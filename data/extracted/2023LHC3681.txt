ABID HUSSAIN CHATTHA, J. The controversy pertains to confrontation 
regarding exercise of powers between the Managing Director / Chief 
Executive Officer (the “CEO”) and Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Sui 
Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (the “SNGPL”) which is a public sector 
listed company as the Federal Government directly or indirectly holds               
57.76 % shares of SNGPL. The Petitioner as the CEO of SNGPL has 
impugned the decisions taken by the Board with respect to seizure of his 
powers as the CEO by appointing an Acting CEO and initiation of inquiry 
against him with other consequential measures in the 600th emergent 
meeting of the Board held on 18.02.2023. 

2 
W. P. No. 12660 of 2023 
2. 
Briefly, the Board of SNGPL on 08.09.2019 advertised the position of 
the CEO on contract basis for a period of 03 years. Five candidates after due 
process were shortlisted and eventually the Board unanimously 
recommended top three candidates for appointment as the CEO including 
the Petitioner to the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) for its 
concurrence. The Federal Government on 23.12.2020 accorded the sought 
concurrence and issued the notification regarding appointment of the 
Petitioner as the CEO of SNGPL on contract basis for a period of 03 years. 
On 31.12.2020, the Board also approved the appointment of the Petitioner as 
the CEO. The Petitioner duly accepted his appointment letter. Accordingly, 
the Board executed service contract and power of attorney in favor of the 
Petitioner to enable him to exercise the statutory powers of the CEO. 
3. 
During the course of service, certain allegations and complaints arose 
against the CEO. The Chairperson of the Board on 17.02.2023 required the 
company Secretary to call an emergent meeting of the Board to discuss 
critical human resource issues with transparency and governance 
implications. The meeting of the Board was held on 18.02.2023. It is alleged 
by Respondents No. 4 to 6 that the Petitioner attempted to cancel or illegally 
disrupt the meeting of the Board and consequently, the meeting was 
conducted via Zoom. The Board after thorough deliberation resolved that the 
Petitioner shall seize to exercise any of his powers as the CEO of SNGPL 
with immediate effect till the Board or a Committee appointed by it, 
expeditiously completes its review of the matters discussed in the Board 
meeting and the Board finally takes a decision with respect to the future of 
the CEO. In this respect, the Board also revoked the power of attorney in 
favour of the Petitioner till further orders and delegated the powers to Mr. 
Amer Tufail, DMD(S) being the senior most officer of SNGPL with 
immediate effect. It was further resolved that a new power of attorney will 
be executed in due course of time in favour of the Acting CEO to enable him 
to exercise all powers and functions germane to the office of the CEO in 
accordance with law in his capacity as Acting CEO. The Board also 
constituted a special Sub-Committee of the Board comprising of two 
members to investigate the conduct of the CEO including any of the 
purported instances of financial irregularities and transgression, particularly 

3 
W. P. No. 12660 of 2023 
relating to Uch Compression Project with direction to submit the report 
within 15 working days. Other consequential measures were also adopted in 
the said meeting of the Board considered necessary for the smooth running 
and operations of SNGPL. 
4. 
The Board statedly consists of 11 members. The impugned meeting of 
the Board was attended by 8 Directors out of which one abstained while 7 
Directors passed the aforesaid resolutions. The Ministry of Energy vide 
letter dated 20.02.2023 communicated the decision of the Board to various 
officers including the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister and the 
Secretaries of the Cabinet and Establishment Divisions, Islamabad. 
5. 
Thereafter, the Petitioner instituted Writ Petition No. 641 / 2023 
before the Islamabad High Court but withdrew the same for filing the same 
before this Court on the ground that Head Office of SNGPL is located at 
Lahore and Respondents No. 4 to 6 being the real contesting parties are also 
based in Lahore. Hence, this Petition. 
6. 
The case of the Petitioner is that he was nominated as the CEO of 
SNGPL by the Federal Government in terms of Section 187(4) read with 
Section 188(2) of the Companies Act, 2017 (the “Companies Act”) and can 
only be removed by the Federal Government. As such, he cannot be 
proceeded against in the manner contemplated by the Board as the position 
of the CEO as well as the Board are statutory stipulations with separate and 
distinct role especially in the context of a public sector company. The 
impugned meeting of the Board was called in a hasty manner in violation of 
stipulated procedure and is, therefore, unlawful not only in terms of 
procedural irregularity but also for the reason that the Board does not have 
any power for suspension of the CEO who can only be removed by three 
fourth majority of the Board as ordained by law.  
7. 
It was further stated that act of the Board of seizing the powers of the 
CEO by suspending him and appointing an Acting CEO in his place is an 
indirect way of circumventing the express provisions of the Companies Act 
and if the same is allowed, the Board of any company would effectively and 
legitimately be empowered to bypass the mandatory statutory stipulations 
and would be able to remove the CEO from his post merely on the strength 
of a simple resolution of the Board. Such a methodology would render the 

4 
W. P. No. 12660 of 2023 
applicable statutory provisions as redundant and will have serious 
consequences for the efficient and transparent operations of the company, 
particularly in the context of a public sector company. Learned counsels for 
the Petitioner also highlighted several instances of irregularities of the 
members of the Board to contend that the act of the Board was in fact based 
on mala fide to prevent the CEO from proceeding against the members of 
the Board and the impugned action is a counter blast by the Board. 
8. 
Conversely, learned counsels for Respondents No. 4 to 6 at the very 
outset raised a number of preliminary objections regarding the 
maintainability of this Petition. It was submitted that SNGPL as a public 
sector listed company is governed by its Board and has no statutory rules of 
service. Moreover, the relationship between the Petitioner and SNGPL is 
contractual in nature as the CEO is employed under a contract of service. 
Hence, no constitutional Petition is competent in the absence of statutory 
rules and in view of the principle of ‘master and servant’. Reliance was 
placed on cases titled, “Qazi Tehmid Ahmed v. Secretary Ministry of 
Petroleum and 3 others” (2015 PLC (C.S.) 449); “Muhammad Naeem 
Akhtar v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Cabinet Division and 
others” decided on 30.01.2023 by the Islamabad High Court in Writ Petition 
No. 3879 / 2022; “Syed Nazir Gillani v. Pakistan Red Crescent Society and 
another” (2014 SCMR 982); “Abdul Wahab and others v. HBL and others” 
(2013 SCMR 1383); “Habib Bank Ltd. v. The State” (2013 SCMR 840); 
“Sui Southern Gas Company Limited and others v. Saeed Ahmed Khoso and 
another” (2022 SCMR 1256); “Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd. 
v. Muhammad Samiullah” (2021 SCMR 998); and “Pakistan Airline Pilots 
Association and others v. Pakistan International Airline and another” (2019 
SCMR 278). 
9. 
The second objection was taken to the effect that the Board has only 
temporarily revoked or withdrawn the delegated powers of the CEO pending 
an inquiry and as such, the discretionary jurisdiction of this Court cannot be 
invoked to interfere in the pending inquiry proceedings. Reliance was placed 
on cases titled, “Habib Bank Limited and others v. Syed Zia-ul-Hassan 
Kazmi” (1998 SCMR 60); “Abdul Malik v. Government of Punjab and 
others” (2019 PLC (C.S.) 764); “Naweed Akhtar Cheema v. Chairperson, 

5 
W. P. No. 12660 of 2023 
TEVTA and others” (2011 PLC (C.S.) 803); “Ms. Serwat Azim v. Sindh 
Bank Limited through President / CEO and 7 others” (2019 PLC (C.S.) 
975); and “Commissioner of Income Tax and others v. Messrs Media 
Network and others” (2006 PTD 2502).  
10. 
The third objection was raised by contending that the Petition is 
premature under the doctrine of ripeness. Reliance was placed upon Naweed 
Akhtar Cheema, Abdul Malik and Ms. Seerwat Azim cases (supra) and cases 
titled, “Mughal-e-Azam Banquet Complex through Managing Partner v. 
Federation of Pakistan through Secretary and 4 others” (2011 PTD 2260); 
“Reliance Commodities (Private) Ltd. v. Federation of Pakistan and others” 
(PLD 2020 Lahore 632); and “Muhammad Hammad ur Rehman Zafar v. 
Director, Federal Investigation Agency, Lahore and another” (PLD 2022 
Lahore 177). 
11. 
As fourth objection, it was stated that proper parties were not 
impleaded in the Petition. The Board has been impleaded though it is not a 
legal person, whereas, the allegation of mala fide was raised by the 
Petitioner against the Chairperson of SNGPL but she was not impleaded as a 
party in her independent right. Reliance was placed on case titled, “Aman 
Ullah Khan and others v. The Federal Government of Pakistan through 
Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Islamabad and others” (PLD 1990 Supreme 
Court 1092). 
12. 
Another objection was levelled to contend that the Petitioner has also 
made allegation of bias but no particulars of the same were specifically 
pleaded and as such, this Petition was not maintainable in view of law laid 
down in cases titled, “Syed Husnain Aamer v. Tehsil Municipal Officer, 
Narowal” (2007 PLC (C.S.) 348); “The Federation of Pakistan through the 
Secretary, Establishment Division, Government of Pakistan Rawalpindi v. 
Saeed Ahmad Khan and others” (PLD 1974 Supreme Court 151); “Dr. 
Akhtar Hassan Khan and others v. Federation of Pakistan and others” (2012 
SCMR 455); and “Tabassum Shahzad v. I.S.I. and others” (2011 SCMR 
1886).  
13. 
Finally, it was submitted that the Committee members of the Board 
were fully empowered to conduct an inquiry against the CEO who are not 
disqualified simply on the basis that they participated in the impugned 

6 
W. P. No. 12660 of 2023 
meeting of the Board in which decision to conduct an inquiry was taken. 
Reliance was placed on case titled, “Baz Muhammad Kakar and others v. 
Federation of Pakistan through Ministry of Law and Justice and others” 
(PLD 2012 Supreme Court 923). 
14. 
On merits, it was submitted that appointment of the Petitioner as the 
CEO of SNGPL was made under Section 187(1) of the Companies Act read 
with Rule 5(2) of Public Sector Companies (Corporate Governance) Rules, 
2013 (the “PSC Rules”) and not under Sections 187(4) and 188(2) of the 
Companies Act as stated by the Petitioner. As such, the Petitioner was not 
nominated by the Federal Government but the latter merely accorded its 
concurrence to the recommendations put forward by the Board through a 
competitive process. In this context, it was stated that ‘nomination’ and 
‘appointment’ have different nomenclature. Sections 186(4) and 187(4) of 
the Companies Act empower the Federal Government to ‘nominate’ the 
CEO, whereas, Section 187(1) of the Companies Act empowers the Board to 
‘appoint’ the CEO. This distinction is evidently made out by conjunctively 
reading the provisions of Section 188 of the Companies Act and is fortified 
by Rule 5(2) of the PSC Rules. Further, Clause 7 of the Public Sector 
Companies (Appointment of Chief Executive) Guidelines, 2015 (the “PSC 
Guidelines”) stipulates that the Board has the power to appoint the CEO and 
issue him an appointment contract embodying the requisite terms and 
conditions of appointment. Learned Counsel relied upon case titled, 
“Waseem Majid Malik v. Federation of Pakistan through Cabinet Secretary 
and 23 others” (2020 CLD 1207) to contend that the Federal Government 
has the option to either nominate the Directors or to put them up for election 
and by analogy, the same principle applied with respect to appointment of 
the CEO. Hence, the Federal Government has the power to nominate the 
CEO and where it exercises this power, it can also determine his terms and 
conditions of appointment but in the present case, the Petitioner was 
appointed as the CEO by the Board which also determined the terms and 
conditions of his appointment under Sections 187(1) and 188(2) of the 
Companies Act read with Rule 5(2) of the PSC Rules. It was emphasized 
that the Petitioner was appointed by the Board and the appointment letter 
was also issued by the Board. The Federal Government merely provided its 

7 
W. P. No. 12660 of 2023 
concurrence to such appointment. Even otherwise, SNGPL being a public 
sector company is governed and run independently by its Board and the 
Federal Government has no jurisdiction in micro managing its affairs 
especially with regard to appointment and removal of the CEO. Reliance 
was placed on cases titled, “Engr. Ghazanfar Ali Khan and others v. F.O.P. 
and others” (PLD 2014 Lahore 375); and “Babar Sattar v. Federation of 
Pakistan through Secretary Ministry of Water and Power and 4 others” 
(2016 CLD 134).  
15. 
Without prejudice to the above, even if the submission of the 
Petitioner is accepted that he was appointed as the CEO by the Federal 
Government, the approval is only required for appointment of the            
CEO and not for his removal since there is no provision which requires that 
only the Federal Government can proceed against the CEO or that its 
approval is required by the Board for removing him. Reliance was placed on 
case titled “Pyare Lal Gupta and another v. D. P. Agarwal and others” 
decided by Allahabad High Court on 23.07.1980. Further, the Federal 
Government has accepted the decision of the Board as depicted vide letter 
dated 20.02.2023 referred above and Respondents No. 1 to 3 in their 
respective reply to this Petition have fully supported the stance of the Board 
of SNGPL with respect to maintainability of this Petition as well as on 
merits. 
16. 
It was also contended that the meeting of the Board was called in 
accordance with the specified procedure since under Rule 6(2) of the PSC 
Rules, the requirement of issuance of 07 days of notice for holding a 
meeting of the Board may be reduced or waived in case of an emergent 
meeting. Further, Article 106 of the Articles of Association of SNGPL 
empowers the Board to regulate their meetings, as the Board thinks fit and 
the Directors may meet together for the dispatch of business, adjourn and 
otherwise regulate their meetings, as they deem appropriate. A Director may, 
and the Secretary on the requisition of a Director shall at any time summon a 
meeting of Directors. As such, 07 days period was duly waived by the Board 
in exercise of powers vested with it. Hence, the objection of holding the 
meeting without the notice of 07 days is baseless especially when no 
member of the Board has raised an objection either to the lack of notice or 

8 
W. P. No. 12660 of 2023 
absence of agenda. Reliance was placed on case titled, “Nadeem Mumtaz 
Qureshi v. Pakistan Petroleum Limited and others” (2019 CLD 1374). 
Therefore, this Court should exercise restraint in interfering in the internal 
management of the company. Reliance was further placed on case titled, 
“Muhammad Suleman Kanjiani and 3 others v. Dadex Eternit Ltd. through 
Chief Executive and 4 others” (2009 CLD 1687). Without prejudice to the 
above, even if there is any irregularity in terms of inadequacy of time in the 
holding of the meeting of the Board, the Court should not interfere where the 
irregularity can be cured through proper course. Reliance was placed on 
cases titled, “Bentley-Stevens v. Jones and others” (1974 2 All ER 653); 
“Muhammad Yousuf Ahmed and 5 others v. Artistic Denim Mills Limited” 
(2021 CLD 134); and “Syed Hasan Masroor Zaidi and others v. Syed 
Ghayoor Zaidi and others” (1988 CLC 1347). 
17. 
It was next contended that the Petitioner has neither been suspended 
nor removed by the Board, rather, only delegated powers have been 
temporarily withdrawn during the pendency of an inquiry against the CEO 
which had been conferred upon him by the Board itself since the power to 
manage the company is vested with the Board and the CEO only exercises 
delegated powers as is evident from the conjunctive reading of Sections 
2(14), 183, 188(1), 192(2) of the Companies Act. It was stressed that 
applicable law makes it abundantly clear that the position of the CEO is 
always subordinate to the Board and the latter is empowered under the law 
to define the respective role and responsibility of the CEO. As such, the 
Board can validly delegate powers to the CEO and conversely can also vary, 
reverse, alter or withdraw such powers from the CEO. Reliance was placed 
on case titled, “Major-General Shanta Shamsher Jung Bahadur Rana v. 
Kamani Brothers Private Ltd. and others” decided on 06.01.1958 by 
Bombay High Court. To emphasize the point, it was specifically stated that 
under the Companies Act, there are no specific powers reserved to be 
exercised by the CEO except to certify the Statutory Meeting under Section 
131, to sign Director’s Report under Section 227, to approve and 
authenticate the Financial Statement under Section 232, to issue notice of 
meeting of creditors under Section 281 and to appear before the Commission 
or Courts under Section 484. 

9 
W. P. No. 12660 of 2023 
18. 
The HR Manual of SNGPL was also quoted to substantiate the point 
that the management has the power to suspend an employee temporarily for 
any of the reasons mentioned in Clauses 113.1 to 113.4 thereof, which are 
fully applicable to the Petitioner as the CEO of SNGPL in terms of Clause 4 
of his appointment letter. Thus, the Petitioner as the CEO of SNGPL is 
merely a delegate of the Board who can curtail his powers to carry out his 
accountability.  
19. 
Elaborating the scope of Section 190 of the Companies Act, it was 
submitted that the Petitioner has not been removed from office but some of 
his powers had been curtailed temporarily in a pending inquiry and as such, 
no question of removal arises in this case in terms of Section 190 of the 
Companies Act which requires removal of the CEO by three fourth majority 
by total number of members of the Board. Further, Article 95 of the Articles 
of Association of SNGPL empowers the Board to vary or alter any power of 
the CEO which has been invoked by the Board requiring a resolution to be 
adopted by a simple majority. This is in line with Section 22(2) of the State-
Owned Enterprises (Governance and Operations) Act, 2023 (the “SOE 
Act”) which stipulates that the decisions of the Board shall be taken by 
majority and only the appointment and removal of the CEO require three 
fourth majority of those present and voting and not by the total members of 
the Board. The impugned decisions were taken by 7 out of total 11 Directors 
and as such, the requirement of Section 22(2) of the SOE Act was also 
fulfilled particularly when the SOE Act applies notwithstanding anything 
contained in any other law for the time being in force and as such, it 
overrides Section 190 of the Companies Act.  
20. 
Finally, it was urged that the allegation of mala fide levelled by the 
CEO against some members of the Board and the Chairperson are 
unsubstantiated and even otherwise, the Board is not subject to any 
accountability by the CEO. Hence, the Petition is liable to be dismissed.  
21. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
22. 
At the very outset, it is imperative to address the objections qua 
maintainability of this Petition raised by the Respondents. It is noted that 
SNGPL is a public sector listed company as 57.76 % of its shares are 

10 
W. P. No. 12660 of 2023 
directly or indirectly held by the Federal Government. It is also a public 
utility company providing gas to two provinces of Pakistan and as such, 
rendering essential services to the people of Pakistan. The controversy raised 
in this Petition, in essence, relates to the operation and governance of 
SNGPL which directly affects the people of Pakistan. The property and 
assets of any public sector company ultimately belongs to the people of 
Pakistan who have a fundamental right to ensure and expect that public 
sector companies are run and operated in accordance with law so that their 
interests and rights are adequately safeguarded. It must always be 
remembered that in case of public sector companies, the members of the 
Board appointed, nominated or elected on the strength of shares held by the 
Federal Government and its entities are always acting as trustees and 
custodians of the people of Pakistan since public property of the Federal 
Government and its entities in the last resort belongs to the people of 
Pakistan. In this respect, the Board of a company consisting of members 
who are also direct owners is different than the Board of a public sector 
company who are not direct owners but exercise their powers as custodian of 
public property. Although, there is no such distinction in terms of law but to 
cater the peculiar nature of public sector companies, multiple laws 
prescribing stringent requirements have been put in place to regulate the 
procedure qua appointment, removal, role and functions of the members of 
the Board and the CEO of public sector companies to achieve the objective 
of transparency, accountability and efficiency in corporate governance.   
23. 
There is no cavil to the proposition that SNGPL has no statutory rules 
of service as a public sector listed company and as such, constitutional 
Petitions with respect to the terms and conditions of service of its employees 
based on service contracts are not maintainable in terms of jurisdiction 
vested in this Court under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan. However, the said rule is not applicable in this case as 
the issues raised in this Petition do not pertain to the terms and conditions of 
service of the Petitioner within the scope of his service contract. Rather, the 
instant Petition involves interpretation of statutory provisions regarding the 
appointment, responsibilities, functions, powers and removal of the CEO 
vis-à-vis and the responsibilities, functions and powers of the Board in order 

11 
W. P. No. 12660 of 2023 
to determine the scope and mandate of the applicable law germane to a 
public sector company which is required to be run and operated in 
accordance with the highest standards of good governance prescribed by 
law. The Petition does not call upon this Court to interpret any term and 
condition of employment of the Petitioner regarding his service benefits in 
lieu of services being rendered by the Petitioner as the CEO of SNGPL. As 
such, the principles of non-existence of any statutory rules of service and 
‘master and servant’ are not applicable in the instant case. Further, the 
Petitioner does not contend that as the CEO of SNGPL, he is not subject to 
accountability or due process with respect to his responsibilities and 
obligations. Therefore, the objection that the discretionary jurisdiction of this 
Court should not be invoked to interfere in the inquiry proceedings against 
the Petitioner is misplaced since this Court is not called upon to opine that 
no accountability regarding the conduct or powers of the CEO can take 
place. The objection to the effect that this Petition is premature under the 
doctrine of ripeness is also not made out as interpretation of statutory 
provisions is the basis of this Petition which is the sole prerogative of this 
Court and is not a function of the Board. The objections that the Board 
should not have been impleaded as party to this Petition as it is not a distinct 
juristic person or that Chairperson of the Board should have been impleaded 
independently on account of assertions casted by the Petitioner against her 
are insignificant and inconsequential. This is for the reason that SNGPL is a 
party to this Petition through its Chairperson who is also the head of the 
Board and as such, each member of the Board has due notice of the same. 
Though, each member of the Board should have ideally be impleaded as 
party to this Petition as the meeting of the Board and decisions taken by the 
Board were impugned yet no member of the Board or the Chairperson filed 
any application to become a party to this Petition. Needless to state that this 
Court has ample powers to add or delete any party as deemed necessary. 
However, as SNGPL is duly represented through its Chairperson and this 
Court does not intend to adjudicate any factual matter relating to any 
personal right of any member of the Board including its Chairperson being 
beyond the scope of constitutional jurisdiction vested in this Court, 
therefore, the objections qua proper parties to this Petition are discarded as 

12 
W. P. No. 12660 of 2023 
immaterial. It is also noted that original jurisdiction under the Companies 
Act also vests in this Court. Learned counsel of Respondents No. 4 to 6 
quoted extensive case law regarding non-maintainability of this Petition 
which has been perused but found distinguishable on facts and as such, is 
not applicable to the peculiar facts and circumstances of the instant case for 
the reasons recorded above. 
24. 
In view of the aforesaid factual context and in the light of the rival 
contentions of the parties, the following primary points for determination are 
framed: 
(i) 
What is the scope and mandate of the office of the CEO vis-à-
vis the role and functions of the Board of a public sector 
company? and 
(ii) 
Whether the acts and decisions of the Board of SNGPL 
regarding initiation of inquiry against the CEO, ceasing of the 
powers of the CEO by withdrawing the power of attorney 
executed in his favour, appointment of the Acting CEO and 
conferring of powers of the CEO to him by executing a fresh 
power of attorney in his favour are in accordance with law? 
25. 
The Companies Act envisages different kinds of companies and the 
company law of Pakistan differs in terms of its applicability depending upon 
the type of company. The most stringent standards are prescribed with 
respect to the operation and governance of a public sector company in order 
to protect public property and ensure good governance. It is important to 
mention that the SOE Act was promulgated on 30.01.2023. The objective is 
aptly described in the preamble of the SOE Act which stipulates that the 
governance and operation of state-owned enterprises, if not made effective, 
affects fiscal discipline and quality of service delivery by the State. Section 
36 of the SOE Act saves all acts and laws including appointment of any 
officer prior to the coming into force of the SOE Act but mandates that 
within one year from its coming into effect, the Federal Government shall, in 
the case of any inconsistency, initiate legislation to bring the laws of state-
owned enterprises in conformity with the provisions of the SOE Act. 
Notwithstanding the same, the SOE Act came into force at once and is fully 

13 
W. P. No. 12660 of 2023 
applicable subject to the caveats stated above. Therefore, this Court is 
cognizant of the fact that the events of appointment of the CEO of SNGPL 
are prior in time from the date of promulgation of the SOE Act and some 
grace period is still available to the Federal Government to hammer out the 
inconsistencies among various applicable laws regarding the regulation of 
public sector companies yet the provisions of the SOE Act which are not 
inconsistent with laws or relate to events subsequent to its promulgation are 
fully attracted to decide the issues raised in this Petition as the provisions 
thereof also effectively disclose the intention of the legislature with respect 
to the functioning and operations of public sector companies.  
26. 
Section 4 of the Companies Act expressly provides that the provisions 
of the Companies Act preempt anything contained in any other law or the 
Memorandum or Articles of a company or in any contract or agreement 
executed by the company or any resolution passed by the company in 
general meeting by its shareholders or by its Board and any such provision 
or resolution to the extent of its inconsistency with any provision of the 
Companies Act would be void. However, Section 3 of the SOE Act states 
that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being 
in force, the SOE Act shall have application to all public sector companies 
as defined in Section 2(54) of the Companies Act which are owned and 
controlled by the Federal Government. Section 2(54) of the Companies Act 
defines a public sector company as follows:   
““public sector company” means a company, whether public or 
private, which is directly or indirectly controlled, beneficially owned 
or not less than fifty-one percent of the voting securities or voting 
power of which are held by the Government or any agency of the 
Government or a statutory body, or in respect of which the 
Government or any agency of the Government or a statutory body, has 
otherwise power to elect, nominate or appoint majority of its directors 
and includes a public sector association not for profit, licensed under 
Section 42: 
Provided that nomination of directors by the Commission on the board 
of the securities exchange or any other entity or operation of any other 
law shall not make it a public sector company.” 
 
 
27. 
The SOE Act is a special and subsequent Statute relating to a public 
sector company and as such, preempts the provisions of the Companies Act, 

14 
W. P. No. 12660 of 2023 
in case of any inconsistency between the two enactments. Therefore, as a 
rule of construction, a command of law in the SOE Act would preempt an 
inconsistent provision of the Companies Act and a statutory stipulation in 
the Companies Act would override anything inconsistent in the 
Memorandum and Articles of Association of the company or an agreement 
executed by the company or any resolution passed by the company in 
general meeting by its shareholders or the Board.  
28. 
Similarly, Section 2(d)(i) of the SOE Act defines the term ‘controlled 
by the Government’ in the case of a company with reference to the right of 
the Federal Government to appoint a majority of Directors or control over 
management or policy decisions, exercisable by a person individually or 
through any person acting in concert, directly or indirectly, whether by 
virtue of Federal Government shareholding, management right, shareholders 
agreement, voting agreement or otherwise. Section 2(j) of the SOE Act 
defines the term ‘owned by the Federal Government’ in the case of a 
company to mean an entity in which the Federal Government directly or 
indirectly holds 50% or more shareholding. Section 2(e) of the SOE Act 
describes a ‘commercial state-owned enterprise’ as a state-owned enterprise 
that generates the majority of its revenue from the sale of goods or services 
or a combination of both on a commercial basis. Since the Federal 
Government directly or indirectly holds 57.76 % shares in SNGPL, and as 
such, has the power to elect, nominate or appoint majority of its Directors, 
and exercise control over policy and management decisions, therefore, the 
latter is a public sector company in terms of Section 2(54) of the Companies 
Act. As SNGPL is listed on the stock exchange and its remaining shares are 
held by dispersed private persons, it is also a listed company. At the same 
time, SNGPL is a commercial state-owned enterprise in terms of Section 
2(e) of the SOE Act as it has been established under the Companies Act and 
also generates the majority of its revenue from the sale of goods or services 
or a combination of both on a commercial basis.  
29. 
Section 4 of the SOE Act requires the Federal Government once in 
every five years to prepare and prescribe a state-owned enterprise 
Ownership and Management Policy for giving effect to its objectives. The 
policy includes the role of the Federal Government in the governance of 

15 
W. P. No. 12660 of 2023 
state-owned enterprises, the manner and procedure for exercising the rights 
of the Federal Government as shareholder in state-owned enterprises, 
clarification of the respective roles and responsibilities of any division of the 
Federal Government under the Rules of Business, 1973, the Board and other 
stakeholders involved in the implementation of the policy, guidelines for the 
Board nominations committee, the manner of regulation of conflict of 
interest of Directors, and any other matter required to give effect to the 
provisions and objectives of the SOE Act. Section 4(3)(a)(ii) of the SOE Act 
specifically states that the policy shall clarify the manner of giving effect to 
the institutional arrangements, whereby, roles and responsibilities have been 
assigned under this Act, in particular and without limitation, the manner in 
which the Board shall undertake its responsibilities with regard to the 
appointment of the CEO. Chapter 5 of the SOE Act pertains to responsible 
management and Section 9 thereof specifically states that this Chapter shall 
apply to all Boards of state-owned enterprises, notwithstanding anything 
contained in any other law for the time being in force. Section 13(2) 
provides that an independent Director once appointed by the Federal 
Government shall not be removed unless it is established through any 
inquiry conducted in the prescribed manner. Section 15 of the SOE Act 
relates to the Chairman of the Board and the CEO. Sub-Section 2 thereof 
states that the Chairman of the Board shall be appointed by the Federal 
Government and shall be responsible for leading the Board and ensuring its 
effective functioning and continuous development and shall not be involved 
in day-to-day operations of the state-owned enterprise. Sub-Section 3 thereof 
stipulates that the CEO shall be responsible for the management of the state-
owned enterprise and for its procedures in financial and other matters under 
delegation from the Board and subject to the oversight and directions of the 
Board. The CEO shall be responsible for the proper implementation of 
strategies and polices approved by the Board. Chapter 6 of the SOE Act 
relates to responsibilities, powers and functions of the Board. Section 17 of 
the SOE Act provides that the Board shall be given autonomy and 
independence in the discharge of its functions under the law and no 
administrative or standing instructions by any division of the Federal 
Government shall be applicable to any state-owned enterprises unless prior 

16 
W. P. No. 12660 of 2023 
approval of the Federal Government has been obtained and any such 
instructions already in field at the time of coming into effect of this Act shall 
require ratification of the Federal Government within a period of six months, 
failing which they shall be deemed to be rescinded. 
30. 
Section 18 of the SOE Act stipulates that the Board, in the case of a 
company, shall appoint the CEO under a performance-based contract for a 
specified period. The Board is an under obligation for ensuring the 
performance of the CEO through regular monitoring against agreed 
performance measure. Section 20 of the SOE Act stipulates that the Board 
shall ensure the integrity of the systems of internal control and any person 
who is found liable for a deviation or violation from the company’s code of 
conduct or other systems of internal control shall be subject to disciplinary 
proceedings in accordance with the internal policies of state-owned 
enterprise. The Board under Section 21 of the SOE Act is also empowered to 
establish an audit committee which in turn is also empowered to investigate, 
where necessary on a confidential basis, any deviation from or violation of 
the company’s code of conduct or other systems of internal control. Section 
22 of the SOE Act states that the Board shall meet at least once in every two 
months or at other times when the Board considers necessary for the 
efficient management of the business and affairs of the state-owned 
enterprise. Sub-Section 2 thereof further states that notwithstanding anything 
contained in any other law for the time being in force, decisions of the Board 
shall be taken by majority, however, the specified decisions shall require a 
decision by three fourth majority of the Board which shall include the vote 
of the nominee Director representing the Federal or Provincial Government 
and extends to the appointment and removal of the CEO of the state-owned 
enterprise.  
31. 
Like every other company, a public sector company is managed by the 
CEO. The term is defined in Section 2(14) of the Companies Act as follows: 
 ““chief executive”, in relation to a company means an individual 
who, subject to control and directions of the board, is entrusted with 
whole, or substantially whole, of the powers of management of affairs 
of the company and includes a director or any other person occupying 
the position of a chief executive, by whatever name called, and 
whether under a contract of service or otherwise.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
      (Underlining is mine)  

17 
W. P. No. 12660 of 2023 
32. 
The definition of the CEO in the Articles of Association of SNGPL is 
not inconsistent with Section 2(14) of the Companies Act and importantly 
defines the CEO as follows: 
“"Chief Executive" means a person so appointed by the Board, given 
the designation of Managing Director or any other designation in 
whom shall vest the powers and functions in relation to the 
management and administration of the affairs of the company.” 
 
     
 
 
 
 
 
 
      (Underlining is mine) 
 
33. 
It follows from the above that the CEO of the company is the most 
important person in the sense that law confers the responsibility of 
administration and management of the company to the CEO. This is his full-
time role and responsibility as the executive head of the company. The 
appointment of the CEO is prescribed in Sections 186 and 187 of the 
Companies Act which for ready reference are reproduced as under:-  
“186. Appointment of first chief executive. 
 
(1) Every company shall have a chief executive appointed in the 
manner provided in this section and section 187.  
 
(2) 
The name of first chief executive shall be determined by the 
subscribers of the memorandum and his particulars specified under 
section 197 shall be submitted along with the documents for the 
incorporation of the company.  
 
(3) 
The first chief executive shall, unless he earlier resigns or 
otherwise ceases to hold office, hold office up to the first annual 
general meeting of the company or, if a shorter period is fixed by the 
subscribers at the time of his appointment, for such period.  
 
(4) 
Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, the 
Government shall have the power to nominate chief executive of a 
public sector company in such manner as may be specified. 
  
187. Appointment of subsequent chief executive. 
 
(1) Within fourteen days from the date of election of directors under 
section 159 or the office of the chief executive falling vacant, as the 
case may be, the board shall appoint any person, including an elected 
director, to be the chief executive, but such appointment shall not be 
for a period exceeding three years from the date of appointment: 
 
Provided that the chief executive appointed against a casual vacancy 
shall hold office till the directors elected in the next election appoint a 
chief executive.  

18 
W. P. No. 12660 of 2023 
 
(2) 
On the expiry of his term of office under section 186 or sub-
section (1) of this section, a chief executive shall be eligible for 
reappointment.  
 
(3) 
The chief executive retiring under section 186 or this section 
shall continue to perform his functions until his successor is 
appointed, unless non-appointment of his successor is due to any fault 
on his part or his office is expressly terminated.  
 
(4) 
Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, the 
Government shall have the power to nominate chief executive of a 
company where majority of directors is nominated by the 
Government, in such manner as may be specified. 
 
188. Terms of appointment of chief executive. 
 
(1) Save as provided in sub-section (2), the terms and conditions of 
appointment of a chief executive shall be determined by the board or 
the company in general meeting in accordance with the provisions in 
the company’s articles.  
 
(2) 
The terms and conditions of appointment of a chief executive 
nominated under section 186 or 187 shall be determined by the 
Government, in such manner as may be specified.  
 
(3) 
The chief executive shall if he is not already a director of the 
company, be deemed to be its director and be entitled to all the rights 
and privileges, and subject to all the liabilities, of that office.” 
 
      (Underlining is mine) 
 
34. 
Article 95 of the Articles of Association of SNGPL dealing with the 
appointment of the CEO reads as under: 
“The Directors may make the appointment of the chief executive on 
such terms and may from time to time vest in or assign to chief 
executive such powers, discretions and duties and may impose on him 
such regulations, as may seem expedient. The Directors shall fix 
salary, allowance and such perquisites of chief executive as they deem 
fit.” 
      (Underlining is mine) 
 
35. 
Perusal of the above provisions makes it clear that Section 186(2) and 
(3) of the Companies Act only deal with respect to appointment of the first 
CEO. In the instant case, the matter relates to appointment of the subsequent 
CEO. It follows that ordinarily the Board has the power to appoint the CEO 
for a maximum period of three years. However, the general and ordinary 

19 
W. P. No. 12660 of 2023 
power of appointment under Section 187(1) of the Companies Act is subject 
to Section 186(4) or 187(4) of the Companies Act which gives an unfettered 
right to the Government to nominate the CEO of the public sector company 
or the company where majority of the Directors are nominated by the 
Government in the manner as it may be specified. Therefore, the 
Government has two options. It may follow the procedure of appointment of 
the CEO under Section 187(1) of the Companies Act by not exercising its 
exclusive power of nomination under Section 186(4) or 187(4) of the 
Companies Act or vice versa. 
36. 
 Thus, Section 187(1) empowers the Board to appoint any person 
including an elected Director as the CEO for a maximum period of three 
years with a caveat that the CEO appointed against the causal vacancy shall 
hold office till the Directors elected in the next election appoint the CEO. 
The retiring CEO is required to continue to perform his functions until his 
successor is appointed, unless non-appointment of his successor is due to 
any fault on his part or his office is expressly terminated.  The Board or the 
shareholders in the general meeting under Section 188(1) of the Companies 
Act are empowered to determine the terms and conditions of appointment of 
the CEO. Flexibility is provided by law to the shareholders to opt one of the 
two ways by incorporating their choice in the Articles of Association. 
Article 95 of the Articles of Association of SNGPL vest this power with the 
Board. In case of a nominated CEO under Section 186(4) or 187(4) of the 
Companies Act, the terms and conditions are determined by the 
Government.  
37. 
The appointment of the CEO of a public sector company in terms of 
Section 187(1) of the Companies Act is further regulated under the PSC 
Guidelines which stipulate that such appointment must be based on ‘fit and 
proper criteria’ specified in Schedule II of the PSC Guidelines. It is 
mandated that the CEO must continuously meet the fit and proper criteria in 
terms of his performance and the requirement is so stringent that Clause 3 of 
the PSC Guidelines provides that at any time during the term of his office, if 
it is found that the CEO has failed to meet the same, the Board may remove 
him before the expiration of his term in office in accordance with Section 
190 of the Act. The relevant process of appointment of the CEO in terms of 

20 
W. P. No. 12660 of 2023 
fit and proper criteria is specified in Schedule I of the PSC Guidelines. It 
prescribes mandatory advertisement, shortlisting process, evaluation of 
shortlisted candidates and the Interviewing process. Rule 5(2) of the PSC 
Rules deals with the responsibility of the Board in this respect. It provides as 
under:-  
“The Board shall evaluate the candidates based on the fit and 
proper criteria and the guidelines specified by the Commission 
for appointment to the position of the chief executive and 
recommend at least three candidates to the Government for its 
concurrence for appointment of one of them as chief executive 
of the public sector company, except where the chief executive 
is nominated by the Government. On receiving concurrence or 
nomination of the Government, as the case may be, the Board 
shall appoint the chief executive in accordance with the 
provisions of the Act. The Board shall also be responsible for 
development and succession planning of the chief executive.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    (Underlining is mine) 
38. 
The Board is required to make recommendations to the competent 
authority in terms of Clause 6 which leads to appointment of the CEO under 
Clause 7 of Schedule I of the PSC Guidelines which are reproduced as 
under:-    
“6. Recommendation from the Board to the Competent Authority.   
 
(1)  
The Board shall recommend a minimum of three candidates to 
the line ministry for appointment to the position of Chief Executive.  
 
(2)  
Copy of the minutes of meeting of the Board recommending the 
shortlisted candidates shall be forwarded to the line ministry for 
information and perusal. 
 
(3) 
 If the line ministry does not concur to appoint any of the 
proposed candidates, it shall highlight the reasons for non-
concurrence and refer the matter back to the public sector company 
for reconsideration and with the direction to identify additional / 
alternative candidates. 
 
(4)  
The Board may either re-evaluate the candidates from the pool 
of available applicants or reinitiate the appointment process, if none of 
the shortlisted candidates is found fit and proper for the position. 
 
(5)  
The candidates shall be recommended to the line ministry in the 
order of preference based on the results of evaluation. 
 
 

21 
W. P. No. 12660 of 2023 
7.  
Appointment of Chief Executive. 
  
(1)  
Upon concurrence of the competent authority, the Board shall 
appoint the chief executive and issue him a contract letter, with the 
requisite terms and conditions of appointment, signed by the 
Chairman, or other person authorized by the Board. 
 
(2)  
It shall be ensured that the appointment of chief executive is 
finalized at least thirty days before the date of expiry of the term of 
the incumbent chief executive so that the appointment is made by the 
Board within the period stipulated under sections 198 and 199 of the 
Ordinance.” 
     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     (Underlining is mine) 
39. 
Further, Rule 5(c)(ii) of the PSC Rules empowers the Board                     
in order to ensure equality of opportunity to establish open and fair 
procedures for making appointments. Further, the Board is allowed to 
determine the terms and conditions of service and may also nominate a 
committee consisting of one of its members or senior Executives                     
for investigating, where necessary on a confidential basis any deviation                     
from code of conduct of the company. 
40. 
Therefore, it is evident that notwithstanding the power of nomination 
of the CEO vested with the Federal Government under Section                     
187(4) of the Companies Act, the Federal Government did not exercise the 
power of nomination regarding the CEO of SNGPL and followed the 
process of the appointment of the CEO prescribed under Section                     
187(1) of the Companies Act read with the PSC Guidelines and the PSC 
Rules. The Board of SNGPL followed an advertised competitive process 
through which the Petitioner was shortlisted and his name was included in 
the panel of three shortlisted candidates recommended by the Board to the 
Federal Government seeking its concurrence to one of the three candidates. 
The Federal Government concurred with the name of the Petitioner whose 
name was second in priority, whereafter, the notification was issued                     
by the Federal Government. The Board, thereafter, issued the                     
letter of appointment to the Petitioner and upon its acceptance, the service 
contract was duly executed between SNGPL and the Petitioner. The 
procedure adopted by the Board in appointment of the CEO is in conformity 
with 
Section 
18(1) 
of 
the 
SOE 
Act 
which 
deals 
with 
the                     
appointment of the CEO and ordains that the Board, in the case of a 

22 
W. P. No. 12660 of 2023 
company shall appoint the CEO of the state-owned enterprise under a 
performance contract for a specified period. Hence, the contention of the 
Petitioner that he was not appointed by the Board but nominated by the 
Federal Government is misplaced.    
41. 
The powers, functions and duties of the CEO are spelled out in 
Section 15(3) of the SOE Act which is reproduced as under:- 
“(a)  be responsible for the management of the state-owned 
enterprise and for its procedures in financial and other matters 
under delegation from the Board and subject to the oversight 
and directions of the Board; 
 
(b)  
ensure the proper implementation of strategies and policies 
approved by the Board; and 
 
(c)  
putting in place appropriate arrangements to ensure that funds 
and resources are properly safeguarded and are used 
economically, efficiently and effectively and in accordance with 
the state-owned enterprise business plan, the primary objective 
and all statutory obligations.”  
     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     (Underlining is mine) 
42. 
The Companies Act, as already stated above, by way of statutory 
command vests the power of administration and management of the 
company on day-to-day basis upon the CEO. Rule 4(3) of the PSC Rules 
explaining the functions of the CEO states as under:- 
“The chief executive is responsible for the management of the Public 
Sector Company and for its procedures in financial and other matters, 
subject to the oversight and directions of the Board, in accordance 
with the Act and these rules. His responsibilities include 
implementation of strategies and policies approved by the Board, 
making appropriate arrangements to ensure that funds and resources 
are properly safeguarded and are used economically, efficiently and 
effectively and in accordance with all statutory obligations.” 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
      (Underlining is mine) 
43. 
Therefore, the vesting of powers and functions in the CEO by the 
Board is a statutory command which cannot be refused in the applicable 
scheme of law. The Board cannot at the same time appoint the CEO and 
refuse to vest such powers and functions in him through appropriate 
instruments which are necessary for the CEO to perform his statutory duties 
to manage and operate the company. To understand the scheme of law, the 
provision contained in Section 188(3) of the Companies Act is of immense 

23 
W. P. No. 12660 of 2023 
significance which proclaims that if the CEO is not a Director of the 
company, he is deemed to be its Director and is entitled to all the rights and 
privileges and subject to all the liabilities of that office. Hence, the CEO 
being also a Director of the company, is also the member of the Board. The 
difference then emerges that the CEO is entrusted with the management and 
administration of the company as a whole time Executive head of the 
company in contrast to Directors whose role and functions are part-time 
limited to overall control and oversight of the company.   
44. 
Section 18(2) of SOE Act spelling out the powers and functions of the 
Board proclaims that the Board shall be responsible for ensuring the 
performance and regular monitoring of the CEO against agreed performance 
measures and his development and succession planning. Section 183 of the 
Companies Act lists the powers of the Board in the following terms:- 
“(1)  The business of a company shall be managed by the board, who 
may exercise all such powers of the company as are not by this Act, or 
by the articles, or by a special resolution, required to be exercised by 
the company in general meeting.  
 
(2)  
The board shall exercise the following powers on behalf of the 
company, and shall do so by means of a resolution passed at their 
meeting, namely: …..” 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     (Underlining is mine) 
45. 
The Board is headed by the Chairman. Section 15(1) of the SOE Act 
differentiates between the role of the CEO and the Chairman of the Board. It 
provides that no person can hold office as Chairman and the CEO of a state-
owned enterprise simultaneously, and the office of the Chairman shall be 
separate and his responsibilities distinct, from those of the CEO. Section 
15(2) of the SOE Act further adds that the Chairman of the Board shall be 
appointed by the Federal Government and shall be responsible for leading 
the Board and ensuring its effective functioning and continuous development 
and shall not be involved in day-to-day operations of the state-owned 
enterprise. The Board in terms of Section 192(2) of the Companies Act is 
obligated to clearly define the respective roles and responsibilities of the 
Chairman and the CEO of a listed company. It is importantly stated that 
none of the powers vested under Section 183(2) of the Companies Act relate 
to any action against the CEO, whereas, the Companies Act specifically 

24 
W. P. No. 12660 of 2023 
imposes limitation on the powers of the Board to the effect that the Board 
cannot exercise any power that is liable to be exercised by the shareholders 
under the Companies Act or the Articles or by a special resolution. At the 
same time, neither the CEO nor the Board or the shareholders of a company 
can exercise any power that is in contravention to the express statutory 
dictates enshrined in any applicable law. Hence, the functions of the CEO 
can only be performed by him and by no one else. The Board cannot deviate 
from the statutory command. This leads to all important question as to what 
the Board may do when it for any reason is dissatisfied from the CEO. The 
answer is embodied in Section 22(2) and (3) of the SOE Act which for ready 
reference is detailed below:- 
“(2)  Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the 
time being in force, decisions of the Board shall be taken by majority, 
however, the following decisions shall require a decision by three-
fourth majority, which shall include the vote of the nominee director 
representing the Federal or Provincial Government, namely— 
(a)  
appointment and removal of chief executive officer of the state- 
owned enterprise; 
(b)  
approval of the statement of corporate intent and business plan; 
(c)  
proposals for sale of sizeable assets; 
(d)  
annual budget statement approval; and 
(e)  
sale of assets of the company. 
 
(3)  
The Chairman of the Board shall in case of equal number of 
votes, have a casting vote.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Underlining is mine) 
46. 
Section 190 of the Companies Act which allows the Board to remove 
the CEO reads as under: 
“190. Removal of chief executive. 
 
(1)  
The board by resolution passed by not less than three-fourths of 
the total number of directors for the time being, or the company by a 
special resolution, may remove a chief executive before the expiration 
of his term of office notwithstanding anything contained in the articles 
or in any agreement between the company and such chief executive.  
 
(2) 
Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, the 
Government or an authority or a person authorized by it shall have the 
power to remove chief executive of a company where more than 
seventy-five percent of the voting rights are held by the Government.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Underlining is mine) 
 

25 
W. P. No. 12660 of 2023 
47. 
Article 97 of the Articles of Association of SNGPL regarding the 
power of the Board to remove the CEO reads as under:- 
“The Directors of the Company by resolution passed by not less than 
three-fourth of the total number of Directors for the time being, or the 
Company by a special resolution, may remove the chief executive 
before the expiration of his term of office notwithstanding anything 
contained in the Articles or in any agreement between the Company 
and such chief executive.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     (Underlining is mine) 
48. 
Rule 7(1) of the PSC Rules provides that the Board shall establish 
appropriate arrangements to ensure that it has access to all relevant 
information, advice and resources necessary to enable it to carry out its role 
effectively. Significant issues shall be placed before the Board for its 
information and consideration, in order to formalize and strengthen the 
corporate decision-making process. Rule 7(2) of the PSC Rules lists 
significant issues which conspicuously does not specifically include the 
removal of the CEO which fortifies the conclusion that it is dealt with under 
the aforesaid express statutory provisions.    
49. 
It is explicitly manifest from the above provisions of law that Section 
190 of the Companies Act importantly stipulates that the Board by not less 
than three fourth of the total number of Directors for the time being or the 
company by a special resolution, may remove the CEO before the expiration 
of his term of office, notwithstanding anything contained in the Articles or in 
any agreement executed by the company. Thus, the right to remove the CEO 
is concurrently conferred upon the Board and the shareholders. However, 
stringent statutory threshold beyond simple majority is prescribed given the 
peculiar and utmost important office of the CEO to guard and protect that 
office against extraneous factors, blackmailing and victimizing in the best 
interest of the company, particularly, the interests of the minority 
shareholders which otherwise, may be jeopardized by oppression of 
majority. Once again, Section 190(2) of the Companies Act provides that 
notwithstanding anything contained in this Section, the Government or an 
authority or a person authorized by it shall have the power to remove the 
CEO of the company where more than 75% of the voting rights are held by 
the Government. Needless to say that the said provision is not attracted in 
the instant case as the Federal Government holds less than 75% shares in 

26 
W. P. No. 12660 of 2023 
SNGPL. There is no inconsistency between the provisions of Section 22(2) 
of the SOE Act, Section 190 of the Companies Act and Article 97 of the 
Articles of Association of SNGPL with respect to removal of the CEO.  
Section 22(2)(a) of the SOE Act mandates that the CEO cannot be removed 
by the Board except by a resolution passed by three fourth majority. It does 
not say that resolution by three fourth majority of the Board will be passed 
by the Directors ‘present or voting’ or by the ‘total members’ of the Board.  
Hence, the stipulation contained in Section 190(1) of the Companies Act and 
Article 97 of the Articles of Association of SNGPL would prevail mandating 
three fourth majority of ‘total members’ of the Board. Thus, all the three 
cited provisions would become harmonious to each other in conformity with 
the cardinal principle of interpretation of statutes requiring harmonious 
construction of provisions. Therefore, the CEO of SNGPL can be removed 
by the Board by a resolution passed by not less than three fourth of the total 
number of Directors for the time being on the Board of SNGPL or by the 
shareholders of SNGPL by a special resolution which also requires three 
fourth majority of the shareholders in terms of Section 2(66) of the 
Companies Act. It is reiterated that Clause 3 of Schedule-II to the PSC 
Guidelines provides that where at any point of time, it has been found that 
the CEO has failed to meet the fit and proper criteria during the term of his 
office, the Directors of the company may remove him before the expiration 
of his term of office in accordance with the provisions of Section 190 of the 
Act. Therefore, it is established beyond doubt that the only course available 
to the Board against the CEO of the company is to seek his removal as 
ordained by law.   
50. 
Section 22(1) of the SOE Act mandates that the Board of the company 
shall meet at least once in every two months and at other times that the 
Board considers necessary for the efficient management of the business and 
affairs of the state-owned enterprise. Rule 6(2) of the PSC Rules stipulates 
the conditions of meetings of the Board and provides that written notice of 
meetings, including the agenda, duly approved by the Chairman, shall be 
circulated not less than seven days before the meetings, except in the case of 
emergency meetings, where the notice period may be reduced or waived by 
the Board. Rule 6(5) of the PSC Rules also stipulates that the Board meeting  

27 
W. P. No. 12660 of 2023 
held and attended through video-conferencing shall be a valid meeting, as 
long as its proceedings are properly recorded and the requirements specified 
by the Commission for public companies for holding the Board meetings 
through video-conferencing are met. Importantly, Rule 8(1) of the PSC 
Rules provides that the performance evaluation of members of the Board 
including the Chairman and the CEO shall be undertaken annually by the 
Government for which the Government shall enter into performance contract 
with each member of the Board at the time of his appointment. Rule 12(1)(c) 
of the PSC Rules authorizes the Board to set up various committees in 
performing its functions efficiently and for seeking assistance in the 
decision-making process which include human resource committee dealing 
with all employees relating matters including performance evaluation. 
Protection is also accorded to chief financial officer, company secretary and 
chief internal auditor in terms of their appointment and removal and it has 
been stipulated in Sub-Rule 3 thereof that the chief financial officer, the 
company secretary, or the chief internal auditor of public sector company 
shall not be removed except with the approval of the Board.       
51. 
The next aspect of the case is with respect to the conduct and holding 
of meeting of the Board and the decisions taken therein regarding initiation 
of inquiry against the CEO, suspension and withdrawal of his powers, 
appointment of Acting CEO and conferring of powers of the CEO to the 
Acting CEO. In the scheme of law enunciated above, there is no cavil to the 
proposition that the Board was well within its right to order initiation of 
inquiry against the CEO in case, the Board came to the conclusion that there 
was sufficient material which warranted such an inquiry which was 
necessary before proceeding for his removal. However, the inquiry 
proceedings being conducted by a Committee of Directors constituted by the 
Board could well proceed without preventing the CEO to perform his 
functions under the law. Rather, the law provides unfettered procedure and 
powers to the Board to remove the CEO even without conducting any 
inquiry, whatsoever, if the Board reaches to the conclusion that for any 
reason in the discretion of the Board, the removal of the CEO is in the best 
interest of the company. However, by not adopting and following the laid 
down procedure and exercise of statutory powers vested with the Board, the 

28 
W. P. No. 12660 of 2023 
latter adopted an indirect way of removing the CEO, thus, violating the 
specific mandatory provisions of applicable law. It is well entrenched in our 
jurisprudence that what cannot be done directly, must not be done indirectly. 
In the instant case, the mandatory express statutory provisions barred the 
Board to clinch such powers of the CEO which may have hindered him to 
perform his statutory functions as required by law.  
52. 
It is also noted that this Court does not intend to go into the question 
of validity or invalidity of the meeting of the Board in which the impugned 
resolutions were passed as it is within the powers and functions of the Board 
to convene and hold their meetings. The alleged irregularity involves factual 
inquiry and as such, not warranted as the same is even not required to 
determine the pivotal question before this Court. However, it may be 
observed that in case of an inquiry, a proper conventional meeting of the 
Board should have been called with a notice of seven days with a specific 
agenda to hold discussion on the allegations against the CEO and in such a 
meeting, the CEO may have been duly confronted with the same. In case, 
the Board deemed it necessary, it may well in the presence of the CEO, 
initiate any necessary investigation or inquiry and may have constituted a 
committee for the purpose in accordance with law. The bare reading of the 
minutes of the impugned Board meeting establishes that the alleged charges 
against the CEO did not by any stretch of imagination required calling of an 
‘emergent meeting’ with less than one day notice with a generalized, vague 
and subjective agenda by dispensing the requirement of notice of seven 
days. This is especially so when the matter related to charges against the 
CEO was ‘most significant’ and ‘extremely important’. Suffice is to hold 
that holding and conduct of impugned meeting of the Board was in sheer 
violation of principles of good governance detailed above under various 
applicable provisions of law that created a management and administrative 
crises in SNGPL which was not only detrimental for the shareholders but 
also adversely affected the provision of services to the people. 
53. 
The contention of the Respondents that the Board had itself delegated 
powers upon the CEO and as such, had all the right to withdraw the same is 
misconceived to the extent that such powers could have been exercised only 
in accordance with law. This means that such powers could not have been 

29 
W. P. No. 12660 of 2023 
withdrawn which had the effect to prevent the CEO to run the operation and 
management of the company as required by statutory provisions. The mere 
fact of conferring such power to the Acting CEO itself demonstrates that the 
statutory functioning of the CEO was infringed and impaired which was 
beyond the scope of powers to be exercised by the Board. Thus, by 
withdrawing the powers of the CEO, the Board violated the mandate of 
the CEO with respect to his statutory powers regarding management and 
administration of the company. It may also be mentioned that the reliance 
by the Respondents upon HR manual of SNGPL is misplaced for the 
reason that the power of suspension listed therein does not preempt the 
statutory provisions and even otherwise, the provisions relate to an 
employee and not a statutory officer or override statutory stipulations. 
   
54. 
The following conclusions are, therefore, safely drawn from the 
examination of the scheme of applicable law: 
(i) 
The offices of the CEO, Chairman and member of the Board are 
separate and independent in terms of appointment, removal, role, 
powers and functions which are regulated by mandatory provisions 
of law and the same cannot be circumvented or made redundant by 
exercise of discretionary and general powers vested in any of such 
offices; 
(ii) 
The process of appointment and removal of the CEO is regulated 
by specific mandatory legal provisions which preempt the general 
role of oversight, supervision and control of the Board over the 
CEO;   
(iii) Notwithstanding the power of nomination of the CEO vested with 
the Federal Government under Section 187(4) of the Companies 
Act, the Federal Government did not exercise the power of 
nomination regarding the incumbent CEO of SNGPL and followed 
the process of the appointment prescribed under Section 187(1) of 
the Companies Act read with the PSC Guidelines and PSC Rules; 
(iv) 
The incumbent CEO is also a Director of SNGPL and as a member 
of the Board has the same powers, functions and responsibilities as 
any other member of the Board; 

30 
W. P. No. 12660 of 2023 
(v) 
The processes of appointment and removal of the CEO are separate 
and distinct and does not have any co-relation with each other;  
(vi) 
There is no role of the Federal Government in the removal of the 
incumbent CEO of SNGPL as the Federal Government does not 
hold more than 75% shares in SNGPL as ordained by Section 
190(2) of the Companies Act;      
(vii) Therefore, the incumbent CEO of SNGPL can only be removed in 
accordance with the mandatory provisions of Section 190 of the 
Companies Act requiring three fourth of total membership of the 
Board being not inconsistent with Section 22 of the SOE Act;  
(viii) The Board is obligated to delegate such powers to the CEO as are 
necessary to enable the CEO to perform the statutory duty of 
administration and management of the Company;  
(ix) 
Such powers cannot be withdrawn but the CEO can be removed 
even without inquiry under Section 190 of the Companies Act. 
However, if the Board deems appropriate, the Board can initiate an 
inquiry against the CEO before removing him from office but 
without seizure of his powers. If immediate measures are required 
to be taken against the CEO, the only course available is to follow 
the procedure of removal of the CEO under Section 190 of the 
Companies Act;        
(x) 
There is no provision in the law for the appointment of Acting 
CEO in the presence of existing CEO. As such, the acts of the 
Board of SNGPL of suspending the incumbent CEO and / or 
withdrawing his powers, appointing the Acting CEO and 
conferring him the powers of the CEO were unlawful, illegal and 
void-ab-initio being in violation of Section 190 of the Companies 
Act; and 
(xi) 
The manner and conduct of the impugned 600th emergent meeting 
of the Board of SNGPL with less than one day notice under a 
vague and generalized agenda infringed various principles of good 
governance under the applicable law and as such the same was 
unlawful being not held in accordance with law.        
 

31 
W. P. No. 12660 of 2023 
 55. 
For reasons recorded as aforesaid, this Petition is allowed in the 
following terms: 
(i) 
The impugned 600th emergent meeting of the Board of SNGPL and all 
the impugned decisions taken therein are declared unlawful, illegal, void 
ab initio, of no legal effect and are accordingly set aside. All related and 
subsequent developments and acts of the Board emanating or arising from 
any act or decision taken in the 600th emergent meeting of the Board of 
SNGPL are also set aside. Consequently, the incumbent CEO is directed 
to forthwith assume his office with full powers as were immediately held 
by him before the date and time of the 600th emergent meeting of the 
Board of SNGPL;  
(ii) 
Fresh meeting of the Board of SNGPL shall be convened, expeditiously,

impugned meeting of the Board and necessary decisions may be taken 
strictly in accordance with law in the light of observations contained in 
this Judgement; 
(iii) 
The fresh meeting of the Board shall include the specific agenda for 
initiation of inquiry or removal of the CEO and the Board may proceed in 
accordance with law; and 
(iv) 
The connected contempt proceedings inter se the parties have been 
dropped for the time being in order to provide an opportunity to the 
incumbent CEO, members of the Board and all other concerned persons 
to act in accordance with law in the light of this Judgment. However, any 
willful deviation or deliberate disobedience of this Judgment by any 
person shall confer the right to any aggrieved person to initiate fresh 
contempt proceedings and in that event, all facts from the date of holding 
of impugned meeting of the Board can be brought under scrutiny.  
(v) 
Order, accordingly.
