Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – The Petitioner is the ex-Prime 
Minister of Pakistan and the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, one of the 
country‟s major political parties. He is currently facing various criminal cases 
regarding corruption and abetting terrorism (attacks on military installations 
and other public property).

On 9.5.2023, the NAB authorities arrested the Petitioner in 
connection with the Al-Qadir Trust case1 from the premises of the Islamabad 
High Court, even though he had already applied for pre-arrest bail. The 
Petitioner challenged his arrest, which the Supreme Court of Pakistan declared 
unlawful by an order dated 11.5.2023 in Crl. Misc. Application No.641/2023, 
and directed his release. 
3. 
 
The Petitioner continued to contest the cases against him, 
including the Al-Qadir Trust case, and managed to avoid arrest until his 
conviction in the Toshakhana case,2 upon which he was apprehended on 
5.8.2023. Although the Islamabad High Court suspended his sentence on 
1.4.2024, he remained incarcerated in Central Jail, Adiala, Rawalpindi, due to 
other pending cases. Meanwhile, the trial in a private complaint titled  
“Khawar Farid Maneka v. Imran Khan Niazi etc.”, commonly known as the 
Iddat case, concluded in which the Petitioner and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were 
accused of offences under sections 496, 496B, and 34 of the Pakistan Penal 
Code. The Judicial Magistrate Section-30, Islamabad East, convicted both of 
them on 3.2.2024. However, they were acquitted on appeal by the Sessions 
Court on 13.7.2024. 
4. 
 
After the Petitioner was acquitted in the Iddat case, there were no 
grounds for his continued detention. On 14.7.2024, when he was about to be 
released, the police arrested him in 12 criminal cases registered against him in 
Lahore around 14 months earlier.3 The following day, i.e., 15.7.2024, the

Home Department of the Government of Punjab issued Order No. 
SO(MP)20-7/2023, purportedly under section 21(2) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 
1997 (the “ATA”). The Government directed the Petitioner to appear via video 
link from the Adiala Jail before the Anti-Terrorism Court-I, Lahore, for 
proceedings related to his physical remand in the aforementioned 12 cases, 
citing concerns for law and order and the Petitioner‟s security. Through this 
petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”), the Petitioner has assailed the vires of 
Order No. SO(MP)20-7/2023 dated 15.7.2024 (the “Impugned Order”). 
5. 
 
Our criminal justice system requires the presence and attendance 
of an accused person at various stages, including pre-trial and during trial. 
Reference in this regard may be inter alia made to sections 167, 241-A, 265-C, 
265-D, 265-E, 342, 344, 353, 361, 363, 498-A, 503, 512, 540-A of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure 1898 (hereinafter referred to as the “Code” or the 
“Cr.P.C.”). The ATA is a special law, and section 32 stipulates that it will have 
effect notwithstanding anything contained in the Code or any other law. The 
present case centers on remand proceedings under the ATA, which the police 
request when an investigation is not completed within twenty-four hours. It 
involves important questions involving the interpretation of the Constitution 
and the ATA. Therefore, by order dated 23.7.2024, this Court issued notice 
under Order XXVII-A CPC to the Attorney General for Pakistan and the 
Advocate General Punjab. 
The submissions 
6. 
 
The Petitioner‟s counsel, Barrister Salman Safdar, contends that, 
firstly, the failure of the police to physically produce the accused before the 
Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC)4 when seeking a remand renders the remand order 
illegal. Ensuring that the accused is brought before the court within twenty-four 
hours of arrest is a critical safeguard against unjustified detention, as 
guaranteed by Articles 9 and 10 of the Constitution. Any law that bypasses it is 
unconstitutional. Secondly, the Impugned Order dated 15.7.2024, issued by the 
Secretary Home Department under section 21(2) of the ATA, is based on a 
misinterpretation of the law. Section 21(2) does not authorize the Government 
                                          
4 Section 32 of the ATA stipulates that for the purposes of the Code an Anti-Terrorism Court shall be deemed 
to be a Court of Session. However, section 21E(3) states that for the purposes of remand the ATC shall be 
deemed to be a magistrate. 

Writ Petition No.45901/2024

to waive the requirement of physically producing the accused at the remand 
hearing; any authority granted under this section pertains only to trial 
proceedings. Thirdly, section 21E(1) of the ATA deals with the issue of the 
remand of individuals arrested under the Act, requiring the physical production 
of the accused before the court within twenty-four hours of arrest. Only then 
can the police seek custody of the accused. The ATA does not allow remand 
proceedings to be conducted via video link or for the physical presence of the 
accused to be waived by any authority. Lastly, the term “Government” in 
section 21(2) of the ATA refers to the Cabinet, not an individual acting on 
behalf of the Provincial Government. For any notification under section 21(2) 
to be valid, it must be authorized by the Cabinet. 
7. 
 
The Assistant Attorney General, Mr. Zain Qazi, submits that 
section 21(2) of the ATA empowers the Government to adopt measures 
necessary to protect judges, the accused, witnesses, prosecutors, defence 
counsel, and anyone involved in court proceedings. He states that the Petitioner 
has been requesting protection since an assassination attempt was made against 
him and has even filed petitions in various High Courts to secure this 
protection. The Government issued the Impugned Order to ensure his safety 
and address other security concerns. Therefore, no exception can be taken 
thereto. 
8. 
 
The Assistant Advocate General, Punjab, Mr. Sittar Sahil, 
contends that the Home Department issued the Impugned Order in accordance 
with the law, considering both the Petitioner‟s safety and the public interest. He 
argues that section 21E of the ATA, which deals with remand, should be 
interpreted purposively to meet modern-day requirements. The phrase 
“produce the accused before the court” in section 21E should be broadly 
construed to include virtual presence. He further submits that the ATA, in 
general, and section 21E, in particular, do not prohibit the production of the 
accused through video link for remand. 
9. 
 
The Prosecutor General, Syed Farhad Ali Shah, argues that video 
conferencing represents a significant advancement in science and technology, 
allowing people to see, hear, and communicate with others remotely as if they 
were physically present. Therefore, video links and video conferences in court 
proceedings and for recording witness testimony are becoming increasingly 

Writ Petition No.45901/2024

common worldwide. The Prosecutor General highlights that Pakistan‟s 
Parliament has also incorporated provisions in various laws to facilitate the use 
of modern technology. For instance, Article 164 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat 
Order, 1984, allows courts, depending on the nature of the case and 
circumstances, to admit evidence or witness testimony recorded through 
modern devices or techniques such as video calls, Viber, Skype, IMO, 
WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Line, and video conferencing.5 Clause (iii) of 
section 30B(1) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (PECA), 
mandates that the Federal and Provincial Governments establish a victim and 
witness protection system through rules with features that should, inter alia, 
include recording testimonies through video-conferencing, audio-video links, 
and the use of modern devices. Section 30C(2) of PECA allows the court to 
hold trials through video links. Likewise, section 12(3) of the Juvenile Justice 
System Act, 2018, empowers the Juvenile Court to waive the physical presence 
of the juvenile and permit participation in court proceedings via an audio-
visual technology link. Provincial legislatures are also making similar strides; 
for example, section 10 of the Punjab Witness Protection Act, 2018, provides 
for the recording of witness evidence through video links. 
10. 
 
The Prosecutor General submits that our courts have increasingly 
endorsed the use of video links in various cases and has cited the following 
precedents in this regard: Salman Akram Raja and another v. Government of 
Punjab and others (2013 SCMR 203), Khawaja Anwer Majid v. National 
Accountability Bureau and another (PLD 2020 SC 635), Ali Haider alias 
Papu v. Jameel Hussain and others (PLD 2021 SC 362), Mian Muhammad 
Nawaz Sharif v. The State and another (PLD 2018 Islamabad 148), Munawar 
Hussain and another v. The State (2020 PCr.LJ 1184), and Muhammad Israr 
v. The State and another (PLD 2021 Peshawar 105). The Prosecutor General 
also referred to Meera Shafi v. Ali Zafar (PLD 2023 SC 211), a case arising 
from civil proceedings. 
                                          
5 Section 164 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order was amended by Act XXXVII of 2023. Before amendment, it 
read as follows: 
164. Production of evidence that has become available because of modern devices, etc. – In such 
cases as the Court may consider appropriate, the Court may allow to be produced any evidence that 
may have become available because of modern devices or techniques. 
Provided that conviction on the basis of modern devices or techniques may be lawful.

The Prosecutor General contends that section 21 of the ATA 
reflects the Government‟s commitment to integrating technology into court 
processes, including the provision for recording evidence via video link. He 
argues that producing an accused before the ATC for remand through a video 
link is equivalent to physical production. Hence, the Impugned Order should 
not be subject to objection. 
Opinion 
12. 
 
International law requires that an arrested person be promptly 
brought before a court following his arrest. The International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) explicitly addresses this issue in Article 
9(3).6 The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) upholds this 
principle in Article 5(3). The American Convention on Human Rights and the 
African Charter on Human and Peoples‟ Rights include similar provisions. 
13. 
 
The U.N. Human Rights Committee, which provides an 
authoritative interpretation of Article 9 of the ICCPR, emphasizes in its 
General Comment No.35 that immediate judicial oversight following an arrest 
is essential for protecting individuals from unlawful and arbitrary detention and 
ensuring their rights to a fair trial and due process. The Committee interprets 
the term “promptly” to generally mean within 48 hours, except in extraordinary 
situations. This period allows for adequate time to ensure procedural 
safeguards while minimizing the risk of prolonged detention without judicial 
oversight. The Committee also stresses that this judicial review must be 
meaningful. The judge must consider whether the detention is legally correct, 
assess whether it is necessary and proportionate, and determine whether there 
are alternatives to incarceration, such as granting bail. The Committee 
underscores that the above requirements apply to all individuals arrested or 
detained on criminal charges, including those held under administrative or pre-
trial detention regimes. 
14. 
 
General Comment No. 35 makes the physical presence of the 
detainee/accused before a judicial authority mandatory. The relevant excerpt 
from paragraph 34 is reproduced below: 
                                          
6 Article 9(3) states: “Anyone arrested or detained on a criminal charge shall be brought promptly before a 
judge or other officer authorized by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a 
reasonable time or to release.” 

Writ Petition No.45901/2024

“The individual must be brought to appear physically before the judge or 
other officer authorized by law to exercise judicial power. The physical 
presence of detainees at the hearing gives the opportunity for inquiry into the 
treatment that they received in custody and facilitates immediate transfer to a 
remand detention centre if continued detention is ordered. It thus serves as a 
safeguard for the right to security of person and the prohibition against 
torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.” 
15. 
 
It is, however, pertinent to note that the General Comment has not 
explicitly addressed the issue of whether video links can be used for remand 
hearings. The omission of specific guidance on video link remand creates 
ambiguity, leaving national legal systems to navigate this issue independently.  
16. 
 
To uphold the principles of the ICCPR, careful consideration and 
stringent safeguards are necessary when incorporating video link technology 
into judicial processes. Firstly, there must be a clear legal framework 
governing the use of video links, outlining the conditions under which they can 
be used and providing safeguards to protect the fair trial rights of the detainee. 
Secondly, the detainee must be able to participate fully in the proceedings, 
meaning they must hear and be heard clearly, see and be seen, and 
communicate confidentially with their legal counsel. Thirdly, the judge must be 
able to adequately assess the detention conditions and the detainee‟s well-
being, ensuring that they are not subjected to coercion or ill-treatment. Finally, 
the decision to use a video link should be made on a case-by-case basis, 
considering the specific circumstances. In other words, video links should be 
an option, not an automatic replacement. Strong justification is required if the 
detainee does not consent, such as exceptional public health concerns, 
logistical challenges, or security issues. 
17. 
 
Article 10 of the Constitution of Pakistan (1973) outlines 
safeguards regarding arrest and detention. Clause (2) thereof provides: 
(2) 
Every person who is arrested and detained in custody shall be 
produced before a magistrate within a period of twenty-four hours of such 
arrest, excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to 
the court of the nearest magistrate, and no such person shall be detained in 
custody beyond the said period without the authority of a magistrate. 
18. 
 
It is a fundamental legal principle that when a law‟s wording is 
clear and perspicuous, courts must apply it as written because it is presumed 
that the text reflects the legislature‟s intent. In such instances, there is no need 
to go beyond the text. S.M. Zafar explains: 

Writ Petition No.45901/2024

“A statute is not open to construction as a matter of course. It is open only 
where the language used in the statute requires interpretation, that is, where 
the statute is ambiguous or will bear two or more constructions or is of such 
doubtful or obscure meaning that reasonable minds might be uncertain or 
disagree as to its meaning. Where the language of the statute is plain and 
ambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, there is no occasion 
for resorting to the rules of statutory interpretation, and the court has no right 
to look for or impose another meaning. Such intention can be gathered only 
from the words actually used in the statute, and in a court of law, what is 
unexpressed has the same value as what was intended … A plain and 
unambiguous statute is to be applied, and not interpreted, since such a statute 
speaks for itself, and any attempt to make it clear is a vain labour and tends 
only to obscurity.”7 
19. 
 
In McCowan v. Baine, [1891] AC 401, p.409, Lord Watson 
stated: 
“It is said that, for some reason, the primary and natural meaning of the 
words is to be extended … I am at a great loss to see why I think an Act of 
Parliament, an agreement, or other authoritative document, ought never to be 
dealt with in this way, unless for a cause amounting to a necessity or 
approaching to it. It is to be remembered that the authors of the document 
could always have put in necessary words if they had thought fit. If they did 
not, it was either because they thought of the matter and did not or because 
they did not think of the matter. In neither case ought the court to do it. In the 
first case, it would be to make provisions opposed to the intention of the 
framers of the document; in the other case, to make a provision not in 
contemplation of these framers.” 
20. 
 
In M/s Hiralal Ratan Lal v. The Sales Tax Officer and another 
(AIR 1973 SC 1034), the Supreme Court of India (SCI) observed: 
“In construing a statutory provision, the first and the foremost rule of 
construction is the literal construction. All that the court has to see at the very 
outset is what does that provision say. If the provision is unambiguous and if 
from that provision the legislative intent is clear, the court need not call into 
aid the other rules of construction of statutes. The other rules of construction 
of statutes are called into aid only when the legislative intention is not clear.” 
21. 
 
In B. Premanand and others vs. Mohan Koikal and others 
(AIR 2011 SC 1925), the SCI held: 
“Where the words of a statute are absolutely clear and unambiguous, recourse 
cannot be had to the principles of interpretation other than the literal rule … 
The language employed in a statute is the determinative factor of the 
legislative intent. The legislature is presumed to have made no mistake. The 
presumption is that it intended to say what it has said. Assuming there is a 
defect or an omission in the words used by the legislature, the court cannot 
correct or make up the deficiency … Where the legislative intent is clear 
from the language, the court should give effect to it … and the court should 
not seek to amend the law in the garb of interpretation.”

In 
Abdul 
Nafey 
v. 
Muhammad 
Rafique 
and 
others  
(2023 SCMR 2096), the Supreme Court of Pakistan held: 
“It is settled law that when meaning of a statute is clear and plain language of 
statute requires no other interpretation, then intention of Legislature 
conveyed through such language has to be given full effect. Plain words must 
be expounded in their natural and ordinary sense. Intention of the Legislature 
is primarily to be gathered from language used and attention has to be paid to 
what has been said and not to that what has not been said.”8 
23. 
 
In Dawood Abdul Ghafoor v. Justice of Peace and others  
(2021 PCr.LJ 1527), it was held that the literal rule of interpretation is nearly 
“biblical” when interpreting a statute. The other rules, i.e., purposive, 
teleological, or mischief rule, can only be resorted to when no intelligible result 
can be arrived at from a literal reading.  
24. 
 
Article 10(2) of the Constitution safeguards the fundamental right 
of an arrested person to be brought before a magistrate within twenty-four 
hours. The terms “produced” and “excluding the time necessary for the journey 
from the place of arrest to the nearest magistrate” indicate a requirement for 
physical presence. This provision is vital in ensuring judicial oversight of the 
detention process, protecting the rights of the detainee/accused from the 
moment of arrest.  
25. 
 
The law must be meticulously followed, in both letter and spirit, 
when a person‟s liberty is at risk of being restricted or curtailed.9 However, 
courts may deviate from a literal or strict construction and resort to purposive 
interpretation when the literal meaning leads to an ambiguous, absurd, or 
unjust outcome. The purposive approach focuses on the law‟s underlying 
purpose to ensure it achieves its intended objective. According to Aharon 
Barak, purposive interpretation involves three key elements: language, 
purpose, and discretion.10 The language of the text determines the range of 
semantic possibilities within which the interpreter acts as they choose the legal 
meaning from various explicit or implicit possibilities.11 The purposive 
component is central to interpreting a legal text. It implies “the values, goals, 
                                          
8 The Supreme Court also referred to the following cases in support of this statement of law: Government of 
KPK v. Abdul Manan (2021 SCMR 1871) and JS Bank Limited v. Province of Punjab through Secretary Food, 
Lahore (2021 SCMR 1617). Also see: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through Chief Secretary, Peshawar and others v. 
Intizar Ali and others (2022 SCMR 472).

interests, policies, and aims that the text is designed to actualize”.12 Finally, 
Barak emphasizes that interpretive discretion is indispensable in determining 
the ultimate purpose of the norm: “It is the choice that purposive interpretation 
gives the judge from among a few interpretive possibilities, all of which are 
legal” in order “to formulate the purpose at the core of the text”.13 
26. 
 
At times, courts also interpret explicit constitutional – and 
statutory – provisions purposively to address modern challenges that the 
drafters of the text did not foresee. In Muhammad Aslam Awan v. Federation 
of Pakistan and others (2014 SCMR 1289), the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
noted that the meanings of constitutional words and concepts evolve with time 
and circumstances. In Province of Sindh and others v. MQM and others  
(PLD 2014 SC 531), it stated that “the Constitution of a country is a living 
organism and a particular provision, a term or word has to be interpreted 
dynamically and purposively to achieve the constitutional intent” (para 60). In 
Khurshid Soap and Chemical Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. and others v. Federation 
of Pakistan and others (PLD 2020 SC 641), the Supreme Court emphasized 
that the Constitution is organic and a living testament to the people‟s 
aspirations. The “living tree” doctrine allows the Constitution to change and 
evolve while acknowledging its original intentions, balancing predictability 
and flexibility. A static interpretation would render the Constitution obsolete, 
so interpreters must focus on the originators‟ intended accomplishments rather 
than the literal text alone. Judges must ensure both stability and change, as 
stability without change leads to degeneration, and change without stability 
leads to anarchy. This progressive interpretation preserves the Constitution‟s 
vitality, preventing it from becoming obsolete. The Supreme Court reiterated 
this view in Aam Log Ittehad and another v. The Election Commission of 
Pakistan and others (PLD 2022 SC 39), stating that the Constitution evolves 
and develops not just by way of textual changes (i.e., constitutional 
amendments) but also in a (continually) maturing understanding of the 
constitutional provisions. This means not just the very words of the 
Constitution but also the concepts and aspirations behind them. A well-known 
(and excellent) example of these established principles is the evolving meaning

of “life” in Article 9. As landmark cases such as Shehla Zia and others v. 
WAPDA (PLD 1994 SC 693) demonstrate, this term should be applied 
conceptually and periodically reconsidered as its scope continues to broaden 
and deepen. 
27. 
 
A Constitution occupies a special status in the legal system. It 
plays a role that no other legal text can fill.14 While interpreting a particular 
constitutional provision, the constitutional scheme and the express language 
employed cannot be ignored.15 Aharon Barak writes: 
“Constitutional language – like the language of any legal text – plays a dual 
role. On the one hand, it sets the limits of interpretation. The language of the 
constitution is not clay in the hands of the interpreter, to be molded as he or 
she sees fit. A constitution is neither a metaphor nor a non-binding 
recommendation. On the other hand, the language of the contstitution is a 
source of its purpose. There are other sources, to be sure, but constitutional 
language is an important and highly credible source of information. The fact 
that we may learn the purpose of a constitution sources external to it does not 
mean that we can give a constitution a meaning that is inconsistent with its 
explicit or implicit language. Interpretation cannot create a new constitutional 
text. Talk of judges amending the constitution through their interpretation of 
the constitution is just a metaphor. The claim that a constitutional text limits 
but does not command is true only for the limited number of cases in which, 
after exhausting all interpretive tools, we can still extract more than one legal 
meaning from the constitutional language and must, therefore, leave the final 
decision to judicial discretion. In these exceptional cases, language provides a 
general direction but does not draw a precise map of how to reach the 
destination. Usually, however, constitutional language sets not only the limits 
of interpretation but also its specific content.”16

As adumbrated, Article 10(2) of the Constitution aims to protect 
individuals‟ fundamental rights by ensuring judicial oversight of detention, 
preventing abuse of power, and upholding the principles of justice and the rule 
of law. The requirement for physical production of an accused before a 
magistrate is a crucial deterrent to abuse and enhances the accountability of law 
enforcement agencies. Allowing video link remand in place of physical 
production can undermine these protections, especially in our country where 
custodial torture is a pervasive issue. The impersonal nature of video 
communication may not offer the same level of scrutiny as an in-person 
meeting, potentially leading the magistrate to miss subtle signs of distress, 
coercion, or mistreatment that would be more noticeable face-to-face.

Additionally, technical issues such as poor video quality, delays, or disruptions 
could impair the magistrate‟s ability to provide effective oversight. 
29. 
 
To conclude, the existing language of Article 10(2) of the 
Constitution does not support video link remand hearings. Employing 
purposive interpretation to justify it would contradict both the text and the 
provision‟s intent. This cannot be permitted. 
30. 
 
The Code provides a comprehensive legal framework for the 
administration of criminal justice in the country and applies unless a specific 
procedure is laid down by a special law that overrides it. Section 61 Cr.P.C. 
stipulates that no police officer shall detain a person arrested without a warrant 
for longer than is reasonable under the circumstances, and such detention shall 
not, in the absence of a special order from a magistrate under section 167, 
exceed twenty-four hours, excluding the time required for the journey from the 
place of arrest to the magistrate‟s court. Section 167(1) Cr.P.C. states that 
whenever a person is arrested and detained in custody, and it becomes apparent 
that the investigation cannot be completed within the twenty-four hours period 
fixed by section 61, and there are grounds to believe that the accusation or 
information is well-founded, the officer in-charge of the police station or the 
investigating officer, if he is not below the rank of Sub-Inspector, must 
immediately transmit to the nearest magistrate a copy of the relevant entries in 
the case diary and forward the accused to the magistrate. Section 167(2) states 
that the magistrate to whom the accused is forwarded under this section may, 
whether or not he has jurisdiction to try the case, authorize the detention of the 
accused in such custody as he deems fit for a term not exceeding fifteen days in 
total. If he lacks jurisdiction to try the case or send it for trial and considers 
further detention unnecessary, he may order the accused to be forwarded to a 
magistrate who has such jurisdiction. However, no Magistrate of the Third 
Class, and no Magistrate of the Second Class who is not specially empowered 
by the Provincial Government, shall authorize detention in police custody. 
31. 
 
The Lahore High Court Rules and Orders, Volume III, Chapter 
11, Part B, Rule 7 also mandates that “the accused must always be produced 
before the magistrate when a remand is asked for.” 
32. 
 
The remand under section 167 Cr.P.C. differs from that under 
section 344. Section 167 allows a magistrate, whether or not he has jurisdiction 

Writ Petition No.45901/2024 
 
 
 
- 13 -
to try the case, to remand the accused to either police or judicial custody, 
depending on the judicial determination. Remand to police custody under this 
section is specifically for the purpose of investigation. In contrast, section 344 
applies where, due to the absence of a witness or any other reasonable cause, it 
becomes necessary for the court to postpone the commencement of any inquiry 
or trial. In such instances, the court may, at its discretion, postpone or adjourn 
proceedings and, if the accused is in custody, remand them by warrant. 
However, no magistrate can remand an accused to custody under section 344 
for more than 15 days at a time. Remand under section 344 is strictly to judicial 
custody and can only be to a judicial lock-up. In short, section 167 deals with 
detention during the investigation, while section 344 pertains to detention 
during the inquiry or trial. 
33. 
 
Sections 61 and 167 Cr.P.C. and the High Court Rules echo the 
command of Article 10(2) of the Constitution. In section 167 Cr.P.C.,  
“from the words „the magistrate to whom an accused person is forwarded under 
this section‟, it is clear that the prosecution [is] under a duty to produce the 
accused person before the magistrate not only at the stage of obtaining initial 
remand but also on subsequent occasions having regard to the specific powers 
of the magistrate to authorise detention „from time to time‟. The power to 
authorise detention was only in the event of the police forwarding an accused 
person to the magistrate; if there was no forwarding of the accused person, 
there [is] no authorisation of detention. As the authorisation of detention [is] 
only subsequent to the forwarding of the accused person, it necessarily implies 
that the accused person must be produced every time authorisation for 
detention [is] sought.”17 
34. 
 
Therefore, even when viewed from the statutory perspective, the 
law‟s mandate is that the accused person should be physically produced before 
the magistrate – although it may be somewhat burdensome for the State. In  
Emperor v. Benoari Lal Sarma (AIR 1945 PC 48), the Privy Council observed 
(per Viscount Simonds, L.C.): “Again and again, this Board has insisted that in 
construing enacted words we are not concerned with the policy involved or 
with the results, injurious or otherwise, which may follow from giving effect to 
the language used.” In Government of the Punjab v. Abdur Rehman and 
                                          
17 Kurra Dasaratha Ramaiah and others v. State of Andhra Pradesh (1992 CriLJ 3485)  
(Full Bench, Andhra High Court).

others (2022 SCMR 25), the Supreme Court of Pakistan held that when the 
language of a statute is clear, hardship or inconvenience cannot justify 
modifying or altering its plain meaning.  
35. 
 
Given the above, in Senator Asif Ali Zardari v. State  
(2000 MLD 921), the Supreme Court held that a remand order would be illegal 
if, at the time of its passing, accused was not produced before the court, which 
passed the remand order. In The State v. Nasir Javed Rana (PLD 2005 SC 86), 
the case involved a civil dispute over a property stemming from a power of 
attorney executed in 1966. The Supreme Court noted that the magistrate, 
inappropriately favouring one party, granted physical remand of an accused 
without following legal procedures. He passed the order granting the remand 
without having the accused produced before him and without due application 
of judicial mind. The Supreme Court deemed his actions a deliberate 
misconduct, compromising the court‟s integrity. Considering all these 
circumstances, it declared the magistrate unfit for judicial service, withdrew his 
judicial powers, and referred the matter to the Lahore High Court for further 
action.  
36. 
 
It follows that the physical production of the accused before the 
magistrate for remand is a mandatory requirement. It can be excused only in 
exceptional circumstances, for example, when the accused is critically injured 
or seriously ill and hospitalized. Obviously, the law does not and cannot 
demand the impossible.18  
37. 
 
Section 167 Cr.P.C. is unequivocal in its terms and does not allow 
for the remand of an accused via a video link. We have already pointed out that 
when the wording is explicit, the legislature‟s intent should be understood 
directly from the text, without resorting to interpretative aids. Consequently, 
any attempt to justify video link remand through purposive interpretation 
cannot be upheld. 
38. 
 
We have interpreted Article 10(2) of the Constitution in much the 
same way as above. Since section 167 Cr.P.C. is phrased similarly to Article 
10(2), interpreting it differently would conflict with the Constitution, which is 
impermissible.

39. 
 
At this point, it may be beneficial to consider the legal framework 
in India. Article 22(2) of the Indian Constitution closely parallels Article 10(2) 
of Pakistan‟s Constitution (1973). It also mandates that the accused should be 
produced before the nearest magistrate within twenty-four hours of his arrest if 
he is required to be detained beyond that period.19 The British enacted the Code 
of Criminal Procedure 1898. After the Partition, both Pakistan and India 
adopted it. India later revised and re-enacted the Code in 1973, where section 
61 of the 1898 Code became section 57 in the 1973 Code, retaining similar 
content. Section 167 of the 1898 Code was also carried over with the same 
numbering but was later amended to introduce the concept of first (initial) 
remand after arrest and subsequent remands (or remand extensions).20 Through 
section 167(2) of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure 1973, the Indian 
Parliament effectively allowed video remand without violating Article 22(2) of 
the Indian Constitution, though only to a limited extent. Various High Courts 
in India have established rules to regulate video link remand hearings to 
implement this amendment fully.21 The Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 
2023, the new law that replaces the 1973 Code, contains similar provisions 
under section 187. 
40. 
 
We concur with the Prosecutor General that our Parliament and 
courts have allowed the use of video link technology in judicial processes. 
However, no existing statute explicitly permits remand hearings via video link. 
Even section 21(2) of the ATA, which he cited, pertains only to trial 
procedures. The judgments referenced are also not applicable, as they do not 
address the specific issue under consideration. In Salman Akram Raja and 
another v. Government of Punjab and others (2013 SCMR 203), the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan directed that in appropriate cases, evidence of rape victims 
                                          
19 Article 22(2) of the Constitution of India is reproduced below for ease of reference: 
 
(2) Every person who is arrested and detained in custody shall be produced before the nearest 
magistrate within a period of twenty-four hours of such arrest excluding the time necessary for the 
journey from the place of arrest to the court of the magistrate and no such person shall be detained in 
custody beyond the said period without the authority of a magistrate. 
20 Proviso (b) to section 167(2) of India‟s Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 provided: 
 
(b) no magistrate shall authorise detention of the accused in custody of the police under this section 
unless the accused is produced before him in person for the first time and subsequently every time till 
the accused remains in the custody of the police, but the magistrate may extend further detention in 
judicial custody on production of the accused either in person or through the medium of electronic 
video linkage;

should be recorded through video conferencing so that the victims, particularly 
the juvenile, may not have to come to the court. In Khawaja Anwer Majid v. 
National Accountability Bureau and another (PLD 2020 SC 635), the 
accused was bedridden with serious health problems. The Supreme Court 
granted him post-arrest bail on medical grounds inter alia subject to the 
condition that he would join the investigation as and when required by the 
NAB and ensure his representation before the Accountability Court either 
personally or through video link. In Ali Haider alias Papu v. Jameel Hussain 
and others (PLD 2021 SC 362), the Supreme Court explained the importance 
of modern forensic techniques and science in the criminal justice system. In

and 
another  
(PLD 2018 Islamabad 148), the issue related to recording the testimony of two 
witnesses residing in the United Kingdom through video link. In Munawar 
Hussain and another v. The State (2020 PCr.LJ 1184), this Court allowed the 
recording of a compromise statement of legal heirs of the deceased through a 
video link. Similarly, in Muhammad Israr v. The State and another  
(PLD 2021 Peshawar 105), the Peshawar High Court permitted the recording 
of a prosecution witness through a video link. In Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi v. 
Federation of Pakistan etc. (Writ Petition No.839/2023),22 the writ petitioner 
was facing multiple inquiries/ investigations, and criminal cases in Islamabad 
and other parts of the country. He requested that the High Court direct the State 
to facilitate his participation and appearance via video link. Although the court 
discussed section 167 Cr.P.C., it did not address the issue of physical remand 
through video link, as it was not relevant to the case. The court acknowledged 
the purposive approach, affirming that physical presence can be waived in 
certain circumstances. However, it emphasized that this approach must not 
overlook the statutory framework and the fundamental principles of the 
criminal justice system. The court ruled that the physical presence of the 
accused cannot be dispensed with in specific situations, such as at the time of 
admission (first hearing) and final adjudication of the pre-arrest bail

The case Meera Shafi v. Ali Zafar (PLD 2023 SC 211) pertains to 
civil proceedings. It concerns the evidence of a witness, specifically focusing 
on the interpretation of the word “attendance” used in Rule 4 of Order XVIII 
CPC. The Supreme Court held that the word “attendance” in Rule 4 can be 
extended to include “virtual attendance” and that it does not refer solely to 
“physical attendance” but also encompasses “virtual attendance” made possible 
by modern video conferencing technology.

Remand under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 
43. 
 
The Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 (“ATA”) is a special law for 
preventing terrorism and sectarian violence and for the speedy trial of heinous 
offences.24 Section 21E of the ATA deals with the issue of remand. Since it is 
central to the case, we reproduce it below in extenso for ease of reference: 
21E. Remand.– (1) Where a person is detained for investigation, the 
Investigating Officer, within twenty-four hours of the arrest, excluding the 
time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the Court, shall 
produce the accused before the Court, and may apply for remand of the 
accused to police custody, or custody of any other investigating agency 
joined in the investigation for which the maximum period allowed may be 
not less than fifteen days and not more than thirty days at one time: 
  
Provided that, where an accused cannot within twenty-four hours be 
produced before the Court, a temporary order for police custody or custody of 
any other investigating agency joined in the investigation not exceeding 
twenty-four hours may be obtained from the nearest Magistrate for the 
purpose of producing the accused before the Court within that period. 
                                          
23 In this case, the Islamabad High Court held that while the physical presence of the accused is “absolutely 
necessary” at the time of admission or the initial order of ad-interim bail before arrest, for subsequent 
proceedings – excluding final adjudication – the presence of the accused may be marked through video link, 
but only if the court permits it. The court should ensure  that video link attendance is not used as a tactic to 
delay the proceedings.  
In Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi v. Special Judge, ATC., etc. (PLD 2024 Lahore 486), the Special Judge, 
Anti-Terrorism Court, granted the accused ad-interim pre-arrest bail. However, during the pendency of this 
bail, the accused was convicted and sentenced in another case by the Additional Sessions Judge, Islamabad 
(West), and was subsequently taken into custody and imprisoned. This fact was brought to the Special Judge‟s 
attention through a written application with a request for exemption from personal attendance. The Special 
Judge declined the request dismissed the pre-arrest bail application due to the accused‟s non-appearance/non-
prosecution. A Division Bench of this Court ruled that the Special Judge should have exempted the accused 
from personal attendance on the relevant date and allowed him to appear via video link. The Division Bench 
based its decision on the precedent set in Farhan Masood Khan v. The State [PLJ 2021 Cr.C. (Lahore) 550].

(2) 
No expansion of the time of the remand of the accused in police 
custody or custody of any other investigating agency joined in the 
investigation shall be allowed, unless it can be shown by the Investigating 
Officer, to the satisfaction of the Court that further evidence may be available 
and the Court is satisfied that no bodily harm has been or will be caused to 
the accused: 
  
Provided that the total period of such remand shall not exceed ninety 
days. 
(3) 
The Court shall be deemed to be a Magistrate for purposes of sub-
section (1): 
  
Provided that …  
44. 
 
The ATA, enacted in 1997, has undergone several amendments 
over time. Section 21 of the Act was substituted/re-enacted, and section 21E 
was introduced through Ordinance XXXIX of 2001.25 Section 21 allows the 
Anti-Terrorism Court to conduct trials on jail premises or through video links. 
However, section 21E, which specifically addresses the issue of remand, does 
not include any provisions for video link usage. It is completely silent on this 
matter. This suggests that video links are intended to be limited solely to trial 
proceedings. A general rule of construction of the Acts of Parliament is 
expressio unius est exclusio alterius (the express mention of one thing implies 
the exclusion of another). In Blackburn v. Flavelle [1881] 6 App Cas 628, the 
Act referred to two modes of sale: a conditional sale and a sale by auction. 
Section 18 of the Act expressly authorized a sale by auction. The Privy Council 
held that it excluded the right of conditional sale. “If there be any one rule of 
law clearer than another as to the construction of all statutes and all written 
instruments (as, for example, sales under powers in deeds and wills) in this: 
that where the legislature or the parties to an instrument have expressly 
authorized one or more particular modes of sale or dealing with property, such 
expressions always exclude any other mode, except as specifically authorized.” 
45. 
 
When interpreting statutes, it is presumed that the legislature 
chooses its words carefully. Therefore, if a word or phrase is included, it is not 
considered redundant; similarly, if a word or phrase is omitted, such omission 
is not deemed inconsequential. A change in language implies a change in 
intent.26 Courts are not empowered to read into or delete any words or 
provisions in an enactment unless specifically adopted or imported by 
reference. They do not legislate but interpret statutes according to their plain

and ordinary meaning, without importing or borrowing provisions from other 
laws, no matter how desirable such modifications may seem.27 In section 21E 
of the ATA, the legislature deliberately chose not to allow video link remand. 
In Mullins v Collins [(1874) L.R. 9 Q.B. 292, 295], a man was prosecuted 
because his servant supplied a constable on duty with a drink. Section 16 of the 
Licensing Act 1872 consisted of a series of clauses headed “Offences against 
Public Order.” The section contained three sub-sections, the first of which 
defined offences which must be “knowingly” committed; the other two sub-
sections omitted the word “knowingly”. It was held to be no defence on the 
accused‟s part that his servant had done this without his knowledge.  
“The appellant,” said Archibald J., “has been convicted under the second sub-
section, where the word „knowingly‟ is omitted. This seems to point to the 
conclusion that the licensed victualler will be liable for the act of his servant 
although he himself has not knowingly committed an offence against the 
second sub-section.”  
46. 
 
The offences under the ATA are the most heinous, and the 
perpetrators are dangerous criminals – or at least they are presumed to be so. 
Still, they have fundamental rights. Being hazardous criminals, they are more 
prone to custodial torture by the police than other criminals. The legislature has 
designedly chosen not to allow video link remand because it wanted to secure 
their fundamental rights more effectively. 
47. 
 
Lastly, since the wording of section 21E of the ATA closely 
mirrors that of Article 10(2) of the Constitution and sections 61 and 167 
Cr.P.C., there is no reason for us to interpret it differently from our 
interpretation of those provisions. 
48. 
 
Earlier in this judgment, we observed that the existing language of 
Article 10(2) of the Constitution does not endorse remand hearings via video 
link. If Parliament decides to amend section 21E of the ATA and introduce 
changes similar to those India made to section 167 of the Indian Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1973, it would be necessary for this Court to frame rules 
under section 554 Cr.P.C. to safeguard the rights of the accused and ensure 
adherence to the principles of the ICCPR. At present, no such rules exist.

Given the above, we hold that the use of video links is restricted to 
the trial. For remand, the investigating agency must produce the accused 
person physically before the court.  
The Impugned Order 
50. 
 
The Home Department has issued the Impugned Order dated 
15.7.2024, purportedly under section 21(2) of the ATA, which reads as 
follows: 
(2) 
For purposes of protection of the judges, accused, witnesses, 
prosecutors and defence counsel and anyone concerned with the Court 
proceedings, the Government may adopt such other measures as may be 
appropriate or may be prescribed and the Armed Forces shall also provide 
comprehensive protection and security to the judges, members, accused, 
witnesses, prosecutors, investigators, defence counsel and all those concerned 
in the Court proceedings. These measures may include the following 
namely:–  
(a) 
screens may be used during trial to shield witnesses, Judges and 
Prosecutors from public view; 
(b) 
trial may be held in jail premises or through video link; 
(c) 
witness protection programmes may be established by the 
Government through law or rules. 
The Provincial Government shall take necessary steps to ensure that 
prisoners in jails do not have access to mobile phones. 
51. 
 
It should be appreciated that section 21E of the ATA is a special 
provision that specifically addresses the issue of remand. In contrast, section 
21(2) is a general provision that enables the Government to take necessary 
steps to protect judges, accused individuals, witnesses, prosecutors, defence 
counsel, and others involved in court proceedings. Section 21(2) cannot 
override section 21E and should not be interpreted in a way that nullifies or 
undermines it. Consequently, the Impugned Order dated 15.07.2024 is  
ultra vires, illegal, and void. The reliance on and interpretation of section 21(2) 
of the ATA to justify the physical remand of the Petitioner without physical 
production is erroneous. Section 21(2) does not grant the Government any 
authority over remand proceedings, as its scope is limited to matters related to 
trial proceedings. 
52. 
 
Finally, the term “Government” in section 21(2) of the ATA refers 
to the Cabinet, not an individual executive acting on behalf of the Provincial 
Government. For any notification issued under this provision to be valid, it 
must first be authorized by the Cabinet in a formal meeting or by circulation in 
accordance with the Rules of Business. It is deemed illegal without such

authorization, per the law enunciated by the Supreme Court in Mustafa Impex 
v. Government of Pakistan (PLD 2016 SC 808). Since the Impugned Order 
was issued by the Secretary of the Home Department, Government of the 
Punjab, without the requisite Cabinet approval, it is void. 
53. 
 
We accepted this petition and quashed the Impugned Order 
through a short order dated 25.7.2024. These are the reasons for our decision.
