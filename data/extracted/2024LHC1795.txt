MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J. / CHAIRMAN:- 
Through instant appeal, the vires of orders / letters dated 
11.12.2021 and 19.01.2022, passed by respondent, have been 
assailed, whereby representations of appellant for treating the 
intervening period from the date of dismissal to the date of 
reinstatement into service as on duty and grant of back benefits 
were declined.  
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that appellant was dismissed from 
service vide Notification dated 28.05.2012. He assailed said 
notification through Service Appeal No.11 of 2012, which was 
accepted vide judgment dated 16.01.2015, afore-said Notification 
was set aside, and appellant was reinstated into service with 
immediate effect vide notification dated 27.03.2015. Appellant 
filed Service Appeal No. 13 of 2015, which was allowed vide 
judgment dated 03.11.2017. Consequently, vide Notification dated 
02.04.2019, appellant was reinstated into service from the date of 
his dismissal. Subsequently, appellant moved representations for 
grant of back benefits while treating the intervening period as 
period spent on duty, but the same were declined vide impugned 
orders / letters dated 11.12.2021 and 19.01.2022, passed by 
respondent. Hence, instant appeal.  
3. 
Learned counsel for appellant submits that appellant had 
been reinstated into service from the date of his dismissal,

Service Appeal No. 03 of 2022 
therefore, intervening period is required to be declared as spent on 
duty. He further submits that appellant did not remain gainfully 
employed during the intervening period, therefore, there was no 
justification to deny back benefits. He contends that similarly 
placed colleagues of appellant were awarded back benefits but 
appellant was subjected to gross discrimination in the matter. In 
support, he has placed reliance on Muhammad Sharif and others v. 
Inspector General of Punjab, Police, Lahore and others (2021 
SCMR 962).  
4. 
On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent submits 
that appeal, being barred by time, is liable to be dismissed. Adds 
that the authority is not bound to assign reasons and it is 
discretionary power of authority to grant back benefits. Further 
submits that representations of appellant were declined in 
accordance with law.  
5. 
Heard. Available record perused. 
6. 
Undeniably, appellant had been reinstated into service from 
the date of his dismissal, however the authority did not pass any 
order regarding intervening period and consequent benefits. The 
stance of appellant is that he was not employed for gain during the 
intervening period, rather his request to practice as an Advocate 
was also declined by the authority, therefore, he is entitled for 
grant of back benefits.  
7. 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan, in a number of 
pronouncements, has categorically declared that back benefits shall 
be granted for the intervening period, during which an employee 
remained out of service and did not engage in any gainful 
profession. The concept of reinstatement into service with 
original seniority and back benefits is based on the established 
principle of jurisprudence that if an illegal action / wrong is 
struck down by the Court, as a consequence, it is also to be 
ensured that no undue harm is caused to any individual due to 
such illegality / wrong or as a result of delay in the redress of his 
grievance. If by virtue of a declaration given by the Court a civil 
servant is to be treated as being still in service, he should also be

Service Appeal No. 03 of 2022 
given the consequential relief of the back benefits (including 
salary) for the period he was kept out of service as if he was 
actually performing duties. The grant of back benefits, in such 
situation, is a rule and denial of such benefit is an exception on 
the proof that such a person had remained gainfully employed 
during the intervening period. Reliance is placed upon Pakistan 
through General Manager, P.W.R., Lahore v. Mrs. A.V. Issacs 
(PLD 1970 Supreme Court 415), Inspector General of Police, 
Punjab v. Tariq Mahmood (2015 SCMR 77) and Muhammad 
Sharif and others v. Inspector General of Police, Punjab, Lahore 
and others (2021 SCMR 962).  
8. 
The appellant has specifically pleaded that other similarly 
placed judicial officers were granted service / financial back 
benefits (copies of such notifications are available at Page Nos. 
186 to 196 of this appeal), however he has been subjected to gross 
discrimination in the matter, which is in violation of equality 
clause contained in Article 25 of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973.  
 
This stance of appellant could not be rebutted by learned 
counsel for respondent, despite arguing the case at some length. 
9. 
As the appellant’s claim of back benefits is found to be valid 
and his entitlement has been established, the impediment of 
limitation cannot be allowed to come in his way, in view of dictum 
laid down by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in case reported as 
Abdul Hameed and others v. Water and Power Development 
Authority through Chairman, Lahore and others (2021 SCMR 
1230).  
10. 
In view of above discussion, instant appeal is allowed and 
respondent is directed to calculate the financial back benefits of 
appellant in the light of case law referred supra.
