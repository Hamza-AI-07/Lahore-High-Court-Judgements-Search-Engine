Sardar Abdul Basit Khan, Advocate for Muhammad 
Imran accused/respondent produced by Fiaz Hussain 
and Zia Sub-Inspectors.  
 
This is an appeal filed by the State against the acquittal of 
Muhammad Imran accused/respondent vide judgment dated 10.08.2019 
passed under section 265-K Cr.P.C. by Additional Sessions Judge/CNSA 
Court/MCTC, Sadiq Abad in case FIR No. 333/2019 dated 19.06.2019 
under section 9-C of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, Police 
Station Bhong, Sadiq Abad, District Rahim Yar Khan. Though this appeal 
was admitted for regular hearing vide order dated 06.04.2021, yet 
limitation being question of law is required to be attended first; as per 
application under section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1908, State has prayed 
for condonation of delay in filing of appeal.  
2. 
The learned Deputy Prosecutor General submits that the question of 
law involved in this appeal is also the subject matter of some other 
appeals pending before this Court which were filed within the period of 
limitation; he while relying on cases reported as “COLLECTOR OF 
CUSTOMS, CUSTOMS HOUSE, LAHORE and another Versus Messrs 
WASIM RADIO TRADERS, LAHORE and others” (2023 SCMR 1716); 
“GOVERNMENT OF BALOCHISTAN through Chief Secretary Quetta and 
others versus Dr. MUHAMMAD TARIQ JAFAR and others” (2020 SCMR 
1689) states that when an identical question of law is involved in appeals 
filed within time and the time barred then the delay must be condoned in 
the interest of justice. Further submits that there is cumbersome process 
for obtaining sanction from the government to file an appeal which takes a 
longer time, therefore, State may be given preferential right in 
condonation of delay. He continued on submitting that limitation does not 
run against a void order and the judgment of the learned lower court is

Criminal Appeal No.275 of 2020.  
bereft of legal recognition; finally argued that period of limitation for 
State to file appeal against acquittal is six months in view of Article 157 
of the Limitation Act. 
3. 
Heard. 
4. 
We have examined the judgment reported as “COLLECTOR OF 
CUSTOMS, CUSTOMS HOUSE, LAHORE and another Versus Messrs 
WASIM RADIO TRADERS, LAHORE and others” (2023 SCMR 1716) 
wherein importers have challenged the Valuation Ruling issued by 
Customs department under section 25A of the Customs Act, 1969 
affecting all the importers alike; similarly in case reported as 
“GOVERNMENT OF BALOCHISTAN through Chief Secretary Quetta and 
others versus Dr. MUHAMMAD TARIQ JAFAR and others” (2020 SCMR 
1689), Supreme Court of Pakistan condoned the delay only on the ground 
that three appeals were preferred against the same judgment out of which 
two were time barred, but here before this Court appeals against acquittals  
in different judgments are pending, therefore, the case law referred by the 
learned law officer has no relevance on the matter before us. 
5. 
The contention of learned DPG that limitation does not run against 
a void order is repelled because it is now settled that law of limitation 
being lex fori creates a right in favour of the parties, therefore, cannot be 
ignored by treating it mere a technicality. A fourteen members’ judgment 
reported as “Gen. (R.) PARVEZ MUSHARRAF v. NADEEM AHMED 
(Advocate) and another” (PLD 2014 SC 585) confirmed the view that 
limitation would run even against a void order, therefore, we are not 
required to look into the contours of impugned judgment of learned trial 
Court. The above judgment of Supreme Court of Pakistan was later 
followed by the Court in different cases reported as “KIRAMAT KHAN 
versus IG, FRONTIER CORPS and others” (2023 SCMR 866), “CHIEF 
ENGINEER, GUJRANWALA ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY GEPCO), 
GUJRANWALA versus KHAID MEHMOOD and others” (2023 SCMR 291), 
“MUHAMMAD SHARIF and others versus MCB BANK LIMITED and others” 
(2021 SCMR 1158), “Haji WAJDAD Versus PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT

Criminal Appeal No.275 of 2020.  
through Secretary Board of Revenue Government of Baluchistan, Quetta and 
others” (2020 SCMR 2046), “GHULAM HUSSAIN RAMZAN ALI Versus 
COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS (PREVENTIVE), KARACHI” (2014 SCMR 
1594) and “Messrs BLUE STAR SPINNING MILLS LTD Versus COLLECTOR 
OF SALES TAX and others” (2013 SCMR 587). 
6. 
It was claimed that period of limitation for filing of appeal against 
acquittal by the State is six months as per Article 157 of the Limitation 
Act. We have examined that this appeal against acquittal is not being 
regulated under section 417 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1897, rather 
was filed under section 48 of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 
1997 which is a special law and is to be read for period of limitation 
provided therein. Other side has referred the case reported as “The STATE 
Versus SAID RAHEEM and others” (PLD 2016 Lahore 560) that the 
limitation for filing an appeal under section 48 of the Control of Narcotic 
Substances Act, 1997 is 30 days and special law prevails over the 
provisions of general law; therefore, Article 157 of the Limitation Act 
shall not apply. We have attended this contention but found that no period 
of limitation is mentioned for filing of appeal under section 48 of the 
Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997; therefore, while relying on 
case reported as “ALLAH DINO and another versus MUHAMMAD SHAH and 
others” (2001 SCMR 286), wherein it was held that any law which does 
not contain any period of limitation the whole Limitation Act shall be 
applicable upon it; therefore, subject to section 29 of the Limitation Act, it 
can safely be held that Article 157 of the Limitation Act would well be 
available to the State for filing of appeal against acquittal; but we have 
examined that even the appeal has been filed beyond the period of 
limitation of six months, which is time barred by 13 days and we cannot 
condone it under section 5 of the limitation Act which is  not available for 
proceedings under special law. This has also been explained in the above 
judgment (2001 SCMR 286) that pursuant to section 29 (2) of the 
Limitation Act, Section 5 of the said Act shall not be applicable to special 
law. To further thrash this legal provision, we have read section 29 of the 
Limitation Act in toto, which is reproduced as under: - 

 
4 
Criminal Appeal No.275 of 2020.  
“29. Savings. --- (1) Nothing in this Act shall affect section 25 of the Contract 
Act, 1872.  
(2) Where any special or local law prescribes for any suit, appeal or application 
a period of limitation different from the period prescribed therefor by the First 
Schedule, the provisions of section 3 shall apply, as if such period were 
prescribed therefor in that Schedule, and for the purpose of determining any 
period of limitation prescribed for any suit, appeal or application by any 
special or local law. 
(a)  
the provisions contained in section 4, sections 9 to 18, and 
section 22 shall apply only in so far as, and to the extent to 
which, they are not expressly excluded by such special or local 
law; and  
(b)  
the remaining provisions of the Act shall not apply.” 
The above section makes it clear that in a special law application of 
Sections 4, 9 to 18 and 22 shall ipso facto apply if they are not specifically 
excluded from that law, whereas, as per clause (b) above the remaining 
sections of the Act shall not be applicable in any manner, which obviously 
includes Section 5 of the Act, therefore, this Court has no jurisdiction to 
invoke section 5 of the Limitation Act for condoning delay in any appeal 
against acquittal filed under the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997. 
Reliance in this respect is further placed on the cases reported as 
“SHEHZD ALI SHAH versus SPECIAL JUDGE RENT, LAHORE and others” 
(PLD 2020 Lahore 354), “Messrs SPIRIT INDUSTRIES (PRIVATE) 
LIMITED through authorize representative Versus NASTGIONAL TARRIF 
COMMISSION, ISLAMABAD and 2 others” (2021 PTD 647), “STATE (NAB) 
versus MUHAMMAD ASLAM BAJWA and others” (2016 P Cr. L J 1189), 
and “ASMAT versus SAHIB ROKHAN and 7 others” (PLD 2023 Peshawar 
64). 
7. 
The argument of learned Deputy Prosecutor General for treating the 
State somewhat preferentially in the matters about condonation of delay, 
finds the answer in the case reported as “GOVERNMENT OF THE 
PUNJAB versus MUHAMMAD SALEEM” (PLD 1995 SC 396) where the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan while holding that delay of each and every day 
is to be explained, also held that the Government cannot be treated 
differently than a private litigant on the question of limitation under 
section 5 of the Limitation Act. Similarly, delay in obtaining sanction 
from government is also no ground to seek condonation on this score. 

 
5 
Criminal Appeal No.275 of 2020.  
Reliance is on cases reported as “KHUDA BAKHSH and others Versus 
MUZAFFAR 
through 
L.Rs. 
and 
others” 
(2007 
SCMR 
1032); 
“GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN through Ministry of Works and another 
Versus Messrs MALBROW BUILDERS, CONTRACTORS, SIALKOT” (2006 
SCMR 1248), “PAKISTAN through Secretary, Ministry of Defence versus 
Messr AZHAR BROTHERS LIMITED” (1990 SCMR 1059), “CHIEF 
SECRETARY, GOVERNMENT OF SINDH, KARKACHI and another Versus 
MUHAMMAD 
RAFIQUE 
SIDDIQUI” 
(2004 
PLC 
(C.S.) 
962), 
“COLLECTOR, LAND ACQUISITION, CHASHMA RIGHT BANK CANAL 
PROJECT, WAPDA, D.I. KHAN and others” (2002 SCMR 677), “LAHORE 
HIGH COURT, LAHORE, through Registrar versus NAZAR MUHAMMAD 
FATIANA and others” (1998 SCMR 2376), “CENTRAL, BOARD OF 
REVENUE, ISLAMABAD through Collector of Customs, Sialkot Dry Port, 
Samberial, District Sialkot and others versus Messrs RAJA INDUSIES (PVT. ) 
LTD, Through General Manager and 3 others” (1998 SCMR 307) and 
“FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through Secretary, Ministry of Finance versus 
NIAZ AHMAD” (1997 PLC (C.S.) 750. In the light of above it is held that 
where Government/State is provided six months’ limitation period for 
filing an appeal against acquittal, which is sufficient to recourse to legal 
remedy, then after period of limitation even delay of one day should not 
be condoned. 
8.      The law of limitation requires that a person must approach the Court 
and take recourse to legal remedies with due diligence, without 
dilatoriness and negligence and within the time provided by law, as 
against choosing his own time for the purpose of bringing forth a legal 
action at his own whim and desire. Because if that is so permitted to 
happen, it shall not only result in the misuse of the judicial process of the 
State, but shall also cause exploitation of the legal system and the society 
as a whole. This is not permissible in a State which is governed by law 
and Constitution. Reliance is on case reported as “Dr. MUHAMMAD 
JAVED SHAFI Versus SYED RASHID ARSHAD and others” (PLD 2015 
Supreme Court 212).

Criminal Appeal No.275 of 2020.  
9. 
Last but not the least, according to established principle of the 
criminal administration of justice once an acquittal is recorded in favour 
of accused facing criminal charge he enjoys twice the presumption of 
innocence, and such acquired right cannot be undone by ignoring the law 
of land applicable on the subject. The Supreme Court of Pakistan in case 
reported as “HUSSAIN BAKHSH versus ALLAH BAKHSH ETC” (1981 
SCMR 410) while referring the cases reported as “NAZAR versus. THE 
STATE” (1968 SCMR 715), “JALAL KHAN AND ANOTHER versus 
LAKHMIR AND ANOTHER” (1968 SCMR 1345), “MUHAMMAD KHAN 
versus SULTAN AND OTHERS” (1969 SCMR 82), “PIRAN DITTA versus 
THE STATE and 2 others” (1970 SCMR 282), and “NUR MUHAMMAD 
versus THE STATE” (1972 SCMR 331) has held that under our law, an 
acquittal can be challenged in certain circumstances, but if it is not 
challenged within the period allowed by law, it becomes final. In these 
circumstances it is only just and proper that a petition against acquittal 
must not be entertained if it is filed beyond time, unless it be shown that 
the petitioner was prevented from moving the same by an act of the 
acquitted accused; or by some circumstance of a compelling nature 
beyond the control of the petitioner. 
10. 
On the touchstone of above case law, we have gone through the 
reasons mentioned in the application seeking condonation of delay in 
filing the appeal and the same have not been found tenable/legal in any 
manner so as to entertain the appeal. Consequently, the application under 
section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1908 is dismissed; in consequence 
thereof, the main appeal also meets with the same fate.
