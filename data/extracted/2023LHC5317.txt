Date of hearing:    18.10.2023. 
Petitioners by: 
M/s Farooq Amjad Meer and Ahmad Farooq 
Meer, Advocates.  
Respondents by: 
M/s Mudassar  Raza Butt, Sajawal Javaid Butt 
and Muhammad Muazzam Akram, Advocates.  
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.- Through 
instant revision petition, petitioners have assailed judgment dated 
24.06.2022, passed by learned Addl. District Judge, Lahore, 
whereby respondents’ appeal against order dated 08.02.2021, 
passed by learned Civil Judge, Lahore, returning plaint of their suit 
under Order VII Rule 10  CPC, was accepted, impugned order was 
set aside and the matter was remanded to learned Trial Court for 
decision afresh on merits.  
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that respondents instituted a suit for 
recovery of damages of Rs.14 Million against petitioners, with the 
assertion that plaintiffs formed a musical collaboration, produced, 
wrote, composed, sang and arranged a song “Pyar Diyan Gallan” 
and throughout held all the rights and interests over the song’s 
audio and recordings, the original music works as well as the 
literary / artistic work involved therein; that the musical video is 
available on Daily Motion, Facebook and YouTube; that song’s 
basic melody and lyrics were composed and written by respondent 
No.1 in the year 1991; that the production was finalized at the 
residence of respondent No.3 in the year 1994; that composition 
and production was refined and lyrically improvised by respondent 

2 
C.R No.43193 of 2022 
 
No.2, who was also the producer and director of the original video 
of the song released in the year 1994; that respondent No.4 
performed one of the rap parts of the song; that in February, 2019, 
petitioners collusively remade / reproduced the song with behind 
the scene footage performing the original song “Pyar Diyan 
Gallan”; that petitioners broadcasted the same on various television 
channels through satellite and other available modes; that the song 
was also marketed and broadcasted in Pakistan and rest of the world 
and then aired on YouTube, Daily Motion and Facebook; that 
petitioners used the names of original artists and collaboration for 
commercial gains without the consent of the original stakeholders / 
producer / composer / lyricist of the song; that petitioners also did 
not obtain any license, permission or consent from the collaboration 
expressly or impliedly despite the fact that they were fully aware of 
the fact that the song was not a solo project but was done in 
collaboration; that petitioners passed off the original creators and 
misused their names without any authority; that respondents 
approached petitioners who initially tried to wriggle out by 
suggesting their good faith and then illegally shifted burden on 
respondent No.4 despite the fact that said respondent was not 
stakeholder of the song rather he merely joined the collaboration as 
a Rapper and had very little role to play in the song; that the song 
seriously jeopardized the repute of the collaboration, which needs 
an apology on media and payment of damages by petitioners. 
Petitioners filed application under Order VII Rule 10 CPC for 
return of plaint due to want of jurisdiction, which was resisted by 
respondents by filing written reply. After hearing arguments from 
both sides, learned Trial Court accepted the application and 
returned the plaint under aforesaid provisions of law vide order 
dated 08.02.2021. Feeling aggrieved, respondents assailed said 
order in appeal before learned Additional District Judge, which was 
accepted, order of learned Trial Court was set aside and the suit was 
remanded to learned Trial Court for decision afresh in accordance 

3 
C.R No.43193 of 2022 
 
with law after obtaining written statement from petitioners, framing 
of issues and recording evidence of the parties vide judgment dated 
24.06.2022. Hence, instant revision petition. 
3. 
Learned counsel for petitioners submits that contents of the 
plaint clearly suggest that respondents claimed copyrights of the 
song, alleged copyrights infringement and demanded fringe benefits 
of the copyrights, losses and other damages, not in torts. He 
contends that the Intellectual Property Tribunal (“IP Tribunal”) 
has exclusive jurisdiction in matters regarding infringement of 
Intellectual Property Laws, which includes infringement of 
copyrights. He argues that as per section 18 of the Intellectual 
Property Organization of Pakistan Act, 2012, all suits and other 
civil proceedings regarding infringement of copyrights are to be 
exclusively triable by an IP Tribunal. He maintains that the 
allegations: unauthorized reproduction of the song, use of behind 
the scene performance of original song; unauthorized broadcast 
and marketing; lack of permission or license from concerned 
authority constitute infringement of copyrights and come under the 
definition of copyright provided under section 3(1) of the Copyright 
Ordinance, 1962, thus Civil Court has no jurisdiction in the matter. 
He has referred to Muhammad Multazam Raza v. Muhammad Ayub 
Khan and others (2022 SCMR 979), Messrs Tabaq Restaurant v. 
Messrs Tabaq Restaurant (1987 SCMR 1090) and Messrs Shaheen 
Chemist through Proprietors and 3 others v. Zahid Mehmood 
Chaudhry and another (2023 CLD 1). 
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for respondents submits that the 
judgments relied upon by petitioners are regarding infringement of 
a registered trademark and the remedy / forum available thereof. He 
adds that the referred cases discuss passing off action in relation to 
a registered trademark but do not discuss the passing off action for 
unregistered trademark. He argues that the passing off claim 
simpliciter – not related to a registered trademark – is not defined in 
referred cases, however respondents’ claim was based simpliciter 

4 
C.R No.43193 of 2022 
 
on passing off action and not on infringement of trademark, hence 
Civil Court has jurisdiction in the matter. He has relied upon 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of 
Railways and others (2011 SCMR 1836), Mst. Zeeshan Nadeem v. 
Omer Aziz (2002 CLD 706), Messrs Fact Finders (Pvt.) Ltd. and 
others v. CNBC Pakistan and others (2022 CLC 1397), Reckitt and 
Colman Products Ltd. v. Borden Inc and others [(1990) 1 All ER 
873] and judgment dated 15.10.2015, passed by the Supreme Court 
of India in Criminal Appeals No.258 & 259 of 2013 titled Krishika 
Lulla and Ors. V. Shyam Vithalrao Devkatta & Anr.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused.  
6. 
The prime question for determination by this Court is 
whether the suit in question is triable by the Civil Court or 
Intellectual Property Tribunal. First of all, factual perspective of the 
lis and averments made in the plaint are to be comprehended. 
Respondents’ claim is that they created a song “Pyar Diyan Gallan” 
somewhere in the year 1994 and possessed all rights and interests 
with regard to its lyrics, production, melody, composition, audio & 
video recordings, and broadcasting on television and social media 
groups. However, petitioners remade / reproduced the song with 
behind the scene footage performing the original song “Pyar Diyan 
Gallan”, broadcasted the same on various television channels and 
social media, marketed in Pakistan and other countries, used the 
names of original artists and collaboration without the consent of 
the original stakeholders / collaboration. The stance of respondents 
is that their claim was based simpliciter on passing off action and 
not on infringement of registered trademark or copyrights, thus, 
applicability of Intellectual Property Laws is misconceived. 
Whereas, version of petitioners is that actually the claim is 
regarding infringement of copyrights attracting Intellectual Property 
Laws and plea of passing off simpliciter is fallacious.  
7. 
Infringement of trademark is actionable under section 46 of 
the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001, however the parties are in 

5 
C.R No.43193 of 2022 
 
agreement that controversy at hand is not related to infringement of 
trademark. Sub-section (3) of section 46 provides that the 
Ordinance ibid would not affect the action against any person for 
passing of goods as the goods of another person or services as 
services provided by another person, or the remedies in respect 
thereof. Basically a trade mark owner receives protection against 
use of his mark by another in such a way as is likely to lead 
consumers to associate the others’ goods with the trade mark 
owner. This protection against trade mark infringement, that is, 
against sale of another’s goods as those of the trade mark owner by 
use of the owner’s mark, may be described as protection against 
“passing off”. However, passing off also includes any other method 
by which one person’s goods are made to appear as if they 
originated from another, whether or not a trade mark is involved. 
Rule 11 of the Trade Marks Rules, 2004 deals with classification of 
goods and services, and provides that goods and services shall be 
classified in the manner specified in the Fourth Schedule. A 
comprehensive list containing 34 classes of vendible goods and 8 
classes of services is available in the said Schedule, however 
musical work is not mentioned. Likewise, definition of “services” 
provided in Section 2(xliii) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 
does not include musical work in the ambit of services.  
 
Conversely, the term “copyright” defined in Section 3 of the 
Copyright Ordinance, 1962 (“the Ordinance of 1962”), does 
include musical work and provides authority / right to perform 
certain acts in connection therewith, which is reproduced hereunder 
for ease of reference:- 
“3. Meaning of Copyright.--- 1. For the purpose of this Ordinance, 
"copyright" means the exclusive right, by virtue of, and subject to, the 
provisions of this Ordinance:- -----  
 
(a)  
in the case of a literary, dramatic or musical work, to do and 
 
authorize the doing of any of the following acts, namely:-  
 
 
(i)  
to reproduce the work in any material form;  
 
 
(ii)  
to publish the work;  
 
 
(iii)  
to perform the work in public;  

6 
C.R No.43193 of 2022 
 
 
 
(iv)  
to produce, reproduce, perform or publish any translation 
 
 
of the work;  
 
 
(v)  
to use the mark in a cinematographic work or make a 
 
 
record in respect of the work;  
 
 
(vi)  
to broadcast the work, or to communicate the broadcast 
 
 
of the work to the public by a loudspeaker or any other 
 
 
similar  instrument;  
 
 
(vii)  
to make any adaptation of the work;  
 
 
(viii)  
to do in relation to translation or an adaptation of the work 
 
 
any of  the acts specified in relation to the work in sub-
 
 
clauses (i) to (vi); 
8. 
Copyright in terms of section 3 of the Ordinance, 1962 is an 
exclusive right in relation to literary, dramatic, musical, artistic 
work, in any tangible medium of comprehension either audio or 
visual in any form that could be copied, reproduced, multiplied, 
communicated transmitted, repeated, broadcasted, telecasted, 
adopted in any form. "Copyright" from the scheme of the Copyright 
Ordinance appears to protect "copyright" in original work, by itself 
it is not relatable or associated with any vendible goods or services. 
The holder of such copyright in musical work has exclusive right to 
reproduce and multiply such work. From the scheme of the 
Copyright Ordinance, 1962 it appears that such Copyright work 
independently is capable of reproduction and reproduced copy is 
vendible independently and individually. It does not have any nexus 
with any other separate and independent vendible goods or services 
unless said work otherwise is also used as a trade mark under the 
Trade Marks Ordinance. 
9. 
It is conspicuous from the contents of the plaint, duly 
enumerated in para 2 of this judgment, that respondents claimed all 
rights and interests in their musical work i.e. the song “Pyar Diyan 
Gallan”, which duly comes under the meaning of “copyright” 
provided in the afore-referred provision along with passing off. The 
averments of the plaint encompass copyright infringement provided 
in Section 56 and do not come within the exceptions detailed in 
Section 57 of the Ordinance of 1962. Section 13 of the Ordinance 
of 1962 provides that the author of a work – in terms of section 

7 
C.R No.43193 of 2022 
 
2(d)(ii) of the Ordinance of 1962, author is the composer –shall be 
the first owner of the copyright therein. Section 39 of the Ordinance 
of 1962 provides procedure for the registration of copyrights but the 
same is not mandatory to claim infringement of copyrights as 
evident from narration of the provision. Section 42 of the Ordinance 
of 1962 declares the Register of Copyrights and the indexes as 
prima facie evidence of the particulars entered therein and 
admissible in evidence in Courts suggesting that copyright subsists 
in the work and the person showed therein is the owner of such 
copyright. The aforesaid provisions read as under:- 
39. Registration of copyrights, --(1) The author or publisher of, or the 
owner of or other person interested in the copyright in, any work may 
make an application in the prescribed form accompanied by the 
prescribed fee to the Registrar for entering particulars of the work in the 
Register of Copyrights.  
(2) On receipt of an application in respect of any work under subsection 
(1), the Registrar shall enter the particulars of the work in the Register of 
Copyrights and issue a certificate of such registration to the applicant 
unless, for reason to be recorded in writing, he considers that such entry 
should not be made in respect of any work; 
42. Register of Copyrights to be prima facie evidence of particulars 
entered therein, -- (1) The Register of Copyrights and the indexes shall 
be prima facie evidence of the particulars entered therein and documents 
purporting to be copies of any entry therein or extracts therefrom certified 
by the Registrar and sealed with the seal of the Copyright Office shall be 
admissible in evidence in all courts without further proof of production of 
the original.  
(2) A certificate of registration of copyright in a work shall be prima facie 
evidence that copyright subsists in the work and that the person shown in 
the certificate as the owner of the copyright is the owner of such 
copyright. 
A bare reading of section 39 shows that the use of expression "may" 
is permissive and does not make it obligatory for an author to get 
the copyright registered. The language of section 39, by any stretch 
of imagination, can be inferred to mean that the registration is 
compulsory for the enforcement of the copyright. The natural and 
ordinary meaning of the word "may" would make the registration 
optional and not compulsory. Moreover, the words "may" and 
"shall" in legal parlance are interchangeable, depending upon the 

8 
C.R No.43193 of 2022 
 
context in which they are used but legislative intent is to be seen 
and given effect to. The registration of copyrights in terms of 39 of 
the Ordinance of 1962 is not mandatory but optional with the 
author, publisher, owner or other person interested in the copyright.   
Similarly the phrase used in section 42 only raises a presumption 
that the person whose name is entered in the register is the author of 
the copyright. It certainly does not make the presumption 
conclusive. The very purpose of registration of copyright is to 
protect the interest of a person who has invented or prepared a 
particular work as against a person who wants to take undue 
advantage of the same in order to deceive the unwary public. 
Needless to say that mere failure to get the copyright registered 
does not invalidate or impair the copyright nor destroys the right to 
sue for copyright infringement. Reference can be made to Messrs 
Ferozesons Pvt. Ltd. v. Dr. Col. Retd. K.U. Kureshi and others 
(2003 CLD 1052), Rabia Bai v. Zeeshan Farooqi (2004 CLD 
1163), Digital Medial Solutions Private Limited through Company 
Secretary v. Warid Telecom Private Limited through Faisal Saeed 
(2012 CLD 858) and Glaxosmithkilne Services Limited v. Anfords 
Pakistan (Pvt) Limited (SBLR 2017 Sindh 1537). 
10. 
In India, the relevant provisions regarding the registration of 
copyrights are Sections 44 and 45 of the Copyright Act, 1957. 
Section 44 says that there shall be kept at the Copyright Office 
register in the prescribed form to be called register of copyright. 
Section 45, which is pari materia to section 39 of the Ordinance of 
1962, reads as under:  
45. (1) The author or publisher of, or the owner of or other person 
interested in the copyright in, any work may make an application in the 
prescribed form accompanied by the prescribed fee to the Registrar of 
Copyrights for entering particulars of the work in the Register of 
Copyrights. 
(2) On receipt of an application in respect of any work under sub-section 
(1), the Registrar of Copyrights may, after holding such inquiry as he may 
deem fit, enter the particulars of the work in the Register of Copyrights. 

9 
C.R No.43193 of 2022 
 
 
While interpreting afore-referred provision, the Dehli High 
Court in the case reported as Glaxo Operations UK Ltd., Middlesex 
(England), and others v. Samrat Pharmaceuticals, Kanpur (1984 
AIR (Delhi) 262) observed as under:- 
 
21…. It is apparent from a plain reading of Section 45 that it is 
discretionary with any author of any work to apply for the registration of 
copyrights and that registration as such does not confer any rights. There 
is no other provision at all in the Copyright Act which confers rights on 
account of registration of a copy right. Therefore, copyrights exist 
whether the registration is done or not and the registration is merely a 
piece of evidence as to when a certain author started claiming copyrights 
in some artistic or some other work.  
22.  
When the registration does not confer any rights it is to be seen 
as to how copyrights in favour of a person come into existence. Section 
13 of the Copyright Act gives a clue as to how a copyright is acquired. It 
says that copyright shall subsist throughout India, inter alia, in case of 
original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works. Therefore, 
emphasis is on the originality. It is, therefore, that artistic work which is 
original in which copyrights can vest. According to Section 17 of the 
author of the work shall be the owner of the copyright therein….” 
 
Similarly, section 48 of Indian Copyright Act, 1957 
corresponds to section 42 of the Ordinance of 1962, which reads as 
under:-  
48. Register of Copyrights to be prima facie evidence of particulars 
entered therein.-The Register of Copyrights shall be prima facie 
evidence of the particulars entered therein and documents purporting to 
be copies of any entries therein, or extracts therefrom certified by the 
Registrar of Copyrights and sealed with the seal of the Copyright Office 
shall be admissible in evidence in all Courts without further proof of 
production of the original. 
 
The Madras High Court in the case reported as M/s. Manojah 
Cine Productions v. A. Sundaresan and another [1976 AIR 
(Madras) 22], while dealing with afore-referred provision rendered 
following observations:-  
It may be seen from the provisions which we have just now noticed that 
the only effect of registration is what it stated in Section 48, to wit, that it 
shall be prima facie evidence of the particulars entered in the register. 
Hardly is there any indication in any of the provisions of the Act, read 
individually or as a whole, to suggest that registration is a condition 
precedent to subsistence of copyright or acquisition of ownership thereof.  
11. 
Having established that respondents’ claim is based on 
infringement of copyright and irrespective of registration of the 

10 
C.R No.43193 of 2022 
 
copyright, they are entitled to all remedies, provided in Chapter 
XIII of the Ordinance of 1962, by adopting procedures provided 
therein – in contrast to simpliciter passing off actionable in tort 
before the Court of first instance. A designated forum i.e. 
Intellectual Property Tribunal (section 16 of the IPO Act of 2012) 
has been provided, replacing the Court of District Judge earlier 
provided by the Ordinance of 1962. Section 17(4) of the IPO Act of 
2012 specifically provides that no court other than a Tribunal shall 
have or exercise any jurisdiction with respect to any matter to 
which the jurisdiction of the Tribunal extends under this Act. 
Section 18 of the IPO Act of 2012 talks about jurisdiction of the 
Tribunal and says that all suits and other civil proceedings 
regarding infringement of intellectual property laws shall be 
instituted and tried in the Tribunal. Moreover, the intent of 
legislature regarding exclusive jurisdiction of the tribunal in all 
matters of intellectual property rights can also be inferred from 
section 18(2), which contain a non-obstante clause, and clearly bars 
the jurisdiction of all other courts regarding offences pertaining to 
intellectual property laws which was otherwise available to a court 
of Magistrate of the first class under section 72 of the Copyright 
Ordinance, 1962. Section 18 (2) is reproduced as under: 
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time 
being in force, the Tribunal shall have exclusive jurisdiction to try any 
offence under intellectual property laws. 
Before pondering further upon the matter of jurisdiction in cases 
pertaining to intellectual property disputes, this Court has to first 
look into the intent of the legislature by taking into consideration 
the preamble of the IPO Act of 2012 to determine the scope of the 
IP Tribunal. The relevant portion of the preamble is reproduced as 
under: 
AND WHEREAS it is expedient to establish the Intellectual Property 
Organization of Pakistan to provide for the institutional arrangement in 
the state setup for taking up exclusively and comprehensively all subjects 
and matters relating to intellectual property rights in an integrated 
manner and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto; 

11 
C.R No.43193 of 2022 
 
The preamble makes it crystal clear that the very purpose of the 
IPO Act of 2012 is to consolidate the intellectual property regime 
by establishment of Intellectual Property Organization along with 
establishment of Intellectual Property Tribunal having exclusive 
jurisdiction in adjudication of all civil as well as criminal matters 
arising out of or in relation to the intellectual property laws in 
Pakistan. Moreover, there is no indication of even a slightest degree 
which can lead to the inference that any matter pertaining to 
intellectual property rights or matters connected therewith or 
incidental thereto is either excluded from the jurisdiction of the 
tribunal or that some restriction is imposed by the legislature for the 
exercise of said exclusive jurisdiction.  
 
Even otherwise, a Court which is specialized and exclusive 
on a particular subject would be more equipped and focused to deal 
with special subject which may involve interpretation of specialized 
legal terms and concepts, as compared to an ordinary Court of civil 
jurisdiction. This stance also finds its support from the latest 
amendment regarding jurisdiction of civil courts in the Code of 
Civil Procedure, 1908 (“CPC”). As per Province of Punjab 
Amendment brought in section 9 of CPC (inserted by Punjab Act 
XIV of 2018, dated 20th March, 2018), the jurisdiction of Courts 
provided in the CPC is barred where a general or special law is in 
force. From this perspective also, respondents cannot insist to 
pursue their claim before the Civil Court. 
12. 
The term “Intellectual Property Laws” has been defined in 
section 2(h) of the IPO Act of 2012 to mean that the laws specified 
in the Schedule. Entry 2 of the Schedule duly mentions “The 
Copyright Ordinance, 1962 (XXXIV of 1962)”. Needless to say 
that where the legislature has created a special Court that would 
deal with all matters relating to Intellectual Property Laws 
including matters relating to intellectual property rights along with 
matters concerned therewith or incidental thereto notwithstanding 
that the suit may involve other non-IP related matters. Reference 

12 
C.R No.43193 of 2022 
 
can be made to cases of Muhammad Multazam Raza and Messrs 
Shaheen Chemist supra. 
13.  
The reliance on case-law by learned counsel for respondents 
is misplaced as the referred cases are on quite distinguishable set of 
facts, thus inapplicable to the peculiar facts and circumstances of 
this case.  
14. 
In view of the above, instant petition is allowed and judgment 
dated 24.06.2022, passed by learned Addl. District Judge, Lahore, 
is set aside. Consequently, plaint of respondents’ suit shall stand 
returned for its presentation before concerned Intellectual Property 
Tribunal, if so advised.
