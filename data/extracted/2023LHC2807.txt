The amount of compensation and fine were ordered to be

Aggrieved by the said judgment, the appellant has filed the 
titled appeal against his convictions and sentences before this Court, 
whereas a criminal revision has also been filed by Abdul Waheed 
petitioner/complainant for enhancement of sentences of the appellant.  
Since common questions of law and facts are involved, 
therefore, supra mentioned matters are being disposed of by means of 
this single judgment.  
2. 
Narrating the prosecution story in FIR (Exh.PB/1), Abdul 
Waheed complainant (PW.2) stated that he was a resident of Chak 
No.117/9-L Kangni Wala and had established an oil agency at 
Bhallay Wala More. On 27.02.2013, his nephew Shahid Saeed son 
of Saeed Ahmad, caste Noon, resident of Chak No.117/9-L, 
proceeded from Bhallay Wala Kothi on Honda CD70 motorcycle 
bearing registration No.SLM-11/8297 to pay the price of milk 
amounting to Rs.1,00,000/- to complainant’s brother-in-law 
Muhammad Mushtaq resident of Chak No.96/D. At about 03:00 
p.m. when Shahid Saeed reached at a deteriorated metalled road 
within the area of Chak No.112/9-L Budh Dhakku Haji Jalal Din 
Dhakku, he was intercepted by three unknown accused, ages 
between 20 to 30 years, who were boarded on China model 
motorcycle No.4470. They stopped him on the strength of firearms 
and started giving butt blows to him. One of them snatched cash 
Rs.1,00,000/-, identity card and other documents from him and when 
he captured one of them, the other accused fired a pistol shot which 
landed on his chest and he fell on the ground. In the meanwhile, the 
complainant along with Muhammad Mushtaq Ahmad son of Sher 
Ahmad, caste Noon, resident of Chak No.90/9-L Wahdat Colony, 

Crl. Appeal No.95-J of 2016 & 
Crl. Revision No.172 of 2016

Arifwala Road, Tehsil and District Sahiwal, who were going to 
Chak No.96/D to meet his brother-in-law, also reached there and 
witnessed the occurrence. The accused gave murder threats to them 
and decamped towards Chak No.112/9-L on their motorcycle. 
Shahid Saeed was seriously injured and was shifted to Civil Hospital 
Sahiwal in the vehicle of Rescue 1122, where local police also 
arrived after gaining information about the occurrence. Due to 
Shahid Saeed's critical condition, he was admitted in the hospital; 
hence, this FIR.   
3. 
Initially, the crime report was lodged for the offences under 
sections 392, 394 PPC, but on sad demise of Shahid Saeed, offence 
under section 302 PPC was inserted therein. During investigation, 
Javed Iqbal co-accused was apprehended and presented before the 
learned trial court to face trial, but he was acquitted of the charge on 
the basis of compromise vide judgment dated 22.05.2014 passed by 
the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Sahiwal.  
The appellant was implicated in this case on the basis of 
disclosure of Javed Iqbal co-accused, but he could not be 
apprehended due to which report under section 512 Cr.P.C. was 
submitted before the learned trial court on 03.10.2013 after placing 
his name in column No.2 with red ink. Subsequently, the appellant 
was arrested in this case and after completion of investigation 
against him, report under section 173 Cr.P.C. was prepared and 
submitted before the learned trial court.  
4. 
After observing all the pre-trial codal formalities, on 
08.06.2015 the charge under sections 392, 394, 302, 34 PPC was 
framed against the appellant to which he pleaded not guilty and 
claimed trial. In order to prove its case, the prosecution produced as 
many as thirteen witnesses during the trial. Abdul Waheed 
complainant (PW.2) and Muhammad Mushtaq Ahmad (PW.3) have 
furnished the ocular account. Muhammad Zahid Ali, draftsman 
appeared as (PW.1), who sketched the scaled site plan (Exh.PA) of 

Crl. Appeal No.95-J of 2016 & 
Crl. Revision No.172 of 2016

the place of occurrence. Muhammad Arshad 873/C (PW.4) got 
Shahid Saeed (deceased) medically examined while he was in 
injured condition and after his death, his dead body along with 
police papers was brought before the doctor by this witness for post 
mortem examination. Muhammad Shehzad Akbar 1071/MHC 
(PW.5) lodged FIR (Exh.PB/1) on receipt of complaint (Exh.PB) 
without any addition or omission on his part. Liaqat Ali 354/C 
(PW.8) transmitted sealed parcels containing blood stained earth, 
crime empty of pistol 30 bore and led bullet to the office of PFSA 
Lahore. Imdad Ali (PW.9) identified the dead body of Shahid Saeed 
(deceased) at the time of post mortem. Rana Aneel Arshad, learned 
Judicial Magistrate (PW.10) supervised the proceedings of 
identification parade of the appellant. Muhammad Rustam Inspector 
(PW.12) and Sakhawat Ali SI (PW.13) being investigating officers 
stated about various steps taken by them during investigation of the 
case.  
Medical evidence was furnished by Dr. Shakeel David, MO 
(PW.6), who conducted post mortem examination on the dead body 
of Shahid Saeed (deceased) and prepared autopsy report (Ex.PJ) and 
Dr. Ejaz Hussain Awan (PW.11) who had medically examined 
Shahid Saeed (deceased) while he was in injured condition and 
issued MLC (Exh.PQ).  
 
Rest of the prosecution witnesses are, more or less, formal in 
nature. The prosecution gave up Mushtaq Ahmad son of Mudaee, 
Husnain Ahmad, learned Judicial Magistrate and Saeed Ahmad S.I. 
being unnecessary and closed its evidence after tendering the reports 
of Punjab Forensic Science Agency Lahore regarding blood stained 
earth (Exh.PBB) and regarding crime empty and pistol (Exh.PCC).  
5. 
On completion of prosecution evidence, the appellant was 
examined under section 342 Cr.P.C. whereby he once again denied 
the allegations leveled against him and professed his innocence. 

Crl. Appeal No.95-J of 2016 & 
Crl. Revision No.172 of 2016

While answering to a question, “why this case against you and why 
the PWs have deposed against you?, he stated as under:- 
“It is a fake case. The PWS are related inter-se and with the 
deceased and they had made false statements against me. It 
was a blind murder and an un-witnessed occurrence. The 
deceased was going alone on the motorcycle when he was 
done to death by unknown culprits. None of the alleged eye 
witnesses including the complainant was present at the spot 
at the time of occurrence. I was arrested by the local police 
of police station Sadder Arifwala in another false case. 
Sakhawat Ali S.I the I.O of this case when learnt about my 
arrest by Arifwala police, he took Abdul Waheed the 
complainant and Muhammad Mushtaq Ahmad PW with him 
to Arifwala where the 1.O showed me to the alleged eye 
witnesses of this case to facilitate them to identify me in the 
test identification parade. Sakhawat Ali S.I, the I.O of this 
case in order to show his efficiency in tracing out a blind 
murder fabricated all the evidence against me. In fact, I am 
innocent and I had not murdered the deceased. All the 
alleged recoveries of pistol P-1, 03-live bullets P-2/1-3, 
identity card of the deceased P-3, school leaving certificate 
of the deceased P-4 and a copy of domicile of the deceased 
P-5 are fake and planted. The police and the complainant 
party had suspected many persons for the murder of the 
deceased and in this respect such persons were hauled up 
by the police and an arbitration deed was executed to 
decide the involvement of such person in this case as is 
admitted by the complainant in his statement.”  
 
The appellant neither opted to make statement on oath as 
provided under Section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor produced any evidence in 
disproof of the allegations leveled by the prosecution against him.  
6. 
The learned trial court, on conclusion of trial vide judgment 
dated 17.03.2016, convicted and sentenced the appellant as 
mentioned hereinabove.  
7. 
Learned defence counsel argued that the FIR in this case was 
lodged with the delay of nine hours and forty minutes after the 
incident, which conclusively proved that it was an unseen 
occurrence; that despite considerable delay in lodging FIR, the 
appellant was not nominated therein and even no features of the 
assailants were  mentioned in it; that the implication of the appellant 
in this case is nothing less than a mystery as the prosecution itself is 

Crl. Appeal No.95-J of 2016 & 
Crl. Revision No.172 of 2016 
 
6
confused as to whether he was nominated through some sort of 
supplementary statement of the complainant or on the basis of 
disclosure of co-accused; that proceeding under section 87, Cr.P.C. 
was initiated against the appellant prior to causing his arrest in this 
case and followed by identification parade, which shows that his 
identity was an open secret for alleged eye witnesses; that under the 
attending circumstances of the case, the identification parade of the 
appellant does not carry any legal worth for the purpose of 
maintaining appellant’s conviction and sentences; that the alleged 
eye witnesses could not justify their presence at the place of 
occurrence at relevant time and they even contradicted each other 
while describing the role of appellant during the occurrence; that the 
alleged eye witnesses also made material improvements to their 
earlier statements, which made them unreliable witnesses and more 
importantly the story of occurrence narrated by them does not appeal 
to any prudent mind; that the recoveries of weapon of offence and 
other articles were planted upon the appellant only to strengthen the 
prosecution case against him. Lastly contended that the prosecution 
has miserably failed to prove the case against the appellant and has 
prayed that the appellant may be acquitted of the charge leveled 
against him by accepting the instant appeal. 
8. 
Conversely, learned Law Officer assisted by learned counsel 
for the complainant argued that the prosecution has successfully 
proved its case against the appellant beyond any shadow of doubt 
through convincing, unimpeachable and overwhelming evidence. 
The appellant has been duly identified by the PWs in the 
identification parade. The prosecution has proved its case upto the 
hilt. Learned counsel for the complainant added that the appellant 
had committed the murder of an innocent person during an 
occurrence of robbery, but the learned trial court has taken leniency 
while deciding the quantum of sentences, therefore, keeping in view 
the gravity of offence the quantum of sentences already awarded to 

Crl. Appeal No.95-J of 2016 & 
Crl. Revision No.172 of 2016 
 
7
the appellant even liable to be enhanced as per law. Both have 
prayed for dismissal of appeal.  
9. 
After hearing the learned defence counsel as well as learned 
Law Officer assisted by the learned counsel for the complainant and 
examining the record, it is observed that according to FIR 
(Exh.PB/1), the unfortunate incident had reportedly taken place on 
27.02.2013 at about 03:00 p.m. but despite the fact that the police 
station was merely six miles away from the place of occurrence, 
neither police itself came to the crime scene nor the complainant 
bothered to inform the police about the occurrence with 
promptitude. According to police proceedings on written application 
(Exh.PB) for registration of crime report, Muhammad Ashraf S.I. 
along with other police officials arrived at DHQ Hospital, Sahiwal 
and received written application (Exh.PB) from Abdul Waheed 
complainant (PW.2) at 11:50 p.m. (night), where-after the FIR 
(Exh.PB/1) was chalked out at 12:40 a.m. (night) on 28.02.2013 
with the delay of 09 hours and 40 minutes of the occurrence. There 
is no explanation at all that if Abdul Waheed complainant (PW.2) 
and Muhammad Mushtaq Ahmad (PW.3) had witnessed the incident 
which took place at about 03:00 p.m. on 27.02.2013, then what had 
impeded them from reporting the incident to the police within 
reasonable time. Keeping in view the significant delay in lodging the 
FIR (Exh.PB/1), I am convinced that the matter was reported to the 
police after due deliberation and consultation and the intervening 
time was consumed in calling the relatives of the deceased. While 
holding so, I am guided by the dictum of law laid down by the apex 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Ghulam Abbas and 
another v. The State and another” (2021 SCMR 23), in paragraph 
No.4 of which it has been held as under:- 
“4. As per contents of FIR, the occurrence in this case 
took place on 19.06.2008 at 01.40 a.m. and the matter 
was reported to the Police on the same morning at 07.00 
a.m. and as such there is a delay of more than five hours 
in reporting the crime to the Police whereas Police 

Crl. Appeal No.95-J of 2016 & 
Crl. Revision No.172 of 2016 
 
8
Station was situated at a distance of just six kilometers 
from the place of occurrence. No explanation whatsoever 
was furnished by the complainant for this delay in 
reporting the crime to the Police. Hameed Ullah Khan SI 
(PW.15) who investigated the case stated during his 
cross-examination that he reached at the place of 
occurrence at about 05.00 a.m. and he had completed the 
police proceedings by 06.30 p.m. In the circumstances, 
chances of deliberations and consultations before 
reporting the matter to the Police cannot be ruled out.” 
I have also fortified my above view regarding delay in lodging 
FIR from the case reported as “Pervaiz Khan and another v. The 
State” (2022 SCMR 393).  
10. 
It further manifests from the record that the appellant is not 
named in any capacity as an accused in FIR (Exh.PB/1) wherein it is 
mentioned that the occurrence was committed by three unknown 
accused. Since the appellant was not nominated in FIR (Exh.PB/1), 
the prosecution has heavily relied upon the evidence of identification 
parade in order to prove his culpability in this case. In this context, 
Abdul Waheed complainant (PW.2) and Muhammad Mushtaq 
Ahmad (PW.3) being purported eye witnesses, Rana Aneel Arshad 
learned Judicial Magistrate (PW.10) who supervised identification 
parade and Sakhawat Ali S.I./I.O. (PW.13) are the relevant 
witnesses. 
First comes the statements of Abdul Waheed complainant 
(PW.2) and Muhammad Mushtaq Ahmad (PW.3). A critical analysis 
of the said statements made it crystal clear that they could not 
mention any features of the assailants during investigation before the 
police as well as before the learned trial court except that their ages 
were between 20 to 30 years. During his cross-examination, Abdul 
Waheed complainant (PW.2) stated as under:- 
“……… I have not mentioned the face features of the 
culprits in Ex.PB. I have not mentioned the body features of 
the culprits in Ex.PB. I have not mentioned the complexion 
of the culprits. I have not mentioned the heights of the 
culprits in Ex.PB………” 

Crl. Appeal No.95-J of 2016 & 
Crl. Revision No.172 of 2016 
 
9
Same is the position of Muhammad Mushtaq Ahmad (PW.3), 
who stated during his cross-examination as infra:- 
“……… I had not stated the face features of the assailants 
to the I.O in Ex.DC. I had not stated the body features of the 
assailants in Ex.DC. I had not mentioned the face 
colour/complexion of the assailants in Ex.DC. I had not 
mentioned the heights of the assailants in Ex.DC………” 
I may observe here that the above noted material discrepancy, 
alone, is sufficient to diminish the evidentiary value of identification 
parade and while holding so, I am fortified from the dictum laid 
down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of 
“Sabir Ali alias Fauji v. The State” (2011 SCMR 563), wherein it 
has been settled that identification test parade is of no value when 
description/ features of accused is not given in the contents of the 
FIR. Further guidance can also be sought from the case of “Javed 
Khan alias Bacha and another v. The State and another” (2017 
SCMR 524), wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan has laid 
down the following principle:- 
“8. 
The Complainant (PW-5) had not mentioned any 
features of the assailants either in the FIR or in his 
statement recorded under section 161, Cr.P.C. therefore 
there was no benchmark against which to test whether the 
appellants, who he had identified after over a year of the 
crime, and who he had fleetingly seen, were in fact the 
actual culprits. Neither of the two Magistrates had certified 
that in the identification proceedings the other persons, 
amongst whom the appellants were placed, were of similar 
age, height, built and colouring. The main object of 
identification proceedings is to enable a witness to properly 
identify a person involved in a crime and to exclude the 
possibility of a witness simply confirming a faint 
recollection or impression, that is, of an old, young, tall, 
short, fat, thin, dark or fair suspect. There is yet another 
aspect to the matter of identification of the culprits of this 
case. The Complainant had named three other persons who 
could recognize the assailants, but he did not mention 
Subedar Mehmood Ahmad Khan (PW-6) as one of them. 
Nonetheless Subedar Mehmood Ahmad Khan came forward 
to identify the appellants. Significantly, none of the three 
persons mentioned by the Complainant participated in the 
identification proceedings and two were not even produced 
as witnesses by the Prosecution. During the identification 

Crl. Appeal No.95-J of 2016 & 
Crl. Revision No.172 of 2016 
 
10
proceedings both the appellants had informed the 
Magistrates who were conducting the identification 
proceedings, and before the identification proceedings 
commenced, that they had earlier been shown to the 
witnesses. The Magistrates recorded this objection of the 
appellants in their reports but surprisingly did not attend to 
it, which can only be categorized as a serious lapse on their 
part. Therefore, for all these reasons reliance cannot be 
placed upon the report of the identification proceedings in 
which the appellants were identified.” 
11. 
Another intriguing aspect of the case which badly shattered 
the evidentiary value of identification parade is that on 22.10.2013, 
Sakhawat Ali S.I./I.O. (PW.13) received information regarding the 
arrest of appellant in case FIR No.492 of 2013 registered for the 
offences under sections 457, 380, 411 PPC, at Police Station Saddar 
Arifwala and on 29.10.2013, he submitted an application (Exh.PT) 
before the DPO Sahiwal for transferring the appellant in this case 
and on behalf of the DPO Sahiwal, a letter No.4272/L dated 
29.10.2013 (Exh.PU) was submitted before the worthy Sessions 
Judge, Sahiwal. On 18.11.2013, the investigating officer submitted 
an application (Exh.PV) before the learned Area Magistrate of 
Police Station Saddar Arifwala for obtaining permission to join the 
appellant in the investigation, which was allowed and the appellant 
was joined in the investigation and also formally arrested by him in 
this case. Thereafter, the investigating officer submitted another 
application (Exh.PW) for summoning the appellant before the 
learned Area Magistrate of Police Station Saddar Arifwala for 
20.11.2013 and on this date i.e. 20.11.2013, he obtained transitory 
remand of appellant through application (Exh.PX) and produced him 
before the court of learned Area Magistrate of Police Station Dera 
Rahim Sahiwal with the application (Exh.PY) that the appellant be 
sent to judicial lock-up for identification parade. On 23.11.2013, the 
investigating officer submitted another application (Exh.PZ) before 
the learned Area Magistrate of Police Station Dera Rahim, Sahiwal, 
upon which a date i.e. 26.11.2013 was fixed for identification of 
appellant.  

Crl. Appeal No.95-J of 2016 & 
Crl. Revision No.172 of 2016 
 
11
It can be easily visualized from the above highlighted exercise 
of the investigating officer that the name of the appellant had already 
come to light in this case as an accused much prior to holding his 
identification parade. Even Sakhawat Ali S.I./I.O. (PW.13) during 
the course of his cross-examination stated as under:- 
“When the file of this case was entrusted to me for 
investigation, Imran accused present in the court had 
already been nominated as accused in this case.” 
Besides above, it is discernable from the narration of 
application for transitory remand  of the appellant in the case in hand 
(Exh.PT) and remand judicial application for identification parade 
(Exh.PY) that Javaid Iqbal, co-accused of the appellant made 
discloser at the time of his arrest under section 54 Cr.P.C.  in this 
case that he committed the occurrence along with Muhammad Imran 
appellant. Thereafter, above said Javaid Iqbal, co-accused was 
challaned in this case and appellant was declared proclaimed 
offender. In the eventuality of above mentioned circs, identification 
parade after appellant’s nomination in this case is highly doubtful 
and the same carries no legal worth.  
12. 
It cannot be ignored that the appellant was aged about 35 
years at the time of his arrest, which was caused about nine months 
after the occurrence, but according to prosecution’s own showings, 
the assailants who committed the occurrence were aged about 20 to 
30 years whereas ages of all the nine dummies were 32 to 38 years. 
Moreover, no features of the dummies have been mentioned in the 
report of identification parade (Exh.PP) and this fact has also been 
endorsed by Rana Aneel Arshad, learned Magistrate (PW.10), who 
supervised the proceeding of identification parade. Relevant portion 
of cross-examination upon him is mentioned below:- 
“..It is correct that I did not mention the specific 
features of Dummies who joined the test identification 
parade in my report Ex.PP…” 

Crl. Appeal No.95-J of 2016 & 
Crl. Revision No.172 of 2016 
 
12
 
The above-mentioned shortcoming during identification test 
parade makes the whole process null and void. Reliance is 
respectfully placed on the case of “Muhammad Ayaz and others v. 
The State” (2011 SCMR 769), wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court 
of Pakistan has held as under:- 
“17. The test identification parade was held on 21-8-2002 
in Adyala Jail. The report of the said proceedings 
supervised by Mr. Amjad Saeed, Special Judicial 
Magistrate (P.W.22) are available on record as Exh.PYY/1. 
The, said report mentions the names of twenty one persons 
(the dummies) with whom the three appellants were mixed 
for the purpose. The description of these twenty one 
dummies is confined only to their names and their 
parentage and it is not discernible from the said description 
whether they were the inmate prisoners of the jail or had 
been imported from elsewhere” 
Further reference in this respect may be made to the case 
titled as “Mian Sohail Ahmad and others v. The State and others” 
(2019 SCMR 956).  
13. 
I have noted that initially, the appellant was nominated in this 
case on the basis of disclosure of co-accused Javaid Iqbal as evident 
from the contents of application for holding identification parade of 
appellant (Exh.PN) and application for transfer of appellant 
(Exh.PT) but such type of evidence, I am afraid, is hit by the 
provision of Article 38 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, and 
cannot be used as evidence against the appellant. Reliance is placed 
on the case of “Shafqat Abbas and another v. The State” (2007 
SCMR 162), wherein the following principle has been laid down by 
the august Supreme Court of Pakistan:- 
“The attributed disclosure made by accused Nazar Abbas 
before the Investigating Officer in presence of P.W. 
Muhammad 
Sharif 
during 
interrogation, 
involving 
appellants Shafqat Abbas, Mujahid Hussain and others in 
the commission of the offence, not leading to the discovery 
of a particular relevant fact or incriminating material is 
inconsequential and inadmissible, therefore, in view of the 
above discussion and reasons by extending benefit of doubt 
in favour of the appellants in the given facts and 
circumstances of the case, they have been found entitled to 

Crl. Appeal No.95-J of 2016 & 
Crl. Revision No.172 of 2016 
 
13
earn acquittal. Resultantly, their convictions and sentences 
awarded by the learned trial Court under sections 
302/324/34, P.P.C. and maintained by the learned High 
Court in appeal filed by the appellants were set side vide 
our short order. Accordingly, they have been acquitted of 
the charges and their appeal accepted” 
14. 
It is noteworthy that Muhammad Imran appellant was arrested 
in this case on 20.11.2013 after eight months and twenty three days 
of the occurrence and identification parade was conducted on 
26.11.2013 with the delay of six days after his arrest. Such 
noticeable delay in conducting the identification parade makes it 
doubtful in nature. I may fortify my view from the dictum laid down 
in case titled as “Sabir Ali alias Fauji v. The State” (2011 SCMR 
563) wherein it has been held by the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan as under:- 
“….Identification parade was held after about six 
months from the date of occurrence and also conducted 
after a delay of 09 days after the arrest of the accused. 
This delay per se in both counts create lot of doubt 
regarding the identification parade as witnesses had 
various opportunities to see the accused persons…” 
15. 
Another important aspect of this case which has also shattered 
the authenticity of identification parade is that the appellant made 
objection before Rana Aneel Arshad, learned Judicial Magistrate 
(PW.10) at the time of proceeding of identification parade that when 
he was arrested, complainant and PWs were accompanying the local 
police and they also knew him previously. He filed petitions against 
the complainant as well as local police in the court of learned 
Sessions Judge, Sahiwal and Lahore High Court Lahore wherein 
SHO concerned was summoned by the court and due to this grudge, 
complainant and local police entangled him in this case. It is 
noteworthy that Rana Aneel Arshad, learned Judicial Magistrate 
(PW.10) has not decided the supra-mentioned objection of the 
appellant. In this way, there is serious lapse on his part. Reference 
can be made to the case law titled as “Javed Khan alias Bacha and 
another v. The State and another” (2017 SCMR 524).

Ocular account in this case came out from the mouths of 
Abdul Waheed complainant (PW.2) and Muhammad Mushtaq 
Ahmad (PW.3). In addition to the considerable delay in lodging the 
FIR which apparently dislodged the presence of above mentioned 
prosecution witnesses at the place of occurrence at relevant time, 
there are certain other circumstances which create serious doubt qua 
their veracity and truthfulness. In this regard, it is observed that both 
Abdul Waheed complainant (PW.2) and Muhammad Mushtaq 
Ahmad (PW.3) throughout took the stance that they had attended 
Shahid Saeed (deceased), then injured, immediately after the 
occurrence and had shifted him to DHQ Hospital through the vehicle 
of Rescue 1122, but Dr. Ejaz Hussain Awan, SMO (PW.11), who 
had medically examined Shahid Saeed (deceased), in an injured 
condition, stated during the course of his cross-examination as 
under:- 
“It is correct that I signed and sealed with stamp the 
injury statement which is Ex.PR. According to the injury 
statement of Shahid Saeed deceased Ex.PR the injured 
firstly went to the police post Shareenwala More where 
Zahoor Hussain ASI prepared the said injury statement 
Ex.PR and then Muhammad Arshad constable No.873-C 
took Shahid Saeed to the DHQ Hospital Sahiwal in 
injured condition….” 
Abdul Waheed complainant (PW.2) and Muhammad Mushtaq 
Ahmad (PW.3) also could not explain the circumstance whereby the 
deceased, then injured, was taken to Police Post Shareenwala before 
bringing him to DHQ Hospital Sahiwal for medical examination. 
Furthermore, they contradicted each other while attributing role to 
the appellant at the time of his identification parade as according to 
Abdul Waheed complainant (PW.2), the appellant had snatched the 
amount and his co-accused had caused firearm injury on the person 
of deceased, but according to Muhammad Mushtaq Ahmad (PW.3), 
the appellant had made the fire shot. Relevant portions of their 
statements recorded by Rana Aneel Arshad, learned Judicial 

Crl. Appeal No.95-J of 2016 & 
Crl. Revision No.172 of 2016 
 
15
Magistrate (PW.10) at the time of conducting identification parade 
are reproduced as under:- 
:عبدالوحید مدعی 
۔۔۔۔۔۔ ملزم عمران نے مقتول شاہد سے پیس ے چھینے اور دوسرے ملزم نے
شاہد کو فائر مارا جو کہ اسکی پسلی میں لگا۔ 
:محمد مشتاق گواہ 
 ۔۔۔۔۔۔ ملزم
عمران 
 نے لڑائی جھگڑے کے دوران پسٹل نکالی اور شاہد کو
فائر مار دیا۔ 
 Another important circumstance which prompted this Court 
to discredit the testimonies of Abdul Waheed complainant (PW.2) 
and Muhammad Mushtaq Ahmad (PW.3) is that according to their 
own version, they were nothing but chance witnesses who had 
miserably failed to advance any plausible reason for their presence 
at the place of occurrence at relevant time. Abdul Waheed 
complainant (PW.2) while recording his examination-in-chief, has 
stated that on the eventful day at about 02:45 p.m. he handed over  
Rs.1,00,000/- to his nephew Shahid Saeed (deceased)  for onward 
transmission to his brother-in-law Muhammad Mushtaq son of 
Mudaee Khan (jettisoned witness) resident of Chak No.96/D in lieu 
of price of milk and after about ten minutes, he along with 
Muhammad Mushtaq Ahmad (PW.3) also proceeded to Chak 
No.96/D to meet his brother-in-law Muhammad Mushtaq son of 
Mudaee Khan (jettisoned witness), but when Shahid Saeed reached 
within the area of Chak No.112/9-L, he was targeted by robbers who 
also committed his murder. Muhammad Mushtaq Ahmad (PW.3), in 
an attempt to establish his presence at the place of occurrence, also 
deposed in almost similar manner. It is important to mention here 
that above said PW.3 while recording his statement before learned 
Magistrate (PW.10) at the time of identification parade of appellant 
(Exh.PP) stated that his nephew was going after taking the payment 
of milk, accused persons stopped him near Chak No. 112/9-L and 

Crl. Appeal No.95-J of 2016 & 
Crl. Revision No.172 of 2016 
 
16
started quarreling with him. They were also chasing the deceased as 
they were going in connection with some other job but they were not 
aware that their nephew was travelling ahead of them. During the 
scuffle accused Imran (appellant) took out pistol and inflicted fire 
shot upon Shahid Saeed deceased. It is crystal-clear that the place of 
occurrence in this case was the one where Abdul Waheed 
complainant (PW.2) and Muhammad Mushtaq Ahmad (PW.3) 
should have not normally been present exactly at the time of 
occurrence and when this fact is taken into account along with 
considerable delay of nine hours and forty minutes in lodging the 
FIR, I find no option but to declare them related, interested and 
chance witnesses and as such their evidence is not free from doubt. 
Reference in this respect may be made to the cases titled as “Mst. 
Mir Zalai v. Ghazi Khan and others” (2020 SCMR 319), “Ibrar 
Hussain and another v. The State” (2020 SCMR 1850) and “Liaqat 
Ali and another v. The State and others” (2021 SCMR 780).  
Another fact which cannot be ignored is that the narration of 
incident itself made the presence of Abdul Waheed complainant 
(PW.2) and Muhammad Mushtaq Ahmad (PW.3) at the place of 
occurrence at relevant time highly doubtful as if Abdul Waheed 
complainant (PW.2) along with Muhammad Mushtaq Ahmad 
(PW.3) had to proceed to Chak No.96/D to see his brother-in-law 
Muhammad Mushtaq (jettisoned witness) just within ten minutes of 
departure of his nephew Shahid Saeed (deceased), then there was no 
reasoning for Abdul Waheed complainant (PW.2) to handover the 
amount of Rs.1,00,000/- to the deceased for its onward payment to 
Muhammad Mushtaq (jettisoned witness) at Chak No.96/D. The 
story narrated by the prosecution witnesses, particularly in respect of 
their presence at the place of occurrence at relevant time, is clearly 
farfetched and absolutely not comprehendible to human prudence. 
17. 
I have also noticed with grave concern that prosecution itself 
was not certain regarding the culprits as Abdul Waheed complainant 

Crl. Appeal No.95-J of 2016 & 
Crl. Revision No.172 of 2016 
 
17
(PW.2) categorically admitted during his cross-examination that he 
had suspicion upon one Muhammad Riaz son of Sher Muhammad 
for the murder of Shahid Saeed (deceased) and in this regard, a 
“panchait” (پنچایت) was convened and an arbitration deed was also 
executed regarding the innocence of above said Muhammad Riaz. If 
such was the state of affairs after the happening of occurrence, there 
can be no second thought that Abdul Waheed complainant (PW.2) 
and Muhammad Mushtaq Ahmad (PW.3) are not truthful or reliable 
witnesses.   
18. 
It is further discernable from the evidence on the file that 
Abdul Waheed complainant (PW.2) and Muhammad Mushtaq 
Ahmad (PW.3) have made blatant and dishonest improvements to 
their earlier statements. In this regard, relevant portion from the 
statement of Abdul Waheed complainant (PW.2) is reproduced as 
under:- 
“I have not mentioned that Imran accused present in the 
court had snatched the amount from Shahid Saeed 
deceased and other accused made fire upon Shahid Saeed 
deceased. Confronted with Ex.DB wherein it is so 
recorded in portion A to A. The witness volunteered that 
the other accused snatched the amount from the deceased 
and Imran accused present in the court made fire upon 
Shahid Saeed deceased. 
I have mentioned in my statement Ex.PB the 
description and features of the culprits. Confronted with 
Ex.PB wherein the features are not mentioned. ……… 
………I have stated in Ex.PB that I and Shahid Saeed 
deceased used to run an Oil Agency at Bhalleywala More 
jointly. Confronted with Ex.PB where specifically runs an 
Oil Agency jointly is not mentioned. I have stated in my 
statement Ex.PB that on the day of occurrence I and 
Shahid Saeed deceased were present at Adda Bhalleywala 
More and I handed over Rs.1,00,000/- to Shahid Saeed 
deceased for onward transmission to my brother-in-law. 
Confronted with Ex.PB wherein it is not so recorded. I 
have stated in my statement Ex.PB that the deceased left 
Bhalleywala More at about 2:45 p.m. Confronted with 
Ex.PB wherein time i.e. 2:45 p.m is not mentioned. I have 
stated that after 10 minutes for the departure of the 
deceased from Bhalleywala More, I and Mushtaq Ahmad 
PW also proceeded to Chak No.96/D on motorcycle. 
Confronted with Ex.PB where our departure after 10-

Crl. Appeal No.95-J of 2016 & 
Crl. Revision No.172 of 2016 
 
18
minutes from the departure of the deceased is not 
mentioned. I have stated in my Ex.PB when we reached in 
the area of Chak No.112/9-L "Budh Dhakoo". At that 
time, Shahid Saeed deceased ahead from us. Confronted 
with Ex.PB wherein it is not so recorded. I have stated in 
my statement that in our view the accused persons gave 
beating to him. Confronted with Ex.PB wherein it is not 
so recorded. I have stated in my statement that after the 
occurrence the accused persons fled away from the spot 
along with their respective weapons and looted amount 
on a motorcycle. Confronted with Ex.PB where weapons 
and looted amount is not mentioned………” 
Similarly, relevant portion of dishonest improvements from 
the statement of Muhammad Mushtaq Ahmad (PW.3) is described 
infra:- 
“………I have stated in my police statement that on the 
day of occurrence, I went to Bhalleywala More at about 
2:45 p.m on the day of occurrence. Confronted with 
Ex.DC wherein it is not so recorded. I have stated in my 
police statement that Abdul Waheed complainant runs an 
Oil Agency at Adda Bhalleywala More. Confronted with 
Ex.DC wherein it is not so recorded. I have stated in my 
police statement that on the day of occurrence I and 
Abdul Waheed complainant started journey towards 
96/D. Confronted with Ex.DC wherein it is not so 
recorded. I have stated in my police statement that when 
we reached within the limits of Bhud Dhakoo in our view 
03-unknown persons grappled with Shahid Saeed 
deceased and they beating him. Confronted with Ex.DC 
wherein when we reached within the limits of Bhud 
Dhakoo in our view is not mentioned. I have stated in my 
police statement that the unknown accused persons 
snatched domicile and school leaving certificate from the 
deceased. Confronted with Ex.DC wherein it is not so 
recorded. However, it is mentioned that the unknown 
accused persons snatched identity card of the deceased 
and some documents from the deceased. I have mentioned 
in my police statement that the accused persons fled away 
from the spot along with their respective weapons and 
looted amount. Confronted with Ex.DC wherein the 
weapon and looted amount is not mentioned. I have stated 
in my police statement that the deceased died when he 
reached at DHQ Hospital Sahiwal. I have stated in my 
police statement that Shahid Saeed deceased died on the 
following day of the occurrence. Confronted with Ex.DC 
wherein it is not so recorded. I have mentioned the 
features and description of the unknown assailants. 
Confronted with Ex.DC wherein description and features 
are not mentioned. However, there is mentioned only the 
ages of the assailants 20/30 years. ………. I had stated in 

Crl. Appeal No.95-J of 2016 & 
Crl. Revision No.172 of 2016 
 
19
my police statement that who assailant snatched the 
amount from the deceased with his features, who 
assailant made fire towards the deceased with his feature. 
Confronted with Ex.DC wherein specifically features with 
role are not mentioned. ………. 
I have got recorded my statement to the learned 
Area Magistrate at the time of test identification. I have 
stated before the learned Area Magistrate that the 
unknown culprits snatched Rs.1,00,000/- from the 
deceased. Confronted with Ex.DD wherein it is not so 
recorded. ………” 
It is obvious that the said witnesses have improved their 
statements in order to establish their presence at the crime scene and 
to strengthen the prosecution case against the appellant, but such an 
attempt is not tenable under the law. There is no cavil to the 
proposition that when the witnesses improve their statements to 
strengthen the prosecution case and the moment it is concluded that 
improvements were made deliberately and with mala fide intention, 
the testimonies of such witnesses become unreliable. The Hon’ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan has observed in a plethora of judgments 
that the witnesses who made dishonest improvements in their 
statements on material aspects of the case in order to fill the lacunas 
of the prosecution case or to bring their statements in line with other 
prosecution evidence are not worthy of reliance. Reference in this 
respect may be made to the judgment reported as “Muhammad Arif 
v. The State” (2019 SCMR 631) wherein the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan has enunciated the following principle:- 
“ It is well established by now that when a witness 
improves his statement and moment it is observed that the 
said improvement was made dishonestly to strengthen the 
prosecution, such portion of his statement is to  be 
discarded out of consideration. Having observed the 
improvements in the statements of both the witnesses of 
ocular account, we hold that it is not safe to rely on their 
testimony to maintain conviction and sentence of 
Muhammad Arif (appellant) on a capital charge.” 
 
I have also fortified my above view from the dictum laid 
down in cases titled as “Khalid Mehmood and another v. The State” 

Crl. Appeal No.95-J of 2016 & 
Crl. Revision No.172 of 2016 
 
20
(2021 SCMR 810) and “Rafaqat Ali Vs. The State” (2022 SCMR 
1107). 
19. 
Coming to the evidentiary worth of medical evidence, it is 
settled law that medical evidence may confirm the ocular evidence 
with regard to the seat of injury, nature of the injury, kind of weapon 
used in the occurrence but it would not connect the accused with the 
commission of offence. Reference in this respect may be made to the 
cases titled as “Sajjan Solangi v. The State” (2019 SCMR 872) and 
“Naveed Asghar and 2 others v. The State” (PLD 2021 SC 600).  
20. 
   So far as recovery of pistol (P1) at the pointation of the 
appellant from his residential house taken into possession through 
seizure memo (Exh.PC) by Sakhawat Ali, SI/I.O (PW.13) and 
positive report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore 
(Exh.PCC) are concerned, I have noted that the investigating officer 
while effecting the recovery from the possession of appellant has 
not associated any witness of vicinity, which makes the recovery of 
pistol at the instance of the appellant highly doubtful.  Reliance is 
placed upon the case law titled as “Muhammad Ismail and others v. 
The State” (2017 SCMR 898). 
I have further observed that the occurrence took place on 
27.02.2013 whereas the recovery of pistol (P1) was effected vide 
possession memo (Exh.PC) on 08.12.2013 i.e. nine months and nine 
days after the occurrence, however, the fact would not appeal to any 
prudent mind that once the appellant decided to conceal the weapon, 
then there is no point that he would keep the same in his house in 
such safe custody so as to get recover the same at a subsequent point 
of time as a souvenir. Reliance can be placed on the case law titled 
as “Basharat and another v. The State” (1995 SCMR 1735). 
As I have already disbelieved the ocular account in supra 
mentioned paragraphs of this judgment, therefore, recovery of pistol 
(P1) at the pointation of appellant is of no avail to the prosecution 

Crl. Appeal No.95-J of 2016 & 
Crl. Revision No.172 of 2016 
 
21
because the recovery of weapon of offence is only a corroborative 
piece of evidence and it is settled proposition of law that unless 
direct or substantive evidence is brought on record, a conviction 
cannot be recorded on the basis of such evidence, howsoever 
convincing it may be. Reliance is placed upon the cases titled as 
“Muhammad Irshad v. Allah Ditta and others” (2017 SCMR 142), 
“Muhammad Mansha v. The State” (2018 SCMR 772) and 
“Naveed Asghar and two others v. The State” (PLD 2021 SC 600), 
in paragraph No.29 of which the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan has held as under:- 
“29. Even otherwise, recovery of weapon of offence is 
only a corroborative piece of evidence; and in absence of 
substantive evidence, it is not considered sufficient to 
hold the accused person guilty of the offence charged. 
When substantive evidence fails to connect the accused 
person with the commission of offence or is disbelieved, 
corroborative evidence is of no help to the prosecution as 
the corroborative evidence cannot by itself prove the 
prosecution case." 
21. 
   Epitome of the above comprehensive discussion is that the 
prosecution has failed to prove its case against the appellant 
beyond the shadow of doubt rather the shadows of doubt are 
looming in this case. It is a well-established principle of 
administration of justice in criminal cases that finding of guilt 
against an accused person cannot be based merely on the high 
probabilities that may be inferred from evidence in a given case. 
The finding as regards his guilt should be rested surely and firmly 
on the evidence produced in the case and the plain inferences of 
guilt that may irresistibly be drawn from that evidence. Mere 
conjectures and probabilities cannot take the place of proof. If a 
case is decided merely on high probabilities regarding the 
existence or non-existence of a fact to prove the guilt of a person, 
the golden rule of giving "benefit of doubt" to an accused person, 
which has been a dominant feature of the administration of 
criminal justice in this country with the consistent approval of the 
Constitutional Courts, will be reduced to a naught. The 

Crl. Appeal No.95-J of 2016 & 
Crl. Revision No.172 of 2016 
 
22
prosecution is under obligation to prove its case against the 
accused person at the standard of proof required in criminal cases, 
beyond reasonable doubt standard, and cannot be said to have 
discharged this obligation by producing evidence that merely 
meets the preponderance of probability. If the prosecution fails to 
discharge its said obligation and there remains a reasonable doubt, 
not an imaginary or artificial doubt, as to the guilt of the accused 
person, the benefit of that doubt is to be given to the accused 
person as of right, not as of concession. Reference is made to the 
cases titled “Mst. Asia Bibi v. The State and others” (PLD 2019 SC 
64), “Najaf Ali Shah v. The State” (2021 SCMR 736), “Sajjad 
Hussain v. The State and others” (2022 SCMR 1540) and 
“Tajamal Hussain Shah v. The State and another” (2022 SCMR 
1567). 
22. 
For the foregoing reasons, Criminal Appeal No.95-J of 2016 
filed by Muhammad Imran alias Amanat Ali alias Maani (appellant) 
is accepted, convictions and sentences awarded to him vide 
judgment dated 17.03.2016 passed by the learned trial court is set 
aside and he is acquitted of the charge leveled against him while 
extending the benefit of doubt in his favour. He shall be released 
from jail forthwith if not required to be kept therein in connection 
with any other case.  
23.     In light of above findings, Criminal Revision No.172 of 2016 
filed by the complainant for enhancement of sentences of respondent 
No.1 (appellant) is hereby dismissed.
