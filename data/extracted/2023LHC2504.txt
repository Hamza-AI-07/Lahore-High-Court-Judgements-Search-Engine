ABID AZIZ SHEIKH, J. Through this Constitutional 
Petition, the petitioner has challenged two impugned transfer 
orders bearing Endorsement Nos.LDA/ADMN/S-I/242 & 243 
dated 27.03.2023 (impugned transfer orders) issued by 
respondent No.4 on behalf of Director General (DG), Lahore 
Development Authority (LDA), whereby the petitioner (who 

(-2-) 
W.P. No.26698 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
was working as Chief Engineer-II, Urban Development (UD) 
Wing, LDA and holding additional charge of the post of Chief 
Engineer, Traffic Engineering & Transport Planning Agency 
(TEPA), LDA) (hereinafter referred to as Chief Engineer 
TEPA) has been transferred and posted as Chief Engineer, 
TEPA, LDA and through the second impugned transfer order, 
respondent No.6, already working as Chief Engineer-I, UD 
Wing, LDA, (hereinafter referred to as Chief Engineer-I) has 
been given the additional charge of the post of Chief Engineer-
II, UD Wing LDA (hereinafter referred to as Chief Engineer-
II). The petitioner has also challenged the order dated 
07.04.2023 (impugned order) passed by respondent No.2, 
whereby his representation has been dismissed. 
2. 
Relevant facts are that the LDA, under the chairmanship 
of Chief Minister, Punjab held its meeting on 17.08.2021 and 
decided to upgrade the existing post of Additional Chief 
Engineer in UD Wing, LDA from BS-19 to BS-20 and re-
designate the same as Chief Engineer-II (BS-20), similarly, the 
existing post of Chief Engineer in UD Wing of the LDA was 
decided to re-designate as Chief Engineer-I (BS-20). 
Subsequently, vide order dated 04.10.2021, the respondent 
No.6 was posted as Chief Engineer-I and the petitioner was 
posted as Chief Engineer-II and the workload was distributed 

(-3-) 
W.P. No.26698 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
accordingly. Through the impugned transfer orders, the 
petitioner has been transferred as Chief Engineer TEPA and 
respondent No.6 has been given additional charge of the post of 
Chief Engineer-II, respectively. The petitioner being aggrieved 
filed Writ Petition No.21132/2023, which was disposed of by 
this Court on 31.03.2023 with direction to respondent No.2 to 
decide the representation/appeal of the petitioner under 
Regulation 23(2) of the Lahore Development Authority 
(Appointment & Conditions of Service) Regulations, 1978 
(Regulations), however, the said representation of the 
petitioner has been dismissed through the impugned order dated 
07.04.2023, hence, this Constitutional Petition. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the 
petitioner is Grade-19 officer, however, he was posted against 
the post of Chief Engineer-II, which is a post of Grade-20, 
therefore, under Schedule “A” read with Regulation 3 of the 
Regulations, the jurisdiction to transfer the petitioner is with the 
Chief Minister (who is the Chairman of LDA) and not with the 
DG, LDA. He further submits that under Section 8(2)(b) read 
with Section 10 of the Lahore Development Authority Act, 
1975 (Act), the Authority issued “Delegation of Powers 
Circular” (hereinafter referred to as Circular), whereby certain 
powers are delegated to DG, LDA and under Clause 19 thereof, 

(-4-) 
W.P. No.26698 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
the powers of DG, LDA to make transfers are confined up to 
Grade-19 and not against the post of Grade-20. He submits that 
Clause 12 of the Circular under the head (“Powers of the 
Authority/The Chairman”), the remaining powers are with the 
Chairman, and therefore the impugned transfer order in respect 
of the petitioner is not valid. He submits that even otherwise, 
the dual charge of the post of Chief Engineer-I and Chief 
Engineer-II could not be given to respondent No.6 being in 
clear violation of the Authority‟s decision dated 17.08.2021. He 
adds that under Section 8(2)(b) of the Act, the DG, LDA is 
bound by the decision of the Authority. Finally, submits that the 
impugned transfer orders have been passed during the ban 
imposed by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), vide 
Notification dated 15th March, 2023 (Notification) and despite 
the letter dated 19.04.2023, issued by District Election 
Commissioner-I, Lahore, the impugned transfer orders have not 
been recalled. He placed reliance on the order dated 
22.02.2023, passed by learned Full Bench of this Court in Writ 
Petition No.6125 of 2023, and “GOVERNMENT OF 
BALOCHISTAN through Secretary Services and General 
Administration Department and others Vs. ABDUL RAUF and 
others”  (PLD 2021 Supreme Court 313). On the question of 
maintainability of this petition, he submits that the Regulations, 

(-5-) 
W.P. No.26698 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
being approved by the Martial Law Administrator, Punjab on 
30.04.1978 and validated by the Article 270A of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
(Constitution), have the force of statutory regulations, hence, 
this Constitutional Petition is maintainable. 
4. 
On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents-
LDA submits that the Regulations being non-statutory, this 
Writ Petition is not maintainable. He submits that the petitioner 
being Grade-19 officer, the jurisdiction for his transfer vests 
with the DG, LDA under Regulation 11(3) of the Regulations. 
He submits that even the earlier transfer order dated 04.10.2021 
of the petitioner was passed by the DG, LDA and not by the 
Chairman. He submits that dual charge given to respondent 
No.6 by the competent Authority is also in accordance with the 
relevant Rules and Regulations. He submits that though there 
was ban imposed by the ECP through the Notification on the 
transfer and posting but the said ban is not applicable to the 
LDA. He adds that this ground is not specifically raised in writ 
petition and in any case, the LDA filed application to the ECP 
on 28.04.2023 for ex-post facto approval of the transfers in-
question, which is likely to be granted, therefore, Writ Petition 
is not maintainable. He further submits that it is the Authority, 
who can determine that whether the services of any staff 

(-6-) 
W.P. No.26698 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
member of LDA is required, therefore, the Writ Petition is not 
maintainable in respect of the transfer matters. He placed 
reliance on “KHYBER MEDICAL UNIVERSITY and others Vs. 
AIMAL KHAN and others” (PLD 2022 Supreme Court 92) 
and 
“MUHAMMAD 
SAJJAD 
Vs. 
FEDERATION 
OF 
PAKISTAN and others” (2023 PLC (C.S.) 292). Learned 
counsel for the respondent No.6 supported the above arguments 
and submits that respondent No.6 is Grade-19 officer and 
performing his duties diligently and for this reason, he has been 
lawfully assigned dual charge of the post of Chief Engineer-II 
through the second impugned transfer order. 
5. 
Learned counsel for the respondent-ECP, however, 
submits that the impugned transfer orders have been made 
without approval of the ECP, which are not sustainable. 
6. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. Before touching 
merits of the case, I would like to decide the question of 
maintainability of this petition on the legal question i.e. whether 
the LDA Regulations are statutory or non-statutory. One of the 
tests to determine that whether the Rules or Regulations under 
any enactment are statutory or otherwise, laid down by the 
hon‟ble Supreme Court from time to time, is that when the 
Rules or Regulations are framed or approved by the 

(-7-) 
W.P. No.26698 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
Government then the same have force of law and are statutory 
in nature, however, where the Rules or Regulations are made by 
the Authority or concerned department for internal control or 
management without approval of the Government, the same are 
non-statutory and does not have statutory force behind it. In this 
context, reliance is placed on “ZARAI TARAQIATI BANK 
LIMITED and others Vs. SAID REHMAN and others” (2013 
SCMR 642), “PROVINCE OF PUNJAB through Collector 
Sialkot and others Vs. RANA ZILADAR KHAN” (2013 SCMR 
219), “KAMRAN KHAN Vs. WAPDA etc.” (2014 PLC (C.S.) 
332 Lahore) and “MUHAMMAD FAHAD MALIK Vs. 
PAKISTAN MEDICAL AND DENTAL COUNCIL and others” 
(PLD 2018 Lahore 75).  
7. 
The Regulations in-question when examined in the light 
of the law settled in afore-noted judgments, no doubt the same 
have been framed under Section 45 of the Act by the Authority 
and no approval of the Government is required under said 
provision, however, the perusal of LDA Regulations shows that 
vide letter dated 30.04.1978 by government of Punjab (Local 
Government 
Social 
Welfare 
and 
Rural 
Development 
Department), the same were approved by the Martial Law 
Administrator, Punjab (MLA) on 16.04.1978. Under Article 
270A(1) of the Constitution, all Proclamations, President‟s 

(-8-) 
W.P. No.26698 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
orders, Ordinances, Martial Law Regulations, Martial Law 
Orders and all other laws made between 05.07.1977 and the 
date when Article 270A of the Constitution came into force, 
were affirmed, adopted and declared to have been validly made 
by the competent authority. Further, under Article 270A(2) & 
(3) of the Constitution, all orders made, proceedings taken and 
act done by any authority or any person which was made, taken 
or done between 05.07.1977 and the date on which Article 
270A of the Constitution came into force (30.01.1985), in 
exercise of powers derived from Proclamation, President‟s 
Orders, Ordinance, Martial Law Regulations, Martial Law 
Orders, enactments Notifications, Rules, Orders or Byelaws be 
deemed to be and always to have been validly made, taken or 
done and remain in force unless altered, repealed or amended 
by the competent authority. The hon‟ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in “Miss BENAZIR BHUTTO Vs. FEDERATION OF 
PAKISTAN and another” (PLD 1988 Supreme Court 416), 
while interpreting the Article 270A of the Constitution, held as 
under:- 
“Having regard to the meanings which the 
words “affirm”, “adopt” and “declare” 
convey, it is manifest that the legislature owned 
the legal instruments and legal measures made 
between the specified dates as if enacted by 
itself so as to give validity and competency to 
those legal instruments and measures. The 

(-9-) 
W.P. No.26698 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
principle of ratification was here adopted and 
such validity and competency was proclaimed. 
This principle belongs to the realm of the law of 
agency: “In the law of principal and agent, the 
adoption and confirmation by one person with 
knowledge of all material facts, of an act or 
contract performed or entered into in his behalf 
by another who at the time assumed without 
authority to act as his agent. Essence of 
“ratification” by principal of act of agent is 
manifestation of mental determination by 
principal to affirm the act, and this may be 
manifested by written word …” (See Black’s 
Law Dictionary, Fifth Edition, p.1135). In this 
respect there was a departure from the 
protection 
earlier 
given 
by 
the 
two 
constitutional provisions, namely Article 281(1) 
of the Interim Constitution and Article 269(1) of 
the 1973 Constitution.” 
 
Though the LDA Regulations framed under Section 45 of the 
Act were neither required nor approved by the Government, 
however, these Regulations were approved by the MLA on 
16.04.1978, who was exercising the powers of the Provincial 
Government for all intent and purposes under Proclamations, 
including the Martial Law Regulations and Martial Law Orders, 
which were subsequently validated under Article 270A of the 
Constitution, therefore, the approval of MLA has the same 
status as approval of the Government. The necessary corollary 
and conclusion of the above discussion is that LDA Regulations 
are statutory in nature and it will be a fallacy to hold it 
otherwise. The impugned transfer orders are also challenged 

(-10-) 
W.P. No.26698 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
being violative of the decision of the Authority dated 
17.08.2021, ECP order dated 15.03.2023 and the provisions of 
the Act, therefore, this petition is  maintainable on this score as 
well. In view of above discussion, the preliminary objection on 
the maintainability of this petition is overruled.  
8. 
On merits, under regulation 11(3) of the Regulations, the 
DG, LDA may transfer any employee from the Authority to any 
of its Agencies and vice versa against equivalent posts. The 
petitioner is admittedly an employee of the LDA and has been 
transferred as Chief Engineer in TEPA, which is one of the 
Agencies of the Authority. The perusal of the earlier posting 
order dated 04.10.2021 of the petitioner shows that the same 
was also issued with the approval of the DG, LDA, therefore, it 
cannot be said that DG, LDA has no jurisdiction to pass the 
impugned transfer orders under the Regulations. The argument 
of the petitioner that authority to pass transfer orders under 
Schedule “A” of the Regulations and Clause 12 & 19 of the 
Circular is with the Chairman, LDA, is misconceived. The 
perusal of Schedule “A” issued under Regulation 3 of the 
Regulations shows that the Chairman is the Appointing 
Authority for Grade-20 officers, whereas the petitioner and 
respondent No.6 are admittedly Grade-19 officers, in respect of 
whom the Appointing/Competent Authority is the DG, LDA 

(-11-) 
W.P. No.26698 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
under the said Schedule “A”. Similarly, Clause 19 of the 
Circular (under the head “Powers of DG”) power to transfer 
posts in Grade 17, 18 & 19 vests with the DG, LDA. Mere fact 
that posts of Chief Engineers I & II were upgraded to BS-20 
will not exclude the jurisdiction of DG, LDA in respect of the 
petitioner and respondent No.6, who are admittedly Grade-19 
officers. Therefore, the argument that DG, LDA had no 
jurisdiction to transfer the petitioner has no force. 
9. 
Notwithstanding the above legal position, I found 
substance in the argument of the petitioner that the impugned 
transfer orders have been passed in violation of the Notification 
dated 15.03.2023 by the ECP, whereby ban was imposed on 
transfers and postings in the Punjab Province where schedule 
for General Election to the Provincial Assembly was issued on 
08th March, 2023 till the publication of the names of the 
returned candidates in the official Gazette. The argument of the 
respondents-LDA that this ground has not been raised in the 
petition or the ECP‟s Notification is not applicable to LDA, is 
baseless. Perusal of Para 2(ii) of this Writ Petition shows that 
not only this legal question has been specifically raised in the 
petition but the copy of ECP‟s Notification dated 15.03.2023 is 
also appended with the petition as „Annexure-B‟. Regarding 
applicability, the perusal of the ECP‟s Notification manifests 

(-12-) 
W.P. No.26698 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
that same was issued under Article 218(3) of the Constitution 
read with Section 230(2)(f) of the Elections Act, 2017 
(Elections Act) and was made applicable not only to the 
Government but also to the Authorities. The LDA admittedly 
being an Authority under the Act, the ECP‟s Notification is also 
applicable to the LDA. This legal position is also supported by 
the fact that District Election Commissioner-I, Lahore 
specifically wrote a letter dated 19.04.2023 to DG, LDA to 
withdraw the impugned transfer orders being in violation of the 
direction of ECP. Further, the respondents-LDA itself, vide 
letter dated 28.04.2023, sought ex-post fact approval for the 
transfer of the petitioner under the letter dated 15.03.2023 and it 
is nowhere claimed in the said letter that ECP‟s Notification is 
not applicable to LDA. In view of above discussion, the 
impugned transfer orders, in respect of the petitioner and 
respondent No.6, being violative of ECP‟s Notification dated 
15.03.2023, are not sustainable.  
10. 
The petitioner has also challenged the impugned transfer 
order dated 27.03.2023, whereby additional charge of the post 
of Chief Engineer-II was given to respondent No.6 being in 
violation of the direction of the Authority dated 17.08.2021. I 
have carefully examined this argument. The perusal of the 
Minutes of meeting of the Authority dated 17.08.2021 shows 

(-13-) 
W.P. No.26698 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
that the Authority decided to upgrade the existing post of 
Additional Chief Engineer in UD Wing, LDA from BS-19 to 
BS-20 and re-designation of the same as Chief Engineer-II (BS-
20) LDA, similarly, it was decided to re-designate the existing 
post of Chief Engineer in UD Wing of the LDA as Chief 
Engineer-I (BS-20), LDA and specific direction was also issued 
to DG, LDA to distribute the workload amongst the Chief 
Engineer-I and Chief Engineer-II as may, from time to time, be 
deemed appropriate by him and may take all consequential 
actions reasonable necessary thereon. The aforesaid decision of 
the Authority is binding on DG, LDA under Section 8(2)(b) of 
the Act, therefore, the DG, LDA was required to distribute the 
workload amongst the Chief Engineer-I and Chief Engineer-II 
and could not give additional charge of the post of Chief 
Engineer-II to respondent No.6, who was already working as 
Chief Engineer-I. The said charge of Chief Engineer-II was 
required to be assigned to some other eligible officer to 
distribute the workload between the two posts as per the 
direction of the Authority.  
11. 
There is no cavil with the settled proposition of law that 
transfer and posting is the domain of the department for 
exigencies of the service, however, where the transfer orders 
are in clear violation of the orders passed by the ECP or 

(-14-) 
W.P. No.26698 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
Authority itself, then the same are not sustainable. The case law 
relied upon by the learned counsel for the respondents-LDA is 
distinguishable 
and 
not 
applicable 
to 
the 
facts 
and 
circumstances of this case. 
12. 
In view of the above discussion, this Writ Petition is 
allowed and the impugned transfer orders of even date i.e. 
27.03.2023 in respect of the petitioner and respondent No.6, 
alongwith the impugned order dated 07.04.2023 are set-aside 
being passed without lawful authority and of no legal effect.
