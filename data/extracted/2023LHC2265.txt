For the Petitioner 
Mr. Zahoor Nasir Tagga, Advocate. 
 
For Respondent No.2 
 
Mr. A.D. Shahid, Advocate. 
 
Raheel Kamran J:- The petitioner has assailed the order dated 
06.02.2021 passed by the learned Senior Civil Judge (Family Division), 
Khanewal whereby application of the petitioner for setting aside ex-
parte judgment and decree dated 12.10.2019 was dismissed. 
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the impugned 
order has been passed erroneously in disregard of the fact that 
respondent No.2-Ghulam Abbas filed a petition for custody of minor on 
23.10.2017 before the learned Guardian Court at Shorkot disclosing 
address of the petitioner as Tehsil Shorkot District Jhang and on 
account of non-prosecution, the same was consigned to record with 
permission to seek revival thereof, as manifest from the order dated 
08.05.2018. He adds that another application, concealing the earlier 
one, was filed before the Guardian Court at Khanewal on 03.10.2018 
while showing the petitioner to be resident of District Khanewal. He 
maintains that second application on the same subject was not 
maintainable. He emphasizes that in any event the ex-parte judgment 
and decree obtained by respondent No.2 was result of fraud, 
misrepresentation and concealment of facts and the petitioner had no 
knowledge of proceedings as summons were never personally served 

2 
Writ Petition No.81201 of 2022 
 
 
 
upon her, therefore, the same was liable to be set aside. He further 
contends that in his application for the execution of decree, respondent 
No.2 has once again mentioned address of the petitioner to be resident 
of Shorkot. Claims that after abandoning the child at the age of four 
months, respondent No.2 took little interest in the welfare of the minor 
and never paid a single rupee towards the same until he moved an 
application for custody of the minor when she attained the age of six 
years. 
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for respondent No.2 supports the 
impugned order for reasons stated therein. He maintains that previously 
filed application for custody of minor was dismissed for non-
prosecution, therefore, there was no bar against institution of fresh one 
by the said respondent. He adds that the petitioner got married with one 
Hassan Iqbal on 04.08.2018 whereafter she moved to reside with in-
laws in Khanewal, therefore, in the second application for custody of 
minor address of the petitioner was stated to be one mentioned on 
Marriage Registration Certificate of the petitioner. He further contends 
that in the application for execution of the decree, passed by the 
Guardian Court, Khanewal address of the petitioner was specified to be 
that of Shorkot for the reason that she entered into third marriage with 
one Abdur Rauf on 03.02.2019 who has been residing in village Haveli 
Bahadur Shah Sharqi, Tehsil Shorkot and her residential address was 
changed once again. He emphasized that the ex-parte judgment and 
decree dated 12.10.2019 was passed in accordance with law after 
service of the process, therefore, application of the petitioner for setting 
aside the same has been rightly rejected.  
4. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
5. 
The matter in hand relates to custody of the minor namely Tahira 
Mai, the decision whereupon, as for as practicable, must be made on 
merit on the basis of her welfare being paramount consideration in law. 
Reliance in this regard is placed on judgment of the Apex Court in the 
cases of Sardar Hussain and others v. Mst. Parveen Umer and others 

3 
Writ Petition No.81201 of 2022 
 
 
 
(PLD 2004 SC 357), Mst. Razia Bibi v. Riaz Ahmad and another (2004 
SCMR 821) and Mirajam Aberras Lehdeaho v. SHO, Police Station 
Chung, Lahore and others (2018 SCMR 427). In the absence of proper 
service and adequate opportunity of hearing granted to both sides, any 
determination of welfare of the minor cannot be termed as lawful and 
satisfying the requirement of fundamental right to fair trial as 
guaranteed under Article 10A of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973. Reliance in this regard is placed on judgment of this 
Court in the case of Yaqoob Ali through LRs and others v. Muhammad 
Ayub and others (PLD 2021 Lahore 678).  
6. 
 When it was claimed that the petitioner was not personally 
served nor she had any knowledge of the proceedings qua custody of 
the minor at Khanewal, the primary controversy for the Court in the 
petitioner’s application for setting aside the ex-parte decree dated 
12.10.2019 was whether the judgment debtor was served in accordance 
with law before such decree was passed against her. Without framing 
issues and recording evidence, the Court below has decided the factual 
controversy qua residential address of the petitioner while relying on 
photocopy of the petitioner’s alleged second marriage in Khanewal 
district, produced by the counsel for respondent No.2. The Court below 
has also presumed petitioner’s knowledge of proceedings and service of 
summons on the basis that notice alongwith registered envelope AD 
were sent on her Khanewal address and that notice was also published 
in the newspaper daily “Dunya”, Multan.  
7. 
Undeniably, neither the process server was produced as a witness 
in the instant case to establish personal service of summons under 
Section 8 of the Family Courts Act, 1964 upon the petitioner in 
accordance with law nor any reference to his report to the said effect 
has been made in the impugned order as well as the judgment and 
decree sought to be reviewed. Furthermore, in the absence of any 
acknowledgment due available on record, service of the notice has been 
presumed by the Court below merely on the basis of postal receipt 

4 
Writ Petition No.81201 of 2022 
 
 
 
available on record. Without establishing on record that the petitioner 
could not be served personally, reliance on publication of the notice 
could not be considered safe to presume service of the petitioner, 
particularly when respondent No.2 himself alleged in his petition for 
custody that she was an illiterate villager. Reliance in this regard is 
placed on judgments in the cases of Ahmed Khan v. Haji Muhammad 
Qassim and others (2002 SCMR 664), Mehr Din through Legal Heirs 
v. Azizan and another (1994 SCMR 1110), Pehalwan Khan v. Mrs. 
Najma Mujtaba (1986 CLC 1735) and Muhammad Asghar and others 
v. Qamar Din (PLD 2005 Lahore 240).  
8. 
For the foregoing reasons, the titled petition is allowed, the 
impugned order dated 06.02.2021 passed by the Senior Civil Judge 
(Family Division), Khanewal is set aside and application of the 
petitioner for setting aside the ex-parte judgment and decree dated 
12.10.2019 is allowed and resultantly application of respondent No.2 
under Section 25 of the Guardian and Wards Act, 1890 for custody of 
the minor Tahira Mai shall be deemed to be pending for decision afresh 
in accordance with law. Additionally, in exercise of powers conferred 
by Section 25A of the Family Courts Act, 1964 the aforementioned 
proceedings are hereby ordered to be transferred to the Family Court, 
Tehsil Shorkot District Jhang from the Court of Senior Civil Judge 
(Family Division), District Khanewal.
