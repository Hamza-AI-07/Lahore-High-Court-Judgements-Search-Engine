In order to deprive a defendant of his recourse to arbitration a “step in the 
proceedings” must be one which impliedly affirms the correctness of the proceedings 
and the willingness of the defendant to go along with a determination by the Courts of 
law instead of arbitration. 
 
Lord Denning MR in Eagle Star Insurance Co Ltd v Yuval Insurance Co Ltd [1978] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 357 
 
  
JAWAD HASSAN, J. The Appellant filed this First Appeal 
under Section 39 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 (the “Act”) against order 
dated 22.07.2023 whereby learned Civil Judge 1st Class, Rawalpindi, 
proceeded to dismiss his application under Section 34 of the “Act”. 
This judgment will decide the issue of stepping into proceedings in 
connection with application under aforementioned Section 34 of the 
“Act” in a suit pending between the parties before the civil Court 
where there is exclusive written agreement between the parties with 
specific arbitration clause. The Court will also determine the test laid 
down by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in numerous judgments as the 
Civil Court has dismissed the application for stay of proceedings under 
Section 34 of the “Act”, which will eventuate in creating hindrance in

promoting the ADR in Pakistan and building its ecosystem in context 
to the global development in ADR. It is the duty of the Courts to 
promote ADR by way of developing the confidence of the parties to 
adopt ADR without lengthy litigation before the Courts, which practice 
would definitely strengthen the ecosystem of ADR to promote foreign 
investment in Pakistan. The Courts and the ADR have symbiotic 
relationship with critical interdependence as the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in various judgments has emphasized upon strengthening of 
ADR, arbitration and mediation and has settled the principles that there 
should be minimal interference by the Courts in such process to make 
way for speedy, amicable, efficacious and expeditious resolution of 
arbitrable disputes. In this case, instead of referring the matter to 
arbitration, the Civil Court dismissed the stay application under 
Section 34 of the “Act” without any solid and justified reasons.    
I. 
CONTEXT 
2. 
The Appellant and the Respondent No.1 are real brothers  
inter se and partners in the business of manufacturing and sales of 
wood furniture under the name and style of M/s Unique Wood 
Working Company duly incorporated and registered under the 
Partnership Act, 1932 with Registrar of Firms, Rawalpindi by virtue of 
a partnership deed dated 15.06.1983 executed between them which 
was later on changed/altered firstly on 07.01.2012 and then on 
07.09.2021, respectively. The initial partnership deed dated 15.06.1983 
had a dispute settlement clause i.e. Clause No.9 to which extent no 
change/alteration was made in the subsequent partnership deeds. The 
said Clause reads as follows: 
“9. 
That in the event of any dispute arising 
among the parties the matter shall be referred 
to any arbitrator appointed with the mutual 
consent of all the partners and his decision 
shall be binding on all of them.” 
 
II. 
PROCEEDINGS IN TRIAL COURT 
3. 
On 19.05.2023, a dispute arose between the parties which 
prompted the Respondent No.1 to file a suit for dissolution of initial 
partnership deed dated 15.06.1983, rendition of accounts, recovery of

       3 
amount and mesne profit damages and permanent injunction, wherein 
the Appellant appeared and filed memo of appearance on 08.06.2023 
and the trial Court passed following order:

On 24.06.2023, learned counsel for the Appellant filed power

On 06.07.2023, the counsel for the Appellant sought an

Court passed following order:

Meanwhile, the Appellant filed an Application under Section 34 
of the Act, whereupon the learned trial Court, after hearing the Parties, 
passed the impugned order dated 22.07.2023, operative part of which 
is as follows: 
7. 
This court seeks clear guidance from 
above referred judgment that, had the 

F.A.O.No.88 of 2023 
 
       4 
defendants intending for an arbitration 
settlement, they might had filed application 
under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 
1940 at the earliest or at first opportunity 
but they filed same after availing couple of 
adjournments and that too for filing of 
written statement. For these reasons, the 
plea taken by the defendant No.1 is repelled 
and consequently application u/s 34 of the 
Arbitration Act, 1940, preferred by the 
defendant No.1 stands dismissed. 
8. 
As 
discussed 
above, 
ample 
opportunities has been granted to defendant 
No.1 for filing of written statement/written 
reply. Stipulated period as provided under 
Civil Procedure Code, 1908 has also been 
elapsed. Therefore, right of defendant No.1 
for filing written statement/written reply 
stands struck off.  … ” 
 
  
Hence this appeal under Section 39 of the “Act”.  
 
III. 
APPELLANT’S SUBMISSIONS 
5. 
Qazi M. Waqas Arif, Advocate inter alia argued that the 
Appellant never ever stepped into the proceedings of the main suit 
before the learned trial Court, rather he filed application under Section 
34 of the “Act”, which was wrongly dismissed vide impugned order; 
that on 08.06.2023, learned Presiding Officer concerned was on leave 
for some departmental course and learned counsel for Appellant whilst 
appearing in Court informed the Court Reader that the Appellant was 
inclined to file an Application under Section 34 of the “Act” for 
staying the proceedings of the suit and referring the matter to the 
arbitrator but despite that the case was adjourned to 24.06.2023 for 
filing of written statement; that on fixed date, the learned Presiding 
Officer was again on casual leave, therefore, learned counsel for 
Appellant placed the Application before the Court Reader, which was 
not taken on record and the case was adjourned to 06.07.2023; that on 
06.07.2023, learned counsel for Appellant filed aforesaid Application 
under Section 34 of the “Act” but the learned trial Court refused to 
accept the same on the pretext that the case was fixed for filing of 
written statement and adjourned it for 22.07.2023; that on 22.07.2023, 

F.A.O.No.88 of 2023 
 
       5 
the Appellant again submitted aforesaid application, which was 
wrongly dismissed vide impugned order. Learned counsel for the 
Appellant has vehemently agitated that the Court while passing the 
impugned order dated 22.07.2023 did not probe into the main issue; 
that arbitrary powers were used by the Presiding Officer concerned and 
his Reader for insisting the Appellant to file written statement despite 
of the fact that the Appellant repeatedly tried to submit his Application 
under Section 34 of the “Act”; that the learned trial Court has ignored 
the aforesaid material facts and objections raised by the Appellant. 
Lastly, in support of his arguments, he has placed reliance on the 
judgments reported as “Pakistan International Airlines Corporation 
versus Messrs Pak Saaf Dry Cleaners” (PLD 1981 SC 553), “Pakistan 
Stone Development Company Limited through Chief Executive Officer 
v. Muhammad Yousaf and another” (2018 CLC 877), “Province of 
Punjab through Secretary to Government of Punjab, Communication 
and Works Department and 4 others” (1986 CLC 2800) and “MD. 
ESACK v. Raja Miah and another” (PLD 1969 Dacca 719).  
IV. 
RESPONDENTS’ SUBMISSIONS 
6. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the Respondents Mr. Sameed 
Khalid, Advocate refuted the arguments of learned counsel for the 
Appellant while submitting that it is well settled principle of law that 
seeking even a single adjournment amounts to “stepping in 
proceedings” and in this case the Appellant obtained consecutive three 
(03) adjournments, hence, he stepped into the proceedings of the suit, 
therefore, his Application under Section 34 of the “Act” was rightly 
dismissed. He added that the learned trial Court while passing the 
impugned order has rightly observed that Application to stay legal 
proceedings should have been filed before taking any further steps in 
proceedings, that too, at the earliest possible opportunity. He has 
submitted that impugned order has been passed in accordance law. In 
support of his contentions, he has relied on the judgments reported as 
“Muhammad Farooq v. Nazir Ahmad and others” (PLD 2006 SC 
196), “Muhammad Ilyas Khokhar versus Ihsan Ilahi Mughal” (2000 
CLC 206), “Muneer Flour Mills (Private) Limited and 4 others v. 

F.A.O.No.88 of 2023 
 
       6 
National Bank of Pakistan through Chief Manager and 2 others” 
(2005 CLD 1019), “Government of the Punjab and others v. Messrs 
Muhammad Asad & Co.” (2021 CLC 2135), “Aftab Ahmad Khan and 
another v. Wazir Ahmad and 4 others” (2014 CLC 1401), “Union of 
India, Applicant v. Girish Ghandra and others, Opposite Party” (AIR 
1953 ALL. 149 (Vol.40, C.N. 66) (LUKHNOW BENCH), “Abdul 
Quddoos Dost Mohammad Momin and another, Plaintiffs-Appellants 
v. Abdul Ghani Abdul Rahman and another, Defendants-Respondents” 
(AIR 1954 NAGPUR 332) (Vol. 41, C. N. 115) 
7. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
V. 
DETERMINATION BY THE COURT 
 
8. 
In order to resolve the issue in hand, the only moot point 
requiring adjudication is whether request for adjournment and filing of 
power of attorney or Application under Section 34 of the Act, without 
filing anything else amounts to “stepping into proceeding”. Before 
proceeding further, it would be advantageous to reproduce Section 34 
of the “Act” dealing with the matter in hand which reads as: 
 “34. Power to stay legal proceedings where 
there is an arbitration agreement.- Where any 
party to an arbitration agreement or any 
person claiming under him commences any 
legal proceedings against any other party to 
the agreement or any person claiming under 
him in respect of any matter agreed to be 
referred, any party to such legal proceedings 
may, at any time before filing a written 
statement or taking any other steps in the 
proceedings, apply to the judicial authority 
before which the proceedings are pending to 
stay the proceedings; and if satisfied that there 
is no sufficient reason why the matter should 
not be referred in accordance with arbitration 
agreement and that the applicant was, at the 
time when the proceedings were commenced, 
and still remains, ready and willing to do all 
things necessary to the property conduct of the 
arbitration, such authority may make an order 
staying the proceedings.” 
 
  
Plain reading of above provision of law makes clear the 
concept of “step in proceedings” which requires to display 

F.A.O.No.88 of 2023 
 
       7 
unequivocal intention to proceed with the suit and to abdicate right to 
have matter disposed of through arbitration.  
 
VI. 
ACT FALLING IN AMBIT OF “ANY OTHER STEP 
INTO PROCEEDINGS” 
 
10. 
It is important to mention here that to ascertain “any other 
step into proceedings” and “not step into proceedings” falling in 
domain of Section 34 of the “Act”, there are pro and contra views 
determined, opined and observed by the Courts. However, 
undoubtedly, plain reading of above reproduced Section 34 of the 
“Act” makes it abundantly clear, that if in a contract, there is 
provision of resolution of dispute between the parties by way of 
arbitration, and parties have agreed to such forum, then such forum is 
to be resorted to and given preference over filing of suit. If one of the 
parties to the contract by-passing forum of arbitration files a suit, then 
the other party can file application for stay as contemplated under 
section 34 of the “Act” and if the Court is satisfied then order for stay 
of proceedings in the suit can be passed to enable resolution of dispute 
between the parties by way of arbitration only. Conditions precedent 
for application under Section 34 of the Act are that the party applying 
for stay has not filed written statement or taken “any other steps in the 
proceedings” indicating that right to invoke arbitration clause is 
intentionally abandoned in favour of Court proceedings. Whether to 
grant stay or not is dependent upon satisfaction of the Court and such 
order is to be passed by the Court only when it is satisfied that all the 
requirements and preconditions enumerated have been fulfilled. 
However, the Court has to necessarily satisfy itself that the party 
applying for stay has not relinquished or abandoned his right of 
invoking arbitration clause after filing of suit. In coming to such 
conclusion the facts and circumstances of each particular case are to 
be examined in the light of pleas and other steps taken by the parties. 
11. 
The primary duty of a Court is to look into the facts of the case 
fairly and squarely and then to decide whether the conduct of the 
applicant is such as would amount to a participation in the suit itself or 

F.A.O.No.88 of 2023 
 
       8 
an indication of acquiescence in its proceedings. If so, an application 
under Section 34 of the “Act” would be barred for the simple reason 
that a party is not allowed to ask for staying the proceeding when he 
has clearly and willingly participated in them in a manner which can 
be construed acquiescence therein. If his conduct is such as would 
indicate that he has acquiesced in the suit, he is shut out from claiming 
the benefit of the Section 34 of the said Act. The law required that the 
conduct of the Appellant, in order to be termed as “a step in the 
proceedings” should have been such as would manifestly display an 
unequivocal intention to proceed with the suit and give up the right to 
have the matter disposed of by arbitration. In this connection, the 
proceedings of the suit reproduced above depict that Appellant had 
joined Court proceedings on 08.06.2023, when the Presiding Officer 
was not available on account of some departmental training and on 
very next date on 24.06.2023 again the Presiding Officer concerned 
was on casual leave, whereas next order dated 06.07.2023 reflects the 
only adjournment granted by the Trial Court itself on request of the 
Appellant for filing of written statement. In such like situation, it has 
been held in the judgment cited as “Messrs SGEC-AMC JV through 
Authorized Officer Vs. National Highway Authority through 
Chairman” (2024 CLD 301) that “a single adjournment granted by 
the Court in routine, requiring the defendant to file a power of 
attorney and/or the written statement cannot be termed as 'a step in 
the proceedings'.” Moreover, it is observed in case “BNP (Pvt.) 
Limited Vs. Collier International Pakistan (Pvt.) Limited” (2016 CLC 
1772) that “a single adjournment granted by the Court in routine, 
requiring the defendant to file a power of attorney and a written 
statement cannot be termed as 'a step in the proceedings'.” 
12. 
Though a two (02) member Bench of the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the peculiar circumstances of the case “Muhammad 
Farooq Vs. Nazir Ahmad and others” (PLD 2006 S.C 196) observed 
that frequent requests for adjournment for filing written statement 
would fall within the purview/ambit of the phrase "taking any other 
steps in the proceedings" within the meaning of Section 34 of the 

F.A.O.No.88 of 2023 
 
       9 
Arbitration Act,  but the provision of the Section 34 of the “Act” was 
beautifully and attractively considered and interpreted by the three 
(03) member Bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the judgment 
reported “Pakistan International Airlines Corporation v. Messrs Pak 
Saaf Dry Cleaners” (PLD 1981 SC 553) (PIA Case), wherein the 
question came into consideration whether an application made for 
adjournment of a case with a view to enable the party to file  written 
statement is to be treated as a matter of law "a step in the 
proceedings". After, exhaustively examining the precedent law the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan has laid down the test for determining 
whether an act is tantamount to a step in the proceedings or not. The 
relevant part of the said judgment is reproduced as under: 
“…In my opinion, the true tests for determining 
whether an act is a step in the proceedings is not 
so much the question as to whether the party 
sought an adjournment for filing the written 
statement although of course that would be a 
satisfactory test in many cases but whether taking 
into consideration the contents of the application 
as well as all the surrounding circumstances that 
led the party to make the application display an 
unequivocal intention to proceed with the suit, 
and to give up the right to' have the matter 
disposed of by arbitration. An application of such 
nature, therefore, should prima facie be construed 
as a step in the proceedings within the meaning of 
section 34, and the whole burden should be upon 
the party to establish why effect should not be 
given to the prima fade meaning of the 
application.” 
 
13. 
Whilst relying upon PIA case mentioned supra, the Islamabad 
High Court in the judgment reported as “Pakistan Stone Development 
Company Limited through Chief Executive Officer v. Muhammad 
Yousaf and another” (2018 CLC 877) rendered by Mr. Justice Athar 
Minallah, (now Judge of Supreme Court of Pakistan)  has held that 
“whether or not a party seeking a stay of the proceedings under 
section 34 of the Act of 1940 has taken steps in the proceedings would 
essentially depend on the facts and circumstances of each particular 
case. The Court, therefore, has to be satisfied on the basis  

F.A.O.No.88 of 2023 
 
       10 
of the facts and circumstances in each case that the conduct of the 
party seeking a stay of the proceedings displays an unequivocal 
intention to proceed with the suit and to give up the right to have the 
matter disposed of through arbitration. It is thus the duty of the court 
to carefully examine the facts in each case so as to determine whether 
the conduct of the party seeking the stay amounts to pursuing the suit. 
The conduct of the party seeking a stay of the proceedings ought to 
manifestly reflect willingness to participate in the proceedings and 
thus the factor of acquiescence must not be in doubt.”  
VII. 
TEST OF “STEP IN PROCEEDINGS”  
 
14. 
As discussed above, the Supreme Court of Pakistan has already 
made test regarding stepping in proceedings in “PIA case” supra 
which was further followed by Islamabad High Court in “Pakistan 
Stone” case, supra distinguished other views reiterating that 
requesting a single adjournment would tantamount to stepping in the 
proceedings by the party seeking a stay of the proceedings. Returning 
to case in hand, Section 34 of the “Act” permits an application 
seeking stay of proceedings of a suit with intent to proceed ahead 
separately for the arbitration as per the settlement of parties in their 
agreement. According to aforementioned, Section 34 of the “Act”, 
where any party to an arbitration agreement commences any legal 
proceedings against any other party to the agreement in respect of any 
matter agreed to be referred for arbitration, the party sued against, 
may at any time make an application before the Court dealing with 
such suit for staying down proceedings thereof, but such move may be 
geared only before filing a written statement or taking any other steps 
in the proceedings. The narration of Section 34 ibid makes intent of 
legislature quite clear that purpose thereof is to drive parties to 
approach the medium of arbitration first prior to setting in litigation 
through any other suit, as per their own agreement. The course and 
mode of arbitration is globally recognized for the purpose of fair and 
efficient settlement of dispute arising in domestic and international 
commercial relations. The Courts are always required to support the 

F.A.O.No.88 of 2023 
 
       11 
arbitration proceedings and process to meet with object of the “Act” 
destined at for cost free, efficacious, effective and amicable resolution 
of disputes amongst parties. Intervention or interference in such 
process or proceedings have never been discouraged by the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in a number of judgments.  
15. 
Like the case in hand, the limits of the Courts, while dealing 
with litigation involving the arbitration agreements, amongst parties, 
has been discussed in detail by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
“KARACHI DOCK LABOUR BOARD versus Messrs QUALITY 
BUILDERS LTD.” (PLD 2016 Supreme Court 121) holding that  
“It may also be stated that there are three 
modes and approaches to arbitration: (i) 
without the intervention of the court; (ii) with 
the intervention of the court (see Section 20 of 
the Act); and (iii) again with the intervention 
of the court but where a suit/ lis is pending 
between the parties and they agree for the 
resolution of their disputes through the 
mechanism of arbitration, keeping the suit 
pending and that the fate thereof (suit) be 
decided on the basis of the decision rendered 
by the arbitrator”.  
 
16. 
In another judgment in case titled “NATIONAL HIGHWAY 
AUTHORITY through Chairman, Islamabad versus Messrs SAMBU 
CONSTRUCTION CO. LTD. ISLAMABAD and others” (2023 
SCMR 1103), Hon’ble Mr. Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah of 
Supreme Court of Pakistan discussed the scope of arbitration and 
permissible interference of Courts whilst observing that frivolous 
litigation clogs the pipelines of justice causing delay in deciding 
genuine claims which vexatious and frivolous petitions add to the 
pendency of cases over-burdening the Court dockets and slowing 
down the engine of justice and further held that “An over-intrusive 
approach by courts in examination of the arbitral Awards must be 
avoided……The jurisdiction of the Court under the Act is 
supervisory in nature… Interference is only possible if there exists 
any breach of duty or any irregularity of action which is not 
consistent with general principles of equity and good conscience. 

F.A.O.No.88 of 2023 
 
       12 
The arbitrator alone is the judge of the quality as well as the 
quantity of the evidence. He is the final arbiter of dispute between 
the parties. He acts in a quasi-judicial manner and his decision is 
entitled to utmost respect and weight…The arbitration is a forum 
of the parties' own choice its decision should not be lightly 
interfered by the court, until a clear and definite case within the 
purview of the section 30 of the Act is made out…The arbitration 
falls within the domain of alternate dispute resolution ("ADR") and 
the parties having once recoursed to out of court dispute 
resolution, they must abide by the decision of the Arbitrators 
rather than challenging the same in the court of law, as it defeats 
the purpose of ADR”. 
17. 
Recently, again dealing with subject of interreference on part 
of Courts in dispute pertaining to the arbitration agreements 
between parties, Hon’ble Syed Mansoor Ali Shah J. of Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in case titled “TAISEI CORPORATION and 
another versus A.M. CONSTRUCTION COMPANY (PVT.) LTD. and 
another” (2024 SCMR 640) has held that “Arbitration thus 
embodies the principles of autonomy and voluntariness, respecting 
the parties' freedom to design a process that best suits their needs. 
It reflects a philosophical shift towards self-governance in dispute 
resolution, allowing parties to choose their arbitrators and the 
applicable law, thereby creating a more tailored and potentially 
equitable outcome. The role of courts in the context of arbitration 
has 
therefore 
evolved 
with 
a 
trend 
towards 
minimal 
interference…More significant is the minimal interference in 
international commercial arbitration that stands as a cornerstone 
in the resolution of cross-border commercial disputes, offering a 
preferred alternative to litigation in national courts for businesses 
worldwide. One of the foundational aspects of international 
commercial 
arbitration 
is 
its 
emphasis 
on 
neutrality, 
expeditiousness, efficiency and the ability to provide solutions 
tailored to the needs of international business transactions. 
International commercial arbitration plays a crucial role in 

F.A.O.No.88 of 2023 
 
       13 
resolving disputes arising from cross-border trade and commerce, 
expeditiously and efficiently. The global view on international 
commercial arbitration is therefore overwhelmingly positive, with 
businesses and legal professionals alike recognizing its benefits 
over traditional litigation”.  
18. 
It is settled principle that where the Supreme Court 
deliberately and with the intention of settling the law, pronounces 
upon a question of law, such pronouncement is the law declared by 
the Supreme Court within the meaning of Article 189 of the 
Constitution and is binding on all Courts in Pakistan. Narration of 
Section 34 of the “Act” and esteemed guidelines laid by the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in the “PIA case” make abundantly clear that the 
test for stepping in proceedings for the purpose of said provision of 
law are:  
i. 
whether the party sought an adjournment for filing the 
written statement;  
ii. 
whether the moved application, the contents whereof as 
well as all the surrounding circumstances that led the party 
to make the application, display an unequivocal intention to 
proceed with the suit, and to give up the right to' have the 
matter disposed of by arbitration.  
iii. 
An application of such nature, therefore, should prima facie 
be construed as a step in the proceedings within the 
meaning of section 34.  
 
19. 
In this particular case, no written application finds moved on 
behalf of the Appellant in proceedings of relevant suit seeking 
adjournment for filing written statement construing the conduct of the 
Appellant, in order to be termed as 'a step in the proceedings', was 
such as would manifestly had displayed an unequivocal intention to 
proceed with the suit and giving up the right to have the matter 
disposed of by arbitration. Likewise, record does not reflect at all any 
statement on behalf of the Appellant or his counsel with above 
mentioned disclosure and intent signed by them. The learned trial 

F.A.O.No.88 of 2023

Court went on to grant adjournments for the purpose of submission of 
written statement in quite casual and routine manner without taking 
into consideration the law in field related with the matter in dispute 
as well as time to time laid interpretations and guidelines of the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in said regard. At the cost of repetition, it 
is high time to encourage parties to return to the medium of 
arbitration for the resolution of their disputes, instead to frustrate the 
law in field, protecting intent of parties for resolution, through 
arbitration of their disputes as per their already settled agreements. 
The Courts in said regard are always desired to refrain from 
interference eventuating in unwanted delay in resolution of disputes 
of parties. In the matter in hand, there existed duly executed 
agreement between the parties including an arbitration Clause 9 as 
that in the event of any dispute arising among the parties the matter 
shall be referred to any arbitrator appointed with the mutual consent 
of all the partners and his decision shall be binding on all of them. 
Not only the parties, but the Court was also required by law to 
honour and to first return to actuate the object of said clause prior to 
proceeding ahead with the civil suit in question, which learned trial 
Court has remained fail to comply with. The judgment relied upon by 
learned trial Court in impugned order did not confirm to the facts of 
the issue in hand and the guidelines pronounced by the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan were not visited rather altogether ignored.  
VIII. OPINION OF COURT 
20. 
Any written application apart, the pertaining situation shows 
that in presence of the learned Presiding Officer concerned only one 
adjournment was granted on 06 07 2023 for purpose of filing of 
written statement/written reply purportedly mere on basis of oral 
request, that too, placed by representative/associate of learned 
counsel for the Appellant. In addition thereto, preceding two orders 
depicting 
mechanical 
adjournments 
for 
filing 
written 
statement/written reply on behalf of the Appellant were in absence of 
the learned Presiding Officer concerned. Importantly, no written 
statement was filed on behalf of the Appellant till arrival of his 

F.A.O.No.88 of 2023 
 
       15 
application under Section 34 of the Act. Significant to mention here 
that none of the proceedings of the main suit or the hard agitated 
requests made for adjournments for filing of written statement 
indicate conduct or intent of the Appellant that he had abdicated his 
claim to have the dispute decided under the arbitration clause and 
to have thereby forfeited his right to claim stay of the proceedings 
in the Court. Nothing is available over surface of record to 
construe that Conduct of the defendant, in order to be termed as 'a 
step in the proceedings', was such as would manifestly had displayed 
an unequivocal intention to proceed with the suit and giving up the 
right to have the matter disposed of by arbitration. The learned Trial 
Court has passed impugned order in utter disregard of parameters 
and criteria for test laid down by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
“PIA case” mentioned supra, later followed by the Islamabad High 
Court in “Pakistan Stone” case, mentioned supra for ascertainment 
and determination of act of Appellant in order to be termed as 'a 
step in the proceedings'. 
IX. 
CONCLUSION 
21. 
In view of above, this Appeal is allowed, the impugned order 
dated 22.07.2023, passed by the Civil Judge 1st Class, Rawalpindi, is 
hereby set aside. Consequently, the Application under Section 34 of 
the “Act” shall be deemed to be pending. The learned trial Court, 
after affording an opportunity of hearing to the Parties, shall decide 
the said Application in accordance with the principles and law 
discussed above.
