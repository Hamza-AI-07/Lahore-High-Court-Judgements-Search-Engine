MIRZA VIQAS RAUF, J. This petition under Article 199 of 
the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
(hereinafter referred to as “Constitution”) stems from the judgment 
dated 16th February, 2023 handed down by the learned Additional 
District Judge, Hassan Abdal (Attock), whereby he proceeded to 
dismiss the application of the petitioners moved under Section 12(2) 
of the Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908) (hereinafter referred to as 
“C.P.C.”). 
2. 
Factual backdrop of this petition is that respondent No.1 
(hereinafter referred to as “respondent”) instituted a suit for recovery 
of dower, maintenance and dowry articles against respondents No.2 
& 3. Suit was ultimately partly decreed by way of judgment dated 4th 
February, 2020 whereunder “respondent” was held entitled to 
recover a house as part of dower alongwith other reliefs claimed. 

Writ Petition No.1234 of 2023 
-2- 
 
Being aggrieved respondents No.2 & 3 preferred an appeal before 
the learned Additional District Judge, Hassan Abdal (Attock) but it 
was partly allowed vide judgment and decree dated 18th December, 
2020 maintaining the decree qua house as part of dower. After 
passing of decree in her favour, “respondent” filed an execution 
petition wherein as per claim of the petitioners, property owned by 
them was made subject to satisfaction of decree, which prompted 
them to move an application under Section 12(2) of the “C.P.C.” 
before the learned Additional District Judge, Hassan Abdal (Attock). 
The application was, however, dismissed through impugned 
judgment. 
3. 
On presentation of this petition a query was put to learned 
counsel for the petitioners on 7th April, 2023 with regard to 
competency of this constitutional petition, who in return sought time 
for the purpose of assistance. On the next date i.e. 14th April, 2023 in 
the light of contentions of learned counsel for the petitioners, this 
petition was admitted for regular hearing with the observation that 
question of maintainability shall be decided at final stage. 
4. 
Record reveals that despite service, respondents No.2 & 3 did 
not appear and as such they were proceeded against ex-parte vide 
order dated 10th September, 2024. 
5. 
Agha Muhammad Ali Khan, Advocate representing the 
petitioners submitted that Family Court is defined in Sections 2(b) 
read with Section 3 of the Family Courts Act, 1964. He added that 
learned Additional District Judge since acted in the capacity of 
appellate court so cannot be termed as Family Court and as such writ 
petition is maintainable. Learned counsel contended that petitioners 
as well as “respondent” are daughters-in-law of respondent No.3, 
who at the time of their marriages given the property and house 
subject matter of suit as dower to them but on filing of suit by 
“respondent”, this material fact was not brought on record 
fraudulently, which resulted into passing of impugned judgment and 
decree. It is further contended by learned counsel that on attaining 
knowledge, the petitioners moved an application under Section 12(2) 
of the “C.P.C.” which has been dismissed in a summary manner, 

Writ Petition No.1234 of 2023 
-3- 
 
while holding that such an application is not maintainable in view of 
Section 17 of the Family Courts Act, 1964. It is emphatically argued 
that application of the petitioners was also dismissed being bereft of 
any merits. Learned counsel submitted that impugned judgment is 
tainted with illegalities and not tenable. In support of his contentions, 
learned counsel placed reliance on MUHAMMAD ARSHAD ANJUM 
versus Mst. KHURSHID BEGUM and others (2021 SCMR 1145) and 
MUHAMMAD AKRAM MALIK versus Dr. GHULAM RABBANI and others 
(PLD 2006 Supreme Court 773). 
6. 
Conversely, learned counsel for “respondent” though seriously 
resisted this petition but did not question its maintainability. Learned 
counsel submitted that application under Section 12(2) of the 
“C.P.C.” was rightly turned down by learned Additional District 
Judge. He added that provisions of the “C.P.C.” are stricto sensu not 
applicable before the Family Court. Learned counsel contended with 
vehemence that impugned judgment is unexceptionable and calls for 
no interference.  
7. 
Heard. Record perused. 
8. 
Suit was instituted by “respondent” while invoking the 
provisions of the Family Courts Act, 1964 (hereinafter referred to as 
“Act, 1964”). As per preamble of the “Act, 1964”, it was enacted to 
make provision for the establishment of Family Courts for the 
expeditious settlement and disposal of disputes relating to marriage 
and family affairs and for matters connected therewith. Section 2 
deals with the definitions clause and it defined “Family Court” as 
under :- 
“(b) “Family Court” means a Court constitute under this Act” 
Section 3 of the “Act, 1964” mandates the Government of Punjab to 
establish Family Courts, which reads as under :- 
“S. 3. Establishment of Family Courts.– (1) Government shall 
establish one or more Family Courts in each District or at such 
other place or places as it may deem necessary and appoint a 
Judge for each of such Court: 
      Provided that at least one Family Court in each District, 
shall be presided over by a woman Judge to be appointed 
within a period of six months or within such period as 

Writ Petition No.1234 of 2023 
-4- 
 
the Federal Government may, on the request of Provincial 
Government, extend; 
      (2)  A woman Judge may be appointed for more than one 
District and in such cases the woman Judge may sit for the 
disposal of cases at such place or places in either District, as the 
Provincial Government may specify. 
      (3)  Government shall, in consultation with the High Court, 
appoint as many woman Judges as may be necessary for the 
purposes of sub-section 1.” 
9. 
It would not be out of context to mention here that a Family 
Court is a Civil Court in every aspect despite the exclusion of the 
provisions of the “C.P.C.” with exception to Sections 10 & 11 and 
the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 by virtue of Section 17 of the 
“Act, 1964”. Though in terms of Rule 3 of the Family Courts Rules, 
1965, the courts of the District Judge, the Additional District Judge 
are also designated as Family Courts alongwith the Civil Judge but 
ordinarily functions of Family Courts are assigned to the Civil Judge 
and the District Judge and the Additional District Judge acts as 
appellate court as is evident from the bare reading of Section 14 of 
the “Act, 1964”. For ready reference and convenience Section 14 is 
reproduced below :- 
“S. 14.    Appeals.– (1) Notwithstanding anything provided in 
any other law for the time being in force, a decision given or a 
decree passed by a Family Court shall be appealable– 
         (a)  to the High Court, where the Family Court is presided 
over by a District Judge, an Additional District Judge or a 
person notified by Government to be of the rank and status of 
a District Judge or an Additional District Judge; and 
         (b)  to the District Court, in any other case. 
      (2)  No appeal shall lie from a decree passed by Family Court– 
            (a)  for dissolution of marriage, except in the case of 
dissolution for reasons specified in clause (d) of item (viii) of 
section 2 of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939; 
            (b)  for dower or dowry not exceeding rupees thirty thousand; 
            (c)  for maintenance of rupees one thousand or less per 
month. 
 (3) No appeal or revision shall lie against an interim order 
passed by a Family Court. 
 (4) The appellate Court referred to in sub-section (1) shall 
dispose of the appeal within a period of four months.” 
It is thus evident that learned Additional District Judge, Hassan 
Abdal (Attock) who decided the application of petitioners under 
Section 12(2) of the “C.P.C.” was officiating as appellate court, thus 
this writ petition is maintainable and the query is answered 
accordingly. 

Writ Petition No.1234 of 2023 
-5- 
 
10. 
Now adverting to the moot point as to whether an application 
under Section 12(2) of the “C.P.C.” is maintainable before a Family 
Court established under the “Act, 1964” in view of exclusion of 
provisions of the Code ibid in the light of Section 17 of the “Act, 
1964”; suffice to observe that provisions of the “C.P.C.” are 
generally ousted to the Family Courts to frustrate the technicalities to 
hamper the proceedings before the Family Courts, as the “Act, 1964” 
stresses upon speedy settlement of family disputes. The exclusion of 
provisions of the “C.P.C.”, however, does not mean that it cannot be 
pressed into service at all by the Family Courts. Where there is no 
provision in the “Act, 1964” to deal with a subject, provisions of 
“C.P.C.” can be invoked for the advancement of ends of justice. 
Needless to reiterate that the provisions of the “C.P.C.” are though 
stricto sensu not applicable in family matters but the Family Court is 
always competent to mold the relief keeping in view the 
circumstances of each case to foster justice. 
11. 
Needless to mention that subsection (2) of Section 12 of the 
“C.P.C.” was initially not the part of Code even. It was added 
through Ordinance 10 of 1980. Prior to insertion of subsection (2) in 
section 12 of the “C.P.C.” one has to institute a suit for setting aside 
of a judgment, decree or order obtained by practicing fraud upon the 
court but with the introduction of subsection (2), fresh suit was 
barred. 
12. 
By virtue of subsection (2) of Section 12 of the “C.P.C.” any 
person can challenge the validity of judgment, decree or order on the 
plea of fraud, misrepresentation or want of jurisdiction by filing an 
application to the court which passed the final judgment, decree or 
order. The term “person” used in subsection (2) has wider import and 
cannot be narrowly interpreted, so as to restrict it to refer to only a 
judgment debtor or his successors but it should be read to include 
any person adversely effected even though not a party to the 
proceedings wherein such decree, judgment or order is passed. The 
scope of Section 12(2) of “C.P.C.” is not narrow but wider enough. 
It is not restricted to the judgment, decree or order obtained while 
playing fraud with the court but it also extends to the cases where a 

Writ Petition No.1234 of 2023 
-6- 
 
judgment, decree or order has been obtained by the parties through 
fraud interse by concealment of true facts. 
13. 
In the case of MUHAMMAD ARSHAD ANJUM versus Mst. 
KHURSHID BEGUM and others (2021 SCMR 1145) while dealing with a 
similar proposition, Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled as under :- 
“4. 
Petitioner's recourse to defend his title in the disputed 
land, decreed in respondent's favour as her dower, before the 
Family Court and latter before the Additional District Judge, 
though somewhat haphazard, nonetheless, was the only 
option available to him. The Family Court decreed the suit, 
without a full dress trial merely upon failure of respondent's 
husband to take special oath, a circumstance that too 
prevailed with the learned Appellate Court. Ostensible 
contest remained restricted between the spouses without 
slightest breach in the nuptial bond, to the exclusion of rest 
of the world. Failure of petitioner's Constitution petition in 
the High Court also turned out a far cry. Throughout the 
contest, respondent relied upon technical barricades, thus, 
the questions that call for our consideration are whether 
exclusion of the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 
1908 barring sections 10 and 11 thereof, stood in 
impediment to petitioner's approach to the Family Court for 
re-examination of the judgment within the contemplation of 
section 12(2) of the Code or that he should have asserted his 
claim of being a bona fide purchaser with consideration 
through an intervener in civil plenary jurisdiction? 
The Family Court Act 1964 (W.P. Act XXXV of 1964) (the 
Act) was enacted for "…… expeditious settlement and 
disposal of disputes relating to marriage and family affairs 
and for matters connected therewith"; provisions of the 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (P.O. No.10 of 1984) and 
those of the Code except sections 10 and 11 have been 
excluded to achieve the legislative intent. The exclusion of 
normal rules of procedure and proof, applicable in civil 
plenary jurisdiction for adjudication of disputes in 
proceedings before a Family Court, is essentially designed to 
circumvent delays in disposal of sustenance claims by the 
vulnerable; this does not derogate its status as a Court nor 
takes away its inherent jurisdiction to protect its orders and 
decrees from the taints of fraud and misrepresentation as 
such powers must vest in every tribunal to ensure that stream 
of justice runs pure and clean; such intendment is important 
yet for another reason, as at times, adjudications by a Family 
Court 
may 
involve 
decisions 
with 
far 
reaching 
implications/consequences for a spouse or a sibling and, 
thus, there must exist a mechanism to recall or rectify 
outcome of any sinister or oblique manipulation, therefore, 
we find no clog on the authority of a Family Court to re-
examine its earlier decision with a view to secure the ends of 
justice and prevent abuse of its jurisdiction and for the said 
purpose, in the absence of any express prohibition in the 
Act, it can borrow the procedure from available avenues, 
chartered by law. 
Question of non-applicability of the Code barring sections 
10 and 11 thereof came up before the Court in the case of 
Muhammad Tabish Naeem Khan v. Additional District Judge 

Writ Petition No.1234 of 2023 
-7- 
 
Lahore and others (2014 SCMR 1365), in the said case, plea 
of ouster of procedure was repelled as under: 
"We are not persuaded to hold, that the ex parte decree 
dated 4.7.2008 was void, for the reason that there is no 
provision in the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 
to strike off the defence of the petitioner, when he failed 
to file the written statement, thus, it (decree) should be 
ignored; suffice it to say that the Family Court is the 
quasi judicial forum, which can draw and follow its own 
procedure provided such procedure should not be 
against the principles of fair hearing and trial,…….". 
In the case of Haji Muhammad Nawaz v. Samina Kanwal 
and others (2017 SCMR 321) it was reiterated that: 
"Family Court, whether as a trial court or an executing 
court, are governed by the general principles of equity, 
justice and fair play". 
Impact of fraud practiced upon tribunals exercising plenary 
or limited jurisdictions, respectively, cannot be procedurally 
classified as in all jurisdictions it unredeemedly vitiates the 
very solemnity of adjudication, a wrong that cannot be 
countenanced and must be remedied through dynamic 
application of equitable principles of law and such approach 
has been approved by this Court in a good number of cases 
arising out of erstwhile rent laws that too excluded 
wholesale application of the Code. See PLD 1975 SC 331 
The Chief Settlement Commissioner, Lahore v. Raja 
Mohammad Fazil Khan and others, 1992 SCMR 917 
Tanveer Jamshed and another v. Raja Ghulam Haider, 1992 
SCMR 1908 Mst. Fehmida Begum v. Muhammad Khalid and 
another, 1993 SCMR 226 Fazal Elahi Malis through legal 
heirs v. Miss Abida Reasat Rizvi, 1997 SCMR 1986 Haji 
Khudai Nazar and another v. Haji Abdul Bari, 2000 SCMR 
540 Masjid Intizamia Committee and others v. Anjuman-e-
Falah-o-Bahbood and others, 2001 SCMR 577 Hanif and 
others v. Malik Armed Shah and another, 2005 SCMR 882 
Suhail Printing Press v. Syed Aley Eba Zaidi, 2007 SCMR 
818 Muhammad Tariq Khan v. Khawaja Muhammad Jawad 
Asami and others, 2007 SCMR 1434 Ammanullah Khan

Saleem v. Mrs. Shamim Attaullah Khan and others and 1984 
CLC 2855 Abdul Salam v. Mrs. Tahira Zaidi. 
5. 
Recourse to plenary jurisdiction as suggested by the 
learned counsel for the respondent would be a journey into a 
blind alley as in the face of a final decree by the Family 
Court, holding the field, the proposed course would 
inevitably lead to a chaotic collusion, if at all the petitioner 
ever 
succeed. 
Therefore, 
in 
the 
circumstances, 
reconsideration/re-examination of the impugned judgment 
and decree by the learned Family Court is the only expedient 
option, conducive to the interest of the contestants. The 
petition is converted into appeal and allowed with no order 
as to costs. Impugned judgment dated 04.03.2019 is set 
aside, as a consequence thereof, appellant's claim in the 
property as mentioned in his application be attended by the 
learned Additional District Judge Multan before whom his 
application under section 12(2) of the Code shall be deemed 
as pending. Since this matter is pending for considerable 
time, the learned Court seized of the matter, in the fullness 
of time, shall decide it with all convenient dispatch sooner 
rather than later.”

14. 
In a recent judgment in the case of FOZIA MAZHAR versus 
ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE, JHANG and others (PLD 2024 Supreme 
Court 771) Supreme Court of Pakistan reiterated the same principles. 
The relevant extract from the same is reproduced below :- 
“Issue No. I  
Application of Section 12(2) of C.P.C. in proceedings 
before Family Courts  
8. 
Section 17 of the Act clearly provides that: 
"17.(1)  
Save as otherwise expressly provided by or 
under this Act, the provisions of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat, 1984 (P.O. No. 10 of 1984), and the 
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, except sections 10 
and 11 shall not apply to proceeding before any 
Family Court in respect of Part I of Schedule. 
 
(2) Sections 8 to 11 of the Oaths Act, 1872, shall apply 
to all proceedings before the Family Courts." 
The letter of the above stated law is but clear, vesting the 
Family Court not to be shackled by rigors of intricate 
procedural rules provided under C.P.C., and granting the 
Family Court, the authority to proceed swiftly to resolve the 
dispute between the estranged spouses. A glance through the 
jurisprudence regarding the applicability of the provisions or 
for that matter, the general principles enunciated in C.P.C. 
that have developed over time by this Court would be 
beneficial for addressing the present issue before us. Some 
of the pertinent discourse on the subject rendered by this 
Court is contained in the following decisions: 
 
Sayed Abbas Taqi Mehdi v. Mst. Sayeda Sabahat 
Batool (2010 SCMR 1840)  
 
The issue in this case involved a challenge made to 
an ex-parte order passed by the Family Court in suits 
for possession of dowry articles and maintenance. 
The Court held that the Family Court had correctly 
dismissed the application for setting aside ex-parte 
decree on merits as well as being time barred, and 
observed that though the provisions of C.P.C. and 
law of evidence are not applicable qua the 
proceedings before the Family Court in terms of 
Section 17 of the Act yet the Family Court has to 
regulate its own proceedings in accordance with the 
provisions of the Act, and thus, the Family Court is 
not barred to follow the principles of C.P.C. 
 
Muhammad Tabish Naeem Khan v. Additional 
District Judge, Lahore (2014 SCMR 1365)  
 
The challenge made to an ex-parte order maintaining 
the decisions of the Family Court, District Court, and 
the High Court allowing the maintenance allowance 
to a spouse and granting her the dowry decree was 
repelled by this Court, since the challenging 
petitioner neither filed for seeking the setting aside of 
the ex-parte decree passed against him nor did he file 
any appeal against the same. This Court further 
opined that, if a defendant of a family matter, who is 
duly served; and especially the one who appears and 
disappears and also does not file his written statement 
within the time allowed to him by the Court, the 
Court shall have the inherent power to proceed to 

Writ Petition No.1234 of 2023 
-9- 
 
strike-off his defence, and to pass an ex -parte decree 
in line with the principles, as are enunciated by 
C.P.C. In any case, it was held that striking-off 
defence of a party by the Family Court cannot be 
considered to be void. 
 
Muhammad Arshad Anjum v. Mst. Khurshid Begum 
(2021 SCMR 1145)  
 
In this case, the petitioner purchased land unaware 
that it was under attachment due to a decree of the 
Family Court in favor of the respondent. The 
question before the Court was in essence, whether the 
exclusion of certain provisions of C.P.C. provided 
under Section 17 of the Act barred the petitioner from 
approaching the Family Court for a re-examination of 
the judgment within the contemplation of Section 
12(2) of C.P.C. or that he should have asserted his 
claim of being a bona fide purchaser with 
consideration as an intervener in civil plenary 
jurisdiction. The Court ruled that the Family Court 
had the authority to re-examine its earlier decision to 
ensure justice and prevent abuse of its jurisdiction 
and for the said purpose, in the absence of any 
express prohibition in the Act, it could borrow the 
procedure from other legal avenues. The petition for 
leave to appeal was allowed, overturning the 
impugned judgment, and allowing the application of 
the petitioner under Section 12(2) of C.P.C. to 
proceed. 
9. 
Given the above clear view of this Court on the issue, 
we have no manner of doubt that the Family Court may 
apply the general principles enshrined in C.P.C. in 
proceeding with not only the trial but also exercise 
jurisdiction in entertaining an application of an aggrieved 
party, challenging the validity of a judgment, decree or order 
on the plea of fraud or misrepresentation, as was done by the 
respondent in the present case, and rightly maintained so by 
the three Courts below.” 
15. 
In the case of FOZIA MAZHAR versus ADDITIONAL DISTRICT 
JUDGE and 2 others (2021 CLC 270) in somewhat similar facts and 
circumstances this Court held as under :- 
“6. 
In view of the above, If for the sake of arguments this 
Court considers that application section 12(2) of the Code of 
Civil Procedure, 1908 was not maintainable due to non-
applicability of C.P.C., even then the learned Judge Family 
Court in a case where as decree or order has been obtained 
through fraud, deceits, misrepresentation or on any of such 
grounds, the learned Judge Family Court can competently 
entertain such an application under the inherent jurisdiction, 
which is presumed and considered to be vesting in all 
Courts, Tribunals or authority of even limited jurisdiction, 
because it is a settled principle of law that fraud vitiates the 
most solemn proceedings even and the decrees, orders or the 
judgments obtained in pursuit of these intentions or actions 
are to be reviewed, reversed, recalled or upset. This rule is 
based on the principle that an authority if can do act or pass 
an order, judgment or decree, it can undo it also but with 
some exceptions also, if the authority has been defrauded in 

Writ Petition No.1234 of 2023 
-10- 
 
the passing of that act, order or judgment. 
 
In addition to the above, the general rule that power 
of review does not exist unless it is expressly conferred by 
law, has got two well-established exceptions i.e. (i) a court 
has inherent jurisdiction to set aside judgment or order 
which it had delivered without jurisdiction; (ii) a court or 
authority has the power to review an order or judgment 
obtained by fraud. Reliance is placed on The Chief Settlment 
Commissioner, Lahore v. Raja Muhammad Fazil Khan and 
others (PLD 1975 SC 331). In this view of the matter, when 
facts of this case are considered and read, it appears that the 
order dated 27.04.2015 has been obtained by the petitioner 
through misrepresentation, because in the entire file of the 
suit proceedings, Wakalatnama of Mr. Muhammad Asif 
Mughal Advocate, allegedly representing the respondent 
No.3 through his special attorney, is not available, which 
shows that he neither represented the respondent during the 
proceedings of suit nor he appeared as counsel till the 
decision of the suit on 04.04.2015; thus, there is nothing on 
record to suggest that the respondent No.3 was duly 
represented and even the first order which is in the 
handwriting of the learned Judge Family Court shows the 
presence of only Fozia Mazhar, the petitioner and margin of 
order sheet bears her signatures and thumb impression and 
only her statement is available on file and no statement of 
special power of attorney of the respondent No.3. When the 
position remained as such, the learned trial Court was vested 
with jurisdiction to undo the order dated 27.04.2015 
obtained by the petitioner through misrepresentation. 
7. 
Pursuant to the above discussion, it can safely be held 
that there appears no jurisdictional error, legal infirmity and 
illegality in the impugned order and judgment passed by the 
learned Courts below, rather vested jurisdiction has 
judiciously and aptly been exercised. The impugned order 
and judgment are upto the dexterity and do not call for any 
interference by this Court in exercise of extraordinary 
constitutional 
jurisdiction. 
Resultantly, 
while 
placing 
reliance on the judgments supra, the constitutional petition 
in hand being without any force and substance stands 
dismissed. No order as to the costs.” 
After having an overview of the principles laid down in the above 
cited judgments no cavil left to hold that despite an embargo in terms 
of Section 17 of the “Act, 1964” there is no legal impediment in the 
way of an aggrieved person moving an application under Section 
12(2) of the “C.P.C.” before the Family Court. 
16. 
Next comes the propriety of impugned judgment to the extent 
of deciding the application of the petitioners in a summary manner; 
suffice to observe that though it is not a principle of universal 
application that in each and every case, the court is bound to frame 
the issues before deciding the fate of an application under Section 
12(2) of the “C.P.C.” but where misrepresentation and fraud have 

Writ Petition No.1234 of 2023 
-11- 
 
been alleged and prima facie a case is made out, in such an 
eventuality said application should have not been dismissed 
summarily. In somewhat similar circumstances Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the case reported as MUHAMMAD AKRAM MALIK versus Dr. 
GHULAM RABBANI and others (PLD 2006 Supreme Court 773) held as 
under :- 
“4. We have examined the above-mentioned contentions in the 
light of relevant provisions of law and record of the case. We 
have minutely perused the judgment impugned whereby the 
revision petition preferred on behalf of respondent has been 
accepted. There is no cavil with the proposition that an 
application preferred under section 12(2), C.P.C. could have 
been summarily dismissed if it is without any substance but 
generally where misrepresentation and fraud have been alleged 
and prima facie a case is made out, in such an eventuality such 
application should have not been dismissed summarily and 
without recording the evidence. It is worth mentioning that 
primarily it is the satisfaction of the Court concerned either to 
frame issues, record evidence or decide such application as 
may be deemed fit and proper after considering the merits of 
each case. No yardstick can be fixed for rejection of such 
applications. A similar proposition was discussed in case 
Ghulam Muhammad v. Ahmed Khan 1993 SCMR 662 wherein 
it was observed as follows:-- 
"It is correct that the determination of allegations of fraud 
and misrepresentation, usually involved investigation into 
the questions of fact but it is not in every case that the 
Court would be under obligations to frame issues, record 
evidence of the parties and follow the procedure prescribed 
for decision of the suit. If it were so, the purpose of 
providing the new remedy would be defeated. In our view, 
the matter is left, to the satisfaction of the Court which has 
to regulate its proceeding and keeping in view the nature of 
the allegations in the application, may adopt such mode for 
its 
disposal, 
as 
in 
consonance 
with 
justice, 
the 
circumstances of the case may require. It is within the 
competence of the Court to frame formal issues and record 
evidence if the facts of a particular so demand. 
5. It is well-entrenched legal proposition that the framing of 
issues depends on the circumstances of each case, nature of 
alleged fraud and the decree so obtained. Framing of issues 
in every case to examine the merits of the application 
would certainly frustrate object of section 12(2), C.P.C. 
which is to avoid, protracted and the time consuming 
litigation and to save the genuine decree-holder from grave 
hardships, ordeal of further litigation, extra burden on their 
exchequer and simultaneously to reduce unnecessary 
burden on the Courts below which are already 
overburdened." 
5. The petition in question has also been adjudged on the 
touchstone of the criterion as mentioned herein above. We are 
of the considered view that misrepresentation and fraud have 
been alleged in the application preferred under section 12(2), 
C.P.C. as is indicative from para. 6 of the application which 
has been reproduced in the order impugned. In fact the learned 

Writ Petition No.1234 of 2023 
-12- 
 
trial Court has not appreciated the contents of application in the 
light of provisions as contained in section 12(2), C.P.C. and 
dismissed the same in a casual and cursory manner. In view of 
the circumstances of the case and allegations levelled in the 
application under section 12(2), C.P.C. it should have not been 
dismissed summarily. The learned High Court has exercised its 
discretion judiciously and the order impugned being well based 
does not warrant interference as no prejudice whatsoever has 
been caused to the petitioner who would have ample 
opportunities to canvass his point of view and substantiate his 
claim and rebut the allegation of misrepresentation and fraud 
before the Courts concerned.” 
Keeping in mind the facts and circumstances of the case in the light 
of above noted principles an inference can easily be derived that the 
allegations levelled by the petitioners in their application are having 
due force to compel the court to frame issues instead of dismissing 
the application in a cursory and slipshod manner. Even otherwise it 
seems quite strange that on the one hand, the learned Additional 
District Judge held the application under Section 12(2) of “C.P.C.” 
not maintainable and on the other dilated upon its merits. Needless to 
reiterate that after forming negative opinion about the maintainability 
of application the learned Additional District Judge should have 
simply dismissed the same on said score instead of delving into its 
other merits. 
17. 
The nutshell of above noted threadbare discussion is that the 
learned Additional District Judge while dismissing the application 
under Section 12(2) of “C.P.C.” filed by the petitioners has erred in 
law. This petition is thus allowed, impugned judgment dated 16th 
February, 2023 is set aside being illegal and unlawful. As a 
consequence, application moved by the petitioners under Section 
12(2) of “C.P.C.” shall be deemed to be pending before the learned 
Additional District Judge, Hassan Abdal (Attock), who shall decide 
the same afresh after framing of necessary issues arising therefrom 
with all swiftness. No order as to costs.
