------------------------ 
 
 
AALIA NEELUM, J:- The appellant-Manzoor Ahmad, son 
of Chanan Khan, caste Korra, resident of Village Korra, Tehsil & District 
Khushab, was involved in case F.I.R. No.396 of 2017, dated 19.11.2017, 
registered under Sections 302, 34 P.P.C., at P.S. Khushab, District Khushab 
and was tried by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, District Khushab. 
The trial court seized with the matter in terms of the judgment dated 
02.05.2019, convicted Manzoor Ahmad (the appellant) under Section 
302(b) PPC as Tazir and sentenced to Death for committing Qatl-e-Amd of 
Muhammad Jabbar (the deceased), with the direction to pay compensation of 
Rs.15,00,000/- to the legal heirs of the deceased as envisaged under section 
544-A of Cr.P.C and in case of default thereof, to undergo 06-months S.I 
further. 
2. 
 
Feeling aggrieved by the judgment of the trial court, Manzoor 
Ahmad, the appellant, has assailed his conviction and sentence by filing the 

Murder Reference No.129 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.44496-J of 2019 & 
Crl. Appeal No.37914 of 2019

instant jail appeal bearing Criminal Appeal No.44496-J of 2019. The trial 
court also referred M.R. No.129 of 2019 (The State. Vs. Manzoor Ahmad) 
to confirm the death sentence awarded to the appellant-Manzoor Ahmad. 
Whereas, the complainant also filed Crl. Appeal No.37914 of 2019 against 
the acquittal of respondent No.2, namely Khan Muhammad. All the matters 
arising from the same judgment of the trial court are being disposed of 
through a single judgment. 
3. 
 
The prosecution story, as alleged in the F.I.R (Ex.PA) lodged 
on the statement (Ex.PF) of Sultan Ahmad (PW-7)-the complainant, is that 
on 18.11.2017, at about 10:40 p.m., the complainant (PW-7) along with 
Muhammad Khan (PW-8) and Muhammad Younas (given up PW) was 
present at his dera to look after his ailing buffalo, whereas his son 
Muhammad Jabbar (the deceased) was present in front of a room of cattle 
shed. Meanwhile, Manzoor Ahmad (the appellant), armed with a gun 12-
bore repeater and Khan Muhammad (co-accused since acquitted) came 
empty-handed. Khan Muhammad (co-accused since acquitted) raised lalkara 
that they had come to take revenge for their insult; after that, Manzoor 
Ahmad (the appellant) made straight fire with his gun 12-bore repeater, 
which hit Muhammad Jabbar on the right side of his chest; Manzoor Ahmad 
(the appellant) made second fire towards the complainant’s side; Manzoor 
Ahmad (the appellant) while coming forward, again made a straight fire, 
which hit on the right side of the face of Muhammad Jabbar (the deceased). 
Meanwhile, Khan Muhammad (co-accused since acquitted) kept raising 
lalkaras that if anyone came near, he would be done to death; due to fear, 
they could not interfere. After that, Manzoor Ahmad (the appellant) and 
Khan Muhammad (co-accused since acquitted) fled away towards their dera 
while making fires and raising lalkaras. The complainant (PW-7) and PWs 
attended Muhammad Jabbar, who succumbed to the injuries. The motive 
behind the occurrence was that about 1½ years before the occurrence, the 
daughter of Manzoor Ahmad (the appellant), namely Aneetan Manzoor 
eloped with one Muhammad Imran and the accused had a suspicion that the 
complainant party had facilitated and helped the elopement of said Aneetan

Crl. Appeal No.44496-J of 2019 & 
Crl. Appeal No.37914 of 2019

Manzoor with Muhammad Imran; due to that grudge, the accused had 
murdered Muhammad Jabbar (the deceased).  
4. 
 
After the incident, the complainant reported the matter to the 
police through his statement (Ex. PF), and after that, formal F.I.R (Ex. PA) 
was chalked out by Muhammad Zaman S.I (PW-1). After the registration of 
the case, the investigation of this case was entrusted to Zafar Iqbal S.I. (PW-
9) and subsequently investigation was conducted by Muhammad Fayyaz-S.I 
(PW-11), who found the accused/appellant guilty, prepared a report under 
Section 173, Cr.P.C., and sent the same to the court of competent 
jurisdiction. On 10.03.2018, the trial court formally charge-sheeted the 
appellant, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In support of its 
version, the prosecution produced as many as twelve (12) witnesses.  
5. 
 
Ocular account, in this case, has come out from the statements 
of Sultan Ahmad (PW-7)-the complainant, and Muhammad Khan (PW-8)-
the eye witness, whereas Dr. Faisal Ramzan (PW-5), who conducted the 
postmortem examination of Muhammad Jabbar (the deceased) found the 
following injuries on his person: 
INJURIES 
1) 
A lacerated penetrating wound of 5 x 4 cm, 2 
cm below right eye on right cheek. Margins of 
the wound were irregular and inverted with 
blackening present around the margins, 
underlying maxilla bone was visibly fractured 
and shattered. This was wound of entry of 
firearm.  
2) 
A lacerated penetrating wound of 1.5 x 1 cm 
on left cheek, 3 cm anterior to left pinna. On 
probing, it was proved to be exit wound of 
injury No.1. Margins were everted. 
3) 
A lacerated wound of 1 x 0.5 cm on middle 
lower chin, 4 cm below lower lip. Margins 
were inverted with collar of abrasion present. 
This wound of entry of firearm. Mandible was 
fractured.

4) 
A lacerated penetrating wound of 1 x 0.5 cm 
on inferior aspect of lower chin, 2 cm below to 
injury No.3. Margins were inverted with collar 
of abrasion present. This was found of entry of 
firearm.  
5) 
A grazed firearm injury lacerated wound of 2 
x 1 cm on right cheek, 4 cm lateral to injury 
No.1, 3 cm below right eye, underlying 
maxilla bone was exposed and broken. 
6) 
A lacerated penetrating wound of 1 cm x 0.5 
cm on upper anterior fold of right axilla, 6 cm 
below lateral end of right clavicle, 9 cm 
superolateral to right nipple. Margins of the 
wound were inverted with collar of abrasion 
present. This was wound of entry of firearm, 
corresponding hole present on clothes. 
7) 
A lacerated penetrating wound of 1 x 0.5 cm 
on anteromedial aspect of right arm, 10 cm 
above elbow joint. Margins of the wound were 
inverted with collar of abrasion. This was 
wound of entry of firearm. Corresponding hole 
was present on clothes. 
8) 
A lacerated penetrating wound of 1 x 0.5 cm 
on posterior aspect of right arm, 10 cm above 
elbow joint. Margins of the wound were 
everted. On probing, it was proved to be the 
exit wound of injury No.7. Corresponding 
hole present on clothes. 
 
After conducting the postmortem examination, the 
doctor opined that the cause of death was due to injuries 
1 and 2, which were sufficient to cause death in the 
ordinary course of nature, as they injured skull bone and 
brain, causing intracranial hemorrhage, shock, and death. 
All the injuries were ante-mortal and were caused by a 
firearm. The probable time between injuries and death 
was immediate, whereas between death and postmortem 
was about 04 to 05 hours.  
6. 
 
The learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor gave up PWs-
Abdul Ghaffar and Muhammad Younis as being unnecessary and Fayyaz 
Ullah 552/HC being dead and after tendering reports of Punjab Forensic

Science Agency (Ex. PQ, Ex. PR) and school leaving certificate of 
Muhammad Jabbar (the deceased) as Ex.PS, character certificate as Ex.PT 
and Registration certificate (Form-B) of NADRA department as Ex.PU 
closed the prosecution evidence. 
7. 
 
The appellant was also examined in terms of Section 342 
Cr.P.C., wherein he did not opt to appear as his own witness in terms of 
section 340(2) Cr.P.C.; however, produced Altaf Hussain 2729/H.C. in his 
defence as DW-1. In response to a particular question about why this case 
was against him and why the PWs deposed against him, the appellant made 
the following deposition: - 
“The PWs are members of one family. They 
deposed falsely. In fact, in the night of 
occurrence, the son of Muhammad Mukhtar 
(PW-6), namely Ghaffar, saw Muhammad 
Jabbar (deceased) in compromising position 
with her sister, Saniya Mukhtar. He murdered 
him but to save the skin of Ghaffar and for the 
sake of family honour, as well as due to local 
friction and grudge, I have been falsely involved 
in this case.”      
 
8. 
 
After evaluating the evidence available on record in light of 
arguments advanced by both sides, the trial court found the prosecution 
version proved beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt, which resulted in 
the appellant’s conviction and sentence in the above terms.  
9. 
 
We have given our anxious and most thoughtful consideration 
to both sides’ rival submissions. We have minutely gone through the 
evidence on record.  
10. 
 
The occurrence took place on 18.11.2017 at 10.40 p.m. in the 
Dera/Cattle Shed of Sultan Ahmad, Korra, District Khushab, situated within 
the jurisdiction of Police Station Khushab, District Khushab, which is at a 
distance of 10 Kilometers only from the place of occurrence. Whereas F.I.R. 
(Exh. PA) was got registered on the oral statement (Exh. PF) of Sultan 
Ahmad (PW-7)-the complainant, on 19.11.2017 at 12.50 a.m. It is clear from 
the Fard Bayan (Exh. PF) that the statement of Sultan Ahmad (PW-7)-the 

Murder Reference No.129 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.44496-J of 2019 & 
Crl. Appeal No.37914 of 2019

complainant, was recorded by Zafar Iqbal, S.I. (PW-9) at Sandal Adda at 
12:30 a.m. Sultan Ahmad (PW-7)-the complainant took one hour and fifty 
minutes to report the incident to the police, for which no plausible 
explanation was rendered. However, the inquest report (Exh.PE) reveals that 
the time of receiving information regarding the death was 10:40 p.m. on 
18.11.2017 by Zafar Iqbal, S.I. (PW-9). Whereas Zafar Iqbal, S.I. (PW-9) 
deposed during his examination-in-chief that upon receiving information of 
the occurrence, he (PW-9), along with Jaleel-ur-Rehman 238-C (PW-10), 
Saif Ullah 125/C, and Mukhtar Hussain 62/C were going towards the place 
of occurrence, when he met with Sultan Ahmad (PW-7)-the complainant at 
Sandal Adda at 12:30 a.m. After that, he (PW-9) proceeded to the place of 
occurrence along with the complainant (PW-7) and prepared a rough site 
plan of the place of occurrence, application for post-mortem, and inquest 
report (Exh.PE). It has been noticed that in the inquest report (Exh.PE), the 
names of Sultan Ahmad (PW-7)-the complainant, Muhammad Khan (PW-
8), and Muhammad Younas (given up PW) have not been mentioned. Any 
eyewitnesses or the complainant does not sign the inquest report (Exh.PE). 
However, the investigating officer-Zafar Iqbal, S.I. (PW-9), has 
categorically asserted that he recorded statements of witnesses under section 
161 of Cr.P.C at the spot, which shows that witnesses were present at the 
place of occurrence. If he (PW-9) visited and prepared the inquest report 
(Exh. PE) and had met with Sultan Ahmad (PW-7)-the complainant, 
Muhammad Khan (PW-8), and Muhammad Younas (given up PW). In that 
case, there is no reason why the details we found missing from the inquest 
report (Exh.PE) should not have been there. The absence of those details 
indicates that the prosecution story was still in the embryo and had not been 
given any shape. The FIR was recorded after due deliberations and 
consultations, and FIR was then ante-timed. The second external check that 
is equally important is sending a copy of the FIR along with the dead body 
for post-mortem examination and its reference in the inquest report (Exh. 
PE). In the column of the brief history of the inquest report (Exh. PE), the 
investigating officer-Zafar Iqbal, S.I. (PW-9), specifically mentioned that he 
got registered an FIR, and its particulars were mentioned. Even then, it was 

Murder Reference No.129 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.44496-J of 2019 & 
Crl. Appeal No.37914 of 2019 
 
7
not mentioned that FIR was also sent along with other documents with the 
dead body for post-mortem examination. The absence of these details in the 
inquest report may indicate that the FIR was not registered and the FIR was 
recorded after due deliberations and consultation. In the inquest report (Exh. 
PE), it was mentioned as follows: -

Dr. Faisal Ramzan (PW-5), who conducted autopsy at 3:15 a.m. on 
19.11.2017, deposed during his examination-in-chief that: -  
“Ex.PC 
is 
the 
correct 
carbon 
copy 
of 
postmortem report, Ex.PC/1 and Ex.PC/2 are 
pictorial diagrams of injuries, prepared, signed 
and stamped by me. I also endorsed the injury 
statement Ex.PD and inquest report Ex.PE.” 
 
The FIR has lost its value and authenticity because of the above-said 
infirmities. It appears that the same has been ante-timed and had not been 
recorded till the inquest proceedings were over at the place of occurrence by 
the investigating officer-Zafar Iqbal, S.I. (PW-9). Jaleel-ur-Rehman 238-C 
(PW-10) deposed during cross-examination that:- 
“On receiving the information about the 
occurrence, I alongwith Zafar Iqbal SI and 
other police officials directly went at the place 
of occurrence. We did not stay in the way. 
When we reached at place of occurrence, SHO 
PS Khushab, DSP Saddar Circle Khushab and 
Members of Forensic Team were already at the 
place of occurrence.--------------IO handed over 
the dead body to me at 2:30 a.m. I reached at 
3:00 a.m. at hospital alongwith dead body.” 
 
 
Zafar Iqbal, S.I. (PW-9)-the investigating officer deposed 
during cross-examination that: -

Crl. Appeal No.37914 of 2019

“I received information of this occurrence near 
about 10:30 p.m on the fateful night. It is not in 
my knowledge as to whether the son of the 
complainant 
namely 
Ansar 
made 
a 
telephonically call at Rescue 15 at about 10:45 
p.m. or not. I reached at the place of occurrence 
at 12:45 a.m (night). I handed over the dead 
body of deceased to Jaleel ur Rehman 238/C for 
postmortem examination at about 2.00 a.m.” 
Zafar Iqbal, S.I. (PW-9)-the investigating officer to conceal a material fact 
from the Court, stated that it was not in his knowledge that the son of the 
complainant Ansar informed the police about the occurrence at Rescue 15 at 
10:45 p.m. In column No. 3 of the inquest report (Exh. PE), Zafar Iqbal, S.I. 
(PW-9)-the investigating officer mentioned the time of receiving 
information regarding the death at 10:40 p.m. on 18.11.2017. Muhammad 
Khan (PW-8) admitted that Ansar, the son of the complainant, reached the 
place of occurrence, and no other son came to the place of occurrence. 
Muhammad Khan (PW-8), in this regard, deposed during cross-examination 
that: - 
“Ansar son of complainant reached at the place 
of occurrence after the occurrence but I do not 
remember the exact time of his arrival. Except 
Ansar no other son of the complainant came at 
the 
place of occurrence. Sultan Ahmad 
complainant is my brother in law (Behnoee).” 
 
Contrary to the deposition of Muhammad Khan (PW-8), Sultan Ahmad 
(PW-7)-the complainant deposed during a court statement that his son 
Muhammad Shahbaz was in front of the room of cattle shed. Sultan Ahmad 
(PW-7)-the complainant admitted during cross-examination that:- 
“My son Ansar knew about the occurrence soon 
after the occurrence as he was present at the 
home which is at a distance of about half 
kilometer away from my dera. The police was 
informed about the occurrence at Rescue 15 but 
I do not know who made such call to the police. 
I do not know as to whether Ansar made call at 
Rescue 15 at 10.45 p.m or not. I also do not 
know as to whether Ansar made such call at 
Rescue 15 that some persons illegally occupied 
his land and also made firing at the dera.

Crl. Appeal No.44496-J of 2019 &

Volunteers soon after the occurrence, I went to 
the police to furnish the information about the 
occurrence. On the way, police met me at Bus 
stand Sandral and police informed me that 
police received call at Rescue 15 about the 
occurrence. I was on the way at that time, 
therefore, I do not know who made the call to 
the police at Rescue 15.” 
The defence produced defence-witness Altaf Hussain 2729/HC (DW-1). 
Altaf Hussain 2729/HC (DW-1) deposed during his examination-in-chief 
that: - 
“Under the order of the Court I have brought 
today the relevant record of rescue 15 dated 
18.11.2017 regarding the call of Ansar s/o 
Sultan Ahmad r/o Korra Tehsil & District 
Khushab. I have also brought record of call 
made from cell No.0302-6544945 which is 
Ex.DD/1-2 
duly 
attested 
by 
concerned 
authority.” 
 
A witness summoned by the trial court to produce a document shall bring it 
to the Court if it is in his possession or power. Altaf Hussain 2729/HC (DW-
1) is in charge of rescue 15, who produced records of daily dairy 
(roznamcha) of the call made on 15 (Ex.DD/1-2) revealing that caller Ansar 
made the call on 15 at 10:45 p.m. and informed that their opponents were 
making firing at their Dera and they occupied their Dera and asked for police 
help. At 12:55 a.m. (night), on return, Muhammad Arshad S.I. of police 
station Khushab reported that the accused persons killed Jabbar, son of 
Sultan Ahmad, and fled away after that. The deposition of Jalil-ur-Rehman 
238/C (PW-10) revealed that when they reached the place of occurrence, 
police officers of police station Khushab were present. The learned counsel 
for the complainant also admitted that Ansar, the complainant’s son, made 
the call on the 15. However, the complainant was not aware of it. There were 
so many omissions and contradictions in the evidence of prosecution 
witnesses affecting the entire fabric of the prosecution case.  
11. 
 
In the instant appeal, in the scaled site plans (Exh. PB and Exh. 
PB/1) place of firing was shown at points "2 and 3," and the deceased, i.e., 

Murder Reference No.129 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.44496-J of 2019 & 
Crl. Appeal No.37914 of 2019 
 
10
Muhammad Jabbar, was shown at point "1". The distance between Point "1" 
and Points "2 and 3" was 12 and 6 feet, respectively; from such a distance, 
blackening is impossible. Whereas, in the unscaled site plan (Exh. PI), the 
distance between Point "1" and Point "3" was not mentioned. The 
investigating officer-Zafar Iqbal, S.I. (PW-9), prepared an unscaled site plan 
(Exh. PI) and left blank space after writing as under:- 
 
 "جو مقام نمبر1 
"سے فاصلہ         فٹ جانب ہے 
Whereas, Dr. Faisal Ramzan (PW-5), who conducted autopsy on the dead 
body of Muhammad Jabbar, observed blackening on injury No.1. Dr. Faisal 
Ramzan (PW-5) deposed during cross-examination that: -  
“I extracted four pellets and one wad from the 
track/rout of injury No.1 and two pellets from 
the floor of mouth coming from injuries No.3 & 
4, whereas the seventh pellet was extracted 
from injury No.6. Injury No.6 is an independent 
injury.--------------I extracted single pellet from 
injury No.3, single pellet from injury No.4 and 
single pellet from injury No.6.--------------Injury 
No.1 is on cheek, whereas injuries No.3 & 4 are 
on chin.” 
 
The blackening and recovery of pellets from the wound and the seat of 
injuries show that Muhammad Jabbar sustained the fire shot injuries on the 
vital part of his body from a close range. There is an apparent conflict 
between the medical evidence and with ocular testimony delivered by the 
eyewitness. The fact, however, is that the deceased, i.e., Muhammad Jabbar 
received firearm injuries from close range, and who was responsible for the 
said wounds was not known; however, the appellant was not responsible for 
said wounds. Although the site plan is not a substantive piece of evidence in 
terms of Article 22 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, as held in the case 
of “Mst. Shamim Akhtar v. Fiaz Akhtar and two others” (PLD 1992 SC 
211) but it reflects the view of the crime scene. The same can be used to 
contradict or disbelieve eyewitnesses. Thus, there was an apparent conflict 
between the medical evidence and ocular testimony incapable of being 
reconciled by any amount of argument and persuasion. In these 

Murder Reference No.129 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.44496-J of 2019 & 
Crl. Appeal No.37914 of 2019 
 
11
circumstances, the presence of eyewitnesses at the place of occurrence has 
become highly doubtful.  
12. 
 
Another aspect of the case is that the occurrence occurred in the 
Dera/Cattle shed of Sultan Ahmad (PW-7)-the complainant. The presence of 
the witnesses, i.e., Sultan Ahmad (PW-7)-complainant, and Muhammad 
Khan (PW-8), was by chance. Sultan Ahmad (PW-7)-complainant stated the 
reason for his presence at his Dera was due to an ailment of buffalo, he was 
present at his Dera. Sultan Ahmad (PW-7)-complainant has specifically 
deposed in his court statement that: 
"On 18.11.2017 at about 10:40 p.m, I alongwith 
Muhammad Khan and Muhammad Younis 
were present at my dera to look after my ailing 
buffalo whereas my son Muhammad Shehbaz 
was present in front of room of cattle shed." 
Whereas, during cross-examination, he (PW-7) deposed that: - 
"At the time of occurrence I was present in 
garage (chappar). The said garage (chappar) 
was open from three sides. Although ailing 
buffalo had to save from cold weather, however, 
the said buffalo due to ailment, sit in the said 
garage/chapper at Asar time and then remained 
unable to stand on legs. Due to this reason, we 
were present in the said garage/chapper at the 
time 
of 
occurrence. 
We 
used 
the 
said 
garage/chapper for multiple purposes i.e. to 
park the tractor, tethered the animals and also 
for sitting purposes.” 
Muhammad Khan (PW-8), eye witness and brother-in-law of the 
complainant, deposed during cross-examination that:- 
“My residence is not at the dera of complainant 
i.e place of occurrence. I am not veterinary 
doctor." 
Zafer Iqbal S.I. (PW-9)-investigating officer deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“I did not mention in my spot inspection note 
about the presence of sick buffalo in the garage. 

Murder Reference No.129 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.44496-J of 2019 & 
Crl. Appeal No.37914 of 2019 
 
12
I drafted the unscaled plan on the pointation of 
the witnesses. I also did not mention the 
presence of sick buffalo in the garage in my 
unscale site plan Ex.PI.” 
Muhammad Zahoor, Patwari (PW-3) deposed during cross-examination 
that:- 
“I did not point out the presence of any sick 
buffalo in the garage where PWs were present. 
It is correct that I did not point out the presence 
of any cattle in two cattle shed at the place of 
occurrence. When I visited venue of crime, the 
garage was vacant.” 
 
When for the presence, if witnesses took the specific plea, there must be an 
explanation for their presence there. The deposition of a chance witness 
whose presence at the place of the incident remains doubtful should be 
discarded. Conduct of the chance witness after the incident may also be 
considered, particularly the condition of the dead body of the deceased. Dr. 
Faisal Ramzan (PW-5) deposed during examination-in-chief that: - 
“------mouth and eye were opened---” 
The same is reflected in column No. 8 of the inquest report (Exh. PE).  
"منہ اور آنکھیں قدرے کھلی ہوئیں"
 
Both these witnesses deposed in their court statements that they attended 
Muhammad Jabbar, who succumbed to the injuries on the spot. If they 
attended to the deceased soon after the occurrence, there was no reason for 
the mouth and eyes to be open. Although Muhammad Khan (PW-8), the eye 
witness, deposed during cross-examination, he tried to close the eyes and 
mouth of the deceased but could not succeed. At this juncture, it is relevant 
to mention the chemical changes that would occur when the dead body of a 
human being is exposed to different environmental situations. Autolysis 
(self-destruction) is an intrinsic activity brought about by the breakdown of 
cells and tissues of the human body because of the constituents of the said 
cells. The cell membranes break down after death and release enzymes that 
start self-digestion. The first external sign of autolysis is the whitish

Crl. Appeal No.37914 of 2019

appearance of the cornea. One of the first visible signs of death is when the 
eyes cloud over, a result of fluids and oxygen no longer flowing to the 
corneas. That can begin within 10 minutes of death. If the deceased person’s 
eyes remain open at the time of death, any relative or person nearby can 
close the eyes soon after, as after 10 minutes, the decomposition process 
begins. It is relevant to mention here that Zafar Iqbal S.I. (PW-9)-
investigating officer, after reaching the place of occurrence, inspected the 
dead body, prepared an injury statement (Ex. PD), inquest report (Ex. PE) 
and photographs of the dead body of the deceased were also taken, and 
photo-card (P-7) containing four pictures of deceased were secured and 
genuineness of which is not denied by prosecution or complainant. The 
deceased was in the knee-chest position, the body was lying on his side, and 
the torso was lying diagonally. This also suggested that Sultan Ahmad (PW-
7)-the complainant, and Muhammad Khan (PW-8) were not present at the 
time of occurrence. It suggests that if Sultan Ahmad (PW-7)-the 
complainant, and Muhammad Khan (PW-8), an eye witness, were present at 
the place of occurrence and tried to close the eyes and mouth of the deceased 
and also straighten the dead body of the deceased, then there was no reason 
the same should be closed and a dead body lying in the straight position. 
Thus, Sultan Ahmad (PW-7)-the complainant, and Muhammad Khan (PW-
8) failed to prove their presence on the spot. Such evidence can be created at 
any moment. With this background, the presence of the alleged eyewitnesses 
in the place seems to be doubtful. 
13. 
 
According to Sultan Ahmad (PW-7)-the complainant, and 
Muhammad Khan (PW-8), two charging lights were lit at the time of 
occurrence. In the cross-examination, the defence has brought omissions, 
contradictions, and improvements in the evidence of this witness. Sultan 
Ahmad (PW-7)-the complainant deposed during cross-examination that:- 
“I also stated before the police officer about 
charging lights in my statement but I do not 
know as to whether the police recorded the 
same or not. Confronted with Ex.PF, wherein it 
is also not so recorded.”

Zafar Iqbal S.I. (PW-9)-investigating officer deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“It is correct that in the statement of the 
complainant Ex.PF, the factum of lightening of 
charging lights at the time of occurrence is not 
mentioned.” 
Whereas, Muhammad Zahoor, Patwari (PW-3) deposed during cross-
examination that:- 
“It is correct that I did not show the source of 
light, bulb in the garage, however, a charging 
light was hanging at the front guarder of garage 
in the middle.” 
The charging lights are not a source of light recorded in the FIR (Ex. PA). 
The charging lights (P-1 and P-2) produced in the court were new. 
Muhammad Khan (PW-8) deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“The charging lights P-1 & P-2 are seem to be 
new. Volunteers the same were taken into 
possession in my presence.” 
 
Zafar Iqbal S.I. (PW-9)-investigating officer deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“I am serving in police department for the last 
32 years. I cannot tell as to whether the electric 
bulbs become hot after remained lightening for 
some time. I do not remember as to whether the 
recovered charging lights, P-1 & P-2, were 
wrapped in plastic cover or not. At this stage, 
charging lights P-1 & P-2 are shown to the 
witness and he admitted it correct that the same 
are covered with plastic paper on front side.” 
 
Jaleel-ur-Rehman 238/C (PW-10) deposed during cross-examination that:- 
“I did not see any charging lights hanging with 
the walls of room and garage, however, the 
charging lights were holding in hands by the 
people present at the spot.”

The statements about the source of light are not consistent. The statements of 
the prosecution witnesses do not support the FIR about the source of light. 
They are contradictory. In view of the preceding discussion, we think that 
the evidence adduced by the prosecution does not establish that there was 
any source of light when the incident allegedly took place. 
14. 
 
The motive set up by the prosecution in the Fard Beyan (Exh. 
PF) and F.I.R. (Exh. PA), brought on the record through the deposition of 
Mukhtar Ahmad (PW-6), Sultan Ahmad (PW-7)-complainant and 
Muhammad Khan (PW-8) is that about 1½ years before the occurrence, the 
daughter of Manzoor Ahmad (the appellant), namely Aneetan Manzoor 
eloped with one Muhammad Imran, and the accused had a suspicion that the 
complainant party had facilitated and helped the elopement of said Aneetan 
Manzoor with Muhammad Imran; due to that grudge, the accused had 
murdered Muhammad Jabbar (the deceased). To substantiate the motive part 
of the case, the prosecution produced Mukhtar Ahmad (PW-6). In the cross-
examination of Mukhtar Ahmad (PW-6), some omissions, contradictions, 
and improvements have been brought on record by the defence, which is as 
under: - 
“I got recorded in my police statement that 
Jabbar used to visit the house of accused 
Manzoor but I do not know as to whether IO 
recorded it or not. Confronted with Ex.DA, 
where it is not so recorded. I also got recorded 
in my police statement that accused persons had 
suspicion that Jabbar was also involved in the 
matter of abduction of Aneeta Manzoor with 
Imran. Confronted with Ex.DA, where it is not 
so recorded.” 
 
Zafar Iqbal S.I. (PW-9)-investigating officer deposed during cross-
examination about the motive part of the occurrence as under: - 
“It is correct that under the motive part of 
complaint Ex.PF, the name of Muhammad 
Jabbar deceased is not specifically mentioned. 
Volunteers that it is mentioned in the motive 
part that the accused party had suspicion upon

Crl. Appeal No.37914 of 2019

us. I correctly recorded the statements of 
Muhammad Khan and Muhammad Younis 
PWs. It is correct that according to the 
statements 
of 
Muhammad 
Khan 
and 
Muhammad Younis PWs recorded by me, u/s 
161 
Cr.P.C, 
the 
motive 
is 
ascribed 
to 
Muhammad Mukhtar only. Volunteers that 
Muhammad Mukhtar is the real uncle of 
Muhammad Jabbar deceased.” 
 
To whom the motive was attributed has not stated that he (PW-6) received 
threats from the appellant. The testimony of Mukhtar Ahmad (PW-6) 
revealed that Aneetan, the daughter of Manzoor Ahmad, went to the house 
of Muhammad Imran on 18.11.2015. During cross-examination, Mukhtar 
Ahmad (PW-6) admitted that Manzoor Ahmad had not caused murderous 
assault or damage to his family members, although they were residing in the 
village. Mukhtar Ahmad (PW-6) deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“During inventing period from 18.11.2015 till 
the date of occurrence of this case i.e. 
19.11.2017, I visited my village many times but I 
used to visit my village secretly due to fear of 
Manzoor Ahmad because he used to threatened 
me. I did not got register any FIR against 
Manzoor Ahmad regarding above said threat. 
My family members are residing at village. 
None had killed my son. No murderous assault 
was committed upon my any family member. I 
do not offer the funeral prayer of Jabbar 
deceased, because I was in Karachi on that day 
and came to my village on the next day of death 
of Jabbar.” 
 
Contrary to the deposition of Mukhtar Ahmad (PW-6), Sultan Ahmad (PW-
7)-the complainant deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“Prior to this occurrence, neither Mukhtar 
Ahmad nor any his other family members was 
murdered by the accused. Volunteered the 
accused made three murderous assaults upon 
Mukhtar Ahmad but he remained save due to 
his luck. Due to fear of his death, later on he 
went to Karachi. We did not lodge any FIR 
regarding 
the 
murderous 
assaults 
upon 
Mukhtar Ahmad. The accused did not murder

the sons of Mukhtar Ahmad. Volunteer one of 
his son is minor and we did care his other sons.”  
 
Muhammad Khan (PW-8) deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“I stated before the IO that Muhammad Jabbar 
and Mukhtar Ahmad facilitated Imran in 
elopement of Mst. Aneetan Manzoor with him. 
Confronted with Ex.DC, wherein only the name 
of Mukhtar is mentioned.”  
 
There are contradictions between the statements of Mukhtar Ahmad (PW-6) 
and Sultan Ahmad (PW-7)-the complainant. The inconsistencies above in 
the statements are material and raise doubt or suspicion in the prosecution 
case about the motive for committing the occurrence. We believe the 
prosecution has been unable to establish a motive in the instant case. 
15. 
 
So far as recovery of the weapon of offence, i.e., gun 12-bore 
repeater (P-8), one bandolier (P-9), four live cartridges (P-10/1-4), and one 
magazine (P-11/1-2) from the possession of the accused/appellant and 
positive report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency (Ex. PQ), are concerned, 
as per the prosecution case, on 21.12.2017, the accused was arrested from 
village Kora Pattan. On 02.01.2018, upon his disclosure, a gun 12-bore 
repeater (P-8), one bandolier (P-9), four live cartridges (P-10/1-4), and one 
magazine (P-11/1-2) were recovered from his residence. Muhammad Fayyaz 
S.I. (PW-11)-the investigating officer secured the same through a recovery 
memo (Ex.PL). Muhammad Fayyaz S.I. (PW-11)-the investigating officer 
deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“As per record the gun was recovered from the 
accused at about 12.00 p.m. (noon) on 
02.1.2018.”  
Contrary to the deposition of Muhammad Fayyaz S.I. (PW-11)-the 
investigating officer, Jaleel-ur-Rehman 238/C HIC (PW-10)-recovery 
witness, deposed during cross-examination that: 
 “It is correct that on 02.1.2018, at about 7.00 
a.m., I left the police station PS Sadar 
Jauharabad with Rana Asif SHO for PS Katha 

Murder Reference No.129 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.44496-J of 2019 & 
Crl. Appeal No.37914 of 2019 
 
18
Saghral and I returned back alongwith him at 
evening time.”  
The deposition of Jaleel-ur-Rehman 238/C HIC (PW-10)-recovery witness 
creates doubts about the recovery of the weapon of offence, i.e., gun 12-bore 
repeater (P-8), one bandolier (P-9), four live cartridges (P-10/1-4), and one 
magazine (P-11/1-2). Besides, after completing the proceedings at the spot, 
Zafar Iqbal S.I. (PW-9)-investigating officer- searched for the accused. Zafar 
Iqbal S.I. (PW-9)-investigating officer deposed during examination-in-chief 
as under: - 
“I also joined into investigation the other 
persons available at the spot. Thereafter, I went 
in search of the accused persons, which could 
not be arrested.”  
 
It does not appeal to the prudent mind that the accused would conceal the 
gun 12-bore repeater (P-8), one bandolier (P-9), four live cartridges (P-10/1-
4), and one magazine (P-11/1-2) in his residential Dera to hand it over to the 
police on his arrest. It creates doubt about the recovery of the gun 12-bore 
repeater (P-8), one bandolier (P-9), four live cartridges (P-10/1-4), and one 
magazine (P-11/1-2). Whereas it is the defence version that the police 
officers serving in the police department at the DPO office, Khushab, on the 
next day of the occurrence, took into possession a shotgun along with the 
license of co-accused Khan Muhammad (since acquitted). Then the same 
was planted against them. In the presence of the statement of Jaleel-ur-
Rehman 238/C HIC (PW-10)-the recovery witness throws clouds on the 
recovery of the testimony of gun 12-bore repeater (P-8), one bandolier (P-9), 
four live cartridges (P-10/1-4), and one magazine (P-11/1-2). In these 
circumstances, the recovery of the weapon of offence and a positive report 
are not of any consequence. 
16. 
 
As it is difficult to rely upon the testimonies of PWs 6, 7, and 8 
and for other reasons enumerated hereinbefore, we are persuaded to hold 
that the prosecution had not been able to prove its case against the appellant 
beyond any shadow of a doubt as there were many dents in the prosecution 

Murder Reference No.129 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.44496-J of 2019 & 
Crl. Appeal No.37914 of 2019

story.  The conviction and sentence learned trial court recorded could not be 
sustained. It is held in the case of “Muhammad Akram v. The State” 
(2009 SCMR 230) that:- 
“It is an axiomatic principle of law that in case 
of doubt, the benefit thereof must accrue in 
favour of the accused as matter of right and not 
of grace. It was observed by this Court in the 
case of “Tariq Pervez v. The State” (1995 
SCMR 1345) that for giving the benefit of 
doubt, it was not necessary that there should be 
many circumstances creating doubts. If there is 
circumstance which created reasonable doubt 
in a prudent mind about the guilt of the 
accused, then the accused would be entitled to 
the benefit of doubt not as a matter of grace and 
concession but as a matter of right.” 
 
17. 
 
In light of the above discussion, we affirm that the prosecution 
has failed to prove its case against the appellant beyond any shadow of a 
doubt. Therefore, we accept the instant Criminal Appeal No.44496 of 2019 
filed by Manzoor Ahmad, appellant, set aside his conviction and sentence 
recorded by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Khushab, vide judgment 
dated 02.05.2019 and acquit him of the charge in the case F.I.R. No.396 of 
2017 dated 19.11.2017 under Sections 302/34 PPC, at Police Station 
Khushab and he is directed to be released forthwith if not required in any 
other case. Murder Reference No.129 of 2019 is answered in the negative, 
and the sentence of death awarded to Manzoor Ahmad, son of Chanan Khan, 
Caste Korra, resident of village Korra, Tehsil and District Khushab, is not 
confirmed. 
18. 
 
So far as CRIMINAL APPEAL No.37914 of 2019 seeking a 
conviction under section 302 (b) P.P.C. of respondent No.2-Khan 
Muhammad is concerned, we have noted that the respondent No.2-Khan 
Muhammad was attributed the role of lalkara, and no injury was attributed to 
him towards the deceased or prosecution witnesses.  For what has been 
discussed above in the light of prosecution, medical, and documentary 
evidence, the acquittal of respondent No.2-Khan Muhammad does not suffer 
from any illegality to call for our interference with the impugned judgment 

Murder Reference No.129 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.44496-J of 2019 & 
Crl. Appeal No.37914 of 2019 
 
20
to the extent of respondent No.2. We have also taken note of the settled 
principle of criminal jurisprudence that unless it can be shown that the lower 
court’s judgment is perverse or that it is completely illegal. No other 
conclusion can be drawn except the guilt of the accused or misreading or 
non-reading of evidence resulting into a miscarriage of justice. Even 
otherwise, when a court of competent jurisdiction acquits the accused, the 
double presumption of innocence is attached to his case.  The acquittal order 
cannot be interfered with, whereby an accused earns double presumption of 
innocence as held in Muhammad Mansha Kausar v. Muhammad Ashgar 
and others (2003 SCMR 477).  In this case, the prosecution has not been 
able to bring on record adequate incriminating evidence against respondent 
No.2, which connects him with the alleged crime.  The learned trial Judge 
has advanced valid and plausible reasons for recording acquittal in favor of 
respondent No.2. The judgment of acquittal does not call for any 
interference. Consequently, we find no merit in this Criminal Appeal 
bearing No.37914 of 2019, which is, as a result of this, dismissed as being 
without merits.
