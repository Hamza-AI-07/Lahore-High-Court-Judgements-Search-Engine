                 (JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT) 
R.F.A.No.52942 of 2022 
     Afzaal Ahmed Vs.  Sadia Safdar and another 
JUDGMENT 
 
 
 
 
MUHAMMAD RAZA QURESHI, J. This Regular First 
Appeal has been preferred to call into question the legality, 
findings and reasons contained in the impugned judgment and 
decree dated 22.06.2022 passed by the learned Civil Judge 1st 
Class, Phalia whereby suit for recovery of damages of 59,000,000/- 
for malicious prosecution filed by the appellant was dismissed by 
the learned Trial Court. 
2. 
The facts culminating into the impugned judgment and 
decree emanate from the subject matter suit which was filed by the 
appellant against respondents No.1 and 2 on the ground that after 
giving divorce to respondent No.1, she lodged a private complaint 
against him titled Sadia Safdar vs Afzal Ahmad etc.  with frivolous 
allegations from which ultimately the appellant stood acquitted. As 
per contents of the plaint the appellant suffered from business 
losses for which he claimed damages for Rs.5,000,000/-, for mental 
agony Rs.3,500,000/-, for tarnishing reputation and defaming him 
Rs.50,000,000/- were claimed as damages whereas Rs.500,000/- 
were claimed as miscellaneous expenses. As per contents of the 
plaint the appellant claimed that since the respondent No.1 his ex-
wife had levelled false allegations against him, therefore, the suit 
was also liable to be decreed against her. The suit was contested by 
the respondents and learned Trial Court through order dated 
19.01.2021 framed as many as following four issues:-

3. 
After completion of trial, learned Trial Court arrived at a 
conclusion that the appellant had failed to prove his case and as a 
consequence thereof dismissed the subject matter suit. 
 
4. 
According to learned counsel for the appellant the impugned 
judgment and decree is illegal and unlawful and same is liable to be 
set aside. Contends that learned Court below misread the evidence 
on record and failed to appreciate the fact that the appellant stood 
acquitted from the criminal proceedings initiated at the behest of 
respondent No.1. According to learned counsel the impugned 
judgment and decree is liable to be set aside. Learned counsel for 
the appellant in support of his arguments relied upon the case law 
cited 
as 
Mumtaz 
Ali 
Shah 
vs. 
Chairman, 
Pakistan 
Telecommunication Company Ltd., H.Q., Islamabad and 6 others 
(PLD 2002 SC 1060) and Muhammad Yousaf vs. Abdul Qayyum 
(PLD 2016 SC 478). 
 
5. 
Conversely learned counsel for respondents submits that the 
appellant not only failed to substantiate his claim for damages but 
also failed to prove that he was maliciously prosecuted. According 
to learned counsel, respondent No.1 rightly lodged a complaint 
against the appellant who failed to establish that initiation of such 
proceedings had an element of malice.  
 
6. 
Arguments of learned counsel for the parties have been 
heard, record of appeal as well as lower Court has been perused, 
the pleadings of the parties have been examined and the oral as 
well as documentary evidence has been analyzed by us.

7. 
The canvass framed by the appellant by laying a challenge to 
the impugned judgment and decree revolves around resolution of 
scope and ambit of a suit for malicious prosecution. Therefore, it is 
important to note that in order to succeed in an action for malicious 
prosecution, the plaintiff must in the first instance prove (i) that the 
action was actuated by malice (ii) that the initiator acted without 
reasonable and probable cause (iii) that the plaintiff was prosecuted 
by the defendant on a criminal charge (iv) that the prosecution 
terminated in favour of the plaintiff (v) that the proceedings had 
interfered with plaintiff's liberty and had also affected his/her 
reputation, and (vi) that the plaintiff had suffered damages. To 
succeed in a case for malicious prosecution all these ingredients 
must coexist. Reliance in this regard is placed on Raja Braja Sunder 
Deb versus Bamdeb Das (AIR 1944 PC 1), Abdul Rasheed versus 
State Bank of Pakistan and another (PLD 1970 Karachi 344), 
United Bank Limited and 5 others versus Raja Ghulam Hussain and 
4 others (1999 SCMR 734) and Muhammad Yousaf versus Abdul 
Qayyum (PLD 2016 Supreme Court 478). Therefore, this Court 
has to examine whether the test of co-existence of ingredients were 
satisfied by the appellant/plaintiff. 
 
8.  
While deciding this Appeal, the Court has also to strike a 
balance between two parties as the initiator of a criminal proceedings 
has freedom of action against a wrong and to set law in motion to 
bring criminal to justice without a fear of being prosecuted in case of 
being unsuccessful. In contrast the rights and protection of an 
innocent party who is being victimized by misuse of the process 
of law and possibly that is why, in the wisdom of Raja  Braja Sunder 
Deb's case supra, the fundamental ingredient considered by Privy 
Council was a  malicious defendant and an action without reasonable 
and  probable cause as according to Privy Council the malice has 
been  set to mean  any  wrong  or  indirect  motive, but  a  prosecution 
is not  malicious  merely  because  it is inspired by anger. However, 
wrongheaded prosecutor may be if he honestly thinks that the 
accused 
has 
been 
guilty 
of 
a 
criminal 
offence  

-4- 
                 R.F.A.No.52942 of 2022 
 
 
he cannot be initiator of malicious prosecution. But malice alone is 
not enough, there must also be shown to be absence of reasonable and 
probable cause. It is to be proved by the plaintiff that the prosecution 
was initiated without any justifiable reason and it was due to 
malicious intention of the defendant and not with the mere intention 
to carry law into effect.  
 
9. 
In the facts and circumstances, the merits of the case and 
evidence led by respective parties are to be evaluated on the 
touchstone of principles of law mentioned above. The appellant did 
not appear in the witness box and presented his two witnesses 
namely; Mahammad Inayat being his Special Attorney and Sarfraz 
Ahmad as PW-1 and PW-2 respectively. It is pertinent to mention 
here that both the witnesses appearing on behalf of appellant did not 
produce any documentary evidence and all the documents exhibited 
during course of arguments were adduced in statement of learned 
counsel for the appellant. During the cross-examination PW-1 
candidly conceded that in nikahnama the appellant was mentioned 
as bachelor, which was contrary to the fact as in cross-examination 
PW-1 conceded that appellant got married thrice, however, he 
divorced all the wives. PW-1 also admitted that he did not produce 
any evidence on record with respect to abortion by respondent No.1. 
The plaint of the suit throughout reflected that the reason for 
divorcing respondent No.1 was her voluntary abortion of first child 
conceived by her out of wedlock of appellant and respondent No.1. 
 
10. 
In witness box throughout the appellant failed to produce any 
document  on  record to substantiate  that  respondent No.1 got 
aborted her pregnancy. The  perusal  of  private  complaint  reflects 
that the sole ground agitated by respondent No.1 to lodge a private 
complaint  was  fraudulent  conduct of appellant to present himself 
as bachelor at the time of  nikah  and  since  upon  attaining  
knowledge  the respondent  No.1  obtained  divorce, therefore, she 
filed a private  complaint. The perusal Exh.P-5 which  is  a 
judgment passed by Magistrate Section 30, Phalia  reflects  that  
the  Court did  not declare  that complaint  filed  by  respondent 

-5- 
                 R.F.A.No.52942 of 2022 
 
 
No.1 was false and frivolous rather while acquitting the appellant 
from the charge the appellant was given benefit of doubt due to 
weak evidence presented by the prosecution. 
11. 
All these facts were duly considered by learned Court below 
and rightly evaluated that the co-existence of the ingredients meant 
to initiate malicious prosecution were not established in the facts 
and circumstances of the case. Co-existence of all those ingredients 
was a condition precedent to maintain the suit and appellant failed 
to prove through his witnesses any malice in initiating of private 
complaint against him. The perusal of evidence specially the 
judgment rendered by the Judicial Magistrate clearly prove one 
thing that the initiation of criminal proceedings against the appellant 
was based on reasonable or probable cause. Reliance is placed upon 
judgment reported as Abdul Majaeed Khan vs. Tawseen Abdul Haleem 
and others (2012 CLD 6). 
 
12. 
The cause of action claimed in the Suit had its genesis in 
initiation of criminal proceedings by the Respondent No.1, but mere 
fact that prosecution instituted by respondent/defendant against the 
plaintiff ultimately failed, cannot expose the former to effect the 
malicious prosecution, unless it is proved by the plaintiff that the 
prosecution was initiated without any reasonable and probable cause 
and it was due to malicious intention of the defendant and not with a 
mere intention of carrying the law into effect. Reliance in this 
respect is placed upon the judgment reported as Subedar (Retd.) 
Fazale Rahim vs. Rab Nawaz (1999 SCMR 700). 
 
13. 
In  addition thereto, the  claim  for damages in the case of 
malicious prosecution carries two  facets  relating to (i) general 
damages and (ii) special damages. The  general  damages  refers to 
special  character,  condition or  circumstances  which  accrue  from 
immediate,  direct and  approximate result of wrong 
complained of. Special damages follow as a natural and 
approximate  consequence  in  a  particular case  by reason of 
special circumstances or condition. In the instant  case  the  
appellant  failed to substantiate on record through cogent and 

-6- 
                 R.F.A.No.52942 of 2022 
 
 
unimpeachable evidence for award of general damages and in this 
regard only examination-in-chief of witnesses is valueless. So far as 
special damages are concerned, for that he had to prove that all the 
ingredients of malicious prosecution had co-existed to establish his 
claim of damages which throughout he could not prove. 
 
14. 
The learned Trial Court while deciding issue No.1 took all 
legal aspects into consideration and rightly arrived at a conclusion 
that the appellant had failed to establish his claim for malicious 
prosecution and his evidence was bereft of any substance with 
respect to damages. The said damages in the case of malicious 
prosecution could only be awarded on production of strict proof 
thereof by the claimant and since the appellant failed to establish his 
case of malicious prosecution, therefore, the standard or quantum of 
said damages does not arise at all. Reliance in this respect is placed 
upon the case law cited as Abdul Rauf vs. Abdul Razzak and another 
(PLD 1994 SC 476). 
 
15. 
The upshot of the above discussion is that we are not 
persuaded that while passing the impugned judgment and decree the 
learned Trial Court had committed any illegality and therefore the 
same do not warrant any interference  by us. Consequently, this 
Appeal is dismissed with no order as to cost.
