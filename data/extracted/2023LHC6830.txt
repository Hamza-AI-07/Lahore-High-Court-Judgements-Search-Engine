Mirza Viqas Rauf, J. This petition under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 assails the vires of 
order dated 9th December, 2022, whereby the learned Additional District 
Judge, Rawalpindi, while dismissing the revision petition filed by the 
petitioners, affirmed the order dated 19th May, 2022 passed by the learned 
Civil Judge Class-I, Rawalpindi. 
2.  
Facts in brief necessary for adjudication of instant petition are 
that a suit for declaration was instituted by respondents No.1 to 3 
(hereinafter referred to as “respondents”) showing the petitioner No.1 as 
one of plaintiffs therein averring that they are legal heirs of Arif Hussain, 
who died on 9th November, 2018 and after his death, they are only legal 
heirs to be entitled for the legacy of the deceased. Suit was decreed ex-
parte vide judgment dated 19th March, 2019. The petitioners, on attaining 
the knowledge, moved an application under section 12 (2) of the Code of 
Civil Procedure (V of 1908) (hereinafter referred to as “CPC”) seeking 
annulment of the judgment and decree on the ground that name of 
petitioner No.1 was though reflected in the plaint as plaintiff No.1 but 
actually she never filed the suit and all the proceedings were conducted by

respondent No.1 without any authorization and ultimately succeeded in 
obtaining an ex-parte decree, which is detrimental to the rights of the 
petitioners. The application was resisted by the “respondents” and in view 
of divergent stance taken by both the sides, the trial Court proceeded to 
frame issues and fix the matter for evidence of the petitioners. The 
petitioners then moved an application for summoning 
of the 
Superintendent, Abandoned Babies & Destitute Children Home, 
Rawalpindi as court witness. The trial Court, by way of order dated 19th 
May, 2022 not only dismissed the said application but also dismissed the 
application under section 12 (2) “CPC”. Feeling dissatisfied, the 
petitioners though filed revision petition before the learned Additional 
District Judge but of no avail as the revision petition was also dismissed 
through order dated 9th December, 2022.  
 3.  
Learned counsel for the petitioners contended that ex-parte 
decree was obtained through misrepresentation. He added that on 
attaining the knowledge, the petitioner moved an application under section 
12 (2) “CPC” upon which the trial Court framed necessary issues. 
Submitted that on moving the application for summoning of witness, the 
trial Court adjourned the proceedings for 19th May, 2022 for arguments on 
the said application but on the date fixed not only the miscellaneous 
application was dismissed but the main application was also turned down. 
Learned counsel emphasizes that since the main petition was not fixed for 
the said date, so at the most the trial Court could dismiss the miscellaneous 
application. It is contended that despite patent illegality committed by the 
trial Court, the revisional Court failed to exercise the jurisdiction and only 
played the role of post office. In order to supplement his contentions, 
learned counsel placed reliance on Qazi MUHAMMAD TARIQ v. HASIN 
JAHAN and 3 others (1993 SCMR 1949). 
4.  
Conversely, learned counsel representing the “respondents” 
submitted that the Courts below did not commit any illegality warranting 
interference by this Court in constitutional jurisdiction. He added that the 
application under section 12(2) “CPC” was totally misconceived and as 
such rightly dismissed. Learned counsel has placed reliance on Mst. LAILA

W.P.No.1475 of 2023 
 
 
 
QAYYUM v. FAWAD QAYUM and others (PLD 2019 Supreme Court 
449).  
5.  
Heard. Record perused. 
6.  
Suit was shown to be filed by the “respondents” alongwith 
petitioner No.1. The matter in issue canvassed in the suit was relatable to 
the estate of Arif Hussain, who died on 9th November, 2018. Suit was 
decreed ex-parte vide judgment dated 19th March, 2019. The petitioners, 
on attaining the knowledge about the ex-parte decree, moved an 
application under section 12 (2) “CPC” asserting therein that though 
name of petitioner No.1 was reflected in the suit but actually she never 
appeared before the Court and all the proceedings were conducted by 
respondent No.1 without any authorization and while practicing fraud and 
misrepresentation she succeeded in getting the suit decreed ex-parte. The 
application was resisted by the “respondents” who submitted their reply. 
After examining counter claims of the parties, the learned Civil Judge 
proceeded to frame issues by way of order dated 18th December, 2020. For 
the purpose  of convenience, relevant part of order is reproduced below: - 
“2. 
Perusal of record shows that it is contention of petitioners 
that Muhammad Ali was not real son of deceased Muhammad Arif Hussain, 
rather, he was adopted son of Muhammad Arif Hussain, so, decree holders 
did not become legal heirs of deceased Muhammad Arif Hussain but they 
have fraudulently succeeded to get decree for declaration/ legal heirship 
dated 19.03.2019. In support of their version, petitioners have annexed report 
of Superintendent, Abandoned Babies & Destitute Children Home, 
Rawalpindi and attestation report of Magistrate dated 29.09.1985, whereas 
respondents relied on nikkahnama of deceased Muhammad Ali, family 
registration certificate issued by NADRA & CNIC of deceased Muhammad 
Ali. Both the parties have documents  in pro & contra in support of their 
versions, so, contentions of both the parties requires evidence, therefore, out 
of divergent pleadings of the parties, following issues are hereby framed: 
ISSUES 
(i) 
Whether impugned judgment & decree dated 19.03.2019 is 
liable to be set aside on the ground mentioned in petition? 
OPA 
(ii) 
Whether this petition is not maintainable and liable to be 
dismissed? OPR 
(iii) 
Relief. 
 
(underlining supplied for emphasis) 
7.  
The petitioners in the process of producing their evidence, 
moved an application for summoning of concerned officer of the office of 

4 
 
 
 
W.P.No.1475 of 2023 
 
 
 
the Superintendent, Abandoned Babies & Destitute Children Home, 
Rawalpindi as court witness. It is apparent from the record that on the date 
prior to the date when the application under section 12(2) “CPC” was 
dismissed alongwith miscellaneous application, the proceedings were 
adjourned only for the arguments on miscellaneous application. There thus 
remains no cavil at all that on 19th May, 2022 when the impugned order 
was passed, application under section 12 (2) “CPC” was not fixed for 
hearing.  
8.  
It is an oft-repeated principle of law that whenever some 
miscellaneous application is pending before the Court, it shall decide the 
same in the first stance before finalizing the lis and passing the final 
order/judgment. Failure to decide the miscellaneous application before 
passing the final verdict would render the same nullity in the eye of law. To 
this effect, one can seek guidance from the case of MUHAMMAD UMER 
vs. MUHAMMAD QASIM and another (1991 SCMR 1232). The relevant 
extract from the same is reproduced below: -  
“6. The same point has been urged before us. The learned Civil Judge 
while dismissing the suit of the petitioner mainly relied upon the order 
of the Deputy Land Commissioner whereby the land allotted in the 
name of the petitioner was cancelled. But this order of cancellation 
was set at naught by the Land Commissioner. As per the record, the 
petitioner sought to produce the same vide application made under 
Order XLI, rule 27, C.P.C., and we think that once the Appellate Court 
was seized of the matter, i.e. the application under Order XLI, rule 27, 
C.P.C., it ought to have adjudicated upon the same before disposing of 
the appeal. In support of his case, the learned counsel for the petitioner 
had rightly relied upon the decision of this Court reported as Amina 
Begum v. Ghulam Dastgir (PLD 1978 SC 220) wherein it was held:--  
“Indeed in our considered opinion a discretion is 
vested in this behalf in the Courts to be judicially 
exercised in proper cases in order to avoid 
multiplicity of proceedings, to shorten litigation, and 
to do complete justice between the parties and mold 
the relief according to the altered circumstances in the 
larger interest of justice.”  
Further, we do not find any negligence on the part of the petitioner in 
bringing to the notice of the trial Court the order of the Land 
Commissioner. The order of the Land Commissioner could not be 
brought on the file of the trial Court because the same was under 
review before the Commissioner and the final order was passed by 
him on 15-10-1987 when the matter stood decided in the trial Court.”

W.P.No.1475 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
Reference to the above effect can also be made to MUHAMMAD YOUSUF 
and 12 others vs. ABDUL KHALIQ and others (1991 SCMR 1981) and 
Mst. IMTIAZ BEGUM v. Mst. SULTAN JAN and others (2008 SCMR 
1259). 
9.  
So far judgment in the case of Mst. LAILA QAYYUM v. FAWAD 
QAYUM and others (supra) is concerned, in the said case, the matter in 
issue was related to the paternity of a child for the determination of which 
an application seeking a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) test was moved, 
which was allowed by the trial Court, which order was, however, set aside 
by the appellate Court and ultimately when the matter went before the 
Peshawar High Court, the order of the appellate Court was set aside while 
restoring the order of the trial Court. The matter then went to the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan, it was thus held that in terms of Article 128 of the 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, suit was barred and, in this background, 
suit was also dismissed. The facts in the said case were thus not alike to the 
present case. Even otherwise, the proposition in hand is fully covered int 
the light of law laid down in Qazi MUHAMMAD TARIQ v. HASIN JAHAN 
and 3 others (1993 SCMR 1949). 
10.  
For the foregoing reasons, this petition is allowed. As a result 
thereof, orders dated 9th December, 2022 as well as 19th May, 2022 passed 
by the learned Additional District Judge and learned Civil Judge are set 
aside. Consequently, the application under section 12 (2) of “CPC” shall 
be deemed to be pending before the learned Senior Civil  Judge (Civil 
Division), Rawalpindi, who shall decide the same afresh on its own merits, 
strictly  in accordance with law.  
11.  
Needless to observe that if the Court seized with the matter is of 
the view that the application can be decided while treating the issues 
already framed as legal/preliminary issue or some new issue is required to 
be framed, the Court shall proceed accordingly and decide the application 
under section 12 (2) “CPC” within three months from the date of first 
appearance of the parties before the Court. The parties are directed to
