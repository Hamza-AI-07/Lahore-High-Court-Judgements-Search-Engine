The 
petitioner 
has 
invoked 
constitutional 
jurisdiction of this Court to challenge the show cause 
notice dated 05.06.2023 along with notice dated 
13.06.2023 issued by the Deputy Commissioner Inland 
Revenue, LTO, Lahore. 
2. 
In the impugned notice dated 05.06.2023 issued 
under Section 11(1) of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 (‘Act’), it 
has been alleged that the petitioner, being registered 
person, has violated the provisions of Sections 2(9), 3(1), 
6(2), 7(1), 26(1) of the Act read with Rule 18(9) of the 
Sales Tax Rules, 2006 (‘Rules’) and has been charged of 
non-payment of liability of Rs.404,416,691/- as also the  
non-filing of sales tax returns for the tax periods January, 
2023 and February, 2023 which in addition to recovery of 
sales tax due, exposes the petitioner to default under 
Section 34(1)(a) of the Act and penalty under Section 
33(5) of the Act. The other impugned notice dated 
13.06.2023 has been issued in response to petitioner’s 
letter dated 12.06.2023 wherein it has been clarified that 
the impugned show cause notice dated 05.06.2023 has 

2 
                                    W.P.No.42272 of 2023 
been issued under Section 11(1) of the Act on the basis of 
actual facts and figures pertaining to the tax period passed 
on 
self-admitted/declared 
daily 
production/dispatch 
reports submitted by the petitioner during imposition of 
Section 40B of the Act. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that 
being a registered person who failed to file returns for 
certain tax periods, case of the petitioner falls within the 
purview of sub-section (6) of section 11  and outside the 
scope of sub-section (1) of section 11 of the Act, therefore, 
the impugned show cause notice has been issued without 
lawful authority and the same is of no legal effect. He 
maintains that because of the non-obstante clause in sub-
section (6) of section 11 ibid, the liability, if any, of the 
petitioner can be determined exclusively under the said 
provision. He elaborates that the scope of sub-section (1) 
of section 11 of the Act, as manifest from the text thereof, 
is confined to those persons who are liable to be registered 
but not actually registered and the petitioner’s case, being 
that of duly registered person,  does not fall within the 
ambit of the same. He finally contends that liability of the 
petitioner was only to be determined under sub-section (6) 
of section 11 of the Act in accordance with Chapter-17 of 
the Rules.  
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent-
FBR, on watching brief, contends that liability under sub-
section (6) of section 11 of the Act is the minimum tax 
liability which the petitioner has to pay and that does not 
absolve him of assessment and payment of the tax liability 
otherwise under the Act.  In support of his contention, he 
has relied on sub-rule (5) of Rule 157. Learned Law 

3 
                                    W.P.No.42272 of 2023 
Officer has also opposed the petition while adopting the 
arguments of learned counsel for the revenue authorities.  
5. 
Heard.   
6. 
To properly appreciate respective contentions of 
learned counsel for the parties, it would be advantageous 
to reproduce the relevant provisions of Section 11 of the 
Act, which read as follows:- 
 
11.  
Assessment of Tax and recovery of tax not levied or short-
levied or erroneously refunded.—(1) Where a person who is 
required to file a tax return fails to file the return for a tax period by 
the due date or pays an amount which, for some miscalculation is 
less than the amount of tax actually payable, an officer of Inland 
Revenue shall, after a notice to show cause to such person, make an 
order for assessment of tax, including imposition of penalty and 
default surcharge in accordance with sections 33 and 34: 
 
 
Provided that where a person required to file a tax return 
files the return after the due date and pays the amount of tax payable 
in accordance with the tax return alongwith default surcharge and 
penalty, the notice to show cause and the order of assessment shall 
abate. 
(2)  
------ 
(3)  
------ 
(4)  
------ 
(4A)  
------ 
(5)  
------ 
(6)  
Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), 
where a registered person fails to file a return, an officer of Inland 
Revenue not below the rank of Assistant Commissioner, shall subject 
to such conditions as specified by the Federal Board of Revenue, 
determine the minimum tax liability of the registered person. 
(7)  
For the purpose of this section, the expression  
"relevant date" means-- 
 
 
(a) 
the time of payment of tax or charge as 
provided under section 6; and 
 
 
(b) 
in a case where tax or charge has been 
erroneously refunded, the date of its refund. 
 
7. 
It is manifest from the text of sub-section (1) of 
Section 11 of the Act that the same confers authority upon 
the officer of Inland Revenue to make an order for 
assessment of tax including imposition of penalty and 
default surcharge in accordance with Sections 33 and 34 
of the Act in two situations associated with a person who 
is required to file a tax return: firstly, where he fails to file 
return for tax period by due date or secondly, in case where 
he pays an amount which for miscalculation is less than 
amount of tax actually payable. It is a mandatory 
prerequisite specified in the aforementioned provision that 

4 
                                    W.P.No.42272 of 2023 
before passing an order for assessment of tax, the person 
in default is given a notice to show cause. Proviso to 
subsection (1) of Section 11 of the Act states that the show 
cause notice and order for assessment shall abate where a 
person required to file a tax return, files the return after the 
due date and pays the amount of tax payable in accordance 
with tax return alongwith default surcharge and penalty.  
8. 
Who is required under the Act to file a return is the 
crucial question here. In terms of section 14 of the Act read 
with Rule 4 of the Rules of 2006, every person engaged in 
the making of taxable supplies in Pakistan in the course or 
furtherance of any taxable activity carried on by him is 
required to be registered under the Act, falling in any of 
the categories mentioned in the said provision. The 
obligation to furnish returns in the prescribed form under 
section 26 of the Act is upon every registered person to 
indicate the purchases and supplies made during a tax 
period as well as the tax due and paid thereon alongwith 
such other information as has been prescribed.  
9. 
In the case of Commissioner Inland Revenue, 
Gujranwala v. S.K. Steel Casting, Gujranwala (2019 PTD 
1493), after elaborately analyzing the scope provisions 
including sections 2(25), 3, 6, 7, 8, 14, 23 & 26 of the Act 
and Rules 4, 5 & 6 of the Sales Tax Rules 2006, it has been 
held by a Division Bench of this Court that an unregistered 
person or a person liable to be registered cannot file its 
return as per provisions of the Act since no such 
mechanism/procedure has been provided in the Act for 
such a person to file its return. 
10. 
It is thus abundantly clear that provision of sub-
section (1) of section 11 can be invoked only against a 
person required to file a return under the Act i.e.  registered 
person and there is no weight in the submission of learned 

5 
                                    W.P.No.42272 of 2023 
counsel for the petitioner that the same visualizes 
proceedings against those who are liable to be registered 
but not registered. However, upon registration under the 
Act of a person, sub-section (1) of section 11 becomes 
invocable against even for such period of default during 
which the person was liable to be registered and furnish 
return  under the Act.            
11. 
Subsection (6) of section 11 of the Act provides for 
determination by an officer of Inland Revenue not below 
the rank of Assistant Commissioner of the minimum tax 
liability of the registered person who defaults in filing a 
tax return. Such determination is, however, subject to such 
conditions as specified by the Federal Board of Revenue. 
Rule 157 of the Sales Tax Rules, 2006 outlines the 
procedure to be followed for determining minimum 
liability in the following terms:-   
 
157.  
Procedure to be followed for determining minimum 
liability.—(1) Whether a registered person fails to file a return by 
the due date, an officer not below the rank of Assistant 
Commissioner, having jurisdiction, shall issue a notice to the 
registered person to file return within fifteen days failing which his 
minimum liability would be determined. 
 
(2) 
If the registered person files the return within the time as 
stipulated in the notice, the notice shall abate. If otherwise, the 
officer shall proceed to determine the minimum liability in the 
manner as prescribed in the following rule.  
 
(3)  The Assessment order determining the minimum liability 
shall be communicated to the registered person.  
 
(4)  If the registered person files the return and pays the due 
amount of sales tax for the tax period alongwith additional tax and 
penalty under section 33(1) of the Sales Tax Act, 1990, within one 
month of the determination made as above, the order of minimum 
tax liability will be considered to have been withdrawn. In case the 
registered person does not pay the amount of sales tax determined 
for the tax period, the tax liability determined will be recovered 
under section 48 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990. 
(5)  
The determination made in the aforesaid manner shall be 
the minimum liability, and the payment thereof shall not absolve the 
registered person of further liability which may accrue or be 
determined at a later stage through audit or otherwise on the basis 
of available record under the provisions of law.” 
 
 
12. 
There is no apparent inconsistency within the 
provisions of sub-section (1) and (6) of Section 11 of the 
Act inasmuch as those have been enacted for different 
purposes. While sub-section (1) of the Act confers 

6 
                                    W.P.No.42272 of 2023 
authority to determine final tax liability of a person who 
defaulted in filing a tax return for a tax period or paid an 
amount for some miscalculation less than the amount of 
tax actually payable, jurisdiction under sub-section (6) of 
Section 11 of the Act is confined to determination of 
minimum tax liability of such registered person in default.  
Rule 157 of the Sales Tax Rules, 2006 elaborately 
provides procedure to be followed for determining the 
minimum tax liability and sub-rule (5) of Rule 157 ibid 
categorically suggests that determination of minimum 
liability and payment thereof shall not absolve the 
registered person of further liability which may accrue or 
be determined on the basis of available record under the 
provision of law. 
13. 
In the absence of any apparent inconsistency or 
patent conflict within the provisions of sub-section (1) and 
(6) of Section 11 of the Act, plea of the petitioner qua non- 
obstante nature of clause (6) of section 11 is of little help 
to assail the impugned show cause notice under section 
11(1) of the Act. In the case of Muhammad Mohsin 
Ghuman and others v. Government of Punjab through 
Home Secretary, Lahore and other (2013 SCMR 85) the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan enunciated the law governing 
construction of non-obstante clauses in the following 
terms:-  
“It has to be read in the context of what the legislature conveys in the 
enacting part of the provision. It should first be ascertained what the 
enacting part of the section provides on a fair construction of words 
used according to their natural and ordinary meaning and the non 
obstante clause is to be understood as operating to set aside as no 
longer valid anything contained in relevant existing law which is 
inconsistent with the new enactment. The enacting part of a statute 
must, where it is clear, be taken to control the non obstante clause 
where both cannot be red harmoniously, for even apart from such 
clause a later law abrogates earlier laws clearly inconsistent with it. 
The proper way to construe a non obstante clause is first to 
ascertain the meaning of the enacting part on a fair construction of 
its words. The meaning of the enacting part which is so ascertained 
is then to be taken as overriding anything inconsistent to that 
meaning in the provisions mentioned in the non obstante clause. A 
non obstante clause is usually used in a provision to indicate that 
that provision should prevail despite anything to the contrary in the 

7 
                                    W.P.No.42272 of 2023 
provision mentioned in such non obstante clause. In case there is 
any inconsistency between the non obstante clause and another 
provision one of the objects of such a clause is to indicate that it is 
the non obstante clause which would prevail over the other clauses. 
It does not, however, necessarily mean that there must be 
repugnancy between the two provisions in all such cases. The 
principle underlying non obstante clause may be invoked only in 
the case of ‘irreconcilable conflict’.”

For the foregoing reasons, the instant petition, being 
devoid of any merit, is dismissed in limine.
