AALIA NEELUM, C.J: - The appellant-Irfan Haider, son 
of Tasleem Haider, Caste Syed, resident of Mouza Khaki Lakhi, Tehsil 
Shorkot, District Jhang, was involved in case F.I.R. No.603 of 2012, dated 
17.11.2012, registered under Sections 302, 324, 148, 149 P.P.C., at P.S. 
Shorkot City, District Jhang and was tried by the learned Additional 
Sessions Judge, Shorkot. The trial court seized with the matter in terms of 
the judgment dated 20.12.2018, convicted Irfan Haider (the appellant) under 
Section 302 (b) PPC, and sentenced to Death as Tazir for committing Qatl-
e-Amd of Ghulam Haider (the deceased), with the direction to pay 
compensation of Rs.2,00,000/- to the legal heirs of the deceased as 
envisaged under section 544-A of Cr.P.C and in case of default thereof, to 
undergo 06-months S.I further.  
2. 
 
 Feeling aggrieved by the trial court's judgment, Irfan Haider, 
the appellant, has assailed his conviction and sentence by filing the instant 
jail appeal bearing Criminal Appeal No.12708-J of 2019. The trial court also 
referred the M.R. No.399 of 2018 (The State. Vs. Irfan Haider) to confirm 

Murder Reference No.399 of 2018 & 
Crl. Appeal No.12708-J of 2019

the death sentence awarded to the appellant-Irfan Haider. Both the matters 
arising from the same judgment of the trial court are being disposed of 
through a single judgment. 
3. 
 
The prosecution story, as alleged in the F.I.R (Ex. PA/1) lodged 
on the written application (Ex. PA) of Zafar Abbas (PW-6)-the complainant, 
is that on 17.11.2012, at about 02:15 p.m., the complainant (PW-6) along 
with his brothers namely, Ghulam Haider (since dead) and Muhammad Jabir 
were busy in making arrangements of majlis at Darbar Syed Ahmad Ali 
Shah, situated at Mouza Tatthi Ailchi. In the meanwhile, the accused, Irfan 
Haider along with his co-accused persons, equipped with lethal weapons, 
while riding on four motorcycles came at the place of occurrence. After that, 
the accused persons, Dabeer Husain, Israr Hussain, Aftab Hussain, Ahmad 
Raza, Qaisar Abbas, Irfan Haider, and Tahir Abbas, pointed their respective 
weapons toward them while the remaining accused persons started to raise 
the construction of the house and four walls. The complainant and his 
brothers came there and restrained the accused persons from doing so. At 
about 03:00 p.m., when they insisted the accused persons to restrain from 
said work, then the accused persons asked their co-accused to murder the 
complainant party, whereupon, the accused, Ahmad Raza fired at Ghulam 
Haider (since dead), which hit him at his left thigh, the accused, Qaisar 
Abbas made a fire shot which landed on the left side of the abdomen of 
Ghulam Haider (since dead), and accused, Irfan Haider made a riffle burst, 
which hit on the chest of Ghulam Haider (since dead), who fell down and 
succumbed to the injuries. The accused, Tahir Abbas, made a fire shot, 
which hit Liaqat Ali (uncle of the complainant, injured PW) at the upper side 
of his left thigh. After the alleged occurrence, the accused persons fled away 
from the place of occurrence. The motive behind the occurrence was a land 
dispute where the accused persons started construction on the day of the 
alleged occurrence. Syed Karam Hussain donated the said land for 
“Janazgah.”  
4. 
 
 After the incident, the complainant reported the matter to the 
police through his written application (Ex. PA). After that, formal F.I.R. 

Murder Reference No.399 of 2018 & 
Crl. Appeal No.12708-J of 2019 
 
3
(Ex.PA/1) was chalked out by Muhammad Riaz, 745/Head Constable (PW-
1). After registering the case, the investigation was entrusted to Muhammad 
Riaz, Inspector (since dead), who found the accused/appellant guilty, 
prepared a report under Section 173, Cr.P.C., and sent the same to the court 
of competent jurisdiction. Muhammad Afzal, S.I appeared in the witness box 
as (PW-9) and identified the handwriting of Muhammad Riaz, Inspector 
(since dead)-the investigating officer. On 04.08.2017, the trial court formally 
charge-sheeted the appellant, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed 
trial. In support of its version, the prosecution produced as many as eleven 
(11) witnesses. Ishtiaq Rasul, the Inspector, appeared in the witness box as 
CW-1. 
5. 
 
The ocular account, in this case, has come out from the 
statements of Zafar Abbas (PW-6)-the complainant, Liaqat, injured PW 
(PW-7), and Muhammad Jabir (PW-8)-the eyewitness, whereas Dr. 
Muhammad Naeem (PW-2), who conducted the postmortem examination of 
Ghulam Haider (the deceased) found the following injuries on his person: 
INJURIES 
1. 
Six firearm entrance wounds, each measuring 
0.8 cm x 0.8 cm x DNP, on the front of the 
chest and upper abdomen.  
2-A. A firearm entrance wound 0.8 cm x 0.8 cm 
through & through on the right front side of 
the abdomen and 10 cm away from the 
umbilicus. 
2-B. A firearm exit wound 1.2 cm x 1 cm on the 
right flank, 2 cm above the right iliac crest. 
3-A. A firearm entrance 0.8 cm x 0.8 cm x through 
& through on the front of the left thigh at its 
middle. 
3-B. A firearm exit wound 1.2 cm x 1 cm on the 
back of the left thigh, 9 cm from the left knee 
joint. 
 
After conducting the postmortem examination, the 
doctor opined that death was caused by shock 

Murder Reference No.399 of 2018 & 
Crl. Appeal No.12708-J of 2019 
 
4
hemorrhage and injuries to vital organs (heart, lung, 
liver), which were sufficient to cause death in the 
ordinary course of nature (Injury No.1). Firearms caused 
all the injuries and were ante-mortem. The probable time 
between injuries and death was within minutes, whereas 
between death and postmortem, it was within 15 hours. 
Dr. Safdar Abbas appeared in the witness box as PW-4 and stated that he 
was familiar with the handwriting and signatures of Dr. Qaisar Abbas (since 
dead), who medically examined Liaqat Ali, injured PW. He also stated that a 
Medicolegal Certificate was issued by Dr. Qaisar Abbas (since dead) dated 
17.11.2012.   
6. 
 
The learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor gave up PWs 
Rustam, Ishtiaq Rasul, Hamid Hussain, and Ahmad Sher, S.I being 
unnecessary, Lal Khan & Zawar Hussain 482/C being dead, and closed the 
prosecution evidence after tendering reports of Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency (Ex. PMM and Ex. PLL). Learned counsel for the complainant also 
tendered certified copies of private complaint (Ex. PFF), statements of 
Ahmad Sher, S.I, Hamid Hussain, DSP, Ishtiaq Rasul, Inspector, and 
Gulfam Hussain (Ex. PGG, Ex. PHH, Ex. PJJ and Ex. PKK). 
7. 
 
 The appellant was also examined in terms of Section 342 
Cr.P.C., wherein he refused to appear as his own witness in terms of Section 
340(2) Cr.P.C.; however, he opted to produce evidence in his defence. In 
response to a particular question about why this case was against him and 
why the PWs deposed against him, the appellant made the following 
deposition: - 
“I have close relations with Dabeer Hussain 
Shah (nephew) who has ex-enmity with 
complainant 
party 
due 
to 
this 
reason 
complainant got registered this case against me. 
Complainant and PWs falsely involved me in 
this case.”  

Murder Reference No.399 of 2018 & 
Crl. Appeal No.12708-J of 2019 
 
5
In documentary evidence, the accused tendered certain documents, i.e., Ex. 
DA to Exh. DO.     
 
8. 
 
After evaluating the evidence available on record and 
considering arguments advanced by both sides, the trial court found the 
prosecution version proved beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt, which 
resulted in the appellant’s conviction and sentence in the above terms.  
9. 
 
We have carefully considered both sides’ rival submissions and 
minutely reviewed the evidence on record.  
10. 
 
In the instant case, the occurrence took place on 17.11.2012 at 
03:00 p.m. Zafar Abbas (PW-6)-the complainant and brother of Ghulam 
Haider (the deceased), informed the police about the occurrence at 04:15 
p.m. through written application (Ex. PA) at Lakhi Pull Tehsil Shorkot 
District Jhang to Muhammad Riaz Inspector (since dead), who sent the 
written complaint (Ex. PA) through Muhammad Akram 772/C (not cited as 
PW) for lodging of criminal case. Based on the written complaint (Ex. PA), 
Muhammad Riaz 745/H.C (PW-1) chalked out FIR (Ex.PA/1) at 04:45 p.m. 
The distance between the place of occurrence and the police station is 16 
kilometers. Zafar Abbas (PW-6)-the complainant deposed during 
examination-in-chief that: - 
“Through mobile phone, I informed the 
occurrence to the police. After that, I proceeded 
to Shorkot for filing application to the police for 
registration of case. At Lakhi Pul, I met Mehr 
Riaz Inspector to whom I submitted the 
application Exh.PA, on the basis of which the 
FIR was registered. After it, the police reached 
the place occurrence, seized the dead body and 
also took into possession the blood stained 
earth.” 
 
 
Liaqat (PW-7)-injured PW and paternal uncle of the 
complainant, deposed during examination-in-chief that:- 
“I fell down and became unconscious. After 
that, the police reached the place of occurrence 
and I was taken to the THQ Hospital, Shorkot 

Murder Reference No.399 of 2018 & 
Crl. Appeal No.12708-J of 2019 
 
6
where the doctor examined me and issued 
medical certificate. 
Muhammad Jabir (PW-8)-eye witness and brother of the complainant, 
deposed during examination-in-chief that: - 
“My brother Zafar Abbas went to Shorkot City 
for reporting the occurrence to the police. The 
police 
reached 
the 
place 
of 
occurrence, 
examined the dead body and shifted the dead 
body and injured person to the THQ Hospital, 
Shorkot. 
 
 
As per the prosecution case, the incident took place at 03:00 
p.m., and soon after the incident, Zafar Abbas (PW-6)-the complainant, 
proceeded to the police station to report the incident to police and Zafar 
Abbas (PW-6)-the complainant met with Muhammad Riaz Inspector (since 
dead) at Lakhi Pull. Zafar Abbas (PW-6)-the complainant handed over a 
written complaint (Ex. PA) at 04:15 p.m. to Muhammad Riaz, Inspector 
(since dead). The inordinate delay of one hour and 15 minutes in reporting 
the incident has not been explained by the prosecution, even though the 
matter was not reported to police in the police station, and the same was 
reported at Lakhi Pull. Delay in lodging the FIR often results in 
embellishment, a creature of an afterthought. This view is further 
strengthened by the testimony of Liaqat (PW-7)-the injured witness, paternal 
uncle of the complainant, and deceased. He (PW-7) deposed that after the 
incident, police reached the place of occurrence. It means that till the arrival 
of police Liaqat (PW-7)-the injured witness was not shifted to the hospital 
for medical treatment, although he received firearm injuries; this means that 
the injured remained lying injured at the place of occurrence for one hour 
and 15 minutes, and no one bothered to shift the injured to the hospital for 
medical treatment, which proves that the witnesses were not present at the 
spot. The content of the injury statement (Ex. PF/2) reveals that after 
registration of FIR (Ex. PA/1), Liaqat (PW-7)-the injured PW, was taken to 
the THQ hospital, Shorkot, through Najam Abbas 1893/C (not cited as PW) 
for medical treatment. The scanned copy of the injury statement (Ex. PF/2) 
is reproduced hereinunder: - 

Murder Reference No.399 of 2018 & 
Crl. Appeal No.12708-J of 2019

Dr. Safdar Abbas (PW-4) appeared and tendered secondary evidence as Dr. 
Qaisar Abbas, who medically examined Liaqat Ali (PW-7), had died. Dr. 
Safdar Abbas (PW-4) deposed that on 17.11.2012, the injured PW was 
brought by Najam Abbas 1893/C (not cited as PW). From the MLC (Ex. PF) 
of Liaqat Ali (PW-7)-the injured witness also, it is evident that in the column 
of the name of relative and friend, the name of relative(s) is not mentioned, 
but the name of Najam Abbas 1893/C (not cited as PW) is mentioned. In the 
said MLC (Ex. PF), the timing of arrival and examination has also not been 
mentioned. In the column of No. and date of police docket/court order FIR 
No.603 of 2012 was mentioned, which means till the registration of FIR (Ex. 
PA/1) Liaqat (PW-7)-the injured witness was not shifted to the hospital for 
medical treatment while from the contents of the FIR (Ex. PA/1), it also 
reveals that injured was not shifted to the hospital before registration of the 

Murder Reference No.399 of 2018 & 
Crl. Appeal No.12708-J of 2019 
 
8
FIR (Ex. PA/1). In the FIR (Ex. PA/1), the complainant mentioned that the 
injured was in the struggle for life and death. Dr. Safdar Abbas (PW-4) 
admitted during the cross-examination that: - 
 
“It is correct that Exh.PG/1 is attested carbon 
copy of original copy. -------- It is correct that 
original copy of final report is not available on 
the record. ----------I have not mentioned in my 
report Exh.PG/1 that there was no possibility of 
fabrication. 
Confronted 
with 
the 
earlier 
statement recorded on 16.11.2016 in the court 
of Judge Ghulam Mujtaba Baloch, ASJ Shorkot 
where 
the 
possibility 
of 
fabrication 
is 
mentioned.” 
 
 
The conduct of the prosecution witnesses cannot be said to be 
natural. Even the evidence of the eyewitnesses must stand the test of 
probability. If their conduct is unnatural, doubt is created about the 
prosecution case, and their oral evidence is not believable. Muhammad 
Imran (PW-11), who identified the dead body of the deceased, deposed 
during cross-examination that: - 
“My house is situated at a distance of four 
squares from the place of occurrence. I came to 
know about the occurrence at 03:00 pm on 
hearing firing. At about 04:00 pm, the dead 
body of Ghulam Haider was shifted to the THQ 
Hospital, Shorkot. ---------- The Investigating 
Officer was also present there. The complainant 
Zafar Abbas was also there. At the time of 
reaching the dead body of Ghulam Haider 
(deceased) the doctor was already present there. 
The police recorded my statement under 
Section 161 Cr.P.C at the police station on the 
next morning.” 
 
 
In column No.3 of the inquest report (Ex. PD), the investigating 
officer mentioned the date and time of receiving information of the death as 
“17.11.2012 at about 03:00 p.m.”. In column No.4, the names of witnesses 
who identified the dead body are written as “Laal Khan and Muhammad 
Imran.” Whereas, on the last page of the inquest report (Ex. PD), the place 
and time where the inquest report (Ex. PD) was prepared has been left blank. 
The names of the witnesses were mentioned as Nazim Hussain and 

Murder Reference No.399 of 2018 & 
Crl. Appeal No.12708-J of 2019

Makhdoom Ali Shah. Zafar Abbas (PW-6)-the complainant deposed during 
examination-in-chief that: - 
“On 16.11.2012 I got recorded my statement 
before the court of Rana Abdul Ghaffar, 
learned Judicial Magistrate, Shorkot. I do not 
remember whether Makhdum Ali was also got 
recorded 
his 
statement 
before 
the 
said 
Magistrate. I do not remember that Makhdum 
Ali Shah was co-accused in that case and also 
got recorded his statement. I do not remember 
whether I got recorded that I have no concern 
with the land situated in square No. 15, killa No. 
14/2 consisting of one Kanal in Thatti Ailchi 
Tehsil Shorkot, District Jhang. I do not 
remember whether I requested apology from 
Dabeer Shah. I do not remember whether I got 
recorded that we shall not tease Dabeer Shah in 
future. Makhdum Ali Shah was not present at 
the time of occurrence at the place of 
occurrence. 
I 
do 
not 
remember 
where 
Makhdum Ali Shah was present at that time. I 
do not remember that I connected him through 
telephone at that time to inform him that 
accused persons occupied his land.” 
 
 
It does not appeal to reason that a person who deposed that his 
memory is not weak would not remember such apparent details relating to 
the presence of Makhdum Ali Shah at the place and time of occurrence, who 
was his co-accused in the case registered against them. The name of 
Makhdoom Ali Shah is mentioned on the last page of the inquest report (Ex. 
PD), which suggests that Makhdum Ali Shah was present at the place of the 
occurrence when the inquest report was prepared. The inquest report (Ex. 
PD) is not signed by Zafar Abbas (PW-6), the complainant, and Muhammad 
Jabir (PW-8), the eyewitness, although they stated that they reached the 
place of occurrence in their presence. If investigating officer Muhammad 
Riaz Inspector (since dead) visited and prepared the inquest report (Ex. PD) 
and had met with Zafar Abbas (PW-6), the complainant, and Muhammad 
Jabir (PW-8), the eyewitness, there is no reason why the details that I have 
found missing from the inquest report (Ex. PD) should not have been there. 
The absence of those details indicates that the prosecution story was still in 

Murder Reference No.399 of 2018 & 
Crl. Appeal No.12708-J of 2019 
 
10
the embryo and had not been given any shape and that the FIR was recorded 
later after due deliberations and consultations. The second external check, 
equally important, is the sending of a copy of the FIR along with the dead 
body for postmortem examination and its reference in the inquest report (Ex. 
PD). The absence of these details in the inquest reports may indicate that the 
FIR was not registered and was recorded later after due deliberations and 
consultation. The relevant portion of the inquest report (Ex. PD) is 
reproduced hereinunder: -  
”جس پ ر بس ذرہعی ااغتسہث دقمہم ونعان بسال درج ررٹسج رکاب ا 
 بس ر ردیسیگ ومعق شعن الغم دیحر

Dr. Muhammad Naeem (PW-2) deposed during examination-in-chief that: -  
“I also prepared the sketches of injuries which 
are Ex.P.B/1 & Ex.P.B/2. I put my signature on 
injury statement EXP-C. I also put my 
signature on the inquest report EXP-D.” 
I have to scrutinize whether there has been a real delay in lodging the FIR or 
whether that creates a dent in the prosecution version. The complaint and 
FIR have been exhibited as Ex.PA and Ex.PA/1. It reveals that the 
prosecution witnesses, Zafar Abbas (PW-6), the complainant, and 
Muhammad Jabir (PW-8), were not present at the time when the inquest on 
the dead body was prepared. It also gets support from the fact that Zafar 
Abbas (PW-6)-the complainant deposed during examination-in-chief that: - 
 
“On 17.11.2012, at about 02:15 pm, I alongwith 
my brothers Ghulam Haider, Muhammad Jabir 
and my uncle Liaqat were busy in arranging 
“Majlis” at Darbar Baba Syed Ahmad Ali 
Shah.” 
 
 
Zafar Abbas (PW-6)-the complainant has made dishonest 
improvements in his statement before the court, and the defense confronted 
the statement made by the complainant (PW-6). Zafar Abbas (PW-6)-the 
complainant deposed during cross-examination as under: - 

Murder Reference No.399 of 2018 & 
Crl. Appeal No.12708-J of 2019 
 
11
“I got recorded in FIR that I along-with 
Ghulam Haider, Muhammad Jabir and Liaqat 
were busy arranging Majlis at Darbar Ahmad 
Ali Shah. Confronted with FIR (Exh.P.A/1) 
wherein it is so recorded. I do not remember 
whether I got mentioned in the FIR that my 
uncle Liaqat was present at a distance of 1½ 
from the place of occurrence. -------------I had 
got recorded my cursory statement in private 
complaint on 21.12.2013. I do not remember 
whether I got recorded in that statement that 
my uncle Liaqat was at a distance of 1 ½ acre 
when the occurrence took place.” 
Liaqat (PW-7)-the injured PW deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“At the time of first fire, I was present at the 
place of occurrence. Confronted with Exh: D.A 
wherein it is mentioned that I was present at a 
distance of 1 ½ acre from the place of 
occurrence.” 
Muhammad Jabir (PW-8)-the eye witness deposed during cross-examination 
that: - 
“I do not remember whether in my previous 
cursory 
statement 
recorded 
in 
private 
complaint that my uncle Liaqat was present at 
distance of 1 ½ acre from the place of 
occurrence at the time of occurrence. The police 
recorded my statement. I do not remember 
whether I got recorded in my statement u/s 161 
Cr.P.C. Liaqat PW was present at distance of 1 
½ acre from the place of occurrence.”  
Contrary to the above, Zafar Abbas (PW-6)-the complainant deposed during 
cross-examination that: - 
“My uncle Liaqat came at the spot at 10:00 am. 
PW volunteers he came there before. The 
witness Jabir was already was present at the 
place of occurrence when I reached there.” 
Liaqat (PW-7)-injured PW deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“I reached the Darbar at 08:00/09:00 am and 
others also reached at the same time.” 
Muhammad Jabir (PW-8)-the eyewitness deposed during cross-examination 
that: - 

Murder Reference No.399 of 2018 & 
Crl. Appeal No.12708-J of 2019 
 
12
“I along-with Liaqat, Zafar Abbas and Ghulam 
Haider reached at the spot on the same time. I 
do not remember at what time I reached the 
place of occurrence. I do not remember in my 
earlier statement that I reached the place of 
occurrence at about 02:15 pm.” 
 
 
The above depositions of the prosecution witnesses reveal that 
they are not stating the complete truth, and there is a conflict between the 
statements of the prosecution witnesses. However, Zafar Abbas (PW-6)-the 
complainant, and Muhammad Jabir (PW-8)-the eyewitness in their 
statements, could not answer most of the questions, and these witnesses 
answered the questions by saying, “'I do not remember.” 
 
 
This creates doubt about the presence of Zafar Abbas (PW-6)-
the complainant; Liaqat (PW-7)-the injured PW; and Muhammad Jabir (PW-
8)-the eye witness at the place of occurrence where Ghulam Haider deceased 
was done to death, as it was the prosecution case that Liaqat (PW-7) was 
present at a distance of 1½ acre from the place of occurrence at the time of 
occurrence.  
11. 
 
On the complaint (Ex. PA), FIR (Ex.PA/1) was chalked out by 
Muhammad Riaz 745/H.C. at 04:45 p.m. The written complaint (Ex. PA) 
reveals that the same was submitted by Zafar Abbas (PW-6)-the 
complainant. During cross-examination, he (PW-6) deposed that: - 
“I do not remember the name of scribe of FIR. I 
do not remember whether I got recorded in my 
previous cross-examination I got drafted 
application for registration policemen outside 
the police station.” 
 
 
Zafar Abbas (PW-6)-the complainant deliberately concealed the 
fact from the court while replying to the question he does not remember. 
However, he (PW-6) deposed during cross-examination, saying, “My 
memory is not weak.” If his memory is not weak, he should answer each 
question. The delay in lodging the report, where the incident was reported, 
and whether the complainant drafted the complaint or someone else raises 
considerable doubt regarding the veracity of the evidence of the prosecution 

Murder Reference No.399 of 2018 & 
Crl. Appeal No.12708-J of 2019 
 
13
witnesses and points toward the infirmity of evidence. It renders it unsafe to 
base convictions on it.  
12. 
 
It has been further noticed that Dr. Muhammad Naeem (PW-2) 
conducted a postmortem examination on the dead body of the deceased on 
18.11.2012. However, Dr. Muhammad Naeem (PW-2) has not deposed the 
time when he conducted the postmortem examination on the dead body of 
Ghulam Haider (the deceased). On perusal of the postmortem report (Ex. 
PB), it reveals that the dead body was received in the dead house on 
18.11.2012 at 02:00 a.m., complete documents and police papers were 
received at 02:00 a.m., and an autopsy was conducted at 02:15 a.m. on 
18.11.2012. It reveals that the postmortem was conducted with a delay of ten 
hours from the time of reporting the incident to the police. Muhammad 
Imran (PW-11), who identified the dead body of the deceased, deposed 
during cross-examination that, at about 04:00 p.m., the dead body of Ghulam 
Haider was shifted to the THQ Hospital, Shorkot. If the dead body was 
moved to the hospital for postmortem examination at 04:00 p.m., then there 
is a delay of 10 hours and 15 minutes in conducting postmortem 
examination. However, Mehar Riaz, Inspector (since dead), received the 
written complaint (Ex. PA) at 04:15 p.m. on 17.11.2012. The prosecution 
witnesses did not explain the delay in conducting the postmortem 
examination. The fact, however, remains that the postmortem was delayed 
for ten hours and 15 minutes from the time of reporting the incident. If we 
took time, as Dr. Muhammad Naeem (PW-2) deposed, that the time elapsed 
between death and postmortem was 15 hours, then the time becomes 
between 11:15 a.m. on 17.11.2012 and 02:15 a.m. on 18.11.2012. Thus, this 
proves that the death occurred sometime after 11:15 a.m. on 17.11.2012 
onward. These circumstances, to our mind, suggest that the FIR was ante-
timed. Dr. Muhammad Naeem (PW-2) deposed during cross-examination 
that: - 
“As soon as the dead body was received by me I 
proceeded with the autopsy without any loss of 
time on my part after reading the police 
papers.---------As soon as dead body was handed 
over to me for post mortem examination after 

Murder Reference No.399 of 2018 & 
Crl. Appeal No.12708-J of 2019 
 
14
completion of record I conducted post mortem 
examination.” 
 
 
The delay in conducting the postmortem examination also leads 
to the conclusion that the FIR was recorded with the delay, and the FIR was 
not recorded when claimed to have been recorded. Considering all these 
facts, we have no hesitation in concluding that the prosecution has not been 
able to prove on the record that the incident was reported when it was 
claimed to have been recorded. The conclusion is inescapable: The 
prosecution has been unable to establish the case against the appellant 
beyond reasonable doubt, and no circumstances connect him with the 
alleged crime.

As per the ocular account, Ghulam Haider (the deceased) died 
on 17.11.2012 at 03:00 p.m. whereas, as per the postmortem report (Ex. PB), 
the deceased died within 15 hours from the time of postmortem examination. 
Therefore, there is an apparent conflict between ocular account and medical 
evidence in such a situation. It also suggests that the occurrence did not take 
place as stated by the prosecution witnesses. The doctor also observed that 
rigor mortis was present on the dead body of Ghulam Haider. As per the 
prosecution case, the appellant was armed with 44 bore rifle at the time of 
occurrence, four metallic foreign bodies were removed from dead body 
during autopsy, same were handed over by doctor to police but not got 
compared from rifle statedly recovered from the appellant to confirm the 
nature of firearm weapon used for causing injuries and said omission goes 
against the prosecution under article 129(g) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 
1984. In the inquest report (Ex.PD), in column No.12, the investigating 
officer (since dead) mentioned that the cause of injuries was the result of 
torture as well as a firearm; similarly, four incisions each measuring 2.5 x 1 
cm on the body of deceased were noted by doctor in the postmortem 
examination report (Ex.PB), which have not been explained in ocular 
account by the prosecution. This also negates the presence of the prosecution 
witnesses at the place of occurrence at the time of occurrence.

 The report of Forensic Science Laboratory, Punjab, Lahore 
(Ex. PLL) is only to the effect that the weapon allegedly recovered from the 
accused/appellant-Irfan Haider, was in mechanical operating condition. So, 
the recovery of the weapon from the accused, Irfan Haider, is of no 
consequence. Accordingly, the appellant deserves to be given the benefit of 
the doubt, and findings in this regard are to be set aside, and the same are set 
aside.

As it is difficult to rely upon the testimonies of Zafar Abbas 
(PW-6)-the complainant, Liaqat (PW-7)-injured PW and Muhammad Jabir 
(PW-8), the eyewitness, and for other reasons enumerated hereinbefore, we 
are persuaded to hold that the prosecution had not been able to prove its case 
against the appellant beyond any shadow of doubt as there were many dents 
in the prosecution story. The conviction and sentence the learned trial court 
recorded cannot be sustained. It is held in the case of “Muhammad Akram 
v. The State” (2009 SCMR 230) that: - 
“The nutshell of the whole discussion is that the 
prosecution case is not free from doubt. It is an 
axiomatic principle of law that in case of doubt, 
the benefit thereof must accrue in favour of the 
accused as matter of right and not of grace. It 
was observed by this Court in the case of Tariq 
Pervez v. The State 1995 SCMR 1345 that for 
giving the benefit of doubt, it was not necessary 
that there should be many circumstances 
creating doubts. If there is circumstance which 
created reasonable doubt in a prudent mind 
about the guilt of the accused, then the accused 
would be entitled to the benefit of doubt not as a 
matter of grace and concession but as a matter 
of right.”

 Considering the above discussion, we affirm that the 
prosecution has failed to prove its case against the appellant beyond any 
shadow of a doubt. Therefore, I accept the instant Criminal Appeal 
No.12708-J of 2019 filed by Irfan Haider-appellant, set aside his conviction 
and sentence recorded by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Shorkot 
vide judgment dated 20.12.2018 and acquit him of the charge in case of

directed to be released forthwith if not required in any criminal case.

trial court for confirmation of the sentence of death inflicted upon the 
convict fails, which is answered in Negative and death sentence is not 
confirmed.
