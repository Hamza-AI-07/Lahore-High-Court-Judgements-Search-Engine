JUDGMENT 
 
Date of hearing: 
18.11.2024 
Petitioners by: 
Malik Javed Akhtar Wains and 
Syeda Azra Shah, Advocates.  
 
Respondents by: 
Malik Zafar Mehboob Langrial, 
Advocate for respondents No.3, 4a 
to 4d and 5 to 7.  
 
 
 
ASIM HAFEEZ, J. Decisions, subject matter are at variance. 
Trial court decreed petitioner’s suit for declaration, directed against the 
gift mutation No. 423 dated 29.04.1974 (‘impugned mutation’). 
Appellate Court, substantially, reversed finding of the trial court on 
issue No.1 relating to the limitation, allowed respondent’s appeal and 
dismissed petitioner’s suit. At the outset, it is pertinent to mention that 
petitioners alleged fraud against impugned mutation, which allegation 
was covered under issue No.7, which reads as, 
“Whether the Tamleek mutation No. 423 dated 29.04.1974 is based 
upon fraud and forgery and is against the law and facts, void and 
ineffective upon the rights of the plaintiff? OPP 
2.  
Trial Court recorded affirmative finding on issue No.7, 
which decreed the suit and declared impugned mutation void and 

Civil Revision No. 954-D/2012

ineffective – limitation was also decided in favour of the suitor. 
Interestingly, the Appellate court affirmed the finding of the trial 
court on issue No.7, which finding is neither questioned separately 
thorough any petition nor request for filing of cross-objection(s) 
against particular finding on issue No.7 was made. Paragraph 8 of 
the decision of the Appellate Court are reproduced hereunder, 
“8. Learned trial court has decided Issue No.7 in favour of the 
respondents/plaintiffs. Findings of learned trial court on Issue 
No.7 deciding the same in favour of the respondents/plaintiffs 
and against the appellants/plaintiffs are correct. Learned trial 
court has rightly held that presence of Hassan Bukhsh at the 
time of attestation of mutation was mandatory. The order of 
attestation of mutation No.423 dated 24.04.1974 does not find 
mention the presence of Hassan Bukhsh and any other witness 
as per requirement of section 42 of Land Revenue Act. 
Learned trial court has also rightly held that it was incumbent 
upon the appellants/defendants to prove the factum of gift by 
producing oral as well as documentary evidence. The 
appellants/defendants have neither produced all the witnesses 
of gift nor the Patwari who recorded Rozenamcha Waqiati 
dated 23.04.1974 Ex.P-19 regarding the Tamleek by Hassan 
Bukhsh in favour of his legal heirs. Findings on this issue, 
therefore, need not to interfere.” 
 
3.  
Contesting respondent - beneficiary of the decision of the 
Appellate Court – submitted application for permission to allow 
production of additional evidence, which comprised of the revenue 
record to show that predecessor of the petitioners had been paying 
revenue dues / levies. Arguments heard qua the merits of the 
application for additional evidence, and I am not persuaded to allow 
the application for two reasons; firstly, so peculiar circumstances are 
pleaded or explained that why said document / record was not 
produced during the trial of the case or even before the appellate 
court. And secondly, brining of document on record, if first hurdle is 
crossed, would not extend any help to the contesting respondents

especially when fraud qua impugned mutation was established – 
beneficiary thereof had failed to prove gift transaction, ingredients 
thereof and recording of the transaction – concurrently recorded 
findings on issue No.7 need no review, when it was not questioned. 
In these circumstances, no illegality or prejudice would be caused 
upon dismissing the application.  
4.  
In view of the facts of the case, question that requires 
determination is, whether defence of limitation of suit holds ground 
when factum of fraud qua impugned mutation was unequivocally 
established / proved, and which findings were not controverted or 
even questioned. 
5.  
Learned counsel for the petitioner attacked decision of the 
appellate court on the issue of limitation, whose contention is that 
once fraud is established, question of limitation stood settled 
collaterally. Adds that when fraud is proved no defence of limitation 
was available. Following decisions are cited, reported as, “Khan 
Muhammad through L.Rs and  others vs. Mst. Khatoon Bibi and others”. (2017 SCMR 
1476), Mehmood Khan and others vs. Sara Akhtar (2024 SCMR 178), “Peer Baksh 
through LRs and others vs. Mst. Khanzadi and others” (2016 SCMR 1417), “Khalida 
Idrees and others vs. Anas Farooq Chaudhary and others” (PLD 2018 Lahore 819), “Mst. 
Tahira Samina and others vs. Javed Saeed Tariq and others” (2024 SCMR 24),“Faqir Ali 
and others vs. Sakina Bibi and others” (PLD 2022 Supreme Court 85), “Shabla and 
others vs. Mst. Jahan Afroz Khilat and others” (2020 SCMR 352), “Mahmood Shah vs. 
Syed Khalid Hussain Shah and others” (2015 SCMR 869) and “Abdul Rahim and another 
vs. Mrs. Jannatay Bibi and 13 others” (2000 SCMR 346).  
6.  
Learned counsel for contesting respondents could not 
disagree that adverse finding on issue No.7 recorded against 

Civil Revision No. 954-D/2012

respondents by Appellate Court were not assailed. Learned counsel 
focused on the evidence of PW-1 and emphasized that said witness 
admitted factum of possession 24-Kanal of land, who acknowledged 
that petitioner’s predecessor Naseer Ahmad – [son of the donor] - 
had cultivated land measuring 24-Kanal and never demanded his 
share in excess of 24-Kanal, which transfer was an effect of 
impugned mutation. Respondents questioned maintainability of the 
suit on the ground of limitation, who defended gift on the premise 
that predecessor of the petitioners, Naseer Ahmad, did not question 
legality of impugned mutation during his life. Following decisions 
are cited in support of submissions, reported as “Saadat Khan and others vs. 
Shahid-ur-Rehman and others” (PLD 2023 Supreme Court 362), “Nasir Ali vs. 
Muhammad Asghar” (2022 SCMR 1054), “Mst. Faheeman Begum (deceased) through 
L.Rs and others vs. Islam-ud-Din (deceased) through L.Rs and others” (2023 SCMR 1402) 
and KABIR MUHAMMAD (DECEASED) through L.Rs v. ALLAH BAKSH (DECEASED) 
through L.Rs and others’ (2020 CLC Note 12).

8.  
Petitioners had questioned legitimacy of alleged gift, 
recorded vide impugned mutation, alleging fraud. Contesting 
respondents, being the beneficiaries, are obligated to prove the 
factum of oral gift and recording thereof, by way of execution of 
mutation. Proving fraud in this case is like showing light to the sun, 
when findings on issue No.7 affirmed it and same attained finality. 
Hence, principal fact stood established. Other relevant issues are that 
despite claim of gift the land remained unpartitioned and no effort 
was made by the beneficiaries of gift to effect partition – petitioners 
filed suit upon demise of Naseer Ahmad - 22 days after the demise. 

Civil Revision No. 954-D/2012

Evidence of PW-1 is misconstrued, who stated that Naseer Ahmad 
cultivated land measuring 24-Kanal, which cannot be construed as 
an implied admission of having knowledge of alleged gift mutation. 
Testimony of DW-1 had established state of disillusioned Naseer 
Ahmad, who acknowledged that Naseer Ahmad was not involved 
with cultivation of the land, who came later on to cultivate. This 
statement collaterally established that alleged gift was not witnessed 
by Naseer Ahmad, and no direct evidence was produced that Naseer 
Ahmad was part of the process of alleged gift by donor to his sons – 
otherwise an unequal distribution of land in terms of holdings, which 
fortifies doubts qua legality of alleged oral gift. It was established 
that family lived jointly, even after death of Naseer Ahmad. All these 
evidentiary facts confirmed doubts qua the legality of gift transaction.  
9.  
Objection of limitation hold no ground upon failure of the 
beneficiaries to prove alleged transaction of gift and execution of the 
mutation – both had to be proved independently. See the case of 
“Peer Baksh through LRs and others Vs. Mst. Khanzadi and others” 
(2016 SCMR 1417).  
10. 
Fraud vitiates even the most solemn transaction, attracting 
voidness in respect thereof. Even otherwise once impugned mutation 
is proved to be a consequence of defrauding the donor and depriving 
heirs of the donor of their due share, issue of limitation becomes 
insignificant and all heirs of the donor, upon his death, will become 
co-owners and upon death of Naseer Ahmad, his heirs are entitled to 
claim share of the deceased. See the case of FAQIR ALI and others v. 

Civil Revision No. 954-D/2012

SAKINA BIBI and others (PLD 2022 Supreme Court 85). Relevant 
portion thereof is reproduced hereunder:- 
We note that the gift mutations were attested in the year 
1985 onwards and the suit for their cancellation was filed in 
2004. It is on this basis that it has been argued that the suit 
was barred by time. In view of the fact that Respondents No. 1 
and 2 had challenged the gift mutations on the ground of fraud 
and collusion, we do not find any force in the contention of 
learned Advocate Supreme Court for the Appellants that the 
suit was barred by time. It is settled law that where fraud and 
collusion are alleged and established, the question of 
limitation does not and cannot help the beneficiary of such 
fraud and collusion.” 
Judgments cited respectively are examined and found to be 
distinguishing, in the context of facts involved therein and those, 
which are discussed here. Appellate court erred in law in dismissing 
the suit on the ground of limitation, especially when it had 
acknowledged and affirmed the finding on issue No.7, reiterating 
failure of the beneficiaries of the gift to prove it.  
11. 
In view of aforesaid, this Civil Revision is allowed and 
findings of appellate court on issue No.1 is reversed, all the findings 
of the trial court are hereby affirmed, which judgment of the trial 
court of 12.06.2010 is upheld and decision of the appellate court of 
allowing appeal and dismissing of suit is set-aside. Consequently, 
suit is decreed accordingly. No order as to the costs.
