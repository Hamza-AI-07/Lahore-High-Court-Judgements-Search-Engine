& others 
 
J U D G M E N T 
Date of hearing:     27.07.2023.                                                     
Petitioner by: 
M/s. Hassan Iqbal Warraich and Arslan 
Abbas Buttar, Advocates.                             
Respondents by: 
M/s. Salman Mansoor, Muhammad Nadeem

Mr. Muhammad Zain Qazi, Assistant 
Attorney General along with Ziarukh Jan, 
Deputy Director (Legal).  
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.:- This 
writ petition is directed against order dated 12.04.2023, passed by 
respondent No.2 / General Manager (Coordination) Power, WAPDA 
House, Lahore, whereby letter of acceptance for tender No.36-
MAT(2022)/TPS opened on 11.01.2023 belonging to Chief Engineer 
(Power) Tarbela Power Station, was cancelled.  
2. 
Learned counsel for petitioner submits that petitioner-company 
submitted its bid of Rs.240 Million for the disposal of tender of 
transformer 79-MVA with accessories. He adds that the said amount 
was transferred / encashed in favour of respondents and consequently, 
letter of acceptance of bid dated 31.01.2023 was issued in favour of 
petitioner. He adds that petitioner-company and its directors have sold 
valuable properties in order to win the aforesaid tender and now, 
respondent-authority has knocked out the petitioner-company in an 
unlawful manner, which is against the fundamental rights of petitioner. 
He argues that impugned cancellation of tender is in violation of 
General Conditions of Tender for Disposal of Unwanted Store. He 

 
2 
Writ Petition No.25808 of 2023 
 
maintains that material aspects of the matter have been overlooked 
while passing impugned order, hence, same is unsustainable in the eye 
of law. In support, he has relied upon National Saving Central 
Directorate, Islamabad through D.G. and another v. Muhammad 
Farooq Raja (2021 CLD 370).      
3. 
Contrarily, learned counsel for respondents defends the 
impugned order by contending that keeping in view the financial 
situation in the country and non-availability of copper in the market, 
the transformers are required to be utilized for Hydel Power Stations 
and distribution companies, therefore, decision of cancellation of bid 
was taken due to extreme difficult situation. He contends that even 
otherwise, contract of sale cannot be enforced by recourse to 
constitutional jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution of the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (“the Constitution”). In support, 
he has referred to Messrs Momin Motor Company v. The Regional 
Transport Authority, DACCA and others (PLD 1962 Supreme Court 
108), State Life Insurance Corporation of Pakistan v. Messrs Pakistan 
Tobacco Company Ltd. (PLD 1983 Supreme Court 280), Messrs 
Airport Support Services v. The Airport Manager, Quaid-e-Azam 
International Airport, Karachi and others (1998 SCMR 2268), Messrs 
Ittehad Cargo Service and 2 others v. Messrs Syed Tasneem Hussain 
Naqvi and others (PLD 2001 Supreme Court 116), Messrs Ramna

Weight mentioned as above was approximate, only for the 
assessment of bid price. Since, the tender is floated on “AS IS 
WHERE IS BASIS”, you have already been instructed to inspect 
and satisfy regarding the type, quantity and condition of the store. 
Failure to inspect the disposable goods will not be advanced as a 
plea in any claim.  
Kindly arrange to deposit with Habib Bank Limited WAPDA House 
Branch Lahore, Account No.05527900561501 either in cash or by 
CDR / Bank Draft drawn in favour of the Director General 
(Purchase & Disposal) WAPDA for Rs.284,880,000/- (Rupees 
Two Hundred Eighty Four Million Eight Hundred & Eighty 
Thousand Only) (including all taxes) within 21 working days after 
the issue of this letter (Last Date being 01.03.2023) failing which 
the Earnest Money for this tender will be forfeited without any further 
notice and no claim shall lie or be raised against this decision.  
On payment of the full amount a Release Order will be issued in 
your favour by this office on the basis of receipt of Bank Deposit slip 
to be furnished by you and confirmation from bank regarding receipt 
of the amount for which your tender bid has been accepted.  
You will be held responsible for any loss due to incomplete / 
incorrect or change in postal address as given by you.  
6. 
As per terms of General Conditions of Tender for Disposal of 
Unwanted Store, an invitation of a tender would not constitute any 
liability on the part of the Authority until a Letter of Acceptance was 
issued. It is nowhere provided that after acceptance of bid, tender could 
have been cancelled / withdrawn. Respondents have not cited any 
provision of applicable law or placed any document on record to show 
that such prerogative was vested with them. Under the celebrated 
principle of locus poenitentiae, a right was accrued in petitioner’s 
favour, thus, the same could not have been taken away unilaterally by 
respondents without associating the petitioner. The reasons for 
withdrawal of letter of acceptance provided in the impugned order are 
extraneous to bid documents and not plausible as well. Reliance is 
placed upon Muhammad Farooq Raja’s case supra, Mian Atta Ullah v. 
Lahore Development Authority Tribunal and 5 others (1996 CLC 
1943) and Messrs Lucky Cement Limited v. The Central Board of 
Revenue and others (PLD 2001 Peshawar 7).  
In the case of Muhammad Farooq Raja supra, the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court has observed as under:- 

 
5 
Writ Petition No.25808 of 2023 
 
“6. 
We have noticed that the petitioner was under 
incumbent duty to scrutinize the status of the respondent 
prior to issuing acceptance which has accrued a right in 
favour of respondent, any slackness at the part of the 
petitioner at belated stage cannot be burdened to the 
respondent and the same is hit by principle of locus 
poenitentiae. In a similar case reported as (PLD 1992 SC 
207) "The Engineer-in-Chief Branch through Ministry of 
Defence, Rawalpindi and another v. Jalaluddin" this court 
while adjudicating the matter has held which is reproduced 
as under:- 
"However, as the respondent had received the 
amount on the bona fide belief, the appellant is not 
entitled to recover the amount drawn by the 
respondent during this period when the letter 
remained in the field.... We consider that as far as 
the recovery of amount in question is concerned, 
the principle of locus poenitentiae would be 
applicable and the appellants are not entitled to 
recover the amount. The appellants have 
themselves taken a liberal view and the recovery of 
only 12 months is being made" 
Otherwise the case of the respondent is also covered by 
section 24-A of General Clauses Act, 1897, which clearly 
reflect that once a right is accrued, the same cannot be 
withdrawn unless and until it is established that the 
scheme 
was 
obtained 
by 
practicing 
fraud 
or 
misrepresentation. Section 24-A of the General Clauses 
Act, 1897, is reproduced as under:- 
"24-A. Exercise of power under enactments.- 
(1) Where, by or under any enactment, a power to 
make any order or give any direction is conferred 
on any authority, office or person such power shall 
be exercised reasonably, fairly, justly and for the 
advancement of the purposes of the enactment. 
(2) The authority, office or person making any 
order or issuing any direction under the powers 
conferred by or under any enactment shall, so for 
as necessary or appropriate give reasons for 
making the order or, as the case made be for 
issuing the direction and shall provide a copy of 
the order or as the case may be, the direction to 
the person affected prejudicially.” 
 
7. 
Law on the subject is very clear that where Government 
controlled functionaries made a promise which created a right to 
anyone who believed in it and acted under the same, then such 
functionaries were precluded from acting detrimental to the rights of 

 
6 
Writ Petition No.25808 of 2023 
 
such person/citizen. In the case reported as Pakistan through Ministry 
of Finance Economic Affairs and another v. FECTO Belarus Tractors 
Limited (PLD 2002 Supreme Court 208), the Hon’ble Supreme Court 
while discussing the concept of doctrine of promissory estoppel, has 
ruled as under:- 
“23. 
It will be necessary to Coach the true concept of the 
doctrine of promissory estoppel. Before proceeding further 
this doctrine has been variously called 'promissory estoppel' 
'requisite estoppel', 'quasi estoppel' and 'new estoppel'. It is 
a principle evolved by equity to avoid injustice and though 
commonly named 'promissory estoppel'. It is neither in the 
realm of contract nor in the realm of estoppel. The true 
principle of promissory estoppel seems to be that where one 
party has by his words or conduct made to the other a clear 
and unequivocal promise which is intended to create legal 
relations or effect a legal relationship to arise in the future, 
knowing or intending that it would be acted upon by the other 
party to whom the promise is made and it is in fact so acted 
upon by the other party, the promise would be binding on the 
party making it and he would not be entitled to go back upon 
it, if it would be inequitable to allow him to do so having 
regard to the dealings which have taken place between the 
parties and this would be so irrespective of whether there is 
any pre-existing relationship between the parties or not. The 
doctrine of promissory estoppel need not be inhibited by the 
same limitation as estoppel in the strict sense of the term. It 
is an equitable principle evolved by the Courts for doing 
justice and there is no reason why it should be given only a 
limited application by way of defence. There is no reason in 
logic or principle why promissory estoppel should also not be 
available as a cause of action.” 
 
8. 
Even otherwise, there is no force in the contention of learned 
counsel for respondent-WAPDA that there was no concluded contract 
between the parties. It is a common ground between them that the offer 
made by respondent-WAPDA through the tender was accepted by the 
petitioner. It is also evident on the face of the record that in 
implementation of the contract, petitioner even deposited CDR dated 
09.01.2023 amounting to Rs.24,000,000/-. Even otherwise, once an 
offer has been accepted, a concluded contract has come into being and 
it is not open in the person who has accepted the offer to retract from 
the same as provided by the Contract Act, 1872. Reliance is placed 

 
7 
Writ Petition No.25808 of 2023 
 
upon Messrs O.K. Agencies v. Chief Controller and others (2000 YLR 
1867).  
9. 
It is well settled law with the mandate of the dictums of the 
superior courts of the country that inaction, slackness and dubious acts 
of executive functionaries cannot be accorded approval by the superior 
courts more particularly when suchlike actions on face of it are besides 
the law, mandate of the constitution and principle of natural justice. 
The other defect from which the impugned order suffers is that the 
petitioner was not granted any opportunity of showing cause or of 
hearing before passing the impugned order, which is against the global 
principle of natural justice i.e. “Audi Alteram Parterm”. Reference is 
made to Pakistan State Oil Company Ltd. through General Attorney v. 
National Highway Authority through Chairman and another (PLD 
2012 Islamabad 50).  
10. 
So far as the objection regarding maintainability of instant 
petition for enforcement of concluded contract is concerned, 
admittedly the High Court in exercise of its Constitutional jurisdiction 
is possessed of power to examine the validity of the order in regard to 
grant of a concluded contract and strike it down on the grounds of 
mala fide, arbitrary exercise of discretionary power, lack of 
transparency, discrimination and unfairness etc. provided the challenge 
is made promptly and contentious questions of fact are not involved. It 
has consistently been held that while routine contractual disputes 
between private parties and public functionaries are not open to 
scrutiny under the Constitutional jurisdiction, breaches of such 
contracts, which do not entail inquiry into or examination of minute or 
controversial questions of fact can adequately be addressed. In this 
case, no factual dispute exists between the parties with regard to 
floating of tender, acceptance of offer and partial payment by 
petitioner. Needless to say that remedy of Constitutional petition would 
be permitted to be resorted to in cases involving contract between 
private persons and State statutory functionary for such remedy was 
considered to be more efficacious and speedy remedy as compared to 

 
8 
Writ Petition No.25808 of 2023 
 
civil suit or arbitration proceedings. Reliance can be placed upon 
Messrs Airport Support Services v. The Airport Manager, Quaid-e-
Azam International Airport, Karachi and others (1998 SCMR 2268), 
Messrs Ittehad Cargo Service and 2 others v. Messrs Syed Tasneem 
Hussain Naqvi and others (PLD 2001 Supreme Court 116) and 
Messrs SIEYUAN-NEIE-NAEEM & Company v. The Federation of 
Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Water and Power and others 
(2022 CLC 516).  
 
The case law cited by learned counsel for respondent-WAPDA 
in this regard, having distinguishable facts and circumstances, is not 
attracted to this case.  
11. 
The stance of respondents that transformers in question are 
required to cope with acute shortage of copper has no strong footing 
to cancel the acceptance letter as respondents themselves are 
offering tenders for disposal of other transformers, which is evident 
from documents attached with C.M. No.3 of 2023 at its pages 4, 5  
& 6.  
12. 
For the reasons recorded above, instant petition is allowed and 
impugned order is declared to be illegal and without lawful authority. 
Respondents are directed to proceed in the matter of tender in question 
as per applicable law / rules / procedure and finalize the same at the 
earliest.
