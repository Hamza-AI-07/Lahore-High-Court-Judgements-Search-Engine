ABID AZIZ SHEIKH, J. This Constitutional Petition is 
directed against the order dated 04.10.2023 (impugned order) 
passed by respondent No.3 under Section 38(1) and 40 of the 
Sales Tax Act, 1990 (Act), whereby respondent No.4 alongwith 
his team was duly authorized to make inspection and take into 
custody the record/documents belonging to petitioner-company. 
The petitioner has also challenged the search warrant order 
dated 04.10.2023 (impugned search warrant) issued under 
Section 40 of the Act. 
2. 
Relevant facts are that the petitioner is Manufacturer/ 
Importer/Exporter of various sanitary and hygienic products. 
Due to alleged concealment of sales, respondent No.4 
alongwith his staff/team was authorized, through the impugned 
order, to inspect the record belonging to the petitioner-company 
and take into custody such record. Respondent No.4 was also 
authorized to obtain search warrant under Section 40 of the Act. 

[2] 
Writ Petition No.75402/2023  
 
 
 
 
Consequently, the impugned search warrant was got issued by 
the concerned Magistrate and respondent No.4 conducted raid 
and seized various documents mentioned in Resumption Memo 
appended as Annexure-B (Resumption Memo). The petitioner 
being aggrieved has filed this Constitutional Petition. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that under 
Section 38 of the Act, only routine visit can be carried out to 
inspect the record and documents, whereas record can only be 
searched and seized under Section 40 of the Act, if any 
proceedings under the Act are pending and the record is 
relevant or useful to said proceedings. He submits that as no 
proceedings are pending against the petitioner, the record/ 
documents mentioned in Resumption Memo could not be 
searched and seized under Section 40 of the Act by respondent 
No.4. 
4. 
Learned counsel for respondent-department, on the other 
hand, submits that during desk audit analysis it has been 
observed that the petitioner is engaged in concealment of sales 
for amount of more than Rs.340 Million since its registration 
and consequently evaded sales tax thereon, resultantly, the 
impugned order as well as the impugned search warrant was 
issued and the documents were taken into custody in presence 
of the staff of petitioner as per Resumption Memo, which was 
also duly stamped and signed by the said staff. She submits that 

[3] 
Writ Petition No.75402/2023  
 
 
 
 
in view of the desk audit analysis, the impugned order, search 
warrant and the raid are justified. 
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. The legal question 
require determination in this case is that whether respondent 
No.4 could conduct raid and seize the documents/record of the 
petitioner, as per Resumption Memo, under Sections 38 & 40 of 
the Act. For ready reference, the provisions of Sections 38 & 40 
of the Act are reproduced hereunder: 
“38. Authorized officers to have access to 
premises, stocks, accounts and records –(1) Any 
officer authorized in this behalf by the Board or the 
Commissioner shall have free access including 
real-time 
electronic 
access 
to 
business 
or 
manufacturing premises, registered office or any 
other place where any stocks, business records or 
documents required under this Act are kept or 
maintained belonging to any registered person or a 
person liable for registration or whose business 
activities are covered under this Act or who may be 
required for any inquiry or investigation in any tax 
fraud committed by him or his agent or any other 
person; and such officer may, at any time, inspect 
the goods, stocks, records, data, documents, 
correspondence, accounts and statements, utility 
bills, bank statements, information regarding 
nature and sources of funds or assets with which 
his business is financed, and any other records or 
documents, including those which are required 
under any of the Federal, Provincial or local laws 
maintained in any form or mode and may take into 
his custody such records, statements, diskettes, 
documents or any part thereof, in original or 
copies thereof in such form as the authorized 
officer may deem fit against a signed receipt.  
(2) 
The registered person, his agent or any other 
person specified in sub-section (1) shall be bound 
to answer any question or furnish such information 
or explanation as may be asked by the authorized 
officer. 

[4] 
Writ Petition No.75402/2023  
 
 
 
 
(3) 
The department of direct and indirect taxes 
or any other Government department, local bodies, 
autonomous bodies, corporations or such other 
institutions shall supply requisite information and 
render necessary assistance to the authorized 
officer in the course of inquiry or investigation 
under this section. 
(4) 
For the purpose of sub-section (1), the Board 
may make rules relating to electronic real-time 
access for audit or a survey of persons liable to 
tax.” 
 
“40. Searches under warrant.– (1) Where any 
officer of Inland Revenue has reason to believe that 
any documents or things which in his opinion, may 
be useful for, or relevant to, any proceedings under 
this Act are kept in any place, he may after 
obtaining a warrant from the magistrate, enter that 
place and cause a search to be made at any time.  
(2) 
The search made in his presence under sub-
section (1) shall be carried out in accordance with 
the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure, 1898 (V of 1898).” 
Emphasis supplied 
 
Plain reading of Section 38(1) of the Act shows that any officer, 
authorized by the Commissioner Inland Revenue, shall have 
free excess to the business or manufacturing premises, 
registered office or any other place where any stock, business 
record or documents required under this Act are kept or 
maintained belonging to the registered person or a person liable 
for registration or whose business activities are covered under 
this Act or who may be required for any inquiry or investigation 
in any tax fraud. Under section 38 of the Act, an officer 
authorized may inspect and also take into custody the record 
mentioned therein, as he may deem fit, against a signed receipt. 

[5] 
Writ Petition No.75402/2023  
 
 
 
 
Whereas under Section 40 of the Act, where any officer of 
Inland Revenue has reason to believe that any document or 
things which in his opinion, may be useful for, or relevant to 
any proceedings under this Act are kept in any place, he may, 
after obtaining warrant from Magistrate, enter that place or 
cause a search to be made at any time. 
6. 
In this case, admittedly the impugned order and the 
search warrant in-question are issued in pursuance of the desk 
audit analysis highlighting concealment of sales but there are no 
proceedings pending under the Act for which the documents 
may be useful or relevant, which is a precondition under 
Section 40 of the Act for issuance of search warrant. The 
Supreme Court in “Collector of Sales Tax and Central Excise 
(Enforcement) and another Vs. Messrs Mega Tech (Pvt.) Ltd.” 
(2005 PTD 1933) held that as per the language employed in 
Sections 40 & 40A of the Act, the requirement of law appears 
to be that where an officer of sales tax has reason to believe that 
any document or things, which in his opinion may be relevant 
to any proceedings under the Act, are concealed or kept in any 
place and there is a danger of removal of such documents or 
records, he may, after obtaining warrant from Magistrate, enter 
that place and cause a search to be made at any time and the 
search authorized shall be carried out strictly in accordance 
with relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 

[6] 
Writ Petition No.75402/2023  
 
 
 
 
1898 (Cr.PC). However, in the present case, neither any 
proceedings are pending nor any specific document or thing has 
been mentioned in the impugned order or impugned search 
warrant, which is concealed or kept in any place and is in 
danger of removal. This Court, in “Pakistan Chipboard (Pvt.) 
Ltd. through Chief Executive Officer Vs. Federation of Pakistan 
etc.” (2015 PTD 1520), also held that when there are no 
proceedings pending under the Act, the provision of Section 40 
of the Act for search cannot be invoked. The desk audit analysis 
can at best be treated as inquiry or investigation but does not 
amount to proceedings under the Act, therefore, the provision 
of Section 40 of the Act could not be invoked in the impugned 
order or search warrant, therefore, to that extent the impugned 
order & search warrant are not sustainable. 
7. 
Now the next moot question is that whether documents, 
mentioned in the Resumption Memo, could be inspected and 
taken into custody under Section 38(1) of the Act. As already 
discussed above, there is no precondition in Section 38 of the 
Act that proceedings be pending for inspection or taken into 
custody the record, however, the Division Bench of this Court 
in “GHULAM HUSSAIN Vs. FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN 
through Ministry of Finance, Islamabad and 5 others” (2021 
PTD 1379) held that purpose of visit, in terms of Section 38 of 
the Act, is to see whether proper record under the Act, relevant 

[7] 
Writ Petition No.75402/2023  
 
 
 
 
Rules and Regulations is maintained or not, and the authorized 
officer in this regard must produce the copy of authorization 
before commencing the inspection and visit must be confined to 
inspect the record and documents that are in plain sight or 
voluntarily made available for inspection by the person(s) 
present at the premises on request, and consequently only such 
record can be taken into custody within the meaning of Section 
38 of the Act. The Division Bench further held that the officer 
has no power, under Section 38 of the Act, to compel 
production of any record or document that is not in plain sight 
or that has not been voluntarily made available as above.  
8. 
The same view was also expressed by the Sindh High 
Court in “Messrs Apple Paper Products (Pvt.) Ltd. Through 
Director Chief Executive Officer Versus Federation of Pakistan 
through Chairman and 2 others” (2019 PTD 787) in following 
terms: 
“The visit must be confined to inspecting the 
record and documents that are in plain sight or 
those that are voluntarily made available for 
inspection by the person(s) present at the premises 
on request. Consequently, custody within the 
meaning of Section 38 can only be taken of such 
record and documents that are in plain sight or 
those that have voluntarily been made available for 
inspection on request. The record and documents 
taken into custody must be against a receipt signed 
by the officer. The officer has no power under 
section 38 to compel the production of any record 
or document that is not in plain sight or that has 
not been voluntarily made available as above. Any 
record or document taken into custody under 
compulsion cannot be used for any purpose 

[8] 
Writ Petition No.75402/2023  
 
 
 
 
whatsoever by the department against the person 
from whose custody the record or document has 
been taken by an officer into his possession. 
Whereas, under section 40 of the Act, if the officer 
of respondent department, has “reason to believe” 
that it will be useful for or relevant to any 
proceedings then he may obtain search warrant 
from Magistrate and carry out search of “any 
place”. Such search shall be carried out in 
accordance with Criminal Procedure Code, 1898. 
What is necessary for the search under section 40 
is that “a proceeding” under the Act is pending. 
Whereas, there is no such requirement of Notice 
under Section 38 of the Act, before proceeding 
under Section 40 of the Act.  
 
In another case titled “Agha Steel Industries Ltd. through 
Authorized Company Secretary and another Versus Directorate 
of Intelligence and Investigation through Director and 2 
others” (2019 PTD 2119), the Sindh High Court held as under:- 
“22. 
Therefore, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
above 
pronouncements of the Hon’ble Supreme Court as 
well as this Court and the learned Lahore High 
Court, it could be safely held that the department 
under the garb of a Notice under Section 38 of the 
1990 Act, cannot conduct a search or a raid of the 
premises as for that purposes, the only recourse 
available is an action under Section 40 of the Act 
(ibid). What has happened in this case, is in fact a 
search or a raid of the premises under the garb of 
Section 38, which only permits to have access to 
the record and nothing beyond that. Since I have 
come to the conclusion that the very validity of the 
act and action initiated under Section 38 is not 
proper and lawful.  
 
The same view was also laid down by this Court as well as the 
Sindh High Court in “Messrs Iqbal and Sons through 
Authorized Representative Versus Federation of Pakistan 
through Secretary and 3 others” (2017 PTD 590), “Messrs 

[9] 
Writ Petition No.75402/2023  
 
 
 
 
Stylo Shoes through Managing Partner and another Versus 
Deputy Director and others” (2013 PTD 1780), “Z & J 
Hygienic Products (Pvt.) Ltd. Versus Collector Sales Tax” 
[(2011) 103 TAX 281 (H.C. Lah.)], “A.M.Z. Spinning & 
Weaving Mills (Pvt.) Ltd. through Manager Finance Versus 
Federation 
of 
Pakistan 
through 
Secretary, 
Revenue 
Division/Ex-Officio Chairman, C.B.R., Islamabad and 2 others” 
(2009 PTD 1083), “Messrs Food Consults (Pvt.) Ltd., Lahore 
and others Versus Collector (Central Excise & Sales Tax), 
Lahore and 2 others” (2004 PTD 1731) and “Messrs Ihsan 
Yousaf Textile Mills (Pvt.) Ltd., Faisalabad Versus Federation 
of Pakistan through Ministry of Finance, Islamabad and 4 
others” (2003 PTD 2037). The Division Bench of this Court in 
“Director Intelligence & Investigation versus M/s BIOCOS 
International & 5 others” (PLJ 2020 Lahore 1) upheld the 
decision of Single Bench of this Court whereby the department 
was directed to return the data collected under Section 38 of the 
Act after retaining duplicate copies of the same. 
9. 
In view of above discussion, indeed the respondents 
could neither invoke the provisions of Section 40 of the Act nor 
they could compel production of any record or documents that 
were not in plain sight or had not been voluntarily made 
available, however, perusal of the copy of Resumption Memo 
(appended with reply), shows that same has been duly stamped 

[10] 
Writ Petition No.75402/2023  
 
 
 
 
by the petitioner, as required under Section 38(1) of the Act. 
Though the petitioner in this petition has challenged the 
impugned order and impugned search warrant claiming that the 
respondent No.4 alongwith officials and policemen entered its 
business premises and took away the record but it is nowhere 
specifically pleaded that said record was not in plain sight or 
was forcibly taken into custody by respondents. On the other 
hand, the respondents in their reply though defended the 
impugned order and search warrant on legal plane yet nowhere 
stated that the record was made available voluntarily for 
inspection and taken into custody on request. This being a 
factual dispute cannot be decided in this Constitutional Petition, 
therefore, by following the principle, settled by the Division 
Bench of this Court in case of “M/s BIOCOS International” 
supra, the respondents are directed to return the data and record 
as per Resumption Memo to the petitioner after retaining the 
duplicate copies thereof.  
10. 
For what has been discussed above, this Writ Petition is 
partially allowed in above terms.
