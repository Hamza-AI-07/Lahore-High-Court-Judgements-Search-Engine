MUZAMIL AKHTAR SHABIR, J: Through this Intra Court 
Appeal filed under Section 3 of the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972, 
the appellant has called in question order dated 02.02.2023 passed by 
learned Single Judge of this Court, whereby constitutional petition 
bearing W.P.No. 70467/2022 filed by the appellant, with the 
following prayer, was dismissed.  
“It is therefore, most respectfully prayed that this writ petition 
may kindly be accepted and directions be issued to respondents 
No. 2 while entertaining the application of the petitioner on 
behalf of his real daughter namely Prastish Akhiz in the light of 
minority quota while its notification No. PA/AS(LM)/MISC/ 
2020 dated 18.05.2020, and name of petitioner’s daughter may 
kindly be added in the minority quota after conducting 
MDCAT. 
It is further prayed that the respondent No. 1 to 4 may also be 
directed to act upon the above said notification in its true letter 
and spirit to meet the ends of justice. 
It is further prayed that during the pendency of this writ 
petition while restraining the respondent No. 4 for not to 
prepare merit list of all the students without making a separate 
merit list for minorities on 2% quota seats.”

2.  
It is contended by the appellant that the Government of the 
Punjab, Higher Education Department vide Notification No. PA/AS 
(LM)/MISC/2020 dated 18th May 2020,  has reserved 2% quota seats 
in Public Sector Higher Education Institutes for religious minorities 
under the Punjab Minorities Empowerment Package and the 
appellant’s daughter seeks admission  in MBBS programme on the 
basis of said quota reserved for minorities, which has been declined 
by the respondents without any legal justification and the learned 
Single Judge has also not given due consideration to the grievance of 
the appellant while dismissing the constitutional petition filed by the 
appellant. 
3.  
On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent-UHS 
states that the afore-referred quota was reserved for employment in 
the Higher Education Department and not in seats reserved for 
admission of students in educational institutions, therefore, the stance 
of the appellant is not justified and the learned Single Judge of this 
Court rightly dismissed the constitutional petition filed by the 
appellant. 
4.  
Heard. Record perused. 
5.  
The appellant through his constitutional petition sought 
direction to entertain application of his daughter for considering her in 
minority quota in MBBS admission by placing reliance on the 
Notification dated 18th May 2020, issued by the Government of the 
Punjab, Higher Education Department; the operative part of which is 
reproduced below:- 
“The Government of the Punjab has been pleased to approve the 
reservation of 2% seats in Public Sector Higher Education 
Institutes for religious minorities under the Punjab Minorities 
Empowerment Package along with direction to ensure separate 
merit list for minority candidates, under Rules 28 (15) & 30 to 
the Punjab Government Rule of Business, 2011.” 
 
6.  
It is observed that the afore-referred Notification applies to 
recruitment to various posts and not for admission in MBBS 

I.C.A.No. 10837 of 2023  
Dated 28.02.2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                         
 
3
programme/classes, which is a very competitive process and quota of 
minorities for the said programme has not been yet reserved. The 
reservation of posts by 2% quota in various departments for religious 
minorities cannot be extended to admission in educational institutions 
on the basis of said quota as both cater to different aspects, wherein 
merit is maintained for admission of students to educational 
institutions whereas the quota is reserved in service in different 
departments for minorities for appointment to ensure that they get 
sufficient representation in service, therefore, the learned Single Judge 
was justified to dismiss the constitutional petition filed by the 
appellant by observing as under:- 
“2.  
The above Notification approves the reserving of 2% 
seats in Public Sector Higher Education Institution for religious 
minorities under the Punjab Minorities Empowerment Package 
and it also obliges the department to ensure separate merit list 
for minority candidates. Suffice to say that this Notification by its 
terms does not apply to the case of the petitioner and is 
applicable on recruitments being made to the Public Sector 
Higher Education Institution. On the other hand, the petitioner’s 
daughter has completed her pre-medical F.Sc. Examination, 
2021 from Lahore Board having studied in Kinnaird College, 
Lahore. She seeks admission in the MBBS Program on the basis 
of minority quota. Suffice to say that there is no such quota 
reserved for minorities for admission to medical universities and 
colleges in MBBS and BDS programs. This has also been 
affirmed by the University of Health Sciences Lahore in its letter 
dated 8.12.2022. The petitioner’s daughter should compete on 
the Punjab merit list having studied in one of the best institutions 
in Pakistan for women. No direction can be issued by this Court 
in this regard and this petition is dismissed.” 
 
7. 
The policy decision of the Government through afore-noted 
notification dated 18th May 2020 reserving 2% quota in Public Sector 
High Education Institutes for religious minorities under the Punjab 
Empowerment Package has been made applicable to candidates who 
apply to join government service and not for candidates who seek 
admission to educational institutions as students. This fact has been 
also affirmed by the Counsel for the respondent-UHS. Nothing has 
been placed on the record to show that the afore-referred notification 

I.C.A.No. 10837 of 2023  
Dated 28.02.2023

was extended to admissions of students in educational institutions 
especially MBBS and BDS students. This court cannot extend the 
policy decision of the government taken in service matter in 
Educational institutions to be applicable to admissions of students to 
said educational institutions or other such institutions as this Court 
cannot take the role of policy maker and substitute policy framed by 
the competent authority by policy of its own. Reliance may be placed 
on 2012 PLC (CS) 917 = 2011 SCMR 1864 (Executive District 
Officer (Revenue), District Khushab at Jauharabad and others versus 
Ijaz Hussain and another), wherein it is provided that framing of 
policy and rules thereunder fell in the executive domain and Court 
could neither assume role of policy maker nor that of a law maker. In 
the said case the direction of High Court to amend the recruitment 
policy providing for 40% marks for interview with observation that 
marks for interview should not exceed 25% of the total marks was set 
aside by the Supreme Court and it was observed that Recruitment 
policy framed by the Provincial Government was part of delegated 
legislation and its provisions could not be struck down on vague 
consideration of being ‘unreasonable’ or likely to be misused and only 
the particular act of mala fide could be challenged and struck down.  
Similar view has been taken in judgments reported as 2006 PSC 1284 
(Syed Muhammad Arif and others versus University of Balochistan 
and others), PLD 1975 SC 667 (Government of Pakistan through 
Secretary, Ministry of Commerce and another versus Zamir Ahmad 
Khan), 1978 SCMR 327 (Zamir Ahmad Khan versus Government of 
Pakistan and another) wherein it is mentioned that Court has only 
jurisdiction to interpret the law that Court had no jurisdiction to take 
the role of policy maker in the garb of interpretation. 
8. 
Besides it is settled by now that where a thing is required to be 
done in a particular manner, it must be done in the said manner and 
not otherwise as the same would be against the intention of legislature 
and not sustainable. Reliance in this behalf may be placed on 2022 

I.C.A.No. 10837 of 2023  
Dated 28.02.2023

SCMR 2080 (Mall Development (Pvt.) Ltd. versus Waleed Khanzada 
and others), wherein it is mentioned that when the law provides a 
particular manner of doing things, they must be done in that manner 
or not at all. Anything done to the contrary would be illegal, ex-facie 
erroneous and unsustainable in law. Same principle has been laid 
down in judgments reported as 2021 SCMR 1979 (Attaullah Khan 
versus Ali Azam Afridi and others), PLD 2018 SC 189 (Muhammad 
Hanif Abbasi versus Imran Khan Niazi), 2017 SCMR 1427 (The 
Collector of Sales Tax, Gujranwala versus Super Asia Mohammad 
Din and Sons), 2016 CLD 2025 (SC) = PLD 2016 SC 995 (Shahida 
Bibi and others versus Habib Bank Limited and others), PLD 2013 
SC 255 (Muhammad Anwar and others versus Mst. Ilyas Begum and 
others), 2014 SCMR 1015 (Zia Ur Rehman versus Syed Ahmed 
Hussain and others), PLD 2011 SC 512 (Khalil-ur-Rehman and 
another versus Dr. Manzoor Ahmed and others) and 2007 SCMR 
1086 (Muhammad Akram versus Mst. Zainab Bibi). 
9.  
In view of the afore-referred position as no separate quota is 
reserved for admission of students belonging to religious minorities 
and the aforementioned notification is not applicable to the case of 
appellant for admission to M.B.B.S. and BDS program and the Court 
ordinarily has no jurisdiction to extend policy decision made for a 
particular purpose to any other purpose to which the same is not 
applicable, hence, on the basis of the principles laid down in the afore-
referred judgments, this Court restrains itself from extending the 
notification dated 18th May, 2020 reserving 2% quota seats for 
employment in public sector Higher Education Institutes for religious 
minorities under the Punjab Minorities Empowerment Package to 
admissions of students to said institutes as for admission the said 
students cannot be treated differently from other students and have to 
compete on merit unless a policy is framed by the government to cater 
to quotas for minorities for admission of students in educational 
institutes.

10.  
There is another aspect of the matter, which needs to be 
addressed. The appellant has filed the titled constitution petition and 
the Intra Court Appeal in his own name for seeking admission of his 
daughter to the MBBS program on 2% quota for religious minorities 
without disclosing that in which capacity he is representing her. The 
petition and the appeal should have been filed in the name of 
appellant’s daughter for she was the candidate who was seeking 
admission and if she had attained the age of majority, the appellant 
could have represented her as her attorney or her counsel as he is an 
advocate of this Court. In case she was still a minor, then the petition 
and appeal could have been filed in her name with the appellant being 
father as her next friend, however, both the said courses of action have 
not been adopted, rather the appellant has filed the constitutional 
petition and the Intra Court appeal in his own name whereas he 
himself is not seeking admission to the MBBS program and is not an 
aggrieved party in strict sense to be authorized to invoke jurisdiction 
of this Court. Moreover, the vires of the notification/policy or law 
have also not been called in question for which the appellant could 
claim to have locus standi to file the constitutional petition and 
appeal. Even the prayer of the constitutional petition already 
reproduced above shows that the appellant seeks direction to the 
respondents to entertain his application on behalf of his daughter, 
which shows that the appellant’s daughter has not filed any 
application with the respondents for redress of grievance. The entire 
proceedings have been initiated by the appellant without any apparent 
authority to represent his daughter in the said proceedings whereas no 
law authorized any person to represent another without the knowledge 
or against the wishes of the other, for which reference may be placed 
on 2007 CLC 483 (Karachi) (Syed Imtiaz H. Rizvi versus Abdul 
Wahab and another), hence, this appeal is not maintainable on the 
account of having been filed by an unauthorized person, lacking locus 
standi.

11.  
In view of what has been discussed above, the impugned order, 
whereby constitutional petition filed by the appellant has been 
dismissed, is well-reasoned and does not suffer from any illegality or 
jurisdictional defect for this Court to interfere in the same.  
12.  
For what has been discussed above, this Intra Court Appeal 
being devoid of any force is dismissed.
