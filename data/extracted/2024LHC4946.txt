07.11.2024 Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, ASC for the 
Petitioner alongwith Mr. Jahanzeb Sukhera, 
Barrister Mehak Zafar, Kashish Haider and 
Batool Hussain, Advocates. 
Mr. Osman Khan, Assistant Advocate General 
(on Court call). 
Mr. Muhammad Abid, Civil Judge/Research 
Officer. 
 
 
 
The Petitioner has filed this Writ of 
Mandamus under Article 199(1)(a)(i) of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
(the “Constitution”), to direct the Respondents to 
do, what they are required by law to do and in 
this case, to implement provisions of Section 15 
of the Punjab Environmental Protection Act, 
1997 
(the 
“Act”) 
read with the Punjab 
Environmental 
Protection 
(Motor 
Vehicles) 
Rules, 2013 (the “2013 Rules”).  
2. 
Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, ASC 
submits that the Petitioner is a child of three years 
and she has filed this petition through her mother 
for the protection of intergenerational rights of 
the future generation to a clean and healthy 
environment as enshrined in (newly inserted) 
Article 9A to the Constitution under Section 16 of 
the Constitution (Twenty-sixth Amendment) Act, 

2 
W.P.No.69910/2024 
2024 (the “Twenty-sixth Amendment”), which 
are being irreversibly affected through the 
adverse impacts of air pollution currently 
prevailing in Lahore city. 
3. 
When confronted how writ is maintainable 
after insertion of new clause (1A) to Article 199 
of the Constitution under Section 16 of the 
Twenty-sixth Amendment, because it confines 
the jurisdiction of this Court by mentioning that 
for removal of doubt, the High Court shall not 
make an order or give direction or make a 
declaration on its own or in the nature of suo 
motu exercise of jurisdiction beyond the contents 
of any application filed under clause (1), Senator 
Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, ASC submits that 
Article 199(1)(a)(i) of the Constitution makes it 
clear that this Court can pass an order or direction 
to a person performing functions within its 
territorial jurisdiction in connection with the 
affairs of the Federation, a Province or a local 
authority to do anything he is required by law 
to do, on an application of any aggrieved 
party, therefore, this Court is fully empowered to 
pass a direction in the instant petition.  
4. 
When further confronted how writ can be 
filed by a child under the age of three years, 
Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, ASC submits 
that Article 199 of the Constitution mentions that 
any aggrieved party may approach this Court but 
it does not specify the nature of party, thus, the 
Petitioner, being an aggrieved party, can agitate 
the issue before this Court under the Child Justice 
System. In this regard, he has drawn attention 

3 
W.P.No.69910/2024 
towards the judgment passed by this Court (at 
Rawalpindi Bench) in the case of Zafar Khizer 
versus Federation of Pakistan and others (PLD 
2023 Lahore 164) in which the concept about 
protection of fundamental rights of child citizens 
of this country, as enshrined in Chapters 1 and 2 
(under Part-II) of the Constitution, has been 
further elaborated. He has read from paragraph-2 
of this judgment, relevant part of which is 
reproduced hereunder for ease of the matter: 
“…..The Petitioner has sought directions 
to both the Federal as well as the 
Provincial Governments to declare the 
fundamental rights of child citizens, 
including right to nutritious food, right to 
proper development (to maximize benefit 
from education) and right to education, as 
an unqualified right and to further expand 
the said rights in light of provisions of 
Articles 4, 9, 14, 25A and 38 of the 
Constitution. The first issue to be resolved 
by this Court is whether the word child 
citizen can be referred in the Constitution 
in light of different words used in the 
Constitution i.e. (a) citizen; (b) party; (c) 
person; and (d) individual in order to 
invoke such provisions. In this regard, 
stance of the learned counsel for the 
Petitioner is that the Constitution itself 
elucidates the word children under the 
newly added Article 25A, which specifies 
that free and compulsory education is 
fundamental right of all the children of the 
age of five to sixteen years. They further 
asserted that the word “children” is 
mentioned in Article 11(3) and also used in 
Article 25(3) while Article 35 of the 
Constitution protects the marriage, the 
family, the mother and the child, hence, the 
word child used in the Constitution can be 
stretched with the words citizen and 
person.” 

4 
W.P.No.69910/2024 
He maintains that in Zafar Khizer Case (supra), 
this Court followed Doctrine of Intergenerational 
Rights developed by Supreme Court of Philippine 
in  Oposa versus Factoran, G.R.No.101083, 224 
S.C.R.A. 792 (1993), recognizing the doctrine of 
intergenerational responsibility of the environment 
in the Philippine legal system. In the said case, the 
children became party to protect their future 
generation and despite the fact that the 
Respondents (of said case) did not take issue  
with the Petitioners’ legal standing, the Court of 
Philippine nevertheless addressed the “special 
and novel element” of the Petitioners representing 
their generation and generations yet unborn by 
strengthening the Doctrine of Intergenerational 
Responsibility by holding that: 
“We find no difficulty in ruling that they 
can, for themselves, for others of their 
generation 
and 
for 
the 
succeeding 
generations, file a class suit. Their 
personality to sue in behalf of the 
succeeding generations can only be based 
on 
the 
concept 
of 
intergenerational 
responsibility insofar as the right to a 
balanced 
and 
healthful 
ecology 
is 
concerned. Such a right, as hereinafter 
expounded, considers the "rhythm and 
harmony of nature." Nature means the 
created world in its entirety. Such rhythm 
and harmony indispensably include, inter 
alia, the judicious disposition, utilization, 
management, renewal and conservation of 
the country's forest, mineral, land, waters, 
fisheries, wildlife, off-shore areas and 
other natural resources to the end that 
their 
exploration, 
development 
and 
utilization be equitably accessible to the 
present as well as future generations. 
Needless to say, every generation has a 
responsibility to the next to preserve that 
rhythm and harmony for the full enjoyment 

5 
W.P.No.69910/2024 
of a balanced and healthful ecology. Put a 
little differently, the minors' assertion of 
their right to a sound environment 
constitutes, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
performance of their obligation to ensure 
the protection of that right for the 
generations to come.” 
 
He maintains that the basic issue for which the 
intervention of this Court is being sought, is the 
lack of interest on part of the Government in 
fulfilling its obligation and duty to enforce the 
provisions contained in Section 15 of the Act 
since the time of its induction, i.e the year 1997. 
He has read the “Preamble” of the Act, which 
clearly states that it has been enacted for           
the protection, conservation, rehabilitation and 
improvement of the environment, prevention 
and control of the pollution, promotion of 
sustainable development, and for the matters 
connected therewith and incidental thereto. He 
strenuously states that after lapse of a long period 
of about twenty seven years, no substantial steps 
have been taken by the Respondents/authority 
concerned so far for control of the air pollution. 
He has pointed out that the Air Quality Life Index 
(the “AQLI”) Report for Pakistan indicates that 
air pollution has led to a significant decrease in 
life expectancy, particularly in the Province of 
Punjab where it is estimated to be reduced by 5.5 
years and presently, the average life expectancy 
in our country is around 67 years, which reflects 
severe impact of poor air quality on public health. 
He next argues that the Lahore city has been 
declared as one of the most polluted cities in the 

6 
W.P.No.69910/2024 
world and core cause of this pollution is the 
vehicular emissions, which as per a report 
prepared by the Urban Unit of Punjab’s Planning 
& Development Department, is now reached to 
83-percent (originating from the transportation 
sector) but the concerned authority, forum as well 
as the department has failed to regulate the said 
vehicular 
emissions 
by 
applying 
relevant 
provisions of the 2013 Rules. He contends that 
though the Act was enacted in 1997 when it was 
the subject of Federal Government but after 
eighteenth amendment to the Constitution on 
15.04.2010, it has become the Provincial subject 
through induction of the Punjab Environmental 
Protection (Amendment) Act, 2012, therefore, 
this Court can take cognizance of the matter.  
5. 
In response to another query raised by this 
Court that under which law the Petitioner is 
seeking the aforesaid direction and what is the 
jurisprudence developed by superior Courts of the 
country on the issue in hand, Mr. Jahanzeb 
Sukhera, Advocate contends that the Respondent, 
Environmental Protection Agency, (the “EPA”), 
is established under Section 5 of the Act with the 
functions & powers as defined under Sections 6 
and 7 of the Act and it can take necessary 
steps/action under Section 11 read with Section 
16 of the Act to control the air pollution. He 
claims that the issue of air pollution has not been 
addressed by the EPA for revising the Punjab 
Environmental Quality Control Standards (the 
“PEQs”) for ambient air and industrial gaseous 
emissions, as provided under Section 6(1)(e) of 

7 
W.P.No.69910/2024 
the Act. He argues that it is necessary to maintain 
a healthy environment in the City of Lahore and 
throughout the Punjab to (i) revise the PEQs for 
ambient air and industrial gaseous emissions; and 
(ii) make regulations for installation of pollution 
control devices or other equipment and fuel, in 
order to control the air pollution. He states that air 
pollution is defined under Sub-Section (iii) of 
Section 2 of the Act and if the PEQs are not 
revised or regulations for checking maintenance 
of motors are not made under the 2013 Rules in a 
timely fashion then it will cause more adverse 
effect to the environment of Lahore as well as the 
entire Province. He submits that the non-action 
on part of the Government to control the air 
pollution is also against the principles settled by 
the superior Courts of the country from time to 
time on climate justice and in this connection, 
reference can be made to the judgments reported 
as Ms. Shehla Zia and others versus WAPDA 
(PLD 1994 SC 693) (right to clean environment), 
Asghar Leghari versus Federation of Pakistan 
and others (PLD 2018 Lahore 364) (right to 
environment/water justice); General Secretary 
Salt Miners Labour Union (CBA) Khewra, 
Jhelum versus The Director, Industries & 
Mineral Development Punjab Lahore (1994 
SCMR 2061) (right to clean water), Government 
of 
Balochistan 
through 
Additional 
Chief 
Secretary versus Azizullah Memon and 16 others 
(PLD 1993 SC 341) (right to access to justice), 
Al-Jehad Trust through Raees-ul-Mujahidin 
Habib Al-Wahabul Khairi, Advocate Supreme 

8 
W.P.No.69910/2024 
Court and another versus Federation of Pakistan 
and others (PLD 1997 SC 84), Khan Asfandyar 
Wali and others versus Federation of Pakistan 
through Cabinet Division, Islamabad and others 
(PLD 2001 SC 607), Arshad Mehmood and 
others versus Government of Punjab through 
Secretary, Transport Civil Secretariat, Lahore 
and others (PLD 2005 SC 193), (PLD 2011 SC 
619) Suo Moto Case No.13 of 2009 (Nexus 
between Articles 9 and 38), Fiaqat Hussain and 
others versus Federation of Pakistan through 
Secretary, Planning and Development Division, 
Islamabad and others (PLD 2012 SC 224), 2013 
SCMR 1752 (right to reputation), Lahore 
Development Authority through D.G. and others 
versus Ms. Imrana Tiwana and others (2015 
SCMR 1739), Shahab Usto versus Government 
of Sindh through Chief Secretary and others 
(2017 SCMR 732) (right to clean water and 
sewerage disposal), Nadir Ali versus Medical 
Superintendent, Civil Hospital, Larkana and 9 
others (PLD 2017 Sindh 448) and Messrs GETZ 
PHARMA (Pvt.) Ltd. through Authorised Person 
versus Federation of Pakistan, through Secretary, 
Ministry of National Regulation and Services and 
another (PLD 2017 Sindh 157) (right to health). 
He has particularly referred to another judgment 
passed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the 
case of Pollution of Environment Caused by 
Smoke, Emitting Vehicles, Traffic Muddle (1996 
SCMR 543), in which directions were issued to 
the concerned authority to streamline the process 
of checking as a first step in eliminating the 

9 
W.P.No.69910/2024 
pollution caused by the smoke emitting vehicles. 
He pleads that the basic source of pollution in the 
Lahore city as well as the Province of Punjab is 
the motor vehicles, as mentioned above, 
therefore, specific direction was issued by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan to first take steps for 
implementing the check and balance policy on 
the motor vehicles in the aforesaid judgment 
which is binding on all the Governmental 
authorities under Article 189 read with Article 
190 of the Constitution.  
6. 
Mr. Jahanzeb Sukhera, Advocate next 
submits that under Section 15 of the Act no 
person shall operate a motor vehicle from which 
air pollutants or noise are being emitted in an 
amount, concentration or level which is in excess 
of the PEQs and the owner of such vehicle shall 
install a pollution control device/equipment,     
use fuel and undergo maintenance or testing of 
motor vehicle for control of air pollution and 
noise pollution, as may be prescribed under the 
regulations. In this regard, he has drawn attention 
of the Court towards the provisions of Section 
33(2)(i) of the Act, which reads as under:- 
“33. Power to make regulations._ (1) For 
carrying out the purposes of this Act, 
the [Provincial 
Agency] 
may, 
by 
notification in the official Gazette and with 
the approval of the [Government], make 
regulations not inconsistent with the 
provisions of this Act or the rules made 
thereunder. 
(2) 
In 
particular 
and 
without 
prejudice to the generality of the 
foregoing power, such regulations 
may provide for–  
      (a)   ---------------------------------- 

10 
W.P.No.69910/2024 
      (b)   ---------------------------------- 
      (c)   ---------------------------------- 
      (d)   ---------------------------------- 
      (e)   ----------------------------------   
      (f)   ----------------------------------- 
      (g)  ----------------------------------- 
      (h)  ----------------------------------- 
      (i) installation of devices in, use   
 
 of fuels by, and maintenance 
 
 and testing of motor vehicles 
 
 for control of air and noise 
 
 pollution.” 
  
He contends that the regulations are to be made 
by the Respondents without any delay, which has 
not been done so far. This violates fundamental 
rights of the Petitioner and other citizens of the 
country as prescribed in the judgments passed by 
this Court on similar issue of controlling air 
pollution in the cases of Mrs. Anjum Irfan versus 
Lahore Development Authority through Director-
General and others (PLD 2002 Lahore 555) and 
Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and 4 others versus 
Government 
of 
Punjab, 
through 
Housing, 
Physical 
and 
Environmental 
Planning 
Department, and 3 others (PLD 2007 Lahore 
403) and subsequently, by a Division Bench of 
High Court of Sindh in the case of Islam Hussain 
versus City District Government and others (2007 
CLC 530). He highlights the point that in Syed 
Mansoor Ali Shah’s Case (supra), the Court 
suggested various measures for combating 
pollution, which included, inter alia, efficient 
utilization of solar energy, more plantations of 
trees, measures to introduce electric rail cars, and 
increasing the role of the media in promoting 
public awareness. In the said case, this Court 

11 
W.P.No.69910/2024 
directed the “Lahore Clean Air Commission” to 
recommend measures for the improvement of 
Lahore's air quality and the said commission not 
only set up sub-committees with respect to clean 
fuel, rickshaws, public transport and coordination 
with local councils but also attention of all the oil 
companies was invited by the Clean Fuel Sub-
committee to support the work of the said 
commission, and some of their representatives 
attended a national workshop in Lahore convened 
by the commission to formulate a joint strategy 
for air quality. Ultimately, the said case was 
disposed of by the Court with directions to the 
Transport Department, City District Government 
Lahore and the EPA to introduce CNG Euro II 
buses for public transport, phase out existing 
buses within two years by December 2007, set up 
dedicated bus lanes, implement a cap age of ten 
years 
for 
buses, 
and 
ban 
four 
stroke 
rickshaws. Whereas in Islam Hussain (2007 
CLC 530), the Division Bench of High Court of 
Sindh directed the DIG Traffic Police to ensure 
that no smoke-emitting vehicle or one causing 
noise pollution should ply in the city of Karachi 
after three months from the day the judgment was 
passed in 2007, and further that strict action be 
taken against the offenders. 
7. 
Suffice to mention here that this Court has 
to protect and promote child justice system as 
also envisaged by the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
on various occasions, while hearing a number of 
similar cases. Under Rule 3(3) of the Punjab 
Government Rules of Business, 2011 (the “2011 

12 
W.P.No.69910/2024 
Rules”), business of the Government has been 
distributed amongst several Departments in the 
manner indicated in the Second Schedule and 
functions of the Secretary are described under 
Rule 10 of the 2011 Rules, which is reproduced 
hereunder for ease of the matter:- 
“10. Functions of the Secretary.– (1) A 
Secretary shall: 
(a) 
be the official head of the 
 
Department 
and 
be 
 
responsible for its efficient 
 
administration and discipline,

assigned to the Department 
 
and for the observance of laws 
 
and rules, including these 
 
rules, in the Department;  
(b)  
be responsible to the Minister 
 
for 
the 
business 
of 
the 
 
Department and keep him 
 
informed about the working of 
 
the 
Department, 
and 
of 
 
important cases disposed of 
 
without 
reference 
to 
the 
 
Minister;  
(c)  
assist the Minister in the 
 
formulation of policy and 
 
bring to the notice of the 
 
Minister cases required to be

to 
the 
Chief 
 
Minister under the rules;  
(d) 
execute 
the 
sanctioned

(e)  
submit, with the approval 
 
of the  Minister, proposals for 
 
legislation to the Cabinet;  
(f)  
keep 
the 
Chief 
Secretary 
 
informed of important cases 
 
disposed 
of 
in

13 
W.P.No.69910/2024 
 
may be disposed of by 
 
an officer subordinate 
 
to the Secretary; and 
 
ii) specific orders and 
 
instructions 
to 
its 
 
officers for the conduct 
 
of the business assigned

(2) While submitting a case for the 
 
orders of the Minister, the Secretary 
 
shall suggest a definite line of 
 
action.  
 
(3) Where the Minister’s orders 
 
appear to contravene any law, rules, 
 
regulations or Government policy, 
 
the Secretary shall resubmit the case 
 
to the Minister inviting his attention 
 
to 
the 
relevant 
law, 
rules, 
 
regulations  or Government policy, 
 
and if the Minister disagrees with 
 
the Secretary, the Minister may refer 
 
the case to the Chief Minister for 
 
orders.” 
 
This Court has already strengthened the scope of 
Rule 10 of the 2011 Rules in the case of PIA 
Officers Cooperative Housing Society Limited 
versus Province of Punjab etc. (2024 CLC 947 
947) (Rawalpindi Bench) by holding that 
Secretary, being official head of the Department, 
can look into the administrative affairs of the 
Department. In the instant case, the Secretary, 
Environmental Protection Department, Lahore/ 
Respondent No.1 is the official head of the 
department and he is fully empowered to make  
(i) proper legislation; (ii) policy formulation; and 
(iii) planning in respect of various fields related 
to environment, as specified under the 2011 
Rules. He may also take all the necessary 
measures for perfect administration of the 
relevant laws.

W.P.No.69910/2024 
8. 
This is a first impression case and further 
interpretation of the (newly inserted) Article 9A 
of the Constitution with regard to protection of 
intergenerational rights of future generation read 
with the provisions of Articles 9, 14 and 3 of the 
Constitution is required. Moreover, “Preamble” 
of the Act deals with the protection, conservation, 
rehabilitation and improvement of environment 
as well as prevention and control of the 
pollution couple with the fact that Section 2(xlii) 
of the Act defines the “sustainable development” 
as the development which meets the needs of the 
present generation without compromising the 
ability of future generations to meet their needs. 
Admit. Notice be issued to the Respondents for 
12.11.2024. Secretary, Environmental Protection 
Department, Lahore (Respondent No.1) and the 
Director General, EPA (Respondent No.2) will 
appear in person on the next date to explain what 
steps have been taken by them to control air 
pollution in the City of Lahore under Section 15 
read with the provisions of Section 33(2) of the 
Act. As the big cause of pollution in the city is 
the vehicular emissions, a senior and responsible 
officer from the office of Respondent No.3 shall 
also appear on the next date to inform the Court 
what steps have been taken by them for 
maintaining a clean and healthy environment in 
the City of Lahore.
