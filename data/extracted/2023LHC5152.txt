Mr. Muhammad Shahzad Shaukat, Advocate. 
 
On approval of Board of Directors of National 
Transmission & Dispatch Company Limited (hereinafter 
referred to as “NTDC”) a post of Deputy Managing 
Director was created and advertised in the newspaper. The 
appellant being eligible applied for the said post and after 
being interviewed by the Board of Directors, he was 
shortlisted. The appointment of the appellant was, however, 
approved finally by the Board in its 221st meeting held on 
22nd March, 2022 and formal notification of the 
appointment of the appellant was issued on 29th March, 
2022. In furtherance whereof, the appellant was appointed 
as Deputy Managing Director (AD&M) on contract basis. A 
formal contract was also executed, however, he was later on 
confronted with a letter dated 09th December, 2022, 
whereby Deputy Secretary Government of Pakistan 
Ministry of Energy (Power Division) in a letter addressed to 
the Chairman, Board of Directors, “NTDC” conveyed that 
the appointment of the appellant has come under extensive 
scrutiny at higher forums. The said letter, presumably, was 
on the basis of some complaints against the appellant 
proceeded to direct the Board of Directors “NTDC” to 
dispense with the services of the appellant as Deputy 
Managing Director (AD&M) by serving one month’s 
notice. The letter was purportedly issued by the Secretary

Power Division. This constrained the appellant to file Writ 
Petition No.83092 of 2022, which was admitted for regular 
hearing, however, on withdrawal of the letter dated 09th 
December, 2022 by the respondents vide letter dated 06th 
January, 2023 the appellant withdrew his petition vide order 
dated 02nd February, 2023. This followed a one sided 
inquiry against the appellant in pursuance to which a report 
was placed before respondent No.5 for terminating the 
appointment of appellant. The case of the appellant was, 
however, placed before the Board of Directors as agenda 
item No.6, whereby Board in its 247th meeting held on 31st 
May, 2023 decided to terminate the services of the 
petitioner without cause followed a letter of termination 
dated 31st May, 2023. The appellant challenged the 
notification through Writ Petition No.40827 of 2023 but 
remained unsuccessful as it was dismissed by way of order 
dated 16th June, 2023, hence this appeal under Section 3 of 
the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972. 
2. 
At the very outset we when confronted learned 
counsel for the appellant with the Court query as to how the 
constitutional petition was maintainable on behalf of the 
appellant being contract employee against his termination, 
he submitted that the notification of termination would 
amount to stigmatize the future of the appellant. He added 
that constitutional petition was maintainable as it offends 
the fundamental rights of the appellant as guaranteed under 
the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. 
3. 
After having heard learned counsel for the appellant 
at considerable length, we have perused the record. 
4. 
It is an admitted position on the record that the 
appellant was appointed as Deputy Managing Director 
(AD&M) being contract employee. Clause 12 of the 
agreement deals with the termination which reads as under:- 

I.C.A. No.60992 of 2023 
 
~3~ 
 
“12. 
TERMINATION 
12.1. Termination At Will: Termination effected without 
cause shall be considered Termination at will and may be 
affected by either Party at any time by giving notice of 
termination to the other Party as follows: 
12.1.1. 
The Company may terminate the Employment 
at its discretion, without cause, by giving not less than 
Ninety (90) days’ prior written notice of termination at 
will to the Employee, or payment of three (3) month’s 
salary in lieu of notice. 
12.1.2. 
The Employee may terminate his Employment 
at any time by giving not less than Ninety (90) days’ prior 
written notice of termination at will to the Company. 
12.1.3. 
Following issuance of a notice of termination at 
will by the Company or the Employee (as the case may 
be), the Company shall advise the Employee whether or 
not it requires the Employee to continue to perform his 
services 
as 
Deputy 
Managing 
Director 
(Asset 
Development & Management) during the notice period, 
and such decision shall be binding on the Employee. 
12.2. Termination For Cause: The Company may terminate 
the Employment for cause by issuing a notice of termination 
for cause, which notice shall immediately terminate and cease 
the Employment from continuing any further. For purposes of 
this Agreement, cause shall mean: 
12.2.1. the Employee’s breach of any of the terms of this 
Agreement, or material breach of the Company’s policies, 
guidelines, regulations or other directions applicable to the 
Employee from time to time; 
12.2.2. the Employee’s commissions of act(s) or 
omission(s) which have, have had, or are likely to have, a 
material adverse effect on the business, financial condition 
or reputation of the Company, its subsidiaries or affiliates; 
12.2.3. the Employee’s conviction (including guilty plea) 
of any crime of theft, dishonesty or moral turpitude; or 
12.2.4. the Employee’s omission, dereliction or negligence 
in the performance of his duties, or breach of any duty of 
care, duty of good faith or duty of loyalty towards the 
Company. 
12.3. In case the Company terminates the Employment 
without cause, the Employee shall be entitled to receive Three 
(3) month’s severance pay in addition to any salary paid to the 
Employee in lieu of notice.” 
It is thus evident from the agreement itself that the 
employment of the appellant can be terminated by the 
company at its discretion without any cause by giving 
ninety days prior written notice of termination at will to the 
employee, or payment of three month’s salary in lieu 
thereof.  
5. 
Law is well settled that a contract employee is 
precluded to invoke the constitutional jurisdiction of this 
Court with regard to the matters relating to the terms and 

I.C.A. No.60992 of 2023 
 
~4~ 
 
conditions of service, as the relationship of such employee 
and department shall be deemed to be as of master and 
servant. Needless to reiterate that in the case of breach of 
any of the terms and conditions of contract or any other 
issue ensuing therefrom the grouse can only be remedied by 
filing a suit for damages. Reliance in this respect can be 
placed on GOVERNMENT OF KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA through 
Secretary Forest, Peshawar and others versus SHER AMAN and 
others (2022 SCMR 406) wherein the Hon’ble Apex Court, 
while dilating upon the issue in hand held as under :- 
“13. 
Even otherwise, the Respondents were contractual 
employees of a project which was governed by a MoU. 
They were employees of a corporate entity. In our opinion, 
they were governed by the principle of "Master and 
Servant". The stance taken by the learned High Court is 
overly simplistic and against the principles of employment 
law. It is the prerogative of the employer to decide the terms 
and conditions of an employee's contract. It is not for the 
court to step into the shoes of the employer and force him to 
employ someone for whom there is no available post and 
even if there is one, without following due process, 
procedure and criteria. The relationship is governed by the 
principle of master and servant and except in exceptional 
circumstances; disputes arising there from are beyond the 
jurisdiction and parameters of the powers of the High Court 
under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan. We have asked the learned ASC for 
the said Respondents to point us to any rule creating a right 
to regularization of the Respondents. He has been unable to 
do so. It is trite that regularization cannot take place without 
statutory backing. The Respondents, being contract 
employees, were governed by the principle of "Master and 
Servant" and could not approach the High Court to seek 
redressal of their grievances. Reliance in this regard is 
placed on Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Workers 
Welfare Board v. Raheel Ali Gohar (2021 PLC (C.S.) Note 
125 Supreme Court) where in it was held that:- 
"In addition to these issues, we also find ourselves at 
odds with the fact that the present Respondents 
approached the High Court in its writ jurisdiction to 
seek regularization without there being any law 
conferring a right that may have been denied and was 
sought to be enforced by way of a petition under Article 
199 of the Constitution. It is settled law that as 
contractual employees, the relationship between the 
Respondents and the Appellant is governed but the 
principle of master and servant. In these circumstances, 
the Respondents did not have the right to approach the 
High Court to seek redressal of their grievances relating 
to regularization. As noted above, in case of a 
contractual dispute the Respondents could have sought 
appropriate redressal of their grievances before a 

I.C.A. No.60992 of 2023 
 
~5~ 
 
competent court of law. However, only by virtue of 
being contract employees, no automatic right of 
regularization 
has 
accrued 
in 
their 
favour." 
(Underlining is ours) 
WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF THE TERMS AND 
CONDITIONS OF THE APPOINTMENT ORDERS OF 
THE RESPONDENTS? 
14. 
Regularization is a policy matter which necessarily 
requires backing of the law. In the absence of any law, 
policy or rules, an employee cannot knock on the door of 
the High Court for regularization of his/her services. The 
learned High Court, despite the fact that there is ample 
material on the record that establishes that the Respondents 
had agreed to the terms and conditions of their contracts, 
regularized the services of the Respondents. The Project 
Policy governing the projects in which the Respondents 
were working clearly and unequivocally states that after the 
said projects come to an end, employees working in the said 
projects would have no right to claim regularization. The 
same stipulation is made in the service contracts of the 
Respondents. 
That 
being 
the 
case, 
the 
order 
of 
regularization lacked any legal basis or foundation. 
Reliance in this regard is placed on the case of Khushal 
Khan Khattak University through Vice-Chancellor and 
others v. Jabran Ali Khan and others (2021 SCMR 977) 
wherein, in an identical situation, this court held as 
follows:- 
"The learned counsel for the Respondents has not been 
able to show us any law which conferred a right upon 
the Respondents to be regularized. The assertion of the 
learned ASC that since others were regularized, the 
Respondents should also be regularized despite there 
being no statutory basis has not impressed us. As noted 
above, the Respondents could not claim regularization 
as a matter of right. Even otherwise, all the appointment 
orders of the Respondents clearly state that they would 
have no right to claim regularization. Therefore, the 
Respondents cannot disown the terms and conditions of 
their own employment contracts and claim permanent 
employment when at the very inception of their 
employment they had accepted contractual employment 
on the conditions that they would have no right to claim 
regularization". (Underlining is ours) 
The same view was further reiterated by the Supreme Court 
of Pakistan in the case of PROVINCE OF PUNJAB through Chief 
Secretary, Lahore and others versus Prof. Dr. JAVED IQBAL and 
others (2022 SCMR 897). Reference in this regard can also be 
made to 
GOVERNMENT 
OF 
KHYBER 
PAKHTUNKHWA, 
WORKERS WELFARE BOARD through Chairman vs. RAHEEL ALI 
GOHAR and others (2020 SCMR 2068), Qazi MUNIR AHMED vs. 
RAWALPINDI MEDICAL COLLEGE AND ALLIED HOSPITAL 
through Principal and others (2019 SCMR 648), Maj. (Retd.) Syed 

I.C.A. No.60992 of 2023 
 
~6~ 
 
MUHAMMAD TANVEER ABBAS and another vs. FEDERATION OF 
PAKISTAN through Secretary, Ministry of Interior and another (2019 
SCMR 984), CHAIRMAN NADRA, ISLAMABAD, through Chairman, 
Islamabad and another vs. MUHAMMAD ALI SHAH and others 
(2017 SCMR 1979) and M/o IPC through Secretary and others vs. 
ARBAB ALTAF HUSSAIN and others (2014 SCMR 1573). 
6. 
After having an overview of the principles settled by 
the Apex Court in the above referred judgments, we are of 
the considered opinion that constitutional petition before 
this Court is not competent. Furthermore the contract of the 
appellant has been terminated in the light of terms and 
conditions of his employment contained in the employment 
agreement, so this Court in exercise of constitutional 
jurisdiction cannot give new life to a terminated contract. In 
other words, it would amount to beat the dead horse. 
7. 
So far contention of learned counsel for the appellant 
that by way of impugned notification of termination of 
contract the future of appellant has been stigmatized, suffice 
to observe that from the bare perusal of impugned 
notification it is crystal clear that termination of contract 
was without any cause in terms of clause 12.1.1 of the 
employment agreement. 
8. 
In view of above discussion, we do not entertain any 
doubt in our mind that order of the learned Single Judge in 
Chamber resulting into dismissal of the constitutional 
petition is unexceptionable. The instant appeal thus fails 
and is dismissed in limine.
