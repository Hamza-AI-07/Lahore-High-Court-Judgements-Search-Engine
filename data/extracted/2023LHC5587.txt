“Constitution”) assails the appointment of the Respondent No.5 
(Muhammad Akram) as Member Judicial, Appellate Tribunal Inland 
Revenue (“ATIR”), Islamabad through Notification dated 26.04.2019 
(the “impugned Notification”) alleging that the said Respondent is 
holding the above post without lawful authority and thus is not fit to 
hold the public office, hence seeking a writ of quo warranto under 
Article 199(1)(b)(ii) of the “Constitution” by filing it on 01.06.2023 
after lapse of about four (04) years. 
I. 
OVERTURE OF THE CASE 
2. 
The Court will examine the words used in Article 199(1)(b)(ii) 
of the “Constitution” for determination of the maintainability of writ 
of quo warranto with the focus on laches and the meaning of the word 
‘public office’ in light of recent doctrine of textualism developed by 
this Court in “Ms SERVICE GLOBAL INDUSTRIES LIMITED 
through Usman Liaqat versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN etc” 
(PLD 2023 Lahore 471 = 2023 PTD 1120), whereby the Court has 
held that Doctrine of Textualism envisages a method of statutory 
interpretation asserting that a statute should be interpreted according 
to its plain meaning and not according to the intent of the legislature, 
the statutory purpose, or the legislative history. This judgment will 
first examine the (i) aetiology of filing numerous quo warranto 
petitions before High Court including Principal Seat and its allied 
Benches i.e. Lahore High Court, Rawalpindi Bench, Lahore High 
Court, Multan Bench and Lahore High Court, Bahawalpur Bench. The 
word aetiology means the investigation or attribution of the case or 
reason for something often expressed in terms of historical or 
mythical explanation. Hence, unless the good and solid jurisprudential 
reasons are given in the judgment and test has been made out, the 
Court can control the filing of such petition by limiting the heterodoxy 
by various Benches and Court. Moreover, this Court will also 
examine the (ii) anatomy of writ of quo warranto under Article 199 
of the “Constitution” which is under Part-VII, Chapter-3 of the 

 
Writ Petition No.1938 of 2023    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3 
“Constitution” and (iii) pathology of Article 199 of the Constitution 
which deals with the Powers of High Court and its jurisdiction. The 
Court is aware of the fact that under writ of quo warranto there is no 
requirement for the Petitioner to be an aggrieved person, rather the 
writ of quo warranto can be instituted by a person despite he may not 
come within the meaning of word ‘aggrieved person’. Further for 
issuance of a writ of quo warranto, the person invoking the 
jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 199 of the Constitution 
is not required to fulfill the stringent conditions required for 
bringing himself within the meaning of an aggrieved person as held 
by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in “JAWAD AHMAD MIR versus 
Prof. Dr. IMTIAZ ALI KHAN, VICE CHANCELLOR, UNIVERSITY 
OF SWABI, DISTRICT SWABI, KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA and 
others” (2023 SCMR 162). While discussing the anatomy and 
pathology of Article 199 of the “Constitution”, the Court shall frame 
moot points with anatomy of the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court 
of Pakistan and (iv) legal anthology of quo warrnato will also be 
discussed in the light of Section 223-A of Government of the India 
Act, 1935, which was later continued in the Constitution of 1956, 
Constitution of 1962 and the Constitution of 1973. However, the 
Article 199 of the “Constitution” starts with words Jurisdiction of 
High Court, which is subject to the “Constitution” when there is no 
other remedy available, any party can bring quo warranto because 
Article 199(1)(a) deals with aggrieved person and Article 199(1)(b) 
not necessarily required to be moved by an aggrieved person. The 
judgments of Supreme Court of Pakistan though have annunciated 
that there should be a time frame in bringing the writ petition of quo 
warranto. This Court by framing moot points will go through the 
guidance regarding the issue of laches and maintainability of a writ of 
quo warranto in connection therewith as the appointment of the 
Respondent No.5 was challenged by the Petitioner after lapse of a 
considerable time period.

II. 
CONTEXT OF THE CASE  
3. 
Succinctly, the Respondent No.5 Muhammad Akram was 
appointed as a “Member Judicial, ATIR” vide the “impugned 
Notification” for a probationary period of one year under the Civil 
Servant Act, 1973 (the “Act”) and the same was extendable for a 
further period of one year. As per version of the Petitioner, the 
Respondent No.5 is receiving benefits equivalent to a BS-21 Federal 
Government Officer despite being not qualified for such a position on 
the sole ground that previously he was accused of FIR No.297 of 2005 
registered under Sections 420, 468 and 471 PPC, and his bail was 
cancelled by the Supreme Court of Pakistan vide order dated 
15.12.2005. The case was resolved through compromise, which is not 
considered an honourable acquittal. Therefore, the Petitioner’s stance 
is that the appointment of the Respondent No.5 violates proviso to 
Section 6 of the “Act”.  
III. 
PETITIONER’S SUBMISSIONS 
 
4. 
Mr. Tanveer Iqbal, ASC, inter alia argues that the Respondent 
No.5 was not competent for the post due to his involvement in a 
criminal case; that proviso to Section 6 of the “Act” requires 
satisfactory character verification for a civil servant’s probation 
period, but the Respondent No.5 was appointed without this 
verification; that the said Respondent was not acquitted on merits but 
his acquittal was based on a compromise, which cannot be termed as 
honourable acquittal. In support of his arguments, learned counsel has 
relied on “PRESIDENT NATIONAL BANK OF PAKISTAN and others 
versus WAQAS AHMED KHAN” (2023 SCMR 766), “JAWAD 
AHMAD MIR versus Prof. DR. IMTIAZ ALI KHAN, Vice Chancellor, 
University of Swabi, District Swabi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and 
others” (2023 SCMR 162), “SAQIB ALI versus GOVERNMENT OF 
PUNJAB and others” (2023 PLC (CS) 310) and “MIRZA SHAHZEB 
versus CITY POLICE OFFICER etc” (2023 PLC (CS) 749)

IV. 
RESPONDENTS’ SUBMISSIONS 
Submissions of Respondents No.1 to 4 
5. 
Malik Muhammad Siddique Awan, Additional Attorney 
General has raised objections to the maintainability of this petition on 
the ground of laches as the petition in hand was filed more than four 
years after issuance of the “impugned Notification”. He relied on 
“SAQIB ALI versus GOVERNMENT OF PUNJAB and others” (2023 
PLC (CS) 310), wherein the Supreme Court of Pakistan discussed the 
limitation period in such like cases and also defined a public office. 
Mr. Arshad Mahmood Malik, Assistant Attorney General maintained 
that the appointment of the Respondent No.5 was made by the Federal 
Government strictly as per Section 130 of the “Ordinance”.  
  
Submissions on behalf of the Respondent No.5 
6. 
 Barrister Asfandyar Khan Tareen, representing Respondent 
No.5, objected qua maintainability of the petition inter alia on the 
grounds that it was filed with the ulterior motive of defaming the 
senior-most Judicial Member after a significant delay; that 
Respondent No.5 was acquitted in all criminal charges before his 
appointment on the basis of compromise which is considered 
honourable; that Respondent No.5, with a 28-year legal career and 
having passed the Federal Public Service Commission exam, was 
rightly appointed as Member Judicial; that the acquittal of the 
Respondent No.5, in a criminal case is an honourable, leaving behind 
no negative impact upon his past character to create bar against his 
appointment in question. He has referred to judgments reported in 
“DR. MUHAMMAD ISLAM versus GOVERNMENT OF NWFP, etc.” 
(1998 SCMR 1993), “MALIK MUHAMMAD EJAZ CHANNAR 
versus THE STATE” (PLD 2022 Lahore 427), “NAIMAT ULLAH 
versus THE STATE” (2021 P.Cr.L.J 1339 Sindh), “MST. 
KULSOOM versus SESSIONS JUDGE” (2018 MLD 1484 Sindh), 
“MUHAMMAD QASIM versus MUHAMMAD IQBAL” (2017 YLR 
752), “MUHAMMAD ZAFAR versus RUSTAM ALI” (2017 SCMR 

 
Writ Petition No.1938 of 2023

“RAJA 
MUHAMMAD

“NADEEM AHMAD versus SAIF-UR-REHMAN” (2021 MLD 354). 
V. 
POINTS OF DETERMINATION 
7. 
In order to examine the language of Article 199 of the 
“Constitution” and from the arguments advanced by the parties, the 
following moot points have arisen.  
(1) 
Whether the acquittal of Respondent No.5 from 
a criminal case, based on a compromise, can be 
considered an honorable acquittal?  
(2) 
Whether the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (the 
“Ordinance”) provide any restrictions or 
conditions relating to character verification 
during the probationary period of Respondent 
No.5?  
(3) 
Whether 
the 
writ 
of 
quo 
warranto 
is 
maintainable? 
(4) 
Whether the writ petition is hit by laches? 
 
(5) 
Whether the office occupied by the respondent 
is a public one, and if so, is the respondent 
occupying this office lawfully? 
 
  
It is to be noted that whenever important constitutional issues 
are raised in a constitutional petition, the Courts always framed moot 
points in order to settle them strictly under Article 201 of the 
“Constitution”. Since prudent approach to decide the cases, the 
Courts have to follow the principles already developed by the 
Superior Court and this Court under Article 189 and 201 of the 
“Constitution”. In order to avoid deviation from heterodoxy 
jurisprudence as well as to decide the lis between parties on basis of 
orthodox principles, this Court has discussed in details regarding 
framing of moot points and settling them in “MUHAMMAD UMAIS 
Versus RAWALPINDI CANTONMENT BOARD etc” (PLD 2022 
Lahore 148) by holding that “After framing of issues on 
constitutional moot points, this Court has narrowed down the law 
points and determined the fundamental rights of the Petitioner but 

 
Writ Petition No.1938 of 2023    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7 
while rendering judgment, the constitutional petition filed under 
Article 199 of the Constitution, if the writ petition is admitted for 
regular hearing, and after perusing the record from the report and 
parawise comments, the Court has to render a decision strictly as per 
Articles 199 and 201 of the Constitution. The decision or order could 
be a judgment or an order passed on the constitutional petition filed 
under Article 199 of the Constitution but those decisions are made 
under the established law of precedent under Article 201 of the 
Constitution, to have a binding effect and its principles have to be 
followed later. Article 201 of the Constitution states that a decision of 
High Court if (i) it decides a question of law or is (ii) based upon or 
(iii) enunciates a principle of law be binding on subordinate Courts. 
In this case, writ petition was filed on 21.04.2021 and after hearing 
the parties on 28.04.2021, the Court while admitting the writ petition 
directed the parties to file written statement. Thereafter, written 
statement was filed by the Respondents and perused by this Court, 
hence, before proceedings further, the Court framed moot points in 
order to render a judgment under Article 201 of the Constitution. It is 
a settled norm that the decision on a question of law can only be made 
if question of law is framed and highlighted from the pleadings. In 
this case the Court on 02.06.2021 framed the constitutional moot 
points, mentioned above, in order to render a judgment, while keeping 
in mind the principles of law already established by the Superior 
Court, relied by both the counsel for the parties, then passed its 
decision on it to be called a decision or a judgment. Accordingly, the 
judgment then passed will consists of ratio decidendi, facts, 
arguments of the parties, moot points involved, and stare decisis and 
obiter dicta. The Constitution clearly empowers the Courts in 
Pakistan to render on these parameters regarding the question of law 
or based on question enunciated a principle of law. As every judgment 
of the Supreme Court is binding on all Courts under Article 189 of the 
Constitution, the same words are used in Article 201 of the 

 
Writ Petition No.1938 of 2023    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8 
Constitution but subject to Article 189 to follow its principle for 
consistency”. 
MOOT POINT NO.1  
Whether the acquittal of Respondent No.5 from a criminal 
case, based on a compromise can be considered an honorable 
acquittal? 
 
8. 
Mr. Tanveer Iqbal, ASC states that the criminal history of the 
Respondent No.5 is established vide FIR No.297 of 2005 and this 
factum disqualifies him from holding public office and though he 
was acquitted in that case on basis of a compromise, but said 
acquittal was not on merits, hence eventual result of said criminal 
case does not negate the serious allegations against him. While, 
Barrister Asfandyar Khan Tareen, Advocate for the Respondent 
No.5 submits that mere registration of an FIR against the Respondent 
No.5 is insufficient to deem his character as criminal, barring him 
from his impugned appointment and that too in a situation that 
aforementioned criminal case was got registered by uncle of 
Respondent No.5 in outcome of some family disputes. He further 
states that the matter was settled between the parties and the 
Respondent No.5 was acquitted by the Judicial Magistrate vide order 
dated 14.12.2006 and this order was upheld by the Additional 
Sessions Judge, Sargodha vide order dated 08.03.2008. 
9. 
A careful examination of the facts and arguments from both 
sides reveals that the FIR against the Respondent No.5 was registered 
by his real paternal uncle over a property dispute. This dispute was 
amicably settled among the parties through compromise leading to 
acquittal of the Respondent No.5. Therefore, the mere registration of 
an FIR against Respondent No.5 cannot be used as a definitive test to 
label him as having a bad character. As for as argument of an 
honorable acquittal is concerned, the Court is of the view that all 
acquittals including acquittal on compromise are honorable for the 
reason that the prosecution has not succeeded to prove their cases 
against the accused on the strength of evidence of unimpeachable 

 
Writ Petition No.1938 of 2023    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9 
character. There can be no acquittals, which may be said to be 
dishonorable and the law has not drawn any distinction between any 
types of acquittals. Reliance is placed on “DR. MUHAMMAD ISLAM 
versus GOVERNMENT OF NWFP, etc.” (1998 SCMR 1993). The 
Respondent No.5 was acquitted by the Judicial magistrate vide order 
dated 14.12.2006 and this order of acquittal was upheld by the 
Additional Sessions Judge, Sargodha vide order dated 08.03.2008. It 
shall, therefore, be presumed that the allegations leveled against him 
are baseless as, he has not been declared guilty. In presence of above 
meaning of "acquittal" the appellant is held to have committed no 
offence because the competent criminal courts have cleared him from 
an accusation or charge of crime. Moreover, once a person was 
acquitted by trial court, said person would stand shorn of stigma of 
any allegation and he would have to be deemed thereafter as innocent 
and having not committed any such crime. If acquittal of accused is 
not assailed before higher forum, such acquittal earned by accused 
from trial court, on whatsoever basis, would attain finality and 
pandora box of allegations could not be re-opened or used against 
him. In short, acquittal is an acquittal simpliciter and, must entail 
upon all consequences of pure acquittal. Reliance is placed on 
“MUMTAZ 
ALI 
SHAH 
versus 
CHAIRMAN, 
PAKISTAN 
TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANY LTD., H.Q., ISLAMABAD and 
6 others” (PLD 2002 Supreme Court 1060). Additionally, order of 
acquittal of accused shall erase, efface, obliterate and wash away his 
alleged or already adjudged guilt in the matter apart from leading to 
setting aside of his sentence or punishment, if any. Reliance is placed 
on “SUO MOTU CASE NO. 03 OF 2017” (PLD 2018 Supreme 
Court 703). 
MOOT POINT NO.2  
Whether the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (the “Ordinance”) 
provide any restrictions or conditions relating to character 
verification during the probationary period of Respondent 
No.5? 
 

 
Writ Petition No.1938 of 2023    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10 
10. 
Pertinently, the Respondent No.5 was appointed as a Judicial 
Member of the ATIR vide the “impugned Notification” issued under 
Section 130(3) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (the 
“Ordinance”). According to the learned counsel for the Respondent 
No.5, at the relevant time of his appointment, the Appointment of 
Income Tax Appellate Tribunal Member’s Rules, 1998 were in force 
having been issued vide SRO No. 5(1)/98. Aforementioned Section 
130 dealing with appointment of Judicial Member of ATIR is 
reproduced as follows: 
“130. Appointment of the Appellate Tribunal:- 
(1) There shall be established an Appellate 
Tribunal to exercise the functions conferred on 
the Tribunal by this Ordinance. 
(2) The Appellate Tribunal shall consist of a 
chairperson and such other judicial and 
accountant members as are appointed by the 
Federal Government having regard to the needs 
of the Tribunal. 
(3) A person may be appointed as a judicial 
member of the Appellate Tribunal if the 
person:- 
(a) has exercised the powers of a District 
Judge and is qualified to be a Judge of 
the High Court; 
(b) is or has been an advocate of a High 
Court and is qualified to be a Judge of 
the High Court; 
(c) is an officer of Inland Revenue 
Service in BS20 or above and is a law 
graduate. 
 
      (underlined by me) 
……………….. 
 
11. 
For appointment as Judicial Member of Income Tax Appellate 
Tribunal, two categories of persons had been provided under Section 
130(3) of the “Ordinance”, one who had exercised powers of District 
Judge and the other who had been an Advocate of High Court, and 
both categories of persons were required to fulfil one common 
qualification i.e. they should be qualified to be a Judge of the High 
Court. Bare reading of aforementioned provision reveals that Section 

 
Writ Petition No.1938 of 2023    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
11 
130(3) of the “Ordinance” does not provide any restrictions or 
conditions relating to character verification during the probationary 
period of Respondent No.5. The provision never transpires any 
condition that mere involvement of a candidate in any criminal 
case/FIR would be sufficient to bring any clog for his appointment as 
a judicial member of ATIR. It is reiterated that the Respondent No.5 
in aforementioned criminal case had never been adjudged as guilty of 
the charges, rather complainant of said case had entered into a 
compromise with him and he was acquitted on basis thereof. 
Furthermore, 
no 
other 
occasion, 
besides 
registration 
of 
aforementioned FIR pertaining to any criminal liability of the 
Respondent No.5 has been brought on record by the Petitioner. 
MOOT POINT NO.3 
Whether the writ of quo warranto is maintainable? 
 
12. 
The writ quo warranto is provided under Article 199 of the 
Constitution and the same is reproduced for ready reference: 
 
ARTICLE 199. Jurisdiction of High Court.  
(1) Subject to the Constitution, a High 
Court may, if it is satisfied that no other 
adequate remedy is provided by law:-  
(a) 
……………..  
(b)  
on the application of any person, make an 
order:-  
(i)       … ………....  
(ii)  requiring a person within the territorial 
jurisdiction of the Court holding or purporting to 
hold a public office to show under what authority 
of law he claims to hold that office; or……….. 
  
13. 
A meticulous study of aforementioned provision and the 
relevant case law on the subject reveals that for the purpose of 
maintaining a writ of quo warranto there is no requirement of an 
aggrieved person, and before a person can claim this relief he must 
satisfy the court, inter alia, that the office in question is a public 
office and is held by a usurper without legal authority. It is a settled 

 
Writ Petition No.1938 of 2023    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12 
law that granting relief in the nature of quo warranto is within the 
discretionary power of the superior courts and this relief cannot be 
allowed as a matter of course, rather the conduct and the bona fides 
of the petitioner, the cause and the object of filing such petition is 
also of considerable importance, which is to be examined. The 
Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in numerous judgments that the 
writ of quo warranto can only be issued in exceptional cases and 
the relief should not be allowed as a matter of course, more so when 
the candidature of a candidate was duly scrutinized at the time of 
the scrutiny of his appointment to ascertain whether he was 
qualified in terms of the Constitution and the law. Accordingly, the 
Court is not required to go into the merits of the case and should 
summarily dismiss the petition on the basis of lack of bona fides 
and extraneous motives of the petitioner and on account of the 
petition being frivolous. Reliance is placed on “JAWAD AHMAD 
MIR versus Prof. DR. IMTIAZ ALI KHAN, VICE CHANCELLOR, 
University of Swabi, District Swabi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and 
others” (2023 SCMR 162),“NISAR KHAN KHATTAK versus HAJI 
ADAM, DIRECTOR GENERAL (Admin), PEMRA Headquarter, 
Mauve Area, Islamabad and another” (2021 PLC (C.S) 140), 
“ATTAULLAH KHAN versus ALI AZAM AFRIDI and others” 
(2023 PLC (C.S) 182) and “MIRZA ABDUL REHMAN versus 
FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN and others” (2017 PLC (C.S) 1327). 
14.  
This Court firmly believes that a writ of “quo warranto” 
should only be issued in exceptional cases and the relief should not 
be allowed in a casual manner, especially when a candidate’s 
qualifications were thoroughly examined during his appointment 
which has never been challenged by the Petitioner. The Court will 
not further discuss s the merits of this case as this petition is liable 
to be dismissed due to Petitioner’s lack of bonafide, extraneous 
motives, and frivolous nature of petition. Further reliance is placed 
on “ABRAR HASSAN versus GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN AND 

 
Writ Petition No.1938 of 2023    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
13 
Respondents” (PLD 1976 Supreme Court 315), wherein it was 
candidly observed that the quo warranto has never been a writ of 
right. The Court may in exercise of its discretion, refuse it, if the 
application is not bona fide or is made for a collateral purpose. 
Similarly, in “ASIF HASSAN and others versus SABIR HUSSAIN 
and others” (2019 SCMR 1720), it was held that a writ in the form 
of quo warranto is an extraordinary discretionary jurisdiction and 
the Court is not bound to exercise such jurisdiction in each and 
every case specially where on account of laches the matter has lost 
its significance. 
MOOT POINT NO.4  
Whether the writ petition is hit by laches? 
15. 
Admittedly, the FIR was registered against the Respondent 
No.5 on 09.08.2005 and he was acquitted from relevant case vide 
order of Judicial Magistrate dated 14.12.2006 which was upheld by 
the Additional Sessions Judge vide order dated 08.03.2008. The 
Respondent No.5 was appointed as Member Judicial, ATIR vide the 
“impugned Notification” dated 26.04.2019 but interestingly instant 
petition has been filed on 01.06.2023 to challenge the same after lapse 
of more than four (04) years without explaining any convincing 
reasonable cause for the inordinate delay. As such principle of laches 
is applicable upon this case as three months’ time is considered 
reasonable for a party to assail an adverse order in writ jurisdiction of 
this Court. The Supreme Court of Pakistan in “STATE BANK OF 
PAKISTAN through Governor and another Versus IMTIAZ ALI 
KHAN and others” (2012 SCMR 280) has held that “laches is a 
doctrine whereunder a party which may have a right, which was 
otherwise enforceable, loses such right to the extent of its enforcement 
if it is found by the Court of a law that its case is hit by the doctrine of 
laches/limitation. Right remains with the party but it cannot enforce 
it. The limitation is examined by the Limitation Act or by special laws 
which have inbuilt provisions for seeking relief against any grievance 

 
Writ Petition No.1938 of 2023    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
14 
within the time specified under the law and if party aggrieved do not 
approach the appropriate forum within the stipulated period/time, the 
grievance though remains but it cannot be redressed because if on 
one hand there was a right with a party which he could have enforced 
against the other but because of principle of limitation/laches, same 
right then vests/accrues in favour of the opposite party”. It was 
further held by Supreme Court of Pakistan in “MEMBER 
(S&R)/CHIEF SETTLEMENT COMMISSIONER, BOARD OF 
REVENUE, 
PUNJAB, 
LAHORE 
and 
another 
Versus 
Syed 
ASHFAQUE ALI and others” (PLD 2003 Supreme Court 132) as 
under: 
“On account of Laches in setting the 
machinery of law into motion they have 
indeed disentitled themselves to the exercise 
of discretionary and equitable jurisdiction, 
which in all cases must be exercised in order 
to foster the ends of justice and to right a 
wrong. Writ jurisdiction is undoubtedly 
discretionary and extraordinary in nature 
which may not be invoked by a party who 
demonstrates a style of slackness and laxity 
on his part. Furthermore, if a party does not 
choose legal remedy available under the 
Statute 
strictly 
speaking 
Constitutional 
jurisdiction of the High Court cannot be 
exercised in his favour. Law is well-settled 
that a patty guilty of gross negligence and 
laches is not entitled to the equitable relief. 
One who seeks equity must show that equities 
lean in his favour. In the facts and 
circumstances of the appeal we are, therefore, 
in no manner of doubt that the High Court 
was not competent to exercise its writ 
jurisdiction conferred under Article 199 of the 
Constitution”.

It is well settled principle that law helps the vigilant and not 
the indolent. Reliance is placed on “AFTAB IQBAL KHAN KHICHI 
and another Versus Messrs UNITED DISTRIBUTORS PAKISTAN 
LTD. KARACHI” (1999 SCMR 1326).

MOOT POINT NO.5 
Whether the office occupied by the respondent a public one, 
and if so, is the respondent occupying this office lawfully? 
 
17. 
The Court will examine the jurisprudence under Article 
199(b)(ii) of the “Constitution” keeping in view two pre-conditions 
for writ of quo warranto (i) holding or purporting to hold a public 
office and (ii) under what authority of law, principles relating 
whereto have been elaborated in “Judicial Review of Public Actions” 
(2018, Pakistan Law House), Second Edition., Vol. 3 Page, 1633 (the 
“Book”) authored by well acclaimed jurist of the country Mr. Justice 
Fazal Karim, Former Judge, Supreme Court of Pakistan. The “Book” 
is used as secondary source as already done by this Court in 
“LAHORE STOCK EXCHANGE versus LAHORE APPELLATE 
BENCH S&EC” (2006 CLD 988) wherein Justice Ali Nawaz 
Chohan (as he then was), relied on treaties by the Harvard Professor 
Louis Loss who in 1969 drafted Securities Ordinance 1969 by 
following the model of Security and Exchange Commission in the 
United States created through the Stock Exchange Act of 1933. 
Whilst discussing holding or purporting to hold a public office, it is 
explained in the “Book” that the public law remedy under Article 
199(1)(b)(ii) is available only against a person holding or purporting 
to hold a public office and not for the holder of a private office. 
Moreover, 
discussing 
the 
word 
‘purporting’ 
envisaged 
in 
aforementioned article, it is detailed that the word ‘purport’ 
according to the dictionary, means ‘be intended to seem’. The 
expression ‘purporting to hold a public office’ may be contrasted 
with the expression ‘officer de facto’ which expression is defined by 
Thomas McIntyre Cooley in his book ‘Constitutional Limitations’, 
Vol. II. p.1355 as ‘one who by some colour of right is in possession 
of an office and for the time being performs its duties with public 
acquiescence, though having no right in fact’, as also with the 
expression ‘intruder’ which is defined in the same book at p.1357 as 

 
Writ Petition No.1938 of 2023    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
16 
‘one who attempts to perform the duties of an office without 
authority of law and without the support of public acquiescence. In 
addition thereto, it is identified therein that the expression ‘public 
office’ is not defined in the 1973 Constitution, however, it was 
defined in the 1962 Constitution to include any office in the Service 
of Pakistan and membership of an assembly. It was further referred 
that Ferris in his “Extraordinary Legal Remedies”, 1926 Edition, 
p.145, explained that “a public office is the right, authority and duty 
created and conferred by law, by which an individual is vested with 
some portion of the sovereign functions of the government to be 
exercised by him for the benefit of the public, for the term and by the 
tenure prescribed by law; it implied a delegation of a portion of the 
sovereign power; it is a trust conferred by the public authority for a 
public purpose, embracing the ideas of tenure, duration, emolument 
and duties, hence, a public officer is thus to be distinguished from a 
mere employment or agency resting on contract, to which such 
powers and functions are not attached. It is further referred by Mr. 
Justice (R) Fazal Karim in the “Book” that aforementioned definition 
of the term “public office” has been adopted by the courts in 
Pakistan 
in 
cases 
“MASUD-UL-HASSAN 
versus 
KHADIM 
HUSSAIN” (PLD 1963 SC 203) in the words that “a public office is 
an office created by the state, by charter or by statue, when the duties 
attached to the office are of a public nature”, which was reiterated in 
“M.A.U.Khan versus M. Sultan” (PLD 1974 SC 228). Mr. Justice 
(R) Fazal Karim in his aforementioned Book, discussed the language 
“under what authority of law” with substance that “We have seen 
that the expression “quo warranto” means “by what authority” or 
“by what warrant”. Sub-Clause (b)(ii) gives effect to the same 
concept by using the phrase “under what authority of law”. The 
word ‘authority’, we have seen, also means jurisdiction, power or 
right. According to Black’s Law Dictionary, “authority” is inter-alia 
permission; right to exercise powers; to implement and enforce laws. 

 
Writ Petition No.1938 of 2023    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
17 
Often synonymous with power; legal power; a right to command or 
to act; the right and power of public officers to require obedience to 
their orders lawfully issued in the scope of their public duties. In the 
context of this sub-clause (b)(ii) the word ‘authority’ means right 
permission or sanction; and the power of the High Courts is to 
require the respondent to show cause what is his legal right, or what 
right in law he has, to hold the office in question. In the words of 
Justice Muhammad Iqbal in “Muhammad Khan versus Lahore 
Cantonment Board” (PLD 1964 Lahore 125) “what is in question is 
the right of the respondent to hold an office of public nature.” 
18. 
The learned counsel for the Petitioner when confronted as to 
whether the post held by Respondent No.5 is a public office as the 
writ of quo-warranto is only maintainable against holder of public 
office, he stated that the term ‘public office’ has not been defined in 
the Constitution of 1973 and the same was defined in the Constitution 
of 1962. He placed his reliance on “MASUDUL HASSAN versus 
KHADIM HUSSAIN and another” (PLD 1963 SC 203), which stated 
that for a writ to be issued the office should be one created by the 
State, by charter or by statute, and that the duty should be of a public 
nature and the respondent should be in possession of the office. 
Moreover, he further argues that the term ‘public officer’ is defined 
under Section 2(17) of Civil Procedure Code as a person falling under 
any of the descriptions given in the said Section, including every 
person in the service of Pakistan.  
19. 
Before judicial adjudication on this moot point it is expedient 
here to explore the term public office. Admittedly, the term “Public 
office” has not been defined in the Constitution, 1973. According to 
the BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY, 9th edition, the public office 
is a position whose occupant has legal authority to exercise a 
government's sovereign powers for a fixed period. According to the   
P RAMANATHA AIYAR’S THE ADVANCED LAW LEXICON, 
4th Edition, the public office is a position whose occupant has legal 

 
Writ Petition No.1938 of 2023    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
18 
authority to exercise a government’s sovereign powers for a fixed 
period. According to the FERRIS’ EXTRAORDINARY LEGAL 
REMEDIES (72 CWN 64, Vol. 72) as referred in “V.C. SHUKLA 
versus STATE” (1980) Supp SCC 249, a public office is the right, 
authority and duty created and conferred by law, by which an 
individual is vested with some portion of the sovereign functions of 
the government to be exercised by him for the benefit of the public, 
for the term and by the tenure prescribed by law. It implies a 
delegation of a portion of the sovereign power.  It is a trust conferred 
by public authority for a public purpose, embracing the ideas of 
tenure, duration, emoluments and duties. The determining factor, the 
test, is whether the office involves a delegation of some of the solemn 
functions of government, executive, legislative or judicial, to be 
exercised by the holder for the public benefit. Aforesaid definition of 
Public office was approved by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
“SALAHUDDIN versus FRONTIER SUGAR MILLS & DISTILLERY 
Ltd” (PLD 1975 Supreme Court 244).  
20. 
The survey of relevant literature and case law on the subject 
reveals that the Respondent No.5 was appointed as a Member Judicial 
ATIR vide impugned notification dated 26.04.2019 by the Federal 
Government after qualifying the Federal Public Service Commission 
Exam. He was appointed u/s 130(3) of the Ordinance read with the 
Appointment of Income Tax Appellate Tribunal Member’s Rules, 
1998.The office of Member Judicial, ATIR is by all intents and a 
purpose is a public office. As this office is created by the State and the 
statute, and the duties attached to the office are of a public nature. 
Reliance is placed on “M.U.A. KHAN versus RANA M. SULTAN and 
another” (PLD 1974 Supreme Court 228). Furthermore, although, 
the term Public Office has not been defined under Article 260 of the 
Constitution, but generally it refers to any person working in the 
Public Sector, whether in Parliamentary, Government or Municipal 
Institutions. The offices created under the Constitution or specific 

 
Writ Petition No.1938 of 2023    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
19 
statutes are deemed to be public offices. Reliance is placed on 
“AKBAR KHAN versus SAID GUL” (PLD 2020 Peshawar 10) & 
“Dr. FARZANA BARI versus MINISTRY OF LAW, JUSTICE AND 
HUMAN RIGHTS” (PLD 2018 Islamabad 127). Undoubtedly, the 
Respondent No.5 was appointed as Member Judicial of ATIR vide the 
“impugned Notification” to hold public office, but it is observed that 
the 
Federal 
Government 
has 
appointed 
Respondent 
No.5  
as a Member Judicial, ATIR after fulfilling all codal formalities and 
keeping in view Section 130(3) of the “Ordinance” prescribing 
eligibility criteria of person to be appointed and the Respondent No.5 
being appointed in due course of law, now is lawfully occupying the 
said public office. Reliance is placed on “MUHAMMAD SHAHID 
AKRAM versus GOVERNMENT OF THE PUNJAB through Chief 
Secretary and 3 others” (2016 PLC (C.S.) 1335). It is pertinent to 
note that the Petitioner has neither challenged the qualifications of the 
Respondent No.5, as mentioned in Section 130 of the “Ordinance” nor 
his experience rather the said Respondent is holding the public office 
strictly as per criteria stipulated in Section 130(3) of the “Ordinance”. 
The said requirement was duly considered by the Federal Government 
at the time of appointment of the Respondent No.5 through 
Notification dated 26.04.2019 followed by memorandum dated 
30.04.2019 which was sent to the Respondent No.5 clearly 
mentioning the terms and conditions mentioned therein.  
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
21. 
The nutshell of the above discussion is that the writ petition 
fails and is accordingly dismissed with no order as to cost.
