Anwaar Hussain, J:-  This petition, under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of 
Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (“the 
Constitution”) is directed against impugned order dated 01.03.2023, 
whereby permission to the petitioners to hold „Aurat march‟, at Nasir 
Bagh, Lahore on 08.03.2023, on the eve of International Women‟s 
Day, has been declined for two-fold reasons. Firstly, that the activities 
involve display of controversial cards and banners for awareness of 
women‟s rights and secondly, Jamaat-e-Islami (Women‟s/Student 
Wings) has also announced a program against the said „Aurat march‟, 
on the same day.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners submit that No Objection 
Certificate (“NOC”) was sought, from respondent No.1, by 

Writ Petition No.15163/2023 
 
2
submitting a proposed program of holding a lawful and peaceful 
march and refusal of such permission on the reasons and grounds 
recorded in the impugned order are not sustainable in terms of the 
constitutional guarantees in general and the right to hold a peaceful 
assembly in particular. Add that the jurisprudence developed on the 
legal point involved encourages such march that creates awareness in 
public about women‟s rights and place reliance on cases reported as 
“Imran Javed Aziz and others v. Federation of Pakistan through 
Secretary, Ministry of Interior and others” (PLD 2020 Islamabad 
302), “Allah Rakha Mehmood Mughal alias A.R. Mehmood Mughal v. 
Government of Punjab and others” (PLD 2020 Lahore 515) and 
“Munir Ahmad v. Federation of Pakistan and others” (PLD 2020 
Lahore 528).  
3. 
Conversely, learned Law Officer along with Rafia Haider, 
Deputy Commissioner, Lahore as well as Sarfraz Virk, S.P Civil 
Lines, Lahore are in attendance and submit that there were two 
applications for grant of NOC to hold a march/assembly at Nasir 
Bagh; one by the petitioners, which was filed on 10.02.2023 and the 
second was filed on 28.02.2023 by Jamaat-e-Islami. However, first 
meeting of the District Intelligence Committee (“DIC”) was held 
wherein it was apprehended that possibility of law and order situation 
may arise as a result of potential conflict between the two groups, 
hence, the NOC was refused to the petitioners through the impugned 
order and in the second meeting of the DIC, the NOC was also refused 
to the other group and at present, nobody is allowed to hold the 
assembly at Nasir Bagh. Add that there has been third DIC meeting as 
well on the strength of which it was concluded that it will be against 
the public interest to allow such permission to either of the parties. 
Further add that historically, it is Jamaat-e-Islami who has been 
allowed to have an assembly at Nasir Bagh in preference to the other 
groups, therefore, the permission could not be given to the petitioners. 
When confronted with, learned counsel for the petitioners submit that 

Writ Petition No.15163/2023 
 
3
the entire process through which the intelligence reports are 
prepared/gathered is non-transparent as the petitioners are not 
properly associated with any such assessment of threat. Further 
contend that assigning proposed venue to Jamaat-e-Islami on the 
basis of any conventional/historical association with the said venue is 
also without any lawful basis.  
4. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
5. 
The core issue that requires determination by this Court is to 
examine whether the reasons given in the impugned order for refusal 
to grant permission to hold the proposed march at Nasir Bagh, Lahore 
are sustainable inasmuch as it is mere apprehension on part of the 
respondents that the said permission would trigger law and order 
situation as another stake holder (Jamaat-e-Islami) has also 
announced a counter march on the same date and at the same place 
although it is admitted position that the application for the permission 
filed by Jammat-e-Islami was later in time, and the same has been 
also declined.  
6. 
Before rendering the opinion, it is in fitness of things to analyze 
the importance of the day i.e., 8th March. In 1975, United Nations 
declared 8th March as an official/formal International Women‟s Day, 
which aims to help nations eradicate discrimination, and also confer 
social, political, economic, cultural as well as equal protection of law 
to the women folk. Pakistan is a signatory to „Conventions on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women‟ (“the 
CEDAW”) which was adopted in the year 1979 by United Nations 
General Assembly. Under the CEDAW, like other signatories, 
Pakistan is obligated to encourage parity and eliminate inequality 
between women and men in all walks of life. It is pertinent to point 
out that the Constitution, through its preamble, spells out the 
collective will of the people of Pakistan as to how the people wanted 

Writ Petition No.15163/2023 
 
4
them to be ruled by their chosen representatives. The preamble of the 
Constitution provides as under: 
“Wherein the principles of democracy, freedom, 
equality, tolerance and social justice, as enunciated 
by Islam, shall be fully observed;”  
 
The above-quoted excerpt from the preamble of the Constitution 
clinches the umbral core of the polity of the State. In fact, the 
principles of freedom, equality, tolerance and social justice form the 
very fabric of constitutional democracy. Tolerance with the way of 
life that may not be agreeable to one‟s viewpoint not only makes the 
co-habitation of conflicting and/or not-so-agreeable viewpoints 
possible but also is essential to trigger and generate the social 
engagement and discussion in the society which is essential and 
fundamental for social and political evolution of any society. 
Similarly, Article 16 of the Constitution provides freedom of 
assembly to the citizens of Pakistan albeit subject to any reasonable 
restrictions imposed by law, in the interest of public order. Article 16 
is reproduced hereunder:  
“16. 
Freedom of assembly. Every citizen 
shall have the right to assemble peacefully and 
without 
arms, 
subject 
to 
any 
reasonable 
restrictions imposed by law in the interest of 
public order.” 
 
Bare perusal of the above quoted provision brings forth that right to 
assemble is fundamental right of citizens of Pakistan, which is subject 
to reasonable restrictions imposed by law, in public interest.  
7. 
As regards the rights of the women folk of the society, no 
religion has empowered the women as Islam which can be gauged 
from the fact that Islam at its very advent, granted rights to them 
which could not have been even imagined in the Arabian Peninsula at 
that time. Islam has forbidden oppression in general and oppression of 
the woman, orphans and destitute in particular. Islam has also not 
allowed any one to bully, harass, subdue or persecute any person in 

Writ Petition No.15163/2023 
 
5
the world and precisely for this reason, many of the verses of the 
glorious Quran relate to the prohibition of oppression (dhulm) in any 
form, whether it is social, political, economic, or in any other guise. 
Islam came to end oppression. To restore equality and justice to the 
community, Allah Almighty revealed surah Nisa and surah Talaq 
focusing on women‟s issues. Islam came to liberate women from 
oppression and gave multiple rights to them including the right to be 
financially independent; to trade and earn; to have their own property 
independent from their husbands; entitled to a mahr upon marriage 
and have their prescribed share in inheritance and in this manner 
granted legal personhood to women.  
8. 
Similarly, the Constitution contains a long list of fundamental 
rights applicable equally to men and women but some are designed 
specifically to protect women‟s rights. Article 32 of the Constitution 
makes special provisions for the representation of women in local 
Government whereas Article 34 thereof directs the state to take 
appropriate measures to enable women to participate in all spheres of 
life and social activities. Moreover, the women make up more than 50 
percent of our demographic mix and their contribution to the socio-
economic life as mainstream citizens is essential and fundamental for 
socio-economic advancement. More often than not, it is not only 
awareness spreading campaign but also an attempt to wriggle out of 
certain socio-political perceptions that civil society take up the 
gauntlet to break open those perceptions by rallying the public voice 
against those perceptions. This certainly gives birth to socio-political 
friction in the society particularly between and/or among rival 
perceptions and social convictions. This social friction lies at the heart 
of evolution of human civilization and of every society in the absence 
of which the society becomes rotten and rusty in terms of socio-
political advancement as forces of friction are not even allowed to 
straighten out and iron out their differences in the society. Similarly, 
there is no doubt that women rights and awareness about their rights is 

Writ Petition No.15163/2023 
 
6
considered essential for women to make positive contributions to 
socio-economic and political advancement of our society. The modus 
operandi of one group to raise such awareness could be objectionable 
for the other and vice versa. However, it has to be our social and 
national consensus that women are to be assimilated into mainstream 
socio-economic and political life. 
9. 
Having above referred constitutional and legal position in sight, 
needless to mention that both, organizers of the Aurat march and the 
Jamaat-e-Islami, are part of our society and aim at raising awareness 
among women folks of the society, albeit in accordance with their 
own perspective. It is the society which should be left to be its own 
judge instead of smothering a particular voice. To borrow Hegelian 
philosophy, it is the thesis interacting with antithesis which leads to 
synthesis. Hence, if no antithesis is even allowed to come out, social 
synthesis would remain an elusive dream. Hence, societal engagement 
must be encouraged. Similarly, the friction, if any, underlying the 
„Aurat march” and counter march by an established religious political 
party, at national level, is a form of social and societal engagement 
and it is their engagement at societal level which can smoothen out the 
engagement rather than smothering one approach which would always 
keep the forces of friction working or remaining latent in the society 
without provision of any out-let to those forces of friction. Nothing 
can be more fatal socially to a society than such forces of friction 
having no vent out. Therefore, it is observed that one has to respect 
both approaches and neither the proponent of the Aurat march nor the 
stakeholders who have made an announcement, as per the impugned 
order, to hold parallel march, have right to act against the law and 
indulge into confrontation and violence. Thus, while the right to 
assemble is a constitutionally guaranteed right, the same has to be 
exercised in a manner that it does not undermine the public order. The 
petitioners, therefore, are obligated to exercise this right through the 
prism of public order. Hence, slogans at a peaceful protest can always 

Writ Petition No.15163/2023 
 
7
be better worded to avoid provocation, hate or outrage. During the 
course of arguments, the petitioners present in person along with their 
counsel submit that they do realize the same and have assured that the 
proposed Aurat march will be conducted in consistency with the 
norms of decency and parameters prescribed by the law as the 
proponents of the Aurat march are also well aware of Article 2 of the 
Constitution, which contemplates that Islam is to be the state religion 
as well as Article 2-A thereof that makes Quran and Sunnah as the 
supreme law of the country. Therefore, like other citizens of Pakistan, 
the organizers and participants of Aurat march as well as the other 
stake holders must work towards a more tolerant and democratic 
society and it is here where the duty of the government lies to ensure 
adequate and fool-proof security arrangements to the participants of a 
peaceful demonstration/march; be that of the petitioner or the 
Jammat-e-Islami (Women Wing/Student Wing). 
10. 
On a pointed question to the Deputy Commissioner, Lahore as 
to whether mere fact that one group has announced its “gathering” or 
“march” with conflicting views can be made basis of refusal to the 
other group to stage their procession or rally, she could not come up 
with a plausible answer. There is no doubt that the executive limb of 
the state is obligated to ensure maintenance of the law and order in the 
province/country and is the best judge to regulate a gathering and/or 
procession but the same has to be measured in proportionate relation 
to the fundamental rights of the citizens to assemble and there should 
not be any discrimination while granting or refusing such NOC. It 
cannot be countenanced that a perceived and/or apprehended conflict 
between the two groups could be made an excuse to completely refuse 
the right to assemble to both the groups. This would amount to either 
abdication of the executive functions by the state machinery to 
provide security to its citizens or failure and disability of the executive 
to manage the issue, in a fair and non-discriminatory manner. Instead 
of absolute refusal of permission to the petitioners, the same could 

Writ Petition No.15163/2023 
 
8
have been managed by engaging both the groups and by getting 
undertaking from them that no one would resort to violent acts and/or 
confine themselves or their acts to exercise of their rights guaranteed 
under the Constitution in a manner which are not provocative or 
socially obscene. This is where the managerial skills of executive 
could have been brought to use, to ensure efficient and 
constitutionally-compliant management of the event/issue, which 
seems to have been abdicated that triggered the filing of the present 
petition.  
11. 
In view of the above discussion, this Court is of considered 
opinion that restrictions on the right to assemble can be imposed 
under the law which ought to be based upon public interest. In the 
instant case, the absolute restrictions/ban imposed on the “Aurat 
march” is not tenable inasmuch as the reasons put forth by 
Respondent No.1 for the refusal of permission to hold Aurat march 
are not only implausible but also against the spirit of Article 16 of the 
Constitution. Ironically, not only the petitioners have been refused 
NOC to hold “Aurat march”, Jammat-e-Islami has also been refused 
any such NOC. This belies logic as both the groups/segments of the 
society have been refused NOC and denied right to assemble on the 
perceived and apprehended perception and threats that is against the 
constitutional dictates. Therefore, the impugned order cannot sustain 
and is, thus  set aside.  
12. 
However, while right of peaceful assembly is the guarantee 
conferred by the Constitution, the power to regulate the same, in the 
interest of public at large, through reasonable restrictions under the 
law has also been vested in the executive. During the course of 
arguments, learned counsel for the petitioners also could not refute 
that the respondents have the power to regulate the right of the 
petitioners to assemble, keeping in view the public safety and law and 
order situation and sought time to chalk out a mutually agreeable 
route for the proposed Aurat march and during the latter half of the 

Writ Petition No.15163/2023

Court‟s hours when the matter was taken up again for hearing, the 
parties have come with a consensus that the proposed Aurat march 
will start from NADRA Office, Shimla Hill/Egerton Road, Lahore 
and will end at Flatties Chowk, Lahore and the proceedings would 
be concluded between 02:00 p.m. to 06:00 p.m., on 08.03.2023.  For 
this purpose, the terms have been settled and submitted in the Court, 
which are being made part of this order and read as under:
