(JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT) 
 
Criminal Revision No.200 of 2023. 
 
Sabir Hussain 
 
versus  
The State, etc. 
 
JUDGMENT 
Date of hearing: 
 
13.12.2023 
Petitioner by: 
 
Malik Saeed Ejaz, Advocate. 
State by: 
 
Mr. Shahid Fareed, Assistant 
District Public Prosecutor. 
 
Respondent/complainant by: 
Mr. Shabbir Masood Malik, 
Advocate. 
 
  
MUHAMMAD AMJAD RAFIQ, J:- Through this 
criminal revision, order dated 08.11.2023 was assailed by the 
petitioner whereby the learned Additional Sessions Judge, 
Ahmadpur East has declined his request for providing him with copy 
of CDR comprising of 117 pages mentioned in the recovery memo 
dated 30.11.2020 though was not available on the record. The 
learned Judge directed that CDR was collected by one Dilawar 
Hussain SI/I.O. who has yet not been examined as witness in the 
case, therefore, on his appearance in the dock, the petitioner can well 
examine the data of CDR if produced in evidence. 
2.  
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that law permits 
for provision of relevant documents to the defence upon which the 
prosecution case is structured or is expected to be relied upon during 
trial, and in this respect, he developed an argument that it is not 
necessary that any document disclosure of which is regulated u/s 
265-C of Cr.P.C. cannot be summoned before or after that stage. He 
has referred case reported as “The STATE versus Chaudhry 
MUHAMMAD USMAN” (2023 SCMR 1676) wherein while 

Crl. Rev. No.200 of 2023                       2 
referring section 94 of Cr.P.C., the Supreme Court of Pakistan has 
held that Court can summon any document at any stage of inquiry or 
trial for its supply to the accused if requested for and is essential for 
his defence on any fact in issue in the case. Learned counsel further 
submits that when disclosure stage under section 265-C of Cr.P.C., 
is passed and prosecution wants to use any witness who is not cited 
in the list, accused still had a chance to get copies of statement of a 
witness or related document as per mandate of section 162 of 
Cr.P.C. 
3.  
Learned Assistant District Public Prosecutor on the other 
hand has conceded the legal position as referred in case reported as 
“The STATE versus Chaudhry MUHAMMAD USMAN” (2023 
SCMR 1676). Though learned counsel for the respondent/ 
complainant has opposed the petition but later conceded that by 
providing copy of CDR to the accused/petitioner, prosecution case 
wound not be affected in any manner. 
4.  
Heard. Record perused. 
5.  
The Supreme Court of Pakistan while dilating upon section 
94 of Cr.P.C. has categorically interpreted that the trial Court can 
summon any document which is essential for the purpose of an 
inquiry or trial and this can also be done on the application of any 
party. In this case, CDR of accused persons was collected by 
Dilawar Hussain SI/I.O. through recovery memo dated 30.11.2020 
available in the police but such CDR and a recovery memo were not 
appended with the report under section 173 of Cr.P.C. It is expected 
that this evidence would be used against the accused if unfavourable 
to him; therefore, he cannot be embarrassed with surprise evidence 
without giving him time and opportunity to prepare his defence on 
this evidence. Due process as guaranteed under Article 10-A of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 requires that 
all the processes supplemented by the legal provisions must be 
followed by providing a fair opportunity to the accused. 
6.          It has further been noticed that once a party calls a document 
after giving notice to the other for its production which is in the 

Crl. Rev. No.200 of 2023                       3 
possession of other party and if such party refuses to produce the 
same, then document cannot be used as evidence later in the process 
except with the consent of party or the Court, and notice to other 
party of course can be a situation when an application before the 
Court is filed for summoning of such document. Article 159 & 160 
of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 are referred in this respect as 
under: 
 
159. Giving, as evidence, of document called for and produced on 
notice: When a party calls for a document which he has given the other 
party notice to produce, and such document is produced and inspected by 
the party calling for its production, he is bound to give it as evidence if the 
party producing it requires him to do so. 
 
160. Using, as evidence, of document production of which was refused 
on notice: When a party refuses to produce a document which he has had 
notice to produce, he cannot afterwards use the document as evidence 
without the consent of the other party or the order of the Court. 
 
The Article 159 above connotes the benefits and fatalities of 
summoning of document for production in the evidence. In this case 
if CDR is unfavourable to the accused, then he cannot opt to skip its 
production before the Court, if prosecution demands. Whereas 
Article 160 above clearly speaks that if the prosecution shall not 
produce CDR before the Court on the notice of accused, then it 
cannot use such CDR as evidence during the trial except with the 
consent of accused or the Court. Thus, right of the accused for 
seeking the data of CDR should not be infringed otherwise this 
evidence could also not been used by the prosecution during the 
trial. Another situation can also be materialized in the circumstances 
that if on notice prosecution does not produce the CDR, then 
accused shall be at liberty to produce secondary evidence of such 
CDR as mandated through Article 76 & 77 of the Qanun-a-Shahadat 
Order, 1984 and in this respect he can seek the help of Court under 
section 265-F(7) of Cr.P.C. at later stage. 
7.        There is no cavil to the proposition that for taking a 
prosecutorial decision, police collect material pro and contra of the 
allegations; some material is used considering it in line with 

Crl. Rev. No.200 of 2023                       4 
prosecution story and rest is abandoned as irrelevant or in conflict of 
interest, such material is called unused material. In our law, 
disclosure of material to the accused under section 241-A or 265-C 
of Cr.P.C. is limited to one which is being used by the prosecution, 
but in foreign jurisdictions accused always had a chance to see or 
seek any unused material to build his defence or to contradict the 
prosecution case. Now Supreme Court of Pakistan in case cited 
supra has widened the scope of material to be provided to the 
accused if it is essential to adhere to fundamental right of due 
process and fair trial. The only exception to this material would the 
‘Diary of proceedings in investigation’ which is privileged under 
section 172 of Cr.P.C. as held by Supreme Court of Pakistan in case 
reported as “MUHAMMAD IDREES and another versus The STATE 
and others” (2021 SCMR 612). 
8.     For what has been discussed above, the accused/petitioner is 
entitled to have copy of requisite CDR and recovery memo well in 
time before the appearance of Dilawar Hussain SI/I.O. in the dock. 
Consequently, this revision petition is allowed in the above terms.
