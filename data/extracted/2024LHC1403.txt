                It is also pertinent to mention here that said petitions were fixed for 
hearing on 28.03.2024. On that day, it was apprised to the Court that there is a 
written request for adjournment on behalf of petitioner’s counsel (Mr. Abdul 
Mughni Farani, Advocate). Said request was vehemently opposed from 
respondents’ side. Hence, while hearing arguments from respondents’ side, 
cases were reserved for announcement of judgment.  
    On 29.03.2024 learned counsel for the petitioners appeared in the Court 
and verbally requested that he be given an opportunity to argue his cases. In the 
interest of justice, opportunity of hearing is granted to the learned counsel for 
the petitioners on 30.03.2024. Learned counsel for the respondents present in the 
Court also avail right of rebuttal.  
2. 
Through this Constitution Petition filed under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the petitioners have assailed 
the vires of the notification No.SRO-436(I)2006 dated 10.05.2006 issued by 
respondent No.1 (Govt. of Pakistan through its States and Frontier Regions 
Division Secretary, Islamabad), whereby specific Wandas regarding the property 
of late Ameer of Bahawalpur Sir Sadiq Muhammad Khan Abbasi were made in 
favour of his twenty three legal heirs on the recommendation of implementation 
committee and prayed as under: 
             It is therefore most respectfully prayed that :- 
 
(a) Allowing the writ petition the notification No. No.SRO 436(I)2006 
issued by the respondent No.1 Govt. of Pakistan may very 
graciously be declared as illegal, ultra vires, without lawful 
authority and nullity in the eye of law.  
 
(b) The respondents No.1 to 6 may please be orders to maintain joint 
Wandas in the Shikargah and in the alternative to reconstitute all 
the Wandas justly, equitably and fairly in accordance with law.  
 
 

Writ Petition No.2916 of 2006. 
Writ Petition No.7305 of 2019.

(c) That Implementation Committee may please be directed to strictly 
comply the report of Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor-ul-Salam in the 
light of judgments of apex Court.  
 
(d) Such other orders may please be passed as are just and beneficial 
to the petitioners.”  
 
             Whereas, in the second Writ Petition (7305 of 2019/BWP) petitioners of 
said Writ Petition prayed as under: 
“It is therefore, most humbly prayed that by accepting instant constitutional 
petition, the impugned notification SRO. No.436(I)2006 issued by the 
respondent No.1 is against the judgment dated 02.10.2018 passed by the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan and also against the judgment reported 
as PLJ 2002 Supreme Court 210 and also against the summary of worthy 
Prime Minister of Pakistan dated 20.11.2018 may kindly be set aside and 
declared as illegal, void, without lawful authority and is not sustainable in the 
eyes of law and is liable to be set aside and a direction may kindly be issued 
to the respondents that they should remain and abstain from distributing the 
resumed land of Shikargah measuring 277947 acres situated in Cholistan, 
Tehsil Yazman District Bahawalpur amongst the legal heirs of his Highness 
Ameer of Bahawalpur in the interest of justice. Any other appropriate relief, 
which this Hon’ble Court deem fit and proper in the circumstances of the case 
may also be awarded.” 
 
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners while reiterating the facts and grounds 
as pleaded in the Writ Petitions, prayed for acceptance of the Writ Petitions.  
4. 
Contrarily, the respondents vehemently opposed the contentions of 
learned counsel for the petitioners by maintaining that petitioners should have 
approached the Federal Government for redressal of their grievance and prayed 
for dismissal of the writ petitions.  
5. 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties at full length and perused the 
record with their able assistance.  
6. 
Before discussing further, it is better to see the background of the 
controversy. In 1947 through an Act of the British Parliament known as Indian 
Independence Act, 1947, the British Crown gave up its sovereignty in respect of 
various provinces of Sub-Continent known as British India and divided those 
into two dominions i.e. one of India and other of Pakistan. It also lacks its 
suzerainty in respect of the States in the Sub-Continent with which it had special 

Writ Petition No.2916 of 2006. 
Writ Petition No.7305 of 2019.  
-4-
relationship under treaties or agreements about foreign affairs, defence, etc. and 
who had otherwise remained to rule as before the advent of the British in the 
Sub-Continent. Henceforth, the States were to conduct their own affairs.  
7. 
The State of Bahawalpur was ruled by His Highness Alhaj Sir Sadiq 
Muhammad Khan Abbasi. On 03.10.1947, the Ruler of Bahawalpur State 
through an instrument of accession acceded to Pakistan, which was accepted by 
the then Governor General. Supplementary instruments of accession were also 
executed between the Ruler of Bahawalpur and the Governor General. Before 
the formation of one unit in the western wing an agreement was executed on 
17.12.1954 between the Ameer of Bahawalpur and the Government of Pakistan, 
by which Bahawalpur State reiterated its accessions to Pakistan and agreed to 
merge in West Pakistan.  
8. 
   In respect of the States in accession with Pakistan, on the 21st of August, 
1961 the President of Pakistan, in pursuance of the proclamation of Martial Law, 
promulgated the President’s Order No.12 of 1961 called the Acceding State 
(Properties) Order, 1961, (hereinafter referred to as Order, 1961).   
9. 
 On 24th May, 1966 his Highness Alhaj Sir Sadiq Muhammad Khan 
Abbasi, the Ruler of Bahawalpur State passed away. Some of the heirs of the 
late Ruler filed an application under Article 03 of the Order, 1961. The President 
appointed a Commission in 1967 to make an inquiry into the properties and their 
distribution etc. The commission headed by Mr. Abu Nasar submitted its report 
on 26.01.1968, whereby, detailed the properties both in Pakistan and abroad, i.e. 
United Kingdom and India, determined 24 heirs; 04 widows, 10 sons and 10 
daughters, validated “Farmans” and dealt with the application of the Land 
Reforms Regulations. About properties in United Kingdom, on the basis of the 

Writ Petition No.2916 of 2006. 
Writ Petition No.7305 of 2019.  
-5-
“Will” of the late Ameer of Bahawalpur and her renunciation of any claim to the 
property in Pakistan, those were left with the Doweger Her Highness O.J. 
Abbasi. So far as property in India, compensation under the law was paid to the 
late Ameer in his life time. For the properties in Pakistan, excluding the 
Doweger Her Highness O.J. Abbasi, the remaining heirs were found to be 23: 03 
widows, 10 sons and 10 daughters. The shares were found to be 1/8th for 03 
widows, remaining 7/8th for the 10 sons and 10 daughters in the ratio of 2:1. The 
properties in the Pakistan were divided in two categories. One was given to the 
succeeding Nawab and the other was distributed amongst all the heirs of the late 
Ameer. In the light of said report, the President promulgated Devolution and 
Distribution of Property (Ameer of Bahawalpur) Order, 1969, on 19th February, 
1969 which was published in Gazette of Pakistan (extraordinary) on 20.02.1969.  
10. 
       Said order of 1969 was assailed by succeeding Ameer through Writ 
Petition before this Court by relying on instruments of accession, merger 
agreement, rule of custom i.e. primogeniture claiming that he was entitled to the 
entire estate included the ones distributed amongst all the heirs of the late Ameer 
in the schedule II. A learned Division Bench of this Court which was seized of 
the matter partly allowed the petition by declaring that the devolution order had 
not been passed by the Government of Pakistan in accordance with law and, 
therefore, it was of no legal effect. The case was, however, remitted to the 
Central Government for fresh disposal of the dispute before it, in accordance 
with law. The judgment was reported as “Brig. His Highness Nawab 
Muhammad Abbas Khan Abbasi, Ameer of Bahawalpur. V. Government of 
Pakistan, through the Joint Secretary, Ministry of States and Frontier Regions, 
Rawalpindi and 23 others” (PLD 1978 Lahore 1166). Said judgment was 

Writ Petition No.2916 of 2006. 
Writ Petition No.7305 of 2019.  
-6-
challenged by the Government of Pakistan as well as by the Nawab Brig. His 
Highness Muhammad Abbas Khan Abbasi through Civil Appeals. The august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan while dismissing these appeals, observed that Nawab 
Muhammad Abbas Khan Abbasi was not entitled to claim the properties left 
behind by the late Ameer on the rule of primogeniture. It was further observed 
that the entire estate of the late Ameer is to be distributed amongst all the legal 
heirs in accordance with the rule of Muslim Law. Said decision is reported in 
“Govt. of Pakistan V. Brig. His Highness Nawab Muhammad Abbas Khan 
Abbasi and others” (PLD 1982 SC 367). Against the said judgment a review 
petition was filed which was dismissed with certain observations on 27.11.1983 
that the matter of distribution/devolution required determination of intricate 
factual controversies among the legal heirs of the late Ameer of Bahawalpur 
which was the exclusive function of the Central Government to determine. Said 
judgment is reported as “Brig. H.H. Nawab Muhammad Abbas Khan Abbasi, 
Ameer of Bahawalpur V. Govt. of Pakistan and others” (PLD 1984 SC 67).  
11. 
        In the light of said decisions of Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, 
Commission was appointed by the Central Government for distribution of the 
estate of the late Ameer amongst the legal heirs. Recommendations were made. 
For further action, another Committee was constituted. The Committee prepared 
a report but it was not signed. Another Committee was constituted, who 
recommended an interim package about urban properties. This interim package 
was challenged through Constitutional Petitions which were dismissed on 
03.07.1997. The matter again went before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan. The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in its judgment “Prince A. M. 

Writ Petition No.2916 of 2006. 
Writ Petition No.7305 of 2019.  
-7-
Abbasi and another V. Federal Government through Secretary and 24 others” 
(PLD 2002 Supreme Court 170), observed as under: 
“In view of what has been discussed above, we hold that in the circumstances 
of the case, the interim package announced by the Inquiry Commission does 
not meet the ends of justice and is also not in accordance with the direction of 
this Court contained in various pronouncements with regard thereto in general 
and two cases: one filed by the Government of Pakistan PLD 1982 SC 367 
(supra) and secondly by Brig. H. H. Nawab Muhammad Abbas Khan Abbasi 
(supra) PLD 1984 SC 67 in particular. 
16. 
The perusal of these judgments and the record, thus warrants that the 
controversy shall have to be resolved afresh in accordance with the direction 
contained in the case of Government of Pakistan    PLD 1982 SC 367 (supra) 
and the observation made subsequently in review petition in “Brig. H. H. 
Nawab Muhammad Abbas Khan Abbasi (supra) by this Court.” 
 
It was further held that:  
“We are, therefore, of the considered view that in the interest of justice, equity 
`and fair play and in order to render adjudication of the controversy once for 
all, the committee to be constituted by the Federal Government for making 
recommendation shall be headed by a learned Retired Judge of this Court.” 
 
It was concluded that:  
“Now the stage is set for considering out of the available retired Judges of this 
Court, the name of the learned Retired Judge to head the committee. After due 
consideration, we agreed on the name of Justice (R) Abdul Shakoor-ul-Salam 
residing at Lahore these days to head the committee for ascertaining the 
properties left by the late Ameer of Bahawalpur, the extent of the shares of 
various claimants therein and to suggest the mode of the distribution of the 
properties amongst the claimants/heirs, in the light of the two judgments 
rendered by this Court in (i) Government of Pakistan V. His Highness Nawab 
Muhammad Abbas Khan Abbasi and others” PLD 1982 SC 367 and (ii) Brig. 
H. H. Nawab Muhammad Abbas Khan Abbasi and others V. Govt. of Pakistan 
and others” PLD 1984 SC 67 and make recommendations to the Federal 
Government of Islamic Republic of Pakistan accordingly. ” 
 
 
12. 
In pursuance of said order of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the Federal 
Government constituted a Committee under the Chairmanship of Justice (R) 
Abdul Shakoor-ul-Salam through SRO-140(1)/2002 on 07.03.2002 with the 
following terms of reference, namely: 
“a)   
 To ascertain the properties left by the Late Ameer of  
Bahawalpur.  
b) 
To determine the shares of various claimants in the properties left by the 
late Ameer of Bahawalpur. 
 
c) 
To suggest the mode of the distribution of the properties amongst the 
claimants/heirs in the light of the two judgments rendered by the 

Writ Petition No.2916 of 2006. 
Writ Petition No.7305 of 2019.  
-8-
Supreme Court i. Govt. of Pakistan V. His Highness Muhammad Abbas 
Abbasi and others” (PLD 1982 SC 367) and ii. Brig. H. H. Nawab 
Muhammad Abbas Khan Abbasi and others V. Govt. of Pakistan, etc. 
(PLD 1984 SC 67) and;  
 
d)      To make recommendation to the Federal Government of Islamic Republic 
of Pakistan accordingly. The Committee, in discharge of its function, may 
also deal with those who have encroached upon or disposed of the 
property of Late Ameer unauthorizedly or who are getting income from 
such a property illegally; and hear any or all legal heirs or their 
counsel. ” 
 
In the light of said terms of reference the Committee concluded as under:  
“1.  
Properties left by the late Ameer subject matter of the Supreme 
Court judgments are those mentioned in Mr. Abu Nasir’s report and in 
the first and the second schedule of the Devolution and Distribution 
Order, 1969.  
2. 
The share are: 03 widows 1/8, the rest 7/8 amongst 10 sons and 10 
daughters in the ratio of 2:1.  
3. 
Mode of devolution in view of the two judgments dealt with in the 
main report.  
 
4. 
Other matter about encroachers and disposal unauthorizedly 
relating to third parties, normal law of the land would take care. 
No benefit can accrue by grouping in the dark. 
  
5. 
However, it has come to notice that some heirs had usufruct of 
agriculture land in their possession, while others did not have any 
land in their possession. The total Revenue Authorities may be 
directed to investigate and estimate the loss to those deprived of 
their due, and the Federal Government from the compensation of 
the resumed land, make necessary adjustments.”  
 
And made following recommendations: 
“36 years have gone by. May heirs even their heirs has died in the 
meanwhile. Sharia law is being applied for the distribution of the 
inheritance. So, it is not only an official responsibility but an Islamic 
duty to finalize the matter as soon as possible. Therefore, it is 
recommended that action may taken step by step.  
 
The shares of the heirs are undisputed and these are 03 widows 1/8th, the 
balance 7/8th amongst the 10 sons and 10 daughters in the ratio of 2:1.  
 
First action should be taken under the Land Reforms Regulation in the 
light of the report of the Commission headed by Mr. Abu Nasir who was 
Chief Land Commissioner himself, had consulted the Land Reforms 
Commission and the report had been accepted by the President of 
Pakistan. He had noticed that most of the heirs, expecting 2 or 3 have 
already got ceiling limits. They be given choice as earlier decided. Other 
2 or 3 be given land of their choice upto the ceiling. Rest of the land 
resumed and compensation paid. It had earlier been noted that revenue 
authorities had assured that the whole job can be done in 02 months. Let 
it be done now.  

Writ Petition No.2916 of 2006. 
Writ Petition No.7305 of 2019.  
-9-
Secondly, the properties of the late Ameer should be distributed and 
dealt with as in para 21 and 22 above straightaway. Wherever, action is 
to take place, that should simultaneously be held  within 2 or 3 months.  
 
Thirdly, after keeping sufficient amount for administrative purposes and 
discharge of other liabilities of the late Ameer, the rest of his money in 
the hands of the State should be disbursed immediately amongst the 
heirs according to their Sharia share described above. We were told that 
some are in dire need.  
If some omission occurs or error creeps in or there is something amiss, 
that may be looked after later but the major steps mentioned above 
should not be postponed, otherwise controversy or even litigation will go 
on without any benefit to anybody and loss to all including the State”. 
 
13. 
The Committee also answered the objections of the parties who claimed 
to purchase the property of late Ameer of Bahawalpur from the co-sharers, on 
stamp paper. They prayed that the property purchased by them should be 
included in the respective shares of the heirs so that they do not face any 
difficulties afterwards in getting the same mutated in their favour. These 
properties were allegedly under agreements from the heirs or successors-in-
interest. Title the specific properties did not vest in the sellers at the relevant 
time. The committee observed that the law (Art.3 of P.O.12 of 1961) in 
pursuance of which the committee is functioning, deals in question between 
persons claiming to be the heirs or successors to the property of late Ameer and 
not between the heirs or successors and third parties and disposed of their 
objections in the following terms: - 
“The purchasers may approach the relevant authorities like Land Reforms 
Authorities for relief and if their agreements are genuine, possession 
obtained in lieu thereof, the Authorities may accommodate them in 
accordance with law or they may approach the Courts of law for such 
relief on proof of their claim as may be available to them in accordance 
with law like following the property in the hands of their sellers or 
damages. The law (Article 3 of P.O.12 of 1961) in pursuance of which this 
Committee is functioning deals with questions between persons claiming to 
be the heirs of successors to the property of late Ameer and not between 
the heirs on successors and thirds’ parties. The relationship or transaction 
between then is governed by the Ordinary Law.” 
 
 Some persons have filed applications that they had been given land by 
the late Ameer on simple “Farman’s” and they have possession against the 

Writ Petition No.2916 of 2006. 
Writ Petition No.7305 of 2019.  
-10-
claimed land, but it was not mutated in the revenue record in his life time due to 
certain reasons. Therefore, the lands be devolved from the properties of the late 
Ameer. Committee observed that such property cannot be taken out from the 
devolution and distribution as there are no proofs in support of such contention. 
    Certain persons had submitted the copies of consent decrees issued by 
the Civil Courts against their claims and prayed that these decrees may be 
implemented in the revenue record. The committee decided not to interfere at 
this stage and those persons may approach the respective authorities to 
implement these decrees of Civil Court. 
14. 
     Through SRO-252(I)/2003 dated 07.03.2003 the Federal Government 
considered the recommendations of the Committee and made certain 
amendments in the paragraphs Nos.2, 3, 5, 1st schedule and added para Nos.3-a 
and the 3rd schedule in the Devolution and Distribution of the Property (Ameer 
of Bahawalpur) Order, 1969.  
15. 
    Through notification SRO-321(I)/2003 dated 26.03.2003 the Prime 
Minister approved the recommendations of the Committee and constituted an 
Implementation Committee headed by Justice (R) Abdul Shakoor-ul-Salam and 
directed the Committee to take action step-by-step as under: - 
“a.   Distribute all income in the hands of the state received from the 
production of properties of the late of Ameer of Bahawalpur 
amongst twenty-three legal heirs according to Shariah shares after 
keeping sufficient amount for administrative purposes and 
discharge of other liabilities of the late Ameer; 
 
b.  
Recall the revenue record in respect of the properties of late Ameer 
of Bahawalpur Sir Sadiq Muhammad Khan Abbasi for necessary 
correction on the basis of devolution and distribution of property 
(Ameer of Bahawalpur) Order 1969, as amended by the Order 
No.S.R.O.252(I)/2003, dated the 7th March, 2003; hand over 
possession of allotted property on the basis of above order; and if 
desired, call for assistance of the Federal Government in the

Ministry of KANA and SAFRON for the purpose assigned to 
them.” 
 
16. 
However, Federal Government vide notification No.SRO 1117(I)/2003 
dated 20.12.2003 due to ill-health of Mr. Justice (R) Abdul Shakoor-ul-Salam 
and his inability to act as the Chairman of the Implementation Committee 
appointed Justice (R) Abdul Qadeer Chaudhry as the Chairman.  
17. 
The Chairman of the Implementation Committee wrote a letter 
No.F.2/1/Sce.VII/2002 dated 18.08.2004 to Managing Director Cholistan 
Development Authority, Bahawalpur, which reads as follows:

amended by the Orders under S.R.O. No.252(I)/2003 dated 7th March, 2003 and 
S.R.O. No.946(I)/2003, dated the 30th September, 2003.  
 
        In order to implement the above stated SROs, a meeting of the 
Implementation Committee was held in the Circuit House, Bahawalpur on the 
17th April, 2004 (copy of minutes of the meeting attached) under which it was

“SHIKARGAH” measuring 312440 Acres should also be distributed amongst the 
23 legal heirs of late Ameer of Bahawalpur according to the Sharia shares being 
a private property of late Sir Sadiq Muhammad Khan Abbasi, Ameer of 
Bahawalpur.  
 
         Keeping in view the facts, the Implementation Committee in its meeting 
held in Circuit House, Bahawalpur on 15th August, 2004, decided that the subject 
land measuring 34466 Acres already allotted by the Board of Revenue, Punjab, 
under different schemes the effectees be replaced by suitable alternate 
government land or be compensated through payment. Rest of the subject land 
measuring 277974 acres should be divided into the following two categories:  
I. Cultivable land (ممکن)

The subject land in categories (I) and (II) above should be distributed among the 
23 legal heirs, whose name are mentioned in the attached list duly signed by me, 
with the following conditions: 
 
(a) New JAMABANDI be prepared in the name of Sir Sadiq 
Muhammad Khan Abbasi, late Ameer of Bahawalpur in both 
categories separately.  
 
(b) Total land be determined in both the categories, separately.

(d) Mutation be entered in the revenue record in the name of each

heirs should not be fragmented, but kept as one whole parcel 
as per their choice/possession strictly within their ceiling.  
(e) Joint mutation be entered in revenue record in the name of 23 
legal heirs in category (II) straightaway.” 
   
18. 
    The said Committee could not complete the task within the stipulated 
time, hence, the Prime Minister extended the tenure of Implementation 
Committee up to 18.02.2006 vide order No.SRO 819(I)/2005, dated 03.08.2005.  
19.

No.SRO 820(I)/2005 dated 03.08.2005, and ordered the devolution and 
distribution of the properties, keeping in view 01 kanal in Bahawalpur is equal

Order of the Implementation Committee’s Instructions contained in Letter 
No.F.2/1/ Sec.VII/2002, dated 18 August, 2004 addressed to the Managing 
Director, Cholistan Authority, Bahawalpur. The Implementation Committee in 
its report dated 30th September, 2004 recommended as under:- 
(a) 
2,77,974 Acres unsettled land of ‘Shikargah’ be distributed 
among 23 legal heirs according to Shariah shares. 
 
(b) 
Remaining land 34,466 Acres which was allotted to different 
Schemes, Board of Revenue, Punjab may accommodate the 
heirs, either by compensation at market value or land 
adjoining ‘Shikargah’ according to the heirs choice. 
 
20. 
The Implementation Committee submitted compliance report through 
letter dated 21.03.2006. In the said compliance report, consisting upon 11 pages, 
the Implementation Committee in para No.19 and 20 observed as under: 
“The Committee mutated the entire property viz packages and joint mutations, 
belonging to the private property of late Ameer of Bahawalpur among his 23 
legal heirs in the revenue record, according to the Sharia shares, except the 
land known “Shikargah” measuring 277974 Acres out of total land measuring 
312440 Acres. In this regard, Committee decided that the issue of 
compensation in lieu of 34466 Acres land of late Ameer would be perused by 
the Federal Government. On the allotment of land known “Shikargah” Dr. 
Faisal Zahoor, District Revenue Officer, Bahawalpur, is of the view that the 
land was resumed under the West Pakistan Land Reforms Regulations, 1959, 
therefore, further action in this regard may not be taken. Moreover, the Chief 
Land Commissioner, Punjab, has assumed a Suo Motu Revision No.11 of 
1990. The Committee, however, concluded that the land known “Shikargah” 
has been adjudged in favour of legal heirs by order of the Federal 
Government vide SRO-820(I)/2005 dated 03.08.2005 superseded the 
decision/policy of the Board of Revenue, Punjab. Moreover, the Supreme 
Court’s judgments in Civil Appeal No.130/78 set-aside the order of the Land 
Reforms Authorities till respondent No.3 the Federal Government makes the 
final order under Article 03 of the Acceding State (Property) Order, 1961. 
Therefore, the Committee decided that land measuring 277974 acres called 
Shikargah, Cholistan shall be distributed among 23 legal heirs of late Ameer 
of Bahawalpur in the light of the Implementation Committee’s instructions 
contained in letter No.2/1/Sec.VII/2002, dated the 18th August, 2004 (Annex-
XI) which is accordingly incorporated in the Implementation Committee 
Report 2004 and the Federal Government’s Order vide S.R.O-820(I)/2005 
dated 03.08.2005.  
 
20.     In order to implement the order of the Federal Government notified in 
SRO-820(I)/2005 dated 03.08.2005 with regard to distribution of land called 
“Shikargah” measuring 277974 acres among 23 legal heirs, the Vice 
Chairman/Managing 
Director, 
Cholistan 
Development 
Authority, 
Bahawalpur was invited in the meeting of the Implementation Committee held 
on the 31st January, 2006 at Lahore. Wherein, it was decided that the 

Writ Petition No.2916 of 2006. 
Writ Petition No.7305 of 2019.  
-14-
Cholistan Development Authority (CDA), Bahawalpur may prepare the 
“Proposed Allotment Plan” and submit it in the next meeting of the 
Committee at Lahore. The Office of the CDA, Bahawalpur, prepared and 
presented the draft “Allotment Plan” along with map (Annex-XII) in the 
Committee’s meeting held on 13th February, 2006 at Lahore proposing 23 
packages in two each category i.e. cultivable and uncultivable. At the request 
of some of the legal heirs of late Ameer, it was decided that they should submit 
their objections against the “Proposed VANDAs” by the 15th February, 2006. 
No such objection was filed within the stipulated period. However, on the 
request of some legal heirs, 15 days were granted to file the objections against 
“Proposed VANDAs”, subject to the condition that if the extension is granted 
by the Government as the tenure of the Committee is to expire on 18th 
February, 2006. No extension was granted uptil now, however, a publication 
was made in the newspaper dated 06th March, 2006 (Annex-XIII). Five 
applications were received and forwarded to the Federal Government for 
appropriate decision, as the Committee cannot dispose of these applications 
after 18th February, 2006.”   
 
21. 
     The Federal Government through Ministry of ‘SAFRON’ in exercise 
of the powers conferred under Article 3 of the Order 1961 subsequently through 
Notification No.SRO 436(I)/2006 dated 10.05.2006 distributed ‘Shikargah’ land 
measuring 2,77,974 acres out of total land measuring 3,12,440 acres amongst 
the legal heirs of Sir Sadiq Muhammad Khan Abbasi. All land of ‘Shikargah’ i.e. 
cultivable and non-cultivable has been distributed amongst 23 legal heirs vide 
said impugned notification according to ‘Shariah’ share. It was also directed 
through said Notification that the possession of allotted property shall also be 
handed over to the allottees in the following manner: - 
“2. The Implementation Committee headed by Mr. Justice  
(Retd) Abdul Qudeer Chaudhry shall hand over the 
possession of allotted property on the basis of this Order in 
terms of S.R.O.321(I)/2003 dated the 26th March, 2003.  
 
3. The words ‘SARKAR DAULAT MADAR’ appearing in the 
revenue record of the Bahawalpur city may be substituted 
with the words ‘Government of the Punjab’ to protect 
government offices/institutions. 
 
4. The amount lying in the account of National Bank of 
Pakistan, Bahawalpur, shall be distributed amongst twenty 
three legal heirs after determining the liabilities and 
keeping sufficient amount for administrative expenditure 
after mutation, transfer of the entire property.”  
 

Writ Petition No.2916 of 2006. 
Writ Petition No.7305 of 2019.  
-15-
   In this way the entire private property of late Ameer of Bahawalpur 
measuring 44055 Acres, 05 Kanalas & 03 Marlas (settled land) and 3,12,440 
Acres (unsettled land) had been distributed amongst 23 legal heirs of late Ameer 
of Bahawalpur.  
22. 
       As far as the contention of the petitioners that ‘Wandas’ had not been 
prepared according to parameters recommended/decided by the Chairman, 
Implementation Committee is concerned, it is submitted that the Implementation 
Committee, with the assistance of the Cholistan Development Authority, 
Bahawalpur prepared a draft allotment plan called ‘VANDAs’ and handed it over 
to the Implementation Committee who in term submitted its ‘Compliance 
Report’ dated 21.03.2006 alongwith proposed 23 Packages (VANDAs) through 
the Federal Government (Ministry of SAFRON).  
23. 
       Majority of legal heirs of late Ameer of Bahawalpur appreciated the 
preparation of 24 ‘Wandas’ and its Notification dated 10.05.2006. However, 
some of them raised certain objections. The Implementation Committee 
forwarded their objections to the Federal Government for appropriate decision, 
as the Committee could not dispose of these objections after 18th February, 2006. 
If the petitioners have filed any objections within the stipulated time, they may 
approach the Federal Government for redressal of their grievance. 
24. 
     For two years between 2003-2005, the Implementation Committee 
heard all the surviving legal heirs and provided right of hearing. The seven legal 
heirs and sixty five decedents signed the Distribution Agreement. The 
Implementation Committee published the relevant hearing dates and the venue, 
in the newspapers in English and Urdu. After that the Implementation 

Writ Petition No.2916 of 2006. 
Writ Petition No.7305 of 2019.  
-16-
Committee made its recommendations to the Federal Government which were 
approved and notified on the 5th of August, 2005 and 10 May 2006. 
             The complaints that the shares inherited by them in the ‘Shikargah’ 
includes roads and canals have no value. 
  No active canal system exists in the desert i.e. ‘Shikargah’s land. 
Although an irrigation plan was proposed hundred years ago and may exists on a 
map in a department, but in reality, it was abandoned and whatever was began 
on the ground has long since disappeared under sand. Secondly, tarranced road 
in the share of the party, in the middle of the desert, can only increase that party 
land value. 
25. 
  The petitioners impugned the said notification while levelling general 
allegations to the effect that said ‘Wanda Jaat’ were not prepared in accordance 
with law, letter issued by the Implementation Committee and the judgments of 
the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan but during lengthy arguments they failed 
to point out any specific shortcoming, illegality or irregularity in the ‘Wanda 
Jaat’. Mere on general allegation the hard work done by the Implementation 
Committee cannot be brushed aside. The issue of the devolution and distribution 
of the land called ‘Shikargah’ was complicated. After thorough deliberations the 
Committee proposed its distribution plan and implemented through impugned 
notification which cannot be set-aside merely on surmises and conjectures.  
26. 
       Learned counsel for the petitioners also argued that the 
Implementation Committee totally ignored the recommendation made by the 
Committee headed by Mr. Justice (R) Abdul Shakoor-ul-Salam in its report 
dated 05.06.2002 whereby it was recommended that before actual partition of 

Writ Petition No.2916 of 2006. 
Writ Petition No.7305 of 2019.  
-17-
the land first of all the matter regarding the applicability of the Land Reforms 
Ordinance, 1959, was to be decided.  
27. 
     Said controversy was resolved by the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in its judgment dated 07.04.1982 passed in the case titled “Brig. His 
Highness Nawab Muhammad Abbas Khan Abbasi V. Deputy Land Commissioner, 
Bahawalpur and others” (1982 SCMR 991) wherein it was observed as under: 
“The result will be that as soon as the final position of the holdings of the heirs 
of late Ameer of Bahawalpur has been decided by respondent No.3, respondents 
Nos.1 & 2 will be at liberty to proceed under the provisions of the Land Reforms 
Regulations, 1959 (M.L.R-64). The orders of the Land Reforms Authorities 
impugned before us are accordingly set aside with the clarification that as soon 
as respondent No.3 makes the final order under Article 03 of the Acceding State 
Property Order, 1961, the respondents Nos.1 & 2 can proceed further in the 
matter in accordance with law.”  
 
Although the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan while setting-aside the 
orders of the Land Reforms Authorities clarified that as soon as the Federal 
Government makes the final order under Article 3 of the Order, 1961, the Land 
Reforms Authorities can proceed further in the matter in accordance with law 
but the Chief Land Commissioner initiated suo motu proceedings on 20.02.1990, 
which was challenged through Writ Petition (W.P No.15422/2010) “Prince A.M. 
Abbasi V. Land Commission, etc.”. Said Writ Petition was decided by Division 
Bench of this Court vide order dated 17.10.2011 and observed as under: 
“In this view of the matter, without going into the merits of the case, judgment of 
the august Supreme Court of Pakistan, mentioned above, has to be implemented 
in letter and spirit and, therefore, the suo motu proceedings initiated by Chief 
Land Commissioner on 20.02.1990 are in violation of the judgment of the august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan dated 07.04.1982 and are, therefore, set-aside. 
Respondents are directed to implement the judgment of the august Supreme 
Court of Pakistan strictly in accordance with law and to proceed accordingly.” 
 
Said judgment of this Court was assailed before the august Supreme Court 
of Pakistan and the said Court disposed of the appeal through order dated 
02.10.2018 while observing as under: 
“5. When confronted with the aforesaid state of affairs, the learned Addl. A. G. 
Punjab, states that the instant appeals have lost its efficacy as the conditions 

Writ Petition No.2916 of 2006. 
Writ Petition No.7305 of 2019.  
-18-
specified for proceedings under MLR-64 by the impugned judgment have been 
fulfilled. Under the circumstances, the instant appeals are liable to be disposed 
of.  
6. In the above circumstances, these appeals are disposed of. Any person 
aggrieved by any future action taken by any authority can seek his remedy, if any, 
available under the law.”  
 
The implementation Committee was well-aware of the decision of the 
august Supreme Court of Pakistan dated 07.04.1982 passed in Civil Appeal 
No.130/78 and discussed it in para No.19 of its report as referred supra and 
made its proposal. In the light of said proposal through notification No.SRO-
946(I)2003 dated 30.09.2003 para 04 of the Order1969 was omitted and para 05 
of the Order 1969 was substituted as under: 
“5. The entire property of the Late Ameer of Bahawalpur shall be distributed 
and dealt with first in the manner specified in paragraph 03 and thereafter 
action shall be taken in accordance with the provisions of the Land Reforms 
Regulation, 1959.”   
 
 
  
In view of the above, the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for 
the petitioners have no force, hence, repelled accordingly.  
28. 
       The Federal Government through Notification No. SRO.257(I)/2019 
dated 27.02.2019 reconstituted the Implementation Committee and settled its 
terms of reference as follows:- 
“(a) 
Distribute all income in the hands of State received from 
production of properties of late Ameer of Bahawhalpur 
amongst 23 legal heirs according to Shariah shares after 
keeping sufficient amount for administrative purposes and 
discharge of their liabilities of the Ameer; 
 
(b) 
Recall the revenue records in respect of the properties of 
late Ameer of Bahawalpur Sir Muhammad Khan Abbasi 
for necessary correction on the basis of devolution and 
distribution of property (Ameer of Bahawalpur) Order 
1969 as amended by the Order No.SRO.252(I)/2003 dated 
7th March, 2003; 
 
(c) 
Hand over possession of allotted property on the basis of 
above order; And 
 

Writ Petition No.2916 of 2006. 
Writ Petition No.7305 of 2019.  
-19-
(d) 
If desires call for assistance of the Federal Government in 
the Ministry of States and Frontier Regions” 
 
 
29. 
    As per the Acceding State (Property) Order, 1961 (President’s Order 
No.12 of 1961), the ultimate decision of devolution and distribution of the 
property of late Ameer of Bahawalpur rests with the Federal Government. An 
important provision in Article 03 of this order lays down that where any 
question arises directly or indirectly between persons claiming to be the heirs 
and successors of the Ruler of a State or claiming to succeed to the State, 
concerning the devolution and distribution of any property of that State or of the 
Ruler, the question shall be decided by an order of the Central Government. In 
this manner, the Central Government was made the Arbitrator for the settlement 
of the disputes between the persons claiming to be the heirs and successors of 
the Ruler, concerning the devolution and distribution of his property. For ease, 
said Article is reproduced as under: 
“Where any question arises directly or indirectly between persons claiming to 
be the heirs and successors of the Ruler of a State or claiming to succeed to 
the State, concerning the devolution and distribution of any property of that 
State or of Ruler the question shall be decided by an order of the Central 
Government”.  
 
Another Article No.7 of the President’s Order No.12 of 1961 is also 
relevant which is reproduced as under: 
“No Court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any such question as is referred 
to in Article 03, and no Court shall call in question any order of the Central 
Government made under that Article or Article 05 or any proceedings 
conducted therewith.”  
 
30. 
 As discussed above, all the questions relating to the distribution and 
devolution of properties of the late Ameer of Bahawalpur would be resolved by 
the Central Government. The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan while 
considering said aspect in a case titled “Sahibzada Muhammad Usman Khan 

Writ Petition No.2916 of 2006. 
Writ Petition No.7305 of 2019.  
-20-
Abbasi, etc. V. Islamic Republic of Pakistan through Secretary M/O KANA and 
SAFRON, Islamabad, etc.”  vide order dated 21.05.2020 observed as under: 
“Learned counsel for the petitioners contends that the impugned judgment 
passed by the learned High Court cannot be sustained on the ground that after 
the promulgation of Presidential Order No.12 of 1961 called the Acceding State 
(Property) Order, 1961 (issued vide notification dated 02.11.1961), all the 
questions relating to the distribution and devolution of properties of the Ameer of 
Bahawalpur would be resolved by the Central Government. The dispute as to 
between the claimants of the property whether the legal heirs inter se or any 
other third party of that State or Ruler, is to be regulated in terms of Article 03 of 
the Presidential Order, 1961 referred to above. He further contends that Federal 
Government has finalized the devolution and distribution of the properties of the 
Ameer of Bahawalpur after considering in the recommendation of the 
Implementation Committee (placed at pages 82-92). He further contends that in 
terms of Presidential Order, 1961, no question could be raised before any Court 
yet Writ Petition was entertained wherein it was directed that controversy is to 
be resolved by the Senior Member Board of Revenue. It is stated that if at all any 
controversy is to be resolved it could only be resolved by the Federal 
Government as noted in the Presidential Order, 1961. Respondent No.36 
(Ghulam Rasool Khan) herein who claims to be acting as probono states that the 
property in dispute cannot be given to the petitioners. When such controversy 
was raised before the High Court the matter was referred to the Senior Member 
Board of Revenue and the writ petition was disposed of accordingly.  
 
2. 
As noted above, that whatever the nature of dispute is, in terms of the 
Presidential Order, 1961, it is to be resolved and decided by the Federal 
Government. Therefore, let the parties approach the Federal Government for the 
dispute impugned before the High Court and decide it in accordance with law. In 
view of the foregoing reasons the instant petition is converted into appeal and 
allowed.”                              (underline for emphasis) 
 
 
In view of the above discussion this Court has no jurisdiction to 
adjudicate upon this matter.  
31. 
For the foregoing reasons, Writ Petition No.2916 of 2006/BWP and Writ 
Petition No.7305 of 2019/BWP have no force/substance which are dismissed 
accordingly.  All the pending Civil Miscellaneous (including applications under 
Order I Rule 10 C.P.C.) are also disposed of accordingly.
