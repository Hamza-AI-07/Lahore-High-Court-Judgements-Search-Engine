Date of hearing:     11.09.2023. 
Appellant by: 
Mr. Ashar Elahi, Advocate.  
Respondents by: 
Mr.  Muhammad Imran Malik, Advocate.  
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.- Through 
instant appeal, appellant has called into question vires of order 
dated 12.11.2019, passed by learned Judge Banking Court-I, 
Lahore, whereby plaint of appellant’s suit for recovery of 
Rs.24,376,956.48 along with cost of funds and mark-up etc., was 
returned by invoking the provisions of Order VII Rule 10 CPC for 
its presentation before the proper forum.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the appellant-bank submits that learned 
Banking Court relied upon Clause 24 of the finance agreement, 
whereby the parties agreed that the territorial jurisdiction would be 
at Gujranwala, however, it failed to appreciate that mere agreement 
between the parties could not confer the jurisdiction upon the Court. 
He adds that impugned order, being absolutely illegal and unlawful, 
is unsustainable in the eye of law. In this regard, he referred to 
Tahir Tariq Textile Mills (Pvt.) Ltd. through Chief Executive and 2 
others v. N.D.F.C. through Chairman (2001 YLR 846) and High 
Noon Textile Ltd. through Authorized Attorney and 2 others v. 
Saudi Pak Industrial and Agricultural Investment Co. (Pvt.) Ltd. 
through Authorized Attorney and 4 others (2010 CLD 567).

3. 
Contrarily, learned counsel for respondents defends the 
impugned order by contending that appellants have failed to 
pinpoint any illegality or legal infirmity in the impugned order, 
thus, no interference is warranted.  
4. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused. 
5. 
Record reflects that appellant-bank instituted suit under 
Section 9 of the Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) 
Ordinance (“FIO”), 2001 for recovery of Rs.24,376,956.48 along 
with cost of funds and mark-up, liquidated damages, costs and 
expenses etc. till the final realization of the suit amount, plaint 
whereof was returned by learned Banking Court while invoking the 
provisions of Order VII Rule 10 CPC for its presentation before the 
proper forum, on the basis of Clause-24 of the finance agreement.  
For facility of reference, impugned order, which also 
contains Clause-24 ibid, is reproduced hereunder:- 
“No one has turned up on behalf of plaintiff today. 
Learned counsel for the defendant has submitted that this 
Court has no jurisdiction to entertain this suit as per terms and 
conditions of the finance agreement.  
The finance agreement is available at page 25 of the 
file. Its Clause-24 may read as under:- 
“This agreement shall be governed and construed 
in accordance with laws of Pakistan and Courts / 
Tribunals at Gujranwala shall have non-exclusive 
jurisdiction.” 
The suit has been instituted by the bank, relying upon 
the said document. The parties are bound by its terms and 
conditions and once the jurisdiction of a particular court has 
been determined no other Court can exercise the jurisdiction of 
the said matter. The jurisdiction of this Court was ousted by 
the parties in the finance agreement. This being so the plaint is 
hereby returned as provided under Order VII Rule 10 CPC for 
its presentation before the proper forum. The office shall 
retained the photocopies of the proceedings which shall be 
consigned to the record after due compilation.” 
 
6. 
The 
matter 
of 
jurisdiction 
of 
Courts 
regarding 
determination and enforcement of contractual rights and 
obligations is usually incorporated under forum selection clauses 

 
 
FAO No.75308 of 2019

of a contract. There are two broad categories under forum 
selection clauses and this categorization is depending on the 
intention of the parties to a contract as expressed in the language 
of the forum selection clause. A contract may contain an 
exclusive jurisdiction clause or a non-exclusive jurisdiction 
clause. Traditionally, a clear cut distinction could be traced out in 
common law jurisdictions between an exclusive jurisdiction 
clause and a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause. Under a 
traditional exclusive jurisdiction clause the parties to a contract 
agree that disputes arising out of the contract will be decided 
exclusively by the court chosen by the parties while under a 
traditional non-exclusive jurisdiction clause parties to a contract 
agree that a particular court or courts will be having the 
jurisdiction to decide a matter pertaining to the contract however 
such a clause meant a preferable jurisdiction meaning thereby 
that jurisdiction of other courts was not ousted altogether.  
7. 
In the modern contracts this clear cut traditional distinction 
between an exclusive jurisdiction clause and a non-exclusive 
jurisdiction clause has faded away with the passage of time due 
to multiple factors including increasing use and growing 
litigation in relation to such clauses, more sophistication in 
drafting contracts and a variation in interpretation of these 
clauses specially a non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses by court of 
different jurisdictions. This scenario has led to situations where 
sometimes a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause gives rise to same 
effects as that of an exclusive jurisdiction clause. In such a 
scenario the traditional distinction between these clauses seems 
to be an illusory one. Nevertheless, a distinction can be drawn 
and ascertained on the basis of the content and scope of the 
contractual bargain of the parties to a contract. This brings the 
matter of a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause in the domain of 
inference from other clauses of such an agreement as well as 
construction of a specific agreement on case to case basis by

ascertaining the real intent of the parties regarding choice of 
forum. 
8. 
Needless to say that the parties by their agreement or consent 
cannot invest Court with a jurisdiction where it does not exist in 
law nor can the parties divest a Court of its jurisdiction by such 
methodology. Where more than one Court has jurisdiction in the 
matter, the parties can make choice by their agreement or consent 
for conferment of jurisdiction upon one Court to the exclusion of 
other and agreement in such behalf in normal circumstances is 
binding upon parties thereto. And such choice of forum by 
agreement is not contrary to the mandate of Section 28 of the 
Contract Act, 1872. However, the condition precedent to make a 
choice by the parties through an agreement is thus that the Court or 
the Tribunal so chosen has the jurisdiction under the law. When 
question arises as to the nature of jurisdiction agreed to between the 
parties, the Court has to decide the same on a true interpretation of 
the contract on the facts and in the circumstances of each case. 
Reference is made to Multan Electric Power Company Ltd. through 
Chief Executive and another v. Muhammad Ashiq and others (PLD 
2006 Supreme Court 328), Muhammad Saddiq v. Askri Leasing 
Ltd. through Chairman and 2 others (2009 YLR 900), COMSET 
Services Limited v. Holger Hahn and another [2009 PLC (C.S.) 
446], Pakistan KUWAIT Investment Company (Pvt.) Limited 
through Authorized Representative v. Messrs Active Apparels 
International and 6 others (2012 CLD 1036), Messrs Raziq 
International (Pvt) Ltd. through Vice President v. Panalpina 
Management Ltd. (PLD 2014 Sindh 175), Bepin Behary Law v. 
Mohit Kumar Pal and others [A.I.R. (29) 1942 Calcutta 496] and 
Radha Kishen v. Bombay Company Ltd. [A.I.R. (30) 1943 Lahore

9. 
In view of the above discussion, since learned Banking Court 
not only misconceived / ignored the distinction between these 
two broad categories of the forum selection clauses but also 

 
 
FAO No.75308 of 2019 
 
5
straight away ordered the return of plaint without deliberating 
upon same and without making any effort to ascertain the real 
intent of the parties under the said non-exclusive jurisdiction 
clause, therefore, the impugned order being devoid of any valid 
lawful reasons is not sustainable in the eye of law.  
10. 
Resultantly, this appeal is allowed and impugned order dated 
12.11.2019, passed by learned Judge Banking Court-I, Lahore, is 
set aside. Consequently, appellant’s suit shall be deemed to be 
pending before learned Judge Banking Court, who is directed to 
decide the suit on merits in accordance with law, within a period of 
sixty days from the date being fixed by this Court, through a well-
reasoned judgment, under intimation to this Court through Deputy 
Registrar (Judicial). Parties are directed to appear before learned 
Judge Banking Court on 26.09.2023. Office shall transmit copy of 
this judgment to the concerned Court immediately.
