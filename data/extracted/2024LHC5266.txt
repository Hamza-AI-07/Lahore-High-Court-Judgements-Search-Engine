JUDGMENT 
 
 
Date of Hearing: 
06.11.2024 
Petitioners by: 
Ch. Rashid Abdullah, Advocate  
Respondents by: 
Ch. Sarfraz Ali Dial, Advocate 
 
JAWAD HASSAN, J. The Petitioners have filed this Civil Revision 
under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (the "CPC"), 
challenging the judgments and decrees dated 09.01.2023 and 30.07.2021, 
passed by the learned Courts below, being illegal and unlawful.  
2. 
Through this judgment, the Court will examine the illegality and 
irregularity allegedly committed by the learned Courts below within the 
revisional jurisdiction of this Court. 
3. 
Brief facts of the case are that the Petitioners filed a suit for specific 
performance of an agreement to sell and for permanent injunction, with the 
averments that the Respondents, being in possession of 20/52 shares of land 
measuring 1 kanal, situated in Khewat No.86, Khatooni No.112, Khasra No. 
267, as per the register haqdaran zamin for the year 2006-07, situated at 
Mouza Naglian, Tehsil Pasrur, District Sialkot, sold the said land for 
Rs.740,000/- to the Petitioners, received Rs.275,000/- as earnest money and 
executed an agreement to sell dated 08.06.2009 in their favour. Thereafter, 
the Petitioners many times asked the Respondents to receive the balance

amount and execute the sale deed in their favour, but they refused, 
whereupon the present suit was instituted. The learned Trial Court, after 
framing the issues and recording the evidence of the parties, dismissed the 
suit on 30.07.2021. Feeling aggrieved, the Petitioners filed an appeal before 
the learned Appellate Court, which met with the same fate vide judgment 
and decree dated 09.01.2023. Hence, this Petition. 
4. 
Learned counsel for the Petitioners submitted that the impugned 
judgments and decrees are result of misreading and non-reading of evidence. 
Added that during pendency of Appeal, the Petitioners filed an Application 
under Order XLI Rule 27 CPC seeking permission to produce additional 
evidence. Learned counsel while drawing the attention of the Court to the 
impugned judgments submitted that the same are not tenable in the eyes of 
law because the learned Appellate Court has not only decided the 
Application for additional evidence but also decided the appeal on the same 
day i.e. 09.01.2023.  
5. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the Respondents submitted that it is 
not the requirement of law that in all eventualities the learned Appellate 
Court should decide the Application for additional evidence separately. He 
further argued that the impugned judgments cannot be set aside merely on 
this sole ground.  
6. 
Heard. Record Perused.  
7. 
The nub of the matter in this case is whether the Appellate Court is 
obliged to first decide the application for additional evidence before 
adverting to the merits of the appeal. It would, thus, be apt in the first 
instance to attend to the above question, instead of dilating upon the merits 
of the case, lest it prejudice the case of either side. 
8. 
It is evident from record that the suit was initially dismissed by the 
learned trial Court vide judgment and decree dated 30.07.2021, which was 
challenged by the Petitioners through an appeal before the learned Appellate 
Court. During the pendency of that appeal, the Petitioners filed an 
application under Order XLI Rule 27 CPC, seeking permission to produce 

 
 
 
C.R. No.6830 of 2023 
 
 
- 3 - 
additional evidence. Perusal of order dated 09.01.2023, shows that although 
the Appellate Court dismissed the aforesaid application but it was done on 
the same day and at the same time as the appeal, in the following manner: 
However, the record shows that petitioner has moved an 
application to obtain the said record on 01.10.2020 and on the 
same day the attested copies of said documents were delivered 
to the present petitioner Muhammad Iqbal Gill which prima 
facie shows that the document in question was available to the 
petitioner at trial stage as the learned trial court had decided 
the case on 30.07.2021. Therefore, the ground that has been 
taken by the petitioner that the said document was not available 
to him at the time of trial does not seems plausible. Henceforth, 
the said application is hereby dismissed being devoid of merits. 
Vide my separate judgment in English of even dated, the 
appeal in hand is hereby dismissed. … 
 
It is a well-established principle of law that whenever a miscellaneous 
application is pending before the Court, it must be decided first before 
finalizing the lis. Failure to decide the miscellaneous application before the 
final verdict would render the latter a nullity in the eyes of the law.  
I. 
SUPREME COURT OF PAKISTAN: 
9. 
As discussed above, the Appellate Court on the same date i.e. 
09.01.2023, while announcing the order regarding dismissal of application 
under Order XLI Rule 27 of CPC also recorded in the next paragraph that 
“vide my separate judgment in English of even dated, the appeal in hand is 
hereby dismissed.” This is against the principles consistently developed by 
the Supreme Court of Pakistan that any pending miscellaneous application, 
such as one for additional evidence, must be decided before addressing the 
merits of the case to ensure procedural fairness. Hence to resolve such 
interim matters before pronouncing a final judgment can result in procedural 
irregularity, rendering the final decision legally flawed. In the judgment 
reported as “Muhammad Azam versus Muhammad Abdullah through LRs” 
(2009 SCMR 326), the Supreme Court has observed that … We have 
examined the record of learned High Court, according to which appellant 
had filed application (Civil Miscellaneous Application No.370/C of 1990) 

 
 
 
C.R. No.6830 of 2023 
 
 
- 4 - 
for production of additional evidence on 23.01.1990. Notice was issued to 
the respondent and it was observed that this application shall be decided 
alongwith main case (Civil Revision No.83 of 1990). However, the learned 
High Court decided the revision petition brought by appellant without taking 
into consideration documents in question and without disposal of said 
application for additional evidence. As such we find that case of appellant 
has been prejudiced. Even otherwise the case of the appellant is that he is 
co-sharer in the Khewats in question, therefore, it was in the interest of 
justice that High Court should have decided his application before final 
adjudication of the case. The Supreme Court in another judgment cited as 
“Mst. Imtiaz Begum versus Mst. Sultan Jan and others” (2008 SCMR 1259) 
has held that … Accordingly we do not consider it a complete and full 
adjudication of the disputatious questions of law and facts involved in Civil 
Revision No.14 of 1996. So, the impugned judgment with regard to Civil 
Revision No.14 of 1996, delivered by the learned Peshawar High Court, 
Abbotabad Bench is set aside and the case is remanded to the 
aforementioned learned High Court, considering Civil Revision No.14 of 
1996 to be pending before it, with direction to decide the application Civils 
Miscellaneous bearing No.22 of 1996 filed by Qamar Zaman as well as the 
civil revision afresh after grant of opportunity of hearing to the parties to 
the above noted revision. It has also been held in the judgment reported as 
“Muhammad Umer versus Muhammad Qasim and another” (1991 SCMR 
1232) that … The same point has been urged before us. The learned Civil 
Judge while dismissing the suit of the petitioner mainly relied upon the order 
of the Deputy Land Commissioner whereby the land allotted in the name of 
the petitioner was cancelled. But this order of cancellation was set at naught 
by then Land Commissioner. As per the record, the petitioner sought to 
produce the same vide application made under Order XLI, Rule 27 CPC, 
and we think that once the Appellate Court was seized of the matter, i.e. the 
application under Order XLI Rule 27 CPC it ought to have adjudicated upon 
the same before disposing of the appeal.

II. 
LAHORE HIGH COURT 
10. 
Whilst deriving guidance formulated by the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in aforementioned judgments, this Court on the issue in hand, held 
in the judgment reported as “Mst. Ghulam Fatima and others versus Pahar 
Khan and others” (2024 CLC 1538) that … in case of pendency of some 
miscellaneous application, it is incumbent upon the court to first decide the 
application and then advert to the merits of the case. The primary object is 
that a lis should be buried in all respects as per canons of justice and by 
deciding the miscellaneous application in the first instance, allowing parties 
to retrace the steps fairly and equitably. Allowing a court to decide the 
application for additional evidence alongwith the appeal would amount to 
give a premium to decide such application in negative. The joint decision of 
the miscellaneous application and appeal would not be even possible, if the 
court ultimately reaches at the conclusion that the application has due force 
and it is to be accepted. It would thus be in all fairness that the court should 
first decide the miscellaneous application and then pass final 
order/judgment qua the lis. It has been also observed in the judgment of this 
Court reported as “Abdul Jabbar Shahid and others versus National Bank of 
Pakistan and others” (PLD 2019 Lahore 76) that … It is settled principle of 
law that non-disposal of the miscellaneous applications while deciding the 
main case vitiates the final order. Moreover, in the judgment reported as 
“Azra Manzoor Aureshi versus Faysal Bank Limited and 2 others” (2005 
CLD 1417) it has been held by this Court that … It is settled law by now that 
if any miscellaneous application is filed by the party, it is incumbent upon 
the learned Court to decide the said application either way, through a 
specific order and then to decide the main case and failure to decide such an 
application would vitiate the main judgment. Further reliance is placed on 
the judgments reported as “Khair Deen  Versus Rehm Deen and 4 others” 
(1996 CLC 1731), “Muhammad Yaqub versus Baqir and 2 others” (1993 
CLC 1319), “Rehmat Ali Khokhar versus Mst. Sardaran Bibi and 15 others” 

 
 
 
C.R. No.6830 of 2023 
 
 
- 6 - 
(PLD 1986 Lahore 283) and “Muhammad Hussain versus Bulleh Khan” 
(1980 CLC 608).  
III. 
SINDH HIGH COURT 
11. 
Significant to mention here that the esteemed judgments mentioned 
supra have been reiterated by Sindh High Court in case reported “PAK 
CARPET INDUSTRIES LIMITED versus GOVERNMENT OF SINDH and 2 
others” (1993 CLC 334), wherein it has been observed that … A perusal of 
R&P of the Appellate Court shows that application under Order 41 Rule 27, 
CPC was moved by the plaintiff/appellant on 09.07.1984 and notice for its 
hearing was ordered to be issued for 02.08.1984 and it was adjourned from 
time to time for one reason or the other and thereafter, perhaps due to 
inadvertence, it was forgotten and main appeal itself was heard and decided. 
This was extremely improper on the part of learned Appellate Court. Before 
hearing final arguments in a suit or an appeal, it is incumbent upon the 
Court first ensure that every Misc. Application filed by any of the parties 
stands disposed of, notwithstanding the fact as to whether the party 
concerned presses it or not. If it is not pressed, it may be dismissed on that 
account but a specific order must be passed in that regard. 
IV. 
OPINION OF THE COURT 
12. 
Upon careful consideration of the matter in hand, it becomes 
abundantly clear that, according to established legal principles, whenever a 
miscellaneous application, such as an application under Order XLI, Rule 27 
CPC for production of additional evidence, is pending during the course of 
an appeal, it is imperative for the Appellate Court to first decide the said 
application before delving into the merits of the appeal. This procedural 
requirement is not merely a technical formality, but a critical component of 
ensuring that justice is served fairly and equitably. The failure to resolve 
such a pending application prior to rendering a final decision on the appeal 
leads to a procedural irregularity that invalidates the entire appellate process, 
as it deprives the parties of their right to a fair and impartial hearing. The 
law unequivocally mandates that all pending miscellaneous applications 

 
 
 
C.R. No.6830 of 2023 
 
 
- 7 - 
must be disposed of before addressing the main case, as the non-disposal of 
such applications creates an imbalance and potentially prejudices the case of 
the concerned party. A joint decision, where both the miscellaneous 
application and the appeal are decided together, without first addressing the 
application separately, undermines the fairness of the judicial proceedings, 
as it gives undue weight to the appeal and may result in the improper 
rejection of the application. Furthermore, deciding both the application and 
the appeal simultaneously denies the parties an opportunity to properly argue 
and substantiate their respective positions regarding the additional evidence. 
This is a fundamental breach of the principles of justice and procedural 
propriety.  
13. 
Furthermore, this Court has to analyze the allegations of jurisdictional 
error, such as the jurisdiction that is vested in it by law was not exercised, 
and/or the court has acted in exercise of its jurisdiction illegally or with 
material irregularity, or committed some error of procedure in the course of 
the trial which is material and has affected the ultimate decision. Reliance in 
this regard is placed on the judgment reported as “Haji MUSHARRAF 
MAHMOOD KHAN (deceased) through L.Rs. versus SARDARZADA ZAFAR 
ABBAS (deceased) through L.Rs. and others” (PLD 2024 SC 588), wherein 
it has been held that “the Revisional Court can even exercise its suo motu 
jurisdiction to ensure effective superintendence and visitorial powers to 
make sure, by all means, the strict adherence to the safe administration of 
justice, and may correct any error unhindered by technicalities.”  
14. 
For the foregoing reasons, this civil revision is allowed, the impugned 
order/judgment and decree dated 09.01.2023, passed by the learned 
Appellate Court is set aside. As a sequel whereof, the appeal as well as 
application under Order XLI Rule 27 of CPC shall be deemed to be pending 
before the Appellate Court. The Appellate Court shall first adjudicate upon 
the pending application for additional evidence and after a proper and 
independent determination of the same, proceed to consider and decide the 
appeal on its own merits, strictly in accordance with law.

Parties shall appear before the learned Appellate Court/Additional 
District Judge, Pasrur, seized with the matter, on 02.12.2024. Needless to 
observe that it is expected from the Court, seized with the matter, to take all 
necessary steps for early conclusion of the appeal, which shall preferably be 
decided within two (02) months from the first appearance of the Parties 
before the said Court. No order as to cost.
