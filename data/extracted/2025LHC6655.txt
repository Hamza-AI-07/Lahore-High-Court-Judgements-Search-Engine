JUDGMENT 
Date of hearing 
19.11.2025 
For applicant

Sikandar and Muhammad Imran Ghazi, 
Advocates 
For respondents 
Barrister Malik Sohail Ashiq Shujra, 
Advocate for respondents – PRA.  
 
ASIM HAFEEZ, J.  Case of the applicant is that questions 
variously raised before Appellate Tribunal, Punjab Revenue 
Authority, Lahore (‘Tribunal’) were neither appreciated nor decided 
and order under reference was passed without proper application of 
judicial mind. Submits that invoking of section 14(3) of the Punjab 
Sales Tax on Services Act, 2012 (Act) retrospectively, merely to 
support the claim of the department, is an error apparent. Adds that 
alleged liability was established in the context of section 52 of the Act 
but without appreciating that effect of limitation extended 
subsequently, by virtue of legislative fiat, could not be extended to 
substantiate proceedings – first and second questions of law reflects 
aforesaid concerns.  
2. 
After hearing learned counsel, it transpired that in essence the 
real dispute is whether liability for payment of withholding tax –

proceedings were initiated against applicant, treated as withholding-
agent, on the premise of alleged failure of the applicant to 
collect/deduct and deposit tax on services, accrued and payable under 
the Act, in lieu of receipt of taxable services. It is not disputed that 
figures, claimed to be the consideration paid in lieu of the services 
received by the applicant, were lifted / identified from the audited 
accounts of the applicant – existence of audited accounts and financial 
position reflected therein is not disputed but precise objection is that 
accumulated figures mentioned in the accounts, in respect of the 
service(s) and alleged to be a taxable service under the Act, need to be 
reconciled to ascertain that which of the services are covered under 
the scope of the Act, rates applicable on qualified services and 
determination of liability upon scrutiny of each and every transaction. 
Learned counsel for the applicant insists that documents, comprising 
of pages more than 2000 were provided but not appreciated. 
3. 
Learned counsel for respondent department when confronted 
could not refute the contents of the show cause notice, wherein 
composite amounts, with respect to the each of services, were 
construed as taxable services and tax @ 16% was charged and 
claimed.  
4. 
There is no cavil that for the purposes of determining the 
obligation / liability of a withholding agent each and every transaction 
has to be reconciled – it was not obligatory for the department to 
identify and segregate each and every incidence of service received by 
the recipient being liable to be subjected to tax as taxable service 
under the Act during relevant tax period, which, i.e., the department,

upon gaining information from undisputed source – [audited accounts 
of the company] – may confront the withholding agent with 
accumulated / composite amount of consideration paid for the services 
received and thereafter it is the responsibility of the withholding agent 
to explain details of each of the transaction(s) and establish that why 
withholding tax, in the capacity of a withholding agent, was not 
collected / deducted, from the payment to be made to the service-
provider, and whether such amount was accordingly deposited. 
Withholding agent may otherwise satisfy department that tax was 
accordingly paid, who otherwise had specific knowledge of each 
transaction.  
5. 
We do not comment that whether documents were provided to 
the adjudicating officer, before passing of the order-in-original, or not 
but if documents were produced before the Tribunal; Tribunal, being a 
fact-determining forum, after affording opportunity to other side, is 
obligated to examine each and every transaction and determine 
element of taxability and amount of tax payable, and once this 
exercise is conducted, Tribunal [it] shall proceed to determine the 
liability of the withholding agent. We are afraid that no such 
reconciliation / rendition of transactions was carried out by the 
Tribunal. 
6. 
In view of aforesaid narrative, we find this fit case for remand 
to the Tribunal, which shall decide the appeal of the applicant afresh, 
accordingly, in light of the concerns recorded. This reference 
application is allowed in aforesaid terms and order of the Tribunal 
dated 26.02.2025 is, hereby, annulled.
