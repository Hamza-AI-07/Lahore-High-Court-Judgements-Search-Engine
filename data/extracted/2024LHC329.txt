ABID HUSSAIN CHATTHA, J: This Judgment shall decide the titled 
and 107 identical Writ Petitions specified in Annexure-A hereof involving 
common questions of law emanating from similar set of facts. For ease of 
reference, the Petitioners and the Respondents in the titled and connected 
Petitions shall hereinafter be collectively referred to as (the “Petitioners”) 
and (the “Respondents”), respectively unless otherwise expressly stated. 
2. 
 
The necessary factual context germane to the controversy is 
that the Petitioners are Government Contractors who participated in various 
tenders floated by multiple procurement agencies operating under the ambit 
of the Federal Government or the Provincial Government of Punjab. After 
having being declared as the lowest bidder or successful bidder, as the case 
may be, the Petitioners were required by the Respondents to deposit 
securities of specified amount in terms of performance security or 
additional performance security / quality assurance security in the form of 
bank guarantee by specifically excluding insurance bond / guarantee from 
an insurance company having at least AA rating from PACRA / JCR under 
the applicable procurement laws, rules and Standard Bidding Documents 
(the “SBDs”). Accordingly, the Petitioners impugned letters issued by the 

3 
 
W. P. No. 23988 / 2022 
 
 
Procuring agencies demanding performance or additional performance / 
quality assurance securities via bank guarantees by excluding insurance 
bond / guarantee from an insurance company. In some of the Petitions, 
Circular dated 29.07.2020 issued by the Punjab Procurement Regulatory 
Authority (the “Authority”) constituted under the Punjab Procurement 
Regulatory Authority Act, 2009 (the “PPRA Act, 2009”) is also 
challenged which endorses the decision of the procuring agencies in the 
Province of Punjab to exclude insurance bond / guarantee from an 
insurance company as a form of security in the SBDs. 
3. 
 
Before proceeding further, it is clarified that different types of 
securities are required from bidders in a typical procurement process 
through the SBDs. The first is referred to as ‘bid security’ which is 
generally taken from all bidders as an expression of their seriousness in 
order to participate in the bidding process. The second is termed as 
‘performance security / guarantee’ which is required from a successful 
bidder to ensure due performance of the contract. The third is called 
‘additional performance security / guarantee or quality assurance security / 
guarantee’ which is demanded from the lowest bidder who quotes a bid 
lower than the estimated bid price of the contract determined by a 
procuring agency to ensure that the quality of the contract project is not 
compromised or the same is not abandoned before its completion. The 
matter in issue in the titled and connected Petitions pertains to performance 
or additional performance / quality assurance securities as opposed to bid 
security. It is importantly noted that initially, the lowest or successful 
bidders in the Province of Punjab raised the question qua quantum of 
performance guarantee or additional performance guarantee / quality 
assurance guarantee in terms of Clauses 26-A and 26-B read with Clause 
15 of the General Directions of SBDs with reference to Rule 56 of the 
Punjab Procurement Rules, 2014 (the “Rules, 2014”) framed under the 
PPRA Act, 2009 which was addressed and resolved by Single Bench and 
Division Bench of this Court in cases titled, “Messrs Ghulam Muhammad 
& Sons v. Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA), Faisalabad through 
Director General and others” (2022 MLD 1216); and “A.M. Construction 

4 
 
W. P. No. 23988 / 2022 
 
 
Company (Private) Limited v. Province of Punjab through Secretary 
Communication and Works Department and others” (2023 CLC 616), 
respectively. In some of the Petitions, the issue has been raised again which 
is declined to be answered as having been previously addressed. Therefore, 
the only alive issue is with respect to the form or kind of security with 
respect to performance, additional performance / quality assurance 
guarantee which may be required by the Respondents from the successful 
or the lowest bidders.   
4. 
 
The controversy has emanated in the context of a peculiar 
legal paradigm. Public procurement by institutions falling under the ambit 
of the Federal Government is being carried out under the umbrella of the 
Public Procurement Regulatory Authority Ordinance, 2002 (the “PPRA 
Ordinance, 2002”) which provides for the establishment of the Public 
Procurement Regulatory Authority (the “Authority”) for regulating 
procurement of goods, services and works in the public sector. The PPRA 
Ordinance, 2002 is supplemented with the Public Procurement Rules, 2004 
(the “Rules, 2004”) framed by the Federal Government read with the 
Public Procurement Regulations, 2008 (the “Regulations, 2008”) framed 
by the Authority. However, public procurement by provincial institutions is 
being regulated under the respective provincial laws. In the Province of 
Punjab, PPRA Act, 2009 and the Rules, 2014 together constitute the 
applicable procurement framework. The Authority constituted under the 
PPRA Act, 2009 serves as an apex regulatory body qua procurement.  
5. 
 
At the same time, the Pakistan Engineering Council (the 
“PEC”) established under Section 3(1) of the Pakistan Engineering 
Council Act, 1975 (the “PEC Act”) as part of its functions also develops 
SBDs for engineering contracts. The SBDs prepared by PEC with respect 
to permissible forms of securities to be tendered by lowest or successful 
bidders, inter alia, include an insurance bond / guarantee from an insurance 
company having AA rating from PACRA / JCR. The Executive Committee 
of National Economic Council (the “ECNEC”) in its meeting held on 
12.11.2007 directed all procurement agencies of the Federal, Provincial 
and Local Governments throughout Pakistan to use SBDs prepared by 

5 
 
W. P. No. 23988 / 2022 
 
 
PEC. The decision was notified by the Planning Commission, Planning and 
Development Division, Government of Pakistan vide Notification No. 
8(6)WR/PC/2008 dated 12.02.2008. Since then, SBDs of PEC are being 
largely employed in the procurement process by the procuring agencies of 
the Federal, Provincial and Local Governments throughout Pakistan. 
However, lately the Authority in the Province of Punjab notified SBDs 
excluding insurance bond / guarantee from an insurance company having 
AA rating from PACRA / JCR as a permissible form of guarantee. Some 
Federal procuring agencies followed the Province of Punjab. This 
exclusion essentially ignited the dispute between the successful or lowest 
bidders and procuring agencies.   
6. 
 
The contentions of the Petitioners are that PEC has statutory 
mandate to develop and prescribe SBDs which have been made and since 
long are being used by all private and public stakeholders including all 
procuring agencies of the Federal, Provincial and Local Governments 
throughout Pakistan in all engineering contracts. The SBDs of PEC define 
‘performance security’ as ‘bank guarantee or any other security’ and as 
such, in addition to bank guarantee also allow tendering of securities in 
terms of performance security or additional performance security / quality 
assurance security in the shape of insurance bond / guarantee from 
insurance companies having AA rating from PACRA / JCR. The decision 
of ECNEC taken in its meeting dated 12.11.2007 and notified by the 
Planning Commission vide Notification dated 12.02.2008 mandatorily 
obligates all procuring agencies of Federal, Provincial and Local 
Governments throughout Pakistan to use SBDs of PEC. Hence, no 
procuring agency can prepare and float SBDs with variations from those 
prepared by PEC and mandated by ECNEC. Accordingly, the lowest or 
successful bidders are vested with a legal right to submit securities as per 
Clause 10.1 of the SBDs of PEC at their option in the form of either (a) 
bank guarantee from any Scheduled Bank in Pakistan or (b) bank guarantee 
from a bank located outside Pakistan duly counter-guaranteed by a 
Scheduled Bank in Pakistan or (c) an insurance company having at least 
AA rating from PACRA / JCR. Therefore, the Respondents by excluding 

6 
 
W. P. No. 23988 / 2022 
 
 
insurance bond / guarantee from SBDs floated by them are in breach of 
statutory command of the PEC Act and the decision of ECNEC. The 
Petitioners further state that the act of the Respondents to exclude 
insurance bond / guarantee in the SBDs offends the non-discrimination 
guarantee accorded to the Petitioners under Article 25 of the Constitution 
of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”) and is also 
against Rule 32 of the Rules, 2004 and Rule 34 of the Rules, 2014 which 
stipulate that save as otherwise provided, no procuring agency shall 
introduce any condition which discriminates between bidders or which is 
difficult to meet and in ascertaining the discriminatory or difficult nature of 
any condition, reference shall be made to the ordinary practices of that 
trade, manufacturing, construction business or service to which that 
particular procurement is related. Reliance is also placed on an unreported 
decision dated 04.10.2022 of Single Bench of this Court in W.P. No. 72544 
/ 2021 in case titled “M/s RMS Pvt. Ltd. v. Govt. of the Punjab & others” 
to support the contentions stated above in which deviation from SBDs of 
PEC was termed as unlawful with respect to exclusion of insurance bond / 
guarantee by a procuring agency in the Province of Punjab, 
notwithstanding that the decision for now has been suspended by a 
Division Bench of this Court. Hence, it is asserted that the successful or 
lowest bidders are entitled to give performance or additional performance / 
quality assurance securities through an insurance bond / guarantee from an 
insurance company apart from bank guarantee. 
7. 
 
Learned Law Officers and learned counsels for the 
Respondents submit that SBDs of PEC are not mandatory for the procuring 
agencies of the Federal, Provincial and Local Governments as PEC Act 
does not proclaim as such and is enacted to regulate engineering 
profession. SBDs of PEC merely serve as a benchmark for engineering 
contracts. The directions of ECNEC notified vide letter dated 12.12.2008 
by the Planning Commission requiring all procuring agencies to use SBDs 
of PEC are in the nature of general advice which do not preempt or 
override express statutory provisions applicable to Federal or Provincial 
procuring agencies. Even otherwise, the decision of ECNEC in no way 

7 
 
W. P. No. 23988 / 2022 
 
 
curtails the powers of a procuring agency to prescribe or exclude a 
particular form of guarantee as the same is permissible under the SBDs of 
PEC. Further, Clause 10.1 of the particular Conditions of SBDs of PEC 
requires submission of securities ‘at the option of bidders’ from the 
permissible forms of securities prescribed by the procuring agencies. 
Initially, SBDs framed by PEC were adopted and notified at the Federal 
level as the Authority under the PPRA Act, 2009 had not yet framed its 
own SBDs which allowed submission of securities through various modes 
including insurance bond / guarantee from an insurance company. 
However, as the subject of procurement does not figure in the Federal 
Legislative List under the Constitution, each Province is competent to 
legislate on this subject of procurement and has accordingly, put in place 
its own legislative frame-work including the Province of Punjab. Thus, the 
Federal legislative frame-work does not extend to or apply to the Provinces 
any more. Initially, such directions were followed in the Province of 
Punjab but after the promulgation of the PPRA Act, 2009 followed by the 
Rules, 2014, the Authority in compliance of statutory command has 
devised its own SBDs which have also been notified by the Department of 
Finance, Government of Punjab. Therefore, the directions of ECNEC 
contained in the letter dated 12.12.2008 on the administrative side have lost 
their relevance and no longer apply in the Province of Punjab. Even 
otherwise, National Economic Council or ECNEC under Article 156 of the 
Constitution has restricted general advisory mandate in terms of policy 
matters which does not extend to micro-manage the procurement process 
of a procuring agency existing under the Federal or Provincial 
Governments who under their applicable laws are free to prescribe the 
acceptable forms of guarantees to secure their funds which in essence is in 
line with the decision of ECNEC relied upon by the Petitioners. Such right 
of a procuring agency in the case of National Highway Authority has been 
recognized by the Division Bench of the High Court of Sindh in C.P. No. 
D-2779 / 2023 in case titled, “Nisar Ahmed Khan v. National Highway 
Authority and others” decided on 03.08.2023. Therefore, the procurement 
process at the Federal and Provincial levels is required to be undertaken 

8 
 
W. P. No. 23988 / 2022 
 
 
strictly in conformity with the applicable particular legislative frame-work 
which does not prohibit the exclusion of insurance bond / guarantee as a 
form of security. Discrimination between bidders is required to be assessed 
with respect to a particular procurement process and has no nexus with 
different procurement processes. Moreover, the procurement process 
between the procuring agency and a contractor is based on mutual 
contractual obligations and any interference in constitutional jurisdiction is 
unwarranted especially when the bidders in a particular procurement take 
part in accordance with the terms and conditions of SBDs floated by a 
procuring agency. Therefore, the act of exclusion of insurance bond / 
guarantee from the permissible forms of securities by the procuring 
agencies is a conscious policy decision within their lawful domain in order 
to prevent public funds from being misused and to ensure that the tendered 
security can be realized in a timely manner in the event of default in 
performance of contract. As such, the impugned action is liable to be 
sustained. 
8. 
 
From the rival contentions of the parties, the moot point 
requiring determination by this Court is as to whether the act of procuring 
agencies falling under the ambit of the Federal Government and the 
Provincial Government of Punjab to exclude insurance bond / guarantee 
from insurance companies as a form of security with respect to 
performance or additional performance / quality assurance security is 
lawful under the applicable procurement laws and the SBDs of PEC 
endorsed by ECNEC and notified by the Planning Commission, 
Government of Pakistan. 
9. 
 
In order to examine the moot point, it would be beneficial to 
first explore the mandate of the PEC Act. It has been enacted with the 
primary objective to regulate engineering profession with the vision that it 
may function as a key driving force for achieving rapid and sustainable 
growth in all national, economic and social fields. The PEC Act in terms of 
Section 3 thereof establishes PEC as its primary instrumentality to achieve 
its objects. PEC is responsible to set and maintain realistic and 
internationally relevant standards of professional competence and ethics for 

9 
 
W. P. No. 23988 / 2022 
 
 
engineers. PEC is vested with statutory mandate to license engineers and 
engineering institutions to ensure that they may competently and 
professionally promote and uphold standards. As such, PEC covers the 
entire spectrum of engineering disciplines and functions as an apex body to 
encourage and promote the pursuit of excellence in engineering profession. 
It is tasked to regulate the quality of engineering education and the practice 
of engineering in order to promote rapid growth in economic and social 
fields in Pakistan. Section 2(xxv) of the PEC Act defines “professional 
engineering work” as giving of professional advice and opinions, the 
making of measurements and layouts, the preparation of reports, 
computations, designs, drawings, plans and specifications and the 
construction, inspection and supervision of engineering works, in respect of 
matters stipulated in clauses (a) to (j) thereof. One such matter listed in 
clause (i) thereof, includes preparing SBDs or contract documents, 
construction cost data, conciliation and arbitration procedures, guidelines 
for bid evaluation, prequalification and price adjustments for construction 
and consultancy contracts. Section 8 thereof lists the functions of PEC and 
one such function specified in clause (p) thereof, pertains to establishing 
standards for engineering contracts, cost and services, whereas, clause (l) 
thereof, relates to assistance to the Federal Government as a Think Tank.  
10. 
 
It is abundantly clear from an overview of PEC Act that its 
domain, scope and ambit is limited vis-à-vis regulation of various aspects 
of engineering profession and for matters ancillary thereto. The SBDs 
prepared by PEC in pursuit and in furtherance of engineering profession 
may be adopted by any public or private entity as there is no bar in using or 
consulting the same and may validly be regarded as benchmark for 
engineering contracts. However, the SBDs prepared by PEC are not 
sacrosanct and as such, the parties to a contract cannot be forced or 
compelled to adopt the same, if they choose any other SBDs with respect to 
their respective contracts. Hence, the procuring agencies of Federal, 
Provincial and Local Governments are not legally bound to adopt and 
adhere to the SBDs prepared by PEC under the PEC Act. Similarly, if the 
same are adopted by any public procuring agency, the latter is free to make 

10 
 
W. P. No. 23988 / 2022 
 
 
amendments thereto in accordance with their peculiar requirements subject 
to applicable law. Therefore, the argument that since SBDs prepared by 
PEC allow tendering of securities by the bidders through insurance bond / 
guarantee, therefore, public procuring agencies are precluded to exclude 
the same from permissible forms of securities is misconceived. 
11. 
 
At the heart of the controversy is the decision of ECNEC 
dated 12.11.2007 notified on 12.02.2008 by the Planning Commission, 
Government of Pakistan. In order to examine the legal impact and effect of 
the decision of ECNEC, it is imperative to examine the dictate of Article 
156 of the Constitution which is reproduced as under:- 
“156. (1) The President shall constitute a National Economic 
Council which shall consist of— 
(a) the Prime Minister, who shall be the Chairman of 
the Council; 
(b) the Chief Ministers and one member from each 
Province to be nominated by the Chief Minister; and 
(c) four other members as the Prime Minister may 
nominate from time to time. 
(2) 
The National Economic Council shall review the overall 
economic condition of the country and shall, for advising the 
Federal Government and the Provincial Governments, 
formulate plans in respect of financial, commercial, social and 
economic policies; and in formulating such plans it shall, 
amongst other factors, ensure balanced development and 
regional equity and shall also be guided by the Principles of 
Policy set out in Chapter 2 of Part-II. 
(3) 
The meetings of the Council shall be summoned by the 
Chairman or on a requisition made by one-half of the 
members of the Council. 
(4) 
The Council shall meet at least twice in a year and the 
quorum for a meeting of the Council shall be one-half of its 
total membership. 
(5) 
The Council shall be responsible to the Majlis-e-Shoora 
(Parliament) and shall submit an Annual Report to each 
House of Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament).” 
 
12. 
 
It is evident from bare perusal of Article 156 of the 
Constitution that the scope and mandate of National Economic Council is 
to review the general and overall economic conditions of the country and 
formulate plans regarding financial, commercial, social and economic 
policies with the primary objective to ensure balanced and sustainable 

11 
 
W. P. No. 23988 / 2022 
 
 
development keeping in view regional equity in accordance with the 
principle of policy set out in Chapter 2 of Part-II of the Constitution. In this 
respect, it renders advice to the Federal and Provincial Governments. 
ECNEC is the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council to 
swiftly transact the business of National Economic Council. Rule 22 of the 
Rules of Business, 1973 (the “Rules of Business”) as amended up to 01st 
December, 2021 stipulates the procedure regarding the functioning of 
ECNEC. Rule 22(5) thereof proclaims that members of ECNEC shall be 
appointed by the Prime Minister and its terms of reference shall be notified 
by the Cabinet Division with the approval of the Prime Minister. Vide 
Notification No. F.5/2/2018-Com dated 22.09.2021, the Prime Minister in 
terms of Rule 22(5) of the Rules of Business approved the terms of 
reference of ECNEC as under:- 
“(i) 
To consider and decide accordingly, Public Sector 
Development Program Schemes (Federal / Provincial), 
according to Sanctioning limits approved by the 
National Economic Council (NEC) and notified / issued 
by Ministry of Planning, Development and Special 
Initiatives from time to time; 
(ii) 
To allow changes, as deemed appropriate in plans 
initiated by the Planning Commission / Ministry of 
Planning, Development and Special Initiatives; 
(iii) 
To review policy issues relating to development projects 
/ programs / plans before submission to the National 
Economic Council.” 
 
13. 
 
Thus, ECNEC, inter alia, is fully competent to render general 
policy advice and recommend measures qua spending of public funds and 
mode of execution of development works of the Federal and Provincial 
Governments. Record shows that a summary dated 06.11.2007 was 
submitted by the Planning Commission on “PEC Standard Bidding / 
Contract Documents”, wherein, the proposal contained in paragraph No. 14 
thereof was approved by ECNEC in its meeting held on 12.11.2007 as 
under:- 
“Approved the revised standard form of bidding/ contract 
documents listed in para 2 of Summary, prepared by Pakistan 
Engineering Council (PEC) for notification. 

12 
 
W. P. No. 23988 / 2022

15. 
 
Later, another Notification No. F.No.1(780)PP&H/PC/2007/ 
Vol-II dated 24.12.2009 was also issued by the Physical Planning & 
Housing Section of Planning and Development Division, Government of 
Pakistan regarding implementation of revised SBDs of PEC, the text of 
which is reproduced as under:- 
“1. 
The Prime Minister of Pakistan constituted a two 
member committee comprising Secretary, Ministry of Housing 
and Works and Member (Implementation & Monitoring), 
Planning Commission to review the proposals made by a 
delegation of APCA in a meeting held with the Prime Minister 
of Pakistan on 7th May, 2008 and submit recommendations for 
consideration of the ECC. 
2. 
A series of meetings were held under the chairmanship 
of Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Works with all the 
Stakeholders. In the 3rd Meeting of Deliberation Committee 
held on 31st March, 2009 in the Committee Room of Ministry 
of Housing & Works, Pak Secretariat, Islamabad, the 
following decision was taken with reference to the 
implementation of PEC Standard Form of Bidding/ Contract 
Documents:- 
“The dead line of 1st July, 2009 has been fixed for the 
departments to adopt the PEC bidding documents 
failing which Planning Commission and Finance 
Division shall not make the releases.” 
3. 
Planning Commission vide letter No.8(60)WR/PC/2008 
dated 12th February, 2008 has already circulated the Decision 
of ECNEC taken in its meeting held on 12th November, 2007 
on the subject matter. 
4. 
Besides, Planning Commission has requested the 
Ministries / Divisions and the Provincial Governments vide 
letter of even number dated 23rd February, 2009 to apprise 
about the implementation status in this regard. 
5. 
It is once again requested that Implementation status on 
the “Revised PEC Standard Bidding/ Contract Documents” 
for each and every project under execution in your Ministry/ 

14 
 
W. P. No. 23988 / 2022 
 
 
Division as well as respective Province be intimated to this 
Division by 10th January, 2010. 
6. 
The matter may be accorded priority, please.” 
16. 
 
There is no cavil to the proposition that ECNEC acted within 
its constitutional mandate in terms of rendering policy advice to the 
Federal, Provincial and Local Governments to adopt and adhere to the 
SBDs prepared by PEC in order to ensure that public funds are spent in a 
fair and transparent manner and arbitrary stipulations in the terms and 
conditions of contracts can be eliminated. However, it is settled law that 
decisions taken on the administrative side cannot override or prevail over 
express provisions of law. Further, the essence of the decision of ECNEC 
is to substantially adopt the SBDs of PEC but it does not prohibit minor 
alterations thereto by a procuring agency within its lawful mandate to meet 
peculiar requirements of a procuring agency. In order to ascertain the true 
impact and spirit of advice rendered by ECNEC, it is expedient to review 
the applicable procurement laws of the procuring agencies falling under the 
purview of the Federal Government and the Provincial Government of the 
Province of Punjab, respectively.   
17. 
 
Public procurement at the Federal level is governed under the 
PPRA Ordinance, 2002 which provides for the establishment of the 
Authority for regulating procurement of goods, services and works in the 
public sector. Section 1(2) of the PPRA Ordinance, 2002 extends its 
application to the whole of Pakistan. Section 2(j) thereof, defines procuring 
agency as any Ministry, Division, Department or any Office of the Federal 
Government or any authority, corporation, body or organization established 
by or under a Federal law or which is owned or controlled by the Federal 
Government. Section 3 of the PPRA Ordinance, 2002 sets up the Authority 
while Section 5 thereof stipulates the functions and powers of the 
Authority. Section 26 thereof provides that the Federal Government may, 
by notification in the official Gazette, make rules for carrying out its 
purposes, whereas, Section 27 thereof confers the power upon the 
Authority to make regulations, not inconsistent with the provisions of the 

15 
 
W. P. No. 23988 / 2022 
 
 
PPRA Ordinance, 2002 and the rules made thereunder. The Rules, 2004 
were accordingly, made by the Federal Government.  
18. 
 
Rule 23 of the Rules, 2004 relates to bidding documents. It 
stipulates that procuring agencies shall formulate precise and unambiguous 
bidding documents that shall be made available to the bidders immediately 
after the publication of the invitation to bid. It lists bidding documents in 
competitive bidding, whether open or limited. It imposes an obligation 
upon the procuring agency to transmit any necessary information after the 
invitation to bid or issue of the bidding documents to the prospective 
bidders including information qua any such change, addition, modification 
or deletion. It further, importantly, obligates that procuring agencies shall 
use SBDs as and when notified by regulations made by the Authority with 
the stipulation that bidding documents already in use of procuring agencies 
may be retained in their respective usage to the extent, they are not 
inconsistent with the Rules, 2004 and till such time that the SBDs are made 
by regulations. Rule 39 thereof regarding performance guarantee stipulates 
that where needed and clearly expressed in the bidding documents, the 
procuring agency shall require the successful bidder to furnish a 
performance guarantee which shall not exceed ten per cent of the contract 
amount.  
19. 
 
The Authority in exercise of its powers conferred under 
Section 27 of the PPRA Ordinance, 2002 has framed the Regulations, 
2008. Regulation 3 thereof stipulates that a procuring agency when 
engaged in procurement of works shall use the SBDs prescribed by PEC 
constituted under the PEC Act. It, therefore, follows that the Federal legal 
frame-work qua procurement in terms of Rule 23 of the Rules, 2004 vests 
the ultimate power to devise SBDs upon the Authority through the 
regulations, however, the Authority instead of devising and developing 
SBDs on its own requires a procuring agency to use the SBDs made by 
PEC in terms of Regulation 3 of the Regulations, 2008. 
20. 
 
This essentially requires to glance through the SBDs of PEC 
and the one for procurement of civil works dated 11.06.2007 is taken as an 
example. The Section regarding ‘Instructions to Users’ acknowledges the 

16 
 
W. P. No. 23988 / 2022 
 
 
right of a procuring agency to make appropriate changes in the Section 
‘Bidding Data’ and ‘Particular Conditions of Contract’. Clause 32.1 of 
Section ‘Instructions to Bidders’ is titled as ‘Performance Security’. It 
stipulates that the successful bidder shall furnish to the employer a 
performance security in the form and the amount stipulated in the ‘Bidding 
Data’ and the ‘Conditions of Contract’ within a period of 28 days after the 
receipt of Letter of Acceptance. Section ‘Bidding Data’ allows the 
‘employer’ to fill in the ‘Bidding Data’ before issuance of bidding 
documents in order to complement, amend or supplement the provisions in 
the ‘Instructions to Bidders’ and provides that where there is a conflict, the 
provisions contained in ‘Bidding Data’ shall prevail over those in the 
‘Instructions to Bidders’. Clause 32.1 under Section ‘Bidding Data’ gives 
an option to the ‘employer’ to select kind of performance security out of 
bank guarantee and / or bond and indicate the amount of performance 
security. Clause 10.1 of Part I of the ‘General Conditions of Contract’ 
(which is generally not permissible to be altered) pertains to performance 
security and permits the employer to seek performance security from the 
contractor in the required form and amount within a period of 28 days after 
the receipt of Letter of Acceptance. It does not mention any form of 
security. This is followed by Clause 10.1 contained in Part II – ‘Particular 
Conditions of Contract’ relating to performance security which is relied 
upon by the Petitioners and as such, is reproduced as under:- 
“The Contractor shall provide Performance Security to the 
Employer in the prescribed form. The said Security shall be 
furnished or caused to be furnished by the Contractor within 
28 days after the receipt of the Letter of Acceptance. The 
Performance Security shall be of an amount equal to 10% of 
the Contract Price stated in the Letter of Acceptance. Such 
Security shall, at the option of the bidder, be in the form of 
either (a) bank guarantee from any Scheduled Bank in 
Pakistan or (b) bank guarantee from a bank located outside 
Pakistan duly counter-guaranteed by a Scheduled Bank in 
Pakistan or (c) an insurance company having at least AA 
rating from PACRA/JCR.  
The cost of complying with requirements of this Sub-Clause 
shall be borne by the Contractor.”    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Emphasis Supplied)

W. P. No. 23988 / 2022 
 
 
 
21. 
 
It is manifestly evident from conjunctive and collective 
reading of the SBDs of PEC that the ‘employer’ can exercise its discretion 
to opt for bank guarantee only by excluding insurance bond / guarantee as a 
form of security through the ‘Bidding Data’ and ‘Particular Conditions of 
Contract’. As such, ‘Bidding Data’ and Clause 10.1 of Part II – ‘Particular 
Conditions of Contract’ relating to performance security can be 
appropriately amended to exclude insurance bond / guarantee as a form of 
security as was done by the Respondents. The bidders can only exercise 
their option out of the prescribed form of security by the ‘employer’. This 
was precisely held in Nasir Ahmed Khan case (supra) that the discretion to 
choose the form of performance guarantee vests with the procuring agency 
under the SBDs of PEC. Consequently, a Federal procuring agency can 
validly exclude insurance bond / guarantee as form of security against 
performance or additional performance / quality assurance security by 
exercising its discretion through the ‘Bidding Data’ and Clause 10.1 of 
‘Particular Conditions of Contract’ while using SBDs of PEC.   
22. 
 
The conjunctive reading of the PPRA Ordinance, 2002, the 
Rules, 2004 and the Regulations, 2008 lead to the conclusion that the 
ultimate power to make SBDs has been conferred upon the Authority, 
however, until the same are made or notified, the procuring agencies within 
the framework of the Federal Government have been obligated to use 
SBDs prescribed by PEC. As such, the current legal framework of 
procurement at the Federal level is in line with the decision of ECNEC, 
although the Authority by exercising the powers to develop SBDs 
conferred upon it, may validly make SBDs on its own by amending 
Regulation 3 of Regulations, 2008. Therefore, at present, all procuring 
agencies operating within the domain of the Federal Government are 
obligated to undertake procurement of goods, services and works in 
accordance with the SBDs prescribed by PEC. However, as noted above, 
the exclusion of insurance bond / guarantee as a form of guarantee by a 
Federal procuring agency is permissible under the SBDs of PEC and an 
such, the impugned action is compatible with the decision of ECNEC. 

18 
 
W. P. No. 23988 / 2022 
 
 
23. 
 
The Province of Punjab promulgated the PPRA Act, 2009 
with the objective to regulate the procurement of goods, services and works 
in the public sector. Section 2(l) thereof defines ‘procuring agency’ as a 
department, attached department of the Government, an autonomous body 
or a special institution of the Government, a court or tribunal financed by 
the Provincial Consolidated Fund, Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, a 
Local Government, a body corporate owned or controlled by the 
Government or a Local Government or a private organization financed by 
the Government or a Local Government where such finance is not less than 
five million rupees and constitutes not less than fifty percent of the 
expenditure of the organization in the financial year. Similarly, Section 
2(n) of the PPRA Act, 2009 defines ‘public procurement’ as procurement 
of goods, works or services by a procuring agency wholly or partly 
financed out of the Provincial Consolidated Fund or the Public Account of 
the Province or funds of a procuring agency. Section 3 of the PPRA Act, 
2009 constitutes the Authority whose functions and powers are stipulated 
in Section 5 thereof. Importantly, Section 5(2)(h) thereof specifically 
confers power upon the Authority to prepare SBDs to be used in 
connection with public procurement in contrast to the PPRA Ordinance, 
2002 where such specific power is conspicuously absent but is provided in 
the Rules, 2004 to be exercised through regulations. Section 26 of the 
PPRA Act, 2009 confers rule making powers upon the Government while 
Section 27 thereof confers the power of making regulations upon the 
Authority subject to the provisions of PPRA Act, 2009 and the rules made 
thereunder. The Government of Punjab, accordingly, framed the Rules, 
2014.  
24. 
 
Rule 2(w) of the Rules, 2014 defines ‘performance guarantee’ 
as the bank guarantee or other form of security submitted by the contractor 
to secure obligations under the contract in accordance with the requirement 
in the bidding document. Rule 25 thereof pertains to bidding documents 
which proclaims that a procuring agency shall formulate precise and 
unambiguous bidding documents that shall be made available to the 
bidders immediately after the publication of the invitation to bid. This Rule 

19 
 
W. P. No. 23988 / 2022 
 
 
also stipulates bidding documents for competitive bidding, whether open or 
limited. It further obligates that necessary information after invitation of 
bid or issuance of bidding documents must be provided to the prospective 
bidders in a timely manner and on equal opportunity basis including any 
changes made to the original advertisement. It further states that a 
procuring agency shall use SBDs as and when notified under the 
regulations with the stipulation that until the SBDs are so specified under 
the regulations, a procuring agency may use SBDs already in use of the 
procuring agency to the extent they are not inconsistent with the Rules, 
2014. Rule 56 thereof relates to performance guarantee and declares that 
where needed and clearly expressed in the bidding documents, the 
procuring agency shall require the successful bidder to furnish a 
performance guarantee which shall not exceed ten percent of the contract 
amount. 
25. 
 
The Authority in exercise of its powers conferred under 
Section 27 of the PPRA Act 2009 read with Rule 25(5) of the Rules, 2014 
framed SBDs vide notification No. MD(PPRA)46-BOM/2022 dated 
27.10.2022 as regulations which have also been uploaded on its website. 
SBDs for procurement of civil works developed by the Authority regarding 
Single Stage - Two Envelopes Bidding Procedure is taken as an example. 
In its preface, it is clearly stipulated that this template for SBDs for civil 
works has been formulated and prepared to assist in successful bidding of 
the civil works for which design / resident consultants may be required as 
per framework issued by the Planning & Development Department, 
Government of Punjab vide letter No. 4(24)PO(CONS)P&D/97-Vol-III, 
dated 27.07.2017. It further proclaims that the principle of “value for 
money” remained the guiding spirit and ultimate object of this endeavor.  It 
acknowledges that while developing SBDs by the Authority, the 
documents prepared by PEC were also extensively considered. All 
procuring agencies in the Province of Punjab are required to use SBDs 
while preparing and finalizing the SBDs and allows a procuring agency to 
include other details, as per requirement of the procuring agencies, as far as 
they are not inconsistent with the PPRA Act, 2009 and the Rules, 2014 

20 
 
W. P. No. 23988 / 2022 
 
 
with the caveat that in case of any conflict between the provisions of SBDs 
with that of PPRA Act, 2009 and the Rules, 2014, the latter two shall 
prevail.  
26. 
 
Clause 32.1 of Bid Data sheet thereof pertains to the amount 
and form of securities with respect to performance security acceptable to 
the employer. It gives options to the bidders to tender securities of various 
amounts in the form of bank guarantee but specifically excludes any 
security from insurance companies. This exclusion has been consciously 
and purposely made by the Authority as the said security was not 
considered tangible having not being honored in a timely manner as per 
past experiences and as such, losing the purpose of security. Clause 10.1 of 
SBDs has been accordingly prescribed which reads as under:- 
 
 
“Performance Security 
The Contractor shall provide Performance Security to the 
Employer in the prescribed form. The said Security shall be 
furnished or caused to be furnished by the Contractor within 
30 days after the receipt of the Letter of Acceptance. The 
Performance Security shall be of an amount equal to 10% of 
the Contract Price stated in the Letter of Acceptance. Such 
Security shall, at the option of the bidder, be in the form of 
either (a) bank guarantee from any Scheduled Bank in 
Pakistan or (b) bank guarantee from a bank located outside 
Pakistan duly counter-guaranteed by a Scheduled Bank in 
Pakistan.” 
 
27. 
 
It follows from the above that the Authority in exercise of its 
lawful powers under the PPRA Act, 2009 read with the Rules, 2014 has 
developed SBDs for use of all procuring agencies including Local 
Governments in the Province of Punjab which exclude insurance bond / 
guarantee from an insurance company as a form of security. Thus, in the 
context of the Province of Punjab, the decision of ECNEC dated 
12.11.2007 and Notification of the Planning Commission, Government of 
Pakistan dated 12.02.2008 to use SBDs of PEC has lost its relevance as 
express provisions of law preempt an administrative decision. However, it 
is reiterated that even otherwise exclusion of insurance bond / guarantee 
from an insurance company as a form of guarantee is not in conflict with 
the decision of ECNEC as SBDs of PEC also permit the same. The 

21 
 
W. P. No. 23988 / 2022 
 
 
directions of ECNEC to use SBDs of PEC, in essence, requires the use of 
standard contracts in the procurement process which purpose has been 
achieved by the Authority under the PPRA Act, 2009.  
28. 
 
The upshot of the above discussion is that exclusion of 
insurance bond / guarantee as a form of security by the procuring agencies 
of the Federal Government and the Provincial Government of Punjab with 
respect to performance or additional performance / quality assurance 
guarantee is permissible in terms of lawful discretion of a procuring agency 
provided it is specifically stated in the SBDs. The bidders who participate 
in the bidding process, subject to bidding documents, have no vested right 
to tender securities in a particular form of their choice that is not part of the 
SBDs of a procuring agency as they knowingly participate in a bidding 
process in accordance with the terms and conditions of the SBDs. 
Moreover, as exclusion of insurance bond / guarantee indiscriminately 
applies to all bidders with reference to a particular bidding process, no case 
of discrimination is made out. The objection qua exercise of constitutional 
jurisdiction with respect to contractual matters is overruled as it is well 
settled that where facts emanating from contractual disputes are admitted, 
constitutional jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution can be 
exercised.   
29. 
 
From the above analyses, the following conclusions are 
drawn:-  
(i) 
PEC under the PEC Act cannot mandatorily require a public 
procuring agency to follow its SBDs; 
(ii) 
The general policy advice of ECNEC reflected in the 
Notification dated 12.02.2008 of the Planning Commission, 
Government of Pakistan requiring all procuring agencies of 
the Federal, Provincial and Local Governments throughout 
Pakistan to adopt and use SBDs prepared by PEC does not 
prevail over express statutory provisions; 
(iii)  At the Federal level, the Authority constituted under the PPRA 
Ordinance, 2002 read with PPRA Rules, 2004 and the 
Regulations, 2008 is legally empowered to devise SBDs but it 

22 
 
W. P. No. 23988 / 2022 
 
 
has adopted the SBDs prepared by PEC and as such, all 
procuring agencies falling under the Federal Government are 
obliged to use the SBDs of PEC in their respective 
procurement process. However, SBDs of PEC allow a 
procuring agency to exclude insurance bond / guarantee from 
an insurance company having AA rating from PACRA / JCR 
as a form of security with respect to performance or additional 
performance / quality assurance security by prescribing as 
such in its SBDs;   
(iv) 
In the Province of Punjab, the Authority set up under the 
PPRA Act, 2009 read with the Rules, 2014 is legally 
empowered to devise SBDs which have been duly made and 
notified, as such, all procuring agencies including Local 
Governments in the Province of Punjab are obliged to use 
SBDs prepared by the Authority under the PPRA Act, 2009. 
Hence, the conscious act of exclusion of insurance bond / 
guarantee from an insurance company as a form of security 
with respect to performance or additional performance / 
quality assurance security is valid and the bidders are obliged 
to take part in the procurement process in accordance with the 
terms and conditions of the SBDs; and  
(v) 
The act of exclusion of insurance bond / guarantee as a form 
of security with respect to performance or additional 
performance / quality assurance security by a procuring 
agency falling under the Federal or Provincial Government of 
Punjab is not in conflict with the decision of ECNEC reflected 
in the Notification dated 12.02.2008 of the Planning 
Commission, Government of Pakistan.    
 
30. 
 
The titled and connected Petitions are decided in the terms 
incorporated in Paragraph No. 29 of this Judgment. The Respondents / 
procuring agencies are directed to issue fresh notice to each Petitioner to 
furnish security in the requisite amount and form mentioned in the 

23 
 
W. P. No. 23988 / 2022 
 
 
applicable SBDs in all pending contracts within a period of 28 days from 
the date of issuance of notice, failing which each Petitioner may be dealt 
with in accordance with the terms and conditions of applicable contract. 
Disposed of, accordingly.
