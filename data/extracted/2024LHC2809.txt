JUDGMENT 
 
 
Date of hearing 
 
07.05.2024 
Petitioner by 
 
Mr. Mehmood A Sheikh, learned 
Advocate. 
Respondent No. 
1 by 
Sardar Liaqat Ali Dogar, learned 
Advocate. 
 
 
 
SULTAN TANVIR AHMAD, J:– Through 
present petition, filed under Article 199 of the Constitution 
of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the petitioner has 
challenged order dated 18.02.2022 passed by learned Judge 
Family Court, Lahore. 
2.  
The necessary facts, required to decide the 
present petition, are that respondent No. 1 instituted a suit 
dated 01.04.2021 (the „suit‟) for recovery of certain articles 
raising allegations that his parents gave gold ornaments, 
clothes and some other articles at the time of marriage, 
which were received by the petitioner and the same are in 
her possession that she shifted to the house of her parents 
and now the same have been refused to be returned. The 
petitioner 
raised 
preliminary 
objection 
regarding 
maintainability of the suit that barri or gifts articles given to 

 
 
W.P. No. 29490-2022                                                                   2 
 
the bride at the time of marriage are the property of the bride 
in addition to dowry articles by virtue of law, therefore, 
recovery of the same from bride is not permissible. On 
18.02.2022, the learned Family Court, Lahore rejected the 
objection raised by the petitioner and reached to the 
following conclusion:- 
“…As far as the objection that who is entitled 
to claim the recovery of bridal gifts is the 
matter of evidence as both husband and wife in 
these suits are claimant against each other and 
without providing opportunity to lead the 
evidence, the controversy cannot be resolved. 
So, in view of above discussion, the objections 
raised by learned counsel for the defendant on 
the maintainability of instant suit are hereby 
turned down…” 
 
Being aggrieved from the same, present petition 
has been filed. 
3. 
Mr. Mahmood A. Sheikh, learned Senior-ASC 
has argued that the learned Family Court has ignored that 
the articles that are being claimed in the suit, by operation of 
law, absolutely vest in the petitioner. He has further argued 
that the suit has been filed merely to add to the agony of 
petitioner-lady, who has been subjected to torture during her 
stay at the house of respondent No. 1; that the learned 
Family Court has not correctly appreciated that continuation 
of the suit is totally fruitless besides being based on 
frivolous allegations. Learned counsel for the petitioner has 
added that the petitioner already went through trauma, 
distress and sufferings; that she was kept in confinement for 
a long duration by respondent No. 1 with the help of his 
close friend, who is a police officer and now respondent   
No. 1 just wants to maintain the suit to add in the miseries of 
the petitioner. 

 
 
W.P. No. 29490-2022                                                                   3 
 
4.  
Conversely, Sardar Liaqat Ali Dogar, learned 
counsel for respondent No. 1 has relied upon case titled 
“Mst. Nomail Zia Versus Adnan Riaz” (2014 CLC 87) and 
he has opposed this petition. He has argued that since both 
the parties have filed their respective claims, therefore, the 
questions raised by the petitioner cannot be decided without 
framing issues and recording evidence.  
5. 
  
Heard. 
 
6. 
  
Reading of plaint and the record makes it 
unequivocally clear that the claim of respondent  No. 1 is for 
recovery of articles which were allegedly given by the 
parents of respondent No. 1 to the petitioner at the time of 
marriage. In paragraph  No. 3 of the suit it is averred “… the 
parents of the plaintiff made Barri Articles in shape of gold 
ornaments, 
precious 
clothes 
and 
other 
necessary 
articles………which were duly received by the defendant 
and remained in her possession and use…”.  In subsequent 
paragraph it is categorically stated that “…the defendant was 
using the above said gold ornaments as per her wishes and 
kept the same with her.” As per the plaint, the grievance 
arose to respondent No. 1 when allegedly the articles were 
shifted by the petitioner to her parents. The cause of action, 
set-up in paragraph No. 12, is dominantly referring to 
articles received by respondent No. 1 at the time of marriage 
and then alleged failure to return the same. Examination of 
plaint, its prayer and the material on record, eliminates any 
doubt that the articles or ornaments claimed are covered 
under section 2(a) and 2(e) of the Dowry and Bridal Gifts 
(Restriction) Act, 1976 (the „Act of 1976‟), which reads as 
under:- 
“2(a)  “bridal gift” means any property given 
as a gift before, at or after the marriage, either 

 
 
W.P. No. 29490-2022                                                                   4 
 
directly or indirectly, by the bridegroom or his 
parents to the bride in connection with the 
marriage but does not include Mehr,” 
 
2(e)  “present” means a gift of any property 
not being a bridal gift or dowry, given before, 
at or after the marriage, either directly or 
indirectly, to either party to a marriage in 
connection with the marriage or to the relatives 
of the bride or bridegroom but does not include 
neundra and salami; 
 
 
  
Section 5 of the Act of 1976 provides that 
dowry, bridal gifts and property given to bride as present 
vest in the bride absolutely, in the following manners:- 
“5. 
Vesting of dowry etc., in the bride. All 
property given as dowry or bridal gifts and all 
property given to the bride as a present shall 
vest absolutely in the bride and her interest in 
property however derived shall hereafter not be 
restrictive, conditional or limited.” 
 
 
 
          (Emphasis Supplied) 
 
7. 
  
A learned Division Bench of Balochistan High 
Court in case titled “Tania Naseer vs. Muhammad Zubair 
and 2 others” (2017 YLR 1481) observed as under:- 
“11. The above Act clearly shows that the 
articles of dowry, bridal gifts, presents or all 
the other movable property are the belongings 
of bride. Furthermore, in the case of Ghulam 
Rasul v. Judge, Family Court 1991 CLC 1696, 
it is held that bridal gift given by husband is the 
absolute property of wife and it could not be 
snatched away from her.” 
This Court in case titled “Gul Sher vs. Mst. 
Maryam Sultana” (2011 YLR 1000) reached to the same 
conclusion and held:- 
“5. 
Even otherwise section 5 of the Dowry 
and Bridal Gifts (Restriction) Act, 1976 
provides that all property given as dowry or 
bridal gifts to a bride shall vest absolutely in 
her and that her interest in the said property, 

 
 
W.P. No. 29490-2022                                                                   5 
 
however derived shall not be restrictive, 
conditional or limited. In the said section, there 
is no limitation of Rs.5,000/- either for dowry 
or for wari. On the other hand, it has been 
provided therein that such property shall be 
owned by her absolutely and to the exclusion of 
the bridegroom without caring for the source 
through which it has come and without 
limitation of any amount. Therefore, it is quite 
clear that in spite of the restriction imposed in 
section 3, a bride is the owner of the dowry and 
wari articles irrespective of their value and she 
is entitled to retain it forever and to claim its 
return or the value thereof, if the same is kept 
back by her husband or any other person. In 
this regard I rely upon „Masud Sarwar v. Mst. 
Farah Deeba‟1988 CLC 1546 (Lahore).” 
 
 
 
          
(Underlining is added) 
 
8. 
  
The law on the point that the claimed property / 
articles unconditionally and absolutely vest in the petitioner 
is unambiguous and settled. The learned Family Court 
somehow observed that some issue is required to be settled 
and then resolved by recording evidence. Order XIV of 
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC) provides for 
settlement of issues and determination on issue of law or on 
issues agreed upon. Rule 1(2) of Order XIV of CPC requires 
material proposition of law or fact(s) to be alleged in the suit 
in order to show a right to sue. Issues are ought to be framed 
when a material proposition of fact or law is affirmed by one 
party and denied by the other. The facts in the suit are based 
on recovery of those articles that as per law cannot be 
recovered by the claimant and absolutely belongs to the 
defender of the suit. There is no proposition set-up in the 
suit that amounts to material proposition of law and fact, 
requiring determination or settlement. This Court in case 
titled “Gulistan Textile Mills Ltd. Vs. Askari Bank Ltd. and 
others” (2013 CLD 2005) emphasized that:-  

 
 
W.P. No. 29490-2022                                                                   6 
 
“7. 
Court enjoys an independent, suo motu 
and sua sponte power to examine the plaint at 
any stage of the suit under Order VII, Rule 11, 
C.P.C. The wisdom is that a Court can always, 
nip a frivolous suit in the bud, by rejecting the 
plaint in order to retain its docket and time for 
more serious claims. “In the first place it 
contemplates that a still-born suit should be 
properly buried, at its inception, so that no 
further time is consumed on a fruitless 
litigation. Secondly, it gives plaintiff a chance 
to retrace his steps, at the earliest possible 
moment, so that, if permissible under law, he 
may found a properly constituted case.” This 
power is grounded in good public policy. The 
Court enjoys an insular power under Order VII, 
Rule 11 to examine the plaint, primarily on the 
basis of the contents of the plaint. “The 
averments in the plaint are germane” and it 
does not matter to the Court if the defendants 
have been issued summons or applications for 
leave to defend or written statements have been 
filed by the defendants or even if the defendants 
are in Court to defend their positions. The 
Court can proceed unilaterally against the 
plaintiff alone without engaging the other party 
(defendants) if the Court is of the view that the 
plaint is liable to be rejected. This is the 
inherent power of the Court which precedes the 
statutory obligation of the court under section 
10(8) of the Ordinance. This nuance is 
fundamental to this case.”

The same guidelines were again issued in case 
titled “Ameer Abbas Sial vs. Province of Punjab” (2020 
CLC 792).  
9. 
 
In case titled “President, Zarai Taraqiati Bank 
Limited, Head Office, Islamabad vs. Kishwar Khan and 
others” (2022 SCMR 1598) the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
made it responsibility of the Courts to give meaningful 
reading to the plaint and when it is clear that suit is meritless 
and instead of disclosing a right to sue, as intended by 

 
 
W.P. No. 29490-2022                                                                   7 
 
legislature in the above discussed provisions of law, the suit 
is manifestly vexatious, the Courts can reject the plaint. The 
guidelines given in this regard are as follows:- 
“…The court is under obligation to must give a 
meaningful reading to the plaint and if it is 
manifestly vexatious or meritless in the sense of 
not disclosing a clear right to sue, the court 
may reject the plaint. With the aim of deciding 
whether the plaint discloses cause of action or 
not, the court has to perceive and grasp the 
averments made in the plaint and the 
accompanying documents. In case of any mix 
question 
of 
law 
and 
facts, 
the 
right 
methodology and approach is to let the suit 
proceed to written statement and discovery and 
determine the matter either on framing 
preliminary issues or regular trial. This Rule 
does not justify the rejection of any particular 
portion of the plaint or in piecemeal as the 
concept of partial rejection is seemingly 
incongruous to the provisions of Order VII, 
Rule 11 C.P.C. Astute drafting for creating 
illusions of cause of action are not permitted in 
law but a clear right to sue ought to be shown 
in the plaint. It is trite law that a party should 
not be unnecessarily harassed in a suit and if 
no cause of action is disclosed, the courts may 
not unnecessarily protract the hearing of a 
suit…”  
 
10. 
  
I have heard the two sides and carefully gone 
through the plaint as well as the relied documents and 
reached to the conclusion that there is no such cause 
disclosed in the suit that require further adjudication on any 
disputed proposition of law or fact. The claim in the suit is 
against the settled law. Its existence on the docket is not just 
fruitless rather wastage of time. The continuation of the 
same shall operate as oppressive and vexatious to the 
respondent. It appears that above settled law and criteria 
settled by the Supreme Court escaped view of learned 
Family Court. It has been apprised that suit for recovery 

 
 
W.P. No. 29490-2022                                                                   8 
 
filed by respondent No. 1 is already pending and if there is 
any dispute as to the possession of some of the articles, the 
relevant issue can be framed in the said suit and then 
resolved, if so required. 
11. 
  
For what has been discussed above, the present 
petition is allowed. The plaint in question is rejected. 
Respondent No. 1 shall pay Rs.25,000/- as cost. Six percent 
interest per annum shall be added to cost, if not paid within 
30 days from the date of announcement of this judgment.
