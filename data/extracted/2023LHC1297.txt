JUDGMENT. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
Mirza Viqas Rauf, J. This petition under section 115 of the 
Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908) (hereinafter referred to as “CPC”) 
stems out from the order dated 26th February, 2018, whereby the learned 
Additional District Judge, Rawalpindi, while dismissing the appeal preferred 
by the petitioners, affirmed the judgment and decree dated 19th February, 
2018 passed by the learned Civil Judge, Rawalpindi, resulting into dismissal 
of suit instituted by the petitioners, being not competent. Since suit instituted 
by the petitioners is dismissed while invoking the provisions of Order VII 
Rule 11 “CPC”, so leaving desultory details apart, only necessary facts are 
to be highlighted.  
2.  
Being the co-owner of the suit property, the petitioners instituted 
a suit for permanent injunction, which was resisted by Mehboob Khan, 
predecessor-in-interest of the respondents, who instead of submitting the 
written statement, moved an application under Order VII Rule 11 “CPC” on 
the ground that suit is barred by law and it is not maintainable. The 
application was though contested by the petitioners but it was accepted by 
way of order dated 19th February, 2018. Feeling aggrieved, the petitioners 
preferred an appeal before the learned Additional District Judge, 
Date of hearing: 
15.03.2023. 
Petitioners by: 
Sardar Asmat Ullah Khan, Advocate. 
Respondents by: 
Mirza Saqlain Abid, Advocate.

Rawalpindi but of no avail and the appeal was dismissed in limine through 
impugned order dated 26th February, 2018, hence this petition. 
3.  
On the first date of its presentation, the petition was admitted for 
regular hearing on 5th March, 2018 and thereafter by way of order dated 
24th November, 2021, following question was framed: - 
“As to whether a suit for injunction simpliciter inter-se co-
sharers/co-owners is proceedable or otherwise? 
4.  
Learned counsel for the petitioners, while addressing the above 
question, submitted that even a co-owner can institute a suit for injunction 
for the protection of his proprietary and possessory rights. He added that the 
petitioners have been non-suited on extraneous grounds. In support of his 
contentions, learned counsel has placed reliance on MUHAMMAD RAFIQ 
and others v. SARDAR and others (2004 SCMR 1036) and ALI GOHAR 
KHAN v. SHER AYAZ and others (1989 SCMR 130). 
5.  
Conversely, learned counsel for the “respondents” submitted that 
a co-sharer/co-owner is precluded to institute a suit for injunction and he 
has only a remedy to seek partition from the Court of law. It is added that 
findings of both the Courts below are concurrent and unexceptionable. 
Reliance to this effect is placed on AKHTAR NAWAZ KHAN, ETC. v. 
DANIAL KHAN, ETC. (NLR 1995 SCJ 169) and ASHIQ HUSSAIN v. Prof. 
MUHAMMAD ASLAM and 9 others (2004 MLD 1844). 
6.  
Heard. Record perused. 
7.  
The moot point involved in this case is as to whether a co-
sharer/co-owner can institute a suit for injunction for the protection of his 
rights without seeking partition. The above question, for the first time, came 
under discussion before Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of ALI 
GOHAR KHAN v. SHER AYAZ and others supra. The relevant extract from 
the same is reproduced below: - 
“6.  
The sole question which needs consideration in 
this case is whether in the facts and circumstances of the present 
suit a decree for perpetual injunction can be issued. As the 
record stands, the respondents had purchased a portion of the 
land from a joint Khata and dumped stones for raising 

3 
 
C.R.No.212-D of 2018 
 
 
construction over the same. The report of the Commissioner 
though may not be germane to the pleadings of the parties but is 
relevant to the extent that the suit property is jointly owned by the 
parties and no partition in any form has yet taken place. 
Furthermore, the fact that the property in suit is joint and no 
private partition amongst the parties has taken place stands 
finally decided by the Civil Judge vide his order dated 9-1-1975. 
Therefore, it can be said without any fear of contradiction that 
the parties are co-sharers in the suit property. The question now 
is whether a co-sharer in such a situation can deal with a joint 
property in the manner he likes without the express permission of 
other co-sharers and to their detriment. The answer obviously is 
in the negative as it is a settled principle of law that in case of 
joint immovable property each co-sharer is interested in every 
inch of the subject-matter irrespective of the quantity of his 
interest. A co-sharer thus will not be allowed to act in a manner 
which constitutes an invasion on the right of the other 
co-sharers. A co-sharer in possession of a portion of the joint 
property, therefore, cannot change the nature of the property in 
his possession unless partition takes place by metes and bounds. 
In the circumstances we think the learned District Judge was 
justified in law in passing a decree of perpetual injunction in 
favour of the appellant.” 
8.  
Latter in the case of AKHTAR NAWAZ KHAN, ETC. v. DANIAL 
KHAN, ETC. supra, a learned Bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
comprising of three Hon’ble Judges, with a majority view, held as under: - 
“There is no cavil with the proposition enunciated from 
time to time that every joint owner is interested in every inch of 
the joint property so long as partition by metes and bounds does 
not take place among the co-sharers and each individual co-
sharer is allotted his exclusive share and that every co-sharer has 
the right to stop the other co-sharers from changing the nature of 
the property to his detriment. It is equally well-established by now 
that every co-sharer in possession of the joint property to the 
extent of his share in the entire joint property has a right to make 
use of it in the manner he likes without hindrance by the other 
co-sharers and if they feel aggrieved by the conversion of the 
user by the co-sharers, their remedy is to go for the partition and 
get their share separated.” 
9.  
In the case of MUHAMMAD RAFIQ and others v. SARDAR and 
others supra, the Supreme Court of Pakistan, however, reiterated the 
principles laid down in the case of ALI GOHAR KHAN v. SHER AYAZ and 
others supra in the following manner: - 
“2. The dispute relates to inheritance of one Nawab. The 
respondents were admittedly his daughters whereas the present 
petitioners are his collaterals being heirs of his brother. It was 
held that after the death of Nawab, the land was inherited by his 
widow Mst. Hakam Bibi/mother of the respondents as limited 
owner and on the termination of her limited interest, the property 

4 
 
C.R.No.212-D of 2018 
 
 
devolved on the heirs of last male owner i.e. Nawab, under the 
Muslim Law. Since Nawab had not left any male heir therefore, 
his two daughters were declared to be the owners of the property 
by way of inheritance according to the shares allocated to them 
as daughters under the Mohammedan Law and the remaining 
property was inherited by the respondents as collaterals. These 
findings have been recorded by all the Courts below and we do 
not find any reason as to why the present petitioners have filed 
this petition. 
3.  
Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the 
only objection which the petitioners wanted to agitate was that 
since the respondents were not in possession of the property, 
therefore, the suit for mere declaration without prayer for 
consequential relief of possession was not maintainable. 
4.  
We are afraid, the argument is plainly unsound. The heirs 
of Nawab had become joint owners of the property after the 
termination of limited interest of Hakam Bibi therefore, it was a 
case of joint ownership and suit for declaration by one of the 
joint owners that they were also owners in the property which 
right was being denied to them, was maintainable. 
5.  
It was not necessary for any of the joint owners, to have 
claimed partition of the joint property at present as it could be 
claimed by any of the joint owners during the currency of joint 
ownership without limitation of any period in that behalf so long 
as the right of any of the joint owners was not denied which was 
not in dispute in this case.” 
10.  
The question framed hereinabove also came under discussion 
before this Court in the case of ASHIQ HUSSAIN v. Prof. MUHAMMAD 
ASLAM and 9 others supra and it was resolved as under: - 
“6. 
…Mere reading of aforesaid contents of the plaint 
clearly shows that petitioner has not impleaded all the co-sharers 
as defendants in the suit. Therefore, First Appellate Court was 
justified to non-suit the petitioner which is in accordance with 
the law laid down by the Honourable Supreme Court in Khaleeq 
Ahmad v. Abdul Ghani and others (PLD 1973 SC 214). The 
relevant observation is as under:  
"A suit for possession can be brought by all the co-
owners jointly. It is open however, to one of them also to 
sue for possession but he must join the other co-owners as 
defendants and the decree will be for joint possession and 
not in favour of the plaintiff only." 
The First Appellate Court was justified that suit of the petitioner 
was not maintainable against the other co-sharers except by 
bringing a suit for partition of joint property as the law laid down 
by the Division Bench of this Court in Muhammad Shafi's case 
(1979 CLC 230). The relevant observation is as follows:  
"There is thus ample authority for the proposition that if 
a co-sharer has been in exclusive possession of a certain 

5 
 
C.R.No.212-D of 2018 
 
 
portion of the joint property for a long period, he cannot 
be dispossessed therefrom by another co-sharer except by 
bringing a suit for partition of the joint property." 
The aforesaid judgment of the Division Bench of this Court was 
considered and approved by the Honourable Supreme Court in 
Mst. Resham Bibi's case (1999 SCMR 2325). The aforesaid 
provision of law is also supported by the law laid down in 
"Munshi and 2 others v. Muhammad Shafi and 30 others" (1966 
Law Notes (Lahore) 58). The First Appellate Court has reversed 
the finding of the trial Court after proper appreciation of 
evidence on record in First Appeal which is the prerogative of the 
First Appellate Court to reappraise the evidence as Appellate 
Court to come to his own conclusion on the basis of evidence 
adduced before the trial Court by the parties and resultantly he 
could competently reverse the finding of the trial Court on the 
question of fact in issues in question. The First Appellate Court 
has reversed the finding with cogent reasons after reappraisal of 
the evidence on record as is evident from para. No.8 of the 
impugned judgment. It is established proposition of law that 
findings on question of fact or law howsoever, erroneous the 
same may be recorded by a Court of competent jurisdiction 
cannot be interfered with by the High Court in exercise of its 
revisional jurisdiction under section 115, C.P.C. Unless such 
findings suffers from jurisdictional defect, illegality or material 
irregularity as per principle laid down by the Privy Council in 
N.S. Venkatagiri Ayyangar and another v. The Hindu Religious 
Endowments Board Madras (PLD 1949 Privy Council 26). The 
aforesaid judgment was considered and followed by this Court in 
Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education Lahore v. Syed 
Khalid Mahmood (1985 CLC 657) which is upheld by the 
Honourable Supreme Court in unreported judgment dated 31-3-
1985 passed in C.P. No.1146 of 1984. Learned counsel of the 
petitioner failed to point out any infirmity or illegality in the 
impugned judgment and also did not bring the case within the 
parameters prescribed by the Privy Council in the aforesaid 
judgment. 
11.  
The above view was further affirmed in the case of Mst. ROSHAN 
ARA BEGUM and 8 others v. MUHAMMAD BANARAS and another (2016 
YLR 1300). The relevant extract from the same is reproduced below: - 
 
“6. 
Learned lower appellate court has rightly held that 
respondent No.1 purchased the disputed shop from a co-
sharer/paternal aunt. Hence, he also became a co-sharer in the 
joint property. Furthermore, it is established law that a co- 
sharer cannot file a suit for declaration and possession against 
the other co-sharer but a suit for partition can only be filed. The 
Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case reported as Mst. 
Sanobar Sultan and others v. Obaidullah Khan and others (PLD 
2009 SC 71) has held as under:-- 
"A purchaser of a share out of a joint property 
having become a co- owner, his status as a tenant 
ceases and his possession will become that of a co-

6 
 
C.R.No.212-D of 2018 
 
 
owner who falls within the definition of a 
landlord. A co-sharer is entitled to retain the 
possession of the joint property till partition." 
12.  
In the wake of survey of law on the subject, I find that in the case 
of FAZAL and others v. GHULAM MUHAMMAD and others (2003 SCMR 
999), Bench comprising of three Hon’ble Judges of Supreme Court of 
Pakistan held that suit for permanent injunction is maintainable on behalf of 
co-sharer/co-owner. 
13.  
After having a wade through the principles laid down from time to 
time with regard to the proposition in hand, it evinces that the question 
framed hereinabove is not so frizzy or ticklish. Law is consistent to this effect 
that every co-sharer/co-owner is owner in each and every inch of the joint 
property until it is partitioned by metes and bounds. It is also an oft repeated 
principle of law that a co-sharer/co-owner cannot change the nature of the 
joint property or raise construction without consent of the other co-
sharers/co-owners. If a co-sharer is dispossessed from the joint property in 
his/her possession by any other co-sharer, the remedy lies for regaining 
his/her possession either in a suit under section 9 of the Specific Relief Act, 
1877 or by way of a suit for partition.  
14.  
The matter, however, would become different in a case when a co-
sharer intends to change the nature of the joint holding or threatens the 
other co-sharers to divest from their right in the joint property as co-owner. 
In such a case, such co-owner can institute a suit for injunction restraining 
the former from changing the nature of the joint land or raising any 
construction upon the same. In the said eventuality, it is for the former to 
first of all get the joint land partitioned. In the present case, the principles 
laid down in FAZAL and others v. GHULAM MUHAMMAD and others 
supra are clearly attracted and as such the trial Court as well as the 
appellate Court have erred in law while dismissing the suit being not 
maintainable and barred by law. 
15.  
For the foregoing reasons, this petition is allowed. As a result, 
impugned orders dated 19th February, 2018 and 26th February, 2018 are set 
aside being tainted with illegalities and material irregularities. As a 

7 
 
C.R.No.212-D of 2018 
 
 
consequence, the suit instituted by the petitioners shall be deemed to be 
pending before the learned Senior Civil Judge (Civil Division), Rawalpindi, 
who shall either decide the same by his own or entrust it to any other Court 
of competent jurisdiction. Needless to observe that the Court seized with the 
matter shall decide the suit afresh on its own merits, strictly in accordance 
with law. Parties are directed to appear before the learned Senior Civil 
Judge (Civil Division), Rawalpindi on 15.04.2023.
