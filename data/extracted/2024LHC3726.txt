J U D G M E N T 
 
Date of hearing:     02.09.2024 
Petitioner by: 
Sh. Istamadat Ali, Advocate.  
 
Respondents by:``` Mr. Imran Shaukat Rao, Assistant Advocate 
General on Court’s call.    
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.: Through 
instant petition, petitioner has called in question order dated 
25.05.2024 and judgment dated 13.07.2024, passed by learned 
Special Judge (Rent) and Additional District Judge, Talagang, 
respectively, whereby ejectment petition, filed by respondent No.1, 
was concurrently allowed.  
 
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that respondent No.1 filed petition 
for eviction of petitioner from shop in question by contending that 
tenancy period expired on 04.03.2023, after which new tenancy 
agreement was not executed between the parties, however petitioner 
neither vacated the rented premises nor paid the rent w.e.f. 
01.01.2024. Petitioner contested the ejectment petition by filing 
petition for leave to contest. After hearing arguments of the sides, 
learned Special Judge (Rent) dismissed the said application and 
accepted the ejectment petition, directing petitioner to deliver 
vacant possession of the demised premises within 60 days 
positively, vide order dated 25.05.2024. Feeling aggrieved, 
petitioner filed appeal before learned Additional District Judge,

Talagang, which met with the same fate vide judgment dated 
13.07.2024. Hence, instant petition. 
 
3. 
Learned counsel submits that petitioner spent an amount of 
Rs.23 lacs on completion of rented premises, which is Pagri in 
terms of Section 2(e) of the Punjab Rented Premises Act, 2009  
(“the Act of 2009”) and the Rent Tribunal was to decide the fate of 
Pagri amount while deciding the ejectment petition. He adds that 
tenancy agreement had to expire on 15.03.2024 and an amount of 
Rs.100,000/- from the advance amount was still in the possession of 
respondent No.1 / landlord, thus, the said amount was liable to be 
adjusted in the rent till 15.03.2024. He further submits that material 
aspects of the matter have been overlooked while passing the 
impugned decisions. 
 
4. 
Heard. Available record perused. 
 
5. 
Relationship of landlord and tenant and execution of rent 
agreement dated 14.02.2018 with its terms and conditions are 
undisputed and admitted between the parties. Execution of rent 
agreement dated 14.02.2018 with its terms and conditions is also 
admitted. Expiry of duration of tenancy period, as alleged in 
ejectment petition, was also acknowledged by petitioner in his 
application for leave to contest, however his main stance is that 
delay in vacation of rented premises and payment of arrears of rent 
was due to dispute over non-payment of Rs.23 lacs by respondent 
No.1, incurred by petitioner on renovation of the rented premises.  
 
6. 
Record shows that tenancy period commenced from 
05.03.2018 and lapsed after completion of five years on 
04.03.2023. Thereafter, no fresh tenancy agreement was executed 
between the parties regarding extension of tenancy period and 
petitioner has not tendered any documentary proof to negate this 
fact. Non-payment of rent after expiry of aforesaid period is also an 
established fact. In these circumstances grounds (a) & (b) 
mentioned in Section 15 of the Act of 2009 were available to 

 
Writ Petition No.2390 of 2024

landlord / respondent No.1 in order to seek eviction of tenant / 
petitioner.  
 
7. 
The prime contention of petitioner to defend the aforesaid 
defaults is the amount allegedly incurred by him on renovation as 
well as has emphasized on Clause 6 of the tenancy agreement dated 
14.02.2018, which reads as under:- 
 
 
6.
 ہی ہک 
 دواکن رباےئ اپررل یک وخوصبریت زتنیئ و آراشئ یک اخرط تھچ رپ سی لی گ اور رفش
 رپ اٹلیئ یسنیف اک اکم اپررل اک امکل وخد رکاےئ اگ ینعی رکاہی دار یک ذہم داری وہ یگ ۔ اس رپ اےنھٹ واےل
ارخااجت وصبرت ےب دیلخ امکل اجدیئاد نم رقم ادا رکےن اک اپدنب وہ اگ۔ 
 
 
8. 
The petitioner’s claim is that renovation expenses qualify as 
Pagri under Section 2(e) of the Punjab Rented Premises Act, 2009, 
which reads as under:- 
 
“pagri” includes any amount received by a landlord at the 
time of grant or renewal of a tenancy except advance rent 
or security.” 
 
 
From the above definition, the contention of petitioner is not 
legally sustainable. Pagri is traditionally defined as a payment 
made for the right to occupy a rented property and is distinct from 
costs incurred for property improvements. Such expenses do not 
fall within the statutory definition of Pagri and are not afforded 
protection under the Act. Claims related to renovation expenses are 
more appropriately pursued in a Civil Court, where matters of this 
nature can be properly adjudicated. 
 
9. 
Rent Tribunals are specifically established to regulate 
relationships between landlords and tenants, ensuring that disputes 
arising from tenancy agreements are resolved in a timely and cost-
effective manner. Their jurisdiction is not intended to serve as an 
alternative forum for claims that fall under the purview of Civil 
Courts, particularly those involving financial recoveries or damages 
unrelated to the tenancy itself. In the present case, the petitioner’s 
claim for the recovery of renovation costs incurred during the 
tenancy falls outside the scope of the Rent Tribunal's authority.

Such claims must be pursued in a Civil Court, where the 
appropriate legal framework exists to address issues of financial 
restitution and contractual obligations. The Rent Tribunal’s role is 
limited to matters directly concerning the tenancy, such as eviction 
or rent disputes, and does not extend to broader financial claims 
that require more comprehensive legal examination of detailed 
evidence. This jurisdiction is also not available qua claims of 
possession through partition or disputed title or ownership claim 
on the basis of sale agreement or claim of possession on the basis 
of some agreement or for that matter other claims that are 
required to be resolved by the Civil Courts. This view is also 
supported by the dictum laid down in Mst. BOR Bibi and others v. 
Abdul Qadir and others (1996 SCMR 877), Karam Rasool v. Town 
Committee, Zafarwal and others (2006 SCMR 1061), Mst. Seema 
Begum v. Muhammad Ishaq and others (PLD 2009 Supreme 
Court 45), Khawaja Waliullah and others v. Haji Amir Maqsood 
(1999 CLC 400) and Abdul Rehman v. Additional District Judge 
and 2 others (2024 MLD 413).  
 
10. 
Needless to say that claim of renovation costs is unlikely to 
protect the petitioner from the eviction order, which has been 
rightly passed by the learned Courts below after a correct 
appreciation of the applicable law and the facts of the case. There is 
no basis for this Court to interfere with the impugned decisions in 
the exercise of its constitutional jurisdiction. 
 
11. 
In view of the above, instant petition, being devoid of any 
merit, is hereby dismissed with no order as to costs.
