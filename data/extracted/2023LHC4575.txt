====== 
Through this petition under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, 
petitioner Shamim Akhtar has challenged the vires 
of order dated 17.03.2023 passed by the learned Ex-
Officio Justice of Peace, Faisalabad whereby upon 
her petition under Section 22-A Cr.P.C. seeking 
registration of criminal case against the proposed 
accused, the said Court referred the matter to the 
CPO, Faisalabad for addressing her grievance.  
2. 
Brief facts necessary for disposal of present 
writ petition are that the petitioner filed a petition 
under Section 22-A Cr.P.C. before the learned Ex-
Officio Justice of Peace alleging therein that on 
16.121.2022 at about 5.00 p.m. proposed accused 
Pervaiz @ Paija, ASI/ Incharge Police Post 
Shalimar, P.S Batala Colony, alongwith other police 
officials apprehended nephew of petitioner namely 
Kashif Masih, tortured him with his stick, resulting 
into fracture of right foot and left him near his house 
in a severe injured condition; She, in the first 
instance, filed application for registration of case 
before the concerned Station House Officer but no 
action was taken thereon which constrained her to 
file application before Ex-Officio Justice of Peace, 

W.P. No.37138/2023                                                                
                    | 2 
 
who after obtaining comments from the police, vide 
impugned order dated 17.03.2023 referred the 
matter to respondent No.2/CPO, Faisalabad to 
address the grievance of the petitioner and then 
proceed with the matter strictly in accordance with 
law. Being dissatisfied with the said order, the 
petitioner preferred instant writ petition.  
3. 
Heard. Learned counsel for the petitioner laid 
much emphasis that learned Ex-officio Justice of 
Peace vested with no authority to refer the matter to 
CPO, Faisalabad for addressing the grievance of the 
petitioner; that while dealing with the application 
U/S 22-A Cr.P.C. Ex Officio Justice of Peace is duty 
bound to pass a direction either for registration of 
case or its dismissal; that merely for the reasons that 
the proposed accused are police officials, they 
cannot be given premium of inquiry prior to 
registration of case. I am in agreement with the 
submission of learned counsel for the petitioner that 
there was no justification for the learned Ex Officio 
Justice of Peace for referring the matter to police 
authorities for addressing the grievance of the 
petitioner. The context in which the word ‘shall’ 
used in Section 154 Cr.P.C. leads me to an 
irresistible conclusion that the police has no 
authority/ discretion whatsoever to ascertain the 
veracity of information disclosing commission of 
cognizable offence prior to registration of case.  In 
case reported as Sana Ullah ..Vs.. SHO, Police 
Station Civil Lines, Gujrat and 3 others (PLD 2003 
Lahore 228), it has been held as under:- 
“… the words “every information relating to the 
commission of a cognizable offence” appearing in 
section 154, Cr.P.C., pertain only to the information 
so supplied and do not pertain to actual commission 

W.P. No.37138/2023                                                                
                    | 3 
 
of a cognizable offence. These provisions are 
universally accepted to mean that the information 
supplied should be about an alleged commission of a 
cognizable offence irrespective of the fact whether 
such information is ultimately proved to be correct or 
not and also irrespective of the fact whether 
ultimately such an offence is found to have been 
actually committed or not. All that a Station House 
Officer is to be satisfied with at such a stage is that 
the information is in respect of an offence which is 
cognizable. The argument of the learned counsel for 
the petitioner that a Station House Officer is to form 
an opinion at such a stage  whether any cognizable 
offence has actually been committed or not does not 
fit into the scheme of Code of Criminal Procedure as 
is 
evident 
from 
the 
provisions 
of 
sections 
154,155,157,167,169 
and 
170, 
Cr.P.C., 
which 
highlight a clear distinction between an “information” 
and an “investigation” during which the information 
received earlier on may or may not be found to be 
correct.” 
Similarly, in case reported as Muhammad 
Bashir ..Vs.. Station House Officer, Okara Cantt. 
and others, (PLD 2007 Supreme Court 53), the 
Hon’ble Apex Court has laid down as under:- 
“ It may be reiterated and even emphasized 
that there was no provision in law, including the said 
section 154 or 155 of the Cr.P.C. which authorized an 
Officer Incharge of a Police Station to hold any 
enquiry to assess the correctness or the falsity of the 
information received by him before complying with 
the command of the said provisions which obliged 
him to reduce he same into writing irrespective of the 
fact whether such an information was true or 
otherwise.” 
4. 
The direction of the learned Ex-officio Justice 
of Peace for referring the matter to CPO, Faisalabad 
without dismissing or allowing the application of the 
petitioner for registration of case being contrary to 

W.P. No.37138/2023                                                                
                    | 4 
 
law cannot be allowed to hold field. Bare reading of 
the application of the petitioner seeking registration 
of criminal case against the proposed accused, 
coupled with medico legal certificate of the injured 
discloses commission of cognizable offence. Thus, 
irrespective of the veracity or otherwise of the 
allegations contained in the said application, it was 
the bounden duty of the Station House Officer 
concerned to register the FIR and then proceed with 
the investigation strictly in accordance with law but 
he has failed to perform his statutory duty enshrined 
under the law, which constrained the petitioner to 
knock the door of Ex-officio Justice of Peace, who 
also unfortunately failed to exercise the authority 
vested him under the law and passed a direction 
which is contrary to law.  
5. 
For what has been discussed above, instant 
writ petition is allowed as a result whereof 
impugned order of learned Ex-officio Justice of 
Peace dated 17.03.2023 is set-aside.  Respondent 
No.4/ S.H.O. shall record the statement of the 
petitioner U/S 154 Cr.P.C. and then proceed further 
with the matter strictly in accordance with law.
