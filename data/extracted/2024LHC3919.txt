AHMAD NADEEM ARSHAD, J.   This Civil Revision is 
directed against the judgment and decree dated 14.04.2011 of learned 
appellate court, whereby while allowing the appeal of the respondents 
suit for possession through pre-emption instituted by them was 
decreed.   
2. 
 
Relevant facts forming background of this petition are 
that the plaintiffs (hereinafter referred to as “the respondents”) 
instituted a suit for possession through pre-emption on 12.09.2005 
against the defendants (hereinafter referred to as “the petitioners”) by 
pre-empting the land measuring 21-Kanals 05-Marlas (hereinafter 
referred to as “suit property”) sold out by one Muhammad Ashraf 
through oral sale mutation No.27 dated 08.08.2005 for consideration 

C.R.No.1415 of 2011. 
2
of Rs.3,50,000/-, by claiming their superior rights of pre-emption 
being shafi sharik, shafi khalit and shafi jaar with the contention that 
the vendor (Muhammad Ashraf) sold the suit property through oral 
sale mutation in a secret manner without giving notice u/s 31 of the 
Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1991 (hereinafter referred to as “the Act”) 
for a consideration of Rs.110,000/- but due to fear of pre-emption 
incorporated expository amount of Rs.350,000/-; that they came to 
know about the sale of the suit property on 13.08.2005 at 6:00 PM 
through Mulazim Hussain s/o Anayat Shah when they were sitting in 
the house of Muzaffar Shah s/ Fida Hussain along with Noor Din s/o 
Imam Din and Abid Hussain s/o Peer Khadim and they immediately 
announced their intention with regard to exercise of their right of pre-
emption and in this way performed Talb-i-Muwathibat; that they 
asked the petitioners to alienate the suit property in their name after 
receipt of actual consideration amount of Rs.1,10,000/- by sending 
notices 
of 
Talb-i-Ishhad 
through 
registered 
post 
with 
acknowledgement due dated 15.08.2005 but they refused to do so, 
which constrained them to institute the suit by exercising their right of 
Khusumat and prayed for decree of their suit. The petitioners resisted 
the suit through filing contested written statement wherein they raised 
certain preliminary objections, denied the averments made in the 
plaint and maintained that the respondents neither fulfilled the 
requirement of Talbs nor sent notice of Talb-i-Ishhad and prayed for 
dismissal of the suit. The learned trial court keeping in view the 
divergent pleadings of the parties framed necessary issues and invited 
the parties to produce evidence in support of their versions. After 

C.R.No.1415 of 2011. 
3
recording evidence of the parties pro and contra, oral as well as 
documentary, the learned trial court vide judgment and decree dated 
24.11.2010 dismissed the suit. Feeling aggrieved, the respondents 
preferred an appeal which was allowed by the learned appellate court 
vide impugned judgment and decree dated 14.04.2011 and resultantly 
decreed the suit. Being dis-satisfied, the petitioners approached this 
Court through the instant civil revision.  
3. 
 
No one is present on behalf of the respondents, as they 
have already been proceeded against ex-parte vide order dated 
08.02.2021.  
4. 
 
I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioners at full 
length and perused the record with his able assistance.  
5. 
 
It is evident from the record that the respondents got 
examined six witnesses as PW-1 to PW-6 and produced 20 documents 
as Exh.P-1 to Exh.P-20. Whereas, in rebuttal the petitioners got 
examined one of the defendants, namely, Muhammad  Anayat  as 
DW-1 and Ghulam Qadir as DW-2, however, they did not produce 
any documentary evidence.  
                 From scanning of said oral as well as documentary 
evidence it appears that the respondents got examined one of the 
plaintiffs namely Chan Peer as PW-1, who deposed that suit property 
measuring 21-kanal 05-marla was sold out by one Muhammad Ashraf 
to the petitioners for a consideration of Rs.110,000/- but in order to 
avoid pre-emption they incorporated Rs.350,000/- as consideration 
amount. He further deposed that on 13.08.2005 at about 6:00 PM 
evening when they, Muzaffar, Ghulam Rasool, Peer Chan, Peer 

C.R.No.1415 of 2011. 
4
Ishfaq, Asif, Wasif, Noor Din and Abid were sitting in the house of 
Muzaffar Hussain, then Mulazim Hussain came there and informed 
that Ahmad Yar etc. purchased the suit property, then they said they 
will pre-empt it. He stated that they went to the office of Ghulam 
Rasool Advocate after getting copy of mutation and got prepared six 
notices of Talb-i-Ishhad bearing his thumb impression. He further 
deposed that said notices were in the names of Muhammad Anayat, 
Muhammad Walayat, Mehdi Khan, Muhammad Iqbal, Ahmad Yar 
and Mushtaq Ahmad and produced copies of said notices as Exh.P-1 
to Exh.P-6.  He further deposed that said notices were written by clerk 
of counsel and same were read over by the counsel to them. 
Thereafter they got registered said notices through post office in the 
name of the defendants. The post office delivered them the receipts of 
said registries, which they gave to their counsel. He further 
maintained that they are Khata Shareek. Thereafter they came to the 
house of defendants and asked them to receive actual paid amount and 
transfer the land but they refused.  
 
 
The respondents got examined Abid Hussain as PW-2 
and Noor Din as PW-3. The said witnesses are participants of the 
meeting where allegedly Talb-i-Muwathibat was performed and are 
attesting witnesses of notice of Talb-i-Ishhad. The said witnesses also 
deposed in the same line as PW-1 deposed in his statement. The 
respondents produced Muhammad Saleem Siddiqui Postmaster as 
PW-4, who maintained that receipts No.78 to No.83 were issued by 
him on 15.08.2005. He further stated that said receipts were handed 
over to the plaintiffs and registered envelopes with acknowledgement 

C.R.No.1415 of 2011. 
5
due were sent to the addresses of the defendants. The respondents 
produced Muhammad Mazhar Iqbal clerk counsel of Ch. Ghulam 
Rasool Gondal as PW-5, who deposed that notices of Talb-i-Ishhad 
Exh.P-1 to Exh.P-6 are in his handwriting and he put his signature on 
the said notices as scriber and identified his signature. The 
respondents also produced Muhammad Azam postman as PW-6. The 
respondents’ counsel produced copy of mutation No.27 dated 
08.08.2005 as Exh.P-13, copy of record of rights for the years 2000-
01 as Exh.P-14, three acknowledgement due as Exh.P-15 to Exh.P-17 
and three registered envelopes with acknowledgement due as Exh.P-
18 to Exh.P-20.  
 
 
One of the petitioners namely Muhammad Anayat 
appeared as DW-1, who maintained that he purchased the suit 
property for a consideration of Rs.350,000/- from Muhammad Ashraf 
vendor. He further maintained that suit property is adjacent to their 
property. He further stated that thoroughfare which goes to suit 
property also leads to their property.  Further states the watercourse 
also goes to the suit property from their property. He produced 
Ghulam Qadir in support of his version, who also deposed in the same 
lines as narrated by DW-1.  
 
 
There are certain contradictions in the statements of PWs. 
PW-1 maintained that notices were written by clerk counsel and the 
counsel read over the same to them, but, PW-2 maintained that notices 
were scribed by the counsel which was written by Muhammad Akram 
Mangat Advocate. He did not state that said notices were read over to 

C.R.No.1415 of 2011. 
6
them. PW-3 maintained that notices were written in his presence 
which were written by Muhammad Akram Advocate and clerk jointly.  
 
 
PW-1 stated that they were sitting in the house of 
Muzaffar Hussain where at 6:00 PM Mulazim Hussain came there, at 
that time except plaintiffs and Mulazim Hussain no other person was 
present there. PW-2 during cross-examination maintained that at that 
time four ladies and nine males were present. Whereas PW-3 
maintained that one or two ladies were present there. He also deposed 
that Peer Chan, Asif, Wasif, Pappu, Qasim, Abid, Zafar, Ghulam 
Rasool and one other person were present there, except them no other 
person was present there.  
 
 
PW-1 stated that they came from the house at 8:00 AM 
morning and came to Katchehry from house through wagon. PW-2 
maintained that they came to their counsel at 9:00 AM. He further 
deposed that they came through Rickshaw. Whereas PW-3 maintained 
that they reached at the office of their counsel at 11:00 A.M and they 
came to the office of their counsel on motorcycle and a Rickshaw.  
 
 
PW-1 maintained that he paid Rs.30/- for sending notices 
through registered post. He also maintained that he purchased 
registered envelopes from the Post Office of Mandi. He also 
maintained that he alone came to the Post Office. PW-2 maintained 
that they all went to the post office at about 2:30 PM where they 
purchased six registered envelopes. He did not remember that how 
much money was paid. PW-3 maintained that 10 persons went to the 
Post Office. PW-4 Postmaster during cross-examination maintained 
that six persons came to him and he handed over separate receipts to 

C.R.No.1415 of 2011. 
7
them. He further maintained that for each of them he charged Rs.20/- 
separately.  
              PW-5 scriber of the notices maintained that two plaintiffs 
were minors and their ages were near about 12 and 13 years. He 
further maintained that the plaintiffs came there at 10:00/11:00 AM 
and remained with them for about three hours. He also maintained that 
minors did not put their thumb impressions. He further deposed that 
the minors’ thumb impressions were got through plaintiff No.1 Chan 
Peer.  
             PW-6 Postman maintained that he went to the defendants 
where Muhammad Anayat, Muhammad Walayat, Mehdi Khan 
received notices of Talb-i-Ishhad, whereas Ahmad Yar, Mushtaq 
Ahmad and Muhammad Iqbal were not present there,  therefore said 
envelop was returned un-served. During cross-examination he 
maintained that he did not check I.D. cards of the persons who 
received registered envelopes.  
 
 
PW-1 while recording his statement deposed that after 
sending notices of Talb-i-Ishhad they came to the house of defendants 
and asked them to return the land after receipt of original paid amount 
but they refused. The respondents did not mention in their plaint that 
they went to the house of defendants and asked them to return the suit 
property. The other PWs also did not state this fact in their statements.  
 
      The respondents pleaded in their plaint that the suit property 
was actually sold out for a consideration of Rs.1,10,000/- but the 
petitioners got sanctioned the oral sale mutation No.27 dated 
08.08.2005 against an ostensible, fake and escalated consideration of 

C.R.No.1415 of 2011. 
8
Rs.3,50,000/- in clandestine manner to prevent the right of pre-
emption. The witnesses produced by the respondents also stated the 
same consideration amount. The respondents did not produce any 
documentary evidence which supported their stance that at the 
relevant time market value of the suit property was Rs.1,10,000/-. 
Neither any sale mutation or registered sale deed was produced nor 
any Government Notification was brought on record, which suggest 
that the value of suit property at that time was Rs.1,10,000/-. The 
learned trial court with regard to the said controversy framed issue 
No.3 and decided the said issue by holding that the defendants did not 
press this issue. The petitioners before the learned appellate court 
categorically denied of this fact that they did not press this issue 
before the learned trial court. Therefore, learned appellate court 
discussed the evidence of the parties and maintained that Rs.350,000/- 
was the actual price and decided this issue in affirmative in favour of 
the petitioners. The respondents did not assail said findings. Hence, it 
is established that the respondents intentionally mentioned a lower 
price of the suit property in order to obtain an un-due advantage and 
when an undue advantage is sought to be gained on the basis of a 
completely unsubstantiated statement, the same was not permissible 
as it could contravene the provisions of Shari’ah which have been 
made specifically applicable to pre-emption cases and it would 
disentitle a Shafee to claim pre-emption. Reliance in this regard is 
placed upon “SUBHANUDDIN and others versus PIR GHULAM” (PLD 
2015 Supreme Court 69). They had intentionally mentioned the 
wrong consideration amount in the plaint, notices of Talb-i-Ishhad as 

C.R.No.1415 of 2011. 
9
well as in their statements got recorded before the Court, therefore, 
they are not truthful witnesses.   
6. 
 
Perusal of the record it appears that seven plaintiffs 
including one of the minor plaintiff namely Wasif who was impleaded 
through his brother Peer Ishfaq instituted the suit for possession 
through pre-emption. However plaint is silent with regard to the fact 
that said Peer Ishfaq was ever appointed guardian by the court or not. 
Similarly it was not mentioned in the plaint that who made Talb-i-
Muwathibat on behalf of the minor Wasif (plaintiff) and similarly 
notices of Tabl-i-Ishhad are also silent, who being his guardian sent 
the notices on his behalf.   
7. 
 
The law permitted the guardian and agent to make 
demands on behalf of the person who is unable to make demands 
under Section 13 of the Act. In this regard Section 14 of the Act is 
relevant which is reproduced as under:- 
“14. Demand by guardian or agent:- Where a person is unable to 
make demands under section 13, his guardian or agent may make 
the required demands on his behalf.” 
 
 
No doubt the suit can be filed through next friend but the 
question is whether next friend can make demands in the special 
background of pre-emption right. The competency to act as next 
friend shall have to be assessed in the light of Injunctions of Islam, 
because of the conditions imposed by Section 3 of the Act which is 
reproduced below for ready reference:- 
“3. Interpretation. In the interpretation and the application of the 
provisions of this Act, the Court shall seek guidance from the Holy 
Qur’an and Sunnah.” 
 

C.R.No.1415 of 2011. 
10
 
The language of Section 3 is unequivocal on the point that all 
provisions of the Act shall be interpreted and for that matter all the 
words used in the Act shall be assigned meaning and applied, seeking 
guidance from the Holy Quran, Sunnah and Fiqah. Therefore, Section 
14 of the Act shall apply keeping it within the parameters of Islamic 
Law.  
 
The capacity of guardian has been discussed in Chapter XVIII 
Section 359 of the “Principals of Mohammdan Law” by D.F. Mulla 
wherein guardian of the property of minor defined as under:- 
“359. Legal guardian of property.--- The following persons are 
entitled in the order mentioned below to be guardians of the 
property of a minor:- 
(1) 
the father;  
(2) 
the executor appointed by the father’s will;  
(3) 
the father’s father; 
(4) 
the executor appointed by the will of the father’s father.” 
 
The word “guardian” has been defined in Black’s Law 
Dictionary (Eleventh Edition) in the following words: 
 
“Someone who has the legal authority and duty to care for another’s 
person or property, esp. because of the other’s infancy, incapacity, 
or disability.” 
 
 
The definition of “guardian ad litem” in Black’s Law 
Dictionary (Eleventh Edition) is as follows:- 
“A guardian, usu. A lawyer, appointed by the court to appear in a 
lawsuit on behalf of an incompetent or minor party.---” 
 
 
Right of pre-emption is a property based right. So the legal 
guardian of the property of the minor can be the only person who can 
decide the exercise of this right and not the “next friend” as identified 
in Order XXXII of C.P.C.  

C.R.No.1415 of 2011. 
11
 
This being the legal position it was the father of minor pre-
emptor who being legal guardian was obliged by law to perform all 
the Talbs under section 13 of the Act. The suit is also to be instituted 
by the person who makes any demand. As discussed earlier, plaint as 
well as notice of Talb-i-Ishhad is silent with regard to performance of 
Talb-i-Muwathibat and Talb-i-Ishhad on behalf of the minor. 
Similarly no evidence was produced in this regard. Peer Ishfq has no 
authority to perform Talb-i-Muwathibat, Talb-i-Ishhad and Talb-i-
Khusumat on behalf of his minor brother Wasif (one of the plaintiffs). 
It means that neither any Talbs were performed on behalf of the minor 
nor suit was instituted on his behalf. A demand made by father or a 
brother of the pre-emptor is not sufficient, even if he has a right to 
pre-empt, unless he has been previously authorized to make the 
demand.  
8. 
 
It is evident from the record that out of seven plaintiffs, 
only one plaintiff namely Chan Peer appeared in the witness box as 
PW-1.  
 
The plaintiffs in their plaint averred that they made Talb-i-
Muwathibat and Talb-i-Ishhad, however, admittedly only Chan Peer 
(plaintiff) opted to face the music of cross-examination, whereas the 
rest of the respondents/plaintiffs did not opt to appear. Although there 
is no specific provision either in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 or 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 requiring such personal appearance of 
all the plaintiffs but at the same time, it is the settled law that where a 
“fact” is required to be proved through oral evidence, such evidence 
must be direct and of the primary source. Article 71 of the Qanun-e-

C.R.No.1415 of 2011. 
12
Shahadat Order, 1984 provides the instances of the direct oral 
evidence regarding the proof of a fact. The foundation of such direct 
evidence about the proof of the “fact” of Talb-i-Muwathibat, is the 
“person”, who has made the Talb. It is he, who should appear 
enabling himself for the cross-examination of the other side.  
 
The Article 129(g) of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 enables 
the court to draw adverse inference in the eventuality of withholding 
the best evidence. The non-appearance of a party as his own witness, 
ordinarily discredit his case. Where the fact is in the personal 
knowledge of a person himself and he is the primary source to prove 
the “fact”, if such person, without any sufficient cause, abstains from 
appearance in the court, the requisite inference shall be drawn.  
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan while dealing with said 
proposition in a case “ABDUL QAYYUM versus MUHAMMAD SADIQ” 
(2007 SCMR 957) held as under:- 
“The pre-emptor, no doubt could appoint an attorney to pursue the 
suit but Talb-i-Muwathibat being a personal act of the pre-emptor, 
is required to be proved by him through his own statement and an 
attorney may not be a substitute of the pre-emptor under the law, 
therefore, notwithstanding the provision of section 14 of Punjab Pre-
emption Act, 1991 according to which if a person is unable to make 
demand under section 13 (ibid), his agent may make such demand 
on his behalf but the petitioner cannot get benefit of this exception 
firstly for the reason that he has claimed performance of Talb-i-
Muwathibat in person and secondly, this exception appears to have 
been created to meet a situation in which either the pre-emptor is 
minor or is invalid or is not in a position in the ordinary 
circumstances to make Talb-i-Muwathibat himself and appear in 
Court in person. In the case in hand,  it is an admitted fact that the 
pre-emptor himself made Talb-i-Muwathibat and was also available 
both at his ordinary place of residence and business and was not 
suffering from any disability to appear before the Court. It is also a 
fact that the attorney of pre-emptor had no direct knowledge of the 
performance of Talb-i-Muwathibat by the pre-emptor, therefore, his 
statement regarding performance of Talb-i-Ishhad was based on 
hearsay knowledge.” 
 

C.R.No.1415 of 2011. 
13
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in another case 
“DILSHAD BEGUM versus Mst. NISAR AKHTAR” (PLJ 2012 SC 912) 
held as under:- 
“8. There is yet another aspect. The best evidence with regard to 
performance of Talb-e-Muwathibat is the person who makes such a 
talb. The effect of non-production of best evidence is provided in 
Section 129 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, which reads as 
follows:- 
“129. Court may presume existence of certain, facts.—Court 
may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to 
have happened, regard being had to the common course of 
natural events, human conduct and public and private 
business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case.  
Illustrations 
The Court may presume— 
(a) that man who is in possession of stolen goods soon after the 
theft is either the if or has received the goods knowing them 
to be stolen, unless he can account for his possession;  
(b) that an accomplice is unworthy of credit, unless he is 
corroborated in material particulars;  
(c) that a bill of exchange, accepted or endorsed, was accepted 
or endorsed for good consideration;  
(d) that a thing or state of things which has been shown for be in 
existence within a period shorter than that which such things 
or states of things usually cease to exist, is still to existence;  
(e) the judicial and official acts have, been regularity performed;  
(f) that the common course of business has been followed in 
particular cases;  
(g) that evidence which could be and is not produced would, if 
produced, be unfavourable to the person who withholds it. 
(Emphasis is supplied);  
(h) that, if a man refuses to answer a question which he is not 
compelled to answer by law, the answer, if given, would be 
unfavourable to him;  
(i) that when a document creating an obligation is in the hands 
of the obliger, the obligation has been discharged.” 
9. The case of the respondent/plaintiff would be squarely hit by 
Article 129(g) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order referred to above as 
without assigning any reason, the best evidence was withheld and 
not produced.” 
 
9. 
 
The respondents claimed in their plaint and evidence that 
they came to know about the sale through Mulazim Hussain s/o 
Anayat Shah (informer) but they failed to produce the said alleged 
informer from whom they got information about the sale transaction. 
Production of informer in pre-emption cases was imperative for the 

C.R.No.1415 of 2011. 
14
pre-emptor to prove the fulfillment of first demand of Talb-i-
Muwathibat whose deposition being as a star witness was considered 
to be relevant having direct bearing qua the proof of said fact. He is 
the person who sets off the events leading to the institution of a suit 
for pre-emption. If he is not examined or he refused to enter in the 
witness box, the inescapable conclusion would be that he was not 
willing and ready to support the assertions made by the plaintiff.  
 
The fate/effect of non-production of informer in a pre-emption 
case cropped up before the Honorable Supreme Court in case titled 
“MUHAMMAD MAL KHAN versus ALLAH YAR KHAN” (2002 SCMR 
235), wherein it was held as under:- 
“It was also not clarified/explained by the plaintiff in his statement 
as to why Tayyab Khan could not be produced as it was not stated 
that he was either won over by the other side or that he had turned 
hostile towards him for some other reasons or that out of fear of the 
defendant or for some other consideration the defendant was 
successful to prevent him to depose in favour of the plaintiff. Article 
129(g) of Qanun-e-Shahadat reads:- 
“That evidence which could be and is not produced would, if 
produced, be unfavourable to the person who withholds it.” 
Therefore, in absence of any explanation by the plaintiff as to why he 
withheld Tayyab Khan from examining him as his witness the legal 
presumption would be that in case he had been produced then his 
deposition must have been against him.” 
 
 
The evidence of an informer in a suit for pre-emption is of 
particular significance. It is evident from the observation of the 
Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan made in the case of “ABDUL 
REHMAN versus Haji GHAZAN KHAN” (2007 SCMR 1491), the 
relevant portion wherefrom is reproduced for the ease of reference 
hereunder:- 
“A pre-emptor claiming right of pre-emption, as a matter of 
prudence, ought to seek corroboration to satisfy reasonably the 
judicial mind of the Court that Talb-i-Mowasibat was made by him 
enabling him to make the other demand (Talb-i-Ishhad). In this case, 

C.R.No.1415 of 2011. 
15
failure to put the informer in witness-box, seen from that angle as 
well, raise a logical presumption that appellant feared that the 
witness, if examined, could not stand the test of cross-examination or 
that the witness would not support him or that his evidence would be 
against him.” 
 
 
In SUBHANUDDIN’s case referred supra the Honorable 
Supreme Court has held that non-production of informer in a pre-
emption suit is a sufficient ground for dismissal of the pre-emptor’s 
suit. For sake of convenience, the relevant part of the judgment is 
reproduced below:- 
“It was, the respondent’s case that upon his return from Punjab he 
was informed about the sale by his brother (Taj Ali). Taj Ali, lives in 
the same house as the respondent, but did not know whether the 
respondent was in the village when the sale took place, nor when the 
respondent returned from the Punjab and that he was informed 
about the sale by his nephew Nazir. The initial burden of proof with 
regard to these facts (the conveying of the information of sale and 
price) lay upon the respondent, and to establish the same Nazir 
could have been called to give evidence, as the evidence in this 
regard (which was oral), was required to be direct and of the 
witness who saw, heard or perceived it himself (Article 71 of the 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984), but Nazir was not produced as a 
witness. Consequently, an important and relevant fact was not 
proved by the respondent and on this ground alone the suit merited 
dismissal as Talb-i-Muwathibat is required to be made immediately 
upon learning of the sale.” 
 
10. 
 
The fact of a sale of land is a fact that can be seen, such 
as, by observing or taking part in the sale-transaction or by seeing the 
sale deed or sale mutation. The person who conveys the information 
of the fact of sale must be a person who has seen the fact of sale and it 
is he who can then pass on the said fact to another person(s). Thus, the 
chain of the source of information, as to the fact of sale, from the very 
first person, who has the direct knowledge thereof and passes on the 
same to the person who lastly informs the pre-emptor, must be 
complete. Only the complete chain of the source of information of the 
sale can establish the essential elements of Talb-i-Muwathibat, which 

C.R.No.1415 of 2011. 
16
are: (i) the time, date and place when the pre-emptor obtained the first 
information of the sale, and; (ii) the immediate declaration of his 
intention by the pre-emptor to exercise his right of pre-emption, then 
and there, on obtaining such information. In the present case, such 
chain of the source of passing on the information, as to the fact of sale 
of the suit land has not been proved, and the entire case as to making 
of Talb-i-Muwathibat. The respondents failed to produce their star 
witness namely Mulazim Hussain who informed the sale of land to 
them and if the said witness was produced in evidence, then certainly 
he was cross-examined as to whether he has any direct knowledge 
with regard to the fact of sale or he heard it from anyone else and his 
information based upon hearsay evidence. For ready reference 
reliance is placed upon “FARID ULLAH KHAN versus IRFAN ULLAH 
KHAN” (2022 SCMR 1231) and “MUHAMMAD RIAZ versus MUHAMMAD 
AKRAM and others” (2024 SCMR 692).  
11. 
 
From the scanning of evidence available on the record it 
is established that the respondents failed to prove the performance of 
requisite Talbs as prescribed under the law. The learned appellate 
court failed to appreciate the actual facts as well as evidence on record 
in its true perspective, hence committed grave illegality and material 
irregularity while passing the impugned judgment and decree, which 
is not sustained in the eye of law.  
12. 
 
Epitome of above discussion is that this civil revision is 
allowed. The impugned judgment and decree of learned appellate 
court dated 14.04.2011 is hereby set aside. Consequently, the suit for 

C.R.No.1415 of 2011.

possession through pre-emption instituted by the respondents shall 
stand dismissed. No order as to costs.
