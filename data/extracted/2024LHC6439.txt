Muhammad 
Ahsan, 
petitioner/accused seeks quashing of FIR No.3232, dated 
07.12.2023 registered under section 295A PPC at police station 
Aroop, District Gujranwala.  
 
2.       Briefly stated allegation as per impugned FIR are that 
Chaudhary Sagheer Abbas Virk, respondent No.4/complainant 
submitted an application to the concerned police for registration 
of FIR with the allegation that on 26.11.2023 at 03:00 p.m. 
petitioner/accused issued “Fatwa” wherein he declared 
followers of Shia sect as non-Muslim with some more 
declarations uncalled for and thereby insulted their religious 
belief which have wounded the religious feelings of such 
community 
 
 
3. 
   Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that offence 
under Section 295A PPC is non-cognizable, and allegations 
cannot be used for prosecution until Provincial government 
files a complaint through a special procedure provided under 
section 196 Cr.P.C; therefore, registration of FIR on the 
application of private individual which offends the legal 
process is a nullity, liable to be quashed. In this respect he has

placed reliance on different reported judgments; some of which 
are referred as under;

      On the other hand, learned counsel for the 
complainant while relying on cases reported as “SHAFIQ 
AHMAD versus THE STATE” (PLD 1959 (W.P.) Lahore 851); 
“AZIM KHAN AND ANOTHER versus THE STATE” (1970 Cr. L 
J 77); “MUHAMMAD ASLAM versus THE STATE AND 
ANOTHER” (1980 P Cr. L J 742); “MUHAMMAD versus THE 
STATE” (1989 P Cr. L J 834); and “SHABBIR HUSSAIN versus 
THE STATE” (2011 P Cr. L J 1631), states that if any 
irregularity has been committed by the police, complainant 
cannot be held responsible; therefore, it can be rectified through 
further process. He further submits that penal provision 
mentioned in FIR does not decide its fate, rather contents be 
given preference which do disclose commission of an offence 
under section 8/9 of Anti-terrorism Act, 1997, for addition of 
which he had already filed an application before SP 
investigation concerned.

5. 
   On the divergent contentions of both the parties it was 
desirable for the Court to look into the question of law with 
deep insight. By virtue of interim order, dated 15.11.2024 
passed by this Court in connected Crl. Misc. No. 40979-B of 
2024, it was observed that though as per criminal procedure, an 
investigation starts only after registration of FIR or with the 
permission of Magistrate yet a regime of preliminary 
investigation has been introduced in Section 196B Cr.P.C., for 
offences mentioned in section 196 of Cr.P.C., which includes 
section 295A PPC, probably for collection of material in order 
to obtain sanction for prosecution from Federal or provincial 
government; therefore, if the FIR stands registered as has been 
done in this case, would it be a nullity, or mere an irregularity 
which can be cured through process of law. Thus, Prosecutor-
General Punjab was directed to assist the Court on this question 
of law whereas Ms. Nuzhat Bashir, Deputy Prosecutor-General 
and M/s. Burhan Moazzam Malik and Mian Tabassum Ali, 
Advocates were appointed as amici curiae for legal opinion in 
this case.  
 
6. 
Learned Prosecutor-General Punjab entered appearance 
and stated that offence is non-cognizable, therefore, registration 
of FIR in this case is nullity and liable to be quashed; whereas 
Mr. Burhan Moazzam Malik, learned amicus curiae while 
agreeing with opinion of learned Prosecutor-General stated that 
section 196B added in Cr.P.C., in year 1923 empowers officer 
in charge of investigation in the district to direct an inspector to 
conduct preliminary investigation for offences listed in section 
196 Cr.P.C., but such section stands in contrast to dicta laid 
down by Supreme Court of Pakistan in case reported as 
“SHAHNAZ BEGUM versus THE HON’BLE JUDGES OF THE 
HIGH COURT OF SIND AND BALUCHISTAN AND ANOTHER” 
(PLD 1971 Supreme Court 677), which says that there is no 
concept of preliminary investigation in law nor it has been 
defined in Cr.P.C., therefore, it cannot take the status of a full-
fledged investigation; however, stated that in this case even 
preliminary investigation was not conducted, therefore, 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                4 
 
investigation in this case after registration of FIR under section 
295A PPC (non-cognizable offence) cannot be given 
protection. Ms. Nuzhat Bashir, Deputy Prosecutor-General, 
learned 
amicus 
curiae 
while 
submitting 
her 
written 
submissions, opened the arguments that though FIR is nullity 
but for entering into investigation FIR is not a condition 
precedent, therefore, investigation so far conducted can be 
given protection under the shield of section 537 of Cr.P.C. She 
has placed her reliance in this respect on cases reported as 
“MUHAMMAD BASHIR Versus STATION HOUSE OFFICER, 
OKARA CANTT. and others” (PLD 2007 Supreme Court 539), 
“ALTAF HUSSAIN versus ABDUL SAMAD and 3 others” (2000 
SCMR 1945) and a case from Indian jurisdiction reported as 
“Lalita Kumari vs Govt. of U.P. & Ors” (AIR 2014 Supreme 
Court 187). She was of the view that investigation so far 
conducted shall be deemed regularized under section 196B 
Cr.P.C., or can be legalized by involving the institution of 
Magistrate as ordained under section 155 of Cr.P.C. On 
divergent contentions, this Court by virtue of order, dated 
27.11.2024, passed in connected Crl. Misc. No. 40979-B of 
2024 observed as under: 
“The divergent stances question the legal process for 
registration of FIR. The word ‘FIR’ (First information Report) 
is not the creation of section 154 or 155 of Cr.P.C. rather used 
for the first time in Chapter XXIV of Police Rules 1934. First 
information with respect to commission of an offence is 
sometimes received by the police from a passersby, medical 
attendant or person from the locality but on their information, 
FIR is not registered in our system; therefore, without looking 
at Police Rules, scheme of registration of case under Cr.P.C., is 
apparently straight. Every information received by Station 
House Officer shall be entered in a book to be kept by such 
officer in such form as the Provincial Government may 
prescribe in this behalf and both sections 154 & 155 probably 
talk about one book as ordained under Section 44 of Police Act 
1861 and Article 167 of Police Order 2002, and then 
investigation in cognizable offence is started by the police 
officer at his own and in non-cognizable offence with the 
permission of Magistrate. In both type of offences when the 
formal process is initiated police enter into realm of section 157 
Cr.P.C., and either decline to investigate or continue on 
investigation, ensued by a report either under section 157 or 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                5 
 
section 173 of Cr.P.C. to be submitted before the Magistrate, 
who is authorized to order for an inquiry or investigation under 
section 159 Cr.P.C. or after taking cognizance on report under 
section 173 Cr.P.C. either commences the trial or send it for 
trial to Court of Session, or can cancel the case under section 
173(3) of Cr.P.C.  
 
      Cognizable & non-cognizable offences are known as 
arrestable & non-arrestable offence in our system as per section 
4(f) & 4(n) of Cr.P.C. Apparently entering the information in a 
register of FIR is not necessary for investigation or trial but in 
our system much energy is consumed  to get the information 
entered in register of FIR for which an institution of ex-officio 
Justice of the Peace was also established whose orders for and 
against are further challenged before the High Courts and 
Supreme Court and in this way status of information is 
converted into legally drafted complaint which is not the spirit 
of section 154 or 155 of Cr.P.C. because case is to be 
developed through recording of statements under section 161 of 
Cr.P.C. and other processes. It has further been experienced 
that later for cancellation of such FIR, institution of Magistrate 
is also entangled whose orders for and against are further 
assailed before the higher forums. Such regime takes a 
considerable span of time even to initiate the first criminal 
process which in other jurisdictions is just a phone call away.” 
 
Thus, to resolve the controversy, following questions were 
framed for amici curiae: - 
1. For registration of cases, Section 154 & 155 of Cr.P.C. mandate 
that information of offence shall be entered in a book to be kept 
as prescribed by the Provincial Government; had it ever been 
prescribed.? 
 
2. Whether there are different books for cognizable & non-
cognizable cases.? 
 
3. If prescribed book is the ‘register of FIR’ for cognizable offence 
and daily diary/station diary for non-cognizable offence, then 
both being creation of Police Rules can surpass the provisions 
of Cr.P.C.? 
 
4. When there are no direct provisions to regulate the process in 
Cr.P.C., can it be controlled by indirect subordinate legislation 
in the form of Police Rules 1934 made under Police Act 1861 
(Now Police Order 2002).? 
 
5. Aren’t Police Rules for superintendence and administration of 
Police Department which deal with internal and departmental 
mechanism to put the things in order and they cannot add 
anything or supply omissions in Cr.P.C.?” 
 
Matter was related to police functions, therefore, Mr. Kamran 
Adil, DIG/City Police Officer, Faisalabad was also appointed as 
amicus curiae.  

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                6 
 
7. 
    Mr. Burhan Moazzam Malik along with Mian 
Tabassum Ali Advocates (learned amici curiae) in order to 
answer the above queries of the Court submits that there are 
two books for recording information of crime by the police; 
section 154 & 155 Cr.P.C., talk about entering of information 
with respect to cognizable & non-cognizable offences in 
separate books which cannot be the same. He further submits 
that it is undesirable to enter substance of information in 
cognizable cases first in the station diary and then in register of 
FIR, rather officer in charge of police station has no other 
option except to record the information directly in the register 
of FIR. In support of his contentions, he has mainly relied on 
“Lalita Kumari v. Govt. of U.P. & Ors.” (AIR 2014 Supreme 
Court 187). According to him, entering of information for 
cognizable and non-cognizable offences has elaborately been 
discussed in the Indian jurisdiction through the said judgment 
which is parametria to the provisions of law available in 
Pakistan. He further submits that in year 1861 not only Police 
Act was enacted but first version of Code of Criminal 
Procedure 1861 as well. Section 44 of Police Act deals with 
station/general diary to be kept by the officer in charge of 
police station for recording of information referred in such 
section. According to section 139 of Code of Criminal 
Procedure 1861, every complaint or information preferred to an 
officer in charge of a Police Station shall be reduced to writing 
and the substance thereof shall be entered in a diary to be kept 
by such officer in such form as shall be prescribed by the Local 
Government. In second version of Code of Criminal Procedure 
1872, section 139 was swapped with section 112 which 
mentioned that every complaint preferred to an officer in charge 
of a police-station shall be reduced into writing, and shall be 
signed, sealed, or marked by the person making it; and the 
substance thereof shall be entered in a book to be kept by such 
officer in the form prescribed by the Local Government. The 
two versions carry different features; in earlier version, section 
139 Cr.P.C. talks about entering of “information and 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                7 
 
complaints” in a diary; whereas second version of Code 
pursuant to Section 112 talks about entering of “complaint” 
only and that too not in diary but in a book. Similarly, third 
version of Code of Criminal Procedure 1882 talks about 
entering of only “information” in a book, and same is the 
position in section 154 of latest version of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure 1898. Learned amicus curiae stated that word 
“information” has not been qualified with “credible” or 
“reasonable” which shows intention of legislature that every 
information wrong may be, must be entered in a book/register 
of FIR if it discloses commission of a cognizable offence. He, 
however, could not explain that since promulgation of Police 
Act 1861 up to framing of Police Rules in the year 1934 what 
format was being used for the purpose of registration of FIR; 
whether information was being entered in police station daily 
diary maintained under section 44 of Police Act 1861 or any 
other book prescribed by the Local Government or the 
Provincial Government under section 154 of Cr.P.C. All other 
amici curiae also could not explain arrangement of registration 
of FIR in such period. However, all have consensus that after 
framing of Police Rules 1934 now FIR is registered on the 
format prescribed under Rule-24.5(1) Police Rules 1934. Mr. 
Burhan Moazzam, learned amicus curiae, however, in the last 
submission stated that system requires that information first be 
recorded in daily diary and then in register of FIR.  
 
8. 
Mr. Kamran Adil, DIG, learned amicus curiae states that 
our system is victim centric and rights of the accused are not 
protected, therefore, any information received to the police is 
registered as FIR without examining the sensitivity of the 
matter. System is loaded with frivolous applications and there is 
no mechanism to filter them at early stage. Once the FIR is 
registered, it takes years to get it cancelled if the information is 
found false. While arguing above point, he has referred the 
crime data of Pakistan since 1947 to date and then a bifurcation 
of all the provinces from year 2019 to 2023 which is as under: -  
 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                8 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                9 
 
 
 
 
He was of the view that crime data index shows that despite 
increase in population, crime rate in the country raised by three 
times since independence, and the bifurcation of last five years 
shows that most of the crime was reported in Province of the 
Punjab. He submits that data shows only number of cases 
registered and not the actual reporting and Punjab leads the other 
provinces for honouring the complaints for registration of FIRs. 
He while criticizing other amici curiae said that much talk and 
emphasis is on the textual interpretation and no logical 
interpretation of section 154 of Cr.P.C., is being tabled before 
this Court. He stated that pursuant to judgment reported as 
“INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF POLICE, PUNJAB, LAHORE AND 
OTHERS versus MUSHTAQ AHMAD WARRAICH AND OTHERS” 
(PLD 1985 Supreme Court 159) the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan has given protection to Police Rules though in service 
matters but it would be considered as a whole a sacrosanct 
document duly supported with legislative backing. According to 
him Inspector General of Police was authorized under section 12 
of the Police Act 1861 to make rules consistent with the Act. 
However, Rules are subservient to the Cr.P.C. which cannot 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                10 
 
surpass or override it but are used as a supplement to support 
Cr.P.C.; therefore, would well be read while interpreting section 
154 Cr.P.C. He further states that there is a time lag between 
entering of information and making of mind as to the 
commission of a cognizable offence, which requires a 
preliminary inquiry because police station is not a post office 
where FIR be reciprocated to an application filed on the whims 
and wishes of informant, rather a statutory duty cast upon the 
officer in charge of police station to apply his mind so as to save 
the innocent persons from sufferings and curtailment of liberties 
if the FIR stood registered. He urged that this area also requires 
consideration by this Court and it is the high time for updated 
interpretation of relevant laws and rules as held by Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in “MEERA SHAFI Versus ALI ZAFAR” (PLD 
2023 Supreme Court 211) and by High Court in Crl. Misc. 
40397/24 titled “Rai Muhammad Aslam Vs The State etc.” 
(2024 LHC 4993) (LHC website). He has further informed that 
similar kind of legislation is pending consideration before the 
Federal Cabinet.  
 
9.    Ms. Nuzhat Bashir, learned Deputy Prosecutor-General as 
amicus curiae entered appearance by filing her written 
submissions, and while addressing the questions stated that in 
Pakistan, the Police Rules 1934, issued under the Police Act of 
1861 (Now Police Order 2002), serve as a procedural framework 
for registering cases. Rule 22.47 of the Police Rules 1934 
specifies the maintenance of First Information Report Register 
on Form 24.5(1) for entering information under Section 154 
Cr.P.C. Similarly, for non-cognizable cases under Section 155 
Cr.P.C., the Daily Diary Register (Roznamcha) is maintained 
under Rule 22.48 of Police Rules 1934. However, Provincial 
Governments have not consistently updated these rules or issued 
specific 
additional 
notifications 
prescribing 
the 
"book" 
mentioned in Cr.P.C. Instead, the colonial-era framework 
remains the primary guideline. The procedural continuity of 
these rules has been accepted without question, though some 
provinces like Punjab and Sindh have digitized the FIR process 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                11 
 
via initiatives like the Police Record Management Information 
System (PRMIS). 
        She states that in India, similar provisions exist under 
section 154 and section 155 Cr.P.C., and corresponding rules are 
found in the “Police Regulations” of various States. For 
instance, States like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Tamil 
Nadu have issued rules prescribing an FIR Register for 
cognizable cases and a General Diary (GD) for non-cognizable 
cases. The Indian Police Act 1861 along with State specific 
Police Manuals and Government Orders, addresses the 
procedural requirements for the "book" mentioned in the Cr.P.C. 
Notably, after the Indian Supreme Court's judgment in Lalita 
Kumari v. Government of Uttar Pradesh of year 2013 
reported in year 2014, emphasis was placed on strict adherence 
to the registration of FIRs under Section 154 Cr.P.C., prompting 
states to revise or reaffirm their rules.  
          She words that the Police Rules 1934 do not "surpass" the 
provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure; rather, it 
complements and implements them within the framework 
allowed by law. However, the question about their authority and 
the relationship with the Cr.P.C., requires understanding of 
hierarchy of laws and delegated legislation. Hierarchy of Laws 
in both Pakistan and India explains that the Cr.P.C., is a central 
statute enacted by the legislature; it provides the primary 
framework for criminal procedure, and the Police Rules are 
subordinate or delegated legislation. They derive their authority 
from statutes like the Police Act 1861 (now Police Order 2002) 
and are meant to operationalize and regulate police conduct, 
including the procedures under Cr.P.C. Subordinate legislation, 
such as the Police Rules, cannot conflict with or override the 
provisions of the Cr.P.C. If there is a conflict, the provisions of 
the Cr.P.C. will prevail because it is the higher law. She while 
referring para-10 of case reported as “MUHAMMAD BASHIR 
Versus STATION HOUSE OFFICER, OKARA CANTT and others” 
(PLD 2007 Supreme Court 539), states that First Information 
Report (F.I.R.) was not an expression of the Code of Criminal 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                12 
 
Procedure, 1898 but was in fact the name given to the 
"Information" mentioned in section 154 of the Cr.P.C., by 
Chapter XXIV of the Police Rules of 1934. Further states that 
since the Police Rules prescribe these registers to operationalize 
the provisions of the Cr.P.C., they do not conflict with it. Rather, 
they provide the procedural clarity that the Cr.P.C. itself leaves 
to the Provincial/State Governments. Police Rules cannot 
surpass or override the Cr.P.C., but they can supplement it, 
provided they remain within the scope of the enabling legislation 
e.g., the Police Act 1861 (now Police Order 2002) and do not 
contravene the provisions of the Cr.P.C. In this case, the Cr.P.C. 
mandates maintaining a record of information in a "book" 
without detailing its format or specifics, the Police Rules fill in 
the procedural gap by prescribing the FIR register and daily 
diary as the appropriate "books." This prescription does not 
contradict the Cr.P.C.; instead, it supports its implementation.  
       Further passionate response was outlined by her that where 
the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C.) does not directly 
regulate a process, it can be supplemented or controlled by 
subordinate legislation, such as the Police Rules 1934 provided 
these rules adhere to the principles like, legitimacy of 
Subordinate Legislation. Such rules function as delegated 
legislation, deriving their authority from the parent statute 
(Police Act/Order) and serve to operationalize both the Act and 
related provisions of the Cr.P.C. The Police Order 2002, 
explicitly allows the Provincial Governments to make rules 
regulating police functions. Article 186 of the Police Order 
2002, provides for the continuity of the rules made under the 
Police Act 1861, unless explicitly repealed or amended. Hence, 
the Police Rules 1934 continue to apply where consistent with 
the Police Order and Cr.P.C. Section 154 Cr.P.C., mandates 
maintaining a "book" for recording of FIRs but does not specify 
the format or procedural details. The Police Rules 1934 
prescribe the format of FIR Register [24.5(1)]. Section 172 
Cr.P.C. requires the investigating officer to maintain a Case 
Diary but leaves the specifics to subordinate legislation. The 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                13 
 
Police Rules detail the structure and use of the case diary, define 
the chain of command and responsibilities in the investigation 
process, procedural details for reporting and managing crime 
statistics. The rules can supplement procedural gaps left by the 
Cr.P.C., but cannot introduce substantive law, as this requires 
legislative authority. This delegation is lawful because the 
Cr.P.C., permits Provincial Governments to prescribe procedural 
specifics. Courts in both Pakistan and India have upheld the role 
of subordinate legislation like the Police Rules in supplementing 
procedural aspects of criminal law, as long as they do not 
contradict 
higher 
laws. 
While 
referring 
para-26 
of 
“MUHAMMAD BASHIR Versus STATION HOUSE OFFICER, 
OKARA CANTT and others” (PLD 2007 Supreme Court 539), 
states that rules are always subordinate to the statutory 
provisions and no rule can permit what was not allowed by a 
statutory provision. 
 
          She lastly tabled the submissions that the Police Rules 
1934 were primarily framed to regulate the superintendence and 
administration of the police department. However, the 
relationship between the Police Rules and the Criminal 
Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) is nuanced, as the rules often intersect 
with procedural requirements under the Cr.P.C. The primary 
purpose of the Police Rules is to govern the internal and 
administrative mechanisms of the police department (e.g., 
hierarchy, discipline, and resource allocation). These regulate 
how the police carry out their duties, including investigation, 
maintenance of records, and interaction with the judicial 
process. While the Police Rules primarily deal with 
administrative mechanisms, they often serve as a procedural 
supplement to the Cr.P.C., in areas where the latter is silent or 
delegates responsibility as highlighted above. However, Police 
Rules cannot legislate or supply omissions in the Cr.P.C. that 
involve substantive law or fundamental procedural safeguards.

General appeared in representation of Prosecutor-General

W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                14 
 
and white which carry expression that there are two separate 
books; Register of FIR is for section 154 and Station diary 
register is for section 155 and they were legally prescribed 
through Police Rules. Police Rules cannot surpass or override 
the provisions of Cr.P.C rather supplement it and are not in 
conflict with the Cr.P.C. In the report of Prosecutor-General, 
Rules 24.1, 24.2, 24.3, 24.4 & 24.5 of Police Rules 1934 were 
cited in support of queries of this Court. Case reported as 
“MUHAMMAD BASHIR Versus STATION HOUSE OFFICER, 
OKARA CANTT and others” (PLD 2007 Supreme Court 539) 
was also cited with the submissions that no preliminary inquiry 
can be held before registration of FIR. However, in certain 
circumstances, with a limited scope inquiry held by the police 
shall not be illegal. In this respect he cited the cases reported as 
“FAISAL HAYAT Versus ADDITIONAL SESSIONS JUDGE/EX-
OFFICIO JUSTICE OF PEACE, ISLAMABAD (WEST) and 3 
others” (2024 Y L R 1037). “GUL NAWAZ LONE ETC versus 
S.H.O” (K.L.R. 1991 Criminal Cases 258). He says that Police 
Rules may fill procedural gaps where the Cr.P.C. is silent, they 
must remain within their legal limits and cannot supersede 
statutory provisions of Cr.P.C. Rules are subordinate and 
delegated legislation, deriving authority and legal cover from 
provisions of main statute and cannot override provisions of the 
Statute. Rules are meant to deal with details and can neither be a 
substitute for fundamentals of parent statute nor can add to them. 
Delegated legislation forms an important part of statutory law, 
which expounds and explains skeleton principles of parent 
statute in order to achieve purposes of such legislation. Reliance 
in this respect was placed on case reported as “COMMISSIONER 
INLAND REVENUE, LAHORE Versus COCA COLA PAKISTAN 
LIMITED, LAHORE” (2022 PTD 1400). He stated that Police Act 
1861 and Rules made thereunder even before enactment of 
present version of Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 has duly 
been given protection under section 3(1) of Code of Criminal 
Procedure 1898 because it states that in every enactment passed 
before this Code comes into force in which reference is made to, 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                15 
 
or to any Chapter or section of the Code of Criminal Procedure 
Act XXV of 1861 or Act X Of 1872, or Act X of 1882, or to any 
other enactment repealed, such, reference so far as may be 
practicable be taken to be made to this Code or to its 
corresponding chapter or section. 
 
11.   Proponents were heard at length who have given valuable 
input on the subject as highlighted above. It was the consensus 
of all the amici curiae that book mentioned in section 154 of 
Cr.P.C., is the register of FIR whereas under section 155 of 
Cr.P.C., is the Police Station daily diary. It was a further 
consensus that Police Rules being subordinate legislation is a 
legal document which derive their authority under Police Act 
1861 (Now Police Order 2002), they are not in conflict with 
Cr.P.C., nor they can surpass or over ride it, rather supplement, 
complement or implement the provisions of Cr.P.C., and rules 
making authority vested in Government has rightly been 
responded through Police Rules and it is not an intrusion in to 
provisions of Cr.P.C., because for prescribing book for section 
154 & 155 there is no rule making power in Cr.P.C. It was also 
the consensus that though Police Rules primarily deal with 
administrative mechanisms yet they often serve as a procedural 
supplement to the Cr.P.C., in areas where the latter is silent or 
delegates responsibility as highlighted above. Thus, these rules 
would help understand the legal concept of Section 154 & 155 
of Cr.P.C.   
 
12.     In order to ascertain the nature of books mentioned in 
sections 154 & 155 of Cr.P.C., it is essential to track the 
legislative history of registration of FIR in the light of provisions 
of Code of Criminal Procedure. Before I should talk about Code 
of Criminal Procedure, it is essential to note that General Code 
for Crimes was drafted on the recommendations of the first Law 
Commission of India established in 1834 under the Charter Act 
of 1833, under the chairmanship of  Thomas Babington 
Macaulay, a British historian, poet, and Whig politician, who 
served as the Secretary at War between 1839 and 1841, and as

the Paymaster General between 1846 and 1848. He also played a 
substantial role in determining India's education policy. Title of 
such Code was ‘Indian Penal Code’ enacted and assented by 
Governor-General on 06th October, 1860, about 10 months after 
the death of Thomas Babington Macaulay. (28th December, 
1859). It came into force in the sub-continent during the British 
Rule on 1st January, 1862. However, it did not apply 
automatically in the Princely States, which had their own Courts 
and legal systems until the 1940s. 
 
 
13.    The word ‘police’ is derived from the Greek word ‘Polis’, 
which means a city. The Latin term ‘Politeia’, refers to the State 
or government’s condition. In Ancient India, Rig Veda and 
Atharva Veda identify specific types of crimes known to the 
Vedic people at the time. The security personnel were in place 
as far back as the Harrapan period. It is not exactly known what 
type of criminal justice system existed during the Vedic period, 
although the Mauryan period has many of the same traits. The 
Arthashastra of Kautilya (310 BC) is a work on the 
administration of justice. The Muslim rulers have also 
implemented the Islamic principles and dealt the non-Muslims 
as per their own law. The pious Caliph Hazarat Umar (R.A) 
appointed officials "Ahdath" (police officers) to maintain public 
order and overseeing market activities. This role evolved into a 
specialized institution known as "Hisbah" later. He also 
appointed Governors to different states to control law and order 
i.e Abu Hurairah (R.A.) at Bahrain, Amr ibn al-Aas (R.A.) at 
Egypt and Ubadah ibn al-Samit (R.A.) at Syria. Prior to 
emergence of British Rule, the system of policing in Mughal 
India was organized on the basis of land tenure. The public 
peace disturbers were apprehended through Zamindars and at 
village level this function was performed by the Village 
Headmen. Similarly, in large towns, this function was performed 
by Kotwals, performing duties of law enforcement, municipal 
administration and revenue collection. Violent organized crime 
was usually dealt with by the military. The British 
administration introduced Magistrates with Daroghas. The 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                17 
 
modern police force came into existence in 19th century during 
the British period as a regular police force. The first police 
model was introduced by Sir Charles Napier in Sindh drawing 
inspiration from the Irish Constabulary, developed a separate 
and self-contained police organization for the province. 
However, the British Indian Government established a Police 
Commission in 1860 following the first war of the uprising in 
1857. The Police Commission of 1860 recommended the 
abolition of the Military Arm of the Police. Upon the 
recommendations of the Commission, the Government of India 
submitted a bill which was passed into law as Police Act 1861 
(Act V of 1861), the first codified central law. Section 12 of 
Police Act 1861 empowered the Inspector General to frame 
Rules for the administration of police force. The Police Act 1861 
did not come into existence at once but was to be adopted by the 
States later on. Prior to the Punjab Police Rules 1934 State level 
Rules were framed at Bengal and United Provinces under the 
name of Police Regulations. In the case of “QUEEN-EMPRESS 
V. ABDULHUSSAIN” (1887 ILR Cal 194) the Calcutta High 
Court observed the non-existence of rules which were to be 
framed under section 12 of the Police Act 1861.  The partition of 
Bengal in year 1905 led to the preparation of the ‘Eastern 
Bengal and Assam Police Manual’ which was published 
between the years 1910 and 1912. In the meantime, the Bengal 
Police Manual has been revised and was published for the 
districts of West Bengal in 1911. With the amalgamation of the 
provinces in 1912, Mr. A. E. O’ Sullivan, Superintendent of 
Police, was placed on special duty in 1913 to amalgamate the 
Rules in two manuals and to revise and to amplify them where 
necessary and bring them up to date by the inclusion of all 
Police and Government Orders issued since the last publication 
was issued. After seven months’ work Mr. O’ Sullivan’s duty 
was taken over and completed by Mr. J. E. Armstrong, 
Superintendent of Police, which contained police order and 
government orders up to the date of September 1914. It was 
decided to call compilation as “Police Regulations, Bengal” on

the analogy of “Army Regulations, India and of “Police 
Regulations, United Provinces”. These Regulations were of year 
1915. Which remained on updating time to time.  
 
14.     Police Act was promulgated on 22nd March, 1861 which 
introduced section 44 as regulator to record every information 
including commission of an offence in a general diary to be kept 
by officer in charge of police station. It is referred as under;  
“44. It shall be the duty of every officer in charge of a police-
station to keep a general diary in such form as shall from time to 
time, be prescribed by the Local Government and to record 
therein all complaints and charges preferred, the names of all 
persons arrested, the names of the complainants, the offences 
charged against them, the weapons or property that shall have 
been taken from their possession or otherwise, and the names of 
the witnesses who shall have been examined.”  
 
      The Magistrate of the district shall be at liberty to call for and 
inspect such diary. 
 
(Later in year 1937 the word “Local Government” was replaced with “Provincial Government”) 
 
This was the first document to record the information relating to 
commission of every offence in a General Diary. In the same 
year, for initiation, commencement and trial of offences Code of 
Criminal Procedure was legislated and assented by the 
Governor-General on 5th September, 1861; section 445 of the 
Code, fixed the date of operation of law as 1st day of January, 
1862 in the presidencies of Bengal, Madras, and Bombay except 
in any part of the territories in British India not subject to the 
General Regulations of Bengal, Madars, or Bombay until shall 
be extended by the Governor-General of India in Council, or by 
the Local Government to which such territory is subordinate, 
and until such extension shall have been notified in the Gazette. 
The crime reporting mechanism was enacted through section 
139 of such Code which is as under; 
“139. Every complaint or information preferred to an Officer in 
charge of a Police Station, shall be reduced into writing, and the 
substance thereof shall be entered in a diary to be kept by such 
Officer, in such form as shall be prescribed by the Local 
Government.” 
 
Such section talks about preference of every ‘complaint’ or 
‘information’ to officer in charge of police station but does not 
speak about commission of any cognizable or non-cognizable 
offence, because till then Indian Penal Code was not enforced in

the sub-continent which was made effective since 1st January, 
1862, the date when the Code of Criminal Procedure 1861 was 
also to be operationalized as per section 445. Therefore, in order 
to meet the requirement of section 139 of Cr.P.C., Bengal Police 
Rules were framed after promulgation of Code of Criminal 
Procedure 1861 which explained the mechanism for recording of 
information in cognizable offences. Excerpts of Chapter titled 
“FIRST INFORMATION REPORT” available online as 
appendix-D with version of Code of Criminal Procedure 1861 
on website https://books.google.com.pk/books, are referred. Rule-I of 
such Chapter is as under; 
I. 
Section 139 of the Code of Criminal Procedure clearly 
depicts that “every complaint or information preferred to an 
Officer in charge of a Police Station shall be reduced into writing” 
and this is quite independent of after-order directing substance of 
the complaint to be entered in the Diary. The Form given in 
Appendix No. I. is to be used in future in all districts. 
     
Form given in Appendix. I. was for recording complaint or

Note. – The signature, seal or mark of the informant shall be affixed at the foot of the 
information and shall be attested by the signature of the officer recording the 
"first information". 
 
15.     It was the mandate of Benal Police Rules that the first 
part of the Form was to be filled by the officer in charge of the 
Police Station, and the second part should be verbatim the 
report brought to the Police Station (Rule-II) or if the 
complaint is given in writing, the original paper should be 
attached to the Form, and the second part not written. This part 
should always be signed by the person giving the information 
(Rule-XIV), which shall be numbered consecutively in each 
Police Station monthly (Rule-VI). Copies of such form shall be 
sent to District Superintendent and officer in charge of Sub-
District for submission before the Magistrate of District. One 
copy with final report to Magistrate trying the offence.  
            If above Rules are read in the light of section 139 of 
Code of Criminal Procedure 1861, the scheme of law becomes 
clear that information in full shall be recorded in Form. I. when 
it discloses commission of cognizable offence and its substance 
in General Diary maintained at the Police Station under section 
44 of Police Act. Thus, section 139 of Code of Criminal 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                21 
 
Procedure 1861 (now 154) from the very beginning does not 
disclose any other separate book for registration of FIR in 
cognizable offence rather left it to the Police to frame rules for 
its internal functioning, however, every official act for recording 
of information about cognizable offence must be reflected in 
general diary as a proof that certain complaint or information 
was received and processed in the manner as required by regime 
of law on the subject.  Rule-IV of Bengal Police Rules also says 
to the following effect: 
“Every cognizable case reported to the Police, no matter 
whether it afterwards turns out a false charge or not, whether it 
be a heinous offence or a petty one, is to be reported in the 
above form. If the Magistrate directs a cognizable case to be 
investigated by the Police, and the Police Officer has not 
received any previous information regarding the crime, and has 
not already sent in these forms, he shall, on receipt of the 
Magistrate’s order, do so.” 
 
This rule shows mandatory recording of information. However, 
Rule XVIII explains that the practice of cancelling reports 
should be avoided; that is to say, if the first information of a 
crime is sent in a report, and half an hour after despatch of the 
report it is found that information was entirely false, the number 
should be left, and the next case reported in the next consecutive 
number. (Cancellation of case is still not the prerogative of Police rather of 
Magistrate a per rule 24.7 of Police Rules 1934). Rule-XIX from above 
Chapter of Bengal Police Rules however, deprecates recording 
of rumours in above Form, it is as under; 
“Vague rumours of crime said to have been committed should 
not be reported in this form, but should be mentioned in the 
Station Diary.” 
 
16.   Second version of Code of Criminal Procedure was 
promulgated and assented on 25th April, 1872 (the year when 
Evidence Act 1872 was also promulgated) but operationalization 
date was fixed as first day of September, 1872, new version 
replaced section 139 with section 112 which is as under; 
 
“112. Every complaint preferred to an officer in charge of a 
Police-station shall be reduced into writing, and shall be 
signed, sealed, or marked by the person making it; and the 
substance thereof shall be entered in a book to be kept by such 
officer in the form prescribed by the Local Government.” 
 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                22 
 
This section had somewhat changed the complexion of section 
139 of earlier Code in a way that now word “information” was 
deleted and only ‘complaint’ was used to report the crime and 
‘general diary’ was replaced with a “book”, and a requirement 
of signed, sealed, or marked by the person making it was also 
introduced. It seemed that such changes were made in order to 
further formalize the process of recording of information and 
giving it a permanent documented feature so as to avoid 
tempering with record and to use it as an admissible form of 
evidence pursuant to promulgation of Evidence Act 1872 
because section-35 of Evidence Act 1872 stated that an entry in 
any public or other official book, register, stating a fact in 
issue or relevant fact, and made by a public servant in the 
discharge of his official duty, or by any other person in 
performance of a duty specially enjoined by the law of the 
country in which such book or register, is kept, is itself a 
relevant fact. The third version of Code of Criminal Procedure 
was enacted and assented by Governor-General on 6th March, 
1882, made effective from first day of January, 1883. It enacted 
section 154 for information into cognizable cases which was 
exactly the same as the present-day section 154 of Code of 
Criminal Procedure 1898, with only difference of Local and 
Provincial Government.  
 
17.  Police Regulations, Bengal 1915 also dealt with first 
information of cognizable crime mentioned in section 154 of 
the Cr.P.C. Rule 71(a) says that such information shall be 
drawn up in P.R.B Form No. 228 and police officers shall not 
defer drawing up the information report until they have tested 
the truth of the complaint. They shall not await the result of 
medical examination before recording a first information, when 
complaint is made of grievous hurt or other cognizable crime 
(71-f). First information reports, once recorded, shall on no 
account be cancelled by station officers. (71-h). 
 
     Rule 75 says that the general diary is the book prescribed 
under section 155, Criminal Procedure Code, 1898, for the 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                23 
 
entry of all information received in respect of non-cognizable 
offences. The Rule 138 (a) says that the general diary in the P. 
R. B. Form No. 241 is prescribed under section 44, Act V of 
1861. It shall be kept at all police-stations, beat houses and 
section houses. Rule 138(b) says that every occurrence which 
may be brought to the knowledge of the officers of police shall 
be entered in the general diary at the time at which it is 
communicated to the station, and if no incident be 
communicated during the day, this fact shall be noted in the 
diary before it is closed and despatched. What was the structure

18.  Rule 87 in CHAPTER-IX Part-II of Police Regulations, 
United Provinces (corrected and amended up to year 1928), 
says that whenever information relating to the commission of a 
cognizable offence is given to an officer in charge of a police 
station, the report should immediately be taken down in 
triplicate in the check receipt book for reports of cognizable 
offences (Police Form No. 341). This step should on no 
account be delayed to allow time for the true facts to be 
ascertained by a preliminary investigation, even if it appears 
untrue, the report must be recorded at once. If the report is 
made orally, the exact words of the person who makes it, 
including his answers to any questions that are put to him, 
should be taken down and read over to him; he must sign each 
of the three parts, or, if he cannot write, he must make his mark 
or thumb-impression. If a written report is received, an exact 
copy must be made, but the signature or mark of the messenger 
need not be taken. In all cases the officer in charge of the 
station must sign each of the three parts, and have the seal of 
the station stamped on each. The triplicate copy will remain in 
the book; the duplicate copy will be given to the person who 
makes the oral or brings the written report; the original will be 
sent forthwith through the Superintendent of Police to the 
Magistrate having jurisdiction with the original written report 
(if any) attached. The practice of delaying first information 
reports until they can be sent to headquarters attached to special 
or general diaries is contrary to the provisions of the Criminal 
Procedure Code and is prohibited. Rule 89 says that if an officer 
in charge of a police station receives an oral report of a 
cognizable offence when he is away from the station house, and 
wishes to begin the investigation at once and cannot dispense 
with the attendance of the person who made the report, he 
should take the report down in writing and, after having it 
signed or marked by the person who made it, should send it to 
the police station to be treated as a written report.  

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                25 
 
        Rule 91 says that when a report is made of a non-
cognizable offence, the important portions of the report should 
be recorded in the check receipt book for reports of non-
cognizable offences (Police Form No. 347). The informant 
should be required to sign or affix his mark to each of the two 
copies, and the duplicate copy should be given to him, the 
original remaining in the book. The substance of the report 
should be entered in the general diary and, if the report is in 
writing, the paper containing it should be attached to the diary. 
The informant should also be referred to the magistrate, as 
required by section 155 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.       
 
         This rule shows that information in non-cognizable 
offence was required to be recorded in Police Form No. 347, 
whereas to meet the requirement of section 155 of Cr.P.C., 
substance of report was to be entered in general diary on Form 
No. 217 as explained by Rule 278. Such rule says that diary 
should be a complete but brief record of the proceedings of the 
police, and of occurrence reported to them or which they have 
obtained information. Rule 279 mentions the matters must be 
recorded in the general diary, and sub-rule (14) requires entry 
of reports of all occurrence which under the law have to be 
reported or which may require action on the part of police or the 
Magistracy, or of which the district authorities ought to be 
informed. Interesting to note under above Rules, there were 
three books; i.e., Police Form No.341 (for cognizable cases), 
Police Form 347 (for non-cognizable cases) & Police Form 217 
(the general diary); a correct spirit of section 154 & 155 of 
Cr.P.C., which say that after reducing the information to 
writing, substance must be entered in a book, that of course was 
a general diary.  
 
19.   The analysis of the Police Regulations framed under the 
Police Act 1861 makes it clear that the Punjab Police Rules 
1934 are not a new legislation but took the current shape after 
passing through the evolutionary process, being experienced in 
different States, and government in order to meet the situation 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                26 
 
amended the rules from time to time. Even before framing of 
Police Rule 1934, Form of FIR 24.5(1) was also being used for 
drawing of FIR in such format. Some of the FIRs were also 
placed before the Court relating to year 1931 & 1932 with same 
format. Thus, a link of primary and secondary legislation is 
essential to achieve objectives. Primary legislation generally 
consists of statutes, also known as ‘acts', set out broad 
principles and rules, and delegate specific authority to an 
executive branch to make more specific laws under the aegis of 
the principal Act. Framing of rules is termed as Secondary 
Legislation which may be known as statutory instruments, 
delegated legislation, or simply, subordinate legislation and the 
form of which it is issued may be called Orders, Rules, 
Regulations, Schemes or Codes. Secondary legislation can be 
created where an Act of Parliament or primary legislation 
doesn’t specify the exact details of regulation, but delegates the 
authority, to create and modify this legislation, to a government 
department, with a less onerous process of scrutiny and 
implementation. The executive branch can then issue secondary 
legislation, creating legally enforceable regulations and the 
procedures for implementing them, and they are kept on 
changing without going for new statutory legislation.  
20.   Section 3 (1) of Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 says 
that in every enactment passed before this Code comes into 
force in which reference is made to, or to any chapter or section 
of, the Code of Criminal Procedure, Act XXV of 1861 or Act X 
of 1872, or Act X of 1882, or to any other enactment hereby 
repealed, such reference shall, so far as may be practicable, be 
taken to be made to this Code or to its corresponding chapter or 
section. Enactment does not mean mere an Act of Parliament in 
the form of Statute but does include regulations as defined in 
General Clauses Act 1897. Section 3 (17) of such Act is as 
under;                                
 
(17) “Enactment.” “enactment” shall include a Regulation (as 
hereinafter defined) and any Regulation of the Bengal, or 
Bombay Code, and shall also include any provision contained in 
any Act or in any such Regulation as aforesaid” 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                27 
 
 
Similarly, it has also been defined in Punjab General Clauses 
Act 1956. Section 2 (23) of such Act is as under; 
 
(23) “enactment” shall include an Ordinance and a Regulation 
and any provision contained in any Act, Ordinance or 
Regulation applicable in the Punjab;  
     
Thus, erstwhile Police Rules & Regulations which refer to the 
provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure 1861, 1872 or 1882 
can also be read along with present Police Rules for 
understanding the concept and spirit of sections 154 & 155 of 
Cr.P.C., in the light of questions framed above; sections are 
reproduced for reference as under; 
154. Information in cognizable cases. Every information 
relating to the commission of a cognizable offence if given 
orally to an officer in charge of a police-station, shall be 
reduced to writing by him or under his direction, and be read 
over to the informant ; and every such information, whether 
given in writing or reduced to writing as aforesaid, shall be 
signed by the person giving it, and the substance thereof shall 
be entered in a book to be kept by such officer in such form as 
the Provincial Government may prescribe in this behalf  
 
Provided that if the information is given by the woman against 
whom an offence under section 336B, section 354, section 
354A, section 376 or section 509 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 
1860 (Act XLV of 1860) is alleged to have been committed or 
attempted, then such information shall be recorded by an 
investigating officer in presence of a female police officer or a 
female family member or any other person with consent of the 
complainant, as the case may be:  
 
Provided further that if the information, given by the woman 
against whom an offence under section 336B, section 354, 
section 354A, section 376 or section 509 of the Pakistan Penal 
Code, 1860 (Act XLV of 1860) is alleged to have been 
committed or attempted, is distressed such information shall be 
recorded by an investigating officer at residence of the 
complainant or at a convenient place of the complainant's 
choice in presence of a police officer or family member or any 
other person with consent of the complainant, as the case may 
be. 
 
155. Information in non-cognizable cases: (l) When 
information is given to an officer incharge of a police station of 
the commission within the limits of such station of a non-
cognizable offence, he shall enter in a book to be kept as 
aforesaid the substance of such information and refer the 
informant to the Magistrate. 
 
(2) Investigation into non-cognizable cases. No police-officer 
shall investigate a non-cognizable case without the order of a 
Magistrate of the first or second class having power to try such 
case or send the same for trial to the Court of Session.  
 
(3) Any police-officer receiving such order may exercise the 
same powers in respect of the investigation (except the power 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                28 
 
to arrest without warrant) as an officer in charge of a police-
station may exercise in a cognizable case. 
 
The expression in section 154 Cr.P.C., clearly reflects two-
stage action by the officer in charge of a police station. First 
duty of officer incharge is to receive in writing every 
information relating to commission of cognizable offence or 
reduce into writing such information or get it written if given 
orally and it shall be signed by the person giving it. Second 
stage is entering of substance in a book to be kept by such 
officer in such form as the Provincial Government may 
prescribe in this behalf. Sections 154 and 155 Cr.P.C., do not 
talk about recording of information in a book rather entering of 
substance only. Recording of information and entering the 
substance of information are two distinct functions. Substance 
of course connotes a gist or summary whereas recording is 
verbatim of information received. Section 154 Cr.P.C., requires 
mere entering of substance in a book whereas FIR is always 
verbatim of written application or what is reduced to writing. 
Thus, information in full cannot be summarized until it is 
recorded somewhere and signed by the informant; therefore, 
book for recording information in full cannot be a book 
mentioned in section 154 Cr.P.C. Entering substance of 
information either under section 154 or 155 of Cr.P.C in a book 
prescribed by provincial government clearly connotes one and 
the only book i.e., “police station daily diary”. Rule 24.1 (1) 
of Police Rules, 1934 also identifies the said book in the same 
fashion which says that pursuant to Sections 154 and 155, Code 
of Criminal Procedure, every information relating to an offence, 
whether cognizable or non-cognizable, shall be recorded in 
writing by the officer incharge of a police station. Such Rule 
further explains that the distinction between the form of reports 
required by the above-mentioned two sections has been defined 
by the Punjab Chief Court (now High Court) as under; 
Every information covered by section 154, Criminal Procedure 
Code, must be reduced to writing as provided in that section and 
the substance thereof must be entered in the police station daily 
diary, which is the book provided for the purpose. It is only 
information which raises a reasonable suspicion of the 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                29 
 
commission of a cognizable offence within the jurisdiction of the 
police officer to whom it is given, which compels action under 
Section 157, Criminal Procedure Code. 
 
21.    Thus, for entering substance of information either of 
cognizable or non-cognizable offence, the prescribed book is 
police station daily diary. By the combined reading of above 
Rule and section 154 of Cr.P.C., it is not discernable as to 
where such information shall first be reduced to writing, if it is 
for commission of cognizable offence, whether in the Register 
of FIR or in Police Station daily diary because section 154 of 
Cr.P.C., and above Rule talk about only entering of substance 
in a book (daily diary). It is experienced that when any person 
reports the episode of crime, he does not narrate the facts in 
sequence; therefore, a duty lies on officer in charge of police 
station to align the information into a story. Even otherwise 
while recording such information he can also question the 
informant on different aspect of the case as mentioned in Rule 
24.1 (4) of Police Rules, 1934; which says that when it is 
necessary to question a person bringing information of the 
commission of an offence, special attention shall be paid to the 
following matters and the results of the inquires shall be clearly 
recorded in the first information report: -  
(a)  The source from which the information was obtained and the 
circumstances under which the informant ascertained the 
names of the offenders and witnesses (if any are mentioned).  
 
(b)   Whether the informant was an eye-witness to the offence.  
 
Therefore, in no case information could directly be entered into 
register of FIR. It is resolved that every oral information is first 
to be reduced to writing on a blank paper (or if received in 
writing), the substance whereof shall be entered in police 
station daily diary, that such & such information has been 
received in the police station for commission of an offence. 
Entering of substance in police station daily diary is like 
officially receiving an information, as usually done in every 
government department which keep a daily-daak register and 
number every application or information, then, it is placed 
before the concerned officer for an action on it. Similarly, 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                30 
 
officer in charge of police station also gives a rapt number to 
such information, and then becomes legally authorized to 
question the informant for further details in order to apply his 
mind on such officially documented information as to whether 
any cognizable offence has been committed or not. From 
information, if officer in charge of police station suspects 
commission of cognizable offence, he shall enter in full such 
information, with inquires made, in Register of FIR for an 
action under section 157 of Cr.P.C. Rule 24.1 (2) of Police 
Rules 1934  exactly connotes the same scheme that in every 
case in which the officer in charge of a police station, from 
information or otherwise, has reason to suspect the commission 
of an offence, which he is empowered under section 156, 
Criminal Procedure Code, to investigate, he shall enter in full 
such information or other intelligence as soon as practicable in 
the First Information Report Register, shall have each copy 
signed, marked or sealed by the informant, if present, shall seal 
each with the station seal, and shall dispose of the copies in 
accordance with rule 24.5, and if he abstains from investigation 
under either of the provisos to section 157 of the Code he shall 
submit the copy intended for the Magistrate through the 
Superintendent.  
 
22.     The above Rule also covers the situation when by his 
own knowledge (otherwise) commission of offence came into 
the notice of officer in charge who is bound to reduce to writing 
such information and source of knowledge, substance whereof 
in the daily diary and information in full in register of FIR if he 
suspects commission of cognizable offence. Rule 24.1(2) of 
Police Rules 1934 says that when the information is entered in 
register of FIR, at the same time a reference to such report 
shall be entered in the Station Diary, Register No. II. This rule 
requires entering of reference to report, which means that FIR 
bearing No. so & so has been registered as an official response 
to information earlier received in police station; whereas in 
Lalita Kumari Case Supra, it has been directed that 
information in cognizable offence first be recorded in Register 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                31 
 
of FIR and then substance of information be entered in General 
diary to meet the requirement of section 154 of Cr.P.C., which 
arrangement opposes to requirement of the above Rules. Even 
after registration of FIR, when the whole information has been 
documented,  reiterating the substance of information in police 
station daily diary will serve no useful purpose at all, rather 
reference of FIR in Police station daily diary expresses the fact 
that information earlier received has now been formalized into 
an FIR as it disclosed commission of a cognizable offence; that 
is the reason in every FIR in the column of date and time of 
reporting, it is mentioned by the police officer that “reference 
police station daily diary number”  usually written in vernacular 
as “وحباہل رٹپ ربمن” which means that with reference to information 
incorporated earlier in police station daily diary, this FIR is 
being registered.  Police station daily diary is known as Register 
No. II and is maintained in accordance with section 44 of the 
Police Act 1861 (Article 167 Police Order, 2002) as mentioned 
in Rule 22.48 of Police Rules 1934. Rule 22.49 of Police Rules 
1934 mentions what matters should be entered in police station 
daily diary. It includes as under; 
(n) A reference to every information relating to the commission 
of a cognizable offence, and action is taken under section 157, 
Code of Criminal Procedure, the number and date of the first 
information report submitted. 
                          
Sequence of facts in above rule is also in consonance with the 
conclusion drawn above; i.e., entering of information, 
suspecting cognizable offence, registration of FIR with number 
and date of first information report submitted to the senior 
police officer as mentioned in rule 24.5.  
 
23.   If the ratio of Lalita Kumari Case be accepted that 
information in cognizable offence first be recorded in Register 
of FIR followed by entering of substance in station diary, then 
on the eve of refusal by officer in charge of police station to 
register the FIR due to any reason, the substance of information 
could not also be entered in police station daily diary, and 
information brought by the messenger or aggrieved shall 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                32 
 
remain in air without any official receiving, so as to create an 
impression of delayed reporting due to  deliberation, 
consultation and concoction of story, one of the recognized 
grounds for acquittal of accused in the case. Whereas entering 
of information in police station daily diary in due time helps 
remove such doubts. Rule 138(b) of Police Regulations, Bengal 
was also to the same effect which says that every occurrence 
which may be brought to the knowledge of the officers of 
police shall be entered in the general diary at the time at which 
it is communicated to the station. If on information 
incorporated in police station daily diary, an FIR is not 
registered, matter can be reported to higher police officer under 
section 551 of Cr.P.C. who also enjoys the power of officer in 
charge of police station in that area, or to the ex. officio Justice 
of the Peace under section 22A/B of Cr.P.C. After registration 
of FIR, its reference in police station daily diary serves the 
purpose that an action has been taken officially on information 
earlier received in police station, as is done in every public 
office of government department through daily daak and 
dispatch register. This is also providing a legal shelter to the 
officer in charge of police station for recording reasons to 
refuse registration of FIR because not only Sessions Judge 
under Article 167 of Police Order 2002 is authorized to inspect 
the same but in some cases, information in daily diary can be 
also be requisitioned by the Court or forum where any such 
related issue is raised. 
 
24.    Similarly, if information about commission of non-
cognizable offence is received in writing or reduced to writing 
on a plain paper by officer in charge of police station, substance 
of such information shall be entered in police station daily diary 
and informant shall be sent to Magistrate for seeking 
permission to investigate the matter. If permission is received, 
then written application and entry of daily diary shall be 
annexed with case dairy, transforming it into a police file for 
investigation of case as per Rule 25.11of Police Rules 1934. 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                33 
 
Rule 24.3 of Police Rules 1934 relaters to entering of 
information in non-cognizable offences which says that where 
the information relates to a non-cognizable offence, it shall be 
briefly but intelligibly recorded in the station diary, shall be 
signed, sealed or marked by the person making it on both foil 
and counterfoil, and all particulars required by section 44 of Act 
V of 1861 shall also be noted. A copy of the entry in the diary 
made by the carbon copying process and signed and sealed with 
the station seal by the recording officer, shall be made over to 
the informant who shall be referred to the Magistrate in 
accordance with section 155, Code of Criminal Procedure. 
 
25.    The officer in charge of police station is required to apply 
his mind on the information as to whether it discloses 
commission of a cognizable offence. For this purpose, process 
of law has been kept very simple, which can be understood 
from the fact that officer in charge of the police station who is 
ordinarily a Sub-Inspector as per Rule 22.1 of Police Rules 
1934 but in his absence, can be any officer next in rank above 
the rank of constable as per section 4 (P) of Cr.P.C. Rule 22.77 
of Police Rules 1934 caters to the situation as under; 
22.77. Station clerk as officer in charge of police station. - In 
the absence of senior officers, the station clerk is frequently called 
upon to act as officer in charge of the police station. He must, 
therefore, be fully acquainted with all the powers, responsibilities 
and duties of that officer as laid down in the law and in Police 
Rules. The most important of these and the most important of the 
other duties devolving on the station clerk and not already 
detailed in this chapter are –  
 
(1) registration of cognizable cases and action subsequent to 
registration - Rule 24.1; (2) recording of complaints in non-
cognizable cases - Rule 24.3; (3) dispatch of special reports - 
Rule 24.12; (4) disposal and completion of case files and 
completion of registers on the passing of orders in cases - 
Rule 27.29; (5) carrying out arrests - Rule 26.8; (6) granting 
of bail - Rule 26.21; (7) submitting applications for remands 
to police custody - Rule 26.25(2); (8) patrolling at rural 
stations - Rule 23.1; (9) issuing orders on the use of handcuffs 
- Rule 26.23.  
 
In all these matters the station clerk will be guided by the rules 
referred to and connected law. 
 
However, it is not discernable from section 154 of Cr.P.C that 
for application of mind on information as to whether cognizable 
offence has been committed, is there any time lag or would it be 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                34 
 
done immediately because section 154 does not use the word “at 
once”. However, Rule 24.2 of Police Rules 1934 says that it 
should be done as soon as practicable. It was a shift because 
earlier as per Rule 87 of Government of United Provinces, 
Police Regulations (corrected and amended up to year 1928), the 
words “immediately & at once were used. Thus, where from 
information, owing to the change in genesis and novelty of 
crimes with the passage of time, any technical or legal support is 
required for understanding the ingredients of offence, any delay 
in entering the information into register of FIR would not be 
fatal, but fact of delay must be mentioned in police station daily 
diary. However, in a case reported as “GHULAM ABBAS V. THE 
STATE” (PLD 1968 Lahore 101), this Court has directed 
recording of information in the prescribed book soon upon its 
making. When from information no offence seems committed or 
wrong reporting is in the knowledge of police, such information 
shall not be entered in FIR register. Reliance in this respect is on 
a Division Bench judgment of Peshawar High Court reported as 
“SHAH REHMAN Versus THE STATE through Advocate-General 
and 2 others” (2003 MLD 714). In such situation information 
should only be entered in police station daily diary as an event 
that somebody reported the matter. It has been the practice of 
police since year 1861 as highlighted above in Bengal Police 
Rules framed just after 1861 and Police Regulations, Bengal 
1915 that vague rumours of crime said to have been committed 
should not be reported in the Form, but should be mentioned in 
the Station Diary. Para 71 (c) & (d) of Police Regulations, 
Bengal 1915 said that a vague information shall be distinguished 
from a hearsay report, which if received, station officer shall not 
wait to record, as the first information, the statement of the 
actual complainant or an eye witness.  
 
26.   It is trite that police station is not a post office to 
reciprocate with FIR on whims and wishes of informant rather 
as per rule 24.1 (2) Police Rule, 1934 read with section 157 of 
Cr.P.C. when the officer in charge of police station has reason to 
suspect commission of cognizable offence, then he shall enter 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                35 
 
the information in register of FIR, but first it would be entered in 
police station daily diary. The case reported as “GUL NAWAZ 
LONE ETC vs S.H.O” (K.L.R. 1991 Criminal Cases 258) is 
also to the same effect; 
“It is thus evident that even an information apparently covered 
by Section 154 is first to be entered in the Station daily diary 
and it is only when the officer Incharge of the police station has 
reason to suspect the commission of a cognizable offence, that 
he is required to enter such information in the First Information 
Report Register. It is note-worthy that the word suspicion is 
preceded by the expression "reason", which would have a 
reference to the mind of the police officer and excludes the 
possibility of action founded on vague surmises. Rule 24.2 
therefore, calls for a determination by the police officer, dictated 
by reasons and rested on definite facts. Such determination may 
be anchored on evaluation of fact stated in the report, reviewing 
of the circumstances attending the case and intelligence relating 
to the alleged commission of the offence. Evidence mustered in 
the course of investigation of the case already registered may 
also furnish material for such determination. It is to be 
remembered that this determination should not be equated with 
investigation undertaken by the police officer after registration 
of the case. The expression sufficiently indicates that when the 
appellants rushed to this Court, the matter was still under 
scrutiny of the S.H.O, who was under a compulsion to proceed 
according to law. Mention in the " of the case registered at the 
instance of the appellants' rivals, is part of the factual narration 
rather than to betray a disinclination of the S.H.O, to entertain 
the appellants grievance.”  
 
In another case reported as 
“FAISAL 
HAYAT 
Versus 
ADDITIONAL SESSIONS JUDGE/EX-OFFICIO JUSTICE OF 
PEACE, ISLAMABAD (WEST) and 3 others” (2024 YLR 1037), 
Islamabad High Court has held that substance of information 
relating to cognizable offence be entered first in police station 
daily diary.  
  
27.   Form the above discussion, it is clear that the book 
mentioned in section 154 Cr.P.C. is not a register of FIR rather 
police station daily diary because said section requires entering 
of only substance in the book and not the information in full.  
Similarly, if information in writing is received, still it is the 
direction to enter only the substance and not the information as a 
whole. Moreover, above section talks about “every information” 
and not the “first information” which scopes recording of as 
many versions as there can be, but Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
a case reported as “Mst. SUGHRAAN BIBI Versus The STATE” 
(PLD 2018 Supreme Court 595) has barred the registration of 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                36 
 
second FIR, rather directed that every further information in a 
cognizable case shall be recorded through statement under 
section 161 of Cr.P.C. Likewise, during the same occurrence 
when multiple offences are committed by the parties against 
each other, no further information is materialized into 
registration of separate FIR but through cross version usually 
recorded in the police station daily diary. In such situation, shall 
it be gainsaying that entering of information of a cognizable 
offence in the police station daily diary opposes to the scheme of 
law so far settled. Another situation also gets attention that when 
a constable while being in police station receives an information 
of cognizable offence what will he do because he is not the 
officer in charge of police station. In such situation it was the 
direction that he shall enter abstract of such information in 
police station daily diary. [Para-71(g)] of Police Regulations, 
Bengal 1915 is referred in this respect. Before that a case 
reported aa “Queen-Empress vs Muhammad Ismail Khan” 
(1898) ILR 20 ALL 151), was also to the same effect wherein it 
was held by John Edge, C.J, and Burkit, J that Ismail Khan 
Constable was bound by law to enter in the general diary reports 
of cognizable or non-cognizable cases made to him at the thana. 
Para-138 (h) of Bengal Police Regulations 1915 mentioned that 
an entry in the general diary does not obviate the necessity of 
separate report of any occurrence which is required by rule or 
order to be specially reported.  
 
28.    If the officer in charge of police station from the 
information received or otherwise suspects commission of 
cognizable offence, he shall start the investigation, which means 
that it is the “information” that gives him power to enter into 
investigation and not the “registration of such information”. 
Relying upon case reported as “EMPEROR V. KHAWJA NAZIR 
AHMED” (AIR (32) 1945 Privy Council 18), it was held that 
investigation can be conducted the moment information is 
lodged before the officer in charge of police station. It is our 
everyday experience that police halt the persons for inspection 
and if something is found in his possession contrary to law, so as 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                37 
 
to suspect commission of a cognizable offence, police officer 
there and then starts investigating the matter despite the fact that 
FIR by then had not been registered, and it is a 
misunderstanding that accused can only be arrested after 
registration of FIR. Code of Criminal Procedure 1898, as per 
section 4 (f) mentions two terms “Cognizable offence.” & 
“Cognizable case.” Cognizable offence means an offence for, 
and cognizable case means a case in, which a police-officer, 
may, in accordance with the second schedule or under any law 
for the time being in force, arrest without warrant. A cognizable 
offence when stood registered become a cognizable case. Thus, 
a cognizable offence committed within the view of police officer 
authorizes him to arrest the offender there and then.  
 
29.   Similarly, on receiving information, if commission of 
cognizable offence is suspected, it shall as soon as may be 
practicable to be entered ultimately in the Register of FIR. A 
police file is prepared for every case which contains copy of 
written application or information reduced to writing (رفد ایبن) by 
the officer in charge of the police station, one copy of FIR and a 
case diary as per section 172 of Cr.P.C.; Rule 25.53(1) of Police 
Rules 1934 mentions that in such diary shall be recorded, 
concisely and clearly, the steps taken by the police, the 
circumstances ascertained through the investigation and the 
other information required by Section 172(1), Code of Criminal 
Procedure. As a first step the investigating officer shall get the 
information verified from the complainant or persons against 
whom offence has been committed, or if he receives any 
supplementary statement of complainant shall record its 
substance in case diary so as to pick another line of inquiry in 
the investigation of case. Practice of recording of supplementary 
statement was part of Police Regulations, United Provinces (as 
cited above).  Para- 98 of such Regulations explains as under; 
“The case diary must contain the particulars required by 
section 172 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in no more 
detail than is absolutely necessary to enable a supervising 
officer to understand the facts. A note should be made in it as 
to whether the complainant confirms his first information 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                38 
 
report, and the substance of any supplementary statement he 
makes to the investigating officer should be briefly 
recorded……………....”          
                                                                         (emphasis supplied) 
 
30.     It is trite that preliminary inquiry before registration of 
FIR is barred, but urge of Mr. Kamran Adil DIG, learned amicus 
curiae that updated construction of laws is essential in the light 
of “MEERA SHAFI Versus ALI ZAFAR” (PLD 2023 Supreme 
Court 211) & judgment passed in Criminal Miscellaneous 
No.40397-M/2024, titled  “Rai Muhammad Aslam Vs. 
Additional Sessions Judge, etc.” (2024 LHC 4993) (LHC 
Website) On the other hand, Mr. Burhaan Moazzam Malik, 
learned amicus curiae stated that there is no scope of preliminary 
inquiry before registration of FIR and it is well settled by 
different case laws of Pakistani jurisdiction yet the exhaustive 
judgment came from Indian jurisdiction reported as “Lalita 
Kumari Versus Govt. of U.P. & Ors.” (AIR 2014 Supreme 
Court 187), which thoroughly rules out the scope of preliminary 
inquiry; however, conceded that even in above said case, 
Supreme Court of India has given some situations, apart from 
statutory 
exception, 
where 
preliminary 
inquiry 
before 
registration of FIR is permissible, which are referred below; 
 
ii) If the information received does not disclose a cognizable 
offence but indicates the necessity for an inquiry, a preliminary 
inquiry may be conducted only to ascertain whether cognizable 
offence is disclosed or not. 
 
iii) If the inquiry discloses the commission of a cognizable 
offence, the FIR must be registered. In cases where preliminary 
inquiry ends in closing the complaint, a copy of the entry of such 
closure must be supplied to the first informant forthwith and not 
later than one week. It must disclose reasons in brief for closing 
the complaint and not proceeding further. 
 
iv)…………………………………………………………….. 
 
v) The scope of preliminary inquiry is not to verify the veracity or 
otherwise of the information received but only to ascertain 
whether the information reveals any cognizable offence. 
 
vi) As to what type and in which cases preliminary inquiry is to 
be conducted will depend on the facts and circumstances of each 
case. 
The category of cases in which preliminary inquiry may be 
made are as under: 
a) Matrimonial disputes/ family disputes 
b) Commercial offences 
c) Medical negligence cases 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                39 
 
d) Corruption cases 
e) Cases where there is abnormal delay/laches in initiating 
criminal prosecution, for example, over 3 months delay in 
reporting the matter without satisfactorily explaining the 
reasons for delay. 
The aforesaid are only illustrations and not exhaustive of all 
conditions which may warrant preliminary inquiry. 
vii) While ensuring and protecting the rights of the accused and 
the complainant, a preliminary inquiry should be made time 
bound and in any case it should not exceed 7 days. The fact of 
such delay and the causes of it must be reflected in the General 
Diary entry. 
viii) Since the General Diary/Station Diary/Daily Diary is the 
record of all information received in a police station, we direct 
that all information relating to cognizable offences, whether 
resulting in registration of FIR or leading to an inquiry, must be 
mandatorily and meticulously reflected in the said Diary and the 
decision to conduct a preliminary inquiry must also be reflected, 
as mentioned above. 
In above said Case, the Indian Supreme Court has rightly held 
that there is no scope of preliminary inquiry before registration 
of FIR. The highlighted situations mostly fall in statutory 
exceptions. However, in same situation, with this limited scope 
preliminary inquiry in our system should not be barred, 
particularly when unlike India we have given power to an ex-
officio Justice of the Peace for direction about registration of 
FIR, and that too after an inquiry by him as held in case reported 
as “YOUNAS ABASS and others Versus ADDITIONAL SESSIONS 
JUDGE, CHAKWAL and others” (PLD 2016 Supreme Court 
581) that an ex-officio Justice of the peace now enjoys quasi-
judicial powers which require him to call the parties and police 
comments, hear them, conduct an inquiry and then pass direction 
for or against registration of FIR.  
 
31.   The present writ petition for quashing of FIR revolves 
around mandatory preliminary investigation authorized under 
section 196B Cr.P.C., for offences mentioned in section 196 of 
Cr.P.C. to which section 295A PPC is a part. When such matter 
is reported to the officer in charge of police station, the first duty 
of police officer is to reduce such information to writing, and 
after entering the substance in police station daily diary shall 
apply his mind that which offence in fact seems committed from 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                40 
 
the information; if it spurs out that from the information offence 
under section 295A PPC is attracted,  he shall within the limited 
scope of inquiry shall collect further information and place the 
matter before officer in charge of investigation in the district for 
authorizing preliminary investigation. It is true that in other 
offences there is no concept of preliminary investigation as held 
in “SHAHNAZ BEGUM versus THE HON’BLE JUDGES OF THE 
HIGH COURT OF SIND AND BALUCHISTAN AND ANOTHER” 
(PLD 1971 Supreme Court 677) but the Supreme Court in 
above case while referring Cluse 22 of Letters Patent under 
which High Court was established held as under; 
“High Court under the latter part of the provisions of clause 22 of 
the Letters Patent has the power to direct the preliminary 
investigation to be started where no such investigation has already 
been initiated by even an officer B who in the ordinary course 
would not have had territorial jurisdiction to make such an 
investigation although he must still be an officer who is 
competent to make an investigation under the Criminal Procedure 
Code of an offence of that nature.” 
 
Clauses 22 of Letters Patent thus empowers the High Court to 
direct for preliminary investigation where no action in the form 
of registration of FIR or investigation has been taken by the 
police. Though section 196 Cr.P.C., since 1898 remained 
operating under ordinary regime of investigation as to 
cognizable or non-cognizable offences mentioned therein so as 
to evaluate the collected material for filing of complaint by 
Central or Provincial government yet High Court was 
established under such Letters Patent in year 1919 and Clause 22 
above was made available for that purpose or for preliminary 
investigation of other offences in appropriate cases till the 
enactment of section 196B Cr.P.C., by the Code of Criminal 
Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1923 (18 of 1923). Sections 196 & 
196B are reproduced as under; 
196. Prosecution for offences against the State. No Court shall 
take cognizance of any offence punishable under Chapter VI or 
IXA of the Pakistan Penal Code (XLV of 1860) (except section 
127), or punishable under section 108A, or section 153A, or section 
294A, or section 295A or section 505 of the same Code, unless 
upon complaint made by order of, or under authority from, the 
Federal Government, or the Provincial Government concerned, or 
some officer empowered in this behalf by either of the two 
Governments. 
  

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                41 
 
                                      (Section 295A PPC was inserted in above section by the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 
1927 (25 of 1927). 
 
196B. Preliminary inquiry in certain cases. In the case of any 
offence in respect of which the provisions of section 196 or section 
196A apply, officer-in-charge of the investigation in the district 
may, notwithstanding anything contained in those sections or in any 
other part of this Code, order a preliminary investigation by a 
police-officer not being below the rank of Inspector, in which case 
such police-officer shall have the powers referred to in section 155, 
sub-section (3).  
 
As per section 196 Cr.P.C., no Court shall take cognizance of 
offences mentioned therein unless upon complaint made by 
order of, or under authority from, the Federal Government, or 
the Provincial Government concerned, or some officer 
empowered in this behalf by either of the two Governments. 
Only four offences of PPC mentioned in section 196 Cr.P.C are 
cognizable; e.g., section 123B in Chapter VI of PPC, section 
171J in Chapter IXA, sections 153A & 505 of PPC. Though it is 
held in number of judgments that taking cognizance and 
registration of FIR are different phenomena; therefore, for 
cognizable offences mentioned in 196 Cr.P.C., FIR can be 
registered, but when special procedure has been prescribed for 
dealing with offences mentioned in section 196 Cr.P.C., then 
regime introduced in section 196B Cr.P.C., must be followed for 
preliminary investigation. It is trite that even without registering 
an FIR, investigation can be initiated. Instances are of situations 
when Magistrate orders for investigation under section 156(3) or 
section 202 of Cr.P.C. In “Lalita Kumari vs Govt. of U.P. & 
Ors” (AIR 2014 Supreme Court 187), Indian Supreme Court has 
held that pursuant to such direction of Magistrate, officer in 
charge of police station shall first register the FIR and then 
investigate the matter. What exactly has been directed is 
reproduced below; 
 
“10. From the foregoing discussion it is evident that whenever a 
Magistrate directs an investigation on a “complaint” the police has to 
register a cognizable case on that complaint treating the same as the 
FIR and comply with the requirements of the above Rules. It, 
therefore, passes our comprehension as to how the direction of a 
Magistrate asking the police to “register a case” makes an order of 
investigation under Section 156(3) legally unsustainable. Indeed, even 
if a Magistrate does not pass a direction to register a case, still in view 
of the provisions of Section 156(1) of the Code which empowers the 
police to investigate into a cognizable “case” and the Rules framed 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                42 
 
under the Indian Police Act, 1861 it (the police) is duty-bound to 
formally register a case and then investigate into the same. The 
provisions of the Code, therefore, do not in any way stand in the way 
of a Magistrate to direct the police to register a case at the police 
station and then investigate into the same.  
 
In our opinion when an order for investigation under Section 156(3) of 
the Code is to be made the proper direction to the police would be “to 
register a case at the police station treating the complaint as the first 
information report and investigate into the same”. 
I am afraid such direction opposes to erstwhile rules of Bengal 
Police. As per Rule-IV, upon receiving direction from Magistrate 
for investigation of cognizable offence, the information shall be 
entered in the Form only if police had not already received any 
information; it is as follows;   
If the Magistrate directs a cognizable case to be investigated by the 
Police, and the Police Officer has not received any previous 
information regarding the crime, and has not already sent in these 
forms, he shall, on receipt of the Magistrate’s order, do so.” 
Police Regulations, Bengal 1915; Para-76 (a) & (b) is also to the 
same effect, which is as under; 
(a) 
When a Magistrate directs the police to enquire into the 
complaint of a cognizable offence, of which no previous information 
has been laid before the police, the written information sent by the 
Magistrate to the police shall be treated as the first information. 
(b)    When such a complaint is referred for enquiry upon some 
specific point or points, the police shall submit an ordinary report not 
in the prescribed form.    
The above direction in Lalita Kumari Case for registration of 
FIR could only be carried out when police had not received prior 
information at police station about commission of cognizable 
offence and complaint is made to the Magistrate, and he without 
recording the statement of complainant under section 200 of 
Cr.P.C., directs the police for action under the law, (in our country, 
this function has also been assigned to an ex-officio Justice of the Peace) but 
once statement is recorded under section 200 of Cr.P.C., and 
Magistrate opts to go for inquiry or investigation under section 
202 of Cr.P.C., then there would be no scope of registration of 
FIR by the police rather investigation shall be carried out to 
collect the material for private prosecution, and in this case it 
can be claimed that an investigation in cognizable offence can 
be resorted to even without registration of FIR.  

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                43 
 
32.   It is trite that police cannot investigate a non-cognizable 
offence except by the order of Magistrate; similarly, police also 
cannot investigate the offences mentioned in section 196 of 
Cr.P.C. except by the order of officer in charge of investigation 
in the district. Earlier officer in charge of the investigation in the 
district was a District Magistrate; therefore, it is mentioned in 
Rule 25.11 of Police Rules 1934 that no police officer shall 
investigate a non-cognizable offence unless ordered to do so by 
a competent magistrate under sections 196B or 202, Criminal 
Procedure Code. however, now this authority vests in 
Superintendent of Police (Investigation) in the district. In the 
light of above discussion if an information is received at police 
station about commission of an offence, it shall be reduced to 
writing and then for officially documenting it enter the substance 
in police station daily diary, upon which it becomes imperative 
upon officer in charge of police station to apply his mind as to 
the commission of cognizable offence. If from the information 
commission of cognizable offence is not suspected police can 
collect further information, but while considering it a cognizable 
offence shall enter into register of FIR, then mere mentioning 
penal section of non-cognizable offence in FIR does not by itself 
provide grounds for its quashing, in particular when a legal 
opinion from concerned prosecutor or Prosecutor General can be 
sought for further proceedings. Learned Counsel for the 
respondent also submitted that like application for insertion of 
other penal provisions is pending before the SP investigation. 
Police has authority even to prepare case cancellation report 
later under Rule 24.7 of Police Rules 1934, if the offence 
ultimately turns out to be a non-cognizable. Though as per 
section 537 of Cr.P.C., any error in complaint shall not over turn 
any sentence, finding or order of the Court rather determination 
lies with the Court that it actually has occasioned the failure of 
justice. The reliance in respect is on cases reported as “ALTAF 
HUSSAIN versus ABDUL SAMAD and 3 others” (2000 SCMR 
1945); “MUHAMMAD Versus THE STATE” (1989 P Cr. L J 834). 
One of the finest judgments of this Court authored by His 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                44 
 
lordship Rustam S. Sidhwa. J as he then was, reported as 
“MUHAMMAD ASLAM versus The STATE And ANOTHER” (1980 
P Cr. L J 742) wherein it was held that if the investigation 
conducted by the police in non-cognizable offence was not 
authorized under section 155 (2) by the Magistrate, then the 
remedy is as follows;  
“8. I now turn to the submissions made by the learned counsel for 
the petitioner and the State as regards the question whether the 
investigation of a non-cognizable offence by a police officer not 
authorised under section 155 (2), Cr. P. C. to do so, prevents the 
Court from taking cognizance of the offence on the report submitted 
by such officer or renders the subsequent trial illegal. I need not 
labour, on those questions as they have been decided by a Division 
Bench judgment of the High Court of West Pakistan in Mst. 
Sadan v. The State (PLD1965 B.J 12), which judgment is binding 
on me. In this authority, it was held that a police report in a 
non-cognizable offence, which the police officer had not been 
duly ordered by a Magistrate to investigate. could be treated as 
a report falling under clause (b) of subsection (1) of section 190 
of the. Criminal Procedure Code or, in the alternative, as a 
complaint. falling under clause (a) of subsection (1) of the same 
section. It was also held in this case that the mere irregularity in the 
investigation of the case by the police officer who was not 
authorised to investigate the same, did not affect the legality of the 
trial. The Crown v. Mehar Ali (PLD 1956 FC 106) was also 
followed in this respect. The two rulings cited by the learned 
counsel for the petitioner, namely, Mst. Razia v. The State and 
Muhammad Yaqub v. The State (1977 P Cr. L J 328), do not, 
therefore, correctly lay down the law. In Mst. Razia's case which is 
a Single Bench judgment of this Court, the attention of the learned 
Judge was not drawn to Mst. Sadan's case. Likewise, in Muhammad 
Yaqoob's case, which is a Single Bench decision of the Sind High 
Court, the attention of the learned Judge was not drawn either to 
Mst. Sadan's case or to the other decisions of that Court, e.g., Shah 
Abdul Majid v. The State (1978 P Cr. L J 812), Wali zad v. State (P 
L D 1958 Kar. 86), and Mami v. The. State (PLD 1960 Kar. 204). 
Therefore, following the view taken in Mst. Sadan's case, I hold that 
the challan by the police officer in the present. case can be treated 
both as a report of a police officer or a complaint under clause (b) 
or clause (a) of subsection (1) of section 190 of the Criminal 
Procedure Code and that the cognizance of the same by the 
Magistrate cannot vitiate the trial before him.  
                     
There is no cavil that FIR if registered in non-cognizable offence 
can be quashed in the light of judgment relied by learned 
counsel for the petitioner but this judgment covers the situation 
that if in serious issue investigation is started without out 
authorization by Magistrate, still on the report of police officer 
Magistrate can take cognizance either under clause (a) or (b) of 
subsection (1) of section 190 Cr.P.C., then while framing charge 
if sanction for prosecution in offence under section 295A PPC is 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                45 
 
required as per section 196 Cr.P.C., then Magistrate can stay the 
proceedings until such sanction is received as ordained under 
section 230 of Cr.P.C. Even initiative of Magistrate at his own to 
take cognizance under section 190 (1)(c) of Cr.P.C. can 
regularize the process. Reliance in this respect is placed on cases 
reported as “SHAFIQ AHMAD versus The STATE” (PLD 1959 
(W.P.) Lahore 851); “AZIM KHAN AND ANOTHER versus The 
STATE” (1970 P Cr. L J 77). 
 
33.   In the present case report under section 173 of Cr.P.C./ 
Challan has not been put into the Court and when such report 
shall route to the Court through concerned prosecutor, it shall 
face scrutiny under section 9(5) of the Punjab Criminal 
Prosecution Service (Constitution, Functions and Powers) Act, 
2006, and applicability of wrong penal provision in FIR is also a 
defect to be rectified on the direction of prosecutor as held in 
case reported as “AZIZULLAH KHAN Versus S.H.O. POLICE 
STATION SADDAR, MIANWALI and 4 others” (2013 P Cr. LJ 
1411). A contentious religious issue cannot be brushed aside at 
preliminary stage on the altar of technicalities, particularly when 
the petitioner has given a religious opinion ‘Fatwa’ in black & 
white that could strip up sectarian hatred. Even as per case 
reported as “SHABBAR HASSAIN versus THE STATE” (2011 P 
Cr. L.J 1631), it has been held that before taking cognizance of 
a case any irregularity incurred that does not vitiate the trial, 
may be rectified.   
 
34.   In the light of above discussion following course is open 
in this case; 
1) 
Police has authority even to prepare case cancellation 
report later under Rule 24.7 of Police Rules 1934, if the 
offence ultimately turns out to be a non-cognizable. 
 
2) 
SP investigation can pass direction for preliminary 
investigation in this case pursuant to provisions of section 
196B Cr.P.C., if he opines commission of offence under 
section 295A PPC only. thereafter case shall proceed 
through preliminary investigation which shall follow 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                46 
 
collection of material to facilitate the Federal or Provincial 
Government to lodge complaint for prosecution of offence 
under section 295A PPC before the Court concerned. 
 
3) 
If SP investigation swaps section 295A PPC with any other 
cognizable offence, or add some cognizable offences with 
section 295A PPC, then investigation shall stand 
regularized because in that case by investigating 
cognizable offences police can also investigate non-
cognizable offence without the order of Magistrate. 
Reliance in this respect is placed on case reported as 
“MUHAMMAD JAMIL Versus S.H.O. and others” (1998 P 
Cr. L J 1718). In such situation if the report under section 
173 Cr.P.C. is sent to the Court, accused when summoned 
and if charged under section 295A PPC as well then Court 
can stay the proceedings till the receipt of sanction from 
Provincial Government as per section 230 of Cr.P.C.  
 
4) 
If SP Investigation considers that from the contents of 
allegation an offence under section 8/9 of Anti-terrorism 
Act 1997 is attracted then of course section 295A PPC 
shall also be tried by the Anti-terrorism Court under 
section 17 read with section 21M of said Act, and in such 
situation, bar contained in section 196 shall stand 
neutralized for trial without the complaint of Provincial 
Government as held in case reported as “JAVED IQBAL and 
others Versus The STATE” (2016 SCMR 787).  
 
5) 
If SP investigation declines to pass direction for 
preliminary investigation, then Police can submit report 
under section 173 of Cr.P.C. before the Magistrate who 
can take the cognizance either under clause (a) or (b) of 
sub-section (1) of Section 190 Cr.P.C.  
 
6) 
However, if the matter remained processed through 
preliminary investigation, then accused petitioner can only 
be arrested through a warrant of arrest as mentioned in 

 
 
W.P.No.25543 of 2024                                                                                47 
 
section 155(3) of Cr.P.C., a mode provided in section 
196B of Cr.P.C. as well.  
 
7) 
Otherwise, on summoning by Magistrate on police report 
as cited above, Magistrate can ask the accused to submit 
bail bond under section 91 of Cr.P.C., or he be committed 
to custody under section 351 of Cr.P.C., as held in case 
reported as “MUHAMMAD ASLAM Versus THE STATE and 
others” (2024 P Cr. L J 977).  
 
Thus, no case for quashing of FIR at this preliminary stage of 
the proceedings is made out.   
 
35.   At the end, I gratefully acknowledge the assistance 
provided by Learned Prosecutor General, Mr. Burhan Moazzam, 
Advocate Supreme Court, Mian Tabbasum Ali, Advocate High 
Court, Ms. Nuzhat Bahir, Deputy Prosecutor General & Mr. 
Kamran Adil, DIG Police (all learned amici curiae). The 
additional efforts, put in with provision of relevant material by 
Mr. Bilal Munir, Civil Judge & Mr. Ijaz Ahmad Sapra, Civil 
Judge, both research officers of Lahore High Court, were simply 
matchless. They dug out the material which was not readily 
available. I appreciate their efforts.  
36.  These are also the detailed reason for disposal of connected 
bail petition of the petitioner. With the above observations, this 
writ petition is disposed of.
