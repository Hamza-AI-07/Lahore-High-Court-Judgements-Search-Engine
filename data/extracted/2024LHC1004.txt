      Anwaar Hussain, J.  The present as well as connected petition 
bearing W.P. No.6114 of 2014 are simultaneously being decided 
through this common judgment as vires of sub-rule (3) of Rule 13 of 
the Punjab Local Government (Auctioning of Collection Rights) Rules, 
2003 (“Rules”) have been challenged in both the petitions, whereby, 
the cancellation of the offer of contract awarded is presumed by the 
conduct of the contractor/successful bidder by not depositing the 
required amount of contract within period stipulated in the offer letter 

2 
W.P. No.9661 of 2009 
 
 
on the ground that the said Rule is in violation of Section 142 of the 
Punjab Local Government Ordinance, 2001 (“Ordinance”). In terms of 
sub-rule (3) of Rule 13, the cancellation of contract on account of non-
deposit of a particular amount by the contractor also entails forfeiture 
of the deposits made by the contractor. 
2. 
While the question of law involved in both the petitions is 
identical, the underlying factual landscape in both the petitions vary.  
The present petition relates to the auction of collection rights of 
Rickshaw Fee, whereas, the connected petition is related to the auction 
of collection rights of Advertisement Fee. Similarly, in the present case 
the petitioner was declared as successful bidder who was intimated 
about the outcome of the bid through notice dated 02.06.2008 requiring 
him to deposit certain amount within 03-days. It is the case of the 
petitioner that the notice was received on 04.06.2008 and when the 
petitioner approached the respondent Local Government, on 
07.06.2008, the petitioner was intimated that the three days’ time 
period has elapsed on 05.06.2008 as the notice was issued on 
02.06.2008. Consequently, the earnest/security money to the tune of 
Rs.100,000/- deposited at the time of participation in the auction had 
been forfeited in terms of sub-rule (3) of Rule 13.  
3. 
In the connected matter filed by one Rehmat Ullah, the matter 
relates to collection rights of Advertisement Fee in which the auction 
was held on 29.05.2013 and the petitioner was declared as the highest 
bidder and the petitioner vide letter dated 31.05.2013 was directed to 
deposit certain amount within seven days. It is the case of the petitioner 
in connected matter that he deposited the additional amount demanded, 
however, to the utter surprise of the petitioner, he received another 
notice dated 25.06.2013, whereby, extra amount was demanded and 
when the petitioner objected to the said demand, not only the 
earnest/security amount but also the amount deposited in compliance 
with the letter dated 31.05.2013 was forfeited.

W.P. No.9661 of 2009 
 
 
4. 
Mr. Abdul Rasheed Sheikh, Advocate, learned counsel for the 
petitioners submits that the impugned sub-rule (3) of Rule 13 is penal 
in nature as it offends the parent statute and also impinges upon due 
process right envisaged in terms of Article 10-A of the Constitution of 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 as no separate notice to forfeit 
the earnest/security amount was given and the same is also against the 
injunctions of Islam. Places reliance upon “Province of Sind v. Public 
at Large” (PLD 1988 SC 138) as also “Meenakshinada Deikshtar v. 
Murugesa Nadar and another” [AIR 1970 Madras 391 (V 57C 116)] 
in support of his contentions.  
5. 
Conversely, Mr. Imran Khan, learned Assistant Advocate 
General vehemently refuted the contentions of the petitioners and 
submitted that sub-rule (3) of Rule 13 is not a stand-alone provision 
rather lays down the consequences of the failure of a successful bidder 
to deposit the amount in terms of sub-rule (1) of Rule 13 of the Rules 
whereunder notice dated 02.06.2008 was issued to the petitioner in 
present case as to confirmation of the bid by the auction committee and 
further directed the petitioner to deposit the stated amount failure 
whereof would be visited with the forfeiture of earnest/security 
amount, therefore, the present petitioner was well informed about the 
fact that earnest/security money would be forfeited in terms of the 
Rules if the petitioner fails to deposit the requisite amount and the 
petitioner duly acknowledged the receipt thereof. He further submits 
that the substantial human and financial resources are spent in 
conducting an auction and the forfeiture envisaged under the impugned 
Rule is to ensure that the serious participant(s) turn up in the auction 
and spoilsports are warded off and the earnest/security money is 
forfeited for defraying the cost of auction. As regards the connected 
case, submits that the petitioner therein was well aware of the fact that 
enhancement in the rate of Advertisement Fee was proposed before the 
auction was held and the bidders were well aware that if same is 

4 
W.P. No.9661 of 2009 
 
 
approved by the administrative department, enhanced rate of 
Advertisement Fee will be charged from bidders.  
6. 
In rebuttal, learned counsel for the petitioners submits that even 
if sub-rule (3) of Rule 13 is considered legal and amount deposited as 
earnest/security money can be forfeited, the forfeiture of additional 
deposits is unjust and inequitable and hence, liable to set-aside and the 
respondent Local Government, in connected matter be directed to 
refund the same. 
7. 
Arguments heard and record perused.  
8. 
The Rules have been framed for auctioning of the collection 
rights of various fees and/or taxes of the Local Government. Perusal of 
the Rules reveals that a Local Government under Rule 3 may collect 
income through contractor(s) by awarding contract(s) of collection 
rights. Rule 5 lays down the auction procedure by providing that the 
public notice for the conduct of auction shall be given through two 
national daily newspapers, which shall, inter alia, include the minimum 
reserve price, period of contract with rates and details. Sub-rule (3) of 
Rule 11 empowers the Council to accept or reject the bid by setting out 
the reasons for rejection. Rule 13 provides that as soon as the 
confirmation of  offer of the bid is received from the Council, the same 
shall be intimated through special messenger to the contractor with the 
direction to the contractor to enter into written agreement and fulfil his 
obligations in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract 
within stipulated time and the failure of the contractor to deposit the 
dues recoverable from him and/or does not enter into written agreement 
would raise adverse presumption that the contractor is no more 
interested in the contract. Sub-rule (3) of Rule 13 further states that in 
such an eventuality, the offer shall automatically stand cancelled and 
the deposits made by the contractor shall stand forfeited. The income 

5 
W.P. No.9661 of 2009 
 
 
shall also be put to re-auction. At this juncture, it would be convenient 
to reproduce the Rule 13 of the Rules which reads as under: 
“13.Intimation of acceptance of bid:-(1) As soon 
as the confirmation from the Council about the 
acceptance of bid or offer is received, the Local 
Government administration shall communicate the 
acceptance of bid or offer to the contractor 
immediately by a letter though special messenger at 
his address provided by him at the time of 
participation in auction and direct him to enter into 
written agreement and fulfill his obligations in 
accordance with the terms and conditions of contact. 
 (2) The cost of written agreement shall be borne by 
the contractor.  
(3) In case the contractor does not turn up to deposit 
dues recoverable from him in the light of terms and 
conditions of auction or does not enter into written 
agreement within the specified period mentioned in 
the communication, it shall be presumed that the 
contractor is no more interested in the contract. As 
such the 
contract shall automatically stand 
cancelled and the deposits made by the contractor 
shall stand forfeited. The income shall also be put to 
re-auction in such a case.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
The Rules provide for the manner and mechanism for the auction of 
collection rights of fee/tax/income of the Local Government through 
private contractors. The process of the auction goggles up substantial 
human and financial resources of the Local Government in carrying out 
the auction. The deposit of earnest/security money in order to 
participate in the public auction, purposively speaking, ensures that 
serious contenders participate in the process of auction. However, if a 
contractor participates in the auction process and subsequently retracts 
from it after confirmation of the bid by the Council, it would constrain 
the Local Government to re-auction involving not only the time and 
resources of the Local Government but also loss of time and finance in 
the collection of fees. Therefore, the forfeiture of earnest/security 

6 
W.P. No.9661 of 2009 
 
 
money of such a contractor ensures that serious contender(s) 
participates in the process of auction and if someone fails to deposit the 
outstanding/balance amount of the bid, the earnest/security amount 
stands forfeited in favour of the Local Government. Therefore, there 
appears to be no illegality in the impugned sub-rule (3) of the Rule 13.  
9. 
The law does not envisage that a separate notice of consequence 
of failure to deposit the amount is required to be given. The only thing 
that is required to be ascertained is whether the notice was given and 
received by the successful bidder and within time stipulated therein the 
requisite amount was not deposited. In present petition, it is noted that 
the process of the advertisement was triggered by the newspaper 
publication on 22.04.2008 and was confirmed by the Council on 
31.05.2008 which was subsequently intimated to the petitioner in 
present case vide notice dated 02.06.2008. The collection was to 
commence form 01.07.2008 and was to continue till 30.6.2009 under 
the contract. As far as non-service of notice is concerned, the same is 
misconceived for two-fold reasons. Firstly, under Rule 7 of the Rules, 
the terms and conditions of the contract are to be supplied by the Local 
Government at the time of participation in the bid. The terms and 
conditions of the tender documents clearly puts the contenders on 
notice that failure to deposit the balance amount within the stipulated 
time after the confirmation of bid shall result in forfeiture of the 
earnest/security money. Similarly, the petitioner was served notice in 
terms of sub-rule (1) of Rule 13, which clearly stipulates that failure to 
deposit the balance amount within 03-days would result in forfeiture of 
the earnest/security money. This shows that the petitioner was not only 
aware of the forfeiture of earnest/security money envisaged under the 
terms and conditions supplied at the time of carrying out the auction 
but was also served notice subsequent to the confirmation of the bid by 
the Council which clearly stated that failure to deposit the balance 
amount within three days would result in forfeiture. The receipt of the 

7 
W.P. No.9661 of 2009 
 
 
notice is admitted on both hands. Thus, the stance of the petitioner that 
forfeiture under sub-rule (3) of Rule 13 is ultra vires on account of 
non-provision of opportunity of hearing is also against the facts. Not 
only the notice in terms of sub-rule (1) of Rule 13 provides for service 
of notice as to confirmation of the bid and deposit of balance amount 
but the same was also served. Sub-rule (3) of Rule 13 merely provides 
the consequences of non-adherence to the terms and conditions of the 
bid. Perusal of the notice makes it obvious that even the consequences 
envisaged under sub-rule (3) of Rule 13 were provided in the notice 
served upon the petitioner. It would be convenient to reproduce the 
notice served upon the petitioner, which reads as under:

The other contention raised by learned counsel for the petitioner 
in respect of present case is that service of the notice dated 02.06.2008 
was effected on 04.06.2008 and the three days’ time period stipulated 
in the notice was to lapse on 07.06.2008 and when the petitioner 
approached the respondents on the said date, he was intimated that his 
earnest/security money has been forfeited as time lapsed on 
05.06.2008. Perusal of copy of notice reveals that it is dated 02.06.2008 
and the petitioner has affixed his signature on the bottom of the same 
where no date of receipt has been mentioned. Therefore, in the absence 
of any date of receipt, the date of issuance of the notice will be 
presumed to be its date of receipt as the same was to be communicated 
immediately through special messenger in terms of sub-rule (1) of Rule 
13. When confronted, there was no explanation available with the 
petitioner side. Even otherwise, it is settled law that this Court, in 
exercise of its constitutional jurisdiction, cannot venture into such 
factual controversy which requires recording of evidence. It is worth 
observing that Section 74 of the Contract Act, 1872 also provides that 
where the liquidated damages are settled in the contract, the party 
aggrieved of the breach of contract is not bound to prove the same. The 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in case reported as “Space Telecom 
(Private) Limited, Lahore v. Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, 
Islamabad through Chairman”(2019 SCMR 101) involving identical 
question of law upheld the forfeiture of the earnest/security money on 
account of failure of the petitioner consortium to deposit the 
subsequent amount within stipulated period of ten days.  
11. 
As regards the connected petition, it is noted that the petitioner 
therein deposited the earnest/security money and turned out to be 
successful bidder which was confirmed by the Local Government 
concerned whereupon the petitioner further deposited the balance 
amount of Rs.1,443,547/-. However, the controversy revolves around 
the increase in the Advertisement Fee by the Local Government during 

9 
W.P. No.9661 of 2009 
 
 
the process of auction. Therefore, the petitioner was asked to further 
deposit the increase made in the reserve price by the respondent Local 
Government concerned, during the auction process, which he refused 
to do. Consequently, not only the earnest/security money but the 
further deposit of balance amount in pursuance of notice under sub-rule 
(1) of Rule 13 was also forfeited. It is noted that the 
advertisement/public notice for auction included a clause that the 
proposals for the increase in Advertisement Fee has been forwarded by 
the Local Government concerned to the Secretary Local Government 
and Community Development, Government of Punjab, which were to 
be made applicable to the disputed auction proceedings when approved 
and notified in the Official Gazette. The same clause was also 
incorporated in the terms and conditions delivered to the participants at 
the time of auction including the petitioner in connected petition. 
Subsequently, the said enhancement was approved and notified by the 
Secretary 
Local 
Government 
and 
Community 
Development 
Department. As observed above, the earnest/security money under the 
Rules is received as a measure to ensure that serious contenders 
participate in the auction and if successful bidder fails to enter the 
contract and deposit of the balance amount in accordance with the 
terms and conditions, the earnest/security money stands forfeited. The 
object of such forfeiture has been spelled out in sub-rule (3) of the 
Rules by the legislature by contemplating that “The income shall also 
be put to re-auction in such a case”. No doubt the petitioner in 
connected matter was fully aware of the likelihood of subsequent 
enhancement in the Advertisement Fee and participated in the auction 
of his own volition, however, bare reading of Rule 13 makes it clear 
that the legislature has made a correlation between the earnest/security 
money and the object of forfeiture, which is to meet the cost of re-
auction on account of failure of the successful bidder to deposit the 
balance amount and/or non-adherence to terms and conditions. Once 
the first deposit was made, the contract came into existence between 

10 
W.P. No.9661 of 2009 
 
 
the parties and the forfeiture of additional deposit was to be regulated 
by the provisions of said contract executed between the parties and not 
the terms of the auction. Though the term “deposits” has been used to 
be forfeited in terms of sub-rule (3) of Rule 13, it is settled principle of 
interpretation that the words have no constant meanings rather they 
imbibe colour from their context. Therefore, the term “deposits” is 
required to be construed in the context in which it has been used in 
Rule 13, which deals with the intimation of acceptance of the bid 
requiring the contractor/successful bidder to enter into formal contract. 
The forfeiture of deposits envisaged in sub-rule (3) of Rule 13 relates 
to pre-contracts stage as the relations between the respondent and the 
petitioner were to be regulated by the terms and conditions of the 
auction whereas the relations between the parties transform into 
contractual relations subsequent to the execution of the contract. 
Therefore, while the forfeiture of the earnest/security amount deposited 
prior to holding of auction is justifiable in terms of sub-rule (3) of Rule 
13, however, any contractual violation subsequent to the execution of 
the contract is to be resolved as per the mechanism provided under the 
contract (including arbitration clause) and not by the terms of the 
auction. Even otherwise, the rate of Advertisement Fee, which was 
likely to be enhanced after approval was uncertain as nothing has been 
brought on record that any specific amount was clearly made known to 
the petitioner of connected matter and similarly placed person. An 
uncertain term of the contract cannot be enforced under the law. 
Therefore, this Court is of the opinion that the forfeiture of only 
earnest/security amount is envisaged by the law and forfeiture in 
connected petition of additional amount is unjustified as the same is 
beyond the scope of the liquidated damages envisaged under the terms 
and conditions of the auction and is also harsh and arbitrary, hence, not 
justified.       

11 
W.P. No.9661 of 2009 
 
 
12. 
In view of the above discussion, this Court is of the opinion that 
sub-rule (3) of Rule 13 is not ultra vires the Ordinance. The present 
petition is devoid of merits and hence, dismissed. The connected 
constitutional petition bearing W.P No.6114/2014 has force to the 
extent that forfeiture of additional amount deposited in terms of letter 
dated 31.05.2013 was arbitrary and is hereby declared illegal. The 
respondent Local Government concerned in connected petition i.e., 
W.P. No.6114/2014 is obligated to return the said additional amount to 
the petitioner of the connected petition, namely, Rehmat Ullah, within 
a period of 30-days from receipt of certified copy of this judgment. The 
connected W.P. No.6114/2014 is disposed of in the said terms.
