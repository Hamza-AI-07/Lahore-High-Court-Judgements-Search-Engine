Through 
this 
constitutional petition filed under Article 199 of the Constitution of 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, petitioners have called into 
question the legality and validity of judgments/orders dated 
08.10.2015 and 17.12.2015 passed by the Courts below whereby 
their application under Section 12(2) C.P.C., 1908 was dismissed for 
want of evidence.  
2. 
Relevant facts forming background of this petition are that 
respondents No.3 to 7 instituted a suit for specific performance of an 
agreement to sell dated 21.01.1997 on 06.05.2002 against 
predecessor of the petitioners namely Bashir Ahmad, Muhammad 
Siddique Khan and Province of the Punjab. Suit was resisted by the 
predecessor of the petitioners by filing contesting written statement, 
however, defendant No.2 Muhammad Siddique Khan filed 
consenting written statement, whereas, Province of the Punjab also 
filed contesting written statement. During the pendency of said suit, 

W.P. No. 7718 of 2017. 
2
on 10.02.2009, it was apprised to the Court that compromise has 
been effected between the parties, hence, learned Trial Court 
adjourned the proceedings for 11.02.2009 and on the said date 
compromising statements of the parties were recorded, compromise 
deed was brought on record as Exh.C.1 and ownership document of 
Bashir Ahmad was also brought on record as Exh.P.1. Thereafter, 
learned Trial Court decreed the suit on the basis of compromise vide 
judgment & decree dated 23.07.2009.  
3. 
Predecessor of the petitioners namely Bashir Ahmad 
(defendant No.1) filed an application under Section 12(2) C.P.C. on 
11.07.2012 and challenged the said compromise decree on the 
ground of fraud and mis-representation. During the pendency of said 
application, said Bashir Ahmad expired and petitioners being his 
legal heirs were brought on record. Respondents No.3 to 7 filed 
contesting written reply of the application. Learned Trial Court 
keeping in view divergent stances of the parties framed necessary 
issues on 10.07.2014 and invited the petitioners to produce evidence 
in support of their contentions but despite availing numerous 
opportunities they failed to produce evidence, therefore, learned 
Trial Court vide order dated 08.10.2015 struck off their right of 
evidence and dismissed the application for want of evidence. Feeling 
aggrieved, petitioners filed a revision petition which was dismissed 
by the learned revisional Court vide judgment/order dated 
07.12.2015. Petitioners assailed said orders of Courts below through 
instant Constitutional Petition.  
4. 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and 
perused the record with their able assistance.  
5. 
Perusal of record reflects that the learned Trial Court framed 
the issues on the application of the petitioners on 10.07.2014 and 
directed the petitioners to produce their evidence. Petitioners were 
granted 15 adjournments for production of evidence. On three 
occasions, learned Presiding Officer was not available and on three 
occasions lawyers were observing strike. Evidence of the petitioners 
was not available on the said 15 dates and specifically on nine dates 

W.P. No. 7718 of 2017. 
3
of hearing when Presiding Officer was available and lawyers were 
also not observing strike and the case was adjourned on the 
petitioners’ request due to non-availability of their evidence. On the 
preceding date i.e. 03.10.2015 final opportunity with warning was 
granted to the petitioners. For reference, said order dated 03.10.2015 
is reproduced in verbatim as under: 
03.10.15."

Despite this clear-cut warning petitioners did not bother to 
produce their evidence.   
6. 
Perusal of record reveals that the learned trial Court granted 
sufficient opportunities before invoking the penal provisions of 
Order XVII Rule 3 of the C.P.C. In these circumstances, learned trial 
Court was having the jurisdiction not only under Order XVII, Rule 3 
of the C.P.C. but also was having further powers with it in 
accordance with the Lahore High Court Amendment of Order XVII, 
Rule 1(3) of the C.P.C., which for ready reference reads as under:-  
“Where sufficient cause is not shown for the grant of an 
adjournment under sub-rule (1) the Court shall proceed with the 
suit forthwith.”  
 
 
It is clear from the wording of the said Rule that on the failure of 
a party to produce its evidence or to do any other act necessary for the 
purpose of the case, for which time had been allowed to him, the Court 
shall proceed to decide the suit forthwith.  
7. 
It is evident from the record that on the preceding dates, the 
adjournments were granted on the request of learned counsel for the 
petitioners with a particular direction specifying an act to be done on 
the next date of hearing, therefore, the petitioners were bound to do the 
said act and definitely default in doing so will attract the provisions of 
Order XVII Rule 3 C.P.C. This Rule applies to a case where time has 
been granted to a party at his instance, to produce evidence or to cause 

W.P. No. 7718 of 2017. 
4
the attendance of witnesses or to perform any other act necessary for 
the progress of the suit and will not apply unless default has been 
committed by such party in doing the act for which the time was 
granted. Guidance is sought from the case law titled “Maulvi Abdul 
Aziz Khan v. Mst. Jahan Begum and 2 others” (PLD 1971 SC 434). 
Same moot point was also observed in case titled “Shahid Hussain v. 
Lahore Municipal Corporation” (PLD 1981 S C 474) as well as in 
case titled “Executive Engineer, Peshawar v. Messrs Tour Muhammad 
and sons and 4 others” (1983 SCMR 619) wherein it was held as 
under: - 
“This Rule applied where a party who is granted time to perform 
some act, not only fails to do so but is also absent on the date of 
which the hearing is adjourned. It is immaterial whether the 
adjournment was granted at the instance of the party or for other 
reasons. Where a defendant does not appear at an adjourned 
hearing, this rules applied irrespective of whether he appeared at 
the First hearing or not and the Court has to exercise its discretion; 
its hands are not tied by the previous ex-parte order.” 
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case titled “Syed 
Tahir Hussain Mehmoodi and others v. Agha Syed Liaqat Ali and 
others” (2014 SCMR 637), elaborated and guided the situation where 
the party was present on the day when the penal provision was invoked, 
wherein it was held as under: - 
“In the above context, it may be held that in every case where the 
action against a delinquent party is imperative and his evidence 
has to be closed because the case squarely and eminently falls 
within the mischief of Order XVII, Rule 3  C.P.C., the Court while 
closing the evidence is not in any manner obliged to adjourn the 
case and require or ask the litigant to appear and examine himself 
as a witness on a subsequent date. Obviously if the party is present 
in the Court and desires to appear as a witness the Court should 
not decline his request, rather it shall be appropriate that where 
the party is present, the Court should not decline his request, 
rather it shall be appropriate that where the party is present, the 
Court while applying Order XVII Rule 3 C.P.C. and closing the 
evidence on a given date should itself ask the party to avail the 
chance of appearing as his own witness, and should also record 
such fact in its order (order sheet) that a chance was given to the 
litigant which has not been availed. However, if this fact is not so 
recorded by the Court though the party was present and sought its 
examination such party should initially move an application to the 
Court for examination if the case has not yet been decided. But 
where the case is finally decided a ground should be specifically 
set in the memo of appeal/revision as the case may be about the 
presence of the party and asking for the examination, which should 
be supported by an affidavit of the counsel of the said party to the 
above effect.”

8. 
The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in a reported case titled 
“Rana TANVEER KHAN versus NASEER-UD-DIN and others” 
(2015 SCMR 1401), observed as under:- 
“Be that as it may, once the case is fixed by the Court for recording 
the evidence of the party, it is the direction of the court to do the 
needful, and the party has the obligation to adduce evidence 
without there being any fresh direction by the court, however, 
where the party makes a request for adjourning the matter to a 
further date(s), the provisions of Order XVII, Rule 3, C.P.C. can 
attract, 
especially 
in 
the 
circumstances 
when 
adequate 
opportunities on the request of the party has been availed and 
caution is also issued on one of such a date(s), as being the last 
opportunity(ies).” 
 
It was further held in the said case that: - 
“In the present case, as mentioned above, it is clear from the 
record that the appellant had availed four opportunities to produce 
his evidence and in two of such orders (the last in the chain) he 
was cautioned that such opportunity granted to him at his request 
shall be the last one, but still on the day when his evidence was 
closed in terms of Order XVII Rule 3, C.P.C. no reasonable ground 
was propounded for the purposes of failure to adduce the evidence 
and justification for further opportunity, therefore, notwithstanding 
that these opportunities granted to the appellant were only in a 
span of about 1 month and 26 days, yet his case squarely fell within 
the mischief of the provisions ibid and his evidence was rightly 
closed by the trial Court.” 
 
The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan dealing with the same 
preposition of law in a case reported as “MOON ENTERPRISER CNG 
STATION, 
RAWALPINDI 
versus 
SUI 
NORTHERN 
GAS 
PIPELINES LIMITED through General Manager, Rawalpindi and 
another” (2020 SCMR 300) also observed as under:- 
“A bare reading of Order XVII, Rule 3, C.P.C. and case law cited 
above clearly shows that for Order XVII, Rule 3, C.P.C. to apply 
and the right of a party to produce evidence to be closed, the 
following conditions must have been met: 
 
i. 
at the request of a party to the suit for the purpose of 
adducing evidence, time must have been granted with a 
specific warning that said opportunity will be the last and 
failure to adduce evidence would lead to closure of the 
right to produce evidence; and  
 
ii. 
the same party on the date which was fixed as last 
opportunity fails to produce its evidence.”  
 
It was further held in the said case as under: - 

W.P. No. 7718 of 2017. 
6
“In our view it is important for the purpose of maintaining the 
confidence of the litigants in the Court systems and the 
presiding officers that where last opportunity to produce 
evidence is granted and the party has been warned of the 
consequences, the Court must enforce its order unfailingly 
and unscrupulously without exception. Such order would in 
our opinion not only put the system back on track and 
reaffirm the majesty of the law but also put a check on the 
trend of seeking multiple adjournments on frivolous grounds 
to prolong and delay proceedings without any valid or 
legitimate rhyme or reason. Where the Court has passed an 
order granting the last opportunity, it has not only passed a 
judicial order but also made a promise to the parties to the lis 
that no further adjournments will be granted for any reason. 
The Court must enforce its order and honour its promise. 
There is absolutely no room or choice to do anything else. The 
order to close the right to produce evidence must 
automatically follow failure to produce evidence despite last 
opportunity coupled with a warning. The trend of granting 
(Akhri Mouqa) then (Qatai Akhri Mouqa) and then (Qati 
Qatai Akhri Mouqa) make a mockery of the provisions of law 
and those responsible to interpret and implement it. Such 
practices must be discontinued, forthwith.” 
 
 
9. 
In the present case the necessary conditions for order XVII Rule 3 
C.P.C. to apply were fully met and the learned Courts below correctly 
used its power to close the right of the petitioners to produce evidence. 
The petitioners availed almost 15 dates for the production of their 
evidence including final opportunity and with categorical warning that 
in case of non-availability of evidence, their right to produce evidence 
will be closed, which meant that the petitioners were put to notice that if 
they failed to adduce evidence, action shall be taken against them, but 
they failed to produce the same and no reasonable ground was 
propounded for the purpose of failure to adduce the evidence and 
justification for further opportunity. There is no hard and fast rule that 
after how many dates the right to produce evidence will be closed. It 
may not be out of place to mention here that to apply and to adhere to 
law is not a mere technicality rather it is duty cast upon the Court as per 
Article 4 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 to do 
so. Thus where Order XVII Rule 3 C.P.C. is duly attracted, the Court 
has no option except to take action in accord therewith.  
10. 
In these circumstance, I am unable to disagree with the findings 
recorded by both the courts below as learned counsel for the petitioners 

W.P. No. 7718 of 2017. 
7
has not been able to demonstrate any infirmity, error or flaw in the 
impugned orders or any illegality, irregularity or jurisdictional defect in 
the findings recorded by learned courts below that may have furnished 
any justification or basis for interference in the impugned orders.  
11. 
I have also observed that petitioners filed the instant Writ 
Petition against orders dated 08.10.2015 and 17.12.2015 on 
23.07.2017 which is also hit by principal of laches as the petitioners 
failed to approach this Court within reasonable time of 90-days as 
explained by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in case titled 
“PAKISTAN INTERNATIONAL AIRLINE CORPORATION and 
others versus TANWEER-UR-REHMAN and others” (PLD 2010 
Supreme Court 676), wherein it was held as under:- 
“But as far as the rule laid down in these judgments is concerned, 
it would not be applicable to an ordinary person filing petition 
by invoking jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 199 of 
the Constitution and he has to approach the Court within the 
reasonable time. Although no definition of the expression 
„reasonable time‟ is available in any instrument of law, however, 
the Courts have interpreted it to be 90 days.” 
  
12. 
The conduct of the petitioners is not up to the mark and they 
are not serious in conducting their case vigilantly. Further it has also 
been settled by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan that if the 
person invoking the constitutional jurisdiction of High Court is 
guilty of lethargy, inaction, laxity or gross negligence in suing the 
case for enforcement of right, it would be justified in non-suiting 
such person on the principle of laches. In this view of the matter, 
petitioners are not entitled to any leniency.  
13. 
For the foregoing reasons, this petition merits rejection on 
merits as well as on the principle of laches, hence, the same is 
dismissed.
