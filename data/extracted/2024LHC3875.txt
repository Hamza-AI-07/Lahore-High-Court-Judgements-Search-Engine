3. 
The Utility Stores Corporation (‘USC’) is a state 
owned enterprise established in the year 1971 to 
provide basic commodities to the general public at 
prices lower than the open market.  However, on 
14.06.2024 through a notification issued by the Cabinet 
Division, Government of Pakistan (impugned herein) a 
High-Powered Committee comprising nine members 
including the Chairman was constituted for a detailed 
review and analysis on the basis of initial work done by 
the earlier committee for reducing the size of the 
Federal Government.  On 07.08.2024 an office 
memorandum (impugned herein) was issued by the 
Finance Division to the Secretary, Ministry of 
Industries and Production to share restructuring/ 
transformation plans of the entities which were declared 
as strategic or essential.  Thereafter, the Prime Minister 
of Pakistan in the meeting of rightsizing of the Federal 
Government on 16.08.2024 passed a direction that the 
USC should be wound up and an alternate arrangement 
should be explored which might include cash transfer to 
the recipients.  Hence, these petitions.

                                     W.P.No.50232 of 2024 & 
                                 W.P.No.51306 of 2024 
4. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that 
the USC being a state owned entity registered under 
prevailing laws of Pakistan has its own vigilance 
system to snub any sort of pilferage or malpractice and 
is self-sustaining organization which has never taken a 
single penny from the Government to run its business 
including disbursement of salaries to staff rather it 
generates revenue for the Government so no question 
for winding up this profitable entity arises.  He 
maintains that subsidy allowed by the Government is 
passed on to the general public by the USC in a 
systematic and transparent manner.  According to him, 
procedure for winding up of a state owned enterprise 
has been provided in section 293 of the Companies Act, 
2017 which has not been adopted properly.  He further 
contends that as many as 12000 employees have been 
working in USC, half of which are either on daily 
wages or contract basis who cannot be absorbed in any 
other department/organization.  He adds that the 
Rightsizing Committee earlier decided to privatize the 
USC but now contrary to that has illegally decided to 
wind it up without adopting any legal course.  
According to him the Board of Directors of the USC 
has also passed a resolution by virtue of which the USC 
has been declared a profitable and essential state owned 
enterprise.  He further adds that if the Government does 
not provide food subsidy the USC will run its operation 
on commercial model after restructuring.  
5. 
The USC has filed report and parawise comments 
wherein contention of the petitioner has been supported.  
6. 
Conversely, learned Law Officer appearing on 
behalf of the Federation of Pakistan contends that no 
adverse order has been passed against the employees of 

4 
                                     W.P.No.50232 of 2024 & 
                                 W.P.No.51306 of 2024 
the USC, therefore, this petition is pre-mature.  He 
further contends that decision of the Government to 
wind up the USC is a policy matter which cannot be 
assailed as the Courts in exercise of jurisdiction under 
Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973(‘Constitution’) have refrained from 
interfering in this domain.  He adds that the matter in 
question entails factual inquiry which exercise cannot 
be undertaken in constitutional petition. 
7. 
Arguments of both the sides have been heard.     
8. 
Earlier, the low-income people were being 
provided basic commodities through the USC and now 
the Government, as per minutes of meeting of 
Committee on rightsizing of the Federal Government 
attached with the petitions, has decided to explore 
alternate arrangement, which is a matter of policy 
involving complicated economic factors.   
9. 
The scope of judicial review of Government’s 
policy is now well-settled.  The Courts cannot assume 
the role of Appellate Authority to examine the 
rightness, suitability and appositeness of a policy.  The 
scope of judicial review while examining a policy of the 
Government is to see whether it encroaches upon 
fundamental rights of the citizens or violates any 
provision of the Constitution or any statute.   
10. The Courts cannot interfere with the policy either 
on the ground that it is erroneous or that a better, fairer 
or wiser alternative is available.  The duty of the Court 
is to confine itself to the question of legality and its 
concern should be whether a decision making authority 
exceeded its powers or committed an error of law.  The 
policies of the Government may not remain stagnant, 
rather with the change in economic climate, the wisdom 

5 
                                     W.P.No.50232 of 2024 & 
                                 W.P.No.51306 of 2024 
and the manner for the Government to run commercial 
projects may require reconsideration.  A policy might 
have been in the public interest at a point of time, 
however, the same cannot be considered so at some 
other point of time.  Therefore, any decision of the 
Government that it cannot run the Corporation 
departmentally or any other form is not justiciable.  
Indeed Parliament is the forum for debates on questions 
involving political economy and not the Court.  In 
support of above propositions, reliance is placed on the 
cases of Dr. Akhtar Hussain Khan and others vs. 
Federation of Pakistan and others (2012 SCMR 455), 
Watan Party through President vs. Federation of 
Pakistan through Cabinet Committee of Privatization, 
Islamabad and others (PLD 2006 Supreme Court 
697), Directorate of Film Festivals & Ors. vs. Gaurav 
Ashwin Jain & Ors. (AIR 2007 Supreme Court 1640) 
and BALCO Employees Union (Regd.) vs. Union of 
India and others (AIR 2002 Supreme Court 350).   
11. The petitioner has not been able to make out a 
case that decision of the Government to wind up USC is 
illegal or opposed to the Constitution.  Although the 
Government’s decision may have an impact on the 
employees’ rights in future upon implementation of the 
policy decision, who may avail the remedies in 
accordance with law for violation of their legal rights, if 
any, before the concerned forum.  As far as this case is 
concerned, since no adverse action has so far been 
taken against employees of the USC, no writ can be 
issued against the Government to prevent its policy 
decision.  It is well-settled that a writ lies when some 
legal right of any party is infringed which clearly is not 
the case here.  Reliance in this regard is placed on the 

6 
                                     W.P.No.50232 of 2024 & 
                                 W.P.No.51306 of 2024 
cases of Mian Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif vs. 
Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of 
Interior, Government of Pakistan, Islamabad and 
others (PLD 2004 Supreme Court 583) and Union of 
India & Anr. vs. Kunisetty Satyanarayana (AIR 2007 
Supreme Court 906).  Needless to mention here that 
for access to the information the petitioner may exhaust 
remedies under the Right of Access to Information Act, 
2017. 
12. In view of the foregoing reasons, both the 
petitions filed by the petitioner are dismissed for being 
devoid of any merit.
