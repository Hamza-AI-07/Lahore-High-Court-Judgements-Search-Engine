   JUDGMENT 
 
 
 
RAHEEL KAMRAN, J:- This judgment shall deal 
with ten petitions brought under Article 199 of the Constitution of 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (‘the Constitution’) i.e. 
W.P.No.126306 of 2017, W.P.No.7911 of 2017, W.P.No.98903 of 
2017, W.P.No.119360 of 2017, W.P.No.159598 of 2018, 
W.P.No.1594 of 2019, W.P.No.61038 of 2019, W.P.No.1807 of 
2021, W.P.No.308 of 2022 and W.P.No.8768 of 2023, as these 
involve similar questions in controversy. 
 

W. P. No.126306 of 2017

2. 
Primarily, the following two questions are under 
consideration for decision in these petitions: - 
 
1. 
Whether a decree for maintenance granted for an amount less 
than Rs.5000/- per month to each of the plaintiffs is 
appealable under section 14(2)(c) of the Family Courts Act, 
1964 by the judgment debtor if the aggregate amount of the 
decree is more than Rs.5000/- per month? 
 
2. 
Whether Clauses (b) and (c) of Subsection (2) of Section 14 of 
the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 are not ultra vires 
to the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 after 
insertion of Article 10-A in the Constitution?  
  
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners contend that 
legislative intent for enactment of provisions of clauses (b) & (c) of 
subsection (2) of section 14 of the Family Courts Act, 1964 (‘the 
Act’) was to curtail the right of appeal for meager amount of 
Rs.5000/- in aggregate.  According to them, such curtailment is 
flooding this Court with challenges.  The wisdom that at least one 
appeal must be provided is jurisprudentially well recognized in law.  
If there are more than one children and the decree, even if for less 
than Rs.5000/- per child may adversely affect for being beyond 
financial resources of the defendant without judicial scrutiny in 
appeal.  They finally contend that such interpretation has to be 
adopted as would advance the remedy of appeal. Reliance in this 
regard has been placed on the case of Abdul Rahim and 2 others vs. 
Messrs United Bank Ltd. of Pakistan (PLD 1997 Karachi 62). 
4. 
Mr. Muhammad Shahzad Shaukat ASC, learned 
Amicus Curiae, contends that the ouster of appeal under section 14 
of the Act is not against any party to the proceedings but a decree 
which is indivisible.  He maintains that if a decree is cumulatively 
for an amount Rs.5000/- or less per month, the right of appeal under 
clause (c) of section 14(2) of the Act is curtailed.  He adds that 
judgment in the case of “Sarfraz vs. Additional District Judge and 5 
others (2017 YLR 1684) is not supported by the text of section 
14(2)(c) of the Act.  He emphasizes that at least one right of appeal 

W. P. No.126306 of 2017 
3 
 
against a judgment and decree of the Family Court is a vested right 
and ouster of such right under section 14(2)(c) ibid renders the 
provision repugnant to injunctions of Islam and abridges the 
fundamental right to fair trial as enshrined in Article 10A of the 
Constitution.  In support of his contentions, reliance has been placed 
on the cases of Messrs Chenab Cement product (Pvt.) Ltd. and 
others vs. Banking Tribunal, Lahore and others (PLD 1996 Lahore 
672), Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Defence vs. the 
General Public (PLD 1989 SC 6) and Ali Azhar Khan Baloch and 
others vs. Province of Sindh and others (2015 SCMR 456).   
5. 
Mr. Shan Gull, learned Advocate General, Punjab, 
while endorsing arguments of Mr. Muhammad Shahzad Shaukat, 
Advocate Supreme Court maintains that the ouster of appeal 
visualized under section 14(2)(c) of the Act is in relation to a decree 
for maintenance of Rs.5000/- or less per month and not in relation 
to maintenance per person.  He adds that being an ouster clause, the 
same has to be construed strictly.   He further contends that Article 
3 of the Constitution mandates elimination of exploitation and 
section 14(2)(c) ibid does not deprive a poor of his right of appeal.  
He finally contends that the fundamental right to a fair trial was 
added to the Constitution after insertion of clause (c) in section 
14(2) of the Act and such post-amendment clause has to be 
construed keeping in view the doctrine of eclipse.  Reliance in this 
regard has been placed on the cases of Bhikaji Narain Dhakras and 
others vs. State of Madhya Pradesh and another (A.I.R. 1955 SC 
781), Thomas Dana vs. State of Punjab (A.I.R 1959 SC 387) and 
Saiyyid Abula’la Maudoodi and 2 others vs. The Government of 
West Pakistan and another (PLD 1964 SC 673).   
6. 
Mr. Zafar Iqbal Kalanori ASC, learned Amicus Curiae, 
has taken the position on question No.1 that the amount of 
Rs.5000/- or less specified in clause (c) of section 14(2) of the Act, 
for the purpose of exclusion of right of appeal, is cumulative.  In 

W. P. No.126306 of 2017 
4 
 
support of such plea, he has placed reliance on the case of 
Muhammad Latif Kashif vs. Judge Family Court/Civil Judge, 1st 
Class, Bahawalpur and 3 others (PLD 2005 Lahore 296).  
According to him, the right of at least one appeal is a universally 
recognized principle, be it inquisitorial jurisdiction or adversarial 
jurisdiction.  He emphasizes that the object of an appeal is to 
provide a possibility for correction of an error in appeal arising from 
a judgment and decree determining right and civil liability by the 
Family Court.  He adds that the remedy under Article 199 of the 
Constitution is not an alternate of appeal for such remedy is a matter 
of discretion of the Court.  He finally contends that the right to fair 
trial includes one right of appeal and clause (c) of section 14(2) of 
the Act, in so far as it takes away the right of appeal, is void being 
in violation of Article 10A of the Constitution and the same is 
discriminatory inasmuch as the Appellate Court shall legitimately 
consider if any interim relief against the decree is available against 
women and children and on what terms?    
7. 
Mr. Khalid Ishaq ASC, learned Amicus Curiae, 
contends that one right of appeal is not, of necessity, part of the 
right to fair trial enshrined in Article 10A of the Constitution.  He 
emphasizes the distinction between a right of appeal being curtailed 
or prohibited and the right of appeal being regulated.  Further 
contends that no mala fide could be attributed to the legislature, 
however, the bona fides of the legislature as also the purpose and 
object of a statute may be considered in determination of the vires 
of a statute.  As regards interpretation of section 14(2)(c) of the Act, 
he contends that purposive rather than a literal approach to the 
interpretation is to be adopted while construing the said provision 
and only such construction was permissible as would advance the 
purpose of the provision enacted rather than interpretation which 
would defeat its objects.  Being a beneficial provision in the Act, he 
adds, the same must be interpreted liberally in a manner so that the 

W. P. No.126306 of 2017 
5 
 
benefit conferred was advanced rather than frustrated or subverted.  
He finally contends that Article 25(3) of the Constitution 
unequivocally allowed for special provisions to be made for the 
benefit of women and children as an exception to the general rule of 
equal treatment and the said article clearly allowed positive 
discrimination in favour of women and children, therefore, section 
14(2)(c) of the Act is a valid piece of legislation enacted for the 
benefit of women and children to regulate the right of appeal against 
meager amount of maintenance decreed per month in their favour.  
He places reliance on the case of Shaukat Ali vs. Election 
Commission of Pakistan through Secretary, Islamabad and others 
(2018 SCMR 2086), Messrs Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd. and 
others vs. Federation of Pakistan and others (2018 SCMR 802) and 
Saif-Ur-Rehman vs. Additional District Judge, Toba Tek Singh and 
2 others (2018 SCMR 1885).  Finally, he poses a question as to 
whether 10% annual increase under section 17A(3) of the Act 
would render the decree appealable? 
8. 
Arguments heard.   Record perused. 
9. 
To 
answer 
the 
first 
question 
posed 
for 
our 
consideration, as stated in paragraph No.2 herein above, it would be 
advantageous to reproduce the section 14(2)(c) of the Act, which 
reads as follows: - 
“S. 14. Appeal.- (1) ……. 
 
 
(2) No appeal shall lie from a decree by a Family Court- 
 
(a) …….. 
 
(b) …….. 
 
(c) for maintenance of rupees (Five thousand) or less per  
      month.” 
 
Rules governing interpretation of section 14(2) of the Act   
10. 
Purposive approach is the rule for interpretation of 
section 14(2) of the Act, which has been enunciated by the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in the case of Saif-Ur-Rehman vs. Additional 
District Judge, Toba Tek Singh and 2 others (2018 SCMR 1885) in 
the following way: - 

W. P. No.126306 of 2017 
6 
 
10. Before proceeding further, it may be appropriate to 
contextualize the Family Courts Act, 1964 in general and section 
14(2), in particular. Out of the general canvass of the forum and 
procedure for adjudication of the claims and disputes, a 
jurisdiction has been carved out through the enactment of the 
Family Courts Act, 1964, creating a special forum i.e. the Family 
Court for adjudication of the family disputes in accordance with 
the special procedure as set forth in the aforesaid Act of 1964 and 
the Rules framed thereunder i.e. The West Pakistan Family Courts 
Rules, 1965. The purpose of this exercise is evident from the 
preamble of the Act of 1964 i.e. "expeditious settlement and 
disposal of disputes relating to marriage and family affairs”. The 
nature of disputes which can be brought before the Family Court 
for adjudication have been set forth and enumerated in Part I of 
the Schedule referred to in section 5 of the Act of 1964. It is now 
settled law that a purposive rather than a literal approach to 
interpretation is to be adopted while interpreting Statutes. An 
interpretation which advances the purpose of the Act is to be 
preferred rather than an interpretation which defeats its objects. 
Reference, in this behalf, may be made to the judgments reported 
as Federation of Pakistan through Ministry of Finance and others 
v. M/s. Noori Trading Corporation (Private) Limited and 14 others 
(1992 SCMR 710) and Hudabiya Engineering (Pvt.) Limited v. 
Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Interior, Government of 
Pakistan and 6 others (PLD 1998 Lahore 90). 
11. The second aspect of the Family Courts Act, 1964 and the 
Rules framed thereunder as amended from time to time would 
reveal its gender sensitivity. A glance at Section 3 of the Act of 
1964 reveals that women Judges are specifically catered for. The 
residence of the wife can be a determining factor for conferring 
territorial jurisdiction, in certain Suits as is evident from the 
provisions of Rule 6 of the West Pakistan Family Courts Rules, 
1965. There can be no escape from the fact that the tone and tenor 
of the Family Courts Act, 1964 and the Rules framed thereunder 
are beneficial in nature. It is an equally settled law that beneficial 
provisions in a Statute must be interpreted liberally in a manner 
so that the benefit conferred is advanced rather than frustrated 
or subverted. Reference, in this behalf, may be made to the 
judgments of this Court reported as Lahore Development Authority 
through D.G., Lahore and another v. Abdul Shafique and others 
(PLD 2000 SC 207) and Pakistan Engineering Co. Limited, 
Lahore through Managing Director v. Fazal Beg and 2 others 
(1992 SCMR 2166). 
12. Section 14(2) of the Family Courts Act, 1964, must necessarily 
be approached and interpreted in the above backdrop and in 
accordance with the aforesaid principles i.e. the purposive object 
thereof achieved and being beneficial in nature, the benefits so 
conferred are actualized. 
13. Subsection (1) of section 14 of the Act of 1964, confers a right 
of appeal. However, by virtue of subsection (2) of section 14 of the 
Act of 1964, this right of appeal has been curtailed. The obvious 
purpose of curtailing the right of appeal is to avoid the benefits 

W. P. No.126306 of 2017 
7 
 
of any decree which may have been passed being tied up in an 
appeal before a higher forum. It has also been noticed that in 
only three eventualities that even the right of first appeal has 
been curtailed. In all three eventualities, the decree would be for 
the benefit of the wife for dissolution of marriage under Clause 
(a), for dower or dowry under Clause (b) and for maintenance 
under Clause (c). The last may also be for the benefit of a minor. 
Thus, the only logical and reasonable interpretation, which is in 
accordance with the purposive of the Act and in line with the 
beneficial nature thereof would be that a judgment-debtor of a 
decree envisages in Clauses (a), (b) and (c) of subsection (2) of 
section 14 of the Act of 1964, would not have a right of appeal so 
that the disputes mentioned therein are resolved expeditiously 
and the benefits conferred through such decree reach the decree-
holder without being frustrated. However, the said provision 
cannot be interpreted so as to exclude a right of appeal to a wife 
whose claim of dower or dowry has been partially or entirely 
declined. For such an interpretation, would defeat the purpose 
and object of the Act of 1964 and frustrate its beneficial nature. 
14. This Court while interpreting section 14(2) of the Act of 1964, 
in its judgment reported as Tayyaba Yunus v. Muhammad Ehsan 
and others (2010 SCMR 1403) held that where a Suit for dower 
has been dismissed, the wife has a right of appeal under section 
14(2) of the above-said Act of 1964. 
15. In a case pertaining to dissolution of marriage, this Court in 
the judgment reported as Abid Hussain v. Additional District 
Judge, Alipur, District Muzaffargarh and another (2006 SCMR 
100) held as follows: 
 
"The object behind non-provision of appeal in case of dissolution 
of marriage is to protect women, an under privileged and 
generally oppressed section of our society from prolonged and 
costly litigation. It aims to put a clog on the right of husband." 
 
16. Thus, the only possible purposive beneficial and rational 
interpretation of section 14(2) of the Act of 1964, is that the right 
of appeal of a husband against whom a decree has been passed is 
curtailed, if the amount awarded is less than the amount, which 
is mentioned in the said provision. However, in no event the right 
of the wife to file an appeal is extinguished if she is dissatisfied 
with any decree in a Suit for dower or dowry.” (Emphasis 
supplied by this Court)   
 
Articles 9, 14 and 25 of the Constitution and vires of section 14(2) 
of the Act 
 
11. 
Maintenance is a basic condition for subsistence with 
dignity, as guaranteed under Articles 9 and 14 of the Constitution.  
The decree for maintenance, if any, is for the benefit of wife or a 
child.  The purpose or object of curtailing and restricting the right of 

W. P. No.126306 of 2017 
8 
 
appeal against a decree qua maintenance under section 14(2)(c) of 
the Act is to ensure that the disputes qua maintenance are resolved 
expeditiously and benefits conferred through such decree reach the 
decree holder(s) without being frustrated.  The legislature manifestly 
intends to save the wife and or child, who usually fall within the 
marginalized or disadvantage segment of the society, from having to 
incur cost, face delays and bear rigors of litigation in appeal for 
realization of a meager decretal amount specified therein.  Article 25 
of the Constitution that guarantees equality before law and 
entitlement to equal protection of law expressly preserves authority 
of the State under clause (3) thereof for making any special provision 
for the protection of women and children.  In the case of Shrin Munir 
and others vs. Government of Punjab through Secretary Health, 
Lahore and another (PLD 1990 SC 295), the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan issued the following direction to the legislatures: 
“16. Clause (2) of Article 25 prohibits distinction on the basis of 
sex alone. However, the very next clause (3) controls the rest of 
Article 25 by providing that "nothing in this Article shall prevent 
the State from enacting any special provision for the protection 
of women and children". It implies, therefore, that while the 
difference on the basis of sex can be created and maintained, it 
shall be done only in those cases where it operates favourably 
as a protective measure for and not against women and 
children. The field of prohibition, of adopting sex, as a criteria 
for making a distinction, is thereby reduced to only that category 
wherein sex is adopted as a standard for discriminating against 
females generally and against males only if it is not as a measure 
protective of females. Discrimination against a group or an 
individual implies making an adverse distinction with regard to 
same benefit, advantage or facility. All pervasive nature of this 
constitutional provision is self evident. In interpreting 
Constitution and also in giving effect to the various legislative 
measures, one distinction has to be consistently kept in view 
and it is that classification based on reasonable considerations 
is permissible and not violative of the principle." (Emphasis 
supplied by this Court)  
 
Threshold of Rs.5000/- cumulative or per claimant   
12. 
Plea of the petitioners that curtailment of right of appeal 
under section 14(2)(c) of the Act is confined to a decree,  which is 
cumulatively for an amount of Rs.5000/- or less per month is not 

W. P. No.126306 of 2017 
9 
 
supported by the very language of the said provision.  It is nowhere 
specified in clause 14(2)(c) that no appeal shall lie from a decree 
cumulatively for an amount of Rs.5000/- or less per month.  Had the 
legislature intended so, it would have added words “in aggregate” or 
“in total” after the words five thousand occurring in clause (c) of 
section 14(2) ibid.  It is trite law that reading in of words or meaning 
into a statutory provision is not permissible when its meaning is 
otherwise clear. As a matter of statutory interpretation, Courts 
generally abstain from providing omissions in a statute.  Reliance in 
this regard is placed on the cases of Messrs State Cement 
Corporation of Pakistan Ltd. Vs. Collector of Customs, Karachi and 
another (1998 PTD 2999), Abdul Haq Khan and others vs. Haji 
Ameerzada and others (PLD 2017 Supreme Court 105) and Deputy 
Director Finance and Administration FATA through Additional 
Chief Secretary FATA, Peshawar and others vs. Dr. Lal Marjan and 
others (2022 SCMR 566).  There are several legislative examples 
where expressions such as aggregate amount, amount in total or 
amount in aggregate have been used by the Federal or Provincial 
legislatures in various statutes, which is conspicuously absent in 
section 14(2)(c) of the Act.  Reference in this regard is made to the 
provisions of rule 48(1)(b) of Order XXI, rule 11(b) of Order 
XXXIV and section 34 & its sub-section (2) of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908, section 17 of the Court Fees Act, 1870, sections 
21(1), 100C(3)(f), 113(2)(a) and 153(1)(a)&(b) of the Income Tax 
Ordinance, 2001.  When the amount of Rs.5000/- or less is not 
specified in section 14(2)(c) to be in aggregate, the decree passed for 
such an amount for each of the claimants remains not appealable.  
The decree may be passed in a suit allowing, rejecting or partly 
allowing claims of plaintiffs therein.  The claim for maintenance in 
relation to each of the plaintiffs constitutes an independent cause of 
action that may be allowed, rejected or partly allowed in favour of 
any plaintiff.  The plaintiffs can jointly file their claims or separately.  

W. P. No.126306 of 2017 
10 
 
Each claim is to be adjudicated in terms of respective entitlement of 
the plaintiffs.  Even if separate plaints are presented on behalf of 
each of the claimants, because of the overlapping assertions, 
consolidation of suits for adjudication remains a serious legal and 
pragmatic possibility.  If, for example, three children of a judgment 
debtor have been held entitled by the Family Court to maintenance at 
the rate of Rs.4000/- per month each, it would be anomalous and 
absurd interpretation of section 14(2)(c) to suggest that the judgment 
debtor shall be entitled to prefer an appeal against such decree when 
passed in a single suit on the pretext that the decree is to be 
cumulatively considered for an amount of Rs.5000/- or less per 
month, however, his right of appeal under the said provision is 
restricted if decrees to the same effect are passed in three suits 
instituted on behalf of each of the children of the judgment debtor. 
This would unnecessarily encourage multiplicity of proceedings 
without 
any 
substantive 
basis thereby 
adversely 
affecting 
administration of justice in family cases, therefore, such 
interpretation must be avoided.  Reliance in this regard is placed on 
the cases of Central Government of Pakistan and others vs. Suleman 
Khan and others (PLD 1992 Supreme Court 590) and Uzin Export 
Import Enterprises For Foreign Trade, Karachi vs. Union Bank of 
Middle East Ltd. (PLD 1994 Supreme Court 95).    
13. 
Additionally, it has been aptly noted by the learned 
Judge in Chamber of this Court in the case of “Sarfraz vs. Additional 
District Judge and 5 others (2017 YLR 1684) that: -   
“7 ….. 
(a) ……. 
(b) ……. 
(c) for maintenance of rupees five thousand or per month. 
………..it is not a matter of pecuniary jurisdiction of the court 
rather it is a matter of right of minors and wives who are 
constrained to live a deserted life and Section 14(2)(c) of the Act 
mentions the amount of maintenance allowance for a single person 
and not the accumulative one for all the children and wife. If it is 
accepted as held by the Hon'ble Judge, what would happen if such 

W. P. No.126306 of 2017 
11 
 
number is five or more as in such a situation, the protection 
provided by Section 14(2)(c) of the Act would go down even below 
the level of Rs.1,000/- which was the limit provided before the 
recent amendment made in 2015 and would be highly insufficient 
for survival of any individual. In my view, the legislature vide said 
amendment has desired to increase the earlier limit of Rs.1,000/- to 
Rs.5,000/- per head and has not fixed it as a whole for all those who 
have such right against one person. As such, I am of the considered 
view that since the amount of maintenance allowance granted to 
each of the plaintiffs was less than Rs.5,000/-, the appeal keeping in 
view Section 14(2)(c) of the Act was not maintainable. 
8. Even otherwise, the minors are admittedly children of the 
petitioner and it is his responsibility to maintain them for which 
meager amounts of Rs.4,500/- for each of the minor have been 
awarded which are hardly sufficient to meet with the requirements 
of the minors keeping in view their day-to-day needs of food, abode, 
clothing, schooling etc.  The petitioner being father of the minors 
cannot be allowed to escape from his responsibilities of 
maintaining their children under any law of the land.” 
 
14. 
In view of the foregoing, it is found that in terms of 
section 14(2)(c) of the Act, a decree for maintenance granted for an 
amount less than Rs.5000/- per month to each of the plaintiffs is not 
appealable. 
Scope of Article 10-A of the Constitution and vires of section 14(2) 
of the Act   
 
15. 
In order to deal with the other question as to whether 
the provisions of subsection (2) of section 14 of the Act are void 
being repugnant to Article 10A of the Constitution, it would be 
proper to reproduce the said Article: - 
“10A. Right to fair trial.-- For the determination of his civil rights 
and obligations or in any criminal charge against him a person 
shall be entitled to a fair trial and due process.” 
 
While Article 10A of the Constitution guarantees right to fair trial 
and due process for the determination of civil rights and obligations 
of a person, however, there is nothing in the language of the said 
article that guarantees at least one right of appeal against all such 
determinations.  It has been held in paragraphs No.18 & 19 of the 

W. P. No.126306 of 2017 
12 
 
judgment dated 19.06.2023 passed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
in Constitution Petitions No.21, 22 & 23 of 2023 that:- 
“18.  
A contemporary article with similar characteristics as 
Article 10-A of our Constitution can be found in Article 6 of the 
European Convention on Human Rights (“ECHR”). For ease of 
reference, the relevant portion of the said Article for the purpose of 
these petitions i.e. Article 6(1) is reproduced hereunder: 
“Article 6 Right to fair trial 
(1) In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or 
of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a 
fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an 
independent and impartial tribunal established by law ...” 
 
In this context, the High Court of England & Wales in Dorairaj 
vs. Bar Standards Board ([2018] EWHC 2762 (Admin)) was petitioned 
to declare certain sections of the Crime and Courts Act of 2013 
incompatible with Article 6 of the ECHR on the ground that an 
independent appellate forum was not available. While dismissing the 
application seeking a declaration of incompatibility, the High Court 
held that: 
 
“44. … Whilst article 6 guarantees an individual a right to a 
fair trial, where an article 6-compliant decision is made by a 
court, it is trite law that article 6 does not guarantee a right of 
appeal (see, e.g., Porter v United Kingdom [1987] Application 
No 12972/87) ..” 
 
Similarly, in Sablon vs. Belgium (Application No.36445/97 @ 
para 86), the European Court of Human Rights held that Article 6 did 
not apply to the examination of an application to reopen civil 
proceedings.” 
      
Repugnancy to Injunctions of Islam  
 
16. 
In the case of Federation of Pakistan and others vs. 
Public At Large and others (PLD 1988 Supreme Court 202), while 
deciding Civil Shariat Appeals from the judgment dated 27.03.1984 
passed by the Federal Shariat Court declaring various provisions of 
the West Pakistan Press and Publications Ordinance, (XXX of 1963) 
to be repugnant to injunctions of Islamic, it was held that section 48 
of the said Ordinance be amended to the effect that in addition to the 
appeal provided for therein in respect of the orders already specified 
in section 48, an appeal shall also be competent against the orders 
passed under sections 4, 12, 9, 10 and 24.   
 
Likewise, in the case of Pakistan through Secretary 
Ministry of Defence vs. General Public (PLD 1989 SC 6), Shariat 
Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan declared section 
133 of the Pakistan Army Act (XXI of 1962), section 140 of 

W. P. No.126306 of 2017 
13 
 
Pakistan Navy Ordinance (XXXV of 1961) and section 162 of the 
Pakistan Air Force Act, 1953 to be repugnant to injunctions of Islam 
barred the remedy of appeal against conviction by the Court Martials 
and the necessary amendments were ordered to be carried out by 1st 
January, 1989.   
Recently, the above views were endorsed by the 15 Members Full 
Bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan on 11.10.2023 in 
Constitutional Petition No.6 rejecting a challenge to vires of the right 
of appeal to a Larger Bench conferred by section 5 of the Supreme 
Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023 from an order under 
Article 184(3) of the Constitution while observing as under:-  
“A standard good worldwide practice and the Injunctions 
of Islam, require that an appeal be provided and when two 
interpretations are possible, the one that conforms with the 
Injunctions of Islam shall be adopted.”   
 
Be that as it may, it is noteworthy that in view of the provisions of 
Article 203D, it is essentially authority of the Federal Shariat Court, 
if any, to declare any law repugnant to injunctions of Islam and 
jurisdiction of this Court in that regard is indeed expressly barred 
under Article 203G of the Constitution.  Resultantly, we are unable 
to declare the provision of section 14(2)(c) of the Act to be 
repugnant to injunctions of Islam.  
Effect of annual increase under section 17A(3) of the Act 
17. 
As regards plea qua annual increase under section 
17A(3) of the Act, suffice it to say that the said provision comes into 
operation where the Family Court has failed to prescribe the annual 
increase in the maintenance while passing the judgment and decree.  
Annual increase under the said provision does not form part of 
adjudication resulting in the decree, however, the same is 
automatically enforceable by operation of law, therefore, it cannot be 
taken into consideration for the purpose of section 14(2)(c) of the 
Act. 
 

W. P. No.126306 of 2017

Effectiveness of the remedy under Article 199 of the Constitution  
18. 
There is no cavil to the proposition that remedy under 
Article 199 of the Constitution cannot be equated with the right of 
appeal provided under any law inasmuch as the former is confined to 
interference in the cases of violation of law whereas the latter 
includes arriving at any point of view after reappraisal of evidence.  
Reliance in this regard is placed on the cases of Shajar Islam vs. 
Muhammad Siddique and 2 others (PLD 2007 Supreme Court 45), 
Mst. Tayyeba Ambareen and another vs. Shafqat Ali Kiyani and 
another (2023 SCMR 246) and M. Hamad Hassan vs. Mst. Isma 
Bukhari and 2 others (2023 SCMR 1434).  However, the 
curtailment of right of appeal under section 14(2)(c) of the Act is in 
very limited circumstances which does not unreasonably restrict 
access to justice when this Court, in its supervisory jurisdiction 
under Article 199 of the Constitution, keeps a check on whether the 
judgment impugned in such proceedings is based on any patent 
violation of law, disregard of evidence available on the file or in 
denial of fair procedure which ought to have been followed in the 
facts and circumstances of the case.  Needless to reiterate that Article 
25(3) of the Constitution permits special provisions to be made for 
the benefit of women and children and the right of appeal of a 
husband or father has been ousted under section 14(2)(c) of the Act 
only in such limited cases where the amount of maintenance was 
deemed by the legislature to be meager.  
Provision of legal aid 
19. 
Adjudication 
of 
claims 
entail 
physical 
and 
psychological toil, incurring of financial resources and a degree of 
perseverance to succeed for the enforcement of one’s rights.  More 
often than not, it is quite an ordeal for a resourceless wife and/or 
child to invoke jurisdiction of the Family Court to claim 
maintenance when a husband/father fails to perform his obligation in 
that regard, particularly in the absence of a well established legal aid 

W. P. No.126306 of 2017

system. Province of the Punjab, through Act No.XIX of 2018, 
enacted the Punjab Legal Aid Act, 2018 section 3 whereof provides 
for Punjab Legal Aid Agency to be established by the Government 
by notification in the official gazette to provide legal aid service to 
an indigent person, inter alia, in family disputes relating to divorce, 
maintenance, dowry, dower or custody of children.  However, the 
said agency has not been operationalized till date.  To ensure 
effective enforcement of the rights of access to justice and fair trial 
as guaranteed under Article 9 and 10A of the Constitution to women 
and children, Government of the Punjab is directed to operationalize 
the Punjab Legal Aid Agency within a period of three months to 
provide legal aid services to indigent persons in the family matters.   
Conclusion 
20. 
The 
above-mentioned 
questions 
are 
answered 
accordingly, however, the ultimate fate of these petitions shall be 
decided individually by the respective Single Bench in the light of 
above discussion, keeping in view the facts and circumstances of 
each case.  Before parting, we would like to record our special 
thanks for the able assistance rendered by the learned Amici Curiae.
