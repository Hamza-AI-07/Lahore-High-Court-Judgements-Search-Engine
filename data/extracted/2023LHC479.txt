Mr. Umer Hameed Khan, Advocate.   
 
 
Raheel Kamran J:- Through this petition under Section 
115 of the Code of Civil procedure, 1908 (‘CPC’) the petitioners 
have assailed the judgment and decree dated 21.10.2013 passed 
by the learned District Judge, Kasur allowing appeal of the 
respondents against dismissal of their suit for declaration vide 
judgment and decree dated 06.11.2010, passed by the learned 
Civil Judge, Kasur, for being not maintainable.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners contends that the suit 
instituted by the respondents was filed after 25 years of alleged 
accrual of cause of action, therefore, the same was time barred, 
hence the trial court had taken the correct view in rejecting the 
plaint and the learned appellate court has clearly erred in law in 
remanding the matter to the trial court with direction to frame 
issues, record evidence and decide the case afresh on merits. He 
maintains that suit instituted by the respondents was clearly 
barred by law and conversion of the same into application under 
Section 12(2) of CPC was out of question. Even otherwise, he 
adds, it was not mandatory for the court adjudicating upon an 
application under Section 12(2) of the CPC to frame issues and 
record evidence in every case and in the instant case application

of the respondents was liable to be dismissed outrightly as was 
done by the court of first instance. In support of his contentions, 
he has relied upon judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the case of Bashir Ahmed through Legal 
Representatives and others v. Muhammad Hussain and others 
(PLD 2019 SC 504).  
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the represented 
respondents has supported the impugned judgment and decree 
for the reasons stated therein. He maintains that the suit of the 
respondents has rightly been treated as an application under 
Section 12(2) of the CPC in view of law enunciated by the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Noorul Amin 
and another v. Muhammad Hashim and 27 others (1992 SCMR 
1744). He adds that the pleas of fraud and limitation in this case 
could not be determined without framing any issue and 
recording evidence whereas in the instant case no such exercise 
was carried out by the civil court which proceeded to dismiss 
their claim in a slipshod manner which has been rightly reversed 
by the appellate court.  
4. 
Heard. Record perused.  
5. 
The operative part of the impugned judgment and decree 
reads as follows:- 
“8. 
The perusal of the record shows that the suit for pre-
emption was decreed in favour of respondents No.4 and 5 on 
08.09.1979 and the mutation No.1770 was sanctioned in 
furtherance of the decree on 03.12.1981. The learned trial Court 
held that as the mutation was sanctioned on 03.12.1981 so the 
plaintiffs’ act of challenging the decree by way of independent suit 
is barred by section 12(2) of the CPC. This Court does not agree 
with the learned trial Court. The reason is that plaintiffs have 
challenged the validity of decree dated 08.9.1979. The decree was 
passed before the insertion of section 12(2) of the CPC. This 
amendment was made in the year 1980. However, it at all it is 
taken to be granted that the period shall be counted from the date 
of attestation of the mutation (which is not lawful in any manner) 
even then the independent suit is competent and the learned trial 
Court 
was 
not 
justified 
to 
dismiss 
the 
suit. 
The 
plaintiffs/appellants specifically mentioned that the decree was 
obtained by fraud so the learned trial Court should have decided 
the matter on merits instead of dismissing the suit on 
technicalities. It would have been more appropriate for the 
learned trial Court to frame the issues and decide the case instead 
of dismissing the suit on this sole ground. As the 
appellants/plaintiffs challenged the validity of decree on the 

3 
Civil Revision. No.192 of 2014. 
 
grounds of fraud so the learned trial Court should have treated 
the suit as an application under Section 12(2) of the CPC.…..” 
 
6. 
 It is well settled, that all procedural laws are meant for 
advancing the cause of justice and they cannot be made a vehicle 
of oppression to suppress the remedies. It is also well-accepted 
principle of law that Courts always lean in favour of adjudication 
on merit rather than stifling proceedings on technicalities. A 
cursory reading of the plaint in the instant case, instituted by the 
plaintiffs-respondents specially alleged in their plaint shows that 
the decree impugned therein was obtained by fraud and the same 
could not deprive of the Court to its jurisdiction to decide it as 
an application under Section 12(2) of the CPC if otherwise such 
jurisdiction was available to the court under the law, therefore, 
the learned appellate court was justified in converting 
into/treating the suit to be an application under Section 12(2) of 
the CPC and no prejudice was caused to the petitioners-
defendants. Reliance in this regard is placed on judgment of the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Noorul Amin 
and another v. Muhammad Hashim and 27 others (1992 SCMR 
1744). 
7. 
As regards direction of the appellate court to the Civil 
Court to frame issues, record evidence and thereafter decide the 
case afresh on merits, suffice it to say that it is not mandatory in 
every case to frame issue and record evidence for disposal of an 
application under Section 12(2) of the CPC. Sub-section (3) of 
Section 12 of the CPC governs the procedure to be adopted by 
the Court while disposing of an application under Section 12(2) 
of the CPC and without first allowing an opportunity to the civil 
court in that regard, the direction issued by the appellate court is 
unwarranted by law, thus, liable to be interference with. In the 
case of Sheikh Haroon-u-Rehman v. Muhammad Rafique and 
others (2022 CLC 167), it has been held by this Court that:- 
“7. 
Prior to insertion of sub-section (3) in Section 12 of the Code 
through Punjab Act No. XIV of 2018 dated 20.03.2018, no procedure 
was prescribed for the disposal of an application under Section 12(2) of 

4 
Civil Revision. No.192 of 2014. 
 
the Code, however, in cases where the determination of allegations of 
fraud and misrepresentation involved investigation into the question of 
fact, inquiry was ordinarily held to adjudicate upon the matter by 
framing an issue and recording evidence while invoking the provision of 
Section 141 of the Code. It was, however, held in various judgments of 
the apex Court to be not mandatory to frame issues and record evidence 
for the disposal of an application under Section 12(2) of the Code as the 
court had to regulate its proceedings keeping in view nature of the 
allegations made in the application and adopt such mode as was in 
consonance with justice in the facts and circumstances of the case. It was 
further held that framing of issues in every case to examine merits of 
such application would frustrate the object of Section 12(2) of the Code 
which is to avoid protracted and time consuming litigation and to save 
the genuine decree holders from grave hardships, ordeal of further 
litigation, extra burden on their exchequer and simultaneously to reduce 
unnecessary burden on the courts. Reliance in this regard is placed on 
the cases of Ghulam Muhammad v. Ahmed Khan (1993 SCMR 662); 
Amiran Bibi and others v. Muhammad Ramzan and others (1999 SCMR 
1334); Ms. Amina Bibi v. Nasrullah and others (2000 SCMR 296); Mst. 
Nasira Khatoon and another v. Mst. Aisha Bai and 12 others (2003 
SCMR 1050) and Warriach Zarai Corporation v. F.M.C. United (Pvt.) 
Ltd. (2006 SCMR 531). 
8. 
A perusal of Section 12(3) of the Code clearly indicates that: 
firstly, an application under Section 12(2) of the Code has been required 
by law to be disposed of expeditiously; secondly, for expeditious disposal 
of such an application, a discretion has been conferred upon the court 
to adopt such procedure as the circumstance of the case warrant; thirdly, 
the procedure to be adopted by the court must be fair in the 
circumstances of the case; fourthly, if proof etc. of any fact is required, 
it shall be proved or disproved by affidavit unless directed otherwise by 
the court; and lastly, reasons must be recorded in the order where the 
court directs any fact to be proved or disproved otherwise than by way 
of affidavit. It is thus manifest that the requirements of a regular trial 
vis-à-vis framing of issues and recording of evidence have been 
generally dispensed with by the legislature in adjudication of 
applications under Section 12(2) of the Code and the court has been 
burdened with the responsibility to record reasons for resorting to such 
procedure in exceptional cases.” 
 
8. 
As regards plea of the petitioners that claim of the 
respondents is barred by limitation, suffice it to say that the 
period of limitation to file an application under Section 12(2) of 
the CPC is governed by Article 181 of the Limitation Act, 1908. 
While interpreting the Article 181 ibid, it has been held by the 
Hon’ble Supreme of Pakistan in the case of Bashir Ahmed 
through LRs and others v. Muhammad Hussain and others (PLD 
2019 SC 504):-  
“A careful reading of the above provision clearly reveals that the 
period of limitation to file an application under Section 12(2) of 
the CPC would be three years, and the crucial starting point for 
the period of limitation would be when the right to apply accrues 
to the aggrieved applicant, which in case of an application under 
Section 12(2) of the CPC would be the date when the impugned 
decision based on fraud and concealment was passed. In case the 
aggrieved person has, by means of fraud, been kept from the 
knowledge of decision of the Court, he may then seek the extension 
of the commencing point of the period of limitation of three years 
from the date of the decision under Article 181 of the Act, to the 
date of knowledge of the said decision under Section 18 (supra).”

Civil Revision. No.192 of 2014. 
 
 
9. 
From perusal of the pleadings in the instant case, it is 
manifest that claim of the respondents is based on alleged fraud 
and it has been averred in their plaint (to be treated as application 
under Section 12(2) of the CPC) the date of knowledge to be one 
month prior to institution of the suit. In his decision dated 
06.11.2010, while dismissing suit of the respondents, the learned 
Civil Judge, Kasur did not at all consider application of Section 
18 of the Limitation Act, 1908. The civil court manifestly 
proceeded to dismiss claim of the respondents in a cursory and 
slipshod manner which rendered the same unsustainable in law. 
Since the matter has already been remanded by the Appellate 
Court for decision afresh on claim of the respondents while 
treating their plaint to be an application under Section 12(2) of 
the CPC, therefore, this Court would refrain from making any 
further comment on the subject of limitation lest the same may 
prejudice case of the either side.  
10. 
For the foregoing reasons, this civil revision is partly 
allowed and the impugned judgment and decree dated 
21.10.2013 passed by the learned District Judge, Kasur is hereby 
set aside and the learned civil court shall proceed with the 
application of the respondents in accordance with sub-section 
(3) of Section 12 of the CPC. This being an old matter, the 
learned Civil Judge is directed to proceed with adjudication of 
the application expeditiously without granting unnecessary 
adjournments to either side. There shall be no order as to costs.
