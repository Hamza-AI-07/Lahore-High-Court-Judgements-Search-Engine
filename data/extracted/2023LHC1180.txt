Petitioner by: 
M/s Muhammad Azhar Siddique, 
Zeeshan Afzaal Hashmi and Roha 
Khan, Advocates. 
Respondents by: 
Mr. 
Nasar

Division, Islamabad.   
 
ASIM HAFEEZ, J.  Fundamentally, subject matter controversy is whether 
denial on the part of the Federal Cabinet / Government (‘Government’) to 
disclose / public the record of „Tosha-Khana‟ is lawful and justiciable, and if such 
act is covered within the scope of privileges available in terms of section 7 clause 
(f) & (g) and section 16 (1) clause (a)(ii) of the Right of Access to Information 
Act, 2017 (Act, 2017). Government claimed that record of „Tosha-Khana‟ is 
classified, and immunity is available because disclosure of such information / 
details would be prejudicial to the interests of the State of Pakistan and 

W.P. No.80733/2022

detrimental to international relations. Petitioner had sought but denied access to 
information. Hence, instant petition.  
2. 
In support of alleged claim of privileged information, Government was 
directed to produce unpublished record in the Chambers and submit affidavit of 
the head of the department of the „Tosha-Khana‟, as per the requirements of 
Article 6 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984. Affidavit of Mr. Amir Ashraf 
Khawaja, Cabinet Secretary is produced, contents whereof are reproduced 
hereunder, 
“I, Aamir Ashraf Khawaja, Cabinet Secretary, do hereby solemnly affirm and 
declare as under:- 
 
1. The Toshakhana was made the responsibility of Cabinet Division under 
Rules of Business 1973. 
2. Prior to 1973, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and Establishment 
Division were responsible for it. 
3. On the Orders of the Honorable Court, the record was sought by the 
Cabinet Division from MOFA and Establishment vide letter No.8/5/2017-
TK dated 24-02-2023. 
4. The Ministry of Foreign affairs(MOFA) vide letter No.DCP (V-VII)-1-
Misc/2023 and Establishment Division letter No.1/2/2023-Admn-III dated 
02.03.2023, have written that no record of Toshakhana is available with 
them. 
5. That the complete information from 2002 onwards is submitted to the 
Honourable Court for perusal (in camera). 
6. That as already submitted, the information/record available with the 
Cabinet Division (from 1973 to 2001) is sketchy/unverifiable. As directed 
by the Honourable Court, whatever is available is being submitted for 
perusal (in camera). 
7. That the information submitted for perusal (in camera) is strictly as per 
record of Toshakhana (Both verified and unverifiable) and that nothing 
has been withheld. 
8. The Federal Cabinet on 22-02-2023 has declassified the information 
(without name of presenting dignitary/country). The same is being 
displayed on website of the Cabinet Division. The new approved 
Toshakhana procedure is now in vogue.  
9. The uploaded Toshakhana information 2002 onwards till to date is in 
compliance of the Cabinet approval contained in its decision dated 22-02-
2023. This information is based on Toshakhana record as per declaration 
by all concerned in accordance with the “procedure for Acceptance and 
Disposal of Gifts”.

3. 
Government, pendente-lite proceedings, released limited record of 
„Tosha-Khana‟ from the year 2002 till March 13th, 2023, but with a caveat that 
identity / source(s) of the providers of gift(s) was withheld, on the plea that 
disclosure would have repercussions and impact on the foreign relations. It was 
informed that Cabinet had constituted committee for reviewing the regulatory 
regime of „Tosha-Khana‟ and to recommend statutory framework for dealing 
with the procedure for acceptance and disposal of foreign gifts.  
 
Government showed reluctance in disclosing record of „Tosha Khana‟ 
from 1990 to 2001, on the premise that record was incomplete and otherwise 
unverifiable – supporting material for authentication is missing. Government 
categorically informed that record before the year 1990 is not available. It is 
alleged that Cabinet assumed control of the record of „Tosha-Khana‟ after 1973, 
before which Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Establishment Division were 
responsible for maintaining the record, and non-availability of record was 
confirmed upon intimation by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Aforesaid facts are 
iterated in the Affidavit. Learned Additional Attorney General placed on record 
signed copies of record of „Tosha-Khana‟, already released for public 
consumption, which is made part of these proceedings. – wherein source(s) / 
identity of the providers of gifts was not disclosed.  
4. 
Upon hearing learned Additional Attorney General, following issues 
arise and need determination. 
 
i. Whether ownership of the gifts under reference vests in the 
Government or recipient of gift(s), and at what point in time 
ownership in the gift(s) changes hands? 
 
 
 
ii. Whether failure to disclose / declare gifts by the recipient constitute 
culpable wrongdoing, liable to appropriate action?  
 

W.P. No.80733/2022

iii. Whether immunity claimed qua the source(s) / identity of providers 
of gift(s) provider is lawfully claimable? 
 
 
iv. Whether Government is lawfully justified in claiming immunity 
from disclosure of record of ‘Tosha-Khana’ from 1990 to 2001? 
 
5. 
Learned Additional Attorney General submits that gifts provided, either 
by the heads of foreign State(s) or foreign dignitaries to the Government / Public 
functionaries of Pakistan are not by virtue of any private relationship or 
individual bond but due to their status as the Government / Public functionaries, 
being representatives of the Government of Pakistan. Submits that foreign gift(s) 
cannot be construed as private gifts. Adds that recipient(s) of gifts are legally 
obligated to disclose and declare the details of the gifts received – 
notwithstanding absence of protocol staff at the occasion. Further submits that if 
recipient(s) intends to acquire gifts, they must convey their intention to purchase, 
whereupon procedure for disposal of gifts is followed, in terms whereof, 
evaluation is carried out for determining the payable price. Adds that upon 
payment of ascertained price by recipient(s) ownership in the gift(s) changes 
hands. Learned Additional Attorney General submits that immunity for the period 
from 1990 to 2001 is claimed since the record was incomplete and not duly 
verifiable. Upon being asked, law officer submits that official records are 
maintained and preserved for fixed timeframe and thereafter the record is 
disposed / destroyed after fulfilling legal / administrative requirements.  
  
On the issue of immunity qua the identity / source(s) of gift(s) 
providers, learned Additional Attorney General submit that head(s) of some 
foreign states are generous and gave valuable gifts to the Government / Public 
functionaries, and if their identity is disclosed, such disclosure would create 
frenzy, generate unnecessary speculation and affect foreign relations. Adds that 

W.P. No.80733/2022 
5
disclosure of identity / source of gifts providers is otherwise against the 
diplomatic norms. 
 
 
ORDER OF THE COURT. 
6. 
Before addressing the questions, it is imperative to identify the class of 
Government / Public functionaries, those are subject to the regulatory framework 
of gifts and disposal thereof. Clause (13) of the „Procedure for the Acceptance 
and Disposal of Gifts‟ of 18.12.2018 describes class of persons, which is 
reproduced hereunder for understanding,[by and large the scope of Government / 
Public functionaries remain similar in the context of procedures prescribed from 
time to time.]  
“The procedure shall apply to the President/Head of the Government and their 
family members, Chairman Senate, Speaker National Assembly, Chief Justice of 
the Supreme Court, Governors of the Provinces, Members of the Federal 
Cabinet, Attorney General for Pakistan, Ministers of State, Deputy Chairman 
Senate, Deputy Speaker national Assembly, Dignitaries holding ministerial 
status, Members of Provincial Cabinets, Judges of Supreme Court, Chief 
Justice/Judges of the High Courts, Parliamentarians and other elected 
representatives, all Government servants (Civil and Military) as well as 
autonomous bodies and their spouse/dependents, members of the Provincial 
Governments, other members of public visiting abroad as members of official 
delegation.”   
[Emphasis supplied] 
 
7. 
During hearing of the case learned Additional Attorney General is asked 
to confirm that complete information / details of all the recipients of gift(s) for the 
period from 2002 till 11.03.2023 is publicized, who categorically stated that 
details of the gifts and recipients thereof are provided, but with respect to those 
gifts which are disclosed / declared by the recipients, and no information was 
available with respect to undisclosed / undeclared gifts. It is difficult to 
individually identify the identity of those Government / Public functionaries who 

W.P. No.80733/2022 
6
had received gift(s) from the head(s) of the foreign states / dignitary(ies) but 
failed to disclose / declare the gifts.  
  
In the context of the concerns expressed by the learned counsel for the 
petitioner that record was incomplete, it is iterated that all Government Servants, 
(Civil and Military) Chief Justice and Judges of the Supreme Court and Chief 
Justices / Judges of the High Courts and other Constitutional Courts, are obligated 
to report, disclose and declare the gift(s) received, and non-reporting incurs action 
suggested in terms of Clause (1) of the Procedure for the Acceptance and 
Disposal of Gifts. Clause (1), ibid, which reads as,  
“The responsibility for reporting the receipt of the gifts shall devolve on the 
individual recipient. All gifts received by a Government servant, irrespective 
of their prices, must be reported to the Toshakhana in the Cabinet Division, 
Government of Pakistan. If it is found, on checking, that an individual has not 
reported the receipt of a gift, appropriate action will be taken against him 
under the relevant rules.”    
[Emphasis supplied] 
 
8. 
There is no second thought that ownership of gift(s) received 
exclusively vests in the Government of Pakistan. Undoubtedly, option of 
purchase is available to the recipient but only upon fulfilling the procedural and 
codal / legal requirements. And upon payment of price, as determined, ownership 
in the gifts is conferred on the recipient – [there are gifts, whose prices are either 
below the permissible limit or so insignificant that retention is allowed without 
any payment. This category of gifts is different]. I concur with the submissions of 
learned Additional Attorney General that gifts are not provided to the individuals, 
out of any personal affection or bonding, but being the Government / Public 
functionaries, representing the State of Pakistan - this status / privilege is an 
essential qualification for the recipient of gift(s). Families / members of official 
delegations are subject to same limitations, obligations and procedure(s), as 

W.P. No.80733/2022 
7
applicable to the Government / Public functionaries. In every case, the dominion 
over the gift(s) remains with the Government and possession of the gifts is a mere 
entrustment. Recipient(s), entrusted with the property, may seek purchase of gifts 
but subject to the procedure prescribed for disposal – which inter alia includes the 
first step of disclosure of gift(s), declaration of intention to purchase, assessment / 
ascertainment of the price and payment of consideration. And unless all these 
requisite conditions are met, the ownership in the gift(s) or dominion over them 
vests and continues to vest in the Government, and recipient is merely a trustee, 
holding gift(s) on behalf of the Government of Pakistan –gift(s), held as trustee, 
will not even became the part of the estate of the recipient, unless procedure 
prescribed is followed.  
  
In view of the above, it is declared that act of non-disclosure, non-
declaration or non-payment of price qua the gift(s) is culpable wrongdoing, 
attracting malfeasance, misconduct and breach of trust. It is expected that 
Government / Public functionaries, those who had received the gift(s) but had, so 
far, neither disclosed nor declared the identity of gifts, must voluntarily declare 
receipt / possession of gifts, failing which said persons are likely to be exposed to 
criminal action or departmental proceedings, as the case may be. It is pertinent to 
mention that criminal breach of trust is otherwise a punishable offence under 
Pakistan Penal Code 1860. Nobody is above the law, nor anyone could be 
allowed to make gains or enrich itself at the expense of causing loss to the State 
and prejudice to the people of Pakistan. 
9.  
Another matter is regarding the immunity claimed qua disclosure of 
source (s) / identity of providers of gift(s). Reasons pleaded are heightened 
speculation and unnecessary debate amongst the public and repercussions for 

W.P. No.80733/2022 
8
foreign relations. This reasoning is fallacious and ridiculously absurd. Learned 
Additional Attorney General when asked, failed to show that non-disclosure of 
the identity / source(s) of the providers of gift(s) is a universally followed 
practice, or established principles of successful diplomacy or foreign relations. 
Foreign relations / policy is always guided and directed in the context of the 
interest of the State and benefit of its people. Source(s) / identity of the 
provider(s) of gift(s) is not a state secret, nor was it treated as scared information, 
either in our neighbouring country, on the eastern border, or in western 
democracies, where gifts received are accordingly disclosed along identity of the 
providers of those gift(s). Shyness on the part of the Government is difficult to 
comprehend. It is believed that claim of immunity pleaded is nothing but a 
figment of colonial mindset, which mindset must be abandoned / off-loaded now, 
if Rule of law and equality before the law need to be established. Now, after 
seventy-five years of our independence it is imperative that people of Pakistan be 
treated as citizens / fountainhead of all power, instead of being the subjects in 
colonial set-up. People of Pakistan have the right to know details of ‘Tosha-
Khana’, what was gifted and who gifted it. 
  
This Court is of the considered opinion that disclosure of the source(s) / 
identity of the providers of gifts, even if gifts provided are expensive and 
manifests the generosity of the providers / donors, would in fact promote and 
foster good feelings between the people and above all bring transparency in the 
affairs of the State. It is absurd to conceive that sovereignty of Pakistan or its 
relations with foreign States would be jeopardized, threatened, risked or exposed 
merely upon disclosing the source(s) / identity of the providers of gift(s). 
Objection qua non-disclosure of the source(s) / identity of the provider(s) of 

W.P. No.80733/2022 
9
gift(s) is unwarranted, and in fact withholding of such information would 
generate speculations and enhance distrust between people and Government / 
Public functionaries. Non-disclosure of information is in fact denial of right of the 
people of Pakistan to know, rights which are available and enjoyed by citizens of 
other countries / nations. Gifts provided are not offered or provided for forging 
personal relationship or individual bonding, nor for surreptitiously gaining veiled 
/ hidden political or economic benefits. Pakistan is not an exception in the world, 
that its foreign relations would be adversely affected merely because information 
/ details of „Tosha-Khana‟ are shared with the people of Pakistan. In view of the 
above, no substantial ground is available to extend the immunity claimed, which 
claim of the Government is unjustified and same is repelled. Provisions of the 
Right of Access to Information Act 2017 and Articles 6 and 158 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984 extends no support qua alleged claim of immunity, in the 
context of record of „Tosha-Khana‟. Rights of the People of Pakistan to know 
details of the source(s) / identity of provider(s) of gift(s) cannot be denied, 
curtailed or curbed on flimsy reasons / grounds. 
10. 
Now I deal with the issue of disclosure of record of „Tosha Khana‟ from 
1990 to 2001. Grounds pleaded are that record for the relevant period is 
incomplete and unverifiable, hence, immunity be extended. This is no ground at 
all let alone persuasive enough to declare the record classified. Claim of 
immunity is a mere excuse to keep the details buried, allowing it to be removed / 
destroyed surreptitiously, in the manner the records from 1947 to 1990 are found 
missing. It is expected that Government will hold an inquiry into the factum of 
loss of record, its partial availability, ascertain cause for disappearance / no-

W.P. No.80733/2022 
10
availability of the records, fix responsibility and hold the perpetrators liable / 
accountable. 
  
In view of the above. claim of immunity qua the records of „Tosha-
Khana‟ from 1990 to 2001 is dismissed, and Government is directed to make 
public the records of „Tosha Khana‟ from the years 1990 to 2001 along the 
source(s) / identity of the providers of gift(s). 
11. 
Equality before the law is the cornerstone of our constitutional polity 
and society, and to achieve it the journey may be arduous, prolonged, and long-
drawn-out but eventual triumph cannot be denied to the robust and resilient 
people of Pakistan. Yes, this journey can be shortened, provided the Government 
/ State guarantees policy of zero tolerance to all forms of inequality, be it social, 
political or economic. 
12. 
This Court is informed that incumbent Government has enforced 
Procedure for the Acceptance and Disposal of Gifts, 2023 and proposed a 
legislation, i.e., Toshakhana (Management and Regulation) Act, 2023. It is for the 
Government to prescribe rules for regulating the matters dealing with the 
acceptance, retention or disposal of gifts. This court is conscious of its 
jurisdiction in terms of Article 199 of the Constitution of Pakistan, which cannot 
be stretched to proceed to legislate, which is the sole domain of the Parliament. 
13.  
These proceedings relating to the issue of disclosure of details of 
„Tosha-Khana‟ are decided and stand concluded in following terms, 
 
i. Ownership of gifts vests in the Government and continues to remain 
so unless procedure prescribed for acceptance and disposal of gifts 
is followed. 
 
 
ii. Failure to disclose / declare the identity of gifts constitutes a 
culpable wrongdoing. 
 

W.P. No.80733/2022 
11
 
iii. Government is directed to disclose the source(s) / identity of the 
providers of gifts from 1990 till 13th of March 2023, within period of 
seven days of the receipt of certified copy of this order. 
 
iv. Government is directed to disclose / public record of Tosha Khana 
from 1990 to 2001, within period of seven days of the receipt of 
certified copy of this order.
