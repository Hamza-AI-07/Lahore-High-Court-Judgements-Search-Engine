Ch. Tariq Latif, Advocate for the petitioner.  
 
 
 
Through this Constitution Petition filed under Article 
199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973, the petitioner has called into question the validity & 
legality of order dated 14.09.2024 passed by the learned 
Appellate Court, pursuant whereto while accepting the 
appeal of respondents No.1 to 5, application filed by the 
petitioner under Order 1 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908 for deletion of the names of respondents 
No.2 & 3 (major sons of the petitioner) from the array of 
plaintiffs,  was dismissed.  
2. 
Facts in brevity are that respondents No.1 to 5 
instituted a suit for recovery of maintenance allowance and 
schooling expenses etc. against the petitioner. Latter 
contested the suit by filing written statement in contrast. 
During the pendency of the suit, the petitioner filed an 
application under Order I Rule 10(2) of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908, by contending therein that since the 
plaintiffs No.2 & 3/respondents No.2 & 3 have attained the 

                                              Writ Petition No. 62571 of 2024.

age of majority, hence, their names be deleted from the 
array of plaintiffs. Learned Trial Court, after taking its reply 
from the other side and providing opportunity of hearing to 
both sides, allowed the application vide order/judgment 
dated 15.12.2023 and strike out the names of respondents 
No.2 & 3 from the array of plaintiffs. Feeling aggrieved, the 
plaintiffs preferred an appeal which was allowed by the 
learned Appellate Court vide impugned judgment dated 
14.09.2024 and consequently dismissed the petitioner‟s 
application. Hence, this writ petition.  
3. 
 Preliminary arguments heard. Record perused.  
4. 
It evinces from the record that through the 
application under Order I Rule 10 C.P.C. the stress of the 
petitioner is that since the respondents No.2 & 3/plaintiffs 
No.2 & 3 have attained the age of majority, hence, as per 
para 370 of the “Principle of Muhammdan Law” by D.F 
Mulla, petitioner is no more bound to maintain them and 
their names be deleted from the array of plaintiffs as they 
are neither proper party nor necessary party. Learned 
counsel for the petitioner while reiterating the stance taken 
in the application has relied upon case laws sited as “Mst. 
Aila Nawaz V. Judge Family Court, Khanewal and 2 others” (2018 
CLC 241) and “Muhammad Riaz ahmad V. Mst. Shaheen Akhtar 
and 3 others.” (PLD 2023 Lahore 317). 
5. 
There is no dispute with regard to the majority of 
respondents No.2 & 3 as the plaintiffs in their suit have 

                                              Writ Petition No. 62571 of 2024.

mentioned their ages at that time as 20 years and 18 years 
respectively. Perusal of the plaint further reflects that 
through the suit respondents/plaintiffs have not only 
claimed the maintenance allowance but also claimed the 
educational, travelling and food expenses.  
6. 
There is no cavil with the proposition that the 
maintenance, in relation to Muslim relatives shall be 
governed and regulated by the principles/injunctions of 
Islam i.e as per the personal law of the parties.  
7. 
The word „maintenance‟ has been defined in Black‟s 
Law  Dictionary (11th Edition) as under:- 
 
“….5.  Financial support given by one person to 
another”. 
 
In Oxford Dictionary it has been defined as under:- 
“The money needed for somebody‟s living 
expenses; the act of providing this money.” 
 
It has been defined in para 369 of the “Principles of 
Muhammdan Law” by D.F. Mulla as  
“369. 
Maintenance 
defined 
____ 
“Maintenance in this chapter includes food, 
raiment and lodging.” 
 
 
8. 
As per para 370 of the Muhammadon Law, a father is 
bound to maintain his children. To his sons until they have 
attained the age of puberty unless they are disabled by 
infirmity or disease, and to his daughters until they are 
married, however,  he is not bound to maintain a child who 

                                              Writ Petition No. 62571 of 2024.

is capable of being maintained out of his or her own 
property. For reference, para 370 is reproduced as under:- 
“370.—(1) A father is bound to maintain his son until 
they have attained the age of puberty. He is also bound 
to maintain his daughters until they are married. But 
he is not bound to maintain his adult sons unless they 
are disabled by infirmity or disease. The fact that the 
children are in the custody of their mother during their 
infancy (S. 352) does not relieve the father from the 
obligation of maintaining them. But the father is not 
bound to maintain a child who is capable of being 
maintained out of his or her own property. 
(2)   If the father is poor and incapable of earning by 
his own labour, the mother, if she is in easy 
circumstances, is bound to maintain her children as 
the father would be. 
(3) 
If the father is poor and infirm, and the mother 
also is poor, the obligation to maintain the children 
lies on the grandfather, provided he is in easy 
circumstances.” 
 
9. 
  Although, according to Section 369 of the 
“Principles of Muhammadan Law” by D.F. Mulla, 
maintenance means and includes food, raiment and lodging 
and as per Section 370 it is described that a father is not 
bound to maintain adult sons unless they are disabled by 
infirmity or disease but Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan 
in a case titled “Alaf Din V. Mst. Parveen Akhtar” (PLD 
1970 SC 75) while elaborating the maintenance of children, 
has held as under:- 
"Normally a child, after attaining majority, would be 
physically in a position to maintain itself, for, it would 
then be capable of earning some kind of a livelihood. 
But this again is a question which will depend upon 
the status and circumstances of each individual family. 
Thus, although the section does not make any 
reference to the age of majority, it is a consideration 
which must inevitably be taken into account by the 
Court when deciding the question as to whether the 
child is or is not able to maintain itself. Thus an infirm 
or decrepit or deformed son or daughter may be 
entitled to claim maintenance even up to a very 
advanced age, while an able-bodied son or daughter 
might be deprived of the right if he/she has already 
found suitable gainful employment and is in a position 
to maintain himself or herself. 

                                              Writ Petition No. 62571 of 2024.

Again in interpreting the word "maintenance" 
some reasonable standard must be adopted. Whilst it 
is not confined merely to food, clothing and lodging, it 
cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be extended to 
incorporate within it education at higher levels ad 
infinitum. What is necessary to decide in this 
connection is to find out as to what amount of 
education has to be attained by the child concerned, 
having regard to the status and other circumstances of 
his family, to enable it to earn a complete livelihood by 
honest and decent means. Thus it may not be sufficient 
to say that the child of a tradesman can maintain itself 
by working as coolly or by thieving. What is required 
is that the child must be maintained until it is in a 
position to earn its own livelihood, in an honest and 
decent manner in keeping with its family status 
(emphasis supplied)" 
 
10. 
     It is not disputed by the respondents‟ side, that 
Abdul Wassey (respondent No.2) who was born on 
16.10.2002 is at the age of 22 and Abdul Raffay (respondent 
No.3) who was born on 04.09.2004 is at the age of 20 and 
they have attained the age of puberty; they are major in 
terms of section 3 of the Majority Act, 1875 read with 
section 4 of the Guardians & Wards Act, 1890 and in any 
case they are an adult and not a minor any more. They are 
not suffering from any disability on account of infirmity or 
disease, therefore, the petitioner being their father in the 
ordinary course is not obliged to maintain them. However, 
some renowned jurist in their exposition on the subject have 
expanded the scope of exception.  
Neil B.E. Baillia in his book/digest Muhammadan 
Law has described as under:- 
„And so also students of learning, when unable to earn 
anything; and their right to maintenance from their 
fathers does not abate while engaged in legal study. 
 
 
 
 
Furthermore 

                                              Writ Petition No. 62571 of 2024.

„when a man is absent, but has left available 
property maintenance may be ordered out of it by the 
judge to the following persons if they are poor; but 
to none other, viz., his parents; his male children if 
young, or, though adult, if unable to gain their 
livelihood. (emphasis supplied) 
 
Ammer Ali (Syed) in his commentaries on 
Mahommedan Law, revised edition by Justice S.H.A. 
Raza has opined as:- 
 
         “Maintenance 
of 
male 
children.—The 
obligation of maintaining the male children lasts until 
they arrive at puberty. After this, a father is not bound 
to maintain his male children, unless they are 
incapacitated from work through some diseases or 
physical infirmity, or are engaged in study. When 
male children are strong enough to earn their own 
livelihood, though nor actually adult, the father may 
set them to work for their own subsistence or hire 
them out for wages. (emphasis supplied) 
 
If the male children are actually able to 
work, but the employment found for them is 
unsuitable or improper for their rank in life, 
they would be placed on the same footing as 
children laboring under some infirmity. Ability 
to work must, in such cases, be considered with 
reference to the social position of the children, 
as well  as the parents; so that a father 
occupying a respectable position,. In which the 
children have been brought up delicately must 
not hire them out for work is degrading in its 
nature or associations.” 
 
In the Principles of Muhammadan Law by Dr. Nishi 
Purohit, it has been provided as— 
 
     “Father‟s obligation of maintenance comes 
to an end when the sons become major. But the 
father is required to maintain his adult son who 
has been disabled on account of some disease, 
or physical or mental infirmity or is engaged in 
study (emphasis supplied).” 
 
It means that the right of maintenance does not limit 
itself only to food, raiment and lodging but also entails all 
other necessary expenses for the mental and physical well 
being of the recipient. 
 

                                              Writ Petition No. 62571 of 2024.

11. 
    The Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, in a case 
titled “Humayun Hassan V. Arslan Humayun and another” 
(PLD 2013 Supreme Court 557) while keeping  in view  
paras No.369 and 370 of the Muhammdan Law and opinion 
of other renowned jurists, has held that in the present days 
social, physical, mental growth, upbringing and well-being 
of the minor, keeping in mind the status of the family, the 
norms of the society and the educational requirement which 
has now attained utmost importance are also liability of the 
father and observed as under: 
“However, it may be observed that from the very 
language of the above section, such definition is 
neither conclusive nor exhaustive, and in our view it 
undoubtedly has a wider connotation and should be 
given an extended meaning, for the purposes of 
meeting and catering for the present days social, 
physical, mental growth, upbringing and well being of 
the minor, keeping in mind the status of the family, the 
norms of the society and his educational requirement, 
which 
has 
now 
attained 
utmost 
importance 
{Ahmedellah V. Mafizuddin and another (AIR 1973 
Gauhati 56)}; but obviously corresponding to and 
commensurating with the means and the capacity of 
the father to pay.”  
 
Further observed as under:- 
“Be that as it may, in view of the preponderance of the 
opinion of the jurists as has been referred to above, it 
emerges that the  obligation of the father to maintain  his 
adult son who has not yet accomplished his basic 
education, enabling him to earn his livelihood, may be  
considered by the court(s) in an appropriate case, a 
factor falling within the exception to the general rule 
(supra). But for that, a specific case has to be initiated 
and set out by the son, before the Court or original 
jurisdiction (competent jurisdiction); and the Court on 
the basis , of the case so propounded; the pleadings of 
the parties after conducting the trial is obliged to 
determine in each case, with reference to the facts of 
that case, whether the adult son should at all be entitled 
to the maintenance, as he still is pursuing his education; 
the Court in this regard shall keep into consideration, 
his age; whether he has his own resource to sustain his 
studies; the nature and the stage of his studies; his 
academic results, his fervor and zeal for the education; 
the extent of education which is essential, enabling him 

                                              Writ Petition No. 62571 of 2024.

to earn the livelihood; obviously, this shall not include 
the higher studies, and in any case not the education 
abroad; especially where the son has gone abroad for 
such education either of his own without there being any 
promise by the father or on the behest of someone else 
who had assured him to support. It may be pertinent to 
mention that while determining and adjudging whether 
the father should provide maintenance to his adult son 
one of the important factors which should be kept in 
view by the Court(s) is whether the son gives due respect 
and show regard to his father, and in any case is not 
disobedient or estranged man. Besides the capacity of 
the father in this behalf should also be kept into view.” 
 
12. 
   It emerges that the obligation of the father to 
maintain his adult son who has not yet accomplished 
basic education, enabling him to earn his livelihood, may 
be considered by the court in an appropriate case, a factor 
falling with the exception to the general rule (supra).  
13.   Education is the necessary qualification which is 
required to a person to enable him to earn bread and 
butter. It does not include higher studies and studies 
abroad. From the analysis of above referred case laws, 
this Court has observed that the learned Trial Court has to 
ascertain in the light of evidence of the parties as to which 
extent the father is bound to pay the educational expenses 
of an adult son. While doing so, following points must be 
taken into account by the learned Trial Court:- 
i) First and the foremost consideration is the capacity 
and financial status of father.  
ii) Age and conduct of the adult son.  
iii) Whether the adult son has his own resources to 
sustain his studies.  
iv) The nature and stage of studies.  
v) Academic performance of adult and his passion & 
zeal towards the education 

                                              Writ Petition No. 62571 of 2024.

vi) The extent of education which is essential to enable 
him to earn his livelihood. Obviously, this shall not 
include the higher studies, especially studies 
abroad without there being a promise by the father 
to support him. 
vii) Whether the son gives due respect and show regard 
to his father and in any case is not disobedient or 
estranged man.  
14. 
     It shall also be determined by the learned Trial 
Court after recording evidence of the parties and 
analyzing status of the father as to whether the adult sons 
are entitled to receive maintenance allowance or not.  
15.      No doubt the court may at any stage of the 
proceedings, either upon or without the application of either 
party, and on such terms as may appear to the court be just, 
order that the name of any party improperly joined, whether 
as plaintiff or defendant, be struck out. The party who has 
no connection with the relief sought may be struck off from 
the record as a party. The court can also strike out a party 
over whom it has no jurisdiction. Whether a party is to be 
struck out or not is to be determined on the basis of plaint as 
framed. The word „Party‟ has been defined in West Pakistan 
Family Courts Act, 1964  as under:- 
Section 2 (d)   
“Party” shall include any person whose presence as 
such is considered necessary for a proper decision of 
the dispute and whom the Family Court adds as a 
party to such dispute.” 
 
          The Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case 
titled Muhammad Arif and others Vs District & Sessions Judge, 
Sialkot and others (2011 SCMR 1591) defined it as under:- 

                                              Writ Petition No. 62571 of 2024. 
 10 
“5……This definition has two parts which for 
convenience are serialized (a) and (b):- 
 
(a)  Any person whose presence as such is considered 
necessary for the proper decision of the dispute. 
 
(b) Any person who the Family Court adds as a party to 
such dispute. 
 
 
6.    The nature of family dispute and jurisdiction of 
the family court is special as well as peculiar. The 
West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 was therefore, 
legislated “to make provision for the establishment of 
Family Courts for the expeditious settlement and 
dispose of the disputes relating to marriage and family 
affairs and for matters connected therewith”. It was in 
this perspective that the definition of the term „Party‟ 
was specifically codified in section 2(d)in this Act. 
This definition is though not very different from the 
one obtaining under C.P.C. yet it is comparatively 
more liberal and extensive than the proverbial 
„necessary or property party‟ of a civil suit.” 
 
16. 
    In view of above discussion it is observed that 
respondents No.2 & 3 are proper and  necessary party and 
their presence is necessary for the proper decision of the 
controversy involved in the respondents‟ suit.  
17. 
For the foregoing reasons, learned Appellate Court 
has rightly allowed appeal of the respondents. Learned 
counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner remained 
unable to point out any illegality, irregularity or 
jurisdictional defect in the impugned order. Impugned order 
is well-reasoned and passed after due appreciation of the 
record as well as merits of the case which is not open to any 
exception or interference by this Court while exercising 
constitutional jurisdiction. The case laws referred to by the 
learned counsel for the petitioner are not relevant to the 
facts and circumstances of this case, therefore, not helpful 
for the petitioner. 

                                              Writ Petition No. 62571 of 2024.

18. 
The epitome of above discussion is that instant 
petition is meritless, hence, the same is dismissed-in-limine.
