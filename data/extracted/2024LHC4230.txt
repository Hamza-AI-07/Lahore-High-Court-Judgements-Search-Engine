AALIA NEELUM, C.J:- The appellant-Qaisar Abbas, son of 
Riaz Ahmad, Caste Jatt Warraich, resident of Saroki, Tehsil and District 
Gujrat, has assailed his conviction and sentence recorded by the learned 
Addl. Sessions Judge, Gujrat vide judgment dated 14.11.2018, in a State

2. 
 
Feeling aggrieved by the judgment of the learned trial court, the 
appellant-Qaisar Abbas, has assailed his conviction and sentence by filing an 
appeal bearing Crl. Appeal No.250896 of 2018. The learned trial court also 
referred M.R. No.371 of 2018 (The State. Vs. Qaisar Abbas) to confirm 

M.R No.371 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.250896 of 2018

the death sentence awarded to the appellant-Qaisar Abbas, as both the 
matters arising from the same judgment of the learned trial court are being 
disposed of through this consolidated judgment. 
3. 
 
Briefly, the prosecution story as alleged in the F.I.R (Ex. PA) 
lodged on the statement (Ex. PP) of Khurram Shahzad, deceased 
(complainant) is that Khurram Shahzad, deceased (complainant), along with 
his brother, Naveed had come to the house of their sister namely, Mst. Salma 
Bibi, the wife of Ansar Ali, Caste Jatt Warraich, and a resident of village 
Sarokey, wanted to see their sister. On the night of 25/26.08.2015, at about 
11:00 p.m., the complainant (since dead) was talking with his friend, Qaisar 
Abbas, the accused, and hot words were exchanged between them; after that, 
the accused, Qaisar Abbas, took away a pistol from his “dab” and stated to 
the complainant (since dead) that he would not let him alive. On hue and cry 
of the complainant (since dead), his brother, namely Naveed, and his sister, 
Salma, reached there. Qaisar Abbas, the accused fired straight at the 
complainant, hitting him on the right side of his chest, and the complainant 
(since dead) fell, and after that, the accused fled away. After that, the 
complainant (since dead) was brought to A.B.S hospital, Gujrat, in an 
injured condition; then he was shifted to Mayo Hospital, Lahore, where he 
(the complainant, since dead) succumbed to the injury and offence under 
Section 324 PPC, was substituted with an offence under Section 302 PPC.  
4. 
 
After recording the statement (Ex. PP) of the complainant 
(since dead), a formal FIR (Ex. PA) was chalked out by Muhammad Qasim, 
T/ASI (PW-1).  After the registration of the case, the investigation of this 
case was first entrusted to Faique Abbaqs, S.I (PW-5). After that, the 
investigation of this case was entrusted to Faiz Ahmad, S.I. (PW-12), who 
found the accused/appellant guilty, prepared a report under Section 173, 
Cr.P.C. while placing the names of the accused in column No.3 of the 
Challan and sent the same to the court of competent jurisdiction. The learned 
trial court formally charge-sheeted the appellant on 04.02.2016, to which he 
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In support of its version, the 
prosecution produced as many as twelve (12) witnesses. The appellant was 

M.R No.371 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.250896 of 2018 
 
 
3
also examined in terms of Section 342 Cr.P.C., wherein he neither opted to 
appear as his own witness in terms of Section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor produced 
any defence evidence. In response to a particular question of why this case 
was against him and why the PWs deposed against him, the appellant made 
the following deposition: - 
“The story of prosecution is totally false and fabricated 
one. It was a night occurrence, in fact, deceased of instant 
case was drunk when he left the house of his sister Salma 
Bibi and was armed with pistol. He entered in the house of 
a neighbourer at late night for his nefarious and ferocious 
designs, due to which, he received injury by any unknown 
person when he was all alone. This fact is further 
supported 
from 
Medicolegal 
certificate 
of 
then 
injured/deceased, Khurram Shahzad. Doctor recorded the 
statement of Salma Bibi which fortified the above 
mentioned fact regarding leaving the house in drunk and 
receiving firearm injury. The PWs are closely related with 
the deceased. I have been falsely implicated just to usurp 
my landed property. FIR was delayed one which was 
registered with premeditation and pre consultation with 
the connivance of the doctor and police. Then injured was 
not fit for statement but with malafide intention and 
connivance of Faiq Abbas, S.I and doctor his statement 
was posed to be recorded by then injured which is totally 
wrong just to strengthen the false version of the 
prosecution;. No person of locality i.e. village of 
occurrence endorsed the false version of prosecution. So 
much so, the brother of deceased Rana Muhammad Saeed 
and mother Zohra Bibi have not endorsed the version of 
Salma Bibi and others. I am innocent. I have been falsely 
implicated and have no concerned with the occurrence.”  
5. 
 
After recording evidence and evaluating the evidence available 
on record, considering arguments advanced from both sides, the learned trial 
court found the prosecution version proved beyond any shadow of 
reasonable doubt, which resulted in the appellant’s conviction as well as 
awarding of sentence to him in the afore-stated terms. 
6. 
 
We have heard the arguments advanced by the learned counsel 
for the parties and have minutely perused the record on the file. 
7. 
 
The occurrence occurred on the intervening night of 25.08.2015 
and 26.08.2015 at 11:00 p.m. in Saroki, situated within the jurisdiction of 

M.R No.371 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.250896 of 2018

Police Station Kunjah, District Gujrat, which is 3-1/2 kilometers only from 
the place of occurrence. Whereas F.I.R. (Ex. PA) was registered on 
26.08.2015 at 04:30 a.m., on the verbal statement-Fard bayan of Khurram 
Shahzad, then injured, at ABS Hospital, Gujrat, on which F.I.R. (Ex. PA) 
was registered under section 324 PPC. After that, Khurram Shahzad 
succumbed to the injuries at Mayo Hospital, Lahore, on 27.08.2015 at 06:05 
a.m., and an offence under Section 302 PPC was substituted. It was argued 
by learned D.P.G. that the F.I.R. of the incident was lodged under section 
324 P.P.C. on the intervening night of 25.08.2015 and 26.08.2015 at 4:30 
a.m. The deceased, Khurram Shahzad, soon after the incident, was taken to 
ABS Hospital, Gujrat, where he was given medical treatment by Dr. Iqbal 
Hussain (PW-6) on 26-08-2015 in the night. His dying declaration was also 
recorded by Faique Abbas S.I. (PW-5), and the signature of Dr. Iqbal 
Hussain (PW-6) has been marked as (Ex.P.E/2) in which he categorically 
stated that accused Qaiser Abbas had shot him with pistol 30 bore and his 
sister Salma Bibi (PW-7) and brother Naveed (PW-11) brought him to the 
hospital. Faique Abbas S.I. (PW-5) deposed during the examination-in-chief 
that: - 
“---On 26.08.2015, I was posted as ASI of police station 
Kunjah. On receiving information that one person has 
sustained a firearm injury and has been removed to ABS 
Hospital Gujrat, I promptly reached in hospital, made an 
application Ex.P.E to medical officer for recording 
statement of injured Khuram Shahzad s/o Abdul Khaliq. 
My signatures over Ex.P.E is Ex.P.E/1, prepared injury 
statement Ex.P.F which bears my signatures Ex.P.F/1---
On 26.08.2015, I recorded the statement of Khuram 
Shahzad (deceased) at ABS Hospital, Gujrat, which is 
Exh.P.P which bears signatures and thumb impression of 
Khuram Shahzad. I identified the signatures and thumb 
impression of Khuram Shahzad. His signatures and 
thumb impression is Exh.P.P/1 abd Exh,.P.P/2” 
Faique Abbas S.I. (PW-5) deposed during the cross-examination that: - 
“---I do not conversant with Khuram Shahzad prior to 
allegedly recording his statement. I have not seen any I.D 
card of Khuram Shahzad. I have not got attested the 
alleged statement of Khuram Shahzad by any doctor. I 
have also not annexed any video clip along with the alleged 
statement of Khuram Shahzad---” 

M.R No.371 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.250896 of 2018

Dr. Iqbal Hussain (PW-6) deposed during the examination-in-chief that: - 
“---Faique Abbas ASI also moved an application Ex.P.E 
for recording the statement of the injured. I examined 
the patient. Patient is well oriented and fit for statement. 
Application for recording statement of injured bears my 
signatures 
Ex.P.E/2. 
After 
conducting 
medical 
examination I issued MLC Ex.P.I which bears my 
signatures Ex.P.1/1”. 
The testimony of Faique Abbas S.I. (PW-5), Dr. Iqbal Hussain (PW-6), and 
Naveed (PW-11) was belied by medical as well as documentary evidence. 
On perusing the medical examination certificate (Ex. PI/1), we found that 
Khurram Shahzad (then injured) was brought to the hospital by Javeed Iqbal 
4007/C (PW-4) at 1:40 a.m., and immediately, medical treatment was 
provided. The column “General Physical Examination/Symptoms” mentions 
that “Semi-conscious BP 90/60 Plus 97/min,” and medical treatment was 
provided against police docket No. 38. Dr. Iqbal Hussain (PW-6) deposed 
during the cross-examination that: - 
“---It is correct that whenever any injured is brought to 
hospital and if he is in his senses, we record his statement 
in brief history otherwise statement of any person 
accompanied by said injured is recorded. It is correct 
that in MLR of the injured Khuram Shahzad statement 
of his sister Mst. Salma Bibi has been recorded----It is 
correct that I recorded the statement of the sister of 
injured Khuram Shahzad because of the fact that 
injured was not in a fit condition to give his statement” 
In the column concerning “brief history,” it was noted that the statement of 
Salma Bibi (PW-7), the sister of Khurram Shahzad, was recorded, which is 
reproduced as under: - 
"
 مضروب کی بہن کے بیان کے مطابق مضروب نے شراب پی ہوئی تھی اور
گھر سے پستول لے کر نکال پڑوسی کے گھر گیا اور لڑائی ہوئی فائر لگا"
 
Javed Iqbal 4007/C (PW-4) has not deposed that he accompanied the injured 
for medical examination to ABS Hospital, Gujrat; rather, he stated that after 
the medical examination, he produced MLC (Ex. PI/1) of the injured 
Khurram Shahzad before the investigating officer. Faique Abbas S.I. (PW-5) 
deposed during the cross-examination that: - 
“---The information of the alleged occurrence was received 
at Kunjah on the mid night of 26/27.05, again stated 08th 

M.R No.371 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.250896 of 2018

month of 2015 at about 11/12’o clock through mobile 
phone---I did not enter in the relevant about the person 
through whom I received the information—The person who 
gave telephonic information did not mention the name of 
any accused and manner of occurrence. I did not mention 
about the receipt of alleged occurrence in the relevant 
register---On injury statement, the factum of being injured 
was told by some person, again stated that it was told by the 
concerned injured---Rupt No.38 dated 26.08.015 is not 
attached with the record---It is correct that the F.I.R of 
alleged occurrence was registered with the delay of about 
five to six hours---” 
On perusal of the injury statement (Ex. PF) (available on page No. 125-A of 
the paper book), it reveals that the same was prepared at police station 
Kunjah, District Gujrat, and the injured was referred to hospital through 
Javeed Iqbal 4007/C (PW-4). The scanned copy of the injury statement is 
reproduced as follows: -

Faique Abbas, S.I (PW-5)-the investigating officer deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“---It is correct that as per column No.1 of inquest report 
Ex.P.L, the dead body of deceased Khuram Shahzad was 
recovered from village Sarookey---” 
The dying declaration (Ex-PP) contains the signatures of Dr. Iqbal Hussain 
(PW-6), but this witness admitted during the cross-examination that 
Khurram Shahzad was in a Semi-conscious condition and not fit to make a 
statement. Dr. Iqbal's admission is very material and creates doubt about the 
truthfulness of the dying declaration. These circumstances show that there 
was no occasion to record the dying declaration, which demolishes the 
whole story of the dying declaration. The time of the dying declaration and 
the medico-legal examination are relevant facts. Under Article 46 of the 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, the sanctity of a dying declaration must be 
evaluated with great care and caution, and the evidence of a dying 
declaration must be appreciated with due diligence. A dying declaration is a 
question of fact that has to be determined by the facts of each case. A case 
must be considered in all its physical environment and circumstances to 
discover the truth or falsity of a dying declaration. The courts below have to 
be extremely careful when they deal with a dying declaration, as the maker 
is not available for cross-examination, which poses great difficulty to the 
accused person. A mechanical approach of relying upon a dying declaration 
just because it is there is extremely dangerous. The courts insist that the 
dying declaration should be of such nature as to inspire the full confidence 
of the court in its truthfulness and correctness. The court, however, has 
always to be on guard to see that the statement of the deceased was not a 
result of either tutoring or prompting or a product of imagination. The court 
also must further decide that the deceased was in a fit state of mind and had 
the opportunity to observe and identify the assailant. Usually, therefore, the 
court looks up to the medical opinion to satisfy whether the deceased was in 
a fit mental condition to make the dying declaration. Dr. Iqbal Hussain (PW-
6) mentioned in MLC (Ex. PI/1) that the time of the medico-legal 
examination is 1:40 a.m. on 26.08.2015, after two hours and forty minutes 
and Faique Abbas S.I. (PW-5) recorded verbal statement-Fard bayan (Ex. 

M.R No.371 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.250896 of 2018

PP) of Khurram Shahzad, then injured, at ABS Hospital, Gujrat, at 04:30 
a.m. on 26.08.2015. As soon as the injured is brought, the doctor takes 
automatic steps for first aid, and since the doctor sent Khurram Shahzad, 
who was then injured, for a chest x-ray, the radiologist and surgeon's 
opinion. Dr. Iqbal Hussain (PW-6) deposed during the cross-examination 
that: - 
“---It is correct that I advised for x-ray and opinion of 
radiologist and surgeon. It is correct that opinion of 
Surgeon and radiologist is not part of MLR” 
Dr. Muhammad Ali (PW-10), who conducted a postmortem on the dead 
body of Khurram Shahzad, observed that the drain tube incision and stitch 
wound on the right iliac fossa oblique measuring 5x1 cm marks were 
present. It suggests that Khurram Shahzad went through the surgical process. 
When the doctor referred the injured (Khurram Shahzad) for a surgeon’s 
opinion, and provided medical treatment, it can not be said that he was in a 
condition to give a statement. In the inquest report (Ex.PL), in the column of 
brief history, it is mentioned that the injured Khurram Shahzad was referred 
to Mayo Hospital from ABS Hospital. Saqib Nazir 378/C (PW-3) deposed 
during his examination-in-chief that he escorted the dead body of Khurram 
Shahzad to A.B.S. Hospital, Gujrat. Still, he had not deposed wherefrom he 
escorted the dead body of Khurram Shahzad to A.B.S. Hospital, Gujrat.  In 
the column of brief history of inquest report (Ex. PL), it was mentioned as 
under: - 
 

M.R No.371 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.250896 of 2018

Immediately after providing first aid, Dr. Iqbal Hussain (PW-6) must have 
conducted a medico-legal examination, first. The time is 1:40 a.m. on 
26.08.2015, written on the MLC (Ex. PI/1). After that, the injured was sent 
for surgery, and the prosecution did not produce the surgical unit/department 
record. The prosecution failed to establish where Khurram Shahzad took his 
last breath. So, the time of writing the dying declaration is wrong. It appears 
that the dying declaration was recorded much later, and the doctor concerned 
unmindfully mentioned that the injured was fit to make a statement on the 
application for recording the statement of the injured (Ex. PD). Why he 
(PW-5) has not written said fact on the dying declaration, is surprising and 
raising eyebrows. The dying declaration and injury report were recorded at 
the same time. Due to the nature of the injury and abnormal pulse rate, a 
semi-conscious injured person is not expected to be able to depose the 
dying declaration. Thus, the dying declaration appears to be highly 
doubtful. However, during cross-examination, he admitted that the sister's 
statement of the injured Khurram Shahzad was recorded because the injured 
Khurram Shahzad was not in a fit condition to give his statement. Thus, the 
conduct of the medical officer concerned is highly questionable. The 
prosecution witnesses have not deposed that Khurram Shehzad was shifted 
to Mayo Hospital Lahore for medical treatment, when and who took/shifted 
him to Mayo Hospital Lahore. Dr. Iqbal Hussain (PW-6) also did not depose 
in his examination-in-chief that he referred Khurram Shehzad to Mayo 
Hospital Lahore for medical treatment.  It is also not mentioned in the MLC 
(Ex. PI/1) that Khuram Shehzad was referred injured to Mayo Hospital 
Lahore for medical management. Salma BiBi (PW-7) and Naveed (PW-11), 
sister and brother of Khurram Shahzad, also did not depose in their 
examination-in-chief that they shifted the injured to Mayo Hospital Lahore 
for medical treatment where he lost his life. During cross-examination, 
Salma BiBi (PW-7) deposed that she remained for about two and a half 
hours in the hospital, the time so becomes about 1:40 a.m. on 26.08.2015. 
What happened from 1:40 a.m. on 26.08.2015 till 06:05 a.m., on 27.08.2015 
i.e. the time when Khurram Shahzad expired, which is the time and date 
mentioned by Dr. Muhammad Ali (PW-10), on the post-mortem 

M.R No.371 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.250896 of 2018 
 
 
10
examination report, the prosecution story is silent. A similar statement is 
given by Naveed (PW-11); apart from this, the prosecution story is silent as 
to when Khurram Shahzad breathed his last and who brought his dead body 
to ABS Hospital Gujarat. Faique Abbas, S.I./I.O. (PW-5) does not depose in 
his statement that he brought the dead body of Khurram Shahzad to ABS 
Hospital Gujarat from Mayo Hospital, Lahore, while Faiz Ahmed S.I./I.O. 
(PW-12) mentioned in the column of the brief history of inquest report (Ex. 
PL) that Faique Abbas, S.I./I.O. (PW-5) brought the dead body of Khurram 
Shahzad from Mayo Hospital Lahore to  A.B.S. Hospital, Gujrat.  
8.  
 
In the FIR (Ex. PA), there is a mention that on the hue and cry 
of the complainant, Khurram Shahzad (since dead), his brother, namely 
Naveed, and his sister, Salma Bibi, reached the place of occurrence. Qaisar 
Abbas fired straight at the complainant, hitting him on the right side of his 
chest. The names of the witnesses were mentioned in the FIR (Ex. PA). 
Salma Bibi (PW-7) deposed during the cross-examination that: - 
“---It is correct that I got recorded in my statement 
before the police that I was sitting inside the house 
whereas accused Qaiser Abbas and deceased Khuram 
Shahzad were sitting outside the house. I got recorded in 
my statement before police that after hearing noise I 
went out the house---I did not get record in my statement 
before the police that any altercation was happened in 
between my brother Khuram Shahzad and accused 
Qaiser Abbas within the area of Sarokey. I got recorded 
in my statement in the court that deceased Khuram 
Shahzad and accused Qaiser Abbas were sitting in the 
haveli---it is correct that there is small path and a “Nala” 
in front of our house. Door of our house opens in the 
street. It is correct that no witness from the surrounding 
houses is in this case. My brother Naveed PW arrived in 
the village one day prior to the occurrence---I do not 
know that normally there is tradition in the villages that 
people sleep after offering Esha prayer. I do not know 
that whether deceased Khuram Shahzad and accused 
Qaiser Abbas were sitting on the ground, or on the cots 
or on the chairs. I do not know how much time it will 
take of the journey from our village to the hospital. I do 
not know the distance in between police station Kunjah 
and our village---” 
Naveed (PW-11) deposed during the cross-examination that: -

“—I and Khuram Shahzad came from Lahore to 
Sarookey on the same day i.e. on 25.08.2015. Occurrence 
was happened on 26.08.2015---The injured was shifted to 
Hospital by “1122”. I off and on visit the house of my 
sister Salma Bibi---I do not know that whether accusing 
Qaiser Abbas and deceased were sitting on the ground, 
on cots or on the chairs---” 
The dying declaration (Ex. PP) of Khurram Shahzad reveals that he went to 
the Haveli of Qaiser Abbas, the accused, where the incident took place. In 
the dying declaration (Ex. PP) of Khurram Shahzad, it was mentioned as 
under: -

The presence of the witnesses at the Haveli at about 11:00 P.M. and near the 
place of occurrence is highly improbable. Faique Abbas S.I. (PW-5) deposed 
during the cross-examination that: - 
“---It is correct that information about alleged 
occurrence was not given by Salma Bibi and Naveed 
PWs of the instant case. It is correct that any figure of 
concerned locality did not support the version of 
prosecution’s case. The information of the alleged 
occurrence was received at Kunjah on the mid night of 
26/27.05, again stated 08th month of 2015at about 11/12’o 
clock through mobile phone---I did not enter in the 
relevant about the person through whom I received the 
information---The 
person 
who 
gave 
telephonic 
information did not mention the name of any accused 
and manner of occurrence. I did not mention about the 
receipt of alleged occurrence in the relevant register. On 
injury statement, the factum of being injured was told by 
some person, again stated that it was told by the 
concerned injured---It is correct that I went through the 
medical certificate of then injured and perused the same 

M.R No.371 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.250896 of 2018

kept in the case file. It is correct that as per Exh.P.I, as 
per statement of sister of injured, injured had drunk and 
he came out of his taking pistol with him, entered into 
the house of neighbour, quarrel took place and fire hit. It 
is correct that as per Exh.P.I, the medical certificate of 
then injured, sister of injured did not nominate accused 
Qaiser Abbas present in the court. When I prepared 
sketch of injuries Exh.P.G, no person was present. It is 
correct that on Exh.P.G the name of any accused could 
not mention. Rupt No.38 dated 26.08.2015 is not attached 
with the record---It is correct that medical of injured was 
conducted through police. As per Exh.P.G, according to 
the sister of then injured Salma Bibi has not deposed 
that she herself witnessed the occurrence nor Naveed 
PW witnessed the occurrence. It is correct that when I 
saw the then injured, he was wearing only “pent”. No 
mobile, perse or any other articles of the then injured 
was not taken into possession by me. It is correct that 
besides the house of accused Qaiser, no Haveli of said 
accused was situated there. It is correct that as per 
statements of Salma PW and Naveed PW dated 
26.08.2015, the alleged occurrence took place in the 
Haveli of Qaiser accused. It is correct that in the house of 
Qaiser accused shown in site plan Exh.P.F, the alleged 
occurrence or the collection of bloodstained was not 
found proved. It is correct that whatever was pointed by 
the PWs, I prepared the site plan, Exh.P.F, accordingly. 
It is correct that I did not show the residence of sister of 
the then injured or PWs near or around the haveli of 
Muhammad Aslam s/o Nazar Muhammad or the house 
of Qaiser accused in Exh.P.F. The house of complainant 
party was situated with the gape of three to four houses 
from the house of Qaiser accused shown in Exh.P.F---It 
is correct that the F.I.R of alleged occurrence was 
registered with the delay of about five to six hours---”  
Faiz Ahmad S.I./I.O. (PW-12)-investigating officer deposed during cross-
examination that:  
“---It is correct that when the investigation of the instant 
case was entrusted to me I went through whole of the 
record. As per statement of PW Salma Bibi mentioned 
on Exh.P.I, Khuram Shahzad, the then injured was 
drunk when he went out from his house while taking 
pistol with him and he went to the house of neighbourer 
and where fight took place and fire was hit. It is correct 
that in said statement of PW-7 Salma Bibi there is no 
mentioned of accused who made fire shot. It is correct 
that as per column No.1 of inquest report Ex.P.L, the 
dead body of deceased Khuram Shahzad was recovered

from village Sarookey. It is correct that on 27.08.2015 
one Rana Muhammad Usman joined investigation. Said 
Rana Muhammad Usman was the relative of deceased 
Khurram Shahzad as well as PWs Salma Bibi and 
Naveed. It is correct that said PW Rana Muhammad 
Usman did not support the statements of PWs Naveed 
and Salma Bibi. PW Naveed is the real brother of 
deceased Khuram Shahzad---” 
It is the prosecution's case that the incident took place in the house of Qaiser 
Abbas, the accused, and on the pointing of Salma Bibi (PW-7) and Naveed 
(PW-11), the unscaled site plan (Ex. PN) was prepared by Faiz Ahmad 
S.I./I.O. (PW-12)-investigating officer. Faiz Ahmad S.I./I.O. (PW-12)-
investigating officer deposed during examination-in-chief that: - 
“---On 29.08.2015, I summoned the brother of the 
complainant Naveed and Muhammad Asif Akhtar 
Naqash draftsman and took rough notes from the place 
of occurrence. Draftsman prepared scaled site plan and 
handed over to me three leaves Exh.P.B/1-3. I made red 
notes upon Exh.P.B. My red notes are Exh.P.B/4-6. I 
recorded the statement of draftsman u/s 161 Cr.P.C---” 
Faiz Ahmad S.I./I.O. (PW-12)-investigating officer deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“—It is correct that I got prepared site plan Exh.P.B on 
the pointation of PWs Salma Bibi and Naveed which I 
signed on 03.09.2015. It is correct that as per site plan 
Exh.P.B, the occurrence took place in the Havaili of 
Muhammad Aslam s/o Nazar Muhammad. It is correct 
that as per my investigation occurrence took place in the 
house of above said Muhammad Aslam. It is correct that 
during my investigation, occurrence did not take place in 
the house/Havaili of Qaiser Abbas accused. It is correct 
that on the pointation of PWs Salma and Naveed, site 
plan Exh.P.B was prepared and the place of occurrence 
was found the house of above said Muhammad Aslam. It 
is correct that aforementioned Muhammad Aslam did 
not join investigation in support of the version of the 
complainant party. It is correct that said Muhammad 
Aslam is not the witness of said case---It is correct that 
the aforementioned Haveli/house, was consisted on four 
boundaries, having an iron gate. It is correct that I did 
not show the house of PWs Salma Bibi and Naveed, 
situated around the place of occurrence---it is correct 
that accused Qaiser had independent house in village 
Sarokey. Nothing was recovered from the house of 
accused Qaiser---”.  

M.R No.371 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.250896 of 2018

Salma Bibi (PW-7) deposed during the cross-examination that: - 
“---It is correct that there is small path and a “Nala” in 
front of our house. Door of our house opens in the street. 
It is correct that no witness from the surrounding houses 
is in this case. My brother Naveed PW arrived in the 
village one day prior to the occurrence---I do not know 
that normally there is tradition in the villages that people 
sleep after offering Esha prayer. I do not know that 
whether deceased Khuram Shahzad and accused Qaiser 
Abbas were sitting on the ground, or on the cots or on 
the chairs. I do not know how much time it will take of 
the journey from our village to the hospital. I do not 
know the distance in between police station Kunjah and 
our village---” 
Naveed (PW-11) deposed during the cross-examination that: - 
“---It is correct that adjacent to the house of my sister 
Salma Bibi there is a path and a “Nala” (drainage) in 
front of her house. The door of the house of Salma Bibi 
opens towards passage. There are two doors of the house 
of my sister Salma Bibi and both doors open on the side 
of said path---We pointed the place of occurrence to I.O 
as well as the point where we were sitting---” 
The prosecution also has not proved the place of occurrence. Faiz Ahmad 
S.I./I.O. (PW-12)-investigating officer deposed during cross-examination 
that: - 
“---It is correct that I got prepared site plan Exh.P.B on 
the pointation of PWs Salma Bibi and Naveed which I 
signed on 03.09.2015. It is correct that as per site plan 
Exh.P.B, the occurrence took place in the Havaili of 
Muhammad Aslam s/o Nazar Muhammad---It is correct 
that during my investigation, occurrence did not take 
place in the house/hevaili of Qaiser Abbas accused---” 
The actual place of occurrence has not been duly proved. As regards the 
place of occurrence, Faiz Ahmad S.I./I.O. (PW-12)-the investigating officer, 
has stated that the place of occurrence is not the Haveli of Qaiser Abbas, and 
the same is the Haveli of Muhammad Aslam, son of Nazar Muhammad. 
Besides being highly interested, all the prosecution witnesses have also 
made irreconcilable contradictions on material points, rendering their 
evidence incredible. With this background, the presence of the alleged eye-
witnesses on the spot seems doubtful. This is a very serious infirmity that 
destroys the credibility of the witnesses' evidence. If the evidence of these

Crl. Appeal No.250896 of 2018 
 
 
15
witnesses is rejected as untrustworthy, nothing survives the prosecution case, 
and it would not be safe to rely upon such evidence.  
9.  
 
The motive set up by the prosecution in the Fard Bayyan (Ex. 
PP) and F.I.R. (Ex.PA) and deposed about it by Salma Bibi (PW-7) and 
Naveed (PW-11) have been found by us to have remained un-proved. The 
prosecution case in this regard was vague and could hardly inspire 
confidence. Salma Bibi (PW-7) deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“---I did not get record in my statement before the police 
that any altercation was happened in between my 
brother Khuram Shahzad and accused Qaiser Abbas 
within the area of Sarokey---” 
10.  
 
Therefore, the evidence led by the prosecution in connection 
with motive is not sufficient for placing reliance on the testimonies of the 
witnesses for committing the occurrence. Motive is a double-edged weapon 
for the occurrence and for false implications. There are always different 
motives that operate in the mind of the person in making false accusation. In 
the circumstances, we cannot avoid the conclusion that the motive, as 
alleged, was an afterthought and has not been proved by any credible 
evidence. 
11.  
 
We have noticed that no doubt 30-bore pistol (P-4) along with 
two live bullets (P-4/1-2) was allegedly recovered on the pointing of Qaiser 
Abbas, appellant-accused and there is no report of the Forensic Science 
Laboratory, Lahore, that the weapon had matched with the crime empties. 
As no crime was empty was recovered from the place of occurrence which 
could be matched with the weapon recovered.  Contrary to it, the report of 
Forensic Science Laboratory (Ex. PS) reflects that the allegedly recovered 
weapon was in working condition, therefore, there is no incriminating 
recovery in this case available on record to connect the appellant with the 
commission of offence.  
12.  
 
In view of the above circumstances, the conclusion we arrived 
at is that there is no credible evidence to establish that Salma Bibi (PW-7) 
and Naveed (PW-11), eyewitnesses, have brought true facts before the court. 
The 
prosecution 
had 
badly 
failed 
to 
lead 
incriminating,

Crl. Appeal No.250896 of 2018 
 
 
16
corroborative/independent evidence to bring home guilt of the accused. In 
this background, the benefit of doubt is to be extended in favour of the 
accused.  In the case of Muhammad Akram v. The State  (2009 SCMR 
230), wherein it has been held as under:-    
“----Benefit of doubt---Principles---For given the benefit 
of doubt it is not necessary that there should be many 
circumstances creating doubts---Single circumstance 
creating reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the 
guilt of accused makes him entitled to its benefit, not as a 
matter of grace and concession, but as a matter of right.”    
13.  
 
The upshot of the above discussion is that the prosecution has 
badly failed to bring home charge against the appellant beyond any 
reasonable doubt, therefore, in the interest of safe administration of criminal 
justice, Crl. Appeal No.250896 of 2018, filed by the appellant, Qaisar 
Abbas is accepted in toto.  The conviction and sentence awarded by the 
learned Additional Sessions Judge, Gujrat vide judgment dated 14.11.2018, 
is set aside and the appellant, is acquitted of the charge in a case F.I.R 
No.593/2015, dated 26.08.2015, offence under Section 302 PPC, registered 
at the police station, Kunjah, District Gujrat. The appellant, Qaisar Abbas 
son of Riaz Ahmad, who is in custody, is ordered to be released forthwith, if 
not required in any other case.   
14.  
 
Murder Reference No.371 of 2018, forwarded by the learned 
trial court for confirmation of sentence of death inflicted upon the convict 
fails, which is answered in NEGNATIVE.
