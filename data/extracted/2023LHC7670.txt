     SULTAN TANVIR AHMAD, J:–Through 
the present Constitution petition, the petitioner has 
assailed the auction of certain blocks of sand in Lahore 
by Mines and Mineral Department, Punjab (MMD), inter 
alia, on the ground that the auction is taking place 
without obtaining requisite approval from Environment

Protection Agency (EPA). 
2.   
Ch. Imran Raza Chadhar, learned counsel for 
the petitioner has submitted that petitioner is interested to 
participate in forthcoming auction of sand blocks in 
Lahore and obtain lease but the failure on the part of 
MMD to obtain no objection certificate (NOC) prior to 
auction is likely to cause loss to the petitioner, if he 
remains successful in obtaining lease of sand blocks, as 
after the commencement of lease the period consumed in 
obtaining NOC shall be at the cost of the petitioner. The 
learned counsel for the petitioner has further argued that 
auction of sand zones namely Muridwal / Niaz Beg Zone, 
Bhadru / Chamrupur Zone and Nonarian Block 
(hereinafter collectively called as the „Sand Blocks‟) is in 
contravention of the decision dated 02.04.2019 passed by 
this Court in constitution petition titled “Ch. Ghulam 
Rasool versus Province of Punjab, etc.” bearing No. 
9428 of 2019 as well as undertaking of MMD before this 
Court in the said case. 
3.    
Conversely, the learned Law Officer and the 
representatives of MMD as well as EPA have vehemently 
opposed this petition. It is argued that petition has been 
filed just to stop the auction process and to retain the 
possession to the extent of the zone(s) that the petitioner 
obtained through earlier auction. It is contended that 
during pendency of this petition this Court refused to stop 
the process of auction as an interim measure and the 
petitioner without disclosing this fact filed a civil suit and 
obtained injunctive order from learned civil Court, which 
resulted into halting auction process of Bhadru / 
Chamrupur Zone and this has been done with the view to 

 
Writ Petition No. 23394-2023                         
 
3 
continue his possession against lease consideration for 
previous auction i.e. 2021, just for his personal gain and 
at cost of Public Exchequer; that if the auction process of 
mines and minerals lease is stopped it can cause loss of 
Rs. 10.5 billion estimated just on the basis of reserved 
prices, however, bids of much higher amounts, letters of 
intent and offer are being received and if the same are 
considered, the loss shall be far greater. Learned Law 
Officer has also raised serious objections as to the 
conduct of the petitioner.  
4.   
The question of shifting responsibility by 
MMD to the contractors and / or the successful bidders to 
obtain NOC from EPA has earlier came before this Court 
in case titled Ch. Ghulam Rasool (supra) and in 
consequence of meeting held on 01.03.2019 by the 
concerned authorities, the following resolution of matter 
was brought on the record of this Court: - 
 
  
 
i.        MMD shall submit IEE/EIA Reports 
and shall obtain Environmental Approval for 
the project of mining under Section-12 of the 
PEP Act, 1997 (Amended 2012) prior to 
commencement of bidding process and prior 
to issuance of Offer‟s Letters to the 
successful bidders.    
 
 
 
ii. 
The Environmental approvals would 
be issued to MMD who will be responsible to 
monitor the execution of the terms and 
conditions of the Environmental approvals. 
 
 
However, EPA would also extend its 
expertise in monitoring of the terms and 
conditions as and when requested by the 
MMD. In case of violation of the terms and 

 
Writ Petition No. 23394-2023                         
 
4 
conditions, MMD would initiate action 
against the violators, under the Punjab 
Mining Concessions Rules-2002. 
 
5.   
Recently, in case titled “Public Interest Law 
Association of Pakistan registered under the Societies 
Act, 1860 through authorized person Chaudhry Awais 
Ahmed versus Province of Punjab through Chief 
Secretary, Civil Secretariat, Lower Mall, Lahore and 
others” (C. P. No. 55 of 2020), the Honourable Supreme 
Court of Pakistan has resolved the matter of 
responsibility as to obtaining environmental approval and 
reports. It has been settled that impact on environment 
must be looked into, before bidding commences, by the 
MMD. It will be beneficial to reproduce the following 
extract from the said judgment:-   
  
“In this context, we have examined the 
Regulations and agree with the contention of the 
learned counsel for the Petitioner that there is 
no timeline provided within which these 
approvals are to be obtained nor does it specify 
any process to bind the successful bidder of the 
project to the terms of any EMP or other 
measures provided for in the IEE or EIA. 
However, the Regulations do clarify that the 
proponent of the project has to obtain the IEE or 
the EIA and in this case, the proponent of the 
project will always be the MMD, hence the 
practice of requiring a successful bidder to 
obtain an IEE or EIA after bidding of the project 
totally negates the purpose and impact of these 
reports. The impact on the environment must be 
looked into before bidding commences by the 
MMD and at the time of bidding a bidder must 
know the terms set out in the IEE or EIA that 
they are bound by and are required to comply 
with especially the mitigation measures and the 
EMP. Hence, it is the MMD that is responsible 
for obtaining these reports before initiating the 
process for bidding of the said projects.”  
(Underlining is added)

 6.   
Report submitted by respondents No. 1 to 4 
reflects that MMD before the previous auction of the 
Sand Blocks has obtained NOC from EPA in 2019 and 
through letter dated 02.09.2020 EPA intimated MMD that 
project proponent can submit application for extension 
for the said projects without filing fresh IEE / EIA 
reports provided shape and area of the project remains 
unchanged.  On 10.04.2023 this Court was intimated that 
the matter of grant of NOC is in process and issue is 
likely to be resolved within a week. This stance of MMD 
was not denied by EPA on the said date of hearing. 
Today, NOC / letter for extension of environmental 
approvals dated 14.04.2023 in respect of the Sand Blocks 
for 03 years therefrom, has been brought on the record of 
this Court.  
 7.   
Mr. Babar Aman Babar, the Secretary Mines 
and Minerals Punjab has drawn the attention of the Court 
towards certain corrective measures and steps taken 
towards reforms in this regard. Office order dated 
03.03.2023 of MMD has been produced before the Court 
which reveals that directions to field officers and 
licensing authorities have been issued that as and when 
the revision process of mines and mineral zones is 
required the same should be initiated at least one year 
before expiry of already granted lease rights. At the same 
time, officers concerned have also been directed to 
complete the process and obtain required approval from 
EPA as well as other approvals / reports not less than 
three months prior to expiry of the previous lease period. 
8.  
 
In course of arguments before this Court,     
Ch. Imran Raza Chadhar, learned counsel for the 

 
Writ Petition No. 23394-2023                         
 
6 
petitioner and the Secretary, Mines and Minerals Punjab 
have consensus on one point, which is regarding possible 
threat of unauthorized excavation, theft of minerals and 
possibility of collusiveness between officials and 
contractors. The Court has been apprised that where these 
evils have caused massive loss to the Government 
exchequer in the past, at the same time the menace of 
theft of minerals, unauthorized mining can have serious 
environment bearing as the same perchance can go even 
unchecked by EPA. Some documents and office orders 
are placed before the Court that also include notification 
dated 22.02.2023 and notification dated 03.03.2023 that 
reflect initiatives taken to control the theft, malpractice 
and unauthorized mining or excavation as well as 
increase transparency in bidding process, easy access to 
information etc. Nevertheless, MMD representatives have 
assured that the requisite approvals shall be obtained in 
future well before conducting auctions and it is 
confirmed by all the respondents that the meeting of the 
Secretaries of the two departments (MMD and EPA) has 
already 
taken 
place 
to 
encounter 
the 
above 
apprehensions. It is expected from MMD that all the 
remedial measures, as discussed above, shall be taken in 
most effective manners and at earliest. In view of the fact 
that NOC from EPA has already been obtained and the 
future assurances by MMD, the grievance of the 
petitioner as to shifting responsibility of obtaining NOC 
on prospective bidders including the petitioner and / or 
the possibility of any loss to successful bidders for failure 
to obtain approvals / NOC by MMD from EPA vis-à-vis 
the Sand Blocks, do not subsist any further and for such 
matters even otherwise, comprehensive guidelines have 

 
Writ Petition No. 23394-2023                         
 
7 
already been given to MMD as well as EPA and other 
concerned by the Honourable Supreme Court in Public 
Interest Law Association of Pakistan case (supra).  
 9.   
Now coming to objection of Mr. Muhammad 
Naseem Kashmiri, learned Law Officer and Mr. Rashid 
Bhatti, learned Legal Advisor of MMD regarding the 
conduct of the petitioner that is very strongly put-forth 
before this Court. In paragraph No. 7 of the instant 
constitution petition, the petitioner has disclosed that he 
wants to participate in auction. It is overall impression 
given in this constitution petition as well as it remained 
the arguments before this Court that petitioner is desirous 
to participate in auction of the Sand Blocks. The relevant 
paragraph of constitution petition reads as follows: - 
        “That the publication of proclamation 
for the auction of sand leases of Lahore, in 
which petitioner is fully interested in order to 
run his business and in order to avoid 
litigation after obtaining any of lease through 
competitive mode without obtaining NOC / 
IEE / EIA from the respondents No. 5 & 6 by 
the respondents No. 1 to 4 will create 
multiplicity litigation and problems and even 
otherwise it was the duty of respondents No. 
1 to 4 while obeying the order of this Hon‟ble 
Court as mentioned supra obtaining NOC 
first and thereafter put to auction any of 
lease through proclamation, which is free 
from all encumbrances and without any legal 
hurdle in order to run peaceful business by 
the lessee and putting the said leases for 
auction without obtaining permission from 
respondents No. 5 & 6 is illegal, unlawful, 
having direct impact upon environment and 
courts are taking strict action in order to get 
better environment for the citizens of this 
country especially in Lahore.”    
 
 
 
However, in civil suit titled “Muhammad Aslam versus 
The Province of Punjab and another”, the petitioner has 

 
Writ Petition No. 23394-2023                         
 
8 
managed to obtain stay order with respect to one of the 
sand block namely Badharu / Chamrupur Zone. It is 
stated in the said civil suit that the auction is contrary to 
the interest of the petitioner and he asserted some oral 
promise of MMD to extend the lease of Badharu / 
Chamrupur Zone. The petitioner, in the two proceedings 
(i.e. the instant constitution petition and the civil suit) has 
sought to declare the auction dated 11.04.2023, to the 
extent of one zone, against law but on different grounds. 
The stance adopted in the two proceedings is 
incompatible. It will be useful to reproduce para No. 4 of 
the suit titled “Muhammad Aslam versus The Province of 
Punjab and another”, which reads as follows:-  
“That the defendants issued a publication in 
newspaper of Chamru Pur Zone of auction of 
mines and the date of auction has been fixed 
11.04.2023 which is contrary to the interest 
of plaintiff because the plaintiff has already 
verbally promised to extend the period of 
lease for 6 months to meets the expenses 
afford by the plaintiff in order to construction 
of road that‟s were leads to the Chamru Pur 
Mines.” 
10.   
In civil miscellaneous application No. 02 of 
2023 the petitioner sought suspension of auction of Sand 
Blocks / subject matter of this constitution petition. This 
application was fixed on 06.04.2023, when notices were 
issued to the respondents for 10.04.2023. This Court 
considered it appropriate not to suspend the auction but 
to decide that the further process would be subject to the 
outcome of the petition. On 10.04.2023 EPA maintained 
that the matter of granting NOC is likely to be resolved 

 
Writ Petition No. 23394-2023

within one week. MMD also undertook that in case NOC 
is not issued they will not waste time in returning the 
amounts to the participants in auction. These statements 
were made by EPA and MMD to avoid any loss to Govt. 
exchequer and at the same time to ensure that citizens or 
participants of bidding process should not lose 
confidence. The Constitution petition was fixed for 
17.04.2023 for arguments, when it was unearthed that the 
petitioner has already obtained restraining order from the 
learned civil Court from dispossessing the petitioner from 
one of the blocks namely Bhadru / Chamrupur Zone. The 
auction of rest of blocks was conducted on 11.04.2023 
but due to restraining order the auction of block Bhadru / 
Chamrupur Zone was not held. This suit before the 
learned civil Court was filed on 08.04.2023 but on 
10.04.2023 the petitioner never disclosed about filing of 
the said suit. On 17.04.2023 when MMD representatives 
were asked about obtaining of NOC and outcome of 
auction, they disclosed that the auction of block Bhadru / 
Chamrupur Zone could not take place as on the day 
(10.04.2023) when this case was being heard by this 
Court, by adopting a different stance, interim relief was 
obtained from the learned civil Court. 
11.   
I have gone through the civil suit, affidavit 
attached with the same and the record but no disclosure 
about the pendency present petition or proceedings 
before this Court is found. On the one hand the petitioner 
kept maintaining before this Court till 17.04.2023 that he 
wants to participate in the forthcoming auction but the 
only hurdle is failure to obtain NOC by MMD and on the 
other hand the petitioner argued his case before learned 
civil Court on the basis that he is entitled to extension of 

 
Writ Petition No. 23394-2023                         
 
10 
lease of Bhadru / Chamrupur Zone for which he asserted 
verbal promise of MMD for such extension. Apparently, 
the petitioner managed all this by engaging two different 
learned advocates and by keeping the Courts as well as 
said learned advocates in dark about all this. It appears 
that the petitioner was not interested in adjudication of 
cause(s) on merits but to get auction stopped and to retain 
possession of the land in question.  
12.  
I am of firm view that litigants are duty bound 
not just to give disclosure before the Courts as to any 
other pending litigation, having direct or indirect effect 
on the proceedings or its outcome but at the same time 
the disclosure must be full and fair to enable the Courts 
to do complete justice, expeditiously. The conduct of the 
litigants causing obstruction in duty of the Courts 
towards bona fide litigants and such abuse of process is 
already curbed by the Courts in various judgments 
including cases titled “Mrs. Zeenat Ahmed versus 
Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Ministry of 
Defence and others” (2015 PLC (C.S.) 719), “Wali 
Muhammad and others versus Sakhi Muhammad and 
others” (PLD 1974 Supreme Court 106), “Faiz Bakhsh 
and 
others 
versus 
Deputy 
Commissioner/Land 
Acquisition Officer, Bahawalpur and others” (2006 
SCMR 219) and “Major (Retd.) Ahmed Nadeem Sadal 
and 3 others versus Federation of Pakistan through 
Secretary Sports, Islamabad and 3 others” (2015 CLC 
34). Grant of relief under Article 199 of the Constitution 
of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 is a discretionary 
power of the High Court. A person seeking relief has to 
satisfy the conscience of the Court that he has 
approached the Court with clean hands. In case titled 

 
Writ Petition No. 23394-2023                         
 
11 
Faiz Bakhsh and others (supra), the Honourable 
Supreme Court of Pakistan has observed as follows:- 
         “It is well-entrenched legal proposition that 
“conduct of petitioner can be taken into 
consideration 
in 
allowing 
or 
disallowing 
equitable relief in constitutional jurisdiction. The 
principle that the Court should be lean in favour 
of adjudication of causes on merits, appears to be 
available for invocation only when the person 
relying on it himself comes to the Court with clean 
hands and equitable considerations also lie in his 
favour. High Court, in exercise of writ jurisdiction 
is bound to proceed on maxim „he who seeks 
equity must do equity‟. Constitutional jurisdiction 
is an equitable jurisdiction. Whoever comes to 
High Court to seek relief has to satisfy the 
conscience of the Court that he has clean hands. 
Writ jurisdiction cannot be exercised in aid of 
injustice. The High Court will not grant relief 
under this Article when the petitioner does not 
come to the Court with clean hands. He may claim 
relief only when he himself is not violating 
provisions of law, especially of the law under 
which he is claiming entitlement. Manzoor 
Hussain v. Zulfiqar Ali 1983 SCMR 137; Khan 
Gul v. District Judge, Attock, PLD 1990 Lah. 263 
and P.G. Barganza v. Border Area Allotment 
Committee 1984 CLC 1479. The Constitutional 
jurisdiction as conferred upon under Article 199 
of the Constitution cannot be invoked by anyone 
who 
is 
guilty 
of 
bad 
faith 
and 
with 
unconscionable conduct. The right is in the 
nature or ex debito justitiae, but will only be 
granted if the petitioner can show that his conduct 
has not been such as to disentitle him of such a 
relief.” 
 
 
(Emphasis is supplied) 
13.   
For what has been discussed above, the present 
petition, having no substance, is dismissed. No order as 
to costs.
