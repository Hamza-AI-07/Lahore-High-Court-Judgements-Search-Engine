2. 
Brief facts of the case are that respondents No.1 to 3 / 
plaintiffs (hereinafter may be referred as respondent/plaintiff)  
instituted a suit for possession through specific performance 
on the basis of written agreement to sell dated 06.07.1987 

R.S.A. No.67/2013

against the appellants and respondent No.4/ defendants 
alleging therein that Muhammad Asghar predecessor-in-
interest of the appellants /defendant No.1 agreed to sell his 
mortgaged land measuring 177-Kanals 05-Marlas fully 
described in Paragraph No.1 of the plaint (suit property) 
against consideration of Rs.27,500/- per acre, out of which, 
he received Rs.2,00,000/- as earnest money and handed over 
possession of the land to respondents No.1 to 3/plaintiffs. It 
was settled between the parties that after redemption of land 
till 06.01.1988 from agricultural bank and attestation of 
mutation of inheritance of his mother Mst. Janat Bibi, the 
vendor (Muhammad Asghar-defendant No.1 predecessor  in 
interest of the appellants) would get registered a sale deed in 
favour of respondents No.1 to 3/plaintiffs. On 13.01.1988, 
respondents No.1 to 3/ plaintiffs sent a notice in the name of 
appellants predecessor/ defendant No.1 asking him to 
perform his part of agreement but he did not honour the 
agreement rather in derogation of the above agreement, he 
ultimately sold land to his brother-in-law namely Noor 
Muhammad /respondent No.4 /defendant No.2 through 
receipt dated 10.06.1987 by preparing an agreement to sell 
dated 04.07.1987.  
Respondent No.4/ Noor Muhammad also filed a suit 
for possession through specific performance titled Noor 
Muhammad Vs. Muhammad Shafi etc., in which defendant 
No.1 filed a consenting written statement, whereas 

R.S.A. No.67/2013 
3 
 
respondents No.1 to 3 / plaintiffs filed an application under 
Order 1 Rule 10 CPC for their impleadment as defendants in 
the said suit.  
On 25.06.1988, respondents No.1 to 3/ plaintiffs again 
sent a notice to defendant No.1 for performance of agreement 
to sell in their favour but he refused. During the pendency of 
the suit, defendant No.1/appellants predecessor Muhammad 
Asghar 
and 
respondent 
No.4/defendant 
No.2 
Noor 
Muhammad died and their legal heirs were impleaded as 
defendants. 
Appellants 
predecessor 
and 
respondent 
No.4/defendants filed contesting written statement whereas 
defendants conceded the claim of legal heirs of Noor 
Muhammad (respondent No.4/defendant No.2) and asserted 
that the agreement to sell dated 06.07.1987 in favour of 
respondents No.1 to 3/ plaintiffs is a forged and fictitious 
document. That appellants predecessor /defendant No.1 
neither sold the suit property to respondents No.1 to 3 nor 
received any earnest money. Respondents No.1 to 3 / 
plaintiffs Muhammad Saddique etc. also filed another suit 
titled as Muhammad Saddique etc. Vs. Muhammad Shafi etc. 
and a suit titled as Noor Muhammad Vs. Muhammad Shafi 
etc. was also filed. All three suits were consolidated. As per 
respective divergent pleadings of the parties, the following 
issues were framed:

The parties at discord led their pro and contra oral as well as 
documentary evidence. The learned trial court vide 
consolidated judgment & decree dated 16.05.1992 dismissed 
the suit of respondent No.4 titled as Noor Muhammad Vs. 
Muhammad Shafi etc. and decreed the suits of respondents 
No.1 to 3 titled as “Muhammad Saddique etc. Vs. 
Muhammad Shafi etc.” and “Muhammad Saddique etc. Vs. 
Muhammad Asghar etc.” Against the said consolidated 
judgment & decree, following three appeals were filed:  
1. RFA No.212/1992  
(Muhammad Asghar etc. Vs. Muhammad Siddique etc.) 
2. RFA No.213 /1992  
(Muhammad Shafi etc. Vs. Muhammad Siddique etc.)  
3. RFA No.135 of 1992

This Court accepted the above appeals vide judgment dated 
24.10.1995 and by setting aside the impugned judgment & 
decree remanded the cases to the learned trial court for 

R.S.A. No.67/2013 
5 
 
decision afresh in accordance with law after affording 
reasonable opportunity to the parties to produce evidence in 
support of their respective averments. Against the above said 
judgment [dated 24.10.1995] of this Court, respondents No.1 
to 3 Muhammad Saddique etc. and appellants predecessor 
filed Civil Appeal Nos.1401 to 1403 of 1995 which were 
dismissed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan vide 
order dated 19.09.2002. 
3. 
In the post-remand proceedings, suit of Noor 
Muhammad Vs. Muhammad Shafi etc., was dismissed as 
withdrawn on 03.03.2007 whereafter the learned trial court 
on 23.05.2007 de-consolidated the remaining two suits titled 
as Muhammad Saddique etc. Vs. Muhammad Shafi etc. as 
well as Muhammad Saddique etc. Vs. Muhammad Asghar 
etc., and re-framed fresh issues in each suit. The issues 
framed in the instant suit are reproduced as under:- 
“ISSUES. 
1. 
Whether plaintiffs are entitled to get decree for 
possession through specific performance as prayed 
for? OPP. 
2.

in question to the plaintiffs through agreement to 
sell dated 06-07-1987 and Rs.2,00,000/- were

8. 
Whether the suit is not maintainable in its present 
form? OPD. 
9. 
Relief?”   
 
After framing of the above issues the plaintiffs were required 
to produce evidence in order to prove the case as well as to 
dislodge the burden of the issues, but instead of leading 
evidence, respondents No.1 to 3 / plaintiffs filed an 
application under Section 151 CPC for getting permission to 
submit certified copy of statements of their witnesses 
recorded in consolidated trial in the suit titled as Noor 
Muhammad Vs Muhammad Shafi etc. The said application 
was refused vide order dated 24.10.2007 but the learned trial 
court later on without recalling the aforementioned order 
granted permission on 27.06.2009 to place on record the 
earlier statements and the learned counsel for respondents 
No.1 to 3 got recorded his statement and also produced 
attested copy of evidence in the form of Exh.P1 to Exh.P14 
and on the basis of said evidence, the learned trial court 
decreed the suit of respondents No.1 to 3 vide judgment & 
decree dated 18.10.2010. Against the said decision, the 
appeals of the appellants Mst. Rajan Bibi etc. and 
Muhammad Tufail etc. were also dismissed by the learned 
appellate court vide consolidated judgment & decree dated 
16.04.2013. Hence, this appeal. 
4. 
I have heard the learned counsels for the parties at full 
length and gone through the record with their able assistance.

5. 
The suit land is measuring 379-Kanals 13-Marlas 
(included both properties) whereas suit titled as Muhammad 
Saddique etc. Vs Muhammad Asghar etc. relates to land 
measuring 177-Kanals 05-Marlas. For ready reference, chart 
showing the properties of three suits is as under:-

Initially three suits for possession through specific 
performance of the agreement to sell were filed by the 
respective parties, out of which, two suits were filed by 
respondents No.1 to 3 titled as Muhammad Saddique etc. Vs. 
Muhammad Shafi etc. and Muhammad Saddique etc. Vs. 
Muhammad Asghar etc. whereas one suit was filed by 
respondent No.4 titled as Noor Muhammad Vs. Muhammad 
Shafi etc. The learned trial court dismissed the suit for 
possession through specific performance of agreement to sell 
filed by respondent No.4 Noor Muhammad whereas two 
suits for possession through specific performance of 
agreement to sell filed by respondents No.1 to 3 against 
appellants predecessor Muhammad Asghar/defendant No.1 
and Muhammad Shafi etc. respectively were decreed. 
Against the said decision Muhammad Asghar etc., 
Muhammad Shafi etc. & Noor Muhammad filed the 
respective appeals [R.F.A No.212/1992, R.F.A. No.213/1992 

R.S.A. No.67/2013 
8 
 
& R.F.A.135/1992] and this court accepted the said appeals, 
set aside the impugned judgment & decree therein and 
remanded the cases to the learned trial court for decision 
afresh in accordance with law after affording reasonable 
opportunity to the parties to produce evidence in support of 
their respective averments. For ready reference, operative 
part of judgment dated 24.10.1995 is reproduced as under:- 
“For the fore-going reasons, all the three appeals are 
accepted, impugned judgments and decrees are set aside 
and the case is remanded to the trial Court for decision 
afresh in accordance with law after affording reasonable 
opportunity to the parties to produce evidence in support 
of their respective averments.”  
6. 
Feeling aggrieved with the above said judgment of this 
Court, respondents No.1 to 3 Muhammad Saddique etc. and 
defendant No.1/ appellants predecessor Muhammad Asghar 
filed Civil Appeal Nos.1401 to 1403 of 1995 which were 
dismissed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan vide 
order dated 19.09.2002 and remand order of this Court was 
maintained. For ready reference, operative part of order dated 
19.09.2002 is reproduced as under:- 
“4. We have heard learned counsel for the respondents and 
are of the considered view that the contentions raised by 
the learned counsel for the appellants have no force. The 
contention that issue No.3 which was substantial issue had 
been amended by shifting the onus of proof, therefore, it 
was incumbent upon the trial court to give opportunity to 
the parties to lead evidence if they wanted to do so. In 
these circumstances, there is no question of making any 
application before the High Court for permission to lead 
additional evidence, for the respondents’ case before the 
High Court was that they as a matter of right were entitled 
to be granted an opportunity to produce evidence on the 
said amended issue whereas grant or non-grant of 
permission to produce additional evidence is discretionary 
and not right of a party which application could be made 
even after availing of opportunity of production of 
evidence granted by law. 

R.S.A. No.67/2013

5. 
As to the argument about direction given by the 
learned District Judge to expedite the disposal of the suits, 
it may be mentioned here that the said direction did not 
have the effect of divesting the trial court of its powers 
under the Civil Procedure Code to grant adjournments in 
the cases where they were necessary to do justice. If the 
time granted by the learned District Judge was found to be 
not sufficient, the trial court could request for enlargement 
thereof rather than depriving the parties from their right of 
production of evidence. In these cases, the respondents 
were entitled to be given an opportunity as a matter of 
right to produce evidence after amendment of issue No.3 
and they having been deprived of the same as such, the 
remand of the cases through the impugned judgment by 
the High Court was legally justified to which no exception 
can be taken. 
6. 
For the foregoing reasons, we do not find any 
merits in these appeals which are accordingly dismissed 
leaving the parties to bear their own costs.”       
7. 
In the first round of litigation, the evidence of all the 
parties was recorded in a suit filed by respondent No.4 titled 
as Noor Muhammad Vs Muhammad Shafi etc., whereas in 
post-remand proceedings, the above said suit was dismissed 
as withdrawn on 03.03.2007. According to the changed 
scenario of lis, the learned trial court on 23.05.2007 de-
consolidated the remaining pending suits [titled as 
Muhammad Saddique etc. Vs Muhammad Asghar etc. and 
Muhammad Saddique etc. Vs Muhammad Shafi etc.] and 
framed as many as eight new issues in each case. After 
framing the new issues as mentioned in the paragraph No.3 
of the instant judgment, the case was fixed for evidence of 
plaintiffs /respondents No.1 to 3 for 01.06.2007 but on the 
said date the evidence of plaintiffs /respondents No.1 to 3 
was not present and on their request the case was adjourned 
for 09.06.2007, whereafter the plaintiffs/ respondents No.1 to 
3 availed numerous opportunities but they did not produce 

R.S.A. No.67/2013 
10 
 
any fresh evidence, however, they filed an application under 
Section 151 CPC with the request that file of decided case 
titled Noor Muhammad Vs. Muhammad Shafi etc. should be 
requisitioned for decision of the suit. The said application 
was dismissed by the learned Civil Judge, Chunian vide 
order dated 24.10.2007 which is as under:- 
“Brief contents of application u/s 161 CPC are 
that the present suit was consolidated with a suit titled 
Noor Muhammad Vs. Muhammad Shafi etc. and 
consolidated issues were framed, however, the suit 
title Noor Muhammad Vs. Muhammad Shafi etc. was 
dismissed as withdrawn and consolidated evidence 
was available on the record of that suit, therefore, this 
file is prayed to be summoned, so to be read in present 
files and suit shall be concluded. 
On the other hand, learned counsel for the 
defendants opposed the application and prayed for its 
dismissal. 
Arguments heard, file perused. 
In my humble view as the suit has been 
dismissed and file has been consigned to record room, 
the evidence available on the file is a judicial record. 
As the plaintiff is always entitled to file attested copies 
of the same. As this is an old case and files are under 
inspection, if consigned record is summoned from 
Kasur, it would delay the proceedings, therefore, 
application is forceless is hereby dismissed. Now to 
come up for evidence of the plaintiff for 6.11.07. This 
would be treated as last opportunity for producing 
evidence.” 
After passing of the above order, despite caution of last 
opportunity for producing evidence, plaintiffs/ respondents 
did not produce any evidence and case was adjourned for 
19.11.2007 with last and final opportunity with the caution of 
initiation of penal action but the evidence of plaintiff/ 
respondents was not present on 19.11.2007 and another 

R.S.A. No.67/2013 
11 
 
opportunity was granted with cost of Rs.100/- and case was 
adjourned to 21.11.2007 with the caution that if the evidence 
was not produced then their right to produce evidence would 
be closed. Even on 21.11.2007, the plaintiff/ respondents 
failed to adduce their evidence and another opportunity was 
granted for 28.11.2007 with the condition that if the evidence 
was not produce then penal action to close their right of 
evidence would be taken. On 28.11.2007, counsel of the 
appellant / defendant sought an adjournment and case was 
adjourned for evidence of plaintiff / respondents for 
29.11.2007. On 29.11.2007, again on the request of the 
appellants/defendants case was adjourned for respondents 
evidence on 30.11.2007. On 01.12.2007, learned counsel for 
the appellants/ defendants stated that defendants were 
aggrieved with the order of the trial court and intended to 
assail the same before proper forum and case was adjourned 
for respondents/ plaintiffs evidence for 12.12.2007. On 
12.12.2007, the case was adjourned for recording of evidence 
on 14.12.2007 with the direction to the defendants to cross 
examine the witnesses otherwise appropriate order would be 
passed. On 14.12.2007, learned counsel for the plaintiffs 
/respondents submitted that he had to record only his 
statement for producing the documentary evidence as such 
there was no need to adduce oral evidence as the already 
recorded evidence in consolidated suit was available with the 

R.S.A. No.67/2013 
12 
 
file of suits and that evidence would be sufficient for proof of 
the stance taken in the suits. The said statement is as under:- 
“Learned counsel for the plaintiff submits that 
he had to only record his statement for adducing the 
documentary evidence and there is no need for calling 
oral evidence. He further submits that as the 
consolidation order is available on the record in three 
of the suits and thus as the proceedings were taken on 
in the suit which was subsequently withdrawn and 
evidence was recorded in that particular suit with 
consolidation order is sufficient for adducing evidence 
already recorded in this suit also.”  
After the above statements, the case was adjourned for 
appellants’ evidence for 17.12.2007. On the said date, an 
application for initiation of legal proceedings against the 
plaintiff /respondents was filed by the appellants/ defendants 
and case was adjourned for 10.01.2008 for written reply and 
arguments. From 10.01.2008 to 10.06.2009, the case 
remained pending for arguments on said application. On 
10.06.2009, the learned trial court observed that on 
24.10.2007 the request of the respondents/ plaintiffs for 
producing the attested copies of statements of witnesses was 
turned down and successors of Muhammad Asghar 
/defendant No.1 filed revision petition which was decided by 
the learned Additional District Judge, Chunian on 29.04.2008 
with the direction to decide the application of the 
respondents/ plaintiff and case was adjourned for 27.06.2009 
for evidence of the respondents whereafter the case was 
adjourned for different times for evidence of the respondents. 
On 07.04.2010, the learned counsel for the plaintiff-

R.S.A. No.67/2013 
13 
 
respondents in his own statement produced documentary 
evidence Exh.P1 to Exh.P14 whereafter the defendants filed 
an application for summoning of file of case titled as Noor 
Muhamamd Vs. Muhammad Shafi etc. which was accepted 
on 01.07.2010 and case file was ordered to be produced from 
the record room for 12.07.2010. On 21.09.2010, after 
requisitioning the file appellants/ defendants were directed to 
produce their evidence otherwise their right to produce 
evidence would be closed by invoking the powers under 
Order XVII Rule 3 CPC and case was adjourned for 
defendants evidence with last opportunity for 24.09.2010. On 
24.09.2010 the evidence of the appellants/ defendants was 
not present and the case was adjourned to 27.09.2010 with 
last opportunity to the defendants. On 24.09.2010, the 
evidence of the defendants was not present and the case was 
adjourned for 27.09.2010 with last opportunity to the 
defendants to produce evidence. On 27.09.2010, the 
appellants/ defendants did not produce the evidence and their 
right to produce evidence was closed by the learned trial 
court and adjourned the case for arguments on 29.09.2010 
and finally the impugned judgment & decree dated 
18.10.2010 was passed by decreeing the suits filed by 
plaintiffs/ respondents No.1 to 3 Muhammad Saddique etc.   
8. 
Admittedly after remand of the matter, in the post 
remand proceedings the suits were de-consolidated and fresh 
issues were also framed but the respondent/plaintiff did not 

R.S.A. No.67/2013 
14 
 
produce any witness to prove the issues whereas their learned 
counsel produced documents Ex.P1 to Ex.P14 in his own 
statement. The case of the respondent/plaintiff is of no 
evidence. It is settled law that the documents relied upon or 
on the basis of which the pleading (plaint or written 
statement) has been filed should be produced in the evidence 
by party itself and an opportunity should be given to the 
other party to cross-examine the same, as such the documents 
produced by the respondents-plaintiffs  counsel cannot be 
relied upon as valid tender of evidence and such documents 
are liable to be excluded from consideration. Reliance is 
placed on the cases cited as Mst. Hameeda Begum & Others 
Vs. Mst. Irshad Begum & Others (2007 SCMR 996), 
Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Ministry of 
Defence & Another Vs. Jaffar Khan & Others (PLD 2010 
SC 604), Province of the Punjab through Collector, 
Sheikhupura & Others Vs. Syed Ghazanfar Ali Shah & 
Others (2017 SCMR 172) and Mst. Akhtar Sultana Vs. 
Major Retd. Muzaffar Khan Malik through his legal heirs 
and others (PLD 2021 SC 715).

Moreover, under Article 47 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat 
Order, 1984, the evidence given by a witness in a judicial 
proceeding, or before any person authorized by law to take it, 
is relevant for the purpose of proving, in a subsequent 
judicial proceeding, or in a later stage of the same judicial 
proceeding, the truth of the facts which states that the witness 

R.S.A. No.67/2013 
15 
 
is dead or cannot be found, or is incapable of giving 
evidence, or is kept out of the way by the adverse party, or if 
his presence cannot be obtained without an amount of delay 
or expense which, under the circumstances of the case, the 
Court considers unreasonable. For ready reference, Article 47 
of Order ibid is reproduced as under:- 
“47.Relevancy of certain evidence for proving, in 
subsequent proceeding, the truth of facts therein 
stated. Evidence given by a witness in a judicial 
proceeding, or before any person authorized by law to take

judicial proceeding, or in a later stage of the same judicial 
proceeding, the truth of the facts which states, when the 
witness is dead or cannot be found, or is incapable of 
giving evidence, or is kept out of the way by the adverse 
party, or if his presence cannot be obtained without an 
amount of delay or expense which, under the 
circumstances 
of 
the 
case, 
the 
Court 
considers 
unreasonable:  
Provided that; 
the proceeding was between the same parties or their 
representatives-in-interest; 
the adverse party in the first proceeding had the right and 
opportunity to cross-examine; 
the questions in issue were substantially the same in the 
first as in the second proceeding.  
Explanation. A criminal trial or inquiry shall be deemed 
to be a proceeding between the prosecutor and the accused 
within the meaning of this Article.”  
Article 47 of Order ibid demonstrates that the following 
necessary conditions are to be complied with; 
(i) 
The earlier evidence was taken in a judicial 
proceedings. 
(ii) 
The first proceeding was between the same parties. 
(iii) 
The party against whom deposition is tendered had a 
right and full opportunity of cross examination the 
deponent when the deposition was taken. 
(iv) 
The issues involved are the same or substantially the 
same is both proceedings. 
(v) 
The witness is incapable of being called at the 
subsequent proceeding on account of death, or

R.S.A. No.67/2013

As initially three suits were filed wherein consolidated issues 
were framed and all the parties led their respective oral and 
documentary evidence but in the post-remand proceedings, 
the suit filed by respondent No.4 Noor Muhammad, 
regarding agreement qua land measuring 379-Kanals was 
dismissed as withdrawn whereas rest of two suits were de-
consolidated and fresh issues were framed by the trial court 
and the suits were fixed for evidence of respondents / 
plaintiffs but no evidence was produced rather the learned 
counsel for the plaintiffs made his own solitary statement on 
07.04.2010 and produced the attested copies of evidence as 
well as statements of the witnesses, which had already been 
recorded in earlier consolidated trial of suit of Noor 
Muhammad which suit was dismissed as withdrawn on 
03.03.2007. In the said lis, the respondent / plaintiff and 
Noor Muhammad in their respective pleadings controverted 
the execution of agreement viz a viz each other on which 
basis the said suits were  consolidated, accordingly issues 
were framed and parties led their respective pro and contra 
evidence. But In post-remand proceedings fresh issues were 
framed by the learned trial court whereafter plaintiffs/ 
respondents under Order XVIII CPC as well as Article 117, 
118 and 127 of Qanun-i-Shahadat Order, 1984 were under 
obligation to prove the agreement to sell by producing both 
marginal 
witnesses 
through 
affirmative, 
trustworthy, 
corroborative and solid evidence. Moreover, in Article 47 of 

R.S.A. No.67/2013 
17 
 
the Order ibid, the parameters are prescribed but no reason 
has been brought on record by the respondents/ plaintiffs that 
the witnesses are incapable or they have dead or incapability 
of the witnesses as settled in a case titled as Ali Akbar Vs. The 
State (PLD 1997 Karachi 146) wherein it is held as under:- 
“14. The first point to be considered is whether or not 
the evidence of the complainant could be considered by 
the trial Court. It appears that by consent his evidence 
was brought on record and subsequently it was relied 
upon, Section 353, Cr.P.C., lays down that all evidence 
taken, under Chapters XX, XXI, XXII and XXI-A of 
Cr.P.C., shall be taken in presence of accused or when 
his personal attendance is dispensed with, in presence of 
his pleader, Article 47 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 
prescribes the conditions under which secondary 
evidence of the testimony of a witness in the former 
proceeding, civil or criminal, is admissible in 
subsequent proceeding or in a later stage of the same 
proceeding where the question in controversy in both 
proceedings is identical and where the witness is dead 
or cannot be found or is incapable of giving evidence. 
Before such evidence could be made admissible, the 
following conditions are necessary to be complied with: 
(i) That the earlier evidence was taken in judicial 
proceedings. 
(ii) That the first proceeding was between the 
same parties. 
(iii) That the party against whom deposition is 
tendered had a right and full opportunity of cross-
examining the deponent when the deposition was taken. 
(iv) That the issues involved are the same or 
substantially the same in both proceedings. 
(v) That the witness is incapable of being called 
at the subsequent proceeding on account of death, or 
incapability of giving evidence or being kept out of the 
way by the other side or an unreasonable amount of 
delay or expenses.”  
 
 
 
(emphasis supplied)  
Thus the parameter of relevancy of the evidence of one case 
to other as per Article 47 of the Order ibid have not been 
fulfilled by respondents / plaintiffs. When in post remand 
proceedings after de-consolidation of suit, fresh issues were 
framed regarding divergent assertion/pleading of the adverse 
parties in respect of land measuring 177-Kanals 05-Marlas 

R.S.A. No.67/2013 
18 
 
than plaintiffs were placed under onus to prove their case 
through affirmative, corroborative & trustworthy evidence as 
per law, but they only produced evidence already recorded in 
another suit which cannot be considered as a relevant piece 
of evidence in the instant case. Reliance in this regard is 
placed on cases cited as State through Advocate-General 
Sindh, Karachi Vs. Farman Hussain and others (PLD 1995 
SC 1) and Ahmad Ali Vs. Ebrar Khan and another (2021 
PCr.L.J 1878).  
  
The learned courts below have neither followed the 
procedure prescribed under article 47 of Order ibid for 
consideration of evidence of one case to another nor consent 
was given by the appellants/defendants for transfer of the 
same. Even otherwise plaintiffs/ Respondents filed suit for 
possession through specific performance on the basis of 
alleged agreement to sell but they did not produce both the 
marginal witnesses of the agreement. Under Article 17 read 
with Article 79 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984, it is the 
duty of the beneficiaries plaintiffs/ / respondents to prove the 
alleged agreement to sell by producing both the marginal 
witnesses but they did not produce the marginal witness of 
the alleged agreement to sell which is non-compliance of the 
aforesaid mandatory provisions of law and this flaw is 
considered fatal for the case of the plaintiffs / respondents. 
Reliance is placed on cases cited as Hafiz Tassaduq Hussain VS 

R.S.A. No.67/2013 
19 
 
Muhammad Din through legal heirs and others (PLD 2011 SC 
241), Farzand Ali and another Vs Khuda Bakhsh and others 
(PLD 2015 SC 187) and Farid Bakhsh Vs. Jind Wadda & 
Others (2015 SCMR 1044). 
10. 
Further, respondents / plaintiffs have neither produced 
both marginal witnesses of the alleged agreement to sell in 
their evidence nor any convincing reason has been 
expounded in this regard without any just exception  which 
amounts to withholding of the material evidence and it would 
be legally presumed that had the said witness produced in the 
evidence, they would have deposed against respondents / 
plaintiffs, as such, presumption under Article 129 (g) of 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 clearly operates against them. 
Reliance is placed on the cases titled as Sughran Bibi Vs. 
Mst. Aziz Begum & 4 Others (1996 SCMR 137) & Jehangir 
Vs Mst. Shams Sultana & Others (2022 SCMR 309).  
11.  
In view of above, it can conveniently be observed that 
the case of the respondents/plaintiffs is of no evidence. The 
respondents No.1 to 3/plaintiffs have miserably failed to 
prove their case through any trustworthy, corroborative, 
reliable and convincing evidence which material facts have 
not been taken into consideration by the two courts below 
who by committing misreading and non-reading of the 
evidence illegally decided the case in favour of respondents 

R.S.A. No.67/2013 
20 
 
No.1 to 3/plaintiffs, as such the findings of the learned 
Courts below are liable to be reversed.  
12. 
As discussed above, the decisions of the learned 
Courts below suffer from blatant misreading and non-reading 
of the evidence as well as mis-application of law, as such the 
same are not sustainable in the eyes of law and are liable to 
be set-aside and this Court is well within jurisdiction to 
reverse the illegal and perverse concurrent findings. Reliance 
is placed on the cases titled as Nazim-ud-Din & Others Vs. 
Sheikh Zia-Ul-Qamar & Others (2016 SCMR 24). 
13. 
Resultantly, this Regular Second Appeal is allowed. 
Judgment & decree dated 18.10.2010 passed by the learned 
Civil Judge, Chunian, District Kasur and consolidated 
judgment & decree dated 16.04.2013 passed by the learned 
Additional District Judge, Chunian, District Kasur are hereby 
set aside and the suit for possession through specific 
performance filed by respondents No.1 to 3 / plaintiffs is 
hereby dismissed. No order as to costs.
