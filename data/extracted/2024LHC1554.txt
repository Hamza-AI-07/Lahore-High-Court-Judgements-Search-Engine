JUDGMENT 
Date of hearing 
 
27.03.2024  
 
Appellant by 
 
Mr. Sultan Ali Dogar and Mr. Ali 
Raza Hanjra, learned Advocates. 
Respondent by 
Mian 
Imran 
Mushtaq, 
learned 
Advocate. 
 
       SULTAN TANVIR AHMAD, J:–Through this 
regular first appeal, filed under section 96 of the Code of 
Civil Procedure, 1908 (the ‘Code’), judgment and decree dated 
16.09.2023  passed by learned Additional District Judge, 
Lahore has been challenged. 
 
 
2.  
On 02.12.2020 the respondent instituted suit, under 
Order XXXVII of the Code, for recovery of Rs. 16,000,000/- 
on the basis of (i) cheque No. 1561725584 dated 25.09.2019 for 
an amount of Rs. 2,000,000/-, (ii) cheque No. 00000017 dated 
09.07.2020 for an amount of Rs. 4,500,000/-, (iii) cheque No. 
00000018 dated 09.07.2020 for an amount of Rs. 3,500,000/-, 
(iv) cheque No. 00000019 dated 09.07.2020 for an amount of 
Rs. 3,500,000/- and (v) cheque No. 00000020 dated 29.07.2020 
for an amount of Rs. 2,500,000/- (the ‘cheques’). The appellant 
upon receiving summons appeared before the Court and 

 
RFA No. 69211 of  2023          (Judgment) 
 
 
2 
instituted leave application to defend the case, which was 
granted vide order dated 22.06.2022 subject to furnishing 
security / surety bond equal to the suit amount. Afterwards, the 
appellant remained unable to comply with the condition and as 
a result thereof leave granting order was recalled on 25.10.2022 
by the learned trial Court. On 16.09.2023 judgment and decree 
was passed in favour of the respondent, which is assailed 
through the present appeal. 
3. 
Mr. Sultan Ali Dogar, learned counsel for the 
appellant has argued that vide order dated 25.10.2022 the 
learned trial Court has wrongly recalled the leave granting order 
that has resulted into one sided judgment and precluding the 
appellant from presenting any defense. Learned counsel stated 
that sufficient opportunities should have been granted by the 
learned trial Court before recalling the order of granting the 
leave. Learned counsel has further argued that on the basis of 
the cheques criminal cases were registered but no conviction of 
the appellant could be secured, which is evident of the fact that 
the cheques were only given as security and they are not backed 
up by any consideration. 
4.  
Conversely, Mian Imran Mushtaq, learned counsel 
for the respondent, has argued that the cheques were issued for 
consideration as claimed in the suit and no mistake has been 
made by the learned trial Court while passing the impugned 
judgment and decree. Learned counsel has submitted that the 
appellant availed six opportunities to submit the surety bond and 
then deliberately and with the view to cause the delay in the 
proceedings, kept avoiding to comply with the order to file 
surety, resulting into recalling of the leave granting order; that 
the appellant  built up his case on the basis of order dated 
22.06.2022, which was never challenged by him rather by his 
conduct he has accepted the order, as initially the appellant kept 

 
RFA No. 69211 of  2023          (Judgment) 
 
 
3 
on making requests before the learned trial Court for granting 
him further time to file surety and then permitting to cross-
examine the witnesses of the appellant instead of raising any 
challenge to order of recalling leave; that the appellant is fully 
aware that order dated 22.06.2022 is passed in accordance with 
law and now the excuse is being made to cause further delay. 
Learned counsel has relied upon the cases titled “Col. (Retd.) 
Ashfaq Ahmed and others v. Sh. Muhammad Wasim” (1999 
SCMR 2832) and “Haji Ali Khan & Company, Abbottabad and 
8 others v. M/s. Allied Bank of Pakistan Limited, Abbottabad” 
(PLD 1995 SC 362).  
5. 
Heard. Record perused. 
6. 
Order XXXVII Rule 2 (2) of the Code contemplates 
that when the summons in the specified form are received, the 
defender of a suit of summary procedure is required to obtain 
leave to appear and defend; and, in default of his obtaining such 
leave or of his appearance and defense in pursuance thereof, the 
allegations in the plaint are deemed to be admitted, and the 
plaintiff is entitled to a decree.  
7. 
Order XXXVII Rule 3 (2) of the Code authorizes 
the learned trial Court to grant leave unconditionally or subject 
to such terms as to payment in the Court or giving security. 
Granting leave subject to condition or unconditionally is the 
discretion of the Court which is to be justly exercised while 
keeping in view the plausibility of the defense. It is not the case 
of the appellant that the discretion was exercised in arbitrary 
manners or the condition imposed was harsh or it operated 
vexatiously to the appellant. The basic argument of the learned 
counsel for the appellant remained that by recalling the leave 
granting order on 25.10.2022 the appellant was wrongly ousted 
to produce his defense and the learned trial Court acted in haste 
while recalling the leave granting order.

8. 
Order sheet of the learned trial Court reflects that 
after the grant of leave subject to above mentioned condition the 
learned counsel for appellant on 05.09.2022 requested for some 
time to file surety bond when appellant was given last 
opportunity. Thereafter, on 20.09.2022 once again same request 
was made when absolute and final opportunity was granted. The 
case was fixed for 01.10.2022. On this hearing the appellant was 
himself present in the Court and he gave undertaking with 
respect to submission of surety. The relevant part of this order 
reads as follows: - 
 
“…Record perused. PLA was 
decided 
vide 
order 
dated 
22.06.2022 and till then defendant 
has availed four opportunities. 
However, 
today 
the 
defendant 
present 
in 
person 
and 
gives 
undertaking. Put up on 15.10.2022 
for submission of surety bond…” 
 
 
The above continued until 25.10.2022 when learned 
Court clearly observed that the surety should be filed before 
closing hours of the Court but the appellant failed, apparently 
leaving the learned trial Court with no other option but to recall 
the order dated 22.06.2022 and to observe that as a consequence 
of the same leave to appear and defend the suit is deemed to be 
dismissed. The above conduct of the appellant is sufficient 
indication of the fact that the appellant accepted the condition 
and then caused undue delay of about four months just to avoid 
expeditious decision in suit.  
9. 
Order dated 25.10.2022 of the learned trial Court 
essentially means that the appellant had no leave to appear and 
defend the case in terms of Order XXXVII Rule 2 (2) of the 
Code. In case titled “Muhammad Ramzan and others v. Ghulam 
Qadir” (2011 SCMR 659) the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
observed that when a defendant of such suits fails to fulfill the 

 
RFA No. 69211 of  2023          (Judgment) 
 
 
5 
condition of the leave granted to him, the allegation in plaint 
would be deemed to be admitted and the suit can be decreed 
against him. The relevant part reads as follows: - 
 
“..The petitioners failed to fulfill the 
conditions on which leave to defend the suits were 
granted to them. Perusal of the sub-para (2) of 
rule 2 of Order XXXVII reveals that in default of 
obtaining leave to defend or to appear in his 
defence the allegation in the plaint would be 
deemed to be admitted and the suit could be 
decreed against the defendants. We would like to 
reproduce the observations of this Court, on the 
point, made in the judgment titled of Haji Ali Khan 
and Company, Abbottabad and 8 others v. Messrs 
Allied Bank of Pakistan Limited, Abbottabad (PLD 
1995 Supreme Court 362):- 
“10. The ratio decidendi of the above-
referred cases seems to be that if a 
defendant fails to appear or fails to obtain 
leave to defend in response to a summons 
served in form No.4 provided in Appendix B 
to the C.P.C. or fails to fulfil the condition 
on which leave was granted or where the 
Court refuses to grant leave, the Court is to 
pass a decree. It may further be observed 
that in sub-rule (2) of rule 2, C.P.C., it has 
been provided that if a defendant fails to 
appear or defaults in obtaining leave, the 
allegations in the plaint shall be deemed to 
be admitted and the plaintiff shall be entitled 
to a decree, but no such consequences are 
provided for in rule 3 of the above Order in a 
case where the Court refuses to grant leave 
or the defendant fails, to fulfil the condition 
on which leave, was granted. In our view, 
notwithstanding the above omission in Rule 
3, the effect of refusal of the Court to grant 
leave or failure on the part of the defendant 
to comply with the condition of the leave, 
will be the same i.e. the defendant shall not 
be entitled to defend the suit on any ground 
and the Court would pass a decree in favour 
of the plaintiff. However, this does not 
necessarily mean that the Court is not 
required to apply its mind to the facts and the 
documents before it. Every Court is required 

 
RFA No. 69211 of  2023          (Judgment) 
 
 
6 
to apply its mind before passing any order or 
judgment notwithstanding the factum that no 
person has appeared before it to oppose such 
an order or that the person who wanted to 
oppose was not allowed to oppose because 
he failed to fulfil the requirements of law.” 
 
 
 
         (Emphasis supplied) 
 
10. 
In case titled “Murtaza Haseeb Textile Mills v. 
Sitara Chemical Industries” (2004 SCMR 882), the Supreme 
Court found that since the failure of the defendant of the suit to 
comply with the order of the learned Court with respect to the 
condition of the leave was contemptuous and the same was a 
tactic to cause delay, the decree is rightly passed on the basis of 
material available on record. Almost same view was adopted in 
the case reported as “Abdullah v. Shaukat” (2001 SCMR 60). In 
“Col. (Retd.) Ashfaq Ahmed and others case (supra), the failure 
to fulfill conditions, specified in conditional order granting leave 
to defend, was found fatal when the defendant remained unable 
to furnish any plausible reason. After hearing the arguments and 
careful perusal of the law, I am of the opinion that the leave 
granting order was rightly recalled which has result that the 
appellant had no leave to appear and defend his case in terms of 
Order XXXVII Rule 2 (2) of the Code.  
11. 
So far as the contentions of the learned counsel for 
the appellant regarding discharge of the appellant from the 
criminal cases registered under section 489-F of Pakistan Penal 
Code, 1860 are concerned, suffice to say that both the criminal 
as well as civil cases have different standards of proof and 
acquittal or discharge from criminal case does not absolve a 
litigant from the civil liability, if burden is discharged by the 
other side as per the settled principles of civil standard of proof.  
12. 
The respondent has brought on record the cheques 
as Exh.P-1 to Exh.P-5 and the dishonored slips were produced 
as Exh.P-1/1 to Exh.P-5/1. Exh.P-1/1 reflects that one cheque 

 
RFA No. 69211 of  2023          (Judgment) 
 
 
7 
was returned due to insufficient fund in drawer’s account. Same 
is reflected from Exh.P-2/1 and Exh.P-4/1 for the other two 
cheques. Exh.P-3/1 shows that on 08.10.2019 the relevant 
account of the appellant was dormant. The respondent and his 
witnesses appeared and supported the plaint. There is nothing 
available to rebut the presumption that the cheques were issued 
for consideration as well as the other presumptions arising under 
the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, therefore, the learned trial 
Court has correctly decreed the suit. 
13.  
 
For what has been discussed above, the present 
appeal, having no merits, is dismissed. No order as to costs.
