(JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT) 
 
Civil Revision No.15213/2023 
 
                             Amir Sajjad         Vs.        Ghulam Murtaza Ch. 
 
JUDGMENT 
 
 
 
 
 
MUHAMMAD RAZA QURESHI, J. Since the instant Revision 
Petition as well as connected petition bearing No. 15217 of 2023 
emanate from consolidated Judgments and Decrees (hereinafter 
referred to as the “Impugned Judgments and Decrees”) and 
agitate similar questions of law as well as facts, therefore, they are 
decided together. 
2. 
Through these Civil Revisions under Section 115 of the 
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (the “CPC”), the Petitioner has 
called into question the validity and legality of findings contained 
in the Impugned Judgments and Decrees dated 29.06.2022 and 
07.02.2023. Pursuant to the Impugned Judgment and Decree 
passed by the Trial Court, counter suits filed by the parties seeking 
specific performance of agreement to sell and cancellation of said 
agreement to sell were dismissed. However, through the Impugned 
Judgment and Decree dated 07.02.2023 rendered by the Appellate 
Court, the Judgment and Decree passed in suit for specific 
performance of agreement to sell filed by the Petitioner was 
maintained, whereas the Judgment and Decree passed by the Trial 
Court in the suit filed by the Respondent seeking cancellation of 
subject matter agreement to sell was reversed and the suit filed by 
the Respondent was decreed. 
Date of Hearing 
08.05.2023 
Petitioner by: 
Mr. Muhammad Sarwar Qamar, Advocate. 
Respondent by: 
Mr. Pervaiz Akhtar Tahir, Advocate.

3. 
Learned counsel for the Petitioner submits that the 
Impugned Judgments and Decrees are illegal and unlawful and 
both the Courts below while passing the same have committed 
material irregularity. According to learned counsel, since the 
subject matter agreement to sell was an admitted document, 
therefore, there was no occasion for the Trial Court to dismiss 
Petitioner’s suit on the ground that Petitioner failed to produce 
original agreement to sell and also failed to prove the same in 
terms of Articles 17 and 79 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 
(hereinafter referred to as the “Order”). According to learned 
counsel, to the extent of findings contained in Impugned Judgment 
and Decree passed by the Appellate Court on issue No.3, it 
misread the evidence by holding that Petitioner was liable to pay 
rent to the Respondent for the subject matter property. Lastly, 
contends that the Impugned Judgments and Decrees are nullity in 
the eyes of law, hence are liable to be set aside. 
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the Respondent while 
supporting the Impugned Judgment and Decree passed by the 
Appellate Court contends that the Appellate Court followed the 
cannons of justice and rightly adjudicated the matter in view of 
pleadings respectively canvassed by the parties and documentary 
as well as oral evidence. According to learned counsel, the 
findings contained in the Impugned Judgments and Decrees 
passed to the extent they are concurrent cannot be evaluated by 
this Court in exercise of supervisory jurisdiction as Courts below 
while passing the same neither misread the evidence nor failed to 
appreciate the material on record. Pursuant to query posed by this 
Court with respect to findings on issue No. 3 recorded in 
Judgment and Decree passed by the Appellate Court, learned 
counsel concedes factual as well as legal position. 
5. 
Arguments of learned counsel for the parties have been 
heard and record has been perused with their able assistance. At 
the outset, it is observed that the contention of the Petitioner that 
subject matter agreement to sell was an admitted document is 

-3- 
                 Civil Revisions No.15213 & 15217 of 2023 
 
 
inherently flawed and factually incorrect as the contents of written 
statement filed by the Respondent clearly reflects that though 
Respondent conceded the existence of the subject matter 
agreement to sell, but alleged an interpolation with respect to date 
contained therein and categorically pleaded that the subject matter 
agreement to sell was forged one and date mentioned therein as 
10.12.2012 was interposed  by writing as 10.12.2014, therefore, in 
such scenario, it cannot be accepted that the subject matter 
agreement to sell was an admitted document. It was obligatory for 
the Petitioner to produce the original document and in case the 
Petitioner contended that original agreement to sell was with the 
Respondent, it was his responsibility to follow the mandate 
contained in provisions of Article 76 of the Order with respect to 
production of secondary evidence. The failure of the Petitioner to 
serve notice to produce or admit and deny the subject matter 
agreement to sell under Order XII of the CPC, has serious 
consequence under the law and one of the fundamental 
consequences thereof, is that without following the mandate of 
law he was debarred to produce secondary evidence. This is the 
primary justification and rightly so prevailing with the Trial Court 
while dismissing the suit for specific performance of agreement to 
sell. 
6. 
Likewise, though the Petitioner in paragraph No.3 of his 
Suit categorically pleaded his readiness and willingness to perform 
his part of agreement to sell, yet he throughout failed to satisfy the 
test of law, wherein to substantiate his bona fide claim, the 
Petitioner should have filed an Application with the Trial Court 
for depositing the balance sale consideration. Thus, the findings of 
the Trial Court with respect to silence of the Petitioner to 
substantiate his readiness and willingness cannot be interfered. 
7. 
It is evident from the subject matter agreement to sell that it 
bears names of two marginal witnesses, namely, Nasir Hussain 
and Sana Ullah. The Petitioner has conceded before this Court that 
only witness who appeared before the Court was Nasir Hussain 

-4- 
                 Civil Revisions No.15213 & 15217 of 2023 
 
 
(DW-2), but the other witness Sana Ullah could not be produced 
as he had already died. In case the said witness had passed away, 
then the Petitioner was under an obligation to prove his death and 
prove through secondary evidence the elements such as 
comparison of signatures and thumb impressions with admitted 
thumb impressions and signatures on other documents and he was 
required to prove signatures or thumb impressions of dead person 
through identification of his signatures from any one of his 
relatives like son, brother, etc. Mere statement of the Plaintiff 
regarding death of a witness does not alleviate or exonerate him to 
prove the contents of a disputed document. These facts should 
have been pleaded and having established the non-availability of 
the witness by reason of his death, steps should have been taken to 
adduce secondary evidence with the leave of the Court.  Reliance 
in this regard is placed upon the judgments reported as Anwar 
Ahmad vs. Mst. Nafis Banno through Legal Heirs (2005 SCMR 
152), Sheikh Muhammad Muneer vs. Mst. Feezan (PLD 2021 SC 
538), Mst. Kausar Bibi vs. Muhammad Sarwar and others (2022 
YLR 1028) and City Education Board (Registered) Sialkot 
through Director vs. Mst. Maqbool Nasreen (PLD 2008 Lahore 
51). 
8. 
In the instant case, the Petitioner did not make any effort to 
prove the alleged agreement to sell through the mode prescribed 
under the Order. This Court concurs with the findings contained in 
the Impugned Judgments and Decrees, as to the proof of the 
subject matter agreement to sell which was mandatory, especially, 
when there was an allegation of interpolation in the contents of 
said agreement to sell and the Petitioner in the course of evidence 
failed to prove transaction satisfying the tests laid down by the 
provisions of Articles 17 and 79 of the Order.  
9. 
The findings contained in the Impugned Judgments and 
Decrees dismissing the suit for specific performance of agreement 
to sell do not warrant any interference and this case is classic 
example of law laid down by the Supreme Court of Pakistan, 

-5- 
                 Civil Revisions No.15213 & 15217 of 2023 
 
 
wherein it has been held that concurrent findings of facts cannot 
be interfered with, especially, if the wishful thinking of the 
Petitioner expects a different conclusion on facts than the one 
arrived at by courts below. Reliance in this respect is placed on the 
Judgments reported as Amjad Khan versus Muhammad Irshad 
(deceased) through L.Rs (2020 SCMR 2155) and Shajar Islam 
versus Muhammad Siddique and 2 others (PLD 2007 Supreme 
Court 45) 
10. 
So far as the findings of the Appellate Court contained in 
issue No.3 are concerned, it is held that those findings could not 
have been arrived at in view of order dated 10.03.2021 passed by 
the learned Special Judge (Rent), Faisalabad, wherein the 
ejectment petition and claim in respect thereof agitated by the 
Respondent was dismissed for non-prosecution and this error has 
also been conceded to by learned counsel for the Respondent, 
therefore, the findings of Appellate Court to the extent of decision 
on issue No.3 are  set aside. 
11. 
The findings of the Appellate Court with respect to 
decreeing the suit for cancellation of agreement to sell filed by the 
Respondent, this Court is convinced that there was sufficient 
material in the oral as well as documentary evidence available 
with the Appellate Court to vary with the Judgment and  Decree 
passed by the Trial Court as it is settled law that in case of 
difference of opinion in the Judgments and Decrees passed by the 
trial court and the appellate court, the view expressed by the latter 
shall be given preference and weightage. Reliance in this regard is 
placed on the Judgments reported as   Madan Gopal and 4 others 
Vs. Maran Bepari and 3 others (PLD 1969 SC 617), Muhammad 
Nawaz through LRs. Vs. Haji Muhammad Baran Khan through 
LRs and others (2013 SCMR 1300), Amjad Ikram Vs. Mst. Asya 
Kausar and 2 others (2015 SCMR 1) & Muhammad Yasin 
through L.Rs. and others vs. Muhammad Latif and others (2016 
CLC 553).

12. 
Despite hectic efforts of the learned counsel for the 
Petitioner, this Court is not persuaded that findings contained in 
the Impugned Judgments and  Decrees passed by learned Courts 
below suffer from any material illegality or are tainted with any 
material irregularity. Consequently, the same are maintained and 
both the Civil Revisions are dismissed.
