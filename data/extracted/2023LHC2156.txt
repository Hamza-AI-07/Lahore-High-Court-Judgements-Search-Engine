ABID AZIZ SHEIKH, J.  This judgment will also 
decide Election Appeals Nos. 24499 of 2023 and 24500 of 2023  as all 
these appeals are against the similar impugned orders passed by the 
Returning Officer accepting the nomination papers of Muhammad 
Yaqoob Sheikh respondent No.2 (hereinafter referred to as 
respondent) regarding PP-126, Jhang-III. 
2. 
Relevant facts are that the respondent filed nomination 
papers to contest Punjab Provincial Assembly election from PP-126, 
Jhang-III. The appellants in all these appeals filed objections on the 

Election Appeal No.24497 of 2023                                                      (2) 
 
 
 
nomination papers, however, through separate orders of even date i.e. 
22.03.2023, the objections were dismissed and nomination papers of 
the respondent were accepted. The appellants, being aggrieved, have 
filed these three separate Election appeals under Section 63 of the 
Elections Act, 2017 (Act). 
3. 
Learned counsel for the appellants in Election Appeal 
Nos.24497 of 2023 and 24499 of 2023 submits that as per the State 
Bank of Pakistan’s report dated 16.03.2023, there is not only huge 
outstanding liability but certain amounts were also written off by a 
company namely M/s Husnain Cotex Limited (HCL) from various 
financial institutions. He submits that the respondent being the 
majority shareholder of HCL was not only required to disclose the 
said liability and but also disqualified for failure to pay the said 
liability and written off loan. He further submits that the loan amount 
was obtained and written off by another company namely M/s Ibrahim 
(Pvt.) Limited (IPL) and the respondent being majority shareholder of 
the said company in the year 2013, will be liable for the default, hence 
disqualified under Article 62(1)(n) of the Constitution of  Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (Constitution). He submits that the wife 
of the respondent (namely Mrs. Kousar Yaqoob) owned 10,000 shares 
of IPL but said shares are not disclosed in the statement of assets and 
liability in Form-B as required under section 60(2)(d) of the Act and 
therefore the respondent is disqualified under Section 60(9)(c) of the 
Act. He placed reliance on “Tariq Mehmood Murtaza Versus 
Returning Officer PP-2, Rawalpindi” (2014 CLC 94) and “Muzafar 

Election Appeal No.24497 of 2023                                                      (3) 
 
 
 
Abbas Versus Maulana Muhammad Ahmad Ludhianvi and 31 others” 
(PLD 2017 Lahore 394). 
4. 
The appellant in Election Appeal No.24500 of 2023 
appeared in person and submits that as per the judgment of the 
Election Tribunal dated 14.01.2016, the second wife of the respondent 
(Mst. Rashida Yaqoob) was de-seated from being member of 
Provincial Assembly and she had to return the pay and privileges 
received by her as member of Provincial Assembly. Submits that the 
said liability of spouse has neither been disclosed in the nomination 
papers nor the same has been cleared by the respondent, hence he is 
disqualified under Article 63(1)(o) of the Constitution. He further 
reiterated the grounds urged in other connected appeals already 
recorded above.  
5. 
Learned counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, 
submits that the respondent is only 14% shareholder of HCL whereas 
he has no shareholding at all in IPL, hence neither liable to disclose 
nor pay off the liabilities of these companies. Adds that in any case 
liability on behalf of the said companies has already been settled. He 
further submits that as there is no determination and demand for the 
return of pay and privileges received by his wife (Rashida Yaqoob) 
from the concerned authorities therefore the same does not amount to 
“Government dues”. He submits that no doubt the wife of the 
respondent (Mst. Kousar Yaqoob) owned 10,000 shares, out of total 
five million shares of IPL but same inadvertently could not be 
mentioned in the statement of assets but this being an unintentional 

Election Appeal No.24497 of 2023                                                      (4) 
 
 
 
bonafide error and also being not material and substantial in nature, 
can be condoned/rectified and may not be a sole ground to deprive the 
respondent from his fundamental right to contest the election. 
6. 
Arguments heard and record perused. Regarding the 
outstanding liability against HCL and IPL, it is admitted position on 
record that the respondent is only 14.09% shareholder of HCL 
whereas he has no shareholding in IPL, therefore, the afore-said 
companies being independent legal entity, their liability cannot be 
attributable to the respondent for purpose of disqualification under 
Article 62(1)(n) of the Constitution. The respondent was also not 
required to disclose the said companies in Clause-E of the affidavit, as 
said companies are admittedly not mainly owned by the respondent. 
The  record also shows that august Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
earlier round of litigation already turned down the aforesaid objection 
on the basis of default of HCL and IPL and accepted the nomination 
papers of the respondent vide judgment dated 19.01.2021 (in Civil 
Appeal No.3673 of 2018), therefore this plea cannot be agitated again. 
7. 
The next objection of the appellant is that 10,000 shares of 
IPL are owned by wife of respondent (Mst. Kausar Yaqoob) but same 
have not been disclosed in statement, hence his nomination papers are 
liable to be rejected. To adjudicate this ground, it is necessary to 
examine the relevant provisions of the Act i.e. section 60(2)(d), 
section 62(9)(c) and clause (ii) of proviso to section 62(9) of the Act, 
which are reproduced hereunder:- 
 

Election Appeal No.24497 of 2023                                                      (5) 
 
 
 
 
60. Nomination for election.— 
(2) Every nomination shall be made by a separate 
nomination paper on Form A signed both by the proposer 
and the seconder and shall, on solemn affirmation made and 
signed by the candidate, be accompanied by— 
(d) a statement of his assets and liabilities and of his spouse 
and dependent children as on the preceding thirtieth day of 
June on Form B. 
 
62. Scrutiny.— 
(9) Subject to this section, the Returning Officer may, on 
either of his own motion or upon an objection, conduct a 
summary enquiry and may reject a nomination paper if he is 
satisfied that— 
 
(c) any provision of section 60 or section 61 has not been 
complied with or the candidate has submitted a declaration 
or statement which is false or incorrect in any material 
particular; or 
 
 
Clause (ii) of proviso to section 62(9) 
Provided that  
(ii) the Returning Officer shall not reject a nomination paper 
on the ground of any defect which is not of a substantial 
nature and may allow any such defect to be remedied 
forthwith, including an error in regard to the name, serial 
number in the electoral roll or other particulars of the 
candidate or his proposer or seconder so as to bring them in 
conformity with the corresponding entries in the electoral 
roll. 
 
 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
8. 
Plain reading of aforesaid provisions show that under 
section 60(2)(d) of the Act, the candidate is required to furnish 
statement of assets and liabilities of candidate, his spouse and 
dependent children. Under section 62(9)(c) of the Act, nomination 
papers may be rejected, if statement is false or incorrect in any 
material particular. However under clause (ii) of proviso to section 
62(9) of the Act, nomination papers shall not be rejected on the 
ground of any defect, which is not of substantial nature. Indeed under 

Election Appeal No.24497 of 2023                                                      (6) 
 
 
 
section 62(9)(c) of the Act, the Returning Officer may reject the 
nomination papers if he is satisfied that statement is false or incorrect 
in any material particular. However, omission in the statement of 
assets and liabilities of candidate himself or his dependent children, 
cannot be equated or treated at par with the omission of assets and 
liabilities of his spouse/wife. There is no law under which the wife is 
obliged to disclose all her assets and liabilities to husband and 
similarly there is no enactment under which husband can 
compel/force the wife to inform him about all her assets and 
liabilities. The spouse (in this case wife) is an independent person 
with all fundamental rights granted under the Constitution, including 
right of privacy and she may not want to disclose all her assets and 
liabilities to husband, specifically those not acquired through him or 
not directly related to her husband. Even if the assets were originally 
acquired by wife through husband, she is not obliged under law to 
inform him before further transferring/alienating of those assets. 
Therefore, any omission of assets/liabilities in the statement regarding 
assets/liabilities of spouse/wife may not be alike or of same gravity as 
of omission in respect of assets and liabilities of the candidate himself 
or the one acquired by him for his dependent children. In case of 
incorrect and false statement of candidate’s own or his dependent 
children’s assets/liabilities the same may be fatal but in case of 
statement regarding assets/liabilities of wife/spouse, the omission may 
not be fatal unless same is not bonafide and some undue 
benefit/purpose was achieved or likely to be achieved by candidate for 

Election Appeal No.24497 of 2023                                                      (7) 
 
 
 
making such incorrect and false statement. The words “may” 
“material particular” in section 62(9)(c) of the Act and words 
“substantial nature” in clause (ii) of proviso to section 62(9) of the Act 
also support the above  explicit intention of the legislation.  
9. 
The present case when examined in above context, it is 
noted that the 10,000 shares of IPL were owned by wife of the 
respondent (Mrs. Kausar Yaqoob) as per Form “A” submitted with 
Security and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) in year 2013. 
The respondent was also shareholder of IPL but he sold/transferred his 
shares in October 2013 and since then the respondent is neither 
shareholder of said company nor he has any access to the 
documents/shareholding of the IPL. He is also not legally supposed to 
know if those 10,000 shares owned by his wife/spouse in year 2013 
are still in her name or alienated by her. The total shareholding of IPL  
is 5,00,000 and wife of respondent was owning only 10,000 (2%) 
shareholding, which is not even a significant shareholding what to say 
of majority shareholding. It is not shown that what benefit even 
remote is likely to be obtained by the respondent by withholding said 
information in the statement especially when the shareholding of his 
wife has been disclosed to the SECP regularly in Form “A”, to which 
however the respondent has no legal access, being not the shareholder 
of company/IPL. 
10. 
The Hon’ble Supreme Court in “Malik Shakeel Awan Versus 
Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed and 21 others” (PLD 2018 Supreme Court 
643) allowed the correction in the land holding of the candidate on the 

Election Appeal No.24497 of 2023                                                      (8) 
 
 
 
ground that nondisclosure or mis-declaration will not give any 
advantage to the candidate, hence does not amount to mis-declaration.  
The August Supreme Court of Pakistan in “Khawaja Muhammad Asif 
Versus Muhammad Usman Dar and others” (2018 SCMR 2128) 
while interpreting Section 13(3)(d) of the Representation of the 
People Act, 1976 (ROPA) (since repealed), which was an identical 
provision as of Section 60(2)(d) of the Act, held that mere omission to 
list an asset cannot be labeled as done dishonestly unless some 
wrongdoing is associated with its acquisition or retention, which is 
duly established in judicial proceedings. The same view was also 
expressed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in “Shamona 
Badshah Qaisarani Versus Election Tribunal, Multan and others” 
(2021 SCMR 988). The case law relied upon by learned counsel for 
the appellants is distinguishable and not applicable to facts and 
circumstances of this case. 
11. 
 
In view of the above discussion, the omission on part of 
the respondent to mention 10,000 shares of his wife in IPL is neither 
of material particular or of substantial nature nor amounts to incorrect 
or false statement for the purpose of Section 62(9)(c) of the Act. The 
same being a curable omission cannot be sole ground to reject the 
nomination papers of the respondent.  
12. 
The argument of the appellant is that pay and privileges 
received by wife of the respondent as member of Provincial Assembly 
has not been paid back as directed by learned Election Tribunal, hence 
amount to default of “Government dues” under Article 62(1)(o) of the 

Election Appeal No.24497 of 2023                                                      (9) 
 
 
 
Constitution. In this regard, suffice it to note that though the learned 
Election Tribunal passed the order dated 14.01.2016 for return of pay 
and privileges by wife of the respondent, however, admittedly till date 
neither any determination has been made by the concerned authorities 
regarding the exact amount of outstanding dues nor any demand 
notice has been issued to the wife of the respondent for said amount. 
The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in “Khawaja Muhammad 
Asif Versus Muhammad Usman Dar and others” (2018 SCMR 2128) 
held that default for purpose of disqualification of candidate can only 
be establish, if it is shown that a demand notice was issued by the 
authority who is competent to recover the “Government dues” and yet 
the same remained unpaid. It is also held that unless the said demand 
is raised, the amount does not constitute the “Government dues” to 
disqualify the candidate. It is also relevant to note that the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court in “Dr. Ahmed Ali Shah Versus Syed Mehmood Akhtar 
Naqvi and others” (2018 SCMR 1276) even otherwise held that the 
order for return of salaries and pre-requisites is very harsh.  
13. 
In view of above discussion, the impugned orders are 
sustained and all three appeals being meritless are dismissed.
