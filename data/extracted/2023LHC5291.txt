Murder Reference in, and appeal against conviction & acquittal passed in, 
judgment dated 03.04.2019 handed down by learned Additional Sessions Judge, 
Multan in case FIR No. 70/18 dated 02.02.2018 u/s 302/34 PPC, P/S 
Mumtazabad, Multan whereby Sajid Hussain accused was convicted u/s 302(b) 
PPC and sentenced to death as ta’zir and ordered to pay compensation of  
Rs. 200,000/- to the legal heirs of deceased, for default to undergo SI for six 
months, and Tahir Imam co-accused was acquitted. 
                                                                                        
Muhammad Amjad Rafiq, J:- Prosecution case theory 
presented a woman as host, for marriage arrangements of her 
daughter, who while responding to a knock at the door of her house in 
wee hours of the morning tasted her death at the hands of a boy who 
was aspirant to marry her daughter. It was claimed an intentional 
murder committed by Sajid Hussain/appellant by a pistol fire shot 
when in the company of co-accused Tahir Imam (since acquitted). 
Defence negated the theory by labeling it a motive-less blind murder 
and involvement of accused due to party faction.  
2.   The factual matrix in legal context collected through FIR and 
evidence of parties viewed the happening of occurrence on 

                        Murder Reference No. 45 of 2019 
                        Crl. Appeal No. 289-J of 2019 
                        Crl. Appeal No. 457 of 2019                                                                                      2 
 
02.02.2018 at 6:50 a.m. prior to sun arise when Shamim Bibi wife of 
complainant Muhammad Saleem (PW-9) responded to a knock at the 
door after hearing voice of someone asking for drop of axillaries for 
marriage; when she opened the main gate, Sajid Hussain/appellant 
fired a pistol shot hitting on the left side of her chest and she fell 
down; co-accused also made one fire hitting at the main gate. 
Occurrence was viewed by her husband Malik Muhammad Saleem, 
PW-9 (complainant), her brother Muhammad Amjad, PW-10 and 
other witnesses, allegedly sitting in TV lounge reportedly facing 
garage of the house; both accused succeeded to decamp by riding on 
motorcycle despite a catch-effort by PWs. Motive was annoyance of 
Sajid Hussain/appellant over his rejection for marriage with Nadia 
Saleem, daughter of the complainant.  
3.     Matter was reported to the police at 11:10 a.m. on the same day 
with a delay of more than four hours with the justification that time 
was consumed while shifting Shamim Bibi in injured condition to 
hospital and on the way when she died, her deadbody was kept at 
Nishtar Hospital Multan and police on receiving information reached 
there. These four hours are very crucial to decide the fate of first 
phase of prosecution reel. PW-9 states that his son informed the 
Rescue 1122 Emergency Ambulance Service and it reached at 7:00 
a.m. and according to him “we had shifted the dead body at 7:15 
a.m.”. If Shamim Bibi had died, there was no question of shifting her 
to hospital in injured condition, and this fact is also mentioned in a 
report of Emergency Service 1122 available in the file that on 
02.02.2018 at 7:03 a.m., when they reached at the place of occurrence, 
woman had died. Therefore, there was no occasion for complainant to 
wait further for a moment to report the matter to the police.  
          However, let’s move forward with the story of prosecution. 
Complainant stated that he along with witnesses while accompanying 
Shamim Bibi reached the hospital within 20 to 25 minutes, whereas 
PW-10 Muhammad Amjad deposed that ambulance 1122 took only 

                        Murder Reference No. 45 of 2019 
                        Crl. Appeal No. 289-J of 2019 
                        Crl. Appeal No. 457 of 2019                                                                                      3 
 
Saleem (complainant) and Shamim Bibi to hospital. Further deposed 
that when he had left for hospital, he received information about death 
of her sister and he reached the hospital within 15 minutes. With this 
contradiction, complainant further ran the story that police reached the 
hospital at 10:30 or 10:45 a.m., and he had already got dictated an 
application for registration of case through a relative whose name he 
did not disclose. PW-11 Noor Akbar SI confirmed this fact that he 
received information about the occurrence at 10:20 a.m. and reached 
the Emergency ward of Nishtar Hospital where complainant handed 
over him the written application for registration of FIR which the 
complainant signed in his presence. Though drafting style of such 
application Ex. PH was highly professional which is not expected to 
be written by a layman, yet leaving this aspect aside, it was observed 
that during cross examination, Noor Akbar SI, investigating officer 
(PW-11) conceded that after receiving the formal FIR, he prepared 
inquest report that obviously was showing inspection of deadbody at 
that time and further deposed that he handed over the deadbody to 
Naila Naheed, lady constable, who never appeared as a witness during 
the trial. It was 12:00 noon when postmortem on deadbody was 
conducted and PW-9 (complainant), investigating officer (PW-11) and 
doctor (PW-6) were unanimous that deadbody was brought by Asif 
Abrar 4901/C (PW-5) instead of Naila Naheed, Lady Constable. A 
report of Nishtar Hospital is available on the record at page 125 of 
case bundle showing deposit of deadbody of Shamim Bibi in the 
morgue at 9:20 a.m. on 02.02.2018 by Asif Abrar 4901/C and it was 
received back by him at 11:30 a.m. on the same day for postmortem 
and later during the day it was handed over to Muhammad Akram, 
brother of the complainant (a given-up eye witness). Presence of Asif 
Abrar in hospital prior to reaching of investigating officer throws 
suspicion that occurrence was in the knowledge of police from very 
early hours and due to absence of complainant, the registration of FIR 
was delayed and by the time postmortem was got conducted; that was 
the reason instead of complainant, his brother Akram received the 

                        Murder Reference No. 45 of 2019 
                        Crl. Appeal No. 289-J of 2019 
                        Crl. Appeal No. 457 of 2019                                                                                      4 
 
deadbody and later was given up to hide the facts that might have 
been caught during his cross examination. Absence of complainant 
gets further strength from the statement of PW-9 (complainant) who 
concede that he had two wives, one living in Qasba Maral at a 
distance of 30/40 kilometer from the place of occurrence. We have 
also observed that had the FIR been registered before the postmortem, 
the inquest report must have contained the FIR number, which is not 
there. In this way we can simply hold that complainant was not 
present at the place of occurrence, therefore, his testimony cannot be 
relied upon as trustworthy. Reliance is placed on the cases reported          
as ZAFAR HAYAT versus THE STATE, (1995 SCMR 896); 
MUHAMMAD RAFIQUE versus THE STATE and another, (2004 
SCMR 755) and MST. SUGHRA BEGUM  and 
another 
versus  
QAISER PERVEZ and others, (2015 SCMR 1142). 
4.       Before dilating further upon the presence of PWs at the place of 
occurrence, it is necessary to see what the investigating officer has 
done at the crime scene.  He collected two crime empties, prepared 
visual site plane, secured blood on a cotton; got prepared one snap of 
deadbody and three snaps of place of occurrence through Mubashir 
2587/C PW-1; recorded statement of witnesses and later received last 
worn clothes of the deceased, i.e., blood-stained shirt, but no mention 
of shalwar and dupatta being blood stained; doctor has also explained 
the similar description of such clothes as well as Asif Abrar, PW-5 
which shows that due to injury on the chest only shirt was soaked with 
blood. Such clothes though were sent to PFSA along with blood on 
cotton, yet no PW deposed about this fact who actually had deposited 
such articles in the PFSA and for what purpose. We have examined 
the PFSA report consist of two pages Ex. PQ & PQ/1 which 
surprisingly shows that all three clothes were blood stained, and DNA 
profile obtained from these clothes was consistent with a single source 
of female origin but to our further surprise the  DNA  profile  obtained 

                        Murder Reference No. 45 of 2019 
                        Crl. Appeal No. 289-J of 2019 
                        Crl. Appeal No. 457 of 2019                                                                                      5 
 
from blood on cotton was mixture of at least two individuals and the 
source of DNA obtained from clothes was eliminated as being the 
possible contributor to the DNA obtained from blood on cotton. This 
was so shocking for us that the DNA on clothes did not match with 
DNA obtained from blood on cotton, which was secured from the 
place of occurrence. Thus, it was a clear indication that place of 
occurrence was doubtful.   
5.   With this information when we examined the snap (P/1) of 
deadbody, the investigating officer did not opt for whole view of the 
body of deceased showing blood on her clothes rather it was a capture 
of only face of deceased with red lipstick on her lips, similar 
description was also observed and deposed by the doctor through her 
postmortem report as well as her deposition before the Court. This 
was an eye brow raising fact for us that how a woman at 6:50 a.m. in 
the month of February, 2018 when the sun has not arisen could be in 
such a polished condition of make-up, particularly when the doctor 
has observed during postmortem that her bladder was full of urine and 
shalwar was not blood-stained, though shirt was drenched with blood. 
It gives us an impression that probably she was killed at the time 
when she was sleeping or if not, but for sure, just a moment later she 
got out of dormancy. We made up this observation under the 
impression that the occurrence has not been committed in the manner 
as being claimed by the prosecution. In this respect we have examined 
the evidence explaining the place of occurrence. There were two doors 
of house, i.e., main gate with width of around 8 feet, and a little gate 
of about 2 and half feet and behind that gate there was a large garage 
and after that acclaimed TV lounge which we did not find in the site 
plan. Witnesses were claiming to have their seat in TV lounge which 
is not visible from the main gate yet their position in the site plan was 
shown inside the garage. On knock, no male member opted to go out 
to attend the calling by the accused; though husband, brother and 
Dewar (husband’s brother) were amongst the witnesses. However, 

                        Murder Reference No. 45 of 2019 
                        Crl. Appeal No. 289-J of 2019 
                        Crl. Appeal No. 457 of 2019                                                                                      6 
 
considering that it was Shamim Bibi who opened the gate, but it was 
not expected that she should have exposed her to the accused through 
main gate of 8 feet (which is the case of prosecution) rather in normal 
course she would have opened the little gate; that was the reason  PW-
9 & PW-10 have given different description of width of gate while 
viewing the accused in a situation when he fired at Shamim Bibi. PW-
9 stated during cross examination as under:-  
                                           “The deceased was standing at the door, which is 8-feet in width” 
 
                     Whereas PW-10 stated as under: - 
                                             “The outer door was 2/2-1/2 feet in width.” 
 
According to site plan accused were standing in front of main gate and 
witnesses were sitting a little right inside behind the main gate, but the 
little gate was away from them; therefore, if the accused were present 
at the little gate, witnesses could not view them while firing at 
deceased, similarly their position in site plan also do not make them 
capable to see the act of firing even at the main gate. this anomaly 
shows that at the time of occurrence either PW-9 was not present or 
the PW-10 because while attending the above contradiction of 
witnesses with respect to width of gate, we have observed that PW-9 
stated during cross examination that “the witnesses had come to my 
house in the evening prior to the occurrence”; whereas Muhammad 
Amjad PW-10 stated that his house is at a distance of 06/07 acre away 
from the house of complainant and “I reached at the house of my 
brother in law/complainant at the time of Fajar prayer”. Even there 
is contradiction with respect to their own distance from the deceased; 
according to PW-10, they were sitting at a distance of 10 feet from the 
outer door, whereas PW-9 stated that all the relatives including 
witnesses were sitting in TV lounge which is at a distance of 04/05 
feet away from the outer door. We are of the firm opinion that 
witnesses were not present at the place of occurrence and the reason 
advanced by them i.e., marriage of Nadia Saleem, for their presence is 
not supported with any article available in the house of complainant 

                        Murder Reference No. 45 of 2019 
                        Crl. Appeal No. 289-J of 2019 
                        Crl. Appeal No. 457 of 2019                                                                                      7 
 
showing that it was a house with marriage function. So much so Nadia 
Saleem whose statement was claimed to have been recorded by the 
investigating officer PW-11, did not appear in the dock.  
6.   Prosecution through snaps P/2-4 of crime scene tried to show that 
bullet mark is available on the main gate and it be read in favour of 
prosecution story that fire by co-accused hit at the gate. Examination 
of one of the snaps shows that it was a mark inside the door of main 
gate otherwise in a normal course it should have been from the outer 
side; however, in both situations, investigating officer must have 
searched for led of bullet which hit the main gate but it was not found. 
Further, when it was opted by the investigating officer to take snaps of 
crime scene, the view should have encompassed all the material 
points, like TV lounge, place where crime empties were available and 
whole view of blood trail, article available in the house showing 
marriage function; but it has not been done; therefore, this deliberate 
lacuna creates a strong presumption that investigating officer was 
trying to hide something detrimental and devastating to prosecution 
case theory. Investigating officer as well as draftsman did not use their 
skills while drafting the site plans to throw light on the clear situation 
of crime scene which was a deliberate deviation from their lawful 
duty. A site plan is required to be prepared by a qualified police 
officer or other suitable agency or patwari, but if it is an inhabited 
enclosure or of land inside a town or village site, the site plan shall not 
be prepared by Patwaris. The requirement of site plan in law is 
referred in Rule 25.13 of Police Rules, 1934 which is reproduced as 
under:- 
25.13. Plan of scene. (1) In all important cases two plans of the scene of 
the offences shall be prepared by a qualified police officer or other 
suitable agency one to be submitted with the charge sheet or final report 
and the other to be retained for departmental use.  
(2) The following rules shall govern the preparation of maps or plans by 
patwaris or other expert: -  
(i) Pursuant to paragraph 26 of the Patwari Rules, the Financial 
Commissioner, with the concurrence of the Inspector General of Police, 

                        Murder Reference No. 45 of 2019 
                        Crl. Appeal No. 289-J of 2019 
                        Crl. Appeal No. 457 of 2019                                                                                      8 
 
issues the following instructions concerning the preparation by patwaris 
of maps needed to illustrate police inquiries.  
(ii) In ordinary cases no demands for such maps will be made upon 
patwaris.  
(iii) In the case of heinous crime, especially in cases of murder or riots 
connected with land disputes, the police officer investigating the case 
will, if he considers an accurate map is required, summons to the scene 
of the crime the patwari of the circle in which it occurred and cause him 
to prepare two maps, one for production in court as evidence and the 
other for the use of the police investigating agency. In the former 
reference relating to facts observed by the police officer should be 
entered while in the latter references based on the statement of witnesses 
which are not relevant in evidence may be recorded. He will be careful 
not to detain the patwaris longer than is necessary for the preparation of 
maps.  
(iv) It is necessary to define clearly the responsibility of the patwari and 
police officer in respect of these maps.  
(v) The police officer will indicate to the patwari the limits of the land of 
which he desires map, and the topographical items to be shown therein. 
The patwari will then be responsible for drawing the maps correctly, by 
tracing, if necessary, the second copy, for making accurately on maps all 
these items and for entering on the maps due distances. He will not write 
on the map, intended for production as evidence in the court any 
explanations. The police officer may write any explanations on the 
traced copy of the map.  
(vi) It is for the police officer himself to add to the second copy of the 
map such remarks as may be necessary to explain the connection of the 
map with the case under inquiry. He is also responsible equally with the 
patwaris for the correctness of all distances, but on the copy of the map 
drawn by the patwari for presentation, in court he will make no remarks 
or explanations based on the statements of witnesses.  
(vii) It will be convenient if all the entries made by the patwari are made 
in black ink, and those added by the police officer in red ink.  
(viii) Patwaris will not in any case be required by a police officer to 
make a map of an inhabited enclosure or of land inside a town or village 
site. 
The underlined text above showing importance and necessity of 
drafting a map or site plan correctly. However, requirement of 
preparing two site plans shows that in the first plan, reference relating 
to facts observed by the police officer should be entered while in the 
latter, references based on the statement of witnesses which are not 
relevant in evidence may be recorded. Thus, the law requires that one 
site plan prepared by the police officer or expert shall be on the basis 
of their own observation of crime scene and second shall include 
some facts based on the statement of witnesses to show connection of 

                        Murder Reference No. 45 of 2019 
                        Crl. Appeal No. 289-J of 2019 
                        Crl. Appeal No. 457 of 2019                                                                                      9 
 
this site plan with the case under inquiry and this second site plan 
shall not be sent to the court but can help the investigating officer to 
refresh his memory when appearing in the dock to depose as witness. 
We have observed that both expert or the investigating officer have 
failed to perform their duty to prepare the site plan accurately which is 
a violation of sub-rule (v) above.  
7.     Prosecution has claimed that recovery of pistol from the 
appellant is supportive to prosecution case because one of the empties 
collected from the place of occurrence was reported by PFSA as 
having been found fired from the pistol recovered on the lead of 
appellant. It has been observed that similar evidence of matching 
report against the co-accused Tahir Imam has been discarded by the 
learned trial court while acquitting him. We have further observed that 
Noor Akbar SI PW-11 was the man who deposited the empties and 
pistol in the office of PFSA, though fact of depositing of empties on 
07.20.2018 is available in his statement as well as in the statement of 
Moharrir PW-4 but he did not depose about the fact of depositing the 
pistols rather stated that he recorded the statement of Moharrir for 
depositing of pistols before PFSA. In normal circumstances, it may be 
considered an innocent omission but we have observed that two 
pistols were received by PFSA in two separate parcels but Moharrir 
Nazar Hussain PW-4 deposed during cross examination that both 
pistols were sealed in one parcel which is a dent in recovery of pistols 
and transmission of that very pistol which was allegedly stood 
recovered from the appellant. Even pistols after recovery were handed 
over to the Moharrir on 15.02.2018 but they were deposited in PFSA 
with further delay of 8 days on 23.02.2018. therefore, recovery of 
pistol from the appellant has become doubtful.  
8.     Medical evidence for the prosecution was materialized through 
postmortem of deceased which was conducted by Dr. Meraj Fatima 
PW-6 at 12.00 (noon) on 02.02.2018 with a delay of 5 hours and 
observed following injuries:- 

                        Murder Reference No. 45 of 2019 
                        Crl. Appeal No. 289-J of 2019 
                        Crl. Appeal No. 457 of 2019                                                                                      10 
 
Injury No.1); Lacerated wound measuring 03 x 04 cm over the front of left side 
of the chest 6 cm left nipple. The wound was having tattooing around (3-5 cm). 
The wound was having abraded collar and inverted margins; 
1-A (wound of exit): Lacerated wound of 01cm x ¾ cm with everted margins on 
right side of chest below 05cm inferior angle of right scapula. 
 
From the above observation of doctor, it seems that injury entered 
from left side of chest and exited from right side of chest, but 
mentioning the words “below 5 cm inferior angle of right scapula” 
shows that the exit wound was on the back of chest, that was the 
reason in pictorial diagram, exit wound was shown on the back under 
the scapula; however, we have observed that doctor has mentioned the 
track of bullet on dissection of body in following words:- 
“After piercing skin, fascia the bullet entered through 5th and 6th intercostals 
space on the left side 6 cm about left nipple further pierced the left pleura left 
middle lob of left lung pulmonary artery left side of heart, right lower lob of lung 
and finally made its exit on right 8th intercostals space. Whole chest cavity was 
full of blood.” 
What are the 5th and 6th intercostals space on the left side and 8th 
intercostals space on the right side, let’s see the following diagram; 
 
9.     Understanding the above diagram clearly shows that bullet 
entered from left side of rib cage and exited from right side of the rib 
cage without its exit from the back, otherwise doctor must have 
mentioned the further exit of bullet from the back side as she has 
mentioned while showing its entry inlet. Therefore, there was a 
contradiction in medical evidence as bullet entered from the left side 
of chest whereas prosecution claimed it a fire on the front of chest. 
Another touchy aspect in medical evidence is the size of entry wound 
which is bigger than the exit wound and it is not possible in ordinary

                        Crl. Appeal No. 457 of 2019                                                                                      11 
 
circumstances but presence of tattooing can produce such type of 
effect if the fire is made with palleted weapon because the central 
mass of pellets begins to disperse, entry wounds have a large central 
defect, the edges of which appear scalloped, looking somewhat “rat-
nibbled” or resembling the pattern of a cookie cutter, but in bullet 
injury it is possible only in situations as explained in Parikh’s 
Textbook of Medical Jurisprudence, Forensic Medicine and 
Toxicology 
(SEVENTH 
EDITION), 
2003; 
Section 
IV, 
MECHANICAL INJURIES-GENERAL ASPECTS at Page 4.46; 
which are as follows:- 
“(1) In a contact range shot, when the soft tissues at the entry are torn 
by in-rushing gases (2) when bullet is yawing as it enters perhaps 
because of ricochet (3) when an entire bullet enters and breaks up with 
only a small portion exiting (4) Tangential entry wounds with local 
avulsion of tissue and bone (5) Bullets entering through creased or 
folded skin but exiting through a less complicated surface.”   
Deceased apparently from her snap seemed us like bulky, therefore, 
bullet-hit on the left side was any entry in soft tissues; likewise 
‘yawing’ connotes twist or oscillate because of ricochet about a 
vertical axis and it occurs due to striking of bullet on a hard object 
before entering the body (though ricochet also happens within the 
body by striking of bullet on the bony area). In this case if it is read 
that bullet hit on the main gate first and then enters the body, the case 
of prosecution becomes more doubtful because investigating officer 
has shown mark of bullet on the gate from inside as depicted from one 
of the snaps (P/2-4) whereas it was not the prosecution case that 
assailants had entered the garage. Prosecution had also claimed two 
fire shots at the place of occurrence but the investigating officer failed 
to collect any led bullet from the place of occurrence nor its further 
mark on nearby wall after hitting the main gate. The other related sign 
could be the tangential entry wound with local avulsion of tissue and 
bone which could happen in close range fire when assailant is taller 
than the victim or if he fires with pointed pistol up into down. If it be 
considered in this case then assailant must have been in a close range

                        Crl. Appeal No. 457 of 2019                                                                                      12 
 
of 1-2 feet because doctor has observed the tattooing but while 
scanning the evidence we have observed that witnesses deposed the 
inter se distance between appellant and victim as 5 feet, and the same 
distance is mentioned in the site plan; therefore, such type of wound 
description is not possible from 5 feet when doctor has also observed 
the abraded collar at entry wound. So, there is serious conflict in 
medical and ocular account which shows that occurrence was not 
committed in the manner as being claimed by the prosecution. This 
contradiction is fatal to the prosecution. Reliance is placed on case 
reported as “MUHAMMAD IDREES and another Vs. The STATE and 
others” (2021 SCMR 612) and such contradiction also leads us to 
draw an inference that as a matter of fact the prosecution witnesses 
were not truthful in their stance and were not present at the place of 
occurrence at the relevant time and had not witnessed the occurrence. 
Reliance in this regard is placed on the cases “MUHAMMAD 
ASHRAF alias ACCHU versus The STATE” (2019 SCMR 652) and 
“ZAFAR Versus The STATE and others” (2018 SCMR 326).  
10.   CDR of phone number 923004313801 in use of Tahir Imam            
co-accused was brought on record showing that on 02.02.2018 at 5/11 
a.m., a call was received by him from the cell number 3050321281 of 
Sajid appellant and it lasted for 52 minutes and other call he received 
from the same number at 6.00 a.m., for a duration of 13 minutes. Data 
seems manipulated because if the first call lasted for 52 minutes, then 
by adding 52 minutes in 5/11 a.m., it would turn out to be a time as 
06:03 a.m.; therefore, it is real impossibility that in between running 
call, another call was received from the same number. Moreover, 
except these two calls no other call was shown to have made by said 
Sajid ever to Tahir Imam co-accused, and investigating officer also 
did not opt to obtain CDR of Sajid appellant. Even otherwise “Voice 
Record Transcript” or “End to End Audio Recording” was not 
available to show that said Phone numbers were in actual use of both 
the accused or through said phones numbers they were interacting

                        Crl. Appeal No. 289-J of 2019 
                        Crl. Appeal No. 457 of 2019                                                                                      13 
 
with each other; therefore, CDR was not in the form as held by Full 
Bench of this Court in case reported as “Mst. Saima Noreen vs The 
State and another” (PLJ 2023 Cr. C 371 (FB); for reference, relevant 
paragraph is reproduced:-  
10. Although any accused or witness can claim or admit possession and 
use of any SIM “Subscriber Identity Module’ by him or anybody else at 
the time of occurrence or any other relevant time yet mere such claim or 
admission is not sufficient for relying on CDR “Call Data Record” of 
said 
SIM 
because 
CDR 
only 
shows 
use 
of 
SIM 
in 
territorial/geographical jurisdiction of “Cell Phone Tower” installed by 
telecom operator and does not disclose that who is actually/exactly 
carrying and using said SIM; however, “Voice Record Transcript” or 
“End to End Audio Recording” can reflect the detail/identification of the 
user. Therefore, without “Voice Recording Transcript”, mere “Call Data 
Record” (CDR) alone of the SIM is inconclusive piece of evidence 
regarding identity of its user/carrier.” 
 
This managed attempt on the part of investigating agency clearly 
shows that occurrence took place much prior to the time shown by 
the prosecution, which fact also had a support of observation of 
doctor that duration between injury and post mortem was 6-8 hours. 
Stretching it back from 12-noon (time of postmortem) the time of 
occurrence becomes as of 6:00 a.m. or 4:00 a.m., therefore, it is clear 
that no one had seen the occurrence but later in order to hide 
something bad, the present appellant was dragged into this case 
11.    The presence of PW-9 & PW-10 at the crime scene was highly 
doubtful as observed above, therefore, the best evidence in this case 
was the deposition of Nadia Saleem, being inmate of house, directly 
connected with the motive, but she has been withheld, though her 
statement was recorded by investigating officer PW-11, therefore, this 
Court is justified to hold that had she appeared in the dock, her 
statement would not have been favourable to the prosecution. An 
adverse inference is therefore, drawn against the prosecution.  
12. 
For what has been discussed above, in the instant case the 
prosecution has totally failed to establish the charge against the 
accused/appellant beyond any reasonable of doubt and it is trite that to 
extend benefit of doubt to an accused person, it is not necessary that 

                        Murder Reference No. 45 of 2019 
                        Crl. Appeal No. 289-J of 2019 
                        Crl. Appeal No. 457 of 2019                                                                                      14 
 
there should be several circumstances creating doubt, rather one 
reasonable doubt is sufficient to acquit an accused. This principle was 
expounded by august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the cases reported 
as “Najaf Ali Shah case vs. The State” (2021 SCMR 736) in the 
following words:- 
“It is a well settled principle of law that for the accused to be 
afforded this right of the benefit of the doubt it is not necessary that 
there should be many circumstances creating uncertainty and if there 
is only one doubt, the benefit of the same must got to the petitioner”  
Consequently, appeal (Crl. Appeal No. 289-J of 2019) is allowed and 
the accused/appellant is acquitted of the charge. He shall be released 
forthwith if not required in any other case. The case property, if any, 
shall be disposed of in accordance with law and the record of the trial 
court be sent back immediately.  
13. 
As regards Crl. Appeal No.457 of 2019 qua acquittal of Tahir 
Imam, we have found that reasoning advanced by the learned trial court 
to record his acquittal, is well founded and no perversity in the 
judgment of his acquittal has been observed by us; hence, this appeal 
against acquittal is dismissed. 
Murder Reference No. 45 of 2019 is answered in the negative. 
              Sentence of death is not confirmed.
