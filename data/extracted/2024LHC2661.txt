Petitioners by: 
Mr. Abuzar Salman Khan Niazi, Advocate.  
Mr. Zain Sheikh, Advocate.  
Respondents by: 
Mr. Muhammad Saad Bin Ghazi, Assistant 
Advocate General, Punjab alongwith Tariq 
Ismail, Litigation Officer and M. Suleman 
Akash, Law Officer, Social Welfare & Bait-
ul-Maal Department.  
 
 
Anwaar Hussain J: Through this single judgment, present as 
well as connected constitutional petition, bearing W.P No. 
86015/2023 are being decided, simultaneously, as common question 
of law is required to be adjudicated, which is articulated as under: 
“Whether an employee of a project that has 
been converted from the development side to 
non-development 
side, 
is 
entitled 
to 
be 
regularized, as a matter of right?  
2. 
The present petitioners are employees of the project, namely, 
Establishment of Musafir Khana (Panah Gah) at different locations of 
Lahore whereas the petitioners of connected petition, bearing W.P 
No.86015/2023, are employees of Old Age Home and Panah Gah-
Afiat, at different locations of the Province of Punjab. Both the 
projects are hereinafter referred to as “the Projects”.  
3. 
By way of factual background, it has been noted that the 
petitioners were appointed in the Punjab Social Welfare and Bait-ul-

W.P No.41334/2023 
Maal Department, on contract basis, in BPS-01 and BPS-11, and their 
contracts were extended from time to time and admittedly, are still in 
service. The Projects were started on the development side, however, 
the same have been converted from Development (Current) Budget to 
Non-Development (Regular) Budget, inter alia, vide Notifications 
dated 02.09.2021 and 30.05.2023, therefore, prayer has been made in 
both these petitions that services of the petitioners be regularized, 
from the date of their initial appointments.   
4. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners aver that since the Projects 
have been converted from the development to the non-development 
side, therefore, the petitioners are entitled to regularization. Place 
reliance on judgment dated 05.05.2014 passed by the Supreme Court 
of Pakistan in Civil Appeal Nos. 275 and 276 of 2014 titled 
“Government of the Punjab through Secretary Environment 
Protection Department, Lahore, & another v. Maqsood Ahmed & 
others”.  
5. 
Conversely, learned Law Officer submits that no doubt the 
Projects have been converted from the development to the non-
development side, on 02.09.2021, however, it does not mean that the 
petitioners are to be regularized as a matter of right. Contends that for 
every new project/scheme, staff is hired on temporary basis and such 
appointees are governed by the terms and conditions of their offers of 
appointment whereas the terms and conditions of the civil posts are 
governed by the Punjab Civil Servants Act, 1974, the Punjab Civil 
Servants (Appointment & Conditions of Service) Rules, 1974 and 
service rules of the department concerned read with the policy in 
vogue, therefore, the petitioners, after conversion of the projects from 
the development to the non-development, can neither be regularized 
nor can be allowed to continue unless in accordance with uniform 
policy of the government formulated in this respect, which in present 
case mandates qualification of the petitioners through competitive

W.P No.41334/2023 
process. Adds that the department has already advertised the posts of 
the Projects for recruitment thereagainst and rights of the petitioners 
have been duly safeguarded in terms of letter dated 06.06.2022 issued 
by the Services and General Administration Department, Lahore, as 
the petitioners will be given extra marks for their service rendered 
during the life of the Projects, as also age relaxation qua the said 
period of service, at the time of recruitment and due to the interim 
relief granted in favor of the petitioners, said recruitment process 
could not be completed. Places reliance on the law laid down by the 
Supreme Court in case titled “Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 
through Chief Secretary and others v. Muhammad Younas” (2021 
SCMR 1045), to contend that employees of a project are not entitled 
to regularization, as a matter of right.   
6. 
In rebuttal, learned counsel for the petitioners submit that the 
judgment cited as Muhammad Younas supra is per incuriam as the 
earlier judgment passed by the Supreme Court in case Maqsood 
Ahmed supra was not considered and in case of such conflict between 
the earlier and the subsequent judgments, as per law of precedents, the 
former judgment is to be followed. Place reliance on case titled “Mst. 
Samrana Nawaz and others v. M.C.B. Bank Ltd. and others” (PLD 
2021 SC 581) in support of their contentions. 
7. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
8. 
Before addressing the nub of the matter, which is to determine 
whether the petitioners are entitled to regularization, as a matter of 
right, it will be appropriate to address the legal question as to which of 
the two judgments of the Supreme Court is to be followed in the 
instant case. In case of Maqsood Ahmed supra, the Supreme Court 
held as under:  
“5. 
After considering arguments advanced by the 
learned counsel for the parties and having perused the 

 
 
4 
W.P No.41334/2023 
record, we have come to the conclusion that the 
employees of the project (which project has now become 
a permanent non-development department of the 
Government) cannot just be thrown out of their 
employment for the simple reason that the position on 
which they were working which are said to be the 
laboratories are still existing and have become permanent 
laboratories of the Government and the employees who 
were employed in the project are still required to work in 
the said laboratories. In this situation the appropriate 
manner in which the grievance of respondents can well 
be redressed is that the Government should consider the 
cases of the respondents for their regularization in 
service on merits.”  
(Emphasis supplied) 
Whereas in case of Muhammad Younas supra, the Supreme Court 
held as under:  
“18. ……We, therefore, find that the conclusion of the 
learned High Court that the benefits of the Regularization 
Act, 2009 to the extent of regularization of service were 
available to the Respondents is clearly based on incorrect 
appreciation and interpretation of the law and is 
unsustainable.” 
Similarly, in case of Mst. Samrana Nawaz supra, the Supreme Court 
has held that in case of conflict between the two opinions of the Court, 
the former judgment is to be followed, which is trite law. However, it 
is to be noted that there is no disconnect between the above referred 
two judgments of the Supreme Court inasmuch as in case of Maqsood 
Ahmed supra, the Supreme Court held that the project employees are 
entitled to be considered for regularization as similarly placed persons 
had already been granted such relief whereas in case of Muhammad 
Younas supra, the relief was not extended for the reason that there 
was a Project Policy in vogue, in the KPK province, which 
contemplated that the project employees can be re-appointed on need 
basis, if the project is extended over any phase or phases and that if 
the project is regularized, the posts are to be filled through Public 
Service Commission and/or Departmental Selection Committee. 

 
 
5 
W.P No.41334/2023 
Therefore, it is not a situation where there is any conflict between the 
two judgments of the Supreme Court and hence, question of following 
the earlier judgment in the light of dicta laid down in case of Mst. 
Samrana Nawaz supra does not arise. 
9. 
There is yet another aspect of the matter from which the present 
matter can be examined as there is a major distinction in the 
circumstances when the judgment in case of Maqsood Ahmad supra, 
dated 05.05.2014 in C.A. Nos. 275 & 276 of 2014 was passed and 
when the present case is being decided inasmuch as there was no 
policy in field regarding regularization of project employees  in the 
year 2014, to safe guard their rights, whereas, at present, the 
regularization of the project employees is backed up by a uniform 
policy of the Government of Punjab, which envisages certain 
safeguards and advantages for such employees, in terms of letter dated 
06.06.2022, that contemplates as under:  
“…viii. 
While making recruitment, the project 
 
employees may be allowed relaxation in 
 
upper age for the period they have served 
 
in the project. 
 
ix. 
For experience, in the relevant field 
 
including the experience or project, two 
 
marks per year upto the maximum of 10 
 
marks shall be granted to project 
 
employees for recruitment in BS-1 to 
 
BS-15.” 
It is well evident that the above quoted safeguards are in place for the 
benefit of the project employees including the petitioners. It is 
essentially a policy matter falling within the domain of the executive. 
This Court in exercise of judicial review cannot navigate beyond and 
above the policy set out by the executive limb of the State, for project 
employees, as this would surely amount to the judicial overreach. 
Therefore, a direction cannot be passed to the respondents for 

 
 
6 
W.P No.41334/2023 
regularization of service of the petitioners, as of right, without 
advertising the posts for general public.  
10. 
Admittedly, the petitioners are in service albeit on contract, and 
the Projects have been converted in to non-development side and the 
posts have been  advertised for the recruitment, therefore, the 
petitioners may apply for the same, if they have not already done and 
the respondents are directed to make the recruitment against the 
Projects’ posts on regular basis, strictly adhering to and complying 
with the safeguard extended for the projects employees, in terms of 
letter dated 06.06.2022.  
11. 
Before parting with, it is also imperative to spell out that the 
respondents have intended to continue the Projects and converted the 
same from the development to non-development side. Any 
organization aims at continuity in its working and functions which 
may run into difficulty if the serving employees are ousted from the 
service and asked to compete in the process. Therefore, it is prudent 
that the petitioners, who are admittedly in service, are allowed to 
continue to work till the completion of the process of recruitment, on 
regular basis, through competitive process and further continuation of 
the petitioners would be determined only if they qualify and stand on 
the merit list. 
12. 
Disposed of in above terms.
