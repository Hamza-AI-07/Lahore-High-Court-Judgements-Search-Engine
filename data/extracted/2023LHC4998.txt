JAWAD HASSAN, J. The 
Petitioner 
has 
invoked 
the 
constitutional jurisdiction of this Court under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”) 
and sought direction to the Respondents to implement the order dated 
17.12.2021 of Supreme Court of Pakistan passed in C.P.No.491/2012 
by reinstating him into service from the date of his termination i.e. 
21.12.1998. Through this judgment, this Court will discuss in detail the 
“Functional Test” regarding the maintainability of writ petition in 
service matters against the National Engineering Services Pakistan 
Limited (“NESPAK”).  
A. 
BRIEF BACKGROUND 
2. 
Facts of the case, as per petition, are that the Petitioner was 
appointed as Driver in the Respondents department vide service 
contract dated 26.09.1992 initially for a period of one year however, his 

Writ Petition No.3320 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   2 
services were regularized vide appointment letter dated 23.08.1995 
enabling the Respondents to terminate it in terms of clause 2. The 
Respondents, on completion of project, terminated the Petitioner’s 
service vide letter dated 21.12.1998. It is Petitioner’s version that in 
terms of order dated 17.12.2021, he fulfills the criteria for reinstatement 
but the Respondents are adamant to reinstate him despite the fact that 
they have given the same benefit to similarly placed persons namely 
Ejaz Ali and Muhammad Azam.  
B. 
PETITIONER’S ARGUMENTS. 
3.  
Learned counsel for the Petitioner Mr. Moazzam Sajjad Kiani 
inter-alia contended that the Petitioner is entitled for the relief granted 
to other similar employees in terms of order dated 17.12.2021 passed 
by the Supreme Court of Pakistan whereby the services of terminated 
employees, between 01.11.1996 to 12.10.1999, were ordered to be 
reinstated; that the Respondents have not implemented the aforesaid 
order despite filing representation by him. 
C. 
RESPONDENTS ARGUMENTS. 
4. 
On the other hand, counsel for the Respondents Mr. Saad 
Rasool, ASC filed report and parawise comments and objected to 
maintainability of the petition on the ground that “NESPAK” is a 
private limited company and its service Regulations are non-statutory 
in nature and as such the relationship between the employer and the 
employee would be considered as ‘master and servant’. He stated that 
services of the Petitioner were required only for a period of one year as 
per contract dated 26.09.1992; though his services were regularized 
vide letter dated 23.08.1995 but clause-2 of the appointment letter 
empowered the “NESPAK” to terminate his services. He next stated 
that the Petitioner filed an appeal against his termination before Single 
Bench of National Industrial Relation Commission, NIRC which was 
dismissed on 04.05.1999 and afterwards the Petitioner moved 
application for release of his fund/gratuity and same was duly released 
on 26.03.2001. Mr. Saad Rasool, ASC pointed out that the Petitioner 
himself attached a certificate dated 16.06.2008 (Page 39 of the petition) 
according to which the “NESPAK” is an autonomous organization, 

Writ Petition No.3320 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   3 
fully owned by Government of Pakistan, working under the 
administrative control of the Ministry of Water and Power and its 
hundred percent shares are held by the Federal Government (Ministry 
of Water and Power). It is managed by a Board of Directors whose 
Chairman is the Secretary, Ministry of Water and Power, Government 
of Pakistan, and all other Directors are appointed/nominated by the 
Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Water and Power. He strenuously 
argued that the Petitioner does not fall within the definition of sacked 
employees under the Sacked Employees (Re-instatement) Act, 2010 
therefore, he is not entitled for the relief claimed for.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
D. 
MAINTAINABILITY OF WRIT PETITION 
6. 
At the very outset, learned counsel for the Petitioner was 
confronted with the issue of maintainability of writ petition and he was 
asked to first cross this hurdle. In response thereto, learned counsel for 
the Petitioner stated that “NESPAK” is working under the 
administrative control of Ministry of Water & Power, Government of 
Pakistan which is a statutory body therefore, writ is maintainable as per 
Article 199(5) of the “Constitution”.  
7. 
On the other hand, Mr. Saad Rasool, ASC stated that 
“NESPAK” is an autonomous organization, fully owned by 
Government of Pakistan and working under the administrative control 
of the Ministry of Water and Power and its hundred percent shares are 
held by the Federal Government (Ministry of Water and Power). 
Moreover, it is stated that the NESPAK is managed by a Board of 
Directors whose Chairman is the Secretary, Ministry of Water and 
Power, Government of Pakistan, and all other Directors are 
appointed/nominated by the Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Water 
and Power therefore, being non-statutory, writ is not maintainable.  
8. 
There is no cavil to the proposition that “NESPAK” is a private 
limited company incorporated under the provisions of the Companies 
Act, 1913 (now Companies Act, 2017) and terms and conditions of its 
employment are governed by National Engineering Services Pakistan 
(Pvt.) Limited Employees Service Rules (the “NESPAK Service 

Writ Petition No.3320 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   4 
Rules”) , which were framed by the Board of Directors of “NESPAK” 
in pursuance of powers conferred by the Memorandum and Articles of 
Association, in the meeting held on 02.08.1974. Before examining the 
Rules being statutory or non-statutory, the Court has to see the status of 
“NESPAK” and apply ‘Functional Test’, discussed below. 
i. 
Status of NESPAK 
9. 
The object and purpose of “NESPAK” as argued by Mr. Saad 
Rasool, ASC above, has been discussed in “MUHAMMAD TAHIR 
NAWAZ CHEEMA and others versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN 
and others” (2023 PLC (C.S.) 662) wherein the Court has held that 
“Admittedly, NESPAK was established by the Government of Pakistan 
in 1973 as a private limited company under the Companies Act, 1913. 
The objective was to create a pool of talented engineers and attain self-
reliance in engineering consultancy and replace foreign consultants.1 
At present it has a paid-up capital of Rs.5,000,000/- divided into 
500,000 ordinary shares of Rs.10/- each. Out of these the Ministry of 
Energy (Power Division), Government of Pakistan, holds 499,993 
shares while one share each is held by the Secretary, Ministry of 
Energy (Power Division), the Additional Chief Secretary, Ministry of 
Finance, the representatives of the Governments of Balochistan, KPK, 
Punjab and Sindh and the Managing Director/President, NESPAK. The 
company’s Board of Directors is also appointed by the Prime Minister. 
Importantly, it performs various functions which are essentially those 
of the State and, through the exercise of public power, creates public 
employments”. 
 
ii. 
Functional Tests to determine Rules of NESPAK Statutory or 
non-statutory. 
 
10. 
The nub of the matter is whether service rules of public sector 
companies or corporations are statutory or non-statutory. Undoubtedly, 
the statutory corporations and public sector companies are made under 
the companies law which is in this case the Companies Act, 1913 (now 
Companies Act, 2017). The Supreme Court of Pakistan has declared in 
various pronouncements such companies like Pakistan Steel Mills 
Corporations (PTCL), Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL), 

Writ Petition No.3320 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   5 
Oil and Gas Development Corporation Limited (OGDCL), Pakistan 
Television Corporation Limited (PTVCL), Pakistan International 
Airlines Corporation Limited (PIACL) and other public sector 
companies in Pakistan out of which only OGDCL has been declared as 
statutory, whereas SNGPL, PTVCL, PIACL have been declared as  
non-statutory. The issue whether these are rules made in the Statute or 
by the Act or by the Board, has been discussed in various judgments 
which will be discussed in later part of this judgment. However, there 
are various contradictory views of this Court in declaring Rules of 
certain 
bodies, 
authorities, 
boards, 
educational 
institutions, 
organizations as statutory or non-statutory in terms of their Service 
Rules or Regulations but the Functional Test, to determine whether 
rules are statutory or non-statutory, has been developed by this Court in 
the case of “MUNDA ELEVEN CRICKET CLUB versus FEDERATION 
OF PAKISTAN and 4 others” (PLD 2017 Lahore 802) by ruling out 
the maintainability of writ petition in service matters. The relevant 
portion reads as under: 
“24. Importantly, under Section 3 of the 
Ordinance, the Government has powers to make 
boards for the control of sports in Pakistan for the 
purpose of promoting and developing uniform 
standards of competition in sports in Pakistan 
comparable 
to 
the 
standards 
prevailing 
internationally and regulating and controlling 
sports in Pakistan on a national basis. The 
„sports‟ has been defined in Section 2(i) of the 
Ordinance, and recognizes cricket as a sport. 
Therefore, the issuance of the PCB Constitution, 
under which PCB has been established, has the 
backing of law”. 
25. The case law submitted by the learned counsel 
of the Respondent, Muhammad Zaman supra, also 
ruled that the test of whether rules/regulations 
were statutory or otherwise was not solely 
whether their framing required the approval of 
the Government or not, rather it was the nature 
and efficacy of such rules/regulations. The Court 
had to see whether the rules/regulations dealt with 
instructions for internal control or management, in 
which case they would be non-statutory, or they 
were broader than and were complementary to the 
parent statute in matters of crucial importance, in 
which event they would be statutory.

Underlining for emphases 
 
11. 
The Functional Test in determining the maintainability of writ 
petition under Article 199(5) of the “Constitution” was also discussed 
by this Court in “AOWN ABBAS BHATTI versus FORMAN 
CHRISTIAN COLLEGE and 2 others” (PLD 2018 Lahore 435) 
elaborating the ‘functional test’, ‘the application of test’ and 
‘administrative control test’ and this view was followed by larger 
Bench of this Court in “DR. KHALID ZAMIR RASIB versus 
PROVINCE OF THE PUNJAB through Secretary Higher Education 
Department, Lahore and 4 others” (2021 PLC (C.S.) 994) by holding 
that “after analyzing the reasons by two learned Benches of this Court 
we endorse the viewpoint taken in the case of Aown Abbas Bhatti 
(supra) as it clinches the issue in its true perspective”. Furthermore, the 
Rules of the “NESPAK” are non-statutory as held by this Court in the 
case of “UMER ATTA-UR-REHMAN KHAN versus MINISTRY OF 
ENERGY through Secretary/Chairman, NESPAK and 4 others” (2021 
PLC (C.S.) 1126) wherein it has been observed that “admittedly, 
NESPAK is a private limited Company and its Rules namely Employees 
(Efficiency & Discipline) Rules, 1974 (Rules) are framed by the Board 
of Directors of the company under the power conferred on them 
through Articles of Association of NESPAK. Neither these rules are 
framed by the Federal Government or approval of the Federal 
Government nor these rules are made under any statute, therefore, said 
rules cannot be termed as statutory rules”. 
12. 
It is observed in view of the above said judgments and the status 
of “NESPAK” by applying the “Functional Test” that the “NESPAK 
Service Rules” are neither issued under any Statute nor with approval 
of the Federal Government or to be published in official Gazette hence 
the same cannot be treated as statutory rules. It is settled law that where 
the Rules or Regulations are not required to be made with the approval 
of the Federal Government, they cannot be termed as statutory in 
nature. The perusal of “NESPAK Service Rules” shows that same are 

Writ Petition No.3320 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   7 
not framed under any Statute but were made by the Board of Directors 
of the company/NESPAK in exercise of the powers conferred on it by 
the Article of Association of the Company. Therefore, these Rules are 
merely regulations, instructions and directions for internal use and 
management of the Company, hence principle of 'Master and Servant' 
will 
be 
squarely 
applicable 
to 
the 
employees 
of 
the 
company/NESPAK”.  
13. 
In view of above, the principles elaborating the ‘Functional Test’ 
by this Court in ““AOWN ABBAS BHATTI case and “MUNDA 
ELEVEN CRICKET CLUB case and law laid down in aforementioned 
judgments, it is quite clear that writ is not maintainable against the 
Respondents-NESPAK. 
iii. 
Jurisprudence of Supreme Court of Pakistan on Statutory and 
Non-Statutory. 
 
14. 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan in “EXECUTIVE COUNCIL, 
ALLAMA 
IQBAL 
OPEN 
UNIVERSITY, 
ISLAMABAD 
through 
Chairman and another Versus M. TUFAIL HASHMI” (2010 SCMR 
1484) has observed that though employees, who are discharging 
functions in connection with the affairs of Federation, can approach 
the High Court under Article 199 of the Constitution but subject to 
the condition if their services are protected under the statutory rules. In 
“MUHAMMAD ZAMAN and others versus GOVERNMENT OF 
PAKISTAN and others” (2017 SCMR 571) the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan has held that since the regulations in question, passed under 
the amended law, concerned the pension and gratuity matters of 
employees of SBP are basically instructions for the internal control or 
management of SBP and are therefore non-statutory. In “PAKISTAN 
TELECOMMUNICATION CO. LTD. through Chairman Versus 
IQBAL NASIR and others” (PLD 2011 SC 132), it has been held 
that “Employees of Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation Limited 
were governed by principle of "Master and servant" and in absence of 
statutory rules, constitutional petitions filed by employees were not 
maintainable”.  In Pakistan Defence Officer’s case (2013 SCMR 1707) 
the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has held as under: 

Writ Petition No.3320 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   8 
“Where conditions of service of employees of a 
statutory 
body 
are 
not 
regulated 
by 
Rules/Regulations framed under the Statute but 
only Rules or Instructions issued for its internal 
use, any violation thereof cannot normally be 
enforced through writ jurisdiction and they 
would be governed by the principle of 'Master 
and Servant'.” 
 
15.  
Similarly, the issue of maintainability of writ under Article 199 
of the Constitution has been discussed in detail by the Supreme Court 
in “PAKISTAN INTERNATIONAL AIRLINE CORPORATION and 
others Versus TANWEER-UR-REHMAN and others” (PLD 2010 
Supreme Court 676) and has held as follows  
“25. Thus, in view of discussion made 
hereinabove, we are persuaded to hold that 
although the appellant-Corporation is 
performing functions in connection with the 
affairs of the Federation but since the 
services of the respondent-employees are 
governed by the contract executed between 
both the parties, as is evident from the facts 
narrated hereinabove, and not by the 
statutory rules framed under section 30 of 
the Act, 1956 with the prior approval of the 
Federal Government, therefore, they will be 
governed by the principle of Master and 
Servant.” 
 
16. 
In “ABDUL WAHAB and others Versus HBL and others”  
(2013 SCMR 1383), the Supreme Court has held that where a service 
grievance was agitated by a person/employee who was not governed 
by statutory rules of service, constitutional petition is not be 
maintainable. The Division Bench of this Court in “PAKISTAN 
INTERNATIONAL AIRLINE and others Versus NOREEN NAZ BUTT” 
(2017 PLC (C.S.) 923) has held that “the Appellant Pakistan 
International Airline has no statutory rules and the relationship 
between the Respondent and the Appellants is that of master and 
servant. It is an established principle that in such like cases the 
Constitutional petition is not maintainable”.  

Writ Petition No.3320 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   9 
17.  
Similar view was upheld by Supreme Court in its judgment 
reported as “PAKISTAN AIRLINE PILOTS ASSOCIATION and 
others Versus PAKISTAN INTERNATIONAL AIRLINE and another” 
(2019 SCMR 278) with the following observation: 
“As the terms and conditions of employment 
in PIAC are admittedly not governed by any 
statutory provision and the employees are 
amenable to the Rule of "Master and 
Servant", Article 199 of the Constitution of 
Pakistan 1973 cannot be invoked. Reliance is 
placed on PIA Corporation v. Syed Suleman 
Alam Rizvi (1996 SCMR 1185), Pakistan 
International Airline Corporation and others 
v. Tanweer-ur-Rehman and others (PLD 2010 
SC 676) and Abdul Wahab and others v. HBL 
and others (2013 SCMR 1383).” 
 
18. 
Even otherwise, the Petitioner does not fall within the ambit of 
‘sacked employees’ in terms of Section 2(f) of the Sacked Employees 
(Re-instatement) Act, 2010 which clearly defines that a person who 
was appointed as a regular or ad hoc employee or on contract basis or 
otherwise in service of employer, during the period from 1st day of 
November, 1993 to the 30th day of November, 1996 (both days 
inclusive) and was dismissed, removed, terminated from service or 
whose contract period was expired or who has given forced golden 
hand shake during the period from 1st day of November, 1996 to 12th 
day of October, 1999 (both days inclusive). In the case in hand, the 
Petitioner’s date of appointment is 26.09.1992 whereas the above said 
Section prescribes the period to be come under the above said 
definition from 01.11.1993 to 30.11.1996. Furthermore, the principle 
of ‘Master and Servant” is applicable to the case in hand as the rules 
of “NESPAK” were not framed under any Statute rather these were 
made by the Board of Directors of the “NESPAK” in exercise of 
powers conferred on it by Articles of Association of the Company and 
such rules are merely regulations, instructions and directions for 
internal use and management of the company. It is also observed that 

Writ Petition No.3320 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   10 
the order dated 28.07.2022 is indicative of the fact that the Petitioner 
was provided fair opportunity of hearing but he remained fail to prove 
his case through cogent and confidence expiring evidence and that 
too, it was not challenged by him before any forum.   
E. 
CONCLUSION  
19. 
In view of law laid down by the Supreme Court of Pakistan, the 
learned counsel for the Petitioner has failed to cross the 
hurdle/objection taken by the learned counsel for the Respondents qua 
maintainability of this petition. Consequently, this petition is dismissed 
being not maintainable. However, the Petitioner is at liberty to 
challenge the impugned order before the competent forum, if so 
advised.
