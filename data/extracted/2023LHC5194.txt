JAWAD HASSAN, J. By way of this constitutional petition 
filed under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”) the Petitioner has called in 
question the vires of order dated 24.12.2020, whereby the Additional 
District Judge, Rawalpindi while dismissing the revision petition filed 
by the Petitioner upheld the orders dated 11.12.2020 and 18.12.2020 
passed by the Executing Court/Senior Civil Judge (Family Division), 
Rawalpindi. The Court will also elucidate the mode and procedure 
provided under Section 13 of the Family Court Act, 1964 (the “Act”). 
I. 
CONTEXT 
2. 
Precisely the facts necessary for adjudication of instant petition 
are that a judgment and decree dated 30.06.2019 was passed in favour 
of the Respondents No.3 to 5, execution petition whereof was filed 
before Executing Court, Gujranwala which was subsequently 
transferred to District Courts Rawalpindi for its satisfaction. Due to 
non-payment of decretal amount by the Petitioner/judgment debtor, 
the Executing Court, from time to time, passed various orders for 
attachment of his moveable and immoveable property. Finally, orders 
dated 11.12.2020 and 18.12.2020 were passed and were challenged 

  
W.P.Nos.61 of 2021  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       2 
through Civil Revision but the same was dismissed vide impugned 
order dated 24.12.2020 by the Additional District Judge, hence this 
petition.  
II. 
ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the Petitioner inter alia contends that 
impugned orders are result of mis-reading and non-reading of material 
available on record; that the Executing Court in terms of order dated 
11.12.2020 and 18.12.2020 issued warrants for attachment of vehicles 
without lawful justification; that the Executing Court has adopted the 
mode for attachment of his moveable/immoveable property which, 
under the law is not warranted; that the revisional Court has not 
properly dealt with the issues, as such the impugned orders are not 
sustainable in law.  
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for Respondents contended that 
impugned orders have been passed after taking into consideration 
all aspects of the matter in dispute hence do not suffer from any 
error or material irregularity.  
5. 
I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the parties 
and perused the record.  
III. 
DETERMINATION 
6. 
Admittedly, judgment and decree passed in favour of the 
Respondents No.3 to 5 by the Family Court, Gujranwala was 
transferred to the Court of Senior Civil Judge, Civil Division, 
Rawalpindi vide order dated 22.01.2020 for its execution as the 
Petitioner/judgment debtor was the resident of District Rawalpindi. 
Memo of attendance filed on behalf of petitioner by his counsel on 
24.02.2020 was turned down and he appeared on next date i.e. 
02.03.2020, when he failed to pay decretal amount, as such; he was 
served with show cause notice as to why decretal amount should not 
be recovered from him and, failing which, as to why he should not be 
sent to Civil Prison for one year. However, he was directed to be 
released subject to payment of 50 % of decretal amount in three 
installments as well as furnishing surety to the extent of remaining 

  
W.P.Nos.61 of 2021  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       3 
50% of decretal amount. Operation of said order dated 02.03.2020 
was suspended in Civil Revision, as such, the Petitioner was directed 
to be released. On 20.06.2020, it was agitated on behalf of the 
Respondents No.3 to 5 that already attached property of the Petitioner 
including a Honda City car may be auctioned for purpose of 
satisfaction of decree in execution as only warrants of arrest of the 
Petitioner have been suspended by this Court vide order dated 
18.06.2019 passed in Writ Petition No.1264 of 2020. Thereafter, 
warrants of attachment of another Suzuki Alto car and motorcycle 
were issued vide order dated 10.08.2020. Robkar was issued to 
Assistant Commissioner Sadar, Rawalpindi to appoint concerned 
Revenue Officer for determination of market value of said property as 
well as warrant of attachment of aforementioned Honda City car, 
besides unblocking of CNIC of the Petitioner was issued vide order 
dated 03.11.2020. Above mentioned Honda City car having not been 
found for attachment, on 07.12.2020, the Petitioner was directed to 
produce said vehicle, failing which, on 11.12.2020 Robkar was 
directed to be issued to Incharge Anti Car Lifting Cell, Rawalpindi for 
locating whereabouts of said car and to take over possession thereof. 
On 18.12.2020, not only SHO Police Station Sadiqabad was directed 
for production of said Honda City car bearing registration No. AHE-
664, but warrants of attachment of Suzuki Alto car bearing the 
registration No.RLB-212 were also issued. 
7. 
The mode and procedure adopted by the Executing Court for 
satisfaction of subject decree has been agitated against quite hard on 
behalf of the Petitioner. Subject decree has been passed by the Family 
Court and Section 13 of the “Act” which deals with enforcement of 
decrees, reads as follows: 
SECTION 13:–  
(1) 
The Family Court shall pass a decree 
in such form and in such manner as may be 
prescribed, and shall enter its particulars in 
the prescribed register. 
(2) 
If any money is paid or any property is 
delivered in the presence of the Family Court, in 

  
W.P.Nos.61 of 2021  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       4 
satisfaction of the decree, it shall enter the fact of 
payment or the delivery of property, as the case 
may be, in the aforesaid register. 
(3) 
Where a decree relates to the payment 
of money and the decretal amount is not paid 
within time specified by the Court not 
exceeding thirty days, the same shall, if the 
Court so directs be recovered as arrears of 
land revenue, and on recovery shall be paid to 
the decree-holder. 
(4) 
The decree shall be executed by the 
Court, passing it or by such other Civil Court as 
the District Judge may, by special or general 
order, direct. 
(5) 
A Family Court may, if it so deems fit, 
direct that any money to be paid under a decree 
passed by it be paid in such installments as it 
deems fit. 
 
  
Dilating upon said provision of law, the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan has held in case “AMJAD IQBAL versus Mst. NIDA SOHAIL 
and others” (2015 SCMR 128) that “Section 13(3) of the Act itself 
provides that "Where a decree relates to the payment of money and 
the decretal amount is not paid within the time specified by the Court 
[not exceeding thirty days] the same shall, if the Court so directs to 
recover as arrears of land revenue, and on recovery shall be paid to 
the decree-holder." This provision in the Act empowers the Family 
Court to execute its own decree for payment of money by adopting 
modes provided for recovery of arrears of land revenue. In the West 
Pakistan Land Revenue Act various modes of recovery of arrears of 
land revenue are spelt out and one of the modes provided for recovery 
of arrear of land revenue is by selling the immovable property of the 
defaulter.” Though substantially dealing with issue of transfer of 
decrees passed by the Family Courts, it is held in case “Mst. AMMAN 
GUL versus Judge Family Court, Rawalpindi and 2 others”  
(2023 CLC 1300) that “Sub-section (4) of Section 13 of "Act, 
1964" places the Family Court and the Civil Court at the same 
pedestal for the purpose of execution of decree, so in that capacity a 
court "Family" or "Civil" enjoys all powers of the executing court 

  
W.P.Nos.61 of 2021  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       5 
vested in Part II as well as Order XXI of the "C.P.C.".” Further, it is 
observed in case “MUHAMMAD AMIN versus Judge, Family Court, 
Sahiwal and 3 others” (2015 YLR 316) that “The very wording in 
which subsection (3) of section 13 of West Pakistan Family Courts 
Act, 1964 is couched makes it obvious that the money decree is to be 
recovered as arrears of land revenue only if the Court so directs at 
the time of passing the decree. And if no such direction has been made 
by the Court concerned, it may follow any procedure thereafter to 
implement its money decree, including the arrest of the judgment-
debtor and attachment of his property.” 
IV. 
CONDUCT OF THE PETITIONER. 
8. 
It is noted that the Petitioner/judgment debtor filed 
C.M.No.1556 of 2023 for setting aside of order dated 29.05.2023 of 
Executing Court with the prayer that he was ready to pay remaining 
decretal amount in installments for which his application under 
Section 13(5) of the “Act” was pending. This Court vide order 
dated 07.09.2023 directed the Executing Court to decide aforesaid 
application not later than one week and also observed that no 
adverse action against the Petitioner/judgment or his surety be taken 
till decision of aforestated application. Record is indicative of the 
fact that the Executing Court complied with directions of this Court 
and decided application under Section 13(5) of the “Act” vide order 
dated 18.09.2023 and granted time to the Petitioner/judgment 
debtor to deposit Rs.24,25,888/- within three days in respect of 
maintenance allowance of minors, one month time for depositing 
the amount of 15-tolas gold ornaments, whereas remaining amount 
of Rs.500,000/- in next month of payment of valuation of gold 
ornaments. Thereafter, the Petitioner/judgment debtor instead of 
complying with order of Executing Court, filed another 
C.M.No.1756 of 2023 for setting aside of orders dated 08.09.2023 
and 18.09.2023 with the submission that he is ready to deposit 
Rs.5,00,000/- under protest with prayer that interim relief be 
granted in his favour. This Court vide order dated 26.09.2023 

  
W.P.Nos.61 of 2021  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       6 
suspended the impugned orders subject to deposit of Rs.5,00,000/- 
with Deputy Registrar (Judicial) of this Court within two days but 
he did not deposit the said amount. Even record of proceedings 
before the Executing Court reflects that acts and conduct of the 
Petitioner/judgment debtor consistently aimed at frustrating 
proceedings of execution of subject decree. The conduct of the 
Petitioner is very much relevant with controversy in hand. The subject 
decree involving maintenance allowance of Petitioner’s own kids 
pertains to the year 2012 but till date he has not bothered to satisfy the 
same on his own, rather he has been consistent to gear in all efforts to 
frustrate execution proceedings to avoid satisfaction thereof. He time 
and again has chosen way to set in field tactics to handicap 
proceedings conducted for auction of his immoveable property and 
has not even hesitated to put up every effort for bringing even custody 
of his attached vehicles in absolute disguise. Thereafter, the Executing 
Court initiated process for attachment and auction of his 
aforementioned immoveable property and vehicles. Circumstances 
existing in case in hand lead to an irresistible conclusion that the 
Petitioner is capable to satisfy the subject decree, but he deliberately 
and intentionally is avoiding to do so, forcing even his own kids to 
starve. A person showing such a callous attitude, in particular, 
towards discharge of his parental obligation is not entitled for any 
discretionary relief and so is the case with a person himself not ready 
to follow and comply law. Reliance in this regard is placed on 
“MUHAMMAD 
ARIF 
versus 
UZMA 
AFZAL 
and 
others”  
(2011 SCMR 374) wherein it has held as follows: 
“5. There is no cavil to the proposition that the "conduct 
of petitioner can be taken into consideration in allowing 
or 
disallowing 
equitable 
relief 
in 
constitutional 
jurisdiction. The principle that the Court should lean in 
favour of adjudication of causes on merits, appears to be 
available for invocation only when the person relying on 
it himself comes to the Court with clean hands and 
equitable considerations also lie in his favour. High 
Court in exercise of writ jurisdiction is bound to proceed 
on maxim "he who seeks equity must do equity". 

  
W.P.Nos.61 of 2021  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       7 
Constitutional jurisdiction is an equitable jurisdiction. 
Whoever comes to High Court to seek relief has to satisfy 
the conscience of the Court that he has clean hands. Writ 
jurisdiction cannot be exercised in aid of injustice. The 
High Court will not grant relief under this Article when 
the petitioner does not come to the Court with clean 
hands. He may claim relief only when he himself is not 
violating provisions of law, especially of the law under 
which he is claiming entitlement".” 
 
9. 
Above mentioned conduct of the Petitioner cannot be 
ignored lightly as he is involved in blunt defiance of decree passed 
under the “Act”, preamble whereof leads to roads destined for 
purpose reading that “Whereas it is expedient to make provision for 
the establishment of Family Courts for the expeditious settlement and 
disposal of disputes relating to marriage and family affairs and for 
matters connected therewith.” In the judgment reported as “Mst. 
Yasmin Bibi versus Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan and others”  
(PLD 2016 SC 613), the Supreme Court of Pakistan has elaborated 
the preamble of the “Act” and also discussed various sections thereof. 
Relevant portions of Paragraph 10 and 12 of the said judgment are 
reproduced hereunder for ease of the matter:- 
 
“10.  It was in the above background that the 
Legislature 
felt 
essential 
to 
provide 
for 
establishment of Family Courts to deal with all 
matrimonial disputes, mentioned above, in an 
expeditious manner, curtailing the life of 
litigation in such cases. To curb and suppress 
the mischief of delaying tactics on the part of 
unscrupulous husbands, several amendments 
were introduced to the Family Court Act, 1964. 
Some amendments bearing striking features may 
be cited below:- 
S.12-A. Case to be disposed of within a 
specified period. A Family Court shall 
dispose of a case, including a suit for 
dissolution of marriage, within a period 
of six months from the date of institution: 
Provided that where a case is not 
disposed of within six months either party 
shall have a right to make an application 
to the High Court for necessary direction 
as the High Court may deem fit. 

  
W.P.Nos.61 of 2021  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       8 
S. 17-A. This newly enacted provision 
was with the object to curb the mischief of 
delaying tactics and the Family Court was 
brought under obligation to pass interim 
order, directing the husband to pay 
interim maintenance allowance to the 
children and the wife after filing written 
statement or at any stage thereafter. 
 
The provision of S.21-A was also added 
to the Family Court Act, conferring power 
upon Family Court to preserve and 
protect any property, which is in dispute 
in a suit or any other property of a party 
to the suit for the future satisfaction of the 
decree." 
To further accelerate and expedite the 
disposal of such cases, the District Appeal 
Court and the High Court, orders staying 
the proceedings before the Family Court, 
shall cease to be effective on expiring of 
thirty days time. Again, under section 14, 
through 
amendment, 
it 
was 
made 
mandatory for the Court of Appeal to 
decide the case positively within four 
months.  
  
12. 
Keeping in view the agonies of the parties, 
particularly the wife, in matrimonial disputes to curtail 
the mischief of delay and to shorten the life of litigation 
in such cases, the Law and Justice Commission of 
Pakistan recommended to the Federal Government and 
all the Provincial Governments to establish Family 
Courts in each District and Tehsil Headquarter, which 
shall be preferably presided over by a female Judge so 
that the wives who are not well acquainted and 
familiar with the court proceedings are provided 
maximum protection and friendly environments.”  
(underline for emphasis) 
 
10. 
Contentions raised by the Petitioner in this writ petition are 
patently absurd, which adversely reflected upon his own conduct, who 
consistently is struggling hard to delay the satisfaction of the subject 
decree to deprive his ex-wife and his kids of the fruits of decree. After 
examining the impugned orders, the Court is of the considered view 
that the Executing Court was justified to pass the orders which were 
though assailed in the revision petition before the Additional 

  
W.P.Nos.61 of 2021  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       9 
District Judge, but the same was dismissed by way of order dated 
24.12.2020 and rightly so.  
11. 
In view of above, this petition holds no merit hence the same is 
hereby dismissed.
