ASIM HAFEEZ J. This and connected appeal bearing 
R.F.A No.37623/2022 are directed against decision of 18.05.2022, whereby 
Civil Court, exercising powers under sections 14 and 17 of the Arbitration 
Act 1940 (‘Act, 1940’), made Award dated 13.07.2021 Rule of the Court 
(‘Award’). Aggrieved of the order, two separate appeals are preferred, one

2. 
Facts, essential for the purposes of adjudication of subject matter 
appeals, are that EOBI [appellant], a statutory corporation, established and 
functioning in terms of the provisions of Employees Old Age Benefit Act 
1976, variously offered diverse opportunities for investments across Pakistan 
and one of such venture, being relevant for the purposes of present 
controversy, was the construction of EOBI Hotel and Business Complex 
Project, Lahore. (‘Project’). Respondent No.1 participated in the bidding 
process and found most competitive. Upon fulfilment of pre-contractual 
requirements and procedures contract was awarded on 19.04.2011, bearing 
Contract No.066/01CW/2011 (‘hereinafter referred to as the Contract’), and 
contemporaneously multiple other documents / agreements were executed, 
all forming part of the main contract. Contract was executed between EOBI 
[identified in the contract as Employer] and respondent No.1 [identified in 
the contract as General Contractor]. Notably, Contract, on behalf of the 
Employer, was executed through EOBI’s wholly owned subsidiary, i.e., 
Pakistan Real Estate Investment and Management Company (Pvt). Ltd 
[Appellant in RFA No.37623/2022].     Contractual arrangement proceeded 
on even keel before encountering obstruction – causes thereof need no 
reference being irrelevant for the purposes of present controversy. Disputes 
were papered through reaching a compromise, whereby extension in 
performance of timelines were allowed – commonly referred as first and 
second extensions. Pact reached was short lived and soon differences 

RFA No.43092/2022  
 
-:3:- 
 
resurfaced, and this time events led to the calling for the enforcement of 
bank guarantees. Respondent No.1 approached Civil Court by invoking 
jurisdiction under section 20 of Act, 1940 – clause 20.6 of Particular 
conditions of Contract, dealing with Arbitration. Most crucial fact was that 
petitions under section 20 ibid, were directed against concerned Financial 
Institution(s) and other respondent was PRIMACO [represented to be the 
wholly owned subsidiary of EOBI] - EOBI was not the party to said 
petitions and it never was impleaded as party thereto. With the concurrence 
of the parties, recorded in the order of Civil Court of 24.04.2019, matter was 
referred to the Arbitrators (‘Arbitral Tribunal’), in following terms, 
The arbitrators will settle all outstanding disputes arising out of 
the agreement between the parties, including the issue of 
encashment of bank guarantee, and till such time status qua 
shall be maintained.      
3. 
Arbitration was conducted between PRIMACO and respondent No.1. 
Arbitral Tribunal rendered final Award on 13.07.2021. Respondent No.1 
sought declaration for making it rule of the Court. PRIMACO filed 
objections to the Award inter alia under sections 16, 17, 30 and 33 of the 
Arbitration Act, 1940. On 12.11.2021, EOBI filed application under Order 1 
Rule 10 of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC) and sought permission to 
be impleaded as party to the proceedings. Application was contested by the 
respondent No.1 but same was allowed vide order of 06.01.2022.  
4. 
Upon impleading EOBI as party, the Court allowed EOBI to submit 
objections. Needful was done and thereafter objections of PRIMACO and 
EOBI were dismissed, and Award was made Rule of the Court on 
18.05.2022. Hence instant appeals.

5. 
Learned counsel appearing for appellant (‘PRIMACO’) of RFA 
No.36763/2022, pleads impropriety and invalidity against Award on inter 
alia following grounds: 
(a) 
No notice to the Engineer was issued by the Contractor before 
seeking extension of time and raising claim of additional payments, 
which notice was mandatory in terms of clause 20.1 of the Contract. 
Since no notice was issued within 28 days, hence, no claim for 
extension of time could be allowed. It is alleged that Judgements 
relied upon and referred were not properly appreciated and 
mandatory condition of notice was erroneously reduced as a routine 
requirement.  
(b) 
Quantum of claim allowed is questioned on the premise that neither 
requisite evidence was produced, nor exorbitant claim of additional 
payments was justified. And determination of claim was presumptive 
and not objective. 
(c)  
Award was deficient in material details and matter was required to 
be remitted to the Tribunal in terms of section 26-A of Arbitration 
Act 1940. 
6. 
Learned counsel appearing for respondent No.1 in both appeals, at the 
outset iterated the significance of settlement agreement of 12.03.2020, 
wherein extension in time for performance of works was granted, subject to 
the conditions prescribed. Adds that absence of notice under section 20.1, 
even if treated as requisite condition for raising claim of extension of time 
and additional payments, is inconsequential since the lapse, if any, otherwise 
stood acquiesced in wake of execution of the settlement agreement. Adds 
that waiver qua the requirements of clause 20.1 was even endorsed by the 
Board of EOBI. Learned counsel referred to few clauses of the settlement 
agreement, which, for facility, are reproduced hereunder, 
 
 
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT of 12.03.2020 
 
……. The Parties, notwithstanding the claim for extension 
of time (EOT) pending before the Tribunal, for the purpose of 
continuing the Project agree on an EOT without financial effect for 
a period of fifteen months (15) from the date of release of payment 
as envisaged under clause 4 below. The said extension is a time 
period to complete remaining works on the Project other than on 
hotel and independent of Hotel operator.  

RFA No.43092/2022  
 
-:5:- 
 
This agreement covers only time extension and financial 
implication arising out of same will be presented to the Tribunal 
for determination and award. 
7. 
Submits that Arbitral Tribunal was required to determine the quantum 
of additional claim, which was considered and determined based on the 
empirical evidence available with the Tribunal and furthermore Tribunal had 
rightly relied upon evaluation of claim of additional payments by the 
Engineer with respect to claims raised and allowed at the time of grant of 
first and second extensions of time. Learned counsel further submits that no 
case of misconduct of Arbitral Tribunal or invalidity of Award was made out 
and no illegality or jurisdictional error was committed by the Civil Court 
while exercising powers under section 17 of the Act, 1940. Adds that 
supervisory jurisdiction available, to adjudge Award, does not enable court 
to carry out forensic analysis of quantum of claims awarded. Submits that 
claims awarded otherwise commensurate with the quantum of additional 
payments allowed while allowing first and second extensions. Adds that 
Civil Court extensively dealt with all the objections. Learned counsel placed 
reliance on following decisions reported as FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through 
D.G. National Training Bureau. Vs. MESSRS. JAMES CONSTRUCTION COMPANY (PVT) Ltd. 
(PLD 2018 Islamabad 1), “Al-Haj Sheikh Abdul Hafeez and Another. Vs. SUHAIL ZAMAN and 6

Learned 
counsel 
appearing 
for 
appellant, 
EOBI, 
in 
RFA 
No.43092/2022 and for respondent No.2 in connected appeal, submits that 
contract was executed between respondent No.1 and EOBI, which inter alia 
created rights and obligations for EOBI, but same was not impleaded as 
party to proceedings under section 20 of the Act, 1940, nor represented 
before the Arbitral Tribunal. Submits that Award granted, without EOBI, 
was a nullity. Adds that significance of EOBI was acknowledged by Civil 
Court while allowing its application under Order 1 Rule (10) CPC and once 
EOBI was treated as proper and necessary party, it was imperative for the 
Court to declare the Award invalid, procured without the presence of EOBI. 
Adds that filing of petition under section 20 of the Act, 1940 without EOBI 
constitutes gross illegality and Court, in the circumstances, lacked 
jurisdiction to entertain application and refer the matter to Arbitral Tribunal. 
Submits that factum of non-fulfilment of requirements under section 20, 
ibid, were not appreciated. On merits, learned counsel opposed the quantum 
of claim allowed, calling it unrealistically exorbitant Award.   
9. 
While exercising opportunity to rebut, learned counsels for respondent 
No.1 submit that EOBI – being the principal - had authorized PRIMACO - 
agent – to act for and on its behalf. Adds that agent was none other than a 
wholly owned subsidiary of EOBI, which signed Contract on behalf of 
EOBI, procured bank guarantees in its name and even was allowed to sign 
settlement agreement, terms and conditions whereof were accepted by the 
Board of EOBI. Adds that agent otherwise carried out the assignment in 
accordance with the terms and conditions of Agency Agreement. Adds that 
principal in fact participated, being represented through the agent, in the 

RFA No.43092/2022  
 
-:7:- 
 
arbitration proceedings and agent had not only contested the claim but also 
raised counter claim. Submits that principal cannot, at this stage, question 
the acts and omissions of the agent, when every act and decision of the agent 
was acknowledged, endorsed and approved by the Board of EOBI. Submits 
that EOBI entered in Contract through PRIMACO, and latter was fully 
competent and authorized to contest the claim before the Arbitral Tribunal, 
and to raise objections to the Award. Reference is made to various judicial 
decisions, in the context of the relationship of Principal-Agent and 
repercussions of the acts performed by Agent, which decisions are reported 
as, “National Insurance Property Development Company Limited Vs. NH International 
(Caribbean) Limited” [Claim# CV2008-04881]. “National Highway Authority through 
Chairman, Islamabad Vs. Messrs Sambu Construction Co Ltd Islamabad and others” 
(2023 SCMR 1103). “Concentrate Manufacturing Company of Ireland and 3 others Vs. 
Seven-up-Bottling Company (Private) Limited and 3 others” (2002 CLD 77). “Abdul 
Hameed and others Vs. Abdul Baqi and others” (2021 CLC 1597). “Defence Housing 
Authority, Islamabad Vs. Multi-National Venture Development (Pvt) Ltd” (2019 CLD 
566). 
DETERMINATION BY THE COURT  
10. 
Heard and record perused.  
11. 
Submissions recapitulated; In essence following objections were 
raised against the order of the Civil Court and the Award. Firstly, non-
compliance of requirement of notice to the Engineer, in terms of clause 20.1 
of the Contract was pleaded. Secondly, objections were raised against 
quantum of the claim awarded in the context of allegation of deficient 
evidence in support of claim of additional payments. Third and most critical 

RFA No.43092/2022  
 
-:8:- 
 
was the cause and effect of absence of EOBI as party before the Arbitral 
Tribunal and proceedings initiated under section 20 of the Act of 1940. 
12. 
After hearing the counsels and assessing the merits of the objections 
raised, broadly summed up in preceding paragraphs, it appears that 
allegations of default qua contractual discipline, absence of fulfilment of 
procedural requirements envisaged under clause 20.1 of the Contract and 
scope of determination of monetary claims, in the context of objections of 
deficient evidence and absence of convincing documentary evidence to 
prove claim of additional payments, are material issues but considering the 
context of scope of jurisdiction available under section 30 of the Act, 1940, 
we consider that third question is most crucial and determination thereof is 
fatal to the legality and sustainability of the decree-cum-award. Hence, we 
are deciding these appeals in the context of third objection – effect of 
absence of EOBI, notwithstanding being the party to the agreement, before 
the Arbitral Tribunal and for the purposes of proceedings under section 20 of 
the Act, 1940. Upon decision of third issue, other two issues would have had 
academic importance only. 
13. 
Unchallenged facts are that EOBI was the party to the contract with 
respondent No.1; EOBI was obligated to perform the contractual terms and 
conditions prescribed, which is otherwise the beneficiary of the project and 
owns the liability to discharge the obligations embodied therein. There is no 
dispute that contract was executed through PRIMACO, represented as 
wholly owned subsidiary of EOBI. Article 7 of the Contract provides an 
option of assignment of rights and obligations, subject to the conditions 
prescribed. It is expedient to reproduce Article-7 of the Contract hereunder,  

RFA No.43092/2022  
 
-:9:- 
 
Article7: “No party may assign this Agreement or 
any of its rights and obligations hereunder without 
the prior consent of the other party”. 
14. 
No assignment in terms of Article 7 took place. Article 6 of the 
Contract does not permit oral modification – and no written agreement is 
shown between PRIMOCO and EOBI to shift the rights and obligations of 
contractual arrangement from EOBI to a wholly owned subsidiary. 
Respondent No.1 had not pleaded that rights and obligations of EOBI were 
assigned to PRIMACO, and nor the counsels for PRIMACO had pleaded 
transfer of rights through alleged assignment. Undisputedly, EOBI was not 
impleaded as respondent before Civil Court during proceedings under 
section 20 of the Act, 1940 – only those Financial Institution(s) were 
impleaded which had furnished bank guarantee and other respondent was 
PRIMACO.  
 
To address this issue, learned counsel intensely emphasized on the 
terms of Agency Agreement, executed between EOBI and PRIMACO, who, 
additionally, emphasized with reference to the factum of acknowledgement 
of the Board of EOBI regarding pending Arbitration proceedings, 
appointment and replacement of Arbitrator(s) and approval extended for the 
execution of settlement agreement. Learned counsel elucidated principles 
governing the principal-agent relation and respective rights and obligations, 
especially in the context of the protections available to third parties. Efforts 
are found unproductive. This case has peculiar features and primarily the 
context is the scope of section 20 of the Act, 1940 and effect of not 
impleading one of the parties to the agreement as party to the proceedings 
under section 20, ibid. At the expense of taxing the judgment, it is reiterated, 
in the context of the case at hand, that the relationship of principal and agent 

RFA No.43092/2022  
 
-:10:- 
 
need to be examined in the context of section 20 of the Act 1940, and to be 
interpreted in the company of proximate facts, which peculiarity of facts 
distinguished the ratio of the judgments referred, wherein generic principles 
with respect to principal-agent relationship were discussed. Post-award 
events have had bearing to the controversy, which were that EOBI had 
separately preferred appeal bearing RFA No.43092/2022 and separate appeal 
was preferred by PRIMACO, against single order. Civil Court allowed 
application of EOBI, upon being convinced that EOBI was a necessary / 
proper party for the purposes of proceedings under sections 14 and 17 of the 
Act, 1940. Findings recorded in paragraph 9 of the order of 06.01.2022 are 
sufficient to substantiate the significance of the presence of EOBI. It is 
expedient to reproduce paragraph 9, which read as,   
“9. 
Perusal of record reveals that EOBI is related an institution, which 
was established in the year 1976 under Employees Old-Age Act. It is 
purely for welfare of workers, Old-Age grant, survivor of pensioners and 
invalidity pensions. Respondents/PRIMACO is subsidiary of the 
petitioner/institution and EOBI has certain portfolios of investment to 
meet the expenses of pensionary benefit and matter incidental to meet the 
expenses. Petitioner (EOBI) engaged the respondent/PRIMACO in 
accordance with law. Petitioner/EOBI being an entity having ownership 
and control of the defendant/respondent is a necessary/proper party. 
Petitioner/EOBI being having control of the defendant has the valuable 
rights, which can be effected if the petitioner has not made the party. The 
petitioner has the right to determine the legality of the alleged said matter 
of the plaintiff (M/s Mughals Pakistan Pvt. Ltd). Petitioner/EOBI engaged 
as an agent (M/s Pakistan Real Estate Investment & Management 
Company Pvt. Ltd) to look after under agency agreement dated 
01.01.2013. As per agreement, clause 4 the M/s PRIMACO is liable to 
implement the projects assigned by the EOBI as per time limit and budget 
approved by the EOBI. The project name is EOBI Hotel and Mixed-use 
Development; which is also connected the petitioner in the instant 
petition/suit being a proper party. The said project is still under 
construction and EOBI is being deprived of a handsome income 
opportunity since a lot of years, which is also connect the alleged matter. 
Main contract shows that the petitioner/EOBI as a employer of PRIMACO 
vested the right to be a necessary and proper party. The matter of Bank 
guarantee also relates the petitioner/EOBI as a chairman, EOBI as a 
beneficiary of said guarantee. Under Article 10(A) of the Constitution of 
Pakistan, the petitioner/EOBI has the legal entitlement for hearing and 
provides the record as required by the court to resolve the said 
controversy. Learned counsel in this regard, reference may be made to the 
cases law 2004 MLD 1395 and 2007 SCMR 882, which is relied 
according to the said propositions. In view of the above discussion, 

RFA No.43092/2022  
 
-:11:- 
 
present petition of EOBI stands accepted. Now, to come up for amended 
petition u/s 14 r/w 17 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 with impleading the 
petitioner/EOBI as party for 11.01.2022.” 
 
 
 
 
 
[Emphasis supplied] 
15. 
Whether in view of the findings recorded and reasoning extended to 
justify the order of impleading EOBI as party to the proceedings under 
sections 14 and 17 of the Act, 1940, an act of making the Award rule of the 
court, which award was passed in absence of EOBI, attracts legitimacy. 
Notably, EOBI was allowed to file objections to the Award and one of the 
objection was that since EOBI was not impleaded as party before Tribunal 
therefore matter be remitted to the Arbitrators. Evidently, this conspicuous 
contradiction could not be reconciled, where EOBI was declared as 
necessary / proper party for proceedings under sections 14 and 17 of 
Arbitration Act, 1940 and conversely, while adjudging the validity of the 
Award, same was treated as unnecessary and improper party, either before 
the Arbitration Tribunal or for the purposes of proceedings under section 20 
of Act, 1940. There is no cavil that upon allowing EOBI as necessary/proper 
party to the proceedings, upon granting permission to file objections the 
mutually exclusive status of EOBI and PRIMACO was acknowledged, by 
dint of the judicial order – which order was later disregarded while dealing 
with the objections of EOBI. Indubitably, the myth that PRIMACO, being a 
wholly owned subsidiary of EOBI, was allegedly an alter ego of EOBI was 
dismissed in the wake of impleading of EOBI as party to proceedings under 
sections 14 and 17 of the Act, 1940. In these circumstances, it is an absurdity 
to treat PRIMACO as an alter ego of EOBI for purposes of one set of 
proceedings – in the context of proceedings under section 20 of Act, 1940 - 
and differently for the purposes of proceedings under sections 14 and 17 of 

RFA No.43092/2022  
 
-:12:- 
 
Act, 1940 – where EOBI was declared as necessary/proper party. If 
PRIMACO was an alter ego of EOBI, as alleged, whether both entities can 
prefer the appeals separately. No objection was raised by counsel for 
respondent No.1 with respect to filing of two separate appeals, preferred by 
EOBI and PRIMACO. Now, context of section 20 of the Act, 1940 needs 
sharper focus, which provision is reproduced hereunder for facility, 
Section-20. 
Application to file in Court arbitration agreement. –  
 
(1)  Where any persons have entered into an arbitration 
agreement before the institution of any suit with respect to 
the subject matter of the agreement or any part of it, and 
where a difference has arisen to which the agreement 
applies, they or any of them, instead of proceeding under 
Chapter II, may apply to a Court having jurisdiction in the 
matter to which the agreement relates, that the agreement be 
filed in Court. 
(2)  
The application shall be in writing and shall be 
numbered and registered as a suit between one or more of 
the parties interested or claiming to be interested as plaintiff 
or plaintiffs and the remainder as defendant or defendants, 
if the application has been presented by all the parties, or, if 
otherwise, between the applicant as plaintiff and the other 
parties as defendants. 
(3)  
On such application being made, the Court shall 
direct notice thereof to be given to all parties to the 
agreement other than the applicants, requiring them to show 
cause within the time specified in the notice why the 
agreement should not be filed. 
(4) 
Where no sufficient cause is shown, the Court shall 
order the agreement to be filed, and shall make an order of 
reference to the arbitrator appointed by the parties, whether 
in the agreement or otherwise, or, where the parties cannot 
agree upon an arbitrator, to an arbitrator appointed by the 
Court. 
(5) Thereafter the arbitration shall proceed in accordance 
with, and shall be governed by, the other provisions of this 
Act so far as they can be made applicable. 
[Emphasis supplied] 
16. 
In terms of sub-section (1) of section 20 of the Act, 1940, apparently 
four conditions must be satisfied before the jurisdiction is exercised by the 
court:- 
(i) 
There must be arbitration agreement between 
person(s). 
(ii) 
Agreement was entered before the institution of any 
suit with respect to subject matter of the agreement. 
(iii) A difference has arisen to which agreement applies. 

RFA No.43092/2022  
 
-:13:- 
 
(iv) 
And they or any of them, instead of proceeding 
under Chapter II, may apply to the Court having 
jurisdiction in the matter to which the agreement 
relates.  
 
17. 
In the instant case compliance of aforesaid conditions are found 
missing. By no stretch of imagination PRIMACO could be construed as 
party to the agreement – by pulling it within the ambit of the expressions, 
‘they” or ‘any of them’. Command of sub-section (3) of section 20 of the 
Act, 1940 is clear, which directs that ‘the Court shall direct notice thereof to 
be given to all parties to the agreement other than the applicants. Civil 
Court, before referring the matter to Arbitral Tribunal, failed in its duty to 
ensure notice to the party to the agreement – EOBI. Arbitrators otherwise 
could only be appointed with the consent of the parties to the agreement but 
here presence of one of the party to the agreement [EOBI] was conspicuous 
by its absence – [requirement of sub-section 4 of section 20 of the Act, 1940 
was not fulfilled]. This crucial aspect escaped attention of the Civil Court 
while exercising jurisdiction under sections 14 and 17 of the Act, 1940. We 
have examined the order impugned and find discussion on this issue 
deficient, conjectural and superficial – reference is made to paragraphs 20 to 
25 of the order. Mere knowledge of the Board of EOBI would not satisfy the 
requirements of section 20 of the Act, 1940 nor condone the legal flaw 
occasioned upon referring matter to Arbitral Tribunal, without impleading 
EOBI as party. In the context of the controversy, reference is made to the 
decision reported as “Inayatullah Khan Vs. Obaidullah Khan and others” 
(1999 SCMR 2702), relevant observations are reproduced hereunder, 
“Now we come to the crucial and decisive point in the case which 
is, ‘as to whether arbitration agreement or for that matter a 
consequential award would be valid and binding when it has not 

RFA No.43092/2022  
 
-:14:- 
 
been joined by some of the co-sharers and interested persons?’. The 
answer would definitely be no, because such an award would be 
invalid, void and could not be made basis of a decree.” 
Some pertinent observations are also found in the case of “Sh. Muhammad 
Saleem Vs. Saadat Enterprises” (2009 CLC 291), relevant portion of the 
decision is reproduced hereunder as, 
“The arbitration award has been announced without examining 
that no written agreement was in existence on behalf of company 
for referring the matter to arbitration. Khawaja Safdar Ali, had no 
authority to refer the matter to arbitration. The award, on this score 
alone, is not sustainable in the eyes of law and rightly held so by 
learned trial Court. Participation in arbitration proceedings, if any, 
by Khawaja Safdar Ali, does not validate the proceedings, if his 
participation is without a valid authority. The findings of learned 
trial Court that award cannot be made rule of the Court, as the 
arbitration agreements, which resulted into arbitration proceedings 
and an award, have not been signed on behalf of company, are 
devoid of any illegality or legal infirmity. The reasons, which the 
arbitrators have submitted, are also erroneous conclusions.” 
18. 
Learned counsels for the decree-cum-award holder emphasized that 
PRIMACO is wholly owned subsidiary of EOBI, otherwise being EOBI’s 
agent and duly authorized, obligated, and competent to represent EOBI, 
which facts create binding obligations for the principal - EOBI. Besides 
referring to various clauses of the Contract Act, 1872, much emphasis was 
laid on the terms of Agency Agreement – in fact two agency agreements are 
available on record which are dated 29.06.2007 and 01.01.2013, terms of 
reference qua the scope of services is by and large the same. And it is not the 
case of the decree-cum-award holder that same was not aware of the terms 
of Agency Agreement, which, while making submissions, relied upon the 
contents of the Agency Agreement. Various clauses of the agency agreement 
of 01.01.2013 are reproduced hereunder for convenience, which read as, 
Whereas: - 
(A) 
The Principal is a body corporate providing services to the 
registered establishments and their employees under the Employees 
Old-Age Benefit Act 1976.

(B) 
The Agent is wholly owned subsidiary of the Principal

Operations of real estate investment and management services         
(C)  
The Principal and the Agent have agreed that the Agent 
shall, inter alia, carry out obligation in its respective field of 
expertise on behalf of the Principal in accordance with the term and 
conditions set out in this Agreement.

19. 
Upon examining the terms of Agency Agreement, we are not 
convinced that PRIMACO, for the purposes of clause 26.6 [Particular 
conditions of Contract dealing with Arbitration in case of dispute between 
parties to the agreement] had lawfully substituted EOBI, as party to the 
Contract, for the purposes of proceedings under section 20 of the Act, 1940. 
No assignment of rights and obligations of contract could be claimed by the 
agent, under the Agency Agreement or otherwise by dint of its status as a 
wholly owned subsidiary of EOBI. Respondent No.1 is unable to show that 
how, simplicitor, the status of being a wholly owned subsidiary would make 
PRIMACO as an alternative to EOBI. Simplicitor permission to pursue legal 
affairs was not enough to meet requisite requirements of section 20 of the 
Act, 1940. Signing of the Contract at the behest of EOBI, irrespective of 
being its wholly owned subsidiary, would not make PRIMACO an assignee 
or an alter ego of EOBI. No case for dispensing the necessity of impleading 
EOBI, for the purposes of section 20 of Act, 1940, is made out. It is not 
denied that PRIMACO has an independent legal-cum-corporate existence, as 
iterated in the Agency Agreement. Indubitably, claim of being a wholly 
owned subsidiary of EOBI is clearly indicative of the distinct statuses 
enjoyed and claimed, respectively. Hence, PRIMACO cannot be declared or 
treated as party to the agreement for the purposes of section 20, ibid, 
proceedings, nor same be construed as an entity, which substituted or 
novated EOBI as party to the agreement. No resolution of the Board of 
EOBI is shown or relied upon to demonstrate or establish that PRIMACO 
had the assignment of rights and obligations of EOBI or any novation took 

RFA No.43092/2022

place. No person or an entity, merely being the signatory to the agreement, 
for and on behalf of one of the party to the agreement, was competent to file 
petition under section 20 of the Act, 1940, unless its status as party to the 
agreement is satisfactorily established, by virtue of any law or under any 
contractually arrangement. PRIMACO fails on both counts to claim any 
alleged assignment of rights or novation of contractual obligation. In these 
circumstances, order of referring the matter to Arbitral Tribunal and 
proceedings conducted subsequent thereto, including arbitration proceedings 
and issuance of Award without  EOBI, are found unlawful and invalid. No 
validity could otherwise be extended to the Award in wake of an invalid 
order of reference – guidance is solicited from the decision in the case of 
“PAKISTAN through Ministry of Defence v. Ch. FAZAL MUHAMMAD and others (2005 
YLR 2896) and the case of “Sh. Muhammad Saleem Vs. Saadat Enterprises” (supra). 
No plausible explanation is provided that if PRIMACO was to be treated as 
an alter ego of EOBI, why EOBI was impleaded as necessary / proper party 
to the proceedings under sections 14 and 17 of the Act, 1940. It is nobody’s 
case that Award was exclusively enforceable against PRIMACO, and if 
EOBI was not party to the Award how Award could be enforced against 
EOBI. In the context of the controversy reference is also made to the case of 
“PAKISTAN through Secretary, Ministry of Religious Affairs, Government of Pakistan, 
Islamabad v. DALLAH REAL ESTATE AND TOURISM HOUSING HOLDING 
COMPANY (2003 CLC 1411). The case of “Messrs K & N INTERNATIONAL v. 
Messrs 
MOTORWAY 
OPERATIONS 
AND 
REHABILITATION 
ENGINEERING 
(PRIVATE) LIMITED” (2019 CLC 1613) is also relevant in the context of scope 
of section 20 of the Act, 1940. Civil Court misdirected itself while failing to 
reckon the scope, effect and consequence of order of allowing EOBI to 

RFA No.43092/2022  
 
-:18:- 
 
become party to the proceedings – whereby, on the one hand the Court had 
acknowledged EOBIs status as necessary / proper party and on the other 
made Award rule of the court without considering the effect of absence of 
EOBI, as party before the Arbitral Tribunal. Decree-cum-award holder had 
not challenged order of impleading EOBI as necessary / proper party to the 
proceedings – may be because someone advised not to question the legality 
of order to facilitate enforcement of the Award against EOBI. In these 
circumstances, Award cannot be clothed with any legitimacy. Principle of 
estoppel is otherwise attracted against respondent No.1 in the context of 
acquiescence to the order of Civil Court of impleading EOBI as 
necessary/proper party to the lis. We lay hands on a decision handed down 
by UK Supreme Court in the case of Kabab-Ji SAIL (Lebanon) v. Kout Food 
Group (Kuwait) [2021] UKSC 48, wherein parent company was held not bound 
by an arbitration clause entered in by its subsidiary in absence of any 
novation or variation in the terms of contract and when parent company had 
not acquired any liabilities under the Contract, hence, enforcement of Award 
was refused. And while handing down the judgment, decision – the case of 
‘Egiazaryan and another v. OJSC OEK Finance City of Moscow’ [2015] EWHC 3532 
(Comm) was distinguished in the context of applicable Russian Law and 
distinguishable facts. No case of assignment of rights, novation of contract 
and substitution of EOBI was established. 
20. 
We have examined the order impugned, where Civil Court had 
brushed aside the objections, raised by EOBI against Award, based on bald, 
unjustifiable and erroneous reasoning that PRIMACO was wholly owned 
subsidiary of EOBI, without understanding the concept of a wholly owned 

RFA No.43092/2022  
 
-:19:- 
 
subsidiary company and misconstruing the terms of Agency Agreement, 
especially where the context being the scope of proceedings under section 20 
of the Act, 1940. We have examined the judgments relied upon and referred, 
which are distinguishable and none of the judgment had discussed the 
subject matter issue – absence of EOBI before the Court in the proceedings 
under section 20 of the Act, 1940 and before the Arbitral Tribunal. Generic 
principles, governing principal-agent relationship are not attracted and 
relevant for the purposes of instant appeals. In the context of the facts 
involved, EOBI and PRIMACO need to be construed and treated as 
mutually exclusive entities for the purposes of proceedings under section 20 
of the Act, 1940. Order of upholding of validity of an otherwise invalid 
Award, in wake of the reasoning given, is found unsustainable in law and 
liable to be set-aside. 
21. 
In these circumstances, while exercising jurisdiction under clause (c) 
of section 30 of the Act, 1940, we declare that the Award procured is invalid 
and the decree, making Award rule of the Court, is also unlawful and of no 
legal effect, in wake of illegality of the order of reference of matter to the 
arbitrators, in purported exercise of jurisdiction under section 20 of the Act, 
1940.  
Hence, appeal of EOBI is allowed and that of PRIMACO is disposed 
of being rendered infructuous upon allowing the appeal preferred by EOBI. 
No order as to the costs.
