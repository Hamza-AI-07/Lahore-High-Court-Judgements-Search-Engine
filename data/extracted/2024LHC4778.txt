Date of Hearing:

Petitioner by: 
Malik Babar Saleem, Advocate. 
Respondents No.1  
and 4 by: 
Malik 
Muhammad 
Ali 
Dhol, 
Advocate. 
Respondent No.2(I) 
to 2(II) and 3: 
Proceeded against ex-parte.  
 
      Anwaar Hussain, J.   This Civil Revision is directed against the 
concurrent findings of the Courts below whereby the suit of the 
petitioner for declaration and cancellation of mutation bearing No.54 
dated 31.03.1991 was dismissed, and it has been held that the said 
sale mutation in favour of respondent No.1, namely, Mst. Shama as 
well as the subsequent sale mutation by respondent No. 1 in favour 
of respondent No.4, namely, Imam Bakhsh was valid and not result 
of fraud and misrepresentation.  
2. 
By way of factual background, it has been noted that the 
petitioner is the real mother of respondent No.3, namely, Allah Ditta 
and deceased respondent No.2, namely, Amina Bibi and was the 
owner of the disputed property detail whereof is given in the 
headnote of the plaint. She filed the suit with the averments that she 
is of old age and an illiterate lady and that she neither executed 
General Power of Attorney bearing document No.434/4 dated 
05.12.1987 (“the GPA”), in favour of her son/respondent No.3 nor 
got the same cancelled through any abtalnama, bearing document

C.R. No.1581-D of 2019 
 
 
No.191/4 dated 22.04.2003 and therefore, the impugned mutation 
No.54 dated 31.03.1991 in favour of respondent No.1, by respondent 
No.3 is based on fraud. It is worth mentioning that respondent No.1 
was wife of respondent No.3, however, after sanctioning of the 
impugned mutation, she was divorced and got married to one Raja 
Abdul Rasheed.  The suit was contested by respondents No.1 and 4 
whereas deceased respondent No.2, namely, Amina Bibi and 
respondent No.3 did not file any written statement and were 
proceeded against ex-parte. Issues were framed and evidence was 
led and recorded whereafter through judgment and decree dated 
26.04.2018, the suit was dismissed and appeal preferred by the 
petitioner also met with the same fate, vide judgment and decree 
dated 12.10.2019. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that as many as 11- 
issues, including relief, were framed; however, all the issues have 
not been decided and therefore, the Courts below have erred in law. 
Further contends that even if the GPA is taken to be a genuine 
document, respondent No.3 was obligated to take prior approval of 
the petitioner while selling the property to respondent No.1 who was 
his wife at the relevant time. Places reliance on cases reported as 
“Mst. Shumal Begum v. Mst. Gulzar Begum and 3 others” (1994 
SCMR 818) and “Zahoor Ahmed and 8 others v. Muhammad 
Mehrban and others” (2017 CLC Note 229). 
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for respondents No.1 and 4 has 
supported the impugned findings with the averments that the 
petitioner side has taken a contradictory stance qua the genuineness 
of the GPA. No one has entered appearance on behalf of respondents 
No.2(I) to 2(II) and 3, therefore, they are proceeded against ex-parte.

Relief. 
Issues No.1, 5 and 9 were the core points of determination. Out of 
these issues, the findings on issue No.1 hold the key to the issue 
No.5. Issue No.1 relates to the dispute as to whether the GPA is a 
duly executed and validly registered document or not. In this regard, 
the petitioner took a specific stance in the pleadings that the same 
was result of fraud as it was never executed by her. In para-3 of her 
plaint, it has been averred as under: 
’’3.

                                                      (Emphasis supplied) 
 
However, when she appeared as PW-I, she took a somersault and 
stated as under: 
’’ہی درتس ےہ ہک اتخمر انہم ںیم ےن وخد لسنیک ای رکوا اھت ۔ اس وتق بج ںیم وسنمیخ اتخمر ےئلیک آیئ
 یھت وت ریما اھبیئ اہلل ڈویاای ریمے رمہاہ آای اھت۔ ہی درتس ےہ ہک ررٹسجار ےک روربو ایبن ابتب
وسنمیخ اتخمر ںیم ےن وخد دای اھت۔ ںیم ےن اڑاھیئ اسل لبق ایتخمر وسنمخ رکواای اھت۔‘‘ 
                        (Emphasis supplied) 
It is settled law that the pleadings on their own are mere statement of 
the case by the person and are not a substitute to the evidence. 
Rather, the pleadings determine the contours and circumference 
within which, and in consonance whereof, the parties are to lead 
their respective evidence. Step out of the contours of the pleadings is 
an inhibition and falls foul of the rules and procedure. In case there 
is contradiction and inconsistency, inter se, the pleadings and the 
evidence, the same is mutually destructive to the case. In the present 
case, the petitioner pleaded a specific stance regarding status of the 

5 
C.R. No.1581-D of 2019 
 
 
GPA in her plaint, which was required to be proved. When the 
contents of para-3 of the plaint are put in juxta position with the 
statement of the petitioner reproduced hereinabove, the contradiction 
and inconsistency is self-evident and the case of the petitioner 
squarely falls within the purview of principle envisaged in terms of 
maxim “Allegans Contraria Non Est Audiendus” (A person who 
alleges things contradictory to each other is not to be heard). This 
fact has rightly persuaded the Courts below to dismiss the suit of the 
petitioner.  
7. 
In view of findings on the pivotal issue i.e., issue No.1, the 
second core issue No.5 was not required to be dealt with, separately, 
by giving additional reasoning inasmuch as when the transfer of suit 
property to respondent No. 1 by respondent No. 3 (her ex-husband) 
is held to be valid, her further transfer to respondent No. 4, ipso 
facto, becomes clothed with the validity.  
8. 
Additionally, this Court, in exercise of its revisional and 
corrective jurisdiction, has examined the entire record including 
pleadings of the parties, the statements of witnesses, and the 
documents brought on record. Scanning of the record reveals that the 
GPA, which the petitioner admitted during the course of recording 
of evidence, is a registered document executed, in the year 1987, by 
the petitioner and deceased respondent No.2, who happens to be the 
real daughter and sister of the petitioner and respondent No.3, 
respectively, whereafter the impugned mutation was sanctioned in 
the year 1991 and admittedly, the GPA was cancelled in the year 
2003, by the petitioner only, on the ground that the petitioner has 
lost confidence and trust in her real son-respondent No.3. This is 
where the twist lies. If the stance of the petitioner that she did not 
execute the GPA nor did she got it cancelled and it was result of 
fraud, the knowledge of the same should have rung alarm bells in the 
petitioner to know whether the GPA has been misused or not as the 

6 
C.R. No.1581-D of 2019 
 
 
same was registered in the year 1987 and cancelled in 2003. It runs 
counter to human nature and logic to presume that a person is 
defrauded in executing the GPA just to get registered and not to be 
used. Suffice to observe that whosoever would commit such fraud 
would do so to use it further. Thus, a person fraudulently procuring 
an authority (the GPA in present case) would not wait for a long 
period of 4 years (to sell the property) rather, he would immediately 
move on to reap the fruits of his fraud i.e., the GPA. Case reported 
as “Muhammad Bashir v. Mst. Sattar Bibi and another” (PLD 1995 
LAH 321) is referred in this regard.   
9. 
Moreover, if stance of the petitioner taken in witness box is 
accepted that she got the GPA cancelled herself, then it is 
astonishing that why she did not inquire as to the status of the suit 
property, which had been transferred by her son to his wife. This 
raises a fundamental question as to what efforts were made by the 
petitioner to inquire into the status of suit property from the year 
2003 when she revoked the GPA till the year 2014 when the suit was 
instituted. There is nothing on record in this regard, which leads to 
an ineluctable inference that not only the GPA was genuinely 
executed in favour of respondent No.3 but also said respondent sold 
the suit property to his wife/respondent No.1 with the explicit or 
implicit approval of the petitioner as there was no dispute regarding 
the same till such time respondent No.1 remained in wedlock of 
respondent No.3, which is the reason that the petitioner remained 
mum and  instituted the suit only when respondent No.3 divorced 
respondent No.1. This aspect of the matter gets corroboration from 
the fact that admittedly the petitioner never initiated any criminal 
proceedings against respondent No.3 (her son) for committing fraud. 
Her statement that she had been receiving the share in produce for 2 
½ years prior to the filing of the suit also belies logic inasmuch as if 
she had revoked the GPA in favour of her son in the year 2003, she 

7 
C.R. No.1581-D of 2019 
 
 
has not stated as to who was managing the affairs of the suit 
property and from whom she was receiving the share of produce.  
10. 
There is no cavil to the proposition that an agent who transfers 
the property to his kith and kin (wife in the present case at the 
relevant time) had to seek permission from the principal (the 
petitioner in the present case) and the judgments relied upon by the 
petitioner side are unequivocal pronouncements of the Superior 
Courts in this regard, however, the present case has distinguishable 
facts as highlighted hereinabove inasmuch as in the cases relied 
upon by the petitioner side, either it was the gift, which was effected 
by the attorney or there was allegation of interpolation or fraud qua 
the execution of the GPA as opposed to the present case where a 
contradictory stance has been taken by the petitioner side qua the 
genuineness of the GPA and the petitioner also remained in 
hibernation for a prolonged period since its execution in the year 
1987 and transfer of the suit property in the year 1991 despite the 
fact that she admittedly got cancelled the GPA in the year 2003, 
without carrying out any due diligence and rolled into action only in 
the year 2014 by filing the present suit. The principle embodied in 
the judgments relied upon by the petitioner side lay down a general 
principle which requires prior and/or subsequent approval and 
consent of the principal by an attorney if he intends to transfer the 
property to his kith and kin on the basis of a GPA. The petitioner, by 
not challenging the transaction/transfer in the year 2003, when the 
GPA was got cancelled has exhibited her implicit if not explicit 
approval of the transaction and this case falls under the exception to 
the preceding general principle of law.  
11. 
At this juncture, important issue of limitation also arises, 
which aspect has not been examined by the Courts below although 
in this regard issue No.9 was specifically framed. Question of 
limitation also goes against the petitioner. This Court while 

8 
C.R. No.1581-D of 2019 
 
 
exercising revisional jurisdiction can appraise and determine any 
evidence and/or question not looked into or adjudicated by the 
Courts below. Case reported as “Manager, Jammu & Kashmir, State 
Property in Pakistan v. Khuda Yar and another” (PLD 1975 SC 
678) is referred in this regard. In her plaint, the petitioner has prayed 
for cancellation of the impugned mutation, and a period of three 
years has been prescribed as limitation for a suit for cancellation in 
terms of Articles 91 and 92 of the Part VI of First Schedule to the 
Limitation Act, 1908 (“the Act”). The petitioner having got the 
GPA cancelled in the year 2003, kept quiet for a period of more than 
a decade, and filed the suit in the year of 2014. She has not disclosed 
when she got knowledge of the impugned sale mutation, which 
leaves this Court to infer that she had knowledge of the same when 
she got the GPA cancelled. This makes the suit time barred as it has 
been filed beyond a period of 3 years stipulated in Articles 91 and 92 
of the Act.  
12. 
Moreover, there are concurrent findings of law and facts 
against the petitioner, which are immune from interference by this 
Court in its revisional jurisdiction unless there is some gross 
illegality, irregularity, jurisdictional defect, misreading or non-
reading of evidence therein. Learned counsel for the petitioner has 
failed to point out any such defect in the impugned judgments and 
decrees.  
13. 
In view of what has been discussed above, the instant civil 
revision is dismissed being devoid of merits. No order as to costs.
