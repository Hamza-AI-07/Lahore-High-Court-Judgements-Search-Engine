Date of Hearing 
16.05.2024 
Appellant by: 
In person  
Respondent by: 
Mr. Irfan Javed, Advocate along with the 
respondent 
 
Anwaar Hussain J:  This appeal is directed against judgment 
dated 29.10.2022, passed by the learned Civil Judge 1st Class, Lahore, 
by virtue of which suit of the petitioner for recovery of damages, on 
account of malicious prosecution to the tune of Rs.58,250,000/-, was 
dismissed.  
2. 
By way of factual background, it has been noted that the 
appellant instituted a suit against the respondent with the averments 
that as general attorney of his sister, namely, Mst. Rukhsana Mumtaz, 
the appellant filed a suit for recovery of dowry articles and 
maintenance against the brother and father of the respondent in which 
the Judge Family Court, Lahore appointed Mr. Majid Ali Rana, 
Advocate as Local Commission for submission of his report about the 
condition of the dowry articles lying in the house of the defendants 
but on 21.06.2003 at about 04:00 PM, the respondent alongwith others 
instead of allowing the Local Commission to discharge his duties, as 
directed by the learned Judge Family Court, Lahore attacked the 
appellant and with the collusion of SHO, Police Station, Samanabad, 
Lahore got registered a false and frivolous FIR bearing No.148/2003 
dated 21.06.2003 for offences under Section 452/148/149, 337A1, 
337F3 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860, (“the PPC”) against the 
appellant in which arrest was affected and the appellant was finally 
acquitted on 02.03.2013 and on account of such protracted criminal 
litigation, the respondent is liable to pay damages, as claimed for, 
inter alia,  on account of mental torture, financial and reputational 
loss to the appellant. The suit was contested and after framing the

R.F.A No.80927/2022 
 
 
issues and recording of evidence, the Trial Court dismissed the suit, 
vide impugned judgment dated 29.10.2022.  
3. 
Appellant in person submits that the respondent was aggressor 
and the Trial Court erred in dismissing the suit merely on the ground 
that acquittal of the appellant was on the basis of benefit of doubt. 
Places reliance on the case reported as “Muhammad Yousaf v. Abdul 
Qayyum”1 in support of his contention. He further avers that he was at 
the premises of the respondent pursuant to order of the Family Court 
and, therefore, the attack in itself was malicious and the appellant’s 
act to defend himself, which resulted into any injury to the respondent 
was protected under Section 78 of the PPC. 
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent has supported 
the impugned judgment and states that unless the acquittal is 
honourable and not on the basis of benefit of doubt, a plaintiff of suit 
for recovery of damages on account of malicious prosecution cannot 
succeed if existence of malice in such cases is missing and not proved. 
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
6. 
Following issues were framed by the Trial Court: 
 
“ISSUES 
1. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to recovery of damages 
for 
malicious 
prosecution 
to 
the 
tune 
of 
Rs.5,82,50,000/- on the grounds mentioned in the 
paint?OPP 
2. Whether the suit is not maintainable in its present 
form?OPD 
3. Whether the plaintiff has concealed the true facts of the 
case hence, the same is liable to be dismissed?OPD 
4. Whether the plaintiff has filed this suit just to harass 
and blackmail the defendant?OPD 
5. Whether the plaintiff has no cause of action or locus 
standi to file the present suit?OPD 
6. Relief.” 
 
Evidence was led and recorded. Issue No.1 was core issue and the 
Trial Court found that since the appellant was extended benefit of the 
doubt and was acquitted whereafter the suit was filed, therefore, the 
                                                 
1  (PLD 2016 SC 478) 

 
 
3 
R.F.A No.80927/2022 
 
 
appellant failed to prove that registration of criminal cases is without 
reasonable and probable cause. Operative part of the impugned 
judgment on issue No.1 reads as under: 
“10. The plaintiff could not prove by cogent and 
confidence inspiring evidence that the defendant got 
registered the case against him with malicious 
intention and that there was absence of reasonable 
and probable cause for prosecution launched by the 
defendant against him. Even the plaintiff of this case 
was acquitted by the trial court by extending him 
benefit of doubt and the court did not declare that 
case was baseless. The plaintiff miserably failed to 
discharge the onus of this issue in his favour, so this 
issue is decided against the plaintiff.” 
 
7. 
In a suit for recovery of damages on account of malicious 
prosecution, a plaintiff is obligated to establish following five 
elements as held in case reported as “Niaz and others v. Abdul Sattar 
and others”2: 
(a) 
The prosecution of the plaintiff by the defendant.  
(b) 
There must be a want of reasonable and 
probable cause for that prosecution. 
(c) 
The defendant must have acted maliciously i.e., 
with an improbable motive and not to further 
the ends of justice.  
(d) 
The prosecution must have ended in favour of 
the person proceeded against.  
(e) 
It must have caused damage to the party 
proceeded against.  
 
In so far as the present case is concerned, admittedly, the appellant 
was prosecuted by the respondent and the same ended up in favour of 
the former. Hence, the two of the essential ingredients for establishing 
malicious prosecution, referred at Serial No.(a) and (d) are not 
disputed. We are of the opinion that all prosecutions ending up in an 
acquittal cannot be stated to be malicious as there is no presumption in 
law of a prosecution ending in an acquittal being malicious3. Mere 
averment in a plaint of a suit for damages on account of malicious

(2014 SCC Del 1547)

R.F.A No.80927/2022 
 
 
prosecution that the plaintiff was prosecuted by or at the instance of 
the defendant in the suit and was acquitted would not formulate 
malicious prosecution. Hence, the nub of the matter is to determine 
whether, in the facts and circumstances of the case, it can be accepted 
that there was reasonable and probable cause with the respondent for 
the registration of criminal case against the appellant in which the 
latter has been acquitted, on account of benefit of doubt.  
8. 
The term “malice” means the presence of some improper and 
wrongful motive - that is to say, an intent to use the legal process in 
question for some objective other than its legally appointed and 
appropriate purposes.4 Malicious prosecution means to obtain a 
collateral advantage. It is rather, always dependent on the facts that 
whether such prosecution was based on malice or not. The act of a 
defendant is to be seen, that is to say, was it by spite or ill will or any 
indirect or improper motive. Malice can be presumed from the facts as 
they emerge from the evidence recorded during the trial. Mere 
absence of reasonable and probable cause does not justify, as a matter 
of law, the conclusion that the prosecution was malicious, though it is 
quite conceivable that the evidence which is sufficient to prove 
absence of reasonable and probable cause may also establish malice.5 
Moreover, malice alone would not be enough. The plaintiff in a suit 
for malicious prosecution must also establish absence of “reasonable 
and probable cause” and the onus to prove thereof is always on the 
person who asserts in affirmative -the appellant in the present case. 
The term “reasonable and probable cause” means that the prosecutor 
in a criminal case had an honest belief in the guilt of the accused, 
based on reasonable grounds6. If “the reasonable and probable cause” 
is established, question of malice becomes irrelevant7. The conditions 
precedent for filing the suit for malicious prosecutions are the 
aforesaid conditions, which should coexist before the defendant in 
such suit for malicious prosecution can be burdened with liability.

9. 
No doubt it is true that the acquittal of a person in a criminal 
case sometimes gives presumption that there was no reasonable cause 
for his prosecution, but this presumption is rebuttable and there cannot 
be any universally accepted phenomenon that in case the criminal 
prosecution fails, then the accused would be automatically entitled for 
recovery of damages as otherwise in all those cases where the 
prosecution fails, it would give rise to damages in favour of an 
accused. Therefore, the nature of acquittal has to be kept in view as 
well. Meaning thereby that whether the acquittal was by way of giving 
a benefit of doubt or it was based on weakness of evidence or whether 
it was an acquittal on merits. As to what precisely is meant by 
“acquittal on merits” in strict sense, is not quite clear. An acquittal on 
the ground of extreme weakness of the prosecution evidence can also 
be treated as an acquittal on merits. But it is indeed true that an 
acquittal by way of giving benefit of doubt is an acquittal which is not 
on merits. The present is a case where benefit of doubt was given to 
the appellant, in the criminal case registered against him by the 
respondent while making a clear observation that both sides appeared 
to be at fault. Operative part of the judgment in criminal case, dated 
02.03.2013 passed by Judicial Magistrate Section-30, Model Town, 
Lahore reads as under:  
“15. Therefore, there is doubt about the role of each 
accused. Hence, by giving benefit of doubt, accused 
Sh. Tariq Mehmood is hereby acquitted from the 
charge. He is on bail. His sureties are re-called. 
Accused Sohail Ahmad is court absconder. Evidence 
U/S 512 Cr.P.C has already been recorded against 
accused Sohail Ahmad. Till his arrest, case file be 
consigned to record room.” 
 
10. 
Keeping in view the above exposition qua essential ingredients 
for obtaining decree in case of suit for malicious prosecution, we are 
of the opinion that reliance placed by the appellant on case of 
Muhammad Yousaf supra is misplaced. In fact, the respondent side 
has also relied on the said judgment. In the said case, the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court while examining the concept of malicious prosecution 
and registration of a false FIR observed as under: 

 
 
6 
R.F.A No.80927/2022 
 
 
“9.  This has meant that the plaintiff has had to 
establish, inter alia, malice as well as absence of 
reasonable and probable cause to succeed in a 
claim for malicious prosecution. Mere absence 
of reasonable and probable cause' has not been 
held to be sufficient to establish malice, although 
it can be used as evidence for establishing malice. 
Malice is a state of mind and can be inferred 
from the circumstantial evidence. We can take 
judicial notice of our societal norms which 
appears to be at variance on norms of English 
society. The mere lodging of an FIR creates a 
public perception adverse to the reputation of the 
accused. Where the FIR is proved either to be 
false or to have been lodged without reasonable 
and probable cause, the circumstances of any 
given case may be sufficient to show that the 
lodging of the criminal case was malicious. For 
instance, in certain cases a prior enmity or a 
family dispute or differences between the families 
of two spouses can lead to the lodging of a 
criminal case and initiation of a prosecution based 
on allegations of a factual nature which are 
motivated by the aforesaid circumstances rather 
than a truthful assertion of fact to bring an 
accused to book through the criminal legal 
process. In the present case, the falsity of the 
allegation made against the respondent/plaintiff 
is established from the fact that the only basis 
stated by him for lodging the FIR was some 
information received by him from a person 
named Sadiq, after the FIR had been registered. 
Since the said Sadiq was not summoned and 
produced 
as 
a 
witness 
by 
the 
petitioner/defendant the element of malice on 
the part of the petitioner can be inferred. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
Unlike the case of Muhammad Yousaf supra, in the instant case the 
FIR was registered by the respondent in respect of an actual 
occurrence which the appellant admits albeit that the respondent was 
the attacker/aggressor and the injuries caused to the respondent was 
result of the self defence and for this reasons reliance is placed by the 
appellant on Sections 78 and 79 of the PPC. The appellant averred 
that the presence of the appellant at the residence of the respondent 
was in furtherance of an order of the Family Court for inspection of 
dowry articles belonging to the sister of the appellant, at the house of 

 
 
7 
R.F.A No.80927/2022 
 
 
the respondent, who was real brother of ex-brother in law of the 
appellant and the Family Court concerned, where the suit of the sister 
of the appellant was pending, appointed a Local Commission namely, 
Mr. Majid Ali Rana, Advocate to examine the said dowry articles and 
when the appellant reached the house of the respondent, the latter 
attacked that resulted into injuries. Even if the said averments are 
accepted, it depicts that the occurrence was not fabricated, illusionary, 
fictitious on account of any hearsay and, certainly, constitutes 
reasonable and probable cause for the prosecution and it is only on 
account of weak evidence, the benefit of doubt was given to the 
appellant. Moreover, only affidavit of said Local Commission was 
brought on record and he was not produced as witness and appellant’s 
application was dismissed in this regard, vide order dated 10.01.2007. 
Said order was not challenged. Even otherwise, in his statement 
brought on record, it has been acknowledged by Local Commission 
that occurrence did take place. Meaning thereby that the FIR was 
registered for a reasonable and probable cause and not on mere 
assumptions. Moreover, Local Commission acted in furtherance of 
order of the Family Court, Lahore and nothing has been brought on 
record to establish that said Family Court took any action against the 
delinquents. 
11. 
At this juncture, it would be imperative to examine the concept 
of “the benefit of the doubt”. It is a principle that allows for the 
possibility that someone or something may not be innocent or truthful, 
even if there is not enough evidence to prove it. It is often used in 
situations where there is uncertainty or doubt about someone's actions 
or intentions. Acquittal on extension of the benefit of the doubt does 
not mean that the accused were falsely implicated and possibility 
would not be excluded that the accused might also have been involved 
in the matter but for want of evidence beyond doubt was not led by 
the prosecution so as to effect conviction.8

and 2 others (1991 SCMR 2220).

12. 
In view of the preceding discussion, we are of the view that the 
Trial Court has correctly appreciated the evidence on record as also 
the applicable law. The present appeal has no merits and hence, the 
same is dismissed. No order as to costs.
