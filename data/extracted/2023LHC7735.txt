Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – Through this application, the 
Petitioner, Musawar Hussain, seeks pre-arrest bail in case FIR 
No.1465/2023 dated 11.8.2023 registered at Police Station Saddar 
Muridke, District Sheikhupura. The said FIR was initially registered for 
an offence under section 365-B PPC but during investigation sections 
420, 468 & 471 PPC were added vide Case Diary No.29 dated 
24.11.2023. 
2. 
 
According to the Complainant, Sabir Ali, his sister Humaira 
Bibi married the Petitioner about nine years ago, and they had two 
children. On 30.7.2023, the Petitioner abducted his younger sister, 
Sumaira Bibi, who is about 18 years old, and forced her to marry him 
unlawfully. The Complainant alleged that the Petitioner‟s marriage with 
Sumaira was ab initio void because his prior marriage with Humaira was 
still in effect. Sabir Ali claims that Shariah law prohibits an individual 
from simultaneously having two biological sisters in a nuptial bond. 
Consequently, he lodged FIR No. 1465/2023, seeking criminal 
proceedings against the Petitioner and requesting appropriate legal 
punishment. 
3. 
 
The Petitioner has termed FIR No. 1465/2023 mala fide. He 
claims he has not committed any offence because he divorced Humaira on 
10.7.2023 and married Sumaira subsequently on 19.7.2023. During the

investigation, he submitted copies of the Divorce Deed and Nikahnama to 
the Investigating Officer, which he has also appended with the present 
bail application. 
4. 
 
The following two legal questions arise in this case: 
i) 
Is it permissible for an individual to marry two real 
sisters concurrently? 
ii) 
Can an individual marry the sister of his divorced wife 
while the latter is undergoing the Iddat period? 
The first question 
5. 
 
Different religious and belief systems worldwide have 
varying views on marriage. Some may consider it as a sacred covenant, 
while others view it primarily as a social or cultural institution. In Islam, 
marriage is not only a social contract but also a religious covenant 
fulfilling both spiritual and worldly purposes. It is a sacred bond that 
fosters companionship, mutual support, and the fulfilment of natural 
desires while adhering to the principles of the faith. The Quran says: 
“And marry those among you who are single and those who are fit 
among your male slaves and your female slaves; if they are needy, 
Allah will make them free from want out of His Grace.” 
(Surah Al-Nur 24:32) 
“And among His signs is that he created for you mates from among 
yourselves, that you may dwell in tranquility with them, and He put 
love and mercy between your hearts. Verily, in that are signs for those 
who reflect.” 
(Surah Al-Rum 30:21) 
The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) said: 
“Men marry women for their  piety or property or their beauty, but ye 
marry for piety.” 
(Tirmazi, Jami 1331) 
6. 
 
In Islam, the emphasis on upholding the sanctity of marriage 
and adherence to the principles of chastity and fidelity is unequivocal. The 
Quran‟s teachings and the Prophet Muhammad‟s traditions guide Muslims 
towards virtuous conduct in marital relationships. The prohibition against 
premarital and extramarital relationships is not merely a matter of moral 
guidance but is deeply ingrained in the legal and ethical framework of 
Islam. The gravity of engaging in illicit sexual relations is underscored by 

Crl. Misc. No.67328/B/2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3 
 
the classification of such acts as Zina, a sin regarded with utmost severity 
in Islamic jurisprudence. This uncompromising stance reflects Islam‟s 
commitment to promoting ethical behaviour, safeguarding the dignity and 
rights of individuals, and maintaining the integrity of family structures 
within society. 
7. 
 
The Holy Quran delineates specific restrictions on marriage, 
particularly concerning certain categories of women. In Iftikhar Nazir 
Ahmad 
Khan 
and 
others 
v. 
Ghulam 
Kibria 
and 
others  
(PLD 1968 Lahore 587), Muhammad Akram J. identified nineteen classes 
of women with whom marriage is prohibited.1 These prohibitions, known 
as “Moharramat”, encompass various familial and social relationships, 
ranging from mothers and daughters to married women and idolaters. 
Such restrictions aim to preserve domestic harmony, prevent conflicts, 
and uphold moral integrity within the Muslim community. Importantly, 
these prohibitions are classified into two categories: perpetual and 
temporary. Perpetual prohibitions arising from consanguinity, fosterage, 
and affinity are absolute and eternal, leaving no room for exceptions. 
Conversely, temporary prohibitions arise from impediments that are not 
permanent, allowing for the potential removal of obstacles to marriage.2 
The temporary prohibitions are against (i) exceeding the number of wives 
allowed by law, (ii) conjunction of two sisters, (iii) conjunction of a free 
woman and a slave girl, (iv) marriage with an idolatress, (v) marriage with 
another‟s wife, (vi) marriage with another‟s Moattada (in the Iddat of 
another); (vii) conjunction of two such females as could not have 
intermarried, if one of them was a male. 
8. 
 
The Hanafi jurists delineate marriages into three distinct 
categories: Saheeh, fasid, and batil – depending upon their validity and 
effect. Saheeh is commonly translated as “valid”, while fasid is 
                                                 
1 These 19 classes are: (i) Mothers; (ii) Daughters; (iii) Sisters; (iv) Father‟s sister; (v) Mother‟s sister; (vi) Brother‟s 
daughter; (vii) Sister‟s daughter; (viii) Foster-mother; (ix) Foster-sister; (x) Mother-in-law; (xi) Wives‟ daughters  
(step-daughters); (xii) Son‟s wives; (xiii) Father‟s wife (step-mother); (xiv) Two sisters in conjunction; (xv) married 
women; (xvi) Idolatress (Mushrikat); (xvii) One‟s thrice divorced wife; (xviii) a woman in Iddat; (xix) more than four 
wives. 
2 Fatawa-e-Kazi Khan (pages 167-169), in the „Chapter on Muharramat‟ (women forbidden to be married), has elaborated 
on this broad division into the two classes of women: mo-abbada (permanently prohibited) and ghair-mo-abbada 
(temporarily prohibited) women in marriages. 

Crl. Misc. No.67328/B/2023

interpreted as “invalid” or “irregular”, and batil as “void”. These terms 
carry nuanced meanings in Islamic jurisprudence that transcend simplistic 
English translations. Therefore, using the original Islamic terminology 
whenever possible is advisable, as relying solely on translations may lead 
to misunderstandings, especially regarding the term fasid. “Irregular” 
suggests some procedural flaw, “which does not fit within the scheme of 
Islamic law and jurisprudence. Fasid cannot be equated with mere 
irregularity as employed and used under the common law.”3 
9. 
 
The distinction between the above-mentioned classifications 
is crucial because it determines the legal status and consequences of 
matrimonial unions under Hanafi law. A Saheeh marriage is free from all 
defects. It impeccably conforms with all the requirements laid down by 
the Shariah, e.g., the existence of the proposal and acceptance, the 
presence of the witnesses, and the competency of the parties involved. 
Such marriages yield lawful and binding consequences for the parties 
involved. Conversely, batil marriages are those which are deemed void 
from their inception due to fundamental defects. These marriages lack 
essential elements required by Shariah, rendering the proposal and 
acceptance devoid of legal effect. Consequently, batil marriages are 
unlawful unions which fail to produce any legal consequences. Situated 
between these two extremes are fasid marriages, characterized by defects 
that compromise their validity to a certain extent.  
10. 
 
It is easy to classify marriages as Saheeh, batil, and fasid in 
terms of their definitions, but their practical application poses serious 
challenges. Muhammad Akram J. observes that some Hanafi jurists have 
conflated the concepts of fasid and batil marriages, using these terms 
interchangeably. However, recent authors have diligently recognized and 
preserved their precise technical meanings in legal discourse.4 
11. 
 
Since there is a clear distinction between batil and fasid 
marriages in Islamic jurisprudence, it is necessary to delve into the rights 
and obligations of the parties involved. Before consummation, both batil

and fasid marriages are considered nugatory and have no legal effect. In 
the case of a fasid marriage, the absence of consummation means that 
there is no requirement for Iddat for the woman, nor is she entitled to the 
dower. However, certain legal consequences ensue once consummation 
occurs. The woman is obligated to observe Iddat following the dissolution 
of the marriage. Furthermore, she is entitled to the customary or the 
specified dower, whichever is less, and Nasab (paternity) is established if 
a child is born to the couple. While there is no Hadd (the specific 
punishment for Zina) for engaging in a fasid marriage, the parties 
involved may still face the consequences under Tazir, a discretionary 
sentence imposed by the Qazi. The severity of Tazir is contingent upon 
the circumstances of each case, serving as a corrective measure to deter 
future transgressions and uphold societal norms. The parties to a fasid 
marriage are under a liability to separate as soon as Fasad (illegality) 
appears or becomes known to them. If they do not, it is the Qazi‟s 
responsibility to separate them and dissolve their marriage immediately. 
In Iftikhar Nazir’s case, supra, a Division Bench of this Court quoted with 
approval the following excerpt from Fatawa-i-Alamgiri:5 
“When a marriage is found to be invalid, the Kazi „should effect 
separation between the husband and the wife. In case there has been no 
cohabitation, the wife shall not be entitled to a dower nor will she be 
required to serve out the period of probation (Iddat). But in case there 
has been copulation between the husband and the wife the latter shall 
get the dower specified for her, or the one customary in her family 
(mahr-ul-misl), whichever is the lesser one. The mahr will be allowed 
only in case it has been fixed, she will get mahr-ul-misl, no matter what 
it may be in amount. In this case, the woman shall have to undergo the 
period of probation and only the sexual intercourse shall be allowed 
that has been made and the man has fully enjoyed the object of his 
contract. The period of Iddat shall be computed from the time the 
cancellation of nikah has been made between the pair. This is the 
opinion held by the three Imams, vide the Mohit.” 
 
 
Hedaya,6 Kanz-ud-Dakik,7 Sharh-i-Vikaya,8 and Digest of 
Mohammedan Law by Baillie9 state the same principle of law.

In Surah Al-Nisa (4:23), the Quran forbids a person from 
marrying two sisters simultaneously, stating: 
“Prohibited to you (for marriage) are: your mothers, daughters, sisters; 
father‟s sisters, mother‟s sisters; brother‟s daughters, sister‟s daughters; 
foster-mothers (who gave you suck), foster-sisters; your wives‟ 
mothers; your step-daughters under your guardianship, born of your 
wives to whom ye have gone in, no prohibition if ye have not gone in; 
(those who have been) wives of your sons proceeding from your loins; 
and two sisters in wedlock at one and the same time, except for what is 
past; for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.” 
13. 
 
Hadith No. 1129 in Sunan Tirmazi, which is reproduced 
below, is also instructive: 
ریفوز دیملی ریض اہلل ہنع ےتہک ںیہ ہک ںیم یبن ارکم یلص   اہلل ہیل و مل ے ساس ی،ا  ںیم ے ضر  :ای

 وت روسل اہلل یلص اہلل

14. 
 
There is a consensus amongst Muslim jurists that the 
conjunction of two sisters is Haram, one of the gravest sins. However, 
there is a difference of opinion on whether such marriage is batil or fasid. 
The majority of the Hanafi jurists lean towards categorizing it as fasid. 
Syed Ameer Ali writes:10 
“Thus, with regard to women who cannot be married by a man at the 
same time, or to use the language of Arabian lawyers, “who cannot be 
lawfully joined together,” connection with them is not unlawful in itself 
but only for a temporary or incidental circumstance. For example, a 
man is not allowed to marry two women so related to each other that if 
one of them had been a man, they could not intermarry, but he can at 
any time make the second woman lawful to himself by divorcing the 
first, or the first may die which would remove the bar to the second 
marriage.”  
15. 
 
Paragraph 263 of D.F. Mulla’s Principles of Mahomedan 
Law classifies a marriage through unlawful conjunction as irregular  
(read: fasid) rather than void. It states: 
263. 
Unlawful conjunction. – A man may not have at the same time 
two wives who are so related to each other by consanguinity, affinity or 
fosterage, that if either of them had been a male, they could not have 
lawfully intermarried, as for instance, two sisters, or aunt and niece. 
The bar of unlawful conjunction renders a marriage irregular, not void. 
16. 
 
In summary, the differentiation between batil and fasid 
marriages carries substantial legal consequences, both civil and criminal. 
Civil liabilities are not an issue in the present case, so they shall be

discussed in some other proceedings. Regarding criminal liability arising 
out of a marriage involving the marriage of two sisters, most Hanafi 
jurists, including Imam Abu Hanifa (R.A), argue that such unions do not 
warrant the imposition of Hadd punishment. However, they are 
unanimous that considering its serious repercussions, it must be dealt with 
seriously, and Tazir must be inflicted.11 
The second question 
17. 
 
In Islam, a Talaq can be effected through several methods, 
each having its own conditions and procedures. According to  
D.F. Mulla’s Principles of Mahomedan Law, the first method, Talaq 
Ahsan, involves a single pronouncement of divorce made during a Tuhr, 
which is the period between menstruations. After this pronouncement, 
there must be a period of abstinence from sexual intercourse for the 
duration of the Iddat, or waiting period. Talaq Ahsan can still be 
pronounced if the marriage has not been consummated, even if the wife is 
menstruating. However, if the wife has reached menopause, the 
requirement of pronouncement during a Tuhr does not apply. 
Additionally, this requirement only pertains to oral divorce, not written 
divorce. 
The 
second 
method, 
Talaq 
Hasan, 
requires 
three 
pronouncements made during successive Tuhrs, with no sexual 
intercourse occurring during any of the three Tuhrs. The first 
pronouncement must occur during one Tuhr, the second during the next 
Tuhr, and the third during the Tuhr following that. Finally, Talaq-ul-
Bidaat or Talaq-i-Badai, the third method, involves either three 
pronouncements made during a single Tuhr, either in one sentence or 
separately, or a single pronouncement during a Tuhr that clearly indicates 
an irrevocable intention to dissolve the marriage. Examples include 
pronouncing “I divorce thee thrice” or “I divorce thee irrevocably.” 
18. 
 
It is a well-established principle of Islamic jurisprudence that 
Talaq is not effective until the expiration of Iddat. Surah Al-Baqara  
(2:228) says: 
                                                 
11 Mst. Adeela Bibi and another v. State and 4 others (PLJ 2012 Islamabad 140).

“Divorced women shall wait concerning themselves for three monthly 
periods. And it is not lawful for them to hide what Allah Hath created 
in their wombs, If they have faith in Allah and the Last Day, And their 
husbands have the better right to take them back in that period, if they 
wish for reconciliation. And women shall have rights similar to the 
rights against them, according to what is equitable; But men have a 
degree over them and Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise. 
19. 
 
Then, Surah Al-Baqara (2:230) states: 
“So if a husband divorces his wife (irrevocably). He cannot, after that, 
re-marry her until after she has married another husband and he has 
divorced her. In that case, there is no blame on either of them if they re-
unite, provided they feel that they can keep the limits ordained by 
Allah. Such are the limits ordained by Allah, which He makes plain to 
those who know.” 
20. 
 
Surah Al-Talaq (65:1) commands: 
“O Prophet! When ye do divorce women, divorce them at their 
prescribed periods, and count (accurately) their prescribed periods: and 
fear Allah your Lord: and turn them not out of their houses, nor shall 
they (themselves) leave, except in case they are guilty of some open 
lewdness, those are limits set by Allah: and any who transgresses the 
limits of Allah, does verily wrong his (own) soul: thou knowest not if 
perchance Allah will bring about thereafter some new situation.”  
21. 
 
Explaining Surah Al-Talaq (65:1), supra, in Muhammad 
Arif v. The State (PLD 1982 FSC 292), the Federal Shariat Court stated 
that the prohibition against expelling the woman during the Iddat by the 
husband and the explicit restriction on the woman leaving her husband‟s 
house herself during this period indicate that after the pronouncement of 
Talaq, where the marriage has been consummated, the woman remains 
bound by the marital contract until the prescribed Iddat period specified 
by the Quran and Sunnah has lapsed. This is also why the woman is 
entitled to maintenance during this period. Additionally, if either spouse 
passes away before the completion of the Iddat period, the surviving 
spouse is entitled to inherit from the deceased‟s estate. As a result, jurists 
have a consensus that a person cannot marry his ex-wife‟s sister until her 
Iddat period has ended. After citing various authorities, the Federal 
Shariat Court concluded:

The above dictum was followed in Kundan Mai v. The State 
(PLD 1988 FSC 89) and Adeela Bibi and another v. The State and others 
(PLJ 2012 Islamabad 140). 
22. 
 
Section 7(3) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 is 
based on the same principle. It stipulates that unless revoked earlier, 
expressly or otherwise, Talaq shall not be effective until ninety days12 
have elapsed from the day on which notice under section 7(1) is delivered 
to the Chairman of the Union Council.13 If the wife is pregnant when 
Talaq is pronounced, it shall not be effective until the period mentioned 
above expires or the pregnancy ends, whichever is later. 
23. 
 
If, contrary to Shariah law, a person marries the sister of his 
divorced wife while she is in the Iddat period, there is no bar on him 
entering into a new marriage contract with that woman after his ex-wife‟s 
Iddat period ends. Mufti Dr. Khaleeq-ur-Rehman posits: 
                                                 
12 In Allah Dad v. Mukhtar and another (1992 SCMR 1273), the Shariat Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan highlighted that according to Surah Al-Baqara (2:228), the Iddat period prescribed by the Holy Quran is not 
strictly 90 days, but rather encompasses three menstrual cycles, which may not necessarily span 90 days. Hanafi jurists 
stipulate that the minimum duration of menstruation is three days, and the minimum duration of Tuhr (period of purity) is 
15 days. Based on these principles, the minimum Iddat period could be 39 days, allowing for three menstrual cycles with 
two intervening periods of purity. Thus, a marriage conducted 39 days after the divorce may be deemed valid according to 
Shariah if the woman has completed three menstrual cycles during this time. The Holy Quran and the Sunnah of the Holy 
Prophet (peace be upon him) do not specify 90 days as the Iddat period, except for women who have ceased menstruation 
due to old age or who have not yet started menstruating due to their young age, whose Iddat is mentioned as three lunar 
months (See Quran 65:4). 
13 In Syed Ali Nawaz Gardezi v. Lt.-Col. Muhammad Yusuf (PLD 1963 SC 51), the Supreme Court held that the object of 
section 7 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961 is to prevent hasty dissolution of marriages by Talaq, pronounced 
unilaterally by the husband, without attempting to prevent the disruption of the matrimonial status. If the husband himself 
reconsiders the pronouncement of Talaq and refrains from giving notice to the Chairman, he should perhaps be deemed, 
in view of section 7 of the Ordinance, to have revoked the pronouncement, which would benefit the wife. Subsequently, 
in Allah Dad v. Mukhtar and another (1992 SCMR 1273), the Shariat Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court held that a 
notice under section 7 is not mandatory, and divorce becomes effective upon completion of the Iddat period under Islamic 
law, which may be less than 90 days (minimum 39 days). 
Later on, the matter once again came under consideration before the Supreme Court in Kaneez Fatima v. Wali 
Muhammad and another (PLD 1993 SC 901). It discussed both the above judgments, pointing out that the jurisdiction of 
the Federal Shariat Court and the Shariat Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court does not extend to the Constitution and 
Family laws. Therefore, the court in Allah Dad’s case should have decided the matter based on the principles outlined in 
Mst. Bashiran and others v. Muhammad Hussain and another (PLD 1988 SC 186), which it referred to in its judgment.  
“As Allah Dad’s case could be decided on the principles of Mst. Bashiran’s case, there was no need to enter into 
constitutional issues, particularly when it did not fall within the jurisdiction of the court.” 
Regarding Syed Ali Nawaz Gardezi, the Supreme Court observed that failure to send notice of Talaq to the Chairman of 
the Union Council does not automatically lead to the conclusion that Talaq has been revoked. It may only render it 
ineffective but not revoked. This controversy should be considered from a practical and purposive point of view, taking 
into account the facts and circumstances of each case. The Supreme Court noted that the provisions of section 7 of the 
Ordinance have remained controversial from the very beginning, with conflicting views in general. Due to constitutional 
restraints, the courts cannot issue any verdict on conflicting claims challenging or justifying the provisions of section 7 of 
the Ordinance. However, the applicability and interpretation of section 7 must be construed in light of the facts of each 
case. In a case where divorce is effected and confirmed in writing with the consent of both parties, section 7 should not be 
strictly interpreted, particularly in cases where the penal provision of section 7(2) is to be enforced because in such cases, 
the parties do not willfully breach the law and genuinely believe that they have been divorced with each other‟s consent. 
Sending notice to the Chairman of the Union Council is considered merely a formality in such instances. The notice can 
be sent at any time thereafter to comply with the provisions of section 7. Where such a view has been taken but its 
validity has been challenged, the court would be justified in refusing to issue a writ and exercise its jurisdiction.

The case at hand 
24. 
 
The Petitioner, Musawar Hussain, faces an accusation of 
simultaneously marrying two real sisters, Humaira and Sumaira. While 
this marriage is deemed fasid rather than batil, it still carries culpability. 
The Petitioner‟s defence hinges on his claim that he divorced Humaira on 
10.7.2023 before marrying Sumaira on 19.7.2023. However, this defence 
falls short as the marriage took place before the completion of Humaira‟s 
Iddat period. This situation parallels the conjunction of two sisters during 
the subsistence of the first sister‟s marriage, which entails criminal 
liability. 
25. 
 
During the investigation, the Petitioner provided a photocopy 
of the Divorce Deed dated 10.7.2023. The Investigating Officer 
repeatedly asked him to produce the original document but he did not. 
Shockingly, the Investigating Officer discovered that the deed was neither 
registered with the relevant Union Council nor recorded in the stamp 
vendor‟s register despite bearing his rubber stamp on the back. 
Considering these circumstances, he added sections 420, 468, and 471 
PPC in the FIR through Case Diary No.29 dated 24.11.2023. Out of these, 
section 420 PPC is cognizable. 
26. 
 
Mr. Ahmad contends that the police wrongly registered FIR 
No. 1465/2023 under section 365-B PPC. According to him, at most, the 
facts of the case attracted section 496 PPC, which is a non-cognizable and 
bailable offence. In the circumstances, the said FIR was non est and a 

Crl. Misc. No.67328/B/2023

non-starter. The inclusion of section 420 PPC, a cognizable offence, 
during the investigation does not rectify the initial defect. Hence, no 
prosecution can be carried out based on the said FIR. However, Mr. 
Ahmad‟s argument overlooks a crucial detail. The Complainant 
specifically alleged in the FIR that the Petitioner abducted Humaira and 
coerced her into an illicit marriage. Thus, from the contents of the FIR, 
section 365-B PPC was made out. Since it is a cognizable offence, the 
police were justified in registering the FIR. It is well established that 
when a person approaches the officer in-charge of a police station to 
register an FIR, the determining factor for him is whether the information 
laid before him pertains to the commission of a cognizable offence. If, 
during the investigation, it turns out that a non-cognizable offence, rather 
than a cognizable offence, had been committed, it does not invalidate the 
proceedings, as the provisions of section 155 Cr.P.C. do not apply. 
27. 
 
I have dismissed the Petitioner‟s application for pre-arrest 
bail by a short order dated 27.11.2023. Above are the reasons therefor. 
28. 
 
The observations made in this order on the factual aspects of 
the case are tentative. The learned trial court shall decide the case in light 
of the evidence produced during the trial without being prejudiced by 
these observations.
