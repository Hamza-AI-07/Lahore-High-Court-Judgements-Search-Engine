Anwaar Hussain, J.  Pursuant to the advertisement 
dated 15.12.2020 published by respondent No.2, for recruitment to 
the post of Constables/Lady Constables in Punjab Police 
Department, District Gujranwala, the name of the petitioner, on the 
recommendation of the Recruitment Board, was reflected at serial 
No. 51 of the final list of candidates as the petitioner had passed 
through the physical test, written exam and the interview. However, 
the said list was subject to medical fitness, verification of 
antecedents of character and documents submitted by the petitioner 
and other applicants. The smooth sailing of the petitioner came 

2 
     W.P. No.50582/2022 
 
 
across a hurdle when the petitioner approached for medical fitness 
test. He was apprised that he is not entitled and qualified for the 
said recruitment process as he, subsequent to the last date of 
submission of recruitment form i.e., 03.01.2021, was found 
involved in criminal case bearing FIR No.424/2021 dated 
29.09.2021, in respect of offences under Section 431 of the Pakistan 
Penal Code, 1860 (“the PPC”), read with Section 16 of the West 
Pakistan Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, 1960. 
2. 
 
Feeling aggrieved, the petitioner approached this Court 
by filing present constitutional petition under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (“the 
Constitution”) on the ground that the rejection of the candidature 
of the petitioner is unlawful and against the fundamental rights of 
the petitioner to join a lawful profession, in accordance with law, 
inasmuch as the petitioner was acquitted from the charges in the 
above referred case by the Court of learned Judicial Magistrate 
(Section-30), Wazirabad, vide order dated 18.06.2022. In report and 
para-wise comments filed on behalf of City Police Officer, 
Gujranwala (respondent No.2), factual matrix of the case has been 
admitted, however, it has been pleaded that on the basis of Standing 
Order No.6/2015 issued, vide letter No.AD/E-III/801/XI dated 
29.07.2022, the petitioner’s application was rejected as the 
petitioner was found guilty during the investigation carried out by 
the Police.  
3. 
 
M/s. Muhammad Jawad Zafar and Muhammad Talha 
Mushtaq, Advocates on behalf of the petitioner submit that when 
the petitioner applied for the post of Constable in the month of 
January, 2021, no case was registered against him and registration 
of the criminal case is subsequent event in which the Court of 
competent jurisdiction has acquitted the petitioner from the charges 
levelled therein.

     W.P. No.50582/2022 
 
 
4. 
 
Conversely, Ms. Samia Khalid, Additional Advocate 
General along with Mr. Imran Khan, Assistant Advocate General 
on instructions and while relying upon the strength of report and 
para-wise comments, submit that the police department is a 
disciplined force obligated with the duty to maintain public order 
and security and the police personnel are often obligated with 
discharging sensitive duties. Therefore, recruitment of anyone who 
has been involved in a criminal activity reflected by registration of 
FIR may entail risk in the discharge of those duties as well as create 
difficulties in maintenance of discipline within the force, hence, the 
respondents were justified in denying the appointment to the 
petitioner. Add that the police department has a uniform policy and 
if the candidate in any manner is involved in any criminal case by 
way of registration of FIR or conviction thereunder, such candidate 
is debarred from seeking employment on the strength of Standing 
Order No.6/2015, which is being adhered to across the Punjab, 
without any discrimination.  
5. 
 
In rebuttal, learned counsel for the petitioner submits 
that the police department is in habit of making pick and choose 
whenever the recruitment process is initiated. In this regard, case of 
one Shahnawaz Hussain s/o Muhammad Ishaq was referred, who 
was appointed as Constable, vide office order No.6152/SRC, dated 
13.09.2022, despite the fact that he was accused in case FIR 
No.1/2021 registered with Police Station Tatlay Aaly, District 
Gujranwala.  
6. 
 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
7. 
 
The core legal issue that requires determination and 
opinion of this Court is to examine whether a candidate seeking 
employment with the police department can be debarred from being 
appointed merely on the ground that criminal case was registered 
against the said candidate after submission of his application, more 

4 
     W.P. No.50582/2022 
 
 
particularly, when the applicant was acquitted by the Court of 
competent jurisdiction?  
8. 
 
Before answering the above referred legal question, it 
will be in fitness of things to reproduce relevant part of the 
Standing Order No.6/2015 that reads as under: 
“III) All those candidates who during character 
verification have been found involved in 
criminal cases (either under trial or acquitted 
on multiple grounds) shall not be appointed in 
Police Department as constable, in the light of 
instructions issued vide this Office Order No.SE-
IV/7317-70/II, dated 26.06.2014. 
IV) 
All the candidates submit an affidavit for 
non-involvement in criminal cases at the time of 
submission of application form and if the case is 
registered against an applicant after the last date 
of submission of application form, but the 
applicant is not challaned & declared 
innocent; then that would not be ground for 
rejection of an applicant. However, DPO must 
examine that case is not cancelled or accused 
declared innocent due to compromise between 
parties in the light of para 23 of Standing Order 
No.06/2015 amended vide No.SE-III/1105-
60/XV dated 01.06.2018.”  
 
 
 
 
    (Emphasis supplied) 
 
9. 
 
It has become stone-etched principle of law that mere 
registration of FIR does not render a person guilty of commission of 
a crime, under the law. Registration of FIR is merely a step to put 
the investigative machinery of the state into motion to collect the 
evidence, which may culminate into the acquittal or conviction of 
the accused by the competent Court of law, exercising judicial 
power of the state. While at the one end of the spectrum lies the 
fundamental rights of the petitioner to pursue a profession and/or 
business of his choice and to be dealt with in accordance with law, 
as envisaged under Article 4 of the Constitution, the need to 
maintain the police department as a disciplined force tasked with 
the obligation to maintain law and order in the society lies at the 

5 
     W.P. No.50582/2022 
 
 
other end. Hence, any aspirant to join police force must not have 
criminal antecedents as the same may result in recruiting of such 
personnel who may create difficulties in maintaining the force as 
disciplined one.  
10.  
Perusal of the record reveals that there is no denial on 
part of the police department that one Shahnawaz Hussain was 
appointed as Constable despite the fact that a criminal case was 
registered against him, hence, it is crystal clear that the police 
department has not been consistent and uniform in its application 
and construction/interpretation of the Standing Order No.6/2015 as 
evident from the recruitment of the above referred Shahnawaz 
Hussain, considering his acquittal in the criminal case. It is also 
imperative to note that this Court directed the respondents to submit 
a list on behalf of the Inspector General of Police, Punjab to 
establish that no discrimination has been done while appointing any 
individual against whom a case was registered after submission of 
his application and later on such candidate was acquitted to 
substantiate stance that a uniform policy has been adopted. Needful 
was done and a list was provided to this Court on 01.06.2023, 
which depicts that one Talha Ijaz applied for recruitment as 
Constable during the year 2020-21 and though FIR No.2051 of 
2020 under Section 148/149 of PPC was found registered against 
him after submission of application but he was appointed as 
Constable. Moreover, apart from the case of Talha Ijaz and 
Shahnawaz Hussain, the said list also depicts that there have been 
as many as 15-candidates, who were appointed as Constables/Lady 
Constable although criminal cases had been registered against them 
after submission of their respective application forms and they were 
later on acquitted. When confronted with the cases of above-
referred Shahnawaz Hussain and few others, it was vehemently 
asserted on behalf of the respondents that in all those cases, the 
applicants concerned were extended appointments as they were 

6 
     W.P. No.50582/2022 
 
 
declared innocent during the investigation and later on acquitted by 
the competent Court whereas in the instant case the petitioner has 
been found guilty during the investigation and only acquitted by the 
Court. The findings during the investigation have prevailed with the 
respondent department while rejecting the petitioner’s candidature.  
11.  
This Court is of the opinion that the argument of the 
police department cannot be countenanced as the object and 
purpose of the investigation by the police is the collection of 
evidence that cannot conclusively determine the guilt or innocence 
of the accused. This takes me to the nub of the matter that is to 
determine whether acquittal in any case and in all situations makes 
the antecedents for the purposes of recruitment untainted obligating 
the respondent department to recruit a candidate if he qualifies 
otherwise. Acquittal in a criminal case connotes that it has been 
found that a person (for the purpose of recruitment means any 
applicant like the petitioner) has been accused of the offence 
maliciously and falsely, and that after his acquittal no blemish 
whatsoever is attached to him. This Court is of the opinion that 
acquittal should be on the merits and not on account of any 
compromise/compounding of the offence. This interpretation gets 
credence from para (IV) of the Standing Order No.6/2015 as the 
same clearly contemplates that if the case is registered against an 
applicant after the last date of submission of application form, but 
the applicant is not challaned & declared innocent; then that 
would not be a ground for rejection of an applicant and the DPO 
must examine that case is not cancelled or accused                   
declared innocent due to compromise between parties. Meaning         
thereby that it is only when the declaration of innocence           
and/or the acquittal is not on merit but for some other             
reasons 
such 
as 
compromise 
that 
the 
department 
can                 
reject the candidature of the applicant. In the instant case, while the 
petitioner was found involved in the commission of the offence 

7 
     W.P. No.50582/2022 
 
 
during the investigation, the learned Magistrate, vide order dated 
18.06.2022 held as under:  
“3. 
As per crime report, the allegation 
against the accused perons is that on 
28.09.2021, they gathered at “Allahwala 
Chowk” while carrying black and red flags, 
who had also blocked the road. Except this no 
other allegation whatsoever was leveled against 
them. The record transpires that, as per crime 
report, the complainant/TASI witnessed the 
occurrence with his own eyes yet, got registered 
the case at police station on next day, without 
explaining the said delay. The question, 
therefore, arises that had he or other police 
officials present at the spot then why law of the 
state was put into motion after due deliberation 
and consultation of one day. Besides, the 
complainant did not disclose the wording of 
alleged chanted slogan in the crime report nor 
stated about the time of alleged blockage of 
public road by the accused persons. Even the 
I.O did not join in investigation any private 
person who may had complained regarding the 
said blockage. Presence of any witness is also 
not shown by him in the site map plan. Besides 
above all, nothing has been attached and even 
alleged by the complainant that permission for 
initiation of proceedings u/s: 16 of MPO, 1961 
(sic) was ever sought or extended by competent 
authority. Needless to mention here that 
necessary ingredients for attraction of said 
penal provision is also missing in the crime 
report. All the above, therefore, make the 
instant case as full of doubts and dents, 
whereby no probability of conviction exists in 
view of the attending circumstances of the case. 
Further proceedings, therefore, would be a futile 
exercise and an abuse process of law and court as 
well. Resultantly, all the accused persons of 
crime report are hereby acquitted while invoking 
provisions u/s: 249-A Cr.P.C.” 
                                                (Emphasis provided) 
Above quoted part of the order of the learned Magistrate clearly 
depicts that the petitioner was acquitted on merits and not on the 

8 
     W.P. No.50582/2022 
 
 
basis of any compromise. The police department is interpreting the 
Standing Order No.6/2015 in general and the opinion of the 
Investigating Officer in particular in a manner as if the opinion of 
the Investigating Officer carries precedence over the judicial 
scrutiny of the matter, which certainly is misconceived.  
12.  
Moreover, the police department seems to have fallen in 
grave error in according sanctity to the finding of innocence in the 
investigation in case of Shahnawaz and others and not to the 
petitioner in instant case where the petitioner has been acquitted by 
the Court on the ground that the necessary material for constitution 
of the alleged offence is not made out from the facts of the case. 
Judicial finding as to non-constitution of the offence vis-à-vis 
finding of the investigation as to innocence of an offence must 
command more reverence, respect and legal authority on two 
counts. Firstly, it is settled law, as observed above, that the purpose 
of investigation is to collect evidence and any finding/determination 
of guilt/innocence by the investigation agency is neither binding on 
the Court nor carries any legal backing. Secondly, the petitioner in 
the instant case has been acquitted not on the basis of some 
compromise rather the offence alleged against him from the very 
facts of the case was held to be not made out before the Court of 
competent jurisdiction. Learned Law Officers could not refute that 
judicial verdict in favour of the petitioner, on merits, cannot be 
considered as subservient to the police opinion recorded against the 
petitioner. However, Muhammad Saleem Chughtai, AIG, Punjab 
Police, who is in attendance today, states that the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in C.P. No.4709/2019, titled “Zeeshan Ahmad v. Govt. of 
Punjab through Inspector General of Police, Punjab, Lahore and 
others”, vide order dated 01.11.2022 held that even if the petitioner 
is acquitted from the charges, the said findings are not binding on 
the police department. The contention of Muhammad Saleem 
Chughtai, AIG, Punjab Police is misconceived inasmuch as the 

9 
     W.P. No.50582/2022 
 
 
facts of case of Zeeshan Ahmad supra, are totally distinguishable 
from the facts and circumstances of the present case. In Zeeshan 
Ahmad supra, the criminal case was registered against the 
applicant/petitioner therein who failed to disclose the same in his 
application and pleaded before this Court, at Multan Bench, that 
non-disclosure of registration of a criminal case was immaterial 
since the applicant therein was subsequently acquitted but this 
Court in the said case as also the Supreme Court of Pakistan held 
that mere non-disclosure is fatal and amounts to concealment of 
facts and hence, such a candidate is not fit person to be offered an 
appointment in the police department. On the contrary, in the 
instant case, there was no criminal case registered against the 
petitioner at the time when he applied for the appointment as 
Constable and hence, there was no suppression of facts and 
therefore, the reliance placed on case of Zeeshan Ahmad supra, is 
misconceived.  
13.  
In view of the above discussion, this petition has merits 
and is accordingly allowed. The respondents are directed to 
proceed further in the matter for appointment of the petitioner, in 
accordance with law.
