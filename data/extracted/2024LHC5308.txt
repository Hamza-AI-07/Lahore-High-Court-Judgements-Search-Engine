For the petitioner 
Mr. Zakriya Moon Gill, Advocate 
For the Province of 
Punjab 
Mr. Kanwar Sajid Ali, Assistant Advocate 
General  
 
 
Raheel Kamran J:- The petitioner has 
invoked the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court to challenge the 
notification dated 06.12.2023 issued by the Secretary Local 
Government & Community Development Department, South Punjab 
whereby he has been transferred from the post of Sub Engineer, 
Municipal Committee, Vehari and posted as Sub-Engineer, District 
Council, Vehari.   
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that earlier on 
the basis of similar grievance a Writ Petition No.19036 of 2023 was 
filed by another Officer of the Local Government, which was 
allowed by this Court vide judgment dated 17.05.2024 and 
notification of his transfer impugned therein was set aside.  He 
further contends that the petitioner’s case is also on the same footing, 
therefore, it may be decided in terms of the aforementioned petition.

W.P.No.19728 of 2023 
3. 
Learned Law Officer, while opposing this petition, contends 
that case of the petitioner is on different footing from the 
aforementioned petition already allowed by this Court, as petitioner 
in the said petition was Chief Officer whose tenure was secured 
under section 186 of the Punjab Local Government Act, 2022 (‘Act’) 
whereas the petitioner here is Sub-Engineer.   
4. 
Heard.  Record perused. 
5. 
In order to have a better understanding, this Court deems it 
appropriate to reproduce the findings given in the aforementioned 
W.P.No.19036 of 2023, which are as under:-  
 
“5. Although a government servant has no vested right to remain 
posted at a place of his choice and he cannot insist that he must 
be transferred at any particular place yet if the transfer order is 
made in violation of any statutory provision, the Court can 
interfere with it.  Admittedly, the petitioner was transferred at the 
present place of posting vide notification dated 16.09.2022 and he 
has been further transferred from the said place vide impugned 
notification after about one year and two months.  However, 
section 186 of the Act provides security of tenure to the Chief 
Officers and such other Officers of the local governments.  The 
same is reproduced hereunder: - 
“186. Security of tenure for the Chief Officer and other 
officers.-  All Chief Officers and such other officers of the local 
governments that may be specified by the Secretary from time 
to time, shall ordinarily hold office for a period of not less than 
two years.” 
 
After perusing the above provision of law, this Court has no 
hesitation in holding that ordinarily when a certain period of 
tenure has been provided to the officers by the legislature, it is the 
responsibility of the competent authority to abide by the same so 
that the benefit may be given to all such persons who are covered 
under the said law. Its execution cannot be left at the whims and 
wishes of the competent authority to grant this benefit or 
advantage on pick and choose basis.  However, use of the word 
“ordinarily” in section 186 ibid saves power of the competent 
authority to deprive an incumbent of his security of tenure from 
holding office in extraordinary circumstances, for which purpose 
the order passed by the competent authority should manifest valid 
reasons.  I have also gone through the impugned notification of 
transfer wherein no reason including any exigency or public 
interest is mentioned.  
6. Although clause (c) of notification dated 15.08.2023 issued by 
the Election Commission of Pakistan only mentions the Federal 
and Provincial Governments and not the Local Government yet 
the impugned transfer notification has been issued by the 

3 
W.P.No.19728 of 2023 
Secretary Local Government & Community Development 
Department, Government of the Punjab (South Punjab), therefore, 
contention of the petitioner’s counsel that restriction imposed 
upon posting and transfer is not applicable to the officer of Local 
Governments, is misconceived.   
7. Insofar as provision of section 205(1) of the Act declaring 
that all offices, agencies and authorities of the defunct local 
governments shall continue providing public services without any 
interruption till such time new local governments are established,  
referred by the learned Law Officer is concerned, sub-section (2) 
thereof provides that all officers and servants of the defunct local 
governments shall continue to discharge their respective duties 
and exercise their powers with the successor local governments 
under this Act, therefore, contention of the learned Law Officer is 
misconceived. 
8. Since the petitioner is not claiming any vested right against 
any particular post but only wants implementation of security of 
tenure provided under section 186 of the Act and there is also a 
ban imposed by the Election Commission of Pakistan vide 
notification dated 15.08.2023, the impugned notification for 
transfer of the petitioner calls for interference by this Court.  
Accordingly, this petition is allowed and impugned notification 
for transfer of the petitioner dated 06.12.2023 and the subsequent 
notification dated 06.12.2023 are set aside.  However, nothing in 
this order shall be taken to restrict or prevent the competent 
authority to transfer the petitioner after expiry of the requisite 
tenure or where extraordinary circumstances so warranted, in 
accordance with law.” 
 
6. 
The only difference emphasized by the learned Law Officer 
between this case and the aforementioned petition is that status of 
the petitioner is not equal to that of the Chief Officer.  I am afraid the 
stance taken by the learned Law Officer is misconceived, as section 
186 of the Act, quoted above, refers to all Chief Officers and such 
other officers of the Local Governments that may be specified by the 
Secretary from time to time.  The petitioner was transferred and 
posted as Sub-Engineer, District Council, Vehari vide notification 
dated 06.12.2023 by the Secretary Local Government and 
Community Development Department, therefore, petitioner falls 
within the category of ‘such other officers’ specified by the 
Secretary. 
7. 
 The documents annexed with this petition reflect that since 
05.10.2022, within a span of fourteen months, the petitioner has been 

4 
W.P.No.19728 of 2023 
transferred five times and transfer through the impugned notification 
has been made just after four months, which is against the ordinary 
tenure provided in section 186 of the Act.   
8. 
The normal period of posting at a station provided by the 
law is to be followed in ordinary circumstances unless for reasons of 
exigencies of service1.  The transfers of civil servants should only be 
considered on the basis of convenience to the general public, 
betterment of the institution or in the interest of public good but 
unfortunately, this is being used for extraneous considerations.  At 
times the officials are frequently transferred on the whims and 
caprices of politicians and others on the consideration of vested 
interests.  However, they should ordinarily be allowed to hold the 
office as per their tenure provided in the law/policy to encourage 
operational freedom within the confines of rules and laws as the 
same would effectively deter outside influences from using transfers 
as a threatening weapon and will promote professionalism, 
efficiency and good governance.  When the ordinary tenure for a 
posting is specified in the law or rules made thereunder, such tenure 
must be respected and should not be varied, except for compelling 
reasons, which should be recorded in writing2.  However, on the 
touchstone of the above principles, the competent authority can 
transfer an officer on administrative grounds but if the same is 
tainted with mala fide or any external influence or any other 
arbitrary reason or a reason contrary to the settled principles of 
transfer/posting, the same is void abinitio.   Needless to observe that 
the right of an employee/officer against displacement or transfer is 
accepted only when the same is passed on extraneous consideration 
and it cannot be claimed as a matter of right. 
9. 
For what has been discussed above, this petition is allowed 
and impugned notification dated 06.12.2023 for transfer of the
