JUDGMENT 
Date of hearing 
24.05.2023 
Petitioner by 
Mr. Aziz ur Rehman Sheikh, Advocate 
Respondents by: 
Mr. Khalid Pervaiz Warraich, Deputy 
Attorney General and  
Mr. Hamid Rafique, Advocate/Legal 
Advisor of respondent NADRA. 
 
 
ABID AZIZ SHEIKH, J. Through this constitutional 
petition, the petitioner has challenged the order of removal 
from service dated 27.10.2016 passed by respondent No.5 and 
order dated 18.04.2017 passed by respondent No.3 dismissing 
the departmental appeal of the petitioner.  
2. 
Relevant facts are that petitioner was employee of 
National Database Registration Authority (NADRA). He was 
charge sheeted on 18.03.2016 for misconduct and after inquiry 
and show cause notice, he was removed from service through 
impugned order dated 27.10.2016. The departmental appeal of 
the petitioner was also dismissed on 18.04.2017, hence this 
constitutional petition.  
3. 
Learned counsel for the respondents at the very outset 
raised preliminary objection that service regulations of 

 
 
W.P. No.26318/2017 
-2- 
 
 
 
NADRA being non-statutory, this constitutional petition is not 
maintainable. He further submits that service laws applicable 
to civil servants were adopted under the non-statutory service 
regulations, therefore, the same also have the status of non-
statutory regulations.  
4. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner on the other hand 
submits that petitioner was removed from service on the basis 
of allegation, which does not amount to misconduct but at best 
amount to negligence or inefficiency. On the question of 
maintainability, he submits that as petitioner was charge 
sheeted and removed under the Government Servants 
(Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 1973 (Rules of 1973), 
therefore, due to statutory intervention, this constitutional 
petition is maintainable.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. Before touching 
merits of the case, I would like to decide the question of 
maintainability of this constitutional petition. The NADRA has 
been established under the National Database and Regulatory 
Authority Ordinance, 2000 (Ordinance). Under section 44 of 
the Ordinance, the Federal Government may by notification in 
official gazette make rules for carrying out the purpose of this 
Ordinance, whereas under section 45 of the Ordinance, the 
authority may by notification in the official gazette make 
regulations not inconsistent with the provisions of this 
Ordinance or rules. Under section 45(2) of the Ordinance, the 

 
 
W.P. No.26318/2017 
-3- 
 
 
 
regulations may also provide for appointment of Registration 
Officers, Members of staff, Experts, Consultants, Advisors, 
other Officers and employees, and terms and conditions of 
their service. In pursuance to section 45 of the Ordinance, the 
authority framed regulations termed as “The National 
Database and Registration Authority (Application for National 
Identity Card) Regulations, 2002” (Regulations). Under 
regulation 23 of the Regulations, the laws which are applicable 
to civil servants including Rules of 1973 were adopted by 
NADRA for applying the same to employees of NADRA. 
Regulation 23 for ready reference are reproduced hereunder:- 
“23. Efficiency & Discipline Rules. Subject to the 
provisions of regulation 24, Rules made and 
instructions issued by the Government of Pakistan or 
a prescribed authority as for civil servants under 
Section 15 and 16 of the Civil Servants Act, 1973 as 
amended from time to time will be applicable insofar 
as practicable to the employees of the Authority.  
  
Provided that the Government Servants 
(Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 1973 shall not be 
applicable to the extent the same relate to efficiency 
or otherwise of an employee including Clause (a) of 
Rule 3 thereof and any efficiency related action shall 
be governed by the provisions of Part-II of Chapter-4 
of these Regulations”. 
  
6. 
The honourable Supreme Court in “Maj. (Retd.) Syed 
Muhammad Tanveer Abbas vs. Federation of Pakistan through 
Secretary Ministry of Interior and others” (2019 SCMR 984) 
already held that the Regulations of NADRA under section 45 
of the Ordinance are non-statutory. In said case, constitutional 
petitions were filed before learned Sindh High Court by 

 
 
W.P. No.26318/2017 
-4- 
 
 
 
various employees of NADRA against their orders of 
termination. The Division Bench of learned Sindh High Court 
dismissed the Constitutional Petitions on the ground that 
Regulations are framed by the Authority under Section 45 of 
the Ordinance, hence, they are non-statutory. The said 
judgment was challenged before the Hon‟ble Supreme Court 
of Pakistan, where the appeals were dismissed and the August 
Supreme Court of Pakistan held that Regulations of NADRA 
are non-statutory in nature. Relevant observations of the 
Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan are reproduced 
hereunder:- 
“When the DHA case is compared with the 
appellants' case, there are certain obvious 
similarities, the first and most important being 
of course that both involved situations of 
termination from service. Apart from that, in our 
view, as held by this Court in relation to DHA, 
there can hardly be any doubt that NADRA is 
also a "person" within the meaning of Article 
199(1)(a)(ii) read with clause (5) thereof. 
Equally, it is also clear that the 2002 
Regulations, like the DHA service rules of 2008, 
were non-statutory in nature. It also cannot be 
in doubt that the termination clauses involved in 
the present appeals are in all material respects 
the same as Rule 8(b)(1) of the DHA service 
rules. This is apparent on a bare reading of the 
said provisions. The crucial question therefore 
is whether the termination clauses involved here 
can be treated in the same manner as Rule 
8(b)(1), and the same or similar relief accorded 
the present appellants?”  
  
(Emphasis supplied.) 

 
 
W.P. No.26318/2017 
-5- 
 
 
 
The same view was also followed by this Court in judgment 
dated 22.03.2022 in W.P. No.113414/2017 titled “Amir 
Shehzad etc. vs. Federation of Pakistan etc.” as under:- 
“From plain reading of Section 44 of the 
Ordinance, 
it 
is 
manifest 
that 
Federal 
Government may make Rules for carrying out 
the purpose of Ordinance, whereas the Authority 
may make Regulations for carrying out the 
functions 
of 
the 
Ordinance 
including 
appointments and terms and conditions of 
services of the staff of the NADRA. The 
Authority is defined under Section 2 (b) of the 
Ordinance, means National Database and 
Registration Authority established under Section 
3 of the Ordinance. It is also admitted position 
that in pursuance to Section 44 of the 
Ordinance, Federal Government framed Rules 
termed as “The National Database and 
Registration Authority (National Identity Card) 
Rules, 2002” (Rules), whereas in pursuance to 
section 45 of the Ordinance, the Authority 
framed regulations termed as “The National 
Database 
and 
Registration 
Authority 
(Application 
for National 
Identity 
Card), 
Regulations, 2002” (Regulations). On face of it, 
Rules being framed by the Federal Government 
under Section 44 of the Ordinance have the 
statutory force, however, Regulations being 
framed under Section 45 of the Ordinance by the 
Authority, without any approval of the Federal 
Government, does not have any statutory status. 
The terms and conditions of service of 
employees of NADRA including their promotion 
policy vide Notification dated 22.01.2004, are 
also framed by the Authority under Section 45 of 
the Ordinance (and not by Federal Government 
under Section 44 of the Ordinance), therefore, 
the same are also non-statutory.”  
 
7. 
In view of above discussion, there is no doubt that the 
Regulations framed by NADRA under section 45 of the 
Ordinance are non-statutory, however, the first legal question 

 
 
W.P. No.26318/2017 
-6- 
 
 
 
require determination in this case is that whether impugned 
orders passed under Rules of 1973 would amount to statutory 
intervention or Rules of 1973 being adopted by NADRA, 
under regulation 23 of the Regulations, will have the status of 
non-statutory Regulations for the purpose of maintainability of 
this constitutional petition. The honourable Supreme Court in 
“M.H. Mirza vs. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, 
Cabinet Division, Government of Pakistan, Islamabad and 2 
others” (1994 SCMR 1024) held that mere adoption of 
statutory rules of the Government or their application by 
reference will not automatically lend a statutory cover or 
content to those rules. Relevant observations of honourable 
apex Court are as under:- 
“Sections 37, 38, 50 and 51 of the CDA 
Ordinance, 1960 (Ordinance XXIII of 1960) are 
relevant. An examination of these provisions 
shows that the CDA was itself to determine the 
terms and conditions of its employees and that 
the Government had nothing to say in the 
matter. None of its Regulations whether framed 
by it itself or adopted by reference had a 
statutory basis in law. This view is supported by 
the view taken in Ch. Abdul Rashid v. Capital 
Development Authority, Islamabad and other 
(PLD 1979 Lahore 803) and the Principal, 
Cadet 
College, 
Kohat 
and 
another 
v. 
Muhammad Shoaib Qureshi (PLD 1984 SC 
170). The adoption of the rules of the 
Government or their application by reference 
will not lend a statutory cover or content to 
these rules, as held in Lahore Central 
CoOperative Bank Limited v. Saif Ullah Shah 
(PLD 1959 SC (Pak) 210 and finally very 
recently in Chairman, Pakistan Council of 
Scientific and Industrial Research, Islamabad 
and 3 others v. Dr. Mrs. Khalida Razi (Civil 

 
 
W.P. No.26318/2017 
-7- 
 
 
 
Appeal No.270 of 1993. There being no 
statutory rules in the field, a Constitution 
petition was not at all competent on the 
subject.” 
 
The same view was also expressed by this Court in “Kamran 
Ahmad vs. Water and Power Development Authority through 
Chairman and 3 others (2014 PLC (C.S.) 332). Learned Sindh 
High Court in “Muhammad Mateen Khan vs. Federation of 
Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Interior Islamabad 
and 3 others” (2020 PLC (C.S.) 1), specifically dealt with the 
proposition in hand and held that by adoption under regulation 
23 to the  Rules of 1973 by NADRA, the same will not attain 
the status of statutory enactment/regulations but are basically 
instructions for the internal control or management of 
Respondent Authority and constitutional petition is not 
maintainable. On same ground, the learned Sindh High Court 
vide consolidated judgment dated 29.08.2019 dismissed 
number 
of 
constitutional 
petitions 
including 
C.P. 
No.6110/2015.  
8. 
Now the second moot question need deliberation is 
that when petitioner has been admittedly proceeded under 
statutory Rules of 1973, then why same does not amount to 
statutory intervention and writ is not maintainable in view of 
law settled in “Pakistan Defence Officers‟ Housing Authority 
and others vs. Lt. Col. Syed Jawaid Ahmed” (2013 SCMR 
1707). The august Supreme Court in aforenoted judgment held 

 
 
W.P. No.26318/2017 
-8- 
 
 
 
that even person who was governed under non-statutory 
Rules/Regulations but if he was proceeded under any statute, 
then writ petition be maintainable. The relevant observations 
by honourable Supreme Court are as follows:- 
“It was not disputed before this Court by 
appellants learned counsel that the respondent-
employees 
were 
“persons 
in 
corporation 
service” within the meaning of section 2(c) of the 
Ordinance 2000 and except in the case of N.E.D. 
University, they were proceeded against under 
the said law. This was a „statutory intervention 
and the employees had to be dealt with under the 
said law. Their disciplinary matters were being 
regulated by something higher than statutory 
rules i.e. the law i.e. Ordinance, 2000. Their 
right of appeal (under section 10) had been held 
to be ultra vires of the Constitution by this Court 
as they did not fall within the ambit of the Civil 
Servants Act, 1973, [(in Mubeen us Salam‟s case 
(PLD 2006 SC 602) and Muhammad Imrees‟s 
case (PLD 2007 SC 681)]. They could in these 
circumstances invoke constitutional jurisdiction 
under Article 199 of the Constitution to seek 
enforcement of their right guaranteed under 
Article 4 of the Constitution which inter alia 
mandates that every citizen shall be dealt with in 
accordance with law.”   
 
9. 
The august Supreme Court in Pakistan Defence 
Housing Authority case supra held that because under section 
2(c) of Removal from Service (Special Powers) Ordinance, 
2000 (Ordinance 2000), same was applicable to employees of 
„Corporation‟ and persons who were proceeded against under 
Ordinance 2000 (except employees of N.E.D. University who 
were not proceeded under Ordinance 2000) were employees of 
Corporation, hence there was statutory intervention. However 

 
 
W.P. No.26318/2017 
-9- 
 
 
 
in the present case, the petitioner was proceeded under Rules 
of 1973. The perusal of provisions of Rules of 1973 shows that 
under Rule 1(2) thereof, same are only applicable to civil 
servants and not to employees of Authority who are not civil 
servants. The petitioner being employee of NADRA is not a 
civil servant but an employee of an authority, therefore, Rules 
of 1973 on its own are not applicable to petitioner and have 
been made applicable only by way of adoption and reference 
under Regulation 23 of the non-statutory regulations.  The 
legal position would have been totally different and 
constitutional petition would be maintainable due to statutory 
intervention, if Rules of 1973 were applicable to NADRA 
employees by virtue of provisions of the Rules of 1973 itself 
without same being adopted under Regulation 23 of the 
Regulations. In such eventuality, merely because Rules of 
1973 were also adopted under Regulation 23 by NADRA 
besides being otherwise applicable to its employees, the same 
would amount to statutory intervention and writ petition be 
maintainable in view of law settled by august Supreme Court 
in Pakistan Defence Officers Housing Authority supra. The 
Rules of 1973 being only applicable to civil servants and have 
been applied to employees of Authority i.e. NADRA only by 
virtue of adoption under Regulation 23 of the non-statutory 
Regulations, therefore, for all intent and purpose, the Rules of 

 
 
W.P. No.26318/2017 
-10- 
 
 
 
1973 cannot have superior status to non-statutory Regulations 
under which they were adopted.  
 
10. 
The above discussion- leads to ineluctable conclusion 
that Regulations of NADRA are non-statutory and even 
though petitioner was proceeded under statutory Rules of 1973 
but same being adopted under regulation 23 of the 
Regulations, the same will have status of non-statutory rules, 
hence this constitutional petition is not maintainable. 
11. 
In view of above discussion, this petition is 
dismissed being non-maintainable.
