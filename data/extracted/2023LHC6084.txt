Defendants No. 11 to 15 By: Nemo 
 
ABID HUSSAIN CHATTHA, J: This suit is instituted by the Plaintiff-
Bank for recovery of Rs. 472,715,893.66/- with cost and cost of funds 
under Section 9 of the Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) 
Ordinance, 2001 (the “Ordinance”) against contesting Defendants No. 1 
to 10 and Proforma Defendants No. 11 to 15.  
2. 
The contents of the plaint reveal that Defendant No. 1 is a company 
incorporated under the company laws of Pakistan and upon its request was 
granted a Term Finance Facility (the “Facility”) by the Plaintiff-Bank 
against execution of finance and security documents. Defendant No. 2 as 
the Chief Executive Officer / Director and Defendants No. 3 to 9 as the 
Directors of Defendant No. 1 executed their personal guarantees for 
repayment of the Facility. Defendant No. 10 as an associated company of 
Defendant No. 1 also extended corporate guarantee regarding repayment of 
the Facility. Defendant No. 1 had set-up a sugar plant at Nankana Sahib 
and in order to shift the same to another location, it requested for grant of 
the Facility vide request letter dated 29.09.2015 which was accordingly, 
sanctioned to the tune of Rs. 600 million for a term of 05 years vide 
Facility Acceptance Letter dated 08.10.2015 on mark-up basis. The 

2 
 
 
 
 
C. O. S. No. 16637 / 2020 
 
 
requisite Agreement for Financing and ancillary finance and security 
documents were duly executed by Defendants No. 1 to 10. After availing 
the Facility, the same was defaulted and consequently, Defendant No. 1 
requested to restructure the defaulted amount vide letter dated 02.12.2016 
which culminated into Finance Restructuring Agreement dated 15.12.2016. 
Nevertheless, partial payment was made thereunder and the unpaid 
principal amount along with due mark-up was again requested to be 
restructured. In this respect, an Addendum dated 03.08.2018 was executed 
by Defendant No. 1, thereby, modifying the schedule of payment regarding 
the overdue balance restructured amount. However, Defendant No. 1 again 
defaulted and requested vide letter dated 27.02.2019 to further restructure 
the payable amount which led to the execution of last Finance 
Rescheduling Agreement dated 05.03.2019 accompanied with the 
execution of related finance and security documents. It is alleged that 
Defendant No. 1 once again defaulted pursuant thereto and consequently, 
Defendants No. 1 to 10 are, jointly and severally, liable to pay the suit 
amount, the details of which in compliance with the requirements of 
Section 9(3) of the Ordinance have been provided in paragraph No. 16 of 
the plaint. The alleged default is also admitted by Defendant No. 1 in its 
annual financial accounts for the years 2017 and 2018. Hence, this suit. 
3. 
Defendants No. 1 to 10 in their application for leave to defend the 
suit submitted that they were actually made to sign various documents in 
connection with a bill discounting facility to the cane growers against cane 
purchase receipts which were misused by the Plaintiff-Bank to create a 
fictitious Facility and as such, the entire transaction listed in the plaint is a 
sham and paper transaction. It was further stated, inter alia,  that the plaint 
is not supported by a certified copy of statement of accounts; the 
requirements of Section 9(3) of the Ordinance have not been complied with 
by the Plaintiff-Bank; Article 10-A of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 guarantees a right of fair trial through 
production of evidence; the mandatory necessary documents have not been 
appended with the plaint; the suit has not been competently instituted; the 
corporate guarantee of Defendant No. 10 is not valid and enforceable being 
beyond the scope of its Memorandum and Articles of Association; and the 

3 
 
 
 
 
C. O. S. No. 16637 / 2020 
 
 
suit is not maintainable having been instituted prematurely before the event 
of default. However, during the course of arguments, the aforesaid 
objections were not pressed except the last two issues which were termed 
as not only substantial but of the nature that cannot be resolved at the leave 
granting stage without recording of evidence. Accordingly, it was asserted 
that leave to defend the suit is liable to be granted. 
4. 
Section 10(3) of the Ordinance ordains that the application for leave 
to defend shall be in the form of written statement and shall contain a 
summary of substantial questions of law as well as fact in respect of which, 
in the opinion of the defendant, evidence needs to be recorded. Further, 
Section 10(6) of the Ordinance obligates the defendant to append all the 
documents with the application for leave to defend which, in the opinion of 
the defendant, support the substantial questions of law and fact. The 
plaintiff has been conferred the right of filing a reply to the application for 
leave to defend under Section 10(8) of the Ordinance. Importantly, vesting 
discretion upon the Banking Court, Section 10(9) unequivocally proclaims 
that the Banking Court shall grant the defendant leave to defend the suit, if 
on consideration of the contents of the plaint, the application for leave to 
defend and the reply thereto, it is of the view that substantial questions of 
law or fact have been raised in respect of which evidence needs to be 
recorded.  
5. 
 It follows from the above provisions of law that in the last resort, the 
Banking Court can grant leave to defend only if it considers that a 
substantial question of law or fact has been raised which cannot be 
determined without recording of evidence. No distinction is made in terms 
of nature of the issue which can either be a question of law or fact or a 
mixed question of law and fact. Rather, the only test prescribed in this 
behalf is the opinion of the Banking Court to determine as to whether the 
same can be resolved with or without recording of evidence which in turn 
becomes the barometer to grant or refuse leave to defend to the defendant. 
Hence, the applicable test is liable to be employed with respect to 
determination of each issue depending upon its nature and the material 
required to answer the same.

C. O. S. No. 16637 / 2020 
 
 
6. 
The first issue as to whether the corporate guarantee of Defendant 
No. 10 is valid or enforceable being beyond the scope of its Memorandum 
and Articles of Association can be conveniently settled by interpretation of 
the Memorandum and Articles of Association of Defendant No. 10 which 
are appended with the application for leave to defend and are not disputed 
by the Plaintiff-Bank. Defendant No. 10 is an associated company of 
Defendant No. 1. The original Facility Offer Letter dated 08.10.2015 as 
part of security arrangements required Defendant No. 1 to provide 
corporate guarantee of Defendant No. 10 with the specific covenant that no 
units / assets of Defendant No. 10 shall be sold without prior written 
approval of the Plaintiff-Bank coupled with a written undertaking of 
Defendant No. 10 to this effect before the draw-down of the Facility. 
However, in case of sale of any units / assets of Defendant No. 10, all the 
sale proceeds were required to be routed through the Plaintiff-Bank with 
which the Facility of the Plaintiff-Bank shall be adjusted in full alongwith 
payment of up-to-date mark-up. The Board of Directors of Defendant No. 
10 passed the resolution dated 21.09.2015 and approved the extending of 
corporate guarantee coupled with issuance of undertaking to enable 
Defendant No. 1 to secure the Facility. This was followed by execution of 
continuing corporate guarantee dated 08.10.2015 which constitutes a 
separate contract between Defendant No. 10 and the Plaintiff-Bank. In note 
7.1.6 of the financial accounts of Defendant No. 1 for the year ended on 
30.09.2017, the Facility of Rs. 390,000,000/- is acknowledged by 
Defendant No. 1 in terms of security of Pari Passu charge over all present 
and future fixed assets of Defendant No. 1 and corporate guarantee of 
Defendant No. 10 alongwith personal guarantees of Defendants No. 2 to 9 
at mark-up rate of 6 months KIBOR + 2% per annum payable in twelve 
quarterly installments. Similarly, the Facility in the same terms is also 
acknowledged in the note 8.1.6 of the financial accounts of the year ended 
on 30.09.2018. 
7. 
Defendant No. 1 or Defendant No. 10 from the date of grant of the 
Facility in 2015 till institution of this suit did not raise any objection with 
respect to the corporate guarantee extended by Defendant No. 10 for 
repayment of the Facility of Defendant No. 1. Clause (o) read with clause 

5 
 
 
 
 
C. O. S. No. 16637 / 2020 
 
 
(s) of the Memorandum of Association of Defendant No. 10 vests 
necessary borrowing and investment powers to the Board of Directors of 
Defendant No. 10 in its discretion. Clause (cc) thereof specifically 
empowers Defendant No. 10 to guarantee the performance of contracts and 
obligations in relation to the payment of any loan, debentures, stock, bonds 
and obligations or security issued by or in favour of the company and to 
guarantee the payment or return on such investment. Needless to state that 
execution of corporate guarantee by Defendant No. 10 in favour of 
Plaintiff-Bank was a separate contract and as such, Defendant No. 10 was 
obligated to honour and perform the same. 
8. 
The Memorandum of Association of a company is the document 
which forms and constitutes the company. It defines its purposes and 
objectives for which it is incorporated and determines the ambit of 
relationship of a company with the outside world. The Articles of 
Association of a company deal with the internal management of the 
company and determine inter se relationship between the management and 
shareholders of the company listing rules as to how it is run, governed and 
owned. The jurisprudence regarding the scope of activities that a company 
can possibly undertake in terms of its Memorandum of Association has 
universally evolved over the years. Consequently, the traditional concept of 
an objective or activity undertaken by a company being ultra vires the 
scope of its Memorandum of Association has been immensely diluted. It is 
now well acknowledged that stipulations in the Memorandum of 
Association of a company are required to be liberally and broadly 
interpreted unless a particular act by the company is unlawful or is 
specifically prohibited. For reference, see case titled, “Pakistan Mobile 
Communication Ltd. and others v. Appellate Bench No. III, Securities and 
Exchange Commission of Pakistan and others” (2016 CLD 76). 
Increasingly, various jurisdictions in the world are moving to the concept 
that just like a natural person who may perform any lawful act, a company 
as a juristic person may also undertake any lawful act. As such, the concept 
of controlling the company in terms of its activities through its 
Memorandum of Association is fast eroding. Canada has abolished the 
doctrine by way of Section 15(1) of the Canada Business Corporations Act, 

6 
 
 
 
 
C. O. S. No. 16637 / 2020 
 
 
1985 which states that a corporation has the capacity and privileges of a 
natural person. New Zealand has also extended farewell to the 
requirements of Memorandum of Association and an object clause by the 
introduction of Section 16 of the Companies Act, 1993 which is reproduced 
below:- 
“(1) Subject to this Act, any other enactment, and the general 
law, a company has, both within and outside New Zealand,- 
(a) full capacity to carry on or undertake any business 
or activity, do any act, or enter into any transaction; 
and  
(b) for the purposes of paragraph (a), full rights, 
powers, and privileges. 
(2) The constitution of a company may contain a provision 
relating to the capacity, rights, powers, or privileges of the 
company only if the provision restricts the capacity of the 
company or those rights, powers, and privileges.” 
 
9. 
In English law, having an object clause is not a mandatory 
requirement for a company. According to Section 31(1) of the Companies 
Act, 2006, unless a company’s Articles specifically restrict the objects of 
the company, its objects are unrestricted. The Sri Lanka Companies Act 
No. 7 of 2007 has also dispensed with, inter alia, the requirement of 
Memorandum of Association and object clause, thereby, granting the 
company the capacity to undertake any lawful business or activity or do 
any act or enter into any transaction and diversify away from its original 
business. Section 4 thereof, does away the requirement of a Memorandum 
and accordingly, the company needs only to submit Articles of Association 
at the time of incorporation and, thereby, dispenses with the ultra vires 
doctrine vis-à-vis the Memorandum of Association. However, although the 
law has removed the mandatory requirement of having an object clause, 
any company may specify its objects in its Articles if it wishes to do so. 
10. 
In view of above, it is explicitly clear that most of the countries have 
partially or completely done away with the doctrine of ultra vires with 
respect to objects listed in the Memorandum of Association in order to 
simplify the incorporation process, reduce the costs of incorporation and 
remove commercial constrains on business activities to be undertaken by a 

7 
 
 
 
 
C. O. S. No. 16637 / 2020 
 
 
company. The idea is to offer maximum flexibility in corporate 
transactions to a company which previously was restricted in terms of 
activities to be undertaken by a company. According protection to third 
parties regarding their transactions with a company is also at the heart of 
the evolving jurisprudence. Therefore, after partial or complete abolition of 
Memorandum of Association, modern companies now possess much more 
freedom, capacity and discretion to engage in diverse business activities.  
11. 
The modern trend of evolving jurisdiction on the subject is duly 
recognized in Pakistan through promulgation of the Companies Act, 2017 
(the “Act”). Section 18 of the Act stipulates that the effect of registration of 
the company in terms of its Memorandum and Articles of Association is 
that it is capable of exercising all the functions of an incorporated 
company, having perpetual succession and a common seal. Section 30 of 
the Act provides that notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or any 
other law for the time being in force or the Memorandum and Articles, the 
Memorandum and Articles of a company shall be deemed to include and 
always to have included the power to enter into any agreement for 
obtaining loans, advances, finances or credit, as defined in the Banking 
Companies Ordinance, 1962 and to issue other securities not based on 
interest for raising resources from a scheduled bank, a financial institution 
or general public. Section 26(1) of the Act states that a company may carry 
on or undertake any lawful business or activity and do any act or enter into 
any transaction being incidental and ancillary thereto which is necessary in 
attaining its business activities provided that the principal line of business 
of the company shall be mentioned in the Memorandum of Association of 
the company which shall always commensurate with name of the company. 
Further, Section 26(2) thereof proclaims that a company shall not engage in 
a business which is either prohibited or is restricted by any law, rules or 
regulations, unless necessary license, registration, permission or approval 
has been obtained or compliance with any other conditions has been made. 
Importantly, Section 27 of the Act prescribes the necessary ingredients of 
Memorandum of Association of a company limited by shares and as part of 
its objects, it only requires the company to state its principal line of 
business and allows it to carry on or engage in any business. The prescribed 

8 
 
 
 
 
C. O. S. No. 16637 / 2020 
 
 
form of Memorandum of Association of a company limited by shares in 
Table B of First Schedule to the Act requires to list a positive and a 
negative covenant with respect to the powers of the company which it may 
or may not do. The positive covenant in Clause 3(ii) thereof provides that 
except for the businesses mentioned in Clause 3(iii) thereof, the company 
shall engage in all the lawful businesses and shall be authorized to take all 
necessary steps and actions in connection therewith and ancillary thereto. 
The negative covenant in terms of Clause 3(iii) thereof imposes restrictions 
with respect to regulated businesses requiring licenses or approvals or 
prohibits businesses or acts which are either unlawful or forbidden or 
restricted. Therefore, the Act has effectively altered the traditional doctrine 
of ultra vires vis-à-vis the objects being beyond the scope of Memorandum 
of Association of a company. Hence, the observations in case titled, 
“Lucky Cement Ltd. v. Commissioner Income Tax, Zone Companies, 
Circle-5, Peshawar” (2015 SCMR 1494) are inapplicable after the 
enactment of the Act regarding the Memorandum of Association of a 
company. 
12. 
Therefore, it is safely concluded from the above analyses that 
Defendants No. 1 and 10 being associated companies in terms of Section 
2(4) of the Act and being in existence under the Act were fully competent 
to obtain and secure the Facility and as such, the objection to the effect that 
extending of corporate guarantee by Defendant No. 10 was beyond the 
scope of its Memorandum of Association is turned down.  
13. 
The second issue soliciting resolution is as to whether the suit has 
been instituted prematurely as on the date of its institution, Defendant No. 
1 had not defaulted in terms of the last Finance Rescheduling Agreement 
read with the Agreement for Financing on mark-up basis both dated 
05.03.2019. The said Finance Rescheduling Agreement relates to 
rescheduling of balance payment of the Facility consisting of principal 
amount of Rs. 390,000,000/- and mark-up of Rs. 35,792,917.81/- till 
21.02.2019 which was payable in terms of Annexures A & B (schedule of 
payments). It also stipulates that mark-up on the outstanding restructured 
Finance will be payable @ 1 year KIBOR + 2% per annum with the caveat 

9 
 
 
 
 
C. O. S. No. 16637 / 2020 
 
 
that mark-up accounting mythology in Annexure-B shall be valid for book-
keeping symbolizing tentative amounts and the actual amount of 
installments shall be determined at the agreed rate. It was further agreed in 
Clause 9 thereof, that in case of default in payment of any installment or 
part thereof, the restructured arrangement will be cancelled and the 
Plaintiff-Bank shall be entitled to recover the entire outstanding liabilities 
without any further reference to Defendant No. 1. Clause 14(9) thereof, 
inter alia, states that failure of Defendant No. 1 to pay any installment or 
part thereof of restructured Finance on due date shall constitute an event of 
default. The first installment of Rs. 39,000,000/- regarding the principal 
component of the restructured Finance as per Annexure-A was payable on 
21.08.2020, whereas, the suit was instituted on 18.03.2020 based upon the 
mistaken belief that tentative cumulating mark-up being carried forward 
from the date of restructured Finance listed in Annexure-A had become 
payable on 21.08.2019 but the same was not paid, thus constituting default 
before the date of institution of the suit. However, actually mark-up was 
payable under Annexure-B over a period of two years in eight quarterly 
installments starting from 21.05.2025 after settlement of the restructured 
Facility. Learned counsel for Defendants No. 1 to 10 when confronted as to 
whether any amount was paid against the restructured Facility after 
institution of the suit, candidly admitted that no payment was made as the 
Plaintiff-Bank had prematurely triggered the event of default and had 
initiated litigation. Hence, the suit was instituted prematurely by the 
Plaintiff-Bank before the event of default by Defendant No. 1 although the 
event of default had matured during the pendency of the suit. 
14. 
The proposition that emerges from the above eventuality is that what 
are the consequences and way forward when a suit for recovery under the 
Ordinance is instituted prematurely but matures during its pendency. In 
case titled, “Abdur Razaq v. Abdul Hamid” (1979 SCMR 534), a similar 
question was dilated upon by the Supreme Court of Pakistan with respect to 
ejectment application under the West Pakistan Urban Rent Restriction 
Ordinance, 1959 in terms of default of a tenant vis-à-vis his rights under 
the Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act, 1958 (the 
“Act of 1958”). It was found that the tenant was not in breach of any of his 

10 
 
 
 
 
C. O. S. No. 16637 / 2020 
 
 
obligations prescribed under the provisions of the Act of 1958, therefore, 
he could not be evicted until the expiry of statutory period of six years from 
the specified date. However, during pendency of the ejectment application, 
the said period of six years elapsed. Accordingly, it was held that no doubt 
the eviction application was filed before expiry of statutory period of six 
years but the said provision of law only prescribed that it would not be 
lawful to eject the tenant before the expiry of six years, however, there was 
no prohibition that a transferee of property could not file ejectment 
application against a tenant before the expiry of statutory period of six 
years. It was further held that if the ejectment application had been allowed 
before the period of statutory protection of six years accorded under the 
Act of 1958, the order of the Rent Controller would have been illegal but as 
the order was passed after the expiry of six years, it merely decided a right 
which had matured before the date of order on the ejectment application. 
Hence, although the eviction application was filed prematurely but to have 
dismissed it on this ground would amount to deprive the ejectment 
applicant of a right which became vested in him under the law. Conversely, 
if the ejectment application had been dismissed on the score of being 
premature on the date of its filing, the only result of such order would have 
been that the ejectment applicant would have to file a fresh application 
which would have been decreed in due course but after the proverbial 
delays of law. Therefore, it would amount to subject the ejectment 
applicant to unnecessary technicalities of law which would defeat the very 
object of the legislature in promulgating the law. Importantly, a passage by 
Mulla from his book on the Code of Civil Procedure (12th Edition) was 
cited at page 612 which being relevant is reproduced as under:- 
“Ordinarily, the decree in a suit should accord with the rights 
of the parties as they stand at the date of its institution. But 
where it is shown that the original relief claimed has, by 
reason of subsequent change of circumstances, become 
inappropriate, or that it is necessary to have the decision of 
the Court in the altered circumstances in order to shorten 
litigation or to do complete justice between the parties, it is 
incumbent upon the Court of justice to take notice of events 
which have happened since the institution of the suit and to 
mould its decree according to the circumstances as they stand 
at the time the decree is made.” 

11 
 
 
 
 
C. O. S. No. 16637 / 2020 
 
 
For reference also see cases titled, “Precision Engineering Ltd. and others 
v. The Grays Leasing Limited” (PLD 2000 Lahore 290); and “Managing 
Director, Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd. v. Syed Najmul Hassan 
Naqvi” (2005 SCMR 890). 
15. 
The Indian Supreme Court in case titled, “Vithalbhai (P) Ltd. v. 
Union Bank of India” [(2005) 4 Supreme Court Cases 315] has dealt with 
a similar question and opined that a suit of civil nature disclosing a cause of 
action even if instituted before the date on which the plaintiff became 
actually entitled to sue and claim the relief, if subsequently matures, is not 
to be necessarily dismissed for such reason. The question of suit being 
premature does not go to the root of jurisdiction of the Court and as such, 
the Court entertaining such a suit and passing decree therein is not acting 
without jurisdiction but it is in the judicial discretion of the Court to grant 
or refuse decree. The Court would examine whether any irreparable 
prejudice was caused to the defendant on account of the suit having been 
instituted a little before the date on which the plaintiff’s entitlement to 
relief became due and whether by granting the relief in such suit, a 
manifest injustice would be caused to the defendant. Taking into 
consideration, the explanation offered by the plaintiff for institution of suit 
before the date of maturity of cause of action, the Court may deny the 
plaintiff his costs or may make such other order adjusting equities and 
satisfying the ends of justice as it may deem fit in its discretion. The 
conduct of the parties and unmerited advantage to the plaintiff or 
disadvantage amounting to prejudice to the defendant, if any, would be 
relevant factors. However, certain riders are also stated in the said 
Judgment to the general rule to grant decree in judicial discretion upon 
maturity of a cause of action including when a mandatory bar is created by 
a statute which disables the plaintiff from instituting the suit on or before a 
particular date or the occurrence of a particular event or if such premature 
institution renders the presentation itself patently void and the invalidity is 
incurable such as when it goes to the root of the jurisdiction of the Court. 
16. 
The Ordinance is a special law which creates specialized Courts and 
prescribes a summary procedure for settlement of claims between a 

12 
 
 
 
 
C. O. S. No. 16637 / 2020 
 
 
‘customer’ and a ‘financial institution’. Section 9 of the Ordinance 
unequivocally provides that where a ‘customer’ or ‘financial institution’ 
commits a ‘default’ in fulfillment of any ‘obligation’ with regard to any 
‘finance’, the ‘financial institution’ or, as the case may be, the ‘customer’, 
may institute a suit in the Banking Court. There is no cavil to the 
proposition that a suit by a ‘financial institution’ or a ‘customer’ can thus 
be instituted by one against the other only in case of a ‘default’ in 
fulfillment of any ‘obligation’ with respect to any ‘finance’. However, the 
substance of the Ordinance is to determine the entitlement of a ‘financial 
institution’ or a ‘customer’ with respect to a right emanating with respect to 
‘default’ in fulfillment of any ‘obligation’ with regard to any ‘finance’. The 
alleged ‘default’ in the plaint agitated by the plaintiff is tentative based 
upon the opinion of the plaintiff which obviously is required to be 
determined and adjudicated by the Banking Court under the Ordinance. If 
the Banking Court discovers that the alleged default has in fact taken place, 
it may decree the suit or conversely, if it finds that the alleged default has 
not occurred, it will dismiss the suit. Hence, the right of a ‘customer’ or a 
‘financial institution’ to institute a suit is based on its assessment that a 
default has taken place but the same is liable to be determined by the 
Banking Court after adjudication as to whether it actually took place or 
otherwise. Thus, in case the Banking Court concludes that the ‘default’ 
alleged in the plaint was non-existent at the time of institution of the suit 
but it matured due of afflux of time during the pendency of the suit, the 
Banking Court in exercise of judicial discretion, can grant relief by 
decreeing the suit. In the instant case, as the default has already matured, 
therefore, dismissing the suit by granting the right to the Plaintiff-Bank to 
institute a fresh suit would serve no useful purpose and would amount to an 
exercise in futility to be undertaken again by the parties and the Banking 
Court. Accordingly, the contention of premature institution of the suit is 
answered on the score that the alleged default has matured during the 
pendency of the suit. However, in order to penalize the Plaintiff-Bank for 
having instituted a premature suit, a fine to the tune of Rs. 5,000,000/- is 
imposed upon the Plaintiff-Bank in favour of Defendant No. 1 in terms of 
Section 21 of the Ordinance in order to adjust equities between the parties. 

13 
 
 
 
 
C. O. S. No. 16637 / 2020 
 
 
The question having been so determined without the need for recording 
evidence, the application for leave to defend the suit instituted by 
Defendants No. 1 to 10 is rejected.  
17. 
The Proforma Defendants have been arrayed as parties to the suit as 
they have also extended various finance facilities to Defendant No. 1 
against various charges and securities. Defendants No. 11, 13 & 14 filed 
their separate applications for leave to defend highlighting their facilities 
and existing charges, whereas, Defendants No. 12 & 15 did not file any 
application for leave to defend. None of the Proforma Defendants contested 
the claim of the Plaintiff-Bank on merits. The claims of the Proforma 
Defendants based upon their separate facilities in terms of their 
corresponding securities and charges will be decided at the time of 
execution. The applications for leave to defend of Defendants No. 11, 13 & 
14 are disposed of, accordingly. 
18. 
From the above, it is manifestly evident that Defendant No. 1 availed 
the Facility from the Plaintiff-Bank which was restructured on a number of 
occasions on account of default by Defendant No. 1. Finally, Defendant 
No. 1 defaulted the Facility under the Finance Rescheduling Agreement 
dated 05.03.2019 which matured during the pendency of the suit. The 
plaint is supported by all necessary finance and security documents. It is 
also accompanied with the certified Statement of Accounts. As not a single 
instalment either with respect to principal or mark-up component was paid 
under the Finance Rescheduling Agreement dated 05.03.2019, therefore, 
the question to determine the amount due in terms of any payment made by 
Defendant No. 1 does not arise. The principal and mark-up components 
under the last Finance Restructuring Agreement dated 05.03.2019 are Rs. 
390,000,000/- and Rs. 35,792,917.81/-, respectively, the sum total of which 
amounts to Rs. 425,792,917.81/- as on 21.02.2019. Nothing was paid 
thereafter against the said amount. After deducting the amount of fine of 
Rs. 5,000,000/- imposed on the Plaintiff-Bank, this amount comes to Rs. 
420,792,917.81. The additional amount of claimed mark-up in the suit is 
denied. The date of default is declared as 22.02.2019 and cost of funds are 
allowed from the said date.
