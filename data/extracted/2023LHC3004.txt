Date of Hearing

Petitioner By: 
Ch. Hamid Mahmood, Advocate. 
Respondent No.1 
By: 
Rai Muhammad Umar Rafique, Advocate. 
 
Anwaar Hussain J: Briefly stated facts of the case are that 
respondent 
No.1/plaintiff/decree 
holder 
(“respondent/decree 
holder”) instituted a suit for recovery of the dowry articles or its 
alternate value against the petitioner/defendant/judgment debtor 
(“petitioner/judgment debtor”), which was decreed, vide judgment 
and decree dated 11.12.2021, passed by learned Family Judge and 
alternate value was adjudicated as Rs.350,000/- whereas when the 
appeal was preferred by the respondent/decree holder, the same was 
partially allowed without mentioning any amount as regards the 
alternate value of dowry articles in the decree sheet drawn by the 
learned Appellate Court below.  
2. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner/judgment debtor submits  
that when the execution petition was filed, the petitioner/judgment 
debtor filed objections that decree of learned Appellate Court below is 
uncertain, however, the same have been turned down by the learned 
Executing Court, vide order dated 15.11.2022, which finding has been 
upheld by the learned Appellate Court below, vide judgment dated 
08.02.2023 on the ground that any deficiency in the decree drawn by 
the learned Appellate Court below is merely a technicality, without 
appreciating that it is the decree which is to be executed and satisfied 
and not the judgment. Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent/

W.P No.14105/2023 
decree holder could not deny that the decree sheet drawn by the 
learned Appellate Court below does not reflect the exact amount of 
alternate value of dowry articles that has been awarded to the 
respondent/decree holder, however, states that the term „appeal 
partially allowed‟ reflected in the decree sheet needs to be interpreted 
keeping in view the judgment of learned Appellate Court below that 
clearly depicts that alternate value of dowry articles have been 
enhanced from Rs.350,000/- to Rs.500,000/-. 
3. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
4. 
The legal question that requires determination by this Court is 
to examine whether in the absence of any explicit amount mentioned 
in the decree sheet drawn by the learned Appellate Court below, in a 
family matter, can the learned Executing Court seek guidance from 
the judgment of the learned Appellate Court below, while executing 
the said decree.  
5. 
Admittedly, the respondent/decree holder was successful in her 
suit for recovery of dowry articles or its alternate value of 
Rs.2,740,500/-, which was decreed by the learned Trial Court and the 
respondent/decree holder was held entitled to recover Rs.350,000/- as 
alternate value of dowry articles, vide judgment and decree dated 
11.12.2021, against which the petitioner/judgment debtor admittedly 
has not preferred an appeal whereas on the appeal preferred by the 
respondent/decree holder, the learned Appellate Court below, partially 
accepted the appeal of the respondent/decree holder and decree sheet 
was drawn with the following remarks: 
 
“The appeal is partially Allowed. No order as to costs” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
6. 
There is no cavil to the proposition that the decree is the formal 
expression of adjudication rendered by the Court. Sub-rule (2) of Rule 
35 of Order XLI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (“the CPC”) 
contemplates that the decree shall contain the number of the appeal, 

 
 
 
3 
W.P No.14105/2023 
the names and descriptions of the appellant and respondent, and a 
clear specification of the relief granted or other adjudication made. No 
doubt that it is the decree and not the judgment that is to be executed 
and the learned Executing Court cannot go beyond decree. In the 
instant case, the decree drawn by the learned Appellate Court below 
does not reflect the exact amount awarded by the learned Appellate 
Court below while partially allowing the appeal preferred by the 
respondent/ decree holder.   
7. 
What is the effect of such uncertainty in the decree drawn in 
appeal and how to resolve the same is the nub of the matter. In this 
regard, at the outset, it is imperative to observe that Section 13 of the 
Family Courts Act, 1964 (“the Act”) clearly stipulates how the 
decrees passed by the Family Court are to be enforced whereas 
Section 17 of the Act clearly contemplates that the provisions of 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 and the CPC, except Sections 10 & 11 
thereof, shall not apply to the proceedings before any Family Court. 
Therefore, application of the petitioner was misconceived. In case 
titled “Amjad Iqbal v. Mst.Nida Sohail and others” (2015 SCMR 
128), the Supreme Court of Pakistan has held as under:  
“7. 
On the legal plane, it may be noted that section 17 
of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 (the Act) 
provides that the provisions of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 
1984 and the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 except 
sections 10 and 11 shall not apply to the proceedings 
before any Family Court. Thus the technical trappings of 
execution provided in the C.P.C. are excluded from 
application before the Family Court in execution of a 
decree for maintenance. Section 13(3) of the Act itself 
provides that "Where a decree relates to the payment of 
money and the decretal amount is not paid within the 
time specified by the Court [not exceeding thirty days] the 
same shall, if the Court so directs to recover as arrears of 
land revenue, and on recovery shall be paid to the 
decree-holder.”

8. 
Having above-examined legal position in sight regarding the 
powers of the learned Executing Court in family matters to execute 
the decree, this Court is of considered opinion that though an 
Executing Court cannot travel beyond the decree while implementing 
the same, however, that does not mean that it has no duty to find out 
true effect of the decree. For construing a decree, the learned 
Executing Court can in appropriate cases, opt to take into 
consideration the pleadings as well as proceedings leading upto the 
judgment that forms the foundation of the decree. In order to find out 
meaning and scope of the words employed in the decree, the 
Executing Court often has to ascertain the circumstances under which 
those words have been or can be used. In fact, this is plain duty of the 
learned Executing Court and, in the instant case, it is admitted feature 
of the case that initial claim in a suit for recovery of dowry articles or 
its alternate value was Rs.2,740,500/- and the learned Trial Court only 
decreed an amount of Rs.350,000/-, which the petitioner/judgment 
debtor acknowledges as no appeal was preferred by him but when the 
appeal of the respondent/decree holder was taken by the learned 
Appellate Court below, the same was partially allowed as reflected in 
the impugned decree that has attained finality and in order to ascertain 
the exact scope as to what extent, appeal of the respondent/decree 
holder was accepted, the judgment dated 20.05.2022 can be looked 
into and its paragraph 11 is unequivocally clear, operative part 
whereof is reproduced hereunder: 
“11. …Therefore, the alternate amount in lieu of dowry 
article is enhanced to Rs.5,00,000/-. In view of my  
observations, the findings of the learned Judge Family 
Court on issue No.1 are modified and the Appellant is 
held entitled to receive Rs.5,00,000/- as alternate amount 
of dowry articles.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
It is para 11 of the judgment dated 20.05.2022 that is foundation of 
the impugned decree and, hence, clarifies the scope of the words

W.P No.14105/2023 
„partially allowed‟ used in the impugned decree. The learned 
Executing Court as well as the learned Appellate Court below have 
rightly appreciated this aspect and sought clarification from para 11 of 
the judgment, reproduced above. 
9. 
In view of the above discussion, this Court is of the view that 
both the learned Courts below have not committed any illegality, 
procedural impropriety or misconstruction of the record. As a natural 
corollary, no interference is called for. The instant petition is 
dismissed.
