JUDGMENT 
 
Muhammad Farooq 
VERSUS 
Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited 
 
Date of hearing: 20.06.2023 
 
Appellant by: 
Muhammad Suleman Bhatti, Advocate. 
  
 
 
Respondents by: 
Rao Riasat Ali Khan, Advocate. 
-------------------------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
 
MUZAMIL AKHTAR SHABIR, J. Through this appeal filed 
under Section 22 of Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) 
Ordinance, 2001 (“the Ordinance”), the appellant (judgment-debtor) 
has called in question the judgment & decree dated 15.08.2022 
(“impugned decree”) passed by learned Judge Banking Court No.II, 
Multan (“Banking Court”) whereby application for leave to defend 
filed by the appellant under section 10 of the Ordinance has been 
dismissed and the recovery suit filed by the respondent-bank under 
section 9 of the Ordinance was decreed to the tune of Rs.939,085.86 
against the appellant, in favour of respondent-bank. 
2. 
It is contended by learned counsel for the appellant that 
admittedly original documents relating to finance advanced to the 
appellant were not available with the respondent-bank and the claim 
of the appellant was that the said documents had been returned to the 
appellant on repayment of loan, whereas on the other hand the claim 
of the respondent was that the said documents had been snatched by 
the appellant from the officer of the Bank, which was a triable issue 
therefore, to establish genuineness of the claim of the parties, the 
Court was required to grant to the appellant leave to defend the suit 

R.F.A. No. 299 of 2022 
2 
 
but the said aspect of the matter was not given due consideration by 
Judge Banking Court while dismissing the application for leave to 
defend filed by the appellant solely on the ground that it did not meet 
with requirements of section 10 of the Ordinance, resulting in the suit 
for recovery filed by the respondent-bank being decreed against the 
appellant, which according to the learned counsel was not sustainable 
and liable to be set aside. 
3. 
On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent-bank has 
defend the impugned order by stating that appellant himself had 
snatched the original documents from officers of respondent-bank for 
which an F.I.R. was registered against the appellant and the 
respondent-Bank filed the titled recovery suit with which scanned 
copies of original documents retained in the office of respondent-bank 
were attached, which documents were as good as the original 
documents and clearly establish the claim of respondent-bank against 
the appellant, besides the appellant had not raised any legal or factual 
ground entitling the appellant for grant of leave to defend and inter 
alia on the basis of aforementioned grounds it is claimed that while 
rightly dismissing the application for leave to defend, suit was decreed 
against the appellant. 
4. 
We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused 
the record with their able assistance. 
5. 
Perusal of the record shows that the respondent-bank filed suit 
for recovery of Rs.1,001,170/- along with markup and cost of funds 
and other charges till realization under Section 9 of the Ordinance by 
claiming therein that appellant applied to the respondent-bank for 
obtaining Agricultural loan in the heads of production and 
development finances which were sanctioned for Rs. 8,80,000/- and 
disbursed on 12.09.2019 under the G.L. Head nos. 9160, 9303, 9417 
and 
9018 
of 
Rs.270,000/-, 
Rs.270,000/-, 
Rs.110,000/- 
and 
Rs.230,000/- repayable with mark-up rates of 14%, 14.8%, 14.8% and 
14% respectively according to bank policy. For obtaining the said 

R.F.A. No. 299 of 2022 
3 
 
loan/Finance facility, the appellant mortgaged his agricultural 
property measuring 40 Kanals and 15 Marlas in Mouza Laabar, Tehsil 
Multan details of which were mentioned in his Zarai Pass book No. 
023608 and encumbrance/mortgage mutation No. 4630 dated 
28.03.2013 of his agricultural land was entered the revenue record in 
favour of respondent-bank and for the said purpose the appellant also 
executed Loan application, Finance Agreement, Sanction Advice, 
D.P. Note, Charge creation certificate, Acknowledgement and other 
concerned/relevant documents relating to loan. Afterwards obtaining 
loan, it is claimed that the appellant paid nothing and failed to 
liquidate the loan liability and a sum of Rs.1,001,170/- was 
outstanding against the appellant as on 28.08.2020. The appellant on 
being asked to pay the loan amount failed to adjust the same and on 
11.06.2020 snatched the original loan case file from the Bank officers 
and refused to pay the outstanding amount, resulting in registration of 
FIR No. 572/2020 under Sections 353, 382, 379 & 186 PPC against 
the appellant with Police Station Muzaffarabad, Multan, proceedings 
under criminal law arising out of which are still pending with the 
court of competent jurisdiction. The appellant thereafter filed a suit 
for declaration titled Muhammad Farooque vs ZTBL to the effect that 
he had repaid all the outstanding loan amount and pass book was 
returned to him and thereafter nothing was due against him and 
prayed that mandatory injunction be granted against the appellant to 
issue NOC and to redeem the mortgaged property and not to demand 
any amount from the appellant. The same necessitated the filing of the 
instant suit for recovery by the respondent Bank against the appellant.  
6. 
Appellant on being summoned filed application for leave to 
defend with the assertion that the appellant in the year 2013 availed a 
loan facility of Rs. 800,000/- from the respondent Bank, which was 
required to be repaid in 6 years by installments with last installment 
due to be paid in September, 2019 and the appellant had paid the said 
installments and requested the plaintiff bank to redeem property of the 
appellant. The respondent Bank manager promised to redeem the 

R.F.A. No. 299 of 2022 
4 
 
property but lingered on with the same and although original pass 
book was returned back to the appellant yet redemption letter was not 
issued, consequently on 20.06.2020, petitioner filed a suit for 
declaration in the Banking Court which is still pending and in the 
meanwhile 11.06.2020 the Bank Manager got registered Criminal case 
bearing FIR No. 572 of 2020 against the appellant for snatching away 
original file from the Bank Manager. Although, appellant accepted 
having obtained loan facility in the year 2013 yet in his application for 
leave to defend mentioned that said facility had been repaid and 
original documents of finance facility were not available with the 
respondent-bank as the same had been returned on repayment of 
finance but the officers of respondent Bank has not made relevant 
corresponding entries in the record and it is claimed that no new 
finance facility/loan was obtained by the Appellant, however, it was 
not denied that F.I.R. for snatching of said documents from the 
officers of respondent-bank was registered against the appellant, and 
inter alia on the basis of the afore-mentioned circumstances, it was 
claimed that leave to defend was required to be granted to the 
appellant. For ready reference some excerpts of relevant portions of 
application for leave to defend are reproduced below:- 
“1.  
That in 2013, petitioner /defendant availed a loan 
facility for Rs8,00,000/- from the plaintiff bank which was 
required to be paid in 6 years by installments, last installment 
was to be paid in September, 2019. The petitioner defendant 
accordingly paid the said installments and requested the 
plaintiff bank to redeem property of the petitioner/defendant. 
The respondent bank manager promised to redeem the 
property but lingered on the same, although original pass 
book was returned back to the petitioner but redemption letter 
was not issued, consequently on 20.06.2020, petitioner filed a 
suit for declaration in this Honorable Court which remained 
sub judice in this Honorable Court and was dismissed for 
non-prosecution on 02-11-2021, for the restoration of which 
application is being filed, in the meanwhile, bank manager on 
11.06.2020 got registered Criminal Case bearing FIR 
No.572/20 against the petitioner on the allegations that 
petitioner had snatched original file from the plaintiff bank 
manager, hence, committed the offence, in which on 
25.06.2020 
petitioner/defendant 
filed 
pre-arrest 
bail 
application in the Court of Learned Session Judge, Multan 
which was entrusted to Mr. Izhar-ul-Haq, Learned Additional 
Session Judge, Multan for the decision in accordance with 

R.F.A. No. 299 of 2022 
5 
 
law. The Learned Additional Session Judge, Multan, on 
06.10.2020 was pleased to confirm pre-arrest bail of the 
petitioner in which for and against arguments were recorded. 
It was specifically mentioned that petitioner had already 
cleared the principal and mark up amount secured by him in 
the year 2013. As per FIR time of occurrence was mentioned 
as 07:30 a.m. in FIR, whereas, that was not working hours of 
the bank officials because in Pakistan opening time of banks 
is 9.00 a.m., that is why story narrated by bank officials in 
FIR was not accepted by the Learned Additional Sessions 
Judge, even otherwise, other merits of the case were also 
taken into consideration and finally case was found fit for 
grant of pre-arrest bail. 
2. 
…… ………… ……… …… ….  ………….  ……..  
……….   ………..  …………..  …………..  ………… 
3. 
The bank officials while filing titled suit have claimed 
an amount of Rs. 8,80,000/- as disbursed amount against 
Loan Case No. 706127, while annexing voucher of Rs. 
63,794/- and Cheque of Rs. 921,000/- in the name of the 
petitioner, which facts are sufficient to disbelieve the story 
put forward by the bank officials for establishing their case 
because in plaint different amounts under different heads are 
shown as disbursed amount whereas, through cheque of Rs. 
921,000/- is shown disbursement of amount in one go, which 
is contrary to the record and documents produced by the 
bank itself. 
4. 
…….  ………  ……….. In para No. 2 against column 
No. 2, date of disbursement of amount is shown as 12.09.2019 
whereas, the expiry date is mentioned as 15.07.2019, 
meaning thereby, amount is required to be adjusted before its 
disbursement, somewhat how, other documents are also 
mentioned under the same analogy having no backing. 
Hence, case for grant of leave application is made out.  
5. 
That no document is available with the bank except 
photocopies, which are pertaining to previous loan case and 
original of which are not available with the bank. The bank 
officials have also tempered dates and loan cases numbers, 
hence, petitioners case is fully made out.  
6. 
…… ………… ……… …… ….  ………….  ……..  
……….   ………..  …………..  …………..  ………… 
7. 
That details in terms of Section 10(3)(4)(5)&(6) of the 
Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance 
2001 are as under:- 
 
Finance availed: 
 Nil 
 
Finance Repaid: 
 Nil 
Outstanding:           Nil (Entire amount of outstanding 
liability is disputed). 
8. 
That Section 9 of the Ordinance prescribes that suit of 
the Financial Institutions must be supported by all the 

R.F.A. No. 299 of 2022 
6 
 
requisite documents including a valid statement of account. It 
is settled laws that both credit and debit entries should be 
particularized in such a manner that the statement discloses a 
true and fair picture. All the entries in the statement of 
account must be clearly described so as to ascertain from 
which account they have been entered and into which account 
the same were further transferred. It is specially averred that 
no valid statement of account is appended with the plaint 
neither the entries therein corroborated with other documents 
appended with the plaint. The statement of account attached 
with the plaint is not the statement of account as required 
under Section 4 of Banker‟s Books of Evidence Act. By mere 
verifying the document it does not attain the status of a true 
and valid statements, hence, no statement of account has been 
attached with the plaint which is a pre-requisite for filing a 
suit u/s 9 of Ordinance 2001, hence, the suit in the absence of 
statement of account is liable to be dismissed. 
9. 
…… ………… ……… …… ….  ………….  ……..  
……….   ………..  …………..  …………..  ………… 
10. 
That Section 9 of the Ordinance, as well as Article 48 
of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, requires that the suit 
must be supported by relevant documents. The plaintiff has 
based its claim on the fact that the Finance Facility was 
provided, (the “Finance Facility”). However, there is no 
document to support this claim. Hence, suit is liable to be 
dismissed.” 
7. 
The respondent bank controverted the stance of the appellant by 
filing reply to the application for leave to defend. The learned 
Banking Court did not agree with the stance taken by the appellant in 
its application for leave to defend and dismissed the same. The details 
are mentioned in the impugned order, however, this court has gone 
through the impugned order whereby the Banking Court has dealt 
with the stance of the appellant regarding non-availability of original 
documents with the respondent Bank. The excerpt of the relevant 
portion is reproduced below:- 
“5. ……………….. The defendant‟s version of fabrication of 
documents by the bank officials does not fall within the ambit 
of jurisdiction of this court. Moreover, the suit has been filed 
on 06.11.2020 and the defendant filed application for leave to 
defend the suit on 29.11.2021 and even till date, the defendant 
has not produced any document showing his intent to 
challenge the validity of documents produced by the plaintiff 
bank nor he filed any case against the alleged fraud 
committed by bank officials at any proper forum, which itself 
negates the story concocted by the defendant. Although 
original documents are not available with the plaintiff but 

R.F.A. No. 299 of 2022 
7 
 
scanned attested copies have been produced by the plaintiff 
kept in due course of business by the financial institution. 
Mere oral assertion of the defendant without any supporting 
document or proof is not enough to draw any adverse 
presumption against the credibility of the documents and 
statements of accounts produced by the bank. The defendant 
has not specifically denied his signatures and thumb 
impression on the finance documents not did he produce any 
copy of request to the plaintiff for redemption of his property. 
The finance documents have duly been prepared and those 
are not violating any clause of Contract Act or Qanoon-e-
Shahadat Ordinance 1984. The defendant has not produced 
any proof regarding repayment of loan along with his PLA. 
PLA is not fulfilling the requirements of Section 10(3&4) of 
FIO, 2001 and on this ground alone it is liable to be rejected 
under Section 10(6) of the ordinance ibid. As no substantial 
Question of law and fact has been raised for the 
determination of which recording of evidence is required, 
therefore, PLA is rejected being meritless.  
(emphasis supplied) 
8. 
The learned Banking Court after dismissing the PLA also 
decreed the suit filed by the respondent bank for Recovery of Rs. 
9,39,085.86 in favour of the respondent Bank and against the 
appellant along with costs of suit and costs of funds from 01.03.2020 
till the realization of decretal amount/outstanding amount. However, it 
was observed that any amount deposited by the appellant during 
pendency of the suit shall be deducted from the decretal amount. 
9. 
We have noticed that the banking court has specifically 
observed that the appellant’s/defendant’s version of fabrication of 
documents by the bank officials does not fall within the ambit of 
jurisdiction of the Banking Court. The Banking Court further 
observed that although original documents are not available with the 
plaintiff (i.e. respondent Bank) but scanned attested copies have been 
produced by the plaintiff (i.e. respondent Bank) kept in due course of 
business by the financial institution and mere oral assertion of the 
defendant (i.e. appellant) without any supporting document or proof is 
not enough to draw any adverse presumption against the credibility of 
the documents and statements of accounts produced by the bank. 
These observations recorded by the Banking Court were not based on 
proper appreciation of the law and facts of the case and were not 
sustainable especially when in view of mandatory requirement of 

R.F.A. No. 299 of 2022 
8 
 
Section 9 of Ordinance, the respondent bank was required to produce 
on record not only the duly certified statement of accounts certified 
under the Bankers Books Evidence Act, 1891 but plaint also was 
required to be supported by relevant documents relating to grant of 
finance, which implies that the said documents in original were 
assumed to be actually maintained by the bank in its office. The 
operative portion of section is reproduced below: 
“9.  
Procedure of Banking Courts.- (1) Where a customer 
or a financial institution commits a default in fulfillment of 
any obligation with regard to any finance, the financial 
institution or, as the case may be, the customer, may institute 
a suit in the Banking Court by presenting a plaint which shall 
be verified on oath, in the case of a financial institution by the 
Branch Manager or such other officer of the financial 
institution as may be duly authorized in this behalf by power 
of attorney or otherwise. 
(2) The plaint shall be supported by a statement of account 
which in the case of a financial institution shall be duly 
certified under the Bankers Books Evidence Act, 1891 (XVII 
of 1891), and all other relevant documents relating to the 
grant of finance. Copies of the plaint, statement of account 
and other relevant documents shall be filed with the Banking 
Court in sufficient numbers so that there is one set of copies 
for each defendant and one extra copy. 
(3) The plaint, in the case of a suit for recovery instituted by a 
financial institution, shall specifically state__ 
(a) the amount of finance availed by the defendant 
from the financial institution; 
(b) the amounts paid by the defendant to the financial 
institution and the dates of payment; and 
(c) the amount of finance and other amounts relating 
to the finance payable by the defendant to the financial 
institution upto the date of institution of the suit.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
10. 
It is also pertinent to mention here that the appellant as 
defendant was also required to file application for leave to defend in 
conformity with the mandatory provision of section 10 of the 
Ordinance, reproduced below; 
“10. Leave to defend. _ (1) In any case in which the summons 
has been served on the defendant as provided for in sub-
section (5) of section 9, the defendant shall not be entitled to 
defend the suit unless he obtains leave from the Banking 
Court as hereinafter provided to defend the same; and, in 

R.F.A. No. 299 of 2022 
9 
 
default of his doing so, the allegations of fact in the plaint 
shall be deemed to be admitted and the Banking Court may 
pass a decree in favour of the plaintiff on the basis thereof or 
such other material as the Banking Court may require in the 
interests of justice. 
(2) The defendant shall file the application for leave to defend 
within thirty days of the date of first service by any one of the 
modes laid down in sub-section (5) of section 9: 
Provided that where service has been validly effected only 
through publication in the newspapers, the Banking Court 
may extend the time for filing an application for leave to 
defend if satisfied that the defendant did not have knowledge 
thereof. 
(3) The application for leave to defend shall be in the form of 
a written statement, and shall contain a summary of the 
substantial questions of law as well as fact in respect of 
which, in the opinion of the defendant, evidence needs to be 
recorded. 
(4) In the case of a suit for recovery instituted by a financial 
institution the application for leave to defend shall also 
specifically state the following __ 
(a) the amount of finance availed by the defendant 
from the financial institution; the amount paid by the 
defendant to the financial institution and the dates of 
payments; 
(b) the amount of finance and other amounts relating 
to the finance payable by the defendant to the financial 
institution upto the date of institution of the suit; 
(c) the amount of finance and other amounts relating 
to the finance payable by the defendant to the financial 
institution upto the date of institution of the suit, 
(d) the amount if any which the defendant disputes as 
payable to the financial institution and facts in support 
thereof: 
Explanation.- For the purposes of clause (b) any payment 
made to a financial institution by a customer in respect of a 
finance shall be appropriated first against other amounts 
relating to the finance and the balance, if any, against the 
principal amount of the finance. 
(5) Where application for leave to defend submitted under the 
preceding sub-section is found to be materially incorrect at 
any stage of the proceedings, the defendant shall lose the 
right to defence and shall also be liable to pay penalty of not 
less than five percent of the amount to the claim, unless the 
defendant can establish that incorrect information was 
submitted as a result of a bona fide mistake. 

R.F.A. No. 299 of 2022 
10 
 
(6) The application for leave to defend shall be accompanied 
by all the documents which, in the opinion of the defendant, 
support the substantial questions of law or fact raised by him. 
(7) An application for leave to defend which does not comply 
with the requirements of subsections (3), (4) where applicable 
and (5) shall be rejected, unless the defendant discloses 
therein sufficient cause for his inability to comply with any 
such requirement. 
11. 
The requirements of both sections 9 and 10 of the Ordinance 
have been declared to be mandatory by the Honourable Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in the case titled Apollo Textile Mills Ltd. and 
others versus Soneri Bank Ltd. (PLD 2012 SC 268). The operative 
portion of the judgment is reproduced below:- 
“20. Dr. Farogh Naseem, learned Advocate Supreme Court 
for the petitioners placed heavy reliance on the judgment in 
the case of "Bankers Equity Limited through Principal Law 
Officer and 5 others v. Messrs Bentonite Pakistan  Limited 
and 7 others" (2003 CLD 931), composed by one of us 
(Justice Muhammad Sair Ali) while in the Lahore High 
Court, Lahore. This judgment was maintained by an Hon‟ble 
Division Bench in the case of “Bankers Equity Limited and 5 
others v. Messrs Bentonite Pakistan Limited through Chief 
Executive and 7 others” (2010 CLD 651) and was also 
referred to and relied upon by various Hon‟ble Benches in 
the cases quoted by the learned counsel. In this judgment both 
the above reproduced Sections i.e. sections 9 and 10 came 
under discussion. This judgment also bears identity of facts 
and the law to the case in hand. The defendants in the 
referred case also failed to particularize their objections and 
had not pleaded Accounts under section 10 of the Ordinance, 
2001 like in the present case. Their petition for leave to 
defend was rejected under subsection (6) of section 10 ibid as 
under:-- 
“5.---Learned counsel for the applicants/defendants 
candidly admitted that no such account or tabulation  
was made in the PLA. In absence of such an account 
and for not being in the form of a written statement, 
the PLA was rejectable under subsection (6) of section 
10 of the Ordinance, 2001, for not complying with the 
mandatory requirements of subsections (3) and (4) of 
section 10 ibid”. 
Upon rejection of defendants petition for leave to defendant 
the suit, the court on its own examination of the plaint of the 
plaintiff financial Institutions and the documents therewith, 
rejected the plaint as well by holding that:-- 
“7. ............ subsection (2) of section 9 of the Financial 
Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance, 2001 
makes it mandatory for a Banking institution to 

R.F.A. No. 299 of 2022 
11 
 
support its plaint in a suit against the customer by a 
Statement of Account duly certified under the Bankers‟ 
Books Evidence Act, 1891 and also by all other 
relevant documents relating to grant of finance. 
Without such a „Statement of Account‟ filed along with 
the plaint, a customer will obviously remain totally 
unaware of the amount advanced, mark up charged 
and the basis, break up, premise, mode of calculation 
of account, nature of default and the actual amount of 
Bank‟s claim against the defendant-customer. He will 
thus be unable to frame his defence within the limited 
period prescribed by law, to show reasonable, serious 
and plausible grounds of contest to be able to seek and 
obtain leave to defend the suit. Absence of filing the 
requisite Statements of Account along with the plaint, 
will essentially amount to absence of providing 
adequate, proper and reasonable opportunity of 
defence to the defending customer. Being thus unable 
to file a proper leave petition within thirty days under 
section 10(2) of the  Ordinance  of  2001  or  within  
twenty-one  days  under section 10(12) ibid, such a 
customer may or may not later be able to amend his 
leave petition. His defence shall thus be rendered 
illusory, hence denied. Upon the compliance a 
Banking Company with the provisions of section 9(2) 
of the Ordinance of 2001, depends the right of defence 
of a defendant in the summary suits as visualized 
under the Ordinance, wherefor, the filing of duly 
certified Statements of Account by a Banking company 
along with its plaint, cannot be taken to be a mere 
formality or a technicality. This provision  can  only  
be  held to be mandatory. Without strict compliance 
wherewith, the plaint is  incomplete  and  cannot  
become  basis  of  a  suit  under  this law”. 
21. The similarity of the provisions legislated in sections 9 
and 10 ibid, as discussed above, leads to identical 
consequences in the absence of the demanded Accounts and 
the documents. Suit of the plaintiff institution will be 
rejectable while defendants‟ leave petition will be exposed to 
rejection etc. A Plaintiff institution may be rendered unable 
or deficient in appropriately setting up its answers to the 
accounts, disputed amounts and facts of the defendant in 
reply to the leave application as per section 10(8) ibid. And 
that in the absence of the requisite accounts and the facts etc. 
in defence filed by a defendant in the leave petition, a plaintiff 
will remain unaware of the admitted or denied or disputed 
accounts and facts of the defendants, to adequately, seriously 
and reasonably pursue the suit and its trial. This will 
obviously defeat the intent and the object of the provided 
provisions of The Financial Institutions (Recovery of 
Finances) Ordinance, 2001). 
22. Despite rejection of the leave petition as above, and loss 
of the right to defend the suit, the learned Advocate Supreme 

R.F.A. No. 299 of 2022 
12 
 
Court for the petitioner/defendants insisted that the Courts 
should have considered the request of the petitioners for 
rejection of the plaint as in above referred case of “Bankers 
Equity Limited through Principal Law Officer and 5 others v. 
Messrs Bentonite Pakistan Limited and 7 others” (2003 CLD 
931), on the purported basis of incomplete Statements of 
Accounts. The cases referred to by the learned counsel did 
adjudge that in the absence of the support of Statements of 
Accounts and finance documents, Bank‟s plaint was liable to 
be rejected. The learned counsel does not appear to have 
examined the reasons upon which the said judgments were 
founded. Consequent upon the rejection of the leave petition, 
the defendants were deemed to have admitted the contents of 
the plaint. The defendants remained bound thereto. The Court 
of course was not so bound. It was not expected to proceed 
blindfolded. The court therefor in performance of its duty, 
itself examine in the said cases (as in this case) the  plaint  
along  with  documents  to  decide  as  to  whether  the  suit 
complied with the mandatory provisions of section 9 ibid or 
not and as to the  nature  of  the  order,  judgment  or  decree  
to  be  passed  by  the Court.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
12. 
The afore-mentioned judgment of the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan was relied upon by this Court in case titled The Bank of 
Punjab versus Fazal Abbas and another (2020 CLD 977) and this 
Court dismissed the suit filed by the bank as not maintainable due to 
non-compliance of mandatory requirement of sub-sections 2 & 3 of 
section 9, by holding as under: 
“9.    The counsel for the appellant despite his hectic efforts 
has not been able to show us that the mandatory requirements 
of section 9(2&3) of the Ordinance had been properly 
followed and complied with, therefore, the suit filed by the 
appellant failing to comply with the aforesaid mandatory 
requirement of law was liable to be dismissed. Reliance is 
placed on Apollo Textile Mills Ltd and others v. Soneri Bank 
Limited (PLD 2012 SC 268). Consequently, the Banking 
Court was justified in deciding both the afore referred issues 
Nos. 3 and 5 against the appellant and dismissing the suit 
filed by the appellant. The appellant has failed to show any 
illegality, erroneous exercise of jurisdiction or misreading 
and non-reading of the relevant record to warrant 
interference in the well-founded judgment of the Banking 
Court whereby suit of the appellant has been dismissed.”

In the present case it was specifically mentioned in the 
application for leave to defend that loan financing facility of 
Rs.800,000/- was obtained by the appellant from respondent-bank in 
the year 2013 which was required to be repaid within six years till

September, 2019 and the same was repaid by the appellant and 
accordingly original passbook was returned to the appellant and the 
Manager of the bank promised to issue redemption letter to the 
appellant but never issued the same to the appellant and hence the 
appellant filed suit for declaration on 20.06.2020 to absolve him of the 
said finance facility and redeem his property. Manager, on the other 
hand, got registered F.I.R. No.572 of 2020 against appellant for 
snatching of original loan case file from the officers of respondent-
bank and in the said case pre-arrest bail of the appellant was 
confirmed and the trial of the said case is still stated to be pending. An 
objection was raised by the respondent-bank that PLA was barred by 
time, however, the learned Judge Banking Court overruled the said 
objection and held PLA to be within time, however, declined the PLA 
on the ground that the appellant has categorically prayed that the 
amount of finance availed has been repaid and should have been 
mentioned the date of repayment which was not done whereas 
statements of accounts issued by the respondent-bank is in accordance 
with Bankers Book of Evidence Act, 1891 and while relying upon the 
said statement of account dismissed the application of PLA without 
taking into consideration the main ground raised by the appellant that 
original documents were not available with the respondent-bank and 
consequently suit without granting leave to defend could not have 
been decreed. In this scenario the dictates of latter portion of section 
10 sub-section (7) of the Ordinance become important which provides 
that an application for leave to defend, which does not comply with 
the requirements of subsections (3), (4) where applicable and (5) shall 
be rejected, unless the defendant discloses therein sufficient cause for 
his inability to comply with any such requirement. The appellant had 
claimed that the original loan obtained in the year 2013 had been 
repaid and original documents had been returned and were not 
available with the bank and no subsequent loan was obtain in the year 
2019 and the case had been filed on basis of fabricated and tempered 
copies of documents relating to previous loan/finance facility; hence 
amount of loan obtained, amount repaid and amount due were Nil. 

R.F.A. No. 299 of 2022

These grounds were required to be considered while deciding 
application for leave to defend, but apparently the same has escaped 
the attention of the Banking Court and the court wrongly observed 
that the appellant’s version of fabrication of documents by the bank 
officials does not fall within the ambit of jurisdiction of Banking 
Court, hence order of dismissal of application for leave to defend does 
not seem to be based on proper appreciation of record of the case and 
law on the subject. 
14. 
Although, learned counsel for the respondent-bank states that 
duplicate file containing scanned document, which is as good as 
original, is retained by the respondent-bank in its records yet whether 
the said duplicate file is to be treated as good as its original file or not, 
or its’ substitute and whether such documents could be treated as 
primary evidence or were required to be established through 
secondary evidence, are questions which were required to be 
determined; besides safekeeping of documents was also question 
which could have bearing upon final judgment to be arrived at in the 
matter. Keeping the afore-referred aspect of the matter in 
juxtaposition with the defence of the appellant that he had repaid the 
previous loan in the year 2019 in which original pass book/finance 
document were returned to him and remaining documents including 
NOC were promised to be issued by respondent-Bank including letter 
of redemption, etc. and no new loan was obtained by him in the year 
2019 and in these circumstances, non-availability of original file with 
the respondent-bank, entitles the appellant for grant of leave to defend 
as the same raised substantial question of law and fact requiring 
recording of evidence for determination, which aspect of the matter 
has not been considered by the learned Banking Court. 
15. 
Consequently, we set aside the impugned judgment & decree 
dated 15.08.2022 passed by Judge Banking Court No-II, Multan and 
remand the matter to the learned Banking Court by granting leave to 
defend to the appellant for decision of the matter afresh on its own 
merits in accordance with law.  

R.F.A. No. 299 of 2022

For what has been discussed above, this appeal is allowed in 
the afore-referred terms.
