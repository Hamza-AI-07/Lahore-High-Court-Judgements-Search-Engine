Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – Respondent No.2 filed a private 
complaint under sections 337-F(i), 337-F(ii), 337-L(2), 448, 354, 452, 282, 
148 & 149 PPC titled “Shahnaz Parveen v. Muhammad Safdar etc.” in the 
Court of the Additional Sessions Judge, Muzaffargarh, alleging that she 
married Muhammad Safdar who gave her a house measuring 01 kanal 13 
marlas in Chah Itrawala, Mouza Daira Din Panah, Tehsil and District Kot 
Addu, by way of dower (the “House”). The marriage could not continue. 
Safdar divorced her and shifted to WAPDA Colony to live with his second 
wife. According to Respondent No.2, she resided in the House for several 
years as an owner and continued to live there even after the divorce. On 
16.06.2020, around 9/10 a.m., she was alone there when Muhammad Safdar 
and his co-accused, including the Petitioners, trespassed the House while 
armed with different weapons and began beating her. As a result, she 
suffered injuries on her right leg, left arm and neck. Her hue and cry 
attracted witnesses to the scene. She further stated that the accused ejected 
her from the House and took over its possession. She lodged FIR 
No.245/2020 dated 19.06.2020 at Police Station Daira Din Panah regarding 
the incident, but the accused, who are lawyers, influenced the investigation.

The police declared them innocent, forcing her to institute a private 
complaint for redress. 
2. 
 
The Additional Sessions Judge recorded cursory evidence of 
Respondent No.2 (the complainant) as PW-1, and two witnesses, 
Muhammad Aqeel and Muhammad Shakeel, as PW-2 and PW-3 
respectively. Respondent No.2 also produced documentary evidence  
(Exh.PA to PD and Mark-A to Mark-L) to support her claim. The Additional 
Sessions Judge admitted the private complaint and summoned Safdar and 
the 
Petitioners 
to 
face 
trial 
by 
order 
dated 
04.02.2023  
(the “Impugned Order”). This revision petition under sections 439/435 
Cr.P.C. is directed against that order. 
3. 
 
The Petitioners contend that the Impugned Order is without 
jurisdiction because the Additional Sessions Judge has entertained the 
private complaint of Respondent No.2 directly in violation of sections 190 
and 193 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (hereafter referred to as 
the “Code” or “Cr.P.C.”). He could not take cognizance unless the 
Magistrate forwarded it to him. On merits, they claim that the allegations 
against them are baseless and vexatious. Respondent No.2 initially lodged 
FIR No.245/2020 against them and Safdar, which the police investigated and 
found false. Respondent No.2 has now filed a private complaint on the same 
facts. She has a dispute with Safdar over the House and wants to drive him 
towards a compromise by entangling them in false criminal cases. According 
to them, she has implicated them in this case because they are Safdar’s 
friends. 
4. 
 
The Deputy Prosecutor General has supported this petition on 
the legal plane.  
5. 
 
The counsel for Respondent No.2 has, however, defended the 
Impugned Order on legal and factual grounds. He maintains that the 
Petitioners have not been prejudiced because of the Additional Sessions 
Judge directly entertaining the private complaint. It is merely an irregularity 
curable under section 537 Cr.P.C. He has relied upon Muhammad Saeed 
and others v. The State and others (1984 PCr.LJ 1373), Damon and 6 
others v. The State and another (1992 MLD 1993), and Mst. Mariam 
Sultana v. The State (PLD 2000 Quetta 12) in support of this contention. On 

Crl. Revision No. 148/2023

merits, the learned counsel states that sufficient incriminating evidence is 
available on record to justify the summoning of the Petitioners and their co-
accused for trial.  
Opinion 
6. 
 
Section 190(1) Cr.P.C. states that all Magistrates of the First 
Class or any other Magistrate specially empowered by the Provincial 
Government on the recommendation of the High Court may take cognizance 
of any offence (a) upon receiving a complaint, (b) upon a report by any 
police officer, (c) upon receiving information from anyone other than a 
police officer, or upon his knowledge or suspicion that an offence has been 
committed. Section 190(2) Cr.P.C. stipulates that a Magistrate taking 
cognizance of an offence triable exclusively by the Court of Session shall 
send the case to that court for trial without recording any evidence. Section 
193 Cr.P.C. ordains that, except as otherwise expressly provided by the 
Code or any other legislation in force, no Court of Session shall take 
cognizance of any offence as a court of original jurisdiction unless the case 
has been sent to it under section 190(2). And section 193(2) stipulates that 
an Additional Sessions Judge shall try only such cases as the Sessions Judge 
assigns to them for trial or the Provincial Government by general or special 
order may direct. 
7. 
 
To comprehend the scheme of law regarding cognizance of 
offences by the courts of original jurisdiction, it is necessary to look at the 
legislative history. Ch. Ejaz Yousaf J. has ably traced it in Bismillah Khan 
and others v. The State (2001 PCr.LJ 481). The original section 193(1) of 
the Code provided that “no Court of Session shall take cognizance of an 
offence as a court of original jurisdiction unless the accused has been 
committed to it by a Magistrate duly empowered in that behalf.” The Law 
Reforms Ordinance 1972 abolished committal processes and substituted the 
words “commit for trial” used in the last part of section 190(1) with the 
words “sent to the Court of Session for trial.” Similarly, it replaced the 
wording “committed to the Court of Session” in section 191 Cr.P.C. with the 
phrase “sent to the Court of Session”. In section 193(1) also, the Ordinance 
substituted the words “unless the accused has been committed to it by a 
Magistrate duly empowered in that behalf” with the expression “unless the

- 4 - 
case has been sent to it under section 190(3) Cr.P.C.”1 Before the 
aforementioned amendments, there was a judicial consensus that, except in 
cases where a Court of Session was expressly empowered to take cognizance 
of offence as a Court of original jurisdiction, it lacked the power to do so 
unless a commitment has been made by a Magistrate duly empowered in that 
regard. 
8. 
 
After the amendments mentioned above, the Magistrate was not 
required to record evidence where the case was triable exclusively by a 
Court of Session. Therefore, the question arose as to whether, the committal 
proceedings having been abolished, the Session Court was competent to take 
cognizance of an offence directly without the medium of the Magistrate. In 
Muhammad Aslam and others v. Mst. Natho Bibi (PLD 1977 Lahore 535), 
this Court held that the Magistrate retains the power of taking cognizance in 
all cases whether triable by him or by the Court of Session, with the only 
difference that before the amendment he could try cases which fell within 
his jurisdiction and would commit only those cases for trial which would fall 
in the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Session. The learned Judge 
pointed out that the word “Court” has been substituted for the term 
“Magistrate” under section 202 Criminal Procedure Code, but the same has 
been kept in the text of sections 190, 200 and 201 Cr.P.C. He further stated: 
 
“As to the argument of the learned Assistant Advocate-General that this 
interpretation would lead to absurdity because it will serve no meaningful 
purpose as a case which is ultimately to be tried by the Court of Session 
should first be taken cognizance of by a Magistrate, it is sufficient to say 
that this enactment as it stands on the anvil of law, is not without wisdom. 
The Law Reforms Ordinance has laid a lot of emphasis on the form of the 
complaint to be made pertaining to the cases triable by the Court of 
Session, and for that reason, the power of the Magistrate to take initial 
cognizance of the same has been left intact. This duty has been assigned to 
the Magistrate under the law to scrutinize the complaints and to find 
whether they conform to the pro forma laid down in this behalf and 
applying his mind to the facts of the cue as stated in the complaint his 
discretion will always remain there to refuse to send the same to the Court 
of Session. This will positively reduce the burden which otherwise would 
have fallen on the Court of Session if this power had not been given by 
law to the Magistrate.” 
9. 
 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan approved the above view in 
Mehar Khan v. Yaqub Khan and another (1981 SCMR 267). It added that 
even under the amended provisions of section 190 Cr.P.C., the Magistrate 
                                          
1 See note 2.

was required to apply his mind to determine whether the case in question 
was one he was required to “send” for trial to the Court of Session or if he 
could try it himself. In Riffat Hayat v. Judge Special Court for Suppression 
of Terrorist Activities, Lahore, and another (1994 SCMR 2177), while 
considering the question as to whether the Special Court established under 
the Suppression of Terrorist Activities Act, 1975, could take cognizance of a 
case directly, the Supreme Court observed: 
 
“Subsection (3) of section 5 of the Act provides that the Special Court 
may directly take cognizance of a case triable by that Court without the 
case being sent to it under section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code. A 
comparison of provisions of section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code 
with section 5 of the Act will show that neither application of section 173 
nor section 190 of the Code is excluded either specifically or by necessary 
implication. The provisions relating to taking of direct cognizance by the 
Special Court contained in subsection (3) of section 5 of the Act is not a 
new one as a similar provision for taking cognizance of the case directly 
by a Magistrate already existed under subsection (2) of section 190 of the 
Code. Section 5 of the Act, which appears to be a combination of sections 
173 and 190 of the Code, differs from these provisions only to the extent 
hereinafter indicated ... A Court of Session under section 193 of the Code 
is debarred from taking cognizance of a case as a Court of original 
jurisdiction unless the case is sent to it by a Magistrate under section 
190(3) of the Code whereas a Special Court under the Act can take 
cognizance of a case directly as a Court of original jurisdiction in the same 
manner as a Magistrate is empowered to take cognizance of a case under 
section 190 of the Code.”2  
10. 
 
The principle that may be deduced from the above discussion is 
that a private complaint must be filed with the Magistrate unless the law 
permits otherwise. The Session Court cannot take cognizance of any offence 
as a court of original jurisdiction unless the Magistrate sends it the case 
under section 190(2) Cr.P.C.3  
11. 
 
I am not inclined to agree with the counsel for Respondent No.2 
that the direct institution of a private complaint is an irregularity curable 
under section 537 Cr.P.C. and does not vitiate the proceedings. The rule is 
well established that where the law requires an act to be done in a specific 
manner, it has to be done in that manner alone, and such dictate of law 
cannot be considered a mere technicality. (Latin maxim: a communi 
                                          
2 Act XXXVII of 2001 deleted sub-section (2) of section 190 of the Code and re-numbered sub-section (3) 
as sub-section (2) w.e.f. 13.08.2001. [See: PLJ 2001 Fed. St. 430]. Therefore, reference to section 190(3) 
Cr.P.C. in this excerpt may be considered as reference to the present section 190(2) Cr.P.C.  
3 The following cases also reiterate this principle: 
Bismillah Khan and other v. The State (2001 PCr.LJ 481); Muhammad Tayyab Abu Bakar v. Rana Masood 
Akhtar, Additional Sessions Judge Bahawalpur and others (2005 PCr.LJ 1496); Mst. Akhtar Bano v. Umar 
Baz and other (2006 PCr.LJ 1101); Rao Fahd Ali Khan v. The State and other (2014 PCr.LJ 1071).

observantia non est recedendum). In State of Uttar Pradesh vs Singhara 
Singh and others (AIR 1964 SC 358), the Supreme Court of India held that 
the rule established in Taylor v. Taylor [1875] 1 Ch. D. 426, 431, is well 
recognized and is founded on strong principles. As a result, if a statute 
confers a power to do an act and specifies how that authority must be 
exercised, it necessarily prohibits doing the act in any other manner than that 
which has been prescribed. The principle underlying the rule is that if this 
were not so, the statutory provision might not have been enacted. Apart from 
that, Article 189 of the Constitution of 1973 mandates that the law declared 
by the Supreme Court of Pakistan is binding on all the courts in the country. 
It has ruled that the provisions of sections 190 and 193 Cr.P.C. are 
mandatory, as discussed above. The authorities cited by the counsel for 
Respondent No.2 are distinguishable on facts and deviate from the Supreme 
Court’s dictum. 
12. 
 
In the present case, Respondent No.2 could not bypass the 
Magistrate while presenting her private complaint, and the Additional 
Sessions Judge wrongly assumed jurisdiction over it. The entire proceedings 
are liable to be quashed. Having held so, I need not go into the merits of the 
case. 
13. 
 
This petition is accepted and the proceedings in the private 
complaint titled “Shehnaz Parveen v. Muhammad Safdar etc.” undertaken by 
the Additional Sessions Judge are quashed. However, Respondent No.2 
would not be precluded from filing a fresh private complaint in accordance 
with the law.
