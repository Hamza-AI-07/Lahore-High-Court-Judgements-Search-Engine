“To constitute a customer, there must be some recognisable course or habits of dealing with nature of 
regular banking business… It has been thought difficult to reconcile the idea of a single transaction with 
that of a customer that the word predicate, even grammatically, some minimum of custom and 
antithetic to an isolated act.” According to this view in order to constitute a customer of a bank two 
conditions are to be fulfilled 
(a) He must have an account with the bank – i.e. savings account, current account, or fixed deposit 
account 
(b) The transactions between the banker and the customer should be of banking nature,  be in the form 
of regular banking nature. i.e., a person who approaches the bank for operating safe deposit 
Lockers for purchasing Travellers cheque is not a customer of the banks in search transactions do 
not come under the orbit of Banking transactions. 
(c) frequency of transactions is not quite necessary though anticipated”    
(Sir John R. Paget, British Jurist and Banking Expert/Author of Paget’s Law of Banking)1 
 
  
JAWAD HASSAN, J. This judgment will decide the suit 
filed under Section 9 of the Financial Institution (Recovery of 
Finances) Ordinance, 2001 (the “Ordinance”) pending since 2018 
whereby an amount of Rs.487,104,728.44/- along with mark-up at 
three months KIBOR plus twenty percent per annum alongwith cost 
of funds till date of realization (the “suit amount”) is claimed by the 
MCB Bank Limited (the “Plaintiff Bank”) being a financial

institution in terms of Section 2(a) of the “Ordinance” from Tanveer 
Spinning & Weaving Mills (Private) Limited (the “Defendant 
Company”) and its directors and guarantors, the Defendants No.2 to 4 
(the “Defendants”). The Summit Bank Limited and The Bank of 
Punjab were impleaded as pro-forma Defendants No.5 and 6 (the 
“Proforma Defendants”). The “Defendants” filed leave to defend 
(PLA No.205720 of 2018) the suit under Section 10 of the 
“Ordinance” whereby they have prayed to grant them unconditional 
leave to appear and defend the instant suit.  
2. 
Pertinently, this Court will only look into the contents of suit 
alongwith documents attached therewith which include papers books 
six in numbers, (pages ranging from 1 to 1586) and the “PLA” filed 
by the “Defendants” (pages ranging from 1 to 139) and nothing 
outside the record, would be taken into consideration while deciding 
the lis in hand. Importantly, this Court will take into consideration its 
earlier judgment passed in “NATIONAL BANK OF PAKISTAN Versus 
KOHINOOR SPINNING MILLS LIMITED etc” (2021 CLD 1112) 
whereby terms ‘default’, ‘fulfilment’ and ‘obligation’ used under 
Section 9 of the “Ordinance” have been interpreted and elaborated 
and the guidelines regarding rescheduling/restructuring of loans 
facilities given by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in “Messrs 
DADABHOY CEMENT INDUSTRIES LTD. and 6 others Versus 
NATIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT 
FINANCE 
CORPORATION, 
KARACHI” (PLD 2002 Supreme Court 500).

4. 
The aforesaid facility had been availed and had continuously 
been renewed/restructured from time to time through various  
sub-facilities. On conversion of the “Proforma Defendants” into the 
“Plaintiff Bank” the “Defendant Company” made requests and 
representations for its renewal/restructure and ultimately the said 
facility including sub-facilities were renewed/restructured through 
execution 
of 
agreements 
dated 15.06.2009 
and 02.11.2010 
respectively. Due to non-fulfilling financial obligations and default in 
repayments under the renewed/restructured finance facilities, the 
“Plaintiff 
Bank” 
claimed 
to 
recover 
an 
amount 
of 
Rs.487,104,728.44/- in respect of following finance facilities with 
breakup as follows:

B. 
LEAVE TO DEFEND 
 
5. 
To refute the claim of the “Plaintiff Bank”, the “Defendant 
Company” filed petition under Section 10 of the “Ordinance” for the 
grant of unconditional leave to defend the suit (“PLA”). The 
“Defendant Company” denied the liabilities alleged by the “Plaintiff 
Bank” by asserting that there were a number of questions of law and 
facts involved which could not be resolved without recording of 
evidence of the “Defendants” and that the “Plaintiff Bank” has failed 
to produce the requisite/mandatory certified statement of accounts.  
 
C. 
SUBMISSIONS OF LEARNED COUNSEL FOR THE 
PLAINTIFF 
 
6. 
Mr. Adil Umar Bandial counsel for the “Plaintiff Bank” inter 
alia stated that the “Defendant Company” approached the “Proforma 

 
Civil Original Suit No.175411 of 2018                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   5 
 
Defendants” in year 2004 seeking grant of finance facility for the 
establishment of a spinning unit at Feroze Wattuwan, District 
Sheikhupura pursuant to Board Resolution dated 19.02.2004 and 
resultantly, a finance facility agreement was executed on markup 
basis on 21.02.2004 for an amount of Rs.199 million which was 
sanctioned and disbursed through letter of disbursement dated 
25.02.2004 after executing Demand Promissory Note, Letter of 
Continuity, Deed of Floating Charge, Letter of Hypothecation, 
Equitable Mortgage, Irrevocable General Power of Attorney, 
affidavits, Directors Guarantee for Mortgage Expenses, Side Letter, 
undertaking 
against 
transfer 
of 
shareholding/management, 
undertaking to advance loan and directors personal guarantee; that on 
“Defendant Company” request through Board Resolution dated 
01.06.2009, the availed subject facility including sub-facilities were 
subsequently 
restructured 
and 
renewed/rescheduled 
through 
agreements dated 15.06.2009 and 02.11.2010 and whereby Term 
Loan Facility, LTF-EOP, Running Finance (RF), Cash Finance (CF) 
and Auto Loan were admitted by the “Defendant Company” but the 
“Defendant Company” in breach of the terms and conditions stated in 
above said agreements failed and/or neglected to repay outstanding 
obligations as and when the same fell due despite various demands 
and reminders; that failure of the “Defendant Company” to repay 
outstanding liabilities since a long period tantamounts to refusal to 
pay the same. It has been further stated that the “Defendants” have 
defaulted and have continued to default on their obligations and as a 
result of the same, a sum of Rs.487,104,728.44/- with mark-up and 
cost of funds is due and payable by them.  
 
D. 
SUBMISSIONS OF LEARNED COUNSEL FOR THE 
DEFENDANTS 
 
7. 
Mr. Muhammad Imran Malik, ASC inter alia submitted that 
suit is liable to be dismissed as the same does not comply with the 
mandatory requirements of Section 9 of the “Ordinance” more 

 
Civil Original Suit No.175411 of 2018                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   6 
 
specifically sub sections (2) and (3) wherein obligations have been 
casted upon a financial institution to file with the plaint all the 
relevant documents as well as to give details regarding the finance 
alleged to have been disbursed, availed and repaid; that the finance 
facilities mentioned in the plaint, were never offered by the “Plaintiff 
Bank” neither availed nor any amount in respect thereof ever 
disbursed to the “Defendant Company”; that the alleged finance 
facilities have not been corroborated with documents and in order to 
conceal the same, the “Plaintiff Bank” has not attached any details or 
documents with respect of such facilities; that it is settled law that any 
suit filed by a financial institution/bank must be supported by a 
properly verified statement of account on oath, whereas the statements 
of accounts filed by the “Plaintiff Bank” are not duly verified on oath 
and they failed to fulfill other requirements of the Bankers Books 
Evidence Act, 1981 as well, which is a mandatory requirements in 
terms of Section 9 of the “Ordinance”, thus no presumption of truth 
can be attached to the same, and in view of such glaring defect in the 
Statement of Account, the suit of the “Plaintiff Bank” is liable to be 
dismissed; that no amount is due and payable by the “Defendant 
Company” to the “Plaintiff Bank” with regard to any finance facility 
and no document affixing any liability upon the “Defendant 
Company” has been appended with the plaint as well as no 
relationship of banker and customer exists between the parties; that 
the “Plaintiff Bank” has charged illegal amounts coupled with 
markup and has illegally made adjustment/deduction through fake 
entries without providing any details thereof; that suit has neither been 
filed by the “Plaintiff Bank” through its competent or authorized 
officer nor any valid document to that effect has been filed with the 
plaint rather it was filed by one Tanveer Ahmed who does not hold a 
valid and legal power of attorney/authorization therefore, the suit is 
liable to be dismissed on this ground alone. Lastly, learned counsel 
urged that in view of his arguments; instant suit may be dismissed

being misconceived or the “Defendants” may be granted 
unconditional leave to appear and defend the suit.  
 
E. 
REPLY 
BY 
LEARNED 
COUNSEL 
FOR 
THE 
PLAINTIFF  
 
8. 
While exercising the right of rebuttal, Mr. Adil Umar Bandial 
counsel for the “Plaintiff Bank”, reiterated the contents of plaint as 
well as replication to the “PLA” and has urged that the “Defendants” 
have admitted the execution of finance facilities and security 
documents as is evident from the agreement dated 15.06.2009 and it is 
a well settled law that the admitted facts need not to be proved, 
therefore, upon admission of the execution of the finance and security 
documents, the “PLA” cannot be granted on this score alone and the 
same is liable to be dismissed. Learned counsel argued that the 
“Defendants” have concealed and twisted the material facts and have 
failed to prove any element of forged/fake entries without any cogent 
evidence and the “PLA” is hit by the principle of approbation and 
reprobation which is not permissible under the law. That the suit has 
validly been filed through Special Power of Attorney holder, 
authorized through Power of Attorney, placed on file as Annex-D/1 to 
D/2 (Pages 249 to 252 of the plaint); that the “Defendant Company” 
was a private limited company and the “Defendants” were its 
directors, mortgagors and guarantors. Copies of Certificate of 
Incorporation and Form-29 are Annex-F to F/1 (Page 253 to 263); that 
the relationship of the “Defendant Company” and the “Defendants”, 
as of customers started in the year-2004 when they initially availed 
finance facility from the “Plaintiff Bank” and got mortgaged their 
properties which have been renewed/rescheduled from time to time 
and lastly in the year 2009, vide request dated 01.06.2009 for 
rescheduling/renewal of existing finance facilities viz. project 
financing, running finance, cash finance and letter of guarantee etc. 
that the claim of the “Plaintiff Bank” is genuine, supported by the 
documents executed by the “Defendants” and Statement of Accounts 

 
Civil Original Suit No.175411 of 2018

had been duly signed and certified by the competent persons; all the 
entries relating to availing of the finance facility and repayments had 
been duly reflected in the statement of accounts and outstanding 
balance has also been shown in the said statement; lastly he pleaded 
that the suit may be decreed as prayed for in favour of the Plaintiff 
and against the “Defendants” jointly and severally with costs and cost 
of funds till realization of the decretal amount. 
9. 
I have heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the 
parties and perused the record. 
 
F. 
MOOT POINTS  
 
10. 
Before proceeding further, it would be advantageous to frame 
the following moot questions: 
 
1.  
Whether the finance facility was availed by the 
“Defendant Company”? 
2.  
Whether 
the 
“Plaintiff 
Bank” 
and 
the 
“Defendant Company” has relationship as a financial 
institution and a customer? 
3.  
Whether the “Plaintiff Bank” is illegally 
claiming an amount of the Running Finance Facility? 
4.  
Whether the Plaintiff Bank is illegally claiming 
an amount of the Cash Finance Facility? 
5.  
Whether the Plaintiff Bank is illegally claiming 
an amount of LTF-EOP? 
6.  
Whether the Defendant Company is liable to 
make payment of the Auto Loan? 
7.  
Whether the suit has been filed by an 
unauthorized person? 
 
Moot Point No.1 
 
Whether the finance facility was availed by the 
“Defendant Company”? 
 
11. 
The counsel for the “Defendant Company” argued that this 
finance facility was neither availed nor the amount claimed by the 
“Plaintiff Bank” was proved to be disbursed and that too no letter of 
credit for the subject facility has been produced by the “Plaintiff 
Bank”. The response of learned counsel for the “Plaintiff Bank” is 

 
Civil Original Suit No.175411 of 2018                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   9 
 
that the said facility was initially availed by the “Defendant 
Company” in year 2004 and the same was subsequently 
restructured/rescheduled through Restructuring Agreement dated 
15.06.2009 and admitted by the “Defendant Company” and that too 
the transaction of letter of credit only mentions to show banker-
customer relationship hence, letter of credit or sanction advices prior 
to 2009 are not legally required.  
11. 
Record reveals that the “Defendant Company” availed the 
subject facility on mark-up basis on 21.02.2004, and subsequently on 
the request of the “Defendant Company” made on 01.06.2009 for 
rescheduling/renewal of existing financing facility (Annex-CV Page 
1140 of Paper Book 5) coupled with Board Resolution (Annex-CV/2 
Page 1141 of 
Paper 
Book 5), the 
subject facility was 
renewed/rescheduled/restructured 
and 
was 
admitted 
by 
the 
“Defendant Company” in Restructuring Agreement, relevant 
acknowledgment and restructuring reads as: 
 
“Acknowledgment 
The Customer hereby acknowledges and confirms that: 
(i) 
the entire Sale Price under each of the Finance 
Agreements has been disbursed to the Customer and the

payable under sub-clause (i) above and the first 
installment shall be payable on December 15, 2018. 
Provided however that if the Customer makes payment

Emphasis supplied 

 
Civil Original Suit No.175411 of 2018                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   11 
 
 
 
  
Plain reading of above makes it quite clear that the “Defendant 
Company”, acknowledged restructuring of three facilities into one 
facility i.e. Term Loan Facility and agreed to pay the entire sale price 
with undertaking to repay outstanding liabilities with markup in the 
manner, mode, and time limit given therein. 
12. 
A bare perusal of above said agreement shows that the 
“Defendant Company” after executing restructuring agreement 
executed an agreement for financing on markup basis on 08.08.2009 
(Page 1166, Paper Book 5) indeed after execution of various 
documents duly signed and executed by the “Defendant Company” 
and the “Defendants” i.e. demand promissory note, letter of 
continuity, confirmation and undertaking, letter of pledge and 
personal guarantees (all dated 08.08.2009) by the “Defendants”, who 
are the signatory of the above said documents which under Section 
118 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, have attached itself the 
presumption of truth vis-a-vis consideration, date, time of acceptance 
and transfer, order of endorsement, stamping and as to holder in due 
course of Negotiable Instrument but the same also attract a special 
rule of evidence as held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
the case of “MUHAMMAD ARSHAD and another Versus CITIBANK 
N.A., LAHORE”(2006 SCMR 1347). Hence stance of the “Defendant 
Company” taken in the “PLA” that subject facility has never been 
availed and also it has raised objections regarding the statement of 
accounts being not in conformity with the requirements of the 
“Ordinance” as well as Bankers' Book Evidence Act, 1891, is not 
sustainable in law because the “Defendant Company” has not filed a 
single document in support of its stance which could show that the 
“Defendants” have ever objected to the entries in the statement of 
accounts and/or raised objections in respect of subject finance 
facilities during the course of business thus, the stance/objection of 
the “Defendant Company” without any proof is nothing but devoid of 

 
Civil Original Suit No.175411 of 2018                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   12 
 
merit. On the contrary, the “Plaintiff Bank” has attached with the 
plaint, all the agreements, security documents, promissory notes etc. 
and statement of account with regard to subject facility showing 
disbursement of amount of Rs.185,969,851/- (Page 1363 of Paper 
Book 6) and the amount of markup Rs.172,373,022.36 (Page 1364, 
Paper Book 6) which substantiates the stance of the “Plaintiff Bank” 
in the subject facility.  
 
Moot Point No.2 
 
Whether the “Plaintiff Bank” and the “Defendant 
Company” has relationship as a financial institution 
and a customer? 
 
13. 
A ground of non-existence of relationship between the parties 
is agitated by learned counsel for the “Defendants” but the said 
ground is not valid in as much as the “Defendants” in their leave to 
defend, at the one hand, have straightaway denied the relationship 
with the “Plaintiff Bank” and execution of documents thereof, but on 
the other hand, they have disputed certain entries of the statement of 
accounts with regard to finance facilities viz. Term Loan Facility, 
Running Finance Facility, Cash Finance Facility, LTF-EOP, and Auto 
Loan availed by them after execution of documents etc.  
14. 
It would be noteworthy to observe that renewal/restructuring 
of finance facilities and execution of agreements and other documents 
in respect thereof, have also been admitted by the “Defendant 
Company” in agreements dated 15.06.2009 and 02.11.2010. The only 
thing by way of defence that was brought forward was that the 
“Plaintiff Bank” is not entitled to capitalize on mark-up and that the 
“Plaintiff Bank” has raised nothing but amounts towards excess 
mark-up and excess deductions. 
15. 
It is observed that availing of Term Loan Facility was admitted 
by the “Defendant Company” in Restructuring Agreement dated 
15.06.2009, relevant portion thereof was reproduced above.  

 
Civil Original Suit No.175411 of 2018                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   13 
 
16. 
Similarly, renewal/restructuring/rescheduling of 
Running 
Finance, Cash Finance, LTE-EOP and Auto Loan facilities were 
admitted by the “Defendant Company” in Clause-19 of Agreement 
for Financing on Mark-up basis dated 02.11.2010 which reads that 
“the terms and conditions contained in the Facility Offer Letter dated 
02.11.2010 form an integral part of this Agreement. However, if there 
is any conflict between the terms of the Facility Offer Letter and this 
Agreement, the terms contained in this Agreement shall prevail”.  
17. 
Hence, in view of the above, relationship between the 
“Plaintiff Bank” and the “Defendant Company” is proved as of a 
financial institution and a customer in terms of Section 2(a) & 2(c) of 
the “Ordinance”; the course of their relationship was regulated based 
on the facility of finances availed by the “Defendant Company”; and 
extended/rescheduled/restructured by the “Plaintiff Bank” thus 
squarely comes within the purview of definition provided under 
Section 2(d) of the “Ordinance”.  
 
Moot Point No.3 
 
Whether the “Plaintiff Bank” is illegally claiming an 
amount of the Running Finance Facility? 
 
18. 
It is argued by learned counsel for the “Defendants” that the 
“Defendant Company” is not liable to make payment of 
Rs.84,473,580.73 as claimed by the “Plaintiff Bank” under the said 
facility as neither independent statement of account relating to this 
facility is brought on record nor the said facility is availed by the 
“Defendant Company”. While using the right of rebuttal, learned 
counsel for the “Plaintiff Bank” stated that Pledge Finance Facility 
and RF Facility were restructured and clubbed together into one 
Facility having sub limits of advances in current account to the 
amount of Rs.55,000,000/- and same was admitted by the “Defendant 
Company” in agreement for financing on mark-up basis dated 
02.11.2010. He further stated that under the applicable banking laws, 
it is a common practice to consider current account statement as RF 

 
Civil Original Suit No.175411 of 2018                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   14 
 
statement of account was debited to settle the liability of Cash Credit 
Pledge/Cash Finance account statement and more so the “Defendant 
Company” has never raised such objection during continuance of 
banker-customer relationship. It is observed that the “Defendant 
Company” in “PLA” has admitted the subject facility in ground (m) 
by stating the amount due on 01.08.2009 as Rs.54,617,439.23 and the 
amounts availed which is also evident from facility letter dated 
02.11.2010 which reads as:

mentioned the amounts due and availed after 01.08.2009 whereas they 
have not mentioned the amounts availed since initiation of availing 
the said facility. On the contrary, the “Plaintiff Bank” has annexed 
the statement of accounts of the subject facility (Pages 1365 to 1524 
of Paper Book 6) showing debit and credit entries till 05.04.2012. 
 
Moot Point No.4 
 
Whether the Plaintiff Bank is illegally claiming 
an amount of the Cash Finance Facility? 
 
20. 
The counsel for the “Defendants” argued that the “Defendant 
Company” is not liable to make payment of Rs.14,134,195.18 as 
claimed by the “Plaintiff Bank” because this facility was not availed 
by the “Defendant Company”. The response of learned counsel for 
the “Plaintiff Bank” is that the “Defendant Company” availed total 
amount of Rs.13,69,684,374/- under this facility since year 2004 to 
2010 and the same is reflected in the statement of account at pages 
1528 to 1551 while an amount of Rs.13,64,679,319.35 has been 
repaid therefore, an amount of Rs.5,00,054.65 is outstanding. It is 
observed that the “Defendant Company” in “PLA” has admitted the 
subject facility in ground (I) by stating an amount of Rs.87,97,500.00 
on 27.01.2010 and the amounts repaid from 12.02.2010 10.07.2014 
but perusal of record reveals that this facility was availed by the 
“Defendant Company” in year 2004 and the same was restructured 
subsequently and lastly it was restructured through agreement of 
finance on markup basis dated 02.11.2010 for an amount of Rs.200 
million as is evident from facility letter dated 02.11.2010 which reads

It is noted that the “Defendant Company” has mentioned the

they have not mentioned the amounts availed since initiation of 
availing the said facility. The “Plaintiff Bank” has annexed the 
statement of accounts of the subject facility (Pages 1528 to 1551 of 
Paper Book 6) showing debit and credit entries till 10.07.2014 which 
shows that an amount of Rs.5,005,054.65 is outstanding against the

Whether the Plaintiff Bank is illegally claiming an

The counsel for the “Defendant Company” argued that the 
“Plaintiff Bank” is illegally claiming an amount of 87,992,026.00 
under this facility while neither from record the availing and 
sanctioning of said amount in favour of the “Defendant Company” is 
proved nor statement of account corroborates the same. He also stated 
that the “Plaintiff Bank” has deducted an excess amount of 
Rs.27,590,945.00. While the response of learned counsel for the 
“Plaintiff Bank” is that the “Defendant Company” initially availed 
two facilities, first was for an amount of Rs.47,193,942/- and second 
was for an amount Rs.40,798,084/- and accumulated amounts of both 
comes to Rs.87,992,026/-. He pointed out that after making certain 
repayments by the “Defendant Company”, an amount of 
Rs.29,559,870.78 as principal and markup is still outstanding and 
statement of accounts attached with the plaint substantiated the same. 
It is observed that the “Defendant Company” in “PLA” has admitted 
the subject facility in ground (c) by stating an amount of 
Rs.47,193,942.00 and amounts of repayment from 27.02.2007 to 
05.07.2011. This facility was also restructured one and admitted 
through agreement for finance on mark-up basis dated 02.11.2010 by 
admitting the liability in the following manner.

It is noted that statement of account of EOP-I facility is 
available at page 1559 of Paper Book 6, according to which, an 
amount of Rs.40,798,084.00 was disbursed in favour of the 
“Defendant Company” out of which amounts of Rs.1,854,458.00 
were repaid on 27.02.2007, 28.05.2007, 29.08.2007, 27.11.2007, 
01.03.2008, 26.05.2008, 27.08.2008, 28.11.2008. Whereas with 
regard to EOP-II, an amount of Rs.47,193,942.00 was disbursed as 
reflected in statement of account, page 1561 of Paper Book 6, 
according to which an amount of 1,887,758.00 was repaid by the

05.07.2011 (total repayment Rs.26,428,612.00) while an amount of 
Rs.20,765,330.00 has been shown as outstanding. It is observed that 
the “Defendant Company” in the “PLA” Ground 2(c) has mentioned 
certain entries with different dates by mingling the dates and amounts 
of two facilities under one facility. In this view of the matter, the 
ground of deducting excess amount agitated by learned counsel for 
the “Defendant Company” is without any supporting documents thus 
carries no weight. 
 
Moot Point No.6 
 
Whether the Defendant Company is liable to make 
payment of the Auto Loan? 
 
24. 
The stance of learned counsel for the “Defendant Company” is 
that determination of payment of the subject facility has already been 
decided by the Banking Court, Lahore vide judgment dated 
08.07.2014 and the “Defendant Company” has already deposited an 
amount of Rs.530,208.39. While learned counsel for the “Plaintiff 
Bank” stated that the aforesaid judgment and decree has been set-
aside by learned Division Bench of this Court in R.F.A.No.1099 of 
2014 vide order dated 04.02.2016 by remanding the matter to the 
Banking Court concerned pursuant to which the Banking Court 
dismissed the suit vide judgment dated 26.03.2016. This facility was 
also admitted by the “Defendant Company” through agreement for 
finance on mark-up basis dated 02.11.2010 in the following manner:

A thorough glance of the “PLA” reveals that the “Defendants”, 
though have mentioned the judgment dated 08.07.2014 whereby the 
Banking Court determined the outstanding liability under the subject 
facility and making the payment in compliance thereof, yet, they 
have annexed the order dated 26.03.2016 (page 136 of the “PLA”), 
passed pursuant to directions issued in R.F.A.No.1099 of 2014 on 
04.02.2016. The relevant portion is reproduced hereunder: 
 
“7. 
It is not disputed fact by the parties that plaintiff 
is still defaulter in payment of finance facility availed 
and subject matter of this case as well as the other 
facilities availed by it. Even it has not fully paid all 
outstanding dues against the vehicles in question as is 
evident from statement of account, according to which 
outstanding liability of the plaintiff on account of 
principal is Rs.106,684/- and markup is Rs.10,811.87 
total amounting to Rs.117,495.87 pertaining to Vehicle 
Honda City, and outstanding liability of the plaintiff 
against vehicle Honda Accord, on account of principal 
is 368,348/- and markup is Rs.44,364.52 total 
amounting to Rs.412,715.52 and total liability of both 
the vehicles becomes Rs.530,208.39. The plaintiff was 
asked to pay this outstanding liability by this court on 
08.07.2014 and it has not assailed that order meaning 
that he admits above stated liabilities.” 
 
26. 
From above observation, it is quite obvious that the subject 
facility has been admitted by the “Defendant Company”; the same is 
also reflected from the statement of accounts (pages 1570 and 1571, 
Paper Book 6); and no document in this respect has been brought on 
record. While the “Plaintiff Bank” has claimed the same amount 

 
Civil Original Suit No.175411 of 2018                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   21 
 
through the suit in hand hence the stance of the “Defendant 
Company” does not carry weight. 
 
Moot Point No.7 
 
Whether the suit has been filed by an unauthorized 
person? 
 
27. 
So far as the objection of the “Defendants” with regard to 
institution of present suit by an unauthorized/incompetent person, is 
concerned, this objection has properly been dealt with by this Court in 
the case of “The BANK OF PUNJAB Versus Messrs MAGIC RIVER 
SERVICES and 4 others”(2016 CLD 171) by observing that “Section 
9 of the Ordinance empowers three categories of persons to file a suit 
(a) the brank manager (b) an officer authorized by a power of 
attorney and (c) an officer who is otherwise authorized by a financial 
institution”. Record reveals that the suit in hand was instituted by 
Tanveer Ahmad, Attorney Holder, Assets Rehabilitation Group, MCB 
Bank Limited, MCB, House, Jail Road, Lahore. The said attorney 
holder was authorized through Special Power of Attorney executed in 
his favour on 15.08.2017 by the President and Chief Executive of the 
“Plaintiff Bank” to institute the suit. The Chairman of the Board of 
Directors of the “Plaintiff Bank” appointed Mr. Imran Maqbool son of 
Malik Maqbool Ahmed, as general power of attorney authorizing him 
to further delegate his powers authorizing him certain powers 
including the powers to take all requisite steps/actions in relation to 
the legal proceedings of the “Plaintiff Bank” as per clauses 31 and 32 
which read as under: 
 
“31. To appoint at any time or from time to 
time any executive(s), officer(s) or any other 
person(s) to be the Attorney of the Bank for 
managing the affairs of the Bank and/or 
conducting the business of the Bank with such 
powers as deemed appropriate by the Authority.  
32. 
To appoint any substitute or substitutes 
and delegate to such substitute or substitutes all 
or any of the powers hereby conferred, provided 

 
Civil Original Suit No.175411 of 2018                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   22 
 
that no such appointment(s) shall divest the 
Attorney himself of any of the powers hereby 
granted and provided further that the power to 
appoint 
substitutes 
provided 
for 
in 
this 
paragraph shall not be conferred on any 
substitute.” 
 
28. 
In view of above, it is held that the present suit has been 
instituted by the competent person having requisite authority from the 
President/CEO of the “Plaintiff Bank” under special power of 
attorney, hence this objection is rejected. 
 
 
  
DETERMINATION BY THE COURT  
 
29. 
There is no cavil to the proposition that Section 9 of the 
“Ordinance” is invoked for non-fulfillment of the obligation with 
regard to finance by or against any financial institution and the parties 
to a suit are obligated to specifically mention/plead in the plaint and in 
the “PLA”, the amount of finances availed by a defendant from the 
financial institution, the amount paid by a defendant to the financial 
institution and dates of repayment as well as the amount of finance 
and other amounts relating to the finance facility payable by a 
defendant to a financial institution up to the date of institution of suit 
for recovery, thus under Sections 9(3) and 10(4) of the “Ordinance”, 
the “Plaintiff Bank” and the “Defendant” have identical statutory 
responsibilities as held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
“APOLLO TEXTILE MILLS LTD. and others Versus SONERI BANK 
LTD.”(PLD 2012 SC 268). 
30. 
The terms ‘default’, ‘fulfilment’ and ‘obligation’ used under 
Section 9 of the “Ordinance” has already been interpreted by this 
Court in the case of “NATIONAL BANK OF PAKISTAN” (2021 CLD 
1112) by holding as under: 
 
“By examining the language and words of 
Section 9(1) of the Ordinance and the words used 
therein which have been explained above, it is 
unequivocal that the Plaintiff Bank filed the suit 
for recovery of loan, which was based on the 

 
Civil Original Suit No.175411 of 2018                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   23 
 
statements of accounts attached with the plaint 
and duly certified under the Bankers' Books 
Evidence Act, 1891 and the same was not 
rebutted by the Defendants with cogent reasons 
either 
through 
oral 
evidence 
or 
through 
documentary evidence. The Defendant Company 
has not denied availing of finance facilities nor 
has denied the documentation hence admitted the 
availing of finance facilities and its documents. 
The Plaintiff Bank however alleged that the 
Defendants have committed default in repayment 
thereof. Though the term willful default is defined 
under Section 2(g) of the Ordinance, which 
means deliberate and intentional failure of the 
customer to repay financial assistance secured 
from a financial institution yet the requirement 
under Section 9 is default simpliciter, which is 
not defined in the Ordinance, however, through 
the aid of literal interpretation referred above 
and analogy drawn from the definition of willful 
default under the Ordinance, a default means 
failure to fulfill the conditions of a contract to 
pay the loan, either whole or installments and 
includes an unfulfilled obligation. The existence 
of relationship between the parties and availing 
of finance facility by the Defendants from the 
Plaintiff Bank is well established through 
documentary evidence and the defendants failed 
to establish that they did not have committed any 
default in fulfillment of their financial obligation 
towards the Plaintiff Bank. The Plaintiff bank, as 
such, has established that the Defendants have 
committed 
default 
in 
fulfillment 
of 
their 
obligation regarding the finance facility availed 
by them”. 
 
31. 
It may be noted that renewal, rescheduling, restructuring of a 
finance facility only ensued upon default, non-payment, delayed 
payment or inability in payment of outstanding liability by a customer 
who normally sought such concession upon admission of his liability 
and in the case in hand, the previous finance facilities availed by the 
“Defendant Company” were finally restructured/renewed due to 
inability to pay the liability owing to economic conditions prevailing 
in the country as is evident from request made on 01.06.2009 (Page 
1140 Paper Book 5). The learned Division Bench of this Court in 
“Syed ABBAS ALI Versus BANK OF PUNJAB through Manager 

 
Civil Original Suit No.175411 of 2018                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   24 
 
and others” (2015 CLD 1409) has observed that “restructuring or 
renewal was also a facility or accommodation granted by the bank to 
a customer and was therefore to be recognized as an "obligation" 
within the meaning of S. 2(e) of the Financial Institutions (Recovery 
of Finances) Ordinance, 2001”. It has further been observed that 
“financial institutions in case of restructuring or rescheduling of 
previous finance, were not obliged to bring on record statements of 
accounts prior to the agreement through which restructuring had 
been made; as such was an admitted amount duly acknowledged by 
the customer and no disbursement of amount was involved in the 
matter as the case being that of restructuring and not that of fresh 
finance”. 
32. 
It is also apparent on the record that the “Defendant 
Company” not only availed finance facility from the “Plaintiff Bank” 
rather the facilities were subjected to renewal many a times. This 
Court in “SYED ABBAS ALI Versus BANK OF PUNJAB THROUGH 
MANAGER and others” (2015 CLD 1409) recognized restructuring 
or renewal of loan in favor of customer by a financial institution as 
facility comes within the purview of obligation as defined under 
Section 2(e) of the Ordinance. The Court held that “by approving 
rescheduling /restructuring/renewal of the finance facility the bank 
foregoes its immediate right of recovery and enforcement of securities 
against the customer which is absorbed through mutual agreed 
interest or mark-up charges till the agreed date of liquidation. Thus, 
restructuring or renewal is also a facility or accommodation granted 
by the bank to a customer. This facility has been recognized as an 
"obligation" as defined in section 2(e) of the Financial Institutions 
(Recovery of Finances) Ordinance, 2001.” Furthermore, the 
performance of any undertaking and fulfilment of a promise relating 
to repayment of finance is also an obligation within the meaning of 
the Ordinance as was held in “NIB BANK LIMITED Versus Mirza 
GHULAM MUJTABA” (2015 CLD 1547). In the said judgment, it 
was further held that “Moreover, inter alia performance of an 

 
Civil Original Suit No.175411 of 2018                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   25 
 
undertaking or fulfillment of a promise relating to repayment of 
finance or payment of any other amounts regarding finance is an 
obligation in terms of section 2[c] of F.I.O., 2001.”Similarly, in 
“NATIONAL BANK OF PAKISTAN Versus NAJMA SUGAR MILLS 
LIMITED”(2015 CLD 1990), the Court also recognized that 
performance of undertakings and promises by a customer with 
Financial Institutions forms part of ‘obligation’ under the Ordinance. 
33. 
The issue with regard to restructuring of loan and finance 
facilities has also already been dealt with by the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in “Messrs DADABHOY CEMENT INDUSTRIES 
LTD. and 6 others Versus NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT FINANCE 
CORPORATION, KARACHI”(PLD 2002 Supreme Court 500) by 
holding that 
"  The argument that the respondent by adding 
further interest/markup on the amount on which 
interest / markup had already been paid, played 
fraud, has no substance, for, this fact was 
already in the knowledge of the petitioners and 
they had agreed to pay the same on 
rescheduling of the outstanding amount, which 
has been admitted by the petitioners in their 
Suit No.416 of 1996, as such, they being privy 
to the rescheduling of the loan, can not turn 
around to say that further markup was 
fraudulently charged.........." 
 
34. 
A careful scanning of the record further establishes that the 
“Defendants” have failed to substantiate their stance taken in the 
“PLA” as they did not file necessary documents which in their 
opinion supported the substantial questions of law and fact as 
required under Section 10(9) of the “Ordinance”. Also, the 
“Defendants” did not comply with the mandatory requirements of 
10(5) of the “Ordinance”, and were bound to face consequences for 

 
Civil Original Suit No.175411 of 2018                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   26 
 
such non-compliance because as per section 10(6) of the 
“Ordinance”, application for the grant of leave, which does not 
comply with the requirements of subsections (3), (4) and (5) of 
Section 10 of Ordinance, shall be rejected, unless the “Defendants” 
disclose any sufficient cause for their inability to comply with any 
such requirement. The provisions of Section 10(5) of “Ordinance” 
are mandatory in nature, as the non-compliance of the said provisions 
of law entail the penal consequences, as provided under section 10(6) 
of the “Ordinance”. Further, execution of documents filed with 
plaint is not denied by the “Defendants” in the “PLA” and thus are 
not entitled for leave to defend in the instant suit. Since the 
“Defendants” have not discharged their obligations as per the 
agreements, referred to above, the present suit has rightly been 
instituted by the “Plaintiff Bank”. It is a trite proposition of law that 
where the Defendant has not complied with the mandatory 
requirement of law, the Plaintiff is entitled to have the suit decreed in 
his favour as mandated under Section 10(12) of the “Ordinance”. 
Further, upon examination of the documents placed on record, I am 
of considered view that the defence set up in defendants’ application 
for leave to defend the instant suit is evasive, improbable and no 
substantial questions of law or facts raised in the leave application 
and as such liable to be rejected. In “Messrs AL-MADAN COAL 
COMPANY 
(PVT.) 
LTD. 
and 
others 
Versus 
REGIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION” (2009 CLD 645) in 
a similar situation, the august Supreme Court of Pakistan has 
upheld the decision of the court of first instance by holding that 
“both the learned Courts after attending to all the crucial aspects of 
the case, adhering to the contentions raised by the petitioners and 
upon examination of the documents placed on record legally came to 
the conclusion that the defence set up in petitioners application for 
leave to defend the suit was evasive, improbable and no substantial 
questions of law or facts were raised in the leave application and 
rightly rejected the same. We are not persuaded to reverse the 

 
Civil Original Suit No.175411 of 2018                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   27 
 
findings of two Courts which are apt to facts of the case and law on 
the subject.” 
35. 
The upshot of above discussion is that the “Defendants” have 
failed to establish any ground for grant of leave to defend. Hence 
their PLA No.205720 of 2018 is rejected under Section 10 of the 
“Ordinance”. Consequently, it is held that the “Plaintiff Bank” has 
appended with the plaint all the relevant documents as per the 
requirement of Section 9 of the Ordinance and has fully proved its 
case as well as the commission of willful default by the 
“Defendants” keeping in view the principles for grant of leave to 
defend enunciated in detail by this Court in “NATIONAL BANK OF 
PAKISTAN Versus KOHINOOR SPINNING MILLS LIMITED etc” 
(2021 
CLD 
1112) 
and 
the 
guidelines 
regarding 
rescheduling/restructuring of loans facilities given by the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in “Messrs DADABHOY CEMENT 
INDUSTRIES 
LTD. 
and 
6 
others 
Versus 
NATIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION, KARACHI” (PLD 
2002 Supreme Court 500). Reliance is also placed on recent 
judgment cited in “MUSLIM COMMERCIAL BANK LIMITED 
Versus CITY STEEL INDUSTRIES LAHORE through Partners and 
others” (2023 CLD 235). After having minute examination of the 
record, framing of moot points emerging from the pleadings and the 
arguments of learned counsel for the parties and while considering all 
the grounds taken by the Defendants in the “PLA”, and also 
appreciating the contents of plaint under Section 9 of the Ordinance, 
application for grant of loan facility, facility offer letter, agreement 
for finance, demand promissory note, letter of authority, guarantees, 
statement of finance account and statement of markup account and 
other relevant documents, this Court forthwith proceed to pass the 
decree for a sum of Rs.487,104,728.44 (inclusive of markup) in 
favour of the “Plaintiff Bank” and against the “Defendants” jointly 
and severally, with costs of funds as contemplated under Section 3 of 

 
Civil Original Suit No.175411 of 2018                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   28 
 
the “Ordinance” in the terms mentioned supra. Decree sheet be 
drawn up accordingly.
