JUDGMENT 
Date of hearing 
 
08.11.2023  
 
Appellants by 
 
Mr. Hasan Irfan Khan, Mr. Saqib 
Asghar, Mr. Mudassar Hassan and 
Ms. Mahnoor, learned Advocates. 
Respondent No. 
1 by 
Syed Salman Ali Mohsin, Advocate. 
 
SULTAN TANVIR AHMAD, J:–This appeal, under section 
114 of Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 (the ‘Ordinance’), is 
directed against order dated 28.01.2020 passed under Order 
XXXIX, Rule 1 & 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (the 
‘Code’) by learned Presiding Officer, Intellectual Property 
Tribunal, Lahore (the ‘Tribunal’). 
2.  
Respondent No. 1 instituted suit before the learned 
Tribunal with the averments that she is a bona fide owner, prior 
adopter and user of trade mark(s) ‘SAMSARA’ or ‘SAMSARA 
by Khadija  Batool’. She has further claimed in the suit that 
registration of ‘SAMSARA Couture House (Pvt.) Limited’ with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan by the 
appellants and use of mark ‘SAMSARA’ amounts to 
infringement of her rights. This suit is being contested by the 

 
FAO No. 7892 of 2020 
 
 
2 
appellants, raising various objections including that the claim of 
prior user is false; that respondent No. 1 soon after her 
graduation in fashion designing entered into partnership 
agreement dated 03.03.2016 (‘the partnership agreement’) 
with appellant No. 2 who is having vast experience in textile 
industry. It is claimed in the written statement that 
‘SAMSARA’ is owned by the partnership as evident from the 
recital and clauses of the partnership agreement. The prior or 
bona fide usage of the ‘SAMSARA’ by respondent No. 1 is 
denied in the written statement. 
3. 
On 28.01.2020 the learned Tribunal allowed the 
application instituted under Order XXXIX, Rule 1 & 2 of the 
Code and the appellants have been restrained from using 
‘SAMSARA’ or ‘SAMSARA by Khadija Batool’ and name 
‘SAMSARA Couture House (Private) limited’. Aggrieved from 
the same the present appeal has been filed.  
4. 
It is admitted before me that the mark in question 
is not yet registered, with the trade mark registry, in the name 
of any of the parties to the suit. Appellant No. 2 filed 
application for registration of the disputed mark on 27.09.2017 
and soon thereafter i.e. on 10.10.2017 respondent No. 1 also 
filed an application for registration of the mark in relevant 
classes. The claim of respondent No. 1 is essentially based on 
prior use of ‘SAMSARA’, being its alleged creator and goodwill 
acquired through prior usage. In the cases of unregistered trade-
marks, which are filed on the basis of prior use or goodwill 
acquired through such usage, at the interim stage, it is 
commonly important for the Courts to tentatively assess sales 
invoices, advertisements in print and electronic media as well 
as promotion through other tangible means, receipts, returns 
showing trade with the given name as well as other relevant 
documentary evidence filed by the two sides. Reference        

 
FAO No. 7892 of 2020

can be made to cases titled “Messrs Unique School vs. Messrs 
Unique Group of Institutions”(2015 CLD 1297), “Pioneer 
Cement Limited through Company Secretary vs. Fecto Cement 
Limited through Chief Executive Officer and 3 others”(2013 
CLD 201) and “Qadeer Ahmed vs. The Assistant Registrar of 
Trade Marks, The Trade Marks Registry and another”(1999 
YLR 96). 
5. 
It is settled that interim injunction, by its nature is 
a preventive relief preserving the status quo of the subject 
matter till the final conclusion of the suit. After ascertaining 
prima facie case, by assessing aforesaid documents if available, 
the Courts must see the existence of the remaining two factors 
of balance of convenience and irreparable loss or injury. The 
preventive relief, in such circumstances and in the cases of 
unregistered marks, should not be granted as a matter of course 
and it is suitable when existence of right by prior use or its 
creation as well as its infringement are demonstrated with some 
clarity. Here it will be beneficial to reproduce paragraph No. 9 
of judgment in case titled “Muhammad Kashan vs. Coca Cola 
Export Corporation through Chief Executive Officer and 3 
others”(2015 CLD 1513), which reads as under:-. 
“…Principles relating to the law of interim 
injunction are more or less well-settled. Interim 
injunction, by its nature, is a preventive remedy 
for the purpose of preserving the status quo of 
the matter of the suit pending the determination 
of suit. It is a discretionary relief and the 
Courts while considering the question of grant 
of such relief, have to see the co-existence of 
prima facie case, balance of convenience and 
irreparable loss and injury in favour of a party 
seeking such relief. Moreover, the existence of a 
right and its infringement are the first 
conditions for grant of interim injunction. 
Therefore, when action is brought before the 
Court by the plaintiff to prevent infringement of 
copyright, the Court would grant an interim 
injunction only when the right claimed by the 
plaintiff is clear. It cannot be granted as a 

 
FAO No. 7892 of 2020 
 
 
4 
matter of course in those cases where even to 
establish prima facie case evidence has to be 
produced. In the case in hand, as mentioned in 
para No.8 supra, the appellant/plaintiff has 
failed to make out prima facie case on the 
ground of infringement of a "work" under the 
1962 Ordinance and for this reason no 
discretion can be exercised in favor of appellant 
for grant of interim injunctive relief…” 
 
6. 
In the present case respondent No. 1 relied on 
documents attached with the plaint as Annexures A/1 to A/20. 
These attachments, besides one document, comprises of 
invoices reflecting purchase of raw material of fashion apparel 
for meager amounts and pages from facebook of respondent 
No. 1 herself. These documents are required to be assessed in 
trial to see their veracity. On the other hand the partnership 
agreement is not denied by the parties. This admitted document 
shows that the parties agreed to carry business in the name and 
style of ‘SAMSARA’ by Khadija Batool. Respondent No. 1 and 
appellant No. 2 as per clause 6 of the partnership agreement are 
equal shareholders in profit and loss. This written document, 
signed by two sides, is totally silent as to prior use of 
‘SAMSARA’ by respondent No. 1 or for that matter even by 
appellant No. 2. 
7. 
Syed Salman Ali Mohsin, learned counsel for 
respondent No. 1 has not given any reasonable explanation as to 
another suit instituted on behalf of respondent No. 1, wherein, 
the learned Civil Court restrained the parties from violation of 
the terms of the partnership agreement vide order dated 
27.11.2018. Reference by Mr. Hasan Irfan Khan, learned ASC 
to the case titled “Yaqoob vs. Additional Settlement 
Commissioner, Karachi and 2 others” (1973 SCMR 116) and 
“Kohinoor Soap and Detergents (Private) Ltd through Chief 
Executive of the Company vs. Basra Soap Factory and 4 
others” (2002 CLD 1223, Karachi) as well as provisions of 

 
FAO No. 7892 of 2020 
 
 
5 
Partnership Act, 1932, is not irrelevant, either. However, 
addressing these arguments in detail, at this stage, is not 
required. 
8. 
Keeping in view the peculiar facts of the case, I am 
of the opinion that three ingredients required for grant of 
interim injunction are not co-existing in the present case. 
Consequently, order dated 28.01.2020 passed by the learned 
Tribunal is set-aside and this appeal is allowed. The suit is 
pending for about five years, therefore, the learned Tribunal is 
directed to decide the same at earliest and preferably within five 
months from the date of receipt of certified copy of this 
judgment.  
9. 
Before parting with this judgment I would like to 
clarify that the observations made above are tentative and the 
learned Tribunal shall decide the main case without being 
prejudiced from any discussion made above.
