(I) 
BRIEF BACKGROUND 
2. 
 
Khalid Mehmood/the Respondent No.1 joined Government 
Service in 1968 and after having been promoted as Secretary to the 
Government of Pakistan (BS-22) vide Notification dated 18.10.2001, issued 
by the Cabinet Secretariat, Establishment Division, Islamabad, was posted as 
Director General, Civil Services Academy and thereafter as the Principal, 
Pakistan Administrative Staff College, Lahore, vide Notification dated 
08.08.2003, issued by the same aforesaid Authority. Later on, his services 
were placed at the disposal of the Government of the Punjab, vide Notification 

I.C.A.No.431 of 2016 
 
           2 
dated 10.12.2004 and on deputation he was appointed as Chairman of the 
Punjab Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority (TEVTA) by 
Government of the Punjab. He was retired on 31.08.2005, however, continued 
his services as Chairman TEVTA on contract basis. On issuance of letter 
dated 20.07.2006, by the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister mentioning 
that the Prime Minister had approved a Residential Plot on payment in 
addition to the plot being given on turn through the FGEH Scheme, when 
available, the Respondent No.1 applied but the same was refused vide letter 
dated 14.11.2007, issued by the Section Officer (E-I), Government of 
Pakistan, Cabinet Secretariat, Establishment Division, Islamabad. 
 
(II) 
CONTENTIONS-ARGUMENTS OF LEARNED COUNSEL FOR 
 
 
THE  APPELLANT/ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL. 
 
3. 
 
It is contended by the leaned Law Officer that the Respondent 
No.1 applied for an additional plot on the ground of claiming himself to be a 
Federal Secretary which he wasn’t, as he did not fulfill the condition of 
posting as Federal Secretary during the initial criteria approved by the Prime 
Minister, which remained operative from 02.08.2006 to 02.01.2007 and later 
on that was substituted by a modified criteria remained operative from 
03.01.2007, which makes the contract employees ineligible for allotment of an 
additional plot, as sought for, by the Respondent No.1. In addition to this, the 
claim of the Respondent No.1 was also against the norms settled by the Rules 
of Business, 1973, which defines a post of ‘Secretary’ as under:- 
 
“2(xviii) 
“Secretary” means the [Secretary 
General], [Principal Secretary], Secretary or Acting 
Secretary to the Government of Pakistan in charge 
of a Division or a Ministry, and where there is no 
Secretary, the Additional Secretary or Joint 
Secretary in charge of the Division or the Ministry.” 
4. 
 
It is further contended by the learned Law Officer that according to 
the approved Package by the Prime Minister a Federal Secretary should have 
completed at least one year ‘in an office’ as a Federal Secretary/Special 
Secretary/Secretary General and that the period of re-employment as a Federal 

I.C.A.No.431 of 2016 
 
           3 
Secretary/Special Secretary/Secretary General will be counted towards the 
eligibility tenure of one year. Adds that criteria for allotment of a plot to the 
Federal Secretaries was further revised in 2007 by the Prime Minister’s 
Secretariat according to clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of which all BS-22 serving 
officers of the regularly constituted groups shall be eligible for allotment of a 
residential plot provided that the allotment shall be made when the remaining 
service of the officer does not exceed two years; Officers serving on 
contract/secondment from the armed forces shall not be eligible and officers 
serving as contract employees or on MP Scales shall not be eligible.  Further 
adds that, at the time of initial criteria, the Respondent No.1 was not an 
employee of the Federal Government and thus not posted as a Federal 
Secretary and after having been re-employed after his superannuation he had 
rightly been excluded from eligibility in terms of letter dated 01.08.2006. 
Regarding stance of the Respondent No.1 qua discrimination he elucidates 
that four officers namely Syed Tariq Ali Bokhari, M/S Nawid Ahsan, Vakil 
Ahmad Khan and Tariq Aziz had been allotted plots, as amongst the said ones 
first three remained posted as Federal Secretary while the fourth one as 
Principal Secretary/Secretary General entitling them all four for allotment of 
an additional plot to each one. Therefore, no discrimination was done with the 
Respondent No.1, as his case was entirely different than that of said four 
officers. Places reliance on Maqsood Ahmad Toor and 4 others versus 
Federation of Pakistan Ministry of housing and Works, Islamabad and 
others (2000 SCMR 928). Lastly, prays for setting aside of judgment dated 
03.03.2016 on the above taken grounds. 
 
(III) CONTENTIONS OF LEARNED COUNSEL FOR  
 
 
 
RESPONDENTS NO.1. 
 
5. 
 
Barrister Munawar-us-Salam, ASC contended that the Respondent 
No.1 joined Government Service in the year 1968 and after having rendered 
unblemished service was promoted vide Notification No. 5/7/93-E.I. 
Government of Pakistan Cabinet Secretariat Establishment Division, 
Islamabad on 18.10.2001 and was posted as Director General, Civil Services 
Academy, Lahore. Thereafter, vide Notification dated 08.08.2003 had been 

I.C.A.No.431 of 2016 
 
           4 
posted Principal, Pakistan Administrative Staff College, Lahore and thereafter 
vide Notification dated 10.12.2004 his services were placed at the disposal of 
Government of the Punjab and was posted as Chairman, Punjab Technical 
Education and Vocational Training Authority (TEVTA). He was retired on 
31.08.2005 and remained in service as such on contract basis after his 
retirement. Adds that on approval of a Package by the Prime Minister 
including allotment of an additional plot to the Federal Secretaries, he applied 
for the same facility on account of his case being identical to that of Mr. Tariq 
Aziz, Mr. Nawid Ahsan, Syed Tariq Ali Bukhari and Mr. Vakil Ahmed Khan 
whose dates of retirement were 26.05.2002, 09.04.2004, 04.03.2005 and 
05.06.2005 respectively who had been promoted as Secretaries, Government 
of Pakistan and were also re-employed after their superannuation, as he was. 
And all/each four of them had been allotted an additional plot as per Package 
announced by the Prime Minister but his request was denied by the concerned 
Authority with the observation that he/the Respondent No.1 did not meet the 
condition of posting as Federal Secretary during the currency of the initial 
criteria for a period of one year and that after his superannuation having been 
re-employed on 01.09.2005, he stood excluded from eligibility in terms of 
letter dated 01.08.2006, issued by Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister. 
6. 
The comments submitted on behalf the Respondent No.2 also mentioned 
that no recommendation was made by the Establishment Division for 
allotment of an additional plot to the Respondent No.1 due to which he was 
not allotted the plot under the Prime Minister’s Scheme.  
7. 
    
We have heard learned counsel for the parties and also perused the 
record. 
8. 
   
The main grievance of the Appellant is that while passing the 
impugned Judgment dated 03.03.2016, the learned Single Judge did not take 
into account that the Respondent No.1 had been retired from Government 
service on 01.09.2005 and was re-employed as Chairman, Technical 
Education and Vocational Training Authority (TEVTA) under Government of 
the Punjab and that at the time of initial criteria announced by the Prime 
Minister, the Respondent No.1 had not been an employee of the Federal 

I.C.A.No.431 of 2016 
 
           5 
Government and thus was  not meeting the condition of posting as a Federal 
Secretary during the currency of initial criteria and that even otherwise, after 
having been reemployed after his superannuation with effect from 01.09.2005, 
he had become ineligible for winning an additional plot in terms of above 
referred letter dated 01.08.2006. Moreover it also remained out of 
consideration by the learned Single Judge that case of the Respondent No.1 
was entirely different from that of the four officers namely (1) Syed Tariq Ali 
Bukhari, (2) M/s Vakil Ahmad, (3) Nawid Ahsan and (4)Tariq Aziz, as 
amongst them Nos. 1 to 3 had been posted as Federal Secretaries while the 4th 
one as a Principal Secretary/Secretary General and thus, the Respondent No.1 
was not discriminated in any manner neither this act of the Appellant was 
unconstitutional.  
9. 
 
When we put the said illegalities, as pointed out by the Appellant 
from the impugned judgment, in juxtaposition with the stance, references and 
criteria discussed above holding a Secretary (BS-22) to be entitled to 
allotment of an additional plot, it becomes crystal clear that admittedly the 
Respondent No.1 had been promoted as Secretary to the Government of 
Pakistan, vide Notification dated 18.10.2001 and retired as such on 
01.09.2005, therefore, in this state of affairs, there is no doubt that he did have 
one year service at his credit, as a Secretary. As for holding of an office as a 
Federal Secretary is concerned, it is the prerogative of the Prime Minister that 
he placed services of a Secretary BS-22 where does he want or think 
appropriate; therefore the postings of the Respondent No.1 at different 
Provincial departments cannot snatch the rank and status of a Secretary BS-22 
because of it being awarded to him by Government of Pakistan, Cabinet 
Secretariat, Establishment Division/a Federal department. Rule 4 of the Rules 
of Business, 1973 envisages that each Division shall consist of a Secretary to 
the Government and of such other officials subordinate to him as the 
Government may determine and the Secretary will be the official head of the 
Division. Further regarding question of discrimination alleged by the 
Respondent No.1, while hearing learned Assistant Attorney General, the same 
was confronted to him that amongst the afore-referred Secretaries, Mr. Tariq 

I.C.A.No.431 of 2016 
 
           6 
Aziz was stated to remain posted as Secretary National Security Council and 
retired on 26.05.2002, Mr. Nawid Ahsan remained posted as Secretary 
General Finance and retired on 09.04.2004 while Syed Tariq Ali Bukhari, 
remained posted as Secretary Establishment and retired on 04.03.2005, these 
all after having been promoted as Secretaries to Government of Pakistan were 
reemployed after their superannuation and were allowed the Package but the 
Respondent No.1 was refused. According to Schedule I read with Schedule II 
of the Rules ibid. National Security Council is not listed as a Division where 
reportedly Mr. Tariq Aziz served and retired on 26.05.2002, yet he was 
allotted an additional plot. Similarly, Mr. Nawid Ahsan, Syed Tariq Ali 
Bukhari and Vakil Ahmad Khan though had been working as Secretaries but 
whether they served as head of the Divisions had not been disclosed. 
Therefore, this very allotment made to the above four ones is a visible 
discrimination with the Respondent No.1. 
10.  
It is by now well settled law that although Article 25 of the 
Constitution allows for differential treatment of persons who are not 
similarly placed under a reasonable classification, yet it is also equally 
settled that in order to justify this difference in treatment the reasonable 
classification must be based on intelligible differentia that has a rational 
nexus with the object being sought to be achieved. This means that any 
distinct treatment meted out to a class of persons can only be sustained 
under Article 25 if the aforesaid test is satisfied. Reliance is placed upon 
Hadayat Ullah and others v. Federation of Pakistan and others (2022 
SCMR 1691). Similarly, it is also well settled that in order to establish a 
reasonable classification based on intelligible differentia, the differentiation 
must have been understood logically and there should not be any artificial 
grouping for specific purpose causing injustice to other similarly placed 
individuals. It was further held in Syed Azam Shah v. Federation of 
Pakistan through Secretary Cabinet Division, Cabinet Secretariat, 
Islamabad and another (2022 SCMR 201) that the concept of 
reasonableness is rationally a fundamental component of equality or non-
arbitrariness. This very question is further elaborated in the case of Dr. 

I.C.A.No.431 of 2016 
 
           7 
Mobashir Hassan v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2010 SC 265), wherein 
the Supreme Court held that intelligible differentia distinguishes persons or 
things from the other persons or things, who have been left out. The Court 
held that the definition of classification "intelligible differentia" means 
differentiating between two sets of the people or objects, all such 
differentiations should be easily understood and should not be artificial. 
Similarly in the case of Secretary Economic Affairs Division, Islamabad 
and others v. Anwarul Haq Ahmed and others (2013 SCMR 1687), the 
Supreme Court further held that by now it is well settled that equality 
clause does not prohibit classification for those differently circumstanced 
provided a rational standard is laid down. The Supreme Court further held 
in the case of Muhammad Shabbir Ahmed Nasir v. Secretary, Finance 
Division, Islamabad and another (1997 SCMR 1026), that a law applying 
to one person or one class of persons may be Constitutionally valid if there 
is sufficient basis or reason for it but a classification which is arbitrary and 
is not founded on any rational basis is no classification as to warrant its 
exclusion from the mischief of Article 25. 
11.   
It has been further elucidated in Government of Khyber 
Pakhtunkhwa through Chief Secretary and others v. Syed Sadiq Shah 
and others (2021 SCMR 747) that it must always rest upon some real and 
substantial distinction bearing a just and reasonable relation to the object 
sought to be achieved by the authority. The Court further held that Article 
25 forbids class legislation but it does not forbid classification or 
differentiation which rests upon reasonable grounds of distinction. The 
classification however must not be arbitrary, artificial or evasive but must 
be based on some real and substantial bearing, a just and reasonable 
relation to the object sought to be achieved by the legislation. The Court 
also held that in order to pass the test of reasonableness there must be a 
substantial basis for making the classification and there should be a nexus 
between the basis of classification and the object of action under 
consideration based upon justiciable reasoning. Besides, the word 
“reasonable” has been defined in Black’s Law Dictionary (Ninth Edition) 

I.C.A.No.431 of 2016 
 
           8 
as “Fair, proper, or moderate under the circumstances”. The term was 
further interpreted in Muhammad Nasir Mahmood and another v. 
Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Ministry of Law, Justice and 
Human Rights Division, Islamabad (PLD 2009 Supreme Court 107) 
wherein the august Supreme Court while elaborating the dictionary meaning 
of the term observed that the dictionary meaning of the word `reasonable'  is  
just, proper, fair, equitable, and that which is acceptable to a man of common 
prudence and that of the word `unreasonable' i.e. unjust, unfair and that which 
is not acceptable to a man of ordinary prudence. In the instant case, there is 
no reasonable distinction between the Respondent No.1 and other individuals 
mentioned above and there is no justified reason to isolate the case of the 
respondent from the said other similarly placed individuals because the 
posting of officers of same rank to different posts solely rests upon the 
choice and selection of the competent authority. Therefore carving out any 
criteria to exclude certain officers and accommodate others of the same 
rank would tantamount to creation of artificial grouping causing injustice to 
the first mentioned officers hence any such classification cannot be 
excluded from the mischief of Article 25 of the Constitution. 
12.   
The upshot of the above discussion is that persons might be 
classified into groups and such groups might be treated differently, if there 
was a reasonable basis for such difference. However having carefully 
considered the matter in hand, in our view there were no intelligible 
differentiae that distinguished the case of the Respondent No.1 from the 
other similarly placed individuals mentioned and discussed above. 
Therefore, summing up the matter and on finding that the Respondent No.1 
after having been promoted and posted as Secretary (BS-22) under the order 
of competent authority, ‘becomes eligible’ for allotment of an additional plot 
and that as additional plots were granted to the Secretaries names of whom are 
mentioned above, therefore, their case being on a par with that of the 
Respondent No.1, it would not be justifiable to deprive him from a 
facility/benefit which had been awarded to those standing on the same 
footings. We do not see any illegality in the impugned judgment passed by the 

I.C.A.No.431 of 2016 
 
           9 
learned Single Judge calling for interference by the Division Bench. 
Consequently, this Appeal stands dismissed.
