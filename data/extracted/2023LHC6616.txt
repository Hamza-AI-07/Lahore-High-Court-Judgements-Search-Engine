JUDGMENT 
 
Date of Hearing:

Petitioner By: 
Mr. Sheraz Mahmood, Advocate 
Mr. Mubashar Hussain, Advocate 
Respondent No. 1 By:  
Khawaja Omer Masood, Advocate 
 
ABID HUSSAIN CHATTHA, J: This Judgment shall decide the titled and 
connected Writ Petition Nos. 40700, 40702, 40707, 40710 & 40713 of 2023 
directed against separate impugned Judgments all dated 20.03.2023 passed by 
Punjab Labour Appellate Tribunal, Lahore (the “PLAT”) involving identical 
question of law and similar set of facts. 
2. 
 
Precisely, the private Respondents arrayed as Respondent No. 1 
in the titled and connected Petitions, hereinafter collectively referred to as   
(the “Respondents”), filed their respective claims before the “Authority” 
constituted under Section 15 of the Payment of Wages Act, 1936 (the “Wages 
Act”) against the Petitioner for recovery of their alleged deducted dues. The 
claims were contested by the Petitioner. After recording of evidence of the 
parties, the Authority partially allowed the claims of the Respondents vide 
separate orders all dated 28.02.2020. The parties preferred cross appeals under 
Section 17 of the Wages Act before the Punjab Labour Court No. 2, Lahore 
(the “Labour Court”) which were dismissed vide separate consolidated 
Judgments all dated 01.08.2022. Thereafter, the Respondents instituted

Revision Petition under Section 47(5) of the Punjab Industrial Relations Act, 
2010 (the “PIRA”) before PLAT which were accepted vide impugned 
separate Judgments all dated 20.03.2023, whereby, the respective claims of 
the Respondents were enhanced. Hence, the titled and connected Petitions.  
3. 
 
Learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the impugned 
Judgments are without jurisdiction, unlawful, void and coram non judice since 
no remedy of revision is provided under the Wages Act. He explained that 
after determination of claim by the Authority under Section 15 of the Wages 
Act followed by an Appeal under Section 17 thereof before the Labour Court, 
the Respondents could have only invoked the constitutional jurisdiction of this 
Court under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”) since the remedy of revision under 
Section 47(5) of PIRA was not available to the Respondents. He maintained 
that in case titled, “Habib Bank Ltd. through President and 2 others v. 
Authority under Payment of Wages Act and another” (2016 PLC 61), this 
Court held that the remedy of revision before PLAT against the order passed 
by the Labour Court is no more available after the repeal of the Industrial 
Relations Ordinance, 1969 (the “Ordinance, 1969”). Highlighting the 
difference between PIRA and repealed Ordinance, 1969, he argued that 
Section 38(3) of the Ordinance, 1969 conferred appellate jurisdiction upon 
PLAT constituted thereunder to confirm, set aside, vary or modify the award 
and could exercise all the powers conferred by the Ordinance, 1969 save as 
otherwise provided therein,  however, in contrast, Section 47(3) of PIRA only 
confers a limited appellate power upon PLAT constituted thereunder to 
confirm, set aside, vary or modify the award, decision or sentence given or 
passed under Sections 33, 42 or 44 of PIRA and can exercise all powers 
conferred under PIRA save as otherwise provided therein. Hence, where the 
Labour Court decided an Appeal under Section 17 of the Wages Act, the 
revisional jurisdiction under Section 47(5) of PIRA was not available to 
PLAT as the same could only be exercised with reference to its appellate 
jurisdiction under Section 47(3) of PIRA. He further stressed that even

W. P. No. 40700 / 2023 
W. P. No. 40702 / 2023

W. P. No. 40710 / 2023

otherwise, the remedy of revision under Section 47(5) of PIRA is in the nature 
of suo motu power and cannot be invoked as of right by the aggrieved party. 
Further, the suo motu revisional jurisdiction of PLAT is against an ‘order’ 
passed by the Labour Court and not against ‘final judgment’ of the Labour 
Court. Reliance was also placed on an unreported Order dated 03.12.2020 
passed in case titled, “Marhaba Laboratories (Pvt) Ltd. v. Punjab Labour 
Court No. 2, Lahore etc.” (W. P. No.  21196 / 2016). 
4. 
 
Learned counsel for the Petitioner on merits submitted that the 
Respondents had received their respective due amounts by signing the ‘Final 
Settlement Form’ available on record but the same was ignored by PLAT 
while enhancing the respective claims of the Respondents. After accepting 
and receiving the final settlement amounts through their bank accounts, the 
Respondents were not entitled to enhanced amounts. Hence, the impugned 
Judgments of PLAT are not sustainable in the eyes of law. 
5. 
 
Conversely, learned counsel for the Respondents contended that 
PLAT has revisional jurisdiction against any ‘order’ which includes ‘final 
order’ or ‘final judgment’ passed by the Labour Court under Section 17 of the 
Wages Act as held in cases titled, “Muhammad Hussain and others v. Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan through Chairman, Railway Board Lahore and others” 
(PLD 1991 Supreme Court 385) and order dated 18.05.2021 passed in case 
titled, “Jang Group of Newspapers Limited, etc. v. Presiding Officer, etc.” 
(W. P. No. 10067 / 2017). The Authority under the Wages Act partially 
decreed the respective claims of the Respondents by ignoring service 
certificates of the Respondents relying upon oral evidence of the Petitioner 
controverting service certificates and as such, only considered length of 
service of the Respondents as submitted by the Petitioner. However, PLAT 
duly considered documentary evidence tendered by the Respondents and 
rightly preferred it over oral evidence. The Authority failed to consider that 
the Respondents had never received their full and final settlement amounts, 
rather, had only received their partial payments which were categorically 
mentioned in their respective claims. The Authority and the Labour Court did

not resolve the points of controversy regarding claims of notice pay, gratuity, 
annual leaves, bonus and wage for the month of August, 2015 and as such, 
misread and non-read the evidence on record which was duly corrected by 
PLAT in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction. Hence, the titled and connected 
Petitions are liable to be dismissed. 
6. 
 
The following points of determination arise from the rival 
arguments of learned counsels for the parties:- 
i) 
Whether PLAT has revisional jurisdiction under Section 
47(5) of PIRA with respect to order of the Labour Court 
passed in Appeal under Section 17 of the Wages Act; and  
ii) 
Whether the impugned Judgments suffer from any 
illegality, infirmity or jurisdictional defect warranting 
interference in the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court. 
7. 
 
The Wages Act is enacted to regulate the payment of wages to 
certain classes of persons employed in industry. Section 1(4) of the Wages 
Act contemplates that it applies to the payment of wages to persons employed 
in any factory, industrial or commercial establishment. Section 15 thereof 
empowers the Provincial Government to constitute the Authority to hear and 
decide all claims arising out of deductions from the wages or delay in 
payment of the wages or non-payment of dues relating to provident fund or 
gratuity payable under any law. Section 17(1) of the Wages Act provides 
remedy of appeal against a direction of the Authority under Section 15 thereof 
before the Labour Court constituted under the Ordinance, 1969 within whose 
jurisdiction, the cause of action to which the appeal relates arose, subject to 
restrictions contained therein. Section 17(1A) of the Wages Act stipulates that 
all appeals pending before any District Court under this Section immediately 
before the commencement of the Labour Laws (Amendment) Act, 1975 shall, 
on such commencement, stand transferred to, and be disposed of by, the 
Labour Court within whose jurisdiction the cause of action to which the 
appeal relates arose.

PIRA was promulgated with the objective to regulate formation 
of trade unions and trade union activities, relations between employers and 
workmen and the avoidance and settlement of any differences or disputes 
arising between them along with ancillary matters. Section 1(2) & (3) thereof 
provide that PIRA extends to the Province of Punjab and applies to all persons 
employed in any establishment or industry with certain exceptions listed 
therein which are not relevant for the purpose of present adjudication. Section 
33(1) of PIRA relates to redressal of individual grievances and allows a 
worker to bring his grievance in respect of any right guaranteed or secured to 
him by or under any law or any award or settlement to the notice of his 
employer in writing, either himself or through his shop steward or collective 
bargaining agent within three months of the day on which the cause of such 
grievance arises. Other provisions of Section 33 of PIRA deal with different 
procedural stages of the grievance and Sub-Section 6 thereof, in the case of 
non-redressal of the grievance, confers the right upon the worker to invoke the 
jurisdiction of the Labour Court, which in turn, is established under Section 
44 of PIRA by the Provincial Government. Section 44(4) of PIRA lists the 
disputes which the Labour Court is empowered to hear and adjudicate. 
Importantly, Clause (c) thereof empowers the Labour Court to try offences 
under PIRA and such other offences under any other law as the Government 
may, by notification in the official Gazette, specify in this behalf. Similarly, 
Clause (f) thereof postulates that the Labour Court shall exercise and perform 
such other powers and functions as are or may be conferred upon or assigned 
to it by or under PIRA or any other law. (Emphasis supplied).                          
PLAT is established under Section 47 of PIRA. It bestows appellate                          
and revisional powers upon PLAT. Section 47(3) of PIRA with respect                          
to appellate powers, allows PLAT to confirm, set aside, vary or modify the 
award, decision or sentence given or passed under Sections 33, 42 or                           
44 of PIRA and states that PLAT shall exercise all the powers                           
conferred 
 
by 
PIRA 
to 
the 
Court, 
save 
as 
otherwise 
provided.                           
Sections 47(5) to (7) of PIRA confer revisional powers upon PLAT

which being relevant to the controversy in hand are reproduced for ready 
reference as under:- 
“(5) The Tribunal may, on its own motion at any time, call for 
the record of any case or proceedings under the Act in which a 
Labour Court within its jurisdiction has passed an order for the 
purpose of satisfying itself as to the correctness, legality, or 
propriety of such order, and may pass such order in relation 
thereto as it thinks fit. 
(6) 
No order under sub-section (5) shall be passed revising or 
modifying any order adversely affecting any person without 
giving such person a reasonable opportunity of being heard. 
(7) 
The Tribunal shall follow such procedure as may be 
prescribed.” 
 
9. 
 
The conjunctive reading of the afore-noted provisions of law 
under the Wages Act and PIRA make it manifestly evident that the scope, 
canvas and area of operation of PIRA is much wider, broader and general in 
comparison to the Wages Act. The latter is limited to due determination of 
wages to certain classes of persons employed in industrial or commercial 
establishment, whereas, the persons employed in any establishment or 
industry which are not specifically excluded from the application of PIRA in 
the Province of the Punjab can bring host of multifarious grievances with 
respect to any right guaranteed or secured to a worker by or under any law 
before the Labour Court. Once the claim of wages of a person is determined 
by the Authority under Section 15 of the Wages Act, the appeal is preferred 
before the Labour Court which has been made available under Section 17 of 
the Wages Act by reference to the Ordinance, 1969 which empowered the 
Provincial Governments under Sections 35 and 38 thereof, to constitute and 
establish the Labour Court and PLAT. The Ordinance, 1969 was repealed 
through the Industrial Relations Ordinance, 2002 which in turn was repealed 
by the Industrial Relations Act, 2008. After the devolution of further subjects 
to the Provinces under the Constitution (Eighteenth Amendment) Act, 2010, 
the Industrial Relations Act, 2008 was repealed and the Industrial Relations 
Act, 2012 was promulgated at the Federal level. In the Province of the Punjab, 
the Punjab Industrial Relations Ordinance, 2010 was promulgated which was

repealed by PIRA as successor law. Acknowledging the afore-noted 
transition, Section 79(1)(c) of PIRA with the title of ‘repeal and savings’ 
states that notwithstanding the repeal of Industrial Relations Act, 2008, every 
reference to the repealed Industrial Relations Act, 2008 shall be construed as 
reference to the Industrial Relations Act, 2008. It was only in this context 
that in the case of Habib Bank Limited (supra), while deciding an objection 
qua availability of remedy of revision before PLAT against orders passed 
by the Labour Court, it was observed that firstly, after repeal of Ordinance, 
1969, the said remedy is no more available and secondly, the bank 
authorities being trans-provincial establishment could not approach PLAT 
as its jurisdiction was ousted in terms of Section 57(2)(b) of the Industrial 
Relations Act, 2012 which has further been elaborated by the Apex Court 
of the country in case titled, “Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd. 
v. Member, NIRC and others” (2014 SCMR 535). Hence, the said case 
relied upon by the Petitioner is based on distinguishing facts in which the 
question of remedy of revision under Section 47(5) of PIRA with respect to 
an appeal decided under Section 17 of the Wages Act was not directly in 
issue. 
10. 
 
Conversely, the case of Muhammad Hussain (supra) is 
squarely relevant to the issue in hand. In the said case, the Authority 
accepted the grievance of the applicant. An appeal against it before the 
Labour Court by the other side was accepted, whereafter, Revision Petition 
was decided by PLAT. The order of PLAT was further assailed through 
constitutional Petition before this Court and eventually, the matter went to 
the Supreme Court. The precise question before the Supreme Court was as 
to whether PLAT was competent to revise an order passed by the Labour 
Court under the Wages Act. It was importantly held in Paragraph Nos. 9 & 
10 as under:- 
“9. It may be mentioned that before the amendment of the 
Payment of Wages Act by Ordinance XII of 1974, an appeal 
from the order of the Authority lay before the District Court.

There was some doubt whether an order made by the District 
Court in appeal was final by virtue of the provisions of 
subsection (2) of the same section and for that reason it fell 
outside the revisional jurisdiction of the High Court under 
section 115, Code of Civil Procedure. This doubt was resolved 
by this Court in the case of S.M. Rahman and Co. v. Motabar 
PLD 1981 SC 282 wherein it was held that the order made by 
the District Court was revisable by the High Court under 
section 115, Code of Civil Procedure. The Court observed: 
 
"The argument that there is a finality attaching to the 
order of the Authority under section 15 of the Act 
subject only to the appellate jurisdiction of the District 
Court under section 17(c) of the Act, does not advance 
the case any further, as such finality only means that the 
order of the Authority can be challenged only by way of 
appeal to the District Court and not otherwise; but 
there is no such limitation in respect of the appellate 
order made by the District Court as ordinarily 
constituted, in which capacity it is subordinate to the 
High Court." 
 
By the amendments made by Ordinance XII of 1974 the forum 
of appeal was changed from the District Court to the Labour 
Court. As will be noticed the amendment has revived the 
controversy whether the decision made by the Labour Court 
as appellate forum is to be treated as final and beyond the 
reach of the Labour Appellate Tribunal which ordinarily 
exercises appellate and revisional jurisdiction over its 
decisions under subsection (3a) of section 38, Industrial 
Relations Ordinance. In our opinion, the provisions of clause 
(d) of section 35(5), Industrial Relations Ordinance should put 
an end to the controversy. It will appear from this clause that 
the performance of functions under other laws is a part of the 
normal duties of a Labour Court. That being so, even when it 
exercises jurisdiction under other laws it does not act as a 
special forum outside the ambit of the Industrial Relations 
Ordinance, but, on the other hand, it is performing a function 
specifically provided for by the Ordinance. It is, therefore, 
difficult to subscribe to the view taken by the learned Single 
Judge in the Lahore High Court that the exercise of appellate 
jurisdiction by the Labour Court under the Payment of Wages 
Act is not a proceeding under the Ordinance. Consequently, 
the main premises upon which he has proceeded to hold 
against the competence of the Labour Appellate Tribunal to

exercise revisional jurisdiction is erroneous. His view that the 
Payment of Wages Act and Industrial Relations Ordinance 
envisage only two fora for the redress of the grievance of the 
workmen is founded only on an assumption without any firm 
basis. As noticed earlier, prior to the amendment of section 
17, Payment of Wages Act, the appeal from the order of the 
Authority lay before the District Court. Despite the provisions 
of section 17(2) of the Act which clothed the order of the 
appellate Court with finality this Court, as pointed out above, 
in S.M. Rahman & Co., ibid, held that the said order was 
revisable under section 115, Code of Civil Procedure, by the 
High Court. The rules framed under the Payment of Wages 
Act for institution and disposal of appeal do not lay down any 
special procedure which may be regarded as indicative of the 
intention to constitute the Labour Court as a forum of a 
special nature. 
10. 
For the reasons stated above we would hold that the 
order made by the Labour Appellate Tribunal in its revisional 
jurisdiction was within its competence and the High Court 
erred in declaring it to be without lawful authority and of no 
legal effect.” 
 
11. 
 
The same view was taken by this Court in case of Jang Group 
of Newspapers Limited (supra). Therefore, there is no ambiguity that the 
Ordinance, 1969 as referred to in Section 17 of the Wages Act relates to PIRA 
as its successor law. Since the Labour Court constituted under Section 44 of 
PIRA is empowered to exercise and perform such other powers and functions 
as are or may be conferred upon or assigned to it by PIRA or any other law 
such as the Wages Act, therefore, the Labour Court exercises jurisdiction over 
disputes beyond the purview of PIRA. As such, the Labour Court under the 
command of Section 17 of the Wages Act is competent to hear appeals against 
the Authority constituted under Section 15 of the Wages Act. Similarly, 
PLAT constituted under Section 47 of PIRA exercises both appellate and 
revisional powers with respect to orders passed by the Labour Court subject to 
various provisions of PIRA. Section 47(5) of PIRA vests revisional power 
upon PLAT with respect to ‘any case or proceedings’ under PIRA regarding 
an ‘order’ which includes a ‘final order’ or ‘final judgment’ and may pass 
such order in relation thereto, as it thinks fit. As such, there is no cavil to the

proposition that PLAT is vested with revisional powers with respect to an 
order passed by the Labour Court and the same includes such orders which 
the Labour Court may pass under any other law to which its jurisdiction 
extends such as its orders passed in appeal under Section 17 of the Wages 
Act. 
12. 
 
This leads to the next question regarding the nature of revisional 
jurisdiction of PLAT. Bare perusal of Sections 47(5), (6) & (7) of PIRA 
reveal that revisional jurisdiction of PLAT is inherently suo motu. However, 
where PLAT proceeds under its revisional jurisdiction, it is required to issue 
notice and hear the other side in the event of any adverse order against it and 
follow such procedure as may be ‘prescribed’. The Supreme Court in case 
titled, “Ghulam Qadir and others v. Sh. Abdul Wadood and others” (PLD 
2016 Supreme Court 712) dilated upon two aspects of revisional jurisdiction 
with respect to Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908                         
(the “CPC”). It opined that one aspect of revisional jurisdiction is when the 
revisional Court itself takes cognizance of a matter while exercising its suo 
motu powers while the second aspect is when a person brings the matter to the 
notice of the revisional Court. This bifurcation is significant as in the first 
case, the matter is only between the revisional Court and the subordinate 
Court, whereas, in the second instance, it is essentially an adversarial 
litigation, although the Court is still acting in its supervisory jurisdiction. In 
case titled, “Khan Bahadur Khan v. Khan Malook Khan” (PLD 2022 
Supreme Court 482), the Supreme Court further remarked that the Court in 
terms of Section 115 of the CPC in exercise of its suo motu jurisdiction can 
adjudicate a revision petition even after the period of limitation because 
exercise of revisional jurisdiction in any form is discretionary. As such, the 
Court can always exercise suo motu jurisdiction if the conditions for its 
exercise are satisfied because the Court cannot be robbed of its suo motu 
jurisdiction simply because the petition invoking such jurisdiction is filed 
beyond the period of limitation. In such an eventuality, the petition can validly 
be treated as an information laid before the Court even if it suffers from

procedural lapses or loopholes as revisional jurisdiction is inherently and pre-
eminently corrective and supervisory. The Supreme Court in case titled, 
“Messrs Norwich Union Fire Insurance Society Limited v. Muhammad Javed 
Iqbal and another” (1986 SCMR 1071) precisely examined the revisional 
jurisdiction vested upon PLAT in terms of Section 38(3-a) of the Ordinance, 
1969 which is pari materia to Sections 47(5)(6) & (7) of PIRA. It was 
importantly observed that no principle of law or any precedent was quoted to 
show that suo motu statutory power cannot be invoked by PLAT on the 
application of a party to proceedings before the Labour Court. As such, it was 
held that there would not be any bar on PLAT to exercise its revisional 
jurisdiction, if the requisite information comes before it from any source 
including an application made by any party. This is for the reason that 
revisional jurisdiction vested with PLAT is supervisory in nature in order to 
enable PLAT placed at the apex of hierarchy of Tribunals setup by the 
Ordinance, 1969 to examine the legality  or propriety of proceedings taken or 
an order passed by the Labour Court.  
13. 
 
Therefore, it follows from the above that there is no bar upon 
any party in laying the information before PLAT in the form of a Revision 
Petition not as a matter of right but in the discretion of PLAT which in turn 
may decide to assume revisional jurisdiction depending upon the facts and 
circumstances of each case warranting exercise or otherwise of revisional 
jurisdiction. Accordingly, if PLAT exercises its revisional powers, as it did in 
the titled and connected Petitions, PLAT is acting within its lawful revisional 
jurisdiction to examine the correctness, legality or propriety of any order 
passed by the Labour Court. Therefore, it is a fallacy to hold that PLAT does 
not have revisional power with respect to an order passed by the Labour Court 
in appeal preferred under Section 17 of the Wages Act. 
14. 
 
The impugned Judgments of PLAT have been individually 
examined on the basis of evidence on record with reference to the respective 
claims of the Respondents. The Respondents were shown the door without 
assigning any reason. Primarily, the service period of the Respondents is in

dispute. PLAT in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction while scrutinizing the 
evidence on record, came to the conclusion that computerized service record 
of the Respondents was not produced by the Petitioner before the Authority; 
the computerized service certificates tendered by the Respondents are genuine 
as the same had not been disproved by the Petitioner; and accordingly, 
specific respective claims of the Respondents with respect to notice pay, 
gratuity, annual leaves, bonus and wage for the month of August, 2015 were 
independently and separately scrutinized to determine the amount due based 
upon length of service of the Respondents corresponding to their respective 
computerized service certificates. Consequently, the Respondents in the titled 
and connected Petitions No. 40700, 40702, 40707, 40710 & 40713 of 2023 
were held entitled to receive Rs. 495,078; Rs. 75,016; Rs. 143,428; Rs. 
171,164; Rs. 655,434; and Rs. 289,076, respectively. The mere signing of 
unilaterally prepared ‘Final Settlement Forms’ by the Respondents cannot be 
regarded as final settlements in the absence of their free consent. The 
Respondents promptly agitated their grievances and are still pursuing the 
same. As such, the mere receipt of partial amounts based upon calculations of 
the Petitioner does not place any bar upon the Respondents to invoke the law 
for redressal of their grievances. Hence, there is no illegality or infirmity or 
jurisdictional defect in the impugned Judgments. 
15. 
 
In view of the above, the titled and connected Petitions are 
devoid of any merit and the same are dismissed with costs of Rs. 100,000/- 
each. The costs shall be paid by the Petitioner to the Respondents within 30 
days from the date of this Judgment, failing which, the Respondents shall be 
entitled to recover the same through the Authority.
