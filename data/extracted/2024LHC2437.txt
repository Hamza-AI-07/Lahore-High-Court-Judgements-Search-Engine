Date of Hearing: 
06.05.2024 
Petitioner by: 
Mr. Shezada Mazhar, Advocate.  
Respondent No.1 by: 
Mr. Fayyaz Mahmood Khan, 
Advocate.  
Anwaar Hussain, J.  
Challenge has been laid to the 
concurrent findings of the Courts below whereby the eviction petition 
filed by respondent No.1 (“the respondent”) has been allowed after 
dismissal of leave to appear and contest (“PLA”) filed by the 
petitioner in terms of Section 22 of the Punjab Rented Premises Act, 
2009 (“the Act”).  
2. 
By way of factual background, it has been noted that, on 
22.06.2022, the respondent filed ejectment petition with the averments 
that the rented premises, detail whereof is given in para 2 of the 
ejectment petition, was rented out to the petitioner, under an oral 
agreement, and the petitioner has committed default since April, 2018. 
The petitioner was initially proceeded against ex-parte and final order 
dated 05.09.2022 was passed after recording of evidence of the 
respondent, which upon filing of application by the petitioner was set 
aside whereafter the petitioner filed the PLA with the averments that 
he was inducted, as tenant, by father of the respondent in the year 
2000, under an oral tenancy, and he continued to pay the amount of 
monthly rent and after demise of father of the respondent, the 
petitioner has been paying rent to the mother of the respondent against 
receipts, however,  one year prior to the filing of the ejectment 
petition, the respondent started claiming payment of rent  directly to

him, with mala fide intention, and the ejectment petition was 
accordingly filed. While placing reliance on the dicta laid down by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in case reported as “Shajar Islam v. 
Muhammad Siddique and 2 others” (PLD 2007 SC 45), the Rent 
Tribunal, through impugned order dated 14.04.2023, dismissed the 
PLA of the petitioner, holding that the tenancy relationship exists 
between the parties. The appeal preferred by the petitioner, against 
order dated 14.04.2023, has also been dismissed by the Appellate 
Court below, through impugned judgment dated 30.10.2023.  
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the dicta laid 
down by the Supreme Court in case of Shajar Islam supra has been 
wrongly applied, rather misconstrued, by the Courts below in the 
instant case as the petitioner has categorically denied the tenancy 
relationship with the petitioner and claimed that he was inducted as 
tenant by the late father of the respondent in the year 2000 and 
ownership of the respondent in respect of the rented premises ipso 
facto does not make the respondent as the landlord. Adds that the 
respondent alleges default in payment of rent since April, 2018, 
however, the ejectment petition was filed in the year 2022 without 
explaining the delay thereof, which fact exhibits mala fide on part of 
the respondent and the same has escaped notice of the fora below. 
Further adds that the Rent Tribunal has erred in recording that the 
petitioner has acknowledged relationship of landlord and tenant with 
the respondent.  
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent submits that the 
Rent Tribunal has not granted arrears of the rent with effect from 
April, 2018 and even if there is any ambiguity in the impugned 
decisions, the respondent does not lay his claim as far as arrears of 
rent are concerned. Prays for dismissal of the present constitutional 
petition.

5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
6. 
It has been noted that, on 30.11.2023, when this petition was 
admitted by this Court and notices were issued, to the respondent, the 
petitioner was directed to deposit the monthly rent with the Deputy 
Registrar (Judicial) of this Court. Admittedly, the petitioner has 
committed default and the rent for the month of April, 2024 was not 
deposited by 5th of the said month as directed by this Court. The 
application was filed by the petitioner for extension of time to deposit 
the rent for the said month, which was dismissed, vide order dated 
22.04.2024. When confronted with, learned counsel for the petitioner 
has relied upon the law laid down in case reported as “Mian Umar 
Ikram-ul-Haque v. Dr. Shahida Hasnain and another” (2016 SCMR 
2186) to contend that since the relationship of landlord and tenant was 
denied, neither the Tribunal nor this Court could have directed the 
petitioner to deposit the rent, hence, the petitioner cannot be non-
suited on this ground. The argument is misconceived for two-fold 
reason. Firstly, order dated 30.11.2023, passed in present proceedings, 
directing the petitioner to deposit the rent was neither objected to nor 
assailed by the petitioner before the higher forum rather, the petitioner  
benefitted from the said order, partially, to the extent of retention and 
protection of possession of the rented premises. In addition, the 
petitioner side itself filed application for extension of time for deposit 
of rent on the ground that due to Eid Holidays, rent could not be 
deposited, which was dismissed vide order dated 22.04.2024 for the 
reason that Eid-ul-Fitr was on 10.04.2024 and not on or before 
05.04.2024. Hence, it behoves with the petitioner to have deposited 
the rent in compliance of the said order from which the petitioner 
cannot take such a, ironically speaking, remarkable volte face. 
Secondly, the case of Mian Umar Ikram-ul-Haque supra is of no help 
to the petitioner inasmuch as, unlike the case in hand, the petitioner

therein was claiming possession of the property disputed therein on 
the basis of an agreement to sell entered into before the execution of 
the tenancy agreement relied upon by the ejectment petitioner of the 
said case. On the contrary, the petitioner in the instant case has 
categorically admitted and acknowledged himself having been 
inducted and got possession of the rented premises as tenant albeit by 
father of the respondent through an oral tenancy. In para 3 of his 
appeal preferred against eviction order, the petitioner has stated as 
under:  
“3. 
That the succinctly stated facts of the matter are 
that the Appellant entered in to an oral rent agreement 
with the Father of Respondent in the Year 2000, 
regarding Basement of Plaza measuring 9 Marlas situated 
Block No.6, Sector A-II, Township, Lahore (“Rented 
Premises”). Since 23 years the Appellant has been 
regularly paying the rent to the Father of Respondent and 
after the demise of Father of Respondent, Appellant has 
been paying the rent to the Mother of the Respondent the 
(sic) without any default. The rent agreement is also 
extended mutually time to time. However, last year the 
Respondent started pressurizing the Appellant for the 
payment of rent to him directly instead of his mother. 
The Appellant has been paying the rent to the Mother 
of Respondent on regular basis and there is no question 
of default of the payment of rent……” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
There is no explanation as to what the petitioner did after demand of 
the respondent that the rent should be paid directly to him instead of 
his mother (of the respondent). No receipts have been referred by the 
petitioner to show that he has been continuously paying the rent to the 
mother of the respondent after the demise of the father of the 
petitioner.  
7. 
Hypothetically, even if this is presumed to be true that the 
petitioner was inducted as tenant by father of the respondent, the 
rented premises has devolved upon the respondent being legal heir, 

 
 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.79017/2023

which status of the respondent is neither denied nor disputed by the 
petitioner. Moreover, the petitioner, as a measure of showing his bona 
fide, has neither approached the Rent Tribunal for deposit of rent to be 
paid to the lawful landlord/landowner nor has been any interpleader 
suit filed rather the petitioner has failed to deposit the rent even on the 
direction of this Court. This indicates the dereliction, with audacity, 
on part of the petitioner that cannot be countenanced. The demand of 
the rent by the respondent/landowner not neutralized by conflicting 
demand by any other legal heir including the mother of the 
respondent/wife of the deceased father of the respondent (who was the 
landlord as per contention of the petitioner) obligated the petitioner to 
make payment of rent to the respondent, keeping in view the settled 
principle of law that once a tenant is always a tenant. Admittedly, the 
petitioner is not  holding the rented premises for any fixed period. It is 
also settled principle of law that an oral tenancy is a tenancy on month 
to month basis and the petitioner was obligated to vacate the rented 
premises, upon intimation of the landlord. No other person on behalf 
of father of the respondent has come forward to lay any claim, 
although the sale deeds, pertaining to the rented premises, in favour of 
the respondent depicting him exclusive owner thereof are also not 
disputed. Therefore, denial of the tenancy relationship by the 
petitioner with the respondent is contumacious and therefore, the PLA 
was rightly dismissed and ejectment order has been correctly passed 
by the fora below.  
8. 
As far as the averment of learned counsel for the petitioner that 
the Rent Tribunal has erred in allowing the ejectment petition as 
prayed for and allowed the recovery of rent from April, 2018 till 
handing over of the possession of the rented premises is concerned, 
suffice to observe that the said averment is belied from the record. In  
 

 
 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.79017/2023  
 
 
6
the impugned order dated 14.04.2023, the Rent Tribunal has held as 
under: 
“28. ….The petitioner has claimed default in payment 
of monthly rent since April-2018 but there is no 
reasonable explanation available on record as to why the 
petitioner failed to agitate his grievance for such a long 
time. Therefore, the claim of the petitioner for default 
in amount of outstanding rent since April-2018 is 
rejected….”  
(Emphasis supplied) 
The above-quoted finding of the Rent Tribunal is self-explanatory. 
Even otherwise, learned counsel for the respondent has already stated, 
before this Court, that in order to avoid litigation and/or avert 
protraction thereof, the respondent has not assailed or laid challenge 
to the finding to the extent of recovery of arrears of monthly rent and 
would be satisfied if the petitioner is evicted and possession of the 
rented premises is restored.   
9. 
There are concurrent of findings of the Courts below against the 
petitioner, which are immune from interference by this Court in its 
constitutional jurisdiction unless there is some gross illegality, 
misappreciation of record or procedural impropriety therein, which 
could not be pointed out by learned counsel for the petitioner. In the 
circumstances, no interference is called for. For what has been 
discussed above, this writ petition has no merit, hence, dismissed. No 
order as to costs.
