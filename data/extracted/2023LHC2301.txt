Mian Muhammad Afzal, Advocate for petitioner.  
 
    
Through this constitutional petition, the 
petitioner has called in question order dated 
06.07.2022 passed by learned trial court, whereby 
application under Order XIV Rule 5, 1 & 2 of the 
C.P.C filed by the petitioner, who was defendant No. 
24 in the suit for declaration, permanent and 
mandatory injunctions filed by respondents Nos. 3 & 
4 has been dismissed and has also called in question 
judgment dated 08.04.2023 passed by learned Addl. 
District Judge, Kasur, whereby revision petition filed 
by the petitioner against the afore-referred order has 
also been dismissed. 
2.   
 It is contended by the learned counsel for 
the petitioner that as the respondent No.3/one of the 
plaintiffs of the suit during pendency of the suit got 
recorded her statement on 09.02.2019 that she had 
entered into compromise with defendants No. 21 to 
23 (now respondents No. 25 to 27) and has received 
Rs. 18,00,000/- from them and had thereafter 
withdrawn her claim to their extent, therefore, she 
was estopped from claiming the relief as prayed for 
in the civil suit, for which purpose the petitioner had 
filed an application under Order XIV Rule 5, 1 & 2 
of the C.P.C for framing of an issue to the effect 
“Whether the plaintiff is estopped by her act and 
conduct? OPP”, which application has been dismissed 
and revision filed there-against has also been 

 
W.P. No. 27318 of 2023 
2 
 
dismissed without appreciating the said aspect of the 
matter, hence, the impugned orders are not 
sustainable. Prays for setting-aside the said orders 
and allowing his application for framing of additional 
issue. 
3.   
 Perusal of record shows that respondents 
No. 3 and 4 filed a suit for declaration, permanent 
and mandatory injunctions against the petitioner and 
respondents No. 5 to 27, wherein they claimed 
themselves to be owner of land measuring 79 Kanal 
13 Marlas being successors in interest of deceased 
Sana Ullah and Aziz Begum and also challenged the 
validity of the impugned inheritance of Muhammad 
Anwar, predecessor-in-interest of respondent No. 9 
and mutation No. 632 dated 11.05.2005 and during 
the course of proceedings of the suit, the respondent 
No. 3 („one of the plaintiffs’) withdrew her suit to the 
extent of respondents No. 24 to 27 on the basis of 
statement got recorded by her on 09.02.2019. The 
petitioner filed his written statement on 17.08.2020 
and contested the suit, wherein specific plea of 
estoppel was not raised despite availability of afore-
referred statement on the record. Issues were framed 
there-after on 20.09.2021. Where-after during the 
pendency of trial wherein evidence of PWs was 
recorded, the petitioner filed an application on 
13.06.2022 for framing of additional issue relating to 
estoppel, 
which 
application 
was 
dismissed 
concurrently by both the courts below. The petitioner 
had neither raised the defence of estoppel through his 
written statement nor permission was sought for to 
amend his written statement and on the basis of 
pleading of the parties, issues were framed by the 
court by narrowing down the determinable questions 
arising out of controversy between the parties 

 
W.P. No. 27318 of 2023 
3 
 
through their pleadings and the same was done in 
terms of principles laid down in Order XIV Rule 1 
C.P.C, which requires framing of issues when a 
material proposition of fact or law is affirmed by one 
party and denied by the other, sub-Rule (1) and (2) of 
which is reproduced below:-  
“1. Framing of issues (1) Issues arise when a 
material proposition of fact or law is affirmed 
by the one party and denied by the other. 
(2) Material propositions are those propositions 
of law or fact which a plaintiff must allege in 
order to show a right to sue or a defendant must 
allege in order to constitute his defence. 
……………………………………………..” 
 
    
In terms of the afore-said provision, the 
learned trial court had framed the following issues:- 
“1. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to a 
decree for declaration as prayed for? OPP 
2. If the above said issue is proved in 
affirmative, whether the plaintiffs are entitled to 
a decree for possession with permanent 
injunction as prayed for? OPP 
3. Whether the plaintiff has not come to the 
court with unclean hands? OPD 
4. Whether the plaintiff has no cause of action 
and locus standi to file the instant suit? OPD 
5. Whether the instant suit is not proceedable in 
its present form due to mis-joinder and non-
joinder of proper and necessary parties? OPD 
6. Relief?” 
 
    
The evidence of PWs was also recorded, 
where-after on 13.06.2022, the petitioner filed an 
application for framing of additional issue in the 
following terms:-  
“Whether the plaintiff is estopped by her act 
and conduct? OPP”,  
 
Additional issue framed under XIV Rule 5 of the 
C.P.C is reproduced below:- 
“(1) The Court may at any time before passing a 
decree amend the issues or frame additional issues 
on such terms as it thinks fit, and all such 
amendments or additional issues as may be 
necessary 
for 
determining 
the 
matters 
in 

 
W.P. No. 27318 of 2023 
4 
 
controversy between the parties shall be so made 
or framed.” 
 
4.    
The learned trial court declined to frame the 
additional issue on the ground that petitioner had not 
raised plea of estoppel as defence in his written 
statement and the respondent No.3/plaintiff had 
settled the matter with respondent Nos. 24 to 27 but 
had not accepted the execution of impugned 
mutations challenged in the suit. Moreover, she had 
not simply withdrawn her claim to the extent of 
afore-referred respondents but had received Rs. 
18,00,000/-, and the issues had been framed by 
keeping in view the pleadings of the parties and the 
petitioner had not raised issue of estoppel in his 
written statement. Furthermore, it was held by the 
trial court that if the petitioner thinks that issue 
erupted during proceedings of suit even then he 
cannot agitate the same because the respondent No.3/ 
plaintiff had not stepped back from her original claim 
and principle of estoppel is not applicable to her. 
Besides, the application for amended issue had been 
filed after a lapse of more than 3-years of statement 
got recorded by the respondent No. 3 on 12.02.2019. 
Moreover, examination-in-chief of PWs-1 and 2 had 
been already recorded by the court on 29.03.2022 
and the instant application had been filed just to 
delay the matter.  
5.    
The learned Addl. District Judge, Kasur, 
has already considered the said aspect of the matter 
and dismissed the revision petition filed by the 
petitioner by upholding the findings of trial court 
while observing as under:- 
 
“05. In the present case neither any objection with 
regard to the principle of estoppel has been taken 
by the petitioner in his written statement nor he 
applied to the learned trial court for permission to 

 
W.P. No. 27318 of 2023 
5 
 
amend his pleadings/written statement in order to 
incorporate 
his 
objection 
regarding 
the 
application of the principle of estoppel. There is 
nothing on the record that the petitioner had taken 
any objection on the basis of principle of estoppel. 
Therefore, the learned trial court has rightly 
declined the petitioner‟s prayer for framing of an 
additional issue with regard to the application of 
principle of estoppel. Therefore, the impugned 
order has been passed by the learned trial court in 
accordance with law and there is nothing to 
suggest that the learned trial court has exercised 
the jurisdiction not vested in it or has exercised 
the jurisdiction so vested with any material 
irregularity or illegality. 
06. In view of the facts discussed above, the 
impugned order calls for no interference of this 
court in its revisional jurisdiction. Therefore, the 
instant revision petition being devoid of any force 
is hereby dismissed. Memo of costs be prepared.” 
 
6.   
Perusal of the record shows that despite 
availability of statement of respondent No. 3 
recorded on 09.02.2019, the plea of estoppel was not 
raised by the petitioner, which was a legal 
requirement in terms of sub-Rule (1) of Rule 1 of 
Order XIV of the C.P.C, as the same provides that 
issues arise when a material proposition of fact or 
law is affirmed by one party and denied by the other 
party and sub-Rule (2) define material proposition as 
those propositions of law and fact, which a plaintiff 
must allege in order to show a right to sue or a 
defendant must allege in order to constitute his 
defence, hence, the petitioner failing to raise said 
defence is not entitled to claim framing of additional 
issue on the question of estoppel. The trial court has 
already framed issues No. 1,2,4 and 5 relating to 
entitlement of the plaintiffs/respondent Nos. 3 & 4 
for decree and existence of cause of action in their 
favour and the suit being proceedable in the present 
form, wherein the claim of the petitioner of estoppel 
of the plaintiffs to claim decree can very well be 
considered if evidence produced on record so 

 
W.P. No. 27318 of 2023 
6 
 
establishes for the reason that the afore-referred 
issues are in general terms and the entire case has to 
be decided on the basis of the same keeping in view 
the evidence available on the record and while doing 
so the court can deal with the question of estoppel if 
the same arises for determination of the same at the 
time of final decision, therefore, no prejudice would 
be caused to the rights of the petitioner if additional 
issue relating to estoppel is not framed by the court. 
For reaching this conclusion reference may be made 
to 1988 S C M R 4 (Mst. SUGHRA BIBI alias 
MEHRAN BIBI versus ASGHAR KHAN and 
another), wherein it is provided that failure to frame 
one or other issue at trial stage, in circumstances of 
case would not have the effect of nullifying the trial, 
and the Parties were required to lead evidence 
keeping in view the precise grounds pressed by them 
and no prejudice would be caused to parties due to 
framing of an omnibus issue by trial court. Moreover, 
it was also held that it was the duty of parties to get 
proper issues framed, if they had any objection or 
suggestion regarding framing of issues.  
7.    
In the present case, despite the fact that it 
was noted by the courts below that petitioner had not 
taken plea of estoppel in his written statement, the 
petitioner never applied for amendment of his 
pleadings and without applying for the same is 
raising plea of framing of additional issue, which 
according to the opinion of the learned trial court 
does not arise in the matter.  It is not the vested right 
of a party to stress for framing of a particular issue if 
such a plea is not raised through its pleadings and 
where the court is convinced that the same does not 
arise from the pleadings or any other material 
available on the record, the said court can refuse to 

 
W.P. No. 27318 of 2023 
7 
 
frame the issue requested to be framed by a party. 
This court is cognizant of the fact that the trial court 
should frame all the issues required for proper 
determination of dispute pending before it yet this 
court in its constitutional jurisdiction would not 
ordinarily interfere in the concurrent findings 
recorded by the courts below, whereby both the 
courts have concluded that the question of framing of 
additional issue relating to estoppel does not arise 
from the pleadings of the parties and this Court has 
no reason to conclude otherwise.  
8.   
Even otherwise as the statement was got 
recorded by respondent No. 3 on 09.02.2019 during 
the pendency of the suit, the court can always take 
into consideration the effect of the said statement 
while finally deciding the matter as court is 
competent to determine all the matters pending 
adjudication before it while also taking into 
consideration the effect of changed circumstances in 
order to meet the ends of justice. Reliance in this 
regard is placed on PLD 2008 Supreme Court 85 
(Rana MUHAMMAD HAYAT KHAN versus Rana 
IMTIAZ AHMAD KHAN), PLD 2007 Supreme 
Court 52 (Hafiz HAMDULLAH versus SAIFULLAH 
KHAN and others) and PLD 1978 Supreme Court 
220 (Mst. AMINA BEGUM AND OTHERS versus 
Mehar GHULAM DASTGIR) 
9.  
The afore-referred findings of the trial court 
and observations by the learned Addl. District Judge, 
Kasur, up-holding the decision of the civil court are 
well reasoned and do not suffer from any misreading, 
non-reading, illegality or jurisdictional defect for this 
Court to warrant any interference in the same.

For what has been discussed above, this 
constitutional petition being devoid of any merits is 
dismissed.
