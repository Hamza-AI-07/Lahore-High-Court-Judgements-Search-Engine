MIRZA VIQAS RAUF, J. This petition under Article 199 of 
the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 assails the 
vires of order dated 06th October, 2023, whereby the Ex-Officio 
Justice of Peace, Rawalpindi proceeded to direct the Station House 
Officer (SHO) Police Station Dhamial, Rawalpindi to record 
statement of 
respondent No.2 (hereinafter referred to as 
“respondent”) under Section 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
1898 (hereinafter referred to as “Cr.P.C.”) and to proceed further in 
accordance with law. 

Writ Petition No.3343 of 2023

2. 
Facts forming background of this petition are that the 
“respondent” moved a petition under Section 22-A/22-B of the 
“Cr.P.C.” stating therein that initially he moved an application to 
respondent No.7 complaining the commission of offence by the 
petitioner but he turned deaf hear. It is asserted that though the 
petitioner voiced his grievance before respondents No.3 to 6 but 
remained unsuccessful. While proceeding with the petition under 
Sections 22-A/22-B of the “Cr.P.C.” the Ex-Office Justice of Peace 
requisitioned a report from the concerned police, which was 
accordingly submitted. On receipt of report and after hearing the 
parties the Ex-Officio Justice of Peace passed the impugned order.  
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the matter in 
issue relates to enforcement of contractual obligations. He added that 
though the “respondent” initially moved an application to respondent 
No.7 but it was not disclosing commission of any cognizable 
offence. It is argued with vehemence that the Ex-Officio Justice of 
Peace proceeded in a mechanical manner. Learned counsel submitted 
that civil litigation is already pending between the petitioner and the 
“respondent” but he converted the same into criminal one. 
Emphasized that the impugned order is not tenable being illegal and 
unlawful. In support of his contentions, learned counsel placed 
reliance on JAMAL KHAN versus SECRETARY HOME DEPARTMENT (2021 
SCMR 468) and YOUNAS ABBAS and others versus ADDITIONAL SESSIONS 
JUDGE, CHAKWAL and others (PLD 2016 Supreme Court 581). 
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the “respondent”, while 
defending the impugned order submitted that criminal and civil 
litigation can go side by side. He added that the petitioner while 
using the heavy machinery demolished the room constructed upon 
the plot by the “respondent”. It is contended that the Ex-Officio 
Justice of Peace was justified in the circumstances to direct 
respondent No.7 to proceed in terms of Section 154 of the “Cr.P.C.”. 
5. 
Learned Law Officer also argued in support of the impugned 
order. 

Writ Petition No.3343 of 2023

6. 
Heard. Record perused. 
7. 
It is an admitted position on the record that the “respondent” 
initially moved the application available at page No.15 of this 
petition to respondent No.7. From perusal of the application it clearly 
reveals that the petitioner was not named therein. The application 
also comprises of bald and general allegations. It is also an 
undeniable fact that the petitioner and “respondent” are entangled in 
litigation before the Civil Court. There is no cavil that Ex-Officio 
Justice of Peace is vested with the power to direct the police to 
proceed in terms of Section 154 of the “Cr.P.C.” if some cognizable 
offence is apparently made out from the allegations leveled by the 
petitioner in application under Section 22-A of the “Cr.P.C.”. 
8. 
As already observed that initially the “respondent” moved an 
application to respondent No.7 which was founded on general and 
bald allegations and the petitioner was even not named in the said 
application as perpetrator of the alleged offence. On receipt of 
petition under Section 22-A/22-B of the “Cr.P.C.” Ex-Officio Justice 
of Peace requisitioned report from the police wherein it is mentioned 
that the dispute interse petitioner and “respondent” is relatable to 
land and no such incident as reported by the “respondent” has taken 
place. 
9. 
It is trite law that functions performed by the Ex-Officio 
Justice of Peace under Section 22-A of the “Cr.P.C.” are quasi-
judicial in nature and it cannot be termed as executive/administrative 
or ministerial. At the same time powers exercised by the Ex-Officio 
Justice of Peace are neither unbridled nor indefinite. While 
exercising powers under Section 22-A(6) of the “Cr.P.C.” the Ex-
Officio Justice of Peace is not supposed to proceed mechanically and 
in vacuum. After requisitioning a report from the police, Ex-Officio 
Justice of Peace is not expected to brush aside such report without 
assigning any lawful reasoning. In the case of YOUNAS ABBAS and 
others versus ADDITIONAL SESSIONS JUDGE, CHAKWAL and others (PLD 
2016 Supreme Court 581), while examining the scope of sub-section 

Writ Petition No.3343 of 2023 
-4- 
 
(6) of Section 22-A of the “Cr.P.C.” the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
laid down certain guidelines for the Ex-Officio Justice of Peace. The 
relevant extract from the same is reproduced below :- 
“2……….In such a milieu, powers given to an ex-officio 
Justice of the Peace under subsection (6) of Section 22-A, 
Code of Criminal Procedure, to issue appropriate directions on 
a complaint filed by an aggrieved person for registration of a 
criminal case (Clause-i) and for transfer of investigation from 
one police officer to another (Clause-ii) though efficacious and 
expeditious besides being at the doorstep, but at the same time, 
these provisions should not be unbridled or open-ended. These 
provisions must be defined, structured and its contour 
delineated to obviate misuse by influential and unscrupulous 
elements. Therefore:-  
(i) The ex-officio Justice of the Peace, before issuance of a 
direction on a complaint for the non-registration of a 
criminal case under subsection (6)(i) of section 22-A, Code 
of Criminal Procedure must satisfy himself that sufficient 
material is available on the record, such as application to 
the concerned SHO for registration of the criminal case and 
on his refusal or reluctance, complaint to the higher police 
officers i.e. DPO, RPO etc., to show that the aggrieved 
person, before invoking the powers of ex-officio Justice of 
the Peace, had recourse to the high ups in the police 
hierarchy. 
(ii) So far as transfer of investigation of a criminal case 
from one police officer to another police officer is 
concerned, a complete mechanism has been provided in the 
Police Order, 2002. 
 However, Clause (ii) of Subsection (6) of Section 22-A, Code 
of Criminal Procedure has given power to the ex-officio Justice 
of the Peace to issue appropriate direction to the concerned 
police authorities for the transfer of investigation of a case 
from one police officer to another, but it does not prescribe a 
criterion or mechanism in so many words as to what might be 
the standard or what reasons should prevail with the ex-officio 
Justice of the Peace while issuing such a direction. To issue a 
direction regarding transfer of investigation by ex-officio 
Justice of the Peace without taking into consideration the 
attending circumstances of the case may be counter-productive 
and may defeat the purpose of the mechanism as provided in 
the Police Order, 2002, thus may result into unnecessary 
interference with the working of an agency. Therefore, it would 
be appropriate for the ex-officio Justice of the Peace, before 
issuance of any direction regarding the change of investigation, 
to satisfy himself from the available record that the grievance 
of the aggrieved person (who has filed the application for this 
purpose) 
has 
not 
been 
redressed 
by 
the 
Police 
Officers/authorities as provided in the Police Order, 2002.” 
After having an overview of the principles laid down in the judgment 
supra when the order of the Ex-Officio Justice of Peace is examined 
on the touchstone of said principles, there remains no hint of doubt 

Writ Petition No.3343 of 2023 
-5- 
 
that the Ex-Officio Justice of Peace failed to adhere the well-
recognized principles. 
10. 
Perusal of petition under Section 22-A/22-B of the “Cr.P.C.” 
reveals that it is lacking any detail of alleged incident. There is no 
cavil to the proposition that civil and criminal proceedings can move 
side by side but one cannot be allowed to shift the civil liability into 
criminal one. Prima facie there is property dispute interse the 
“respondent” and the petitioner for the resolution of which they have 
already approached the Civil Court. In the circumstances the 
“respondent” is precluded to resort to the Ex-Officio Justice of Peace 
under Sections 22-A & 22-B of the “Cr.P.C.”. Even otherwise 
impugned order is completely non-speaking. Guidance in this respect 
can be sought from RAI ASHRAF and others versus MUHAMMAD SALEEM 
BHATTI and others (PLD 2010 Supreme Court 691) and JAMAL KHAN 
versus SECRETARY HOME DEPARTMENT (2021 SCMR 468). 
11. 
For the foregoing reasons, this petition is allowed, 
consequently impugned order dated 06th October, 2023 passed by the 
Ex-Officio Justice of Peace, Rawalpindi is set aside being illegal and 
unlawful with no order as to costs.
