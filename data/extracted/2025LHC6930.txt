Case No. W. P. No. 43188 of 2023 
 
Sayed Arshad Shah etc. 
Versus 
Addl. District Judge etc. 
 
                  JUDGMENT  
 
Date of Hearing: 
28.11.2025. 
Petitioners by: 
Mr. 
Shoaib 
Akram 
Bhalli, 
Advocate. 
Respondent Nos. 3 
and 4 by: 
Ch. Ali Hassan Jajja, Advocate. 
 
FAISAL ZAMAN KHAN, J. Through this petition, 
order and judgment dated 31.05.2022 and 23.05.2023 passed 
by respondent Nos. 2 and 1 respectively have been assailed. By 
virtue of the former order an application filed by respondent 
Nos. 3 and 4 for the custody of the minor has been allowed and 
through the latter judgment the same has been upheld. 
2. 
The facts giving rise to the present petition are that 
respondent Nos. 3 and 4 are the real parents of Sayed Wafa 
Abbas (minor) who is at present about 13 years of age. 
Admittedly, the custody of the said minor was handed over by 
respondent Nos. 3 and 4 to the petitioners as they are closely 
related (petitioner No.1 and respondent No.4 are real brothers). 
Subsequent thereto on 04.03.2022, an application seeking 
custody of the minor was filed by respondent Nos. 3 and 4 
against the petitioners, in which the latter filed their reply. Out 
of divergent pleadings of the parties 03 issues were framed. 
Evidence pro and contra was led, whereafter through order 

W. P. No. 43188 of 2023                                                            2 
 
dated 31.05.2022 the application was allowed, however, a 
schedule was chalked out for meeting of the minor with the 
petitioners. Feeling aggrieved, petitioners filed an appeal 
which was dismissed through judgment dated 23.05.2023, 
therefore, this petition. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that out of 
their own sweet will and accord respondent Nos. 3 and 4 
handed over the custody of the minor to the petitioners at the 
time of his birth, so that the petitioners can raise the said child 
as their own, therefore, at this belated stage when the minor is 
fully adjusted with the petitioners considering them to be his 
parents, there is no circumstance to hand over the custody of 
the minor to respondent Nos.3 and 4, thus both the courts 
below erred in law in allowing the application for custody of 
the minor.    
4. 
Replying to the above, learned counsel for respondent 
Nos. 3 and 4 submits that as a temporary arrangement the 
custody of the minor was handed over to the petitioners when 
he was about 06 months old, however, this by no mean would 
give a preferential right to the petitioners to retain the custody 
of the minor especially when his real parents (respondent Nos. 
3 and 4) are alive and are ready to raise him.  He further 
submits that the minor is not being brought up in a proper 
manner by the petitioners therefore the custody of the minor 
has rightly been handed over to respondent Nos. 3 and 4 by the 
courts below. Places reliance on judgments reported as Mrs. 
Shaukat Khalid v. Additional District Judge, Rawalpindi and 2 
others (1991 SCMR 19), Waqar Haider Butt v. Judge, Family 
Court and others (2009 SCMR 1243), Muhammad Shamim Ali 
v. Mst. Asma Begum and others (2024 SCMR 1642) and Mst. 
Bakhat Bibi v. Bhadur Ali and others (2015 CLC 1260).   

W. P. No. 43188 of 2023                                                            3 
 
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
6. 
While dilating upon the proposition in hand this has to 
be kept in view that a minor who at the time of birth or 6 
months after his birth (as contrary stance has been taken by the 
parties) was handed over by respondent Nos.3 and 4 (actual 
parents) of their own sweet will to the petitioners (foster 
parents) and the latter set of parents have been upbringing him 
for 09 long years (when the custody petition was filed as now 
the minor is about 13 years of age) without any complaint from 
the actual parents and one fine morning the minor has been 
bombarded with the news that he is not the child of the 
petitioners and is in fact an off spring of respondent Nos.3           
and 4. Imagine the plight, the state of mind and the emotion 
distress of the minor who has been living with the family 
consisting of mother, father and 06 sisters and a brother (foster 
family) considering them to be his actual family, that they are 
not related to him and is actually the child of respondent No.3 
and 4 having 13 brothers and sisters (actual family). 
7. 
While interpreting Section 17 of the Guardians & Wards 
Act, 1890 (Act) which spells out the guidelines for appointing 
a person as a guardian, it has been held by the Supreme Court 
of Pakistan in judgments reported as Raja Muhammad Owais 
v. Mst. Nazia Jabeen and others (2022 SCMR 2123), Mst. 
Beena v. Raja Muhammad and others (PLD 2020 S. C. 508), 
Rashid Hussain v. Additional District Judge, Islamabad (East) 
and others (PLD 2022 S.C. 32), Mir Bat Khan v. Mst Sherin 
Bibi and others (2019 SCMR 520), Shabana Naz v. 
Muhammad Saleem (2014 SCMR 343), Mehmood Akhtar v. 
District Judge, Attock and 2 others (2004 SCMR 1839), 
Badruddin Roshan v. Mst. Razia Sultana and another (2002 
SCMR 371) and Mst. Nighat Firdous v. Khadim Hussain 

W. P. No. 43188 of 2023                                                            4 
 
(1998 SCMR 1593) that the primary and the foremost 
consideration for taking a decision qua custody of minor is 
his/her welfare.  
8. 
The cumulative reading of the above judgments would 
show that there are many factors, which are required to be 
considered by the courts for determining the welfare of the 
minor, which include the age, sex and religion of the minor, 
character and capacity of the proposed guardian, his/her 
nearness of the kin with the minor, wishes, if any, of the 
deceased parents (if the parents of the minor are not alive) and 
the existing relationship of the proposed guardian with the 
minor. Apart from the above, the court can consider the 
intelligent preference of the minor, if the minor is old enough. 
It has also been held in the above judgments that the courts 
while determining the welfare of the minor can ignore the fact 
that father is the natural guardian or the mother has the right 
of Hizanat. 
9. 
In addition to the above, while interpreting Section 17 of 
the Act, in a latest judgment dated 16.05.2025 passed by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in CRP No.458 of 2024 in CPLA 
No. 2514 of 2014 titled “Dr. Muhammad Asif v. Dr. Sana 
Sattar and others”, the Supreme Court has emphasized a lot on 
the concept that the ‘voice of the child’ and ‘the preference 
given by the child that with whom he/she wishes to reside’ 
has to be seriously considered while deciding the cases of the 
custody of the minor so that his/her best interest can be 
protected. It has also been observed that listening to a child 
does not mean obeying him/her rather understanding his/her 
perspective deeply enough to act in his/her best interest.   
10. 
Keeping in view the afore referred case law, the peculiar 
circumstances of the present case and the preferential right of 

W. P. No. 43188 of 2023                                                            5 
 
the parties, the minor, who is about 13 years of age was asked 
to appear before this Court on 29.10.2025 upon which he was 
posed questions to weigh his mental state and intelligent 
preference which were answered by him ably and during the 
course of his deposition he in unequivocal and clear terms has 
shown his willingness and desire to reside with the petitioners. 
At that point in time, the custody of the minor was temporarily 
handed over to respondent Nos. 3 and 4 by this Court for a 
week’s time so that minor gets a chance to live with his actual 
parents so that he can make an intelligent preference, 
subsequent to which the custody of the minor was returned to 
the petitioners on 07.11.2025 and today when the minor 
appeared before this Court in person, he was again asked that 
which set of parents he wishes to reside with, upon which he 
again in unequivocal and clear terms deposed that he wishes to 
reside with the petitioners.  
11. 
It shall be apposite to observe here that the confidence 
and the maturity which the child has shown while deposing 
before this Court is commendable especially keeping in view 
the circumstances mentioned in paragraph No.6 supra which 
would reflect that he has been brought up well by the 
petitioners. 
12. 
In view of the afore noted facts, keeping in view the 
peculiar circumstances of the case and listening to the voice of 
the minor, this Court is of the view that Sayed Wafa Abbas 
(minor) is of impressionable age and since he has shown his 
willingness to live with the petitioners especially so when 
respondent Nos.3 and 4 of their own sweet will and accord 
handed over his custody to the petitioners and have not been 
able to show any circumstances to establish that the minor is 
not being brought up in congenial circumstances, the courts 

W. P. No. 43188 of 2023                                                            6 
 
below erred in law in ignoring these facts and especially the 
voice of the child whose welfare is of paramount 
consideration, despite the fact that it had categorically been 
mentioned in paragraph No.17 of the order passed by 
respondent No.2 that the minor appeared before the said court 
and made a unequivocal statement that he wishes to live with 
the petitioners, deliberately ignored the voice of the minor 
without assigning any reason that why such voice should not 
be heard and awarded the custody of the minor to respondent 
Nos.3 and 4. 
13. 
There is no cavil to the proposition that when a 
comparison is made between the real parents and the foster 
parents qua custody of the minor, the real parents have a 
preferential right, however and as discussed in the previous 
paragraphs, the primary consideration for determining the 
custody of the minor is his welfare and while determining the 
said factum, the courts below have completely ignored that 
respondent Nos. 3 and 4 have not been able to prove that the 
custody of the minor was temporarily handed over to the 
petitioners with a caveat that as and when a male child is born 
to the petitioners the custody of the minor will be handed over 
to them. Had this been the situation, at least the details must 
have been mentioned in the application for custody of the 
minor qua such arrangement i.e. in whose presence, where, 
when and what time such arrangement was made. Moreover 
they have also not been able to prove that the minor is not 
being brought up in congenial comfortable environment.   
14. 
Another aspect which has been ignored by the courts 
below is that respondent No.4 is a multi-married man having 
13 children out of three marriages and would it be safe to send 
the minor to such a big family who are all alien to him as 

W. P. No. 43188 of 2023                                                            7 
 
compared to the petitioners, 06 sisters and a brother with 
whom he has been living with for 13 years considering them to 
be his actual family and what will be his state of mind if one 
fine morning he is sent to an absolute alien atmosphere. They 
have also ignored the fact that admittedly son of respondent 
No.4 namely Shahbaz was married to daughter of the 
petitioners namely Sania and there is a matrimonial dispute 
between them and as a counterblast to that the application for 
custody of the minor has been filed.  
15. 
During the course of arguments, it was suggested by this 
Court to respondent Nos.3 and 4 that a schedule of meeting can 
be made by this Court for the said respondents to meet with the 
minor so that he can familiarize with them and if after some 
time the minor and the actual parents develop affinity, 
respondents can re-apply for the custody of the minor, however 
they refused the proposal. 
16. 
As regards the judgments cited by learned counsel for 
respondent Nos.3 and 4, the same being outcome of different 
facts and circumstances are not applicable to the case in hand.  
17. 
For what has been discussed above and keeping in view 
the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present case, this 
Court is of the view that the welfare of the minor lie with the 
petitioners and since both the courts below ignored the fact as 
enumerated in the previous paragraphs thus they erred in law 
in handing over the custody of the minor to respondent Nos. 3 
and 4, therefore, this petition is allowed, as a consequence to 
which the impugned order and judgment are set aside, 
resultantly the application for custody of the minor filed by 
respondent Nos. 3 and 4 stands dismissed. 

W. P. No. 43188 of 2023                                                            8 
 
18. 
Respondent Nos.3 and 4 are at liberty to approach the 
family/guardian court for chalking out a plan for meeting with 
the minor.
