Mr. Shakeel Javed Chaudhry, Advocate for the 
petitioner.  
 
 
 
The petitioner has invoked the constitutional 
jurisdiction of this Court under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, 
challenging the order & decree dated 24.09.2025 passed by 
learned Judge Family Court pursuant whereto the suit of 
respondent No.2 for dissolution of marriage on the basis of 
Khula was decreed.  
2. 
Tersely, necessary facts forming background of the 
proceedings in hand are that respondent No.2 instituted a 
suit for dissolution of marriage against the petitioner. The 
petitioner contested the suit by filing written statement in 
contrast whereby he maintained that at the time of marriage 
with him respondent No.2 concealed her earlier marriages 
and no valid Talaq or decree for dissolution of marriage was 
obtained by her, hence, the marriage between the parties 
was void ab initio, therefore, no question of dissolution on 

W.P. No.14118 of 2025.  
2
the basis of Khula arises. During the pre-trial reconciliation 
proceedings, respondent No.2 got recorded her statement 
that she had developed extreme hatred against the defendant 
(petitioner) and not intended to rehabilitate with him, 
therefore, suit for dissolution of marriage may be decreed. 
Similarly, petitioner also got recorded his statement 
whereby he deposed that he did not want to reconcile with 
the plaintiff (respondent No.2). Learned Trial Court, in the  
light of statements of the parties, dissolved the marriage on 
the basis of Khula vide order/decree dated 24.09.2025. 
Being dissatisfied, the petitioner has filed instant 
Constitutional Petition.   
3. 
Heard. Record perused.  
4. 
After hearing learned counsel for the petitioner and 
going through the record, it has been observed that the 
respondent No.2 prayed for dissolution of marriage on the 
basis of Khula as she had developed severe hatred against 
the petitioner, whereas, contrarily, stance of the petitioner 
was that the marriage was void ab initio as the respondent 
No.2 was earlier married and she contracted marriage with 
the petitioner without getting any decree for dissolution of 
marriage/Khula from her previous husband.  
5. 
In the absence of any documentary proof furnished 
by the petitioner to substantiate the allegation that 
respondent No.2’s earlier marriages were subsisting at the 
time of their marriage, the learned Family Court proceeded 

W.P. No.14118 of 2025.  
3
on the basis that the marriage between the parties was duly 
solemnized, a fact admitted by both sides. The petitioner 
neither produced certified copies of any alleged previous 
Nikahnamas nor any evidence showing that respondent 
No.2 remained legally bound in any earlier wedlock. A 
mere bald assertion, unsupported by documentary or oral 
evidence, cannot displace the strong legal presumption of 
validity that attaches to an admitted marriage. It is also 
well-settled that the pendency of a separate declaratory suit, 
filed by the petitioner to challenge the validity of the 
nikahnama, does not bar the jurisdiction of the Family 
Court to dissolve a marriage that continues to subsist unless 
and until set aside by a competent court. As long as the 
relationship of husband and wife exists on record, the wife’s 
statutory and Islamic right to seek dissolution on the basis 
of khula remains intact and enforceable. 
6. 
It 
is 
now 
firmly 
entrenched 
in 
Pakistani 
jurisprudence, particularly after the landmark judgment in 
"Khurshid Bibi v. Baboo Muhammad Amin" (PLD 1967 SC 
97), that when a wife states on oath that she cannot live 
with her husband within the limits prescribed by Allah and 
that she has developed aversion or hatred towards him, the 
Court is obliged to accept her statement and grant khula. 
Such a statement, especially when made before the Court 
during reconciliation proceedings, leaves no scope for 
judicial discretion to deny relief. In the present case, 

W.P. No.14118 of 2025.  
4
respondent No.2 expressly stated that reconciliation was 
impossible and that she could not live with the petitioner. 
This, in itself, was sufficient grounds for the Family Court 
to dissolve the marriage. 
7. 
A more compelling factor is that the petitioner 
himself stated that he did not wish to reconcile with 
respondent No.2. Once both parties have categorically 
refused reconciliation, the very basis of matrimonial life i.e. 
mutual willingness, companionship, and harmony has 
collapsed. A court of law is not expected to keep alive a 
matrimonial tie that both spouses have rejected. The 
institution of marriage in Islam is based on tranquility, 
affection, and mercy. When these essential elements are 
absent, and when the wife asserts extreme aversion while 
the husband is also unwilling to keep her, compelling 
continuation of such a union would amount to perpetuating 
emotional and psychological hardship. No principle of 
Islamic law, statutory law, or equity permits forcing a wife 
to remain in a marriage she no longer wishes to continue, 
particularly when the husband also expresses unwillingness 
to live with her. To insist on continuation of such a 
marriage would not only defeat the objectives of 
matrimonial life but would also contradict Islamic 
jurisprudence, which emphasizes ease, justice, and 
prevention of harm. 

W.P. No.14118 of 2025.

8. 
In light of these factors, the learned Family Court 
committed no legal flaw or jurisdictional error in dissolving 
the marriage on the basis of khula subject to surrender of 
whole prompt and deferred dower, particularly when both 
parties agreed that reconciliation was not possible and when 
the petitioner failed to substantiate his allegations regarding 
previous subsisting marriages of respondent No.2. The 
impugned judgment reflects correct appreciation of law, 
established jurisprudence, and the factual matrix of the case. 
9. 
So far as the contention of the petitioner that he has 
challenged the Nikahnama by instituting a declaratory suit 
is concerned, it suffices to observe that the said suit is 
pending adjudication before the Court of competent 
jurisdiction, which shall determine the validity or otherwise 
of the Nikahnama strictly in accordance with law and on the 
basis of evidence that may be produced before it. The 
pendency of that suit has no bearing upon the present 
proceedings, nor does it suspend the subsisting marital 
status of the parties for the purposes of deciding the 
question of khula, especially when the marriage has been 
admitted and no competent forum has yet declared it void. 
10. 
For the foregoing reasons, learned Family Court has 
rightly passed order dated 24.09.2025 by dissolving the 
marriage on the basis of Khula. Learned counsel for the 
petitioner remained unable to point out any illegality, 
irregularity, jurisdictional defect or infringement of 

W.P. No.14118 of 2025.

fundamental right. Hence, this petition is dismissed-in-
limine, being devoid of any force/substance.
