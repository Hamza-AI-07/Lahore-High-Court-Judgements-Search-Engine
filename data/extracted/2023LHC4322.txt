For the Appellant:

Advocate.

Rana Muhammad Imran Anjum, Deputy 
Prosecutor General. 
 
 
Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – On 11.6.2004, Akhtar 
Hussain (PW-12) (hereinafter referred to as the “Complainant”) 
appeared before the SHO, Police Station Civil Lines, Lahore, and 
stated that he was serving as a Research Officer in WAPDA. When he 
arrived at the WAPDA House for duties in the morning, he met Abdul 
Rehman (Director, C.A.D.). The latter proceeded to his office while 
he went to Room No.214 to see Director Abdul Jalil Ibrar. The 
gentleman had not yet arrived, but PW Zafar Iqbal, Assistant Director, 
was present. Meanwhile, another Assistant Director, Iqbal Ansari  
(the Appellant), came and inquired whether Abdul Jalil was on leave. 
PW Zafar Iqbal informed him that he was not and would be in the 
office shortly. The Appellant left, and after some time, Abdul Jalil 
arrived. Around 8:35 a.m., fire shots were heard from Abdul 
Rehman’s office, and the news came that the Appellant had injured 
him. A few minutes later, the Appellant stormed into Room No.214, 
holding a pistol. He yelled at Abdul Jalil that he would teach him a 
lesson for having him transferred and then shot him dead. According 
to the Complainant, the Appellant committed the offence because he

- 2 - 
suspected that Abdul Jalil and Abdul Rehman had complained against 
him, upon which the WAPDA authorities had posted him away. The 
SHO reduced the Complainant’s statement to writing and, based on 
that complaint (Exh. PE), FIR No. 463/2004 dated 11.6.2004  
(Exh. PE/1) was registered under sections 302, 324 PPC and section 7 
of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 (the “ATA”). 
2. 
 
When the Appellant was in judicial lock-up, his relatives 
applied for the constitution of a medical board, stating that he had lost 
his mental balance and was unfit to stand trial. On 3.9.2004, without 
waiting for the medical evaluation, the Special Judge, Anti-Terrorism 
Court, Lahore, indicted him. Subsequently, when he received the 
board’s report confirming that the Appellant was unfit, he suspended 
further proceedings in the case, directing it to examine him 
periodically and submit updates. On 28.3.2005, the Judge received the 
board’s report stating that the Appellant had regained health. 
Thereupon, he resumed the proceedings without a fresh indictment. 
He recorded the prosecution evidence and, at the conclusion of the 
trial, found him guilty and sentenced him to death. The High Court 
dismissed the Appellant’s appeal (Crl. Appeal No.1060 of 2006) and 
answered Capital Sentence Reference No. 32/T/2006 sent by the trial 
court under section 374 Cr.P.C. in the affirmative. The Appellant filed 
Crl. Appeal No. 703/2009 in the Supreme Court of Pakistan, which it 
decided vide judgment dated 16.11.2015. The Supreme Court 
remanded the case for a de novo trial because the Appellant was 
mentally incompetent when the Special Judge indicted him on 
3.9.2004. He was required to frame the charge against him afresh 
when he resumed proceedings on 28.3.2005 after the board’s 
certification that he could face the trial. Since he did not do so, he 
committed an incurable irregularity which vitiated the trial. 
3. 
 
In the post-remand proceedings, on 22.8.2016, the 
Special Judge framed the charge against the Appellant afresh, to 
which he pleaded not guilty. The Special Judge then recorded 
evidence and, on the completion of the trial, convicted and sentenced 
him by judgment dated 25.10.2016 as under: 

Crl. Appeal No.2066/2016 
 
- 3 - 
(i) 
Convicted under section 7(a) of the ATA and sentenced to 
imprisonment for life with a fine of Rs.100,000/- payable to 
the legal heirs of Abdul Jalil Ibrar deceased and, in case of 
default thereof, he shall undergo further imprisonment for 
six months. 
(ii) 
Convicted under section 7(b) of the ATA and sentenced to 
rigorous imprisonment for ten years with a fine of 
Rs.50,000/- payable to Abdur Rehman (the injured person) 
and, in case of default thereof, he shall undergo further 
imprisonment for four months. 
(iii) 
Convicted under section 7(h) of the ATA and sentenced to 
rigorous imprisonment for five years with a fine of 
Rs.10,000/- and, in case of default thereof, he shall undergo 
further imprisonment for five months. 
  
 
The Special Judge ordered that the Appellant’s sentences 
shall run concurrently and extended him the benefit of section 382-B 
Cr.P.C. 
4. 
 
The Appellant has challenged his conviction and 
sentence before this Court through the instant appeal. 
5. 
 
When we took up this appeal, Ch. Muhammad Jawad 
Zafar, Advocate, informed us that the Appellant had relapsed into his 
mental ailment. We directed the Medical Superintendent, Punjab 
Institute of Mental Health, Lahore (PIMH), to form a medical board to 
evaluate his health. The board has reported that the Appellant suffers 
from schizoaffective disorder and is unfit to face legal proceedings. 
Consequently, the question has arisen whether we should decide this 
appeal in the current situation. 
6. 
 
Ch. Zafar states that the Appellant is receiving therapy 
but is in bad shape. This Court should adjourn the hearing of this 
appeal until he is well enough. The Deputy Prosecutor General has, 
however, opposed this suggestion. He contends that section 465 
Cr.P.C. applies only at the trial stage. No legal impediments prevent 
this Court from ruling on this appeal. 
7. 
 
We have heard the counsel and examined the record. We 
start our discussion on the issue with sections 464 and 465 Cr.P.C., 
which read as follows: 
464. 
Procedure in case of accused being lunatic.– (1) When a 
Magistrate holding an inquiry or a trial has reason to believe that 
the accused is of unsound mind and consequently incapable of 
making his defence, the Magistrate shall inquire into the fact of 
such unsoundness, and shall cause such person to be examined by 

Crl. Appeal No.2066/2016 
 
- 4 - 
the Civil Surgeon of the district or such other medical officer as the 
Provincial Government directs, and thereupon shall examine such 
surgeon or other officer as a witness, and shall reduce the 
examination to writing. 
(1A) 
Pending such examination and inquiry, the Magistrate may 
deal with the accused in accordance with the provisions of section 
466. 
(2) 
If such Magistrate is of the opinion that the accused is of 
unsound mind and consequently incapable of making his defence, 
he shall record a finding to that effect and shall postpone further 
proceedings in the case. 
465. 
Procedure in case of person sent for trial before Court 
of Session or High Court being lunatic.– (1) If any person before 
a Court of Session or a High Court appears to the Court at his trial 
to be of unsound mind and consequently incapable of making his 
defence, the Court shall, in the first instance, try the fact of such 
unsoundness and incapacity, and if the Court is satisfied of the 
fact, it shall record a finding to that effect and shall postpone 
further proceedings in the case. 
(2) 
The trial of the fact of the unsoundness of mind and 
incapacity of the accused shall be deemed to be part of his trial 
before the Court. 
8. 
 
Section 464 Cr.P.C. deals with the proceedings before a 
Magistrate, while section 465 Cr.P.C. relates to the trials before the 
Court of Session and the High Court. A Larger Bench of the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan recently explained these provisions in Mst. Safia 
Bano and another v. Home Department, Government of the Punjab, 
and others (PLD 2021 SC 488). True, a bare perusal thereof indicates 
that they only apply to inquiries or trials. If the issue of the convict’s 
soundness of mind and incapacity arises before the High Court at the 
appellate stage, since there is no specific provision dealing with that 
situation, it may, at its discretion, take one of the following courses: 
(i) it may determine the fact of such unsoundness and incapacity itself 
following the procedure specified in section 465 Cr.P.C. and 
elucidated in Safia Bano’s case, or (ii) it may refer the matter to the 
Court of Session/Special Court concerned for determination according 
to the same principles, or (iii) it may direct the Medical 
Superintendent, PIMH, to form a medical board and seek a report 
from it. The High Court would decide on the options considering the 
facts and circumstances of each case. 
9. 
 
In the present case, there is credible evidence that the 
Appellant has been intermittently suffering from a mental condition 

Crl. Appeal No.2066/2016 
 
- 5 - 
for the past 18 years. The question before this Court is whether he is 
fit at this time when his appeal is fixed for hearing. In the 
circumstances, the report from the medical board from PIMH suffices. 
There is no need for an inquiry of the sort described in section 465 
Cr.P.C. 
10. 
 
Should the decision on the Appellant’s appeal be 
postponed in light of the medical board’s certification of his 
disability? 
11. 
 
In 
Vivian 
Rodrick 
v. 
State 
of 
West 
Bengal,  
(1969) 3 SCC 176, Vivian Rodrick was charged under sections 302 
and 148 of the Indian Penal Code and section 5 of the Explosive 
Substances Act. His trial was delayed because medical reports showed 
he was of unsound mind. It commenced when his condition gradually 
improved and he could make his defence. Eventually, he was 
convicted and sentenced. He filed an appeal, but his mental illness 
recurred in the meantime. While he was still in that condition, the 
High Court heard and decided on his appeal, maintaining his 
conviction and sentence. The Indian Supreme Court set aside the 
judgment holding as under: 
“28. 
Whatever may be the legal position regarding the 
applicability of section 465 Code of Criminal Procedure to appeals, 
we are not inclined to agree with the proposition enunciated by the 
learned Judges [of the High Court] that there is no bar to ‘hearing 
and disposing of an appeal, even if the Accused-Appellant is of 
unsound mind or even insane at the time when the appeal is taken 
up for hearing’… 
“29. 
In our opinion, when the report is that an Accused-
Appellant is of unsound mind, it is reasonable to infer that he is 
incapable of making his defence, and the Court, in the 
circumstances, is bound to afford him the same protection to which 
he would have been entitled had he been of unsound mind at the 
time of the trial. 
“30. 
We may refer, in this connection, to the decision of the 
Calcutta High Court in Sundaram v. State (MANU/WB/0249/1958 
: ILR 1959 2 Cal 465) which lays down that even if Chapter 
XXXIV of the Code of Criminal Procedure may not apply to an 
appeal, nevertheless the Court has inherent power to postpone the 
hearing of the appeal until such time as the Appellant should be 
found to be of sound mind again and thus capable of making his 
defence. We are of the opinion that the distinction sought to be 
made of this decision, in the order of the Appellate Bench, dated 
July 19, 1967 in the present case, is not justified, whatever may be 
the position regarding the applicability or otherwise of Chapter 
XXXIV to appeals.” 

Crl. Appeal No.2066/2016 
 
- 6 - 
12. 
 
In Vivian Rodrick’s case, the Indian Supreme Court 
observed that if a convict’s appeal is heard while he is of unsound 
mind, he may be prejudiced and result in a failure of justice. To 
illustrate this point, the Indian Supreme Court stated that during the 
hearing of the appeal, the court may think it necessary to take 
additional evidence. Or, circumstances may arise in which the convict 
must request permission to present additional evidence. In such 
situations, the convict would be unable to give appropriate 
instructions to his lawyer or put essential questions to the witness 
himself. 
13. 
 
In State of Maharashtra v. Sindhi @ Raman  
(AIR 1975 SC 1665), the Additional Sessions Judge sentenced the 
respondent-convict to death for double murder. He did not file any 
appeal, but the trial judge submitted a reference to the High Court for 
the confirmation of the death sentence. The High Court postponed the 
proceedings in the reference because the convict became insane. The 
State filed an appeal before the Supreme Court of India inter alia 
contending that (i) section 465 of the Indian Code of Criminal 
Procedure (which is pari materia with our section 465 Cr.P.C.) is 
limited to the trial stage and does not apply to the proceedings before 
the High Court on reference since they are post-trial proceedings,  
(ii) the accused has no right of audience in a reference. The Supreme 
Court dismissed the appeal holding as under: 
“… so far as an accused person sentenced to death is concerned, 
his trial does not conclude with the termination of the proceedings 
in the Court of Session. The reason is that the death sentence 
passed by the Court of Session is subject to confirmation by the 
High Court. A trial cannot be deemed to have concluded until an 
executable sentence is passed by the competent court. Viewed 
from that standpoint, the confirmation proceedings under sections 
374, 375 and 376, Chapter XXVII of the Code of 1898, are, in 
substance, a continuation of the trial. Nor is it correct to say that in 
such confirmation proceedings, the High Court can arbitrarily 
refuse to hear the accused either in person or through counsel or 
another agent.” 
14. 
 
The principle of law that emerges from the above-
mentioned cases is that a convict may be prejudiced if the Appellate 
Court rules on his appeal while he is of unsound mind because doing 
so denies him the right to a hearing. The same thing happens when the 

Crl. Appeal No.2066/2016 
 
- 7 - 
High Court decides a reference under section 374 Cr.P.C. regarding 
such a person. Therefore, the High Court/Appellate Court should 
postpone the hearing of the appeal and/or the reference when the 
convict is mentally incapacitated. However, we may qualify this 
statement by adding that the court may proceed if the case is such that 
the convict would be acquitted. 
15. 
 
Applying the above principles, we adjourn this appeal 
until the Appellant recovers and can present his case. The 
Superintendent, Central Jail, Lahore, shall take the Appellant to the 
Medical Superintendent, PIMH, every two months. He shall have him 
examined by a medical board, which will submit its report to this 
Court through the Deputy Registrar (Judicial). This appeal shall be 
fixed immediately after receiving a favourable report on him. 
16. 
 
The Appellant has filed Writ Petition No.37412/2020 to 
get his sentence suspended. We would deal with it separately. The 
directions in the preceding paragraph shall be subject to any orders in 
that petition.
