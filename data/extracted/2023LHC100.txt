Aashiq Hussain 
Versus 
Fida Hussain & others

Date of hearing:    24.01.2023. 
Petitioner by: 
Mr. Muhammad Ihsan Gondal, Advocate.  
Respondents by: 
Mr. Muhammad Ashraf Saggu, Advocate. 
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.: Through 
instant petition, petitioner has called into question order dated 
10.12.2019 & judgment dated 20.01.2020, passed by learned Civil 
Judge and Additional District Judge, Darya Khan, respectively, 
whereby petitioner’s application for comparison of thumb 
impressions / signatures of witnesses namely Ghulam Muhammad 
(DW-7) and Madah Hussain (DW-8) was concurrently dismissed.  
 
2. 
Learned counsel for petitioner submits that once a party 
denies execution of a document, it is for the other party to get 
comparison of the signatures or thumb impressions with that of 
appearing on the document. Further submits that expert opinion on 
the question whether the documents or statements are signed by 
same person is relevant fact within the contemplation of Article 59 
of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, thus, petitioner’s application 
is liable to be accepted. Contends that learned Courts below have 
not rightly appreciated the applicable law and failed to exercise 
jurisdiction vested in them, hence, impugned decisions are 
unsustainable in the eye of law. He has relied upon Ghulam Haider 
v. Fateh Muhammad (2005 MLD 1501), Mst. Nusrat Bibi v.

Writ Petition No.6404 of 2020 
Muhammad Ashraf Mehr and others (2007 YLR 41), Sarfraz v. 
Khizer Hayat and another (2008 YLR 818) and Muhaar v. 
Muhammad Yousaf and others (2010 MLD 1745). 
 
3. 
Contrarily, learned counsel for respondents defends the 
impugned orders.  
 
4. 
Arguments heard and available record perused.   
 
5. 
Admittedly, petitioner and respondents are legal heirs of 
deceased Muhammad Ramzan. In suit, respondents / plaintiffs 
challenged the veracity and authenticity of different mutations 
executed by predecessor-in-interest of the parties in favour of 
petitioner / defendant. Under the law, a beneficiary of the 
document(s) is required to establish valid execution of the 
transaction(s) in his favour by producing attesting / marginal 
witnesses. In a situation, where the thumb-impressions / signatures 
of the executant or witness of a document are denied, a person 
pleading positivity of the thumb impressions / signatures will be 
under a heavy burden to prove the same by seeking comparison 
with the admitted thumb impressions / signatures. Reference can be 
made to Mst. Nusrat Bibi v. Muhammad Ashraf Mehr and others  
(2007 YLR 41), Abdul Haq and others v. Iftikhar Ahmad and 
others (2017 MLD 1792) and Shabbir Ahmed and others v. 
Cholistan Development Authority and others (2020 CLC 243). 
 
6. 
In the instant case, petitioner / defendant is the beneficiary of 
the disputed mutations and in evidence, he produced Ghulam 
Muhammad as DW-7, who categorically denied to have attested the 
disputed mutations and signed the same. Whereas, DW-8, Madah 
Hussain also refuted attestation of the mutations and existence of 
his thumb impressions thereon. In such eventuality, it was duty of 
petitioner to apply to the Court for getting thumb impressions / 
signatures of aforesaid witnesses compared from an expert, which 
he duly performed but his request was declined. In case of failure to 
opt such course by a party / beneficiary, there might be a 
presumption against him that had the thumb impressions / 

3 
Writ Petition No.6404 of 2020 
signatures of aforesaid witnesses been got compared from the 
expert, the report would have received against him. Guidance can 
also be sought from the cases reported as Wali Muhammad Khan 
and another v. Mst. Amina and others (2018 SCMR 2080) and 
Nazir Abbas through L.Rs. v. Ghulam Muhammad through L.Rs. 
(2017 CLC 996). 
 
7. 
It is well-established by now that the Courts must take liberal 
view regarding acceptance of request for comparison of signatures / 
thumb impressions, as there is no express provision in law to 
decline such request. Moreover, report of the expert will tend to 
supplement the evidence of either party enabling the Court to reach 
just and correct decision and pronounce a balanced judgment. 
Learned Courts below have failed to exercise jurisdiction vested in 
them under the law on an unjustified ground. The observation of 
learned Trial Court that this exercise would linger on the 
proceedings is misconceived as there will be no harm to any party 
rather it will be appropriate and imperative to reach a just and 
proper conclusion even at the cost of some delay. It is a right of a 
party to seek and demand every possible assistance from the Courts 
of law and to hold him/her responsible only when he or she is found 
to have acted contrary to law. The interest of justice can only be 
safely dispensed after the signatures and thumb impressions of 
aforesaid witnesses are got verified from the expert. Reference is 
made to Mst. Akhtar Begum v. Muslim Commercial Bank Ltd. (2009 
SCMR 264), Syed Sharif Ul Hassan through L.Rs. v. Hafiz 
Muhammad Amin and others (2012 SCMR 1258), Zafar Ullah 
Khan v. Mst. Hakim Bibi and another (2000 YLR 2789), Talib 
Hussain v. Additional District Judge etc. (PLJ 2014 Lahore 193), 
Syed Akbar Hussain through L.Rs. and another v. Mst. Naziran 
Begum and another (2014 CLC 1760) and Lal Din v. Muhammad 
Saleem (deceased) through L.Rs. and others (2019 CLD 894). 
 
8. 
In view of the above, instant petition is allowed and 
impugned orders passed by learned Courts below are declared to be

Writ Petition No.6404 of 2020 
illegal and without lawful authority and set aside. Petitioner’s 
application for comparison of thumb impressions / signatures of 
witnesses namely Ghulam Muhammad (DW-7) and Madah Hussain 
(DW-8) is accepted. Learned Trial Court is directed to do the 
needful expeditiously and decide the suit within two months after 
the receipt of report of the expert, even if it is to be heard on day-to-
day basis.
