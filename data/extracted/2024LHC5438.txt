MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J. / CHAIRMAN:- 
Through instant appeal, appellant has assailed vires of order / 
letter dated 02.02.2016, issued by respondent, whereby 
appellant’s request for grant of proforma promotion as 
Additional District & Sessions Judge was declined due to 
adverse remarks in his PER for the period from 01.01.2009 to 
06.05.2009. 
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that vide Notification dated 
06.04.2010, as many as eight Senior Civil Judges were 
promoted as Additional District & Sessions Judges on 
officiating basis, however the appellant was deferred due to 
adverse remarks in his PER for the period from 01.01.2009 to 
06.05.2009. Later on, appellant was promoted as Additional 
District & Sessions Judge vide Notification dated 15.12.2014, 
however with immediate effect. Appellant challenged letter 
dated 24.08.2010, whereby adverse remarks in the PER of 
afore-referred period were communicated, by filing Service 
Appeal No.08 of 2011, which was disposed of vide judgment 
dated 22.01.2016 with the observation that if there existed no 

 
Service Appeal No.01 of 2016 
2 
adverse entry in PERs of next three years from 07.05.2009, the 
adverse remarks appearing in PER for the period from 
01.01.2009 to 06.05.2009 would not stand in the way to 
consider appellant for further promotion. Pursuant to said 
decision, appellant approached respondent with the request to 
grant him proforma promotion from the date when the next 
junior Judicial Officer to him was promoted as Additional 
District & Sessions Judge. However, his request was declined 
by way of impugned order / letter dated 02.02.2016, which is 
under-challenged through this appeal. 
3. 
Learned counsel for appellant submits that when a civil 
servant is deferred for promotion and his batch-mates are 
promoted, his subsequent promotion must be from the date 
when his juniors were promoted and esteemed judgments of 
Hon’ble superior Courts on the subject have been ignored while 
declining appellant’s request for grant of proforma promotion. 
He has relied upon Deputy Inspector-General of Police, 
Gujranwala and others v. Anwar Saeed, Inspector Police and 
others [1997 PLC (C.S.) 584] and Managing Director (Power), 
WAPDA and others v. Muhammad Luqman (PLD 2003 
Supreme Court 175). 
4. 
Contrarily, learned Legal Advisor of respondent defends 
the impugned order and submits that adverse remarks in the 
PER became hurdle in his way to next promotion at relevant 
time. He adds that owing to adverse remarks, appellant cannot 
claim to have flawless and unblemished service record and 
proforma promotion is granted on the basis of clean service. He 
further submits that colleagues of appellant were promoted on 
officiating basis subject to assumption of charge of the post, 
therefore, appellant was not eligible at that time owing to 
adverse remarks in his PER, therefore, he cannot claim 

 
Service Appeal No.01 of 2016 
3 
proforma promotion from the date when his colleagues were 
promoted.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused.  
6. 
The sole allegation / excuse for not granting promotion to 
appellant as Additional District & Sessions Judge from due date 
i.e. 06.04.2010 is the adverse remarks appearing in his PER for 
a period of almost 04-months commencing from 01.01.2009 to 
06.05.2009, legality and validity of the adverse remarks 
recorded therein are not the issues to be determined by us. 
However, the respondent has not shown to us if there are any 
adverse entries in the PER(s) of the appellant prior or after the 
afore-referred period. It is also not the claim of respondent that 
appellant was even otherwise not eligible for promotion at the 
relevant time.  
7. 
A perusal of the record shows that the appellant agitated 
the matter regarding the adverse remarks in his PER by filing 
Service Appeal No. 08 of 2011, which was disposed of by a 
judgment dated 22.01.2016, referencing a ruling of the Hon'ble 
Administration Committee of the High Court dated 24.05.2014. 
In that ruling, it was resolved that adverse remarks concerning 
the integrity of an officer could be ignored, provided he earned 
three consecutive satisfactory PERs. Undeniably, the appellant 
successfully met the condition of earning three consecutive 
satisfactory PERs and thereby overcame the hurdle. Therefore, 
he has the right to be considered for proforma promotion from 
the date when his juniors were promoted. In cases where a 
temporary embargo has been placed on a civil servant’s right to 
promotion, or legal restraint has been imposed on his/her claim, 
the removal of such obstacles entitles the officer to remedy the 
monetary loss and loss of rank through proforma promotion. 
There is no dispute with the proposition that it is an inalienable 
right of every civil servant to be considered for promotion along 

 
Service Appeal No.01 of 2016

with his batchmates once he fulfills the eligibility criteria. 
Reliance is placed upon Abdul Jabbar Khan v. Government of 
Sindh through Chief Secretary, Karachi and 5 others (1996 
SCMR 850), Chairman, State Life Insurance Corporation of 
Pakistan, Karachi and others v. Siddiq Akbar (2013 SCMR 
752), Chief Secretary, Sindh v. Riaz Ahmed Massan and 
another (2016 SCMR 1784), Arshad Ali v. WAPDA and others 
[2020 PLC (C.S.) 1226] and Wadhu Mal v. Province of Sindh 
through Principal Secretary Chief Minister and 3 others [2023 
PLC (C.S.) 1310]. 
8. 
The argument of the learned counsel for the respondent, 
that the promotion of the appellant (w.e.f. 15.12.2014) as well 
as his colleagues (w.e.f. 06.04.2010) was on an officiating 
basis, subject to assumption of charge, and that the appellant 
cannot claim proforma promotion from the said date, is 
misconceived. No doubt, an officiating promotion is inherently 
temporary, intended for situations where posts are vacant due to 
deputation, suspension, or leave of the incumbent, and does not 
confer a substantive right to the promoted position. However, in 
the instant case, the promotion of the appellant’s colleagues as 
Additional District & Sessions Judges was made in accordance 
with the eligibility criteria for substantive posts, after 
fulfillment of all legal requirements, and their promotion was 
not rescinded at any subsequent stage. Officiating promotions 
cannot permanently preclude civil servants from receiving 
proforma promotions if they satisfy all criteria and their juniors 
have been promoted to substantive posts. The Punjab Judicial 
Service Rules, 1994, mandate that promotions to posts such as 
Additional District and Sessions Judges must adhere to the 
principles of seniority-cum-fitness. The appellant, having 
fulfilled the necessary conditions for promotion, is entitled to 
proforma promotion from the date his juniors were promoted. 

 
Service Appeal No.01 of 2016

These rules ensure transparency and fairness in promotions, 
protecting the rights of senior officers. Needless to say, an 
appointment by promotion on an officiating basis, under Rule 
13(1) of the Punjab Civil Servants (Appointment & Conditions 
of Service) Rules, 1974, can be made against posts that fall 
vacant due to the circumstances mentioned in the said Rule. We 
specifically asked the learned Legal Advisor for the respondent 
whether the posts against which the appellant’s colleagues were 
promoted had fallen vacant as a result of any of the situations 
mentioned in Rule 13(i) of the said Rules. He frankly conceded 
that this was not the case, and that the respondents were 
promoted against regular vacancies. It is further noted that, vide 
Notification dated 21.04.2010, the posting and transfers of the 
appellant’s colleagues were made, requiring them to assume 
charge of their new place of posting on or before 26.04.2010, 
without passing any fresh order for their regular promotion, and 
they assumed charge accordingly. 
 
Even otherwise, the issue has been settled by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case reported as Secretary to 
Government of Punjab, Communication and Works Department 
v. Muhammad Khalid Usmani & others [2017 PLC (C.S.) 373], 
wherein it has been observed that the device of officiating 
promotion is used by government departments to keep civil 
servants under their influence, which creates a constant source 
of insecurity, uncertainty, and anxiety for them. Such a practice 
should be discouraged. It was further observed that promotion 
on an officiating basis should be resorted to only under the 
circumstances outlined in Rule 13(i) ibid. 
9. 
Needless to say, the principle of proforma promotion 
seeks to ensure fairness in cases where administrative 
inefficiency or procedural delays result in a senior civil servant 
being bypassed. Adverse ACRs, once resolved or mitigated 

 
Service Appeal No.01 of 2016

through subsequent satisfactory reports, lose their impact on the 
civil servant’s promotion eligibility. Officiating promotions 
cannot permanently preclude civil servants from receiving 
proforma promotion if they satisfy all criteria and their juniors 
have been promoted to substantive posts. Failure to grant 
proforma promotion in such cases would contravene the 
principles of fairness and equity. 
10. 
In view of the above, instant appeal is allowed. 
Consequently, impugned order / letter dated 02.02.2016 is set 
aside with the observations that Departmental Authorities 
should proceed to consider the case of appellant for proforma 
promotion in accordance with law.
