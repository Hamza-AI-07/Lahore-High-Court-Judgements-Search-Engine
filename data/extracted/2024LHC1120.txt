MUHAMMAD ALTAF and another 
JUDGMENT 
Date of hearing:  
 
29.02.2024 
Petitioner by: 
Mr. Shahryar Tariq, Advocate. 
Respondent No.1 by: 
Mr. Muhammad Masroof Ch, 
Advocate. 
Respondent No.2 by: 
Nemo. 
 
MIRZA VIQAS RAUF, J. The petitioner herein namely 
Muhammad Azram claiming himself the son of Mst. Zar Begum 
instituted a suit for declaration seeking cancellation of mutations 
No.1946 dated 24th June, 1996 and 2394 dated 21st March, 2006 with 
the averments that Mst. Zar Begum his mother was owner in 
possession of land measuring 02 Kanal 08 Marla situated within the 
revenue estate of Samote Tehsil Kallar Syedan District Rawalpindi 
(hereinafter referred to as “suit land”). It is asserted that respondent 
No.1 (hereinafter referred to as “respondent”) being the resident of 
same vicinity having influence upon the revenue officials succeeded 
in attestation of mutation No.1946 dated 24th June, 1996 in his 
favour showing that he purchased the “suit land” from the mother of 
the petitioner with sale consideration of Rs.1,00,000/-. It is averred 
that the transaction of mutation was kept concealed and after the 

Civil Revision No.573-D of 2014 
-2- 
 
afflux of time, “respondent” further alienated the “suit land” through 
gift mutation No.2394 in favour of respondent No.2, which are 
ineffective upon his rights. It is further averred that on raising the 
claim qua the “suit land” by respondent No.2, the petitioner became 
acquainted with the impugned mutations and thus instituted the suit. 
Suit was resisted by “respondent”, who submitted his written 
statement and defended the mutations in question. On the other hand, 
respondent No.2 was proceeded against ex-parte, on his failure to 
appear before the court. From the pleadings of the contesting parties 
multiple issues were framed by the trial court whereafter evidence of 
both the sides was recorded and suit was ultimately decreed with 
costs vide judgment dated 03rd December, 2010. Feeling dissatisfied 
the “respondent” preferred an appeal before the learned Additional 
District Judge, Rawalpindi, which was allowed by way of judgment 
and decree dated 05th December, 2013, which is now impugned in 
this petition under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure (V of 
1908) (hereinafter referred to as “C.P.C.”).  
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that mother of 
the petitioner was a “Pardahnasheen” lady. He added that 
“respondent” being clever person succeeded in obtaining the sale 
mutation in his favour depriving the petitioner from the legacy of his 
mother. Learned counsel contended that on attaining the knowledge 
about the impugned mutations, the petitioner immediately instituted 
the suit, which was initially decreed through a well-reasoned 
judgment passed by the learned Civil Judge. Emphasized that the 
appellate court while setting at naught the judgment of the trial court 
has grossly misread the evidence. It is contended with vehemence 
that the appellate jurisdiction has been exercised illegally and the 
impugned judgment and decree is not tenable under the law. Learned 
counsel submitted that question of limitation has wrongly been dealt 
with by the learned Additional District Judge. In order to supplement 
his contentions, learned counsel placed reliance on FAQIR ALI and 
others versus SAKINA BIBI and others (PLD 2022 Supreme Court 85), 
GHULAM FARID and another versus SHER REHMAN through LRs. (2016 

Civil Revision No.573-D of 2014 
-3- 
 
SCMR 862) and REHMATULLAH and others versus SALEH KHAN and others 
(2007 SCMR 729). 
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for “respondent” submitted that 
sale mutation was validly sanctioned. He added that suit was barred 
by time as the possession of the “suit land” was delivered to the 
“respondent” at the time of attestation of sale mutation which was in 
knowledge of the petitioner. Learned counsel contended that while 
decreeing the suit, learned Civil Judge has completely misread the 
evidence. He added that the appellate court has rightly interfered 
with the judgment of the trial court and the impugned judgment is 
unexceptionable. Placed reliance on Mst. FAHEEMAN BEGUM 
(DECEASED) through L.Rs and others versus ISLAM-UD-DIN (DECEASED) 
through L.Rs and others (2023 SCMR 1402).  
4. 
Heard. Record perused. 
5. 
Mst. Zar Begum, mother of the petitioner was the owner of the 
“suit land” which was alienated in favour of the “respondent” 
through mutation No.1946. Perusal whereof reveals that sale was in 
lieu of consideration of Rs.1,00,000/-. Mutation was sanctioned on 
24th June, 1996. It is an admitted fact that Mst. Zar Begum took her 
last breath on 11th October, 2003. The petitioner instituted the suit on 
09th March, 2007 with the averments that he is in possession of the 
“suit land” and was not aware of any of the mutations in question. 
Contrary to this the “respondent” took the stance that he purchased 
the “suit land” after payment of sale consideration and possession 
was also handed over to him in pursuance thereof.  
6. 
In order to prove his claim, the petitioner himself appeared as 
PW1 and while recording his statement departed from the pleadings 
and stated that possession of “suit land” was though initially with 
him but now respondent No.2 has constructed a house upon the 
same. It also reflects from the statement of petitioner that he himself 
also sold land measuring 07 Marla to the “respondent”. In addition 
thereto, the petitioner also examined Muhammad Suleman as PW2. 
The statement of this witness is quite relevant to comprehend the 
matter in issue. The relevant extract from the same is reproduced 
below :- 

Civil Revision No.573-D of 2014

7. 
In the wake of above discussion, it becomes obligatory for the 
petitioner to first cross the hurdle of limitation. Suit for declaration 
of a right or title is to be instituted by the person seeking declaration 
of any right as to any property in terms of Section 42 of the Specific 
Relief Act, 1877. The limitation of a suit under the above mentioned 
provision is to be regulated and governed by Article 120 of the 
Limitation Act, 1908 which provides six years period for such suit, 
which starts when the right to sue accrues. The petitioner pleaded 
that he attained the knowledge about the mutation in question after 
incorporation of gift mutation in favour of respondent No.2 by 
“respondent”. It is also asserted by the petitioner in his plaint that he 
is in possession of the “suit land”, which fact is though seriously 
refuted by the “respondent” in his written statement. In the course of 
evidence, the petitioner himself deposed that the possession is not 
with him but it is with respondent No.2, who raised the construction 
upon the “suit land” as well. In furtherance thereof, Muhammad 
Suleman (PW2) admitted that at the time of incorporation of entries 
in Khasra Girdawari in the name of the “respondent”, he when 
asked the Halqa Patwari as to why the entries are in the name of 
“respondent” he told him that the “suit land” no more exists in the 
name of petitioner. During his cross-examination he further clarified 
that the entries in the Khasra Girdawari were recorded 2/3 years 
prior to the death of mother of the petitioner in his house and at that 
time “respondent”, Mukhtar and Muhammad Aslam were present 
there. He also stated that at the time of recording of entries in Khasra 
Girdawari he affirmed from “respondent” about the purchase of the 
“suit land”. This leaves no doubt to infer that at the time of sale the 
possession was delivered to the “respondent”.  

Civil Revision No.573-D of 2014

8. 
Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 ordains that any 
person entitled to any legal character, or to any right as to any 
property, may institute a suit against any person denying, or 
interested to deny, his title to such character or right, and the court 
may in its discretion make therein a declaration that he is so entitled. 
Section 42 of the Act ibid is reproduced below for the purpose of 
convenience :- 
“42. Discretion of Court as to declaration of status or 
right.— Any person entitled to any character or any right to 
any property, may institute a suit against any person denying, 
or interested to deny, his title to such character or right and the 
Court may in its discretion make therein a declaration that he is 
so entitled, and the plaintiff need not in such suit ask for any 
further relief: 
Bar to such declaration. Provided that no Court shall make 
any such declaration where the plaintiff, being able to seek 
further relief that a mere declaration of title, omits to do so.” 
In the case of SALAMAT ALI and others versus MUHAMMAD DIN and 
others (PLD 2022 Supreme Court 353) the Supreme Court of Pakistan, 
while outlining the scope of Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act, 
1877 held as under :- 
“25. 
A suit for declaration of any right as to any property 
is filed under section 42 of the Specific Relief Act 1877 
("Specific Relief Act"). Therefore, to ascertain when the 
right to sue accrues to a legal heir to seek a declaration of his 
ownership right over the property inherited by him and of 
his such right not to be affected by the further transfer of 
such property, we need to consider section 42 of the Specific 
Relief Act, which reads:-- 
42. Discretion of Court as to declaration of status or 
right-- Any person entitled to any legal character, or to any 
right as to any property, may institute a suit against any 
person denying, or interested to deny, his title to such 
character or right, and the Court may in its discretion make 
therein a declaration that he is so entitled, and the plaintiff 
need not in such suit ask for any further relief: 
Provided that no Court shall make any such declaration 
where the plaintiff, being able to seek further relief than a 
mere declaration of title, omits to do so. 
(Emphasis added) 
It becomes evident by reading the above provisions that the 
right to sue accrues to a person against the other for 
declaration of his right, as to any property, when the latter 
denies or is interested to deny his such right. It thus 
postulates two actions that cause the accrual of right to sue, 
to an aggrieved person: (i) actual denial of his right or (ii) 
apprehended or threatened denial of his right. 
26. 
What "actions" can be termed as an "actual denial of 
right", and what a mere "apprehended or threatened denial of 
right", in the context of adverse entries recorded in the 

Civil Revision No.573-D of 2014 
-6- 
 
revenue record, is a question that requires consideration. 
Admittedly, entries in the revenue record do not create or 
extinguish proprietary rights. Such an entry may at most be 
termed as a mere "apprehended or threatened denial" of 
right, and not an "actual denial" of right. Accordingly, every 
new adverse entry in the revenue record relating to 
proprietary rights of a person in possession (actual or 
constructive) of the land regarding which the wrong entry is 
made, gives to such person, a fresh cause of action to 
institute the suit for declaration. The situation is, however, 
different in a case where the person in possession (actual or 
constructive) of the land regarding which the wrong entry is 
made, is ousted from such possession, besides a wrong entry 
in the revenue record. In such a case, the act of ousting him 
from the actual or constructive possession of the land, 
constitutes an "actual denial" of his rights, and does not 
remain a mere "apprehended or threatened denial". 
Therefore, in such a case, if the person injuriously affected 
by such an act of "actual denial" of his rights does not 
challenge the same within the prescribed limitation period, 
despite having knowledge thereof, then his right to do so 
becomes barred by law of limitation. 
27. 
In an inheritance case, like the present one, a wrong 
mutation in the revenue record, as to inheritance rights does 
not affect the proprietary rights of a legal heir in the 
property, as the devolution of the ownership of the property 
on legal heirs takes place under the Islamic law, through 
inheritance immediately, without any formality including 
sanction of inheritance mutation. Therefore, a wrong 
mutation is a mere "apprehended or threatened denial" of 
right, not necessitating for the person aggrieved thereby to 
institute the suit. The position is, however, different when 
the co-sharer in possession of the joint property, on the basis 
of a wrong inheritance mutation, sells the joint property, or 
any part thereof exceeding his share, claiming him to be the 
exclusive owner thereof and transfers possession of the sold 
land to a third person, the purchaser. In such a circumstance, 
the co-sharer by his said act "actually denies" the rights of 
the other co-sharer, who is only in constructive possession of 
the same, and ousts him from such constructive possession 
also by transferring the possession of the sold land to a third 
person, the purchaser. In such circumstances, the right to sue 
accrues to the aggrieved co-sharer from the date of such sale, 
and transfer of actual possession of the sold land to the third 
person, the purchaser.” 
9. 
Right to sue accrues to a person against the other for 
declaration of his right, as to any property, when the latter denies or 
is interested to deny his such right. As already observed that 
possession of the “suit land” lies with the “respondent” since 
effecting of sale mutation in the year 1996, suit of the petitioner thus 
cannot be termed as within time. Guidance to this effect can be 
sought from Haji MUHAMMAD YUNIS (DECEASED) through legal heirs 
and another versus Mst. FARUKH SULTAN and others (2022 SCMR 1282). 
The relevant extract from the same is reproduced below :- 
“It has held that every new adverse entry in the revenue 

Civil Revision No.573-D of 2014 
-7- 
 
record, being a mere "apprehended or threaten denial" 
relating to proprietary rights of a person in possession 
(actual or constructive) of the land regarding which the 
wrong entry is made, gives to such person a fresh cause of 
action to institute the suit for declaration. It has, however, 
further clarified that the situation is different in a case, 
where the beneficiary of an entry in the revenue record 
actually takes over physical possession of the land on the 
basis of sale or gift mutation. In such a case, the alleged 
wrong entry in the revenue record coupled with the very act 
of taking over possession of the land by the alleged buyer or 
donee, in pursuance of the purported sale or gift, is an 
"actual denial of the proprietary rights" of the alleged seller 
or donor and thus, the time period to challenge the said 
disputed transaction of sale or gift by the aggrieved seller or 
donor would commence from the date of such actual denial. 
Therefore, in such a case, if the purported seller or donor 
does not challenge that action of "actual denial of his right" 
within the prescribed limitation period, despite having 
knowledge thereof, his right to do so becomes barred by the 
law of limitation, and the repetition of the alleged wrong 
entry in the subsequent revenue record (Jamabandt) does not 
give rise to a fresh cause of action.” 
10. 
In the case of Mst. RABIA GULA and others versus MUHAMMAD 
JANAN and others (2022 SCMR 1009) the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
while dealing with similar proposition held as under :- 
“8.15 The situation is, however, different in a case where the 
beneficiary of an entry in the revenue record also takes over 
the possession of the land on the basis of sale or gift 
transaction, as the case may be, recorded in that entry. His 
action of taking over possession of the land in pursuance of 
the purported sale or gift is certainly an "actual denial” of 
the proprietary rights of the purported seller or donor. 
Therefore, in such a case, if the purported seller or donor 
does not challenge that action of "actual denial” of his right, 
within the prescribed limitation period, despite having 
knowledge thereof, then his right to do so becomes barred by 
law of limitation.” 
11. 
So far judgment in the case of Faqir Ali’s heavily relied by 
learned counsel for the petitioner is concerned, it is noticed that in 
the said case by way of gift mutation female members of the family 
were deprived from their share in inheritance of their predecessor. 
They instituted a suit for declaration alleging fraud and were 
ultimately succeeded to establish that the gift mutations were the 
product of fraud. In this background, Supreme Court of Pakistan 
observed that fraud vitiates even the most solemn transactions and 
any transaction that is based upon fraud is void and notwithstanding 
the bar of limitation. Courts would not act as helpless by stands and 
allow a fraud to perpetuate. Needless to observe that facts in the 

Civil Revision No.573-D of 2014 
-8- 
 
cases of GHULAM FARID and another versus SHER REHMAN through LRs. 
(2016 SCMR 862) and REHMATULLAH and others versus SALEH KHAN and 
others (2007 SCMR 729) runs on altogether different premises and as 
such the principles laid therein are not attracted to the case at hand.  
12. 
There is yet another important aspect that sale was made in 
favour of the “respondent” by mother of the petitioner namely Mst. 
Zar Begum and she remained alive till 11th October, 2003 but never 
challenged the sale transaction in her lifetime. It is nowhere pleaded 
by the petitioner that his mother was not aware of the sale mutation 
in question and thus she could not challenge during her lifetime. The 
petitioner remained mum for a considerable period even after the 
death of her mother. On the contrary ample evidence is available to 
show that the petitioner was well in knowledge of the sale mutation 
from its inspection but waited for a long time to institute the suit, 
which is clearly hit by limitation. Reference to this effect can also be 
made to Mst. FAHEEMAN BEGUM (DECEASED) through L.Rs and others 
versus ISLAM-UD-DIN (DECEASED) through L.Rs and others (2023 SCMR 
1402). 
13. 
Moving further it is noticed that though the petitioner asserted 
that he is in possession of the “suit land” but in his statement he 
conceded that the possession of the “suit land” lies with respondent 
No.2 as such he is precluded to claim a decree of declaration as 
owner of the “suit land” unless relief of possession is sought. The 
relief of declaration is an equitable and discretionary relief. It 
appears that the petitioner twisted some material facts and produced 
only anecdotal evidence in support thereof which made him 
ineligible to claim the relief of declaration. Reliance in this respect 
can be placed on MUHAMMAD AKRAM through L.Rs. versus Mst. NOOR 
BEGUM through L.Rs. and others (PLD 2019 Supreme Court 599).  
14. 
This petition is though arising out of divergent views of the 
courts below as the conclusion are contrary to each other but this 
Court, while exercising revisional jurisdiction is supposed to make 
comparative analysis of both the judgments in order to determine 
their validity on the touchstones of Section 115 of “C.P.C.”. It is 
cardinal principle of law that in the matter of giving preference to the 

Civil Revision No.573-D of 2014 
-9- 
 
judgments of lower courts, while analyzing the same in exercise of 
revisional jurisdiction, the preference and regard is always given to 
the findings of the appellate court, unless those are suffering with 
any legal infirmity or material irregularity. Reference in this respect, 
if needed can safely be made to the case of MUHAMMAD NAWAZ 
through L.Rs versus Haji MUHAMMAD BARAN KHAN through L.Rs. and 
others (2013 SCMR 1300). Relevant extract from the same is 
reproduced herein below:- 
“12………We have also taken into consideration the judgment 
of the Appellate Court which is based on proper appraisal of 
evidence on record and the findings of the Appellate Court are 
to be preferred as it has been held by this Court in the cases of 
Madan Gopal and others vs Maran Bepari and others (PLD 
1969 SC 617) that if the findings of fact reached by the first 
appellate Court is at variance with that of the trial Court, the 
former will ordinarily prevail, although it would not possess 
the same value or sanctity as a concurrent finding.” This view 
also finds support from the cases of Muhammad Shafi and 
others vs. Sultan Mahmood and others (2010 SCMR 
827)……..” 
The above view also finds support from the cases of AMJAD IKRAM 
versus Mst. ASIYA KAUSAR and 2 others (2015 SCMR 1), MUHAMMAD 
HAFEEZ and another versus DISTRICT JUDGE, KARACHI EAST and another 
(2008 SCMR 398) and Mst. SAEEDA through her son Muhammad Abid versus 
MUHAMMAD NAEEM and 3 others (PLD 2013 Sindh 39). 
15. 
After having a comparative analysis of both the judgments, I 
am of the firm view that the learned Additional District Judge, 
Rawalpindi has rightly interfered with the judgment passed by the 
learned Civil Judge, Kallar Syedan. The petitioner has failed to point 
out any illegality or material irregularity in the impugned judgment, 
warranting interference by this Court in exercise of revisional 
jurisdiction so as to set at naught the impugned judgment. The 
instant petition thus fails and is dismissed with no order as to costs.
