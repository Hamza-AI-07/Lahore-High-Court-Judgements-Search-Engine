Ch. Muhammad Iqbal, J:-  Through this civil revision, 
the petitioner has challenged the validity of the judgment & 
decree dated 15.07.2009 passed by the learned District Judge, 
Jhelum whereby the appeal of the respondent was allowed, the 
judgment & decree dated 07.03.1993 passed by the learned Civil 
Judge, Jhelum was set aside and the suit for declaration filed by 
the petitioner was dismissed.  
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that on 04.01.1984 the 
petitioner/plaintiff filed a suit for declaration against the 
respondents/defendants and contended that the petitioner/plaintiff 
may be declared as owner of land measuring 18606 Kanal & 17 
Marla situated in village Rakh Dandot as per entries in the 
Jamabandi 1962-63, which land was transferred by the Central 
Government in favour of the petitioner/plaintiff and the 
respondents/defendants have no concern whatsoever with the suit 
Date of hearing

Respondents by 
 Mr. Jaleel Abbasi, Assistant Advocate General 
 Malik Abdul Razzaq, Assistant Advocate General

property and the entries in the Jamabani for the year 1966-1967, 
1970-1971, 1974-1975 and 1978-1979 in the ownership column 
showing Province of the Punjab as owner of the suit land may be 
declared as illegal and unlawful and said record may be corrected 
accordingly.  
 
The respondents/defendants filed contesting written 
statement and raised objection that mutation No.350 was got 
attested on 13.11.1968 by the Central Government in favour of 
the Provincial Government as such the suit is badly time barred. 
That the matter was referred to the Attorney General for Pakistan 
who announced award against the petitioner/plaintiff and the said 
Award dated 25.01.1982 was not challenged by the petitioner. 
That as per Section 49 of the West Pakistan Land Revenue Act, 
1967, the Provincial Government is owner of the suit property. 
As per divergent pleadings of the parties, the learned trial Court 
framed issues as under:- 
“1. 
Whether the plaintiff is owner in possession of the suit 
property? OPP 
2. 
Whether the entries in the revenue record are illegal, 
void and ineffective upon the plaintiff rights? OPP. 
 
3. 
Whether the suit is time barred? OPD. 
 
4. 
Whether the suit is barred by res judicata? OPD. 
5. 
Whether the suit has not been sufficiently stamped, if 
so its effect? OPD. 
 
6. 
Relief.  
After framing of the above issues, the petitioner/plaintiff 
produced in affirmative only the documentary evidence as  Ex.P1 
to Ex.P9 in the statement of its counsel who closed the right of 
leading affirmative evidence of the plaintiff on 04.07.1987. The 
respondent failed to produce evidence and their right to produce 
evidence was closed under Order XVII Rule 3 C.P.C on 
31.10.1987. Thereafter, the petitioner produced its Manager, 
Estate as PW-1 who got recorded his statement and also produced 
Ex.P10 to Ex.P15 in evidence. The learned trial Court on the 
basis of evidence of the petitioner/plaintiff decreed the suit vide 

 
C.R.No.506/2009 
 
3 
judgment & decree dated 25.11.1987. Being aggrieved, the 
respondent filed an appeal which was accepted vide judgment & 
decree dated 17.06.1990 by the learned appellate court who by 
setting aside the judgment & decree dated 25.11.1987 of the 
learned trial Court allowed the respondent/defendant to produce 
evidence.  
 
After remand, respondent produced Ex.D1 to D4 in 
evidence, thereafter, the learned trial Court again decreed the suit 
vide judgment & decree dated 07.03.1993. Being dissatisfied, the 
respondent preferred an appeal which was allowed vide judgment 
& decree dated 15.07.2009 by the appellate court who by setting 
aside the judgment & decree dated 07.03.1993 passed by the 
learned trial Court dismissed the suit of the petitioner. The 
petitioner challenged the decision of the appellate court through 
instant civil revision which was earlier dismissed by this Court 
vide judgment dated 30.05.2016. The petitioner assailed the said 
judgment of this Court through filing Civil Appeal No.2218 of 
2018 which was allowed on 12.09.2018 by the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan who remanded the matter to this Court to 
decide it afresh on merits. Hence the instant Revision Petition is 
being decided on merits.  
3. 
I have heard the arguments of learned counsels for the 
parties and have gone through the record with their able 
assistance. 
4. 
Onus to prove issue No.1 and 2 was upon the 
petitioner/plaintiff. In order to dislodge the above onus petitioner-
plaintiff produced documentary evidence comprising Ex.P1 to 
Ex.P9 in the statement of its counsel and closed the right of 
producing affirmative evidence on 04.07.1987. The said 
statement of counsel is as under:-

As after producing above evidences, the petitioner closed its 
affirmative evidence, thus the respondents were legally required 
to produce evidence but the respondent/defendant failed to lead 
evidence, as such their right of producing evidence was closed 
under Order XVII Rule 3 CPC on 31.10.1987. Despite there 
being non-availability of defence evidence and statement of the 
petitioner’s counsel for closure of affirmative evidence and 
without having permission from the trial court, the petitioner 
produced in evidence its Manager (Estate) namely Abdul Rahim 
(PW1) who tendered further documents Ex.P10 to Ex.P15 in his 
affirmative statement in absence of the learned counsel for the 
respondent and neither any opportunity of cross examination on 
the PW was given to the respondent nor the said witness ever 
appeared to face question of the opposite party as the learned 
petitioner’s counsel again closed right of petitioner’s evidence on 
08.11.1987 which statement of counsel is as under:- 
 ایبن ایک ہک اہشدت دمیع متخ رکات
وہں۔ 
 
 
 
 
 
 نس رک درتس میلست ایک۔ 
 
Thus, in absence of the opposite counsel, leading of evidence in 
clandestine manner without affording an opportunity of cross-
examination on the statement of PW-1 and also questioning the 
veracity of Ex.P-10 to Ex.P-15 vitiate legality of the said 
evidence.  

 
C.R.No.506/2009

5. 
As per revenue record, since 1962 till 1968, the land in 
question remained in ownership of the Central Government who 
provisionally 
transferred 
the 
management 
of 
the 
department/organization to the petitioner and the factum of 
transfer of land to the province superseded all the previous 
correspondence / letter of the Government with the petitioner. 
Further, the land in question was never allotted by any competent 
authority in favour of the petitioner nor its ownership has ever 
been transferred in favour of the petitioner. Thus, the plea of 
ownership of the petitioner is without any force.  
 
Further, it is worth mentioning here that the State land 
belonging to either Federal or Provincial Government is always 
maintained and managed by the Government Institution but none 
of such institution is absolute owner of it rather the title and 
ownership always remained with the concerned Government who 
has the authority under  the law to take away a chunk of land 
from its one institution / Department and assign the same to other 
Department and its intra Government assignee department is 
debarred to claim absolute ownership of said land, rather the 
Central Government being owner was competent to transfer the 
said land to the province. 
6. 
Moreover, the said land was transferred in favour of the 
Provincial 
Government 
through 
mutation 
No.350 
dated 
30.11.1968 and since then the ownership of Province of Punjab is 
reflected in the revenue record/ Jamabandis, which status is in 
field till date. Even otherwise, under Section 49 of the West 
Pakistan Land Revenue Act, 1967 the Provincial Government is 
owner of the mines and minerals. For ready reference, aforesaid 
provision is reproduced as under: 
 

 
C.R.No.506/2009 
 
6 
“49. Rights 
of 
Government 
in 
mines 
and 
minerals.–
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other law, or in 
any order or decree of Court or other authority, or in any rule of 
custom or usage, or in any contract, instrument, deed or other 
document, all mines and minerals shall be and shall always be 
deemed to have been the property of Government, and Government 
shall have all powers necessary for the proper enjoyment of its 
rights thereto.” 
 
The explanation of the word “Government” has been provided in 
the Punjab Laws (Adaptation) Order, 1974 which is as under: 
“Explanation – For the purposes of this section, “Government”, in 
relation to nuclear energy, mineral oil and natural gas, shall mean 
the Federal Government, and in relation to other mines and minerals 
the Government of the Punjab.” 
 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis supplied)  
After the enactment of the Act 1967 ibid the domain of Federal 
Government was limited to nuclear energy, mineral, oil and 
natural gas and rest of mine, mineral including the salt went into 
the jurisdiction/ ownership of Government of Punjab. Besides 
above in the changed legal scenario, the issue of ownership of 
suit land was also discussed in the Intra Provincial Conference 
held on 20.11.1979, and it was decided to refer the matter at 
discord to Attorney General for Pakistan who announced an 
award on 25.09.1982. According to the said award, the suit land 
is owned by the Provincial Government whereas the petitioner/ 
plaintiff can only excavate salt after obtaining license from the 
Provincial Government on payment of necessary lease money or 
royalty to it. For ready reference, the relevant portion of the 
Award is reproduced as under: 
“8. Having regard to Section 49 of the West Pakistan Land Revenue 
Act notwithstanding anything to the contrary or any other law salt 
would be deemed to have been the property of the Government of 
West Pakistan. The law here would include WPIDC, Ordinance 
XXXVIII of 1962. Even under the said Ordinance all that vested in 
the PIDC was right to do certain acts in the salt mines, it did not 
affect the proprietary rights of the Government. Be that as it may, 
even assuming if the contention to the contrary of the counsel of 
PMDC is correct, as has been stated earlier, in view of Section 49  
salt, being covered by expression, mine and mineral, sale mines are 
the property of the Government of Punjab, N.W.F.P who have all 
powers necessary for the proper enjoyment of the rights thereto. The 

 
C.R.No.506/2009 
 
7 
said statutory provisions are not affected by the Constitution of 
1973 and hence the contention of PMDC are devoid of force. 
9.  After giving the consideration to the written and oral submission 
of the parties and having regard to the legal provisions and all the 
circumstances, in my opinion, the PMDC can excavate salt in the 
Province after obtaining licence from the Provincial Government on 
payment of necessary lease money or royalty to them.” 
 
The above said Award was not challenged by the petitioners as 
such it has attained the status of finality and matter qua 
ownership of Province of Punjab has become past and closed 
transaction. Reliance is placed on Pakistan International Airlines 
Corporation Vs. Aziz ur Rehman Chaudhary and another (2016 
SCMR 14). 
7.  
Even 
otherwise, 
the 
petitioner/plaintiff 
produced 
affirmative evidence in the shape of documents Ex.P1 to 9 in the 
statement of its counsel on 04.07.1987. As per law the 
petitioner/plaintiff was required to tender documents in statement 
of its duly authorized person as per law but perusal of the record 
shows that the documentary evidence has been produced by the 
learned counsel of the petitioner/plaintiff in his statement which 
mode of tendering material documents in the evidence is not 
recognized as a valid tender of the documents in evidence and 
same wears no intrinsic value. The object of producing the 
material document by the party in its own statement is to afford a 
fair opportunity to the other party to cross-examine / question the 
veracity of the said document, as such the documents produced 
by the petitioner’s counsel cannot be relied upon as valid piece of 
evidence and ordinarily such documents are excluded from taking 
into consideration. Reliance is placed on the cases titled of Mst. 
Hameeda Begum & Others Vs. Mst. Irshad Begum & Others 
(2007 SCMR 996), Province of the Punjab through Collector, 
Sheikhupura & Others Vs. Syed Ghazanfar   Ali   Shah  &  Others  
( 2017 SCMR 172), Mst. Akhtar Sultana Vs. Major Retd. 
Muzaffar Khan Malik through his legal heirs and others (PLD 

 
C.R.No.506/2009 
 
8 
2021 SC 715) and Rustam & Others Vs. Jehangir (deceased) 
through LRs. (2023 SCMR 730). Furthermore, it is an 
astonishing fact that as the right of the respondents/defendants to 
produce evidence was closed on 31.10.1987, thereafter the 
petitioner/ plaintiff managed to get recorded the statement in 
affirmative of P.W.1 on 08.11.1987 and if any statement of 
witness so recorded or any document is produced after closure of 
right of leading evidence, such statement and documents are 
liable to be ignored. The same controversy has been resolved by 
the learned Division Bench of this Court in a case titled as 
Jameela Bibi & Others Vs Ahmadi Khanam & Others (2003 
YLR 369) wherein it is held as under:- 
“7…..The other marginal witness of the document 
Ch. Abdul Rahim, son of Noor Muhammad has not 
been examined by the appellants and no valid 
reason for this omission has been given, whereas 
Muhammad Aslam son of Jillal Din, other 
marginal witness was not examined in affirmative, 
rather he has been produced in rebuttal. We find 
that as the onus to prove valid execution of the 
agreement to sell in affirmative nature, was on the 
shoulder of the plaintiffs, therefore, examining this 
witness in rebuttal is not of any help to the 
appellants…..” 
 
 
 
Thus, this plea of the petitioner that the land was transferred to it 
along with its title is misconceived as the petitioner failed to 
prove its title qua the suit land and remained unsuccessful to 
dislodge the onus of the above issues through oral well as 
documentary evidence. 
8. 
The land in question is admittedly a public asset and the 
Courts of law are custodian of the public properties, public 
interest and while dealing with matters relating to such properties 
/ assets or interests, it is inalienable obligation of the courts to be 
very careful and cautious and assure itself to the extent of 
certainty that no foul is being played with the state assets. An 
extraordinary obligation is placed upon the courts to keep abreast 

 
C.R.No.506/2009 
 
9 
itself with law and facts of the case and when certain material 
facts unearthed before it then the matter should be decided as per 
law even without being influenced by respective pleadings of the 
parties. In this regard, reliance is placed on a judgment cited as 
Provincial Government through Collector, Kohat and another 
Versus Shabbir Hussain (PLD 2005 SC 337), wherein the 
Hon’ble Apex Court of the country has held as under:- 
 
“12. Likewise, the learned Presiding Officers are also required 
to exercise caution when they are dealing with matters relating 
to public property and public interest of which the Courts of 
law are the final custodians. It is true that we have never 
leaned in favour of giving of preferential treatment to the 
Government departments or agencies but then we are equally 
obliged, while granting relief, to ensure that public interest is 
not permitted to be jeopardized and public property is not 
allowed to be squandered through mere collusion of some 
representative of a Government agency”. 
 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
Further reliance is placed on cases cited as Al-shafique Housing 
Society Vs. P.M.A (PLD 1992 SC 113), Union Council Dhabeji 
Vs. Al-Noor Textile Mills Ltd (1993 SCMR 7), Multiline 
Associates Vs. Ardeshir Cowasjee (PLD 1995 SC 423), Abdul 
Haq Indher Vs. Province of Sindh (2007 SCMR 907), Taj 
Muhammad Vs. Town Committee (1994 CLC 2214) and Sindh 
Peoples Welfare Trust Vs. Government of Sindh (2005 CLC 
713). 
9. 
Admittedly the suit land was transferred by the Central 
Government in favour of the Provincial Government but the 
petitioner/plaintiff has not properly arrayed the aforesaid parties 
in the lis whereas it is settled law that in the absence of a 
necessary party, no effective decree or order can be passed. 
Reliance in this regard is placed on cases cited as Mst. Maqbool 
Begum etc. Vs. Gullan & Others (PLD 1982 SC 46), Province of 
the Punjab through Member Board of Revenue (Residual 

 
C.R.No.506/2009 
 
10
Properties), Lahore & Others Vs. Muhammad Hussain through 
LRs & Others (PLD 1993 SC 147), Dr. Saleem Javed & Others 
Vs. Mst. Fauzia Nasim & Others (2003 SCMR 965) and 
Government of Balochistan, CWPP&H Department & Others Vs. 
Nawabzada Mir Tariq Hussain Khan Magsi & Others (2010 
SCMR 115), Muhammad Siddique (Deceased) through L.Rs. and 
others Vs. Mst. Noor Bibi (Deceased) through L.Rs. and others 
(2020 SCMR 483) and Province of Punjab through Secretary 
Excise & Taxation Department, Lahore & Others Vs. Murree 
Brewery Company Ltd (MBCL) & Another (2021 SCMR 305). 
10.  
As regard the argument of learned counsel for the 
petitioner that the appeal of the respondents/defendants before the 
learned appellate Court was time barred, suffice it to say that as 
per record the appeal was instituted by the respondents/ 
defendants within time before the District Judge, Jhelum who 
returned the same due to lack of pecuniary jurisdiction, thereafter 
it was presented immediately before this Court and remained 
pending but subsequently due to enhancement of pecuniary 
jurisdiction of lower appellate court, it was transmitted back to 
the District Judge. Thus, the appeal of the respondents/defendants 
was treated well within time and argument of the petitioner is 
without any force and same is accordingly repelled. Reliance is 
placed on a case titled as Sherin and 4 others Vs. Fazal 
Muhammad and 4 others (1995 SCMR 584).  
11. 
The petitioner/plaintiff has filed suit for declaration but it 
could not produce any title document or order of allotment issued 
by the competent authority regarding permanent transfer of the 
title of the suit land in its favour. It is settled law that through 
declaratory suit under Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 
only a pre-existing right can be declared whereas no new right 
can be created. Reliance in this regard is placed on a recent 

 
C.R.No.506/2009 
 
11
pronouncement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan cited 
as Director Military Lands and Cantonment Quetta Cantt. Quetta 
and others Vs. Aziz Ahmed and others (2023 SCMR 860) 
relevant text whereof is as under:- 
“…we are clear in our mind that through a declaration in 
civil matters claimed under section 42 of the Specific 
Relief Act a pre-existing right can be declared and a new 
right cannot be created by grant of a decree by the civil 
court. Same is the position here, the learned High court 
under the Constitutional Jurisdiction vested in it under 
Article 199 can declare a pre-existing right and no new 
right can be created through a declaration issued under 
Article 199…”  
12. 
The next significant aspect of the matter is that the land 
was transferred by the Central Government in favour of 
Provincial Government on 13.11.1968 but the instant suit was 
filed by the petitioner/plaintiff in 1984 i.e. after lapse of 15 years 
without furnishing any reason in the plaint regarding the delayed 
agitating the matter whereas the limitation for filing a suit for 
declaration, under Article 120 of the Limitation Act, 1908 is six 
years as such the suit filed by the petitioner/plaintiff is badly time 
barred by nine years and no convincing explanation in this regard 
has been furnished for condonation of the delay which is a fatal 
flaw. Reliance is placed on the case titled as Agha Syed Mustaque 
Ali Shah Vs Mst. Bibi Gul Jan & Others (2016 SCMR 910). 
13.  
The learned trial court has failed to appreciate the legal 
and factual aspects of the case and decreed the suit of the 
petitioner/plaintiff whereas the learned appellate court, after 
discussing the facts as well as evidence of the parties, through a 
well-reasoned judgment & decree has rightly allowed the appeal 
of 
the 
respondents 
and 
dismissed 
the 
suit 
of 
the 
petitioner/plaintiff. It is well settled law that in the event of 
conflict of judgments, findings of appellate Court are to be 

 
C.R.No.506/2009 
 
12
preferred and respected, unless it is shown from the record that 
such findings are not supported by evidence. Reliance is placed 
on the cases reported as Muhammad Hafeez & Another Vs. 
District Judge, Karachi East & Another (2008 SCMR 398) and 
Rao Abdul Rehman (deceased) through legal heirs Vs. 
Muhammad Afzal (deceased) through legal heirs and others 
(2023 SCMR 815). 
14. 
In view of above, this civil revision having no merits is 
hereby dismissed. No order as to costs. Office is directed to 
dispatch copies of this judgment to the Senior Member, Board of 
Revenue, Secretary, Mines & Minerals Department, Government 
of the Punjab and Deputy Commissioner, Jhelum for information 
and further necessary action as per law.
