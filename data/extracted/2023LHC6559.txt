I. 
OVERTURE TO THE FACTS OF THE CASE 
2. 
Brief facts of the case, as per petition, are that in the year 1947 
the deceased father of the “Petitioners” and the “Respondents” 
namely Ch. Hakim ud Deen Noon started business under the name and 
style of “SMILA Bakery” at Railway Road, Saddar, Rawalpindi. After 
his demise and selling out inherited land and the “SIMLA Bakery”, the 
“Petitioners” and the “Respondents” jointly started a business with 

Civil Original No.04 of 2023 
 
3 
the name of “Rahat Bakers” at 41/A, Hospital Road, Rawalpindi. The 
above said name was thereafter changed to present nomenclature as 
“Tehzeb Bakers” due to filing of multiple suits between the parties. 
The business at the “Tehzeb Bakers” remained quite flourished and 
expanded to various branches i.e. (i) Chib Plaza Scheme-III, Chaklala, 
Rawalpindi, (ii) Karachi Company, Ramzan Plaza, Mangla Road 
Islamabad, (iii) F/11, Islamabad, (iv) Al-Rehmat Plaza, G-11, 
Islamabad, (v) Plot 17/18, Gol Market, I-8, Islamabad, (vi) Block A, 
Street No.1A, Main Road, PWD, Islamabad, (vii) G.T. Road Near 
Bahria Town, Phase-VII Gate, (viii) Main G.T. Road, Wah Cantt, 
Rawalpindi, (ix) F-10 Markaz and Commercial Market. Owing to such 
expansion of business and branches, the management was handed over 
to Khalil Ahmed Noon/Respondent No.3 who has control over all 
management, accounts administration of the businesses and all 
documents pursuant thereto were under his custody. The “Petitioners” 
claim to be shareholders/partners of “Tehzeb Bakers” whose 
respective shares have been denied by the “Respondents” which 
prompted the “Petitioners” to seek winding up of the “Tehzeb 
Bakers” through liquidation by filing the petition in hand.  
II. 
ARGUMENTS OF THE PETITIONERS 
3. 
Mr. Saqib Shafique, Advocate for the “Petitioners” inter alia 
contended that the “Petitioners” are partners of “Tehzeb Bakers” on 
the basis of three partnership deeds dated 29.10.1994, 28.01.2002 and 
02.12.2011 and are holders of 20% share each; that the 
“Respondents” fraudulently changed the name of M/s Hibake to 
“Tehzeb Bakers” without the knowledge of the “Petitioners” and 
registered it before the Respondent No.5/Security and Exchange 
Commission of Pakistan (the “SECP”) with fraud and collusion and 
such act is prejudicial to their rights of business coupled with right to 
due process; that all branches of “Tehzeb Bakers” are generating sale 
more than Rs.40 million on daily basis, 20% share out of which is 
being denied by the “Respondents”.

III. 
ARGUMENTS OF THE RESPONDENTS 
(i) Arguments of Respondent No.5-SECP 
4. 
Mirza Muzaffar Ahmed, Chief Prosecutor SECP and Fatima 
Shabbir and Shahzad Ali Rana, Advocates filed report and parawise 
comments on behalf of the “SECP” and objected qua maintainability 
of this petition requiring threshold of 10% of shareholding of the 
“Petitioners” in “Tehzeb Bakers” to file an application in terms of 
Section 286 of the “Act” before this Court. In report and parawise 
comments, it has been stated that as per record M/s Hibake (Private) 
Limited was registered vide Certificate of Incorporation dated 
20.01.2012 and vide Memorandum and Articles of Association, Khalil 
Ahmed Noon, Chaudhary Liaqat Ali Noon and Chaudary Rashid Ali 
Noon were reported as subscriber/members/directors having 5100, 
4950 and 4950 shares respectively. It has further been stated that as 
per Form-26 dated 28.01.2013 the name of M/s Hibake (Private) 
Limited was changed to Tehzeb (Private) Limited vide certificate 
dated 18.02.2013 and presently, the above-named persons are existing 
shareholders of “Tehzeb Bakers”.  
(ii) Arguments of Respondents No.2, 3 & 7 
5. 
Mr. Kashif Ali Malik, ASC filed reply and inter alia objected 
to maintainability of petition on the ground that the “Petitioners” 
never remained members, shareholders, creditors or contributors of 
“Tehzeb Bakers” rather its management includes Khalil Ahmed 
Noon, Chairman/CEO, Ch. Liaqat Ali Noon, Director and Rashid Ali 
Noon, Director; that this petition lacks fulfillment of requirement of 
10% shareholding in terms of Section 286 of the “Act”; that the 
“Petitioners” have no concern or connection with the properties 
owned and possessed by the “Respondents” other than the joint 
proprieties in respect of which suits for partition are pending before 
the court of competent jurisdiction; that the “Petitioners” have 
prepared forged, bogus and fabricated documents just to claim interest 
in the business of “Tehzeb Bakers”; that the “Petitioners” had no 

Civil Original No.04 of 2023 
 
5 
right or interest in “Tehzeb Bakers” as it is under the sole 
proprietorship of the Respondent No.3; that the “Petitioners” have 
annexed forged and fabricated partnership deeds which were never 
executed by the “Respondents” as such the “Petitioners” claimed 
share in the business is absolutely incorrect and fallacious.  
IV. 
DETERMINATION BY THE COURT 
6. 
At the very outset it is observed here that the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in its judgment reported as “GOVERNMENT OF SINDH 
THROUGH 
SECRETARY 
EDUCATION 
AND 
LITERACY 
DEPARTMENT and others versus NIZAKAT ALI and others” (2011 
SCMR 592) has held that every Court prior to taking cognizance and 
adjudicating upon an issue should first resort to the question of 
assumption of its jurisdiction and if it comes to the conclusion that 
jurisdiction can be assumed only then the issue can be adjudicated 
upon. The question regarding assumption of jurisdiction and its 
exercise has very comprehensively been dealt with and decided by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case titled “FAUJI FOUNDATION 
and another versus SHAMIMUR REHMAN” (PLD 1983 SC 457). 
Therefore, in the light of above referred case law, the question of 
assuming jurisdiction is being decided at first instance.  
7. 
The “Petitioners” have filed this petition under Section 5 read 
with 286 of the “Act”. Part II of the “Act” deals with jurisdiction of 
the Court and Section 5 of the “Act”, starts with, “the Court having 
jurisdiction under this Act shall be the High Court having jurisdiction 
in the place at which the registered office of the company is situated”. 
The term “registered office” is also defined under Section 21 of the 
“Act” which demonstrates that the registered office will be the one 
where all communications and notices would be addressed to the 
company. Further there is a requirement to be fulfilled by a company 
to notify its registered office under Regulation 4 of the Company 
(General Provisions and Forms) Regulations, 2018. Pertinently, there 
is no dispute with regard to location of registered office of “Tehzeb 
Bakers” by the “Petitioners” and the “Respondents” which is 41/A, 

Civil Original No.04 of 2023 
 
6 
Hospital Road, Saddar Rawalpindi and said address of registered office 
is also mentioned in Form-21, placed on record by the “SECP” in its 
report. In view thereof, this Court has the jurisdiction to entertain 
petition under Section 5 of the “Act” in the light of judgment passed 
by this Court in “M/s MANDVIWALLA BUILDERS & DEVELOPERS 
AND MANGLA VIEW RESORT (PVT.) LIMITED versus M. AWAIS 
SHEIKH CEO MANGLA VIEW RESORT AND MANGLA GARRISON 
HOUSING (PVT.) LIMITED and others” (2023 CLD 885 Lahore) 
(Rawalpindi Bench).  
7. 
Next core question arising out of instant proceedings and 
requires determination is whether the “Petitioners” are members or 
shareholders of “Tehzeb Bakers” and whether they have fulfilled the 
requirements to avail remedy under Section 286 of the “Act” which is 
reproduced hereunder: 
“286. Application to Court.-(1) If any member or 
members holding not less than ten percent of the 
issued share capital of a company, or a creditor 
or creditors having interest equivalent in amount 
to not less than ten percent of the paid up capital 
of the company, complains, or complain, or the 
Commission or registrar is of the opinion, that the 
affairs of the company are being conducted, or 
are likely to be conducted, in an unlawful or 
fraudulent manner, or in a manner not provided 
for in its memorandum, or in a manner oppressive 
to the members or any of the members or the 
creditors or any of the creditors or are being 
conducted in a manner that is unfairly prejudicial 
to the public interest, such member or members 
or, the creditor or creditors, as the case may be, 
the Commission or registrar may make an 
application to the Court by petition for an order 
under this section. 
 
(2) If, on any such petition, the Court is of opinion- 
 
(a) that the company's affairs are being 
conducted, or are likely to be conducted, as 
aforesaid; and 
 
(b) that to wind-up the company will unfairly 
prejudice the members or creditors; 

Civil Original No.04 of 2023 
 
7 
 
the Court may, with a view to bringing to an end 
the matters complained of, make such order as it 
thinks fit, whether for regulating the conduct of 
the company's affairs in future, or for the 
purchase of the shares of any members of the 
company by other members of the company or by 
the company and, in the case of purchase by the 
company, for, the reduction accordingly of the 
company's capital, or otherwise. ….”  
(emphasis added) 
 
8. 
Perusal of the above-quoted provisions clearly manifests that 
the basic requirement for seeking intervention of this Court by a 
member or creditor of a company under Section 286 of the “Act” is to 
be a member having not less than ten percent (10%) of issued share 
capital of a company or be a creditor having not less than ten percent 
(10%) of the paid-up capital of a company. Moreover, the next 
requirement is that such a member or creditor has to satisfy this Court 
by making an application that the affairs of the company are being 
conducted, or are likely to be conducted, in (a) an unlawful manner, or 
(b) fraudulent manner, or (c) a manner not provided for in its 
memorandum, or (d) a manner oppressive to any of the member(s) or 
creditor(s), or (e) a manner that is unfairly prejudicial to the public 
interest. If the Court is of the opinion that the affairs of the company 
are being conducted, or are likely to be conducted, as aforesaid and 
winding up of the company will unfairly prejudice the members or 
creditors, the Court may make any order it thinks fit with respect to 
(a) regulating the conduct of the company's affairs in future, or (b) the 
purchase of the shares of any members of the company by other 
members of the company or by the company.  
9. 
Mr. Saqib Shafique, Advocate, counsel for the “Petitioners”, 
when confronted, on what basis, the “Petitioners” claim themselves 
as members and shareholders of “Tehzeb Bakers”, he could not 
satisfy the Court through any document however, replied that the 
“Petitioners” claim it on the basis of three partnership deeds, 
registration of Trademark of Noon Group constituted jointly by the 

Civil Original No.04 of 2023 
 
8 
“Petitioners” and the “Respondents”, before the Registrar of 
Trademark on 01.01.2009 and registration of trademark of business of 
SCOOP and SAFILO, that was the part and parcel of “Tehzeb 
Bakers”, registered before the Registrar of Trademark on 22.03.2008 
and 30.09.2010. As noted that these partnership deeds are not the 
documents to declare the “Petitioners” as the members or shareholders 
of the “Tehzeb Bakers” because neither their names are reflected in 
the Memorandum and Article Association nor in the record of the 
“SECP” therefore, on the point, the petition is not maintainable, 
reasons for this would be discussed in later part of this judgments.  
While exercising the right of rebuttal, Mr. Kashif Ali Malik, ASC 
pointed out that the partnership deeds, relied upon by the 
“Petitioners” are forged and fabricated one as they have been 
prepared in collusion with each other just to claim interest in the 
business of “Tehzeb Bakers” whereas the actual fact of the matter is 
that the “Petitioners” never remained associated with the business of 
“Tehzeb Bakers”. They also pointed out that the building of registered 
office of “Tehzeb Bakers” was procured by the Respondent 
No.3/Chaudhary Khalil Ahmad Noon on twelve years lease vide 
Lease Deed dated 26.12.1993 and his name was registered with CBR, 
now FBR on 15.10.1995 and first branch of Rahat Bakers was 
established by him at the registered office in year 1995 and that Rahat 
Bakers was further registered with FBR on 15.03.1996 by said 
Chaudhary Khalil Ahmed Noon as a sole proprietor, pursuant to 
which tax returns have been filed being its sole proprietor. He further 
pointed out that the “Petitioners” have no concern, whatsoever, with 
the properties of the “Respondents” however, suits with regard to 
other joint properties are pending before the court of competent 
jurisdiction at Rawalpindi and Islamabad.   
10. 
Be that as it may and without commenting upon the legality or 
authenticity of partnership deeds referred to above, the “Petitioners” 
in order to invoke Section 286 of the “Act” have to fulfill mandatory 
requirement being members and holding threshold of 10% issued 

Civil Original No.04 of 2023 
 
9 
share capital of “Tehzeb Bakers”. Pertinently, a company consists of 
members, though it has its own separate legal entity and its members 
are the persons who constitute the company as a corporate body. In 
the case of a company limited by shares, the shareholders are the 
members. The terms “members” and “shareholders” are usually used 
interchangeably, being synonymous, as there can be no membership 
except through the medium of shareholding. Thus, in general, every 
shareholder is a member and every member is a shareholder. 
However, there may be exceptions to this statement, a person may be 
a holder of shares by transfer but will not become its member until the 
transfer is registered in the books of the company in his favour and his 
name is entered in the register of members. Similarly, a member who 
has transferred his shares, though he does not hold any shares yet he 
continues to be a member of the company until the transfer is 
registered and his name is removed from the register of members 
maintained by the company. In a company limited by guarantee, the 
persons who are liable under the guarantee clause in its Memorandum 
of Association are members of the company. Likewise, in an 
unlimited company, the members are the persons who are liable to the 
company, each in proportion to the extent of their interests in the 
company, to contribute the sums necessary to discharge in full, the 
debts and liabilities of the company, in the event of its being wound-
up. The person desirous of becoming a member of a company must 
have the legal capacity of entering into an agreement in accordance 
with the provisions of the Contract Act, 1972. It is to be noted that 
though the term ‘members’ has not been defined under Section 2 of 
the “Act” but Section 2(21) of the Companies Ordinance, 1984 
(Repealed) specifies the attributes that qualify a person to be a 
member of a Company. The said section reads as under: 
"member" means, in relation to a company having share 
capital, a subscriber to the memorandum of the 
company and every person to whom is allotted, or who 
becomes the holder of, any share, scrip or other security 
which gives him a voting right in the company and 
whose name is entered in the register of members, and, 

Civil Original No.04 of 2023 
 
10 
in relation to a company not having a share capital, any 
person who has agreed to become a member of the 
company and whose name is so entered. 
Underlying for emphases 
 
11. 
Likewise, Section 118 of the “Act” also specifies the attributes 
that qualify a person to be a member of a Company which reads as:  
118. Members of a company.—The subscribers 
to the memorandum of association are deemed 
to have agreed to become members of the 
company 
and 
become 
members 
on 
its 
registration and every other person- 
(a) to whom is allotted, or who becomes the 
holder of any class or kind of shares; or 
(b) in relation to a company not having a share 
capital, any person who has agreed to become a 
member of the company; 
and whose names are entered; in the register of 
members, are members of the company. 
Underlying for emphases 
 
12. 
Above two provisions of law define the modes of becoming a 
member of a company, firstly by subscribing to memorandum; 
secondly by allotment of shares and thirdly by entering their name in 
the register of members of a company in terms of Section 119 of the 
“Act”. It is pertinent to mention here that though the “Petitioners” 
claim themselves as members and shareholders of “Tehzeb Bakers” 
but none of the modes, mentioned above, which create obligation 
upon them, have been fulfilled for invoking Section 286 of the “Act”. 
Thus, the present case, however, cannot benefit from the rule 
expressed by the foregoing provisions of the statutes and in absence of 
clear statutory intendment to the contrary, the above requirements 
setting out the essential attributes of a member, cannot therefore, be 
disregarded. In this view of the matter, it is held that the “Petitioners” 
never remained the members or shareholders of “Tehzeb Bakers” 
hence, the prayers made by them cannot be acceded to. 
13. 
During the course of arguments, Mr. Kashif Ali Malik, ASC 
argued that M/s Hibake (Pvt) Limited was originally registered with 
the SECP by the Respondent No.3/Chaudhary Khalil Ahmed Noon as 

Civil Original No.04 of 2023 
 
11 
sole proprietor and thereafter its name was changed by filing 
application before the “SECP” by said Chaudhary Khalil Ahmed 
Noon as is evident from Form 26 dated 28.01.2013. It has further been 
stated that aforesaid Respondent also got the copyrights of “Tehzeb 
Bakers” which was duly registered in the Register of Copyrights 
under Serial No.26484, Registration No.35887 by the Registrar of 
Copyrights under Copyrights Ordinance, 1962 read with Rule 7(2) of 
the Copyrights Rules, 1967. It has further been added that trademark 
of “Tehzeb Bakers” was also got registered by the Respondent No.3 
in the register of Trademarks vide Registration No.319709, under the 
Trademark Ordinance, 2001.  
14. 
A ground of possessing trademark and copyrights registration 
rights in the name of the “Petitioners” and the “Respondents” have 
also been agitated with the stance that the “Petitioners” and the 
“Respondents” constituted Noon Group which was registered before 
the Registrar of Trademark on 01.01.2009, where the Petitioner No.1 
was appointed as Executive of the Group and further the parties 
started other businesses of SCOOP and SAFILO that too were 
registered in trademark register on 22.03.2008 and 30.09.2010. 
Needless to add that the issues with respect to trademark or 
intellectual property rights cannot be settled through this petition as 
this issue has already been dealt with by this Court in “NADEEM 
KIANI versus M/s AMERICAL LYCETUFF PVT LIMITED etc”  
(2021 CLD 7) holding that “while dealing with an application under 
Section 286 of the “Act”, the Court cannot look into dispute inter se 
the parties and this Section cannot be invoked for settlement of 
disputes in respect of intellectual property rights between the parties 
in which other forums are available under the relevant laws”.  
Therefore, in view of the above said dictum laid down by this Court, 
this ground is turned down. 
15. 
In the case in hand, the record submitted by the SECP verifies 
the stance of the “Respondents” by reporting that M/s Hibake 
(Private) Limited, having registered office at 41-A, Hospital Road, 

Civil Original No.04 of 2023 
 
12 
Saddar, Rawalpindi (Annex-H Page 40) was registered vide 
Certificate of Incorporation dated 20.01.2012 (Annex-A Page 5) and 
as per Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association, 
Chaudhary Liaqat Ali Noon, Chaudhary Khalil Ahmad Noon, and 
Chaudhary Rashid Ali Noon, the “Respondents” were reported as 
subscriber/members/directors having 5100, 4950 and 4950 shares 
respectively. Further, as per Form 26 dated 28.01.2013 (Annex-D, 
Page 22), a request was made by “Tehzeb Bakers” after passing a 
special resolution under Section 39 of the Companies Ordinance, 
1984 for change of the name from M/s Hibake (Private) Limited to 
the “Tehzeb (Private) Limited” which request was acceded to under 
Section 40 of the “Ordinance” vide certificate dated 18.02.2013 
(Annex-E Page 25). The “SECP” has also reported that vide Form 29 
dated 25.10.2021, received in its office on 31.03.2022, following 
appointments were reported: 
Sr.No. 
Name 
Designation 
1 
Khalil Ahmad Noon 
Director 
2 
Chaudhary Liaqat Ali Noon 
Director 
3 
Chaudhary Rashid Ali Noon 
Director 
4 
Khalil Ahmed Noon 
Chief Executive Officer 
 
16. 
Notably, M/s Hibake (Private) Limited was registered with the 
“SECP” on 20.01.2012 by the Respondent No.3/Khalil Ahmed Noon 
as sole proprietor but interestingly, the “Petitioners” did not agitate 
the matter before the concerned forums at the relevant time regardless 
of the fact that a remedy of rectification of register does lie with this 
Court under Section 126 of the “Act”, detailed interpretation of which 
alongwith its pathology, anatomy and judicial anthology has been 
given by this Court in “ABDULLAH KHAN USMANI versus 
SECURITY & EXCHANGE COMMISSION OF PAKISTAN and 
others” (2022 CLD 821). Furthermore, the “Petitioners” could 
approach the “SECP” regarding fraud of the “Respondents” in the 
affairs of “Tehzeb Bakers” and could get information through online 
service/SDMS portal provided by the SECP or alternatively by 

Civil Original No.04 of 2023 
 
13 
lodging complaint or writing an email or even through the phone 
provided for resolving complaints or even could contact through fax; 
but none of these methods were ever used by the “Petitioners” to 
strengthen their version and they remained mum for almost ten years 
and now this petition has been filed on 21.03.2023 which is also hit 
by period of laches. 
17. 
It is noted that the documents annexed with this petition do not 
show that the affairs of the Company are being conducted in an 
unlawful and fraudulent manner because the annexed documents 
includes the deeds of partnership, letter of trademark registry and 
agreement between the parties (Annex-G Page 31); hence the 
“Petitioners” have not brought on record anything which would 
constitute and lead to the conclusion that they are the members or 
shareholders of “Tehzeb Bakers” or that its affairs are being 
conducted in violation of Section 286 of the “Act”.  
18. 
In view of above, this petition is without any merits and is, 
therefore, dismissed.
