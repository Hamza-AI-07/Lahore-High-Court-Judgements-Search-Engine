Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – On 04.02.2022, the Special 
Judge, Anti-Corruption, Multan, indicted the Petitioner and nine others in 
case FIR No. 7/2021, dated 1.3.2021, registered at Police Station ACE 
Multan for offences under sections 420, 467, 468, 471, 109 PPC and 
section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. After framing the 
charge, the Special Judge summoned prosecution evidence and recorded 
the testimonies of three witnesses, Mst. Azra Parveen (PW-1), Rana 
Iftikhar Ahmad Khan (PW-2), and Talha Abdul Rehman Khan (PW-3). 
While all the accused cross-examined the witnesses, the Petitioner sought 
repeated adjournments on various pretexts. On 7.1.2023, the Special 
Judge granted him a “last opportunity” to cross-examine the witnesses, 
subject to payment of Rs.10,000/- as diet money because they came from 
Islamabad for every hearing. The Petitioner did not pay the amount. On 
18.3.2023, he again failed to produce his counsel for the cross-
examination of the prosecution witnesses. Consequently, the Special 
Judge struck off his right to cross-examine them.

Through this petition under sections 435/439 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Cr.P.C.), the Petitioner has challenged the 
Special Judge’s order dated 18.1.2023 (the “Impugned Order”) before this 
Court. 
3. 
 
This petition raises the following two questions of law: 
(i) 
Was the Special Judge’s direction to the Petitioner to pay 
Rs.10,000/- to the prosecution witnesses lawful? 
(ii) 
Could the Special Judge lawfully strike off the Petitioner’s 
right to cross-examine the prosecution witness, even if he 
was using dilatory tactics and refusing to proceed with the 
cross-examination? 
I would address these questions seriatim.  
Diet money

Witnesses play a vital role in the administration of justice. 
Order XVI of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 contains detailed 
provisions for the summoning and attendance of witnesses in civil 
matters. It divides them into different categories and specifies separate 
provisions for payment of diet money and travel expenses.1 Rule 2(3) of 
Order XVI CPC provides that where the court is subordinate to the High 
Court, in fixing the scale of expenses, regard shall be had to any rules 
made in that behalf. In Ahmad and others v. Additional District Judge 
and others (2008 SCMR 1330), the Supreme Court of Pakistan held that 
if a defendant fails to deposit the process fees and diet money for 
witnesses required to be summoned through the court, the judge is left 
with no choice but to close his evidence. 
                                          
1 Rule 1(1) of Order XVI CPC mandates that immediately after framing the issues, the court shall direct 
the parties to file a list of witnesses within a period not exceeding seven days  
(See amendments of the Lahore High Court). Rule 2(1) provides that the party applying for a summons 
must, before permission is granted, and within a period to be fixed, deposit an amount sufficient to 
cover the witness’s travel and one day’s attendance expenses. The government is exempt from 
depositing such money when requesting a summons for its own officers. Rule 2(2) allows the court to 
grant reasonable remuneration to expert witnesses for their time spent giving evidence and performing 
any expert work necessary for the case. Rule 3 mandates that the amount deposited must be tendered to 
the witness when the summons is served personally,  except for government servants, where the sum is 
credited to the government (subject to certain exceptions). Rule 4 makes further stipulations to cater to 
the situations where the amount paid is insufficient to cover expenses or when the witness is detained 
for more than one day. 
 
Order XVI Rule 7A CPC stipulates that, unless the court decides otherwise, the party applying 
for the summons is responsible for its service. Rules 16 and 18 of Order V apply to personal service 
under this rule, as if done by a serving officer.  
 
Order XVI Rule 14 CPC gives the court the authority to summon any person, even if not called 
by the parties, if necessary, to give evidence or produce documents. Rule 14A provides that when a 
witness is summoned by the court of its own motion as aforesaid, his diet money shall be paid by such 
party or parties as the court may, in its discretion, direct.  When diet money is not deposited, payment 
shall be made out of contingencies, and an order shall be passed for recovery from any property of the 
party concerned and executed under section 36 CPC.

In criminal cases, the issue of diet money is governed by 
sections 244(3) and 544 Cr.P.C., and Rule 26.30 of the Police Rules, 
1934. Section 244 Cr.P.C., found in Chapter XX of the Cr.P.C., pertains 
to the trial of summons cases by Magistrates. It outlines the procedure 
when the accused pleads not guilty or the magistrate decides not to 
convict him despite his admission and proceeds with the trial. Section 
244(2) Cr.P.C. provides that the magistrate may, if he thinks fit, on the 
application of the complainant or the accused, issue a summons to any 
witness directing him to attend or to produce any document or thing. 
Section 244(3) states that the magistrate may, before summoning any 
witness on such an application, require that the witness’s reasonable 
expenses incurred in attending the trial be deposited in court. However, 
the accused is not required to deposit such expenses if he is charged with 
an offence punishable with imprisonment exceeding six months. 
6. 
 
Section 544 Cr.P.C. provides that, subject to any rules made 
by the Provincial Government, any criminal court may, if it deems 
appropriate, order the government to pay the reasonable expenses of any 
complainant or witness attending an inquiry, trial, or other proceeding 
before the court under the Code of 1898. 
7. 
 
Rule 26.30 of the Police Rules, 1934, stipulates that the 
instructions regarding the advance of diet money and travel expenses to 
witnesses, as outlined in Rule 26.27, shall be strictly followed in all police 
stations.2 
8. 
 
Given the above, a magistrate may only direct an accused to 
deposit expenses for summoning a witness in summons cases where he is 
charged with an offence punishable with imprisonment up to six months. 
Additionally, under section 544 Cr.P.C., subject to any rules framed by 
the Provincial Government, the court has the discretion to order the 
government to pay the reasonable expenses of a complainant or witness 
attending any inquiry, trial, or other proceeding. 
9. 
 
Diet money and travel expenses can be considered a subset 
of the broader category of costs incurred during criminal proceedings. The 
question is whether an accused can be directed to pay the prosecution 
witness’s diet money and travel expenses under section 344(1) Cr.P.C., 
                                          
2 Rule 26.27 prescribes the diet of accused persons.

which empowers the court to adjourn the proceedings of any inquiry or 
trial, if necessary, by order in writing, stating the reasons therefor, from 
time to time, on such terms as it thinks fit.3 Some authorities hold that 
courts have inherent power to impose adjournment costs for the safe 
administration of justice,4 while others maintain that the phrase  
“on such terms” in section 344(1) Cr.P.C. is significant and can be 
legitimately construed as empowering the court to impose costs when 
granting an adjournment.5 Nonetheless, this power must be exercised 
judiciously and should not create barriers preventing the accused from 
effectively defending themselves.6  
10. 
 
The Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 is the cornerstone of 
the criminal justice system in Pakistan. Its primary objective is to provide 
a 
detailed 
and 
comprehensive 
procedural 
framework 
for 
the 
administration of criminal justice, covering all aspects from the 
investigation of crimes to the prosecution and adjudication of criminal 
cases. The Code applies to all criminal matters unless there is a special 
law conferring special jurisdiction or power or prescribes a special form 
of procedure. Special laws sometimes contain specific provisions for 
imposing adjournment costs. In this regard, reference may be made to 
sections 19(8) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, and 16(2) of the Anti-
Rape (Investigation and Trial) Act, 2021. 
11. 
 
Criminal courts generally do not impose costs on the accused 
during the trial, as the primary focus is to ensure justice through a fair 
process without burdening the accused with procedural expenses while 
the case is being adjudicated. I respectfully agree that a court may impose 
penalties if the accused engages in conduct that delays the trial or 
obstructs the judicial process. While these penalties are sometimes 
referred to as costs, they are more accurately sanctions for misconduct or 
                                          
3 For ease of reference, section 344(1) Cr.P.C. is reproduced below: 
 
344. 
Power to postpone or adjourn proceedings. – (1) If, from the absence of a witness 
or any other reasonable cause, it becomes necessary or advisable to postpone the commencement of or 
adjourn any inquiry or trial, the Court may, if it thinks fit, by order in writing, stating the reasons 
therefor from time to time, postpone or adjourn the same on such terms as it thinks fit, for such time as 
it considers reasonable and may by a warrant remand the accused if in custody: 
Remand.   Provided, no Magistrate shall remand an accused person to custody under this 
section for a term exceeding fifteen days at a time.

procedural non-compliance rather than traditional trial costs. The phrase 
“on such terms” cannot be stretched to undermine the specific provisions 
of the Criminal Procedure Code and the Police Rules discussed above. 
12. 
 
It is pertinent to point out that the Code allows the court to 
impose fines or order compensation to the victim while convicting an 
accused. Section 544-A(1) Cr.P.C. mandates that when a person is 
convicted of an offence that results in death, harm, injury, mental anguish, 
or psychological damage to another person or causes damage, loss, or 
destruction of property, the court must, at the time of conviction, order the 
convict to pay compensation to the victim or their heirs, unless it gives 
reasons in writing for not doing so. The amount is determined based on 
the circumstances of the case. Section 544-A(3) Cr.P.C. further states that 
this compensation is in addition to any sentence imposed for the offence. 
Section 545(1) Cr.P.C. provides that whenever a criminal court imposes 
or confirms a fine, it may direct that the recovered fine be used for  
(a) covering the proper expenses of prosecution, (b) compensating any 
person for loss, injury, mental anguish, or psychological damage caused 
by the offence, if such compensation could be recoverable in a civil court, 
or (c) compensating a bona fide purchaser of stolen property when the 
offender is convicted of theft, misappropriation, breach of trust, cheating, 
or receiving stolen property, and the property is returned to its rightful 
owner. Section 546-A Cr.P.C. states that when a complaint regarding a 
non-cognizable offence is brought before a court, and the court convicts 
the accused, it may, in addition to any penalty imposed, direct the accused 
to pay the complainant: (a) any fees paid for filing the complaint or for the 
complainant’s examination, and (b) fees paid for serving notices to 
witnesses or the accused. If the accused fails to pay, the court may impose 
simple imprisonment for up to 30 days. Furthermore, while exercising its 
revisional powers, an Appellate Court or the High Court may also issue 
such an order. 
13. 
 
Sections 544-A, 545, and 546-A Cr.P.C. enable courts to 
impose financial penalties on convicted individuals. They are financial 
consequences of the conviction and intended as part of the punishment or 
restitution.

To conclude, in civil cases, a party may lose the right to have 
witnesses summoned through the court’s process, or the court may close 
its evidence if it fails to deposit the required diet money and travel 
expenses within the specified time. When the court summons a witness on 
its own motion, the court, at its discretion, may direct the payment of diet 
money by the concerned party or parties. If the deposit is not made, 
payment will be arranged from contingency funds, and an order will be 
issued for recovery from the party’s property, enforceable under section 
36 CPC. However, the Code of Criminal Procedure does not contain any 
provision that allows the court to close an accused’s right to cross-
examine a prosecution witness if the accused fails to pay the witness’s 
diet money or travel expenses. Reference in this regard may also be 
usefully made to Ghulam Nabi and others v. Shaukat Ali and another 
(PLD 2007 Lahore 368). The statutory framework governing diet money 
in criminal trials ensures that financial burdens do not obstruct an 
accused’s right to a fair defence. 
Striking off the right of cross-examination 
15. 
 
The concept of a fair trial is central to the administration of 
justice, and the right to cross-examine witnesses is a component of the 
right to a fair trial. Cross-examination is “the greatest legal engine ever 
invented for the discovery of truth.”7 In an adversarial legal system, it is a 
“primary evidentiary safeguard”,8 an acid test of the truthfulness of a 
statement made by a witness on oath in examination-in-chief.9 Taylor 
elaborates: 
“Cross-examination is justly regarded as one of the most efficacious 
tests by means of which the law has devised for the discovery of truth 
and by means of which the situation of the witness with respect to the 
parties and to the subject of litigation, his interest, his motives, his 
inclination and prejudices, his character, his means of obtaining correct 
and certain knowledge of the facts to which he bears testimony, the 
manner in which he has used the means, his power of discernment, 
memory and description are fully investigated and ascertained …”10

International human rights law recognizes the right to cross-
examination as a fundamental aspect of the right to a fair trial, which is 
enshrined in various international legal instruments. Article 14 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) explicitly 
guarantees the right of individuals to be informed of the charges against 
them, to have adequate time and facilities to prepare a defence, and to 
examine, or have examined, the witnesses against them. The European 
Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) also reflects this principle. Article 
6 of the ECHR emphasizes the right to a fair trial, which includes the right 
to question witnesses. The Court of Human Rights has reaffirmed that the 
right to cross-examine witnesses is essential to ensuring equality of arms 
between the prosecution and the defence. In Lüdi v. Switzerland (1992),11 
the Court emphasized the importance of cross-examination in ensuring a 
fair trial. The applicant, Lüdi, had been convicted based on evidence from 
an undercover police officer. Lüdi was denied the opportunity to cross-
examine the officer. The Court ruled that this violated his rights under 
Article 6 of the ECHR. It found that the fairness of the proceedings had 
been compromised by the inability to cross-examine a key witness. 
17. 
 
The right to cross-examination is also a crucial element of 
due process in many national legal systems. In the United States, this right 
is explicitly protected under the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution, 
which guarantees that a person accused of a crime has the right “to be 
confronted with the witnesses against him.” In Crawford v. Washington, 
541 US 36 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that testimonial 
statements made out of court cannot be admitted as evidence unless the 
witness is unavailable and the accused has had a prior opportunity to 
cross-examine them. This landmark decision reaffirmed that the right to 
confrontation is not just a procedural formality but a substantive right 
essential to a fair trial. The Court’s decision emphasized that denying the 
accused the chance to cross-examine a witness deprives them of a key tool 
for defending themselves, violating their constitutional rights. 
18. 
 
Cross-examination in the U.K. operates within the 
framework of the common law tradition, which relies on the adversarial 
system of justice. In addition to common law, the Criminal Procedure

Rules and other statutory measures provide guidelines on how cross-
examination is conducted in the U.K. For instance, the Youth Justice and 
Criminal Evidence Act 1999 includes provisions to protect vulnerable 
witnesses while still allowing the defence to challenge their evidence. 
Special measures, such as screens or video links, can be used in cases 
involving vulnerable or intimidated witnesses, such as children or victims 
of sexual offences. However, even with these protective measures, the 
fundamental right to cross-examine remains intact, ensuring that the 
defence can still test the evidence while maintaining the witness’s dignity 
and well-being. 
19. 
 
The U.K. courts have also been careful to balance the rights 
of the accused with the protection of witnesses. In cases like R v. Davis 
[2008] UKHL 36, the House of Lords ruled that using anonymous 
witnesses to prevent effective cross-examination violated the defendant’s 
right to a fair trial. The Court held that while protecting witnesses was 
important, it should not come at the expense of the accused’s ability to 
challenge the evidence. This decision reaffirmed the principle that cross-
examination is crucial for ensuring that untested or unreliable testimony 
does not compromise justice. 
20. 
 
In Browne v. Dunn, Lord Halsbury [(1893) 6 R. 67], the 
House of Lords held that “nothing would be more absolutely unjust than 
not to cross-examine witnesses upon evidence which they have given.” In 
Abel v. The Queen [(1955), 115 C.C.C. 119 (Que. Q.B.)], the Court held 
that “there can be no question of the importance of cross-examination … 
It is the ultimate means of demonstrating truth and of testing veracity. 
Cross-examination must be permitted so that an accused can make a full 
answer and defence. The opportunity to cross-examine witnesses is 
fundamental to providing a fair trial to an accused. This is an old and 
well-established principle that is closely linked to the presumption of 
innocence.” Similarly, in Mechanical & General Inventions Co. Ltd. v. 
Austin and the Austin Motor Co. Ltd. [(1935) AC 346], the Court 
described cross-examination as the “powerful and valuable weapon for 
the purpose of testing the veracity of a witness and the accuracy and 
completeness of his story.” This observation was reiterated in Wakeley v. 
The Queen [(1990) 93 ALR 79, 86].

21. 
 
However, there are certain exceptions where the right to 
cross-examination may be limited. For instance, under the Domestic 
Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, a defendant in cases of sexual 
offences or domestic violence may be prohibited from cross-examining 
the victim personally. In such cases, a court-appointed lawyer conducts 
the cross-examination to preserve the accused’s right to a fair trial while 
protecting the victim from further trauma. 
22. 
 
In Michael Garfield Lyttle v. Her Majesty The Queen  
(2004 SCC 5), the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that “the right of an 
accused to cross-examine prosecution witnesses without significant and 
unwarranted constraint is an essential component of the right to make a 
full answer and defence. The right of cross-examination, which is 
protected by ss.7 and 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms, must be jealously protected and broadly construed.” 
23. 
 
In Muhammad Hussain alias Julfikar Ali v. State  
(Govt. of NCT of Delhi) (AIR 2012 SC 750 : 2012 SCMR 1610), the 
Supreme Court of India observed that “the fate of the criminal trial 
depends upon the truthfulness or otherwise of the witness and, therefore, 
it is of paramount importance. To arrive at the truth, its veracity should be 
judged, and for that purpose, cross-examination is an acid test. It tests the 
truthfulness of the statement made by a witness on oath in examination-
in-chief. Its purpose is to elicit facts and materials to establish that the 
evidence of witness is fit to be rejected.” 
24. 
 
Courts in Pakistan also acknowledge that the accused’s right 
to cross-examine witnesses is one of the most fundamental rights. In 
Ghulam Rasool Shah and another v. The State (2011 SCMR 735), the 
Supreme Court observed, “Undoubtedly, cross-examination is the most 
effective tool to test the credibility of witnesses. A statement recorded 
without undergoing this scrutiny will inevitably lead to injustice for the 
accused.” 
25. 
 
In Pakistan, cross-examination is a statutory right recognized 
and provided under Article 133 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat 1984 (QSO). It 
is also a part of the right to a fair trial guaranteed under Article 10A of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, because, as 
discussed above, no fair trial is possible unless an accused is allowed to 

Crl. Revision No.187/2023

confront his accuser. In Muhammad Bashir v. Rukhsar and others  
(PLD 2020 SC 334), the accused, Rukhsar, was denied the opportunity to 
cross-examine the petitioner, who had testified against him. Seeking to 
rectify this, he filed an application under section 540 Cr.P.C., requesting 
the court to summon the petitioner and allow cross-examination. The 
Additional Sessions Judge granted the request, and the High Court upheld 
the decision. The Supreme Court ruled that depriving Rukhsar of his right 
to cross-examine the petitioner violated his fundamental right. Thus, 
summoning and cross-examining him was entirely in accordance with the 
law. The Supreme Court highlighted that Chapter X of the QSO outlines 
the procedures for examining witnesses. Witness examination begins with 
“examination-in-chief” by the party calling the witness, followed by 
“cross-examination” by the opposing party, and may conclude with  
“re-examination”. The right to cross-examine belongs to the opposing 
party; it may be waived but cannot be unjustly denied.  
26. 
 
However, an accused cannot be permitted to abuse the legal 
process or obstruct court proceedings. If they deliberately fail to bring 
their lawyer, the court must appoint a defence counsel at state expense 
and proceed with the trial. In Abdul Ghafoor v. The State (2011 SCMR 
23), a murder case, the prosecution examined 13 witnesses, including two 
eyewitnesses. The accused-appellant failed to produce his counsel for 
their 
cross-examination 
despite 
repeated 
opportunities. 
In 
the 
circumstances, the trial court required him to cross-examine the witnesses 
himself and then proceeded to decide the case. The Supreme Court held 
that it is the primary duty of a trial court to ensure the discovery of truth 
and the fair administration of justice. If the accused’s counsel repeatedly 
sought adjournments and failed to appear, the court should have either 
appointed a defence counsel at State expense or provided the accused a 
final opportunity to arrange legal representation, failing which the trial 
could proceed. Since the trial court failed to follow these steps and 
unexpectedly required the accused to cross-examine witnesses despite his 
lack of legal expertise, the Supreme Court ruled that this approach led to a 
miscarriage of justice and allowed the accused another opportunity for 
cross-examination.  

Crl. Revision No.187/2023

27. 
 
A similar view was taken in Ghulam Rasool Shah’s case, 
where the Supreme Court reiterated that if an accused fails to engage 
counsel, the trial court must appoint a defence lawyer from the State’s 
panel and proceed with the trial, ensuring that the accused’s right to a fair 
trial remains protected. 
The case at hand 
28. 
 
The Special Judge’s order requiring the Petitioner to deposit 
Rs.10,000/- as diet money was legally flawed as it contravened section 
244(3) Cr.P.C., which explicitly exempts an accused from bearing witness 
expenses if charged with an offence punishable by imprisonment 
exceeding six months. By imposing this unlawful condition, the trial court 
misapplied the law and created a procedural hurdle that unjustly restricted 
the Petitioner’s right to cross-examine prosecution witnesses. 
29. 
 
Furthermore, striking off the Petitioner’s right to cross-
examine was a grave procedural flaw. As discussed, if an accused fails to 
produce counsel, the court must either grant a final opportunity to engage 
private representation or appoint a state defence counsel. The Special 
Judge failed to follow either course of action, depriving the Petitioner of a 
fundamental procedural safeguard and causing a grave miscarriage of 
justice. 
30. 
 
In view of the above, this petition is accepted, and the 
Impugned Order is set aside. The learned Special Judge is directed to 
provide the Petitioner one opportunity to engage counsel and cross-
examine the prosecution witnesses. If the Petitioner fails to do so within 
the prescribed time, he shall appoint a defence counsel and proceed with 
the trial in accordance with the law.
