JAWAD HASSAN, J. By way of this constitutional petition 
filed under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”) the Petitioner has called in 
question the vires of order dated 03.02.2023, whereby the President 
Secretariat (Public), Aiwan-e-Sadr, Islamabad maintained the findings 
of the Respondent No.1/Wafaqi Mohtasib (Ombudsman) (the 
“Ombudsman”) passed in terms of order dated 23.08.2022. 
I. 
CONTEXT 
2. 
Precisely the facts necessary for adjudication of instant petition 
are that the Respondent No.3, due to delay on the part of Petitioner in 
issuance of gas connection, filed a complaint for the said very purpose 
before the “Ombudsman”. Initially, the said complaint was closed 
with certain directions vide order dated 14.06.2022 however, a review 
petition filed by the Respondent No.3 before the “Ombudsman” was 

  
W.P.No.1791 of 2023  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       2 
accepted vide order dated 23.08.2022. The Petitioner being aggrieved 
of aforesaid order then filed representation before the Respondent 
No.2 who dismissed it through the impugned order dated 03.02.2023, 
hence this petition.  
II. 
ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the Petitioner inter alia contends that the 
“Ombudsman” was not vested with any jurisdiction to entertain the 
complaint filed by the Respondent No.3 and as such the impugned 
orders passed by it are without jurisdiction; that the Respondent No.3, 
instead of approaching the Respondent No.4/OGRA under Section 
42(e) of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority Ordinance, 2002 (the 
“Ordinance”) which provides a mechanism for resolution of 
complaints between a consumer and the Petitioner, has approached 
the wrong forum for resolution of the matter; that  the Ministry of 
Energy has imposed a ban on new gas connections to domestic sector, 
pursuant thereto the request of the Respondent No.3 could not be 
acceded to. The counsel for the Petitioner has placed reliance on “OIL 
AND GAS REGULATORY AUTHORITY through Chairperson and 
others versus SUI NORTHERN GAS COMPANY LIMITED through 
Chairperson and others” (2023 SCMR 908), “WAFAQI MOHTASIB 
SECRETARIAT, ISLAMABAD and others versus SNGPL, LAHORE 
and others” (PLD 2020 Supreme Court 586) and “Messrs RANA 
TEXTILES LTD. through Chief Executive versus SUI NORTHERN 
GAS PIPELINES LTD. through Authorized Attorney and others” 
(2016 YLR 1).   
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for Respondents contended that 
the issue in hand clearly falls within the jurisdiction of the 
“Ombudsman” and thus he has rightly exercised his jurisdiction. 
They have argued that the impugned orders do not suffer from any 
error or jurisdictional defect hence, this petition is not maintainable.  
5. 
I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the parties 
and perused the record.

III. 
DETERMINATION 
6. 
The heart of controversy revolves around in this petition is 
whether the “Ombudsman” has jurisdiction to entertain a complaint 
over a matter regarding installation of gas connection and to pass 
order thereon. Pertinently the office of “Ombudsman” was created 
under Article 3 of the Establishment of the Office of Wafaqi 
Mohtasib (Ombudsman) Order, 1983 (the “Order”), preamble 
whereof, provides for the appointment of the Wafaqi Mohtasib 
(Ombudsman) to diagnose, investigate, redress and rectify any 
injustice done to a person through mal-administration. The object of 
the “Order” was to rectify and injustice done to a person through 
maladministration on the part of any Agency. The purpose thus was to 
undo the administrative excesses from within the administration so 
that justice could be made available to the wronged persons without 
such persons being forced to knock at the doors of the Courts of law. 
Though the preamble to a statute is not an operational part of the 
enactment but it is a gateway, which discusses the purpose and intent 
of the legislature to necessitate the legislation on the subject and also 
sheds clear light on the goals that the legislator aims to secure through 
the introduction of such law. The preamble of a statute, therefore, 
holds a pivotal role for the purposes of interpretation in order to 
dissect the true purpose and intent of the law. Reliance in this regard 
is placed on “DIRECTOR GENERAL, FIA AND OTHERS Versus 
KAMRAN IQBAL and others” (2016 SCMR 447) whereby the 
Supreme Court held that “indeed, preamble to a Statute is not an 
operative part thereof, however, as is now well laid down that the 
same provides a useful guide for discovering the purpose and 
intention of the legislature”. The word ‘Agency’ is defined under 
Article 2(1) of the “Order” which means a Ministry, Division, 
Department, Commission or office of the Federal Government or 
statutory body, corporation or other institution established or 
controlled by the Federal Government but does not include the 
Supreme Court, the Supreme Judicial Council, the Federal Shariat 

  
W.P.No.1791 of 2023  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       4 
Court or a High Court”. The status of the Petitioner as a company and 
its owning and controlling by the Federal Government has already 
been determined by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in “THE 
MANAGING DIRECTOR, SUI SOUTHERN GAS. CO. LTD. versus 
SALEEM MUSTAFA SHAIKH and others” (PLD 2001 SC 176) 
whereby it has been held that “the petitioner was a company owned 
and controlled by the Federal Government, therefore, it could not 
be expected from the Government to enact rules and then not to 
enforce the same or to violate merely because the rules did not have 
the status of statutory rules”. The said view was further adopted by 
this court in “SUI NORTHERN GAS PIPELINES LIMITED versus 
WAFAQI MOHTASIB and others” (PLD 2019 Lahore 169) 
holding the Petitioner within the definition of “Agency” under the 
“Order. From a bare reading of Article 2(1) of the “Order” as well 
as the dictum laid down in above said judgments, the Petitioner 
being an “Agency” was amenable to the jurisdiction vested in the 
“Ombudsman” under the “Order”.  
7. 
The counsel for the Petitioner strenuously argued that the 
Respondent No.3 should have approached the Respondent No.4 
having exclusive jurisdiction in terms of Section 42(2)(e) of the 
“Ordinance”, if he had grievance, but he rather opted to approach 
the “Ombudsman” and also the gas connection cannot be installed 
due to ban imposed by the Ministry of Petroleum vide its letter 
dated 03.12.2021. Needless to say that the Respondent No.4/OGRA 
has nothing to do with imposition of ban on gas connection as 
Section 4(2)(e) of the “Ordinance” only deals with procedure for 
resolving disputes amongst the licensees, consumers and licensees, 
and users of open access facilities but in the case in hand, the 
Respondent No.3 was neither the licensee nor consumer as he was not 
provided gas connection despite fulfilling the requirements of the 
Petitioner by depositing first demand notice on 13.10.2021 and second 
on 02.12.2021 regardless of the fact that he first time applied for new 
gas connection in 2019, hence the provisions of the “Ordinance” does 

  
W.P.No.1791 of 2023  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       5 
not attract in the present case and substantial right in favour of the 
Respondent No.3 accrued after fulfilling requirements of the 
Petitioner by depositing payment before the cutoff date 12.11.2021 
that is prior to imposition of ban on 03.12.2021. Reliance is placed on 
judgment passed by Division Bench of this Court in “CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE, GEPCO and 3 others versus ASGHAR ALI RANA” 
(2018 YLR 1391) whereby it has been observed as under: 
“The order dated 13.04.2017 passed by this 
Court in the instant Appeal reveals that in 
compliance of this Court's order the demand 
notice 
dated 
12.04.2017 
amounting 
to 
Rs.2,40,500/- has been delivered to the 
Appellants/Department in the Court, therefore, 
now the Respondent cannot be denied from 
issuance of electricity connection as a 
substantial right has been accrued in his 
favour. Undeniably, the Respondent is the 
citizen of this country and the Constitution 
guarantees fundamental rights to every citizen. 
This 
Court 
is 
meant 
to 
protect 
and 
enforcement of the fundamental rights of the 
citizens which are being infringed by anyone. 
To enjoy the facility of electricity is 
fundamental right of the all the citizens under 
the Constitution and particularly, in the 
present era when life seems to be impossible 
without electricity. The Respondent has given 
application 
for 
Domestic 
Three 
Phase 
Connection for his house which is admittedly 
his fundamental right, as such the learned 
Single Judge has rightly observed in the 
impugned order that to provide electricity to 
the Respondent is his fundamental right which 
cannot be denied in any manner and has also 
placed reliance on the case titled Mehar 
Muhammad Nawaz, Ex-OG-I, Small Business 
Finance Corporation Multan v. Managing 
Director, Small Business Finance Corporation 
and 2 others 2009 SCMR 187”.  
 
8. 
It is pertinent to mention here that the “Ombudsman” vide 
its order dated 23.08.2022 has only recommended the Petitioner to 
install gas connection in favour of the Respondent No.3 and such 
recommendations are of recommendatory in nature and not a 

  
W.P.No.1791 of 2023  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       6 
judgment/decision as held by Division Bench of this Court in 
“MUHAMMAD YOUSAF versus THE SECRETARY FINANCE etc” 
(PLD 2021 Lahore 156) by holding that “in order to constitute a 
Court in stricto senso, it should have power to give a decision or a 
definite judgment, which has finality and authoritativeness therefore, 
office of Wafaqi Mohtasib is neither a Court nor Judicial Tribunal 
within the scope of Article 175 of the Constitution”. Moreover, it is 
emphasized that the matter agitated in the complaint was related to 
non-provision of new gas connection which has been denied by the 
Petitioner and such action of the Petitioner being “Agency” in terms 
of Section 2(1) of the “Order” if appearing to be unreasonable, 
unjust, oppressive and arbitrary shall amount to maladministration 
falling within the ambit of Article 9 of the “Order” for the purpose 
of exercise of jurisdiction by the “Ombudsman” in the matter to 
undo an act of administrative excess therefore, the “Ombudsman” 
has rightly observed that “the complainant should not be penalized 
of such a ban where he paid Urgent Fee before cutoff date i.e. 
12.11.2021” and such observation are in consonance with 
observation given by Division bench of this Court in “CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE, GEPCO case, mentioned supra. In this view of the 
matter, the Court is of the firm view that the impugned orders do 
not suffer from any legal infirmity or jurisdictional defect. Needless 
to add that judgments referred to by the learned counsel for the 
Petitioner cannot be relied upon being distinguishable from the facts 
and circumstances of the case in hand as each and every case has its 
own merits.  
9. 
In view of above, this petition holds no merit hence the same is 
hereby dismissed.
