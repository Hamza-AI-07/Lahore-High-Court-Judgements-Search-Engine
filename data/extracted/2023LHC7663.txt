Naveed 
Shahryar, 
Advocate 
for 
the 
petitioner. 
 
Brief facts necessary for the adjudication of this lis 
are that the petitioner/applicant filed an application under 
Section 12(2) CPC to challenge the order & decree dated 
11.02.2017 with the averments that the petitioner/ applicant 
had no knowledge about the pendency of appeal as no 
notice/summon was served to the applicant and neither the 
applicant appeared before the learned appellate court nor 
appointed any counsel. Hence, order & decree dated 
11.02.2017 is result of fraud, mis-representation having no 
effect upon the rights of the petitioner and further prayed 
that judgment & decree dated 17.09.2013 passed by 
learned trial court may also be set aside. The said 
application was contested by the then respondents No.1-A, 
1-B, 1-E, 1-F to H by filing written reply while learned 
counsel for respondents No.5 to 9 had no objection to the 
acceptance of the application however respondents No.2, 4, 

C.R. No.78446 of 2023

6 to 8 & 10 to 15 were proceeded against ex-parte. After 
hearing the arguments advanced by the contesting parties, 
the learned District Judge Faisalabad vide order dated 
17.10.2023 dismissed the application. Feeling aggrieved, 
the petitioner/applicant has filed the instant civil revision 
and challenged the validity of the impugned order passed 
by the learned District Judge Faisalabad. 
2. 
I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for 
petitioner and gone through the record.  
3. 
Perusal of record reveals that petitioner has 
alleged in the petition under section 12(2) of CPC that 
he neither received any notice in the suit nor he filed 
written statement and respondent No.1 in the petition 
filed forged written statement & reply to application 
with forged signature of petitioner and his counsel 
neither  cross examined the witnesses of respondent 
No.1 nor produced evidence of petitioner just to give 
favour to respondent No.1/plaintiff, however, record 
negates his allegations as the present petitioner was 
arrayed as defendant No.11 in the suit, wherein, he 
submitted Wakalatnama and also submitted his written 
statement and written reply duly signed by him through 
his counsel and ultimately the suit was decreed on 
merits vide judgment and decree dated 17.09.2013 
which was not challenged by the present petitioner 

C.R. No.78446 of 2023

before any higher forum. In so far as the appeal is 
concerned, the petitioner alleged that he was not served 
notice therefore he has no knowledge about the 
pendency of appeal, however, record contradicts his 
stance as in appeal petitioner’s name is mentioned as 
respondent No.3 and his address is the same in appeal 
as he has mentioned in petition u/s 12(2) CPC and also 
in the instant civil revision i.e. Chak No.207-RB, Abadi 
Gujjar Khan Wala, Tehsil & District Faisalabad. The 
petitioner/applicant was issued notice by adopting due 
process and even after publication of advertisement in 
newspaper on 26.11.2013 but he did not appear before 
the learned appellate court and ultimately proceeded 
against ex-parte and thereafter on the basis of 
statements of the contesting parties, the appeal was 
accepted by modifying the judgment and decree of the 
learned trial court dated 17.09.2013 vide order & 
decree dated 11.02.2017. All the parties to the suit and 
appeal are closely related to each other and close 
relatives of petitioner. Hence, it cannot be believed that 
petitioner was not aware of the proceedings in suit and 
appeal.    
 
 It is also proper to mention here that against the 
judgment and decree dated 11.02.2017 passed by the 

C.R. No.78446 of 2023 
4 
 
 
 
 
learned appellate court, the then defendant No.28 namely 
Farman Ullah Riaz S/O Rana Riaz Ahmad filed 
W.P.No.30245-2017 titled Muhammad Farman Ullah Riaz 
Vs Muhammad Bootay Khan etc wherein the present 
petitioner was impleaded as respondent No.3. Notice was 
issued by this Court in above mentioned writ petition which 
was personally served through process server to the present 
petitioner on 13.07.2017 but present petitioner never 
appeared before this Court in the above mentioned writ 
petition and the same was dismissed through judgment 
dated 11.10.2018 by this Court. The then petitioner namely 
Farman Ullah Riaz preferred C.A. No.90 of 2021 before 
the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan which was also 
dismissed as withdrawn. 
What has been discussed in above paras, petition 
under section 12(2) CPC is also dismissed being barred by 
limitation because even in the W.P.No.30245-2017, notice 
was again served on 13.07.2017 to the present petitioner 
and present petitioner filed application under section 12(2) 
CPC before the learned District Judge on 16.07.2022 while 
period of limitation to file an application under section 
12(2) CPC is three years from the date of knowledge of 
previous litigation. In this regard reliance is placed on the 
judgment reported as Bashir Ahmed through Legal 
Representative and others Vs Muhammad Hussain and 

C.R. No.78446 of 2023 
5 
 
 
 
 
others (PLD 2019 Supreme Court 504), which holds as 
under:- 
“A careful reading of the above provision 
clearly reveals that the period of limitation to 
file an application under section 12(2) of the 
C.P.C. would be three years, and the crucial 
starting point for the period of limitation 
would be when the right to apply accrues to 
the aggrieved applicant, which in case of an 
application under Section 12(2) of the C.P.C. 
would be the date when the impugned decision 
based on fraud and concealment was passed 
In case the aggrieved person has, by means of 
fraud, been kept from the knowledge of 
decision of the Court, he may then seek the 
extension of the commencing point of the 
period of limitation of three years from the 
date of decision under Article 181 of the Act, 
to the date of knowledge of the said decision 
under section 18 (supra). 
 
Reliance is also placed on the cases reported 
as Faizum alias Toor Vs Nander Khan and others 
(2006 SCMR 1931) & Fida Hussain Vs Ghulam 
Sarwar (2002 SCMR 1554).  
 
4. 
Law of limitation is considered to be preventive in 
nature which serves as a major deterrent against the factors 
and elements which can affect peace, tranquility and due 
order of State and society and bar of limitation in litigation 
also brings forth valuable rights in favour of other party. 
The law of limitation requires that a person must approach 
a court of law and take legal remedies with due care, 

C.R. No.78446 of 2023 
6 
 
 
 
 
diligence and within the time provided by the law, which is 
not the case in hand, hence, the application under section 
12(2) of C.P.C. was/is hopelessly time barred.  
5. 
As regards the contention of the learned counsel for 
the 
applicant/petitioner 
that 
limitation 
is 
a 
mere 
technicality, the same is not tenable. While dealing with the 
afore-noted question, the Supreme Court of Pakistan has 
held that the question of limitation cannot be termed to be a 
mere technicality and cannot be ignored while deciding 
cases. For reference reliance can be placed on Mst. Musarat 
Parveen v. Muhammad Yousaf and others (2023 SCMR 
1665), Messrs Pak Suzuki Motors Company Limited 
through Manager v. Faisal Jameel Butt and another (PLD 
2023 S.C. 482), Muhammad Anwar (decd) through L.Rs. 
and others v. Essa and others (PLD 2022 S.C. 716), Abdul 
Sattar v. Federation of Pakistan and others (2013 SCMR 
911) and Muhammad Islam v. Inspector General of Police, 
Islamabad and others (2011 SCMR 8). 
6. 
The petitioner has alleged fraud and representation 
against the respondents without any solid proof. Mere 
allegation not supported by any material would not 
invariably warrant inquiry or investigation. All these 
abovementioned facts negate the claim/ground as written in 
application for setting aside the impugned judgment. 
Therefore, plea being raised by the petitioner/ applicant at 
this stage has no force.   Learned counsel for the petitioner/ 

C.R. No.78446 of 2023 
7 
 
 
 
 
applicant failed to satisfy the judicial conscious of the court 
as presumption of truth is attached to the record of the court 
under Article 129 (e) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 
and Article 150 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973.  Authenticity of the judicial record cannot 
be doubted without any solid proof and only on the oral 
arguments of the learned counsel. Learned counsel for 
petitioner/ applicant has not been able to point out any 
plausible ground due to which he is seeking setting aside of 
the impugned order, hence, he is not entitled to any relief. 
It is a well settled principle that once the dispute is settled, 
the same cannot be allowed to be set at naught through the 
malafide act of the aggrieved party. 
7. 
In view of the foregoing discussion, this Court is of 
the considered view that learned District Judge has rightly 
dismissed the application of the petitioner. The impugned 
order has been passed after properly discussing in detail the 
un-rebuttable facts of the case and keeping in view the 
settled law.  No infirmity, legal or factual, has been pointed 
out in the impugned order, requiring interference, therefore, 
this petition is dismissed in limine.
