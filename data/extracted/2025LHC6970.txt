JUDGMENT 
 
Date of hearing:- 
19-11-2025 
Appellant by:- 
M/s Muhammad Amjad Hussain Rizvi and 
Zubair Ahmad Virk, Advocates.       
State  by:- 
Miss Nuzhat Bashir, Deputy Prosecutor 
General 
 
 
MUHAMMAD TARIQ NADEEM, J.:- Through this 
criminal appeal filed under Section 48 of the Control of Narcotic 
Substances Act, 1997, Shameer Khan (hereinafter referred to as the 
“appellant”) has called in question the vires of judgment dated 
17.07.2023, passed by the court of learned Additional Sessions 
Judge, Depalpur, District Okara (hereinafter referred to as the “trial 
court”), in case FIR No.1211 dated 28.11.2022, for an offence 
under Section 9(1)3(c) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 
1997, registered at Police Station Hujra Shah Muqeem, whereby he 
was handed down a guilty verdict in terms of Section 9(1)3(c) of 
the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, and sentenced to 
undergo rigorous imprisonment for eleven years along with fine of 
Rs.2,00,000/- or in default thereof, to further undergo simple 
imprisonment for six months, however, benefit provided under 
section 382-B Cr.P.C. was extended to him.

The prosecution story as given in Paragraph No.2 of the 
impugned judgment reads as under:- 
“2. Prosecution version as mentioned in FIR Ex.P-A 
lodged on the complaint (Ex.P-C) of Muhammad 
Azam S.I. (PW.5) that on 28.11.2022 he alongwith 
Sajid Ali 1430/C, Muhammad Imran 1989/C, Sardar 
Ali 1410/C on official vehicle driven by Muhammad 
Hussain 1743/C were present at Hansa Wala Mor

Kasur Depalpur Road for patrolling duty. On spy 
information raid was conducted at pul 18-D one person 
suspiciously tried to flee away on seeing them. They 
apprehended him. He disclosed his name Shameer 
Khan son of Atta Muhammad caste Hans resident of 4-
D. He was personally searched by Azam Ali SI and a 
blue colour plastic bag was recovered from his left 
hand. Three pieces of charras rectangular in shape 
having dark brown colour wrapped in yellow colour 
tape were recovered from said shopper. First piece of 
recovered charras was weighed and it was found 1100 
grams, second piece of charras was weighed and it was 
found 1100 grams and third piece of charras was 
weighed and it was found 1050 grams P-3 by 
computerized weighed scale by Azam Ali SI. Three 
pieces were respectively weighed and it was found 
3250 gram. The said bag was further checked by Azam 
Ali SI and Rs.850/- was recovered. Azam Ali SI 
separated 55 gram charas as sample from first piece, 
55 gram charras as sample from second piece and 53 
gram charras as sample from third piece for its 
chemical examination at PFSA Lahore. Samples of 
charras were weighed respectively and it was found 
163 gram. The said three parcels and remaining 
recovered three pieces of charas were made into six 
sealed parcels and one parcel of recovered said 
Rs.850/- were made into sealed parcel by Azam Ali SI 
by embossing stamp M.A alongwith blue colour 
shopper and the same was taken into possession vide 
recovery memo Ex.PB.” 
3. 
After registration of FIR, investigation of the case was 
entrusted to Umar Farooq S.I/I.O (PW.7) and after his 
investigation, report under Section 173 of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure, 1898, was submitted before the trial court. On 
indictment, the appellant pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. To 
substantiate its case, the prosecution produced seven witnesses in 
all, amongst whom, Jafar Hussain ASI (PW.1) is the scribe of FIR 
(Exh.PA), Muhammad Imran 1989/C (PW.2) is one of the two 
recovery witnesses, Ijaz Ahmad ASI (PW.3) is Incharge malkhana 
Depalpur, Sajid Ali 1430/C (PW.4) took complaint (Exh.PC) from 

Crl. Appeal No. 56371 of 2023

the crime scene to the police station for registration of FIR, Azam 
Ali S.I (PW.5) is the complainant of the case, Husnain Raza 
983/HC (PW.6), being Moharrar malkhana, received sample 
parcels as well as remaining parcels of case property and 
subsequently handed over sample parcels to Azam Ali S.I. (PW.5) 
for onward transmission to the office of Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore, whereas Umar Farooq S.I (PW.7) is investigating 
officer of the case. The prosecution, after giving up Sardar Ali 
1410/C as unnecessary and presenting the report (Exh.PE) issued 
by the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore, closed its 
evidence. Thereafter, the appellant was examined under Section 
342 Cr.P.C. during which he again denied the allegation and 
pleaded innocence, however, he neither opted to record his 
statement under Section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor produced any evidence 
in his defence. Upon culmination of trial, the trial court delivered 
the impugned judgment, convicting and sentencing the appellant as 
previously detailed. 
4. 
We have heard the arguments advanced by learned counsel 
for the appellant as well as learned Deputy Prosecutor General 
assiduously and perused the record minutely.  
5. 
In narcotics cases, the prosecution must substantiate not only 
the events unfolded as the FIR foretold, but also that the seized 
contraband comprising of sample parcels and remaining case 
property was kept in safe custody right from the crime-scene to the 
police station and thereafter safe transmission of sample parcels 
from the police station to the office of Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency for the purpose of analysis.  
 
The learned Deputy Prosecutor General has ardently 
endeavored to persuade the Court that the safe custody of case 
property and the safe transmission of sample parcels to the office of 
Punjab Forensic Science Agency have been incontrovertibly 
established, with no breach in the chain of custody, yet, upon a 
meticulous scrutiny of the prosecution evidence, it is apparent that 

Crl. Appeal No. 56371 of 2023   
 
 
4 
the assertions of learned Deputy Prosecutor General find no firm 
foundation from the record.  
In this context, it is imperative to highlight that Azam Ali 
S.I/complainant (PW.5), during his examination-in-chief, largely 
reiterated the allegations contained in complaint (Exh.PC) but 
during cross-examination, he (PW.5) explicitly stated as follows:- 
 “Whenever I leave the police station I incorporate my 
purpose of departure from police station, similarly, 
when I come back at police station I incorporate the 
factum of proceedings conducted by me outside the 
police station in my rupt of arrival. Same procedure was 
adopted by me at police station Hujra Shah Muqeem on 
28.11.2022. I have seen rupt No.31 Exh.PD on the basis 
of which I came back at police station at about 03:30 pm 
and incorporate my arrival in the said rupt. I 
incorporated my return to the police station from place 
of occurrence through said rupt No.31 Exh.DE 
correctly. It was my version that I handed over the 
custody of accused and case property/parcels to the I.O 
at the place of occurrence. It is correct that in rupt 
No.31 Exh.DE it has been incorporated that accused of 
case FIR No.1211/2022 and case property was handed 
over to the I.O.  
 
 
His credibility being a material prosecution witness has been 
further called into question by the subsequent answers which he 
provided during cross-examination and in this regard, relevant lines 
from his cross-examination read as under:- 
It is correct that as per registered Roznamcha Exh.DB I 
entered my arrival at police station for the first time on 
02.12.2022 at 10:10 am . It is not remember to me whether 
prior to 10:10 am I was present at police station or not on 
02.12.2022? -------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
it is correct that as per Exh.DD the remaining case 
property of the present case was transmitted from police 
station to the office of main malkhana on 02.12.2022 at 
09:28 am and the same was deposited in the office of main 
malkhana at 07:10 pm on 02.12.2022. it is correct that as 
per Exh.DC the sample parcels of the present case was 
transmitted from police station to the office of PFSA on 
02.12.2022 at 09:21 am and the same was deposited in the 
office of PFSA at 07:19 pm on 02.12.2022. The witness 
volunteered that the case property including currency 
notes were also deposited in the main malkhana on 
02.12.2022 through separate road certificate No. 637. The 
PFSA collection center Sahiwal is situated at a distance of 

Crl. Appeal No. 56371 of 2023   
 
 
5 
about 55 km from malkhana Saddar Depalpur and it may 
consumed about one hour. The office of PFSA collection 
Center Sahiwal remains open at 08:00 am till 04:00 p.m.  
 
It is astonishing to note here that Azam Ali S.I/complainant 
(PW.5) admitted during his cross-examination that according to 
road certificate (Exh.DD), on 02.12.2022 at 09:28 a.m. the 
remaining case property was transmitted from police station to 
main malkhana and same was deposited in the office of main 
malkhana on 02.12.2022 at 07:10 p.m. whereas according to road 
certificate (Exh.DC), sample parcels were transmitted from police 
station to the office of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Collection 
Center, Sahiwal on 02.12.2022 at 09:21 a.m. which were deposited 
in the said agency at 07:19 p.m. on the same date. According to his 
(PW.5) own testimony, the office of the said agency was located at 
a distance of 55 kilometers away from malkhana Saddar Depalpur 
and it took one hour to reach there. The question as to how he 
(PW.5), after depositing the remaining case property in the office 
of main malkhana on 02.12.2022 at 07:10 p.m. could have reached 
at the office of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Collection Center, 
Sahiwal, from main malkhana within just nine minutes i.e. at 07:19 
p.m. on 02.12.2022, has not been satisfactorily answered by the 
prosecution, making the safe transmission of sample parcels to the 
office of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Collection Center, 
Sahiwal, highly doubtful. 
Similarly, the testimony of Husnain Raza 938/HC (PW.6), 
who was posted as moharrar at Police Station Hujra Shah Muqeem, 
is also fairly imprecise and raises serious concerns regarding his 
capability being a reliable witness. He (PW.6) stated that on 
28.11.2022, Umar Farooq S.I/I.O (PW.7) handed over to him seven 
sealed parcels, which included six parcels containing charas and 
one parcel containing cash amounting to Rs.850/- for safe custody. 
He (PW.6) further deposed that on 02.12.2022, he handed over 
three sealed sample parcels of charas and four parcels of remaining 
case property to Azam Ali S.I/complainant (PW.5), who 

Crl. Appeal No. 56371 of 2023   
 
 
6 
subsequently deposited three sample parcels in the Punjab Forensic 
Science Agency, Collection Center, Sahiwal intact and Azam Ali 
S.I/complainant (PW.5) also stated during his examination-in-chief 
on the same lines, but during cross-examination upon Husnain 
Raza 938/HC (PW.6) when he was confronted with the entries 
available in Register No.XIX, he frankly conceded that the details 
of the case property and parcels which were handed over to him at 
the police station were notably missing. This omission undermines 
the clarity and reliability of the chain of custody, which is 
undoubtedly a crucial aspect under the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 
1984, for sustaining the evidentiary value in criminal proceedings 
in our country. The absence of proper entries in the official register 
may affect the probative value of this testimony and calls for 
careful judicial scrutiny. For convenience, relevant lines of his 
testimony read as under:- 
“…I have seen manual copy of register No.19 and all the 
entries regarding the present case are correctly entered in 
it. Column No.4 and registered No.19 deals with the case 
property/parcel which are handed over to Moharrar at 
police station. Column No.5 & 6 deals regarding the 
transmission of case property from police station to the 
quarters concerned. It is correct that in column No.4 in 
register No.19 the detail of parcels/case property were 
only mentioned which were sent to the office of PFSA and 
main Malkhana. It is correct that in any column registered 
No.19 detail of case property/parcels which were handed 
over to me at police station is not mentioned….” 
 
In the light of above noted discrepancy in the statement of 
Husnain Raza 938/HC (PW.6), the matter before us necessitates a 
comprehensive judicial examination of the critical role and 
mandatory nature of Register No.XIX, formally designated as the 
Store-Room Register under Rule 22.70 of the Punjab Police Rules, 
1934. This register is not a procedural formality but an 
indispensable cornerstone of criminal justice, particularly where the 
prosecution relies upon the seizure and custody of case property. Its 
meticulous maintenance is judicially imperative to safeguard the 
integrity of the evidentiary process, which is foundational to the 

Crl. Appeal No. 56371 of 2023   
 
 
7 
fair trial guarantee. We may observe here that this register 
functions as the primary, contemporaneous, and verifiable 
documentary account for every article deposited into the police 
station's malkhana (store-room), excluding items logged in Register 
No. XVI. The statutory mandate under Rule 22.70 ibid is 
prescriptive, demanding the recording of specific data fields, 
including the sequential serial number, FIR details, the date and 
name of the depositing official, a detailed description of the 
property, disposal references, the method and date of disposal, and 
the 
recipient’s 
signature. 
This 
structured 
requirement 
is 
fundamentally designed to establish and preserve the unbroken 
chain of custody for all seized items. This chain is the mechanism 
by which the trial court verifies that the case property, such as illicit 
narcotics under the stringent Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 
1997, or other tangible exhibits, has remained secure and unaltered 
from the point of recovery until its production in Court. The 
integrity of this chain is a non-negotiable prerequisite for upholding 
the reliability of the evidence. Furthermore, the maintenance of 
Register No.XIX finds supplementary statutory support in Section 
44 of the Police Act, 1861, and Section 167 of the Police Order, 
2002, which mandate the recording of all properties taken into 
possession in the daily diaries (Register No.2 or Roznamcha). 
Register No.XIX complements this by providing the definitive 
custodial history within the malkhana. The integrity of this record 
is highly secured by the Punjab Police Rules, 1934, as Rule 22.45 
designates it an essential record and Rule 22.46 strictly forbids any 
unauthorized alteration, requiring the express sanction of the 
Inspector General of Police. These Rules demand that the entries be 
made neatly, paginated, and, most importantly, logged immediately 
upon deposit, acting as a deliberate safeguard against tampering. 
In the context of the trial, the production of a complete and 
accurate Register No.XIX is a substantive evidentiary requirement, 
essential for corroborating the recovery memos, the FIR, and 

Crl. Appeal No. 56371 of 2023   
 
 
8 
testimonies of witnesses. Conversely, any demonstrable deficiency, 
omission, or inconsistency in the entries, such as failing to record 
the precise date, depositor's identity, or time of deposit, is 
consistently held by the Superior Court to constitute a fatal breach, 
rendering the chain of custody "broken." A broken chain of custody 
vitiates the evidentiary value of the seized material, fundamentally 
impairing the reliability of the prosecution’s case and attracting an 
adverse inference against the prosecution under Article 129(g) of 
the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. We may also observe here that 
the failure to maintain or produce complete Register No.XIX 
entries proves invariably fatal to the prosecution. Judicial 
precedents emphasize strict compliance with procedural mandates, 
in accordance with the maxim, "A communi observantia non est 
recedendum" (There must be no departure from established 
observance or rule). This rigorous standard is particularly crucial in 
narcotics cases, where the Government Analyst's report under 
Section 36 of the CNSA, read with Rules 5 and 6 of the Control of 
Narcotic Substances Government Analysts Rules, 2001, relies 
wholly upon the Court’s satisfaction that the sample transmitted 
was intact. Precedents from the Superior Court confirm that even 
minor material gaps concerning the custody record entitle the 
accused person to the benefit of doubt and subsequent acquittal. 
Register No.XIX, therefore, is the definitive judicial assurance 
against miscarriages of justice stemming from compromised 
evidence, and its meticulous compliance is essential for both 
evidentiary admissibility and maintaining the integrity of police 
malkhana operations. While holding so, we have been fortified by 
the dictum laid down in cases titled as “Khair-ul-Bashar vs. The 
State” (2019 SCMR 930) and “Jeehand vs. The State through 
Prosecutor General Balochistan” (2025 SCMR 923). In 
Jeehand’s case, the Supreme Court of Pakistan has been pleased 
to hold as under:-  
“…… We have noted that in the instant case, safe 

Crl. Appeal No. 56371 of 2023   
 
 
9 
custody and safe transmission of the alleged drugs from 
the spot of recovery till it’s receipt by the Narcotic 
Testing Laboratory are not satisfactorily established. The 
Police Rules mandate that case property be kept in the 
Malkhana and that the entry of the same be recorded in 
Register No. XIX of the said police station. It is the duty 
of the police and prosecution to establish that the case 
property was kept in safe custody, and if it was required 
to be sent to any laboratory for analysis, to further 
establish its safe transmission and that the same was also 
recorded in the relevant register, including the road 
certificate, etc. The procedure in the Police Rules ensures 
that the case property, when it is produced before the 
court, remains in safe custody and is not hampered with 
until that time. A complete mechanism is provided in the 
Police Rules qua safe custody and safe transmission of the 
case property to concerned laboratory and then to the 
Trial Court. 
 
Mr. Zakir Ali, in-charge store room, appeared as 
PW-3 and stated that on 31 October 2020, the 
investigating officer, Liaquat Ali, handed over parcels 
Nos. 1 to 104 and the Corolla car to him which he entered 
in Registered No. XIX. On 1 November 2020 after 
receiving English docket, he sent the parcels to Karachi 
Laboratory through Muhammad Rahim, however, the said 
witness did not produce copy of Register No. XIX. 
Keeping in view the glaring contradiction between the 
statements of said witness recorded under section 161 
Cr.P.C. and statement recorded before the Trial Court in 
respect of number of parcels handed over to him by the 
investigating officer, the prosecution should have proved 
the safe custody of parcels by production of Register No. 
XIX in which entry was made regarding receipt and 
placing of parcels in the store room. Under Article 129(g) 
of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 ("the Order") it can be 
presumed that the prosecution did not produce Register 
No. XIX because the in-charge of the store room had not 
entered the receipt of parcels in the said register. Under 
Article 102 of the Order, in all cases in which any matter 
is required by law to be reduced to the form of a 
document, no evidence shall be given in proof of such 
matter except the document itself, or secondary evidence 
of its contents in cases in which secondary evidence is 
admissible under Article 76. Therefore, oral testimony of 
PW-3 with regard to the safe custody of parcels was not 
admissible under Article 102 of the Order. Hence 
prosecution failed to prove safe custody of the parcels 
beyond shadow of doubt. 
ii) It is a case of prior information that too in the 
court timings but the seizing officer neither tried to 
obtain search warrants as required by section 20 of 
the Act of 1997 nor he has offered any 
reason/justification for his non-compliance of the 

Crl. Appeal No. 56371 of 2023   
 
 
10 
command of section 20. Similarly, the prior 
information was never recorded in Register No. II 
as contemplated by rule 22.49 (n) of the Police 
Rules. This Court, in the case of Zain Shahid v. 
State (2024 SCMR 843), in paragraph 8 has 
observed as under: 
 
"The case against the petitioner was initiated upon 
a spy information, but such information was not 
reduced into writing. Fair play demands that spy 
information should be reduced into writing in order 
to safeguard innocent persons against false 
implication." 
6. 
Upon being confronted with the above-noted inconsistencies 
in the prosecution’s case, learned Deputy Prosecutor General could 
not provide any satisfactory explanation to the Court’s queries. 
Consequently, 
these 
material 
contradictions 
render 
the 
prosecution’s case fraught with discrepancies and made the same 
fundamentally unreliable. We, therefore, quite comfortably and 
confidently hold that the prosecution has not satisfactorily 
established the safe custody of the case property as well as the 
sample parcels from the place of occurrence to the police station. 
Moreover, the subsequent transmission of the sample parcels from 
the police station to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency is also 
cast in serious doubt. It is an established legal principle that the 
prosecution bears the burden to demonstrate that the chain of 
custody of both the case property and the separated sample parcels 
throughout remains intact, un-impeached, indisputable, safe, and 
secure. Any breach or lapse in the chain of custody or control over 
the possession of the sample will unquestionably raise doubts over 
the safe custody and transmission of such samples, thereby 
impairing and vitiating the conclusiveness and reliability of the 
Government Analyst’s report. In the present case, the safe 
transmission of the parcels alleged to contain “charas” is, therefore, 
rendered doubtful. Reliance is placed on the case laws titled as 
“Ikramullah and others vs. The State” (2015 SCMR 1002), “Haji 
Nawaz vs. The State” (2020 SCMR 687), “Qaiser Khan vs. The 
State through Advocate-General, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar” 

Crl. Appeal No. 56371 of 2023   
 
 
11 
(2021 SCMR 363), “Abdul Ghani vs. The State” (2022 SCMR 
2121), “Shah Zameen vs. The State” (2022 SCMR 2149) and “Asif 
Ali and another vs. The State through Prosecutor General Punjab” 
(2024 SCMR 1408). 
7. 
At this juncture, we do not find it out of place to ponder upon 
the emphasis laid by learned Deputy Prosecutor General that the 
prosecution witnesses, all police officials, consistently supported 
the prosecution’s case during their examination-in-chief but 
conceded advantageous points for the defense under cross-
examination. The Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 provides the 
governing framework for recording, challenging and evaluating 
witness’s testimony. Articles 150 and 151 of the Order ibid are 
relevant when a prosecution witness deviates from his earlier 
statement or gives evidence favourable to the accused. Article 150 
of the Order ibid empowers the Court, in its discretion, to allow the 
prosecution to treat its own witness as hostile. Likewise, Article 
151 of the Order ibid permits impeachment of the witness’s credit. 
These provisions collectively ensure that the truthfulness of 
testimony is tested and that deviations from earlier statements are 
properly dealt. For the purpose of clarity, Article 150 of the Qanun-
e-Shahadat Order, 1984, is reproduced as infra: 
“150. Question by party to his own witness.–The Court 
may, in its discretion, permit the person who calls a 
witness to put any questions to him which might be put in 
cross-examination by the adverse party.”  
 
In the overall perspective, once a prosecution witness 
assumes a concessional posture, the law obliges the prosecution to 
act with due diligence and in strict adherence to Articles 150 and 
151 of the Order ibid. This includes seeking permission to treat the 
witness as hostile, confronting him with earlier statements except 
recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C. for the purpose of contradiction 
and impeaching his credit where necessary. The jurisprudence of 
this Court leaves no doubt that omission to adopt these measures 
results in the favourable portion of the testimony standing admitted. 

Crl. Appeal No. 56371 of 2023   
 
 
12 
However, observance of these safeguards is essential for 
maintaining the integrity of the prosecution’s case and for ensuring 
that the evidentiary process conforms to the statutory mandate. The 
Supreme Court of Pakistan has also, on multiple occasions, 
reiterated that when a prosecution witness deviates from the 
prosecution case or tends to favour the accused, it becomes 
incumbent upon the prosecution to invoke aforementioned statutory 
provisions and if the prosecution acts as a silent spectator, then 
adverse testimony, which is not checked, attains binding effect for 
extending its benefit to the accused, meaning thereby, the 
prosecution ought to have sought a declaration of hostility and its 
failure to do so materially weakened its own case. In this context, 
we have been guided by the pronouncement of the Supreme Court 
of Pakistan in cases reported as “Muhammad Boota and another vs. 
The State and another” (1984 SCMR 560) and “Mukhtar Ahmad 
vs. The State” (2003 SCMR 1374).  
Coming to the issue involved in the case in hands, no doubt 
is left that the prosecution remained passive during cross-
examination upon its material witnesses, failing to challenge 
evasive or concessionary answers given by them, nor sought to 
declare any witness hostile for this purpose. This conduct reflects 
the prosecution’s implicit acceptance of the doubts raised by its 
own witnesses, undermining the prosecution’s case. 
8. 
The Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, provides 
severe penalties on those engaged in narcotics-related offences, for 
the reason, very strong and credible evidence is required to secure 
conviction against the offender. However, such evidence is absent 
in this case, making the prosecution’s case highly doubtful. It is a 
settled principle of law that the accused is not required to establish 
multiple circumstances creating doubt in the prosecution case 
rather single circumstance casting reasonable doubt in a prudent 
mind suffices to acquit the accused. This case is replete with such 
circumstances that raise serious doubts about the prosecution's case 

Crl. Appeal No. 56371 of 2023   
 
 
13 
against the appellant, benefit of which must be given to him as a 
matter of right and not of grace. Reliance is placed upon the case 
laws titled as “Ahmed Ali and another vs. The State” (2023 
SCMR 781) and “Farman Ali and another vs. The State” (2025 
SCMR 1730).  
9. 
For the reasons discussed above, we find the prosecution 
evidence gravely insufficient, rendering the conviction and 
sentence of the appellant by the trial court unsustainable in the eye 
of law. Accordingly, we allow the appeal, set aside the impugned 
judgment dated 17.07.2023, and acquit the appellant of the charge. 
The appellant, in custody, shall be released immediately unless 
required to be kept in jail in connection with any other case. The 
case property i.e. charas, shall be dealt with according to law, as 
directed by the trial court in the impugned judgment.  
10. 
Before parting with this judgment, we would like to observe 
here that we have frequently encountered instances, particularly in 
narcotics cases, where Law Officers representing the State have 
failed to discharge their statutory and professional duties diligently 
during the recording of statements of prosecution witnesses and 
other proceedings of the case. This recurring deficiency undermines 
the prosecution’s case and calls for strict adherence to procedural 
responsibilities in future proceedings. We have, therefore, observed 
with concern that, 
1. Certain Law Officers remain passive or silent 
spectators during the examination-in-chief and cross-
examination of prosecution witnesses as well as 
statement(s) under Section 342 Cr.P.C. of accused and 
defence evidence, particularly in cases registered 
under the narcotics laws. 
2. Police officials, while appearing as prosecution 
witnesses, sometimes deliberately offer concessions to 
the accused or depose in a manner that weakens the 
prosecution case. 
3. Such conduct creates loopholes in the prosecution 
evidence, resulting in the accused obtaining undue 
benefit and ultimately being acquitted on technical or 
evidentiary grounds. The Law Officers do not bother 
to recommend departmental legal action against the

We have observed with serious concern that the escalating 
threat posed by drug traffickers severely undermines societal peace 
and disproportionately impacts youth. Distressingly, daily reports 
confirm the apprehension of numerous drug peddlers. This menace 
not only endangers public tranquillity but also finances anti-state 
and terrorist activities that have plagued the country for decades. 
The Court has emphasized that the integrity of narcotics trials 
hinges on the proactive, competent, and vigilant conduct of Law 
Officers, who must ensure that no witness undermines the 
prosecution's case and that every deviation is promptly addressed 
per legal mandates. This Court has expressed serious concern over 
this recurrent issue, emphasizing that the role of the Law Officer 
transcends mere formality as the Law Officer is duty-bound to 
actively assist the Court, uphold the interests of justice, and ensure 
that the prosecution’s case is presented with utmost diligence, 
clarity, and legal precision. To address these deficiencies and 
prevent miscarriage of justice, this Court issues the following 
directions: 
1. All Law Officers must remain vigilant, active, and 
fully engaged during the recording of prosecution 
evidence, statement(s) of accused under Section 342 
Cr.P.C. and defence evidence, especially in narcotics 
cases where the margin of error could lead to the 
acquittal of drug traffickers. 
2. Where any prosecution witness, including a police 
official, deviates from the facts or intentionally makes 
statements favorable to the accused, the Law Officer 
must immediately invoke the powers under Articles 
150 and 151 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, 
which permit asking questions to test the veracity, 
credibility, and conduct of the witness. 
3. Law Officers must not allow any intentional or 
unintentional concessions granted by police witnesses 
to go unchallenged. They are required to take 
appropriate legal steps to protect the prosecution’s 
case. They should recommend departmental legal

action against the police officials/witnesses who give 
concessional statements in favour of accused.  
4. The Prosecutor General Punjab, Lahore is also 
directed to personally look into this matter, identify 
the causes leading to weak prosecution, and take 
necessary 
steps 
to 
ensure 
accountability 
and 
improvement in 
performance. 
He 
shall issue 
comprehensive instructions to all Law Officers across 
Punjab to strictly follow the legal procedure and 
exercise their authority under Articles 150 and 151 of 
the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, during trial 
proceedings. 
5. Failure to comply with these directions must result in 
disciplinary action, as no negligence on part of the 
State’s legal representatives should be tolerated where 
the administration of justice is compromised. 
We also direct the Registrar of this Court to dispatch the 
copies of this judgment to the Secretary, Law and Parliamentary 
Affairs Department, Government of the Punjab, Lahore, the 
Prosecutor General Punjab, Lahore, the Director General, Anti-
Narcotic Force, Islamabad and the Inspector General of Police, 
Punjab, Lahore, with the direction to enforce the above-noted 
measures vigorously for the noble purpose of upholding the justice 
so as to curb such a societal scourge of drug peddling.
