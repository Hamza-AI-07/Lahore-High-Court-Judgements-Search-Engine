The petitioners through the instant constitutional 
petition have called into question their purported exclusion 
from the list of successful candidates qua process initiated 
for recruitment as Senior Station Assistant (SSA) and 
Police Station Assistant (PSA) in Punjab Police against 
vacant posts. Background of the case is that by a public 
notice (annex “A”) issued under the authority of DIG 
(Establishment-II), Central Police Office, Lahore invited 
applications for induction as Senior Station Assistant 
(SSA) and Police Station Assistant (PSA) in which the 
petitioners, aspiring to be inducted as Police Station 
Assistants (PSA) submitted their applications, cleared their 
written test and were called for interview but when the list 
of final candidates was put up dated 30.9.2023 (annex “D) 
their names were not reflected and as per their version they 
were owed an explanation for this however none came 
forth and thereafter a fresh public notice was issued for

    -2- 
 
 
second round of recruitment against the remaining vacant 
posts of Senior Station Assistant (SSA) and Police Station 
Assistant (PSA) under the authority of AIG (Admin and 
Security), Central Police Office, Lahore. 
2. 
Through the instant constitutional petition the 
grievance is voiced by the petitioners that their names were 
liable to be included in the list of successful candidates 
dated 30.9.2023 as they had cleared written test as well as 
the interviews. Report in this regard was requisitioned. 
Stance taken from the other side is that the petitioners who 
were all applicants for the posts of Police Station Assistant 
(PSA) from Lahore District, were required to possess 
typing proficiency in Urdu and English which was 
necessary to discharge the duties connected to the post for 
which they were applying and this was specifically 
recorded in the advertisement given in the press annex “A” 
and said standing requirement is equally reflected in the 
subsequent advertisement annex “E” to effect another 
round. As amplification of the second advertisement it is 
submitted that merit was served in processing applicants 
from the first round that included the petitioners, a limited 
number of the total that applied met the criteria who were 
recruited and to fill leftover vacancies with quality 
candidates, a second round is taking place.

3. 
Scrutiny of the stipulation in this respect as featured 
in the advertisements shows that the applicants are 
required to have inter alia Intermediate in Computer 
Sciences (ICS), Computer Certificate from any approved 
institution (MS Office) although BS/BSc would be given 
preference and along with this specified minimum typing 
speed in both Urdu (25 WPM) and in English (35 WPM) 
was necessary.   
4. 
Stance taken by senior personnel from the Police 
Department before the Court based on the report was to the 
effect that the petitioners had in fact remained unsuccessful 
in the typing test and that their proficiency in Urdu and 
English typing was below the criteria published. As 
learned counsel for the petitioner had taken the stance that 
call for interview implied clearance in other areas of 
eligibility, as such, they were liable to be appointed, this 
was confronted to them. The explanation given in this 
regard was that transmission of interview call was based 
on error and that the typing criteria had to be met in which 
the petitioners had failed and were resultantly not reflected 
in the list dated 30.9.2023.  
5. 
They were asked to produce pertinent documents in 
this regard. Today computerized typing test result of each 
petitioner has been submitted along with comprehensive 
list containing data of 264 candidates from Lahore District

out of which 46 were successful. Such computerized 
typing test results are given in individual format for each 
petitioner with the inscription that the same are system 
generated reports that do not require any signatures 
according to which the petitioners have obtained the

It is explained that each candidate is made to type a 
specimen directly into the provided computers in English 
and Urdu during the assessment process and evaluation is 
made within the system, based on the preserved specimens 
of their performance. As per these results none of them 
equaled or exceeded the criteria as notified qua the 

W.P. No.67948 of 2023 
    -5- 
 
 
ambidextrous typing proficiency in Urdu and English 
based on which it is submitted by the learned Law Officer 
that not having met the criteria qua typing speed they could 
not be inducted as merit had to be followed in public 
service and applicants to be considered against the 
particular posts had to meet all criteria including the typing 
skills necessary to effectively and efficiently discharge the 
work for which they were to be taken on board.  
6. 
Regardless of whether they were called for interview 
the fact of the matter is that the petitioners had failed to 
meet the criteria qua typing proficiency. This being so their 
insistence on yet being inducted did not appear to require 
consideration in discretionary jurisdiction especially when 
the process is reinitiated which is open.  
7.     Learned counsel for the petitioners at this point 
wishes to assail typing results by reiterating that the call 
for interview should necessarily entail the conclusion that 
they cleared all criteria. There does not appear to be any 
warrant for such assumption to be made in abstraction on 
some a priori basis nor could a technical evaluative 
exercise carried out on merits at the competent 
departmental level be discredited on such tenuous 
abstraction as suggested. As to aspersion on veracity of 
results, as being impliedly cast, the same presupposes the 
unjustified expectation that embarking on an exercise for 

W.P. No.67948 of 2023 
    -6- 
 
 
reliable resolution of factual controversy that may present, 
shall be practicable in summary jurisdiction of this Court 
under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic 
of Pakistan, 1973. It is observed that presumption of 
regularity attached to official acts, could not be dislodged 
on the basis of bald assertions, by candidates who 
participated in the recruitment process but remained 
unsuccessful which unfortunately appears to be the case at 
hand. This is especially in stark relief when in the 
pleadings no material particularization of any mala fide is 
recorded or any other ground established as to give any 
substance to the assertion that the petitioners despite 
having failed in typing test were yet liable to be appointed.
