 Muhammad Amjad Rafiq, J:- This revision petition calls 
in question, the order dated 07.06.2023 passed by the learned 
Additional Sessions Judge, Muzaffargarh, whereby application filed by 
the petitioner for recalling of order dated 07.03.2023 was dismissed.  
2.        The facts of the case framed Muhammad Imran/respondent No.2 
as accused of FIR No. 48/21 dated 08.02.202 u/s 302/34/109 PPC 
police station Mahmood Kot, District Muzaffargarh, with a joint role of 
causing injuries with knife on the person of Muhammad Arif deceased 
father of the complainant. Initially, Muhammad Imran was found 
innocent during investigation, therefore, he withdrew his petition for 
pre-arrest bail on 10.03.2021 from the Court presided by Additional 
Sessions Judge/MCTC, Kot Adu. Consequently, his name was placed 
in column No. 2 of report u/s 173 Cr.P.C. (the Code) while co-accused 
Muhammad Tariq was challaned in column No.3 of said report. Later 
due to change of investigation, DSP entrusted with investigation opined 
against the respondent at his back, which was intervened through filing 
a writ petition No. 7347/21; upon which investigation was entrusted to 
DIG Dera Ghazi Khan and in the meantime, respondent No.2 had also 

                        Criminal Revision No.255 of 2023 
                         
                                                                                                                                  2 
 
filed another petition for pre-arrest bail but withdrew the same on 
28.10.2021 from the Court presided by Additional Sessions Judge, 
Muzaffargarh because the investigation was pending but surprisingly a 
report u/s 173 the Code dated 17.03.2023 was prepared at the back of 
respondent No.2 showing him as absconder for proceedings under 
section 512 of the Code, and it was forwarded to the Court on 
18.03.2023, but by the time trial was in progress and on the application 
of petitioner/complainant for summoning of accused/respondent No. 2, 
he was summoned to face trial by virtue of order dated 07.02.2023 and 
consequent thereupon he was before the Court on 07.03.2023 well 
before filing of report styled as under section 512 of the Code. copies 
under section 265C of the Code was delivered to him on the same day 
and he was taken on trial.  
3.      Learned Counsel for the petitioner states that without granting bail 
to an accused he cannot be taken on trial while accepting his bond under 
section 91 of the Code for his appearance, and was of the view that 
section 91 of the Code is only applicable to the proceedings in a private 
complaint case. It was controverted by learned counsel for the 
respondent by relying on judgments cited in the impugned order. 
However, learned DPG has stated that though State has not assailed that 
order but respondent No.2 being absconder in a case of murder must 
not have been taken on trial just on his executing a bond under section 
91 of the Code. If this practice persists or is given a go, then offenders 
would prefer to be at large till their summoning by the Court for trial, 
and just by executing a bond they would simply avoid their arrest, 
which would affect and hamper the investigation.  
4.       Heard; record perused 
5.     Before dilating upon the legal query involved in the case, it is 
necessary to see how the learned trial Court attended the situation. The 
order dated 07.03.2023 was when assailed before the learned trial 
Court, it while declining the request to recall the same passed the 
impugned order dated 07.06.2023 with following observations:- 

                        Criminal Revision No.255 of 2023 
                         
                                                                                                                                  3 
 
“Record goes to reveal that initially report u/s 173 Cr.P.C. was 
submitted to the extent of Tariq accused while placing his name in 
column No. 3. Subsequently, on 21.05.2021 report u/s 173 Cr.P.C. was 
submitted to the extent of accused Muhammad Imran and Ghulam 
Hussain while placing their names in its column No.2, therefore, said 
accused persons were not summoned by the court till that time. On 
09.06.2021 charge was framed only against the accused Muhammad 
Tariq. On 01.02.2023, examination in chief of two prosecution 
witnesses was recorded. In the light of recorded evidence and finding 
sufficient incriminating material against accused Imran he was also 
summoned to face the trial vide order dated 27.02.2023. Upon his first 
appearance in the court, the court while relying upon 2017 YLR 1296 
(Pesh), 2014 SCMR 1762 & 2015 SCMR 56 directed the accused to 
furnish his surety bonds u/s 91 of Cr.P.C. for his future appearance in 
the court. The accused Muhammad Imran is appearing before this 
court regularly. The complainant has failed to assign any valid reason 
for recalling of order dated 07.03.2023 passed by this court. Hence 
the petition in hand is devoid of merits stands dismissed.”  
 
6.       Responding to the questions raised by learned counsel for the 
petitioner that as to whether applicability of section 91 of the Code is 
limited to trial in private complaint only or it as a part of sub-chapter-
D of Chapter VI of the Code, “Other Rules regarding Processes” being 
of general nature is applicable to State case as well, the case reported 
as “SARWAR and others Versus The STATE and others” (2014 SCMR 1762) 
is referred, wherein Hon’ble Supreme Court while referring sections 
91, 190 & 204 of the Code, has held that after taking cognizance of an 
offence by the Court through any of three modes as mentioned in 
section 190, followed by commencement of proceedings under section 
204, it has power to take bond from the accused under section 91 of the 
Code, in order to secure his presence during the trial. This view also 
finds its place in following cases reported as “BARKATULLAH Versus 
The STATE and another” (2017 YLR 1296); “MUSTAFA and others Versus 
THE STATE” (2009 YLR 1375); NOOR “MUHAMMAD IJAZ Verus 
NADEEM and 3 others” (PLD 2006 Lahore 227); For reference section 
91 of the Code is reproduced as under:- 
91. Power to take bond for appearance. When any person for whose 
appearance or arrest the officer presiding in any Court is empowered to 
issue a summon or warrant, is present in such Court, such officer may 
require such person to execute a bond, with or without sureties, for his 
appearance in such Court.  
 
 

                        Criminal Revision No.255 of 2023 
                         
                                                                                                                                  4 
 
In the case cited above as 2014 SCMR 1762 while approving case 
reported as “Mazhar Hussain Shah v. The State” (1986 P Cr. LJ 2359) and 
affirming case reported as “Syed Muhammad Firdaus and others v. The 
State” (2005 SCMR 784) & “Reham Dad v. Syed Mazhar Hussain Shah 
and others” (Criminal Appeal No.56 of 1986), Hon’ble Supreme Court 
has held that  it is not necessary that an accused of non-bailable offence 
must be granted bail before asking him to execute bond with or without 
sureties under section 91 of the Code because provisions of section 91 
and 497 of the Code are meant for different situations.  
“(i) A process is issued to an accused person under section 204, 
Cr.P.C. when the court taking cognizance of the offence is of the 
"opinion" that there is "sufficient ground" for "proceeding" 
against the accused person and an opinion of a court about 
availability of sufficient ground for proceeding against an 
accused person cannot be equated with appearance of 
"reasonable grounds" to the court for "believing" that he "has 
been guilty" of an offence within the contemplation of subsection 
(1) of section 497, Cr.P.C. Due to these differences in the words 
used in section 204 and section 497, Cr.P.C. the intent of the 
legislature becomes apparent that the provisions of section 91, 
Cr.P.C. and section 497, Cr.P.C. are meant to cater for different 
situations.” 
  
In the said judgment, however, it was suggested that on summoning 
under section 204 of the Code, accused can apply for his pre-arrest bail 
which may or may not be granted depending upon the circumstances of 
the case but even in such a case upon appearance of the accused before 
the Court, the Court in its discretion can require him to execute a bond 
with or without sureties for his future appearance.  
7.      When a bond is taken under section 91 of the Code, question of 
bail does not arise because “bail is only for continued appearance of a 
person and not to prevent him from committing certain acts” as held by 
Supreme Court of India in a case reported as “MADHU LIMAYE Vs. SUB-
DIVISIONAL MAGISTRATE, MONGHYR & ORS.” (1971 AIR 2486). 
Likewise, in a cited case “SARWAR and others Versus The STATE and others” 
(2014 SCMR 1762), it was held by Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan 
that issuance of warrant, bailable or non-bailable is meant only to 

                        Criminal Revision No.255 of 2023 
                         
                                                                                                                                  5 
 
procure attendance of an accused person before the Court and not for 
any other purpose.  
 
8.        Now I take up the contention of learned DPG that if bond under 
section 91 of the Code is accepted without asking for bail in each and 
every case of non-bailable offence, then offenders would not join the 
investigation rather prefer to be at large till their summoning by the 
Court for trial. It is misconception that the Court in every case in an 
omnibus manner shall direct the offender to execute a bond on his 
appearance before the Court to face the trial. The word “may” used in 
section 91 of the Code is when read in the light of section 351 of the 
Code, makes it clear that if the Court deems appropriate can commit the 
accused to custody for the purpose of trial. Section is reproduced as 
under:- 
351.   Detention of offenders attending Court. (1) Any person 
attending a Criminal Court, although not under arrest or upon a 
summons, may be detained by such Court for the purpose of inquiry 
into or trial of any offence of which such Court can take cognizance 
and which, form the evidence, may appear to have been committed and 
may be proceeded against as though he had been arrested or 
summoned. 
 
(2) When the detention take place […..] after a trial has been begun 
the proceedings in respect of such person shall be commenced afresh, 
and the witnesses re-heard.  
 
This section clearly speaks that even if accused is not under arrest or 
upon a summons, the Court is still authorized to detain him if he is 
present before the Court and against whom evidence is available of 
committing an offence.  In a case reported as “THE STATE Versus NATHE 
KHAN AND 5 others” (1969 P Cr. L J 378), when in a commitment  
proceedings statement of four witnesses were recorded, a request was 
made to summon the sixth accused whose name figured in column              
No. 2 of the report under section 173 of the Code. He was summoned 
accordingly and directed to execute a bond for his appearance during 
the inquiry but after completing committal proceedings, learned 
Magistrate while finding evidence against him arrested the accused and 
sent him to custody pursuant to section 351 of the Code and then 

                        Criminal Revision No.255 of 2023 
                         
                                                                                                                                  6 
 
committed him to trial before the Sessions Court. It was held that when 
such a person is included in the category of accused then it becomes 
imperative on the part of Magistrate under sub-section (2) of Section 
351 of the Code to have examined all the witness afresh. The High 
Court did not disturb the detention except declaring the commitment of 
accused to trial as illegal.    
9.      Thus, when an accused is summoned to face the trial, the Court 
has two options, either to ask him to execute bond with or without 
sureties under section 91 of the Code for his continued appearance 
before the Court during the trial or commit him to custody as per section 
351 of the Code if the evidence is available that he has committed the 
offence. His such detention shall then be regulated under section 344 of 
the Code in order to remand him to custody from time to time and at an 
appropriate stage his request for bail u/s 497 of the Code can be 
entertained.  
10.       Keeping in view the above discussion, impugned order dated 
07.06.2023 
passed 
by 
learned 
Additional 
Sessions 
Judge, 
Muzaffargarh/trial Court calls for no interference as perfect in the 
circumstances. Consequently, instant criminal revision is dismissed.
