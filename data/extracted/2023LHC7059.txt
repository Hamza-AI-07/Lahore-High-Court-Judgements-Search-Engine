3. 
Precisely, the necessary facts of the prosecution case, as narrated by 
Muhammad Ali (PW-1), the complainant  of the case, are as under:- 
“ Stated that on 11.12.2021 at about 10.00 am. my father Jam Siraj

Irshad Saeed present before this court, facing trial, had sold his landed 
property measuring 05 acres to one Haji Raffaqat showing our 15/20 
feet Banna towards his side. My father came at his landed property, as

7.    
 On 22.01.2022, the complainant gave up the prosecution witness 
namely Muhammad Akram  as being unnecessary. On 17.09.2022, the 
complainant gave up the prosecution witnesses namely Sajid Hussain and 
Muhammad Akbar  as being unnecessary. On 19.09.2022, the learned 
Assistant District Public Prosecutor closed the prosecution evidence after 
tendering in evidence, the reports of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, 
Lahore (Exh.PS, Exh.PT and Exh.PU). 
 
8. 
After the closure of prosecution evidence, the learned trial court 
examined the appellant namely Irshad Saeed son of Saeed Ahmed   under 
section 342 Cr.P.C. and in answer to the question why this case against you 
and why the P.W.s have deposed against you, he replied that he had been 
involved in the case falsely and was innocent. The appellant namely Irshad 
Saeed son of Saeed Ahmed   opted not to get himself examined under section 
340(2) Cr.P.C. and did not adduce any evidence in his defence.  
9. 
On the conclusion of the trial, the learned Additional Sessions Judge, 
Liaquatpur convicted and sentenced the appellant as referred to above.   
10. 
The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant precisely is that 
the whole case is fabricated and false and the prosecution remained unable to 
prove the facts in issue and did not produce any unimpeachable, admissible, 
and relevant evidence. Learned counsel for the appellant further contended 
that the story of the prosecution mentioned in the statements of the witnesses, 
on the face of it, was highly improbable. Learned counsel for the appellant 
further contended that the statements of the prosecution witnesses were not 
worthy of any reliance. The learned counsel for the appellant also argued that 

Murder Reference No. 35  of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 597 of 2022 
 
 
8 
 
the appellant had been involved in the occurrence due to suspicion alone. The 
learned counsel for the appellant finally submitted that the prosecution had 
totally failed to prove the case against the accused beyond the shadow of a 
doubt.   
11. 
On the other hand, the learned Deputy Prosecutor General along with 
the learned counsels for the complainant, contended that the prosecution had 
proved its case beyond the shadow of a doubt by producing independent 
witnesses. The learned Deputy Prosecutor General along with the learned 
counsels for the complainant, further argued that the deceased died as a result 
of injuries suffered at the hands of the appellant. The learned Deputy 
Prosecutor General along with the learned counsels for the complainant 
further contended that the medical evidence also corroborated the statements 
of Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem (PW-2). The learned Deputy 
Prosecutor General along with the learned counsels for the complainant 
further argued that the recoveries of the Motorcycle (P-10) and the pistol (P-
9)  from the appellant also corroborated the ocular account. The learned 
Deputy Prosecutor General alongwith the learned counsels for the 
complainant contended that there was no occasion for the prosecution 
witnesses, who were related to the deceased, to substitute the real offender 
with the innocent in this case. Lastly, they prayed for the rejection of the 
appeal. 
12. 
We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant, the learned 
counsels for the complainant, the learned Deputy Prosecutor General and with 
their able assistance, perused the record and evidence recorded during the 
trial.

13. 
The ocular account of the incident was narrated by the prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem (PW-2). The 
relationship of the said witnesses with the deceased is on record. Siraj Ahmad 
(deceased) was the father of the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ali 
(PW-1) and the paternal uncle of the prosecution witness namely Abdul 
Kareem (PW-2). The prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1)   
and Abdul Kareem (PW-2)  were also admittedly not the residents of the place 
of occurrence. According to the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad 
Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem (PW-2), both of them had their residences at 
a distance of about 09 acres from the place of occurrence. The prosecution 
witness namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1), during cross-examination stated as 
under:- 
“Banna, i.e. place of occurrence is at a distance of 8/9 acres away from my 
house. Even the houses of rest of the Pws are also situated at the same 
distance.” (emphasis supplied) 
Even the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Naeem Patwari (PW-4) 
admitted during cross-examination that the houses of the prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem (PW-2) were 
not shown by him in the scaled site plan of the place of occurrence (Exh.PJ) 
as prepared by him. Muhammad Naeem Patwari (PW-4), during cross-
examination, stated as under:- 
“Houses of complainant and Pws were not pointed out to me at the time of 
preparation of site plan,” 

Murder Reference No. 35  of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 597 of 2022 
 
 
10 
 
In this manner, both the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-
1) and Abdul Kareem (PW-2)  can be validly termed as “chance witnesses” 
and therefore were under a bounden duty to provide a convincing reason for 
their presence at the place of occurrence, at the time of occurrence and were 
also under a duty to prove their presence by producing some physical proof 
of the same. We have noted with grave concern that the prosecution witnesses 
namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem (PW-2)  failed miserably 
to provide any consistent evidence as to the reason for their arrival at the place 
of occurrence and their presence at the place of occurrence when the same 
was taking place. According to the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad 
Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem (PW-2), their reason for the arrival at the place 
of occurrence was that the deceased had a dispute with the appellant regarding 
the property of the deceased and it was for that reason that the prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem (PW-2) 
followed the deceased to the place of occurrence. The prosecution witness 
namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1), in his statement before the learned trial court 
stated as under:- 
“My father came at his landed property, as  there was previous dispute 
with the accused party, therefore I also came behind my father.” 
(emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Abdul Kareem (PW-2), in his statement 
before the learned trial court stated as under:- 
“My uncle went to see his landed property where I alongwith Muhammad 
Akram followed him.”  

Murder Reference No. 35  of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 597 of 2022 
 
 
11 
 
During the cross-examination, the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad 
Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem (PW-2) were badly exposed to have deposed 
falsely with regard to the reason mentioned by them in their statements before 
the learned trial court, for their arrival at the place of occurrence, at the time 
of occurrence. It was brought on record during the cross-examination of the 
prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem 
(PW-2) that the reason stated by them before the learned trial court for their 
arrival at the spot had not been mentioned by them either in the oral statement 
(Exh.PA) or in the statement recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C. During cross-
examination the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) was 
confronted with his oral statement (Exh.PA) and the learned trial court 
observed as under:- 
“I got recorded the reason of my presence at the spot, i.e. previous dispute 
of landed property with accused persons. Confronted with EX.P.A where it 
is recorded that motive is dispute of land, however it is not recorded that 
"as there was previous dispute with the accused party, therefore, I also 
came behind my father". I got recorded in Ex.P.A that my father replied 
to accused as you (accused) had occupied 15-20 Banna (land of deceased) 
towards his side and this is the reason of visit of deceased. Confronted with 
Ex.P.A wherein no such conversation between accused and deceased finds 
mentioned. 
………….. 
I did not get record in Ex.P.A that my father alone went to see his Banna. 
Confronted with Ex.P.A wherein it is so recorded.” (emphasis supplied)

12 
 
More important is the fact that according to the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem (PW-2), the occurrence took place 
when the deceased had come to his landed property however, the prosecution 
witness namely Muhammad Naeem Patwari (PW-4) admitted during cross-
examination that there was no landed property of the deceased at or around 
the place of occurrence. Muhammad Naeem Patwari (PW-4), during cross-
examination, stated as under:- 
“It is correct that it is nowhere mentioned in Ex.P.J as to who owns or 
possession the land situated in surroundings of the place of occurrence. 
There is no population in surroundings of place of occurrence. As water 
level in the area of occurrence is high, due to this, no crops had been 
cultivated in the land adjacent to the place of occurrence. One side of the 
place of occurrence, a matled road is situated whereas on the other side, a 
SAIM NALLA is situated. The said NALLA is 25/30 feet wide. There exists 
no bridge or PULLI. Drainage NALLA, place of occurrence, ie. Katcha Path 
shown in scaled site plan are of State Land. I have not shown any Banna 
in site plan.  
………. 
 On all around the place of occurrence, i.e. point No.1 to point No.4, 
State land is situated.” (emphasis supplied)  
Even the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) admitted during 
cross-examination that he did not produce any proof of ownership of any land 
which was owned by the deceased and which land he had gone to visit and 
was present at when the occurrence took place. The prosecution witness 
namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1), during cross-examination, admitted as 
under:- 

Murder Reference No. 35  of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 597 of 2022 
 
 
13 
 
“I did not produce any proof of ownership of any land at the spot throughout 
the investigation of this case.” 
Muhammad Riaz SI (PW-5), the Investigating Officer of the case, also 
admitted that neither he had shown any property owned by the deceased in 
which he was present when the occurrence took place in the rough site plan 
(Exh.PL) of the place of occurrence as prepared by him nor any such land 
owned by the deceased was shown to him by the prosecution witnesses 
namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem (PW-2). Muhammad Riaz 
SI (PW-5), the Investigating Officer of the case, during cross-examination, 
admitted as under:- 
“The Banna which was bone of contention in this case was not pointed out 
by me in inspection notes or rough site plan. It is correct that landed 
property of accused party was also not shown by me in rough site plan. 
………………. 
No proof with regard to ownership of any property was produced before me 
by any party” (emphasis supplied)  
In this manner, the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and 
Abdul Kareem (PW-2) failed to prove their stated reason for their arrival at 
the place of occurrence. 
14.      We have also noted that according to the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem (PW-2), the deceased had gone to 
the place of occurrence on a motorcycle and the said motorcycle was present 
at the spot when the Investigating Officer of the case, came to the place of 

Murder Reference No. 35  of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 597 of 2022 
 
 
14 
 
occurrence. The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) during 
cross-examination, stated as under:- 
“The motorcycle belongs (sic) to my father was lying at the spot when 
police came there. Even mobile phone of the deceased was also lying there. 
The police officer at his own accord secured motorcycle and phone cell of 
the deceased from the spot.” 
A similar claim was made by the prosecution witness namely Abdul Kareem 
(PW-2) and stated that the motorcycle of the deceased (P-2) was taken into 
possession by the police from the place of occurrence however, Muhammad 
Riaz SI (PW-5), the Investigating Officer of the case, contradicted both the 
prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem 
(PW-2) and stated that when he arrived at the place of occurrence, the 
motorcycle of the deceased was not present there rather the same was 
subsequently produced before him. Muhammad Riaz SI (PW-5), the 
Investigating Officer of the case, during cross-examination, admitted as 
under:- 
“It is correct that when I inspected the place of occurrence, mobile phone 
and motorcycle of the deceased were not present there, rather the same 
were produced by the complainant on the same date, i.e. day of 
occurrence”(emphasis supplied)  
Then both the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and 
Abdul Kareem (PW-2) also claimed to had arrived at the place of occurrence 
on their  motorcycles . The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ali (PW-
1) during cross-examination, stated as under:- 

Murder Reference No. 35  of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 597 of 2022 
 
 
15 
 
“Pws of this case are my paternal cousins. We approached to the place of 
occurrence while riding on a motorcycle. We did not hand over the said 
motorcycle to the police. The motorcycle where on we PWs were riding 
belongs to me.” (emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Abdul Kareem (PW-2) during cross-
examination, stated as under:- 
“I reached at the spot on motorcycle. The said motorcycle was owned by 
me but I did  not hand over the said motorcycle to the police. When 
police reached at the spot, even at that time, my motorcycle was stationed 
there. Motorcycle owned by complainant was not present there when 
police visited the spot.”(emphasis supplied)  
As mentioned above, Muhammad Riaz SI (PW-5), the Investigating Officer 
of the case, visited the place of occurrence, after the occurrence and remained 
there for a considerable time. During the course of his stay at the place of 
occurrence, Muhammad Riaz SI (PW-5), the Investigating Officer of the case 
did not take into possession the motorcycles allegedly used by the prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem (PW-2)  to 
arrive at the place of occurrence ,alongwith the other recoveries, though there 
was no occasion for the said motorcycles not to have been present at the place 
of occurrence or not being taken into possession by the Investigating Officer 
during his visit at the place of the occurrence, if the same were available. The 
said motorcycles which were allegedly used by the prosecution witnesses 
namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem (PW-2) were not even 
produced during the entire period of investigation nor were produced before 
the learned trial court. , Muhammad Riaz SI (PW-5), the Investigating Officer 

Murder Reference No. 35  of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 597 of 2022 
 
 
16 
 
of the case, even admitted that no such motorcycles were produced before him 
and stated duting cross examination as under :- 
“Except motorbike of the deceased, no other motorbike was produced before 
me.” 
 The non-production of the motorcycles used by the prosecution witnesses 
namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem (PW-2)   to arrive at the 
place of occurrence and the failure of Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul 
Kareem (PW-2)  as well as the Investigating Officer of the case to produce 
the same before the learned trial court leads to only one conclusion and that 
being that no such motorcycles were available. Had motorcycles been used by 
the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1)   and Abdul 
Kareem (PW-2)  to arrive at the place of occurrence, then the same must have 
been available at the place of occurrence, at the time of arrival of Muhammad 
Riaz SI (PW-5) , the Investigating Officer of the case  and the same would 
necessarily have been taken into possession by Muhammad Riaz SI (PW-5) , 
the Investigating Officer of the case  but they were admittedly not and it 
proves that a false claim was made by the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Ali (PW-1)   and Abdul Kareem (PW-2)   that they had arrived at 
the place of occurrence on their motorcycles. In this manner, the prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1)   and Abdul Kareem (PW-2) failed 
miserably to prove that they had indeed arrived at the place of occurrence, at 
the time when the same was happening. Reliance in this regard is placed on 
the case of “Muhammad Ali Vs. The State” (2015 SCMR 137) wherein the 
august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held as under:- 

Murder Reference No. 35  of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 597 of 2022 
 
 
17 
 
“The Investigating Officer during the cross-examination has admitted that 
the 'Dala' was not present when he visited the spot and he had not taken 
into possession the said 'Dala' during investigation. So the story introduced 
by the eye-witnesses that they were travelling on the 'Dala' when the 
incident took place is not supported by any connecting material.” 
We have also noted that Muhammad Naeem Patwari (PW-4)  admitted during 
cross-examination that he had not mentioned the names of the witnesses in 
the scaled site plan of the place of occurrence (Exh. PJ)  . Muhammad Naeem 
Patwari (PW-4)  , during cross-examination admitted as under:- 
“The name of witnesses is not mentioned in site plan.” 
15.     We have also noted that the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad 
Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem (PW-2) claimed that their clothes were 
smeared with the  blood of the deceased ,however at the same time also 
admitted that they did not hand over the said clothes to the Investigating 
Officer of the case .  Muhammad Ali (PW-1), during cross-examination, stated 
as under: - 
“I wearing (sic) clothes were smeared with blood. However, clothes 
of Pws were not having any blood stained. I did not hand over my 
wearing clothes to the police.”(emphasis supplied)  
Abdul Kareem (PW-2), during cross-examination, stated as under: - 
“My wearing clothes were smeared with blood.” 
Muhammad Riaz SI (PW-5), the Investigating Officer of the case, did not take 
any such blood-stained clothes of the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem (PW-2)  in possession during the 

Murder Reference No. 35  of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 597 of 2022

investigation of the case. Muhammad Riaz SI (PW-5) , the Investigating 
Officer of the case, who otherwise showed extraordinary interest in the case, 
did not take the clothes of prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ali 
(PW-1) and Abdul Kareem (PW-2)  which were stained with blood, into 
possession and if these were sent to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, 
Lahore for examination and grouping with that of the blood-stained clothes of 
the deceased, the same would have provided the strongest corroboration to the 
testimony of the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and 
Abdul Kareem (PW-2) . Guidance is sought from the principle enunciated by 
the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Mst. SUGHRA BEGUM 
and another versus QAISER PERVEZ and others (2015 S C M R 1142) and  
in the case of Mst. MIR ZALAI versus GHAZI KHAN and others (2020 S C M 
R 319) and  in the case of NADEEM alias KALA versus The State and others 
(2018 S C M R 153). To compound the doubt with regard to the presence of 
the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem 
(PW-2) at the place of occurrence Muhammad Riaz SI (PW-5) , the 
Investigating Officer of the case, contradicted the prosecution witnesses 
namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem (PW-2) and stated that 
the clothes of the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and 
Abdul Kareem (PW-2) were not even stained with the blood of the deceased. 
Muhammad Riaz SI (PW-5) , the Investigating Officer of the case, during 
cross-examination, stated as under :- . 
“Neither I observed the presence of blood on wearing clothes of 
complainant and Pws nor I secured the same.” 

Murder Reference No. 35  of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 597 of 2022 
 
 
19 
 
The abovementioned statement of  Muhammad Riaz SI (PW-5) , the 
Investigating Officer of the case, lays bare the untruthful and false claim of 
prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem 
(PW-2)  to have been present at the place of occurrence, at the time of 
occurrence and having their clothes stained with the blood of the deceased .  
16.        We have also noted with concern that the prosecution witnesses 
namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem (PW-2) made a failed 
attempt to portray that the prosecution witness namely Abdul Kareem (PW-
2) was already present at the place of occurrence before the occurrence 
however were found to had deposed falsely in this regard and having 
improved their statements. It was brought on record during the cross-
examination of the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and 
Abdul Kareem (PW-2) that it had been mentioned in the oral statement 
(Exh.PA) and  in the statement (Exh.DA)  of Abdul Kareem (PW-2) recorded 
under section 161 Cr.P.C. that the prosecution witness namely Abdul Kareem 
(PW-2) had arrived at the place of occurrence after hearing the sound of firing. 
During cross-examination the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ali 
(PW-1) was confronted with his oral statement (Exh.PA) and the learned trial 
court observed as under:- 
“I did not get record in Ex.P.A that Pws Abdul Karim and Akram rushed 
towards the spot on reports of fire. Confronted with Ex.P.A wherein it is 
so recorded.”(emphasis supplied) 
Similarly the prosecution witness namely Abdul Kareem (PW-2) was 
confronted with his statement (Exh.DA)  recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C. 
during cross-examination and the learned trial court observed as under:- 

Murder Reference No. 35  of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 597 of 2022 
 
 
20 
 
“I did not get record in my statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C before the police that I 
alongwith Akram Pw and complainant attracted to the spot on the report of 
fire. Confronted with Ex.D.A wherein it is so recorded.” 
Even Muhammad Riaz SI (PW-5), the Investigating Officer of the case 
admitted as under :- 
“Eye-witnesses of this occurrence reached at the place of occurrence after 
hearing reports of fire.” (emphasis supplied)  
The above referred portions of the cross-examination of the prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem (PW-2) as well 
as Muhammad Riaz SI (PW-5), Investigating Officer of the case, clearly is 
reflective of the fact that the prosecution witness namely Abdul Kareem (PW-
2) arrived at the place of occurrence only after hearing the noise of the firing 
and was not present there before. 
17. 
Another aspect of the prosecution case revealing of the absence of the 
prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem 
(PW-2) at the place of occurrence, at the time of occurrence, is the 
contradictory statements made by the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem (PW-2) regarding the place and 
time of the death of the deceased. According to the prosecution witness 
namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1), the deceased died at the spot whereas the 
prosecution witness namely Abdul Kareem (PW-2), in his examination in 
chief, stated that the deceased died after arriving at the hospital. The 
prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1), in his statement before 
the learned trial court stated as under:- 

Murder Reference No. 35  of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 597 of 2022 
 
 
21 
 
“My father succumbed to injuries at the spot.” 
Abdul Kareem (PW-2), in his examination in chief, stated as under:- 
“Then we attended the deceased in injured and took him to hospital, 
where he succumbed to the injuries.” (emphasis supplied) 
Moreover, during cross-examination, the prosecution witness namely Abdul 
Kareem (PW-2) changed his version with regard to the death of the deceased 
at the hospital and went on to claim that the deceased had died at the spot and 
his dead body was available at the spot even when the police arrived there. 
The prosecution witness namely Abdul Kareem (PW-2) during cross-
examination, stated as under:- 
“Police arrived at the spot for the first time at 10.30 a.m. Dead body of 
deceased was lying at the spot when police firstly reached at the spot. 
No police official accompanied the dead body. Police instead of 
accompanying the dead body remained present at the spot.” (emphasis 
supplied) 
The prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul 
Kareem (PW-2) also made contradictory statements with regard to the 
circumstances as to how the dead body arrived at the hospital. The prosecution 
witness namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) claimed that he went to the hospital 
with the dead body of the deceased and there got recorded his oral statement 
(Exh.PA) whereas, as mentioned above, the prosecution witness namely 
Abdul Kareem (PW-2), initially claimed that the deceased was taken to the 
hospital in an injured condition, however, subsequently stated that the dead 
body was at the place of occurrence even at the time of arrival of the police. 
Moreover, the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) admitted 

Murder Reference No. 35  of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 597 of 2022 
 
 
22 
 
during cross-examination that he did not mention in his statements to the 
police that how the dead body of the deceased was taken to the hospital or 
whether he had any documentary evidence in proof of the claim that it was 
him who had taken the dead body to the hospital. The prosecution witness 
namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1), admitted during cross-examination as 
under:- 
“I produced the proof of bringing dead body in hospital to the IO during 
investigation of this case. Again said I did not produce any proof to 
brining the dead body of deceased to hospital from the spot. 1 even did not 
disclose the mode of shifting the dead body in hospital. It is correct that 
whenever any patient or deceased is brought to any hospital, a receipt/token 
is always issued by the hospital. I did not receive any such receipt from the 
hospital.” (emphasis supplied)  
Furthermore, the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) claimed 
that the police had followed the dead body to the hospital and during cross-
examination, stated as under:- 
“Police reached at the spot at 10.12 a.m. and remained there. I alongwith 
Pws shifted the dead body to hospital. One police vehicle of police post 
Feroza reached at the spot firstly. Official of police post Feroza also 
accompanied the dead body to hospital while following the Ambulance on 
official vehicle. Volunteered SHO P.S.Pacca Laran also reached in hospital. 
Police officials also helped us in lifting the dead body from the spot.” 
Whereas, as mentioned above, the prosecution witness namely Abdul Kareem 
(PW-2) contradicted Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and stated that no police official 
had accompanied the dead body to the hospital. Muhammad Riaz SI (PW-5), 
also admitted that he did not secure any documentary record to establish as to 

Murder Reference No. 35  of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 597 of 2022 
 
 
23 
 
how and by whom the dead body was brought to the hospital and admitted 
during cross-examination as under:- 
“I did not secure any record from RHC, Feroza to verify about the person 
who brought the dead body there. The vehicle which used for transportation 
of dead body was never produced before me.” 
The contradictory and mutually destructive claims of the prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem (PW-2) 
regarding how the dead body of the deceased was shifted to the hospital from 
the place of occurrence are indicative of the fact  that the prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem (PW-2) did not 
know how and by whom Jam Siraj Ahmad (deceased) was shifted to the 
hospital as  he would have been shifted from the place of occurrence to the 
hospital only if he was injured and alive at the place of occurrence and not 
when he had already died at the spot and his death was also in the knowledge 
of the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul 
Kareem (PW-2). The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) 
admitted during cross-examination as under:- 
“I became sure at the spot that my father had died.” 
18.     We have noted with grave concern that not only the prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem (PW-2) did not 
state with any consistency regarding the taking of the dead body of the 
deceased to the hospital but also it is the fact of the prosecution case itself that 
the oral statement (Exh.PA) of Muhammad Ali (PW-1) was recorded by 
Muhammad Riaz SI (PW-5) at the hospital at 01.20 p.m. on 11.12.2020, the 

Murder Reference No. 35  of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 597 of 2022 
 
 
24 
 
formal F.I.R (Exh.PA/3) was registered on 11.12.2020 at 02.05 p.m. by 
Muhammad Jameel ASI (PW-8), however, the post mortem examination of 
the dead body was conducted on 11.12.2020 at 12.40 p.m., much before the 
lodging of the F.I.R. .Dr.Shahwaiz (PW-10), in his statement before the 
learned trial court, stated as under:- 
“According to police papers, the date & time of death was 11.12.2020 at 
10.00 a.m. and dead body was received in dead house on the same day at 
12.40 p.m. I received the complete documents of police on the same day at 
12.30 p.m. I conducted autopsy on the same date, i.e. 11.12.2020 at 12.40 
p.m.” (emphasis supplied)  
In this manner, the dead body had been brought to the hospital and the post 
mortem examination of the dead body had already been conducted even prior 
to the recording of the oral statement (Exh.PA) of Muhammad Ali (PW-1) by 
Muhammad Riaz SI (PW-5). It establishes the fact that  the deceased was 
brought to the hospital by someone else and not  by the prosecution witnesses 
namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem (PW-2) as claimed by 
them, albeit unsuccessfully. In this manner we have arrived at an irresistible 
conclusion that both prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) 
and Abdul Kareem (PW-2) were not present at the place of occurrence and 
did not even know how the dead body had arrived at the hospital much before 
the recording of the oral statement (Exh.PA) of Muhammad Ali (PW-1). The 
contradictions in the statements of the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem (PW-2) with regard to various 
facets of the prosecution case are obvious. Despite our repeated queries, the 
learned Deputy Prosecutor General as well as the learned counsels for the 

Murder Reference No. 35  of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 597 of 2022 
 
 
25 
 
complainant remained unable to explain these obvious contradictions. The 
failure of the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1)  and 
Abdul Kareem (PW-2) to make consistent statements has repercussions, 
proving that the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1)   and 
Abdul Kareem (PW-2) were not present at the place of occurrence, at the time 
of the occurrence and had not witnessed the same. 
19. 
Another worrying aspect of the prosecution case is that both the 
prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem 
(PW-2) candidly admitted that when the police had first arrived at the place 
of occurrence, they did not make any statement to the police officials 
regarding the occurrence and when the police was present at the hospital even 
then, the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul 
Kareem (PW-2) did not make any statement regarding the occurrence and it 
was only subsequently that the statements of the prosecution witnesses 
namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem (PW-2) regarding the 
occurrence were recorded. The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ali 
(PW-1), during cross-examination, admitted as under:- 
“At 10.12 a.m. when police firstly met us at the spot, even at that time, my 
father had already died. When police firstly visited the spot, neither I nor 
any of my Pw made any statement.” (emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Abdul Kareem (PW-2), during cross-
examination, admitted as under:- 
“In our first meeting with the police at the spot, none of us made any 
statement to the police. 

Murder Reference No. 35  of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 597 of 2022 
 
 
26 
 
……………… 
Police completed its investigation at the spot till 12.00/1.00 noon at the 
place of occurrence. Throughout the proceedings of police at the spot, I 
remained present there. After completion of entire investigation at the place 
of occurrence, I visited RHC, Feroza on our own vehicle. I visited RHC 
Feroza for the first time on the day of occurrence at 12.00/1.00 noon. 
Postmortem examination of the deceased had not yet conducted when I 
reached there. My no statement was recorded by the police till my 
reaching hospital. The complainant of this case was not present at the spot 
during the police proceedings. Even the complainant was not present at the 
place of occurrence, when police firstly visited the crime scene. 
Complainant met the police in RHC, Feroza for the first time. Even my 
statement was not recorded in hospital by the police. I made statement 
before the police first time at police station. 
………….. 
When I visited the police station for the first time on the day of occurrence, 
complainant also met us. We remained present at the police station for about 
one hour on the day of occurrence. Complainant got lodged F.I.R at police 
station in my presence.” (emphasis supplied) 
Moreover, both the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) 
and Abdul Kareem (PW-2) also admitted candidly that their statements were 
recorded after the post mortem examination of the dead body of the deceased 
had already been conducted. The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ali 
(PW-1) admitted during cross-examination as under:- 
“Even when we became sure about the death of my deceased father in 
RHC, Feroza, I did not try to report the matter to police by visiting any 

Murder Reference No. 35  of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 597 of 2022 
 
 
27 
 
police station. After the completion of postmortem examination of 
deceased, we visited the police station and got lodged FIR of this 
case. I alongwith Pws of F.I.R together visited Police Station Pacca 
Laran for lodging F.I.R. We had already received the dead body after 
autopsy when we proceeded for police station. Again said my brother 
Jam Imran after receiving dead body shifted it to our house and then 
we proceeded towards Police Station Pacca Laran for registration of  
F.I.R. At police station, my statement as well as statements of Jam 
Abdul Karim and Jam Muhammad Akram Pws were recorded.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
The prosecution witness namely Abdul Kareem (PW-2), during cross-
examination, admitted as under:- 
“Dead body had already been shifted to home after postmortem 
examination when F.I.R of this case was lodged.” 
The prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul 
Kareem (PW-2) themselves admitted that the oral statement  (Exh. P.A.) of  
Muhammad Ali (PW-1)  and the formal F.I.R (Exh.PA/3) were prepared after 
probe, consultation, planning, investigation and discussion. The scrutiny of 
the statements of the prosecution witnesses reveals that the oral statement 
(Exh. P.A.) of Muhammad Ali (PW-1) was neither prompt nor spontaneous 
nor natural, rather was a contrived, manufactured and a compromised 
document. No corroboration of the prosecution evidence can be had from the 
said oral statement (Exh.PA) of Muhammad Ali (PW-1). Sufficient doubts 
have arisen and inference against the prosecution has to be drawn in this 
regard.

20. 
 The learned Deputy Prosecutor General and the learned counsels for 
the complainant, have submitted that the recoveries of the Motorcycle (P-10) 
and the pistol (P-9)  offered sufficient corroboration of the statements of the 
eye-witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem (PW-2). 
Regarding the recoveries of the Motorcycle (P-10)  on 16.06.2021  and the 
pistol (P-9) on 20.06.2021  from the appellant namely Irshad Saeed, the same 
cannot be relied upon as the Investigating Officer of the case, did not join any 
witness of the locality during the recoveries of the said Motorcycle (P-10) and 
the pistol (P-9)  from the appellant which was in clear violation of section 103 
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. The prosecution witness namely Abdul 
Kareem (PW-2) , admitted during cross-examination , as under:- 
“None from the vicinity of recovery associated the recovery proceedings.” 
(emphasis supplied). 
The prosecution witness namely Ishfaq Ahmad 918/C (PW-7), also 
admitted during cross-examination as under:- 
“Place of recovery was not locked. However, doors were bolted which were 
got opened by the accused Irshad Saeed by knocking. 2/3 private persons 
were present at the place of recovery. However, they were not associated 
into recovery proceedings.” 
Muhammad Shahbaz SI (PW-9), the Investigating Officer of the case also 
admitted during cross-examination as under:- 
“Private prosecution witnesses were accompanying me at the time of 
recovery of motorcycle. Neither the said private witnesses endorsed the 
recovery memo nor their statements were recorded by me. 

Murder Reference No. 35  of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 597 of 2022 
 
 
29 
 
…………….. 
On 20.06.2021 I again effected recovery of pistol from accused Irshad Saeed 
from the said house. Since no independent witness from the locality was 
ready to record his statement so I did not associate any independent witness 
in recovery proceedings on that day. However, I have not mentioned this fact 
black & white in any case diary.” 
The provisions of section 103 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, 
unfortunately, are honoured more in disuse than compliance. To appreciate 
it better, this section is being reproduced:- 
"103.--(1) Before making a search under this chapter, the officer or 
other person about to make it shall call upon two or more 
respectable inhabitants of the locality in which the place to be 
searched is situate to attend and witness the search and may 
issue an order in writing to them or any of them so to do.” 
 
Therefore, the evidence of the recoveries of the Motorcycle (P-10)  on 
16.06.2021  and the pistol (P-9) on 20.06.2021 from the appellant cannot be 
used as incriminating evidence against the appellant, being evidence that was 
obtained through illegal means and hence hit by the exclusionary rule of 
evidence. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Muhammad 
Ismail and others Vs. The State ( 2017 SCMR 898) at page 901 has held as 
under:- 
“For the above mentioned recovery of weapons the prosecution had failed 
to associate any independent witness of the locality and, thus, the 
mandatory provisions of section 103, Cr.P.C. had flagrantly been violated 
in that regard.”  
 
Moreover, as mentioned above, the pistol (P-9) was recovered on 20.06.2021 
from the same house from where the Motorcycle (P-10)  had been recovered 
on 16.06.2021. Muhammad Shahbaz SI (PW-9), the Investigating Officer 

Murder Reference No. 35  of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 597 of 2022 
 
 
30 
 
of the case had already visited the said house on 12.06.2021 with regard to 
getting the motorcycle (P-10) recovered and had conducted a search of the 
said house on the said date, however, did not observe the presence of the 
pistol (P-9) on the said date rather went on to claim that the appellant got 
recovered the pistol (P-9) from the same house on 20.06.2021. This also 
lays bare the attempt of Muhammad Shahbaz SI (PW-9), the Investigating 
Officer of the case to pad up the prosecution case with false evidence. 
Furthermore, according to the report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, 
Lahore, the empty shells of the bullets recovered from the place of 
occurrence were of .9mm whereas, the pistol (P-9) was of 30-bore, hence, 
no comparison was made to determine as to whether the empty shells of the 
bullets recovered from the place of occurrence had been fired in the pistol 
(P-9). Therefore, the recoveries of the Motorcycle (P-10)  on 16.06.2021  and 
the pistol (P-9) on 20.06.2021  from the appellant do not further the case of 
the prosecution in any manner. In view of the above-mentioned facts, the 
alleged recoveries of the Motorcycle (P-10)  on 16.06.2021  and the pistol (P-
9) on 20.06.2021  are not proved and the same cannot be used as a 
circumstance against the appellant. Even otherwise, as we have disbelieved 
the ocular account in this case, hence, the evidence of recoveries of the 
Motorcycle (P-10)  on 16.06.2021  and the pistol (P-9) on 20.06.2021 would 
have no consequence. It is an admitted rule of appreciation of evidence that 
recovery is only a corroborative piece of evidence and if the ocular account is 
found to be unreliable, then the recovery has no evidentiary value. 
21. 
 The learned Deputy Prosecutor General and the learned counsels for 
the complainant have also relied upon the evidence of motive and submitted 

Murder Reference No. 35  of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 597 of 2022 
 
 
31 
 
that it corroborated the ocular account. According to the prosecution witnesses 
namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and Abdul Kareem (PW-2), the motive of the 
occurrence was that the appellant had sold land belonging to the complainant 
of the case to one Haji Rafaqat and when the appellant was confronted with 
this fact, the appellant murdered the deceased. We have perused the 
statements of the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and 
Abdul Kareem (PW-2) and find that they failed to prove the motive of the 
occurrence as stated by them. Haji Rafaqat,  the person to whom the land 
belonging to the deceased had been sold by the appellant, neither joined the 
investigation of the case nor appeared before the learned trial court in support 
of the claim of the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and 
Abdul Kareem (PW-2). The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ali 
(PW-1), admitted during cross-examination as under:- 
“One Haji Rafaqat never joined investigation of this case. I even did not 
produce any proof of sale of land by accused persons to one Haji Rafaqat.”. 
Furthermore, the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1) and 
Abdul Kareem (PW-2) also admitted that they did not produce any 
documentary evidence in support of the motive of the occurrence as alleged 
by them and went on to admit that in fact, they had no evidence available with 
them with regard to the motive of the occurrence. The prosecution witness 
namely Muhammad Ali (PW-1), admitted during cross-examination as 
under:- 
“I even did not produce any proof of sale of land by accused persons to one 
Haji Rafaqat. No suit regarding partition of land was ever filed in any court 
either from our side or from accused side. Even no injunctive order was 

Murder Reference No. 35  of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 597 of 2022 
 
 
32 
 
passed in favour of any of party. No application for demarcation was moved 
by any party before this occurrence. I did not produce any sort of evidence 
regarding the dispute of land between me and accused persons 
throughout the investigation of this case..”(emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Abdul Kareem (PW-2), admitted during 
cross-examination as under:- 
“I did not get record in Ex.D.A that Irshad Saeed accused sold out 20 
feet land of deceased. I got recorded in Ex.D.A that regarding the exchange 
of hot words between the deceased and accused Irshad Saeed. Confronted 
with Ex.D.A wherein it is not so recorded 
………….. 
I did not produce any proof of any dispute between the accused and 
deceased during investigation. I even did not produce any proof of 
ownership of disputed land to the police.”(emphasis supplied)  
Muhammad Shahbaz SI (PW-9), the Investigating Officer of the case also 
admitted during cross-examination that he did not collect any evidence in 
support of the motive of the occurrence. During cross-examination, 
Muhammad Shahbaz SI (PW-9), the Investigating Officer of the case, stated 
as under:- 
“Neither the complainant and Pws produced any evidence of motive part of 
this occurrence nor I gave my findings in this regard.” 
There is no evidence on record that Siraj Ahmed son of Rasool Bakhsh  
(deceased) was facing any threat to his life at the hands of the appellant prior 
to the occurrence. The prosecution witnesses failed to provide evidence 
enabling us to determine the truthfulness of the motive alleged and the fact 

Murder Reference No. 35  of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 597 of 2022 
 
 
33 
 
that the said motive was so compelling that it could have led the appellant to 
have committed the Qatl-i-Amd of the deceased. There is a poignant hush with 
regard to the particulars of the motive alleged. No independent witness was 
produced by the prosecution to prove the motive as alleged. Even otherwise a 
tainted piece of evidence cannot corroborate another tainted piece of evidence. 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in the case of Muhammad 
Javed v. The State (2016 SCMR 2021) as under: 
“The said related and chance witnesses had failed to receive any 
independent corroboration inasmuch as no independent proof of the motive 
set up by the prosecution had been brought on the record of the case.” 
 
22. 
The learned Deputy Prosecutor General and the learned counsels for 
the complainant have also laid much premium on the abscondence of the 
appellant  namely Irshad Saeed as proof of his guilt. The fact of abscondence 
of an accused can be used as a corroborative piece of evidence, which cannot 
be read in isolation but it has to be read along with the substantive piece of 
evidence. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in the case of 
Asadullah v. Muhammad Ali (PLD 1971 SC 541) that both corroborative and 
ocular evidence are to be read together and not in isolation. As regards 
abscondence, the august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in the case of  
Rasool Muhammad v. Asal Muhammad (1995 SCMR 1373) that abscondence 
is only a suspicious circumstance. In the case of Muhammad Sadiq v. Najeeb 
Ali (1995 SCMR 1632) the august Supreme Court of Pakistan observed that 
abscondence itself has no value in the absence of any other evidence. It was 
also held in the case of Muhammad Khan v. State (1999 SCMR 1220) that 
abscondence of the accused can never remedy the defects in the prosecution

case. In the case of Gul Khan v. State (1999 SCMR 304) it was observed by 
the august Supreme Court of Pakistan that  abscondence per se is not sufficient 
to prove the guilt but can be taken as a corroborative piece of evidence. In the 
cases of Muhammad Arshad v. Qasim Ali (1992 SCMR 814), PirBadshah v. 
State (1985 SCMR 2070) and Amir Gul v. State (1981 SCMR 182) it was 
observed that conviction on abscondence alone cannot be sustained. In the 
present case, substantive piece of evidence in the shape of ocular account has 
been disbelieved, therefore, no conviction can be based on abscondence alone. 
Reliance is also placed on the cases of “Muhammad Farooq and another Vs. 
The State” (2006 SCMR 1707) and “Nizam Khan and 2 others Vs. the State” 
(1984 SCMR 1092) and Rohtas Khan vs. The State (2010 SCMR 566). 
 
23. 
The only other piece of evidence left to be considered by us is the 
medical evidence with regard to the injuries observed on the dead body of the 
deceased by Dr.Shahwaiz (PW-10) but the same is of no assistance in this case 
as medical evidence by its nature and character, cannot recognize a culprit in 
case of an unobserved occurrence. As all the other pieces of evidence relied 
upon by the prosecution, in this case, have been disbelieved and discarded by 
us, therefore, the appellant’s conviction cannot be upheld on the basis of 
medical evidence alone. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in its binding 
judgment titled “Hashim Qasim and another Vs. The State” (2017 SCMR 
986) has enunciated the following principle of law:  
“The medical evidence is only confirmatory or of supporting nature and is 
never held to be corroboratory evidence, to identify the culprit.”

The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in its binding judgment titled “Naveed 
Asghar and two others Vs. The State” (P L D 2021 Supreme Court 600) has 
enunciated the following principle of law:  
“31. 
The prosecution has attempted to complete the chain of 
circumstantial evidence by medical evidence relating to the post mortem 
examinations of the deceased persons. This evidence proves only the 
factum that death of the deceased persons was caused by cutting their 
throats through some sharp edge weapon; it does in no way indicate who 
had cut their throats and with what particular weapon. Medical evidence 
is in the nature of supporting, confirmatory or explanatory of the direct 
or circumstantial evidence, and is not “corroborative evidence” in the 
sense the term is used in legal parlance for a piece of evidence that itself 
also has some probative force to connect the accused person with the 
commission of offence. Medical evidence by itself does not throw any 
light on the identity of the offender. Such evidence may confirm the 
available substantive evidence with regard to certain facts including seat 
of the injury, nature of the injury, cause of the death, kind of the weapon 
used in the occurrence, duration between the injuries and the death, and 
presence of an injured witness or the injured accused at the place of 
occurrence, but it does not connect the accused with the commission of 
the offence. It cannot constitute corroboration for proving involvement 
of the accused person in the commission of offence, as it does not 
establish the identity of the accused person.32 Therefore, the medical 
evidence is of little help to the prosecution for bringing home the guilt to 
the petitioners.” 
 
24. 
Considering all the above circumstances, we entertain serious doubt in 
our minds regarding the involvement of the appellant namely Irshad Saeed 
son of Saeed Ahmed  , in the present case. It is a settled principle of law that 
for giving the benefit of the doubt it is not necessary that there should be so 
many circumstances rather if only a single circumstance creating reasonable 
doubt in the mind of a prudent person is available then such benefit is to be 
extended to an accused not as a matter of concession but as of right. The 
august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Muhammad Mansha Vs. The 
State” (2018 SCMR 772) has enunciated the following principle: 

Murder Reference No. 35  of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 597 of 2022 
 
 
36 
 
“Needless to mention that while giving the benefit of doubt to an accused 
it is not necessary that there should be many circumstances creating doubt. 
If there is a circumstance which creates reasonable doubt in a prudent 
mind about the guilt of the accused, then the accused would be entitled to 
the benefit of such doubt, not as a matter of grace and concession, but as 
a matter of right. It is based on the maxim, “it is better that ten guilty 
persons be acquitted rather than one innocent person be convicted”. 
Reliance in this behalf can be made upon the cases of Tariq Pervez v. The 
State (1995 SCMR 1345), Ghulam Qadir and 2 others v. The State (2008 
SCMR 1221), Muhammad Akramv.The State (2009 SCMR 230) and 
Muhammad Zamanv.The State (2014 SCMR 749).” 
 
Reliance is also placed on the judgment of the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan Najaf Ali Shah Vs. the State (2021 S C M R 736) in which it has 
been observed as infra :- 
“9. Mere heinousness of the offence if not proved to the hilt is not a 
ground to avail the majesty of the court to do complete justice. This is 
an established principle of law and equity that it is better that 100 guilty 
persons should let off but one innocent person should not suffer. As the 
preeminent English jurist William Blackstone wrote, “Better that ten 
guilty persons escape, than that one innocent suffer.” Benjamin 
Franklin, who was one of the leading figures of early American history, 
went further arguing “it is better a hundred guilty persons should 
escape than one innocent person should suffer.” All the contradictions 
noted by the learned High Court are sufficient to cast a shadow of doubt 
on the prosecution’s case, which entitles the petitioner to the right of 
benefit of the doubt. It is a well settled principle of law that for the 
accused to be afforded this right of the benefit of the doubt it is not 
necessary that there should be many circumstances creating uncertainty 
and if there is only one doubt, the benefit of the same must got to the 
petitioner. This Court in the case of Mst. Asia Bibi v. The State (PLD 
2019 SC 64) while relying on the earlier judgments of this Court has 
categorically held that “if a single circumstance creates reasonable 
doubt in a prudent mind about the apprehension of guilt of an accused, 
then he/she shall be entitled to such benefit not as a matter of grace and 
concession, but as of right. Reference in this regard may be made to the 
cases of Tariq Pervaiz v. The State (1998 SCMR 1345) and Ayub Masih 
v. The State (PLD 2002 SC 1048).” The same view was reiterated in 
Abdul Jabbar v. State (2010 SCMR 129) when this court observed that 
once a single loophole is observed in a case presented by the 
prosecution, such as conflict in the ocular account and medical 
evidence or presence of eye-witnesses being doubtful, the benefit of such 
loophole/lacuna in the prosecution’s case automatically goes in favour 
of an accused.” 
25.  
 For what has been discussed above, Criminal Appeal No.597 of 2022 
lodged by Irshad Saeed son of Saeed Ahmed   (appellant) is allowed and the 
conviction and sentence of the appellant awarded by the learned trial court
