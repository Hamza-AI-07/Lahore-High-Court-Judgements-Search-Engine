JUDGMENT 
 
 
Date of hearing 
24.11.2022 
For the Petitioner: 
Mr. Junaid Jabbar Khan, Advocate. 
For the Respondents: 
Mian Azhar Saleem, Advocate, with Hamza 
Khalid Randhawa, Legal Head of The Bank of 
Punjab. 
 
 
Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – The Petitioner joined The Bank 
of Punjab (the “Bank”) as a contractual employee in December 2005. 
After two years, he was regularized and absorbed in Officer Grade-III. In 
due course of time, he was promoted to Officer Grade-I and, in December 
2013, posted as Manager Operations at the Bank’s DHA Branch, Lahore. 
He worked there until 06.03.2015 when he was transferred to the Ali 
View Garden Branch. On 11.08.2015, his successor Manager at the DHA 
Branch reported several fraudulent transactions to the management who 
initiated an inquiry. On 17.09.2015, the Competent Authority issued 
Show Cause Notice to the Petitioner for misconduct. He submitted his 
response which the Competent Authority found unsatisfactory and 
nominated the Head of FMU as the Inquiry Officer. On 29.10.2015, it 
gave the Petitioner Final Show Cause Notice and, on 09.12.2015, 
dismissed him from service. The Petitioner appealed to the Bank’s 
Chairman but he rejected it by his decision dated 25.11.2016. He filed 
W.P. No.3389/2017 thereagainst before this Court which was heard on 
19.10.2018, and on his counsel’s request, the learned Single Judge 
remitted the matter to the Bank for re-consideration. The Petitioner failed 
to get relief even in the remand proceedings, and the order dated 

Writ Petition No. 10403/2019 
 
- 2 - 
22.11.2018 maintained his penalty of dismissal from service. By this 
petition, filed under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”), the Petitioner seeks the 
quashing of orders dated 25.11.2016 and 22.11.2018 (the “Impugned 
Orders”) and his reinstatement in service with back benefits. 
The submissions 
2. 
 
The Petitioner’s counsel, Mr. Junaid Jabbar Khan, Advocate, 
contends that M. Ahmad Mohyuddin Mekhary, Officer Grade-I, 
committed fraud with the Bank and made phony transactions for personal 
gains. He stole the Petitioner’s password and used his digital signature to 
authenticate them. Mr. Khan maintains that the Petitioner was not a party 
to the scam and did not derive any benefit from it. According to him, 
Mekhary confirmed to the authorities in his written confessional statement 
that the Petitioner was not associated with him. Later, he refunded the 
entire misappropriated amount to the Bank. Mr. Khan further contends 
that the Petitioner’s right to be treated in accordance with the law, 
guaranteed by Article 4 of the Constitution, has been violated. The Bank 
did not afford him adequate opportunity to defend himself. If it intended 
to pursue legal action against him, it should have followed the procedure 
prescribed by the Punjab Employees, Efficiency, Discipline & 
Accountability Act, 2006 (“PEEDA”). Since it has not done so, the entire 
proceedings against him, including the Impugned Orders, are liable to be 
quashed. Finally, the counsel argues that, in the circumstances of the case, 
the major penalty of dismissal imposed on the Petitioner is harsh and 
disproportionate to the charge. 
3. 
 
The Respondents’ counsel, Mian Azhar Saleem, Advocate, 
has vehemently opposed this petition. He contends that it is not 
maintainable because the principle of master and servant applies to the 
parties’ relationship. He argues that the Petitioner’s employment was 
governed by the service rules contained in the Bank’s HR Manual which 
are non-statutory. It is well established that a person/employee cannot file 
a constitutional petition before the High Court to raise a service grievance 
if his employment is not subject to statutory rules. On merits, the counsel 
submits that the Bank proceeded against the Petitioner under its HR 

Writ Petition No. 10403/2019 
 
- 3 - 
Manual and punished him after due process. He denies the allegation that 
it did not provide him a fair opportunity to defend himself. He also 
controverts the contention that the Bank was supposed to follow PEEDA 
while proceeding against him. 
Opinion 
4. 
 
The Respondents have objected to the maintainability of this 
petition. Therefore, I must decide this issue first. 
5. 
 
An aggrieved party can invoke the High Court’s jurisdiction 
under Article 199(1)(a) of the Constitution against a person performing, 
within its territorial jurisdiction, functions in connection with the affairs 
of the federation or a province or local authority. Article 199(5) elucidates 
that “person” includes any body politic or body corporate, any authority 
under the control of the Federal Government or a Provincial Government, 
and any court or tribunal, other than the Supreme Court, a High Court, or 
a court or tribunal established under a law relating to the armed forces of 
Pakistan. To determine whether an organization is a “person” within the 
meaning of Article 199, the courts generally apply the “function test.”1  
6. 
 
The law is well settled that the employees of only those 
organizations discharging functions in connection with the affairs of the 
federation, a province, or a local authority can invoke the constitutional 
jurisdiction of the High Court in service matters whose employment is 
governed by statutory rules.2 In other words, where the conditions of 
service of an employee of a statutory body are governed by regulations, 
instructions, or directions issued by that body for its internal use rather 
than statutory rules, he cannot file a writ petition to challenge a violation. 
In such a circumstance, the principle of master and servant applies, and an 
employee’s remedy for wrongful termination is a claim for damages.

2 In Muhammad Mubeen-us-Salam and others v. Federation of Pakistan and others 
(PLD 2006 SC 602), the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan held that the persons working in 
government-controlled corporations would not be deemed to have a warrant to a statutory remedy in the 
absence of a warrant of law, i.e. a statute that regulates his terms and conditions of service. 

Writ Petition No. 10403/2019

A constitutional petition is not competent. If, on the other hand, statutory 
rules govern an employee’s service conditions, any action taken against 
him in contravention of the statute or those rules is subject to judicial 
review by the High Court, which may overturn it. The Respondents’ 
objection to the maintainability of the instant petition is premised on the 
ground that the Bank’s HR Manual, which governs the Petitioner’s terms 
of service/employment, is non-statutory. 
7. 
 
But what are the “statutory rules”? The Hon’ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan explicated this concept in Pakistan Red Crescent 
Society and another v. Syed Nazir Gillani (PLD 2005 SC 806). It stated 
that in a corporation constituted by or under the law, the government 
might not reserve the power to regulate the terms of service of the 
employees. Instead, it may leave them to the corporation’s discretion and 
empower it to develop rules or regulations without its intervention. In 
such a situation, the corporation would be the sole judge in prescribing the 
terms of service, and the principle of master and servant would apply. 
However, where a statute or statutory rules regulate the terms and 
conditions of employment, the corporation’s authority is constrained by 
those provisions. It cannot invoke the principle of master and servant 
when an employee challenges his termination and seeks reinstatement. 
The determining factor in evaluating whether a corporation’s rules or 
regulations have statutory force is not their form or name but the source 
under which they are framed. In Chairman, State Life Insurance 
Corporation, and others v. Hamayun Irfan and others (2010 SCMR 
1495), the apex Court held that the source of statutory rules, in general, is 
legislative rather than executive. A rule-making authority enacts them in 
the exercise of statutory power with the approval of the federal or 
provincial government. In actuality, it is the exercise of delegated 
legislative power by the rule-making authority. Ordinarily, it is also 
necessary that certain formalities, like publication in the government 
gazette, should follow the making and promulgation of such rules. In 
Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited and others v. Said Rehman and others 
(2013 SCMR 642), the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that the statutory 
rules have the following three characteristics: 

Writ Petition No. 10403/2019 
 
- 5 - 
(i) 
Rules or regulations are framed by a statutory or public 
body;  
(ii) 
They are framed under the authority or powers conferred in 
the statute; 
(iii) 
They have statutory governmental approval or statutory 
sanction. 
8. 
 
A further reference may be made to Pakistan Defence 
Officers Housing Authority v. Mrs. Itrat Sajjad Khan and others 
(2017 SCMR 2010) in which the Hon’ble Supreme Court held: 
“The test to gauge as to whether the service rules are statutory or not 
was laid down by this Court as far back as in the year 1984 in the case 
of the Principal Cadet College, Kohat, and another v. Mohammad 
Shoab Qureshi (PLD 1984 SC 170) by holding that unless rules of 
service of a statutory body are made or approved by the Government, 
such rules could not be regarded as statutory but mere instructions for 
guidance. However, in the case of Shafique Ahmed Khan v. NESCOM 
through Chairman, Islamabad (PLD 2016 SC 377) as well as in the 
case of Muhammad Zaman and others v. Government of Pakistan 
(2017 SCMR 571), this Court, while widening the scope of such 
criterion held that ‘the test of whether rules/regulations are statutory or 
otherwise is not solely whether their framing requires approval of the 
Federal Government or not, rather it is the nature and area of efficacy 
which determine their status. Rules dealing with instructions for 
internal control or management are treated as non-statutory while those 
whose area of efficacy is broader and/or complementary to the parent 
statute in the matter of crucial importance are statutory.’ ” 
9. 
 
It would not be out of place to mention here that rules do not 
become statutory merely because a corporation has adopted any rules 
framed by the Government or has made them applicable by reference. 
Reliance is placed upon M.H. Mirza v. Federation of Pakistan and 
others (1994 SCMR 1024) and Pakistan Electric Power Company v. 
Syed Salahuddin and others (2022 SCMR 991). 
10. 
 
The Bank is established under The Bank of Punjab Act, 1989 
(the “BoP Act”). Section 3 of the Act states that it is a corporate body. 
Section 25 empowers its Board of Directors to make bye-laws for giving 
effect to the provisions of the Act. Originally, the Board was required to 
frame the bye-laws with the prior approval of the Provincial Government, 
but The Bank of Punjab Ordinance LVII of 2002 dispensed with that 
requirement. 
11. 
 
Before the promulgation of Ordinance LVII of 2002, in the 
exercise of the aforesaid power, the Bank’s Board of Directors framed the 
bye-laws with the approval of the Provincial Government. However, they 

Writ Petition No. 10403/2019 
 
- 6 - 
did not deal with the terms and conditions of the service of the Bank’s 
employees. Bye-law 25 empowered the Board to frame rules regarding 
recruitment and terms and conditions of employment of officers in 
consultation with the Provincial Government. The Board drew rules under 
that provision in consultation with the Finance Department of the 
Government of the Punjab, but they were never placed before the 
Provincial Cabinet for approval. Under Article 129 of the Constitution, 
the Provincial Government consists of the Chief Minister and Provincial 
Ministers.3 In Arshad Ahmad Khan v. Chairman, The Bank of Punjab, 
and others [2000 PLC (C.S.) 1355 : 2001 PLC (C.S.) 207], a Division 
Bench of this Court considered the question as to whether the 
aforementioned service rules/bye-laws could be said to be statutory. It 
held that those service bye-laws were distinct from the bye-laws made 
under section 25 of the BoP Act – which may be described as the “general 
bye-laws” – and one cannot equate them. It determined that the service 
rules/bye-laws do not have the legal standing of statutory rules. The 
relevant excerpt is reproduced below: 
 
“The distinction between these service bye-laws and the bye-laws 
framed under section 25 of The Bank of Punjab Act, 1989 must be kept 
in mind. While the general bye-laws were framed with the approval of 
the Government of Punjab, this approval is lacking in the case of 
service bye-laws. The service bye-laws are to be distinguished from the 
statutory bye-laws in two important respects firstly while bye-laws 
have been framed under section 25 of The Bank of Punjab Act, the 
service bye-laws have been made in exercise of the powers conferred 
by bye-law No.25 of the bye-laws and secondly while the bye-laws 
have the approval of the Provincial Government the approval of 
Provincial Government is lacking in the case of service bye-laws. It, 
therefore, necessarily follows that bye-laws of service does not have the 
force of statutory rules or regulations as in order to achieve that 
character according to section 25 of the Act itself the approval of the 
Provincial Government was necessary which is missing in the present 
case.” 
 
 
The learned Division Bench based its decision on A. George 
v. PIAC (PLD 1971 Lahore 748), which had a fairly similar issue. In that 
case, although the Board of Directors of PIAC had the authority to lay 
down the terms and conditions of employment for its employees, the rules 
issued in that regard required prior approval from the Federal 
Government. The High Court held that the rules could not be considered 
statutory because no such approval existed. The Hon’ble Supreme Court 
                                          
3 Mustafa Impex, Karachi, and others v. Government of Pakistan and others (PLD 2016 SC 808). 

Writ Petition No. 10403/2019

upheld this judgment in Muhammad Yusuf Shah v. PIAC (PLD 1981 SC 
224). 
12. 
 
In Muhammad Ishaq Waheed Butt v. Chairman, The Bank 
of Punjab, and others [2003 PLC (C.S.) 963], the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court approved the dictum laid down in Arshad Ahmed Khan’s case, 
supra. The relevant excerpt is reproduced below: 
“The conclusion as arrived at by the learned High Court revolves 
around the fact that the petitioner’s services were not governed by any 
statutory rules, and accordingly, the writ petition was dismissed as 
being not maintainable. The learned counsel when asked as to whether 
the services of petitioner were governed by any statutory rules, he 
attempted to build up his argument on the basis of ‘minutes of 52nd 
meeting of the Board of Directors’ which by no stretch of imagination 
can be equated to that of ‘Statutory Rules.’ There is no denying the fact 
that the services of petitioner were not governed by any statutory rules 
and the dictum as laid down in Arshad Ahmad v. Chairman, The Bank 
of Punjab Lahore [2000 PLC (C.S.) 1355], Pakistan International 
Airlines Corporation v. Nasir Jamal Malik and others (2001 SCMR 
934), admittedly renders no assistance to the case of petitioner.” 
13. 
 
The counsels for the parties are unable to say whether the 
Bank issued the HR Manual before Ordinance LVII of 2002 amended 
section 25 of the BoP Act or after it. However, that makes little 
difference. His Lordship Ijaz ul Ahsan J. (as he was then) considered the 
status of the Bank’s HR Manual in Amir Shahzad Chaudhary v.  
Chairman, The Bank of Punjab, and others [2015 PLC (C.S.) 423] and 
specifically held that these do not have statutory force. Hence, the Bank’s 
employees are not entitled to invoke the constitutional jurisdiction of this 
Court for their reinstatement in service. In the penultimate paragraph of 
the judgment, his Lordship wrote: 
“The petitioners were employees of the Bank of Punjab and had 
accepted employment on the basis of service contracts and had agreed 
to be governed by the service regulations/HR Manual of the respondent 
bank. Admittedly, the HR Manual does not consist of statutory rules, 
nor does it meet the criteria laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court 
of Pakistan in its judgments discussed above to be termed statutory 
rules. It is an internal document meant to govern the terms and 
conditions of the employees of the respondent bank. Therefore, I am in 
no manner of doubt that the relationship between the petitioners and the 
respondent bank is governed by the principle of “Master and Servant”. 
Any grievance of the petitioners arising out of the alleged violation of 
their service contract/HR Manual is not amenable to interference by 
this Court in the exercise of its constitutional jurisdiction. The 
petitioners are, however, at liberty, if so advised, to approach a court of 
plenary jurisdiction for redressal of their grievance.”

14. 
 
Lately, a learned Single Judge in W.P. No. 39015 of 2016 
and a Division Bench of this Court in ICA No.1645/2015 also held that 
the Bank’s service rules are non-statutory. Hence, a constitutional petition 
by its employees regarding their service matters is not maintainable. 
15. 
 
Mr. Khan relies on Shafique Ahmed Khan and others v. 
NESCOM through Chairman, Islamabad, and others (PLD 2016 SC 
377) in response to the above judgments. He contends that the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court has broadened the criteria for deciding whether 
rules/regulations are statutory in the said case. It has held that the test is 
not simply whether their formulation requires the approval of the 
Government. Rather, the nature and area of efficacy determine their 
standing. The Rules dealing with internal control or management are 
viewed as non-statutory while those whose area of effectiveness is wider 
and which supplement the parent Act in matters of crucial importance are 
considered statutory. I am afraid this argument overlooks the fact that the 
National Command Authority Act, 2010 (the “NCA Act”) is exclusive. 
This statute was enacted inter alia to provide total command and control 
over research, development, production, and use of nuclear and space 
technologies and other related obligations in various fields. The Prime 
Minister of Pakistan heads the Authority, and its members include four 
Ministers, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, and the 
three Services Chiefs. The Hon’ble Supreme Court considered the entire 
scheme of the law and concluded that the Legislature, in its wisdom, 
envisaged a single set of Rules covering all aspects of the Authority as 
mentioned in sections 7, 8, 9, and 15 of the NCA Act. They extended 
beyond the employees and overreached many strategic areas, and there 
was no division or distinction between internal and external management. 
The apex Court further stated that the Authority comprises the Prime 
Minister and the highest-ranking officers of the country, who also have 
the rule-making power. The Rules adopted by the members of the 
Authority did not require anybody else’s approval. Against this backdrop 
the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that although the Rules were not framed 
with the Federal Government’s involvement and approval, they were 
statutory. It is thus evident that the BoP Act and NCA Act have separate 
legislative schemes and objectives. They are not comparable or 

Writ Petition No. 10403/2019 
 
- 9 - 
equivalent. The principle that the Hon’ble Supreme Court has enunciated 
in Shafique Ahmad Khan cannot be applied to the Rules framed under the 
BoP Act. Mr. Khan’s contention is misconceived and is, therefore, 
repelled. 
16. 
 
This is, however, not the end of the matter. The Punjab 
Assembly has enacted the Punjab Employees Efficiency, Discipline and 
Accountability Act, 2006 (PEEDA), to provide measures for improving 
employees’ efficiency, discipline, and accountability in the provincial 
government and corporation service, and ancillary matters.4 According to 
the Act’s section 1(4), it applies to (i) employees in government service, 
(ii) employees in corporation service, and (iii) retired employees of 
government and corporation service (provided that proceedings under the 
Act are initiated against them during their service or within one year of 
their retirement. Section 2(h) defines “employee”. Clause (i) thereof is 
relevant for our present purpose, which is reproduced below: 
(h) “employee” means a person – 
(i) 
in the employment of a corporation, corporate body, 
autonomous body, authority, statutory body or any other 
organization or institution set up, established, owned, managed 
or controlled by the Government, by or under any law for the 
time being in force or a body or organization in which the 
Government has a controlling share or interest and includes the 
chairman and the chief executive and the holder of any other 
office therein; and 
(ii) 
in government service or who is a member of a civil 
service of the province or who holds a civil post in connection 
with the affairs of the province or any employee serving in any 
court or tribunal set up or established by the Government, but 
does not include a Judge of the High Court or any court 
subordinate to the High Court, or any employee of such courts.  
17. 
 
Section 3 of PEEDA sets out the grounds on which 
proceedings may be undertaken against an employee. These include 
inefficiency, misconduct, and corruption. Section 20 gives an overriding 
effect to PEEDA over all other laws.  
18. 
 
Section 7 of the BoP Act stipulates that the Government of 
the Punjab shall be the shareholder of the Bank and may hold up to 80% 
of the shares issued by it. According to the data available on the Bank’s 
website, the Government holds 57.4728% of its shares. Since it has a

controlling stake in the Bank, it is an organization contemplated by 
PEEDA. The Petitioner falls within the definition of “employee” given in 
2(h)(i) of the said Act. 
19. 
 
In Anwar Hussain v. Agricultural Development Bank of 
Pakistan and others (PLD 1984 SC 194), a junior officer in the ADBP 
submitted his resignation which he wanted to withdraw afterward. 
Meanwhile, the ADBP accepted his resignation and notified him about it. 
The officer instituted a suit challenging the acceptance of his resignation. 
ADBP contended that the suit was not maintainable. The Hon’ble 
Supreme Court upheld the objection, holding that section 30 of the 
Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan Ordinance, 1961, empowered 
the ADBP to appoint officers upon terms and conditions as may be 
prescribed by the Regulations framed under section 39 of the said 
Ordinance. Thus, it left the subject of hiring and the terms of employment 
of staff to the ADBP. In the circumstances, the general law of master and 
servant applied. The apex Court further stated that this principle would 
not apply if some enactment or statutory rule intervenes and limits the 
parties’ freedom to negotiate the terms of the contract. The relevant 
excerpt is reproduced below: 
“[I]f the relationship is the result of a contract freely entered into by the 
contracting parties, then the principle of master and servant will apply. 
The principle, however, will not apply if some law or statutory rule 
intervenes and places fetters upon the freedom of the parties in the 
matter of the terms of the contract. It is on this principle that a civil 
servant for whom there are constitutional safeguards, is not governed 
by the principle of master and servant, for he is possessed of a legal 
character for the enforcement of which he can bring an action. Even 
where the employee is not a civil servant, but there are statutory 
safeguards governing his relationship with the employer and placing 
restrictions on the freedom of the parties to act, the general law of 
master and servant will not apply. In such cases, the employer would be 
bound to follow the procedure provided for in the statute or the 
statutory rules before terminating the service of the employee, and in 
the absence of conformity to such procedure, the termination of service 
would not be clothed with validity, and the employee will be entitled to 
an action for his reinstatement.” 
 
 
The Hon’ble Supreme Court reaffirmed the above view in 
Karachi Development Authority and another v. Wali Ahmed Khan and 
others (1991 SCMR 2434), and Raziuddin v. Chairman, Pakistan 
International Airlines Corporation, and others (PLD 1992 SC 531).

In Pakistan Defence Officers Housing Authority and others 
v. Lt.-Col. Syed Jawaid Ahmed (2013 SCMR 1707), some employees of 
Pakistan International Airlines Corporation, House Building Corporation, 
N.E.D. University of Engineering and Technology, and Pakistan State Oil 
Company were proceeded against by their respective departments under 
the Removal from Service (Special Powers) Ordinance, 2000. They were 
awarded punishment on various charges which they challenged in the 
High Court through constitutional petitions. The Hon’ble Supreme Court 
held that although the rules/regulations of these statutory organizations 
were non-statutory, there was a legislative intervention by way of the 
Ordinance of 2000. Hence, the employees had to be dealt with under the 
said law, and the writ petition was competent for default. 
21. 
 
In the present case, the charges against the Petitioner fall 
within the ambit of section 3 of PEEDA. Therefore, the Bank should have 
proceeded against him under that statute. I have already pointed out that it 
supersedes the Bank’s HR Manual because of section 20. In the 
circumstances, in light of the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s dictum in Syed 
Jawaid Ahmed, I hold that this petition is maintainable. 
22. 
 
Let’s now turn to the merits of the case. The Petitioner 
contends that the proceedings against him are void ab inito because they 
were not according to the procedure prescribed by PEEDA. I am inclined 
to agree with him. The following excerpt from Syed Jawaid Ahmed is 
quite instructive: 
“The legislative intent in the promulgation of Ordinance 2000, inter 
alia, was that ‘persons in corporation service’ in their service matters 
should be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the said law 
and to ensure a fair deal/trial it was inter alia provided in the Ordinance 
that unless specifically so exempted by a reasoned order, the competent 
authority shall hold a regular inquiry against an employee accused of 
misconduct and that he shall have a right of appeal (Section 10 of the 
Ordinance).” 
23. 
 
Article 4 of the Constitution states that it is the inalienable 
right of every citizen, wherever he may be, and of every other person for 
the time being within Pakistan to enjoy the protection of the law and to be 
treated in accordance with the law. Chief Justice Muhammad Munir 
writes that Article 4 of the Constitution confers a more basic right than the 
fundamental rights because, unlike the fundamental rights, it cannot be 

Writ Petition No. 10403/2019 
 
- 12 -
suspended.5 The Respondents have violated the Petitioner’s right under 
Article 4 by not following PEEDA. 
24. 
 
In view of the above, this petition is accepted. The 
Impugned Orders are set aside, and the Petitioner is reinstated in service 
forthwith with back benefits. However, the Bank would be at liberty to 
proceed against him de novo under PEEDA.
