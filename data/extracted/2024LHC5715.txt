SULTAN TANVIR AHMAD, J:- This 
appeal, filed under section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure- 
1908 (‘CPC’), is directed against judgment and decree dated 
22.11.2012 passed by learned Additional District Judge, 
Depalpur as well as judgment and decree dated 14.03.2011 
passed by learned Civil Judge, Depalpur.  
2. 
The facts, necessary for the decision of this 
appeal, are that Sardar Muhammad Boota (Boota) filed suit 
No. 255 of 2010 (the ‘suit’) against Jaffar Ali (Jaffar) and 

RSA No. 02 of 2013 
2 
others for specific performance of agreement dated 17.02.2000 
/ Exh. P1 (the ‘agreement’) while stating that land measuring 
172-kanals 15-marlas, as further detailed in the suit, was 
agreed to be sold by Jaffar to Boota and one Muhammad 
Akram in equal share against consideration of Rs. 1,079,687/-, 
out of which Rs. 784,487/- were paid; that the litigation 
between Muhammad Akram and Jaffar went upto the 
Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan and as a consequence 
of the same, Muhammad Akram got his share in the aforesaid 
land, whereas, Jaffar refused to accept remaining consideration 
and pass on the title of the 50% share of the above said land 
(the ‘suit land’).  
3.  
 The suit was dismissed as withdrawn on 
11.11.2002 when Jaffar and Boota gave the statement that one 
Syed Afzaal Ali Gillani has been appointed as an arbitrator. 
After dismissal of the suit as withdrawn the suit land was sold 
by Jaffar through deeds and documents which are on record as 
various exhibits (the ‘subsequent transactions’) and on the 
strength of the same, Shoukat Ali / respondent No. 2 became 
beneficiary. On 23.04.2003 an application was filed by Boota 
for restoration of the suit. Jaffar never filed any reply to this 
application for restoration or revival of the suit. Somehow, 
vide ex-parte order dated 27.01.2004 the suit was restored. 
Thereafter, the subsequent purchasers including Shoukat Ali / 

RSA No. 02 of 2013 
3 
respondent No. 2 were impleaded in the array of parties and 
amended suit was filed. The suit was also contested by the said 
parties. Since amendments were made and parties were arrayed 
as defendants, the learned trial Court framed issues on two 
different dates i.e. 23.02.2005 and 24.07.2006. The framed 
issues are as under:- 
 
Issues framed on 23-02-05 
1. Whether this suit is false and frivolous and 
defendant is entitled to special costs U/S 
35-A C.P.C.? OPD 
2. Whether 
defendant 
entered 
into 
an 
agreement to sell With plaintiff regarding 
suit property and received Rs; 784487/- as 
earnest money? OPP 
3. Whether plaintiff is entitled to a decree for 
specific performance of disputed agreement 
to sell? OPP 
4. Relief. 
 
Issues Framed on 24-07-06 
1. Whether the plaintiff and defendant NO1 
are collusive and suit has been filed with 
malafide, hence, plaintiff is not entitled to 
any relief? OPD-2 
2. Whether the defendant NO:2 is bonafide 
purchaser of suit land and is owner in 
possession of suit land, hence statement of 
defendant NO:1 dated 23-02-2006 and 18-
03-06 in favour of the plaintiff are illegal, 
void and ineffective upon the rights of 
defendant NO:2? OPD-2 
3. Relief. 
  
  From the plaintiff-side six witnesses were 
produced and about ten documents were made part of the 
record as exhibits. From the defendant-side, DW-1 to DW-10 
appeared and Exh.  D1 to Exh. D11 were produced in course of 

RSA No. 02 of 2013 
4 
evidence. The learned trial Court gave issue-wise findings and 
the prayer in the suit was declined vide judgment and decree 
dated 14.03.2011. However, Boota was held entitled for the 
reimbursement of Rs. 539,843/- from Jaffar. The parties were 
left to bear their own costs. Dissatisfied from the same, civil 
appeal No. 69 of 2011 was filed which was dismissed vide 
judgment and decree dated 22.11.2012. Being aggrieved, the 
same has been challenged by Boota through this second 
appeal.  
4.   
 Mr. Iftikhar Ahmad Chohan, learned counsel for 
the appellant has stated that subsequent transactions are hit by 
principle of lis pendence as the matter between Jaffar and 
Boota was before the arbitrator. He has submitted that since 
the subsequent transactions have taken place during the 
pendency of the suit and / or the arbitration, therefore, heavy 
burden was on Shoukat Ali / respondent No. 2 to prove his 
bona fide. He has referred to various judgments including 
cases titled “Bahar Shah and Others Versus Manzoor Ahmad” 
(2022 SCMR 284) “ Rao Abdul Rehman (Deceased) through 
legal heirs Versus Muhammad Afzal (Deceased) through legal 
heirs and Others”  (2023 SCMR 815) and “ Muhammad 
Ashraf Butt and Others Versus Muhammad Asif Bhatti and 
Others”  (PLD 2011 Supreme Court 905) and stated that 
section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act-1882 (the ‘Act’) 

RSA No. 02 of 2013 
5 
applies to the subsequent transactions.  
5.  
 On the other hand, Rana Muhammad Anwar, 
learned counsel for Shoukat Ali / respondent No. 2 has 
vehemently opposed this appeal and he has stated that 
restoration of the suit as well as subsequent statements dated 
23.02.2006 and 18.03.2006 clearly show the collusiveness 
between Boota and Jaffar, therefore, the rule of lis pendence  is 
not attracted. He has further stated that withdrawal of the suit, 
so-called reference to arbitrator and then the restoration of the 
suit are result of fraud committed in the Court; that it was 
never intended to get the matter resolved through arbitration 
but to give effect to the plan of manipulation and it is an 
attempt to cheat innocent buyer(s). He has added that there is 
no provision in law permitting to restore a suit which was 
dismissed as withdrawn, unconditionally but somehow the suit 
was restored on 27.01.2004; that the same was never 
challenged by Jaffar, deliberately and Shoukat Ali / respondent 
No. 2 became party much later when there was no chance left 
to raise challenge to this illegality. 
6.  
 I have heard the arguments and very carefully 
gone through the record with the able assistance of learned 
counsel for the parties. 
7.  
 Section 52 of the Act provides that during the 
pendency in any Court….. of any suit or proceeding which is 

RSA No. 02 of 2013 
6 
not collusive and in which any right to immovable property is 
directly and specifically in question, the property cannot be 
transferred or otherwise dealt with by any party to the suit or 
proceeding so as to affect the rights of any other party thereto 
under any decree or order which may be made therein, except 
under the authority of the Court and on such terms as it may 
impose. It embodies the rule of lis pendence, which are both 
available in Equity and Common Law. The legislature has 
provided a clear exception to applicability of this rule in the 
cases where collusive action is involved. In case titled 
“Muhammad Zafar-uz-Zaman and 4 Others Versus Faqir 
Muhammad through Legal Heirs” (PLD 2001 Supreme 
Court 449), the Honourable Supreme Court has ruled that true 
scope of section 52 of the Act does not prevent the vesting of 
title in transferee in a sale pendent lite but only makes it 
subject to rights of other parties as decided in the suit. It will 
be advantageous to reproduce the following extract of the said 
judgment:- 
 “The true scope of section 52 of the Transfer of 
Property Act, therefore, is that it does not prevent 
the vesting of title in a transferee in a sale 
pendente lite but only makes it subject to the 
rights of other parties as decided in the suit. In 
other words, the effect of section 52 is not to wipe 
out a sale pendente lite altogether, but to 
subordinate it to the rights based on the decree in 
the suit As between the parties to the transaction, 
however, it is perfectly valid, and operates to vest 
the title of the transferor in the transferee.” 
 
  
In case titled “ Fazal Karim through Legal Heirs 

RSA No. 02 of 2013 
7 
and Others Versus Muhamamd Afzal through Legal Heirs and 
Others (PLD 2003 Supreme Court 818) the Honourable 
Supreme Court of Pakistan has observed that the exception of 
collusiveness or fraud is not only applicable to the 
commencement of proceedings but the parties are precluded to 
have benefit of section 52 of the Act if this collusiveness is 
made during the proceedings or a decree is obtained by 
collusion, which otherwise, or initially started with bona fide. I 
would like to reproduce paragraphs No. 12 and 13 of this 
judgment:- 
 
 “12. We are also confronted with another 
phenomenon that at times the judicial proceedings 
do not commence with collusion or fraud but 
subsequently the parties resort to collusion as 
well as fraud in order to jeopardize the right or 
interest of a third party. The proceedings may not 
be collusive from the very inception but collusion, 
if resorted to subsequently, is as good a collusion 
as that intended from the very beginning. In 
Periamurugappa Asari v. Manicka Chetty AIR 
1926 Madras 50, Venkatasubba Rao, J. observed, 
also with reference to a compromise, that a 
decree passed in pursuance of a compromise does 
not exclude the application of section 52 provided 
that such compromise is not tainted with fraud or 
collusion. A genuine compromise is a normal 
conduct of the parties and is not taken to be 
collusive but a compromise entered into by 
collusion or fraud excludes the application of 
section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act. It is 
altogether immaterial as 
to 
whether 
the 
proceedings were collusive from the very 
inception or they became so at some subsequent 
stage. A suit may be collusive even at its very 
inception or a decree may be obtained by 
collusion in a suit which had initially started 
bona fide.  
   13. We, therefore, hold that in cases which are 

RSA No. 02 of 2013 
8 
collusive at the very inception and the cases 
where decree is obtained by collusion or fraud, 
section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act would 
not be applicable regardless of the fact, in the 
latter case, that the proceedings were initiated 
with honesty.” 
 
   
 
 
       (Emphasis supplied) 
  
Much focus is made by Mr. Iftikhar Ahmad 
Chohan, learned counsel for the appellant, on “Bahar Shah and 
Others” and “ Rao Abdul Rehman (Deceased) through legal 
heirs” cases (supra) while stating that the conduct of Shoukat 
Ali / respondent No. 2 lacks bona fide and the subsequent 
transactions were not with due diligence, however, he ignored 
that the said two judgments also recognize that whether in a 
particular case a person acted with honesty or not will 
obviously depend on the facts of each case. The good faith 
entails righteous and rational approach with good sense of 
right and wrong which excludes the element of deceitfulness, 
lack of fair-mindedness and uprightness and or willful 
negligence.  
8.   
 Now reverting to the facts of the case. Boota and 
Jaffar made statements on 11.11.2002 that they are referring 
the matter to Syed Afzaal Ali Gillani, the then minister of 
health, for resolution of the dispute. After recording their 
statements and at the request of Boota, the suit was dismissed 
as withdrawn.  It is admitted that no arbitration took place and 
it appears to me that even the proceedings in arbitration never 

RSA No. 02 of 2013 
9 
commenced. Boota, after five months of dismissal of the suit, 
filed an application for restoration and for no reason Jaffar 
opted not to contest the same, resulting into restoration of the 
suit, which was dismissed as withdrawn without even 
permission to file afresh. The matter was required to be seen 
under Order XXIII of CPC and other relevant provisions of 
CPC. Learned counsel for the appellant had no answer when 
he was asked if the failure of arbitration could have been a 
fresh cause of action but Boota and Jaffar opted to get the 
dismissed suit restored; apparently to take benefit of the rule of 
lis pendence or section 52 of the Act.  
9.  
 It is very important in this case that initially 
Jaffar kept resisting the suit. He filed contested written 
statement upon which issues were framed but somehow he has 
not contested the application for restoration of the suit and 
after the order of restoration passed on 27.01.2004, he made 
statement on 23.02.2006 and 18.03.2006 in favour of Boota. I 
have no doubt in my mind about the collusiveness of Jaffar and 
Boota.  
10.  
 It is also significant that it was originally 
pleaded that the agreement was made in favour of two persons 
namely Boota and one Muhammad Akram; that thereafter, 
Muhammad Akram remained successful to obtain his land for 
which the litigation went up-till the Honourable Supreme 

RSA No. 02 of 2013 
10 
Court of Pakistan. However, Muhammad Akram never 
claimed his right under the agreement. This fact was conceded 
by Boota in his cross-examination when he appeared as PW-5 
and he confirmed that it is correct that mutation No. 1419 in 
favour of Muhammad Akram is not passed in pursuance to the 
agreement. Boota produced only one marginal witness namely 
Nawaz. His witness Karamat Ali Sarwar /   PW-1 also stated 
that he has no knowledge if any fraud was committed with 
Boota. Tufail Bhatti, scribe (PW-2) contradicted the statement 
of PW-1 as to the purchase of stamp paper (both stated 
contradictory to each other as to the person who purchased the 
stamp paper of Exh. P1). PW-3 and PW-4 are son-in-law and 
brother of Boota, respectively.  
11.  
On the other hand, ten witnesses appeared from 
the defendant-side. I have noticed that maximum efforts were 
made, during the lengthy cross-examination of the said 
witnesses, to extract something adverse to the interest of the 
subsequent purchasers or Shoukat Ali / respondent No. 2. The 
evidence besides some minor infirmities remained coherent. 
Shoukat Ali / respondent No. 2 produced scribes of different 
deeds. DW-4 / Noor Muhammad stated that inquiry was made 
from tehsildar office as to any other agreement with respect to 
the suit land. He stated that no suit at the relevant time was 
pending in any Court, which even otherwise is an admitted fact 

RSA No. 02 of 2013 
11 
in this case.  DW-6 / Ghulam Yasin stated that Jaffar and 
Boota in collusion with each other have maintained the suit.  
12.  
 After carefully going through the record, I am of 
the firm opinion that the learned two Courts below have not 
committed any mistake in reading the evidence led by two-
sides and they have arrived to the correct conclusion, therefore, 
this regular second appeal having no merits is dismissed. No 
order as to costs.
