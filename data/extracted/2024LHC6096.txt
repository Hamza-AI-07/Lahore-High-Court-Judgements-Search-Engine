Mian Muhammad Awais, Advocate with the petitioner.  
Through this application filed under Section 526 Cr.P.C., the 
applicant seeks transfer of the trial of private complaint titled 
„Shabnam Riaz vs. Naila Karim‟ offences under Section 499, 500 & 
501 PPC from the court of Mr. Majid Waqar Aheer, Additional 
Sessions Judge, Lahore to any other court of competent jurisdiction. 
2. 
Arguments heard; record perused.  
3. 
The aforementioned private complaint was filed as far back as 
the year 2020. Respondent No. 1/accused was summoned to stand trial 
on 02.12.2020 and was formally indicted on 29.07.2021. However, the 
trial has yet to be concluded, having been delayed repeatedly for one 
reason or another. This transfer application has been filed mainly on 
the grounds that the learned trial judge has allegedly become 
prejudiced and biased against the applicant, raising concerns that a 
just and impartial decision may not be possible. 
4. 
The transfer of a case from one court to another on the grounds 
of alleged bias and prejudice against a judicial officer is a matter of 
critical significance. Such accusations directly challenge the integrity 
and impartiality of the judge, therefore, the same must not be treated 
lightly, as unfounded allegations can undermine public confidence in 
the judicial system and unjustly harm the reputation of judicial 
officers without cause. It has regrettably become a prevalent trend to 
levy baseless allegations against judges, undermining the image,

dignity, and honor of the judiciary in the eyes of the public at large. 
Such practices must be firmly suppressed and addressed with resolute 
measures to preserve the sanctity of judicial institutions. 
5. 
The core principle governing the acceptance of a transfer 
application is the assurance of a fair trial, as enshrined in Article 10-A 
of The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. A free 
and fair trial is a sine qua non of our criminal justice system. The 
guarantee of a fair trial is the foremost imperative in the 
administration of justice and serves as the central criterion for the 
court’s consideration when evaluating a motion for transfer of a case. 
For the transfer of a criminal case, the party must demonstrate a 
reasonable apprehension that justice will not be served. A fundamental 
principle of the justice system is that it must not only be done but also 
be seen to be done. The apprehension of not receiving a fair and 
impartial inquiry or trial must be reasonable and grounded in facts, 
rather than being speculative or based on conjecture and surmise. The 
proceedings pending before one competent court should not be 
transferred to another court merely on bald assertions or allegations of 
any of the parties unless the same are supported by strong, cogent 
reasons and convincing evidence.   
6. 
The bias in a judge must be demonstrated as a fact, not merely 
as an opinion. A real likelihood of bias must be established, grounded 
in personal prejudice so significant that it impairs the judge’s ability to 
act impartially in the specific case. The Supreme Court of Pakistan has 
addressed the issue of transferring cases based on allegations of 
judicial bias. In the case titled “Ms. BENAZIR BHUTTO vs. THE 
PRESIDENT OF PAKISTAN and another” (1992 SCMR 140), the 
Court emphasized that mere allegations of bias or prejudice against a 
judge are insufficient grounds for transferring a case. The Court held 
that such allegations must be substantiated with clear and credible 
evidence demonstrating a reasonable apprehension of bias to warrant a 
transfer.

Crl. Misc. No.80981-T/2024 
 
 
7. 
The apprehension, foreseen by the applicant, is neither 
plausible nor substantiated through any material/evidence. Nothing 
has been presented on the record to substantiate that the trial judge 
harbors any bias or prejudice against the applicant, nor is there any 
indication that he has revealed a predisposition to decide against her. 
The grounds presented by the applicant fail to establish any reasonable 
apprehension of being denied a fair trial, as they lack sufficient merit 
to raise concern in the mind of a prudent and reasonable person. The 
allegations appear to be much ado about nothing, lacking any credible 
foundation. Without clear evidence/material, such claims do little 
more than cast unwarranted aspersions on the impartiality of the trial 
judge, an act that is both baseless and deeply unwarranted. 
8. 
For what has been discussed above, the instant transfer 
application having no force is dismissed in limine. However, the trial 
court is directed to ensure a fair, transparent, and expeditious 
conclusion of the trial being an old matter, preferably within three 
months, in strict accordance with the law and without any fear or 
favor. Compliance report in this regard shall be filed through Deputy 
Registrar (Judicial) of this Court.
