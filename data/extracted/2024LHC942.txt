JUDGMENT 
Date of Hearing: 
04.03.2024 
Petitioner By: 
Mr. Shahzad Rabbani, Advocate 
Respondents By: 
Miss Maryam, Advocate 
Mr. Asad Raza Advocate 
Mr. Nasir Javed Ghumman, Deputy Attorney General 
 
ABID HUSSAIN CHATTHA, J: This constitutional Petition brings a 
challenge to Orders dated 30.11.2022 and 02.01.2023 passed by Respondents 
No. 2 and 4, respectively and seeks a direction to the Respondents to the effect 
that they are not entitled to forfeit bank guarantee No. IGT12420144322PK 
dated 27.04.2022 tendered by the Petitioner as bid security. 
2. 
 
Succinctly, the Petitioner in a joint venture mode participated in 
tender No. NOR-4387-2022 for design, manufacture, supply, installation, 
testing and commissioning of plant for 500 / 132 KV grid station, Allama 
Iqbal Industrial City / M-3, Faisalabad floated by National Transmission and 
Dispatch Company Limited (the “NTDC”), a public limited company, 
wholly owned by the Federal Government in accordance with Single Stage-
Two Envelope (SSTE) procedure. The tender was issued pursuant to the 
Public Procurement Regulatory Authority Ordinance, 2002 (the “PPRA 
Ordinance”) read with the Public Procurement Rules, 2004 (the “Rules, 
2004”). In order to participate in the bidding process, the Petitioner submitted 
bid security in accordance with the bidding documents in terms of Rule 25 of 

2 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 685 / 2023 
 
 
 
 
the Rules, 2004 read with Clause IB 15 of Section 1-„Instructions to Bidders‟ 
in the form of a bank guarantee issued by Respondent No. 5 on the request of 
the Petitioner. 
3. 
 
Four bidders including the Petitioner participated in the tender 
process out of which two bidders, the Petitioner and another were declared as 
technically qualified. On 16.09.2022, the financial bids of the said two 
bidders were opened. The Petitioner quoted the lowest bid at Rs. 
9,570,858,540/- while the second lowest bid was of Rs. 10,279,025,550/- as 
per prevailing exchange rate at the given date. 
4. 
 
During the process of price post-bid evaluation, Respondent No. 
3, the consultant of NTDC raised certain queries and the Petitioner was 
directed to confirm the same. The corrections as desired by Respondent No. 3 
were all catered for by the Petitioner. Subsequently, another price post-bid 
clarification No.  3 was sought vide letter dated 12.10.2022 which was 
replied by the Petitioner through letter dated 14.10.2022, whereby, all the 
corrections as desired by Respondent No. 3 were made and confirmed by the 
Petitioner. However, the Petitioner did not receive any response after 
submitting the above clarifications and after about 45 days from the date of 
reply of the Petitioner, Respondent No. 2 issued the impugned Order dated 
30.11.2022 through which the Petitioner was informed that its bid has been 
rejected and bid security forfeited pursuant to Clause IB 26.2(e) of Section 1-
„Instructions to Bidders‟, as the Petitioner has refused to accept arithmetical 
corrections according to the criteria of arithmetic corrections laid down in 
Clause IB 26.2. The Petitioner was also informed that the bidding process of 
subject tender has been annulled pursuant to Rule 33 of the Rules, 2004, as 
such, re-bidding process will be initiated within due course of time. 
5. 
 
The Petitioner vide letter dated 02.12.2022 informed Respondent 
No. 2 that according to Clause IB 26.2(e) of Section 1-„Instructions to 
Bidders‟, the bid security cannot be forfeited. Inaction on the part of NTDC 
compelled the Petitioner to institute W. P. No. 77737 / 2022. The Court, in 
the first instance, referred the matter to the Grievance Redressal Committee 
(the “GRC”) / Respondent No. 4 under Rule 48 of the Rules, 2004. Through 

3 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 685 / 2023 
 
 
 
 
the impugned Order dated 02.01.2023, the GRC rejected claim of the 
Petitioner by merely stating that grievance of the Petitioner qua forfeiting its 
bid security is declined keeping in view the relevant documents / information. 
Hence, this Petition. 
6. 
 
Learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the impugned 
order passed by Respondent No. 4 is non-speaking as no reason whatsoever 
has been assigned by the GRC while declining request of the Petitioner for 
release of bid security. He further asserted that NTDC forfeited bid security 
based upon the assumption that the Petitioner refused to accept arithmetical 
error in one of the items in its bid price, however, the Petitioner did not 
refuse to accept a single arithmetic error as desired by NTDC. This is 
notwithstanding that mere inadvertent mentioning of incorrect unit rate of 
item K-8 was not an arithmetic error but only a typographical mistake which 
is evident from the fact that the total bid price remained unaffected and 
listing of incorrect unit rate resulting in incorrect price of a sub-item was 
elaborately explained in response to the clarifications sought by NTDC. 
However, without accepting or rejecting explanation / clarification offered by 
the Petitioner, the latter was simply apprised that its bid has been rejected on 
account of its refusal to accept the arithmetic correction as desired by NTDC. 
He further contended that even otherwise, bid security of the Petitioner could 
not have been confiscated in terms of IB 26.2(e) under Clause IB 15.7 of 
Section 1-„Instructions to Bidders‟. Moreover, the impugned Order dated 
30.11.2022 depicts that instead of pursuing price post-bid clarification No. 3, 
NTDC itself had annulled the tender pursuant to Rule 33 of the Rules, 2004 
and opted for re-bidding the subject procurement. As such, penalty in terms 
of confiscation of bid security is unlawful and highly unjust based on mala 
fide when the whole tender process was scrapped by NTDC without 
assigning any reason. 
7. 
 
Conversely, learned counsel for the Respondents heavily relied 
upon preliminary objection qua maintainability of this Petition in terms of 
Rule 48(7) of the Rules, 2004 which provides a remedy of appeal to the 
Petitioner against the decision of GRC before the Public Procurement 

4 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 685 / 2023 
 
 
 
 
Regulatory Authority (the “Authority”) constituted under the PPRA 
Ordinance. Reliance was placed on an unreported Judgment of this Court 
dated 05.10.2023 passed in case titled, “M/s Ahmad & Co. v. SNGPL etc.” 
(W. P. No. 63291 / 2023). Other objections were not pressed. On merits, it 
was asserted that in terms of Clause IB 26.2(e) of Section 1-„Instructions to 
Bidders‟, when the bidder does not accept arithmetic corrections in terms of 
Clause IB 26.2, the bid security is liable to be confiscated. Hence, the bid 
security of the Petitioner has been aptly and lawfully forfeited and the 
Petitioner is not entitled for release of the same. Learned Federal Law Officer 
also intervened to object that this Petition is not maintainable since the 
Federal Government has not been independently impleaded as party to this 
Petition. 
8. 
 
In rebuttal, learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the 
scope and mandate of GRC is limited which postulates an ongoing 
procurement process. However, as NTDC had annulled the procurement 
process, therefore, GRC had no mandate to decide grievance of the 
Petitioner. This was candidly stated while arguing W. P. No. 77737 / 2022 
but the Court in its own wisdom referred the matter to GRC in the first 
instance. He further stated that even otherwise, the remedy of appeal under 
Rule 48(7) of the Rules is not an adequate and efficacious remedy which 
cannot be availed without paying an onerous requisite fee equivalent to 0.2% 
of the procurement value. In the present case, when the Petitioner is striving 
for release of his bid security, the payment of such an onerous additional 
amount would be a double jeopardy. Hence, the constitutional jurisdiction of 
this Court is always available which has been lawfully invoked by the 
Petitioner for redressal of its grievance. He clarified that NTDC is an 
independent entity run by a board of directors appointed by the Federal 
Government and as such, there is no requirement to separately array the 
Federal Government as party to this Petition. 
9. 
 
From rival contentions of the parties, following points emerge 
for determination by this Court:- 

5 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 685 / 2023 
 
 
 
 
i) 
Whether this Petition is maintainable in view of Rule 
48(7) of the Rules, 2004 which provides remedy of appeal 
to the Petitioner; and 
 
ii) 
Whether the Petitioner is entitled for release of bid 
security. 
10. 
 
In Order to address the first query, it will be beneficial to 
reproduce Rule 48 of the Rules, 2004 which pertains to redressal of grievance 
by the procuring agency. It importantly reads as under:- 
“48. Redressal of grievances by the procuring agency.---  
(1)  
The procuring agency shall constitute a committee 
comprising of odd number of persons, with necessary 
powers and authorizations, to address the complaints of 
bidders that may occur prior to the entry into force of the 
procurement contract. 
(2) 
Any party may file its written complaint against the 
eligibility parameters, evaluation criteria or any other 
terms and conditions prescribed in the bidding documents 
if found contrary to the provisions of the procurement 
regulatory framework, and the same shall be addressed 
by the grievance redressal committee (GRC) well before 
the proposal submission deadline. 
(3) 
Any bidder feeling aggrieved by any act of the procuring 
agency after the submission of his bid may lodge a written 
complaint concerning his grievances within seven days of 
announcement of the technical evaluation report and five 
days after issuance of final evaluation report. 
(4) 
In case, the complaint is filed against the technical 
evaluation report, the GRC shall suspend the procurement 
proceedings. 
(5) 
In case, the complaint is filed after the issuance of the 
final evaluation report, the complainant cannot raise any 
objection on technical evaluation of the report: 
Provided that the complainant may raise the objection on 
any part of the final evaluation report in case where 
single stage single envelope bidding procedure is 
adopted. 
(6) 
The GRC shall investigate and decide upon the complaint 
within ten days of its receipt. 
(7) 
Any bidder or party not satisfied with the decision of the 
GRC, may file an appeal before the Authority within thirty 
days of communication of the decision subject to 

6 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 685 / 2023 
 
 
 
 
depositing the prescribed fee and in accordance with the 
procedure issued by the Authority. The decision of the 
Authority shall be considered as final.” 
11. 
 
Perusal of Rule 48 of the Rules, 2004 clearly reveals that by way 
of subordinate legislation, a dispute resolution mechanism was provided by 
constituting the GRC within the ambit of the procuring agency itself to 
address multiple complaints of the bidders that may occur prior to the entry 
into force of the procurement contract. The rationale is to ensure that the 
bidding process may be conducted smoothly and unnecessary litigation 
outside the procurement framework may be avoided. Rule 48.2 of the Rules, 
2004 specifically states that any party may file a written complaint with 
respect to eligibility parameters, evaluation criteria or any other terms and 
conditions prescribed in the bidding documents if found contrary to the 
procurement regulatory framework and the same shall be addressed by the 
GRC well before the proposal submission deadline. This Rule is not attracted 
as the Petitioner did not have any grievance with respect to eligibility 
parameters, evaluation criteria or any other terms and conditions prescribed 
in the bidding documents contrary to the procurement regulatory framework. 
Similarly, Rule 48.3 of the Rules confers a right to the bidder qua his 
grievance to lodge a complaint against any act of the procuring agency after 
submission of his bid within seven days of announcement of the technical 
evaluation report and five days after issuance of final evaluation report. In the 
instant case, the Petitioner was declared as technically qualified and had no 
grievance regarding the technical evaluation report. However, the final 
evaluation report had not been issued as NTDC had annulled the process of 
procurement during evaluation of financial bids. Thus, the grievance had 
occurred at a stage after issuance of technical evaluation report but before 
issuance of the final evaluation report with respect to rejection of bid of the 
Petitioner and confiscation of its bid security. As such, the GRC could validly 
take cognizance of the grievance and a decision thereon in accordance with 
law. 
12. 
 
Rule 48(7) of the Rules, 2004 provides the remedy of appeal 
before the Authority against the decision of GRC. However, the remedy of 

7 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 685 / 2023 
 
 
 
 
appeal under Rule 48(7) of the Rules, 2004 is subject to depositing the 
prescribed fee. In the instant case, requiring the Petitioner to deposit a heavy 
amount of fee, who is striving to release its bid security, would definitely be 
harsh and onerous when the procurement process had been scrapped and 
even the decision of GRC was completely non-speaking. Under these 
circumstances, the Petitioner cannot be compelled to seek redressal of its 
grievance within the regulatory framework by way of appeal. This precise 
question was addressed in case titled, “Messrs Zohongding International 
Engineering Co. Ltd. through Authorized Representative v. National 
Highway Authority and 2 others” (2023 CLC 1163). The relevant paragraphs 
No. 6 to 8 are reproduced as under:- 
“6. Regulation 7 of the 2021 Regulations provides that the 
appellant shall append with every appeal a demand draft / pay 
order of a non-refundable fee as per Schedule-II of these 
Regulations. Furthermore, it provides that P.P.R.A. shall not 
entertain any appeal which is filed without the prescribed fee. 
Schedule-II to the said Regulations requires the payment of 
Rs.5,00,000/- as the fee for filing an appeal where the contract 
or procurement is up to the limit of Rs.250 million. The said 
Schedule requires 0.2% of the procurement value not exceeding 
Rs.5 million to be the fee for filing an appeal where the contract 
or procurement exceeds the limit of Rs.250 million. 
7. The petitioner had filed a fee of Rs.5,00,000/- along with its 
appeal filed before P.P.R.A. which is not entertaining the appeal 
as it considers that the fee in this case should be 0.2% of the 
procurement value which would come to an amount not 
exceeding Rs.5 million. 
8. The vital question that needs to be answered is whether this 
Court should decline to assume jurisdiction due to the 
availability of the remedy of appeal under Rule 48(7) of the 
2004 Rules against the decision of the G.R.C. It is well settled 
that the invocation of jurisdiction under Article 199 of the 
Constitution is not available in cases where the remedy of 
statutory appeal is available and such remedy is effective and 
adequate. Given that an appellant before P.P.R.A. is required by 
Regulation 7 read with Schedule-II of the 2021 Regulations to 
deposit a disproportionately high fee for filing an appeal under 
Rule 48(7) of the 2004 Rules, I am of the view that such an 
appeal cannot be considered to be an effective and adequate 
remedy which is as equally efficacious as invoking the 
Constitutional jurisdiction of this Court. The availability of the 
remedy of an appeal under Rule 48(7) of the 2004 Rules before 

8 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 685 / 2023 
 
 
 
 
P.P.R.A. against the decision of G.R.C. cannot be considered to 
be a bar against the petitioner's right to file a Constitutional 
petition before this Court against the decision of the G.R.C. 
because I find the quantum of the fee for filing an appeal 
specified in Regulation 7 read with Schedule-II to the 2021 
Regulations to be highly arbitrary, onerous and excessive.”   
13. 
 
It, therefore, follows that normal rule is that when an alternate 
remedy is available to a party, it is required to pursue that remedy and the 
right to invoke constitutional jurisdiction of this Court is not available. 
However, where it is established that the available alternate remedy is not 
efficacious, the existence of such remedy is not an absolute bar to invoke the 
constitutional jurisdiction of this Court under Article 199 of the Constitution 
of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. The reliance by learned counsel 
for the Respondents on M/s Ahmad & Co. case (supra) is misconceived as in 
the said case, the Petitioner therein had assailed the evaluation report in an 
ongoing procurement process. Moreover, NTDC as a procurement agency is 
an independent company run by a board of directors appointed by the Federal 
Government, therefore, there was no need to independently implead Federal 
Government as a Respondent. Hence, the objections of the Respondents qua 
maintainability of this Petition are overruled.   
14. 
 
Section 1-„Instructions to Bidders‟, Clause IB 15 pertains to bid 
security. It is apparent that the provision of bid security acceptable to NTDC 
was a pre-requisite to participate in the bidding process. Clause IB 15.4 
stipulates that any bid not accompanied by an acceptable bid security shall be 
considered by NTDC as non-responsive pursuant to Clause IB 24. Clause IB 
15.5 provides that the bid securities of unsuccessful bidders will be returned 
upon award of contract to the successful bidder or on the expiry of validity of 
bid security whichever is earlier. Clause IB 15.6 proclaims that the bid 
security of the successful bidder will be returned when the bidder has 
furnished the required performance security pursuant to Clause IB 34 and 
signed the contract agreement pursuant to Clause IB 35. The rationale of 
submission of provision of bid security is encapsulated in Clause IB 15.3 
which provides that the same is required to protect the employer against the 

9 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 685 / 2023 
 
 
 
 
risk of bidder‟s conduct which would warrant the security‟s forfeiture 
pursuant to Clause IB 15.7 and the same is reproduced as under:- 
 
“15.7 The Bid Security may be forfeited: 
(a)  
if a Bidder withdraws its bid during the period of Bid 
validity, except as provided in sub-clause IB 16.2; or 
(b)  
if a Bidder does not accept the arithmetical corrections of 
his Bid Price, pursuant to Sub-Clause 24.2 thereof; or 
(c)  
if a bidder is found involved in corrupt and fraudulent 
practices; or  
(d)  
in the case of a successful Bidder, if he fails to: 
(i)  
furnish the required Performance Security in 
accordance with Clause IB.34, or 
(ii)  
sign the Contract Agreement, in accordance with 
Clause IB.35.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Emphasis Supplied) 
15. 
 
Clause IB 24 pertains to preliminary examination and 
determination of responsiveness of bid. Clause IB 24.2 is reproduced as 
under:- 
“24.2  The Employer shall confirm that the following documents 
and information have been provided in the Technical Bid. If any 
of these documents or information is missing, the offer shall be 
rejected. 
 
(a) 
Letter of Technical Bid is unsigned pursuant to IB 17.5 or 
altered pursuant to lB 17.3; 
(b) 
written confirmation of authorization to commit the 
Bidder; 
(c) 
bid is not accompanied by a substantially compliant bid 
security as per IB 15.4; 
(d) 
it covers scope of work given in Bidding Documents 
partially. 
(e) 
Technical Proposal in accordance with IB 14A.” 
It is apparent from bare perusal of the above Clause that the Petitioner was 
compliant with the same as admittedly his technical bid had been accepted. 
NTDC did not invoke Clause IB 24.2 reproduced above in the impugned 
Order dated 30.11.2022, rather, invoked Clause IB 26.2(e) to reject bid of the 
Petitioner and in consequence thereof, forfeited its bid security which is not 
mentioned in Clause IB 15.7 reproduced above under which a bid security 
could be forfeited. Clause IB 26 pertains to conversion to single currency and 

10 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 685 / 2023 
 
 
 
 
correction of arithmetic errors. The relevant Clause IB 26.2 is reproduced as 
under for ready reference:- 
“26.2 During the evaluation of Price Bids, the Employer shall 
correct arithmetical errors on the following basis: 
(a)  
where there are errors between the total of the amounts 
given under the column for the price breakdown and the 
amount given under the Total Price, the amounts given 
under the column for the price breakdown shall prevail 
and the Total Price will be corrected accordingly; 
(b)  
where there are errors between the total of the amounts of 
Schedule Nos. 1 to 4 and the amount given in Schedule 
No. 5 (Grand Summary), the total of the amounts of 
Schedule Nos. 1 to 4 shall prevail and the Schedule No. 5 
(Grand Summary) will be corrected accordingly; 
(c)  
if there is a discrepancy between the grand total price 
given in Schedule No. 5 (Grand Summary) and the bid 
amount in point (1) of the Letter of Price Bid, the grand 
total price given in Schedule No. 5 (Grand Summary) will 
prevail and the bid amount in point (1) of the Letter of 
Price Bid will be corrected; and 
(d)  
if there is a discrepancy between words and figures, the 
amount in words shall prevail, unless the amount 
expressed in words is related to an arithmetical error, in 
which case the amount in figures shall prevail subject to 
(a), (b) and (c) above. 
(e)  
If the Bidder does not accept the corrected amount of Bid, 
his Bid will be rejected and his Bid Security forfeited as 
per IB 15.7.” 
(Emphasis Supplied) 
16. 
 
It is importantly noted here that although Clause IB 26.2(e) 
reproduced above states that if the bidder does not accept the corrected 
amount of bid, his bid will be rejected and his bid security forfeited according 
to Clause IB 15.7 yet the latter Clause does not allow forfeiture of bid 
security under the former Clause. Hence, it is aptly evident that the bidding 
documents were hit by the doctrine of Contra Proferentem which, according 
to Black‟s Law Dictionary (Tenth Edition), means, „in the interpretation of 
documents, ambiguities are to be construed unfavorably to the drafter‟. It is 
also termed as „ambiguity doctrine’. Thus, it is apparent that the bidding 
documents were ambiguous and as per Clause IB 15.7, the bid security could 
not have been forfeited pursuant to Clause IB 26.2(e) for omission to mention 
the said Clause therein. 

11 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 685 / 2023 
 
 
 
 
17. 
 
Notwithstanding the fact that Clause IB 26.2(e) of Section 1- 
„Instructions to Bidders‟ could not have been invoked in terms of Clause IB 
15.7 yet under the former Clause, bid of the Petitioner could have been 
rejected and his bid security was liable to be forfeited only if the bidder does 
not accept the corrected amount of bid. This necessitates to examine if the 
Petitioner had refused to accept the correct amount of bid or arithmetic 
corrections in his bid price as desired by NTDC. Letter dated 12.10.2022 
depicts that the Petitioner with reference to price post-bid clarification No. 3 
was required to confirm certain queries which were duly responded to as 
depicted from communication dated 14.10.2022. The relevant query in letter 
dated 12.10.2022 is with respect to Items No. 4 & 7 which is reproduced as 
under:-

W. P. No. 685 / 2023 
 
 
 
 
In this behalf, the Petitioner submitted its reply which is also reproduced as 
under:- 
Reply of Item No. 4: 
“We have already accepted the arithmetic errors in Schedule 4 
through your clarification No. 2 dated 23/09/2022 including the 
total change in Grand summary schedule no.5. 
We have quoted the correct total amount in the column for K-8 
for price breakdown which is PKR 41,534,157 and quoted the 
correct sub total amount of Item No. K-8 which is PKR 
41,534,157. Therefore, there is no arithmetic error between the 
prevailing total amounts. However, there is a genuine typo 
mistake while formulating in the excel sheet which resulted in the 
incorrect unit rate. The total Price of K-8 Supply and placing of 
river run gravel blanket including side retaining wall in 
switchyard area with Qty. 6500 Cum is 41,534,156.76 PKR, the 
unit price is 6,389.87 PKR and the same was added to total of 
Sch.4 and Sch.5 grand summary. The cost for Item K-8 gravel 
cannot be PKR 333 billion and we have provided the breakup 
unit rates which can be checked and verified from any local 
vendor of gravel and our total price quoted is reflective of those 
standard market rates. 
Our actual intention was to quote the lump sum price for K-8 due 
to shortage of time during bid preparation and provide the 
breakdown of unit price if needed later. At the time of bidding the 
total cost for K-8 was PKR 51,284,870 but we applied a discount 
of 20% and the total cost entered was 41,534,157 but 
unfortunately this typo could not be removed. We have provided 
the actual unit price similar to your clarification point 1 without 
any change to the total lump sum amount. We sincerely regret 
any inconvenience caused to your office due to this typo error, e

From bare perusal of the above reply, it is unequivocally clear 
that irrespective of the fact that the aforesaid post bid clarifications were 
arithmetic errors or typographical errors yet the clarifications sought by 
Respondent No. 3 on behalf of NTDC were accepted by the Petitioner and 
that the total bid price remained intact. Further, by no stretch of imagination, 
it could be concluded that the Petitioner had refused to accept the arithmetic 
corrections according to the criteria for such corrections laid down in Clause 
IB 26.2. Therefore, the impugned Order dated 30.11.2022 qua rejection of bid 
of the Petitioner and forfeiture of its bid security is based on erroneous 
assumption that the Petitioner had refused to accept the arithmetic errors, as 
such, the decision to forfeit bid security was unlawful.  
19. 
 
NTDC instead of replying to the response of the Petitioner to 
clarification No. 3, informed the Petitioner through the impugned Order dated 
30.11.2022 that the bidding process of subject tender has been annulled 
pursuant to Rule 33(1) of the Rules, 2004 which provides that the procuring 

14 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 685 / 2023 
 
 
 
 
agency may reject all bids or proposals at any time prior to the acceptance of 
a bid or proposal. It further states that the procuring agency shall upon 
request communicate to any supplier or contractor who submitted a bid or 
proposal, the grounds for rejection of its bid or proposal, but is not required 
to justify those grounds. Rule 33(2) of the Rules, 2004 provides that the 
procuring agency shall incur no liability, solely by virtue of its invoking Rule 
33(1) of the Rules, 2004 towards suppliers or contractors who have submitted 
bids or proposals. However, Rule 33(3) of the Rules, 2004 obligates the 
procuring agency to issue notice of the rejection of bids or proposals 
promptly to all suppliers or contractors that submitted bids or proposals. 
20. 
 
It, therefore, follows that NTDC lawfully exercised its discretion 
to scrap the bidding process in terms of Rule 33 of the Rules, 2004 but was 
not justified to forfeit the bid security of the Petitioner as the bid of the 
second lowest bidder was available and the Petitioner had not refused to 
accept arithmetic corrections in his price bid as required by NTDC. Hence, 
from all angles, the act of NTDC qua forfeiting bid security of the Petitioner 
was unlawful, arbitrary, capricious, unfair, and unjustified. 
21. 
 
In view of the above, this Petition is allowed and the impugned 
Orders dated 30.11.2022 and 02.01.2023 are set aside to the extent of 
forfeiting bid security of the Petitioner. The Respondents are directed to 
release bid security of the Petitioner in the form of bank guarantee if not 
already encashed. In case, the same has been encashed, Respondent No.  1 / 
NTDC shall refund the amount of bid security to the Petitioner within a 
period of thirty (30) days from the date of this Judgment.
