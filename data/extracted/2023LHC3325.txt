Mr. Saghir Ahmad Bhatti, Advocate for petitioner.  
 
 
 
 
Through the instant constitutional petition orders 
dated 22.12.2022 and 06.4.2023 of the courts below 
have been called into question. 
2. 
Heard. 
3. 
The petitioner instituted a suit for possession 
through preemption wherein the stance taken was 
petitioner shared common khewat, passages and 
watercourses and that as such being shafi sharik and 
shafi khalit was entitled to a superior right of 
preemption and that by sale deed No.3935/1 dated 
13.9.2022 the property was secretly sold; that she had 
no 
information 
or 
notice 
thereof 
which 
was 
subsequently gifted orally to the sons of the respondent 
vendee and mutation of oral gift No.5057 dated 
14.9.2022 was also entered and that on coming to know 
she immediately made the necessary talbs and, 
thereafter, filed suit in a timely manner. It was also 
alleged that the transaction had actually been conducted 
for a total consideration of Rs.1,65,00,000/- which was 
exaggeratedly recorded as Rs.2,00,00,000/- in the sale 
deed to repel the claim of the petitioner to preemption 
and that under the circumstances the suit was liable to 
be decreed in her favour. The claim was resisted 
through the written statement filed by the other side. 

W.P. No.9656 of 2023

Along with the suit the petitioner also filed an 
application under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. 
for grant of temporary injunction to restrain alternation 
and change to the nature and condition of property 
pending decision of suit, which after hearing both sides 
was dismissed by the trial court vide order dated 
22.12.2022. The petitioner preferred an appeal 
thereagainst which too was turned down by the learned 
Addl. District Judge vide order dated 06.4.2023. Both 
these orders declining temporary injunction and 
dismissal of appeal have now been assailed in the 
Constitutional jurisdiction. 
4. 
Main stance of the learned counsel is that 
petitioner being shafi sharik and shafi khalit having 
performed the requisite talbs has a prima facie case for 
the grant of temporary injunction and that the court 
below incorrectly ignored this aspect of the matter and 
that the balance of convenience is also in favour of the 
petitioner and that any change in the nature and 
condition of the property would result in irreparable 
loss to the petitioner. 
5. 
Perusal of the application under Order XXXIX, 
Rules 1 and 2, C.P.C.  shows that the application  is 
based on vague assertions and assumptions. The only 
plea raised in paragraph “3”  of the application under 
Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. is that the 
respondent with mala fide intended to change the nature 
and condition of the suit property and was threatening 
to raise construction and making further alienation. The 
response given by the respondent to the application is 
material inasmuch as it is asserted therein that the facts 
asserted by the petitioner were false; that the 
respondents were not in breach of any law; that they 
were peacefully living and law-abiding individuals and 

W.P. No.9656 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
-3- 
 
 
that for the purpose of getting benefit out of their 
property the boundary walls were raised, a gate was 
installed, a room with other constructions comprising 
an office and cattle-shed were constructed, water-pump 
and solar-energy plant were installed at the premises 
and that they were running their business therein which 
was not causing any damage to the  petitioner. The 
petitioner did not either specifically controvert these 
facts nor placed  on record any material to controvert 
the existence of construction at site or the facts as 
narrated in the reply to the application by the 
respondent. In view of these facts, the entire stance of 
the petitioner for seeking injunction was misplaced and 
was rightly repelled by the courts below. 
6. 
Even otherwise the factual position at the moment 
is that the respondents are owners of the property and 
being bona fide purchaser they had every right to use 
the property for beneficial purposes while the petitioner 
at present has no title in the property. The petitioner’s 
claim is based on preemptory right which was 
dependent on the proof of requisite talbs and other facts 
to establish superior right of preemption. At present the 
plea regarding the alleged talbs is just an assertion 
which is yet to be proved by evidence. As against the 
petitioner, the respondents are bona fide transferee for 
consideration  who possibly could not be deprived of 
their rights of uninterrupted use of their property. In 
Zahid Shah v. Shanzeb (2015 YLR 1505) it was 
observed to the effect that in a suit for preemption 
temporary injunction could not be granted against bona 
fide purchaser nor he could be restrained from raising 
construction at his own risk and cost as it would not 
cause any inconvenience to the plaintiff if he ultimately 
succeed in the suit  inasmuch as the bona fide purchaser 

W.P. No.9656 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
-4- 
 
 
had every right to utilize his property until and unless 
decree was passed against him and that to prohibit the 
lawful owner of the constitutional guarantee provided 
under the fundamental rights. In Muhammad Sham and 
others v. Kaneez Zohra Bibi (1983 CLC 2541) it was 
observed to the effect that the vendee being the absolute 
owner has the right to enjoy the possession of the area 
subject matter of suit so long a decree for preemption  is 
not passed against him and it is executed. In 
Hameedullah Khan v. Mst. Shah Jehan Begum and 
others (1989 MLD  1603)  it was observed to the effect 
that the construction on a portion of property duly 
allotted under partition decree was not against law and 
that mere fact the plaintiff could succeed in establishing 
his right of preemption in respect of portion in 
possession of the opposite side could not debar the 
defendant in the suit from carrying out construction or 
improvement in the property unless it was against  any 
specific provision of law. In Muhammad Zahid Pervaiz 
v. Muhammad Shafqat Iqbal (PLD 2007 Lah. 377) it 
was observed to the effect that injunctive order could 
not be lightly granted regarding the construction of the 
property by the vendee nor could making of 
improvement in the property could be restrained till the 
final decision of the case. Even if the preemptor has the 
prima facie case has established its right of preemption 
on record still the owner of property cannot be put 
under restraint to use his property which may 
tantamount to the breach of his fundamental right as 
enshrined by Article 23 of the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic Of Pakistan, 1973. In Muhammad Ashraf v. 
Naseer Ahmad and and others (2010  YLR  22) it was 
observed to the effect that the plaintiff in a suit for 
preemption, at best, is claimant of right of preemption 

W.P. No.9656 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
-5- 
 
 
and has yet to prove his case who cannot be allowed to 
hold a bona fide purchaser  hostage by the reason of 
such claim and deprive such purchaser of the lawful 
right to use and enjoy the property purchased by him. In 
Muhammad Zaman v. Azmat Ullah and another (2014 
MLD 1585) it was observed that the right of preemption 
would not be affected in the case of transfer of property 
or any change in the nature of the same after institution 
of suit and that at best the plaintiff could be directed to 
move an application for spot inspection if any 
construction was made in order to assess whether the 
improvement was made or otherwise qua the time of 
such improvement. In Professor Syed Khurshid Alam v. 
Ch. Muhammad Aslam (2014 CLC 188) it was 
observed that in a suit for preemption if an application  
under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2, C.P.C.  is filed by 
the preemptor to restrain the vendee from alienating the 
suit property or changing the character thereof during 
the pendency of suit, the balance of convenience  could 
not be said to allow in favour of the plaintiff before 
proving the superior right and  performance of talbs  on 
the basis of evidence and that question of prima facie 
case in favour of the plaintiff will be determined after 
scanning of evidence of parties and that the principle of 
lis pendens would take care of the alienation of the suit 
land by the vendee during the pendency of the suit and 
that any injunctive order would deprive  the vendee of 
his vested right to use the land as its owner according to 
his own choice.   
7. 
It is clear from the above that the consistent view 
of the court has been that at the instance of preemptor 
who is yet to succeed after proving talbs and qualifying 
of superior rights, a bona fide purchaser/owner of the 
property could not be restrained from constructing 

W.P. No.9656 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
-6- 
 
 
thereupon or be prevented from using the property for 
own purpose as they choose and that any restraint 
would be violative of the fundamental rights that have 
been guaranteed by the Constitution Of Islamic 
Republic Of Pakistan, 1973. In the present case the 
respondents have specifically stated in the reply to 
application under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. 
that they had already raised the construction detailed 
therein and were using it for commercial purpose while 
the petitioner was unable to show or prove anything 
otherwise. Being so, the application was based on 
frivolous assertions, the petitioner therefore had no 
prima facie case for the grant of injunctive relief while 
the balance of convenience and irreparable loss 
operated in favour of respondents. The courts below for 
valid reasons and on sound premises exercised their 
discretion against the petitioner which does not suffer 
any legal infirmity, jurisdictional error or arbitrariness 
and, therefore, does not call for any interference. 
Resultantly, instant petition is without any substance is 
hereby dismissed.
