Raheel Kamran J:- In this civil revision, the 
petitioners have assailed the order dated 17.07.2023 passed by the 
District Judge, Pakpattan whereby application moved by them for 
withdrawal of cases of civil nature mentioned therein from the Court of 
Senior Civil Judge (Family Division), Pakpattan and transfer to the 
Court of Civil Judge or Senior Civil Judge (Civil Division), Pakpattan 
was dismissed. 
2.       Learned counsel for the petitioners contends that civil matters 
have been entrusted to the Judge Family Court without any lawful 
justification.  He maintains that according to section 5 of the Family 
Courts Act, 1964 (‘the Act’) and Part-I of the Schedule to the Act, a 
Judge Family Court is possessed of jurisdiction only to adjudicate 
upon family disputes and unless such power is conferred upon it by 
law, it cannot adjudicate upon other disputes of civil nature.    
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for respondents No.3 & 4 contends 
that sections 12(2) and 15 of the Punjab Civil Courts Ordinance, 1962 

2 
C. R .No.54194 of 2023 
empower the District Judge to entrust a civil case to any Court or 
himself decide it as the District Judge, which imposes no embargo 
whatsoever on entrusting a case to a Civil Judge performing duties as 
Judge Family Court.  In support of his contention, he has placed 
reliance on the case of Mian Umar Ikram-Ul-Haque vs. Dr. Shahida 
Hasnain and another (2016 SCMR 2186). 
4. 
Learned amicus curiae contends that the Family Courts Act, 
1964 does not expressly or by necessary implication restrict a Civil 
Judge designated as the Judge Family Court from exercising its general 
jurisdiction in civil proceedings. She maintains that it is an 
incontrovertible principle of law that Family Courts are Civil Courts.  
Reliance in this regard is placed on the case of Mirza Daud Baig vs. 
Additional District Judge, Gujranwala and others (1987 SCMR 
1161).  According to her, exclusivity of jurisdiction under section 5 of 
the Act is only applicable where a Family Court is entertaining a suit 
under the Act and it is not relevant where a Civil Judge, who has been 
designated as a Judge Family Court, is hearing a civil suit in his or her 
general jurisdiction, therefore, misdescription of designation does not 
have any effect on the legality of the trial, which falls within the 
maxim falsa demonstratio non nocat.  In support of her contention, she 
has placed reliance on the cases of Piao Gul vs. The State (PLD 1960 
Supreme Court (Pak.) 307), Mst. Razia Begum vs. Mst. Sardar 
Begum and others (PLD 1978 Lahore 696) Allah Jiwaya vs. Judge 
Family Court, Ahmadpur Sharquia and another (1990 MLD 239).  
She further contends that the provisions of the Act must be read 
literally by giving the words used therein ordinary, natural and 
grammatical meaning.  The addition and subtraction of a word in a 
statute is not justified except where for the interpretation thereof, the 
principle of reading in or reading down may be pressed into service, 
therefore, since not a single provision of the Act or the rules framed 
thereunder provides that a Civil Judge presiding over a Family Court is 
precluded from entertaining civil suits under its plenary and general 
jurisdiction, therefore, such a restriction cannot be read into the Act as 

3 
C. R .No.54194 of 2023 
per settled principles of statutory interpretation.  Reliance in this regard 
has been placed on the case of Syed Mukhtar Hussain Shah vs. Mst. 
Saba Imtiaz and others (PLD 2011 Supreme Court 260). 
5. 
In rebuttal, learned counsel for the petitioners contends that the 
judgments relied upon by learned counsel for respondents No.3 & 4 as 
also the learned amicus curiae are distinguishable on facts inasmuch as 
there existed a definite nexus between proceedings before the Family 
Court or as the case may be the Rent Tribunal and the suit which was 
transferred to the same whereas no such nexus has been established in 
the instant case.  He maintains that the instant case involves transfer of 
suits for partition, specific performance of the contract and declaration 
in relation to the suit property. He further contends that there exists a 
distinction between transfer and entrustment of cases under section 24 
of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and delegation of powers to 
Judge Family Court under the provisions of sections 12(2) & 15 of the 
Punjab Civil Courts Ordinance, 1962.  He adds that a Judge presiding 
over a Family Court ceases to be a Civil Court for the purpose of Code 
of Civil Procedure, 1908.  In this regard reliance has been placed on 
the case of Mst. Mahpara vs. S. Arshad Mahmood and another (1999 
CLC Lahore 514).  He lastly contends that there are eight seats of 2nd 
Class and six of 1st Class Civil Judges in the concerned District and 
none of those was vacant at the relevant time, therefore, the impugned 
order has been passed on extraneous consideration.

Heard.  Record perused.   
7. 
It is noteworthy that in the scheme of the Constitution of 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (‘the Constitution’) the right of an 
individual to enjoy the protection of law and to be treated in 
accordance with the law has been provided.  Article 4, inter alia, 
ordains that no person shall be prevented from or be hindered in doing 
that which is not prohibited by law; and no person shall be compelled 
to do that which the law does not require him to do. While a person is 
constitutionally guaranteed above freedom, there is no inherent power 
vested in the state organs or authorities to act save for the authority 

4 
C. R .No.54194 of 2023 
conferred by the Constitution and the law and any act done by the state 
functionaries, order passed or direction issued, if not sanctioned by the 
Constitution or the law, is an act without lawful authority1. Besides the 
above general position, there is a specific provision of Article 175(2) in 
the Constitution that embodies fundamental principle governing 
jurisdiction of the courts which mandates that no court shall have any 
jurisdiction save as is or may be conferred on it by the Constitution or 
by or under any law.  There is thus no constitutional or legal 
presumption that in the absence of any restriction placed by law on 
him/her, a Judge Family Court has jurisdiction to adjudicate upon 
disputes of other civil nature rather the presumption is the other way 
round and for a Judge Family Court to exercise such authority, 
jurisdiction must be conferred on him or her by the law.   
8. 
The Act has been promulgated to establish a quasi-judicial 
forum i.e. the Family Court, which can draw and follow its own 
procedure provided such procedure should not be against the principles 
of fair hearing and trial.  The object of the Act is to minimize the 
technicalities and procedural holdups for the purpose of speedy justice 
between the parties in shortest possible time and manner. The Act has 
changed the forum and also altered the method as to how the trial 
under the Act is to be proceeded and case decided.  A bare reading of 
the Act clearly suggests that by willful exclusion of procedure as 
prescribed under the Code, much has been left at the discretion of the 
Family Court to conduct trial in the manner as provided under the Act 
and also to adopt all possible measures and take all such steps, which 
result in achieving the purpose and object of the Act.   
Section 3 of the Act provides for the establishment of one or 
more of Family Courts by the Government in each District in 
consultation with the High Court consisting of District Judge, 
Additional District Judge, Civil Judge.  Section 12A of the Act 
provides a period of six months for disposal of the case from the date

  others (PLD 2007 SC 642) 

5 
C. R .No.54194 of 2023 
of its institution. Through section 17 of the Act, provisions of the Code 
of Civil Procedure, 1908 (except for sections10 & 11)  and Qanun-e-
Shahadat, 1984 have been made inapplicable and the purpose of 
enacting such section was in fact to give effect to the preamble of the 
Act, which provides that it is meant for expeditious settlement and 
disposal of disputes2.  The nature of disputes which can be brought 
before the Family Court for adjudication have been set forth and 
enumerated in Part-I of the Schedule referred to in section 5 of the Act. 
In order to appreciate scope of jurisdiction of the Family Courts, it is 
imperative to have a glance at section 5 of the Act and Part-I of the 
Schedule, which are reproduced hereunder: - 
“5. Jurisdiction. (1)  Subject to provisions of the Muslim Family 
Laws Ordinance, 1961, and the Conciliation Courts Ordinance, 
1961, the Family Courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction to 
entertain, hear and adjudicate upon matters specified in (Part I of 
the Schedule)” 
 
“Schedule (Part I) 
1. Dissolution of marriage (including Khula). 
2. Dower. 
3. Maintenance. 
4. Restitution of conjugal rights. 
5. Custody children (and the visitation rights of parents to meet 
them.) 
6. Guardianship. 
7. Jactitation of marriage. 
8. Dowry. 
9. Personal Property and belongings of a wife. 
10. Any other matter arising out of the Nikahnama” 
 
9. 
It is abundantly clear from section 5 of the Act that it confers 
exclusive jurisdiction upon the Family Court to entertain, hear and 
adjudicate upon matters specified in Part-I of the Schedule.  On 
account of exclusive jurisdiction of the Family Courts over family 
disputes, Civil Courts, which are the courts of inherent and plenary 
jurisdiction competent to adjudicate upon all disputes of civil nature 
except the suits of which their cognizance is barred either expressly or

6 
C. R .No.54194 of 2023 
by necessary implication, have no authority to adjudicate upon such 
disputes.  
10. 
Whether a Civil Judge who is presiding over the Family Court 
has authority to adjudicate upon any other dispute of other civil nature 
which falls outside the purview of the Act? is the question involved 
here. Reliance has been placed on the provisions of sections 12(2) and 
15 of the Civil Courts Ordinance, 1962 (‘the Ordinance’) to support the 
impugned order.  
11. 
Undoubtedly, Family Courts fall within one of the classes of 
Civil Courts recognized under section 3 of the Ordinance for having 
been established under the Act, which is in force for the time being. 
The other classes of courts include the Court of District Judge, Court 
of Additional District Judge and the Court of the Civil Judge3. Section 
7 of the Ordinance confers unlimited pecuniary jurisdiction of the 
District Judges in original civil suits, except as otherwise provided in 
any enactment for the time being in force, whereas section 9 of the 
Ordinance empowers the High Court to determine and classify 
pecuniary jurisdiction of civil judges in original civil suits. Likewise, 
provisions of sections 5, 6 and 10 of the Ordinance, inter alia, govern 
territorial jurisdiction of District Judges, Additional District Judges and  
Civil Judges.  
12. 
Since counsels have heavily relied on the provisions of sections 
12(2) & 15 of the Ordinance, it would be advantageous to reproduce 
the same for clarity: - 
“12.    Exercise by Civil Judges of Jurisdiction of District Courts 
in certain proceedings.– (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in 
the Succession Act, 1925, the High Court may, by general or 
special order, authorise any Civil Judge to take cognizance of or 
any District Judge to transfer to a Civil Judge under his control, 
any proceedings or class of proceedings under the said Act. 
      (2)  The District Judge may withdraw any such proceedings 
taken cognizance of by or transferred to a Civil Judge, and may 
either himself dispose of them or transfer them to a Court under his 
control competent to dispose of them: 
                                                 
3 Section 3 of the Ordinance 

7 
C. R .No.54194 of 2023 
      Provided that nothing herein contained shall empower a 
District Judge to withdraw such proceedings as have been 
specifically transferred from his Court by the High Court. 
      (3)  …..” 
 
“15.    Power to distribute business.– Notwithstanding anything 
contained in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, every District 
Judge may by written order direct that any civil business cognizable 
by his Court and the Courts under his control shall be distributed 
among such Courts in such manner as he thinks fit: 
      Provided that no direction issued under this section shall 
empower any Court to exercise any powers or deal with any 
business beyond the limits of its jurisdiction.” 
 
Section 12(2) of the Ordinance empowers a District Judge to withdraw 
any proceedings taken cognizance of by or transferred to a Civil Judge 
to either himself dispose of the same or transfer to a Court under his 
control competent to dispose it of, with the exception that no power of 
withdrawal is available to the District Judge in relation to such 
proceedings as have been transferred from his Court by the High 
Court. It is thus apparent that the power of the District Judge under 
section 12(2) ibid is limited in its scope to transfer proceedings only to 
such a Court as would be competent to dispose it of.  Section 15 of the 
Ordinance empowers the District Judge to distribute civil business 
cognizable by his Court and the Courts under his control by written 
order, in such manner as he thinks fit, however, it may be emphasized 
that proviso to the said section mandates that no direction issued under 
that section could empower any Court to exercise any powers or deal 
with any business beyond the limits of its jurisdiction.  
It is thus abundantly clear that be it the power of withdrawal 
and transfer under section 12 of the Ordinance or the power to 
distribute business under section 15 of the Ordinance, no authority is 
vested in the District Judge to entrust any matter to and empower a 
Civil Judge to adjudicate upon any civil claim beyond the limits of its 
jurisdiction, in particular over the subject matters covered by special 
enactments.  
13. 
There is thus no provision in the Punjab Civil Courts 
Ordinance, 1962 or the Family Courts Act, 1964 or the rules made 

8 
C. R .No.54194 of 2023 
thereunder which confers authority upon the Family Courts to 
adjudicate upon civil disputes other than those specified in Part-I of the 
Schedule to the Act. See section 14 of the Ordinance.    
14. 
Article 203 of the Constitution envisages that each High Court 
shall supervise and control all courts subordinate to it with the object to 
establish orderly, honorable, upright, impartial and legally correct 
administration of justice.  The supervision and control over the 
subordinate judiciary vested in the High Courts under Article 203 of 
the Constitution is exclusive in nature, comprehensive in extent and 
effective in operation4.  Moreover, section 14 of the Ordinance 
stipulates that Civil Courts in the area to which the Ordinance extends 
shall be subordinate to the High Court, and, subject to the general 
superintendence and control of the High Court, the District Judge shall 
have control over all Civil Courts within the local limits of his 
jurisdiction.  The above provisions, however, do not take away or 
restrict authority of this Court to empower Judges of the Family Court 
to additionally exercise powers of the Civil Courts if so notified.  But 
in the instant case, learned counsel for respondents No.3 & 4 has not 
been able to refer to any such power conferred upon the Judge Family 
Court.  
15. 
Without prejudice to the foregoing, assuming for the sake of 
argument that a discretion is available with the District Judge to 
transfer any civil suit to the Family Court even though subject matter 
thereof does not fall within the scope of the Act, would it be proper 
exercise to allow such a transfer? The answer may well be in negative. 
The Family Court cannot ordinarily hear the civil suits for such Courts 
have been established for expeditious settlement and disposal of 
disputes regarding marriage and family affairs and the matters 
connected therewith. Except for the disputes having unavoidable  
nexus with the disputes being adjudicated by the Family Court which, 
if at all could be referred to the Civil Judge presiding over the Family 
Court, it would be clearly improper exercise of discretion on part of the 
                                                 
4 Sh. Liaqat Hussain and others v. Federation of Pakistan & others (PLD 1999 SC 504) 

9 
C. R .No.54194 of 2023 
District Judge to entrust any ordinary civil dispute to the Family Court 
having no nexus whatsoever with any pending family case.  In forming 
such opinion, this Court is additionally fortified by the consideration of 
effective administration of justice inasmuch as efficiency of the Family 
Courts, which are required to proceed expeditiously with the matters 
without strictly adhering to the rules of procedure and evidence 
embodied in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and Qanun-e-Shahadat 
1984, would be undermined if made to adjudicate upon ordinary civil 
disputes where the above enactments are required to be applied.   
16. 
In the instant case, the reason that prevailed with the District 
Judge was that there was shortage of judicial officers in the District 
Pakpattan, as three Civil Judges were transferred without substitute 
whereas according to the petitioners’ counsel there was no such 
shortage in the said District.  The office was, therefore, directed to 
apprise this Court of the sanctioned strength of Judicial Officers and 
that of working in the District Pakpattan, according to which, 
sanctioned strength of the Civil Judges and Senior Civil Judges was 
nineteen whereas eight of them were posted there.  Although total 
strength of the Civil Judges was not available at the concerned District, 
however, for the reasons stated above, it was not appropriate that those 
civil cases which had no nexus with any pending family dispute should 
be entrusted to the Family Court. 
17. 
The precedents relied upon by learned counsel for respondents 
No.3 & 4 as well as learned amicus curiae are not relevant and the 
same are distinguishable on facts.  In the case of Mian Umar Ikram-Ul-
Haque (supra), one party had filed an eviction petition whereas the 
other had filed suit for specific performance of the contract and the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan had ordered that both the matters be tried 
by the same Court. In the case of Syed Mukhtar Hussain Shah (supra) 
referred to by the learned amicus curiae, the question related to 
jurisdiction of the Family Court over a claim for recovery of an amount 
on the basis of entry in Nikahnama as well as a condition in an 
agreement between the parties (ex-spouses) and there were two 

10 
C. R .No.54194 of 2023 
divergent judgments of this Court on interpretation of entry No.9 of 
Part-I of the Schedule to the Act, which conflict was resolved by the 
Supreme Court declaring lack of jurisdiction of the Family Courts in 
holding that the said entry did not include any amount which was not 
yet property of the wife but she only had a claim to recover from the 
husband while adhering to the literal rule of statutory interpretation.  In 
fact that judgment supports the view that what does not fall within the 
jurisdiction of the Family Court could not be adjudicated upon by it. 
18. 
For the foregoing reasons, this civil revision is allowed and 
while setting aside the impugned order dated 17.07.2023, the District 
Judge, Pakpattan is directed to transfer cases, subject matter of the 
application, to any of the Civil Judges competent to adjudicate upon 
the same who ordinarily is seized of civil matters in accordance with 
law.
