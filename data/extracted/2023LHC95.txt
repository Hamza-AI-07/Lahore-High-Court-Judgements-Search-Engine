Writ Petition No. 11512 of 2019 
(Arshad Mehmood v. Judge Family Court and another) 
 
JUDGMENT 
 
Date of hearing: 
 
24.01.2023 
 
Petitioner by: 
Mr. Humayun Syed Rasool, Advocate.  
 
Respondents by: 
Nemo.  
 
 
 
 
Faisal Zaman Khan, J.  Through this petition, 
interim orders dated 27.10.2018 and 20.06.2019 passed by respondent 
no.1 have been assailed. By virtue of the former order, right of the 
petitioner to cross-examine the witnesses of respondent no.2 has been 
struck off and through the latter, his right to produce oral as well as 
documentary evidence has also been closed.  
 
2. 
 
At the outset of hearing, learned counsel for the petitioner 
has been confronted with section 14 of the West Pakistan Family Courts 
Act 1964 (Act) to highlight that the Legislature in its own wisdom has 
not provided any appeal or revision against an interim order passed by 
the Family Court, therefore, this writ petition is not maintainable in view 
of the fact that if any such jurisdiction is exercised by this Court, the 
same would amount to defeating the intention of the Legislature. 
 
3. 
 
In spite of his earnest effort, learned counsel for the 
petitioner has not been able to give any plausible explanation.

4. 
 
Despite service and representation, none has entered 
appearance on behalf of respondent no.2 therefore she is proceeded 
against ex parte  
 
5. 
 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
 
6. 
 
The moot point which requires determination by this Court 
is as to whether against an interim order passed by a Family Court, a 
writ petition is maintainable?  
 
7. 
 
Family courts are established under section 3 of the West 
Pakistan Family Courts Act 1964 (Act). The said courts exercise their 
jurisdiction under section 5 of the Act, which is restricted to the 
“matters” specified in Part I of the Schedule of the Act. 
 
8. 
  
The preamble of the Act would show that the Act has been 
promulgated in order to make provisions for establishment of family 
courts for expeditious settlement and disposal of disputes relating to 
marriage and family affairs and for matters connected therewith.  
 
9. 
 
A careful reading of the preamble would show that the Act 
has primarily been promulgated for “expeditious” “settlement” and 
“disposal of disputes” mentioned in the Schedule of the Act which 
primarily cater for the disputes arising out of “marriage”, which is 
between the “spouses” and the “family affairs” which are outcome of 
marriage. 
 
10. 
 
When an “issue/dispute/matter” as contemplated in the 
Schedule arises to a spouse, for “disposal” of the same either of them 
under section 6 of the Act being an aggrieved spouse will approach the 
family court against a party as defined in section 2(d) of the Act, whose 
presence is necessary for proper decision of the case or which has been 

 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 11512/2019

impleaded by the family court. Upon such institution, defendant shall be 
intimated under section 8 who upon intimation will file a written 
statement under section 9 whereafter under section 10 process of 
“settlement” will be initiated by the family court by making an effort 
for reconciliation between the spouses. If the reconciliation fails, issues 
will be framed and thereupon under section 11 parties will be put to 
evidence and once the evidence is concluded, under section 12 another 
effort for “settlement” between the spouses shall be made by the family 
court and in case it fails, a final decree will be passed. 
 
11. 
 
Unlike the procedure provided for proceeding in a regular 
civil suit under the Code of Civil Procedure 1898 (CPC), for 
“expeditious” disposal of the family suits, under section 7 an aggrieved 
spouse is allowed to enjoin multifarious causes of action (as mentioned 
in the Schedule) in one suit and for disposal of the same section 12-A 
provides for a time line. To further simplify the process/procedure and 
for express disposal of cases, under section 17 application of Qanun-e-
Shahdat Order 1984 and CPC has also been ousted. 
 
12. 
 
In order to meet the objectives of the Act a bar has been 
specifically created in section 14(3) of the Act which would show that 
any interim order passed by the Family Court cannot be subject to 
challenge through an appeal or a civil revision.  
 
13. 
 
While interpreting such like bar of jurisdiction, it has been 
held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan that where a particular 
law does not provide a remedy against an interim order passed by a court 
exercising jurisdiction under that law, the said order ordinarily cannot be 
assailed by way of filing a constitutional petition with a caveat that if the 
order is without jurisdiction. For reference, reliance can be placed on 
judgments reported as President, All Pakistan Women Association, 
Peshawar Cantt. v. Muhammad Akbar Awan and others [2020 SCMR 

 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 11512/2019

260], Allah Rakha (deceased) through L.Rs. and others v. Additional 
Commissioner (Revenue), Gujranwala and others [2020 SCMR 502] 
and Haji Muhammad Latif v. Muhammad Sharif and others [2021 
SCMR 1430].  
 
14. 
 
Keeping the above in view, when an interim order passed 
by a family court is challenged before this Court in exercise of its 
Constitutional Jurisdiction (which according to the judgments mentioned 
supra is circumscribed), interference made by this Court would not only 
amount to challenging the wisdom/intention of the Legislature, who has 
deliberately not provided any remedy against the interim order passed by 
the family court but it is also violative of Article 189 of the Constitution 
of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Even otherwise, such interference 
will also be defeating the purpose of promulgation of the Act qua 
expeditious disposal of the family cases.  
 
15. 
 
It has also been held by the Hon’ble Apex Court that 
wisdom/intention of the Legislature cannot be looked into by this Court 
in exercise of its constitutional jurisdiction. For reference, reliance can 
be placed on judgments reported as Zaman Cement Company (Pvt.) Ltd. 
v. Central Board of Revenue and others [2002 SCMR 312], Pakistan 
Lawyers Forum and others v. Federation of Pakistan and others [PLD 
2005 SC 719], State of M.P. v. Rakesh Kohli and another [2013 SCMR 
34] and Lahore Development Authority through D.-G. and others v. Ms. 
Imrana Tiwana and others [2015 SCMR 1739].  
 
16. 
 
Keeping in view the above and placing it in juxtaposition 
with the facts of the present case, it is clear and obvious that respondent 
no.1 through the impugned interim orders has not only taken away the 
right of the petitioner to cross-examine the witnesses of respondent no.2 
but has also closed his right to produce oral as well as documentary 
evidence. The said orders being interim in nature could not have been 

 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 11512/2019 
 
 
 
5
assailed in an appeal or civil revision as contemplated in section 14 of 
the Act and since the learned counsel for the petitioner has failed to 
show any jurisdictional defect in the said orders, the jurisdiction of this 
Court is also barred.  
 
17. 
 
It shall not be out of place to mention here that many 
opportunities were granted to the petitioner to produce his evidence 
which also included last opportunity however he failed to do the needful 
therefore the impugned orders have rightly been passed as they are in 
consonance with the principle of law laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in judgment reported as Moon Enterprises CNG 
Station Rawalpindi v. Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited and another 
[2020 SCMR 300].  
 
18. 
 
For what has been discussed above, since the learned 
counsel for the petitioner has not been able to highlight any 
jurisdictional defect or procedural impropriety in the impugned orders, 
therefore, no interference is required, as a  sequel to which, this petition 
fails and the same is dismissed.
