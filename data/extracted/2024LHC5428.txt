MIRZA VIQAS RAUF, J. This single judgment shall 
proceed to decide the fate of instant petition (W.P.No.3168 of 2022) 
as well as Writ Petitions No.3169 & 3170 of 2022) on account of

BRIEF FACTS: 
2.  
The petitioner namely Muhammad Munir, claiming himself to 
be landlord of Shops No.2, 42 and 43 forming part of property, 
bearing No.W-318 in the name and style of Taj Mahal Market, 
situated in Nankari Bazar, Rawalpindi (hereinafter referred to as 
“premises in question”), moved three separate applications under 
Section 19 of The Punjab Rented Premises Act, 2009 (hereinafter 
referred to as “Act, 2009”), seeking eviction of the private 
respondents herein (hereinafter referred to as “respondents”), before 
the learned Special Judge (Rent), Rawalpindi, inter alia, on the 

W.Ps.NO.3168, 3169 & 3170 OF 2022  
-2- 
grounds that there was an oral tenancy and the respondents, being 
tenants, were though bound to vacate the premises in question in 
case of personal bona fide need of the petitioner but they refused to 
do so; that the respondents have committed default in payment of 
rent and that the respondents have damaged the premises in 
question. In order to resist the ejectment proceedings, respondents 
submitted their respective applications for leave to contest, wherein 
they denied the existence of relationship of landlord and tenant and 
instead pleaded that premises in question are part of Waqf and they 
were initially tenant of Haji Imam Din and after his death, affairs of 
the trust are managed by Haji Mehr Din, who is their landlord and 
receiving the rent. Leave to contest was allowed to the respondents 
whereafter necessary issues were framed and ultimately after 
recording of evidence, ejectment applications were accepted vide 
order dated 11th April, 2022. Feeling dissatisfied, the respondents 
preferred their respective appeals before the learned Additional 
District Judge, Rawalpindi. The appeals were allowed by way of 
separate judgments dated 19th September, 2022 and resultantly, the 
ejectment applications were dismissed hence, these petitions under 
Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973.  
ARGUMENTS: 
3.  
Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that though 
overwhelming evidence was produced by the petitioner to establish 
that there exists relationship of landlord and tenant between the 
parties but it has been discarded by the appellate court in an illegal 
and unlawful manner. It is argued with vehemence that initially, the 
learned Special Judge (Rent) allowed the ejectment applications 
through well-reasoned orders but same have been set at naught by 
the appellate court without assigning any lawful reasoning. Learned 
counsel emphasized that the stance taken by the respondents in their 
applications for leave to contest was contradictory and as such, the 
appellate court committed illegality while allowing the appeals. 

W.Ps.NO.3168, 3169 & 3170 OF 2022  
-3- 
While making reference to Section 2(e) of The Punjab Waqf 
Properties Ordinance, 1979 (hereinafter referred to as “Ordinance”), 
learned counsel emphasized that Waqf was invalid and there was no 
hurdle in alienating the premises in question in favour of the 
petitioner. Learned counsel contended that in view of sale deed 
executed in favour of the petitioner, he became owner of the 
premises in question. Learned counsel submitted that the impugned 
judgment is not tenable in the circumstances. 
4.  
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondents submitted 
that originally the premises in question were owned by Haji Imam 
Din, who executed a Waqf-deed in the form of waqf (وقف علےالیہ). It 
is added that after execution of the Waqf-deed, the original owner 
practically parted his proprietary rights. He added that after 
execution of Waqf-deed, premises in question could not be further 
alienated and as such, the petitioner is neither owner nor landlord of 
the premises in question. It is emphatically contended by learned 
counsel for the respondents that the learned Special Judge (Rent) 
committed illegality while passing the eviction orders, which have 
rightly been set-aside by the appellate court. In order to supplement 
his contentions, learned counsel placed reliance on KHALID JAVED 
and others versus Qazi MASOOD-UR-REHMAN, ADDITIONAL 
DISTRICT AND SESSIONS JUDGE, SIALKOT and 2 others (PLD 
1988 Lahore 541), HAFEEZULLAH BAIG through his Legal Heirs 
and others versus Mst. NAHEED JALIL (1996 C L C 663) and 
FARAZ AHMAD BHUTTA versus ADDITIONAL DISTRICT 
JUDGE and others (PLD 2011 Lahore 483). 
POINT FOR DETERMINATION: 
• Whether there exists relationship of landlord and tenant 
interse petitioner and respondents?  
FINDINGS: 
5.  
It is an admitted position that premises in question alongwith 
other commercial property were originally owned by Haji Imam Din, 

W.Ps.NO.3168, 3169 & 3170 OF 2022  
-4- 
grandfather of the petitioner, who executed Waqf-deed bearing 
No.2094 (Exh.R-93). By virtue of said Waqf-deed, Haji Imam Din 
dedicated the properties mentioned therein alongwith premises in 
question for waqf (وقف علےالیہ). The petitioner claiming himself as 
owner of the premises in question, on the basis of sale deeds, moved 
applications for eviction of the respondents. On filing of ejectment 
applications by the petitioner under the “Act, 2009”, respondents 
submitted their respective applications for leave to contest in terms 
of Section 22 of the “Act, 2009” wherein they denied the relationship 
with the petitioner with the stance that the premises in question 
were dedicated as waqf (وقف علےالیہ) by original owner Haji Imam 
Din through Waqf-deed by appointing himself as trustee during his 
lifetime and reserving right to give rent of the premises in question 
to any deserving institute. It is also asserted in the applications of 
leave to contest that in the Waqf-deed, an embargo was placed on 
further alienation of the premises in question. It evinces from the 
record that initially leave was declined to the respondents by learned 
Special Judge (Rent) and eviction order was passed on 26th July, 
2016, which was assailed by the respondents through separate 
appeals before learned Additional District Judge, Rawalpindi. The 
appeals were consolidated and vide judgment dated 17th March, 
2017, handed down by learned Additional District Judge, 
Rawalpindi, all the appeals were allowed; leave was thus granted to 
the respondents and matter was remanded to the learned Special 
Judge (Rent), Rawalpindi with the direction to decide it afresh after 
recording evidence of the parties. In post-remand proceedings, the 
ejectment applications were accepted by way of order dated 11th 
April, 2022 but the appellate court set-aside the eviction order 
through the impugned judgment dated 19th September, 2022. 
6.  
The moot point, which requires determination is restricted to 
existence of relationship of landlord and tenant interse the petitioner 
and the respondents to which effect issue was also framed and 
parties produced their respective evidence pro and contra to the core 

W.Ps.NO.3168, 3169 & 3170 OF 2022  
-5- 
issue. Before adverting to any other aspect of the matter, it would be 
advantageous to observe that “Act, 2009” was promulgated to 
regulate relationship of landlord and tenant in respect of rented 
premises and to provide mechanism for settlement of disputes interse 
landlord and tenant in an expeditious and cost-effective manner and 
for connected matters therewith. It is thus imperative for the 
applicant invoking provisions of the “Act, 2009”, seeking eviction of 
a person arraying him as respondent in the application, to first 
establish relationship, being landlord and tenant. Section 2 (d) of the 
“Act, 2009” defines “landlord” as under:- 
 
 
“2.  
Definitions. – In this Act:-- 
 
 
(a)  
---------------- 
 
 
(b) 
---------------- 
 
 
(c)  
---------------- 
(d) 
“Landlord” means the owner of premises and 
includes a person for the time being entitled or 
authorized to receive rent in respect of the premises;” 
On the other hand, “tenant” is defined in Section 2(l) in the following 
manner:- 
“2.  
Definitions. – In this Act:-- 
 
 
  
---------------- 
 
 
 
---------------- 
 
 
  
---------------- 
(l) 
“Tenant” means a person who undertakes or is bound 
to pay rent as consideration for the occupation of a 
premises by him or by any other person on his behalf 
and includes: 
(i)  
a person who continues to be in occupation of 
the premises after the termination of his 
tenancy for the purpose of a proceeding under 
this Act; 
(ii)  
legal heirs of a tenant in the event of death of 
the tenant who continue to be in occupation of 
the premises; and 

W.Ps.NO.3168, 3169 & 3170 OF 2022  
-6- 
(iii) 
a sub-tenant who is in possession of the 
premises or part thereof with the written 
consent of the landlord;” 
7.  
Needless to mention that for determining the relationship 
interse the parties to the ejectment application, one has to keep in 
mind both the above noted provisions which can neither be separated 
nor read in isolation to each other while proceeding with the 
ejectment application. Thus, for setting the law into motion under the 
“Act, 2009”, the applicant has to demonstrate that he is owner of the 
premises or he is the person who is, for the time being, entitled or 
authorized to receive rent in respect of the premises. Simultaneously, 
a respondent in the ejectment application would only qualify to be 
called as tenant if he undertakes or bound to pay rent as consideration 
for occupation of a premises by him or by any other person on his 
behalf, including his legal heirs on account of death. It also includes 
sub-tenant, who occupies the premises or part thereof with written 
consent of the landlord. 
8.  
In the above backdrop, when case at hand is examined, it is 
noticed that in view of respective claims of both the sides, Waqf-deed 
(Exh.R-93) becomes of great import. Perusal of Waqf-deed reveals 
that the original owner specifically dedicated premises in question 
as well as rent derived therefrom for waqf (وقف علےالیہ) to be paid to 
the deserving institution. It is pre-condition in the Waqf-deed that 
premises in question as well as other properties, mentioned therein 
would not be subject to further alienation.  
9. 
Adverting to the contention of learned counsel for the 
petitioner that by virtue of Section 2(e) of the “Ordinance”, 
Waqf-deed is invalid and sale deed executed by the father of the 
petitioner Haji Mehr Din in his name is valid one and equips him 
with the right to seek eviction of the respondents being landlord; 
suffice to observe that Section 2(e) of the “Ordinance” has been 
misconstrued by the learned counsel. As already observed that a 
specific clog was imposed in the Waqf-deed on using the premises 

W.Ps.NO.3168, 3169 & 3170 OF 2022  
-7- 
in question for the personal benefit of legal heirs so Section 2(e) of 
the “Ordinance” would not come to rescue the petitioner. 
10.  
Waqf means the permanent dedication by a person professing 
Islam of any property for any purpose recognized by the Muslim as 
religious, pious or charitable. Waqf is always of permanent character. 
In the case of FARAZ AHMAD BHUTTA versus ADDITIONAL 
DISTRICT JUDGE and others (PLD 2011 Lahore 483), this Court 
while dealing with a similar proposition held as under:- 
“9. So far as the first contention of the learned counsel for the 
petitioner that a Rent Controller cannot look into the title of the 
landlord is concerned, this Court does not find itself in agreement 
with such contention. In section 2(c) of the Ordinance (ibid) the 
definition of landlord has been given which says that any person 
for the time being entitled to receive rent in respect of any building 
or rented land. The word "entitled" means the legal entitlement of 
a person; such person has to prove that he has legally', been 
authorized to collect the rent or he is collecting the rent on his own 
account. In the instant case, the petitioner did not produce any 
evidence showing that they were authorized by Haji Nawab-ud-Din 
and others to collect rent on their behalf from the tenants of the 
property. The petitioner has solely relied upon the sale-deed 
executed by Haji Nawab-ud Din and others in their favour 
alienating the property in favour of the petitioners. So the learned 
Rent Tribunal in this situation has to examine whether the 
petitioners are lawful owners and the property transferred in their 
favour was transferred by lawfull means or that they have been 
legally authorized for the collection of the rent from the tenants, No 
doubt, the learned Rent Controller is not supposed to conduct 
detailed inquiry into the fact, but in order to satisfy itself, Rent 
Controller has to examine these facts before assuming jurisdiction 
under Rent Laws. Both the courts below while examining these 
factual positions have rightly held that the petitioners are not the 
lawful transferee of the property in dispute for the reason that 
Shahab-ud Din had created the Waqf of the property prohibiting 
the alienation. 
  
10. In order to examine the creation of Waqf, the principle laid 
down by D.F. Mulla in this respect are to be considered. According 
to section 173 of Muhammadan Law, a Waqf is a permanent 
dedication by a person professing the Muslim faith of any property, 
recognized by the Muslim Law as religious, pious or charitable. 
Section 174 of the Muhammadan Law directs a waqf to make a 
permanent waqif without limiting the period while the object of the 
Waqf has been described in 178 mentioning that it should be for 
religious, pious and writable purposes and Waqf could be in favour 
of settlor's family, children and descendants. 
  

W.Ps.NO.3168, 3169 & 3170 OF 2022  
-8- 
11. Doctrine of press has been laid down in section 181 and the 
creation of Waqf by inter vivos or testamentary has been provided 
in sections 184 and 185. To complete a testamentary waqf, section 
186 provides the procedure. Section 189 of Muhammadan Law 
clearly provides that testamentary waqf can be revoked any time 
before the death of the waqif meaning thereby the other waqif's 
are not revocable. Further section 193 provides that Waqf property 
cannot be alienated t except in the case mentioned in sections 207 
and 208 which sections provide the powers of Mutawali to sell or 
mortgage of the Waqf property with the 'permission of the court or 
if such power has been given expressly in the Waqf deed. The 
purpose of mentioning all these sections is to ascertain the 
intention of late Haji Shahab-ud Din from Waqf deed available at 
page 88. of this constitutional petition which was also produced 
before the trial Court and was marked as Exh.R.233. If this deed 
is kept in view, created as far as back on 2-1-1931 and further deed 
executed in 1935 by said Shahab-ud-Din, shows that it was made 
as a permanent dedication for charitable and pious purposes 
mentioned therein and subsequently restraining the successive 
Mutawalis' from alienation of the whole property or any part 
thereof. It was mentioned at page 13 of the waqf-deed that:- 
 
 
In clause 5 of the said deed at page 15, the right to sell the property 
was prohibited in the following words:-- 
 
 
 
 
It is further elaborated in clause 8 that 
 
 
 The charitable purpose is also explicit from the wording of this 
waqf deed i.e. the waqif wanted to establish a school for the 
children. This is besides other charitable purpose which he 
intended to establish in his life time. The reading of these different 
clauses of the waqf-deed clearly established the intention of the 
waqif and prohibition from the alienation in future. The submission 
of the learned counsel for the petitioner that on 26-11-1946, said 
Shahab-ud-Din himself cancelled the Waqf through a registered 
document, therefore, it would be deemed that property was never 
bequeathed by Shahab-ud-Din through waqf-deed; This 
submission of the counsel in view of the afore-noted wording has 
no legs to stand for the reason that when the property did not vest 
in the waqif and the possession has been delivered to Allah 

W.Ps.NO.3168, 3169 & 3170 OF 2022  
-9- 
Almighty then he has left with no authority to cancel it. The waqf-
deed is found to be very comprehensive document which was 
allegedly revoked by the waqif through instruments appearing at 
page 166 of this petition, in which the waqif cancel the waqf-deed 
in the shallow words:-- 
 
 
This is very funny statement made by the waqif. When it is 
compared with the original waqf-deed, it appears to be very casual 
and shallow statement because the waqf-deed was executed by 
Shahab-ud-Din with the help of his special attorney Malik Jalal-ud 
Din, B.A., LL.B. Pleader, Sialkot thus, the excuse that in 1946 he 
got a legal advice that the document executed previously did not 
fulfil the requirements of Waqf appears to be an attempt to wriggle 
out the waqf-deed for which the waqif had no authority at all.” 
  
 Reference to the above effect can also be made to KHALID JAVED 
and others versus Qazi MASOOD-UR-REHMAN, ADDITIONAL 
DISTRICT AND SESSIONS JUDGE, SIALKOT and 2 others (PLD 
1988 Lahore 541) and HAFEEZULLAH BAIG through his Legal 
Heirs and others versus Mst. NAHEED JALIL (1996 C L C 663).  
11.  
There is yet another important aspect, the petitioner while 
appearing as AW.1, in specific words, deposed as under:- 
 
The above noted extract from the statement of the petitioner leaves 
no room to hold that the petitioner has badly failed to prove his status 
as landlord of the premises in question. In other words, when the 
petitioner did not succeed in establishing that he is landlord of the 
premises in question, he is precluded to move an application, 
seeking eviction of the respondents under the “Act, 2009”. 

W.Ps.NO.3168, 3169 & 3170 OF 2022  
-10- 
12.  
The nutshell of above discussion is that there exists no 
relationship of landlord and tenant between the petitioner and the 
respondents. Eviction order was thus patently illegal and the 
appellate court was fully justified to set-aside the eviction order, 
passed by learned Special Judge (Rent), Rawalpindi through the 
impugned judgment, which is unexceptionable. Resultantly, this and 
connected petitions are dismissed, with no order as to costs.
