Mirza Viqas Rauf, J. This appeal under section 24 of the 
Cantonments Rent Restriction Act, 1963 (hereinafter referred to as “Act, 
1963”) arises out of order dated 15th January, 2020, whereby the Rent 
Controller, Wah Cantonment proceeded to allow the ejectment petition 
filed by the respondents seeking eviction of the appellant from shop No.2 
forming part of property No.B-80, Lalarukh Wah Cantt (hereinafter 
referred to as “rented premises”). 
2.  
The facts forming background of this appeal are that the 
respondents, claiming themselves to be landlords of the “rented premises”, 
filed an ejectment petition under section 17 of the “Act, 1963” seeking 
eviction of the appellant on the grounds of personal bonafide need and 
damage to the “rented premises”. The ejectment petition was resisted by 
the appellant on multiple grounds, including denial of relationship of 
landlord and tenant. From the divergent pleadings of the parties, the Rent 
Controller framed multiple issues and then proceeded to record evidence 
of both the sides. On completion of evidence, ejectment petition was 
accepted conditionally by way of order dated 15th January, 2020, which is 
now impugned in this appeal. 
3.  
Learned counsel for the appellant contended that no cogent 
evidence was though produced by the respondents to show that the “rented

premises” are required for their personal use but the ejectment petition has 
been accepted in an illegal and unlawful manner. It is added that the Rent 
Controller did not properly appreciate the evidence of the parties while 
allowing the ejectment petition. Learned counsel emphasized that the 
impugned order is not tenable under the law. 
4.  
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondents seriously 
resisted this appeal and defended the eviction order. 
5.  
Heard. Record perused. 
6.  
It appears from the record that initially ejectment petition was 
filed by Muhammad Asif Askari (respondent No.1). The appellant, while 
resisting the ejectment petition, submitted his reply wherein he asserted 
that the “rented premises” were obtained by him from Muhammad Tariq 
Anwar. During the proceedings, an application for impleading of 
Muhammad Tariq Anwar, Najam-ul-Hassan, Mst. Pakar-e-Anwaar and 
Mst. Huma Anwaar was, however, moved on the ground that they are also 
co-owners/landlords of the “rented premises”. The application was 
allowed and they were arrayed as petitioners in the ejectment petition. The 
ejectment petition was, thus, accordingly amended. In the light of 
respective pleadings of the parties, necessary issues were framed by the 
Rent Controller. In support of averments of the petition, respondent No.1 
appeared as AW-1. He reiterated the contents of the ejectment petition and 
stated that he is co-landlord of the “rented premises” and also general 
attorney of his brothers and sisters. It is also stated that the “rented 
premises” are required bonafidely for the personal use of the respondents 
as they have retired from their service. 
7.  
On the contrary, the appellant submitted his affidavit in 
evidence as Exh.R1 and controverted the claim of the respondents. From 
the analysis of the evidence produced by both the sides, there remains no 
cavil to the fact that the respondents have duly established their personal 
bonafide need. The ejectment petition was ultimately allowed by way of 
impugned order.

8.  
Section 17 of the “Act, 1963” lays down the grounds for 
eviction of a tenant from the rented premises. Personal bonafide need is 
one of the recognized grounds for eviction. Sub-section 4 (b) of section 17 
of the “Act, 1963” deals with the ground of personal bonafide need in case 
of commercial building, which reads as under: - 
 
 
 
17. 
Eviction of tenant.- (1)…. 
 
 
 
 
(2)…. 
 
 
 
 
(3)…. 
(4)   
A landlord may apply to the Controller for an order 
directing the tenant to put the landlord in possession,-- 
 
 
 
(a)    
in the case of a residential building, if— 
 
(i)    
he requires it in good faith for his own occupation or 
for the occupation of any member of his family; and 
(ii)   
he or the member of his family, as the case may be, 
is not occupying any other residential building suitable for 
his needs at the time, in the Cantonment Area concerned or 
in any local area in the vicinity thereof; and 
(iii)  
he or the said member has not vacated such a 
building in the said area or vicinity without sufficient cause 
after the commencement of this Act; and 
 
 
 
(b)   in the case of a commercial building, if-- 
(i)    he requires it in good faith for his own use; and 
(ii)   he is not occupying in the Cantonment Area 
concerned or in any local area in the vicinity thereof in 
which such building is situate for the purposes of his 
business any other such building suitable for his needs at 
the time; and 
(iii)  he has not vacated such a building in the said area 
or 
vicinity 
without 
sufficient 
cause 
after 
the 
commencement of this Act: 
 
Provided that where the tenancy is for a specified 
period agreed upon between the landlord and the tenant, the 
landlord shall not be entitled to apply under this sub-section 
before the expiry of such period: 
 
Provided further that when the landlord has 
obtained possession of a residential or a Commercial 
building under the provisions of sub-clause (a) or sub-
clause (b) he shall not be entitled to apply again for the 
possession of any other building under that sub-clause, 
unless the building of which he had previously taken 
possession has become unsuitable for his needs: 

4 
F.A.O No.21 of 2020 
 
 
 
 
            Provided also that this sub-section shall not apply to 
serais, hotels, dak-bungalows, lodging-houses, boarding 
houses, residential clubs, restaurants, eating houses, cafes, 
refreshment rooms and places of public recreation or resort 
or premises dealing in sales or production of materials of 
books of educational and cultural values except where the 
landlord requires any such building to carry on any such 
business of his own, in which case he may make an 
application under this sub-section after having served two 
years notice on the tenant; but no building which is not on 
the commencement of this Act, being used for any of the 
aforesaid purposes, or has not after such commencement 
been let out expressly for any such purpose, shall be 
converted to any such purpose except with the consent in 
writing of the landlord. 
   
        (Underlining supplied for emphasis) 
9.  
It is an oft repeated principle of law that whenever a landlord 
pleads that the “rented premises” are required to him for his personal 
need bonafidely, assertion on oath by the landlord that he requires the 
property in good faith for his personal use shall be sufficient to accept his 
bonafides if such assertions are consistent and in conformity with the 
averments of the ejectment petition. Such statement cannot be discarded in 
vacuum. Even otherwise, it is always the landlord, who is vested with the 
prerogative to exercise his choice for the “rented premises” and if he 
needs it bonafidely for his personal use, his claim cannot be rejected 
outrightly.  
10.  
It would not be out of place to mention here that in terms of sub-
section (5) of section 17 of the “Act, 1963”, the Controller shall, if he is 
satisfied that the claim of the landlord under sub-section (4) is bona fide 
make an order directing the tenant to put the landlord in possession of the 
building on such date as may be specified by the Controller and if the 
Controller is not satisfied, he shall make an order rejecting the application 
provided that the Controller may give the tenant a reasonable time for 
putting the landlord in possession of the building and may extend such time 
so as not to exceed three months in aggregate. To this effect, sub-section 6 
of section 17 of the “Act, 1963” cannot be ignored, which ordains that 
where the landlord who has obtained possession of a building in pursuance 
of an order made under sub-section (5) does not himself, or where 

5 
F.A.O No.21 of 2020 
 
 
 
 
possession of the building has been obtained for any member of his family, 
such member does not occupy the building within one month of the date of 
obtaining its possession, the tenant who had been evicted may apply to the 
Controller for an order directing that the possession of such building be 
restored to him and the Controller may thereon make an order 
accordingly. The above provision clearly safeguards the rights of the 
tenant. Guidance in this regard can be sought from PAKISTAN INSTITUTE 
OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS versus NAVEED MERCHANT and others (2012 
SCMR 1498).  
11.  
It is also well entrenched principle that if landlord canvasses 
multiple grounds for the eviction of the tenant it is not necessary for him to 
establish and prove all these grounds. If the landlord is able to prove one 
of the grounds asserted in the ejectment petition, the tenant can be evicted 
by the Rent Tribunal. Reliance in this respect can be placed on Major 
(Retd.) AHSAN-UL-HAQUE versus MUHAMMAD EJAZ (2011 SCMR 
487). The relevant extract from the said judgment is reproduce below:- 
 “11. It is on record, having been claimed and declared by 
the petitioner that he was employed with the Canadian 
Embassy as the Trade Commissioner for the last twenty 
years and that he was to retire on 18-8-2006. The exception 
taken by the two Courts that he had not alleged in the 
ejectment petition that the petitioner was in service and was 
about to retire and that it was only while under cross-
examination that he had given the details of the kind of 
employment in which he was engaged and the time on 
which he was likely to retire, was misplaced. There is no 
legal requirement that a party must offer all the details 
through the pleadings as long as the relevant and necessary 
jurisdictional fact had been stated and asserted through 
such pleadings. The petitioner had submitted through his 
ejectment petition that he required the premises in question 
in good faith for his personal need and if the details thereof 
had come on record only through the courtesy of the cross-
examiner then the opposite party deserved to thank their 
own counsel for it and the petitioner could not be punished 
for the same. As far as the record before the Court is 
concerned it did stand asserted on record that petitioner had 
been working as the Trade Commissioner in the Canadian 
Embassy for the last twenty years; that he was to retire on 
18-8-2006 i.e. within about a year of the filing of the 
ejectment petition and that he intended to establish a 
Trading House in the premises in question. Through whose 
courtesy the said material had come on record was not 
relevant as long as the said material was available on 

6 
F.A.O No.21 of 2020 
 
 
 
 
record. It may be added that the claim of the petitioner that 
he wanted to set up a Trading House was perfectly 
reasonable and acceptable as he had had the experience in 
the field having worked with a foreign mission as its Trade 
Commissioner for twenty long years. 
12. Both the learned Courts including the High Court failed 
to appreciate that having so claimed about his service and 
about the date of retirement, the onus placed on petitioner 
stood more than sufficiently discharged and it was then for 
the respondent to show that such a claim made by the 
petitioner about his retirement was false. No such attempt 
had been made by the respondent. The impression with the 
High Court that once the petitioner had declared that he 
was to retire on 18-8-2006 and since the proceedings had 
remained pending in the trial Court till April, 2009, the fact 
that no attempt was made by the petitioner to produce any 
document to establish that the petitioner did in fact retire on 
18-8-2006 was an extraneous consideration especially 
when not even a suggestion had been made to him during 
the cross-examination that his said claim of his date of 
retirement was false.” 
12.  
It is noticed that while moving the ejectment petition, the 
respondents canvassed that the “rented premises” were in fact meant for 
the residential purpose and on account of its conversion into commercial 
activity, a notice was served by the Cantonment Board Wah Cantt for 
unauthorized commercial use. In this backdrop, the Rent Controller while 
allowing the ejectment petition, imposed a condition that the respondents 
shall never use the “rented premises” un-authorisedly for commercial 
purpose until it is converted into commercial status after due process of 
law. It was also observed that in case the “rented premises” is again put to 
un-authorised commercial use, the Cantt Board Wah shall take legal action 
against the respondents in the light of order dated 24th October, 2017 
passed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan and if the respondents get the 
“rented premises” commercialized in future, they will be bound to make 
their first offer to the appellant. The condition imposed by the Rent 
Controller is thus quite logical and in the interest of appellant. 
13.  
In the wake of above discussion, I am of the considered view 
that the appellant has failed to point out any illegality or material 
irregularity in the impugned order. Resultantly, this appeal fails and is 

7

dismissed with no order as to costs. Office to remit the record of Rent 
Controller, Wah Cantt accordingly.
