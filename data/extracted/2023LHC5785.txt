JUDGMENT 
 
Date of hearing 
 
 
       5.10.2023 
For the Appellant: 
Syed Zeeshan Haider, Advocate, with the 
Appellant 
For the State: 
Mr. Najeeb Ullah Khan Jatoi, Deputy 
Prosecutor General. 
 
 
 
Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – This appeal is directed against 
the judgment dated 26.3.2021 handed down by the Additional Sessions 
Judge, Chishtian, in case FIR No. 518/2020 dated 12.10.2020 registered 
at Police Station Bakhshan Khan, District Bahawalnagar, for an offence 
under section 9(c) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997  
(the “Act”). 
2. 
 
Brief facts of the case are that on 12.10.2020, Muhammad 
Afzal/ASI (PW-2) was present in the area of Bakhshan Khan with other 
police officials when he received spy information that a drug peddler 
named Ijaz Hussain, also known as Jajay Shah (the Appellant), was seen 
at the Sheli Gharbi-wala Bridge carrying a huge quantity of charas. The 
source indicated that immediate action could lead to the Appellant’s 
arrest. The Complainant and his team responded quickly to the tip-off 
and apprehended the Appellant at the specified location. The 
Complainant inspected the plastic bag that the Appellant was carrying 
and found 1210 grams of charas in it. He extracted 61 grams from it and 
prepared a sealed sample parcel for chemical analysis. Then, he secured 
the remaining charas P-1 in a separate sealed parcel and took both these 
parcels into his possession vide the Recovery Memo Exh. PB. 
Thereafter, the Complainant drafted the complaint Exh. PC, and sent it 

Crl. Appeal No.214/2021

to the Police Station Bakhshan Khan, District Bahawalnagar, through 
Sagheer Ahmad 287/C where FIR No.518/2020 Exh. PC/1 was 
registered. Following the completion of the investigation, a report under 
section 173 Cr.P.C. was submitted. 
3. 
 
On 18.11.2020, the Additional Sessions Judge framed 
charge against the Appellant to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed 
trial. On its conclusion, vide judgment dated 26.3.2021, he convicted 
him under section 9(c) of the Act and sentenced him to rigorous 
imprisonment for four years and six months with a fine of Rs.20,000/- 
and, in default thereof, to undergo simple imprisonment for a further 
period of five months. The benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. was 
extended to him. This appeal stems from that judgment. 
4. 
 
In support of this appeal, Syed Zeeshan Haider, Advocate, 
contended that the Appellant was innocent and the police had concocted 
this case against him. According to him, no raid was conducted and the 
alleged contraband was not found in the Appellant’s possession. Mr 
Haider cited various passages from the testimony of the prosecution 
witnesses to support his contention. He argued that the trial court had 
erred in appraising the evidence, which had resulted in a serious 
miscarriage of justice. 
5. 
 
The Deputy Prosecutor General vehemently opposed this 
appeal. He contended that the prosecution had established its case 
convincingly, leaving no room for doubt. He argued that the prosecution 
case was supported by Muhammad Afzal/ASI (PW-2) and Muhammad 
Adnan 441/C (PW-3) and the forensic report Exh. PG. He maintained 
that the prosecution evidence was trustworthy and the contradictions, if 
any, were minor and inconsequential. The Deputy Prosecutor General 
prayed for the dismissal of this appeal. 
6. 
 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
7. 
 
The prosecution case is that on 12.10.2020, the Appellant 
was apprehended at the Sheli Gharbi-wala Bridge and 1210 grams of 
charas were recovered from him. It examined Muhammad Afzal/ASI 
(PW-2) and Muhammad Adnan 441/C (PW-3) to prove that recovery. 
They deposed in line with the complaint Exh. PC and the FIR Exh. PC/1, 

Crl. Appeal No.214/2021

and supported each other on all critical details, such as the date, time, 
place, and the method of the recovery. However, some aspects of this 
case raise concerns. 
8. 
 
As noted above, the prosecution claims that Muhammad 
Afzal/ASI led the operation based on the information from a spy. 
However, nothing on the record suggests that he accompanied the police 
force to the Sheli Gharbi-wala Bridge. There is also no evidence that any 
member of the raiding party knew the Appellant previously. In these 
circumstances, the prosecution was bound to explain how PW 
Muhammad 
Afzal/ASI 
recognized 
him. 
This 
explanation 
is 
conspicuously missing. 
9. 
 
According to PWs Muhammad Afzal/ASI (PW-2) and 
Muhammad Adnan 441/C (PW-3), as well as the Investigating Officer, 
Waqas Jamil/SI (PW-4), two officials of Eagle Squad No.13 also joined 
the raid. They were important witnesses to the occurrence and could 
have added to the credibility of the prosecution case, but their statements 
under section 161 Cr.P.C. were not recorded. Importantly, not even their 
names were mentioned in any proceedings. 
10. 
 
The law does not expressly forbid the complainant/raiding 
officer from investigating narcotics cases, though it is not appreciable. In 
the present case, two different officers conducted the raid and the 
investigation. Muhammad Afzal/ASI (PW-2) led the police team during 
the raid, seized the contraband charas, and reported the crime through 
complaint Exh. PC. On the other hand, Waqas Jamil/SI (PW-4) 
investigated the case. Given this situation, Muhammad Afzal/ASI was 
responsible for preparing the Recovery Memo Exh. PB, and lodging the 
complaint Exh.PC, while Waqas Jamil/SI should have done all the other 
proceedings.  
11. 
 
A recovery memorandum is the fundamental document in 
cases involving narcotics. In Zafar Khan and another v. The State 
(2022 SCMR 864), the Supreme Court of Pakistan outlined its 
importance and emphasized that the Seizing Officer should draft it 
carefully, ensuring that it includes a comprehensive inventory of the 
items recovered. This document must be executed in the presence of two 
or more credible witnesses, who are then required to endorse it with their 

Crl. Appeal No.214/2021 
 
- 4 - 
signatures. The primary objective of drawing the recovery memorandum 
on the spot, with the signatures of such witnesses, is to ensure that the 
recovery process is carried out transparently and with integrity, reducing 
the possibility of false allegations or evidence tampering. Once the 
recovery memorandum is prepared, the next step for the prosecution is to 
produce the same before the trial court, to prove the recovery of the 
material and the memo’s preparation through the scribe and the marginal 
witnesses. 
12. 
 
Both Complainant Muhammad Afzal/ASI (PW-2) and 
Muhammad Adnan 441/C (PW-3) admitted in their cross-examinations 
that the handwriting on complaint Exh. PC, Recovery Memo Exh. PB, 
rough site plan Exh. PE and the statements of witnesses recorded under 
section 161 Cr.P.C. was the same. The Investigating Officer, Waqas 
Jamil/SI (PW-4), tried to save the situation by stating that the 
handwriting on these documents was different. On this, the Appellant’s 
counsel requested the trial court to examine these documents upon which 
it found that they were in the same hand.  
13. 
 
The Deputy Prosecutor General objected strongly to the 
trial court comparing the handwriting on the above-mentioned 
documents, arguing that it should have referred them to the forensic 
expert. We are not inclined to agree with him in the circumstances of the 
present case and because of the admissions of PWs Muhammad Afzal 
and Muhammad Adnan. Besides, in Khudadad v. Syed Ghazanfar Ali 
Shah alias S. Inaam Hussain and others (2022 SCMR 933), the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan held: 
“It is true that it is undesirable that a Presiding Officer of the court 
should take upon himself the task of comparing signature in order 
to find out whether the signature/writing in the disputed document 
resembled that of the admitted signature/writing but Article 84 of 
Qanun-e-Shahadat 1984 does empower the court to compare the 
disputed signature/writing with the admitted or proved writing1 … 
The court has all the essential powers to conduct an exercise of 
comparing the handwriting or signature to get hold of a proper 
conclusion as to the genuineness of handwriting or signature to 
effectively resolve the bone of contention between the parties. The 
real analysis is to ruminate the general character of the 
inscriptions/signatures for comparison and not to scrutinize the 
configuration of each individual letter. It is an unadorned duty of 
the court to compare the writings in order to reach at precise 
                                          
1 In this context, the Supreme Court referred to (i) Ghulam Rasool and others v. Sardar-ul-Hassan 
and another (1997 SCMR 976); (ii) Mst. Ummatul Waheed and others v. Mst. Nasira Kausar and 
others (1985 SCMR 214) and (iii) Messrs Waqas Enterprises and others v. Allied Bank of Pakistan 
and others (1999 SCMR 85).

conclusion, but this should be done with extreme care and caution 
and from dissimilarity and discrepancy of two signatures, court 
may legitimately draw inference that one of these signatures is not 
genuine and when the court is satisfied that the signature is forged 
and feigned then nothing prevents the court from pronouncing 
decisions against the said documents.” 
14. 
 
In Ikram Ullah v. The State and others (2017 YLR 712), 
one of the grounds that weighed with the Islamabad High Court to acquit 
an accused in a narcotics case was that the Recovery Memo and the 
complaint were in the handwriting of two different persons rather than 
one. Similarly, in Mst. Marvi Bhatti v. The State (2018 MLD 1329), the 
Sindh High Court ruled against the prosecution because the handwriting 
on the Memo of Arrest and Seizure did not match the Mashirnama of the 
Place of Incident. During cross-examination, a witness attempted to 
explain this difference by citing variations in the type of pen used, but 
the court rejected his explanation. Again, in Aslam Khan v. The State  
(2021 PCr.LJ 1018), based on the contents of the documents, including 
the recovery memorandum and the statements of prosecution witnesses, 
it was initially claimed that the Seizing Officer prepared these 
documents. However, during the trial, at the defence counsel’s request, 
the Seizing Officer’s handwriting was obtained and placed on the record. 
Upon comparing the Seizing Officer’s handwriting with the 
aforementioned documents, it was revealed that they were dissimilar. 
The court concluded that the Seizing Officer did not draft these 
documents, which was considered one of the grounds for the accused’s 
acquittal. 
15. 
 
The facts and circumstances of the present case indicate that 
the same person prepared the entire file in a single sitting. It is hard to 
reject the Appellant’s contention that it was at the police station and that 
no raid was ever conducted. 
16. 
 
It is a cardinal principle of criminal law that the burden of 
proof rests squarely on the prosecution, and it is obligated to prove the 
charge against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. This canon is 
firmly grounded in the presumption of innocence, which dictates that an 
accused person is regarded as innocent until proven guilty. In the United 
States, the concept that the prosecution must prove the accused 
defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is deeply ingrained in the 

Crl. Appeal No.214/2021 
 
- 6 - 
Constitution. The Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees 
the right to a fair trial, and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth 
Amendment extends this right to the states. Numerous rulings by the 
U.S. Supreme Court have underscored the significance of this principle. 
One of the most renowned cases exemplifying it is In re Winship, 
397 U.S. 358 (1970). In this case, the Supreme Court held that the 
prosecution must prove every element of a criminal offence beyond a 
reasonable doubt rather than by a preponderance of the evidence or some 
lesser standard. Justice Harlan, writing for the majority, stated that  
“the reasonable-doubt standard is indispensable, for it ‘impresses on the 
trier of fact the necessity of reaching a subjective state of certitude of the 
facts in issue.’ ”  
17. 
 
In the United Kingdom, Woolmington v. The Director of 
Public Prosecutions, [1935] AC 462, is one of the important cases in 
which the House of Lords reaffirmed the presumption of innocence and 
held that it is the prosecution’s duty to prove the guilt of the accused 
beyond a reasonable doubt. Lord Sankey famously stated, “Throughout 
the web of the English criminal law, one golden thread is always to be 
seen, that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the prisoner's guilt 
subject to what I have already said as to the defence of insanity and 
subject also to any statutory exception.” 
18. 
 
In R. v. Lifchus, 1997 CanLII 319 (SCC), [1997] 3 SCR 
320, the Supreme Court of Canada stated: 
“The phrase ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’, is composed of words 
which are commonly used in everyday speech. Yet, these words have 
a specific meaning in the legal context. This special meaning of the 
words ‘reasonable doubt’ may not correspond precisely to the 
meaning ordinarily attributed to them. In criminal proceedings, where 
the liberty of the subject is at stake, it is of fundamental importance 
that jurors fully understand the nature of the burden of proof that the 
law requires them to apply. An explanation of the meaning of proof 
beyond a reasonable doubt is an essential element of the instructions 
that must be given to a jury. That a definition is necessary can be 
readily deduced from the frequency with which juries ask for 
guidance with regard to its meaning. It is therefore essential that the 
trial judge provide the jury with an explanation of the expression ... 
Perhaps a brief summary of what the definition should and should not 
contain may be helpful. It should be explained that: 
• the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is 
inextricably intertwined with that principle fundamental to all 
criminal trials, the presumption of innocence; 
• the burden of proof rests on the prosecution throughout the 
trial and never shifts to the accused; 

Crl. Appeal No.214/2021 
 
- 7 - 
• a reasonable doubt is not a doubt based upon sympathy or 
prejudice; 
• rather, it is based upon reason and common sense; 
• it is logically connected to the evidence or absence of 
evidence; 
• it does not involve proof to an absolute certainty; it is not 
proof beyond any doubt nor is it an imaginary or frivolous 
doubt; and 
• more is required than proof that the accused is probably  
guilty – a jury which concludes only that the accused is 
probably guilty must acquit.” 
19. 
 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan has ruled in several cases 
that there does not need to be a plathora of circumstances raising doubt. 
Even a single event that creates reasonable doubt in the mind of a 
prudent person regarding an accused’s guilt would entitle him to 
acquittal as a matter of right, not grace. Reference in this regard may be 
usefully made to the following cases: Tariq Pervez v. The State  
(1995 SCMR 1345), Riaz Masih alias Mithoo v. The State (1995 SCMR 
1730), Muhammad Akram v. The State (2009 SCMR 230), and  
Hashim Qasim and another v. The State (2017 SCMR 986). 
20. 
 
Having reappraised the evidence, we hold that the 
prosecution has failed to prove its case against the Appellant beyond 
any reasonable doubt. Hence, we accept Crl. Appeal No.214/2021, set 
aside the conviction and sentence awarded to the Appellant and acquit 
him of the charge. The Appellant is on bail as his sentence was 
suspended by this Court vide order dated 12.8.2021. His surety stands 
discharged.
