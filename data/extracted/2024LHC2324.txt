JUDGMENT 
Date of Hearing: 
08.05.2024 
Petitioner By: 
Mr. Maqbool Hussain Sheikh, Advocate  
Respondents By: 
Mr. Sikandar Nisar Saroya, A.A.G. 
Assisted by: 
Sher Hassan Pervez, Research Officer 
 
ABID HUSSAIN CHATTHA, J: The Petitioner was constrained to institute 
the titled Petition when he was denied provision of certified copies of RL-II No. 
26 and 46 by the functionaries of the Board of Revenue, Punjab. Resort by the 
Petitioner to the Punjab Transparency and Right to Information Act, 2013 (the 
“Information Act”) for this purpose also remained a futile exercise. 
Accordingly, the Petitioner seeks a direction to the Respondents for acceptance 
of his request qua issuance of relevant extracts of certified copies of Form RL-II 
Register.   
 2. 
 
Learned Law Officer has relied upon detailed reply of the 
Respondents to argue that officials of the Board of Revenue, Punjab are 
lawfully empowered to deny issuance of certified copies of RL-II. It is stated 
that historically, Registers in RL-II Form were prepared and maintained 
with respect to allotment and disposal of agricultural lands to displaced 
persons who had migrated from India to Pakistan by way of settlement 
schemes through which permanent rights over the lands were conferred on 
claimants under the provisions of the Displaced Persons (Land Settlement) 
Act, 1958 (the “Settlement Act”). The basic settlement scheme was 
introduced 
under 
the 
Pakistan 
Rehabilitation 
Act, 
1956 
(the 

2 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 55591 / 2022 
 
“Rehabilitation Act”) known as the West Pakistan Rehabilitation 
Settlement Scheme (the “Scheme”) in order to allot agricultural lands after 
verification of claims. Registers in RL-II Form were prepared containing 
various entries pertaining to the claims, particulars of land and 
measurement, etc. The process of preparing such Registers entailed 
verifications, objections of claimants, proposals and final allotments. Para 
Nos. 60 and 63 of the Scheme provided for supply of copies of entries of 
RL-II to the claimants and upon finalization of process, Registers were 
prepared in Form RL-II under Para 70 of the Scheme. As such, the 
settlement Authorities were performing acts and maintaining record 
including RL-II Registers under the applicable settlement laws and 
settlement schemes prescribed thereunder. Accordingly, inspection of 
record and supply of copies of RL-II to the allottees conferring rights to 
them or displaced persons were regulated by law and governing provisions 
of the settlement schemes. Therefore, the question of issuing certified copy 
of RL-II is liable to be considered in light of the applicable settlement laws 
and the settlement schemes.  
3. 
 
In the Year 1973, the Chief Settlement & Rehabilitation 
Commissioner, Punjab in pursuance of the decision of Federal 
Government, ordered to stop allotment of rural evacuee agricultural land 
and in this regard, communicated necessary instructions to all relevant 
Commissioners / revenue officers in Punjab vide letter No. 2319-73/2022-
R(L) dated 25.06.1973. Through this letter, it was directed, inter alia, that 
all RL-II Registers in the field be consigned with the relevant 
Commissioners under their personal custody. It was further directed that 
the last entry of each Register be signed and thereafter sealed. 
4. 
 
The aforesaid decision was followed by the enactment of the 
Evacuee Property and Displaced Persons Laws (Repeal) Act, 1975 (the 
"Repeal Act"), whereby, various laws relating to rehabilitation and 
settlement conferring powers of allotment of evacuee property were 
repealed w.e.f. 01.07.1974. Under Section 2(2) of the Repeal Act, all 
pending proceedings stood transferred for final disposal to the officers 
notified by the Government. All assets, liabilities and properties available 

3 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 55591 / 2022 
 
for disposal in terms of the Repeal Act stood transferred to the Board of 
Revenue, Punjab. Moreover, as per Section 4 thereof, all work regarding 
documentation of properties also stood transferred to the Board of 
Revenue, Punjab. 
5. 
 
Following the Repeal Act, another memorandum bearing No. 
1524/75/854-R(L) dated 19.06.1978 was issued to all relevant 
Commissioners / revenue officers to communicate instructions of the Chief 
Settlement Commissioner / Member, Board of Revenue (Settlement & 
Rehabilitation), Punjab. It was directed that any allotment which has not 
been incorporated in the revenue record before coming into force of the 
Repeal Act or within one year of passing of allotment order (whichever is 
later) may be deemed to have been fraudulently obtained by ante-dating the 
entries in RL-II Registers and should be cancelled forthwith. 
6. 
 
Subsequently, the Member, Board of Revenue, Punjab issued 
letter No. 3595-84/2398-51 dated 12.12.1984, whereby, it was noted that 
after the Repeal Act all confirmed khatas in RL-II Registers have already 
been mutated and ultimately incorporated in the regular Registers with 
relevant entries in Haqdaran-e-Zamin, etc., therefore, RL-II Registers have 
lost their importance as a public document. Moreover, since RL-II 
Registers had remained in the custody of revenue officers, junior to the 
relevant Commissioners for an extended period, there was a very real 
possibility that entries in RL-Il Registers might have been interpolated and 
tempered extensively. In these circumstances, all Deputy Commissioners 
were directed to advise the Assistant Commissioners under their 
jurisdiction to discourage the issuance of copies of RL-II Registers. 
However, on the requisition of a directly interested party, the whole 
Register could be produced in original by a duly authorized official as and 
when required, if relevant copies are required for production in a Court of 
law. 
7. 
 
The Repeal Act has recently been amended to the extent of the 
Province of Punjab through enactment of the Evacuee Property and 
Displaced Persons Laws (Repeal) (Amendment) Act, 2022 (the 
"Amendment Act"). Accordingly, the jurisdiction qua all pending 

4 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 55591 / 2022 
 
proceedings before the notified officer / Chief Settlement Commissioner 
under Section 2(2) of the Repeal Act has been taken away w.e.f. 
26.09.2022 and exclusively vested with the Full Board consisting of three 
Members of the Board of Revenue, Punjab constituted by the Senior 
Member, Board of Revenue, Punjab from time to time. 
8. 
 
Since the jurisdiction with respect to all settlement matters 
under the Repeal Act as amended through the Amendment Act vests only 
with the Full Board, the matter regarding provision of certified copies to 
the Petitioner was placed before the Full Board headed by the Senior 
Member, Board of Revenue, Punjab in its meeting held on 13.01.2023 
under Agenda Item No. 3 which was examined and accordingly rejected. 
9. 
 
In compliance with the Order dated 04.10.2023 passed by this 
Court, the Senior Member, Board of Revenue, Punjab on 02.01.2024, 
constituted a six-member committee to review the matter regarding 
provision of copies of RL-II Register with specific terms of reference i.e. 
(i) under which provision of law, certified copies of RL-II Register are 
being refused to the Petitioner; and (ii) what are the reasons and 
background for such refusal. The committee held its meeting on 
17.01.2024 and it was unanimously decided through recorded minutes of 
meeting that since the RL-II Registers are sealed and an archived record 
owing to the past practices of tempering and interpolation, therefore, 
opening of sealed RL-II Registers runs the risk of further tempering and 
manipulations. As such, sealed RL-II Registers can neither be opened nor 
certified copies thereof be issued under the law for the reasons that the 
applicable settlement laws stand repealed and after enactment of the 
Amendment Act, the limited jurisdiction of inquiry with respect to the 
settlement matters exclusively vests with the Full Board of Revenue which 
can open the record in connection with an inquiry and / or allow the sealed 
record to be produced before the Superior Courts in sealed form upon 
requisition. 
10. 
 
Similarly, the Board of Revenue, Punjab vide letters dated 
24.07.2023 and 15.06.2013, has issued necessary instructions, as also 
conveyed to Deputy Commissioner, Narowal through letter dated 

5 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 55591 / 2022 
 
08.01.2024 that upon repeal of settlement laws, the scope of dealing with 
specific pending matters relating to settlement is very limited and only in 
cases falling within that limited scope, the record of RL-II Registers can be 
de-sealed subject to approval and issuance of certified copies thereof is not 
permissible. The said instructions include the instructions as regards the 
implementation of decrees of Civil Courts in the light of Judgments of the 
Superior Courts and production of sealed record in the Courts. 
11. 
 
Therefore, the provisions of law encapsulated in the Repeal 
Act as amended by the Amendment Act and the instructions / policies 
issued thereunder from time to time do not permit issuance of certified 
copy of RL-II Registers, rather, the same put a clog thereon any further as 
the status of RL-II Registers is no more that of a public document. After 
analyzing the entire scheme of law, the committee concluded that since 
RL-II Registers have been archived having been sealed and kept under lock 
since 1973, therefore, they no longer constitute public record. As such, the 
practice of their use and issuance of certified copies was conscientiously 
replaced with production of the entire original sealed record in a Court of 
competent jurisdiction, if so required. The policy directives were lawfully 
and validly issued by the competent authorities at the relevant times and 
have remained in the field for decades since their issuance. Hence, the 
jurisdiction to de-seal RL-II Registers now exclusively vests with the Full 
Board which has lawfully considered and regretted the request of the 
Petitioner regarding issuance of certified copy of RL-II Registers under the 
Repeal Act as amended through the Amendment Act and on the basis of 
the policy directives which have been in force for over half a century. 
12. 
 
Public documents are defined and prescribed in Article 85 of 
the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (the “QSO”). In terms of Article 87 
thereof, certified copies of public documents are issued in the prescribed 
manner to any person having right to inspect the same. RL-II Registers 
conferring rights on the claimants were prepared and maintained under the 
governing settlement laws and settlement schemes. Hence, the same fell in 
the category of „public documents‟ under Article 85(4) of the QSO which 
were required to be maintained under the law. Upon repeal of the 

6 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 55591 / 2022 
 
settlement laws through the Repeal Act read with the Amendment Act, the 
preparation and maintenance of RL-II Registers stood abolished. The 
powers and authorization of the settlement Authorities under the Repeal 
Act read with the Amendment Act with respect to settlement matters and 
maintenance of record also stood revoked. The outcome and culminating 
effect of the entries contained in RL-II Registers have now become past 
and closed transactions since confirmed allotments have been duly 
incorporated or mutated in the regular Registers or revenue record in shape 
of confirmed Khatas. At the same time, the previously maintained record 
of RL-II Registers has also been sealed in order to avoid any future misuse, 
interpolation or manipulation. Therefore, the RL-II Registers being not 
maintained any more under the law, do not constitute public documents 
under Article 85(4) of the QSO. Hence, issuance of any certified copy of 
RL-II Registers by the Respondents is neither mandated nor permissible 
under the law. 
13. 
 
Under the provisions of the Repeal Act read with the 
Amendment Act, conferring of rights over an agricultural evacuee land by 
way of settlement has come to an absolute end and there exists no legally 
enforceable right to settlement. Even the pending proceedings under 
Settlement Act stand abated under Section 2-B of the Repeal Act as 
inserted through the Amendment Act. The proviso thereto permits 
continuation of only those proceedings which involve cancellation of 
adjustment, allotment or utilization of land made against pending claims 
after 01.07.1974 and jurisdiction in relation to the same can only be 
exercised by Full Board of the Board of Revenue, Punjab. Hence, in the 
absence of any legal right as to the RL-II Registers and inspection thereof, 
the Petitioner cannot seek issuance of certified copy thereof under the law. 
It is submitted, without conceding in any manner, that even if the Petitioner 
is entitled to be treated in accordance within the exceptions provided in the 
Repeal Act read with the Amendment Act, the relevant RL-II Registers 
may be de-sealed during the course of inquiry by the Full Board of the 
Board of Revenue, Punjab in exercise of its limited jurisdiction under the 
law and / or the record may be produced in sealed form before any Court of 

7 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 55591 / 2022 
 
law having jurisdiction in this regard. However, in any case, a certified 
copy of RL-II Registers, conferring settlement right on Petitioner, cannot 
be issued to him, at present, under the governing law. Therefore, in the 
circumstances when RL-II Registers do not constitute public document and 
the Petitioner has no right to inspect the same upon abolishing of such 
right, this Petition seeking direction from this Court in this regard is liable 
to be dismissed. 
14. 
 
Given the scheme of law as explained above, in the absence of 
any proceedings pending with respect to any entitlement of the Petitioner 
within the limited exceptions under the Repeal Act as amended through the 
Amendment Act, the Petitioner has no locus standi to institute this Petition. 
Besides absence of any legal right of the Petitioner to get certified copy of 
RL-Il Registers and corresponding legal obligation of the Respondents in 
this regard, he is not entitled for any discretionary relief as he has not come 
to the Court with clean hands. Notwithstanding the exceptions as to any 
proceedings relating to the settlement, there are no proceedings of any kind 
which are pending with respect to any claim and entitlement of the 
Petitioner. If there were proceedings initiated or pending, the sealed record 
could be inspected by the competent authority or produced before any 
Court of law in the sealed form. However, the Petitioner is trying to get a 
certified copy of a document conferring right or entitlement on him under 
the garb of public document which is unwarranted in law. Hence, this 
Petition is liable to be dismissed on this score alone. 
15. 
 
This Petition is also hit by the availability of an efficacious 
alternate remedy to the Petitioner. As explained above, the grievance and 
right or entitlement of the Petitioner, if any, without conceding, can be 
addressed during the course of any proceedings within the legal exceptions 
under the law i.e. the Repeal Act read with the Amendment Act as the 
relevant RL-II Registers may be de-sealed or inspected by the competent 
authority or any Court of law in connection with the inquiry or any 
proceedings. The inspection of sealed record for the purposes of any 
inquiry or judicial determination is distinct and different from an 
independent right of seeking issuance of certified copy of RL-II Registers. 

8 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 55591 / 2022 
 
Hence, the Petitioner has an alternate remedy for his grievance, if any, and 
the titled Petition is not maintainable. 
16. 
 
The moot point involved in this Petition is as to whether Forms 
in RL-II Registers constitute public record or not and whether certified 
copies thereof can be lawfully refused by the Respondents?   
17. 
 
The State of Pakistan after its creation embarked upon a 
strenuous and arduous journey to settle and rehabilitate refugees who had 
migrated from India. In the process various settlement laws were 
promulgated and settlement schemes were prescribed thereunder to achieve 
the objective. Agricultural evacuee lands were, accordingly, allotted to 
entitled persons against verified claims. The basic Scheme was introduced 
under the Rehabilitation Act. Comprehensive mechanism was put in place 
under the Scheme entailing various steps ranging from receipt and 
verification of claims, receiving and determination of objections, raising of 
proposals and conferring allotments on provisional basis culminating into 
permanent allotments. Various Registers in Forms were prescribed to 
incorporate various entries corresponding to multiple phases in the 
allotment process. Para 60-61 of the Scheme prescribed the Register in 
Form RL-I (Appendix III) for recording of entries of receipt of verified 
claims, receipt and disposal of objections in relation to Fard-i-Haqiat. Para 
63 of the Scheme prescribed Form of RL-II (Appendix V) called the 
Provisional Permanent Allotment Register for recording of verified claims 
and details of allotment and disposal of agricultural lands to displaced 
persons. Column 10 thereof relates to area permanently allotted with index 
units. Para 63 read with Para 60 of the Scheme also confers the right of 
inspection to obtain certified copies of extracts of RL-I and II Registers as 
per Para 3.48(1), Note 2 and 3.48(3) of the Land Records Manual. Para 63 
declares that entries in RL-II Registers form the basic record of the 
rehabilitation settlement work. As such, ownership rights were conferred 
upon the allottees. Therefore, the entries contained in Form RL-II Registers 
constitute the basis of title with respect to allotted agricultural lands under 
settlement 
laws 
and 
settlement 
schemes 
prescribed 
thereunder, 
notwithstanding that such entries had been recorded, incorporated or 

9 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 55591 / 2022 
 
mutated in subsequent revenue record in relevant registers which is being 
maintained regularly. 
18. 
 
The Repeal Act came into effect on 01.07.1974. Section 2 of 
the Repeal Act repealed the Registration of Claims (Displaced Persons) Act 
1956; the Rehabilitation Act; the Pakistan (Administration of Evacuee 
Property) Act, 1957; the Displaced Persons (Compensation and 
Rehabilitation) Act, 1958; the Settlement Act; the Scrutiny of Claims 
(Evacuee Property) Regulation, 1961; and the Price of Evacuee Property 
and Public Dues (Recovery) Regulation, 1971. Section 2(2) of the Repeal 
Act transferred all pending proceedings before the Authorities or cases 
remanded by the Superior Courts to notified officers which were required 
to be decided in accordance with the provisions of the repealed Acts and 
Regulations under Section 2(1) thereof as mandated by Section 2(3) 
thereof. The obligation of execution of final orders was placed upon the 
Board of Revenue under Section 2(4) of the Repeal Act in accordance with 
the provisions of the said repealed Acts and Regulations. After the 
devolution of powers under the Constitution (Eighteenth Amendment) Act, 
2010, the Repeal Act which was in Federal ambit was adapted with certain 
amendments by the Province of the Punjab through the Evacuee Property 
and Displaced Persons Laws (Repeal) (Amendment) Act, 2012. Later, 
further amendments were introduced in the Repeal Act through the 
Amendment Act. Accordingly, the pending proceedings and remanded 
cases from the Superior Courts were transferred from the notified officers 
to the Full Board of the Board of Revenue, Punjab which were required to 
be decided in accordance with the provisions of the said repealed Acts and 
Regulations. Conspicuously, Sections 2-A and 2-B were inserted in the 
Repeal Act by the Amendment Act. Section 2-A of the Amendment Act 
provides that all properties allotted after the repeal of the Acts and 
Regulations mentioned in Section 2(1) of the Repeal Act shall be subject to 
scrutiny at any time, and after observing due process of law, if it is found 
that any land or property was allotted in contravention of any law or 
through fraud, forgery or misrepresentation, such allotment shall be 
cancelled. Further, Section 2-B of the Amendment Act provides that all 

10 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 55591 / 2022 
 
proceedings before the commencement of the Repeal Act in relation to 
adjustment, allotment or utilization of former evacuee land against verified 
claims of produce index units of claimants before notified officers shall 
stand abated provided that such proceedings in relation to adjustment, 
allotment or utilization of land made against pending claims of produce 
index units after 01.07.1974 in contravention of law shall not stand abated 
and shall  be decided in accordance with law. Under Sections 3 and 4 of the 
Repeal Act as amended through the Amendment Act, all properties 
available for disposal before the repeal of the Acts and Regulations under 
Section 2(1) thereof or which may become available for disposal after such 
repeal due to cancellation of any fraudulent allotment shall stand 
transferred to the Government for utilization for public purposes. Similarly, 
all work regarding documentation of properties also stood transferred to the 
Board of Revenue, Punjab. It is obvious from the above that there is no 
provision in the Repeal Act as amended by the Amendment Act which in 
any manner changes or alters or disregards the nature or character of public 
record of documents kept or maintained under the repealed Acts and 
Regulations under Section 2(1) thereof including RL-II Registers or in any 
manner whatsoever empowers or mandates the Government or the Board of 
Revenue Punjab including its Full Board to disregard the sanctity of such 
public record or in any manner whatsoever affects the right to inspect and 
take certified copies of such public record.      
19. 
 
Article 85 of the QSO lists various categories of documents 
which are categorized as public documents. Article 85(1) thereof stipulates 
that all documents forming the acts or records of the acts of the sovereign 
authority; of official bodies and tribunals; and of public officers, 
legislative, judicial and executive of any part of Pakistan or of a foreign 
country are public documents. Article 85(2) thereof states that public 
records kept in Pakistan of private documents are also public documents. 
Article 85(4) thereof provides that documents required to be maintained by 
a public servant under any law are public documents. Article 87 thereof 
mandates that every public officer having custody of a public document, 
which any person has a right to inspect, shall give that person on demand a 

11 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 55591 / 2022 
 
copy of it on payment of the legal fees therefor, together with a certificate 
written at the foot of such copy that it is a true copy of such document or 
part thereof, as the case may be, and such certificate shall be dated and 
subscribed by such officer with his name and his official title, and shall be 
sealed, whenever such officer is authorized by law to make use of a seal, 
and such copies so certified shall be called certified copies. In addition, 
certified copies of public records can also be obtained under the provisions 
of the Punjab Copying Fees Act, 1936 and the rules for the supply of 
copies of records under the control of Deputy Commissioners and 
Commissioners in accordance with the procedure prescribed therein. 
Therefore, it is unequivocally established that public documents kept by 
public bodies, public servants and executive constitute public record 
notwithstanding that it is not being maintained. Hence, the contention that 
RL-II Registers being no longer maintained after the repeal of settlement 
laws have lost their efficacy and as such, do not constitute public record is 
a fallacy.  
20. 
 
Article 19-A of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 unequivocally confers the right to information as a 
fundamental right to every citizen to have access to information in all 
matters of public importance subject to regulation and reasonable 
restrictions imposed by law. The Information Act was promulgated to give 
effect to the fundamental right for access to information in the Province of 
the Punjab. As per Section 2(j) thereof, the „right to information‟ includes 
the right to inspect and obtain certified copy of a document of a public 
body. Section 10 thereof invariably confers the right to information to any 
applicant and Section 10(3) specifically proclaims that an applicant shall 
not be required to provide reasons for request to information and shall only 
be required to provide an adequate description of the information and the 
details necessary to provide the requisite information. Such an application 
can only be refused where disclosure of information falls in any of the 
exception enumerated in Section 13 thereof. Needless to state that none of 
the exceptions listed in Section 13 thereof is attracted qua issuance of 
certified copies of Form RL-II. Section 24(1) further states that the 

12 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 55591 / 2022 
 
provisions of the Information Act shall take precedence over the provisions 
of any other law while Section 24(2) clarifies that an exception mentioned 
in Section 13 shall take precedence and any exception or limitation in any 
other law on right to information may not be construed to extend the scope 
of the exception in the Information Act, although such provision in other 
law may elaborate on the exception mentioned in Section 13.  
21. 
 
It follows from the above that public record under the repealed 
settlement laws including entries incorporated in Forms / RL-II Registers is 
public record for all intents and purposes. No provision of law has been 
cited by the Respondents which disregards revenue entries incorporated in 
RL-II Registers and replaces it with any fresh record with the caveat that 
record based on RL-II Registers does not constitute public record or 
extinguish the right to inspect or obtain certified copies thereof or changes 
or alters the character or nature of such record or declares the same as 
achieved or classified record or permits permanent sealing of the same. As 
such, the Board of Revenue, Punjab has no lawful authority to permanently 
seal, change or alter the nature and character of public record including  
RL-II Registers or outrightly refuse, deny the right to inspect or obtain 
certified copies thereof applied by any person in accordance with law.  
22. 
 
This is notwithstanding that the Federal Government decided 
to stop allotment of rural evacuee agricultural land vide letter dated 
25.06.1973 or that limited rights with respect to repealed settlement laws 
qua pending proceedings are protected under the Repeal Act read with the 
Amendment Act or that all confirmed khatas in RL-II Registers have 
already been mutated and incorporated in subsequent revenue record. 
Therefore, none of the reasons mentioned in the instructions of the Board 
of Revenue, Punjab contained in letters dated 25.06.1973, 19.06.1978, 
12.12.1984, 15.06.2013, 24.07.2023 and 08.01.2024 and in decisions of the 
Full Board of the Board of Revenue, Punjab dated 13.01.2023 and 
17.01.2024 for denial of certified copies of RL-II Registers such as repeal 
of settlement laws, limited existence of rights under the repealed settlement 
laws, sealing of record due to non-authenticity of entries, possibility of 
interpolation and tempering in the record and opening of a floodgate of 

13 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 55591 / 2022 
 
requests of issuance of certified copies of RL-II Registers can be made 
basis for denial of right of inspection and obtaining of certified copies of 
public record simply because access to public record by way of inspection 
and right to obtain certified copies cannot be clogged, curtailed or 
prohibited by any functionary of a public body. This is particularly so when 
the entries contained in RL-II Registers constitute basis of ownership 
rights. As such, it is not the mandate of custodian of record to undertake a 
fishing exercise into the need or purpose of a person who has applied for 
certified copies of a document constituting public record, as the same is 
specifically prohibited under Section 10(3) of the Information Act. The 
purpose may be as benign as to conduct due diligence of a particular 
property or requiring a certified copy against lost record. Therefore, the 
contention that the entire sealed RL-II Register can be produced in original 
before a Court of law is grossly misconceived since a person may require 
to inspect and obtain certified copy thereof who has no nexus with a 
pending proceeding in a Court of law. Hence, the Respondents or the Full 
Board of the Board of Revenue, Punjab grossly fell in error by inferring on 
their own by interpreting the Repeal Act read with Amendment Act that 
they are no more obliged or under a legal duty to issue certified copies of 
RL-II Registers. Suffice is to hold that interpretation of laws is the sole 
prerogative of the Superior Courts which does not fall in the domain of the 
executive.  
23. 
 
There is no cavil to the proposition that the Repeal Act read 
with Amendment Act vests the jurisdiction qua all settlement matters with 
the Full Board of the Board of Revenue, Punjab. As such, the Full Board of 
the Board of Revenue, Punjab may adopt a suitable mechanism and means 
to de-seal, secure and preserve RL-II Registers in the present form 
manually or by digitalizing such record and prescribe a reasonable 
mechanism for inspection and issuance of certified copies thereof but 
cannot outrightly deny or refuse the same.    
24. 
 
The objection of the Respondents that the Petitioner has no 
locus standi to institute this Petition is without any basis as any person can 
apply for a certified copy of public record and such person cannot be 

14 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 55591 / 2022 
 
deprived from his legal and constitutional right. Needless to state that the 
Petitioner had no efficacious remedy to redress his grievance when his 
request and endeavor to obtain certified copies of RL-II Registers had been 
declined by the Respondents before the institution and even during 
pendency of this Petition and resort to the Information Act was also met 
with failure.  
25. 
 
In view of the above, this Petition is allowed and the 
Respondents are directed to issue certified copies of RL-II Registers as 
applied for by the Petitioner within a period of 30 days from the date of this 
Judgment.
