ABID HUSSAIN CHATTHA, J: This constitutional Petition brings a 
challenge to the impugned Order dated 18.10.2022 and Judgment dated 
23.12.2022 passed by the Courts below. 
2. 
 
Briefly, Respondent No. 1 (the “Respondent”) on 15.12.2016 
instituted a suit for specific performance to recover Rs. 18,500,000/- in 
relation to an agreement to sell dated 06.05.2013 against the husband of 
Petitioner No. 1 and father of Petitioners No. 2 to 4, namely, Muhammad 
Sufyan Qasim who was proceeded ex-parte on 28.10.2017 and the suit was 
ex-parte decreed by the Civil Court vide Judgment and Decree dated 
21.01.2019. Initially, the application for setting aside ex-parte Judgment 
and Decree dated 21.01.2019 filed by the Petitioners was accepted by the 
Trial Court vide order dated 07.03.2020 but later, the Appellate Court 
while accepting appeal of the Respondent vide Judgment dated 10.10.2020 
remanded the matter to the Trial Court with a direction to decide 
application of the Petitioners afresh after settlement of issue as to the legal

W. P. No. 7834 / 2023 
 
 
competency of the Petitioners to apply for setting aside the ex-parte 
Judgment and Decree dated 21.01.2019 by providing an opportunity of 
hearing to the parties on the said issue. Thereafter, the application of the 
Petitioners for setting aside the referred ex-parte Judgment and Decree was 
concurrently dismissed by the Courts below vide impugned Order and 
Judgment. Hence, this Petition. 
3. 
 
The case of the Petitioners set-up in their application dated 
16.09.2019 for setting aside ex-parte proceedings and ex-parte Judgment 
and Decree against the said Muhammad Sufyan Qasim is that he went 
missing on 23.12.2013 regarding which an F.I.R No. 1028 / 2013 under 
Section 365 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 at Police Station, Civil Lines, 
Gujrat was got registered on 28.12.2013 and till date the said Muhammad 
Sufyan Qasim has not been recovered and still his status is as that of a 
missing person. Therefore, he is liable to be presumed as a dead person in 
terms of Articles 123 and 124 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (the 
“QSO”) and henceforth, the Petitioners as his legal heirs ought to be given 
the right to defend the suit for specific performance instituted against him. 
After remand of the case by the Appellate Court vide Order dated 
10.10.2020, the Trial Court framed an issue with regard to competency of 
the Petitioners to file Application for setting aside ex-parte Judgment and 
Decree dated 21.01.2019, whereafter, the parties recorded their respective 
evidence and the Courts below concurrently came to the conclusion that the 
Petitioners were not legally competent to file the said application for 
setting aside ex-parte Judgment and Decree. 
4. 
 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
5. 
 
At the outset, it would be pertinent to reproduce Articles 123 
& 124 of the QSO which read as under:- 
“123. Burden of proving death of person known to have 
been alive within thirty years. Subject to Art. 124, when the 
question is whether a man is alive or dead, and it is shown 
that he was alive within thirty years, the burden of proving 
that he is dead is on the person who affirms it.

W. P. No. 7834 / 2023 
 
 
124. Burden of proving that person is alive who has not 
been heard of for seven years.--When the question is whether 
a man is alive or dead, and it is proved that he has not been 
heard of for seven years by those who would naturally have 
heard of him if he had been alive the burden of proving that he 
is alive is shifted to the person who affirms it.” 
 
6. 
 
Petitioner No. 1 herself appeared in the witness box as AW-1 
and reiterated averments of the application on Oath. In documentary 
evidence, the Petitioners produced certified copies of agreement to sell as 
Ex.A-1, certified copy of Petition titled, “Sufiyan Qasim v. DPO, 
Gujranwala etc.” alongwith order dated 03.10.2013 as Ex.A-2, photocopy 
of F.I.R. dated 28.12.2013 as Mark-A and Notice in the name of 
Muhammad Sufiyan Qasim as Mark-B. Conversely, the Respondent 
appeared as RW-1 and produced photocopy of F.I.R No. 465 / 2013 as 
Mark-A, photocopy of proclamation 87 / 88 as Mark-B, photocopy of F.I.R 
No. 814 / 2013 as Mark-C and photocopy of F.I.R No. 263 / 2010 as Mark-
D. Petitioner No. 1 during evidence deposed that she did not know whether 
her husband is alive or dead as he is missing since 23.12.2013. As such, the 
Petitioners had produced evidence to the effect that Muhammad Sufyan 
Qasim had not been heard for seven years by those who definitely and 
naturally would have heard of him if he had been alive as Petitioner No. 1 
was cross-examined on 11.11.2021. Thereafter, burden to prove that 
Muhammad Sufyan Qasim is alive shifted to the Respondent but the fact of 
his misplacement could not be controverted in the evidence produced by 
the Respondent.  
7. 
 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan under similar circumstances 
has held in case titled, “Col. (Retd.) Mansoor Akbar v. Fazal-e-Rab Pirzada 
and others” (2012 SCMR 540) that when one of the legal representative of 
a person pleaded before the Trial Court that he went missing prior to 
passing of ex-parte decree against him, the right to challenge the same in 
appeal would accrue to the legal representative. The relevant paragraph No. 
17 thereof is reproduced as under:- 
“The petitioner, till date, has not placed any material either 
before the trial Court or before the appellate Court to 

4 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 7834 / 2023 
 
 
establish that the respondent No.1 never went missing nor has 
he disputed the plea of respondents Nos. 2 to 5 that 
respondent No. 1 had not been heard of since August 2004 by 
them. The provisions of Article 123 of the Qanun-e- Shahadat 
Order 1984, speak about the burden of proof of the fact about 
a person known to have been alive, which Article is subject to 
the Article 124 of the said Order, in which it has been 
provided that when the question arises as to whether a man is 
alive or dead, and it is proved that he has not been heard of 
for seven years by those who would naturally have heard of 
him, the burden of proving that such person is alive is shifted 
to the person who affirms it. The Article 124 clearly shifts the 
burden on the petitioner to establish that (a) the respondent 
No.1 is alive and (b) he intentionally has avoided to contest 
and or participate in the suit proceedings. No material has 
been brought on record by the petitioner to controvert that the 
plea taken by the respondents Nos. 2 to 5 that the respondent 
No.1 went missing since 11-8-2004. The provisions of C.P.C. 
does not provide the procedure to secure the interest of a 
missing person. In such like circumstances, where one of the 
legal representative has pleaded before the trial Court that the 
respondent No. 1 went missing prior to the passing of ex parte 
order by the trial Court against him, the right to challenge ex 
parte decree by the respondents Nos. 2 to 5, would accrue to 
them. Any finding by the trial Court on an application under 
Order I, Rule 10, C.P.C. of the respondents Nos.2 to 5, would, 
in no way, debar them from challenging ex parte decree.” 
 
8. 
 
In the instant case, the Respondent instituted his suit on 
15.12.2016, whereas, the F.I.R regarding abduction of Muhammad Sufyan 
Qasim was dated 28.12.2013 i.e. much prior to the date of institution of the 
suit. In the given circumstances, the Petitioners had a legitimate right to 
contest the suit as the purpose for passing ex-parte decree is to penalize a 
party which deliberately avoids appearance, either in person or through his 
counsel, with the ulterior object to defeat, delay or frustrate the litigation or 
is grossly negligent or fails to appear without sufficient cause, but such 
principle of law would not extend to cover an eventuality of the nature 
where the person is proved to have gone missing prior to the institution of 
the suit. 
9. 
 
In view of the above, this Petition is allowed; the impugned 
Order dated 18.10.2022 and Judgment dated 23.12.2022 passed by the 

5 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 7834 / 2023 
 
 
Courts below are set aside; and the order dated 07.03.2020 passed by the 
Trial Court accepting the application of the Petitioners for setting aside ex-
parte proceedings dated 28.10.2017 and ex-parte Judgment and Decree 
dated 21.01.2019 is upheld. The Trial Court is directed to proceed with the 
pending suit in accordance with law. The parties are directed to appear 
before the Trial Court on 01.11.2023 alongwith certified copy of this 
Judgment.
