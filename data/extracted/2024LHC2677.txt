This is an appeal under Section 22 of the Financial 
Institutions 
(Recovery 
of 
Finances) 
Ordinance, 
2001 
(‘Ordinance’) whereby the appellants have assailed the order 
dated 23.11.2022 passed by the Judge Banking Court-II, Multan 
dismissing objection petition of the appellants with regard to the 
determination of the cost of funds. 
2. 
Facts of the case briefly are that the respondent-Bank 
instituted Civil Suit No.179 of 2014 on 03.06.2014 for the 
recovery of Rs.26,59,813.32 which was decreed vide ex-parte 
judgment dated 27.08.2014 by the Banking Court No.III, Multan 
for the recovery of Rs.12,71,512.67 in favour of the respondent- 
Bank against the appellants jointly and severally with costs and 
cost of funds was also awarded to the respondent-Bank from 
01.09.2011  till the date of realization. During execution 
proceedings, the appellants/judgment-debtors deposited the 
decretal 
amount, however, controversy arose 
regarding 
determination of the cost of funds as the appellants filed an 
application for determination of the exact amount of cost of 
funds. On account of considerable delay in the decision, the 
appellants requested the Banking Court for permission to deposit 
under protest the cost of funds of Rs.5,11,012/- demanded by the 
decree-holder/Bank vide its application dated 30.01.2016, which 
was conditionally accepted on 12.02.2016 to the extent that if 
the judgment debtors deposited Rs.5,11,012/- then the decree-
holder/Bank 
was 
to 
redeem 
the 
mortgaged 
property.

Execution First Appeal No.13 of 2023 
 
Consequently, the appellants deposited the aforementioned amount of cost 
of funds. Accordingly, clearance certificate dated 07.09.2016 was issued 
stating therein that liabilities (as per Court decree with 100% cost of funds 
and legal charges) against the facility was fully adjusted and nothing was 
outstanding against the Running Finance Facility, which was recorded as 
such by the Banking Court in its order dated 08.09.2016. Subsequently, the 
Bank submitted its statement/calculation of cost of funds with the Court 
claiming therein difference of an amount of Rs.3,10,986/-. The appellants-
judgment-debtors disputed the aforementioned difference in the statement 
submitted by the decree-holder/Bank while questioning the very basis of 
calculation made therein. The Banking Court obtained report from the 
amicus curiae which was submitted on 08.03.2018, who agreed with the 
statement submitted by the Bank. The appellants submitted their 
objections on the report of amicus curiae extra claim which were rejected 
on 23.11.2022 by the Banking Court, Multan-II in the following terms:-  
“It is noteworthy to mention here that to resolve the difference 
between the statements of cost of funds submitted by both the 
parties, my learned predecessor appointed amicus curiae on 
25.01.2018 and at that time the judgment debtor did not raise any 
objection as the appointment of Mr. Muhammad Ishaq Rana 
Advocate as amicus curiae. Moreover, the judgment debtor has 
failed to specify any entry with date that he has been charged 
with the cost of funds on the amount other than the principal 
amount. 
Amicus 
curiae 
has 
rightly 
relied 
upon 
the 
"EXPLANATIONS" of Sec 10(4) of the FIO 2001, which is 
reproduced as under:- 
"For the purposes of clause (b) any payment made 
to a financial institution by customer in respect of 
a finance shall be appropriated first against other 
amounts relating to the finance and the balance, if 
any, against the principal amount of the finance" 
According to be aforesaid provision of law decree holder Bank 
has appropriated first the amount paid by the judgment debtor 
against other amounts such as mark up or cost of funds, which 
are relating to the finance and the balance amount paid by the 
judgment debtor was appropriated against the principal  amount 
of the finance. Record nowhere reflects that bank has charged 
cost of fund against cost of funds etc. It appears that objection 
has been field in order to linger on the execution petition. The 
decree under execution was passed in year 2014 and has not yet 
been satisfied till today. In these circumstances objections filed 
by the judgment debtor are not sustainable in the eyes of law”.

3. 
Learned counsel for the appellants contends that the impugned order 
does not take into account the fact that the amount which was deposited by 
the appellants ought to have been adjusted against the principal amount. 
He further contends that the statement of account produced by the decree 
holder/Bank shows that amount of cost of funds was simultaneously being 
recovered from the appellants, which is imperssible being in contravention 
to the letter and spirit of Section 3 of the Ordinance. He maintains that 
Section 10(4)(b) of the Ordinance does not have any connection with cost 
of funds inasmuch as the said provision only relates to the leave granting 
stage before a decree is passed, whereas cost of funds has no existence at 
that stage of proceedings but becomes payable by operation of law i.e. 
Section 3 of the Ordinance once a decree is passed. He finally contends 
that the impugned order is liable to be set aside for clearly being 
unwarranted by law.  
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent-Bank has supported 
the impugned order for reasons stated therein.  
5. 
Heard. Record perused.  
6. 
The primary question of law involved in the instant appeal is 
whether the explanation contained in Section 10(4) of the Ordinance is 
applicable for the purpose of appropriation of cost of funds decreed under 
Section 3 of the Ordinance?  
7. 
Entitlement of financial institutions to have cost of funds is 
provided in Section 3 of the Ordinance, which read as follows: 
Duty of a customer. (1) it shall be the duty of a customer to fulfil 
his obligations to the financial institution.  
(2) Where the customer defaults in the discharge of his obligation, 
he shall be liable to pay, for the period from the date of his default 
till realization of the cost of funds of the financial institution as 
certified by the State Bank of Pakistan from time to time, apart 
from such other civil and criminal liabilities that he may incur 
under the contract or rules or any other law for the time being in 
force.  
(3) For the purpose of this section a judgement against a 
customer under this Ordinance shall mean that he is in default of 
his duty under sub-section (1), and the ensuing decree shall 
provide for payment of the cost of funds as determined under sub-
section (2).          

4 
Execution First Appeal No.13 of 2023 
 
8. 
From perusal of the above provisions, it is manifest that while sub-
section (1) of Section (3) casts a duty upon a customer to fulfill his 
obligations towards the financial institution, sub-section (2) of the said 
Section stipulates consequences of default in the discharge of obligation 
by a customer. Such consequences, in addition to other civil and criminal 
liabilities which a customer may incur under the contract or rules or any 
other law for the time being in force, include liability to pay the cost of 
funds for the period commencing the date of his default till realization. 
Section 3(3) of the Ordinance, however, clearly indicates that for the 
purposes of liability towards the cost of funds, a judgement against a 
customer under this Ordinance shall mean that he is in default of his duty 
under sub-section (1) and in such cases it has been made mandatory for 
the ensuing decree to provide for payment of the cost of funds as 
determined under sub-section (2). In other words, for the purposes of 
awarding the cost of funds, default means judicially determined default in 
duties under sub-section (1). Therefore, neither the amount of cost of 
funds could lawfully be determined by the respondent-bank prior to the 
decree passed in the suit for recovery filed against the appellants nor any 
amount deposited by the appellants could be adjusted thereagainst before 
passing of the judgment and decree. Reliance in this regard is placed on 
the case of Habib Bank AG Zurich through Manager Vs. Mustafa 
Shamsuddin Ghatilla and 2 others (2003 CLD 658). Be that as it may, 
where default of a customer in discharge of his obligation is judicially 
determined, liability for the cost of funds is mandatory which is specified 
in Section 3(2) of the Ordinance to be for the period from the date of 
default of the customer till realization. Reliance in this regard is placed on 
the cases of SME Bank Limited through Branch Manager Vs. Messrs 
Punjab Store through Proprietor and another (2022 CLD 251), Messrs 
Divine Developers (Pvt.) Ltd. And others Vs. Bank of Punjab (2019 CLD 
489) and Habib Bank Limited through Authorized Attorneys Vs. Pak Poly 
Products (Pvt.) Ltd. And 3 others (2013 CLD 1661).  
9. 
A suit for the recovery of finances instituted by the financial 
institutions can be defended only with leave of the Court as required 
under Section 10 of the Ordinance, which prescribes limitation, procedure 

5 
Execution First Appeal No.13 of 2023 
 
and the form in which such leave is to be sought. Section 10(4) of the 
Ordinance, reads as follows:-    
(4)In the case of a suit for recovery instituted by a financial 
institution the application for leave to defend shall also 
specifically state the following:- 
(a) the amount of finance availed by the defendant 
from the financial institution; the amounts paid by 
the defendant to the financial institution and the 
dates of payments; 
(b) the amount of finance and other amounts 
relating to the finance payable by the defendant to 
the financial institution upto the date of institution 
of the suit; 
(c) the amounts of finance and other amounts 
relating to the finance payable by the defendant to 
the financial institution upto the date of institution 
of the suit; 
(d) the amount if any which the defendant disputes 
as payable to the financial institution and facts in 
support thereof.  
Explanation:-- For the purposes of clause (b) any 
payment made to a financial institution by a 
customer in respect of a finance shall be 
appropriated first against other amounts relating to 
the finance and the balance, if any, against the 
principal amount of the finance. 
The explanation in Section 10(4) of the Ordinance is expressly and 
exclusively for application thereof to clause (b) of the said sub-section to 
seek leave to defend a suit for recovery instituted by a financial 
institution. The requirement under Section 10(4)(b) of the Ordinance to 
specifically state the amount of finance and other amounts relating to 
finance payable by the defendant to the financial institution is for the 
period upto the date of institution of the suit, which is essentially for the 
purpose of determining liability for passing a decree.  
10. 
Once a decree is passed, the financial institution has no discretion 
to appropriate the amount paid against other amounts including cost of 
funds. All repayments made by a judgment-debtor after passing of the 
decree have to be first adjusted towards decretal amount and surplus 
towards cost of funds. Conversely, if the option to adjust cost of funds is 
extended to the decree holder/Bank, it would always prefer to appropriate 
amounts paid for the adjustment of decretal amount towards cost of funds 

6 
Execution First Appeal No.13 of 2023 
 
first to maintain outstanding claim of decree as a source of generating 
income perpetually, which would defeat the scheme and spirit of the 
Ordinance, including Section 3 thereof. Indeed, Section 10(4) of the 
Ordinance does not have any connection whatsoever with cost of funds, 
which obligation accrues once liability towards the financial institution is 
determined when the decree is passed. Furthermore, execution of decree 
passed by a Banking Court is governed by Section 19 of the Ordinance 
which contains no provision for applicability of the explanation contained 
in Section 10(4) ibid. Likewise, Section 3 of the Ordinance which 
prescribes duty of a customer to pay cost of funds of the financial 
institution makes no reference to the application of above explanation 
either.  
11. 
In the instant case, the decree-holder/Bank has clearly erred in law 
in appropriating repayments made by the judgment-debtors firstly towards 
other amounts such as cost of funds instead of decretal debt on the pretext 
of applicability of the explanation in Section 10(4) of the Ordinance and 
the learned Judge Banking Court has acted manifestly unlawfully in 
approving the same, therefore, the impugned order dated 23.11.2022 is 
unsustainable in law thus liable to be set aside. 
12. 
For the foregoing reasons, this appeal is allowed, the impugned 
order dated 23.11.2022 is set aside. The parties shall be free to move a 
fresh application before the Banking Court concerned for payment of 
remaining decretal debt or return of excess amount erroneously 
appropriated, if any, keeping in view the above determination. There shall 
be no order as to costs.
