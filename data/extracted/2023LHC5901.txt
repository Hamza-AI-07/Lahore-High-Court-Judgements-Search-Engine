Mian Qaisar Mahmood, Advocate. 
Respondents No.1 to 5

Respondents No. 6 
Mr. Shams Mehmood, Advocate. 
 
    Anwaar Hussain J. The petitioner, having secured the 
highest marks in the written test held for the recruitment against a 
single post of Assistant (BS-15), in the Department of Archaeology & 
Museums, Government of Pakistan, Islamabad, was amongst the top 
five short-listed candidates to be interviewed for the said post. It is her 
case that she has been non-suited by abuse of process as respondent 
No.3, who happens to be the father of respondent No.6 and also the 
Chairman of Departmental Selection Committee (“the DSC”), has 
appointed his own son/respondent No.6, hence, the said appointment 
is result of nepotism and liable to be set aside.  
2. 
Conversely, in report and parawise comments filed by 
respondents No.1 to 4, it has been averred that the allegations levelled 
are incorrect and the appointment of respondent No.6 was made after 
fulfilling all codal formalities, however, it has not been denied that 
respondent No.6 is the real son of respondent No.3. Learned Assistant 
Attorney General, on instructions, submits that since the DSC 
comprises of 03 members, constituted in accordance with law, 
therefore, it was not possible for respondent No.3 to select his own 
son (respondent No.6), on his wishes and whims and the decision was 
that of the DSC and not respondent No.3 alone.

Arguments heard. Record perused.

4. 
In relation to the formal decision making processes concerning 
recruitment and selection, possibility that potential conflict of interest 
may arise cannot be ruled out. Integrity of a selection panel like the 
DSC vested with power to award marks in interview matters a lot and 
it is expected that if any conflict of interest arises, the disclosure is 
made and such member of the selection committee should recuse from 
proceeding further in order to lend credence and maintain 
transparency and public confidence in recruitment process, let alone 
heading the DSC as it happened in the instant case. 
5. 
There is no denial to the fact that interview was one of the 
major components of the impugned recruitment process inasmuch as 
the same constituted 30% of the total marks, and out of the said 
marks, the Chairman of the DSC was vested with the highest number 
of marks to be awarded to a candidate as compared to other members 
of the DSC, individually. Moreover, respondent No. 3 is admittedly a 
Grade-20 officer of the respondent department whereas the other two 
members are in Grade-19. It is also admitted feature of the case that 
respondent No.6 was given the highest marks in interview. The final 
point table prepared by the DSC headed by respondent No.3, who is 
father of respondent No.6, reads as under:

W.P No.27148/2023 
 
 
6. 
On a pointed question by this Court, learned Assistant Attorney 
General along with the Departmental Representative in attendance, as 
also learned counsel for respondent No.6, could not refute that 
respondent No.3, who was Chairman of the DSC never recused 
himself from the chairmanship of the DSC constituted for conducting 
the interviews of the short-listed candidates, including his own son/ 
respondent No.6. Mere fact that respondent No.3 never recused 
himself from heading the DSC before whom his son/respondent No.6 
was to appear for interview offends the principle of transparency 
required for filling public posts. It was the two extra marks in the 
interview granted by the DSC that gave advantage to respondent No.6 
to occupy the single post as there was close tie between the top five 
short listed candidates including the petitioner, who stood second by 
difference of said two marks. The question mark on the process of 
recruitment is obvious and level of transparency prevailing in the DSC 
becomes acute in view of the fact that the petitioner had a Masters’ 
degree as opposed to respondent No.6, who is a graduate, which fact 
has not been denied by the respondents albeit that higher qualification 
of the petitioner has no bearing on the short listing as also the 
interview as no additional marks were to be given on account of 
higher qualification, possessed by a candidate. This fact is also belied 
by columns No. 2 to 5 of the above table that pertains to “relevant 
qualifications and experience”. 
7. 
Be that as it may, in view of above discussion, the interview 
process, on the face of it is violative of principle of transparency and 
fairness that is stone etched rule to be followed and observed in 
recruitment process to the public post(s). The manner in which 
respondent No.6 has been appointed impinges upon the basic 
constitutional guarantees enshrined in Articles 4, 18, 25 and 27 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 hence, cannot 
sustain. As a natural corollary, the appointment of respondent No.6 
(Umer Azeem) as Assistant (BS-15) is declared to be result of 
favoritism and abuse of process and, therefore, set aside. The

W.P No.27148/2023 
 
 
administrative department/competent authority is directed that top 
five(5) candidates, who obtained the highest marks in the written test 
for the said post shall be re-interviewed by a new, independent and 
impartial DSC, in accordance with law.  
8. 
This constitutional petition is allowed, in the above terms.
