        Petitioners in this constitutional petition 
have challenged orders dated 06.6.2024 and 
22.7.2024 of the courts below in terms whereof  
the application for appointment of Receiver was 
accepted and appeal thereagainst was dismissed. 
2. 
Respondent Nos.1 to 12, Muhammad 
Sarwar, etc. (now represented by their legal 
heirs) instituted a suit for declaration that they 
were entitled to their Islamic share from the 
inheritance of late Fateh Din who passed away 
on 01.2.1905. Suit was resisted by the 
petitioners/defendants. An application under 
Order XL, Rule 1, C.P.C. for appointment of 
Receiver was filed which was allowed by the 
learned Civil Judge, who appointed the Revenue 
Officer as Receiver vide order dated 06.6.2024. 
Petitioners/defendants challenged the order in 
appeal which was dismissed by learned Addl. 
District Judge vide order dated 22.7.2024. These 
orders 
are 
now 
assailed 
in 
the 
instant 
constitutional jurisdiction

-2- 
 
 
 
3. 
Learned 
counsel 
for 
the 
petitioners 
submitted that the impugned orders are illegal 
and untenable; that the status of respondents as 
LRs and the extent of their share in late Fateh 
Din’s estate is yet to be determined as per order 
of Supreme Court while petitioners’ entitlement 
stands determined in the earlier round of 
litigation which was given effect in the Revenue 
Record; that the respondents had no right at 
present to claim appointment of Receiver nor had 
any prima facie case for the issuance of such an 
order and that the courts below failed to satisfy 
as to existence of mandatory grounds for seeking 
appointment of Receiver under Order XL, Rule 
1, C.P.C. and were persuaded by extraneous and 
untenable circumstances; that the respondents 
being not in possession, petitioners held the 
property to the extent of their share in accordance 
with law who could not be deprived of the 
possession in the garb of the appointment of 
Receiver at the instance of persons who are yet to 
seek determination of their rights, if any, in the 
property and in any case their claim was to the 
extent of fractional share; that no relief in the 
form of appointment of Receiver which was a 
harsh remedy could be allowed; that their suit 
was not maintainable and that the courts below 
ignored 
all 
these 
important 
questions. 
Contrariwise learned counsel for the respondents 
supported the impugned orders and maintained 
that in the circumstances of the case and keeping 
in view the chequered history it was obvious that 
the respondents were deprived of the mesne 

       
  W.P. No.48544 of 2024 
 
 
 
-3- 
 
 
 
profit of land to the extent of their share and that 
the interest of justice warranted the appointment 
of Receiver to preserve the rights of all 
concerned and that the petitioners were not 
denied of any title by the impugned order and, 
therefore, they could not feel aggrieved thereof 
and that the order in the circumstances was just 
and fair which did not warrant interference. 
4. 
The submissions made by learned counsel 
for the parties have been considered, the relevant 
documents have also been examined. Factual 
perspective which is relevant for the decision of 
this petition are that Fateh Din died on 
01.2.1905, he was owner of 2315 kanals and 16 
marlas of land in village Shaam Din Wahgra, 
Tehsil Depalpur, District Okara. On his demise 
the land devolved upon his widow (Mst. Baigan), 
and mother (Mst. Shahadat Bibi) as limited 
owners under the custom. On Mst. Shahadat 
Bibi’s death in 1925, widow of deceased Fateh 
Din, Mst. Baigan became the life estate-holder of 
entire land which came to an end on 
promulgation of Punjab Muslim Personal Law 
Shariat Application Act (Removal of Doubts) 
Ordinance, 
1972 
under 
whose 
provisions 
inheritance devolved upon the LRs of Fateh Din, 
the last male owner under Islamic law and 
mutation was entered in the name of late Fateh 
Din’s widow, mother and one sister, namely, 
Mst. Roshnai. Muhammad Anwar instituted a 
civil suit on 02.6.1965 claiming that Fateh Din 
had another sister Mst. Mehran and that he being 
her LR was entitled 1/26 share in the estate of 

       
  W.P. No.48544 of 2024 
 
 
 
-4- 
 
 
 
Fateh Din. The learned Civil Judge dismissed the 
suit but in appeal the suit was decreed declaring 
Mst. Mehran as sister of late Fateh Din. The 
matter went up to Supreme Court of Pakistan and 
the findings regarding the existence of Mst. 
Mehran Bibi as sister of Fateh Din were upheld 
vide judgment dated 22.2.1999 and Muhammad 
Anwar was declared to be entitled to get 4/195 
share in the estate. The findings were given to the 
extent of share of Muhammad Anwar while the 
other claimants were left to get their shares 
determined through court of law.  
5. 
The operative part of judgment dated 
22.2.1999 of the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal 
No. 85 of 1994 titled  Mst. Baigan widow of 
Fateh Din through L.Rs. and others v. 
Muhammad Anwar and others is as follow: 
“In these circumstances, we are not inclined to 
interfere with the concurrent findings of fact 
recorded by the 2 Courts below on issues No. 2 to 
4 holding Muhammad Anwar as collateral of late 
Fateh Din. However, in so far the question of 
determination of share of Muhammad Anwar in the 
estate left behind by deceased Fateh Din is 
concerned, the learned counsel for the appellants 
as well as respondent No.1 agreed that the 
calculation of the share of Muhammad Anwar was 
not in accordance with the law of Shariah. The 
learned counsel were, accordingly, given time to 
calculate the share of Muhammad Anwar on the 
basis, that Fateh Din at the time of his death was 
survived by his mother Mst. Shahadat, Widow Mst. 
Baigan, Sisters Mst. Roshani and Mehran. The 
learned counsel admit that on the basis of above 
mentioned legal heirs, the shares of Mst. 
Shahadat works to 2/13, Mst. Baigan 3/13 and 2 
sisters Mehran and Roshani 8/13. Accordingly, the 
appellants are entitled to 3/13 share out of the 
estate of late Fateh Din while plaintiff's share in 
the estate of the deceased works out to 4/195 as 
Mst. Thari, who was daughter of Mst. Mehran had 
2 daughters namely, Mst. Sughran and Mst. 

       
  W.P. No.48544 of 2024 
 
 
 
-5- 
 
 
 
Sakina and 2 sons Anwar and Sarwar. The 
learned 
counsel 
for 
Muhammad 
Ramzan 
(respondent No.6), who was later impleaded as a 
defendant in the suit, contends that Muhammad 
Ramzan is also entitled to the share in the estate 
left behind by late Fateh Din as a collateral. We 
are afraid, the question whether Muhammad 
Ramzan is also entitled to a share in the estate left 
behind by late Fateh Din as a collateral, cannot be 
gone into by this Court as his right to inherit as a 
collateral of Fateh Din has not been determined at 
any stage so far. It is, however, open to 
Muhammad Ramzan or his legal heirs to have 
their entitlement determined in accordance with 
the law before claiming any share in the estate of 
the deceased Fateh Din. Since only one person, 
Muhammad Anwar who is one of the 4 children left 
by Mst. Thari, daughter of Mehran, has come to 
the Court for determination of his share, therefore, 
we have only determined his share in the present 
proceedings which comes to 4/195. We, 
accordingly, modify the judgment of the High Court 
to the extent that the appellants are held entitled to 
3/13 share in the estate left by Fateh Din while 
plaintiff/respondent No.1 is held entitled to the 
share of 4/195. The appeal stands disposed of 
accordingly with no order as to costs.” 
6. 
Later correction of mutation No. 379  
relating to inheritance of Fateh Din was made to 
give effect to the decision of the Supreme Court, 
mutation was entered in the name of Mst. 
Roshnai (sister of Fateh Din), LRs of Mst. 
Baigan (widow of Fateh Din) and Muhammad 
Anwar one of the LRs of Mst. Mehran. The 
names of rest of the LRs were left out to be 
determined by the court of law as per the order of 
Supreme Court of Pakistan. It appears that an 
appeal was filed before the Collector and 
thereafter a Revision before the Executive 
District Officer (Revenue) was filed which were 
decided 
vide 
order 
dated 
26.5.2000 
and 
06.7.2002 respectively. The aggrieved persons 

       
  W.P. No.48544 of 2024 
 
 
 
-6- 
 
 
 
went to the Board of Revenue by filing ROR No. 
1973 of 2002. The  Member Board of Revenue 
accepted the revision petition vide order dated 
24.1.2005 and set aside the impugned order of 
Collector 
and 
Executive 
District 
Officer 
(Revenue) and remanded the case to the 
Tehsildar/AC-1, Depalpur to decide the matter of 
inheritance in the presence of parties.   
7. 
  Muhammad Anwar filed W.P. No. 4451 
of 2005 titled Dost Muhammad, etc. v. 
Muhammad Sarwar and others against the order 
dated 24.1.2005 of Member Board of Revenue 
which was allowed vide order dated 08.12.2015 
wherein the order of Member Board of Revenue 
dated 
24.1.2005 
was 
set 
aside. 
Review 
application No. 3 of 2016 in W.P. No. 4451 of 
2005 was filed before this Court which was 
decided by a Division Bench vide Order dated 
13.12.2017 against which Order,  C.P. No. 97 of 
2018 titled Dost Muhammad etc. v. Muhammad 
Sarwar, etc. was filed which was allowed vide 
Order dated 03.11.2020 by the Supreme Court, in 
result, the petition was converted into an appeal 
and was allowed and the impugned order of the 
Division Bench of this Court dated 13.12.2017 in 
Review was set aside. The operative part of 
Order dated 03.11.2020 of Supreme Court reads 
as follows: 
‘Civil Petition No.97 of 2018 
 
In a previous round of litigation this Court vide its 
judgment dated 22.02.1999 passed in Civil Appeal 
No. 85 of 1994 titled as Mst. Baigan, etc. v. 
Mohammad Anwar, etc. (Civil Appeal No. 85 of 
1994) held as follows: 
 
 

       
  W.P. No.48544 of 2024 
 
 
 
-7- 
 
 
 
“Since 
only 
one 
person, 
Muhammad Anwar who is one of 
the 4 children left by Mst. Thari, 
daughter of Mehran, has come to 
the Court for determination of his 
share, therefore, we have only 
determined his share in the present 
proceedings which comes to 4/195. 
We, 
accordingly, 
modify 
the 
judgment of the High Court to the 
extent that the appellants are held 
entitled to 3/13 share in the estate 
left 
by 
Fateh 
Din 
while 
plaintiff/respondent No. 1 is held 
entitled to the share of 4/195. The 
appeal 
stands 
disposed 
of 
accordingly with no order as to 
costs.” 
Pursuant to the said judgment the share of 
Muhammad Anwar was calculated and duly 
mutated by 
the 
revenue authorities. 
The 
respondents claim also to be the legal heirs of Mst. 
Mehran. The right of the respondents has not been 
determined in the judgment of the Supreme Court. 
Consequently, the revenue authorities namely the 
Revenue Officer, A.C. and EDO(R) have referred 
the determination of the respondents' entitlement 
to a share in the legacy of Fateh Din deceased to 
the Civil Court. The learned Member Board of 
Revenue set aside that direction and referred the 
matter back to the Revenue Officer to determine 
the question himself. 
2.  
The learned Single Bench in its judgment 
dated 08.12.2015 made reference to a plethora of 
case law and held that the matter involved the 
adjudication of long standing entries in the 
Revenue Record and of complicated question of 
inheritance in favour of legal heirs going down the 
family tree by at least two generations. The review 
application filed by the respondents was not heard 
by the learned author Judge. In his absence it was 
heard by a learned Division Bench. Through the 
impugned judgment dated 13.12.2017 a direction 
has been issued for the respondents to be given 
their shares in the legacy of Fateh Din deceased. 
By doing so the main question in issue namely the 
determination of their shares has not been 
touched at all. We do not find merit in the 
impugned judgment delivered the learned review 
Bench.” 
8. 
In light of the aforesaid orders the 
respondents/plaintiffs filed the present suit for 
declaration for determination of legal heirs of 
late Fateh Din and Mst. Mehran and for 

       
  W.P. No.48544 of 2024 
 
 
 
-8- 
 
 
 
determination of their shares in accordance with 
Islamic Law. They claimed their relationship 
with Mst. Mehran sister of Fateh Din through her 
daughter Mst. Thari, which suit was contested. 
An application under Order XL, Rule 1, C.P.C. 
was filed in the suit with the allegations that 
determination of share of Muhammad Anwar 
was only made while the Islamic shares of other 
legal heirs of Mst. Thari was left for 
determination and the petitioners/defendants 
were receiving benefits of the entire land which 
was not legally permissible.  It was  the case of 
the respondents that Mst. Mehran was sister of 
late Fateh Din and Mst. Thari was daughter of 
Mst. Mehran and that Mst. Thari had two sons 
namely Muhammad Anwar and Muhammad 
Sarwar and two daughters Mst. Sughran and Mst. 
Sakina and that Muhammad Anwar had been 
declared as LR with specific share in the suit 
property i.e. 4/195 share by the Supreme Court, 
the respondents were also entitled as being legal 
heirs and being brother and sisters of Muhammad 
Anwar but that the petitioners had been enjoying 
the whole property instead of their share as 
declared by the Supreme Court, and that it will 
be just and convenient for the parties to appoint a 
Receiver to preserve the property and the 
benefits drawn there-from for all concerned. 
9. 
Perusal of the judgment  dated 22.2.1999 of 
the Supreme Court referred supra in Civil Appeal 
No.85 of 1994 titled Mst. Baigan widow of Fateh 
Din deceased through L.Rs and others v. 
Muhammad Anwar, Muhammad Sarwar and 

       
  W.P. No.48544 of 2024 
 
 
 
-9- 
 
 
 
others shows that it was declared that at the time 
of death of Fateh Din he was survived by  mother 
Mst. Shahadat Bibi, widow Mst. Baigan and 
sisters Mst. Roshnai and Mst. Mehran. The share 
of inheritance of Mst. Shahadat Bibi was 2/13, 
Mst. Baigan as 3/13 and sisters Mst. Roshnai and 
Mst. Mehran as 8/13 while the plaintiff therein 
i.e. Muhammad Anwar in the said proceedings 
had the share in the estate of Fateh Din to the 
extent of 4/195 as  Mst. Thari who was daughter 
of Mst. Mehran had two daughters namely 
Mst.Sughran and Mst. Sakina and  two sons 
Muhammad Anwar and Muhammad Sarwar. It 
was observed that only one person Muhammad 
Anwar who was one of the four children left by 
Mst. Thari daughter of Mst. Mehran had come to 
the Court for determination of his share, 
therefore, the Court determined his share in those 
proceedings which comes to 4/195 share while 
the appellant Mst. Baigan, etc. therein were 
entitled to 3/13 shares in the estate of Fateh Din. 
In regard to the other claimants as shareholders, 
the matter was left for  determination by the 
court of competent jurisdiction.  
10. In this backdrop respondents’ case in the 
present suit is that Muhammad Anwar having 
been declared as one of the grandchildren of Mst. 
Mehran through Mst. Thari (Mehran’s daughter), 
the respondents/plaintiffs who were claiming 
same status as brothers and sisters of Muhammad 
Anwar from Mst. Thari, had the same right in the 
property  and are entitled to their share in the 
property of Fateh Din for which a determination 

       
  W.P. No.48544 of 2024 
 
 
 
-10- 
 
 
 
was solicited in the suit through the court. It was 
plaintiffs/respondents’ 
grievance 
that 
Muhammad Anwar  now represented by legal 
heirs and other defendants were in occupation of 
the property in entirety  beyond their share in the 
property while the plaintiffs/respondents were 
being deprived of the benefits thereof. In this 
background the appointment of Receiver was 
solicited. As against the stance of the respondents 
the plea of the petitioners/defendants throughout 
had been that their share of entitlement in the 
estate having been determined by the Court of 
final jurisdiction, they could not be deprived  of 
the possession of the property at the instance of 
respondents/plaintiffs, whose claim was only to 
the extent of a fractional part of  property. It was 
added that the respondents/plaintiffs were yet to 
prove their right in the property, being so, they 
could not be given any preference against the 
rightful owner declared by the Supreme Court 
and that the order of appointment of Receiver 
was wholly unjust and contrary to the rule of law.   
11.    Main reason that prevailed with the 
learned Civil Judge for accepting the application 
to appoint a Receiver was that the parties in the 
suit were in litigation since more than a century 
and that the court also deemed it appropriate to 
appoint Receiver with the reason that it will 
develop more interest of the parties  to get 
decided their case at the earliest rather to prolong 
it for another century and that Order XL, Rule 1, 
C.P.C. empowers the court to appoint a Receiver, 
where it appears to be just and convenient to 

       
  W.P. No.48544 of 2024 
 
 
 
-11- 
 
 
 
preserve 
the 
property 
pending 
judicial 
determination of the rights of the parties. In 
appeal  the order was affirmed by the learned 
Addl. District Judge observing that being one of 
the progeny of Mst. Thari daughter of 
Mst.Mehran sister of Fateh Din, the entitlement 
of Muhammad Anwar as 4/195 share in the estate 
left by Fateh Din, which was determined while 
Mst. Baigan, etc., appellants in appeal before the 
Supreme Court, were held entitled to 3/13  share 
in the estate of Fateh Din, it was within the 
discretion of the court to appoint Receiver before 
or after passing of  decree and that the question 
regarding legal rights of heirship was raised and 
that the court was empowered to appoint a 
Receiver.  
12.    The question in this case is as to whether 
the order of appointment of Receiver by the trial 
court and affirmation thereof by the appellate 
court  are not contrary to the principles as laid by 
the superior courts in the matter of appointment 
of Receiver or that the reasons are perfunctory  
and whether the discretion in this case was 
exercised arbitrarily or in a mechanical manner. 
Rule 1 of Order XL, C.P.C. provides that where 
it appears to the court that it is just and 
convenient to appoint a Receiver for preservation 
of property, the court can appoint a Receiver. It 
is a settled rule that order of appointment of 
Receiver being harsh and onerous, which shall be 
passed with care and cautaion. In the case of 
Sardar Wali Muhammad v. Sardar Muhammad 
Iqbal Khan Mokal and 7 others  (PLD 1975 Lah. 

       
  W.P. No.48544 of 2024 
 
 
 
-12- 
 
 
 
492) it was observed that appointment of 
Receiver was not a matter of course and that such 
discretion was to be exercised in accordance with 
principles enunciated by the superior courts 
which included the consideration that this power 
should be sparingly used, to safeguard the 
interest of all the parties as well as the property 
which is subject matter of the litigation and that 
possession of persons in bona fide occupation  of 
the property should not be disturbed unless there 
are allegations of wastage or dissipation of 
property  or apprehension of irreparable loss and 
injury. In Muhammad Usman v. Muhammad 
Shahbaz and 7 others (2007 MLD 1121) it was 
observed that remedy provided in terms of Order 
XL, Rule 1, C.P.C. by its very nature is harsh and 
that powers under the said provision of law are to 
be exercised sparingly and with utmost caution. 
In Mst. Ghulam Sughran alias Sughra Naz v. 
Muhammad Ayyub Dar (1989 CLC 2493) it was 
observed in the context of plea for appointment 
of Receiver that parties being co-sharers, it was 
well-settled that a co-sharer in possession of a 
joint property was not liable to be ousted 
therefrom, except on partition by metes and 
bounds. In Mst. Mariyam v. Mst.  Khtoon Bai 
and others (2005  YLR  3265) also principles to 
be kept in view while considering the plea for 
appointment 
of 
Receiver 
were 
reiterated 
including the existence of emergency or danger 
or loss demanding immediate action while the 
right of the applicant must be reasonably clear 
and free from doubt. In (Shahzadi) Sharif Sultana 

       
  W.P. No.48544 of 2024 
 
 
 
-13- 
 
 
 
v. (Brig. Shahzada) Sher Muhammad Jan and 
another [PLD 1958 (W.P.) Lah. 288] it was 
observed one of the principles to be kept in view 
while 
considering 
the 
application 
for 
appointment of Receiver was that bona fide 
occupant of property cannot be disturbed in the 
garb of appointment of Receiver and that co-
sharer in undivided property is entitled to retain 
the possession till such time the property is 
partitioned and specific share is allocated.  
13. Considering the facts in the instant case, the 
share of Mst. Baigan, etc. and Mst. Shahadat 
Bibi, as mother and widow of deceased Fateh 
Din, have been determined up to the Supreme 
Court and they were held entitled to receive 3/13 
and 2/13 share in the estate of Fateh Din while 
Mst. Roshnai  and Mst. Mehran, sisters of Fateh 
Din, were declared to be entitled as 8/13 share. 
Similarly, Muhammad Anwar’s share as one of 
the sons of Mst. Thari daughter of Mst. Mehran 
was declared as 4/195 share and the status of 
other claimants of Mst. Thari was left to be 
determined 
by 
the 
court 
of 
competent 
jurisdiction. In these circumstances there was 
substance in the submission of petitioners’ 
learned counsel that their shares having been 
determined in the property while the share of 
plaintiffs/respondents as heirs of Mst. Thari was 
yet to be determined, therefore, the petitioners  
could not be deprived of the possession of 
property, as a co-sharer to the extent of their 
share particularly when no relief of possession 
was claimed in the plaint and the order of learned 

       
  W.P. No.48544 of 2024 
 
 
 
-14- 
 
 
 
courts below for appointment of Receiver could 
not be held as just and convenient or in accord 
with settled principle of law. Mere fact that the 
parties were fighting for their rights of 
inheritance since long would not be a ground to 
appoint a Receiver or to deprive the persons who 
were declared to be co-sharers to a specific 
extent by the Supreme Court.   
14. For the reasons supra instant constitutional 
petition is allowed and orders dated 06.6.2024 
and 22.7.2024 of the courts below are declared to 
be 
illegal 
and 
without 
jurisdiction 
and 
accordingly set aside. The application for 
appointment of Receiver, as a result, shall be 
deemed to have been declined. The learned Civil 
Judge seized of the matter shall ensure final 
decision of the suit within four months by fixing 
shortest dates and ensuring that unnecessary 
adjournments are avoided.
