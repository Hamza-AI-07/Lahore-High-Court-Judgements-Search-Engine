ALI ZIA BAJWA, J.:-  Through this constitutional 
petition, filed under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic 
of Pakistan, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Constitution’), read with 
Section 491 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 (hereinafter referred to 
as ‘the Code’), the petitioner sought the indulgence of this Court for the 
recovery of her grandson, namely Ghulam Murtaza (hereinafter ‘the 
detenu’) aged eleven years from the alleged illegal custody of respondent 
No. 3, Hassan Abbas.  

(2) 
Writ Petition No.40169/2024 
 
2. 
The detenu was presented before this Court by the Station 
House Officer, Police Station Dinga, District Gujrat, who apprised the 
Court that he (the detenu) was implicated in a theft case. It was further 
conveyed that, following the provisions of the Juvenile Justice System Act, 
2018 (hereinafter referred to as ‘The Juvenile Act’), the detenu has been 
released on a surety bond. The detenu appeared in a pitiable condition, 
seemingly falling squarely within the definition of a ‘destitute and 
neglected child’ as delineated under Section 1(k) of The Punjab Destitute 
and Neglected Children Act, 2004 (hereinafter referred to as ‘The Child 
Act’). His custody was handed over to the Child Protection and Welfare 
Bureau, Punjab. A report filed by the Superintendent of Police 
(Investigation) of District Gujrat revealed that the detenu has five other 
siblings. Both the detenu and his brother, Ahmed, are involved in criminal 
activities with the active knowledge of the petitioner and their mother, 
Nabeeha. The younger sister of detenu, Shaheen Fatima, was also presented 
before the Court, suffering severely from skin diseases on her head. The 
custody of the neglected and destitute minors, Ahmed and Shaheen Fatima, 
was also entrusted to the Child Protection and Welfare Bureau, Punjab.  
3. 
Reports of the concerned quarters indicate a disturbing lack of 
effort to properly implement The Juvenile Act. The learned Law Officers, 
representing both the Federal and Provincial Governments, unequivocally 
submit that their respective departments are ready to fulfill their obligations 
under The Juvenile Act to ensure its effective implementation. 
4. 
At the heart of our criminal justice system, the treatment of 
child offenders should be guided by a reformative approach. These young 
individuals, often led astray by difficult circumstances, deserve a chance to 
find their way back to normal life and become valuable members of society. 
By focusing on reformation rather than punishment, we address the root 
causes of their behaviour. We give them the tools they need to succeed and 
prevent them from returning to a life of crime. Each child reformed is a 
success for our community, showing that with the right support, everyone 
can change for the better. To quote Nelson Mandela, ‘There can be no 
keener revelation of a society’s soul than the way in which it treats its 
children.’ 

(3) 
Writ Petition No.40169/2024 
 
5. 
International law strongly advocates for a reformative 
approach while dealing with child offenders. The United Nations 
Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), the UN Standard 
Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice (Beijing Rules, 
1985), and the Guidelines for the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency 
(Riyadh Guidelines, 1990) are key international legal instruments that bind 
Pakistan to ensure the proper treatment and protection of juvenile 
offenders. These instruments require Pakistan to uphold the rights of 
children, prioritize their rehabilitation over punishment, and implement 
measures to prevent juvenile delinquency. The UNCRC is a comprehensive 
human rights treaty that outlines the civil, political, economic, social, 
health, and cultural rights of children. Adopted by the United Nations 
General Assembly on November 20, 1989, the UNCRC is the most widely 
ratified human rights treaty in history, highlighting the global commitment 
to the well-being and protection of children. Pakistan is a signatory to the 
UNCRC, having ratified the treaty on December 12, 1990. Pakistan, as a 
signatory to several international treaties and conventions, has specific 
responsibilities regarding the treatment of child offenders. The primary 
international instruments that shape Pakistan’s obligations include the 
UNCRC and its associated protocols. 
6. 
It took over a decade for Pakistan to promulgate its first 
exclusive law dealing with juvenile offenders. This landmark legislation, 
the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance of 2000 (JJSO), was enacted in July 
2000. The JJSO served as the cornerstone of juvenile justice in Pakistan, 
providing a framework for the treatment and rehabilitation of young 
offenders. However, as global perspectives on juvenile justice evolved, the 
need for more comprehensive legislation became obvious. On May 24, 
2018, Pakistan ushered in a new era with the enactment of The Juvenile 
Act. This Act replaced the JJSO, marking a renewed commitment to the 
protection and rehabilitation of juvenile offenders. The Juvenile Act builds 
upon the foundations laid by the JJSO, incorporating modern principles of 
juvenile justice and ensuring alignment with international standards. It 
emphasizes the importance of rehabilitation over punishment, education 
over incarceration, and the inherent worth and potential of every child. With 

(4) 
Writ Petition No.40169/2024 
 
The Juvenile Act, Pakistan has reaffirmed its dedication to nurturing its 
younger citizens, offering them hope and a pathway to a brighter future. 
The Juvenile Act harmonizes the legal framework of Pakistan with the 
principles outlined in key international instruments, emphasizing 
protection, dignity, and the opportunity for reform. It would be pertinent to 
take a comprehensive overview of the dynamic provisions within The 
Juvenile Act to fully grasp the legal framework it establishes. 
Legal Assistance at State Expense  
7. 
 
Every juvenile offender or a victim child of an offence is 
entitled to legal assistance at the expense of the State. Within twenty-four 
hours of being taken into custody, a juvenile must be informed of his legal 
rights by a legal practitioner. The legal practitioner, appointed by the 
relevant Provincial Government department or the Juvenile court to assist 
the child victim or juvenile offender, must have a minimum of seven years 
of experience at the Bar.1 It provides legal assistance not only to a child 
who is a victim of an offence but also to a child who is accused. This 
provision ensures state-funded legal assistance for juveniles, both victims 
and accused, informing them of their legal rights within twenty-four hours 
of custody. It requires appointed lawyers to have at least seven years of 
experience, aiming to protect rights, ensure justice, comply with 
international standards, prevent wrongful convictions, and uphold a fair, 
child-sensitive legal process. 
Constitution of Juvenile Courts 
8. 
 
Under Section 4 of The Juvenile Act the Prime Minister, in 
consultation with the concerned High Court, shall establish or designate 
Juvenile Courts within three months of the commencement of this Act, as 
notified in the official Gazette. These courts may serve one or more 
Sessions Divisions, and trials may be held at locations specified by the High 
Court. Judges appointed to Juvenile Courts must be Sessions Judges, 
Additional Sessions Judges, Judicial Magistrates with the powers of 
Section 30 of the Code or practicing advocates with at least ten years at the 
 
1 Section 3 of The Juvenile Act  

(5) 
Writ Petition No.40169/2024 
 
Bar, appointed under the terms set by the Prime Minister in consultation 
with the High Court. Juvenile Courts have exclusive jurisdiction over cases 
where a juvenile is accused of an offence. All such pending cases at other 
trial courts will be transferred to the appropriate Juvenile Court upon the 
commencement of The Juvenile Act. Changes in the court’s composition 
or case transfers will not necessitate recalling or re-hearing witnesses; 
existing evidence remains valid. 
9. 
 
The Juvenile Court is mandated to decide cases within six 
months of taking cognizance. If unable to meet this deadline, the court must 
seek an extension from the High Court, explaining the delay. Failing this, 
the complainant or juvenile may apply to the High Court for an extension. 
Additionally, the Juvenile Court may hold sittings at locations different 
from those used by ordinary courts for other trials. The purpose of holding 
Juvenile Court sittings at different locations from ordinary courts is to 
create a less intimidating environment for juveniles. This reduces the stress 
and anxiety of court proceedings, fostering a setting conducive to 
rehabilitation and fair treatment. It ensures sensitivity to the unique needs 
of juveniles, promoting a justice system that prioritizes their well-being and 
reintegration into society. 
The Process of the Arrest of a Juvenile  
10. 
 
Under Section 5 of The Juvenile Act upon the arrest of a 
juvenile, he must be kept in an observation home. The officer-in-charge of 
the police station is required to promptly inform the juvenile’s guardian, if 
available, of the arrest, including the time, date, and name of the Juvenile 
Court where the juvenile will be presented. Additionally, the officer must 
notify the concerned probation officer to gather information about the 
juvenile and relevant circumstances to assist the Juvenile Court in its 
inquiry. No juvenile shall be arrested under preventive detention laws or 
the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Code. Furthermore, the report under 
Section 173 of the Code must detail the steps taken by the officer-in-charge 
to refer the case to the Juvenile Justice Committee for diversion, as 
envisaged by Section 9 of The Juvenile Act.  

(6) 
Writ Petition No.40169/2024 
 
11. 
 
The purpose of this provision is to ensure that juvenile 
offenders are kept and treated separately from the ordinary criminal justice 
system and offenders. This separation aims to protect the unique needs and 
vulnerabilities of the juveniles, providing them with an environment and 
processes that focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment. It seeks to 
prevent juveniles from being exposed to the potentially harmful influences 
of adult offenders and to promote their reintegration into society as 
responsible individuals. This approach emphasizes a justice system that is 
tailored to the developmental and psychological needs of young offenders, 
fostering their growth and positive transformation. 
Special Investigation Mechanism   
12. 
 
As per Section 7 of The Juvenile Act, a juvenile must be 
interrogated by a police officer of at least the rank of Sub Inspector, under 
the supervision of a Superintendent of Police or an SDPO. The 
investigation officer shall be assisted by a probation officer or a 
government-designated social welfare officer. Together, they will prepare a 
social investigation report, which will be attached to the report prepared 
under Section 173 of the Code. The purpose of this arrangement is to ensure 
that the investigation of juvenile is conducted with appropriate oversight 
and support. By involving higher-ranking police officers and having the 
assistance of probation or social welfare officers, the process aims to be 
thorough, fair, and sensitive to the juvenile’s circumstances. The social 
investigation report helps to provide a comprehensive understanding of the 
juvenile’s background, which is essential for informed decision-making 
and promoting the juvenile’s rehabilitation. 
Arrest and Probation of Female Juvenile Offenders  
13. 
 
Under no circumstances can a female juvenile be apprehended 
or investigated by a male police officer, nor shall she be released on 
probation under the supervision of a male officer. Furthermore, a female 
juvenile shall only be housed in a Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre that is 
established or certified exclusively for female inmates.2 The purpose of 
 
2 Section 17 of The Juvenile Act 

(7) 
Writ Petition No.40169/2024 
 
these provisions is to ensure the safety, dignity, and well-being of female 
juveniles within the criminal justice system. By prohibiting male officers 
from apprehending, investigating, or supervising female juveniles, it aims 
to prevent any potential abuse, harassment, or discomfort that might arise 
from interactions with male officers. Additionally, by mandating that 
female juveniles be kept in rehabilitation centers exclusively for female 
inmates, it seeks to provide a more secure and supportive environment 
tailored to their specific needs. 
Constitution of Juvenile Justice Committee 
14. 
 
Under Section 10 of The Juvenile Act, upon the 
commencement of this Act, and not later than three months thereafter, the 
Law and Justice Division, in consultation with the concerned Sessions 
Judge, shall establish a Juvenile Justice Committee for each Sessions 
Division. This committee will be comprised of four members: a serving 
Judicial Magistrate with powers under Section 30 of the Code, who will 
head the committee; the district Public Prosecutor; a member of the local 
Bar with at least seven years of standing, appointed by the Sessions Judge 
for a term of two years; and a serving probation officer or social welfare 
officer not below the rank of BPS-17. This composition aims to ensure a 
balanced and just approach to juvenile justice system. The purpose of the 
Juvenile Justice Committee is to oversee and ensure the fair treatment and 
rehabilitation of juvenile offenders. By bringing together a Judicial 
Magistrate, District Public Prosecutor, an experienced Bar member, and a 
probation or social welfare officer, the committee aims to provide a 
comprehensive and balanced approach to juvenile justice system.  
This multidisciplinary team works to ensure that juvenile cases are handled 
with the necessary legal oversight, prosecutorial guidance, legal advocacy, 
and social support, ultimately developing an environment conducive to the 
rehabilitation and reintegration of juvenile offenders into society. 
15. 
 
The Juvenile Justice Committee, ideally located within the 
same premises as the Juvenile Court, plays a vital role in the juvenile justice 
system. It handles case diversions referred by the police, prosecution, or 
Juvenile Court, aiming to resolve them within a month. The committee also 

(8) 
Writ Petition No.40169/2024 
 
inspects observation homes and Juvenile Rehabilitation Centres, issuing 
directives to enhance the welfare and social reintegration of juveniles. 
Additionally, it performs other prescribed functions, with the Sessions 
Judge of each District providing the necessary staff for its effective 
administration and functioning. This setup ensures a balanced and 
rehabilitative approach to juvenile justice system. 
Disposal of Cases through Diversion  
16. 
 
Diversion measures are innovative approaches designed to 
resolve legal cases without formal judicial proceedings, steering offenders 
away from traditional criminal justice system towards rehabilitation and 
reintegration programs. These measures aim to tackle the root causes of 
criminal behaviour, offering supportive interventions to prevent future 
offenses. Key elements include counselling and therapy to address 
behavioural issues, mental health problems, and substance abuse. 
Community service allows offenders to give back to society, fostering a 
sense of positive contribution. Educational programs provide valuable 
skills and knowledge, enhancing employability and lawful conduct. 
Restorative justice programs promote accountability and amends through 
mediation between offenders and victims. Probation or supervised release 
provides an alternative to incarceration, ensuring compliance with specific 
conditions. Youth diversion programs focus on mentorship, family support, 
and education, guiding juveniles away from criminal behaviour towards 
personal growth and societal harmony. 
17. 
 
According to Section 9 of The Juvenile Act disposal of cases 
through diversion allows for certain juvenile cases to be resolved outside 
the traditional judicial process with the consent of the juveniles or their 
guardians. Diversion is applicable for all the juveniles accused of minor 
offenses or in cases involving major offenses, if they are under sixteen at 
the time of the offense. For diversion cases can be referred to the Juvenile 
Justice Committee, which handles the case through diversionary methods. 
Diversion can occur at any stage of police investigation or trial. When the 
police refer a case to the Juvenile Justice Committee, the required police 
report under Section 173 of the Code is postponed until the Committee 

(9) 
Writ Petition No.40169/2024 
 
issues its final order. The Committee, with the victim’s consent, may use 
various diversion methods, including restitution of movable property, 
reparation of damages, written or oral apologies, community service, fines, 
costs of proceedings, placement in a Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre, or 
written and oral reprimands. If the complainant is a state functionary and 
the offense does not involve a private individual, the case can still be 
diverted with the consent of the public prosecutor. All offenses, whether 
minor or major, are deemed compoundable for diversion purposes.  
Special Procedure of Juvenile Court 
18. 
 
Section 11 lays down that the Juvenile Court shall adhere to 
the procedures outlined in the Code unless otherwise specified by The 
Juvenile Act. Only specific individuals may be present at court sessions: 
the court staff and officers, parties to the case and those directly involved, 
the juvenile’s guardian, and others as directed by the court. The court may 
order individuals to withdraw to protect the juvenile’s decency or morality. 
If the court determines that the juvenile’s presence is not essential at any 
point, it may proceed without the juvenile. Should a juvenile be found 
suffering from a serious illness, the court will ensure he receives necessary 
treatment at a hospital or medical institution, with the costs covered by the 
State. The purpose of these provisions is to ensure that the proceedings of 
the Juvenile Court are conducted in a manner that prioritizes the well-being 
and dignity of the juvenile. By restricting attendance to essential personnel 
and individuals directly involved in the case, the law aims to create a more 
private and less intimidating environment. This helps to protect the 
juvenile’s privacy and fosters a sense of security. 
19. 
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 239 of the Code or 
any other prevailing law, a juvenile shall not be charged or tried for an 
offense alongside an adult. However, the Juvenile Court may permit a joint 
trial if it deems such an arrangement to be in the interests of justice. In case 
of joint trial, the court may waive the juvenile’s physical presence, allowing 
participation through audio-visual technology. The purpose of these 
provisions is to protect juveniles from the potentially negative influences 
and pressures of being tried alongside adults. By generally prohibiting joint 

(10) 
Writ Petition No.40169/2024 
 
trials with adults, the law aims to ensure that juveniles receive special 
consideration and treatment appropriate to their age and developmental 
stage.  
20. 
 
It must be kept in mind that the general rule under the law 
mandates separate trials for juveniles and adult offenders. However, the law 
provides an exception that if the court is satisfied that a joint trial serves the 
interest of justice, it may proceed accordingly. ‘If the court is satisfied’ 
connotes that the court has reviewed the circumstances and facts and has 
determined that a joint trial is appropriate and justifiable. It indicates that 
the court has exercised its judgment and discretion to reach a decision based 
on the interest of justice and fairness. When a court orders a joint trial, 
deviating from the general rule of separate trial for juvenile and adult, it 
must provide compelling reasons that demonstrate the careful application 
of judicial discretion. 
The Anonymity of Name and Identity 
21. 
 
Under Section 13 of The Juvenile Act, subject to the 
exceptions as provided in this Section, any person who prints or publishes 
the name or any information that could reveal the identity of a juvenile shall 
be subject to imprisonment for a term of up to three years and shall also be 
liable to a fine. Furthermore, anyone who prints or publishes any 
information regarding proceedings before a Juvenile Court, about a 
juvenile, without prior permission from the Juvenile Court, shall be 
punished with imprisonment for a term of up to two years and shall also be 
liable to a fine. The law aims to prevent potential harm, stigma, or undue 
attention that could negatively impact the juvenile’s future. This protection 
ensures that juveniles can navigate the legal process without fear of public 
exposure, fostering a rehabilitative rather than punitive approach to juvenile 
justice system.  
The Report of Probation Officer  
22. 
 
Section 14 of The Juvenile Act mandates that the probation 
officer, upon the direction of the Juvenile Court, shall assist and prepare a 
report within the specified time regarding the juvenile’s character, 

(11) 
Writ Petition No.40169/2024 
 
educational, social, and moral background; any voluntary admission of 
committing an offense; evidence of the juvenile’s involvement in the 
offense; the legal assistance provided to the juvenile and their family; steps 
taken towards mediation or compromise with the complainant or victim; 
and the possibility of sending the juveniles to a Juvenile Rehabilitation 
Centre or releasing them on probation. The report of the probation officer 
is to be treated as confidential, except where the Juvenile Court deems it 
appropriate to communicate its substance to the juvenile’s guardian. If the 
guardians dispute the contents of the report, the juvenile court may allow 
them an opportunity to present relevant evidence. 
23. 
 
The purpose of such a report is to provide the Juvenile Court 
with a comprehensive understanding of the juvenile’s background and 
circumstances. This information aids the juvenile court in making 
informed, fair, and just decisions that prioritize the juvenile’s rehabilitation 
and reintegration into society, rather than mere punishment. It ensures that 
the court considers the juvenile’s overall well-being, potential for reform, 
and the best interests of both the juvenile and society. 
Establishment and Certification of Observation Homes and Juvenile 
Rehabilitation Centres   
24. 
 
Under Section 20 of The Juvenile Act the Interior Division, in 
consultation with the concerned Division, may establish and maintain 
observation homes and Juvenile Rehabilitation Centres for the reception of 
juveniles, including separate facilities for female juveniles. Additionally, 
the Interior Division may certify observation homes or Juvenile 
Rehabilitation Centres managed by non-governmental organizations for 
juvenile reception. Furthermore, the Interior Division may certify 
established associations or societies within local areas for the social 
reintegration or rehabilitation of juvenile offenders released on parole or 
discharged from a Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre. The Division is also 
empowered to regulate the activities and functions of such released or 
discharged juveniles in the prescribed manner. According to Section 22 of 
The Juvenile Act, in order to report to the juvenile court or Juvenile Justice 
Committee on measures for social reintegration, health, education, and 

(12) 
Writ Petition No.40169/2024 
 
other conditions of the inmates, a member of the Juvenile Justice 
Committee along with a medical officer may inspect an observation home 
or a Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre. This inspection requires prior approval 
from the head of the Committee, or an officer authorized by the relevant 
Provincial Government department.  
25. 
 
Unfortunately, The Juvenile Act has not been implemented in 
its true letter and spirit. This landmark legislation, designed to bring justice 
to a child victims and rehabilitation of juvenile offenders, remains more a 
promise than a reality. Its vision of Specialized Juvenile Courts, 
compassionate legal assistance, and rehabilitative measures have been 
dimmed by inadequate execution. The Juvenile Justice Committees, 
envisioned to protect the welfare and facilitate the social reintegration of 
young offenders, have unfortunately failed to become operational and 
fulfill the commendable objectives for which The Juvenile Act was enacted. 
The goals of protecting juveniles from harsh penalties and ensuring their 
dignified treatment have been undermined by systemic inefficiencies and a 
persistent gap between policy and practice. The failure of implementation 
of The Juvenile Act to be fully realized leaves many young lives still 
ensnared in the criminal justice system that struggles to provide the care 
and opportunity they deserve. 
26. 
 
Law is not merely a formality; it is an obligation, a compulsion 
that ensures order and justice within society. The written statutes and 
regulations are more than ink on paper. The enforcement of a statute is not 
optional, but a mandatory duty entrusted to every state functionary, a 
responsibility that comes with the authority and power vested in their 
positions. This duty is not just about compliance rather it is about upholding 
the rule of law. The failure to implement the law results in a grave violation 
of the fundamental rights of those subject to it. However, when these laws 
are not enforced, the vulnerable are left unshielded, and their rights 
trampled upon. When laws are not implemented, resulting in the violation 
of the rights of those whom the law seeks to protect, the state functionaries 
responsible for this negligence must be held accountable. To turn a blind 
eye to the breach of these laws is to let the very foundation of justice 
crumble beneath our feet. Accountability must be the order of the day, 

(13) 
Writ Petition No.40169/2024 
 
ensuring that those entrusted with the power to enforce the law do not shirk 
their responsibilities. Justice delayed is justice denied, and every state 
functionary who fails to implement the law is complicit in this denial. 
27. 
 
The reports submitted by the concerned state functionaries 
reveal a disheartening situation. No serious effort whatsoever was made to 
implement The Juvenile Act. Such inaction on the part of state functionaries 
suggests that the Government is dragging its feet on a beneficial piece of 
legislation. The Juvenile Act, like many other laws, remained merely a 
paper law, with its noble intentions never translating into meaningful 
action. 
28. 
 
Both executive agencies and Courts in Pakistan are 
constitutionally and legally bound to uphold the rule of law within their 
respective domains.3 This obligation is critical to maintaining justice, 
ensuring fairness, and protecting the rights of individuals. When a law is 
not implemented, the duty of the Constitutional Court encompasses several 
key actions. It undertakes judicial scrutiny, issues enforcement orders, 
protects Constitutional rights, holds government officials accountable, and 
prescribes remedial measures. Through these actions, the Court ensures that 
laws are not merely words on paper but are actively upheld and enforced, 
preserving the integrity of the legal system. In the above-discussed 
circumstances, this Court is compelled to issue the following directions to 
ensure the prompt implementation of The Juvenile Act:- 
I. 
The respective Government must take immediate and decisive 
steps to implement The Juvenile Act to the fullest extent and 
meaning without further delay. It is imperative that no further 
time is wasted in bringing the protections and reforms of this 
vital legislation to fruition. For the greater good of our youth, 
we must ensure that the commitments of this law are swiftly 
and fully realized.  
II. 
The Provincial Police Officer shall ensure that a juvenile 
offender shall be interrogated only by a police officer of a rank 
not below that of a Sub-Inspector. Such interrogation shall be 
 
3 Dr. Arslan Iftikhar vs. Malik Riaz Hussain and Others- PLD 2012 SC 903 

(14) 
Writ Petition No.40169/2024 
 
carried out under the supervision of a Superintendent of Police 
(SP) or a Sub-Divisional Police Officer (SDPO). The 
investigating officer shall be assisted by a probation officer or 
a social welfare officer notified by the Government.  
III. 
The Prosecutor General Punjab, as a principal stakeholder in 
the criminal justice system, must also ensure the strict 
compliance of The Juvenile Act. It is incumbent upon the 
concerned prosecutors to promptly identify and address any 
investigation conducted in violation of this law at the earliest 
possible stage. By doing so, they safeguard the integrity of the 
legal process and uphold the rights and protections afforded to 
juveniles under this beneficial legislation.  
IV. 
To achieve the true purpose of The Juvenile Act, it is essential 
to always opt for the disposal of cases through diversion 
following Section 9 of this Act. Diversion focuses on 
rehabilitation 
over 
punishment, 
reducing 
recidivism, 
minimizing stigma, improving efficiency in the justice system, 
and prioritizing the best interests and well-being of the juvenile 
offenders. During the investigation, the investigating agency, 
and during the trial, the prosecution and trial courts shall refer 
cases to the Juvenile Justice Committees for disposal through 
diversion in the prescribed manner.  
V. 
To ensure strict compliance with The Juvenile Act during 
investigations, the prosecution and investigating agency must 
maintain a close and effective liaison. This cooperation is 
essential to guarantee that juvenile offenders are treated in full 
accordance with the provisions of the Act, upholding both the 
spirit and letter of the law. 
VI. 
The Law and Justice Division, in consultation with the 
Sessions Judge, shall bring forth the Juvenile Justice 
Committee in each Sessions Division without slightest delay to 
ensure effective and meaningful implementation of The 
Juvenile Act. Without these committees being operational, the 
true spirit of this law cannot be fully realized. 

(15) 
Writ Petition No.40169/2024 
 
VII. 
To meet the requirements of The Juvenile Act, arrested 
juveniles shall be kept in observation homes. The Government 
shall establish these observation homes to provide safe shelter 
for them in every District. The physical separation of juveniles 
from adult offenders in detention facilities is non-negotiable, 
with separate lockups and detention centers dedicated to young 
offenders. 
VIII. 
Prosecutors and investigating officers must be thoroughly 
versed in the provisions and their applications within The 
Juvenile Act. It is advisable to hold training sessions for them 
in collaboration with the Prosecution and Police Departments. 
This proactive approach will ensure that all involved parties are 
fully equipped to uphold the law and administer justice 
following the mandates of the law.  
29. 
 
The effective implementation of The Juvenile Act requires a 
multi-faceted approach involving all stakeholders. By adhering to the 
provision of this Act, we can ensure a criminal justice system that is fair, 
humane, and geared towards the rehabilitation of juvenile offenders. A copy 
of this judgment shall be transmitted through the Registrar’s office of this 
Court to all stakeholders, including the Sessions Judges and Juvenile Courts, 
for its strict compliance. The compliance reports shall be filed by the 
Government, Prosecutor General Punjab and Provincial Police Officer, 
Punjab within two months to the Registrar’s office of this Court for perusal in 
chambers. 
30.
