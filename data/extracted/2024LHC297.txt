Sultan Tanvir Ahmad, J:-Through this 
judgment the captioned constitution petition as well as the 
petitions detailed in schedule „A‟, having common questions of 
law and facts, shall be decided. The petitioners are aggrieved 
from the complaints filed by the financial institutions under 
section 20 of the Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) 
Ordinance, 2001 (the „Ordinance‟) pending before various 
learned Banking Courts (the „Banking Courts‟). The 
petitioners are seeking to stay of proceedings in the criminal 
complaints, inter alia, on the common ground that criminal 
proceedings 
under 
the 
Ordinance 
cannot 
proceed 
simultaneously with the civil proceedings.  
02. 
In the captioned case, the petitioners have 
challenged the criminal complaint No. 09/2023 filed on 
04.04.2023 by National Bank of Pakistan. The suit filed by the 
bank under section 9 of the Ordinance, has already been 

 
 
Writ Petition No.38033 of 2023  
 
 
 
4 
decreed and presently RFA No. 58448/2022 against the 
judgment and decree dated 23.05.2022 is pending adjudication. 
It is alleged in the complaint that the petitioners have 
committed breach of letters of pledge, hypothecation and other 
security documents as well as they have made false 
representation to obtain finance facility. 
03.  
Mr. Muhammad Imran Malik-learned ASC, 
on behalf of the petitioners, has submitted that the remedy of 
criminal complaint, as contemplated in the Ordinance, is 
dependent upon fulfillment of obligations and / or 
determination of liability at the civil side. Learned counsel has 
stated that the intent of legislature is clear from wording of 
section 20(1)(a) of the Ordinance, which provides that a 
customer can be held responsible for criminal liability only 
when he commits dishonest breach of the terms of instruments 
narrated therein. He has stated that section 20(1)(b) of the 
Ordinance also makes the criminal liability dependent on 
breach of obligation; that section 3 of the Ordinance 
determines the duty of customer and as per the same, duty only 
arises when the obligations are determined or a judgment at 
civil side is passed against a customer. It is further submitted 
that the provisions of the Ordinance are very much clear that 
remedy of filing of criminal complaint under section 20 of the 

 
 
Writ Petition No.38033 of 2023  
 
 
 
5 
Ordinance is dependent upon non-fulfillment of obligation(s) 
with respect to finance facility and use of word judgment in 
section 3 of the Ordinance means that unless default is 
determined, the criminal proceedings cannot be initiated. Mr. 
Muhammad Imran Malik, in course of arguments, has 
repeatedly relied upon the judgment in case titled “Messrs 
Long Grain Rice Mills (Pvt.) Ltd. through Chief Executive vs. 
Habib Bank Limited through Senior Manager (CAD) and 
Senior Manager (Remedial) and another” (2016 CLD 551). 
Learned counsel for the petitioners has further made reference 
to cases titled “Akhlaq Hussain Kayani vs. Zafar Iqbal Kiyani 
and others” (2010 SCMR 1835), “Miraj Khan vs. Gul Ahmed 
and 3 others” (2000 SCMR 122) and “Abdul Haleem vs. The 
State and others” (1982 SCMR 988). 
04. 
On the other hand, Mr. Tariq Kamal Qazi- 
learned counsel for the financial institutions has relied on cases 
titled “Dr. Sher Afgan Khan Niazi vs. Ali S. Habib and others” 
(2011 SCMR 1813) and “Muhammad Aslam vs. The State and 
others” (2017 SCMR 390) and he has stated that merely for 
the reason that civil suit is filed, the criminal proceedings     
can neither be quashed nor they can put to halt in the 
constitutional jurisdiction, without first availing the remedies 
provided   under the law. He has further argued that where 

 
 
Writ Petition No.38033 of 2023  
 
 
 
6 
alleged crime is unavoidably dependent on the civil liability, 
the Banking Courts are sufficiently permitted by law to 
postpone the criminal proceedings and there is no wisdom in 
laying down any general principle for the cases involving 
different facts as the law has already empowered the Banking 
Courts to make a decision in this regard, keeping in view the 
facts of the separate cases. He has added that unlike torts and 
contracts, the criminal law is a branch of public law and 
although the direct and immediate victim of a crime is 
typically a private party but it always causes social harm and 
whole community is indirectly affected from the same; that in 
most of the jurisdictions the criminal proceedings, since having 
direct nexus and harm to the society, are given precedence 
over the civil proceedings, if arises out of the same set of facts. 
Mr. Shoaib Rasheed-learned ASC, has read various provisions 
of the Ordinance and he has argued that the stance adopted by 
the petitioners and interpretation of the provisions put forth is 
incorrect. He has stated that section 3(2) of the Ordinance 
specifically provides that the customer in default, is liable to 
pay the cost of funds in addition to the default amount, apart 
from such other civil and criminal liabilities, which is 
meaningful. 
05.  
Syed Moazam Ali Shah-learned ASC, while 

 
 
Writ Petition No.38033 of 2023  
 
 
 
7 
relying upon the historical background of banking laws, has 
argued that the Ordinance has been promulgated to provide 
speedy remedy; that substantial compliance of section 13 of 
the Ordinance is not taking place, causing damage to both 
borrowers and financial institutions; that the relief sought in 
the petitions will defeat the very object of the Ordinance. 
Barrister Syed Ali Rizvi, has argued that the constitutional 
jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked without first 
availing the statutory, legal and efficacious remedy available to 
the petitioners before the Banking Courts. He contended that 
this omission or failure to avail such remedy before invoking 
the constitutional jurisdiction would attribute redundancy to 
spirit, scheme, provisions and process set by the legislature in 
the Ordinance and Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 (Cr.P.C). 
He has shown his concern about opening of floodgate of 
litigation, whereby, the parties can simply ignore the provision 
and scheme of law, by directly invoking the constitutional 
jurisdiction of this Court. Mr. Hfeez Saeed Akhtar-learned 
ASC referred to case titled “Central Board of Revenue and 
another vs. Khan Muhammad” (PLD 1986 SC 192) and 
argued that the Honourable Supreme Court refused to stay the 
criminal proceedings despite pendency of the civil  litigation in 
a case arising out of the Customs Act, 1969 and  observed that 
both are independent of each other. He further relied on “Malik 

 
 
Writ Petition No.38033 of 2023  
 
 
 
8 
Khuda Bakhsh vs. The State” (1995 SCMR 1621), “Mauj Din 
through Legal Heirs and others vs. Settlement Commissioner, 
Lahore Division and others” (2002 SCMR 2001), “Seema 
Fareed and others vs. The State and another” (2008 SCMR 
839) and various other judgments. It is submitted that in the 
context of offences defined in section 2(g)(ii) and (iii) read 
with section 20 of the Ordinance element of civil default is not 
necessary to be determined before criminal proceedings. He 
further relied upon the judgments given by the Courts of the 
neighboring countries and argued that precedence is being 
given to criminal cases. 
06. 
I have heard the arguments of the learned 
counsel for the parties. Documents relied by the parties have 
been perused.   
07. 
A learned full bench of this Court in 
judgment reported as “Mian Ayaz Anwar and Others Versus 
State Bank of Pakistan and Others” (2019 CLD 375) and 
another learned Bench in case titled “Misbah Ud Din Zaigham 
and 03 Others Versus Federal Investigation Agency through 
Assistant Director (FIA/CBC/LHR) and another” (2021 CLD 
906) have already dealt with the cases that involve willful 
default within the scope of section 2(g)(i) of the Ordinance. 
The present petitions relate to the cases in which willful default 

 
 
Writ Petition No.38033 of 2023  
 
 
 
9 
as defined by section 2(g)(ii) & (iii) of the Ordinance is 
alleged and complaints under relevant sub-sections of section 
20 of the Ordinance are pending.  
08. 
It is apt to start with the provisions forming 
the basic dispute between the contestants. 
 
2(g) “Willful default” means— 
(i) 
deliberate or intentional failure 
to repay any finance, loan, 
advance 
or 
any 
financial 
assistance 
received 
by 
any 
person 
from 
a 
financial 
institution after such payment 
has become due under the terms 
of any law or an agreement, 
rules or regulations issued by 
the State Bank of Pakistan; 
(ii) 
utilization of finance, loan, 
advance or financial assistance 
or a substantial part thereof, 
obtained by any person from a 
financial 
institution 
for 
a 
purpose other than that for 
which 
such 
finance, 
loan, 
advance or financial assistance 
had been obtained and payment 
in part or full not made to the 
financial institution; or 
(iii) removal, 
transfer, 
misappropriation or sale of any 
assets collateralized to secure a 
finance, 
loan, 
advance 
or 
financial assistance obtained 
from a financial institution 
without permission of such 
institution.

Section 2(g)(ii) of the Ordinance primarily 
relates to utilization of finance facility for a purpose other than 
for which this facility is obtained. Similarly, removal or 
transfer, 
misappropriation 
or 
sale 
of 
collaterals, 
as 
contemplated in section 2(g)(iii) of the Ordinance, can 
constitute willful default when the same takes place without 
permission of the financial institution. A reading of above 

 
 
Writ Petition No.38033 of 2023  
 
 
 
12 
highlighted part of section 20 of the Ordinance reveals that 
whoever, commits offence as envisaged in section 20(1)(a) to 
(c) of the Ordinance can be punished under said provision 
without prejudice to any other action which may be taken 
against him under the Ordinance. Punishment for section 
20(1)(d) of the Ordinance is visibly dependent upon 
determination of civil liability / decree. The petitioners-side 
has tried to take support of section 3 of the Ordinance and 
stated that duty of customers depends on default in obligation, 
however, sub-section 2 of this provision provides that where a 
customer defaults in obligation, he shall be liable to pay, for 
the period from his default …., apart from other civil and 
criminal liabilities that he may incur under the contract or 
rules or any other law for the time being in force.  
10. 
In “Mian Ayaz Anwar” case (supra), learned 
Full Bench of this Court observed that section 2(g)(ii) & (iii) 
of the Ordinance provide independent offences, which are not 
dependent on determination of suit under section 9 of the 
Ordinance. It is further decided that in these cases, the criminal 
complaints under relevant parts of section 20 of the Ordinance, 
can proceed without determination of default to pay. It will be 
beneficial to reproduce paragraph No. 17 of the said judgment 
that reads:- 

 
 
Writ Petition No.38033 of 2023  
 
 
 
13 
 
 
“17. So far as the offences insection 
2(g)(ii) and (iii) of the FIO are concerned, 
they provide for independent offences which 
can be tried under section 20 of the FIO 
independent of any determination of a 
default in an obligation to pay. Neither 
offences are dependent on the civil liability 
„default‟ under section 9 of the FIO as they 
are offences due to the very act of the 
customer. So if a customer utilizes the 
finance 
obtained 
from 
a 
financial 
institution for purposes other than for 
which it was given for or if a customer 
removes, 
transfers 
or 
misappropriates 
collateral or security of the financial 
institution, then the act of such removal, 
transfer or misappropriation constitutes an 
offence for which criminal proceedings can 
be instituted under section 20 of the FIO. A 
lot has been argued with reference to the 
power given to a government agency for 
investigating into the offence of “willful 
default” under section 20(7). However, we 
find that the power is simply to investigate, 
that too on a complaint filed in writing by the 
Bank and after securing a thirty days‟ notice. 
Hence, it is neither unconstitutional nor 
excessive. The Banking Court being the 
special forum to try offences under the FIO is 
the proper forum to try the offence of willful 
default and in this regard in terms of the 
provisions of section 20(7) once the civil 
liability of default is established the offence 
of willfulness can be investigated by the FIA 
or any other nominated Federal Government 
Agency. Offences under section 2(g)(ii) and 
(iii) however are not dependent on the 
determination of the civil liability and can 
be investigated in terms of section 20(7) by 
the nominated government agency. In all 
such cases the Banking Court will try the 
offence of willful default as per section 20 
of the FIO.”

Federal Investment Agency and Others”(2017 SCMR 1218) 

 
 
Writ Petition No.38033 of 2023  
 
 
 
14 
case is relied by the petitioners but in my opinion, the 
judgment in the case does not advance support to their stance. 
The case was regarding trial of customer(s) under Offences in 
Respect of Banks (Special Courts) Ordinance, 1984 (ORBO). 
The Honourable Supreme Court ruled that ORBO would not 
apply to any act or omission which constitute an offence under 
the Ordinance. It has been observed that the Ordinance has 
overriding effect on anything inconsistent contained in any 
other law for time being in force. A learned Division Bench of 
Sindh High Court in case titled “Syed Wajahat Hussain Zaidi 
Versus Banking Court No. 1 and Others” (2018 CLD 1273), 
involving matter of selling hypothecated stocks, permitted the 
civil and criminal proceedings to proceed concurrently and 
observed as follows: 
 
 
“9. The submission of the learned 
counsel for the petitioner that when the 
Respondent Bank in Suit No. B-101 of 2013 
has, inter alia, sought judgment and decree 
for selling the hypothecated stocks, the 
criminal complaint No. 17 of 2014 filed on 
the allegation of selling the hypothecated 
stocks by the petitioner is not maintainable is 
totally misconceived. Bare reading of the 
Ordinance reveals that whenever the offence 
is committed in terms of Section 20, the 
Banking Court would take cognizance upon a 
complaint 
filed 
by 
authorized 
person. 
Moreover, it is settled principle of law that 
pendency of civil proceedings relating to 
same issue is not a bar to commencement or 
continuation of criminal proceedings and 
both can proceed concurrently as conviction 
for criminal offence is altogether a different 

 
 
Writ Petition No.38033 of 2023  
 
 
 
15 
matter from civil liability”. 
 
(Underlining added) 
 
12. 
 
The Supreme Court in various cases has 
considered the issue of co-existence of criminal and civil 
proceedings, in cases involving same set of transaction based 
on provisions of Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 and contractual 
civil liabilities. Both are treated as distinct and different. It is 
concluded that both can proceed concurrently because 
conviction for criminal cases is different from the civil 
liability. In the case titled “Seema Fareed and others” (supra), 
following has been observed:- 
 
 
“4. …. Interpretation placed by 
Honourable, Judge of the High Court on the 
provisions of the contract as well as the 
repealing statute does not suffer from any 
misconception of law or violation of the 
settled principles laid down by this Court. It 
is well-settled that, a criminal case must be 
allowed to proceed on its own merits and 
merely because civil proceedings relating to 
same transaction have been instituted it has 
never been considered to be a legal bar to 
the maintainability of criminal proceedings 
which can proceed concurrently because 
conviction 
for 
a 
criminal 
offence 
is 
altogether a different matter from the civil 
liability. While the spirit and purpose of 
criminal proceedings is to punish the 
offender for the commission of a crime the 
purpose behind the civil proceedings is to 
enforce civil rights arising out of contracts 
and in law both the proceedings can co-exist 
and proceed with simultaneously without any 
legal restriction.” 
 
 
 
 
Further reliance can be placed on case titled 

 
 
Writ Petition No.38033 of 2023  
 
 
 
16 
“Haji Sardar Khalid Saleem vs. Muhammad Ashraf and 
others” (2006 SCMR 1192) and “Muhammad Aslam vs. The 
State and others” (2017 SCMR 390). 
 
13. 
In course of arguments the question also 
came up for consideration that conclusion of criminal 
complaint can be fatal for the outcome of civil suit. Mr. Tariq 
Kamal Qazi, referred to Articles 54 to 57 of Qanun-e-Shahadat 
Order, 1984. This question has already been addressed in cases 
titled “The Deputy Inspector-General of Police Lahore and 
others vs. Anis-ur-Rehman Khan” (PLD 1985 SC 134) and 
“Karachi Transport Corporation and another vs. Muhammad 
Hanif and others” (2009 SCMR 1005). It has been decided 
that the standard of proof for both branches of law is altogether 
different. It is appropriate to reproduce the following part of 
“The Deputy Inspector-General of Police Lahore and Others” 
case (supra):- 
 
“The question of relevancy of judgment 
as was invoked in this case has been dealt 
with in sections 40 to 43 of the Evidence Act 
which 
have 
been 
subject-matter 
of 
consideration of this Court in two cases very 
recently. The one case is of Muhammad 
Azam v. Muhammad Iqbal and others (PLD 
1984 SC 95 and the other is a decision in 
original Appeal No. 192 of 1980 the 
judgment of which has yet to be published in 
the law reports. We can only reemphasize the 
statement of law on the subject in the 
following words in M. Monir‟s Commentary 
on the Evidence Act (Vol. I, p. 591) 

 
 
Writ Petition No.38033 of 2023  
 
 
 
17 
 
 
“A judgment of acquittal in a criminal 
case only decides that the accused had not 
been proved guilty of the offence with which 
he had been charged and to this extent only 
and no more, it is to be taken as correct and 
conclusive in a subsequent civil suit between 
the parties, the opinion and conclusions 
expressed in the judgment being otherwise 
irrelevant 
and 
inadmissible 
in 
such 
proceedings.” 
 
 
In the case before the Tribunal the 
judgment in the criminal case could be 
relevant only for reascertaining whether it 
was a judgment of conviction or acquittal 
and whether it was an honourable acquittal. 
The other opinions or findings, apart from 
these two, recorded or expressed in the 
judgment could not be utilised for unsettling 
the other proceedings. The extent to which 
the Tribunal utilized the judgment would be 
apparent not only from the passages 
reproduced from it but also the comments 
made on it…..” 
 
 
 
 
Further reference, if required, can be made to 
“Syed Askari Hadi Ali Augustine Imam and Anr. V. State 
(Delhi Admn.) and Anr.” (AIR 2009 SC 3232). 
14. 
Now I would like to take up the arguments 
that situation in some cases can be so that the customer may 
have bonafide claim regarding criminal liability being 
intimately or manifestly connected to the result of civil 
proceeding. Even if in some cases this rare situation emerges it 
cannot be desirable to lay any general principle and each case 
is then required to be examined on its facts. The Honourable 
Supreme Court in case titled “Salman Ashraf Versus 

 
 
Writ Petition No.38033 of 2023  
 
 
 
18 
Additional District Judge, Lahore and Others” (2023 SCMR 
1292) has already laid down a guideline for such 
circumstances, if at all arises. While it is observed that the 
object of civil proceedings is to enforce civil rights, whereas, 
criminal proceeding is to punish the offender for committing 
criminal offence and both even if relating to same matter can 
proceed simultaneously, it has also been recognized that the 
criminal courts are empowered to postpone the proceedings 
when criminal liability is intimately connected with the result 
of civil proceedings. It will be beneficial to reproduce the 
relevant extract from the judgment:- 
 
“…Although there is no bar to the 
simultaneous institution of both proceedings, 
the trial in the criminal proceeding may be 
stopped in certain circumstances. And the 
guiding principle in this regard is also well-
defined. It is that where the criminal 
liability is dependent upon or intimately 
connected with the result of the civil 
proceeding and it is difficult to draw a line 
between a bona fide claim and the criminal 
act alleged, the trial in the criminal 
proceeding may be postponed till the 
conclusion of the civil proceeding. Thus, 
where either of these two conditions is not 
fulfilled, i.e., where the subject matter of civil 
proceeding and that of criminal proceeding 
are distinct, not intimately connected, or 
where the civil proceeding is instituted mala 
fide to delay the criminal prosecution, not 
bona fide, the criminal proceeding may not 
be stayed.”

Writ Petition No.38033 of 2023  
 
 
 
19 
In this regard, learned Sindh High Court in case titled “The 
State Versus Illahi Bux and Others” (PLD 1965 (W.P.) 
Karachi 231) observed as under:- 
 
“But I do not think that it can be laid 
down as a general rule, that whenever an 
application is made for the postponement of 
a criminal proceeding upon the ground that 
the subject-matter is before a civil Court the 
criminal Court must necessarily reject that 
prayer upon the sole ground that the 
judgment of the civil Court will not be 
binding on it. Neither the answer by the Full 
Bench to the reference made to them, nor the 
judgment of Kaikaus, J. in the cases 
mentioned above lay down this proposition. 
The criminal Court is empowered under 
section 344 to adjourn the inquiry or trial 
upon a reasonable ground. Therefore when 
an application for adjournment upon the 
ground of the pendency of the civil suit upon 
the same subject-matter is made, the question 
which falls for consideration is whether it 
constitutes a reasonable ground. That, in my 
opinion, must be decided upon the facts of 
each 
case. 
The 
postponement 
of 
the 
proceedings is not a rule of law but a rule of 
prudence and in doing so the Court is guided 
by considerations of public interests. The 
interest of the complainant need not 
necessarily be the public interest. No hard 
and fast rule can be laid down. The decision 
must depend upon the nature of the case, the 
bona fides of the party moving the 
application for stay, the conduct of the 
complainant and his motive in so far as it can 
be ascertained, the desirability of avoiding 
long drawn out disputes of civil nature in two 
Courts side by side in competition with each 
other and similar other considerations. It is 
true that the decision of the civil Court would 
not bind the criminal Court but it may well 
be that when the parties have obtained an 
authoritative decision of the civil Court, they 

 
 
Writ Petition No.38033 of 2023  
 
 
 
20 
themselves might not like to press the matter 
further in the criminal Court. One of the 
considerations which has often weighed with 
the Court, though not decisive, is whether the 
criminal case had been instituted by the State 
or by a private party.” 
                          (Underlining is added) 
 
The Banking Courts in terms of section 7 of 
the Ordinance have same powers as are vested in a Court of 
Sessions under Cr.P.C and where the procedure is not provided 
in the Ordinance the provisions of the Cr.P.C. are applicable. 
Therefore, such power to adjourn or postpone is available to 
the Banking Courts which can be used with caution and 
remaining within the confines given in “Salman Ashraf” case 
(supra). Such order to postpone or to adjourn the proceedings 
cannot be made for indefinite period (“Muhammad Amin 
Versus Momin Khan and 2 Others - PLD 2014 Peshawar 49).  
15. 
In the titled case as well as the cases 
mentioned in Schedule „A‟ to this judgment the petitioners 
have approached this Court against the orders to summon the 
petitioners to face criminal proceedings and in some cases 
even prior to recording of cursory statement(s). The principle 
that the criminal and civil proceedings can be maintained 
simultaneously is well settled, as already discussed in detail. 
The learned counsel for the petitioners despite earnest effort 
could not convince as to availability of any reason for 
abridging powers of the Banking Courts or not following the 

 
 
Writ Petition No.38033 of 2023  
 
 
 
21 
normal procedure of law by the petitioners. I am of the 
considered opinion that no intervention in the proceedings of 
the criminal complaints, pending before the Banking Courts, is 
warranted. Consequently, the present petition along with the 
connected petitions are dismissed. No order as to costs.
