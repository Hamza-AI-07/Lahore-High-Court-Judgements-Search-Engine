Anwaar Hussain, J. The petitioners before this Court are 
persons, with special abilities and admittedly, are children of late Syed 
Sajjad Husain Shah. They have approached this Court through their 
guardian/next friend whereas respondent No.1, namely, Mst. Sarwat 
Fatima (“the respondent”) is widow of late Syed Sajjad Hussain 
Shah. The petitioners, have mounted challenge to the concurrent 
findings of the Courts below, whereby the respondent was held 
entitled to recovery of Rs.300,000/-, as dower, in suit instituted by her 
for recovery of the said amount.  
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that the respondent instituted the 
above referred suit for recovery on the strength of entry recorded in 
column No.15 of her Nikahnama with late Syed Sajjad Hussain Shah. 
The suit was contested by the petitioners, on the ground that the said 
entry in the Nikhanama was interpolated by the respondent. After the 
framing of issues and recording of the evidence, the suit was decreed 
by the learned Judge Family Court, Rawalpindi, vide judgment and 
decree dated 07.12.2019, and when appeal was preferred by the 
petitioners, the same was dismissed by the Appellate Court below, 
vide judgment dated 31.08.2020. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners, inter alia, contends that the 
impugned judgments suffer from material misreading and non-reading

of evidence inasmuch as the Courts below have failed to take into 
consideration that the Nikahnama of the respondent with predecessor-
in-interest of the petitioners was not registered in accordance with 
law, and remained in possession of the respondent and got registered 
on 15.06.2014, after death of late Syed Sajjad Hussain Shah, who died 
on 18.02.2014, by interpolating the entry regarding the dower amount. 
Adds that instead of appreciating the evidentiary resume of the case, 
the learned Trial Court has relied upon weaknesses of case of the 
petitioners/defendants, which offends settled principle of law that a 
plaintiff has to stand on its own legs. 
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent has placed 
reliance upon case reported as “Haseen Ullah v Mst. Naheed Begum 
and others (PLD 2022 Supreme Court 686), to contend that a 
registered Nikahnama carries presumption as to its truthness and the 
entries recorded therein are to be conjunctively read for the benefit of 
the wife and any dower agreed is a lien on the property left by the 
deceased husband. 
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
6. 
Generally, factual determination in a case instituted under the 
Family Courts Act, 1964 is immune from interference by this Court in 
exercise of its constitutional jurisdiction, however, the present case 
falls under an exception where the evidence on record has been 
misread and the applicable law has been misapplied, for the reasons 
set forth in the succeeding paragraphs of this judgment.     
7. 
It is admitted by the respondent that her Nikah/marriage with 
father of the petitioners was solemnized on 24.10.2013, whereafter the 
husband died on 18.02.2014. In ordinary circumstances if the 
respondent had produced her Nikahnama duly registered in 
accordance with law, the same could have carried presumption of 
truth attached to it and it was for the petitioners to prove that the

document was interpolated because in order to carry presumption of 
truth by a public document, it is imperative that such document is 
registered and/or kept/maintained, in accordance with law, by the 
authority envisaged thereunder. However, in the present case, 
admittedly, the respondent produced her copy (پرت) of the Nikahnama, 
which reflects that it was registered on 15.06.2014 i.e., approximately 
four months after the death of predecessor-in-interest of the 
petitioners/husband of the respondent. The Courts below have not 
holistically examined the evidentiary resume of the case and gravely 
erred by not appreciating this crucial aspect of the case. The 
respondent, appeared as PW-1, and categorically stated as under:

The respondent claims that it was her deceased husband/predecessor-
in-interest of the petitioners, who gave the copy of the Nikahnama to 
her, which has not been tampered, leading to an inference that it was 
registered when handed over to the respondent, however, star witness, 
who is statedly, Nikah Khawan, appeared as PW-2 and stated that the 
Nikah was registered in accordance with law on 15.06.2014, i.e., after 
death of the husband of the respondent/predecessor-in-interest of the 
petitioners. This creates a paradoxical position. Presumption of truth 
attached to the Nikahnama, being a public document, is rebuttable and 
the above-mentioned factual matrix of the case as also the evidentiary

resume, clearly indicates that the respondent failed to prove that the 
Nikahnama of the respondent with predecessor-in-interest of the 
petitioners was a genuine document. This Court in case reported as 
“Ejaz Iqbal v Additional District Judge, etc.”  (available at website 
of this court at 2021 LHC 9385) while examining the procedure for 
solemnization of Nikah and its registration, held that since second and 
third copy (پرت) of the Nikahnama are with the parties, hence, 
possibility that the same may be tampered by addition or deletion of 
an entry cannot be ruled out, and it is fourth copy (پرت) duly 
forwarded to the Union Council concerned or the (first pert) one that 
is kept in the original register is the document that carries the 
presumption of truth. In the instant case, the first and fourth copy 
(پرت) were never produced and admittedly the copy of Nikahnama 
with the respondent, containing the date of registration after the death 
of husband of the respondent was brought on record. These facts 
imply that the Nikahnama brought on record by the respondent was 
never registered in accordance with law and hence, the presumption of 
truth was not attached to the same, therefore, the petitioners were not 
obligated to dislodge the presumption of truth attached to the 
Nikahnama as held by the Courts below.  
8. 
Insofar as the averment of learned counsel for the respondent 
that the grand-mother of the petitioners/mother-in-law of the 
respondent appeared before the Trial Court as she was arrayed as 
defendant No.1 (died during the pendency of the suit and was 
represented through the petitioners) and acknowledged that the Nikah 
of the respondent with her son/deceased predecessor-in-interest of the 
petitioners was solemnized and Rs.300,000/- was fixed as dower, 
which is unpaid is concerned, the said statement is neither reliable nor 
can be made  basis for decreeing the suit of the respondent for 
recovery of dower as admittedly, the grand-mother of the 
petitioners/mother-in-law of the respondent neither attended the Nikah

ceremony nor she was witness of the Nikah, which fact is admitted by 
the respondent in the following terms:

The above quoted portion of the statement of the respondent destroys 
the case of the respondent that has been completely ignored by the 
Courts below. Copy of statement (Mark-B recorded before the learned 
Trial Court) of Mst. Nazeer Fatima, grand-mother of the 
petitioners/mother-in-law of the respondent cannot be relied upon as 
she admittedly was not present when the Nikah was solemnized, on 
account of her ill-health, and admittedly, did not attend the Court, as 
per the stance of the respondent reproduced hereinabove, when the 
statement was recorded.  
9.  
Adverting to the reliance placed on the ratio laid down in case 
of Haseen Ullah supra, suffice to observe that the same is settled law 
qua obligation of a husband to pay the dower and is applicable in 
cases where the registered Nikahnama carrying presumption of truth 
is brought on record, however, is not helpful to the respondent, on 
account of distinguishable facts.  
10. 
Both the Courts below have erred in appreciating the 
evidentiary resume of the case and the same merits interference by 
this Court in exercise of its constitutional jurisdiction. The impugned 
judgments and decrees of the Courts below are not sustainable and

hence, set aside. The present petition is allowed. Resultantly, the suit 
of the respondent is dismissed
