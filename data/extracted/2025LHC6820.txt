JUDGMENT 
Date of hearing:  
       20.11.2025 
Petitioner by: 
Khawaja Muhammad Asghar 
Farooq, Advocates. 
Respondent No.1 by: 
Ch. Amjad Hassan Ali, 
Advocate. 
 
MIRZA VIQAS RAUF, J. This petition under Article 199 
of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
(hereinafter referred to as “Constitution”) arises out of an 
ejectment application filed by respondent No.1 (hereinafter referred 
to as “respondent”) seeking eviction of the petitioner from shop 
No.21 situated in new Sabzi Mandi Talagang Road within the limits 
of Municipal Committee City Chakwal (hereinafter referred to as 
“shop in question”). The eviction was sought on the grounds of 
default in payment of rent and subletting. While resisting the 
ejectment proceedings the petitioner filed an application seeking 
leave to contest. Leave to contest was granted to the petitioner vide 
order dated 16th June, 2022 by learned Special Judge (Rent), 
Chakwal and from the divergent pleadings of the parties multiple 
issues were framed. After framing of issues evidence of both the 

W.P. No.4274 of 2023 
-2- 
 
sides was recorded and finally ejectment application was dismissed 
vide order dated 5th June, 2023. Feeling dissatisfied, the 
respondent preferred an appeal before learned Additional District 
Judge, Chakwal, which was allowed through judgment dated 15th 
November, 2023, which is now impugned in the instant petition. 
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that there exists 
no relationship of landlord and tenant interse the petitioner and 
respondent. He added that though overwhelming material was 
available to this effect but same was discarded without assigning 
any lawful reasoning. Learned counsel contended that even 
otherwise the respondent has badly failed to lead any cogent 
evidence to establish that the petitioner is occupying the shop in 
question as his tenant. Learned counsel further contended that in 
case of denial of relationship learned Special Judge (Rent) was 
right in his approach to dismiss the ejectment application. It is 
argued with vehemence that learned Additional District Judge 
without applying his independent judicious mind to the facts of the 
case allowed the appeal through the impugned judgment, which is 
not tenable at all. 
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent while 
defending the impugned judgment passed by learned Additional 
District Judge vehemently opposed this petition. 
4. 
Heard. Record perused. 
5. 
In order to get the shop in question vacated the respondent 
moved an ejectment application under Section 19 of the Punjab 
Rented Premises Act, 2009 (hereinafter referred to as “Act, 2009”) 
on the grounds mentioned hereinabove. While resisting the 
ejectment application an application for leave to contest was filed 
by the petitioner in terms of Section 22 of the Act, 2009 wherein he 
denied the relationship of landlord and tenant. The moot point thus 
involved in this petition is as to “whether there exists any 
relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties?” 

W.P. No.4274 of 2023 
-3- 
 
6. 
Before adverting to the core issue, it would be apposite to 
mention here that a respondent is precluded to resist the ejectment 
proceedings unless he obtains leave from the Special Judge (Rent). 
In the light thereof the petitioner moved an application under 
Section 22 of the Act, 2009 seeking leave to contest. It evinces 
from the record that the petitioner in his application for leave to 
contest denied the existence of relationship of landlord and tenant 
in the following manner :-

On the basis of above stance of the petitioner leave was granted to 
him vide order dated 16th June, 2022. 
7. 
In order to prove his case, the respondent produced his 
special attorney as AW1 whereas Tariq Mehmood and Sohail Abid 
were also examined as AW2 & AW3, respectively. The 
respondent also produced multiple documents in addition to the 
oral account.  From the analysis of the evidence it is evident that 
the respondent has successfully discharged the initial onus. On the 
contrary, the petitioner himself put his appearance in the witness 
box as RW1 and submitted his affidavit as Exhibit-R1 whereas he 
examined Faizan Ashraf and Muhammad Latif as RW2 & RW3. 
Both the said witnesses produced their affidavits as Exhibit-R2 & 
Exhibit-R3, respectively. The petitioner also tendered certain 
documents in the shape of Exhibit-R4 to Exhibit-R11 & Mark-R1, 
respectively. 
8. 
It is admitted position on the record that original owner of 
the shop in question was Khizar Hayat from whom the 
respondent purchased it through registered sale deed (Exhibit-

W.P. No.4274 of 2023 
-5- 
 
A10). It is the stance of the petitioner that he alongwith Zahoor 
Ahmad purchased the shop in question through agreement to sell 
but while appearing in the witness box he deposed as under :-

From the extract of the statement of petitioner, it is clearly evident 
that though in his application for leave to contest, he took the stance 
that the shop in question is in the occupation of Zahoor Ahmad 
being tenant but in his statement, he clearly conceded that in fact he 
is occupying the shop and initially it was obtained on rent from the 
original owner. In view of this stance of the petitioner, it is 
established that he entered into the shop in question being tenant 
under the original owner namely Khizar Hayat. In this backdrop 
when the respondent purchased the shop in question from the 
original owner, he stepped into his shoes and thus, for all intents 
and purposes, became the landlord. Needless to observe that once a 
tenant is always a tenant. 
9. 
So far contention of learned counsel for the petitioner that no 
notice under Section 30 of the Act, 2009 was given to the 
petitioner regarding transfer of ownership; suffice to observe that 
mere fact that no separate notice was served upon the petitioner qua 
the change of ownership would not be sufficient to equip him with 
a valid defence to resist the ejectment application. Filing of an 
ejectment application itself is a notice to the tenant. Guidance in 
this regard can be sought from PIR MUHAMMAD MANJH versus 

W.P. No.4274 of 2023 
-6- 
 
NAVEED IQBAL MALIK and 2 others (2017 MLD 418) wherein it is held 
that :- 
“7. 
Adverting to the point No.(i), it is observed that the 
respondents No.1 & 2 in their ejectment petition specifically 
asserted that they had sent a notice to the petitioner regarding 
change of ownership which remained unattended, however, in 
his application for leave to contest, which was granted and the 
same was treated as written reply in terms of Section 23 of 
“The Act, 2009”, the petitioner denied any such notice. To this 
effect issue No.2 was framed by the learned Special Judge 
(Rent) and onus of proof was placed upon the respondents. 
Admittedly the tenancy between the parties was not registered 
in conformity with the provisions of “The Act, 2009” and the 
respondents No.1 & 2 have deposited fine in the Government 
treasury in terms of Section 9 of “The Act, 2009”, so that their 
ejectment application should become entertainable. As per 
stance of respondents No.1 & 2, the suit premises was 
purchased by them through registered sale deed bearing 
No.378 dated 01st of October, 2012 (Exhibit-A7) from 
Muhammad Moazzam and the petitioner was occupying the 
premises as tenant under the previous owner. As the tenancy 
had expired so they informed the petitioner to vacate the suit 
premises as they do not want to continue the tenancy. They 
also sent a legal notice (Exhibit-A2) confirming their intention 
but the same was not responded, rather the petitioner instituted 
a civil suit against the previous owner without impleading 
respondents No.1 & 2 as party. The respondents No.1 & 2, 
however, moved an application under Order I Rule 10 of The 
Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908) which was allowed and 
consequently they were made party in the said suit. It is evident 
from the record that notice (Exhibit-A2) was duly served upon 
the petitioner through registered acknowledgment due dated 
08th of March, 2013 which was tendered in evidence as 
Exhibit-A3. This aspect was even affirmed by the petitioner 
himself by way of a suggestion to respondent No.1, when he 
appeared as AW1 in the following manner :- 
This leaves no doubt that due compliance was made to Section 
30 of “The Act, 2009”. Even otherwise non-compliance of 
Section 30 does not entail any penal consequences, having 
adverse effect upon the competency of ejectment petition. This 
Court in the case of “Nadeem Zafar and others v. Muhammad 
Ismaeel and others” (PLD 2012 Lahore 178), while dilating 
upon the implication of Section 30 of “The Act, 2009” 
observed as under:- 
“6. The examination of this provision of law reveals that it 
is consisted upon the two parts. In the first place, it requires 
that a written intimation shall be sent to the tenant 
informing him about the new ownership and secondly he 
shall also apply to the Rent Registrar for entering his name 
in the register as the landlord of the premises. Under sub 
section (2) of the Section, Rent Registrar, after receiving 
the application of the new landlord, shall inform the tenant 
through a notice about the transfer .of the ownership of the 
premises and the tenant shall not be, deemed to have 
defaulted in the payment of the rent if the rent due is paid 
or tendered to the new landlord within a period of 30 days 

W.P. No.4274 of 2023 
-7- 
 
from the date when the notice should in normal course have 
reached the tenant. It is nowhere provided in either part of 
section if no notice either to tenant or to Rent Registrar is 
sent whether ejectment petition would be liable to be 
dismissed. Although in section the word "shall" has been 
used, but it appears that the intention of the legislature 
while enacting this provision of law could be that the cases 
of the parties should not be thrown out of the court on the 
basis that notice of change of ownership has not been sent. 
This intention of the legislature is also evident from the 
preamble of the Act ibid which reads as under:-- 
"Whereas it is expedient to regulate the relationship of 
landlord and tenant, to provide a mechanism for settlement 
of their disputes in an expeditious and cost effective 
manner and for connected matters." (emphasis provided). 
Thus it follows that purpose of enactment is to provide 
expeditious remedy in rent matters but it does not allow 
expeditious disposal at cost of technicalities. 
7. In view of this legal position of the law as well as rules 
of interpretation the word "shall" used in section shall be 
read as "May". This interpretation of the Section finds 
further support from the other facts that the 'question of 
default in the payment of rent is to be determined by the 
court after recording the evidence of the parties or in , cases 
where the default is evident from the record or in case 
where relationship of landlord and tenant is denied by the 
parties. This determination has to be undertaken even if no 
notice as required is sent. The purposes of the enactment of 
this section is to regulate and register the new landlord so 
that the dispute of denial of tenancy could be avoided 
which was a consistent practice when the repealed law was 
in the field. In those cases the ejectment petition remained 
pending in the court for years for determination of title of 
the landlord. Keeping in view this expediency and 
mechanism provided for expeditious disposal of the rent 
matter, it is held that ejectment petitioner may not be non 
suited on the ground that he did not send intimation 
regarding new ownership either to the tenant or to the Rent 
Registrar, particularly, when tenant had notice of the same 
when ejectment petition is instituted against him.” 
Reference to the above effect can also be made to Hafiz MUHAMMAD 
SHAHID NAWAZ versus Hafiz MUHAMMAD SAEED (2010 CLC 1941). The 
relevant extract from the same is reproduced below :- 
“7………The appellant's contention that respondent has 
never served any notice with regard to the change of 
ownership, is not maintainable, as filing of the ejectment 
petition is a sufficient notice of change of ownership in 
favour of the respondent, whereafter the appellant is not 
entitled to raise such an objection. This view has been 
supported by Syed Azhar Imam Rizvi v. Mst. Salma 
Khatoon (1985 SCMR 24), the relevant extract of which is 
as under: 
"…..It is also not correct that after admission by the 
petitioner that he had received a copy of the ejectment 
application in 1978 wherein the factum of sale in favour 
of the respondent had clearly been mentioned, he was 

W.P. No.4274 of 2023 
-8- 
 
entitled to any other formal notice under section 13-A. 
The receipt of the copy of the ejectment application and 
knowledge gained thereby would constitute due notice 
and it will have to be treated as substantial compliance of 
section 13-A of the Ordinance...." 
The same view was further reiterated by this Court in the case of Lt. 
Gen. (Retd.) MUHAMMAD AFZAL NAJEEB versus Mst. AYSHA KHANNA 
through General Attorney (PLD 2010 Lahore 56). 
10. 
The petitioner is seeking writ of certiorari in terms of Article 
199(1)(a)(ii) of the Constitution, which has a very limited scope. 
The petitioner, in order to persuade the Court to exercise the 
extraordinary jurisdiction, have to demonstrate that the order or 
judgment under assailance is either without lawful authority or 
suffers with material illegalities. The petitioner has failed to point 
out any perversity or material irregularity in the impugned judgment, 
warranting exercise of constitutional jurisdiction by this Court.  
11. 
The nutshell of above discussion is that this petition is devoid 
of any merits, as such it fails and is accordingly dismissed with no 
order as to costs.
