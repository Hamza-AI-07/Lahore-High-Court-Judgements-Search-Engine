Appellant  
represented by:

Respondent by: Mr. Muhammad Jafar, Law Officer for the 
Respondent and Election Commission of Pakistan. 
 
 
                                 SADIQ MAHMUD KHURRAM, J.-         This election 
appeal has been filed by the Appellant under Section 63 of the Elections Act, 
2017 read with Rule 54 of the Election Rules, 2017 for setting aside the order 
dated 18.03.2023 passed by the Respondent Returning Officer, Constituency 
PP-261, Rahim Yar Khan -VII who rejected the nomination papers of the 
appellant. 
2.        Brief facts of the case are that the Election Commission of Pakistan 
called upon the voters of the Constituency PP-261, Rahim Yar Khan -VII, to 
elect a Member from the said Constituency  and the schedule of the election 
was announced. The appellant  namely Saifullah along with others filed 
nomination papers before the returning officer (the respondent ). The

nomination papers of the appellant namely  Saifullah  were rejected by the 
Respondent  Returning Officer, Constituency PP-261, Rahim Yar Khan -VII  
vide order dated 18.03.2023. 
3.    The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the order dated 
18.03.2023 passed by the Returning Officer, PP-261 Rahim Yar Khan-VII, 
whereby he proceeded to reject the nomination papers of the appellant on the 
ground that the Computerized National Identity Card (C.N.I.C) of the 
proposer was expired, was liable to be set-aside being against the facts and 
the law; that the expiry of Computerized National Identity Card (C.N.I.C) 
does not act as obliterating the very identity of the proposer as a voter; that 
even according to section 26 of the Elections Act, 2017, an expired 
Computerized National Identity Card (C.N.I.C) of a person is deemed to be 
valid for the purpose of his registration as a voter. 
4.               Mr. Muhammad Jaffar, Law Officer, Election Commission of 
Pakistan has submitted the original record and stated that the Respondent had 
rightly rejected the nomination papers of the appellant . 
5.         Arguments of all the parties have been heard and the available record 
has been perused. 
6.       A perusal of the record reveals that the nomination papers of the 
appellant were rejected by the Returning Officer, Constituency PP-261, 
Rahim Yar Khan -VII on the ground that the Computerized National Identity 
Card (C.N.I.C) of Ghulam Fareed , the proposer of the appellant , was expired 
and that the signatures on the  Computerized National Identity Card (C.N.I.C) 
of Ghulam Fareed were different from the signatures of Ghulam Fareed 
available on FORM A .It is trite that the expiry of the Computerized National 
Identity Card (C.N.I.C) does not act as obliterating the very identity of the

proposer as a voter. According to section 26 of the Elections Act, 2017, an 
expired Computerized National Identity Card (C.N.I.C) of a person is deemed 
to be valid for the purpose of his registration as a voter. The section 26 of the 
Elections Act, 2017 provides as under :- 
26. Preparation of preliminary electoral rolls.—(1) Subject to the 
superintendence, directions and control of the Commission, the Registration 
Officer shall prepare the electoral rolls by including in the electoral rolls, 
the name of every person entitled to be enrolled as a voter in an electoral 
area under this Act.   
 (2) A person shall be entitled to be enrolled as a voter in an electoral area 
if he—   
 (a) is a citizen of Pakistan;   
 (b) is not less than eighteen years of age;   
 (c) possesses a National Identity Card issued by the National Database and 
Registration Authority at any time till the last day fixed for inviting claims, 
objections and applications for preparation, revision or correction of 
electoral rolls;   
 (d) is not declared by a competent court to be of unsound mind; and   
 (e) is or is deemed under section 27 to be resident in the electoral area.   
 Explanation.—The National Identity Card issued by the National Database 
and Registration Authority shall be deemed to be valid for the purpose of 
registration as a voter or for casting vote in an election, 
notwithstanding the expiry of its validity period. (emphasis supplied) 
  
Proposer and/or seconder are not defined anywhere in the Elections Act, 2017 
or the Election Rules, 2017. The provisions of the Punjab Local Governments 
(Conduct of Elections) Rules, 2013 are in pari materia to the relevant 
provisions under the Elections Act, 2017.  The august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan , in the case of  Nadeem Shafi Versus Tariq Shuja Butt And Other (P 
L D 2016 Supreme Court 944) , while dilating upon the provisions of  Punjab 
Local Governments (Conduct of Elections) Rules, 2013, held as under:- 
 “Proposer and/or seconder are not defined anywhere in the Act ibid or the 
2013 Rules, therefore, it would appear that the only qualification of a 
proposer and/or seconder are that he/she be a voter of the constituency.” 

Election Appeal No.03 of 2023

The requirement of being qualified to subscribe to the nomination paper as a 
proposer, therefore, is that the proposer must be a voter of that constituency 
for which the candidate aspires to be elected as a member. When an expired 
Computerized National Identity Card (C.N.I.C) of a person is deemed to be 
valid for the purpose of his registration as a voter, then a proposer whose 
Computerized National Identity Card (C.N.I.C) is expired at the time of 
subscribing to the nomination paper or at the time of scrutiny of the 
nomination paper of a candidate, the proposer or the seconder cannot be 
termed as not qualified to subscribe to the nomination paper for that reason. 
With regard to the observation of the Returning Officer, Constituency PP-261, 
Rahim Yar Khan -VII  that the signatures on the  Computerized National 
Identity Card (C.N.I.C) of Ghulam Fareed were different from the signatures 
of Ghulam Fareed available on FORM A, it is observed that such 
determination could not have been made by the Returning Officer, 
Constituency PP-261, Rahim Yar Khan -VII without having referred the 
matter to an expert. Reliance in this regard is placed on the case of  Mst. 
Sumaira Malik versus Malik Umar Aslam Awan And Others (2018 S C M R 
1432), wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held as under:- 
“Insofar as Article 84 is concerned, we are of the view that keeping in mind 
the requisite standard of proof it is unsafe for the Court (which would here 
include an election tribunal) to itself carry out a visual examination and 
comparison of the record. In election matters, if at all such an exercise has 
to be carried out, it must be referred to expert opinion (which would here 
include the opinion of any relevant regulatory body or authority such as 
NADRA). The totality of the evidence must be considered only while taking 
such report into account and applying the requisite standard.” 

Election Appeal No.03 of 2023

At this stage, the Tribunal is of the view that if the appellant  is allowed to 
contest the election and even if he succeeds, there would still be a remedy to 
challenge the election by way of an Election petition whereas on the other 
hand, if this appeal is rejected, the appellant would be ousted from the election 
arena which would be irreparable damage. The wisdom of summary inquiry 
contemplated under the provisions of Election Rules, 2017  has this rationale 
behind it. 
 
7. 
In view of the settled provisions of law as mentioned above,  this appeal 
is accepted and the Returning Officer, Constituency PP-261, Rahim Yar 
Khan -VII is directed to accept the appellant's nomination papers, if he is not 
otherwise disqualified on different/other grounds. Notwithstanding anything 
stated above, it is clarified that the findings recorded and observations made 
herein are based only on a tentative assessment of the material before the 
Tribunal, in the facts and circumstances brought to the notice of the Tribunal, 
for the limited purpose of deciding this appeal.
