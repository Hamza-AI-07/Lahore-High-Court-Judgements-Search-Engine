ALI ZIA BAJWA, J.:- Through the instant constitutional 
petition filed under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973, (hereinafter ‘the Constitution’) the petitioner sought recovery 
of the detenu namely Muhammad Azam, his real brother, who was allegedly 
in illegal detention of respondents No. 2 and 3, i.e. Station House Officers, 
Police Station Defense-A, Lahore and Police Station Bhawana, District 
Chiniot.  
2. 
Through the orders dated 07.02.2024 and 09.02.2024, directions 
were issued to respondent No.2/SHO, Police Station Defence-A, Lahore, and 
respondent No.3/SHO Police Station Bhawana, District Chiniot to produce the 
detenu before the Court. On 14.02.2024, SHO Police Station Bhawana, 
District Chiniot appeared before the Court and filed his report according to 
which the detenu was arrested on 13.02.2024 and sent to judicial lockup for 
Test Identification Parade (TIP) in connection with case FIR No.504/2023, 

Writ Petition No.8709/2024 
 
(2) 
dated 20.10.2023, offence under Section 392 PPC registered with Police 
Station Muhammad Wala, District Chiniot. Such conduct of the SHO Police 
Station Bhawana/respondent No. 3 was sufficient to raise eyebrows, as the 
entire process of arrest and sending the detenu to the judicial lockup for TIP 
was carried out after the direction was issued by this Court to produce him 
before it. In reply to the different Court queries, the conduct shown by 
respondent No.3 was evasive, thus, he was issued a show-cause notice to 
explain why the contempt proceedings should not be initiated against him. 
District Police Officer (DPO), Chiniot was also directed to appear before the 
Court along with the complete record of the aforementioned criminal case. On 
the next date of hearing, the DPO appeared before the Court and filed his 
report. The record of the case reflected that Muhammad Aslam ASI arrested 
the detenu on 13.02.2024 at 6:00 p.m. and produced him before the Area 
Magistrate on the same day at 8:00 p.m. in a slipshod manner as the case 
before this Court was fixed on 14.02.2024. It was seemingly done to legalize 
the custody of the detenu to avoid the legal consequences of keeping someone 
in illegal custody and to defeat the directions issued by this Court for the 
production of the detenu. According to the report of DPO, the detenu was 
lodged in District Jail Jhang on 13.02.2024 but the report of the 
Superintendent of that jail reflected that the detenu was received in the prison 
on 14.02.2024 at 7:10 p.m., meaning thereby that on 14.02.2024 the detenu 
was in the police custody but he was not produced before the Court. When 
confronted with the aforementioned state of affairs, the DPO pledged before 
the Court to hold an independent inquiry to expose the illegalities committed 
by his subordinate police officials.   
3. 
Today, District Police Officer, Chiniot appeared before the Court 
and stated that during the fact-finding inquiry, it was proved that the detenu 
Muhammad Azam remained in illegal custody. He further apprised the Court 
that the detenu has been discharged from the aforementioned criminal case 
and strict action stands initiated against the delinquent police officials 
involved in keeping the detenu in illegal custody, which shall be concluded 
expeditiously. Given the above, the show cause notice issued to the Station 
House Officer, Police Station Bhawana is hereby withdrawn, leaving the

matter to be dealt with by the internal mechanism of accountability in the 
police department.  
4. 
 
The Court is deeply concerned and must carefully consider how 
the situation described above could have been prevented. Illegal detention 
represents a major breach of fundamental human rights and freedom. In 
Pakistan, instances of illegal detention by police and other law enforcement 
agencies are a concern that undermines the rule of law and the trust of 
citizens in legal and judicial systems. The Constitution and statutory laws 
provide several safeguards against illegal detention. Article 4 of the 
Constitution enshrines the principle of legal protection for individuals. It 
guarantees and emphasizes that no action detrimental to a person’s life, 
liberty, body, reputation, or property shall be taken except in accordance 
with the law. This provision is a safeguard against the arbitrary actions by 
the State or its organs, ensuring that any measure taken against an individual 
must be justified through established legal procedures and standards. Article 
9 of the Constitution focuses on the security of individuals, asserting that no 
person shall be deprived of life or liberty except in accordance with law. 
This Article is a cornerstone for the protection of personal freedoms and 
safety, establishing the legal principle that any deprivation of life or liberty 
must follow due process and be sanctioned by law. Article 10 of the 
Constitution provides specific safeguards concerning arrest and detention, 
detailing the rights of individuals who are arrested or detained. It outlines the 
procedural rights afforded to such individuals, including the right to be 
informed of the grounds of arrest, the right to legal representation, and the 
right to be produced before a court within a specified period. This Article is 
crucial for ensuring that the process of arrest and detention is carried out 
transparently and legally, protecting individuals from unlawful or arbitrary 
detention. In Ismaeel1 the Supreme Court of Pakistan observed that the 
rights guaranteed under Articles 4, 9, and 10 of the Constitution are 
sacrosanct and jealously guarded by our Courts. Article 14(2) of the 
Constitution serves as a critical legal safeguard against the maltreatment of 
individuals under police custody, stating unequivocally: “No person shall be

subjected to torture for the purpose of extracting evidence.” Article 14(2) of 
the Constitution is a testament to the State’s commitment to safeguarding 
human rights and dignity against the menace of torture. The insertion of 
Article 10-A within the constitutional framework heralds a pivotal extension 
of the right to a fair trial and due process, not merely confining its scope to 
the courtroom but expansively integrating it into the pretrial proceedings, 
including the investigation phase. This provision, illustrative of the 
jurisprudential evolution towards safeguarding individual liberties, mandates 
that the fundamental rights of an accused are zealously guarded from the 
moment of accusation through to the final adjudication.  
5. 
 
The statutory regime under Sections 61, 62, and 167 of the 
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (hereinafter ‘the Code’) highlights our 
legal framework’s commitment to procedural fairness and the protection of 
rights of accused person following an arrest. These provisions are 
foundational to the criminal justice system, ensuring that the process from 
arrest to potential charges is carried out within the bounds of the law, with a 
continuous emphasis on the rights of the accused and the oversight of 
judicial authorities. These provisions of the law are pivotal in outlining the 
procedural rights of the accused and the responsibilities of law enforcement 
agencies from the moment of arrest through the period of custody until the 
investigation is completed. Section 61 of the Code stipulates that no 
individual shall be detained in custody by the police beyond the period of 
twenty-four hours without being presented before a Magistrate. Section 62 
of the Code further complements Section 61 by mandating that the Officer 
Incharge of a Police Station should report the cases of all persons arrested 
without a warrant to the authorities as provided therein. Section 62 of the 
Code, though often overlooked, plays a crucial role in safeguarding 
individuals from illegal detention by police officials. For better assistance 
Section 62 of the Code has been reproduced hereinafter: -  
“62. Police to report apprehensions. Officers in charge of police station 
shall report, to the [Zila Nazim, District Superintendent of Police and 
District Public Safety Commission set up under the Police Act, 1861 (V of 
1861)] the cases of all persons arrested without warrant, within the limits of 
their respective station, whether such persons have been admitted to bail 
or otherwise. 

Writ Petition No.8709/2024 
 
(5) 
……………………………. 
……………………………..” 
 
Rule 26.8 of the Punjab Police Rules, 1934 (hereinafter ‘the Police Rules’), 
which further reinforces Section 62 of the Code, has been reproduced 
hereinafter: -  
 
“26.8. Report of arrest: - (1) Under Section 62, Code of Criminal 
Procedure an officer in charge of a police station is required to report to 
the District Magistrate, Sub-Divisional Magistrate, or such other Magistrate 
as the District Magistrate may direct, all arrests without warrant made by 
himself or in his jurisdiction. 
(2) Reports of such arrests shall be made in Form 26.8 (2) whether the 
person arrested has been admitted to bail or not and may be sent by post.” 
These provisions are designed to ensure transparency and accountability in 
the operation of law enforcement agencies, providing a legal framework that 
mandates that an ‘Arrest Report’ must be sent to the concerned authorities 
during the first twenty-four hours of the arrest of an accused and detention. 
By stipulating the rights of the detained individuals and the responsibilities 
of the detaining authorities, Section 62 of the Code serves as a critical 
mechanism for preventing abuse of power and illegal detentions.  
6. 
 
The common fallacy that police can retain custody of an 
accused for twenty-four hours without informing any authority is both 
incorrect and contrary to the law. This belief undermines the legal 
safeguards designed to protect the rights of individuals and ensure 
transparency and accountability within law enforcement processes. The legal 
framework mandates that police authorities must report arrests and 
detentions to higher authorities promptly under Section 62 of the Code. This 
requirement serves as a critical check against arbitrary detention, ensuring 
that each case is subject to oversight and that the rights of the arrestees are 
protected. The necessity to report arrest/detention helps to prevent abuse of 
power, ensuring that the detention of individuals is always justified, 
documented, and subject to legal scrutiny. It was ruled in Muhammad 
Siddiq2 that an arrest report under Section 62 of the Code sent to the quarters 
concerned, is not a matter of sending greetings to them, but such a report is

sent so that they can scrutinize the arrest made by Police Officer and find out 
if the action can be justified in law.  
7. 
 
Section 167 of the Code further addresses the situation where 
the investigation cannot be completed within twenty-four hours, granting the 
investigating officer the authority to seek an extension of the detention 
period. This provision of law lays down the procedure for such an extension 
to be granted by the Magistrate. The provision that mandates the transfer of 
custody of an accused to a Magistrate within twenty-four hours of arrest is a 
significant safeguard designed to minimize the risk of illegal detention by 
the police. This legal requirement ensures a critical layer of judicial control, 
preventing the prolonged, unauthorized holding of accused without formal 
charges or legal justification. By involving the judiciary at this early stage, it 
reinforces the principle that detention must always be subject to legal review 
and approval. 
8. 
 
The overall incharge of a criminal case is an Area Magistrate 
who, even during the progress of an investigation, gets many opportunities 
to go through the record of an investigation conducted by the police.3 The 
Area Magistrate acts as a pivotal character in our criminal justice system, 
therefore, his supervisory role ensures that police investigations adhere to 
the principles of justice, transparency, and fairness, which are fundamental 
to maintaining public trust in the criminal justice system. He plays a crucial 
role in safeguarding the rights of the accused and the complainant, ensuring 
that investigating agencies do not infringe upon fundamental rights and 
investigations are conducted in a manner that upholds lawfulness. This 
involves ensuring that investigations are conducted fairly, transparently, and 
within the legal framework.  
9. 
 
When faced with the decision of granting physical or judicial 
remand for TIP, a Magistrate must approach the matter with the utmost 
diligence, keeping his eyes and ears open, and not in a perfunctory manner. 
A Magistrate is tasked with carefully considering the facts, the law, and the 
circumstances of each case before making a decision that could significantly

impact an individual’s liberty and rights. The Magistrate should actively 
seek to understand the nuances of the case, including the evidence presented, 
the conditions under which the arrest was made, and the arguments from 
both the prosecution and the accused. It requires a thorough and thoughtful 
examination of all aspects of the case to ensure that any decision to grant 
remand is justified, lawful, and in accordance with settled principles 
governing the subject. A perfunctory approach, in contrast, implies a 
superficial or automatic decision-making process that neglects the careful 
consideration required in such matters. Such an approach might lead to 
unjust outcomes, including the unwarranted deprivation of liberty, the 
potential for abuse in custody, and the undermining of the public trust in the 
legal system. Therefore, a Magistrate’s role in remand proceedings is critical 
in safeguarding against arbitrary detention and ensuring that the rights of the 
accused are protected. By acting judiciously and an open-minded assessment 
of the evidence and legal arguments, Magistrates uphold the principles of 
justice and fairness that are foundational to any criminal justice system. 
10. 
 
 In the present case when the accused was produced before the 
Magistrate, for sending him to judicial lockup, he passed an order 
mechanically, without the careful and thoughtful consideration that is 
required for such a significant order which curtails the liberty of an 
individual. The order of the Magistrate has been reproduced as infra:

The Magistrate’s order, which authorized the incarceration of 
the detenu for TIP, lacks a detailed justification or rationale based on the 
evidence available on the police file, therefore, it is a non-speaking order. A 
speaking order in judicial proceedings is essential and refers to a judgment 
or decision delivered by a court that comprehensively outlines the reasons 
behind the court’s conclusions. Speaking orders provide a clear and detailed 
explanation of the reasoning behind a decision. An order being a ‘speaking 
one’ is also essential for the parties involved in the case to understand the 
basis of the findings of the court. This is also crucial if a party wishes to 
challenge the decision, as it provides a clear framework for the grounds of 
appeal. Without a reasoned judgment, it would be difficult to identify any 
potential errors in law or fact to challenge the same. Moreover, while 
dealing with the question of sending an accused to prison for TIP, a 
Magistrate has a crucial responsibility to thoroughly review the case diaries 
to determine the necessity of acceding to the request of the investigating 
agency. This process is not a mere formality, but a substantive judicial duty 
aimed at safeguarding the rights of the accused while balancing the 
requirements of the investigation. The order of the Magistrate, in the present 
case, has no reference to the case diaries and material available on the record 
warranting sending of the detenu to judicial lock-up for TIP. Had the 
Magistrate adequately assessed the facts and circumstances of this case, he 
would have been in a better position to protect an innocent person from 
police oppression. 
12. 
 
It has also been noticed by this Court that the detenu was 
produced before the Magistrate after court hours. The practice of presenting 
the accused before a Magistrate outside of regular court hours has been 
deprecated by the Courts. The principle here is that the accused should be 
produced before the Magistrate within official court hours to ensure the 
proceedings are conducted transparently and within the formal legal 
framework. Presenting an accused after court hours could necessitate 
conducting these proceedings at the Magistrate’s residence or another 
unofficial location, a practice that constitutional Courts have explicitly 
criticized for lacking transparency and formal procedural safeguards. The 
request of the investigating agency regarding remand should be entertained 

Writ Petition No.8709/2024 
 
(9) 
in open court during court hours unless there are extraordinary compelling 
reasons and circumstances for doing so in any other place than the open 
courtroom. Such reasons must be reflected in the order of the Magistrate. 
Reliance can be placed on Ghulam Sarwar and another vs. The State – 
1984 P.Cr.L.J. 2588. Moreover, the practice of presenting an accused before 
a Magistrate at a location other than the court premises, particularly after 
court hours, significantly impairs the accused’s access to legal 
representation. When an accused is produced at a Magistrate’s residence or 
any other unconventional location, it inherently restricts his ability to secure 
an advocate’s presence which is violative of Articles 10 and 10-A of the 
Constitution.   
13. 
 
Unfortunately, there exists a tendency amongst Magistrates to 
accede to requests for TIP without sufficient scrutiny of the underlying 
reasons presented by the police. Such a practice not only undermines the 
sanctity and the rigorous standards required for the deprivation of an 
individual’s liberty but also potentially compromises the integrity of the 
judicial process. The decision to send an accused to judicial lock-up for TIP 
should neither be taken lightly nor should it be the product of a perfunctory 
endorsement of the police’s request. It is incumbent upon the Magistrates to 
safeguard the rights of the accused while balancing the needs of the State to 
prosecute offenders. 
14. 
 
Before drawing the curtain on this judgment, it would be 
prudent to outline the fundamental rights of an individual arrested and 
investigated by the police.  
I. 
Upon apprehension and during subsequent detention, it is 
incumbent upon the detaining authority to promptly apprise 
the accused of the grounds for such arrest, in accordance 
with the principles of due process and legal transparency. 
Communicating the grounds for arrest and the details of 
accusations allows the accused to understand the allegations 
he is facing and offer an adequate defense. Such practice 
ensures that arrests are not made without sufficient cause or 

Writ Petition No.8709/2024 
 
(10) 
used as a tool of oppression, thereby safeguarding the liberty 
of citizens and the rule of law. 
II. 
An accused should be allowed to contact his family after his 
arrest. The ability to communicate with family ensures that 
the accused can alert others about his situation, potentially 
mobilizing support and advocacy on his behalf. This can be 
crucial for safeguarding their rights, especially in 
jurisdictions or situations where the risk of violation of the 
law is high. In essence, the right of an accused to contact his 
family immediately after arrest is a crucial safeguard against 
arbitrary and illegal arrest.  
III. 
An accused has an undeniable right to have legal advice 
instantly after his arrest. Police authorities have a crucial 
obligation to facilitate an accused to contact his lawyer 
following arrest. This duty is rooted in the principles of due 
process and the right to a fair trial, as recognized by Articles 
10 and 10-A of the Constitution. Providing an accused 
individual with access to legal representation is a 
cornerstone of a fair, just, and humane legal system. This 
access is not merely a procedural right but a foundational 
element that ensures the integrity of the criminal justice 
system.  
IV. 
The arrest report concerning an accused must be dispatched 
following Section 62 of the Code, together with Rule 26.8 of 
the Police Rules, to avoid instances of illegal detention. If 
the investigation extends beyond twenty-four hours, it is 
mandatory to bring the accused before a Magistrate to seek 
authorization for any further extension of custody under 
Section 167 of the Code.  
V. 
Upon the presentation of an arrested individual before the 
concerned Magistrate, it becomes the Magistrate’s solemn 
duty to safeguard the accused’s fundamental rights, a 

Writ Petition No.8709/2024 
 
(11) 
custodianship that forms the foundation of judicial integrity 
and fairness. In our criminal justice system, the role of the 
Magistrate is both significant and pivotal.  
VI. 
An accused must not be subjected to torture to elicit 
evidence or confession as prohibited under Article 14 of the 
Constitution, which advocates for fairness, equality, and 
dignity in the treatment of an accused. Ensuring compliance 
with this provision safeguards the accused from inhumane 
treatment and upholds the fundamental principles of justice 
and human dignity. 
VII. 
The safeguarding of the aforecited rights of an accused in 
custody must not only be ensured by the police officials but 
also be properly documented in the police record to reflect 
such efforts. 
15. 
 
This judgment serves as an earnest reminder to the Magistrates 
and police authorities of the grave responsibility they carry on their 
shoulders to safeguard the fundamental rights of those accused held in 
custody. Every accused person, irrespective of the charges against him, is 
entitled to fundamental rights which must be protected and respected 
throughout the criminal justice system.
