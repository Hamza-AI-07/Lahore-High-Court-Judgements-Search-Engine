                   7.10.2024 
For the Appellant: 
Ch. Umar Hayat, Advocate, assisted by

For the State: 
Mr. Shahid Aleem, District Public Prosecutor. 
 
 
 
Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – This appeal is directed against 
the judgment dated 12.11.2020 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, 
Dera Ghazi Khan, in case FIR No.1/2020 dated 23.2.2020 registered at 
Police Station BMP Bawata, District Dera Ghazi Khan, for an offence 
under section 9(c) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997  
(the “CNSA”). 
2. 
 
The brief facts of the case are that on 23.2.2020, 
Muhammad Iqbal/Naib Dafedar (the Complainant) (PW-1) was present 
at the Bawata Check Post, with other police officials. Around 2:00 p.m., 
he noticed Car No. 826-Sindh-ANW approaching from Balochistan. 
When signalled to stop, the vehicle accelerated, arousing suspicion. The 
police party managed to stop the car by placing a barrier in its path. 
Upon stopping, the driver exited from the vehicle and fled northwards. 
The Complainant and the other cops chased him, during which the 
suspect slipped and sprained his left foot. The Complainant apprehended 
the suspect, who identified himself as Awais Qarni (the Appellant). He 
brought the Appellant back to the Bawata Check Post. Car No.  
826-Sindh-ANW smelt of charas. The Complainant searched it and 
recovered twenty packets of charas hidden in the front doors and five 
packets in the rear right door. Each packet weighed 800 grams, totalling 
20 kilograms. The Complainant drafted the complaint Exh. PC and sent 
it to the Police Station BMP Bawata, District Dera Ghazi Khan, through 

Crl. Appeal No.531/2020

Amjad Ali/Sawar (PW-2). FIR No.1/2020 (Exh. PC/1) was registered in 
pursuance of the said complaint. A report under section 173 Cr.P.C. was 
submitted upon completion of the investigation. On 21.3.2020, the 
Additional Sessions Judge framed charge against the Appellant, to which 
he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. 
3. 
 
The prosecution produced four witnesses to prove the 
charge. Muhammad Iqbal/Naib Dafedar (PW-1) was the Complainant of 
the case and deposed about the recovery of charas and Car No.  
826-Sindh-ANW from the Appellant. Amjad Ali/Sawar (PW-2) was a 
marginal witness of Recovery Memos Exh. PA and Exh. PB. Karim 
Nawaz/Jamedar (PW-3) provided the details of his investigation. Haji 
Muhammad/Moharrar (PW-4) registered FIR No.1/2020 (Exh. PC/1). 
He also testified about receiving the case property from the Investigating 
Officer and handing it over to the Complainant for delivery at the office 
of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA). The prosecutor gave up 
PW Munir Ahmad/Sawar being unnecessary and closed the prosecution 
evidence after tendering the report of the PFSA Exh. PE - Exh. PE/1. 
4. 
 
Upon the completion of the prosecution evidence, the 
Additional Sessions Judge recorded the Appellant’s statement under 
section 342 Cr.P.C. The Appellant denied the allegations and professed 
innocence. When asked why he had been implicated in the case, he 
stated that he was a 24-year-old F.A. student and a Hafiz-e-Quran from a 
low-income family in Quetta. He decided to support his father 
financially by moving to Lahore, where he intended to work and 
contribute to the family’s expenses while pursuing further studies. The 
Appellant maintained that on 21.02.2020, at about 9:00 a.m., during the 
first leg of his journey to Lahore, he boarded a car driven by Fazal 
Hussain to travel to D.G. Khan as a passenger, paying a fare of three 
thousand rupees. The Appellant alleged that charas was recovered from 
Fazal Hussain, but the police released him after accepting a bribe and 
falsely implicated him in the case. When he protested against his 
wrongful involvement, Muhammad Iqbal and Amjad Ali subjected him 
to physical violence, resulting in an injury to his left leg. The Appellant 
claimed he had no knowledge of any secret cavities in the vehicle or the 

Crl. Appeal No.531/2020 
 
- 3 - 
concealment of charas and asserted that no contraband was recovered 
from his possession. 
5. 
 
The Appellant neither got his statement recorded on oath 
under section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor examined any witness in his defence. 
However, he tendered documentary evidence, which included a Hifz-e-
Quran certificate, matriculation certificate, birth certificate, provisional 
character certificate, and the result card of English Language Course 
(Exh. DB & Exh. DB/1, Exh. DC, Exh. DD, Exh. DE and Exh. DF). 
6. 
 
On the conclusion of the trial, vide judgment dated 
12.11.2020, the Additional Sessions Judge convicted the Appellant 
under section 9(c) of the CNSA and sentenced him to life imprisonment 
with a fine of Rs.100,000/- and, in default thereof, to suffer simple 
imprisonment for further one year. The benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. 
was extended to him. Hence, this appeal. 
7. 
 
The Appellant’s counsel contended that the prosecution 
could not prove the charge against the Appellant beyond reasonable 
doubt. The PWs were inconsistent and contradicted each other on 
material particulars. He further contended that safe custody of the case 
property and secure transmission of the sample parcels to the PFSA were 
not proved. Hence, the Government Analyst’s report Exh. PE - Exh. 
PE/1 could not be relied upon. The learned counsel argued that the 
conviction recorded against the Appellant was not sustainable and liable 
to be set aside. 
8. 
 
The District Public Prosecutor vehemently opposed this 
appeal. He contended that the prosecution had proved its case to the hilt. 
He argued that Muhammad Iqbal/Naib Dafedar (PW-1) and Amjad 
Ali/Sawar (PW-2) supported the prosecution case, in whose presence  
25 packets of charas were recovered from the Appellant. The positive 
report of the PFSA Exh. PE - Exh. PE/1 reinforced their testimony. He 
maintained that the prosecution evidence was trustworthy. There were 
no material contradictions that could benefit the Appellant. He prayed 
for the dismissal of this appeal.

10. 
 
The prosecution’s case is that on 23.2.2020, the Appellant 
was arrested at Bawata Check Post, District Dera Ghazi Khan, with 
twenty-five packets of charas, each weighing 800 grams (total: 20 kgs.). 
The prosecution produced Complainant Muhammad Iqbal/Naib Dafedar 
(PW-1) and Amjad Ali/Sawar (PW-2) to prove that recovery.  
11. 
 
Complainant Muhammad Iqbal/Naib Dafedar (PW-1) 
testified that on 23.2.2020, he recovered twenty-five packets of charas 
from the cavities of the doors of Car No. 826-Sindh-ANW. He weighed 
each packet, separated 40 grams from every packet, and prepared 
twenty-five sealed sample parcels for chemical analysis. He further 
stated that he sealed the remaining charas in twenty-five separate sealed 
parcels (P-2/1-25), affixed his stamp bearing the acronym “M.I.” on all 
the parcels in the presence of Amjad Ali/Sawar (PW-2), and Munir 
Ahmad/Sawar (not produced), and secured them vide Recovery Memo 
Exh. PA. He also took the car (P-1) into his possession through 
Recovery Memo Exh. PB. Then, he drafted the complaint Exh. PC and 
sent it to the police station through Amjad Ali/Sawar (PW-2) for the 
registration of FIR No. 1/2020 Exh. PC/1.  
12. 
 
Amjad Ali/Sawar BMP (PW-2) recorded his examination-
in-chief on the same lines as Muhammad Iqbal (PW-1). 
13. 
 
Karim 
Nawaz/Jamedar 
(PW-3) 
deposed 
that 
the 
investigation of the case was entrusted to him on the same day the 
contraband was recovered, i.e., 23.02.2020. He visited the recovery site, 
arrested the Appellant, interrogated him, and recorded the statements of 
the prosecution witnesses under section 161 Cr.P.C. Based on their 
indications, he also prepared the rough site plan (Exh. PD). 
14. 
 
During his cross-examination, the Investigating Officer, 
Karim Nawaz (PW-3), testified that when he arrived at the recovery site 
at 3:15 p.m., the charas was already sealed, and the FIR number had 
been written on the parcels. This is unusual, as the responsibility for 
conducting all proceedings after the registration of the FIR rests with the 
Investigating Officer. Recognizing the damaging implications of his 
statement for the prosecution, PW-3 immediately attempted to retract it. 

Crl. Appeal No.531/2020 
 
- 5 - 
However, a careful analysis of the prosecution’s evidence, as detailed in 
the following paragraphs, compels us to reject his retraction. 
15. 
 
During his cross-examination, PW-1 Muhammad Iqbal 
conceded that the handwriting of the complaint, recovery memos, site 
plan, the statements recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C., and the 
application for judicial remand, and the report under section 173 Cr.P.C. 
was the same. Furthermore, during his cross-examination, PW-2 Amjad 
Ali stated that the documents were prepared by Moharrar Muhammad 
Haji (PW-4). The relevant excerpt is reproduced below: 
“Two recovery memos were prepared by the Investigating Officer. 
One of which is the complaint Exh. PC, and the other was the 
recovery memo. We did not make signatures on the parcels. Iqbal 
affixed the seal/stamp upon the parcels. I do not remember that Karim 
Nawaz made his signatures upon the complaint Exh. PC. I do not 
remember whether Karim Nawaz made his signatures on the recovery 
memos or not. The writings (Likh Parh) of this case were made by 
Moharrar Muhammad Haji in his own handwriting. After completing 
all proceedings of this case, Muhammad Haji obtained the signatures 
from all the officials present there, including me, Karim Nawaz, 
Muhammad Iqbal, Amjad Ali and Munir Ahmad.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Emphasis added) 
16. 
 
Admittedly, 
Muhammad 
Haji 
(PW-4) 
was 
not 
accompanying the police party when the Appellant was apprehended. 
Therefore, it is obvious that he did not complete the documentation at 
the recovery site but elsewhere. We have also noted that PW-3 Karim 
Nawaz attempted to attribute some of the documentation tasks to 
himself, but his testimony is inconsistent with that of the other witnesses. 
17. 
 
The above circumstances undermine the credibility of the 
alleged recovery of the contraband, making the prosecution’s case 
extremely doubtful. 
18. 
 
In narcotics cases, the prosecution must corroborate the 
recovery witnesses’ evidence with a positive forensic report from the 
government analyst, prepared in accordance with legal standards. It is 
also essential to ensure and demonstrate the safe custody of the case 
property and the secure transmission of sample parcels to the laboratory 
for chemical analysis. Any break in the chain of custody of sample 
parcels renders the forensic report inconsequential and wrings the 

Crl. Appeal No.531/2020 
 
- 6 - 
prosecution’s case.1 According to the Appellant’s counsel, safe custody 
of the case property, including the sample parcels, was breached in the 
instant case. 
19. 
 
During cross-examination, PWs Muhammad Iqbal and 
Karim Nawaz acknowledged that Rohi TV and the 24 News channel 
reported the recovery effected in this case. The defence counsel took 
advantage of this admission and confronted them with a photograph, 
which the Additional Sessions Judge marked as Exh. DA. While seeing 
the said photograph Exh. DA, PW Muhammad Iqbal stated: 
“While seeing Exh. DA, which is a photograph, the witness stated that 
he is present in photograph. Volunteered that the photographs might 
have been prepared fictitiously. It is incorrect to suggest that the 
volunteer portion of my statement is based on mala fide and I am 
suppressing the truth from the Court. It is correct that in Exh. DA, I, 
Munir Ahmad, Karim Nawaz, and Amjad are present, and accused 
Awais Qarni is also present in said Exh. DA. The Exh. DA appears to 
be made inside the police station Bawata. Charas is also lying in open 
condition on a table in Exh. DA wrapping in a plastic shopper. The 
said shopper was white and green in colour and had a monogram 
upon the same. Charas in Exh. DA is present in the shopper packets. I 
do not remember that media briefing of this case was made just before 
the production of the accused before the Court of learned Area 
Magistrate.” 
On the other hand, PW Karim Nawaz stated:  
 “The information  about the instant case was broadcast on Rohi TV 
and Channel 24-News. The witness by seeing a photograph Exh. DA 
stated that the media briefing about the case was made within the 
premises of the police station. I am present in the Exh. DA and  
along with me, Iqbal and Amjad are also present. The charas is 
present in open condition on a table in Exh. DA. The charas is present 
in open condition on a table in Exh. DA. The monograms on the 
packets are visible in Exh. DA. The charas is present in sealed white 
and green shoppers in Exh. DA. The media briefing was conducted 
before the production of accused Awais Qarni before the court of 
learned Area Magistrate. The accused was produced before the court 
of the learned Area Magistrate on 24.2.2020.” 
20. 
 
The precise date and time of the news coverage or media 
briefing have not been recorded. However, PW-3 Karim Nawaz stated 
during his cross-examination that it was “conducted before the 
production of accused Awais Qarni before the court of the … Area 
Magistrate on 24.2.2020”  (the day following the alleged recovery).

Based on the testimonies of PWs Muhammad Iqbal and 
Karim Nawaz, the defence challenges the integrity of the safe custody of 
the case property, including the sample parcels, and the validity of 
forensic report Exh. PE - Exh. PE/1. However, before assessing the 
strength of this argument, it is essential to consider whether the trial 
court rightly marked the said photograph as Exh. DA, introduced during 
the cross-examination by the defence, and whether the statements made 
by PWs Muhammad Iqbal and Karim Nawaz regarding the photograph 
are admissible.  
22. 
 
The admissibility of photographs as evidence depends on 
two key factors: relevance and authenticity. Relevance refers to the 
logical connection between the evidence and the facts at issue in the 
case. For evidence to be deemed relevant, it should help to prove or 
disprove the matter in dispute or form a necessary link in the chain of 
reasoning. On the other hand, authentication is the process of convincing 
a court that a “thing” (which may be a document) matches the claims 
made about it.2 In other words, authenticity involves demonstrating that 
the evidence is genuine and represents what it purports to be. The party 
presenting the evidence must prove that it has not been altered or 
tampered with. Authentication can be established through various 
means, including circumstantial proof. In United States v. Taylor,  
530 F.2d 639 (5th Cir. 1976), it was held that a photograph may have 
probative value that is independent of amplification by other testimony. 
In United States v. Stearns, 550 F.2d 1167 (9th Cir. 1977), it was held 
that photographs may be admitted into evidence based on circumstantial 
evidence when direct testimony about their creation is unavailable, 
provided that the circumstantial evidence, including the photograph’s 
content and related context, sufficiently establishes its authenticity. In 
The Queen v Aidan Quinn, [2011] NICA 19, the Northern Ireland Court 
of Appeal held that authenticity can also be established by admission.  
23. 
 
Authentication and relevance are intertwined.3 A document 
that cannot be authenticated lacks relevance (unless adduced as bogus).4

In the United States, the admissibility of photographs as 
evidence is governed by the Federal Rules of Evidence. Under Rule 901, 
photographs must be authenticated by a witness who can testify that it is 
a fair and accurate representation of what it purports to depict. The 
photographer’s testimony is not required as long as someone with 
firsthand knowledge can verify its authenticity. Rule 403 allows courts 
to exclude photographs if their probative value is substantially 
outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice, confusion, or misleading the 
jury.5  
25. 
 
In the United Kingdom, the legal approach to photographic 
evidence has evolved from common law principles. Historically, at 
common law, it was believed that only the person who took the 
photograph could authenticate it. Some authorities required the 
production of the negatives as part of this verification process. However, 
in R v. The United Kingdom Electronic Telegraph Company (Limited), 
(1862) 3 F&F 73; 176 ER 33, a photograph was admitted to show the 
nature of the surface of a highway in respect of an allegation of an 
obstruction. In R v. Tolson, (1864) 4 F&F 103, a case of bigamy, a 
photograph was produced, which was admitted to be a photograph of the 
first husband, and a witness was allowed to testify that he had seen the 
man in the photograph alive after the date of the allegedly bigamous 
marriage.6 In Hindson v. Ashby, [1896] 2 Ch 1, 21 AC), Smith LJ 
remarked (at p.21): “If photographs were anything more than pictures 
representing a particular place at a particular time, I should have thought 
that these last photographs should not have been looked at; but as 
photographs, unless verified upon oath, are not of themselves evidence, 
we looked at them as mere pictures.” On p.27, he said: “I cannot tell by 
looking at the photographs whether this be so or not; and even if I could, 
as I have before said, photographs per se and unverified are no evidence 
at all.” In The United States Shipping Board v. The Ship St. Albans, 
[1931] AC 632, it was held that a photographic picture cannot be relied 
                                          
5 Also see: Old Chief v. United States, 519 U.S. 172 (1997). 
6 Willes J commented in his summing up to the members of the jury: “The photograph was admissible 
because it is only a visible representation of the image or impression made upon the minds of the 
witnesses by the sight of the person or the object it represents; and, therefore, is, in reality, only 
another species of the evidence which persons give of identity when they speak merely from 
memory.” The jury subsequently entered a verdict of not guilty.

upon as proof in itself of the dimensions of the depicted objects and 
cannot be made properly available to establish the relative proportions of 
such objects except by evidence of personal knowledge or scientific 
experience to demonstrate accurately the facts sought to be established. 
This case illustrated the limitations of photographs as standalone 
evidence. In The Statute of Liberty Owners of Motorship Sapporo 
Maru v. Owners of Steam Tanker Statute of Liberty, [1968] 2 All ER 
195, [1968] 1 WLR 739, a civil action concerning a collision between 
two ships, Sir Jocelyn Simon P., rejecting a submission that a 
cinematograph film of radar echos recorded by a shore radar station, was 
inadmissible 
because 
produced 
mechanically 
without 
human 
intervention, said: “If tape-recordings are admissible, it seems that a 
photograph of radar reception is equally admissible – or indeed, any type 
of photograph. It would be an absurd distinction that a photograph 
should be admissible if the camera were operated manually by a 
photographer, but not if operated by a trip or clock mechanism.”  
In R v Dodson; R v Williams, [79 Cr App R 220, [1984] 1 WLR 971, the 
Court of Appeal entertained no doubt that photographs taken by security 
cameras installed at a building society office at which an armed robbery 
was attempted, were admissible in evidence, being relevant to the issue 
of both whether an offence was committed and, if so, who committed it. 
As to the latter issue, the jury was entitled to compare the photographic 
images with the accused sitting in the dock, and that the jury can do this 
will not prevent the calling of a witness who was not present at the scene 
of the crime, but who knows the person shown in the photograph, video 
or film, to give evidence as to his identity.  
26. 
 
In R v. Murphy, [1990] N.I. 19, the Northern Ireland Court 
of Appeal ruled that a photograph may be authenticated by someone 
other than the photographer who is able to identify the photograph by its 
subject matter. In this case, the Court dealt with the admissibility of 
visual evidence, including video footage and, by extension, similar types 
of evidence, such as photographs. In this case, one of the core issues was 
whether the video evidence, consisting of heli-tele footage and a 
European cameraman’s film, could be admitted without the original film 
or the cameraman’s testimony. The Court ruled that such evidence could 

Crl. Appeal No.531/2020 
 
- 10 -
be admitted, emphasizing the need for the evidence to be reliable and 
authentic, even if the person who captured the images was not available 
to testify. This ruling established a precedent that video and 
photographic evidence can be admissible under certain conditions, even 
if the source is not available, as long as the court is satisfied with the 
reliability and authenticity of the evidence. 
27. 
 
The United States and the United Kingdom both recognize 
the importance of adapting the above principles to new forms of digital 
evidence. The same requirements of relevance, authenticity, and 
avoidance of undue prejudice apply to them, with additional precautions 
to guard against manipulation. If there are challenges to the authenticity 
of digital evidence, expert testimony or forensic analysis may be 
required to prove that the image has not been altered or tampered with. 
Courts remain focused on ensuring that the chain of custody is 
maintained to demonstrate the photograph’s integrity from its creation to 
its presentation in court. 
28. 
 
In Pakistan, the Qanun-e-Shahadat 1984 (QSO) is the 
primary law on evidence, which mirrors many of the principles found in 
common law jurisdictions. According to Article (2)(1)(b) of the QSO, 
“document” means any matter expressed or described upon any 
substance by means of letters, figures, or marks or by more than one of 
those means, intended to be used, or which may be used, to record that 
matter. The illustrations in Article 2(1)(b) explain that words printed, 
lithographed, or photographed are considered as documents. Thus, a 
photograph falls within the aforesaid definition of “document”.7 
Photographs are treated as documentary evidence under Article 2(c). 
Article 78 requires that documentary evidence, including photographs, 
be authenticated. 
                                          
7 Article 2(1)(b) of Qanun-e-Shahadat 1984 defines “document” in almost the same words as section 
29 PPC though it gives its own Illustrations. Section 3(16) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 states: 
(16) 
“Document” shall include any matter written, expressed or described upon any 
substance by means of letters, figures or marks, or by more than one of those means which is 
intended to be used, or which may be used, for the purpose of recording that matter. 
Section 2(m) of the Electronic Transactions Ordinance, 2002, defines “electronic  document” as 
follows: 
“electronic document” includes documents, records, information, communications or 
transactions in electronic form. 
The definitions given in section 3(16) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 and section 2(m) of the 
Electronic Transactions Ordinance, 2002, are inclusive. 

Crl. Appeal No.531/2020

29. 
 
Article 72 of the QSO stipulates that the contents of 
documents may be proved by primary or secondary evidence. Article 73 
explains that primary evidence means the document itself produced for 
the court’s inspection. Explanation 2 to Article 73 reads: “Where a 
number of documents are all made by one uniform process as in the case 
of printing, lithography or photography, each is primary evidence of the 
contents of the rest, but where they are all copies of a common original, 
they are not primary evidence of the contents of the original.” Article 74 
explains “secondary evidence”. Article 75 mandates that documents 
must be proved by primary evidence, while Article 76 outlines the 
situations in which court may allow secondary evidence relating to a 
document. Article 78 of the QSO requires that documentary evidence, 
including photographs, be authenticated.  
30. 
 
Given the above, if the photograph presented in court is an 
original print or created through a uniform process (e.g., digital copies 
from a camera), it qualifies as primary evidence and can be directly 
admitted. Each print or copy of the photograph created through the same 
photographic process can be considered primary evidence of its contents. 
The court can lawfully rely on it as primary evidence of the scene 
depicted in the image, even if multiple copies exist. However, if the 
photograph is a copy of an original, it cannot be considered primary 
evidence of the original. In such instances, the original should be 
produced, or secondary evidence must be justified under Article 76. 
31. 
 
As in the U.S. and U.K., a photograph can be authenticated 
by a witness familiar with the scene or object depicted in it. The 
photographer’s testimony is not always necessary.  
32. 
 
Article 164 of the QSO provides that the court may allow 
the production of any evidence that becomes available through modern 
devices or techniques. Digital photographs and electronic evidence are 
admissible under this provision if their authenticity is established 
through witness testimony or expert evidence. 
33. 
 
In the present case, the defence claimed that Rohi TV and 
the 24-News channel reported the incident and screened a photograph of 
the police officials with the recovered contraband. In this situation, the 

Crl. Appeal No.531/2020 
 
- 12 -
newsreel would be the primary evidence. The photograph produced in 
the court was not. It was neither the original nor authenticated as 
secondary evidence under Article 76 of the QSO. A photograph from a 
media report is inadmissible without proof of its source or creation. The 
trial court erred in treating it as admissible evidence and marking it as 
Exh. DA, overlooking its status as secondary evidence requiring 
authentication. Illustration (a) to Article 74 states that a photograph of an 
original is admissible only if the original is proven.8 
34. 
 
In conclusion, since the photograph Exh. DA was neither 
authenticated nor substantiated through secondary evidence, it is deemed 
inadmissible and is, therefore, de-exhibited. 
35. 
 
Now, we turn to the second part of the question: whether 
the statements of PWs Muhammad Iqbal and Karim Nawaz regarding 
the photograph Exh. DA are admissible. This question must be resolved 
in light of the principles set out in the QSO. 
36. 
 
A photograph (or any document) in possession of the cross-
examiner may be either admissible or inadmissible. If admissible, it can 
be introduced into evidence in its own right. Its evidentiary value stems 
from compliance with the principles of admissibility under the QSO. 
Articles 70, 71, 139, 140, and 151(3) collectively govern the evidentiary 
treatment of such material. Articles 70 and 71 permit a witness to testify 
about matters within their knowledge or perception. If the witness 
identifies the scene depicted in the photograph and their testimony aligns 
with their observations, their statements are admissible as direct 
evidence. Article 139 further allows the defence counsel to use the 
photograph to challenge the credibility of witnesses by comparing their 
statements during cross-examination with the scene shown in the 
photograph. If admitted, the photograph serves as substantive evidence, 
and Article 140 becomes relevant if it is used to refresh the witnesses’ 
memory. Article 151(3) further allows scrutiny of the witnesses’ 
credibility if inconsistencies or contradictions arise concerning the 
photograph. In short, when the photograph is authenticated and meets 
                                          
8 Illustration (a) to Article 74 of the QSO reads: 
(a) 
A photograph of an original is secondary evidence of its contents, though the two 
have not been compared, if it is proved that the thing photographed was the original.

the admissibility requirements, subsequent statements of the witnesses, 
reflecting their personal knowledge, are valid and admissible. 
37. 
 
Conversely, a different analysis applies if the photograph is 
inadmissible because it fails to qualify as primary evidence or lacks 
proper authentication as secondary evidence. Article 70 of the QSO 
mandates that all facts, except the contents of documents, may be proved 
by oral evidence, while Article 71 requires that oral evidence must be 
direct. This restricts a witness to testifying only about facts they have 
directly perceived. Observations made after being shown an inadmissible 
photograph do not meet this standard. In such a scenario, the application 
of Article 139 is limited, as a party cannot contradict a witness using 
inadmissible material. Similarly, Article 140 becomes irrelevant because 
an inadmissible photograph cannot serve to refresh memory. While 
Article 151(3) allows for impeaching the credibility of a witness, the 
defence cannot rely on inadmissible evidence for this purpose. 
Accordingly, the court must disregard the photograph and any derivative 
testimony based on it because admitting such statements would violate 
the principles of evidentiary integrity.

In R v. Treacy [1944] 2 All ER 229, the accused was 
charged with murder. During the trial, the prosecution introduced a 
statement made by the accused while he was in ill health, explaining 
why he had left the locality where the killing occurred and expressing 
fear that his past deeds, including the alleged murder, would be exposed. 
The prosecution also cross-examined the accused about two forged 
documents found in his possession, which were neither exhibited nor 
proved and whose existence was unknown to the defence. It was 
suggested that these documents were used to deceive the victim, 
although there was no evidence that the victim had seen them. 
Additionally, the prosecution contrasted the accused’s answers in court 
with an earlier inadmissible statement he had made. On appeal, it was 
held that the forged documents were irrelevant and should not have been 
put to the accused. Moreover, it was deemed improper and prejudicial to 
cross-examine upon the contents of an inadmissible document.

In R v. Gillespie (1967) 51 Cr App R 172, the accused were 
convicted of dishonesty in accounting to their employers for sums of

money less than those recorded in documents prepared by sales staff. 
The conviction was quashed on the ground that the prosecution, during 
cross-examination, had asked the accused to read aloud from documents 
prepared by a member of the sales staff who had not been called to 
testify. The court ruled that this amounted to an attempt by the 
prosecution to make inadmissible hearsay evidence admissible by 
merely putting it to the accused. 
40. 
 
The principle of law that emerges from the above 
discussion is that, under the QSO, the admissibility of the statement of a 
witness regarding a document depends on the admissibility of that 
document. In the present case, since the subject photograph is 
inadmissible, the statements made by PWs Muhammad Iqbal and Karim 
Nawaz concerning it are also inadmissible. These statements do not 
constitute direct evidence of the fact in issue; they are influenced by the 
photograph rather than the witnesses’ own perception. The photograph’s 
inadmissibility invalidates its use as a basis for questioning, rendering 
any testimony derived solely from it legally irrelevant. The principle of 
evidentiary integrity prohibits the court from relying on such derivative 
testimony. 
41. 
 
We have already questioned the credibility of the recovery 
process and expressed doubt about the veracity of the prosecution’s case. 
Consequently, even if the photograph Exh. DA (now de-exhibited) and 
the related portions of the cross-examination of PWs Muhammad Iqbal 
and Karim Nawaz are disregarded, it would not bolster the prosecution’s 
case and support a finding of guilt against the Appellant. The positive 
PFSA report (Exh. PE - Exh. PE/1) is also of no avail to the prosecution. 
42. 
 
It is a fundamental principle of law that the prosecution 
must establish its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and any doubt must 
benefit the accused.9 This high standard upholds the presumption of 
innocence and guards against wrongful convictions. Indeed, it is better 
for the guilty to go free than for one innocent person to be unjustly

punished.10 The Supreme Court of Pakistan has emphasized that, given 
the stringent punishments prescribed under the CNSA, courts must 
exercise extreme caution in such cases, ensuring they are fully convinced 
that the entire quantity allegedly seized from the accused is indeed a 
narcotic substance. The guiding principle for the safe administration of 
criminal justice is that the more severe the punishment, the higher the 
standard of proof required for conviction.11 In the present case, the 
prosecution’s evidence is insufficient to meet this standard.

The Appellant claimed that he was merely a passenger in 
the car and had no knowledge of the charas concealed in it. He further 
alleged that the actual driver, Fazal Hussain, was transporting the 
contraband whom the police released after receiving a bribe. While the 
Appellant did not produce independent evidence to substantiate this plea, 
his failure does not absolve the prosecution of its obligation to prove the 
charge independently. It is a cardinal principle of law that the 
prosecution must stand on its own legs and cannot rely on weaknesses in 
the defence case to secure a conviction. In this instance, the prosecution 
has failed to discharge its burden, so the benefit of the doubt must be 
extended to the accused. 
44. 
 
In view of the above, we accept Crl. Appeal No.531/2020, 
set aside the conviction and sentence awarded to the Appellant and 
acquit him of the charge. He shall be released from jail forthwith if not 
required in some other case.
