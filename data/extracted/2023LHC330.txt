             Rasaal Hasan Syed, J. This Constitutional petition 
calls into question orders of the forums below in terms 
whereof petitioner’s application for setting aside of ex parte 
proceedings order was dismissed, an ex parte ejectment order 
was passed, and the order was affirmed in appeal. 
2. 
Sajjad Ahmad/respondent No.3, on 30.11.2018 filed an 
ejectment petition under section 19 of the Punjab Rented 
Premises Act, 2009 (the “Act”) for the eviction of the 
petitioner from a house, inter alia on the ground of expiry of 
lease; default in payment of rent and use of property for 
different purposes. Notice was issued whereafter on the report 
of Process Server about service, ex parte proceedings order 
was passed against him on 10.1.2019. An application for 
setting aside of ex parte proceedings order dated 10.1.2019 
was moved which was followed by applications for leave to 
contest and for condonation of delay. The applications were 

        W.P. No.17643 of 2020

declined vide order dated 16.5.2019 and an ex parte ejectment 
order was passed on 27.5.2019. These orders were challenged 
in appeal which was dismissed by the learned Addl. District 
Judge vide order dated 27.2.2020. In the instant petition these 
orders are under challenge. 
3. 
Learned counsel submits that the provisions of section 
21 of the Act ibid. were completely misread and mis-
interpreted; no notice as per schedule attached to the Act 
along with the relevant documents was ever served upon the 
petitioner; the petitioner was never personally served with 
any notice; the signatures on the report of the Process Server 
did not mention CNIC number, nor the name of the person 
who allegedly identified the petitioner or his residence or in 
whose presence the notice was allegedly delivered was 
recorded; that there was no legal service and that the 
petitioner acquired knowledge of the ex parte proceedings 
only when the commission came to inspect the site in terms 
of order of Rent Tribunal; the application was within time 
from the date of knowledge and that the leave to contest 
application was also not considered in accordance with law 
on merits; the entire proceedings were illegal and that the 
relationship of landlord and tenant did not exist between the 
parties; civil litigation was pending in respect of the property; 
the rule of natural justice requires that the case be heard and 
tried on merits after giving opportunity of leave to contest. 
Contrarily respondent’s learned counsel supported the 
impugned order and maintained that the petitioner had 

        W.P. No.17643 of 2020  
 
 
 
 
Page-3 
 
 
 
knowledge of the proceedings who did not turn up and that no 
sufficient cause was shown for the setting aside of ex parte 
proceedings order and that the application for setting aside of 
ex parte proceedings order was not accompanied with an 
application for leave to contest and that the forum below 
rightly declined to set aside the impugned order and also the 
consequential orders passed by the forum below. 
4. 
Points raised for and against have been considered, 
copies of the material documents and order-sheet have been 
examined. In the instant case the petitioner was proceeded 
against ex parte by the Rent Tribunal; his application for 
setting aside of ex parte proceedings orders was dismissed; 
leave to contest was not considered on merits and an ex parte  
order of eviction was passed against him. The foundational 
objection of the petitioner qua  the ex parte proceedings order 
was that no notice as contemplated by the provisions of 
section 21 of the Act was ever served or delivered to the 
petitioner and that the petitioner did not receive any notice  
which was purportedly sent through Process Server and that 
the petitioner came to know about the proceedings when he 
appeared before the local commission who visited the site in 
terms of the subsequent order of the Rent Tribunal 
whereupon he moved the application for setting aside of ex 
parte proceedings and also moved an application for leave to 
contest.  
5. 
Application for eviction was instituted under section 
19 of the Act which mandates that the same shall contain a 

        W.P. No.17643 of 2020  
 
 
 
 
Page-4 
 
 
 
concise statement of facts, the relief claimed and shall be 
accompanied by copies of all relevant documents in 
possession of the applicant and if the application is for the 
eviction of tenant, the landlord shall submit his affidavit and 
affidavits of not more than two witnesses along with the 
eviction application. Section 21 of the Act provided for the 
procedure to be followed in the matter of service of tenant. In 
terms thereof the notice shall be issued to the respondent in 
the form prescribed in the schedule, for appearance on the 
date not later than ten days through Process Server, 
Registered Post A.D. and courier service. Sub-section (3) of 
section 21 of the Act provides that the notice if not served, 
the service of notice may be secured through affixation of 
notice at a conspicuous part of the rented premises and by 
publication in the press, electronic media or any other mode. 
The Rent Tribunal can proceed ex parte only after the notice 
was served in accordance with the provisions of law. It is 
discernible from the file that the eviction application was 
instituted on 30.11.2018; Rent Tribunal directed the deposit 
of 10% of annual value of rent as penalty in the Government 
Treasury in terms of section 9(b) of the Act vide order dated 
30.11.2018; on 12.12.2018 notice was ordered to be issued to 
the respondent through Registered Post A.D., T.C.S. and 
Process Server for 10.1.2019 and on the said date the 
respondent was proceeded against ex parte. In the order it was 
observed that “… As per report the service of respondent has 
been effected personally but neither respondent nor any one 

        W.P. No.17643 of 2020  
 
 
 
 
Page-5 
 
 
 
appeared on behalf of the respondent despite service. Let the 
exparte proceedings are hereby (sic) initiated against the 
respondent. Now to come up for ex parte petitioner evidence 
for 31-1-2019”.  It was the case of the petitioner that he did 
not receive any notice nor any notice in terms of section 21 of 
the Act was ever issued or served along with requisite 
documents. Perusal of the report of Process Server placed at 
page 29 of this petition reveals that it lacked compliance with 
the mandatory provisions of law. The Process Server reported 
that he went at the address, inquired about the petitioner, who 
met him and received the notice. Perusal of the report shows 
that it does not indicate as to who identified the petitioner and 
in whose presence the notice was delivered. So much so, no 
CNIC of the addressee is mentioned nor any copy of the same 
was secured. Obviously, the Process Server did not claim that 
he knew the petitioner. It was necessary for him to have 
mentioned the name of person who had identified the 
addressee and in whose presence he had allegedly delivered 
the notice. Similarly, the report does not indicate if any 
document as contemplated by section 21 of the Act was ever 
delivered. The notice was on a printed form which did not 
contain any handwritten note of Ahlmad about the annexures, 
if annexed with the notice.  A copy of the postal receipt in 
respect of registration of the notice was placed on record but 
no “acknowledgement due” showing any service of the notice 
was placed on record. The Rent Tribunal did not deem it 
necessary to examine the Process Server with a view to 

        W.P. No.17643 of 2020  
 
 
 
 
Page-6 
 
 
 
satisfy the manner in which he allegedly delivered the notice 
and to whom it was delivered and casually proceeded to pass 
an order for ex parte proceedings. It is a settled law that all 
possible efforts should be made to ensure and satisfy that the 
opposite side in a case was actually served so as to enable the 
said party to defend himself and take necessary measures to 
protect his rights in the proceedings. In this case neither any 
statement of Process Server was recorded nor any 
acknowledgement due was placed on record nor any 
publication was made instead the ex parte proceedings order 
was passed in a routine manner which could not be approved. 
6. 
Petitioner’s case was that he came to know about the 
pending proceedings before the Rent Tribunal when the local 
commission inspected the site. With a view to consider this 
plea it will be necessary to examine the subsequent events. 
Order-sheet reveals that on 04.3.2019 ex parte documentary 
evidence of the respondent was received, and case was 
adjourned for final arguments. On 14.3.2019 the Rent 
Tribunal passed the following order: 
 
“Final arguments heard. Record perused. 
 
2. 
Perusal of the record shows that instant ejectment 
petition has been filed on the basis of written agreement of 
tenancy and the agreement of rent is not registered and 
unregistered documents does not create any right in-favour 
of parties. On the other hand, respondent has been ex-parte 
proceeded. Being Rent Tribunal at first this court has to 
satisfy itself that the dispute is regarding tenancy between 
landlord and tenant. Keeping in view hardship of innocent 
people and for satisfaction of this court local inspection of 
demise property is necessary, therefore, by invoking power 
under section 26 of PRPA 2009,  Mr.  Farman Ahmad Bhatti 
Advocate Cell No. 0307-6949866 is appointed as local 
commission. Local commission is directed to visit the suit 

        W.P. No.17643 of 2020  
 
 
 
 
Page-7 
 
 
 
property after sending prior notices to both the parties and 
submit his report on the following points: 
 
 
(i). 
Who is in possession over demise property? 
 
 
(ii) 
What is the status of the demised premises? 
 
 
(iii) 
Under what capacity he is in possession? 
 
 
3. 
Fee of local commission is fixed Rs. 15,000/- which 
shall be paid by the petitioner within two days. Local 
commission is also directed to capture the photograph of 
demise property, prepare site plan & record statements of 
parties and persons of locality. 
4. 
Now to come up also for report of local commission on   
25.3.2019”. 
7. 
Pursuant to the order of the Rent Tribunal the Local 
Commission visited the site, recorded the statement of 
petitioner Waqar Ahmad, respondent Sajjad Ahmad and 
other witnesses. In his statement petitioner deposed that he 
was owner of the house, he had not sold the same, the sale 
deed claimed by the respondent was forged one; the 
petitioner was never a tenant in the property and that the 
ejectment petition was baseless and that he would appear 
before the Rent Tribunal on 25.10.2019 and will affirm that 
he had not sold his house nor he was a tenant of anyone. In 
his report dated 04.4.2019 the Local Commission reported 
that he visited the site on 21.3.2019, recorded the statements 
of the parties and the witnesses and that as per the stance of 
the petitioner Waqar Ali he had not received any notice of 
ejectment petition and that he had not sold the property and 
was in possession as owner and not as tenant and that the sale 
deed was forged one. 
8. 
Deeper analysis of the circumstances noted supra, 
shows that there was serious issue as to the service of notice 

        W.P. No.17643 of 2020  
 
 
 
 
Page-8 
 
 
 
and also the legality of the proceedings by the Rent Tribunal 
in as much as the petitioner had denied receipt of notice; the 
delivery of any notice along with documents in terms of the 
provisions of section 21 of the Act and claimed acquisition of 
knowledge of the proceedings only when the Commission 
inspected the site on 21.3.2019 whereafter he moved an 
application for setting aside of ex parte proceedings order. 
The application was, therefore, filed within 04 days from the 
acquisition of knowledge. An application for leave to contest 
was also moved on the next date along with application for 
condonation of delay. It is also observed that the Process 
Server did not mention the name of the identifier who had 
identified the addressee; the report is not witnessed by any 
person; the report does not indicate as to how the Process 
Server came to know that the person whom he was delivering 
the notice was the petitioner and that no CNIC number was 
mentioned in the report. In the peculiar circumstances, the 
Rent Tribunal was under obligation to have had recorded 
statement of the Process Server to find out the manner in 
which the report was made about the service of the petitioner; 
but such exercise was not undertaken. So much so that the 
postal receipt of the registered notice was placed on the 
record but no “acknowledgement due” was either placed on 
record or claimed to have been received by the Rent Tribunal 
after due service. In these circumstances, there was no legal 
or proper service of the petitioner on which the Rent Tribunal 
could casually proceed ex parte against him. Even otherwise 

        W.P. No.17643 of 2020  
 
 
 
 
Page-9 
 
 
 
the fact that the Rent Tribunal after recording ex parte 
evidence was not satisfied with the existence of tenancy and 
as such proceeded to pass an order for the appointment of 
local commission to visit the site and report as to who was in 
possession of the property; what was the status of the 
demised premises; and under what capacity the person who is 
occupying the property was in possession and in his report 
the local commission reported that he had recorded the 
statement of the petitioner who had denied the tenancy, 
disputed the sale deed, termed the same as forged and 
claimed to be in occupancy of property as owner in 
possession and stated that he would appear before the Rent 
Tribunal on the date fixed i.e. 25.3.2019 and will explain  the 
true state of affairs at site which he did. The petitioner filed 
the application with affidavit for setting aside of ex parte 
proceedings order on 25.3.2019 which on the face of it was 
not barred by time. The facts stated and circumstances as 
appear on record, would show that there were sufficient 
reasons  for setting aside of ex parte proceedings order; more 
so when the respondent claimed to have purchased the 
property through the petitioner and also claimed him to be his 
tenant and the response of the petitioner was that he had 
never executed any sale deed nor sold the property nor 
executed the Rent Note while the respondent was claiming 
the alleged execution of rent deed on 02.8.2016 and the sale 
deed in his favour  on 12.1.2017. Obviously, the execution of 
Rent Note was claimed by respondent on a date when no sale 

        W.P. No.17643 of 2020  
 
 
 
 
Page-10 
 
 
 
deed had been executed in his favour. All these 
circumstances and facts constituted a case for grant of leave 
to contest to the petitioner. The Rent Tribunal assumed the 
knowledge on the basis of a statement allegedly made by the 
respondent in other proceedings of the civil suit in the 
presence of a counsel without claiming the petitioner’s 
presence in the court at that stage or without formally 
bringing the documents in evidence and by confronting the 
petitioner with the same. In any case the foundational order 
of ex parte proceedings being illegal and violative by law, the 
application for setting aside of ex parte order could not be 
rejected on erroneous assumption as to the knowledge. The 
requirements of the provisions of section 21 of Act have been 
considered in number of cases by this Court wherein it was 
observed that if the notice has not been served actually upon 
the tenant in the manner as prescribed by schedule annexed 
to the Act and along with the documents like pleadings, 
affidavits and other appended documents, the opposite side 
could not be non-suited on the plea that application was not 
accompanied by the application for Leave to Contest or filed 
later. Reference can be made to the cases of “Mureed 
Hussain v. Additional District Judge and others” (2018 
MLD 162), “Bakht Munir v. Qadir Khan and another” 
(PLD 2014 Lah. 87), “Babar Ali v. Additional District 
Judge, Sargodha and 2 others” (2012 YLR 2933) and 
“Younas Siddique v. Mst. Tahira Jabeen” (PLD 2009 Lah. 
469).

For the reasons above, this petition is allowed, 
impugned orders are declared to be illegal and without lawful 
authority and violative of law and are accordingly set aside. 
In result, the ejectment petition shall be deemed to be 
pending which shall now be decided by the Rent Tribunal 
after giving opportunity of evidence to both sides in 
accordance with law and on merits.
