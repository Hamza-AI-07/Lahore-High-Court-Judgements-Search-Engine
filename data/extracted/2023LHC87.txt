Through 
this 
Constitutional 
Petition, 
petitioners have called in question order dated 
24.01.2023 
(Impugned 
Order) 
issued 
by 
respondent No.2 (Secretary Law and Parliamentary 
Affairs Department, Government of Punjab) 
whereby it has been conveyed that the competent 
authority is pleased to dispense with services of 
Additional Advocates General and Assistant 
Advocates General mentioned in the said order. 
2. 
It is contended by learned counsel for the 
petitioners that caretaker Government in terms of 
Section 230 of the Election Act, 2017 can only 
perform its function to attend to day to day matters 
which are necessary to run the affairs of the 
Government and cannot make changes of 
permanent nature and pass order that have 
permanence attachment to the same. Moreover, in 
terms of subsection 2(e)(f) of the said Section the 
caretaker Government has been restrained from 
making promotions or major appointments of 
public officials, however, may make acting or 
short terms appointments and that too only in 
public interest but is not authorized to set aside the 

 
W.P. No. 5055 of 2023 
2 
 
appointments of previously appointed persons or 
transfer public officials unless it is considered 
expedient and that too after approval of the 
Election Commission of Pakistan, therefore, the 
impugned order dispensing with the services of the 
present petitioners is beyond the jurisdiction of 
caretaker Government and is not sustainable. 
Reliance in this behalf is placed upon judgment 
reported as “Raja Muhammad Zubair and others 
Vs. Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through 
Chief Secretary and others” (PLD 2022 Peshawar 
100) wherein the removal/dismissal/termination 
/reduction in rank to the extent of Additional 
Advocates General and Assistant Advocates 
General were declared as void ab-initio and non est 
in the eye of law. Reliance is also placed on 
judgments reported as “Government of Balochistan 
through 
Secretary 
Services 
and 
General 
Administration Department and others Vs. Abdul 
Rauf and others” (PLD 2021 SC 313) and 
“Khawaja Muhammad Asif Vs. Federation of 
Pakistan and others” (2013 SCMR 1205) to state 
that making decisions of permanent nature and 
passing orders having permanence attached to the 
same are not within the domain of the caretaker 
Government as the purpose of appointment of 
caretaker Government is only to facilitate the 
Election Commission of Pakistan to hold free and 
fair election and the same cannot be used for the 
benefit or detriment of either political party. 
Reliance is also placed on judgment reported as 
“Messrs Mustafa Impex, Karachi and others Vs. 
The Government of Pakistan through Secretary 
Finance, Islamabad and others” (PLD 2016 SC 

 
W.P. No. 5055 of 2023 
3 
 
808) to state that appointments of Additional 
Advocates General and Assistant Advocates 
General are made by the Government in terms of 
para No. 1.18, Chapter 1 of Law Department 
Manual, 1934 which means by the Cabinet and not 
by the Chief Minister of caretaker Government 
who is presently working alone and Cabinet has 
not yet been appointed, therefore, this dispensing 
with services of petitioners even otherwise was not 
within the sole discretionary jurisdiction of the 
Chief Minister, hence, the impugned order is not 
sustainable on that account as well. Further states 
that no process, whatsoever, was undertaken while 
passing the impugned order by just a single stroke 
of pen which is not justified. 
3. 
On the other hand, learned Additional 
Advocate 
General 
and 
Assistant 
Advocate 
General, who have appeared on behalf of caretaker 
Government of Punjab have defended the 
impugned order by stating that present order has 
been issued for facilitating the holding of free and 
fair elections as the previously appointed officers 
in the office of Advocate General, Punjab were 
representatives of political parties forming the 
previous Government and their retention in service 
in the office of Advocate General would not be of 
any benefit to Election Commission of Pakistan to 
hold free and fair elections rather may be a 
hindrance to same. In terms of rule 14(1) of Punjab 
Government Rules of Business, 2011 read with 
Entry No.16 of its Schedule No.7, Chief Minister 
is fully authorized and competent to appoint and 
remove officers in the office of Advocate General 
without there being any recourse to Provincial 

 
W.P. No. 5055 of 2023 
4 
 
Cabinet which power could be exercised even 
when the Cabinet was not constituted. Further 
relies upon judgment reported as “Imtiaz Ahmad 
Kaifi Vs. Government of Punjab, etc.” (PLD 2013 
Lahore 598) to state that this Court in the afore-
referred judgment did not set aside order 
dispensing with services of Additional Advocates 
General and Assistant Advocates General on the 
ground that caretaker Government had no 
jurisdiction to dispense with their services rather 
the said order was set aside on the ground of 
discrimination as services of some of the officers 
of Advocate General office were retained whereas 
services of other officers were dispensed with and 
then the Advocate General could not justify before 
the Court the criteria employed for the purpose of 
retaining certain officers while dispensing with 
services of the others. Further states that Law 
Department Manual, 1934 was framed prior to 
creation of Pakistan, therefore, to interpret the 
word “Government” in the same on the principles 
laid down in Mustafa Impex case (supra) as 
Cabinet is not justified and the said term 
“Government” is to be treated as head of 
Government and not the Cabinet as a whole. 
4. 
Furthermore, 
reliance 
is 
placed 
upon 
paragraph No.18 of the case reported as 
“Agriculture Workers’ Union, Balochistan, Quetta 
and others Vs. The Registrar of Trade Unions, 
Balochistan, Quetta and others” (1997 SCMR 66) 
to state that where Judge of this Court who 
rendered a judgment is elevated to Honourable 
Supreme Court of Pakistan then the judgment 
passed by the said Judge would be entitled to the 

 
W.P. No. 5055 of 2023 
5 
 
highest consideration, therefore, principles laid 
down in case of Imtiaz Ahmad Kaifi (supra) would 
be applicable to the case in terms whereof the 
order dispensing with services of Additional 
Advocates General and Assistant Advocates 
General could be set aside on the basis of 
discrimination only and on no other ground; as no 
discrimination has been done in dispensing with 
the services of all law officers of Advocate 
General office, hence, stance of the petitioners is 
not justified. Further states that reliance placed by 
the petitioners on Khawaja Asif’s case (supra) is 
not justified as the said case related to public 
servants who held posts of permanent nature and 
not to the law officers of office of Advocate 
General who hold the office during the pleasure of 
the Governor who has ordered to relieve them in 
the public interest to facilitate the Election 
Commission of Pakistan in conduct of free and fair 
elections to provide proper mandate to the next 
elected Government; besides, the said order is 
justified in view of clauses „g‟ and „i‟ of 
notification 
dated 
22.01.2023 
of 
Election 
Commission of Pakistan which provides for 
immediate termination of services of all head of 
institutions appointed on political basis. 
 
Further states that judgment referred by the 
petitioners titled as “Government of Balochistan 
through 
Secretary 
Service 
and 
General 
Administration Department and others Vs. Abdul 
Rauf and others” (PLD 2021 SC 313) is not 
relevant to the case of appointment in the office of 
Advocate General, therefore, same cannot be relied 
upon.

5. 
At this stage learned counsel for the 
petitioners have pointed out that although the 
petitioners and other law officers of the office of 
Advocate General Punjab have been relieved by 
treating them as representatives of previous 
coalition Government of Punjab but the officers 
who have been appointed in their place were same 
officers who had been previously appointed in the 
office 
of 
Advocate 
General 
and 
were 
representatives of political parties who had formed 
Government 
previous 
to 
the 
erstwhile 
Government, hence, the argument that petitioners 
being representatives of political parties had been 
relieved for the purpose of holding free and fair 
elections was without any substance. 
6. 
In view of the pro and contra arguments of 
both the parties and principles of judgments 
referred by them (supra), inter alia following 
points need consideration :- 
i. 
Whether definition of „Government‟ 
as mentioned in Mustafa Impex case 
(supra) would be applicable in the 
present case; 
ii. 
Whether the impugned order passed 
by the respondent/Province of Punjab 
falls within the scope of day to day 
affairs that are to be taken care of by 
the caretaker Government; 
iii. 
Whether the caretaker Government/ 
Chief Minister was vested with 
jurisdiction to dispense with services 
of law officers serving in the 
Advocate General‟s office and if yes, 
could 
he 
act 
solely 
without 

 
W.P. No. 5055 of 2023 
7 
 
appointment of Cabinet and pass the 
order to dispense with the services of 
the present petitioners and other law 
officers serving in the office of 
Advocate General; 
iv. 
Whether 
already 
appointed 
law 
officers 
could 
be 
treated 
as 
representatives of political parties for 
relieving them from the office of 
Advocate General for the purpose of 
holding free and fair elections, 
especially when the claim of the 
petitioners is that most of the 
respondents appointed in their places 
had previously been employed by the 
Government who had held office prior 
to the erstwhile Government; 
v. 
Whether and to what extent, the 
principles laid down by the judgments 
referred to above by the parties, are 
applicable to the present case. 
7. 
Notice be issued to respondents with 
direction to official respondents to file report and 
parawise comments, for 07.02.2023. Notice shall 
also be issued in terms of Order XXVII-A of 
C.P.C. to Advocate General Punjab as well as 
Attorney General for Pakistan. 
C.M. No. 01 of 2023 
8. 
Notice for the aforesaid date. Till next date 
of hearing, operation of the impugned order only 
to the extent of dispensing with services of present 
petitioners, shall remain suspended, however, this 
shall not adversely affect the fresh appointments of

respondents as law officers in the office of 
Advocate General, Punjab. 
C.M. No.02 of 2023

to all just and legal exceptions. C.M. stands 
disposed of.
