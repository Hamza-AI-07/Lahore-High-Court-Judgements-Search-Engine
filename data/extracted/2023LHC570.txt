JUDGMENT 
 
Dates of hearing 
18.01.2023 & 27.02.2023 
For the Petitioner: 
Mr. Shahid Azeem, Advocate. 
For the State: 
Rana Tasawar Ali Khan, Deputy Prosecutor 
General, with Wali Muhammad/SI, and Zulfiqar 
Ahmad Butt, Motor Registring Authority-VI. 
For Respondent No.4: 
Mr. Shahid Ali Shakir, Advocate. 
 
 
 
Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – On 4.6.2022, vide Rapt No.2/5, 
Shafqat Ali/SI of Police Station took into custody Toyota Corolla GLI 
Car No.LWP-0507, Engine No.X443887, Chasis No.NZE-1206038938  
(the “Car”) under section 550 Cr.P.C. from Hassan Raza, the son of 
Respondent No.4. The Petitioner and Respondent No.4 filed two 
separate applications before the Judicial Magistrate, Jaranwala, for 
custody (superdari) of the Car. The Judicial Magistrate dismissed the 
Petitioner’s application and allowed that of Respondent No.4 by order 
dated 7.6.2022. The Petitioner filed a revision petition thereagainst in the 
Sessions Court, Jaranwala, which the Additional Sessions Judge 
dismissed on 14.7.2022. The Petitioner has now assailed these orders 
through this petition under section 561-A Cr.P.C. before this Court. 
2. 
 
The Petitioner’s counsel, Mr. Shahid Azeem, Advocate, 
contends that the Petitioner is the owner of the Car, and it is in his name 
in the record of the Motor Registering Authority (“MRA”). Respondent 
No.4 is an Inspector in the Punjab Police. While posted at Depalpur, he 
borrowed the Car from him for a short time. However, he didn’t give it 

Crl. Misc. No.51580/M/2022 
 
- 2 - 
back, and when the Petitioner insisted, he used his clout and had it seized 
by Police Station Buchyana, Jaranwala, District Faisalabad, under 
section 550 Cr.P.C. The counsel states that Respondent No.4 has no right 
or interest in the Car, and its original papers are with the Petitioner 
(which he also produced before this Court during the hearing). 
3. 
 
Mr. Shahid Ali Shakir, Advocate, states that Respondent 
No.4 purchased the Car from Muhammad Ahmad, son of Muhammad 
Jaffar, and he is its current lawful owner. According to Rapt No.5 dated 
4.6.2022, the police seized the Car from Hassan Raza, the son of 
Respondent No.4. Therefore, for all legal and practical purposes, 
Respondent No.4 was the last possessor. The counsel strongly refutes the 
Petitioner’s claim that he was the vehicle’s owner and that he obliged 
Respondent No.4 and entrusted it to him for temporary use. Mr. Shakir 
produced the Car’s original registration book, the Transfer Deed 
executed by Muhammad Ahmad in favour of Respondent No.4, and the 
certificate dated 18.7.2011 issued by the Faysal Bank Limited to support 
his contentions. 
4. 
 
Muhammad Ahmad has also appeared before this Court in 
support of Respondent No.4. Although the Petitioner has not impleaded 
him in the petition, I have allowed him to make submissions to meet the 
ends of justice. He states that on 9.8.2010 he sold the Car to Respondent 
No.4 for Rs.950,000/-, and the same day, handed over its possession to 
him along with the documents mentioned in the preceding paragraph. 
Muhammad Ahmad further states that he swore an affidavit dated 
7.6.2022 to that effect and submitted it to the Judicial Magistrate when 
he heard the superdari application. He stands by the said affidavit, which 
is part of the record. 
5. 
 
In rebuttal, Mr. Azeem submits that when the Petitioner 
gave the Car to Respondent No.4, its original registration book and other 
papers were in the glove compartment which went with it. As regards the 
Transfer Deed produced by Mr. Shakir, he submits that it is collusive 
and an attempt to defraud the Petitioner. Muhammad Ahmad is playing 
in the hands of Respondent No.4. On 21.6.2022, he also applied to the 
MRA for the change of ownership and transfer of title of the Car in the 

Crl. Misc. No.51580/M/2022 
 
- 3 - 
name of Respondent No.4. The MRA dismissed his application vide 
order dated 23.8.2022. 
6. 
 
The Judicial Magistrate granted the Car’s superdari to 
Respondent No.4 on three grounds: first, the Petitioner had failed to 
explain how it reached Respondent No.4; second, Respondent No.4 had 
the Car’s original registration book and the Transfer Deed, which 
Muhammad Ahmad vouched; third, Respondent No.4 was the last 
possessor of the Car. The Additional Sessions Judge agreed on all these 
points while affirming his order. 
Opinion 
7. 
 
Section 550 Cr.P.C. empowers a police officer to seize any 
property that may be alleged or suspected to have been stolen or may be 
found under circumstances that raise suspicion that an offence has been 
committed. In Hassan Muhammad v. Nazar Hussain and others  
(2005 SCMR 1063), the parties had a dispute regarding the performance 
of an agreement and, resultantly, the ownership of the tractor. The 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan held the civil court was the proper 
forum for its resolution. The police could not seize the tractor under 
section 550 Cr.P.C. They could exercise power under the said provision 
only if the property was stolen or suspected it was involved in the 
commission of an offence. 
8. 
 
Sections 523 to 525 Cr.P.C. outline the procedure for 
disposal of the seized property. Section 523 directs the police to report 
the matter to a Magistrate immediately after the seizure. In Akhtar 
Hussain v. Station House Officer and others (2007 PCr.LJ 1552), this 
Court held that their holding of the property is illegal if they do not do 
so. Section 523 requires the Magistrate to deliver the seized property to 
the person entitled to its possession or make such other order respecting 
its disposal as he thinks fit. However, it is well settled that the 
proceedings before the Magistrate are summary. He cannot conduct a 
detailed inquiry because it is the realm of the civil court. 
9. 
 
When the police seize a vehicle, and a person applies for its 
superdari, the Magistrate sometimes calls a report from the MRA. At 

Crl. Misc. No.51580/M/2022 
 
- 4 - 
times one of the interested parties asks the MRA1 to investigate the title 
of its rival and cancel his registration – as happened in the present case. 
Therefore, it is necessary first to define the precise nature, scope, and 
extent of the MRA’s jurisdiction. 
10. 
 
The 
Motor 
Vehicles 
Ordinance 
XIX 
of 
1965  
(the “Ordinance”) regulates motor vehicles in the province. According to 
section 2(23) thereof, “motor vehicle means any mechanically propelled 
vehicle adapted for use upon roads, whether the power of propulsion is 
transmitted thereto from an external or internal source, and includes a 
chassis to which a body has not been attached or a tractor and a trailer; a 
combined harvester, a rig, a fork lifter, a road roller, construction, and 
earth moving machinery, such as a wheel loader, a crane, an excavator, a 
grader, a dozer and a pipe layer, a road making and a road/sewerage 
cleaning plant but does not include a vehicle running upon fixed rails or 
used solely upon the premises of the owner.” Section 23(1) states that no 
one shall drive any vehicle, and no motor vehicle owner shall cause or 
permit his vehicle to be driven in any place unless it is registered under 
Chapter III and has a registration mark displayed in the prescribed 
manner. Sections 24 to 28 set out the procedure for registering a motor 
vehicle. Section 32 speaks of the subsequent transfer of ownership. It 
stipulates that the transferee shall, within 30 days of the transfer of 
ownership of a motor vehicle registered under the Ordinance, report the 
transfer to the MRA within whose jurisdiction he ordinarily resides 
along with the prescribed documents as proof of the change of 
ownership and payment of the prescribed fee. The MRA shall update the 
records and issue a new registration certificate. Section 34 enumerates 
the instances under which the MRA may suspend a motor vehicle 
registration certificate, and section 35 lists the circumstances under 
which the MRA may cancel it.  
                                          
1 The expression “Registering Authority” is explained in Rule 28 of the Punjab Motor Vehicles Rules, 
1969 as below: 
28. 
Registering Authority. – (1) The Registering Authority shall be the 
District Officer/Excise and Taxation Officer or Deputy District Officer/Excise and 
Taxation Officer, as the case may be, appointed by the Government to discharge the 
functions and perform the duties as such, in any specified area. 
(2) 
The area of jurisdiction of each Registering Authority shall be the area of 
the District. 
(3)

The Hon’ble Supreme Court noted in Amjad Ali Khan v. 
The State and others (PLD 2020 SC 299) that section 27 of the 
Ordinance requires the production of the vehicle before the MRA (or any 
authority as the Government may appoint for that purpose) for physical 
verification so that it may satisfy itself that the particulars contained in 
the application are true and the vehicle complies with the requirements 
of Chapter VI and the Rules thereunder. It held that physical verification 
has many advantages and is thus equally applicable to subsequent 
transfers under section 32. The relevant excerpt is reproduced below: 
“The importance of physical verification remains equally important in 
subsequent transfers, as has come to surface in the instant case, where 
a vehicle allegedly involved in the commission of a crime, which had 
been seized by the police and was a case property in a criminal case, 
yet it was registered in the name of the petitioner on the basis of 
wrongful assumption that the transferor holds an absolute legal title of 
the vehicle and is in lawful possession of the same. The application 
for registration (Form F) or the application for transfer of ownership, 
rests upon a fundamental assumption that the vehicle is in lawful 
ownership and possession of the owner of the vehicle. In order to 
effectively regulate the vehicles under [the Ordinance], physical 
verification of the vehicle at the time of registration and its 
subsequent registration is critical. It is also in the public interest 
besides advancing the purposes of [the Ordinance]. Physical 
verification of the vehicle also helps actualize sections 34 and 35 of 
[the Ordinance] dealing with suspension and cancellation of 
registration of the vehicle. We, therefore, hold that the requirement of 
section 27 regarding physical verification of the vehicle prior to 
registration is an essential requirement and is fully applicable to 
subsequent 
registration 
of 
vehicles 
under 
section 
32 
of 
[the Ordinance].” 
12. 
 
There is no provision in the Ordinance, including sections 
34 or 35, which authorizes the MRA to hear an application questioning 
the ownership of a motor vehicle. That is the exclusive jurisdiction of the 
civil court. In Mst. Shaheen Begum v. SHO (ACLC) and others  
(2005 MLD 176), the Sindh High Court considered whether the MRA 
could adjudicate upon and give a finding on the legality of a sale 
transaction and the title of a party. It ruled that the party claiming breach 
of contract or trust should file a civil suit. It has no remedy under 
sections 34 or 35 of the Ordinance. Clause (e) of section 34(1) of the 
Ordinance, which provides that the MRA may suspend the registration 
certificate of a vehicle if a substantially false statement had been made in 
the application for its registration, cannot be expanded to allow the MRA 
to assume jurisdiction. The learned Judge also referred to section 34(5) 

Crl. Misc. No.51580/M/2022 
 
- 6 - 
of the Ordinance, which states that where the suspension has continued 
without interruption for not less than six months, the MRA may cancel 
the registration and the entry relating to the vehicle in its record. His 
Lordship held that the power of cancellation of registration is limited to 
the instances mentioned in section 35 of the Ordinance, namely: (a) the 
motor vehicle has been destroyed; (b) the motor vehicle has been 
rendered permanently incapable of use; or (c) the MRA is satisfied that 
the motor vehicle has been permanently removed from the province. The 
MRA cannot decide disputes relating to the title of vehicles in the garb 
of section 34(5). 
13. 
 
Let’s now turn to the case at hand. Originally, Syed Mazhar 
Hussain Naqvi purchased the Car from Indus Motor Company Limited. 
He sold it to Muhammad Ahmad, who applied to Faysal Bank Limited 
(the “Bank”) for an “Auto Loan” and, under that arrangement, got it 
registered in its name on 2.9.2006. Muhammad Ahmad paid off his loan 
after five years, whereupon the Bank issued a No Objection Certificate 
dated 18.7.2011 asking the MRA to delete its name from the record. It 
also certified that it had no objection regarding its further sale/change of 
ownership. On 7.8.2019, Muhammad Ahmad got the Car transferred in 
his own name, and on 9.11.2019, it was registered in the Petitioner’s 
name. Admittedly, all these documents are with the Petitioner and the 
MRA’s record reflects that the Car belongs to him. 
14. 
 
On 21.6.2022, Muhammad Ahmad filed an application 
before the MRA stating that in 2010 he sold the Car to Respondent No.4 
for Rs.950,000/- and still had its possession. He claimed that the 
Petitioner had fraudulently got his name entered in the MRA’s record 
and was wrongfully asserting title to the Car. Muhammad Ahmad further 
stated that he did not execute any papers in his favour, and those he 
submitted to the MRA were forged and did not bear his signature or 
thumb impression. The MRA issued notice to the Petitioner and 
Respondent No.4 and heard them. Subsequently, with the consent of the 
Petitioner and Muhammad Ahmad, the officer concerned referred T.O. 
Form No. 0000127971 (the Transfer Form on which the Car was 
transferred to the Petitioner) to the Fingerprint Bureau Punjab for an 
opinion. The Bureau confirmed that Muhammad Ahmad had signed the 

Crl. Misc. No.51580/M/2022 
 
- 7 - 
above-mentioned T.O. Form. Accordingly, the MRA dismissed his 
application vide order dated 23.6.2022. 
15. 
 
As adumbrated, there is no provision in the Ordinance 
empowering the MRA to decide any application challenging the 
ownership of a motor vehicle or requesting it to conduct an inquiry and 
suspend or cancel the registration owing to any dispute. Hence, 
Muhammad Ahmad’s application before the MRA was not maintainable 
and the proceedings conducted on it were void. Consequently, I must not 
consider the Fingerprint Bureau’s report for deciding this petition. 
16. 
 
At this stage, at the cost of digression, I may allude to 
Articles 59, 61, 78, and 100 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984. According to 
Article 59, when the court has to form an opinion on the point of foreign 
law, science, or art, or the identity of handwriting or finger impression, 
or the authenticity of an electronic document, the opinions of the experts 
in those fields are relevant facts. Article 61 deals with the situation when 
the court has to form an opinion about the person who wrote or signed a 
document. It states that the opinion of any person acquainted with the 
handwriting of the person by whom it is supposed to be written or signed 
that it was or was not written or signed by that person is a relevant fact. 
Article 78 deals with the proof of a person’s signature and handwriting. 
It stipulates that if a question arises whether a document was signed or 
written by a particular person, his signature or handwriting, as the case 
may be, on that document must be proved. Article 100 attaches some 
presumptions to thirty years old documents. 
17. 
 
Article 164 of Qanun-e-Shahadat provides that courts may 
allow any evidence that may have become available because of 
modern devices and techniques. Proviso to Article 164, added in the 
year 2017, provides that conviction based on modern devices and 
techniques may be lawful. Article 164, read with Article 59, inter alia, 
allows modern forensic science to enter courts through the experts’ 
credible and valued scientific opinions as evidence to arrive at the 
truth. 
18. 
 
Qanun-e-Shahadat makes the expert opinion admissible, but 
section 510 Cr.P.C. states special rules of evidence and simplifies the 

Crl. Misc. No.51580/M/2022 
 
- 8 - 
evidentiary procedure by providing that the reports of the chemical 
examiner, serologist, fingerprint expert, or firearm expert may be used in 
any trial without calling the Government Chemical Examiner, 
Serologist, or the other expert as a witness. The superior courts have 
considered section 510 Cr.P.C. in several cases. In Sardar Ali v. Judge 
Special Court, Multan, and another (1996 MLD 460), the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court held: 
“No doubt any report of the Chemical Examiner or Assistant 
Chemical Examiner to Government or of the Chief Chemist of the 
Pakistan Security Printing Corporation Ltd. or any Serologist, 
fingerprint expert or firearm expert appointed by Government upon 
any matter or thing duly submitted to him for examination or analysis, 
can be used as evidence in any inquiry, trial or other proceedings 
under Cr.P.C. Such opinion is one of the species of evidence, and the 
court had been given powers to summon such person for examination. 
The proviso to section 510 Cr.P.C. makes it amply clear that any such 
opinion is of no conclusive and decisive significance and has to be 
assessed by the trial court.” 
 
19. 
 
Parliament has recently amended section 510 Cr.P.C. 
through the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2022,2 and 
made the report of the forensic scientist and the handwriting expert 
admissible per se. 
20. 
 
While interpreting section 510 Cr.P.C. (and the above-
mentioned amendment), we must, on the one hand, distinguish 
between the admissibility and the procedure for adducing the 
handwriting expert’s report in evidence and, on the other hand, its 
probative value. The law only makes the report admissible without the 
expert’s examination, but it is not conclusive evidence. The probative 
value of the report must depend upon a variety of circumstances. In 
Ali Haider alias Papu v. Jameel Hussain and others (PLD 2021 SC 
362), the Hon’ble Supreme Court held: 
“While the admissibility of expert opinion is already recognized 
under QSO [Qanun-e-Shahadat], section 510 Cr.P.C. deals with 
special rules of evidence and makes the evidentiary procedure 
simple by providing that certain reports of the chemical examiner, 
etc. may be used in any trial without calling the Government 
Chemical Examiner, serologist, fingerprint expert or firearm expert 
as a witness. Allowing admission of reports of the said 
Governmental experts in evidence without their author appearing 
as a witness has the objective of saving time and speeding up 
criminal trials. This simple procedure of admission of these reports 
in evidence is referred to as per se admissible. However, the court 
                                          
2 Published in the Gazette of Pakistan (Extraordinary) on November 18, 2022. 

Crl. Misc. No.51580/M/2022 
 
- 9 - 
may, if it considers necessary, in the interest of justice, summon 
and examine the person by whom such a report has been made ... 
As explained above, per se admissibility is a procedural facility for 
tendering evidence extended to reports of certain experts but it 
does not affect or have any bearing on the admissibility of a 
document that is governed by the QSO, and any report or opinion 
of an expert in matters of science, etc., which is recognized to be 
relevant under Articles 59 and 164 QSO and is thus admissible 
under the law of evidence (QSO) ... Needless to say that under the 
proviso to section 510 Cr.P.C the courts can always summon and 
examine the expert who has prepared and authored the report.”  
21. 
 
The jurisprudence developed over the years is that the 
handwriting expert’s opinion is relevant, but it is a weak type of 
evidence. It should not be treated as conclusive evidence to prove a fact. 
Reliance is placed upon Syed Ali Nawaz Gardezi v. Lt.-Col. 
Muhammad Yusuf (PLD 1963 SC 51); Mst. Saadat Sultan and others 
v. Muhammad Zahur Khan and others (2006 SCMR 193); Muhammad 
Ishaque Qureshi v. Sajid Ali Khan and another (2016 SCMR 192); 
Wajeeh-ul-Hassan v. The State (2019 SCMR 1994); and Muhammad 
Samiullah v. The State (2022 SCMR 998). Albeit most of these cases 
were decided before the above-mentioned amendment, the principle 
enunciated by them fully applies to the reports of the forensic scientist 
and the handwriting expert under the current framework. 
22. 
 
The above discussion shows that the fingerprint expert’s 
opinion is inconclusive. Further, section 510 Cr.P.C. does not apply to 
the proceedings before the MRA, which is constituted under the 
Ordinance, a special law. These are additional reasons why I would not 
consider the Fingerprint Bureau’s report while deciding this petition. 
23. 
 
Respondent No.4 claims that he bought the Car from 
Muhammad Ahmad through an open Transfer Deed – which inter alia 
implies an undated document. When this Transfer Deed and Muhammad 
Ahmad’s affidavit dated 7.6.2022 are examined together, it is found that 
the alleged transaction took place on 9.8.2010. According to the 
available documentation, Muhammad Ahmad did not have the right to 
sell the Car on that date because it was still in the Bank’s name. 
24. 
 
The matter does not end here. The Transfer Deed is not in 
the form prescribed under Rule 47(1) of the Punjab Motor Vehicles 
Rules, 1969. Further, an open Transfer Deed is not a valid title document 

Crl. Misc. No.51580/M/2022 
 
- 10 -
and does not transfer vehicle’s ownership under the Ordinance. In any 
case, if the transferee does not submit an application to the MRA for a 
change of ownership of a vehicle within 30 days following the 
transaction, it is null and void under section 32 of the Ordinance. 
25. 
 
The Petitioner is the registered owner of the Car and, for 
Superdari, the balance tilts in his favour. Hence, I accept this petition 
and set aside the impugned orders. The Area Magistrate is directed to 
deliver the Car to the Petitioner subject to his submission of a surety 
bond in the sum of Rs.10,00,000/- with one surety in the like amount. 
26. 
 
This order shall not preclude Respondent No.4 from 
availing remedies under civil law.
