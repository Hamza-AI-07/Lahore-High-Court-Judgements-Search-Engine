       Anwaar Hussain, J.  Contest between the parties pertains to 
bungalow No.8-A, measuring 08 kanals, situated in Civil Lines, 
Jauharabad (“the disputed property”) that was originally owned by one 
Abdul Hameed Khan (“the donor”), who happened to be the father of 
petitioners No.1 and 2 and husband of deceased petitioner No.3, namely, 
Mst. Shahzada Begum as also father of deceased Malik Muhammad 
Feroze (predecessor-in-interest of respondents No.4(i) to 4(vi), who are 
hereinafter referred to as “the contesting respondents”).  
FACTUAL BACKGROUND: 
2. 
Predecessor of the contesting respondents claimed ownership of 
the disputed property, on the basis of an oral gift in his favour that was 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.46285/2017 
 
 
2
rinsed through arbitration proceedings, between the donor and the donee, 
resulting into passing of an award that was subsequenlty made Rule of 
the Court and decree dated 13.02.1995 was passed, which the petitioners 
alleged to have been manoeuvred and is result of fraud and forgery and 
mere eye wash, just to deprive the petitioners from their lawful right of 
inheritance in the disputed property.  
3. 
It is the case of the contesting respondents that their deceased 
predecessor was given the disputed property by way of an oral gift, 
however, there was a dispute between the donor and the donee as to who 
had to pay the expenses to be incurred for the registration of the gift deed 
and to settle the same, one Mehmood Iqbal (“respondent No.3”) was 
appointed as an arbitrator, vide arbitration agreement dated 17.01.1995. 
Respondent No.3 rendered award of the even date by observing that 
during the arbitration proceedings, the donee has undertaken to pay the 
requisite fee for execution of the conveyance deed for translating the oral 
gift into a registered document and, in order to make the said award Rule 
of the Court, an application under Section 14 of the Arbitration Act, 1940  
(“the Act”) was filed by the donee, which was accepted and the award 
was made Rule of the Court followed by the decree dated 13.02.1995 
and the disputed property was transferred in favour of the donee. The 
contesting respondents claimed that the entire transaction was 
transparent and made with consent of the donor whereas petitioners 
No.1 and 2 in particular claim that when they were denied access to the 
disputed property on the pretext that it is predecessor of the contesting 
respondents, who is the owner of the disputed property, it transpired 
that fraud has been committed with them by their step brother and, 
hence, an application under Section 12(2) of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908 (“the CPC”) was filed to set aside the decree dated 
13.02.1995 passed, while making  the award Rule of the Court, 
however, the said application was dismissed by the Trial Court, vide

order dated 26.01.2012 that was upheld by the Revisional Court below, 
through order dated 13.05.2017. Hence, the present constitutional 
petition.  
ARGUMENTS: 
4. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners submit that petitioners No.1 
and 2 are real daughters of the donor who, along with their deceased 
mother/petitioner No.3, had been deprived by their step brother/son, of 
their lawful right of inheritance in the disputed property belonging to 
their father/husband, on the basis of a manipulated and sham arbitration 
proceedings and the award dated 17.01.1995 procured thereupon and the 
contentions that the donor transferred the disputed property to 
predecessor of the contesting respondents through an oral gift are false 
assertions that have not been substantiated inasmuch as the necessary 
ingredients of the impugned oral gift were never proved in the 
proceedings before any competent forum, in accordance with law. 
Reliance has been placed on the law laid down in case reported as Mian 
Ghayasuddin and others v. Mst. Hidayatun Nisa and others (2011 
SCMR 803) in support of their contentions. Add that the learned Courts 
below erred in holding that the claim of the petitioners was time barred as 
petitioners No.1 & 2, being the daughters of the donor, were extended 
warm welcome in the disputed property even after the death of the latter, 
however, when deceased Malik Muhammad Feroze denied the access, of 
the disputed property, to the petitioners on the strength of the decree 
dated 13.02.1995 passed in his favour, an application under Section 
12(2), CPC was immediately filed alleging fraud committed with them. 
Further contend that the application of the petitioners under Section 12(2) 
of the CPC, has been wrongly dismissed by the learned Courts below 
inasmuch as record clearly depicts that the application for making the 
award Rule of the Court was filed on behalf of predecessor of the 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.46285/2017 
 
 
4
contesting respondents by one Abdul Raheem, Advocate, whereas on 
behalf of the donor, one Abdul Rasheed, Advocate, appeared and 
submitted conceding written reply and the fraud, at play, becomes too 
obvious to be ignored by the mere fact that both these counsel belong to 
the same law chamber.  
5. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the contesting respondents submit 
that the application, under Section 12(2), CPC, was not maintainable 
inasmuch as if an award was to be set aside, the legal remedy available is 
envisaged under Section 30 of the Act. Adds that even otherwise, the 
application was time barred, having been filed after a lapse of about nine 
(09) years of the passing of a decree, based on the award, which was not 
maintainable and lack of knowledge of the oral gift and/or the decree 
cannot be pleaded as petitioners No.1 & 2 are not strangers rather, they 
are the step sisters of the donee and were well aware of the making and 
registration of the impugned gift. Learned counsel also asserts that there 
is no question of depriving the petitioners from the inheritance of the 
donor inasmuch as the only witness who came forward in support of the 
claim of the petitioners is husband of petitioner No.2, who admitted that 
the donor during his lifetime transferred his other property(ies) by way of 
gift to petitioners No.1 & 2  as well. Further submits that the evidence, 
available on record, cannot be read in piecemeal, rather the conjunctive 
reading of the testimony of Abdul Rasheed, Advocate (RW-1) reveals 
that he was duly engaged by the donor and on instructions of the latter, 
the conceding reply, to the application under Section 14 of the Act,  was 
submitted. Further avers that the application of the petitioners under 
Section 12(2), CPC was also not maintainable as the mandate of Order 
VI, Rule 4, CPC was not met and the particulars of fraud were not 
mentioned therein. Concludes that actual transaction of the oral gift was 
not required to be proved by the contesting respondents as the donor 
himself admitted the same while referring the matter to the arbitration 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.46285/2017 
 
 
5
and since the disputed property has been further transferred by 
predecessor of the contesting respondents, therefore, the matter has 
become a past and closed transaction.  
6. 
In rebuttal, learned counsel for the petitioners submit that there is 
no bar on filing of an application under Section 12(2), CPC to lay 
challenge to a decree based on an award, made Rule of the Court, and the 
petitioners were not bound to have recourse to Section 30 read with other 
provisions of the Act. Reliance has been placed on case reported as 
Muhammad Yasin v. Sh. Hanif Ahmed and 4 others (1993 SCMR 437) in 
support of their contention. Further contend that the distribution of the 
other properties of donor by him, between petitioners No.1 & 2 and 
predecessor of the constesting respondents, was equitable to the extent of 
the agricultural land owned by the donor, however, the disputed property 
is a residential house, which the donor occupied till his last breath and 
after his demise, it was to be divided as per lawful share of all his legal 
heirs, including the petitioners.  
7. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
POINTS OF DETERMINATION: 
8. 
Following legal and factual questions are to be adjudicated by this 
Court:  
i. 
Whether a decree based on an award, rendered under 
the Act, cannot be challenged by way of filing 
application under Section 12(2), CPC and only remedy 
available to an aggrieved person is to have recourse to 
filing of an application, under Section 30 of the Act?  
 
ii. 
Whether an oral gift of immovable property is not 
required to be proved on account of the fact that an 
arbitration between the donor and the donee took place 
subsequent to the purported gift and an award was 
passed in favour of the donee, more particularly, when 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.46285/2017 
 
 
6
the same results into depriving the female legal heirs 
of the donor, from their rights in inheritance of the 
disputed property of the donor forming subject matter 
of the award? 
ANALYSIS AND OPINION OF THE COURT 
9. 
The answer to the first question requires analysis of the interplay 
of Section 12(2), CPC and the provisions of the Act including Section 30 
thereof. The applicability of CPC, on the arbitration proceedings, under 
the Act came under discussion before the Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
case reported as Combined Enterprises v. Water and Power Development 
Authorirty (PLD 1988 SC 39), more particularly, in relation to the 
setting aside of the award and after analysing Sections 31, 32, 33 and 41 
of the Act, at page 52 of the judgment, it was observed as under:  
“Therefore, the reference and the award could only be 
interfered with in the manner laid down by sections 31, 32 
and 33 and to that extent the provisions of the Code of Civil 
Procedure are expressly excluded and no Court other than 
that mentioned therein could deal with the matter."  
It was further observed by the Supreme Court that CPC is applicable only 
subject to the provision of Section 23(2) read with Section 32 of the Act.  
The matter also came under examination in case reported as Government 
of Sindh and another v. Ch. Fazal Muhammad and another (PLD 1991 
SC 197) in which the aggrieved person therein had the opportunity to 
take all the objections to the award, which they had filed earlier and were 
rejected and therefore, they were not allowed to press the same 
objections under Section 12(2), CPC to challenge the validity of 
judgment and decree passed on the basis of the award impugned therein. 
It is imperative to observe that in both Combined Enterprises supra as 
well as Government of Sindh supra, the question whether an award made 
Rule of the Court on the basis of which a decree has been passed can be 
challenged by an application under Section 12(2), CPC, was not under 
discussion.  

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.46285/2017 
 
 
7
10. 
Moreover, the provisions of CPC in terms of Section 41 of the Act, 
are applicable to the arbitration proceedings to the extent that the same are 
not specifically excluded by the Act. Therefore, this Court is of the 
opinion that if an award is obtained by collusion of the parties and/or the 
arbitrator appointed by them, the decree based upon such an award, having 
been made Rule of the Court, more particularly defeating the rights of 
third parties, could be impeached in proceedings under Section 12(2), CPC 
instead of filing of an application under Section 30 of the Act read with 
other provisions since there is no provisoin under the Act enabling such 
third parties (like the petitioners) to lay the challenge. This Court is 
fortified by the law laid down by the Supreme Court in case of 
Muhammad Yasin supra, which appears to be the leading judgment on this 
point wherein it has been held that Sections 30 and 33 of the Act refer to 
only the awards and not the decree passed on the basis of the award and 
there is no provision for challenging such decree(s) on the ground that it 
has been obtained by misrepresentation and fraud. It had been held that 
applicability of Section 12(2), CPC has not been excluded and it was 
concluded that in the facts and circumstances of the case, application 
under both the provisions i.e., Section 30 of the Act and Section 12(2), 
CPC, was maintainable. This view has been followed by this Court in 
cases reported as Abdul Basit and another v. Muhammad Ashraf Dar and 
another (2000 CLC 920) and Mian Moazzam-Ud-Din and others v. Haji 
Sadiq Jilani and others (2002 MLD 185). Similar view has been taken by 
the Sindh High Court in case reported as Ch. Fazal Muhammad v. 
Pakistan Through Secretary Ministry of Defence (2007 CLC 148). In 
another pronouncement of the Supreme Court of Pakistan reported as Mst. 
Fateh Bevi and others v. Additional District Judge, Khushab and others 
(2008 SCMR 1262), a judgment of the lower Court allowing an 
application under Section 12(2), CPC against a judgment and decree 
passed on the basis of an award was upheld by the Supreme Court.  

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.46285/2017 
 
 
8
11. 
A contra view of this Court is also reported as Sardar Muhammad 
v. Mst. Hasmat Bibi alias Hasmatee and 3 others (2004 YLR 626) where 
it was held that an award can only be challenged under Sections 30 read 
with 33 of the Act and not under Section 12(2), CPC. However, a careful 
perusal of the said case, with respect, reveals that the judgment errs in 
law inasmuch as the same relies on the case of Government of Sindh 
supra, in respect of the proposition involved, whereas the latter case does 
not relate to the same point. In case of Government of Sindh supra, the 
Supreme Court has drawn a distinction between a challenge to the award 
itself and a challenge to a decree passed pursuant to the award. In case of 
Government of Sindh supra, the challenge was to the award and the Court 
held that the award could only be challenged under Section 30 read with 
Section 33 of the Act. It does not say that an award made Rule of the 
Court and forming basis of a decree passed pursuant to the same cannot 
be challenged under Section 12(2), CPC. Therefore, this Court is of the 
opinion that any decree based on an award that is made Rule of the 
Court, under the Act, can be challenged by way of filing application 
under Section 12(2) of the CPC, if the fraud is alleged.  
12. 
Adverting to the second question formulated hereinabove, this 
Court considers incumbent upon it to keep in sight the unique factual 
matrix of the case while answering the said question. The essence of the 
petitioners’ case is that a decree was obtained in favour of the 
predecessor of the contesting respondents on the basis of an award that 
was made Rule of the Court pursuant to the arbitration proceedings, 
having the effect of preventing the petitioners from claiming their lawful 
share of inheritance in the disputed property left by their predecessor-in-
interest inasmuch as a bogus reference to arbitration was made by the 
predecessor of the contesting respondents so that a purported oral gift in 
his favour can be documented by obtaining a decree of the Court on the 
basis of the award, and then the donee deceived the Trial Court by 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.46285/2017 
 
 
9
representing that the award was outcome of the genuine arbitration 
proceedings, though in fact it was not and the entire exercise was to 
deprive the petitioners, who were step sisters of the predecessor of the 
contesting respondents, from their share of inheritance in disputed 
property.  
13. 
Before proceeding further, it will be advantageous to examine the 
impugned award, recital(s) whereof highlights the dispute and reads as

Perusal of the impugned award reveals that while the reference was 
admittedly to resolve the issue as to who was obligated to incur the 
necessary expenses for effecting registration of oral gift, the arbitrator 
 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.46285/2017

(respondent No.3) held as under:

(Emphasis provided)
 
It is prima facie evident that even if arbitration proceedings are accepted 
to be genuine, respondent No.3 rendered the award beyond the scope of 
reference as dispute was statedly not regarding ownership of the disputed 
property. In fact, the matter became infructuous as the award istself 
envisages that the donee ended the dispute by agreeing that he will bear 
the expenses for registration of the oral gift but respondent No.3 opted to 
proceed and declare predecessor of the contesting respondents to be the 
owner of the disputed property.   
14. 
The contents of the impugned award when put in juxta position 
with the factual background of the matter, analyzed hereinabove, propels 
this Court to conclude that entire stance of predecessor of the contesting 
respondents belies logic inasmuch as if the donor, being the real father 
had divested himself from the disputed property, in favour of his son, by 
way of an oral gift, would only refuse to incur the meagre expense to 
give effect to the said gift and then readily agrees to refer the matter to 
the arbitration, in span of one day, and during the arbitration proceedings, 
the donee (predecessor of the contesting respondents) concedes to pay 
the expesnes whereafter instead of just getting straightaway registration 
of the gift deed in his favour, the donee again resorted to the legal 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.46285/2017 
 
 
11
proceedings, against the donor (his father), by filing an application under 
Section 14 of the Act, for making the said award as Rule of the Court and 
the donor again readily filed a conceding written reply, through a 
counsel, without even appearing before the Court, in person.  
15. 
The entire chain of events, as also the award itself, are prima facie 
against the normal human conduct that a father would gift his valuable 
immovable property to his son to the exclusion of his other children but 
entangle himself in litigation to the extent as to who would incur the 
meagre expenses for registration of the gift. Seems fictional, to say the 
least that the unfathomable love of father/donor for his son/donee would 
whittle away and subside when it comes to bearing expenses of 
registration of the oral gift. Prima facie, it appears that through 
manoeuvring, 
undue 
influence, 
concealment 
of 
facts 
and 
misrepresentation, an invalid award, emanating from sham arbitration 
proceedings, was made Rule of the Court followed by the impugned 
decree drawn thereof. The order making the award Rule of the Court, 
being a result of fraud and otherwise without lawful authority, was liable 
to be annulled on this ground.  
16. 
Moreover, the fact that the agreement to refer the matter to the 
arbitrator and the award passed thereon, all were made on the same day, 
in itself, is sufficient to show the fraud and misrepresentation on part of 
predecessor of the contesting respondents who was the original 
beneficiary of the oral gift of the disputed property that deprived the 
other female legal heirs of the donor (i.e., the petitioners). Moreso when 
the donor himself never appeared before the Court to give his assent to 
make the award Rule of the Court. It again seems not normal that the gift 
would be orally made but there would be a formal arbitration agreement 
in writing followed by the arbitration proceedings for resolving as to who 
has to bear the registration expenses, which reflects ingenuity at its best. 
Furthermore, scanning of the evidentiary resume of the case reveals that 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.46285/2017 
 
 
12
the lawyers, who appeared on behalf of the beneficiary of the oral gift 
(predecessor of the contesting respondents), as also on behalf of the 
donor belong to the same chamber and the counsel appearing for the 
donor acknowledged that the donor was not personally known to him. 
The statement of RW-1, who represented the donor and submitted 
conceding written reply on behalf of the donor, stated as under:

It is also pertinent to observe that the conceding written reply submitted 
on behalf of the donor also contains the name and signature of 
respondent No.3 (the arbitrator), without any plausible justification or 
legal requirement. These facts raise serious doubts as to the veracity of 
the entire arbitration proceedings culminating into passing of decree, 
based on the award rendered thereupon.

17. 
Instead of appreciating the above referred discrepencies, 
irregularities and illegalities in relation to the arbitration proceedings as 
well as the award, the learned Courts below, in general and the 
Revisional Court in particular, have proceeded to dismiss the application 
of the petitioner on the basis of comparison of disputed signatures of the 
donor with his admitted signatures, in terms of Article 84 of Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984 (“the QSO”) and the fact that only husband of 
petitioner No.2 appeared as witness who could not substantiate lack of 
knowledge of the petitioners regarding the making of the impugned oral 
gift and subsequent proceedings as also failure of the petitioners to prove 
any disability of the donor to make the gift, with his free consent, on 
account of advanced age or any illness.  
18. 
As regards comparison of the signatures of the donor by the Court, 
certainly, there is no legal bar to prevent the Court from comparing 
signatures or handwriting itself, rather, Article 84 of the QSO empowers 
the Courts to carry out such exercise, however, the naked-eye 
comparison without the aid of an expert in this regard, involves fallibility 
and may not be the conclusive proof thereof, hence, any conclusion 
drawn thereof is susceptile to error and has been given undue weightage 
in the present case. 
19. 
As far as absence of evidence on part of the petitioners’ side to 
establish lack of knowledge of the oral gift for the purposes of limitation 
for filing application under Section 12(2), CPC is concerned, suffice to 
observe that admittedly, petitioners No.1 & 2 were married step sisters of 
predecessor of the contesting respondents and residing in their marital 
abode. Therefore, possibility cannot be ruled out that they were 
prevented from the knowledge of making of the impugned oral gift and 
subsequent proceedings, hence, their stance that they came to know about 
the making of the oral gift only when they were denied access to the 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.46285/2017 
 
 
14
disputed property has force that has been erroneously ignored by the 
Courts below. Moreover, this is fair justification and has not been refuted 
by contesting respondents by leading any contra evidence. Therefore, the 
application of the petitioners was not barred by time.  
20. 
Similarly, the advanced age of the donor is not denied. Admittedly, 
the donor died, approximately, within one year after making of the 
impugned gift at the age of 90 years. Therefore, once the challenge was 
laid to the decree based on the award, made Rule of the Court, through 
application under Section 12(2) of the CPC, predecessor of the contesting 
respondents, being benenficiary of the oral gift, was obligated to prove 
the said transaction as the oral gift was extremely suspectful as examined 
hereinabove, having purportedly been made by the donor, on whose 
mental and physical health, serious questions had been raised on account 
of advanced age. In this regard, Section 16 of the Contract Act, 1872 
(“the Act 1872”) becomes relevant and its sub-section (3) throws burden 
of proof on the beneficiary that a contract (oral gift in the instant case) 
was not induced by the undue influence when two factors are found 
against him. Firstly, if the beneficiary is in a position to dominate the will 
of another (the donor in instant case) and secondly, if the transaction 
appears, on the face of it, to be unconscionable. Section 16 of the Act 
1872 reads as under:  
“16. "Undue influence" defined. (1) A contract is said to be 
induced by "undue influence" where the relations subsisting 
between the parties are such that one of the parties is in a 
position to dominate the will of the other and uses that 
position to obtain an unfair advantage over the other. 
(2) In particular and without prejudice to the generality of 
the foregoing principle, a person is deemed to be in a 
position to dominate the will of another- 
(a) where he holds a real or apparent authority over the other 
or where he stands in a fiduciary relation to the other; or 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.46285/2017 
 
 
15
(b) where he makes a contract with a person whose mental 
capacity is temporarily or permanently affected by reason of 
age, illness, or mental or bodily distress. 
(3) Where a person who is in a position to dominate the will 
of another, enters into a contract with him, and the 
transaction appears, on the face of it or on the evidence 
adduced, to be unconscionable, the burden of proving that 
such contract was not induced by undue influence shall lie 
upon the person in a position to dominate the will of the 
other. 
Nothing in this sub-section shall affect the provisions of 
section 111 of the Evidence Act, 1872.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
The impugned oral gift, by all standards was unconscionable as it is 
inexplicable as to why the donor would want to deprive his daughters 
from his inheritance in the disputed property (residential house) when, 
admittedly, he had equitably distributed his other property(ies). It is trite 
law that the beneficiaries of a gift, more importantly oral in nature, have 
to establish it by giving particulars of the gift, including when and where 
the gift was made, which predecessor of the contesting respondents have 
not provided and the said failure is fatal to the case of the contesting 
respondents. 
21. 
At this juncture, it is imperative to observe that Islamic philosophy 
aims to end injustice and oppression of the weak and vulnerable segment 
of the society by conferring equal status upon the women and ordaining 
not to abuse and exploit the vulnerables. Glorious Quran recognizes the 
right of women to inherit which has a close nexus with enjoying a 
complete legal personality by the females. The Constitution of the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 also extends protection of rights of 
the women, inter alia, through Article 25 read with Aricle 37 thereof that 
talk about equality and special protection, respectively. In case reported 
as Khair Din vs. Mst. Salaman and others (PLD 2002 SC 677), the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan held that no benefit could be derived by those 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.46285/2017 
 
 
16
claiming rights against the female legal heirs, based on fraudulent 
transactions. It has been further held that an heir is considered to be in 
constructive possession of the property on behalf of all the heirs inspite 
of his exclusive possession. Moreover, the oral gifts like one, in the 
present case, forming subject matter of an arbitration proceedings, and 
the subsequent award and decree based on it, are contracts that have been 
held to be against the public policy, by the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
and hence, not enforceable. Case reported as Farhan Aslam and others v. 
Mst. Nuzba Shaheen and another (2021 SCMR 179) is referred in this 
regard. 
22. 
The above analysis propels this Court to opine that factum of an 
arbitration proceedings having been conducted, between the donor and 
the donee, subsequent to the making of impugned oral gift and passing of 
the award in favour of the donee that was made Rule of the Court, ipso 
facto does not absolve the donee to prove the genuineness of the 
impugned oral gift, more particularly, when the same results into 
depriving the female legal heirs of the donor, from their rights in 
inheritance of the disputed property belonging to the donor. This Court is 
of the considered opinion that it does not make any difference if such 
contracts are camouflaged and given legal cover through initiation of 
arbitration proceedings and passing of the award thereafter, when it 
transpires that such arbitration proceedings initiated and the award passed 
thereof were mere eye wash and therefore, the donee was obligated to 
prove the transaction, which in the instant case, predecessor of the 
contesting respondents failed to do.  
23. 
In view of the above discussion, this Court is of the view that both 
the Courts below have erred in rendering the impugned findings. This 
constitutional petition has force and merits acceptance, and hence, 
allowed, with costs throughout, and the impugned orders are set aside. As

a natural corollary, the application of the petitioners under Section 12(2), 
CPC is accepted and the decree dated 13.02.1995 passed on the basis of 
award dated 17.01.1995, made Rule of the Court, is set aside.
