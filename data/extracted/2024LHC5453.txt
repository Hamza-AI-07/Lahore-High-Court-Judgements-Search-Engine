Through this constitution petition, the petitioner 
Reliance Weaving Mills Limited („petitioner’) seeks 
suspension of recovery notices issued by the Deputy 
Commissioner Inland Revenue, Multan/Respondent 
No.2 („DCIR’) raising demand for recovery of Sales 
Tax during the pendency of Sales Tax Reference (STR 
No.93/2024) filed before this Court by the petitioner 
under Section 47 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990. The 
following prayer has been made:- 
“It is therefore respectfully that the instant writ 
petition may graciously be accepted and the notice dated 
20-08-2024 alongwith other notices dated 13-11-2024 
issued by the respondent No.2 may kindly be set aside/ 
cancelled till the final decision of STR (Sales Tax 
Reference) pending before this Hon'ble Court, in the 
supreme interest of justice. 
It is further prayed that till the decision of main STR 
the operation and proceedings on the impugned notices 
may also be stayed/suspended. 
Any other relief, which this August Court may 
deems fit in the interest of justice may also be granted to 
the petitioner.” 
 
2. 
The petitioner is a Public Limited Company 
incorporated under the Companies Ordinance, 1984 
(Now the Companies Act, 2017). The company is 

W.P. No.15377 of 2024 
 
-:2:-
principally 
engaged 
in 
the 
business 
of 
textile 
Manufacture, Export and Local Sales of Yarn and 
Fabric. The petitioner on 27.06.2024 filed Sales Tax 
Reference No.93/2024 before this Court to challenge the 
Order in Appeal No. 31/2023 dated 22.12.2022 passed 
by the Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals-II), 
Multan, stated to be served through registered post on 
22.05.2024, upholding the Order in Original No.02 of 
2022-23 passed on 06.07.2022 by the Assistant 
Commissioner Inland Revenue, Unit No.03, Audit-II, 
Large Tax Payers Office Multan whereby demand of 
Sales Tax for Rs.39,360,490/- was established and 
raised against the petitioner.  
3. 
It is claimed that the said Sales Tax Reference is 
still pending before this Court and respondent No.2 due 
to grudge of filing of STR, has sent notice dated 
20.08.2024 for recovery under Section 48 of the Sales 
Tax Act, 1990 to the concerned Inland Revenue and 
Customs Authorities with the direction to deduct the 
aforesaid amount from money owning to the petitioner, 
which may be under the control of respective 
authorities; and the Government dues so recovered 
should be sent to the said respondent immediately for 
payment to the government treasury. The operative 
portion is of said notice is reproduced below:- 
“No. 41 
                           Dated 20.08.2024 
 
Subject: Notice for recovery under section 48 of the Sales 
Tax Act, 1990. 
Whereas, Government dues amount to Rs.39,360,490/- as 
Sales Tax and default surcharge is recoverable from M/s 
Reliance Weaving Mills Limited, on account of Order-in-
Original No. 02/2022-23 dated 06.07.2022 bearing NTN: 
0133480.  
Now, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred by 
clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 48 of the Sales Tax 
Act, 1990, I do hereby require all Customs, Federal Excise,

owing to the said registered person, which may be 
under the control of respective authorities; and 
ii.

to the undersigned immediately.” 
4. 
The said notice was followed by other notices all 
dated 13-11-2024 addressed to various banks where 
petitioner has its accounts. The operative portion of one 
such notice is reproduced below:- 
“No. 120

5. 
The afore-referred notices have been challenged 
through this Constitution petition seeking suspension of 
recovery notices/proceedings during pendency of the 
afore-referred STR.  
6. 
The question under consideration of this Court is 
as to whether this Court while exercising its 
Constitutional jurisdiction should stay the recovery 

W.P. No.15377 of 2024 
 
-:4:-
notices issued to the petitioner during the pendency of 
Sales Tax Reference before this Court, which ought to 
be heard by a Bench comprising of not less than two 
judges of this Court i.e. at least a Division Bench of this 
Court in terms of Section 47 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990.  
7. 
It is not disputed that access to justice is a 
fundamental right and an essential feature of the said 
right is that there should be adjudication of grievance by 
an independent Tribunal before a person can be 
proceeded against under the law as laid down by the 
Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in case titled 
Mehram Ali and others v. Federation of Pakistan and 
others (PLD 1998 SC 1445) and in the case titled Jawad 
S. Khawaja and another v. Federation of Pakistan and 
others (PLD 2024 SC 337) while considering Scope and 
essential ingredients of right of fair trial in reference to 
Article 10-A of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic 
of Pakistan, 1973 “the Constitution” it has been held 
that basic ingredients for a fair trial in the light of Article 
10-A of the Constitution are that there should be an 
independent, impartial court, a fair and public hearing, 
right of counsel, right to information of the offence 
charged for with an opportunity to cross examine 
witnesses and an opportunity to produce evidence. It 
also includes the right to a reasoned judgment and 
finally the remedy of appeal. Hence, the ultimate 
objective is to ensure fairness in the process and 
proceedings and fairness itself being an evolving 
concept cannot be confined to any definition or frozen at 
any moment, with certain fundamentals which operate 
as constants. Independence of the decision maker and 
their impartiality is one such constant. A reasoned 
judgment before a judicial forum is another constant 

W.P. No.15377 of 2024 
 
-:5:-
without which the right of fair trial would become 
meaningless. Right of an independent forum of appeal is 
another relevant constant which ensures fair trial. 
8. 
It is also pertinent to mention here that the law laid 
down in a case titled Central Board of Revenue and 
others versus Chanda Motors (1993 SCMR 39) is that 
Assessment Orders as such do not have touch of finality 
unless all the forums are exhausted in which such orders 
can be challenged, so that the orders take the shape of 
final decisions. Order of Assessment passed by Income 
Tax Officer is an order of original authority but is not 
final for the reason that it can be challenged in appeal or 
revision, as the case may be, and would be final only 
when it goes through all the forums and finding of the 
last forum shall be binding as conclusive. Legal pursuit 
of a remedy, suit, appeal and second appeal are really 
but steps in a series of proceedings all connected by an 
intrinsic unity and are to be regarded as one legal 
proceeding. When an appeal is filed against an 
Assessment Order before the Appellate Authority, the 
assessment is thrown open and the appellate proceedings 
constitute a continuation of the assessment proceedings. 
The legislature when it provides a hierarchy of tribunals 
for the determination of a dispute is really providing one 
complete procedure for such determination, proceedings 
before different tribunals being only steps in this 
procedure. Order passed in original proceedings is not 
final unless it crosses all the forums set up under that 
law in which it can be challenged and the order of the 
last forum would become final.   
9. 
This Court and other High Courts in numerous 
judgments relating to recovery of tax, where either stay 
was not granted or had expired due to efflux of 

W.P. No.15377 of 2024 
 
-:6:-
maximum time provided by the statute for which time a 
forum can grant interim relief, have held that an assessee 
is entitled to adjudication in respect of his disputed tax 
liabilities by at least one independent forum outside 
hierarchy of the respondent department and the appellate 
tribunal in taxation matters is the first independent 
forum in terms of principles laid down in judgments 
reported as Caltex Oil (Pakistan) Ltd. versus Collector, 
Central Excise and Sales Tax and others (2005 PTD 
480 (Supreme Court) = 2006 SCMR 1519), Messrs. 
Islamabad Electric Supply Company Limited v. 
Additional Commissioner Inland Revenue and other 
(2024 PTD 30 Islamabad), Pakistan Oil Fields Ltd. 
through Authorised Attorney and General Manager v. 
Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Revenue and 
2 others (2016 PTD 1590 Islamabad) = PLD 2016 
Islamabad 76), Messrs. Magna Processing Industries 
(Pvt.) Ltd., Faisalabad through Chief Executive v. 
Federation of Pakistan through Secretary and others 
(2014 PTD 841), Messrs. Niagara Mills (Pvt.) Ltd. 
through Chief Executive v. Federation of Pakistan 
through Secretary Revenue, and others (2014 CLD 
1253), Messrs Dawood Textile Printing Industries (Pvt.) 
Ltd., Faisalabad through Chief Executive v. Federation 
of Pakistan through Secretary, Revenue Division, F.B.R. 
and others” (2009 PTD 1220). 
10. The High Court while directing the said forums i.e. 
the Appellate Tribunal and appellate forums in the 
department to adjudicate the matter within specified 
time frame have passed orders staying the recovery of 
tax by the department/departmental authorities during 
the pendency of appeal before the said forums. 
Reference may be made to the judgment by a Full Bench 

W.P. No.15377 of 2024 
 
-:7:-
of the Sindh High Court titled Messrs. Pak Saudi 
Fertilizers Ltd. v. Federation of Pakistan and others 
reported as (2002 PTD 679) where in proceedings for 
recovery of tax were stayed by the High Court while 
directing the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal to 
adjudicate the matter. Similarly, in cases titled Messrs 
Islamabad Electric Supply Company Limited v. 
Additional Commissioner Inland Revenue and other” 
(2024 PTD 30) and Messrs Pakistan Housing 
Foundation v. The Commissioner Inland Revenue 
Appeal and others (2022 PTD 1263), the Islamabad 
High Court stayed proceedings for recovery tax while 
directing the Additional Commissioner Inland Revenue 
and Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) to decide 
the matter pending before them, respectively. This Court 
in cases titled Messrs Kamal Ltd. through Director v. 
Federation of Pakistan through Chairman and 2 others 
(2017 PTD 243), Messrs Magna Processing Industries 
(Pvt.) Ltd., Faisalabad through Chief Executive v. 
Federation of Pakistan through Secretary and others 
(2014 PTD 841), Messrs Niagara Mills (Pvt.) Ltd. 
through Chief Executive v. Federation of Pakistan 
through Secretary Revenue, and others (2014 CLD 
1253), Messrs Dawood Textile Printing Industries (Pvt.) 
Ltd., Faisalabad through Chief Executive v. Federation 
of Pakistan through Secretary, Revenue Division, F.B.R. 
and others (2009 PTD 1220), Sun-Rise Bottling 
Company (Pvt.) Ltd. through Chief Executive v. 
Federation of Pakistan and 4 others (2006 PTD 535), 
Brothers Engineering (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Appellate Tribunal 
Sales Tax (2003 PTD 1836) and Z.N. Exports (Pvt.) Ltd. 
v. Collector of Sales Tax (2003 PTD 1746), directed the 
Appellate Tribunal to decide the appeal filed by the 
assessee and stayed recovery proceeding in the mean 

W.P. No.15377 of 2024 
 
-:8:-
while and in cases reported as Agri Force Chemicals v. 
Federation of Pakistan and others (2016 PTD 1070), 
Messrs. Aidy Vee & Co. (Pvt.) Ltd. through Director v. 
Taxation Office of Income Tax, Lahore and 4 others 
(2009 PTD 1715) and Messrs Ibrahim Fibers Limited 
through Secretary v. Commissioner of Income Tax 
(Audit), Large Taxpayer Unit, Lahore and 3 others 
(2009 PTD 2006), directed the Commissioner Inland 
Revenue (Appeals) and Commissioner Income Tax 
(Appeals) to decide the appeal and in the meanwhile 
granted stay against recovery. However, in none of the 
above mentioned cases, stay order against recovery of 
demand of tax was issued by this Court in its 
constitutional jurisdiction, when the Tax Reference had 
already been filed before this Court; hence, the 
aforementioned judgments are distinguishable on the 
basis of facts of the case especially when the 
adjudication by an independent forum i.e. the Appellate 
Tribunal, has already taken place. 
11. After an appeal is decided by the Appellate 
Tribunal, the aggrieved party has a right to approach this 
Court by filing a reference application to challenge the 
order passed by the Appellate Tribunal, for which, 
limitation of 90 days has been provided in the law. 
Where a right to approach this Court through any 
remedy provided by law such as appeal, revision, review 
or reference is available to the party, this Court 
ordinarily does not entertain the constitution petition 
against the said order due to availability of the said 
alternate remedy especially when it is also equally 
efficacious, which is subject to the exception/power of 
this Court that this Court can always convert one type of 
proceeding into another type of proceeding and decide it 

W.P. No.15377 of 2024 
 
-:9:-
itself, subject to the rider that it has jurisdiction over the 
issue, subject matter of the dispute and if jurisdiction is 
not vested in this Court to decide then to refer the same 
to the competent authority, forum, officer or court for its 
decision on merits. Reliance may be placed on Hafsa 
Habib Qureshi and others versus Amir Hamza and 
others (PLD 2024 Supreme Court 780), where it is laid 
down as under:- 
“9.    Besides, the High Court has the power to convert and 
treat one type of proceeding into another type. After doing 
so, it can proceed to decide the matter itself, provided it 
has jurisdiction over the issue, or it may remit the matter to 
the competent authority, forum, or court for a decision on 
its merits. Reference in this regard may be made to the 
cases of Muhammad Akram v. DCO, Rahim Yar Khan and 
others (2017 SCMR 56); Sher Alam Khan v. Abdul Munim 
and others (PLD 2018 Supreme Court 449); and the 
Commissioner of Income Tax (Legal) RTO, Abbottabad v. 
Messrs Ed-Zublin AG Germany and another (2020 SCMR 
500).” 
12. Reliance in this behalf may also be placed on 
Muhammad Salman versus Naveed Anjum and others 
(2021 SCMR 1675) wherein it is provided as under:- 
“The power to convert and or treat one kind of proceeding 
into another is derived from the doctrine of "ex debito 
justitiae", wherein, the Court owes a debt to the litigant to 
correct an error in judicial dispensation. This authority is 
inherently possessed and exercised by the Court not only to 
advance the cause of justice but also to prevent the 
injustice. The Superior Courts cannot be barred or 
restrained to convert one type of proceeding into another 
and either proceed to decide the matter itself, provided the 
court itself having jurisdiction over the lis, or may remit the 
lis to the court/forum of competent jurisdiction for decision 
on its own merits. The Superior Courts have been treating 
and/or converting appeal into revisions and vice versa and 
Constitution Petitions into appeal or revisions.”  
 
13. Needless to mention that despite the power vested 
in this Court to convert this Constitution petition into a 
reference application/petition, it is not a plausible/ 
feasible option in the present case for the reason that a 
reference application has already been filed by the 

W.P. No.15377 of 2024 
 
-:10:-
petitioner prior to the filing of this constitution petition 
and the Division Bench of this Court, that has to hear the 
said reference application, enjoys full powers to grant 
relief prayed for by the petitioner.  
14. Without prejudice to what has been discussed 
above, a situation may arise that recovery proceedings 
are commenced against an assessee before the reference 
is filed and limitation period for filing reference has still 
not expired, which necessitates the filing of the 
constitution petition for redress of grievance for the 
reason that reference application cannot be immediately 
filed by the assessee due to circumstances beyond his 
control, such as, the non-receipt of order of the 
Appellate Tribunal, which is necessarily to be attached 
with the reference application, then this Court may in 
appropriate cases exercise its constitutional jurisdiction 
to restrain the respondent from taking coercive measures 
for recovery of the demand raised by the tax authorities 
and stay the same during the pendency of the limitation 
period in order to enable the assesse to have resort to 
remedy available to him under the law i.e. by filing 
reference before this Court. However, this is not the 
situation in the present case as no plausible reason or 
disability has been cited to justify filing of this petition 
to seek relief as an interim measure. 
15. In the present case, STR has already been filed on 
27.06.2024, yet it is claimed that the same has not yet 
been fixed for hearing as the same was filed as a motion 
case without attaching an urgent form. However, 
pendency of the same in motion does not deprive the 
petitioner of the right to file an application for early 
hearing of the same or an application to seek stay 

W.P. No.15377 of 2024 
 
-:11:-
accompanied by an urgent form. The said application, if 
filed, is to be fixed before a Division Bench of this 
Court, for appropriate orders, which would not require 
more time than required to file a separate constitution 
petition for the same purpose. However, no attempt has 
yet been made by the petitioner to get the said matter 
fixed for hearing by a Division Bench of this Court and 
the instant Constitution petition has been filed to seek 
the same relief.  
16. In this scenario, the question arises whether this 
Court should exercise its constitutional jurisdiction to 
entertain the said grievance or request, it is settled by 
now that there is no legal impediment in the way of 
court or tribunal to decide question of its own 
jurisdiction to entertain and decide a matter. Reliance is 
placed on Muhammad Salman v. Naveed Anjum and 
others (2021 SCMR 1675), Government of Punjab v. 
Sanosh Sultan (PLD 1995 SC 541) and Raunaq Ali v. 
Chief Settlement Commissioner (PLD 1973 SC 236). 
Although this Court may in appropriate cases exercise 
its constitutional jurisdiction despite availability of 
alternate remedy, yet that jurisdiction is to be exercised 
by keeping in view the question whether equally 
efficacious remedy is available to the petitioner or not. 
In this case, it is apparent from the above mentioned 
narration of facts that equally efficacious alternate 
remedy is available to the petitioner which right has also 
been exercised by the petitioner by filing a reference 
application before this Court, which is still pending and 
consequently it would not be appropriate for this Court 
to exercise constitutional jurisdiction at this stage for the 
reason that where a thing is required to be done in a 
particular manner then it should be done in that manner 

W.P. No.15377 of 2024 
 
-:12:-
as required by the statute otherwise such act will be 
illegal and without jurisdiction. Reliance is placed on 
Commissioner Inland Revenue, Large Taxpayers Office, 
Islamabad v. Pakistan Oilfields Ltd., Rawalpindi and 
others (2024 PTD 1085 (SC) = 2024 SCMR 853).  
17. Petitioner has not made any attempt to get his 
reference application and the stay application fixed for 
hearing before approaching this Court for redress of 
grievance through the instant constitution petition. 
Needless to mention here that proper procedure for 
exercising of jurisdiction is dependent upon two 
principles of law that “what can be done directly should 
not be allowed to be done indirectly” and “what cannot 
be done directly cannot be done indirectly”. Reliance 
may be placed on Muhammad Hanif Abbasi v. Imran 
Khan Niazi and others (PLD 2018 SC 189) and Federal 
Board of Revenue v. Dewan Salman Fiber Ltd. and 
others (2023 SCMR 1871).   
18. Moreover, this Court in its Constitutional 
jurisdiction is not in a position to give direction to the 
learned Division Bench of this Court to entertain and 
decide the reference application already pending before 
it for the reason that the same would amount to High 
Court entertaining constitution petition against itself 
which jurisdiction has specifically been excluded by 
Article 199 of the Constitution and High Court cannot 
exercise its writ jurisdiction against itself. Reliance is 
placed on Gul Taiz Khan Marwat v. The Registrar, 
Peshawar High Court, Peshawar and others (PLD 2021 
SC 391), Chief Justice of Pakistan Iftikhar Muhammad 
Chaudhry v. President of Pakistan through Secretary 
and others (PLD 2010 SC 61), Muhammad Iqbal and 
others v. Lahore High Court through Registrar and 

W.P. No.15377 of 2024 
 
-:13:-
others (2010 SCMR 632) and Muhammad Shafi and 
another v. Attaullah and others (1984 SCMR 1124). 
19. Consequently, this petition, at this stage is not 
entertainable/maintainable due to equally efficacious 
alternate remedy available to petitioner, under the law. 
However, it is observed that the petitioner, if advised, in 
the first instance may avail the said remedy.  
20. When this order was announced, the learned 
counsel for petitioner states that he does not press this 
petition any further and wants to withdraw the same in 
order to avail alternate remedy under the law.  
21. Disposed of accordingly.
