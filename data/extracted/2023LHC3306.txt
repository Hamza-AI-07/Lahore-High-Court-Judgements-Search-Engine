Rawalpindi was acquired for the expansion and protection against any 
security hazard to Air Weapons Complex (hereinafter referred to as 
“AWC”), Village Lab Thathoo Taxila.  
2.   
Facts forming background are that on the request of the 
Director Works & Services, Directorate of Works & Services Air 
Weapons Complex Wah Cantt, Land Acquisition Collector, Taxila  
(hereinafter referred to as “L.A.C”) initiated the proceedings for 
acquisition of piece of land for expansion and protection against any 
security hazard to “AWC”, a project of vital national importance by 
issuance of notification under section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 
1894 (hereinafter referred to as “Act”), which was approved by the 
District Collector, Rawalpindi and published in the Punjab Gazette on 
4th December, 2004, declaring that the land measuring 180-Kanal 2-
Marla specified in the notification is required for the purpose of defense 
project of AWC-PAF, Wah Cantt. This followed a notification under 
section 17(4) & 6 of the “Act”, whereby provisions of sections 5 and 5-A 
of the “Act” were waived and Collector was authorized under section 7 
of the “Act” to take order for acquisition of the said land. The acquiring 
department, however, excluded 3-Kanal of land and finally 177-Kanal 
2-Marla land was notified as per notification under sections 17(4) and 6 
of the “Act” from Village Lub Thathoo, Tehsil Taxila, District 
Rawalpindi. After issuance of notices under sections 9 & 10 of the “Act” 
and observing other codal formalities, award in terms of section 11 of 
the “Act” was announced wherein compensation for the acquired land 
was determined in the following manner: -

The land owners feeling dissatisfied from the compensation, moved their 
petitions under section 18 of the “Act” before the “L.A.C”, who routed 
the same to the learned Senior Civil Judge for decision, which were 
since decided through separate orders, hence these appeals.

This appeal is on behalf of National Command Authority 
(NCA) and Air Weapons Complex (AWC) (hereinafter referred to as 
“beneficiary department”) under section 54 of the “Act” challenging 
the vires of order dated 6th December, 2013 passed on a reference 
petition filed by respondents No.1 to 5 (hereinafter referred as “land 
owners”), whereby the learned Senior Civil Judge accepted the 
reference petition and held the “land owners” entitled to receive the 
compensation @ Rs.3,00,000/- per Marla alongwith 15% compulsory 
acquisition charges and 8% interest compound interest under section 28 
of the “Act” from the date of award till the date of payment of 
compensation.

compensation was enhanced from Rs.70,000/- to Rs.10,00,000/- per 
Kanal alongwith 15% compulsory acquisition charges, 8% interest 
compound interest under section 28 of the “Act” on the enhanced 
compensation from the date of award till the date of payment of

Brief background of R.F.A No.155 of 2016. 
6.  
R.F.A No.155 of 2016 is also on behalf of one of the “land 
owner”, who has challenged the order dated 29th April, 2016, whereby 
on his reference petition, the learned Senior Civil Judge, Rawalpindi 
held him entitled to receive compensation @ Rs.6,00,000/- per Kanal 
alongwith 15% compulsory acquisition charges, 8% compound interest 
on the excess amount under section 28 of the “Act”. 
7.   
Learned counsel representing the “beneficiary department” 
submitted that compensation was rightly determined by the Collector in 
the award. He added that the Referee Court, without adverting to the 
material pieces of evidence, enhanced the compensation in a flimsy 
manner. Learned counsel contended that while enhancing the 
compensation, learned Senior Civil Judge has mainly relied upon an 
application form for membership of “AWC” Employees Housing Society 
(Exh.A8), which was even not admissible in evidence. Learned counsel 
submitted that in view of statement of Muhammad Yasin Abbasi/AW-1, 
the former DDO (R) and his report Exh.A1, compensation cannot be 
awarded at the rate determined by the Referee Court. It is vehemently 
contended by the learned counsel for the “beneficiary department” that 
the Referee Court proceeded in a mechanical manner without 
application of judicious mind to the facts of the case and as such 
impugned orders resulting into enhancement of compensation are not 
tenable. In support of his contentions, learned counsel placed reliance 
on FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through Secretary Ministry of 
Defence and another v. JAFFAR KHAN and others (PLD 2010 Supreme 
Court 604), ASKARI CEMENT LIMITED (FORMERLY ASSOCIATED 
CEMENT LIMITED) through Chief Executive v. LAND ACQUISITION 
COLLECTOR (INDUSTRIES) PUNJAB and others (2013 SCMR 1644) 
and MANZOOR HUSSAIN (deceased) through L.Rs. v. MISRI KHAN 
(PLD 2020 Supreme Court 749).

8.  
While responding to the contentions of learned counsel for the 
“beneficiary 
department”, 
Mr. 
Imran 
Hassan 
Ali, 
Advocate 
representing the “land owners” in R.F.A No.83 of 2014, submitted that 
the acquired land was commercial in nature and to this effect, 
overwhelming evidence is available on the record. He added that 
Muhammad Yasin Abbasi, former DDO(R) was examined for the 
production of documentary evidence in the shape of his report Exh.A1. 
Learned counsel submitted that in terms of Article 134 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984, said witness could not be cross-examined. 
Learned counsel emphasized that compensation was not enhanced by 
the Referee Court merely on the basis of Exh.A8 but whole evidence was 
taken into consideration for the said purpose. It is submitted that 
documents Exh.A2 to Exh.A8 were though tendered in the statement of 
counsel but no objection was taken at the relevant time and as such 
“beneficiary department” is precluded to take any such objection at the 
belated stage. Reliance is placed on MUHAMMAD IQBAL v. 
MEHBOOB ALAM (2015 SCMR 21), GULZAR HUSSAIN v. ABDUR 
REHMAN and another (1985 SCMR 301), PERVAIZ AKHTAR and 
others v. LAND ACQUISITION COLLECTOR and others (PLD 2022 
Lahore 730), FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN through 
Ministry of Defence Rawalpindi and others v. Mst. ZAKIA BEGUM and 
others (PLD 2023 Supreme Court 277) and Mst. AKHTAR SULTANA v. 
Major Retd. MUZAFFAR KHAN MALIK through his legal heirs and 
others (PLD 2021 Supreme Court 715).  
9.   
Mr. Tanvir Iqbal Khan, Advocate representing the “land 
owners” in RFA No.53 of 2014 submitted that the land owned by his 
clients was abutting the main Hazara Road and is of commercial nature. 
He added that though land in question was of one kind and nature but it 
was divided into two categories without any rhyme and reason. Learned 
counsel submitted that the “land owners” were deprived of from due 
compensation. It is vehemently argued by the learned counsel that while 

6 
 
 
 
                  R.F.AsNo.83,84,53/2014 & 155/2016 
 
 
 
determining the compensation, the Collector did not take into 
consideration the potential value of the acquired land. In support of his 
contentions, learned counsel placed reliance on AIR WEAPON 
COMPLEX through DG v. MUHAMMAD ASLAM and others (2018 
SCMR 779). 
10.  
Mr. Muhammad Asif Chaudhary, Advocate representing the 
“land owners” in R.F.A No.155 of 2016, while adopting the arguments 
of learned counsel for the other “land owners” submitted that though 
land of his client was situated in the same Khasra numbers where land 
of “land owners” namely M/s Amjad Kamal Malik falls but he was 
discriminated in the matter of compensation. Learned counsel contended 
that his client is also entitled for the same treatment as he cannot be 
discriminated in terms of Article 25 of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973. 
11.  
Heard. Record perused. 
12.  
As already observed that on the request of Director Works 
and Services, Directorate Works and Services, Air Weapons Complex 
Wah Cantt, land measuring 177-Kanal 2-Marla situated in village Lab 
Thathoo was acquired for the expansion and protection against any 
security hazard to “AWC”, a project of vital national importance 
through awarded dated 16th July, 2009. For the purpose of acquisition, 
notification under section 4 of the “Act” was published in the gazette on 
4th December, 2004, which followed notification under section 17 (4) & 
6 of the “Act”. The acquired land comprising of 177-Kanal 2-Marla 
formed part of Khasra Nos.1842 to 1850, 2144/1-2 and 2145. It evinces 
from the award that from Khasra Nos.1842 to 1850, an area of 136-
Kanal 5-Marla was acquired for which compensation was awarded @ 
Rs.70,000/- per Kanal. The portion of acquired land situated in Khasra 
Nos.2144/1-2 and Khasra No.2145 was, however, distributed in 
commercial and residential character and while treating 19-Kanal 11-

7 
 
 
 
                  R.F.AsNo.83,84,53/2014 & 155/2016 
 
 
 
Marla as commercial, compensation was fixed as Rs.6,00,000/- per 
Kanal whereas for rest of 21-K 6-M, which was treated as residential, 
Rs.3,50,000/- per Kanal was awarded. There are thus  three categories 
of “land owners” whose land was acquired through award. The “land 
owners” in RFA No.83 of 2014 were divested from their land measuring 
25-Kanal 13-Marla bearing Khasra No.2144/1-2 and 2145 out of which 
19-Kanal 11-Marla was treated as commercial whereas 6-Kanal 2-
Marla was treated as residential. Their claim in the reference, however, 
was that whole land was commercial in nature and as such they claimed 
compensation @ Rs.10,00,000/- per Marla. In support whereof, they 
produced Muhammad Yasin Abbasi, former DDO(R) as AW-1, in whose 
statement report dated 29th October, 1997 was tendered as Exh.A1. In 
addition, one of the “land owners” Zahoor Azam appeared as AW-2, 
who in his statement reiterated the contents of his reference petition. 
Syed Ghulam Mustafa Shah was produced as AW-3 to further strengthen 
the claim, however, copies of notification and awards alongwith copy of 
record of rights, ‘Aks Shajra Kishtwar’ and application form for 
membership was produced in the statement of counsel. It would not be 
out of place to mention here that all the “land owners” have produced 
almost similar evidence. 
13.  
In order to diminish the value of the evidence produced by the 
“land owners”, the “beneficiary department” produced Khalid Hussain, 
Assistant Air Weapon Complex (AWC) as RW-1, who also tendered 
certain documents in evidence to rebut the claim of the “land owners”.  
14.  
After having apprised the evidence, learned Senior Civil 
Judge enhanced the compensation @ Rs.3,00,000/- per Marla i.e. 
Rs.60,00,000/- per Kanal. In order to evaluate the findings of the trial 
Court, we have also reappraised the evidence produced by both the 
sides. As the acquired land was bifurcated in two categories i.e. 
commercial and residential but it is claimed by the “land owners” that 

8 
 
 
 
                  R.F.AsNo.83,84,53/2014 & 155/2016 
 
 
 
their land was of commercial in nature, so it would be apt to first 
determine this fact.  
15.  
In their reference petition, “land owners” at the very outset, 
asserted that whole land bearing Khasra Nos.2144 and 2145 is 
commercial in nature and abuts main G.T Road leading towards 
Abotabad surrounded by many other commercial properties, including 
petrol pumps/CNG Stations, etc. To this effect, in addition to oral 
account, the “land owners” also produced ‘Aks Shajra Kishtwar’ as 
Exh.A7, which is evident of the fact that their land is located at the 
periphery of the main Hazara Road. While responding these assertions, 
the “beneficiary department” did not specifically deny the facts asserted 
in the petition. In para-1 in the latter portion of their reply, an evasive 
denial to this effect was though made, which is nothing but an admission 
of fact on their part as per contemplation of Order VIII Rule 5 of the 
Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908) (hereinafter referred to as “CPC”). 
The statement of Zahoor Azam, AW-2 is also unequivocal to this effect. 
Khalid Hussain, RW-1, during cross-examination, also confirmed the 
status of the acquired land as commercial in the following words: - 
درس ت ےہ ہک ذتمرکہ ب ال رسخ

یج یٹ روڈ وج ای 
AWC
 اک رٹپول پمپ ایہن رسخہ ربمنات ںیم واعق ےہ۔ 
The above extract of the evidence of the parties leads us to an 
irresistible conclusion that acquired land was of commercial nature at 
the time of its acquisition.  
16.  
Next comes the matter relating to the compensation of 
acquired land. Since we have already noted the rate at which the 
Collector fixed the compensation and the land owners claimed it from 
the Referee Court and the amount for which they were held entitled on 
their reference, so we would not go into desultory details to that effect, 
so as to avoid the repetition.

                  R.F.AsNo.83,84,53/2014 & 155/2016 
 
 
 
17.  
Section 23 of the “Act” provides the mechanism for the 
determination of compensation for its award to the landowners in lieu of 
acquisition of their land. For ready reference and convenience, same is 
reproduced below: - 
“23. Matters to be considered in determining compensation.– 
(1) In determining the amount of compensation to be awarded for 
land acquired under this Act, the Court shall take into 
consideration– 
Firstly, the market value of the land at the date of the publication 
of the notification under section 4, sub-section (1); 
Secondly, the damage sustained by the person interested, by 
reason of the taking of any standing crops or trees which may be 
on the land at the time of the Collector’s taking possession 
thereof; 
Thirdly, the damage (if any) sustained by the person interested, 
at the time of the Collector’s taking possession of the land, by 
reason of severing such land from his other land. 
Fourthly, the damage (if any) sustained by the person interested, 
at the time of the Collector’s taking possession of the land, by 
reason of the acquisition injuriously affecting his other property, 
movable or immovable, in any other manner, or his earnings; 
Fifthly, if, in consequence of the acquisition of the land by the 
Collector, the person interested is compelled to change his residence 
or place of business, the reasonable expenses (if any) incidental to 
such change; and 
Sixthly, the damage (if any) bona fide resulting from diminution of the 
profits of the land between the time of the publication of the 
declaration under section 6 and the time of the Collector’s taking 
possession of the land. 
(2)  
In addition to the market-value of the land as above 
provided, the Court shall award a sum of fifteen per centum on such 
market-value, in consideration of the compulsory nature of the 
acquisition. 
(3) 
For the purpose of clause first of sub-clause (1) of this 
section the market value of the land shall be determined on the 
basis of the average net income of that land for the five years 
preceding 1st September, 1961: 
Provided that if in any of these years that land or any portion of it 
has not been cultivated, the net income of such land or portion in 
that year shall be taken to be three times the land revenue 
assessed thereon, if no land revenue has been so assessed, three 
times the lowest rate of land revenue assessed on neighboring 
land; 

10 
 
 
 
                  R.F.AsNo.83,84,53/2014 & 155/2016 
 
 
 
Provided further that in respect of land which is situated in town 
or village abadi or land which is attached to a house, 
manufactory, or other building and is reasonably required for the 
enjoyment and use of the house, manufactory, or building, the 
market-values shall be the market-value according to the use to 
which the land was being put on the 1st September, 1961.” 
From the bare reading of the above provision, it is apparent that the 
intent of legislature was to give it wider scope so the factors for the 
purpose of determination of compensation cannot be restricted to some 
specific conditions. While interpreting the true import of section 23 of 
the “Act”, the Superior Courts have outlined the salient features to be 
taken into consideration for assessing the compensation of acquired 
land. Most commonly derived of which are as under: - 
(a) 
its market value at the prevalent time and its potential; 
(b) 
one year average of sale taken place before publication of 
notification under section 4 of the Act of the similar land; 
(c) 
its likelihood of development and improvement; 
(d) 
a willing purchaser would pay to a willing buyer in an 
open market arms length transaction entered into without 
any compulsion; 
(e) 
loss or injury occurred by severing of acquired land from 
other property of the land owner; 
(f) 
loss or injury by change of residence or place of business 
and loss of profit; 
(g) 
delay in the consummation of acquisition proceedings 
and; 
(h) 
peculiar facts and circumstances of each case. 
18.  
Section 23 of the “Act”, thus, does not hinge upon a single 
factor, rather it provides for various matters to be taken into 
consideration while determining compensation. Initially, there was a 
trend that while determining the compensation, market value of the land 
at the date of publication of notification under section 4 of the “Act” 
was mainly taken into consideration but with the passage of time, law to 
this effect has gone under radical change and now the dominant factor 
is the potential value of the land. Market value is only one of such 
factors to be considered for the purpose of award of compensation to the 

11 
 
 
 
                  R.F.AsNo.83,84,53/2014 & 155/2016 
 
 
 
land owners. Location, neighborhood, potentiality or other benefits, 
which may ensue from the land in future could not be ignored. The most 
dominant and guiding factor would be that the compensation should be 
determined at the price, which a willing buyer would pay to a seller as 
per his satisfaction. But at the same time, one cannot lose sight of the 
fact that compensation cannot be awarded to the “land owners” as a 
bounty of state.  
19.  
It would not be out of context to mention here that initially the 
term “potential value” was not so recognized to section 23 of the “Act” 
but gradually it attained paramount importance and became the most 
dominant factor for the determination of compensation. Reference to this 
effect can be made to AIR WEAPON COMPLEX through DG versus 
MUHAMMAD ASLAM and others (2018 SCMR 779). In the recent past, 
this Court has also reiterated the above principles in the case of 
PERVAIZ AKHTAR and others v. LAND ACQUISITION COLLECTOR 
and others (PLD 2022 Lahore 730) but the most recent case is 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN through Ministry of Defence 
Rawalpindi and others v. Mst. ZAKIA BEGUM and others (PLD 2023 
Supreme Court 277). The relevant extract from the same is reproduced 
below: - 
“11. 
The law of acquisition is confiscatory in nature and 
easily deprives an individual of their property and all rights 
attached to it. The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 (Constitution) gives every citizen the right to 
acquire, hold and dispose of property in every part of Pakistan 
under Article 23. Property has been interpreted to mean and 
include a right of proprietorship and includes every possible 
right or interest abstract or concrete. It includes the right to 
own, possess and enjoy the property (Pakcom Limited and 
others v. Federation of Pakistan and others PLD 2011 SC 44). 
The right to own property being a fundamental right is 
inclusive of the right to possession, right of control and the 
right to derive income from the property. Accordingly, the 
right to own property under Article 23 of the Constitution 
means the right to own economically productive property 
associated with agriculture, commerce, industry and business. 
Hence, it is a source of livelihood and provides economic 
security to a person. This goes to the underlying right to 
dignity of an individual and their home, as prescribed in 
Article 14 of the Constitution. Article 24 of the Constitution 

12 
 
 
 
                  R.F.AsNo.83,84,53/2014 & 155/2016 
 
 
 
protects the right to own property such that no person can be 
deprived of his property save in accordance with law under 
Article 24. The exception to this fundamental right as per 
Article 24 is compulsory acquisition for public purpose, which 
means that the State can acquire private property for public 
purpose under the authority of law, which provides for 
compensation and either fixes the compensation or provides 
for a mechanism to fix compensation. The Constitution, 
therefore, mandates that if there is any acquisition by the 
State, it will be under a Statute, which provides for due 
process and compensation. So the Constitution has ensured 
that if acquisition is necessary it comes at a cost, which is 
compensation. The right to compensation under the authority 
of a law has a constitutional underpinning that is the 
protection given to the right to own property. In the context of 
acquisition it means that a person who owns property has to be 
compensated on account of being deprived of their property. 
When a person is deprived of their right to own property, even 
if in accordance with law, they are deprived of their right to 
control, possess and earn from that property. And this 
deprivation is what must be compensated.” 
20.  
Now adverting to the matter in issue, so as to examine the 
question relating to the proper compensation to the “land owners”, it is 
observed that “land owners” in R.F.A No.83 of 2014 were owning land 
measuring 25-Kanal 13-Marla forming part of Khasra No.2144/01 and 
2144/02 out of which 19-Kanal 11-Marla was treated as commercial 
and rest as residential. Since we have already determined the status of 
acquired land as commercial in the light of our discussion in preceding 
paras, so we shall now proceed on the same analogy to this extent. At 
the cost of repetition, we observe that compensation was claimed by the 
“land owners” at the rate of Rs.10,00,000/- per Marla in their reference 
petition, which tends to Rs.20,000,000/- per Kanal. To this effect, 
statement of Muhammad Yasin Abbasi (AW-1) in the first instance is of 
significant importance. It is though stance of the “land owners” that he 
was only examined for the purpose of tendering report Exh.A1 but 
admittedly he was not summoned by the orders of the Court as is 
required under Order XVI Rule 6 of “CPC”. AW-1 was even not the 
court witness, so no other legal inference can be drawn except that he 
was produced by the “land owners” for their own cause, as such he 
shall be treated as their witness, being examined to support their claim.

21.  
 So far contention of learned counsel for the “land owners” 
that in terms of Article 134 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, AW-1 
could not be subject to cross-examination, suffice to observe that Article 
134 only immunes a witness from the test of cross-examination if he was 
summoned to produce a document but this is not the case. As already 
observed that AW-1 was never summoned as was required under Order 
XVI Rule 6 “CPC”, rather he was produced by the “land owners” as 
their own witness. Article 134 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 
would thus not come into play and as such said witness was rightly 
cross-examined. Needless to mention that AW-1 had though served in 
the revenue department but at the relevant time, he was not in service 
and apparently he appeared in his personal capacity to support the 
cause of the “land owners”. As per his statement, at the time of his 
inspection, the valuation of the commercial property was Rs.3,00,000/- 
per Kanal. AW-1 also tendered his report as Exh.A1 wherein it is 
mentioned that “land owners” demanded the compensation at the rate 
of Rs.40,000,00/- per Kanal. In this regard, we cannot ignore the 
statement of AW-2, who during cross-examination deposed as under: -  
ارایض یک وموجدہ امرٹیک وویلی دنپرہ ےس سیچپ الھک روےپ یف انکل رمکلش ےہ۔ 
22.  
It appears that the Referee Court, while ignoring the above 
noted material pieces of evidence, rested its findings mainly on Exh.A8, 
which was made part of record through the statement of counsel for the 
“land owners” depriving the “beneficiary department” to raise any 
objection qua its admissibility. Before us, to this effect both the sides 
have referred various judgments. First of the series is GULZAR 
HUSSAIN v. ABDUR REHMAN and another (1985 SCMR 301), which 
is rendered by a Bench comprising of five Hon’ble Judges of the 
Supreme Court wherein it is held as under: - 
“10.  
Section 67 of the Evidence Act lays down, the mode of 
proof of the execution of a document. As a general proposition it 
is correct to say that every document given in evidence must be 

14 
 
 
 
                  R.F.AsNo.83,84,53/2014 & 155/2016 
 
 
 
proved in the mode prescribed by this section and if it is not so 
proved it will be inadmissible in evidence. But this is subject to 
the exception in cases where proof of a document is dispensed 
with under some special provision. However, the mode of proof 
of a document is a question of procedure and is accordingly 
capable of being waived. Thus, where objection as to the manner 
of proof of a document is not taken at the time the document is 
sought to be proved in the lower Court and the document is 
exhibited and referred to, no such objection can be allowed to be 
raised in appeal or revision. This Court had occasion to 
pronounce on this legal aspect in several decisions.” 
The above principles were even reiterated in the case of MUHAMMAD 
IQBAL v. MEHBOOB ALAM (2015 SCMR 21). 
23.  
In the case of FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through 
Secretary Ministry of Defence and another v. JAFFAR KHAN and 
others (PLD 2010 Supreme Court 604), it is held by the Supreme Court 
that the document, which has not been brought on record through 
witnesses and has not been exhibited, cannot be taken into consideration 
by the Court but the facts in the said case were altogether different. In 
the case of MANZOOR HUSSAIN (deceased) through L.Rs. v. MISRI 
KHAN (PLD 2020 Supreme Court 749), the proposition is, however, 
similar and akin to the present one wherein certain documents were 
tendered in evidence by the counsel and in that backdrop, the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan observed as under: - 
“4. 
Before parting with this case we would like to 
comment on a related matter. Copies of the acknowledgement 
receipt (exhibit P4), aks shajarah kishtwar (exhibit P2), 
registered post receipt (exhibit P3), mutation (exhibit P5) and 
jamabandi for the year 2000-2001 (exhibit P6) were produced 
and exhibited by the pre-emptor's counsel, but without him 
testifying. We have noted that copies of documents, having no 
concern with counsel, are often tendered in evidence through a 
simple statement of counsel but without administering an oath 
to him and without him testifying, especially in the province 
of Punjab. Ordinarily, documents are produced through a 
witness who testifies on oath and who may be cross-examined 
by the other side. However, there are exceptions with regard to 
facts which need not be proved; these are those which the 
Court will take judicial notice of under Article 111 of the 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 and are mentioned in Article 
112, and facts which are admitted (Article 113, Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984).” 

15 
 
 
 
                  R.F.AsNo.83,84,53/2014 & 155/2016 
 
 
 
To the above effect, most recent judgment is in the case of Mst. AKHTAR 
SULTANA v. Major Retd. MUZAFFAR KHAN MALIK through his legal 
heirs and others (PLD 2021 Supreme Court 715) wherein the Supreme 
Court outlined the true import of the relevant provisions of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984 dealing with the relevancy and admissibility of 
the documentary evidence in the following manner: - 
 (i) Relevant and admissible evidence 
10. 
The Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 ("Qanun-e-Shahadat") 
governs the law of evidence in our country. The expression 
"relevancy" and "admissibility" have their own distinct legal 
implications under the Qanun-e-Shahadat as, more often than 
not, facts which are relevant may not be admissible. On the 
one hand, a fact is "relevant" if it is logically probative or dis-
probative of the fact-in-issue, which requires proof. On the 
other hand, a fact is "admissible" if it is relevant and not 
excluded by any exclusionary provision, express or implied. 
What is to be understood is that unlike "relevance", which is 
factual and determined solely by reference to the logical 
relationship between the fact claimed to be relevant and the 
fact-in-issue, "admissibility" is a matter of law. Thus, a 
"relevant" fact would be "admissible" unless it is excluded 
from being admitted, or is required to be proved in a particular 
mode(s) before it can be admitted as evidence, by the 
provisions of the Qanun-e-Shahadat. As far as the latter is 
concerned, and that too relating to documents, admissibility is 
of two types: (i) admissible subject to proof, and (ii) 
admissible per se, that is, when the document is admitted in 
evidence without requiring proof. 
(ii) Mode of proof 
11. 
Mode of proof is the procedure by which the "relevant" 
and "admissible" facts have to be proved, the manner whereof 
has been prescribed in Articles 70-89 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat. In other words, a "relevant" and "admissible" fact is 
admitted as a piece of evidence, only when the same has been 
proved by the party asserting the same. In this regard, the 
foundational principle governing proof of contents of 
documents is that the same are to be proved by producing 
"primary evidence" or "secondary evidence". The latter is only 
permissible in certain prescribed circumstances, which have 
been expressly provided in the Qanun-e-Shahadat. 
12. 
What is important to note is that, as a general principle, 
an objection as to inadmissibility of a document can be raised 
at any stage of the case, even if it had not been taken when the 
document was tendered in evidence. However, the objection as 
to the mode of proving contents of a document or its execution 
is to be taken, when a particular mode is adopted by the party 
at the evidence-recording stage during trial. The latter kind of 

16 
 
 
 
                  R.F.AsNo.83,84,53/2014 & 155/2016 
 
 
 
objection cannot be allowed to be raised, for the first time, at 
any subsequent stage. This principle is based on the rule of 
fair play. As if the objection regarding the mode of proof 
adopted has been taken at the appropriate stage, it would have 
enabled the party tendering the evidence to cure the defect and 
resort to other mode of proof. The omission to object at the 
appropriate stage becomes fatal because, by his failure, the 
party entitled to object allows the party tendering the evidence 
to act on assumption that he has no objection about the mode 
of proof adopted. 
13. 
It is also important to note that the objection as to 
"mode of proof" should not be confused with the objection of 
"absence of proof". Absence of proof goes to the very root of 
admissibility of the document as a piece of evidence; 
therefore, this objection can be raised at any stage, as the first 
proviso to Article 161 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat commands 
that "the judgment must be based upon facts declared by this 
Order to be relevant, and duly proved". In other words, when 
the Qanun-e-Shahadat provides several modes of proving a 
relevant fact and a party adopts a particular mode that is 
permissible only in certain circumstances, the failure to take 
objection when that mode is adopted, estops the opposing 
party to raise, at a subsequent stage, the objection to the mode 
of proof adopted. However, when the Qanun-e-Shahadat 
provides only one mode of proving a relevant fact and that 
mode is not adopted, or when it provides several modes of 
proving a relevant fact and none of them is adopted, such a 
case falls within the purview of "absence of proof", and not 
"mode of proof"; therefore, the objection thereto can be taken 
at any stage, even if it has not earlier been taken. 
(iii) Evidentiary value  
14. 
Once a fact crosses the threshold of "relevancy", 
"admissibility" and "proof", as mandated under the provisions 
of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, would it be said to be admitted, for 
its evidentiary value to be adjudged by the trial court. The 
evidentiary value or in other words, weight of evidence, is 
actually a qualitative assessment made by the trial judge of the 
probative value of the proved fact. Unlike "admissibility", the 
evidentiary value of a piece of evidence cannot be determined 
by fixed rules, since it depends mainly on common sense, 
logic and experience and is determined by the trial judge, 
keeping in view the peculiarities of each case.” 
24.  
Coming to the admissibility of the document Exh.A8, after 
having an overview of the principles mentioned hereinabove, it is 
observed that in the light of principles laid down in MANZOOR 
HUSSAIN (deceased) through L.Rs. v. MISRI KHAN supra, since the 
document does not come within the exceptions ordained in Articles 111, 
112 and 113 of the “Order, 1984”, so it cannot be termed as admissible. 

17 
 
 
 
                  R.F.AsNo.83,84,53/2014 & 155/2016 
 
 
 
Even otherwise, in the light of its nature being a membership form of a 
developed housing society, heavy reliance on Exh.A8, in no manner, 
would be safe for the administration of justice. 
25.  
It is also one of the contentions of learned counsel for the 
“land owners” that appeal has become barred by time on account of the 
fact that respondent No.8 was impleaded after the prescribed period of 
limitation, we may observe that it is trite law that if more than one 
appeals are arisen out of a common judgment and if one or more of 
those appeals are even barred by time, same could not be dismissed on 
account of limitation. Guidance in this respect can be sought from 
MEHREEN ZAIBUN NISA v. LAND COMMISSIONER, MULTAN AND 
OTHERS (PLD 1975 Supreme Court 397) and PRINCIPAL PUBLIC 
SCHOOL SANGOTA, GOVERNMENT OF KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA 
through Chief Secretary and others v. SARBILAND and others (2022 
SCMR 189). 
26.  
It is an oft repeated principle that a fair compensation for the 
acquired land is that which a willing vendor would accept on account of 
sale of his property. It is always bounden duty of the Land Acquisition 
Collector to take into consideration all the relevant factors, while 
determining the amount of compensation instead of relying upon the 
compensation assessed by the price assessment committee or the Board 
of Revenue. Guidance in this respect can be sought from AIR WEAPON 
COMPLEX through DG versus MUHAMMAD ASLAM and others (2018 
SCMR 779) and PROVINCE OF PUNJAB through Land Acquisition 
Collector and another versus BEGUM AZIZA (2014 SCMR 75). 
27.  
In the case of LAND ACQUISITION COLLECTOR, G.S.C., 
N.T.D.C., (WAPDA), LAHORE and another versus Mst. SURRAYA 
BEHMOOD JAN (2015 SCMR 28) the Supreme Court of Pakistan, 
while outlining the scope of Section 23 of the Act ibid held as under :- 
“9. 
The principles that can be gleaned from the aforesaid 

18 
 
 
 
                  R.F.AsNo.83,84,53/2014 & 155/2016 
 
 
 
judicial precedents are that the term "market-value" as employed 
in section 23 of the Act of 1894 implies the price that a willing 
purchaser would pay to a willing buyer in an open market arms 
length transaction entered into without any compulsion. Such 
determination must be objective rather than subjective. While 
undertaking this exercise, contemporaneous transactions of the 
same, adjoining or adjacent as well as the land in the same 
vicinity or locality; in dissenting precedents, may be taken into 
account. An award of compensation of a similar, adjacent, 
adjoining land or in respect of the land acquired in the same 
vicinity or locality cannot be ignored. The classification of the 
land in the Revenue Record cannot be the sole criteria for 
determining its value and its potential i.e. the use of which the 
said land can be put, must also be a factor. In this behalf, the use 
of the land in its vicinity needs to be examined. 
A bare reading of the provision in question i.e. section 23 of the 
Act of 1894 reveals that the landowner is entitled to 
compensation and not just market-value, hence, loss or injury 
occasioned by its severing from other property of the landowner, 
by change of residence or place of business and loss of profits 
are also relevant. The delay in the consummation of the 
acquisition proceedings cannot be lost sight of. While conducting 
the aforesaid exercise, oral evidence, if found, credible and 
reliable can also be taken into account.” 
28.  
After having threadbare discussion, we are of the considered 
view that the “land owners” in the circumstances were entitled for the 
compensation at the rate of Rs.20,00,000/- (twenty lacs) per Kanal but 
the referee court held them entitled to the compensation at the rate of 
Rs.60,00,000/- per kanal without properly evaluating the evidence. 
29.  
So far “land owners” in R.F.A No.53 of 2014 are concerned, 
they were deprived of land measuring 136 Kanal 5 Marla falling in 
Khasra Nos.1842 to 1850. Their land was though in the compact form as 
is evident from ‘Aks Shajra Kishtwar’ Exh.A6 but it was also 
categorized in different kinds as of nature and compensation as well 
without assigning any reasoning. Land in question is situated in the 
proximity of other acquired land and cannot be bifurcated. Law does not 
allow any discrimination amongst the equal. “Land owners” therein are 
thus also entitled for similar treatment in the matter of compensation.  
30.  
Last is R.F.A No.155/2016 wherein the “land owner” was 
holding title of land measuring 4-Kanal bearing Khasra Nos.2144/2 & 

19 
 
 
 
                  R.F.AsNo.83,84,53/2014 & 155/2016 
 
 
 
2145 like the “land owners” in R.F.A No.83 of 2014 but strangely 
enough he has been awarded Rs.6,00,000/- per kanal as compensation 
by Referee Court much less to the said “land owners”. Apparently, there 
are though no distinctive features in the case of “land owners” in this 
appeal but he has been treated in a discriminatory manner, which 
clearly offends the mandate of Article 25 of the Constitution of the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. 
31.  
The nutshell of above discussion is that this appeal is partly 
allowed in terms of para-28 above while maintaining the ancillary relief 
awarded by the Referee Court to the “land owners”.
