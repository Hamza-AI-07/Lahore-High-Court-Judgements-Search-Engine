The Commissioner Inland Revenue & another 
J U D G M E N T 
Date of Hearing. 
18-12-2023 
APPLICANT BY: 
Mr. Shoaib Rashid, Advocate. 
RESPONDENTS BY: 
M/s Asma Hamid, Hasan Ali, Noor Ahsan and 
Sana Azhar, Advocates. 
 
Shahid Karim, J:-. This judgment will also decide 
connected reference application ITR No.45067 of 2023 
which relates to tax year 2014.  For that tax year, the 
Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) decided the 
appeal against the applicant which was affirmed by the 
Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue.  For the tax year 
2015 which is the subject matter of ITR No.72345 of 
2023, the CIR (A) taking a contrary view decided the 
issue engaged in favour of the applicant in the following 
terms: 
“7.9 
The arguments of the AR heard, record 
perused and ground of appeal and impugned order is 
consulted.  In view of the above referred facts/ 
submissions of the case and provisions of law, I find 
myself in agreement with the submissions made by the 
learned AR.  The  learned Additional Commissioner 
Inland Revenue was not justified in charging the 
minimum tax on turnover that do not pertains to the 
appellant and is being offered for tax by the 
respective Distribution Companies.   The minimum 
tax u/ s 113 of the Ordinance can’t be charged twice 
on the same turnover.  The action of ADCIR is held 
illegal and findings in impugned order remain 
unimpressive.  Hence, I am of the affirmed view that 
charge made by the ADCIR on this account is not 
maintainable being arbitrary, hence is deleted.” 
 

 
ITR No.72345 of 2023

2. 
In the opinion of CIR (A) the Additional 
Commissioner Inland Revenue (ADCIR) was not 
justified in charging minimum tax on turnover that did 
not relate to the applicant (National Transmission & 
Despatch Company) (“NTDC”) and was being offered 
for tax by the distribution companies.  In other words, 
the minimum tax under Section 113 of the Income Tax 
Ordinance, 2001 (“the Ordinance”) in the opinion of 
CIR (A) cannot be charged twice on the same turnover.  
While so holding the order of ADCIR was set aside and 
the addition was deleted.  The Appellate Tribunal by its 
two separate orders which are under challenge in these 
reference applications dismissed the appeal filed by 
NTDC while allowing the appeal of the Department (in 
the other case) and based its decision on similar 
premises.  The controversy has generated the following 
questions of law which would be sufficient for decision 
on the issues raised in these reference applications: 
i) 
Whether the learned Tribunal failed to apply the law 
laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan 
in the judgment reported as 2018 SCMR 894 in the 
case of PSO Vs. CIT, while the impugned demand of 
Rs.8,557,843,410/- evidently exceeds the declared 
income at Rs.278,482,391/- (even the income assessed 
by the respondent No.2 at Rs.2,175,592,464/-)? 
ii) 
Whether the learned Tribunal was justified to 
overrule the appellate order passed by the 
Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) without any 
rebuttal of the findings in the appellate order and 
considering the reasons for annulling the impugned 
demand? 
iii) 
Whether the learned Tribunal proceeded whimsically 
in presuming imaginary business of sale and 
purchase of electricity by the applicant on its own 
behalf 
without 
reading 
the 
definition 
of 
“Transmission Business” under Clause (XXVII) of 

 
ITR No.72345 of 2023 
3 
 
Article 1 of the Transmission License issued by 
NEPRA for the business regulated under the law? 
iv) 
Whether the learned Tribunal’s findings based upon 
the misdescription of procurement and delivery of 
electricity as purchases and sales thereof are 
inconsistent with the law laid down by the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court in the judgment reported as PLD 
1985 SC 109 and the Sale of Goods Act, 1930? 
v) Whether the impugned demand of Rs.8,557,843,410/- 
is repugnant to section 113(2)(b) as the applicant did 
not derive any income at all from procurement and 
delivery of electricity at cost on behalf of DISCOs? 
 
3. 
The parties are on common ground that prior to 
June 3, 2015 NTDC was engaged in procurement of 
electricity and in providing transmission service to 
distribution companies (DISCOs).  The procurement 
was made from Generation Companies (GENCOs).  
After June 3, 2015 another company was carved out viz.  
Central Power Purchasing Agency (Guarantee) Limited 
(CPPA-G) which was then tasked with the procurement 
of electricity from GENCOs for its onward sale to 
DISCOs.  It was alleged in the show cause notices that 
NTDC had not charged minimum tax under Section 113 
of the Ordinance on the total turnover of varying 
amounts given in the show cause notices and it was 
stated that NTDC was liable for charge of minimum tax 
on the total turnover at the rate of one percent.  
Therefore, deemed assessment was sought to be held 
prejudicial to the interest of the revenue and amendment 
was proposed under Section 122(5A) of the Ordinance. 
4. 
NTDC mounted two arguments and contends that 
it acts as the agent for procurement of electricity on 
behalf of DISCOs and this is being done from GENCOs 

 
ITR No.72345 of 2023 
4 
 
under a license granted to NTDC by the National 
Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA).  The 
license is granted pursuant to section 17 of the 
Regulation of Generation, Transmission and Distribution 
of Electric Power Act, 1997 (NEPRA Act).  NTDC 
entirely relies on the terms of the licence to contend that 
it does not carry out sale of electricity to be caught by 
the mischief of ‘turnover’ in section 113(3)(a) of the 
Ordinance which provides that: 
“113 (3) (a) “turn over” means gross sales or gross 
receipts, exclusive of Sales Tax and Federal Excise 
duty or any trade discounts shown on invoices, or 
bills, derived from the sale of goods, and also 
excluding any amount taken as deemed income and is 
assessed as final discharge of the tax liability for 
which tax is already paid or payable.” 
 
5. 
The crucial aspect is regarding applicability of 
minimum tax under Section 113 of the Ordinance.  For 
the purpose, the aggregate of a person’s turnover as 
defined in section 113 has to be treated as the income of 
the person for the year chargeable to tax.  The definition 
of turnover peculiar to section 113 has been set out 
above.  In order to attract minimum tax on the basis of 
turnover the gross receipts derived from the sale of 
goods has to be taken into consideration.  NTDC 
contends that it does not derive any gross receipts from 
sale of goods (electricity in this case) and merely acts as 
the agent for procurement of electricity on behalf of 
DISCOs. 
6. 
To resolve the issue engaged in these reference 
applications, the entire structure of regulation of 

 
ITR No.72345 of 2023 
5 
 
electricity has to be kept in view which is the 
centrepiece of the system of procurement and sale of 
electricity put in place.  Hunch or personal apprehension 
of an officer of income tax department is not enough.  In 
our opinion, NTDC is a special purpose vehicle 
incorporated for a specific purpose and regarding which 
a license has been granted to it by NEPRA.  It must be 
borne in mind that NTDC is in possession of a 
transmission license and its powers are hedged in by the 
terms of that license.  Primarily, NTDC is engaged in 
transmission business which according to the license 
means that: 
“(xxvii) 
“Transmission Business” means the 
business of transmission of electric power carried on 
or to be carried on by the Licensee pursuant to and in 
accordance with the terms of this License in planning, 
development, construction and maintenance of the 
Licensee’s transmission system and operation of 
such system for the transmission and dispatch of 
electric power including the balancing services and 
inter-connection services. 
 
7. 
Thus, the transmission business has been defined 
as the business of transmission of electric power and for 
the purpose to plan, develop, construct and maintain 
NTDC’s transmission system and operation of such 
system for the transmission and dispatch of electric 
power.  That is the whole purpose of NTDC and NTDC 
is not expected to travel beyond that purpose and to 
engage in the sale and purchase of electricity.  By 
Article 2, it is provided that: 
(1) 
This License is granted to the Licensee to 
engage in the transmission business within the 
territory as set out in Schedule 1 to this Licence.” 
 

 
ITR No.72345 of 2023 
6 
 
8. 
The license is granted to NTDC to engage in the 
transmission business within the territory as set in the 
Schedule 1 to the license.  Article 2 further provides that 
licensee /NTDC shall comply with and adhere to the 
rules, regulations and directions of NEPRA from time to 
time.  The periphery of the powers of NTDC has been 
laid down in Article 2 which does not mention any 
activity relating to sale or purchase of electricity and is 
merely confined to the transmission business within the 
territory delineated in Schedule 1.  Article 5 further 
provides the exclusivity regarding the activities in the 
territory specified in Schedule 1 in respect of the 
licensee.  Learned counsel for the applicant laid stress 
upon Article 7 of the license which provides that: 
“Article 7: Procurement of Electric Power 
(1) 
Prior to the competitive market operation 
dated (CMOD) the “central power purchasing 
agency (CPPA) of the licensee to be established 
under Article 8 of this License may purchase or 
procure electric power to meet the demand of the 
eight 
ex-WAPDA 
distribution 
companies 
(XWDISCOS), on behalf of these distribution 
companies in the following terms: 
a) pending 
approval 
of 
Licensee’s 
power 
acquisition programme in terms of sub-article 
(4), the CPPA shall purchase or procure 
electric power on behalf of XWDISCOS to 
meet their demand through contracts with 
generation licensees duly approved by the 
Authority of a period not exceeding one year; 
b) following the approval of Licensee’s power 
acquisition programme in terms of sub-article 
(4), the CPPA may purchase or procure all or 
part of its power supplies from any of 
generation licensees in accordance with the 
Licensee’s power acquisition programme. 
 
 
Provided that this sub-article shall not apply 
to existing contracts between the Licensee and 
generation licensees for the purchase of electric 
power duly approved by the Authority or contracts, 
which are backed by sovereign guarantees and all 

 
ITR No.72345 of 2023 
7 
 
such contracts shall continue to remain enforceable 
up to their full term. 
 
(2) 
The CMOD is initially set as 1 July 2009.  
However the CMOD may be revised, (a) to an earlier 
date if the Authority after consultation and agreement 
of 
the 
Federal 
Government 
determines 
that 
infrastructure and market is developed to support a 
competitive trading arrangement, (b) to a later date 
in case the infrastructure or market is not adequately 
developed to support a competitive arrangement by 1 
July 2009.  In such case the Authority may in 
consultation with the Federal Government and 
stakeholders postpone the date by another year and 
further yearly extensions, subject to a maximum 
postponement of 3 years from 1 July 2009 i.e. latest 
up to 1 July 2012. 
 
(3) 
After the CMOD, the Licensee shall ensure 
that neither the Licensee nor any of its affiliate or 
related undertaking on its own or in concert with 
others purchase or acquire electric power for the 
purpose of sale to a third party save for the purpose 
of balancing services for the provision of a safe and 
reliable transmission system. 
 
 
Provided that: (a) all contracts approved by 
the Authority prior to CMOD for the purchase of 
electric power, or (b) contracts which are backed by 
sovereign guarantees, shall continue to remain 
enforceable up to their full term. 
 
(4) 
The Licensee shall, no later than 90 days 
following the date of notification of NEPRA rules 
pursuant to section 32 of the Act, submit its power 
acquisition 
programme 
to 
the 
Authority 
for 
approval.” 
 
9. 
Article 7 mentions a competitive market 
operation date (CMOD) which is June 5, 2015 as stated 
above.  Prior to that the Central Power Purchasing 
Agency (CPPA) of the licensee was to be established 
under Article 8 of the License to purchase or procure 
electric power to meet the demand of eight-ex-WAPDA 
distribution companies on behalf of those distribution 
companies and the terms were also given in Article 7.  
The entire structure under which (CPPA) was to procure 
electric power on behalf of DISCOs to meet their 

 
ITR No.72345 of 2023 
8 
 
demands through contracts with generation licensees 
was spelt out in Article 7.  It also states in clause (2) that 
competitive market operation date was initially set as 
July 1, 2009 which was revised to a later date since the 
infrastructure or market was not adequately developed to 
support a competitive arrangement by July 1, 2009.  
Articles 7 and 8 read cumulatively obliged NTDC to 
establish a central power purchasing agency (CPPA) for 
the procurement of power on behalf of DISCOs and 
other 
related 
matters 
primarily 
relating 
to 
re-
organization for the maintenance of transmission system 
and reliable operation, control, switching and dispatch of 
transmission system and generation facilities and 
provision of balancing services.   
10. 
NTDC submits that the functions of procurement 
of electric power on behalf of DISCOs as well as 
maintenance of transmission system were being 
undertaken jointly by NTDC and later on as explicated 
the business of procurement of electric power was 
carved out of NTDC and CPPA-G was established 
which now carries on the business of procurement of 
electric power exclusively. 
11. 
As adumbrated, the initial onus lay on the 
department to establish that NTDC was actually engaged 
in the business of selling of electric power and thereby 
gross receipts were accumulated which were derived 
from the sale of goods (electric power in this case).  In 
our opinion the department has failed to establish any 

 
ITR No.72345 of 2023 
9 
 
such activity to have been undertaken by NTDC.  
Seeking footing in the terms of the license which have 
been brought forth above and which leave it in no 
manner of doubt that the cardinal feature of the business 
of NTDC is circumscribed by the terms of the license 
which  by Article 2 clearly states that it can only engage 
in the transmission business.  If the allegations made in 
the show cause notices are taken as true then it must be 
established as a fact in the first instance that NTDC is in 
breach of its license granted by NEPRA.  It is nobody’s 
case that NEPRA has taken any action against NTDC 
for falling in breach of the terms of the license and, 
therefore, it can be presumed that NTDC is only 
engaged in undertaking the transmission business in 
accordance with the terms of the license. 
12. 
Through C.M No.3 of 2023, learned counsel for 
NTDC has filed documents in support of oral arguments 
made on the first day of hearing.  These documents can 
be looked at by this Court while deciding these reference 
applications, firstly because they are undisputed and 
secondly they are public documents and this Court can 
take notice of these documents in any case. 
13. 
Learned counsel for NTDC referred to decision of 
NEPRA on a petition filed by NTDC for determination 
of its transfer / billing charges for the financial year 
2012-13.  In the order itself NEPRA has determined that 
NTDC shall charge such tariff and on such terms and 
conditions as provided in the decision so made.  In the 

 
ITR No.72345 of 2023 
10 
 
background column as well the decision alludes to the 
structure and purpose of NTDC which is engaged in the 
exclusive transmission business for a term of 30 years 
and under the regime set out in the license, NTDC is 
entrusted to act as System Operator, Transmission 
Network Operator, Central Power Purchasing Power 
Agency and Contract Registrar & Power Exchange 
Administrator.  It further mentions that NTDC operates 
and maintains a network system consisting of Grid 
Station and Transmission Lines.  The tariff was 
determined by NEPRA consisting of charge through its 
users for provision of transmission and allied services 
and two-part tariff was approved by the order of 
NEPRA.  Collating different parts of the NEPRA 
decision captures the Applicant’s case in its true 
essence.  Clause 31.2.1 of the decision clearly states 
that: 
“31.2.1 
NTDC shall charge the DISCOs a 
transfer charge for procuring power from approved 
generating companies and its delivery to DISCOs for 
a billing period.” 
 
14. 
The above portion of the decision by NEPRA 
establishes that NTDC shall charge DISCOs a transfer 
charge for procuring power from approved generating 
companies and its delivery to DISCOs for a billing 
period mentioned in the clause.  There could not be a 
more clear expression of the purpose for which NTDC 
operates and conducts its business.  Moreover, clause 
31.2.2 provides that: 

 
ITR No.72345 of 2023 
11 
 
“31.2.2 
NTDC shall, for the purpose of clarity 
intimate to all DISCOs/KESC the generation part of 
the Transfer Charge during a billing period by 
deducting from the Transfer Charge the Transmission 
Charge or Use of System Charges.” 
 
15. 
Once again, further explanation can be gleaned 
from the above part of the decision which requires 
NTDC to intimate DISCOs the generation part of the 
transfer charge during a billing period by deducting from 
the Transfer charge the Use of System Charges.  
Learned counsel for NTDC has attached with the 
application by way of illustration an invoice for Energy 
Payment.  NTDC then on its terms generates a power-
electricity sales bill which includes Use of System 
Charges which is the amount that NTDC claims from 
the DISCOs.  The amounts under the head capacity 
transfer charges, energy transfer charges and total 
transfer charges are to be transferred to the respective 
GENCOs in proportion of their shares as calculated 
under the formula devised for the purpose.  These 
documents have also been relied upon by learned 
counsel for the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to 
submit to the contrary.  However, we harbour no doubt 
in our minds that NTDC generates Electricity Sales Bills 
to be paid by different DISCOs and the only amount that 
it retains is regarding Use of System Charges.  This is 
also established from the audited accounts of NTDC and 
the financial statement for the year ended June 30, 2014 
placed on record.  Clause 23 of the audited report relates 
to sales which includes use of system/ billing charges 

 
ITR No.72345 of 2023 
12 
 
and the cost of electricity.  Clause 24 elaborates the term 
‘cost of electricity’ as well as specifies the distribution 
company-wise breakup.  The cost of electricity due to 
GENCOs from the DISCOs has been elaborately dealt 
with in the audited accounts of NTDC as well.   
16. 
Learned counsel for NTDC next referred to the 
Power 
Procurement 
Agency 
Agreement 
(“the 
Agreement”) made on third day of June, 2015 between 
CPPA-G and Lahore Electricity Supply Company 
(LESCO).  Similar agreements were executed with 
other DISCOs, too.  This Agreement elaborately laid out 
the structure of procurement of electric power from 
GENCOs and for its onward transmission to the DISCOs 
and from June 3, 2015 onwards this was now being 
handled by CPPA-G.  The recitals to the Agreement 
shed light on the background of the Agreement as also 
the circumstances under which the Agreement is to 
operate as well as the bifurcation of the functions of 
NTDC which carved out the procurement of electric 
power from its primary business and devolved it upon 
CPPA-G.  The recitals are being reproduced in extenso 
hereunder:- 
1. The DISCOs is a distribution company, having the 
Distribution License to provide distribution services. 
2. Pursuant to unbundling and corporatization of 
WAPDA’s Power Wing, an Electricity Supply 
Agreements (ESA) were executed between WAPDA 
and XWDISCOs, including the DISCOs, whereby 
WAPDA was to sell electrical energy to the XW 
DISCOs and the XW DISCOs were to purchase 
electrical energy from WAPDA on the terms and 
conditions stated therein. 
3. Upon incorporation of NTDC the ESA was novated in 
favour of NTDC by way of execution of Novation of 

 
ITR No.72345 of 2023 
13 
 
ESA.  The Transmission License was also granted by 
NEPRA to NTDC. 
4. Article 8 of the Transmission License prescribed 
organizational restructuring plan for NTDC to inter 
alia establish the CPPA of NTDC.  Consequently, 
NTDC through CPPA of NTDC has been procuring 
power on behalf of the distribution companies.  The 
DISCOs is desirous to record its ratification of such 
procurement of power by CPPA of NTDC for and on 
behalf of DISCO as its agent in terms of Article 7 and 
8 of the transmission license.  
5. The transmission license and more particularly 
articles 7 and 8 thereof also envisage transition of 
power market in phases towards Competitive Trading 
Bilateral 
Contract 
Market 
(CTBCM). 
 
The 
transmission license also prescribed that NTDC shall 
also establish the Contract Registrar and Power 
Exchange Administrator (CRPEA), for recording and 
notification of contracts and other matters relating to 
bilateral trading between generation licensees and 
Bulk Power Consumers/ distribution companies for 
their future capacity needs. 
6. In view of the GOP Policy and so as to pave the way 
towards the next market development phase, CPPA-G 
was incorporated.  As a consequence the transmission 
license has been modified in order to carve out the 
CPPA functions and the CRPEA Functions from 
NTDC.  Pursuant to this a Business Transfer 
Agreement (BTA) has also been executed between 
NTDC and CPPA-G vesting the CPPA Functions and 
CRPEA functions with CPPA-G.  Further the 
commercial code shall also be proposed by CPPA-G 
and submitted to NEPRA for approval and 
notification. 
7. The DISCOs is desirous to confirm and record its 
agreement with respect to carving out of the CPPA 
function and the CRPEA function and vesting the 
same to CPPA-G on terms and conditions set forth in 
the BTA.  In furtherance of above CPPA-G in the first 
phase of its operation, on behalf of the distribution 
companies including the DISCOs is to enter into 
Administration Agreement for Power Purchase 
Agreements 
(the 
“Administration 
Agreements).  
Subsequently in the second phase to be achieved on 
or before the Completion Date (as defined in the 
Business Transfer Agreement, CPPA-G on behalf of 
the distribution companies including the DISCOs is 
also to enter into (the Post Closing Agreements). 
7.1 
Power Purchase Agreement with WAPDA for 
its hydro electric station. 
7.2 
The Power Purchase Agreement with each of 
the GENCOs for each of the operational 
thermal power plant; and 
7.3 
Assignment by way of Novation of all or any 
parts of the Power Purchase Agreement of 
Independent Power Producers under the 2002 
Policy or any other power policy of the GOP 
with NTDC. 
8. As a consequence of implementation of actions 
envisaged in recital 6 to 7 above, CPPA-G is to 

 
ITR No.72345 of 2023 
14 
 
perform the Designated Purposes and procure power 
for an on behalf of the distribution companies as per 
the regulatory framework prescribed by NEPRA and / 
or under the Commercial Code. 
9. The DISCOs is desirous of appointing the CPPA-G as 
its agent to perform the Designated Purposes, so as to 
meet its licensed obligation of supply to its customers 
on terms and conditions set forth herein. 
10. CPPA-G is desirous to confirm and record its 
agreement to act as agent of the Distribution 
companies (including the DISCOs) to perform the 
Designated purposes, on the terms and conditions set 
forth in this agreement subject to the stipulations 
prescribed as per the regulatory framework by 
NEPRA and/ or under the Commercial Code. 
 
17. 
It is clear from the recitals set out above that a 
reference was made to Article 8 of the Transmission 
License granted to NTDC which prescribes an 
organizational restructuring plan for NTDC to establish 
CPPA of NTDC.  NTDC through CPPA of NTDC had 
been procuring power on behalf of distribution 
companies and in the recitals too DISCOs recorded 
ratification of such procurement of power by CPPA of 
NTDC for and on behalf of DISCOs and as its agent in 
terms of Articles 7 and 8 of the transmission license.  
This puts paid to the contention raised by the counsel for 
FBR that after June 3, 2015 a new restructuring plan was 
put in place and prior to that NTDC was acting in a 
different capacity and so the two capacities cannot be 
intermingled.  It is clear that NTDC through CPPA of 
NTDC had been procuring power on behalf of 
distribution companies and was acting as their agent 
which has now been carved out to be converted in 
CPPA-G by the Agreement.  Subsequent to that date, an 
elaborately structured plan was put in place which will 
be adverted to in the proceeding paragraphs and from 

 
ITR No.72345 of 2023 
15 
 
which it would become evident that CPPA-G was 
established as the arm of NTDC for the purposes of 
settlement and billing in respect of procurement of 
electricity from the GENCOs and onward transmission 
to the DISCOs. 
18. 
Prior to that the issue which was confronted to 
NTDC must be stated once again and which can be 
culled out from the order to amend the assessment in 
terms of section 122(5A) of the Ordinance: 
“Perusal of Audited Accounts reveals that till June 3, 2015 
the company was engaged both in purchase/sale of 
electricity and in providing transmission services to 
DISCOs. On the said date the company had transferred its 
functions, operations, assets and liabilities related to CPPA 
and CRPEA to Central Power Purchasing Agency 
(Guarantee) Limited (CPPA-G). The company however has 
not declared revenue earned on and before this Business 
Transfer 
Agreement 
(BTA) 
which 
is 
at 
Rs.827,021,821,665/- as given at note 23 of the Audited 
Accounts. Scrutiny of your income tax return for the tax 
year 2015 reveals that you have charged turnover tax u/s 
113 of Rs.222,357,419/- and Alternate Corporate Tax 
(ACT) U/S 113-C at Rs.1,736,362,714/. Scrutiny of your 
income tax return further reveals that you have not charged 
tax u/s 113 on your total turnover of Rs.849,257,563,606/-. 
Actually you were liable to charge tax u/s 113 of the 
Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 on your total turnover @ 1% 
which comes out to Rs.8,492,575,636/-. This discrepancy 
leads to infer that your deemed assessment is erroneous in 
so far as prejudicial to the interest of revenue and requires 
amendment under section 122(5A) of the Income Tax 
Ordinance, 2001 by charging minimum tax under section 
113 at Rs.8,492,575,636/-. 
19. 
The recitals further allude to the Government of 
Pakistan Policy to pave the way towards the next market 
development phase and for which CPPA-G was 
incorporated. 
 
Recital 
6 
clearly 
mentions 
that 
transmission license has been modified in order to carve 
out the CPPA functions from NTDC and pursuant to this 

 
ITR No.72345 of 2023 
16 
 
a Business Transfer Agreement has also been executed 
between NTDC and CPPA-G vesting CPPA functions 
with CPPA-G.  A Commercial Code was also required 
to be proposed by CPPA-G and submitted to NEPRA for 
approval.  Commercial code has been approved by 
NEPRA to which a reference shall be made shortly.  The 
recitals in categoric terms confirmed and recorded the 
agreement with respect to carving out of CPPA function 
and vesting the same to CPPA-G.  Recital 9 is crucial for 
our purposes which states the desire of DISCOs of 
appointing CPPA-G as their agent to perform the 
designated purposes (also defined in the power purchase 
agreement) so as to meet the licensed obligations of 
supply to its customers.  CPPA-G in turn confirmed and 
recorded its agreement to act as agent of the distribution 
companies and to perform the designated purposes.  
Article 3 of the Agreement is the ratification clause 
whereby once again the DISCOs to the agreement 
confirmed and recorded the historical facts leading to the 
execution of PPA and acknowledged that overtime 
CPPA of NTDC entered into power purchase 
agreements for and on behalf of the distribution 
companies and proceeded to ratify and confirm that the 
acts, deeds and things done for and on behalf of the 
distribution companies including the DISCOs in 
question shall be deemed to have been carried for and on 
account of and for the benefit of the distribution 
companies.  By clause 3.1.4 the individual DISCO 

 
ITR No.72345 of 2023 
17 
 
appointed CPPA-G as its agent for the designated 
purposes and CPPA-G agreed to act in that capacity.  
This constitutes an unarguable explanation of the role of 
CPPA-G as well as an affirmation of the historical 
function carried out by CPPA of NTDC prior to 
incorporation of CPPA-G.   
20. 
Clause 3.1.6 refers to the scope of authority of 
CPPA-G and provides that: 
“3.1.6.  
The CPPA-G shall be entitled without 
prior reference to the disco to enter into: (a) 
Administration 
Agreements; 
9b) 
the 
Novation 
Agreement or the Power Purchase Agreements with 
GENCOs 
and 
WAPDA 
Hydel 
(as 
per 
the 
Administration Agreement); (c) new Power Purchase 
Agreements for procurement of Contracted Products 
in the name and on behalf of the DISCO or the 
distribution companies (as the case may be) with the 
DISCO or the distribution companies being the 
principal and primary obligor (s) under such 
agreements.” 
 
“3.1.7…. 
Provided that, title to the purchased electrical energy 
and generation capacity procured by CPPA-G for 
and on behalf of the DISCO as well as obligation of 
the DISCO to make payment of transmission charge 
or use of system charge shall always vest in DISCO 
and shall not pass to CPPA-G at any rime.” 
 
21. 
The above clause entitles CPPA-G to enter into 
agreements 
with 
GENCOs 
for 
procurement 
of 
contracted products (supply of electricity) in the name 
and on behalf of particular DISCO.  The proviso to 
clause 3.1.7 set out above emphatically provides that 
title to the purchased electrical energy and generation 
capacity procured by CPPA-G for and on behalf of 
DISCO shall always vest in the DISCO in question and 
shall not pass on to CPPA-G at any time.  This has been 
affirmed in clause 5.6.1 in the following words: 

 
ITR No.72345 of 2023 
18 
 
“5.6.1 The DISCO shall honor any power purchase 
agreements entered into by the CPPA-G on behalf of 
the DISCOs pursuant to this agreement.  The DISCOs 
shall be the principal and primary obligor in respect 
of all payments and obligations of the purchaser 
towards the seller or supplier under the power 
purchase agreements and the transmission use of 
system charge regulated and determined by NEPRA.” 
 
22. 
It is evident that the DISCOs are obligated to 
honour the PPA entered into by CPPA-G on behalf of 
DISCOs and that DISCOs are to remain the principal 
and primary obligor in respect of all payments and 
obligations of the purchaser towards the seller 
(GENCOs).   
23. 
The next phase in the restructuring was the 
Commercial Code which too has been approved by 
NEPRA under Section 35 of the NEPRA Act vide SRO 
542(I)/2015.  The Commercial Code further casts light 
on the role of CPPA and, in fact, removes the cobwebs 
surrounding the entire controversy.  By clause 5.2.1 the 
legal capacity of CPPA-G has been brought forth and 
states that: 
“5.2.1 CPPA-G has entered into back to back 
arrangements with NTDC to ensure that, following 
the transfer of business from NTDC to CPPA-G the 
functions and obligations to be performed by NTDC 
or WAPDA under power purchase contracts signed 
by NTDC or WAPDA, will continue to be assumed 
and exercised by NTDC as per its transmission 
license and the Grid Code, while CPPA-G will 
assume and exercise the functions assigned to it 
under the Market Rules, this Code and the agency 
agreements signed between CPPA-G and DISCOs.  
CPPA-G has through back to back arrangements with 
NTDC/ WAPDA,, the power to succeed to all the 
other rights and obligations of NTDC/ WAPDA under 
the existing power purchase contracts upon execution 
of appropriate contractual instruments between the 
relevant contracting parties to those instruments.” 
 

 
ITR No.72345 of 2023 
19 
 
24. 
Clause 5.2.1 further clarifies that the functions 
and obligations performed by NTDC will continue to be 
assumed and exercised as per its transmission license 
and the Grid Code while CPPA-G will assume and 
exercise the functions assigned to it under the market 
rules, the Commercial Code and the agency agreements 
signed between CPPA-G and DISCOs.  Clause 6 refers 
to the commercial transactions envisaged by the 
Commercial Code and includes the Transfer Pricing 
Mechanism for each billing period and the formula on 
the basis of which CPPA-G shall calculate the capacity 
transfer rate and energy transfer rate in accordance with 
NEPRA approved Transfer Pricing Mechanism for the 
purposes of invoices against each distribution company 
against energy and capacity purchased during the 
previous month.  The Commercial Code further alludes 
to new settlement and billing procedures to be drafted by 
CPPA-G which have to be approved within three months 
from the date of registration.  Under that procedure an 
escrow account has to be established by each 
distribution company and CPPA-G shall confirm the 
amount to be deposited into the ESCROW account of 
each Distribution company based on the price of 
generation, NTDC charges and the CPPA-G Market 
Operation fee.  Clause 8.4 relates to market settlement 
system and this, in our opinion, is at the heart of the 
entire transaction and constitutes its core.  Primary 
purpose of CPPA-G (and CPPA of NTDC previously) is 

 
ITR No.72345 of 2023 
20 
 
to administer Market Settlement System.  The procedure 
has been delineated in clause 8.4.4 which constitutes the 
following: 
i) “Calculate the settlement of PPAs and generation 
charges; 
ii) Calculate the settlement of NTDC use of system 
charges (UoS); 
iii) Calculate the CPPA-G Market Operation fee 
which shall be shared among the distribution 
companies on the basis of the energy (measured 
in KWh) delivered. 
iv) Calculate the actual deficit or surplus with 
respect to the Distribution companies Escrow 
Accounts  for payments at the payment Due Date 
after the full or partial payment by the 
distribution companies of its final settlement 
statement.” 
 
25. 
The above Market Settlement System envisages 
calculations of varying natures and includes settlement 
of power purchase agreement and generation charges, 
settlement of NTDC Use of System Charges and the 
market operation fee of CPPA-G.  It is by now clear that 
three accounts of charges are recovered under the 
Market Settlement System and the only charge for the 
settlement of NTDC is the use of system charges which 
was the case previously too.   Likewise, CPPA-G 
recovers its market operation fee and the generation 
charges are settled with the GENCOs under the CPPA-
G.  The entire Commercial Code of the restructuring to 
which reference has been made above constitutes the 
Market Settlement System at its core.  It is primarily for 
this reason that CPPA-G has been incorporated as 
without such a system in place the settlement of dues to 
different entities and persons would be well-nigh 
impossible.  Hence a central body has been incorporated 

 
ITR No.72345 of 2023 
21 
 
through which the entire settlement system operates.  
The rest of the clauses of the Commercial Code relate to 
the settlement system invoicing etc.  Clause 8.8.2 
reiterates that CPPA-G shall act as the agent of DISCOs 
without assuming payment responsibilities and the 
payment and debts shall remain with the DISCOs.  The 
ineluctable inference is that the primary and sole 
obligation for payment of supply of electric power to 
DISCOs is that of DISCOs and no such obligation 
attaches to CPPA-G.  Under the circumstances, how can 
it be held that CPPA-G is engaged in the sale of electric 
power while the payment obligation remains that of the 
DISCOs.  The purchase of electric power is made by a 
DISCO from different GENCOs; only it is done through 
CPPA-G and by CPPA of NTDC, priorly.   
26. 
A reading of the documents referred above would 
ineluctably leads to the conclusion that there is no 
difference in the functions of CPPA-G as it exists now 
and the functions being performed by CPPA of NTDC 
prior to June 3, 2015.  Further CPPA-G has been 
incorporated as a special purpose vehicle and is tasked 
with administering a Market Settlement System for the 
commercial transactions envisaged by the Agreement.  
The DISCO shall remain the principal and primary 
obligor in respect of payments and obligations of the 
purchaser (a DISCO in a particular case) towards the 
seller or supplier (GENCOs) under the power purchase 
agreement.  NTDC merely recovers the Use of System 

 
ITR No.72345 of 2023 
22 
 
Charges and similarly CPPA-G is entitled to a Market 
Operation fee while operating the Market Settlement 
System.   
Statutory Framework: 
27. 
The case of the applicants will find further 
support by studying the statutory framework, that is, 
provisions of NEPRA Act which sets up NEPRA under 
Section 3 of the said Act.  From the applicants’ point of 
view section 16 assumes significance and relates to the 
grant of transmission licenses.  Section 17 sets up a 
National Grid Company to engage in the transmission of 
electric power.  It is a special purpose transmission 
license as evident from section 19 of the NEPRA Act 
and authorises the licensee construction, ownership, 
maintenance and operation of specified transmission 
facilities on the conditions set out in the license.  The 
responsibility of the National Grid Company is to 
operate and provide safe, reliable transmission and inter-
connected services on a non-discriminatory basis.  
Without prejudice to these responsibilities, by sub-
section (2) of section 18, the National Grid Company 
shall: 
(a) make available to the general public the tariff 
specifying the Authority’s approved rates, charges 
and other terms and conditions for transmission and 
inter-connection services; 
 
(b)… 
(c) not cause a division or any associated undertaking 
to engage in generation and distribution: 
 
28. 
Section 20 of the Act relates to distribution 
license which is granted to distribution of electric power 

 
ITR No.72345 of 2023 
23 
 
companies and likewise the duties and responsibilities of 
distribution license have been spelt out in Sub-section 
(2) of section 21 which provides that: 
“(2) The licensee shall— (a) possess the exclusive 
right to provide, for such period as may be specified 
in the licence, distribution service and to make sales 
of electric power to consumers in the territory 
specified in the licence and to frame schemes in 
respect of that territory: 
 
Provided that a generation company may make sales 
of electric power to bulk-power consumers within 
such territory as the Authority may. subject to section 
22, for a period of fifteen years, allow: 
 
(b) be responsible to provide distribution service and 
make sales of electric power within its territory on a 
non-discriminatory basis to all the consumers who 
meet the eligibility criteria laid down by the 
Authority: 
 
29. 
Therefore, it is clear that the grant of transmission 
license is distinct and separate from the issuance of a 
distribution license and distribution company in whose 
favour the license has been issued has the exclusive right 
to provide distribution services and to make sales of 
electric power to the consumers. 
30. 
We now turn to SRO 541(I)/2015 which enacts 
National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Market 
Operator Registration Standards and Procedure) Rules, 
2015.  These rules define the Central Power Purchasing 
Agency (Guarantee) Ltd. to mean that: 
(d) "Central Power Purchasing Agency (Guarantee) 
Limited or "CPPA-G" means; an entity established to 
conduct the market operations, pursuant to re-
organization of business of NTDC in furtherance of 
reform of CPPA, which presently is a division of 
NTDC. 
(g) "market operator" means the entity authorized or 
registered by the Authority under these rules to carry 
out and discharge the market operations; 
(h) "market operations" means the functions, 
operations and responsibilities to be performed and 

 
ITR No.72345 of 2023 
24 
 
discharged by the market operator, as specified in 
Schedule—II; 
 
31. 
CPPA-G is an entity established to conduct the 
market operations pursuant to re-organization of 
business of NTDC in furtherance of reform of CPPA 
which at the relevant time was a division of NTDC.  
Under the Rules, it has to act as market operator which 
means an entity authorized by the Authority to carry out 
and discharge the market operations as specified in 
Schedule-2 as under: 
“1. The operations and responsibilities to be performed 
and discharged by the market operator, shall include the 
following in accordance with the grid code and the 
commercial code: 
(a) To acquire, take over or assume the functions and 
business of settlement and development of competitive 
power market from CPPA of NTDC and to carry on 
these functions and business; 
(b) Procurement of electric power on behalf of the 
DISCOs, including import of power from other 
countries; 
(c) Generation invoice verification on the basis of meter 
reading or dispatch scheduling report and terms of 
the respective Power Purchase Agreements;  
(d) Billing to the DISCOs based on the meter readings at 
Common Delivery Points as per the procedure 
defined in the commercial code; 
(e)  Collection from the DISCOs and settlement to the 
market . participants as per the commercial code; and  
(f) Management of cash flow, treasury management and 
other relevant banking functions for the purposes of 
collection and disbursement as per the commercial 
code. 
 
32. 
The functions specified in Schedule 2 to the 
Rules and set out above leave it in no manner of doubt 
that CPPA-G acquired the function and business of 
settlement and development of competitive power 
market from CPPA of NTDC.  This proves beyond any 
shadow of doubt that CPPA-G is merely a successor of 
CPPA of NTDC and continues to carry on those 

 
ITR No.72345 of 2023 
25 
 
functions and business.  This would be enough to stunt 
the argument of the learned counsel for FBR that the 
situation prior to incorporation of CPPA-G must be dealt 
with on a separate set of circumstances.  Schedule 2 set 
out above further provides the procurement of electric 
power on behalf of DISCOs by CPPA-G and to issue a 
bill to DISCOs based on meter readings at common 
delivery points as per the procedure defined in the 
Commercial Code.  Further, CPPA-G is tasked with 
collection from the DISCOs and settlement to the market 
participants as per the Commercial Code.  It is clear that 
CPPA-G has been assigned the task of settlement in 
respect of market participants which term has been 
defined in the Rules and comprises a generation 
company, NTDC and distribution companies.  It 
operates a common delivery point and manages the cash 
flow for the purposes of collection and disbursement and 
in sum carries out the business of settlement as per 
Commercial Code.  Priorly, this function and business 
was being performed by CPPA of NTDC as one of the 
divisions of NTDC.  The remainder of the Rules refer to 
the obligations of the market participants towards the 
market 
operator, 
financial 
organizational 
affairs, 
accounting practices and audit and matters relating to 
resolution of disputes.  Learned counsel for FBR besides 
challenging the very basis of NTDC to act as the agent 
for DISCOs and GENCOs, took exception to the 
documents produced before this Court by NTDC and 

 
ITR No.72345 of 2023 
26 
 
states that fresh documents could not be allowed to be 
considered at this stage.  This is a fallacy; firstly because 
these documents are public documents and were 
required to be produced by this Court in order to 
understand the historical basis of setting up of NTDC 
and its purpose.  None of these documents are disputed 
by FBR.  Secondly, FBR also produced a paper book 
which contained most of the documents relied upon by 
NTDC. 
33. 
Learned counsel next contended that regardless of 
whether purchase of electric power is on behalf of the 
DISCOs, it constitutes sale/ purchase in its essence.  
This contention has no basis as the entire statutory and 
structural framework brought forth above clearly shows 
that although the invoice is issued by NTDC, this does 
not constitute sale and the purpose of NTDC was merely 
to act as an agent for settlement and this purpose cannot 
be lost sight of at the whims of FBR.  The power/ 
electrical sales bill issued by NTDC for collection from 
DISCOs has also been relied upon by learned counsel 
for FBR and it clearly contains separate heads under 
which the invoice is being raised and includes the 
component to be paid by the DISCOs in respect of sale 
of electricity.  
34. 
Learned counsel for FBR laid great stress on 
clause 5 of Second Schedule to the Ordinance which 
was amended on 21.2.2008 by SRO 171(I)/2008 and 
provides that: 

 
ITR No.72345 of 2023 
27 
 
“Where the corporatized entities of Pakistan Water 
and Power Development Authority (DISCOs) and 
National Transmission and Despatch Company 
(NTDC), are required to pay minimum tax under 
Section 113, the purchase price of electricity shall be 
excluded from the turnover liable to minimum tax up 
to the year 2013”. 
 
35. 
The above clause introduced reduction in tax 
liability of DISCOs and NTDC which was omitted by 
Finance Act, 2014.  By the omission learned counsel 
invites this Court to hold that after July, 2014 the 
purchase price of electricity shall be included in the 
turnover of NTDC.  This argument ignores the words 
“where the corporatized entities of Pakistan Water and 
Power Development Authority (DISCOs) and National 
Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC), are 
required to pay minimum tax under Section 113”.  These 
words clearly mean that the clause will apply where 
NTDC is required to pay minimum tax under Section 
113 and not otherwise.  Be that as it may, the exclusion 
of the clause through Finance Act, 2014 will have no 
impact on the controversy involved and which it turn on 
the true construction of the word “turnover” in section 
113 of the Ordinance as applicable to NTDC.  This 
construction has already been made in the forthcoming 
paragraphs by this Court and we are constrained to hold 
that notwithstanding an exemption or reduction in tax 
liability, NTDC does not carry out sale of goods, that is, 
electric power in the present case to be included in the 
term ‘turnover’ as defined in section 113 of the 
Ordinance.  It is admitted by learned counsel for FBR 

 
ITR No.72345 of 2023 
28 
 
that at present DISCOs are paying minimum tax on 
turnover including purchase price of electricity.  Thus, 
the electricity which is purchased from GENCOs by 
DISCOs is made liable to minimum tax on the turnover 
of DISCOs and FBR cannot be heard to demand that tax 
from NTDC as well.  Obviously, it is not the case of 
FBR that firstly the purchase of electricity is done by 
NTDC and thereafter NTDC sells electric power to 
DISCOs at inflated price.  No evidence has been 
produced to that effect and in any case NTDC would be 
falling in breach of its transmission license if it were to 
engage in such a business. 
36. 
As a result, we answer the questions of law raised 
in these Reference Applications in favour of the 
applicant/ NTDC.  The Reference Applications are 
allowed. The impugned orders are set aside. 
A copy of this order shall be sent to the Tribunal under 
the Seal of the Court.
