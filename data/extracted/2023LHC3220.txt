Respondents by: 
Mr. Tahir Mehmood Jatoi, Advocate. 
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.:- Through instant 
revision petition, petitioner has challenged judgment dated 29.05.2014, 
passed by learned District Judge, Bahawalnagar, whereby appeal filed 
by respondents No. 2 to 5 against order dated 24.04.2014 suspending 
implementation of order dated 07.02.2007, regarding change of design 
and size of outlet in question was allowed and plaint of the suit was 
rejected under Order VII Rule 11 CPC being barred by law.  
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that petitioner filed suit for declaration 
along with permanent injunction, which was accompanied by an 
application for grant of temporary injunction. Learned Trial Court, vide 
order dated 24.04.2014 issued ad-interim injunctive order thereby 
suspending implementation of order dated 07.02.2007, which was 
assailed by respondents No. 2 to 5 by way of filing appeal. Learned 
Appellate Court, vide order dated 29.05.2014, proceeded to allow the 
appeal and rejected the plaint of the suit under Order VII Rule 11 CPC. 
Hence, instant revision petition.

3. 
Learned counsel for petitioner submits that impugned judgment 
rendered by the learned lower Appellate Court is against the law and 
facts. Adds that even the appeal filed by respondents No. 2 to 5 was 
not competent against an interim order and in given circumstances, 
petitioner’s suit / plaint could not be rejected on the ground of 
limitation as from the stance taken up by the petitioner, it was for all 
intents and purposes a mixed question of law and facts, which could 
only be resolved after framing of issues. He adds that learned lower 
Appellate court has misinterpreted and misapplied the applicable law 
and has committed material irregularity and illegality. In support, he 
has referred to Jewan and 7 others v. Federation of Pakistan through 
Secretary, Revenue, Islamabad and 2 others (1994 SCMR 826), Haji 
Muhammad Shah v. Sher Khan and others (PLD 1994 Supreme 
Court 294), Mushtaq Hussain v. Province of Punjab through Collector 
Jhelum District and 6 others (2003 MLD 109), Anwar Khan v. Abbas 
Khan (2003 YLR 712), Iftikharul Haq v. District Canal Officer and 
others (2005 CLC 1740) and Mujahidabad Welfare and Development 
Organization JUTAL through Members v. Provincial Government 
through Chief Secretary Gilgit-Baltistan and others (2022 YLR 565). 
4. 
Contrarily, learned Law Officer, while relying upon Kamran 
Industry (Pvt.) Ltd. V. Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan 
through Regional Manager, Regional Office, Lahore and 2 others 
(1994 SCMR 1970), defends the impugned judgment.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused. 
6. 
Petitioner filed suit for declaration along with permanent 
injunction contending therein that design and size of petitioner’s outlet 
No. 12/6-R is approved as 12” dia pipe as per A-Form No. 4054 dated 
31.05.2001, whereas A-form No. 512 dated 07.02.2007, whereof 
design and size of outlet has been altered as OC-OFRB and B=0.20, 
Y=0.7H, being against the law and facts, record, without issuance of 
prior notice and based upon mala fide, is liable to cancellation, wherein 
following ad-interim injunctive order was passed by learned Trial 
Court:- 
“Preliminary arguments on the application for grant of interim 
injunction have been heard and record perused. In view of record /

C.R. No. 568 of 2014/BWP  
documents attached with the suit and affidavit submitted by the 
petitioner, matter needs consideration, therefore, implementation of 
order dated 07.02.2007 is suspended. However, this order shall 
have no affect on any legal proceedings before any competent court 
/ authority.”  
 
In appeal, learned Appellate Court set aside the above order and 
rejected the plaint inter alia on the ground that the suit was barred by 
limitation.  
7. 
The question before this Court is whether the Appellate Court 
was competent to reject the plaint of the suit under Order VII Rule 11, 
C.P.C. while dealing with an appeal filed against grant of ad-interim 
injunction. No doubt an incompetent suit shall be taken off the file at 
its inception and plaintiff be allowed to retrace his steps. At the same 
time, it is settled law that plaint can be rejected even before 
summoning the defendants or later-on at any stage of suit proceedings 
but this power must be exercised by the Court where the plaint is 
pending or under challenge because scrutiny is only permissible 
pertaining to the matter pending before that Court. There is no cavil 
with the proposition that the plaint of a suit can be rejected by 
Appellate as well as Revisional Court, however, it was not proper to 
reject the plaint of the suit under Order VII, Rule 11 C.P.C. while 
dealing with an appeal filed against the order granting or refusing 
interim injunction. Admittedly, learned Appellate Court was not seized 
of the main suit as the same was pending before Learned Trial court. 
The scope of appeal before the learned Appellate Court was as to 
whether the appellant was entitled for the ad-interim injunction in 
accordance with law or not. In short, adjudication upon merits of lis / 
suit 
without 
its 
pendency 
before 
the 
appellate 
forum 
is 
restricted/prohibited. Reliance in this regard can also be placed upon 
has been taken from Nishan Ali v. Sher Muhammad and 3 others (2004 
MLD 1809), Muhammad Iqbal v. Lahore Development Authority and 
others (2005 YLR 2167), Asghar Khan v. National Bank of Pakistan 
through president and others (2013 YLR 484), Ghulam Farid and 
others v. Province of Punjab and others (2013 MLD 77) and Malik 
Waseem Khokhar v. Taimur Kamal and others (2020 CLC 315).

8. 
Needless to observe here that there is striking difference between 
the scope of proceedings of an application for grant of temporary 
injunction in a pending proceeding and the rejection of the plaint under 
Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. on account of failure to disclose a cause of 
action in the plaint or the plaint being barred under some provision of 
law. The reason for different approach while rejecting a plaint under 
Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. is quite obvious. In the former proceedings, 
even if the Court reaches the conclusion that the plaintiff has failed to 
make out a prima facie case, it can only refuse to grant temporary 
injunction, but this rejection cannot result in the dismissal of the suit 
which proceeds to trial notwithstanding a finding by the Court that the 
plaintiff has failed to make out a prima facie case for grant of 
temporary injunction. On the contrary, if the Court reaches the 
conclusion that the plaint failed to disclose any cause of action or suit 
appears to be barred under some law, the proceedings come to an end 
immediately and the plaintiff is non-suited before he is allowed an 
opportunity to lead evidence and substantiate his allegation made in the 
plaint. We are, therefore, of the view that the rejection of plaint at a 
preliminary stage when the plaintiff has not led any evidence in 
support of his / her case, is possible only if the Court reaches this 
conclusion on consideration of the statements contained in the plaint 
and other material available on record before the Court which the 
plaintiff admits as correct. Reliance is placed upon Jewan and 7 others 
v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Revenue, Islamabad and 
2 others (1994 SCMR 826).  
9. 
In the present case, matter pertaining to grant of ad-interim 
injunctive order issued by the Trial Court was called-in-question 
before the Appellate Court might be on various grounds including 
non-maintainability of suit in its present form but Court of appeal 
while deciding the appeal ought to have confined itself relating to 
availability of its jurisdiction because the plaint was not pending 
before it, therefore, it should have refrained itself from making any 
definite opinion regarding the fate of the suit. No doubt, plaint of a 
suit can be rejected by Appellate as well as Revisional Court, however, 

 
5 
C.R. No. 568 of 2014/BWP  
it was not proper for the learned Appellate Court to reject the plaint of 
the suit by invoking the provisions of Order VII Rule 11, C.P.C., while 
dealing with an appeal filed against issuance of ad-interim injunctive 
order, thus, exercise of jurisdiction by Appellate Court to reject the 
plaint of the suit not pending before it, being illegal, is liable to be set 
aside.  
10. 
Resultantly, instant petition is allowed and impugned judgment 
dated 29.05.2014, passed by learned District Judge, Bahawalnagar is 
set aside. Consequently, appeal filed by respondents No.2 to 5 shall be 
deemed to be pending before learned Appellate Court against the order 
granting ad-interim injunction, which shall be decided within a period 
of thirty days. Parties are directed to appear before the Court of learned 
District Judge, Bahawalnagar on 19.06.2023.
