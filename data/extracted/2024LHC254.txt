Mr. Asad Ali Bajwa, D.A.G. 
 
 
Shahid Karim, J:-. This constitutional petition seeks the 
following relief:  
“In the view of foregoing, it is respectfully prayed that this 
Hon’ble Court may be graciously pleased to allow this 
petition in the following terms: 
 
i. 
Declare that: 
a. To the extent of books and journals, the Impugned 
S.R.O. 
No.927(I)/2019, 
dated 
09.08.2019 
is 
unconstitutional, void ab initio and ultra vires the 
Arts. 9, 18, 19 and 175(3) of the Constitution. 
b. The right to life includes the right to research, 
knowledge, access to books and journals (for 
learning comparative views and receiving ideas). 
c. The outright ban on import of books and journals is 
not a reasonable restriction on the freedom of trade 
and press. 
d. The 
Federal 
Government 
has 
infringed 
the 
independence of the judiciary, access to justice and 
obstructed 
the 
administration 
of 
justice 
by 
prohibiting the import of law books and journals, 
which are frequently cited and relied upon by the 
learned members of the Bar and Bench in the 
ordinary course of their professional duties. 
ii. 
Alternatively, reading down the Impugned S.R.O. for 
being ambiguous, thus, not applicable to books and 
journals;  
iii. 
Grants costs of case; and 
iv. 
Grant such other relief as this Hon’ble Court may 
deem just and appropriate in all the facts and 
circumstances of the case.”

The Challenge: 
2. 
This judgment will also decide the connected petition 
W.P No.35962 of 2021 which too seeks similar relief and 
challenges paragraph 5 (2)(a) of the Import Policy Order, 
2020 dated 25.09.2020.  The only difference between the 
two petitions is that in W.P No.34660 of 2020, SRO 
927(I)/2019 (impugned SRO) was issued on 09.08.2019 
and which was to the following effect: 
“S.R.O. 927 (I)/2019.- In exercise of the powers conferred 
by sub-section (1) of section 3 of the Imports and Exports 
(Control) Act, 1950 (XXXIX of 1950), the Federal 
Government is pleased to direct that following further 
amendments shall be made in the Import Policy Order, 
2016, namely:- 
In the said Order, in paragraph 5, -- 
a) in sub-paragraph (A), in clause (ii), the following 
shall be substituted, namely:-- 
“(ii) goods of Indian or Israeli origin or imported 
from India or Israel;”; 
b) in sub-paragraph (B), clause (iii) shall be omitted.” 
 
3. 
The notification amended paragraph 5, sub-paragraph 
(A) clause (ii) and placed in the prohibition list the import of 
goods of Indian origin apart from goods of Israeli origin. 
This was done by amending SRO 345(I)/2016. The second 
amendment was deletion of para 5(B)(iii) and thereby 
removed goods of Indian origin or imported from India from 
the restriction list.  In W.P No.35962 of 2021, the challenge 
is to the Import Policy Order, 2020 (2020 Order) which 
contained paragraph 5(2)(a) and imposed a ban on the 
import of goods of Indian origin.  The 2020 Order repealed 
the 2016 Order and re-imposed the ban similar to the 
impugned SRO. Para 5(2)(a) (the Impugned Para) is 
sought to be declared ultra vires and unconstitutional. Thus, 
the issue in both the petitions converge on the same 

W.P No.34660 of 2020 
 
 
3
challenges regarding import of goods of Indian origin or 
imported from India.   
Background and arguments: 
4. 
The learned counsel for the petitioners stated on the 
threshold that the petitioners are suppliers of law books and 
journals (foreign, local and self-published) to members of 
general public, Bar Associations and Superior and Inferior 
courts.  The challenge is restricted to the extent of books and 
journals and prohibition of import of these books and 
journals of Indian origin.  The Import Policy Order, 2016 
added goods of Indian origin or imported from India in the 
prohibition list and removed goods of Indian origin from the 
restriction list.  Priorly, in view of the restriction, the goods 
of Indian origin could be imported subject to certain 
restrictions. The Import Policy Order is issued under the 
Imports & Exports (Control) Act, 1950 (“the 1950 Act”) 
which has been enacted by the Parliament to regulate 
imports and exports from Pakistan.  The Federal 
Government is empowered under Section 3(1) of the 1950 
Act to issue Orders to be published in the official gazette 
and the impugned Orders have been issued under these 
powers.  To reiterate, initially only the goods of Israeli 
origin or imported from Israel formed part of paragraph 
5(A)(ii) of the Import Policy Order, 2016 but later on 
through the impugned SRO and Para the goods from Indian 
origin were also included regarding which a complete 
prohibition was placed on their importation.  The petitioners 
contend that due to imposition of ban on books and journals 
through the impugned notifications, the market is facing a 

W.P No.34660 of 2020 
 
 
4
severe shortage of law books and no importer or publisher is 
allowed to import research materials from India.  It is 
submitted that the impugned ban has imposed a prohibition 
on the import of books and journals which is unreasonable 
restriction on a legitimate and lawful business.  In a nub, the 
petitioners contend that the ban in question has caused 
severe shortage of foreign books and journals in the market. 
These books and law journals are heavily relied upon by 
Members of the Bar and the Bench in the ordinary course of 
their professional duties. The impugned action adversely 
affects the development of legal jurisprudence, quality of 
research, provision of legal education and is tantamount to 
obstructing the administration of justice. Relevant data has 
been produced by the learned counsel for the petitioners to 
bring home the fact that Indian reprints of foreign books 
imported from India are considerably cheaper to be imported 
as compared to their import from other countries like United 
States of America and United Kingdom.  As an illustration, 
for the established treaties of constitutional law by Rotunda 
and Novak, the original price is US Dollars 989 whereas the 
Indian reprint can be obtained on considerably lesser price.  
The same is the case with All England Law Reports where a 
set has an original price of 1260 GPB whereas the Indian 
reprint has a price tag of 50,000/- INR.  (These prices should 
vary currently and the difference may be considerably more 
at the present time).   
Legal framework: 
5. 
Section 3 of the 1950 Act provides that: 
“3. POWERS TO PROHIBIT OR RESTRICT IMPORTS AND 
EXPORTS: 

W.P No.34660 of 2020 
 
 
5
 
(1) The Federal Govt. may, by an order published in the Official 
Gazette and subject to such conditions and exceptions as may be 
made by or under the order, prohibit, restrict or otherwise 
control the import and export of goods of any specified 
description, or regulate generally all practices (including trade 
practices) and procedure connected to the import or export of 
such goods and such order may provide for applications for 
licenses under this Act, the evidence to be attached with such 
applications, the grant, use, transfer, sale or cancellation of such 
licenses, and the term and manner in which and the periods 
within which appeals and applications for review or revision may 
be preferred and disposed of, and the charging of fees in respect 
of any such matter as may be provided in such order. 
 
(2) No goods of the specified description shall be imported or 
exported except in accordance with the conditions of a license to 
be issued by the Chief Controller or any other officer authorized 
in this behalf by the Federal Government. 
 
(3) All goods to which any order under subsection (1) applies 
shall be deemed to be goods of which the import or export has 
been prohibited or restricted under section 16 of the Customs 
Act, 1969(IV of 1969), and all the provisions of that Act shall 
have effect accordingly. 
 
(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in the aforesaid Act the 
Federal Government may, by an Order published in the official 
Gazette, prohibit, restrict or impose conditions on the clearance 
whether for home consumption or warehousing or shipment 
abroad of any imported goods or class of goods.” 
 
6. 
The provision set out above empowers the Federal 
Government by an order published in the official gazette and 
subject to such conditions and exceptions as may be made to 
prohibit, restrict or otherwise control the import and export 
of goods of any specified description or regulate generally 
all practices and procedure connected to the import or export 
of such goods.  Further, such an order may provide for 
applications for licenses under this Act and the terms and 
manner in which and the periods within which appeals and 
applications for review or revision may be preferred and 
disposed of.  It is conceded that the matter relating to power 
to prohibit or restrict imports and exports is a policy matter 
within the domain of the executive branch of the 
government and it is a rarity indeed for the Courts to 
interfere in such matters. It is this rule of deference on the 

W.P No.34660 of 2020 
 
 
6
basis of which this Court will proceed to determine the 
issues engaged in these petitions. Another guiding pollstar 
for this Court is the scope of judicial review as expressed by 
Lord Brightman (UK Supreme Court) in Chief Constable v 
Evans (1982) All ER 141, 154 in the following terms: 
“Judicial Review is concerned not with the decision, but the 
decision-making process. Unless that restriction of the 
power of the Court is observed, the Court will, in my view, 
under the guise of preventing the abuse of power, be itself 
guilty of usurping power.” 
 
7. 
It is also a rule established by respectable authority that 
the discretion vesting in the Federal Government is to be 
exercised reasonably and rationally.  The decision-maker 
cannot be left adrift on a sea of factors without guidance. It 
is undisputed that the first prohibition was placed by SRO 
927 and since then there is no revision in the policy of the 
Federal Government to allow the goods of Indian origin to 
be imported from India.  In fact, the prohibition has 
continued during the Import Policy Order, 2020.  As 
explicated, any discretion vesting in the Federal Government 
cannot be exercised so as to impinge upon the rights 
guaranteed by the Constitution as also can be judged on 
other principles of public law such as rationality and 
reasonableness. 
8. 
Indubitably, greater significance must attach to the 
words ‘of goods of any specified description’ as used in 
section 3 of 1950 Act. The true construction must be that 
this does not confer a sweeping power on the Federal 
Government to prohibit import or export of all goods from 
any country and the power lies merely to prohibit or restrict 
‘goods of any specified description’.   As a matter of policy 

W.P No.34660 of 2020 
 
 
7
of the law, the Federal Government should only prohibit 
specified goods and simultaneously retain power to review 
the prohibition on a case to case basis. Both these 
connotations can be culled out from a reading of section 3 of 
the 1950 Act and the Impugned Para which provides in full, 
that: 
“(2) Import of the followings are banned, namely:- 
(a) goods of Indian or Israeli origin or imported 
from India or Israel: 
Provided that the provisions of this clause to the extent 
of India shall not apply to therapeutic products 
regulated by the Drug Regulatory Authority of 
Pakistan.” 
 
9. 
It can be seen that an exception was carved out and the 
provisions of the clause, to the extent of India, were not 
made applicable to therapeutic products regulated by the 
Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan. Thus it was felt by 
policy-makers that a complete ban was not conducive and 
obviously unhelpful. The prohibition could not be a 
regulatory straightjacket. The case of therapeutic products 
must have been presented to the Federal Government upon 
which an exception was created in their favour. This could 
be the case with law books and journals as well. The Federal 
Government cannot shut its doors to requests for waiver of 
prohibition in favour of certain other products. Yet no 
procedure has been prescribed to consider such requests. If 
the matter of prohibition and restriction is a policy decision, 
then the related matter of revision of such decision is a 
policy matter too. This is a requirement of fair and equal 
process.  Both the prohibition and the manner to reconsider 
that prohibition must form part of the same regime. This 
brings us to section 3 of the 1959 Act that alludes to ‘the 

W.P No.34660 of 2020 
 
 
8
term and manner in which and the periods within which 
appeals and applications for review or revision may be 
preferred’. Doubtless, the reference is to the procedure for 
seeking review of a decision to prohibit import of specific 
goods and appellate forums to be setup. Such a course has 
not been supplied although the mandate of law compels that 
persons affected by an Import Policy Order may have the 
opportunity to put forth their cases for review of the 
condition of prohibition or restriction. For, there may be a 
host of conditions to require a change of policy. The 
petitioners at least have a right to request that a change   be 
brought about in respect of the goods that they intend to 
import.  It is acknowledged that a wide margin of judgment 
must be afforded to the government, but it is equally true 
that that judgment may be remarkably cramped and could be 
overturned upon cogent grounds.  
Seen against Constitutional Rights: 
10. There is no doubt that the import of books and journals 
of Indian origin and in particular the Indian reprints of 
foreign books imported from India would be considerably 
cheaper and in respect of the data placed on record by the 
petitioner, there is no rebuttal on the part of the respondents.  
In reply to the contents of these petitions, the respondent 
No.3 which is the Ministry of Commerce, Government of 
Pakistan has proferred the following reasons for imposing 
ban on the import of goods from India: 
“Admitted to the extent that the Ministry of Commerce, in 
compliance with decision of the Federal Cabinet, issued the 
SROs 927(I)/2019 and 928(I)/2019 dated 09-08-2019 
(Annex-X), whereby imports from and exports to India were 
banned for all kinds of goods, including books and journals.  
However, petitioners’ contention that the said SROs (to the 

W.P No.34660 of 2020 
 
 
9
extent of import of book from India) is ultra vires of the 
constitution is vehemently denied.  The Federal Government 
is competent to ban one or all goods or class of goods from 
any one or from world-wide sources.  The Federal 
Government draws its powers from Article 99 of the 
Constitution and with the Rules of Business 1973, and 
section 3(1) of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, 1950.  
Moreover, India is neither an authority on any field of 
knowledge nor enjoys monopoly over wisdom.  As such 
banning imports from India including those of books/ 
journal does not infringe any of the Fundamental rights of 
the Petitioners, enshrined in the Constitution of Pakistan.  
Further, the Honourable Court would appreciate that the 
enjoyment of fundamental rights by citizen of Pakistan is 
subject to reasonable restrictions imposed in the national of 
public interest.  This particular executive action, i.e. 
suspension of trade with India, has been taken in the context 
of Pakistan’s national interest and long standing stance on 
Kashmir.  In view of the above, Government’s decision to 
ban all kinds of imports/exports including books/journals 
from India has been taken in accordance with the 
Constitution, law (Imports and Exports (Control) Act and 
Policy of the State of Pakistan on the Kashmir dispute.” 
 
11. It is stated in the extract reproduced above that the 
decision to ban imports from India was taken by the Federal 
Government and it includes books and journals.  It is further 
stated that the Federal Government is competent to ban one 
or all goods or class of goods from any source world-wide.  
There is no denial to this fact.  However, the issue relates to 
the exercise of discretion which has to be based on 
intelligible criteria and reasonableness. 
12. Learned counsel for the petitioners relied upon Article 
18 of the Constitution which provides that: 
“18. Freedom of trade, business or profession: Subject to 
such qualifications, if any, as may be prescribed by law, 
every citizen shall have the right to enter upon any lawful 
profession or occupation, and to conduct any lawful trade 
or business: 
Provided that nothing in this Article shall prevent— 
(a) the regulation of any trade or profession by a licensing 
system; or  
(b) (b) the regulation of trade, commerce or industry in the 
interest of free competition therein; or 
(c) the carrying on, by the Federal Government or a 
Provincial Government, or by a corporation controlled by 
any such Government, of any trade, business, industry or 
service, to the exclusion, complete or partial, of other 
persons. 
 

W.P No.34660 of 2020 
 
 
10
13. The fundamental right enshrined in Article 18 grants to 
citizens the right to enter upon any lawful profession or 
occupation and to conduct any lawful trade or business but 
this has been made subject to such qualifications as may be 
prescribed by law.   
14. Article 18 fell for determination before a Full Bench of 
this Court and in a judgment reported as City School Private 
Limited v. Govt. of the Punjab etc. (2018 PLD 509) the 
sweep of Article 18 was elaborated as follows:- 
“2. In the beginning, some general observations regarding 
the fundamental right enshrined in Article 18 of the 
Constitution may be made. This fundamental right is at the 
forefront of the arguments addressed by the learned counsel 
for the petitioners and the precise scope of this right was at 
the heart of the arguments addressed by counsels of both 
the sides of the aisle. 
3. Let us begin by some observations by Lord Parker in 
Adelaide Steamship Co. (1913) AC 718 (PC), as regards the 
right to carry on trade or business which is inherent in 
every member of the community at common law: 
“At common law every member of the community is 
entitled to carry on any trade or business he chooses 
and in such manner as he thinks most desirable in his 
own interest and inasmuch as every right connotes an 
obligation, no one can lawfully interfere with another 
in the free exercise of his trade or business, unless 
there exists some just cause or excuse for such 
interference…Speaking generally, it is in the interest 
of every individual member of the community that he 
should be free to earn his livelihood in any lawful 
manner and in the interest of the community that every 
individual should have this freedom.” 
4. The above observations were quoted by Cornelius J. in 
East and West Steamship Co. v. Pakistan (PLD 1958 SC 
(Pak) 41, 68). While dilating upon the reasons underlying 
the grant of fundamental right by Article 18, Cornelius J. 
went on to say that: 
“We may, therefore, safely conclude that among the 
considerations which guided the Constitution makers 
in the drafting of Article 12 (the present Article 18), so 
as to secure freedom to the citizens of Pakistan to 
conduct any lawful trade, the place of greatest 
importance must be given, firstly, to the necessity of 
ensuring to every individual member of the 
community, a right to engage in lawful trade 
according to his choice and to exercise that trade in a 
mode settled - by him at his own discretion and 
choice, within the legal requirements, and secondly 
that the interests of the community should be 
advanced, by the grant of such liberty to individual 
citizens, and that every action which tends to interfere 

W.P No.34660 of 2020 
 
 
11
with that liberty should be repressed, since it would be 
injurious to the interests of the State.” 
 
5. There is no doubt that the right concerns and protects an 
economic life of a citizen and the right to engage in any 
profession or occupation or trade or business. These are 
different forms and sources of livelihood and thus this right 
is inextricably linked with the right of life and liberty 
guaranteed by Article 9 of the Constitution. This right will 
also have to be read with Article 38 of the Constitution (one 
of the principles of policy) which enjoins on the State 
amongst others to provide for all citizens, within the 
available resources of the country, facilities for work and 
adequate livelihood with reasonable rest and leisure”. It is 
in this sense that the reasonable restrictions imposed by the 
State may also be construed by the courts so that a 
regulation which is confiscatory in nature may not impinge 
upon the positive obligation cast under Article 38 on the 
State. It was reiterated in Muhammad Yasin v. Federation 
of 
Pakistan 
through 
Secretary, 
Establish 
Division, 
Islamabad and others (PLD 2012 SC 132) that:  
“Article 18 and the rights guaranteed by it are 
concerned with the economic life of the nation and its 
citizens.” 
 
6. To quote Cornelius J., once again in East and West 
Steamship Co. case:  
“in unequivocal terms that every citizen shall have the 
right to conduct any lawful trade or business. In so 
doing, the Article merely furnishes a fresh and 
authoritative declaration of a pre-existing right under 
the common law.” 
7. In granting the right, Article 18 uses different expressions 
such as profession, occupation, trade or business but does 
not define them. However, these are all general terms and 
as will be seen they run into each other. It will not be 
required in this case to engage in the nuanced debate as 
whether the petitioners conduct trade or business or carry 
on an occupation. For, the petitioners do not quarrel that 
they run the schools as an occupation and while doing so 
conduct a business too.” 
 
15. The 1950 Act would suffice as one of the qualifications 
prescribed by law which empowers the Federal Government 
to prescribe qualifications in respect of lawful trade 
regarding import of books and journals from India.  The 
reply which has been set out above on behalf of respondent 
No.3 alludes to the spirit of national interest which was 
invoked to ban import of goods from India.  It has been 
misconstrued in the reply that the issue relates to the import 
of books and journals from India which are exclusively of 
Indian origin and which will impinge upon the national 

W.P No.34660 of 2020 
 
 
12
policy or impact the national interest.  The primary question 
raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner is that there 
are Indian reprints and foreign books being printed in India 
(by foreign publishers) which are considerably cheaper to 
import as compared to the counties of their origin which 
would entail higher prices given the exchange rate prevalent 
at current times.  There is no doubt, therefore, that in certain 
cases the Federal Government may refuse the import of 
books from India which contain contents which are injurious 
to the national interest and regarding which the Courts will 
be loathe to interfere as such matters will be outside the 
domain of the Courts to judge whether the action is 
legitimate or not.  With regard to certain other books and 
journals which carry no such connotation and do not have an 
adverse impact on the national interest, the decision may be 
made by the Federal Government in a given case to allow 
the import of such books.  For instance, books which are 
purely research material or precedents of courts having legal 
and academic value to lawyers and judges as well as 
academic bodies in Pakistan may be allowed to be imported. 
These will have no consequent ramifications regarding 
national interest and will not jeopardise the interest of the 
country in any manner.  In short, this is a matter which 
ought to be decided on a case to case basis and cannot be 
determined generally by use of the powers to impose a 
complete ban without regard to individual cases.  For 
instance, the petitioners in these cases may, if the 
circumstances were right, apply to the Federal Government 
for import of specific books regarding which an analysis 

W.P No.34660 of 2020 
 
 
13
may be carried out by the Federal Government and upon 
such analysis may conclude that such books have no adverse 
bearing on the national security or interest of the country 
and may be allowed to be imported.  Such discretion should 
continue to be retained by the Federal Government.   
16. A reading of section 3 of the 1950 Act holistically and 
in the entire context of the law would also lead to the 
inference that it is intended that the Federal Government 
retain its power to decide upon the prohibitions and 
restrictions or otherwise to control the import and export of 
goods in individual cases coming up before it and for which 
a procedure may be prescribed by rules.  Sub-section (1) of 
section 3 also prescribes that further appeals may be 
provided and applications for review or revision should also 
be prescribed through the rules.  Surely, sub-section (2) 
prohibits the import of goods except in accordance with the 
conditions of a license to be issued by the Chief Controller.  
The intention to be gathered from a reading of section 3 
leads to the ineluctable conclusion that a complete 
prohibition of import of goods would be an infringement of 
rights guaranteed by Article 18 of the Constitution.  The 
Federal Government is merely empowered to regulate the 
trade or profession by a specific system which is envisaged 
under sub-section (2) of section 3 of the 1950 Act.  It could 
be a condition of the license that certain goods will not be 
imported or the license may provide for import of certain 
other goods which are not injurious to the national interest 
such as books and journals relating to legal profession and 
which are not even of the Indian origin but are merely Indian 

W.P No.34660 of 2020 
 
 
14
reprints of foreign books and published by publishing 
houses based in India. 
17. Learned counsel for the petitioners also relied upon 
Article 19 of the Constitution which provides that: 
“19. Every citizen shall have the right to freedom of speech 
and expression, and there shall be freedom of the press, 
subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by law in the 
interest of the glory of Islam or the integrity, security or 
defence of Pakistan or any part thereof, friendly relations 
with foreign States, public order, decency or morality, or in 
relation to contempt of court, 1 [commission of] or 
incitement to an offence.” 
 
18. The right guaranteed by Article 19 is inextricably 
linked to and dependent upon the right to read and receive 
information.  Only then is it possible for the right to freedom 
of speech to be exercised in a wholesome manner.  Thus 
there must be sovereignty of choice to vest in a reader to sift 
through different sources of material of literary value which 
will, in turn, equip him or her with knowledge so that the 
cherished right to freedom of speech and expression can be 
enjoyed.  It will be noted that the right is subject to 
reasonable restrictions imposed by law, amongst others, in 
the interest of friendly relations with foreign states.  This 
will include restrictions to be imposed if the relations with a 
foreign state do not remain so friendly.  
19. In a recent judgment by this Court the right guaranteed 
by Article 19 has been elaborated in the following terms: 
“…This is distinct from Article 19 where the legislature 
cannot make just any law to restrict and constrain that right 
but can only do so “in the interest of the glory of Islam or 
the integrity, security or defence of Pakistan or any part 
thereof, friendly relations with foreign states, public order, 
decency or morality or in relation to contempt of court, 
commission of or incitement to an offence”. Thus the power 
to restrict free speech and freedom of press is 
circumscribed and hedged in by the fields of legislation 
specifically mentioned in Article 19 itself. Any law which 
seeks to suppress freedom of speech and press and does not 

W.P No.34660 of 2020 
 
 
15
falls strictly within one of the exceptions in Article 19, falls 
afoul of it and is ultra vires to that extent.  
 
56. 
The first part of article 19 confers rights to freedom 
of speech and expression on every citizen. It further goes on 
to say that “there shall be freedom of the press”. This is a 
call by the Constitution on Federal and Provincial 
Governments to ensure the freedom of the press. The 
obligation thus placed is merely an extension of the original 
and primary right to free speech which has come to inhere 
in a citizen.  The whole purpose of providing for freedom of 
press is to enable democracy to flourish by keeping the 
citizenry informed and which will, in turn, feed into the 
entire democratic process through the right to vote.  Thus 
both, right to freedom of speech and freedom of press are 
inextricably linked to each to form a whole and constitute 
the main planks on which the edifice of democracy rests.  
To what purpose is the freedom of speech if the press is not 
free. Conversely, to what purpose is the freedom of press if 
the citizens are not free to speak.  An abridgment of any of 
these rights is abridgment of liberty and constitutional 
values.  It is the curtailment of natural rights.  For, without 
a free press, citizens will not be able to gather information 
to make informed decisions and to raise their voices against 
tyranny,  nepotism,   corruption etc. and other vices of like 
nature which the Governments are engaged in. Although 
freedom of press has been secured by the Constitution, it 
has been done for the benefit of citizens and to bolster their 
ability to participate fully and effectively in democratic 
process. It is not a right conferred independently on the 
press and media but is a necessary concomitant of the right 
to freedom of speech. The Constitution makers did not 
merely provide a right to freedom of speech and expression 
but added a further condition that the press shall be free so 
that the flow and transmission of information to the citizens 
may not be censored. Thomas Carlyle in ‘On Heroes and 
Hero-Worship (1841) quoted Edmund Burke, who said that 
“there were Three Estates in   Parliament; but in the 
Reporters Gallery yonder there sat a Fourth Estate more 
important far than they all.  It is not a figure of speech or 
witty saying; it is a literal fact—very momentous to us in 
these lines.”   Without it the right cannot be enjoyed to its 
fullest extent and would remain truncated. Information and 
ideas feed into the decision making process while enriching 
the mental faculties. This, in turn strengthens the 
democratic polity and nurtures good governance.  
 
57. 
As if the enumeration in Article 19 was not enough, 
the right has been reinforced by the introduction of Article 
19A through Constitution (Eighteenth Amendment) Act, 
2010 and provides that: 
“19A. Every citizen shall have the right to have 
access to information in all matters of public 
importance subject to regulation and reasonable 
restrictions imposed by law.” 
58. 
Article 19 and 19A have to be read together to form 
a seemless web. Right to freedom of speech is incomplete 
without freedom of press and which in turn, secures the 
right to have access to information in all matters of public 
importance. The Constitution guaranteed freedom of speech 
by Article 19 and lest its significance be lost, enacted 

W.P No.34660 of 2020 
 
 
16
Article 19A to confer a right to have access to information 
in all matters of public importance.  It is incredulous to 
conceive that the constitutional mandate of free speech and 
freedom of press would still remain subservient to a 
colonial law enacted for a specific purpose to stifle speech.  
The law was meant to place limits so that the primary 
purposes of servility and subjugation were achieved.  The 
purpose of law then, is an affront to constitutional rights 
now conferred.  Freedom from colonial rule was meant to 
usher in freedom of thought and it is impermissible for the 
citizens of Pakistan to be vilified and persecuted by 
allowing Section 124-A to remain part of our legal system.  
These provisions in the Constitution are woven into a 
unified fabric and make a code unto itself. S.124-A seriously 
dents the right to publish freely by the press and to impart 
information through different platforms used by media. Any 
writings on political issues or discourse on matters of 
public importance may be caught by the mischief  of S.124-
A and would have the unpalatable effect of inhibiting free 
press.” 
 
20. However, in my opinion, the right enshrined in Article 
19 and in particular the contention regarding free trade in 
ideas is too wide a proposition to be considered in the 
peculiar circumstances of the present cases where the stance 
of the Federal Government is that a general ban on import of 
goods from India has been imposed and this is a policy 
decision taken by the Federal Government based on the 
circumstances which existed between the two countries and 
with regard to which this Court is not qualified to render an 
opinion.  It is quintessentially a foreign policy issue and 
therefore this Court will not substitute its own opinion for 
that of the Federal Cabinet which reflects the decision of the 
Federal Government.  There is, however, no cavil that the 
right regarding promotion of free trade in ideas and the right 
to hold opinions and receive ideas is of international 
recognition.  Particularly, this is contained in Article 19 of 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which states 
that: 
“Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions 

W.P No.34660 of 2020 
 
 
17
without interference and to seek, receive and impart 
information and ideas through any media and regardless of 
frontiers.” 
 
21. It is also undisputed that in the current scheme of 
things, social media is a cross-border phenomenon and 
cannot be controlled or regulated by the governments. This 
has enabled peoples of different countries to have access to 
free speech and press which include freedom of circulation.  
They also have access to ideas on the internet and are able to 
read materials on these platforms which may not be 
available in printed form.  Books and other material and law 
journals are available online which can be accessed by 
persons sitting in their homes.  Libraries can also be 
accessed for purposes of research and comparative analysis 
on different views of legal jurisprudence and interpretation.  
Superior courts routinely cite not only Pakistani precedents 
but also Indian cases reported in Indian journals and 
renowned Indian treaties are frequently relied upon and 
discussed apart from foreign precedents from the U.S 
Supreme Court as well UK Supreme Court.  If the courts 
rely upon such precedents without any regard for prohibition 
on the import of books and journals from India, it is a 
contradiction in terms that the Federal Government has 
imposed a prohibition on said material which in actuality 
does not amount to prohibition at all while all of these books 
and journals are available online and can be accessed from 
multitude of sources. Yet that does not imply that the 
prohibition has placed a restriction on free trade in ideas and 
has left a gaping void which cannot be filled from other 
sources. A prohibition on import of law books and journals 

W.P No.34660 of 2020 
 
 
18
from India will have negligible effect on free trade in ideas. 
But the right to read and acquire knowledge will be 
seriously dented by the prohibition in that sources of 
knowledge will either be unavailable or atrociously 
expensive to acquire.  
Right to Read: 
22. In the Islamic tradition Iqra, the first revelation was an 
exhortation to read. In our constitution, this can be culled 
out of the right to life, Article 9, and 25-A which enjoins the 
state to provide free and compulsory education to all 
children of the age of five to sixteen years. More importantly 
it is an essential and concomitant attribute of the dignity of a 
man which is inviolable in terms of Article 14 of the 
Constitution. Dignity of a man can attain its full potential by 
acquiring education and knowledge and which, in turn, 
entirely depends upon the freedom to read books and 
journals as part of basic facilities that a person born in a free 
country is entitled to enjoy. Power to control the import or 
export of books can be a potent and powerful weapon in the 
hands of the executive for indoctrinating the highly 
receptive and sensitive minds of young people and to stifle 
the growth and development of free thought so essential for 
maintenance of democratic way of life and to enjoy 
constitutional rights. Great writer and thinker Voltaire said: 
“I may disapprove of what you say, but I will defend 
to the death your right to say it.” 
23. 
Socrates said that ‘the unexamined life is not worth 
living’.  Life can only be examined and taken to its full bloom 
by reading, for ‘a little learning is a dangerous things’. 
Reading prepares the mind to engage in animated discussions 

W.P No.34660 of 2020 
 
 
19
and to trade opinions with disparate and wide range of 
sources. Right to read is also included in the right to freedom 
of speech. Justice Douglas (U.S Supreme Court) speaking for 
the majority in Griswold v Connecticut, 381 U.S 479 (1965) at 
482, stated that: 
“The right of freedom of speech and press includes not only 
the right to utter or to print, but the right to distribute, the 
right to receive, the right to read.” 
 
Eleanor Roosevelt once said: 
“it is not only important but mentally invigorating to discuss 
political matters with people whose opinions differ radically 
from one’s own …. This is an invaluable check on one’s 
own ideas …. If we are to cope intelligently with a changing 
word, we must be flexible and willing to relinquish opinions 
that no longer have any bearing on existing conditions.”  
 
24. 
Reply of the Federal Government is premised on 
patriotism and national security. But ‘patriotism is the virtue 
of the vicious’ (Oscar Wilde). Lord Walker in A V. Secretary 
of State (2004) UKHL 56, put it somewhat differently, 
‘patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel, national 
security can be the last refuge of the tyrant’. And in the 
context of books and journals used to seek truth, ‘allowing the 
government to supervise the search for truth is like appointing 
the fox to guard the chicken coop’. (Yuval Noah Harari). 
25. 
To allow books and journals to be imported will not 
endanger national security nor will it imperil the political 
system. Both are common law countries having similarities in 
the system of administration of justice. They have 
constitutions with the same template and architecture based on 
parliamentary form of government. Indubitably, the law books 
and journals will enrich and widen  the horizon of the 
intellectual pursuits of lawyers, judges and academics alike. 
The prohibition has not deterred courts in Pakistan from using 

W.P No.34660 of 2020 
 
 
20
and relying upon case law from India nor has their value been 
diminished thereby. To what avail is the prohibition placed by 
the impugned notification if the import of books and law 
journals as well as other literary material takes place 
unimpeded and with impunity. This is being done from other 
sources and through different routes and so the prohibition is 
ineffective for all intents which makes it a mockery of the 
whole exercise of issuing a notification which has no effective 
applicability. The alternate sources consist of social media 
platforms and websites which contain such material which can 
easily be downloaded free of cost or upon payment online. 
Thus there is no intelligible basis for prohibiting the import of 
law books and journal if that prohibition can be easily evaded. 
It simply puts a premium on the original cost. We must bear in 
mind that the current phenomenon of social media is the new 
melting pot of ideas and the flow of information through that 
medium cannot be prohibited.  
26. 
Reading makes a man perfect. It opens new vistas and 
liberates the mind. Any prohibition on the pursuit of 
intellectual liberty and on the concept of objective truth 
threatens in the long run every department of thought. 
Reading not only enables free thought but, in turn empowers 
free speech which is the cornerstone of liberty as enshrined in 
the Constitution.  That is how a connection is established 
between reading and life and liberty (Article 9) so that right to 
read must be deemed comprised in the right to life and liberty 
as a penumbra of that right. Porter Stewert, a US Supreme 
Court justice once observed: 
“I should suppose that the hallmark of a truly effective 
security state would be the maximum public disclosure, 

W.P No.34660 of 2020 
 
 
21
recognizing that secrecy can best be preserved only when 
credibility is truly maintained.” 
 
27. 
Reading is essential for education and according to 
Will Durant, Philosopher and Historian, ‘education is the 
transmission of the knowledge and knowledge is power.’ 
28. 
The virtues of reading have been brought forth in the 
final essay ‘How one should read a book’ of V. Woolf’s book 
‘The Second Common Reader’ in these words: 
‘I have sometimes dreamt, at least, that when the day of 
judgment dawns and the great conquerors or lawyers or 
statement come to receive their rewards— their crowns, 
their laurels, their names carved  indelibly upon 
imperishable marble—the Almighty will turn to Pater and 
will say,  not without a certain envy when he sees us coming 
with our books under our arms “look, these need no 
rewards.  We have nothing to give them here.  They have 
loved reading”.  Since right of reading has been held to be 
a fundamental right, it cannot be taken away completely by 
enactment of a law.  It can only be regulated and the 
discretion vesting in the Federal Government must be 
structured to obviate any irrationality to creep into the 
whole process. 
 
Political Question and Foreign Affairs: 
 
“I hope that an understanding of the nature of our 
current engagement with foreign matters will persuade the 
reader that the best way to preserve American constitutional 
values is to meet the challenges that the world, as reflected in 
concrete cases on our docket, actually presents.  Doing so 
necessarily requires greater, not less, awareness of what is 
happening around us.” 
(Justice Stephen Breyer in his book ‘The Court and the 
World’) 
29. 
The Constitution vests the war power and the foreign 
affairs power in the executive branch.  In a word, it delegates 
to the elected branches responsibility for our security and not 
to the judiciary.  So what happens when security and civil 
liberties collide? Can the Courts rebalance the imperatives of 

W.P No.34660 of 2020 
 
 
22
security and decide on what the right balance is? The Courts 
have generally tended in the direction of deference. 
30. 
Two thousand years ago, Cicero (a Roman Senator) 
wrote, “when the cannons roar, the laws fall silent.”  This 
would eventually become one of the best-known legal 
principles concerning the role of Courts during wartime.  
Cicero set forth the doctrine of political question.  It provides 
a technical basis for courts to refuse to consider the lawfulness 
of executive action taken pursuant to either its wartime or 
foreign affairs powers.  “The doctrine says that in certain 
instances, the Constitution gives not to the courts but to other 
branches of government the power to decide whether an 
action violates the Constitution.  In this way, the laws, 
including the Constitution, do not necessarily fall silent.  They 
still apply to the government action in question.  But it is for 
the Congress or the President, not the Courts, to determine 
what the law requires gives the national security threat.”   
 
(Justice Stephen Breyer in ‘The Court and the World). 
31. 
 In my opinion, the question involved in these petitions 
is a political question and touches upon national security and 
foreign affairs matters.  The political branches of the 
government should have unfettered power over such matters.  
This Court cannot sit in judgment over the decision-making of 
the Executive which is equipped with reports and relevant 
information to make the final decision.  It would not be 
appropriate to rebalance the imperatives of the decision in 
order to come to a different conclusion.  At best, this Court 
can ask the Executive to review its decision in respect of law 
books and journals.  A matter which entails foreign policy 

W.P No.34660 of 2020 
 
 
23
implications must reside with the political branches including 
the power to review. 
32. 
Justice Robert H. Jackson (U.S Supreme Court) wrote 
in Chicago & Southern Airlines, Inc. v Waterman S.S. Corp., 
333 U.S 103 (1948) that: 
“…But even if courts could require full disclosure, the very 
nature of executive decisions as to foreign policy is 
political, not judicial.  Such decisions are wholly confided 
by our Constitution to the political departments of the 
government, Executive and Legislative.  They are delicate, 
complex, and involve large elements of prophecy.  They are 
and should be undertaken only by those directly responsible 
to the people whose welfare they advance or imperil.  They 
are decisions of a kind for which the Judiciary has neither 
aptitude, facilities nor responsibility and have long been 
held to belong in the domain of political power not subject 
to judicial intrusion or inquiry.  We therefore agree that 
whatever of this order emanates from the President is not 
susceptible of review by the Judicial Department.” 
 
33. 
Though it would be a far-fetched idea to permit courts 
to assert their policy preferences in matters of foreign affairs 
and national security, the courts nevertheless owe a duty to 
preserve individual liberties.  This owes much to the changing 
nature of the world.  In an intensely interdependent world 
facing global threats that are likely to last a generation or 
more, special security needs are no longer as intermittent or 
short-lived as they once were.  In such circumstances, for the 
courts to avoid constitutional questions for security reasons is 
to concede to the Executive as a matter of course the 
extraordinary powers it was intended to wield only under 
extreme conditions. 
34. 
In this case, matters of commerce and trade between 
two countries are engaged.  This is, essentially and properly, a 
decision in the realm of diplomacy and foreign affairs.  The 
decision has its source in the ebbing of relations between the 
two countries.  There cannot be export of goods if India does 

W.P No.34660 of 2020 
 
 
24
not permit that to happen, which is presumably the case.  
Conversely, whether to allow import of goods would be a 
delicate question and one in the expertise of different 
departments of the Federal Government who can assess the 
damage to domestic traders and business if unilateral imports 
were allowed.  The right to free trade in ideas needs to be 
balanced against right of trade, business and profession 
locally.  Yet, a case can clearly be made out for import of 
Indian reprints of foreign books for which no parallel market 
exists in Pakistan.  Hence the need for establishing forums to 
review and decide upon individual cases seeking variation in 
the Import Policy. 
35. 
It has long been settled that a question relating to 
foreign affairs and national security is par excellence a non-
justiciable question.  “Issues of national security do not fall 
beyond the competence of the courts…It is, however, self-
evidently right that national courts must give great weight to 
the views of the executive on matters of national security”.  
(SSHD v Rehman [2001] UKHL 47) (held by the UK Supreme 
Court).  Courts have accorded a substantial degree of 
deference to the expertise of agencies in assessing the risk to 
national security and in weighing it against countervailing 
interests.  This is being done for two reasons; The first is, 
institutional competence and the second is, democratic 
legitimacy of the executive (See e.g R (National Council for 
Civil Liberties) v SSHD [2019] EWHC 2057 (Admin); R 
(Miranda) v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 6) 
 
 

W.P No.34660 of 2020 
 
 
25
Discretion: 
36. 
It is true that power to issue orders under Section 3(1) 
of the 1950 Act is not absolute and it has to be exercised in a 
structured manner according to the rules of reason and justice, 
not according to private opinion.  It cannot be arbitrary, vague 
and fanciful.  But the right question to ask is whether the 
discretion was exercised on purely trading and commercial 
considerations or had a predominantly national security and 
foreign affairs / diplomatic relations feature to it.  The reply 
makes it evident that the decision-making was largely 
influenced by the latter and so the discretion so exercised 
cannot be reviewed in the narrow prism of rationality and 
impropriety.  In the assessment of proportionality in this case, 
conventional rules will not apply and appropriate weight is 
due to the experience and opinion of agencies, based on 
sensitive intelligence information.   
Conclusion: 
37. 
In conclusion, it is held that: 
a) The impugned SRO and Para are not per se, 
unconstitutional and have been issued validly; 
b) Right to read is a fundamental right and is enshrined in 
the Constitution; 
c) Federal Government is directed to appoint an officer to 
hear review / revision of the impugned Para generally 
and of the petitioners particularly in respect of law 
books and journals. The recommendations of the 
Officer so appointed shall then be considered and 
decided upon by the Federal Government. 
d) The Officer shall be appointed within the next two 
months by the Commerce Division of Ministry of 
Commerce and Textile, Government of Pakistan and 
posted on its website.  The petitioners may, if so 
advised, file a review thereafter. 

W.P No.34660 of 2020 
 
 
26
e) The Federal Government shall also issue instructions 
regarding the filing of review petitions by private 
persons. 
These petitions are disposed of in the above terms.
