“Corruption is a cancer, a cancer that eats away at the citizen’s faith in 
democracy, diminishes the instinct for innovation and creativity.”1 
Therefore, integrity, transparency, and the fight against corruption must 
be part of the culture and taught as fundamental values.2 
 
 
 
Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J.– The Petitioner serves as Girdawar in 
Mauza Shahdara, Lahore. Respondent No.2 claims that he paid him 
Rs.3,500,000/- through cheques in instalments of Rs.500,000/- each as a 
bribe for the mutation of 182 kanals of land situated in that Mauza. 
According to him, the Petitioner did not get the job done, and when he asked 
him to return his money, he issued him Cheque No.D-15380129 dated 
22.5.2021 for Rs.2,000,000/- towards partial reimbursement. The cheque 
was dishonoured on presentation after which Respondent No.2 lodged FIR 
No. 2477/2022 dated 13.5.2022 against the Petitioner at Police Station 
Shahdara, Lahore, for an offence under section 489-F PPC. The Petitioner

seeks the quashing of that FIR through this petition under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”). 
2. 
 
The Petitioner denies having received any bribe from 
Respondent No.2 and also that he gave him Cheque No. D-15380129 to 
partially return that sum. He claims it was a different transaction regarding 
which civil litigation is pending. In this petition, his plea is that Respondent 
No.2 could not, on the stated facts, lodge the FIR against him. The alleged 
agreement between the parties being void, the consideration for Cheque No. 
D-15380129 is unlawful and against public policy. 
3. 
 
The Additional Advocate General has opposed this petition. He 
contends that the transaction between the Petitioner and Respondent No.2 
has two severable parts.  The first is illegal, but the second is not. Hence, the 
Petitioner can be prosecuted under section 489-F PPC for dishonestly giving 
a bad cheque. 
The law and jurisprudence 
4. 
 
Illegality as a defence stems from two Latin maxims ex turpi 
causa non oritur octio (“no action arises from a disgraceful cause”) and 
in pari delicto potior est conditio defendentis (“where both parties are 
equally in the wrong the position of the defendant is the stronger”). There is 
also the principle of locus poenitentiae (“an opportunity to repent”) and the 
“reliance rule”. According to the latter, illegality is a defence where the 
claimant has to rely on the illegality to establish or to plead the cause of 
action.3 In Holman v. Johnson, (1755) 1 Cowp 342 at 343, Lord Mansfield 
CJ stated: 
“No court will lend its aid to a man who founds his cause of action upon 
an immoral or an illegal act. If, from the plaintiff’s own stating or 
otherwise, the cause of action appears to arise ex turpi causa, or the 
transgression of a positive law of this country, there the court says he has 
no right to be assisted. It is upon that ground the court goes; not for the 
sake of the defendant, but because they will not lend their aid to such a 
plaintiff. So, if the plaintiff and defendant were to change sides, and the 
defendant was to bring his action against the plaintiff, the latter would 
then have the advantage of it; for where both are equally in fault, potior 
est conditio defendentis.”

Lord Mansfield did not elucidate what an “immoral” or an 
“illegal” act was. This resulted in an “incoherent mass of inconsistent 
authorities”4 and produced “arbitrary, unjust, and disproportionately harsh”5 
outcomes. Finally, in Patel v. Mirza, [2016] UKSC 42, [2016] 1 W.L.R. 
399], a case heard by a panel of nine Justices, the U.K. Supreme Court 
abandoned the conventional rules and adopted “a policy-based” or “range of 
factors approach.”6 In his leading judgment, Lord Toulson, with whom Lady 
Hale, Lord Kerr, Lord Wilson, and Lord Hodge agreed (as did Lord 
Neuberger albeit with some differences) explained: 
“[O]ne cannot judge whether allowing a claim which is in some way 
tainted by illegality would be contrary to the public interest, because it 
would be harmful to the integrity of the legal system, without (a) 
considering the underlying purpose of the prohibition which has been 
transgressed, (b) considering conversely any other relevant public policies 
which may be rendered ineffective or less effective by denial of the claim, 
and (c) keeping in mind the possibility of overkill unless the law is applied 
with a due sense of proportionality … That trio of necessary 
considerations can be found in the case law.” 
6. 
 
On the other hand, Lords Sumption, Mance, and Clarke 
favoured preserving the existing norms. They apprehended that the new 
approach would create unacceptable uncertainty. 
7. 
 
The courts in India and Pakistan decide the restitution claims on 
the basis of the Contract Act of 1872 which they have commonly inherited 
from the British. The statutory provisions in both countries are the same 
except for a few amendments they have made to meet their domestic 
requirements. Section 23 of the Act describes what considerations and 
objects are lawful. Section 24 provides that the agreement is void if any part 
of a single one or any part of several considerations for a single object is 
unlawful. Section 65 states, “when an agreement is discovered to be void or 
when a contract becomes void, any person who has received any advantage 
under such agreement or contract is bound to restore it, or to make 
compensation for it, to the person from whom he received it.” 
8. 
 
Section 84 of the Trust Act 1882 is also relevant to the 
discourse. It provides that if the owner of a property transfers it to another 
                                          
4 Bilta (UK) Ltd. (in liquidation) and others v. Nazir and others (No.2), [2015] UKSC 23, per Lord 
Sumption.

for an illegal purpose but that purpose is not carried out,  the transferee must 
hold the property for the benefit of the transferor. The same rule will apply 
where the transferor is not as guilty as the transferee, or allowing the 
transferee to retain the property would defeat the provisions of any law. 
9. 
 
The defence of illegality is sometimes also pleaded in criminal 
cases. In India, jurisprudence in this regard has mostly developed on section 
138 of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (the “NIA”), which 
allows criminal prosecution for the dishonour of cheques.7 In the context of 
bribery, there are two streams of decisions. Some courts have accepted the 
plea while others have not. 
10. 
 
In Virender Singh v. Laxmi Narain and another [1 (2007) BC 
530, 2007 Cri LJ 2262]8, the petitioner received illegal gratification from the 
respondent-complainant for arranging a job for his nephew in Haryana 
Police through high-profile political leaders. He failed to fulfil his promise 
and issued a cheque to return the money which was dishonoured for want of 
sufficient funds. The complainant filed a complaint under section 138 of the 
NIA in which the petitioner was convicted. The Delhi High Court acquitted 
him holding as under: 
                                          
7 Section 138 of India’s Negotiable Instruments Act, 1861, reads as under: 
S.138. 
Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account.– Where any 
cheque drawn by a person on an account maintained by him with a banker for payment of any 
amount of money to another person from out of that account for the discharge, in whole or in part, 
of any debt or other liability, is returned by the bank unpaid, either because of the amount of 
money standing to the credit of that account is insufficient to honour the cheque or that it exceeds 
the amount arranged to be paid from that account by an agreement made with that bank, such 
person shall be deemed to have committed an offence and shall, without prejudice to any other 
provision of this Act, be punished with imprisonment for a term which may be extended to two 
years, or with fine which may extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or with both: 
Provided that nothing contained in this section shall apply unless– 
(a) 
the cheque has been presented to the bank within a period of six months from 
the date on which it is drawn or within the period of its validity, whichever is 
earlier; 
(b) 
the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque, as the case may be, makes a 
demand for the payment of the said amount of money by giving a notice in 
writing to the drawer of the cheque within thirty days of the receipt of 
information by him from the bank regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid; 
and 
(c) 
the drawer of such cheque fails to make the payment of the said amount of 
money to the payee or, as the case may be, to the holder in due course of the 
cheque within fifteen days of the receipt of the said notice. 
Explanation.– For the purposes of this section, “debt or other liability” means a legally 
enforceable debt or other liability.

“[T]he explanation in section 138 of the [NIA] makes it clear that the 
expression ‘debt or other liability’ has reference only to a legally 
enforceable debt or liability. Conversely, if a cheque is issued in respect of 
a debt or liability which is not legally enforceable, then section 138 of the 
said Act would not apply. Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, 
inter alia, stipulates that every agreement of which the object or 
consideration is unlawful is void.” 
11. 
 
In Virender Singh, the Delhi High Court noticed Illustration (f) 
to section 23 of the Contract Act, which is as follows: “A promises to obtain 
for B an employment in the public service, and B promises to pay 1000 
rupees to A. The agreement is void, as the consideration for it is unlawful.” 
Taking Illustration (f) further, the Court considered the following questions: 
If B pays the promised sum of 1000 rupees to A, but the latter does not fulfil 
his promise of obtaining employment for B in public service, does B have a 
remedy in law to seek restitution and return of his money? And next, what is 
the obligation of a person who has received advantage under a void 
agreement? Is A bound to return 1,000 rupees to B? To answer these 
questions, the Court considered section 65 of the Contract Act and ruled that 
this provision does not apply where the parties are aware of the illegality at 
the time of execution of the agreement, and it is void ab initio. Resultantly, 
the money in the example given above is not recoverable. The High Court 
stated: 
“[Section 65 of the Contract Act] applies to (1) an agreement which is 
“discovered to be void” or (2) a contract which “becomes void”. The 
expressions “agreement” and “contract” have distinct meanings under the 
Contract Act. As mentioned earlier, an “agreement” becomes a “contract” 
only if it is enforceable in law. Thus, the phrase “a contract becomes void” 
appearing in the said Section 65 would not have any application in the 
case where an agreement is void ab initio. It has already been indicated 
above that the agreement in the present case was void from the very 
beginning. Therefore, the agreement in question, as also the agreement of 
the type mentioned in Illustration (f) to the said Section 23, cannot fall 
within the phrase “a contract becomes void.” This leaves us with 
agreements which are “discovered to be void.” This has reference to those 
agreements which, the contracting parties or one of them did not know, at 
the time of entering into the agreement, that the same was not enforceable 
in law, but it was later “discovered” by them or one of them as being void. 
Where the parties are aware and have knowledge that the agreement is 
unlawful and despite this knowledge they go ahead with the agreement, 
they would not be able to take recourse to the provisions of the said 
Section 65 because there would be no “discovery” of the invalidity of the 
agreement. That the agreement was unlawful and, therefore, void, was 
known to them all along.”

In R. Parimala Bai v. Bhaskar Narasimhaiah,9 the accused 
assured the complainant that he could secure a job for his son in a particular 
factory and received Rs.10,00,000/- for that purpose. However, he failed and 
gave the complainant a cheque to return the money which was dishonoured. 
The Karnataka High Court quashed the complaint under section 138 of the 
NIA holding as under: 
“Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act mandates that [a legally 
recoverable debt should exist]. To attract section 138 of the Negotiable 
Instruments Act, the party has to plead with regard to the existence of a 
legally recoverable debt. If he pleads with regard to the existence of the 
legally recoverable debt under section 138 of the Act, then only 
presumption under section 139 of the Act can be raised in favour of the 
complainant. If the complainant himself does not plead the existence of a 
legally recoverable debt, then there is no question of raising any initial 
presumption in favour of the complainant.” 
13. 
 
In Nagaraj alias Nagappa Karennavar v. Basalingayya 
Hiremath (2022 Latest Case Law 2529 Kant)10, on similar facts, the 
Karnataka High Court quashed the proceedings on a complaint under section 
138 of the NIA. It held that the provisions of section 23 of the Contract Act 
are “crystal clear.” If a contract is void, particularly where the consideration 
is immoral, illegal or contrary to public policy, the entire transaction is 
rendered void. The consideration paid in such a contract becomes an 
unlawful consideration. As a result, the money for which the cheque is 
drawn cannot be called a legally recoverable debt. 
14. 
 
Let’s now look at the other set of cases. In E.K. Saseendra 
Varma Raj v. State of Kerala and another [2009 (5) R.C.R (criminal) 
267]11, the petitioner issued two cheques to refund the money he received for 
arranging a job for the complainant’s son which bounced. In a private 
complaint, he was convicted for an offence under section 138 of the NIA. 
The Kerala High Court upheld his conviction while exercising revisional 
jurisdiction. The learned Judge nixed the contention that the accused and the 
complainant were in pari delicto. He reasoned: 
“This is not a case where the original agreement entered into between the 
complainant and the accused is sought to be enforced … But here the 
accused after taking a sum of Rs. 75,000/- was unable to secure the 
employment to the complainant as promised by him in an aided high

school where the teachers are not government servants and where the 
service is not public service. Thereupon the complainant demanded the 
money back, and the accused agreed to return the money. This agreement 
to return the money was not in any way tainted by any illegality. The 
accused was really agreeing to disgorge his ill-gotten gains. It is only an 
act of undoing an illegality by another agreement, the consideration for 
which was not illegal or opposed to public policy. The cheques executed 
by the revision petitioner/accused in pursuance of the agreement to return 
the money received by him, were thus drawn for the discharge of a legally 
enforceable debt or liability.” 
15. 
 
In R.L. Sahu v. Moh Tahir Shekh [2012 (3) MPHT (C.G.) 69; 
2012 ACD 981; 2012 (118) AIC 882], the respondent received money from 
the petitioner to get a job for him but failed. The petitioner demanded his 
money back upon which the respondent gave him two cheques which were 
dishonoured. The petitioner filed a complaint under section 138 of the NIA. 
The trial court dismissed it on the ground that the cheques in question were 
not for the payment of a legally enforceable debt or liability. The Chattisgarh 
High Court set aside that order stating: 
“In the present case, first part of the agreement was not illegal, but when 
the respondent, with a view to correct himself, has agreed to return the 
money which he had received from the petitioner for an illegal purpose 
and issued cheques in favour of the petitioner, who is victim of the first 
agreement, then it cannot be said that second part of the agreement is 
illegal and the petitioner is not entitled to take recourse available under the 
law for the wrong committed by the respondent. Therefore, petitioner 
cannot be denied access to justice. His position was not of pari delicto.” 
16. 
 
In Awadesh Tahkur and others v. State of Bihar and 
another,12 the complainant, an unemployed person, approached the 
petitioners who promised him a job abroad in exchange for Rs.150,000/-. 
Subsequently, the petitioners provided him a visa and an air ticket which 
was found forged. The Patna High Court refused to apply the pari delicto 
rule for two reasons: first, the petitioners had a higher level of bargaining 
power, and second, there was an allegation against them that they had forged 
the visa and air ticket. 
17. 
 
Analysis of the above case law shows that in India there is a 
preponderance of opinion that a complaint under section 138 of the NIA is 
not competent because the consideration therefor is unlawful, against public 
policy and dehors section 23 of the Contract Act. However, recently in

Prakash N. v. The State of Karnataka,13 the Karnataka High Court took a 
more pragmatic approach to the issue. In that case, the accused and the 
complainant struck a deal to secure employment for the latter’s son. The 
money exchanged was thus a bribe. The civil court had dismissed the suit for 
recovery of money on the ground that the agreement was against public 
policy and violated section 23 of the Contract Act. The High Court refused 
to quash the criminal proceedings and ruled that both the bribe-taker and the 
bribe-giver must be prosecuted. The following excerpt is quite instructive: 
“The petitioner [accused], by relying on the decision of the Delhi High 
Court, would contend that the agreement is contrary to section 23 of the 
Indian Contract Act, 1872 is not enforceable, and therefore the criminal 
proceedings cannot be initiated. Thereby, there is an admission on the part 
of the petitioner-accused that there is an agreement which is contrary to 
law and a violation of section 23 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. 
Therefore, leading to the inevitable conclusion that there is an illegal 
bargain which was entered into between the petitioner and respondent. If 
that is so, I am of the considered opinion that extraordinary powers under 
section 482 of Cr.P.C. cannot be exercised to quash the proceedings at this 
stage. The matter would require investigation as to who are involved in 
job scam and their respective roles etc. since prima facie there is an 
admission of an offence by both parties … In view of the said admission, 
it is clear that not only the bribe-taker but the bribe-giver would also have 
to be prosecuted.” 
18. 
 
In Pakistan, the issue under discussion was considered by B.Z. 
Kaikaus, J. in Malik Allah Ditta v. Malik Allah Wasaya (PLD 1956 Lahore 
521). The plaintiff claimed that he extended the defendant a loan of 
Rs.1500/- and he gave him a cheque which was dishonoured. He filed a suit 
for recovery of money based on that cheque. The defendant, an employee of 
a Municipal Committee, pleaded that the cheque was not by way of a loan 
but represented money received by the plaintiff benami for the defendant in 
consequence of an illegal transaction between the defendant and the 
Committee. The plaintiff argued that the defendant’s plea was founded on an 
illicit transaction and should be rejected outright. His Lordship held that the 
maxims, such as ex turpi causa non oritur octio, “are not rules of law and 
courts are not bound by them. They represent considerations of justice and 
public policy that may, in the circumstances of a case, be overridden by 
other similar considerations. Their applicability is always subject to what 
appears to the court to be the equities of a case ... The courts need not apply 
them if, in a particular case, their application would lead to injustice or to a

situation that public policy does not approve of.”  Following an earlier Full 
Bench judgment in Qadir Bakhsh v. Hakam (AIR 1932 Lahore 503), his 
Lordship ruled that the defendant could plead the real facts before the court. 
The case at hand 
19. 
 
The issue before this Court in the present proceedings is 
whether FIR No.2477/2022 should be quashed. The question as to whether a 
suit based on Cheque No.D-15380129 is maintainable or whether 
Respondent No.2 is otherwise entitled to recover Rs.2,000,000/- from the 
Petitioner is not before me. Therefore, I must avoid any comment on that 
aspect. 
20. 
 
As per contents of FIR No.2477/2022, Respondent No.2 gave 
Rs.3,500,000/- to the Petitioner as a bribe for the mutation of land. He failed 
to manage it and gave him Cheque No.D-15380129 for Rs.2,000,000/- to 
return the aforesaid amount partially. The Petitioner has his own story about 
the cheque. Therefore, a thorough investigation is required to determine the 
real facts. 
21. 
 
In Mst. Sughran Bibi v. The State (PLD 2018 SC 595), the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan held that FIR is essentially an “incident 
report” because it informs the police for the first time that an occurrence 
involving commission of a cognizable offence has taken place. Once the FIR 
is registered, the occurrence is regarded as a “case”, and every step taken in 
the ensuing investigation under sections 156, 157, and 159 Cr.P.C. is a step 
taken in that case. The contents of the FIR do not guide or govern the 
Investigating Officer, and he is not under any obligation to establish that 
version. Instead, he must find out the truth. He is required to collect 
information from any number of people who appear to be acquainted with 
the facts of the occurrence. Every new piece of information he obtains 
during the process or the discovery of a new circumstance relevant to the 
commission of the offence does not require the registration of a separate 
FIR. Such additional information or knowledge is part of the ongoing 
investigation into the same case, which began when the FIR was registered. 
22. 
 
I am aware that the courts quash the criminal proceedings when 
the allegations in the FIR or the complaint, taken at face value and accepted 

Writ Petition No. 72703/2022

in entirety, do not prima facie constitute an offence or make out a case 
against the accused. This principle cannot be applied to the present case. The 
Petitioner seeks quashing of the FIR rather than a private complaint. Even if 
his contention is accepted that Cheque No.D-15380129 is void because the 
consideration is unlawful and against public policy, an investigation is 
required to determine whether the crime of corruption has been committed. 
The State is interested in fighting corruption and prosecuting those who 
indulge in it. 
23. 
 
Pakistan Penal Code expressly recognizes that the bribe-giver is 
the collaborator of the bribe-taker. The Explanation to section 109 PPC 
states that “an act or offence is said to be committed in consequence of the 
abetment, when it is committed in consequence of the instigation, or in 
pursuance of the conspiracy, or with the aid which constitutes the abetment.” 
Illustration (a) to section 109 reads as follows: 
“(a) 
A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing A 
some favour in the exercise of B’s official functions. B accepts the bribe. 
A has abetted the offence defined in section 161.” 
24. 
 
In view of the fact that the bribe-giver is an accomplice of the 
bribe-taker, both are liable to be prosecuted. Hence, if the police determine 
following an investigation that the offence of bribery has been committed, 
proceedings shall also be initiated against Respondent No.2. 
25. 
 
Subject to the above observations, this petition is dismissed.
