Through this petition under Article 199 of 
the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973, petitioner Mohmad has questioned the 
legality and validity of impugned orders dated 
22.10.2021 and 27.10.2021 passed by the learned 
courts below. Through the former, Area Magistrate 
dismissed his application U/S 176 Cr.P.C. for 
disinterment of corpse of daughter of the petitioner 
namely Mst. Najma Bibi and through the latter 
Revisional Court dismissed revision against the 
said order on account of  maintainability.  
2. 
Brief facts necessary for disposal of this 
petition are that the petitioner being father of 
deceased Mst. Najma Bibi, filed an application 
U/S 176 Cr.P.C. before the Area Magistrate for 
disinterment of her corpus, inter-alia, on the 
grounds that she was done to death by his son in 
law namely Muhammad Irfan/ respondent No.4 
through administering some poisonous material, 
therefore, her post mortem after disinterment of 
corpse was essential to dig out the truth. The Area 
Magistrate after seeking report from the police 
vide impugned order dated 22.12.2021 dismissed 

W.P. No.70407/2021  
 
 
 
                        2 
 
the said application. Being aggrieved the petitioner 
filed revision petition before the Addl. Sessions 
Judge, which met with the same fate vide 
impugned order dated 27.10.2021 while observing 
that the order of Magistrate for declining 
disinterment of corpse was an administrative order, 
as such revision against such order did not lie. 
Hence, this writ petition.  
3. 
Heard. Revisonal Court has not decided the 
lis on merits rather declined intervention in the 
impugned order of Area Magistrate on the score 
that the same was not a judicial order rather 
administrative one, therefore, before discussing the 
merits of the case, it would be in the fitness of 
things to firstly settle this issue, as if in the end it is 
resolved that Magistrate’s order was judicial in 
nature, then discussing the merits of the case, 
would deprive either side from a judicial forum. In 
order to answer this question, we have to go 
through relevant provisions of Sections 174 & 176 
Cr.P.C. contained in Chapter XIV in Part V of the 
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. Section 174 of 
Cr.P.C. which reads as under:- 
174. Police to inquire on suicide, etc. (1) 
The officer incharge of a police-station or some other 
police-officer specially empowered by the Provincial 
Government in that behalf, on receiving information that a 
person:  
(a) has committed suicide, or  
(b) has been killed by another, or by an animal, or 
by machinery, or by an accident, or  
(c) has been died under circumstances raising a 
reasonable suspicion that some other person has 
committed an offence,  
shall immediately give intimation thereof to the nearest 
Magistrate empowered to hold inquests, and, unless 

W.P. No.70407/2021  
 
 
 
                        3 
 
otherwise directed by any rule prescribed by the Provincial 
Government, shall proceed to the place where the body of 
such deceased person is, and there, in the presence of two 
or more respectable inhabitants of the neighbourhood, shall 
make an investigation, and draw up a report of the apparent 
cause of death describing such wounds fractures, bruises 
and other marks of injury as may be found on the body, and 
stating in what manner, or by what weapon or instrument 
(if any), such marks appear to have been inflicted. 
2.-----

 4. 
Section 176 Cr.P.C.  which deals with the 
powers of Magistrate provides as under:- 
176. Inquiry by Magistrate into cause of 
death. (1) When any person dies while in the custody of 
the police, the nearest Magistrate empowered to hold 
inquests shall, and, in any other case mentioned in section 
174, clauses (a), (b) and ( c) of sub-section (1), any 
Magistrate so empowered may hold an inquiry into the 
cause of death either instead of, or in addition to, the 
investigation held by the police-officer, and if he does so, 
he shall have all the powers in conducting it which he 
would have in holding an inquiry into an offence. The 
Magistrate holding such an inquiry shall record the 
evidence taken by him in connection therewith in any of the 
manner 
hereinafter 
prescribed 
according 
to 
the 
circumstances of the case. 
(2). Power to disinter corpses. Whenever 
such Magistrate considers it expedient to make an 
examination of the dead body of any person who has been 
already interred, in order to discover the cause of death, the 
Magistrate may cause the body to be disinterred and 
examined.” 
5. 
While 
going 
through 
the 
aforesaid 
provisions of law, it is abundantly clear that the 
former Section prescribes the powers of Officer in-
charge of police station (or some other police 

W.P. No.70407/2021  
 
 
 
                        4 
 
official specially empowered by the Provincial 
Government) to undertake investigation  qua cause 
of death in cases mentioned in clauses (a), (b), ( c) 
of said section, whereas, the latter stipulates  the 
powers of Magistrate, who in case of death of a 
person while in custody of police ‘shall’ and in 
other cases mentioned in former section ‘may’ 
make an inquiry into the cause of death. This 
power is vested with the Magistrate either instead 
of, or in addition to investigation held by the police 
under Section 174 Cr.P.C.  Wisdom behind 
conferring such powers upon a Magistrate is 
apparently to have a check upon the inquiry held 
by the police or to dispel doubt in the mind of 
public against a particular person. In order to 
achieve this purpose, the Magistrate holding an 
inquiry as a part of “inquest” is empowered with 
all the powers which he possessed while doing an 
inquiry into an offence. He is supposed to record 
the evidence taken by him in connection with the 
inquest in any of the manners hereinafter 
prescribed according to the circumstances of the 
case. This fact leads me to the conclusion that 
disinterment proceedings before a Magistrate falls 
within a meaning of ‘judicial proceedings’ 
provided in Section 4(1)(m) of the Cr.P.C. which 
reads as under:- 
(m). 
“Judicial 
Proceeding”. 
“Judicial 
Proceeding” includes any proceeding in the 
course of which evidence is or may be 
legally taken on oath;” 
Any 
order 
passed 
pursuant 
to 
such 
proceedings 
would 
obviously 
be 
revisable. 
Reliance is placed on case reported as “Khuda 
Bakhsh ..Vs.. Province of West Pakistan and 

W.P. No.70407/2021  
 
 
 
                        5 
 
another (PLD 1957 (W.P.) Lahore 662”, wherein, 
a Division Bench has observed as under:- 
“ It was contended by the learned 
counsel for the petitioner that an order of the 
Magistrate who holds an inquiry either under 
Section 174 or section 176 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure is a judicial order which is 
open to scrutiny not by the Provincial 
Government but only by the High Court in the 
exercise of revisional powers and he relied in 
this connect on in re Laxminarayan Timmanna 
Karki (AIR 1928 Bom,390), wherein it was 
held that proceedings of a Magistrate under 
section 176 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 
are judicial proceedings which can be dealt with 
by the High Court in revision. He also relied 
upon Advocate-General v. Maung Chit Maung 
(AIR 1940 Rang.68), wherein the question for 
determination was whether a Magistrate holding 
an inquest was a Court subordinate to the High 
Court for the purposes of the Contempt of 
Courts Act and it was held that he was. I am in 
respectful agreement with the views expressed 
in the above two decisions and hold that the 
proceedings of a Magistrate who holds an 
inquest under the Code of Criminal Procedure 
are judicial proceedings, which are open to 
revision 
by 
the 
High 
Court.”(emphasis 
supplied) 
 This view has been consistently followed in 
cases reported as “Muhammad Anwar vs. Sheikh 
Qurban Ali and 3 others (1973 P Cr.LJ 882), 
Ghulam 
Hussain 
vs. 
District 
Magistrate 
Muzaffargar and 3 others (1992 P Cr.LJ 1870), 
Mansab Ali v. Asghar Ali Faheem Bhatti,

Additional Sessions Judge, Nankana Sahib and 3 
others (PLD 2007 Lahore 176).  
6. 
In case reported as “The State ..Vs.. Ch. 
Altaf Hussain Magistrate 1st Class, Gujrat and 2 
others ( PLD 1978 Lahore 1259)”, where daughter 
of the complainant breathed her last after 
sustaining bullet injury on her head and the 
complainant got lodged FIR against his son in law 
i.e. husband of deceased, however, his request, for 
dispensation of post mortem examination of the 
deceased was accorded by the Magistrate. 
Subsequently, Investigating Officer moved an 
application 
U/S 
176(2) 
Cr.P.C. 
seeking 
disinterment of the dead body for post mortem 
examination, 
which 
was 
permitted by 
the 
Magistrate, but upon revision by the complainant, 
order of Magistrate permitting disinterment of the 
corpse was set-aside and the issue came up before 
this Court , where this Court while maintaining the 
order of Revisional Court ruled in a very 
elaborative and instructive manner that:- 
“ I am in respectful agreement with the 
views expressed in this behalf in the rulings of 
Muhammad Anwar and Khuda Bakhsh. I may 
add that although the word “inquest” used in 
sections  174 and 176 Cr.P.C., has not been 
defined in the Code, it carries particular 
significance when the same is conducted by a 
Magistrate. 
Subsection (5)of section 174 
provides only that the District Magistrate, a 
Sub-Divisional Magistrate or Magistrate of the 
1st Class and any other Magistrate specially 
empowered in this behalf can hold inquests. 
Subsection (1) of section 176 gives an 
indication as to what would be the ordinary 
procedure in conducting the inquest. It is 

W.P. No.70407/2021  
 
 
 
                        7 
 
necessary for the Magistrate, when holding an 
enquiry as a part of the inquest, to “record the 
evidence 
taken 
by 
him 
in 
connection 
therewith”, in any of the manners prescribed in 
the Code of Criminal Procedure for conducting 
enquiries. The choice from amongst “the 
manners” has been left to the Magistrate and it 
would depend upon the circumstances of each 
case. Thus, the Magistrate, when holding an 
inquest, would be making an “enquiry” in 
accordance with the provisions of the Criminal 
Procedure Code and, thus, it would, all the 
more, make it a judicial function. Any order 
passed as a result of such an enquiry, would, 
obviously, be revisable. It is needless to 
emphasize that the power to be exercised under 
subsection 2 of section 176 for disinterment of 
the body is a part of the jurisdiction conferred 
on the Magistrate to hold inquests. If the entire 
process of the inquest is to be conducted as an 
enquiry, then the disinterment of the body 
would also form part of the enquiry and any 
order passed in this behalf would also be a 
judicial function. Looked at from this angle 
also, the orders dated 24-4-78 and 25-4-78 
passed by the learned Magistrate in this case 
have to be treated as judicial orders and the 
learned Additional Sessions Judge could decide 
the revision and pass the judgment, which has 
been impugned in these petitions.”( emphasis 
supplied) 
7. 
For what has been discussed above, I am of 
the considered view that impugned order of Area 
Magistrate declining disinterment of the corpse for 
the purpose of post mortem examination was a 
judicial 
order, 
amenable 
to 
the 
revisional 
jurisdiction and holding of the Revisional Court to 

W.P. No.70407/2021  
 
 
 
                        8 
 
the contrary is erroneous and cannot be allowed to 
hold the field. Resultantly, this writ petition is 
allowed as a result whereof impugned order of the 
Revisional Court dated 27.10.2021 is set-aside. 
Matter is remanded to the said Court with direction 
to decide the same on merits. Keeping in view the 
nature of lis, it is expected that the Revisional 
Court shall endeavor to finally decide the matter 
within fifteen days from the date of receipt of 
certified copy of this order.
