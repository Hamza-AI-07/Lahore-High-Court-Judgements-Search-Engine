Date of Hearing 
08.12.2023 
Petitioner by: 
Mr. Ijaz Ahmad Khan, Advocate. 
Respondent 
No.1 by: 
Barrister 
Abdullah 
N. 
Malik, 
Advocate. 
Respondent 
No.2 by: 
Mr. Hafeez-ur-Rehman Chaudhry 
and Mr. Labeeb Zafar Bajwa, 
Advocates. 
 
Anwaar Hussain J. Challenge has been laid to order dated 
03.10.2023, passed by the learned District Judge, Lahore who has 
proceeded to accept the application of respondent No.2 (“the 
respondent”), under Section 24 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 
(“CPC”), and has withdrawn the appeal preferred by the petitioner 
and revision filed by respondent No.1, pending before two separate 
Courts and fixed both the cases before himself, on the ground that the 
respondent has shown reservations regarding the Presiding Officer(s) 
concerned even though no such reservation is reflected in the 
application filed by the respondent.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the learned 
District Judge, Lahore has exercised the jurisdiction in irregular 
manner by withdrawing the cases and fixing them before himself and 
has also cast aspersions on the conduct of the Judicial Officers 
concerned. Further contends that the withdrawal and assignment of 
the cases is either in exercise of powers on the administrative side or 
the judicial side and none of the situation is applicable in the present 

 
 
2 
Civil Revision No.74007/2023 
 
 
case and the learned District Judge has gone beyond the contents of 
the application filed by the respondent and hence, acted in a manner 
that exhibits bias on part of the District Judge.  
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent submit that the 
impugned order was passed after hearing both the sides. Add that 
undoubtedly, no allegations of bias were alleged against any of the 
Judicial Officers, before whom the appeal of the petitioner and revision 
petition of respondent No.1 were pending, however, when the Court was 
apprised with the chequered history of the case, the learned District 
Judge decided to withdraw the said appeal and the revision and fixed the 
said cases before himself and in this regard drew guidance from the 
order dated 27.01.2023 passed by this Court in Transfer Application, 
filed by the petitioner, bearing T.A. No.75336/2022 whereby this Court 
directed the Senior Civil Judge Lahore to hear the cases himself instead 
of sending the same forming subject matter of said Transfer Application 
to Civil Judge, 1st Class, as prayed for by the petitioner in said T.A No. 
No.75336/2022. In this regard refers to the copy of order dated 
27.01.2023 passed in T.A No. No.75336/2022, brought on record of this 
Court, through C.M. No.2/2023 filed by the respondent. Confronted with 
the situation, in rebuttal, learned counsel for the petitioner states that the 
earlier round(s) of litigation including T.A No.75336/2022 is not 
relevant to the decision of present petition.  
4. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
5. 
Perusal of the application of the respondent for transfer of the 
cases for hearing before one Court does not envisage any reservations 
against the learned Additional Judges seized with the appeal and 
revision, however, the operative part of the impugned order reads as 
under: 
“4. 
Having heard learned counsel for the parties, 
present, and going through the available record, I am of the 
view that it would be appropriate in the interest of justice 

 
 
3 
Civil Revision No.74007/2023 
 
 
and also to allay apprehension of petitioner that both the 
appeal and revision should be heard and decided by one 
court. The petitioner has also shown certain reservations 
against both the learned Addl. District Judges. So, for 
ends of justice, the petition is accepted and both the appeal 
and revision are withdrawn from the above mentioned 
courts and are brought on the file of this court.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
      (Emphasis supplied) 
6. 
The only controversy involved is whether the learned District 
Judge, Lahore was justified in passing the impugned order and fixing 
both the cases before himself.  The petitioner has set up a case that in the 
absence of any reservation, against the Judicial Officers concerned, in 
the application filed by the respondent prayer whereof was confined only 
to the extent of consolidating the two cases before any one Court, and by 
casting the aspersion against the said Judicial Officers, the learned 
District Judge has committed illegality by withdrawing the cases from 
two different Courts and fixing them before himself. To put it 
differently, it is the case of the petitioner that the application of the 
respondent should have been allowed by consolidation of the cases 
before either of the two Courts before whom the appeal of the petitioner 
or the revision of respondent No.1, as the case may be, was pending. 
Thus, the impugned order can be bifurcated into two parts. One aspect 
relates to the scope of Section 24, CPC which confers power upon the 
District Judge to transfer and consolidate the cases pending before the 
Courts subordinate to him whereas the other is relating to the 
unwarranted aspersions cast upon the Judicial Officers.  
7. 
The respondent side has explained that during the course of 
arguments the learned District Judge was apprised with the chequered 
history of the matter, which ended up before the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan and in the second round of litigation, T.A No.75336/2022 
before this Court was filed by the petitioner for transfer of the case 
pending before Civil Judge Class-II to Civil Judge 1st Class and while 
disposing of the said Transfer Application, this Court directed the Senior 

 
 
4 
Civil Revision No.74007/2023 
 
 
Civil Judge concerned to hear and decide the matter himself and not the 
Civil Judge, 1st Class and in this backdrop, the learned District Judge has 
passed the impugned order. The explanation seems to be plausible. 
Perusal of T.A. No.75336/2022 and the order dated 27.01.2023 passed 
by this Court substantiates the contention of learned counsel for the 
respondent. The order passed by this Court in T.A. No.75336/2022 reads 
as under:  
 “27.01.2023 Mr. Ijaz Ahmad Khan, Advocate for the 
applicant.  
 
Mr. 
Hafeez 
ur 
Rehman 
Chaudhary, 
Advocate for the respondents.  
 
 
 
 
Through this Transfer Application 
the applicant made a request that the 
execution petition titled “Muhammad 
Tariq Niaz v. LDA etc.” may be 
transferred from the learned Civil Judge, 
Class-II, Lahore to any court of Civil 
Judge, Class-I, Lahore. The learned 
counsel appearing on behalf of the 
respondent has no objection for the 
acceptance of this transfer application.  
 
2. 
In view of the above, this Transfer 
Application is hereby accepted and the 
execution petition titled “Muhammad 
Tariq Niaz Vs. LDA etc.” is hereby 
transferred from the court of Mr. 
Muhammad Tariq Rasheed Qamar, Civil 
Executing Judge Class-II, Lahore to the 
learned Senior Civil Judge, Lahore who 
shall himself adjudicate upon the matter 
and complete the proceedings strictly in 
accordance with law as expeditiously as 
possible.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     (Emphasis supplied) 
8. 
Moreover, the argument of learned counsel for the petitioner that 
the learned District Judge has travelled beyond the prayer of the 
application before him is misconceived inasmuch as the learned District 
Judge, on his own or on the application of a litigant, is empowered to 

 
 
5 
Civil Revision No.74007/2023 
 
 
transfer the case from one Court to another Court subordinate to it or 
hear it himself. Section 24, CPC reads as under: 
 
“24. 
General 
power 
of 
transfer 
and 
withdrawal.-- (1) On the application of any of the 
parties and after notice to the parties and after hearing 
such of them as desire to be heard, or of its own 
motion without such notice, the High Court or the 
District Court may at any stage- 
(a) transfer any suit, appeal or other proceeding 
pending before it for trial or disposal to any Court 
subordinate to it and competent to try or dispose of 
the same, or  
(b) withdraw any suit, appeal or other proceeding 
pending in any Court subordinate to it, and  
(i) try or dispose of the same; or 
 (ii) transfer the same for trial or disposal to any 
Court subordinate to it and competent to try or 
dispose of the same; or  
(iii) retransfer the same for trial or disposal to the 
Court from which it was withdrawn.”  
(Emphasis supplied) 
9. 
It has been argued with vehemence that prayer of application of 
the respondent was only limited to combining/transferring the two 
cases before any one Court out of the learned Additional District 
Judges concerned who were hearing the cases, and keeping the said 
cases before himself shows personal interest of the learned District 
Judge. Argument is mis-conceived if not bizarre. Section 24, CPC 
does not specify any ground on which the case can be transferred from 
one Court to another. In the present case, transfer was solicited for the 
purpose of avoiding multiple proceedings and conflicting decisions on 
the same subject, between the same parties, involving common 
questions of fact and law that are interdependent, and after hearing 
arguments of the both sides, the learned District Judge thought it 

 
 
6 
Civil Revision No.74007/2023 
 
 
expedient to keep the cases before him on account of its chequered 
history. Suffice to mention that there is neither any clog under the law 
debarring the District Judge from retaining and fixing the cases before 
himself nor the same renders the petitioner aggrieved of the impugned 
order. It is unpleasantly surprising that learned District Judge, Lahore 
has just fixed the cases before himself and is yet to proceed with the 
same, however, allegation of bias has been levelled against the Judge 
even before he proceeded with the matter, which is reflective of the 
shallowness of the contentions of the petitioner. Such preemptive 
allegation of bias devoid of any material or substance on record is 
liable to be thrown out invariably. It is a serious matter and such bald 
and unsubstantiated assertions cannot be countenanced and are not 
sufficient to upend the impugned order.  
10. 
The above observation and opinion of this Court in respect of 
unsubstantiated and shallow allegation of bias is equally applicable to 
the second part of the impugned order passed by the learned District 
Judge, Lahore wherein he has observed that the respondent has 
reservations over the Judicial Officers hearing the appeal and revision 
of the parties, which is a cause of concern for this Court. While the 
impugned order through which the matters pending before two 
different Courts have been kept by the learned District Judge, Lahore 
before himself does not suffer from any illegality or irregularity, in the 
light of the chequered history of the lis between the parties; there was 
no justification to record observations regarding the Judicial Officers 
concerned.  Suffice to observe that District Level Judiciary is the 
backbone of the judicial system in the country and is performing the 
onerous task of dispensing justice as held by the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in case reported as “Hasnain Raza v. Lahore High Court 
(PLD 2022 SC 7).  It is obligatory on part of this Court to protect and 
safeguard the District Level Judiciary from any onslaught or intrusion, 

 
 
7 
Civil Revision No.74007/2023 
 
 
let alone in the form of observation, amounting to distrust or 
apprehension thereof qua the integrity of a Judicial Officer(s) in the 
discharge of the judicial work, by the learned District Judge, Lahore, 
who was exercising his discretion under Section 24, CPC, while 
deciding the Transfer Application of the respondent, more 
particularly, when no such allegation were levelled in the said 
application. Such observations bring the District Level Judiciary into 
disrespect that is exhibited by the fact that through the present petition 
generalized statement of bias has been made against the learned 
District Judge himself. This Court is of the opinion that the learned 
District Judges or the learned Additional Judges, across the province, 
while hearing the cases before them must show restraint in recording 
any observation in respect of the conduct of the Judicial Officers 
subordinate to them, which may tend to weaken the institutional 
independence of the Judiciary and bring it into disrespect.   
11. 
For the above reasons, the present petition is devoid of any 
merits and the impugned order is upheld with the modification that the 
observation of the learned District Judge, Lahore thereof in the terms 
that “The petitioner has also shown certain reservations against both 
the learned Addl. District Judges” are uncalled for and shall not be read 
as part of the impugned order.    
12. 
Disposed of in above terms.
