          SULTAN TANVIR AHMAD, J:- Through this 
petition, filed under section 561-A of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure, 1898 (the ‘Code’), the petitioner has challenged 
order dated 12.06.2023 passed by learned Additional 
Sessions Judge, Lahore, whereby, the revision-petition filed 
by the State has been allowed  and order dated 04.06.2023 
passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate Section 30, Lahore 

2 
Crl. Misc. No.40242 –M  of 2023 
( the ‘Magistrate’) refusing the physical remand of the 
petitioner in case FIR No.09/2023 dated 03.06.2023, 
registered under section 420, 468, 471, 161, 162/34 PPC 
read with section 5(2) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 
1947, 
with 
Anti-Corruption 
Establishment 
District 
Headquarter, Punjab, Lahore, has been set aside. 
2.  
Mr. Asif Mehmood Cheema, learned counsel for 
the petitioner has submitted that while passing order dated 
04.06.2023 the learned Magistrate exercised powers under 
section 167 of the Code and while exercising these powers 
he has not acted as a Court subordinate to the Court of 
Sessions, therefore, the same could not have been revised 
under section 435 and 439-A of the Code. He has submitted 
that the order of the learned Magistrate was not a judicial 
order, thus, the same was not subject to the revisional 
jurisdiction of the Court of Sessions. Learned counsel for the 
petitioner has next submitted that without prejudice to the 
above argument, learned “Special Judge” appointed in terms 
of Section 3 of the Pakistan Criminal Law Amendment Act, 
1958 (the ‘Act of 1958’)  was the only Court that had the 
powers of revision. He has relied upon section 6 (1) of the 
Act of 1958 and contended that all provisions of the Code 
are applicable to the proceedings before the Court of 
“Special Judge”. He read above said sub-section of the Act 
of 1958 and stated that since the provisions of the Code 
(except Chapter XXXVIII) are applicable to the proceedings 
before the “Special Judge”, therefore, the powers under 
section 435 and 439-A also vested with the “Special Judge”, 
thus ordinary Court of Sessions had no jurisdiction and the 
order assailed before this Court is coram non judice. Mr. 
Asif Mehmood, learned counsel for the petitioner contended 
that even otherwise, the order of learned Additional Sessions 

3 
Crl. Misc. No.40242 –M  of 2023 
Judge is against the facts. 
3.  
Mr. Abdul Samad, learned Additional Prosecutor 
General and Ch. Ghulam Sarwar Nehang, learned Additional 
Advocate General have submitted that order dated 
04.06.2023 passed by the learned Magistrate refusing the 
physical remand was a judicial order and the same is 
correctly and validly revised under section 435 read with 
439-A of the Code; that the Court of Sessions has rightly 
examined the record of the proceedings before the learned 
Magistrate, which is inferior criminal Court and after 
satisfying itself the order of the learned Magistrate has been 
set aside for which cogent reasons have been recorded, 
therefore, the same requires no interference by this Court. 
4.  
Heard. Documents available on the file have been 
perused with the able assistance of learned counsel for the 
parties.  
5.  
As far as the contention of learned counsel for the 
petitioner that the order of learned Magistrate, whereby, he 
refused to allow physical remand, being executive order, is 
not amenable to revisional jurisdiction is concerned. This 
aspect of the matter has already been considered by this 
Court in several cases, including cases titled “Abdul Waheed 
Versus Additional Sessions Judge And Others” (2017 MLD 
1319), “Zawar Hussain Versus The State And 3 Others” 
(2009  P.Cr. L.J 705), “Misbah-Ul-Hassan Versus The 
State And 3 Others” (2005 P Cr. L J 1709) and “Riaz Ul 
Haq And Another Versus Muhammad Naveed And Another” 
(2005 YLR 805). This Court has already settled that an 
order passed by the learned Magistrate refusing remand is a 
judicial function and under section  435 of the Code, the 
Court superior to the one refusing remand can exercise 
jurisdiction of revision. In “Abdul Waheed” case (supra), 

4 
Crl. Misc. No.40242 –M  of 2023 
this Court has concluded this matter as follows:- 
“Same view was expressed in other cases cited 
by learned counsel for respondents. However, 
in the case titled “Nasreen Bibi v. Nazir Ahmad 
and another” (2001 MLD 1459), cited by 
learned counsel for the petitioner, it was 
observed that revision against order passed by 
Magistrate was not maintainable as it was not a 
judicial order and it could be challenged in 
constitutional jurisdiction of this Court. The 
case law cited by learned counsel for 
respondents i.e. “Riaz ul Haq and another v. 
Muhammad Naveed and another”(2005 YLR 
805), is more pertinent to the question involved 
in this case, being identical on the facts. Two 
questions came under consideration in the case 
cited by learned counsel for respondents; 
firstly, whether order passed by the learned 
Judicial Magistrate refusing remand was a 
judicial order and secondly complainant had 
locus standi to file revision petition against the 
order passed by learned Judicial Magistrate. 
Regarding first question, it was observed that 
not granting physical remand was a judicial 
function and that a complainant in a criminal 
case had locus standi to file the revision 
petition being an aggrieved person”. 
 
 
 
(Underlining is added) 
 
In “Riaz Ul Haq and another” case (supra), after 
detailed analysis of the earlier case law and the relevant 
provisions, this Court observed as follows:- 
The order for not granting the physical remand 
passed by learned Magistrate 1st Class in a case 
registered under section 392, P.P.C. is a 
judicial function. The reliance in this respect 
can be safely placed on 1984 PCr. LJ 2588 
titled as Ghulam Sarwar and another v. The 
State and 1969 PCr. LJ 873 (Lahore) titled as 
Muhammad Rafi v. The State and 2 others and 
subsections (3) and (4) of section 167, Cr.P.C., 
which are reproduced below:-- 
 
“167. Procedure when investigation cannot be 
completed in twenty four hours.---  
(1) ……………… 
(2) ……………… 
(3)  
A Magistrate authorizing under this 

5 
Crl. Misc. No.40242 –M  of 2023 
section detention in the custody of the police 
shall record his reasons for so doing. 
(4)  
The Magistrate giving such order shall 
forward a copy of his order with his reasons for 
making it, to the Sessions Judge.” 
 
6.  
This aspect was also examined in Writ Petition No. 
3780 of 2010 titled “Muhammad Aslam, etc. Vs. The State, 
etc.” in which this Court has observed that the order for 
refusal of remand is outcome of judicial function and when 
the Court of Sessions comes to the conclusion that any 
illegality or irregularity is committed, revisional jurisdiction 
u/s 435 read with Section 439-A of the Code can be 
exercised. It will be beneficial to reproduce the following 
extract of the said judgment:- 
“It will be a judicial order and it is sent to the 
Court of Sessions only for the purpose in the 
light of Section 435 read with Section 439-A 
Cr.PC which comes to his knowledge and if he 
comes to the conclusion that any illegality or 
irregularity has been committed, he can 
exercise his revisional jurisdiction under 
Section 435 Cr.PC read with Section 439-A 
Cr.PC; hence, by bare reading of Section 435 
to 439-A read with Section 167 Cr.PC it 
becomes clear that the order passed under 
Section 167 Cr.PC is a judicial order and 
revisable 
by 
Sessions 
Judge/ 
Additional 
Sessions. Reliance is placed upon 2005 YLR 
805. 
19. 
For what has been discussed above, it is 
crystal clear that the order passed by the 
learned Magistrate under Section 167 Cr.PC is 
a judicial order and passed in judicial 
proceedings; 
hence, 
learned 
Additional 
Sessions, Haslipur in the case in hand has 
rightly entertained the revision petition and 
passed the impugned order.” 
 
7.   
The main question raised before this Court, also a 
reason of admission of this petition, is that only “Special 
Judge” appointed in terms of section 3 of the Act of 1958 
has power to pass an order in revision. Mr. Asif Mehmood, 

6 
Crl. Misc. No.40242 –M  of 2023 
learned counsel for the petitioner, has relied on section 6(1) 
of the Act of 1958  that reads as follows:- 
6.  
Procedure in trial of cases and 
powers of Special Judges-  
(1) The provisions of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1898, except those of 
chapter XXXVIII of that Code, shall, in so 
far as they are not inconsistent with this Act, 
apply to the proceedings of the Court of a 
Special Judge and for the purposes of the 
said provisions, the Court of a Special 
Judge shall be deemed to be a Court of 
Session trying cases without the aid of 
assessors or jury, and a person conducting 
prosecution before the Court of a Special 
Judge shall be deemed to be a public 
prosecutor.

8.  
The above sub-section provides that in course of 
trial the provisions of the Code shall apply to the 
“proceedings” in the Court of “Special Judge”. The question 
remained before me if the word ‘proceedings’ in the above 
section is used in wider sense to cover the cases of remand 
and its revision or if it is used in narrower sense just to cover 
the cases when the matter is brought before the “Special 
Judge” in the shape of complaint or through report by the 
police or concerned agency. Word “proceedings” is not  
defined in the Act of 1958, however, Code has defined the 
word “judicial proceeding”. The section 4 (m) of the Code 
reads as follows:- 
4(m) 
“Judicial 
proceeding”. 
“Judicial 
proceeding” includes any proceeding in the 
course of which evidence is or may be 
legally taken on oath.” 

7 
Crl. Misc. No.40242 –M  of 2023 
9.  
As per above definition “judicial proceeding” 
includes any proceeding in the course of which evidence is 
or may be legally taken on oath. Section 4 of the Act of 1958 
further provides that a “Special Judge” shall have 
jurisdiction, in the given territorial limits, upon receiving a 
complaint of facts which constitutes such offence or upon a 
report in writing of such facts made by any police officer.   
The word ‘proceedings’ sometime is given wider meanings 
to cover the remaining steps towards progress of a case but 
when section 6 of the Act of 1958 is read with the heading of 
the section, in its context and in the light of surrounding 
provisions, it appears that legislature intended to give 
restricted meaning to the word “proceedings”. 
10. 
In case titled “Satyahari Choudhury v. The State” 
(A.I.R. 1953 CAL. 661) a Division Bench of  Calcutta High 
Court, facing similar circumstances, reached to the 
following conclusion:- 
“(5) Under S. 167, Criminal P. C. if 
investigation cannot be completed within 24 
hours the police must produce the accused 
before a Magistrate and the Magistrate even 
if he has no jurisdiction to try the case may 
order further detention from time to time not 
exceeding 15 days on the whole or he may 
grant bail if he so thinks fit. Under the 
provisions of the Constitution, production 
before a Magistrate within 24 hours is now 
compulsory, but a case would not be allotted 
to a Special Court until the charge- sheet is 
ready, and proceedings before a Special 
Court would commence ordinarily with the 
submission of charge-sheet or a complaint 
by a police officer after completion of the 
investigation. Before that stage is reached 
the accused must be produced before an 
ordinary Magistrate and it cannot be argued 
that since the accused is produced before 
the ordinary Magistrate and the question of 

8 
Crl. Misc. No.40242 –M  of 2023 
bail is considered there is a proceeding 
before the Court and therefore S. 12 of Act 
21 of 1949 bars the jurisdiction of the 
Special Court. We must agree, therefore, 
with the learned Special Judge in holding 
that the words ‘proceedings pending before 
a Court’ in S. 12 of Act 21 of 1949 would 
mean judicial proceedings which started 
with the submission of a charge-sheet or a 
complaint or taking cognizance thereon. In 
this case there were no proceedings pending 
on 9-4-1952, when the Ordinance came into 
force and therefore, S. 12 of the Act does not 
bar the jurisdiction of the Special Court.” 
 
 
 
(Underlining is added) 
 
 
I am of the firm opinion that the learned Court of 
Sessions can decide a revision petition arising out of the 
order of refusal of physical remand.  
11. 
The learned Magistrate in some apparent haste has 
refused the physical remand on the very first day when the 
petitioner was produced before him, therefore, the learned 
Sessions Court intervened after examination of record of the 
proceeding of its inferior Court and after satisfying itself  the 
learned Sessions Court has exercised its jurisdiction under 
section 435 read with 439-A of the Code. The case has been 
dealt in detail by the learned Sessions Court by giving 
cogent reasons. No ground convincing to exercise inherent 
powers of section 561-A of the Code, to give effect to any 
order under the Code or to prevent abuse of any Court, is 
made out. This petition, therefore, fails. No order as to costs.
