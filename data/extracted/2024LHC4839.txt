      Anwaar Hussain, J.  Through the present Civil Revision, the 
petitioner, namely, Mst. Kubra Bibi has laid challenge to order dated 
04.07.2018 passed by the learned Trial Court as also order dated 
26.01.2019 passed by the learned Appellate Court below. Through 
the former order, the learned Senior Civil Judge, Muzaffargarh 
issued succession certificate in the application filed by respondent 
No.3 (“respondent”) titled “Mehboob Akhtar, etc. v. Public at 
Large, etc.” in which the petitioner was arrayed as respondent No.7 
whereas through the latter order, the appeal preferred by the 
petitioner was dismissed.  
2. 
By way of factual background, it has been noted that the 
respondent, being one of the legal heirs of deceased Muhammad 
Bukhsh, applied for grant of succession certificate regarding amount 

2 
C.R. No.350-D of 2019 
 
 
of Rs.1,150,926/- lying in Account bearing No.10400100029401, 
maintained with Punjab Cooperative Bank, Muzaffargarh in the 
name of deceased Muhammad Bakhsh. The present petitioner, who 
was respondent No.7 in the application filed contesting written 
statement with the averments that the said account was joint in 
nature in which she made her father as a joint account holder and the 
whole amount available in the account was deposited by the 
petitioner, which she earned from teaching in a private school. On 
the other hand, the respondent took stance that the disputed account 
was to devolved upon both account holders. Issues were framed and 
evidence was led and recorded whereafter through order dated 
04.07.2018, the application for grant of succession certificate was 
allowed and appeal preferred by the petitioner was dismissed vide 
order dated 26.01.2019.  
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the findings 
of the Courts below on issues No.1 and 2 are the result of 
misreading of evidence as well as misconstruction of the applicable 
law. Adds that although findings are concurrent but the same 
proceeded on illegality, which merits interference by this Court in 
terms of powers conferred under Section 115 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908. Further adds that the respondent-Bank has failed to 
produce the Account Opening Form wherein it was categorically 
recorded that the account was to be operated by “either or survivor” 
and after the death of predecessor-in-interest of the parties, it was 
the petitioner who was entitled to the proceeds lying in the said 
account.  
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent-Bank submits 
the Account Opening Form was not available with the respondent-
Bank, however, while relying on the Bank’s policy, which was 
brought on record as Exh.C-1, the application of the respondent was 

3 
C.R. No.350-D of 2019 
 
 
allowed as the said policy clearly depicted that the account was to be 
operated by anyone. Despite service, no one on behalf of the 
respondents No. 3 to 7 have not appeared and hence, they were 
proceeded against ex-parte 14.12.2021.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
6. 
 The nub of the matter is to examine the scope of instructions, 
i.e., “either or survivor” given by the joint account holders to a bank 
where they maintained their joint account qua rights of the legal 
heirs of one of the joint holders, upon the death of the latter.  
7. 
Generally, in banking operations, if the account is in the name 
of two individuals, the amount lying therein is payable to either of 
the joint holders, on demand and/or date of maturity or to the 
survivor on death of any of the account holders. The legal question 
involved has been subject matter of number of cases before this 
Court as also before the other Coordinate High Courts in Pakistan. 
In case reported as “Syed Shah Pr Mian Kazmi v. Mst. Nelofer 
(widow) and others” (PLD 2012 Peshawar 101), it was held that, 
under the Islamic Law of Inheritance, no legal heir of a deceased 
bank account holder could be deprived from receiving his/her share 
from the bank account of the deceased even if there is nomination in 
favour of some other person or there are instructions on record such 
as “either or survivor”. This Court in case of “Dubai Islamic Bank 
Pakistan, etc. v. Mst. Saima Yasin etc.” bearing Civil Revision No. 
55-D of 2020 also held that with death of an account holder of joint 
account any authorization/authority given by the deceased stood 
automatically revoked and even a validly authorized person is 
denuded of such power after death of the principal as all assets of 
deceased by operation of law stood vested in the ownership of legal 
heirs of the deceased and the bank or the joint account holder are not 
empowered to unilaterally operate the account or withdraw any 

4 
C.R. No.350-D of 2019 
 
 
amount until and unless as per law a declaration of the rendition of 
account is obtained and succession certificate or letter of 
administration or probate is issued by the court of competent 
jurisdiction. 
8. 
Having above elucidation on the legal question in sight, this 
Court is of the opinion that the said guidelines or stipulations 
contained in a Bank Account Opening Form are mere operating 
instructions. The said operating instructions cannot be given 
precedence over the law of inheritance. These instructions are meant 
to safeguard the banks in situations where one of the joint account 
holders dies and it does not come to the knowledge of the banks 
and/or any claim by the legal heirs of the deceased joint account 
holders is not intimated to the bank and the bank in good faith pays 
the amount, lying with it, to the surviving account holder(s). In such 
situation, the bank may be absolved from any liability keeping in 
view the facts of a particular case. The legal heirs of the deceased 
account holder can claim the recovery from the surviving joint 
holders; however, it does not give unfettered power to the bank to 
unilaterally facilitate the surviving joint holder(s) to withdraw all the 
money.  
9. 
Moreover, the evidentiary resume of the case reveals that 
though Account Opening Form was not brought on record by either 
of the parties, however, specimen signature card was got exhibited 
as Exh.R.01, which indicates that account was joint and to be 
operated by any one and was not treated as “either or survivor” as 
claimed by the petitioner. During the course of arguments before this 
Court, learned counsel for the petitioner did acknowledge that the 
father of the petitioner was joint account holder who had valuable 
land and used to receive the lease money. The claim of the petitioner 
that the entire amount lying in the bank account was owned by the 

5 
C.R. No.350-D of 2019 
 
 
petitioner, which she avers to have received on account of salary as a 
private teacher, is also belied by this fact. In fact, the petitioner has 
failed to prove her source of income, which also persuaded the 
Courts below to decide against her.  
10. 
There are concurrent findings of law and facts against the 
petitioner, which are immune from interference by this Court in its 
revisional jurisdiction unless there is some gross illegality, 
irregularity, jurisdictional defect, misreading or non-reading of 
evidence therein. Learned counsel for the petitioner has failed to 
point out any such defect in the impugned findings.  
11. 
In view of what has been discussed above, the instant civil 
revision is dismissed being devoid of merits. No order as to costs.
