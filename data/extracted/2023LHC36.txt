JUDGMENT  
 
Date of hearing:   
10.01.2023 
 
Appellants by:  
Ch. Muhammad Shakeel, Advocate 
Respondents by:   
Mian Abdul Rasheed, Advocate  
----------------------------------- 
 
  
MUZAMIL AKHTAR SHABIR, J: Through this Regular 
First Appeal, the appellants have called in question order dated 
17.12.2021 passed by learned Civil Judge, Sheikhupura, whereby suit 
for specific performance of agreement to sell filed by the appellants 
under Section 12 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877, has been dismissed 
for failure to produce evidence.  
2.  
Learned counsel for the appellants states that on one hand, in 
order dated 13.12.2021, the learned trial court observed that evidence 
of plaintiffs/ appellants (‘appellants’) was present in the court yet 
adjourned the matter on the ground that request for adjournment had 
been made as evidence was not available and on next date i.e. 
17.12.2021 went on to dismiss the appellants’ suit due to non-
availability of evidence and such a contradictory order was not 
sustainable. Besides sufficient opportunities were not provided to the 

R.F.A.No. 7238 of 2022  
Dated 10.01.2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                         
 
2
appellants to lead evidence as on various dates the matter was fixed 
for decision of certain applications and not for recording of evidence 
of the appellants, hence, said adjournments could not be attributed to 
the appellants to close their evidence.  
3.  
On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents has 
defended the impugned order dated 17.12.2021 by stating that various 
opportunities were provided to the appellants to lead evidence and on 
their failure to do the same, their right to lead evidence was rightly 
closed under Order XVII Rule 3 of the C.P.C.  
4.  
Heard. Record perused. 
5.  
The appellants on 10.07.2017 filed suit for specific performance 
of agreement to sell dated 14.08.2010 against the respondents, which 
was contested by the respondents and issues were framed on 
07.10.2018, where-after on 16.10.2018, fresh power of attorney was 
filed on behalf of the respondents, whereas Ahmad Raza/plaintiff No. 
2 appeared in the court and got recorded his statement. After that the 
matter was adjourned to 25.10.2018 and although evidence was not 
available on next some dates, however, on 19.01.2019 when evidence 
was available in the court for the purpose of recording of the same an 
application was moved by the respondents under Order VII Rule 11 of 
the C.P.C, which was kept pending till 25.02.2019 when the same was 
dismissed as being devoid of merits and matter was fixed on 
12.03.2019 for recording of appellants’ evidence when adjournment 
was sought by the appellants. The witnesses were again available on

Dated 10.01.2023

next date fixed for hearing on 22.03.2019, however, their evidence 
could not be recorded as respondents were not available for cross-
examination. Two witnesses were again available on 30.09.2019 and 
matter was adjourned for 20.04.2019, however, on 20.04.2019 when 
witnesses were not available, matter was adjourned to 20.05.2019 for 
recording of evidence and on the said date, the learned trial court was 
informed that the order of dismissal of application under Order VII 
Rule 11 of the C.P.C has been challenged by the respondents before 
the learned revisional court, where-after matter was adjourned by trial 
court on various dates for awaiting decision of the same till 
14.10.2019, when application was filed on behalf of the respondents 
to amend their written statement, which matter was adjourned on 
various dates for proceedings on said application, where-after on 
21.03.2020 another application for clarification of order dated 
05.09.2018 was filed which was disposed of  and matter was listed for 
hearing on 18.04.2020 for arguments on application for amendment of 
written statement, which was kept on pending till 18.11.2020 when it 
was noticed that revisional court on revision against the dismissal of 
application under Order VII Rule 11 of the C.P.C had passed order to 
stay the proceedings of the trial court, where-after the matter again 
kept on lingering for quite some time during which period the case 
was once transferred from one court to another. On 08.11.2021 the 
application for amendment of written statement was disposed of and 
matter was listed for hearing on 25.11.2021, when evidence of the 

R.F.A.No. 7238 of 2022  
Dated 10.01.2023

appellants was not available and matter was adjourned for 01.12.2021 
when copy of order of the High Court was tendered, whereby 
direction had been issued for expeditious disposal of the matter; on 
both the said dates the matter was adjourned for recording of evidence 
with costs of Rs. 500/-. On 08.12.2021 the counsel for the appellants 
sought adjournment as the plaintiff/appellant had seriously fallen ill. 
The matter where-after was adjourned to 13.12.2021 when evidence 
was available in the court as per attendance marked by the court, 
however, in the body of the order it was mentioned that evidence was 
not available and matter was adjourned for recording of evidence at 
the appellants’ request subject to payment of costs of Rs. 500/- for 
17.12.2021. For clarity, the order dated 13.12.2021 is reproduced 
below:- 
“13.12.2021 
 ORDER 
 Present: 
 Muhammad Shakeel Advocate on behalf of plaintiff. 
 Mian Abdul Rasheed Advocate for the defendants 
 Evidence of plaintiff is present 
 
  
Today suit taken up for production/recording entire 
evidence on behalf of the plaintiffs, with warning of last, final, 
absolute opportunity, evidence is not present but learned counsel 
on behalf of plaintiffs again requested for an adjournment without 
mentioning any plausible reason, for which learned counsel for 
defendants raised strict objection, which is much plausible, but on 
request of learned counsel for plaintiffs in the interest of justice, 
only one last, final, absolute opportunity is hereby granted for 
production/recording entire evidence of plaintiffs for 17.12.2021 
subject to payment of cost Rs. 500/-, in case of failure, right of 
plaintiffs for production/recording of entire evidence shall be 
closed under Order XVII Rule 3 of the CPC and no no further 
opportunity shall be granted on any eventuality.”

6.  
On 17.12.2021, the evidence of the appellants was closed and 
suit was dismissed for want of evidence under Order XVII Rule 3 of 
the C.P.C. The claim of the appellants is that as their evidence was 
available in the court on 13.12.2021, therefore, there was no occasion 
for them to request for an adjournment for recording of evidence and 
the said aspect of the matter has wrongly been noted by the learned 
trial court to adjourn the matter and the same could not be used 
against the appellants to close their evidence on the next date of 
hearing fixed on 17.12.2021, whereas claim of the respondents is that 
it had wrongly been noted that evidence was available on 13.12.2021. 
Perusal of order dated 13.12.2021 shows that although it is mentioned 
that adjournment was sought by the appellants due to non-availability 
of evidence yet attendance marked on that date shows that evidence of 
plaintiff was present. The afore-referred order is contradictory to that 
extent as on one hand evidence of the appellants was shown to be 
present whereas on the other hand it was mentioned that evidence was 
not available and adjournment has been sought on behalf of the 
appellants, where-after on the next date, due to non-availability of 
evidence, their right to produce evidence was closed. From the above 
noted contradiction in order dated 13.12.2021 it cannot be concluded 
with certainty that request for adjournment had been made by the 
appellants. The court was required to pass a clear order as to what 
proceedings had actually taken place on 13.12.2021, however, as the 
previous order dated 13.12.2021 was contradictory order and from the 

R.F.A.No. 7238 of 2022  
Dated 10.01.2023

facts narrated above, it could not be concluded with precision as to 
what actually transpired in the court on the said date and it is settled 
principle of safe administration of justice that an act of court shall 
prejudice no one. Reliance in this regard is placed on judgment 
reported as 2022 SCMR 1546 (Homoeo Dr. Asma Noreen Syed Vs. 
Government of the Punjab through its Secretary Health, Department & 
others) and PLD 2020 Supreme Court 559 (Sikandar Hayat and 
another versus the State and others). Reliance in this regard may be 
placed on very recent judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan passed in C.P.No. 2021/2019 titled as Abdul Qudoos v. 
Commandant Frontier Constabulary, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 
Peshawar & another (2022 SCP 352) announced on 04.10.2022, the 
relevant portion of the same is reproduced below:- 
“11. It is the foremost duty of the Court and Tribunal to do 
complete justice. A patent and obvious error or oversight on the 
part of Court in any order or decision may be reviewed 
sanguine to the renowned legal maxim “actus curiae neminem 
gravabit”, which is a well-settled enunciation and articulation 
of law expressing that no man should suffer because of the fault 
of the Court or an act of the Court shall prejudice no one and 
this principle also denotes the extensive pathway for the safe 
administration of justice. It is interrelated and intertwined with 
the state of affairs where the Court is under an obligation to 
reverse the wrong done to a party by the act of Court which is 
an elementary doctrine and tenet to the system of administration 
of justice beyond doubt that no person should suffer because of 
a delay in procedure or the fault of the Court. This is a de 
rigueur sense of duty in the administration of justice that the 
Court and Tribunal should become conscious and cognizant that 
as a consequence of their mistake, nobody should become a 
victim of injustice and, in the event of any injustice or harm 
suffered by mistake of the Court, it should be remedied by 
making necessary correction forthwith. If the Court is satisfied 
that it has committed a mistake, then such person should be 
restored to the position which he would have acquired if the 
mistake did not happen. This expression is established on the 

R.F.A.No. 7238 of 2022  
Dated 10.01.2023

astuteness and clear-sightedness that a wrong order should not 
be perpetuated by preserving it full of life or stand in the way 
under the guiding principle of justice and good conscience. So 
in all fairness, it is an inescapable and inevitable duty that if 
any such patent error on the face of it committed as in this case, 
the same must be undone without shifting blame to the parties 
and without further ado being solemn duty of the Court to 
rectify the mistake. Ref: Homoeo Dr. Asma Noreen Syed Vs. 
Government of the Punjab through its Secretary Health, 
Department & others (2022 SCMR 1546 = 2022 PLC (C.S) 
1390)” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
7.  
Moreover, in case reported as 2016 SCMR 40 (Wasal Khan 
and others versus Dr. Niaz Ali Khan) it has been held that courts are 
under obligation to facilitate the litigants to a maximum extent by 
passing a clear order, giving direction without any ambiguity to the 
litigant to act in a certain way and in a particular manner and the 
litigant should not be pushed into realm of guess work, where in an 
uncertain situation, he is unable how to proceed and is left guessing as 
to in what manner to comply with the order of the court. Once it is 
established that initial error was committed by the learned Civil Judge 
then the blame cannot be shifted to the party in view of well 
embedded principle that an act of court shall prejudice none.  
8.  
 In the present case, the order dated 13.12.2021 was not passed 
in clear and unambiguous terms and it is not clear as to whether on 
13.12.2021 evidence was available in the court or not and whether 
adjournment was actually sought by the appellants and if yes under 
what scenario and in these circumstances coupled with the fact that 
simultaneously various applications also remained pending before the 
trial court, the conduct of the appellants could not be declared to be 

R.F.A.No. 7238 of 2022  
Dated 10.01.2023

contumacious,  therefore, penal action should not have been taken on 
17.12.2021 against the plaintiffs/appellants for the reason that right to 
produce evidence could only be closed under Order XVII Rule 3 of 
the C.P.C when on the pen ultimate date request for adjournment had 
been made by the appellants in clear terms. Resultantly, the impugned 
order is not sustainable in view of the principle laid down by the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the afore-referred judgments. 
Furthermore, as the appellants have claimed to have paid the entire 
amount of consideration against the agreement to the respondents and 
nothing is outstanding, hence, it would be in the interest of justice that 
matter is decided on its merits and not on technical grounds besides 
nothing terrible would happen if another opportunity is allowed to the 
appellants to lead evidence rather the same would advance the cause 
of justice.  
9.  
Consequently, we allow this Regular First Appeal, set aside the 
impugned order dated 17.12.2021 and remand the matter to the 
learned trial court to provide another opportunity to the appellants to 
bring their evidence in the court and get the same recorded.
