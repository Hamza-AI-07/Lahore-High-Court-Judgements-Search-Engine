15.06.2023 Rana Muhammad Luqman Khan, Advocate, for the 
Petitioner. 
 
Mr Khalid Ibn-e-Aziz, Special Prosecutor for ANF. 
 
 
 
 
Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – Through this application, the 
Petitioner seeks post-arrest bail in case FIR No.53/2022 dated 
16.12.2022 registered at Police Station ANF Multan, for an offence 
under sections 9(1)6(c) of Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997. 
2. 
 
Briefly, the prosecution case is that on 16.12.2022 the 
Petitioner was booked on Gulf Air Flight No.GF-789 for travel from 
Multan to Muharraq, Bahrain. He arrived at the ANF desk at Multan 
International Airport at 1350 hours. His luggage was inspected but 
nothing offensive was found. However, he appeared suspicious to Aftab 
Chand/SI who removed him from the queue. During the interrogation, 
he revealed that he had swallowed heroin-packed capsules to smuggle 
the contraband to Bahrain. Aftab Chand/SI arrested him and dispatched 
him to the Nishter Hospital where 118 capsules were recovered from 
him in eight sessions over three days. The total quantity of heroin 
retrieved from them was 590 grams. 
3. 
 
Rana Muhammad Luqman, Advocate, contends that the 
Petitioner was not smuggling anything on Gulf Air Flight No. GF-789. 
The ANF recovered the alleged heroin from another passenger but 
released him, making the Petitioner a scapegoat. According to him, a 
carrier transudes the capsules shortly after he is given a laxative or other 
suitable medicine. The prosecution’s claim that it took three days and 
eight sessions to recover them from the Petitioner casts doubt on its case 
and calls for further inquiry to determine his guilt, entitling him to bail.

The Special Prosecutor for ANF has controverted the above 
contentions. He argues that the Petitioner has not brought any material 
on record which may suggest that the ANF in general, and Aftab 
Chand/SI in particular, had a cause to implicate him in this case falsely. 
As regards the counsel’s argument regarding the time taken to retrieve 
the capsules, the Special Prosecutor states that it lacks substance because 
medical science does not support it.

Drug traffickers transport narcotics and contraband 
psychotropic substances within and beyond borders through various 
means. These include concealing the goods in a large vehicle, luggage or 
clothing. Sometimes they attach the contraband to the outside of their 
bodies with adhesive tape, glue or straps, especially in places such as 
between the cheeks of the buttocks or between fat rolls. Until the early 
1990s, other inconspicuous places, such as the soles of cut-out shoes, 
inside belts, or the rim of a hat, were frequently employed. 
7. 
 
Body packing is another common way to traffic illicit drugs 
with a high street value like heroin. Body packers (referred to as “drug 
mules”) swallow drug packets mostly made with latex sheaths due to 
their impervious quality. Predominantly, latex material includes the 
usage of latex gloves fingers, balloons, or multilayered condoms.1 The 
body packers take antimotility medicines after swallowing multiple 
packets to reduce intestinal motility and avoid passing out the drugs 
before reaching their destination. When they get there, they use 
laxatives, cathartics, or enemas to retrieve the contraband. The total 
amount of drug involved represents a supra-lethal dose. The rupture of 
one or more packets is a risk, resulting in sudden toxicity and overdose. 
Even if the packets do not burst, osmotic seepage across the latex 
wrapping may allow small amounts of drug to enter the bloodstream.2 
The risk of poisoning depends on the quality of the wrapping and the

type of drug ingested. Cocaine, for example, presents a much higher risk 
than heroin because of its high toxicity and lack of a specific antidote.3 
8. 
 
Body stuffing is similar to body packing. It happens when 
people about to be apprehended by law enforcement swallow narcotic 
packets to avoid detection. Sometimes they insert them into the rectum 
or vagina. Body stuffing usually involves much smaller amounts of 
drugs than body packing, but overdose is still a hazard because the drugs 
are typically less securely packaged.4  
9. 
 
Plain abdominal radiographs can detect ingested packets but 
may miss them if the radio density is very close to that of stool, as with 
heroin and cocaine.5 A contrast CT scan or an MRI can reveal more 
packets.6 
10. 
 
Albeit laxatives help retrieve swallowed drugs, as 
adumbrated, law enforcement agencies should avoid administering them 
because, apart from raising legal and ethical issues, they may imperil the 
accused’s life by doing so. They should promptly refer the accused to the 
hospital. 
11. 
 
Doctors follow the conservative approach as much as 
possible in managing body packers and stuffers in hospitals, resorting to 
surgery only when obstructive features develop or intra-abdominal 
packets rupture and cause systemic toxicity. They can clear packets from 
the vagina relatively easily and safely, but attempts to evacuate the 
rectum manually may rupture them, producing systemic toxicity through 
rectal absorption. Packets in the stomach can be retrieved by inducing 
emesis, giving laxatives, or taking other measures to expedite passage 
through the gut.7

Offenders with normal vital signs and normothermia may 
be discharged home after observation up to six hours. However, 
symptoms

packers may need to be hospitalized for several hours or days until all 
the packets are passed. Individuals who come with serious symptoms or 
intestinal obstruction require surgical intervention.8 Some authors 
consider five days as sufficient time for passage of the drug packets, 
while others say that the time varies from 27 hours and seven days.9 
Wong et.al. write that body packers who are managed conservatively 
should be observed in a hospital setting until all packets are evacuated. 
Packet count can be used to indicate a successful procedure. However, 
this method may not be reliable for the offenders who are uncooperative 
and refuse to disclose the exact number of packets in their bodies. 
Alternatively, passing two or three packet-free stools after continuous 
bowel irrigation for 12 hours plus negative abdominal radiology may be 
used as a guide to suggest complete clearance.10

The medical literature cited above negatives Mr Khan’s 
contention that the retrieval process should not take more than a day.

In the present case, as per record, the Petitioner told Aftab 
Chand/SI that he had swallowed 128 capsules. Consequent thereupon, he 
took him to the Emergency Ward of Nishter Hospital Multan on 
16.12.2022 at 07:10 p.m. Subsequently, he was admitted to Medical 
(General) Ward No.12. He passed 118 capsules over the next three days,

The Petitioner was arrested from Multan International 
Airport when he reported for Flight No.GF-789. His airline ticket and 
travel documents are in the police file. The prosecution case is supported 
by the statements of witnesses recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C. and 
corroborated by the Discharge Slip issued by Nishter Hospital and the 
Chemical Analyst’s report. The Petitioner has not presented any 
evidence that the ANF had any motive to implicate him falsely. 
17. 
 
The heroin allegedly recovered from the Petitioner weighed 
590 grams. The offence is punishable by imprisonment for a term which 
may extend to fourteen years but shall not be less than ten years, along 
with a fine up to five hundred thousand rupees but not less than one 
hundred and twenty-five thousand rupees. No case for bail is made out. 
Hence, I have dismissed this application with a short order of even date.
