====== 
 
Through instant petition under Section 497 
Cr.P.C., petitioner Muneeb Riaz has sought post 
arrest bail in case FIR No.57/2024 dated 
29.07.2024, in respect of offence under Section 20, 
21 & 24 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 
2016, registered at Police Station, FIA Cyber Crime 
Circle, Gujranwala. 
2. 
Precisely, the prosecution story was that the 
complainant’s sister was married with the petitioner 
but before Rukhsati, they obtained divorce from him 
through Court due to his bad character. It was 
alleged that the petitioner edited photographs of 
sister and mother of the complainant converting the 
same into their nude pictures, send the same to the 
complainant on his WhatsApp number, created a 
WhatsApp group and threatened them to upload the 
same on social media. Hence, this case was 
registered.  
3. 
I have heard learned counsel for the 
petitioner, learned Law Officers appearing for the 
State assisted by learned counsel for the 
complainant and perused the record.   
4. 
The petitioner is nominated in the crime 
report with the specific role of editing family 
pictures of sister and mother of the complainant and 

Crl. Misc. No.63844-B/2024    
 
 
 
        2 
 
converted the same into nude one and send the same 
to their family with the threat to upload on social 
media for the public at large. The petitioner was 
arrested in this case on the same day i.e. 29.07.2024 
and after inspection, his mobile phone was found 
containing nude edited pictures of sister and mother 
of the complainant, which was taken into possession 
and sent to the lab for forensic analysis and as per 
Initial Technical Analysis Report dated 30.07.2024, 
objectionable and edited content of the victim and 
pornographic material was found in the gallery, 
which were found to have been shared to phone 
number +923179364499 through WhatsApp.  The 
petitioner was found fully involved in this 
occurrence during investigation based on technical 
report as well as other material in the statements of 
the witnesses recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. 
The petitioner has not only put the dignity and 
honour of the ladies at stake but also spoiled their 
lives. 
5. 
Yes, the offence with which the petitioner has 
been charged, does not attract the prohibitory limb 
of Section 497 Cr.P.C. and in the offences not 
falling under the prohibition, the bail is granted as a 
rule in many a cases by the Apex Courts but it has 
never been considered as universal rule and 
compulsion over the Court rather it depends upon 
facts and circumstances of each case.  Here in the 
instant case the petitioner has victimized not only a 
young girl in revenge of taking divorce before 
Rukhsti but also her mother and harmed their 
reputation and privacy explicating their images in 
the forum of edited nude photos and then shared the 
same to their closest and sensitive relative i.e. the 
brother/son.  This fact alone makes case of the 

Crl. Misc. No.63844-B/2024    
 
 
 
        3 
 
petitioner being exceptional and extra ordinary 
circumstance of the case for refusal of bail.  
Reliance is placed on case reported as ‘Muhammad 
Siddique v. Imtiaz Begum and others’ (2002 SCMR 
442) and “Malik Muhammad Tahir ..Vs.. The State 
and another (2022 SCMR 2040)”.   The same view 
was subsequently adopted in case titled ‘Fakhar 
Zaman versus The State and another’ (2023 
P.Cr.L.J 496) and ‘Muhammad Haseeb versus The 
State 
and 
another’ 
(2024 P.Cr.L.J 
1462) 
[Islamabad].  Keeping in view the facts and 
circumstances of the case, the petitioner is not 
entitled to the concession of post arrest bail at this 
early stage.   
 
In view of what has been discussed above, 
this petition is without any merit, the same stands 
dismissed.
