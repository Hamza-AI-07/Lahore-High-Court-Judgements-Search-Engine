By filing Constitution Petition under Article 
199 of the Constitution of Pakistan placed before 
this Court as an objection case, the petitioner has 
called in question the action of private respondent 
Nos. 4 to 9, whereby they have blocked the 
properties of the petitioner and his wife in the 
record maintained by the respondent No. 4, and 
claims that due to the said blockage the petitioner 
and his wife cannot enjoy benefits of the said 
properties or transfer their respective properties to 
any other person. Also seeks direction to official 
respondent Nos. 1 to 3 to proceed against the 
private respondents for the aforesaid action. The 
prayer made in the petition is reproduced below: 
“Under 
the 
circumstances 
and 
forgoing 
submissions, it is therefore, humbly prayed that the 
instant writ petition may kindly be accepted and a 
direction may kindly be issued to the respondents 
No. 1 to 3 to proceed against the respondents No.4 
to 9 for illegally blocking the above said properties 
belonging to the petitioner and his wife. 
It is further prayed that a direction my kindly be 
issued to the respondents to unblock the properties 
described in the plaint owned and possessed by the 
petitioner and his wife in accordance with law in 
the larger interest of justice and fair play. 
It is also prayed that the respondents No.4 to 9 may 
kindly be restrained from interfering in the lawful 
possession over the suit properties belonging to the 
petitioner and his wife in any manner whatsoever.” 
 

 
D. No. 156398 of 2025

2. 
The office has raised objections at Serial 
Nos. 29 and 43 of the objection sheet, which are 
reproduced below: 
“29.  Writ petition cannot be entertained against 
private persons to the extent of Respondent 
Nos. 4 to 9. 
43. 
Alternate remedy of application/petition 
before the concerned Grievance Redressal 
Commissioner has not been availed.” 
 
3. 
The counsel for the petitioner contests the 
above mentioned objections by stating that the 
petitioner’s rights to property have been adversely 
affected therefore direction is required to be issued 
to the respondent Nos. 4 to 9 to unblock the 
properties of the petitioner in the record 
maintained by them, hence this petition is 
maintainable. In the alternate prays that the matter 
in issue may be referred to the official respondent 
Nos. 1 to 3 to proceed against the private 
respondent Nos. 4 to 9 for violating the rights of 
the petitioner.  
4. 
As per the memorandum of parties attached 
with this petition, the respondent No.4/ Bahria 
Town (Pvt.) Ltd. is a private company, which has 
been impleaded through its Chairman, whereas 
respondent Nos. 5 to 9 are its Vice Chairman, 
Chief Executive Officers and Managers. The 
petitioner claims that as he had previously initiated 
public interest litigation against the respondent No. 
4, its chairman became annoyed with the same and 
has blocked the properties of the petitioner in the 
record maintained by the company/respondent No. 
4 in violation of fundamental rights of the 
petitioner. It is also claimed that in addition to the 

 
D. No. 156398 of 2025 
3 
 
above, some suits for redress of grievance of the 
petitioner and his wife have also been filed before 
the civil Court and suit filed by some other person 
is also pending before the said court but the slow 
pace of the same has resulted in filing of the 
instant petition for redress of grievance. It has also 
been claimed that the petitioner approached the 
official respondents for redress of his grievance 
but there is no progress in the same. 
5. 
It is pertinent to mention here that this Court 
is cognizant of the law that constitution petition 
may be filed against a company in certain 
circumstances but for a Constitution petition to be 
maintainable against a company, the said company 
must be performing functions in connection with 
affairs of the Federation. Reliance in this regards 
may be placed on the judgments reported as 
Ramna Pipe and General Mills (Pvt.) Ltd v. Sui 
Northern Gas Pipe Lines (Pvt.) (2004 SCMR 
1274) and Shaikh Muhammad Suleman versus 
Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited 
through its General Manager and another (2019 
PLC (C.S.) 1381 (Sindh).  
6. 
In the present case the respondent No. 4 has 
not been claimed or shown to be performing 
functions in connection with affairs of the 
Federation, rather it is claimed to be a private 
company working for land development for the 
purpose of construction of commercial buildings 
and housing colonies in the private sector and does 
not have controlling share of the Federal or 
Provincial Government, hence constitution petition 
against the same is not maintainable. Reliance has 
been placed on a Division Bench judgment of the 

 
D. No. 156398 of 2025 
4 
 
Sindh High Court, which while discussing the 
question of maintainability of Constitution Petition 
for issuing a direction to an incorporated company 
in Muhammad Saleem versus Chief Controller of 
Billing, K.E.S.C., Karachi and others (2010 YLR 
2946), has held that such petition could not be 
maintained against a company, where Federal or 
Provincial Government did not have therein 
controlling share or interest.  
7. 
In the alternate it has been prayed that the 
matter may be referred to the respondent Nos. 1 to 
3 to proceed against the respondent Nos. 4 to 9 by 
claiming that the petitioner approached the said 
respondents who are not proceeding against the 
aforementioned respondents. Respondent Nos. 1 to 
3 are the Chief Secretary Government of the 
Punjab, Secretary Housing and Physical Planning, 
Lahore and the Director General of Lahore 
Development Authority. Although it has been 
claimed that the said respondents were approached 
for redress of grievance before approaching this 
Court through the Constitution petition, yet no 
document supporting the said assertion has been 
placed on the record and it has also not been 
clarified that under what law remedy was availed 
before the said respondents and whether the said 
remedy, if any availed, was maintainable under the 
law. Hence, presently there was no occasion or 
reason for this Court to issue direction to any of 
the said respondents to proceed against the private 
respondent Nos.4 to 9.  
8. 
In these circumstances, the objection at 
Serial No. 29 of the petition not being 
maintainable against the private respondent Nos. 4 

 
D. No. 156398 of 2025 
5 
 
to 9 is sustained. As regards the office objection at 
Serial No. 43 suffice it to observe that as the 
petitioner has not been able to explain as to how 
and under what law the petitioner approached the 
official respondent Nos. 1 to 3 for redress of 
grievance, therefore, there was no need to 
comment upon the said objection at this premature 
stage for purpose of decision of the other office 
objection and the said question may be addressed 
in some other matter or if raised in this matter at 
any subsequent stage. However, it is observed that 
the decision of these objections would not be a 
hindrance against the petitioner to seek appropriate 
remedy available under the law.   
9. 
The crux of the afore referred observations 
is that where a relief is sought against any private 
company or individual, Constitution Petition 
against the said person would not be maintainable 
unless any remedy is availed against the said 
person before any official forum provided for 
redress of grievance and action or inaction of the 
said forum/authority in pursuit of said remedy for 
redress of said grievance gives a cause of action to 
the petitioner to approach this Court.
