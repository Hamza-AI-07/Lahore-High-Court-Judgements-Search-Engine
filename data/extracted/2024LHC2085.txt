Date of hearing:     23.04.2024.                                                     
Petitioners by: 
M/s. Shafqat Mehmood Chohan and 
Muhammad Suleman Bhatti, Advocates. 
Respondents by: M/s. Malik Muhammad Rafiq Rajwana and 
Muhammad Sohail Iqbal Bhatti, Advocates 
(Applicants of C.M. No.314-C of 2015).   
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.:- This is an 
application under Order VII Rule 11 CPC read with Section 151 CPC 
seeking rejection of the main civil original petition filed under Sections 
290, 291 & 292 of the Companies Ordinance, 1984 (“the Ordinance 
of 1984”), moved by respondents No. 1 to 4, 10 & 12.  
2. 
Learned counsel for respondents / applicants submits that 
petitioners did not fulfill the statutory requirement for filing a petition 
on the ground of oppression and mismanagement, as they did not hold / 
possess twenty percent of the issued share capital of the company in 
terms of Section 290 of the Ordinance of 1984. He adds that 
respondents / applicants filed appeal for revocation of the Succession 
Certificate to the extent of shares and to set-aside the impugned order 
dated 15.10.2014, whereof the order of Succession Certificate was 
suspended as the proceedings to obtain the certificate were defective in 
substance. He maintains that petitioner Sheikh Kamran Shafi, had 
complete knowledge that the shares of his late father had been 

 
2 
 C.O. No.06 of 2014 
& 
C.M. No.314-C of 2015 
 
transferred to respondent No. 1 Sadaqat Shafi on 07.10.2005, but 
concealed this material fact from the Court. He argues that the 
deceased alongwith his family members during his lifetime, transferred 
all of his shares and since then, he and his family became stranger to 
the Company. He contends that even otherwise, the appropriate remedy 
available to petitioners under Section 152 of the Ordinance of 1984 
was to apply to the Court for rectification of register, as rightly held by 
the respondent-SECP vide correspondence dated 13.01.2014, which 
has also attained finality as it was never challenged by petitioners 
before this Court under the relevant provisions of law. In support, he 
has referred to Miss Mahenau Agha v. United Liner Agencies of 
Pakistan Limited and 12 others (PLD 1990 Karachi 198), Messrs 
Shaheen Foundation v. Messrs Capital F.M. (Pvt.) Limited and others 
(2002 CLD 188), Shaukat Ali v. Amin Fabrics Ltd. and 3 others (2008 
CLD 837), Hassan Al-Adawi and another v. Messrs HAMA 
International (Pvt.) Ltd. and 3 others (2009 CLD 1043) and Shaukat 
Ali v. Messrs Bawany Sugar Mills Ltd. 4 others (2009 CLD 497).  
3. 
Contrarily, learned counsel for petitioners contends that 
petitioners possessed 40 percent of the issued share capital of the 
company, holding qualified shares for maintaining the civil original 
petition. However, when confronted with the above submissions of 
learned counsel for respondents / applicants, he requests for conversion 
of the main civil original petition into petition under Section 265 of the 
Ordinance of 1984 seeking investigation of the company through 
Inspector(s). In support, he has relied upon Mrs. Naila Naeem Younus 
and others v. Messrs Indus Services Limited through Chief Executive 
and others (2022 SCMR 1171).  
Learned counsel argues that Court in exercise of civil original 
jurisdiction can pass any order either converting instant petition into 
petition under Section 265 of the Ordinance of 1984 as well as Section 
152 of the Companies Act, 2017 for investigation of the entire aspect 
relating to the transfer of the shares as well as the forms of the 
company as well as for determination of transfer of shares allegedly 

 
3 
 C.O. No.06 of 2014 
& 
C.M. No.314-C of 2015 
 
shown by the respondents / applicants, as the entire controversy is 
relating to the non-submission of instruments regarding alleged 
transfer of the shares even before this Court during the present 
proceedings. In support, he has further referred to Abdul Kareem Khan 
v. Messrs Haroon-ur-Rasheed Textile Mills (Pvt.) Ltd. through Chief 
Executive and 13 others (2015 CLD 719). Lastly, he submits that non 
mentioning of Section 152 does not operate as a bar against power of 
this Court to assume the jurisdiction u/s 152, however, such allegations 
relating to the Section 152 are very much pointed out in the main Civil 
Original Petition. In the end, he submits that he has no objection if 
instant petition is converted into petition under Section 265 of the 
Ordinance of 1984. 
4. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused.  
5. 
Record shows that the main civil original petition has been filed 
under the provisions of Section 290 of the Ordinance of 1984, relevant 
portion whereof is as under:- 
“290.  Application to Court. - (1) If any member or 
members holding not less than twenty per cent of the issued 
share capital of a company, or a creditor or creditors having 
interest equivalent in amount to not less than twenty per cent 
of the paid up capital of the company, complains, or 
complain, or the registrar is of the opinion, that the affairs of 
the company are being conducted, or are likely to be 
conducted, in an unlawful or fraudulent manner, or in a 
manner not provided for in its memorandum, or in a manner 
oppressive to the members or any of the members or the 
creditors or any of the creditors or are being conducted in a 
manner prejudicial to the public interest, such member or 
members or, the creditor or creditors, as the case may be, 
the registrar may make an application to the Court by 
petition for an order under this section.” 
6. 
The above provision authorizes any member or members 
holding not less than twenty per cent of the issued share capital of a 
company, to make an application to the Court. The pre-requisite 
qualification for making petition under said provision of law against 
mismanagement and malpractice in company is that petitioners must 
hold 20% of issued share capital of such company. In absence of any 
proof of such prescribed share capital, a petition cannot be held 

 
4 
 C.O. No.06 of 2014 
& 
C.M. No.314-C of 2015 
 
maintainable under Section 290 of the Companies Ordinance, 
1984. Reliance is placed upon Bhai Azizur Rehman and 5 others v. 
Messrs Ghafur Textile Mills Ltd., Karachi and 19 others (1987 CLC 
577), Mian Khalid Siraj and others v. Khalid Siraj Industries (Pvt.) 
and others (1997 CLC 1220) and Shaukat Ali v. Amin Fabrics Ltd. and 
3 others (2008 CLD 837).  
 
Undoubtedly, it is the stance of respondents / applicants that 
petitioners are not the members of the company as they had already 
transferred all of their shareholdings to the respondents / applicants 
way back in the year 2005, in support whereof, respondents / 
applicants have relied upon Form 29 and Form A for the year 2005, 
submitted in the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, 
Lahore, wherein such change in the shareholding was accordingly 
incorporated, clearly indicating the change / transfer of shareholding, 
whereby the present petitioners are no more the members of the 
company, hence, civil original petition being barred by law, is liable to 
be rejected. Conversely, the stance of petitioners is that respondents 
No.1 & 2 have acted with mala fide and conducted the affairs of the 
Company unlawfully, fraudulently, in breach of their fiduciary duties 
and in violation of mandatory provisions of the Ordinance of 1984; and 
that petitioners have been deprived of their shareholding and 
directorship in an illegal and unlawful manner in Form 29 & Form A. 
7. 
The judicial consensus on when to allow an application under 
Section 265 of the Ordinance for seeking investigation in a company is 
by now settled by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Brothers Steel 
Limited's case (PLD 1995 Supreme Court 320), relevant portion 
whereof is reproduced hereunder:- 
“We are of the considered view that in proceedings under section 
265 of the Ordinance, full-fledged inquiry in the form of a trial, is not 
required to be held nor any formal evidence is to be recorded. 
Needless to observe that before passing the order under section 
265 of the Ordinance, the Court has to only satisfy itself prima 
facie, of course, on the basis of the material placed before it, that a 
case for investigation through an Inspector is called for and it is for 
the Inspector to ascertain and determine the truth or otherwise of 
the allegations during the investigation to be conducted by him 
whereafter he will submit the report to the concerned authority. The 

 
5 
 C.O. No.06 of 2014 
& 
C.M. No.314-C of 2015 
 
matter in fact rests in the discretion of the Court, to be decided after 
following the summary procedure as laid down in section 9 of the 
Ordinance”. 
Further reliance is placed upon Sardar Khan Niazi v. Barex Lahore Ltd. 
(2005 CLD 1670) and Abdul Kareem Khan’s case supra. 
8. 
Needless to observe that mentioning a wrong provision of law in 
a petition would not prevent the Court from exercising its proper 
authority and appropriate jurisdiction vested under the law, keeping in 
view the circumstances of a case. Similarly, it is now well-settled that 
when more than one interpretation is fairly and reasonably possible 
then the interpretation which leads to manifest absurdity or injustice 
must be avoided. Moreover, valuable proprietary rights must not be 
allowed to be negated, unless the law clearly and expressly stipulates 
that such rights would expire with the efflux of time. It is not out of 
place to mention here that Article 24(1) of the Constitution provides 
that 'No person shall be compulsorily deprived of his property save 
in accordance with law'.  Another fundamental right to acquire, hold 
and dispose of property, envisaged in Article 23 of the Constitution, 
would also be vitiated if a person's right to property is discarded in 
such manner that another, who is not entitled thereto, become its 
owner. Reference in this regard is placed upon Mst. Safia Bibi v. Mst. 
Aisha Bibi (1982 SCMR 494), Multan Electric Power Company Ltd. 
through Chief Executive and another v. Muhammad Ashiq and others 
(PLD 2006 Supreme Court 328) and Mrs. Naila Naeem Younus’s 
case supra. 
 
So far as argument of learned counsel for respondents / 
applicants that in the light of correspondence dated 13.01.2014, issued 
by the respondent-SECP, petitioners were required to file petition 
under Section 152 of the Ordinance of 1984 for rectification of register 
is concerned, suffice it to say that petitioners approached this Court by 
way of filing main original petition and this Court is referring the 
matter to Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan for 
investigation in terms of Section 265 of the Ordinance of 1984, 
therefore, this argument has lost its worth. 

 
6 
 C.O. No.06 of 2014 
& 
C.M. No.314-C of 2015 
 
9. 
In view of above discussion, instant application under Order VII 
Rule 11 CPC, filed by respondents / applicants, is allowed in the 
manner that the main petition filed under Sections 290, 291 & 292 of 
the Ordinance of 1984 is not maintainable in its present form and 
therefore in the light of case law cited supra, the same is converted into 
petition under Section 265 of the Ordinance. Resultantly, Securities 
and Exchange Commission of Pakistan is directed to proceed in the 
matter as per law and appoint Inspector(s), within a period of fifteen 
days from the date of receipt of this judgment, upon satisfaction that 
the facts and circumstances warrant investigation of the affairs of 
Messrs Montgomery Flour & General Mills Limited, after issuing 
show cause notice as per law, including the following questions: 
(i) 
Whether there are elements of fraud and misfeasance in 
transfer of shares by petitioners as mentioned in Form-A 
dated 31.10.2005? 
(ii) 
Render findings on petitioners’ letters dated 04.01.2012, 
04.12.2013 and 10.12.2013 addressed to the Securities 
and Exchange Commission of Pakistan. 
 
Needless to add that petitioners are also entitled to avail alternate 
remedy available to them under the law in addition to the remedy 
provided in Section 265 of the Ordinance of 1984. Office is directed 
to immediately send a copy of this judgment to the worthy Chairman 
Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, to do the needful as 
per law, as directed hereinabove and conclude the proceedings within 
a period of ninety days from the date of receipt of certified copy of 
this judgment, under intimation to this Court through Deputy 
Registrar (Judicial) of this Bench.
