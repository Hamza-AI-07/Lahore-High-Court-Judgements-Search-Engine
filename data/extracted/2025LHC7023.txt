Following questions of law are placed 
before us for determination, statedly arisen out of 
order of the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue, 
Multan 
Bench, 
Multan 
(“Tribunal”) 
dated 
12.12.2023. 
“i)  
Whether in the facts & circumstances of the 
case, the learned Appellate Tribunal was 
justified to hold that the taxpayer is entitled 
to claim the initial allowance under section 
23(5) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, on 
the aircraft which is not related to business 
activity? 
ii)  
Whether in the facts & circumstances of the 
case, the learned ATIR was justified to 
disallow the addition of deduction claimed 
u/s 60B of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, 
contrary to the express provision of section 
34(5) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001? 
  
2. 
Primary contentions by learned counsel for 
applicant department are that the Tribunal had 
misconstrued provisions of Sections 34(5), 60B 
and 23(5) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 
(“The Ordinance”). Adds that Tribunal erred in law 

ITR No.23/2024 
                       2 
 
in holding that section 34(5) of the Ordinance is 
not attracted. Submits that how an aircraft or any 
part thereof be treated as eligible depreciable 
asset when it was not established that it was used 
for the business purposes only. Elaborates that no 
evidence was produced to bring aircraft within the 
ambit of an depreciable asset, required to be 
established for claiming depreciation, let alone 
meeting eligibility for the purposes of initial 
allowance.  
3. 
Conversely, with reference to first question 
of law, learned counsel for respondent taxpayer 
submits that Aircraft and parts thereof were 
acquired and used for business and same qualify 
as an “eligible depreciable assets” in terms of 
section 23(5) of the Ordinance. Adds that findings 
recorded by the Tribunal that aircraft is employed 
for the purpose of business are conclusive and 
require no interference. On second question, it is 
argued that Workers Participation Fund (WPF) is a 
deductible  allowance, which is adjustable against 
gross income and not against the head income 
from business. Explains that WPF is not an 
expenditure and not classifiable as liability in 
terms of section 34(5) of the Ordinance.

                       3 
 
4. 
While rebutting the argument, learned 
counsel for applicant department submits that 
respondent taxpayer had provisioned WPF as 
expenditure in annual income tax returns 
submitted during relevant years and now 
respondent cannot renegade from its principled 
position. 
Opinion regarding first question: 
5. 
We examined the findings recorded by the 
Tribunal, which are found superficial and 
perfunctory, wherein no analysis was found with 
supporting evidence that aircraft has been used 
for business purposes – mere import details and 
production of goods declarations would not meet 
the requirements of sections 22 and 23 of the 
Ordinance. In absence of such determination no 
entitlement for initial allowance could be claimed. 
We asked learned counsel, who conceded that 
flight log of the aircraft was not provided to show 
details of flights, purpose thereof, identity of the 
passengers travelling and purpose of travel. For 
the purposes of seeking initial allowance, it is 
essential for the taxpayer to substantiate that 
aircraft is used for the purpose of business – even 
partly use for business and partly other use would 

ITR No.23/2024 
                       4 
 
attract scrutiny in terms of sub-section (3) of 
section 
22 
of 
the 
Ordinance. 
In 
these 
circumstances, we conclude that determination 
was deficient and not carried on in accordance 
with the benchmark requirements prescribed 
under section 23 of the Ordinance. We remand 
the matter for re-determination of claim of initial 
allowance, afresh. Question stood answered 
accordingly. 
Opinion regarding second question: 
6. 
It is not disputed that Workers Participation 
Fund (WPF) was provisioned for the relevant tax 
year, which was claimed as expenditure. Liability 
was not paid, which is condition precedent for 
claiming deduction in terms of section 60B of the 
Ordinance. Conventionally, companies establish 
fund in the accounts, aligning it with accrual-
based accounting system of expenditure and 
liabilities, irrespective of the fact that payment is 
made at later stage. This position is manifested 
from the return of income provided and factum 
thereof was not disputed by learned counsel for 
respondent. We dismiss assertion that it was a 
mistake and continued year after year. In terms of 
section 34(5) of the Ordinance,  liability, to which 

ITR No.23/2024 
                       5 
 
deduction relates, was not paid within three years 
of the end of the tax year in which deduction was 
allowed, and unpaid liability had to be paid before 
same is chargeable to tax under the income from 
business category in the first year following the 
end of three years. Learned counsel for the 
respondent states that part of the liability was 
paid subsequently but benefit of sub-section (6) of 
section 34 of the Ordinance was not extended and 
nor reconciled. 
7. 
In view of the above, we set aside the 
determination by the Tribunal, regarding the 
second question, and hold that non-payment of 
liability of WPF and provisioning thereof attracts 
section 34(5) of the Ordinance. Judgment in the 
case of “COMMISSIONER INLAND REVENUE v. 
Messrs RIAZ BOTTLERS (PVT.) LTD. (Now Lottee 
Akhtar Beverages (Pvt.) Ltd.” (2024 SCMR 684) 
was in the context of section 25(c) of erstwhile 
Income Tax Ordinance, 1979, which has no 
applicability. 
Question 
stood 
answered 
accordingly in favour of the department. We 
remand the matter to the Tribunal to the extent 
of determination that whether taxpayer is entitled 
to any benefit under sub-section (6) of section 34 
of the Ordinance.

8. 
This reference application is allowed in 
aforesaid terms. Matter, to the extent of factual 
aspect of the issues under reference, is remanded, 
though 
questions 
of 
law, 
concerning 
interpretation of relevant provisions of the 
Ordinance, stood answered accordingly.  
9. 
Office to send copy of this order under the 
seal of the Court to the Appellate Tribunal
