Mr. Abdul Khaliq Safrani, Advocate, assisted by M/s

Advocates, for the Petitioner. 
 
Mr. Rahat Majeed, Assistant District Public Prosecutor, with 
Amjad/ASI. 
 
Sh. Sajid Mehmood, Advocate, for Respondent No.1. 
 
 
 
 
Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – The Petitioner alleges that on 
28.9.2023, around 10.00 a.m., when he was on his way home in Chak 
No.77/RB, Tehsil Jaranwala, Respondent No.1 and his associate, Shahid 
Nadeem, attacked him. During the incident, Respondent No.1 struck him 
with a spade on his left arm, and Shahid threw brickbats at him, injuring 
his back and left thumb. This attack resulted in a fracture to the 
Petitioner‟s left arm. The Medical Officer did not observe any injuries on 
the back or thumb but determined the injury to the arm as Jurh Ghair 
Jaifa Munaqqilah. The Petitioner lodged FIR No.1952/2023 dated 
5.10.2023 at Police Station Khurrianwala, District Faisalabad, against 
Respondent No.1 and Shahid for offences under section 337-F(vi) and 34 
PPC regarding the occurrence. 
2. 
 
Admittedly, Respondent No.1 was a juvenile at the time of 
the alleged incident. He was under 18, with the date of birth recorded as 
26.2.2006. He applied for his pre-arrest bail. The Additional Sessions 
Judge, Jaranwala, accepted his plea by an order dated 6.11.2023 on the 
ground that the offence under section 337-F(vi)/34 PPC is to be treated as 
bailable under section 6(3) of the Juvenile Justice System Act 2018 
(JJSA). 
3. 
 
The Petitioner contends that the Additional Sessions Judge 
has misconstrued section 6(3) of the JJSA. Arrest or detention is a

pre-condition for the applicability of this provision. A “major offence” is 
considered bailable when a juvenile is arrested or detained and approaches 
the court for bail. According to him, section 6(3) cannot be invoked for 
the purpose of pre-arrest bail. Through this application under section 
497(5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 (hereinafter referred to as 
the “Code” or “Cr.P.C.”), he seeks cancellation of the pre-arrest bail of 
Respondent No.1.

The juvenile justice system is a specialized legal framework 
designed to address the unique needs and circumstances of young 
individuals who come into conflict with the law.1 It prioritizes 
rehabilitation, reintegration, and the best interests of the child.2 It 
contrasts with the adult criminal justice system, which primarily focuses 
on punishment and deterrence.  
6. 
 
The origins of the juvenile justice system can be traced back 
to the late 19th century, with the establishment of the first juvenile court 
in Chicago in 1899. This system is rooted in the concept of  
parens patriae, which grants the State the authority to intervene on behalf 
of the child‟s welfare when necessary.3 This principle underscores the 
State‟s responsibility to protect and nurture young people, even when they 
engage in delinquent behaviour. Over time, the juvenile justice system has 
evolved in response to changing societal attitudes, legal reforms, and 
research on adolescent development.4 The shift towards a more 
rehabilitative and therapeutic approach gained momentum in the mid-20th 
century, with landmark U.S. Supreme Court decisions such as  
In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1 (1967), and In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358 (1970).5 
These decisions affirmed the rights of juvenile offenders to due process, 
including the right to notice, legal representation, and protection against 
self-incrimination.

International law recognizes the importance of protecting the 
rights of juveniles in conflict with law. It aims to strike a balance between 
holding children accountable for their actions and providing them with the 
support and guidance they need to become productive members of 
society. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 
(UNCRC), adopted in 1989, is the most comprehensive international 
treaty addressing children‟s rights, including those in the aforementioned 
category. In General Comment No.24 (2019),6 the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child7 (the “CRC Committee”) has stated: 
 
“2. 
Children differ from adults in their physical and psychological 
development. Such differences constitute the basis for the recognition 
of lesser culpability, and for a separate system with a differentiated, 
individualized approach. Exposure to the criminal justice system has 
been demonstrated to cause harm to children, limiting their chances of 
becoming responsible adults. 
“3. 
The Committee acknowledges that preservation of public safety 
is a legitimate aim of the justice system, including the child justice 
system. However, States Parties should serve this aim subject to their 
obligations to respect and implement the principles of child justice as 
enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child ...” 
8. 
 
Article 37 of the UNCRC contains fundamental principles 
regarding child detention. It mandates that States Parties take measures to 
ensure the following: (a) No child should endure torture or any form of 
cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. Furthermore, 
individuals who are under eighteen years of age should not be subjected to 
capital punishment or life imprisonment without the possibility of release 
for their offences. (b) No child should be deprived of their freedom 
unlawfully or arbitrarily. A child‟s apprehension, confinement, or 
incarceration must comply with legal provisions and should only occur as 
a last resort and for the shortest appropriate duration. (c) Every child 
deprived of liberty should be treated with dignity and humanity. They 
should be separated from adults unless it is deemed in their best interest 
not to do so. They should have the right to maintain contact with their 
family through correspondence and visits, unless extraordinary 
circumstances warrant otherwise. (d) Every child deprived of liberty

should have prompt access to legal and other necessary assistance. They 
should also have the right to contest the legality of their detention before a 
court or another competent, impartial authority, with a guarantee of swift 
resolution. In General Comment No.24 (2019), supra, the CRC 
Committee has stated: 
“86. 
… Pretrial detention should not be used except in the most 
serious cases, and even then only after community placement has been 
carefully considered. Diversion at the pretrial stage reduces the use of 
detention, but even where the child is to be tried in the child justice 
system, non-custodial measures should be carefully targeted to restrict 
the use of pretrial detention. 
“87. 
The law should clearly state the criteria for the use of pretrial 
detention, which should be primarily for ensuring appearance at the 
court proceedings and if the child poses an immediate danger to others. 
If the child is considered a danger (to himself or herself or others) child 
protection measures should be applied. Pretrial detention should be 
subject to regular review and its duration limited by law. All actors in 
the child justice system should prioritize cases of children in pretrial 
detention. 
“88. 
In application of the principle that deprivation of liberty should 
be imposed for the shortest appropriate period of time, States Parties 
should provide regular opportunities to permit early release from 
custody, including police custody, into the care of parents or other 
appropriate adults. There should be discretion to release with or without 
conditions, such as reporting to an authorized person or place. The 
payment of monetary bail should not be a requirement, as most children 
cannot pay and because it discriminates against poor and marginalized 
families. Furthermore, where bail is set it means that there is a 
recognition in principle by the court that the child should be released, 
and other mechanisms can be used to secure attendance.” 
9. 
 
Article 40 of the UNCRC emphasizes the right of every child 
to be treated in a manner consistent with the promotion of their sense of 
dignity and worth, which reinforces their respect for human rights and the 
fundamental freedoms of others. The Article stipulates that children 
accused of breaking the law should only be charged for acts that were 
illegal when committed, and they must be presumed innocent until proven 
guilty. It mandates prompt notification of charges, access to legal 
assistance, and a fair trial conducted by an impartial authority. The Article 
also prohibits coercion to confess guilt and ensures the right to challenge 
evidence and have decisions reviewed. It emphasizes the need to respect 
children‟s privacy throughout legal proceedings. Furthermore, the Article 
promotes the establishment of specialized laws and procedures for 
juvenile 
offenders 
and 
suggests 
non-judicial 
approaches 
when

appropriate, provided human rights and legal safeguards are upheld. 
Lastly, it advocates for various interventions, including counselling and 
education programs, to address the well-being of children involved in 
legal matters proportionately to their circumstances and the severity of the 
offence. In General Comment No.24 (2019), supra, the CRC Committee 
has stated: “Evidence shows that the prevalence of crime committed by 
children tends to decrease after the adoption of systems in line with these 
principles.” 
10. 
 
Besides UNCRC, several other international instruments 
provide guidance and standards for the treatment of juveniles in the 
justice system.8 
11. 
 
Pakistan ratified UNCRC on 12.11.1990. Thus, as a part of 
its international commitments, it is obligated to take special measures to 
protect the child and safeguard the child‟s best interest, including those in 
conflict with the law. In Khawar Kiyani v. The State and others  
(PLD 2022 SC 551), the Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled that the juvenile 
justice system in our country also has its “ideological roots” in the 
Constitution of 1973. It highlighted that Article 25(3) of the Constitution 
allows the State to make special provisions for safeguarding children, 
even if they result in discrimination against adults (reverse 
discrimination9). Additionally, Article 35 mandates the State to protect 
children. 
12. 
 
In compliance with the above-mentioned constitutional 
mandate and for the fulfilment of its international obligation, Pakistan 
enacted the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance in 2000, which was later 
                                                 
8 These include:  Further international juvenile justice standards and norms are contained in the United Nations Standard 
Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice (the Beijing Rules), the United Nations Rules for the 
Protection of Juveniles Deprived of Their Liberty (the Havana Rules), the United Nations Guidelines for the Prevention 
of Juvenile Delinquency (the Riyadh Guidelines), the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for Non-custodial 
Measures (the Tokyo Rules), the Guidelines for Action on Children in the Criminal Justice System (the Vienna 
Guidelines), the United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Restorative Justice Programmes in Criminal Matters, the 
Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, the United Nations Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners 
and Non-custodial Measures for Women Offenders (the Bangkok Rules), and the United Nations Principles and 
Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems. The General Comments of the Committee on the Rights 
of the Child (CRC Committee) must also be mentioned as sources of guidance and recommendations to States Parties in 
their efforts to establish an administration of juvenile justice in compliance with the CRC. (Source: Justice in Matters

9 Reverse discrimination is a term for discrimination against members of a dominant or majority group in favour of 
members of a minority or historically disadvantaged group etc.

replaced by the Juvenile Justice System Act in 2018 (JJSA). It rests on the 
concept of “best interest of the child”, which according to section 2(a) of 
the Act, means “the basis for any decision taken regarding the child to 
ensure fulfilment of his basic rights and needs, identity, social well-being, 
physical, emotional and psychological development.” 
13. 
 
Truly speaking, “the best interests of the child” is a dynamic 
and continually evolving concept. General Comment No.14 (2013)10 
provides a framework for assessing it in any given situation. The CRC 
Committee has stated that it has three dimensions: (a) a substantive right, 
(b) a fundamental interpretative legal principle, and (c) a rule of 
procedure. The “substantive right” ensures that children have their best 
interests evaluated and given paramount consideration in decision-making 
processes, applicable to individual children, specific groups, or children in 
general, as Article 3, paragraph 1 of UNCRC mandates. As a 
“fundamental interpretative legal principle”, it dictates that if a legal 
provision is open to more than one interpretation, the construction which 
most effectively serves the child‟s best interests should be chosen, guided 
by the rights enshrined in the Convention and its Optional Protocols. As a 
“rule of procedure”, it mandates that whenever a decision is to be made 
that will affect a specific child, an identified group of children or children 
in general, the decision-making process must include an evaluation of the 
possible impact (positive or negative) of the decision on the child or 
children concerned. Assessing and determining the best interests of the 
child requires procedural guarantees. The Committee emphasizes that in 
criminal proceedings, the best interests principle applies to children in 
conflict (i.e. alleged, accused or recognized as having infringed) or in 
contact (as victims or witnesses) with the law, as well as children affected 
by the situation of their parents in conflict with the law. The CRC 
Committee underlines that the traditional objectives of criminal justice, 
such as repression or retribution, must give way to rehabilitation and 
restorative justice objectives when dealing with child offenders.

Clause (b) of section 2 of JJSA defines “child”, for the 
purpose of the Act, as a person who has not attained the age of eighteen 
years. Clause (h) states that “juvenile” means a child who may be dealt 
with for an offence in a manner which is different from an adult. 
According to clause (i) of the aforesaid section, “juvenile offender” means 
a child who is alleged to have committed or who has been found to have 
committed an offence.” Consequently, the JJSA applies to individuals 
under eighteen years old. When determining the juvenility of an accused, 
the date of the crime is crucial, not his age at the time. An accused has to 
be dealt with under the law as applicable on the date when the crime is 
committed.11 
15. 
 
The JJSA classifies offences into three categories: heinous, 
major, and minor. According to section 2(g) of the Act, “heinous offence” 
means an offence which is serious, gruesome, brutal, sensational in 
character or shocking to public morality and which is punishable under 
the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 (PPC) or any other law for the time being 
in force with death or imprisonment for life or imprisonment for more 
than seven years with or without fine. Section 2(m) states that “major 
offence” means an offence for which punishment under the PPC or any 
other law for the time being in force is more than three years and up to 
seven years imprisonment with or without a fine. Section 2(o) states that 
“minor offence” means an offence for which the maximum punishment 
under the PPC or any other law for the time being in force is 
imprisonment for up to three years with or without a fine. 
16. 
 
Section 5 of the JJSA stipulates the procedure to be followed 
when a juvenile offender is arrested. Section 6 of the Act provides for his 
release on bail during the pendency of the case against him. It is 
reproduced below for ease of reference: 
6. Release of a Juvenile on bail.– (1) Notwithstanding anything 
contained in the Code [of Criminal Procedure 1898], a juvenile accused 
of bailable offence shall, if already not released under section 496 of 
the Code, be released by the Juvenile Court on bail with or without 
surety unless it appears that there are reasonable grounds for believing 
that the release of such juvenile may bring him in association with 
criminals or expose him to any other danger. In this situation the

juvenile shall be placed under the custody of a suitable person or 
Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre under the supervision of probation 
officer. The juvenile shall not under any circumstances be kept in a 
police station under police custody or jail in such cases. 
(2) 
The Juvenile Court shall, in a case where a juvenile is not 
released under subsection (1), direct the police for tracing guardian of 
such juvenile and where guardian of such juvenile is traced out, the 
Juvenile Court may immediately handover custody of the juvenile to 
his guardian. 
(3) 
Where a juvenile is arrested or detained for commission of a 
minor or a major offence for the purpose of this Act, he shall be treated 
as if he was accused of commission of a bailable offence. 
(4) 
Where a juvenile of more than sixteen years of age is arrested or 
detained for a heinous offence, he may not be released on bail if the 
Juvenile Court is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds to 
believe that such juvenile is involved in commission of a heinous 
offence. 
(5) 
Where the Juvenile Court is of the opinion that the delay in the 
trial of a juvenile has not been occasioned by an act or omission of such 
juvenile or any other person acting on his behalf or in exercise of any 
right or privilege under any law for the time being in force, such 
juvenile shall be released on bail if he has been detained for a 
continuous period exceeding six months and whose trial has not been 
completed. 
17. 
 
Section 6(1) of the JJSA provides that a juvenile accused of a 
bailable offence shall be released by the Juvenile Court on bail unless it 
appears that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the release of 
such juvenile may bring him in association with criminals or expose him 
to any other danger. In this situation, the juvenile shall be placed under 
the custody of a suitable person or Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre under 
the supervision of a probation officer. The juvenile shall not under any 
circumstances be kept in a police station under police custody or jail in 
such cases. In Alam Zeb and another v. The State and others  
(PLD 2014 SC 760), the Supreme Court held that bail is to be granted to 
the accused as a matter of right in a case involving a bailable offence. 
18. 
 
Section 6(3) of the Act provides for treating the “minor 
offences” and “major offences” as bailable. Section 6(4) provides that 
where a juvenile is more than sixteen years of age and is arrested or 
detained for a heinous offence, he may be released on bail if the Juvenile 
Court is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds to believe that 
such juvenile is involved in the commission of a heinous offence. Even in 
cases involving heinous offences under section 6(5), the juvenile must be 
released on bail if he is under detention for a continuous period exceeding 

Crl. Misc. No.78015/CB/2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9 
 
six months, his trial is not completed, and he is not responsible for the 
delay. The said period is to be counted from the date of the juvenile‟s 
arrest.12  
19. 
 
In Khawar Kiyani, the Supreme Court observed that section 
6 of the JJSA actualizes Article 37(b) of the UNCRC. 
20. 
 
Section 23 of the JJSA provides that the provisions of this 
Act shall have overriding effect notwithstanding anything contained in 
any other law for the time being in force. This means that if there are any 
inconsistencies or contradictions between the JJSA and other existing 
laws, the regulations specified within the JJSA will supersede and take 
precedence. Generally, if the provisions of the JJSA do not explicitly 
address a particular matter or are not inconsistent with the general law, i.e. 
the Code of Criminal Procedure Code, the latter may apply. Section 5(2) 
Cr.P.C. also supports this view. It provides that all offences under any law 
other than the PPC shall be investigated, inquired into, tried, and 
otherwise dealt with according to the provisions of the Code, but subject 
to any enactment for the time being in force regulating the manner or 
place of investigating, inquiring into, trying or otherwise dealing with 
such offence. 
21. 
 
The JJSA does not explicitly mention anticipatory bail. 
However, following the legal principle discussed in the previous 
paragraph, this omission does not automatically prevent juveniles from 
pursuing it under the Code. A juvenile at risk of arrest can seek pre-arrest 
bail under section 498 Cr.P.C. This provision remains applicable and 
available to such offenders. 
22. 
 
In the present case, Respondent No.1 is admittedly a juvenile 
and is accused of an offence under sections 337-F(vi)/34 PPC. The said 
offence is classified as a “major offence” under the JJSA. It is punishable 
with Daman and imprisonment of either description for a term which may 
extend to seven years as Ta’zir. The prison sentence is in the court‟s 
discretion. This offence is non-bailable according to Schedule II of the 
Code. The decision to grant bail hinges on the nature of the offence.

Crl. Misc. No.78015/CB/2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10 
 
Under the Code, bail is granted as a matter of right in bailable offences 
but becomes subject to the court‟s discretion in cases of non-bailable 
offences. 
23. 
 
As adumbrated, section 6(3) of the JJSA mandates that it is 
to be treated as bailable. The Petitioner‟s contention is that the benefit of 
section 6(3) cannot be extended to the juvenile if he applies for pre-arrest 
bail. He argues that the words “arrested or detained” in section 6(3) 
denote that a juvenile must be in custody before section 6(3) can be 
applied to him. To put it differently, the benefit of this provision can only 
be granted to the juvenile when he seeks post-arrest bail. 
24. 
 
The JJSA can be classified as both remedial and beneficial 
legislation. On the one hand, the Act aims to remedy deficiencies within 
the juvenile justice system by establishing procedures and standards for 
the treatment of juvenile offenders. It seeks to ensure that juveniles are 
treated fairly, provided with necessary support and services, and given 
opportunities for rehabilitation and reintegration into society. In this 
sense, it is a “remedial legislation”. On the other hand, by prioritizing the 
rights and rehabilitation of juvenile offenders, the Act contributes to their 
overall well-being and aims to prevent further harm or injustice. 
Therefore, it can also be considered a form of “beneficial legislation”. 
25. 
 
Notably, the JJSA also aligns with the concept of “social 
welfare legislation” because of its broader implications for promoting the 
well-being of juveniles and society as a whole. 
26. 
 
In interpreting the JJSA, courts would begin by examining 
the Act‟s plain and ordinary meaning and text. However, where there is an 
ambiguity, they may apply the “mischief rule” or the “purposive 
approach” to determine the legislative intent. Coke elucidated the 
mischief rule in Heydon’s case13 as follows: 
 
“It was resolved by them that for the sure and true interpretation of all 
statutes in general be they penal or beneficial, restrictive or enlarging of 
the common law...the obligation of all the judges is always to make 
such construction as shall suppress the mischief, and advance the 
remedy, and to suppress subtle inventions and evasions for continuance 
of the mischief, and pro privato commodo, and to add force and life to

11 
 
the cure and remedy, according to the true intent of the makers of the 
Act, pro bono publico. This rule is popularly known as the „mischief 
rule‟. In a broader sense, this may be understood as the purposive 
construction of statutes.” 
27. 
 
Bennion on Statutory Interpretation states: “Parliament is 
presumed to intend that in construing an Act the court, by advancing the 
remedy which is indicated by the words of the Act for the mischief being 
dealt with, and the implications arising from those words, should aim to 
further every aspect of the legislative purpose. A construction promoting 
the remedy Parliament provided to cure a particular mischief is now 
known as a purposive construction … The purpose or object of Parliament 
in passing an Act (the legislative purpose) is to provide an appropriate 
remedy to serve as a cure for the mischief with which the Act deals. The 
legislative purpose of a particular enactment contained in an Act is to be 
arrived at accordingly. In particular, it is deemed to be to remedy the 
mischief to which that enactment is directed.”14 According to Lord 
Wilberforce, consideration of the purpose of an enactment is always a 
legitimate part of the process of interpretation.15 Lord Diplock said, 
“ „Purpose‟ connotes an intention by some person to achieve a result 
desired by him”.16 In Pepper v. Hart (1993) 1 All ER 42, 50, Lord 
Griffith observed: 
 
“The days have long passed when the courts adopted a strict 
constructionist view of interpretation which required them to adopt the 
literal meaning of the language. The courts now adopt a purposive 
approach to give effect to the true purpose of legislation.” 
28. 
 
Remedial and beneficial statutes are liberally construed, and 
in cases of doubt or ambiguity, the construction that will best advance the 
objectives of the statute is adopted. N.S. Bindra’s Interpretation of 
Statutes states: 
 
“When the legislative intention aims to provide benefit, then the courts 
read the text differently from how they read it when the intention is to 
effect deprivation ... It is the duty of the court to interpret a provision, 
especially a beneficial provision, liberally so as to give it a wide 
meaning rather than a restrictive meaning which would negate the very 
object of the rule. A beneficial piece of legislation has to be construed 
in its true perspective so as to fructify the legislative intent underlying

its enactment. When two views are possible on the applicability of a 
legislation, the one which furthers the legislative intent should be 
preferred to the one which frustrates it.”17

Given the above, courts should adopt a holistic and purposive 
approach while interpreting the JJSA, considering its remedial objectives 
in reforming the juvenile justice system and its beneficial aims in 
promoting the well-being of juvenile offenders and society. In doing so, 
they should be guided by the above international standards and principles.

When construing section 6 of the JJSA, courts would also 
consider the principle of lenity, which suggests that they should lean 
towards the interpretation favouring the accused. In Province of Punjab 
and another v. Muhammad Rafique and others (PLD 2018 SC 178), the 
Supreme Court stated: 
“It is almost settled by now that whenever a penal statute requires 
interpretation, then it shall be so interpreted, which favours the accused 
person and not the prosecution or the State. Two interpretations of a 
statute should be interpreted in such manner that the interpretation 
favouring the accused should be adopted.”

As adumbrated, the JJSA marks a paradigm shift in the 
treatment of juvenile offenders within the criminal justice system. It 
modifies and amends the law relating to them by focusing on the disposal 
of their cases through diversion and facilitiating their rehabilitation. 
Recognizing their unique vulnerabilities and the necessity for support, it 
provides that all offences except heinous ones are to be treated as bailable. 
However, the practical application of section 6(3) of the JJSA has raised a 
critical issue. It would be absurd to say that an offence would be 
considered bailable when a juvenile applies for post-arrest bail and 
otherwise if he approaches the court for anticipatory bail. In other words, 
the bail process should not be contingent upon whether a juvenile is 
seeking post-arrest bail or anticipatory bail because it would introduce an 
arbitrary distinction that runs counter to the overarching objectives of the 
JJSA. A juvenile‟s eligibility for bail should be determined based on the 
nature of the offence and the specific circumstances of the case rather than 
the procedural mechanism through which bail is sought.

The above interpretation of section 6(3) of the JJSA aligns 
closely with the principles of the best interests of the child, rehabilitation, 
and fairness as outlined in General Comments No. 14 and 24 of the CRC 
Committee. Furthermore, it effectively implements the principle that a 
child‟s arrest, detention, or imprisonment should be used only as a 
measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time. 
33. 
 
The Additional Sessions Judge has rightly extended the 
benefit of section 6(3) of JJSA to Respondent No.1 while considering his 
plea for pre-arrest bail. This application has no merits and is, therefore, 
dismissed.
