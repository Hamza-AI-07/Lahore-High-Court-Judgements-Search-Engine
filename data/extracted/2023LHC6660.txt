MUHAMMAD AMJAD RAFIQ, J:- This criminal appeal strikes 
against the order dated 08.11.2023 passed by learned Additional Sessions 
Judge, Bahawalpur, whereby the appellants were convicted under section 
180 PPC and sentenced to undergo fifteen days’ simple imprisonment along 
with fine of Rs.500/-, each. in default to further undergo simple 
imprisonment for three days. 
2. 
The learned counsel for the appellants contends that a private 
complaint tilted “Ghulam Muhammad versus Kashif Nawaz, etc.” under 
sections 302/34 PPC was pending against the appellants in which on 
08.11.2023 charge was framed against them and learned Additional 
Sessions Judge called upon them to sign the charge sheet, appellants sought 
some time for availability of their learned counsel so that in his presence 
charge sheet could be signed but the learned Additional Sessions Judge 
considering it contempt of his lawful authority, which is an offence under 
section 180 PPC, proceeded to pass the aforesaid conviction and sentence. 
Further submits that obtaining signatures of the accused on the charge sheet 
is not the legal requirement and, in this respect, has placed reliance on the 
case reported as “GHULAM RASOOL versus THE STATE” (1992 MLD 
2455). Adds that learned Judge could not have passed the sentence under 

 
Criminal Appeal No.531/2023. 
2 
 
section 180 PPC directly for a period as aforesaid, thus, he prayed for 
acceptance of the appeal and setting aside the impugned conviction and 
sentence. 
 
3. 
The learned Prosecutors on the other hand submit that the appeal is 
not competent pursuant to section 413 of Cr.P.C. (the Code) because it is a 
petty sentence, against which no appeal is provided. Further submit that 
section 195 of the Code formalizes the process of trial in this case which 
has been followed by the learned Judge, therefore, prayed for dismissal of 
the appeal. 
4. 
Heard. 
5. 
Before proceeding further, let’s see what section 180 PPC says, it is 
as under; 
Refusing to sign statement: Whoever refuses to sign any statement made by 
him, when required to sign that statement by a public servant legally competent 
to require that he shall sign that statement, shall be punished with simple 
imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine which 
may extend to one thousand, or with both. 
It has been observed that wherever the law requires obtaining the signatures 
of any person, it has specifically been prescribed under the law. The case 
reported as “THE STATE versus SARDAR AHMED” (PLD 1967 Karachi 75) 
throws light that according to provisions of sections 154 and 200 of the 
Code the complainant is required to sign the statement, whereas, sections 
342 and 364 of the Code require obtaining the signatures of the accused but 
there is no such requirement under sections 243 or 265-E of the Code. 
Obtaining signatures of the accused on the charge sheet is not the legal 
requirement but it is in practice since long, therefore, obtaining signatures 
on the plea of an accused plainly conforms to his admission to charge or 
otherwise, therefore, it cannot be considered as an illegality; however, if 
the accused does not sign the charge sheet he cannot be convicted under 
section 180 of PPC. Reliance in this respect is placed on the case cited supra 
as “THE STATE versus SARDAR AHMED” (PLD 1967 Karachi 75).  
6.     The argument of learned Prosecutors that procedure under section 195 
of the Code authorizes the learned Judge to convict the accused there and 
then, is repelled in the light of legal provisions under Sections 480 and 482 

 
Criminal Appeal No.531/2023. 
3 
 
of the Code, specially legislated for the purpose to deal with contempt of 
lawful authority of the Court. Section 480 of the Code reads as under: - 
“480. Procedure in certain cases of contempt.- (1) When any such offence as 
is described in section 175, section 178, section 179, section 180 or section 228 
of the Pakistan Penal Code, (Act KLV of 1860) is committed in the view or 
presence of any Civil, Criminal or Revenue Court, the Court may cause the 
offender  to be detained in custody and at any time before the rising of the Court 
on the same day may, if it thinks fit, take cognizance of the offence and sentence 
the offender to fine, not exceeding two hundred rupees, and, in default of 
payment, to simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to one month, 
unless such fie be sooner paid.” 
                                                                                    (Emphasis supplied)  
 
If the court considers that any disobedience to his order has been committed 
pursuant to sections mentioned therein then the offender can be imposed a 
fine of Rs.200/- only after following the procedure under section 481 of  the 
Code but if the Court considers that more severe sentence should be 
imposed then of course the Court shall send the complaint to the Magistrate 
for the purpose of trial under section 482 of the Code, which is reproduced 
as under; 
 
482. Procedure where Court considers that case should not be dealt with 
under Section 480: (1) If the Court in any case considers that a person accused 
of any of the offences referred to in Section 480 and committed in its view or 
presence should be imprisoned otherwise than in default of payment of fine, or 
that a fine exceeding two hundred rupees should be imposed upon him, or such 
Court is for any other reason of opinion that the case should not be disposed of 
under Section 480, such Court, after recording the facts constituting the offence 
and the statement of the accused as hereinbefore provided, may forward the 
case to a Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the same, and may require 
security to be given for the appearance of such accused person before such 
Magistrate, or if sufficient security is not given, shall forward such person in 
custody to such Magistrate.  
 
(2) The Magistrate, to whom any case is forwarded under this section, shall 
proceed to hear the complaint against the accused person in manner 
hereinbefore provided. 
  
Whereas, in this case it has not been done, rather the learned Additional 
Sessions Judge has directly passed the conviction and sentence for 15 days’ 
imprisonment, though he was not authorized under section 480 of the Code 
nor he sent the complaint to Magistrate, therefore, the impugned order on 
this score is nullity in the eyes of law. 
7. 
The contention of learned Prosecutors that in petty offences no appeal 
lies as per mandate of section 413 of the Code is also repelled because when

an offender is punished under section 180 PPC pursuant to section 480 of 
the Code then appeal against such order is provided under section 486 of 
the Code; therefore, this appeal is competent against the impugned order 
passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge. 
8. 
Attending to all the above circumstances, the appeal is allowed and 
the impugned conviction and sentence is set-aside.
