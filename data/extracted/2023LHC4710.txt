Through the instant Criminal Revision filed under Sections 
435 and 439 Cr.P.C., the petitioner has challenged the legality and 
validity of the order dated 12.08.2023 passed by the learned Judge, 
Anti-Terrorism Court-III, Lahore, whereby the request of the 
investigating officer for grant of 20-days physical remand of 
respondent No.1-Ali Akbar was turned down and he was sent to 
judicial lockup for 14-days. Hence, the instant petition.

Heard. Record perused.

Shafaqat Ali lodged a written complaint. The First Information 
Report was registered at Factory Area Police Station on 25.07.2023 
under the Sections 302/109/324/440/148/149 of the P.P.C. and 7 
ATA against respondent Ali Akbar and others. After that, the 
investigation of the case was taken up by the police. During the 
investigation, the Investigating Officer arrested respondent Ali 
Akbar on 29.07.2023. On 30.01.2023, respondent Ali Akbar was 
produced before the learned Area Magistrate for interim remand for 
one day. On 31.07.2023, the Investigating Officer produced 
respondent Ali Akbar before the learned Judge, ATC No. III, Lahore, 
and in response to the written request to hand over the accused for 12 
days for police remand for investigation, the Judge, ATC No. III, 
Lahore granted 12 days of physical remand of the accused to the 
investigating officer. After the expiry of the physical remand period, 
respondent Ali Akbar was produced before the court. The 
investigating officer sought the physical remand of respondent Ali 
Akbar for a confrontation meeting of respondent Ali Akbar with the 

Crl. Revision No. 56169 of 2023 
2
accused persons, whose names were disclosed by him, for 20 days. 
The learned Duty Administrative Judge, ATCs, Lahore, refused to 
hand over the accused to the investigating officer for further 
investigation vide impugned order dated 12.08.2023. The learned 
APG submitted that according to Section 21-E of the Anti-Terrorism 
Act, 1997, the learned trial court is bound to grant a minimum 
remand for 15 days when the investigating officer has credible 
information and reasonable suspicion on the file against the accused 
and prayed for setting aside the impugned order dated 12.08.2023. 
The contents of the FIR reveal that respondent Ali Akbar is named in 
the FIR with the allegation of abetment\facilitator of the incident. 
During the first physical remand of respondent Ali Akbar, the 
number plates of the vehicle used in the occurrence and three mobile 
phones were recovered. In the application for physical remand, the 
investigating officer had prayed for a physical remand of 20 days of 
the accused for a confrontation meeting with the accused persons and 
the arrest of the co-accused. It is an established Principle of Law that 
remand is not to be granted mechanically at the request of the police; 
instead, the Magistrate is expected to perform its duty after judicious 
application of mind. Sub-section (1) of Section 21-E of the Anti-
Terrorism Act, 1997 says that when a person is detained for 
investigation, the investigating officer, within 24 hours of the arrest 
of the accused, shall produce him before the court and may apply for 
physical remand of the accused which shall not be less than the 
maximum period of 15 days and not more than 30 days at one time. 
Sub-section (1) of Section 21-E of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, 
reads as under: 
 
“21E. Remand:- (1) Where a person is detained for 
investigation, the Investigating Officer, within 
twenty-four hours of the arrest, excluding the time 
necessary for the journey from the place of arrest 
to the Court, shall produce the accused before the 
Court, and may apply for remand of the accused to 
police 
custody, 
2[or 
custody 
of 
any 
other 
investigating agency joined in the investigation] for 

Crl. Revision No. 56169 of 2023 
3
which the maximum period allowed may be not less 
than 1[fifteen days and not more] than thirty days 
at one time:  
Provided that, where an accused cannot within 
twenty-four hours be produced before the Court, a 
temporary order for police custody 1[or custody of 
any other investigating agency joined in the 
investigation] not exceeding twenty-four hours may 
be obtained from the nearest Magistrate for the 
purpose of producing the accused before the Court 
within that period.” 
 
The mandate of Sub-section (1) of Section 21-E of the Anti-
Terrorism Act, 1997 is that when it is not possible to complete the 
investigation within 24 hours, then it is the duty of the Police to 
produce the accused before the court. Police cannot detain any 
person in their custody beyond that period. Therefore, Sub-Section 
(1) pre-supposes that the police should have custody of an accused 
about a specific accusation for which cognizance has been taken and 
the matter is under investigation. Sub-Section (1) says that if the 
accused is produced before the court, then the court can give a 
remand to the police for investigation not less than 15 days and not 
more than 30 days. But the proviso of Sub-section (2) of Section 21-
E of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 does not authorize the police to 
ask for police custody for a further period after the expiry of the first 
physical remand for not less than 15 days and more than 30 days. 
Instead, it gives discretion to the court if further evidence may be 
available and no bodily harm has been or will be caused to the 
accused; the court can authorize the detention of the accused person 
in custody of police for a period to the court's satisfaction. Sub-
section (2) of Section 21-E of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, reads as 
under: 
 
“(2) No expansion of the time of the remand of the 
accused in police custody 1[or custody of any other 
investigating agency joined in the investigation] 
shall be allowed unless it can be shown by the 
investigating officer to the satisfaction of the Court 
that further evidence may be available and the 
Court is satisfied that no bodily harm has been or 

Crl. Revision No. 56169 of 2023

will be caused to the accused: Provided that the 
total period of such remand shall not exceed 
1[ninety] days.” 
 
The whole purpose is that the accused should not be detained for 
more than 24 hours, and subject to the expiry of the first police 
remand, it can be extended up to 90 as the case may be. Therefore, 
the reading of sub-Section 2 with the proviso of Section 21-E of the 
Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, clearly transpires that the incumbent 
should be, in fact, under the detention of police for investigation for 
the period to the court's satisfaction. It is relevant to mention here 
that if one case is registered against the accused in which, during the 
investigation, it is found that he has committed more than one 
offense, then it will be treated as one investigation. For each offense, 
a separate police remand cannot be granted.  If that is permitted, then 
the police can go on adding some crime or the other of a severe 
nature at various stages and seek further detention in police custody 
repeatedly. This would defeat the very object underlying Sub-
Section 2 of Section 21-E of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997.  
4. 
We do not find any legal infirmity or illegality in the 
impugned order dated 12.08.2023 passed by the learned Duty 
Administrative Judge, ATCs, Lahore. The petitioner has no case to 
invoke the revisional jurisdiction of this Court. The petition having 
no merits is dismissed in limine.
