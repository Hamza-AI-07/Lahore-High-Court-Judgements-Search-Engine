……………………………………………………. 
MUHAMMAD AMJAD RAFIQ, J:- Sixteen nominated 
accused persons were summoned to face trial before the learned 
Additional Sessions Judge, Khanpur, in a private complaint arising out 
of FIR No.310 dated 14.07.2015, registered under Sections 302, 324, 
148, 149, 337F(iii), and 337-L(2) of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 
(“PPC") at Police Station Saddar Khanpur, District Rahim Yar Khan. 
Out of the said accused persons, accused Ashraf Mughal was acquitted 
on the basis of a compromise with injured PW Dildar Ahmad, through 
an application filed under Section 345(2) of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure, 1898 (“Cr.P.C.”). 
Vide judgment dated 11.05.2019, accused persons Rao Zulfiqar, 
Rafique, Shan, Bilal, Kaloo, Sadiq, Abid, Maqsood Mai, Meeman Mai, 
and Abdul Mannan were also acquitted by extending them the benefit 
of doubt.  
Accused/appellant Abdul Rasheed was convicted under Section 
302(b) PPC and sentenced to imprisonment for life as Ta’zir. He was 
further directed to pay Rs.200,000/- as compensation to the legal heirs 

 
Crl. Appeal No.332 of 2019

of deceased Munir Ahmad under Section 544A Cr.P.C., and in default 
to further undergo six months’ simple imprisonment. 
Accused/appellants Shabbir, Ramzan, Rashid and Khuda Bakhsh 
were convicted under Section 337-A(i) PPC and sentenced to pay 
Daman of Rs.10,000/-, to respective injured persons. However, in the 
impugned judgment, there is no reference to the benefit of Section 
382B Cr.P.C. 
It is further noted that on the day of pronouncement of the 
judgment, the accused/appellants Shabbir, Ramzan, Rashid, and Khuda 
Bakhsh expressed their willingness to pay the respective Daman 
amounts, which were accordingly paid. 
2.  
As per the contents of the FIR lodged by Muhammad Abbas 
(PW-1) on 14.07.2015 at about 07:15 p.m., the incident occurred when 
he was watering the cabbage crop owned by him. In the meanwhile, 
accused Rao Zulfiqar (armed with a pistol), Abdul Rasheed (armed 
with a repeater), Ashraf Mughal, Shabbir, Rafiq, Ramzan, Manan, 
Shan, Kaloo, Sadiq, Maqsood Mai, Haleema Mai, Abid Hussain, 
Arshad (Rashid) along with three unknown persons (armed with clubs) 
and Khuda Bakhsh (armed with a hatchet) arrived at the place of 
occurrence. 
  
Accused Rao Zulfiqar raised a lalkara that the complainant 
would be taught a lesson for pursuing the case. Immediately thereafter, 
accused Abdul Rasheed fired a shot with his repeater, hitting Munir 
Ahmad on the chest. Accused Rao Zulfiqar fired from his pistol, hitting 
Ayyaz Ahmad on the left shoulder. Ashraf Mughal struck a club blow 
on the head of Dildar Ahmad, while Ramzan delivered another club 
blow to the back of Dildar’s head. Arshad (Rashid) struck a club blow 
on the left side of the head of Muhammad Abbas/complainant, and 
Khuda Bakhsh hit him with the hind side of a hatchet on the right side 
of his forehead. Shabbir struck a club blow on Ayyaz Ahmad, hitting 
the middle of his head. The remaining accused Rafiq, Manan, Shan, 

 
Crl. Appeal No.332 of 2019

Abid, Kaloo, Bilal, and three unknown persons also assaulted the 
complainant party with clubs, while Mst. Maqsood Mai and Haleema 
Mai tortured them with fists and punches. 
  
The motive behind the occurrence, as alleged in the FIR, was a 
dispute over land. 
3. 
After registration of FIR the investigation commenced, however, 
feeling dissatisfied with the investigation, the complainant filed the 
private complaint, wherein, the prosecution story remained almost the 
same. On receipt of complaint and recording of cursory statements the 
complainant and witnesses, sixteen accused persons were summoned 
who joined the trial process. The accused were formally charge-sheeted 
for the offences alleged against them. Upon framing of the charge, 
accused denied the allegations, pleaded their innocence, and opted to 
face trial. In support of case, the prosecution produced its evidence, on 
close whereof the accused were examined under Section 342 Cr.P.C., 
wherein accused/appellants neither opted to record their statements 
under section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor to produce any defence evidence, 
except accused/appellant Abdul Rasheed who produced documents as 
Ex.DA to Ex.DS and the trial proceeded to its conclusion resulting in 
the conviction and sentence of the accused/appellants as previously 
detailed. 
4. 
Heard. Record perused. 
5.  
At the very inception, learned Assistant District Public 
Prosecutor for the State raised an objection, contending that the 
accused/appellants Shabbir, Ramzan, Rashid, and Khuda Bakhsh are 
not entitled to file an appeal against their conviction and sentence 
because by accepting the impugned judgment, they have deposited the 
respective amounts of Daman, which amounts to satisfaction of their 
sentence. It was therefore argued that once a party acquiesces its 
conviction and fulfills the corresponding sentential requirement, the 
right to challenge the same through appeal stands forfeited.  

 
Crl. Appeal No.332 of 2019  
 
4 
 
 
  
However, the contention raised by the learned Assistant District 
Public Prosecutor cannot be accepted in the light of clear legal position 
embodied in Section 415A of Cr.P.C., which specifically provides a 
special right of appeal in certain cases. For convenience, the said 
section is reproduced below: 
415A. Special right of appeal in certain 
cases. Notwithstanding anything contained in 
this Chapter, when more persons than one are 
convicted in one trial, and an appealable 
judgment or order has been passed in respect 
of any such person, all or any of the persons 
convicted at such trial shall have a right of 
appeal.  
  
A plain reading of the above provision makes it evident that 
when several persons are convicted in a single trial and an appealable 
judgment has been passed in respect of any of them, all or any of the 
co-convicts are equally entitled to prefer an appeal. Therefore, even 
though the said accused/appellants have deposited the amount of 
Daman in compliance with the impugned judgment, such compliance 
cannot be construed as a waiver or satisfaction of their conviction so as 
to extinguish their statutory right of appeal. Their right to challenge the 
conviction and sentence stands preserved under the clear mandate of 
Section 415A Cr.P.C. 
6.  
Coming back to case in hand, the contents of the FIR were duly 
corroborated by Muhammad Abbas (PW-1), the complainant, who 
appeared before the Court and, with unwavering certainty, reaffirmed 
the nomination of the accused/appellants, attributing to each of them 
the specific roles described in the FIR. His testimony found further 
support in the statements of Dildar Ahmad (injured/PW-2), Ayyaz 
Ahmad (injured/PW-3), and Rais Mushtaq Ahmad (eye-witness/PW-4), 
all of whom fully endorsed the prosecution’s version in every material 
particular. These witnesses were subjected to extensive cross-
examination by the defence; however, no material contradiction or 
inconsistency could be elicited to cast doubt on their credibility or 

 
Crl. Appeal No.332 of 2019  
 
5 
 
 
weaken the prosecution’s case. Their testimonies remained consistent, 
coherent, and mutually corroborative throughout. 
7.  
Apart from the ocular account furnished by the prosecution 
witnesses, the record clearly establishes that the occurrence took place 
on 14.07.2015 at about 07:15 p.m. on the agricultural land of 
Muhammad Abbas (PW-1), the complainant. The matter was reported 
to the police without delay at 08:45 p.m., resulting in the prompt 
registration of the FIR. This immediacy in reporting lends strong 
assurance to the authenticity of the occurrence, indicating that it was 
neither obscure nor unobserved. Rather, it compellingly suggests the 
presence of witnesses at the place of occurrence. The credibility of their 
presence is further reinforced by the location of the incident, being the 
complainant’s own land, as per FIR. Hence, the presence of the 
witnesses, as well as that of the deceased, at the relevant time and place 
appears entirely natural and credible. 
8.  
Significantly, the defence has not seriously disputed either the 
venue of occurrence or the presence of these witnesses, thereby lending 
further support to the prosecution’s version. The prompt lodging of the 
FIR constitutes a strong corroborative circumstance in favour of the 
prosecution, wherein the complainant not only named the accused with 
clarity but also specified the roles attributed to each, including the 
nature and location of the injuries inflicted. Such promptitude, coupled 
with the detailed narration of facts, denotes a spontaneous and 
unembellished account of the incident, leaving little room for 
afterthought, fabrication, or collusion. 
9.  
In legal phraseology, this degree of immediacy is a recognized 
symbol of truthfulness, particularly when the complainant himself 
sustained injuries yet managed to present a coherent and consistent 
version of events. The absence of any material delay or ambiguity 
further diminishes the possibility of deliberation or manipulation, 

 
Crl. Appeal No.332 of 2019  
 
6 
 
 
thereby imparting substantial weight to the prosecution’s case at its 
very inception. 
10. 
Prosecution’s version of FIR finds substantial corroboration from 
the medical evidence adduced through Dr. Arslan Shahid (PW-10), 
who testified that the dead body was received at the mortuary at 08:00 
p.m., and the post-mortem examination was conducted at 11:45 p.m., 
within approximately four hours and thirty minutes of the occurrence. 
Furthermore, the complainant and the two injured persons were 
medically examined by Dr. Noshab Ahmad (PW-9) within about forty 
minutes of the occurrence. This remarkable promptness is not merely 
based on oral assertions but is duly supported by documentary 
evidence, including the post-mortem report of Munir Ahmad and the 
medicolegal certificates of the complainant Muhammad Abbas and the 
injured witnesses, Dildar Ahmad and Ayyaz Ahmad. The timings 
recorded in these documents precisely correspond with the testimony of 
the medical officers, thereby lending strong corroborative value to the 
prosecution’s case. 
11.  
Though the learned counsel(s) for the accused/appellants contend 
that, according to the medical officer, the trajectory of the bullet was 
superior to inferior, which allegedly contradicts the prosecution version 
wherein the witnesses claimed that a straight fire was made. While 
attending to this contention, I went into recitation of deposition of the 
doctor on this aspect. As per his opinion, the bullet entered the body by 
fracturing the 4th and 5th ribs and became lodged between the 5th and 
6th ribs; hence, no exit wound was observed, and the cartridge shell 
was recovered from within the chest cavity. The striking of the bullet 
against the ribs naturally produced a ricochet effect. Therefore, the 
medical findings do not necessarily negate the prosecution version; 
rather, they are consistent with a shot which though entered straight 
into the body but by ricochet effect struck inferior to it. Consequently, 
the defence cannot take any advantage of this contention. 

 
Crl. Appeal No.332 of 2019

12.  
The identification of the accused/appellants is also beyond any 
doubt in the present case. The occurrence took place on the agricultural 
land of the complainant at about 07:15 p.m. on 14.07.2015. 
Considering that the month of July offers sufficient daylight at that 
hour, the occurrence can rightly be termed a daylight occurrence, 
leaving little possibility of error in identification. Furthermore, since 
there existed a land dispute between the parties, the accused were 
already well known to the complainant and the witnesses, making any 
likelihood of misidentification highly improbable. 
13.  
In addition, the medical evidence further corroborates the 
presence of the accused at the place of occurrence. Accused Abdul 
Mannan and Malik Kaloo were medically examined by Dr. Arslan 
Shahid (PW-10), while accused Mst. Maqsood Mai and Mst. Meeman 
Mai were examined by Dr. Namra Khan (PW-18). These medical 
examinations substantiate the commission of the offence and confirm 
the presence of the accused persons at the place of occurrence. Hence, 
there remains no room for any suggestion of mistaken identity or denial 
of the occurrence at the stated venue. 
14.  
With regard to recovery, the record reflects that CW-2 
Muhammad Rasheed, SI/I.O., collected the empties of cartridges from 
the spot on 14.07.2015. The accused/appellant Abdul Rasheed was 
subsequently arrested on 09.11.2015, whereas the spent shells had 
already been forwarded to the PFSA on 19.08.2015, well before his 
arrest. The recovery of the repeater gun from the accused/appellant was 
effected on 18.11.2015, and the said weapon was sent to the PFSA on 
22.12.2015. The PFSA report was received as positive in this regard 
which provides a corroboration to ocular account.  
15.  
The motive in this case is not in dispute. Both the parties agree 
that there was a dispute over the ownership of the land, although they 
maintain different stances regarding ownership and possession of land. 
In this view of the matter, since either way aggression between the 

 
Crl. Appeal No.332 of 2019  
 
8 
 
 
parties has not been seriously doubted, therefore, in this case, motive 
can validly be termed to have acted as a double-edged weapon. 
16.  
Only a single fire shot was attributed to the accused/appellant 
Abdul Rasheed, and the motive was not solely ascribed to him. 
Therefore, the learned trial Court considered these factors as mitigating 
circumstances and awarded the alternate sentence of imprisonment for 
life. Though certain recoveries were shown to have been effected from 
the accused/appellants Shabbir, Ramzan, Rashid, and Khuda Bakhsh 
but such recoveries were of no material consequence. The learned trial 
Court imposed only Daman upon them, rightly holding that they did 
not qualify as hardened or desperate offenders within the contemplation 
of Section 337(N), PPC. This finding of the learned trial Court is well-
reasoned and calls for no interference. 
17.  
For what has been discussed above, I am of the firm view that 
here in this case the prosecution remained fully successful in 
establishing the guilt of the accused/appellants, namely, Abdul 
Rasheed, Shabbir, Ramzan, Rashid and Khuda Bakhsh beyond 
reasonable doubt. The findings and conclusions of the learned trial 
Court viz. conviction and sentence of the accused/appellants have been 
found perfect being result of correct and proper appraisal of evidence 
on record. Consequently, while relying upon cases reported as “MUNIR 
AHMAD Versus The STATE and others” (2025 SCMR 1123), “ALTAF 
HUSSAIN Versus The STATE” (2025 SCMR 1427), “MUHAMMAD 
IJAZ alias Jajj Versus The STATE” (2025 SCMR 1591), “GHULAM 
RASOOL Versus The STATE” (2025 SCMR 74), “ALTAF HUSSAIN 
Versus THE STATE” (2010 SCMR 1020), “MUHAMMAD KHAN 
alias MITHU Versus The STATE and others” (PLD 2025 Supreme 
Court 425) & “MUHAMMAD MISKEEN Versus The STATE” (2025 
SCMR 1512), the titled criminal appeal fail and is dismissed. 
Consequently, their conviction and sentences are upheld and 
maintained. Benefit of section 382B Cr.P.C. is extended in favour of 
Abdul Rasheed accused/appellant. The accused/appellant Abdul 
Rasheed is on bail through suspension of sentence vide order dated

09.11.2021 passed in Crl. Misc. No.2005-M of 2021, therefore, he be 
sent to concerned jail for serving out of his remaining sentence. The 
record of the learned trial court be sent back immediately and the case 
property, if any, shall be dealt with as directed by the learned trial 
Court.
