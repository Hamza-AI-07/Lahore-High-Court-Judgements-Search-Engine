Petitioners By: 
Syed Muhammad Shah, Advocate

Mr. Jahanzeb Inam, Additional Advocate General 
 
ABID HUSSAIN CHATTHA, J: This constitutional Petition is directed 
against the impugned Order and Judgment dated 13.09.2023 and 31.10.2023 
passed by Judge Family Court / Executing Court and Additional District 
Judge, Faisalabad, respectively. 
2. 
 
Brief facts of the case are that the Petitioners instituted a suit for 
recovery of maintenance allowance and dowry articles against Respondent 
No. 3 (the “Respondent”) which was partially decreed by the Family Court 
vide Judgment and Decree dated 03.09.2018. The Petitioners and the 
Respondent preferred cross appeals against the said Judgment and Decree. 
The Appellate Court dismissed appeal of the Respondent while appeal of the 
Petitioners was partially allowed vide consolidated Judgment and Decree 
dated 18.03.2019, thereby, ordering modification in the Decree of the 
Family Court. Both the parties filed separate W. P. Nos. 22863 and 23430 of 
2019 before this Court which were partially allowed and the Judgment and 
Decree stood further modified. Statedly, the matter has attained finality up to 
the level of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.

3. 
 
During execution proceedings, the Respondent filed an 
Objection Petition before the Executing Court seeking calculation of paid 
amount of maintenance allowance with reference to 10% annual increase 
awarded to the minors in the final Decree under execution by alleging that 
the Petitioners are calculating the annual increase on compound basis which 
is unlawful since there is no such stipulation in the Decree or the law. It was 
maintained that maintenance allowance once decreed by the Court remains 
constant and static which merely increases by 10% each year in terms of 
Section 17-A(3) of the Family Courts Act, 1964 (the “Act”). Reliance was 
placed on cases titled, “Mir Muhammad Khan and 2 others v. Haider and 
others” (PLD 2020 Supreme Court 233); “Muhammad Anwar v. Bashir 
Ahmad and another” (2014 CLC 1819); and “Kashif Mahmood v. 
Additional District Judge and others” (2022 MLD 1762). The said 
application was resisted by the Petitioners on the ground that maintenance 
allowance fixed by Court is enhanced by 10% after first year and increase 
thereupon in the second year is applicable on the cumulative amount of 
preceding year, as such, 10% annual enhancement is leviable on compound 
basis as contemplated by Section 17-A(3) of the Act. The Courts below by 
relying upon the case of Kashif Mahmood (supra) opined that rate of annual 
increment in each year is to be calculated on base value of the maintenance 
allowance fixed by the Court and not on the enhanced maintenance amount 
of previous year arrived at by adding annual increment. Hence, this Petition. 
4. 
 
During proceedings of this case, it transpired that two separate 
single Benches of this Court in cases titled, “Mian Muhammad Latif v. 
Additional District Judge, etc.” (W. P. No. 77557 / 2022) decided on 
07.12.2022; and “Sohaib Umar Ilyas v. Judge Family Court, etc.” (W. P. 
No. 15888 / 2021) decided on 02.02.2023 expressed the view that annual 
increase in maintenance allowance is required to be calculated on compound 
basis in terms of Section 17-A(3) of the Act in contrast to the view taken by 
another learned Single Bench of this Court in the case of Kashif Mahmood 
(supra). Accordingly, constitution of a larger Bench was recommended vide 
order dated 30.04.2024, whereafter, the matter was referred to this Bench. 
Notice was issued on 16.05.2024 to the Attorney General of Pakistan and 

3 
 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 7340 / 2024 
 
 
Advocate General of Punjab under Order XXVII-A of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908 (the “CPC”) seeking assistance to determine the following 
question:- 
Whether the statutory annual increase of 10% in maintenance 
allowance ordained in Section 17-A(3) of the Act will apply on 
compoundable or non-compoundable basis? 
5. 
 
Learned counsel for the Petitioners and learned Federal Law 
Officer favored compound calculation of annual increase on the decreed 
amount of maintenance. It was submitted that Section 17-A of the Act is 
required to be interpreted in the context of overall scheme of law enshrined 
in the Act which is not only beneficial in nature but also emphasizes the 
importance of maintenance allowance as the only source of subsistence of 
women and children. The provision caters for changed circumstances in 
terms of their needs and protects them against inflation and price hike. The 
mandatory annual increase of 10% is applicable at a minimum to all 
maintenance decrees although the Court is vested with discretion to 
prescribe a higher rate. There is no specific stipulation therein regarding 
calculation of annual enhancement on base or aggregate value of 
maintenance. However, the intent and import of the said provision is that 
annual increase of each year is required to be imposed on the cumulative or 
aggregate amount of maintenance allowance of the previous year. This is an 
obvious conclusion since the Act, in general, and Section 17-A(3) thereof, in 
particular, is a beneficial legislation aimed to hedge inflation and devaluation 
of currency. Women and children are oppressed class who are entitled to 
beneficial interpretation of law which is the intent of legislature in line with 
the directive Principles of Policy enunciated under Articles 34, 35 and 37 of 
the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the 
“Constitution”) as emphasized by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in case 
titled, “Saif-ur-Rehman v. Additional District Judge, Toba Tek Singh and 2 
others” (2018 SCMR 1885). 
6. 
 
Learned counsels further submitted that annual rent increments 
under the Punjab Rented Premises Act, 2009 (the “Rent Act”) as a widely 
accepted general practice are calculated on compound basis reflecting real 
value of money and property appreciation. The Courts in foreign 

4 
 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 7340 / 2024 
 
 
jurisdictions employ compound or index-linked payments in long-term 
financial obligations, such as maintenance, to ensure fairness and alignment 
with inflation. In case titled, “Sempra Metals Limited (formerly 
Metallgesellschaft Limited v. Her Majesty‟s Commissioners of Inland 
Revenue and another”, (2007 UKHL 34), the House of Lords ruled in favor 
of compound interest on the ground that it accurately reflects the true value 
of money over time. In contrast, it was noted that flat interest rates fail to 
account for real time inflation and time value of money. Although a 
custodial parent can institute a subsequent suit or approach the Executing 
Court by filing an application for enhancement in maintenance allowance in 
changed circumstances yet the purpose of introducing Section 17-A(3) of the 
Act is to protect the decree holder against annual real-time inflation, thus 
reducing the occasions to frequently resort to Court seeking enhancement in 
maintenance on the ground of increase in inflation and growing needs of 
minors. Therefore, by implementing automatic compound increases, the 
Court can streamline adjustments in maintenance in a manner that reduces 
the need for frequent litigation. This will save costs, time, resources and 
emotional stress for decree holders. Such an interpretation would bring 
certainty in fixation of maintenance allowance and would lead to financial 
stability for the decree holders to meet their evolving needs. Therefore, the 
ambiguity in Section 17-A(3) of the Act regarding flat versus compound 
annual increase should be resolved in favor of compound calculations which 
is a more equitable and efficient approach of adjusting maintenance over 
time against inflationary trends and growing needs. 
7. 
 
Learned Counsel for the Respondent and Provincial Law 
Officer advanced arguments in support of annual increase in maintenance on 
non-compoundable or linear basis. It was stated that the Decree under 
execution was passed under Section 17-A(2) of the Act which provides for 
10% annual increase and like all family decrees, is required to be executed 
under Section 13 thereof. Hence, Section 17-A(3) of the Act is not attracted 
as the Decree was passed under Section 17-A(2) of the Act. The former 
comes into play only when the Family Court fails to prescribe annual 
increase. Without prejudice to the above, the intention of legislature to 

5 
 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 7340 / 2024 
 
 
induct Section 17-A(3) in the Act is express and clear that if the Family 
Court does not prescribe the annual increment, the „maintenance fixed by the 
Court‟ would automatically increase by 10% each year, thus providing for 
in-built hedging against inflation. The Family Court is empowered to 
determine the quantum of maintenance allowance which remains fixed till 
legal entitlement and the said amount annually increases by 10% thereon, 
thereby, adequately providing for statutory cushion against price hike and 
inflation. In case, the intention of legislature was to provide for compound 
annal increase, it could have been expressly specified therein.  As such, the 
conspicuous and conscious omission cannot be substituted by the Court. 
Islamic jurisprudence derived from the Holy Quran as well as case law on 
the subject emphasize the importance to strike a balance between the 
responsibility to pay maintenance to wife and children on the one hand and 
the financial capacity to pay the same on the other hand. Therefore, the 
provision of Section 17-A(3) of the Act must be interpreted in a manner to 
maintain a balance and proportionality between competing rights. Hence, the 
levy of 10% annual increase on compound amount would lead to injustice.   
8.  
 
It was further contended that the Rent Act does not provide for 
automatic 10% compound increase, rather, it is always with the mutual 
consent of landlord and tenant based on lease agreement. Hence, annual 
increase in rent does not take effect by operation of any law in contrast to 
Section 17-A(3) of the Act. As such, the former cannot be equated with the 
latter. Moreover, the comparative example is misconceived inasmuch as the 
landlord offers the demised premises against a definite rent which is fixed 
with the mutual consent of landlord and tenant but in contrast, payment of 
maintenance allowance is a personal right rooted in love and affection of a 
person towards his wife and children. Hence, the concept of increase in rent 
on compound basis cannot be employed in interpretation of Section 17-A(3) 
of the Act. Therefore, the moot point under consideration has been rightly 
determined in the case of Kashif Mahmood (supra) particularly, when in the 
cases of Mian Muhammad Latif and Sohaib Umar Ilyas (supra), no 
definitive finding on the question of law was rendered. This is particularly so 
when in cases titled, “Muhammad Iqbal v. Mst. Nasreen Akhtar” (2012 

6 
 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 7340 / 2024 
 
 
CLC 1407); and “Muhammad Akram v. Additional District Judge and 
others” (PLD 2008 Lahore 560), the Court opined that the principle of res 
judicata embodied in the CPC is not a bar to institute a fresh suit for 
enhancement in maintenance allowance due to changed circumstances. 
Therefore, if the 10% automatic increase on non-compound basis as per 
Section 17-A(3) of the Act is found inadequate in any particular case, the 
option to institute a fresh suit for enhancement in maintenance allowance 
can be exercised. Hence, the 10% increase in maintenance on compound 
basis would be highly unjustified as the same is not the intent and import of 
Section 17-A(3) of the Act. 
9. 
 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
10. 
 
The relevant part of modified final Decree qua maintenance 
amount subject of Objection Petition with respect to calculation of annual 
increase of 10% reads as under: 
“The plaintiffs No. 2 & 3 being minor children of the defendant 
are held entitled to recover maintenance allowance from the 
defendant @ Rs. 150,000/- each per month from the date of 
institution of suit till their legal entitlement with 10% annual 
increment.” 
11. 
 
The Decree thus contemplates payment of maintenance at the 
rate of Rs. 150,000/- for each minor from the date of institution of suit i.e. 
29.03.2014 with 10% annual increase. It did not specify if the annual 
increase shall take effect on compound or non-compound basis, thus 
triggering the moot question framed for determination. As the pro and 
contra arguments revolve around interpretation of Sections 13 and 17-A of 
the Act, therefore, it would be advantageous to reproduce the same as under:  
“13. Enforcement of decrees.– (1) The Family Court shall pass 
a decree in such form and in such manner as may be prescribed, 
and shall enter its particulars in the prescribed register. 
(2) 
If any money is paid or any property is delivered in the 
presence of the Family Court, in satisfaction of the decree, it shall 
enter the fact of payment or the delivery of property, as the case may 
be, in the aforesaid register. 
(3) 
Where a decree relates to the payment of money and 
the decretal amount is not paid within time specified by the 
Court not exceeding thirty days, the same shall, if the Court so 

7 
 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 7340 / 2024 
 
 
directs be recovered as arrears of land revenue, and on recovery 
shall be paid to the decree-holder. 
(4) 
The decree shall be executed by the Court, passing it or by 
such other Civil Court as the District Judge may, by special or 
general order, direct. 
(5) 
A Family Court may, if it so deems fit, direct that any money 
to be paid under a decree passed by it be paid in such installments 
as it deems fit. 
 
17A. Suit for maintenance.– (1) In a suit for maintenance, the 
Family Court shall, on the date of the first appearance of the 
defendant, fix interim monthly maintenance for wife or a child and 
if the defendant fails to pay the maintenance by fourteen day of 
each month, the defence of the defendant shall stand struck off 
and the Family Court shall decree the suit for maintenance on the 
basis of averments in the plaint and other supporting documents 
on record of the case. 
(2)   In a decree for maintenance, the Family Court may: 
(a) 
fix an amount of maintenance higher than the 
amount prayed for in the plaint due to afflux of time 
or any other relevant circumstances; and 
(b) 
prescribe the annual increase in the maintenance. 
(3)   If the Family Court does not prescribe the annual increase 
in the maintenance, the maintenance fixed by the Court shall 
automatically stand increased at the rate of ten percent each year. 
(4) 
For purposes of fixing the maintenance, the Family Court 
may summon the relevant documentary evidence from any 
organization, body or authority to determine the estate and 
resources of the defendant.” 
 
12. 
 
Section 12(2) of the Act empowers the Family Court to 
pronounce its judgment and pass the decree after conclusion of trial. Section 
13 of the Act is another general provision of law which relates to the 
enforcement of all decrees passed under the Act. It obligates the Family 
Court to pass a decree in the prescribed form and manner. It also mandates 
to record and maintain necessary particulars qua payments and delivery of 
property. This is imperative since family decrees by their very nature 
involve payment of money on monthly basis and receipt of multiple dowry 
articles. Further provisions are made in the Family Courts Rules, 1965 
including prescribing of uniform Forms for recording of decrees and 
maintaining of the Register of Receipts and Disbursements. Section 13 of 
the Act also empowers the Executing Court to direct recovery of unpaid 
amounts as arrears of land revenue including the power to effect recovery of 
money in installments to ensure execution of decrees.  

8 
 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 7340 / 2024 
 
 
13. 
 
In contrast, Section 17-A of the Act is a specific provision 
dealing with suit for maintenance as a special category of family claims. 
Section 17-A of the Act in its present form was introduced in the Act 
through the Punjab Family Courts (Amendment) Act, 2015 (XI of 2015) dated 
18.03.2015. It places maintenance of wife and children at a higher pedestal 
than other family claims because maintenance allowance serves as a means 
of subsistence and survival for them, intrinsically connected to their right to 
life guaranteed under Articles 4 and 9 of the Constitution. Section 17-A(1) 
provides for fixation of monthly interim maintenance allowance for wife or a 
child on the date of the first appearance of the defendant and failure of the 
defendant to pay the same by fourteenth day of each month entails penal 
consequences in terms of striking off his defence, thereby, paving the way for 
passing of decree for maintenance on the basis of averments in the plaint and 
other supporting documents on record of the case. Section 17-A(2) of the Act 
postulates that in a decree of maintenance, the Family Court may fix an 
amount of maintenance higher than the amount prayed for in the plaint due 
to afflux of time or any other relevant circumstances and prescribe the 
annual increase in the maintenance. It is evident that necessary discretion has 
been vested in the Family Court to cater for the time consumed in decision of 
the suit for maintenance and address other relevant circumstances in order to 
ensure that an adequate quantum of maintenance is fixed. This provision also 
confers discretionary powers on the Family Court to prescribe an annual 
increase in maintenance to cater for future needs and requirements of plaintiffs 
as well as depreciation in the value of currency in terms of inflation. No caveat 
is attached to the power of the Family Court to prescribe such annual increase 
in maintenance on compound or non-compound basis and the Family Court is 
free to pass a reasonable decree in this behalf depending on the facts and 
circumstances of the case.  
14. 
 
In the instant case, however, the Court did not specify if annul 
increase would apply on compoundable or non-compoundable basis. In such 
situations, the operation of Section 17-A(3) of the Act comes into play. This 
provision stresses the importance and requirement of prescribing an annual 
increase in the maintenance. The provision is couched in negative covenant and 
provides that if the Family Court does not prescribe annual increase in the 

9 
 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 7340 / 2024 
 
 
maintenance, the maintenance fixed by the Court shall automatically stand 
increased at the rate of 10% each year. At the same time, it prescribes a 
statutory threshold  or standard that was considered appropriate by the 
legislature in case, the Court does not specify the annual increase itself 
depending upon the facts and circumstances of a particular case. The Decree 
under execution as well as Section 17-A(3) of the Act does not specifically 
state if the annual increase would be realized on compoundable or non-
compoundable basis. Therefore, the argument that Section 17-A(3) of the Act 
has no relevance as Decree under execution was passed under Section 17-A(2) 
of the Act requiring execution under Section 13 thereof, is misconceived for the 
reason that a simple decree not providing for calculation of annual increase in 
maintenance on compoundable or non-compoundable basis requires 
interpretation of Section 17-A(3) of the Act which is vividly promulgated to 
supply omissions in the decrees for maintenance. This is particularly so when it 
is not the case of the Respondent that the Decree under execution required 
maintenance to be calculated on non-compound basis. Since the Decree in this 
respect is silent and Section 17-A(3) of the Act is ambiguous, therefore, 
interpretation of the latter is imperative to give effect to the Decree according 
to the mandate of Section 17-A(3) of the Act. Needless to reiterate that Section 
13 of the Act only deals with the enforcement of decrees and has no relevance 
qua determination of annual increase on decreed amount of maintenance.   
15. 
 
There is no cavil to the proposition that Islamic jurisprudence 
as interpreted by superior Courts unequivocally hold that maintenance is to 
be determined on equitable terms by balancing competing interests, as such, 
the financial status, income, resources and estate of a person liable to pay 
maintenance is required to be proportionally adjusted against the needs and 
requirements of wife and children while fixing the quantum of maintenance. 
Nevertheless, questions qua entitlement to maintenance as well as quantum 
of maintenance are settled on the basis of facts and evidence from case-to-
case basis and the same exercise was undertaken in the instant case. 
However, the grant of annual increase on the quantum of decreed 
maintenance and its calculation on compound or non-compound basis is 
altogether a different question. The rationale to provide annual increase in 
maintenance fixed by the Court is rooted in hedging inflation and providing 

10 
 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 7340 / 2024 
 
 
for anticipated future yet inevitable needs and requirements of wife and 
children. There is no doubt that quantum of maintenance once fixed after 
trial cannot remain stagnant. There may be a host of changed circumstances, 
such as, inflation, increased cost of existing needs or new requirements in 
wake of growing age when there is a need for revising the determined 
maintenance by the Court. It is in this context that the Courts in the cases of 
Muhammad Iqbal and Muhammad Akram (supra) held that the principle of 
res judicata in the CPC is not applicable to a subsequent suit for 
enhancement in maintenance based on changed circumstances since such 
circumstances provide a fresh cause of action. In fact, the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in case titled, “Lt. Col. Naseer Malik v. Additional District Judge, 
Lahore and others” (2016 SCMR 1821) went as far as to hold that an 
application under Section 151 of the CPC seeking enhancement in 
maintenance is maintainable in lieu of instituting a separate subsequent suit 
in the following words:-  
“6….Once a decree by the Family Court in a suit for maintenance is 
granted thereunder, if the granted rate for per month allowance is 
insufficient and inadequate, in that case, according to scheme of law, 
institution of fresh suit is not necessary rather the Family Court may 
entertain any such application and if necessary make alteration in the 
rate of maintenance allowance.”  
16. 
 
The right to institute a subsequent suit or filing of an 
application for enhancement in maintenance allowance, however, is always 
cumbersome entailing costs, resources and time, thus burdening the wife and 
children to frequently resort to Court. It is ostensibly clear that by 
introducing substituted Section 17-A in the Act, the legislature intended to 
stipulate a comprehensive arrangement with respect to maintenance, thus 
empowering the Court to fix interim monthly maintenance, pass a decree 
upon failure of the defendant to pay the same, fix maintenance higher than 
prayed amount due to afflux of time or upon consideration of relevant 
circumstances and prescribe annual increase. To top it all, Section 17-A(3) 
of the Act mandated automatic 10% annual enhancement by operation of 
law, if the Court failed to prescribe annual increase. This arrangement was 
put in place to reduce the occasions for wife and children to have frequent 
recourse to Court for enhancement in maintenance, thus accounting for 

11 
 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 7340 / 2024 
 
 
inflation, rising cost of living and evolving requirements of wife and 
children. 
17. 
 
The legislature while promulgating Section 17-A(3) of the Act 
did not specifically provide for compound or non-compound calculation of 
prescribed automatic annual increase. In financial transactions, both 
compound and non-compound standards are employed in our jurisprudence. 
Section 34(1) of the CPC confers discretionary powers upon the Court to 
grant costs subject to such conditions and limitations, as may be prescribed, 
and to the provisions of law for the time being in force. Section 34(3) of the 
CPC further ordains that the Court may give interest on costs at any rate not 
exceeding six per cent, per annum, and such interest shall be added to the 
costs and shall be recoverable as such.” The Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
case titled, “Najm Koreshi v. Chase Manhattan Bank Now Muslim 
Commercial Bank Limited, Lahore and others” (2015 SCMR 1461), while 
interpreting Section 34 of the CPC recognized the power of the Court to 
grant simple or compound interest and opined that interest pendente lite and 
further interest are both discretionary reliefs, therefore, unless expressly 
ordered in a decree, such interest accrues on principal amount adjudged and 
not on the aggregate of that amount with accumulated interest.  
18. 
 
In contrast, Section 28 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 
expressly provides for compound interest on adjudged compensation at the 
rate of eight percent from the date of possession of acquired property. 
Similarly, Section 5-A(1) of the Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Ordinance, 
1959 (since repealed) proclaimed that “the rent of a non-residential building 
shall stand automatically increased at the end of every three years of its 
tenancy by twenty-five percent of the rent already being paid by the tenant” 
thus, stipulating enhancement in rent on the immediately preceding or 
prevalent rent. However, Section 6(1)(c) of the Rent Act in vogue leaves the 
matters qua rate of rent, rate of enhancement due date and mode of payment 
of rent to the mutual consent of the landlord and the tenant to be determined 
through the tenancy agreement. Notwithstanding the same, practically and as 
a generally accepted trade practice, enhancement in rent is actualized on the 
last preceding rent and not on the original amount of rent fixed. It, therefore, 

12 
 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 7340 / 2024 
 
 
follows that both compound and non-compound calculations are part of our 
jurisprudence. At times, it is expressly provided by law or otherwise it is left 
at the discretion of the Court depending upon the facts and circumstances of 
the transaction. Therefore, the ambiguity in Section 17-A(3) of the Act can 
be best resolved by analyzing the scheme of law enshrined in the Act in the 
context of nature of maintenance claim based on the guiding principles of 
fairness, equity and justice. 
19. 
 
The Act has been promulgated for the establishment of Family 
Courts for expeditious settlement and disposal of disputes relating to 
marriage, family affairs and other matter connected therewith. In furtherance 
of the stated objective, a convenient and flexible procedure has been 
prescribed in the Act for time bound adjudication of a family suit. Strict 
rules of procedure are dispensed with as Section 17(1) of the Act postulates 
that save as otherwise expressly provided by or under the Act, the provisions 
of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 and the CPC, except Sections 10 and 
11 thereof, shall not apply to proceedings before any Family Court in respect 
of Part I of Schedule to the Act. The superior Courts in view of the intent, 
purpose and objective of the Act have consistently adopted a liberal and 
beneficial approach in interpretation of various provisions of the Act. In 
Saif-ur-Rehman case (supra), the Supreme Court of Pakistan while 
interpreting Section 14(2) of the Act underscored the need of purposive 
interpretation of the Act in the following words: 
“10. …….It is now settled law that a purposive rather than a 
literal approach to interpretation is to be adopted while 
interpreting Statutes. An interpretation which advances the 
purpose of the Act is to be preferred rather than an 
interpretation which defeats its objects. Reference, in this 
behalf, may be made to the judgments reported as Federation of 
Pakistan through Ministry of Finance and others v. M/s. Noori 
Trading Corporation (Private) Limited and 14 others (1992 
SCMR 710) and Hudabiya Engineering (Pvt.) Limited v. 
Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Interior, Government 
of Pakistan and 6 others (PLD 1998 Lahore 90). 
11. 
The second aspect of the Family Courts Act, 1964 and 
the Rules framed thereunder as amended from time to time 
would reveal its gender sensitivity. A glance at Section 3 of the 
Act of 1964 reveals that women Judges are specifically catered 

13 
 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 7340 / 2024 
 
 
for. The residence of the wife can be a determining factor for 
conferring territorial jurisdiction, in certain Suits as is evident 
from the provisions of Rule 6 of the West Pakistan Family 
Courts Rules, 1965. There can be no escape from the fact that 
the tone and tenor of the Family Courts Act, 1964 and the Rules 
framed thereunder are beneficial in nature. It is an equally 
settled law that beneficial provisions in a Statute must be 
interpreted liberally in a manner so that the benefit conferred is 
advanced rather than frustrated or subverted. Reference, in this 
behalf, may be made to the judgments of this Court reported as 
Lahore Development Authority through D.G., Lahore and 
another v. Abdul Shafique and others (PLD 2000 SC 207) and 
Pakistan Engineering Co. Limited, Lahore through Managing 
Director v. Fazal Beg and 2 others (1992 SCMR 2166).” 
20. 
 
The preamble of the Constitution highlights the importance of 
social justice and ordains that adequate provision shall be made to safeguard 
legitimate interests of depressed classes.  The right to life is protected under 
Articles 4 and 9 of the Constitution. The right of maintenance of wife and 
children is undoubtedly an inseparable part of right to life as they are 
dependent on maintenance for their very survival in terms of their basic 
needs and requirements with respect to food, clothing, shelter, schooling and 
healthcare. The right to receive maintenance is a legal right granted by law 
and enforceable through the Court. It is not merely a personal right based on 
love and affection of a person towards his wife and children. Maintenance 
must be received by those held entitled to receive the same with dignity in 
terms of Article 14 of the Constitution. Even the non-discrimination clause 
embodied in Article 25 of the Constitution proclaiming equal protection of 
law for all citizens, creates a conscious and conspicuous exception by 
proclaiming that the State is not prevented from making any special 
provision for the protection of women and children. The directive Principles 
of Policy contained in Articles 34, 35 and 37 of the Constitution particularly 
call upon the State to ensure full participation of women in all spheres of 
national life; protect marriage, the family, the mother and the child; promote 
special care, educational and economic interests of backward classes; and 
ensure inexpensive and expeditious justice.

Therefore, it is abundantly clear that Section 17-A(3) of the Act 
is a beneficial, remedial or curative provision which calls for liberal

interpretation. It is triggered when the Court omits to prescribe annual 
increase in maintenance or does not expressly specify if annual increase so 
prescribed will take effect on compound or non-compound basis while 
passing a decree under Section 17-A(2) read with Section 12(2) of the Act. 
If the legislature has not specifically provided for compound calculation in 
Section 17-A(3) of the Act, it is equally true that the legislature has also not 
provided otherwise. The expression „the maintenance fixed by the Court 
shall automatically stand increased at the rate of ten percent each year” 
ordinarily imply that quantum of maintenance fixed under a decree does not 
remain static or constant but is a variable figure which is meant to increase 
after each year. After increase of 10% at the end of first year, a new quantum 
of maintenance comes in field and the amount gets merged or amalgamated 
in the quantum of maintenance fixed by Court. The process is repeated after 
each year till the legal entitlement of wife or children under the decree. 
Therefore, annual increase of each year is required to be calculated on the 
merged amount of last preceding year for the reason that 10% increase is 
intrinsically linked with the principal amount and is an inseparable part of 
the decree. If the rent is traditionally increased with reference to the last 
prevailing rent, there is no reason why maintenance should not be increased 
based on the same principle. The compound calculation of maintenance not 
only caters for inflation and rising cost of living but also allows to account 
for growing needs and requirements of wife and children, thus, reducing the 
occasions to resort to Court seeking enhancement in maintenance allowance. 
Hence, it is concluded that when a decree of maintenance does not prescribe 
an annual increase or is silent qua calculation of prescribed annual 
enhancement on principal or aggregate amount of maintenance, Section 17-
A(3) of the Act will come into operation and the Executing Court shall 
calculate the due decreed amount on compound basis.

Before parting, we note that in the case of Kashif Mahmood 
(supra), it has been aptly held that Section 17-A(3) of the Act shall apply to 
all pending proceedings from the date of its promulgation and the finding 
contained therein to this extent is fully endorsed.

In view of the above, this Petition is allowed; the impugned 
Order and Judgment dated 13.09.2023 and 31.10.2023 are set aside; and 
consequently, the Objection Petition of the Respondent stand dismissed. The 
Executing Court is directed to enforce the Decree under execution in 
accordance with law. However, it is clarified that this Judgment will only 
apply to pending proceedings and shall not affect the past and closed 
proceedings which have attained finality.
