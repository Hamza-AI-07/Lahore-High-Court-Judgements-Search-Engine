Date of hearing: 
 22.03.2024. 
Applicant No.1 by: 
Mr. Amir Aqeel Ansari, Advocate.  
Applicant No.2 by: 
M/s Nadeem Iqbal Chaudhry and 
Rana Rizwan, Advocates.  
 
Respondents No.1& 2 by:M/s Hafeez-ur-Rehman Hafeez and 
Rana Ahtisham Shoukat, Advocates.  
 
AHMAD NADEEM ARSHAD, J.  Through this judgment I 
would like to decide the instant application under Section 12(2) of 
the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (C.P.C.) as well as application 
titled “Irfan Azam, etc. V. Rabia Rafique, etc.” (C.M. No.8-C of 
2023) filed under Section 12(2) C.P.C. whereby the applicants have 
called into question the judgment & decree dated 19.10.2020 passed 
by this Court in Civil Revision No.823 of 2018/BWP titled “Irfan 
Azam, etc. V. Rabia Rafiq, etc.” on the grounds of fraud and 
misrepresentation. However, for further discussion Muhammad 
Siddique applicant of C.M. No.7-C of 2023 be referred to as the 
applicant No.1, the applicants of C.M. No.8-C of 2023 be referred to 
as the applicant No.2. Whereas, Rabia Rafique (Rabia Imran) be 

C.Ms No.7-C & 8-C of 2023.

referred to as the respondent No.1 and Ali Imran be referred to as the 
respondent No.2.  
2. 
Facts in brevity are that the applicant No.2 instituted a suit for 
declaration whereby they sought declaration to the effect that they 
are the only legal heirs of deceased Imran Azam whereas 
respondents No.1 & 2 are neither his legal heirs nor entitled to get 
inheritance from his moveable and immoveable properties and only 
they are entitled to get inheritance as per their Sharia shares from the 
agricultural land as well as the amount available in the bank accounts 
of deceased. They also sought a declaration that if respondents No.1 
& 2 have prepared any documents fraudulently to show themselves 
as the widow and son of the deceased, the same are against the facts 
& law, forged and fictitious, a result of collusiveness and having no 
effect upon their rights, void-ab-initio and liable to be cancelled. As 
a consequential relief, they prayed for the issuance of permanent 
injunction that respondent No.1 namely Mst. Rabia Imran alias Rabia 
Rafiq may be restrained permanently from posing herself as the 
widow of Imran Azam deceased and posing respondent No.2 as his 
son; that they also be restrained from claiming any right over the 
moveable and immoveable properties of the deceased, from 
withdrawing amounts from the bank accounts and from getting 
incorporate inheritance mutation in their favour. Respondents No.1 
& 2 resisted the suit by filing a contesting written statement. Besides 
this, they also instituted their independent suit for declaration and 
permanent injunction against the applicant No.2 and sought a 
declaration that the respondent No.1 and Naz Bibi (applicant No.2 of 
C.M No.8-C) being widows and respondent No.2 being son of Imran 
Azam are owners in possession of the property (fully described in the 
plaint) being legal heirs according to their legal and Shari shares and 
challenged the validity and legality of oral sale mutation No.652 
dated 30.06.2011 whereby land measuring 699 Kanals 06 Marlas was 
allegedly alienated to Irfan Azam (applicant No.1 of C.M. No.8-C) 

C.Ms No.7-C & 8-C of 2023.

from Imran Azam deceased. Said suit was contested by the applicant 
No.2.  
3. 
The learned Trial Court consolidated both the suits, framed 
consolidated issues out of the divergent pleadings of the parties and 
invited them to lead evidence in support of their rival contentions. 
After recording evidence of the parties, pro & contra, oral as well as 
documentary, partially decreed the suit of the applicant No.2 by 
declaring Naz Bibi (applicant No.2 of C.M No.8-C) and Rabia Rafiq 
(respondent No.1) as widows and Ali Imran (respondent No.2) as son 
of deceased Imran Azam being his legal heirs, whereas, suit of 
respondents No.1 & 2 was decreed in toto through consolidated 
judgment & decrees dated 15.02.2016. The applicant No.2 
challenged said judgment and decrees by preferring an appeal which 
was dismissed by the learned Appellate Court vide judgment & 
decree dated 19.09.2018. Feeling aggrieved, they filed a revision 
petition (C.R. No.823 of 2018/BWP) before this Court which was also 
dismissed via judgment & decree dated 19.10.2020. Being 
dissatisfied, the applicant No.2 filed C.P.L.A No.1719-L of 2020 
before the august Supreme Court of Pakistan and vide order dated 
04.02.2021 leave was refused and their petition was dismissed. The 
applicant No.2 filed review petition No.Nil of 2021 in C.P.L.A 
No.1719-L of 2020 which was dismissed by the august Supreme 
Court of Pakistan vide order dated 27.01.2023. During the pendency 
of the Review Petition, applicant No.1 namely Muhammad Siddique 
filed the application under Section 12(2) C.P.C. (C.M. No.7-C of 
2023/BWP) against respondents No.1 & 2 by impleading the 
applicant No.2 as rest of the respondents and after dismissal of the 
Review Petition, the applicant No.2 filed an application under 
Section 12(2) C.P.C. (C.M. No.8-C of 2023/BWP) against the 
respondents No.1 & 2 by impleading the applicant No.1 as 
respondent No.3. The applicant No.1 and the applicant No.2 in their 
applications under Section 12(2) C.P.C. challenged the judgment and 

C.Ms No.7-C & 8-C of 2023.

decree dated 19.10.2020 passed in Civil Revision No.823 of 
2018/BWP on the grounds of fraud and misrepresentation.  
4. 
The applicant No.1 in his application maintained that he got 
married to respondent No.1 on 15.06.2006 and as a result of said 
wedlock respondent No.2 was born on 14.12.2006 and this fact is 
evident from the birth certificate of respondent No.2, whereas, 
respondent No.1 got prepared forged documents wherein the date of 
birth of respondent No.2 was shown as 14.12.2010 instead of 
14.12.2006; that respondent No.1 concealed ex-parte judgment and 
decree whereby she got divorce from him on the basis of Khula and 
also concealed said fact at the time of her marriage with Imran Azam, 
therefore, the judgment and decree of this Court is not sustainable as 
having been obtained by practicing fraud and mis-representation with 
the Court.  
5. 
The applicant No.2 in his application maintained that Aneela 
Bibi (applicant No.4 of C.M. No.8-C of 2023) lodged a complaint in 
the year 2020 against respondent No.1 wherein after inquiry it was 
declared that respondent No.1 after the death of Imran Azam with the 
collusion of Molvi Muhammad Gull Gohar (Nikah Khawan), Abdul 
Rauf (Nikah Registrar) prepared ante-dated and forged Nikahnama 
with Imran Azam while making his forged signatures; that as a result 
of inquiry report, F.I.R No.140/2021 dated 29.06.2021 was registered 
against respondent No.1 and her co-accused wherein she was 
arrested and challan was sent to the Court; that respondent No.1 
admitted her Nikah dated 15.02.2006 with the applicant No.1, 
therefore, from this wedlock respondent No.2 was born and his date 
of birth was recorded as 14.12.2006 in the Union Council Ahmadpur 
Lamma, Rahim Yar Khan which falsifies her claim that respondent 
No.2 is son of Imran Azam; that respondent No.1 failed to prove her 
divorce from respondent No.3 as she could not bring on record any 
certificate of divorce issued by concerned Union Council at 
Faisalabad; that respondent No.1 prepared a forged birth certificate 
of respondent No.2 from Filed Office No.12, Behboob Qureshian, 

C.Ms No.7-C & 8-C of 2023.  
 
5
Rahim Yar Khan wherein date of birth of respondent No.2 was 
shown as 14.12.2010 in order to connect his relation with Imran 
Azam; that respondent No.1 filed an application on 21.05.2013 for 
correction of date of birth of respondent No.2 in the record of U.C. 
Ahmedpur Lamma, Rahim Yar Khan which is not decided so far; 
that respondent No.1 refused to get DNA test of respondent No.2 
during the inquiry before the Deputy Commissioner; that respondent 
No.2 was not son of Imran Azam rather he was born from the marital 
tie of respondent No.1 and the applicant No.1; that respondent No.1 
prepared her fake Nikahnama with Imran Azam as well as birth 
certificate of respondent No.2; that respondent No.1 contracted Shari 
Nikah with applicant No.1 on 15.02.2006 and got it registered on 
13.09.2006; that respondent No.1 also contracted marriage with one 
Makhdoom Ahmad Mahmood on 23.07.2002 and got divorce on 
18.09.2004 and out of said wedlock a baby girl Bisma was born 
which fact was not disclosed by her; that respondent No.1 in her 
Nikahnamas showed her as virgin lady and concealed her previous 
Nikah; that she narrated different ages in her respective Nikahnamas; 
that respondent No.1 secured succession certificate of respondent 
No.2 against which appeal of the applicant No.2 is pending; that 
respondent No.1 applied for guardianship of respondent No.2 and the 
applicant No.1 moved an application for impleading him as a party 
wherein he claimed the respondent No.1 as his wife because she 
failed to get divorce certificate from the concerned Union Council; 
that the above referred facts verified the misrepresentation and fraud 
played by respondent No.1 who deceitfully concealed her previous 
marriages with different persons in her suit at all forums during the 
litigation with them and prayed for setting aside the decree dated 
19.10.2020 passed by this Court in C.R. No.823 of 2018 and 
dismissal of suit of the respondents No.1 & 2 with special costs.   
6. 
This Court vide order dated 02.06.2023 issued notice to the 
respondents. Notices were also issued to the respondents in C.M 
No.8-C of 2023/BWP vide order dated 06.07.2023.  

C.Ms No.7-C & 8-C of 2023.

7. 
It is pertinent to mention here that applicant No.1 moved an 
application (C.M. No.1607 of 2024/BWP) and sought framing of 
issues and recording of evidence. The applicant No.2 also moved 
application (C.M. no.1606 of 2024/BWP) whereby they prayed for 
issuance of a direction to the respondents to file written reply of their 
application under Section 12(2) C.P.C.. Both the applications have 
been decided through separate orders.   
8. 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties on the C.Ms and 
perused the record of C.Ms as well as the record of Civil Revision 
No.823 of 2018/BWP with their able assistance.  
9. 
From the scanning of the applications and arguments 
advanced by the learned counsel for the applicant No.1 and the 
applicant No.2, their main allegations are that respondent No.1 
contracted marriage with the applicant No.1 and during the 
subsistence of said marriage she gave birth to a son (respondent No.2) 
on 14.12.2006 which is evident from birth certificate brought on 
record as Annex-A, therefore, respondent No.2 is son of the 
applicant No.1 rather deceased Imran Azam; that the decree of 
dissolution of marriage on the basis of Khula was not effective 
because certificate of divorce was not obtained from the concerned 
Union Council, therefore, respondent No.1 is still legally wedded 
wife of the applicant No.1 and said facts were concealed by the 
respondents No.1 & 2 while obtaining the judgment and decree, 
hence, committed fraud and misrepresentation with the Court.  
10. 
It is evident from the record that the applicant No.2 instituted 
a suit for declaration along with permanent injunction against 
respondents No.1 & 2 on 19.07.2012 by maintaining that they are 
legal heirs of deceased Imran Azam who died issueless on 
27.01.2012 without any male or female issue; that a week ago it 
came to their knowledge that respondents No.1 & 2 made a 
conspiracy to pose respondent No.1 as widow and respondent No.2 
as son of deceased Imran Azam and prepared forged documents in 

C.Ms No.7-C & 8-C of 2023.  
 
7
this regard; that neither Imran Azam contracted marriage during his 
lifetime with the respondent No.1 nor respondent No.2 was born 
from said wed-lock and sought declaration to the effect that they are 
the only legal heirs of deceased Imran Azam, whereas, respondents 
No.1 & 2 are neither his legal heirs nor entitled to get inheritance 
from his moveable and immoveable properties and only they are 
entitled to get inheritance as per their Sharia shares from the 
agricultural land as well as the amount available in the bank accounts 
of deceased. They also sought a declaration that if respondents No.1 
& 2 have prepared any documents fraudulently to show themselves 
as widow and son of the deceased, the same are against the facts & 
law, forged and fictitious, result of collusiveness and having no 
effect upon their rights, void-ab-initio and liable to be cancelled. As 
a consequential relief, they prayed for the issuance of permanent 
injunction that respondent No.1 namely Mst. Rabia Imran alias Rabia 
Rafiq may be restrained permanently from posing herself as a widow 
of Imran Azam deceased and posing respondent No.2 as his son; that 
they also be restrained from claiming any right over the moveable 
and immoveable properties of the deceased, to withdraw amounts 
from the bank accounts and to get incorporate inheritance mutation 
in their favour. 
11. 
The respondents No.1 & 2 resisted the suit by filing contesting 
written statement wherein they took a stance that Imran Azam 
contracted his first marriage with Naz Bibi (applicant No.2 of C.M. 
No.8-C of 2023) but remained issueless despite the lapse of a 
considerable time; that he had an ardent desire to have children, legal 
heir of his property, hence, he contracted second marriage with 
respondent No.1; that in this regard Shari Nikah was performed by 
Qari Nazim in December, 2008; that thereafter deceased Imran Azam 
got registered the Nikah; that in the light of said marital tie a baby 
boy namely Ali Imran (respondent No.2) was born on 14.12.2010. 
Respondents No.1 & 2 also instituted a suit for declaration with 
permanent injunction wherein they challenged the oral sale mutation 

C.Ms No.7-C & 8-C of 2023.  
 
8
No.652 dated 30.06.2011 whereby land measuring 699 Kanals & 06 
Marlas was allegedly shown to be sold by Imran Azam to his brother 
Irfan Azam. The learned trial Court consolidated both the suits and 
framed consolidated issues. The basic controversy between the 
parties was as to who are legal heirs of Imran Azam deceased and to 
resolve said controversy issues No.1 & 3 were framed in the 
following terms: 
1. Whether plaintiffs Irfan Azam etc. are only legal heirs of 
deceased Imran Azam and as such they are entitled to 
the decree for declaration for the suit property? OPP 
Irfan Azam etc.  
2. Whether defendants Rabia Imran etc. are also legal 
heirs alongwith plaintiffs as widow and son of Imran 
Azam and being so they are entitled to the decree for 
declaration regarding suit property? OPD Rabia Imran 
etc.  
 
 
 
 
12. 
In order to substantiate their version, the applicant No.2 got 
examined nine witnesses as P.W.1 to P.W.9 and tendered 21 
documents as Exh.P.1 to Exh.P.21, whereas, respondents No.1 & 2 
produced 13 witnesses as D.W.1 to D.W.13 and placed on record 34 
documents as Exh.D.1 to Exh.D.33 and Mark-A.  
13. 
Perusal of the statements of PWs reflects that they merely 
denied the factum of Nikah of Imran Azam with Rabia Imran and 
birth of their son through their oral evidence. The applicant No.2 did 
not produce any documentary evidence in support of their version.  
14. 
However, to substantiate their stance, respondents No.1 & 2 
produced original Nikahnama as Exh.D.1 and to prove said 
Nikahnama they produced Abdul Rauf Nikah Registrar as D.W.1, 
Molvi Muhammad Gull Gohar Nikah Khawan as D.W.3, Muhammad 
Sajid and Zafar Iqbal witnesses of the Nikah as D.W.4 and D.W.5. 
Both D.W.4 and D.W.5 also deposed that they are witnesses of Shari 
Nikah performed between Imran Azam and Rabia Imran. To prove 

C.Ms No.7-C & 8-C of 2023.  
 
9
the factum of birth of Ali Imran during the marital ties between 
Imran Azam and Rabia Imran, they got examined Dr. Shazia Majid 
Khan Gynecologist as D.W.7. She deposed categorically that she 
conducted a cesarean operation upon respondent No.1 as a result of 
which respondent No.2 was born on 14.12.2010. She produced the  
birth certificate of minor as Exh.D.7. Respondents No.1 & 2 also 
produced Muhammad Arshad Khan Sales Consultant EFU Company 
as D.W.10 who produced a copy of the Insurance Policy as Mark-A. 
In the said policy Imran Azam nominated his son namely Ali Imran 
as his nominee. Muhammad Azam Azad P.W.4 during cross-
examination admitted that Imran Azam had obtained an insurance 
policy from EFU Insurance Company. Tariq Hussain, Project 
Manager, Ramay Developers appeared as D.W.11 and produced the 
original record of allotment of the plot in the name of Irfan Azam 
(applicant No.1 of C.M. No.8-C of 2023). Copy of said record was 
brought on the record as Exh.D.8 wherein said Irfan Azam himself 
nominated Ali Imran son of Imran Azam as his nominee. It is also 
evident that Muhammad Azam Azad P.W.4 was surety in the said 
allotment letter. Said document was prepared on 24.05.2012 and 
bears the thumb impression of Irfan Azam. A copy of CNIC of Irfan 
Azam as well as a copy of CNIC of his wife Ruqiya Bibi was also 
attached with the said application of allotment. NADRA certificate 
was produced as Exh.D.9 wherein Ali Imran is shown as son of 
Imran Azam and Rabia Imran. An application addressed to 
Administrator Union Council G-7 Ahmadpur Lamma from Irfan 
Azam dated 15.06.2012 was available as Exh.D.32. In the said 
application, Irfan Azam maintained that the name of his nephew 
namely Ali Imran s/o Imran Azam is duly entered in the record of 
Union Council and prayed for issuance of its copy.  
15. 
The applicant No.2 failed to rebut the oral as well as 
documentary evidence of respondents No.1 & 2, therefore, the 
learned Trial Court keeping in view evidence available on the record 
declared that respondent No.1 namely Rabia Imran was legally 

C.Ms No.7-C & 8-C of 2023.  
 
10
wedded wife of Imran Azam and from their wedlock a son namely 
Ali Imran was born on 14.12.2010. Said findings remained intact 
upto august Supreme Court of Pakistan.  
16. 
The applicant No.1 in his application admits that respondent 
No.1 got divorce on the basis of Khula through a decree of the Court 
dated 31.03.2008, however, he claims that she is still his wife as she 
failed to obtain the certificate of effectiveness of divorce from the 
Union Council. The decree of Khula obtained through Court would 
not fall under Section 07 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 
1961 which deals with an ordinary divorce given by a husband. The 
matter would, however, fall under Section 08 of the Ordinance ibid 
which deals with other types of divorce or dissolution of marriage. 
For ease, said section is reproduced as under: 
Dissolution of marriage otherwise than by talaq.  
Where the right to divorce has been duly delegated to the wife and 
she wishes to exercise that right, or where any of the parties to a 
marriage wishes to dissolve the marriage otherwise than by talaq, 
the provisions of section 7 shall, mutatis mutandis and so far as 
applicable, apply.  
 
Section 08 of the Ordinance is a parallel provision to Section 
07. The latter provides for the mechanism as to how the divorce by 
‘any man’ who wishes to dissolve the marriage would become 
effective; while the former provision is not confined to Talaq by 
‘any man’. Essentially it relates to other forms of dissolution of 
marriage. Said Section postulates two situations; one, divorce by a 
woman who has right of Tafweez and the other, when the wife sues 
for dissolution of marriage on other grounds including that of Khula. 
In cases of dissolution otherwise than when it is pronounced by a 
man Section 07 with necessary changes would apply.  
With regard to the dissolution of marriage as mentioned in 
Section 8 “the provision of Section 7 shall mutatis mutendis and so far 
as applicable, apply”. Section 08, clearly places a condition on the 

C.Ms No.7-C & 8-C of 2023.  
 
11
application of Section 07 mainly that it would apply “so far as 
applicable” and that also with necessary changes (mutatis mutendis). 
Islamic Law does not permit revocation of dissolution of marriage 
effected through Khula. Section 07 has not changed the Islamic Law. 
Dissolution of marriage under the Family Courts Act, 1964 once 
having attained finality does not make it ineffective merely on the 
ground that notice of decree for dissolution of marriage was not 
given and certificate of effectiveness of said divorce was not issued 
by the concerned Union Council. For the sake of arguments, if it is 
presumed that respondent No.1 failed to give notice of the decree of 
dissolution of marriage, then it related to the question of 
contravention of the provision of Sub-section 01 of Section 07. Sub-
section 02 of Section 07 provides that whosoever contravenes the 
provisions shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term which may 
extend to one year or with a fine which may extend to 5000 rupees or 
with both. From the above discussion, it is crystal clear that non 
sending of a copy of decree after obtaining Khula from the Court 
under Sub-Section 01 of Section 07 or failure to obtain the certificate 
can at the maximum entail penal consequences but cannot invalidate 
the decree of dissolution of marriage on the basis of Khula.     
17. 
During the course of arguments, learned counsel for the 
applicant No.1 argued that the consideration of Khula was not paid, 
therefore, the marriage of respondent No.1 with the applicant No.1 
has not dissolved. Suffice is to say that where marriage was 
dissolved by way of Khula imposing a condition on wife first to 
return the benefits of husband to him, non-fulfillment of that 
condition by wife, would not render decree for dissolution of 
marriage on the basis of Khula as ineffective because imposition of 
such condition merely would create civil liability and decree for 
dissolution of marriage passed by way of Khula, could not be 
considered as dependent on requiring wife to fulfill condition first. 
The decree of dissolution of marriage, on the basis of Khula, even 
though made conditional upon the return of the benefits, would 

C.Ms No.7-C & 8-C of 2023.  
 
12
operate to dissolve the marriage, when it is passed and the effect 
thereof would not be postponed till the benefits were returned. 
Reliance in this regard is placed on the case of “DR. AKHLAQ 
AHMED V. MST. KISHWAR SULTANA & OTHERS” (PLD 1983 
SUPREME COURT 169), where it was observed as under: 
“It was held in the case of Moonshee Buzul-ul-Raheem v. 
Luteefutoon Nisa (8 Moore's Ind. App. 379) that non-payment of 
stipulated consideration for Khula` does not invalidate the 
dissolution of marriage by Khula`. Once the Family Court came to 
the conclusion that the parties cannot remain within the limits of 
God and the dissolution of marriage by Khula` must take place, the 
inquiry into the terms on which such dissolution shall take place 
does not affect the conclusion but only creates civil liabilities with 
regard to the benefits to be returned by the wife to the husband and 
does not affect the dissolution itself.” 
18. 
The applicant No.1 also claims that respondent No.2 is his son. 
In support of his version, he relied upon birth certificate issued by 
Union Council Ahmadpur Lamma wherein the date of birth of 
respondent No.2 is written as 14.12.2006. Although, in the said 
certificate, the name of the child was written as Ali Imran but the 
name of his father was written as Imran Azam and mother’s name  
was written as Rabia Imran. Said entry was made on 10.09.2011. 
Despite the fact date of birth was written in the certificate as 
14.12.2006 but it seems to be a clerical mistake as no corroborative 
material is available in this regard. Said date of birth does not co-
relate and support the version of the applicant No.1 as the date of 
marriage mentioned in the Nikahanama of the applicant No.1 with 
respondent No.1 was 13.09.2006. Although, he took a stance that his 
Shari Nikah was solemnized with respondent No.1 in the month of 
February, 2006 but said fact was not supported through any other 
piece of evidence. Contrary to that, respondents No.1 & 2 proved 
their stance through overwhelming evidence and the competent 
Court of law after discussing the whole evidence declared that 
respondent No.2 is son of Imran Azam who was born on 14.12.2010. 

C.Ms No.7-C & 8-C of 2023.  
 
13
This Court while deciding the Civil Revision in para No.8 of the 
judgment also observed as under: 
“It evince from the record that birth of child took place in 
Hamdani Hospital Sheikh Zaid Road, Rahim Yar Khan, Pakistan 
on 14th December, 2010. To this effect, Dr. Shazia Majid Khan, 
Gynecologist, Hamdani Hospital, Sheikh Zaid Road Rahim Yar 
Khan (DW-7) was examined who stated that she is scribe of birth 
certificate (EX.D-7). It is apparent therefrom that in the birth 
certificate parentage of the minor child is clearly mentioned.”   
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan while dismissing the 
C.P.L.A also observed as under: 
“We have heard the learned counsel for the parties. We have 
noticed that the learned Courts below have rightly appreciated the 
evidence produced by the parties available on the file. We are of 
the view that there is no need of reappraisal, even the argument of 
reappraisal of evidence by the learned counsel is not sustainable. 
There are findings of facts by the three Courts of competent 
jurisdiction against the petitioners. Learned counsel for the 
petitioners failed to make out a case for grant of leave, 
consequently, same is refused and this petition stands dismissed.”   
19. 
It is also argued that respondent No.1 refused to get the DNA 
test of respondent No.2 during the inquiry before the Deputy 
Commissioner, which was necessary to reach a just conclusion. It is 
a trite proposition of law that no one can be compelled to give a 
sample for DNA testing as it would violate his liberty, dignity and 
privacy of a free person guaranteed under Article 14 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. The august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan while elaborating this proposition in its 
judgment titled “MST. LAILA QAYYUM V. FAWAD QAYUM AND 
OTHERS” (PLD 2019 Supreme Court 449), observed as under:  
“Learned Mr. Awan is also right in referring to the case of 
Salman Akram Raja wherein it was held that a free lady 
cannot be compelled to give a sample for DNA testing as it 
would violate her liberty. If a sample is forcibly taken from 
Laila to determine her paternity it would violate her liberty, 

C.Ms No.7-C & 8-C of 2023.  
 
14
dignity and privacy which Article 14 of the Constitution of the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan ("the Constitution") guarantees 
to a free person.”  
 
It was further held that:- 
“There is yet another reason why a DNA should not be

20. 
The provisions of Section 12(2) C.P.C. can only be pressed 
into service when fraud has been practiced upon the Court during the 
proceedings of case and judgment & decree was obtained on the 
basis of such fraud and misrepresentation. The scope of said 
provision is restricted and the applicant is obliged to prove that fraud 
or misrepresentation was committed by the adversary in connection 
with the proceedings of the Court and to prove the following aspects: 
i. 
The fraud and mis presentation was procured during 
the proceedings in the Court;  
ii. 
Alleged 
fraud 
included 
untrue 
statements 
by 
respondents who did not believe to be true and has 
committed active concealment of facts;  
iii. 
Judgment was obtained on the basis of forged 
documents;  
iv. 
The decree was collusively obtained.

A Division Bench of this Court while dealing with said 
proposition in a case titled “MS. SHAZIA ASHRAF V. MUNICIPAL 
COMMITTEE, SAHIWAL THROUGH ADMINISTRATOR AND 
ANOTHER” (2006 CLC 1018) observed as under:  
“The provision of section 12(2), C.P.C. would be attracted only 
when fraud or misrepresentation is alleged in connection with the  
proceeding of the Court and not prior to its initiation or after 
decision of the Court. Reliance is placed on Lal Din and another v. 
Muhammad Ibrahim 1993 SCMR 710; Rehmat Ullah v. Ali 
Muhammad and another 1983 SCMR 1064; Hyesons Sugar Mills 
(Pvt.) Ltd. v. Consolidated Sugar Mills Ltd. and others 2003 CLD 
996 and WAPDA through Chairman and 5 others v. Messrs Sea 
Gold Traders 2002 MLD 19, representation made to the Court 
which is deliberately false, amounts to fraud and would vitiate the 

C.Ms No.7-C & 8-C of 2023.  
 
15
order/decree subject to the exception that mere, falsity of claim to 
the knowledge of the person putting forward the claim would not 
be granted for setting aside the order or decree on the ground of 
fraud.” 
22. 
The applicant No.2 in their suit for declaration sought a 
declaration that they are the only legal heirs of deceased Imran Azam 
and respondents No.1 & 2 are not his legal heirs. Whereas, 
respondents No.1 & 2 had to establish that Imran Azam contracted 
marriage with respondent No.1 and as a result of said wedlock 
respondent No.2 was born. The version of the applicants qua non-
disclosure of earlier marriages, wrong mentioning of marital status 
and mentioning different ages by the respondent No.1 in the 
Nikahnama has no bearing on the merits of the case and does not 
amount to having practiced fraud with the Court. If there is any fraud, 
at best, it is inter-se the parties which do not attract the provisions of 
Section 12(2) of C.P.C. Reference is sought from the case titled 
“SHEIKH MUHAMMAD IFTIKHAR AHMAD AND OTHERS V. 
FAIZ AHMAD AND OTHERS” (2023 SCMR 2158), wherein it was 
held as under: 
“Essentially, no case under section 12(2) of the C.P.C. is made 
out by the Appellants because no fraud was played on the Court. 
If there is any fraud, at best, it is inter se the parties which does 
not attract the provisions of section 12(2) of the C.P.C. Section 
12(2) of the C.P.C. requires that fraud or mis representation be 
played on the court and that consequently the order obtained is 
through fraud or mis-representation.” 
23. 
The remedy of civil suit available for setting aside the 
judgment and decree obtained through fraud and misrepresentation 
prior to the enactment of sub-section 2 of Section 12 C.P.C was 
taken away by this sub-Section but this remedy would not be 
available like a regular suit and the Court may dispose of an 
application under Section 12(2) C.P.C. without framing issues, 
recording evidence of the parties and following the procedure for 
trial of the suit.  

C.Ms No.7-C & 8-C of 2023.

The determination of allegation of fraud and misrepresentation 
usually involves investigation into the question of fact but it is not in 
every case that the Court would be under obligation to frame issues, 
record evidence of the parties and follow the procedure prescribed 
for the decision of the suit. If it were so, the purpose of providing the 
new remedy would be defeated. The framing of issues depends on 
the circumstances of each case, the nature of alleged fraud and a 
decree so obtained. Framing of issues in every case to examine the 
merits of the application would certainly frustrate the object of 
Section 12(2), C.P.C which is to avoid, protracted and the time-
consuming litigation and to save the genuine decree-holder from 
grave hardships and ordeal of further litigation, extra burden on their 
exchequer and simultaneously to reduce unnecessary burden on the 
Courts.  
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in its recent judgment 
while elaborating this proposition in a case titled “HAFIZ MALIK 
KAMRAN AKBAR AND OTHERS V. MUHAMMAD SHAFI 
(DECEASED) THROUGH L.RS. AND OTHERS” (PLD 2024 
Supreme Court 262) held as under: 
“It is a well-settled exposition of law that for determining the 
grounds of alleged fraud, misrepresentation or want of 
jurisdiction, if any, raised in the application moved under section 
12(2), C.P.C., the Court is not obligated in each and every case 
to frame issues mandatorily in order to record the evidence of 
parties and exactly stick to the procedure prescribed for decision 
in the suit but it always rests upon the satisfaction of the Court to 
structure its proceedings and obviously, after analyzing the 
nature of allegations of fraud or misrepresentation, the Court 
may decide whether the case is fit for framing of issues and 
recording of evidence, without which the allegations levelled in 
the application filed under Section 12(2), C.P.C. cannot be 
decided. 
It is correct that the determination of allegations of fraud and 
misrepresentation usually involve investigation into the questions 

C.Ms No.7-C & 8-C of 2023.  
 
17
of fact but it is not in every case that the Court would be under 
obligation to frame issues, record evidence of the parties, and 
follow the procedure prescribed for decision of the suit. If it were 
so, the purpose of providing the new remedy would be defeated. 
The matter is left to the satisfaction of the Court which has to 
regulate its proceedings, and keeping in view the nature of the 
allegations in the application, may adopt such mode for its 
disposal, as in consonance with justice, the circumstances of the 
case may require. Whereas in the case of Mrs. Amina Bibi 
through General Attorney v. Nasrullah and others (2000 SCMR 
296), it was held by this Court that while dealing with the 
allegations under section 12(2), C.P.C., it is not incumbent upon 
the Court that it must, in all circumstances, frame issues, record 
evidence and follow the procedure prescribed for decision of the 
suit. In the case of Amiran Bibi and others v. Muhammad 
Ramazan and others (1999 SCMR 1334), this Court held that 
there is no cavil that determination of allegations of fraud and 
misrepresentation ordinarily involve investigation into the 
questions of fact and in such cases an inquiry should ordinarily 
be held to adjudicate upon the matter in issue but it is not the 
requirement of law that the Court, while dealing with the 
allegation under section 12(2), C.P.C., must in all circumstances 
frame issues, record evidence and follow the procedure 
prescribed for decision of the suit which depends upon the facts 
of each case in consonance with justice.” 
24. 
It is a matter of record that the applicant No.1 filed his 
application under Section 12(2) C.P.C. after the dismissal of CPLA 
filed by the applicant No.2 and during the pendency of review 
petition. Whereas, the applicant No.2 filed an application under 
Section 12(2) C.P.C. after the dismissal of the review petition. After 
the dismissal of the CPLA and review application, ordinarily an 
application under Section 12(2) C.P.C. would not be entertainable. 
The findings of learned Trial Court were maintained by the apex 
Court of the country. This finality cannot be taken away on the 
ground that the applicants were ignorant of some facts. If the 
applicants are permitted to plead their ignorance of lack of 
information to advance their case, then there will be no end to the 

C.Ms No.7-C & 8-C of 2023.  
 
18
litigation. Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case titled “MST. 
DILBAR HAMID V. DR. GHULAM BHEEK KHAN AND OTHERS” 
(1997 SCMR 610), observed as under: 
“The application under Section 12(2) C.P.C simply does not lie 
after dismissal of the review petition by this Court”  
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case titled 
“MUHAMMAD HUSSAIN V. MUKHTAR AHMAD” (2006 SCMR 
71), held as under: 
“To us the proposition canvassed is too naive to merit any serious 
consideration. Out of the pleadings the Court framed the issues 
and tried them. The verdict given by the trial Court has been 
examined by the High Court as well as by this Court and same has 
been finally upheld with the dismissal of the review application by 
this Court. The decree has attained finality. This finality cannot be 
taken away by urging that these petitioners were ignorant of some 
facts. No litigant can be permitted to plead his ignorance or lack of 
information to advance his case. Mr. Dogar is not correct in 
submitting that the improper or incorrect assertion affects the 
jurisdiction of the Court. Jurisdiction on Courts is conferred by 
law and does not depend on the litigants /parties stating correct 
facts in their pleadings. At best, as laid down in Order XLVII, rule 
1(c), C.P.C. discovery of new and important matter or evidence, 
subject to the condition laid therein, may provide a ground for 
review of decree. If what Mr. Dogar is suggesting is accepted, 
there will be no end to litigation and any party can launch a fresh 
round by pleading revelation of facts and his own ignorance and 
lack of diligence.” 
 
In another case titled “MST. SABIRAN BIBI AND OTHERS V. 
AHMED KHAN AND OTHERS” (2008 SCMR 226), observed as 
under: 
“I have carefully considered the submissions made at bar and am 
of the considered view that after dismissal of the CPLA and review 
application ordinarily, an application under Section 12(2) C.P.C. 
would not be entertainable. Furthermore, if a point has not been 
raised at the hearing of the petition and review stage before this 

C.Ms No.7-C & 8-C of 2023.  
 
19
Court, no new point of fact or law can be allowed to be urged in 
the proceedings under Section 12(2) C.P.C.”  
25. 
Once the litigant opted to avail one out of the provided 
remedies, then it generally could not be permitted to initiate the other 
one. The apex Court of the country while discussing the doctrine of 
election in the case reported as “TRADING CORPORATION OF 
PAKISTAN V. DEVAN SUGAR MILLS LIMITED AND OTHERS” 
(PLD 2018 SUPREME COURT 828), held as under: 
“The moment suitor intends to commence any legal action to 
enforce any right and or invoke a remedy to set right a wrong or to 
vindicate an injury, he has to elect and or choose from amongst 
host of actions or remedies available under the law. The choice to 
initiate and pursue one out of host of available concurrent or co-
existent proceeding/ actions or remedy from a forum of competent 
jurisdiction vest with the suitor. Once choice is exercised and 
election is made then a suitor is prohibited from launching another 
proceeding to seek a relief or remedy contrary to what could be 
claimed and or achieved by adopting other proceeding/action and 
or remedy, which in legal parlance is recognized as doctrine of 
election, which doctrine is culled by the courts of law from the 
well-recognized principles of waiver and or abandonment of a 
known right, claim, privilege or relief as contained in Order II, 
rule (2) C.P.C., principles of estoppel as embodied in Article 114 
of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984 and principles of res-
judicata as articulated in section 11, C.P.C. and its explanations. 
Doctrine of election apply both to the original proceedings/action 
as well to defences and so also to challenge the outcome on 
culmination of such original proceedings/ action, in the form of 
order or judgment/decree (for illustration it may be noted that 
multiple remedies are available against possible outcome in the 
form of an order/judgement/decree etc. emanating from 
proceedings of civil nature, which could be challenged/defended 
under Order IX, rule 13 (if proceedings are ex-parte), section 47 
(objection to execution), section 114 (by way of review of an order), 
section 115 (revision), under Order XXI, rules 99 to 103 C.P.C. 
and section 96 C.P.C. (appeal against the order/judgment) etc. 
Though there is no bar to concurrently invoke more than one 

C.Ms No.7-C & 8-C of 2023.  
 
20
remedy at the same time against an ex-parte order/judgment. 
However, once election or choice from amongst two or more 
available remedy is made and exhausted, judgment debtor cannot 
ordinarily be permitted subsequently to venture into other 
concurrently or coexisting available remedies. In a situation where 
an application under Order IX, rule 13, C.P.C. and also an 
application under section 12(2), C.P.C. seeking setting aside of an 
ex-parte judgment before the same Court and so also an appeal is 
filed against an ex-parte judgment before higher forum, all aimed 
at seeking substantially similar if not identical relief of annulment 
or setting aside of ex-parte order/judgment. Court generally gives 
such suitor choice to elect one of the many remedies concurrently 
invoked against one and same ex-parte order/judgment, as 
multiple and simultaneous proceedings may be hit by principle of 
res-subjudice (section 10, C.P.C.) and or where one of the 
proceeding is taken to its logical conclusion then other pending 
proceeding for the similar relief may be hit by principles of res-
judicata. Giving choice to elect remedy from amongst several 
coexistent and or concurrent remedies does not frustrate or deny 
right of a person to choose any remedy, which best suits under the 
given circumstances but to prevent recourse to multiple or 
successive redressal of a singular wrong or impugned action 
before the competent forum/court of original and or appellate 
jurisdiction, such rule of prudence has been evolved by courts of 
law to curb multiplicity of proceedings. As long as a party does not 
avail of the remedy before a Court of competent jurisdiction all 
such remedies remain open to be invoked. Once the election is 
made then the party generally, cannot be allowed to hop over and 
shop for one after another coexistent remedies. In an illustrative 
case this court in the case of Mst.Fehmida Begum v. Muhammad 
Khalid and others (1992 SCMR 1908) encapsulated the doctrine of 
election as follows: 
"However, it is one thing to concede a power to the 
statutory forum to recall an order obtained from it by fraud, 
but another to hold that such power of adjudication or 
jurisdiction is exclusive so as to hold that a suit filed in a 
civil Court of general jurisdiction is barred. I am therefore 
in agreement with my brother that a stranger to the 
proceedings, in a case of this nature has two remedies open 

C.Ms No.7-C & 8-C of 2023.  
 
21
to him. He can either go to the special forum with an 
application to recall or review the order, or file a separate 
suit. Once he acts to invoke either of the remedies, he will, 
on the general principles to avoid a conflict of decisions, 
ultimately before the higher appellate forums, be deemed to 
have given up and forfeited his right to the other remedy, 
unless as held in Mir Salah-ud-Din v. Qazi Zaheer-ud-Din 
PLD 1988 SC 221, the order passed by the hierarchy of 
forums under the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, leaves 
scope for approaching the Civil Court." 
26. 
For what has been discussed above, learned counsel for the 
applicants have failed to substantiate any allegation of fraud, 
misrepresentation committed during the proceedings of suit by the 
respondents No.1 & 2, to upset or overturn the concurrent findings 
recorded up to this Court. Hence, both applications are dismissed 
being meritless and not maintainable.
