filed under section 115 of the Code of the Civil Procedure 
1908 (the ‘Code’), is directed against order dated 
25.09.2020 passed by learned Civil Judge 1st Class, 
Lahore. 
2. 
 
Brief facts of the case are that the respondents 
filed a suit for declaration, cancellation of sale deeds, 
possession and recovery of mesne profits along with 
permanent injunction with respect to property as detailed 
in the suit, which is being contested by the petitioner. Out 
of divergent pleadings of the parties, the learned Civil 
Judge, Lahore framed issues on 19.03.2019 and directed 
the parties to submit their lists of witnesses within seven 
(07) days. In consequence of an application filed by the 
respondents, the learned trial Court reframed certain issues 
on 25.07.2019. After settlement of the issues, the process 
of recording evidence was initiated. The respondents 
completed their evidence, oral as well as documentary, on 
           Form No.HCJDA-38

27.08.2020 and the learned Court fixed the case the 
evidence of the revision-petitioner. On 01.09.2020, the 
revision-petitioner filed an application (hereinafter called 
as the ‘application’), with the following prayer:- 
“It is, therefore, respectfully prayed that the 
application in hand may kindly be accepted 
and the applicant / defendant No.1 may 
please be allowed to file list of witnesses.” 
The application was contested by the respondents by filing 
written reply. On 25.09.2020 the learned trial Court 
dismissed the application. Aggrieved from the same, the 
present revision petition has been filed.  
3. 
 
Mr. Aamir Majeed Rana and Ms. Sana Iqbal, 
learned counsel for the revision-petitioner, have submitted 
that the application for submitting the list of witnesses has 
been turned down by the learned trial Court without 
appreciating the facts of the case; that the list of witnesses 
was submitted by the revision-petitioner within the 
stipulated time period, however, the ahalmad of the Court 
due to rush of work misplaced the original list, therefore, 
the revision-petitioner should not suffer from the fault of 
the Court.  The learned counsel has further contended that 
the order dated 25.09.2020 passed by the learned trial 
Court is illegal and against the facts. No other ground is 
pressed before this Court by the learned counsel for the 
revision-petitioner.    
4.  
 
Conversely, Mian Khalid Habib Elahi, learned 
counsel for the respondents, has vehemently opposed this 
revision-petition. The learned counsel has submitted that 
entire evidence of respondent side has already been 
recorded and the application for placing list of witnesses 
on the record is not merely filed at the belated stage but at 
the same time, if such request is allowed, at this stage, it 

Civil Revision  No. 50670 of 2020 
3
shall cause severe prejudice to the interest of the 
respondent. It is added by the learned counsel that the 
revision-petitioner neglected his duty to follow the law as 
well as order of the learned trial Court and now he is 
falsely attributing the same to the Court’s staff. 
5. 
 
I have heard the arguments and perused the 
documents available on the file with the able assistance of 
the learned counsel of the parties.  
6.  
 
Order XVI Rule 1 of the Code requires the 
parties to provide list of witnesses within seven (07) days 
of settlement of issues. If omission in this regard has taken 
place, it is imperative to obtain permission of the Court. 
The concerned Court is required to see availability of 
‘good cause’ for excuse from such omission, keeping in 
view fact of each case and the attending circumstances. If 
the Court is satisfied as to availability of good cause then 
the permission can be granted for which reasons are 
required to be recorded.  
7. 
 
In order to explain delay of more than one 
year and to satisfy the Court as to the availability of ‘good 
cause’ for not providing the list of witnesses within 
stipulated time, the revision-petitioner has adopted a 
specific stance that the original list of witnesses was filed, 
as directed by the Court, but it was misplaced by the 
ahalmad of the learned Court. These grounds are taken in 
paragraphs No. 2 and 3 of the application, which reads as 
follows:-. 
“2. That this Honourable Court after 
framing issues directed the parties to submit 
their 
list 
of 
witnesses, 
however, 
in 
compliance of order of this Honourable 
Court the counsel of the applicant / 
defendant No.1 submitted list of witnesses 

Civil Revision  No. 50670 of 2020 
4
but the Ahalmad of this Honourable Court 
due to rush of work misplaced the list and 
that’s why he not annexed the same with the 
case file and on the other hand the applicant 
/  defendant No.1 and his counsel are under 
impression that Ahalmad must be placed list 
of witness on file. 
3. 
That now some days ago upon 
examination of the court file it has come to 
the knowledge of the counsel of the 
defendant No.1 that the list of witnesses was 
not placed due to omission by Ahalmad.” 
 
8. 
 
As per the above-reproduced grounds, the 
learned counsel of the revision-petitioner allegedly filed a 
list but it was misplaced by ahalmad of the learned Court. 
Thereafter, it has been asserted in the application that this 
fact came in the knowledge of the learned counsel of the 
revision-petitioner on examination of the Court file. There 
is no fact given in the application that the revision-
petitioner has ever seen or observed or for that matter 
something that is in his direct knowledge. It is also not 
stated in the application that revision-petitioner has ever 
seen or signed the list that was allegedly filed and then 
misplaced due to mistake of ahalmad of the Court, but 
somehow to support above reproduced grounds, an 
affidavit of the revision-petitioner is attached with the 
application. No affidavit of the learned Advocate has been 
provided in order to support the contentions in the 
application. Even no affidavit of anyone from the office of 
the learned Advocate or his clerk is available on the 
record. To make out a prima facie case that an official of 
the Court neglected his duty or misplaced a document, an 
affidavit of a person who could not even depose as to 
those facts, is certainly based on hearsay and the same is 
not sufficient to justify the cause disclosed in the 
application. A learned Division Bench of this Court in 

Civil Revision  No. 50670 of 2020 
5
case titled “Syed Zulfiqar Ali Shah v. Habib Bank Limited 
through Attorney and 7 others” (2006 CLD 139) vis-à-vis 
an affidavit of a litigant having no possibility of having 
knowledge of the facts stated therein, has observed as 
follows:- 
“…It has vaguely and casually been stated, 
as reproduced above, that the learned 
counsel was busy before this Court and in 
the august Supreme Court of Pakistan. The 
applicant has not specifically pleaded and 
failed to narrate as to before which Courts, 
the learned counsel was busy and at what 
point of time. The learned counsel of the 
applicant even did not furnish his affidavit 
and felt contended only by filing the 
affidavit of the applicant in routine. The 
affidavit of the applicant is of no avail to 
him, as he could not depose about the 
alleged engagements of his learned counsel 
before "other Benches of this Court and 
before the august Supreme Court" specially 
in view of the narrative in para.2 of the 
application, 
which 
states 
that 
the 
petitioner/appellant could not be informed 
by the counsel being belonging to outside 
Lahore and for this reason the case 
remained unattended even by the petitioner. 
If said para. of the application be taken as 
true, then applicant's affidavit appears to be 
false, as he could not depose about the 
alleged pre-occupation of the learned 
counsel before any of the Courts as he was 
not in the knowledge of fixation of the 
appeal…” 
 
 
 
          (Emphasis supplied) 
 
9. 
 
It is an admitted fact that no photocopy of the 
list of witnesses that was allegedly filed and then 
misplaced by the ahalmad of the learned trial Court, was 
ever provided to the said Court and instead a fresh list was 
prepared and furnished before the learned trial Court. This 
fresh list is available at page No. 22 of the file of this 
Court, which does not even contain any date. In paragraph 

Civil Revision  No. 50670 of 2020 
6
No. 2 of the application it is stated that the learned counsel 
learnt about the alleged incident of misplacing the 
document upon perusal of record of the learned trial Court 
but no date of gaining such knowledge or inspection of the 
file is mentioned in the application or the present civil 
revision. Today, the learned counsel for the revision-
petitioner was permitted an opportunity to show 
photocopy of the list of witnesses that was prepared on the 
direction of the learned trial Court, however, the learned 
counsel conceded that no photocopy of that list is even 
available in his record / file.  
10. 
 
It seems that after conclusion of evidence of 
respondent / plaintiff and one year after the given time, a 
list of witnesses is sought to be produced on a plea, which 
on the face of it appears to be false and which remained 
unsupported by anything on record or any affidavit of the 
relevant person. There is no cavil to the proposition, after 
the law settled in cases titled “Amjad Khan v. Muhammad 
Irshad (Deceased) through LRs” (2020 SCMR 2155) and 
“Muhammad Anwar and others v. Mst. Ilyas Begum and 
others” (PLD 2013 SC 255), that a party seeking such 
permission has to show ‘good cause’ on the basis of which 
the omission can be excused, which the Court has to see 
while keeping in view the facts and circumstances of each 
case. The parties cannot be granted such permissions, at 
belated stage, as a matter of right or as a matter of course, 
without 
assigning 
or 
establishing 
‘good 
cause’. 
Admittedly, the litigants cannot be made to suffer due to 
fault of Court or its staff but such attribution cannot be 
accepted on the basis of unfounded and groundless or 
unjustifiable statements and which even otherwise remain 
unsupported by affidavit of the relevant person. A similar 
plea, of misplacing list of witnesses by Court-staff, when 

Civil Revision  No. 50670 of 2020 
7
remained unconfirmed by anything from record, has 
already been rejected by this Court in case titled 
“Muhammad Iqbal v. District Judge, Vehari and others” 
(2020 MLD 1760).  
11. 
 
The contention as to misplacing the list of 
witnesses by ahalmad of the Court has no legs to stand on, 
therefore, I agree with the argument of Mian Khalid Habib 
Elahi learned counsel for the respondents that instead of 
showing ‘good cause’ for the omission, a fake and false 
plea has been taken by the revision-petitioner. The 
revision-petitioner has miserably failed to support his 
stance in the application or to show availability of ‘good 
cause’ from the record and circumstances of the case.   
12. 
 
For what has been discussed above, this civil 
revision having no merits is dismissed. No order as to 
costs.
