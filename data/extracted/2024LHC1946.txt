Instant Civil Revision is directed 
against concurrent decisions, in terms whereof, suit for 
specific performance instituted by respondent No.1, was 
decreed by the trial court and affirmed by first appellate court. 
2. 
Facts, essential for adjudication of matter-in-issue, are 
that respondent No.1 claimed entering in agreement to sell 
dated 10.06.2009 regarding land in question - details of 
subject matter land are not in dispute – against claimed 
consideration of Rs.720,000/-, out of which allegedly a sum of 

Civil Revision No. 257/2020. 
 
-:2:- 
 
Rs.200,000/- was paid as earnest money and balance was 
payable by 15.02.2010. It is claimed that petitioner showed 
reluctance in discharging contractual obligations, thereupon 
respondent No.1 was constrained to bring suit, seeking 
enforcement of alleged agreement of 10.06.2009. It is claimed 
that pendente lite proceedings, parties reached compromise, 
allegedly mediated by PW-7 [Mian Imtiaz Ahmad], and 
reduced in writing, identified as Panchayati faisla dated 
10.06.2012 (for the purposes of this decision is referred as 
“mediated agreement”). In terms of mediated agreement 
certain terms and conditions of previous agreement were 
changed, one of which being that cut-off date for performance 
was extended till 15.12.2012. In wake of the compromise, 
statements of the counsels were recorded on 20.07.2012, based 
on the application submitted, signed by the lawyers’ 
representing parties, and mediated agreement was brought on 
record, identified as Mark-A. Trial Court dismissed the suit as 
withdrawn on 20.07.2012. Respondent No.1 brought fresh suit 
in December 2012, claiming enforcement of mediated 
agreement, being a novated contract. Petitioner contested the 
suit, wherein, largely, cause of action to bring suit, on inter 
alia various grounds, was denied. Issues were framed and 
evidence was recorded, where-after trial court proceeded to 
decree the suit with direction to pay balance consideration of 
Rs.520,000/-. 

Civil Revision No. 257/2020. 
 
-:3:- 
 
Petitioner remained unsuccessful before the first appellate 
court. Hence, this Civil Revision. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that original 
copy of mediated agreement was not produced and copy 
otherwise produced was inadmissible. Adds that no novation 
took place and upon withdrawal of earlier suit, without 
permission to re-file it, subsequent suit was not proceedable 
by virtue of bar contained in Order II rule (2) of Code of Civil 
Procedure 1908 (‘CPC’). Submits that respondent No.1 failed 
to prove factum of alleged compromise, when neither the 
attesting witnesses and nor the scribe of alleged mediated 
agreement were produced as witnesses. In support, relies upon 
following decisions, reported as “SIKANDAR HAYAT and 4 others. 
Vs. MASTER FAZAL KARIM.”  (PLD 1971 SC 730), “MUHAMMAD 
YAQOOB. VS. HAKIM ALI.” (2003 MLD 833), “MUHAMMAD

Conversely, learned counsel for respondent No.1 
submits that certified copy of mediated agreement was 
produced, which was part of the judicial record and exhibited - 
Exh.P-3 – without objection. Adds that document was marked 
as Mark-A, which found mention in the joint application and 
referred in the statements recorded on 20.07.2012. Hence, 
certified copy thereof, being a public document, is per se 
admissible. Submits that execution of mediated agreement was 
proved by producing the mediator, Imtiaz Ahmad [PW-7], 
Hasnain Ahmad [PW.5] and one other witness of mediated 
agreement appeared as DW.2, who acknowledged execution 
thereof. Adds that respondent No.1 was not under any 
obligation to prove mediated agreement when factum of 
execution was not denied in the written statement, which 
absence of denial constitute an admission in terms of Order 
VIII rule (5) CPC. Relies upon following decisions, reported

Heard. Record perused. 
6. 
Fundamentally two material issues need to be examined 
and analyzed in context of concurrently passed adverse 
decisions. Firstly, whether mediated agreement was proved or 
at all required to be proved, in wake of claim of absence of 
conspicuous denial in the written statement. And secondly, 
whether subsequent suit could be decreed based on previous 
agreement to sell when claim of novation of contract was 
pleaded by respondent No.1, though not proved, without 
dealing with the question of limitation and bar contained in 
Order II Rule (2) CPC. 
7. 
Before embarking upon determination of determinable 
issues, it is appropriate to discuss the objection regarding 
inadmissibility of mediated agreement [Exh.P-3]. Question of 
admissibility of mediated agreement and proof thereof are 
mutually exclusive concepts, each having independent effect 
and significance under the principles of evidence. There is no 

Civil Revision No. 257/2020. 
 
-:7:- 
 
denial that mediated agreement was part of the application, 
alleging compromise, and it was referred as Mark-A in 
accompanying order of the Court – this brings it within the 
ambit of clause (3) of Article 85 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 
1984 (‘Order 1984’) . In view of this, mediated agreement 
passed test of admissibility. Notwithstanding sorting of 
objection of admissibility, the execution of mediated 
agreement has had to be proved. Learned counsel for 
respondent No.1 emphasized that in wake of admission qua 
execution of mediated agreement in the written statement, 
hence, there was no need to prove admitted facts, hence, 
Article 113 and Article 81 of the Order 1984 are attracted. 
Argument is misconceived and manifest lack of proper 
appreciation of contents of the written statement, which had to 
be read in wholesome manner, instead of referring to few 
paragraphs and otherwise drawing erroneous inferences. 
Contents of written statement are examined, wherein not only 
the cause of action was denied but facts alleged in paragraph 6 
of the plaint were emphatically denied. Petitioner even 
attributed falsity to the facts alleged in paragraph 6 of the 
plaint. Even otherwise, written statement per se has no 
evidentiary value, and anything stated therein cannot per se be 
treated as piece of evidence, unless proved upon meeting 
requirements of confrontation – principles enshrined in Article 
140 of the Order 1984. No suggestion was put to the petitioner 

Civil Revision No. 257/2020. 
 
-:8:- 
 
in the witness box regarding alleged admission qua execution 
of mediated agreement in the written statement, by 
confronting him with contents thereof. In view of this, no 
admission in the pleadings could be conjectured or assumed. 
Now, I take up an issue that whether mediated agreement was 
proved. 
8. 
Respondent was required to prove 
factum of 
compromise reached and execution of Exh.P-3, if at all it 
deserves treatment of a novated agreement. Case pleaded by 
respondent No.1 was that earlier suit was withdrawn in wake 
of compromise reached. It is nobody’s case that petitioner in 
person had appeared before the court on 20.07.2012 – when 
alleged statement regarding compromise was recorded. 
Petitioner was represented through legal counsel, who was not 
produced as witness by the respondent. It is evident that joint 
application, representing compromise, was signed and 
submitted by legal counsels, and in these circumstances, 
testimony of the counsel for petitioner, in proceedings claimed 
to be culminated based on compromise, was vital and failure 
would lead to drawing of adverse inference. Lawyer, who 
represented petitioner, on 12.07.2012, was not produced, 
without any explanation. Petitioner had denied availability of 
cause of action. Mere production of certified copy of the 
application / statements, signed by the lawyers on behalf of 
their respective clients, cannot be treated as alternate for the 

Civil Revision No. 257/2020. 
 
-:9:- 
 
requirement to prove factum of compromise reached, and 
mediated agreement. And respondent failed on this count. 
Admissibility and proof of execution of documents are 
different concepts. 
9. 
Now 
evidentiary 
weightage 
of 
Exh.P-3 
needs 
consideration. Exh.P-3 was mediated under the supervision / 
direction of Pw-7, who, as witness, admitted that mediated 
agreement was drafted by Shahzad Ashraf Mahandara. Scribe 
of Exh.P-3 was not produced without any plausible 
explanation for such inability. This constitutes non-
compliance of Article 78 of Order 1984, which requires that 
handwriting of the author of the document had to be proved. 
Failure of respondent No.1 to produce material witnesses 
fortifies presumption that if those witnesses are produced, they 
are likely to prejudice the case of respondent – this attracts 
principle of adverse inference in terms of Article 129 of 
Qanun-e-Shahadat, 
1984. 
When 
factum 
of 
alleged 
compromise and execution of Exh.P-3 remained disproved, 
plea of novation of contract fails. If there is no novation, no 
question of protection from rigours of Order II Rule (2) of 
CPC could be claimed. Since respondent No.1 had pleaded 
novation, who cannot, upon failing to prove novation, seek 
decree of specific performance on previous contract – which 
otherwise became unenforceable by virtue of limitation, by the 
time subsequent suit was instituted. Learned counsel for 

respondent No.1 misconstrued evidence of DW-2, who stated that 
neither petitioner was present not had signed mediated agreement, 
who further distanced petitioner from the effect of mediated 
agreement by emphasizing that mediated agreement manifest 
settlement of disputes qua other transaction, relating to different 
property. I note with concern that both the courts had not 
considered, let alone adverted too fundamental principles of 
evidence and concept of novation of contract, envisaged in 
Section 62 of the Contract, 1872. I hold that courts had failed to 
appreciate the evidence, deficiencies, going to the root of the 
matter, and conspicuous failure of the respondent No.1 to prove 
entitlement for grant of decree of specific performance, based on 
novated agreement. 
10. 
Judgments referred by the learned counsel may contain 
authorities but in the context of the facts of each case, which 
decisions extends no binding precedent, applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of the case at hand. Assistance rendered is 
appreciated but proximity of the ratio settled in context of present 
case is missing. 
11. 
Civil Revision is allowed and concurrent decisions of both 
the courts below are set aside and consequently the suit of the 
respondent No.1 is, hereby, dismissed. No order as to costs.
