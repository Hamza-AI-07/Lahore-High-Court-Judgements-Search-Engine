This petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 calls in question the 
order dated 1st November, 2023 passed by the National 
Tariff Commission, Government of Pakistan (hereinafter 
referred to as “Commission”) whereby the “Commission” 
decided to initiate sunset review under Section 58 of the 
Anti-Dumping Duties Act, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as 
“Act, 2015”) in order to determine the likelihood of 
continuation or recurrence of dumping of the product under 
review by the exporters/producers of the exporting countries 
and likely continuation or recurrence of material injury to 
the domestic industry. 
2. 
Facts forming background of instant petition are that 
an application was moved by respondent No.3 (hereinafter 
referred to as “respondent”) being the domestic industry, 
before the “Commission”, who started an investigation for 
imposition of the Anti-Dumping duty in terms of Section 23 
of the “Act, 2015”. In furtherance whereof “Commission” 
issued final determination dated 30th March, 2018 imposing 

Writ Petition No.3965 of 2023 
                                               -2- 
 
definitive Anti-Dumping duties on dumped imports of 
certain uncoated writing/printing paper into Pakistan 
originated from Brazil, China, Indonesia, Japan and 
Thailand. Being aggrieved from the final determination 
various exporters as well as importers preferred their 
respective appeals before the Anti-Dumping Appellate 
Tribunal Pakistan (hereinafter referred to as “Tribunal”) 
which were disposed of by way of judgment dated 6th 
August, 2020. After passing of the judgment by the 
“Tribunal” some of the importers preferred their appeals 
before the Islamabad High Court, Islamabad which are 
pending. The grievance of the petitioners is that sunset 
review for Indonesia can only be initiated in terms of 
Section 58 of the “Act, 2015” within five years from the 
expiry of the duty, whereas in the present case as the duty 
was set aside by the “Tribunal” vide judgment dated 6th 
August, 2020, so the matter has become past and closed 
transaction. In response to this petition, the respondents 
submitted their report and parawise comments. 
3. 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties at 
considerable length and perused the record. 
4. 
It is a well-entrenched and settled principle of law that 
before delving into matter in issue, a Court/Tribunal has to 
make sure that it has jurisdiction to ponder upon such issue. 
The question of territorial jurisdiction has though been 
raised by learned counsel representing respondent No.2 but 
halfheartedly. It is an oft repeated principle of law that 
jurisdiction cannot be vested to the court with the consent of 
the parties or at their whims unless it is so equipped under 
the law. Reference to this effect can be made to IZHAR ALAM 
RAROOQI, ADVOCATE versus Sheikh ABDUL SATTAR LASI and 
others (2008 SCMR 240). The relevant extract from the same is 
reproduced below :- 
“6. It is true that a Court which has the jurisdiction to 
adjudicate the dispute and pass an order has also implicit power 
to have the order implemented and mere an erroneous order 

Writ Petition No.3965 of 2023 
                                               -3- 
 
passed by the Court of competent jurisdiction does not render 
the order without jurisdiction. This is an established law that 
jurisdiction cannot be assumed with the consent of the parties 
and notwithstanding the raising of such an objection by the 
parties, the forum taking cognizance of the matter must at the 
first instance decide the question of its jurisdiction. There can 
be no exception to the principle that an order passed or an act 
done by a Court or a tribunal not competent to entertain the 
proceedings is without jurisdiction and that it is mandatory for 
the Court or tribunal as the case may be to attend the question 
of jurisdiction at the commencement of the proceedings 
because the jurisdictional defect is not removed by mere 
conclusion of trial or inquiry and objection to the jurisdiction 
can be raised at any subsequent stage. This Court in Rashid 
Ahmed v. State PLD 1972 SC 271 held as under:-- 
"If a mandatory condition for the exercise of a jurisdiction 
before a Court, tribunal or authority is not fulfilled, then the 
entire proceedings which follow become illegal and suffer 
from want of jurisdiction. Any orders passed in 
continuation of these proceedings in appeal or revision 
equally suffer from illegality and are without jurisdiction." 
Guidance to the above effect can also be sought from Syed 
MUHAMMAD HUSSAIN SHAH versus ABDUL QAYYUM and others 
(2011 SCMR 743), MUNAWAR HUSSAIN and 2 others versus 
SULTAN AHMAD (2005 SCMR 1388) and Pir SABIR SHAH versus 
SHAD MUHAMMAD KHAN, MEMBER PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY, 
N.-.W.F.P. and another (PLD 1995 Supreme Court 66). 
5. 
The petitioners are aggrieved of order of the 
“Commission”, whereby it has decided to initiate sunset 
review under Section 58 of the “Act, 2015” in order to 
determine the likelihood of continuation or recurrence of 
dumping 
of 
the 
product 
under 
review 
by 
the 
exporters/producers of the exporting countries and likely 
continuation or recurrence of material injury to the domestic 
industry.  
6. 
In order to properly appreciate the question of 
territorial jurisdiction it would be advantageous to observe 
that in order to give effect in Pakistan to the provisions of 
Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, 
1994, and to the Agreement on Implementation thereof and 
to amend and consolidate the law relating to imposition of 
anti-dumping duties to offset such dumping, to provide a 
framework for investigation and determination of dumping 
and injury in respect of goods imported into Pakistan and for 

Writ Petition No.3965 of 2023 
                                               -4- 
 
matters ancillary thereto or connected therewith, “Act, 
2015” was promulgated. Part VII of the “Act, 2015” deals 
with initiation and conduct of investigations whereunder 
“Commission” is empowered to conduct investigation upon 
a written application by or on behalf of domestic industry. 
Part IX of the “Act, 2015” deals with investigation 
procedures, preliminary and final determinations. Any 
person aggrieved or interested from the initiation of 
investigation or preliminary determination or even final 
determination can prefer an appeal before the “Tribunal” 
constituted by the Federal Government in terms of Section 
64 of the “Act, 2015”.  
7. 
The respondent No.3 being the domestic industry 
moved an application upon which investigation was started 
by the “Commission” on 15th January, 2016. In furtherance 
of which preliminary determination was made on 21st April, 
2017 which later on matured into final determination on 30th 
March, 2018. Feeling offended from the final determination 
a large number of exporters preferred their appeals before 
the “Tribunal” alongwith two importers i.e. M/s April 
International Enterprise, Private Limited and M/s PT. Indah 
Kiat Pulp and Paper TBK, which are directly related to the 
petitioners being their importers. Through judgment dated 
06th August, 2020 the “Tribunal” proceeded to dismiss all 
other appeals whereas Appeals No.275 & 276 of 2018 were 
remanded to the “Commission” for fresh decision strictly in 
accordance with law after providing an appropriate 
opportunity of hearing to the appellants therein. Due to one 
reason or the other “Commission” could not conduct the 
proceedings and instead after passing considerable period 
issued the impugned notification for sunset review. It is thus 
evident without any hint of doubt that the impugned notice 
is an offshoot of the proceedings which not only came up in 
appeal before the “Tribunal” but the Islamabad High Court, 
Islamabad. In such a case exercise of constitutional 

Writ Petition No.3965 of 2023 
                                               -5- 
 
jurisdiction by this Court under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
would amount to launch parallel proceedings, which would 
certainly result into overlapping and conflicting of 
judgments. Moreover not only the “Commission” but the 
“Tribunal” are established at Islamabad. Even otherwise as 
an outcome of sunset review the matter would again became 
the subject of appeal before the “Tribunal”. In a previous 
round a Full Bench of this Court in M/s Ashfaq Brothers and 
another versus Anti-Dumping Appellate Tribunal of 
Pakistan and others (2023 LHC 484 LHC website), while dealing 
with almost similar issue held as under :- 
“8. Section 70 deals with appellate procedures and it is the 
most pivotal provision for the resolution of the question raised 
before us. The decision of the “Appellate Tribunal” is 
appealable under sub-section (13) of Section 70 of the “Act”, 
which reads as under:- 
 “70.------------------------------------------------------------------  
(1) --------------------------------------------------------------------  
(2) --------------------------------------------------------------------  
(3) --------------------------------------------------------------------  
(4) --------------------------------------------------------------------  
(5) --------------------------------------------------------------------  
(6) -------------------------------------------------------------------- 
(7) --------------------------------------------------------------------  
(8) --------------------------------------------------------------------  
(9) --------------------------------------------------------------------  
(10) ------------------------------------------------------------------- 
(11) -------------------------------------------------------------------  
(12) ------------------------------------------------------------------- 
(13) The decision of the Appellate Tribunal shall be appealable 
in the High Court. The High Court shall render a decision 
within ninety days of receiving an appeal from the decision of 
the Appellate Tribunal:  
 
Provided that the High Court shall not make an interim 
order against the conduct of investigation by the Commission 
unless the Commission has been given notice of the application 
and has had an opportunity of being heard and the High Court 
for reasons to be recorded in writing, is satisfied that the 
interim order would not have the effect of prejudicing or 
interfering with the carrying out of a public work or of 
otherwise being harmful to the public interest [or State 
property] or of impeding the assessment or collection of public 
revenues:  
 
Provided further that The Appellate Tribunal may, if it 
thinks fit accept an application from any party to an appeal in 
which the Appellate Tribunal has rendered its decision, for a 
clarification of any of the issues raised by the Appellate 
Tribunal in its decision: 

Writ Petition No.3965 of 2023 
                                               -6- 
 
Provided also that such application shall specify the precise 
issue in respect of which a clarification is sought and given 
reasons as to why a clarification is necessary”. 
        (underlining supplied for emphasis)  
; 
; 
;  
It is, thus, evident from the above that an appeal against the 
decision of the “Appellate Tribunal“ lies before the High 
Court. 
9. The term “High Court” is nowhere defined in the “Act”. 
This prompted the parties to raise the moot point. Part VII of 
the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
deals with the judicature and Chapter 1 defines the Courts. In 
terms of Article 175(1), there shall be a Supreme Court of 
Pakistan, a High Court for each Province and a High Court for 
Islamabad Capital Territory and such other courts as may be 
established by law. Chapter 3 deals with the High Courts and 
Article 192 provides the composition and jurisdiction of a High 
Court. For ready reference and convenience, same is 
reproduced below:- 
“(1)  A High Court shall consist of a Chief Justice and so 
many other Judges as may be determined by law or, until 
so determined, as may be fixed by the President. 
[(2) The Sind and Baluchistan High Court shall cease to 
function as a common High Court for the Provinces of 
Baluchistan and Sind. 
(3)  The President shall, by Order, establish a High Court for 
each of the Provinces of Baluchistan and Sind and may 
make such provision in the Order for the principal seats 
of the two High Courts, transfer of the Judges of the 
common High Court, transfer of cases pending in the 
common 
High 
Court 
immediately 
before 
the 
establishment of two High Courts and, generally, for 
matters consequential or ancillary to the common High 
Court ceasing to function and the establishment of the 
two High Courts as he may deem fit.  
(4)  The jurisdiction of a High Court may, by Act of 2[Majlis-
eShoora (Parliament)], be extended to any area in 
Pakistan not forming part of a Province”. 
10. It would not be out of context to mention here that initially, 
Islamabad High Court was not in existence and it was 
ultimately established through Act No.XVII of 2010, dated 2nd 
August, 2010. By virtue of Section 4 of the said Act, 
jurisdiction of Islamabad High Court was extended in respect 
of the Islamabad Capital Territory, original, appellate, 
revisional and other jurisdiction, as under the constitution or 
the laws in force immediately before the commencement of the 
Act ibid, which was previously exercisable in respect of the 
said territory by the Lahore High Court. 
11. Article 198 deals with seat of the High Court and reads as 
under:-  
[(l)] Each High Court in existence immediately before the 
commencing day shall continue to have its principal seat at 
the place where it had such seat before that day. 
2[(1A)The High Court for Islamabad Capital Territory shall 
have its principal seat at Islamabad.]  
[(2) Each High Court and the Judges and divisional courts 
thereof shall sit at its principal seat and the seats of its 
Benches and may hold, at any place within its territorial 

Writ Petition No.3965 of 2023 
                                               -7- 
 
jurisdiction, circuit courts consisting of such of the Judges 
as may be nominated by the Chief Justice. 
(3) The Lahore High Court shall have a Bench each at 
Bahawalpur, Multan and Rawalpindi; the High Court of 
Sindh shall have a Bench at Sukkur; the Peshawar High 
Court shall have a Bench each at Abbottabad [, Mingora] 
and Dera Ismail Khan and the High Court of Baluchistan 
shall have a Bench at Sibi [and Turbat.] 
(4) Each of the High Courts may have Benches at such other 
places as the Governor may determine on the advice of the 
Cabinet and in consultation with the Chief Justice of the 
High Court.  
(5) A Bench referred in clause (3), or established under clause 
(4), shall consist of such of the Judges of the High Court as 
may be nominated by the Chief Justice from time to time for 
a period of not less than one year. 
(6) The Governor in consultation with the Chief Justice of the 
High Court shall make rules to provide the following 
matters, that is to say,— 
(a) assigning the area in relation to which each Bench shall 
exercise jurisdiction vested in the High Court; and 
(b) for all incidental, supplemental or consequential 
matters.] 
12. There is no cavil to the proposition that the “Appellate 
Tribunal” is performing functions in connection with the affairs 
of the Federation and it is amenable to writ jurisdiction, but we 
have to examine as to whether in the circumstances, this Court 
can exercise the jurisdiction constitutional or appellate against 
the decision of the “Appellate Tribunal”. It is an admitted fact 
that initially investigation was started by the “Commission” at 
Islamabad, which resulted into passing of order in original. The 
said order was assailed through an appeal before the “Appellate 
Tribunal” under Section 70(1)(2) of the “Act”, who decided the 
same through impugned order. 
13. We have noticed that the cause of action also arose either at 
Islamabad or Karachi and even the appellants before us while 
preferring their appeals before the “Appellate Tribunal” 
mentioned their addresses of places other than Rawalpindi. 
Apparently, the appellants have now changed addresses for 
their convenience or for any other reason best known to them. 
14. It is trite law that the Court cannot assume jurisdiction on 
the whims of the parties or to facilitate any of them. We cannot 
ignore the doctrine of forum non conveniens. It is founded on 
the principle that if some other forum is more appropriate and 
the interest of justice would be served better, the Court may 
decline to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that a case could 
be suitably tried by another Court. The above doctrine has 
come under discussion before this Court in HASSAN 
SHAHJEHAN vs. FPSC through Chairman and others (PLD 
2017 Lahore 665) and while outlining the scope and object of 
the same, it was held as under:- 
“19. Another dimension of the case is the principle of 
forum non conveniens which is a discretionary power that 
allows courts to dismiss a case where another court, or 
forum, is much better suited to hear the case. This dismissal 
does not prevent a plaintiff from refiling his or her case in 
the more appropriate forum: The doctrine allows a court 
with jurisdiction over a case to dismiss it because the 
convenience of the parties and the interest of justice would 
be better served if the case were brought in a court having 
proper jurisdiction in another venue. "The doctrine of 

Writ Petition No.3965 of 2023 
                                               -8- 
 
forum non conveniens, i.e., that some other forum is more 
"appropriate" in the sense of more suitable for the ends of 
justice, was developed by the Scottish courts in the 
nineteenth century, and was adopted (with some 
modifications) in the United States. The Scots rule is that 
the court may decline to exercise jurisdiction, after giving 
consideration to the interests of the parties and the 
requirements of justice, on the ground that the case cannot 
be suitably tried in the Scottish court nor full justice be 
done there, but only in another court. The basic principle is 
that.... the court is satisfied that there is some other 
available forum, having competent jurisdiction, which is 
the appropriate forum for the trial of the action, i.e. in 
which the case may be tried more suitably for the interests 
of all the parties and the ends of justice. Applying this 
principle to the facts of the present case, the matter in 
hand, can best be resolved at the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan.  
Guidance to the above effect can also be sought from 
SANDALBAR ENTERPRISES (PVT.) LTD. vs. CENTRAL 
BOARD OF REVENUE and others (PLD 1997 Supreme 
Court 334) and Let.-Gen.(R) SALAHUDDIN TIRMIZI vs. 
ELECTION COMMISSION OF PAKISTAN (PLD 2008 
Supreme Court 735).  
15. In somewhat similar circumstances, in the case of Messrs 
KARACHI IRON AND STEEL MERCANTS ASSOCIATION 
through Authorised Representative and 30 others vs. ANTI-
DUMPING APPELLATE TRIBUNAL and 22 others (2021 
PTD 1150), the learned Sindh High Court observed as under:- 
“6. It is an undeniable position that the appellant(s) did 
contest the matter before the Tribunal, constituted at 
Islamabad over which this Court has got no administrative 
control therefore, mere plea of 'convenience' is never 
sufficient for choosing the Court(s) rather it is always the 
commandment of the law and law alone which describes 
the 'jurisdiction'. Failure of the Federation in establishing 
Tribunal(s) at other provinces is also no ground to press 
right of convenience. Further, the matter appears to be 
between the parties alone hence the same, legally, can't be 
taken as having applicability thereof on people at large. It 
is conducive to refer the case of Rashid Latif v. Federation 
of Pakistan through Secretary Ministry of Inter Provincial 
Coordination (PLD 2014 Karachi 135 (authored by me in a 
DB matter) wherein the issue of jurisdiction is discussed in 
detail while discussing all the citations. The conclusion was 
that in case an action of Federation, if affecting community 
or public at large then same may be challenged before 
High Court of other province, too but if the same is 
personam relating to any party then the jurisdiction would 
lie with the High Court of the area where order is passed. 
7. Here the situation is different as the Tribunal is 
constituted at Islamabad. Admittedly the appeals preferred 
by the appellants at Islamabad Tribunal and all parties 
contested their case at Rawalpindi Bench in FAO, against 
the said order four appeals are filed at Islamabad High 
Court, hence I agree with the same referred observation 
and hold the present appeal(s) to be incompetent. 
Accordingly, captioned appeals are dismissed on the point 
of jurisdiction”.  
16. 
So 
far 
judgment 
in 
the 
case 
of 
TRADING 
CORPORATION OF PAKISTAN (supra) heavily relied upon 

Writ Petition No.3965 of 2023 
                                               -9- 
 
by the learned counsel for the appellants is concerned, it is 
observed that in the said case, facts were entirely different. 
Moreover, said judgment was rendered by the Hon’ble Apex 
Court with reference to Article 199 of the “Constitution”. 
17. 
Though 
learned 
counsel 
has 
also 
relied 
upon 
MUHAMMMAD FAYYAZ vs. FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN 
and others (2022 PTD 399), but we have no hesitation to 
observe that a question of territorial jurisdiction was though 
raised before the learned Single Judge, but it was not at all 
consciously attended or responded by the Court. 
18. The crux of above discussion is that word “High Court” 
used in sub-section (13) of Section 70 of the “Act” corresponds 
to Islamabad High Court and, as such, this Court lacks 
territorial jurisdiction to ponder upon the decision of the 
“Appellate Tribunal”.” 
8. 
To betterly understand the core issue one can also 
seek guidance from HASSAN SHAHJEHAN versus FPSC through 
Chairman and others (PLD 2017 Lahore 665) wherein it is held as 
under :- 
“12. 
What does "Within the territorial jurisdiction of this 
Court" mean? Relying on our constitutional jurisprudence 
developed over the years and the provincial constitutional 
architecture of a High Court, writ cannot be issued by High 
Court against any person which is located geographically 
outside the territorial limits of the Province, having no physical 
or legal presence within the Province. See: Sandalbar 
Enterprises (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Central Board of Revenue and others 
(PLD 1997 SC 334), Flying Kraft Paper Mills (Pvt.) Ltd., 
Charsadda v. Central Board of Revenue, Islamabad and 2 
others (1997 SCMR 1874), Asghar Hussain v. The Election 
Commission Pakistan (PLD 1968 SC 387), Messrs Al-Iblagh 
Limited, Lahore v. The Copyright Board, Karachi and others 
(1985 SCMR 758) and Messrs Sethi and Sethi Sons through 
Humayun Khan v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, 
Ministry of Finance, Islamabad and others (2012 PTD 1869). 
13. 
It is trite law that if the order or action of the 
Government or Authority (federal or provincial), present within 
the Province, affect the rights of a person within the Province, 
writ can be issued against the said Government or Authority 
(irrespective of its federal character) and relief given to the 
aggrieved person located within the Province. 
14. 
The impugned Press Note dated 13.04.2016 does this 
and more, as it provides for quota for all the Provinces. 
Granting the prayer of the petitioner and striking down the 
Press Note would grant relief to the people of Punjab but 
simultaneously upset quotas belonging to the people of other 
Provinces and Areas. This would amount to issuing a writ 
beyond the territorial limits of the Court. A Provincial High 
Court can only grant relief to people of the Province and 
cannot meddle into the affairs of the other Provinces or affect 
the rights and privileges of the people of the other Provinces or 
Areas. 50% quota allocated to the Province of Punjab under the 
impugned Press Note is not inseparable from the quotas 
allocated to the other Provinces, hence striking down the Press 
Note will deprive the quota allocated to all the other Provinces 
and Areas. Any such writ issued by this Court would also 
amount to transgressing the territorial limits of the Province. So 

Writ Petition No.3965 of 2023 
                                               -10- 
 
while technically, for the sake of argument, writ can be issued 
and relief can be granted to the people of Punjab by abolishing 
their quota, it would also, at the same time, have the effect of 
abolishing the quota of other Provinces and Areas. This unique 
situation begs the question; whether issuance of a writ as 
prayed for in this case, is constitutionally impermissible or 
inappropriate? 
15. 
In order to answer the above question, let's revisit the 
federalist structure of our Constitution. "The commonly 
accepted features of a federal constitution are: (i) existence of 
two levels of government; a general government for the whole 
country and two or more regional governments for different 
regions within that country; (ii) distribution of competence or 
power - legislature, executive, judicial, and financial — 
between the general and the regional governments; (iii) 
supremacy of the constitution — that is, the foregoing 
arrangements are not only incorporated in the constitution but 
they are also beyond the reach of either governments to the 
extent that neither of them can unilaterally change nor breach 
them; (iv) dispute resolution mechanism for determining the 
competence of the two governments for exercising any power 
or for performing any function. Federalism is in fact the basis 
of the division of powers...The principle of Federalism is a 
central organizational theme of the constitution and represents 
a political and legal response to underlying social and political 
realities... A federal system of government allows different 
provinces to pursue specific policies tailored to the particular 
concerns and interests of residents in that province. The 
Principle of Federalism also enables provinces to enact specific 
statues to pursue specific collective goals, and may promote 
different cultures and linguistic minorities within a specific 
province or areas. At the same time federalism allows citizens 
to construct and achieve goals on a national scale through a 
Federal Government acting within the limits of its jurisdiction. 
Consequently, federalism is key to enable citizens to 
participate in different collectivities and to pursue objectives at 
local, provincial and national levels. 
16. 
Federalism or Federal Principle under our Constitution 
envisages independent federating units with autonomous 
legislature, executive and judiciary. Chapter 1 of Part V of the 
Constitution provides for distribution of legislative power 
between the Federation and the Provinces. Chapter 2 of the 
same Part deals with distribution of executive power between 
the Federation and the Provinces. Chapters 1 to 3 of Part-VII 
deal with Judicature and the vertical sharing of jurisdiction 
between the Supreme Court of Pakistan and the High Courts, 
as well as, the horizontal jurisdictional limits between the High 
Courts. The Constitution provides a separate High Court for 
each Province and a Supreme Court of Pakistan with an 
overarching jurisdiction with an overlapping power with the 
High Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution. The 
provincial jurisdictional limits, delineating judicial power 
between co-ordinate High Courts on the basis of territory and 
the vertical overlap of judicial power under Article 184(3) 
between the High Court and the Supreme Court of Pakistan is 
judicial federalism. Every Provincial High Court and the High 
Court of the Islamabad Capital Territory has its own 
jurisdictional space. Any order passed by a High Court is, 
therefore, effective in the Province and has merely a non-
binding persuasive value in other Provinces. Province is a 
federating unit and has its own legislature, executive and

                                               -11- 
 
judiciary. Similarly, within the Province, the provincial High 
Court also functions on the same Federal Principle and 
exercises judicial power within the limited provincial 
jurisdictional space or within the Islamabad Capital Territory.” 
9. 
In recent past in the case of TAUFIQ ASIF and others 
versus General (Retd.) PERVEZ MUSHARRAF and others (PLD 2024 
Supreme Court 610) Supreme Court of Pakistan held as 
under:- 
“14. 
In the present case, the main grievance agitated and 
the ultimate relief sought by the respondent in his writ 
petition were about the acts done and the proceedings taken 
by the Special Court at Islamabad. Over such acts and 
proceedings, only the Islamabad High Court enjoyed 
territorial jurisdiction, and only the Islamabad High Court 
could judicially review the legality thereof under Article 
199(1)(a)(ii) of the Constitution. The Lahore High Court had 
no such jurisdiction; it wrongly assumed and exercised the 
jurisdiction that was not vested in it by the Constitution with 
regard to the acts done and proceedings taken outside its 
territorial jurisdiction.” 
After having an overview of the principles laid down in the 
above quoted precedents, I am of the considered view that 
territorial jurisdiction with regard to the matter in issue lies 
with the Islamabad High Court, Islamabad and this Court is 
precluded to exercise its jurisdiction under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. 
Resultantly office is directed to return this petition to the 
petitioners in terms of Order VII Rule 10 of the Code of 
Civil Procedure (V of 1908), so as to be presented before the 
Court concerned (Islamabad High Court, Islamabad).
