It has been further mentioned in the complaint (Ex.PB) that 
complainant alongwith his family members was searching his paternal 
nephew Muhammad Basit alias Arzanish; on 12.09.2020 Asif Ali s/o Ashiq 
and Javed Iqbal met the complainant and told him that on 09.09.2020 in the

complainant about the occurrence turn by turn upon which complainant 
believed that both accused persons have murdered his paternal nephew while

persons were employees of Bureau of Statistics, Nankana Sahib where Basit 
alias Arzanish (deceased of the case) developed relations with Mst. Shumaila

6. 
Arguments heard.  Record perused. 
7.   
It has been noticed that as per case of prosecution, Muhammad Basit 
alias Arzanish (paternal nephew of the complainant) went to his job                      
on 09.09.2020 but did not come back, however, matter was not promptly 
reported to the police by Muhammad Waqar Adil (complainant/PW-1) rather 
with delay on 10.09.2020 at 06:50 p.m.; in this regard, relevant portion of 
statement of complainant (PW-1) is hereby reproduced: - 
“On 09.09.2020 at 10:00 pm to 10.09.2020 till 07:00 pm I have not 
informed the police about the occurrence.” 
 
As per application (Ex.PA/1) moved by Muhammad Waqar Adil 
(complainant/PW-1) for registration of case, Muhammad Basit alias Arzanish 
(paternal nephew of the complainant) went to his job but did not come back, 
he was contacted through phone by the complainant whereupon he replied that 
he is at bridge of Morr Khanda Canal and will shortly (تھوڑی دیر تک) come to 
home but did not reach home, however, any voice transcript of said phone call 
between the complainant (PW-1) and deceased of the case could not be 
produced by the prosecution to prove said fact. Bridge of Morr Khanda Canal 
is at a considerable distance i.e. 20 k.m. from the alleged place of throwing 
Muhammad Basit alias Arzanish into the canal and relevant portion of 
statement of the complainant (PW-1) is reproduced: - 
“The inter-se distance of More Khunda canal and QB canal bridge is 
about 20km.” 
 
even otherwise, this piece of evidence does not tell anything about the 
occurrence or the accused, hence of not much evidentiary value against the 
appellants.  
 
Prosecution produced another piece of evidence i.e. last-seen 
comprising of statements of Muhammad Mursaleen (PW-2) and Khaliq 
Hussain (PW-3), who claimed that they work as “property dealers” and                  
on 09.09.2020 went to Mandi Faizabad in connection with some property; on 
their return, they stopped motorbike at Cigarette Corner situated at Q.B. Link

Canal, Lahore near Jaranwala Road to purchase cigarette where they saw in 
the light of bulb that Asif Ali, Tauseef (present appellants) and Muhammad 
Basit alias Arzanish (now deceased of the case) were having cold drinks; 
however, they neither could tell the distance between their village and Mandi 
Faizabad where they had gone nor could prove the cause for which statedly 
they had gone there; in this regard, relevant portion of statement of 
Muhammad Mursaleen (PW-2) is hereby reproduced: - 
“I do not know the distance in between Faizabad and my village and 
Faizabad and Dhari Bhattian. During investigation as well as in this 
private complaint I did not produce any my visiting card, my office 
picture, pad of business as property dealer.”  
 
Similarly, relevant portion of statement of Khaliq Hussain (PW-3) is 
reproduced as under: - 
“I do not know the distance in between Faizabad and my village and 
Faizabad and Dhari Bhattian. During investigation as well as in this 
private complaint I did not produce any my visiting card, my office 
picture, pad of business as property dealer.”  
 
 
Site plan (Ex.CW-14/BB) produced by the prosecution during trial of the case 
does not reflect presence of said witnesses at aforestated place as well as of 
the appellants and deceased of the case “with cold drinks” and even any 
shop/stall/Khokha "کھوکھا" of cold drinks/cigarettes is not mentioned therein; 
said site plan also does not show availability of any bulb there and even any 
shop keeper of shop/stall/Khokha "کھوکھا" of cold drinks/cigarettes neither 
joined the investigation nor was produced during trial of the case. Any other 
site plan showing said place where these both witnesses saw appellants and 
deceased with cold drinks is not available on record. Both said witnesses even 
did not produce their motorcycle during trial of the case.  
  
Statements of Muhammad Mursaleen (PW-2) and Khaliq Hussain 
(PW-3) were not recorded under Section: 161 Cr.P.C. and in this regard, 
any application was also not moved by the complainant to the police high 
ups; relevant portion of statement of the complainant (PW-1) in this regard 
is reproduced as under: -  
“The statements of PWs Khaliq and Mursaleen u/s 161 Cr.P.C. have 
not been recorded by the investigating officer and in this regard I have 
not moved any application to the high ups of the police and first time 
this fact has been narrated by me in private complaint.”  
 
Both aforementioned witnesses i.e. Muhammad Mursaleen (PW-2)             
and Khaliq Hussain (PW-3) are not resident of said place i.e. Q.B. Link 
Canal or its surrounding, so, they are “chance witnesses”, who could not

establish any plausible reason regarding their presence at relevant “time & 
place” of occurrence as detailed above; furthermore, these witnesses were 
introduced at belated stage in complaint (Ex.PB) filed in June, 2021.  
  
It is relevant to mention here that dead body of the deceased was not 
found at the place where statedly both aforementioned witnesses saw the 
appellants with deceased; in this regard, relevant portion of statement of 
complainant/PW-1 is reproduced as under: -  
  “The place where the dead body recovered at a distance of 05/06 km 
from QB link canal bridge.”  
 
So, testimony of these both witnesses is not confidence inspiring; even 
otherwise, evidence of last-seen being weakest type of evidence requires 
strong corroboration which is missing in the case; in this regard, case of 
“ALTAF HUSSAIN versus FAKHAR HUSSAIN and another” 
(PLJ 2008 SC 687) can be safely referred and relevant portion from its 
Paragraph No.7 is reproduced below: - 
“It is settled principle of law that the last seen evidence is a 
weakest type of evidence unless corroborated with some other 
piece of evidence which is conspicuously missing in this case. This 
piece of evidence has been disbelieved by the trial Court as well 
as learned High Court and rightly so. So far as circumstantial 
evidence is concerned it does not lead to the conclusion in any 
manner that the respondent had any hand in the affair and caused 
the murder in question. Needless to emphasis that all the pieces of 
evidence should be so linked that it should give the picture of a 
complete chain, one corner of which should touch the neck of the 
deceased and other corner to the neck of the accused. Failure of 
one link will destroy the entire chain.” 
 
Further guidance on the subject can also be sought from the case of 
“MUHAMMAD ABID versus THE STATE and another” (PLD 2018 
SC 813).  
  
Now coming to direct evidence produced by the prosecution 
comprising of statements of Javed Iqbal (PW-4) and Asif Ali (PW-5), who 
claimed that on 09.09.2020 they had gone to Mouza Kotowala for meeting 
with Haji Shah Muhammad Arain, who was not available in his house, they 
remained waiting for him but he did not come back and his brother Nazir 
Ahmad met them there and thereafter they were coming back on car 
bearing registration No.FSB/857 to their house, at about 10:30 p.m. they 
reached on Bridge Q.B. Link Canal where they saw in the light of their car, 
that Asif Ali and Tauseef (present appellants) were scuffling with unknown

person aged about 21/22 years and in their view, Asif Ali and Tauseef 
(present appellants) caught hold arms of unknown person, pushed him in 
Q.B. Link Canal, Jaranwala Road, they identified Asif Ali and Tauseef in 
the light of their car and it came into their knowledge that Muhammad 
Waqar Adil (complainant/PW-1) and his family members were searching 
Muhammad Basit alias Arzanish (deceased), they called the complainant 
and told said fact. It goes without saying that prosecution did not produce 
aforestated Nazir Ahmad to establish the fact that both said witnesses had 
gone to Mouza Kotowala and met him on said day; in this regard, relevant 
portion of statement of Javed Iqbal (PW-4) is reproduced as under: - 
 “I did not produce Nazir Ahmad before the police.”  
 
Similarly, relevant portion of statement of Asif Ali (PW-5) is as under: - 
“I did not produce Nazir Ahmad before the police.”  
 
Aforementioned witnesses further stated that when they were coming back 
at 10:30 p.m. they saw that appellants were scuffling with unknown person 
aged about 20/21 years and pushing him in the canal and they saw the 
occurrence in the lights of their car, meaning thereby that their only source 
of identification of the appellants as well as victim was “lights of car” but 
said car has not been produced during trial of the case; furthermore, they 
did not raise any alarm/hue and cry and in this regard, relevant portion of 
statement of Javed Iqbal (PW-4) is reproduced: - 
“I did not raise any alarm at bridge of QB Link Canal.”  
 
They did not try to save the victim or overpower/apprehend the appellants 
although appellants were just two in number and not armed with any 
weapon and if these witnesses, who were also two in number had 
intervened for saving the victim, then they alongwith victim could had 
become three in number and it was very easy for them to rescue the victim 
and  overpower/apprehend the accused but they did not do so rather in their 
view, they let the appellants to complete their task i.e. throwing the victim 
in the canal and remained there as silent spectators; furthermore, they did 
not apprehend the appellants even after the occurrence and let them escape 
from there on their motorbike although witnesses were having car with 
them but they neither stopped the appellants nor chased them; police post 
was very much near from there i.e. just at a distance of 25/30 meter and in

this regard, relevant portion of statement of Javed Iqbal (PW-4) is 
reproduced as under: - 
“Police Chowki is 25/30 meter away from the QB link bridge towards 
Mangtanwala side.”  
 
but they did not call for help from said police post; copy of any written 
application or intimation or statement about giving intimation regarding the 
occurrence by both witnesses (mentioned above) to said police post has not 
been produced during trial of the case; any witness from said police post to 
establish that these both witnesses went to said police post to report said 
incident has not been produced before the Court. Furthermore, both 
aforementioned witnesses claimed that many shops and houses were there 
at said place; in this regard, relevant portion of statement of Javed Iqbal 
(PW-4) is reproduced as under: - 
“There are residential houses as well as shops on both side of QB Link 
Canal Bridge.”  
 
but even then they did not raise any alarm and their said conduct is not 
natural rather raises eyebrows; even otherwise when on bank of canal there 
might had been many places having no population, shops, residences or 
police post and it was easy for the appellants to complete task by throwing 
Muhammad Basit alias Arzanish in the canal there but why they opted 
place for throwing him into the canal which is surrounded by shops, houses 
and police post, is a question mark and this version does not appeal to a 
common prudent man rather possibility cannot be ruled out that this place 
has been introduced as place of throwing Muhammad Basit alias Arzanish 
into the canal just to show presence of witnesses and seeing the occurrence; 
said both witnesses are not residents of said place and having no business 
over there; in this regard, relevant portion of statement of Javed Iqbal  
(PW-4) is reproduced as under: - 
“I have no shop or business in surroundings of QB Link Canal 
Bridge.”  
 
similarly, relevant portion of statement of Asif Ali (PW-5) is reproduced 
below: - 
“I have no shop or business in surroundings of QB Link Canal 
Bridge.”  
 
So, they are also “chance witnesses” who could not establish any plausible 
reason for their presence over there particularly when they neither 
produced Nazir Ahmad (mentioned above) during trial of the case nor

produced their aforementioned car. It is common practice that if some 
one’s nearer or dearer goes missing then first of all he establishes contact 
with the persons who are closely related to him for two reasons i.e. for 
inquiring about presence of missing person with them and second for 
intimating them regarding his missing; it is own claim of the complainant 
that Muhammad Mursaleen (PW-2), Khaliq Hussain (PW-3), Javed Iqbal 
(PW-4) and Asif Ali (PW-5) were having close relationship with the 
complainant; in this regard, relevant portion of statement of the 
complainant (PW-1) is reproduced as under: - 
“I have no blood relation with Khaliq and Mursaleen, Asif and Javed 
PWs however I have close relationship with them.”  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    (emphasis added) 
 
Now question does arise that why the complainant did not immediately 
establish contact with said witnesses for inquiring presence of Muhammad 
Basit alias Arzanish with them or at least to intimate them that Muhammad 
Basit alias Arzanish is missing; furthermore, when Javed Iqbal (PW-4) and 
Asif Ali (PW-5) were having close relationship with the complainant (as 
mentioned above) and Muhammad Basit alias Arzanish (deceased) was 
real paternal nephew of the complainant, then why they both did not 
identify Muhammad Basit alias Arzanish (mentioned above) when they 
saw that appellants were scuffling with him and why they did not intervene 
or why they did not immediately intimate the complainant and if it is 
supposed for a moment that they had not earlier seen Muhammad Basit 
alias Arzanish and thus could not identify him, then it was mandatory for 
the prosecution to get dead body of Muhammad Basit alias Arzanish after 
its recovery to be identified by these witnesses i.e. Javed Iqbal (PW-4) and 
Asif Ali (PW-5) to establish that it was dead body of the same person who 
was seen by them scuffling with the appellants and thrown by the 
appellants into the canal but this mandatory exercise has not been done, 
which is fatal omission for the prosecution. Therefore, for the 
aforementioned reasons, this piece of evidence has lost its efficacy and its 
evidentiary value is nil hence of no help to the prosecution.  
 
In view of above, both pieces of evidence i.e. last seen and direct 
evidence are neither confidence inspiring nor reliable, hence, discarded.

It goes without saying that as per statement of Dr. Danish Tamoor 
Ghazi (CW-15), dead body of the deceased was not identifiable, time 
between injury and death could not be ascertained, unnatural cause of death 
could not be ascertained and the doctor could not tell conclusively that 
death of the deceased was caused due to throwing in canal or dead person 
was thrown in the canal and at the time of postmortem examination, dead 
body was completely decomposed and unidentifiable; relevant portions of 
statement of Dr. Danish Tamoor Ghazi (CW-15) are reproduced below: - 
 
“Putrefaction of body was found and grossly evident.” 
“Probable Time And That Elapsed:  
A. Between injury and death cannot be ascertained.” 
 
“So in view of the difference between physical and hispathological and 
toxicological examination from PFSA I am of the opinion that un-
natural cause of death cannot be ascertained in this case.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    (emphasis added) 
 
“I cannot tell conclusively that death of deceased was caused due to 
throwing in canal or dead person was thrown in the canal. Volunteered 
that as per histopathology report from PFSA regarding diatom tests for 
drowning the report was negative indicative of results not 
corresponding to drowning as a cause of death but physical 
examination during the post-mortem revealed changes indicative of 
drowning. ” 
 
“It is correct that the at the time of post-mortem examination dead 
body was completely decomposed and unidentifiable.” 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
    (emphasis added) 
 
 
Similarly, as per statements of officials of Rescue 1122 (who recovered the 
dead body  of the deceased from the canal) i.e. Yasir Javed (CW-1), Kamran 
Ali (CW-2), Khalid Mehmood (CW-3), Sajid Hussain (CW-4), Muhammad 
Saeed Akram (CW-5), Maqsood Ali (CW-6) and Muhammad Anwar (CW-7), 
condition of dead body was un-identifiable; relevant portion of statement of 
CW-1 is reproduced as under: - 
“It is correct that condition of dead body was un-identifiable.” 
 
So, medical evidence did not support/confirm ocular version of the 
prosecution.  
 
So far as recovery of mobile phones, SIMs and C.D.R. is concerned, 
suffice it to say that ownership of said mobile phones has not been duly 
proved; documents issued by cellular company qua ownership of SIMs also 
could not be brought on record and proved. Call Data Record (CDR) merely 
shows presence of SIMs in territorial jurisdiction/area of cellular phone 
tower and not the person carrying the SIM and it also does not show that the

persons using the same are present together. Mere CDR without voice 
transcript, is of no avail to the prosecution; in this regard, case of                   
“Mst. Saima Noreen vs The State and another” (2022 LHC 8798) can be 
advantageously referred and relevant portion from the same is hereby 
reproduced: - 
“10. Although any accused or witness can claim or admit possession 
and use of any SIM “Subscriber Identity Module’ by him or anybody 
else at the time of occurrence or any other relevant time yet mere 
such claim or admission is not sufficient for relying on CDR “Call 
Data Record” of said SIM because CDR only shows use of SIM in 
territorial/geographical jurisdiction of “Cell Phone Tower” 
installed by telecom operator and does not disclose that who is 
actually/exactly carrying and using said SIM; however, “Voice 
Record Transcript” or “End to End Audio Recording” can reflect 
the detail/identification of the user. Therefore, without “Voice 
Recording Transcript”, mere “Call Data Record” (CDR) alone of 
the SIM is inconclusive piece of evidence regarding identity of its 
user/carrier;” 
 
Hence, this piece of evidence is also of no avail.  
 
As far as pointing out place of feeding victim by the appellants without 
any recovery is of no avail similarly disclosing/pointing out place where 
deceased was thrown (which was already in the knowledge of the prosecution) 
is of no legal value.  
 
Recovery of red coloured motorcycle UNITED on the pointing out of 
Asif Ali (appellant) is also of no help to the prosecution as colour and 
registration number of motorcycle statedly used in the occurrence has neither 
been mentioned in the F.I.R. (Ex.CW-12/A) nor in the complaint (Ex.PB) 
which was filed after a considerable delay; whereas recovery of other articles 
i.e. CNIC, ATM, wallet, shoes, clothes are not enough to identify the accused, 
so same is also of no help to the case of prosecution.  
 
Motive was not mentioned in the F.I.R. though introduced subsequently 
in the complaint (Ex.PB) yet any witness could not be produced by the 
prosecution during trial of the case who disclosed the motive to the 
complainant; even any person who was witness of any relationship between 
deceased and Mst. Shumaila Bibi or of interest of Asif Ali with Shumaila Bibi 
or of annoyance of Asif Ali with deceased of the case for said reason, was not 
produced during trial, so motive has not been proved.  
8. 
Nutshell of the above discussion is that prosecution has been failed 
to prove its case against the appellants, therefore, there is no need to 
discuss defence version. 

Criminal Appeal No.1503/2023,  
Criminal Appeal No.1574/2023,

9. 
In view of what has been discussed above, Criminal Appeal 
No.1503/2023 filed by Asif Ali (appellant) and Criminal Appeal 
No.1574/2023 filed by Tauseef (appellant) are allowed; convictions 
recorded and sentences awarded to the appellants through impugned 
judgment dated: 24.12.2022 are hereby set-aside. Both appellants are 
acquitted of the charge, they be released from jail forthwith, if not required 
in any other case. 
10. 
Resultantly, death sentence awarded to Asif Ali (appellant) is NOT 
CONFIRMED and Murder Reference (M. R. No.42 of 2023) is answered in 
NEGATIVE. 
11.  
For the reasons recorded supra, Criminal Revision No.3600/2023 filed 
by Muhammad Waqar Adil (complainant/PW-1) for enhancement of sentence 
of Tauseef and compensation, stands dismissed.
