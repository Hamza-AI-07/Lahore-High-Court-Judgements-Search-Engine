Through this petition, the petitioner seeks post arrest bail in 
case FIR No.931 dated 15.09.2021 registered under Sections             
324,109,148,149 PPC read with Section 13(2a) Pakistan Arms 
Ordinance, 1965 amended 2015 at Police Station City Depalpur 
District Okara. 
2. 
During arguments, it was observed that place of occurrence 
in this case is the Court premises and injury has been caused with 
firing. Question arises as to whether jurisdiction of Anti-terrorism 
Court as per Third Schedule of Anti-terrorism Act, 1997 is 
attracted in the case though it is not the case of terrorism which 
seems a product of personal vendetta, therefore, until the question 
of jurisdiction is settled petition for bail cannot be decided. 
Therefore, on the last date of hearing notice was given to 
prosecution to assist the court on the question of law. In response, 
learned Additional Prosecutor General and Deputy Prosecutors 
General in unison submitted that pursuant to dictum laid down by 
Hon’ble Supreme Court in a case reported as “Ghulam Hussain 
and others versus the State and others” (PLD 2020 SC 61), all the 
heinous offences which are included in third schedule of Anti-

Crl. Misc. No.8329-B of 2023 
2 
terrorism Act, 1997 are to be tried by Anti-terrorism Court. On the 
other hand, learned counsel for the petitioner states that question 
of jurisdiction has already been settled that is the reason case was 
put for trial by prosecution before Court of ordinary jurisdiction.  
 
3.  
 Arguments heard; question dilated upon in the light of 
relevant law and judgment.  
 
4.   
To better appreciate the contentions, Third Schedule of 
Anti-terrorism Act, 1997 is reproduced as under for reference; 
 
                                              THE THIRD SCHEDULE  
                                                   (Scheduled Offences)  
                                                       [See section 2 (t)]  
 
(1) Any act of terrorism within the meaning of this Act including 
those offences which may be added or amended in accordance 
with the provisions of section 34 of this Act. 
  
(2) Any other offence punishable under this Act.  
 
(3) Any attempt to commit, or any aid or abetment of, or any 
conspiracy to commit, any of the aforesaid offences.] 
  
 
(4) Without prejudice to the generality of the above paragraphs, the 
Anti-terrorism Court to the exclusion of any other Court shall try the 
offences relating to the following, namely: –  
 
 
(i)  Abduction or kidnapping for ransom; 
 
(ii)  use of firearms or explosives by any device, including bomb 
blast in a mosque, imambargah, church, temple or any other 
place of worship, whether or not any hurt or damage is 
caused thereby; or 
 
(iii) firing or use of explosives by any device, including bomb 
blast in the Court premises; 
 
(iv) Hurt caused by corrosive substance or attempt to cause hurt 
by means of a corrosive substance; and 
 
(v)  Unlawful possession of an explosive substance or abetment 
for such an offence under the Explosive Substances Act, 
1908 (VI of 1908) 
                                                                      Emphasize supplied 
 
Entry-4 of above schedule clear indicates that offences mentioned 
thereunder are exclusively triable by the Anti-terrorism Court. 
Under said entry at serial No. iii, offence of firing in the Court 
premises is mentioned; therefore, despite the offence being result 
of personal vendetta where offence of terrorism is not attracted, 
shall be tried by the Anti-terrorism Court. The above observation 

Crl. Misc. No.8329-B of 2023 
3 
has also been attended in the light of judgment cited supra; for 
reference relevant excerpt is reproduced as under:- 
 
“A careful reading of the Third Schedule shows that an Anti-
terrorism Court has been conferred jurisdiction not only to try 
all those offences which attract the definition of terrorism 
provided by the Act but also some other specified cases 
involving heinous offences which do not fall in the said 
definition of terrorism. For such latter category of cases it 
was provided that although those offences may not constitute 
terrorism yet such offences may be tried by an Anti-terrorism 
Court for speedy trial of such heinous offences. This 
distinction between cases of terrorism and cases of specified 
heinous offences not amounting to terrorism but triable by an 
Anti-terrorism Court has already been recognized by this 
Court in the cases of Farooq Ahmed v. State and another 
(2020 SCMR 78), Amjad Ali and others v. The State (PLD 
2017 SC 661) and Muhammad Bilal v. The State and others 
(2019 SCMR 1362). It has been clarified by this Court in those 
cases that such specified heinous offences are only to be tried 
by an Anti-terrorism Court and that court can punish the 
person committing such specified heinous offences only for 
commission of those offences and not for committing terrorism 
because such offences do not constitute terrorism. For the 
purposes of further clarity on this issue it is explained for the 
benefit of all concerned that the cases of the offences specified 
in entry No. 4 of the Third Schedule to the Anti-terrorism Act, 
1997 are cases of those heinous offences which do not per se 
constitute the offence of terrorism but such cases are to be 
tried by an Anti-terrorism Court because of their inclusion in 
the Third Schedule. It is also clarified that in such cases of 
heinous offences mentioned in entry No. 4 of the said Schedule 
an Anti-terrorism Court can pass a punishment for the said 
offence and not for committing the offence of terrorism. It may 
be pertinent to mention here that the offence of abduction or 
kidnapping for ransom under section 365-A, P.P.C. is 
included in entry No. 4 of the Third Schedule and kidnapping 
for ransom is also one of the actions specified in section 7(e) 
of the Anti-terrorism Act, 1997. Abduction or kidnapping for 
ransom is a heinous offence but the scheme of the Anti-
terrorism Act, 1997 shows that an ordinary case of abduction 
or kidnapping for ransom under section 365-A, P.P.C. is 
merely triable by an Anti-terrorism Court but if kidnapping for 
ransom is committed with the design or purpose mentioned in 
clauses (b) or (c) of subsection (1) of section 6 of the Anti-
terrorism Act, 1997 then such offence amounts to terrorism 
attracting section 7(e) of that Act. In the former case the 
convicted person is to be convicted and sentenced only for the 
offence under section 365-A, P.P.C. whereas in the latter case 
the convicted person is to be convicted both for the offence 
under section 365-A, P.P.C. as well as for the offence under 
section 7(e) of the Anti-terrorism Act, 1997. The same may 
also be said about the other offences mentioned in entry No. 4 
of the Third Schedule to the Act pertaining to "Use of firearms 
or explosives by any device, including bomb blast in a mosque, 
imambargah, church, temple or any other place of worship, 
whether or not any hurt or damage is caused thereby", "Firing 
or use of explosive by any device, including bomb blast in the 

Crl. Misc. No.8329-B of 2023 
4 
court premises", "Hurt caused by corrosive substance or 
attempt to cause hurt by means of a corrosive substance" and 
"Unlawful possession of an explosive substance or abetment 
for such an offence under the Explosive Substances Act, 1908 
(VI of 1908)". Such distinction between cases of terrorism and 
other heinous offences by itself explains and recognizes that 
all heinous offences, howsoever serious, grave, brutal, 
gruesome, macabre or shocking, do not ipso facto constitute 
terrorism which is a species apart. Through an amendment of 
the Third Schedule any heinous offence not constituting 
terrorism may be added to the list of offences which may be 
tried by an Anti-terrorism Court and it was in this context that 
the Preamble to the Act had mentioned "Whereas it is 
expedient to provide for the prevention of terrorism, sectarian 
violence and for speedy trial of heinous offences". 
  
It clearly speaks that any offence of firing within the Court 
premises would only be tried by Anti-terrorism Court whereas 
challan of this case has been put before court of learned 
Magistrate who though did not have jurisdiction but commenced 
the trial and entertained the bail petition as well. Article 175(2) of 
The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
ordains as under:- 
 
“No court shall have any jurisdiction save as is or may be 
conferred on it by the Constitution or by or under any law.” 
 
 It was essential to put the challan of such case before the Anti-
terrorism Court but now it is pending in the court of magistrate. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that he would not press 
this petition provided case may be transferred to Anti-terrorism 
Court, so that he could move the bail petition before such Court.  
 
5. 
Transfer of case from a Court of ordinary jurisdiction to 
Anti-terrorism Court has also been argued before this Court and 
according to Additional Prosecutor General, under the law, 
ordinary Court does not possess power to send the case direct to               
Anti-terrorism Court. The only mechanism is that the challan of 
the case shall be returned to prosecution for its submission before 
the Anti-terrorism Court. Ms. Noshe Malik, the learned Deputy 
Prosecutor General in attendance states that challan should be 
withdrawn from the Court of ordinary jurisdiction by the High 

Crl. Misc. No.8329-B of 2023 
5 
Court and be entrusted to Anti-terrorism Court which is the right 
course. Arguments on this point were also heard.  
 
6. 
There are two situations when the case routs from court of 
ordinary jurisdiction to Anti-terrorism Court and both have 
different regimes. If the challan is put before any Court of 
ordinary jurisdiction and said Court on receiving challan considers 
that scheduled offence of Anti-terrorism Act is attracted from the 
facts of the case, it shall return the challan to prosecution for its 
presentation before Anti-terrorism Court because under section 
190 of Cr.P.C. It is the mandate of magistrate to take cognizance 
of only those offences which he is empowered to try or send to 
court of sessions for trial. This arrangement is also within the 
scheme of law because Anti-terrorism Court is authorized to take 
direct cognizance of the offence triable by such Court without the 
case being sent to it u/s 190 of Cr.P.C. as mentioned u/s 19(3) of 
Anti-terrorism Act, 1997, and such Court is authorized to decide 
the question of jurisdiction as per section 23 of Anti-terrorism 
Act, 1997. Reference may be made to cases reported as “Rao 
FAHD ALI KHAN Versus The STATE and another” (2014 P Cr. 
L J 1071 Islamabad), “MIR ALI Versus The STATE and 
another” (2020 P Cr. L J 1060 (Kar) “ALI AKBAR and another 
versus THE STATE” (PL D 1995 Karachi 10). 
 
7.    
 This above scheme of law also finds its place in section 
201 of Cr.P.C. a provision Pari Materia to Order VII Rule 10 of 
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (return of plaint) which requires 
that when any court if have no jurisdiction to entertain the private 
complaint it should return the same for its presentation to proper 
Court. For reference section 201 Cr.P.C. is reproduced as under:- 
 
“201. Procedure by Magistrate not competent to take 
cognizance of the case: (1) If the complaint has been made in 
writing to a Magistrate who is not competent to take cognizance 
of the case, he shall return the complaint for presentation to the 
proper Court with an endorsement to that effect.  
 
(2) If the complaint has not been made in writing, such Magistrate 
shall direct the complainant to the proper Court.” 

Crl. Misc. No.8329-B of 2023

What is to be looked in while deciding question of jurisdiction has 
been responded by a full Bench of this Court in a case reported as 
“AZHAR HUSSAIN and others Versus GOVERNMENT OF 
PUNJAB and others” (1992 P Cr. L J 2308), whereby case was 
recommended for transfer of case to Special Court while 
observing as under:- 
 
“The jurisdiction of the Court is to be determined on the 
basis of the allegations contained in F.I.R. and the case 
set up by the prosecution. The truthfulness or otherwise of 
the allegations can only be determined at the time of trial 
after recording evidence. Moreover, mere fact that the 
Kalashnikov had not been recovered can hardly justify the 
conclusion that it was not at all used.” 
 
This course has been approved by the Supreme Court in case 
reported as “ALLAH DIN and 18 others Versus THE STATE and 
another” (1994 SCMR 717), while citing above judgment of High 
Court which is reflected as under:-  
 
“5. For the purpose of deciding the question of jurisdiction, the 
Court has to rely upon the material which is in the possession 
of prosecution at the time of presentation of case. Both the 
Courts below have acted upon the proposition that 
jurisdiction is to be determined on allegations made in F.I.R. 
and the case set up by the prosecution. In support reliance is 
placed on the case of Azhar Hussain and others v. The 
Government of Punjab and others (1992 PCr. LJ 2308), 
which is full Court judgment of 3 Judges of Lahore High 
Court. In the reported case the point involved was identical 
inasmuch as it was alleged in F.I.R. that Kalashnikov was 
used but during investigation it was not recovered and on that 
ground along with allegation of mala fides trial by the Special 
Court was resisted. Contention was repelled and rightly so, on 
the ground that non-recovery of Kalashnikov could not justify 
conclusion that the same was not at all used and mala fides 
were not proved. 
 
6. We are in agreement with view expressed in the reported 
judgment mentioned above, and further observe that question 
of jurisdiction can be determined on the basis of F.I.R. and 
other material which is produced by the prosecution at the 
time of presentation of the challan. On the basis of that 
material the Court has to decide whether cognizance is to be 
taken or not. In the instant case incident is seen by six 
eye-witnesses and on our query whether eye witnesses have 
supported the allegation in F.I.R. about use of Kalashnikov 
like weapon, learned counsel for the petitioners replied in the 
affirmative. In the circumstances material available with 
prosecution in this case is sufficient to justify invocation of 
jurisdiction by the Special Court. Other contentions raised by 

Crl. Misc. No.8329-B of 2023 
7 
the learned counsel for the petitioners as mentioned above, 
can be properly appreciated only when evidence is recorded 
in the trial Court and witnesses are cross-examined. When 
that stage comes, the law will take its own course and it is 
open to the parties to take steps as are permitted by the law. 
For the present we are of the view that no flaw or legal 
infirmity is pointed out in the judgment of the High Court 
warranting interference. Leave is refused and the petition 
being devoid of merits, is hereby dismissed.” 
 
 
Thus, while examining the material, if the Court determines as 
lacking of jurisdiction, it can return the challan to prosecution for 
presentation before the proper Court.  
 
8. 
  However, when the case is pending trial and a question of 
jurisdiction arises then of course challan cannot be returned to the 
prosecution because by the time certain court processes are on the 
record including the evidence that become part of judicial record 
which cannot be handed over to the prosecution nor can be kept in 
isolation in court record while detaching the challan only because 
evidence recorded by one Court can be acted upon by the 
Successor Court. In such situation the right course would be 
sending the challan directly by the Court of ordinary jurisdiction 
to the Anti-terrorism Court. Section 12 (1) of Anti-terrorism Act, 
1997 states that:-  
 
“(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code or 
in any other law, a scheduled offence committed in an 
area in a Province or the Islamabad Capital Territory 
shall be triable only by the Anti-terrorism Court 
exercising territorial jurisdiction in relation to such 
area.” 
 
In order to respect above mandate of law, it is incumbent upon 
every other Court to send the case for trial before Anti-terrorism 
Court.  
 
9. 
   Cases are of two categories, i.e., where offence of 
terrorism in terms of section 6 of Anti-terrorism Act, 1997 is 
committed and other which become triable by its inclusion in the 
third schedule of the Act ibid. Though for assessing the 
applicability of section 6 Anti-terrorism Act, 1997, some brain 

Crl. Misc. No.8329-B of 2023 
8 
storming is required keeping in view the material placed before 
the Court but for offence under Entry-4 of Third Schedule, the 
case can on first go be sent to the Anti-terrorism Court. If any case 
is pending trial before a Court of ordinary jurisdiction or any other 
Special Court for an offence and by virtue of an amendment such 
offence is included in the third schedule of Anti-terrorism Act, 
1997 the case shall immediately be sent by the Court of ordinary 
jurisdiction to the Anti-terrorism Court as held by Division Bench 
of this Court in case reported as “Rana ABDUL GHAFFAR Versus 
ABDUL SHAKOOR and 3 others” (P L D 2006 Lahore 64). 
 
“A change of forum of trial by operation of law is ordinarily 
applicable to all pending cases and retrospectivity or 
otherwise of application of such law is not a relevant 
consideration in that regard. A reference in this respect may 
be made by us to the cases Liaqat Parvez Khan v. 
Government of the Punjab through Horne Secretary and           
2 others PLD 1992 Lah. 517. (FB) and Muhammad Mushtaq 
v. Muhammad Ashiq and others PLD 2002 SC 841.” 
 
 
10.     The cases are usually pending trial before the Court of 
Magistrate, Court of Sessions or before any other Special Court; 
what course should be adopted for sending the case to Anti-
terrorism court is tracked in some provisions of law and 
precedents. If the case is pending before the Court of Sessions or 
any Special Court which usually enjoys the status as that of Court 
of Sessions under the relevant law. The Anti-terrorism Court is 
also considered as Court of Sessions under Anti-terrorism Act, 
1997 for the purpose of trial and it has also power to take 
cognizance under Section 190 of Cr.P.C. as a Magistrate, 
therefore, on the information or an application can call for the 
record of any case pending in another Court in order to ascertain 
the commission of any offence under Anti-terrorism Act, 1997. A 
case reported as “Rana ABDUL GHAFFAR Versus ABDUL 
SHAKOOR and 3 others” (P L D 2006 Lahore 64) is referred in 
this respect. In the cited case on an application when Anti-
terrorism Court declined to call for record of case from the Court 
of Sessions, the Hon’ble Division Bench of this Court has 

Crl. Misc. No.8329-B of 2023 
9 
deprecated such practice and allowed the case to be transferred to 
the Anti-terrorism Court. On the same analogy when any Court of 
ordinary jurisdiction suspects commission of an offence under 
Anti-terrorism Act, 1997, it can send the case directly to the Anti-
terrorism Court and Court on determination of its jurisdiction shall 
proceed with the case from the stage at which it was pending 
immediately before such transfer and it shall not be bound to 
recall and re-hear any witness who has given evidence and may 
act on the evidence already recorded because section 350 of 
Cr.P.C. has been made applicable for trial by Anti-terrorism 
Courts by virtue of section 32 of Anti-terrorism Act, 1997, which 
is reproduced as under:- 
“32. Overriding effect of Act. (1) The provisions of this 
Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything contained in 
the Code or any other law, but save as expressly provided in 
this Act, the provisions of the Code shall, in so far as they 
are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, apply to 
the proceedings before an Anti-terrorism Court; and for the 
purpose of the said provisions of the Code, an Anti-
terrorism Court shall be deemed to be a Court of Sessions. 
 
(2) 
In particular and without prejudice to the generality 
of the provisions contained in sub-section (1), the 
provisions of section 350 of the Code shall, as far as may 
be, apply to the proceedings before an Anti-terrorism Court, 
and for this purpose and reference in those provisions to a 
Magistrate shall be construed as a reference to an Anti-
terrorism Court.”  
 
This view is supported by a case decided by Division Bench of 
Peshawar High Court reported as “MIR ZAMAN Versus ZUBAIR 
and another” (2003 P Cr. L J 1086). In this case 11 prosecution 
witnesses have been recorded when the case was sought for 
transfer and Court formulated following questions:-  
 
“16. Questions that would require determination would be:-- 
 
(a) Whether Sessions Judge/Special Judge, Nowshera could 
have sent the case to ATC? 
 
(b) If so, should the ATC to start de novo with the trial or to 
start with the proceedings from the stage it was received by 
him? 
 
(c) Whether the ATC could convict the appellants without 
framing any charge of an offence under the Act?” 
 

Crl. Misc. No.8329-B of 2023 
10 
The Court after answering such questions in paragraphs 17, 18 
and 19 of the above judgment, has held that case has rightly been 
sent to Anti-terrorism Court by Special Court STA, therefore, 
after framing Charge u/s 6/7 of Anti-terrorism Act, 1997 Anti-
terrorism Court can proceed with the trial; what has finally been 
concluded by the Court is reflected below:- 
 
“20. Under section 32(2) of the Act the provisions of 
section 350, Cr.P.C. have been made applicable before 
ATC. 
 
As through independent sections of the Act i.e. sections 
12(3), 13(4) and 28 of the Act protection is given to 
evidence already recorded by a Court of equal jurisdiction 
and the ATC would start with the trial from the stage it is 
sent, therefore, insertion of section 350, Cr.P.C. in section 
32 of the Act would be an additional power for proceeding 
on the basis of evidence already recorded by another 
Court. 
 
21. Section 350(1) of Cr.P.C. is followed by a proviso 
where it provides that if conviction is recorded by a 
Sessions Judge then the High Court is of the opinion that 
accused has been materially prejudiced may order a new 
inquiry or trial. 
 
22. While concluding, we hold that initially the Court of 
STA has taken cognizance and was within its competence. 
Having realized that the action committed in the offences 
constitutes act of terrorism it was rightly sent to ATC and 
ATC has rightly proceeded with the case on the basis of 
evidence already recorded but it was incumbent upon the 
ATC to have reframed the charge under section 6 read with 
section 7. of the Act so to make offence triable by itself.” 
 
Similarly in a case reported as “FIDA HUSSAIN Versus 
ADDITIONAL 
SESSIONS 
JUDGE, 
JAMPUR, 
DISTRICT 
RAJANPUR and another” (2006 P Cr. L J 1551), this court has 
declared the act of Additional sessions Judge as legal when he sent 
the case to Anti-terrorism Court for trial of an offence mentioned 
under entry-4 of third schedule of Anti-terrorism Act, 1997.  
 
11.  
    There is a consensus on the point of law that on the eve 
of transfer of case from Court of ordinary jurisdiction or any 
Special Court to Anti-terrorism Court, it still has power to decide 
its jurisdiction in terms of section 23 of the Act ibid and can 
transfer it back to the Court having jurisdiction.  
 

Crl. Misc. No.8329-B of 2023 
11 
12.         Now turning to the situation, if the case is pending 
before the Court of a Magistrate, as in the present case, then a 
slight shift in the procedure is the requirement of law. Magistrates 
though assume jurisdiction on a report submitted u/s 173 Cr.P.C. 
however, they are subordinate to the Session Judge and work is 
distributed among them as per section 17 of the said Code, 
therefore, though they are authorized to return the challan before 
the cognizance is taken as explained above, yet they cannot send 
the case directly to the Anti-terrorism Court when the case has 
crossed the stage of cognizance. Section 346 of Cr. P.C. explains 
somewhat like procedure as under:-  
 
“346. Procedure of Magistrate in cases, which he cannot 
dispose of: (1) If, in the course of an inquiry or trial 
before a Magistrate in any district, the evidence appears 
to him to warrant a presumption that the ease is one which 
should be tried or sent for trial to the Court of Session or 
the High Court, by some other Magistrate in such district, 
he shall stay proceedings and submit the case, with a brief 
report explaining its nature, to the Sessions Judge or to 
such other Magistrate, having jurisdiction, as the Sessions 
Judge, directs.  
 
(2) The Magistrate to whom the case is submitted may, if 
so empowered, either try the case himself, or send the case 
for trial to the Court of Session or the High Court.” 
 
This section clearly mandates to raise hands if the Magistrate 
lacks jurisdiction or is not empowered to try the case due to some 
other reasons, or decides that case should or ought to be tried by 
Court of Sessions, he can send the case to the Court of Sessions. 
Cases reported as “MUHAMMAD HANIF Versus THE CROWN” 
(PLD 1956 Lahore 394); “GHULAM HUSSAIN and others 
Versus THE STATE” (1985 P Cr. L J 2334), are referred. Section 
347 Cr.P.C. is also a support to above legal provision. Though by 
virtue of section 32 of Anti-terrorism Act, 1997, an Anti-terrorism 
Court is deemed to be a Court of Sessions but as the case is 
entrusted to the Magistrate by the Sessions Judge u/s 17 of Cr.P.C. 
and is also empowered to withdraw a case from the Court of 
Magistrate u/s 528 of Cr.P.C, therefore, Magistrate shall stay the 
proceedings and submit case, with a brief report explaining its 

Crl. Misc. No.8329-B of 2023 
12 
nature, to the Sessions Judge for onward transmission to the Anti-
terrorism Court for its opinion. An Anti-terrorism court for this 
purpose is deemed as Magistrate authorized u/s 190 which gives 
powers to take cognizance of an offence on police report, private 
complaint and upon his own information. For cognizance upon his 
own information a judgment of Division Bench of this Court is 
cited passed in case reported as “Y.K. LEE Versus DIG 
SARGODHA and 4 others” (2007 Y L R 1554); therefore, on 
taking cognizance by the Anti-terrorism Court, it can decide the 
jurisdiction either to assume it u/s 19(3) of Anti-terrorism Act, 
1997 or take action u/s 23 for transfer of case back to Court of 
ordinary jurisdiction and thereafter concerned Court of Magistrate 
can recommence the trial from the stage it was stayed u/s 346            
Cr. P.C.   
 
13.     Attending to submissions made by Ms. Noshe Malik, 
Learned Deputy Prosecutor General, a course for transfer of case 
u/s 526 Cr.P.C. is also available, if the case is being tried by a 
Magistrate or Court of Sessions. High Court u/s 526 (3) Cr. P.C. is 
empowered to transfer the case from Court of ordinary jurisdiction 
to Anti-terrorism Court, and this would be done in following 
manner as mentioned in above section:- 
 
“(3) The High Court may act either on the report of the 
Lower Court, or on the application of a party interested, 
or on its own initiative.” 
  
 
The authority of High court particularly for transfer of case from 
Court of ordinary jurisdiction to Anti-terrorism Court has been 
acknowledged in case reported as “MUHAMMAD AKBAR KHAN 
and 3 others Versus SHO P.S. GARHI KHAIRO, DISTRICT 
JACOBABAD and others” (2017 P Cr. LJ  1280) (SINDH). Under 
Section 526 Cr. P.C. High Court can transfer the case inter se 
subordinate courts only, therefore, question arises whether Anti-
terrorism Court is also subordinate to High Court. This has been 
settled in case reported as “MUHAMMAD JAWAD HAMID Versus 

Crl. Misc. No.8329-B of 2023 
13 
Mian MUHAMMAD NAWAZ SHARIF and others” (PLD 2018 
Lahore 836), by a full Bench of this Court whereby Anti-
terrorism Court has been declared as inferior/ subordinate court to 
the High Court. 
14.         Considering the facts of case, the offence was committed 
as a result of firing in court premises, therefore, being scheduled 
offence under entry-4 of third schedule of Anti-terrorism Act, 
1997, it is essential that case should be tried by Anti-terrorism 
Court 
concerned; 
therefore, 
while 
exercising 
revisional 
jurisdiction read with section 526 (3) of Cr.P.C., the case 
registered through FIR No.931/21 dated 15.09.2021 u/s 324, 109, 
148, 149 PPC; u/s 13(2a) Pakistan Arms Ordinance, 1965, 
amended 2015  P/S City Depalpur, District Okara is withdrawn 
from the Court of Magistrate Section 30, Depalpur and is 
transferred for trial before the Anti-terrorism Court, Sahiwal in 
accordance with law. On assuming jurisdiction Anti-terrorism 
Court, Sahiwal shall proceed with the case from the stage at which 
it 
was 
pending 
immediately 
before 
such 
transfer. 
Accused/petitioner can move bail petition before the Anti-
terrorism Court which shall be decided on its own merits. This 
petition is disposed of in the above terms.
