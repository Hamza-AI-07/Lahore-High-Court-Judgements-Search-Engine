                  06.03.2024.        Mr. Kamil Hussain Naqvi, Advocate for the petitioner. 
                                             Syed Farhad Ali Shah, Prosecutor General Punjab.  
                                             Mr. Imran Abbas Sahi, AAG with Javed DSP.  
                  Mr. Ikram Ullah Niazi & Miss Maida Sobia, Deputy   
Prosecutors General. 
 
         This petition was filed under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 for the 
recovery of Zaheer-ul-Hassan, brother of the petitioner 
allegedly from illegal confinement of Imran Yousaf Inspector & 
Adnan Mushtaq ASI serving at Organized Crime Unit Civil 
Line Division Lahore (respondents No.4 & 5), with consequent 
relief of legal action against the said respondents.  
 
2. 
In response to notice, report on behalf of respondent No.2 
(Capital City Police Officer, Lahore) speaks that detenu 
required in number of cases was arrested in case FIR 
No.1641/2023 under section 392 PPC Police Station Old 
Anarkali District Lahore on 04.01.2024, being nominated 
through supplementary statement of the complainant, and while 
remaining on physical remand with police has been lodged to 
judicial custody on 08.01.2024.  
 
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner regarded the report 
deficient due to deliberate concealment of actual facts. 
According to him, earlier learned Magistrate through order 
dated 29.12.2023 while declining physical remand, directed the 
lodging of detenu to judicial custody in FIR bearing 
No.3738/2023 Police Station Ghaziabad, District Lahore for his 
later appearance on 12.01.2024, but police did not lodge him to 
judicial custody in such FIR, which fact was denied by the 
respondents and claimed that after lodging him to judicial 

 
W.P. No.1075 of 2024

custody, his physical custody was again obtained by the order 
of Magistrate in case FIR No.1641/2023 under section 392 PPC 
Police Station Old Anarkali District Lahore. Upon which 
learned counsel for the petitioner raised a question that “once 
an accused is lodged to judicial custody, his further physical 
remand in that case or some other FIR(s) cannot be granted 
except a permission for investigation within the jail premises”. 
Embarking upon such request while attending to section 167 & 
344 of Cr.P.C, it was observed that though there exist no 
provision which could authorize the police to obtain physical 
remand of an accused in another FIR if he had been lodged to 
judicial custody in a case yet there is also no specific 
prohibition too. Thus, for seeking legal assistance learned 
Prosecutor General, Punjab and learned Assistant Advocate 
General were directed to assist the Court on this point.  
 
4. 
In compliance with order dated 18.01.2024, the learned 
Prosecutor General, Punjab submitted his report and took the 
stance that “practice of police to arrest the accused at their 
wish and whims in different cases in one after the other for the 
purpose of investigation separately amounts to denial of 
fundamental rights and liberty”. He placed reliance on 
following cases reported as “GHULAM SARWAR Versus THE 
STATE” (1984 P Cr. L J 2588); “RAZIA PERVAIZ Versus THE 
STATE” (1992 P Cr. L J 131) “SHAH NAWAZ AND 
RANJHOO versus THE STATE” [NLR 1996 Cr. L.J 116 
(Sukkur)], “DIL MUHAMMAD versus THE DISTRICT 
MAGISTRATE, QUETTA and 3 others” [1997 P Cr. L J 1203 
(Quetta)] and “PARVEZ ELAHI versus CARE TAKER 
GOVERNMENT OF PUNJAB, etc.” (PLJ 2024 Lahore 43).  
 
5. 
Learned Assistant Advocate General, on the other hand, 
while referring the cases cited in report of learned Prosecutor 
General, Punjab as “SHAH NAWAZ AND RANJHOO versus 
THE STATE” [NLR 1996 Cr.LJ 116 (Sukkur)], “DIL 
MUHAMMAD 
versus 
THE 
DISTRICT 
MAGISTRATE, 
QUETTA and 3 others” [1997 P.Cr.LJ 1203 (Quetta)],

PUNJAB, etc” (PLJ 2024 Lahore 43), in addition case reported 
as “ADEEL and another versus The STATE” [2016 YLR 2212 
(Peshawar Abbottabad Bench)] supported the view of learned 
Prosecutor General, Punjab but submits that in appropriate 
cases physical remand can be granted in different FIRs. Learned 
Deputy Prosecutors General were also heard at length who 
reiterated the stance of learned Prosecutor General but stated 
that a mechanism must be in place to regulate the physical 
custody of accused for investigation in different FIRs. Upon 
which for further assistance, research wing of this Court was 
assigned the duty to collect the relevant case laws. Mr. 
Muhammad

efficiently collected following case laws, aptly applicable on 
the legal query involved in this case;

another” (PLD 2014 Balochistan 33), “MUHAMMAD

MAGISTRATE QUETTA etc” (PLJ 1997 Quetta 137 (DB),

Secretary, Peshawar and others (Writ Petition  No. 5281-
P/2023 With CM No, 2615-P/2023)   
 
6.    Out of above Judgments, some speak that though there 
exist no provision in Cr.P.C. which could authorize subsequent 
physical remand in the same case once accused is lodged to 
judicial custody but concerned Magistrate can grant physical 
remand of such accused in different FIRs if there exist 
exceptional and convincing circumstances. The logic behind 
such decision is being highlighted while referring relevant case 
laws. A division Bench Judgment reported as “ADEEL and 
another Versus The STATE” (2016 Y L R 2212 Peshawar 
(Abbotabad Bench), concludes as under; 
  

 
W.P. No.1075 of 2024 
 
4 
 
“39. It is settled law that once an accused is sent to Judicial lockup 
he cannot be handed over to Police subsequently and successive 
remand cannot be given except in extra ordinary circumstances. If 
remand is required in exceptional cases then it must be on the basis 
of detail given in the application for remand and the reasons given 
by the Magistrate concerned.” 
 
Another Division Bench Judgment reported as “MAHMUD ALI 
KASURI, BAR-AT-LAW versus PUNJAB GOVERNMENT THROUGH 
SECRETARY, HOME AFFAIRS AND 3 OTHERS” (P L D 1977 
Lahore 1400), commands as under; 
 
“In addition to the provisions which would ordinarily safeguard the 
interest of a free person against arrest and detention, in the above 
visualized situation, the police would face further obstacle in a case 
where the accused is already in detention in Jail under Court orders. 
Firstly, the fresh arrest and police custody would, in some manner, 
encroach upon the judicial custody; and, secondly, it would disturb 
the prison arrangements which must already be in force in 
pursuance of the writ of the Court or its warrant/order. The fresh 
arrest thus cannot be effected by the police unless a specific Court 
order is obtained in this behalf. Not only this, an order permitting 
fresh arrest simpliciter would not authorise the police to take the 
accused out of judicial custody and bring him under police custody 
without a proper remand order of the Court, even if it is for only 
twenty-four hours. The Jail Authorities under the law would not be 
competent to hand over the custody of the accused to the police 
without the orders of the Court for any period of time whatsoever.”  
 
In the same Judgment, the discretion of police to arrest or not to 
arrest was focused upon in following words; 
 
“It may be clarified here that the police is not bound under the law 
to resort to the power to arrest under section 54, Cr. P. C., in every 
case where they are permitted to do so. They have the discretion 
either not to arrest or to arrest under or without warrant. The 
discretion is wide. There is no compulsion that it must always be 
exercised in one manner, namely, of effecting physical arrest 
without warrant. Therefore, in most of the cases, it would not be 
necessary for the police to go through the ritual of formally 
arresting a person who is already in detention in jail as an undertrial 
prisoner in other case.”  
 
The final form of guidelines to grant successive remand, 
formulated in the judgment, is reflected as under; 
 
“As a corollary, it would follow that it would not be necessary for 
the Court to permit such, an arrest in every case. The facts and 
circumstances of the case necessitating such action by the police 
would have to be kept in mind consistent with the principle that in 
case of detention for trial of an offence (subject to the facts and 
circumstances of the case and/or the legal provisions relating to 
bail) detention in police custody is only an exception to the normal 
course of judicial custody, if at all the prisoner cannot be allowed to 
remain at liberty;” 
  
Another 
Division 
Bench 
Judgment 
reported 
as 
“DIL 
MUHAMMAD versus DISTRICT MAGISTRATE QUETTA etc.” 

 
W.P. No.1075 of 2024 
 
5 
 
(PLJ 1997 Quetta 137 (DB) throws light on the subject that 
successive remand can be obtained in different FIRs with the 
permission of concerned Magistrate; it is as follows; 
 
“7. In the light of above mentioned discussion it can be inferred 
that once a person is sent to judicial custody, his custody cannot be 
handed over to Police subsequently and successive remand cannot 
be given in different cases, but if the cases are registered at different 
places or different Police Stations remand can be given after 
completion of necessary formalities which are mandatory in nature 
and should not be ignored and it must be kept in view that where a 
accused person is in custody it is necessary that trial Court should 
be kept aware regarding his remand and prior approval whereof 
would be necessary. There is no bar in the Provisions as 
contained in Section 167 and 344 Cr. P.O. that custody of an 
accused person cannot be handed over to Police if he is required for 
the purpose of investigation in a case different from one in which he 
had already sent to judicial custody.” 
 
On the basis of similar provisions of Cr.P.C., a Division Bench 
Judgment of RAJASTHAN HIGH COURT from Indian 
Jurisdiction is also available in support of successive remands 
which was reported as “State Versus Sukhsingh and others” 
[1954 AIR (Raj) 290: 1955 RLW 46: 1954 CriLJ 79: 1955 
RLW 46: 1954(4) ILR (Rajasthan) 413]. It questions that 
whether where an accused is kept in jail by orders of 
adjournment or remand under Section 344 of Cr.P.C, can he be 
handed over to the police in some other case for purposes of 
investigation. In view of the powers of the Magistrate under 
Section 167(2), the Court saw no prohibition in the Criminal 
Procedure Code against such a course. Thus, the logic was 
discussed like as under; 
“Supposing a person is accused of one offence, and investigation of 
that case is complete and the challan has been submitted to Court, he 
will, in these circumstances, be sent to jail or to judicial custody to 
await his trial. Supposing later evidence is discovered of his 
complicity in another case, and the police in order to complete the 
investigation of that case requires to question the accused, or the 
handing over of the accused to police custody would aid the 
investigation In some way; in such a case we fail to understand why 
it may not be open to a Magistrate under Section 167(2) to take the 
accused out of jail or judicial custody and hand him over to the 
police for the maximum period of 15 days provided in that Section. 
Of course, before the Magistrate does so, he will have to satisfy 
himself that a good case is made out for detaining the accused in 
police custody in connection with the investigation of the other 
case.” 
 

 
W.P. No.1075 of 2024

The above judgment was also followed in our jurisdiction in 
case reported as “GHULAM RUBBANI AND 3 OTHERS versus 
THE STATE AND ANOTHER” (PLD 1971 Lahore 741). 
 
7.    As per facts of a case reported as “STATE versus FATEH 
MOHAMMAD” (1972 S C M R 182), in response to a warrant 
of arrest issued by the Magistrate, the offender directly 
surrendered before him who lodged the accused to judicial 
custody; later police sought physical remand of accused which 
was granted. Such order of Magistrate was overturned by the 
High Court but Supreme Court of Pakistan held as under;  
“The statutory right of the police to investigate a cognizable offence 
cannot be circumvented by the accused by avoiding the Police and 
surrendering before a Magistrate. It is true that having surrendered 
before the Magistrate and put himself in the custody of the Court 
the Police could not secure custody of the person without an order 
of the Magistrate concerned. And this is exactly how the police 
secured the custody of the respondent in the present case: It is for 
the Magistrate in such circumstances to consider whether the 
accused should continue to remain in the custody of the Court or be 
delivered over to the Police for the purpose of completing the 
investigation. In the present case the learned Magistrate in the 
exercise of the discretion allowed to him under the law made over 
the custody of the respondent to the Police for a limited time and for 
a particular purpose. Thus, the Magistrate was legally competent to 
do. The learned Single Judge of the High Court, therefore, was not 
right in interfering with the order of the Magistrate without having 
first held that the Magistrate had not exercised his discretion in a 
judicial manner.” 
  
8.  On information about presence of accused in judicial 
custody in a case in another district or province, Police can 
follow the procedure laid down in Rule 26.20 of Police Rules, 
1934 for subsequent remand; it is reproduced as under; 
 
26.20. Transfer of arrested persons. - (1) If a police officer 
lawfully arrests a person, without warrant, in a district in which the 
investigation, enquiry and trial cannot be held, and the offence is 
non-bailable or such person cannot give bail, he shall take or send 
such person before the District Magistrate or Ist Class Magistrate 
having jurisdiction over the area and obtain an order for the transfer 
of the prisoner to the district in which the offence was committed.  
 
(2) No accused or convicted person shall be taken in custody from 
one district to another or from one province to another, except 
under the written order or warrant of the magistrate or other lawful 
authority directing such transfer. 
 
9.   Even as per Rule-6 (1) (b) of Part-B, Chapter-11 of High 
Court Rules & Orders, Volume-III, Magistrate can remand the 
accused to Police custody (if empowered to do so) or to 

 
W.P. No.1075 of 2024 
 
7 
 
magisterial custody as he may think fit, for a term not 
exceeding 15 days, which term if less than 15 days, may 
subsequently be extended up to the limit of 15 days in all, but it 
does not mean that if before exhausting 15 days’ physical 
remand  accused is lodged to judicial custody, police can retake 
his physical custody in the same case to claim remaining period 
out of 15 days. In Rule-10 of same Chapter of High Court Rules 
& Orders as cited above, it is mentioned that if the limit of 15 
days has elapsed, and there is still need for further investigation 
by the Police, the procedure to be adopted is laid down in 
section 344, Criminal Procedure Code. The case is brought on 
to the Magistrate's file and the accused, if detention is 
necessary, will remain in magisterial custody. The case may be 
postponed or adjourned from time to time for periods of not 
more than 15 days each, and as each adjournment expires the 
accused must be produced before the Magistrate, and the order 
of adjournment must show good reasons for making the order. 
Same procedure is highlighted in APPENDIX No. 25.56(1) of Police 
Rules, 1934. 
 
10.  In the celebrated judgment of this Court reported as “Mst. 
Razia Pervaiz and another versus The Senior Superintendent of 
Police, Multan and 5 others” (1992 P Cr. L J 131), it was 
declared that an accused required in more than one criminal 
cases when arrested will be deemed to have been arrested in all 
the cases registered against him, and warned that law does not 
authorize the police to arrest an accused required in more than 
one cases, in one case and to wait for his arrest in the other case 
till the expiry of the period of remand under Section 167, 
Cr.P.C. or till he is released on bail in the first case, and this 
Court, therefore, held in a case reported as “PARVEZ ELAHI 
versus CARE TAKER GOVERNMENT OF PUNJAB etc.” (PLJ 
2024 Lahore 43) as under; 
“It is held that if it spurs out from the record that arrest in different 
cases is not being sought for the purpose of investigation but to 
keep the accused in physical custody of law enforcement agency for 
a longer period in order to kneel down him to their terms, then it is 
not only illegal but an offence, and bona fide of police for arrest in 

 
W.P. No.1075 of 2024 
 
8 
 
different cases is reflected if they put remand request with criminal 
record of accused.” 
 
In Indian jurisdiction, ANDHRA PRADESH HIGH COURT 
while dealing with a case reported as “M/s. Jagathi 
Publications Ltd., rep., by Y. Eshwara Prasad Reddy Versus 
Central Bureau of Investigation, Hyderabad” [2012(2) ALT 
(Crl.) 285 : 2013 CriLJ 118 : 2013(2) CCR 98 : 2014(10) 
R.C.R.(Criminal) 84 : 2012(2) Andh LD (Criminal) 762] 
directed the authorities that  “All political parties should have 
equal opportunities to participate in election campaigns and 
propaganda and no one should be unnecessarily arrested and 
harassed, except, wherein, his arrest is bona fidely required for 
the purpose of investigation”, and declared for that situation as 
reflected below; 
 
“(3) It is also made clear that wherein a case the accused involved in 
several distinct offences which are within the knowledge of 
investigating agency, his arrest must be shown in all such distinct 
offences, i.e., he is deemed to have been arrested in all such cases.” 
 
Similarly, in our jurisdiction Peshawar High Court while 
dealing with a situation of political turmoil has also held 
recently in a case titled as Asad Qaisar versus Government of 
Khyber Pakhtunkhaw, thorough Chief Secretary, Peshawar and 
others (Writ Petition No. 5281-P/2023 With CM No, 2615-
P/2023) that; 
 
“In other words, a person once arrested is deemed to be arrested in 
all cases registered against him prior to his arrest. Arrest of an 
accused persons involved in so many criminal cases of the same 
province after his release on bail in another case amounts to colorful 
exercise of powers which cannot be countenanced at any cost.” 
 
 
11.   On the strength of above judgments and legal provisions, it 
can safely be held that when an accused is arrested in a case, his 
arrest must be shown in all cases registered against him so far 
within the knowledge of investigating agency; however, if he 
has been lodged to judicial custody in a case, his subsequent 
physical remand can be obtained by the police in other FIRs 
registered at different police stations or districts or province 
with the permission of concerned Magistrate/Court.  
 

 
W.P. No.1075 of 2024

12.   Coming back to case in hand, it is, therefore declared that 
if the accused was in a judicial custody in another case, granting 
of further physical remand by the Magistrate in case FIR 
No.1641/2023 under section 392 PPC Police Station Old 
Anarkali District Lahore was not illegal, but in order to further 
ascertain the contention of learned counsel for the petitioner 
that detenu was not lodged to judicial custody pursuant to order 
of Magistrate dated 29.12.2023 in case FIR No.3738/2023 
under sections 392/411 PPC Police Station Ghaziabad District 
Lahore, a report from superintendent District Jail, Lahore was 
requisitioned which was received to the effect that detenu was 
not lodged in the jail pursuant to order of Magistrate dated 
29.12.2023 in FIR No.3738/2023 cited supra. Thus, this Court 
by virtue of order dated 20.02.2024 directed Capital City Police 
Officer, Lahore to conduct an inquiry in the matter, register a 
criminal case against delinquent police officers/officials and 
submit report to this Court.  
 
13. 
Today report has been received. Capital City Police 
Officer, Lahore after conducting inquiry has found the 
delinquent police officials as responsible for committing 
criminal breach of duty and in compliance whereof an FIR 
bearing No.681/2024 under Article 155 (1)(c) of the Police 
Order, 2002 at Police Station Ghaziabad District Lahore stood 
registered. Learned counsel for the petitioner states that now 
after granting bail to the detenu by concerned Court he has been 
set at liberty. As Police has also conceded the commission of 
criminal act by respondents No.4 & 5, therefore, this writ 
petition now stands disposed of.
