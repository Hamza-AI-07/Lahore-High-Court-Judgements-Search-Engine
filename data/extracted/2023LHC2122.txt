appellant alongwith Mr. Muhammad Karim

Through this Election Appeal under Section 63 of 
the Elections Act, 2017 (Act), the appellant has 
challenged the order dated 22.03.2023 (impugned 
order), whereby his nomination papers were rejected by 
the Returning Officer (respondent) on the ground that 
his seconder did not appear at the time of scrutiny of his 
nomination papers. 
2. 
Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the 
appellant alongwith his proposer appeared before the 
respondent, however, his seconder could not appear 
because of death of his real uncle. Submits that the 
seconder promised to appear after offering funeral prayer 
but the respondent without waiting for his seconder 
rejected his nomination papers, even though no objection 
was filed by any person. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the respondent, on the other 
hand, submit that presence of the seconder was required 
to verify his signature under Section 62(9)(d) of the Act, 

 
Election Appeal No.24513/2023                                                                          -2- 
 
 
 
hence, his presence was mandatory at the time of 
scrutiny. 
4. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. The provision 
of Section 62(2) of the Act, being relevant to the 
controversy, is reproduced hereunder:- 
“62(2) The candidates, their election 
agents, the proposers and seconders and 
one other person authorized in this behalf 
by each candidate, and a voter who has 
filed an objection under sub-section (1), 
may attend the scrutiny of nomination 
papers, and the Returning Officer shall 
give them reasonable opportunity for 
examining all the nomination papers 
delivered to him under section 60.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
The plain reading of sub-section (2) of Section 62 of the 
Act shows that the candidates, their election agents, the 
proposers and seconders and one other person authorized 
in this behalf by the candidate, and a voter who has filed 
an objection may attend the scrutiny of nomination 
papers. The word “may”, used in Section 62(2) of the 
Act, depicts that it is not mandatory for the proposer and 
seconder to appear before the Returning Officer at the 
time of scrutiny and therefore, without any objection 
from any person merely due to absence of the seconder at 
the time of scrutiny, the nomination papers of the 
appellant could not be rejected.  
5. 
Similar provision was available under Sub-section 
(1) of Section 14 of the erstwhile Representation of the 
People Act, 1976 (ROPA). The learned Sindh High 
Court in “ALI MUHAMMAD Vs. IQBAL KHAWAJA” 
(2008 CLC 843), while interpreting the said provision, 
held that due to word “may” the presence of the proposer 

 
Election Appeal No.24513/2023                                                                          -3- 
 
 
 
and seconder at the time of scrutiny is not mandatory. 
Same view was also expressed while interpreting similar 
provision in local Government laws by this Court and the 
learned Balochistan High Court in “GUL MUHAMMAD 
Vs. PROVINCE OF PUNJAB through District Officer 
(Revenue)” (2006 YLR 1963) & “ABDUL KARIM Vs. 
THE RETURNING OFFICER/AC, HUB AT HUB and 
another” (PLD 1999 Quetta 78). 
6. 
No doubt, under Section 62(9) of the Act the 
Returning Officer may, on either of his own motion or 
upon an objection, conduct a summary enquiry and may 
reject the nomination papers, if he is satisfied with the 
grounds mentioned therein including that the signature of 
the proposer or seconder is not genuine. This provision 
cannot be construed that presence of proposer or 
seconder is mandatory but it means that where presence 
of proposer or seconder was specifically required by the 
Returning Officer to verify the genuineness of their 
signature or for any other purpose relating to the scrutiny 
of nomination papers then their absence could be fatal 
and nomination papers could be rejected. However, mere 
absence of the proposer or seconder cannot be a sole 
ground to reject the nomination papers. In the present 
case, neither any objection was filed by any third party 
(voter) nor any inquiry was required to be conducted by 
the respondent to examine the genuineness of the 
signature of proposer or seconder. Further, the seconder 
(Mr. Muhammad Karim), for whose absence the 
nomination papers were rejected, is present in the Court 
and has endorsed the fact that he was the seconder of the 
appellant and also his signature, marked on the 
nomination forms, are genuine. 

 
Election Appeal No.24513/2023                                                                          -4- 
 
 
 
7. 
In view of the above discussion, this Election 
Appeal is allowed and the impugned order dated 
22.03.2023 is set-aside. Consequently, the Returning 
Officer is directed to include the name of the appellant in 
the list of eligible candidates.
