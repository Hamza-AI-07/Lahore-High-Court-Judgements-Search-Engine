General. 
 
 
Unnecessary details apart, on 19.07.2022, the 
petitioner filed complaint before the Provincial 
Ombudsman, Punjab, Lahore (respondent No.4), 
inter-alia with the allegations that land of graveyard 
and two ponds was illegally allotted by the revenue 
authorities to the private persons. After summoning 
of 
reports 
from 
the 
concerned 
departments, 
respondent No.4, vide decision, dated 06.09.2022, 
directed the Additional Deputy Commissioner 
(Revenue), Narowal, to restore original position of 
Khasra No.1599 according to its status prior to the 
years 1984-85. Aggrieved of the decision of 
respondent No.4, respondents No.1 to 3 filed 
representation before the Governor, Punjab, Lahore 
(respondent No.5) in terms of section 32 of the

Punjab Office of the Ombudsman Act, 1997 (the Act, 
1997) which was allowed vide order, dated 
03.01.2024 and decision of respondent No.4 was 
reversed. Aggrieved of order, dated 03.01.2024, 
passed by respondent No.5, the petitioner has filed 
this petition. 
 
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits 
that while upsetting the findings of respondent No.4, 
respondent No.5 failed to appreciate that the land of 
graveyard and ponds could not be allotted to private 
persons under the garb of consolidation proceedings; 
that according to section 37 of the Act, 1997 said 
enactment has overriding effect over other laws, thus, 
no illegality was committed by respondent No.4 
while issuing certain direction through his decision 
which was reversed by respondent No.5 in a casual 
manner; that respondent No.4 has the jurisdiction to 
deal with any allegation of mal-administration, thus, 
no illegality was committed by him while issuing 
direction to the revenue authorities for restoration of 
original entries; that as per section 2(1) of the Act,

office of a provincial government or a statutory 
corporation, thus, respondent No.4 was competent 
enough to issue direction to the revenue authorities  
and that bona-fide nature of claim of the petitioner is 
evinced from the fact that pursuant to the decision, 
rendered by respondent No.4, revenue authorities 
have already taken up cognizance of grievance of the 
petitioner relating to allotment of land of ponds. 
3. 
Learned Additional Advocate General, while 
opposing the submissions made by learned counsel 
for the petitioner, submits that according to own 
showing of the petitioner, the land of the graveyard 
and ponds was allotted to the private persons as a 
result of consolidation proceedings, thus, no other 
forum, except the consolidation authorities, have 
jurisdiction to look into any illegality and that 
according to section 13 of the Punjab Consolidation 
of Holdings Ordinance, 1960 (the Ordinance, 1960), 
Board of Revenue can call for and examine any 
record 
relating 
to 
consolidation 
proceedings 
irrespective of period of limitation and the petitioner

proceedings. 
4. 
In exercise of his right of rebuttal, learned 
counsel for the petitioner submits that since 
grievance of the petitioner was in relation to 
maladministration on the part of the revenue/ 
consolidation authorities, same was amenable to the 
jurisdiction of respondent No.4. 
5. 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties at 
considerable length and have also gone through the 
documents, annexed with this petition. 
6. 
It is admitted position that the land, subject 
matter of the complaint filed by the petitioner, was 
allotted in favour of private persons as a result of 
consolidation proceedings conducted in the year 
1984-85. According to section 11(1) of the 
Ordinance, 1960, an aggrieved person can challenge 
order of a Consolidation Officer confirming the 
scheme within sixty days before the Collector and 
under sub-section 2 of the said provision, a second 
appeal lies before the Commissioner. Further, section

Order with signature of Judge, and that of

13 of the Ordinance, 1960, empowers Board of 
Revenue to call for and examine record of 
proceedings conducted under the Ordinance, 1960 at 
any time suo moto or on the application of an 
aggrieved person but the petitioner did not bother to 
avail any of the above remedies. Though, learned 
counsel for the petitioner tried to wriggle out of the 
said dilemma by stating that the petitioner was not 
aware about the consolidation proceedings but it 
cannot be believed that a person, who is residing in 
the same village, was not aware about consolidation 
proceedings as they were not only conducted openly 
but also took considerable time. 
7. 
While responding to Court’s query that as to 
how respondent No.4 had jurisdiction to deal with 
any issue relating to consolidation proceedings, 
learned counsel for the petitioner has referred to 
section 37 of the Act, 1997 to establish that as the 
said Act has over-riding effect, the jurisdiction of 
respondent No.4 was fully attracted notwithstanding 
the decisions of the consolidation authorities. The 
over-riding effect is to the extent of any other law for

Order with signature of Judge, and that of

the time being in force and it does not cover the 
orders passed by the authorities concerned, under the 
relevant law. Had the petitioner approached the 
consolidation authorities before confirmation of 
consolidation proceedings, the referred provision 
could come to his rescue but when the consolidation 
scheme was confirmed by the relevant authorities he 
was supposed to challenge the same in appropriate 
proceedings under the provisions of the Ordinance, 
1960 and challenge to said proceedings under the 
garb of section 9 of the Act, 1997 was a 
misconception. 
8. 
During the course of arguments, learned 
counsel for the petitioner repeatedly argued that since 
the land reserved for public welfare was allotted to 
private persons, during consolidation proceedings, 
the said proceedings could not be considered as 
sacrosanct. The grievance of the petitioner might 
have been genuine but question before this Court is 
as to jurisdiction of respondent No.4 to decide the 
fate of consolidation proceedings, confirmed way 
back in the year 1984-85. At the cost of repetition, it

is observed that when more than one remedies have 
been provided against confirmation of consolidation 
proceedings, without availing the said remedies, the 
petitioner could not approach respondent No.4.     
9. 
While responding to Court’s query as to why 
the petitioner is shy to approach the authorities 
established under the Ordinance, 1960, for redressal 
of his grievance, learned counsel for the petitioner 
states that since more than four decades have already 
passed, if any move is made by the petitioner, it 
would go abortive on the point of limitation. In this 
regard, I do not see eye-to-eye with learned counsel 
for the petitioner for the reason that section 13 of the 
Ordinance, 1960 deals with powers of the Board of 
Revenue to call for and examine record relating to 
consolidation proceedings and if any omission or 
commission is noted, same can be cured. The said 
provision, for facility of reference is reproduced 
herein below: - 
“13.    Power to call for and examine 
records.–  
   
(1) The Board of Revenue may– 
(a)  at any time of its own 
motion call for the record of

(b)  on application made to it in 
that 
behalf 
by 
a 
person 
aggrieved within ninety days of 
the passing of an order in any 
proceedings 
under 
this 
Ordinance by any Revenue or 
Consolidation, 
Officer, 
and 
after giving such person an 
opportunity of being heard call 
for 
the 
record 
of 
such 
proceedings. 
 
(2)  A Commissioner or Collector, 
may call for the record of any case 
under this Ordinance pending before, 
or disposed of by any Revenue officer 
or Consolidation Officer under his 
control. 
 
(3)  If in any case in which a 
Collector has called for the record 
under sub-section (2), he is of opinion 
that the proceedings taken or order 
made should be modified or reversed, 
he shall report the case with his 
opinion thereon for the orders of the 
Commissioner. 
 
(4)  The Board of Revenue may in any 
case called for under sub-section (1) 
and a Commissioner may in any case 
called for by him under sub-section 
(3) passed (sic) such order as it or he 
thinks fit:

of a subordinate Revenue Officer and 
affecting 
any 
question

right 
between 
private 
persons 
without 
giving those persons an opportunity of 
being heard.” 
 
According to the afore-quoted provision, Board of 
Revenue has been empowered to call for record of 
any consolidation proceedings of its own or on the 
move of a party, irrespective of any limitation, thus, 
the apprehension of the petitioner that if he 
approaches the consolidation authorities, under the 
provisions of the Ordinance, 1960, he would be 
knocked out on the basis of limitation, is 
misconceived. 
10. 
During the course of arguments, learned 
counsel for the petitioner put much emphasis on the 
fact that since revenue authorities fall within the 
definition of agency as defined under section 2(i) of 
the Act, 1997, no illegality was committed by 
respondent No.4 while rendering the decision which 
was set aside by respondent No.5 in routine. In this 
regard, I am of the view that there is no cavil with the 
fact that revenue/consolidation authorities fall within

the definition of agency but question before this 
Court is as to whether respondent No.4 could 
interfere with order passed by Consolidation Officer, 
confirming consolidation proceedings three decades 
ago.  
11. 
Now coming to plea of learned counsel for the 
petitioner that since the matter was referred to the 
revenue authorities in view of the consent of the 
Additional 
Deputy 
Commissioner 
(Revenue), 
Narowal, respondent No.5 could not reverse the 
findings of respondent No.4, I am of the view that 
when a forum has not been blessed with jurisdiction 
to hear a matter, same cannot be bestowed even with 
the consent of opponent side. Reliance in this regard 
can be placed on the case reported as Karachi Dock 
Labour, Labour Board v. Messrs Quality Builders 
Ltd. (PLD 2016 SC 121). 
12. 
For what has been noted above, I see no 
reason to differ with the conclusion arrived at by 
respondent No.5 while accepting the representation 
filed by respondents No.1 to 3. Consequently, this 
petition is dismissed with the observation that the
