MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.:- Through instant 
revision petition, petitioners have challenged judgment dated 
01.03.2018, passed by learned Additional District Judge, Ahmadpur 
East, whereby appeal filed by respondent against Trial Court’s order 
dated 20.12.2016 dismissing his application for extension of time 
period to deposit the remaining sale consideration, was allowed.  
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that respondent filed suit for specific 
performance of contract, which was contested by petitioners by filing 
written statement. Learned Trial Court, after framing issues, recording 
evidence and hearing arguments of both sides, proceeded to decree the 
suit vide judgment & decree dated 06.12.2016. Upon respondent’s 
failure to deposit the aforesaid amount, he filed application for 
extension of time to deposit balance consideration whereas petitioners 
filed application for rescission of contract. Learned Trial Court vide 
order dated 20.12.2016 dismissed respondent’s application for 
extension of time to deposit the balance amount and allowed 
petitioners’ application for rescission of contract, thereby dismissing 
respondent’s suit. Feeling discontent, respondent filed appeal, which 

 
2 
C.R. No.388 of 2018/BWP  
was allowed by learned Appellate Court vide judgment dated 
01.03.2018. Hence, instant revision petition.  
3. 
Learned counsel for petitioners while referring to the 
observations of learned Trial Court submits that the judgment & decree 
in favour of respondent was not alive as per law as stipulation qua 
payment of remaining consideration amount within 10 days stood 
unfulfilled. He adds that Trial Court had become functus officio, thus, 
was incompetent to extend the time for deposit of remaining sale 
consideration, however, impugned judgment has been passed while 
ignoring this legal position. In support, he has referred to Muhammad 
Wahid and another v. Nasrullah and another (2016 SCMR 179) and 
Haji Abdul Latif and 4 others v. Ateeq Ahmad and 3 others (2004 YLR 
985). 
4. 
Contrarily, learned counsel for respondent defends the impugned 
judgment by contending that Appellate Court has rightly exercised the 
jurisdiction in terms of Section 104 CPC and correctly enhanced time 
for deposit of remaining sale consideration. He adds that extension of 
time is not an alteration or modification of a decree to be hit by Order 
XX Rule 3 CPC. In support, he has referred to Shabbir Ahmed and 
another v. Zahoor Bibi and others (PLD 2004 Supreme Court 790), 
Ata Ullah Khan and others v. Mst. Surraya Parveen (2006 SCMR 
1637), Nizam-ud-Din and 13 others v. Ch. Muhammad Saeed and 7 
others (1987 CLC 1682), Nasir Ahmad v. Muhammad Yousuf (PLD 
1994 Lahore 280) and Mirza Zafar Iqbal Baig and 2 others v. Mirza 
Ayub Baig and 3 others (2010 YLR 386).  
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused. 
6. 
Undisputedly, respondent’s suit for specific performance of 
contract was conditionally decreed vide judgment & decree dated 
06.12.2016, whereby respondent had been given 10-days’ time to 
deposit balance consideration amount, otherwise he would be deemed 
to be non-suited.  The relevant part of said judgment is reproduced 
hereunder:- 
“20. 
In view of my opined rendered in issues supra, the plaintiff’s 
suit is decreed on merits along with possession of suit land as 
prayed for subject to payment of remaining consideration amount of 

 
3 
C.R. No.388 of 2018/BWP  
Rs.10,000/- within 10 days of this judgment, failing which the plaintiff 
will deemed to be non suited. Parties are left to bear their own costs. 
…..”  
 
7. 
The sole question before this Court is whether the Civil Court 
had become functus officio or still having seisin over the decree was 
legally competent to pass an order to extend time for deposit of 
remaining consideration amount by the respondent. Moreover, the 
nature of decree would also to be considered as the preliminary or final 
and what should be the just and fair order to have been passed by a 
Court in this regard.  
8. 
Section 148 of the Civil Procedure Code gives the Court power 
to extend time previously fixed or granted by it for the doing of any act 
prescribed or allowed by the Code of Civil Procedure and it can do so 
even after the period originally fixed or granted has expired. But this 
section, it is now well settled, does not apply where the period is fixed 
by a decree in a suit unless the decree is in the nature of a preliminary 
decree. The principle upon which it has been so held is that since a 
decree normally puts an end to a suit, the Court becomes functus officio 
with regard thereto. In the case of a preliminary decree, the Court does 
not become functus officio but still retains control over the action and, 
therefore, has full power to make necessary orders therein including an 
order for the extension of time. This distinction is not without 
importance, for, even orders contained in decrees, which are not 
strictly speaking preliminary decrees, may not always be such as are 
intended to operate automatically without any further intervention by 
the Court. The real test, is whether the decree has been made in such 
terms as to indicate that the Court has finally disposed of all matters so 
that it is to operate automatically or whether the Court has still retained 
some control over the litigation. An examination, therefore, has to be 
made of the precise terms used in the decree. In the present case, the 
decree of the Trial Court used the words that in the event of default, 
“plaintiff will deemed to be non-suited”. Since the words used in Trial 
Court’s judgment are words of finality and are to take effect 
automatically, Section 148 CPC can have no manner of application and 

 
4 
C.R. No.388 of 2018/BWP  
the time cannot be enlarged. Reliance is placed upon Shah Wali v. 
Ghulam Din alias Gaman and another (PLD 1966 Supreme Court 
983), Shujat Ali v. Muhammad Riasat and others (PLD 2006 Supreme 
Court 140), Tasneem Ismail and others v. Messrs WAFI Associates 
and others (2007 SCMR 1464) and Mst. Samrana Nawaz and others v. 
M.C.B. Bank Ltd. and others (PLD 2021 Supreme Court 581).  
 
The aforesaid question after discussing the earlier judgments 
rendered by superior Courts in pros and cons on the proposition in 
hand has already been authoritatively clinched by this Court in 
Muhammad Ismail v. Muhammad Akbar Bhatti (PLD 1997 Lahore 
177), relevant part whereof is reproduced hereunder:- 
“The ratio, deducible from the preceding examination, is: Firstly, that 
decree passed by court, in an action for specific performance of 
agreement of sale, is in the nature of preliminary decree. It actually 
partakes the character of a contract; vendee has to deposit the 
purchase price, cost for purchase of necessary stamps for the 
execution of conveyance deed and so on so forth; while the seller 
had to appear in the Court, sign the conveyance deed and receive 
purchase price. In this state of affairs, it clearly follows that decree, 
passed in such an action, is not final but preliminary in nature and 
the court passing the decree retain seisin over the lis and has power 
to enlarge/extend the time for payment of purchase price fixed 
therein. The court, however, had to pass such orders after 
objectively assessing the merits of such applications. Secondly, 
Specific Relief Act is an adjective law and substantive law is to be 
looked for elsewhere. It presents a codification of principles derived 
from long series of precedents and practices of English Courts of 
Equity. Specific Relief Act so is based upon principle of Equity, 
reason and good conscience. The most leading principle is that 'who 
comes to get the equity, must do equity to others'. Thirdly section 35 
of the Specific Relief Act lays down a procedure for rescission of the 
written contract. It applies to both vendor and vendee. Any one of 
such party may move the Court by motion in the action for an order 
for putting an end to contract. This mechanism is, however, subject 
to following limitation/namely where the trial court has decreed the 
suit for specific performance of contract subject to condition that 
purchase price shall be deposited in court within a specific time and 
also ordered that if that money is not put in within that time, the suit 
shall stand dismissed, the court has no power to extend the time as 
in such a case; that the decree by court is final and self-operative 
and in case of default of payment of purchase price; the mandate of 
court tantamounts to rescission of the contract. In such a case 
recourse to section 148 of C.P.C. or section 151, C.P.C. will not be 
permissible. Fourthly, the court will not allow the plea for extension 
of time if it finds that it will occasion a wrong to the other side. 
Furthermore, in order to succeed in an action for specific 
performance, the plaintiff had to show that he had been willing and 
ready to perform his part of contract.”

C.R. No.388 of 2018/BWP  
This view has also been followed by this Court in cases reported as 
Muhammad Iqbal through Legal Heirs v. Bashir Ahmad and 19 others 
(PLD 2002 Lahore 88) and Mst. Ruqiya Bibi and 10 others v. Allah 
Ditta and 17 others (2018 YLR 2118).  
9. 
The legal position emerging from aforesaid case law is that on 
account of the penal clause contained in Trial Court’s decree, upon 
respondent’s failure to deposit the remaining sale consideration 
within time fixed therein, respondent stands non-suited and 
consequently, the subject matter agreement to sell automatically 
stood rescinded in terms of section 35(c) of the Specific Relief Act, 
1877. The jurisdiction with the learned Trial Court was only 
available within the stipulated period in the subject matter decree 
and the moment this stipulated period expired, it ceased to have 
jurisdiction and had become functus officio, in view of the 
expression of adjudication through a condition contained in the 
decree.  
10. 
Resultantly, instant revision petition is allowed and impugned 
judgment dated 01.03.2018, passed by learned Additional District 
Judge, Ahmadpur East is set aside. Consequently, Trial Court’s order 
dated 20.12.2016 is restored.
