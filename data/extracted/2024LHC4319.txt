till the date of realization from the defendant? OPP 
2. Whether the plaintiff is liable to pay

3. Relief.”

under Order 14 Rule 5 read with Section 151 CPC for 
striking out issue No.2. The said application was accepted by 
the trial court vide order dated 19.11.2018 and issue No.2

RFA No.12839/2024 
 
said order, the appellant filed revision petition which was 
dismissed on 02.09.2020. 
4. 
On 01.02.2020 appellant/defendant also filed a suit for 
recovery of Rs.61,35,326/- against the respondent/plaintiff in 
which the respondent/plaintiff filed contesting written 
statement and filed an application on 22.03.2021 under 
Section 151 CPC for consolidation of both suits. On the 
application of the respondent/plaintiff both suits were 
consolidated and on 06.11.2021 consolidated issues were 
framed as under:- 
“1. Whether the plaintiff (M/s Sefam Ltd) is 
entitled for recovery of outstanding amount 
Rs.65,279,750/- with interest till the date of

second payment and an amount of Rs.2,444,000/- 
as delay payment penalty, from the plaintiff as

Relief?” 
 
On the very date of framing of issues (06.11.2021) the 
learned counsel of the respondent/ plaintiff made statement 
that he relied upon the evidence already available on record 
and the trial court adjourned the case for evidence of the 
appellant/defendant for 20.11.2021. The trial court after 
recording the evidence of the appellant /defendant dismissed 
the suit of the appellant and partially decreed the suit of the 
respondent/plaintiff 
vide 
judgment 
& 
decree 
dated 
29.11.2022 by granting following reliefs; 
“33. In view of discussion on issues supra first

34. Suit of Defendant Company/suit at serial No.2 
for 
recovery 
of 
Rs.61,35,326/- 
is 
hereby 
dismissed……” 
 
Being dissatisfied with above determinations, the appellant 
filed the instant appeals on the ground that no opportunity 
was granted to the appellant to cross examine the statement 
of the witnesses of the respondent/plaintiff which cause 

RFA No.8394/2023 
6 
RFA No.12839/2024 
 
infringement of fundamental right of the appellant as well as 
offend the provisions of order XVIII  CPC.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
6. 
Admittedly, 
on 
the 
application 
of 
the 
respondent/plaintiff both suits were consolidated and issues 
were framed on 06.11.2021 and on the same date, the learned 
counsel of the respondent/plaintiff got recorded his statement 
whereby he relied upon the evidence already recorded before 
consolidation of suit titled as M/s Sefam Pvt. Ltd Vs Saasa 
Corporation of the respondent/plaintiff but the trial court did 
not require the appellant to cross examine the statements of 
the witnesses of the respondent/plaintiff and straightway 
fixed the case for evidence of the appellant/defendant 
whereas after framing fresh consolidated issues it is 
mandatory under Order XVIII of CPC for the trial court to 
fix the case for cross examination upon the witnesses of the 
respondent/plaintiff/PWs but no fair opportunity was granted 
which is blatant violation of aforesaid provision of law, as 
such the said order dated 06.11.2021 to the extent of non-
granting opportunity to the appellant/defendant to cross 
examine the witnesses of the respondent/plaintiff derives no 
support of law.  
7. 
Initially, there was no direct provision available in 
Code of Civil Procedure for the consolidation of the suits and 
to circumvent the multiplicity of litigation as well as to avoid 

RFA No.8394/2023 
7 
RFA No.12839/2024 
 
passing of the conflicting judgment/ decree, the Courts 
ordinarily resorts to its inherit jurisdiction under Section 151 
C.P.C to consolidate the suits, proceedings, petitions on the 
basis of similarities of parties, subject matter of suits as well 
as dispute between the parties and it would be in the fitness 
of things to resolve the controversy between the parties, 
avoid passing of conflicting decisions as well as multiplicity 
of litigation and said objects could only be achieved by 
consolidating the suits. Reliance is placed on a judgment 
titled as Muhammad Yaqoob Vs. Behran Khan (2006 SCMR 
1262) wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has 
observed as under: 
 “3…. It is settled principle of law that where a common 
subject of claim is in dispute in counter-suits, both the 
suits are consolidated and decided together. This rule is 
imperative in order to avoid conflicting decisions. The 
rule was completely ignored by the trial Court as it failed 
to decide the issue in question and committed error to 
stay the proceeding of time respondent’s suit which was 
rightly rectified by the learned High Court with cogent 
reasons in the impugned judgment. It is pertinent to 
mention here that parties in both the suits are the same 
and subject-matter/ property is the same. It is well-settled 
by a long chain of authorities that the consolidation of the 
suits can be ordered by the Court in exercise of its 
inherent powers. The consent of the parties is not the 
condition precedent for exercise of such powers. The 
purpose of the consolidation is to avoid multiplicity of 
litigation to eliminate award of contradictory judgments 
and to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court. 
These purposes are merely illustrative and not exhaustive 
of the powers of the Court. There may be other variety of 
grounds that in the interest of justice the Court may 
persuaded to consolidate the cases.” 
Another reliance is placed on a case titled as Zahid Zaman 
Khan and others Vs. Khan Afsar and others (PLD 2016 SC 
409) the relevant portion whereof is reproduced as under: 

RFA No.8394/2023 
8 
RFA No.12839/2024 
 
 “7…. It is settled law that it is the inherent power of the 
Court to consolidate suits and the purpose behind it is to 
avoid multiplicity of litigation and to prevent abuse of 
process of law and court and to avoid conflicting 
judgments. No hard and fast rule forming the basis of 
consolidation can be definitive and it depends upon the 
facts and the points of law involved in each and every 
case, obviously where the court is persuaded that the 
interests of justice so demand, consolidation can be 
ordered, provided no prejudice is caused to any litigant 
and there is no bar in the way of the courts to consolidate 
the suits.” 
8. 
The power of consolidation of two or more suits is 
normally derived by the lower courts from principles laid 
down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in cases 
titled as Muhammad Ijaz and another Vs. Muhammad Shafi 
through L.Rs. (2016 SCMR 834) and Abdul Qudoos Vs. 
Commandant Frontier Constabulary, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 
Peshawar and another (2023 SCMR 334). 
9. 
Further, to cater the obstacle in the way of 
consolidation of suits/ proceedings an amendment was 
introduced in Order II Rule 6-A C.P.C whereby a modus 
operandi was provided in respect of consolidation of two or 
more suits. The said provision is reproduced as under: 
 “6-A. Consolidation of suits.—Where two or more suits or 
proceedings of the same nature requiring determination of 
similar issues between the same parties are pending in relation 
to the same subject matter, the Court may, if considers it 
expedient for avoiding multiplicity of litigation or conflict in 
judgments, direct the consolidation of such suits or proceedings 
as one trial, whereupon all such suits or proceedings shall be 
decided on the basis of the consolidated trial.” 
After consolidation of the suits it is legal requirement to 
record evidence in the light of Order XVIII C.P.C. The 
ingredients of a valid statement of a witness are enunciated in 

RFA No.8394/2023 
9 
RFA No.12839/2024 
 
Articles 132, 133 & 134 of Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 
which consists of almost three constituent:- 
i) 
Examination in chief. 
ii) 
Cross examination and  
iii) 
Re-examination 
As the complete statement of a witness entail examination in 
chief, cross examination and re-examination and if a witness 
enter in the witness box, it is legally desirable that his 
statement in complete be recorded in one session and 
fragmentary recording of the statement should be avoided 
subject to certain legal and well-reasoned exceptions. In this 
regard Rule 3 of Chapter I, Volume I of the Rules and Orders 
of the Lahore High Court, Lahore prescribes the procedure for 
recording examination-in-chief of a witness and Rule 4 
thereof categorically prescribes that when the examination in 
chief is concluded, the opposite side should be allowed to 
cross examine the witness. For ready reference, Rules 3 and 
4 ibid are reproduced as under: 
 “3. Examination-in-Chief.—In the examination of witnesses 
questions ought not to be put in a leading form, nor in such a 
form as to induce a witness, other than an expert, to state a 
conclusion of his reasoning, an impression of fact, or a matter 
of belief. The question should be directed to elicit from him 
facts which he actually saw, heard or perceived within the 
meaning of Article 71 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 (X of 
1984). The questions should be simple, should be put one by 
one and should be framed so as to elicit from the witness, as 
nearly as may be in chronological order, all the material facts 
to which he can speak of his own personal knowledge. A 
general request to a witness to tell what he knows, or to state 
the facts of the case should, as a rule, not be allowed because 
it gives an opening for a prepared story. Where the party 
calling witnesses is not abided by Counsel, and is unable 
himself to propyl examine his witnesses he may be asked to 
suggest questions and the examination may be conducted by 
the Court. 

RFA No.8394/2023 
10 
RFA No.12839/2024 
 
4. Cross-examination.—When the examination-in-chief is 
concluded the opposite side should be allowed to cross-
examine the witness, or, if unable to do so, to suggest 
questions to be put by the Court. In cross-examination leading 
questions are permissible.” 
Further, the right to given evidence and the right to cross-
examine the witness strictly in terms of Order XVIII C.P.C 
read with the relevant provisions of Qanun-e-Shahadat 
Order, 1984 unmistakenably is part of substantial law. 
Reliance in this regard is placed on a judgment titled as 
Muhammad Asghar Vs. Hussain Ahmad and others (PLD 
2014 SC 89). 
10. 
Moreover, it is settled principle of law that no one 
should be condemned unheard and if any adverse order is 
passed without affording an opportunity of hearing to the 
opponent party, such order is termed as illegal and passed in 
violation of the principle of “due process of law” as 
enshrined in Article 10-A of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973. Reliance in this regard is placed 
on the dicta rendered by the Supreme Court of Pakistan cited 
as Mrs. Shagufta Shaheen & Others Vs The State through 
D.G. NAB, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa & Another (2019 SCMR 
1106) and Justice Qazi Faez Isa and others Vs. President of 
Pakistan and others (PLD 2022 SC 119).  Moreover, non-
providing opportunity to cross examine the witnesses is 
violative of the principles of fair trial as settled by this Court 
in a case titled as Adnan Anwar & Another Vs Muhammad 
Sharaiz Hussain & Another (PLD 2019 Lahore 68).       

RFA No.8394/2023 
11 
RFA No.12839/2024 
 
11.  
As far as argument of the learned counsel for the 
respondent/plaintiff that in the first suit before consolidation 
the right for cross examination upon the witnesses of the 
respondent/plaintiff was closed and in this regard, Revision 
Petition of the appellant was also dismissed, as such order 
was rightly passed, suffice it to say that after consolidation 
both suits and framing of fresh issues, the learned counsel of 
the respondent/plaintiff made a statement regarding taking 
reliance upon the evidence already recorded before the 
consolidation, thus it was imperative for the trial Court to 
afford fair opportunity to the learned counsel of the 
appellant/defendant to cross examine the witnesses of the 
respondent/plaintiff in the light of principles prescribed by 
Order XVIII CPC read with Rules 3 & 4 of Chapter I, 
Volume I of the Rules and Orders of the Lahore High Court, 
Lahore, but the said procedure was deviated which offend the 
process of law as well as the principle of fair trial and 
pronouncements of the Hon’ble Superior Courts, whereas it 
was mode of law that the case ought to have been fixed for 
cross examination but no such opportunity of cross 
examining the witnesses was granted, hence, the act of the 
court cause prejudiced to the fundamental right of the 
appellant whereas it is settled principle that act of court 
should not cause prejudice to the right of any party. Reliance 
is placed on the cases cited as Muhammad Ijaz & Another Vs 

RFA No.8394/2023 
12 
RFA No.12839/2024 
 
Muhammad Shafi through LRs (2016 SCMR 834) & Abdul 
Qudoos Vs Commandant Frontier Constabulary, Khyber 
Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar & Another (2023 SCMR 334).  
12. 
In view of above, these appeals are allowed. Judgment 
& decree dated 29.11.2022 passed by the learned Civil 
Judge, Lahore is set aside and matters are remanded to the 
trial court who shall afford two fair opportunities to the 
appellant/defendant to cross examine the witnesses of the 
respondent/plaintiff whereafter the trial court shall decide 
both the suits on merits afresh. Parties are directed to appear 
on 28.10.2024 before the learned District Judge, Lahore who 
shall entrust the case to the court of competent jurisdiction 
for adjudication. The said court shall give two fair 
opportunities 
to 
the 
appellant/defendant 
for 
cross 
examination upon the witnesses of the respondent and 
whereafter shall decide the fate of the suits on merits 
expeditiously preferably within a period of four months 
positively.
