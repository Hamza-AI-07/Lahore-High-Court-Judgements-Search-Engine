Ch. Muhammad Iqbal, J:-  Through this civil revision 
the petitioners have challenged the validity of the judgment & 
decree dated 08.10.2021 passed by the learned Civil Judge, 
Lahore who dismissed the suit for declaration and cancellation of 
documents, possession through partition with permanent 
injunction filed by the petitioners and also assailed the judgment 
& decree dated 02.12.2022 passed by the learned Additional 
District Judge, Lahore who dismissed the appeal of the 
petitioners.  
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that Mehwish Mughal, 
petitioners and one Mirza Ijaz Baig filed a suit for declaration and 
cancellation of documents, possession through partition with 
permanent injunction against the respondents/defendants with the 
assertions that the plaintiffs are the successors of Mst. Jamila 
Begum wife of Mirza Muhammad Hussain who was owner of 
land measuring 13 Kanal 02 Marla situated in Moza Mota Singh 
Wala, District Lahore. Mst. Jamila Begum passed away leaving 
Date of hearing

behind one son Fazal Hussain Baig, the maternal grandfather of 
the plaintiffs No.1 & 2 and two daughters namely Bashir Begum 
and Rasheeda Begum. Fazal Hussain passed away leaving behind 
one son Mirza Pervaiz Ahmad Baig (father of respondents No.5 
& 6) and one daughter namely, Shafaqat Parveen (mother of 
present petitioners/ plaintiffs). The plaintiffs are the legal heirs of 
Mst. Shafqat Parveen who married to Mirza Ijaz Ahmad Baig, 
deceased (who was plaintiff No.3 in the plaint). Mst. Shafqat 
Parveen died on 02.10.1977. After her death, Mirza Parvez 
Ahmad Baig did not incorporate the names of the petitioners as 
legal heirs of Mirza Fazal Hussain in inheritance mutation 
No.649 dated 19.01.2000. They also got attested further 
inheritance mutation No.786 dated 24.04.2003. On the basis of 
aforesaid illegal mutations, the defendants No.5 & 6 got attested 
registered sale deed dated 02.07.2003 in favour of defendant 
No.4, who further sold the said property to defendant No.3 
through registered sale deed. The petitioners/plaintiffs also 
challenged the validity of two registered gift deed as well as the 
subsequent mutations. The petitioners/ plaintiffs stated that they 
are legal heirs of Mst. Shafqat Parveen who was daughter of 
Mirza Fazal Hussain Baig as such they are entitled to get their 
share in the estate left by Mirza Fazal Hussain Baig. The 
petitioners/plaintiffs prayed for cancellation of the aforesaid 
mutations.  
 
The respondents No.2&3/defendants No.2 & 3 while 
filing the contested written statement contended that Mst. Jamila 
Baig died on 12.12.1982 whereas inheritance mutation No.649 
was incorporated on 19.01.2000. Mst. Shafqat Parveen was not 
daughter of Mirza Fazal Hussain rather her father’s name was 
Mirza Afzal Hussain Baig as per her Nikah Nama as such the 
petitioners/plaintiffs are not entitled for any share in the 
inheritance Mirza Fazal Hussain Baig. The other respondents/

defendants abandoned the trial proceeding so they were 
proceeded against ex-parte. Out of the divergent pleadings of the 
parties, the trial Court framed issues, recorded pro and contra 
evidence of the parties and finally dismissed the suit vide 
judgment & decree dated 08.10.2021. Being dejected, only the 
petitioner No.1/Mst. Mehwish Mughal filed an appeal whereas 
Mirza Imran Baig/plaintiff No.2 was living abroad as such he was 
arrayed as respondent. The appeal was dismissed by the appellate 
Court vide judgment & decree dated 02.12.2022. Hence, this civil 
revision.  
3. 
I have heard learned counsels for the parties and have 
gone through the record. 
4. 
The core controversy involved in this case is centered 
upon Issues No.1, 2 & 5 which are reproduced as under: 
 “1. Whether the plaintiffs are co-owners in the impugned 
property on the basis of their status as legal heirs of their 
deceased predecessor but the defendants have deprived them 
through forged and fictitious sale deeds in their favour which 
are ineffective qua the rights of the plaintiffs and liable to be 
canceled? OPP 
2. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled for declaratory decree 
alongwith 
cancellation 
of 
impugned 
documents 
and 
consequential relief of possession of the property as prayed 
for? OPP 
5. Whether the plaintiffs are not legal heirs of late Fazal 
Hussain because Mst. Shafqat Parveen was not the daughter of 
Late Mirza Afzal Hussain. Therefore, they are stopped by their 
act and conduct to file the instant suit and the suit is liable to 
be dismissed? OPD” 
Mst. Mehwish Mughal (P.W.1) has deposed that her great 
maternal grandmother’s name is Mst. Jamila Begum who had one 
son Mirza Fazal Hussain Baig and two daughters namely Bashir 
Begum & Rasheeda Begum; that her maternal grandfather’s 
name was Fazal Hussain Baig who had two children, one 
daughter Shafqat Parveen (who is mother of plaintiff) and one 
son Pervaiz Ahmad; that she and Mirza Imran Baig are issues of 

 
C.R.No.16524/2023

Mst. Shafqat Parveen; that her father’s name is Mirza Ejaz Baig 
who died on 22.07.2015; that Mst. Jamila Begum was owner of 
land measuring 13 Kanal 02 Marla in Moza Mota Singh Wala 
Tehsil Cantt. District Lahore; that after death of Mst. Jamila 
Begum, the property was to be partitioned among the legal heirs; 
that legal heirs of Rasheeda Begum and her maternal uncle, 
Mirza Pervez Ahmad Baig with inter-se collusiveness got 
incorporated mutation No.649 dated 19.01.2000 and deprived 
other legal heirs; that Mirza Parvez Ahmed died in 2003 and he 
had four children, two sons Kashif Mughal & Ali Mughal and 
two daughters Saima Mughal and Sana Mughal who were living 
in village and inheritance of Mirza Parvez was incorporated in 
their name without knowledge of the plaintiffs. She produced in 
evidence copy of mutation (Exh.P.2), Nikah Nama dated 
27.06.1975 (Exh.P.3); that the legal heirs of Bashir Begum filed 
an appeal on 29.04.2003 against mutation No.649 dated 
19.01.2000 and mutation was cancelled on 14.01.2004; that 
against said order, Sharifan Bibi filed an appeal before Executive 
District Officer (Revenue) Lahore which was dismissed on 
17.03.2012; that from legal heirs of Pervez Ahmad only Saima 
Mughal and Sana Mughal are alive whereas his sons have passed 
away. Abid Akram Khan (P.W.2) deposed that:

Despite lengthy cross examination the stance taken by the P.Ws 
could not specifically be shattered by the other side.

Conversely, 
Shabbir 
Ahmad 
(respondent/defendant) 
himself appeared as his sole witness as D.W.1 and controverted 
the assertions made by the P.Ws.

(emphasis supplied)  
 
The respondents/defendants never filed any application before the 
appellate Court to re-examine as well as cross examine the 
respondents No.4 & 5.  
 
The legal heirs of Bashir Begum including the 
petitioners/plaintiffs filed an appeal before the Collector, Lahore 
Cantt. for the cancellation of Mutation No.649 which was 
accepted vide order dated 14.01.2004 (Exh.D.16), the said 
mutation was set aside and direction was passed to the concerned 
Revenue Officer to decide the matter of inheritance of Mst. 
Jamila Begum afresh after providing opportunity of hearing to all 

 
C.R.No.16524/2023

the parties concerned. The said order was assailed by 
respondents/Mst. Sharifan Bibi etc. through an appeal before the 
Additional Commissioner (Revenue), Lahore Division, Lahore 
which was dismissed vide order dated 17.03.2012.  
  
Further legal heirs of Bashir Begum etc. also filed a suit 
for declaration and challenged the validity of impugned 
inheritance mutation No.649 as well as the subsequent 
transactions. The copy of said suit as well as its proceedings was 
placed on record by the P.W.2 as Exh.P.15. It is interesting to 
note that at the time of exhibiting the said documents, the trial 
Court observed that this document is consisted of 12 pages but 
alongwith the record only five pages are available. Thus, while 
taking judicial notice and for resolving the real controversy 
between the parties, the record of said suit was requisitioned 
which has become available. In the said suit (Exh.P.15), present 
petitioners were arrayed as defendants No.11 to 13. The plaintiffs 
in the said suit stated with regard to the relationship of the parties 
in paragraph No.2 & 3 of plaint which are reproduced as under: 
 “2. 
That the said Super predecessor (Grand Mother and 
Super Grand Mother of the plaintiffs) namely Jamila Begum 
died a long ago leaving behind one son Namely Fazal Hussain 
and two daughters namely Bashir Begum & Rashida Begum 
(All have died). 
3. 
That the said Fazal Hussain died leaving behind one son 
namely Mirza Pervaiz Ahmed Baig and a daughter Shafqat 
Begum (both died). The said Mirza Pervaiz Ahmed Baig died 
leaving behind defendants No.8 to 10 as his surviving spouses. 
Whereas the said Shafqat Begum D/o Fazal Hussain was died 
leaving behind defendants No.11 to 13 as her living spouses/ 
legal heirs.” 
The present petitioners [who were defendants No.11 to 13] while 
filing written statement contended that they are legal heirs of Mst. 
Shafqat Parveen. Further, the defendants No.8 to 10 [children of 
Mirza Parvez Ahmad Baig who are respondents No.4 & 5 in this 
civil revision] while filing the written statement in the said suit 

 
C.R.No.16524/2023

also admitted the aforementioned facts as correct. The respondent 
No.2/Mst. Sharifan Bibi [who was defendant No.4 in the said 
suit] while filing her written statement also admitted the contents 
of para No.3 of the plaint as correct. Mst. Sharifan Bibi filed an 
application under Order VII Rule 11 C.P.C. in the said suit 
wherein the pedigree table of Mst. Jamila Begum was prepared 
which also shows Mst. Shafqat Begum as daughter of Fazal 
Hussain. For reference, relevant portion of said pedigree table is 
reproduced as under:

Moreover, the defendants No.14, 15 & 17 to 23 in the said suit 
filed an application for transposing them as plaintiffs as they 
were also aggrieved of the inheritance mutation No.649. The said 
suit was withdrawn on 23.06.2009 on the basis of a compromise 
between the parties. Bashir Ahmad (D.W.1) while recording his 
statement in instant suit also admitted that a compromise was 
made in the aforesaid suit. He also admitted that the appeal titled 
Sharifan Bibi Vs. Iqbal Ahmad Khan etc. was dismissed by the 
Additional Commissioner Lahore on 17.03.2012. It is settled law 

 
C.R.No.16524/2023

that presumption of correctness/sanctity/truth is attached to the 
judicial proceedings/judicial record.1  
6.  
As the petitioners/plaintiffs challenged the inheritance 
mutation while in the plaint asserting the existence of fraud and 
subsequently proved the same through cogent evidence, thus onus 
was shifted upon the respondents/defendants to prove the validity 
of the said mutation through affirmative and corroborative 
evidence but they failed to dislodge the onus.2  
7.  
The petitioners/plaintiffs through cogent, trustworthy & 
concrete oral as well as documentary evidence proved that Mst. 
Shafqat Parveen is daughter of Mirza Fazal Hussain Baig as such 
she was/is also entitled to inherit from the estate left by Mirza 
Fazal Hussain but Mirza Parvez Ahmad Baig, real brother of Mst. 
Shafqat Parveen in order to deprive her from the legacy, did not 
mention her name while incorporating the impugned inheritance 
mutation.  
8. 
So far as the Nikah Nama (Exh.P.3) of Mst. Shafqat 
Parveen on which basis the Courts below have non-suited the 
petitioners is concerned, it appears that tempering was made with 
the name of Fazal Hussain Baig and it has been shown as Afzal 
Hussain Baig. Further, D.W.1 in his cross examination admitted 
that address of Shafqat Parveen in Nikah Nama is written as 111-
Samanabad Lahore and that property was owned by Mst. Jamila 
Begum, predecessor-in-interest of the parties of the lis. This fact 
also shows that Mst. Shafqat Parveen was daughter of Mirza 
Fazal Hussain.  
9. 
Admittedly, the moment Mirza Fazal Hussain Baig closed 
his eyes, all his legal heirs according to the principles of Quran & 
                                          
1 Muhammad Ramzan Vs. Lahore Development Authority, Lahore (2002 SCMR 1336) and 
Waqar Jalal Ansari Vs. National Bank of Pakistan & Another (2008 SCMR 1611) 
2 Muhammad Akram & Another Vs. Altaf Ahmad (PLD 2003 SC 688) and Amjad Ikram Vs. 
Mst.Asiya Kausar and 2 others (2015 SCMR 1) 

 
C.R.No.16524/2023

Sharia became absolute owner to the extent of their respective 
shares in estate of the deceased and without resorting to the legal 
course of independent transaction, the said ownership cannot be 
taken away by means of any unauthorized entry in the revenue 
record and if any entry is made in clandestine manner with 
collusiveness of the revenue staff, such entry is devoid of any 
legality and creating any valid right. The main object of 
registration and sanctioning of mutation of inheritance is mere 
formality to update the official record whereas all legal heirs of a 
deceased become absolute owners of the property to the extent of 
their respective share until and unless they themselves voluntarily 
and legally further alienate their said share/right and the said legal 
heirs by operation of law become joint owners in the estate 
having constructive possession over their share and no limitation 
runs against the inheritance matters as well as against any 
patently void order/entry.3  
10.  
From the above, it can conveniently be observed that the 
petitioners/plaintiffs successfully proved their case through solid, 
concrete & trustworthy oral as well as documentary evidence but 
the two courts below who by committing mis-reading and non-
reading of the evidence decided issues No.1, 2 & 5 against the 
petitioners/plaintiffs and the said findings of the Courts below on 
these issues are not sustainable in the eyes of law which are hereby 
reversed and these issues are decided in favour of the petitioners/ 
plaintiffs and against the respondents/defendants. 
11. 
As the decisions of the lower fora suffer from blatant mis-
reading and non-reading of the evidence as well as mis-
application of law, as such the same are not sustainable in the 
eyes of law and are liable to be set-aside and this Court is well 
                                          
3  Ghulam Ali and 2 others Vs. Mst. Ghulam Sarwar Naqvi (PLD 1990 SC 1) and Ghulam 
Qasim and others Vs. Mst. Razia Begum and others (PLD 2021 SC 812)  

 
C.R.No.16524/2023 
 
11
within jurisdiction under section 115 CPC to interfere with illegal 
and perverse concurrent findings of the lower fora.4  
12. 
In view of above, this civil revision is allowed, the 
judgment & decree dated 08.10.2021 passed by the trial Court as 
well as judgment & decree dated 02.12.2022 passed by the 
appellate Court are hereby set aside and the suit for declaration 
filed by the petitioners/plaintiffs is hereby decreed as prayed for 
with costs throughout.
