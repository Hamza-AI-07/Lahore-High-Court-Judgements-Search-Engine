Petitioners by:

MIRZA VIQAS RAUF, J. The petitioners are the 
registered distribution contractors under their respective names and 
styles for various categories of ditching, backfilling, reinstatement, 
etc. with the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (hereinafter 
referred to as “SNGPL”). It is asserted by the petitioners that in the 
year 2018 at the time of pre-qualification of distribution contractors 
for enlistment, the respondent-company introduced an invitation to 
bid/tender inquiry document wherein an amount of Rs.2,00,000/- as 
refundable security was fixed which was paid by the petitioners 
including the other contractors without any objection. As per 
contents of the petition, in the year 2020-2021 the same criterion 
was repeated for the purpose of pre-qualification for enlistment of 
distribution contractors. In furtherance thereof, the petitioners 
deposited an amount of Rs.20,000,00/- with respondents No.4 & 5 

Writ Petition No.4315 of 2023 
-2- 
 
with their free will and consent. It is the stance of the petitioners 
that in the meanwhile one of the contractors from Islamabad region 
challenged the condition of security amount before the Islamabad 
High Court through constitutional petition, which was allowed and 
in pursuance thereto, the respondent-company decided to refund 
security amount to the contractors of all region in order to avoid 
any further controversy and instead issued memorandum dated 13th 
September, 2023 wherein it is decided to return the security amount 
deposited by the contractors against their pre-qualification and 
proceeded to adopt a new procedure laid therein. Feeling aggrieved 
the petitioners moved their respective applications to respondent 
No.4 but on account of non-decision, the petitioners filed Writ 
Petition No.3798 of 2023, which was disposed of by way of order 
dated 16th November, 2023 directing the respondent No.4 to decide 
the applications of the petitioners within a period of one month 
from the receipt of certified copy of the order strictly in accordance 
with law by providing opportunity of hearing to all concerned. In 
pursuance thereof, through decision dated 15th December, 2023 the 
applications of the petitioners were turned down, hence this petition 
under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973.   
2. 
On this petition notice was issued to the respondents, who 
submitted their written statement wherein the maintainability of the 
instant petition is questioned on the ground that matter in issue 
relates to the terms and conditions of the contract, which cannot be 
enforced through writ jurisdiction. It is further asserted by the 
respondents that memorandum dated 13th September, 2023 had 
been issued in compliance of the order of the Islamabad High Court 
Islamabad and the conditions imposed therein were inserted only to 
safeguard the company’s interest. 
3. 
Heard. Record perused. 
4. 
The petitioners are admittedly enlisted as distribution 
contractors with the “SNGPL”. The petitioners were awarded 
respective contracts for ditching, backfilling, reinstatement, etc. on 

Writ Petition No.4315 of 2023 
-3- 
 
09th March, 2021 through a written contract which was for three 
years from issuance of pre-qualification letter by the respondents. It 
is an admitted fact that the contract period of the petitioners is to 
expire in March, 2024. As per Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) 
for pre-qualification of distribution contractors, the contractor who 
was pre-qualified/enlisted for the company shall provide within ten 
days a performance bond of 05% of contract value below 
(excluding PST) in shape of CDR/pay order/demand draft or bank 
guarantee issued by a scheduled bank in Pakistan. The petitioners 
after being declared as pre-qualified/enlisted contractors deposited 
Rs.20,00,000/- with the respondents in terms of the contract. In the 
meanwhile, the respondents issued memorandum dated 13th 
September, 2023 in the light of decision of the Islamabad High 
Court, Islamabad wherein they decided to return the security 
amount deposited by each contractor against their pre-qualification 
and instead they were asked to comply the following conditions :- 
1. 
The contractor will provide 5% Performance 
Bond/Warranty of the total value of the Work Order 
before assigning the Work Order/Contract (excluding 
casual labour payment), in shape of Pay-Order / Demand 
Draft issued by a scheduled bank in Pakistan. 
2. 
In case of jobs currently in progress / assigned to 
contractors, it must be ensured that 5% Performance Bond 
is obtained before returning of Security amount. 
3. 
The 5% of the total FPC amount shall be withheld 
as retention money. 
4. 
Both, performance bond / retention money, shall be 
released after 06 months from completion of the work 
(subject to the condition that work carried out by the 
contractor is satisfactory as per Company’s SOPs). 
5. 
The first and foremost question which arises herein is that as 
to whether a memorandum can be given effect retrospectively. It is 
an admitted position on the record that the petitioners were awarded 
work and in terms thereof work order was issued on 09th March, 
2021 for three years, which has to expire in the next month. It is 

Writ Petition No.4315 of 2023 
-4- 
 
trite law that a notification/memorandum or an executive order 
cannot operate retrospectively unless it is specifically provided 
therein. Through memorandum dated 13th September, 2023 the 
respondents decided to return the security amount deposited by the 
petitioners and instead they were directed to fulfill the conditions 
mentioned hereinabove for their pre-qualification. 
6. 
As already observed that the contracts awarded to the 
petitioners would expire in March, 2024 and it is not the case of the 
respondents that the petitioners failed to abide the terms and 
conditions of the contracts. In such a situation any condition 
detrimental to the interest of the petitioners cannot be introduced 
during the currency of the already executed contract. Reference to 
this effect can be made to GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN through 
Secretary Establishment Division, Islamabad versus MUHAMMAD ISMAIL 
and another (2021 SCMR 1246). 
7. 
The root cause for issuance of impugned memorandum is the 
decision of the Islamabad High Court Islamabad in Writ Petition 
No.186 of 2022. Perusal whereof reveals that one of the contractors 
registered in Islamabad region with the “SNGPL” being aggrieved 
of the decision of the company to demand the payment of security 
deposit for enlistment of the contractors approached the Islamabad 
High Court challenging the said demand. In that backdrop the 
demand made by “SNGPL” for the deposit of security in Invitation 
to Bid (ITB) as a condition of enlistment of contractors was 
declared as unlawful and violative of the Public Procurement Rules, 
2004. 
8. 
There is no cavil that this Court in exercise of constitutional 
jurisdiction can neither settle the terms and conditions of the 
contract interse parties nor direct the executive to insert or exclude 
certain condition in the contract, which undoubtedly is within the 
domain of the executive. There is also no denial to the proposition 
that in the matter of enforcement of contractual obligations, this 
Court in ordinary course abstains to exercise constitutional 
jurisdiction for enforcement of the terms and conditions of the 
contract or to remedy the breach of contract but at the same time 

Writ Petition No.4315 of 2023 
-5- 
 
the constitutional jurisdiction cannot be abridged if some perversity 
or patent illegality is floating on the surface of the record. It is an 
oft repeated principle of law that though constitutional jurisdiction 
ordinarily should not be exercised in case of breach of contract but 
if such breach does not entail any inquiry or examination of minute 
or controversial questions of fact, if committed by Government, 
semi-Government or Local Authorities it can adequately be 
addressed in exercise of jurisdiction contemplated under Article 
199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. 
Guidance to this effect can be sought from Messrs AIRPORT 
SUPPORT SERVICES versus THE AIRPORT MANAGER, QUAID-E-AZAM 
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, KARACHI and others (1998 SCMR 2268). The 
relevant extract from the same is reproduced below :- 
“Neither of the conclusions of the High Court is sustainable. It 
has consistently been held that while routine contractual 
disputes between private parties and public functionaries are 
not open to scrutiny under the Constitutional jurisdiction, 
breaches of such contracts, which do not entail inquiry into or 
examination of minute or controversial questions of fact, if 
committed by Government, semi-Government or Local 
Authorities or like controversies if involving dereliction of 
obligations, flowing from a statute, rules or instructions can 
adequately be addressed for relief under that jurisdiction. 
Further a contract, carrying elements of public interest, 
concluded by functionaries of the State, has to be just, fair, 
transparent, reasonable and free of any taint of mala fides, all 
such aspects remaining open for judicial review. The rule is 
founded on the premises that public functionaries, deriving 
authority from or under law, are obligated to act justly, fairly 
equitably, reasonably, without any element of discrimination 
and squarely within the parameters of law, as applicable in a 
given situation. Deviations, if of substance, can be corrected 
through appropriate orders under Article 199 of the 
Constitution. In such behalf even where a contract, pure and 
simple, is involved, provided always that public element 
presents itself and the dispute does not entail evidentiary facts 
of a disputed nature, redress may be provided. A number of 
precedents have contextually come to-occupy the field and, 
inter alia, may to noted (1) Anjuman-e-Ahmadiya, Sargodha v. 
Deputy Commissioner, Sargodha, PLD 1966 SC 639, (2) The 
D.F.O. South Khari v. Ram Sanehi Singh, 1971 (3) Supreme

Reference to the above effect can also be made to HAZARA (HILL 
TRACT) IMPROVEMENT TRUST through Chairman and others versus Mst. 
QAISRA ELAHI and others (2005 SCMR 678). 
9. 
In the case of Messrs AMEER KHAN & CO. versus GOVERNMENT 
OF THE PUNJAB through Secretary, Local Government, Lahore (PLD 2010 
Lahore 443) in somewhat similar circumstances this Court held as 
under :- 
“The preliminary objections taken by the respondents with 
regard to the maintainability of this petition are to be addressed 
in the first instance. There can be no cavil with the proposition 
that routine contractual disputes between private parties are not 
to be scrutinized by this court while exercising its 
extraordinary constitutional jurisdiction under Article 199 of 
the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973. 
However, an exception to this rule would be that this court 
would have the jurisdiction to examine a contract concluded by 
public functionaries which do not entail any factual inquiry and 
it would be open to judicial review, since such contracts have 
to be just, fair, transparent and reasonable. Similarly, bar of 
proceedings as envisaged under the Arbitration Act, 1940 
would not take away this court's jurisdiction of judicial review 
in matters emanating from a contract concluded between 
private individuals and State functionaries as has been held by 
the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in Messrs Airport 
Support Services v. The Airport Manager, Quaid-e-Azam 
International Airport, Karachi and others 1998 SCMR 2268.” 
Reliance in this regard can also be placed on DEWAN PETROLEUM 
(PVT.) and others versus GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN and others (PLD 
2010 Lahore 404).  
10. 
In the case of HAJI AMIN versus PAKISTAN TRADING 
CORPORATION (PVT.) LTD and another (PLD 2009 Karachi 112) the 
Sindh High Court held as under :- 

Writ Petition No.4315 of 2023 
-7- 
 
“Normally a writ for the enforcement of a contractual 
obligation is not maintainable. However State and any 
functionary acting under the State has to act in a fair and 
transparent manner and, if disputed question of facts are not 
involved relief in exercise of power under Art.199 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973 in 
appropriate matters have not been denied, merely because 
issues in the matter relates to contractual obligation.” 
11. 
The petitioners have not canvassed any issue involving 
intricacy of facts. They have entered into a lawful contract with 
“SNGPL” on the terms and conditions settled by the latter, so now 
the petitioners could not be confronted with conditions, which are 
alien to existing contract and prejudicial to the interest of the 
petitioners almost at the fag end of the contractual period. Needless 
to reiterate that the terms of impugned memorandum can be 
enforced for the upcoming contracts provided these are in accord 
with law.  
12. 
Needless to mention here that right of trade and business is 
guaranteed under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973. While discharging official functions efforts should 
be made to ensure that no one should be denied to earn his 
livelihood because of the unfair or discriminatory treatment on the 
part of any State functionary. Guidance to this effect can be sought 
from SHAUKAT ALI and others versus GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN 
through Chairman, Ministry of Railways and others (PLD 1997 Supreme 
Court 342). 
13. 
For the foregoing reasons, this petition is partly allowed, the 
impugned order dated 15th December, 2023 is set aside being illegal 
and unlawful, as a result thereof, the respondents are restrained 
from refunding the security already deposited and asking the 
petitioners to abide notification dated 13th September, 2023 for the 
current contracts with no order as to costs.
