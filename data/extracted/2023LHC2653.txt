JAWAD HASSAN, J. This Intra Court Appeal under Section 3 of the Law 
Reforms Ordinance, 1972 has been filed against the impugned order dated 
16.12.2020, passed by the learned Single Judge whereby Writ Petition bearing 
No.68810 of 2019 filed by the Respondent No.1 was allowed. 
2. 
Brief facts giving rise to filing of this Appeal are that the Respondent 
No.1 
purchased 
a 
vehicle/Mercedes 
300 
SE 
Coupe, 
Chassis 
No.11202122009480, Model 1967 from one Raza Hussain and claimed it to 
be a “Vintage Car” duly covered under PCT Code 87.03 of the First Schedule 
to the Customs Act, 1969 and pursuant to SRO 833(I)/2018, dated 03.07.2018 
(the “SRO) and other relevant rules and regulations on the subject imported 
in Pakistan which makes the vehicle exempted from Customs, Regulatory 
Excise duties, Sales Tax and Withholding Income tax. He submitted all the 
necessary documents for its release but the same was refused by the 
Appellant-department on the ground that the aforementioned SRO was in 
violation of Paragraph No.20 of the Import Policy Order 2016 and unless the 
concerned Ministry amends the Policy of 2016 to bring it in conformity with 
the SRO 833(I)/2018, dated 03.07.2018, such vintage vehicle could not be 
released. This very situation was confronted to the Appellant-department who 

I.C.A.No. 1197 of 2021 
 
           2 
through its Report, Parawise comments and Arguments rebutted stance of the 
Respondent No.1 with the submissions that exemption claimed by the Writ 
Petitioner was admissible only if corresponding amendment regarding import 
of vintage or classic cars is made in the Import Policy Order, 2016, by the 
Ministry of Commerce/the Competent Authority.   
3. 
Mr. Waqar A. Sheikh, ASC contended that while passing the impugned 
order, the learned Single Judge did not take into account that under Appendix-
C of the Policy Order, 2016, the vehicle in question was included in the list of 
items not importable in used/second-hand condition, similarly, in accordance 
with the Appendix-E of the said Policy Order more than three years old cars 
are not allowed to be imported in Pakistan while the vehicle in question 
pertains to Model-1967. Moreover, the vintage/classic cars are not included in 
regulating provision of the Import Policy Order; that Serial No.10 of 
Appendix-C has been inserted in the Import Policy Order only to give import 
cover to certain types of vehicles and, therefore, has a very limited scope and 
that the regulating provisions for import of vehicles into Pakistan is prescribed 
under Appendix-E of the IPO; that the Ministry of Commerce in terms of 
Serial No.5 Schedule-II of the Rules of Business, 1973 has the exclusive 
domain to regulate imports and exports and, therefore, the Ministry of 
Finance, Economic Affairs, Statistics and Revenue Division has no 
jurisdiction to regulate it by issuing the SRO 833(I)/2018, dated 03.07.2018, 
thus, no benefit can be given to the Respondent No.1 qua the said SRO and 
that even otherwise, Board’s SRO 833(I)/2018, dated 03.07.2018, is meant for 
to regulate the calculations, duties and taxes only; that the Writ 
Petitioner/Importer of the vehicle in question mis-declared the HS Code of the 
vehicle as 8703.5059 to avail undue exception from the negative list of HS 
Code provided in Appendix-C while the declared HS Code is specified in the 
Pakistan Customs Tariff for Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) only whereas 
the vehicle in question is a vintage/classic car which is correctly classifiable 
under HS Code 8703.3390 which is included in the list of HS Codes not 
importable as per Serial No.10 of Appendix-C of the Import Policy Order, 
2016; that it was the Paragraph No.8 of the Import Policy according to which 

I.C.A.No. 1197 of 2021 
 
           3 
any dispute or clarification regarding import status of any item which cannot 
be resolved by the Customs Authorities shall be referred to Ministry of 
Commerce for final decision. Reiterating that Import Policy 2016 allows only 
the import of used cars less than three years old; that the Ministry of 
Commerce has the exclusive domain to regulate imports and exports; that the 
Ministry of Finance, Economic Affairs, Statistics and Revenue Division has 
jurisdiction only qua Tax Policy, Tax administration and its ancillary matters 
and thus has no concern with the regulation of imports and exports and that 
application of the SRO 833(I)/2018, dated 03.07.2018 has wrongly been 
construed while passing the impugned order and the learned counsel, 
therefore, seeks setting aside of the same placing reliance on 2020 PTD 660 
Sindh High Court and 2021 PTD 407 Sindh High Court.          
4. 
Mr. Ali Sibtain Fazli, ASC contended that the Respondent No.1 
purchased a vintage Mercedes 300 SE Coupe, Chassis No.11202122009480, 
Model 1967 from one Raza Hussain and imported in Pakistan under the SRO 
833(I)/2018, dated 03.07.2018 thereby exemption from Customs duty, 
Regulatory duty, Additional Customs duty, Federal Excise duty, Sales Tax 
and Withholding Tax in excess of the cumulative of US$5000 per unit has 
been allowed. Moreover, he submitted all the relevant documents for its 
release along with G.D. before the Deputy Collector Customs, Dry port, 
Lahore, who refused to do so on the ground that despite the fact that, the SRO 
833(I)/2018, dated 03.07.2018 is still in field, yet a corresponding Notification 
under the Import Policy Order, 2016 is essential for release of the vehicle 
which is to be done by the Ministry of Commerce. The Respondent No.1 
being aggrieved of this observation of Deputy Collector Customs filed the 
aforementioned Writ Petition asserting that the vehicle fell under PCT 
Heading 8703.5059 and that in terms of the SRO 833(I)/2018, dated 
03.07.2018; the Appellant-department has no authority to refuse to release the 
vehicle. Maintains that learned counsel for the Appellant-department failed to 
establish that the vintage vehicle imported by the Respondent No.1 fell under 
the banned items; Further maintains that the Principle of Judicial Estoppel is 
fully applicable, as on the one hand the Appellant-department did not dispute 

I.C.A.No. 1197 of 2021 
 
           4 
the PCT Code of the vehicle in their Parawise comments while on the other 
hand asserted that imported vehicle fell within the banned category, therefore, 
the Appellant is estopped by its conduct to take divergent stance before the 
Court. It is further contended by learned counsel for the Respondent No.1 that 
the judgment relied upon by the Appellant is not applicable because the issue 
before the Sindh High Court and Islamabad High Court was different from the 
case in hand, as admittedly, the PCT Code 8703.5050 does not fall within the 
category of banned items. Adds that admittedly the SRO dated 03.07.2018 has 
still not been withdrawn thereby Ministry of Finance, Economic Affairs, 
Statistics and Revenue (Revenue Division) Government of Pakistan has 
exempted vintage or classic cars and jeeps meant for transport of persons. 
Placing reliance on a case reported as Federal Board of Revenue etc. versus 
Kh. Saad Saleem and another (PTCL 2015 CL 313) submitted that even 
smuggled vehicles have been released in past on payment of duties and taxes 
while his case is based on legal norms in all respects, as the learned Single 
Judge noted in the order being impugned through this Appeal. Thus prays for 
dismissal of this Appeal with a direction to the Appellant department to 
release the vehicle on the carpet in terms of the SRO 833(I)/2018, dated 
03.07.2018, which is still in field.  
5. 
Heard. Record perused. 
6. 
As per contention of learned counsel for the Appellant the learned 
Single Judge while passing the impugned order dated 16.12.2020 should have 
taken into account that it was/is not the Appellant who has the jurisdiction to 
release the vehicle in question rather it was/is the Ministry of Commerce 
having exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the Import and Export of the vehicles 
and that as per Clause 5(A)(vii) the goods as specified in Appendix-C are 
banned upon import in secondhand or used condition and that as the vehicle is 
of Model 1967, therefore, it was not included in the category of vehicles 
importable under Appendix-E of the Import Policy Order, 2016 because more 
than three years’ old cars are not allowed to be imported in Pakistan. 
Furthermore, HS Code of the impugned vehicle has also been misconstrued by 
the learned Single Judge.  

I.C.A.No. 1197 of 2021 
 
           5 
7. 
The Vehicle imported by the Respondent No.1 is claimed to be covered 
under PCT Code 87.03 of First Schedule to the Customs Act, 1969 and 
pursuant to SRO 833(I)/2018 dated 03.07.2018. Language of said Code 
pertains to Motor cars and other motor vehicles principally designed for the 
transport of persons (other than those of heading 87.02) including station 
wagons and racing cars while as per the SRO dated 03.7.2018, the Federal 
Government, Ministry of Finance, Economic Affairs, Statistics and Revenue 
has exempted vintage or classic cars from duties and taxes mentioned above. 
8. 
 A minute perusal of the SRO 833(I)/2018, dated 03.07.2018 and 
Paragraph No.20 of the Import Policy Order 2016 make it crystal clear that 
only afore-referred Taxes and Duties have been exempted on an importable 
item i.e. the vehicle in this case. Now the second question would be; ‘what is 
the impediment in importing the vehicle in question in Pakistan by the 
Respondent No.1’. To answer this, we have to go back to the claim of the 
Respondent No.1 that the vehicle pertains to year 1967 and putting in 
juxtaposition with The Gazette of Pakistan, Extra, April 18, 2016 [Part-II] we 
shall come to know about “Eligibility and Condition” for Pakistan 
Nationals to import or gift a vehicle, which reads as under:- 
“3. 
Conditions of Import---(1) Vehicles more than 
five years old shall not be allowed to be imported under 
gift, personal baggage and transfer of residence 
schemes, but this condition shall not apply to 
secondhand or used bullet proof vehicles, if imported 
under these schemes: 
(2)   Cars older than three years shall not be allowed 
to be imported under gift, personal baggage and 
transfer of residence schemes. 
Explanation----the age of vehicle shall be determined 
from the Ist January of the year subsequent to the year 
of manufacture till the date of shipment as per bill of 
lading.” 

I.C.A.No. 1197 of 2021 
 
           6 
From this, it is established that one of the main barriers in import of the vehicle 
in question is the above elucidation, according to which import of 1967 Model 
vehicle cannot be allowed, however, it can only be allowed to be imported when 
the Federal Government through the Ministry of Commerce (the Regulatory 
Authority) relaxes the prohibition on import of above category of vehicles. As 
for application of the SRO is concerned, as stated above, it does not provide 
importability of the vehicle in question but exemption of levy of aforesaid taxes 
and duties only.  
9.  
There is no denial that earlier in some identical cases titled Moin Jamal 
Abbasi Versus The Federation of Pakistan (2020 PTD 660) and Meena 
Munawar Khan Versus Federation of Pakistan (2021 PTD 407) Sindh and 
Islamabad High Courts respectively had directed the Customs Department to 
release the vintage vehicles on payment of US$5000/- in terms of said SRO 
dated 03.07.2018 to the writ petitioners in said cases. However, the matter in 
hand requires deeper appreciation and analysis. 
10. 
The most important issue is the question of domain/jurisdiction of the 
Ministry of Commerce and Trade and Ministry of Finance, Economic Affairs, 
Statistics and Revenue Division, Government of Pakistan regarding the import of 
vintage vehicle. It is pertinent to mention here that subsequent to  the passing of 
supra judgment in Meena Munwar case, a Summary dated 11.01.2019 was 
submitted by the Ministry of Commerce and Textile Industry to the Economic 
Coordination Committee of the Cabinet for permission to import of vintage cars. 
Although the proposal was considered by the Economic Coordination Committee 
of the Cabinet in its meeting held on 15.01.2019, yet the same was not approved. 
The Economic Coordination Committee’s decisions taken in its meeting was 
ratified by the Cabinet on 24.01.2019. Thus it is the Ministry of Commerce which 
is to allow importability or relaxation in Import Policy 2016. In this regard, the 
report submitted on behalf of Secretary, Ministry of Commerce in compliance of 
this Court’s order makes this issue more clear, which reads as under:- 
“……the SRO No.833(I)/2018 has been issued by 
the Revenue Division which stipulates conditions 
of levy of tax/duty of US$5000 per unit. Import 

I.C.A.No. 1197 of 2021 
 
           7 
Policy Order 2016 does not allow import of cars 
older than three years under any scheme. The 
said SRO being issued under the Customs Act 
1969 has nothing to do with Import and Export 
Control Act, 1950 which is the law regulating 
imports and exports.” 
Before summing the matter, we would like to refer the judgment passed in 
Imad Samad and others Versus Federation of Pakistan through Secretary 
Commerce and 3 others (2021 PTD 2063) by the Full Bench of Sindh High 
Court wherein the precise question framed was as under:- 
“Whether the subject SRO No. 833(I)/2018 issued 
in terms of Section 19 of Customs Act, 1969, can 
also be treated as SRO issued by the Ministry of 
Commerce in terms of Section of the Import & 
Export Control Act, 1950, permitting import of 
vintage cars which are otherwise not importable 
as being old and used in terms of the Import 
Policy Order of both 2016 and 2020.” 
The Full Bench held that no writ can be issued to the Customs Department 
for the release of vintage car when the Import Policy Order issued under 
Section 3(I) of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, 1950 (“the 1950 Act”) 
does not expressly permit import of such vehicles. However, while disposing 
of the case the Full Bench directed the Federal Government to consider the 
case of the Petitioners for one-time relaxation/permit of import under Clause 
21 of the Import Policy Order, 2020 in respect of vintage cars falling under 
SRO 833(I)/2018 already imported by them, and to decide the same within 
10-days keeping in mind the observations made therein. Subsequently, In 
compliance with the directions of the High Court of Sindh in the judgment 
dated 10.09.2021, the matter regarding one-time relaxation in prohibition of 
import of vintage cars was placed before the Cabinet. On 02.11.2021, the 
Cabinet did not approve the proposal for the grant of one-time relaxation.  

I.C.A.No. 1197 of 2021 
 
           8 
11. 
Although the said Notification/SRO No.833(I)/2018, dated 03.07.2018 
has not been withdrawn, yet the fact remains that after the supra Judgment in 
Imad Samad and others case, the Cabinet would be presumed to be 
cognizant of the disparity between the said SRO and Import Policy Orders 
dated 2016 and 2020. Being cognizant of this disparity, the Cabinet has taken 
an informed decision not to grant one-time relaxation in the prohibition of 
import of vintage cars. In other words, the Cabinet has decided not to amend 
the Import Policy orders so as to make the import of vintage cars more than 
three years old permissible. 
12. 
 The upshot of above discussion is that there is nothing in the SRO 
833(I)/2018, dated 03.07.2018 which allows the import of vintage cars, 
therefore, being not in agreement with the observations made by the learned 
Single Judge qua allowing import of the vehicle in question, this Appeal is 
allowed and the order dated 16.12.2020 is set aside.
