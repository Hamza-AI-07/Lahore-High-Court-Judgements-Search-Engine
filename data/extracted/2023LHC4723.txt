I.

The Petitioners are practicing advocates being active members 
of the High Court Bar Association Rawalpindi and District Bar 
Association, Rawalpindi and according to them, they have been 

W.P.No.3222 of 2021 
 
       2 
engaged as legal advisors by the Administrator Municipal Corporation 
Tehsil Murree, District Rawalpindi for the Lahore High Court, 
Rawalpindi Bench and District Courts Rawalpindi as well. They claim 
that their retainership fee was fixed as Rs.20,000/- (for Lahore High 
Court, Rawalpindi Bench) and Rs.15000/- (for District Courts, 
Rawalpindi) respectively. As per their version, they have been 
engaged through letter No.159 dated 19.12.2019 and letter No.501 
dated 21.03.2020. Their sole grievance is that the Respondents have 
withheld their professional/retainership fee since June, 2019 for the 
services provided to them as legal advisors.  
II. 
PETITIONERS ARGUMENTS 
3. 
The Petitioners argued that they have been engaged as legal 
advisors by the Administrator Municipal Corporation Tehsil, Murree, 
District Rawalpindi pursuant to which they conducted cases before 
this Court as well as District Courts, Rawalpindi however, their 
professional fee has been withheld by the Respondents without 
reason. They further argued that the Respondent No.2 in report and 
parawise comments has admitted regarding rendering of their services 
for the said Respondent but due to reasons best known to the 
Respondents, claimed payment has not been made so far.  
III. 
RESPONDENTS ARGUMENTS 
  
a. 
Respondents No.1&2/Municipal Corporation, Murree  
4. 
Ch. Sarfraz Ahmad Chadhar, Advocate/Legal Advisor for the 
Respondents No.1&2 filed report and parawise comments whereby it 
was stated that the period of appointment of the Petitioners had ended 
on 31st May, 2019 and thereafter their appointment was not formally 
extended by the authority, however, they kept on rendering their 
services as legal advisors. It was further stated that the Respondents 
had written numerous letters to the concerned authority for the 
continuation of petitioners’ contract but no reply was received.

Respondent No.3/Secretary LG&CD Department

No.3/Secretary 
LG&CD 
Department 
vehemently

       3 
agitating that the Petitioners were never appointed by the competent 
authority to act as legal advisors, MC, Murree hence they have no 
locus standi to file this petition. It has further been stated that letters 
dated 19.12.2019 and 21.03.2020 are though addressed to the 
Secretary LG&CD Department but competent authority in the matter 
is the Secretary Law and Parliamentary Affairs Department, under the 
Punjab Local Government Legal Advisors Rules, 2003 (the “Rules”).  
 
c. 
Reply of Secretary Law & Parliamentary Affairs Deptt.  
6. 
Malik Amjad Ali, Additional Advocate General filed the report 
and parawise comments on behalf of the Secretary Law and 
Parliamentary Affairs Department denying the stance of the 
Petitioners. It has been stated that in terms of instructions dated 
22.05.2018, no department/body can engage a private advocate in 
anticipation of approval and no request for ex post facto approval will 
be entertained or granted and in case, an officer who appoints any 
private advocate, such officer shall be responsible to pay the 
professional fee from his own pocket and shall also be liable to 
disciplinary action, as per law. It has further been stated that the 
Petitioners were never appointed to act as legal advisors as three posts 
of legal advisors in Municipal Committee, Murree were occupied 
through the order of the competent authority hence, the Petitioners’ 
claim that they were appointed through letters dated 19.12.2019 and 
21.03.2020 is based on misconception.  
7. 
I have heard the arguments of counsel for the parties and 
perused the record.  
IV. 
DETERMINATION BY THE COURT  
8. 
The version of the Petitioners is that they were engaged by the 
Respondent No.2 through letters appended with this petition at 
Annex-B and Annex-C (Page 7 and 8) while on the other hand stance 
of the Respondent No.3 is that aforesaid letters do not show in any 
manner that the Petitioners were engaged by the Respondent No.2 on 
the dates mentioned therein. Admittedly, the procedure for 

W.P.No.3222 of 2021 
 
       4 
appointment, extension and renumeration of legal advisors or 
engagement of special counsel by a local government is dealt with 
under “Rules”. In order to resolve this controversy, this Court will 
interpret Rule 4 of the “Rules” which deals with the procedure for 
appointment of legal advisor. The said Rule is reproduced as under: 
4. Procedure for appointment - (1) A Local 
Government desirous of engaging a Legal Adviser on 
regular basis shall invite applications through 
advertisement at least in two National daily 
newspapers indicating the requisite qualifications, 
experience, standing of the advocate and the maximum 
remuneration offered:  
Provided that it would be clearly indicated in the 
advertisement that a Legal Adviser may be appointed 
at a remuneration, which may be less than the 
remuneration offered: Provided further that where the 
remuneration to be paid does not exceed one thousand 
rupees, the advertisement may be dispensed with.  
(2) The candidates shall be advised to address their 
applications to the Local Government concerned and 
also forward a copy of the application along with 
annexure to Government.  
(3) The Local Government concerned shall forward to 
Government all applications of the candidates along 
with its recommendations.  
(4) The recommendations received from the Local 
Government concerned shall be considered by a 
Selection Committee comprising the following:- 
(i) 
Law Minister Chairman  
(ii) 
Secretary to Government of the Punjab, 
Law & Parliamentary Affairs 
Department, Member  
(iii) 
representative of the Local Government 
& Rural Development Department who 
shall be an officer not below the rank of 
BPS-18; and Member  
(iv) 
representative of the DCO: Member 
Provided that Government may at any time alter the 
constitution of the committee or increase or decrease 
the number of its members.  
(5) The committee shall approve the name of the 
Advocate to be appointed as a Legal Adviser and the 
remuneration to be paid to him.  
(6) The Advocate approved by the committee shall be 
appointed by the Local Government concerned on the 
terms and conditions fixed by Government. 
 
9. 
Under Rule 4(1) of the “Rules”, a local government desirous 
to engage a legal advisor on regular basis shall invite applications 
through advertisement at least in two national daily newspapers 
indicating the requisite qualifications, experience, standing of the 

W.P.No.3222 of 2021 
 
       5 
advocate and minimum remuneration offered while under Rule 4(2) of 
the “Rules” the candidates are advised to address their applications to 
the local government concerned and also forward a copy thereof 
alongwith annexures to the Government as defined under Rule 2(b) of 
the “Rules” which means the Government of the Punjab in the Law & 
Parliamentary Affairs Department. In terms of Rule 4(3) of the 
“Rules”, the local government as defined under Rule 2(c) of the 
“Rules” shall forward to Government all applications of the 
candidates alongwith its recommendations which are placed before 
the Selection Committee constituted under Rule 4(4) of the “Rules”. 
Rule 4(5) of the “Rules” provides that the committee shall approve the 
name of advocate to be appointed as legal advisor and the 
remuneration to be paid to him and the said approved advocate by the 
committee is appointed by the local government concerned on the 
terms and conditions fixed by the Government.  
10. 
It is admitted by the Respondent No.2 while appearing before 
this Court on 01.03.2023 and in the report and parawise comments as 
well that appointments of the Petitioners were ended on 31.05.2019 
and same were not formally extended by the Authority and this fact 
has been affirmed by Malik Amjad Ali, Additional Advocate General. 
The said Respondent has appended letters dated 19.12.2019, 
21.03.2020 on the basis of which the Petitioners are claiming to be the 
appointees. Bare perusal of these letters reveals that the Respondent 
No.2 advertised the posts of legal advisors and in response thereto 
twelve applications were received out of which only three candidates 
namely Masood Ahmad Abbasi (Petitioner No.2), Raja Imran Khalil 
and Imran Khan were recommended by the Respondent No.2. 
Likewise, in letter dated 21.03.2020, an advice was sought from the 
Secretary LG&CD Department regarding appointment of legal 
advisor namely Mr. Jawad Asghar, Advocate and it was admitted that 
the appointment letter of said legal advisor was issued by the 
Secretary, Government of Punjab, Law & Parliamentary Department, 
Lahore. 
Importantly, 
an 
appointment 
letter 
is 
an 
official 

W.P.No.3222 of 2021 
 
       6 
communication between an employer and a candidate who is selected 
for a job position. It is a legal document that confirms the appointment 
of the candidate for a particular job opportunity containing various 
details about designation, remuneration, incentive structure, joining 
date, and other terms and conditions which is generally sent after the 
acceptance of the offer letter by the candidate. It legally binds the 
final communication between the organization and employee and 
confirms the offer made by the employer that is accepted by the 
candidate. In the case in hand, the Respondent No.2 invited 
applications in terms of Rule 4(1) of the “Rules” and forwarded the 
same alongwith recommendations as per Rule 4(3) of the “Rules” but 
these recommendations were required to be placed before the 
Selection Committee in terms of Rule 4(4) of the Rules for approval 
as per Rule 4(5) of the “Rules”. Pertinently, the Respondent 
No.2/MC, Murree appointed the Petitioners at his own without 
following the procedure provided under the “Rules” and getting 
approval from the Competent Authority while he was well aware of 
the instructions contained in letter dated 23.07.2016 followed by 
instructions dated 22.05.2018 issued by the Secretary to Government 
of Punjab, Law and Parliamentary Department. The relevant clause of 
the abovementioned instructions is reproduced as under: 
(d) 
No department/body shall engage a private advocate in 
anticipation of the approval under the aforesaid circular 
letters, and, no request for ex post facto approval will be 
entertained or granted. The office who appoints any 
private advocate in violation of the said instructions 
shall be responsible to pay the professional fee from his 
own pocket and may also be liable to disciplinary action 
in accordance with law.  
Underlying for emphases 
 
11. 
Undoubtedly, the Respondent No.2 while appearing before the 
Court on 01.03.2023 admitted that the Petitioners were appointed and 
they continued as legal advisor of the Municipality till October, 2022 
but this fact was refuted by Dr. Irshad Ahmad, Secretary Local 

W.P.No.3222 of 2021 
 
       7 
Government and Community Development Department who appeared 
before the Court on 07.03.2023 and stated that the Petitioners were 
never appointed by the Ministry of Law and Parliamentary Affairs 
Department as was required under the relevant rules as the regular 
incumbents (three in numbers) were already appointed through the 
process of law. So far as the letters/correspondence annexed by the 
Respondent No.2 with report and paraiwise comments, it is his stance 
that he wrote numerous letters to the concerned authority for approval 
of appointment as well as payment of fee but all these letters were 
issued for ex post facto approval which under the above referred 
instructions cannot be given, and same is also evident from the 
statement dated 27.03.2023 made by Mr. Ahmad Raza Sarwar, 
Additional Chief Secretary, Punjab who stated that Law Ministry 
cannot give any ex post facto sanction for the release of amount in 
question in favour of the Petitioners and the matter in issue falls 
within the domain of Administrator concerned. Moreover, the 
Petitioners have neither brought on record anything to show that at the 
time of applying for the post of legal advisors, they forwarded their 
applications to the Law & Parliamentary Affairs Department in terms 
of Rule 4(2) of the “Rules” nor valid appointment letters duly 
approved and issued by the Competent Authority has been placed on 
record hence, they have no locus standi to institute this petition. 
Furthermore, the Respondent No.2 has neither annexed documents in 
terms of Rule 4(3) of the “Rules” to show that the applications of the 
Petitioners were forwarded to the Law & Parliamentary Affairs 
Department nor the case of the Petitioners for appointment as legal 
advisors was ever placed before the Selection Committee in terms of 
Rule 4(3) of the “Rules”.  
12. 
There is no denying that Article 4 of the “Constitution” 
guarantees right of individuals to be dealt with in accordance with 
law, but at the same pedestal Article 5 (2) thereof requires obedience 
to the “Constitution” and law is the inviolable obligation of every 
citizen. Record reveals that the Petitioners were not ever appointed in 

W.P.No.3222 of 2021 
 
       8 
due course of law and the letters based by them to establish their 
alleged appointment at the most may be taken up as only 
nomination/recommendation for relevant job and it has already 
been held in “MUHAMMAD AKBAR versus FEDERATION OF 
PAKISTAN, Ministry of Law and Justice (Justice Division), 
Islamabad through Secretary and another” (1996 SCMR 1017) that 
“The Government is, therefore, not bound to accept the 
recommendation nor a vested right is created in favour of the 
petitioner merely because his name was recommended for 
consideration for appointment against the post”. Further, it is later 
held in “NAZIR A. KHAN SWATI versus MINISTRY OF LAW & 
JUSTICE and others” (1998 PLC (C.S) 372) that “mere nomination 
of the petitioner for the appointment against the advertised post did 
not create any vested right in the petitioner”.  
13. 
It has already been held by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
“HADAYAT ULLAH and others versus FEDERATION OF 
PAKISTAN and others” 
(2022 SCMR 
1991) that 
“The 
appointments to the posts or services in any organ or 
instrumentality of the State (such as, corporations, organizations, 
or bodies established under law or controlled by Government) that 
do not fall within the 'service of Pakistan', as defined in Article 260 
of the Constitution, are covered under the wide import and 
amplitude of 'equality' guaranteed under Article 25 of the 
Constitution. Therefore, such appointments are also to be made by 
providing equal opportunity to all citizens by public advertisement 
and ensuring maximum transparency in the selection process to 
dispel any impression of favouritism and nepotism”. In peculiar 
circumstances of case in hand, relevant law/“Rules” themselves 
provide complete and exhaustive procedure for appointment in 
consideration and it is otherwise a settled principle of law that when 
a law describes or requires a thing to be done in a particular 
manner, it should be done in that manner or not at all.  
Reliance in said regard may well be placed upon observation  

W.P.No.3222 of 2021 
 
       9 
in “ATTAULLAH KHAN versus ALI AZAM AFRIDI and others” 
(2023 PLC (C.S) 182). 
14. 
In view of above discussion and law laid down in the 
judgments of superior Court, referred to above, it is unequivocal that 
mere recommendation or nomination for appointment does not create 
any vested right until it has been done through proper 
procedure/mechanism provided under the law which, admittedly in 
the case in hand, has not been adopted therefore, the instant petition 
has no merit which is accordingly dismissed.  
15. 
Before parting with the judgment, it is observed that the 
Respondent No.2 gave appointments to the Petitioners of his own 
without following the procedure provided under the “Rules” and the 
instructions issued from time to time by the competent authority, 
which otherwise were well within his knowledge, therefore the 
concerned department shall also initiate disciplinary action against the 
said Respondent in accordance with law.
