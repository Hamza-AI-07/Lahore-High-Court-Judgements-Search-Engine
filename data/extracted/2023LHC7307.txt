Criminal Appeal No.151 of 2019  assailing their convictions and

2019, the  Criminal Revision No. 148 of 2019  and the Murder 
Reference No.28 of 2019 through this single judgment.  
3. 
 Precisely the facts necessary, as stated by Zia Ahmed (PW-6), the 
complainant of the case, are as under:- 
“Stated that on 01.03.2018 at about 05:45 pm I and my brother 
Ishtiaque were going on our motorcycle Road Prince from 
Burewala to our house. When we reached near Chak No.291/E.B, 
the accused persons present in the court Zahid, Amin and Nadeem 
came on a motorcycle behind us. When they came in line with us 
accused persons namely Zahid and Nadeem pointed their pistols to 
us and asked us to stop. We stopped and deboarded from our 
motorcycle. The accused persons present in the court also 
deboarded from their motorcycle. They were having handkerchief 
on their faces which were put off. Zahid accused remained pointed 
his pistol and said if we moved he would kill us. Accused Amin 
searched me. I was having mobile phone Nokia of my brother in 
my hand. He snatched the same. I was having my mobile in my 
pocket. Amin accused present in the court snatched that mobile 
phone Nokia, copy of my ID card and Rs.50/- from me. Nadeem

Ishtiaque Ahmad. He also snatched Rs.4500/- and copyof I.D card 
from the pocket of my brother Ishtiaque Ahmad. Nadeem accused

hand over the key of Motorcycle to them, upon which accused 
Nadeem made fire shot of his pistol which hit on the left arm and 
went to left flank of my brother Ishtiaq. In the meanwhile, PWs 
Anees Ahmad, Ijaz and Munawar Hussain also reached at the place 
of occurrence and they witnessed the occurrence. The accused 
persons ran away towards Chak No. 291 while leaving their 
motorcycle united, at the spot. My brother fell at the edge of the 
metaled road and scrummed to the injuries at the spot. 
 
  
I left Anees Ahmad and Muhammad Ijaz near the dead 
body of my brother Ishtiaq and myself set out for police station. 
When I reached in the Chowk of Mana Moor on my way to police 
station, police party was standing there, I went to the police 
Thanedar was sitting inside the vehicle. I got recorded my 
statement Ex. PF which bears my signatures. I alongwith the police 
party reached again at the place of occurrence. 
 
  
On next day I was called by the 1.0 at the place of 
occurrence. I alongwith PWs reached there. On our pointation and 
direction of the 1.0 Patwari Halqa took the rough note for scaled 
site plan. 
 
  
On 03.03.2018 at the day of Rasm-e-Kul of my brother 
some persons informed us that the persons namely Zahid, Amin 
and Nadeem were the real culprits who used to commit such like 
occurrence in the area. I and eye witnesses nominated the accused 
persons present in the court, in this case in the police station. 
                On 16.03.2018 I and eye witnesses were summoned in 
the district jail Vehari for test identification parade. I identified the 
accused persons namely Zahid, Amin and Nadeem during the 
identification parade one by one. The accused persons present in 
the court are the real culprits who have committed the offence ” 
 
4. 
After the formal investigation of the case report under section 173 
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 was submitted before the 
learned trial court and the appellants namely Muhammad Nadeem son of 

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019

Neghaban and Muhammad Zahid alias Billa son of Muzammil along 
with their co-accused namely Muhammad Amin son of Naseer (since 
acquitted) were sent to face trial. The learned trial court framed the 
charge against the accused on 10.08.2018, to which the accused pleaded 
not guilty and claimed trial. 
 
5. 
The prosecution in order to prove its case got recorded statements 
of ten witnesses. Zia Ahmed (PW-6) and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7)  gave 
evidence regarding the ocular account. Aziz ur Rehman Patwari (PW-1) 
prepared the scaled site plan of the place of occurrence (Exh.PB). Tanvir 
Ahmad 1114/C (PW-2) stated that on 01.03.2018 he escorted the dead 
body of the deceased to the hospital and received the last worn clothes of 
the deceased from the Medical Officer after the post mortem 
examination of the dead body of the deceased. Muhammad Iqbal (PW-4) 
stated that on 01.03.2018, he identified the dead body of the deceased  at 
the time of its post mortem examination and the Medical Officer handed 
over the last worn clothes of the deceased to the police officer in his 
presence. Abbas Ali 1330/HC (PW-5) stated that on 01.03.2018, the 
Investigating Officer of the case handed over to him a sealed parcel said 
to contain an empty shell of the bullet and on 27.03.2018, the 
Investigating Officer of the case  handed over to him  a sealed parcel

over all the said sealed parcels to the Investigating Officer of the case on 
10.04.2018 for their onward transmission to the office of the Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency, Lahore. Muhammad Amjad (PW-8) stated 
that on 27.03.2018, the appellant namely Muhammad Nadeem got 
recovered pistol (P-8) along with seven live bullets (P-9/1-7) and on the 
same day the appellant namely Muhammad Zahid alias Billa got

got recovered pistol (P-13) along with four live bullets and also got 
recovered  two mobile phone devices (P-14 and P-15) on the same day. 
Muhammad Shafique learned Civil Judge/Magistrate (PW-9) stated that 
on 16.03.2018, he supervised the test identification parade proceedings 
held to establish the identities of the appellants and prepared his report 
(PW/9).  Naseer Ahmad 758/HC (PW-10) stated that on 01.03.2018, he 
got recorded the formal F.I.R (Exh.PF/1). Mahboob Elahi, SI 
investigated the case, however, remained untraceable during the trial, 
therefore, statement of Abbas Ali 1330/HC (PW-5) was recorded with 
regard to the documents prepared by Mahboob Elahi, SI (untraceable) 
who got exhibited all the documents as prepared by Mahboob Elahi, SI 
(untraceable) being conversant with his handwriting. 
 
6. 
The prosecution also got Dr.  Muhammad Naeem Tahir (PW-3)

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019

Gaggo and on the same day conducted  the postmortem examination of 
the dead body of Ishtiaque Ahmed  (deceased).  Dr.  Muhammad Naeem 
Tahir (PW-3) on examining the dead body of the deceased Ishtiaque

FINAL OPINION. 
 
After conducting the postmortem of Ishtiaque deceased I was of 
opinion that death occurred due to the injury to the abdomen and thorax 
leading to rupture of spleen and large and small intestines that led to 
hemorrhage and then Hypovolemic that ultimately led to cardio pulmonary 
arrest and death. The injury was anti mortem and due to firearm. I handed 
over the dead body of the deceased, last wom clothes PMR and police 
documents to Tanveer Ahmad 1114/C after conducting the postmortem of 
the deceased.”  
 
7. 
On 21.02.2019 the learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor  
gave up the prosecution witnesses namely Amin, Munawar Hussain and 
Allah Ditta as being unnecessary and closed the prosecution evidence 

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No. 151 of 2019 
Crl. Revision  No. 148 of 2019

after tendering the report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore 
(Exh.PZ) regarding blood stained earth and the report of Punjab Forensic 
Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PAA) regarding the comparison of the 
empty shell of the bullet and the pistols. 
 
8. 
After the closure of prosecution evidence, the learned trial court 
examined appellants namely Muhammad Nadeem son of Neghaban and 
Muhammad Zahid alias Billa son of Muzammil under section 342 
Cr.P.C. and in answer to question why this case against you and why the 
PWs have deposed against you, they replied that they were innocent and 
had been falsely involved in the case. They further stated that they had 
not committed the occurrence and had been made  scapegoats in the case 
in order to show efficiency by the police. The appellants namely 
Muhammad Nadeem son of Neghaban and Muhammad Zahid alias Billa 
son of Muzammil opted not to get themselves examined under section 
340(2) Cr.P.C however the appellant namely Muhammad Nadeem son of 
Neghaban produced the document (Exh.DF) as evidence in his defence.  
 
9. 
On the conclusion of the trial, the learned Additional Sessions 
Judge, Burewala convicted and sentenced the appellants as referred to 
above.   
 
10. 
The contention of the learned counsel for the appellants is that 
whole case is fabricated and false. The learned counsel for the appellants 
argued that the prosecution remained unable to prove the facts in issue 

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No. 151 of 2019 
Crl. Revision  No. 148 of 2019 
9 
 
and did not produce any unimpeachable, admissible and relevant 
evidence to prove the same. The learned counsel for the appellants 
further contended that the statements of Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  and Ijaz 
Ahmed (PW-7)  were not worthy of any reliance. He further contended 
that the appellants were neither nominated in the F.I.R  nor in the 
statements of witnesses recorded on the first day and the test 
identification parade proceedings as conducted were full of procedural 
defects and of no legal worth and value. The learned counsel for the 
appellants also argued that the recoveries were full of procedural defects, 
of no legal worth and value and result of fake proceedings. The learned 
counsel for the appellants finally submitted that the prosecution had 
totally failed to prove the case against the appellants beyond the shadow 
of a doubt.   
 
11. 
On the other hand, the learned District Public Prosecutor  and the 
learned counsel for the complainant contended that the prosecution had 
proved its case beyond a shadow of a doubt by producing independent 
witnesses. The learned District Public Prosecutor and the learned 
counsel for the complainant further argued that the deceased died as a 
result of injuries suffered at the hands of the appellants in a joint 
enterprise. The learned District Public Prosecutor and the learned 
counsel for the complainant further contended that the medical evidence 
also corroborated the statements of Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  and Ijaz Ahmed 
(PW-7) . The learned District Public Prosecutor and the learned counsel 
for the complainant further argued that the recoveries made during the 

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No. 151 of 2019 
Crl. Revision  No. 148 of 2019 
10 
 
investigation of the case corroborated the ocular account. The learned 
District Public Prosecutor and the learned counsel for the complainant 
further contended that there was no occasion for the prosecution 
witnesses, who were related to the deceased, to substitute the real 
offenders with the innocent in this case. Lastly, the learned District 
Public Prosecutor and the learned counsel for the complainant prayed for 
the rejection of the appeal. 
 
12. 
We have heard the learned counsel for the appellants, the learned 
District Public Prosecutor, the learned counsel for the complainant and 
with their assistance have perused the record and evidence recorded 
during the trial. 
 
13. 
The whole prosecution case revolves around the statements of Zia 
Ahmed (PW-6)  and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7) . These witnesses namely Zia 
Ahmed (PW-6)  and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7)  were related to each other as 
well as the deceased. Their relationship with the deceased is also on 
record.  The prosecution witness namely Ijaz Ahmad (PW-7) stated 
during cross-examination that he was related to the complainant of the 
case and admitted as under:- 
“Complainant Zia Ahmad is my relative” 
It is also a fact that the prosecution witnesses namely Zia Ahmed (PW-
6)  and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7) were not the residents of the place of 
occurrence . The prosecution witness namely Zia Ahmad (PW-6) gave 
his residence as that of Mauza Jhodika District Bahawalnagar , whereas 

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No. 151 of 2019 
Crl. Revision  No. 148 of 2019 
11 
 
the occurrence took place within the area of Chak No. 291/EB District 
Vehari. The other eye witness of the case namely Ijaz Ahmad (PW-7) 
stated during cross-examination that his residence was at a distance of 
12-15 kilometers from the place of occurrence. The prosecution witness 
namely Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7) during cross-examination admitted as 
under:- 
“The place of occurrence is at a distance of about 12/15 K.M from 
my house ” 
When it is an admitted aspect of the prosecution case that both the 
prosecution witnesses namely Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-
7)  had their residences or their places of business quite a distance from 
the place of occurrence, then both the witnesses can be validly termed as 
“chance witnesses”. The prosecution witnesses namely Zia Ahmed 
(PW-6)  and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7) claimed that on the day of occurrence 
they had gone to the city of Burewala and when they were returning 
from the said city, the occurrence took place on their arrival within the 
area of Chak No.291/EB .The perusal of the statements of the 
prosecution witnesses namely Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-
7) recorded during the course of the trial reveals that they could not 
prove their stated reasons for their visit to the city of Burewala and on 
return from the said city, their arrival within the area of Chak No.291/EB 
where the occurrence took place. The prosecution witness namely Ijaz 
Ahmed (PW-7)  candidly admitted during cross-examination  that  he 
provided no reason to the Investigating Officer of the case for his visit to 
the city of Burewala and  his subsequent return from the said city and his 

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No. 151 of 2019 
Crl. Revision  No. 148 of 2019 
12 
 
arrival at the place of occurrence. Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7) during cross-
examination stated as under:- 
“ On the day of occurrence I came to Burewala. I did not told (sic) the 
I.0 that for what purpose I came to Burewala”  
Similarly, the prosecution witness namely Zia Ahmad (PW-6) only 
stated that he was coming back from the city of Burewala to his own 
house when the occurrence took place, however, did not explain any 
reason available with him for having visited the city of Burewala on the 
day of the incident and that too with the deceased  when admittedly Zia 
Ahmad (PW-6) was the resident of Mauza Judhika District 
Bahawalnagar. Moreover, during the investigation of the case, no 
statement of any witness was recorded with whom the prosecution 
witnesses namely Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7)  had 
entered into any transaction on the day of occurrence which would have 
substantiated the claim of the prosecution witnesses namely Zia Ahmed 
(PW-6)  and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7) that on the day of occurrence, they had 
visited and were returning from the city of Burewala when the incident 
took place. We have also noted that the alleged eye witnesses namely 
Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7)  were not mentioned in 
column No.4 or page 4 of the inquest report (Exh.PD) as being the ones 
who were present at the time of preparation of the said inquest report 
(Exh. PD) by the investigating officer. These witnesses were also not the 
ones who had identified the dead body of the deceased at the time of the 
postmortem examination of the same. The dead body of the deceased 

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No. 151 of 2019 
Crl. Revision  No. 148 of 2019 
13 
 
was identified by Muhammad Iqbal (PW-4), who admitted during cross-
examination that he was not even related to the deceased. Muhammad 
Iqbal (PW-4)  during cross-examination stated as under:- 
“It is correct that I am not relative of deceased Ishtaique and inspite of 
this fact I identified the dead body ” 
Zia Ahmad (PW-6) admitted that he had not identified the dead body of 
the deceased at the time of post mortem examination rather Muhammad 
Iqbal (PW-4) did the same with whom he had no relationship. Zia 
Ahmad (PW-6) during cross-examination admitted as under:- 
“ It is correct that neither I, nor Ijaz and Anees PWs identified the 
dead body before the doctor at the time of autopsy. The person to 
meet whom we came Burewala namely Iqbal, identified the dead 
body of my brother at the time of autopsy. Iqbal is not my relative 
nor he is from my brother” (emphasis supplied)  
It has not been explained and is also implausible that when prosecution 
witnesses namely Zia Ahmed (PW-6) and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7) were 
ostensibly present at the place of occurrence at the time of arrival of the 
Investigating Officer of the case and the departure of the dead body to 
the RHC for the purpose of its post mortem examination then why it was 
found necessary to get the dead body identified by Muhammad Iqbal 
(PW-4) who was not even related to the deceased. The prosecution 
witnesses namely Zia Ahmed (PW-6) and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7) also 
admitted that they did not accompany the dead body of the deceased to 

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No. 151 of 2019 
Crl. Revision  No. 148 of 2019 
14 
 
the RHC when the same was taken from the place of incident. Zia 
Ahmad (PW-6) during cross-examination, admitted as under:- 
“It is correct I, Ijaz and Anees PWs did not accompany the dead 
body to the mortuary. It is incorrect to suggest that we were not 
present at the spot so we did not accompany the dead body to the 
mortuary. Munawar Hussain also did not accompany the dead body to 
the mortuary. ”(emphasis supplied)  
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has repeatedly observed that such 
conduct of the prosecution witnesses where they failed to accompany the 
dead body of the deceased to the hospital revealed their absence at the 
place of occurrence. Reliance is placed on the case of Muhammad 
Sharifan Bibi vs. Muhammad Yasin and others ( 2012 SCMR 82) 
wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan held as under:- 
“Their presence becomes further doubtful as none of them 
accompanied Abdul Latif deceased to the hospital for postmortem 
examination.” 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Zaheer Sadiq v. 
Muhammad Ijaz and others” (2017 SCMR 2007) has observed as under: 
“The conduct of both these witnesses is also highly improbable as 
they did not try to shift Muhammad Sadiq (deceased) or Muhammad 
Sadiq (injured) to the hospital prior to the arrival of the Police.” 
It is also an admitted part of the prosecution case that though the 
occurrence had taken place at about 05.45 p.m, however, according to 
Dr. Muhammad Naeem Tahir, (PW-3) , the dead body of the deceased 

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No. 151 of 2019 
Crl. Revision  No. 148 of 2019 
15 
 
was brought to the hospital at 11.00 p.m. Dr. Muhammad Naeem Tahir, 
(PW-3) stated during cross-examination , as under:- 
“1 received dead body of deceased Ishtiaque Ahmad at about 11:00 
p.m on 01.03.2018. According to post mortem report Ex. P-E I 
received the documents from police at about 11:30 p.m and I 
conducted postmortem examination on 11:40 p.m on the same day ” 
Even Zia Ahmad (PW-6) admitted that after the occurrence, the dead 
body remained at the place of occurrence for about 2/ 2 ½ hours. The 
delay in dispatching the dead body to the RHC is indicative of the fact 
that the said time was consumed to procure the attendance of prosecution 
witnesses namely Zia Ahmed (PW-6) and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7) from their 
houses. All these facts are conspicuous and telling of the fact that 
prosecution witnesses namely Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-
7) were not present at the place of occurrence at the time of occurrence 
and their attendance was procured subsequently.  In this respect  reliance 
is placed on the cases of Muhammad Rafiq v. State (2014 SCMR 1698), 
“Usman alias Kaloo v. State” (2017 SCMR 622) and Nasrullah alias 
Nasro v. The State (2017 SCMR 724) . 
14 
  It was indeed an unfortunate incident wherein, during robbery, 
Ishtiaque Ahmed (deceased) lost his life however, the fact remains that 
the names of the assailants were not mentioned in the  oral statement 
(Exh.PF)  as got recorded by Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  to Mahboob Elahi, SI 
(untraceable), the Investigating Officer of the case  and the formal F.I.R 
(Exh.PF/1) was lodged against unknown accused persons. The 

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No. 151 of 2019 
Crl. Revision  No. 148 of 2019 
16 
 
prosecution, in order to prove the identities of the appellants as being the 
accused involved in the occurrence, got  Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  and Ijaz 
Ahmed (PW-7) examined, who both stated that on 16.03.2018   they had 
identified the appellants during the test identification parade proceedings 
held to establish the identities of the appellants. Facts which establish the 
identity of any person whose identity is relevant are, by virtue of Article 
22 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat,1984, always relevant. The term 
'identification' means proving that a person before the Court is the very 
same that he is alleged, charged or reputed to be. Identification is almost 
always a matter of opinion or belief. With regard to a criminal offence, 
identification has a two-fold object: first, to satisfy the investigating 
authorities, before sending a case for trial to court, that the person 
arrested, but not previously known to the witnesses, was the one of those 
who committed the crime,; second, to satisfy the court that the accused 
was the real offender concerned with the crime. Identification 
proceedings are therefore as much in the interest of the prosecution as in 
the interest of the accused. An identification parade is held in the course 
of investigation of an offence for the purpose of enabling the witnesses 
to identify the persons who are concerned with the offence; they are not 
held merely for the purpose of identifying persons irrespective of their 
connection with the offence; the witnesses are explained the purpose of 
holding these parades and are asked to identify the persons who are 
concerned in the offence. But it is obvious that if before the court a 
witness pointed to a stranger and stated that he was the offender, there 
would be no guarantee of the truth of his assertion. Consequently, in 

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No. 151 of 2019 
Crl. Revision  No. 148 of 2019 
17 
 
order to have some assurance of truth, a test identification is held , that is 
to say, the witness at an earlier stage is confronted with the alleged 
offender, not standing alone but mixed with a number of innocent 
persons of the same age-group and of similar build and features. That is 
to say, it is to give credence to the evidence of a witness who does not 
know the accused from before, subsequent to the commission of the 
offence, that a test identification is held, since, without it, the evidence 
of the witness concerned would have little value. Of course, the 
substantive evidence, i.e., evidence on which alone the court can base its 
order of conviction or acquittal, is that given by the witness before the 
court, but the value of deposition of a witness of having identified the 
accused in the act of the crime is of little consequence. Before the Court 
can accept such identification as sufficient to establish the identity of the 
accused, it is very necessary that there be reliable corroborative 
evidence, and the corroborative evidence which the Court is entitled to 
accept in such cases is that of a test identification parade conducted with 
due precautions. In short, a test identification is designed to furnish 
evidence to corroborate the evidence which the witness concerned 
tenders before the court. But of all evidence of fact, evidence about the 
identification of a stranger is perhaps the most elusive, and the Courts 
are generally agreed that the evidence of identification of a stranger 
based on a personal impression, even if the veracity of the witness is 
above board, should be approached with considerable caution, because a 
variety of conditions must be fulfilled before evidence based on the 
impression can become worthy of credence.  As mentioned above, the 

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No. 151 of 2019 
Crl. Revision  No. 148 of 2019 
18 
 
names of the assailants were not mentioned in the oral statement  
(Exh.PF) of  Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  and the F.I.R (Exh.PF/1) was lodged 
against unknown accused persons. Subsequently, both the witnesses 
namely Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  and  Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7)  got recorded their 
statements under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 
on 03.03.2018, wherein they not only named the appellants as accused 
who had committed the occurrence but also gave all the details with 
regard to their particulars.  Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  in his statement recorded 
by the learned trial court , stated as under:- 
“On 03.03.2018 at the day of Rasm-e-Kul of my brother some 
persons informed us that the persons namely Zahid, Amin and 
Nadeem were the real culprits who used to commit such like 
occurrence in the area. I and eye witnesses nominated the 
accused persons present in the court, in this case in the police 
station. 
………………………….. 
I disclosed the names, parentages, castes and addresses of the 
accused persons to the I.0 on 03.03.2018” 
The prosecution witness namely Zia Ahmad (PW-6) even claimed that 
he had named the appellants in his oral statement (Exh.PF) and during 
cross-examination claimed as under:- 
“I got recorded in my statement Ex. PF that "my brother Ishtiaq did 
not hand over the key of motorcycle to them upon which accused 
Nadeem made fire shot of his pistol which hit on the left arm and 
went to left flank of my brother Ishtiaq ”(emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7)  in his statement 
recorded by the learned trial court , stated as under:- 

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No. 151 of 2019 
Crl. Revision  No. 148 of 2019 
19 
 
“On 03.03.2018, we nominated these persons in this case in the 
police station. 
……… 
On 03.03.2018 I alongwith complainant Zia Ahmad and 
Muhammad Anees PW appeared before the I.O. We 
nominated the accused persons in this case on 03.03.2018 
while mentioning their names, parentages, castes and 
addresses. 
………….. 
When I identified accused Nadeem I told his name to 
learned Magistrate. It is incorrect to suggest that I did not tell 
the name accused Nadeem to learned Magistrate. When I 
identified accused Zahid I told his name to learned 
Magistrate.” (emphasis supplied)  
The above referred portion of the statements of the prosecution 
witnesses clearly reflects that the identities and the particulars of the 
appellants were in the knowledge of Zia Ahmed (PW-6) and Ijaz Ahmed 
(PW-7) , therefore, there did not exist any reason for the said witnesses 
not to have named the appellants as accused on the day when the F.I.R 
was being registered. Moreover, when every detail regarding the 
assailants was disclosed by Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7)  
through their statements recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C. on 
03.03.2018 then the holding of the test identification parade proceedings  
even otherwise was an exercise in futility. The question begs an answer 
that when Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7)  both knew about 
the details and particulars of the accused and when the prosecution 
witnesses namely Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7)  had 
already got the appellants named as accused on 03.03.2018, then for 

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No. 151 of 2019 
Crl. Revision  No. 148 of 2019 
20 
 
what purpose the test identification parade proceedings were held on 
16.03.2018. We have also noted that the arrest of the appellants was 
affected after the witnesses namely Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  and Ijaz Ahmed 
(PW-7)  had got recorded their statements recorded under section 161 
Cr.P.C. on 03.03.2018. The description of the appellants was so vivid 
and detailed that out of the whole province of Punjab, the appellants 
were identified and arrested by Mahboob Elahi, SI (untraceable), the 
Investigating Officer of the case . This illustrates the futility of holding 
of the test identification parade proceedings to establish the identities of 
the appellants who were so clearly named and already identified by the 
witnesses  namely Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7)  prior to 
the said test identification parade proceedings held on 16.03.2018. 
15.  Another aspect drawing our grave concern is the fact that the 
prosecution witnesses namely Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-
7)   made blatant improvements to their previous statements in order to 
bring the ocular account as narrated by them in line with the 
observations of ).  Dr.  Muhammad Naeem Tahir (PW-3) who had 
conducted the post mortem examination of the dead body of the 
deceased namely Ishtiaque Ahmed , and went on to claim that during the 
occurrence only one accused fired at the deceased and the deceased also 
suffered from one firearm entry wound on his body though initially the 
prosecution witnesses namely Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-
7)  had stated that two of the assailants had fired at the deceased , hitting 
him separately. The prosecution witnesses namely Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No. 151 of 2019 
Crl. Revision  No. 148 of 2019 
21 
 
and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7) made a deliberate and dishonest departure from 
their earlier narrations of the occurrence while deposing before the 
learned trial court. The prosecution witness namely Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  
was cross-examined in this regard and the learned trial court observed as 
under:- 
“I did not get record (sic) in my statement Ex. PF that one accused 
made fire short of pistol 30-Bore, which hit at the left arm of my 
brother Ishtiaq whereas the other accused made fire with pistol 30 
Bore, which hit at the left flank of my brother Ishtiaque Ahmad. 
Confronted with Ex. PF where it is so recorded(emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7) was also cross-
examined in this regard and the learned trial court observed as under:- 
“I did not get record (sic) in my statement before police that one 
person made a fire shot with pistol 30 bore which hit at the arm of 
Ishtiaque Ahmad deceased where as the second person made fire 
shot with pistol 30 bore which hit at the left flank of Ishtiaque. 
Confronted with Ex. D-B where it is so recorded.`(emphasis 
supplied) 
By improving their previous statements , the prosecution witnesses 
namely Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7)  impeached their 
own credit. Article 151 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984 provides as 
under: - 
“151. Impeaching credit of witness. The credit of a witness may 
be impeached in the following ways by the adverse party, or, 
with the consent of the Court, by the party who calls him: 

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No. 151 of 2019 
Crl. Revision  No. 148 of 2019 
22 
 
(1) by the evidence of persons who testify that they, from their 
knowledge of the witness, believe him to be un worthy of credit; 
(2) by proof that the witness has been bribed, or has accepted 
the offer of a bribe, or has received any other corrupt 
inducement to give his evidence; 
(3) by proof of former statements inconsistent with any part 
of his evidence which is liable to be contradicted ;” 
As the prosecution witnesses namely Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  and Ijaz 
Ahmed 
(PW-7) 
introduced 
dishonest, 
blatant 
and 
substantial 
improvements to their previous statements and were duly confronted 
with their former statements, hence their credit stands impeached and the 
prosecution witnesses namely Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-
7)   cannot be relied upon, being proved to have deposed with a slight, 
intended to mislead the court. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
the case of “Muhammad Ashraf Vs. State” (2012 SCMR 419) took 
serious notice of the improvements introduced by witnesses and rejected 
their evidence. We, thus, are satisfied that the evidence of the 
prosecution witnesses namely Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-
7)   has no intrinsic worth and is to be rejected outrightly. The august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in a recent case reported as “Muhammad 
Mansha Vs. The State” (2018 SCMR 772) has enunciated the following 
principle: 
 “Once the Court comes to the conclusion that the eye witnesses 
had made dishonest improvements in their statements then it is 
not safe to place reliance on their statements. It is also settled 
by this Court that whenever a witness made dishonest 
improvement in his version in order to bring his case in line 
with the medical evidence or in order to strengthen the 
prosecution case then his testimony is not worthy of credence”. 

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No. 151 of 2019 
Crl. Revision  No. 148 of 2019 
23 
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case reported as 
Muhammad Arif Vs. The State (2019 SCMR 631) has enunciated the 
following principle: 
 “It is well established by now that when a witness improves his 
statement and moment it is observed that the said improvement 
was made dishonestly to strengthen the prosecution, such 
portion of his statement is to be discarded out of consideration. 
Having observed the improvements in the statements of both the 
witnesses of ocular account, we hold that it is not safe to rely on 
their testimony to maintain conviction and sentence of 
Muhammad Arif (appellant) on a capital charge.”  
Guidance is sought from the principle enunciated by the august Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in the case of “Amin Ali and another Vs. The State” 
(2011 SCMR 323) where the august Supreme Court of Pakistan was 
pleased to reject the evidence of injured witnesses and held as under:-  
“11. All the three witnesses deposed that the deceased had 
received three injuries, but the Medical Officer found six injuries 
on the person of the deceased. One of them had blackening. None 
of the witnesses deposed that any of the appellants had caused 
the injuries from a close range but on the contrary in the site 
plan the place of firing has been shown 8 feet away from the 
deceased. Thus from such a distance injury with blackening 
cannot be caused as it can be caused from a distance of less than 
3 feet as per Modi's Medical Jurisprudence. The Medical Officer 
did not show as to which of the injury was entry or exit wound on 
the person of the deceased. The medical officer stated that 
metalic projectile was recovered from wound No.1/B which was 
an exit wound. If it was an exit wound then the metalic projectile 
would have been out of the body. The presence of metalic 
projectile in the body clearly establishes the fact that it is not an 
exit wound but an entry wound. The medical officer has not 
shown that any of the injuries had inverted or averted margins so 
as to ascertain as to which of the injuries is entry or exit wound. 
Thus on this count there is a conflict between the medical and 
oral evidence. Furthermore, according to Medical Officer, the 
P.W.15 had four injuries out of them two were entry and two 
were exit wounds but the P.Ws. 13 and 14 deposed that the 
injured had received three injuries. Thus the P.Ws. have shown 
one exit wound as entry wound. With regard to the injured 
Tanveer Hussain, the Medical Officer showed two injuries one 
entry wound on the chest and one exit wound on the back but all 
the three eye-witnesses deposed that P.W.14 had received two 
injuries on his chest. As regards injuries on the person of Mst. 
Maqbool Bibi. The Medical Officer found one entry wound on 
her back with blackening, whereas P.Ws. 13, 14 and 15 deposed 

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No. 151 of 2019 
Crl. Revision  No. 148 of 2019 
24 
 
that the fire shot was fired from the roof of the shop. Entry wound 
with blackening marks cannot be caused from such a long 
distance. From the above position it is manifest that the ocular 
testimony is in conflict with the medical evidence. Thus, the 
deceased and injured did not receive the injuries in the manner, 
as alleged by the prosecution. 
………………………………. 
13. From the above evidence of the P. Ws., they do not appear to 
be truthful witnesses; therefore, no implicit reliance can be 
placed on their evidence.” 
16.     The learned District Public Prosecutor and the learned counsel for 
the complainant have laid much stress on the fact that the appellants 
were identified by the witnesses during test identification parade 
proceedings. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Mian 
SOHAIL AHMED and others Vs. The State and others (2019 SCMR 
956) has enunciated guiding principles for the appreciation of evidence 
regarding the test identification parade and the statements of the 
witnesses participating in the same. The august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the case of Mian SOHAIL AHMED and others Vs. The State 
and others (2019 SCMR 956) has held as under:- 
“13. 
In the late 1960s, the courts around the world12, began to 
set the standard for reviewing eyewitness identification 
evidence.13 Reliability and credibility of the witness was termed 
as the linchpin in determining the admissibility of identification 
testimony.14 US Supreme Court in the case of Manson v 
Brathwaite15, UK Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) in Regina 
v. Turnbull and Another,16 New Jersey Supreme Court in State v 
Madison17 and Oregon Supreme Court in State v. Classen18 
settled the following factors for assessing the reliability of the 
witness: 
(1) 
the opportunity of the witness to view the suspect at the 
time of the crime; 
(2) 
the witness's degree of attention; 
(3) 
the accuracy of the witness's prior description of the 
suspect; 

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No. 151 of 2019 
Crl. Revision  No. 148 of 2019 
25 
 
(4) 
the level of certainty demonstrated at the confrontation 
(seeing the accused in court); and 
(5) 
the time between the crime and the confrontation (seeing 
the accused in court). 
It is interesting to note that these factors were drawn from 
earlier judicial rulings and not from scientific research.19 The 
scientific research refutes the notion that memory is like a video 
recording, and that a witness needs only to replay the tape to 
remember what happened. Human memory is far more complex. 
The memory is a constructive, dynamic, and selective process. 
The process of remembering consists of three stages: 
acquisition-"the perception of the original event"; retention-"the 
period of time that passes between the event and the eventual 
recollection of a particular piece of information"; and retrieval-
the "stage during which a person recalls stored information".20 
The process of memory retention and retrieval may be affected 
by a number of factors. The scientific literature divides those 
variables into two categories: system and estimator variables.21 
System variables are factors like lineup procedures which are 
within the control of the criminal justice system and in our 
jurisprudence are referred to as the Test Identification Parade. 
Whereas Estimator variables are factors related to the witness - 
like distance, lighting, or stress - over which the legal system has 
no control.22 Our courts have marginally attended to this aspect 
of witness reliability before placing reliance on the identification 
evidence (see above). The scientific research23 establishes that 
the following non-exhaustive list of "estimator variables" 
negatively affect the memory process:- 
i. 
Stress: Even under the best viewing conditions, high 
levels of stress can diminish an eye-witness' ability to recall and 
make an accurate identification. It may be noted "while moderate 
levels of stress improve cognitive processing and might improve 
accuracy, an eye-witness under high stress is less likely to make 
a reliable identification of the perpetrator."24 
ii. 
Weapon Focus: When a visible weapon is used during a 
crime, it can distract a witness and draw his or her attention 
away from the culprit. "Weapon focus" can thus impair a 
witness' ability to make a reliable identification and describe 
what the culprit looks like if the crime is of short duration.25 
iii. 
Duration: The amount of time an eye-witness has to 
observe an event may affect the reliability of an identification. 
There is no minimum time required to make an accurate 
identification, however, a brief or fleeting contact is less likely to 
produce an accurate identification than a more prolonged 
exposure." 
iv. 
Distance and Lighting: A person is easier to recognize 
when close by, and that clarity decreases with distance. We also 
know that poor lighting makes it harder to see well. Thus, 
greater distance between a witness and a perpetrator and poor 
lighting conditions can diminish the reliability of an 
identification. 

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No. 151 of 2019 
Crl. Revision  No. 148 of 2019 
26 
 
v. 
Witness Characteristics: Characteristics like a witness' 
age and level of intoxication can affect the reliability of an 
identification. Children between the ages of nine and thirteen 
who view target-absent lineups are more likely to make incorrect 
identifications than adults8 
vi. 
Characteristics of Perpetrator: Disguises and changes in 
facial features altered between the time of the event and the 
identification procedure affects the accuracy of an identification. 
vii. 
Memory Decay: Memories fade with time and memory 
decay "is irreversible"; memories never improve. As a result, 
delays between the commission of a crime and the time an 
identification is made can affect reliability.30 
The scientific research referred to above has not only appeared 
in the peer reviewed journals but also has been considered 
"credible" by various courts in different jurisdictions. New 
Jersey Supreme Court in State v. Henderson32 observed that 
"virtually all of the scientific evidence" that had emerged in 
recent decades "reveals that an array of variables can affect and 
dilute memory and lead to misidentifications." Also see State v. 
Lawson33. 
14. 
The laws of evidence maintain that in order for the court 
to take judicial notice of scientific facts they must be part of the 
general knowledge of men or must be agreed upon by reputable 
men in a particular field of science beyond reasonable dispute.34 
For judges to determine the degree of consensus on a particular 
scientific fact they may refer to any reputable and recognized 
reference sources.35 The House of Lords in Regina (Quintavalle) 
v. Secretary of State for Health36 held that the laws have to be 
construed in the light of contemporary scientific knowledge and 
in order to give effect to a plain parliamentary purpose, the 
statute may be held to cover a scientific development not known 
when the statute was passed. This Court can take judicial notice 
of the credible scientific development under Article 112, Qanun-
e-Shahadat, 1984. The question is can we shut our eyes to 
credible scientific research and development, which has already 
been recognized and acknowledged by the courts in various 
other jurisdictions. If scientific research can help and assist the 
court in understanding and appreciating evidence more fully and 
more meaningfully, the risk of miscarriage of justice stands 
minimized. Therefore, the courts don't shy away from scientific 
developments but instead reach out and embrace them. Reliance 
on scientific research and the factors evolved by science to 
assess the reliability and credibility of the eye-witness can 
improve the quality of identification evidence and as a 
consequence the quality of justice. Our jurisprudence had 
already travelled in this direction and now credible scientific 
research by providing us additional factors or "estimator 
variables" (which are not exhaustive) has provided additional 
factors to certify the credibility and reliability of the eye-witness 
and as a result the veracity and probative value of the 
identification evidence.”

We have scrutinized the statements of the prosecution witnesses namely 
Zia Ahmed (PW-6) and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7) who appeared before the 
learned trial court and had joined the test identification parade 
proceedings held to establish the identity of the assailants, in light of the 
said judgment. Judges hearing a case should be aware of the dangers 
inherent in the identification of strangers by witnesses who have seen 
them very briefly. A perusal of the statements of both the prosecution 
witnesses namely Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7)  recorded 
by the learned trial court revealed that both the prosecution witnesses 
namely Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7) were confronted 
with their previous statements wherein they had stated that the faces of 
the assailants were covered by handkerchiefs and in that scenario there 
did not exist any ability with the prosecution witnesses namely Zia 
Ahmed (PW-6)  and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7) that they could have identified 
the assailants subsequently, therefore, they improved upon their previous 
statements and came up with the statements that during the occurrence, 
the handkerchiefs covering the faces of the assailants were removed 
however were duly confronted with their previous statements and were 
found to had made dishonest and blatant improvements in this regard . 
The prosecution witness namely Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  was cross-
examined in this regard and the learned trial court observed as under:- 
“I got recorded in my examination in chief that the handkerchiefs 
were put off. I got recorded this fact in my statement Ex. PF. 
Confronted with Ex. PF where it is not so recorded.  

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No. 151 of 2019 
Crl. Revision  No. 148 of 2019 
28 
 
………. 
I did not get record (sic)  before the Magistrate that the faces of the 
accused persons were covered with handkerchiefs which later on were 
put off.”(emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7) was also cross-
examined in this regard and the learned trial court observed as under:- 
“I did not get record (sic)  in my statement that the accused persons 
had muffled their faces with handkerchief. Confronted with Ex. D-B 
where it is so recorded.” 
We have also considered the fact that the prosecution witnesses namely 
Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7) obviously must have been 
under a lot of stress and even under the best viewing conditions, high 
levels of stress can diminish an eye-witness's ability to recall and make 
an accurate identification and an eye-witness under high stress is less 
likely to make a reliable identification of the perpetrator. Then the 
assailants had used a visible firearm weapon during the occurrence and 
the “estimator variables” of Weapon Focus and Stress were there, which 
distract a witness and draws his attention away from the culprit, 
impairing his ability to make a reliable identification and describe what 
the culprit looked like, in the situation, as in this case, that the incident 
was of short duration. Characteristics of Perpetrators ,as mentioned 
above ,could also not have been noted by prosecution witnesses namely 
Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7) as according to the 
prosecution witnesses namely Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-
7) themselves the assailants had taken measures to hide their identities .

Crl. Appeal No. 151 of 2019 
Crl. Revision  No. 148 of 2019 
29 
 
In view of the above discussion, it is proved on record that in the present 
case, many estimator variables existed which negatively affected the 
memory process making it impossible for the witnesses to have 
identified the accused during the test identification parade proceedings. 
17.  
 The learned District Public Prosecutor and the learned counsel for 
the complainant, have submitted that the recovery of the Pistol (P-8) 
from the appellant namely Muhammad Nadeem and the recovery of the 
Pistol (P-13) from the appellant namely Muhammad Zahid alias Billa 
offered sufficient corroboration of the statements of the prosecution 
witnesses namely Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7). 
Regarding the recovery of the Pistol (P-8) from the appellant namely 
Muhammad Nadeem and the recovery of the Pistol (P-13) from the 
appellant namely Muhammad Zahid alias Billa, the same cannot be 
relied upon as the Investigating Officer of the case, did not join any 
witness of the locality during the recovery of the Pistol (P-8) from the 
appellant namely Muhammad Nadeem  and the recovery of the Pistol 
(P-13) from the appellant namely Muhammad Zahid alias Billa which 
was in clear violation of section 103 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. 
Abbas Ali 1330/HC (PW-5), admitted during cross-examination , as 
under:- 
“it is correct that according to the record no independent 
private persons join the recovery proceedings in this case.  
………. 

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No. 151 of 2019

30 
 
Similarly, on 01.04.2018 & 02.04.2018 no witness from 
general public except Allah Ditta and Muhammad Amjad 
appeared before the I.0.” 
The provisions of section 103 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, 
unfortunately, are honoured more in disuse than compliance. To 
appreciate it better, this section is being reproduced:- 
"103.--(1) Before making a search under this chapter, the 
officer or other person about to make it shall call upon two 
or more respectable inhabitants of the locality in which 
the place to be searched is situate to attend and witness 
the search and may issue an order in writing to them or 
any of them so to do.” 
 
Therefore, the evidence of the recovery of the Pistol (P-8) from the 
appellant namely Muhammad Nadeem  and the recovery of the Pistol 
(P-13) from the appellant namely Muhammad Zahid alias Billa cannot 
be used as incriminating evidence against the appellants, being evidence 
that was obtained through illegal means and hence hit by the 
exclusionary rule of evidence The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
the case of Muhammad Ismail and others Vs. The State ( 2017 SCMR 
898) at page 901 has held as under:- 
“For the above mentioned recovery of weapons the prosecution had 
failed to associate any independent witness of the locality and, thus, 
the mandatory provisions of section 103, Cr.P.C. had flagrantly been 
violated in that regard.”  
Furthermore, on the perusal of the report of Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore (Exh. PAA) regarding the analysis of the Pistol (P-8) 
recovered from the appellant namely Muhammad Nadeem and the Pistol 
(P-13) recovered from the appellant namely Muhammad Zahid alias 

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019

Billa and the empty shell of the bullet collected from the place of 
occurrence, we have noticed that the empty shell of the bullet recovered 
from the place of occurrence and the Pistol (P-8) recovered from the 
appellant namely Muhammad Nadeem and the Pistol (P-13) recovered 
from the appellant namely Muhammad Zahid alias Billa were received 
by Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore on the same day i.e. 
11.04.2018. In this manner the said report of Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore. (Exh. PAA) has no evidentiary value as the possibility 
of fabricating matching empties is apparent. The august Supreme Court 
of Pakistan has held in the case of Nasrullah alias Nasro v. The State 
(2017 SCMR 724) as under :- 
“The alleged recovery of a pistol from the appellant's 
possession during the investigation was legally inconsequential 
because the report of the Forensic Science Laboratory brought 
on the record shows that the recovered pistol and the secured 
crime-empties had been received by the Forensic Science 
Laboratory together on one and the same day.” 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in the case of Nasrullah 
alias Ali Sher v. The State (2008 SCMR 707) as under :- 
“The crime-empties having been allegedly found at the place of 
occurrence and having been retained for so long the police 
station and having been sent to the F.S.L. along with the crime 
weapons and that also 12 days after the alleged weapons of 
offence had been allegedly recovered destroys and evidentiary 
value of the said piece of evidence. These recoveries, therefore, 
cannot offer any corroboration to the ocular testimony.” 
Moreover, the appellants namely Muhammad Nadeem and Muhammad 
Zahid alias Billa were arrested on 06.03.2018, the Pistol (P-8) from the 
appellant namely Muhammad Nadeem was recovered on 27.03.2018  
and the Pistol (P-13)  was recovered from the appellant namely 
Muhammad Zahid alias Billa on  02.04.2018 , however, the empty shell 

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No. 151 of 2019 
Crl. Revision  No. 148 of 2019 
32 
 
of the bullet taken into possession from the place of occurrence, was 
sent to Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore on 10.04.2018 .There 
was no reason for keeping the empty shell of the bullet which was taken 
into possession on 01.03.2018  at the Police Station and not sending 
them to the office of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore till 
10.04.2018, till after the arrest of the appellants and the recoveries of 
the pistols (P-8 and P-13). In this manner also the said report of Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency, Lahore. (Exh. PAA) has no evidentiary value 
as the possibility of fabrication is apparent. Reliance is placed on the 
case of Muhammad Amin Vs. The State and another (2019 S C M R 
2057) wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held as under:- 
“Interestingly, two empty cartridges (P-4/1-2) were 
secured from the place of occurrence by the investigating 
officer Akhtar Ali, SI (PW12) on the night of 11.10.2012, 
but the same were sent to the office of Punjab Forensic 
Science Agency on 23.01.2013 i.e. after arrest of the 
appellant in this case. In these circumstances, the positive 
report of FSL is of no avail to the prosecution and is 
inconsequential.” 
Therefore, the recovery of the Pistol (P-8) from the appellant namely 
Muhammad Nadeem and the recovery of the Pistol (P-13) from the 
appellant namely Muhammad Zahid alias Billa do not further the case of 
the prosecution in any manner. In view of the above mentioned facts, the 
recovery of the Pistol (P-8) from the appellant namely Muhammad 
Nadeem and the recovery of the Pistol (P-13) from the appellant namely 
Muhammad Zahid alias Billa are not proved and the same cannot be 
used as a circumstance against the appellants.

18. 
 The learned District Public Prosecutor  and the learned counsel 
for the complainant have also relied upon the recoveries from the 
appellant namely Muhammad Nadeem of the ring (P-12), a copy of 
CNIC (P-18) on 01.04.2018 and the recovery of Rs.4500/- (P-7/1-5) and 
a copy of CNIC of the deceased (P-17) on 27.03.2018 from the appellant 
namely Muhammad Zahid alias Billa and the recovery of two mobile 
phone devices (P-14 and P-15) also from the appellant namely 
Muhammad Zahid alias Billa on 02.04.2018 and have submitted that the 
said recoveries from the appellants offered sufficient corroboration of 
the ocular account of the occurrence as furnished by the prosecution 
witnesses namely Zia Ahmed (PW-6)  and Ijaz Ahmed (PW-7). With 
regard to the recovery of  the  of two mobile phone devices (P-14 and P-
15) also from the appellant namely Muhammad Zahid alias Billa on 
02.04.2018 ,it has been noted by us that the prosecution  failed to prove 
as to how  the said recovered mobile phone devices were proof of any 
fact in issue. The mobile phone devices  (P-14 and P-15) were never sent 
to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore for their analysis. Only 
the Forensic Analyst could have determined if the mobile phone devices  
(P-14 and P-15) having the International Mobile Equipment Identity 
(IMEI) were registered in the name of either the deceased or any of the 
witnesses.It is also a fact that Mahboob Elahi, SI (untraceable), 
Investigating Officer of the case  did not hand over the said mobile 
phone devices  (P-14 and P-15) to Abbas Ali 1330/HC (PW-5) and 
Abbas Ali 1330/HC (PW-5) did not make any statement of having 
received any such mobile phone devices  (P-14 and P-15) from the 

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No. 151 of 2019 
Crl. Revision  No. 148 of 2019 
34 
 
Investigating Officer of the case for keeping them in safe custody. 
Similarly, after the recoveries from the appellant namely Muhammad 
Nadeem of the ring (P-12) and a copy of CNIC (P-18) on 01.04.2018 
and the recovery of Rs.4500/- (P-7/1-5) and a copy of CNIC of the 
deceased (P-17) on 27.03.2018 from the appellant namely Muhammad 
Zahid alias Billa, Mahboob Elahi, SI (untraceable),Investigating Officer 
of the case did not hand over the said articles to Abbas Ali 1330/HC 
(PW-5) for keeping them in safe custody. It is also a fact of the 
prosecution case that during the recording of the statement of the 
prosecution witness namely Abbas Ali 1330/HC (PW-5), he was cross-
examined by the learned Assistant District Public Prosecutor , however, 
even during the said cross-examination it was not even suggested to 
Abbas 
Ali 
1330/HC 
(PW-5) 
that 
Mahboob 
Elahi, 
SI 
(untraceable),Investigating Officer of the case had handed over to him 
the ring (P-12) and a copy of CNIC (P-18) on 01.04.2018 and the 
Rs.4500/- (P-7/1-5) and a copy of CNIC of the deceased (P-17) on 
27.03.2018 for keeping them in safe custody. This fact alone is sufficient 
to reject the evidence of the prosecution with regard to the alleged 
recoveries of the ring (P-12) and a copy of CNIC (P-18) on 01.04.2018 
and the Rs.4500/- (P-7/1-5) and a copy of CNIC of the deceased (P-17) 
on 27.03.2018 from the appellants. Furthermore, it is admitted part of the 
prosecution case that Mahboob Elahi, SI (untraceable),Investigating 
Officer of the case, had visited the house of the appellant namely 
Muhammad Nadeem on 27.03.2018 and remained there for a substantial 
period of time and in that scenario, had the ring (P-12) and a copy of 

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No. 151 of 2019 
Crl. Revision  No. 148 of 2019 
35 
 
CNIC (P-18) been present in the same house, then their presence must 
have been noted by Mahboob Elahi, SI (untraceable), Investigating 
Officer of the case, however it was not.Similarly, it is an admitted part of 
the prosecution case that Mahboob Elahi, SI (untraceable), Investigating 
Officer of the case, had visited the house of the appellant namely 
Muhammad Zahid alias Billa on 27.03.2018 and remained there for a 
substantial period of time and in that scenario, had the pistol (P-13) and 
two mobile phone devices (P-14 and P-15) been present in the same 
house, then their presence must have been noted by Mahboob Elahi, SI 
(untraceable), Investigating Officer of the case, however, it was not. This 
also denudes the effort made by Mahboob Elahi, SI (untraceable), 
Investigating Officer of the case to prop up the failing prosecution case 
by showing false recoveries. Additionally, the prosecution witness 
namely Zia Ahmad (PW-6) admitted during cross-examination that he 
did not identify the ring (P-12) and the mobile phone devices (P-14 and 
P-15) as belonging to him or the deceased on the days (01.04.2018 and 
02.04.2018 respectively) when they were recovered and only identified 
them after having received them on temporary custody, whereas it was 
the claim of the prosecution witnesses that the said articles had been 
identified on the days when they were recovered and memos were also 
prepared regarding the said identification. Zia Ahmad (PW-6) during 
cross-examination, stated as under:- 
“ I did not identify the ring Ex. P-12 before the I.O. Witness 
volunteers I identified it when the same was taken by us on superdari. 
I do not remember after how many days of recovery, I took the gold 

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No. 151 of 2019 
Crl. Revision  No. 148 of 2019 
36 
 
ring Ex. P-12 on superdari. It is incorrect to suggest that I identified 
the gold ring Ex. P-12 on 01.04.2018 before the I.0. I did not identify 
the mobile phones Ex. P-14 and Ex. P-15 before the I.0. Witness 
volunteers identify the same after superdari” 
All these facts prove that sham proceedings were held to show recovery 
of the snatched property. 
 
19.       The only other piece of evidence left to be considered by us is the 
medical evidence but the same is of no assistance in this case as medical 
evidence by its nature and character, cannot recognize a culprit in case of 
an unobserved incidence. As all the other pieces of evidence relied upon 
by the prosecution in this case have been disbelieved and discarded by 
us, therefore, the appellants’ conviction cannot be upheld on the basis of 
medical evidence alone. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in its 
binding judgment titled “Hashim Qasim and another Vs. The State” 
(2017 SCMR 986) has enunciated the following principle of law:  
“The medical evidence is only confirmatory or of supporting 
nature and is never held to be corroboratory evidence, to identify 
the culprit.”   
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in its binding judgment titled 
“Naveed Asghar and two others Vs. The State” (P L D 2021 Supreme 
Court 600) has enunciated the following principle of law:  
“31. 
The prosecution has attempted to complete the chain of 
circumstantial evidence by medical evidence relating to the post 
mortem examinations of the deceased persons. This evidence 
proves only the factum that death of the deceased persons was 
caused by cutting their throats through some sharp edge weapon; 
it does in no way indicate who had cut their throats and with 
what particular weapon. Medical evidence is in the nature of 

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No. 151 of 2019 
Crl. Revision  No. 148 of 2019 
37 
 
supporting, confirmatory or explanatory of the direct or 
circumstantial evidence, and is not "corroborative evidence" in 
the sense the term is used in legal parlance for a piece of 
evidence that itself also has some probative force to connect the 
accused person with the commission of offence. Medical evidence 
by itself does not throw any light on the identity of the offender. 
Such evidence may confirm the available substantive evidence 
with regard to certain facts including seat of the injury, nature of 
the injury, cause of the death, kind of the weapon used in the 
occurrence, duration between the injuries and the death, and 
presence of an injured witness or the injured accused at the place 
of occurrence, but it does not connect the accused with the 
commission of the offence. It cannot constitute corroboration for 
proving involvement of the accused person in the commission of 
offence, as it does not establish the identity of the accused 
person.32 Therefore, the medical evidence is of little help to the 
prosecution for bringing home the guilt to the petitioners.” 
 
20. 
The plea of the learned District Public Prosecutor and the learned 
counsel for the complainant that because the complainant party had no 
enmity to falsely implicate the appellants in such a heinous crime thus, 
the evidence adduced should be believed, is entirely a misconceived one. 
It is a cardinal principle of justice and law that only the intrinsic worth 
and probative value of the evidence would play a decisive role in 
determining the guilt or innocence of an accused person. Even evidence 
of an uninterested witness, not inimical to the accused, may be corrupted 
deliberately while evidence of an inimical witness, if found consistent 
with the other evidence corroborating it, may be relied upon. Reliance in 
this regard may be placed on the case of “Waqar Zaheer vs. The State” 
(1991 PSC 281). It is a known and settled principle of law that the 

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No. 151 of 2019 
Crl. Revision  No. 148 of 2019 
38 
 
prosecution primarily is bound to establish guilt against the accused 
without a shadow of reasonable doubt by producing trustworthy, 
convincing and coherent evidence enabling the Court to draw a 
conclusion whether the prosecution has succeeded in establishing 
accusation against the accused or otherwise and if it comes to the 
conclusion that charges, so imputed against the accused, have not been 
proved beyond a reasonable doubt, then the accused becomes entitled to 
acquittal. In such a situation the Court has no jurisdiction to abridge such 
right of the accused. To ascertain as to whether the accused is entitled to 
the benefit of the doubt the Court can conclude by considering the 
agglomerated effect of the evidence available on record as held in the 
cases of “Safdar Ali v. The Crown” (PLD 1953 FC 93) and 
“Muhammad Luqman v. The State” (PLD 1970 SC 10). In the instant 
case we have scanned the prosecution evidence in-depth and we are 
persuaded to hold that the prosecution has failed to produce trustworthy, 
confidence-inspiring and consistent evidence against the appellants. 
Conversely, the evidence so brought on record appears to have been 
fabricated to prove the prosecution case. Even otherwise the  prosecution 
evidence suffers from material discrepancies, contradictions and 
omissions and for such reasons it has not proved the case against the 
accused persons intrinsically and if the evidence of such defective 
quality is accepted it would produce an illusory judgment which 
apparently would not be sustainable in the eyes of the law in view of the 
principles laid down by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan. Even 
otherwise the prosecution evidence is inconsistent and flawed, thus, on 

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No. 151 of 2019 
Crl. Revision  No. 148 of 2019 
39 
 
the basis of the same, appellants cannot further be immured because they 
have every right to claim guarantee of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan,1973 which provides that every citizen of the 
country shall be dealt with in accordance with the law.  
21. 
Considering all the above circumstances, we entertain serious 
doubt in our minds regarding the involvement of the appellants namely 
Muhammad Nadeem and Muhammad Zahid alias Billa in the present 
case. It is a settled principle of law that for giving benefit of doubt it is 
not necessary that there should be so many circumstances rather if only a 
single circumstance creating reasonable doubt in the mind of a prudent 
person is available then such benefit is to be extended to an accused not 
as a matter of concession but as of right. The august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the case of “Muhammad Mansha Vs. The State” (2018 
SCMR 772) has enunciated the following principle: 
“Needless to mention that while giving the benefit of 
doubt to an accused it is not necessary that there should 
be many circumstances creating doubt. If there is a 
circumstance which creates reasonable doubt in a 
prudent mind about the guilt of the accused, then the 
accused would be entitled to the benefit of such doubt, 
not as a matter of grace and concession, but as a matter 
of right. It is based on the maxim, "it is better that ten 
guilty persons be acquitted rather than one innocent 
person be convicted". Reliance in this behalf can be 
made upon the cases of Tariq Pervez v. The State (1995 
SCMR 1345), Ghulam Qadir and 2 others v. The State 
(2008 SCMR 1221), Muhammad Akramv.The State 
(2009 SCMR 230) and Muhammad Zamanv.The State 
(2014 SCMR 749).” 
 
Reliance is also placed on the judgment of the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan Najaf Ali Shah Vs. the State (2021 S C M R 736) in which it 
has been observed in as infra: 

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No. 151 of 2019 
Crl. Revision  No. 148 of 2019 
40 
 
“9. 
Mere heinousness of the offence if not proved 
to the hilt is not a ground to avail the majesty of the 
court to do complete justice. This is an established 
principle of law and equity that it is better that 100 
guilty persons should let off but one innocent person 
should not suffer. As the preeminent English jurist 
William Blackstone wrote, "Better that ten guilty 
persons escape, than that one innocent suffer." 
Benjamin Franklin, who was one of the leading figures 
of early American history, went further arguing "it is 
better a hundred guilty persons should escape than 
one 
innocent 
person 
should 
suffer." 
All 
the 
contradictions noted by the learned High Court are 
sufficient to cast a shadow of doubt on the 
prosecution's case, which entitles the petitioner to the 
right of benefit of the doubt. It is a well settled 
principle of law that for the accused to be afforded 
this right of the benefit of the doubt it is not necessary 
that there should be many circumstances creating 
uncertainty and if there is only one doubt, the benefit 
of the same must got to the petitioner. This Court in 
the case of Mst. Asia Bibi v. The State (PLD 2019 SC 
64) while relying on the the earlier judgments of this 
Court has categorically held that "if a single 
circumstance creates reasonable doubt in a prudent 
mind about the apprehension of guilt of an accused, 
then he/she shall be entitled to such benefit not as a 
matter of grace and concession, but as of right. 
Reference in this regard may be made to the cases of 
Tariq Pervaiz v. The State (1998 SCMR 1345) and 
Ayub Masih v. The State (PLD 2002 SC 1048)." The 
same view was reiterated in Abdul Jabbar v. State 
(2010 SCMR 129) when this court observed that once 
a single loophole is observed in a case presented by 
the prosecution, such as conflict in the ocular account 
and medical evidence or presence of eyewitnesses 
being doubtful, the benefit of such loophole/lacuna in 
the prosecution's case automatically goes in favour of 
an accused.” 
 
22.  
 For what has been discussed above the Criminal Appeal No. 151 
of 2019  lodged by Muhammad Zahid alias Billa son of Muzammil  and 
Muhammad Nadeem son of Neghaban is allowed and the convictions 
and sentences of the appellants awarded by the learned trial court 
through the impugned judgment dated 28.02.2019 are hereby set-aside. 
Muhammad Nadeem son of Neghaban and Muhammad Zahid alias Billa 
son of Muzammil (appellants) are ordered to be acquitted by extending 

Murder Reference No.28 of 2019

them the benefit of doubt. Muhammad Nadeem son of Neghaban is in 
custody and is  directed to be released forthwith if not required in any 
other case. The sentence of the appellant namely Muhammad Zahid alias 
Billa son of Muzammil was suspended by this Court vide order dated 
11.04.2022 and the appellant namely Muhammad Zahid alias Billa son 
of Muzammil is present before the Court on bail. The surety of the 
appellant shall stand discharged from his liability and the bail bonds 
submitted by the appellant namely Muhammad Zahid alias Billa son of 
Muzammil are hereby cancelled. 
 
23. 
Pursuant to the discussion made and conclusions arrived at above, 
the Criminal Revision No. 148 of 2019, seeking the enhancement of the 
sentence of the convict namely Muhammad Zahid alias Billa son of 
Muzammil, is hereby dismissed. 
 
24. 
Murder Reference No.28 of 2019 is answered in Negative and 
the death sentence awarded to Muhammad Nadeem son of Neghaban is 
Not Confirmed.
