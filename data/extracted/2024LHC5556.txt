Asjad Javaid Ghural, J.       Through the afore-titled criminal appeal, 
appellant Muhammad Waqas has challenged the vires of judgment dated 
15.07.2019 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Daska in case 
FIR No.151/16, dated 15.07.2019 in respect of an offence U/S 302PPC 
registered at P/S Moutra, District Sialkot whereby he was convicted and 
sentenced as under:- 
 
 
Under Section 302(b) PPC as Tazir 
Death and to pay the compensation amounting to Rs.5,00,000/- to the legal 
heirs of deceased namely, Samina Bibi under Section 544-A Cr.P.C. and in 
default thereof, to further undergo simple imprisonment for six months.  
 
  
2. 
Murder Reference No.215/2019 for confirmation or otherwise of death 
sentence of the appellant shall also be decided through this common 
judgment.  
3. 
The prosecution story unfolded in the crime report (Ex.PB) registered 
on the complaint of complainant Muhammad Adnan (PW-4) is that his sister 

Crl. Appeal No.66722 of 2019 
 
2 
Murder Reference No.215 of 2019 
 
 
 
Mst. Samina Bibi was married with Muhammad Waqas (appellant) 7/8 
months ago. After 20/25 days of the marriage, appellant went Saudi Arabia 
and came back to Pakistan 20/25 days prior to the alleged occurrence. After 
arrival in Pakistan, appellant developed illicit relation with his sister in law 
(Sali) namely Anam and this fact came into light when 4/5 days prior to the 
occurrence the appellant while leaving his wife in his house, visited the house 
of complainant and in connivance with Anam administered intoxicated tea, 
due to which entire family of the complainant except said Anam became 
unconscious. In the intervening night of 3/4th of April, 2016 at about 3.00 a.m. 
appellant informed the complainant telephonically that his wife Samina has 
died due to cardiac arrest. Complainant has strong suspicion that the appellant 
in order to contract marriage with his Sali committed the murder of his wife 
by administering some poisonous material.    
4.    Iftikhar Ahmad,S.I. (PW-12) visited the place of occurrence on the same 
day, prepared injury statement (Ex.PJ), inquest report (Ex.PK) of deceased 
Mst. Samina Bibi and escorted the dead body to mortuary for autopsy. He 
collected two empty strips of lorazepam 2mg Arsopal from the place of 
occurrence vide memo (Ex.PE), prepared rough site plan of the place of 
occurrence and recovery (Ex.PM), recorded the statement of PWs and took all 
other necessary steps of initial investigation. He arrested the appellant on 
13.04.2016 who during investigation disclosed that he purchased intoxicant 
tablets from Mughal Medical Store, Adda Badian and also got recovered three 
strips of tablets from his residential room vide memo (Ex.PG). He got 
prepared report U/S 173 Cr.P.C and submitted through the SHO concerned. 
5. 
Lady Dr. Shumaila Naz (PW-7) had conducted autopsy on the dead 
body of deceased Mst. Samina Bibi on 04.04.2016 at about 7.10 p.m. and 
observed two dirty black colour impressions on both sides of the neck. On 
receipt of report of PFSA, she formed an opinion that death occurred in 
asphyxia mode alongwith poisoning. Duration between injury and death was 
immediate, whereas, between death and postmortem examination report 14 to 
20 hours. 
 
6. 
At the commencement of the trial, the learned trial Court had framed a 
charge against the appellant to which he had pleaded not guilty and claimed 
to be tried.  

Crl. Appeal No.66722 of 2019 
 
3 
Murder Reference No.215 of 2019 
 
 
 
7. 
The prosecution had produced 12-witnesses beside the report of Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency (Ex.PN).  The appellant in his statement recorded 
under Section 342 Cr.P.C. had denied and controverted all the allegations 
leveled against him, he neither opted to make statement under Section 340(2) 
Cr.P.C. nor produced any evidence in defence.  
8. 
Learned trial Court, upon conclusion of the trial convicted and 
sentenced the appellant as stated above. Hence the aforementioned criminal 
appeal as well as the connected Murder Reference.   
9. 
We have heard learned counsels for the appellant, learned Additional 
Prosecutor General appearing for the State and perused the record with their 
able assistance.   
10. 
In this unfortunate case, a young girl aged about 21/22 years met with 
unnatural death in the intervening night of 3/4th day of April, 2016 inside her 
bed room and her legal heirs raised accusing fingers towards the husband/ 
appellant responsible for committing her murder, thus, there was no 
possibility of direct evidence and the prosecution has to establish its case on 
the basis of circumstantial evidence, which comprises of following pieces:- 
(i)  
Extra judicial confession.  
 
(ii) 
Medical evidence.  
 
(iii)    Recovery of strips of tablets.  
First link in the chain of circumstantial evidence was the extra judicial 
confession of the appellant made before Muhammad Amir Nadeem (PW-6) 
& Muhammad Azeem (PW-8). Both of them while appearing in the dock in 
the court room unanimously stated that on 04.04.2016 upon hearing the news 
of death of Mst. Samina, they reached in the house of the appellant for 
obituary, when brother of the deceased namely Muhammad Adnan (PW-
4)/complainant told them that his sister was murdered by the appellant. At 
about 2.00 p.m. appellant invited them and one Amir (given up PW) to a 
corner for telling them something and thereafter took them to the fields, where 
he confessed before them that he committed the murder of deceased by 
administering poisonous tablets and strangulating her and requested for 
managing pardon for him. Both the said witnesses were cross-examined but 
they remained firm and consistent on material points and the prosecution has 
failed to extract any favourable material from their mouths. A question     

Crl. Appeal No.66722 of 2019 
 
4 
Murder Reference No.215 of 2019 
 
 
 
might arise in a prudent mind that why would the appellant confess his guilt 
before the aforesaid PWs for inviting trouble for him, the answer is first of all 
the appellant tried to give the murder, a colour of natural death but when the 
legal heirs of the deceased decided to get lodge the criminal case against him 
qua the murder of deceased, he in order to save his skin attempted to manage 
the situation. Muhammad Amir Nadeem, (PW-6) belongs to Lamberdar 
family of village of the complainant and in our rural set up no one can deny 
the influence of said family upon the villagers. Similarly, Muhammad Azeem, 
(PW-8) was close family relative of the complainant, as such he was also a 
suitable person to use his influence for securing clean chit to the appellant, 
therefore, keeping in mind these factors the appellant made extra judicial 
confession before them. Moreso, both the witnesses were neutral persons 
having no direct relationship with the complainant and at the same time have 
no animosity or ill will against the appellant for falsely involving him in the 
charge of capital punishment.  Even the appellant in his statement recorded 
U/S 342 Cr.P.C. did not question the neutrality of these witnesses or even a 
slight indication of their hostility towards him. Both the witnesses faced the 
test of cross-examination with confidence, therefore, their evidence being free 
from any bias deserves consideration.  
11. 
Second incriminating piece of evidence against the appellant was 
medical evidence. Lady Dr. Shumaila Naz, (PW-7) had conducted autopsy on 
the dead body of deceased Mst. Samina Bibi on 04.04.2016 at about 7.10 p.m. 
and observed two dirty black colour impressions on both sides of the neck. 
Duration between injury and death was immediate, whereas, death and 
postmortem examination report was 14 to 20 hours.  According to her opinion 
death occurred due to asphyxia mode along with poisoning. Thus, medical 
evidence confirmed that deceased met with an unnatural death.  
12. 
Third and most important piece of circumstantial evidence in this case 
is recovery of two empty strips of Lorazepam 2mg Arsopal from the place of 
occurrence and a packet of Lorazepam 2mg Arsopal got recovered by the 
appellant. At the time of postmortem examination of the deceased, her liver, 
lung, stomach, kidney, heart, brain and blood of the deceased were sent to the 
office of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore for expert opinion and 
according to the report of said office (Ex.PN), liver of deceased contained 

Crl. Appeal No.66722 of 2019 
 
5 
Murder Reference No.215 of 2019 
 
 
 
11.195 mg/Kg Lorazepam. Two empty leaves of tablet were secured from the 
residential room of the deceased. The said room was in exclusive possession/ 
use of the appellant and his deceased wife and there is no possibility of 
plantation of said empty leaves of the tablet upon the appellant. Moreso, a 
packet of Lorazepam 2mg Arsopal got recovered by the appellant was also 
sent to the office of PFSA on 27.04.2016 and the report of said office has been 
received on 28.09.2016. Till the arrival of report of PFSA, even no medical 
expert was in a position to determine what kind of poisonous material was 
administered to the deceased, except the person who administered the same. 
Presence of two empty leaves of tablets at the spot and getting recover rest of 
the same tablets by the appellant himself much prior to the report of PFSA 
shows that the appellant was responsible for administering huge quantity of 
tablets to the deceased. There is no cavil to the proposition that such kind of 
tablets are available in the medical stores and can easily be secured for the 
purpose of plantation but here in this particular case, the appellant himself 
disclosed the name of the Mughal Medical Store owned by Haroon s/o 
Mukhtar from where he purchased the said tablets and the Investigating 
Officer (PW-12) while appearing in the witness box  deposed that he joined 
said Haroon during investigation, who confirmed purchase of tablets by the 
appellant and he placed his statement on record. Moreso, as has been 
discussed supra prior to the report of PFSA, the prosecution could not take 
risk of planting the same on its own, as if in the end, in the report of PFSA 
some other material detected, then it would have serious consequences qua 
the veracity of prosecution story. Thus, we can safely conclude that the 
recovery lends full support to the prosecution story.  
13. 
 Learned counsel for the appellant laid much emphasis that there is no 
eye-witness of the occurrence, who saw the appellant committing the murder 
of deceased and the entire case of the prosecution is based on suspicion, which 
whosoever strong was cannot be made basis for maintaining the conviction 
and sentence of the appellant. This submission of the learned counsel is 
repelled. No doubt it was the duty of the prosecution to prove the guilt of an 
accused beyond the shadow of doubt which as has been discussed supra has 
successfully been discharged by it but at the same we may not ignore that 
where a wife met with an unnatural death inside the privacy of room at odd 

Crl. Appeal No.66722 of 2019 
 
6 
Murder Reference No.215 of 2019 
 
 
 
hours of the night, the only one person who has access to the bedroom was 
the husband and he was the sole person, who has exclusive knowledge as to 
what happened to his wife inside the room, as such onus was also shifted upon 
him to prove this fact. In this regard reference can be made to Article 122 of 
Qanun-e-Shahadat 1984 which for ready reference is reproduced as under:- 
“122. Burden of proving fact especially within knowledge. When any fact is 
especially within the knowledge of any person the burden of proving that fact is 
upon him.” 
 
Herein the instant case, two dirty scars around the neck of the deceased 
were visible as noted by the Medical Officer but the appellant who was 
supposed to be the protector of his wife, instead of exploring cause of such 
marks on the neck of deceased, prematurely announced that the deceased died 
due to cardiac arrest. This haste on the part of the appellant suggested 
something fishy on his part.  It is, therefore, observed that in cases where the 
offence is committed in a privacy of room, no doubt initial burden is upon the 
prosecution but the onus would comparatively be of lighter nature and if the 
husband or the wife as the case may be failed to offer an explanation how 
his/her partner met with unnatural death inside the bedroom, the same can be 
considered an additional factor qua his/her guilt.  
14. 
Besides above, in such like cases where the offence was committed in 
the privacy of room, the first version of the accused is of much significance. 
Here in the instant case, at the time of arrest of the appellant, he disclosed that 
from the day one, he intends to marry younger sister of the deceased namely 
Anam Bibi but the family of the deceased was not ready to give hand of their 
younger daughter in the presence of elder, as such his marriage was arranged 
with the deceased. However, he made his mind to get married with Anam 
Bibi, but for achieving this goal deceased was the main hurdle and he made 
different plans to remove her from his way. On the fateful day, he arranged 
intoxicant pills and after grinding the same asked the deceased to take the 
same for the treatment of abdomen pain. Thereafter, he kept on waiting for 
the death of the deceased. At about 2.00 p.m. when he observed that deceased 
was still breathing, he put a pillow on her mouth and choked her breath. 
Thereafter, around 3 ½ a.m. (night), he told his family members and took the 
deceased to the hospital, where, the doctor confirmed her death. He informed 

Crl. Appeal No.66722 of 2019 
 
7 
Murder Reference No.215 of 2019 
 
 
 
the parents of deceased that she died due to cardiac arrest. During 
investigation first version of the appellant was found correct. It is well settled 
by now that first plea of an accused is admissible piece of evidence. Reliance 
is placed on case reported as “Raza and another ..Vs.. The State and another  
(2020 SCMR 1185)”, wherein it has been laid down as under:- 
 
  “It is an admitted fact that first plea of the accused is admissible in evidence under Article 
27 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (“Order of 1984”). Article 27 of Order 1984 is general 
principle enabling the Investigating Officer to record the same whereas Article 28 is mere an 
exception. As a general rule evidence no forming part of the transaction is not admissible whereas 
Articles 27/28 are an exceptions to the said general principle by laying down a rule that admissibility 
of those fact which might not be tendered in evidence to prove it but these are relevant to prove the 
status/mind the person committing it. For example the guilt, intent, knowledge, negligence, malice 
etc. and in all the intentions qua these conditions would be an admissibility as it provided under 
Article 27 of the Order of 1984. Article 27 of the Order of 1984 has extended the scope to meet the 
question qua the existence of person state of mind or bodily feeling and all these facts and their 
existence in the state of affair has turned relevant.” 
  
We are cognizant of the fact that admission of the appellant before the 
police cannot be made sole ground for maintaining his conviction and 
sentence, but keeping in view peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, 
where other links as stated above have been satisfactorily established by the 
prosecution and the circumstances accusing the appellant to be the only 
assailant with certainty, the same can be considered an additional link which 
completes the chain.  
15. 
Motive as set out by the prosecution was that the appellant intends to 
get marry younger sister of the deceased and in order to achieve this goal, he 
committed this crime. The complainant while appearing in the dock in the 
court room reiterated the same in the following terms:-  
           “Accused committed murder of my sister due to the reason that he 
intended to contract marriage with my younger sister Anam and to remove 
my sister from his way, he has committed his murder.” 
 
Learned defence counsel laid much emphasis that the complainant 
while appearing in the dock in the court room did not narrate the motive part 
of the occurrence in the same words as alleged in the crime report and omitted 
the major part whereby he alleged that the appellant developed illicit relation 
with younger sister of deceased namely Anam and also administered 
intoxication to the entire family with her connivance, which was duly 

Crl. Appeal No.66722 of 2019 
 
8 
Murder Reference No.215 of 2019 
 
 
 
confronted to him. That may be so but this does not in any manner can be 
construed that the complainant has not supported the motive part of the 
occurrence. Main part of the motive has been clearly stated by the complainant 
in his examination in chief, which served the very purpose. Even otherwise, 
when the omitted part of Fard Bayan (Ex.PD) was confronted to the 
complainant, he conceded said facts, as such by confronting the same, the 
defence helped the prosecution in many words to establish the same. Moreso, 
both the witnesses of extra judicial confession namely Muhammad Amir 
Nadeen and Muhammad Azeem/ (PW-7&8), also categorically stated that the 
appellant confessed before them that he committed the murder of his wife, in 
order to get marry with her younger sister and the defence could not shatter 
their credibility on this point. Additionally, the appellant upon his arrest,  in 
his first version also conceded that the only purpose for committing the 
murder of deceased was to get marry with her sister, which though has been 
denied by him subsequently in his statement recorded under section 342 
Cr.P.C. yet as has been observed supra in cases where a partner met with 
unnatural death in a privacy of room, first version of the surviving partner has 
persuasive value and cannot be ignored at all, as such the same also strengthen 
the version of the prosecution. Hence, we can safely say that the prosecution 
has successfully proved the motive part of the occurrence. 
 16. 
From this discussion, we have no hesitation in holding that the 
prosecution has successfully proved the charge of homicidal death of the 
deceased at the hand of the appellant through cogent, reliable and confidence 
inspiring evidence. Appellant being the sole person, having access to his 
bedroom, where the deceased breathed her last in odd hours of the night was 
supposed to have exclusive knowledge regarding the circumstances, faced by 
the deceased, prior to her death and he was duty bound to explain the same to 
the satisfaction of a prudent mind and his failure to do so was an additional 
factor pointing finger towards him. It is reiterated that in cases where crime 
committed in the privacy of room, first version of the accused has also 
persuasive value and can be considered an additional factor in the chain of 
circumstantial evidence. Similarly, while scanning circumstantial evidence, in 
cases where a partner breathed his/her last, inside the privacy of room, 
stringent principles may not be applied and the conduct of the surviving 

Crl. Appeal No.66722 of 2019 
 
9 
Murder Reference No.215 of 2019 
 
 
 
partner in dealing with such situation must be taken due care of. If a surviving 
partner instead of informing the police and without making any effort to 
determine the cause of death, in particular, when some kind of marks or 
violence was visible upon the dead body, adverse inference can be drawn 
against him/her. It is not the duty of the prosecution to meet each and every 
hypothesis put forward by an accused. No doubt, it is the duty of a Judge 
presiding over a criminal trial to ensure that no innocent person is punished 
but at the same it is also an obligation of the Court to see that a guilty person 
does not escape. In view of what has been discussed supra, we are constrained 
to concur with the conclusion arrived at by the trial Court qua the conviction 
of the appellant under Section 302(b) PPC. 
17. 
Now coming to the quantum of sentence, it is well settled by now that 
question of quantum of sentence, requires utmost caution and thoughtfulness 
on the part of the Court. In this regard, reliance is placed on case reported as 
Mir Muhammad alias Miro ..Vs.. The State (2009 SCMR 1188) wherein it has 
been laid as under:- 
“It will not be out of place to emphasize that in criminal cases, the question 
of quantum of sentence requires utmost care and caution on the part of the 
Courts, as such decisions restrict the life and liberties of the people. Indeed 
the accused persons are also entitled to extenuating benefit of doubt to the 
extent of quantum of sentence’. 
Here in the instant case, there is no direct evidence against the appellant and 
the entire case hinges upon circumstantial evidence, therefore, as a matter of 
caution, we consider it a mitigating circumstance for awarding the appellant 
lessor punishment. Even otherwise, it is settled principle of law that when a 
case qualifies the awarding of both sentences of imprisonment for life and that 
of the death, the proper course for the Courts, as a matter of caution, is to give 
preference to the lesser sentence.  Reference may be made to case titled 
“GHULAM MOHY-UD-DIN alias HAJI BABU and others versus The STATE 
(2014 SCMR 1034)” wherein it has been observed at page 1044 as:- 
“In any case, if a single doubt or ground is available, creating 
reasonable doubt in the mind of Court/Judge to award death penalty 
or life imprisonment, it would be sufficient circumstances to adopt 
alternative course by awarding life imprisonment instead of death 
sentence.”

10 
Murder Reference No.215 of 2019 
 
 
 
 
18. 
In view of what has been discussed above, the appeal in hand stands 
dismissed by maintaining his conviction in offence under Section 302(b) PPC, 
however his sentence of capital punishment is converted into one of 
imprisonment for life. The amount of compensation and sentence in lieu 
thereof shall remain intact.  The appellant is given benefit of Section 382-B 
Cr.P.C. 
19. 
Murder Reference No.215 of 2019 is answered in the NEGATIVE 
and the Death Sentence awarded to appellant Muhammad Waqas is not 
confirmed.
