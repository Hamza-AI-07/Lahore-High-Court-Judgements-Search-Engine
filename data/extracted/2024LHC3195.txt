18655, 18659 & 18665 of 2021, which are seeking 
enhancement in the quantum of price / value of the acquired 
land.    
3. 
Brief facts of the case are that respondents / landowners 
filed seven (07) Reference Applications and appellants besides 
contesting the same also filed a Reference Application 
challenging the award dated 20.01.2014, announced by the 
Land Acquisition Collector for acquisition of total land 
measuring 4201 Kanal 14 Marla situated at Mouza Wan Khara 
Tehsil Chunian, District Kasur, for shifting of Ammunition 
Depot Thokar Niaz Baig to Wan Khara, whereby the 
respondents were awarded compensation amount @ Rs. 
10,50,000/- per Acre for "On Road" land and Rs.8,50,000/- per 
Acre for "Off Road" land. The parties filed their respective 
written replies. Out of divergent pleadings of the parties, the 
Referee Court framed following issues: -

After recording evidence and hearing arguments from all 
sides, the Referee Court, vide consolidated judgment dated 
12.02.2021, partly accepted the Reference Applications of 

4 
RFA No.31423 of 2021& connected cases 
respondents and dismissed the Reference Application of 
appellants in the above manner. Hence, these appeals. 
4. 
Learned counsel for appellants submits that the 
respondents have received their due share of compensation 
without any protest and only a very few of them agitated the 
matter before the Referee Court. He adds that the Referee Court 
has wrongly held nature of land as “industrial” when no 
documentary evidence was available on record which could 
justify such character of the land. He further submits that the 
land in dispute was neither situated at edge of Multan Road 
(rather 6 to 7 km away) nor in close vicinity of Balloki Power 
Plant (rather 12 to 13 km away) and this aspect of the matter 
was also not considered while passing the impugned judgment. 
He argues that no cogent evidence was produced before the 
Court to establish that price of the land had escalated during the 
period between issuance of Notification u/s 4 of the Act of 1894 
and announcement of the award, hence no question for grant of 
compound interest was there. He next submits that documentary 
evidence (Ex.R-4 & Ex.R-5), adduced by appellants, was not 
appreciated by the Referee Court. He maintains that most of the 
documentary evidence was exhibited in the statement of 
counsel and undue weightage was given by the Referee Court 
to such evidence, which was not permissible under the law, 
hence impugned judgment is unsustainable in the eye of law. In 
support, he has relied upon judgment dated 24.11.2022 passed 
by a learned Division Bench of this Court in R.F.A. No.74504 
of 2019 titled Federation of Pakistan, etc. v. Ghulam Mustafa, 
etc.  
5. 
Conversely, learned counsel for respondents submits that 
the price assessed by the Land Acquisition Collector as well as 
the Referee Court is neither proper nor adequate as relevant 
factors, inter-alia, market value at the relevant time coupled 
with its potential value, time consumed in finalization of 

5 
RFA No.31423 of 2021& connected cases 
acquisition proceedings / payment of compensation and trend of 
increasing prices of lands located adjacent to the lands of 
respondents have not been taken into consideration while 
deciding the matter. In the end, he prays for enhancement in the 
price of acquired lands. 
6. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused.  
7. 
This is second round of litigation before this Court. In 
previous round, against judgment and decree dated 14.12.2018, 
passed by the Referee Court, a learned Division Bench of this 
Court vide order dated 22.05.2019, passed in RFA No.20349 of 
2019 titled Govt. of Pakistan through Secretary Ministry of 
Defence etc. v. Mushtaq Ahmad etc. after setting aside the 
decision remanded the matter to the Referee Court for decision 
afresh. Now, through judgment under challenge in these 
appeals, the Referee Court has enhanced the value / price of 
acquired land, as detailed in paragraph 2 of this judgment. 
Appellants are not satisfied by the decision of the Referee Court 
and are urging to restore the award announced by the Land 
Acquisition Collector. The respondents are also not still content 
with the price determined by the Referee Court and are 
claiming further enhancement by this Court.   
8. 
The pivotal issues No.1 to 6 are inter-linked and inter-
connected, hence collective determination thereof would cause 
no prejudice. The remaining issues No.7 to 9 have not been 
pressed before us. The precise controversy is whether the 
value of the acquired land fixed by the Land Acquisition 
Collector constitutes fair and just compensation or that of the 
Referee Court within contemplation of provisions of sections 
23 and 24 of the Land Acquisition Act 1894?  
 
9. 
Respondents / landowners adduced 13 witnesses and 
documentary evidence as Ex.A-1 to Ex.A-24, out of which 
Ex.A-2 to Ex.A-4 & Ex.A-9 to Ex.A-11 are mutations 
regarding different lands in Mouza Wan Khara whereas Ex.A-5 

6 
RFA No.31423 of 2021& connected cases 
is showing detail of various mutations sanctioned w.e.f. 
01.07.2012 to 30.06.2013 and the average sale price. 
Conversely, appellants presented 3 witnesses and documentary 
evidence as Ex.R-1 to Ex.R-21, which included attested copy of 
acceptance of average sale price fixed by District Price 
Assessment Committee (Ex.R-4) and detail of different sale 
deeds executed in the year 2011 qua lands in Mouza Wan 
Khara and average sale price (Ex.R-5), and another detail of 17 
mutations of various lands in Mouza Wan Khara (Ex.R-21). 
 
10. 
Admittedly, Notification u/s 4 of the Act of 1894 for 
acquiring land measuring 4201 Kanal 14 Marla situated at 
Mouza Wan Khara, Tehsil Chunian was issued on 09.12.2011, 
though initial steps for effecting acquisition had commenced 
since early 2011, and the Award was announced on 20.01.2014. 
Ex.A-2 is mutation No.4750 dated 30.04.2011, pertaining to 
land measuring 4 Kanal 4 Marla against consideration of 
Rs.12,00,000/-, Ex.A-3 is mutation No.4801 dated 21.06.2011 
regarding land measuring 7 Kanal 17 Marla against 
consideration of Rs.15,00,000/- and Ex.A-4 is mutation 
No.4740 dated 28.02.2011, qua land measuring 4 Kanal 17 
Marla against consideration of Rs.15,00,000/-. All these 
mutations are pertaining to Mauza Wan Khara and average sale 
price of lands in Ex.A-2 to Ex.A-4 is approximately 
Rs.18,77,094/- per Acre. Ex.A-5 is showing as many as 34 
mutations pertaining to Mouza in question sanctioned w.e.f. 
01.07.2012 to 30.06.2013, reflecting average sale price as 
Rs.17,27,152/- per acre. Ex.A-8 was sanctioned on 29.01.2013 
and Ex.A-9 to Ex.A-11 are dated 29.09.2012. These mutations 
are showing sale price(s) on much higher side, however learned 
counsel for appellants has raised serious objection that the same 
being exhibited in the statement of learned counsel for 
respondents cannot be taken into consideration. Reference has 
also been made to the case of Ghulam Mustafa supra. 

7 
RFA No.31423 of 2021& connected cases 
Undoubtedly, this legal position is correct, therefore, we are 
confining ourselves to Ex.A-2 to Ex.A-5, admissibility and 
authenticity whereof was not disputed by the appellants, which 
were endorsed by Mukhtar Hussain, Halqa Patwari of Mouza 
Wan Khara (AW-10) – most crucial and proximate witness of 
this case – who deposed that mutations contained in Ex.A-2 to 
Ex.A-5 were correct as per his record and average sale price as 
per Ex.A-5 was Rs.17,27,152/-. On the converse, no plausible 
evidence was produced by the appellants to show any defect in 
the determination by the Referee Court. The witnesses 
produced by the appellants had no proximity or personal 
knowledge qua the matters, touching determination of the 
compensation. The absence of knowledge qua material facts 
cannot be construed or inferred as affirmation of the actual 
facts.  
 
 
The Award (Ex.A-6) though mentions that objections 
were filed by respondents / landowners, however no reasons are 
forthcoming therefrom which prevailed upon LAC to reject the 
objections. The award is based upon value assessed by the 
District Price Assessment Committee (which was approved by 
Board of Revenue), however none of the members was 
produced in evidence to explain the criteria adopted by the 
Committee while fixing the price. The award does not reflect 
independent assessment by the Land Acquisition Collector 
keeping in view the complexion and character of the acquired 
land, especially when respondents specifically asserted that 
their land was situated on main Multan Road. 
 
11. 
So far as stance of respondents that value of land / 
compensation is still not adequate is concerned, we have gone 
through the available evidence and found that PW-1 alleged 
price of acquired land as Rs.50,00,000/- per Acre (at the time of 
issuance of Notification u/s 4) and Rs.10,000,000/- at the time 
of announcement of Award. The other PWs also took almost 

8 
RFA No.31423 of 2021& connected cases 
similar stance, however they could not lead or tender any direct 
evidence to substantiate their stance inasmuch as their 
documentary evidence and statement of PW-10 are not 
supporting such value of the acquired land. Potentiality of the 
land was considered and accounted for while determining the 
compensation by the Referee Court. Mere production of 
handful of sale deeds, contemporaneous to the acquisition 
proceedings, is not enough to disbelieve the compensation 
already determined. 
 
12. 
As regards the stance of appellants that the value 
assessed by the Land Acquisition Collector as well as the 
Referee Court is on higher side, the RWs alleged value of on-
road land as Rs.300,000/- per Acre and that of off-road land as 
Rs.200,000/- and evasively denied the average sale price of 
Rs.17,27,152/- per Acre (reflected in Ex.A-5), however the 
stance is not supported by any direct evidence, let alone any 
believable evidence. RW-2, during cross-examination, could 
not state market value of the land in the years 2010 & 2011 and 
average sale value of land at the time of announcement of 
award. The reliance of appellants on Ex.R-5, showing average 
sale price of land as Rs.10,66,992/- per Acre is contradictory to 
the stance taken by the RWs. Even otherwise, this document 
shows that different lands were also sold @ Rs.20,00,000/- & 
Rs.24,74,226/- per Acre and authenticity of such sale deeds was 
not denied by appellants, which strengthens the case of 
respondents that the acquired land, being located near main 
road, had much potential value. Moreover, regarding land 
acquired in the year 2015 for Balloki Power Plant @ 
Rs.34,98,000/- per Acre (as per stance of PWs), appellants 
could not advance any explanation / reason for fixation of such 
compensation for land in same Mouza, especially when AW-10 
(Halqa Patwari) stated that as per Aks Shajra (Ex.A-1), the 
distance between acquired land and Balloki Power Plant was 

9 
RFA No.31423 of 2021& connected cases 
approximately 01 km. Predominantly, nature of the land, after 
assessing its potential value, is industrial and it would be sheer 
exaggeration to classify it as commercial for the purposes of 
determining compensation thereof.      
 
13. 
The Referee Court has taken into consideration the 
market value of the land and the factum of delay in concluding 
acquisition proceedings and payment of compensation and price 
escalation during the intervening period. The Referee Court has 
also rightly appreciated the fact that the period for 
determination of compensation was the period between 
issuance of Notification u/s 4 and announcement of award 
besides average sale price of the sold land within a period of 
twelve (12) months before issuance of Notification u/s 4. Some 
of the mutations mentioned in Ex.A-2 to Ex.A-5 were 
sanctioned before the date of issuance of Notification under 
section 4 of the Act of 1894 and some were passed before the 
announcement of the award. 
14. 
Under the law, determination of compensation for the 
land compulsorily acquired was the duty not only of the 
State/executive 
functionaries 
(particularly 
of 
the 
Land 
Acquisition Collector), but once the landowners were not 
compensated by them, the duty for such determination, under 
the Constitution and the law, was cast upon the judicial forums, 
including the Referee Court and the superior Courts. Evidence 
brought on record by the parties is to be seen in its entirety, 
stressing less qua the obligation of the onus to prove, and 
applying the principle of preponderance of evidence. Appellants 
as well as respondents are unable to convince this court to 
disbelieve the compensation determined by the Referee Court. 
Learned counsel for the parties have failed to establish that the 
conditions / parameters contained in Sections 23 & 24 of the 
Act of 1894 have not been considered by the Referee Court 
while determining compensation. The Referee Court has rightly 

10 
RFA No.31423 of 2021& connected cases 
appreciated the material / evidence brought on record, facts of 
the case, applicable law and dictum laid down by the superior 
Courts while passing the impugned decision. Learned counsel 
for the parties could not make out a case for interference by us 
in the impugned decision in exercise of appellate jurisdiction. 
15. 
In view of the above, instant as well as connected 
appeals, being devoid of merits, are dismissed. No order as to 
costs.
