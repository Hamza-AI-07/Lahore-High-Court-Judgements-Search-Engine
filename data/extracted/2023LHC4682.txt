Petitioner By: 
Major (R) Muhammad Adeel Hussain, Advocate 
alongwith petitioner in person. 
Respondent No.2 
By: 
Mr. 
Muhammad 
Shahzad 
Khan 
Kakar, 
Advocate alongwith respondent No.2 in person 
as well as the minor.  
 
      Anwaar Hussain J. Kamran Saeed (“the petitioner”) is real father 
whereas Nazima Noreen Niazi (“the respondent”) is the real mother of 
Hareem Fatima (“the minor”). The contest between the petitioner and the 
respondent is regarding permanent custody of the minor. The marriage 
between the parties was dissolved on 12.04.2021. The petitioner is serving 
in Pakistan Army as Colonel whereas the respondent is a doctor by 
profession and is also employed.  
2.  
As it happens in most of the cases after dissolution of the 
marriage, it is the ego of the parties which has taken precedence over the 
welfare of the minor that they are actively litigating to get the permanent 
custody of the minor for which the petitioner filed a guardian petition 
before Judge Guardian Court, Rawalpindi that was later on transferred to 
Mianwali by the order of this Court. Through order dated 23.05.2022, 
learned Guardian Judge, Mianwali, allowed the guardian petition of the 
petitioner keeping in view the preference of the minor, in favor of the 
petitioner, and also chalked out a comprehensive visitation schedule, 
enabling the respondent to meet the minor. Order dated 23.05.2022 was 
challenged by the respondent by preferring appeal. The learned Additional 

 
 
2 
W.P No.15564/2023 
District Judge, Mianwali, vide judgment dated 11.02.2023, allowed the 
appeal and reversed the findings of the learned Guardian Judge, Mianwali. 
Comprehensive meeting schedule chalked out by the learned Guardian 
Judge was held to be applicable to the petitioner, mutatis mutandis, as non-
custodial parent, hence, this constitutional petition.  
3.  
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that judgments of the 
learned Courts below are at variance and it is for this Court to opine as to 
which judgment is sustainable. Adds that the learned Trial Court passed a 
well-reasoned judgment that has been upended by the learned Appellate 
Court below without appreciating the welfare of the minor in general, and 
more particularly the preference recorded by the minor, in favor of the 
petitioner, before the learned Trial Court. Further contends that even the 
learned Appellate Court below itself has recorded that the respondent is a 
working lady, being a qualified doctor and the minor remained with the 
petitioner/father most of the time in the early days of the minor and hence, 
has developed strong parental bonding with him than with the respondent 
but has not given any weightage to the said factual aspect of the matter, 
therefore, same merits interference by this Court.   
4.  
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent submits that the 
sole ground on the basis of which the learned Trial Court granted the 
custody of the minor to the petitioner was preference of the minor who is 
naive and does not understand her welfare. Adds that since the petitioner 
has contracted second marriage, therefore, the minor cannot be left at the 
mercy of a step mother. Further contends that the respondent is still 
unmarried and committed to the welfare of the minor, therefore, being a 
mother, the respondent has a preferential right. Concludes that the second 
marriage of the petitioner was concealed before the learned Trial Court, 
therefore, the petitioner is not entitled to any discretionary/equitable relief 
from this Court.  
5.     
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
6.     
It is unfortunate to note that the children are tossed like balls in 
between the belligerent parents, due to their self-nurtured ego, after their 

 
 
3 
W.P No.15564/2023 
separation and/or divorce. It is growing as a social problem in our society. 
Needless to mention that a minor is entitled to have father‟s love and 
attention as well as mother‟s care and affection and the parents have got no 
right to interfere with the said inherent right of the children. However, what 
is happening in the society, for one reason or the other, is that the parents 
get separated, depriving the child of the normal love and affection and 
caring of the parents.  
7.    
In some cases, like one in hand, it also becomes difficult for the 
Court, if not impossible, to weigh as to exactly where welfare of the minor 
lies. On the one hand there is the respondent (mother), who is well 
educated and committed to better upbringing of the minor by imparting 
good education as depicted from various certificates given to the minor by 
her school and produced before this Court during the course of hearing and 
on the other hand, there is petitioner (father), who though has contracted 
second marriage but his love and care for the minor is exemplary inasmuch 
as the minor is equally attached to the petitioner, if not more than the 
respondent  and the said love and bonding clearly has been exhibited before 
this Court during multiple hearings and the minor‟s inclination towards the 
petitioner has also been noticed by this Court. It appears that the preference 
given by the minor, in favor of the petitioner, before the Trial Court was 
with her free will. This Court has also questioned the minor not only in 
open Court but also extended hearing in the chambers and she has not 
complained anything about the step mother.  
8.    
In view of above analysis of factual matrix of the case, the only 
question that requires determination by this Court is to opine whether 
preference of the minor can be the sole criterion for depriving the mother, who 
has not moved forward in her life except for the pursuit of earning her 
livelihood and has no other family obligations, except looking after the minor, 
as opposed to the petitioner who has re-married having another daughter from 
the second marriage. In such eventuality, a mother has more right over  
the child in case of separation unless she re-marries, although second  
marriage of the mother in itself is not an impediment. The Appellate Court 

 
 
4 
W.P No.15564/2023 
while ruling in favor of the respondent has encapsulated the controversy in 
the following words: 
“6. 
Admittedly, the appellant is a doctor by profession 
and respondent is serving as Lieutenant Colonel in 
Pakistan Army. It is evident from the record that the 
appellant did her house job and FCPS after 
marriage. It is also evident from the record that the 
minor mostly lived with her father after her birth 
because the appellant/mother had to go Services 
Hospital, Lahore, in connection with her job. It is 
evident from the record that the appellant left the 
job for 03 years for the sake of minor because she 
could not be transferred at the place of posting of 
respondent. Admittedly, during the pendency of 
application respondent contracted second marriage 
on 01.11.2021 and he has also a daughter from his 
second marriage. The fact of second marriage was 
neither raised nor discussed before the learned trial 
court. The appellant produced marriage certificate 
Exh.R4 
pertaining 
to 
second 
marriage 
of 
respondent as additional evidence before this court. 
The minor is studying in City School, Mianwali 
Campus, which is one of the best schools of 
District, Mianwali. There is nothing in the record 
which suggests that the appellant has any 
disqualification for the custody of the minor.”  
 
9.   
Keeping in mind the above analysis as to how custody issue is 
to be decided while considering the choice of the minor as also the 
reasoning of the learned Appellate Court, reproduced hereinabove and 
before rendering the opinion, it is imperative to note that both the 
petitioner and the respondent are well educated persons and they 
attended the proceedings before this Court on all dates of hearing along 
with the minor. In all fairness, this Court noticed that on most of the said 
dates of hearings the minor leaned in favor of the petitioner. This Court 
also sensed that the minor had fear of losing the respondent‟s love as she 
responded to one of the queries by this Court that she wants to 
permanently stay with the petitioner but want to meet the respondent as 
and when she wants and while stating so, the demeanor of the minor also 
exhibited the effect of stress she had been facing and the emotional 
trauma that she was passing through because of the legal battle that her 

 
 
5 
W.P No.15564/2023 
parents have been fighting to get her permanent custody. At the same 
time, it has been also noted that the petitioner as also the respondent 
appears to well understand the sensitivity of the issue and are equally 
concerned about the welfare of the minor who have a tilted heart towards 
the petitioner and has shown her preference to be with him. In this 
regard, it is worth mentioning that, on 09.08.2023, when the case was 
heard and it was the respondent‟s turn to take the minor with her, during 
the summer vacations, the minor showed extreme emotions to be with 
the petitioner and reluctance to accompany the respondent, the latter 
unhesitatingly allowed her to accompany the petitioner to ease out the 
emotional stress of the minor, on the said date. Similarly, the petitioner 
who well knew about the preference of the minor, in his favor, also 
persuaded the minor to go with the respondent as per the visitation 
schedule in field after attending the hearing on 13.09.2023, although the 
minor again remained reluctant. Here it is also imperative to mention 
that the respondent while praying for the dismissal of the petition also 
volunteered that she has no objections if the visitation schedule is made 
more conducive, in favor of the petitioner, allowing the latter to have the 
custody over the long weekends and shown her willingness to fully 
cooperate. These gestures on part of both the parents are appreciated as 
such approach is generally absent rather subdued by the personal egos 
and hostility sharpened by prejudices of the parties at play, while 
contesting a guardian case.  
10. 
Adverting to the nub of the matter, this Court is guided by the 
dicta laid down in case reported as “Mst. Aisha v. Manzoor Hussain and 
others” (PLD 1985 SC 436) where the Supreme Court of Pakistan held 
that the minor is not the best judge for his/her own welfare and his/her 
choice will only be considered if it is in the best interest of the minor. 
Therefore, it is for the Guardian Court to carefully determine as to how 
much preference and importance should be given to the choice of the 
minor. Suffice to note that no two cases are exactly the same. Each case 
has to be individually assessed on the basis of its peculiar facts and 

 
 
6 
W.P No.15564/2023 
circumstances to see what would be in the best interest of the minor, 
which is of overriding importance and the Superior Courts in this 
country have even held that the mother‟s remarriage does not necessitate 
her removal from guardianship since the minor‟s welfare may still be to 
remain with her. In case reported as “Abdul Razzaque and 3 others v. Dr. 
Rehana Shaheen and another” (PLD 2005 Karachi 610), the Sindh 
High Court held the minors therein to be unfit to decide where their 
welfare lies when the fight for the custody was between the paternal 
grandmother and the mother and the minors in the said case showed their 
disinclination towards the mother.  
11.    
This Court is also cognizant of the fact that a custody matter is 
a societal and human problem involving one of the most delicate aspects 
of the human life and is required to be adjudicated with humane touch. 
In this regard, while analyzing the facts of the case, the Court may not 
confine itself to the technical juggleries and/or the niceties of evidence, 
procedure or the precedents. What is paramount is the welfare and well-
being of the minor. While exercising parens patriae jurisdiction, the 
Courts are expected, nay bound, to give due weight to minor‟s health 
and education as well as intellectual and emotional development. On the 
top of it is moral and ethical values that cannot be ignored and the same 
are equal, or may be, even more important, essential and indispensable 
considerations while deciding the custody matters.  
12.   
In addition to the other factors, if the minor is old enough, his/ 
her opinion, rather to be precise, intelligent preference, does matter in 
deciding the custody. However, it is imperative to note that the word 
used in Section 17 of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 (“the Act”) in 
considering preference of the minor is „may‟ and not „shall‟. Section 17 
of the Act also contemplates as to how to analyze the minor‟s 
preference. The Court must consider the age and maturity of the child as 
also the reason for the preference while analyzing the preference. The 
preference is sometimes based on as to how a minor feel at the moment 
when the preference is given, changes in his/her life or a reaction to 

 
 
7 
W.P No.15564/2023 
something, for instance, being disciplined by the custodial parent. 
Therefore, preference of a minor does not debar the Court to appreciate 
the attending circumstances as to determine whether the preference of 
the minor is intelligent at all. There is possibility that behind the facade 
of preference lies the wishful intention of the minor to wriggle out of the 
disciplinary control of the custodial parent. For instance, disciplinary 
control by custodial parent by inculcating habits such as going to bed 
early or ensuring concentration in studies may instill some feeling in the 
minor that non-custodial parent is more entertaining as compared to the 
custodial parent. Suffice to note that the older and more mature the 
minor is, the more weight is to be given to the preference/choice. In a 
nutshell, it is the welfare of the minor that includes the minor‟s physical, 
mental and emotional well-being that is to be weighed in while keeping 
in view the preference given by the minor in favor of the petitioner. 
13.   
In view of the above legal position in relation to preference of 
the minor, this Court is of the opinion that the preference shown by the 
minor, in favor of the petitioner, in the instant case, cannot be taken by 
this Court to be the sole criterion in determining the welfare of the minor 
who, as of today, is approximately ten and half years old female child, 
and one cannot lose sight of a very germane biological aspect of the 
matter concerning the puberty and the privacy of the minor. The care and 
concern, on part of a custodial parent, needed by a minor girl of her age 
is of pivotal importance in this case. Had the minor been a male child 
and exhibited the preference, which the minor in the instant case has 
shown before this Court, in favor of the petitioner, this Court would have 
not hesitated to grant the permanent custody of the minor to the 
petitioner, however, in the instant case, the minor is a daughter and this 
Court is of the opinion that a female child between the age of ten (10) to 
fifteen (15) years face such biological changes that, at the said age, she 
would need her natural mother the most, as oppose to any other person 
including father and/or the step mother or a grandmother, more 
particularly when there is nothing on record to establish that the 

 
 
8 
W.P No.15564/2023 
respondent has any disability like contracting second marriage etc., on 
account of which she might be deprived of the permanent custody of the 
minor although second marriage of the mother, as observed earlier, is 
also not the sole ground to deprive a mother from the custody of the 
minor. Instead, the fact that the respondent is a professional doctor 
makes her even more suitable to have the custody of the minor at such a 
crucial age/stage of the minor, which this Court expects from the 
petitioner to realize, with a more balanced frame of mind.  
14.   
In view of the above, this Court is of the opinion that the 
impugned judgment, dated 11.02.2023, passed by the learned Appellate 
Court is well reasoned and does not merit any interference. As a natural 
corollary, the present petition fails and is dismissed. However, since the 
respondent has shown good gesture in the terms that she has no 
objection allowing the petitioner to have extended stay of the minor over 
the long weekends, it is expected that she will facilitate the petitioner 
and the minor for such extended meetings, as per her undertaking before 
this Court.
