Through 
this 
Constitutional Petition, petitioners assailed the vires of judgments 
and memos of cost of the Courts below whereby their application 
under Section 12(2) C.P.C. was dismissed concurrently.  
2. 
Facts in brevity are that predecessors of the respondents 
namely Abdul Ghaffar and Abdul Sattar instituted a suit for 
possession through pre-emption on 10.03.1990 against the 
petitioners before the Court of Civil Judge 1st Class, Haroonabad, 
Camp at Fortabbas and pre-empted the sale affected through 
mutation No.85 dated 12.03.1989 whereby land measuring 85 
Kanals was sold by Alam Khan s/o Langar Khan to the petitioners 
for a consideration of Rs.23,000/-; that suit was resisted through 
filing contesting written statement on 01.10.1990; that learned Trial 
Court, keeping in view divergent pleadings of the parties framed 

W.P. No. 3631 of 2015. 
2
necessary issues on 29.10.1990; that the learned Trial Court 
transmitted the file to the District Judge Bahawalnagar for onward 
entrustment as parties posed lack of confidence; that file was 
received on 05.03.1991 and on behalf of the plaintiffs Sheikh Karim-
ud-Din Advocate submitted his power of attorney, whereas, on 
behalf of the defendants Muhammad Iqbal Sohail, Advocate 
submitted power of attorney; that the case was entrusted to the Court 
of Civil Judge 1st Class, Bahawalnagar, with direction to the parties 
to appear before the said Court on 09.03.1991; that thereafter on 
behalf of defendants Vakalatnama was filed by Mirza Atta Ullah 
Qamar Advocate on 27.04.1991; that plaintiffs’ oral as well as 
documentary evidence was completed on 19.10.1991 and the case 
was adjourned for evidence of the defendants; that defendants moved 
an application on 07.01.1992 under Order VII Rule 11 C.P.C. for 
rejection of plaint; that plaintiffs filed its contesting written reply on 
07.03.1992; that the learned Trial Court allowed the same by 
rejecting the plaint vide order dated 28.02.1993 and resultantly the 
suit was dismissed vide decree dated 28.02.1993; that feeling 
aggrieved, plaintiffs preferred an appeal which was dismissed vide 
judgment & decree dated 12.02.1996; that plaintiffs assailed both the 
decrees before this Court through filing revision petition (C.R. 
No.525 of 1994/BWP) which was allowed by this Court vide order 
dated 15.06.1999 and the matter was remanded to the learned Trial 
Court in the following terms: 
 
“In this view of the matter, the impugned order is set-aside and 
the case is remanded to the learned Civil Judge with the 

W.P. No. 3631 of 2015. 
3
direction that he should complete the evidence and decide the 
suit in toto by attending to the issue involved including the issue 
of limitation.”  
 
That after remand of the case, defendants concluded their oral 
evidence on 05.11.2002 and closed their documentary evidence on 
08.11.2002; that the Court vide order dated 08.11.2002 adjourned the 
matter to 19.11.2002 for rebuttal evidence; that case was adjourned 
17 times for one pretext or other and lastly it was adjourned to 
22.06.2004 for rebuttal evidence with warning of last opportunity; 
that on 22.06.2004 when the case was fixed for rebuttal evidence of 
the plaintiffs, learned counsel for the defendants namely Mirza Atta 
Ullah Qamar appeared and maintained that compromise has been 
affected between the parties and defendants have no objection to 
decree the suit; that in the light of said statement, the learned Trial 
Court decreed the suit subject to payment of remaining consideration 
amount of Rs.18,400/- within a period of 30-days with the caution 
that if plaintiffs failed to pay the remaining consideration amount, 
the suit would be deemed to be dismissed; that the defendants, who 
are petitioners of instant petition, challenged said statement of their 
counsel, judgment & decree by moving an application on 18.01.2005 
under Section 12(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 with the 
contention that respondents/plaintiffs obtained the decree through 
fraud and mis-representation as neither any compromise has been 
affected between the parties nor they gave any authority to their 
counsel to get the suit decreed through compromise; that the 
respondents contested the application through filing written reply 

W.P. No. 3631 of 2015. 
4
wherein they raised certain preliminary objections and specifically 
pleaded that the suit was decreed on the instructions of petitioners; 
that the learned Trial Court, in the light of divergent stances of the 
parties framed necessary issues and invited them to produce their 
evidence in support of their respective stances; that learned Trial 
Court, after recording evidence of the parties pro & contra, oral as 
well as documentary, dismissed the application vide judgment & 
memo of cost dated 06.10.2012; that feeling aggrieved, the 
petitioners assailed said order through filing a revision petition 
which also met the same fate and dismissed by the learned 
Revisional Court vide judgment/memo of cost dated 02.05.2015. 
Being dissatisfied, the petitioners approached this Court through 
instant Constitutional Petition.  
3. 
Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners inter-
alia contends that impugned judgments & memos of cost are against 
the facts & law and result of mis-reading and non-reading of 
evidence. He adds that respondents instituted suit for possession 
through pre-emption which was hotly contested by the petitioners 
and after conclusion of trial there was no occasion to make 
compromise with them and get decreed their suit in the year 2004 for 
a consideration of Rs.23,000/- which was paid in the year 1989. He 
further maintained that the petitioners neither compromised with the 
respondents nor gave any authority to their counsel to make 
statement of compromise before the learned Trial Court. He also 
argued that respondents with collusion of their counsel got decreed 
their suit by playing fraud with the petitioners and prayed for 

W.P. No. 3631 of 2015. 
5
acceptance of this petition, setting aside of judgments dated 
06.10.2012 & 02.05.2015 and as a consequence thereof setting aside 
of impugned judgment & decree dated 22.06.2004.  
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel representing the respondents 
vehemently opposed the contentions of learned counsel for the 
petitioners and defended the impugned judgments & memos of cost 
by maintaining that there is no denial to the fact that petitioners 
engaged Mirza Atta Ullah Qamar, Advocate as their counsel, who 
represented them for 11 years and they did not pose any lack of 
confidence upon him; that being attorney of petitioners said 
Advocate had authority to make statement of compromise and get 
the suit decreed. In last, he prayed for dismissal of this petition.  
5. 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties at full length and 
perused the record with their able assistance.  
6. 
Admittedly, respondents instituted a suit for possession 
through pre-emption on 10.03.1990 whereby they pre-empted the 
sale affected through mutation No.85 dated 12.03.1989. It is matter 
of record that said suit was hotly contested and matter went upto this 
Court and after remand affirmative evidence of the parties was 
completed. After the longstanding period of 14 years when the case 
was fixed for rebuttal evidence, the case was decreed on the 
statement of learned counsel for the defendants (petitioners). 
Petitioners challenged said judgment & decree on the grounds of 
fraud and mis-representation by maintaining that neither they 
compromised with the respondents nor they gave any authority to 

W.P. No. 3631 of 2015. 
6
their counsel to make any statement of compromise and got decreed 
the respondents’ suit.  
7. 
Petitioners specifically pleaded their stance in para No.3 and 
para No.8 of their application under Section 12(2) C.P.C. which is 
reproduced in verbatim as under:

Respondents, in their written reply pleaded as under:

8. 
The learned Trial Court reduced the said controversy in the 
following terms: 
1. Whether judgment & decree dated 22.06.2004 is result of 
fraud? OPA 
 
2. Whether learned counsel for the petitioners in the original 
suit/respondent No.3 gave statement in the Court on the 
direction of petitioners and petitioners are bound by the 
statement of their counsel, this petition is false and frivolous 
and respondents are entitled to get special costs? OPR 
 
 
9. 
It is matter of record that when the case was transferred to the 
Court of Civil Judge, Bahawalnagar, Muhammad Iqbal Sohail, 
Advocate submitted his power of attorney on behalf of the 
defendants on 09.03.1991. Thereafter, without cancelling the earlier 
power of attorney a fresh Vakalatnama was filed from defendants 
side by Mirza Atta Ullah Qamar Advocate on 27.04.1991. It means 

W.P. No. 3631 of 2015. 
7
that defendants were being represented by two counsel on 
22.06.2004 but only Mirza Atta Ullah Qamar, Advocate, got 
recorded the statement on the said date. Petitioners, in their petition, 
alleged that said Mirza Atta Ullah Qamar Advocate with the 
collusion of respondents made a fraud with them by getting the suit 
of respondents decreed. Petitioners impleaded said Mirza Atta Ullah 
Qamar, Advocate, as respondent No.3 in his application u/s 12(2) 
C.P.C. Said Advocate was served personally who appeared before 
the Court on 05.12.2012 and prayed for an adjournment to file 
written reply but he failed to file the same on 04.01.2006, 
13.02.2006 and 13.03.2006. On 13.03.2006 he absented from the 
proceedings, hence, ex-parte proceedings were initiated against him. 
Thereafter, he died, therefore, his statement could not be recorded 
and his stance could not come on record. 
10. 
Before further discussion, it is better to see the proceedings 
conducted on 22.06.2004 and judgment passed on it.

At the margin of the order-sheet, his signature is available. At 
the end of his statement, the learned Trial Court also written as under: 
"ایبن وکلسن" 
12. 
Although said words are written but neither statement of 
learned counsel for the plaintiffs was recorded nor his signature was 

W.P. No. 3631 of 2015. 
8
obtained at the margin of order-sheet. Admittedly, at the time of 
recording of said statements neither plaintiffs nor defendants were in 
attendance before the Court as signatures or presence has not been 
marked anywhere in that order. Although, the learned Trial Court 
described that counsel for the parties wanted to get record their 
statement but neither statement of learned counsel for the plaintiffs 
was recorded nor his signature was available on the margin of order-
sheet which reflects that said counsel was also not available at that 
time. In the light of statement of Mirza Atta Ullah Qamar Advocate 
the learned Trial Court passed the order in the following terms: 
“In the light of statement of the learned counsel for the defendants, 
Mirza Atta Ullah Qamar, the instant suit for recovery of 
possession through pre-emption is decreed in the favour of the 
plaintiffs on the basis of compromise arrived at between the 
parties. The 1/5th of the suit transaction i.e. Zar-i-Punjum 
Rs.4600/- has already been deposited in the Court. In addition to 
the already deposited Zar-i-Punjum, the plaintiff would deposit 
further Rs.18,400/-, the remaining sale price in the Court within 
one month from today which the defendants would be entitled to 
receive and subject to above condition, the suit is decreed in 
favour of the plaintiffs, otherwise the suit of the plaintiffs would be 
deemed to be dismissed. Parties to bear their own cost.” 
 
13. 
It is matter of record that neither respondents/plaintiffs 
deposited the remaining consideration amount within stipulated 
period in the Court nor petitioners had withdrawn the Zar-i-Punjum. 
There is no evidence on record to suggest that petitioners tried to 
withdraw the amount deposited by the respondents. Had there been 
any compromise affected between the parties, the petitioners would 

W.P. No. 3631 of 2015. 
9
definitely have withdrawn as that said amount in the year 2004 was 
having substantial value.  
14. 
Petitioners specifically pleaded in their application that neither 
any compromise has been affected between the parties nor they gave 
any authority to their counsel to get recorded the statement of 
compromise and decree the suit. The suit remained pending for about 
14 years and it was hotly contested by the petitioners. In one round 
of litigation, the matter went upto this Court. It is strange that 
petitioners compromised the suit after lapse of 14 years when 
evidence of the parties had already been completed and the matter 
was fixed for rebuttal evidence of the respondents. It is also noted 
that alleged compromise had been affected without settling any 
terms & conditions and without reducing said terms and conditions 
in writing. Petitioners purchased the property measuring 85 Kanals 
through mutation No.85 dated 12.03.1989 for a consideration of 
Rs.23,000/- and the same was allegedly decreed to the respondents in 
the light of alleged compromise for the same consideration i.e. 
Rs.23,000/- in the year 2004 after lapse of 15 years. Admittedly, 
price of the properties were enhanced with the passage of time.  
15. 
The suit was decreed on the sole statement of petitioners’ 
counsel namely Mirza Atta Ullah Qamar, Advocate. Petitioners 
denied the fact regarding giving any authority to their counsel to 
make any statement of compromise, whereas, the stance of the 
respondents is that the said counsel was having such authority. As 
discussed earlier, stance of the Mirza Atta Ullah Qamar could not be 
brought on record either in the form of written reply or through his 

W.P. No. 3631 of 2015. 
10
statement. Later on, he died. In this regard, the material document 
was the Vakalatnama executed in favour of Mirza Atta Ullah Qamar 
Advocate by the petitioners. Although, it was duty of the 
respondents to bring on record said Vakalatnama in their evidence as 
onus of proving issue No.2 was placed upon them but none of the 
parties brought the same Vakalatnama on record. In order to reach a 
just conclusion, this Court summoned the original file of suit titled 
“Mst. Hashmat Bibi etc. V. Falak Sher, etc.” wherein said 
Vakalatnama is available. Through said Vakalatnama, petitioners 
engaged Mirza Atta Ullah Qamar Advocate on the following terms:

16. 
Petitioners No.1 & 3 put their thumb impression, whereas, 
petitioners No.2 & 4 made their signatures. Perusal of said 

W.P. No. 3631 of 2015. 
11
Vakalatnama, it appears that neither any authority was given to 
Mirza Atta Ullah Qamar Advocate to make any statement of 
compromise nor permission was given to get decree the suit of the 
respondents on the basis of compromise.  
17. 
There is no evidence on the record to suggest that any 
compromise was affected between the parties. Neither any terms and 
conditions of said compromise were reduced into writing nor 
produced before the Court. During the course of evidence, 
respondents introduced a new story which is quite alien from their 
written reply. They maintained that a murder case was registered 
against them and petitioners No.1 & 3 were witnesses of the said 
case and in the said murder case compromise was affected for 
Rs.10,00,000/- and it was also settled that pre-emption case would 
also be decided on the basis of compromise and Falak Sher etc. 
agreed that they would get record the compromising statement. It is 
further maintained that on the date of hearing Falak Sher etc. 
attended the Court along with their counsel Mirza Atta Ullah Qamar 
Advocate and asked him to get record his statement for decreeing the 
suit on the basis of compromise. Exact deposition of R.W.1 
Muhammad Ramzan (respondent No.2) is as under:

W.P. No. 3631 of 2015.

18. 
First of all, the story brought during the evidence regarding a 
murder case is alien to the written reply of the respondents as there is 
nothing mentioned regarding compromise in the pre-emption case on 
the basis of compromise in a murder case. Hence, story being 
beyond pleadings is not believable.  
19. 
Next version taken during the evidence is that Falak Sher and 
Mirza attended the Court on the fateful day along with their counsel 
Mirza Atta Ullah Qamar Advocate who asked their counsel to get 
record statement regarding compromise. This facts was also not 
pleaded in the written reply by the respondents. Moreover, 
attendance of Falak Sher and Mirza is not reflecting in the order 
dated 22.06.2004 (Exh.A.7).  
20. 
Both the Courts below dismissed the petitioners’ application 
on the ground that it is settled principle of law that every lawyer 
engaged by a party has implied authority to enter into compromise 
even no specific power has been conferred upon him. No doubt, 
through engaging a counsel and by giving him Vakalatnama (power 
of attorney) a party gives him an authorization for doing certain acts 
with regard to the suit. But said authorization was not unqualified 
and unrestricted. The counsel has to work and to act within the scope 
of authority given to him. In this regard, the wording of the power of 
attorney should be strictly construed.  
21. 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case titled as 
“MUHAMMAD AKHTAR versus Mst. MANNA and 3 others” (2001 
SCMR 1700) while describing that the power of attorney must be 
strictly construed observed as under: - 

W.P. No. 3631 of 2015. 
13
 
“It is well settled by now that the power of attorney must be strictly 
construed and it is necessary to show that on a fair construction of the 
whole instrument the authority in question may be found within the four 
corners of the instrument either in express terms or by necessary 
implication.” 
 
Said dictum was endorsed in the case titled “MUHAMMAD 
YASIN and another versus DOST MUHAMMAD through Legal 
Heirs and another” (PLD 2002 SC 71) in following terms: - 
 
“It is also well known principle of law that all such instruments of power 
of attorney in pursuance whereof attorney is authorized to act on behalf 
of principal are to be construed strictly.” 
 
22. 
Power of attorney must be construed strictly as giving only 
such authority as is conferred expressly or by necessary implication 
and it cannot empower beyond what it really conveys and its 
contents must be taken into consideration as a whole. Power of 
attorney only gives that power which is specifically mentioned 
therein.  
23. 
The power of attorney (Vakalatnama) does not confer 
impliedly the power of compromise on the counsel or to make any 
statement to withdraw the suit or to get decree the suit, until and 
unless such powers have been specifically given to the attorney.  
24. 
There is hardly any doubt that if the power to do an act has not 
been specifically given to an attorney, such an act, whether 
compromise or otherwise, is of no legal consequence at the option of 
the concerned party.  
25. 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan while refusing to grant 
leave to appeal in a case titled “MUHAMMAD HUSSAIN AND 

W.P. No. 3631 of 2015. 
14
OTHERS V. MST. HANAF ILAHI AND OTHERS” (2005 SCMR 
1121)  observed as under: 
“The only point involved in this case is, whether the learned 
counsel appearing for respondent No. 1, had the authority to 
withdraw the suit in the circumstances of the case in hand. The 
learned Single Judge of the High Court has dealt with this matter 
in extenso and has come to a definite conclusion that no such 
instructions were ever imparted by the lady to her counsel nor they 
are reflected from the power of attorney executed by her. The 
learned Single Judge, after advancing valid reasons, has exercised 
the discretion properly and no exception can be taken to the 
same.” 
 
 
In another case where the authority of compromise was given 
to the counsel through Vakalatnama declared that said authority was 
neither absolute nor unqualified rather it was conditional with a 
settlement arrived at by the party and while deciding the said case 
titled “ABDUL SHAKOOR AND OTHERS V. HAROON AND 
OTHERS” (2008 SCMR 896), august Supreme Court of Pakistan 
held as under: 
“Though on the Vakalatnama given to Mr. A.P.F. Fances, 
Advocate it was endorsed that "we further authorize our advocate 
to compromise the suit and enter into any settlement arrived at by 
the parties". Though learned counsel appearing on behalf of 
respondents was authorized to compromise the suit on their behalf 
but this authority was neither absolute nor unqualified. In fact it 
was conditioned with a settlement arrived at by the parties. The 
counsel as such could not be deemed to be authorized to enter into 
compromise in relation to the suit without any settlement having 
been arrived at between the parties themselves. The power to 
compound or settle the matter is vested with the parties and 
counsel acts according to the instructions given to him by the party. 
He may enter into compromise only where the Vakalatnama 
empowers him to do so specifically and cannot do so at his own.”

Valuable rights of the parties are involved in the lis, therefore, 
while deciding the case on the basis of compromise, the Court 
should apply maximum care and caution to ascertain that whether the 
parties are agreed to the statement of compromise given by their 
counsel.  
27. 
In the present case, the petitioners engaged Mirza Atta Ullah 
Qamar Advocate to pursue their case diligently and efficiently. They 
never authorized him to make any statement of compromise or to get 
the suit decreed on the basis of compromise. Neither any authority 
through Vakalatnama was given to him to make compromise with the 
opposite party or to get the suit decreed on the basis of compromise, 
therefore, the statement made by the petitioners’ counsel is not 
binding upon them.   
28. 
In view of the above, learned Courts below committed 
illegality while dismissing the application of the petitioners under 
Section 12(2) C.P.C. The Courts below have not applied their 
judicial mind and decided the matter on surmises and conjectures.  
29. 
For the foregoing reasons, this petition is accepted and 
judgments/memos of cost dated 06.10.2012 & 02.05.2015 are set-
aside. Consequently, judgment & decree dated 22.06.2004 is also 
set-aside. The suit would be deemed to be pending before the learned 
Trial Court who shall decide the same expeditiously, preferably 
within a period of 03 months from the receipt of certified copy of 
this judgment, under intimation to this Court through Deputy 
Registrar (Judicial) of this Bench.
