Petitioner being an accused in case FIR 
No.32 Dated 08.02.2023 offences u/ss 302/109/34 
PPC P.S. Sohawa, District Jhelum has challenged 
order 
dated 
23.10.2023 
passed 
by 
learned 
Addl.Sessions Judge, Sohawa/trial Court, whereby 
his application for summoning the record/Rapt with 
Audio recording from the office of Rescue-15 has 
been dismissed. 
2.  
Before going to the merits of the case, it 
would be significant to examine the objective, import 
and powers of the court within meaning of section 
540, Cr.P.C. which is hereby reproduced:- 
“Power to summon material witness or examine persons 
present. Any Court may, at any stage of any inquiry, trial or 
other proceeding under this Code, summon any person as a 
witness, or examine any person in attendance, though not 
summoned as a witness, or recall and re-examine any person 
already examined and the Court shall summon and examine 
or recall and re-examine any such person if his evidence 
appears to it essential to the just decision of the case.”  
 
3.  
Sub-section (1) to section 94 Cr.P.C. for 
reference is also hereby reproduced:- 
“Summons to produce document or other thing. (1) 
Whenever any Court, or any officer in charge of a police 
station considers that the production of any document or 
other thing is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any 
investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this 
Code by or before such Court or officer, such Court may 
issue a summons, or such officer a written order, to the 
person in whose possession or power such document or 
thing is believed to be, requiring him to attend and produce 

Crl. Rev. No.265 of 2023 
                                                        2 
it, or to produce it, at the time and place stated in the 
summons or order……” 
 
4.  
In view of above, any party may at any 
stage of the inquiry or trial apply to the Court, u/s 
94 Cr.P.C., for the production of any document or 
other thing and is entitled to its production, if it 
satisfies the court that the production of that 
document is necessary or desirable for the purposes 
of such inquiry or trial but in present case contents 
of the application of the petitioner do not show that 
production of audio recording under question at 
this stage, when prosecution is leading its evidence, 
is necessary for the purpose of trial.  
5.  
Legislature has provided a mechanism for 
both prosecution and defence (accused) to bring 
their respective evidence including exhibiting of 
document (s). Suffice it to say that the moment 
Court takes cognizance on a criminal charge, it 
becomes obligatory upon the prosecution to prove 
the charge against the accused (denied by the accused) 
well within the meaning of Article 117 of the 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, which is hereby 
reproduced:- 
“Burden of proof. (1) Whoever desires any Court to give 
judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the 
existence of facts which he asserts, must prove that those 
facts exist. 
(2) When a person is bound to prove the existence of any 
fact, it is said that the burden of proof lies on that 
person.”  
 
6.  
In view of above, an accused enjoys the 
status of “innocence” till found guilty by the Court 
on the basis of discharge of such burden by the 
prosecution, nevertheless, if the accused takes a 
particular plea, including plea of alibi the burden is 
upon the accused to prove such plea well within 

Crl. Rev. No.265 of 2023 
                                                        3 
the meaning of Article 119 of Qanun-e-Shahadat 
Order 1984 which is hereby reproduced:- 
“Burden of proof as to particular fact. The burden of 
proof as to any particular fact lies on that person who 
wishes the Court to believe in its existence, unless it is 
provided by any law that the proof of that fact shall lie on 
any particular person.”  
 
 
7.  
The question arises that how and in what 
manner the prosecution has to prove the charge 
and when accused has to step forward to 
discharge his respective burden or cause the dent 
in prosecution case by leading evidence, answer 
thereof is mentioned in sub-sections (1), (2) & (4) 
to section 265-F Cr.P.C. which are hereby 
reproduced:- 
 
“Evidence of Prosecution (1). if the accused does not 
plead guilty or the Court in its discretion does not convict 
him on his plea, the Court shall proceed to hear the 
complainant (if any) and take all such evidence as may be 
produced in support of the prosecution. 
Provided that the Court shall not be bound to hear any 
person as complainant in any case in which the complaint 
has been made by a Court.   
 
(2). The Court shall ascertain from the public prosecutor 
or, as the case may be, from the complainant, the names 
of any persons likely to be acquainted with the facts of the 
case and to be able to give evidence for the prosecution, 
and shall summon such persons to give evidence before it. 
 
(4). When the examination of the witnesses for the 
prosecution and the examination (if any) of the 
accused are concluded, the accused shall be asked 
whether he means to adduce evidence.”  
 
8.  
These provisions make it clear that it is 
the prosecution which has to lead its side first and 
this is so because the burden is upon the 
prosecution to prove its case, only after conclusion 
of prosecution evidence, accused is to be asked 
whether he wants to adduce evidence or not. 
9.  
The sub-section (7) to Section 265-F 
Cr.P.C. guarantees that the accused shall also 
have the same right to examine defence witnesses 
and production of document(s) which is hereby 
reproduced for reference: 

Crl. Rev. No.265 of 2023 
                                                        4 
“(7)If the accused or any one or several accused, after 
entering on his defence, applies to the Court to issue 
any process for compelling the attendance of any 
witness for examination or the production of any 
document or other thing, the Court shall issue such 
process unless it considers that the application is 
made for the purpose of vexation or delay or defeating 
the ends of justice such ground shall be recorded by 
the Court in writing”.  
 
10.  
The provisions of section 265-F Cr.P.C. 
have provided a complete procedure for both; 
prosecution and the accused to examine the 
witnesses and to produce document(s),  since the 
procedure has made it clear that accused shall be 
asked to adduce his evidence after conclusion of 
the prosecution evidence. If accused wants the 
court to summon any person to give evidence or to 
produce any document, he shall have to wait till 
conclusion of the prosecution evidence. 
11.  
In present case, the trial is at the stage of 
prosecution evidence, six prosecution witnesses 
have been recorded but petitioner being an 
accused has not cross-examined any of the PWs 
and moved an application on 10.07.2023 for 
summoning the record/Rapt with Audio recording 
from the office of Rescue-15 stating therein that on 
08.02.2023 
at 
8.05 
a.m. 
Sharjeel 
Kiyani 
(complainant) made a call through his mobile phone 
number 
i.e. 
0310-9555555) 
to 
Rescue-15 
informing the murder of his father. Photocopy of 
the report prepared by Muhammad Afzaal S.I., 
placed at page-13 of this petition shows that on 
08.02.2023 at 8.10 a.m. operator Rescue-15 had 
informed police station that through mobile 
number 0310-9555555 a call was received at 
Rescue-15 with information that dead body of his 
father smeared with blood is lying on the passage 
leading to village Ghorra, police officials be 

Crl. Rev. No.265 of 2023 
                                                        5 
directed 
to 
reach 
the 
place of 
occurrence. 
Whereupon he along with other police officials 
mentioned in the report of Rescue-15 reached the 
place of occurrence. In response, final feedback 
was received at Rescue-15. Office Report in this 
respect has also been placed at page-14 of this 
petition.  
12.  
All this shows that audio call statedly 
made by the complainant in the office of Rescue 15 
has been documented, record of which statedly 
obtained by the petitioner being an accused placed 
at pages 13 & 14 of this petition can be confronted 
to relevant witnesses during cross-examination, if 
so desired. There is no ambiguity that in view of 
provisions of sub-section 7 to section 265-F 
Cr.P.C. (reproduced above), petitioner has the right to 
summon record/relevant witness regarding matter 
in issue but only on his turn i.e. entering on his 
defence and not before this stage.  
13.  
Learned trial court while dismissing the 
application of the petitioner through impugned 
order has rightly observed that application of the 
petitioner is pre-mature, rather same has been 
moved to cause delay in conclusion of trial instead 
of 
cross-examining 
the 
witnesses 
of 
the 
prosecution already recorded discussed above 
which order is neither perverse nor illegal. This 
petition having no merits is dismissed.
