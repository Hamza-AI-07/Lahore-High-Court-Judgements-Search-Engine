MUHAMMAD 
WAHEED 
KHAN, 
J.- 
By 
invoking inherent jurisdiction of this Court in terms of 
Section 561-A Cr.P.C., the petitioner/accused Rana 
Muhammad Yousaf Khan, Advocate has challenged the 
vires of order dated 16.04.2022 passed by the learned 
Magistrate Section 30, Gojra (respondent No.4), wherein, 
application filed by the petitioner under Section 249-A of 
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Cr.P.C) was turned 
down and order dated 15.08.2022, whereby, Criminal 
Revision filed against the order dated 16.04.2022 was 
dismissed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Gojra, 
District T.T.Singh,  (respondent No.3),  who upheld the 
order of learned Judicial Magistrate.  
2.  
Complainant 
namely, 
Sheikh 
Abdul 
Waheed 
(respondent No.2), lodged F.I.R No. 877/2020 dated 

 
 
 
Cr. Misc. No.61551-M of 2022                                                                                     2 
 
 
 
17.10.2020 under Section 25-D of the Telegraph Act 1885, 
at Police Station, City Gojra, District T.T.Singh against the 
petitioner and the trial of above said case is pending 
adjudication before the Court of first instance and during 
trial proceedings petitioner filed an application u/s 249-A 
Cr.P.C. for his acquittal but said forum dismissed his 
application vide order dated 16.04.2022. Said decision was 
challenged by the petitioner before the learned Additional 
Sessions Judge, Gojra, by filing Criminal Revision Petition 
which also met with the same fate vide order dated 
15.08.2022.  
3.  
Learned counsel for the petitioner is not available 
today but the petitioner present in Court, who is also an 
advocate, submits that he is ready to advance arguments 
himself. In support of this petition, the petitioner contends 
that except one Compact Disc (CD) of a Call Data which 
was allegedly procured by the Police vide recovery memo 
dated 19.11.2020, the prosecution is not equipped with any 
other incriminating material/evidence on record. During 
the course of investigation, neither the mobile phone of the 
accused/petitioner from which the call was allegedly made 
nor the mobile phone of the complainant was taken into 
possession by the investigating agency. As far as the 
recovery of Compact Disc (CD) is concerned, the same 
was produced before the Police by one of the prosecution 
witness namely, Kamran son of Muhammad Ashgar and 
admittedly, no forensic report qua the veracity and 
genuineness of said C.D is available on record. Similarly, 
co-accused persons namely Hafiz Muhammad Shafiq and 
Mst. Ghazala Bibi were declared innocent by the Police 
and their innocence by the Police has not been challenged 
by the complainant at any Higher Forum of Police              

 
 
 
Cr. Misc. No.61551-M of 2022                                                                                     3 
 
 
 
hierarchy; petitioner lastly submits that since the charge 
against him is groundless and there is no probability of his 
conviction in any manner, so, by accepting instant petition, 
he be acquitted of the charge.  
4. 
On the other hand, learned Law Officer assisted by 
the learned counsel for the complainant has candidly 
admitted that except Compact Disc (CD) the memo of 
which is annexed with this petition at Page No.36, there is 
no other incriminating evidence available with the 
prosecution and also admitted that said C.D has not been 
forensically got analyzed/tested by the Police. It was 
further apprised to the Court that report u/s 173 Cr.P.C. 
against the petitioner is pending adjudication for the last 
about two years in which not a single witness has been 
recorded by the prosecution so far.  
5. 
I have heard the petitioner in person as well as 
learned Law Officer assisted by learned counsel for the 
complainant and have gone through the available record 
with their assistance and noticed that petitioner had 
basically sought his acquittal from the learned Trial Court 
u/s 249-A Cr.P.C. For ready reference Section 249-A is 
reproduced as under:-      
249-A. Power of Magistrate to acquit accused at 
any stage: Nothing in this Chapter shall be deemed 
to prevent a Magistrate from acquitting an accused 
at any stage of the case if after hearing the 
prosecutor and the accused and for reasons to be 
recorded, he considers that the charge is groundless 
or that there is no probability of the accused being 
convicted of any offence. 
 
On going through the above provision of law, it is clear 
that no embargo has been imposed upon the accused to file 
such application seeking his acquittal at any stage of the         

 
 
 
Cr. Misc. No.61551-M of 2022                                                                                     4 
 
 
 
case and only certain conditions have been described 
therein, firstly, that the Court has to give the right of 
hearing to the prosecutor and the accused and if reaches to 
the conclusion that the charge against the accused is 
groundless or there is no probability of accused being 
convicted of any offence, he shall be acquitted of the 
charge through an order in which such reasons have to be 
recorded for reaching to the conclusion that charge(s) 
against the accused is/are baseless. There is no cavil with 
the proposition that powers under Sections 249-A and 265-
K Cr.P.C available to the learned Trial Court are similar to 
powers of High Court u/s 561-A of Cr.P.C.  
6. 
As observed in this case, the charge against the 
petitioner was that he extended threats of dire 
consequences from his cell No.0302-7004605 at the 
mobile 
phone 
of 
complainant 
0309-9107899 
but 
admittedly, neither cell phone or its Subscriber Identity 
Module (SIM) nor the mobile phone of the complainant 
was taken into possession by the Investigating Agency 
during the course of investigation. Sole reliance of the 
prosecution in this case is, on the audio C.D allegedly 
prepared by above said Kamran. The relevant provision 
regarding evidence prepared through modern devices is 
Article 164 of QANUN-E-SHAHADAT ORDER, 1984 
which is reproduced for ready reference;-  
164. Production of evidence that has become 
available because of modern devices, etc.: In such 
cases as the Court may consider appropriate, the 
Court may allow to be produced any evidence that 
may have become available because of modern 
devices or techniques. 
 
However, in the light of Article 164 supra the august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in case of “ISHTIAQ AHMED 

 
 
 
Cr. Misc. No.61551-M of 2022                                                                                     5 
 
 
 
MIRZA and 2 others versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN 
and others” (PLD 2019 Supreme Court 675), has laid 
down the following criteria regarding admissibility of an 
audio tape or video in evidence before a Court of law and 
the mode and manner of proving same before the Court:  
(i) 
No audio tape or video could be relied upon by a 
court until the same was proved to be genuine and not 
tampered with or doctored.  
(ii) 
A forensic report prepared by an analyst of the 
Provincial Forensic Science Agency in respect of an 
audio tape or video was per se admissible in evidence 
in view of the provisions of section 9(3) of the Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency Act, 2007.  
(iii) 
Under Article 164 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 
1984 it laid in the discretion of a court to allow any

Even where a court allowed an audio tape or video to 
be produced in evidence, such audio tape or video 
had to be provided in accordance with the law of

evidence must be the actual record of the 
conversation as and when it was made or of the event 
as and when it took place.  
(vii) 
The person recording the conversation or event had 
to be produced.  
(viii) The person recording the conversation or event must

identify the voice of the person speaking or the person 
seen or the voice or person seen may be identified by 
any other person who recognized such voice or 
person.  
(xii) 
Any other person present at the time of making of the 
conversation or taking place of the event may also 
testify in support of the conversation heard in the 
audio tape or the event shown in the video.

Cr. Misc. No.61551-M of 2022                                                                                     6 
 
 
 
(xv) 
Safe custody of the audio tape or video after its 
preparation till production before the court must be 
proved.  
(xvi) 
The transcript of the audio tape or video must have 
been prepared under independent supervision and

the purpose of laying a trap to procure evidence.  
(xviii) The source of an audio tape or video becoming 
available had to be disclosed.  
(xix) 
The date of acquiring the audio tape or video by the 
person producing it before the Court ought to be

(xx) 
An audio tape or video produced at a late stage of a 
judicial proceeding may be looked at with suspicion.  
(xxi) 
A formal application had to be filed before the Court 
by the person desiring an audio tape or video to be 
brought on the record of the case as evidence.  
 
In another celebrated judgment of the august Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in case of “Member (Administration), 
Federal Board of Revenue and others versus Mian Khan” 
(PLD 2021 SCMR 1077), the Apex Court through its 
esteemed judgment has observed as following:- 
“It is an admitted fact that no regular inquiry was conducted 
by the petitioner Department and the same was dispensed 
with on the ground that the other evidence in the shape of 
CCTV footage is so authentic that major penalty can be 
imposed upon the respondent in the absence of regular 
inquiry and while imposing the major penalty CCTV footage 
was made the sole criterion to proceed against the 
respondent. It is an apathy that the said CCTV footage was 
never sent to the office of Forensic Science Laboratory for its 
authenticity. In the absence of any forensic report qua the 
authenticity of the CCTV footage, the same cannot be 
considered a legal basis for proceeding against a person. In 
the case of Ishtiaq Ahmed Mirza v. Federation of Pakistan 
(PLD 2019 SC 675) this Court has held that with the 
advancement of science and technology, it is now possible to 
get a forensic examination, audit or test conducted through 
an appropriate laboratory so as to get it ascertained as to 
whether an audio tape or a video is genuine or not and as 
such or video has been edited, doctored or tampered with or 
not because advancement of science and technology has also 
made it very convenient and easy to edit, doctor, superimpose 
or Photoshop a voice or picture in an audio tape or video, 
therefore, without a forensic examination, audit or test, it is 
becoming more and more unsafe to rely upon the same as a 
piece of evidence in a court of law. We have noticed that the 

 
 
 
Cr. Misc. No.61551-M of 2022                                                                                     7 
 
 
 
CCTV footage was even not produced before the learned 
Federal Service Tribunal. Even otherwise, mere producing of 
CCTV footage as a piece of evidence without any forensic 
test is not sufficient to be relied upon unless and until 
corroborated and proved to be genuine. The passengers, who 
allegedly gave the bribe, had also not been associated with 
the departmental proceedings. No question of law of public 
importance within the meaning of Article 212(3) of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, has been 
raised either in this petition to warrant interference by this 
Court.    
 
 7.  
After going through the ‘memo of possession’ of 
audio C.D, it is noticed that same was prepared by one 
Kamran, a witness of the case, after copying the audio 
from the mobile phone of the complainant while pasting 
the same at the C.D. Since the C.D was prepared after 
copying the original voice from the mobile phone, it loses 
its authenticity because the same was not the original 
device where the voice of the accused was recorded. 
Moreover, it was not provided by the complainant to the 
police rather by the afore-said witness after copying the 
same from the mobile phone of the complainant. Thus, the 
preparation of this C.D, in any way, does not fulfill the 
criteria as provided by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the afore referred judgments. The best course 
in this case could be that the Police should have taken into 
possession the mobile phone of the complainant on which 
the threatening call was received and got it forensically 
tested 
after 
comparing 
with 
the 
voice 
of 
the 
petitioner/accused but this attempt was not made by the 
Investigating Agency to reach some proper conclusion. In 
my view, this evidence, i.e, the Compact Disc having 
audio cannot be used against the petitioner as the same was 
not prepared/generated in view of the parameters as 
mentioned above in the afore-referred judgments.    
 

 
 
 
Cr. Misc. No.61551-M of 2022                                                                                     8 
 
 
 
 
8.  
The other aspect of the case is that according to the 
contents of F.I.R, co-accused Hafiz Muhammad Shafiq, 
clerk of accused Muhammad Yousaf, Advocate, also 
allegedly extended threats of dire consequences to the 
complainant by using his mobile Phone No.0300-6683182. 
Similarly, co-accused Mst. Ghazala also extended threats 
and also called his name/abused the complainant. These 
two co-accused persons were declared as innocent by the 
Police and learned Law Officer assisted by learned counsel 
for the complainant frankly, admitted that these findings of 
the Police had never been challenged by the complainant at 
any higher forum of Police hierarchy.    
9.  
So, for the reasons discussed supra, it is manifestly 
clear that the charges levelled against the petitioner by 
respondent No.2 Sheikh Abdul Waheed are groundless and 
analyzing and viewing the incriminating evidence/material, 
allegedly with which prosecution is equipped, there is no 
probability of the petitioner/accused being convicted. Now 
if the trial is allowed to proceed further that would be 
travesty of justice, sheer mis-use of process of law and 
wastage of precious time of Court as the petitioner has 
already suffered rigours and agony of protracted 
investigation and trial, since lodging of the F.I.R in 
question, which had been lodged on 17.10.2020. 
Resultantly, 
while 
exercising 
inherent 
jurisdiction 
conferred upon this Court u/s 561-A Cr.P.C, this petition is 
allowed and the order of the learned Magistrate dated 
16.04.2022 to the extent of dismissing the application of 
the petitioner under Section 249-A Cr.P.C and judgment 
dated 15.08.2022 of the learned Additional Sessions Judge, 
Gojra, District T.T.Singh in Criminal Revision Petition are

set aside and petition filed by the petitioner u/s 249-A 
Cr.P.C is allowed and trial proceedings before learned 
Trial Court are hereby quashed and the petitioner 
Muhammad Yousaf is acquitted of the charge.
