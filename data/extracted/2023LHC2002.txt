3. 
Precisely, the necessary facts of the prosecution case, as narrated by Habib-
ur-Rehman (PW-5) , the complainant of the case are as under:- 
              “Stated that on 07.11.2019, at about 08.30 am, my brother Abdul 
Majeed deceased was injured by Khuda Bakhsh, Mohammad Zafar and two 
unknown persons, at this, my brother got lodged ruppat No.8, dated 
07.11.2019. At about 11.10 am on the same day, then injured Abdul Majeed 
was brought to Police Khidmat Center, THQ Khairpur and lodged ruppat by 
stating that he was resident of Mouza Ghanipur and labouer by profession. On 
that day, at about 08.30 am. he was standing in front of his house, meanwhile, 
Khuda Bakhsh s/o Abdul Ghafoor, caste Pawli r/o Basti Sultan Arain came 
there and started to abuse him, when he/deceased forbade him. Khuda Bakhsh 
accused flared up and started to give slaps and fists to the deceased Abdul 
Majeed (then injured). The accused gave fist blow on his left cheek and in the 
meanwhile, Mohammad Zafar accused came to help Khuda Bakhsh accused 
alongwith two unknown accused persons. Mohammad Zafar accused having a 
Soti in his hand, inflicted Soti blow on the Dola of left arm of Abdul Majeed, 
Khuda Bakhsh accused inflicted Soti blow to Abdul Majeed (deceased) on his 
right knee joint, Mohammad Zafar accused again caused Soti blow on left knee 
of Abdul Majeed. Khuda Bakhsh accused again gave Soti blow on left ankle 
of the deceased. Unknown accused persons also made kicks and fist blows to 
Abdul Majeed deceased. On hue and cry of Abdul Majeed, PWs Mohammad 
Bashir s/o Allah Bakhsh, Mohammad Sajjad s/o Noor Mohammad arrived 
there who witnessed the occurrence and rescued Abdul Majeed (since 
deceased) from the clutches of accused persons 
 
 
 
Motive behind the occurrence was that accused persons have dispute 
with close relatives of Abdul Majeed since deceased because Abdul Majeed 
deceased divorced his wife Mst Haseena Mai sister of accused Khuda Bakhsh 
and Muhammad  Zafar about 08 days prior to the occurrence, the reason behind 
that the accused with intention to commit Qatal-i-Amd of Abdul Majeed 
deceased, caused severe injuries on his person and done him to death (The then 
injured Abdul Majeed went to THQ Hospital Khairpur Tamewali alongwith 
me and got recorded his statement which was verified by the Incharge Police 
Khidmat Counter, THQ Hospital, Khairpur Tamewali. The injured (since 
deceased) was medically examined by the Hospital of THQ KPT and then, he 
was referred to B.V.H. Bahawalpur. On 10.11.2019. the then injured Abdul 
Majeed succumbed to the injuries at B.V.H. Bahawalpur. The Police of P.S. 
Khairpur Tamewali came B.V.H. Bahawalpur, where, I submitted written

application Ex.PE which bear my signature and thumb-impression and on the 
said written application, FIR was registered I also stated before the Police 
according to my application Ex.PE that Khuda Bakhsh accused, at the time of 
causing injuries to Abdul Majeed deceased, also caused injury to the deceased 
with the leg of cot (Paya) on the backside of his head and he also caused injury 
to Abdul Majeed deceased on his right shoulder, but these two injuries were 
not written by the Police in ruppat got recorded on the statement of the 
deceased 
 
 
After that, the police of P.S. Khairpur Tamewali escorted the dead body 
of Abdul Majeed deceased to THQ Hospital, Khairpur Tamewali and handed 
over the dead body of the deceased to the Doctor for autopsy examination. I 
alongwith Bashir Ahmad and Mohammad Sajjad were alongwith the dead 
body of the deceased Abdul Majeed. After handing over the dead body to the 
Doctor for autopsy, the 1.0. came at the spot alongwith me as well as 
Mohammad Sajjad and Bashir Ahmad, where, the 1.O. inspected the place of 
occurrence. At the place of occurrence, I produced leg of cot P-1 which was 
burnt from one side i.e. weapon of offence before the IO. who took the same 
into possession vide recovery memo Ex.PF, attested by me, Mohammad Bashir 
and Mohammad Sajjad PWS. The 1.0. also recorded my statement and the 
statements of PWs in this regard. After post-mortem examination, I received 
the dead body of my deceased brother Abdul Majeed and I affixed my thumb- 
impression on the receipt Ex.PG, as a token of its correctness.” 
 
4.     After the formal investigation of the case report under section 173 of the Code 
of Criminal Procedure, 1898 was submitted before the learned trial court and the 
accused were sent to face trial. The learned trial court framed the charge against the 
accused on 30.01.2020, to which the accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. 
 
5. 
The prosecution in order to prove its case got statements of as many as ten 
witnesses recorded. The ocular account of the case was furnished by Habib-ur-
Rehman (PW-5) and Muhammad Bashir (PW-6) .  Muhammad Nawaz, ASI (PW-3) 
stated that on 10.11.2019, he got recorded the formal F.I.R (Exh.PD). Shafqat 
Mahmood 1023/HC (PW-4) stated that on 10.11.2019, he received a stump of cot 
from the Investigating Officer of the case and on 17.11.2019, the Investigating

Officer of the case handed over to him the last worn clothes of deceased and on 
24.11.2019, the Investigating Officer of the case handed over to him two Sotis

identified the dead body of the deceased at the time of its post mortem examination 
and on 17.11.2019, Nabi Ahmad 983/C handed over the last worn clothes of the

and detailed the facts of the investigation as conducted by him  in his statement 
before the learned trial court.

07.11.2019 was posted as Medical Officer at THQ hospital ,Khairpur Tamewali and 
on the same day, examined Abdul Majeed son of Ghulam Qadir ( the then injured

7.    
On 01.03.2021, the learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor gave up the 
prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Sajjad and Muhammad Asif as being 
unnecessary and closed the prosecution evidence after tendering in evidence the 
reports of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh. P.Q. and Exh. P.R). 
 
8. 
After the closure of prosecution evidence, the learned trial court examined the 
appellants namely Khuda Bakhsh son of Ghafoor Ahmed and Muhammad Zafar 
Iqbal son of Ghafoor Ahmed  under section 342 Cr.P.C. and in answer to the question 
why this case against you and why the P.W.s have deposed against you, they replied 
that they  had been involved in the case falsely and were innocent. The appellants 
namely Khuda Bakhsh son of Ghafoor Ahmed and Muhammad Zafar Iqbal son of 
Ghafoor Ahmed , opted not to get themselves examined under section 340(2) Cr.P.C. 
and did not adduce any  evidence in their defence.

9. 
At the conclusion of the trial, the learned Additional Sessions Judge/Model 
Criminal Trial Court Bahawalpur convicted and sentenced the appellants as referred 
to above.   
 
10. 
The contention of the learned counsel for the appellants precisely is that the 
whole case is fabricated and false and the prosecution remained unable to prove the 
facts in issue and did not produce any unimpeachable, admissible, and relevant 
evidence. Learned counsel for the appellant further contended that the story of the 
prosecution mentioned in the statements of the witnesses, on the face of it, was 
highly improbable. Learned counsel for the appellant further contended that the 
statements of the prosecution witnesses were not worthy of any reliance. The learned 
counsel for the appellant also submitted that the recovery of the Soti  (P-2) from the 
appellant namely  Khuda Bakhsh son of Ghafoor Ahmed and the recovery of the Soti 
(P-3) from the appellant namely Muhammad Zafar Iqbal son of Ghafoor Ahmed  
were full of procedural defects, of no legal worth and value, and were result of fake 
proceedings. The learned counsel for the appellants also argued that the appellants 
had been involved in the occurrence only on suspicion. The learned counsels for the 
appellants finally submitted that the prosecution had totally failed to prove the case 
against the accused beyond the shadow of a doubt.   
 
11. 
On the other hand, the learned Deputy Prosecutor General along with the 
learned counsel for the complainant, contended that the prosecution has proved its 
case beyond the shadow of doubt by producing independent witnesses. The learned 
Deputy Prosecutor General along with the learned counsel for the complainant, 
further argued that the deceased died as a result of injuries suffered at the hands of 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 244 of 2021 
Criminal Revision    No. 166 of 2021 
 
 
10 
 
the appellants namely Khuda Bakhsh son of Ghafoor Ahmed and Muhammad Zafar 
son of  Ghafoor Ahmad. The learned Deputy Prosecutor General along with the 
learned counsel for the complainant, further contended that the medical evidence 
also corroborated the statements of the eye witnesses. The learned Deputy 
Prosecutor General along with the learned counsel for the complainant, further 
argued that the recovery of the Soti  (P-2) from the appellant namely  Khuda Bakhsh 
son of Ghafoor Ahmed and the recovery of the Soti (P-3) from the appellant namely 
Muhammad Zafar Iqbal son of Ghafoor Ahmed also corroborated the ocular account. 
The learned Deputy Prosecutor General along with the learned counsel for the 
complainant, further contended that there was no occasion for the prosecution 
witnesses, who were related to the deceased, to substitute the real offenders with the 
innocent in this case. Lastly, the learned Deputy Prosecutor General along with the 
learned counsel for the complainant prayed for the rejection of the appeals.  
 
12. 
We have heard the learned counsels for the appellant, the learned counsel for 
the complainant, the learned Deputy Prosecutor General and perused the record with 
their able assistance. 
 
13. 
At the very outset, we have noticed a bludgeoning flaw in the statement of the 
prosecution witness namely Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5). We have reproduced the 
examination in-chief of the prosecution witness namely Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5)  
as recorded by the learned trial court in paragraph 3 of the judgment and a bare 
perusal of the same reveals that the prosecution witness namely Habib-ur-Rehman 
(PW-5) never claimed to be an eye witness of the occurrence and while getting  the 
examination in-chief before the learned trial court , which has been reproduced by 
us in paragraph 3 of the judgment, the prosecution witness namely Habib-ur-Rehman 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 244 of 2021 
Criminal Revision    No. 166 of 2021 
 
 
11 
 
(PW-5) only narrated the account of the occurrence as recorded in the Rapt No.8 
dated 07.11.2019, which Rapt No.8 was recorded allegedly on the basis of the 
statement made by Abdul Majeed (deceased) himself. The learned counsel for the 
complainant has candidly conceded that a perusal of the examination in-chief of the 
prosecution witness namely Habib-ur-Rehman , as recorded by the learned trial 
court, made it apparent that the prosecution witness namely Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-
5) never gave any evidence that he himself was present at the place of occurrence 
and had witnessed the same. The prosecution witness namely Habib-ur-Rehman 
(PW-5) also admitted himself that according to the narrative of the Rapt No.8, which 
was recorded allegedly on the basis of the statement made by Abdul Majeed 
(deceased) himself, the prosecution witness namely Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5) had 
not been mentioned as a witness who was present at the place of occurrence or had 
indeed witnessed the same.  During cross-examination Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5), 
admitted as under:- 
“I was not cited as witness in ruppat incorporated on the statement of Abdul 
Majeed. Volunteered that at the time of recording above said ruppat, 1 was present 
there 
I did not inform the police about the occurrence. Volunteered that the said 
information was laid down before the Police by Imran and Rashid. Said Imran is my 
Mulair and Rashid is my nephew.” (emphasis supplied)  
Similarly, Muhammad Siddique, SI (PW-8), Investigating Officer of the case , also 
admitted that according to the written application (Exh.PE)  submitted by the 
prosecution witness namely Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5) for the registration of the 
F.I.R on 10.11.2019, Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5) had not claimed himself to be an 
eye witness of the occurrence . Muhammad Siddique, SI (PW-8) during cross-
examination , stated as under:- 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 244 of 2021 
Criminal Revision    No. 166 of 2021 
 
 
12 
 
“According to complaint Ex.PE, complainant did not himself claim to be eye-
witness of the occurrence. ” 
Even the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Bashir (PW-6) did not state that 
at the time of occurrence, the prosecution witness namely Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-
5) was present at the place of occurrence or had been attracted to the place of 
occurrence , rather stated that only he and Muhammad Sajjad (given up prosecution 
witness)  were attracted to the place of occurrence. In view of the above discussion 
of the prosecution evidence, it is more than apparent that the prosecution witness 
namely Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5) had not witnessed the occurrence and was not 
present at the place of occurrence, at the time of occurrence. It is also proved on 
record that whatever was stated by the prosecution witness namely Habib-ur-
Rehman (PW-5) in his statement before the learned trial court ,regarding the facts of 
the occurrence, was based on the information he had recovered from the perusal of 
Rapt No.8 (Exh.PE/1) and  he himself was not a witness of whatever was narrated 
in the Rapt No.8 (Exh.PE/1). Therefore, the evidence of the prosecution witness 
namely Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5) does not prove any fact in issue relevant in the 
case.  
14. 
The prosecution also got recorded the statement of Muhammad Bashir (PW-
6) who claimed to had witnessed the occurrence. The deceased namely Abdul 
Majeed was closely related to the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Bashir 
(PW-6) and the said relationship has been brought on record. According to the 
prosecution witness namely Muhammad Bashir (PW-6) himself, the deceased as 
well as Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5) were his maternal cousins.  Muhammad Bashir 
(PW-6) during cross-examination also claimed that his house was at a distance of 
only 2-3 houses from the house of the deceased , in front of which house the 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 244 of 2021 
Criminal Revision    No. 166 of 2021 
 
 
13 
 
occurrence had taken place. Muhammad Bashir (PW-6) during cross-examination , 
stated as under:- 
“Complainant Habib ur Rehman is my maternal cousin (Phophu-Zad). My house 
is at a distance of 02/03 houses from the house of Abdul Majeed.” 
A perusal of the prosecution evidence itself reveals that this claim of the prosecution 
witness namely Muhammad Bashir (PW-6) that his house was at a distance of only 
2-3 houses from the house of the deceased , in front of which house the occurrence 
had taken place, was not correct. We have perused the rough site plan of the place 
of occurrence (Exh.PM) as prepared by the Muhammad Siddique, SI (PW-8) , the 
Investigating Officer of the case , as well as the scaled site plan of the place of 
occurrence (Exh.PP) as prepared by the Ghulam Qadir, Patwari (PW-10) and find 
that though in both the site plans of the place of occurrence (Exh.PM and Exh.PP), 
one house of one Muhammad Arshad Maitla has been shown to be present towards 
the southern side of the house of the deceased, whereas it has been mentioned that 
on the eastern side of the house of the deceased , a cattle shed had been made by one 
Muhammad Arshad Maitla , whereas on the northern and  western sides of the house 
of the deceased  there was vacant land, however, the house of Muhammad Bashir 
(PW-6) has not been shown in the same. Then the prosecution witness namely 
Muhammad Bashir (PW-6) also did not give any reason for his presence at the place 
of occurrence.  In this manner, the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Bashir 
(PW-6)  can be validly termed as a “chance witness” and therefore was under a 
bounden duty to provide a convincing reason for his presence at the place of 
occurrence, at the time of occurrence and was also under a duty to prove his presence 
by producing some physical proof of the same. We have noted with grave concern 
that the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Bashir (PW-6)  failed miserably to 
provide any consistent evidence as to the reason for his arrival at the place of 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 244 of 2021 
Criminal Revision    No. 166 of 2021 
 
 
14 
 
occurrence and his presence at the place of occurrence , when the same was taking 
place, denuding the fact that Muhammad Bashir (PW-6) had indeed not witnessed 
the occurrence.   
15.     We have also noted that both the prosecution witnesses namely Habib-ur-
Rehman (PW-5) and Muhammad Bashir (PW-6)  admitted that though the 
occurrence had taken place on 07.11.2019 at about 08.30 a.m., however, they neither 
themselves reported the matter to the police nor got recorded their statements till 
10.11.2019, i.e after as many as three days of the occurrence. The prosecution 
witness namely Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5) stated that he submitted the written 
application (Exh.PE) to Muhammad Siddique, SI (PW-8) at BV hospital on 
10.11.2019, whereas the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Bashir (PW-6) 
stated that he got recorded his statement to the police only on 10.11.2019. The 
prosecution witness namely Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5) also admitted that prior to 
submitting the written application (Exh.PE) on 10.11.2019, he had also visited the 
Police Station , however, still did not make any statement with regard to the 
occurrence. Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5) , during cross-examination , stated as under:- 
“I had obtained the copy of ruppat incorporated on the complaint of Abdul Majeed 
one day prior to submission of complaint Ex.PE. I did not make any statement prior 
to submission of complaint Ex.PE. After the occurrence, I firstly visited the 
police station, one day prior to submission complaint Ex.PE, however, I cannot 
tell the time of my visit to the police station on that day. 
……………… 
No statement of any PW as well as that of mine was reduced into writing by the 
Police prior to submission of complaint ExPE” (emphasis supplied)

As mentioned above, Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5) also admitted during cross-
examination that he did not inform the police about the occurrence rather the said 
information was given to the police authorities by Imran and Rashid, Imran being 
the cousin of Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5) and Rashid being his nephew. Similarly, the 
prosecution witness namely Muhammad Bashir (PW-6) also admitted to not having 
visited the Police Station after the occurrence nor reporting the matter to the police 
till 10.11.2019, the date upon which the statement under section 161 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1898 of Muhammad Bashir (PW-6) was recorded, three days 
after the occurrence. Muhammad Bashir (PW-6) , during cross-examination , stated 
as under:- 
“ I did not visit police station prior to death of Abdul Majeed. I did not inform the 
police about the occurrence. Volunteered that occurrence was informed by the 
persons standing there. Imran and Rashid conveyed the information to police. 
…………. 
My statement was recorded by the police on 10.11.2019 and my no statement was 
recorded by the police prior to that.”(emphasis supplied)  
Muhammad Siddique, SI (PW-8) , the Investigating Officer of the case , also 
admitted that before 10.11.2019 i.e three days after the occurrence, no information 
was given to the police regarding the occurrence. Muhammad Siddique, SI (PW-8) 
during cross-examination , stated as under:- 
“ Prior to 10.11.2019, I did not receive any information about the instant 
occurrence” 
Both the prosecution witnesses namely Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5) and Muhammad 
Bashir (PW-6) admittedly did not provide any reason for not getting their statements 
recorded with promptitude and why the matter was delayed by them. This delay in 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 244 of 2021 
Criminal Revision    No. 166 of 2021

getting their statements recorded to the police clearly proves the fact that both the 
prosecution witnesses namely Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5) and Muhammad Bashir 
(PW-6) were not present at the place of occurrence, at the time of occurrence. It is 
trite that the delayed recording of the statement of a prosecution witness under 
section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 reduces its value to nothing 
unless there is plausible explanation for such delay. No explanation, much less 
plausible, has been given by the prosecution witness  namely Habib-ur-Rehman 
(PW-5) for not submitting the written application (Exh.PE) earlier or by the 
prosecution witness  namely Muhammad Bashir (PW-6) for him not getting his 
statement under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 recorded 
immediately or not reporting the matter to the police for three days and therefore no 
value can be attached to the statements of the prosecution witnesses namely Habib-
ur-Rehman (PW-5) and Muhammad Bashir (PW-6)  . The august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the case of “Abdul Khaliq Vs. The State” (1996 SCMR 1553) has held 
as under: 
“It is a settled position of law that late recording of 161, Cr.P.C. statement 
of a prosecution witness reduces its value to nill unless there is plausible 
explanation for such delay”.  
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Muhammad Khan Vs. Maula 
Bakhsh” (1998 SCMR 570) has held as under: 
“It is a settled law that credibility of a witness is looked with serious 
suspicion if his statement under section 161, Cr.P.C is recorded with delay 
without offering any plausible explanation”.  
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Syed Saeed Muhammad Shah 
and another Vs. The State” (1993 SCMR 550) at page 571 has held as under: 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 244 of 2021 
Criminal Revision    No. 166 of 2021 
 
 
17 
 
“In the absence of satisfactory nature of explanation normally rule is that 
statements recorded by police after delay and without explanation are to be 
ruled out of consideration. In this case unsatisfactory explanation which is 
not substantiated can be equated with no explanation”.  
 
16. 
We have also noted that the alleged eye witnesses namely Muhammad Bashir 
(PW-6)  and Muhammad Sajjad (given  up prosecution witness) made no effort either 
to save the deceased or to apprehend the accused when they were two in number and 
could have easily restrained the accused. It is unnatural and unbelievable that the 
alleged eye witnesses namely Muhammad Bashir (PW-6)  and Muhammad Sajjad 
(given  up prosecution witness), did not even move a limb to protect their near and 
dear one. The alleged eye witnesses namely Muhammad Bashir (PW-6)  and 
Muhammad Sajjad (given  up prosecution witness), also allowed the appellants to 
escape from the place of occurrence . No person having ordinary prudence would 
believe that such closely related witnesses would remain watching the proceedings 
as mere spectators for as long as the occurrence continued without doing anything 
to rescue the deceased or to apprehend the assailant. It only proves that the deceased 
was at the mercy of the assailant and no one was there to save him. Such behaviour, 
on the part of the witnesses, runs counter to natural human conduct and behaviour. 
Article 129 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 allows the courts to presume the 
existence of any fact, which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to 
the common course of natural events and human conduct in relation to the facts of 
the particular case. We thus trust the existence of this fact, by virtue of the Article 
129 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, that the conduct of the witnesses, as deposed 
by them, was opposed to the common course of natural events, human conduct and 
that the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Bashir (PW-6) was not present at

the place of occurrence, at the time of occurrence. The august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan has enunciated binding principles for appreciation of evidence in such 
circumstances. Reliance is placed on the case of “Zulifqar Ali v. The State” (2021 S 
C M R 1373) wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan observed as under:- 
“Though the human response/reaction, in a sudden crisis, particularly one 
striking awe and terror, cannot be gauged or assessed with any degree of 
empirical certainty as fear impacts differently upon faculties of the onlookers, 
nonetheless, despite maximum latitude, in the given scenario, it really appears 
hard for the appellant who operated with impunity in the face of heavy presence 
of the witnesses; deceased being herself "a young female with average-built" could 
not be expected a static target offering no resistance. Razor (P-13), commonly 
used by the barbers, given its moving handle instead of a fixed grip, is an 
instrument to be managed with some difficultly against a moving object; it risks 
the handler more than the intended target and as such unless the victim is stunned 
as a stone, a possibility beyond contemplation for the witnesses standing nearby 
to foil the attempt; they included three able-bodied males in their youth; their 
inaction is mindboggling and explanation far from being plausible, circumstances 
that in retrospect insinuate their absence at the scene” 
Reliance is placed on the case of “Pathan v. The State” (2015 SCMR 315) at page 
317 wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan observed as under:- 
“The causing of such large number of injuries one after another to the deceased 
with scissors must have consumed reasonable time due to the pause in between the 
first injury and the last one but all the three P.Ws. including the son with a strong 
stature and built remained as silent spectators. They did not react or showed any 
response when the accused was causing the injuries. No man on the earth would 
believe that a close relative would remain silent spectator in a situation like this 
because their intervention was very natural to rescue the deceased but they did 
nothing nor attempted to chase the accused and apprehend him at the spot.” 
Further reliance is placed on the case of “Shahzad Tanveer v. The State” (2012 
SCMR 172) at page-176 wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan observed as 
infra:- 
“It is also more strange that none of the P.Ws. dared to physically intervene in 
order to save the victim or apprehend the accused at the spot.”  
Reliance is also placed on the case of “Liaquat Ali v. The State” (2008 SCMR 95) 
at page 97 wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan observed as under: 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 244 of 2021 
Criminal Revision    No. 166 of 2021 
 
 
19 
 
“He was a single alleged assailant and if the witnesses were there at the spot they 
could have easily overpowered him. This makes their presence at the spot 
doubtful.”  
 
17.      Another aspect of the case raising doubt over prosecution case, is the fact the 
matter was reported to the police on 10.11.2019 at 09.00 p.m.,  when the prosecution 
witness namely Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5)  submitted the written application 
(Exh.PE) to  Muhammad Siddique, SI (PW-8) , the Investigating Officer of the case, 
whereas the occurrence had taken place on 07.11.2019 at 08.30 a.m. In this manner, 
the delay in reporting the matter to the police was of about three days and twelve 
hours, for which delay no reason, much less plausible, was offered. Habib-ur-
Rehman (PW-5) admitted during cross-examination that the Police Station was 
situated just seven kilometres from the place of occurrence and was accessible 
through the same road, which road also linked the hospital where Abdul Majeed 
(deceased) was taken, however, still no effort was made to report the matter to the 
police. Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5) , during cross-examination , stated as under:- 
“We shifted Abdul Majeed to Hospital after 01-½  to 02 hours of decamping of 
accused from the place of occurrence, on a car of someone.  
………….. 
Police Station falls on the way to the Hospital from the place of occurrence The 
Police Station is situated at a distance of 07/08 K.M. from our house. ” 
 No justification, much less credible, has been given by the prosecution at any stage 
for such deferral in reporting the matter to the police and the delay in submitting the 
written application  (Exh. P.E.) by Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5)  to Muhammad 
Siddique, SI (PW-8) . As mentioned above, the prosecution witnesses namely Habib-
ur-Rehman (PW-5) and Muhammad Bashir (PW-6) both candidly admitted that they 
never reported the matter to the police for as many as three days.  It has also been 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 244 of 2021 
Criminal Revision    No. 166 of 2021

claimed by the  prosecution witness namely Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5) that a Rapt 
No.8 was recorded on the statement of Abdul Majeed (deceased)  on 07.11.2019, 
however, Muhammad Siddique, SI (PW-8) , the Investigating Officer of the case , 
admitted that  he did not procure any record of the said Rapt during the investigation  
of the case nor  any information was  received by him regarding the occurrence prior 
to 10.11.02019 nor he recorded the statement of any police official who had recorded 
the said Rapt No.8. Muhammad Siddique, SI (PW-8) , the Investigating Officer of 
the case , admitted during cross-examination , as under:- 
“ Complainant did not produce ruppat Roznamcha before me did not take into 
possession said ruppat in my whole proceedings. Prior to 10.11.2019, I did not 
receive any information about the instant occurrence. The name of official is 
not mentioned who incorporated the said ruppat.” (emphasis supplied) 
 In this case, the ocular account furnished is suffering from legal and factual 
infirmities and does not appeal to a prudent mind, much less a legal one, because the 
witnesses never reported the matter to the police for as many as three days and twelve 
hours. This inordinate delay in reporting the matter conclusively proves that the 
written application   (Exh. P.E.) submitted by Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5)  and the 
formal F.I.R (Exh.PD) were prepared after probe, consultation, planning, 
investigation and discussion . As many as three days and twelve hours were taken to 
invent a false and dishonest narrative of the written application  (Exh. P.E.) of Habib-
ur-Rehman (PW-5). The scrutiny of the statements of the prosecution witnesses 
reveals that the written application  (Exh. P.E.) of Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5) was 
neither prompt nor spontaneous nor natural, rather was a contrived, manufactured 
and a compromised document. Sufficient doubts have arisen and inference against 
the prosecution has to be drawn in this regard and the delay in reporting the matter 
to the police and the failure of the prosecution witnesses to proceed to the Police

Station evidences their absence at the time of occurrence, at the place of occurrence. 
Reliance is placed on the case of “Ghulam Abbas and another v. The State and 
another” (2021 SCMR 23) wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan observed 
as under:- 
“As per contents of F.I.R., the occurrence in this case took place on 19.06.2008 at 
01.40 a.m. and the matter was reported to the Police on the same morning at 07.00 
a.m. and as such there is a delay of more than five hours in reporting the crime to 
the Police whereas Police Station was situated at a distance of just six kilometers 
from the place of occurrence. No explanation whatsoever was furnished by the 
complainant for this delay in reporting the crime to the Police. Hameed Ullah Khan 
SI (PW.15) who investigated the case stated during his cross-examination that he 
reached at the place of occurrence at about 05.00 a.m. and he had completed the 
police proceedings by 06.30 p.m. In the circumstances, chances of deliberations 
and consultations before reporting the matter to the Police cannot be ruled out.” 
Reliance is also placed on the case of  “MUHAMMAD ASHRAF JAVEED and 
another vs. MUHAMMAD UMAR and others” (2017 SCMR 199) wherein the 
august Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased to hold as under: 
“The hospital is closely situated to the Police Station but neither the complainant 
nor P.W.s took a little pain to report the matter, nor the staff of the hospital 
including the treating doctor took initiative.” 
Guidance is also sought from the principle enunciated by the august Supreme Court 
of Pakistan in the case of “Zafar vs. The State  and others” (2018 SCMR 326) where 
the august Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased to hold as under:- 
 “It has been observed by us that the occurrence in this case as per prosecution 
took place on 03.09.1999 at 3.00 a.m. (later half of night) and the matter was 
reported to the police on the same day at 8.30 a.m. i.e. after five hours and thirty 
minutes of the occurrence. The distance between the place of occurrence and the 
police station is 09 miles. The postmortem on the dead body of deceased was 
conducted on the same day at 2.00 p.m. i.e. after 11 hours of the occurrence. No 
explanation whatsoever has been given by the complainant Shahadat Ali (PW5) 
and Umer Daraz (PW6) in the F.I.R. or while appearing before the learned trial 
Court qua the delay in lodging the F.I.R. or for that matter the belated postmortem 
of the deceased.” 
Guidance is sought from the principles enunciated by the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the cases of “G. M. NIAZ Vs. The State” (2018 SCMR 506), “Abdul 
Jabbar and another Vs. The State” (2019 S C M R 129) and “Muhammad Shafi 
alias Kuddoo Vs.  The State and others” (2019 S C M R 1045).

The learned counsel for the complainant and the learned Deputy Prosecutor 
General have also relied upon the statement made by Abdul Majeed ( then injured 
later deceased) at the THQ hospital Khairpur Tamewali upon the basis of which 
a Rapt No. 08 (Exh.PE/1)  was recorded. Before giving a conclusive finding 
regarding the legal worth of such statement of the deceased, we deem it appropriate 
to have a look on the law relevant on the subject. Such a statement is relevant under 
the provision of Article 46 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. Dying declaration, 
generally, stands for the statement of a person who is in expectation of his death and 
relates to the causes of his death. Such a statement is admissible in evidence though 
its maker does not appear in the witness box so as to provide an opportunity of cross-
examination to an accused facing the charge of his murder. The admissibility of the 
dying declaration is an exception to the general rule which makes inadmissible the 
hearsay evidence. Dying declaration can be made basis for awarding conviction 
provided it is free from the menace of prompting and tutoring and is proved to have 
been made by none other than the deceased himself. The paramount reason of 
attaching importance and credibility to such a statement is the presumption that a 
dying person seldom lies. For recording of dying declaration no hard and fast rules 
are laid down, however, a wade through the provisions of the Police Rules, 1934 
reveals that a procedure and brief guidelines are provided in chapter-25, Rule 21 
which are being reproduced below for advantage sake:-  
“25.21. Dying declarations.-(1) A dying declaration shall, whenever 
possible, be recorded by a Magistrate.  
(2) The person making the declaration shall, if possible, be examined by a 
medical officer with a view to ascertaining that he is sufficiently in 
possession of his reason to make a lucid statement.  
(3) If no magistrate can be obtained, the declaration shall, when a gazetted 
police officer is not present, be recorded in the presence of two or more 
reliable witnesses unconnected with the police department and with the 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 244 of 2021 
Criminal Revision    No. 166 of 2021 
 
 
23 
 
parties concerned in the case.  
(4) If no such witnesses can be obtained without risk of the injured person 
dying before his statement can be recorded, it shall be recorded in the 
presence of two or more police officers. 
(5) A dying declaration made to a police officer should, under section 162, 
Code of Criminal Procedure, be signed by the person making it."  
From above, it can be gathered that preferably such a statement is to be recorded 
either by a Magistrate or in the presence of a gazetted police officer and in absence 
thereof in front of two or more unconcerned reliable witnesses. However, if neither 
of the above mentioned persons are available, only then such a statement can be 
recorded in the presence of two or more police officers. In the present case, though 
Abdul Majeed (deceased) remained alive for as many as three days after the 
occurrence , and admitted in the hospital for a considerable time ,however, his 
purported statement (Exh.PE/1)  was not attested by any official working at the 
hospital. Furthermore, while appearing as a prosecution witnesses, none of the 
Medical Officers who had examined the deceased in an injured condition stated 
that  any statement of Abdul Majeed (deceased)  was recorded in their presence. 
The deceased remained in hospital for a considerable time, during which there was 
sufficient time for the investigating officer to record the dying declaration through a 
Magistrate which exercise was not done. Likewise, we have not been able to trace 
any explanation from the perusal of the record that as to why the statement of the 
deceased (Exh.PE/1) was not recorded in the presence of the doctor as it does not 
bear his signatures. It needs no mention that for a dying person, a doctor is like 
nothing less than an angel and the last ray of hope for him in his capacity as a savior 
of his life. In this backdrop, a doctor can be the best person to endorse the dying 
declaration as it is expected from a dying person to tell the whole truth to the doctor. 
In somewhat similar circumstances, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 244 of 2021 
Criminal Revision    No. 166 of 2021

expressed in the case of Mst. Zahida Bibi v. The State (PLD 2006 Supreme Court 
255) to the following effect:-  
"The rule of criminal administration of justice is that the dying declaration 
like an interested witness requires close scrutiny and is not to be believed 
merely for the reason that dying person is not expected to tell a lie. This is 
a matter of common knowledge that in such circumstances in preference to 
any other person, a doctor is most trustworthy and reliable person for a 
patient to depose confidence in him with the expectation of sympathy and 
better treatment to disclose the true facts."  
Furthermore, Muhammad Siddique, SI (PW-8) admitted during cross-examination 
that he did not  record the statement of any police official or any other person who 
had recorded the alleged statement of Abdul Majeed (deceased)  on which the Rapt 
No.08  (Exh.PE/1) was recorded. Muhammad Siddique, SI (PW-8), Investigating 
Officer of the case , also admitted during cross-examination that even the 
complainant of the case did not produce the said document during the 
investigation of the case. Muhammad Siddique, SI (PW-8) , admitted during 
cross-examination , as under:- 
“ When I received the information about the death of Abdul Majeed at that time, 
I have no knowledge about ruppat No.8 dated 07.11.2019. I did not join in 
investigation the said official who incorporated said ruppat.” (emphasis 
supplied)  
These aspects of the prosecution evidence are sufficient on their own to reject  the 
evidence with regard to the alleged statement of Abdul Majeed (deceased)  on 
which the Rapt No.08  (Exh.PE/1) was recorded.The document (Exh.PE/1) , the 
alleged dying declaration of Abdul Majeed (deceased) , is proved to be  a 
fabricated document.  
19. 
   We have noted with serious anxiety that the ocular account of the occurrence 
as furnished by the prosecution witnesses is inconsistent with the medical evidence 
as furnished by Dr. Qasim Hussain (PW-1) , Dr. Amin Ullah Khan (PW-2) and Dr. 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2021

Ahmad Faraz (PW-9)  and flawed beyond mending , resulting in disfiguring the 
complexion of the whole prosecution case beyond reparation and recognition. 
According to the statements of the prosecution witnesses namely Habib-ur-Rehman 
(PW-5) and Muhammad Bashir (PW-6) , during the occurrence  the appellant 
namely Khuda Bakhsh gave a blow with the stump of a cot, hitting on the back of 
head of Abdul Majeed (deceased). Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5)  in his statement before 
the learned trial court stated as under:- 
“1 also stated before the Police according to my application Ex.PE that 
Khuda Bakhsh accused, at the time of causing injuries to Abdul Majeed 
deceased, also injury to the deceased with the leg of cot (Paya) on the 
backside of his head” (emphasis supplied)  
Muhammad Bashir (PW-6)   in his statement before the learned trial court stated as 
under:- 
“Khuda Bakhsh also inflicted leg of cot (Paya) which hit on the backside 
of head of Abdul Majeed and caused serious injuries to him.”. (emphasis 
supplied)  
Contrary to the statements of  Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5) and Muhammad Bashir 
(PW-6) , Dr. Qasim Hussain (PW-1) who, on 07.11.2019, had examined Abdul 
Majeed (deceased) in an injured condition , did not observe presence of any such 
injury caused by the stump of a cot present on the back of head of Abdul Majeed 
(deceased). Dr. Qasim Hussain (PW-1) stated during cross-examination , as under:- 
“ When I medically examined injured Abdul Majeed, I did not observe any injury 
on his head. It is also correct that according to Ex.PA there is not mentioned any 
injury upon the head of Injured Abdul Majeed. It is correct that there is no abrasion 
and laceration was found by me on the head of the victim Abdul Majeed when I 
examined him.”(emphasis supplied)

 Similarly, Dr. Ahmad Faraz  (PW-9), who on 10.11.2019, conducted the 
postmortem examination of the dead body of Abdul Majeed son of Ghulam Qadir 
(deceased) did not observe presence of any injury on the back of head of the dead 
body of the deceased which could have been caused by use of a stump of a cot. 
Contrary to the statements of prosecution witnesses namely Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-
5) and Muhammad Bashir (PW-6) that the appellant namely Khuda Bakhsh gave a 
blow with the stump of a cot hitting him on the back of head of Abdul Majeed 
(deceased), Dr. Ahmad Faraz  (PW-9) opined that there was presence of only 
diffused  axonal injury of the brain which had been caused by the blow suffered by 
the deceased  on his face and there was no injury suffered by the deceased on the 
back of his head. Dr. Ahmad Faraz  (PW-9) opined as under:- 
“ FINAL OPINION: 
So, I am of the opinion that diffused axonal injury of brain may leads him to death. 
In this case it is highly suggestive that injury of face may cause diffuse axonal 
injury.” 
Similarly, Dr.Amin Ullah Khan (PW-2) also stated that diffused  axonal injury of 
the brain of Abdul Majeed (then injured later deceased) was detected, however, there 
was no fracture of the skull. Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) describes a type of 
traumatic brain injury (TBI). Specifically, it refers to the shearing of the brain’s long 
connecting nerve fibers, or axons. This can occur when the brain shifts and rotates 
inside the skull. Specifically, Diffuse axonal injury (DAI)  describes the shearing, or 
tearing, of nerve fibers known as axons. This trauma usually results from the brain 
quickly shifting within the skull. Following a sudden impact, mechanical forces 
cause nerve fibers to stretch and tear. Axons are the long, thread-like portion of 
neurons that conduct electrical impulses. They are responsible for communication 
between nerve cells. The grey and white matter of the axons are of distinct specific 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2021

27 
 
gravities, therefore the axons present at the grey-white matter junction are 
particularly susceptible to injury. Axonal disconnection and mechanical disruption 
to axonal cytoskeletal structure results in immediate severe brain injury. Destroyed 
axon microtubules will align incorrectly, with Tau and amyloid precursor protein 
(APP) are aberrantly deposited. As such, damage to axons may impair their ability 
to communicate and help coordinate bodily functions, which can lead to severe 
disabilities. Diffuse axonal injury (DAI)  is more common in high energy traumatic 
accidents in which the brain rotates or moves forward or backward inside the skull. 
Typically, this type of trauma involves accelerating and decelerating motions. If 
these forces are sufficiently strong, they can damage axons, causing these neuronal 
interconnections to malfunction or disconnect and affecting many brain areas. 
Diffuse axonal injury (DAI)  is an example of closed brain injuries. These injuries 
occur when there is a non-penetrating injury to the brain with no break in the skull. 
A closed brain injury is caused by a rapid forward or backward movement and 
shaking of the brain inside the bony skull that results in bruising and tearing of brain 
tissue and blood vessels. Closed brain injuries are usually caused by car accidents 
and falls. Shaking a baby can also result in this type of injury (called shaken baby 
syndrome). Without realizing this fact that Dr. Qasim Hussain (PW-1) , Dr. Amin 
Ullah Khan (PW-2) and Dr. Ahmad Faraz (PW-9)   had not observed any injury on 
the back of the head of the deceased ,and the Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) , according 
to the opinion of  Dr. Ahmad Faraz (PW-9),   was due to the blow on the face of the 
deceased, the prosecution witnesses namely Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5) and 
Muhammad Bashir (PW-6) , went on to state that during the occurrence  the 
appellant namely Khuda Bakhsh gave a blow with the stump of a cot, hitting on the 
back of head of Abdul Majeed (deceased). Furthermore,the prosecution witnesses 
namely  Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5) and Muhammad Bashir (PW-6) both claimed that

Criminal Revision    No. 166 of 2021

the deceased had also suffered an injury on his right shoulder , however, the said 
injury was not mentioned in the Rapt No.08 (Exh.PE/1) as the witnesses were in 
shock. Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5) during cross-examination , stated as under:- 
“ It is correct that head injury and injury on the shoulder of Abdul Majeed is not 
mentioned in ruppat No.02/08. dated 07.11.2019.”  
Muhammad Bashir (PW-6)  during cross-examination , stated as under:- 
“It is correct that on the first day at THQ, Khairpur Tamewall the Rappat which 
was reduced into writing by the police, the same was read over to me, in which, the 
injuries upon the head as well as right shoulder of Abdul Majeed were not 
mentioned in that Rappat. Volunteered that due to worry, we did not mention the 
above said injuries in the above said Rappat. ” 
Muhammad Siddique, SI (PW-8) , the Investigating Officer of the case ,also 
admitted during cross-examination , as under:- 
“ It is correct that as the injuries upon head and shoulder of Abdul Majeed were not 
mentioned in ruppat, so, due to this reason, the same was not converted in FIR and 
after submission of Ex.PE by the complainant, FIR was lodged.” 
 In this manner, the statements of the prosecution witnesses namely Habib-ur-
Rehman (PW-5) and Muhammad Bashir (PW-6) are in direct contradiction and in 
conflict with the opinion and observations of Dr. Qasim Hussain (PW-1) , Dr. Amin 
Ullah Khan (PW-2) and Dr. Ahmad Faraz (PW-9)   . In this manner, irreconcilable 
and harrowing contradictions have cropped up in the ocular account of the 
occurrence as narrated by the prosecution witnesses namely Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-
5) and Muhammad Bashir (PW-6) and the medical evidence as furnished by Dr. 
Qasim Hussain (PW-1) , Dr. Amin Ullah Khan (PW-2) and Dr. Ahmad Faraz (PW-
9)   . The contradictions in the ocular account of the occurrence, as narrated by 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 244 of 2021 
Criminal Revision    No. 166 of 2021 
 
 
29 
 
Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5) and Muhammad Bashir (PW-6)  and the medical evidence 
as furnished by Dr. Qasim Hussain (PW-1) , Dr. Amin Ullah Khan (PW-2) and Dr. 
Ahmad Faraz (PW-9)  , clearly establish that the prosecution miserably failed to 
prove the charge against the appellants. The contradictions in the ocular account of 
the occurrence, as narrated by Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5) and Muhammad Bashir 
(PW-6)  and the medical evidence, as furnished by Dr. Qasim Hussain (PW-1) , Dr. 
Amin Ullah Khan (PW-2) and Dr. Ahmad Faraz (PW-9), sound the death knell for 
the prosecution case and prove to be the cause of its sad demise. Had the witnesses 
seen the occurrence then there did not exist any possibility that they would fallen 
into error. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Muhammad Shafi 
alias Kuddoo vs. The State and others ” (2019 S C M R 1045) has held as under:- 
“Ocular account is in conflict with medical evidence inasmuch as 
according to the crime report both the appellant, as well as, Abdul Razzaq, 
co-accused, are assigned one blow each to the deceased, whereas 
according to the initial medical examination, Medical Officer noted solitary 
injury on the head, its impact on the eye has been utilized by the witnesses 
to array the latter in the crime.” 
Reliance is also placed on the case of “Muhammad Zaman  vs. The State and others” 
(2014 S C M R 749) wherein it has been held as under:- 
“The more so, when the total number of injuries found on the deceased as 
well as the injured could be caused by one or two L.G. Cartridges. The 
number of assailants in the circumstances of the case appears to have been 
exaggerated” 
Reliance is placed on the cases of “Muhammad Ali Vs. The State” (2015 SCMR 
137) “Muhammad Ashraf Vs. The State” ( 2012 S C M R 419) ,USMAN alias 
KALOO Vs. The State (2017 S C M R 622) ,Muhammad Hussain Vs. The State 
(2008 S C M R 345) and “Ain Ali and another Vs. The State” (2011 SCMR 323) 
where the august Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased to reject the evidence of 
prosecution witnesses when the same was found to be in contrast with the medical 
evidence.

The learned Deputy Prosecutor General along with the learned counsel 
for the complainant, have relied upon the recovery of the Soti (P-2) from the 
appellant namely  Khuda Bakhsh son of Ghafoor Ahmed and the recovery of the Soti 
(P-3) from the appellant namely Muhammad Zafar Iqbal son of Ghafoor Ahmed and 
have submitted that they offered sufficient corroboration of the ocular account of the 
occurrence as furnished by the prosecution witnesses . The recovery of the Soti  (P-
2) from the appellant namely  Khuda Bakhsh son of Ghafoor Ahmed and the 
recovery of the Soti (P-3) from the appellant namely Muhammad Zafar Iqbal son of 
Ghafoor Ahmed cannot be relied upon as the Investigating Officer of the case did 
not join any witness of the locality during the recovery of the Soti (P-2) from the 
appellant namely Khuda Bakhsh son of Ghafoor Ahmed and the recovery of the Soti 
(P-3) from the appellant namely Muhammad Zafar Iqbal son of Ghafoor Ahmed 
which action of his was in clear violation of the provisions of the section 103 Code 
of Criminal Procedure, 1898 and therefore the evidence of the recovery of the 
recovery of the Soti  (P-2) from the appellant namely  Khuda Bakhsh son of Ghafoor 
Ahmed and the recovery of the Soti (P-3) from the appellant namely Muhammad 
Zafar Iqbal son of Ghafoor Ahmed cannot be used as incriminating evidence against 
the appellants, being evidence which was obtained through illegal means and hence 
hit by the exclusionary rule of evidence. The provisions of section 103 Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1898, unfortunately, are honoured more in disuse than 
compliance. To appreciate it better, this section is being reproduced:- 
"103.--(1) Before making a search. under this chapter, the officer or other 
person about to make it shall call upon two or more respectable 
inhabitants of the locality in which the place to be searched is situate 
to attend and witness the search and may issue an order in writing to 
them or any of them so to do.

The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Muhammad Ismail and others 
Vs. The State” (2017 SCMR 898) at page 901 has held as under:- 
“For the above mentioned recovery of weapons the prosecution had failed to 
associate any independent witness of the locality and, thus, the mandatory 
provisions of section 103, Cr.P.C. had flagrantly been violated in that regard.” 
Moreover, none of the prosecution witnesses namely  Muhammad Bashir (PW-6) 
and Muhammad Siddique, SI (PW-8) , the Investigating Officer of the case ,who 
gave evidence that the Soti  (P-2)  recovered from the appellant namely  Khuda 
Bakhsh son of Ghafoor Ahmed and the Soti (P-3) recovered from the appellant 
namely Muhammad Zafar Iqbal son of Ghafoor Ahmed stated that the said articles 
were stained with blood. Muhammad Bashir (PW-6), admitted during cross-
examination , as under:- 
“It is correct that above said Sotis are not bloodstained.”  
With regard to the production of the stump of cot (P-1) produced by Habib-ur-
Rehman (PW-5) , it is observed that according to the statements of the Medical 
officers , the deceased had not suffered any injury caused by the use of such a stump 
of cot (P-1). In this manner, the recovery of the Soti  (P-2) from the appellant namely  
Khuda Bakhsh son of Ghafoor Ahmed and the recovery of the Soti (P-3) from the 
appellant namely Muhammad Zafar Iqbal son of Ghafoor Ahmed could not be 
proved and cannot be considered as a relevant fact for proving any fact in issue.  
21. 
The learned Deputy Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the 
complainant have also relied upon the evidence of motive and submitted that it 
corroborated the ocular account. The motive behind the occurrence of this case, as 
stated by the prosecution witness namely Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5) was that the 
deceased had divorced Haseena Mai, sister of the appellants , eight days prior to the 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 244 of 2021 
Criminal Revision    No. 166 of 2021 
 
 
32 
 
occurrence and therefore, the appellants committed the occurrence. The statement 
of the prosecution witness namely Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5) with regard to the 
motive of the occurrence as narrated by him was not supported or given evidence of 
by any other prosecution witness . Furthermore, the prosecution witness namely 
Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-5) was exposed as to had made blatant dishonest and 
substantial improvements in his previous statement with regard to the motive of the 
occurrence as narrative by him and during the statement of Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-
5) ,  the learned trial court  observed as under:- 
“I got recorded in my complaint Ex PE that Abdul Majeed deceased divorced his 
wife Mst. Haseena Mai sister of accused Khuda Bakhsh and Mohammad Zafar 
about eight days prior to the occurrence, the reason was that behind the occurrence. 
(Confronted with Ex.PE, wherein, it is not recorded). I got recorded in my 
complaint Ex.PE that after receiving the injuries, Abdul Majeed deceased went to 
THQ Hospital alongwith me and got recorded his statement before Khidmat 
Counter. (Confronted with Ex.PE, wherein, it is not recorded). ” 
Muhammad Siddique, SI (PW-8), the Investigating Officer of the case, also candidly 
admitted that he did not collect any evidence with regard to the motive of the 
occurrence and stated as under:- 
“ During my investigation, complainant and witnesses did not depose about the 
motive of the occurrence.” 
The perusal of the statements of the prosecution witnesses clearly proves that the 
prosecution witnesses failed to provide evidence enabling us to determine the 
truthfulness of the motive alleged, and the fact that the said motive was so 
compelling that it could have led the appellants to have committed the Qatl-i-Amd 
of the deceased .There are haunting contradictions with regard to the minutiae of 
motive alleged. No independent witness was produced by the prosecution to prove 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 244 of 2021 
Criminal Revision    No. 166 of 2021 
 
 
33 
 
the motive as alleged. Moreover, it is an admitted rule of appreciation of evidence 
that motive is only a corroborative piece of evidence and if the ocular account is 
found to be unreliable, then motive alone cannot be made the basis of conviction. 
Even otherwise, a tainted piece of evidence cannot corroborate another tainted piece 
of evidence. Reliance in this regard is placed on the case of Muhammad Javed v. The 
State (2016 SCMR 2021) . 
 
22. 
Considering all the above circumstances, we entertain serious doubt in our 
minds regarding the involvement of the appellants namely Khuda Bakhsh son of 
Ghafoor Ahmad  and Muhammad Zafar Iqbal son of Ghafoor Ahmad  in the present 
case. It is a settled principle of law that for giving the benefit of the doubt it is not 
necessary that there should be so many circumstances rather if only a single 
circumstance creating reasonable doubt in the mind of a prudent person is available 
then such benefit is to be extended to an accused not as a matter of concession but 
as of right. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Muhammad 
Mansha Vs. The State” (2018 SCMR 772) has enunciated the following principle: 
“Needless to mention that while giving the benefit of doubt to an accused it 
is not necessary that there should be many circumstances creating doubt. If 
there is a circumstance which creates reasonable doubt in a prudent mind 
about the guilt of the accused, then the accused would be entitled to the 
benefit of such doubt, not as a matter of grace and concession, but as a 
matter of right. It is based on the maxim, "it is better that ten guilty persons 
be acquitted rather than one innocent person be convicted". Reliance in this 
behalf can be made upon the cases of Tariq Pervez v. The State (1995 SCMR 
1345), Ghulam Qadir and 2 others v. The State (2008 SCMR 1221), 
Muhammad Akramv.The State (2009 SCMR 230) and Muhammad 
Zamanv.The State (2014 SCMR 749).” 
 
Reliance is also placed on the judgment of the august Supreme Court of Pakistan 
Najaf Ali Shah Vs. the State (2021 S C M R 736) in which it has been observed as 
infra: 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 244 of 2021 
Criminal Revision    No. 166 of 2021

“9. 
Mere heinousness of the offence if not proved to the hilt is not a 
ground to avail the majesty of the court to do complete justice. This is an 
established principle of law and equity that it is better that 100 guilty 
persons should let off but one innocent person should not suffer. As the 
preeminent English jurist William Blackstone wrote, "Better that ten 
guilty persons escape, than that one innocent suffer." Benjamin Franklin, 
who was one of the leading figures of early American history, went 
further arguing "it is better a hundred guilty persons should escape than 
one innocent person should suffer." All the contradictions noted by the 
learned High Court are sufficient to cast a shadow of doubt on the 
prosecution's case, which entitles the petitioner to the right of benefit of 
the doubt. It is a well settled principle of law that for the accused to be 
afforded this right of the benefit of the doubt it is not necessary that there 
should be many circumstances creating uncertainty and if there is only 
one doubt, the benefit of the same must got to the petitioner. This Court 
in the case of Mst. Asia Bibi v. The State (PLD 2019 SC 64) while relying 
on the the earlier judgments of We have categorically held that "if a 
single circumstance creates reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about 
the apprehension of guilt of an accused, then he/she shall be entitled to 
such benefit not as a matter of grace and concession, but as of right. 
Reference in this regard may be made to the cases of Tariq Pervaiz v. 
The State (1998 SCMR 1345) and Ayub Masih v. The State (PLD 2002 
SC 1048)." The same view was reiterated in Abdul Jabbar v. State (2010 
SCMR 129) when this court observed that once a single loophole is 
observed in a case presented by the prosecution, such as conflict in the 
ocular account and medical evidence or presence of eye-witnesses being 
doubtful, the benefit of such loophole/lacuna in the prosecution's case 
automatically goes in favour of an accused.” 
23.  
 For what has been discussed above, the Criminal Appeal No.244 of 2021 
lodged by the appellants namely Khuda Bakhsh son of Ghafoor Ahmad and 
Muhammad Zafar Iqbal son of Ghafoor Ahmad  is allowed. The convictions and 
sentences of the appellants namely  Khuda Bakhsh son of Ghafoor Ahmad and 
Muhammad Zafar Iqbal son of Ghafoor Ahmad  awarded by the learned trial court 
through the impugned judgment dated 03.06.2021 are hereby set-aside. The 
appellants namely Khuda Bakhsh son of Ghafoor Ahmad and Muhammad Zafar 
Iqbal son of Ghafoor Ahmad  are ordered to be acquitted by extending them the 
benefit of the doubt. The appellant namely Khuda Bakhsh son of Ghafoor Ahmad is 
in custody and  is directed to be released forthwith if not required in any other case. 
The sentence of the appellant namely Muhammad Zafar Iqbal son of Ghafoor 
Ahmad  was suspended by this Court vide order dated 10.06.2021 and the appellant 
namely Muhammad Zafar Iqbal son of Ghafoor Ahmad  is present before the Court

on bail. The sureties of the appellant shall stand discharged from their liability and 
the bail bonds submitted by the appellant namely Muhammad Zafar son of Ghafoor 
Ahmad  are hereby cancelled. 
24.

convict namely Muhammad Zafar Iqbal  son of Ghafoor Ahmad , is hereby 
dismissed.
