This Sales Tax Reference Application under 
section 47 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 („Act, of 
1990‟) arises out of order dated 21.06.2022, 
whereby Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue, 
Lahore Bench, Lahore (Appellate Tribunal) 
allowed Sales Tax appeal, preferred by the 
registered person, and set-aside the orders 
concurrently passed by the Commissioner Inland 
Revenue (CIR) and CIR (Appeals). 
2. 
Following questions of law, statedly arisen 
out of the order of Appellate Tribunal, are 
proposed for soliciting an answer thereto, 
“(a) Whether in the facts and circumstances of the 
case, the learned ATIR was justified to reply on 
the judgment of the ATIR in STA 262/KB/2018 
which holds that the provision of section 11(1) of 
the Act do not allow recovery and imposition of 
penalty and default surcharge alone where 
liability on account of principal amount of tax 
stands discharged voluntarily prior to initiation 
of proceedings under section 11(1) of the Act, 

STR No. 77498/2022 
 
-:2:- 
 
 
 
ignoring the express provisions of law that there 
is no amnesty from penalty u/s 33 and default 
surcharge u/s 34 in the proceedings initiated 
under section 11(1) of the Sales Tax Act, 1990?    
(b) 
Whether in the facts and circumstances of the 
case order passed by learned ATIR is against the 
ratio settled in the reported judgment cited as 
2016 PTD 643 Lahore which holds that 
irrespective of the fact whether tax has been paid 
or not, filing of return is mandatory and non-
submission of return within due date would 
amount to commission of an offence and same 
would hold the registered person liable under 
the provisions of section 33 of the Sales Tax Act, 
1990?” 
3. 
Learned counsel for applicant department 
submits that reliance of the Appellate Tribunal on 
its earlier decision is misplaced, unwarranted, 
and contrary to the decision made in the case of 
Commissioner Inland Revenue vs. Madina Cotton 
Ginners and Oil Mills (2016 PTD 643). Submits that 
show cause notice was issued under section 11 of 
Act of 1990 on the allegation of delayed filing of 
tax returns and delayed payment of tax due and 
payable, whereby the factum of delay in filing 
returns and non-payment of tax on due dates was 
acknowledged, which situation attracts incidence 
of penalty and default surcharge. Learned 
counsel has placed reliance on cases reported as 
Messrs Attock Refinery Limited and others vs. The 
Collector of Sales Tax and others (2021 PTD 1680), 
Messrs Punjab Small Industries, Rawalpindi vs. Deputy 
Collector Adjudication and others (2021 PTD 871), Dhan 
Fibers Ltd. vs. Central Board of Revenue, Islamabad and 
others (2006 PTD 2683).

Conversely, learned counsel for the taxpayer 
defended the order and placed reliance on 
decision handed down by learned Division Bench 
of Hon‟ble Balochistan High Court in STR 
No.05/2021, titled as The Commissioner Inland 
Revenue Zone-I, Regional Tax 643 Office, Quetta vs. 
Messrs Quetta Electric Supply Company Limited, 
Zarghoon Road, Quetta, decided on 6th June 2022, 
who precisely relied on paragraphs No.11 and 12 
of the decision. 
5. 
Submissions Heard. 
6. 
We have examined the decision referred in 
the case of Messrs Quetta Electric Supply Company 
Limited, (supra), and do not, respectfully, subscribe 
to the interpretation proposed to sub-section (1) 
of section 11 of Act of 1990, and proviso thereto. 
There is no cavil that sub-section (1) of section 
11, ibid, entitles the Officer Inland Revenue, 
after notice and upon happening of event(s) of 
default as identified therein, to „make an order of 
assessment of tax including imposition of penalty 
and default surcharge in accordance with section 
33 and 34‟. Proviso to sub-section (1) of section 
11 of Act of 1990 provides an eventuality of 
abatement of order, if passed, and the notice, 
provided default is addressed upon payment of 

STR No. 77498/2022 
 
-:4:- 
 
 
 
tax along with default surcharge and penalty and 
filing of return(s) after due date. To distinguish 
the ratio laid, it is appropriate to reproduce 
paragraphs 11 and 12 of the case of Messrs Quetta 
Electric Supply Company Limited, (supra), which read 
as, 
“11. 
In both the above cases the Officer of Inland 
Revenue shall issue a show-cause notice and 
impose penalty and default surcharge under 
sections 33 and 34 of the Act. The Officer can issue 
show-cause notice if no return is filed or if return is 
filed but tax payable is not fully paid. Perusal of 
order-in-original shows that the registered person 
had already filed return, although after due date, 
before issuance of show-cause notice. Therefore at 
the time of issuance of show-cause notice the above 
two eventualities were nonexistent. Therefore the 
officer was not justified to issue show-cause as such 
to impose penalty and default surcharge when the 
registered person had already filed return and paid 
tax. At best the Officer could have issued a show-
cause if tax paid by the registered person was less 
than the tax actually payable. Even if show-cause 
notice is issued in case of said two eventualities 
then the moment the registered person files return 
and pay tax as well as penalty and default 
surcharge then such show-cause notice stands 
abated as provided in Proviso to subsection (1) of 
section 11 of the Act. Proviso to subsection (1) of 
section 11 of the Act provides that where a person 
required to file a tax return files the return after the 
due date and pays the amount of tax payable in 
accordance with the tax return along with default 
surcharge and penalty, the notice to show-cause 
and the order of assessment shall abate. It means 
that even if a registered person falls in any of the 
aforesaid two eventualities and the Officer issues a 
show-cause notice or pass an assessment order 
under subsection (1) of section 11 but thereafter the 
registered person files return after due date and 
also pays tax on the basis of such return along with 
default surcharge and penalty then show-cause 
notice as well as assessment order under subsection 
(1) of section 11 shall abate. 
12. In the light of above legal and factual aspects of 
the case it is evident that for imposition of penalty 
under section 33 and default surcharge under 
section 34 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 an Officer of 
Inland Revenue may invoke provisions of subsection 
(1) of section 11 and issue show-cause notice and 
pass an assessment order if the registered person 
has either failed to file return by due date or having 
filed return by due date pays an amount which, for 

STR No. 77498/2022 
 
-:5:- 
 
 
 
some miscalculation is less than the amount of tax 
actually payable. Since both the eventualities 
triggering action under subsection (1) of section 11 
of the act were nonexistent hence show-cause notice 
and subsequent order in original passed by the 
Officer of Inland Revenue are not sustainable and 
the learned Tribunal has rightly annulled orders of 
the 
Officer 
of 
Inland 
Revenue 
and 
the 
Commissioner (Appeals).” 
  
7. 
Matter calls for interpretation of sub-section 
(1) of section 11 of Act of 1990 and proviso 
thereto, which are reproduced hereunder as,   
Section 11. “Assessment of Tax 
& 
Recovery of Tax not levied or short levied or 
erroneously refunded] .– (1) Where a person 
who is required to file a tax return fails to 
file the return for a tax period by the due 
date or pays an amount which, for some 
miscalculation is less than the amount of tax 
actually payable, an officer of Inland 
Revenue shall, after a notice to show cause 
to such person, make an order for 
assessment of tax, including imposition of 
penalty and default surcharge in accordance 
with sections 33 and 34:  
 
Provided that where a person 
required to file a tax return files the 
return after the due date and pays 
the amount of tax payable in 
accordance with the tax return along 
with default surcharge and penalty, 
the notice to show cause and the 
order of assessment shall abate.

8. 
Omission / inaction on the part of registered 
person in filing return by prescribed date or upon 
short payment of the tax due, entitles the Officer 
of Inland Revenue, subject to notice, to „make an 
order of assessment including imposition of 
penalty and default surcharge in accordance 
with section 33 and 34‟. Proviso to sub-section 
(1) of section 11 provides an opportunity to the 

STR No. 77498/2022 
 
-:6:- 
 
 
 
registered person to address an event of default, 
by filing return after the due date and upon 
payment of tax payable according to the return 
along with default surcharge and penalty, 
whereupon show cause notice and order of 
assessment, if any made, would abate. Provision 
of law under reference neither contemplates nor 
absolves 
the 
registered 
person 
from 
the 
consequence of default, triggered upon failing to 
file return for the tax period by due date or short 
payment of tax.  
In 
terms 
of 
section 
11(1) 
of 
Act, 
consequence of incidence of default is a default 
surcharge and penalty, even if no tax is payable 
as per the tax return. Default position can only be 
reversed / addressed by opting for concession 
prescribed in proviso to sub-section (1) of section 
11 of Act, 1990, subject to fulfillment of 
conditions – upon filing of tax return after due 
date and making payment of tax along with 
default surcharge and/or penalty, depending upon 
the nature of default. Mere filing of delayed 
return of tax, before issuance of notice, would 
not be considered an act of compliance, 
especially when default had triggered, which can 
be reconciled upon voluntarily meeting the 
conditions prescribed in proviso to section 11(1) 

STR No. 77498/2022 
 
-:7:- 
 
 
 
of Act. It is inconceivable how a default, once 
accrued, 
would 
stand 
reconciled 
without 
fulfilling the requirements provided in proviso. 
Proviso must be given effect, which does not 
indicate or refers to incidence of any order of 
assessment of tax or notice, as condition 
precedent for claiming default surcharge and 
penalty. 
Default 
situation 
could 
only 
be 
addressed by invoking assistance of the proviso, 
upon meeting the conditions prescribed. Creating 
a novel situation, other than the one provided 
under the provision of law, tantamount to 
legislate, through a judicial verdict. This is 
unwarranted. 
Assumptions 
reached 
and 
hypothesis drawn cannot alter the scope, effect 
and consequences provided in sub-section (1) of 
section 11 of Act of 1990 and proviso thereto. 
Coupling the necessity of having underlaying tax 
liability for the purposes of defining the scope of 
„order of assessment of tax‟ manifests misreading 
of sub-section (1) of section 11, ibid, and 
otherwise 
tantamount 
to 
undermine 
the 
individuality and significance of section 34 of the 
Act of 1990, which opens with a „non-obstante‟ 
expression - „Notwithstanding the provisions of 
section 11. Effect of non-obstante status of 
section 34 of the Act, 1990 was neither 

STR No. 77498/2022 
 
-:8:- 
 
 
 
considered nor dilated upon in the case of Messrs 
Quetta Electric Supply company Limited, (supra). Even 
if upon filing of return after due date no tax – 
defined in terms of section 2(34) of Act, 1990 
and subject to the context - is payable, still 
penalty and default surcharge could be ordered 
and claimed. Restrictive interpretation of the 
scope of “order of assessment of tax” would 
nullifies the disciplined compliance envisaged in 
law and otherwise render sections 33 and 34 of 
Act, 1990, redundant. This redundancy needs to 
be 
avoided upon harmonized reading of 
applicable provisions. Notably, decision in the 
case of Messrs Quetta Electric Supply Company 
Limited, Zarghoon Road, Quetta (supra) has not 
appreciated earlier decisions made in the cases of 
Madina Cotton Ginners and Oil Mills (supra), Messrs 
Attock Refinery Limited and others, (supra). 
 10. The question at serial (a) is answered in 
negative. And question at serial (b) is answered 
in the affirmative. Order of Appellate Tribunal is 
found legally defective. Matter is remitted to 
Appellate Tribunal for de novo determination. 
Appeal of the registered person shall be deemed 
pending and same be decided afresh, after 
affording opportunity of hearing the parties.
