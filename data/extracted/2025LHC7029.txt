Briefly, as per case of prosecution narrated in the First Information 
Report (F.I.R./Ex.PA) got recorded by Muhammad Qasim, A.S.I. 
(complainant/PW-3), appellant was apprehended on 03.06.2022 as suspect 
by the complainant and other police officials and on his personal search, 
from white coloured shopper, blackish brown coloured slab type charas 
weighing 1320-grams was recovered from his possession; out of the 
recovered charas, 66-grams as sample was separated for getting chemical 
analysis from PFSA whereas sample and remaining charas were secured into 
sealed parcels with the stamps of “MQ” and taken into possession through 
recovery memo (Ex.PB); for ready reference, relevant portion of the Crime 
Report (F.I.R./Ex.PA) is hereby scanned below: - 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
After investigation, challan report was sent to the Court against the 
appellant; charge was framed against him under Section: 9(c) of the 
Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, to which, he pleaded not guilty 
and claimed trial; prosecution produced its evidence and thereafter trial 
Court recorded statement of the appellant under Section: 342 Cr.P.C., 
wherein he refuted allegations leveled against him; he neither recorded his 
statement under Section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor produced any evidence in his

defence. Trial court after hearing learned counsel for the parties, passed 
the impugned judgment wherein appellant was convicted and sentenced as 
mentioned above. 
3.  
Learned counsel for the appellant, at the very outset, submits that as 
per case of prosecution, charas weighing 1320-grams was recovered from 
the appellant on 03.06.2022, case was registered against him vide F.I.R. 
No.178/2022 dated: 03.06.2022 (Ex.PA) under Section: 9 (c) of the Control 
of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 at Police Station: Shaheen Chowk, 
District: Gujrat and charge was framed against him on 16.09.2022 under 
said offence i.e. Section: 9(c) of the Act (ibid) however as per paragraph 
No.18 of the impugned judgment, inadvertently, appellant has been 
convicted and sentenced under Section: 9(1) 3(c) of the CNSA, 1997; 
further submits that though case of the prosecution regarding recovery of 
charas weighing 1320-grams from the appellant has been proved against 
the appellant through prosecution evidence and he does not challenge the 
same yet appellant was liable to be convicted and sentenced under 
erstwhile Section: 9(c) of the Act (ibid) and requests for converting 
conviction of the appellant from Section: 9 (1) 3(c) of the Act (ibid) 
introduced through Control of Narcotic Substances (Amendment) Act, 
2022 to erstwhile Section: 9(c) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 
1997 as well as awarding lesser sentence of imprisonment and fine upon 
the appellant.

while 
confirming 
aforementioned factors submit that since in this case charas weighing 
1320-grams was recovered from the appellant on 03.06.2022 and case was 
registered against him vide F.I.R. No.178/2022 dated: 03.06.2022 (Ex.PA,

mentioned above) under erstwhile Section: 9(c) of the Control of Narcotic 
Substances Act, 1997, charge was framed against the appellant by the trial 
court under said offence, therefore, the appellant cannot be convicted and 
sentenced under Section: 9(1) 3(c) of the Act (ibid) which offence was 
brought on the statute through the Control of Narcotic Substances 
(Amendment) Act, 2022 (Act No.XX of 2022) promulgated in the month 
of September, 2022 i.e. after registration of instant case and said 
conviction is also hit by Article 12 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic 
of Pakistan, 1973; hence, it would be necessary to convert conviction 
recorded by the trial court against the appellant from Section: 9(1) 3(c) of 
the Act (ibid) introduced through the Control of Narcotic Substances 
(Amendment) Act, 2022 to erstwhile Section: 9(c) of the Control of 
Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 and award sentence to the appellant under 
erstwhile Section: 9(c) of the Act (ibid); they while producing copy of 
report bearing No.22650 dated: 01.12.2025 prepared and sent by the 
Superintendent, District Jail, Gujrat (which has been placed on the record) 
submit that since appellant has already served out imprisonment of            
02-years, 05-months and 06-days till 01.12.2025 and there is no statutory 
threshold/limit for lesser sentence under erstwhile Section: 9(c) of the 
Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, therefore, it would be 
appropriate to award sentence of the imprisonment already undergone by 
the appellant and impose fine of Rs.20,000/- upon him and in default of 
payment of the same to undergo 05-month’s Simple Imprisonment.

Arguments heard. Record perused. 
6.   
Although learned counsel for the appellant has not challenged the 
conviction recorded by the trial court against the appellant yet for safe 

Crl. Appeal No.85571 of 2023

administration of justice, we have gone through the record and it has been 
found that case of the prosecution to the extent of recovery of the 
narcotics i.e. charas weighing 1320-grams from possession of the 
appellant as well as its safe custody has been proved by the prosecution 
through trustworthy and confidence inspiring evidence; moreover, report 
of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Ex.PE) produced in the case 
has established that said narcotics was ‘charas’. Appellant did not appear 
under Section: 340(2) Cr.P.C. and also did not produce any evidence to 
create any dent in the case of prosecution to the extent of recovery of 
narcotics (mentioned above). So, prosecution has proved its case against 
the appellant to the extent of recovery of charas weighing 1320-grams.   
Now coming to the conviction recorded by the trial court, it is 
admitted fact that as per case of prosecution, charas weighing 1320-grams 
was recovered from possession of the appellant on 03.06.2022 {i.e. much 
prior to the promulgation of  “The Control of Narcotic Substances 
(Amendment) Act, 2022 (Аct No.XX of 2022), which was promulgated 
in the month of September, 2022}; case was registered as per Column 
No.3 of the Crime Report (Ex.PA) under erstwhile Section: 9(c) of the 
Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, charge was framed under 
erstwhile offence i.e. Section: 9(c) of the Act (ibid); therefore, mentioning 
of conviction of the appellant by the trial court in paragraph No.18 of the 
impugned judgment under Section: 9(1) 3(c) of CNSA is against           
Article: 12 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 as 
well as settled principles of law on the subject including fundamental 
principle of law known as “prohibition against ex post facto law”  and we 
see eye to eye with the contention raised by learned counsel for the 

Crl. Appeal No.85571 of 2023

appellant in this regard which has also been fairly conceded by learned 
Deputy Prosecutors General.  
It is relevant to mention here that the appellant has faced the agony 
of trial since his arrest, basic and prime purpose behind criminal justice 
system is to enable an offender to reform himself and to rehabilitate for 
rejoining the mainstream of prosperous life and once again to become a 
useful member of the society and not to wreak vengeance; since quantity 
of recovered contraband is not exceeding 10-KG, hence, there was no 
statutory threshold/limit of minimum quantum of sentence under erstwhile 
Section: 9(c) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997. By now it 
is well settled that on the basis of valid reason, plea for reduction of 
sentence can be entertained and considered if substantial period of 
sentence has already been served out by the convict/appellant; in this 
regard, guidance has been sought from the case of “MST. SUGHRAN 
AND ANOTHER vs. The STATE” (2021 SCMR 109). According to 
copy of report bearing No.22650 dated: 01.12.2025 prepared and sent by 
the Superintendent, District Jail, Gujrat (produced today by learned 
Deputy Prosecutors General and placed on the record), appellant has 
already served out 02-years, 05-months and 06-days till 01.12.2025; 
therefore, it would be in the interest of justice if he is awarded sentence of 
imprisonment comprising of the period which he has already undergone 
(mentioned above) and afforded opportunity to reform himself as well as 
become a useful member of the society and in this regard, case of 
“ABDUL REHMAN vs. The STATE” (2011 SCMR 965) can be 
advantageously referred, wherein it has been held as under: -

“After perusal of the record in light of the arguments advanced 
before us, it appears that there is no previous record of the 
conviction of the petitioner in any offence. The recovery effected 
in Charas as pointed out by the learned counsel is distinct from 
heroin, therefore, the case calls for a lenient view.” 
 
Guidance on the subject has also been sought from the cases of                  
“NIAZ-UD-DIN vs. The STATE”  (2007 SCMR 206) and “STATE through 
the Deputy Director (Law), Regional Directorate, Anti-Narcotics Force vs. 
MUJAHID NASEEM LODHI” (PLD 2017 SC 671). 
 
7. 
In view of above and with consent of learned counsel for the 
appellant as well as learned Deputy Prosecutors General, conviction 
recorded by the trial court against the appellant under Section: 9(1) 3(c) of 
CNSA vide impugned judgment is converted to “conviction under 
erstwhile Section: 9(c) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 
1997” and he is awarded sentence of “02-years, 05-months and              
06-days rigorous imprisonment including benefit of Section: 382-B 
Cr.P.C”, fine of Rs.20,000/- (Rupees twenty thousand only) is also 
imposed upon him and in default of payment of fine, he will undergo 
05-month’s Simple Imprisonment. Nutshell is that instant appeal is 
dismissed with aforementioned modifications in the conviction as well as 
sentence.
