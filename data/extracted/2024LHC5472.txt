Ch. Muhammad Iqbal, J:-  In the Banking recovery suits 
the pecuniary jurisdiction of this Court is not less than 100 
Million Rupees. The Respondent Bank filed a suit for recovery of 
Rs.101,523,957/07 before this Court and Hon’ble Judge Banking 
Court passed a decree to the tune of Rs.90,639,457.34 and same 
by operation of law was converted into execution petition. In 
Execution Application (Ex. A. No.221429 of 2018), judgment 
debtor filed application for return of Execution Application for 
want of pecuniary jurisdiction. The learned Single Judge in 
Chamber passed order dated 16.10.2018 in C.M. No.1 of 2018, 
para Nos.1 to 3 and 5 whereof are reproduced as under:- 
 
This is an application filed by the judgment debtors 
seeking, inter alia, return of the execution application on the ground 
of pecuniary jurisdiction.  
2. 
It is stated that the decree was passed in the sum of 
Rs.90,639,457.34 which does not come within the pecuniary 
jurisdiction of this Court and as such the execution application is 
liable to be returned for its presentation before  the relevant banking 
court. 
3. 
The objection of the judgment debtors is not 
tenable in as much as the suit filed by the decree holder bank sought

recovery of Rs.108,396,405.12. It is an established position of law 
that for the purposes of  determining the valuation of the suit, only 
the allegations in the plaint are to be looked at and that the plaintiff 
has an absolute discretion to put his own valuation on the suit. It is 
also an equally established principle of law that question of 
jurisdiction is to be determined with reference to the amount 
claimed in the suit and not with reference to the decree that may be 
passed. 
5. 
In the circumstances, this application to the extent 
of raising objection on the pecuniary jurisdiction of this Court is 
hereby dismissed with permission to the judgment debtors to agitate 
other objections after the filing of the draft proclamation of sale. 
 
Accordingly, application of the judgment debtor for return of the 
execution petition on the basis of want of pecuniary jurisdiction 
was turned down which order has been assailed through filing 
Execution First Appeal No.248622/2018.  
 
Similarly, in suit for recovery titled as MCB Bank Limited 
Vs. Al-Hameed Rice Mills, the claimed amount was 
Rs.108,414,634.84 whereas a final decree of Rs.62,527,590.56 
was passed which decree was converted into Execution 
Application No.15133/2021 wherein learned Single Judge in 
Chamber conversely held vide order dated 08.06.2021 that the 
jurisdiction of the executing Court will be determined as per the 
amount mentioned in the decree and passed order for transfer of 
execution to the concerned Banking Court. The said order is 
reproduced as under: 
 
In this case judgment and decree was passed for an 
amount of Rs.62,527,590/-. A learned Division Bench of this Court 
in EFA No.1059 of 2016 titled Zari Traqiati  Bank Limited v. Faran 
Maiz Industries (Pvt.) Limited has held that the jurisdiction of the 
executing court shall be determined with reference to the amount of 
the decree. 
2. 
In this view of the matter, the office is directed to 
transfer this case to concerned banking court for its further 
adjudication.  
The above said order has been assailed through Execution First 
Appeal No.43805/2021. Both the above appeals (EFAs) were set 
down for hearing before different learned Division Benches 
wherein the matters were referred vide orders dated 18.12.2018 

 
E.F.A No.248622/2018 
 
3
and 14.10.2021 respectively, to the Hon’ble Chief Justice for 
constitution of a Larger Bench. Hence, the above issue is fixed 
for final determination before this Bench to answer the following 
question: 
“Whether a decree of lessor amount than the pecuniary 
jurisdiction of Judge Banking of this Court in a recovery 
suit valuing more than 100 Million rupees is executable by 
this Court or the same is liable to be returned for filing it 
before the proper forum?” 
2. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
3.  
In Section 2(b)(i) of the Financial Institutions (Recovery 
of Finances) Ordinance 2001, the value of the suit filed before the 
Banking Court is described as not more than rupees 100 million, 
whereas valuation of the suit beyond the above said limit, the 
jurisdiction is vested with High Court under Section 2(b) (ii) of 
the said Ordinance. For ready reference, aforesaid provision is 
reproduced as under: 
 “2. Definitions.- In this Ordinance, unless there is anything 
repugnant in the subject or context— 
(b) “Banking Court” means— 
 (i) in respect of a case in which the claim does not 
exceed hundred million rupees or for the trial of offences 
under this Ordinance, the Court established under section 
5; and 
(ii)  in respect of any other case, the High Court.” 
 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis supplied)  
Further, in Chapter 3 of Volume I of the Rules and Orders of the 
Lahore High Court, Lahore the value of the suit for the purpose 
of court fee and jurisdiction is the value mentioned in the plaint 
by the plaintiff. As no specific valuation of the suit is mentioned 
in the Suits Valuation Act, 1887, thus, fixing appropriate value of 
the suit for the purpose of Court fee & jurisdiction is left at the 

 
E.F.A No.248622/2018 
 
4
discretion of the plaintiff. Ordinarily on the basis of value 
mentioned in the plaint, the pecuniary jurisdiction of the Court is 
presumed to be the same, however, if the Court modifies the 
value of the suit then the changed value will be considered as 
value of the suit for the purpose of pecuniary jurisdiction of a 
court. Reliance in this regard is placed on cases cited as Zahid 
Zaman Khan and others Vs. Khan Afsar and others (PLD 2016 
SC 409), Mst. Parveen (deceased) through LRs. Vs. Muhammad 
Pervaiz and others (2022 SCMR 64), Messrs Mardan Ways Sui 
Northern Gas Pipelines Limited Station Vs. General Manager 
SNGPL and others (2022 SCMR 584) and Mumtaz Hussain Vs. 
Haji Muhammad Bashir and others (PLD 2016 Lahore 97). 
Further, a plaintiff is competent to fix the value of the suit for 
recovery under the Ordinance ibid and if the Banking Court 
disagrees with the value fixed by the plaintiff, it should determine 
and fix the value of the suit as per provisions of the Suits 
Valuation Act, 1887 after holding appropriate inquiry and 
collecting material and after such determination of value the 
matter is liable to be adjudicated by the Court of competent 
jurisdiction. Reliance in this regard is placed on cases cited as 
Shafaqat Iqbal and others Vs. Ghulam Rasool and another (PLD 
2001 Lahore 139) and Muhammad Saleem and 3 others Vs. Pak 
Brunei 
Investment 
Company 
Ltd. 
through 
Chief 
Manager/President (2022 CLD 84). 
4. 
Furthermore, here the matter is somewhat different as 
after affixation of the value of the suit by the plaintiff and 
conclusion of civil trial a decree has been passed. Suffice it to say 
that after passing of a decree in a suit for recovery by the Banking 
Court under Section 19 of the Ordinance ibid, the decree is 
automatically converted into execution proceedings. For ready 
reference, Section 19 of the Ordinance ibid is reproduced as 
under: 

 
E.F.A No.248622/2018 
 
5
 “19. Execution of decree and sale with or without 
intervention of Banking Court.-  
(1) Upon pronouncement of judgment and decree by a 
Banking Court, the suit shall automatically stand converted 
into execution proceedings without the need to file a separate 
application and no fresh notice need be issued to the judgment-
debtor in this regard. Particulars of the mortgaged, pledged or 
hypothecated property and other assets of the judgment-debtor 
shall be filed by the decree-holder for consideration of the 
Banking Court and the case will be heard by the Banking 
Court for execution of its decree on the expiry of 30 days from 
the date of pronouncement of judgment and decree:  
Provided that if the record of the suit is summoned at any stage 
by the High Court for purposes of hearing an appeal under 
section 22 or otherwise, copies of the decree and other 
property documents shall be retained by the Banking Court for 
purposes of continuing the execution proceedings. 
(2)   The decree of the Banking Court shall be executed in 
accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 
1908 (Act V of 1908) or any other law for the time being in 
force or in such manner as the Banking Court may at the 
request of the decree-holder consider appropriate, including 
recovery as arrears of land revenue. ” 
 
 
 
(emphasis supplied)  
It is settled law that pecuniary jurisdiction should be ascertained 
from the value assessed by the plaintiff in the plaint and if the 
Court alters the said value in appeal etc., in that eventuality the 
pecuniary jurisdiction will remain same as mentioned in the 
plaint. Reliance is placed on a judgment titled as Dr. Pir 
Muhammad Khan Vs. Khuda Bukhsh and others (2015 SCMR 
1243).  
5.  
In the Ordinance ibid no clear provision is available for 
transfer of execution petition pending before this Court to any 
Banking Court below. The Court who has passed the decree in 
the Banking Suit for recovery, regardless of the fact that either the 
decree was passed for the amount lessor or higher than the value 
fixed in the plaint, that Court seized of the suit under Section 19 
of the Ordinance ibid is competent to execute its decree. In a 
judgment titled as MCB Bank Limited through Duly Authorized 

 
E.F.A No.248622/2018 
 
6
Attorney Vs. Eden Developers (Pvt.) Limited and others (2019 
CLD 219) similar controversy has been resolved holding therein 
that the pecuniary jurisdiction of executing Court is the amount 
mentioned in the plaint before the Banking Court. This Court 
being Banking Court is under legal obligation to execute the 
decree and pecuniary value of jurisdiction would be the amount 
mentioned by the plaintiff in the plaint and the Banking Court is 
the only forum to execute the decree and to decide all ancillary 
matters relating to the execution, discharge and satisfaction of the 
decree. For ready reference, relevant portion of the judgment 
(supra) is reproduced as under: 
“9.  The entire reliance of the learned counsel for the applicant 
was on the judgment of a learned Single Judge of this Court 
reported as Habib Bank limited through Attorneys v. Messrs 
Rehmania Textile Mills (Pvt.) Ltd, Jhang Road Faisalabad and 
30 others (2003 CLD 689). However, the facts in the cited 
precedent are distinguishable from the facts in the present case 
and, therefore, the said judgment cannot form a binding 
precedent for the purposes of the present case. In Messrs 
Rehmania Textile Mills the judgment and decree was passed 
by the Banking Tribunal, Faisalabad (as it then was under the 
Banking Tribunals Ordinance, 1984) for a sum of 
Rs.4,36,06,891/-. On appeal, the Division Bench of this Court 
allowed the appeal and modified the terms of the decree as a 
result of a compromise between the parties. The execution 
petition was filed by the decree holder for enforcement of the 
modified judgment and decree dated 18.3.1999. However, the 
fact remains that the claim filed by the plaintiff was for a 
higher sum and the consent decree was passed for lesser 
amount. The holding of the learned Single Judge was swayed 
by the definition of the term “Banking Court” given section 2 
(b) of the Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) 
Ordinance, 2001. However as distinguished above, in the 
present case the consent decree was for an amount of Rs.125 
Million which was within the pecuniary jurisdiction of this 
Court. Thereafter certain amounts were paid out of Court and 
as observed in the prceeding paragraph, they were merely 
required to be certified by the decree holder or the judgment 
debtor as the case may be and an execution for the rest of the 
amount after deducting the certified amount is liable to be take 

 
E.F.A No.248622/2018 
 
7
place. In my opinion, the present case does not turn on the 
definition of Banking court as relied upon in Messrs Rehmania 
Textile Mills. Moreover, the learned Single Judge did not 
advert his full attention to the concept envisaged by the 
Ordinance, 2001 whereby the decree passed by this Court is 
automatically converted into an execution petition. One may 
also visualize a situation where the amount of decree 
ultimately passed by this Court may be much less than the 
amount claimed in the suit by a plaintiff and which amount 
may fall below the threshold of pecuniary limit for the High 
Court to exercise its jurisdiction. Can it be said in that case that 
the execution of the decree be transmitted to the Banking 
Court for further proceedings? Clearly the answer to this 
question is in the negative and the proceedings will be held in 
the High Court which passed the decree in the first 
place………  
10.       Thus, the Division Bench of this Court held that the 
Banking Court which initially assumed the jurisdiction on the 
basis of the value fixed by the decree holder in the plaint was 
the only forum which had the pecuniary jurisdiction to execute 
the decree and to decide all ancillary matters relating to the 
execution, discharge and satisfaction of the decree.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
In a case cited as mashraq Bank Vs. Messrs Amtul Rehman 
Industries (Pvt.) Limited and others (2002 CLD 336), this Court 
has also held that the forum of execution of the decree under 
Section 19 of the Ordinance ibid is the Court which has passed 
the decree in a suit even though amount decreed was less than its 
pecuniary jurisdiction. For ready reference, relevant portion of 
the judgment (supra) is reproduced as under: 
 “6.     In view of the case-law cited by the learned counsel for 
both the parties I am of the considered view that the 
determining factor, for the purposes of jurisdiction, shall be the 
amount fixed by the plaintiff in the suit and on which amount 
the subject-matter of the suit has been valued. Once the 
plaintiff determines the value of the suit/ relief in the plaint 
that shall be conclusive for the purpose of determining the 
forum of appeal etc. 

 
E.F.A No.248622/2018

7.       In view of the above conclusions and findings I am of 
the considered view that this Court can neither entertain this 
execution petition nor undertake the execution proceedings on 
account of lack of pecuniary jurisdiction. In this case the 
Banking Court, which initially assumed the jurisdiction on the 
basis of the value fixed by the decree-holder in the plaint itself, 
is the only Court which has the pecuniary jurisdiction to 
execute the decree, to decide the other matters relating to the 
execution, discharge and satisfaction of the decree and to deal 
with all the ancillary matters relating thereto. The net result is 
that the objection of the learned counsel of the judgment-
debtors regarding the want of pecuniary jurisdiction prevails, 
thus, I am constrained to hold that this Court has no 
jurisdiction to try this execution petition and, therefore, the 
decree shall stand transferred to the Banking Court No.4, 
Lahore for its execution.” 
Another reliance is placed on a judgment titled as MCB Bank 
Limited Vs. Messrs Mazco Industries Private Limited and others 
(2023 CLD 410).  
6. 
As discussed above that this Court, as a Banking Court, 
has the jurisdiction to execute the judgment & decree passed by it 
irrespective of the quantum of amount so decreed as such the 
order dated 08.06.2021 (supra) passed in Exh.A.No.15133/2021 
titled as MCB Bank Limited Vs. Al-Hameed Rice Mills by the 
learned Single Judge in Chamber is not sustainable and hereby 
set aside. Furthermore, the judgment dated 06.06.2018 passed by 
the learned Division Bench in E.F.A No.1059/2016 titled as Zarai 
Taraqiati Bank Limited Vs. Faran Maiz Industries (Pvt.) Limited 
[relied upon by the learned Single Judge in Chamber while 
passing order dated 08.06.2021], being passed in violation of 
Section 19 of the Ordinance ibid as well as the settled principle of 
law, is per incuriam. Reliance in this regard is placed on cases 
cited as Muhammad Jawad Hamid Vs Mian Muhammad Nawaz 
Sharif & Others (PLD 2018 Lahore 836), Qaiser & Another Vs 
The State (2022 SCMR 1641).  

 
E.F.A No.248622/2018

The final resolve of the above is that the decree passed by 
the learned Banking Judge of this Court is liable to be exclusively 
executed by the said Court itself. 
6. 
The question referred to this Bench has been answered 
accordingly.

I agree with reasoning and conclusion 
recorded by both my brother judges.  

EFA No.248622/2018 
 
 
1 
Asim Hafeez, J. 
I have the privilege of reading the draft judgment handed 
down by my esteemed colleague, Ch. Muhammad Iqbal, J., I agree with the 
outcome of the adjudication and conclusion(s) drawn with respect to the 
question(s) referred for determination; however, I prefer to state my own 
reasons and analyses to substantiate the outcome / conclusion(s) reached. 
Putting into perspective, the controversy confronted is paraphrased 
hereunder:- 
‘what essentially is the criterion-cum-benchmark for determining 
the pecuniary jurisdiction of the Court executing the decree, be it a 
money decree, decree for foreclosure or sale of mortgage property 
or redemption thereof; and if at all, that determination is 
warranted in the context of special jurisdiction / law, in terms 
whereof decree(s) are sought to be executed’. 
2. 
Before discussing specifics, it is appropriate to give a rundown of the 
statutory framework, dealing with the execution-cum-transfer of decree(s), 
provided in Part-II of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (the ‘Code’). It is 
appropriate to reproduce the text(s) of relevant provisions, i.e., sections 37, 
38, 39 & 41 of the Code, to contextualize distinguishing features of special 
and general jurisdiction(s).  
Section 37- Definition of Court which passed a decree.- The expression “Court 
which passed a decree” or words to that effect, shall in relation to the execution 
of decrees unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context, be deemed 
to include, -- 
(a) 
where the decree to be executed has been passed in the exercise of 
appellate jurisdiction, the Court of first instance, and  
(b) 
where the Court of first instance has ceased to exist or to have 
jurisdiction to execute it, the Court which, if the suit wherein the decree 
was passed was instituted at the time of making the application for the 
execution of the decree, would have jurisdiction to try such suit. 
 
Section- 38. 
Courts by which decrees may be executed. --A decree may be 
executed either by the Court which passed it, or by the Court to which it is sent 
for execution. 
Section- 39. 
Transfer of decree -- (1) The Court which passed a decree may, on 
the application of the decree-holder, send it for execution to another Court, -- 
(a) 
if the person against whom the decree is passed actually and 
voluntarily resides or carries on business, or personally works for gain, 
within the local limits of the jurisdiction of such other Court, or 
(b) 
if such person has no property within the local limits of the 
jurisdiction of the Court which passed the decree sufficient to satisfy such 
decree and has property within the local limits of the jurisdiction of such 
other Court, or 

EFA No.248622/2018 
 
 
2 
(c) 
if the decree directs the sale or delivery of immovable property 
situate outside the local limits of the jurisdiction of the Court which 
passed it, or 
(d) 
if the Court which passed the decree considers for any other 
reason, which it shall record in writing, that the decree should be executed 
by such other Court. 
(2) 
The Court which passed a decree may of its own motion send it for 
execution to any subordinate Court of competent jurisdiction. 
 
Section- 41. 
“Result of execution proceedings to be certified. -- The Court to 
which a decree is sent for execution shall certify to the Court which passed it the 
fact of such execution, or where the former Court fails to execute the same the 
circumstances attending such failure”. 
 
3. 
Section 37 describes the forum for the execution of decree in certain 
eventualities. Section 38 expands the footprint of the Court(s) for the 
purpose of execution of the decree – by introducing a transferee court. Sub-
section (1) of Section 39 extends choice to the decree holder to seek transfer 
of decree, subject to the conditions provided in clauses (a) to (c) thereof. 
And sub-section (2) of section 39 envisages transfer by the Court on its own 
initiative. Section 41 obligates transferee court to certify result to the 
transferor Court.  
  
Context changes everything. It is significant to emphasize that matter 
at hand arose out of the proceedings, initiated and are continuing, under the 
special jurisdiction, extended in terms of the Financial Institution (Recovery 
of Finances) Ordinance, 2001 (the ‘Ordinance, 2001’). Unlike, the 
mechanism provided in the Code for initiation of proceedings for the 
execution of the decree, sub-section (1) of section 19 of the Ordinance, 2001 
provides a conduit between the suit proceedings and execution proceedings, 
whereby character of the former proceedings converts into latter, upon 
pronouncement of the Judgment and decree. In essence, under the special 
jurisdiction, one set of proceedings changes shade, ipso-facto through the 
operation of law / involuntarily – from pre-decretal proceedings to post-
decretal proceedings – in contrast to the mechanism available under the 
Code. It is elaborated that pre-decretal proceedings envisage process where a 
case/suit/action is brought before the Court of competent jurisdiction for 
adjudication of a specified claim [which is an ‘unadjudicated claim’]. And 
upon adjudication, such claims, unless dismissed; either accepted partly or 

EFA No.248622/2018 
 
 
3 
fully through a judicial pronouncement, assume the status of an ‘adjudicated 
claim / decreed claim’. Choice exercised and assumption of jurisdiction by 
the Court of competent jurisdiction, is dependent upon addressing various 
jurisdictional qualifying standards, statutorily defined – which have no 
proximity to the controversy. Pecuniary jurisdiction, other than the 
territorial, subject matter and status-based jurisdiction, is relevant for the 
purposes of present controversy. Significance and benchmark criterion for 
determination of pecuniary jurisdiction of a particular court is determinable 
at the time of presentation of the plaint or entertaining an action or a suit. 
There is no uncertainty or ambiguity that pecuniary jurisdiction of the court, 
entertaining an action / suit, is determined on the basis of the value of the 
relief claimed, nevertheless subject to correction by the Court in case of 
alleged manipulation through under-valuation or over-valuation. Under the 
Ordinance, 2001 pecuniary limits are prescribed in terms of section 2 (b) of 
the Ordinance, 2001, which provides the forum(s) of the Banking Court, 
established under section 5 of the Ordinance, 2001, or the High Court, as the 
case may be – pecuniary limits defined in clauses (i) and (ii) of sub-section 
(b) of section 2 of the Ordinance, 2001 are reproduced, –  after enhancement 
in consequence of the Financial Institution (Recovery of Finances) 
Amendment Act, 2016 (Amendment Act, 2016).  Section 2 (b) reads as,  
 
2(b) “Banking Court” means— 
(i) 
in respect of a case in which the claim does not exceed 
hundred million rupees or for the trial of offences under 
this Ordinance, the Court established under Section 5: 
and 
(ii) 
in respect of any other case, the High Court”. 
 
4. 
There is no dispute regarding mechanism for determination of the 
pecuniary jurisdiction of competent forum for entertaining the case / suit. An 
obvious question that stirs curiosity is; if at all it is imperative that 
adjudicated claim / decreed amount must also fall within the pecuniary limits 
of the forum, prescribed under section 2(b)(i) & (ii) of the Ordinance, 2001, 
tasked with the execution of the decree; or Whether pecuniary jurisdiction of 
the Court executing the decree needs to be re-visited to ensure that quantum 

EFA No.248622/2018 
 
 
4 
of adjudicated claim / decreed amount must come within the pecuniary 
limits of the Court, before giving effect to the decree.  
  
Apparently, no such re-determination of pecuniary limits is required 
under special jurisdiction, since one form of proceedings stood involuntarily 
converted into the other form of proceedings, under the mandate of sub-
section (1) of section 19 of the Ordinance, 2001. Uncertainty in fact 
intensified in wake of the decision, dated 06.06.2018, in the case of Zarai 
Taraqiati Bank Limited v. Faran Maiz Industries (Pvt) Ltd. (“EFA 
No.1059/2016”), wherein learned Division Bench of this Court had affirmed 
the decision of transfer of decree from the High Court, which passed the 
decree, to the Banking Court, established under section 5 of the Ordinance, 
2001, for the purpose of execution, on the premise that quantum of 
adjudicated claim / decreed amount of Rs.75.425 Million, fell below the 
revised pecuniary jurisdiction of the High Court – enhanced to deal with 
claims over Rs.100.000 Million. Learned Division Bench of this Court 
arrived at this conclusion upon interpreting the expression ‘claim’, while 
holding that claim of the financial institution – [Appellant of EFA 
No.1059/2016] - raised in the suit / case was adjudicated and stood 
embodied in the decree, which claim had to be executed by the Banking 
Court and not the High Court, since adjudicated claim was below the 
prescribed pecuniary limit of the High Court, notwithstanding the fact that 
decree was passed by the High Court. Learned Division Bench in fact treated 
the decretal amount (adjudicated claim) as benchmark for determining the 
pecuniary jurisdiction of the Executing Court – conspicuously drawing 
distinction between an unadjudicated claim, before pronouncement of 
decree, and an adjudicated claim, upon the pronouncement of judgment and 
decree. Decision in the case of Faran Maiz Industries (Pvt) Ltd. (supra) 
reiterated the line of reasoning explicated in the case of HABIB BANK 
LIMITED through Attorneys v. Messrs REHMANIA TEXTILE MILLS (PVT.) 
LTD., JHANG ROAD FAISALBAD and 30 others’ (2003 CLD 689), though 
no reference was made to an earlier decision.  
5. 
This conspicuous segregation between an unadjudicated claim and an 
adjudicated claim, for the purposes of determining the pecuniary jurisdiction 
of the Court executing the decree, is the sticking point. And an ancillary 

EFA No.248622/2018 
 
 
5 
question, but equally significant, is that if at all such segregation is 
essentially warranted under special jurisdiction – Ordinance, 2001. Before 
analyzing the rationality and legality of apparent segregation in the case of 
Faran Maiz Industries (Pvt) Ltd. (supra), it is appropriate to briefly touch 
upon background facts and context of the orders assailed through appeals, 
respectively filed by a financial institution [decree holder] and customer 
[judgment debtor]. In the order impugned through appeal bearing EFA 
No.248622/2018, [which arose out of Ex.A. No.221429 of 2018], High 
Court, which passed the decree and was executing it, after conversion of suit 
proceedings upon pronouncement of judgment, had dismissed the objections 
by the Judgment Debtor therein, who pleaded absence of pecuniary 
jurisdiction on the premise that adjudicated claim [decreed amount] fell 
below the defined pecuniary limit of the High Court, which was enhanced as 
consequence of the Amendment Act 2016. It was held that notwithstanding 
change in the pecuniary jurisdiction, decree would be executed by the Court, 
which had passed it, and the reasoning put forward was that pecuniary 
jurisdiction of the Executing Court would be determined on the basis of 
original valuation of the suit, and not with reference to decreed amount or 
adjudicated claim. Later, in another case, which is Ex. A. No.15133/2021, 
while passing order dated 08.06.2021, which is subject matter of EFA 
No.43805/2021, High Court directed transfer of the decree, in contrast to an 
earlier decision, while placing reliance on the decision of learned Division 
Bench in the case of Faran Maiz Industries (Pvt) Ltd. (supra). Hence, in real 
terms it is the ratio of the decision in the case of Faran Maiz Industries (Pvt) 
Ltd. (supra) that needs judicial scrutiny by this Full Bench, constituted 
pursuant to expression of diverging observations recorded in order of 
18.12.2018, passed in EFA No.248622/2018. 
6. 
Controversy narrated, for the sake of further simplification, is 
dissected into two broader legal propositions; firstly, whether the Ordinance, 
2001 permits re-visiting / re-determining of the pecuniary jurisdiction of 
Court of first instance upon conversion of character of the proceedings, from 
proceedings of the suit to proceedings for execution of the decree, and in the 
context of the claim, from an unadjudicated to an adjudicated claim (‘first 
proposition’).  

EFA No.248622/2018 
 
 
6 
And secondly, would it materially affect the jurisdiction of the High 
Court, executing an adjudicated claim, when such adjudicated claim / 
decreed amount fell below the pecuniary limit threshold of the Court, which 
passed the decree due to change in the pecuniary jurisdiction or otherwise, 
notwithstanding the fact that at the time of filing of the suit an unadjudicated 
claim, for the purpose of valuation of the suit, was within the pecuniary 
limits of the Court of first instance. (‘second proposition’). 
7. 
Unlike procedural requirements available and required to be followed 
while seeking execution of the decree under the Code, continuity, by 
operation of law, was extended to suit proceedings upon pronouncement of 
judgment and decree by the Banking Court, which expression is 
interchangeably employed to identify the Court of competent jurisdiction, in 
the context of pecuniary limits defined under section 2(b) of the Ordinance, 
2001. This self-executing mechanism, triggered and effected spontaneously 
upon pronouncement of judgment, unequivocally absolve the decree holder 
of the requirements of filling separate application and necessity of issuance 
of fresh notice. Section 19 of the Ordinance, 2001 is reproduced for ease of 
reference, 
 
“Section 19(1).- Upon pronouncement of judgment and decree by a Banking 
Court, the suit shall automatically stand converted into execution proceedings 
without the need to file a separate application and no fresh notice need be issued 
to the judgment-debtor in this regard. Particulars of the mortgaged, pledged or 
hypothecated property and other assets of the judgment-debtor shall be filed by 
the decree-holder for consideration of the Banking Court and the case will be 
heard by the Banking Court for execution of its decree on the expiry of 30 days 
from the date of pronouncement of judgment and decree: 
Provided that if the record of the suit is summoned at any stage by the High 
Court for purposes of hearing an appeal under Section 22 or otherwise, 
copies of the decree and other property documents shall be retained by the 
Banking Court for purpose of continuing the execution proceedings. 
(2) 
The decree of the Banking Court shall be executed in accordance 
with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Act V of 1908) or 
any other law for the time being in force or in such manner as the Banking 
Court may at the request of the decree-holder consider appropriate, 
including recovery as arrears of land revenue”. 
8. 
Claim of re-evaluation or re-determination of pecuniary jurisdiction of 
the Court, which assumed jurisdiction to execute the decree under the 
mandate of the law, tantamount to defeat the very purpose and objective of 
dispensing with the necessity of any overt act on the part of the decree 

EFA No.248622/2018

holder. Mere use of the expression ‘Banking Court’ cannot be erroneously 
construed to mean Banking Court, exclusively established under section 5 of 
the Ordinance, 2001 but certainly includes the High Court, depending upon 
the quantum or value of an unascertained claim or otherwise. The expression 
‘Banking Court’ employed throughout the Ordinance, 2001 has to be 
construed and interpreted with reference to the context and relevance 
thereto. This aspect of the matter was not deliberated in the case of Faran 
Maiz Industries (Pvt) Ltd. (supra), and Messrs REHMANIA TEXTILE MILLS 
(PVT.) LTD., JHANG ROAD FAISALBAD and 30 others (supra) - former 
decision was passed after promulgation of Amendment Act 2016, which 
altered the pecuniary limits of the Courts [which in the context of subject 
matter controversy means Banking Court, established under section 5 of the 
Ordinance, 2001 and High Court, enjoying Special jurisdiction under the 
Ordinance, 2001].  
Question that whether change in the pecuniary jurisdiction of the 
Court, after the passing of decree and for the purposes of execution of the 
decree, would suggest or imply that the court of first instance has ceased to 
exist or ceased to have jurisdiction to execute it – contingency(ies) provided 
in terms of clause (b) of section 37 of the Code -, may not be relevant for the 
purpose of deciding the matter at hand, in wake of explicitly clear legislative 
mandate contained in sub-section (1) of section 19 of the Ordinance, 2001. 
Aforesaid question is left untouched and to be adjudicated in some other 
case, where interpretation of clause (b) of section 37 of the Code is sought, 
in isolation. There is another minor issue but worth an explanation. Is the 
decree passed executable under the provisions of the Ordinance, 2001 or the 
Code. Section 4 of the Ordinance, 2001 gives an overriding effect to the 
Ordinance. Clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 7 of the Ordinance, 2001 
provides that subject to the provisions of this Ordinance, a Banking Court 
shall in the exercise of its civil jurisdiction have all the powers vested in a 
civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Sub-section (2) of 
Section 19 envisages that decree shall be executed in accordance with the 
provisions of the Code or any other law for the time being in force or in such 
manner the Banking Court at the request of decree-holder consider(s) it 
appropriate. There appears conspicuous digression in the procedure for 

EFA No.248622/2018

initiation and commencement of proceedings for seeking execution of the 
decree under the Code and the Ordinance, 2001 and special law / jurisdiction 
claims preference, in terms of the jurisprudence evolved over the years and 
followed, consistently. Effect of automatic conversion of suit into execution 
was amply illustrated in the case of MCB Bank Limited through duly 
authorized attorney V. EDEN Developers (Pvt.) Limited and others (2019 
CLD 219). Question that whether quantum of adjudicated claim / decreed 
amount is one of the factors for determinability of pecuniary jurisdiction of 
the court executing the decree came up for adjudication in the cases of 
Messrs United Bank Ltd. V. Mst. Rehana Raza (PLD 1983 Karachi 467) and 
National Bank of Pakistan V. Bawany Industries Ltd. (PLD 1983 Karachi 
300), and were decided in the context of sub-section 6 (4) of the Banking 
Companies (Recovery of Loans) Ordinance, 1979 (XIX of 1979), which 
provision of law is reproduced hereunder for ease of reference and 
understanding, 
Section 6. Powers of Special Court. - (1) A Special Court shall  
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
(2) ……… 
(3) ………  
(4) 
No Court other than a Special Court shall have or exercise any 
jurisdiction with respect to any matter to which the jurisdiction of Special Court 
extends under this Ordinance, including a decision to the existence or otherwise 
of a loan and the execution of a decree passed by a Special Court; and all 
proceedings, including proceedings following the filing of an arbitration award 
and proceedings for the execution of a decree within the jurisdiction of a 
Special Court, by whatever Court passed, which may be pending in any Court 
immediately before the commencing day shall stand transferred to the Special 
Court. 
[Emphasis supplied] 
There is a marked difference between the legislative command 
manifested through section 6(4) of the Ordinance, 1979 and mechanism of 
conversion of proceedings provided under section 19(1) of the Ordinance, 
2001 – hence decisions in the cases of Mst. Rehana Raza (supra) and 
Bawany Industries Ltd. (supra) are not relevant. 

EFA No.248622/2018

9. 
In view of the aforesaid discussion I conclude that, under the 
Ordinance, 2001, suit proceedings would stand converted into execution by 
the operation of law, upon pronouncement of the judgment and decree, and 
the Court which had pronounced the judgment is obligated to act and 
exercise jurisdiction to execute the decree, without the necessity of re-
visiting or re-determining its own pecuniary jurisdiction in the context of 
quantum of an adjudicated claim / decreed amount. Judgments referred 
including decisions of the Courts from our eastern neighbour, largely discuss 
issues of pecuniary jurisdiction in the context of section 6 of the Code and 
issues encountered by the court of first instance at the time of presentation of 
the plaint(s), which decisions may have had relevance to facts involved 
therein but all such decisions are evidently distinguishable in the context of 
sub-section (1) of section 19 of the Ordinance,2001. Effect of ratio of 
decisions in the cases of Faran Maiz Industries (Pvt) Ltd. (supra), or Messrs 
REHMANIA TEXTILE MILLS (PVT.) LTD., JHANG ROAD FAISALBAD 
and 30 others (supra) are already discussed in detail.     
10.  
First proposition is answered in negative.  
11. 
I am of the opinion that while addressing first legal proposition, 
second proposition is addressed substantially but still it requires brief 
discussion for the reason that specific question was raised while drafting 
order of 18.12.2019, which necessitated formation of instant Full Bench. 
Part of the order, to the extent of having relevancy to second proposition, is 
reproduced hereunder,  
“2. According to the view point of this Bench, the basis for determining the 
pecuniary jurisdiction of the executing court under the Financial 
Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance, 2001, would be the amount 
that was fixed by the plaintiff in the suit on which the subject-matter of the 
suit was valued. Once the plaintiff has determined the value of the 
suit/relief in the plaint that would be conclusive for the purposes of 
determining the forum of execution. Therefore, the issue before this Bench 
is whether the Court which initially assumed the jurisdiction on the basis of 
the value fixed by the Decree Holder in the plaint itself, would be the only 
Court which has the pecuniary jurisdiction to execute the decree and to 
decide other matters relating to the execution, discharge and satisfaction of 
the decree. 
3. As in this particular case it has also been argued by the 
respondent/decree holder that even its claim in execution is for an amount 
of more than Rs.100 million, with Rs.9,06,39,457.34 being the principal 
and mark-up granted under the decree, and Rs.1,77,32,057.78 being the 

EFA No.248622/2018 
 
 
10
cost of funds already accrued in terms of the decree at the time of filing of 
execution, thus, another issue for determination before this Court is 
whether the sum of cost of funds that had accrued to the Decree holder till 
the date of the decree will be considered as a component of the decretal 
amount in order to reach the exact sum of the decretal amount in case it is 
finally declared by this Bench that the decretal amount would be the basis 
to determine the pecuniary jurisdiction of the executing court.” 
12. 
At the cost of repetition, it is stated that in the case of Faran Maiz 
Industries (Pvt) Ltd. (supra), execution proceedings were transferred on the 
premise that adjudicated claim / decreed amount fell below the pecuniary 
limits of the High Court that had passed the decree. Learned Division Bench 
of this Court had erroneously benchmarked the quantum of an adjudicated 
claim as the basis of ascertaining pecuniary jurisdiction of the court 
executing the decree – consequence of non-consideration of the effect of 
section 19(1) of the Ordinance, 2001 while rendering judgment in the case of 
Faran Maiz Industries (Pvt) Ltd. (supra) was discussed earlier. Now I 
highlight the fact that why such interpretation of the provisions of 
Ordinance, 2001 in general and section 2(b) thereof, in particular, was 
otherwise impractical, irrational and unenforceable. Learned Division Bench 
had not considered the effect and consequences of provision of Interim 
Decree. One must not overlook the option of ‘Interim Decree’ in an 
appropriate case, which is per se executable under section 11 of the 
Ordinance 2001. Now, if the quantum of Interim Decree is below the 
pecuniary limit of the High Court, would decree be transferred for execution 
to the Banking Court, established under section 5 of the Ordinance, 2001. 
This would create an anomalous situation, where proceeding to execute 
Interim Decree would proceed before the Banking Court, – established under 
section 5 of the Ordinance, 2001, – and other part of the lis would be 
pending before the High Court. Whether the High Court would direct re-
transfer of Interim Decree, at the time of passing of final judgment. This 
hypothetical prospect appears impractical and unwarranted.  
  
Let the scenario of irrationality of ratio of precedent be explained 
through a simple illustration. A suit brought by the Financial Institution 
under section 9 of the FIO, 2001, wherein claim raised was Rs.95.000 
Million (an ‘unadjudicated claim’), was triable by the High Court, before 
alteration in the limit of pecuniary jurisdiction through Amendment Act, 
2016. An unadjudicated claim was adjudicated and decree of Rs.95.000 

EFA No.248622/2018 
 
 
11
Million was passed, which inter alia included decree for the Cost of Funds, 
calculable from the date of the default. Presumably, after passing of the 
decree, the pecuniary jurisdiction of the High Court was raised from 
Rs.50.00 Million to Rs.100.00 Million. In terms of sub-section (1) of section 
19 of the Ordinance, 2001, upon lapse of one month of the pronouncement 
of judgment, suit proceedings per se stood converted into execution 
proceedings. Now, the decree holder, while submitting details of the 
mortgaged / hypothecated property, submits summary of recoverable amount 
– inclusive of decreed amount or Rs.95.000 Million and Cost of Funds, till 
the date, accumulated to Rs.7.00 Million – and value thereof goes over 
Rs.100.000 Million. If we go by the ratio of decision in the precedent case, 
i.e., Faran Maiz Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. (supra) whether decree would be 
executed by the High Court [since upon adding component of cost of funds 
the adjudicated claim goes beyond pecuniary limit of Rs.100.000 Million] or 
decree was executable by the Banking Court established under Section 5 of 
the Ordinance, 2001, since the original decree was less than the limit of 
Rs.100.000 Million. Composite decree was for Rs.102.000 Million. 
Assuming the ratio of precedent case, Whether High Court, before executing 
the decree, would consider the amount originally decreed as benchmark for 
determining its pecuniary jurisdiction, or proceed to determine it based on 
the quantum of recoverable amount, inclusive of the Cost of Funds – this 
query is answered in following paragraph after explaining the scope of Cost 
of Funds.  
  
Cost of Funds is deemed as part of the decree. It is expedient to 
reproduce section 3 of the Ordinance, 2001 – sub-section (3) thereof bears 
proximity to the illustration-,      
“3. 
Duty of a Customer.--(1) It shall be the duty of a customer to fulfil 
his obligation to the financial institution. 
(2) 
Where the customer defaults in the discharge of his obligation, he 
shall be liable to pay, for the period from the date of his default till 
realization of the cost of funds of the financial institution as certified by the 
State Bank of Pakistan from time to time, apart from such other civil and 
criminal liabilities that he may incur under the contract or rules or any 
other law for the time being in force. 
(3) 
For purposes of this section a judgment against a customer under 
this Ordinance, shall mean that he is in default of his duty under sub-

EFA No.248622/2018 
 
 
12
section (1), and the ensuing decree shall provide for payment of the cost of 
funds as determined under sub-section (2)”. 
13. 
Since Cost of Funds forms part of the ensuing decree therefore, the 
High Court, irrespective of decreed amount of below pecuniary jurisdiction, 
would execute it in accordance with the mandate of sub-section (1) of 
section 19 of the Ordinance, 2001, since it had passed the decree. Even 
otherwise component of Cost of Funds increases with continuing default, 
which makes recoverable amount flexible, subject to increase with passing 
days. Such flexibility in the quantum of recoverable amount under the 
decree is contrary to the interpretation of Section 2(b) of the Ordinance, 
2001 in the case of Faran Maiz Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. (supra). This scenario 
renders the necessity of re-visiting the pecuniary jurisdiction by the High 
Court while executing the decree unfeasible and irrational, besides being 
contrary to automatic conversion mechanism provided under Special 
jurisdiction. Evidently, legislature, in its wisdom, had rightly absolved the 
Court executing the decree to re-visit or re-determine its pecuniary 
jurisdiction while giving effect to the decree under the Ordinance, 2001.  
14. 
There is another aspect touching the question of transfer of decree by 
the Banking Court to another court, notwithstanding it had passed the 
decree. Ordinance, 2001 envisages possibility of transfer of decree. Sub-
section (2) of section 19 of the Ordinance, 2001 provides an option to the 
decree holder to seek execution of the decree in any manner considers 
appropriate, which indicates that subject to the Ordinance, 2001, decree 
holder may seek transfer of decree by Banking Court on the grounds 
provided in sub-section (1) of section 39 of the Code. Since order of 
08.06.2021, subject matter of EFA No.43805/2021, whereby, while 
following the ratio of decision in precedent case, Faran Maiz Industries 
(Pvt) Ltd. (supra), execution proceedings were transferred in the wake of 
altered pecuniary limits, therefore clause (d) of section 39 of the Code and 
sub-section (2) of section 39 of the Code – suo-moto jurisdiction of the 
Court – need no discussion in the context of the facts raised in appeals and 
scope of the question referred to this Full Bench. In wake of facts alleged, it 
was not the case of voluntary transfer of decree. 

EFA No.248622/2018 
 
 
13
15. 
Hence, jurisdiction of the High Court to execute the decree, upon 
conversion, would not be affected notwithstanding the fact that adjudicated 
claim / decreed amount fell below the pecuniary limits of the High Court, 
that passed the decree.     
16. 
Second proposition is also answered in negative. 
17. 
In view of the question(s) answered, order dated 16.10.2018, subject 
matter of EFA No.248622/2018 is affirmed and appeal is dismissed.  And 
order of 08.06.2021, impugned through EFA No.43805/2021, is set-aside in 
consequence of declaring the decision in the case of Faran Maiz Industries 
(Pvt) Ltd. (supra) contrary to the law, hence, per-incuriam. Consequently, 
EFA No.43805/2021 is allowed. 
18. 
Reference is decided in aforesaid terms.
