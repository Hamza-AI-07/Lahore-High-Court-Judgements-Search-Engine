Muhammad Ameen A.S.I. and record of the case.  
 
Mian Tariq Manzoor, Advocate for complainant of the case/ 
respondent No.2 in the petition.  
 
 
  
This single consolidated order will dispose of two petitions                     
i.e. petition for grant of pre-arrest bail filed by Ghulam Rasool, Ghulam Hussain and 
Qurban Ali (petitioners/accused persons) bearing “Crl. Misc. No.47626-B/2023” and 
petition for grant of post arrest bail filed by Zarina Bibi (petitioner/ accused) bearing 
“Crl. Misc. No.50846-B/2023”, as both aforementioned petitions have been filed in 
the case arising out of one and same F.I.R. No.234/2023 dated: 11.06.2023 registered 
under Sections: 302, 148, 149 PPC at Police Station: Chutiyana, District: Toba Tek 
Singh.  
2.   
 
Learned counsel for the petitioners, after having argued the case at full 
length, does not press Crl. Misc. No.47626-B/2023 to the extent of Ghulam Rasool and 
Qurban Ali (petitioners No.1 and 3, respectively); therefore, said petition to their 
extent is dismissed as not pressed and ad-interim pre-arrest bail already granted to 
them by this Court vide order dated: 18.07.2023, is hereby recalled.  
3. 
  
After hearing learned counsel for the parties, learned Assistant 
District Public Prosecutor and going through the available record with their 
able assistance, it has been noticed that briefly, as per Crime Report (F.I.R.), at 
11:30 p.m. (night) on 10.06.2023, Allah Ditta (complainant of the case), his sons 
namely Arsalan, Imran along with wife namely Mst. Shamshad Bibi and guests 
Muhammad Zain and Muhammad Afzal were sitting in the guest room (بیٹھک), 
Ghulam Rasool alias Kala (accused) came, called Arsalan (son of the complainant) 
and took him away; when after passage of sufficient time, Arsalan did not come 
back, complainant along with his wife and witnesses including Muhammad Zain 
and Muhammad Afzal started searching  him, reached at the house of Zarina Bibi  
(accused/petitioner in Crl. Misc. No.50846-B/2023) wife of Ghulam Abbas and saw 
that in the street, persons residents of the vicinity were gathered there, outer door of 

  
 
 
Crl. Misc. No.47626-B/2023 & 
  
2 
Crl. Misc. No.50846-B/2023 
the house was opened and voices of hue and cry of son of the complainant were 
coming from inside; complainant along with witnesses at 02:30 a.m. (night) went 
inside the house of Zarina Bibi, saw that bulb was litting in the courtyard, one 
unknown and Zarina Bibi while catching arms of son of the complainant whereas 
another unknown while catching his both legs had laid down son of the complainant 
from back side (
 الٹا لیٹا رکھا
تھا) in the courtyard of the house and his shirt was put off, 
accused persons namely Ghulam Rasool, Qurban Ali and Ramzan were giving 
merciless beating with sticks to Arsalan, who was raising hue and cry; complainant 
and witnesses beseeched the accused persons for rescue of Arsalan upon which, 
Muhammad Ramzan raised lalkara that they would also be murdered if they 
intervened and kept continued giving beating to Arsalan; Muhammad Raman and 
Qurban Ali gave beating to Arsalan at back of his chest and shoulders whereas 
Ghulam Rasool gave beating at random with stick at buttocks, thighs and his legs; 
Arslan also received various injuries on different parts of his body including face, 
arms etc.; call was made to the police on 15 and while coming to know about arrival 
of the police, accused persons fled away; Arsalan was carried in injured condition 
and being taken to Rural Health Center, however, he succumbed to the injuries on 
the way; motive behind the occurrence was that Zarina Bibi and brothers of her 
husband were having suspicion that Arsalan was having friendship with Misbah 
daughter of Zarina Bibi.  
 
 
So far as case of Ghulam Hussain (petitioner No.2 in Crl. Misc. 
No.47626-B/2023) is concerned, suffice it to say that any role of said Ghulam 
Hussain is not mentioned in the Crime Report (F.I.R.). On Court’s query, learned 
Assistant District Public Prosecutor under instructions of Investigating Officer 
(present in Court) and after herself going through the record apprises that 
complainant has even not given any supplementary statement to the extent of any 
role of Ghulam Hussain in the occurrence; further apprises that in the statements of 
eyewitnesses including Muhammad Zain, Muhammad Afzal and Shamshad Bibi 
recorded under Section: 161 Cr.P.C., name of Ghulam Hussain as accused has not 
been mentioned; also adds that nothing is to be recovered from him. Therefore, 
reasonable grounds are not available on record to connect Ghulam Hussain with the 
commission of alleged offences rather case of prosecution to his extent requires 
further probe/inquiry and falls in the ambit of Section: 497 (2) Cr.P.C.  When 
aforementioned circumstances are visualized in totality, then arraying Ghulam 
Hussain in the case as accused by the complainant in connivance with the police 
through widening of net with mala fide intention, cannot be outrightly ruled out. In 
abovementioned circumstances, insistence of the Investigating Officer/police for 
arrest of accused is itself sufficient to reflect malafide on part of prosecution and 
accused in such circumstances is not required to produce any other evidence to

prove the same; in this regard, guidance has been sought from the case of 
“SHAHZADA QAISER ARFAT alias QAISER Vs The STATE and 
another”(PLD 2021 Supreme Court 708); relevant portions whereof are hereby 
reproduced: - 
 
“4. …………………………………..…..………………………………………… 
The learned High Court did not appreciate that the “malafide” being a 
state of mind cannot always be proved through direct evidence, and it is 
often to be inferred from the facts and circumstances of the case.2” 
 
 
“6. The power of the High Courts and the Courts of Sessions to grant 
pre-arrest bail, first and foremost, must be examined in the constitutional 
context of liberty, dignity, due process and fair trial. Prearrest bail is in 
the nature of a check on the police power to arrest a person. The non-
availability of incriminating material against the accused or non-
existence of a sufficient ground including a valid purpose4 for making 
arrest of the accused person in a case by the investigating officer would 
as a corollary be a ground for admitting the accused to pre-arrest bail, 
and vice versa.5 Reluctance of the courts in admitting the accused 
persons to pre-arrest bail by treating such a relief as an extraordinary 
one without examining whether there is sufficient incriminating material 
available on record to connect the accused with the commission of the 
alleged offence and for what purpose his arrest and detention is required 
during investigation or trial of the case, and their insistence only on 
showing malafide on part of the complainant or the Police for granting 
pre-arrest bail does not appear to be correct, especially after recognition 
of the right to fair trial as a fundamental right under Article 10A of 
Constitution of Pakistan, 1973.6 Protection against  arbitrary arrest and 
detention is part of the right to liberty and fair trial.7 This Court has, in 
many cases8 granted pre-arrest bail to accused persons after finding that 
there are no reasonable grounds for believing their involvement in the 
commission of the alleged offences and has not required independent 
proof of malafide on part of the Police or the complainant before 
granting such relief.9 Despite non-availability of the incriminating 
material against the accused, his implication by the complainant and 
the insistence of the Police to arrest him are the circumstances which 
by themselves indicate the malafide on the part of the complainant and 
the Police, and the accused need not lead any other evidence to prove 
malafide on their part.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    (emphasis added)                          
 
                   
In view of what has been discussed above, petition for pre-arrest bail bearing Crl. 
Misc. No.47626-B/2023 to the extent of Ghulam Hussain (petitioner No.2) is 
allowed and ad-interim pre-arrest bail already granted to him by this Court vide order  
dated: 18.07.2023 is confirmed subject to his furnishing fresh bail bonds in the sum of 
Rs.300,000/- (Rupees three hundred thousand only) with one surety in the like 
amount to the satisfaction of trial court within a period of fifteen days from today.  
  
 
Now coming to the case of Zarina Bibi (petitioner in Crl. Misc. 
No.50846-B/2023, hereinafter to be referred as “petitioner”); as per case of 
prosecution, she was neither equipped with any weapon nor caused any injury to the 
deceased of the case rather there is allegation against her that she along with one 

  
 
 
Crl. Misc. No.47626-B/2023 & 
  
4 
Crl. Misc. No.50846-B/2023 
unknown accused caught hold Arsalan (deceased of the case) from his arms. In the 
peculiar facts and circumstances, when number of accused persons were present at 
the spot for commission of the alleged occurrence and another person was also 
catching arms of the deceased of the case, then whether it was necessary for Zarina 
Bibi to catch arms of the deceased, is the question which would be answered by the 
trial court after recording of evidence and furthermore, vicarious lability of the 
petitioner would also be seen during trial of the case. Nothing has been recovered 
from the petitioner. Admittedly, petitioner is a woman and her case falls in the first 
proviso to Section: 497 (1) Cr.P.C. By now it is well settled that even in the cases 
falling in the prohibition contained in Section: 497 Cr.P.C. grant of bail to a woman 
is a rule and refusal is an exception, however, any material could not be referred by 
the prosecution to bring case of the petitioner for invoking said exception; in this 
regard, guidance has been sought from the case of “Mst. GHAZALA versus The 
STATE and another” (2023 S C M R 887) and relevant portion of said case law is 
hereby reproduced: - 
“4.  
No doubt, the offence of Qail-i-amd (intentional murder) punishable 
under section 302, P.P.C. alleged against the petitioner falls within the 
prohibitory clause of section 497(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
1898 ("Cr.P.C.") but being a women, the petitioner's case is covered by the 
first proviso to section 497(1), Cr.P.C. The said proviso, as held in Tahira 
Batool case,' makes the power of the court to grant bail in the offences of 
prohibitory clause of section 497(1) alleged against an accused under the 
age of sixteen years, a woman accused and a sick or infirm accused, equal 
to its power under the first part of section 497(1), Cr.P.C. It means that in 
cases of women accused etc. as mentioned in the first proviso to section 
497(1), irrespective of the category of the offence, the bail is to be granted 
as a rule and refused only as an exception in the same manner as it is 
granted or refused in offences that do not fall within the prohibitory clause 
of section 497(1), Cr.P.C. The exceptions that justify the refusal of bail are 
also well settled by several judgments of this Court. 2They are the likelihood 
of the accused, if released on bail: (i) to abscond to escape trial; (ii) to 
tamper with the prosecution evidence or influence the prosecution witnesses 
to obstruct the course of justice; and (iii) to repeat the offence. 
5.  
That being the legal position, we have asked the learned Additional 
Advocate General and the learned counsel for the complainant to show how 
the petitioner's case falls in any of the said three well-established 
exceptions. They, however, could not explain and satisfy the Court as to 
which one of the said exceptions is attracted to the petitioner's case. Their 
only response was that there is a sufficient incriminating material available 
on record of the case to connect the petitioner with the commission of the 
alleged offence. We are afraid, the response is misconceived.” 
 
Petitioner was arrested in the case on 18.06.2023, sent to jail on the same day and 
is behind the bars since then; challan report already stands submitted in the Court; 
no useful purpose would be served to the case of prosecution by keeping the 
petitioner in jail for an indefinite period and it is trite law that bail cannot be 
withheld as advance punishment. Even otherwise bail is a procedural relief i.e. 
mere change of custody from State to surety and has no bearing on ultimate fate of 
the case.  
 

Crl. Misc. No.47626-B/2023 &

Crl. Misc. No.50846-B/2023 
 
 
  
 
Liberty of a person is a precious right which has been guaranteed by 
the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. By now it is also well 
settled that it is better to err in granting bail than to err in refusal because ultimate 
conviction and sentence can repair the wrong resulted by a mistaken relief of bail; 
in this regard, case of “CHAIRMAN, NATIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY 
BUREAU through P.G., NAB versus NISAR AHMED PATHAN and others” 
(PLD 2022 Supreme Court 475) can be safely referred and its relevant portion 
from Page No(s).480-481 is reproduced: - 
“To err in granting bail is better than to err in declining; for the 
ultimate conviction and sentence of a guilty person can repair the 
wrong caused by a mistaken relief of bail, but no satisfactory 
reparation can be offered to an innocent person on his acquittal for 
his unjustified imprisonment during the trial.” 
   
 
 
4.  
 
In view of above, Cr. Misc. No.50846-B/2023 filed by Zarina Bibi 
(petitioner) is accepted/allowed and she is admitted to post-arrest bail in the case 
subject to her furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.3,00,000/- (Rupees three 
hundred thousand only) with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of 
trial court.  
5. 
 
It goes without saying that observations mentioned above are just 
tentative in nature, strictly confined to the disposal of aforementioned petitions for 
bail and will have no bearing upon trial of the case, which would be decided on its 
own merits by the trial court expeditiously preferably within a period of four 
months after the receipt of attested copy of this order. Needless to add that if 
Ghulam Hussain, Zarina Bibi or any other person acting on their behalf will create 
any hurdle in the way of conclusion of trial, then complainant as well as the State 
would be at liberty to move for recalling of this order.
