Shahid Karim, J:-. The question at the heart of these 
constitutional petitions (W.P No.28985 of 2024 & W.P 
No.31120 of 2024) critically interrogates the meaning of 
section 140 of the Elections Act, 2017 (“the Act”). 
2. 
The narration of facts would lend actuality to the 
analysis.  The general elections to the National and 
Provincial Assemblies were held on 8th of February, 2024.  
On 14th of February, 2024 the Election Commission of 
Pakistan (ECP) wrote a letter to all the High Courts through 
the Registrars with the following request: 
“I am directed to draw your attention to Section-140 of 
the Elections Act, 2017 and to request that the matter may 
be placed before the Hon’ble Chief Justice with the 
request for the provisions of a list of Honourable serving 
Judges of the Hon’ble High Courts for their appointment 
as Election Tribunals for hearing & decision of election 
petitions filed under Section 139 of the Election Act, 2017.  
It is also requested that a panel of Hon’ble serving Judges 
may be provided for the appointment of required number 
of Election Tribunals by the Commission at the principle 
seat and benches of the Hon’ble High Courts” 

W.P No.28985 of 2024

3. 
The letter set out above makes a request to Honourable 
Chief Justices of the four provincial High Courts “for the 
provision of a list of honorable serving Judges of the High 
Courts for their appointment as Election Tribunals”.  Further 
that “it is also requested that a panel of honorable serving 
Judges may be provided for the appointment of required 
number of Election Tribunals by the Commission at the 
Principal Seat and the Benches of the honorable High 
Courts”.  The letter does not spell out the required number 
of Election Tribunals which, in the estimation of ECP, were 
necessary to be appointed for different provinces to decide 
election petitions filed under Section 139 of the Act.  In the 
context of the Lahore High Court (LHC), the Hon’ble Chief 
Justice nominated two Honourable Judges for disposal of 
election petitions vide letter dated 20th of February, 2024.  
These were notified by ECP on 20.02.2024 without demur.  
It will be noted that ECP did so on the recommendations of 
the Chief Justice and proceeded to appoint the two Judges to 
act as Election Tribunals.  There was no further 
communication by ECP to its request made on 14.02.2024 
for a panel of Judges to be provided for being appointed as 
Election Tribunals.  By notification dated 7.3.2024 the 
Registrar of Lahore High Court assigned the areas to the 
Election Tribunals for the trial and disposal of election 
petitions.  In respect of Principal Seat and Rawalpindi 
Bench, a Judge was assigned the territorial jurisdiction to 
adjudicate and decide the election petitions. 
4. 
On 4.4.2024 another letter was addressed by the 
Registrar Lahore High Court to the Joint Provincial Election 

W.P No.28985 of 2024 
 
3
Commissioner at Lahore regarding appointment of Election 
Tribunals in addition of the two Election Tribunals 
appointed vide notification dated 20.02.2024.  Six Judges of 
Lahore High Court were nominated by the Chief Justice for 
their appointment as Election Tribunals.  The areas of their 
jurisdiction were also mentioned in this letter regarding 
disposal of election petitions at the Principal Seat and 
Benches.  ECP did not act on the letter of 4.4.2024 until 
26.04.2024 when it proceeded to appoint two further 
Election Tribunals out of the six names in the letter of 
4.4.2024.  In the Notification of 26.04.2024 the territorial 
jurisdiction of the Election Tribunals so appointed was also 
determined by ECP.  On the same date, that is, 26.04.2024 
ECP addressed a letter to the Registrar Lahore High Court 
intimating regarding Notification of the Judges to act as 
Election Tribunals.  Apart from varying the territorial 
jurisdiction assigned to these Judges from the one which 
was proposed by the Chief Justice (as also notified on 
07.03.2024 by LHC), ECP made further request to the Chief 
Justice to “provide panel of honourable sitting Judges to 
the 
Election 
Commission 
of 
Pakistan 
for 
their 
appointment as Election Tribunals for the trial and 
disposal of election petitions pertaining to National/ 
Provincial Assemblies’ Constituencies of the Rawalpindi 
and Bahawalpur Divisions”.   Thus, ECP not only declined 
to nominate the names recommended by Chief Justice in full 
but also unilaterally changed their territorial jurisdiction 
regarding trial and disposal of election petitions.  Therefore, 
only two Judges out of the six nominated by the Chief 

W.P No.28985 of 2024 
 
4
Justice Lahore High Court were notified as Election 
Tribunals by ECP.  Simultaneously, a request was made for 
a panel of sitting Judges of Lahore High Court to be 
provided to ECP for their appointment as Election 
Tribunals.  This aspect of the matter was one of the main 
planks of challenge by the learned counsel for the 
petitioners. 
5. 
The letter of 26.04.2024 was responded to by Registrar 
Lahore High Court and the following observations are set 
out below: 
“…Moreover, as per our record, no such precedent is found 
where Election Commission of Pakistan demanded such 
‘panel’ in the past and the same was provided by this Court.  
You are therefore, required to provide any past practice/ 
precedent whereby in General Elections or Bye-Elections, 
any such ‘panel’ was specifically required and also insisted 
upon by the Election Commission of Pakistan and the same 
was provided by this Court.  Your response in this regard is 
required within two days positively to avoid any further 
unnecessary delay in this matter.” 
6. 
In a nub, the Registrar who without a shadow of doubt 
acted on behalf of the Chief Justice Lahore High Court, 
stated that no criteria had been mentioned in the Notification 
of 26.04.2024 on the basis of which two Judges out of the 
six Judges of the Court had been appointed as Election 
Tribunals.  It was made clear that there was no lawful basis 
for a panel of Judges to be provided to ECP for appointment 
as Election Tribunals.  Lastly, a reference was made to the 
large number of election petitions which were required to be 
decided and that the number of Election Tribunals did not 
commensurate with the number of election matters which 
were brought before Lahore High Court.  This letter was 
replied on 6.5.2024 containing ECP’s counterveiling 
argument regarding provision of a panel of sitting Judges to 

W.P No.28985 of 2024 
 
5
be a sine qua non for the process of meaningful consultation 
to take place.  While this correspondence was being 
exchanged between ECP and Lahore High Court, on 
09.05.2024 the following Notification was issued: 
“In continuation of this Commission’s earlier notification of 
even number dated 26th April 2024 and in pursuance of the 
provisions of Section 140 of the Elections Act, 2017, the 
Election Commission of Pakistan has been pleased to 
further notify that the Election Petitions pertaining to the 
National/ 
Provincial 
Assembly 
Constituencies 
of 
Rawalpindi and Bahawalpur Divisions, shall be tried and 
heard by the already notified Election Tribunals, at Lahore 
and Multan respectively, as were notified vide notification 
No.20 T & Coord. Dated 07-03-2024 of Lahore High Court, 
Lahore. i.e Election Petitions pertaining to the constituency 
of Rawalpindi division to Mr. Justice Sultan Tanveer 
Ahmad and Election Petitions of the constituencies of 
Multan and Bahawalpur divisions to Mr. Justice Sardar 
Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar, in addition to their already 
assigned areas, with immediate effect and till further orders 
by the Commission.” 
7. 
The Notification set out above assigned the election 
petitions relating to National/ Provincial Assemblies’ 
constituencies of Rawalpindi and Bahawalpur Divisions to 
be tried and heard by the already notified Election Tribunals 
on 7.3.2024.  Once again, a letter was written to the 
Secretary ECP by the Registrar Lahore High Court rebutting 
the stated position of ECP regarding a panel of Judges to be 
provided and questioned the observations that such a panel 
was recommended in the past for ECP to consider and 
appoint Election Tribunals at its whim and choice.  Further 
response was given on 16.05.2024 by ECP. 
8. 
It can be culled out from the narration of facts brought 
forth above that ECP and the Hon’ble Chief Justice Lahore 
High Court have been engaged in a consultative process and 
it is common ground between the parties that consultation 
has been taking place between the two and it cannot be 

W.P No.28985 of 2024 
 
6
contended that the process of consultation has been absent in 
the entire process of appointment of Election Tribunals.  
Thus, the issue relating to consultation or lack of it would 
not exercise any gravitational pull and the only question that 
now remains to be decided by this Court is whether the 
consultation should be construed in such a manner that 
paramountcy is given to the nominations made by the Chief 
Justice.  This further begs the question whether ECP has the 
discretion in the matter to take a stance contrary to the 
nominations made by the Chief Justice and not only appoint 
Judges of its own choosing as Election Tribunals as also 
proceed to assign them areas of jurisdiction within which 
they shall try and decide election petitions. 
9. 
Learned counsel for ECP raised three threshold 
objections which will be dealt with at the outset. 
10. The first relates to the hearing of these petitions by this 
Bench as one of the names nominated by the Chief Justice as 
Election Tribunals comprised this Bench as well.  This 
objection should receive a short shrift.  The issue engaged in 
these petitions is a matter of public importance and does not 
relate to my private matters nor do I derive any personal 
benefits so as to attract the doctrine of recusal and bias.  At 
best, the Chief Justice may choose to withdraw my name as 
the nominated Election Tribunal on the ground that I have 
heard these petitions.  Further any of the parties to this 
litigation may raise their objections to the hearing of election 
petitions if these are fixed before the Election Tribunal 
comprising this Bench and if at all such a situation arises.  In 

W.P No.28985 of 2024 
 
7
any case, the learned counsel to his credit made a flanking 
rather than a frontal attack on the basis of this objection. 
11. The second objection relates to the standing of one of 
the petitioners Mr. Salman Akram Raja to file and maintain 
his petition as an Election Tribunal has already been 
nominated and notified for the adjudication of election 
petitions at the principal seat.  There is no contention that 
the said petitioner does not have a right to the hearing of his 
election petition by a particular Election Tribunal and this 
would be within the discretion of the Hon’ble Chief Justice 
in accordance with the areas assigned to different Election 
Tribunals.   
12. The third objection relates to passing of an order under 
Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 (“the Constitution”) in respect of the acts of 
the High Court which are judicial or administrative in 
nature.  This was argued on the basis of a judgment of the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan reported as Gul Taiz Khan 
Marwat v. The Registrar, Peshawar High Court (PLD 2021 
Supreme Court 391) which prohibits the filing of a 
constitutional petition in respect of actions taken by a High 
Court whether in its judicial or administrative capacity and it 
was laid down that no directions under Article 199 of the 
Constitution could be issued to a Judge of the High Court in 
both capacities.  There can be no dispute regarding the 
holding of the Supreme Court in the case referred by learned 
counsel for ECP but the precedent has no relevance to the 
facts of present cases.  Here, the Court is engaged in the 
construction of section 140 of the Act and the refusal of ECP 

W.P No.28985 of 2024 
 
8
to act upon the nominations made by the Hon’ble Chief 
Justice Lahore High Court.  These are two materially 
distinct propositions and one cannot be confused with the 
other.  In essence, the actions of ECP are under challenge 
and upon which this Court will render its ruling.  ECP is a 
person performing functions in connection with the affairs 
of the Federation and so is caught by the jurisdiction of this 
Court. 
13. Learned counsel for the petitioners based his arguments 
on the concepts of independence of judiciary and the 
absence of any requirement in law as well as the 
Constitution for a panel of Judges to be sent to ECP for their 
appointment as Election Tribunals. 
14. Section 140 of the Act provides that: 
“140. Appointment of Election Tribunals.— (1) For the 
trial of election petitions under this Act, the Commission 
shall appoint as many Election Tribunals as may be 
necessary for swift disposal of election petitions. 
(2) An Election Tribunal shall comprise— 
(a) in the case of an election to an Assembly or the Senate, 
a person who is or has been a Judge of a High Court; and 
(b) in the case of an election to a local government, a 
District and Sessions Judge or an Additional District and 
Sessions Judge. 
(3) The Commission shall appoint a sitting judge as 
Election Tribunal in consultation with the Chief Justice of 
the High Court concerned.” 
15. Section 140 requires unpacking in order to arrive at the 
true construction to be given to this provision and in 
particular sub-section (3).  The appointment of Election 
Tribunals is a power conferred upon ECP by section 140 and 
there is no cavil with this argument.  The arguments in this 
Court on behalf of ECP centered on the word “appoint” 

W.P No.28985 of 2024 
 
9
from which it was sought to be deduced by the learned 
counsel that the entire discretion to appoint an Election 
Tribunal would vest in ECP to the exclusion of all others 
and this must be read as conferring primacy in the matter on 
the acts of ECP and thus the Chief Justice Lahore High 
Court has misconstrued that the nominations so made must 
be notified and appointed.  This argument is remarkably 
cramped and would have the effect of nullifying the effect of 
sub-section (3) of section 140 of the Act.  In order to render 
a harmonious interpretation the entire section 140 will have 
to be read holistically. 
16. In my opinion, sub-section (3) refers to a stage prior to 
appointment of Election Tribunals by ECP and that stage 
contemplates the appointment of a sitting Judge as Election 
Tribunal in consultation with the Chief Justice of the High 
Court concerned.  Therefore, the consultative process has to 
precede the appointment to be made by ECP.  This brings us 
to the next question as to what precisely is meant by 
consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court 
concerned. 
17. The word “consultation” has received judicial 
interpretation in the seminal case of Al-Jehad Trust through 
Raeesul Mujahideen Habib-ul-Wahab-ul-Khairi and others 
v. Federation of Pakistan and others (PLD 1996 Supreme 
Court 324).  It is presumed that the Parliament was aware of 
the interpretation put on the word ‘consultation’ by the 
superior courts and in particular by the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in Al-Jehad Trust.  By now, the term ‘consultation’ 
has morphed into a term of art and use of this term has a 

W.P No.28985 of 2024 
 
10
definite and precise meaning which has to be attributed to it 
in the context of Al-Jehad Trust case. Not only that the 
Parliament is presumed to be aware of it but also ECP must 
have a fair idea of what is meant by the Parliament when it 
uses the term ‘consultation’ in any statutory instrument.  
This is also a canon of construction vouched by authority. 
18. This canon of interpretation has been described as 
prior-construction canon in Reading Law: The Interpretation 
of Legal Texts by Antonin Scalia and Bryan A. Garner.  It 
states the rule as follows: 
“If a statute uses words or phrases that have already 
received authoritative construction by the jurisdiction’s 
court of last resort, or even uniform construction by inferior 
courts or a responsible administrative agency, they are to 
be understood according to that construction.” 
 
While stating the rule, the treatise relied upon Shapiro 
v. United States 335 U.S. 1, 16 (1948) (per Vinson, C.J) 
which held that: 
“In adopting the language used in the earlier act, Congress 
must be considered to have adopted also the construction 
given by this Court to such language, and made it a part of 
the enactment.” 
 
In England, the prior-construction canon is called “the 
rule of Ex-parte Campbell” after an 1870 case [1870] L.R. 5 
Ch. App. 703. in which Lord Justice James declared: 
“Where once certain words in an Act of Parliament have 
received a judicial construction in one of the Superior 
Courts, and the Legislature has repeated them without any 
alteration in a subsequent statute, I conceive that the 
Legislature must be taken to have used them according to 
the meaning which a Court of competent jurisdiction has 
given to them.” 
 
This rule has been relied upon by our courts, too. 
19. In Al-Jehad Trust, the following question was 
formulated: 

W.P No.28985 of 2024 
 
11
“For the present the most important and pivotal question 
for consideration is the concept of "consultation" provided 
in the Constitution for the appointment of the Judges as 
mentioned in the Articles 177 and 193 thereof. More 
thought? provoking question is whether the "consultation" 
envisaged in the Constitution in respect of appointment of 
the Judges is institutionalised, participatory and binding or 
mere a formality. 
 
20. By way of historical facts, it may be stated that Articles 
177 and 193 of the Constitution, were materially different 
prior to the amendments made through the Constitution 
(Eighteenth Amendment) Act, 2010.  Priorly, the President 
appointed the Judges to the superior courts in consultation 
with the Chief Justice of Pakistan and the Governor of the 
Province.  The issue fell for determination before the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in Al-Jehad Trust as to whether 
there was in fact consultation between the President and the 
consultees and also what was the status of consultation and 
the views in consequence thereof of the Chief Justice of 
Pakistan with regard to the question of appointment.  After 
framing the question set out above the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan went on to deal with the issue by stating that: 
“"Consultation" in the scheme as envisaged in the 
Constitution is supposed to be effective, meaningful, 
purposive, consensus-ori6nted, leaving no room for 
complaint of arbitrariness ' or unfair play. The opinion of 
the Chief Justice of Pakistan and Chief Justice of a High 
Court as to the fitness and suitability of a candidate for 
judgeship?? is entitled to be accepted in the absence of very 
sound reasons to be recorded in writing by the 
President/Executive. 
 
81. If the Chief Justice of the High Court and the Chief 
Justice of Pakistan are of the opinion that a particular 
candidate is not fit and capable to be appointed as Judge of 
the High Court, then acting against the expert opinion 
would not be proper exercise of power to appoint him as a 
Judge on the ground that the President/Executive has final 
say in the matter. It is not correct interpretation to say that 
because word "consultation" is used, which is different from 
',consent', opinion of Chief Justice can be ignored... 
82. We are interpreting the word 'consultation' to widen 
and enlarge its normal scope for the reasons, firstly, that 

W.P No.28985 of 2024 
 
12
the Constitution-makers have not debated this word 
'consultation' and fixed its parameters. Secondly, we would 
like to assign meaning to 'consultation', which is consistent 
and commensurate with the exalted position of Judiciary as 
is envisaged in Islam. Thirdly, we would like to give positive 
interpretation 
to 
'consultation' 
which 
promotes 
independence of Judiciary. Executive may have the last 
word and may issue notification of appointment, but cannot 
give loose interpretation to the word I consultation' to 
ignore or brush aside expert opinion of Chief Justice of the 
High Court and the Chief Justice of Pakistan. Fourthly, the 
President is administered oath by the Chief Justice of 
Pakistan as required under Article 42 of the. Constitution 
and the Chief Justice of Pakistan administers oath to other 
Judges of the Supreme Court and Chief Justice of Province 
administers oath to Judges of his High Court as 
contemplated under Articles 178 and 194 respectively, 
which shows that both the Chief Justices are tends of their 
institutions and their opinion in their own field of expertise 
should not be treated lightly particularly when they are 
Constitutional consultees and the appointments are also 
being made of the Judges within the Constitutional scheme. 
 
21. It was held that the consultation has to be effective, 
meaningful and purposive.  More importantly, the Supreme 
Court clearly stated that the opinion of the Chief Justice of 
Pakistan and the Chief Justice of a High Court as to the 
fitness and suitability of a candidate for being appointed as a 
Judge was entitled to be accepted in the absence of very 
sound reasons to be recorded in writing by the 
President/Executive.  Moreover, the opinion of the Chief 
Justice could not be ignored and this was evident from the 
use of the word “consultation”.  This was held 
notwithstanding the fact that the power to appoint vested in 
the President and this aspect on which much emphasis was 
laid by learned counsel for ECP was squarely dealt with in 
Al-Jehad Trust while holding that though the Executive may 
have the last word and may issue Notification of 
appointment, but this had to give way to the interpretation 
regarding the word ‘consultation’ put by the Supreme Court 
and cannot ignore the opinion of the Chief Justice of 

W.P No.28985 of 2024 
 
13
Pakistan or the High Court as the case may be.  In 
conclusion, it was held that: 
“(i) The words "after consultation" employed inter alia in 
Articles 177 and 193 of the Constitution connote that the 
consultation should be? effective, meaningful, purposive, 
consensus oriented, leaving no room for complaint of 
arbitrariness or unfair play. The opinion of the Chief 
Justice of Pakistan and the Chief Justice of a High Court as 
to-the fitness and suitability of a candidate for judgeship is 
entitled to be accepted in the absence of very sound reasons 
to be recorded by the President/Executive. 
 
(ii) 
That if the President/Executive appoints a candidate 
found to be unfit and unsuitable for judgeship by the Chief 
Justice of Pakistan and the Chief Justice of the High Court 
concerned, it will not be a proper exercise of power under 
the relevant Article of the Constitution. 
 
(xiii)That 
since 
consultation 
for 
the 
appointment/confirmation of a Judge of a Superior Court by 
the President/Executive with consultees mentioned in the 
relevant Articles of the Constitution is mandatory any 
appointment/confirmation made without consulting any of 
the consultees as interpreted above would be violative of the 
Constitution and, therefore, would be invalid. 
 
22. Ajmal Mian, J. also alluded to the undisputed position 
that act of appointing of a Chief Justice or a Judge in the 
superior courts is an executive act.  But went on to agree 
with the conclusions drawn by the Chief Justice in Al-Jehad 
Trust that the views of the Chief Justice of the High Court 
concerned and the Chief Justice of Pakistan cannot be 
rejected for extraneous considerations and if the executive 
wished to disagree it had to record strong reasons which will 
be justiciable.  Further another crucial aspect was flagged.  It 
was that if the Chief Justice of the High Court concerned 
and the Chief Justice of Pakistan did not find a person fit to 
be appointed as a Judge of a High Court that person cannot 
be appointed as it will not be a proper exercise of power to 
appoint under the Articles of the Constitution. 

W.P No.28985 of 2024 
 
14
23. Learned counsel for ECP contended that this case was 
in the paradigm of appointment of Judges to the superior 
courts.  This is an erroneous view of Al-Jehad Trust and the 
interpretation put on the word ‘consultation’ was intended to 
apply in all matters where the word was used in all future 
statutory instruments.  Such a contention would offend the 
intention of the legislature as well while enacting sub-
section (3) of section 140 of the Act while using the word 
‘consultation’ which has become a well-worn term over the 
years since its exposition in Al-Jehad Trust.  Likewise, 
ECP’s view on the issue is a misdirection of law which 
feeds through the rest of the decision-making process. 
24. We now advert to Sh. Ria ul Haq and another v. 
Federation of Pakistan through Ministry of Law and others 
(PLD 2013 Supreme Court 501) in which the Supreme 
Court not only reaffirmed the rule but was more emphatic in 
its application. It said that: 
“58. 
On having discussed the cases supra it is concluded 
that Service Tribunals (Federal and Provincial) falling in 
the category of Court capable to exercise judicial powers 
are bound to follow the principle of independence judiciary 
for the purpose of ensuring  enforcement of fundamental 
rights of access to justice under Article 9 of the 
Constitution, thus, are required to be separated from the 
Executive under Article 175(3) of the Constitution. These 
listed constitutional objects ought to have been redressed by 
the Legislature in making suitable amendments in the law 
governing the Tribunals and the rules framed thereunder to 
the extent as noted hereinabove, any of the provisions of the 
law contrary to the fundamental and constitutional 
provisions if any. 
 
59. 
To make the Chairman and the Members of the 
Service Tribunal independent, it is necessary to make their 
appointment with the meaningful consultation of the Chief 
Justice i.e. for the purpose of Federal Service Tribunal, 
with the Chief Justice of Pakistan and for Provincial 
Service Tribunals, with the Chief Justice of the respective 
High Court. It is to be noted that compliance of such 
condition seems to be necessary, because if the Chairman 
has to be appointed amongst the sitting Judges of a High 
Court, without consent of the Chief Justice, judicially and 

W.P No.28985 of 2024 
 
15
administratively, no Judge of the High Court can relinquish 
the post of Judge of High Court without the approval of the 
concerned Chief Justice as he has to discharge his function 
as a Judge of High Court under the administrative control 
of the Chief Justice. Similarly, a person qualified to be the 
Judge of High Court, either a District Judge or an 
advocate, has to be appointed with the meaningful 
consultation of the Chief Justice of the High Court because 
the District Judge, if is allowed to hold the charge of 
Provincial Service Tribunal, can only be released, if 
permission is granted by the Chief Justice. As far as the 
appointment  of an advocate who is qualified to be the 
Chairman of a Tribunal or the Member is concerned, his 
performance  or capability can only be evaluated during the 
period when he had been practicing law because a person 
who had obtained enrollment but had never appeared 
before the High Court or Supreme Court cannot claim to 
have legal experience. 
 
60. 
As far as a sitting Judge of the High Court acting as 
Chairman of the tribunal is concerned, there is no difficulty 
in determining the tenure during which he shall hold the 
charge in addition to his own functions, simultaneously 
performing as a Judge of the High Court and the Chairman 
of the Tribunal. Preferably, it would be appropriate and in 
the interest of institution if a sitting Judge is not asked to 
perform his duties as Chairman of a Federal or Provincial 
Service Tribunals. However, appointments for the position 
of Chairman can conveniently be made from amongst the 
Judges who had been a Judge of the High Court. If a retired 
Judge of the High Court is to be appointed as Chairman of 
the Tribunal, selection should be made in consultation with 
the Chief Justice of the High Court in the case of a 
Provincial Service Tribunal and in consultation with the 
Chief Justice of Pakistan in the case of Federal Service 
Tribunal, who may nominate a retired Judge... “ 
Therefore, the Executive cannot be allowed to interfere in 
the process of appointment of such important functionaries 
of Tribunals i.e. Chairman, who is required to be appointed 
independently because while discharging its functions the 
tribunal does not act as an executive body rather performs 
judicial functions. If such a body/tribunal is not in a 
position to enforce Fundamental Rights, including the right 
to have access to justice because of the reason that when 
the appointments have to be made, they remain at the mercy 
of the executive, which is itself a litigant party in most of the 
cases before the Tribunal, and no hope can be pinned on 
such a tribunal to discharge its functions independently.” 
25. Firstly, such Tribunals were held as courts exercising 
judicial functions.  Secondly, the consultation with Chief 
Justice and its binding nature was tied in with the 
fundamental right of access to justice.  Thirdly, sound 
reasons were given for conferring primacy to the Chief 

W.P No.28985 of 2024 
 
16
Justice’s word.  This precedent settles the cardinal feature of 
independence of judiciary in all such matters. 
26. We will now apply the exposition of the word 
‘consultation’ made in Al-Jehad Trust to the facts of the 
present petitions.  There is a cluster of missive referred to 
above (and regarding which the parties are on common 
ground).  It is evident that ECP and Chief Justice Lahore 
High Court engaged in a meaningful consultation which had 
a purpose.  But the fact remains that the Chief Justice 
Lahore High Court through the Registrar was categoric in 
assertion of the primacy attached to the nominations made 
by Chief Justice of a High Court in such matters. 
27. At the time of appointment of the Election Tribunals 
initially on 20.02.2024 no further correspondence was 
exchanged with the LHC for appointment of more Election 
Tribunals and the two Honourable Judges who were 
recommended for being appointed were so appointed as 
Election Tribunals by ECP.  This is despite the fact that on 
15.02.2024 a letter had been written by ECP to the Chief 
Justice Lahore High Court for nomination of nine sitting 
Judges for their appointment as Election Tribunals.  ECP sat 
in a state of inertia in the matter until the letter of 4.4.2024 
written by the Registrar to ECP nominating six more Judges 
to be appointed as Election Tribunals.  It is evident from the 
letter of 4.4.2024 that it was merely nominating more Judges 
on the request made earlier by ECP on 15.02.2024.  Once 
again, ECP did not act promptly and a Notification was 
issued on 26.04.2024.  Through this Notification, ECP 
without any rhyme or reason, selected two Judges from the 

W.P No.28985 of 2024 
 
17
six nominated by Lahore High Court and assigned them 
their areas of jurisdiction as well.  Thus, ECP not only chose 
to ignore the nominations made by Lahore High Court but 
also conferred jurisdiction upon the Election Tribunals.  This 
was in sharp contrast to the Notification earlier issued on 
7.3.2024 by the Registrar Lahore High Court whereby 
Lahore High Court had assigned areas to the Election 
Tribunals for the trial and disposal of election petitions.  
Once ECP had accepted the power of Lahore High Court to 
assign areas to Election Tribunals in the case of the 
Notification dated 7.3.2024, it was unreasonable and 
irrational on the part of ECP to have usurped that power and 
confer it upon itself to assign the areas within which the 
Election Tribunals shall perform their duties.  Further a 
letter was addressed on 26.04.2024 which required the Chief 
Justice Lahore High Court to provide a panel of Judges for 
their appointment as Election Tribunals.  Since a stalemate 
had admittedly set in the consultation process, ECP took 
upon itself and assumed the power to assign areas to 
Election Tribunals while insisting upon a panel of Judges to 
be provided for their appointment as Election Tribunals.  
This puts paid to the argument of ECP that consultation is 
ongoing.  In fact the parties have arrived at an impasse.  The 
act of ECP in insisting upon a panel of Judges to be 
provided not only does not have a legal basis but also creates 
an unsavory situation.  As the statutory wording makes 
clear, the only condition that the law prescribes is for 
consultation to be held and not that ECP can assume a 
dominant position to claim preeminence in the matter.  It 

W.P No.28985 of 2024 
 
18
does not empower ECP to carve out procedures of its own 
choosing.  This cannot be permitted to be read in section 
140(3) and such a wide margin of judgment cannot be 
afforded to ECP.  There is no reasonable and intelligible 
criteria on the basis of which ECP has selected two Judges 
out of six nominated by the Chief Justice and has refused to 
nominate the other four Judges as Election Tribunals.  This 
would have been permissible had ECP conveyed its 
intention to appoint lesser Election Tribunals than the nine 
initially recommended for appointment and it had been 
conveyed to the Registrar Lahore High Court that this would 
constitute sufficient numbers to deal with and decide 
election petitions.  On the contrary, ECP while appointing 
two Judges out of six nominated by the Chief Justice, went 
on to insist that a panel of Judges be provided for their 
appointment as Election Tribunals for the trial and 
disposal of the election petitions pertaining to National/ 
Provincial Assemblies constituencies of Rawalpindi and 
Bahawalpur Divisions.  The clear implication was that four 
other Judges nominated by the Hon’ble Chief Justice did not 
find favour with ECP for reasons best known to ECP and so 
the insistence on a further panel of Honourable Judges from 
which ECP could pick and choose for being appointed as 
Election Tribunals.  This is impermissible to ECP and 
cannot be countenanced.  We must bear in mind that we are 
concerned with sitting Judge of LHC and ECP is not tasked 
with determining their fitness and suitability (as in case of 
Al-Jehad Trust).  Thus ECP has no power at all to pick and 
choose Judges out of a panel which suits its cause.  This is 

W.P No.28985 of 2024 
 
19
not only offensive but strikes at the concept of judicial 
integrity and comity.  It is egregious and harmful to 
independence of judiciary and is an expression of lack of 
trust in the discretion exercised by the Hon’ble Chief 
Justice.  It needs to be clarified here that the position in Al-
Jehad Trust that requires reasons to be given in case of 
dissent by the executive does not apply here for the simple 
reason that ECP is not competent to proffer any comments 
on the integrity of a sitting Judge.  This is impermissible to 
ECP. 
28. At this juncture, the conduct of ECP comes into sharp 
focus.  In respect of other High Courts, ECP has 
demonstrated a deference to their judgment.  The dissent and 
insistence on extraneous considerations is peculiar to 
Punjab.  Cloaked in the layers of missive exchanged with 
LHC, an unmistakable partisan slant is palpable which does 
not comport with the purpose animating Article 218 of the 
Constitution. 
29. Learned counsel for ECP has drawn the attention of 
this Court to Articles 219 (c) and Article 222 (Proviso) of 
the Constitution).  These Articles provided that: 
219. The 1 [Commission] shall be charged with the duty of-
- 
(c) appointing Election Tribunals.  
(222) … 
“but no such law shall have the effect of taking away or 
abridging any of the powers of the Commissioner or the 
Election Commission under this Part. 
30. It was contended by learned counsel that no law can be 
made by the Parliament which will have the effect of taking 

W.P No.28985 of 2024 
 
20
away or abridging any of the powers of ECP.  This is sought 
to be read with Article 219(c) which gives power to ECP to 
appoint Election Tribunals.  There is no contention with the 
primary argument and the underlying purpose for which 
these two provisions have been provided in the Constitution.  
It is by now settled that appointment of Election Tribunals is 
conceded to ECP and one cannot mount a counter argument.  
But the appointment is again a power of the Executive and 
in many cases is a ministerial power and cannot be used to 
nullify the process which must precede the exercise of that 
power of appointment.  This was precisely the case in Al-
Jehad Trust and Riaz ul Haq where meaningful consultation 
was considered an essential condition of appointment and 
thereafter it was held that the President may appoint the 
nominations made as a result of consultation and in case 
there was a disagreement, the opinion of Chief Justice of 
Pakistan or the High Court concerned would have a binding 
effect.  Doubtless, the Chief Justice of Pakistan or the Chief 
Justice of the High Court concerned in the matter of 
appointment of Judges of the High Court cannot be 
attributed the power to appoint a Judge which is a 
ministerial act to be accomplished by the Executive after the 
entire process has culminated.  This is the construction to be 
put on the use of the word “appointing” in Article 219(c) of 
the Constitution.  This argument also raises the inference as 
if the learned counsel for ECP invites this Court to hold that 
mention of the word ‘consultation’ in sub-section (3) of 
section 140 should be rendered meaningless and nugatory 
and the decision of ECP will prevail under any 

W.P No.28985 of 2024 
 
21
circumstances.  This is a misconstruction of law and a 
fallacy which cannot be given credence.  This aspect of the 
matter as to what constitutes appointment has also been dealt 
with in Al-Jehad Trust and applies on all fours in the present 
cases.  For instance, see Article 193(1) which provides: 
“193(1) 
The Chief Justice and each of other Judges 
of a High Court shall be appointed by the President in 
accordance with Article 175A.” 
 
Thus, the Chief Justice and Judges are to be appointed 
by the President (who has no role in the process) in 
accordance with Article 175A.  Can it be argued by ECP 
that since the President appoints, so primacy must attach to 
the selection made by him? Clearly not.  Such an argument 
is untenable. 
31. The term ‘consultation’ is a widely used term both in 
the Constitution as well as various laws.  Article 235 of the 
Constitution requires that the President may impose a 
financial emergency after consultation with the Governors of 
the Provinces.  In the present Article 175A clause 5 (iv) 2nd 
proviso requires that Chief Justice of Pakistan shall 
nominate a former Chief Justice or a former Judge of that 
Court in consultation with four Member Judges.  Similarly, 
Article 182 authorizes the Chief Justice of Pakistan in 
consultation with the Judicial Commission for appointment 
of ad hoc Judges.  Thus, the term has a wide ranging 
presence and has been construed in Al-Jehad Trust in the 
context of appointment of Judges to superior courts which 
gave an edge to the opinion of the Chief Justice of Pakistan 
and the Chief Justice of the High Court concerned in view of 
the exalted position of the judiciary as envisaged in Islam as 

W.P No.28985 of 2024 
 
22
also in the light of several provisions of the Constitution 
which relate to the judiciary guaranteeing its independence.   
32. In an election petition it may well be that ECP is a 
party and many of its acts would be subjected to trial and 
decision by the Election Tribunals.  The purpose of enacting 
sub-section (3) of section 140 of the Act clearly seems to 
refer the matter regarding nomination of Judges to an 
independent arbiter, that is, Chief Justice of the High Court 
concerned and while the ECP may engage in consultation 
with the Chief Justice of the High Court regarding matters 
relating to the number of Election Tribunals to be appointed 
yet must defer to the opinion of the Chief Justice in the 
matter relating to nomination of Judges for being appointed 
as Election Tribunals.  This is not a power given to ECP 
under the law as it stands today.  The law now obliges the 
Election Tribunals to decide the election petitions within 
180 days.  If the election petition is not finally decided 
within 180 days (section 148 of the Act) then consequences 
have been provided one of which is stated in clause ‘d’ of 
sub-section (6) of section 148: 
“if a serving Judge is the Election Tribunal, the 
Commission shall request the Chief Justice of the High 
Court that no judicial work other than election petitions 
should, to the extent practicable, be entrusted to him till the 
final disposal of the election petitions.” 
33. The above provision confers a power on ECP to 
request the Chief Justice not to assign judicial work other 
than election petitions to a serving judge appointed as an 
Election Tribunal.  Thus, not only that ECP will request the 
nomination of Judges to be appointed as Election Tribunals 
but shall also make a request to the Chief Justice of the High 

W.P No.28985 of 2024 
 
23
Court if the election petitions are not being decided 
expeditiously and within the time frame provided by law.  In 
respect of assignment of words, the law itself provides 
dominance to the Chief Justice and merely a request can be 
made by ECP.  This aspect has a close nexus with the 
unilateral act of ECP to assign areas of jurisdiction to 
different Election Tribunals.  Plainly, the law does not 
permit the exercise of such power by ECP. 
34. The second issue which arises in these petitions relates 
to the power of ECP to assign area of jurisdiction to the 
Election Tribunals.  This purported power has absolutely no 
basis and ECP while issuing the Notifications has not relied 
upon any statutory provision in the Act under which ECP 
can assign areas of jurisdiction.  This is quintessentially a 
power vesting in the Chief Justice of a High Court and 
relates to his administrative powers of assigning cases to the 
Judges of that Court including settling the roster of hearing 
by the Judges.  This cannot be seized by a unilateral act and 
without any lawful basis.  Therefore, the act of ECP in 
assigning areas to Election Tribunals for the trial and 
disposal of election petitions is ultra vires and without 
lawful authority. 
35. Another factor which compels this Court to hold that 
the opinion of the Chief Justice must prevail is that, to use 
an oft-quoted term, he is the master of roster for the High 
Courts, under the current dispensation.  Judges are borrowed 
by ECP to act as Election Tribunals.  Though the Chief 
Justice is first amongst equals in judicial work, his range of 
administrative powers is vast and exclusive.  ECP cannot 

W.P No.28985 of 2024 
 
24
have the luxury of choice of Judges in a situation where 
LHC is inundated with cases with a huge backlog.  The 
Chief Justice is the best person suited to take a decision 
regarding which Judges to spare by taking into account 
various considerations and factors within his peculiar 
knowledge.  ECP cannot, by any stretch of imagination, 
insist on a particular Judge when the Chief Justice wants that 
Judge to clear a certain class of cases which he has the 
capacity to decide expeditiously.  It must be borne in mind 
that Judges of this Court do not merely exercise jurisdiction 
under the Act but do so under different Federal and 
Provincial laws for which the Chief Justice decides to assign 
work.  These are matters to which ECP has no access.  
Telling a chief Justice of a High Court to appoint this and 
that Judge as Election Tribunal is tantamount to usurpation 
of the administrative powers of a Chief Justice conferred by 
the Constitution and law.  This also impinges upon the right 
of access to justice enshrined in the Constitution.  Further, if 
this were conceded to ECP, it would mean that a Chief 
Justice will be required to act on the direction of ECP.  Such 
a result is unpalatable and unlawful.  Let us take a 
hypothetical example.  A situation may arise of a stalemate 
between ECP and a High Court in such a matter, and ECP 
appoints Election Tribunals at its discretion (as has been 
done in the instant case).  Notwithstanding the appointment, 
the Chief Justice of a High Court may direct the office not to 
assign election petitions to the appointed Election Tribunals.  
What will the ECP do? Nothing, in my opinion! ECP has no 
power over the office of a High Court and cannot direct it to 

W.P No.28985 of 2024 
 
25
perform functions contrary to the directions of a Chief 
Justice. Indubitably, therefore, when consultation is 
provided in law, all other authorities must surrender to the 
opinion of a Chief Justice as the functions of a Chief Justice 
invoke a complicated balancing of a number of factors. 
36. In view of the above, these petitions are allowed.  In 
conclusion, it is declared that: 
i. In matters of appointment of Election Tribunals under 
Section 140 of the Act, the opinion of a Chief Justice 
of a High Court shall have preeminence over a 
contrary view of ECP and ECP is bound to appoint 
Judges nominated by the Chief Justice. 
ii. The Notification of 26.04.2024 to the extent that it 
assigns areas of jurisdiction to Election Tribunals is 
set aside.  The territorial jurisdiction and areas to be 
assigned is the exclusive domain of the Chief Justice 
of a High Court.  The letter dated 26.04.2024 by ECP 
is also held to be unlawful being beyond the powers 
of ECP to require the Chief Justice of LHC to provide 
a panel of Judges to ECP for their appointment as 
Election Tribunals. 
iii. On the same analogy, the Notification of ECP dated 
09.05.2024 is also set aside. 
iv. ECP is under obligation to appoint as Election 
Tribunals all six Judges of this Court as nominated 
on 04.04.2024 by the Chief Justice unless the Chief 
Justice withdraws any name or seeks to substitute it.  
This shall be done and a Notification issued within 
the next one weak as the matter is of some urgency.  
In case ECP fails to do so, it shall be deemed to have 
been issued and the office of Lahore High Court shall 
proceed ahead on the dictum laid down and place the 
matters before the Hon’ble Chief Justice for

assigning areas to Election Tribunals including the 
six nominated on 04.04.2024.
