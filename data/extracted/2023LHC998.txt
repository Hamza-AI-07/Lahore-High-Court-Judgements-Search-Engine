Ch. Muhammad Iqbal, J:-  Through this single 
judgment, I intend to decide the titled Civil Revision as well as 
Civil Revision No.113/2014 as both these cases have arisen out 
of the same judgments & decrees.  
2.  
Through these civil revisions, the petitioners have 
challenged the validity of the judgment & decree dated 
24.09.2010 passed by the learned Civil Judge, Bhakkar who 
dismissed the suit for declaration and permanent injunction filed 
by the petitioners and also assailed the consolidated judgment & 
decree dated 26.09.2013 whereby the learned Additional District 
Judge, Bhakkar dismissed the appeals of the petitioners. 
3. 
Brief facts of the case are that the petitioners/plaintiffs 
filed a suit for declaration alongwith permanent injunction 
against the respondents/defendants and contended that land 
measuring 78000 Kanal bearing Khata Nos.96 to 634 situated in 
Moza Darboola Tehsil Mankera District Bhakkar is Shamlat Deh. 
Date of hearing  
:  30.01.2023                                        
Petitioners by     
:  Mr. Mubeen-ud-Din Qazi and Tahir Mahmood Chaudhary, Advocates 
Respondents by  
:  Mr. Muhammad Nawaz Chaudhary, Zubda-tul-Hussain and Muhammad 
Ahmad Qayyum, Advocates 

 
C.R.No.112/2014

That previously the suit land was bearing Khata Nos.1 to 41 
comprising of total land measuring 100200 Kanal out of which 
26000 
Kanal 
have 
become 
Adna 
Malkiat. 
The 
petitioners/plaintiffs and their predecessors are owners and 
residents of Moza Darboola. They have reclaimed the suit land on 
the basis of breaking up (نوتوڑ) as well as sinking of wells. The 
petitioners/plaintiffs have contended that they are the inferior 
proprietors (Adna Malkan) and are in possession of the suit land 
since 1923-24; that after promulgation of MLR No.64 the inferior 
proprietors (Adna Malkan) who were in possession of any 
Shamlate land, were declared as full owners of the said land. That 
by operation of above regulation, the petitioners who were 
inferior owners became full owners of the land. However, in this 
regard, they filed claim before the Collector, Bhakkar who vide 
order 29.05.1982 declared that the petitioners/plaintiffs are in 
possession of the suit land and accordingly mutation Nos.26 to 56 
were passed. The respondents/defendants being alleged superior 
owners [Aala Malkan] of the land challenged the said order 
through an appeal which was accepted by the Commissioner, 
Sargodha Division, Sargodha on 28.02.1983 and the order dated 
29.05.1982 was set aside. The petitioners assailed the order dated 
28.02.1983 before the Member, Board of Revenue through 
revision petitions which were accepted in the terms that the 
orders of the both the lower fora were set aside, the previous 
entries in the revenue record were maintained and the petitioners 
were advised to approach the Civil Court for redressal of their 
grievance. The petitioners/plaintiffs assailed the said orders 
through Writ Petitions [No.3034 & 3035 of 1986] which were 
dismissed by this Court on 27.07.1999.  
  
Thereafter, the petitioners/plaintiffs No.1 to 5 on their 
own as well as being representatives of petitioners/plaintiffs No.6 
to 1730 filed a suit. The respondents/defendants filed separate 

 
C.R.No.112/2014

contesting written statements. As per divergent pleadings of the 
respective parties following issues were framed:- 
1. Whether the plaintiffs are owner in possession of the suit land as 
Adna owners and the defendants have no concern whatsoever 
with the suit land? OPP 
2. Whether the order of Commissioner, Sargodha dated 
28.02.1983 is false illegal and liable to be cancelled? OPP. 
3. Whether the plaintiffs have got no cause of action? OPD. 
4. Whether the plaintiffs have not come to the court with clean 
hands? OPD. 
5. Whether the suit is barred by law of limitation ? OPD 
6. Whether this court has got no jurisdiction to entertain this suit? 
OPD 
7. Whether the suit is fictitious and based on concocted story and 
the plaintiffs are in illegal possession of the suit land therefore, 
the defendants are entitled to the recovery of Rs.1 Karor as 
special cost u/s 35-A of CPC? OPD. 
8. Whether the plaintiffs are estopped by their words and conduct 
to file this suit? OPD. 
9. Whether the defendants No.12 to 17 are entitled to the land 
mentioned in para 4 of preliminary objections on the basis of 
the decree therefore, the suit is liable to be dismissed? OPD-12 
to 17 
10. Whether Mst. Waziran widow of Khuda Bukhsh is necessary 
party, who has not been joined as party therefore, the suit is 
liable to be dismissed? OPD-12 to 17 
11. Whether the defendants Naheed Akhter & Muhammad Shakeel 
are minors who have been impleaded by next friend therefore 
the suit is liable to be dismissed? OPD-12 to 17 
12. Whether the suit is barred by principle of resjudicata? OPD-18 
to 27 & 31 to 49. 
13. Whether the suit is hit u/s 56-D of Specific Relief Act? OPD. 
14. Whether the description of the suit land is not correct, therefore, 
the suit is liable to be dismissed? OPD. 
15. Relief.  
The parties at discord led their respective pro and contra 
evidence. The learned trial court finally dismissed the suit of the 
petitioners/plaintiffs vide judgment & decree dated 24.09.2010. 
Being dejected, the petitioners/plaintiffs assailed the said 
judgment & decree through two separate appeals which were 
dismissed by the learned appellate Court through consolidated 
judgment & decree dated 26.09.2013. Hence, these civil 
revisions.

I have heard the arguments of learned counsels for the 
parties and have gone through the record with their able 
assistance. 
5. 
In order to prove the assertions made in the plaint as well 
as to prove issue No.1, plaintiffs produced Munir Hussain 
(P.W.1) who deposed that the plaintiffs are in possession of the 
suit land prior to 1923-1924; that the suit land is Shamlat and 
they are holding the land as inferior owner (adna maalik); that 
they installed tube-wells, planted trees and constructed houses on 
the suit land; that they used to pay Revenue fee (maalia) and 
other taxes etc.; that in 1958 Martial Law Regulation was 
promulgated and the Collector passed order declaring them as 
inferior owner (Adna Maalik) in the year 1982 and accordingly 
mutations were sanctioned; that against the said order the 
defendants filed an appeal which was accepted; that the 
petitioners filed petition before the Board of Revenue who 
advised them to approach Civil Court for redressal of the 
grievance; that they challenged the said order before the High Court 
but the order of Board of Revenue remained upheld. During cross 
examination, he deposed that:

6. 
Conversely, Tufail Ahmad, Patwari Moza Darbola has 
appeared as D.W.1, who deposed that the Moza Darbola is 
consisted of land measuring 16119 Kanal; that after promulgation 
of MLR 1966, 1972, 1977 the superior owners (aala malkan) of 
the Moza Darbola surrendered the land and land measuring 1474 
acre (117920 Kanal) was resumed in favour of the State by the 
Land Commission; that the cases of the Moza Darbola were 

 
C.R.No.112/2014 
 
6
pending in different Courts; that the District Collector, Bhakkar 
vide order dated 29.05.1982 passed order for the disbursement of 
land measuring 11952 Acre of Aala Malkan in favour of inferior 
owners (Adna Malkan) and in the year 2005-06 the rest of the 
area measuring 37098 Kanal was transferred in favour of 
Provincial Government through Land Commission; that the 
plaintiffs are illegal occupants due to which penalty (tawan) is 
required to be recovered from them. During cross examination, 
he stated that mutation No.24 dated 03.06.1982 was sanctioned in 
favour of defendants but the said mutation was cancelled by the 
order of Commissioner; that the said order was upheld by the 
Board of Revenue as well as High Court. Muhammad Afzal 
(D.W.2), one of the respondents/defendants has deposed that they 
purchased land measuring 635 Kanal 03 Marla from Madah 
Hussain s/o Bahadur and the plaintiffs have no concern with the 
said land.  
 
7. 
Admittedly, 
the 
suit 
land 
is 
Shamlat 
and 
the 
petitioners/plaintiffs & proforma respondents have claimed to be 
the inferior owner (adna maalikan) on the basis of breaking up 
(نوتوڑ) as well as sinking of wells but the rights of inferior 
ownership (adna malikan) were abolished, after the promulgation 
of MLR 1964. In Para 3 of Martial Law Regulation 1964, it is 
provided that any rule or order made therein, shall have effect 
notwithstanding anything contrary in any other law. For ready 
reference, Para 3 ibid is reproduced as under: 
 “3. Regulation to override other laws, etc. The provisions of the 
Regulation, any rule or order made thereunder, shall have affect 
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other law, or in any 
order or decree of Court or other authority, or in any rule or custom 
or usage, or in any contract, instrument, deed or other document.” 
 

 
C.R.No.112/2014 
 
7
Under Para 22 ibid, superior ownership (Aala Malkiat) and other 
similar interests stood abolished. For reference, Para 22 ibid is 
reproduced as under: 
“22. Intermediary interests. Ala-Milkiat and similar other interests 
subsisting immediately before the commencement of this 
Regulation, shall on such commencement, stand abolished and no 
compensation shall be claimed by, or paid, person affected by the 
abolition.” 
 
The petitioners/plaintiffs merely have claimed that they have 
broken up the land and have dug wells but in this regard they 
have not produced any evidence. Further, they also did not 
produce any evidence that the superior owners (aala maalikan) 
gave permission to the petitioners/plaintiffs for taking possession 
of the land. It is an essential pre-requisite for the inferior 
ownership (adna maalikan) that they shall approach the superior 
owners (aala maalikan) and offer them share of produce 
(nazrana / jhaar) and take permission but there is no favourable 
evidence in this regard. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan 
in a judgment titled as Khanan and 2 others Vs. Fateh Sher 
through Ahmad and 15 others (1993 SCMR 1578) has held that 
inferior owners (adna maalikan) should approach superior 
owners (aala maalikan) and offer them share of produce 
(nazrana / jhaar) and take permission and if such permission is 
granted, they (adna maalikan) could remain in possession. The 
petitioners/plaintiffs failed to prove the pre-requisite of inferior 
ownership (adna maalikeat) through any credible evidence. The 
petitioners/ plaintiffs have not fulfilled the criteria prior to the 
promulgation of MLR 1964. 
8. 
The Sindh Sagar Doab Colonization Act 1902 was 
repealed in 1929 and in the intervening period whereof, no 
proprietary rights of Shamlat were land granting in favour of any 
person. Munir Hussain (P.W.1) stated that they installed wells at 
the suit land but in this regard no solid, credible & corroboratory 

 
C.R.No.112/2014 
 
8
oral or documentary evidence was produced. As per the revenue 
record from 1943-1944 to 2005-2006, the nature of the suit land 
has been mentioned as barani, banjar qadeem and banjar jaded 
which proves that the suit land was never cultivated by the 
petitioners/plaintiffs nor they did any labour for the purpose of 
breaking up of the land to make it cultivable. This fact is 
mentioned in wajib-ul-arz of Moza Darbola (Exh.P.12). In a 
judgment cited as Ghulam Haider Vs. Ghulam Raza Shah and 12 
others (PLD 1979 Lahore 481) it has been held that no person 
can claim right of inferior ownership (adna malkiyat) by breaking 
barren (barani) land. Further, mere the cultivation is not a sole 
criterion / reason to confer proprietary rights on the basis of entry in 
the column No.6 of Jamabandi as “قبضہ باشرع مالکان بوجہ نو توڑ” as it 
neither creates any right of ownership in favour of the petitioners/ 
plaintiffs nor declares them as inferior owner (adna maalikan).  
9. 
As regard the claim of the petitioners/plaintiffs that they 
are in possession of the suit land since their forefathers for a long 
long time ago, as such they become owners of the land on the 
basis of adverse possession as well; suffice it to say in this regard 
that the Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in a landmark 
judgment reported as Maqbool Ahmed Vs. Government of 
Pakistan (1991 SCMR 2063), has already declared Section 28 of 
the Limitation Act, 1908 against the injunctions of Islam by 
holding that claim of adverse possession is repugnant to the 
injunctions of Islam. Thus, the above assertion of the petitioner/ 
plaintiff is devoid of any force. 
10.  
As regard the issue No.12 is concerned it is worth 
mentioning that as per available record, a lis having the same 
cause regarding the suit land among the same parties was earlier 
dismissed by the learned Civil Judge vide judgment & decree 
dated 13.11.1967 and appeal whereof was also dismissed by the 

 
C.R.No.112/2014 
 
9
learned District Judge, Mianwali on 13.05.1968. For reference, 
the operative portion of the judgment dated 13.05.1968 and the 
claim made by the petitioners/plaintiffs in the instant suit are 
reproduced as under:  
“Ali Muhammad and three others instituted the suit in the 
representative capacity under Order 1 rule 8 C.P.C., against 
Shamsher and 45 others, including the Land Commission and others 
entered in list „B‟ attached with the plaint for perpetual injunction 
seeking to restrain the defendants form making alterations or change 
by way of mutation or by any other means of ownership rights in 
respect of land measuring 156572 kanals 1 marla, situated in the 
area of village Darbula, Tehsil Bhakkar, as entered in the Jamabandi 
of the year 1963-64 and described in the heading of the plaint in 
detail. The plaintiffs also prayed for restraining the defendants from 
removing the entry of Shamilat-deh as incorporated in column No.5 
of the said Jamabandi. The plaintiffs claimed that they and their 
forefathers alongwith those entered in list „Alif‟ were in cultivating 
possession of the suit land since time immemorial. The first regular 
Settlement had taken place in the year 1878 and according to the 
terms of Wajib-ul-arz prepared in that Settlement the person who 
had brought the barren land under cultivation were considered as 
malikan Adna while the owners of the land were termed as Malikan 
Ala. In order to get the rights of Adna Malkiyat the plaintiffs and 
their fore-fathers had complied with the conditions necessary for it 
as laid down in the said Wajib-ul-arz.” 
 
After having lost the cause up to this Court, the petitioners/ 
plaintiffs again instituted the instant suit, wherein they have 
sought a similar declaration which is as under:  
"

As per record, in the earlier round of litigation, the Regular 
Second Appeal [No.586/1968] filed by the petitioners/plaintiffs 
was dismissed on 10.03.2000. The petitioners/plaintiffs did not 
challenge the aforesaid judgments & decrees any further, as such 
same have attained the status of finality and have become past 
and closed transaction. Reliance is placed on Pakistan 

 
C.R.No.112/2014 
 
10
International Airlines Corporation Vs. Aziz ur Rehman 
Chaudhary and another (2016 SCMR 14). The earlier lis of the 
same suit land among the same parties had already been decided 
upto this Court, as such the subsequent suit on the same issue or 
cause of action is not maintainable under Section 11 of CPC, 
which provision envisages that no Court shall try a suit or issue in 
which the matter directly or substantially in issue has already 
been decided in former suit between the same parties or between 
the parties under whom they or anyone of them remained 
litigating against same title which issue has earlier been raised 
and has finally been heard and decided by Court of competent 
jurisdiction. For ready reference, Section 11 C.P.C is reproduced 
as under: 
 
“Res Judicata. No Court shall try any suit or issue in which 
the matter directly and substantially in issue has been directly and 
substantially in issue in a former suit between the same parties, or 
between parties under whom they or any of them claim, litigating 
under the same title, in a Court competent to try such subsequent 
suit or the suit in which such issue has been subsequently raised, 
and has been heard and finally decided by such Court. 
  
Explanation I.__The expression "former suit" shall denote a 
suit which has been decided prior to the suit in question whether or 
not it was instituted prior thereto. 
 
Explanation II.__For the purposes of this section, the 
competence of a Court shall be determined irrespective of any 
provisions as to right of appeal from the decision of such Court. 
 
Explanation III.__The matter above referred to must in the 
former suit have been alleged by one party and either denied or 
admitted, expressly or impliedly, by the other. 
 
Explanation IV.__ Any matter which might and ought to have 
been made ground of defence or attack in such former suit shall be 
deemed to have been a matter directly and substantially in issue in 
such suit. 
 
Explanation V.__ Any relief claimed in the plaint, which is 
not expressly granted by the decree, shall, for the purposes of this 
section, be deemed to have been refused. 
 
Explanation VI.__ Where persons litigate bona fide in respect 
of a public right or of a private right claimed in common for 
themselves and others, all persons interested in such right shall, for 
the purposes of this section, be deemed to claim under the persons 
so litigating.”  

 
C.R.No.112/2014

The object of the principle of res-judicata is to make end of the lis 
and also to prevent multiplicity of litigation. That once a matter is 
decided finally between the parties to suit or proceedings then 
none from the said litigating parties could be allowed to re-agitate 
the matter in a subsequent suit or proceedings. The Hon‟ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case titled as Muhammad 
Chiragh-ud-Din Bhatti Vs The Province of West Pakistan (Now 
Province of Punjab) Through Collector, Bahawalpur & 2 Others 
(1971 SCMR 447) held as under:- 
“Even if section 11 of the Civil Procedure Code may not 
in terms apply in support of the plea of res judicata, it 
can hardly be disputed that the general principles of res 
judicata were clearly attracted to debar the petitioner 
from re-agitating the matter afresh by a civil suit, which 
had been put at rest by a judgment of the High Court 
passed in writ jurisdiction. The civil Court could not 
have by-passed or overridden the orders of the High 
Court competently made in another jurisdiction on the 
same subject between the same parties.”   
In a case cited as Muhammad Akhtar etc. Vs. Abdul Hadi etc. 
(1981 SCMR 878), the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan held 
as under: 
“It is obvious that after the aforesaid adjudication by 
this Court, a fresh suit to reagitate the same matter 
could not have been filed by the respondent which was 
nothing but an abuse of the process of law. Moreover in 
sub-section (2) of section 12 of the C.P.C (1908) it is 
laid down that “where a person challenges the validity, 
of a judgment, decree or order on the plea of fraud, 
misrepresentation or want of jurisdiction, he shall seek 
his remedy by making an application to the Court which

Court and maintain the orders of the Courts below

was dismissed in that form. Parties to bear their own
