Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – On 14.09.2023 at 03:05 a.m.,  
Sub-Inspector Muhammad Nawaz Kahloon (Respondent No.6) lodged FIR 
No.1701/2023 at Police Station Wahdat Colony, Lahore, under section  
9-(1)3c of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 (CNSA). He 
reported that earlier the same night, around 02:45 a.m., he had arrested 
Muhammad Ashfaq, son of Hafeez Ullah, on source information and seized 
1460 grams of charas from his possession. The investigation of this case 
was assigned to Respondent No.7. He produced Ashfaq before the Area 
Magistrate the following afternoon, who remanded him to judicial custody. 
2. 
 
The Petitioner, who is Ashfaq’s wife, has a cross-version. 
According to her, on 13.09.2023, she went to her parents’ house at Faizpur 
Attari, District Sheikhupura, along with Ashfaq and their children. The 
same evening, around 06:30 p.m., 6/7 unknown persons dressed in plain 
clothes barged into the house, mercilessly beat Ashfaq and then dragged

him out. A black Toyota Corolla Car No.TEU-552, three motorcycles and 
three unknown persons, out of whom two were wearing police uniforms, 
were waiting for them. They forced Ashfaq into the car and sped away. At 
about 07:15 p.m., the Petitioner called the police emergency helpline ‘15’ 
from her cellphone (No. 0320-8425380) and reported the incident, but no 
assistance arrived. Approximately 30 minutes later, she received a call 
from Ashfaq’s cellphone (No. 0308-1120813), and an unidentified person 
spoke to her. He warned her against pursuing legal action and threatened 
that she would put Ashfaq’s life and liberty in danger if she proceeded. The 
said person then handed over the phone to Ashfaq who told her that 
Respondent No.6 was taking him to Police Station Wahdat Colony, Lahore. 
The Petitioner alleges that half an hour later, she received another call from 
her husband’s phone. Ashfaq conveyed that Respondent No.6 was 
demanding a ransom of Rs.500,000/- for his release. She lacked the means 
to meet such a demand. Upon seeing her helplessness, the amount was 
lowered to Rs.200,000/-. Despite her earnest efforts, the Petitioner could 
not raise even the reduced sum. Consequently, Respondent No.6 framed 
Ashfaq in a narcotics case through FIR No.1701/2023. The Petitioner 
asserts that between the initial call and the registration of the FIR at 03:05 
a.m. on 14.09.2023, Ashfaq contacted her multiple times at the behest of 
Respondent No.6. She possesses recordings of all those calls, which she 
could present as evidence when required. 
3. 
 
The Petitioner filed applications with senior police officers 
requesting them to obtain CCTV footage from the Punjab Safe Cities 
Authority (PSCA) and call data records (CDRs) of Cellphone Nos.  
0320-8425380 and 0308-1120813 from the cellular companies concerned 
for the relevant period but they did not take any action. On 02.10.2023, the 
Petitioner submitted two applications addressed to the Director General and 
the Chief Operating Officer of the PSCA (Respondents No.1 & 2, 
respectively) for providing camera footage regarding the incident of 
September 13th and the record of her call to the police helpline ‘15’ that 
day. However, her request was declined through a letter dated 19.10.2023. 
Meanwhile, on 18.10.2023, she filed an application under sections 22-A & 
22-B of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 (hereinafter referred to as the 
“Code” or “Cr.P.C.”) before the Ex-officio Justice of Peace, Lahore, 

Writ Petition No.78006/2023 
 
 
 
- 3 - 
praying that Respondents No.1 & 2 be directed to provide the requisite 
CCTV footage and call data to Respondent No.7, who was investigating 
case FIR No. 1701/2023. She further requested that Respondent No.7 be 
directed to receive and incorporate this evidence into the police file and 
conclude the investigation in accordance with the law. The Ex-officio 
Justice of Peace dismissed the said application by order dated 07.11.2023 
on the ground that it would amount to interference in the investigation of 
FIR No.1701/2023, which is prohibited under the law. 
4. 
 
Through this petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”), the Petitioner 
prays for the same relief she sought in her application under section 
22-A & 22-B Cr.P.C. 
5. 
 
This Court issued notices to the Respondents and also sought a 
report and para-wise comments from the PSCA which it submitted.  
6. 
 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
7. 
 
The “right to information” is a fundamental human right 
recognized and protected by international human rights jurisprudence. This 
right is often considered essential for the functioning of democratic 
societies and is closely linked to the principles of transparency, 
accountability, and the right to freedom of expression. The right to 
information empowers individuals to access information held by public 
authorities, fostering informed decision-making and civic engagement and 
preventing corruption. 
8. 
 
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), 
adopted in 1948, enshrines the right to information in Article 19, which 
states: “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this 
right includes freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas 
through any media and regardless of frontiers.” This provision lays the 
foundation for the right to information as an integral component of 
freedom of expression. 
9. 
 
The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR), another cornerstone of international human rights law, reinforces 
the right to information in Article 19. It echoes the sentiments expressed in 

Writ Petition No.78006/2023 
 
 
 
- 4 - 
the UDHR, emphasizing the significance of freedom of expression and 
recognizing the pivotal role of access to information. 
10. 
 
Additionally, regional human rights instruments, such as the 
European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the American 
Convention on Human Rights, incorporate provisions related to the right to 
information. For example, Article 10.1 of the ECHR states: “Everyone has 
the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold 
opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without 
interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers.” 
11. 
 
On a global scale, the United Nations (U.N.) has been actively 
promoting the right to information. The U.N. General Assembly, in its 
Resolution 59/1, recognized that “freedom of information is a fundamental 
human right and ... the touchstone of all the freedoms to which the United 
Nations is consecrated.” The U.N. also designated September 28 as the 
International Day for Universal Access to Information to emphasize the 
importance of this right. 
12. 
 
The right to information is, however, not absolute. Legal 
provisions often allow for restrictions, particularly in national security, 
public order and safety, personal privacy, commercial interests, law 
enforcement, State secrets, intellectual property rights, and the prevention 
of hate speech and defamation. The challenge lies in balancing the right to 
access information and other societal interests. International human rights 
instruments stress that any restrictions should be prescribed by law, 
necessary, proportionate, and serve legitimate objectives. 
13. 
 
Numerous countries have adopted specific legislation to give 
effect to the right to information. In Pakistan, Article 19 of the Constitution 
of 1973 guarantees every citizen the “freedom of speech and expression”. 
In a landmark ruling in the case of Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif v. 
President of Pakistan and others (PLD 1993 SC 473), the Supreme Court 
of Pakistan affirmed that this freedom encompasses the right to receive 
information. Subsequently, in 2010, Article 19A was introduced into  
Part-II 
Chapter-I 
of 
the 
Constitution 
through 
the 
Constitution  
(Eighteenth Amendment) Act 2010. This Amendment established the right 
to access information as an independent fundamental right in matters of 

Writ Petition No.78006/2023

public importance. Article 19A is reproduced below for facility of 
reference: 
19A. Every citizen shall have the right to have access to information in 
all matters of public importance subject to regulation and reasonable 
restrictions imposed by law. 
14. 
 
In Watan Party and others v. Federation of Pakistan and 
others (PLD 2012 SC 292), the Supreme Court of Pakistan underscored the 
transformative impact of Article 19A in empowering citizens. It stated that 
this constitutional provision elevates access to information from a 
discretionary grant by the State to an enforceable right for the people. 
Article 19 has enabled every citizen to break free from the dominance of 
power centres that previously controlled information on matters of public 
importance. Additionally, the Supreme Court highlighted that this 
constitutional provision shields citizens from dependence on external 
sources or leaks for vital information, thus reinforcing the pillars of 
responsible and accountable governance as envisaged in the constitutional 
framework. 
15. 
 
In Justice Qazi Faez Isa and others v. President of Pakistan 
and others (PLD 2023 SC 661), the Supreme Court highlighted that Article 
19A of the Constitution is framed in “positive” terms, which signifies that 
it grants citizens the proactive right to access information. It restricts the 
State from withholding information on matters of public importance and 
mandates it to take active measures to ensure citizens’ access to such 
information. The Supreme Court recognized that the State functions 
through its various organs – the Legislature, the Executive, and the 
Judiciary – and stressed that the responsibility to uphold the fundamental 
right outlined in Article 19A rests on all these branches.  
16. 
 
The right to information granted under Article 19A of the 
Constitution is not absolute. It is subject to two things: (a) it is restricted to 
matters of public importance, and (b) it is subject to regulation and 
reasonable restrictions imposed by law. In the Province of Punjab v. 
Qaisar Iqbal and others (PLD 2018 Lahore 198), a Full Bench of this 
Court noted that Article 19A of the Constitution does not define the 
expression “public importance”. Therefore, it adopted its dictionary 
meaning according to which it means “question which affects and has its 

Writ Petition No.78006/2023 
 
 
 
- 6 - 
repercussions on the public-at-large, and it also includes the purpose and 
aim in which the general interest of the community, particularly the interest 
of individual, is directly or widely concerned.”1 In Justice Qazi Faez Isa 
and others v. President of Pakistan and others (PLD 2023 SC 661), the 
Supreme Court elucidated the phrase “matters of public importance” 
occurring in Article 19A in light of the jurisprudence developed in respect 
of Articles 184(3), 186(1) and 212(3) of the Constitution, which employ 
similar terminology. The Supreme Court stated: 
“Therefore, as per the judicial definition, the expression ‘matters of 
public importance’ used in Article 19A means the matters that pertain to 
and affect the public at large, a whole community, and not an individual 
or a small group of individuals. In other words, it includes the matters in 
which the general interest of a whole community, as opposed to the 
particular interest of individuals, is directly and vitally concerned. The 
adjective ‘public’ necessarily implies a matter relating to the people at 
large, the nation, the State or a community as a whole. If a matter in 
which only a particular individual or group of individuals is interested, 
and the people at large or an entire community have no interest, that 
cannot be treated as a matter of public importance.” 
17. 
 
The second vital condition specified in Article 19A of the 
Constitution is that the right to information is subject to regulation and 
reasonable restrictions imposed by law. In Pakistan Broadcasters 
Association and others v. Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory 
Authority and others (PLD 2016 SC 692), the Supreme Court defined the 
expression “reasonable restriction” as follows: 
“It is certainly not easy to define ‘reasonableness’ with precision. It is 
neither possible nor advisable to prescribe any abstract standard of 
universal application of reasonableness. However, factors such as the 
nature of the right infringed, the duration and extent of the restriction, the 
causes and circumstances prompting the restriction, and the manner as 
well as the purpose for which the restrictions are imposed are to be 
considered. The extent of the malice sought to be prevented and/or 
remedied, and the disproportion of the restriction may also be examined 
in the context of reasonableness or otherwise of the imposition. It needs 
to be kept in mind that ‘reasonable’ implies intelligent care and 
deliberation, that is, the choice of course that reason dictates. For an 
action to be qualified as reasonable, it must also be just right and fair, 
and should neither be arbitrary nor fanciful or oppressive.”   
18. 
 
The Punjab Transparency and Right to Information Act 2013 
(the “Information Act”) seeks to actualize the right to information 
guaranteed by Article 19A of the Constitution to the extent of the 
provincial bodies mentioned in clause (h) of section 2 of the Act. This 
                                          
1 The same interpretation was made by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in Ch. Muhammad Akram v. 
Registrar, Islamabad High Court and others (PLD 2016 SC 961) and the Supreme Court of India in State 
of Jammu and Kashmir v.  Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad (AIR 1967 SC 122).

legislation extends to the whole of the Punjab. On the other hand, 
Parliament has enacted the Right to Access to Information Act, 2017, 
which applies to all public bodies of the Federal Government. 
19. 
 
The Punjab Assembly has also enacted Act I of 2016. The 
Punjab Safe Cities Authority was established under Act I of 2016  
(the “PSCA Act”) for the construction, development and maintenance of an 
integrated command, control and communication (IC3) system for police in 
major cities of the province for public safety through the use of modern 
technology, infrastructure and processes.2 In exercise of the powers 
conferred on it under section 19 of the PSCA Act of 2016, the Authority 
has framed PSCA Electronic Data Regulations 2016 (“EDR-16”), which 
cover the whole process of collection, analysis, storage, presentation and 
use of the electronic data. These are supplemented by the Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs) for PPIC 3 Centre, Lahore. 
20. 
 
Recently, PSCA has developed the concept of Police Unified 
Communication and Response (PUCAR-15), which integrates 15 call 
centres and 15 response systems. It is operational across the province.  
21. 
 
Regulation 3(2) of EDR-16 states that, through the IC3 
Project, a quantum of electronic data within the range of ancillary facility is 
generated (a) to help the prosecution in criminal cases, crime detection, 
investigating, inquiry or trial; and (b) to be used as an authentic piece of 
evidence in any investigation, inquiry, or trial; and (c) to maintain law and 
order. Regulation 2(1)(d) explains that “ ‘electronic data’ means any 
probative data or information in the form of videos/audio/picture, stored or 
transmitted in electronic format or on electronic media duly collected, 
recorded, generated or extracted through the ancillary facilities/equipment 
installed under the [PSCA] Act.”  
22. 
 
The PSCA has defined a procedure for the presentation of 
electronic data in Regulation No.9(1) of EDR-16. Regulation 9(1) 
stipulates that the PSCA shall only provide the data it collects to the 
Investigating Officers, law enforcement agencies (LEAs), courts, tribunals 
or any other authorized person for investigation, inquiry or trial as

evidence. It follows that the PSCA’s data can be used for certain specific 
purposes only, i.e. for matters under inquiry, investigation or trial. Most 
importantly, under EDR-16, no person, institution or office other than those 
mentioned above can apply for and obtain any data from the Authority. 
EDR-16 prescribes a special form for electronic data requests (EDR Form), 
which means that a request to provide electronic data in any other mode is 
not entertainable.3 
23. 
 
According to Regulation 3(3) the electronic data generated 
through the IC3 facility shall be preserved and made available: (a) in the 
PSCA’s Data Centre for 30 days except otherwise required by the PSCA; 
(b) for two months after it is stored in electronic data storage device 
[(defined in Regulation 2(1)(h)]; (c) upto seven years on instructions of the 
PSCA.  
24. 
 
The PSCA Act of 2016, EDR-16, and the SOPs serve as 
regulatory framework for the PSCA to share the information it gathers. 
Notably, they do not prohibit the PSCA from sharing with the accused or 
the complainant party in a criminal case. Instead, they only establish 
procedural protocols and streamline the process to ensure that access is 
granted in a manner that prevents misuse and does not impede ongoing 
investigations. In Pakistan Fisheries Ltd., Karachi, and others v. United 
Bank Ltd. (PLD 1993 SC 109), the Supreme Court of Pakistan stated: 
“It is a fundamental rule that where an enactment creates a new 
jurisdiction and prescribes the manner in which that jurisdiction is to be 
exercised and further specifies the remedy, such remedy is exclusive, and 
the party aggrieved of an order made in exercise of that jurisdiction must 
seek only such remedy and not others.” 
25. 
 
Mr. Ali has failed to persuade this Court that PSCA Act of 
2016, EDR-16, or the SOPs contain anything that violates the Petitioner’s 
rights under Article 19A of the Constitution – so far as this case is 
concerned.  
26. 
 
In view of the above, if an officer investigating a case requires 
CCTV footage from the PSCA systems or ‘15’ call data record, he may 
apply to PSCA on the EDR Form. On the other hand, if he requires CDRs 
from any cellular company, he must follow the law elucidated by a Full

Bench of this Court in Mst. Saima Noreen v. State and another (PLJ 2023 
Cr.C. 371). The law regarding probative value of CDRs and the guiding 
principles for their use in legal proceedings can inter alia be found in the 
said judgment and the following cases: Ishtiaq Ahmed Mirza v. 
Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2019 SC 675); Azeem Khan v. Mujahid 
Khan (2016 SCMR 274); Mian Khalid Perviz v. The State and another 
(2021 SCMR 522); Shameem Bibi v. The State and others (2022 SCMR 
2077); Rashed alias Chand and others v. The State (2022 PCr.LJ 664); 
and Noor Ahmed alias Ahmed Agha v. The State (2022 PCr.LJ 1126). 
27. 
 
The Petitioner’s applications to Respondents No.1 & 2 were 
not maintainable for two reasons: first, they were on plain papers and not in 
the prescribed form (EDR Form); secondly, under Regulation 9(1), the 
PSCA is not authorized to entertain requests from private persons for the 
provision of any data. Only investigating officers, LEAs, courts, tribunals, 
or other authorized persons may collect specific data for a particular 
purpose in matters under inquiry or investigation or cases pending 
adjudication. Therefore, the PSCA rightly declined the Petitioner’s request 
vide letter dated 19.10.2023. 
28. 
 
Confronted with the above situation, Mr. Ali sought to invoke 
the Information Act of 2013 to assert the Petitioner’s right to have the data 
in question. The Additional Advocate General responds that the PSCA Act 
of 2016 would prevail over the Information Act as it is a special law. I am 
inclined to agree with her. The 2013 Act deals generally with the right to 
information. The following excerpt from Allahabad Bank v. Canara Bank 
and another [(2000) 4 SCC 406], decided by the Indian Supreme Court, is 
instructive: 
“At the same time, High Courts have rightly held that the Companies Act 
is a general Act and does not prevail under the RDB Act [Recovery of 
Debts due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993]. They have 
relied upon Union of India vs. India Fisheries [1965 (3) SCR 679]. There 
can be a situation in law where the same statute is treated as a special 
statute vis-a-vis one legislation and again as a general statute vis-a-vis 
yet another legislation. Such situations do arise as held in Life Insurance 
Corporation of India vs. D.J.Bahadur [AIR 1980 SC 2181]. It was there 
observed: “for certain cases, an Act may be general and for certain other 
purposes, it may be special and the Court cannot blur a distinction when 
dealing with finer points of law”. For example, a Rent Control Act may 
be a special statute as compared to the Code of Civil Procedure. But vis-
a-vis an Act permitting eviction from public premises or some special 
class of buildings, the Rent Control Act may be a general statute. In fact 
in Damji Valji Shah and Anr. vs. Life Insurance Corporation of India

- 10 -
and Ors. (1965(3) SCR 665 = AIR 1965 SC 135 already referred to), this 
Court has observed that vis-a-vis the LIC Act 1956, the Companies Act, 
1956 can be treated as a general statute. This is clear from para 19 of that 
judgment. It was observed: “Further, the provisions of the Special Act, 
i.e. LIC Act, will override the provisions of the general Act, viz; the 
Companies Act which is an Act relating to companies in general”. Thus, 
some High Courts rightly treated the Companies Act as a general statute, 
and the RDB Act as a special statute overriding the general statute. 
Special law versus special law: Alternatively, the Companies Act, 1956 
and the RDB Act can both be treated as special laws, and the principle 
that when there are two special laws, the latter will normally prevail over 
the former if there is a provision in the latter special Act giving it 
overriding effect, can also be applied. Such a provision is there in the 
RDB Act, namely, section 34.” 
29. 
 
Even if it is assumed that the Information Act of 2013 is not a 
general law and both it and the PSCA Act of 2016 are special laws, the 
latter would take precedence as it was enacted subsequently. There is no 
clause in either statute giving it an overriding effect. Reliance is placed on 
Solidaire India Ltd. v. Fairgrowth Financial Services Ltd. and others 
(2001) 3 SCC 71. 
30. 
 
It is noteworthy that section 13(1) of the Information Act of 
2013 places certain restrictions on the disclosure of information by the 
provincial bodies.4 According to clause (f) of section 13(1), information 
required by an individual may be refused if deemed necessary for the 
administration of justice. This clause is quite expansive and can be invoked 
to reject the Petitioner’s direct request for the data, requiring her to 
approach through the Investigating Officer. 
31. 
 
According to Paul B. Weston et al., “criminal investigation is 
a lawful search for people and things useful in reconstructing the 
                                          
4 Section 13 of the Punjab Transparency and Right to Information Act, 2013, reads as follows: 
13. Exceptions.– (1) A public information officer may refuse an application for access to 
information where disclosure of the information shall or is likely to cause harm to–  
(a)  
national defence or security, public order or international relations of Pakistan;  
(b)  
a legitimate privacy interest, unless the person concerned has consented to 
disclosure of the information;  
(c)  
the protection of legally privileged information or of the rules relating to 
breach of confidence;  
(d)  
the legitimate commercial interests of a public body or a third party, including 
information subject to third party intellectual property rights;  
(e)  
the life, health or safety of any person;  
(f)  
the prevention or detection of crime, the apprehension or prosecution of 
offenders, or the administration of justice;  
(g)  
the ability of the Government to manage the economy; or  
(h)  
the effective formulation of or success of a policy either by its premature 
disclosure or by restraining the free and frank provision of advice within the 
Government.

circumstances of an illegal act or omission and the mental state 
accompanying it. It is probing from the known to the unknown, backward 
in time, and its goal is to determine the truth as far as it can be discovered 
in any post-factum inquiry.”5 Article 4 of the Constitution states that 
enjoying the protection of the law and being treated in accordance with the 
law is the inalienable right of every citizen, wherever he may be, and of 
every other person currently within Pakistan. Article 10A guarantees the 
right to a fair trial. Fair investigation is concomitant with this right.6 It is 
also recognized as essential to the right to life and personal liberty.7 It is a 
minimum requirement of the rule of law8 and necessary to ensure the 
integrity of the criminal justice system.  
32. 
 
Section 4(l) Cr.P.C. gives a statutory definition of the term 
“investigation”, stating that it encompasses all the proceedings under the 
Code for the collection of evidence conducted by a police officer or by any 
person (other than a Magistrate) whom a Magistrate authorizes for this 
purpose. In Kailash Vijayvargiya v. Rajlakshmi Chaudhuri (2023), the 
Supreme Court of India noted the investigative process under the Code 
generally consists of the following steps: (a) proceeding to the scene of the 
incident; (b) establishing the facts and circumstances surrounding the case; 
(c) identifying and apprehending the suspected offender; (d) collecting 
evidence relevant to the alleged offence, which may involve examination 
of various persons, including the accused, and documenting their 
statements if deemed necessary by the investigating officer; (e) conducting 
searches at relevant locations and seizing items deemed necessary for the 
investigation and potential trial; and (f) forming an opinion based on the 
collected evidence as to whether there are sufficient grounds to bring the 
accused before the Magistrate for trial, and if so, taking the necessary steps 
such as filing a report under section 173 Cr.P.C. 
33. 
 
In Vinay Tyagi v. Irshad Ali alias Deepak and others  
[(2013) 5 SCC 762], the Supreme Court of India explained that in criminal 
jurisprudence, the expression “fair and proper investigation” connotes two

things: firstly, the investigation should be honest, unbiased and in 
accordance with law, and secondly, the entire emphasis should be to dig 
out the truth and bring it before the court of justice. Rule 25.2(3) of the 
Police Rules, 1934, embodies this principle. It states that it is the duty of an 
investigating officer to find out the truth of the matter under investigation. 
His objective shall be to discover the actual facts of the case and arrest the 
real offender or offenders. He must not prematurely commit to any view of 
the facts for or against anyone. In Mst. Sughran Bibi v. The State  
(PLD 2018 SC 595), the Supreme Court of Pakistan emphasized that 
investigations must not be confined solely to the narrative presented in the 
FIR or the allegations contained therein. The Investigating Officer should 
not feel obligated to validate the accuracy of the incident as described in 
the FIR and should not allow the contents of the FIR to influence his 
judgment or control his actions. If the information received by the local 
police about the commission of a cognizable offence also contained a 
version as to how the relevant offence was committed, by whom it was 
committed, and in which background it was committed, then that version of 
the incident was only the version of the informant and nothing more. The 
Investigating Officer should not unreservedly accept such a version as the 
truth or the whole truth. Instead, following the registration of the FIR, he 
should conduct an impartial inquiry to ascertain the facts of the matter, 
gathering information from various sources and arriving at their own 
conclusions. The final report submitted under section 173 Cr.P.C. should 
reflect the Investigating Officer’s independent opinion, uninfluenced by the 
statements or allegations made in the FIR. 
34. 
 
There are frequent complaints against investigating officers, 
alleging that, due to dishonesty, negligence, or other factors, they fail to 
include crucial evidence in the case record, thereby impeding the fair 
adjudication of the matter. The present case is a classic example of such an 
instance. The Petitioner’s husband, Ashfaq, stands accused of an offence 
under section 9-(1)3c of the CNSA, which is punishable with rigorous 
imprisonment up to fourteen years, with a minimum of nine years, and a 
fine ranging from eighty thousand to four hundred thousand rupees. The 
Petitioner believes that Ashfaq can be cleared of the charge if certain data 
from the PSCA is brought into the case file, but the law prohibits the PSCA 

Writ Petition No.78006/2023

from directly providing her with this data. The opposing party, in this case, 
is the police themselves. The Petitioner sought the indulgence of superior 
police officers, but they did not respond. Then she approached the  
Ex-officio Justice of Peace under section 22-A Cr.P.C., but he also refused 
to intervene. It is necessary to outline what remedies an individual has 
when the police officer does not bring the relevant evidence on record, 
which is imperative for the just decision of the case. 
35. 
 
The Police Order 2002 provides various remedies for the 
individual dissatisfied with the investigation of a case. Firstly, under 
Article 18(9), he can approach the supervisory officer charged with the 
duty to ensure timely completion and verification of the investigation. The 
said officer may summon the investigation officer, review the case file, 
evaluate the evidence, and issue instructions to the investigation officer in 
the form of a case diary. Article 18(10) provides that a supervisory officer 
not below the rank of a Deputy Superintendent of Police may verify the 
correctness of the investigation and the accuracy of the conclusions of the 
investigation by writing a case diary before submitting a report to the court. 
Secondly, the aggrieved person can seek the transfer of the investigation 
for which Article 18-A provides a complete mechanism. Thirdly, he can 
file a complaint to the Provincial Police Complaints Authority under 
Article 106. The PPCA is an independent body that oversees the 
performance and accountability of the police. It can inquire into the 
complaint and direct the investigating officer to take appropriate action or 
refer the matter to the competent authority for disciplinary or criminal 
action against him. 
36. 
 
An individual dissatisfied with the investigation may also 
invoke section 551 Cr.P.C., which reads as follows: 
551. Powers of superior officers of police. – Police officers superior in 
rank to an officer in-charge of a police station may exercise the same 
powers, throughout the local area to which they are appointed, as may be 
exercised by such officer within the limits of his station.  
37. 
 
An Ex-officio Justice of Peace can also be helpful to an 
individual aggrieved by police conduct. Clause (iii) of section 22-A(6) 
Cr.P.C. empowers him to issue appropriate directions to the concerned 
police authorities on a complaint regarding neglect, failure, or excess 
committed by a police officer concerning his functions and duties. 

Writ Petition No.78006/2023

However, it is crucial to note that this provision is limited in scope. In 
Khizer Hayat and others v. Inspector General of Police (Punjab), Lahore 
and others (PLD 2005 Lahore 470), a Full Bench of this Court ruled that 
the directives of the Ex-officio Justice of Peace under section 22-A Cr.P.C. 
must conform strictly to the relevant legal framework. He must not usurp 
the powers of other authorities and address grievances directly. 
Nevertheless, there is an exception to this principle in cases where a clear 
legal obligation mandates a specific action by a police officer. In such 
instances, the Ex-officio Justice of the Peace may issue directives to ensure 
compliance with legal obligations. The Court further stated that the role of 
an Ex-officio Justice of Peace under section 22-A(6) Cr.P.C. is primarily 
that of a facilitator and mediator between complainants and the relevant 
police authorities. Effective communication and cooperation are essential 
for addressing grievances under this jurisdiction.  
38. 
 
Section 36 Cr.P.C. stipulates that all Magistrates have the 
powers specified in the Third Schedule. Such powers are called the 
“ordinary powers”. Section 37 further provides that, upon the High Court’s 
recommendation, the Provincial Government may empower any Magistrate 
with additional powers listed in the Fourth Schedule alongside their 
ordinary powers. A review of the Third Schedule reveals that Magistrates 
of the First and Second Classes have the ordinary power under section 
155(2) Cr.P.C. to direct the police to investigate cases involving non-
cognizable offences where they have the jurisdiction to try or send to the 
Court of Session or the High Court for trial. It is well-settled that when a 
power is given to an authority to do something, it includes such incidental 
or implied powers that would ensure the proper doing of that thing. In other 
words, when the statute expressly grants any power, there is impliedly 
included in the grant, even without special mention, every power and every 
control the denial of which would render the grant itself ineffective.9 
Therefore, the aforementioned power to order the police to investigate 
cases involving non-cognizable offences under section 155(2) Cr.P.C. 
includes all such incidental powers essential to ensure a proper 
investigation.

39. 
 
Section 156 Cr.P.C. deals with the investigation of cognizable 
offences, and its sub-section (3) plays a vital role in maintaining the rule of 
law. It empowers Magistrates to intervene when the police fail to address 
complaints or information concerning cognizable offences and ensures that 
they are investigated fairly, impartially, and thoroughly. In Mohd. Yousuf 
v. Smt. Afaq Jahan & another (AIR 2006 SC 705), the Supreme Court of 
India analyzed the scope of section 156(3) of India’s Code of Criminal 
Procedure of 1973, which mirrors section 156(3) of our Code. It stated that 
while section 156(1)10 allows an officer in charge of a police station to 
investigate any cognizable offence without a Magistrate’s order, section 
156(3) empowers a Magistrate to intervene if needed. The Supreme Court 
highlighted that although the investigations under section 156(3) also end 
up with a report under section 173 – the same outcome as police-initiated 
investigations – the significant point is that investigations under section 
156(3) occur before the Magistrate takes cognizance of the offence. Thus, 
it offers a pre-cognizance check on the police. The Supreme Court further 
stated that the investigation under section 156(3) is distinguishable from 
the one under section 202 of the Indian Code.11 The latter is limited in 
scope and is only to help the Magistrate decide whether to proceed further 
with the complaint.  
40. 
 
In Sakiri Vasu vs State of U.P. and others (AIR 2008 SC 
907), the Indian Supreme Court ruled that section 156(3) provides for a 
check by a Magistrate on the police. If he finds that they have not done 
their duty of investigating the case at all, or have not done it satisfactorily, 
he can issue necessary directives to ensure its thoroughness. The Supreme 
Court said: “Section 156(3) Cr.P.C., though briefly worded, is very wide 
and will include all such incidental powers as necessary for ensuring a 
proper investigation.” It further stated that the Magistrate can also monitor 
the investigation under this provision. 
41. 
 
In M. Subramaniam v. Janki (AIROnline 2020 SC 387), the 
Indian Supreme Court reaffirmed the above view, clarifying that although 
the Magistrate is empowered to monitor the progress of the investigation, 
                                          
10 Section 156(1) of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure Code 1973 is analogous to section 156(1) of 
Pakistan’s Code of Criminal Procedure 1898. 
 
11 This correspondents to a similar provision of our Code.

he is not authorized to conduct the investigation himself because this 
responsibility lies with the police. Citing State of Bihar and another v. 
J.A.C. Saldanha and others (AIR 1980 SC 326), it stated: 
“17. 
 In our opinion section 156(3) Cr.P.C. is wide enough to include 
all such powers in a Magistrate which are necessary for ensuring a 
proper investigation, and it includes the power to order registration of an 
FIR and of ordering a proper investigation if the Magistrate is satisfied 
that a proper investigation has not been done, or is not being done by the 
police. Section 156(3) Cr.P.C., though briefly worded, in our opinion, is 
very wide and it will include all such incidental powers as are necessary 
for ensuring a proper investigation. 
“18. 
It is well settled that when a power is given to an authority to do 
something it includes such incidental or implied powers which would 
ensure the proper doing of that thing. In other words, when any power is 
expressly granted by the statute, there is impliedly included in the grant, 
even without special mention, every power and every control the denial 
of which would render the grant itself ineffective. Thus, where an Act 
confers jurisdiction it impliedly also grants the power of doing all such 
acts or employ such means as are essentially necessary for its execution.” 
42. 
 
Here, I must also refer to section 94(1) Cr.P.C. It stipulates 
that whenever any court, or any officer in charge of a police station 
considers that the production of any document or other thing is necessary 
or desirable for any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under 
the Code before it, such court may issue a summons, or such officer a 
written order, to the person in whose possession or power such document 
or thing is believed to be, requiring him to attend and produce it, or to 
produce it, at the time and place stated in the summons or order. The words 
“whenever” and “thing” in section 94 Cr.P.C. are significant. “Whenever” 
indicates that a court can exercise the power to require the production of 
any document or other thing at any stage during an inquiry or trial. The 
only condition is that it must be necessary or desirable for the proceedings.  
43. 
 
In The State v. Chaudhry Muhammad Usman (2023 SCMR 
1676), the Supreme Court of Pakistan addressed two questions: (i) whether 
an accused can request the court, before the commencement of trial, to 
order the production of documents not covered under section 265-C 
Cr.P.C., and (ii) whether an accused can make such a request before 
presenting 
a 
defence, 
despite 
the 
existence 
of 
section  
265-F(7) Cr.P.C., which provides that, after entering on his defence, an 
accused can apply to the trial court to issue any process for compelling the 
production of any document. The Supreme Court answered both questions 
in the affirmative. It ruled that any party may apply to the court for an order 

Writ Petition No.78006/2023 
 
 
 
- 17 -
under section 94 Cr.P.C. and the court would allow its request if the 
condition mentioned above is satisfied. It clarified that section 265-F(7) 
does not control or limit the power of a court under section 94(1). 
“The provisions of these two sections differ from each other in their extent 
and scope. They are not opposed to each other. Section 94(1) affords both 
the parties to an inquiry or trial (not to the accused alone) the opportunity 
of causing the production of any document at any stage of such inquiry or 
trial, with the condition that the party applying for it must satisfy the court 
that the production of the required document is necessary or desirable for 
the purposes of the inquiry or trial. Section 265-F(7), on the other hand, 
only gives the accused another similar opportunity at the stage of his 
defence subject to a lesser condition, which is that his application should 
not be for the purpose of vexation or delay or defeating the ends of justice.” 
44. 
 
In Shakeel Akhtar v. The State etc. (2023 LHC 7704), this 
Court determined that the word “thing” in section 94 Cr.P.C. should be 
broadly construed to encompass anything relevant to the offence, the 
production of which would promote the cause of justice. The relevant 
excerpt is reproduced below: 
“Section 94 Cr.P.C., Articles 24, 40, 59 and 164 of QSO [the Qanun-e-
Shahadat 1984] and Rule 2 of Chapter 1-E, Volume III of the Rules & 
Orders of the Lahore High Court, must be given a purposive 
interpretation. In particular, the term “thing” used in section 94 Cr.P.C. 
and Article 161 of QSO must be given a broad meaning and understood 
to signify anything connected with the offence whose production will 
serve the interest of justice. In Abdul Latif Aassi v. The State (1999 MLD 
1069 : 2001 P.Cr.R. 548), Asif Saeed Khan Khosa J. stated that contrary 
to the general perception that we have an adversarial justice system, 
sections 245(1), 540, 428 and 561-A Cr.P.C., Article 161 of QSO and 
Rule 2, supra, cut over that paradigm and allow the courts to take an 
inquisitorial approach in certain circumstances. Therefore, in a criminal 
case, a trial court can rectify an intentional or unintentional lapse on the 
part of the complainant, the Investigating Officer or the prosecuting 
counsel by calling in evidence on its own if it can have a bearing on the 
determination of guilt or innocence of the accused person. Such authority 
must be granted to a criminal court in the larger interest of the 
community. The stage of the trial is irrelevant for this purpose. The only 
factor important for exercising such power is that the evidence called is 
relevant.”12 
45. 
 
Sections 156(3) and 94(1) of the Code play crucial roles 
within the legal framework, contributing to the fair and effective 
administration of justice. Nevertheless, they serve different purposes. 
                                          
12 Also see: Zaheer Ahmed v. Judge, Special Court and others (PLD 2023 Lahore 528), and Muhammad 
Asif Ali Usama v. The State and others (2022 PCr.LJ 59).

Section 156(3) empowers Magistrates to intervene when the police do not 
adequately address complaints or information regarding cognizable 
offences. It allows Magistrates to direct the police to investigate the alleged 
offence properly. In contrast, section 94(1) deals with the production of 
documents and evidence during legal proceedings (including investigation, 
inquiry, trial or other proceedings under the Code). 
46. 
 
In summary, the Police Order 2002 and sections 22-A(6), 551, 
155(2), 156(3), and 94 of the Code effectively address complaints 
regarding an unsatisfactory police investigation. These remedies are not 
mutually exclusive. However, an individual must be vigilant and resort to 
the most effective one in a given situation. 
47. 
 
The right to a fair trial is as much to the accused as the 
complainant/victim party. In Zahira Habibullah Sheikh and another v. 
State of Gujarat and others (AIR 2004 SC 3114), the Indian Supreme 
Court stated that crimes are public wrongs that affect the entire community 
and emphasized the need to balance the interests of the accused, the victim, 
and society. The principles of the rule of law and due process are closely 
linked to human rights protection, and all parties involved in a criminal 
trial have the right to be treated fairly. In this view of the matter, the 
remedies available against flawed or dishonest investigations are equally 
accessible to both the complainant/victim party and the accused. 
48. 
 
The High Court is the guardian of the people’s fundamental 
rights. Article 199 of the Constitution empowers it to enforce fundamental 
rights through the constitutional remedy of writs. These writs include 
habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto, and certiorari. In 
the seminal case of Shahnaz Begum v. The Hon’ble Judges of the High 
Court of Sindh and Baluchistan and another (PLD 1971 SC 677), the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan held that the general rule is that the High Court 
has no jurisdiction under the Constitution or any other law, including the 
Code, to supervise the investigation of a criminal case or to control the 
agency conducting it. The constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court may 
be invoked if the investigation is mala fide or without jurisdiction. In such 
a situation, the High Court may even exercise power under section 491 
Cr.P.C. – though not under section 561-A Cr.P.C. – to release a person if 
he is in detention. Several subsequent decisions approved this view. The

- 19 -
following excerpt from Younas Abbas and others v. Additional Sessions 
Judge, Chakwal, and others (PLD 2016 SC 581) is quite instructive: 
“The investigating authorities do not have an unfettered authority of 
running investigation according to their whim and caprice. They can be 
pushed back to their allotted turf if and when they overstep it. In the case 
of Anwar Ahmed Khan v. The State (1996 SCMR 24), this Court held 
that the High Court, in the exercise of its jurisdiction, was competent to 
pass necessary orders where investigation was mala fide or without 
jurisdiction to ensure justice and fair play. It was also held in the case of 
Muhammad Latif, ASI, Police Station Sadar, Sheikhupura v. Sharifan 
Bibi and another (1998 SCMR 666) that the High Court in the exercise 
of its constitutional jurisdiction, could pass appropriate orders where the 
investigation is mala fide. In the case of Nasrullah Khan v. Manzoor 
Hussain and others (2004 SCMR 885), this Court declined to interfere 
with the order of the High Court directing the entrustment of the 
investigation of the case to some responsible officer of repute. In the 
case of Col. Shah Sadiq v. Muhammad Ashiq and others (2006 SCMR 
276), this Court, after referring to a string of judgments of this Court, 
Privy Council and Indian Supreme Court reiterated the same principle.”  
49. 
 
In view of the above, the High Court retains the authority to 
intervene if the investigation appears to be conducted in bad faith or 
without jurisdiction. In specific situations where it is evident that an 
Investigating Officer is deliberately neglecting to secure crucial evidence, 
potentially motivated by ulterior motives, and the affected individual can 
demonstrate that he has no alternative adequate and efficacious remedy, 
which is a pre-requisite for invoking jurisdiction under Article 199 of the 
Constitution, the High Court may issue a writ of mandamus. Factors such 
as the involvement of police officers in the dispute or their direct or 
indirect interest in the investigation’s outcome, as well as the risk of 
evidence destruction if timely action is not taken (as exemplified by the 
PSCA’s practice of destroying records after a specified period), are crucial 
in determining whether the alternative remedy is adequate and effective 
and whether the High Court should exercise its constitutional jurisdiction. 
Disposition 
50. 
 
The Petitioner’s applications before the PSCA (addressed to 
Respondents No.1 & 2) were not maintainable due to the reasons discussed 
in paragraph 27. Although she had remedies available under the Police 
Order 2002 and sections 551 and 156(3) Cr.P.C., she did not pursue them. 
Instead, she filed an application under section 22-A Cr.P.C. before the Ex-
officio Justice of Peace, who dismissed it through an order dated 
07.11.2023. The dismissal was based on the premise that it would 

Writ Petition No.78006/2023 
 
 
 
- 20 -
constitute interference in the investigation of FIR No.1701/2023, which is 
prohibited under the law. In my opinion, the Ex-officio Justice of Peace 
erred in this determination. As per Khizar Hayat’s case, he could issue 
directives to senior police officers to redress the Petitioner’s grievance. 
51. 
 
The Petitioner filed this constitutional petition on 25.11.2023, 
i.e. 02 months and 12 days after the incident regarding which she has a 
cross-version. By that time, the video recordings had already been disposed 
of. As regards the CDRs mentioned by the Petitioner, the Additional 
Advocate 
General 
submitted 
that 
the 
Investigating 
Officer  
(Respondent No.7) obtained it during the pendency of this petition and 
placed it on the case file. In these circumstances, no further direction need 
be issued. 
52. 
 
I may write an additional note before concluding this 
judgment.  
53. 
 
Recently, the Ministry of Communications, Government of 
Pakistan, approved SOPs (EDAP3) for sharing CCTV footage from 
motorways and highways for conducting investigations by law enforcement 
agencies. These SOPs were submitted to this Court in Crl. Misc. No. 
62979/B/2023 (Hamza Imdad v. The State etc.), which was adjudicated at 
the Principal Seat of this Court on 13.12.2023. Following the prescribed 
protocol, an officer investigating a case may request footage from the 
Ministry of Communications if necessary.  
54. 
 
During the hearing of this case, it was brought to the attention 
of this Court that a significant number of CCTV cameras operated by the 
PSCA are currently not operational. Respondent No.1 is directed to look 
into this matter and take the necessary steps to restore the cameras to full 
functionality as soon as possible. 
55. 
 
The Chief Minister of Punjab, in his capacity as the 
Chairperson of the Punjab PSCA, has appointed the Commissioner of 
Lahore Division as the focal person to resolve Right of Way issues and 
ensure collaboration between various entities and departments. On 
03.08.2017, the Commissioner convened a meeting to address PSCA’s 
infrastructure maintenance and security concerns. It was noted that 
development and repair activities undertaken by various departments such 

Writ Petition No.78006/2023 
 
 
 
- 21 -
as LDA, WASA, PHA, and MCL were damaging the Optical Fibre Cable 
(OFC) network. Therefore, the Commissioner directed that in the future, all 
departments must consult with the PSCA and secure approvals before 
launching any development or Maintenance and Repair (M&R) projects to 
safeguard the existing infrastructure. It has been reported that the above 
directives are not being followed. The Chief Secretary of Punjab is directed 
to look into the matter personally and ensure that there is no such violation 
in the future.
