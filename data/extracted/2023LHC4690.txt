Muzammil Hayat  vs.  Provincial Police Officer etc.  
 
J U D G M E N T 
Date of Hearing: 
26.09.2023 
Petitioner by: 
Mr. Salman Riaz Chaudhry, Advocate.   
Respondents by: 
Mr. Muhammad Anwar Khan, Assistant Attorney 
General.  
Mr. Imran Khan, Assistant Advocate General.  
Ayesha Agha, Additional Director, FIA.  
Ijaz Khalil, Assistant Director Law, FIA.  
A.D. Dhakku, Inspector Legal.  
Mubashar Chaudhry, S.I.  
    Anwaar Hussain, J.   Brief facts of the case are that services of 
the petitioner Muzammil Hayat, Sub-Inspector of Punjab Police, was 
lent to the Federal Investigation Agency (“the FIA”), on deputation 
for three years, through office order dated 10.01.2023. He joined the 
borrowing agency and was posted in the Directorate General, FIA, 
Islamabad. During his deputation with the FIA, a FIR bearing 
No.258/23 dated 15.04.2023 was registered against him with Police 
Station Qadir Pur, District Jhang, under Sections 302, 324, 109, 148, 
149, Pakistan Penal Code, 1860. The petitioner obtained pre-arrest 
bail in the said case, which has been confirmed in his favour by the 
Additional Sessions Judge, Jhang. On account of registration of case 
referred above, the District Police Officer, Jhang vide Memorandum 
dated 11.05.2023 (“the Memorandum”) addressed to the Regional 
Police Officer, Faisalabad requested the latter to initiate repatriation 
of the petitioner, from the FIA, enabling the Police Department to 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.42703/2023 
 
 
2
initiate departmental proceedings. In furtherance thereof, Provincial 
Police Officer, Punjab, Lahore vide office order dated 16.06.2023 
(“the Office Order”) requested the FIA to repatriate the petitioner to 
the Punjab Police, being the lending department, enabling it to 
commence and carry out the disciplinary proceedings against him. 
The petitioner has impugned the Memorandum and the Office Order 
through the present petition, under Article 199 of the Constitution of 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (“the Constitution”). Prayer 
has also been made to allow the petitioner to continue with the 
deputation with the FIA. During the pendency of this petition, the 
FIA repatriated the petitioner to his parent/lending department i.e., 
Punjab Police, vide office order No. 792/2023 dated 19.07.2023 
(“Order dated 19.07.2023”), which was also assailed by the 
petitioner by filing civil miscellaneous application bearing 
No.3/2023.  
2. 
Report and parawise comments have been filed by the Punjab 
Police as well as the FIA. Stance has been taken by the Punjab Police 
that since a criminal case has been registered against the petitioner, 
therefore, the Punjab Police was justified in seeking repatriation of 
the petitioner to probe in the matter in order to initiate disciplinary 
proceedings, if required. Whereas the FIA has averred that there is no 
legal embargo upon the FIA for acceding to the request of the Punjab 
Police to repatriate the petitioner, who was merely a deputationist, 
with the FIA.  
3. 
Mr. Salman Riaz Chaudhry, Advocate, learned counsel for the 
petitioner, contends that the petitioner was transferred from the 
Punjab Police to the FIA, Islamabad, on deputation basis, vide order 
dated 10.01.2023 for a period of three years, however, he has been 
repatriated, vide Order dated 19.07.2023 before lapse of the 
deputation period, without any lawful justification. Adds that in 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.42703/2023 
 
 
3
terms of Rule 11 of the Punjab Police (E&D) Rules, 1975 (“the 
Rules, 1975”), whenever services of an officer of Punjab Police are 
lent to any other department, it is the borrowing agency which has to 
initiate and complete the disciplinary proceedings and, if found 
guilty of misconduct, can impose minor penalty upon the 
deputationist and has to refer the matter to lending agency only if 
major penalty is to be imposed. Places reliance on the law laid down 
in case reported as “Habib Bank Limited v. Ghulam Mustafa 
Khairati” (2008 SCMR 1516) to contend that mere registration of 
the case does not bring the case of an employee within the mischief 
of the term misconduct.    
4. 
Conversely, Mr. Muhammad Anwar Khan, learned Assistant 
Attorney General submits that the FIA has repatriated the petitioner 
to his parent department in accordance with law. Further avers that it 
is trite law that a deputationist has no vested right to claim to serve in 
the borrowing agency for the entire period of the deputation for 
which he was borrowed.  
5. 
Mr. Imran Khan, learned Assistant Advocate General, raises 
preliminary objection to the maintainability of the present petition on 
the ground that the petitioner is a civil servant and mere fact that he 
was posted on deputation to a Federal Agency neither denudes him 
of his status of civil servant nor he falls within the exclusion 
envisaged under Section 2(1)(b) of the Punjab Civil Servants Act, 
1974 (“the Act, 1974”) and therefore, the present petition is hit by 
bar contained in Article 212 of the Constitution. Adds that reliance 
on Rule 11 of the Rules, 1975 is also misconceived inasmuch as the 
said Rule only extends powers of the Police Department to proceed 
in disciplinary matters to the borrowing agency, which does not serve 
as an embargo on the lending agency to proceed against its employee 
in accordance with law. Elaborating his arguments, learned Law 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.42703/2023 
 
 
4
Officer contends that if the misconduct is committed by a Police 
Officer while serving in the borrowing agency that relates to the 
duties assigned to him as a deputationist, the power vests with the 
borrowing agency to proceed against the deputationist but this does 
not include all types of misconduct, particularly, on account of 
involvement in a criminal matter.  
6. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
7. 
This Court intends to address the question of maintainability in 
the first instance. The question is whether or not the petitioner, who 
is an employee of the Punjab Police, is excluded from the definition 
of the term „civil servant‟ on account of his deputation to an 
instrumentality of the Federal Government i.e., the FIA. The 
definition of „civil servant‟ is given in Section 2(1)(b) of the Act, 
1974, which is reproduced below:  
“(b) “civil servant” means a person who is a member of 
a civil service of the Province or who holds a civil 
post in connection with the affairs of the Province, 
but does not include— 
(i) 
a person who is on deputation to the 
province from the Federation or any 
other Province or Authority;  
(ii) 
a person who is employed on contract, or on 
work-charged basis, or who is paid from 
contingencies; or  
(iii) a person who is a „worker‟ or „workman‟ as 
defined in the Factories Act, 1934 (XXV of 
1934) or the Workmen‟s Compensation Act, 
1923 (VIII of 1923);” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
Perusal of above definition unambiguously reveals that under the 
Act, 1974, a deputationist to the Province of Punjab, from the 
Federation or other Province, does not fall under the purview of a 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.42703/2023 
 
 
5
civil servant for the purposes of applicability of the Act ibid to the 
said deputationist but a civil servant of the Punjab, like the petitioner, 
posted on deputation to the other Province(s) or the Federation or its 
instrumentality, like the FIA, remains a civil servant and the Act, 
1974 is fully applicable to the said person. When confronted with, 
learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon the definition of the 
term „civil servant‟ envisaged in Section 2(1)(b) of the Civil Servants 
Act, 1973 (“the Act, 1973”), applicable to the employees of the 
Federation and submits that the case of the petitioner falls under the 
Act, 1973 and not under the Provincial statute. Section 2(1)(b) of the 
Act, 1973 reads as under:  
“(b) “civil servant” means a person who is a member of 
an All-Pakistan Service or of a civil service of the 
Federation, or who holds a civil post in connection 
with the affairs of the Federation, including any 
such post connected with defence, but does not 
include- 
(i) 
a person who is on deputation to the 
Federation from any Province or other 
authority;  
(ii) 
a person who is employed on contract, or on 
work-charged basis, or who is paid from 
contingencies; or  
(iii) a person who is a “worker” or “workman” as 
defined in the Factories Act, (XXV of 
1934), or the Workman‟s Compensation 
Act, 1923(VIII of 1923);” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
When the facts of the present case are carefully analysed, keeping in 
view the import of Section 2(1)(b)(i) of the Act, 1973, it transpires 
that the petitioner does not fall within the exclusion envisaged under 
the said provision of the Act, 1973, merely, on the ground that he is 
on deputation, from the Province of Punjab, with the instrumentality 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.42703/2023 
 
 
6
of the Federation i.e., FIA. Had any adverse action being initiated by 
the borrowing agency (i.e., FIA), under the Act, 1973, the contention 
of the petitioner would have carried some weight and the case of the 
petitioner would have fallen under Section 2(1)(b)(i) thereof. 
However, it is not the situation in the present case. In-fact, it is the 
repatriation sought by the Punjab Police through the Memorandum 
followed by the Office Order issued by the said department that has 
conferred the cause of action on the petitioner. The borrowing 
agency (i.e., the FIA) has merely actualized the repatriation, sought 
by the lending agency, through its Order dated 19.07.2023 and has 
not acted to the prejudice of the petitioner in any manner whatsoever 
under the Act, 1973 or any other Federal Statute. In the instant case, 
the petitioner seems to be cognizant and well aware of this legal as 
well as factual position, which is evident from the fact that Order 
dated 19.07.2023 issued by the borrowing agency repatriating the 
petitioner has been assailed after filing of the present petition through 
C.M. No.3/2023.  
8. 
Having observed as above, this Court is of the opinion that the 
petitioner is a civil servant and the Act, 1974 is applicable to him. He 
does not fall within the exclusion contained in Section 2(1)(b)(i) of 
the Act, 1973. It hardly needs any judicial reiteration that Article 212 
of the Constitution places absolute and inflexible bar on jurisdiction 
of this Court in matters relating to terms and conditions of the service 
of civil servants, which include appointment, posting, transfer, etc., 
and therefore, this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain a 
constitutional petition. In this regard, this Court is fortified by the 
judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan in case reported as Peer 
Muhammad v. Government of Balochistan through Chief Secretary 
and others (2007 SCMR 54) wherein it has been held that the ouster 
clause embodied in Article 212 is a constitutional command, which 
ousts the jurisdiction of the High Court as well as the Civil Court. 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.42703/2023

While relying on case of Peer Muhammad supra, this Court in case 
reported as Dr. Ghazanffarullah, Medical Superintendent, Tehsil 
Headquarter Hospital, Bhalwal and 2 others. v. Secretary Health, 
Government of the Punjab, Civil Secretariat, Lahore and 6 others 
etc. (PLJ 2011 LAHORE 392) held that Article 212 is a non-
obstante clause and hence, prevails over Article 199 of the 
Constitution. In addition to the pronouncement in case of Peer 
Muhammad supra, the Supreme Court of Pakistan in case reported as 
Ali Azhar Khan Baloch and others v. Province of Sindh and others 
(2015 SCMR 456) has exhaustively defined the jurisdictional 
delineations of the High Court pertaining to the matters of terms and 
conditions of service of the civil servants. In the said judgment, the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan deprecated the exercise of constitutional 
jurisdiction in the matters pertaining to terms and conditions of 
service of civil servants and held that the said exercise is not only in 
defiance of constitutional contours of Article 212 of the Constitution 
but also confronts and defies Article 189 thereof. Case reported as 
National Assembly Secretariat through Secretary v. Manzoor Ahmed 
and others (2015 SCMR 253) is also referred.  
9. 
Having above legal position qua a civil servant belonging to 
Punjab on deputation with a Federal Agency in sight, this Court is of 
the view that there is nothing in the Civil Service Laws to indicate 
that any civil servant, more particularly a Police Officer, working 
under the administrative control of the Government of the Punjab, 
once transferred to Federation or its instrumentality such as the FIA, 
on deputation, will cease to be a civil servant for the purpose of 
initiation of disciplinary proceedings by the Province. Moreover, it is 
also pertinent to mention that Order dated 19.07.2023 issued by the 
FIA is not adverse in any manner whatsoever in relation to the rights 
of the petitioner. At this juncture, it is imperative to note that the 
petitioner being a deputationist has no vested right to claim 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.42703/2023 
 
 
8
continuity for the total period of his deputation for which he was 
borrowed by the FIA. Case reported as Dr. Shafi-ur-Rehman Afridi v. 
C.D.A. Islamabad through Chairman and other (2010 SCMR 378) is 
referred in this regard, wherein it has been held that no deputationist, 
by any stretch of imagination and in absence of any specific 
provision of law, can ask to serve the total period of deputation in the 
borrowing agency. Therefore, the prayer made in the petition seeking 
direction to the FIA to allow the petitioner to serve for the period of 
deputation is not tenable.  
10. 
Similarly, the vehement reliance of the petitioner on Rule 11 
of the Rules, 1975 is also utterly misconceived to contend that it is 
the borrowing agency (i.e., the FIA) only, which is vested with the 
power to initiate disciplinary proceedings. For facility of reference, 
Rule 11 ibid is reproduced as under:  
 
“11. Procedure of Inquiry against Officer lent to other 
Government or Authority.-- (1) Where the services of a 
Police Officer to whom these rules apply are lent to any 
other Government or to a local or other authority, in this 
rule referred to as the borrowing authority, the 
borrowing Authority shall have the powers of the 
authority for the purpose of placing him under 
suspension or requiring him to proceed on leave and 
of initiating proceedings against him under these 
rules. 
(2) 
Provided that the borrowing authority shall 
forthwith inform the authority which has lent his 
services, hereinafter in this rule referred to as the 
lending authority, of the circumstances leading to the 
order of his suspension or the commencement of the 
proceedings, as the case may be.  
(3) 
If, in the light of the findings of the proceedings 
taken against the police officer in terms of sub-rule (1), 
the borrowing authority is of opinion that any minor 
punishment should be imposed on him it shall have the 
powers to impose minor punishment. For major 
punishment  it  shall  transmit to the lending authority the  

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.42703/2023 
 
 
9
 
record of the proceedings and thereupon the lending 
authority shall take action as prescribed in these rules.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
Plain reading of Rule 11 brings forth that the borrowing agency has 
been only delegated and vested with the power of suspension or 
requiring the Police Officer on deputation to proceed on leave and 
initiating proceedings against him under the Rules, 1975, and sub-
Rule (2) thereof obligates the borrowing authority to inform the 
lending authority of any such suspension or proceedings. However, 
this conferment and/or delegation of power by the Rules, 1975, by 
the Police Department to the borrowing agency does not denude the 
former to initiate the disciplinary proceedings against its Officers on 
deputation, if it deems appropriate.  
11. 
Even otherwise, argument of learned Assistant Advocate 
General, Punjab, has force that such powers have been delegated to 
the borrowing agency with respect to any misconduct committed in 
the performance of duties by a Police Officer during the deputation 
period in the borrowing authority and not his conduct outside the 
scope of the duties being performed with the borrowing agency. For 
instance, it covers proceedings on account of absence from the duty 
or failure to obey the orders during the period of deputation etc. 
There might be a situation with the Punjab Police that it discovers 
some misconduct on part of its Officer, while he was working for 
Province of Punjab, after the said officer was deputed to serve the 
Federation and it belies logic that the Punjab Police is not 
empowered, on the basis of Rule 11 of the Rules, 1975, to request the 
repatriation of its Officer in such an eventuality, merely, on account 
of currency of his deputation period with the Federation etc.  
 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.42703/2023

12. 
The matter can be examined from another angle and it would 
be also advantageous to reproduce clause 5.17 of the Standing Order 
No. 13 of 2021 dated 28.08.2021 issued under Article 10(3) of the 
Police Order, 2002 by the Provincial Police Officer, Punjab that 
relates to the period of deputation. Clause 5.17 reads as under: 
“Period of Deputation: The period of deputation shall 
not exceed three years. However, Provincial Police 
Officer reserves the right to withdraw /transfer the 
deputationist at any time without assigning any 
reason. If the request of the borrowing department for 
retention of the deputationist is not acceded to, by the 
competent authority, deputation shall automatically get 
terminated on receipt of refusal by the borrowing 
department and the deputationist shall stand relieved to 
the police department.” 
                                       (Emphasis supplied) 
It is evident that the right to withdraw/transfer the deputationist is 
always retained by the Provincial Police Officer and even the 
borrowing authority cannot refuse repatriation once it receives the 
request of repatriation of Police Officer. Therefore, even if the 
present petition is not hit by bar contained under Article 212 of the 
Constitution, the petitioner as a member of the Punjab Police is 
expected rather obligated to maintain discipline and therefore, cannot 
be allowed to wriggle out of his duty to obey and concede to the 
order of the competent authority seeking his repatriation. If such a 
concession is allowed to the member of the disciplined force like the  
Punjab Police, it will wreak havoc with the discipline, which the 
Police Force is required to maintain, in larger public interest. Suffice 
to observe that in the present case, the borrowing agency has itself 
repatriated the petitioner which is not an adverse order as observed 
earlier, and therefore, the petitioner is left with no choice but to 
report to his parent department.

13. 
Insofar as the reliance placed by learned counsel for the 
petitioner on the case of Habib Bank Limited supra is concerned, the 
same is found to be misconceived. In the said case, the employee was 
terminated from service on account of registration of FIR while 
treating said registration as misconduct. In the instant case, it is not 
an issue at the moment whether the petitioner has been held guilty of 
misconduct or not on account of mere registration of FIR, rather the 
issue involved is to determine as to who has the authority to initiate 
the disciplinary proceedings against the petitioner, which are so far 
not carried out by the Police Department and this Court cannot 
determine factual aspects of an enquiry, which is yet to commence. 
14. 
In view of the above, the petition at hand is devoid of any 
force and hence, dismissed. No order as to cost.
