Ch. Muhammad Iqbal, J:- Through this appeal under 
Section 20 of the Press, Newspapers, News Agencies and Books 
Registration Ordinance 2002, the appellant has challenged the 
validity of order dated 15.02.2012 passed by the District 
Coordination Officer, Chiniot who while invoking jurisdiction 
under Section 19 of the Ordinance ibid, cancelled the declaration 
in respect of Monthly Magazine “Misbah” and the appellant/ 
printer was directed to stop the circulation of the said magazine.

appellant are that the appellant is the publisher of Monthly 
Magazine “Misbah” [hereinafter referred to as the “magazine”] 
published from Chanab Nagar (Rabwah) District Chiniot for the 
female followers of Quadiani group. The original publisher

No.2/D.C.O, Chiniot wherein it was mentioned that the magazine 
contained objectionable material under Section 298-C of the 
Pakistan Penal Code and appellant was further called upon that as 
to why the magazine should not be banned and its declaration be 
cancelled under Section 19 of the Press, Newspapers, News 
Agencies and Books Registration Ordinance 2002. The appellant 
appeared before the respondent No.2 on 06.02.2012 and also got 
recorded his statement regarding compliance of law. On 
15.02.2012, the appellant received an order from the respondent 
No.2 whereby the declaration in respect of the magazine was 
cancelled and order was passed to stop the printing, publication 
and circulation of the said magazine. Hence, this appeal.  
3. 
I have heard learned counsels for the parties and have 
gone through the record. 
4. 
The matter in issue relates to cancellation of declaration of 
press/ publication of a magazine/Misbah. Under Article 19 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
[hereinafter referred to as “Constitution”], every citizen has a 
right of freedom of speech and expression as well as freedom of 
the press but said rights can only be enjoyed subject to the 
conditions imposed in the said Article as well as the law. For 
ready reference, Article 19 of the Constitution is reproduced as 
under: 
 “19. 
Every citizen shall have the right to freedom of speech and 
expression, and there shall be freedom of the press, subject to any 
reasonable restrictions imposed by law in the interest of glory of 
Islam or the integrity, security or defence of Pakistan or any part 
thereof, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency 
or morality, or in relation to contempt of court, commission of or 
incitement to an offence.”  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis supplied)  
As the matter in issue relates to the publication of a magazine 
which publication falls within the domain of “press” and the 
Article ibid while guaranteeing the freedom of press gives 

 
Press Appeal No.225/2012 
 
3
authority to impose restriction in accordance with law. For press 
entities, an Ethical Code of Practice has been given in the 
Schedule of the Press Council of Pakistan Ordinance, 2002, 
which is reproduced as under: 
“Schedule 
(See Section 8 (I) (iv))

The crux of the aforesaid Ethical Code of Practice is that no one 
including “press” is allowed to violate the honor of any 
individual and the state of Pakistan as well as the religion of 
Islam.

Further, Section 5 of the Press, Newspapers, News 
Agencies and Books Registration Ordinance 2002 deals with the 
directions regarding publishing material in the publication 
whereas Section 6 of the Ordinance ibid directs the printer to 
submit declaration with the undertaking to abide by the 
aforementioned Ethical Code of Practice. For ready reference, 
Sections 5 & 6 of the Ordinance ibid are reproduced as under:

The appellant while obtaining the declaration of magazine, 
submitted his affidavit-cum-undertaking to abide by the 
provisions of the Ordinance ibid as well as the Rules and 
Regulations made thereunder but subsequently he has committed 
blatant grave violations to the aforesaid declaration. 
6.  
However, as an abandoned caution, the Chief Minister, 
Punjab constituted Muthida Ulma Board Punjab to ascertain 
regarding preaching of objectionable material. The said Board in 
its meeting held on 27.06.2011 after perusing the contents of the 
magazine, recommended for cancellation of its declaration on the 
ground of publishing objectionable material. For reference, 
relevant portion of the decision dated 27.06.2011 is reproduced as

The aforesaid reply given by the appellant shows that he neither 
controverted the allegations levelled against him nor explained 
about his stance rather made an evasive denial by stating that 
nothing objectionable is being printed in the magazine.  
7. 
 The District Coordination Officer, Chiniot on the basis of 
aforesaid facts of the case and after providing opportunity of 
hearing to the appellant, passed a well-reasoned order dated 
15.02.2012 and the reasons mentioned in the said order could not 
be rebutted by the learned counsel for the appellant. For ready 
reference, order dated 15.02.2012 is reproduced as under:  
“OFFICE OF THE 
DISTRICT COORDINATION OFFICER 
CHINIOT 
 
Subject: 
CANCELLATION 
OF 
DECLARATION 
OF 
 
MONTHLY MISBAH 
 
ORDER 
 
Briefly stating, Mutehida Ulema Board Punjab in 
its meeting held on 27.06.2011 has recommended cancellation of 
declaration 
of 
Monthly 
Magazine 
Misbah 
for 
publishing 
objectionable material. This information was received through letter 
No.SO (IS.III) 6-15/2010, dated 27.10.2011 of Home Department, 
Government of the Punjab. It has also been informed that 
propagation of Qadianiat is a crime Under Section 298-C of PPC. 
The Monthly Misbah has been declared as propagating Qadianiat 
and as such recommended to be banned by Mutahida Ulema Board 
Punjab constituted by the Chief Minister Punjab. Therefore, 
declaration of Monthly Misbah may be cancelled. 
 
In pursuance of the subject matter, the record 
pertaining to Monthly Misbah was obtained from District Jhang as 
the same was not available in this office. Perusal of record reveals 
that the declaration of Monthly Misbah in the name of Sheikh 
Khurshid Ahmad S/o Sheikh Salamat Ali was authenticated by the 
then District Magistrate on 22.09.1986. After going through the 
relevant material received from the Home Department, Government 
of the Punjab, a Notice U/S 19 of Press, Newspapers, News 
Agencies and Books Registration Ordinance, 2002 was issued in the 
name of Tahir Mehdi Imtiaz Ahmad Warraich, the Printer of 
Monthly Misbah Chenab Nagar. It is pertinent to mention here that 
on account of death of Sheikh Khurshid Ahmad in whose name the 
declaration in question was authenticated, the said notice was served 
upon Mr. Tahir Mehdi Imtiaz Ahmad Warraich who is the Printer as 
well as applicant for change of Publisher of Monthly Misbah, 
considering him the concerned party. 

 
Press Appeal No.225/2012 
 
11
 
Mr. Tahir Mehdi Imtiaz Ahmad Warraich appeared 
before the undersigned on 6.2.2012 and his statement was recorded 
accordingly. He has contended that no objectionable material is 
being published in Monthly Misbah. He has further prayed that the 
declaration of Monthly Misbah may not be cancelled. 
 
I have gone through the relevant literature received 
from the Home Department and other material available on record. 
Arguments of Mr. Tahir Mehdi Imtiaz Ahmad Warraich have also 
been heard at length. It is observed as under: 
1) According to Section 6(6) of Press, Newspapers, News 
Agencies and Books Registration Ordinance, 2002, the 
declaration submitted by the publisher under sub-section (5) 
shall be accompanied by an undertaking by the editor to abide 
by the Ethical Code of Practice contained in the schedule to the 
Press Council of Pakistan Ordinance which inter alia lays down:  
“The Press shall avoid originating, printing, publishing 
and disseminating any material, which encourages or 
incites discrimination or hatred on grounds of race, 
religion, caste, sect, nationality, ethnicity, gender, 
disability, illness, or age, of an individual or group”. 
 
2)  The Monthly Misbah contains material which is preaching as 
well as propagation of Qadianiat within the meaning of Section 
289-C of PPC. 
3)  Mr. Tahir Mahdi Imtiaz Ahmad Warraich has failed to prove 
that Misbah does not contain objectionable material.  
4) Mutehida Ulema Board Punjab constituted by the Chief Minister 
Punjab has recommended to ban the Monthly Magazine Misbah. 
 
  
In the light of above mentioned observations, I am 
convinced that Monthly Magazine Misbah is being published in 
contravention of provisions of Press, Newspapers, News Agencies 
and Books Registration Ordinance, 2002. Therefore, I Dr. Irshad 
Ahmed, District Coordination Officer, Chiniot hereby cancel the 
declaration in respect of Monthly Magazine Misbah authenticated 
by the then District Magistrate Jhang with immediate effect. The 
Printer of Monthly Misbah is directed to stop circulation of the 
Monthly Misbah forthwith under intimation to this office. 
 
DISTRICT COORDINATION OFFICER 
CHINIOT” 
Furthermore, under Section 99-A of Criminal Procedure Code 
(Cr.P.C.), 1898, the Government is competent to forfeit any 
publication if it is satisfied that such publication contains 
objectionable material as prescribed in law. For ready reference, 
Section 99-A Cr.P.C. is reproduced as under: 
 “99-A   Power to declare certain publications forfeited and 
to issue search warrants for the same. (1) Where:- 

 
Press Appeal No.225/2012 
 
12
a) Any newspaper, or book as defined in the West 
Pakistan Press and Publication Ordinance, 1963, or any 
other law relating to press and publications for the time 
being in force or 
b) Any document. 
(2) In sub-section (1) “document” includes also any painting, 
drawing or photograph, or otherwise visible representation.” 
8. 
As regard the argument of learned counsel for the 
appellant that the declaration of the magazine has been cancelled 
on the recommendations of Muttehida Ulema Board which has no 
authority in this regard as such the impugned order is not 
sustainable in the eyes of law, suffice it to say in this regard that 
on receipt of the material record/ information the District 
Coordination Officer after application of judicious mind issued 
show cause notice [dated 01.02.2012] to the appellant to appear 
on 06.02.2012 and to explain his position on the allegation 
regarding preaching of Qadianiat through the magazine. In 
response to the said notice, the appellant appeared before the said 
Officer on 06.02.2012 and filed reply [as reproduced in paragraph 
No.5 of this judgment] and the appellant was also heard at full 
length by the DCO before passing the impugned order as 
envisaged in Article 10-A of the Constitution as well as mandated 
by Section 19 of the Press, Newspapers, News Agencies and 
Books Registration Ordinance 2002. Thus, the argument of 
learned counsel for the appellant is devoid of any substance 
which is accordingly hereby repelled.  
9.  
Further, as regard the stance of the appellant that the 
declaration regarding cancellation of the magazine of the 
appellant is result of discrimination, the same is illusive, suffice it 
to say that while scanning contents of the transcripts/publications 
of the Magazine Misbah, Muttehida Ulema Board has found 
objectionable material and even the Home Department has also 
recommended for cancellation of declaration of publications

any specific group. It is apparent from the impugned notification 
that as many as seven publications of different book / magazine 
have been banned which dismantles the very foundation of the 
above argument.  The recommendations dated 27.06.2011 made 
by the Muttehida Ulema Board as well as notification dated 
26.10.2011, issued by the Home Department, reproduced in 
paragraph No.5 of this judgment have not been questioned before 
any competent forum whereas the said recommendations were in 
the active knowledge of the appellant, thus the said 
recommendations of the Home Department have attained finality.  
10.  
As the appellant through publishing the objectionable 
material in magazine in question has committed blatant violation 
of the aforementioned provisions of law as such the District 
Coordination Officer, Chiniot has rightly cancelled the 
declaration of the magazine-Misbah through the well-reasoned 
order dated 15.02.2012 as such the same does not require any 
indulgence from this Court in its appellate jurisdiction. 
11.  
Learned counsel for the appellant has not pointed out any 
illegality, material irregularity or jurisdictional defect in the 
impugned order calling for any interference through this appeal.  
12. 
In view of above, this appeal having no merits is hereby 
dismissed. No order as to costs.
