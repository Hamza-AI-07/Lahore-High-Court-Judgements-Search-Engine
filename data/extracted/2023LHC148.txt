Shahid Karim, J:-. This judgment will decide a number 
of reference applications under Section 133 of the 
Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (“the Ordinance”) as they 
arise out of a common judgment rendered by the 
Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue on 07.01.2013.  The 
formatting has been done in such a manner that the 
questions of law which have been urged to arise out of 
the judgment of the Appellate Tribunal have been 
narrated and the numbers of reference applications in 
which these questions arise have been enumerated 
against the questions in seriatim:       
2. 
Questions Nos.1 & 2: (PTR Nos.173/2013, 
177/2013) 
1. 
Whether 
on 
the 
facts 
and 
in 
the 
circumstances of the case, the hon’ble 
Tribunal was justified to hold that the 
taxation officer was not in possession of 
definite information for invoking provisions 

PTR No.173 of 2013 
2 
 
of 
section 
122(5) 
whereas 
definite 
information pointing out under assessment 
of income was obtained from audit report 
based on audit conducted u/ s 177 in the 
case. 
2. 
Whether 
on 
the 
facts 
and 
in 
the 
circumstances of the case the honourable 
Tribunal was justified to hold that non-
issuance of notice in the prescribed form 
rendered the proceedings void when it has 
been held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court 
that instead of looking into technicalities, 
the court should look into the matter as to 
whether substantial compliance had been 
made and what prejudice was likely to cause 
to the party to whom show cause notice was 
given. 
 
3. 
Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that the 
Appellate Tribunal went wrong in holding that there was no 
definite information before the Taxation Officer on the basis 
of which a notice under Section 122(5) of the Ordinance for 
amendment of the order under Section 122(1) was issued on 
14.06.2004.  By way of historical facts it may be stated that 
the audit was conducted by the Taxation Officer under 
delegated powers by the Commissioner of Income Tax 
Companies Zone-I, Lahore pursuant to which the assessment 
order was passed on 29.06.2004.  An appeal was made to the 
Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) and finally to the 
Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue which has passed the 
impugned judgment on different issues which arose before 
the Tribunal. 
4. 
With regard to the instant questions, the precise 
submission of the learned counsel for the applicant is that 
there was definite information before the Taxation Officer to 
invoke the provisions of section 122(5) of the Ordinance.  
Contrarily, learned counsel for the respondents argued that 

PTR No.173 of 2013 
3 
 
any amendment could have been undertaken by the Taxation 
Officer under powers conferred by sub-section (5A) of 
section 122 and not under sub-section (5) as done in the 
present case.  In order to have a better understanding of the 
respective contentions, sub-section (5) and (5A) are 
reproduced as under: 
“(5) An assessment order in respect of a tax year, or 
an assessment year, shall only be amended under sub-
section (1) and an amended assessment for that year 
shall only be further amended under sub-section (4) 
where, on the basis of “definite information acquired 
from an audit or otherwise”, the Commissioner is 
satisfied that-- 
(i) 
any income chargeable to tax has 
escaped assessment; or 
(ii) 
total income has been under-assessed, or 
assessed at too low a rate, or has been 
the subject of excessive relief or refund; 
or 
(iii) 
any amount under a head of income has 
been mis-classified. 
(5A) Subject to sub-section (9), the Commissioner 
may amend, or further amend, an assessment order, if 
he considers that the assessment order is erroneous in 
so far it is prejudicial to the interest of revenue.” 
5. 
There is no contention that the Taxation Officer issued 
the assessment order by virtue of the powers conferred by 
sub-section (5) of section 122 and did not feel the need to 
invoke the provisions of sub-section (5A) to amend the 
assessment order.  These two provisions, in our opinion, are 
complementary and one does not oust or nullify jurisdiction 
conferred by the other provision.  Both the provisions relate 
to amendment or further amendment of an assessment order.  
Section 122 grants power to the Commissioner to amend an 
assessment order treated as issued under Section 120 by 
making such alteration or addition as the Commissioner 
considers necessary.  By virtue of sub-section (5) such an 

PTR No.173 of 2013 
4 
 
amendment can only be made on the basis of definite 
information acquired from an audit or otherwise.  (Sub-
section (5) was amended by the Finance Act, 2020 but we are 
concerned with the contents of sub-section (5) at the relevant 
time of the passing of the assessment order).  As stated above, 
sub-section (5A) does not negate sub-section (5) in material 
particulars and the only distinction is that the power to amend 
or further amend conferred upon the Commissioner may be 
exercised under distinct circumstances.  The power is 
conditional upon definite information acquired from an audit 
or otherwise as far as sub-section (5) is concerned whereas 
the power to amend or further amend is not dependent upon 
such a pre-condition as envisaged by sub-section (5A).  Since 
the Taxation Officer had conducted an audit, he was of the 
considered opinion that any amendment to be made upon 
consideration of the audit paragraphs could only be done by 
resort to powers conferred by sub-section (5) and not by sub-
section (5A) of Section 122 of the Ordinance.  We do not find 
any irregularity in this course of action taken by the Taxation 
Officer.  The legislature has been very clear and specific in 
delineating the circumstances under which sub-section (5) 
powers can be exercised as also the source of the definite 
information which may either be acquired from an audit or 
otherwise.  Thus, in our opinion, if an audit is conducted and 
discrepancies are noted by the Taxation Officer, this would 
clearly constitute definite information to clothe Taxation 
Officer with the power to amend or further amend the 
assessment order in respect of a tax year.  The Appellate 
Tribunal has relied upon extraneous circumstances to uphold 

PTR No.173 of 2013 
5 
 
the order of the Commissioner (Appeals) in stating that there 
was no definite information with the department for 
amendment of the assessment order.  The reliance on the case 
law noted in the impugned judgment has no relevance to the 
controversy in hand.  It is one thing to hold that there was no 
definite information with the Taxation Officer and another to 
conclude that an audit properly conducted does not constitute 
definite information.  The intention of the legislature has been 
expressed in the words “definite information acquired from 
an audit or otherwise” and no ambiguity can be read into 
these words to hold that there was no definite information 
with the department for completion of assessment. 
6. 
Notwithstanding the above, even if the argument of 
learned counsel for the respondents is to be accepted, the 
assessment order can always be considered as one having 
been passed under sub-section (5A) of section 122.  The only 
condition to be satisfied priorly is that invocation of the 
powers is subject to sub-section (9) which merely provides 
that an amendment or further amendment can only be made if 
a taxpayer has been provided with an opportunity of being 
heard.  A reading of the assessment order passed by the 
Taxation Officer clearly shows that a notice in terms of sub-
section (9) of section 122 was duly issued to the respondents 
and thus we do not harbour any doubt regarding powers of 
Taxation Officer to have passed the assessment order against 
which the appeal arose to the Tribunal. 

PTR No.173 of 2013

7. 
The questions of law in this section are decided in 
favour of the applicant-department and the reference 
applications to this extent are allowed. 
8. 
Question No.3. (P.T.R. Nos.173/2013, 174/2013,  
 
175/2013, 176/2013, 177/2013, 180/2013) 
(i) 
Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, 
the Hon’ble Tribunal was justified to hold that only criteria 
for allowing the taxpayer’s claim for bad debt are the 
prudential regulations of the Sate Bank whereas under the 
Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 section 29 provides the pre-
requisites for declaring any loan or advance as bad debt? 
(ii) 
Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, 
the Hon’ble Tribunal was justified to hold that mere 
provision for non-performing loans in admissible as 
expense from business income, whereas sub-section (1) of 
section 20 of the Ordinance provides that a deduction shall 
be allowed for any expenditure incurred by the person in 
the year? 
(iii) 
Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, 
the Hon’ble Tribunal is justified to hold that provision for 
non-performing loans is admissible for deduction from 
income when its lacking ascertainability and all the events 
in the transaction are not yet occurred as provided u/s 34 
of the Ordinance? 
 
9. 
These questions relate to provision of bad debts which 
have been decided by us in PTR No.184 of 2002 in the 
following terms:- 
“5. 
Thus, the Supreme Court of Pakistan has 
conclusively put construction on the precise scope and 
sweep of section 23(i)(x) of the Ordinance, 1979 and held 
on the basis of the standard accounting principles that a 
debt becomes irrecoverable when it is written off and so the 
entitlement regarding deduction for bad debts was to the 
extent of irrecoverable loans determined as such under the 
regulatory framework governing financial institution.  It 
would thus be a matter to be determined on a case to case 
basis whether the deduction for bad debts was allowable to 
a particular taxpayer / financial institution or not. This 
issue was required to be determined under the repealed 
Ordinance, 1979 by the Deputy Commissioner concerned.  
We, therefore, deem it proper to remit this case for the 
necessary determination regarding irrecoverability of a 
loan to the competent officer concerned under the present 
dispensation.  This will be done by the competent officer in 
the light of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
set out above and to determine whether deduction for bad 
debts was to be allowed to a particular taxpayer 
individually on the basis of the treatment that has been 

PTR No.173 of 2013 
7 
 
given by the taxpayer / financial institution in its books of 
account.” 
 
The counsel for the respondent submits that these 
cases relate to the period after promulgation of the Ordinance, 
2001.  We do not harbour a doubt that this aspect was also 
considered by the Supreme Court of Pakistan and its holding 
on this aspect shall squarely apply (see paragraph 10).  In the 
post-2001 Ordinance cases, the determination is to be made 
by the assesse himself. 
10. 
The questions of law at „3‟ are decided in the same 
terms and the reference applications to this extent are 
disposed of. 
11. 
Question No.4. (P.T.R. Nos.173/2013, 178/2013,   
 
179/2013, 180/2013) 
 
“Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case, the 
Hon’ble Tribunal was justified to allow the provision of 
diminution of value of investment being a notional expense 
and lacking ascertainably as provide u/s 34 of the 
Ordinance?” 
 
 
 
 
 
Question No.5. (P.T.R. No.174/2013) 
“Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, 
the Hon’ble Tribunal has not erred in misreading and non-
reading the evidence on record that out of total claim of 
Rs.15,856,000 only amount of Rs.11,600,000 was added, 
being not taxed earlier.” 
 
The questions of law raised above have been decided 
by this Court in PTR No.79 of 2006 as well as PTR No.529 of 
2012 (CIR v. Allied Bank Ltd.) while deciding questions 
No.ii and iii.  These questions are also decided in terms of the 
cases mentioned above and the impugned order of the 
Appellate Tribunal is upheld.  The questions of law are 
decided against the applicant and in favour of the 
respondents.

12.  Question No.6. (P.T.R. Nos.173/2013, 174/2013, 175/2013, 
176/2013,177/2013,178/2013, 
179/2013, 
180/2013) 
“Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, 
the Hon’ble Tribunal is justified in holding that expenses 
cannot be allocated against exempt income when section 
67 of the Ordinance & Rule 13 of the Rules clearly 
provides that where a taxpayer derives income from more 
than one source for income, expenses against income are 
to be apportioned and allocated against each category of 
income on proportionate bases?” 
 
This question of law has also been decided by this 
Court in PTR Nos.52 to 54 of 2006 (CIT v. Prime 
Commercial Bank) and PTR No.529 of 2012 (CIT v. Allied 
Bank Ltd.) while deciding questions No.viii and ix.  The 
judgment of the Appellate Tribunal is upheld with regard to 
this question and the reference application is dismissed. 
13. 
Question No.7. 
(P.T.R. No.173/2013) 
“Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, 
the Hon’ble Tribunal has not erred in deleting the addition 
made in the hands of the taxpayer bank on account of 
excess amount of perquisites to employees as is provided 
u/s 21(k) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001? 
 
This question of law has also been decided by this 
Court in PTR Nos.52 to 54 of 2006 (CIT v. Prime 
Commercial Bank) and PTR No.529 of 2012 (CIT v. Allied 
Bank Ltd.) while deciding questions No.viii and ix.  The 
judgment of the Appellate Tribunal is upheld with regard to 
this question and the reference application is dismissed. 
14. 
Question No.8. 
(P.T.R. No.173/2013) 
 
“Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, 
the Hon’ble Tribunal was justified to declare that 
Membership fee paid to stock exchange is not in the nature 
of capital whereas the same has been paid in connection 
with the share’s investment of the taxpayer?” 
 
The forums below have rendered a concurrent finding 
of fact and we do not find any question of law to arise out of 
the order of the Appellate Tribunal.  We decline to answer the 

PTR No.173 of 2013 
9 
 
question of law as framed and uphold the findings of the 
Tribunal as well as Commissioner (Appeals). 
15. Question No.9. 
(P.T.R. No.173/2013) 
 
“Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, 
the Hon’ble Tribunal was justified to hold publicity 
expenses for new branches as business promotion expenses 
whereas the expense was made for extension of business, 
was capital in nature?” 
Question No.10. 
(P.T.R. 
No.174/2013, 
175/2013, 
176/2013, 177/2013) 
 
Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, 
the Hon’ble Tribunal was justified in holding renovation 
expenses of lease-hold branches as revenue in nature 
whereas the taxpayer itself, in the depreciation schedule, 
has treated renovation as capital expenses and claimed 
depreciation thereon 
 
These questions have been decided in PTR No.54 of 
2006 (CIT v. Prime Commercial Bank) in the order passed by 
a Division Bench of this Court on 5.12.2022.  These questions 
are also decided in favour of the respondents and against the 
applicant-department.  The judgment of the Appellate 
Tribunal is upheld on these questions. 
16. 
Question No.11. 
(P.T.R. No. 173/2013, 174/2013, 
 
175/2013, 176/2013, 177/2013, 180/2013) 
(i) 
Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, 
the Hon’ble Tribunal was justified to hold that vehicles 
having been given to employees as per terms of 
employment, depreciation could not be curtailed in the 
hands of the company u/s 22(3) of the Ordinance, when the 
vehicles are owned and shown its own assets by the 
company? 
(ii) 
Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, 
the Hon’ble Tribunal was justified in the holding that for 
personal use of vehicles addition could only be made in the 
hands of employees and not in the hands of the taxpayer as 
has been made u/s 21(k) during the year. 
(iii) 
Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, 
the Hon’ble Tribunal was justified to delete addition made 
u/s 20(1) of the Ordinance in the taxpayer’s hands under 
the head traveling & motor vehicles expenses on account of 
expenses of personal/non-business nature in the tax year 
2003. 
 
 
These questions of law have been decided by this 
Court in PTR No.529 of 2012 (CIT v. Allied Bank Ltd.) 

PTR No.173 of 2013 
10 
 
while deciding question No.v.  The issue has been decided in 
favour of the applicant-department and we do not find any 
reason to disagree with the decision made earlier.  The 
reference application as regards this question(s) is allowed. 
17. 
Question No.12. (P.T.R. No.173/2013, 180/2013) 
 
“Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of 
the case, the Hon’ble Tribunal was justified to 
reject finding of the taxation officer that normal life 
of intangible being un-ascertainable was to be 
adopted 10 year which was quite in accordance 
with the provisions of section 24(4) of the 
Ordinance?” 
 
There is a concurrent finding of fact by the Appellate 
Tribunal as well as the Commissioner (Appeals).  The 
learned counsel for the applicant relied upon section 24 (4) 
of the Ordinance to contend that the computer software did 
not have a normal life of ten years and was an intangible 
that does not have an un-ascertainable useful life.  This was 
agreed by the Appellate Tribunal as well as Commissioner 
(Appeals) where it was held as a matter of fact that 
computer software and programs cannot be deemed to have 
a useful life of ten years as technological advances are 
occurring at such a speed that a life of five years could be 
considered as a useful life and not beyond that.  Since the 
Tribunal rendered its findings on the basis of factual 
ascertainment of useful life of computer software, we do not 
find any question of law to arise in this regard and therefore 
decline to answer this question of law. 
18. Question No.13. (P.T.R. No.173/2013, 180/2013) 
(i) 
Whether 
on 
the 
facts 
and 
in 
the 
circumstances of the case, the Hon’ble 
Tribunal was justified to vacate orders u/s 
221 holding that there was no mistake 
apparent from the record whereas the fact of 

PTR No.173 of 2013 
11 
 
taking credit of tax beyond the period of 
relevant tax year was proved from the 
record and it was a mistake floating on the 
surface of the record? 
(ii) 
Whether 
on 
the 
facts 
and 
in 
the 
circumstances of the case, the Hon’ble 
Tribunal was justified to hold that advance 
tax paid beyond the period of relevant tax 
year was adjustable in the said relevant tax 
year if it was paid for said tax year. 
 
 
Once again both the forums below have rendered a 
concurrent finding of fact and upon hearing the parties we 
do not find any reasonable cause to differ with the findings 
of the two forums below.  Learned counsel for the 
applicant relied upon section 147(8) of the Ordinance, 
which reads as under: 
“147(8)  A taxpayer who has paid advance tax 
under this section for a tax year shall be 
allowed a tax credit for that tax in computing 
the tax due by  the taxpayer on the taxable 
income of the taxpayer for that year. 
 
On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents 
has drawn the attention of this Court to Section 4(3)(c) to 
submit that these have to be read together.  It is not in 
dispute that credit is allowed to the respondent-banks but 
the only difference in the respective contentions of the 
counsels is whether it has to be allowed within the tax year 
permissible to the respondent-banks or the normal financial 
year applicable for the purpose of taxation.  This aspect has 
been dealt with in an elaborate and erudite manner firstly 
by the Commissioner (Appeals) and later on endorsed by 
the Tribunal with which we concur and therefore this 
question is decided against the applicant. 
19. Question No.14. 
(P.T.R. No. 174/2013, 
 
176/2013, 177/2013, 178/2013, 179/2013,   
 
180/2013) 

PTR No.173 of 2013 
12 
 
(i) 
Whether 
on 
the 
facts 
and 
in 
the 
circumstances of the case, the Hon’ble 
Tribunal was justified to hold deduction of a 
provision 
from 
business 
income 
as 
permissible whereas u/s 20(1) a deduction 
can be allowed for any expenditure which 
has actually been incurred by the person in 
the year. 
(ii) 
Whether 
on 
the 
facts 
and 
in 
the 
circumstances of the case, the Hon’ble 
Tribunal was justified to hold deduction of a 
provision of liability against business 
income when a provision is based on an 
unascertainable anticipated liability. 
 
The above question(s) of law has been decided by a 
Division Bench of this Court in PTR No.529 of 2012 (CIT 
v. Allied Bank Ltd.) while deciding question No.iv.  This 
question is also decided in terms of the earlier judgment 
relied upon and is decided against the applicant and in 
favour of the respondents. 
20. Question No.15. (P.T.R. No. 174/2013,180/2013) 
(i) 
Whether on the facts and circumstances of 
the case, the Hon’ble Tribunal was justified 
to hold that compensation provided for u/s 
171 is payable from the date of assessment 
order taken to have been mad u/s 120(1) by 
the Commissioner whereas sub-section (2) 
of section 171, for the purpose of 
compensation, provides specified dates 
which does not include the date ordered by 
the Hon’ble Tribunal  
(ii) 
Whether Interpretation of law as made by 
the Hon’ble Tribunal by holding that 
compensation becomes due from the date of 
order u/s 120(1) is not against the well-
established principle of interpretation that 
statutory provisions are to be construed 
together and not to apply one redundancy 
can be attributed to legislature (2005 PTD 
1993(C)-SC). 
 
  
Once again the two forums below have 
rendered a concurrent finding of fact regarding this 
question(s).  The Appellate Tribunal relied upon an 
earlier order passed by the Appellate Tribunal where it 
was held that for the purpose of section 171 of the 

PTR No.173 of 2013 
13 
 
Ordinance, the refund becomes due on the date it was 
treated to have made under Section 120(1).  It may be 
mentioned that the department allowed compensation for 
the period starting from three months after the receipt of 
the appellate order.  It further rejected the claim for the 
period during which the order under Section 120 was 
operative.  In appeal, the Commissioner (Appeals) 
allowed compensation for this year as well against which 
the department filed an appeal before the Appellate 
Tribunal.  Learned counsel for the applicant relied upon a 
judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan reported as 
2021 SCMR 1453.   We do not however find this 
judgment to be relevant for the present question.  The 
department does not dispute that compensation is due on 
account of delayed refund.  The only dispute is regarding 
one of the periods in question for which the 
compensation was denied.  Sub-section (1) of section 171 
is clear and unequivocal.  It obliges the Commissioner to 
pay to the taxpayer a further amount by way of 
compensation where the refund due to a taxpayer has not 
been paid within three months of the date on which it 
becomes due.  Thus, the two forums below were right in 
holding that for the purpose of sub-section (1) of section 
171 of the Ordinance the refund becomes due on the date 
of the assessment order made under Section 120 (1).  The 
question of law is, therefore, decided in favour of the 
respondents. 
21. 
Question No.16. 
(P.T.R. No.174/2013) 

PTR No.173 of 2013 
14 
 
 
Whether on the facts & in the circumstances of the 
case, the Hon’ble Tribunal was justified to hold that 
amount received on account of compensation for 
delayed refund was not taxable despite the fact that 
such income is not exempt under any of the 
provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001. 
This issue has already been resolved by a 
judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan in Sui 
Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd. V. Commissioner Inland 
Revenue Legal Division Large Taxpayer Unit (2021 
SCMR 1453).  It has also been decided by this Court in 
PTR No.196 of 2009 and thus the question of law at 16 
is decided against the respondents and in favour of the 
applicant. 
22. 
Question No.17. 
(P.T.R. 
No. 
175/2013, 
 176/2013, 177/2013) 
(i) 
Whether 
on 
the 
facts 
and 
in 
the 
circumstances of the case, the Hon’ble 
Tribunal is justified in holding that the 
department is bound to follow earlier 
judgments whereas it is a settled principle of 
law that every judgment must be read as 
applicable to the particular facts proved or 
assumed to be proved (1994 SCMR 2213). 
(ii) 
Whether on the facts and circumstances of 
the case, the Hon’ble Tribunal is justified to 
held that section 124A of the Ordinance, is 
mandatory in nature whereas the facts of the 
case relied upon are distinguishable from 
the facts of the case. 
 
  
This question is not required to be answered by 
this Court as during the course of this judgment we 
have decided different issues which arose before the 
Tribunal as also before this Court in these reference 
applications. 
23. 
Question No.18. (P.T.R. No. 175/2013,  
 
  
176/2013) 
(i) 
Whether on the facts and circumstances of 
the case, the Hon’ble Tribunal was justified

of 
securities 
should

facts 
and 
in

circumstances of the case, the Hon’ble 
Tribunal has erred in non-reading and

The above question(s) of law has already been 
decided by this Court in PTR No.529 of 2012 (CIT v. 
Allied Bank Ltd.) while deciding question No.xiv.  This 
question is also decided in terms of the above judgment 
and against the applicant. 
24. 
Question 
No.19. 
(P.T.R. 
No. 
176/2013, 
 178/2013, 179/2013,180/2013) 
(i) 
Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of 
the case, the Hon’ble Tribunal was justified to hold 
that once reversal is reduced from the charge for 
the year, it cannot be taxed again, whereas 
reversal having already availed tax relief is 
chargeable to tax upon its reversal and as regards 
the provision for non-performing advances, the 
same is to be reflected separately as in the tax year 
2009 & 2010 it cannot exceed 1% of the total 
advances as per rule 1(c) of the Seventh Schedule 
to I.T.O 2001. 
(ii) 
Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of 
the case, the Hon’ble Tribunal was justified in 
holding that amount of reversal be allowed to set 
off against the amount of provision charged in the 
year whereas this was tantamount to allowing of 
the provision to that extent in a concealed manner 
beyond 1% of the total advances as under rule 1(c) 
of Seventh Schedule, provision for non-performing 
advances could not be more than 1% of the total 
advances.  
(iii) 
Whether on the facts and circumstances of the 
case, the Hon’ble Tribunal was justified to allow 
provision charged in the year at Rs.1705,486,000 
whereas under rule 1(c) of Seventh Schedule 
admissible amount @ 1% of total advances worked 
out at Rs.720,533,910 only. 
 
Question No.20. (P.T.R. No. 178/2013, 179/2013) 

PTR No.173 of 2013 
16 
 
Whether on the facts & in the circumstances of the 
case, the Hon’ble Tribunal is justified to hold that 
provision for non-performing advances is to be 
worked  out at 1% of gross advances shown in Note 
No.10 to the accounts whereas Rule 1(c) of the 
Seventh Schedule say that provision is to be 
restricted upto 1% of balance sheet total advances.  
 
These questions have been decided by the 
Appellate Tribunal by considering the peculiar facts of 
the case and do not give rise to any question of law to 
be answered by this Court.  We, therefore, decline to 
answer these questions having a factual connotation. 
25. 
Question No.21. (P.T.R. No. 177/2013) 
Whether on the facts & in the circumstances of the 
case, the Hon’ble Tribunal was justified to hold 
that a contract of sale of securities with a 
simultaneous commitment to repurchase the same 
at a specified date and price, amounts to “loan 
agreement” whereas the said transaction contains 
all the ingredients of a sale transaction and of a 
purchase transaction and profit arising there from 
is taxable. 
 
This question of law relates to transactions 
which the banking companies (respondents) entered 
into in order to raise liquidity and is called Repurchase 
Agreement, commonly known as Repo (“The 
Agreement).  The Commissioner (Appeals) confirmed 
the addition while making observations that the 
agreement was not a loan agreement but a sale / 
purchase agreement and thus not covered by the 
mischief of Section 151(1)(d) of the Ordinance.  In our 
opinion the Appellate Tribunal has rightly held that the 
repurchase agreement could only be characterized as a 
loan agreement.  While relying upon the book 
published by SBP in collaboration with Institute of 
Banks Pakistan and other institutions, came to the 

PTR No.173 of 2013 
17 
 
conclusion that the agreement was indeed a loan 
agreement to be caught by the exception given in 
section 151 (1)(d).  There is no justification for 
holding such an agreement to be a sale and purchase 
agreement for it has all the trappings of a loan 
agreement and is a technique used by the banking 
companies to raise short term liquidity either from 
SBP or from the money market.  Section 151(1)(d) 
provides that: 
“151(1)(d)  a banking company, a financial 
institution, a company referred to in [sub-
clauses (i) and (ii) of clause (b)] of sub-section 
(2) of section 80, or a finance society pays any 
profit on any bond, certificate, debenture, 
security or instrument of any kind (other than a 
loan agreement between a borrower and a 
banking company or a development finance 
institution) to any person other than financial 
institution.” 
 
The respondents seek benefit of the words 
which have been mentioned in brackets in clause (d) of 
sub-section (1) of section 151 viz. “other than a loan 
agreement between a borrower and a banking 
company or a development finance institution”.  
Otherwise, the respondents were obliged under Section 
151 to deduct tax at the rate specified in 1A of Part III 
of the 1st Schedule from the gross amount of the yield.  
The respondents did not do so on the plea that there 
was a loan agreement between the respondents and 
either a banking company or a development financial 
institution.  The term „banking company‟ has been 
defined in the Ordinance as under: 

PTR No.173 of 2013 
18 
 
“banking company‖ means a banking company 
as 
defined 
in 
the 
Banking 
Companies 
Ordinance, 1962 (LVII of 1962) and includes 
any body corporate which transacts the 
business of banking in Pakistan;” 
 
Therefore, by the definition, a banking company 
is the one as defined in the Banking Companies 
Ordinance, 1962 and includes any body corporate 
which transacts the business of banking in Pakistan.  
The further question which ought to have engaged and 
determined by the Appellate Tribunal was whether the 
loan agreement was between the respondents and a 
banking 
company 
or 
a 
development 
financial 
institution.  Clearly, in case the loan agreement was 
with State Bank of Pakistan, it is not covered by the 
exclusion of clause (d) of sub-section (1) of section 
151 as SBP is not a banking company or a 
development financial institution by any stretch of 
imagination nor by the definition of the term „banking 
company‟ as given in the Ordinance, 1962.  This 
factual aspect was not determined by the three forums 
below and for the purpose the matter will have to be 
referred back to the Taxation Officer to determine 
precisely the nature and sweep of the loan agreement 
only to the extent whether it had been executed with a 
banking 
company 
or 
a 
development 
financial 
institution as defined in the Ordinance.  If this is not 
the case, the respondents are not entitled to the 
exception given in clause (d) of sub-section (1) of 
section 151.  We, therefore, remand the matter to 
conduct this inquiry to the Taxation Officer (or any 

PTR No.173 of 2013 
19 
 
other relevant officer empowered to do so under the 
law).  The question of law is answered accordingly.  
 
26. 
 Question No.22. (P.T.R. No. 178/2013) 
(i) 
Whether 
on 
the 
facts 
and 
in 
the 
circumstances of the case, the Hon’ble 
Tribunal has erred in non-reading and 
misreading the evidence on record in 
allowing the appeal because as pointed out 
in Para 7.3 of the assessment order, the 
taxpayer did not get permission of the 
competent authority while making the 
contributions as was required under the law 
and Rules and such contributions were not 
eligible for deduction. 
(ii) 
Whether 
on 
the 
facts 
and 
in 
the 
circumstances of the case, the Hon’ble 
Tribunal 
was 
justified 
to 
allow 
the 
contribution made to the gratuity fund as 
deduction, when the claim was not based on 
an ascertained liability as per provision of 
section 34 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 
2001. 
 
 
This question (s) of law also entails a factual 
controversy which has been decided by the Appellate 
Tribunal.  Moreover, an approval letter was provided 
to Taxation Officer to show that contribution was 
made in an approved fund.  The question of law is 
decided against the applicant department. 
27. 
Question No.23. (P.T.R. No. 178/2013, 179/2013) 
Whether on the facts & circumstances of the case, 
the Hon’ble Tribunal was justified in holding that 
after insertion of section 100A & Seventh 
Schedule, the tax authorities could not re-compute 
income of the banks despite the fact that the 
Schedule envisages computation of income of 
banks according to provisions of the schedule as 
well as provisions of Income Tax Ordinance not 
mentioned in the said schedule. 
 
This question of law has been decided by a 
Division Bench of this Court in PTR No.529 of 2012 
(CIT v. Allied Bank Ltd.) while deciding question 

PTR No.173 of 2013 
20 
 
No.x.  Thus, the question of law is decided against the 
applicant department and the order of the Tribunal is 
upheld. 
28. 
Question No.24. (P.T.R. No. 178/2013, 179/2013) 
Whether on the facts & circumstances of the case, 
the Hon’ble Tribunal is justified to delete WWF 
being illegal, ignoring the judgment of Honorable 
Sindh High Court dated 01.03.2013 in CP No.D-
2753 of 2009 wherein it has been held that WWF is 
a tax and the amendments introduced in the WWF 
Ordinance, 1971 through Finance Act, 2006 and 
2008 respectively (Money Bills) do not suffer from 
any constitutional or legal infirmity. 
 
This question of law has already been decided 
by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in Workers Welfare 
Funds v. East Pakistan Chrome Tannery (Pvt.) Ltd. 
[(2016) 114 Tax 385] in favour of the respondent-
assessee and against the applicant department.  The 
question of law is decided in terms of the judgment of 
the Supreme Court of Pakistan. 
29. 
In view of the above, these reference 
applications are disposed of in the above terms. 
 
A copy of this order shall be sent to the 
Tribunal under the Seal of the Court.
