Ms. Shaista Altaf, Advocate. 
 
 
This petition in the form of civil revision questions 
the vires of order dated 4th September, 2020, whereby 
learned Additional District Judge, Fatehjang District Attock, 
while dismissing the appeal in limine preferred by the 
petitioner, affirmed the order and decree dated 12th October, 
2019 passed by learned Civil Judge Class-II, Fatehjang 
(Attock). 
2. 
Succinctly the facts necessary for adjudication of 
instant petition are that the petitioner instituted a suit for 
possession through pre-emption, averring therein that suit 
land was purchased by the respondent through mutation 
No.2729 dated 22nd December, 2015 in lieu sale 
consideration of Rs.9,00,000/-. As per averments contained 
in the plaint, the petitioner attained the knowledge of sale on 
29th September, 2016 at 11:00 am through Mairaj-ud-Din 
when he was present in his regional office situated near 
Motorway Chowk Chungi No.26 Grand Trunk (G.T.) Road, 
Islamabad in presence of Anjum Akhtar, Muhammad Afzal 
and Naveed Akhtar Qayyum. It is the case of the petitioner 
that immediately on attaining the knowledge, he performed 
necessary Talbs in furtherance of his superior right of pre-
emption. The respondent, while resisting the suit moved an 
application under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil 

Civil Revision No.212-D of 2021 
 
~2~ 
 
Procedure (V of 1908) (hereinafter referred to as “C.P.C.”) 
seeking rejection of plaint on the ground that it is barred by 
time. The application was though resisted by the petitioner 
through a written reply but same was allowed and plaint was 
rejected by way of order and decree dated 12th October, 
2019. The petitioner, feeling dissatisfied from the rejection 
of plaint preferred an appeal under Section 96 of the C.P.C. 
before learned Additional District Judge, Fatehjang District 
Attock. The appeal was dismissed by way of impugned 
order dated 4th September, 2020, hence this petition under 
Section 115 of the C.P.C. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner, while referring to 
Section 31 of the Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1991 submitted 
that no public notice was issued with regard to attestation of 
mutation as is required under the law. She added that 
limitation for filing a suit for pre-emption in such a case 
would start from the date of knowledge of the pre-emptor. 
While placing reliance on AMIR versus FALAK SHER and 
another (2003 CLC 1756) and MUHAMMAD KHAN versus 
MUHAMMAD HUSSAIN and 2 others (2002 YLR 1353), learned 
counsel contended that rejection of plaint was highly 
unwarranted and concurrent findings are thus not tenable. 
4. 
Heard. Record perused. 
5. 
Since petitioner is non-suited on the ground of 
limitation, so instead of delving into rigmarole of facts it 
would be apt to directly advert to the core issue. Section 30 
of the Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1991 (hereinafter referred to 
as “Act, 1991”) prescribes the period of limitation for a suit 
to enforce the right of pre-emption, which reads as under :- 
“30. 
Limitation.—The period of limitation for a suit to 
enforce a right of pre-emption under this Act shall be four 
months from the date: 
(a) 
of the registration of the sale-deed; 
(b) 
of the attestation of the mutation, if the sale is made 
otherwise than through a registered sale-deed; 

Civil Revision No.212-D of 2021 
 
~3~ 
 
(c) 
on which the vendee takes physical possession of the 
property if the sale is made otherwise than through a 
registered sale-deed or a mutation; or 
(d) 
of knowledge by the pre-emptor, if the sale is not 
covered under paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) or 
paragraph (c).” 
(Underlining supplied for emphasis) 
It is manifestly clear from the above that in case a sale is 
made through mutation the limitation will be counted from 
the date of attestation of mutation and the pre-emptor is 
bound to bring his suit within four months from such date. 
6. 
While adverting to the contention of learned counsel 
for the petitioner that no notice under Section 31 of the Act, 
1991 was since given at the time of attestation of mutation, 
so limitation would start running from date of knowledge; it 
is observed that from the plain reading of Section 30(b) of 
the Act, 1991 it clearly manifest that in case of sale through 
mutation, the limitation would start running from the date of 
attestation of mutation. Subsection (d) clearly envisages that 
limitation for instituting a suit for pre-emption would 
commence from the date of knowledge by the pre-emptor 
only in cases not covered under preceding paragraphs. 
7. 
So far scope and extent of Section 31 of the Act, 1991 
is concerned, it is noticed that it exclusively deals with the 
issuance of public notice by the officer registering the sale 
deed or attesting the mutation of a sale within two weeks of 
registration or attestation as the case may be whereas 
limitation for instituting a suit for pre-emption is to be 
regulated by Section 30 of the Act, 1991. From the bare 
perusal of both the provisions it can be observed with naked 
eyes that both these provisions deal with two entirely 
different situations. I feel no hesitation to observe that 
Sections 30 & 31 of the Act, 1991 are neither having any 
nexus nor dependent on each other rather both are 
independent having no effect or impact on each other. Thus 
even in case of non-issuance of notice in terms of Section 31 

Civil Revision No.212-D of 2021 
 
~4~ 
 
of the Act, 1991 there would be no adverse effect on the 
provision of Section 30 regulating the limitation for 
instituting a suit for pre-emption. Guidance in this respect 
can be sought from 
Mst. 
KAUSAR 
PARVEEN 
versus 
MUHAMMAD IQBAL (PLD 2012 Supreme Court 760). The 
relevant extract from the same is reproduced below :- 
“4. We have examined both the judgments and have also 
applied our mind to the provisions of sections 30 and 31 of the 
Act. In our candid view, both these sections are independent of 
each other having no effect and impact on each other. Though 
it is mandated by section 31 of the Act that a public notice be 
issued in terms thereof, but by no stretch of interpretation this 
provision (Section 31) can be held to regulate and control the 
period of limitation prescribed by Section 30, which section in 
clear and unequivocal terms prescribes "the period of 
limitation for a suit to enforce a right of preemption under 
this Act shall be four months from the date--(a) of the 
registration of the sale-deed". If the intention of the legislature 
was to make the above period of limitation subject and 
subservient to the requirement of section 31, the legislature 
would have clearly indicated its intention by the use of 
appropriate expression and/or words in either of the two 
sections, such as, that subject to the issuance of a notice under 
section 31 the period of limitation shall be four months in the 
cases covered by subsections (a) and (b) of section 30. But, this 
is not so and, therefore, we cannot read into section 30 by 
implication or on the basis of any other rule of interpretation 
the provisions of section 31 and the requirement of notice as a 
condition precedent for computing the period of limitation and 
to hold that if the absence thereof (the notice), the date of 
knowledge shall be the starting point of four months limitation.  
5. As regards the question about the effect and interaction of 
section 30(d) and the preceding clauses (a)(b)(c) thereto, it may 
be held that section 30 has four parts/components, each of 
which is a separate and independent provision in its self 
contemplating different eventualities for the purpose of 
limitation of four months, the language in this context of all the 
clauses of the section are clear and unambiguous, section 30(d) 
is not an exception to clauses (a) to (d), rather it is a residual 
provision and would only come into play if none of the 
preceding clauses are applicable/attracted. But, where a case is 
covered by any specific earlier clause, clause (d) cannot be 
resorted to. In view of the above, this appeal has no merit and 
is accordingly dismissed.” 
8. 
In the case of QASIM ALI versus REHMATULLAH (2005 
SCMR 1926) the Supreme Court of Pakistan while 
interpreting Sections 30 & 31 of the Act, 1991 held as 
under:- 
“4. We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner at 
length. The provisions of section 30 of the Act read as under:-- 

Civil Revision No.212-D of 2021 
 
~5~ 
 
"30. Limitation. The period of limitation for a suit to enforce a 
right of pre-emption under this Act shall be four months from 
the date:--- 
(a) of the registration of the sale deed; 
(b) of the attestation of the mutation, if the sale is made 
otherwise than through a registered sale deed; 
(c) on which the vendee takes physical possession of the 
property if the sale is made otherwise than through a 
registered sale deed or a mutation; or 
(d) of knowledge by the pre-emptor, if the sale is not covered 
under paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) or paragraph (c)". 
It would thus, appear that in the present case, paragraph (a) of 
section 30 of the Act was attracted and the date of the 
registered sale-deed was terminus a quo for computing the 
limitation period. The other paragraphs of section 30 (ibid) 
would have no application. Moreover, the provisions of section 
30 operate proprio vigore and are independent of section 31 of 
the Act. The period of limitation for filing the pre-emption 
suits is governed by section 30 and not by section 31 of the 
Act. Even otherwise the official acts by the public authorities 
are presumed to have been regularly performed. In the case of 
Muhammad Ramzan v. Lal Khan 1995 SCMR 1510, involving 
the sale through a mutation the pre-emptor was deemed to have 
acquired the knowledge of attestation of mutation of sale 
within two weeks thereof. The impugned judgment does not 
suffer from any legal infirmity so as to call for interference by 
this Court. This is not a fit case for grant of leave to appeal.” 
Reference to the above effect can also be made to Mian ASIF 
ISLAM versus Mian MUHAMMAD ASIF and others (PLD 2001 
Supreme Court 499). 
9. 
Needless to mention that as compared to the Act, 
1991 almost similar provisions in the form of Sections 31 & 
32 are available in the Khyber Pakhtunkhawa Pre-emption 
Act, 1987. In the case of Civil Petitions Nos.642 and 643 of 2012 
In KHIZAR HAYAT versus In C.P. No.642/2012: SARD ALI KHAN, 
ETC. In C.P. No.643/2012: BADSHAH KHAN (NLR 2013 Civil 459), 
while interpreting Section 31 & 32 of the Khyber 
Pakhtunkhawa Pre-emption Act, 1987 the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan held as under :- 
“4…….The case of Maulana Nur-ul-Haq (supra) was squarely 
based upon the provisions of sections 31 and 32 of the  
N-W.F.P Pre-emption Act, 1987 and the argument advanced by 
the learned counsel for the petitioner in that case was identical 
to the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner put 
forward in the present case. It had been held by this Court in 
the said case as follows: 
“7. 
The next point for determination relates to the 
date from which the period of limitation for a suit to 
enforce a right of preemption arising from a registered 
sale deed is to be computed. The explicit and 

Civil Revision No.212-D of 2021 
 
~6~ 
 
mandatory provisions of section 31 of the Act leave no 
room for doubt that in case of a sale effected through a 
registered sale-deed the period of one hundred and 
twenty days shall be computed from the date of 
registration of the sale-deed. The contention that if the 
Registrar falls to issue public notice envisaged by the 
mandatory provisions of section 32 of the Act the 
period of limitation is to be computed from the date of 
knowledge by the pre-emptor is misconceived. Such a 
provision is neither contained in section 31 of the Act 
nor can be read into it in view of settled law that Court 
cannot supply ‘casus omissus’………..” 
After having gone through the principles laid down in the 
judgments supra, no cavil left that period of limitation 
would be computed keeping in view of mandate of Section 
30 of the Act, 1991 which clearly provides four months for 
the institution of the suit from the date of attestation of 
mutation and not from the date of knowledge alleged in the 
plaint.  
10. 
So far judgments relied upon by learned counsel for 
the petitioner are concerned, it is observed that in view of 
law laid down by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the cases 
referred hereinabove, there would remain no binding force 
in the judgments referred by learned counsel for the 
petitioners as in terms of Article 189 of the Constitution of 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 when judgment of 
the Supreme Court of Pakistan decides a question of law or 
is based upon or enunciates a principles of law, be binding 
on all other courts in Pakistan. 
11. 
Before moving further, it is necessary to mention here 
that mutation in question even otherwise was quoted as 
exchange but the petitioner while disputing its nature termed 
it as sale mutation but in view of hurdle of limitation in the 
way of petitioner there is no need to discuss this aspect of 
the matter. Admittedly mutation in question was attested on 
22nd December, 2015 in favour of respondent. The 
petitioner, while asserting his superior right of pre-emption 
instituted the suit on 15th October, 2016 which was clearly 
beyond the prescribed period of time. Section 3 of the 

Civil Revision No.212-D of 2021 
 
~7~ 
 
Limitation Act 1908 casts a duty upon the court to examine 
in the first instance as to whether proceedings brought 
before it are within time or otherwise, irrespective of the fact 
that any of the parties to the lis have raised such question or 
not. 
12. 
There are concurrent findings of the two courts of 
competent jurisdiction which are apparently founded on the 
well settled principles of law. The scope of revisional 
jurisdiction is circumscribed to the eventualities mentioned 
in Section 115 of the C.P.C. The revisional powers are 
limited and can only be exercised when the petitioner(s) 
succeed(s) in establishing that the impugned order or 
judgment suffers legal infirmities, hedged in Section 115 of 
Code supra. The revisional jurisdiction can only be invoked, 
if some patent illegality is floating on the surface of record. 
No jurisdictional defect or material irregularity is pointed 
out by the petitioner in the order and judgment under 
challenge, therefore, I am of the considered view that the 
instant petition having no merits is dismissed in limine.
