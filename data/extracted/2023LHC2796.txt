Muhammad Salman Ullah Khan, Advocates. 
For Respondents No.1 & 2:

Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – This petition under Article 199 of 
the 
Constitution 
of 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Pakistan, 
1973  
(the “Constitution”), is directed against the concurrent orders passed by the 
Syndicate of the University of Sargodha (the “University”) and the 
Ombudsperson Punjab imposing the major penalty of removal from service 
on the Petitioner. 
The facts 
2. 
 
The University initially hired the Petitioner as an Assistant 
Professor of Mathematics (BS-19) on a contract basis. It regularized his 
services on 15.7.2015. The Petitioner was working as Head of the 
Department of Mathematics at the University’s Bhakkar sub-campus when 
it removed him from service. 
3. 
 
On 13.2.2019, Respondent No.6, a female student of the  
B.S. Mathematics programme at the University’s Bhakkar sub-campus, 
posted a video on social media alleging that the Petitioner had harassed her 
for 1½ years. She accused him of sending her obscene videos and text 
messages and making unwanted advances. He threatened to ruin her

academic career when she rebuked him. Respondent No.5, the father of 
Respondent No.6, also lodged FIR No. 64/2019 dated 13.2.2019 with 
Police Station City Bhakkar against the Petitioner in this matter. The 
Additional Sessions Judge granted him pre-arrest bail on 3.4.2019. 
4. 
 
On 15.2.2019, the Deputy Commissioner, Bhakkar, asked the 
University to initiate proceedings against the Petitioner under the 
Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act, 2010  
(the “Act”), as well. In pursuance thereof, the Director of the Bhakkar  
sub-campus contacted Respondent No.6 who submitted a written complaint 
with him on 18.2.2019. He referred that complaint to the Sexual 
Harassment Committee 
(the 
“Inquiry Committee”), and 
on its 
recommendation, the Vice Chancellor suspended the Petitioner vide Office 
Order dated 25.2.2019. Besides, the Vice Chancellor approved the 
migration of Respondent No.6 to the University’s Mianwali sub-campus. 
5. 
 
The Inquiry Committee thoroughly investigated the complaint 
of Respondent No.6. It also obtained complete call data record of the 
Petitioner and Respondent No.6 and forensic reports of their cell phones. 
The Committee concluded that the Petitioner had engaged in sexual 
harassment, but Respondent No.6 was also not blameless. She got involved 
with him purposefully to get favours and afterwards turned to social media 
to bash him. She and her family tried to pressurize the Committee members 
during the proceedings. Therefore, the Inquiry Committee recommended 
the major penalty of removal of service for the Petitioner and disciplinary 
action against Respondent No.6 for violating the student code of conduct. 
6. 
 
The Inquiry Committee’s report was placed before the 
University’s Syndicate during its meeting on 1.8.2019. The Syndicate 
imposed the penalty of removal from service on the Petitioner under sub-
section (4)(ii)(c) of section 4 of the Act. Consequent thereupon, Office 
Order No. SU/VC/2785 dated 8.8.2019 was issued. The Petitioner filed an 
appeal with the Ombudsperson Punjab under section 6 of the Act, which 
was dismissed on 8.11.2019. He filed a representation against it before the 
Governor of the Punjab, who dismissed it by order dated 20.12.2019, 
holding that no such representation lies against the order of the 
Ombudsperson passed in appeal proceedings. One may only challenge the 
Ombudsperson’s order under section 8(5) before the Governor under 

Writ Petition No. 7682/2020 
 
- 3 - 
section 9 of the Act. The Petitioner then sought review before the 
Governor, which was also dismissed on the ground of maintainability vide 
order dated 8.1.2020. He has now filed this constitutional petition. 
7. 
 
The Petitioner was indicted in FIR No. 64/2019. On 2.6.2021, 
the Judicial Magistrate recorded the evidence of Respondent No.5 
(complainant of the FIR) and Respondent No.6 as PW-1 and PW-2, 
respectively. Respondent No.5 stated he was “satisfied with the Petitioner’s 
innocence.” Neither had he extended life threats to his daughter 
(Respondent No.6) nor prepared any video, and he had no objection if he 
was acquitted. Respondent No.6 made a similar statement. The prosecutor 
requested the court to let him cross-examine both of them because they had 
turned hostile. The Judicial Magistrate permitted him, but it was in vain. 
The Petitioner then moved an application under section 249-A Cr.P.C. for 
his acquittal. The Judicial Magistrate accepted it by order dated 2.6.2021, 
stating it was a case of no evidence. 
The submissions 
8. 
 
Hafiz Tariq Nasim, Advocate, contends that Respondent No.6 
plotted against the Petitioner for ulterior objectives. The fact that she filed 
the complaint with an unexplained delay of 1½ years casts doubt on the 
veracity of her allegation. He next contends that Respondent No.6, being a 
student of the University, does not fall within the definition of “employee” 
given in section 2(f) of the Act. As such, the proceedings against the 
Petitioner are coram non judice. Hafiz Nasim further contends that the 
Inquiry Committee did not conduct the inquiry in accordance with the law, 
which has seriously violated the Petitioner’s rights under Articles 4 and  
10-A of the Constitution. He maintains that the Committee did not hold a 
regular inquiry and instead relied on a questionnaire handed to him on 
19.2.2019. It did not even afford him an opportunity to cross-examine 
Respondent No.6, which was mandatory under section 4(1)(c) of the Act. 
Resultantly, the Petitioner has been condemned as a sexual offender in the 
eyes of the public for the rest of his life without a fair chance to defend 
himself. Hafiz Nasim argues that neither the University’s Syndicate nor the 
Ombudsperson has considered that Respondents No.5 & 6 exonerated the 
Petitioner before the Judicial Magistrate and that he has acquitted him in 

Writ Petition No. 7682/2020 
 
- 4 - 
case FIR No. 64/2019. In any event, the penalty imposed on the Petitioner 
is excessive and disproportionate to the alleged offence. 
9. 
 
Mr Sittar Sahil, Assistant Advocate General, contends that the 
Petitioner’s challenge to the applicability of the Act is unfounded and 
based on an incorrect interpretation of the law. According to him, students 
at universities and educational institutions who are victims of sexual 
harassment also have legal remedies under the Act. He has cited the 
following cases to support his argument: Protection Against Harassment 
of Women at Workplace, Islamabad (in the matter of Appeal 
No.1(20)/FOS of 2011) (2013 MLD 225), Fahad Faruqui v. SZABIST 
through President, and another (2019 PCr.LJ 806) and Asif Saleem v. 
Chairman Board of Governors, University of Lahore, and others  
(PLD 2019 Lahore 407). The Assistant Advocate General further contends 
that the Inquiry Committee gave the Petitioner a fair opportunity to defend 
himself. The messages exchanged between him and Respondent No.6 on 
their cell phones and WhatsApp, which forensic analysis has verified, 
corroborate the allegation against him. The Committee confronted the 
Petitioner with the aforementioned texts and forensic reports, but he could 
not refute them. The Inquiry Committee found him guilty after due process, 
and any irregularities in the procedure had not prejudiced him and would 
not vitiate the proceedings. 
10. 
 
Advocate Shan Saeed Ghuman, the counsel for the University 
(Respondents No.1 and 2), has adopted the Assistant Advocate General’s 
arguments. However, he adds that in harassment cases, the offender 
frequently escapes punishment because women, particularly female 
students, keep silent and do not raise their voices due to the threat to their 
reputation and, in the case of students, the risk of academic loss. In the 
present case, Respondent No.6 uploaded a video exposing the Petitioner’s 
wrongdoing, and the University took him to task. The Petitioner 
traumatized Respondent No.6 and disgraced the sacred relationship 
between a teacher and a student. His offence was established during the 
inquiry. Mr Ghuman contends that the legal actions brought under the Act 
are distinct from those under the Pakistan Penal Code for which FIR 
No.64/2019 was registered. The Judicial Magistrate’s order of acquittal 
dated 2.6.2021 has no bearing on the present case. 

Writ Petition No. 7682/2020

11. 
 
Mr Muhammad Afzal Ansari, Advocate, claims that the 
Petitioner pressurized Respondents No.5 & 6 to abandon the criminal case 
against him due to which they exonerated him before the Judicial 
Magistrate on 2.6.2021. However, they subsequently filed an appeal 
against the acquittal order that is still pending. 
Determination 
12. 
 
Kofi Annan says: “Violence against women is perhaps the 
most shameful human rights violation, and it is perhaps the most pervasive. 
It knows no boundaries of geography, culture or wealth. As long as it 
continues, we cannot claim to be making real progress towards equality, 
development and peace.” Ban Ki-moon states: “There is one universal 
truth, applicable to all countries, cultures and communities: violence 
against women is never acceptable, never excusable, never tolerable.” 
13. 
 
Article 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
(UDHR) declares the right to work and favourable work conditions as a 
human right. Article 31 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights says that 
every worker has the right to work in safe, healthy, and dignified 
conditions. Article 11 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) (1979) specifically requires 
the States to ensure that women have equal work opportunities and safe 
working conditions. Other international instruments relevant to the 
discourse include (i) the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence 
Against Women (1993); (ii) the United Nations Fourth World Conference 
on Women (Beijing, 1995); (iii) ILO Discrimination (Employment and 
Occupation) Convention 1958 (No.111); (iv) Indigenous and Tribal 
Peoples Convention 1989 (No.169); (v) ILO Convention No. 190 and 
Recommendation No.206.1  
14. 
 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan has held that the right to 
gender equality and a safe work environment is guaranteed as a 
fundamental right under Articles 9, 14, 18 & 25 of our Constitution of 
1973.2  
                                          
1 These are the first international labour standards to provide a common framework to prevent, remedy 
and eliminate violence and harassment in the world of work, including gender-based violence and 
harassment.

Writ Petition No. 7682/2020

15. 
 
Pakistan’s 
Parliament 
enacted 
the 
Protection 
against 
Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act, 2010 – published in the 
official Gazette on 11.3.2010. In Uzma Naveed Chaudhary and others v. 
Federation of Pakistan and others (PLD 2022 SC 783), the Supreme 
Court observed that the objective of the Act is to actualize the women’s 
freedom to choose a profession or occupation in which they are treated as 
equals with dignity and honour, and where they can feel safe that their 
working environment is free of harassment, abuse and intimidation. The 
Act gives effect to Article 34 of our Constitution’s Principles of Policy, 
which provides that “steps shall be taken to ensure full participation of 
women in all spheres of national life.” The Act also helps Pakistan fulfil its 
international obligations under the treaties and conventions it has ratified. 
16. 
 
The Act stated in section 1(2) that it applied to the entire 
country. Following the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution, on 
5.1.2013, the Punjab Assembly passed the Punjab Protection Against 
Harassment of Women at Workplace (Amendment) Act, 2012  
(III of 2013). Several changes have been made over the years to make it 
more effective. 
17. 
 
Section 2(h) of the Act defines “harassment”. At the time 
relevant to the decision of the present case, it read as follows: 
(h) 
“harassment” means any unwelcome sexual advance, request for 
sexual favours or other verbal or written communication or 
physical conduct of a sexual nature or sexually demeaning 
attitudes, causing interference with work performance or creating 
an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, or the 
attempt to punish the complainant for refusal to comply to such a 
request or is made a condition for employment. 
18. 
 
Section 11 of the Act requires employers to make the “Code of 
Conduct” stipulated in the Schedule to the Act a part of their management 
policy. The Explanation to clause (ii) of the said Code of Conduct 
elucidates that the following are three significant manifestations of 
harassment in the work environment: 
 
 

Writ Petition No. 7682/2020 
 
- 7 - 
(a) 
Abuse of authority.– A demand by a person in authority, such as 
a supervisor, for sexual favours in order for the complainant to 
keep or obtain certain job benefits, be it a wage increase, a 
promotion, training opportunity, a transfer or the job itself. 
(b) 
Creating a hostile environment.– Any unwelcome sexual 
advance, request for sexual favours or other verbal or physical 
conduct of a sexual nature which interferes with an individual’s 
work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, abusive or 
offensive work environment. 
The typical “hostile environment” claim, in general, requires 
finding a pattern of offensive conduct. However, in cases where 
the harassment is particularly severe, such as in cases involving 
physical contact, a single offensive incident will constitute a 
violation. 
(c) 
Retaliation.– The refusal to grant a sexual favour can result in 
retaliation, which may include limiting the employee’s options 
for future promotions or training, distorting the evaluation 
reports, generating gossip against the employee or other ways of 
limiting access to his/her rights. Such behaviour is also a part of 
the harassment. 
19. 
 
In the present case, Respondent No.6 brought the complaint 
after 1½ years. It cannot be dismissed only on the ground of delay, as the 
Petitioner wishes. In Uzma Naveed Chaudhary, supra, the Supreme Court 
held that in our social and cultural milieu, where prevailing notions of 
family honour and taboos play a vital role, it is challenging for a woman to 
speak up about instances involving sexual harassment. The victims, among 
other things, fear that the delinquent may level counter-allegations against 
them. Therefore, those who dare to come forward should not be turned 
away merely because they filed their complaint late. The courts, tribunals 
and authorities concerned must understand the victim’s predicaments, take 
a lenient view on the issue of delay, and decide the case on merits. This 
will encourage victims to come forward to seek justice. The Supreme Court 
further stated: “The principle enunciated by this Court in several criminal 
cases3 involving sexual assault, that delay in reporting the incident to the 
police in such cases is not material, equally applies to the complaints of 
sexual harassment made under the Act.” 
20. 
 
The Petitioner claims that the Act only applies to women who 
are regular or contractual employees in an organization. University students 
do not have a legal remedy under it. I am afraid the argument is fallacious.

Shahzad (2015 SCMR 825); Yasmin v. Majid (2008 SCMR 1602); Muhammad Abbas v. State  
(PLD 2003 SC 863); Mehboob Ahmad v. State (1999 SCMR 1102); and Nasreen v. Fayyaz Khan  
(PLD 1991 SC 412).

A cumulative reading of the various provisions of the Act would show that 
any woman or man harassed by the employer or employee of an 
organization at a workplace can invoke the jurisdiction of the 
Ombudsperson or the Inquiry Committee. In this context, the definitions of 
“accused”, 
“complainant”, 
“organization”, 
and 
“workplace” 
are 
particularly important. As per section 2(a), “accused” means an employer 
or employee of an organization against whom a complaint has been made 
under the Act. According to section 2(e), “complainant” means a woman or 
man who has made a complaint to the Ombudsperson or the Inquiry 
Committee on being aggrieved by an act of harassment. Section 2(l) states 
that an “organization” includes an educational institution. Under section 
2(n), “workplace” means the place of work or the premises where an 
organization or the employer operates. 
21. 
 
I, therefore, hold that the complaint of Respondent No.6 was 
competent. 
22. 
 
The Petitioner’s acquittal by the Judicial Magistrate in FIR 
No. 64/2019 does not preclude the University from proceeding against him 
under the Act. It is trite that proceedings before a domestic forum are 
separate from criminal proceedings, and the decision in the one has no 
bearing on the other. More importantly, in the present case, the Judicial 
Magistrate acquitted the Petitioner not on merits but under section 249-A 
Cr.P.C. There could be many reasons why Respondents No.5 & 6 backed 
out from criminal prosecution. The Petitioner cannot plead it as a ground 
for dropping proceedings under the Act. The following excerpt from Arif 
Ghafoor v. Managing Director, H.M.C., Taxila (PLD 2002 SC 13) is 
instructive: 
“… disciplinary proceedings and criminal proceedings by no stretch of 
imagination can be termed as synonymous and interchangeable. The 
“disciplinary proceeding” and “criminal proceedings” are quite distinct 
from each other, having altogether different characteristics. There is 
nothing common between the adjudicative forums by whom separate 
prescribed procedure and mechanism is followed for adjudication, and 
both forums have their own domain of jurisdiction. The decision of one 
forum would have no bearing on the decision of the other forum in any 
manner whatsoever. In the said background, it would be a misconceived 
notion to consider the acquittal in a criminal trial as an embargo against 
disciplinary proceedings. The learned Federal Service Tribunal has 
rightly referred to the law as laid down in [Mir Nawaz Khan v. Federal 
Government, and others] 1996 SCMR 315. It is worth mentioning that 
the factum of acquittal pressed time and again into service was not on 
merits, but on the contrary, it was an acquittal under section 249-A 

Writ Petition No. 7682/2020 
 
- 9 - 
Cr.P.C. and no evidence worth the name could be produced by the 
prosecution to substantiate the allegations for reasons best known to it. 
Be that as it may, the acquittal was not on merits. Thus, the dictum laid 
down in [Attaullah Sheikh v. WAPDA and others] 2001 SCMR 269 and 
[Waris Khan v. Inspector-General of Police, N.-W.F.P., Peshawar, and 
another] 1998 SCMR 2003 heavily relied upon by Mr Ibrahim Satti, 
Advocate, cannot be made applicable in the peculiar circumstances of 
the case as discussed hereinabove. Had the case been decided on merits 
and after the recording of evidence, the situation would have been 
different.” 
 
23. 
 
The Petitioner also has a grievance that the Inquiry Committee 
has condemned him without following due process. Here, he has a point. 
Admittedly, on 19.2.2019, the Inquiry Committee issued the Petitioner a 
questionnaire to which he responded. Thereafter, it confronted him with 
messages exchanged between him and Respondent No.6 on their 
cellphones and WhatsApp, and the forensic reports, and concluded its 
findings. 
In 
Jan 
Muhammad 
v. 
General 
Manager, 
Karachi 
Telecommunication Region, Karachi, and another (1993 SCMR 1440), 
the Supreme Court held that a question and answer session could not be 
equated with a regular inquiry. It disapproved the inquiry proceedings 
conducted through a questionnaire without examining witnesses supporting 
the charge or defence. 
24. 
 
Section 4 of the Act outlines the procedure for holding 
inquiries. Sub-section (1)(c) thereof states that the Inquiry Committee may 
examine any oral or documentary evidence supporting the charge or in 
defence of the accused that it deems necessary. In addition, it grants each 
side the right to cross-examine the witnesses produced against it.  
25. 
 
Cross-examination is vital to test the credibility of a witness. 
Taylor writes: “Cross-examination is justly regarded as one of the most 
efficacious tests by means of which the law has devised for the discovery 
of truth and by means of which the situation of the witness with respect to 
the parties and to the subject of litigation, his interest, his motives, his 
inclination and prejudices, his character, his means of obtaining correct and 
certain knowledge of the facts to which he bears testimony, the manner in 
which he has used the means, his power of discernment, memory and 
description are fully investigated and ascertained.”4 
                                          
4 Extract from Taylor on Evidence 5th Edn., p.1238 (reproduced in AIYAR & AIYAR’S  
The Principles and Precedents of the Art of Cross-Examination, 10th Edn. published by Butterworths 
India at page-2).

26. 
 
In Browne v. Dunn, [(1893) 6 R. 67], the British House of 
Lords held that “nothing would be more absolutely unjust than not to 
cross-examine witnesses upon evidence which they have given.” In the 
case cited as Abel v. The Queen [(1955), 115 C.C.C. 119 (Que. Q.B.)], 
the Court held that “there can be no question of the importance of cross-
examination … It is the ultimate means of demonstrating truth and of 
testing veracity. Cross-examination must be permitted so that an accused 
can make a full answer and defence. The opportunity to cross-examine 
witnesses is fundamental to providing a fair trial to an accused. This is 
an old and well-established principle that is closely linked to the 
presumption of innocence.” In Wolff, Warden et al. v. McDonnell  
[418 U.S. 539 (1974)], the U.S. Supreme Court observed that "without 
any right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, the inmate is 
afforded no means to challenge the word of his accusers. Without these 
procedures, a disciplinary board cannot resolve disputed factual issues in 
any rational or accurate way. The hearing will thus amount to little more 
than a swearing contest, with each side telling its version of the facts –
and, indeed, with only the prisoner’s story subject to being tested by 
cross-examination. In such a contest, it seems obvious to me that even 
the wrongfully charged inmate will invariably be the loser. I see no 
justification for the court's refusal to extend to prisoners these procedural 
safeguards which in every other context we have found to be among the 
minimum requirements of due process.” In Kartar Singh v. State of 
Punjab (1994) 3 SCC 569, the Supreme Court of India held that cross-
examination is an acid test of the truthfulness of the statement made by a 
witness. In Ghulam Rasool Shah and another (2011 SCMR 735), the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled that cross-examination is the most reliable 
method for judging the credibility of a witness. Statements admitted 
without cross-examination result in injustice. Hence, a reasonable 
opportunity for cross-examination must be provided. 
27. 
 
Even in a domestic inquiry, the person charged with 
misconduct has a right to cross-examine the witnesses brought against him. 
In Meenglas Tea Estate v. Its Workmen (AIR 1963 SC 1719), the inquiry 
consisted of putting questions to each workman in turn. No witness was 
examined in support of the charge before the workman was questioned. 

Writ Petition No. 7682/2020 
 
- 11 -
The Supreme Court of India ruled that the inquiry was vitiated because it 
was not conducted in accordance with the principles of natural justice. The 
relevant excerpt is reproduced below: 
“It is an elementary principle that a person who is required to answer a 
charge must know not only the accusation but also the testimony by 
which the accusation is supported. He must be given a fair chance to hear 
the evidence in support of the charge and to put such relevant questions 
by way of cross-examination as he desires. Then he must be given a 
chance to rebut the evidence led against him. This is the barest 
requirement of an enquiry of this character, and this requirement must be 
substantially fulfilled before the result of the enquiry can be accepted. A 
departure from this requirement, in effect, throws the burden upon the 
person charged to repel the charge without first making it out against 
him.” 
28. 
 
Article 10 of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to a 
fair trial, also applies to departmental inquiries. While the right to cross-
examination is vital to the inquiry process, it is an essential component of a 
right to a fair trial as well. In the present case, the Inquiry Committee has 
violated the Petitioner’s constitutional and statutory rights by denying him 
an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses testifying against him. The 
Impugned Order cannot, therefore, be sustained. 
29. 
 
In view of the above, this petition is accepted, and the 
Impugned Order is set aside. The case is remanded to the Inquiry 
Committee for de novo proceedings against the Petitioner. Since it is an old 
and serious matter, the Inquiry Committee shall conclude it within two 
months from receipt of a certified copy of this judgment.
