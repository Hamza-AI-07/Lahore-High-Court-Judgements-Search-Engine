counsel where necessary 
14.11.2024. Mr. Atta ul Manan Malik, Advocate. 
 
Through this constitution petition, the legal heirs 
of Muhammad Ramzan son of Noor Muhammad, cited in 
the memorandum of parties as petitioner and pro forma 
respondents (hereinafter mentioned as ‘petitioner’/ 
‘petitioners’), 
have 
challenged 
the 
order 
dated 
11.03.2024 passed by the learned Civil Judge Shujabad, 
District Multan, whereby the application filed by 
respondent No. 3/Kousar Mai (“respondent”) to set aside 
ex parte proceedings initiated against her vide order 
dated 04.10.2013 and subsequent ex parte decree dated 
11.07.2015 was accepted with the result that by setting 
the same aside suit filed by the petitioner against her was 
revived and petitioner has also challenged the order dated 
25.10.2024 passed by the Learned Additional District 
Judge, Shujabad, District Multan, who has dismissed 
their revision petition to up hold the decision of the 
learned trial court. 
 
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner states that 
respondent No.3 filed an application for setting-aside ex 
parte decree on 29.06.2022 by mentioning therein that 
she had attained knowledge regarding passing of ex parte 
judgment and decree dated 11.07.2015 on 22.02.2022, 

2 
WP No. 15231 of 2024 
Dated 14.11.2024 
which was beyond limitation and the said application has 
been allowed without attending to her application under 
Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1908 (“Act”) for 
condonation of delay, which was not decided and hence 
prejudice has been caused to the legal heirs of the 
petitioner, therefore, prays for setting aside the impugned 
orders. 
3.  
The 
deceased predecessor-in-interest 
of 
the 
petitioner namely Muhammad Ramzan son of Noor 
Muhammad filed suit for cancellation of mutation 
No.1596 dated 21.03.2000 regarding 04-Kanals land 
transferred to the respondent out of total 18-Kanals land 
situated in Khata no. 422, mauza Chak R.S Shujabad, 
District Multan and recovery of gold ornaments against 
the respondent on the ground that after receiving the said 
benefits his wife, the respondent, who was married to 
him on 28.03.2000, had deserted him and became 
‘ghairabad’, without any reason and despite receiving 
maintenance allowance obtained ex parte decree for 
divorce on 02.11.2011, hence was not entitled to retain 
the said property and gold ornaments. In the suit filed by 
the petitioner ex parte proceedings were initiated against 
the respondent on 04.10.2014 and ex parte decree was 
passed on 11.07.2015. The stance of the respondent in 
her petition to set aside ex parte proceedings and decree 
was that she got knowledge of the same on 22.02.2022 
and thereafter moved application on 29.06.2022. The 
main contention of the respondent in her petition was that 
her incomplete/wrong address i.e. Mouza Khuja, Tehsil 
Shujabad, District Multan was mentioned by the 
predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners instead of whole 
address which was ‘Chah Addi Wala, Mouza Khuja, 
Tehsil Shujabad, District Multan’ and therefore, her 

3 
WP No. 15231 of 2024 
Dated 14.11.2024 
service could not be effected by any way, so ex parte 
decree was obtained by concealment of facts. Many 
documents brought on record during the proceedings 
before the learned Trial Court showed the address of the 
said respondent as "Chah Khapri Wala, Mauza 
Sikandarabad" and impugned orders passed by both the 
courts below mention that even the predecessor-in-
interest of the petitioners himself filed an application to 
set aside proceedings against him wherein he mentioned 
the above mentioned address of the respondent. It was 
also noted that the deceased predecessor-in-interest of the 
petitioners also filed an appeal against the judgment and 
decree dated 21.09.2021; where he himself again 
mentioned the address of the respondent as “Chah 
Khapri Wala, Mauza Sikandarabad”. It has also been 
noted by the courts below that even process server had 
reported that no female of the name of the respondent 
was present at the address given in the plaint. Relying 
upon the available material and record, the learned Trial 
Court has passed the impugned order dated 11.03.2024, 
whereby the ex parte proceedings and decree passed 
against her have been set-aside. The learned Additional 
District Judge did not find any wrong application of facts 
and law in the said order and up held the same. 
4. 
It is not the case of the petitioners that application 
of condonation of delay had not been filed or that the 
court was unaware that the said application had been 
filed and in that scenario due to mis-reading or non-
reading of record the court was not justified to allow the 
application for setting aside ex parte proceeding and 
decree. Had the case been so this court may have 
considered to remand the matter to be decided afresh 
while also considering afore-referred aspect of the matter 

4 
WP No. 15231 of 2024 
Dated 14.11.2024 
but the position is otherwise and not so. Rather, the 
grievance raised by the counsel for the petitioners is that 
the application for condonation of delay had been filed 
which despite being referred to in the impugned orders 
had not been decided therefore, the impugned order and 
judgment are not sustainable and are liable to be set aside 
for the reason that an application going to the root of the 
matter has remained undecided and hence the matter is 
liable to be remanded for decision afresh. It is pertinent 
to mention here that this court in its constitutional 
jurisdiction is not required to interfere in each and every 
case, where the court or forum below has proceeded with 
some irregularity while deciding the matter. It was held 
in Raunaq Ali etc. vs. Chief Settlement Commissioner 
and others (PLD 1973 SC 236) that “an order in the 
nature of a writ of certiorari or mandamus is a 
discretionary order. Its object is to foster justice and 
right a wrong. Therefore, before a person can be 
permitted to invoke this discretionary power of a Court, 
it must be shown that the order sought to be set aside had 
occasioned some injustice to the parties. If it does not 
work any injustice to any party, rather it cures a manifest 
illegality, then the extra ordinary jurisdiction ought not 
to be allowed to be invoked.”   
5. 
Although it is general practice of procedural law 
that where an application going to the root of the matter 
remains undecided usually the courts remand the matter 
for decision of the same afresh, while also keeping in 
view the contents of the said application, but the same is 
not an absolute rule of law and the courts may refuse to 
set aside the decision inter alia for the reasons that 
prejudice has not been caused to the rights of the parties 
or by the said decision justice has been done and to set 

5 
WP No. 15231 of 2024 
Dated 14.11.2024 
aside the said decision would result in prejudice to the 
right(s) of any of the parties. 
6. 
The question that arises is that whether in the 
present case through the impugned order and judgment 
justice has been done or prejudice has been caused to the 
parties and further that whether balance for preventing 
prejudice to parties is in favour of upholding the said 
decision or setting aside the same and could it be held 
that the limitation had impliedly been condoned by both 
the aforementioned courts while allowing the application 
to set aside ex parte proceedings and decree to revive the 
suit filed by the predecessor of interest of the petitioners 
against respondent. 
7. 
Similar situation came up before the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in case titled Ashiq Hussain Shah vs. 
Province of Punjab through Collector District, Attock 
and 6 others (2003 SCMR 1840), wherein the decision 
of case without decision of application for condonation 
of delay was under consideration and it was treated as 
under:- 
“4. The perusal of the averments of the plaint would show 
that prior to the filing of suit, a criminal case under section 
447, P.P.C. was registered against the petitioner for illegal 
occupation of above land. In the suit the petitioner claimed 
that the Patwarkhana was situated adjacent to the land in 
dispute and in the written statement, the stand of the 
respondents was that the suit-land was owned by the 
Province of Punjab and was in possession of Patwarkhana 
as per demarcation held on 4-12-1989 and that the new 
building of Patwarkhana was being constructed on the land 
owned by the Government. It was stated in the application 
for setting aside the ex parte decree that the official who 
was deputed to pursue the suit, neither appeared before the 
Court nor informed the concerned authorities that the suit 
was decreed ex parte. We having gone through the 
judgment in appeal find that the question of limitation was 
not dealt with as such and respondent also did not offer 
sufficient explanation for non-appearance in the Court but 
we cannot permit the taking away of the Government 
property for the negligence of subordinate officials. The 
manner in which the matter was pursued by the subordinate 
officials would show that they did not properly watch the 

6 
WP No. 15231 of 2024 
Dated 14.11.2024 
Government interest and the possibility of their being in 
league with the petitioner being not ruled out, we are not in 
favour of non-suiting the respondents on technical grounds 
and would prefer that the rights of parties should be 
determined 
in 
the 
property 
on 
merits, 
therefore, 
notwithstanding the disposal of appeal on merits without 
dealing with the question of limitation in express words, it 
would be deemed that there was implied condonation of 
delay.” 
 
8. 
In another case this court in case titled 
Muhammad 
Sadiq 
vs. 
Administrator, 
Residual 
Properties, 
Multan 
Division, 
Multan/Additional 
Commissioner (Revenue), Multan Division, Multan and 
another (1985 CLC 369 (Lahore)), has addressed a 
similar situation as under:- 
“6. As regards the first contention raised by the learned 
counsel for the petitioner, there is no doubt that the revision 
petition was filed by respondent No.2 after the expiry of 
limitation 
period 
prescribed, 
therefor, 
the 
learned 
Administrator, Residual Properties, respondent No.2 
accepted the revision petition without giving any specific 
decision on the question of limitation raised before him. 
Impugned order, however, shows that the learned 
Administrator was quite conscious of the question of 
limitation and in fact, he took note of the objection raised in 
this behalf and yet he proceeded to deal with the revision 
petition on merits and remanded the case to the Deputy 
Administrator for fresh decision of the crucial issue viz. 
whether or not the property in dispute was evacuee and 
available for transfer. In these circumstances, learned 
Administrator can be taken to have impliedly condoned the 
delay. Even otherwise, question of limitation was relatable 
to the question of the evacuee or non-evacuee nature of the 
property in dispute for the determination of which the case 
was remanded by the Administrator. If the property in 
dispute is ultimately found to be non-evacuee, it was quite 
evidently not available for transfer to the petitioner and in 
that event, order of the Deputy Administrator challenged in 
the revision petition before the Administrator would be 
coram non judice and consequently question of limitation 
would not arise. In this view of the matter, precedents 
relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner are of 
no avail to him. Moreover, I find that in the cases relied 
upon by the petitioner, the Settlement Authorities were not 
even conscious that any question of limitation arose in the 
matters before them.  In the instant case, the learned 
Administrator as shown above was quite conscious of the 
question of limitation and he remanded the case for fresh 
decision of what he described as 'basic fact in issue' viz, 
whether or not the area in dispute was evacuee and 
available for transfer. This disposal, in my opinion, 

7 
WP No. 15231 of 2024 
Dated 14.11.2024 
indicates 
that 
the 
learned 
Administrator 
impliedly 
condoned the delay. Judgments relied upon by the 
petitioner, therefore, are not strictly applicable to the 
present case. Even otherwise, order of the Deputy 
Administrator transferring the area in dispute to the 
petitioner having admittedly been passed in the absence of 
the respondent No.2 and without notice to him, question of 
limitation did not arise. Resultantly, order of the learned 
Administrator disposing of the revision petition on merits 
does not suffer from any legal infirmity by reason of the 
delay not having been expressly condoned.” 
  
9. 
In the present case, the mutation of tamleek of 
property in favour of respondent was cancelled through 
ex parte decree passed in favour of predecessor in interest 
of the petitioner, which decree has been set-aside by 
courts below on the ground that service of the respondent 
had not been effected, and the suit has been restored to 
enable the parties to contest the same for reaching a just 
conclusion on its own merits. It is settled law that no one 
should be condemned unheard and parties should not be 
knocked out on the basis of technicalities. Moreover 
where substantial justice has been done, it is not 
necessary for this Court to interfere in Constitutional 
jurisdiction on the basis of technicalities alone for the 
reason that Constitutional jurisdiction is discretionary in 
character and where courts below have given concurrent 
conclusions, Superior Courts generally do not interfere in 
the conclusions arrived at by courts and Tribunals below. 
Reliance is placed on Tehsil Nazim TMA, Okara vs. 
Abbas Ali and 2 others (2010 SCMR 1437). In the 
present case, if the said decree was allowed to remain in 
the field the same would cause prejudice to the rights of 
the respondent to get the matter decided on merits. By 
revival of the suit, petitioners still have a right to pursue 
the remedy available to them under the law, hence no 
serious prejudice would be caused to them if the said 
decision is upheld and in this scenario keeping position 

8 
WP No. 15231 of 2024 
Dated 14.11.2024 
of both the parties in juxtaposition it is concluded that 
balance to avoid prejudice to the rights of the parties tilts 
in favour of maintaining the decision of setting aside the 
ex parte proceedings and decree and revival of suit for its 
decision on its own merits. In view of the foregoing, even 
if application filed under Section 5 of the Act was not 
decided, as proprietary rights of the parties are involved, 
hence it was appropriate to condone the delay in filing 
application for setting-aside ex parte decree and 
consequently order passed by both the courts below are 
interpreted in the manner that as while setting aside ex 
parte decree the courts below were conscious of 
pendency of the application for condonation of delay, 
hence the delay in filing the application for setting aside 
ex parte proceedings and decree although not dealt with 
in express terms had been impliedly condoned which is 
permissible in view of the principles laid down in the 
aforementioned judgments and the said orders in the 
interest of justice are deemed to be modified to the extent 
that delay in filing application for setting-aside ex parte 
decree is condoned and by allowing said application, the 
ex parte proceedings and decree are set-aside and the suit 
filed by the petitioners is revived, which shall be decided 
afresh on its own merits in accordance with law.  
10. 
For what has been discussed above, this petition 
being devoid of any merit is dismissed.
