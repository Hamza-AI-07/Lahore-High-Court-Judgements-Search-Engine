appeal, 
appellant Munir Hussian Shah has challenged the vires of judgment dated 
26.09.2019 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Shorkot in case 
FIR No.248, dated 16.04.2017, in respect of offence under Sections 302 & 
458 PPC, registered at Police Station Shorkot City, District Jhang whereby 
he was convicted and sentenced as under:-

Death and to pay the compensation of Rs.2,00,000/- under Section 
544-A Cr.P.C. to the legal heirs of deceased Husnain Abbas and in 
default thereof to further undergo simple imprisonment for six 
months. 
Under Section 458 PPC 
Rigorous Imprisonment for five years with fine of Rs.10,000/- and in 
default thereof to further undergo simple imprisonment for two 
months.  
 
2. 
Murder Reference No.300/2019 sent up by the trial Court for 
confirmation or otherwise of death sentence of appellant will also be decided 
through this common judgment.  
3. 
The prosecution story unfolded in the crime report (Ex.PA/1) 
registered on the complaint of Shafqat Abbas (PW-5) was that on 
16.04.2017 he alongwith his brothers Husnain Abbas, Sajid Abbas and one 
Jahangir Abbas (guest) were sleeping in the courtyard. Due to illness of his

child, complainant was waking. At about 02:00 (night) Munir Hussain 
(appellant) while armed with repeater 12-bore alngwith two unknown armed 
persons entered into the courtyard of his house. Appellant raised lalkara to 
teach a lesson for not giving the land of his choice and made two 
consecutive fires with repeater 12 bore at Husnain Abbas hitting at the right 
thigh and right side of his abdomen. On voice of firing, Sajid Abbas and 
Jahangir witnessed the occurrence in the light of bulb. Accused persons 
while making lalkaras and resorted to aerial firing fled away from the spot. 
The injured was shifted to Civil Hospital, Shorkot but he succumbed to the 
injuries.  
 
 Motive behind the occurrence was that his land was situated on the 
road and the appellant intends to get the same exchange with his own land 
and on refusal, he committed this crime.   
4. 
Muhammad Hayat Sargana, Inspector (PW-7) visited the place of 
occurrence, inspected dead body of deceased Husnain Shah, prepared injury 
statement (Ex.PC) and inquest report (Ex.PD). He prepared rough site plan 
(Ex.PK), obtained a piece of blood stained Khais vide memo (Ex.PH) and 
took into possession electric bulb vide memo (Ex.PG). He recorded 
statements of the eye witnesses under Section 161 Cr.P.C.  He arrested the 
appellant on 10.05.2017, who led to the recovery of repeater 12-bore (P-6) 
and motorcycle (P-7) vide recovery memos (Ex.PI) & (Ex.PJ). During 
investigation, the appellant was found involved in this occurrence and he got 
prepared report under Section 173 Cr.P.C.  
5. 
Dr. Saif-ur-Rasool (PW-2) held autopsy on the dead body of deceased 
Husnain Abbas on 16.04.2017 and observed two injuries on right side of 
lower abdomen and right thigh at upper and outer part. According to his 
opinion, cause of death was due to injury No.1 which damaged major blood 
vessels (abdominal aorta, IVC and right iliac artery) caused hemorrhage and 
shock. Injuries No.1 & 2 were sufficient to cause death in ordinary course of 
nature. Probable duration between injuries and death was immediate 
whereas between death and postmortem examination about 6 to 8 hours. 
6. 
At the commencement of the trial, the trial Court framed a charge 
against the appellant to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.

7. 
The prosecution produced 07-witnesses besides the reports of Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency (Ex.PL & Ex.PL/1). The appellant, in his 
statement under Section 342 Cr.P.C. had denied and controverted all the 
allegations of fact leveled against him. He neither opted to make statement 
under Section 340(2) Cr.P.C. on Oath nor produced any evidence in his 
defence.  
8. 
Learned trial Court, upon conclusion of the trial, convicted and 
sentenced the appellant as stated above.  Hence, this criminal appeal and the 
Murder Reference. 
9. 
We have heard learned counsels for the appellant, learned Addl. 
Prosecutor General appearing for the State assisted by learned counsels for 
the complainant and gone through the record with their able assistance.  
10. 
This unfortunate incident took place on 16.04.2017 at about 02:00 
a.m. (night), which was reported to the police promptly on the same day at 
about 03:30 a.m. i.e. within 1 ½ hours and formal FIR (Ex.PA/1) was 
chalked out at 03:45 a.m., despite the fact that inter-se distance between the 
place of occurrence and the police station was twenty six kilometers 
containing name of the accused with his specific role of making fire shots at 
the deceased, which not only confirms presence of the eye witnesses at the 
spot but also excludes every hypothesis of deliberation, consultation and 
fabrication prior to the registration of the case and also rules out the 
possibility of mistaken identity or substitution. Reliance is placed on case 
reported as Noor Sultan and others ..Vs.. The State (2021 SCMR 176), 
wherein it has been laid down as under:- 
“The instant occurrence has taken place on 6.15 p.m. while the matter was 
reported to the police within 2.15 hours whereas inter-se distance between 
the place of occurrence and police station is 16 kilometers. Promptness in 
reporting the matter to the police reflect that there is no chance of 
consultation or deliberation at the part of the prosecution.” 
Similarly, in case reported as Shaheen Ijaz alias Babu ..Vs.. The State 
(2021 SCMR 500), it has been laid down as under:- 
“…..petitioner’s nomination in a broad day light incident by resident 
witnesses hardly admits a space to entertain any hypothesis of mistaken 
identity or substitution. Prompt recourse to law straight at the police station 
excludes every possibility of deliberation or consultation.”

In case reported as Muhammad Waris ..Vs.. The State (2008 SCMR 784) it  
has been laid down as under:- 
“The names of the said two eye-witnesses could not have been mentioned in such 
a promptly lodged F.I.R. if they had not been with the deceased persons at the 
time of their death.” 
11. 
Case of the prosecution hinges upon, ocular account, medical 
evidence, recovery and motive part of the occurrence. In order to prove 
ocular account, Shafqat Hussain, (PW-5)/complainant while appearing in the 
dock in the court room reiterated the contents of the crime report deposing 
that on the fateful day, Husnain (deceased), Jahangir Abbas (PW-6) and 
Sajid Abbas (given up PW) were sleeping in the courtyard of his house, 
whereas, he was awoken, due to ailment of his son. Electric bulb was lid in 
the courtyard. At about 2.00 a.m. (night) appellant Munir Hussain while 
armed with repeater gun alongwith two unknown armed persons, trespassed 
into the courtyard of his house. Appellant raised lalkara to teach us lesson 
for not giving agricultural land of his choice and made two repeated fire 
shots, which landed on the right thigh and right side of abdomen of his 
brother Husnain Abbas. Witnesses saw the occurrence in the light of bulb. 
Accused persons left the place of occurrence while raising lalkaras. They 
shifted the injured to THQ, Hospital, Shorkot in a car but he succumbed to 
the injuries. Motive behind the occurrence was that the land of deceased was 
situated at road side and appellant wanted to exchange the same with his 
own land  and upon his refusal committed his murder. Jahangir Abbas, (PW-
6) while appearing in the dock in the Court room unflinchingly supported 
the complainant on all material points and deposed that on the fateful day, he 
went to the house of the complainant to see his ailing son and in his view the 
appellant made two fire shots with his repeater gun, which landed at the 
right side of abdomen and thigh of deceased Husnain Abbas.  During the 
course of cross-examination, both the witnesses of ocular account remained 
firm and consistent on all material aspects of the incident qua the date, time, 
place, mode and manner of the occurrence, name of the appellant, weapon of 
offence and the role played by him for committing murder of the deceased 
and the defence could not shatter their credibility on material points.  

M.R. No.300/2019 
Crl. Appeal No.78457 of 2019

Learned counsel for the appellant submits that acclaimed eye witness 
Jahangir Abbas (PW-6) was the resident of Thatti Ailchi, which was 22/23 
kilometer away from the place of occurrence, as such his presence in the 
house of the complainant,  in odd hours of night was highly improbable. We 
tend not to agree with this submission. No doubt the place of occurrence was 
not the abode of this witness but this fact alone cannot be made universal 
rule for disbelieving the presence of an eye-witness at the place of 
occurrence. If a witness furnished a plausible explanation of his presence at 
the place of occurrence at the relevant time the same ought to have been 
considered and if the same was found plausible or appeals to a prudent mind, 
the same shall be given weightage, irrespective of the fact that the acclaimed 
eye-witness was the resident of the same vicinity or not. Here in the instant 
case not only the complainant in crime report (Ex.PA/1) explained that the 
aforesaid witness came to his house as a guest but the said witness while 
appearing in the dock in the court room categorically furnished the reason of 
his visit to the house of the complainant in the manner that “ On 15.04,2017, 
I went to visit the son of Shafaqat Hussain, who was ill.” This witness was 
close relative of the complainant and in our rural set up, close relatives used 
to visit the house of each other on multiple occasions, including marriages, 
bereavement or to see an ailing family member and their overnight stay 
cannot be seen with doubt. Even otherwise, on this point the defence has 
questioned (PW-6) at a considerable length but he remained firm and 
consistent and the defence failed to shake his testimony in this regard. The 
crime report was lodged with sufficient promptitude, and (PW-6) faced the 
test of lengthy cross-examination with full confidence and described the 
incident minutely, which established his presence at the venue of occurrence 
at the relevant time without any doubt. Even if for the sake of arguments, 
testimony of the said witness is excluded from consideration even then it 
would not be helpful to the defence. In the matter of appreciation of the 
evidence it is not the number of witnesses rather quality of evidence is worth 
importance.  There is no requirement under the law that a particular number 
of witnesses are necessary to prove/disprove a fact. It is time honoured 
principle that evidence must be weighed and not counted.

Shafqat Hussain, (PW-5)/ complainant, was the resident of the same 
house and his presence in his own house at night time cannot be questioned. 
He while appearing in the dock before the trial Court categorically raised 
accusing finger towards the appellant for making two fire shots on the right 
side of abdomen and right thigh of deceased Husnain. He faced the test of 
lengthy cross-examination with full confidence, which could not be crushed 
by the defence with even a slight difference.  This sole statement is 
sufficient to believe the prosecution version and bring home guilt against the 
appellant beyond shadow of doubt. Reliance is placed on case titled “NIAZ-
UD-DIN and another Versus THE STATE and another” (2011 SCMR 725), 
“The statement of Israel (PW.9) the eye-witness of the occurrence 
is confidence inspiring, which stand substantiated from the 
circumstances and other evidence. There is apt observations 
appearing in Allah Bakhsh v. Shammi and others (PLD 1980 SC 
225) that even in a murder case conviction can be based on the 
testimony of a single witness, if the Court is satisfied that he is 
reliable.  The reason being that it is the quality of evidence and not 
the quantity which matters.”   
13. 
Learned counsel for the appellant emphatically argued that both the 
acclaimed eye-witnesses were closely related to the deceased as such their 
testimonies being interested witnesses cannot be believed at all. No doubt 
both the witnesses were near relatives inasmuch as the complainant was real 
brother and Jahangir Abbas (PW-6) was cousin of the deceased but the 
incident has taken place inside the house and no one except the inmates of 
the house were in a position to state who was responsible for committing the 
murder of deceased. In such like cases, when incident took place inside the 
house, testimonies of the inmates of the house have more credence as 
compared to anyother witness, as it would be unrealistic for a person other 
than the inmate of the house to state what happened inside the house. Here in 
the instant case, both the witnesses were present inside the house, therefore, 
they were quite natural witnesses, who can conveniently describe the 
incident in the manner as it happened as compared to any other independent 
witness.  Moreso, there was no earthly reason for the eye witnesses to falsely 
implicate the appellant in substitution of the real culprits.  Even otherwise, 
substitution of the real culprits with an innocent one, in particular, where the 

M.R. No.300/2019 
Crl. Appeal No.78457 of 2019 
 
 
7 
 
 
eye-witnesses have lost their close kith and kin, is a rare phenomenon.  It is 
well established principle in criminal administration of justice that mere 
relationship of the eye-witnesses with the deceased is not sufficient to 
discard their evidence, if the same was otherwise found confidence inspiring 
and trustworthy.  Reliance is placed on case reported as “Ghulam Murtaza 
Versus. The State” (2021 SCMR 149). 
14. 
Next argument of the learned defence counsel was that the 
Investigating Officer has not collected blood-stained earth from the place of 
occurrence, which shows that the incident has not taken place at the site as 
alleged by the prosecution. The purpose of collection of blood stained earth 
from the place of occurrence is to detect the human blood from the crime 
scene and it was the duty of the Investigating Officer to collect the same.  
Herein the instant case, the Investigating Officer instead of collecting blood 
stained earth from the crime scene took into possession, a piece of Khais 
/cloth smeared with blood, with which the deceased covered himself at the 
time of sleeping vide recovery memo (Ex.PH).  During cross-examination 
Muhammad Hayat, (PW-7)/Investigating Officer explained that “It was not 
necessary for me to take the blood stained beddings into possession. 
Voluntarily said that for determination of existence of human blood, the 
blood stained khais was taken into possession.” From the tenor of the 
statement of the Investigating Officer, it is abundantly clear that he was sure 
enough that while taking into possession blood stained khais, he has 
performed his part of duty and there was no need for him to collect anyother 
blood stained material from the spot. Moreso, the crime report has been 
lodged with much promptitude, which could not be possible if the crime 
scene was other than as alleged by the prosecution. Even otherwise, non-
collection of blood stained earth from the crime scene at the most could be 
considered as an irregularity on the part of the Investigating Officer and no 
premium can be extended to the appellant on that basis. Reliance is placed 
on case reported as “Sheraz Asghar ..Vs.. The State” (1995 SCMR 1365), 
wherein it has been observed that 
 “Besides any irregularity committed during the investigation of 
case would neither affect the trial of the case nor the judgment 
passed by the Courts.”

15. 
Learned counsel for the appellant while referring to the reply of 
complainant (PW-5) in cross-examination that “Before ¾ months before 
the alleged occurrence, accused Munir Hussain Shah shifted his family at 
Khanewal in a rented house for the purpose of education of his children”    
laid much emphasis that the appellant has left the village long ago and 
was not present at the place of occurrence on the fateful day but the 
Investigating Officer deliberately not collected Call Data Record (CDR) 
of the appellant to determine his location at the time of unfortunate 
incident. Admission of the complainant that appellant shifted somewhere 
else prior to the occurrence solely is not sufficient to absolve his 
responsibility for committing the crime. It is a common pattern of the 
wrong doers to change their place of residence prior to committing a 
crime, in order to divert the concentration of the family of the victim with 
regard to actual culprit but here in the instant case both the acclaimed 
eye-witnesses had seen the appellant committing the murder of the 
deceased with their eyes and they while appearing in the dock in the court 
room raised accusing finger towards the appellant as such mere shifting 
of his family to some other place prior to the occurrence cannot be made 
a ground to give him clean chit. So far as non-collection of appellant’s 
CDR for determination of his location is concerned, suffice it to say that 
CDR only shows that the SIM registered in the name of a particular 
person is being used in geographical jurisdiction of a specific Tower 
but in the absence of forensically evaluated voice record transcript/ 
end to end audio or video recording, it does not unveil who was 
carrying/using the SIM at the relevant time. Reliance is place on case 
reported as “Mst. SAIMA NOREEN  vs. The STATE and another” (PLD 
2024 Lahore 522)” wherein Full Bench of this Court has observed as 
under:- 
 
“It is very much relevant to mention here that if question in a case is only 
regarding availability of any SIM in the territorial jurisdiction of any cellular 
tower at the time of receiving or making any particular phone call then perhaps 
CDR would provide some help but if the matter in issue is about presence of any 
human being either witness or accused on some particular place as a recipient or 
maker of the phone call as in this case is, then situation is quite 
different/otherwise.

10. Although any accused or witness can claim or admit possession and 
use of any SIM “Subscriber Identity Module’ by him or anybody else at the time 
of occurrence or any other relevant time yet mere such claim or admission is not 
sufficient for relying on CDR “Call Data Record” of said SIM because CDR only 
shows use of SIM in territorial/geographical jurisdiction of “Cell Phone Tower” 
installed by telecom operator and does not disclose that who is actually/exactly 
carrying and using said SIM…”; 
16. 
Dr. Saif-ur-Rasool (PW-2) held autopsy on the dead body of deceased 
Husnain Abbas on 16.04.2017 and observed two injuries on right side of 
lower abdomen and right thigh at upper and outer part. According to his 
opinion, cause of death was due to injury No.1 which damaged major blood 
vessels (abdominal aorta, IVC and right iliac artery) caused hemorrhage and 
shock. Injuries No.1 & 2 were sufficient to cause death in ordinary course of 
nature. Probable duration between injuries and death was immediate 
whereas between death and postmortem examination about 6 to 8 hours. 
 
Learned defence counsel argued that the post mortem was conducted 
after 6 to 8 hours of the expiry of the deceased but the Medical Officer has 
not observed rigor mortis, as such the time of death does not tally with the 
ocular account. We have given anxious consideration to this submission. 
Rigor mortis is a fourth stage of death. It is one of the recognizable sign of 
death characterized by stiffening of the limbs of the corpse caused by 
chemical changes in the muscles. According to Medical Jurisprudence & 
Toxicology by Dr. Gupta & Agrawal normally rigor mortis starts to develop 
after three hours of the death and completes in 12-18 hours. Dr. S. Siddiq 
Husain in Chapter-V of his book “Forensic Medicine and Toxicology” 
observed that in moderate climate the rigor mortis completes in 8 to 12 
hours. However, there is a consensus in Medical Jurisprudence that onset 
and duration of rigor mortis varies between individuals due to number of 
factors including:- 
(i) 
Body condition:  Rigor mortis sets in more quickly in people 
who are thin or emaciated. In people with low muscle mass, 
rigor mortis may not form at all or may be minimal.  
(ii) 
Age: Rigor mortis occurs earlier in both early youth and old 
age.  

M.R. No.300/2019 
Crl. Appeal No.78457 of 2019 
 
 
10 
 
 
(iii) Temperature: Warmer temperatures speed up the onset of rigor 
mortis. Cold temperatures slow down the process of rigor 
mortis.  
(iv) 
Physical activity: If a person engages in strenuous exercise 
before death, rigor mortis may set in immediately.  
(v) 
Illness. Illness is a physiological stress that can lead to a rapid 
onset of rigor mortis. 
(vi) 
Body fat: Fat insulates the body, slowing the rate of rigor 
mortis.  
According to Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology by Dr. K.S. Narayan 
conditions of altering the onset and duration includes, age, nature of death, 
muscular state and atmospheric conditions and with regard to medical 
importance it was observed  that “(1) It is a sign of death. (2) Its extent helps 
in estimating the time of death, which is not reliable.. (emphasis supplied).”  
Similarly, in Butterworths Medico-Legal Encyclopaedia by J.K. Mason and 
R.A. McCall-Smith, it was observed that “It is apparent that the basic 
condition of the body, its specific state at death and the environment in 
which it lies will greatly affect the appearance of these signs, which are 
discussed as individual entries. A corollary to the changes already described 
is that the chemistry of the body will be greatly altered by the processes 
occurring after death; the biochemical state discovered at autopsy may 
therefore bear very little relation to conditions in life. It follows that great 
care must be exercised in making a diagnosis of ‘physiological’ or 
‘biochemical’ death on the basis of the interpretation of postmortem 
chemical estimations. Some of the post mortem alterations may be 
sufficiently specific to have a limited use in the time of death.”  In Taylor’s 
Principles and Practice of Medical Jurisprudence it was explained in the 
following manner:- 
 
“Time of onset and disappearance of rigor mortis. In sudden natural 
deaths occurring in a temperate climate during average seasonal conditions rigor 
mortis usually commences within 2 to 4 h of death. It reaches a peak in about 12 h  
of death and starts to disappear after another 12 h, the cadaver becoming limp 
some 36h after death. These times are variable even under the conditions 
mentioned. There are, however, many extrinsic and intrinsic factors which may 
profoundly affect the onset and duration of rigor mortis. As some of these 

M.R. No.300/2019 
Crl. Appeal No.78457 of 2019 
 
 
11 
 
 
influencing factors are frequently associated with violent or unnatural deaths, the 
value of rigor mortis in assessing the post-mortem interval is limited and its use 
may be misleading….. 
 
…. Thus it is easy to understand that rigor mortis should come on slowly 
in healthy, muscular subjects who have died without convulsions, as, for instance, 
by decapitation, by sudden haemorrhage, by judicial or even other forms of 
hanging. In such cases the muscles have no more than the average amount of 
waste metabolites in them, and have their usual circulation at the moment of 
death, conditions favourable to the continuance of local life, of which rigor marks 
the end.” 
 Further, according to Parikh’s Textbook of Medical Jurisprudence and 
Toxicology, the onset of rigor is later and duration is longer in the strong 
muscular persons. Similarly, in cases of sudden death a late onset and long 
duration of rigor mortis is normal. Here in the present case, according to 
column No.16 & 17 of Inquest Report (Ex.PD), it was a dead-body of a 
healthy and strong person of 40/42 years. Moreover, at the time of death, the 
deceased was sleeping, as such, he was in a relax mode and these factors are 
sufficient to contribute in late onset of rigor mortis. Additionally, in case 
reported as “Muhammad Sharif alias Sharifi and another ..Vs.. The State 
(1968 P Cr.LJ 213)”  where the occurrence took place at digarvaila but the 
autopsy on the dead body of the deceased was conducted on the following 
day at 10.00 a.m. and the doctor has not observed development of rigor 
mortis but the Apex Court has observed as under:- 
 
“ It was next contended that the post-mortem was held at 10 a.m. on 8th 
August 1963, when the rigor mortis had not started and as such the story that the 
occurrence took place at digarwala on 7th August, 1963, was false. No doubt, the 
doctor has said that generally in hot weather rigor mortis starts after six hours, but 
there are no hard and fast rules about it. It will suffice to say that rigor mortis may 
be delayed due to various other facts.” 
 
Learned counsel also emphasized that according to the opinion of the 
doctor duration between the injuries and death was “immediate”, whereas, 
according to the acclaimed eye-witnesses, they shifted the deceased to the 
hospital where he breathed his last. To our mind this is also not helpful to 
the defence. Eye-witnesses were ordinary people, who cannot be presumed 

M.R. No.300/2019 
Crl. Appeal No.78457 of 2019 
 
 
12 
 
 
to determine the death of an injured person there and then. It is a matter of 
common observance that after sustaining of injuries, near and dear ones, in 
the first instance, attempted to shift the injured to the hospital with a ray of 
hope for his survival, therefore, shifting of the deceased to the hospital, even 
if actually he has expired is not unusual in our social set up. We are 
constrained to hold that medical evidence lends full support to the ocular 
account.  
17. 
Appellant was arrested on 10.05.2017 and during investigation he led 
to the recovery of repeater 12-bore (P.6) which was sent to the office of 
Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore and according to the report of said 
office (Ex.PL) the same was found to be in a mechanical operating condition 
but since no crime empty was secured from the spot in the absence whereof 
weapon of offence cannot be connected with the appellant, therefore, 
recovery remained inconsequential.  
18. 
Motive as set out by the prosecution was that the appellant wanted to 
exchange valuable agricultural land of the deceased situated at road side 
with his land and upon refusal of the deceased, he committed his murder. 
Nothing in black and white has been placed on record to establish that the 
parties were in possession of their respective lands pursuant to any partition. 
During cross-examination, the complainant (PW-5) deposed as under:- 
“It is incorrect that me and the accused are co-sharers in the agricultural land till 
today. PW volunteers that private partition/Wanda was made in the year 1980 and 
it was not made part of revenue record. No suit for partition was filed by Munir 
Shah accused or from my side. There was no quarrel between the parties with 
respect of partition of agricultural land and no criminal case was ever registered 
between two families except the case in hand.”  
Since neither there was any proper partition of the land which was 
made part of revenue record nor there was any quarrel between the parties 
qua the agricultural land as admitted by the complainant, therefore, motive 
as set out by the prosecution is nothing except words of mouth.  
19. 
For what has been discussed above, we have entertained no manner of 
doubt in our mind that the prosecution has successfully proved the charge 
against the appellant for committing the murder of deceased through cogent, 

M.R. No.300/2019 
Crl. Appeal No.78457 of 2019 
 
 
13 
 
 
reliable and confidence inspiring evidence. Appellant was named in the 
promptly lodged FIR with a specific role of making repeated fire shots on 
right thigh and right side of abdomen. Parties were previously known to each 
other, as such question of miss-identification does not arise in any 
eventuality. Both the acclaimed eye-witnesses have well established their 
presence at the venue of occurrence at the relevant time. The ocular account 
is firm and consistent inter-se supported with the medical evidence. The 
complainant would have been the last person to falsely implicate the 
appellant in case of murder of his brother in substitution of real culprit. Even 
otherwise, substitution is always considered a rare phenomenon in cases 
where the complainant lost his/her close kith and kin. This overwhelming 
evidence constrained us to concur with the conclusion arrived at by the trial 
Court qua the conviction of the appellant under Section 302(b) PPC. 
20. 
Now coming to the quantum of sentence. It is well settled by now that 
question of quantum of sentence, requires utmost caution and thoughtfulness 
on the part of the Court. In this regard, reliance is placed on case reported as 
Mir Muhammad alias Miro ..Vs.. The State (2009 SCMR 1188) wherein 
it has been laid as under:- 
“It will not be out of place to emphasize that in criminal cases, the question of quantum of 
sentence requires utmost care and caution on the part of the Courts, as such decisions 
restrict the life and liberties of the people. Indeed the accused persons are also entitled to 
extenuating benefit of doubt to the extent of quantum of sentence.” 
Here in the instant case, we have taken note of some mitigating factors. 
Firstly, recovery of weapon of offence from the appellant remained 
inconsequential. Secondly, motive as set out by prosecution remained un-
proved, which alone is sufficient for reduction of quantum of sentence. 
Reliance is placed on case reported as “ Kamran ..Vs.. The State through 
A.G. Khyber Pakhunknwa and others (2024 SCMR 1419)”.  
 
21. 
In view of what has been discussed above, the appeal of the appellant 
stands dismissed by maintaining his conviction in offence under Section 
302(b) PPC, however his sentence of capital punishment is converted into 
one of imprisonment for life. The amount of compensation and sentence in 
lieu thereof as well as his conviction and sentence U/S 458 PPC shall remain 
intact.  The appellant is given benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C.
