Respondent(s)by 
Mr. Shehzada Mazhar, Advocate for 
respondent No. 3. 
 
 
SULTAN TANVIR AHMAD, J:– Through this 
judgment, present petition as well as constitutional petitions No. 
25057 of 2020, 25053 of 2020, 25060 of 2020,  25047 of 2020,  
25055 of 2020 and 25050 of 2020, filed under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, shall be 
decided. These petitions are argued before this Court on the 
same grounds. The judgments as well as orders assailed in the 
said petitions are similar. The questions of law and facts raised 
are also identical. For the sake of convenience and clarity, dates 
and facts as well as names or number of witnesses of the 
captioned petition shall be referred in this judgment.  
2.  
The petitioner has assailed judgment dated 
02.03.2020 passed by learned Additional District Judge, Jhang, 
whereby, appeal against order dated 16.10.2019 passed by 

 
Writ Petition No. 25062 ,25057, 25053, 25060,   
25047,  25055 and 25050 of 2020                                      (Judgment) 
 
 
2 
learned Civil Judge 1st Class, Jhang / Rent Tribunal has been 
dismissed. 
3.  
Facts, necessary for the disposal of the present 
petition, are that on 26.07.2014 petitioner filed ejectment 
petition against respondent  No. 3 with the averments that 
Ghulam Qasim, who was owner of some property in khata No. 
396, khasra  No. 148 situated in Lakkar Mandi, Jhang, as 
further described in the ejectment petition (the ‘premises’), 
rented out the premises to respondent No. 3; that respondent 
No. 3 was told by the said Ghulam Qasim that he sold out the 
premises to the petitioner and in future  respondent No. 3 
should pay rent to the petitioner, who allegedly admitted the 
same and paid monthly rent at the rate of Rs.2000/- per month 
to the petitioner for the months of July & August, 2012 but 
after that respondent No. 3 committed default in payment of 
the rent amount(s). Respondent No. 3 filed leave to appear and 
defend the case on 09.10.2014. The learned Special Judge 
Rent, Jhang allowed the application of leave to appear and 
defend the case vide order dated 20.10.2014. The parties led 
their evidence. On 16.10.2019 the learned rent tribunal gave 
issue-wise findings and dismissed the ejectment petition. 
Being dissatisfied from this order of the learned rent tribunal, 
the petitioner filed civil appeal No. 12 / 13 of 2020 on 
07.11.2019, which was dismissed by the learned Additional 
District Judge, Jhang vide judgment dated 02.03.2020. 
Aggrieved from the same, present petitions have been filed. 
4.    
Ms. Kashwer Naheed, learned counsel for the 
petitioner, has submitted that learned two Courts below have 
ignored section 2 (d) of the Punjab Rented Premises Act, 2009 
(the ‘Act’) which recognizes that any person having ownership 
of the premises or part thereof or share in joint khata can file 
ejectment petition. She claims that petitioner, being owner of 

 
Writ Petition No. 25062 ,25057, 25053, 25060,   
25047,  25055 and 25050 of 2020                                      (Judgment) 
 
 
3 
the premises on the strength of sale deed / Exh.A2 (the ‘sale 
deed’) and mutation No. 41674 / Exh. A6, has rightly contacted 
the learned rent tribunal. It is submitted that respondent No. 3 
paid rent for two months i.e. July and August, 2012 at the rate 
of Rs.2000/- per month then went into default; that prior to this 
respondent No. 3 was paying rent to Ghulam Qasim who was 
owner on the strength of Exh.A7. She submits that respondent 
No. 3 after the execution of the sale deed, acknowledged that 
the petitioner will be entitled to receive rent as new owner 
instead of Ghulam Qasim. It is the stance of the learned counsel 
for the petitioner that any person who is owner in joint khata 
can seek eviction of tenant in the given khata as per law laid 
down in cases titled “Mst. Badarun Nisa Versus Dr. Abdul 
Rehman and Others” (PLJ 2017 SC 457) and “Mohammad 
Akram Bhatti Versus Additional District Judge, Attock and 3 
Others” (2021 CLC 1405). 
5.  
On the other hand, Mr. Shahzada Mazhar-learned 
counsel for respondent No. 3, has supported the order as well as 
judgment passed by learned two Courts below and he has 
submitted 
that 
no 
ground 
requiring 
interference, 
in 
constitutional jurisdiction, is made out. Learned counsel for 
respondent No. 3 has also relied upon the contradictions in 
evidence led by the petitioner. He has submitted that no 
relationship of landlord and tenant could be established 
between the parties concerned.  
6.  
 
Heard. The documents available on the record 
have been perused. 
7.  
 
In order to prove the issue as to the existence of 
landlord and tenant relationship, the petitioner has adopted the 
stance that respondent No. 3 has acquired possession of the 
premises from Ghulam Qasim, the purported previous owner, 
who has sold the premises to the petitioner through the sale 

 
Writ Petition No. 25062 ,25057, 25053, 25060,   
25047,  25055 and 25050 of 2020                                      (Judgment)

deed and Ghulam Qasim at the time of sale told respondent No. 
3 that from there onwards he would be tenant of the petitioner, 
who acknowledged the same. In the entire ejectment petition no 
name of witness is mentioned in the presence of whom the 
alleged statements were made by Ghulam Qasim or respondent 
No. 3. Nevertheless, he later introduced two witnesses of the 
said fact, namely Mehmood (AW-2) and Fazal-ur-Rehman 
(AW-3). Both the witnesses tendered their affidavits but Fazal-
ur-Rehman / AW-3 has contradicted various parts of the 
statement of the petitioner / AW-1. Fazal-ur-Rehman / AW-3 
failed to answer most of the important questions and kept 
stating that he had no knowledge as to those questions or facts. 
He stated that respondent No. 3 has acknowledged as to the 
tenancy or payment of the future rent to petitioner but 
contradicted the statement of petitioner / AW-1 as to the time of 
this alleged oral acknowledgement as well as number of 
persons present at that time. The following contradictions, 
besides several other, are important:- 
AW-3 / Fazal-Ur-Rehman

8.  
 
Not just the petitioner failed to mention names of 
witnesses of oral tenancy / acknowledgment by respondent   
No. 3 in his leave and he led evidence beyond his pleadings but 

 
Writ Petition No. 25062 ,25057, 25053, 25060,   
25047,  25055 and 25050 of 2020                                      (Judgment)

at the same time the only witness produced by the petitioner has 
contradicted him, causing further damage to his case. The said 
witness further admitted that he is nephew of the petitioner. He 
gave clear impression that he has stated only on account of this 
relationship.  
9.  
 
 One Mehmood is also stated to be present at the 
material time but the said person was not produced for cross-
examination, claiming that respondent-side won him over. It is 
alleged by the petitioner that rent of two months of July and 
August, 2012 was paid by respondent No. 3 but he miserably 
failed to prove it through, oral or documentary, evidence. The 
falsehood to the extent of oral tenancy between petitioner and 
respondent No. 3 or any acknowledgment of respondent No. 3 
in this regard is amply clear.  
10.  
 
Now coming to the argument of Ms. Kashwer 
Naheed-learned counsel for the petitioner, regarding landlord 
and tenant relationship between Ghulam Qasim and respondent 
No. 3. It is claim of respondent No. 3 that he is tenant of Sh. 
Pervaiz Ahmad on the strength of an agreement in writing, 
drawn on stamp paper and registered with rent registrar on 
14.05.2015, which is brought on record as Exh. R8. This 
registered document carries presumption of correctness, which 
is further supported by cogent and confidence inspiring 
evidence of RW-1 and RW-2. Conversely, there is nothing 
available on record to establish that Ghulam Qasim and 
respondent No. 3 had landlord and tenant relationship. Oral 
tenancy between the two is pleaded, to make out the case that 
the petitioner has stepped into shoes of Ghulam Qasim. This 
oral tenancy could not be proved by producing any receipt or 
leading independent evidence. The evidence as to alleged 
acknowledgment of respondent No. 3 in the year 2012 is 
already discussed which is found to be highly contradictory and

25047,  25055 and 25050 of 2020                                      (Judgment)

undependable.  
11.  
 
The last argument of Ms. Kishwar Naheed-learned 
counsel for the petitioner is based on section 2 (d) of the Act 
and she has submitted that in order to maintain a successful 
ejectment petition, without establishing anything else, it is 
sufficient that the petitioner is co-owner of joint khata where 
the premises is situated. She has relied on “Mst. Badarun Nisa” 
case (supra). Here, it will be advantageous to reproduce the 
relevant sections of the Act:- 
2 (d) “landlord” means the owner of a premises and 
includes a person for the time being entitled or 
authorized to receive rent in respect of the premises;     
2 (e)    xxx 
2 (f)    xxx 
2 (g)    xxx 
2 (h)    xxx 
2 (i)    xxx 
2 (j)    xxx 
2 (k)    xxx 
 
2 (l)  “tenant” means a person who  undertakes or is 
bound to pay rent as consideration for the occupation 
of a premises by him or by any other person on his 
behalf and includes; 
(i). 
a person who continues to be in 
occupation of the premises after the termination 
of his tenancy for the purpose of a proceeding 
under this Act; 
(ii). 
Legal heirs of a tenant in the event of 
death of the tenant who continue to be in 
occupation of the premises; and  
(iii). a sub-tenant who is in possession of the 
premises or part thereof with the written consent 
of the landlord; and”  
 
 
   
 
The reproduced definition of landlord admits two 
categories of persons (i) the owner, and (ii) a person who is 
authorized or entitled to receive rent provided any of the 
following grounds, given in section 15 of the Act, is available:-   
“15. Grounds for eviction. A landlord may seek 
eviction of the tenant if: 
(a) the period of tenancy has expired; 

 
Writ Petition No. 25062 ,25057, 25053, 25060,   
25047,  25055 and 25050 of 2020                                      (Judgment) 
 
 
7 
(b) the tenant has failed to pay or tender the rent 
within a period of thirty days after the expiry of 
the period stipulated in section 7; 
(c) the tenant has committed breach of a term or 
condition of the tenancy agreement; 
(d) the tenant has committed a violation of an 
obligation under section 13; 
(e) the tenant has used the premises for a 
purpose which is different from the purpose 
for which it has been let out; or 
(f) the tenant has sub-let the premises without 
the prior written consent of the landlord.” 
 
12.  
 
Combined reading of sections 13 and 15 of the Act 
as well as definitions of landlord and tenant reflects that remedy 
of eviction under the Act is available only when the landlord of 
the given premises can first establish that one sought to be 
evicted has a relationship of tenant with such landlord. This 
eviction petition can be maintained upon expiry of tenancy, 
failure of payment of rent, breach of terms and conditions of 
tenancy agreement, violation by tenant of obligation under 
section 13 of the Act and unauthorized use of premises or sub-
letting without written consent. All the grounds given in section 
15 of the Act require some violation by the tenant. If a person is 
not a tenant of the ejectment petitioner that means no ground is 
available to such person to seek eviction of tenant.  
13.  
 
The jurisdiction of rent tribunals is provided to 
regulate the relationships of landlords and tenants, to provide a 
mechanism for settlement of their disputes in an expeditious and 
cost effective manner and for the matters connected thereto. This 
jurisdiction is not available as an alternate to other jurisdictions 
provided in law or claims of possession through partition or 
disputed title or for that matter other claims that are required to 
be resolved by the civil Courts. 
14.  
 
As far as reliance of learned counsel for the 
petitioner on “Mst. Badarun Nisa” case (supra) is concerned, 
the same is distinguishable from the facts of the present case. In 

 
Writ Petition No. 25062 ,25057, 25053, 25060,   
25047,  25055 and 25050 of 2020                                      (Judgment)

case titled “Ch. Abdul Waheed through L.Rs. Versus Zahida 
Parveen alias Nagina and 5 Others” (2021 YLR 1973) this 
Court has already observed as follows:- 
“Perusal of both the terms clearly depicts the 
receiving of rent and payment of rent are sine qua 
non for establishing the relationship of tenancy 
between the parties and in a case where the 
relationship itself is under question then, it 
becomes further necessary and imperative to prove 
the existence of relationship between the parties 
through evidence and for the very purpose the 
factum of payment of rent by the tenant to landlord 
is pivotal to prove or disprove the claim of tenancy 
and relief sought. In the case of “Muhammad 
Ibrahim V. Niaz Muhammad”(2016 CLC 609), 
same principle was laid down as under:- 
  
“It is an established principle that 
once a tenant is always a tenant, but in the 
described circumstances the initial burden 
was on the respondent (applicant) to 
establish his status either as of owner or of 
landlord of the house in question, to enable 
him to seek for eviction of the appellant. 
There was no document which could 
describe his (respondent’s) status as of 
owner of the house in question. There was 
even no specific oral evidence stating 
payment of rent to the respondent by the 
appellant, or any other act on part of the 
appellant which determined his status as of 
tenant of the respondent. 
Learned Special Judge (Rent) is not concerned 
with the ownership of the premises in question. 
This ejectment petition was filed under the Punjab 
Rented Premises Act, 2009, and even its all 
provisions are very specific and clear.” 
15.  
 
The petitioner has set-up the grounds of eviction in 
paragraph No. 6 of his eviction-petition. This paragraph reads as 
follows:-  
  یلخ ےہ    دیب

The ground (iii) above i.e. requirement of property for personal 
use is not available in the Act. The grounds (i), (ii), and (iv) 
above, are dependent on the relationship of landlord and tenant. 
As already discussed, the petitioner miserably failed to establish 
this relationship between himself and respondent No. 3. The 
petitioner alleged that respondent No. 3 was tenant of previous 
owner (Ghulam Qasim) but he could not prove this either by 
leading dependable evidence.  
16.  
 
I am of the considered opinion that the learned two 
Courts below have properly appreciated the evidence led by the 
parties and correctly applied the law to facts of the case. No 
case 
requiring 
any 
interference, 
through 
constitutional 
jurisdiction of this Court, is made out. Consequently, these 
petitions are dismissed. No order as to costs.
