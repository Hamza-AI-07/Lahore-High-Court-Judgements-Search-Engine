ASIM HAFEEZ, J.  
This and connected constitutional petition, 
bearing W.P No.4869 of 2024/BWP (for convenience of reference 
they are identified as ‘main petitions’), primarily question the legality 
of decisions taken at the meeting dated 15.06.2024 - chaired by Senior 
Member Board of Revenue/Chief Land Commissioner Punjab, which 
meeting apparently was carried out pursuant to the letter of 11th June 
2024, addressed to the Managing Director Cholistan by Secretary 
Implementation Committee, wherein, on the application of some of 
the legal heirs of Late Ameer of Bahawalpur, who had alleged 
conduct of illegal sale of land by some of the legal heirs, a request 
was made for taking action in wake of violations of Acceding State 
(Property) Order 1961].  
  
Petitioners, additionally, seek declaration against follow-up 
actions / orders by the Board of Revenue – pursuant to the meeting of 
15.06.2024 - whereby it proceeded to cancel revenue Mutations, 
claimed by the petitioners to be allegedly recorded in their favour, 
either by or on behalf of legal heirs of Late Ameer of Bahawalpur - 
[reference to legal heirs implies indication to those legal heirs with 
whom transactions, subject of cancelled Mutations, were alleged, and 
not to all of the legal heirs]. By way of background, it is pertinent to 
highlight that Implementation Committee [in short ‘SAFRON’] had 
been entrusted with the task of distribution of the properties of Late 
Ameer of Bahawalpur, amongst Late Ameer’s legal heirs, in light of 
judicial decisions and in particular, section 3 of the Acceding State 
(Property) Order 1961 [President’s Order No.12 of 1961] and decision 
in the case of Prince A.M. Abbasi and another V. Federal Government 

W.P. No.5106/2024 
 
 
3
through Secretary and 24 others (PLD 2002 Supreme Court 170). 
Implementation Committee in meeting on 08.01.2024 directed 
Managing Director Cholistan Development Authority to complete the 
process of transfer of land of Shikar-gah in the name of the legal heirs 
of Late Ameer of Bahawalpur, besides issuing other directions. In 
meeting on 15.02.2024, Implementation Committee recorded 
observations, on the information of Managing Director Cholistan, that 
process of recording of Mutations had been completed and process of 
Mutations in the name of the descendants of some of the legal heirs is 
underway. And pursuant to the letter of 11th June 2024 and decisions 
of the Meeting of 15.06.2024, alleged Mutations inter alia in favour 
of the petitioners were cancelled. This is brief background of 
proceedings out of which present petitions, arose.      
2. 
Learned counsel for petitioners of main petitions, while 
explaining their interest in the property, submit that after recording of 
the Mutations in favour of the heirs of Late Ameer of Bahawalpur, 
petitioners, who had previously entered into executory arrangements 
with some of the legal heirs, - [with whom executory arrangements 
through agreements / general power of attorney’s, regarding sale of 
part of the property were entered with] – proceeded to seek 
enforcement of executory arrangements and concluded those 
arrangement(s) through execution and recording of respective 
Mutations. (Copies of Mutations and cancellation endorsements 
thereupon are appended with the petitions.) Notably, none of the legal 
heirs, with whom executory arrangements are alleged and claimed to 
have been concluded, are impleaded as parties. Therefore, any 
comment or discussion regarding the validity and lawfulness of 
underlying transactions, subject matter of Mutations in question, is 
consciously avoided to avoid prejudice. Question of cancellation of 
Mutations is a different matter and dealt with, specifically.   
3. 
In nutshell, primary grievances of the petitioners of main 
petitions are two-fold. Firstly, that Mutations, once executed and 
recorded by the revenue officers, cannot be cancelled by or under 

W.P. No.5106/2024 
 
 
4
orders of the Board of Revenue unilaterally and without issuance of 
prior notices. And secondly, that conduct of meeting of 15.06.2024, 
held pursuant to letter of 11th June 2024 of the Secretary 
Implementation Committee and decisions taken therein were devoid 
of any legality because before issuance of letter of 11th June 2024, 
Implementation Committee ceased to be effective, after expiry of 
allotted term and absence of any extension, to-date. 
4.  
There are two other petitions fixed along, bearing W.P No.5382 
of 2024/BWP and W.P No.5672 of 2024/BWP (for convenience of 
reference they are identified as ‘ancillary petitions’), wherein the 
petitioners are claiming interest in the property on the basis of alleged 
executory agreements, allegedly executed on various occasions but 
before the recording of Mutations in favour of the legal heirs of late 
Ameer of Bahawalpur – legality or otherwise of executory agreements 
and existence thereof is not subject matter of adjudication. These 
petitions seek enforcement of decisions of meeting of 15.06.2024; 
directions to give continuing effect to the order of cancellation of 
Mutations; directions to ensure conduct of inquiry against delinquent 
officers, responsible for recording Mutations, though cancelled, and 
protection of alleged possession of land. Notably, petitioners therein, 
simultaneously, claim tenancy rights on the premise that property, 
notwithstanding being recorded in the name of legal heirs, had been 
resumed by the State under the Land Reforms Regulations – it is not 
for this court to comment qua the legality of alleged  claim based on 
executory agreements, question of resumption of land under question, 
and issue of grant of tenancy and entitlement thereto, which are alien 
to the lis and otherwise not amenable to constitutional jurisdiction. 
5. 
Office of the Attorney General pleads that task of 
Implementation Committee was not fully complete, which was 
required to deliver possession of land amongst the legal heirs - 
acknowledged and 23 in numbers, which may include descendants of 
some of the heirs. It is pleaded that there is every likelihood that the 

W.P. No.5106/2024 
 
 
5
Government would pass requisite orders for extending term of the 
Implementation Committee, to allow it to complete the task assigned. 
6. 
On last date of hearing main petitions were entertained for 
hearing and interim injunction was granted in terms of order of 
05.07.2024.  
7. 
Heard. Record and applications perused. Various applications 
were filed in petitions under reference, which inter alia seek 
permission to implead the applicants and placement of documents. 
And one of the application bearing C.M. No.4354/2024 in W.P. 
No.4869/2024, seeks permission to supplement the prayer clause – 
seeking relief in the nature sought in W.P. No.5106/2024. 
Applications are considered while deciding the matter and no need is 
felt to adjourn the matter, determination whereof is confined to 
deciding legal questions, largely relating to the interpretation of 
decisions, variously passed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan 
and justiciability of orders of cancellation of Mutations.   
Contextual description of present controversy:   
8. 
Context of the challenge thrown and controversy at hand need 
to be contextualized. Fundamentally, grievances are directed against 
decisions made at the meeting on 15.06.2024 and orders / actions 
taken regarding cancellation of Mutations, on the premise that 
Implementation Committee had no lawful existence to address letter 
of 11th June 2024. It is repeatedly emphasized that requirements of 
section 163(2)(c) of the Land Revenue Act 1967 were not adhered to, 
which renders action of cancellation void, being taken without 
issuance of notices and affording hearing.  
9. 
Foundation of the argument is inherently misconceived. Facts 
and circumstances encountered are unique. It is pertinent to 
distinguish the scope and effect of cancellation of Mutations, from 
ordinary proceedings relating to the cancellation of Mutations. 
Provisions of Acceding State (Property) Order 1961 [President’s 

W.P. No.5106/2024 
 
 
6
Order No.12 of 1961] and decisions by Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan are distinguishing features, which extend protection to the 
orders of cancellation of Mutations. Ordinarily, the Revenue 
Authorities, when confronted with the matters calling for cancellation 
of recorded Mutation(s), may either assume jurisdiction to review the 
Mutation(s), subject to notice or suggest the parties to approach court 
exercising general jurisdiction, in case an intricate question of law is 
involved or issue of determination of title requires recording of 
evidence. This discourse is not relevant for the purposes of present 
controversy and why so? Answer is found upon perusal of the 
contents of letter No.CDA-2024/Col/384-85 dated 15th June 2024, 
wherein reference to various decisions of Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan were made, inter alia to orders of 07.04.1982 and 02.10.2018 
– former was passed in the case reported as Brig. His Highness 
Nawab Muhammad Abbas Khan Abbassi V. Deputy Land 
Commissioner, Bahawalpur and others (1982 SCMR 991) and later 
was passed while adjudicating “Civil Appeals No. 883 to 886 of 2012 
and 1187 to 1190 of 2016”. It is expedient to reproduce paragraphs 2 
to 7 of the order of 02.10.2018 first, which read as:- 
“2. 
The relevant portion of the aforesaid judgment reported as Brig. 
His Highness Nawab Muhammad Abbas Khan Abbasi v. Deputy. Land 
Commissioner, Bahawalpur and others (1982 SCMR 991) referred to in 
the impugned judgment and in the leave granting order of thisCourt reads 
as under:- 
"The result will be that as soon as the final position of the holdings 
of the heirs of late Ameer of Balıawalpur has been decided by 
respondent No.3, respondents Nos.1 and 2 will be at liberty to 
proceed under the provisions of the Land Reforms Regulation, 
1959 (MLR 64). The orders of the Land Reforms Authorities 
impugned before us are, accordingly, set aside with the 
clarification that as soon as respondent No.3 makes the final order 
under Article 3 of the Acceding State (Property) Order, 1961, the 
respondents Nos.1 and 2 can proceed further in the matter in 
accordance with law.” 
3. The Federal Government has filed CMA No.9227 of 2017 wherein it has 
been stated that pursuant to the aforesaid judgments of this Court 
Government of Pakistan v. His Highness Nawab Muhammad Abbas Khan 
Abbasi and others (PLD 1982 SC 367) and Briq. H.H. Nawab Muhammad 
Abbas Khan Abbasi, Ameer of Bahawalpur v. The Government of Pakistan 
and others (PLD 1984 SC 67) to implement the same, a Committee was 
formed under the Chairmanship of Mr. Justice A. S. Salam, former Judge 
of this Court. The said Committee submitted its report dividing the 

W.P. No.5106/2024 
 
 
7
property among the heirs of His highness late Ameer of Bahawalpur, 
including the present Respondents and such distribution has been 
accepted by the said legal heirs whereupon the Federal Government in 
exercise of the powers conferred by Article 3 of the Acceding State 
(Property) Order 1961 (PO No.12 of 1961) and all other powers enabling 
it in this behalf, issued further amendment through SRO No.946(1)/2003 
dated the 30th September 2003 (Annex III) in the "Devolution and 
Distribution of Property (Ameer of Bahawalpur) Order, 1969". 
4. The aforesaid actions and consent to the distribution of the land as well 
as the issuance of the Notifications by the Federal Government have been 
confirmed by the learned counsel for the Respondents. 
5. When confronted with the aforesaid state of affairs, the learned Addl. 
AG Punjab states that the instant appeals have lost its efficacy as the 
conditions specified for proceedings under MLR 64 by the impugned 
judgment have been fulfilled. Under the circumstances, the instant appeals 
are liable to be disposed of. 
6. In the above circumstances, these appeals are disposed of. Any person 
aggrieved by any future action taken by any authority can seek his remedy, 
if any, available under the law. 
7. With regard to the impleadment applications which have primarily been 
filed by the subsequent purchasers, it is to be noted that they are to swim 
and sink with the sellers. Therefore, as the main appeals have been 
disposed of, the impleadment applications have lost their relevance and 
are accordingly dismissed”. 
10. 
And relevant paragraphs from decision in the case of Brig. His 
Highness Nawab Muhammad Abbas Khan Abbassi (supra) are 
reproduced hereunder, for sake of more clarity,  
“However, it has been held in the aforesaid judgment that the distribution 
made in the order of respondent No.3 passed on 20.2.1969 suffers from 
certain infirmities and respondent No.3 has been directed to decide the 
matter afresh in the light of the observations made in the said judgment. 
Consequently, the orders passed by respondents Nos.1 and 2, with regard 
to the distribution of the property as also relating to the resumption of the 
excess area will require modification and case properly be decided only 
after a final decision is taken by respondent No.3, with regard to the 
distribution of the property amongst the various heirs of the late Ameer. 
We may here clarify that the appellant, as also the other heirs of the late 
Ameer, are citizens of Pakistan and are not above the law and that the 
provisions of Martial Law Regulation No.64 are applicable to them but as 
the identity of the exact property owned by each heir is not yet determined 
resumption of the excess area cannot, in these circumstances, be made 
with exactitude.  
The result will be that as soon as the final position of the holdings of the 
heirs of late Ameer of Bahawalpur has been decided by respondent No.3, 
respondents Nos.1 and 2 will be at liberty to proceed under the provisions 
of the Land Reforms Regulation, 1959 (M.L.R. 64). The orders of the Land 
Reforms Authorities impugned before us are, accordingly, set aside with 
the clarification that as soon as respondent No.3 makes the final order 
under Article 3 of the Acceding State (Property) Order, 1961, the 
respondents Nos.1 and 2 can proceed further in the matter in accordance 
with law”. 

W.P. No.5106/2024

[Emphasis supplied] 
11.  
At the outset, it is appropriate to address the argument that 
letter of 11th June 2024 is of no legal effect, since Implementation 
Committee did not exist, legally. Existence or non-existence, 
operability or otherwise, functionality or non-functional status of the 
Implementation Committee on 11th June 2024, for the purposes of 
present petitions, is without any relevance, which situation either way 
does not render the meeting of 15.06.2024 and subsequent action of 
cancellation of Mutations unlawful. Existence of the Implementation 
Committee or otherwise would have had no effect qua the 
applicability, enforcement and implementation of the Land Reforms 
Regulations [referred to as “Land Reforms Regime” – And expression 
Land Reforms Regime contained reference to West Pakistan Land 
Reforms Regulations of 1959 [Martial Law Regulation No.64 of 1959] 
and The Land Reforms Regulations 1972 [Martial Law Regulation 
No.114 of 1972], as the case may be.  
12. 
Meetings of the Implementation Committee on 08.01.2024 and 
15.02.2024 clinches the controversy – whereby it directed recording 
of Mutations in favour of the legal heirs of Late Ameer of Bahawalpur 
and acknowledged doing of needful by Managing Director Cholistan 
Development Authority in subsequent meeting – perusal of the 
minutes of the meetings leaves no doubt qua the business conducted 
therein. Upon execution of the Mutations, question of holding(s) of 
the legal heirs of Late Ameer of Bahawalpur stood settled / decided 
for the purposes of attracting Land Reforms Regime, in the context of 
decisions by the Apex Court. Factum of execution and recording of 
Mutations, in favour of the legal heirs, is not subject of challenge 
through petitions under reference. In light of the decisions (supra), it 
is clear that the moment Mutations were executed and recorded in 
favour of the legal heirs, Land Commission is required to get down to 
business and Land Reforms Regime actuates. Petitioners of main 
petitions and ancillary petitions are unable to satisfy this court that 
how the cause and effect of decision in the case of Brig. His Highness 

W.P. No.5106/2024 
 
 
9
Nawab Muhammad Abbas Khan Abbassi’ (supra), and echoed in the 
order of 02.10.2018, could be evaded or circumvented, where 
obligation cast on Land Commission has been clearly spelled out. It is 
notable that meeting of 15.06.2024 was presided over by Senior 
Member Board of Revenue / Chief Land Commissioner Punjab, which 
otherwise implies assumption of jurisdiction under the orders of Apex 
Court. In these circumstances, letter of 11th June 2024, at best, 
constitutes an intimation of factum of complaint – [by some of the 
legal heirs, objecting to third party sale by some other legal heirs], – 
by the Federal Government. And notwithstanding all shortcomings, 
letter of 11th June 2024 can at best be treated as intimation from 
Federal Government, which owes certain obligations in terms of 
Acceding State (Properties) Order, 1961 in accord with observations 
recorded in the case of A.M. Abbasi and another V. Federal 
Government through Secretary and 24 others (supra), – [paragraph 12 
thereof].   
13. 
Learned counsel fail to appreciate that alleged action of selling 
properties, – [if by some of the legal heris or allegedly carried at their 
behest] – is patently contrary to the decisions of Apex Court and 
actually had the effect of defeating and frustrating the purpose and 
enforcement of Land Reforms Regime. In essence, decision in the 
case of Brig. His Highness Nawab Muhammad Abbas Khan Abbassi 
(supra) had the effect of imposing encumbrance / embargo upon the 
rights of the legal heirs, in dealing with their holdings, subjecting such 
rights to the conditions imposed and constraints prescribed under 
Land Reforms Regime. Directions to the effect that “….as soon as 
final position of holdings of the heirs of late Ameer of Bahawalpur has 
been decided by respondent No.3, respondents No.1 and 2 will be at 
liberty to proceed under the provisions of Land Reforms Regulations 
(1959) …..” constitute an act of imposing a judicial encumbrance qua 
the rights of the legal heirs to deal with holding(s), subjecting it to the 
mandate and purview of Land Reforms Regime. It does not require an 
emphasis that any alleged acquirer of rights / interests from the legal 

W.P. No.5106/2024 
 
 
10
heirs – notwithstanding that transaction(s) claimed are voluntarily 
acknowledged or accepted by some of the legal heirs or denied – 
would be bound and subject to the conditions of orders of 07.04.1982 
and 02.10.2018 of Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, including 
limitations and constraints imposed under the Land Reforms Regime. 
In view of aforesaid position, the Mutations, which otherwise merely 
evidence alleged title or embodiment of underlying transactions, or for 
that matter the alleged executory agreements, are neither enforceable 
nor extend any rights unto the third parties, except an option to 
exercise remedies, such as are available for the enforcement of 
executory arrangements, which in this case are otherwise narrowed 
down, curtailed and subjected to the applicability of Land Reforms 
Regime. No comments or observations are recorded qua the legality 
or otherwise of the transactions and executory agreements. In wake of 
the conditions imposed and encumbrance placed no rights / interest in 
the property could be claimed based on Mutations, which act of 
recording of alleged title is otherwise contrary to the directions / 
decisions of the Apex Court. Article 189 of the Constitution of the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, mandates that decisions are 
binding and need to be enforced. There is another downside of the 
Mutations, executed and recorded. Acknowledging purported 
conveyance by way of alleged Mutations otherwise have had the 
effect of reducing the holdings of those legal heirs, against whom 
claim of sale is alleged. Actually, execution of Mutations or execution 
of executory agreements, voluntarily or involuntarily, implies evading 
of statutory obligations under the Land Reforms Regime.   
14. 
Learned Law Officer along the representative of Land 
Commission Punjab submit that steps have been initiated for 
implementation of the Land Reforms Regulations, qua the 
landholding(s) of the legal heirs of Late Ameer of Bahawalpur. There 
is no cavil that ordinarily Land Commission had the authority to 
determine the validity or voidness of any transaction found violative 
of Land Reforms Regime. The issue at hand is slightly different. It is 

W.P. No.5106/2024 
 
 
11
not disputed that any and all transactions, be it by way of executory 
agreements or Mutations, are subject to the decision in case of Brig. 
His Highness Nawab Muhammad Abbas Khan Abbassi (supra), hence, 
no question of de-novo review of alleged transactions under reference 
by the Land Commission arises, in wake of cancellation of Mutations. 
In terms of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, no 
legitimacy could be claimed or extended to so-called Mutations to the 
prejudice of proceedings under Land Reforms Regime.  
15. 
When asked that how any alleged right / interest could be 
claimed based on alleged Mutations, in wake of the orders of Hon’ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan, learned counsel submit that choice and 
exchange of areas must be provided under the Land Reforms 
Regulations and declarant is eligible to give its choice, where 
holding(s) is found in excess of statutory ceiling prescribed. Be that as 
it may, choice and exchange of area(s) is otherwise subject to 
limitations prescribed, which matter is within the jurisdiction of the 
Land Commission and no observations can be recorded now, 
acknowledging an option of alleged acquirer of rights / interest from 
the legal heirs, which matter will be considered by Land Commission, 
when circumstances would warrant.   
16. 
Consequently, no illegality is attributable to the decisions taken 
in the meeting on 15.06.2024 and subsequent action / orders to cancel 
the Mutations under reference – [not the Mutations executed and 
recorded in favour of the legal heirs] - which action / orders of 
cancellation, in fact, manifest adherence to the directions / decisions 
of Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan (referred supra). Cancellation 
of Mutations under reference constitutes lawful exercise of authority, 
and no interference is warranted to review those orders. It is pertinent 
to observe that cancellation of Mutations does not imply or warrant 
per se cancellation, rescission or termination of the contractual-cum-
executory arrangements, - [authenticity of alleged transactions is not 
subject matter of present proceedings and no determination thereof is 
solicited] - which alleged contractual arrangements may be enforced, 

W.P. No.5106/2024 
 
 
12
by the beneficiaries of cancelled Mutations or the persons claiming 
executory agreements - [without prejudice to the right(s) and 
entitlement of the legal heirs concerned to admit or deny alleged 
contractual transactions whenever the occasion arises] - but only upon 
the enforcement and conclusive implementation of the Land Reforms 
Regime. No conclusiveness could be extended to the contractual 
arrangements at this stage, unless finality is achieved regarding 
proceedings, subject matter of land reforms – this is the mandate of 
the decisions of the Apex Court. 
17.  
Petitions, main and ancillary, along with applications are 
disposed of, subject to the observations recorded in preceding 
paragraph.
