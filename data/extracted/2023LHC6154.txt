In essence, constitutionality of the first 
proviso to Division-VII of Part-1 of First 
Schedule to the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 
Ordinance – inserted through section 5(53) of the 
Finance Act, 2022 – is subject matter of 
challenge [Impugned amendment]. 
2. 
Source of grievance is against chargeability 
to tax, under section 37A of the Ordinance, 2001, 
capital gains accrued inter alia upon disposal of 
the securities during Tax Year 2023. Case 
pleaded is that securities were acquired in the 
year 2011, which were retained for over one 
year, hence, disposal thereof, after retaining those 
for over one year, cannot be subjected to capital 
gains since by virtue of proviso to sub-section (1) 
of section 37A of the Ordinance, 2001, sub-

W.P. No. 20679/2023. 
 
-:2:- 
 
 
 
 
section (1) of section 37A of the Ordinance, 2001 
was made inapplicable, notwithstanding the 
omission of the proviso lately through Finance 
Act 2014. Reliance is placed on the case reported 
as “Anwar yahya and 3 others Vs. Federation of 
Pakistan through Secretary and 4 others” (2017 PTD 
1069). Adds that rights accrued, upon holding of 
securities for over one year, by virtue of the 
proviso, cannot be withdrawn by netting long-
held securities since 2011. Further submits that 
impugned amendment is contrary to the objective 
of encouraging long-term investments. And 
classification carried out in the context of time of 
acquisition of shares and rates applicable, vis-à-
vis 
holding 
period(s) 
prescribed 
are 
discriminatory, which fails test of intelligible 
differentia. Referred the cases of “Commissioner 
Inland Revenue Vs. Federation of Pakistan, etc. (Civil 
Appeal No. 930 and 931 of 2017), “Dr. Muhammad 
Anwar Kurd and 2 others Vs. The State through Regional 
Accountability Bureau, Quetta” (2011 SCMR 1560),

3. 
Conversely, learned Addl. Attorney General 
submits that the case of Anwar Yahya and 3 others. 
(supra) is distinguishable on facts and law, as 
discussed and applied therein. Submits that no 
vested right could be claimed against the statute, 
which right, before maturing into a past and 
closed transaction, could be withdrawn by 
legislature, which was done in this case. Submits 
that no case of discrimination otherwise arises in 
the context of the classification of the timing of 
purchase of securities and period of retention 
thereof. Learned counsel placed reliance on 
decisions reported as “MESSRS ARMY WELFARE 
SUGAR MILLS LTD. and others. Vs. FEDERATION OF 
PAKISTAN 
and 
others.” 
(1992 
SCMR 
1652), 
“MOLASSES TRADING & EXPORT (Pvt.) LIMITED. 
VS. FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN and others.” (1993 
SCMR 1905), “YAR MUHAMMAD and 4 others. Vs. 
SECRETARY, 
FINANCE 
DEPARTMENT, 
GOVERNMENT OF PUNJAB and others.” (2011 SCMR 
1537), “SHAHNAWAZ (PVT.) LTD. through Director 
Finance. Vs. PAKISTAN through the Secretary Ministry 
of Finance Government of Pakistan, Islamabad and 
another.” (2011 PTD 1558) and “COMMISSIONER

INLAND REVENUE ZONE-II, RTO, HYDERABAD. VS. 
MESSRs JAMSHORO POWER COMPANY LTD.” (2017 
PTD  237). 
 
Learned counsel appearing for respondent 
No.2 – FBR - endorsed submissions made by 
Addl. Attorney General. Further submits that no 
case of discrimination is made out and reference, 
in this behalf, is made to paragraph 17 in case 
reported as “D.G. KHAN CEMENT COMPANY 
LIMITED through CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER and 
another. Vs. THE FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through 
SECRETARY REVENUE, ISLAMABAD and 3 others.” 
(2020 PTD 1186). Learned counsel further places 
reliance on the case reported as “FAWAD AHMAD 
MUKHTAR and others. Vs. COMMISSIONER INLAND 
REVENUE (ZONE-II), REGIONAL TAX OFFICE, 
MULTAN and another.” (2022 PTD 454) - latter 
decision is referred on the point that each tax 
year is a separate unit of account and taxation, 
and law, to be applied thereto, shall be in the 
context of relevant tax year.

Heard. 
5. 
Primarily, 
questions 
that 
surface 
for 
determination are whether impugned amendment 
had the effect of consuming / withdrawing vested 
rights claimed, whether ratio settled in the case of 

W.P. No. 20679/2023. 
 
-:5:- 
 
 
 
 
Anwar Yahya and 3 others. (supra) is attracted, 
and whether any manifest discrimination has 
prejudiced the petitioner. 
6. 
There is no cavil that rights claimed, those 
based on past and closed transaction(s) and 
others regarding unconsummated / inchoate 
transaction(s) manifest distinctive features. The 
crucial question is when did the alleged rights 
claimed, if so available at all, becomes past and 
closed transaction, or when those rights become 
irrevocable, even going beyond the realm of 
exercise of legislative powers. Petitioner’s claim 
that rights claimed accrued at the time of 
acquisition of securities and retention thereof for 
over one year, and same are still claimable by 
virtue of proviso to sub-section (1) of section 
37A of the Ordinance, 2001. And conversely, 
department’s 
claim 
is 
that 
question 
of 
applicability of section 37A of the Ordinance, 
2001 would be the date of disposal of securities, 
and by then impugned amendment was in place, 
effective and enforceable. 
Evidently, securities were acquired in the 
year 2011 and sold during Tax Year 2023, and 
amendment was introduced through Finance Act 

W.P. No. 20679/2023. 
 
-:6:- 
 
 
 
 
2022. Apparently, petitioner fails to underpin 
significance of omission of proviso to sub-
section (1) of section 37A of Ordinance, 2001 
through Finance Act 2014. Petitioner’s sole 
reliance is upon the ratio settled in the case of 
Anwar Yahya and 3 others. (supra). Upon 
conscientious perusal of the case referred, I opine 
that said decision has no application here, which 
case had interpreted the then section 37A in the 
context of proviso thereto – period before the 
amendments made by virtue of Finance Act 2014 
and Finance Act 2015. There is another 
significant distinction. In the case of Anwar 
Yahya and 3 others. (supra), claim of vested right 
was claimed on alleged representations made in 
Division VII of Part-1 of First Schedule to the 
Ordinance, 2001 regarding rates of tax till the tax 
year 2016 – fact noted in the paragraph 3 of the 
judgment. No such representation or promise 
allegedly extended was identified by the 
petitioner. There is no cavil that „proviso‟ 
provided scaffolding for the reasoning of the 
decision in the case of Anwar Yahya and 3 
others. (supra), but said proviso was omitted 
through the Finance Act 2014, hence, no 
protection could be claimed retrospectively. The 

W.P. No. 20679/2023. 
 
-:7:- 
 
 
 
 
controversy is not regarding withdrawal of vested 
rights but it is for the petitioner to demonstrate 
that how protection of proviso could be extended, 
after being omitted from the statute book. For 
facility of understanding, it is expedient to 
reproduce the then section 37A and proviso, as 
interpreted in the case of Anwar Yahya and 3 
others. (supra), which reads as, 
37A. Capital gain on sale of securities. – (1) The 
capital gain arising on or after the first day of July 
2010, from disposal of securities held for a period 
of less than a year, other than a gain that is exempt 
from tax under this Ordinance], shall be chargeable 
to tax at the rates specified in Division VII of Part I 
of the First Schedule: 
Provided that this section shall not apply if the 
securities are held for a period of more than a year 
And it is expedient to reproduce text of section 
37A, at the time of disposal of securities – during 
tax year 2023-, which reads as, 
37A. Capital gain on sale of securities. – (1) The 
capital gain arising on or after the first day of July 
2010, from disposal of securities, other than a gain 
that is exempt from tax under this Ordinance, shall 
be chargeable to tax at the rates specified in 
Division VII of Part I of the First Schedule: 
7. 
It is evident that no protection was available 
to the petitioner at the time of disposal of the 
securities 
– 
a 
triggering 
point 
for 
the 
determination of tax under section 37A of the 

W.P. No. 20679/2023. 
 
-:8:- 
 
 
 
 
Ordinance, 2001. In absence of the proviso to 
section 37A – omitted since 2014 – no question 
of inapplicability of section 37A arises. Learned 
counsel for the petitioner failed to show any 
statutory representation / promissory estoppel, 
allegedly extended before amendment was 
introduced in Division VII. No question of 
availability, let alone accrual of vested right, is 
made out. No inconsistency between section 37A 
of 
the 
Ordinance, 
2001 
and 
impugned 
amendment is found, since proviso to sub-section 
(1) of section 37A was earlier omitted through 
Finance Act 2014, and even the expression “held 
for a period of less than a year” appearing in 
section 37A of the Ordinance stood omitted 
through Finance Act 2015. It is reiterated that at 
the time of leviability of tax, for the purposes of 
gain tax accrued, no protection was available to 
support claim of any exemption or concession, 
whatsoever.  Case of Anwar Yahya and 3 others 
(supra) is not applicable. 
8. 
I now take up the objection against the 
constitutionality of first proviso to Division II. 
For reference and facility, Table qua rate of tax 
with impugned proviso is reproduced hereunder, 

W.P. No. 20679/2023.

Provided that for securities except at S. No.8 of the table, 
(i) 
The reduced rates of tax on capital gain 
arising on disposal shall apply where the 
securities are acquired on or after the first day 
of July, 2022; and  
 
(ii) 
the rate of 12.5% tax shall be charged on 
capital gain arising on disposal where the 
securities are acquired on or before the 30th 
day of June, 2022 irrespective of holding 
period of such securities: 
 
9. 
In terms of the proviso, added through the 
Finance Act 2022, the criterion for availing benefit of 
zero percent of rate of tax was made permissible, where 
holding period exceeds six years but condition of 
acquisition of securities on or after first day of July 
2002 was imposed. The period of holding of securities 
and date of acquisition for availing benefit of zero 

W.P. No. 20679/2023. 
 
-:10:- 
 
 
 
 
percent tax was prescribed. No vested right could be 
claimed against the right of the legislature to tax, when 
neither any vested right had conclusively accrued, nor 
subject matter transaction graduated to achieve status of 
a past and closed transaction. 
10. 
I find the plea of discrimination misconceived. 
Different rates of tax were provided against variously 
prescribed periods of holdings of securities, where each 
of the category manifest diverse periods. Such was the 
pattern of rates prescribed for different period of 
holdings since addition of section 37A from 2010. 
Provisioning of different slabs for retention of 
securities is not a novel or discriminatory practice. 
Categorization of slabs for holdings and prescribing 
rate of tax for each slab meets the criterion of providing 
intelligible 
differentia, 
distinguishing 
classes 
of 
securities held and varied retention period prescribed in 
the context of concession in rate of tax. Element of 
commonness amongst each category of securities held, 
root cause of discrimination, is conspicuous by its 
absence. Though there is no occasion to comment on 
the rational and efficacy of the policy, still ex-facie 
offering of discounted rates of tax regarding securities 
acquired on or after first day of July 2022 in fact 
encourages and incentivize the investment. This 
satisfies the test of proximity between rationality and 

W.P. No. 20679/2023. 
 
-:11:- 
 
 
 
 
objective intended to be achieved– encouraging roll-
over of securities / investment. Right to claim zero 
percent of tax on the securities acquired in 2011 cannot 
be recognized or granted perpetually. There is no cavil 
that legislature is otherwise competent to tax capital 
gains by changing the benchmark requirements, in 
absence of any promise made [which promise based on 
proviso to sub-section (1) of section 37A was omitted 
since 2014, – save past and closed transactions. 
Judgements referred are authorities decided in the 
context of the facts involved in each of those cases, 
which, in the context of facts involved, are 
distinguishable. No case for interference is made out.

Petition is found devoid of merits and same is,
