Mian Shahid Iqbal, Advocate for the petitioners. 
 
 
 
Through this revision-petition, filed under 
section 115 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 (the 
„Code‟), the following order passed by the learned 
Additional District Judge, Sillanwali, District Sargodha 
(the „appellate court‟) on 18.05.2023, has been assailed:- 
  “At the very outset learned counsel for 
appellants seeks an adjournment for ten/eleven 
days by saying that he is heart patient and has to 
proceed to Lahore for his medical treatment. He 
further submitted that on next date in case of his 
non-appearance, he will submit written arguments. 
The appeal is pending for the last more than three 
years and falls within the direction cases of three 
years old, however, for preserving ends of justice, 
request of learned counsel for appellants is 
accepted and adjournment is granted. Now to come 
up for final arguments coupled with arguments on 
application for permission to produce additional 
evidence for 29.05.2023.” 
 
 
2. 
Mian Shahid Iqbal, learned counsel for the 
revision-petitioners, has submitted that the appellate 
court has incorrectly fixed the application dated 
18.03.2023 filed under Order XLI Rule 27 of the Code 
(the „application‟) as well as the main appeal for 
arguments on the same day. He has submitted that there 
is an apprehension that while proceeding to decide the 
main appeal, the application shall be ignored and / or the 
guidelines given in case titled “Muhammad Umer versus 

               Civil Revision No.36424-2023 
 
2
Muhammad Qasim and another” (1991 SCMR 1232) 
shall be overlooked. Learned counsel for the revision-
petitioners has added that in view of law laid down by the 
Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in case reported 
as “Nestle Milkpak Limited versus Classic Needs 
Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd. and 3 others” (2006 SCMR 21) and 
by this Court in case reported as “Messrs Sheikh Goods 
Transport Company 
and others versus National 
Fertilizer Marketing Ltd.” (2022 MLD 121) the above 
reproduced order is a „case decided‟ as contemplated by 
section 115 of the Code.  
 
3. 
Arguments heard. Documents available on the 
file have been perused. 
 
4. 
Section 115 of the Code reads as follows:- 
Revision.  
(1) The High Court may call for the record of any 
case which has been decided by any Court 
subordinate to such High Court and in which no 
appeal lies thereto, and if such subordinate Court 
appear:- 
 (a) 
to have exercised a jurisdiction not 
vested in it by law, or 
 (b) 
to have failed to exercise a jurisdiction 
so vested, or 
 (c) 
to have acted in the exercise of its 
jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity, 
the High Court may make such order in the case 
as it thinks fit 
Provided that, where a person makes an 
application under this sub-section, he shall, in 
support of such application, furnish copies of the 
pleadings, 
documents 
and 
order 
of 
the 
subordinate Court and the High Court shall, 
except for reasons to be recorded, dispose of such 
application without calling for the record of the 
subordinate Court,  
 
Provided that such application shall be made 
within 90 days of the decision of the Subordinate 
Court  which shall provide a copy of such 
decision within 3-days thereof, and the High 

               Civil Revision No.36424-2023 
 
3
Court shall dispose of such application within six 
months.  
 (2) XXX 
  (3) XXX  
(4) XXX” 
 
 
 
                  (Underlining is added) 
 
Reading of above reflects that the revisional jurisdiction 
can be exercised when defects contemplated by the above 
provision are arising out of any case which has been 
decided. In the case titled “Messrs National Security 
Insurance Company Limited and others versus Messrs 
Hoechst Pakistan Limited and others” (1992 SCMR 718) 
the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan has already 
decided that the term any case which has been decided or 
„case decided‟ can be construed as decision in respect of 
any state of facts after judicially considering the same, 
though it is not required that this decision has disposed of 
the whole matter in the cause pending. In the case 
reported as “Mian Muhammad Luqman and 5 others 
versus Farida Khanam and another” (1994 SCMR 1991) 
the Supreme Court of Pakistan allowed the appeal against 
an order of this Court, when the revision-petition was 
maintained by this Court against an interlocutory order of 
the fora below, before final determination of an 
application for summoning expert. The following 
observations in aforesaid case are highly relevant:-  
 
“The petitioners/plaintiffs‟ side during 
the pendency of their suit for specific 
performance of contract applied for the 
summoning of a handwriting expert. This 
application, it has been assumed, was allowed 
by the order impugned before the High Court in 
its revisional jurisdiction. The nature of this 
order is such that prima facie it did not 
constitute “a case decided”. It was doubtful 
whether the application was at all allowed 
because the learned trial Judge had also 
observed that in the interest of justice the 

               Civil Revision No.36424-2023 
 
4
disputed writing and signatures be retained on 
the file with a view to comparison” either with 
a naked eye if the Court so required or to send 
the same for expert‟s examination.” Otherwise 
too it is doubtful whether in case an expert 
would have been summoned as prayed from 
the petitioner‟s side the order of summoning of 
expert would have constituted “a case 
decided”.”

5. 
 
In case titled “Umar Dad Khan and another 
versus Tila Muhammad Khan and 14 others” (PLD 1970 
Supreme Court 288) the scope of revision against 
interlocutory order was examined and it has been limited 
to the decisions that relate to some matter in controversy 
affecting the rights of the parties in view of the express 
and implied conditions necessary for the exercise of the 
revisional jurisdiction. It will be beneficial to reproduce 
the following extract from the said judgment:- 
 
“Firstly it had to be determined whether the 
order dated the 24th June 1966, was a „case 
decided‟ within section 115, C.P.C. The 
question as to when does an order passed 
during the trial of a suit constitute a „case 
decided‟ came up for examination before a Full 
Bench of seven Judges of the High Court of 
judicature at Lahore in Gurdevi v. Muhammad 
Bakhsh (1). Delivering the leading judgment 
Bhide, J. remarked:- 
 “I am inclined to think that the true test 
for 
deciding 
whether 
a 
particular 
interlocutory order should or should not 
be looked upon as a „case‟ for the purpose 
of section 115, C.P.C., is to be deduced not 
from the meaning of the word „case‟, but 
from the proper scope and limits of the 
revisional jurisdiction conferred upon the 
High Court by that section. From the 
standpoint of language, pure and simple, 
there seems to be no good reason why one 
branch of a suit should be held to be a 
„case‟ but not another and the word may 
include any interlocutory order. This does 
not, of course, mean that purely formal 
orders such as those relating to an 
adjournment or the summoning of a 
witness etc., could be looked upon as 

               Civil Revision No.36424-2023 
 
5
„cases‟. But when a decision relates to 
some matter in controversy affecting the 
rights of the parties, I do not see why it 
should not be looked upon as a „case‟. 
This wide interpretation of the word 
„case‟ is not, I think, likely to lead to 
inconvenience in practice as the field of 
interlocutory orders subject to revision 
will be extremely narrow in view of the 
express and implied conditions necessary 
for 
the 
exercise 
of 
the 
revisional 
jurisdiction. 
Theoretically 
the 
extraordinary jurisdiction is unlimited, 
but in practice it is held to be subject to 
important and well-recognized limits.” 
 
This is the correct statement of law and we are 
in complete accord with it. The order dated the 
24th June 1966, refusing to call for a further 
report from the Examiner of Questioned 
Documents was in this view not a „case 
decided‟ within the purview of section 115, 
C.P.C. to attract the revisional jurisdiction of 
the High Court. Secondly, orders from which no 
appeal is provided in Order, XLIII, rule 1, 
C.P.C., are intended by the Legislature to be 
final and not open to further interference by the 
High Court –See Venkatagiri v. H. R. E. Board, 
Madras (1).” 
 
 
 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
6. 
 
Examination of the relevant provision and 
the case law on the subject reveals that High Court should 
not too readily interfere with the interlocutory orders of 
the subordinate Court, unless express or implied 
conditions of clause „a‟, „b‟ and „c‟ of section 115(1) of 
the Code are involved and only those interlocutory orders 
do attract revisional jurisdiction that deals with some 
question in controversy before the Court or it has effect on 
rights of the parties to the lis. Baseless apprehensions or 
assumptions as to wrong exercise of jurisdiction or orders 
of 
adjournment 
or 
orders 
fixing 
the 
case 
for       
arguments, certainly do not fall within the scope of    
„case decided‟ to maintain revision-petition under   
section 115 of the Code. Mian Shahid Iqbal- learned 

               Civil Revision No.36424-2023

counsel relied upon “Nestle Milkpak Limited” case 
(supra), however, the decision of the case, as matter of 
fact goes against the interest of the present revision-
petitioners. The Honourble Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
the said case has observed that in order to avail remedy 
under section 115 of the Code the order assailed should 
qualify the test of „case decided‟ and normally a revision 
petition against the interim order is not maintainable. It 
has been observed that the provision is attracted only 
when the interim order is passed after considering the 
facts and then it is found perverse or suffers from 
jurisdictional defect. The reliance of the learned counsel 
on “Messrs Sheikh Goods Transport Company and 
others” case (supra) is equally misplaced. The order 
assailed in the said revision-petition was a final decision 
of refusal to permit evidence. 
 
7. 
 
Even otherwise, the reliance of Mian Shahid 
Iqbal-learned ASC on “Muhammad Umer” case (supra), 
to justify that the apprehension of wrong exercise of 
jurisdiction by the learned appellate court, is not 
acceptable in view of the following observations of the 
Supreme Court in the case titled “Sultan Ali alias Sultan 
through L.Rs and others versus Rasheed Ahmad and 45 
others”(2005 SCMR 1444):- 
“The High Court has not decided the appeal on 
merits and has accepted it only on the ground 
that the First Appellate Court acted illegally in 
deciding the respondents‟ application for the 
permission to produce additional evidence under 
Order XLI, rule, 27, C.P.C. along with the main 
appeal. It has been held that this procedure 
adopted by the First Appellate Court was not 
sustainable keeping in view the law as declared 
by this Court in the judgment reported as 
Muhammad Umar v. Muhammad Qasim (supra). 
We are afraid that the view expressed by the 
learned Judge in Chambers of the Lahore High 
Court is incorrect. No such law has been 

               Civil Revision No.36424-2023 
 
7
declared by this Court that in every case the 
Court has to decide the application for 
permission to adduce additional evidence prior 
to the decision of the main appeal through 
separate orders and cannot give a composite 
judgment. In Muhammad „Umar‟s case (supra) 
the Appellate Court had dismissed the appeal 
without deciding the application under Order 
XLI, rule 27, C.P.C. and in this background the 
case was remanded by holding that the 
application under Order XLI, rule 27, C.P.C. 
ought to have been adjudicated upon before 
disposing of the appeal and the words “before 
disposing of the appeal” employed by this Court 
in the said judgment did not and do not mean 
that the same cannot be done by the Court seized 
of the matter, in the same judgment. In the case 
in hand the First Appellate Court in paras.5 of 
its judgment, had given reasons in detail for 
dismissing the application for producing the 
additional evidence and thereafter proceeded to 
dismiss the appeal on merits. The procedure 
adopted by the First Appellate Court did not 
suffer from any illegality and was in accordance 
with the procedural law and the law as settled by 
the superior Courts of this Country.” 
 
 
 
 
         (Underlining is added) 
 
 
8. 
For what has been discussed above, I am of 
the firm opinion that the order assailed before this Court is 
not a „case decided‟. Resultantly, the instant civil-revision 
is dismissed in limine being not maintainable. No order as 
to costs.
