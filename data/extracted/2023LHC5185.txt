AHMAD NADEEM ARSHAD, J.  This Civil Revision as 
well as Civil Revision No.1178 of 2022 are directed against the same 
judgment/order dated 18.10.2022 of the learned Appellate Court, 
therefore, the same are being decided together through instant 
judgment. 
2. 
Facts in brevity are that Mst. Sara Akhtar (hereinafter referred 
to as petitioner) instituted a suit for declaration and permanent 
injunction against Mehmood Khan etc. (hereinafter referred to as 
respondents). Respondents contested the suit by filing written 
statement in contrast. Learned Trial Court, after full-fledged trial 
decreed the suit vide judgment & decree dated 28.06.2019 and 
directed the Revenue Officer to incorporate the mutation after 
cancellation of mutations impugned in the suit. Said decree remained 
intact upto this Court. Thereafter, the petitioner filed an execution 
petition for recovery of possession through warrant of possession. 
Respondents challenged the validity of said execution petition.

C.R. No.1178 of 2022.

Learned Executing Court, after providing an opportunity of hearing 
to the parties, dismissed the execution petition vide order dated 
29.06.2022. Feeling aggrieved, the petitioner preferred an appeal 
which was allowed vide order dated 18.10.2022 with the direction to 
the learned Executing Court to proceed further in accordance with 
the procedure laid down in order XXI Rule 35(2) of the Code of 
Civil Procedure, 1908. Being dissatisfied, both parties approached 
this Court through their independent Civil Revisions.  
3. 
Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner 
maintains that impugned order of the Appellate Court dated 
18.10.2022 to the extent of constructive possession instead of 
physical possession is illegal, perverse and based upon surmises and 
conjectures. He adds that in the light of decree in favour of the 
petitioner, she is entitled to the physical possession of the suit 
property, hence, by accepting this petition learned Executing Court 
be directed to proceed further for handing over physical possession 
of the suit property to the petitioner. To augment his arguments, he 
relied upon case laws cited as “TAJ WALI SHAH V. BAKHTI 
ZAMAN (2019 SCMR 84) AND MARGRETE WILLIAM V. ABDUL 
HAMID MIAN (1994 SCMR 1555).”    
4. 
On the other hand, learned counsel appearing on behalf of 
respondents attacked the impugned order dated 18.10.2022 by 
maintaining that the same is against the facts & law and result of 
mis-reading/non-reading of record. Further submit that learned 
Executing Court rightly dismissed the execution petition but the 
learned Appellate Court upset the said judgment on flimsy grounds. 
In last, they prayed for acceptance of their petition, dismissal of the 
execution petition of petitioner and setting aside the order dated 
18.10.2022.  
5.  
I have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and 
perused the record with their able assistance.  
6. 
Petitioner instituted the suit for declaration and permanent 
injunction whereby she sought declaration to the effect that she is 

C.R. No. 1376  of 2022. 
C.R. No.1178 of 2022.

owner in possession of the suit property and assailed the validity and 
legality of mutations No.30, 31, 32, 33, 37 & 38 dated 16.01.1989 on 
the ground of fraud and mis-representation, having no effect upon 
her rights and liable to be set-aside. Learned Trial Court decreed the 
suit vide judgment & decree dated 28.06.2019. Said judgment & 
decree of the learned Trial Court was upheld by the Appellate Court 
as well as this Court, hence, the Revenue Officer in the light of 
direction given in the said decree sanctioned the mutation No.3076 
in favour of the petitioner after cancelling the mutations challenged 
in the suit. Thereafter, petitioner filed an execution petition for 
getting the possession of the suit property. 
7. 
Respondents raised an objection with regard to the 
maintainability of the said execution petition. Learned Executing 
Court, while dealing with the question of maintainability, dismissed 
the execution petition vide order dated 29.06.2022 in the following 
manner: 
“Now it is to see whether or not the decree-holder/plaintiff can be 
put in physical possession of the suit property. Admittedly, the 
plaintiff/decree-holder is not the sole owner of the suit khatas’ and 
she is co-owner of the joint property. By virtue of judgment & 
decree, she was not held entitled to be the owner as well as 
possessor of any specific portion of the joint suit property, 
therefore she cannot be put into possession in any specific portion 
of the joint suit property because the law is very much clear on this 
point that unless and until a joint property is not legally 
partitioned, each and every co-owner is considered as owner in 
possession in each and every inch of the joint suit property. The 
court while passing the decree in favour of the plaintiff/decree 
holder has declared the applicant/decree holder as owner and 
constructive possessor over the suit property which means that the 
plaintiff/decree holder is in a symbolic possession of the suit 
property. In compliance with the decree, the mutation of suit 
property has already been sanctioned in favour of the 
plaintiff/decree holder, therefore the decree has been fully satisfied. 
Resultantly, the instant execution petition is no more proceed able, 
hence, the same is dismissed and is consigned to the record room 
after its due completion and compilation.   
 
Learned Appellate Court allowed the appeal preferred against 
judgment/order of Executing Court in the following terms: 
“I have minutely gone through the impugned order dated 
29.06.2022 of the learned trial court, wherein instead of adopting 
the procedure envisaged in order 21 rule 35(2) of CPC and issuing 

C.R. No. 1376  of 2022. 
C.R. No.1178 of 2022.  
4
of warrant of possession, learned executing court has rather 
hastily dismissed the execution petition, which is neither proper 
nor legally tenable, by any stretch of imagination. In sequel of the 
above, while accepting instant appeal, impugned order dated 
29.06.2022 of the learned executing court is set aside and 
execution proceedings are restored accordingly, with the direction 
to the learned executing court to proceed strictly in accordance 
with the procedure laid down in Order 21 Rule 35(2) of CPC.”

Petitioner in her suit for declaration and permanent injunction 
prayed as under:

Petitioner sought declaration with regard to her ownership and 
possession over the suit property. Learned Trial Court, while 
decreeing her suit observed that she is owner and in constructive 
possession over the suit properties and declared as under: 
“Net result of above mentioned discussion is that suit of the 
plaintiff namely Sara Akhtar d/o Akhtar Hameed Ghouri for 
declaratory relief above her ownership and possession is hereby 
decreed declaring her owner and constructive possessor over the 
following suit property:-

The suit of the plaintiff also decreed declaring mutations No.30, 31, 
32, 33, 37 & 38 relating to the suit property belonging to plaintiff 
null and void against facts and law as beneficiaries of these 
mutations miserably failed to prove genuineness of transaction of 
sale mentioned in mutations under challenge. A copy of this 
judgment be sent to the concerned revenue officer for making fresh 
entries accordingly.”  
11. 
Despite satisfaction of the decree with regard to the injunction 
as the Revenue Officer sanctioned the mutation No.3076, the 
petitioner filed execution petition for recovery of possession. The 
grievance of the petitioner is that she sought recovery of possession 
of the suit property but the learned Executing Court dismissed her 
execution petition, whereas, the learned Appellate Court merely 
directed the learned Executing Court to proceed in accordance with 
the procedure laid down in Order XXI Rule 35(2) of the Code of 
Civil Procedure, which only provides delivery of symbolic 
possession instead of actual possession.  
12. 
It is evidence from the record that through mutations 
impugned in the suit 4000/25367 share in Khata No.16 measuring 
200 Kanals, 4000/15645 share in Khata No.18 measuring 200 Kanals, 
4000/25367 share in Khata No.16 measuring 200 Kanals, 
2759/15645 share in Khata No.18 measruing 137 Kanals & 19 
Marlas, 4000/10400 share in Khata No.345 measuring 200 Kanals 
and 800/8000 share in Khata No.344 measuring 40 Kanals have been 
shown to be transferred to the respondents from petitioner. Neither 
any specific Khasra numbers nor any specific portion of land was 
transferred to the respondents. It is also matter of record that 
petitioner is owner in the joint Khatas and not holding possession 
over any specific Khasra numbers. Keeping in view revenue record 
and facts & circumstances of the case, the learned Trial Court 
awarded decree of declaration while declaring her owner in 
constructive possession of the said Khatas and also awarded decree 
of injunction by sending the copy of judgment to the concerned 
Revenue Officer for making fresh entries accordingly. The Revenue 
Officer, after cancellation of the mutations impugned in the suit, 

C.R. No. 1376  of 2022. 
C.R. No.1178 of 2022.  
6
sanctioned fresh mutation in favour of the petitioner and in this way 
decree has been complied with.  
13. 
Petitioner got a decree of declaration which could not be 
enforced through filing an execution petition. The decree passed in a 
suit for declaration did not create or confer a new right but the same 
would declare a pre-existing right. Any person entitled to any legal 
character, or to any right as to any property may institute a suit 
against any person denying, or interested to deny his title to such 
character or right and the Court may in its discretion make a 
declaration that he is so entitled.  
14. 
The petitioner was co-sharer in the joint Khatas before 
sanction of the mutations impugned in the suit. After getting decree 
of declaration she again got her previous status. According to law, 
possession of one co-sharer is always considered to be possession on 
behalf of all co-sharers. Co-sharer having possession even on the 
fractional share of the joint land has a right, title and interest in every 
part of the joint land till such land stands partitioned by metes and 
bounds in accordance with law. The petitioner knew well her status 
in the said Khata, therefore, she instituted only suit for declaration 
and sought declaration of her status over the suit property as owner 
in possession and did not seek any relief with regard to recovery of 
possession of any specific Khara numbers. After getting decree of 
declaration, she became owner in possession of the suit property 
situated in joint Khata, therefore, her possession against the 
respondents is absolute and final but with regard to other 
shareholders is constructive and symbolic until partition takes place. 
Therefore, she did not seek recovery of possession of any specific 
Khasra numbers or specific portion in her execution petition and 
prayed as under:

15. 
The learned Executing Court rightly dismissed the execution 
petition but the learned Appellate Court erred in law while setting-
aside the said order of Executing Court and directed to proceed in 
accordance with the procedure laid down in Order XXI Rule 35(2) of 
the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. The said provision deals with a 
situation where a decree of joint possession of immoveable property 
has been passed, which reads as under: 
“(2) Where a decree is for the joint possession of 
immoveable property, such possession shall be delivered by 
affixing a copy of the warrant in some conspicuous place on 
the property and proclaiming by beat of drum, or other 
customary mode, at some convenient place, the substance of 
the decree.”  
16. 
The petitioner sought implementation of the decree which is 
purely a declaratory one declaring her title in the suit property with 
consequential relief of perpetual injunction by directing the 
concerned Revenue Officer to make fresh entries. A decree sought to 
be executed should be capable of execution i.e. it should order the 
doing of an act or restrain the doing of an act. First portion of the 
decree is purely declaratory and as such cannot be executed. 
However, second portion thereof provides direction of doing an act 
and said part has been complied with by the Revenue Officer by 
sanctioning mutation in favour of the petitioner. It is settled law that 
a decree is to be executed by the Executing Court in accordance with 
its terms and conditions without modification. In the instant case 
neither petitioner prayed for recovery of any possession/joint 
possession of immoveable property nor any decree was passed in this 
regard. Hence, learned Appellate Court has erred in law while setting 
aside the order of learned Executing Court. Impugned order of the 
Appellate Court dated 18.10.2022 is against the facts & law, hence, 
the same is not sustainable. So far as the case laws referred to by 
learned counsel for the petitioner are concerned, it is observed that 

C.R. No. 1376  of 2022. 
C.R. No.1178 of 2022.

the same are not helpful to the petitioner being distinguishable from 
the facts & circumstances of the case in hand.  
17. 
For the foregoing reasons, the revision petition (C.R. No.1376 
of 2022) filed by the petitioner Sara Akhtar has no force, hence, the 
same is dismissed accordingly, while the connected revision petition 
filed by the respondents Mehmood Khan etc. (C.R. No.1178 of 2022) 
is allowed. Consequently, impugned judgment/order of learned 
Appellate Court dated 18.10.2022 is set-aside and the order dated 
29.06.2022 passed by learned Executing Court is restored. No order 
as to costs.
