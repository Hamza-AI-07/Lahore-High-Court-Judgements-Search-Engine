2. 
Brief however necessary facts for deciding instant petition are that 
Muhammad Aslam (present petitioner) filed application (copy whereof is 
available at Page No.10 as Annex-A of the petition) before Director Anti-
Corruption Establishment Lahore Region Lahore for registration of the case 
against Muhammad Bashir, Patwari (now arrayed as respondent No.4 in the 
instant petition); inquiry was conducted and it was concluded in the same that 
allegations levelled against Muhammad Bashir (Patwari) have been found correct 
and registration of case against him was recommended (copy of report is available 
at Page No.11 to 13 as Annex-B of the petition); thereafter case was registered 
vide F.I.R. No.24/2019 dated: 31.12.2019 under Section: 5 2(47) of the Prevention 
of Corruption Act read with Section: 161 PPC at Police Station: Anti-Corruption, 
District: Kasur (copy whereof is available at Page No.16 as Annex-D of the 
petition); cancellation report was prepared in said case on 05.09.2020 by Circle 
Officer, Anti-Corruption Establishment, Kasur while mentioning therein that 
complainant is neither himself joining investigation nor producing his witnesses, 
therefore, case is recommended for droppage (copy of said report is available at 
Page No.17 as Annex-E of the petition) which was submitted before Senior 
Special Judge, Anti-Corruption Punjab, Lahore. However, same was not 
approved/agreed by Senior Special Judge, Anti-Corruption Punjab, Lahore vide 
order dated: 13.10.2020 and file was returned to Director Anti-Corruption 
Establishment, Lahore for re-investigation under Section: 5(6) of the Criminal 
Law Amendment Act, 1958 (copy of said order is available at Page No.18-19 as 
Annex-F of the petition); relevant portion of the order is reproduced:- 
 
“4. 
Not a single document showing any serious effort 
made by CO ACE Kasur to summon complainant and his 
witnesses is available on record to substantiate the reasons 
for recommendation to drop the proceedings. Investigating 
Agency should not feel itself so powerless and helpless while 
summoning complainant and witnesses. It should bring all 
its resources into action to procure the attendance of 
witnesses and all such record, should be made part of the 
file. ACE has not probed into the matter in professional 
manner. Reasons mentioned to drop the proceedings are not 
convincing to a judicial mind, therefore, file is returned to 
Director Anti-Corruption Establishment Lahore Region 
Lahore for re-investigation u/s 5(6) of the Criminal Law 
Amendment Act, 1958.” 
 

Writ Petition No.670  of 2023       
 
 
 
 
           3 
 
Then again cancellation report in the case was prepared on 13.12.2021 by Circle 
Officer Headquarter/Anti-Corruption Establishment Region-B, Lahore (copy 
whereof is available at Page No.20-21 as Annex-G of the petition) which was 
agreed by Special Judge, Anti-Corruption, Lahore vide impugned order dated: 
06.04.2022 (copy whereof is available at Page No.22 as Annex-H of the petition); 
relevant portion of the order is hereby reproduced:- 
 
“2. 
Record shows that ACE has recommended droppage 
of this case due to non-prosecution and non-producing 
evidence of the complainant against accused as the same 
was disagreed in the first round of investigation so in the 
circumstances when no one is coming to pursue his case and 
not producing evidence in the second round of investigation 
so there is no need to any interference. In view of above, I 
agree with the instant cancellation report prepared by CO, 
ACE Lahore Region-B, Lahore. File be consigned to the 
record room after its due completion.” 
 
3.  
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that impugned order has been 
passed against the law and facts of the case; further adds that any serious attempt 
was never made for joining the complainant as well as witnesses in the process of 
investigation; also adds that matter was never investigated on merits rather merely 
on the basis of non-joining of investigation by the complainant/witnesses, 
cancellation report was prepared and same has been agreed even without hearing 
the petitioner; finally prays for setting aside the impugned order. 
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent No.4 
submits that inspite of issuing notices to the complainant about seven times during 
investigation, complainant neither himself appeared nor produced his witnesses in 
support of allegations levelled by him in the case; further adds that Special Judge 
Anti-Corruption, Lahore was having jurisdiction to pass the order, therefore, 
instant petition is not maintainable; finally prays for dismissal of this petition. 
3. 
Learned Assistant Advocate General Punjab assisted by Deputy Director 
(Prosecution), Anti-Corruption Establishment, Lahore and after himself going 
through the available record submits that first cancellation report was prepared for 
the  reason that complainant and witnesses did not join the investigation and even 
second time cancellation report was prepared for the same reason that they have 
not joined the investigation, however, at both the occasions the allegation levelled 
in the case was not investigated on merits and veracity/genuineness of the 

Writ Petition No.670  of 2023       
 
 
 
 
           4 
 
allegation levelled in the case was not thrashed out; further submits that any 
warrants of arrest as well as proclamation for procuring the attendance of the 
complainant as well as witnesses were never issued in this case; also submits that 
even in anti-corruption cases, for the purpose of summoning the witnesses during 
investigation, separate rules have not been framed and procedure available in 
Punjab Police Rules and in Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898  is to be adopted. 
4.   
After hearing learned counsel for the parties, learned Assistant Advocate 
General Punjab assisted by Deputy Director (Prosecution), Anti-Corruption 
Establishment, Lahore and going through the available record, it has been noticed 
that the petitioner moved application to the Director Anti-Corruption 
Establishment, Lahore for registration of the case upon which inquiry was 
conducted and it was concluded in the same that allegations levelled against 
Muhammad Bashir Patwari/respondent No.4 have been found correct and 
registration of case was recommended against Muhammad Bashir Patwari; 
thereafter case was registered vide F.I.R. No.24/2019 dated: 31.12.2019 under 
Section: 5 2(47) of the Prevention of Corruption Act read with Section: 161 PPC 
at Police Station: Anti-Corruption, District: Kasur. After registration of the case, 
investigation was to be conducted and though for the purpose of summoning 
witnesses and compelling the production of documents and the penalty for 
disobeying, or evading the same, in addition to or substitution of the provisions of 
the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, rules were to be framed to carry out the 
purpose of the Pakistan Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1958 and Section: 12 of 
the ibid Act is reproduced:- 
“12. Power 
to 
make 
rules—(1) 
The 
appropriate 
Government may frame rules to carry out the purposes of this 
Act. 
(2) 
In particular, and without prejudice to the generality 
of the foregoing powers, such rules may provide for any of 
the following matters, namely:- 
(a) 
Authorization of person to exercise the power to 
sanction 
persecution 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
appropriate Government in respect of various 
grades of public servants. 
(b) 
The emoluments of the Special Judges, and 
their appointment;  
(c) 
Territorial limits of the jurisdiction of Special 
Judges and the place and time of sitting of the 
Courts presided over by the Special Judges. 
(d) 
The summoning of witnesses and compelling the 
production of documents and the penalty for 
disobeying, or evading the same, in addition to 

Writ Petition No.670  of 2023       
 
 
 
 
           5 
 
or substitution of the provisions of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1898. 
(e) 
Matters incidental to the above.” 
 
yet till now no separate rules on the subject i.e. as required under Section: 12(2)(d) 
of the ibid Act have not been framed and rule No.14 of the Punjab Anti-
Corruption Establishment Rules, 2014 only speaks about application of the Punjab 
Police Rules, which reads as under:- 
“14. Application of the Punjab Police Rules.- The 
Establishment shall, as far as may be, follow the provisions 
of the Punjab Police Rules for the time being in force for 
purposes of inquiry and investigation of offences specified in 
the Schedule.” 
 
 
hence investigation in the case was to be carried out in the manner as provided in 
Punjab Police Rules as well as Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (hereinafter 
referred to as “Code”), therefore, it was necessary for the investigating officer to 
firstly issue notice under Section: 160 of Code for summoning complainant as 
well as witnesses for joining investigation and if same remained ineffective then 
to get issued warrants for their arrest in the shape of Form No.VII as provided in 
Schedule-V and under Section: 90 of the Code and for ready reference same is 
hereby scanned below:- 
 
 
 
and if it was also going to be remained as unsuccessful then to get issued 
proclamation requiring attendance of the complainant as well as witnesses, as per 
Form No.V provided in Schedule-V under Section: 87 of the Code and same is 
hereby scanned below:- 
 

Writ Petition No.670  of 2023       
 
 
 
 
           6 
 
 
and if even said exercise was going to be failed then to get issued the order of 
attachment to compel the attendance of complainant and witnesses as provided 
under Section: 88 through Form No.VI provided in Schedule-V of the Code and 
same is hereby scanned below:- 
 
Aforementioned are the mandatory provisions of law to be complied with for the 
purpose of procuring presence of complainant as well as witnesses and spirit 
behind this legislation was to adopt each and every mode for procuring presence 
of persons concerned for the purpose of investigation because thrashing out the 
veracity of allegations levelled in the crime report (first information report) 
through collecting relevant evidence during the process of investigation in order to 
conclude that allegation has been established or not is the basic purpose of fair 
investigation and in this regard rule No.10 of the Punjab Anti-Corruption 
Establishment Rules, 2014 can be referred, which is hereby reproduced:- 
“Dropping of case or reference for departmental action.- (1) 
The following procedure shall be followed for dropping a 
case or, as the case may be, recommending disciplinary 
action: 
(a) on 
completion 
of 
investigation, 
if 
the 
allegations are not established, the case shall 
be dropped and intimation to that effect shall be 
sent to the concerned administrative department 
and the public servant; and  
(b) if after investigation, it is found that judicial 
action is not warranted but reasonable evidence 

Writ Petition No.670  of 2023       
 
 
 
 
           7 
 
is available to initiate disciplinary action 
against the public servant, the Establishment 
shall, after the confirmation of the cancellation 
report by the concerned court, refer the matter 
to the competent authority for initiation of such 
action in accordance with law for the time in 
force. 
(2)      The authorities competent to pass an order for 
purposes 
of 
dropping 
a 
case 
or 
recommending 
disciplinary action in terms of sub-rule(1) shall be as 
under:- 
(a) Director, in case of public servants upto BPS-
17; 
(b) Director-General, in case of public servants 
upto BPS-18; 
(c) Additional Chief Secretary, for public servants 
in BPS-19 except those mentioned in clause (e); 
(d) Chief Secretary, in case of public servants in 
BPS-20, except those mentioned in clause (e); 
and 
(e) Chief Minister, in case of District Coordination 
Officers, 
Commissioners 
of 
Divisions, 
Administrative Secretaries and other officers in 
BPS-21 and above. 
(3)      The Establishment shall forward the facts of the 
case, draft charge sheet, list of witnesses and documents, 
if any, to the competent authority for initiation of 
disciplinary proceedings. 
(4)    On receipt of a reference for disciplinary 
proceedings, the competent authority shall initiate such 
proceedings in accordance with the law for the time being 
in force. 
(5)   The competent authority shall promptly convey to the 
Establishment the final order passed in the disciplinary 
proceedings alongwith a copy of the inquiry report. 
(6)      Copies of final report of the cases dropped shall not 
be supplied to anyone without the prior permission in 
writing of the Director at the Region and the Director 
General at the Headquarters.” 
(emphasis added) 
 
By now it is well settled that fair investigation is mandatory for the fair trial which 
has been now guaranteed by Article 10-A of the Constitution of Islamic Republic 
of Pakistan, 1973; in this regard, guidance has been sought from the case of 
“Bank of Punjab and another versus Haris Steel Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. and 
others” (PLD 2010 SC 1109) and relevant portion from Page No.1136 of the 
same is as under:- 
“30. …………..Needless to say that it is evidence and 
evidence alone which could lead a court of law to a just and 
fair conclusion about the guilt or innocence of an accused 
person. It is, therefore, only an honest investigation which 
could guarantee a fair trial and conceiving a fair trial in the 

Writ Petition No.670  of 2023       
 
 
 
 
           8 
 
absence of an impartial and a just investigation would be a 
mere illusion and a mirage. It is, hence, only a fair 
investigation which could assure a fair trial and thus any 
act which ensures a clean investigation which is above 
board, is an act in aid of securing the said guaranteed right 
and not in derogation thereof. ……” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis added) 
 
Case of “Afzal Ahmad versus City Police Officer, Faisalabad and 3 others” 
(PLD 2022 Lahore 721) can also be safely referred on the subject; relevant 
portion from the same is reproduced:- 
 
“7. 
Fair investigation is concomitant to the right to fair 
trial guaranteed under Article 10A of the Constitution. In 
Babubhai v. State of Gujrat and others [2010) 12 SCC 254] 
the Supreme Court of India held that it is also a part of 
right to life and personal liberty and that “investigation 
must be fair, transparent and judicious as it is the minimum 
requirement of rule of law.” ……….”  
 
 
 
 
The purpose of investigation is to dig out the truth and to bring it before the court 
of justice otherwise ultimately it causes harm to fair trial;  in this regard, case of 
“Saira Fatima Sadozai versus D.I.G. Investigation and others” (2023 PCr.LJ 
427) can be safely referred and relevant portion of the same is hereby 
reproduced:- 
 
“Purpose of “investigation” is to dig out the truth 
regarding crime/occurrence and put up the same before the 
Court. Investigating Officer has to collect entire relevant 
facts of the occurrence irrespective of the fact that such facts 
favour prosecution or accused; he is under obligation to 
collect the evidence honestly, justly and fairly for bringing 
the truth on record not only to build up the case of 
complainant with evidence enabling the Court to record 
conviction but also for reaching to a just and fair decision. If 
investigation is not conducted on merits then ultimately it 
causes frightful harm to the concept of fair trial 
guaranteed by Article 10-A of the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973.” 
(emphasis added) 
 
Rule 25.2(3) of the Police Rules, 1934 provides that it is the duty of investigating 
officer to dig out the truth and bring it before the court of justice, same is hereby 
reproduced for ready reference:- 
“25.2 Power of investigating officers: 
(1)….. 
(2)….. 

Writ Petition No.670  of 2023       
 
 
 
 
           9 
 
 
(3) 
It is the duty of an investigating officer to find out the 
truth of the matter under investigation. His object shall be to 
discover the actual facts of the case and to arrest the real 
offender or offenders. He shall not commit himself 
prematurely to any view of the facts for or against any 
person.” 
 
It is admitted fact and even not denied by any party that this case was never 
investigated on merits i.e. veracity of allegations levelled in the same were not 
thrashed out by digging out the truth and required evidence has not been collected 
under Section: 4(1)(l) of the Code inspite of the fact that first cancellation report 
was returned vide order dated: 13.10.2020 by the Senior Special Judge Anti-
Corruption for re-investigation i.e. collecting evidence but at both occasions 
cancellation reports were prepared merely on the basis of non-joining of 
investigation by complainant and witnesses, however it was not mentioned in both 
cancellation reports that for procuring attendance of complainant and witnesses, 
warrants of their arrest, proclamation and order of attachment against them were 
got issued so said cancellation reports were prepared without fulfilling mandatory 
requirements for procuring attendance of complainant and witnesses; furthermore, 
as per rule No.10(1)(a) of the Punjab Anti-Corruption Establishment Rules, 2014, 
case can be dropped if on “completion” of investigation, allegations are not 
established but in this case, what to speak of completion of investigation, 
practically speaking, it could not be carried out to conclude that allegation was 
established or not because it is own case of investigating agency that complainant 
and witnesses did not join investigation, hence said reports were defective and it 
goes without saying that when law requires a thing to be done in a particular 
manner, it should have been done in that manner otherwise same would be 
deemed as illegal in the light of maxim “A communi observantia non est 
recedendum” and in this regard case of “Muhammad Zafar Iqbal versus 
Sadozai Khan and two others” (2021 YLR 1206) and case of “Maqsood 
Yameen versus R.P.O. Multan and others” (2015 PCr.LJ 923) can be referred. 
Needless to add that law does not favour knocking out any one on technical grounds 
rather decision on merits. Since, cancellation reports in the case were prepared without 
concluding that allegation levelled in the case has been established or not but merely on 
the ground that complainant and witnesses did not join investigation however not 
mentioning in the reports that process for compelling their attendance through warrants, 

Writ Petition No.670  of 2023       
 
 
 
 
           10 
 
proclamation and attachment was got issued and also not annexing any proof in 
this regard, and impugned order dated: 06.04.2022 has been passed by Special 
Judge, Anti-Corruption, Lahore without taking into consideration above said 
important aspect, hence, impugned order is not sustainable and hereby set-aside; 
matter is remanded to Special Judge, Anti-Corruption Punjab, Lahore where 
second cancellation report prepared by Circle Officer, Anti-Corruption 
Establishment, Kasur will be deemed as pending and same would be re-decided 
through fresh and speaking order within a period of 30-days after receipt of 
attested copy of this judgment strictly in accordance with law. Parties will appear 
before said court on 25.05.2023. It goes without saying that it has been apprised 
by learned Assistant Advocate General assisted by Deputy Director (Prosecution), 
Anti-Corruption Department that rules for procedure regarding summoning of 
witnesses, documents and penalty for disobeying the same, in addition to or 
substitution of the provisions of the “Code” has not been framed, therefore, 
Registrar of this Court shall send copy of the judgment to Chief Secretary Punjab 
for bringing this state of affairs in the notice/knowledge of all concerned quarters.
