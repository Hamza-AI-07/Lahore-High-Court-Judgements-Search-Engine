M/s Inam-ur-Rehiem, Basit Khan Tanoli and 
Waheed Akhtar, Advocates for the Petitioner. 
Malik Muhammad Siddique Awan, Additional 
Attorney General with Arshad Mehmood Malik, 
Assistant Attorney General with Lt. Col. Haider 
Sultan, Law, DTE, G.H.Q. 
 
 
The Petitioner has invoked the constitutional 
jurisdiction of this Court under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the 
“Constitution”) with the following prayers: 
i. 
The respondents be directed to produce 
the petitioner’s husband Brigadier 
Akhtar Subhan, safe and sound before 
this Court, who on production, be dealt 
with in accordance with law and the 
Constitution”. 
ii. 
Hold and declare that the arrest and 
detention of petitioner’s husband is 
illegal and in violation of the service 
rules. 
iii. 
The respondents be directed to disclose 
the charge (if any, in terms of Rule 23 
and 24 of the Pakistan Army Act Rules, 
1957) if pending against the detenue 
before this Hon’ble Court. 
 
2. 
The sole grievance of the Petitioner is that her 
husband has been taken into custody unlawfully by the 
Respondents who are not even permitting her to meet him.  

W.P.No.2901 of 2023

3. 
Learned Additional Attorney General filed reply and 
objected to maintainability of the petition on the 
touchstone of Article 199(3) and Article 8(3) of the 
“Constitution”. It has been stated that the Petitioner’s 
husband is a serving army officer therefore, he is subject to 
Pakistan Army Act, 1952 (the “Act”). It has further been 
stated that Petitioner’s husband was arrested in terms of 
Section 73 of the “Act” and is being investigated by the 
military authorities under Section 2(1)(a) of the “Act”.  
4. 
Heard. 
5. 
Learned Additional Attorney General and Lt. Col. 
Haider Sultan, Law, DTE, G.H.Q. have referred to the 
reply dated 22.09.2023 and submitted in line therewith that 
instant petition is not maintainable on score that the 
Petitioner’s husband is under legal and lawful custody of 
military authorities in connection with investigation 
underway under the “Act”. When this aspect of the matter 
was confronted to learned counsel for the Petitioner, he 
pointed out that the Petitioner was given access to meet her 
husband yesterday.  
6. 
Admittedly, the Petitioner is serving commissioned 
officer 
(PA-33025, 
Brigadier) 
of 
Pakistan 
Army 
performing his duties under the control of Federal 
Government Ministry of Defence and is subject to the 
“Act”. Article 199(3) of the “Constitution” clearly bars 
the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 199(1)(b) to 
resolve the matters involved in this petition. The scope of 
constitutional jurisdiction in matters relating to Article 
199(3) of “Constitution” is very limited. The Hon’ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “SAID ZAMAN 
KHAN and others Versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN 
through Secretary Ministry of Defence and others”  
(2017 SCMR 1249), while outlining the scope of Article 
199(3) held as under:- 

W.P.No.2901 of 2023  
 
 
 
 
 
 
3 
“70. In the proceedings culminating in the 
impugned Judgments/Orders, the jurisdiction 
of the learned High Courts under Article 199 
of the Constitution, had been invoked. The 
said Article contains a non obstantive 
provision i.e. sub-Article (3) thereof, which 
reads as under: 
"(3) An order shall not be made under 
clause (1) on application made by or 
in relation to a person who is a 
member of the Armed Forces of 
Pakistan, or who is for the time being 
subject to any law relating to any of 
those Forces, in respect of his terms 
and conditions of service, in respect of 
any matter arising out of his service, 
or in respect of any action taken in 
relation to him as a member of the 
Armed Forces of Pakistan or as a 
person subject to such law." 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
7. 
A bare perusal of the aforesaid provision would 
suggest that prima facie a High Court in exercise of its 
jurisdiction under Article 199(3) of the “Constitution” 
cannot pass any order in respect of any person who even 
for the time being is subject to any law pertaining to the 
Armed Forces with regard to any action taken under such 
law. The Pakistan Army Act, 1952, is one of the laws 
applicable to the Armed Forces of Pakistan. It is noted that 
this Court has already dismissed a writ petition 
(W.P.No.1459 of 2017) vide dated 11.03.2019 with the 
following observations: 
“The matter agitated, is hit by Article 
199(3) of the Constitution, as also held in 
the earlier judgment passed by this Court 
in W.P.No.324/2012. Mere fact that after 
withdrawal of appeal (ICA), Respondent 
No.2, 
again 
dismissed 
Petitioner’s 
representation 
vide 
order 
dated 
13.04.2017, will not confer jurisdiction on 
this Court, when it has already been held 
by this Court that in this case jurisdiction 

W.P.No.2901 of 2023  
 
 
 
 
 
 
4 
of this Court is barred under Article 
199(3) of the Constitution”.   
 
8. 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan in number of 
judgments including “Ex. Lt.-Col. Anwar Aziz (PA-7122) 
Vs. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of 
Defence, Rawalpindi and 2 others” (PLD 2001 SC 549), 
“MRS. SHAHIDA ZAHIR ABBASI and 4 others  
versus 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
PAKISTAN 
and 
others”  
(PLD 1996 SC 632) and “MUHAMMAD MUSHTAQ 
versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN etc” (1994 SCMR 
2286) has held that matters relating to the members of the 
armed forces is barred by Article 199(3) of the 
Constitution and also held that Article 8(3) of the 
“Constitution” shall not apply to any law relating to 
members of the armed forces. This view was later on 
followed by this Court in “ASIF MAHMOOD versus 
FEDERATION 
OF 
PAKISTAN 
and 
others”  
(PLD 2005 Lahore 721) wherein it has held as under: 
“10. … However, the provisions of the Act are 
protected 
under Article 
8(3)(a) 
of 
the 
Constitution from being challenged on the 
ground of inconsistency with the fundamental 
rights contained in Chapter I, Part II of the 
Constitution, therefore, non-compliance of the 
provisions of Article 10(2) of the Constitution 
could not invalidate the arrest and detention of 
accused officers under the Act. …  
11. It is admitted position that the detenu has 
been arrested under the Army Act and there is 
no reasons to disbelieve this statement as it is 
sufficient to infer that the detenu has not been 
arrested except in due C course of law and the 
matter relating to the members of the army 
force are immune from scrutiny of this Court 
in view of Sub-Article (3) of Article 199 of the. 
…  
12. Though the detenu in this case has not 
been an Army personnel but he has also been 
arrested under the Army Act, therefore, this 
case is also covered with the bar as contained 

W.P.No.2901 of 2023  
 
 
 
 
 
 
5 
under Article 199(3) of the Constitution of 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. …” 
 
9. 
Moreover, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
C.P.No.4794 of 2018 dated 06.04.2020 has observed as 
follows: 
“At the outset, we have noted that the very 
Writ Petition No.1494/2017 filled by 
Respondent No.1 (the respondent) before 
the High Court was barred under Clauses 
(3) and (5) of Article 199 of the 
Constitution for that the Respondent was a 
Colonel in the Pakistan Army and matters 
relating to Armed Forces of Pakistan are 
specifically excluded from being agitated 
before the High Court”. 
 
10. In view of the reply submitted on behalf of 
Respondents, the whereabouts of the Petitioner’s husband, 
authority having arrested him as well as place and reasons 
of his detention, are now known as he is under the custody 
of military and is being investigated under Section 2(1)(d) 
of the “Act” therefore, his production order cannot  
be made. Reliance is placed on “ALI RIZWAN RAJA 
versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN and others”  
(PLD 2019 Islamabad 273) wherein the Court in 
paragraph No.13 has held that  
“Since the whereabouts of Brigadier (retired) 
Raja Rizwan Ali Haider are known and he is 
under the custody of military under the 
Pakistan 
Army 
Act, 
1952, 
hence 
his 
production order cannot be made. The relief 
to the said extent cannot be granted, hence is 
disallowed. Moreovoer, in the light of report 
by 
respondents 
the 
detenue 
is 
under 
investigation for offences under Section 
2(1)(d) of Pakistan Army Act, 1952. The 
petition to the extent of second part of relief 
has borne fruit and is accordingly disposed 
off. Likewise in view of above discussion third 
part of relief prayed is disallowed. However, 
needless to observe that Brigadier (retired) 
Raja Rizwan Ali Haider may avail remedies 
available to him under the law.”

11. It is noted that the Respondents were quite correct 
whilst stating on last two dates of hearing that the husband 
of the Petitioner is in their lawful custody in a lawful 
manner under the “Act” and writ of habeas corpus is only 
maintainable if a person is detained without lawful 
authority in an unlawful manner. In the light of above 
referred judgments of Supreme Court of Pakistan, which 
are binding on this Court under Article 189 of the 
“Constitution”, this petition is not maintainable and is 
dismissed.
