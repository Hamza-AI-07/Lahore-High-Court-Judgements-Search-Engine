RESPONDENT BY  
Mr. Niaz Ahmed Khan, Advocate_____________________ 
 
  
RAHEEL KAMRAN, J. – In this reference application under Section 
133(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (‘Ordinance’), the following 
questions of law have been proposed for our opinion which are asserted to 
have arisen from the order dated 06.04.2022 passed by the Appellate 
Tribunal Inland Revenue, Multan Bench, Multan (‘Tribunal’) in ITA 
No.150/MB of 2022:- 
1. 
Whether the Appellate Tribunal has erred in law to 
cancel the orders of authorities below by holding 
that issuance of audit report and its confrontation to 
the appellant is mandatory without appreciating 
that audit proceedings in this case were initiated 
before substitution of sub section (6) and insertion 
of sub section (6A) in section 177 of the Income Tax 
Ordinance, 2001 through Finance Act.2019?" 
2. 
Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case 
the Appellate Tribunal was justified to ignore that 
for tax year 2017 the issuance of audit report was 
not required by law as the provisions of sub section 
(6) and sub section (6A), requiring the issuance of 
audit 
report, 
were 
substituted 
and 
inserted 
respectively in section 177 through Finance 
Act.2019?" 
3. 
Whether the provisions of sub section (6) and sub 
section (6A), requiring the issuance of audit report, 

Income Tax Reference No.36 of 2022 
2 
substituted and inserted respectively in section 177 
through Finance Act. 2019 are applicable for the 
audit proceedings initiated prior to the said 
amendments in section 177 of the Income Tax 
Ordinance, 2001?"  
2. 
Relevant facts of the case briefly are that the respondent-taxpayer, 
who is an individual deriving income from business and property, filed his 
return for the tax year 2017 declaring net income at Rs.18,00,000/-. 
Subsequently, he revised his return declaring the income from business at 
Rs.18,00,100/- and income from property amounting to Rs.4,32,000/-. Such 
return is deemed assessment order in terms of Section 120 of the 
Ordinance.  The case of the respondent was selected for audit under Section 
214C of the Ordinance and intimation of the said selection was sent to him 
on 09.05.2019. On 18.06.2019, representative of the respondent submitted 
power of attorney alongwith Bank statement, however, when despite 
various reminders the respondent failed to produce documents required 
from him, show cause notice dated 25.02.2021 was issued to the 
respondent and vide order dated 30.09.2021 passed under Section 122(4) of 
the Ordinance, the assessment order was amended whereby total income of 
the respondent was determined at Rs.229,747,705/- and an amount of 
Rs.79,395,075/- was determined to be payable as income tax. 
3. 
The respondent preferred an appeal against the aforementioned order 
before the Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals), Sahiwal (‘CIR 
(Appeals’), which was disposed of vide order dated 09.02.2022 resulting in 
remand of the case with the direction to provide proper opportunity of 
hearing as per FBR’s Circular Letter No.7(2) dated 01.02.1994 and 
examine the documents and explanation of the respondent with respect to 
the Bank credit entries. The respondent, still being aggrieved, preferred 
second appeal before the Tribunal against the aforementioned order passed 
by the CIR(Appeals) being ITA No.150/MB of 2022, which was allowed 
vide order dated 06.04.2022 in the terms as follows:   
“After considering the facts, perusing the available record 
and case law’s referred by the learned AR mentioned supra, 

Income Tax Reference No.36 of 2022 
3 
reported as 2018 PTD 1444(S.C Pak), ITA No.2522/LB/2020 
dated 
07.04.2021 
& 
ITA 
No.1597/LB/2011 
dated 
27.05.2021, we came to the conclusion that order passed 
under section 122(4) of Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 
without issuance of audit report under section 177(6) of 
Income Tax Ordinance 2001 is not maintainable in the eye 
of law therefore by following these judgments referred 
above, orders passed by the authorities below are hereby 
cancelled.”  
4. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
5. 
In the instant case, the respondent was selected for audit on 
09.05.2019 whereas show cause notice proposing to amend assessment 
under Section 122 of the Ordinance was issued to the respondent on 
25.02.2021. Perusal of the show cause notice clearly indicates that audit 
proceedings were still pending and no audit report was issued by the 
department till the amendments in question were made in Section 177 of 
the Ordinance through Finance Act, 2019. There is nothing available on 
record to show what substantive right, if any, had accrued in favour of the 
applicant on 01.07.2019 when the amendment made through Finance Act, 
2019 in Section 177 of the Ordinance in the form of substitution of sub-
section (6) and insertion of sub-section (6A) became effective which 
adversely affected the applicant.   
6. 
In order to determine applicability or otherwise of the substituted 
sub-section (6) and newly inserted sub-section (6A) of Section 177 of the 
Ordinance introduced through the Finance Act, 2019 (V of 2019) to the 
cases selected for audit prior to the said amendments where audit reports 
were still pending, it would be advantages to refer to the test of the 
aforementioned provisions which read as follows:  
(6) After completion of the audit, the Commissioner shall, 
after obtaining taxpayer’s explanation on all the issues 
raised in the audit, issue an audit report containing audit 
observations and findings. 
(6A) After issuing the audit report, the Commissioner may, 
if considered necessary, amend the assessment under sub-
section (1) or sub-subsection (4) of section 122, as the case 
may be , after providing an opportunity of being heard to 
the taxpayer under sub-section (9) of section 122.  
 

Income Tax Reference No.36 of 2022

7. 
There is no cavil that the aforementioned provisions became 
effective from 01.07.2019. Sub-section (6) ibid makes it mandatory for the 
Commissioner, upon completion of the audit, to obtain taxpayer’s 
explanation on all the issues raised in the audit and after that issue an audit 
report containing audit observations and findings. There is nothing in the 
language of the said provision which suggests retrospective application of 
the same. It means that cases where vested rights had accrued or transaction 
had been closed because of completion of audit prior to the aforementioned 
amendment, the requirements stipulated through substituted sub-section (6) 
cannot be pressed into service. There is, however, nothing in the language 
of sub-section (6) ibid which restricts application of the said provision to 
cases where audit was pending completion or still underway on 01.07.2019, 
which is the case here. Likewise, there is nothing in the text of the said 
provision that restricts its application to the cases selected for audit after 
any particular tax year. Indeed, the date of selection for audit hardly 
provides any basis for regulating applicability of the amended sub-section 
(6) of Section 177 of the Ordinance, which clearly would apply to all cases 
where audit was yet to be completed after the aforementioned enactment. 
This renders plea of the applicant qua retrospective application of sub-
section (6) ibid wholly misconceived thus untenable. 
 
Sub-section (6A) of Section 177 of the Ordinance empowers the 
Commissioner to amend the assessment under sub-section (1) or sub-
section (4) of Section 122 of the Ordinance, after issuing the audit report 
and  providing an opportunity of being heard to the taxpayer under sub-
section (9) of Section 122 ibid. Issuance of the audit report is a pre-
condition or sine qua non for the exercise of authority to amend the 
assessment under sub-section (6A) ibid and the requirement to grant 
opportunity of hearing is meant to ensure satisfaction of the due process 
requirement guaranteed under Article 10A of the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973. Again, there is nothing in the language of the 
said provision which suggests retrospective application of sub-section (6A) 
of Section 177 of the Ordinance. It means that cases where audit exercise 

Income Tax Reference No.36 of 2022 
5 
was already completed and proceedings to amend the assessment were 
completed or initiated with the issuance of show cause notice prior to the 
aforementioned legislative enactment, sub-section (6A) ibid cannot 
arguably be pressed into service. There is, however, nothing in the 
language of sub-section (6A) ibid which restricts application of the said 
provision to cases where audit was pending completion or still underway 
on 01.07.2019, which is the case here as manifest from the facts narrated 
herein above. Again, there is nothing in the text of the said provision that 
restricts its application to the cases selected for audit after any particular 
tax year. Indeed, the date of selection for audit hardly provides any basis 
for regulating applicability of the amended sub-section (6A) of Section 177 
of the Ordinance, which clearly would apply to all cases where audit was to 
be completed after the aforementioned enactment and proceedings for the 
amendment of assessment were yet to commence. This renders plea of the 
applicant qua retrospective application of sub-section (6A) ibid equally 
misconceived and untenable.         
8. 
The impugned order of the Tribunal is based on the determination 
that no audit report was issued in the instant case and that the amended 
assessment order passed under Section 122(4) of the Ordinance without 
issuance of audit report under Section 177(6) of the Ordinance was not 
sustainable in the eye of law, which finding is unexceptionable. Reliance is 
placed on the cases of Commissioner Inland Revenue, Lahore Vs. Asif 
Kamal (2022 PTD 965) and Commissioner Inland Revenue, Sialkot and 
others Vs. Messrs Allah Din Steel and Rolling Mills and others (2018 
SCMR 1328).  
9. 
It is trite law that in the absence of any stipulation to the contrary, 
any change in substantive law which adversely affects vested rights of the 
parties should always have prospective application. It is equally well settled 
that the Courts lean against giving retrospective operation where the same 
would prejudicially affect vested rights or past transactions. A prospective 
statue operates from date of its enactment conferring new rights whereas a 

Income Tax Reference No.36 of 2022 
6 
retrospective statute, on the other, operates backwards and takes away or 
impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws. Reliance in this regard 
is placed on the cases of Nagina Silk Mill, Lyallpur Vs. The Income Tax 
Officer, A-Ward Lyallpur and another (PLD 1963 SC 322), Adnan Afzan 
Vs. Capt. Sher Afzal (PLD 1969 SC 187), Nabi Ahmed and another Vs. 
Home Secretary. Government of West Pakistan, Lahore and 4 others (PLD 
1969 SC 599), Province of East Pakistan Vs. Sharafatullah and 87 others 
(PLD 1970 SC 514), Sona and another Vs. The State and others (PLD 
1970 SC 264), Hassan and others Vs. Fancy Foundation (PLD 1975 SC 
1), The Collector, Customs and Central Excise, Peshawar and others Vs. 
M/s. Rais Khan Limited through Muhammad Hashim (1996 SCMR 83), 
Malik Gul Hasan and Co. and 5 others Vs. Allied Bank of Pakistan (1996 
SCMR 237), Manzoor Ali and 39 others Vs. United Bank Limited through 
President (2005 SCMR 1785), Commissioner of Income Tax Vs. Messrs 
Eli Lilly Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd. (2009 PTD 1392), Muhammad Tariq Badr 
and another Vs. National Bank of Pakistan and others (2013 SCMR 314), 
Badshah Gul Wazir v. Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through Chief 
Secretary and others (2015 SCMR 43), Commissioner Inland Revenue, 
RTO, Rawalpindi Vs. Messrs Trillium Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd., Rawalpindi and 
others (2019 SCMR 1643) and The Commissioner Inland Revenue, Zone-
II, Regional Tax Office, Lahore Vs. Shazia Zafar (2022 PTD 1942). 
However, a statutory provision cannot be termed to have been given 
retrospective effect merely because a part of the requisites for its action is 
drawn from a time antecedent to its passing or operation thereof is based 
upon the status that arose earlier. Reliance in this regard is placed on the 
Halsbury’s Law of England (4th Edn., Vol.44 at Para 921), judgment of 
the supreme Court of India in the case of Vineeta Sharma Vs. Rakesh 
Sharma {(2020) 9 SCC 1} and Kashif Mahmood Vs. Additional District 
Judge and others (2022 MLD 1762). 
10. 
For the foregoing reasons, Question No.1 referred for our opinion is 
answered in negative whereas Questions No.2 and 3 referred above are 

Income Tax Reference No.36 of 2022

answered in affirmative i.e. against the applicant-Department and in favour 
of the respondent. This reference application is decided accordingly.             
11. 
Office shall send a copy of this order under seal of the Court to the 
Appellate Tribunal as per Section 133(5) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 
2001.
