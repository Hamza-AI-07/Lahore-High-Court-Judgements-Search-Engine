ABID HUSSAIN CHATTHA, J: This Civil Revision is directed against 
the impugned Judgments and Decrees dated 21.09.2011 and 29.03.2014 
passed by Civil Judge and Additional District Judge, Multan, respectively, 
whereby, suit for declaration of the Petitioners was concurrently dismissed.

Proforma Respondents No. 2 to 5 were served, who have not 
entered appearance till date and are proceeded ex-parte, accordingly. 
3. 
 
The brief facts of this case are that Mst. Shamim Akhtar and 
Ghulam Mustafa (the “Petitioners”) instituted a suit for declaration on 
18.12.2002 against Abdul Hameed / Respondent No. 1 (the “Respondent”) 
claiming therein that the Petitioners are owners of the suit property fully 
described in the headnote of the plaint on the basis of registered sale deeds 
which are still intact, however, possession of the same is with the 
Respondent in his capacity as tenant. By way of background, the Petitioners 

2 
 
 
 
 
 
C. R. No. 828-D / 2014 
 
 
disclosed that the suit property devolved from grandfather of the Petitioners 
to one of his legal heirs, namely, Sher Muhammad as per Court decision. 
Sher Muhammad died in the year 1978. The Petitioners are his legal heirs 
along with Muhammad Rafique, Nazir Ahmad, Perveen Akhtar and widow 
of Sher Muhammad. The other legal heirs sold the suit property to the 
Petitioners through registered sale deeds in 1983. Two days ago, the 
Respondent as tenant started to demolish the suit property in order to build a 
new house thereon and when he was stopped, he claimed that Sher 
Muhammad had executed a sale agreement dated 30.10.1977 (the 
“Agreement”) regarding the suit property, as such, he was owner in 
possession of the same. This assertion of the Respondent is not tenable since 
the suit property was disputed at the relevant time and even Sher 
Muhammad was not owner of the same at the time of execution of the 
Agreement. Subsequently, Sher Muhammad was declared owner of the suit 
property pursuant to an order of the Court, whereafter, the Petitioners 
became part owners of the suit property and the same got completely vested 
in them through registered sale deeds executed by other legal heirs in the 
year 1983. Moreover, the Respondent never contacted the Petitioners for 
execution of the sale deed based on the Agreement although he was in 
possession of the suit property and had good relationship with their 
predecessor-in-interest. In this context, it was stated that the Respondent is 
in unlawful possession of the suit property and the Agreement is result of 
fraud, thus ineffective qua rights of the Petitioners. The suit was valued at 
Rs. 400/- and as such, no Court Fee was paid. Accordingly, it was prayed 
that a decree of declaration in favour of the Petitioners and against the 
Respondent be passed by permanently restraining him from claiming 
ownership of the suit property, demolishing the house built thereon and 
transferring possession thereof to any other person. Importantly, the 
Petitioners did not specifically pray for a declaration of ownership on the 
basis of registered sale deeds or for cancellation of the Agreement of the 
Respondent. The Petitioners also did not claim specific relief of possession 
over the suit property.

C. R. No. 828-D / 2014 
 
 
4. 
 
The Respondent by filing contesting written statement, raised a 
number of preliminary objections, whereas, on merits asserted ownership 
and possession of the suit property based on the Agreement from the date of 
its execution claiming that the suit property was lawfully transferable on the 
basis of the Agreement by Sher Muhammad after receiving full sale 
consideration of Rs. 20,000. The Respondent further stated that at the time 
of taking possession in 1977, the suit property was in dilapidated condition 
and he spent more than Rs. 200,000/- at that time for its reconstruction. 
Hence, prayed for dismissal of the suit.

Relief. 
 
6. 
 
Pursuant to order dated 16.04.2005, the Petitioners were 
allowed by the Trial Court to insert relief of possession in the plaint. Vide 
order dated 26.01.2007, the Trial Court determined value of the suit property 
at about Rs. 31,000/- and directed the Petitioners to affix Court fee of Rs. 
2,325/- by the next date of hearing which was accordingly paid on 
26.02.2007. 
7. 
 
The Trial Court recorded respective evidence of the parties. 
Issues No. 1, 2 and 5 were answered in favor of the Petitioners and are not 

4 
 
 
 
 
 
C. R. No. 828-D / 2014 
 
 
pressed before this Court. Issues No. 3, 4, 7 and 8 were decided in favor of 
the Respondent by holding that the Respondent had spent Rs. 200,000 on 
reconstruction of the suit property; Court fee of Rs. 15,000 was payable by 
the Petitioners; the Respondent was not the tenant of Sher Muhammad or the 
Petitioners; and the Respondent has proved the Agreement, therefore, the 
Petitioners are not entitled to relief. Ironically, issue No. 6 was decided in 
favor of the Petitioners with the observation that suit property was 
transferred to the Petitioners through registered sale deeds.  However, no 
definite finding was rendered as to the status of the sale deeds existing in the 
names of the Petitioners vis-à-vis the Agreement in favor of the Respondent 
which is in apparent contradiction to the findings that the Respondent is 
owner in possession of the suit property and is not tenant of the Petitioners. 
The suit was dismissed and the appeal preferred by the Petitioners also met 
the same fate. Hence, this Civil Revision.  
8. 
 
It is pertinent to mention that during pendency of the suit for 
declaration of the Petitioners, the Respondent instituted a separate suit for 
specific performance of the Agreement on 07.11.2008 which was tried 
simultaneously by the Trial Court along with suit for declaration and 
decreed ex-parte on 21.09.2011. The Petitioners preferred two separate 
appeals which were dismissed on 29.03.2014 by the same Appellate Court. 
The Petitioners only filed the titled Civil Revision assailing the Judgments 
and Decrees passed in suit for declaration of the Petitioners and did not 
challenge the Judgments and Decrees passed in suit for specific performance 
of the Respondent which has attained finality. Nevertheless, record was 
requisitioned by this Court vide order dated 26.03.2024. 
9. 
 
Learned counsel for the Petitioners while interpreting the 
impugned Judgments submitted that Trial Court committed material 
irregularity by not fixing a timeframe for the Petitioners to pay Court fee. He 
further stated that Court fee amounting to Rs. 2,325/- had earlier been paid 
pursuant to order dated 26.01.2007 which was not taken into consideration. 
As such, suit of the Petitioners was dismissed for deficiency in payment of 

5 
 
 
 
 
 
C. R. No. 828-D / 2014 
 
 
Court fee, although the Courts below concurrently found that sale deeds qua 
the suit property in favor of the Petitioners are intact, therefore, the 
impugned Judgments are liable to be set aside. Moreover, the Respondent 
instituted a separate suit for specific performance based on the Agreement 
on 07.11.2008 which should have been consolidated with suit of the 
Petitioners but the needful was not done by the Trial Court resulting into 
passing of ex-parte decree against them on 21.09.2011 followed by 
dismissal of their appeal on 29.03.2014. However, notwithstanding the fact 
that the said Judgments and Decrees have attained finality, they are null and 
void qua rights of the Petitioners emanating from registered sale deeds 
which being registered documents take precedence over the decree of 
specific performance existing in favour of the Respondent in terms of 
Section 50 of the Registration Act, 1908, particularly, in view of the fact that 
decree for specific performance merely declares a right in favour of the 
Respondent which does not mature unless the same is implemented through 
sale deed. He relied upon case titled, “Muhammad Ishaq v. Muhammad 
Siddique” (PLD 1975 Lahore 909). Hence, the impugned Judgments are 
not sustainable.  
10. 
 
Learned counsel for the Respondent submitted that this Civil 
Revision is incompetent for the reasons that the Petitioners till date have not 
paid the deficient Court fee and the impugned decision of the Appellate 
Court dated 29.03.2014 appended with the instant Civil Revision is in fact 
the Judgment and Decree passed by the Appellate Court with reference to 
suit for specific performance of the Respondent. He explained that not only 
the Petitioners concealed the fact of filing Ejectment Petition against the 
Respondent which was dismissed throughout but also during pendency of 
the defective suit for declaration of the Petitioners, he instituted a separate 
suit for specific performance based on the Agreement. The Petitioners did 
not file reply to the application filed by the Respondent for consolidation of 
both suits, rather, deliberately disassociated themselves from the 
proceedings of suit for specific performance of the Respondent after their 
appearance therein and resultantly, the same was ex-parte decreed against 

6 
 
 
 
 
 
C. R. No. 828-D / 2014 
 
 
them on the same date and by the same Trial Court vide Judgment and 
Decree dated 21.09.2011 when their suit for declaration was dismissed. The 
Petitioners, however, preferred an appeal against the said ex-parte Judgment 
and Decree which was dismissed by the same Appellate Court on the same 
date when their appeal in suit for declaration was dismissed. The Petitioners, 
thereafter, did not further assail the said Judgment and Decree passed in the 
suit for specific performance which accordingly attained finality. Since the 
prior Agreement in favor of the Respondent has been proved, therefore, the 
Petitioners cannot claim title on the basis of subsequently registered sale 
deeds as the foundation of the same has collapsed. Hence, the subsequently 
registered sale deeds of the Petitioners have become null and void.  
11. 
 
Arguments heard and record perused. 
12. 
 
The first aspect of the case is as to whether suit of the 
Petitioners was dismissed for non-payment of Court fee and the titled Civil 
Revision is incompetent on this score. Initially, the suit was valued at Rs. 
400/- and no Court fee was paid. Later, pursuant to order dated 16.04.2005, 
the relief of possession was allowed to be inserted in the prayer clause, 
whereafter, an amended plaint was filed. The Trial Court vide order dated 
26.01.2007 determined tentative value of the suit property at about Rs. 
31,000/- and directed the Petitioners to affix Court fee of Rs. 2,325/- by the 
next date of hearing which was accordingly paid on 26.02.2007. However, 
while conclusively deciding the suit held under issue No. 4 that Court fee of 
Rs. 15,000/- was payable. Neither any timeframe was fixed for payment of 
deficient Court fee nor any adverse consequence was stated. Therefore, 
contention of learned counsel for the Petitioners that suit was dismissed on 
this score is completely misconceived. The Petitioners should have paid the 
deficient Court fee before availing the remedy of appeal. It may, however, 
be noted that the Petitioners despite candid finding of the Trial Court have 
not paid deficient Court fee till date, rather, they preferred appeal and this 
Civil Revision by affixing Court fee of Rs. 2,325/-, respectively. The 
deficiency in payment of Court fee apparently went unnoticed until the titled 

7 
 
 
 
 
 
C. R. No. 828-D / 2014 
 
 
Civil revision was finally argued. Ideally, the Appellate Court and this Court 
should have allowed time to the Petitioners to make good the deficient Court 
fee and proceed further, thereafter. However, as the case has been pending 
since 2014 and has been heard on merits today, this Court is not inclined to 
either postpone the hearing or pass any adverse order against the Petitioners 
on this count except directing them to pay deficient Court fee throughout the 
proceedings within one month from the date of this Judgment keeping in 
view the principles enunciated in cases titled, “Syed Zahid Hussain Shah v. 
Mumtaz Ali and others” (PLD 2023 Supreme Court 470); and “Kh. 
Muhammad Fazil v. Mumtaz Munnawar Khan Niazi (deceased) through 
L.Rs. and another” (2024 SCMR 1059). 
13. 
 
Another objection qua competency of this Civil Revision is that 
it has been instituted by appending certified copy of the Judgment and 
Decree passed by the Appellate Court in the suit for specific performance 
instituted by the Respondent instead of the Judgment and Decree passed by 
the Appellate Court in suit for declaration instituted by the Petitioners. The 
objection is tenable, however, since this Court has examined this Civil 
Revision on its merits and record had previously been requisitioned by this 
Court, therefore, considering the peculiar fact that the appeals with reference 
to the respective suits of the Petitioners and the Respondent were dismissed 
by the same Appellate Court on the same date, the act of appending wrong 
Judgment and Decree with the titled Petition may have been an inadvertent 
human error, the mistake is condoned in the interest of justice, particularly, 
as certified copy of the impugned Judgment and Decree of the Appellate 
Court has been provided at the time of arguments.   
14. 
 
On merits, essentially dispute between the parties is as to 
whether the Petitioners are owners of the suit property on the basis of 
subsequently registered sale deeds executed by other legal heirs of Sher 
Muhammad and as such, entitled to its possession or conversely, the 
Respondent is owner-in-possession of the suit property on the strength of 
prior unregistered Agreement executed by Sher Muhammad himself. The 

8 
 
 
 
 
 
C. R. No. 828-D / 2014 
 
 
possession of the Respondent since the date of the Agreement is admitted. 
The Petitioners conveniently concealed that initially, they filed an Ejectment 
Petition on 14.09.1991 against the Respondent which was dismissed vide 
order dated 26.05.1994 (Ex. D-3) against which they preferred an appeal 
which was also dismissed with costs on 06.07.1998 (Ex. D-5). It was 
conceded by learned counsel for the Petitioners that the said proceedings 
have attained finality. It is also established that the Respondent defended 
himself in the ejectment proceedings based on the Agreement and his 
possession over the suit property since the date of the Agreement. 
Notwithstanding the said fact, the Petitioners instituted suit for declaration 
claiming that the Respondent was their tenant over the suit property although 
the plea of tenancy had already been discarded in the previous round of 
litigation. The Respondent proved due execution of the Agreement against 
payment of entire sale consideration, more precisely in his suit for specific 
performance. Conversely, the Petitioners failed to prove that the Agreement 
in favour of the Respondent was forged or fraudulent and thus, ineffective 
qua their rights. 
15. 
 
During pendency of the suit for declaration, the Respondent 
instituted a separate suit for specific performance against the Petitioners 
based on the Agreement. The Petitioners alongwith other legal heirs of Sher 
Muhammad appeared in the said suit but later disassociated themselves from 
the proceedings which led to initiation of ex-parte proceedings against them 
and resultantly, ex-parte Judgment and Decree was passed against them. Suit 
for declaration of the Petitioners and suit for specific performance of the 
Respondent were tried separately but by the same Trial Court side by side 
and as such, suit for specific performance was fully in knowledge of the 
Petitioners who could have defended their claimed title based on registered 
sale deeds and could have established that the Agreement was fake and 
fabricated. However, for reasons best known to the Petitioners, they 
preferred not to contest suit of the Respondent and allowed the decree to be 
passed in his favour. The Petitioners then preferred an appeal which was also 
dismissed by the same Appellate Court and on the same date when their 

9 
 
 
 
 
 
C. R. No. 828-D / 2014 
 
 
appeal qua suit for declaration was dismissed. Admittedly, Judgment and 
Decree passed by the Appellate Court with reference to suit for specific 
performance of the Respondent was never further assailed by the Petitioners 
and as such, attained finality, the execution whereof is now pending with the 
Executing Court. 
16. 
 
The contention of learned counsel of the Petitioners that 
subsequent registered sale deeds in favor of the Petitioners shall prevail over 
prior unregistered Agreement in favor of the Respondent is not tenable for 
the reason that there is a valid and existing decree of specific performance 
passed by the Court regarding the suit property in favor of the Respondent 
which has attained finality. The Supreme Court of Pakistan in case titled 
“Muhammad Sadiq v. Muhammad Ramzan and 8 others” (2002 SCMR 
1821) held that the registered document will have precedence over the 
unregistered document, if it was executed earlier in time because title is 
determined from the date of execution and not from the date of registration 
of the document. In the said case, title based on unregistered prior sale deeds 
was recognized over subsequently registered sale deed.  
17. 
 
The last aspect of the case is as to what is the status of 
subsequently registered sale deeds in favor of the Petitioners? Once the 
Respondent proved his prior unregistered Agreement executed by Sher 
Muhammad in his lifetime against payment of the entire sale consideration, 
there was no question of devolving of the suit property to the legal heirs of 
Sher Muhammad. Since the suit property did not form part of the estate left 
behind by Sher Muhammad, there was no occasion for some of the legal 
heirs to get the sale deeds registered in favor of other legal heirs i.e. the 
Petitioners. Moreover, the decree of specific performance having attained 
finality, the execution whereof is admittedly pending, operates as res 
judicata to the claim of ownership of the Petitioners based on subsequent 
sale deeds. It is a well settled principle of law that if the foundation of any 
building collapses, the super structure built thereon would also fall to 
ground. As such, once the prior Agreement of the Respondent was validated, 

10 
 
 
 
 
 
C. R. No. 828-D / 2014 
 
 
the subsequent sale deeds became illegal and void, thus stood cancelled. The 
case law relied upon by learned counsel for the Petitioners is not attracted to 
the facts and circumstances of the present case as execution of the decree of 
specific performance is prerogative of the Executing Court, if required. 
Reliance is placed on case titled, “Muhammad Essa v. Government of Sindh 
through District Coordination Officer and 6 others” (2014 YLR 2452). For 
further reference, also see cases titled, “Maharaj Singh & others v. Karan 
Singh (dead) through LRs. & others” decided on 09.07.2024 (2024 INSC 
491)1; and “P. Ramasubbamma v. V. Vijayalakshmi & others” decided on 
11.04.2022 (2022 INSC 413)2. Hence, the concurrent finding of fact against 
issue No. 6 rendered by the Courts below stand modified, accordingly. 
18. 
 
 For the reasons recorded above, this Civil Revision is 
dismissed. No order as to costs.
