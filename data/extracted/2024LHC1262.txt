AHMAD NADEEM ARSHAD, J.  Through 
this 
Civil 
Revision filed u/s 115 of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, petitioners 
(Province of the Punjab, etc.) assailed the validity and legality of 
judgment & decree dated 18.04.2012 whereby the learned Appellate 
Court while accepting the appeal of the respondent set-aside the 
judgment & decree dated 15.07.2011 passed by the learned Trial 
Court and decreed his suit.  
2. 
Relevant facts forming the background of this petition are that 
respondent/plaintiff instituted a suit for declaration on 11.04.2003 
and sought declaration that he being lessee of state land from Rabi 
1970 to Kharif 1979 under ten years temporary cultivation scheme 
through order of Collector dated 18.11.1969 and on the basis of 
review order passed by Member, Board of Revenue dated 05.07.1995

is entitled to get the suit property measuring 48 Kanals, 15 Marlas on 
the market rate along with 10% surcharges in 10 equal installments 
and challenged the orders dated 24.12.2001 and 21.09.2002 passed 
by petitioner No.2 (defendant No.2 i.e. Member (Judicial) Board of 
Revenue, Punjab, Lahore) whereby he while using the power of 
second review set-aside the order of review of his predecessor dated 
05.07.1995. The respondent (plaintiff) namely Muhammad Yousaf in 
his plaint maintained that he was allotted land by the Collector vide 
order dated 18.11.1969 for 10 years temporary cultivation scheme 
from Rabi 1970 to Kharif 1979; that Senior Member (Colonies), 
Board of Revenue vide order dated 05.07.1995 while reviewing its 
earlier order dated 26.02.1980 declared that he is entitled to purchase 
land measuring 48 Kanals, 15 Marlas under his possession on 
payment of the market price plus 10% surcharge, payable in 10 equal 
half yearly installments; that petitioner No.2 reviewed said order 
through order dated 24.12.2001 and subsequently vide order dated 
21.09.2002 modified the order dated 24.12.2001; that suit property is 
under his possession since allotment and prayed that he be allowed to 
make payment of the suit property with 10% surcharge in 10 equal 
installments and proprietary rights be given to him.  
3. 
Petitioners (defendants) resisted the suit through filing 
contesting written statement whereby they raised certain preliminary 
objections that plaintiff’s suit is not maintainable in its present form; 
that under Section 36 of the Colonization of Government Lands Act, 
1912 the Civil Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the suit; that the 
plaintiff earlier instituted a suit with regard to the suit property and 

Civil Revision No. 414-D of 2012.

during the pendency of said suit, second suit is not proceedable; that 
the impugned orders were passed in accordance with law which have 
attained finality; that the suit property belongs to provincial 
government and situated within the prohibited zone which cannot be 
allotted; that the suit property was cancelled vide order dated 
17.01.1978 due to non-fulfillment of the conditions and appeal 
against it was dismissed on 02.07.1979 and revision against said 
orders also met the same fate vide order dated 26.02.1980, therefore, 
the review filed against said order after lapse of 15 years was not 
maintainable and the said order of review dated 05.07.1995 had 
rightly been reviewed vide order dated 24.10.2001. While replying 
on facts, they refuted all the averments made in the plaint and prayed 
for the dismissal of the suit. Learned Trial Court, keeping in view 
divergent pleadings of the parties, framed necessary issues and 
invited them to produce their respective evidence. After recording 
evidence of the parties pro & contra, oral as well as documentary, 
dismissed the suit vide judgment & decree dated 15.07.2011. Feeling 
aggrieved, the respondent preferred an appeal which was allowed 
vide judgment & decree dated 18.04.2012 and as a consequence 
thereof judgment & decree of the learned Trial Court was set-aside 
and the suit was decreed. Being dissatisfied, petitioners approached 
this Court through instant Civil Revision.  
4. 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and 
perused the record with their able assistance.  
5. 
It evinces from the record that the respondent Muhammad 
Yousaf appeared in the witness box as P.W.1 and produced Ghulam 

Civil Revision No. 414-D of 2012. 
4
Mujtaba and Khadim Hussain as P.W.2 and P.W.3. He produced 13 
documents as Exh.P.1 to Exh.P.13 and photocopies of four 
documents as Mark-A to Mark-D. In rebuttal, petitioners produced 
Fazal Mahmood concerned Patwari as D.W.1 but they did not 
produce any documentary evidence.  
6. 
The respondent produced allotment order dated 18.11.1969 as 
Exh.P.1. Perusal of said document, it appears that Lot No.35 
consisting of 23 Acres, 02 Kanals & 01 Marla was allotted to the 
respondent on lease under temporary cultivation scheme for a period 
of 10 years from Rabi 1970 to Kharif 1979. District Collector 
resumed the said Lot vide order dated 17.01.1978 merely on the 
ground that the respondent/allottee failed to pay the rent. The 
respondent assailed said order of resumption before the Additional 
Commissioner (Revenue), Bahawalpur, who dismissed his appeal on 
02.07.1979 by maintaining that the suit land was situated within the 
municipal limits of Municipal Committee, Hasilpur. The respondent 
challenged said orders through revision of revision (ROR 
No.2114/1978-79) before the Member (Colonies), Board of Revenue, 
Punjab, who dismissed his revision vide order dated 26.02.1980 on 
the ground that the whole land except Khasra No.328/6 stood 
transferred to the Municipal Committee and therefore Collector was 
not competent to grant its lease to the respondent. The orders dated 
17.01.1978, 02.07.1979 and 26.02.1980 were not brought on record. 
Being dissatisfied, the respondent filed a review petition (Review 
Petition No.216/1995). Said Review Petition was accepted by the 

Civil Revision No. 414-D of 2012. 
5
Member (Colonies), Board of Revenue, Punjab, vide order dated 
05.07.1995 (Exh.P.10) in the following terms:  
“In this case, the petitioner has requested that 48 Kanals, 15 
Marlas of rectangle No.328/6 which is still in his possession and 
is situated within prohibited zone, may be allowed to him at 
market price. As the petitioner has not so far been ousted from 
the land in dispute, I, therefore, keeping in view long affiliation 
of the petitioner with the said land which remained under his 
lease allow him to purchase the same land i.e. 48 Kanals, 15 
Marlas on payment of market price plus 10% surcharge, payable 
in 10 equal half yearly installments.”  
 
7. 
The respondent approached the District Collector for the 
implementation of said order. The Settlement Officer/District 
Collector Bahawalpur through letter No.HVC/60 dated 17.01.1996 
moved the review of the said order dated 05.07.1995 on the grounds 
that there is no policy with regard to the sale of the state land. 
Member (Judicial-IV), Board of Revenue, Punjab, Lahore (petitioner 
No.2) vide order dated 24.12.2001 (Exh.P.12) reviewed the order 
dated 05.07.1995 by declaring it unlawful and void. Subsequently, 
the District Officer (Revenue), Bahawalpur moved a letter dated 
17.06.2002 (Exh.P.11) and sought review of the order dated 
24.12.2001 with the contention that the review order dated 
24.12.2001 was passed in the review petition of the respondent 
instead of the review petition filed by the District Collector and 
prayed that title of the case may be read as “The State through 
Deputy Commissioner Bahawalpur (petitioner) Versus Muhammad 
Yousaf (respondent)”. Member (Judicial-IV) in the light of said letter 
amended the order dated 24.12.2001 vide order dated 21.09.2002 
(Exh.P.13) as under: 

Civil Revision No. 414-D of 2012. 
6
“State through the District Collector Bahawalpur 
(petitioner) versus Muhammad Yousaf s/o Abdul Razzaq 
(respondent).”  
8. 
Perusal of Mark-A “C. Form No.12” (Prescribed in Paragraph 
No.19) Ledger for Temporary Cultivation Scheme, the respondent 
deposited the rent till 15.10.1976 but failed to deposit the rent for the 
year 1977, therefore, his tenancy was resumed for non-deposit of 
rent of one year. Provision of Section 24 of the Colonization of 
Government Lands Act, 1912 provided that whenever a breach of 
condition of tenancy had been committed by the tenant, Collector 
could either impose a penalty or order resumption of tenancy, but 
where the breach was capable of rectification, neither of the two 
measures could be taken before calling upon tenants to rectify the 
said breach within a reasonable period. Failure to do so within said 
time, the Collector was required to independently apply his mind and 
decide to impose a penalty or order resumption of tenancy, but the 
Collector had failed to perform both statutory obligations and 
directly proceeded to resume the said lot. Therefore, the basic 
resumption order was not in accordance with the law.  
9. 
The respondent assailed the said order by preferring an appeal, 
the Additional Commissioner, while deciding the appeal should have 
seen the validity of said order under attack but he while dismissing 
the appeal upheld the resumption order on another ground that the 
suit land was situated within the municipal limits of Municipal 
Committee, Hasilpur. The Board of Revenue maintained the said 
order while dismissing the respondent’s revision petition.  

Civil Revision No. 414-D of 2012.

10. 
Now the question arises whether the Additional Commissioner 
and Member, Board of Revenue could resume the land on the ground 
that the suit land had come within the prohibited zone. There is 
nothing on the record to show that at the time of allotment in favour 
of the respondent, the suit property was falling within the prohibitory 
zone. The suit property was allotted by the Competent Authority 
after due verification of its status through revenue officials. There is 
no cavil with the proposition that land falling within the prohibited 
zone is immune from allotment under any scheme.  Said allotment 
could not be cancelled, because once the land was made available for 
allotment, it was transferred and settled on the respondent, it would 
supersede all the notifications imposing such prohibitions. Under the 
law, the presumption is that acts done by the statutory functionaries 
were done in good faith and in a lawful manner, according to law 
applicable at that time. Under the principle of locus potentiae, the 
petitioners were not justified to act in the complained manner to 
cancel the land of the respondent. The question as to whether a piece 
of land falls within a prohibited zone is to be determined from the 
date of allotment and not from the time of grant of proprietary rights. 
The petitioners failed to bring on record any evidence to establish 
that at the time of allotment or at the time of resumption the land was 
falling within a prohibited zone. The Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in a case titled “PROVINCE OF PUNJAB THROUGH 
DISTRICT COLLECTOR V. GHULAM MUHAMMAD” (1994 
SCMR 975) while dealing with a similar proposition observed as 
under: 

Civil Revision No. 414-D of 2012. 
8
“2. The respondent/tenant had been allotted land on temporary 
cultivation scheme which had to be resumed and thereafter he 
was settled on alternate land. When the question of conferment of 
proprietary rights to such tenant arose, the respondent was held 
not entitled to it on the ground that his allotted land fell within the 
prohibited zone and secondly it was excluded from allotment on 
the basis of being a part of ‘KHUSK BIAS’ river. On both these 
points the instructions of the Board of Revenue existed. As 
regards the prohibited zone, the instructions were that the 
distance should be measured as required when the allotment 
was made and not as when the proprietary rights were conferred. 
On this test, the allotment of the respondent was beyond three 
miles limits then applicable to him when he got the allotment but 
within five miles i.e., with the limits when he was to be given 
proprietary rights…..” (emphasis provided).  
 
 
In another case titled “PROVINCE OF PUNJAB THROUGH 
SECRETARY COLONIES, BOARD OF REVENUE AND OTHERS V. 
CH. ABDUL SATTAR.” (2012 SCMR 1007), august Supreme Court 
observed as under: 
“Having considered the submissions made and the law declared, 
we find that admittedly when the land was allotted to Abdul 
Rehman, the same did not fall within the prohibited zone and 
therefore would not be hit by a subsequent notification to which 
reference has been made above.” 
 
 
This Court also followed this dictum in the cases titled 
“MUHAMMAD AKHTAR V. SENIOR MEMBER, BOARD OF 
REVENUE, PUNJAB, LAHORE AND ANOTHER” (2008 CLC 825), 
“MUHAMMAD AKHTAR V. SENIOR MEMBER BOARD OF 
REVENUE AND ANOTHER” (2011 MLD 589), “PROVINCE OF 
PUNJAB THROUGH DISTRICT COLLECTOR, VEHARI V. NIAZ 
ALI AND 4 OTHERS” (2011 MLD 1149) AND MUHAMMAD 
FAROOQ AND OTHERS V. MEMBER (JUDICIAL-II) BOARD OF 
REVENUE, PUNJAB, LAHORE AND OTHERS” (2022 MLD 1129).  
11. 
The Member (Colonies), Board of Revenue, Punjab, keeping 
in view the facts & circumstances of the case reviewed his earlier 

Civil Revision No. 414-D of 2012. 
9
order dated 26.02.1980 vide order dated 05.07.1995 and allowed the 
respondent to purchase the land under his possession measuring 48 
Kanals, 15 Marlas out of total allotted land on payment of the market 
price plus 10% surcharge, payable in ten equal half yearly 
installments.  
12. 
Said order of review was subsequently further reviewed by the 
Member (Colonies) vide order dated 24.12.2001 and 21.09.2002. 
Now the question arises, whether a second review was permissible 
and whether the Member, Board of Revenue was empowered to 
review the order of his predecessor? Under Section 08 of the West 
Pakistan Board of Revenue Act (XI of 1957), the power of review 
was available which was exercised by Board of Revenue while 
passing the order in the first review. Further review of the order 
passed in review could not have been done by the Board of Revenue 
in the absence of any such power to vest in the Board by law. The 
Board of Revenue exceeded its jurisdiction by passing orders in 
question in an ostensible exercise of the power of review to vest in it. 
No power to review an order passed on a review petition by the 
Board of Revenue was available. As no power of second review was 
available under the law, the exercise of any such jurisdiction was 
without lawful authority and non-est. In this regard guidance is 
sought from the case titled “ALLAH WASAYA V. MEMBER 
(COLONIES), BOARD OF REVENUE, PUNJAB, LAHORE” (2006 
YLR 2084), wherein it was observed as under:  
“8. There is no provision in the West Pakistan Board of 
Revenue Act for filing a second review petition. This legal 
question of maintainability of second review petition by the 
Board of Revenue has already been dealt with by the 

Civil Revision No. 414-D of 2012. 
10
superior Courts. Careful analysis of the provisions of section 
8 (supra) leads to a conclusion that power of review can be 
exercised by the Board of Revenue, only upon an application 
filed by a person who considers himself aggrieved by a 
decree passed or order made by the Board and who, from the 
discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, 
after the exercise of due diligence was not within his 
knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when 
the decree was passed and the order was made. The Board 
has no power of suo motu review. In this context reliance can 
be placed to the case of Umar Din and others v. Member 
(Colonies), Board of Revenue and others (1984 CLC 17). 
 
10. The power of entertaining second review application is 
neither contained in the West Pakistan Board of Revenue Act 
nor in the Civil Procedure Code as contained in rule 9 of 
Order XLVII (supra). In case of Muhammad Shafi v. The 
Member (Colonies), Board of Revenue and 2 others (1995 
CLC 966), it has been observed that after dismissal of first 
review application, second review application on the same 
grounds and against the same order could neither be 
entertained nor adjudicated---Although there was no express 
prohibition for second review in West Pakistan Board of 
Revenue Act, 1957, yet the Act did not either expressly or 
impliedly exclude general principle of res judicata and rule 
of finality of judgment---Except for clerical or arithmetical 
mistakes or accidental slips or omissions in the decision 
which every Court, Tribunal or Authority has inherit powers 
to correct second application for review after the decision of 
first on its merits could not be competently instituted.” 
 
13. 
It is well-settled that the right of review is a substantive right 
and is always a creation of the relevant statute on the subject. The 
power of review being a statutory remedy cannot be assumed by an 
authority in the absence of a clear-cut provision in this regard. 
Similarly, a second review does not exist if not created or granted by 
a statute. After the final disposal of the first application for review, 
no subsequent review including the “curative review” shall lie. The 
august Supreme Court of Pakistan while dealing with the proposition 
of second review in a case titled “YAR MUHAMMAD AND 
OTHERS V. MST. SAMEENA TAYAB AND OTHERS” (2022 SCMR 
1592) observed as under: 
“The most important legal aspect of the case is that review 
petition of the petitioners before the Member (Judicial-II), 

Civil Revision No. 414-D of 2012. 
11
Board of Revenue, Punjab was allowed vide order dated 
14.07.1998 whereas transfer in the names of alleged Islamabad 
Oustees and the subsequent sale in the name of Respondent 
No.1 was made on 31.07.1998. Respondent No.1, after sale in 
her favour, challenged the order of review dated 14.07.1998 in 
favour of petitioners by way of yet another review petition 
whereas petitioners had filed an application under section 30 of 
the Colonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act, 1912 for 
cancellation of conveyance deed in favour of Respondents Nos.4 
to 7. Though the said review petition of Respondent No.1 was 
dismissed on merits on 29.09.1999 but the question would be 
that how a review petition was entertained and considered 
against an order of review. Legally 2nd review petition was not 
competent and was unlawfully and illegally entertained which 
under the law should have been dismissed on its very inception 
and there was no need to discuss the merits of the case once 
again.” 
14. 
The learned Appellate Court, keeping in view the facts & 
circumstances of the case as well as evidence available on the record, 
allowed the appeal of the respondent and decreed his suit. Learned 
Addl. Advocate General representing the petitioners remained unable 
to point out any illegality, irregularity or jurisdictional defect in the 
impugned judgment & decree of the Appellate Court.  
15. 
For the foregoing reasons, this petition is dismissed being 
devoid of force/substance.
