Ch. Tariq Javed, Advocate / Legal Advisor 
respondent (PWWF). 
Mr. Imran Khan, A-D/Legal (PWWF), Lahore.  
 
Departmental inquiry is pending against the 
petitioner under statutory regime provided under 
the provisions of Punjab Employees Efficiency, 
Discipline And Accountability Act 2006 - 
PEEDA Act.  
  
This petition is directed against order of 
02.09.2019, whereby order of de novo inquiry 
was repeated – earlier the order of de novo 
inquiry was passed on 29.10.2015, whereafter 
inquiry was conducted and inquiry report 
submitted on 17.05.2019. 
2. 
Legal question raised is whether order of de 
novo inquiry could be passed in wake of de novo 
inquiry previously ordered – allegations are 
same. [Whether powers under sub-section (6) of 

W.P. No. 65865/2019. 
 
-:2:- 
 
 
 
 
section 13 of PEEDA Act could be exercised 
twice.] 
3. 
Learned counsel submits that section 13(6) 
of PEEDA Act does not provide for passing of 
order of de novo repeatedly, and since law does 
not provide such option, therefore order dated 
23.09.2019 is illegal and void. Reference is made 
to following decisions in cases of “MUHAMMAD 
ATAULLAH. VS. ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN 
and 2 others.” (1999 SCMR 2321) and another 
unreported judgment of learned Peshawar High Court, 
Peshawar passed in W.P. No. 1376-P/2014 titled 
“HASANAAT GUL ETC.V S. CHIEF MINISTER KPK 
and others”.  
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel appearing for 
the respondents defended order of de novo 
inquiry. Adds that inquiry is currently pending, 
and no progress could be made in wake of 
restraining order by this court on 04.11.2019. 
5. 
Submissions heard. Record perused. 
6. 
Question raised calls for interpretation of 
scope and ambit of section 13(6) of PEEDA Act, 
which is reproduced hereunder, for reference, 
Section 13 Order to be passed by the competent 
authority on receipt of report from the inquiry 
Officer or inquiry committee (1) ………. 
Section 13 (2) …………. 

W.P. No. 65865/2019. 
 
-:3:- 
 
 
 
 
Section 13 (3) …………. 
Section 13 (4) …………. 
Section 13 (5) ………… 
13(6). Whether the competent authority is satisfied 
that the inquiry proceedings have not been 
conducted in accordance with the provisions of this 
Act or the facts and merits of the case have been 
ignored or there are other sufficient grounds, it 
may, after recording reasons in writing, either 
remand the inquiry to the inquiry officer or the 
inquiry committee, as the case may be, with such 
directions as the competent authority may like to 
give, or may order a de  novo inquiry.” 
7. 
Textual reading of referred provision of law 
places no such restriction on the competent 
authority regarding re-ordering of de novo 
inquiry, once de novo inquiry was ordered, 
previously. Interpretation proposed by counsel 
for 
the 
petitioner 
is 
fallacious. 
Such 
interpretation, if attributed to provision of law 
under reference, would in fact suggests curtailing 
/ limiting the authority / power of the competent 
authority to examine the inquiry report, presented 
in the wake of order of de novo inquiry, earlier 
made. Additionally, such interpretation, as 
proposed by the counsel, if accepted would 
implies that inquiry report, submitted post de 
novo inquiry order, would attain finality, ipso 
facto. Incidentally no final order was passed qua  
the innocence or guilt  of the petitioner in the 
context of relevant facts, nor any finality could 
be attributed to inquiry report, unless  any order 

W.P. No. 65865/2019. 
 
-:4:- 
 
 
 
 
is passed by competent authority. Since no order, 
in terms of sub-section (5) of section 13 of 
PEEDA Act, was passed, therefore option to 
invoke jurisdiction under sub-section (6) of 
section 13, ibid. was available and rightly 
invoked – in wake of reasoning extended. 
  
The only limitation sub-section (6) of 
section 13 of PEEDA Act provides is the 
condition of recording reasons and passing of 
such directions, as competent authority considers 
appropriate. Yes, competent authority cannot 
order de novo inquiry, once order in writing has 
been passed under sub-section (5) of section 13 
of PEEDA Act – in such situation it would 
become functus officio. The judgments referred 
are distinguishable on facts. I lay my hands on a 
decision 
of 
this 
court 
in 
the 
case 
of 
“MUHAMMAD TARIQ SAEED and 2 others. Vs. 
GOVERNMENT OF THE PUNJAB through Secretary 
Forest, Wildlife and Fisheries Department and 2 others.” 
(2011 PLC (C.S) 884), wherein, while exercising 
constitutional jurisdiction, order of de novo 
inquiry was declared of no legal effect, in the 
context of peculiar and distinguishing facts. 
Relevant portion of the decision is reproduced 
hereunder for ease of reference,  

W.P. No. 65865/2019. 
 
-:5:- 
 
 
 
 
“11. Neither of the two inquiries could prove the 
allegations of misconduct against the petitioners 
whereafter the competent authority exonerated them 
by means of its order dated 10-6-2010, which was 
passed under section 13(5) of the Punjab 
Employees 
Efficiency, 
Discipline 
and 
Accountability Act, 2006. A conjoint reading of 
sections 13(5) and 13(6) of the Punjab Employees 
Efficiency, Discipline and Accountability Act, 2006, 
shows that that upon receipt of the inquiry report, 
three options or courses are open to the competent 
authority. It can either exonerate the accused or 
punish them or order a de novo inquiry. If it is 
satisfied that the inquiry proceedings have not been 
conducted lawfully or on merits.  A competent 
authority cannot exercise more than one option and 
cannot order for de novo inquiry once it has 
exercised the option of exonerating the accused 
official. Since the petitioners were duly exonerated 
by the competent authority under section 13(5) of 
the Punjab Employees Efficiency, Discipline and 
Accountability Act, 2006, no fresh inquiry or de 
novo inquiry was called  for or could be  held under 
S.13(6) of the Punjab Employees Efficiency, 
Discipline and Accountability Act, 2006.” 
[Emphasis supplied.] 
8. 
No order of exoneration of petitioner was 
passed in terms of sub-section (5) of PEEDA 
Act, based on inquiry report, and instead 
competent 
authority, 
vide 
order 
dated 
02.09.2019,  opted to invoke jurisdiction under 
sub-section (6) of section 13 of PEEDA Act. In 
the case at hand, on both occasions the inquiry 
report was found deficient in material details – 
and while ordering de novo inquiry for second 
time competent authority observed that directions 
issued while passing order of de novo inquiry 
earlier were not followed. No element of mala 
fide is found, overtly or covertly. No interference 
warranted in absence of any illegality committed.  

W.P. No. 65865/2019. 
 
-:6:- 
 
 
 
 
9. 
Constitutional petition is devoid of merits 
and same is, therefore, dismissed. Observations 
hereinabove recorded are solely for the purposes 
of deciding the question of law raised, calling for 
interpretation of sub-section (6) of section 13 of 
PEEDA Act, 2006 in the context of order of de 
novo inquiry. No order as to costs.
