JUDGMENT 
Date of hearing 
17.12.2024 
Petitioner by 
Mr. Umer Hameed Khan, Advocate. 
Respondents by 
Barrister 
Zargham 
Lukhesar, 
Assistant Advocate General Punjab. 
 
 
ABID AZIZ SHEIKH, J. This constitutional petition is 
directed against the orders dated 19.09.2012 and 31.12.2012 
passed by respondents No.2 and 1 respectively. 
2. 
Relevant facts are that respondent No.2/DCO, Pakpattan 
Sharif advertised posts of educators in daily express on 
17.11.2011 under the Recruitment Policy dated 25.10.2011 
(Policy of 2011). The total numbers of post advertised for SSE 
(Engineer) were four. The petitioner applied for the post of SSE 
(Engineer), Tehsil Arifwala and as per merit list, he secured 
56.031 marks and was placed at serial No.5. All 04 successful 
candidates joined and the recruitment process was completed. 
However, subsequently services of one Usman Farid Chishti 
were 
terminated 
under 
Punjab 
Employees 
Efficiency, 
Discipline and Accountability Act, 2006 (PEEDA Act) on 
06.08.2012. The petitioner applied for his appointment being 

W.P. No.1982/2013 
-2- 
 
 
next on the merit list, however, the said request was declined 
through impugned orders, hence this constitutional petition. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the post 
became vacant due to termination of service of Usman Farid 
Chishti, hence, the petitioner was entitled to be appointed being 
next on the merit list. Submits that period of 190 days under 
Clause ix(d) of the Policy, 2011 will not come in the way of 
petitioner’s appointment. He placed reliance on “Government of 
the 
Punjab 
through 
Secretary 
Cooperative 
Societies 
Department Lahore and others Versus Asad Abbas” (2022 
SCMR 739), “Dr. Sumera Tabassum Versus F.P.S.C. and 
others” (2016 SCMR 196), “Province of Sindh and others 
Versus Ghulam Hassan Bughio” (2014 SCMR 643),  
“Government of N.W.F.P. through Secretary Education 
Department, Peshawar and others Versus Qasim Shah” (2009 
SCMR 382), “Rafaqat Ali Versus Executive District Officer 
(Health) and others” (2011 PLC (C.S.) 1615), judgment dated 
29.10.2014 in W.P. No.18648/2014 tiled “Hafiz Ali Ahmad 
Versus Secretary Education and two others” Judgment dated 
14.04.2022 in W.P. No.63174/2021 titled “Ehtisham Basharat 
Versus D.I.G. etc.” “Shahid Habib Versus Government of 
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through Secretary Elementary and 
Secondary Education Department Peshawar and 3 others” 
(2019 PLC (C.S.) 1426) and Judgment dated 26.09.2018 in 

W.P. No.1982/2013 
-3- 
 
 
W.P. No.817/2017 titled “Saiful Haq Versus Government of 
KPK and others”.       
4. 
     Learned Law Officer, on the other hand, submits that 
as Usman Farid Chishti was not only appointed but also joined 
the post and subsequently terminated under PEEDA Act, 
therefore, the post was no more vacant for appointment from 
waiting list. He submits that the case law referred above is 
distinguishable.  
5. 
   Arguments heard. Record perused. There is no dispute 
that the recruitment process for the posts of SSE (Engineer)   
was initiated under the Policy of 2011. Clause ix of the Policy 
relates to the letter of agreement, joining of service and offer to 
the next candidate on merit. For the convenience the aforesaid 
Clause is reproduced as under:- 
 
(ix) Letter of Agreement 
“(a)  The names of selectees will be declared 
provisionally by the Recruitment Committee and the 
selected candidates will get Pre-service Induction 
Training before joining the service. If a selectee does not 
join training, he/she will lose the right to join service and 
offer will be given to the next candidate on merit. 
 
(b) 
The selected candidates shall have to process 
computer tests and post training tests. After successful 
training, provisional Letter of Agreement shall be issued 
and signed between a selected candidate and Appointing 
Authority. 
 
(c) 
If a person fails to join the post within fifteen days 
or where a written refusal is received from a selectee, 
his/her selection shall stand cancelled and next person 

W.P. No.1982/2013 
-4- 
 
 
on the merit list  will be offered the Letter of Agreement 
(Annex-B) subject to provisions of para a and b/ante. 
 
(d) 
In case a person joins and leaves the same within a 
period of 190 days, then the Appointing Authority may 
offer the appointment to the next candidate on the merit 
list with the approval of Chairman District Recruitment 
Committee”. 
 
 
(Emphasis Supplied) 
 
From above Clause (ix) of the Policy of 2011, it is evident that 
under ix(a) the names of the selectees will be declared 
provisionally by the Recruitment Committee and the selected 
candidates will get Pre-Service Induction Training before 
joining the service. If the selectee does not join training, he/she 
will lose the right to join service and offer will be given to the 
next candidate. Similarly under ix(c) if a person fails to join the 
post within fifteen days or where a written refusal is received 
from the selectee, his/her selection shall stand cancelled and 
next person on the merit list will be offered the Letter of 
Agreement. Under Clause ix(d) in case a person joins and 
leaves the same within 190 days, the Appointing Authority may 
offer the appointment to the next candidate with the approval of 
Chairman District Recruitment Committee.  
6. 
The above Clause ix in policy of 2011 manifests that the 
next candidate on merit list shall only be given offer, if the 
selectee either does not join training or fails to join the post 
within fifteen days or where a written refusal is received from 
the selectee or in case a person joins and leaves the same within 
a period of 190 days. However, there is no provision that once a 

W.P. No.1982/2013 
-5- 
 
 
person is appointed and joined service but subsequently 
removed from service under PEEDA Act, the candidate next on 
the merit list shall be selected. This legal position was further 
elaborated by the Competent Authority in its approval letter 
dated 05.06.2012 (Approval Letter) whereby recruitment of 
educators against the left over posts which remained unfulfilled 
due to non-availability of candidates during the recruitment 
under Policy of 2011 was approved. In the said approval letter, 
it is specifically mentioned that where joining has not taken 
place or some candidates have left after joining, the candidate 
next on the merit list available will be issued Letter of 
Agreement. For ready reference relevant part of the approval 
letter is reproduced hereunder:- 
“The Competent Authority has approved the 
recruitment of Educators against all the left over 
posts which remained unfulfilled due to non-
availability of candidates during the recent 
recruitment under the Recruitment Policy-2011 
dated 25.10.2011. Presently, if any next in merit 
candidates be available against the seats where 
joining has not taken place or some candidates has 
left after joining, the EDO (Edu.) will issue Letter 
of Agreement immediately for such candidates. The 
joining of these candidates will be arranged on first 
working day after summer vacation”    
 
7. 
In the present case, against four posts of SSE (Engineer) 
the top four candidates including Usman Farid Chishti were 
appointed on 11.02.2012 and he joined the post on 02.04.2012, 
whereas the petitioner was at Sr. No.5 of the merit list. 
However, after joining and the completion of selection process, 

W.P. No.1982/2013 
-6- 
 
 
one of the candidates (Usman Farid Chishti) was removed from 
service on 06.08.2012 w.e.f. 02.04.2012 under Section 4 (b)(v) 
of the PEEDA Act. Under Clause ix ibid of the Policy of 2011, 
in case a person joins and leaves the same, only then a person 
next on the merit list can be selected whereas Usman Farid 
Chishti did not leave the post on his own rather he was removed 
from service under PEEDA Act, hence, the petitioner could not 
be appointed against the said post under the Policy of 2011 and 
approval letter. His removal from service under PEEDA Act 
will not render the seat vacant for selection of a next candidate 
from the waiting list, rather said seat can only be filled through 
fresh recruitment process.  
8. 
I have carefully gone through the case law relied upon by 
the learned counsel for the petitioner and found the same 
distinguishable. In the case of “Government of the Punjab 
through Secretary Cooperative Societies Department Lahore 
and others Versus Asad Abbas” supra, there were four seats of 
Sub Inspectors (BS-11) advertised and out of top four persons, 
the candidate at Serial No.1 was selected for the higher post of 
Inspector (BS-14), hence, did not join. The candidate at Serial 
No.2 refused to join duty and candidate at Serial No.3 
subsequently resigned and only one vacancy could be filled. It 
was in these circumstances that the candidate from waiting list 
was appointed and it was not the case where after joining, the 
candidate was dismissed from service under PEEDA Act like in 

W.P. No.1982/2013 
-7- 
 
 
this case.  Similarly, in the case of “Dr. Sumera Tabassum”  
supra, four posts of lecturer were advertised,  however, the 
candidate on top did not join and petitioner in said case was not 
allowed joining on the ground that stipulated period of six 
months was lapsed. However, the Hon’ble Supreme Court 
allowed petitioner to join on the ground that the time will not 
come in the way of candidate selected on merit to join. In the 
said case, also no seat became vacant due to dismissal of 
candidate after joining as in the present case.  In case of 
“Province of Sindh and others Versus Ghulam Hassan Bughio” 
supra, 43 posts of Deputy District Officers (DDO) were 
advertised and petitioner was at Serial No.44 of the merit list 
and subsequently candidate at Serial No.8 did not join the post 
of DDO, hence, the petitioner was appointed through 
intervention of the Court. This case is also distinguishable 
because here candidate was not dismissed after joining. In case 
of “Government of N.W.F.P. through Secretary Education 
Department, Peshawar and others Versus Qasim Shah” supra, 
some of the selected candidates did not join the service, such 
posts remain vacant, hence, appointment was made from 
waiting list. In said case, also there was no dismissal after 
joining. In all the aforesaid judgments of the Supreme Court, 
the candidates did not join or subsequently resigned, hence, the 
next candidate on the merit list was selected, however, in none 
of the above cases, the candidate after joining was dismissed 

W.P. No.1982/2013 
-8- 
 
 
from service and candidate next on the merit list was allowed to 
join. 
9. 
The case law of different High Courts referred above are 
also distinguishable. In the case of “Ehtisham Basharat” by this 
Court and “Saiful Haq” by Peshawar High Court, the 
candidates did not join whereas in the case of “Shahid Habib” 
supra by Peshawar High Court, the documents of the 
candidates were found fake before the process of training, 
hence his appointment was withdrawn. In none of these cases, 
candidate was dismissed from service as happened in the 
present case. No doubt in the cases of “Rafaqat Ali” and “Hafiz 
Ali Ahmad”, supra, the service of the candidate was terminated 
after joining, however, in the said cases only question discussed 
and decided regarding the validity period of 190 days for the 
waiting list, which was found to be unreasonable. It is neither 
discussed nor held in any of the above case law that once a 
candidate is appointed and joined the post but subsequently 
dismissed from service, the next candidate from merit list can 
be selected in the wake of Clause ix of the policy of 2011. 
Similarly in “Shabana Akhtar Versus District Coordination 
Officer, Bhakkar and 2 others” (2012 PLC (CS) 366), 
“Muhammad Saeed Zafar Versus District Co-ordination 
Officer, Mianwali and 2 others” (2017 PLC (CS) Note 5) and  
“Muhammad Aqib Irshad Versus Government of Khyber 
Pakhtunkhwa through Secretary Elementary and Secondary 

W.P. No.1982/2013 
-9- 
 
 
Education, Peshawar and 2 others” (2024 PLC (CS) 505), the 
candidates did not join the posts in question and next candidates 
were selected from waiting list notwithstanding expiry of 190 
days but none of the candidate was dismissed from service and 
next candidate was appointed from waiting list.  
10. 
The above interpretation of Clause ix of the Policy of 
2011 is not only explicit but also logical because when a person 
does not leave voluntarily after joining but is dismissed from 
service, there is stigma attached to the said dismissal. Such 
removal from service order is subject to challenge and the next 
candidate on merit list cannot be appointed unless and until the 
decision of dismissal attains finality from all relevant forums, 
however, the position is altogether different and next candidate 
can be appointed without objection from third party, in case the 
candidate does not join or leave voluntarily after joining.  
11. 
In view of the above discussion, this writ petition being 
meritless is hereby dismissed.
