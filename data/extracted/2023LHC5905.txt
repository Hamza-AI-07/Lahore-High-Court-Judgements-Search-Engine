Ex parte.  
 
Rasaal Hasan Syed, J. This appeal is directed against 
judgment and decree dated 03.12.2021 of the learned Civil 
Judge, Gujranwala whereby appellants’ suit for declaration, 
cancellation, 
possession 
and 
injunctive 
relief 
was 
dismissed.  
2.  
Facts giving rise to this appeal are that the 
appellants instituted a suit for declaration to challenge 
mutation No. 257 and subsequent mutation Nos. 693, 734, 
748, 1717, 5134, 5135, 6256 and 6258 as illegal and for 
incorporation of their names as owners of 06 kanals 15

marlas in khasra No. 581 in implementation of the exchange 
between the predecessors of appellants and the school and 
decree for possession in respect of khasra No. 581 measuring  
06 kanals 15 marlas. Claim set up in the plaint was that the 
predecessor of appellants/plaintiffs owned land measuring 30 
kanals, 01 marla in Mauza Ghari, Tehsil Nowshera Virkan, 
District Gujranwala which  during consolidation was left by 
them for public welfare; land measuring 12 kanals, 18 marlas 
in khasra No. 581 was  left for the Girls Primary School from 
the said land that got incorrectly reflected in the revenue 
record i.e. register haqdaran for the year 1962-63 and 1967-
68 as school ground. The Education Department instead of 
constructing a school in the land given for school, 
constructed school in the land  measuring 06 kanals, 15 
marlas in khasra No. 1167/654; and land measuring 06 
kanals, 15 marlas in khasra No. 581  i.e. land of the school 
was agreed to be given to the predecessor of the appellants in 
exchange of land measuring 06 kanals, 15 marlas from 
khasra No. 1167/654; further alleged that it was given to 
understand to the predecessors of appellants that the 
exchange was implemented in the revenue record but four 
months before the filing of suit,  it transpired on verification 
of revenue record that the Education Department had not 
implemented the exchange in the revenue record. Instead 
through mutation No.693 dated 02.9.1983 the land measuring 

  R.F.A. No.80638 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
 
-3- 
 
 
06 kanals, 15 marlas was transferred in the name of school 
but in exchange no land was given to the appellants’ 
predecessor and instead from khasra No.  1167/654 land 
measuring 01 kanal, 03 marlas  owned by the appellants was 
exchanged with land measuring 01 kanal, 03 marlas in khasra 
No. 1062/605 which was later transferred in the name of 
respondent No.10. It was asserted that  mutation No. 257 was 
sanctioned wherein land measuring 01 kanal, 3 marlas in 
khasra No. 1062/605 was exchanged with land measuring 02 
kanal, 18 marlas in khasra No. 581. It was added that in the 
year 1971 Hassan Muhammad, a temporary allottee, got 
executed mutation Nos. 254, 255, 256 and 257 on the basis 
of decision dated 26.4.1971 in connivance with respondent 
Nos. 1 to 3 and land of school in khasra No. 581 was further 
divided into two khasra numbers i.e. khasra No. 1056/581 
measuring 02 kanals, 18 marlas and khasra No. 1057/581  
measuring 10 kanals. It was asserted that on the basis of 
decision dated 26.4.1971 through mutation No.257 out of 
land measuring 12 kanals, 8 marlas of school land in khasra 
No. 581, land measuring  02 kanals, 18 marlas was 
exchanged with 01 kanal, 03 marlas. It was added that on the 
basis of mutation No. 257 further mutation Nos. 693, 734, 
748, 1717, 5134, 5135, 6256 and 6258 were also attested in 
the revenue record. The appellants/plaintiffs alleged that 
from time to time they requested the concerned authorities to 

  R.F.A. No.80638 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
 
-4- 
 
 
correct the record and cancel the illegal mutations but it was 
refused and, therefore, the suit was instituted for redressal of 
the grievance through decree of court.    
3.  
In response  to the suit, respondent Nos. 1 to 3, 5 to 
9, 11 and 12 submitted their separate written statements 
wherein they contested the matter on legal and factual 
grounds and maintained that the appellants had no cause of 
action, no locus standi to file the suit, the suit was not 
maintainable, and that the suit was barred by time  which was 
instituted to blackmail the defendants/respondents. It was 
explained that in the revenue record land measuring 12 
kanals, 18 marlas was shown as school ground and that 
mutation Nos. 254, 255, 256 and 257 were attested on the 
basis of decision of appeal No. 266 titled Hassan 
Muhammad, Temporary Allottee v. Moeen Ud Din, etc. 
dated 26.4.1971 and at the back of mutation No. 256, khasra 
No. 561 was divided into two khasra numbers i.e. khasra No. 
1056/581 measuring 02 kanals, 18 marlas and khasra 
No.1957/581 measuring 10 kanals; and mutation No. 257 
regarding khasra No. 1056/581 of land measuring 02 kanals, 
18 marlas was attested in favour of  Shawala Thakur and 
khasra No. 1062/605 measuring 01 kanal, 03 marlas was 
attested as school ground and that in khasra No. 1057/581 
land measuring 10 kanals was in the name of school ground 
and mutation No. 734 dated 20.9.1984 was attested by the 

  R.F.A. No.80638 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
 
-5- 
 
 
order of Assistant Administrator Trust Board vide order 
dated 02.5.1984 in favour of Kalay Khan son of Hassan 
Muhammad  in which khasra No. 1056/581 - land measuring 
02 kanals, 18 marlas - was also included. As regards khasra 
No. 1062/605, land measuring 01 kanal, 03 marlas, was 
exchanged with land measuring 01 kanal, 03 marlas through 
mutation No. 693 dated 02.8.1983; according to which 
khasra No. 162/605, land measuring 01 kanals, 03 marlas, 
was attested in favour of Muhammad Khan, etc. and from 
khasra No. 654/1 measuring 01 kanal, 03 marlas was attested 
in favour of Government Girls Primary School.  Khasra No. 
581 was divided into different khasra numbers by orders of 
AC(S) through ishtamal No. 266 dated 26.4.1971; details of 
which were mentioned on the back of pert sarkar of said 
khasra number. It was alleged that mutation Nos. 693, 734, 
748, 1717, 5134, 5135, 6256 and 6258 were attested on the 
basis of mutation No. 257 and the same were attested by the 
order of AC(S) dated 26.4.1971 in appeal No. 266. It was 
submitted that Rehmat Bibi made waqf qua land measuring 
12 kanals, 18 marlas in khasra No. 581 for the welfare of 
locality on the basis whereof school was constructed and that 
appellant had no concern whatsoever with the property of the 
school and that suit was mala fide. Respondent Nos. 5 to 9 
denied the claim of the plaintiffs/appellant and termed the 
same as barred by time, barred by section 91, C.P.C. and 

  R.F.A. No.80638 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
 
-6- 
 
 
Order I, Rule 8, C.P.C. Respondent/defendant Nos. 1 to 3, 5 
to 9, 11 and 12  accordingly sought dismissal of the suit. 
Respondent/defendant No.10 in the written statement not 
only controverted the plaint but also submitted that he had 
purchased land measuring 01 kanals, 03 marlas in khata No. 
409, khatauni No. 494, khasra No. 1062/605 vide register of 
rights for the year 1991-92 vide sale deed No. 219 and 
thereafter he built hospital on the suit property and is in 
possession thereof. 
4.  
Issues were framed from the divergent pleadings 
and evidence was recorded. Appellants/plaintiffs produced 
Gulzar Ahmad son of Hayat Muhammad (plaintiff No. 37) as 
P.W.1. Documentary evidence comprised Ex.P-1 to Ex.P-39 
which was tendered through the statement of their counsel. In 
defence Khurshid Ahmad, halqa patwari was produced as 
D.W.1, Akhtar Hussain Deputy DEO/Secondary Education 
Gujranwala as D.W.2, Abdul Sattar son of Muhammad Shafi 
as D.W.3, Mukhtar Ahmad son of Fateh Muhammad as 
D.W.4, Muhammad Aslam son of Ch. Ali Nawaz as D.W.5, 
Muhammad Rafique son of Ch. Khair Din as D.W.6, Kashif 
Aslam son of Muhammad Aslam as D.W.7, Muhammad 
Sarwar son of Qaim Din as D.W.8. Documentary evidence 
comprised of Ex.D-1 to Ex.D-91 was produced. After 
considering the evidence and points raised in arguments of 
both sides the learned Civil Judge, Gujranwala recorded 

  R.F.A. No.80638 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
 
-7- 
 
 
findings on main issues against the plaintiffs/appellants and 
dismissed the suit observing that plaintiffs/appellants had no 
locus standi  to bring the suit  nor had any cause of action 
accrued to them  and that  the suit was barred by time and 
that the plaintiffs were not entitled to any relief of 
declaration, cancellation and permanent injunction.  
5.  
Heard. 
6.  
Perusal of the plaint shows that the suit was 
instituted on 16.7.2020 to challenge the mutation entries in 
the revenue record including the sale transaction, etc. after 
more than 37 years and, in some instances, 40 years. 
Mutations, the cancellation whereof was solicited, bear Nos. 
257, 693, 734, 748, 1717, 5134, 5135, 6256 and 6258. Case 
of the appellants was that their predecessors owned land 
measuring 30 kanals, 01 marla in Mauza Garhi Tehsil 
Nowshera Virkan, District Gujranwala which was left by 
them for public welfare during the consolidation. Out of this 
land measuring 12 kanals, 18 marlas in khasra No. 581 was 
left for Girls Primary School which was wrongly reflected in 
the register haqdaran for the year 1962-63 and 1967-68 as 
school ground. It was also their grievance that instead of 
constructing the school in the land allocated for school i.e. 
land measuring 06 kanal, 15 marlas in khasra No. 581,  the 
Education 
Department 
constructed 
Government 
Girls 
Primary School in the land measuring 06 kanals, 15 marlas 

  R.F.A. No.80638 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
 
-8- 
 
 
bearing khasra No. 1167/654 owned by predecessor of 
resnopondents and allegedly agreed to give to the 
predecessor of appellants/plaintiffs land measuring 06 
kanals, 15 marlas from khasra No. 581 i.e. school land and 
were also given to understand that mutation of exchange had 
been entered and attested accordingly. They claimed 
knowledge of mutations under challenge four months before 
the filing of suit which as appears from the evidence could 
not be proved. Mutation No. 257 was attested on 10.9.1971  
whereby khasra No. 581 was divided into two parts vide 
tattima dated 10.9.1971 drawn on the back of the mutation. 
Mutation No. 693 was attested on 02.8.1983. In terms of this 
mutation land measuring 01 kanal, 03 marlas in khasra No. 
1062/605 was exchanged with land measuring 02 kanals 18 
marlas in khasra No. 581. Mutation No. 254, 255, 256 were 
also attested pursuant to the order dated 26.4.1971 of AC(S). 
The evidence shows that pursuant to letter dated 02.5.1984, 
mutation No. 734 was attested on 29.5.1984 in favour of 
respondent No. 16 who became owner  of portion of  land in 
khasra No. 581/1056 in Mauza Garhi, Tehsil Nowshera 
Virkan District Gujranwala vide register Haqdaran for the 
year 1979-80 and later respondent No. 16 sold his land vide 
registered sale deed No. 4415 dated 15.7.1984 in favour of 
Barkat Begum daughter of Noor Muhammad (mother of 
respondent Nos. 4 to 6) and Muhammad Aslam son of Ali 

  R.F.A. No.80638 of 2021

Nawaz (father of respondent Nos. 7 and 8). Later the 
purchaser sold land measuring 1 kanal to respondent No. 9 
vide sale deed No. 873 dated 26.12.1995. Strange enough all 
these transactions, though duly entered in the Revenue 
Record from 1971 till the filing of the suit, were not timely 
challenged. The predecessor of the plaintiffs had been alive 
for number of years but they did not challenge the 
transactions particularly mutation No. 257 and 693 in respect 
of which the suit was filed by the plaintiffs/appellants on 
16.7.2020. Under Article 120 of the Limitation Act a suit to 
challenge the mutation could be filed within six years from 
the date of attestation of mutation while the appellants filed 
the suit after more than 40 years from the date of mutation 
No. 257  i.e.  10.9.1971 and after more than 36 years from 
the date of mutation No. 693 dated 02.8.1983 which on the 
face of it was barred by time. Reference can be made to the 
case of Wahid bakhsh and another through legal heirs v. 
Ghulam Muhammad through Legal heirs (PLD 1990 Lah. 
193), Ashiq Muhammad and others v. Mst. Sugran (2023 
SCMR 1171) and Agha Syed Mushtaque Ali Shah v. Mst. 
Bibi Gul Jan and others (2016 SCMR 910) and Mst. Rabia 
Gul and others v. Muhammad Janan and others (2022 SCMR 
1009). 
7.  
As to the plea of the appellants that they allegedly 
acquired knowledge of the mutations under challenge four 

  R.F.A. No.80638 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
 
-10- 
 
 
months before the filing of the suit, the same is belied by the 
evidence on record. The documents viz. Ex P-18, Ex. D-2 
and Ex.D-62 reveal that the appellant No. 20 Muhammad 
Mansha son of Khan Muhammad signed mutation No. 693 
dated 
2.8.1983 
as 
“pattidar” 
while 
father 
of 
appellant/plaintiff No. 3 signed and thumb marked the 
mutation No. 693 as a witness being “councillor” of the 
village. Suit was filed by 64  plaintiffs but except 
appellant/plaintiff No. 37 (Gulzar Ahmad – P.W.1)  no one 
appeared in the witness-box, which raises serious adverse 
inference against the appellants. P.W.1, who had no power of 
attorney on behalf of the remaining plaintiffs/appellants only 
made hearsay statement, which was inadmissible. On being 
confronted with the documents which  were signed either as 
“pattidar”, “councillor” or as a “witness” to the transaction 
by the predecessor of appellants/plaintiffs, P.W.1 could not 
deny the fact that the mutation and transactions were based  
thereon;  yet they did not file suit in time. Record also 
reveals that mutation No. 257 Ex. D-1 was attested on 
10.9.1971 and on the basis thereof subsequent mutations 
were also attested. P.W.1 admitted in  in cross-examination 
the existence of construction at site in the form of banks, 
hospitals and houses which construction was never objected 
to at the relevant time. The facts on the record proved beyond 
doubt that appellants/plaintiffs and their predecessors had the 

  R.F.A. No.80638 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
 
-11- 
 
 
knowledge of transaction and mutations right from the 
beginning but filed the suit after 36 years. Having failed to 
file suit within six years in terms of Article 120 of the 
Limitation Act, 1908 the suit was hopelessly barred by time. 
The findings recorded by the learned Civil Judge in this 
regard, dismissing the suit as being barred by time are 
observed to be based on correct analysis of evidence and 
proper application law, and are affirmed. 
8.  
Another legal aspect of the matter is that the basic 
transaction and mutations which were being challenged in 
the suit pertain to the period when the predecessors of 
appellants/plaintiffs were alive. As per admissions in cross-
examination by P.W.1 his father died in 1993 yet he did not 
file the suit or agitate the matter during his lifetime. Same is 
the case with the other appellants/plaintiffs whose 
predecessors were alive for number of years but did not 
challenge the transactions during their lifetime. It has been  
consistently observed that where the real owner of the 
property who could have a cause of action to file the 
litigation or commence the proceedings or to challenge the 
act or document against his interest remain alive for number 
of years but despite having knowledge of the transactions 
never raised any claim qua the property or challenge the 
documents of sale in respect of property, or raised the 
objection which was being attempted to be raised by his 

  R.F.A. No.80638 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
 
-12- 
 
 
successors, this is not permissible as the successors will have 
no locus standi to question the validity of those transactions. 
Reference can be made to the rule in Mst. Faheeman Begum 
(deceased) through L.Rs. and others v. Islam-Ud-Din 
(deceased) through L.Rs. (2023 SCMR 1402)  and 
Muhammad Rustam and another v. Mst. Makhan Jan  and 
others (2013 SCMR 299). 
9.  
In view of the facts noted supra and the consistent 
legal position, this Court affirms the view taken by the trial 
court to the effect that the suit was barred by time, principle 
of  acquiescence, waiver and estoppel and that the appellants 
had no locus standi or cause of action to file the suit.  
10. 
For the reasons supra, this appeal is without any 
substance and is accordingly dismissed.
