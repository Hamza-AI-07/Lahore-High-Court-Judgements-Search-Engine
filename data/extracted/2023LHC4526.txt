Shehzad, petitioner seeks post arrest bail in case FIR 
No.686 dated 30.10.2022 registered for offence under 
Section 9(1)3C of the Control of Narcotic Substances 
Act, 1997 at Police Station Saddar District Sargodha.

Learned Prosecutor accepts the notice.

Heard. Perused. 
5. 
As per prosecution’s case, the petitioner when in 
possession of 1600 grams of ‘Charas’ was arrested on 
30.10.2022 
by 
police 
raiding party 
headed 
by 
Muhammad Aslam, SI. Challan as per police file was 
prepared on 05.11.2022 while report of the Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency was complete and signed on 
09.12.2022 but the record is silent about the reasons for 
delayed submission of challan on 10.05.2023. It is to be 
kept into consideration that this case came up for hearing 
for the first time on 24.05.2023 when the Investigation 
Officer was summoned to assist this Court regarding the 
argument furnished by learned counsel for the petitioner 
 
20.06.2023 
      & 
21.06.2023 
Mr. Sajjad Mahmood Bhatti, Advocate for the petitioner. 
Ms. Ummul Baneen, Deputy District Public Prosecutor 
along with Ch. Sultan, Addl. I. G. (Investigation), Punjab, 
Lahore, Farhan, SP (Investigation), Qadeer, DSP (Legal) 
and Ashraf, SI with record. 

- 2 - 
Crl. Misc. No.34710-B of 2023 
about non-submission of challan till then. Upon the 
information provided by Ashraf, SI, Investigation 
Officer, Incharge Investigation District Sargodha and the 
District Public Prosecutor were asked to join the 
proceedings along with detailed report explaining the 
reasons for that delay. According to the report submitted 
by the 
Superintendent of 
Police (Investigation), 
Sargodha road certificate No.1096/21 was chalked out in 
the name of Muhammad Aslam, SI/complainant of the 
case on 09.12.2022 for transmission of report under 
Section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 to 
the prosecution branch and thereafter, for its submission 
to the learned trial court. The report also says that not 
earlier to 18.04.2023, Muhammad Aslam, SI presented 
the challan to the prosecution branch but on the same day 
for rectification of defects, it was returned. Where after, 
he re-committed the report on 10.05.2023 i.e. after about 
six months and ten days of the registration of case and 
arrest of the petitioner.  
The available record does not carry any justifiable 
explanation regarding inordinately delayed submission 
of challan i.e. after about 190 days despite of the fact that 
Section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 
directs submission of challan within 14 days and in case 
of incomplete investigation, an interim report is to be 
submitted to the Court by the Station House Officer 
concerned within next three days and the Court is 
required to commence the trial on the basis of such 
interim report, unless, for reasons to be recorded, the 
Court decides that trial should not so commence. Though 
the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 does not 
provide specific duration for conclusion of trial yet 
Section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 
mandatorily requires submission of interim or complete 

- 3 - 
Crl. Misc. No.34710-B of 2023 
report within a given time in the form prescribed by the 
Provincial Government stating therein the result of 
investigation made until then. In the instant case, the 
accused/petitioner arrested on 30.10.2022 was sent to 
judicial custody upon the motion of the Investigation 
Officer himself on 31.10.2022. On 05.11.2022, having 
found the petitioner connected with the alleged offence, 
the Station House Officer prepared report under Section 
173 of the Code ibid. Meaning thereby, the investigation 
then was complete as the outcome of investigation was 
mentioned in the said report which for non-availability of 
forensic report till then at least required submission of 
interim challan to the learned Magistrate concerned 
immediately thereafter. This Court has observed that 
violation of provision of Section 173 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1898 has become normal practice of 
police especially in cases of narcotics which calls for a 
serious concerted concern and probe by the Inspector 
General of Police, Punjab and the Secretary, Prosecution, 
Government of Punjab. 
Another aspect observed is that SI Muhammad 
Aslam, complainant of the case, as per facts surfaced, 
clutched this case till the end as he is the person who 
purportedly captured the petitioner, he recovered the 
contraband, prepared the sealed parcel of the sample 
separated from the bulk, he transmitted the sample parcel 
to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency and even challan 
was entrusted to him for its transmission to the Court 
through the Prosecution branch. It is also to be noted that 
the case was investigated by Muhammad Ashraf, SI of 
the same police station and as per law the report under 
Section 173 of the Code ibid was prepared by the officer 
incharge of the police station. Hence, issuance of road 
certificate in the name of SI Muhammad Aslam, 

- 4 - 
Crl. Misc. No.34710-B of 2023 
complainant of the case instead of the Investigation 
Officer or any other official for transmission of challan 
to the prosecution branch and thereafter, to the learned 
court, in the peculiar circumstances of the matter in 
hand, is also a question that craves determination by the 
learned trial court. 
6. 
Today this Court has decided two other bail 
petitions bearing Crl. Misc. No.37217-B of 2023 and Crl. 
Misc. No.32111-B of 2023 having almost the similar 
facts. A common factor surfaced in these three cases is 
the previous criminal record of same nature of the 
accused/petitioners. It is unfortunately a growing 
phenomenon in our police culture that subordinate police 
officials book the persons having previous criminal 
record in narcotic cases by fabricating false evidence 
only to make the campaign or ‘crackdown’ ordered by 
the superior officers against the addicts or peddlers, 
successful that practice cannot at all be endorsed and 
encouraged. Order in the society is to be maintained and 
the crime is to be curbed by ensuring untainted justice 
for all. Viable expeditious proceedings in the case is also 
a requirement of fair trial. In this case, it prima facie, 
seems that right of fair trial guaranteed by the 
Constitution stands infringed because of apparently 
willful abstaining from submission of challan to the 
Court in time. It prima facie, stinks mala fide on the part 
of concerned officials which makes this case one of 
further inquiry into petitioner’s guilt. Finding the 
unjustifiably belated submission of challan, while 
granting post arrest bail to the accused, three members 
Bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, in the 
case of Adnan Prince v.  State through the P. G., Punjab 
and another (PLJ 2017 SC 298) has observed as under: - 

- 5 - 
Crl. Misc. No.34710-B of 2023 
“9. 
Of course, it is too late but we are constrained 
to give a wake-up call to the prosecution/State that 
in Criminal cases involving capital punishment, the 
Investigators and Prosecutors, consisting of large 
fleets who are being sustained and maintained at the 
cost of tax payers money of the poor people, shall 
diligently perform their statutory duties/obligations 
otherwise, they will be guilty of violating the 
mandatory statutory provisions of the Cr.P.C., the 
Constitution and Law relating to the prosecution 
branch. It is a universal principle of law that to have 
a speedy trial is the right of every accused person, 
therefore, un-necessary delay in trial of such cases 
would amount to denial of justice.  
Many years back, the State/Government with 
the object to put the criminal justice system into the 
correct channels, bifurcated the police force to 
preventive/detective, investigation and prosecution 
wings. The establishment of the same cost dearly 
the public exchequer because extraordinary budget 
was allocated for this purpose by all the 
Governments of the Provinces including Federal 
Government, however, such costly exercise could 
not improve the system because supervising officers 
of these three wings of the police are taking least 
interest to streamline the working of each wing, in 
an efficient and effective manner and to comply 
with the mandatory provisions of law. Thus even 
today charge sheets and submission of the challans 
before the competent Courts in criminal cases are 
delayed beyond the mandatory statutory period for 
no reason much less plausible. Even interim 
challans as required under the law are not 
submitted within the statutory period. This 
conduct and attitude as well as performance of 
investigating, prosecution and detective agencies 
are absolutely un-acceptable and un-condonable 
because on the one hand, the law is disregarded 
while on the other hand, with the passage of time 
and long delay in the submission of challans, trial 
in each case is delayed and some of the witnesses 
including star witness either vanish being killed 
by the opponents, meet natural death or abandon 
their permanent abode/place of official duties 
due to transfer to another place or district 
making it a cumbersome job for the trial Court 
to procure their attendance. This is one of the 
major contributory factor in the backlog 
crisis/pendency of criminal cases. Such type of 
un-condonable delay in many cases becomes a 
cause of frustration both for the accused, the 

- 6 - 
Crl. Misc. No.34710-B of 2023 
aggrieved complainant party and in some cases, 
the aggrieved party ordinarily takes the law into 
hands indulging in revengeful acts.  
10. 
This has certainly resulted in unrest and 
element of intolerance in the society which 
ultimately would have negative impacts on the 
performance of the government as a whole.  
11. 
 Accordingly, copy of this judgment be sent 
to the Attorney General of Pakistan, all the 
Prosecutor Generals of the Provinces and Islamabad 
Capital Territory-ICT, Advocate Generals of the 
four Provinces, DIGs/Addl. IGPs who are the 
Incharges of the Investigation Wings, Ministry of 
Interior, Govt. of Pakistan and all the Chief 
Secretaries of the four Provinces, all the Home 
Secretaries of the provinces, IGP-Islamabad, Chief 
Commissioner-ICT with the direction to hold 
deliberations and consultations and after giving 
deep thought to the subject matter, they should 
collectively and individually devise a proper 
strategy/policy to arrest this grave menace of delay 
and causes thereof and to immediately redress the 
same within the possible minimum time so that 
compliance is made with the mandatory provision of 
law and the relevant article of the Constitution in its 
true letter and spirit and to make accountable each 
and every officer who is found responsible for 
such delay and to show a visible and efficient 
performance in all three fields, failing which the 
public would be justified to protest that their money 
is going waste without any fruitful result even after 
introduction of the new system.” 
 
In another case titled Subhan Khan v. The State 
reported as (2002 SCMR 1797), the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan while granting bail in case of narcotics 
has also observed as under: - 
“ 
…It is mandatory for the police under 
section 173, Cr.P.C. to complete the investigation 
within a period of 14 days and submit the final 
report but if the investigation in a case cannot be 
completed within the aforesaid period, the officer 
incharge of the police station should submit an 
interim report to enable the Court to take 
essential steps for commencement of the trial. 
The non-observance of the above direction of law is 
one of the major reasons of worsening the law and 
order situation and delay in disposal of cases by the 

- 7 - 
Crl. Misc. No.34710-B of 2023 
Courts. It is general tendency that without proper 
check and restraint on the powers of the police 
official and locating the fault in the public 
functionaries the burden of negligence and 
inefficiency of police is put either on the shoulders 
of innocent people at the cost of public time and 
exchequer or it is shifted to the Court to be held to 
the Court to be held responsible for the delay in 
disposal of cases. The delay of more than one year 
in submission of challan in such petty cases being 
without any legal justification, would amount to 
delay the disposal of cases by the Courts and 
curtailment of liberty of the persons involved in 
such cases through abuse of the process of law. We 
having attended the matter, feel that the question of 
complicity of the petitioner, would definitely be a 
matter relating to the scrutiny to be made at the trial, 
therefore, we would not like to comment upon the 
innocence or guilt of the petitioner at this stage to 
cause prejudice to either party at the trial. We are of 
the considered view that the ground of inordinate 
delay in submission of challan by the police taken 
by the learned counsel for the petitioner in 
support of this petition being not ignorable 
would alone be sufficient for the grant of bail. 
The concerned quarter in the Ministry of Interior in 
the Federal Government and Home Departments in 
the Provincial Governments while taking notice of 
the situation should take essential steps to ensure 
that unnecessary delay in submission of final reports 
under section 173, Cr.P.C. in criminal cases is 
avoided and the Investigating Agencies should not 
be allowed to sit over the investigation beyond the 
normal period prescribed under the law without 
legal excuse. In case due to the negligence or 
inefficiency of an official, the delay is caused in 
completion of investigation and submission of 
challan, the Competent Authority should proceed 
against such official for, an appropriate action under 
the relevant Rules.” 
 
Similarly, in a recent case titled as Gul Rehman v. 
The State through AG, KP, Peshawar reported as (PLD 
2021 SC 795) in paragraph No.7 of the order while 
dealing with bail petition, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan has rendered observation that reads as under: - 
“7. 
Due to the neglect of the police-prosecution 
in not submitting investigation reports (challans) 
trials cannot commence; trials which would 

- 8 - 
Crl. Misc. No.34710-B of 2023 
probably conclude by the time the matter of bail 
comes before this Court. Therefore, either the 
accused is kept from being punished for the 
crime committed by him or he is unable to secure 
his freedom on being acquitted; in either 
eventuality a wrong signal is sent out, which is 
that either the judiciary is unnecessarily 
releasing the accused on bail or keeping innocent 
persons incarcerated for no good reason. 
Moreover, the focus shifts away from the early 
conclusion of trials to incidental matters, such as 
pursuing the remedy of bail by the accused and 
the resources of the State and in most cases also 
those of the complainant's, expended in opposing 
bail. Court time is also wasted in attending to 
bail matters which would have been better spent 
in attending to the trial and appeals.” 
Likewise, observation given by the same Bench of the 
August Court in case titled Amjad Khan v. The State 
through A.G. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and others reported 
as (2021 SCMR 1458) goes as under: - 
“7. 
…We are constrained to observe that this 
unjustifiable 
delay 
in 
the 
submission 
of 
investigation reports (challans) also vitiates the 
Fundamental Rights of 'fair trial and due 
process' which the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan guarantees in its Article 
10A. 
In this context, reference can also be made to the case of 
Ram Prakash Pandey v. State of U.P. and Amr. Reported 
as AIR 2001 SC 3592. 
7. 
Learned Prosecutor has argued with vehemence the 
previous criminal record and his alleged conviction in 
two of the criminal cases yet as the petitioner has 
reasonably made out his case one of further inquiry into 
his guilt, mere registration of criminal cases against the 
petitioner and even his conviction in two of the referred 
cases is not a fact sufficient to disentitle him to the grant 
of post arrest bail. Reliance in this regard is placed on the 
cases Muhammad Rafique v. The State (1997 SCMR 
412), Qurban Ali v. The State and others (2017 SCMR 

- 9 - 
Crl. Misc. No.34710-B of 2023 
279) and Nadeem Aslam v. The State and another (2019 
YLR 415 Lahore). In the circumstances, petitioner’s 
further incarceration till conclusion of trial not in sight, 
does not at all look justified hence, this petition is 
allowed and the petitioner is admitted to post arrest bail 
subject to his furnishing bail bonds in the sum of 
Rs.500,000/- with two sureties each in the like amount to 
the satisfaction of the learned trial court. 
 
Copy of this order be immediately sent to the Chief 
Secretary, Government of the Punjab and Inspector 
General of Police, Punjab for the needful to be done.
