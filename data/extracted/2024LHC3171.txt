ASIM HAFEEZ, J. 
This and connected Civil Revision No.38993/2023 are 
directed against consolidated judgment & decree dated 21.02.2023, whereby 
appellate court dismissed appeals preferred by the petitioner and respondent No.3, 
against judgment & decree dated 30.07.2022 of the court of first instance, which 
decreed petitioner’s suit for specific performance of agreement to sell of 
30.11.2020 [time for performance was extended twice with mutual concurrence], 
and directed petitioner to pay additional amount of Rs.6,769,350/-, over and 
above the consideration amount agreed under the agreement. Petitioner is 
aggrieved of the imposition of payment of additional amount. Respondent No.3 
objects to the decree of specific performance on the premise that agreement stood 
rescinded upon failure of the petitioner to arrange balance consideration of

Rs.24,500,000/- by the end of second extended period, which was 28.02.2021. 
For quick and complete understanding, operative part of the judgment of the trial 
court is reproduced hereunder, 
“This civil suit is hereby decreed subject to payment of 
Rs.67,69350/0 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
remaining 
consideration 
Rs.245,00,000/- by the plaintiff to the defendant No.1 within 30 days 
of this order. In case of this failure to pay the said amounts within 30 
days, suit of the plaintiff shall be deemed dismissed and in said case 
the defendant No.1 would be bound to return the earnest money 
Rs.65,00,000/- to the plaintiff within next days 30 days. There is no 
order as to cost.” 
 
2. 
Factual narration provided in the opening paragraphs of judgment of the 
appellate court is sufficient for understanding underlying facts, still some material 
facts, potentially touching the subject matter controversy, need amplification. 
Factum of Agreement to sell dated 30.11.2020, execution thereof and conditions 
embodied therein constitute admitted facts. First cut-off date was 02.01.2021, 
which was extended till 30.01.2021 and finally to 28.02.2021. There is no dispute 
that date for performance was extended due to injunctive order against property in 
question. Earnest money of Rs.6,500,000/- was paid and balance consideration 
payable was 24,500,000/-. Petitioner had arranged for pay-orders for balance 
consideration before 02.01.2021. Parties agree to disagree on two issues. 
Petitioner alleged that he was ready and willing to perform his obligations, but 
respondent No.3 was not in Pakistan till July 2021. Conversely, respondent No.3 
took stand that pay-orders arranged were cancelled before 28.02.2021 and 
petitioner had no funds to pay, which situation attracted default clause and 
agreement, wherein agreeably time was of the essence in terms of clause 3, stood 
cancelled and earnest money was liable to be forfeited. Suit was instituted on 
20.05.2021.

Arguments heard; record perused, and Court concluded as follows. 
4. 
Controversy touches down upon two questions. Whether imposition of 
compensation through additional payment is justified and secondly, whether 
agreement stood cancelled upon alleged default and was time essence of the 
contract – in the context of second issue the burden lies on the respondent No.3 to 
prove factum of default of the petitioner and establish that timely performance 
was central to the enforceability of the contract.  
5. 
First thing first. Whether imposition of compensatory amount – additional 
payment – was justified. Upon perusal of the judgments of the courts, which 
concurrently decided in favour of additional payment, it is found that findings 
with respect to additional payment were erroneous. Concept of compensating, in 
monetary terms, is essentially  a tool to recompense the party that suffered loss, 
injury or disadvantage. Loss caused; injury occasioned; disadvantage suffered, in 
contractual arrangements, would, correspondingly, be the cause and effect of 
default committed or failure attributable to one of the parties to the contract. 
Hence, before subjecting defaulting party to the obligation of compensating the 
non-defaulting party, it is imperative to substantiate ‘factum of default’. It is 
axiomatic that trial court reached conclusion that ‘Now the plaintiff and defendant 
No.1 are equally responsible for non-performance of the suit agreement to sell on 
28.02.2021’ [observed in paragraph 11 of its judgment]. If that was the position 
how could petitioner be penalized by subjecting it to payment of additional 
payment when failure was attributed to both the parties. Appellate court failed to 
identify and reject blatant discrepancy in the judgment, and instead endorsed the 
illegality. This peculiar mistake is fatal to the sustainability of the judgments. It 
appears that Courts misread the evidence and overlooked effect thereof. Evidently,

Rs.6,500,000/- was paid as earnest money. Pay-orders for balance consideration 
of Rs.24,500,000/- were arranged before the first performance date – [this fact 
was admitted by respondent No.3, who appeared as DW-1]. Time was mutually 
extended in wake of an injunctive order, which injunctive order remained intact 
till 09.02.2021. Final performance date was 28.02.2021. It is not disputed that 
pay-orders for Rs.5,400,000/- and Rs.800,000/- were cancelled before 28.02.2021 
and other two payment orders, for substantial amount, became ineffective after 
the filing of the suit on 20.05.2021. Notably, under the orders of the Court 
balance amount of Rs.24,500,000/- was deposited before 06.07.2021. In these 
circumstances, how lack of willingness could be attributed to the petitioner – no 
reasoning was found in the judgments. There is another aspect of the matter. 
Respondent No.3 appeared as DW-1, who admitted that he went to U.S in 
January 2021, after the agreement, and came back in the last week of July 2021. 
And who further admitted that he was not in Pakistan at the time of the extension 
of time-period for performance on 30.01.2021 and 28.02.2021. One of the 
conditions of the agreement was physical presence of the respondent No.3 before 
DHA, Lahore, at the time of transfer of the plot – [condition 4 of the agreement]. 
In these circumstances, whether finding of default on the part of petitioner is 
legally sustainable. I lay hands on decision in the case of “Muhammad Siddique v. 
Muhammad Akram” (2000 SCMR 533), where Hon’ble Supreme Court had 
awarded compensation, over and above the agreed consideration but in the 
context of different facts – wherein suit, though within limitation, was instituted 
after nine years of the agreement therein. In said circumstances, compensation 
was awarded.

6. 
In view of the aforesaid, I find the findings recorded and direction of 
payment of additional amount of Rs.6,769,350/- unjustified, unlawful and devoid 
of reasoning. 
7. 
Now I take up second issue, regarding significance of the performance 
within stipulated time. No doubt that timelines for performance were provided in 
the agreement and same were extended on two occasions. Without commenting 
on the circumstances leading to extension of time, the relevant question is 
whether petitioner had defaulted after 28.02.2021 and whether any intent of 
timely performance of agreement was demonstrated on the part of the respondent 
No.3. There is no hard and fast rule to determine whether time is the essence of 
the agreement, no doubt performance timelines in the agreement had significant 
bearing on the question of timely performance and effect of failure, but mere 
elapse of cut-off date, proprio vigore would not non-suit the buyer but such 
determination is dependent upon facts and circumstances encountered in each 
case. Respondent No.3 admitted absence from Pakistan during material times, 
who remained in U.S from January 2021 till last week of July 2021. Written 
statement is silent regarding issuing any notice of default on the part of the 
petitioner. No notice of cancellation was issued, let alone alleged. Respondent 
No.3 was the only witness appeared. No document was brought on record to show 
that any authority was extended to any person to undertake process of transfer of 
plot, in the absence of respondent No.3.   Learned counsel for respondent No.3 
cited following decisions to support argument of significance of time in the 
context of effect of non-performance, “MUHAMMAD ASLAM and others. Vs.  
MUHAMMAD ANWAR.” (2023 SCMR 1371), “ASIM JAMSHAID. VS. 
SHAHZAD IQBAL MALIK and others.” (2023 CLC 1100), “MST. SAMINA 

Civil Revision No. 23551/2023. 
Civil Revision No. 38993/20223.

RIFFAT and others. Vs. ROHAIL ASGHAR and others.”  (2021 SCMR 7), 
“MUHAMMAD JAMIL and others. Vs.  MUHAMMAD ARIF.”  (20021 SCMR 
1108), “MUHAMMAD YOUSAF. VS. ALLAH DITTA and others.” (2021 SCMR 
1241), “MUHAMMAD ABDUR REHMAN QURESHI. VS. SAGHEER AHMAD.” 
(2017 SCMR 1696), “HAMOOD MEHMOOD. VS.  MST. SHABANA ISHAQUE 
and others.”  (2017 SCMR 2022), “MUHAMMAD SAFDAR KHAN and another. 
Vs. MUHAMMAD NADEEM ABBASI and another.” (2021 MLD 617), “MIRZA 
SHAFAAT ALI BAIG. VS. Wg.Cdr. (Rtd.) KHURSHID ANWAR and another.” 
(2020 YLR 886) and “MUHAMMAD SIDDIQUE and 6 others. Vs. ABDUL AZIZ 
RATALVI and 7 others.” (2016 YLR 612). Decisions cited were rendered in 
wake of peculiar circumstances in each case, and no commonalty of facts and 
circumstances were found. In the instant case, both the courts dismissed the plea 
of cancellation of agreement, which findings show no error of law or irregularity 
in the exercise of jurisdiction. Respondent No.3 failed to prove factum of default 
on the part of the petitioner and also failed to make out a case for cancellation of 
the agreement in the context of condition 3 of the agreement. Respondent 3’s 
counsel emphasized on the decision rendered in the case of MUHAMMAD 
ASLAM and others. Vs.  MUHAMMAD ANWAR (supra) without appreciating the 
factum of admission of failure on the part of the buyer to arrange for remaining 
consideration on the date of performance. In the case at hand pay-orders of 
Rs.18,300,000/- were not cancelled at the time of final performance on 
28.02.2021 and on said date respondent No.3 was not available in Pakistan. 
Likewise, facts of cited case of “MST. SAMINA RIFFAT and others. Vs. ROHAIL 
ASGHAR and others. (supra) are distinguishable, wherein intention to purchase 
was conspicuously lacking, besides failure of the plaintiff to deposit the amount 

Civil Revision No. 23551/2023. 
Civil Revision No. 38993/20223. 
7
despite direction by the Court – in instant case balance amount was deposited 
under the directions of the Court.     
8. 
There is another flaw in the judgment of the trial court, and affirmed by the 
appellate court. Court observed that in case petitioner failed to pay balance 
consideration within 30 days, respondent No.3 would be bound to return earnest 
money. This is contrary to the terms of the agreement. Agreement provided that 
in case the buyer fails to pay the remaining amount – buyer is petitioner – earnest 
money shall be treated forfeited. Agreement says that in case the seller fails or 
refuses to arrange for the transfer, he shall be bound to return doubled amount of 
earnest money, this latter condition is not applicable since the buyer had opted for 
enforcement of the agreement by resorting to remedy for enforcement of 
agreement. Now what would happen if the petitioner failed to pay the balance 
consideration within 30 days, without further ado earnest money had to be 
forfeited.           
9. 
In view of the above, Civil Revision No.38993/2023 is dismissed. And 
Civil Revision No.23551/2023 is allowed and judgments and decrees of the trial 
court and the appellate court, to the extent of allowing / decreeing additional 
amount of Rs.6,769,350/- against the petitioner and direction to return  earnest 
money upon failure of the buyer to pay balance consideration are, hereby, set-
aside and declared of no legal effect. And suit of the petitioner is, hereby, decreed 
in following terms, 
“Petitioner’s suit is decreed subject to payment of remaining 
consideration Rs.24,500,000/- to respondent No.3 within 30 days of 
signing of this order. And in case of petitioner’s failure to do the 
needful, that is to pay the balance consideration within 30 days, 

Civil Revision No. 23551/2023.

petitioner’s suit shall stand dismissed and consequently the paid 
earnest money of Rs.6,500,000/- shall stand forfeited, and 
respondent No.3 shall be entitled to retain forfeited earnest money 
of Rs.6,500,000/- and thereupon petitioner shall have no claim 
against the property in question. No order as to the costs.”  
10. 
Office shall accordingly prepare the decree sheet.
