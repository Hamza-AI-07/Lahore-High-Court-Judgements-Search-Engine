ABID HUSSAIN CHATTHA, J: This constitutional Petition is directed 
against the impugned Order dated 01.12.2022 passed by Respondent No. 
1 / Secretary, Mines & Minerals, Government of Punjab, Lahore. 
2. 
 
Briefly, the Petitioner is a mining contractor who obtained 
lease for the extraction of sand stone through work Order dated 
21.12.2019 for a period of three years starting from 21.12.2019 to 
20.12.2022 in consideration of Rs. 70,270,000/- payable in six 
installments. The explosive license required to execute the contract was 
granted on 09.09.2020. It is the case of the Petitioner that due to non-
issuance of explosive license on time, some of the lease period was 
wasted in which the Petitioner could not obtain lawful benefits. 
Accordingly, the Petitioner was constrained to file an application on 
21.11.2022 under Rule 185-A(2) of the Punjab Mining Concession 
Rules, 2002 (the “Rules”) seeking extension in the lease period. The said 
application was entertained by Respondent No. 1 in terms of his 
revisional powers under the aforesaid Rule. The request of the Petitioner 
was conditionally allowed through the impugned Order, the operating 
part of which contained in paragraph Nos. 5 to 7 is reproduced as under:- 

2 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No. 81499 / 2022 
 
“5. I have heard the argument and perused the record. It 
is observed that a mining lease for Sandstone over an 
area of 226.03 acres near Chak No. 116 Janobi District 
Sargodha stands granted to the petitioner against a bid of 
Rs. 7,02,70,000/- for a period of three years w.e.f. 
21.12.2019 to 20.12.2022. The counsel for the petitioner 
has claimed that the petitioner was not able to get 
explosive license from the District Administration till 
09.09.2020, hence he was unable to work in the leased 
area for a period of nine months, resulting in irreparable 
financial loss to the petitioner. The counsel, therefore, 
has requested for extension in the lease period by 
revalidating the initial date of grant from 10.09.2020 to 
09.09.2023 i.e. date of issuance of explosive license. 
Whereas, on the other hand, the representative from 
DG(M&M) have strongly opposed the stance of the 
petitioner by stating that work of the lessee was never 
stopped in the leased area since date of initial grant. He 
also produced number of inspections, showing that the 
work of the petitioner was continuously in progress. 
However, in the presence of record produced by the 
Inspector of Mines Sargodha, there remains a question 
mark on the inspections produced by the representative of 
DG(M&M). 
6. On the other side, it is important to mention here that 
even if the petitioner was unable to work in the leased 
area owing to the reasons that he was not granted 
explosive license by the District Administration, it was 
the responsibility of the petitioner to obtain explosive 
license from the concerned quarter in a timely manner to 
operate the mining lease. This state of affairs shows that 
the petitioner was also not efficiently dealing with the 
matters of the mining lease and the public exchequer 
shall not suffer due to default & sluggishness on part of 
the petitioner. During the course of arguments, the 
departmental representative apprised the court, that the 
block under discussion is included in the current auction 
schedule. It has also came in the notice of this court that 
a status quo has been passed by the Hon'ble Lahore High 
Court Lahore against the auction of Sandstone blocks in 
District Sargodha owing to an exercise being carried out 
by the department regarding rationalization and resizing 
of sandstone block of District Sargodha to ensure safe 
and scientific mining. I am therefore of the considered 
opinion that instead of revalidation, extension in the lease 
period at the rate of newly fixed reserve price can be 
granted to the petitioner under rule 228 of ibid rules and 
on administrative grounds to safeguard the public 
exchequer. 
7. In view of what has been discussed above, I am 
therefore inclined to extend the lease period of mining 
lease held by the petitioner till 09.09.2023, subject to 
payment of advance proportionate bid money on monthly 

3 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No. 81499 / 2022 
 
basis at the rate of newly fixed reserve price of the block 
in the public interest. The Director Licensing Minor 
Minerals Punjab is advised to proceed in light of above 
directions. Disposed of accordingly.” 
 
3. 
 
Learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the 
Petitioner is aggrieved to the extent of payment of advance proportionate 
bid money on monthly basis at the rate of newly fixed reserve price of 
the block which is patently unlawful. The Petitioner was only liable to 
pay advance proportionate lease money at the rate at which the Petitioner 
had obtained the lease. In this context, it is argued that the impugned 
Order is against Rule 228 of the Rules. Further, in another identical case, 
Respondent No. 1 allowed extension of lease against proportionate lease 
amount vide Order dated 13.11.2019. Finally, it was stated that the 
impugned Order is against the Orders dated 12.03.2019 and 02.04.2019 
passed by this Court in W. P. No. 9428 / 2019.  
4. 
 
Learned Law Officer, while relying upon the report and 
parawise comments filed on behalf of the Respondents, stated that as per 
Rule 228 of the Rules, a leased area is required to be auctioned within 
three months before its expiry but prior to auction, a Special Experts 
Committee notified by the Government vide notification dated 
27.01.2016 is required to determine the reserve price of mining leases of 
minor minerals under Rule 197-A of the Rules based on different 
technical parameters. The said Committee has lately determined the 
reserve price as Rs. 400,000,000/-, whereafter, leases of minor minerals 
were advertised for open auction against the reserve price determined by 
the Special Experts Committee on 15.11.2022 under Rule 198 of the 
Rules. As per the said proclamation, leases of minor minerals including 
the sandstone block under discussion in District, Sargodha were 
scheduled to be auctioned on 30.11.2022, 26.12.2022 and 23.01.2023. In 
this context, Respondent No. 1 had lawfully passed the impugned Order 
in line with the law laid down by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in C. P. 
No. 590 of 2014 decided on 29.05.2014. The Petitioner after having 
availed the relief provided by Respondent No. 1 in the form of nine 
months extended lease period, now wants to avail further relief from this 

4 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No. 81499 / 2022 
 
Court which if granted would cause irreparable loss of Rs. 82,432,503/- 
to the public exchequer. Therefore, this Petition is liable to be dismissed. 
5. 
 
The only point of determination before this Court is as to 
whether the Petitioner was entitled for extension in the lease period 
subject to payment of advance proportionate bid money at the time of 
grant of lease or at the rate of newly fixed reserve price in the light of the 
precise contention of the Petitioner that he could not enjoy the full lease 
period of three years due to non-issuance of explosive license on time. In 
this respect, Rule 222 of the Rules was fully attracted which is 
reproduced as under:- 
“222. Refund of proportionate bid money.- In case a 
lessee fails to assume possession of the area or work 
therein due to circumstances beyond his control and 
informs within a period of fifteen days from the date he 
first faced the hindrance in this respect and proves it to 
the satisfaction of the Licensing Authority, it may refund 
the proportionate bid money to that extent:  
Provided that no relief under this rule shall be admissible 
due to rains or floods in the rivers, streams or of 
dangerous quarry operations.” 
 
However, admittedly, the Petitioner did not invoke the said Rule and did 
not raise any concern with respect to loss of lease period until he filed 
the application for extension in lease period under Rule 228 of the Rules 
before Respondent No. 1 immediately before the expiry of lease period 
which was conditionally allowed subject to payment of advance 
proportionate bid money on monthly basis at the rate of newly fixed 
reserve price of the block.  
6. 
 
Rule 228 of the Rules being relevant is also reproduced as 
under:- 
“228. Re-auction of leased area.- A leased area may be 
re-auctioned within three months before its expiry but if 
the auction or the grant of lease is delayed due to certain 
reasons, the Licensing Authority may extend the period of 
previous lease upto the date of next grant on payment of 
proportionate bid money in advance for the extended 
period:  
Provided that any extension beyond a period of six 
months on this account shall be subject to the approval of 
Director General, Mines and Minerals, Punjab. 

5 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No. 81499 / 2022 
 
Provided further that extension beyond a total period of 
one year shall be subject to the approval of the 
Secretary.” 
7. 
 
Rule 228 of the Rules was interpreted by the Supreme Court 
of Pakistan in C. P. No. 590 of 2014 decided on 29.04.2014 in the 
following terms:- 
“We have gone through the letter dated 11.06.2011 
issued by the Assistant Director Mines & Minerals, 
Attock, addressed to the respondent advising him to 
deposit Rs.570,834/- along with 05% income tax, the 
balance of Rs. 783,334/-, for the one month period from 
03.06.2011 to 02.07.2011. It was clarified that the 
respondent could continue with the excavation work only 
if the above terms were accepted. The respondent duly 
accepted the terms of the offer as he continued with the 
excavation. As regards interpretation of Rule 228 of the 
Rules we agree with the learned Law Officer that the bid 
money mentioned in the said rule relates to the new bid 
for which the mine was being leased out to the highest 
bidder. Had the intention been to allow extension of lease 
to the old lessee on the basis of the rate on which he was 
already making payments Rule 228 would have referred 
to the lease amount and not the bid money. The High 
Court, with respect, had misinterpreted the rule and 
focused on the logic behind the Rule rather the wordings 
of the Rule Itself. Even otherwise the old lessee should 
make payment according to the new market rate for the 
extended period.” 
 
8. 
 
It becomes evident from the above that the Petitioner in 
terms of his grievance for the lost period of lease did not seek refund of 
proportionate bid money in terms of Rule 222 of the Rules but requested 
the department for extension in the lease period under Rule 228 of the 
Rules just before expiry of the original lease period when the leasing 
area had been included in the schedule of auction and the fresh reserve 
price had been duly determined by the Special Experts Committee under 
Rule 197-A of the Rules. After obtaining relief from Respondent No. 1, 
the Petitioner had already consumed the extended lease period which 
demonstrates that in essence, he had accepted the terms of extension in 
the lease period.  
9. 
 
When a contractor bids for a mining contract, he caters for 
all potential impediments in the execution of the contract if declared 
successful and submits his bid, accordingly. Notwithstanding the same, 

6 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No. 81499 / 2022 
 
Rule 222 of the Rules is available for certain unforeseen or extraordinary 
circumstances to cater for lost period of lease. The term „proportionate 
bid money‟ employed in Rule 222 of the Rules relates to bid money at 
which the bidder was granted the mining lease. However, the term 
„proportionate bid money‟ employed in Rule 228 of the Rules relates to 
prevalent reserve price of new bid for the reason that due to afflux of 
time, the prices have increased and cannot be deemed to remain static. 
Even otherwise, it is now well entrenched in our jurisprudence that 
public properties are required to be auctioned at the best possible price to 
avoid any financial loss to the exchequer. The finding of Respondent No. 
1 was squarely in line with the reasoning of the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan and in accordance with the mandate of Rule 228 of the Rules. 
As such, the lease period was rightly extended subject to payment of 
advance proportionate bid money at the rate of newly fixed reserve price 
of the block.  
10. 
 
It may also be noted that the Order dated 13.11.2019 passed 
by Respondent No. 1 is not identical to the case of the Petitioner as the 
Petitioner therein had remained in possession for 93 days beyond the 
valid lease period but the possession of the area was taken over before 
the date of new auction. Moreover, the Orders dated 12.03.2019 and 
02.04.2019 passed in W. P. No. 9428 / 2019 do not relate to the facts and 
circumstances of the instant case. Even otherwise a wrong past practice, 
if any, is no ground for repeating the wrong and cannot be pressed for 
relief. 
11. 
 
In view of the above, this constitutional Petition, being 
devoid of any merit, is dismissed, accordingly.
