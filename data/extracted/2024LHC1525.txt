JUDGMENT 
 
 
Date of hearing 
 
20.02.2024 
Appellant by 
 
Mr. Shehzada Muhammad Zeeshan 
Mirza, Mr. Inam Ul Haq Buttar and 
Ms. Yamna Baig, learned Advocates. 
Respondent by 
Mr. 
Muhammad 
Shakeel 
Abid, 
learned Advocate. 
 
 
 
SULTAN TANVIR AHMAD, J:– Through this 
appeal, filed under section 19 of Intellectual Property 
Organization of Pakistan Act, 2012, the appellant has raised 
challenge against order dated 12.10.2023 passed by learned 
Intellectual Property Tribunal, Lahore (the „Tribunal’). 
2.  
The respondent filed a suit for permanent and 
mandatory injunction against the appellant at Islamabad, which 
was returned vide order dated 22.06.2021 and it was presented 
before the learned Tribunal on 14.07.2021 (hereinafter called 
as the „first suit’). The suit was being contested by the 
appellant, however, as a consequence of application for early 
hearing the same was fixed and then allowed to be withdrawn 
with permission to file fresh after removing some formal 
defect on 21.05.2022. After obtaining this permission, on the 
same day, another suit No. 259/IPT/2023 titled “Rashid 
Mahmood Sidhu vs. M. Zulfiqar Ali” seeking permanent 

 
FAO No. 72708 of 2023 
 
 
2 
injunction, damages etc. (hereinafter called as the „second 
suit‟) was filed. The order dated 21.05.2022 of the learned 
Tribunal, allowing to withdraw the first suit with the 
permission to institute a fresh, was assailed in F.A.O. No. 
46771 of 2022 and this Court vide order dated 08.03.2023 
directed the learned Tribunal to consider the matter afresh. 
Resultantly, the first suit was fixed for rehearing and on 
12.07.2023 the learned Tribunal refused the application filed 
under Order XXIII Rule 1(2)(a) and (b) of Civil Procedure 
Code, 1908 („CPC‟).  
3. 
The second suit, which was filed as a result of 
order dated 21.05.2022, remained pending in this duration 
having adjourned sine die vide order dated 03.05.2023. The 
learned Tribunal on 03.08.2023 permitted to revive the second 
suit. This order was challenged in F.A.O. No. 54707/2023 and 
this Court vide order dated 05.09.2023 disposed of the appeal 
in the following manner: - 
          “…Learned counsel confronted that 
even if this legal position is accepted, how 
the Tribunal will decide the question of 
maintainability of second suit, unless the 
same is restored and parties are heard on 
this legal question before passing a 
reasoned 
order. 
Learned 
counsel 
in 
response candidly submits that he will not 
press this appeal in order to file 
appropriate application with the learned 
Tribunal regarding maintainability of first 
suit, however, requests that direction may 
be issued for early decision of said 
application if filed. Order accordingly. 
Appeal is disposed of…” 
 
  
As a consequence of above order the case was 
heard by the learned Tribunal on 12.10.2023 when it was 
concluded that filing of the second suit is not hit by the bar 
contained in Order XXIII Rule 1(3) of CPC and permitted the 
respondent to maintain the same. This order is challenged in 

 
FAO No. 72708 of 2023 
 
 
3 
the present appeal.  
4. 
Mr. Shehzada Muhammad Zeeshan Mirza, 
learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that the 
impugned order is against law and admittedly the second suit 
was based upon the order dated 21.05.2022 granting 
permission to withdraw first suit and file a fresh, which finally 
merged into the order of simpliciter dismissal as withdrawn; 
that the first suit since was dismissed without permission to file 
a fresh, the provision of Order II Rule 2 of CPC was required 
to be considered and applied to the case. Learned counsel for 
the appellant has also argued his case on the basis of principle 
of res judicata and he has stated that while deciding the matter 
the learned Tribunal has not even discussed Order II Rule 2 or 
Section 10 of CPC. In course of arguments learned counsel has 
relied upon various judgments, including the cases reported as 
“Trustees of the Port of Karachi Versus Organization of 
Karachi Port Trust Workers and Others” (2013 SCMR 238), 
“Ghulam Abbas and Others Versus Mohammad Shafi through 
LRs and Others” (2016 SCMR 1403), “Shahbaz Khan vs. 
Additional District Judge, Ferozewala and others” (2017 
SCMR 2005), “Khawaja Bashir Ahmed and Sons Pvt. Ltd. 
Versus Messrs Martrade Shipping and Transport and Others” 
(PLD 2021 Supreme Court 373), “Malik Ehsan Ullah etc. 
Versus Province of the Punjab etc.” (PLJ 2021 Lahore 352), 
“Nasir Ali vs. Muhammad Asghar” (2022 SCMR 1054) and 
“Kamilaaamir and another Versus Additional District & 
Session Judge and Others” (PLJ 2023 Lahore 735). It is 
added that very institution of the second suit was a part of the 
strategy of the respondent to defeat the justice, to wriggle out 
of the bar of Order II Rule 2 of CPC, which is against the 
intent of the legislature behind the said provision.   
5. 
Mr. Muhammad Shakeel Abid, learned counsel 
for the respondent, has opposed this appeal and he has argued 

 
FAO No. 72708 of 2023 
 
 
4 
that the learned Tribunal has correctly concluded that Order 
XXIII of CPC restricts filing of fresh suit and mere reading of 
wording of the said Order of CPC makes it amply clear that the 
bar is only applicable when the subsequent suit is filed after 
withdrawing the earlier suit, whereas, in the present case the 
second suit was pending at the time of dismissal of the first 
suit; that the law envisages that upon decision of an earlier 
suit, a fresh suit cannot be instituted, however, pending suit 
can be adjudicated on its merits. Learned counsel has relied 
upon cases titled “Ghulam Nabi and others vs. Seth 
Muhammad Yaqub and others” (PLD 1983 SC 344) and “The 
Commissioner of Income Tax N.C.A. Circle, Karachi and 
another vs. Haji Ashfaq Ahmad Khan and 10 others” (PLD 
1973 SC 406). The learned counsel has further submitted that 
bar of Order II Rule 2 of CPC, in circumstances of the case, 
are subject to Order XXIII Rule 1 of CPC.  
6. 
The arguments are heard and the available 
documents have been perused. 
7. 
The pivotal questions emerging from the 
arguments of the learned counsel of the parties are:  
(a) If the second suit, which was pending at the 
time of unconditional dismissal as withdrawn of 
the first suit, is liable to be rejected under the bar 
contained in Order XXIII Rule 1(3) of CPC? 
(b) If the very institution of the second suit was 
just a ploy to defeat the interest of justice or the 
object of the above provisions?  
The arguments made in this regard require discussion 
regarding the provisions of Order II Rule 2 and Order XXIII 
Rule 1 of CPC, which read: -  
 
Order II Rule 2: 
           
“2. Suit to include the whole 

 
FAO No. 72708 of 2023 
 
 
5 
claim.--(1) Every suit shall include the 
whole of the claim which the plaintiff is 
entitled to make in respect of the cause of 
action; but a plaintiff may relinquish any 
portion of his claim in order to bring the 
suit within the jurisdiction of any Court. 
 (2) 
Relinquishment of part of 
claim.--Where a plaintiff omits to sue in 
respect of, or intentionally relinquishes, 
any portion of his claim, he shall not 
afterwards sue in respect of the portion so 
omitted or relinquished. 
(3)  Omission to sue for one of 
several reliefs.--A person entitled to more 
than one relief in respect of the same cause 
of action may sue for all or any of such 
reliefs; but if he omits, except with the 
leave of the Court, to sue for all such 
reliefs, he shall not afterwards sue for any 
relief so omitted.  
  
Explanation.---For 
the 
purposes of this rule an obligation and a 
collateral security for its performance and 
successive claims arising under the same 
obligation shall be deemed respectively to 
constitute but one cause of action” 
 
 
 
Order XXIII Rule 1: 
  
 
“1. Withdrawal of suit or 
abandonment of part of claim. (1) At any 
time after the institution of a suit the 
plaintiff may, as against all or any of the 
defendants, withdraw his suit or abandon 
part of his claim. 
 
 
(2) 
Where 
the 
Court 
is 
satisfied- 
 
  
(a) that a suit must fail by 
reason of some formal defect, or 
 
   
(b) 
that 
there 
are 
other 
sufficient grounds for allowing the plaintiff 
to institute a fresh suit for the subject-
matter of a suit or part of a claim, it may, 
on such terms as it thinks fit, grant the 
plaintiff permission to withdraw from such 
suit or abandon such part of a claim with 
liberty to institute a fresh suit in respect of 
the subject-matter of such suit or such part 
of a claim. 

 
FAO No. 72708 of 2023 
 
 
6 
 
 
(3) 
Where 
the 
plaintiff 
withdraws from a suit, or abandons part of 
a claim, without the permission referred to 
in sub-rule(2), he shall be liable for such 
costs as the Court may award and shall be 
precluded from instituting any fresh suit 
in respect of such subject-matter or such 
part of the claim. 
 
 
(4) Nothing in this rule shall 
be deemed to authorize the Court to permit 
one of several plaintiffs to withdraw 
without the consent of the others. 
 
 
 
     (Emphasis supplied) 
 
8. 
 Order II Rule 1 of CPC requires every suit to 
include whole claim in respect of the cause of action in one 
suit. Claimants are permitted to relinquish any portion of their 
respective claims. Order II Rule 2 of CPC provides that where 
a plaintiff omits to sue in respect of or intentionally relinquish, 
any portion of his claim, he shall not afterwards sue in respect 
of the portion so omitted or relinquished. Order II Rule 3 of 
CPC requires leave of the Court, to sue for the claim that the 
plaintiff was entitled but he omitted, provided his case is 
covered thereunder. However, Order XXIII, Rule 1(3) of the 
CPC reads that where the plaintiff withdraws from a suit, or 
abandons part of a claim, without the permission under sub-
rule 2, he shall be precluded from instituting any fresh suit. 
 9. 
Ample deliberations have been made by the 
Courts of Sub-continent as to the collective wisdom of the 
above reproduced provisions and when facing the situation that 
earlier suit is withdrawn after instituting a subsequent one. In 
case titled “Karamat Ali Khan and another Versus Sardar Ali 
and 29 Others” (PLD 2001 Supreme Court (AJ&K) 30) an 
approach was adopted by the Supreme Court of AJ&K that in 
the absence of the permission to institute a new suit, even if the 
subsequent was pending at the time of withdrawal of previous, 
permitting to maintain the same shall amount to defeat the 
provisions in question. The relevant part reads:- 

 
FAO No. 72708 of 2023 
 
 
7 
“In the instant case neither there was  a 
prayer on the part of plaintiffs-respondents 
that on account of formal defects in the 
former suit the permission may be granted 
to institute the fresh suit nor the permission 
to institute the fresh suit was granted to 
plaintiffs-respondents, 
thus 
in 
our 
considered view the first suit which was 
filed in 1975 stood withdrawn by the 
plaintiffs-respondents vide order of the trial 
Court 
dated 
29-8-1988, 
while 
the 
subsequent suit filed in 1979 without 
seeking the permission of the Court to 
institute the fresh suit is hit by the 
provisions of Order XXIII, sub-rule (3). In 
the instant case the subsequent suit was 
filed during the pendency of the former suit 
and the prayer for withdrawing the first suit 
was made after so many years. Even the 
prayer was for withdrawal of suit not to 
reinstitute the fresh suit but to introduce an 
amendment in the subsequent suit. The 
principle which we have laid down that in 
presence of first suit the subsequent suit 
without the permission of Court to 
reinstitute the first suit on the basis of 
formal defects squarely applies to cases 
which are being withdrawn. The provisions 
of Order XXIII, sub-rule (3) cannot be 
defeated by instituting a fresh suit before 
withdrawing the previously filed suit. It is 
well-settled principle of law that what is not 
allowed to be done directly cannot be 
allowed to be done indirectly. Therefore, 
sub-rule (3) mentioned above applies to the 
present case.” 
   (Underlining is added) 
 
  
  
Later, the Supreme Court of AJ&K, in case titled 
“Shabina Kousar Versus Nargis Khatoon and 11 Others” 
(2017 CLC 822 Supreme Court (AJ&K)), could not succeed 
to find support of “Karamat Ali Khan and another” case 
(supra) because of absence of any clear provision and 
concluded that a party cannot be non-suited on presumptive or 
non-speaking wisdom of the legislature by any stretch of 

 
FAO No. 72708 of 2023 
 
 
8 
imagination or interpretation of statute. Paragraph 10 of the 
judgment reads as follows: - 
“10. The collective wisdom of all the 
Courts of sub-continent is supportive to the 
principle of law laid down in Muhammad 
Bashir Khan’s case [PLJ 2005 SC AJ&K) 
89]. Therefore, we have paid our utmost 
attention and also taken into consideration 
the relevant statutory provisions of Civil 
Procedure Code but could not succeed to 
find out any support in favour of the view 
adopted in Karamat Ali Khan’s case. The 
consensus of the legend jurists of the 
subcontinent is clear that if a suit is 
already pending and after filing of 
subsequent suit, the first suit is withdrawn, 
in such case, the provision of sub-rule (3) 
of rule 1 of Order XIII, C.P.C., precluding 
the plaintiff from instituting fresh suit is 
not applicable. This view appears to be 
most logical and just. Even otherwise, to 
non-suit a party is clear penalty and for 
imposing such penalty, there must be some 
clear expressed statutory provision. Thus, 
in 
absence 
of 
any 
clear 
statutory 
provision, a party cannot be non-suited on 
presumptive non-speaking wisdom of the 
legislature by any stretch of imagination 
or interpretation of statute.” 
 
       (Emphasis supplied)  
 
 10. 
 
In case titled “The Commissioner of Income Tax 
N.C.A. Circle, Karachi and another” (supra) the Honourable 
Supreme Court of Pakistan resolved that the bar of Order 
XXIII Rule 1 of the CPC does not apply where the subsequent 
suit was already pending before the previous suit is withdrawn. 
The relevant extract reads as follows:- 
  
“…In the case of Hira Singh v. 
Puran and another (1) it was held that the 
provisions of Order XXIII, rule 1 of the 
Code of Civil Procedure did not apply 
where the second suit was already pending 
on the date of the withdrawal of the first 
suit. With this view the High Court in the 
present case agreed. We agree with the 

 
FAO No. 72708 of 2023 
 
 
9 
views of the High Court. We do not think 
that in the facts and circumstances of the 
case Writ Petition No. 638 of 1962 was not 
maintainable. This view finds support from 
the decision in Daryao v. State of U.P. (2).”   
 
   
This view was reiterated by the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in “Ghulam Nabi and others” case (supra). The 
following part of the said judgment will be beneficial to be 
reproduced:- 
 
“….A fresh suit envisaged in the rule 
is one filed subsequent to the withdrawal of 
the earlier suit. On the question whether 
the rule barred a suit which at the time of 
the withdrawal of the earlier suit had 
already been instituted and pending, we 
find that in Ram Mal v. Upendra Datt (1) 
relying on P.Surja Reddi v. Subba Reddi 
(2), it was held that a second suit will not 
be barred in the case of withdrawal of a 
previous suit unless conditions of Order 
XXIII rule 1, C.P.C. are fully satisfied and 
that if the subsequent suit was already 
pending at the time of the withdrawal of 
the previous suit, the provisions could not 
be attracted. A Division Bench of the 
Lahore Court in Mungi Lal v. Radha 
Mohan (3) held that: 
 
“Order XXIII, rule 1 refers to 
permission to withdraw a suit with 
liberty to institute a fresh suit after 
the first one has been withdrawn. It 
appears to me that the section cannot 
be read so as to bar a suit which has 
already been instituted before the 
other suit had been abandoned or 
dismissed.” 
 
This judgment had been followed in 
Abdullah v. Bashiran Bibi (4) and it had 
been held that a fresh suit which had been 
pending at the time of withdrawal of a 
previous suit was not barred. The view 
taken in Mungi Lal’s case had also been 
followed by this Court in Commissioner of 
Income-tax v. Ashfaq Ahmad (5), wherein it 
had been held that where one writ petition 
had been filed during the pendency of a 

 
FAO No. 72708 of 2023 
 
 
10 
previous writ petition, the withdrawal of the 
previous writ petition before reaching the 
stage of hearing on merit would not affect 
the maintainability of the second petition 
which could legally proceed in spite of the 
withdrawal of the previous petition. The 
Sindh High Court has also been of the same 
view which is reflected in its judgments 
reported as Ashfaq Ahmad Khan v. 
Custodian of Evacuee Property (6) and 
Irshad Ali v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan 
(7). We are, therefore, not inclined to 
agree that the suit in question was affected 
by Order II, rule 2 or Order XXIII, rule 1, 
C.P.C.” 
                                     (Emphasis supplied) 
  
Further 
reference 
approving 
the 
above 
interpretation can be made to cases titled “Naveed Rukhsar 
and another Versus Muhammad Salim Lakhani” (2018 MLD 
401), “Vimlesh Kumari Kulshrestha v. Sambhajirao & Anr.” 
(AIR 2009 Supreme Court 806), “Mrs. Razia Ahmed and 
another Versus Karachi Building Control Authority through 
Chief Controller of Buildings, Karachi and 2 Others” (PLD 
2000 Karachi 288) and “Malik Zarin Khan Versus Adnan Ali 
Malik and 2 Others” (2023 CLC 1368). 
11.  
Shehzada Muhammad Zeeshan Mirza, learned 
counsel for the appellants, has shown some serious 
apprehensions, regarding the situation that the above resolution 
can result into successive suits on same cause and it can result 
into assistance to litigant, who with malafide can succeed in 
relentlessly vexing defender of one cause or same set of 
causes. He also specified that it is now not rare that even the 
pendency of the earlier cases is not disclosed in the subsequent 
and then if such litigants are allowed to maintain the 
subsequent suit after unconditional withdrawal of earlier, will 
defeat the ends of justice. A part of the arguments and 
interpretation put forth by the learned counsel for the 
appellants, find support from case titled “Virgo Industries 

 
FAO No. 72708 of 2023 
 
 
11 
(ENG.) Private Limited vs. Venturetech Solutions Private 
Limited” ((2013) 1 Supreme Court Cases 625), wherein the 
following has been observed: - 
          17. The learned Single Judge of the 
High Court had considered, and very 
rightly, to be bound to follow an earlier 
Division Bench order in R. Vimalchand v. 
Ramalingam holding that the provisions of 
Order 2 Rule 2 CPC would be applicable 
only when the first suit is disposed of. As in 
the present case the second set of suits were 
filed during the pendency of the earlier 
suits, it was held, on the ratio of the 
aforesaid decision of the Division Bench of 
the High Court, that the provisions of 
Order 2 Rule 2(3) will not be attracted. 
Judicial discipline required the learned 
Single Judge of the High Court to come to 
the aforesaid conclusion. However, we are 
unable to agree with the same in view of the 
object behind the enactment of the 
provisions of Order 2 Rule 2 CPC as 
already discussed by us, namely, that Order 
2 Rule 2 CPC seeks to avoid multiplicity of 
litigations on the same cause of action. If 
that is the true object of the law, on which 
we do not entertain any doubt, the same 
would not stand fully subserved by holding 
that the provisions of Order 2 Rule 2 CPC 
will apply only if the first suit is disposed of 
and not in a situation where the second suit 
has been filed during the pendency of the 
first suit. Rather, Order 2 Rule 2 CPC will 
apply to both the aforesaid situations. 
Though direct judicial pronouncements on 
the issue are somewhat scarce, we  find that 
a similar view had been taken in a decision 
of the High Court at Allahabad in Murti v. 
Bhola Ram and by the Bombay High Court 
in Krishnaji Ramchandra v. Raghunath 
Shankar.” 
 
 
 
 
           (Underlining is added) 
 
[  
  
 
 
12. 
 
In the present case, the learned Tribunal granted 
permission to the respondent to withdraw from the first suit 
and to file the second suit. This permission was granted by the 

 
FAO No. 72708 of 2023 
 
 
12 
learned Tribunal on 21.05.2022, upon which the second suit 
was filed on the same day. Though, the decision to grant 
permission to file a fresh suit was later recalled, after an order 
of remand dated 08.03.2023 passed by this Court in F.A.O No. 
46771 of 2022 but the respondent has not made any 
concealment in the entire proceedings. The second suit was 
filed with permission of the learned concerned Court as 
envisaged under Order XXIII of the CPC. I have not found any 
maliciousness on the part of the respondent to repeatedly vex 
the defender / appellant. The respondent, apparently, is only 
pursuing his alleged cause(s). Even otherwise, the view 
adopted by the learned Tribunal in the impugned order, is in 
accordance with principle of the law enunciated by the 
Supreme Court in the cases of “Ghulam Nabi and others” and 
“The Commissioner of Income Tax N.C.A. Circle, Karachi and 
another” (supra), which is binding on all the Courts in 
Pakistan, under Article 189 of the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973. Thus, this Court cannot hold 
differently, either. The position perhaps can be different if any 
malice is found floating on the surface in filing the subsequent 
suit and the such suit is filed merely with the object of 
subjecting a defender to manifold litigation and multiple suits.   
13. 
 
So far as the above discussed apprehension of Mr. 
Zeeshan Mirza (learned ASC) regarding successive suits by 
hiding the earlier case(s) or misuse of above interpretation of 
law with bad intention is concerned. It appears to me that one 
of the common principles engrafted in Order II as well as 
Order XXIII of CPC is that unless the Court is satisfied as to 
the reasons given in the relevant rules of the said Orders, the 
defenders should not be subjected to more than one suits for 
the same cause. It is significant to notice that in Order II Rule 2 
of CPC the legislature has used words where a plaintiff omits 
to sue… shall not afterwards sue. Likewise, Rule 2 of the said 

 
FAO No. 72708 of 2023 
 
 
13 
Order says that a person if entitled to more than one relief may 
sue for all or any of such relief, but if omits, except with the 
leave of the Court….he shall not afterwards sue for any relief 
so omitted. The word „afterwards’, in the above rules, is not 
used with reference to decision of cases. It is used with regard 
to the word “sue”, therefore, the relevant Courts, when the 
pendency of the earlier suit is disclosed, can control the 
situation by taking an action, at earliest. When it comes to the 
surface that filing earlier suit is not disclosed in the 
subsequent, the learned trial Courts are sufficiently empowered 
to curb and regulate such situation on account of non-
disclosure of fatal information as per law laid down in case 
titled “Asad Zaheer through Attorney Versus Muhammad 
Ismail and another” (2019 CLC 804).  
14. 
In the wake of above discussions, I am of the 
opinion that the learned Tribunal has adopted correct approach 
of the matter. This petition is, therefore, dismissed. No order as 
to costs.
