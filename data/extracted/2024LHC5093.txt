Faisal Zaman Khan, J:-  Through this civil revision order and 
decree dated 28.05.2022 and judgment and decree dated 29.03.2023 
passed by the learned Civil Judge, Khanpur and learned Additional 
District Judge, Khanpur, respectively, have been assailed. By virtue 
of the former order the suit of the petitioner has been dismissed under 
Order VII Rule 11 CPC and through the latter judgment the same has 
been upheld. 
2. 
Succinctly, the facts of the case are that in order to assail 
multiple mutations of gift etc. petitioner instituted a suit for 
declaration alongwith permanent injunction against the respondents, 
in which respondent Nos.1 to 3, 6 to 8 and 10 to 16 filed their written 
statement denying the claim of the petitioner whereas respondent Nos. 
4, 5 and 9 filed conceding written statements, whereafter, on 
28.05.2022 when the case was fixed for argument on the application 
for temporary injunction, the learned trial court while invoking the 

C.R.No.408 of 2023/BWP 
2 
provisions of Order VII Rule 11 CPC rejected the plaint being barred 
by time. Feeling aggrieved, petitioner preferred an appeal, which also 
met the same fate and was dismissed vide judgment and decree dated 
29.03.2023, hence, this civil revision.  
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that when the plaint 
was rejected the case was fixed for argument on an application under 
Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 CPC and the maintainability of the suit 
was not in question before the trial court at that point in time, 
therefore, the trial court was supposed to decide the application for 
temporary injunction first, however, without confronting the 
petitioner with the fact that the suit is not maintainable, the same could 
not have been dismissed. Further adds that on the date when the plaint 
was rejected, it was not a date of hearing for the purposes of 
maintainability of the suit, thus, no order qua maintainability of the 
suit could be passed. Places reliance on judgments reported as Tariq 
Mahmood Chaudhry, Kamboh v. Najam un Din (1999 SCMR 2396), 
Mst. Hameedan Bibi and others v. Ch. Atta Ullah (1999 SCMR 
2266),  Qazi Muhammad Tariq v. Hasin Jahan and 3 others (1993 
SCMR 1949), Hashim Khan v. National Bank of Pakistan (1992 
SCMR 707), Munawar Ali and others v. Umar Daraz and others 
(2022 CLC 920), Mujahidabad Welfare and Development 
Organization Jutal through Members v. Provincial Government 
through Chief Secretary Gilgit-Baltistan and others (2022 YLR 565), 
Mst. Khanai and 4 others v. Ghulam Rasool and 9 others (2022 CLC 
433), Shahid Mashmood v. Mehtab Khan (PLD 2015 Lahore 71) and 
Mushtaq Hussain v. Province of Punjab through Collector Jhelum 
District and 6 others (2003 MLD 109). 
4. 
Replying to the above, learned counsel for the respondents 
submits that it is the foremost duty of the courts to look into the 
question of maintainability of the suit including the question of 
limitation and thereupon proceed with the suit, therefore, the trial 
court has rightly invoked its powers under Order VII Ruel 11 CPC 

C.R.No.408 of 2023/BWP 
3 
while rejecting the plaint on the ground of limitation, thus, the 
impugned order/judgment and decrees are in accordance with law. He 
places reliance on judgments reported as Syed Kausar Ali Shah and 
others v. Syed Farhat Hussain Shah and others (2022 SCMR 1558), 
Mst. Rabia Gula and others v. Muhammad Janan and others (2022 
SCMR 1009), Salamat Ali and others v. Muhammad Din and others 
(PLD 2022 S.C. 353), Faqir Ali and others v. Sakina Bibi and others 
(PLD 2022 S.C. 85), Nasir Fahimuddin and others v. Charles Philips 
Mills and others (2017 SCMR 468), Agha Syed Mushtaque Ali Shah 
v. Mst. Bibi Gul Jab and others (2016 SCMR 910), Muhammad 
Rustam and another v. Mst. Makhan Jan and others (2013 SCMR

Biuilders (Pvt.) Ltd. Karachi (2009 YLR 451), Asghar Ali v. P.K. 
Shahani and 2 others (1992 CLC 2282) and Muhammad Shafi v. 
Punjab Province through Collector, Vehari and another (1982 CLC 
55). 
5. 
Despite service, none has entered appearance on behalf of 
respondent Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 9, therefore, they are proceeded against  
ex parte. 
6. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
7. 
From the perusal of the available record, it transpires that on 
28.05.2022 the case was fixed before the trial court for arguments on 

C.R.No.408 of 2023/BWP 
4 
the application for temporary injunction and not for determining the 
question of maintainability of the suit on the point of limitation. 
8. 
It has been held in judgments reported as Jewan and 7 others 
v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Revenue, Islamabad and 
2 others (1994 SCMR 826), Shahid Iftikhar and another v. Mst. 
Tasneem Rani and 4 others (2017 CLC 264), Muhammad Saeed v. 
Syed Muhammad Baqir Bukhari and 2 others [2017 CLC (NOTE) 
153], Mst. Amina v. Muhammad Easa and 11 others (2008 YLR 
1405), Iftikharul Haq v. District Canal Officer and others (2005 CLC 
1740), Muhammad Tariq Mahmood and 2 others v. Anjuman 
Kashmiri Bradari Khisht Faroshan through President Abdul Ashfaq 
and 21 others (2003 CLC 335), Mushtaq Hussain v. Province of 
Punjab through Collector Jhelum District and 6 others (2003 MLD 
109), Hakim Ali v. Muhammad Amin and 2 others (1981 CLC 673), 
Mst. Zainab Jan v. Abdul Rashid (1981 CLC 1012), Amtul Batool and 
another v. Qamar Sultana (PLD 1980 Lahore 647) and Mst. 
Khurshid Begum and 7 others v. Inam Rabbani and another (1979 
CLC 570) that it is improper to reject a plaint while deciding an 
application for temporary injunction for the reason that there is a 
material difference in the scope of Order VII Rule 11 and Order 
XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 CPC as while exercising jurisdiction under the 
former provision, the Court will have to decide whether there is any 
cause of action or the suit is barred by law whereas while deciding 
under the latter provision, the Court will only see prima facie case, 
balance of convenience and irreparable loss. 
9. 
There is no cavil to the proposition that the courts have ample 
power to look into the question of maintainability of the suit under 
Order VII Rule 11 CPC or the question of limitation keeping in view 
Section 3 of the Limitation Act, 1908, however, it is the foremost duty 
of the court to apply these provisions at the outset when the suit is 
filed, however, once the court decides to proceed with the suit and 
issue notice to the other side then the court without affording an 

C.R.No.408 of 2023/BWP 
5 
opportunity to the plaintiff to address the question of maintainability 
of the suit including the point of limitation should not decide the same, 
merely because an objection is raised by the other side, which is only 
a contention and not conclusive as no adjudication is made or the 
court has a change of heart and it wants to re-consider its previous 
decision of entertaining the suit, as in such eventuality if without 
putting the plaintiff on notice an order of rejection of plaint is passed 
it will violate/militate the mandate of Article 10-A of the Constitution 
of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the rule of audi altrem partem.  
10. 
Another circumstance for deciding the maintainability of the 
suit can be that defendant files an application under Order VII Rule 
11 CPC upon which the plaintiff can be put to notice and thereupon 
the fate of the suit could be decided or after the framing of the issues, 
the issue of the maintainability of the suit can be treated as 
preliminary issue under Order XIV Rule 2 and decided at the outset, 
however, in both the circumstances the court has to put the plaintiff 
to notice for decision of such question.  
11. 
It is cardinal principle of law that for rejection of a plaint only 
its contents are to be seen and no other document can be considered. 
An exception to the rule is that the documents, which are admitted 
between the parties can be looked into by the court while exercising 
its power under Order VII Rule 11 CPC. For reference, reliance is 
placed on judgments reported as Haji Abdul Karim and others v. 
Messrs Florida Builders (Pvt.) Limited (PLD 2012 SC 247), Mrs. 
Anis Haider and others v. S. Amir Haider and others (2008 SCMR 
236) and Abdul Waheed v. Mst. Ramzanu and others (2006 SCMR 
489). 
12. 
It has also been held by the Apex Court that question of 
limitation is a mixed question of law and facts, which can only be 
resolved after recording of evidence of the parties. Reliance can be 
placed on judgments reported as Messrs Anwar Textile Mills Limited 

C.R.No.408 of 2023/BWP 
6 
v. Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited and others (2013 
SCMR 1570), Haji Abdul Sattar and others v. Farooq Inayat and 
others (2013 SCMR 1493), Collector of Customs E & S.T. and Sales 
Tax v. Pakistan State Oil Company Ltd. (2005 SCMR 1636), Tariq 
Mahmood Chaudhry, Kamboh v. Najam un Din (1999 SCMR 2396), 
Government of the Punjab through Secretary, Education, Lahore v. 
Shahida Begum (1994 SCMR 1488) and Irshad Ali v. Sajjad Ali and 
4 others (PLD 1995 SC 629). 
13. 
In the above backdrop, from the perusal of the contents of the 
plaint, it is evident that it is the case of the petitioner/plaintiff that the 
mutations in dispute are fraudulent and came to her knowledge 2/3 
months before filing of the suit and the said contention was 
acknowledged by respondent Nos.4, 5 and 9 while filing their 
conceding written statements, therefore, the trial court was obligated 
to determine the said questions for which evidence was definitely 
required instead of rejecting the plaint merely on the ground that since 
the person on whose behest the mutations in dispute were sanctioned 
did not challenge the same during his life time as it is yet to be 
proved/decided that such person was even aware of sanctioning of 
mutations. 
14. 
Perusal of the case law on the subject mentioned supra and 
placing the same in juxtaposition with the facts of the present case, 
makes it abundantly clear that both the courts below erred in law in 
interpreting Order VII Rule 11 CPC. Since the questions upon which 
the plaint was rejected were disputed and factual in nature and the 
same could not have been resolved without putting both the parties to 
notice and recording of evidence, therefore, for the purpose of 
rejecting the plaint under Order VII Rule 11 CPC and keeping in view 
the case law mentioned in paragraph No.10 supra, the learned trial 
court was supposed to look into the contents of the plaint only and 
could not have decided about the maintainability of the suit on the 
point of limitation, which is mixed question of law and facts in view 

C.R.No.408 of 2023/BWP 
7 
of the case law mentioned in paragraph No.11 supra, which it failed 
to do.  
15. 
Even otherwise, from the perusal of the available record, it is 
manifest that on 28.05.2022 the suit was not fixed for deciding the 
question of maintainability of the suit on the point of limitation, rather 
the same was fixed only for deciding the application for temporary 
injunction, therefore, without confronting the petitioner being 
plaintiff regarding the question of maintainability of the suit on the 
ground of limitation or giving him an opportunity to defend himself, 
on mere argument of the other side that too on the application of 
temporary injunction, the plaint could not have been rejected.  
16. 
In the attending circumstances, the proper course available to 
the trial court was to have decided the application of temporary 
injunction, framed the issues and treated the issues of maintainability 
of the suit and limitation as preliminary as contemplated in Order XIV 
Rule 2 CPC and decide the same at the outset (with or without 
recording of evidence). 
17. 
Last but not the least, if the trial court was convinced that the 
suit was not maintainable it could have fixed the case for arguments 
on maintainability of the suit so that parties should get an opportunity 
to defend themselves. 
18. 
In the above perspective, this Court is of the view that since the 
contents of the plaint make out a prima facie case as it was the case of 
the petitioner that disputed mutations were fraudulent, that the 
predecessor of the parties never appeared before the revenue 
authorities for sanctioning of mutations, ingredients of gift were not 
complete and the donor was incapacitated to make a gift which were 
conceded to by respondent Nos.4, 5 and 9 in their written statements, 
therefore, there was no occasion for the trial court to have rejected the 
plaint at the outset that too on the question of limitation especially so 
when the suit was not listed for hearing so as to determine the question 

C.R.No.408 of 2023/BWP 
8 
of maintainability of the suit as the case was fixed for arguments on 
an application for temporary injunction, hence, the impugned order/ 
judgment and decrees cannot sustain.  
19. 
As regards the judgments referred by the learned counsel for 
the respondents, the same having different facts and circumstances are 
not applicable to the case in hand. Moreover, they may have some 
impact, as and when the court considers the question of 
maintainability of the suit after putting the parties to notice. 
20. 
For what has been discussed above, this civil revision is 
allowed as a sequel to which the impugned order/judgment and 
decrees are set aside resultantly the suit filed by the petitioner shall be 
deemed to be pending before the trial court, who shall decide the same 
in accordance with the observations made in this judgment.
