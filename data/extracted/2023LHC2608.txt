Barrister Salman Safdar and Mr Intazar Hussain Panjhuta, 
Advocates, with the Petitioner. 
 
M/s Muhammad Mustafa Chaudhry, Rai Asif Mehmood 
and Humayun Aslam, Deputy Prosecutors General. 
 
Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – The Petitioner, Imran Ahmad 
Khan Niazi, is a former Prime Minister of Pakistan. He is wanted in 
case FIR No.242/2023 dated 14.3.2023 registered at Police Station 
Khannah, District Islamabad, for offences under sections 341, 353, 186, 
506, 109, 188, 153, 290 & 382 PPC and sections 11(x) & 21(i) of The 
Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. On 17.3.2023, he applied to this Court for 
protective/transitory bail in the aforesaid FIR through Crl. Misc. 
No.18452/B/2023. This Court acceded to his request and, by order of 
even date, admitted him to protective bail until 12:30 p.m. on 
24.3.2023. The Petitioner was required to approach the appropriate 
court for (regular) pre-arrest bail by that time. He has now filed this 
application with this Court requesting an extension of the above-
mentioned time. 
2. 
 
The office has objected to the maintainability of this 
application. According to it, protective bail is a one-time grace. No rule 
or practice allows for filing a second application or an extension of 
time granted in the first. 
3. 
 
The Deputy Prosecutors General have supported the office 
objection. 
4. 
 
In response, Barrister Salman Safdar has argued that the 
incumbent Government is politically victimizing the Petitioner. It has 
opened floodgates of vexatious cases. About 100 FIRs have been 
registered against him so far across the country. The motive is to 
sabotage his election campaign. Despite this, the counsel submits that 
the Petitioner has appeared before the courts in various cases,

demonstrating his bona fides. He contends that extraordinary 
circumstances in the present case warrant the grant of protective 
bail/extension of the time limit for which this Court has ample powers. 
Determination 
5. 
 
It might be useful to start with a few words about the right 
to access to justice. Historically, It has been interpreted in different 
ways. The narrowest definition of “access to justice” comes from 
liberal states of the 18th and 19th centuries and refers to an individual’s 
legal right to prosecute or defend. In the 1960s, the definitions of 
access to justice focused on “practising law for poor people”. The 
objective was to provide legal representation to low-income people 
who could not afford it. It sought to reduce the legal system’s expense, 
time, and complexity, which is still the foundation for legal aid and 
poverty law clinics today.1 
6. 
 
Since the 1980s, the concept of equality has prompted a 
change in perspective on access to justice, leading to a more expansive 
outlook. This approach goes beyond equal access for the disadvantaged 
and marginalized litigants and seeks to achieve equality of outcomes by 
removing barriers to accessing the legal system. Remedies include 
reforming and streamlining various aspects of the legal system and 
other social institutions to develop a more holistic service model. This 
approach combines different approaches, such as using simplified court 
procedures, alternative dispute resolution, and other preventative 
measures to solve legal problems before they reach the litigation stage.2 
7. 
 
The modern concept of “access to justice” calls for 
societal change beyond the legal realm. It urges the justice system to 
collaborate holistically with communities and governments to solve 
legal problems. It emphasizes the need to shift away from court-centric 
and lawyer-centric practices towards a more client-centric strategy that 
focuses on resolving the daily challenges of the community members.3

According to Byrnes et al., access to justice, also 
sometimes referred to as the right to “access justice”, is “a cross-cutting 
right that must be understood and interpreted in line with other 
principles, such as equal recognition before the law, which enables and 
enhances other rights.”4 The United States Institute of Peace states that 
access to justice is more than improving an individual’s access to the 
courts or ensuring legal representation. Access to justice is defined as 
the ability of the people to seek and secure a remedy for grievances in 
accordance with human rights principles through formal or informal 
institutions of justice. There is no access to justice when people 
(especially marginalized groups) fear the legal system, perceive it as an 
alien, and do not use it; when the justice system is financially out of 
reach; when individuals lack access to lawyers; when they are unaware 
of their rights; or when the justice system is weak. Access to justice 
includes legal protection, awareness, legal aid and advice, adjudication, 
enforcement, and civil society oversight. It fosters long-term peace by 
offering a more appealing alternative to violence in resolving personal 
and political disputes.5

Nations development agenda. The Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) at Goal 16 prescribe 12 targets, each with its own indicators. 
Target 16.3 envisages promoting the rule of law at the national and 
international levels and ensuring equal access to justice for all. The 
indicators of Target 16.3 include (a) the proportion of victims of 
violence in the previous 12 months who reported their victimization to 
competent authorities or other officially recognized conflict resolution 
mechanisms (16.3.1); and (b) un-sentenced detainees as a proportion of 
the overall prison population (16.3.2).7 
10. 
 
Access to justice is inextricably linked to the rule of law. 
Without access to justice, people cannot have their voices heard, 
exercise their rights, challenge discrimination or hold decision-makers 
accountable. The OHCHR has described the relationship between 
access to justice and the rule of law as follows:  
“Access to justice is a core element of the rule of law. It is a 
fundamental right and prerequisite for protecting and promoting all 
other human rights. Access to justice encompasses the right to a fair 
trial, including equal access to and equality before the courts, and 
seeking and obtaining just and timely remedies for rights violations. 
Guaranteeing access to justice is indispensable to democratic 
governance, the rule of law, and to combat social and economic 
marginalization.” 
11. 
 
Lord Reed JSC (with whom the rest of the Supreme Court 
agreed) considered the importance of the rule of law and the role of 
access to justice in maintaining the rule of law in R (UNISON) v Lord 
Chancellor [2017] UKSC 51; [2017] 3 WLR 409 at [68]. He stated: 
“At the heart of the concept of the rule of law is the idea that society 
is governed by law. Parliament exists primarily in order to make 
laws for society in this country. Democratic procedures exist 
primarily in order to ensure that the Parliament which makes those 
laws includes Members of Parliament who are chosen by the people 
of this country and are accountable to them. Courts exist to ensure 
that the laws made by Parliament, and the common law created by 
the courts themselves, are applied and enforced. That role includes 
ensuring that the executive branch of government carries out its 
                                                 
7 See note 4. 

Crl. Misc. No.19997/B/2023

functions in accordance with the law. In order for the courts to 
perform that role, people must, in principle, have unimpeded access 
to them. Without such access, laws are liable to become a dead 
letter, the work done by Parliament may be rendered nugatory, and 
the democratic election of Members of Parliament may become a 
meaningless charade …” 
12. 
 
In R (1) FB (Afghanistan) and (2) Medical Justice v 
Secretary of State for the Home Department [2020] EWCA Civ 1338, 
Lord Justice Hickinbottom said that the right to access to justice is an 
inevitable result of the rule of law. As such, it is a fundamental 
principle in any democratic society that supports and protects larger 
procedural fairness rights. 
13. 
 
The U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to legal redress. 
The 14th Amendment states that no state shall make or enforce any law 
limiting the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States. It 
also prohibits the states from depriving any person of life, liberty, or 
property without due process of law; or denying the equal protection of 
the laws to any person within their respective jurisdictions. In Marbury 
v. Madison (1803) 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, Chief Justice Marshal stated 
that “the very essence of civil liberty consists in the right of every 
individual to claim the protection of laws, whenever he receives an 
injury. One of the first duties of government is to afford that protection. 
In Great Britain, the King himself is sued in the respectful form of a 
petition, and he never fails to comply with the judgment of his court.” 
14. 
 
In England, it is argued, the right of access to justice is 
rooted in common law, but Magna Carta (1215) formally committed 
to it. Blackstone wrote in his Commentaries, 4th ed (1876), 111:  
“A … right of every [man] is that of applying to the courts of justice 
for redress of injuries. Since the law is in England the supreme 
arbiter of every man’s life, liberty and property, courts of justice 
must at all times be open to the subject and the law be duly 
administered therein.”  In R v. Secretary of State for the Home 
Department ex parte Leech, [1994] QB 198, Steyn LJ held that “it is 
a principle of our law that every citizen has a right of unimpeded 
access to a court.” In R v. Lord Chancellor ex parte Wiltham  
[1998] QB 575, Laws J. held that the common law protects the 
citizen’s right to access the courts as if it were a constitutional right.

Hence, it cannot be restricted without an Act of Parliament. In 
Attorney General v Times Newspapers Ltd. [1974] AC 273, Lord 
Diplock made the following important statement on p. 309:  
“My Lords, in any civilized society, it is a function of government to 
maintain the courts of law to which its citizens can have access for 
impartial decision of disputes as to their legal rights and obligations 
towards one another individually and towards the state as 
representing society as a whole ... The due administration of justice 
requires first that all citizens should have unhindered access to the 
constitutionally established courts of criminal or civil jurisdiction 
for the determination of disputes as to their legal rights and 
liabilities; secondly, that they should be able to rely upon obtaining 
in the courts the arbitrament of a tribunal which is free from bias 
against any party and whose decision will be based upon those facts 
only that have been proved in the evidence adduced before it in 
accordance with the procedure adopted in the courts of law; and 
thirdly that, once the dispute has been submitted to a court of law, 
they should be able to rely upon there being no usurpation by any 
other person of the function of that court to decide it according to 
law.”  
15. 
 
Pakistan’s Constitution of 1973 does not specifically 
mention the term “access to justice.” However, it has always been 
considered one of the basic constitutional values and a part of various 
enumerated fundamental rights. In Miss Benazir Bhutto v. Federation 
of Pakistan and another (PLD 1988 SC 416), Muhammad Haleem, CJ. 
observed that access to justice for everyone is not only an 
internationally recognized human right but has also gained 
constitutional importance because it provides a broad-based remedy for 
human rights breaches. It also promotes socio-economic justice, which 
is critical in advancing the national hopes and aspirations of the people 
permeating the Constitution and the basic values incorporated therein.8  
16. 
 
In Government of Balochistan through Additional Chief 
Secretary v. Azizullah Memon and others (PLD 1993 SC 341), the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan approvingly cited the following excerpt 
from Sharaf Faridi and others v. The Federation of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan through Prime Minister of Pakistan and another (PLD 1989 
Karachi 404), a case decided by 7-Member Bench of the Sindh High 
Court: 
“The right of ‘access to justice to all’ is a well-recognized inviolable 
right enshrined in Article 9 of the Constitution. This right is equally 
found in the doctrine of ‘due process of law’. The right to access to 
                                                 
8 These observations were approvingly cited in Sh. Riaz-ul-Haq and another v. Federation of Pakistan through the 
Ministry of Law and others (PLD 2013 SC 501).  

Crl. Misc. No.19997/B/2023 
 
7 
 
 
justice includes the right to be treated according to law, the right to 
have a fair and proper trial and a right to have an impartial court or 
tribunal. This conclusion finds support from the observation of 
Willoughby in the Constitution of the United States, Second Edition, 
Vol. II at page 1709, where the term ‘due process of law’ has been 
summarized as follows: (1) He shall have due notice of the 
proceedings which affect his rights. (2) He shall be given a 
reasonable opportunity to defend. (3) That the tribunal or court 
before which his rights are adjudicated is so constituted as to give 
reasonable assurance of his honesty and impartiality, and (4) That it 
is a court of competent jurisdiction.” 
17. 
 
According to Azizullah Memon, the right of access to 
justice is enshrined in Article 9 of the Constitution. In Aftab Shahban 
Mirani v. President of Pakistan and others (1998 SCMR 1863), the 
Supreme Court held that it is included in Article 4 (Right of individuals 
to be dealt with in accordance with the law), and forms a part of the 
right to a fair trial. In our opinion, it can also be read into Article 14 
(right to dignity). 
18. 
 
The insertion of Article 10A by the Constitution 
(Eighteenth Amendment) Act, 2010, has made the right of access to 
justice a more robust right. We draw on Golden v. United Kingdom, 
(1975) 1 EHRR 524, for this holding in which the European Court of 
Human Rights interpreted Article 6(1) of the European Convention on 
Human Rights,9 whose first part is very similar to Article 10A of our 
Constitution. It ruled that “the right of access constitutes an element 
which is inherent in the right stated by Article 6 para 1 (art. 6-1). This 
is not an extensive interpretation forcing new obligations on the 
Contracting States: it is based on the very terms of the first sentence of 
Article 6 para 1 (art. 6-1) read in its general context and having regard 
to the object and purpose of the Convention, a lawmaking treaty … and 
to the general principles of law.” The U.K. Supreme Court approvingly 
cited the aforesaid case in Benkharbouche v Secretary of State for 
Foreign & Commonwealth Affairs, [2017] UKSC 62, adding that the 
                                                 
9 Article 6 para 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights is as follows: 
6. 
Right to a fair trial.– (1) In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal 
charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an 
independent and impartial tribunal established by law. Judgment shall be pronounced publicly but the press 
and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interests of morals, public order or national 
security in a democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the 
parties so require, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where 
publicity would prejudice the interests of justice. 

Crl. Misc. No.19997/B/2023

“right to a court” corresponds to a right which the common law has 
recognized for more than two centuries. 
19. 
 
Life and personal liberty are an individual’s most 
cherished possessions. Life is not worth living without honour and 
dignity. Since arrest and detention greatly impact one’s life, 
comprehensive principles have evolved to protect the people from the 
excesses of State authority. This has also given rise to the concept of 
bail. According to American Jurisprudence, Second Edition (2009), 
Volume 8A, pages 298 - 300, bail aims to allow an accused to answer a 
charge without restricting his liberty and violating his right to be 
presumed innocent until proven guilty. Its goal is to dissuade the 
accused from fleeing and ensure his presence at trial while 
simultaneously allowing him to prepare his defence. Another view is 
that the purpose of a pretrial bail is to prevent punishment before 
conviction. 
20. 
 
There is no provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
1898 (Cr.P.C.),  for protective/transitory bail. Still, the High Courts in 
our country have invoked section 561-A Cr.P.C. and Article 199 of the 
Constitution to accommodate the accused and allow them to approach 
the court concerned for a remedy. The High Court does not touch the 
merits of the case while considering such requests. Thus, protective bail 
serves a specific purpose and is granted for a fixed time. It is not the 
same as anticipatory or pre-arrest bail granted under section 498 
Cr.P.C. When the accused appears before the court concerned, it deals 
with him independently, and protective bail does not automatically 
entitle him to pre-arrest bail. In Naseer Ahmed and another v. The 
State (2009 PCr.LJ 1430), a learned Single Judge of this Court held 
that protective bail merely restrains the police from arresting the 
accused for a certain period. So, technically it is not bail. 
21. 
 
The concept of protective/transitory bail must be 
considered within the context of the constitutional rights to liberty, 
dignity, access to justice, a fair trial, and the right to be treated in 
accordance with the law. The accused person is deprived of these rights 
if protective bail is denied. The courts are the guardians of the people’s 

Crl. Misc. No.19997/B/2023 
 
9 
 
 
fundamental rights, and Article 199 of the Constitution empowers the 
High Courts to issue appropriate directions for their enforcement.10  
22. 
 
The history of protective bail shows that the High Courts 
were initially hesitant in entertaining applications for it, but as time 
progressed, they became liberal. Lately, they have also given the 
accused relief in respect of an offence committed in a province other 
than the one over which they have jurisdiction.11 In Malik Azmat Ullah 
v. Federation of Pakistan and others (2023 PCr.LJ 290), this Court 
held that if a person from outside Pakistan wishes to surrender before 
the country’s court(s) to face any criminal proceedings pending against 
him, the High Court has the authority to protect him from arrest on 
arrival and afford him transitory bail.12  
23. 
 
We have not come across any reported judgment or order 
addressing the issue of whether a second application for protective bail 
is competent or whether the High Court can extend the time granted in 
the first. Hence, we take the present case as one of first impression. 
24. 
 
As adumbrated, the concept of protective/transitory bail is 
rooted in fundamental rights. Therefore, the High Court cannot short-
shrift an accused’s second request. It must judicially assess and 
determine if he has legitimate grounds to justify it. The High Court 
should ensure that the accused does not obstruct the investigation by 
playing hide and seek with the criminal justice system. 
25. 
 
Let’s now see what the Petitioner has to say in the present 
case. He submits that on 17.3.2023, he applied to this Court for 
protective bail in FIR No.242/2023, supra, and four other cases 
(through Crl. Misc. Nos. 18448/B/2023, 18449/B/2023, 18453/B/2023 
& 18454/B/2023) which was allowed until 12:30 p.m. of the 24th. The 
following day, on 18.3.2023, he travelled to the Judicial Complex, 
                                                 
10 Malik Azmat Ullah v. Federation of Pakistan and others (2023 PCr.LJ 290). 
11 Ch. Allah Ditta v. The State (1989 PCr.LJ 2152); Malik Mukhtar Ahmad Awan v. The State (1990 PCr.LJ 617); 
Sabir Hussain and others v. The State (1999 MLD 2208); and Sharjeel Inam v. Federation of Pakistan and others 
(2017 YLR 2423). 
12 The Court considered the following cases for its holding: Javed Iqbal Mirza v. National Accountability Bureau 
(2007 PCr.LJ 1230); C.P. No. 1662/L of 2018 titled “Muhammad Rafique Virk v. Secretary Interior, Government of 
Pakistan, Islamabad etc.” decided by the Supreme Court of Pakistan vide Order dated 9.1.2020 (unreported); Hasan 
Sohail v. The State (2006 YLR 3116); Muhammad Jamal v. Federation of Pakistan and others (2012 YLR 167); and 
Mrs. Asma Alamgir v. Federation of Pakistan and others (2017 YLR 1626).

Islamabad, to attend a hearing before Mr Zafar Iqbal, Additional 
Sessions Judge, Islamabad (West), in the case titled “District Election 
Commission v. Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi.” His attorney, Mr Intazar 
Hussain Pajutha, Advocate, also filed pre-arrest applications before 
Raja Jawad Abbas, Judge, Anti-Terrorism Court, Islamabad, in FIR 
No.242/2023 and the other four cases. Since both these courts were 
located in the same Judicial Complex, the Petitioner was to appear first 
before Mr Zafar Iqbal and then in the ATC Court. Incidentally, a huge 
crowd gathered in the Judicial Complex and created a law and order 
situation, preventing the Petitioner from getting out of his car and 
reaching the courtroom until late evening. Mr Zafar Iqbal directed his 
staff to get his signatures while he was in the vehicle to confirm his 
attendance, after which he had to turn back. The national media 
covered all these events live. The 19th of March was a Sunday. On 
20.3.2023, the Petitioner’s counsel was required to appear before a 
learned Bench of this Court in W.P. No.16120/2023 wherein the 
Petitioner challenged the Government’s order to withdraw his security 
personnel. According to him, that petition was extremely important 
because there had been an assassination attempt on him a few weeks 
back. On 21.3.2023, the Petitioner filed Crl. Misc. Nos.18916/2023 and 
18919/2023 in this Court and appeared before two different Division 
Benches to get protective bail in two more cases registered against him 
in Islamabad Capital Territory in the meanwhile. On 22.3.2023, he 
could not travel because the Government refused to provide him with 
security despite a threat alert. The 23rd of March was a national 
holiday. On 24.3.2023 (today), the Petitioner filed the present petition. 
He has explained that due to security risks, he wishes to directly 
approach the Islamabad High Court for pre-arrest bail in light of the 
judgment reported as Sh. Zahoor Ahmad v. The State (PLD 1974 
Lahore 256). He could have gone today, but because it is a Friday, the 
Divisional Bench of the Islamabad High Court, which has jurisdiction 
over the matter, is not available. 
26. 
 
The learned Law Officers have not denied that there are 
currently about 100 FIRs against the Petitioner, a number which is 
growing by the day. This Court had granted him protective bail for 

Crl. Misc. No.19997/B/2023 
 
11 
 
 
seven days vide order dated 17.3.2023 in FIR No.242/2023 (and four 
other cases). We have noticed that two of these days were closed 
holidays, and the Petitioner has adequately explained his activities for 
the remaining days. More importantly, Mr Intazar Hussain Panjutha, 
Advocate, and the Petitioner have filed affidavits inter alia stating that 
they have submitted an application for pre-arrest bail in the Anti-
Terrorism Court, Islamabad, in the above-mentioned case which has 
not been taken up. 
27. 
 
In view of the above, overruling the objection relating to 
maintainability, we accepted this petition vide short order dated 
24.3.2023 and extended the Petitioner’s protective bail till 27.3.2023.
