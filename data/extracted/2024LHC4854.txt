JUDGMENT 
 
 
Date of Hearing: 
18.09.2024 
Petitioner by: 
Malik Khurram Shehzad and Arshad Mahmood, 
Advocates.  
Respondent by: 
Mr. Tariq Mehmood Khan Advocate. 
 
JAWAD HASSAN, J. Through this revision petition, the 
Petitioner/Defendant (the “Petitioner”) has impugned the judgments and 
decrees dated 25.07.2023 and 31.05.2023 passed by learned Courts below, 
whereby the suit for declaration filed by the Respondent/Plaintiff (the 
“Respondent”) was decreed.  
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that the Respondent filed a suit for 
declaration alongwith recovery of possession of shop bearing No.B-VI/99 
(detail of which is mentioned in the plaint) against the Petitioner, which was 
contested by him by filing written statement. Learned trial Court framed 
issues, recorded evidence of the Parties and ultimately decreed the suit vide 
judgment and decree dated 31.05.2023. Feeling aggrieved thereof, the 
Petitioner filed an appeal, which was dismissed vide judgment and decree 
dated 25.07.2023. Hence, this Petition.

3. 
Malik Khurram Shehzad, learned counsel for the Petitioner has 
submitted that the learned trial Court while decreeing the suit did not 
properly decide issue No.4, which reads as follows: 
4. 
Whether the suit of the Plaintiff is liable to be 
 
dismissed under Order VII Rule 11 CPC? 
 
He further submits that the Petitioner/Defendant at preliminary stage 
objected to the maintainability of the suit being barred by law, limitation and 
jurisdiction; even issue No.4 was also framed but these facts have not been 
considered by the learned trial court. Added that it is well settled law that the 
issues are commonly framed, used or understood regarding prepositions of 
law or facts about which parties are at variance according to their pleadings, 
in determination, which further help to dispose of the cases. Learned counsel 
further argued that the learned Appellate Court also did not properly 
consider the claim of the Petitioner and the evidence produced by the Parties 
was not appreciated in its true perspective, hence, the impugned judgments 
and decrees are result of misreading and non-reading of evidence.  
4. 
Conversely, Mr. Muhammad Tariq Khan, learned counsel for the 
Respondent has controverted the stance of the Petitioner and submitted that 
all the relevant issues were framed and suit was decreed in accordance with 
law. He further submitted that the Petitioner did not raise any objection 
regarding maintainability of the suit even after framing of Issue No.4. Added 
that the learned trial court clearly mentioned in the findings of the Issue No.4 
that “this issue is neither pressed nor argued by learned counsel for the 
defendant.”

5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
6. 
Nub of the matter in this case is regarding maintainability of the suit, 
which was decreed by both the learned Courts below against the Petitioner. 
The basic argument of learned counsel for the Petitioner is that the 
Petitioner/Defendant at preliminary stage objected to the maintainability of 
the suit being barred by law, limitation and jurisdiction; even Issue No.4 was 
also framed but these facts have not been considered by the learned trial 
court. Whereas the learned trial Court while giving findings on Issue No.4 
mentioned that the same is neither pressed nor argued by learned counsel for 
the defendant. 
7. 
In order to resolve the controversy, this Court framed following moot 
points on 11.09.2023: 
(i) 
Whether the Court is bound to decide the legal issues 
being not pressed? 
(ii) 
Whether the general issues of barring the suit without 
specifying limitation can be addressed by Court? 
(iii) 
Whether the issue of maintainability under Order VII 
Rule 11 CPC can be dealt with in general way? 
 
Now all these moot points will be decided one by one in accordance with 
law. 
Moot Point No. I 
Whether the Court is bound to decide the legal issues being not 
pressed? 
 
8. 
It appears from the record and as argued by counsel for the Petitioner 
that in the written statement the Defendant/Petitioner clearly mentioned that 
the suit is not maintainable under Order VII Rule 11 CPC, whereupon Issue 

 
 
 
C.R. No.530 of 2023 
 
 
- 4 -
No.4 was framed.  So, the Issue No.4 is purely based on “Question of Law”. 
The learned trial Court without properly deciding the issue in accordance 
with law simply mentioned in the findings that the same was neither pressed 
nor argued by the Defendant. Although it was the duty of the trial court to 
first decide whether the suit is barred by law or not, but the trial court 
decreed the suit on the basis of facts. The very first reference for deciding 
this moot point is based on Order XIV Rule 2 CPC, which reads as follows: 
2. Issues of law and facts.--- Where issues both of 
law and fact arise in the same suit, and the court is 
of opinion that the case or any part thereof may be 
disposed of on the issue of law only, it shall try those 
issues first, and for that purpose may, if it thinks fit, 
postpone the settlement of the issues of fact until 
after the issues of law have been determined.  
 
The above reproduced provision of law makes it amply clear that where an 
issue of law arises, that issue must be tried first. But this provision also 
specifies a condition that by deciding the said issue of law, the case or any 
part thereof may be disposed of. This conditional principle of application has 
been elaborated through numerous judgments of the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan wherein, it has been held that the provision of Order XIV Rule 2 
CPC is mandatory though before trying the issue of law as a preliminary 
issue, the court has to be convinced that by doing so, fate of whole case can 
be decided. Issues of law which go to the root of the whole case and capable 
to be decided without evidence, the court should decide that issue first. It has 
further been held that if issues are not framed but allegations are made in the 
plaint and they are rebutted in the written statement, it is open to the court to 

 
 
 
C.R. No.530 of 2023 
 
 
- 5 -
allow the parties to lead evidence on such point and to give decision on it 
without framing any issue. Reliance in this regard is placed on the judgments 
reported as The Province of East Pakistan versus Hassan Askary (PLD 1971 
S.C 82) and Messrs Zarkhaiz Agro Engineering and Services (Pvt.) LTD. 
Versus Messrs Sargodha Farms Aids (Pvt.) LTD. (2005 YLR 200). The 
interpretation of the provision of Order XIV Rule 2 CPC has put a clear 
condition, thereby leaving it to the discretion of the trial court to frame and 
decide the legal issue first or together with the issues pertaining to factual 
controversy. It has further been settled that it is open to the court to allow 
parties to lead evidence on legal issues without having it formally framed or 
whether pressed or not by the parties. 
Moot Point No. II 
Whether the general issues of barring the suit without specifying 
limitation can be addressed by Court? 
 
9. 
Before divulging into this moot point, it is appropriate to reproduce 
the relevant provision in verbatim 
11. Rejection of plaint.—The plaint shall be 
rejected in the following cases: 
 
(a) …. 
 
(b)…. 
 
(c)…. 
 
(d) Where the suit appears from the statement 
in the plaint to be barred by any law. 
 
The fourth ground for rejection of plaint is ‘barred by law’. The ‘law’ means 
written law or statute law and is used in generic sense. Law means – a 
formal pronouncement of the will of a competent law giver. Law includes- 
constitution, statutes, judicial principles, rules, by-laws etc., which squarely 

 
 
 
C.R. No.530 of 2023 
 
 
- 6 -
falls within the ambit of clause (d) of Rule 11, Order VII CPC. Limitation is 
also of the ground which may bar filing of suit after lapse of the provided 
time. There is no express direction of law to frame a specific issue in respect 
of limitation, provided an issue in respect of Order VII Rule 11 is framed 
since it not only covers barring of the suit by any law under clause (d) rather 
it covers clauses (a),(b) and (c) Order VII Rule 11as well. 
Moot Point No. III 
Whether the issue of maintainability under Order VII Rule 11 CPC 
can be dealt with in general way? 
 
10. 
There is no cavil to the proposition that the question of maintainability 
is a mixed question of law and fact. Reliance is placed on the judgments 
reported as Muhammad Chuttal versus Ata Muhammad through L.Rs (2007 
SCMR 373 SC) and Fancy Foundation versus Commissioner of Income 
Tax, Karachi (2017 PTD 1687 SC). The question of maintainability can 
therefore only be decided after inviting evidence of parties to the suit. So far 
as the question that the issue of maintainability under Order VII Rule 11 
CPC can be dealt with in general way, the answer of which has already been 
evaluated in the moot point No.1 and 2 i.e. “it is open to the court to allow 
parties to lead evidence on legal issues without having it formally framed or 
whether pressed or not by the parties’ and ‘there is no express direction of 
law to frame a specific issue in respect of limitation, provided an issue in 
respect of Order VII Rule 11 is framed since it not only covers barring of the 
suit by any law under clause (d) rather it covers clauses (a),(b) and (c) Order 
VII Rule 11 as well.”

11. 
Coming back to the instant revision petition, it is observed that the 
Petitioner agitated in the written statement that the suit of Respondent/ 
Plaintiff is liable to be dismissed being barred by law. The learned trial 
Court, therefore, framed Issue No.4 in this respect in order to enable the 
parties, particularly petitioner to put forth the available evidence. The 
questions of limitation as well as of the maintainability were covered in 
Issue No.4. Obviously, these important factors could not be gone into by the 
lower forums summarily without framing of an issue and allowing parties to 
produce evidence thereon. But the learned trial Court while deciding the 
Issue No.4 simply said that “this issue is neither pressed nor argued by 
learned counsel for the defendant.” Admittedly, the Petitioner/Defendant did 
not produce any evidence on this issue. However, as the Issue was based on 
a question of law, the Trial Court was duty bound to examine and decide it 
in light of the law and the judgments of the superior Courts. Instead, the 
Trial Court committed a legal error by deciding this significant issue in a 
few words, which is impermissible in the eyes of the law. 
12. 
Resultantly, instant revision petition is allowed, the impugned 
judgments and decrees are set aside; and the matter is remanded to the 
learned trial Court to decide the lis afresh in accordance with law after 
affording opportunity being heard to both the parties.
