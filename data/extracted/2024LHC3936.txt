petitioner. 
  
 
 
  
          This judgment decides a civil revision 
wherein judgment and decree dated 14.9.2021 
and 28.6.2024  of the Courts below, dismissing 
the petitioner’s suit for specific performance of 
agreement of sale and also the appeal there 
against, have been challenged. 
 
  
2. 
Precise facts are that a suit for specific 
performance of agreement of sale was instituted 
by the petitioner alleging that on 20.6.2009 the 
respondent agreed to sell the suit land for a total 
consideration of Rs.8,00,000/- and received 
Rs.3,25,000/- as earnest money while the 
remaining 
consideration 
of 
sale 
 
i.e. 
Rs.4,75,000/- were payable till 19.10.2010 
which she alleged to have paid on 29.9.2010 
and that the possession was given in pursuance 
of sale agreement and that the respondent 
despite request did not perform his part nor 
executed the sale deed. Petitioner, therefore, 
sought indulgence of the court for enforcement 
of sale agreement.  

              C.R. No.55854 of 2024 
 
 
      -2- 
 
 
 
  
3. 
Respondent in his written statement 
contested the suit and denied the existence or 
execution of sale agreement or any payment of 
earnest money or remaining payment as alleged 
by the petitioner.  In respect of possession it 
was maintained that the same was under a lease 
arrangement and not under any sale agreement. 
4. 
Issues were framed and evidence was 
recorded whereafter the learned Civil Judge, on 
in-depth scrutiny of evidence, concluded that 
the petitioner had failed to prove the existence 
of any bargain of sale or execution of any 
agreement or payment of any consideration and 
that agreement could not be proved in terms of 
Articles 17 and 79 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 
1984 and that the petitioner was not entitled to 
any relief. The reasoning prevailed upon by the 
court of first instance also found favour with 
the learned Addl. District Judge who after 
reappraising the entire evidence did not find 
any justification for interference and, in result, 
the appeal was also dismissed. 
 
  
4. 
Heard. 
 
  
5. 
On due consideration of the submissions 
made in the light of evidence on the file, it is 
observed that the petitioner could not make out 
any case for interference in the concurrent 
findings of fact recorded by the courts below 
and that the findings of the courts below are 

              C.R. No.55854 of 2024 
 
 
      -3- 
 
 
based on correct analysis and appreciation of 
evidence on file. Perusal of the documents 
shows that in the plaint case set up was that on 
20.6.2009 
the 
respondent 
executed 
an 
agreement of sale in favour of the petitioner in 
respect of the suit land, received Rs.3,25,000/- 
as earnest money and the balance consideration 
of Rs.4,75,000/- was payable on 19.10.2010. It 
is also the stance of the petitioner that the 
remaining consideration was paid on 29.9.2010 
and that both the payments were not confirmed 
by any separate acknowledgement or receipt 
but was reflected on the back of the stamp 
paper on which the agreement was allegedly 
drafted. Respondent had denied the existence of 
sale agreement and also the execution of 
document and the alleged claim of payment and 
it was his defence that neither any agreement 
was made nor payment was received. As 
required by law petitioner was expected to 
prove the existence of sale bargain  between the 
parties and also the execution of the agreement 
of sale by following the procedure legally 
provided under Article 79 of Qanun-e-Shahadat 
Order, 1984, as in terms of law the agreement 
could be proved by production of two 
marginal/attesting witnesses of the document. 
Petitioner only produced Abdur Rehman as an 
attesting witness and did not produce any other 

              C.R. No.55854 of 2024 
 
 
      -4- 
 
 
attesting witness although there were four 
witnesses of the document. There was no 
explanation for non-production of other three 
witnesses to the document. The statement of 
Abdur Rehman P.W.3 the attesting witness 
produced in evidence was disbelieved by the 
courts below and rightly so for the reason that 
in his cross-examination he admitted that he 
used to act as an attesting witness by getting 
money and that no payment in respect of 
agreement was made in his presence. As 
regards the other reliance of the petitioner on 
the statement of deed writer Muhammad Riaz 
P.W.2 the witness admitted that he did not 
produce the register of deed-writing to 
corroborate his statement and to confirm that he 
had acted as deed-writer. In any case his 
statement was inadmissible not being an 
attesting witness of the document nor having 
affixed his signature as attesting witness. It is a 
settled rule that testimony of the scribe could 
not be equated with that of an attesting witness 
as both of them had signed the document in 
different capacities and with a different state of 
mind and that scribe did not meet the 
requirement of Article 79 of Qanun-e-Shahadat 
Order, 1984. Reference may be made to the rule 
in Farid Baksh v. Jind Wadda and others (2015 
SCMR 1044) and Hafiz Tassaduq Hussain v. 

              C.R. No.55854 of 2024 
 
 
      -5- 
 
 
Muhammad Din through legal heirs and others 
(PLD 2011 SC 241). The petitioner was unable 
to prove the existence and execution of 
document and payment of consideration, the 
findings recorded by the courts below on the 
basis of evidence on record being correctly 
recorded and do not call for interference.  
 
  
6. 
As to the contention that the request for 
summoning of finger-print expert in witness-
box qua his report was incorrectly declined and 
that in the circumstances the court had power 
under Order XVI, Rule 14, C.P.C. to do the 
needful which was not exercised, the argument 
advanced is legally untenable. It is a matter of 
record that the petitioner did not move any 
application before the trial court for summoning 
of hand-writing expert to record his statement 
rather an application under Order XLI, Rule 27, 
C.P.C. for additional evidence was filed before 
the appellate court which was dismissed by the 
learned Addl. District Judge vide order dated 
28.6.2024 observing that the report was 
submitted on 03.4.2021 and that thereafter the 
petitioner was allowed opportunity to produce 
evidence in rebuttal on 15.4.2021, however, she 
did not move any application before the trial 
court for production of hand-writing expert and 
that the matter remained pending before the 
court till 14.9.2021 by which date no 

              C.R. No.55854 of 2024 
 
 
      -6- 
 
 
application 
was 
moved, 
therefore, 
the 
application for additional evidence at the 
appellate stage being an attempt to fill up 
lacuna in evidence could not be allowed. These 
facts noted by the learned Addl. District Judge 
could not be controverted by the learned 
counsel in his submissions. Be that as it may, it 
is settled rule that the opinion of an expert or 
the report submitted by him on its own cannot 
be made basis to disregard the direct evidence 
and that there is no need for the expert opinion 
which otherwise is nothing but confirmatory 
and explanatory to the direct evidence. 
Reference can be made to the observations 
made by the Supreme Court Of Pakistan in Mst. 
Saadat Sultan and others v. Muhammad Zahur 
Khan  and others (2006 SCMR 193) to the 
effect that the opinion of hand-writing expert is 
very weak type of evidence and is not of a 
conclusive nature and that expert evidence is 
only confirmatory or explanatory of direct or 
circumstantial evidence and that confirmatory 
evidence cannot be given preference where 
confidence inspiring and worthy of credence 
evidence is available on file. It was observed 
that even if the opinion of the expert may be 
relevant it does not amount to conclusive proof 
and can be rebutted by independent evidence 
and it is always risky to base findings of 

              C.R. No.55854 of 2024 
 
 
      -7- 
 
 
genuineness of writing on expert’s opinion. 
Reference can also be made to  Qazi Abdul Ali 
and others v. Khawaja Aftab Ahmad (2015  
SCMR 284) and Farid Bakhsh’s case supra in 
which it was observed to the effect that calling 
two  attesting witnesses for the purpose of 
proving execution of the document is the bare 
minimum and nothing short of two attesting 
witnesses, if alive and capable of giving 
evidence, can even be imagined for proving the 
execution and that construing the requirement 
of Article 79 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 
as being procedural rather than substantive and 
equating testimony of scribe with that of an 
attesting witness would not only defeat the 
letter and spirit of the said being mandatory 
must be construed and complied with as such 
and that failure to call  one witness, in the 
absence of any plausible explanation, may also 
give rise to an adverse presumption under 
Article 129(g) of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 
against the person intending to prove the 
document.  
 
  
7. 
In the instant case there were four 
witnesses to the document but only one 
attesting witness was produced who too was 
disbelieved by the courts below for well-
recorded reasons while there was no feasible 
explanation for non-production of the other 

              C.R. No.55854 of 2024 
 
 
      -8- 
 
 
marginal witnesses. The mandatory requirement 
of Articles 79 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 
1979 having not been met as such document 
could not be proved nor could the petitioner 
produce admissible or credible evidence to 
prove the existence of any bargain of sale 
between the parties or about the payment for 
consideration, therefore, the opinion of expert 
even if had been brought on record could not 
serve any purpose as a substitute for the 
mandatory requirements of law of evidence. 
The learned Addl. District Judge rightly 
declined the application for production of 
additional evidence in recorded circumstances. 
 
  
8. 
For the reasons supra, there is no 
substance in this revision petition, which is 
accordingly dismissed.
