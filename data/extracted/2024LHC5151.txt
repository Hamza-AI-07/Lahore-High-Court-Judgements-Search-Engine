WRIT PETITION NO.3455 of 2023 
JADEED FEEDS INDUSTRIES (Pvt.) LIMITED  
versus 
BOARD OF REVENUE, PUNJAB and others  
 
JUDGMENT 
Date of hearing: 
 
   24.10.2024 
Petitioner by: 
M/s Muhammad Ilyas Sheikh and 
Muhammad Kashif, Advocates. 
Respondents by: 
Mr. Khalid Ishaq, Advocate 
General, Punjab. 
 
Malik Amjad Ali, Additional 
Advocate General, Punjab. 
 
MIRZA VIQAS RAUF, J. Jadeed Feeds Industries (Pvt.) 
Limited (hereinafter referred to as “Petitioner-Company”) emerged 
as a single unit from an order dated 29th June, 2020 passed in 
pursuance to a petition under Sections 279 to 282 read with Section 
285 of the Companies Act, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as “Act, 
2017”), moved jointly by the “Petitioner-Company” alongwith its 
two sister companies, for sanctioning of Scheme of Merger and 
rearrangement 
between 
them. 
The 
grouse 
of 
the 
“Petitioner-Company” now stems from letter dated 13th April, 2023, 
whereby Chief Inspector of Stamps, Board of Revenue, Punjab 
(respondent No.1) directed all the Deputy Commissioners in the 
Punjab not to transfer the assets of the companies without payment 
of stamp duty/mutation fee etc; at the time of mutation or registration 
of merger of companies. 

WRIT PETITION NO.3455 OF 2023.  
-2- 
2.  
To comprehend the matter in controversy on better terms, it 
would be apposite to first have a resume of facts. The 
“Petitioner-Company”, alongwith two other companies namely 
Jadeed Farms (Pvt.) Limited and Jadeed GP Farms (Pvt.) Limited, 
was initially incorporated in different times under the erstwhile 
Companies Ordinance, 1984 (hereinafter referred to as “Ordinance, 
1984”) with the Securities Exchange Commission of Pakistan 
(hereinafter referred to as “S.E.C.P.”). All the three companies 
proposed Scheme of Arrangement in terms of Sections 279 to 282 
and 285 of the “Act, 2017”. By virtue of said Scheme of 
Arrangement, the entire undertaking comprising of all the assets, 
liabilities and obligations of latter two companies shall, as of the 
effective date, stand merged with, transferred to, vested in, and be 
assumed by the  “Petitioner-Company”. The Scheme of Arrangement 
was duly approved by the Board of Directors of all the three 
companies and ultimately shareholders/members of all the three 
companies unanimously approved the Scheme of Arrangement in 
their Extra-Ordinary General Meeting (hereinafter referred to as 
“E.O.G.M.”) held on 17th December, 2019. This followed a joint 
merger application before this court bearing No.C.O.No.01/2020 
which was allowed vide order dated 29th June, 2020. Feeling 
aggrieved from sub-para ‘n’ of the Scheme of Management, all the 
three companies filed R.A.No.01/2020, which was allowed vide 
order dated 02nd February, 2021 with a modification in original order. 
The grievance of the “Petitioner-Company” is that though in 
pursuance to said order it approached “S.E.C.P.”, Islamabad, who 
de-incorporated aforementioned two companies and issued afresh 
incorporation 
certificate 
containing 
the 
enhanced 
paid-up 
capital/shareholding including all the assets/properties, liabilities and 
obligations in favour of the “Petitioner-Company” but when it 
approached the revenue officers of different Districts for 
incorporation of name of “Petitioner-Company” in the revenue 
record, some of them though acceded but others refused to entertain 
the request on the ground that respondent No.1 issued letter dated 

WRIT PETITION NO.3455 OF 2023.  
-3- 
13.04.2023, restraining them not to transfer the assets of the 
companies without payment of stamp duty/mutation fee etc; at the 
time of mutation or registration of merger. 
3.  
This petition was admitted for regular hearing vide order dated 
18th October, 2023, however later on a notice was issued to the 
learned Attorney General for Pakistan as well as Advocate General, 
Punjab in terms of order XXVIIA of the Code of Civil Procedure (V 
of 1908) vide order dated 25th March, 2024, which reads as under:- 
“5.  
Apparently, there is a clear disparity in the relevant 
provisions of Companies Act 2017 and Stamp Act 1899. 
Furthermore, both the provisions require interpretation. In 
view thereof, learned Law Officer is directed to establish 
contact with the concerned quarter and after obtaining 
instructions in view of the question framed, assist the court. A 
notice in terms of Order XXVIIA of CPC be also issued to the 
learned Attorney General for Pakistan as well as learned 
Advocate General, Punjab, who shall assist the Court with 
regard to the matter in issue.” 
In response to notice, learned Advocate General, Punjab is in 
attendance today but the learned Attorney General for Pakistan is not 
available on account of his pre-occupation before Supreme Court of 
Pakistan, There is, however, a consensus amongst all in attendance 
that in view of proposition involved in this petition, it can be 
proceeded and decided without learned Attorney General for 
Pakistan. In this backdrop, I have heard learned counsel for the 
“Petitioner-Company” as well as learned Advocate General, Punjab. 
4.  
Mr. Muhammad Ilyas Sheikh, Advocate, learned counsel for 
the “Petitioner-Company” submitted that in terms of Scheme of 
Management sanctioned by this Court, only name of the 
“Petitioner-Company” is to be substituted in place of other two 
companies, which does not involve any transaction of sale requiring 
registration. Learned counsel added that the revenue officers 
concerned have only to give effect to the order of this Court whereby 
merger was approved. Emphasized that no stamp duty is leviable 
upon the “Petitioner-Company” in the circumstances and the 
impugned circular/letter is illegal and unlawful. While making 

WRIT PETITION NO.3455 OF 2023.  
-4- 
reference to Sub-Section (5) of Section 282 of the “Act, 2017”, 
learned counsel contended that the provisions of Stamp Act, 1899  
cannot be given effect in preference thereof. Learned counsel to this 
effect has also made reference to Article 143 of the Constitution of 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. Reliance has been placed on 
TOTAL PARCO PAKISTAN LTD. AND TOTAL OIL PAKISTAN 
(PVT.) LTD: In the matter of Judicial Companies Miscellaneous No.29 of 
2015, decided on 28th September, 2022 (2023 CLD 241) and DIVISIONAL 
SUPERINTENDENT, QUETTA POSTAL DIVISION and others 
versus MUHAMMAD IBRAHIM and others (2022 SCMR 292). 
5.  
Contrary to the submission of learned counsel for the 
“Petitioner-Company”, Mr. Khalid Ishaq, learned Advocate General, 
Punjab submitted that Section 12 of the “Act, 2017” specially deals 
with 
the 
change 
of 
name 
of 
the 
company 
whereas 
“Petitioner-Company” has emerged as a separate entity with the 
merger of three independent companies. Learned Advocate General, 
Punjab contended that levy of stamp duty is a provincial subject by 
all means and in terms of Article 27-A of the First Schedule to the 
Stamp Act, 1899, the “Petitioner-Company” is liable to pay stamp 
duty. Learned Law Officer has also pointed out certain distinctive 
features in the relevant laws of the province of Sindh and Punjab. It 
is argued with vehemence by the learned Advocate General, Punjab 
that judgment in FATIMA SUGAR MILLS LIMITED through 
Company Secretary and others: In the matter of C.O.No.10 of 2012, 
decided on 16th March, 2015 (PLD 2015 Lahore 632) clinches the issue. 
Learned Law Officer submitted that the scope of Article 143 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 has been 
misconstrued by the learned counsel for the “Petitioner-Company”.  
6.  
Heard. Record perused. 
7.  
It is an admitted position on the record that the 
“Petitioner-Company” has emerged on the scene as a sole entity by 
the merger of three independent companies. The term “merger” is 

WRIT PETITION NO.3455 OF 2023.  
-5- 
nowhere defined either in the “Act, 2017” or the Stamp Act, 1899 
(hereinafter referred to as “Act,1899”). The literal meaning of 
“merger” is, however, given in various law dictionaries in the 
following manner:- 
The Black’s Law Dictionary describes the meaning of “Merger” as 
under:- 
“merger. (18c) 1. The act or an instance of combining or uniting. 2. 
Contracts. The substitution of a superior form of contract for an inferior 
form, as when a written contract supersedes all oral agreements and 
prior understandings. See INTEGRATION (2). 
“Where two parties have made a simple contract for any 
purpose, and afterwards have entered into an identical 
engagement by deed, the simple contract is  merged  in the 
deed and becomes extinct. This extinction of a lesser in a 
higher security, like the extinction of a lesser in a greater 
interest in lands, is called merger.” William R. Anson, 
Principles of Law of Contract 85 (Arthur L. Corbin ed., 3d Am. 
Ed.1919).” 
Oxford, Advanced Learner’s Dictionary portrays the meaning of 
“Merger” as under:- 
“merger. the act of joining two or more organizations or businesses 
into one: a merger between the two banks – our proposed merger 
with the university.” 
Cambridge Dictionary articulates the meaning of “Merger” as 
under:- 
“merger. an occasion when two or more companies join together: 
She’s an attorney who advises companies about mergers and 
takeovers. The merger of these two companies would create the 
world’s biggest accounting firm.” 
Whereas, Webster’s Dictionary explains the meaning as under:- 
“merger. a statutory combination of two or more corporations by the 
transfer of the properties to one surviving corporation. 2. any 
combination of two or more business enterprises into a single 
enterprise. 3. An act or instance of merging.” 
The term “merger” is thus analogous and akin to amalgamation and 
absorption. 
8.  
Adverting to the core issue as to whether in case of merger of 
two or more companies into one, any stamp duty can be 
levied/claimed for incorporation of mutation in the revenue record in 

WRIT PETITION NO.3455 OF 2023.  
-6- 
favour of such company. Before embarking upon the moot point, it 
would be advantageous to first have a recourse to the relevant law on 
the subject. As already observed the “Petitioner-Company” came 
into existence as a sole entity in terms of Scheme of Arrangement, 
sanctioned and approved by way of order dated 29th June, 2020 
passed in C.O.No.01/2020. For the ease of reference, same is 
reproduced below:- 
“8.  None of the stakeholders, creditors, shareholders of  
petitioner No.1, petitioner No.2 and petitioner No.3 and other 
interested parties have come forward and raised any 
objection to the Scheme of Merger. This petition is, thus, 
allowed and the Scheme of Merger is hereby sanctioned 
which shall form part of this order as Schedule 'A'. The 
Scheme shall take effect in accordance with section 282(3) 
of the Act. In consequence thereof, it is further ordered in 
terms of section 282 of the Companies Act, 2017 as follows:

petitioners No.2 and 3 shall stand rearranged 
and resultantly merged into petitioner No.1. With 
effect from 1.7.2019, the petitioner No.1 shall be

1.7.2019.

-8- 
enforced by or against the petitioner No.1

o)  
This Court order shall be published in the official 
gazette of Pakistan and the publication report 
shall be submitted in this court within fortnight.” 
       (Underlining supplied for emphasis) 
9.  
Feeling offended from clause ‘n’, the “Petitioner-Company” 
filed R.A.No.01/2020, which was allowed vide order dated 
02.02.2021 by modifying the order under review to the following 
effect:- 
“2. The applicants merely seek the review of the above 
portion of the order dated 29.06.2020. We have heard 

WRIT PETITION NO.3455 OF 2023.  
-9- 
the learned counsel for the applicants and agree that 
the order passed by learned Single Judge to the extent 
set out above does not take into account the 
subsequent events by which the judgment referred to 
by the learned Single Judge has no application. 
Moreover, it would indeed bind the office if a reference 
was made to the judgment of the learned Single Judge 
which was passed by interpreting the provisions of 
section 284 of the repealed Companies Ordinance, 
1984 and the present Companies Act, 2017 is 
materially different from the provisions which were 
sought to be interpreted in Fatima Sugar Mills Ltd. 
case. Therefore, it would have been appropriate for the 
learned Single Judge to merely mention that the stamp 
duty shall only be deposited if found due under the law. 
We therefore accept this application by reviewing the 
order passed by the learned Single Judge to the extent 
of the extract reproduced above. (Clause n) of the order 
under review shall be read as follows:- 
The petitioner No.1 shall deposit the stamp duty if it is 
required by law.” 
(Underlining supplied for emphasis) 
10.  
The “Petitioner-Company” then approached the revenue 
officers concerned where the immoveable assets of the companies 
were located to incorporate the name of the “Petitioner-Company” 
in the revenue record and to sanction the mutations. It would not be 
out of context to mention here that in some of the Districts, mutations 
were accordingly sanctioned in favour of the “Petitioner-Company” 
but in the meanwhile, with the circulation of impugned letter, rest of 
the revenue officers refused to sanction the mutations without 
payment 
of 
requisite 
stamp 
duty, 
which 
prompted 
the 
“Petitioner-Company” to file this constitutional petition. 
11.  
In order to consolidate and amend the law relating to stamps, 
“Act, 1899” was promulgated on 27th January, 1899. For the purpose 
of capturing the matter in controversy effectively, it would be 
advantageous to first have a glimpse of relevant provisions embodied 
in “Act, 1899”. Sub-Section (6) of Section 2 defines “chargeable” in 
the following words:- 

WRIT PETITION NO.3455 OF 2023.  
-10- 
“2.  
Definitions.-In this Act, unless there is 
something repugnant in the subject or context- 
……………….. 
………………. 
……………….. 
(6)  
“chargeable” means, as applied to an 
instrument executed or first executed after the 
commencement of this Act, chargeable under this Act, 
and, as applied to any other instruments chargeable 
under the law in force in [Pakistan] when such 
instrument was executed or, where several persons 
executed the instrument at different times, first 
executed:” 
The words “executed” and “execution” find their meaning in 
Sub-Section (12) of Section 2, which reads as under:- 
“(12) 
“executed” and “execution”, used with 
reference to instruments, mean “signed” and 
“signature” : 
Whereas word “instrument” is defined in Sub-Section (14) of Section 
2, in the following way:- 
“(14) 
“instrument” includes every document by 
which any right or liability is, or purports to be, created, 
transferred, limited, extended, 
extinguished 
or 
recorded [and includes any instrument executed in 
electronic form]:” 
From the bare perusal of the above definition of “instrument”, it 
becomes manifestly clear that it includes every document by which 
any right or liability is or purports to be created, transferred, limited, 
extended, extinguished or recorded and also includes any instrument 
executed in electronic form.  
12.  
Chapter II of the “Act, 1899” deals with stamp duties and 
Section 3 signifies “instruments chargeable with duty”, which is 
reproduced below for ready reference and convenience:- 
“3. Instruments chargeable with duty.– Subject to the 
provisions of this Act and the exemptions contained in 
Schedule I, the following instruments shall be 
chargeable with duty of the amount indicated in that 

WRIT PETITION NO.3455 OF 2023.  
-11- 
schedule as the proper duty therefor respectively, that 
is to say–  
(a)  
every instrument mentioned in that Schedule 
which, not having been previously executed 
by any person, is executed in [Pakistan] on or 
after the first day of July, 1899;  
(b)  
every bill of exchange [payable otherwise than 
on demand]  [*] or promissory note drawn or 
made out of  [Pakistan] on or after that day 
and accepted or paid, or presented for 
acceptance or payment, or endorsed, 
transferred or otherwise negotiated, in 
[Pakistan]; and  
(c)  
every instrument (other than a bill of 
exchange, [*] or promissory note) mentioned 
in that Schedule, which, not having been 
previously executed by any person, is 
executed out of [Pakistan] on or after that day, 
relates to any property situate, or to any 
matter or thing done or to be done, in 
[Pakistan] and is received in [Pakistan]:  
Provided that no duty shall be chargeable in respect of–  
(1)  
any instrument executed by, or on behalf of, 
or in favour of, [the Government] in cases 
where, but for this exemption, [the 
Government] would be liable to pay the duty 
chargeable in respect of such instrument;  
(2)  
any instrument for the sale, transfer or other 
disposition, either absolutely or by way of 
mortgage or otherwise, of any ship or 
vessel, or any part, interest, share or 
property of or in any ship or vessel 
registered under the Merchant Shipping Act, 
1894, or under Act XIX of 1838, or the Indian 
Registration of Ships Act, 1841, as 
amended by subsequent Acts.”  
(Underlining supplied for emphasis) 
Thus, in terms of Section 3, every “instrument” becomes 
“chargeable” with stamp duty of the amount indicated in Schedule I, 
unless exempted. Article 27-A of First Schedule of the “Act, 1899” 
was previously not the part of the Schedule but it was inserted 
through the Punjab Finance Act, 2008, which brought the decree, 

WRIT PETITION NO.3455 OF 2023.  
-12- 
rule of the court or an order of the court based on mutual consent of 
the parties in cases involving transfer of an immovable property 
including sale, exchange, gift or mortgage, declaring or conferring a 
right in, or title to, an immoveable property, within ambit of an 
instrument chargeable to stamp duty.  
13.  
The question as to whether transfer of an immovable property 
in pursuance to merger/amalgamation of the companies becomes 
chargeable to stamp duty came under discussion in Fatima Sugar 
Case (supra) and this Court after having threadbare discussion held 
as under:- 
31.       In view of the aforesaid discussion, it is 
declared that 
(a)        the order passed by the Court under section  
284 of the Companies Ordinance is founded on 
the consent of the shareholders of two or more 
companies and that the role of this Court while 
sanctioning the compromise or arrangement is 
restricted to oversee that the compromise or 
arrangement arrived at is lawful and is not 
prejudicial to the interest of its members. Once 
the Court is satisfied with these prerequisites, 
the scheme is liable to be sanctioned as per the 
consent given to the scheme by the 
shareholders of the companies. 
(b)       the order passed by the Court sanctioning a 
scheme under section 284 of the Companies 
Ordinance is an instrument in terms of section 
2(14) of the Stamp Act and falls within the 
purview of Article 27-A of the First Schedule to 
the Stamp Act. 
(c)        the order passed by this Court sanctioning a 
scheme under section 284 of the Companies 
Ordinance is also a conveyance within the 
purview section 2(10) of the Stamp Act insofar 
as it does not involve transfer of immovable 
property. 
 (d)        the orders sanctioning the schemes of 
arrangement/amalgamation of the petitioner 
Companies 
in 
C.O. 
No.10/2012, 
C.O. 
No.25/2013 and C.O. No.18/2012 are liable to 
stamp duty on the terms mentioned above.” 
(Underlining supplied for emphasis) 

WRIT PETITION NO.3455 OF 2023.  
-13- 
14.  
So far as contention of learned counsel for the 
“Petitioner-Company” that by virtue of Sub-Section (5) of Section 
282 of the “Act, 2017”, no stamp duty is payable despite the 
provisions contained in the “Act, 1899”; suffice to observe that prior 
to the “Act, 2017”, there was “Ordinance, 1984” but it was repealed 
through Section 509 of the “Act, 2017”. It is however noticed that 
provisions of Section 279 of the “Act, 2017”, which deals with 
compromise with creditors and members, are identical and pari 
materia with Section 284 of the “Ordinance, 1984” so is the case of 
Section 282 of the “Act, 2017” and Section 287 of the “Ordinance, 
1984”. This, thus, leaves no cavil to hold that the order sanctioning 
the merger of the company is an “instrument” for all intent and 
purposes in the light of the “Act, 1899” and the principles laid down 
in Fatima Sugar Case (Supra) are equally applicable to the order of 
the merger passed under the “Act, 2017”. 
15.  
In order to understand the true scope and import of 
Sub-Section (5) of Section 282 of the “Act, 2017”, it would be apt to 
reproduce the same, which reads as under:- 
“282. 
Powers 
of 
Commission 
to 
facilitate 
reconstruction or amalgamation of companies.-(1) 
Where an application is made to the Commission under 
section 279 to sanction a compromise or arrangement 
and it is shown that---- 
 
 
 
  . ….. 
 
 
 
  ……. 
 
 
 
  ……. 
(5). Notwithstanding anything contained in the Stamp 
Act, 1899 (II of 1899) or any other law for the time being 
in force, no stamp duty shall be payable on transfer to 
the transferee company of the whole or any part of the 
undertaking and of the property of any transferor 
company as a result of sanctioning by the Commission, 
any compromise or arrangement under this Part: 
  Provided that this sub-section (5) shall, in respect of 
the companies having registered office within the 
jurisdiction of--- 

WRIT PETITION NO.3455 OF 2023.  
-14- 
(a) the Islamabad Capital Territory, be applicable at 
once; and  
 
(b) the Provinces, be applicable upon notification or 
legislation 
by 
the 
respective 
Provincial 
Governments.” 
(Underlining supplied for emphasis) 
From the bare perusal of above referred provision of law, more 
specifically, the proviso (b), it is manifestly clear that the benefit of 
said provision can only be extended if the Province concerned issued 
a notification or made legislation to this effect, which is not the case 
here. Needless to observe that proviso to Section 282(5) of the “Act, 
2017” is very instructive as regards its applicability with particular 
reference to the jurisdiction in which registered office of the 
company is situated under Clause (a) of the proviso with respect to 
the companies having registered offices in Islamabad Capital 
Territory, the provision of Section 282(5) has been made applicable 
at once, however, for the companies having registered offices in the 
Provinces, the applicability of provision in question is subject to the 
condition of issuance of notification regarding exemption from 
stamp duty by the provincial governments or legislation by the 
provinces to this effect. 
16.  
There is yet another important aspect which goes to the root 
of the case and for the said purpose, this Court has to revert back to 
the constitutional history of law relating to stamp duty. Initially, 
under the Government of India Act, 1935 (hereinafter referred to as 
“Act, 1935), as amended by the Indian Independence Act, 1947, the 
subject of stamp duty was part of the Concurrent Legislative 
List-List III-(Entry 13). The rates of such stamp duty with respect to 
the limitations laid down by Section 100(2) of the “Act, 1935”, 
however, were vested with both, the Federal and the Provincial 
Legislatures by way of Federal Legislative List-List-I-(Entry-57) and 
Provincial Legislative List-List-II-(Entry 51) respectively. Later on 
with the establishment of Province of West Pakistan, by virtue West 
Pakistan Act, 1955, the then provincial government of the Punjab 
amended the application of the “Act, 1899” as applicable in the 

WRIT PETITION NO.3455 OF 2023.  
-15- 
Punjab by way of the Stamp (Punjab Amendment) Act, 1954 and 
introduced Schedule 1-A to the “Act, 1899”. The Punjab Stamp Act, 
1954, thus, had the effect of repealing the Indian Stamp (West Punjab 
Amendment) Act, 1948. In the Constitution of 1956, the subject of 
stamp duty was listed as Item 73 in the Provincial List as “Stamp 
Duty”, including stamp duty on negotiable instruments and insurance 
policy. In the same manner, Item 90 of the Provincial List stated that 
the “rates of stamp duty in respect of documents other than those 
specified in the provisions of Federal List with regard to the rates of 
stamp duty”. A conjunctive reading of above had the effect of 
implying that the stamp duty, including the rates of such duty, vested 
with the province, except for only those documents under the Federal 
List on which the rates of stamp duty were specified. The Stamp 
(West Pakistan Amendment) Ordinance, 1959, however, further 
amended the scope of the “Act, 1899” and extended it to the whole 
of Province of West Pakistan, save for the territories under the 
Federation and other specified areas. Consequently, the Punjab 
Amendment Act, 1954 was repealed with the promulgation of 
Constitution of 1962 despite the centralization of legislative powers, 
the subject of stamp duty remained in the domain of provincial 
legislature. In the year 1969, Schedule-I to the “Act, 1899” was 
substituted  through Section 6 of the West Pakistan Finance 
Ordinance, 1969 in terms whereof all the provinces including 
province of the Punjab have their respective Schedule-I to the “Act, 
1899” since then. With the enactment of the Constitution of the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as “the 
Constitution”), legislative domains of the Federal and concurrent 
legislative lists were defined by Articles 141 and 142 of “the 
Constitution”. Clause (c) of Article 142 of “the Constitution” 
provided for residuary matters falling in neither the Federal nor the 
concurrent Legislative Lists and Provincial Assemblies enjoyed 
exclusive jurisdiction to legislate upon residuary matters. The subject 
of stamp duty was not listed, either in the Federal or Concurrent List, 
hence, 18th amendment to “the Constitution” whereby the Concurrent 

WRIT PETITION NO.3455 OF 2023.  
-16- 
Legislative List was omitted, has no bearing or effect on the subject 
of stamp duty and as such subject of stamp duty and the power to 
legislate with respect to the same are vested with the Provincial 
Assemblies. Since the promulgation of “the Constitution”, the 
Province of the Punjab, through various amendments introduced in 
Schedule-I, has changed/varied the said Schedule and rates of stamp 
duty. The said amendments include Stamp (Punjab Amendment) 
Act, 1973, Punjab Finance Act, 1992, Punjab Finance Act, 1996, 
Punjab Finance Act, 2008, Punjab Act VI of 2010, Punjab Finance 
Act, 2016 and Punjab Finance Act, 2018. The latest in series is The 
Stamp (Amendment) Act, 2021, which was passed by the Provincial 
Assembly of the Punjab, introducing material changes in the existing 
“Act, 1899”.  
17.  
Since all the provinces, being constitutionally competent, are 
dealing with the subject of stamp duty independently, so there are 
different Schedule(s) to the “Act, 1899”, which are enforced in the 
respective Provinces and a different Schedule-I is exclusively 
applicable to the territories/area, which are not part of any of the 
Provinces, including the Islamabad Capital Territory. It would not be 
out of context to mention here that Schedule-I, enforced by the 
Federation  is exclusively applicable to the Islamabad Capital 
Territory. There is no Federal Stamp Law in the field. These 
Provincial and Federal Schedules exist separately and mutually 
exclusive in their operation. This arrangement itself reflects the 
legislative scope and powers of the Provinces and the Parliament in 
terms of Clause (c) of Article 142 of “the Constitution” hence the 
subject of levying stamp duty falls squarely and exclusively within 
legislative competence of the Provincial Assemblies. The stamp 
duty, being a provincial subject and scheme of distribution of 
legislative powers between Federation and Provinces, as ordained in 
Article 142 of “the Constitution” in particular its Clause (d), the 
overriding effect of the provisions of Sub-Section (5) of Section 282 
of the “Act, 2017” or exemption from payment of stamp duty with 

WRIT PETITION NO.3455 OF 2023.  
-17- 
respect to transfers under the Scheme of Mergers is limited to the 
extent of Islamabad Capital Territory. Since under Article 142(d) of 
“the Constitution”, the Parliament has exclusive powers to make 
laws with respect to all matters pertaining to such areas in the 
Federation, which are not included in any province, the overriding 
effect over the requirement of stamp duty within Islamabad Capital 
Territory through Section 282(5) of the “Act, 2017” could be given 
by the Parliament as has been done through the proviso (a) to Section 
282(5). However, through proviso (b) to Section 282(5) of the “Act, 
2017”, the constitutional mandate and competence of the Provinces 
to levy stamp duty on transfers through sanctioned schemes of 
merger have been recognized. In view thereof, when the Government 
of the Punjab has neither issued any notification of exemption from 
payment of stamp duty under Section 9 of the “Act, 1899”, remitting 
the duties in question, nor the Province has made any amendment to 
the existing law, the stamp duties on transfer of immoveable 
properties within the territory of the Province of the Punjab are 
payable in order to act upon and authenticate the sanctioned schemes 
of merger/amalgamation. 
18.  
There can be no cavil to this legal proposition that in case of 
inconsistency between Federal and Provincial law, former will 
prevail but for the said purpose one has to understand the theme of 
Article 143 of “the Constitution”. For the purpose of convenience 
and reference, same is reproduce below:- 
“143. 
[Inconsistency 
between 
Federal 
and 
Provincial Law.-- If any provision of an Act of a 
Provincial Assembly is repugnant to any provision of an 
Act of Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) which Majlis-e-
Shoora (Parliament) is competent to enact, then the Act 
of Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament), whether passed 
before or after the Act of the Provincial Assembly, shall 
prevail and the Act of the Provincial Assembly shall, to 
the extent of the repugnancy, be void.]”.  
(underlining supplied for emphasis) 

WRIT PETITION NO.3455 OF 2023.  
-18- 
It clearly manifests from the bare reading of above provision that the 
principle embodied therein would apply when there occurs some 
inconsistency in the provincial statute as compared to Federal Law 
regarding which latter is competent to enact. As already observed, 
stamp duty for all intent and purpose is provincial subject. This was 
the reason that through proviso (b) of Sub-Section (5) of Section 282 
of the “Act, 2017”, the applicability of the Section 282 was made 
conditional to issuance of notification or legislation by the respective 
provincial governments. 
19.  
In the wake of above discussion, when contention of learned 
counsel for the “Petitioner-Company”, that in terms of Article 143 of 
“the Constitution” in case of any inconsistency between the Federal 
and Provincial law, former will prevail, is taken into consideration, 
no other inference can be drawn except that such contention is highly 
ill-founded and misconceived. While adverting to the contention, of 
learned counsel for the “Petitioner-Company”, rested highly on Total 
Parco Pakistan Limited Case (supra), it is observed that the First 
Schedule of the “Act, 1899” applicable in the Province of Sindh does 
not have any entry similar and akin to Article 27-A of Schedule-I, of 
the “Act, 1899”, as is enforced in the Province of the Punjab. 
Moreover, the said judgment is founded on entirely different facts 
and does not deal with stamp duty on transfer of immoveable 
property rather it  deals with some transfer fee. So far as claim of the 
“Petitioner-Company” that through Scheme of Management, a 
merger has taken place, which does not amount to transfer of any 
right or title and it is only change of name of the company in the 
relevant record; suffice to observe that Section 12 of the “Act, 2017” 
specifically deals with the issue of change of name by a company 
and the case of the “Petitioner-Company” is clearly beyond the scope 
of said provision. Needless to reiterate that through merger, assets 
and liabilities of the companies previously existing, stands 
transferred in the name of the “Petitioner-Company” and as          

WRIT PETITION NO.3455 OF 2023.  
-19- 
such, it clearly falls within the ambit of Article 27-A, Schedule-I of 
the “Act, 1899”. 
20.  
The nutshell of above noted threadbare discussion is that the 
instant petition is devoid of any merits and resultantly, it is 
dismissed, with no order as to costs.
