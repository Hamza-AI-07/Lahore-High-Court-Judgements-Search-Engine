Date of hearing: 
12.11.2025 
Petitioners by: 
Mr. Muhammad Iqbal Khan, Advocate. 
Respondent No.1 
by: 
Sheikh Sajid Mahmood, Advocate. 
MALIK WAQAR HAIDER AWAN, J:- Through this 
constitutional petition, petitioners have put to challenge the veracity of 
order dated 25.03.2025 passed by learned Additional District Judge, 
Lahore, whereby preliminary objections No. 1 to 3 raised by them in 
the written statement were dismissed and suit for defamation alongwith 
damages of Rs. 50,000,000/- on the basis of malicious prosecution 
(hereinafter called “the suit”) instituted by respondent No.1 was held 
maintainable under the Defamation Ordinance, 2002 (hereinafter called 
“the Ordinance 2002”). 
2. 
The factual matrix of the case is that respondent No.1 instituted 
the suit against petitioners and one Ghulam Muhammad (not arrayed as 
petitioner in this petition). Petitioners refuted the averments narrated in 
the plaint by way of filing written statement wherein they also raised 
preliminary objections qua maintainability of the suit. This 
constitutional petition emanates from dismissal of preliminary 
objections No.1 to 3 raised in the written statement.

3. 
There are three main grounds of attack as argued by learned 
counsel for the petitioners as follows: Firstly, as per Section 13 of the 
Ordinance 2002, only learned District Judge, Lahore has the power to 
hear the suit and learned Additional District Judge, Lahore (who is 
seized of the matter) is not competent to try the suit. Secondly, learned 
Additional District Judge, Lahore should have returned the plaint for  
re-filing the same before the learned District Judge, Sahiwal in terms 
of the Ordianance 2002 and as such learned Additional District Judge, 
Lahore wrongly assumed the jurisdiction. Thirdly, since the parties are 
residents of District Sahiwal and cause of action amongst them arose at 
District Sahiwal, therefore, the suit should have been filed at District 
Sahiwal. Learned counsel for the petitioners has placed reliance on 
judgments reported as Ghulam Hussain and another v. Malik Shahbaz 
Khan and another (1985 SCMR 1925), Liberty Papers Ltd. and others 
v. Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (PLD 2015 Supreme Court 
42), Syed Mushahid Shah and others v. Federal Investment Agency and 
others (2017 SCMR 1218), Munsif Khan Advocate v. Mst. Khursheed 
Begum and 2 others (2013 MLD 1032), Zafar Ali v. Additional District 
Judge, Pakpattan and another (2017 CLC 45), Wazir Ahmad Khan 
and 2 others v. Reayat Khan Khattak and 7 others (PLD 2019 
Peshawar 135) and Mst. Sardaran Bibi and others v. Town Committee 
Khuddian through Tehsil Nazim and another (2020 CLC 1630). 
4. 
Contrarily, learned counsel for respondent No.1, while rebutting 
the arguments of petitioners’ side regarding maintainability of the suit, 
contends that learned Additional District Judge, Lahore is competent to 
try the suit as Section 19 CPC clearly provides that it is the option of 
the plaintiff either to institute a suit within the local limits of 
jurisdiction of the Court where the wrong is done or where the 
defendant resides. Avers that respondent No.1 is a respectable person 
and belongs to a noble profession and cause of action arose to him at 
District Lahore, therefore, the suit was rightly instituted before the 

Writ Petition No. 34478/2025 
 
 
3 
learned District Judge, Lahore, which was entrusted to a learned 
Additional District Judge, Lahore.  
5. 
Heard. Record perused. 
6. 
First of all, I would like to deal with the submissions of learned 
counsel for the petitioners qua jurisdiction that whether only District 
Judge could try the suit or the same could be entrusted to Additional 
District Judge. To delve into the controversy, it would be expedient to 
reproduce Section 13 of the Ordinance 2002 hereunder:- 
 
The District Court shall have the jurisdiction to try the cases 
under this Ordinance. 
7. 
It is the assertion of learned counsel for the petitioners that only 
District Judge can try the suit and Additional District Judge has no 
jurisdiction to hear cases under the Ordinance 2002. I am afraid this 
interpretation is not in line with Section 13 of the Ordinance 2002. It is 
notable that the word “District Court” has been used and not “District 
Judge”.  It seems that learned counsel for the petitioners has confused 
the words “District Court” with “District Judge”. 
8. 
It would be imperative to mention here that at the time of 
promulgation of the Ordinance, 2002, the legislature employed the 
expression “District Judge” in Section 13. Subsequently, through the 
Defamation (Amendment) Act, 2004 (IX of 2004), the said expression 
was substituted with the words “District Court”. The erstwhile text of 
Section 13 of the Defamation Ordinance, 2002 (before amendment) is 
reproduced hereunder for reference:- 
Trial of cases. – No court inferior to that of the District Judge 
shall have jurisdiction to try cases under this Ordinance. 
9. 
In the above backdrop, it can safely be inferred that the 
legislature deliberately replaced the term “District Judge” with 
“District Court” in order to address the increasing pressure of work 

Writ Petition No. 34478/2025 
 
 
4 
upon the District Judge, who is simultaneously burdened with 
substantial administrative responsibilities. 
10. 
To deal with the point in issue, Section 6(2) of the Civil Courts 
Ordinance, 1962 (hereinafter called “Ordinance 1962”) is also 
relevant which is reproduced below for ready reference:- 
 
An Additional District Judge shall discharge such functions of a 
District Judge as the District Judge may assign to him, and in 
the discharge of those functions he shall exercise the same 
powers as the District Judge. 
11. 
Bare 
perusal 
of 
the 
afore-referred 
provisions 
clearly 
demonstrates that difference between District Judge and Additional 
District Judge is only to the extent of administrative powers. To my 
mind, when District Judge assigns certain functions to Additional 
District Judge, he exercises the same powers as of District Judge. 
12. 
When Section 13 of the Ordinance 2002 and Section 6(2) of the 
Ordinance 1962 are read together, it comes to light that Additional 
District Judge generally exercises the same powers as of District Judge 
except administrative functions. To clarify further, it can safely be said 
that no doubt District Judge is competent to try the cases instituted 
under the Ordinance 2002 but in the same way, when he assigns the 
cases to Additional District Judge, he also becomes fully competent to 
adjudicate upon the cases. In the above backdrop, when it has been 
concluded that Additional District Judge is competent to proceed with 
the suit, the question of return of plaint does not arise at all. 
13. 
Last but not the least, according to Rule 2(ii) of Part-A of 
Chapter 14 of Volume I of the Rules and Orders of the Lahore High 
Court, Lahore, an appeal from a decree or order of a District Judge or 
Additional District Judge exercising original jurisdiction lies to the 
High Court which clearly visualizes that the courts of District Judge 
and Additional District Judge are the same in terms of judicial business 
and for assailing the orders of both the courts (i.e. District Judge and 

Writ Petition No. 34478/2025 
 
 
5 
Additional District Judge), the appropriate forum is this Court. 
Moreover, Rule (3) of Part-G of Chapter 1 of Volume IV of the Rules 
and Orders of the Lahore High Court, Lahore is relevant in this regard 
which elucidates that once the functions of a District Judge have been 
assigned to an Additional Judge, the Additional Judge exercises, in the 
discharge of those functions, the same powers as the District Judge 
himself. It is only in respect of the functions actually assigned to him, 
however, that the Additional Judge enjoys these powers; and the 
functions so assigned, will, as a general rule, be purely judicial 
functions. From the above, a safe inference can be drawn that while 
performing judicial functions, there is no difference between the courts 
of District Judge and Additional District Judge. 
14. 
Now coming to the contention of learned counsel for the 
petitioners that the suit could be filed at District Sahiwal, keeping in 
view the abode of the parties and the place where the cause of action 
arose. I would like to refer to Section 19 CPC in this regard which is 
reproduced hereinbelow:- 
 
Where a suit is for compensation for wrong done to the person 
or to movable property, if the wrong was done within the local 
limits of the jurisdiction of one Court and the defendant resides, 
or carries on business, or personally works for gain, within the 
local limits of the jurisdiction of another Court, the suit may be 
instituted at the option of the plaintiff in either of the said 
Courts. 
15. 
The afore-referred provision makes it crystal clear that it is 
purely the plaintiff’s choice to institute a suit for compensation in the 
local limits of either Court, where the incident has taken place or where 
the defendant resides or carries on business. The purpose of said 
provision is to give the plaintiff flexibility to choose a convenient or 
appropriate forum and to prevent the defendant from evading liability 
simply by living or working in another jurisdiction. In terms of 
paragraph No.18 of the plaint, respondent No.1 was residing at District 

Writ Petition No. 34478/2025 
 
 
6 
Lahore and cause of action arose to him at Lahore, therefore, there was 
no impediment to institute the suit at District Lahore. 
16. 
As regards the judgments referred to by learned counsel for the 
petitioners, the same are not helpful for him being outcome of 
distinguished facts. 
17. 
Upon a careful consideration of the facts and law, it is observed 
that learned counsel for the petitioners has not been able to highlight 
any illegality, legal infirmity, perversity or jurisdictional defect in the 
impugned order, therefore, this constitutional petition fails and the 
same is dismissed.
