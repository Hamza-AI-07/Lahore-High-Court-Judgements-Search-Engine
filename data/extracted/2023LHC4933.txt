Dates of Hearing: 
12.09.2023 and 15.09.2023  
Petitioner by:

Respondent No.3 by: 
Mr. Muhammad Umer Riaz, 
Advocate.  
On Court’s call:  
Mr. Imran Khan, Assistant 
Advocate General, Punjab. 
Anwaar Hussain, J.  
Hira Masood (“the petitioner”) was 
married to respondent No.3 namely, Ayan Sabir (“the respondent”). 
She filed two suits against the respondent. One for recovery of 
dowry articles or alternate price thereof and other for past 
maintenance, dower amounting to Rs.500,000/- and gold ornaments 
weighing 25 tola or alternate price thereof. Both the suits were 
contested by the respondent and through consolidated judgment  
and decree dated 21.07.2018 passed by the Trial Court, the 
petitioner’s suit for recovery of dowry articles was partially decreed 
and she was held entitled to dowry articles or alternate price thereof 
to the tune of Rs.850,000/-. Her suit for recovery of maintenance and 
dower was also decreed and she was awarded Rs.10,000/- per month 
as maintenance for her iddat period as well as Rs.500,000/- along 
with 25 tola gold ornaments as dower. Both sides preferred appeals 
and through consolidated judgment and decree dated 13.04.2019, the 
appeal of the petitioner was dismissed while the appeal preferred  
by the respondent was partially allowed and the petitioner was  
held entitled to recover alternate price with 20% depreciation in  
case of non-availability of dowry articles and the suit of  
the petitioner to the extent of dower in terms of Rs.500,000/- and 

 
 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.35641/2019

25 tola gold ornaments was dismissed. Findings to the extent of 
maintenance were maintained. Hence, the present constitutional 
petition.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the Appellate 
Court has not appreciated the factual matrix as well as evidentiary 
resume of the case and misinterpreted Entry recorded against Column 
No.15 of the nikahnama that pertains to time of payment of dower, 
which was left blank and this fact alone indicates that the dower 
recorded in Column Nos.13 and 14 was prompt and payable on the 
demand of the petitioner. Places reliance on the dicta laid down in 
cases reported as “Haseen Ullah v. Mst. Naheed Begum and others” 
(PLD 2022 SC 686) and “Messrs MFMY Industries Ltd. and others v. 
Federation of Pakistan through Ministry of Commerce and others” 
(2015 SCMR 1550) in support of his contentions while contending 
that Entries in various Columns of the nikahnama are to be 
conjunctively read to ascertain the intention of the parties. Adds that 
giving of dowry articles was acknowledged but its alternate value has 
not been properly determined by the Courts below, more particularly, 
by the Appellate Court, as no reasons have been put forth in further 
reducing the said alternate amount by 20%.  
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent has vehemently 
opposed this petition and fully supported the impugned judgment and 
decree of the Appellate Court. Has also placed reliance on the law laid 
down in case of Haseen Ullah supra, with averments that the 
nikahnama is an agreement and, like any other contract, the contents 
of its clauses and/or Columns are to be construed and interpreted in 
accordance with true intentions of the parties. Adds that the intentions 
of the parties are clearly reflected by an oblique/cross line whereby 
the Entry against Column No.15 was crossed, which indicates that 
nothing was left to be paid in parts and the prompt dower agreed 

 
 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.35641/2019 
 
 
 
3
between the parties, in terms of Columns No.13 and 14 was given, by 
the respondent, at the time of solemnization of nikah. Further 
contends that the word ‘prompt’ means ‘immediate’ or ‘quick’ and it 
is presumed that nothing is left to be payable if the Entry/Column 
No.15 is crossed-off. He also places reliance on the law laid down in 
cases reported as “Wasif Ali and another v. Mrs. Fakhra Jabeen and 
others” [2023 CLC 1021 Lahore (Rawalpindi Bench)] and 
“Muhammad 
Qayyum 
Anjum 
v. 
Additional 
District 
Judge, 
Muzaffargarh and 2 others” [2022 MLD 416 Lahore (Multan 
Bench)] in support of his contentions. 
4.  
On Court’s call, learned Law Officer submits that crossing off 
the Entries of the Nikahnama ipso facto may not be so construed as 
the discharge of the liability of having paid the same and the 
evidentiary resume of the case including statements of the witnesses is 
to be examined to ascertain the intention of the parties. 
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
6. 
Regarding the quantum of maintenance awarded to the 
petitioner, for the iddat period, learned counsel for the petitioner could 
not point out any misreading and non-reading of evidence, hence, the 
finding to that extent does not merit interference.  
7. 
As regards dowry articles or its alternate price, the Appellate 
Court reduced the alternate price of the dowry articles awarded by the 
learned Trial Court to the tune of 20%. The operative part of the 
impugned judgement dated 13.04.2019 reads as under:  
“12. …As far as, the recovery of dowry articles is 
concerned the appellant/defendant has admitted during his 
cross examination that respondent/plaintiff bring the some 
portable dowry articles with her to his house. But 
appellant/defendant remained fail to provide detail of those 
portable articles. Furthermore, the appellant/defendant has 

 
 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.35641/2019 
 
 
 
4
produced the list of dowry articles Exh.D1 which was 
prepared 
by 
the 
mother 
of 
respondent/plaintiff. 
Respondent/plaintiff has clearly admitted during her cross 
examination that Exh.D1 was prepared by her mother and 
is in the handwriting of her mother. The perusal of the list 
produced by appellant/defendant shows that almost same 
articles are mentioned in it which are decreed by the 
learned Family Court from the list Exh.P2. The 
appellant/defendant has not negated the dowry articles, 
therefore, in these circumstances, the order of learned 
Family Court with regard to the dowry articles is upheld 
while to the extent of alternate price it is varied and 
respondent/plaintiff is held entitled to recover alternative 
price with 20% depreciation in case of non-availability of 
dowry articles.” 
The petitioner claimed dowry articles or Rs.7,315,915/- as its alternate 
value and perusal of the record reveals that the Trial Court, after 
thoroughly thrashing out the evidence adduced and recorded, awarded 
certain dowry articles or Rs. 850,000/- as the alternate value thereof 
that has been reduced by the Appellate Court without putting forth 
any cogent reasons for the said reduction. On the other hand, the 
petitioner side has also not been able to point out any misreading 
and/or non-reading of evidence on part of the Trial Court to establish 
the claim of the petitioner to  the grant of dowry articles claimed in 
the suit or Rs.7,315,915/- as their alternate value. Therefore, to this 
extent, this Court is of the opinion that the judgment of the Trial Court 
in respect of alternate value of dowry articles is well-reasoned and the 
reduction by the Appellate Court, to the extent of 20% in alternate 
value of dowry articles, is not justified.  
8. 
The nub of the matter is the contest between the parties in 
respect of the prompt dower admittedly fixed as Rs. 500,000/- and 25 
tola gold ornaments in the light of Entry against Column No.15 of the 
nikahnama between the parties, which in the instant case has been 
crossed by putting an oblique/cross line.  

 
 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.35641/2019

9. 
This Court is of the opinion that right of a wife to receive dower 
from her husband as stipulated in the nikahnama or otherwise agreed, 
as and when becomes due under the law, is an inherent ingredient of 
the very concept of the marriage in Islam. In the instant case, there is 
no dispute as to the amount and/or valuables in form of gold 
ornaments that was fixed as prompt dower in terms of Columns No.13 
and 14 of the nikahnama. It is the effect of how Column No. 15 of the 
nikahnama has been dealt with by the parties at the time of 
solemnization of their nikah as also the statement of the petitioner 
during the cross examination that persuaded the Appellate Court to 
upend the findings of the Trial Court and the claim of prompt dower 
was rejected, on account of having been paid, which requires opinion 
of this Court.  
10. 
Before answering the legal question, it is imperative to 
reproduce the relevant Columns of the nikahnama to understand their 
true object and import. Columns No.13 to 15, in the instant case, read 
as under: 
۔25
 
)وتےل الطیئ زویرات ۔ (معج ل رہم یک رمق ۔13 
)پ اچن الھک روےپ ۔ (معج ل 
 رہم یک ینتک رمق معج ل ےہ اور ینتک ریغ معج ل 
14
 ۔

15۔ 
 
Admittedly, the term prompt dower means ‘immediately’ or ‘quickly’ 
as also the payment ‘on demand’ as contemplated in para 290 of the 
principles of Muhammadan Law by D.F. Mulla that reads as under: 
“290 “Prompt” and “deferred” dower.-----(1) The 
amount of dower is usually split into two parts, one called 
“prompt,” which is payable on demand, and the other 

 
 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.35641/2019 
 
 
 
6
called “deferred” which is payable on dissolution of 
marriage by death or divorce.” 
(Emphasis provided) 
In case of Muhammad Qayyum Anjum supra, the moot point as to 
how above referred Columns of the nikahnama deal with the dower 
and its kinds, keeping in view the scope of Section 10 of the Muslim 
Family Courts Ordinance, 1961, came under discussion and this Court 
held as under: 
“8. ….Here it is relevant for the present purposes to 
traverse through the wording of columns No. 13 to 16 of 
the nikahnama. In column No. 13, the word “Raqm (رقم) 
“(amount) has been used; column No.14 also uses the 
word “Raqm (رقم) “(amount) whereas columns No. 15 
and 16 use the word “Mahr” (dower) that also reveals the 
intention of the legislature with regard to amount of 
dower, which can be incorporated and settled by the 
parties, under columns No.13 and 14 and other valuables 
as dower under columns No. 15 and 16. Entries in 
columns No.13 to 16 together become ‘dower overall’. 
Thus, entry in column No. 13 of the nikahnama is to 
contain the amount of dower, entry 14 envisages the 
break-up of such amount of dower spelled out by the 
parties by virtue of entry under column No. 13 into 
prompt and deferred whereas entry in column No. 15 
may contain anything given or paid out of the amount 
envisaged under entry 13 or in addition thereto forming 
as part of the dower overall…..entries under columns No. 
13 to 16 of the nikahnama envisage reflection and 
manifestation of the parties as to amount/Raqm (رقم) and 
other articles and/or property given or to be given by 
husband to wife as the dower overall. Therefore, anything 
other than an amount, forming part of dower overall and 
incorporated under columns No. 15 and/or 16 has also to 
contain the time and mode of payment and giving of the 
same by husband to wife. Failure to spell out the mode 
and time of dower contained in entry 15 and/or 16 
would entail the attraction and applicability of Section 
10 of the Ordinance.” 
 
 
 
 
 
   (Emphasis supplied)  

 
 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.35641/2019 
 
 
 
7
Section 10 of the Ordinance contemplates that “if no details about the 
mode of payment of dower are specified in the nikahnama or the 
marriage contract, the entire amount of the dower shall be presumed 
to be payable on demand”.  
11. 
In the instant case, Column No. 15 has been crossed off by 
putting an oblique line, which as per respondent’s case, means that 
the prompt dower was paid at the time of marriage and nothing has 
been left as deferred or ‘on demand’ whereas as per learned counsel 
for the petitioner since Entry No.15 was crossed off, it means nothing 
was paid and the same was left to the demand of the petitioner. This 
Court is of the opinion that it is only the deferred dower that becomes 
due upon certain exigencies, such as death and divorce, whereas once 
the mode of payment of some part of dower is settled by way of 
declaring it as prompt, in Column No.15, the obligation to pay prompt 
dower needs to be clearly mentioned as having been paid at the time 
of nikah or left payable on demand of the wife. Had there been a 
payment made at the time of the nikah between the parties, it could 
have been clearly written as ‘has been paid at spot’ (موقع پر ادا کیا گیا) 
or ‘paid’ (ادا شد) or by employing other similar words. 
12. 
Entry in respect of Column No.15 has been crossed off by 
putting an oblique line and the same cannot be interpreted to the 
disadvantage of the petitioner, for the reason that dower, in the 
context of Muslim marriage, is an obligation under the Holy Quran 
and Hadith. Burden to prove that said obligation has been discharged 
is on the husband. Said burden can be discharged through an overt act 
on part of the wife like execution of an affidavit having received the 
dower or producing the witness(es) in whose presence said obligation 
was discharged and not by relying on the Entry against Column 
No.15 of the nikahnama, having been crossed off. This Court is of the 
opinion that leaving Column No.15 blank or crossing it off by putting 

 
 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.35641/2019 
 
 
 
8
an oblique line (as in the instant case) does not mean that the amount 
of prompt dower agreed between the parties was paid at the time of 
nikah and not left to the demand of the wife. Therefore, in such 
eventualities, the Courts are required to carefully examine the 
evidentiary resume of a case to ascertain whether or not a 
groom/defendant has paid the prompt dower at the time of nikah or on 
demand of the wife. Having held so, it is imperative to examine the 
statement of the petitioner that persuaded the Appellate Court in 
upsetting the findings of the Trial Court in respect of the claim of the 
petitioner related to her prompt dower. The petitioner appeared as 
PW-1 and stated as under: 
’’یرست ےہ ہکExh.D2 & Exh.D1
 
 ریمے وےمیل واےل ین یک اصتوی  ر ںیہ۔ یرست
ےہ ہک ان اصتوی  ر ںیم وج زویرات ںیم ےن نہپ رےھک ںیہ وہ اجنمن   رسسال یےی ےئگ ےھت۔‘‘
 
The admission on the part of the petitioner that the gold ornaments put 
on by her on the walima function were given to her by her in-laws 
leads to an inference that she received gold ornaments after the nikah 
and before the walima ceremony. It is not the case of the petitioner 
that the gold ornaments put on by her at walima, were not weighing 
25 tolas as agreed in Column No. 13 of the Nikahnama or once given 
to the petitioner after the nikah, were taken back and/or snatched from 
her by the respondent or his family. This is more important and 
relevant, in the present case, in view of the fact that the petitioner had 
set up her case that she was not given any gold ornaments, forming 
part of her prompt dower, whereas subsequently, she admitted of 
having worn the gold ornaments given by her in-laws. This makes the 
case of the petitioner as one of the contradictory stances, which cannot 
be countenanced. Hence, this Court is of the view that to the extent of 
delivery of gold ornaments as part of the prompt dower, the Appellate 

 
 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.35641/2019 
 
 
 
9
Court has rightly relied on the statement of the petitioner and 
discarded the same. 
13. 
However, perusal of the above quoted statement of the 
petitioner depicts that the dower was not fully paid at the time of 
nikah inasmuch as by no stretch of imagination, the said statement of 
the petitioner in respect of the picture from the walima ceremony, in 
which the petitioner is wearing some gold ornaments admittedly given 
by her in-laws, goes on to prove that she received Rs.500,000/- that 
was also part of her prompt dower. Therefore, it was obligatory on 
part of the respondent to prove the payment of Rs.500,000/- by 
leading some independent evidence, which the respondent failed to 
do. Therefore, the case of the petitioner to the extent of her claim of 
Rs.500,000/- has force.  
14. 
In view of the above discussion, this Court is of the opinion that 
the petitioner is entitled to recover dower amount of Rs.500,000/- as 
recorded against Column No.14 of the nikahnama and dowry articles 
or alternate price of Rs.850,000/- as decreed by the Trial Court. The 
remaining findings of the Appellate Court regarding the maintenance 
allowance and 25 tola gold ornaments are upheld and to that extent 
this petition has no merits. The judgment and decree of the Appellate 
Court is accordingly modified. No order as to costs.  
15. 
Disposed of in the above terms.
