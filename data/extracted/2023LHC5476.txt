Mr. Qaiser Qadeer Qureshi, ASC. 
 
  
JAWAD HASSAN, J. This regular first appeal under 
Order XLI Rule 1 read with Section 96 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure (V of 1908) (hereinafter referred as “CPC”) calls in 
question the judgment and decree dated 16.10.2017, whereby the 
Civil Judge Class-I, Rawalpindi proceeded to partially decree the 
suit instituted by the Appellant whilst dismissing same to the extent 
of prayer of possession of suit property.  
2. 
The facts out of which this appeal has arisen are stated in 
brief that the Appellant purchased two plots bearing 05-marlas in 
Premier Awami Villas in response to offer made by the Respondent 
on 06.04.2006, in furtherance whereto, an amount of Rs.49,900/- as 
down payment alongwith membership fee of Rs.9000/- was paid by 
the Appellant. The total cost of each plot was fixed as Rs.4,99,999/-, 
which was payable in ten quarterly installments of Rs.44,910/-. 
After balloting, the Appellant was allotted two plots bearing 
Nos.AWR-02977 and AWR-02984 and he was directed to deposit 
installments as per schedule and last payment was made on 
15.10.2008. Despite delivery of possession of aforesaid plots, the 

R.F.A.No.08 of 2018 
 
2 
Defendants carried out two successive balloting on 09.01.2010 and 
30.06.2011 and allotted Villa No.463 location AV-III, Size  
05-Marlas Premier Awami Street No.26 against Registration 
No.AWR-02984 and Villa No.607b, Sector III, Second Floor, Street 
No.29 with 795 Sq.feet covered area against Registration No. 
AWR-02977. Due to violation of terms and conditions and demand 
of Rs.1,50,000/- against each plot, the Appellant filed suit for 
possession, permanent injunction and recovery of Rs.524,017,300/-. 
The said suit was partially decreed vide judgment dated 07.09.2015. 
This judgment and decree was challenged by the parties through 
separate appeals bearing Nos.158 of 2015 and 136 of 2015, which 
were decided through single judgment dated 23.02.2016 and case 
was remanded with direction to trial Court to frame appropriate 
issues and to decide it, in accordance with law. Feeling dissatisfied, 
the Appellant challenged aforesaid remand order through Civil 
Petition No.1621 of 2016 before the Supreme Court of Pakistan, 
however; it was disposed of with direction to the trial Court to 
decide the case on merits without being influenced from tentative 
observation made in the aforementioned remand order, pursuant to 
which the impugned judgment and decree was passed. Hence this 
appeal.  
3. 
Learned counsel for the Appellant, when confronted, on what 
grounds the Appellant has challenged the impugned judgment and 
decree which otherwise has been passed keeping in view all aspects 
of the matter, in response whereto, he stated that he does not press 
this appeal to the extent of possession of subject property and 
alternate plot, however, he presses hard with regard to claim of 
special damages. 
4. 
Learned counsel for the Appellant inter alia contends that the 
trial Court has not taken into consideration documents produced 
before it as Ex.P33 to Ex.P38; that the Appellant explained the 
causes of special damages due to breach of terms and conditions of 

R.F.A.No.08 of 2018 
 
3 
agreement (Ex-P2) but the trial Court has decided this issue in a 
slipshod manner.  
5. 
Contrary, learned counsel for the Respondents has argued 
that the learned trial Court after analyzing the evidence available on 
file has comprehensively dealt with the issue and passed an eminent 
judgment which does not call for interference by this Bench.  
6. 
We have heard the arguments and perused the record.  
7. 
Pursuant to directions passed in R.F.A.No.158 of 2015 dated 
23.02.2016, the trial Court captured the disputed area of facts by 
framing the following issues:- 
1. 
Whether the plaintiff is entitled to get a decree 
for possession regarding house measuring 5-
marlas Awami Premier Villa No.463, Location 
AV-III, allotted to plaintiff through balloting on

and house measuring 5-marlas Awami Premier 
Villa, allotted through balloting on 30.06.2008 
vide registration No.AWR-02977? OPP 
2. 
Whether the plaintiff is also entitled to get a 
decree for recovery of amount Rs.524,017,330/? 
OPP. 
3. 
Whether the plaintiff is entitled to get a decree 
for 
permanent 
and 
mandatory 
injunction

locus standi to file the instant suit and his suit is 
liable to be rejected u/o 7 rule 11 C.P.C.? OPD 
5. 
Whether suit of the plaintiff is false, frivolous 
and vexatious and has not come to the court with 
clean hands? OPD 
6. 
Whether plaintiff is estopped by his words and 
conduct? OPD 
7. 
Whether pre-fabricated project was revised at 
the request of member as pre-fabricated villas 
were not good as the concrete houses? OPD 
8. 
Whether suit of the plaintiff is not maintainable 
in its present form? OPD

R.F.A.No.08 of 2018

After recording evidence of the parties, the trial Court granted 
relief to the following effect:  
“In the light of my findings on each issue 
above, the suit of the plaintiff for possession 
of Premier Awami Villas is not maintainable 
in its present form, therefore, to that extent 
suit of the plaintiff is dismissed. However, as 
per offer of the defendants plaintiff is at 
liberty to take the possession of Villas being 
offered by the defendants in Phase-VIII of 
Bahria Town by paying additional charges 
Rs.300,000/- or in alternative is entitled to 
recover Rs.1,116,000/- alongwith profit 
according to Defense Saving Certificate 
from 16.10.2008 till the payment of above 
said amount alongwith simple nominal 
damages Rs.400,000/- with profit according 
to Defense Saving Certificate from date of 
decision upto date of payment”.  
 
8. 
Before proceeding further, it would be advantageous to 
mention the details of damages allegedly suffered by the Appellant 
which were provided in the plaint to the following effect: 
 
Total amount of money paid to the defendants 
Rs.1,116,000/- 
Loss of Profit on the above money @ Rs.14% per 
annum) 
Rs.540,330/- 
Cost of loss of opportunity due to above investment  
Rs.1,116,000/- 
Compensation for the Loss of Mense Profit due to 
failure to deliver the possession of the villas 
Rs.1,245,000/- 
Compensation for torture and agony faced by the 
plaintiff due to non-performance of the defendants.  
 
Rs.20,000,000/- 
Damages for failure to perform by the defendants as 
per their representations and projections 
Rs.500,000,000/- 
Total 
Rs.524,017,330/- 
 
9. 
With regard to award of damages, the guidance is sought 
from the judgment of Supreme Court of Pakistan cited in “ABDUL 
MAJEED KHAN versus TAWSEEN ABDUL HALEEM and others” 
(2012 PLC (C.S.) 574) wherein the general damages and special 
damages have been elaborated in details by holding as under: 
 

R.F.A.No.08 of 2018 
 
5 
“Term 'general damages' refers to special character, 
condition or circumstances which accrue from 
immediate, direct and approximate result of wrong 
complained of. Similarly, term 'special damages' is 
defined as actual but not necessary result of injury 
complained of. Special damages follow as a natural 
and approximate consequence in a particular case by 
reason of special circumstances or condition. In an 
action for personal injuries, general damages are 
governed by the rule of thumb whereas special 
damages are required to be specifically pleaded and 
proved”.  
 
10. 
We have asked the learned counsel for the Appellant to show 
from the evidence that the Appellant has suffered any loss of profit 
@Rs.14% per annum, compensation for the loss of mense profit 
due to failure to deliver possession of the villas, and likewise to 
further show from the record as to compensation for torture and 
agony and damages for failure of the Respondents, learned counsel 
was unable demonstrate from the record that the Appellant has 
adduced any evidence to prove special damages allegedly sustained 
on account of above mentioned losses. Reliance is also placed on 
“Malik GUL MUHAMMAD AWAN versus FEDERATION OF 
PAKISTAN through Secretary M/o Finance and others” (2013 
SCMR 507) wherein it has been held that “person claiming special 
had to prove each item of loss with reference to the evidence 
brought on record”. It is also held in case “Mrs. Alia Tareen, 
Managing Director, Pakistan General Hospital, Quetta and others 
Vs. 
Amanullah 
Khan, 
Advocate 
and 
3 
others”  
(PLD 2005 Supreme Court 99) that “special damages must be 
specially pleaded and proved.” While awarding special damages, it 
is to be kept in mind that the person claiming special damages has 
to prove each item of loss with reference to the evidence brought on 
record. This may also include out-of-pocket expenses and loss of 
earnings incurred down to the date of trial, and is generally capable 
of substantially exact calculation as held by the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in “MUNAWAR AHMED, CHIEF EDITOR DAILY SAMA 

R.F.A.No.08 of 2018 
 
6 
and another versus MUHAMMAD ASHRAF and others” (PLD 
2021 Supreme Court 564). Perusal of evidence produced by the 
appellant reveals that the Appellant has not brought on record any 
tangible material entitling him for special damages as claimed for. 
A ground has been agitated by learned counsel for the Appellant 
that documents Ex.P33 to Ex.P38 have not been considered. 
Needless to add that these documents relate to acknowledgment 
slips for different tax years which have no nexus to the grant of 
special damages. The Appellant’s claim does not qualify aspired 
destination even if same is tested and evaluated on touchstone of 
parameters envisaged in Section 73 of the Contract Act, 1872. In 
said regard, it shall be appropriate for ready reference to first 
reproduce said provision of law as follow: 
“Section 73:  
When a contract has been broken, the party who 
suffers by such breach is entitled for receive, from the 
party who has broken the contract compensation for 
any loss or damage caused to him there by, which 
naturally arose in the usual course of things from 
such breach, or which the parties knew, when they 
made the contract to be likely to result from the 
breach of it.  
Such compensation is not to be given for any remote 
and indirect loss or damage sustained by reason of 
the breach.” 
 
11. 
Appellant’s claim so agitated in the case in hand was bound 
to be followed by strong and legally reckoned evidence for proof 
thereof and mere breach of the agreement on part of the Respondent 
in said regard was not sufficient enough to straightaway grant 
special damages in favour of the Appellant. In this connection, the 
Appellant was obliged to establish, substantiate and prove all heads 
of his claim separately and distinctly. Reliance in said regard may 
be placed upon observation in case “MALIK MUHAMMAD RIAZ 
versus MUHAMMAD HANIF and others” (2022 SCMR 1572) 
whereby it has been held that:  

R.F.A.No.08 of 2018 
 
7 
“6.…  The survey of Prayer Clauses as incorporated 
in the plaint for the relief of damages, it is somewhat 
mix of special and general damages claim but no 
convincing evidence was adduced to the effect of 
sustaining any serious financial losses even no 
evidence was adduced with regard to the alleged 
irreparable losses or mental agony.”  
 
12. 
According to substance of aforementioned Section 73 of the 
Contract Act, 1872, remote and indirect loss or damage sustained 
by reason of agitated breach cannot be granted. Reliance in said 
regard maybe placed upon pronouncement in case “SANDOZ 
LIMITED and another versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN and 
others” (1995 SCMR 1431) relevant part wherein reads as follows: 
 “27. A perusal of the above-quoted section 73 shows 
that it deals with the consequences of breach of a 
contract and the basis on which compensation for any 
loss or damage is to be assessed by providing that 
when a contract has been broken, the party who 
suffers by such breach is entitled to receive from the 
party who has broken the contract, compensation for 
any loss or damage caused to him thereby, which 
naturally arose in the usual course of things from 
such, breach, or which the parties knew, when they 
made the contract, to be likely to result from the 
breach 
of 
it. 
It 
further 
provides 
that 
such 
compensation was not to be given for any remote and 
indirect loss or damage sustained by reason of such 
breach. …”.   
 
13. 
Furthermore, it has been held in “MIRZA MUHAMMAD 
MOIN BAIG Versus Mst. AMTUL RAUF and others” (2007 MLD 
1978) that “There is no yardstick or definite principle for assessing 
damages. Party claiming damages due to breach of contract must 
establish contract and extent of damages. Section 73 of the Contract 
Act, pertains to the compensation for loss or damage caused by 
breach of contract, which cannot be given for any remote and 
indirect loss or damage sustained by reason of the breach.” It has 
also been held in case “M/s. SAGARIA BROTHERS versus Messrs 
AZIM MARKAZ and 2 others” (PLD 1994 Karachi 149) that “it is a 

R.F.A.No.08 of 2018 
 
8 
settled principle that in order to be entitled to compensation for 
breach of contract, the party claiming compensation must establish 
specifically the loss suffered by it, a mere general assertion cannot 
be made basis for awarding compensation.” However, in the case in 
hand, the Appellant has not embraced success on any count in 
proving the actual damages he suffered and all heads of the damages 
he claimed for to enable court for assessment and grant thereof.   
14. 
We are thus of the considered view that the trial Court in the 
circumstances rightly decreed the suit of Appellant partly. The 
Appellant has failed to persuade us to exercise appellate 
jurisdiction. As a result, this Appeal, being devoid of any merit, is 
hereby dismissed with no orders as to cost.
