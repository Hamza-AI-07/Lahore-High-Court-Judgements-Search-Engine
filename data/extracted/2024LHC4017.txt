Date of hearing:     04.09.2024. 
Applicant by: 
M/s. Sh. Anwar-ul-Haq and Sh. Ikram Elahi, 
Advocates. 
Respondent by: 
Ch. Imran-ul-Haq, Advocate.  
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.- Through 
instant Reference Application under Section 133 (1) of the Income 
Tax Ordinance, 2001 (“the Ordinance of 2001”), following 
questions of law, urged to have arisen out of impugned order dated 
14.02.2018, passed by learned Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue 
of Pakistan, (Division Bench-I) at Islamabad (“Appellate 
Tribunal”), have been pressed and argued for our opinion:- 
1. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, 
when it is admitted or determined that income has been 
concealed by suppressing the sales can the evaded tax be 
allowed to be kept as a gift by the taxpayer on the ground 
that wrong provision of law has been mentioned i.e. Section 
111(1)(d)(i)? 
2. Whether both the Appellate Tribunal was justified to vacate 
the order passed u/s 122(5) without appreciating that 
amount credited in the bank account of the taxpayer, which 
remained unexplained, and attracted the addition under 
Section 111(1)(b) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, 
cannot be deleted merely for mentioning of Section 111(1)(d) 
in the order?  
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that during desk audit, on account 
of certain discrepancies, found between the bank statement and 
statement of final taxation for the period in question, a show cause 
notice was issued to the respondent-taxpayer to explain the nature

and source of credit entries based on suppression of sales / tax 
evasion. Although respondent filed reply to the show cause notice, 
yet the same was found unsatisfactory which further led to 
amendment of the assessment and subsequent addition of 
Rs.228,092,419/- under Section 111(1)(d) of the Ordinance of 2001 
and total income was assessed at Rs.233,077,419/- involving tax 
demand of Rs.57,023,104/-. Feeling disgruntled, respondent-
taxpayer filed appeal before Commissioner Inland Revenue 
(Appeals-III) which was disposed of vide order dated 17.11.2016 
by observing that Section 111(1)(d) as well as general rate of tax on 
the income of taxpayer without altering his status under the 
minimum tax regime u/s 113A declared u/s 115(4) of the Ordinance 
ibid, was wrongly applied by the assessing officer, thus, modified 
the assessment order with further direction to allow the credit of tax 
if any already paid by the taxpayer. Being dissatisfied, both the 
department as well as respondent-taxpayer preferred their 
respective appeals before learned Appellate Tribunal, which were 
disposed of vide consolidated order dated 14.02.2018 thereby 
vacating orders of both the authorities below and deleting the 
addition made by the assessing officer u/s 111(1)(d) of the 
Ordinance of 2001. Hence, instant Reference Application.  
3. 
Learned Legal Advisor for applicant-department submits that 
despite the fact that income has been concealed by suppressing the 
sales, the appeal of respondent-taxpayer was allowed by learned 
Appellate Tribunal without any lawful justification, on the ground 
that the provision of law i.e. Section 111(1)(d)(i) of the Ordinance 
of 2001 was not attracted. He further contends that in fact show 
cause notice should have been issued under Section 111(1)(b) of the 
Ordinance of 2001, however, Section 111(1)(d) was erroneously 
quoted. In the end, he submits that impugned order is unsustainable 
in the eye of law. In support, he has referred to Collector of Sales 
Tax and Central Excise, Lahore v. Zamindara Paper and Board 
Mills and others (2007 PTD 1804).

4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for respondent-taxpayer defends 
the impugned order by contending that the additions made under 
Section 111(1)(d) were rightly deleted and said provision of law 
operates prospectively not retrospectively as rightly held by learned 
Appellate Tribunal in the impugned order.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused. 
6. 
Before dilating upon the controversy involved in this 
Reference Application, it would be expedient to reproduce the 
provisions of Sections 111(1)(b) & 111(1)(d), which are as under:- 
“111. Unexplained income or assets. — (1) Where —  
(a)  
..... 
(b)  
a person has made any investment or is the owner of any 
money or valuable article; 
(c)  
..... 
(d)  
any person has concealed income or furnished inaccurate 
particulars of income including —  
(i)  
the suppression of any production, sales or any amount 
chargeable to tax; or  
  
.....” 
 
7. 
Learned Legal Advisor for applicant-department, at the very 
outset, was confronted with the findings of learned Appellate 
Tribunal that retrospective effect cannot be given to the provision 
of clause (d) of Section 111(1) supra. The relevant part of Appellate 
Tribunal’s findings is reproduced hereunder:- 
“6. 
..... We have considered all the aspects of this case 
in the light of record and arguments of both the rival parties. 
We feel no hesitation to hold that section 111(1)(d) was 
inserted through Finance Act 2011. In the light of ratio 
already settled by the superior courts referred in the above 
paras as relied upon by learned AR this amendment in law 
was prospectively applicable. Its retrospective application on 
the assessment for tax year 2010 was absolutely illegal. ..... 
We have found that the learned CIR (A) was convinced in 
his mind that in this case provisions of section 111(1)(d) 
were wrongly applied because these provisions were 
inserted through Finance Act 2011 and were applicable 
prospectively from tax year 2012. .....”

Upon Court’s query as to whether aforesaid findings of 
Appellate Tribunal were assailed through instant Reference 
Application by proposing any question on retrospective application 
of Section 111(1)(d) of the Ordinance of 2001, learned Legal 
Advisor could not show from available record that any such 
question was proposed. When certain observations on some issue / 
question are not challenged in a Reference Application before the 
High Court, it clearly signifies that these observations have attained 
finality. In this case, question regarding retrospective application of 
Section 111(1)(d) ibid is not available for adjudication. The finality 
of such decisions establishes vested rights, thereby reinforcing the 
need for diligence in addressing legal matters within the prescribed 
timelines. Reference is made to Commissioner Inland Revenue v. 
Messrs Pak Arab Pipe Line Company Ltd. (2014 PTD 982), Messrs 
Azad Kashmir Logging and SAW Mills Corporation (AKLASC), 
Muzaffarabad v. Commissioner Income Tax, Inland Revenue, 
Muzaffarabad (2017 PTD 1058) and The Commissioner of Income 
Tax v. Messrs Fauji Foundation (2021 PTD 1951).  
8. 
Section 111(1)(d) was inserted through the Finance Act, 2011 
with prospective effect and came into force w.e.f. 01.07.2011. 
Whereas the matter pertains to tax year 2010, thus, no 
retrospectivity can be given to it. As a basic principle of 
interpretation of statutes, tax statutes operative prospectively unless 
clearly indicated by the legislature, therefore, retrospectivity cannot 
be presumed. Reliance in this regard is placed upon Commissioner 
Inland Revenue, Lahore v. Messrs Millat Tractors Limited, Lahore 
and others (2024 SCMR 700). It is well settled that a statute or any 
amendment thereto ordinarily operates prospectively unless, by 
express enactment or necessary intendment, retrospective operation 
has been given to it. Reliance is placed upon Sardar Sher Bahadar 
Khan and others v. Election Commission of Pakistan through 
Secretary, Election Commission, Islamabad and others (PLD 2018 
Supreme Court 97).

9. 
The argument of learned Legal Advisor for applicant-
department that in fact show cause notice should have been issued 
under Section 111(1)(b) of the Ordinance of 2001 instead of 
Section 111(1)(d), is misconceived as the dispute in hand i.e. 
suppression of sales comes within the ambit of Section 111(1)(d). 
Clause (d) of Section 111(1) reproduced supra confers a power on 
the Commissioner to bring to tax unearthed income i.e. income 
which was concealed by either suppression of sales or production or 
any amount chargeable to tax. The words “chargeable to tax” apply 
to the entirety of sub-clause (i) i.e. also to the suppressed 
production and / or sales. If “any amount” can be brought within the 
scope of sub-clause (i) only if, and to the extent, that it is 
“chargeable to tax” (i.e. constitutes “income” properly so called), 
then production and sales must be given the same treatment. Thus, 
it is only production or sales chargeable to tax that can be brought 
within the ambit of clause (d) to Section 111(1) of the Ordinance. 
The taxpayer is exposed to the same tax liability in respect of the 
income that has escaped assessment, or been suppressed i.e. 
taxpayer is liable to tax on the “net” amount, or “income” properly 
so called. This issue has been settled by the Hon’ble Supreme Court 
in the judgment reported as Commissioner Inland Revenue, Zone-II, 
Regional Tax Office, (RTO) Lahore v. Mian Liaqat Ali Proprietor, 
Liaqat Hospital, House No.6, Street No.6, Lal Pul, Panj Pir Road, 
Mughalpura, Lahore (2023 SCMR 534).  
10. 
In view of the above, our answer to the purposed question is 
in affirmative i.e. against applicant-department and in favour of 
respondent-taxpayer. 
 
This  Reference Application is decided against applicant-
department.
