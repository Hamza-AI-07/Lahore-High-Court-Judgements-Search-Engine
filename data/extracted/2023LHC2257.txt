MIRZA VIQAS RAUF, J. The petitioner herein is a private 
limited company registered under the Companies Act, 2017 dealing 
with the business of publishing newspapers most commonly known as 
“Daily Jang”, “Weekly Akhbar-e-Jehan” etc. As per claim of the 
petitioner-company, it is a trans-provincial establishment having its 
place of businesses at Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Quetta, Multan 
and London and as such matter relating to formation of trade unions 
and federations or trade unions, determining the collective bargaining 
agents, regulation of relations between employers and workers, the 
avoidance and settlement of any differences or disputes arising

between them or matters connected therewith and ancillary thereto are 
to be dealt with under the Industrial Relations Act, 2012 (hereinafter 
referred to as “Act, 2012”). Furthermore the disputes between the 
company and its employees are to be adjudicated by the National 
Industrial Relations Commission (hereinafter referred to as 
“N.I.R.C.”) under the Act ibid. The grievance of the petitioner-
company canvassed herein is that respondent No.3 is a trade union in 
the establishment of the petitioner-company which has been got 
registered by its members under the Punjab Industrial Relations Act, 
2010 (hereinafter referred to as “Act, 2010”) with Registrar Trade 
Unions, Rawalpindi (respondent No.2) by submitting false documents 
and information. On attaining the knowledge about registration of 
respondent No.3 with respondent No.2, the petitioner moved an 
application to respondent No.2 for revocation of certificate of 
registration of respondent No.3, however, it was rejected summarily 
by way of order dated 22nd August, 2022, which is now impugned in 
the instant petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973. 
2. 
This petition was admitted for regular hearing vide order dated 
23rd November, 2022 in response to which the respondents submitted 
their respective written statements. The stance of respondents No.1 & 
2 in their written statement is that a local trade union namely “Daily 
Jang & Press Workers Union, Rawalpindi” is already registered with 
them since 05th March, 1983 and since then they have not received 
any objections from the petitioner to this effect. The petition has 
mainly been resisted by respondent No.3 on the ground that the trade 
union was registered after fulfillment of all the codal formalities. It is 
also one of the grounds of resistance that there is already a trade union 
which exists in the petitioner establishment and registered by the 
Registrar of trade union with the name “Daily Jang and Press Workers 
Union Rawalpindi” which has never been challenged by the 
petitioner-company and as such it is now precluded to challenge the 
registration of respondent No.3.

3. 
Arguments have been addressed by learned counsel for the 
petitioner and respondent No.3 as well as learned Law Officer at 
considerable length. In the light of respective submissions, I have 
perused the record. 
4. 
The status of the petitioner-company being trans-provincial 
establishment is not disputed seriously by any of the respondents. In 
this backdrop the moot point which requires determination of this 
Court is as to “what is the forum and the law for registration 
of trade union in case of trans-provincial establishment?”.  
5. 
“Act, 2012” was promulgated on 14th March, 2012 to 
consolidate and rationalize the law in Islamabad Capital Territory and 
at trans-provincial level, relating to formation of trade unions and 
federations or trade unions, determining the collective bargaining 
agents, regulation of relations between employers and workers, the 
avoidance and settlement of any differences or disputes arising 
between them or matters connected therewith and ancillary thereto. It 
was made applicable to all persons employed in any establishment or 
industry, in the Islamabad Capital Territory or carrying on business in 
more than one province. The term “establishment” is defined in 
Section 2(x) of the “Act, 2012” in the following manner :- 
“(x)     “establishment” means any office, firm, factory, society, 
undertaking, company, shop or enterprise, which employs 
workmen directly or through a contractor for the purpose of 
carrying on any business or industry and includes all its 
departments and branches in the Islamabad Capital Territory or 
falling in more than one province, whether situated in the same 
place or in different places and except in Section 62 includes a 
collective bargaining unit, if any, constituted by any 
establishment or group of establishments;” 
Whereas sub-section (xxxii) of Section 2 of the “Act, 2012” provides 
the definition of “trans-provincial” in the following manner :- 
“(xxxii) “trans-provincial” means any establishment, group of 
establishments, industry, having its branches in more than one 
province;” 

Writ Petition No.3383 of 2022 
 
-4- 
 
There thus remains no cavil that the petitioner-company is a trans-
provincial establishment, so in this eventuality “Act, 2012” would 
come into play.  
6. 
Chapter-II of the Act ibid provides the manner of registration of 
trade unions. Section 2(vi) of the “Act, 2012” provides the definition 
of “Commission” in the following manner :- 
“(vi)    “Commission” 
means 
the 
Industrial 
Relations 
Commission constituted under Section 53;” 
Section 53 of the “Act, 2012” deals with the composition of 
“N.I.R.C.” whereas Section 54 of the Act ibid lays down its numerous 
functions amongst which the registration of trade union is also one of 
the pivotal functions of the same. For ready reference and 
convenience, Section 54 of the “Act, 2012” is reproduced below :- 
“54.  Functions of the Commission.—The following shall be 
the functions of the Commission, namely— 
(a)  to adjudicate and determine an industrial dispute in the 
Islamabad Capital Territory and trans-provincial to which a 
trade union or a federation of such trade unions is a party and 
which is not confined to matters of purely local nature and 
any other industrial dispute which is, in the opinion of the 
Government, of national importance and is referred to it by 
that Government; 
(b)  to register trade unions and industry-wise trade unions of an 
establishment or group of establishments in the Islamabad 
Capital Territory and trans-provincial, and federations of 
such trade unions; 
; 
; 
; 
From sub clause (b) it clearly manifests that in case of trans-provincial 
establishment the trade union shall be registered by the “N.I.R.C.”. 
Contrary to the above, respondent No.3 was registered by respondent 
No.2 while invoking Section 9 of the “Act, 2010” whose applicability 
is only restricted to the Province of Punjab and as such it cannot be 
stretched in case of trans-provincial establishment.  
7. 
Learned counsel for respondent No.3 as well as learned Law 
Officer when confronted as to how the registration of respondent No.3 
was made by respondent No.2 while invoking the latter Act, they have 

Writ Petition No.3383 of 2022 
 
-5- 
 
failed to give any plausible answer. In order to properly comprehend 
the proposition involved herein guidance can be sought from 
PAKISTAN TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANY LTD. versus MEMBER NIRC 
and others (2014 SCMR 535). Relevant extract from the same is 
reproduced below :- 
“12. 
After combined reading of the scheme of new labour 
laws, both Provincial and Federal, it may be concluded without 
any fear of rebuttal that two parallel forums have been created, 
one on a provincial basis whereas latter is federal level forum, 
called NIRC. Both these forums are having jurisdiction to deal 
with industrial disputes and unfair labour practice and other 
allied matters either attributable to the employer or the 
workers/workmen, however, the Federal Law has drawn a clear 
demarcation line of jurisdiction of these two different forums, i.e. 
Labour Courts in the Provinces and the other NIRC at the 
Federal Level. It is not the nature of dispute, particularly, unfair 
labour practice, which confers jurisdiction on one or the other 
forum but it is the status of the employer or the group of 
employers, which would determine the jurisdiction of the 
Provincial Labour Court and that of the NIRC. To be more clear 
on the point we have no hesitation to hold that once it is 
established though any means that the employer or group of 
employers has an establishment, group of establishments, 
industry, having its branches in more than one Provinces, then 
the jurisdiction of the NIRC would be exclusive in nature and of 
overriding and super imposing effects over the Provincial Labour 
Court for resolving industrial dispute including unfair labour 
practice, etc. related to the employer, having its establishment or 
branches or industrial units in more than one Province and re-
course has to be made by the aggrieved party to the NIRC and 
not to the Provincial Labour Court.” 
8. 
It is noticed that in the case reported as Messrs UNILEVER 
PAKISTAN FOODS LIMITED versus REGISTRAR, TRADE UNIONS and others 
(2017 PLC 102) a learned Single Bench of this Court has also pondered 
upon the scope of both the above referred statues and held as under :- 
“10. 
Both PIRA, 2010 and IRA, 2012 have received 
considerable judicial scrutiny in a fairly small amount of time 
since these enactments were promulgated. The two judgments 
that will be cited below interpreted and laid down law that have 
settled a number of issues including the ones raised in these writ 
petitions. In Pakistan Telecommunication's case, the Hon'ble 
Supreme Court had the occasion to dilate upon the two 
enactments and their scope. After reviewing the provisions of 
both PIRA, 2010 and IRA, 2012, it was held thus 
12. After combined reading of the scheme of new labour 
laws, both Provincial and Federal, it may be concluded 
without any fear of rebuttal that two parallel forums have 
been created, one on a provincial basis whereas latter is 
federal level forum, called NIRC. Both these forums are 
having jurisdiction to deal with industrial disputes and unfair 
labour practice and other allied matters either attributable to 
the employer or the workers/ workmen, however, the Federal 

Writ Petition No.3383 of 2022 
 
-6- 
 
Law has drawn a clear demarcation line of jurisdiction of 
these two different forums, i.e. Labour Courts in the 
Provinces and the other NIRC at the Federal Level. It is not 
the nature of dispute, particularly, unfair labour practice, 
which confers jurisdiction on one or the other forum but it is 
the status of the employer or the group of employers, which 
would determine the jurisdiction of the Provincial Labour 
Court and that of the NIRC. To be more clear on the point we 
have no hesitation to hold that once it is established through 
any means that the employer or group of employers has an 
establishment, group of establishments, industry, having its 
branches in more than one Provinces, then the jurisdiction of 
the NIRC would be exclusive in nature and of overriding and 
super imposing effects over the Provincial Labour Court for 
resolving industrial dispute including unfair labour practice, 
etc. related to the employers, having it establishment or 
branches or industrial units in more than one Province and re-
course has to be made by the aggrieved party to the NIRC 
and not to the Provincial Labour Court. 
13. Even otherwise under the provision of Article 143 of the 
Constitution of Pakistan, 1973, laws enacted by the 
Parliament have been given overriding and superimposing 
effects over the laws enacted by a Provincial Assembly of 
any of the Province and in case of any clash or repugnancy 
between the two, the laws enacted by the Parliament shall 
prevail. Thus, on the touchstone of the provision of Article 
143 of the Constitution, the Act of Parliament has been 
placed on the high pedestal and any Provincial Law enacted 
by the Provincial Assembly shall give way to the Federal 
Law, enacted by the Parliament, if the former is inconsistent 
or repugnant to the latter. Therefore, it is held that the 
provision of Act X of 2012 (the IRA, 2012) has overriding 
effect on all Provincial Labour Laws. Judged from this angle, 
we are of the firm view that in the present case, the learned 
Judge in Chamber of the Lahore High Court. Lahore while 
drawing the impugned judgment dated 26-11-2012 could not 
properly comprehend the intents and objects of the above 
provisions of law, rather misconstrued and misinterpreted the 
same, resulting into miscarriage of justice, the impugned 
judgment being not sustainable in the eye of law is liable to 
be set at naught. (emphasis supplied) 
11. 
The issue of the vires of IRA, 2012 was deferred in the 
afore-mentioned judgment by the Hon'ble Supreme Court but it 
soon cropped up before this Court. A learned Division Bench of 
this Court in ICA No.53 of 2013 titled PTV Employees Ittehad 
Union Punjab v. Federation of Pakistan had the opportunity to 
delve in the matter. After tracing the history of Labour laws and 
a number of judgments on the subject, the vires of IRA, 2012 
was upheld. While doing so, the determinations made by the 
learned Division Bench of this Court were as follows: 
(i) IRA, 2012 is applicable only to establishments located in 
Islamabad 
Capital 
Territory 
and 
Trans-Provincial 
Establishments and undertakings which have presence, 
factories and offices etc in more than one Province. 
(ii) The law has been promulgated to provide a mechanism 
for enforcement of a fundamental right i.e. freedom of 
association as enshrined in Article 17 of the Constitution to 
workers working in establishments operating in the 
Islamabad 
Capital 
Territory 
and 
in 
trans-provincial 
establishments and industry. 

Writ Petition No.3383 of 2022 
 
-7- 
 
(iii)It is designed to provide a uniform and unified legal 
system and mechanism for enforcement of ILO Convention 
Nos.87 and 98 throughout the country. 
(iv) The law is aimed at providing a legal framework relating 
to formation of trade unions, federation of trade unions, 
determining collective bargaining agents, regulation of 
relations between employers and workers of establishments 
in the Islamabad Capital Territory and in trans-provincial 
establishments and industry considering that such mechanism 
would not be available under provincial laws which have 
reach and applicability only within the territorial limits of 
each province. 
(v) For the aforenoted purpose, Chapter 8 of the IRA, 2012 
provides for constitution of a National Industrial Relation 
Commission (NIRC). It has the mandate to adjudicate and 
determine industrial disputes in Islamabad Capital Territory 
and relating to workmen of trans-provincial establishments, 
to register trade unions and industry wise trade unions and 
federations of such trade unions, to determine collective 
bargaining agents amongst trade unions and industry wise 
trade unions, to deal with cases of unfair labour practices etc. 
NIRC also advises the Federal Government on matters 
involving trade unions and industry wise trade unions in 
Islamabad Capital Territory and at a trans-provincial level in 
respect of education of workers in the essentials of trade 
unionism. This includes education in respect of their rights 
and obligations and to secure the provision of facilities 
required 
therefor 
and 
to 
apportion 
costs 
between 
Government, trade unions and federations of such trade 
unions and employers in such manner as may be considered 
equitable. The NIRC has exclusive jurisdiction in the 
aforesaid matters over establishments and group of 
establishments situated in Islamabad Capital Territory and 
trans-provincial establishments. (Emphasis supplied) 
12. 
The dicta laid down in the afore-mentioned judgments 
leaves no room for doubt that the formation of trade unions of 
the workers of a trans-provincial Establishment and the matters 
incidental thereto are regulated by IRA, 2012. The petitioner 
being a trans-provincial Establishment is accordingly governed 
by IRA, 2012 and the unions operating in its various factories, 
offices and departments shall have to be registered with NIRC. It 
may be stated that in view of the importance of the issue, NIRC 
also got itself represented through its law officer and filed a 
specific report in the light of order dated 22.06.2016 passed by 
this Court requiring NIRC to answer the query as to whether 
respondent No.2 being a union located in one factory of the 
petitioner can be registered with NIRC or not. NIRC in the 
additional report by relying upon the judgment Pakistan 
Telecommunication Company Limited v. Member NIRC and 
others 2014 SCMR 535 made it clear that it was the status of the 
petitioner which would determine the question of registration of 
respondent No.2 with NIRC. 
13. 
In the present case there is no dispute that respondent 
No.2 has a right to register itself as a trade union. This right of 
respondent No.2 is not even disputed by the petitioner. The case 
of the petitioner is simply that the Provincial Registrar exceeded 
his jurisdiction in registering respondent No.2 as the trade union 
under the provisions of PIRA, 2010 whereas the petitioner being 
a trans-provincial Establishment, the jurisdiction vested with 
NIRC under IRA, 2012. This stance of the petitioner is supported 

Writ Petition No.3383 of 2022 
 
-8- 
 
both by NIRC and Federal Government. 
14. 
It was also asserted that the members of respondent No.2 
were not the employees of the petitioner but were in fact the 
employees of respondents Nos.4 and 5 who were the independent 
contractors, the implication being that such members had no 
right to get themselves registered as a trade union. This 
contention has no force in view of the clearly worded definition 
of "Worker" and "Workman" contained in section 2(xxxiii) of 
IRA, 2012. Similarly, the fact that other workers unions 
operating in the factory/offices/departments of the petitioner 
were registered with the Provincial Registrar hardly provides any 
lawful justification for the grant of similar status to respondent 
No.2. 
15. 
This Court has already come to the conclusion that 
petitioner is indeed a trans-provincial Establishment based on the 
annual report 2015 brought on the record by the petitioner. 
Respondent No.2 also did not seriously object to the said status 
of the petitioner. Having established that the petitioner enjoyed 
trans-provincial status, the controversy regarding the law which 
governs the registration of the trade union of a trans-provincial 
Establishment does not pose a serious problem as it is covered by 
the ratio of the afore-mentioned two judgments according to 
which the nature of dispute does not confer jurisdiction on the 
relevant forum rather it is the status of the employer which is the 
determining factor and that NIRC is the sole authority with the 
power to register trade unions and industry-wise trade unions 
pertaining to the trans-provincial Establishments. The Provincial 
Registrar/respondent No.1 indeed misconstrued the provisions of 
Factories Act, 1934 in registering respondent No.2 whereas it 
had no authority under the law to do so. Order dated 17.08.2015 
passed by the Provincial Registrar/respondent No.1 is, therefore, 
liable to be set aside. 
16. 
In the result, this writ petition succeeds and orders dated 
13.05.2014 and 17.08.2015 are set aside being without lawful 
authority and of no legal effect.” 
Reference to this effect can also be made to P.T.V. EMPLOYEES’ 
ITTEHAD UNION, PUNJAB through Secretary versus FEDERATION OF 
PAKISTAN through Secretary Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Law and 
Parliamentary Affairs and 6 others (2018 PLC 136).  
9. 
The nutshell of above discussion is that respondent No.2 was 
not competent to register respondent No.3 as trade union and the 
registration certificate dated 02nd July, 2022 is without any lawful 
authority and coram non judice, as a sequel thereof this petition is 
allowed as prayed for, with no order as to costs.
