Respondent by: 
Mr. Tahir Mehmood, Advocate. 
 
 
Anwaar Hussain J. This Intra Court Appeal (“ICA”), in 
terms of Section 3 of the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 is directed 
against judgment dated 12.06.2024 passed by the learned Judge-in-
Chambers through which constitutional petition bearing W.P 
No.3085/2023, filed by the respondent, has been allowed and the 
decision of the Administrative Department for conducting second 
measurement of the height was declared illegal.  
2. 
By way of factual background, it has been noted that the 
respondent applied for the post of Sub-Inspector in Punjab Police 
Department through Punjab Public Service Commission (“the 
PPSC”) in terms of advertisement No.29/2020 published by the 
PPSC. As per the pre-conditions mentioned in the advertisement dated 
22.10.2020, the respondent was medically examined in the District 
Headquarters Hospital, Muzaffargarh and found physically fit for 
recruitment against the post of Sub-Inspector. Thereafter, the 
respondent appeared in the written examination and interview,

I.C.A No.148/2024 
whereafter, the PPSC issued merit list by recommending the 
respondent to be appointed as Sub-Inspector against open merit and 
his name was reflecting at Serial No.2 of the merit list. Thereafter, the 
appellant-department referred the respondent for measurement and his 
height was found as 5.6-3/4 feet on 16.02.2023, hence, his 
appointment letter was not issued. The respondent impugned the act 
of appellant-department qua measurement, through the constitutional 
petition by alleging that such act of the appellant-department is liable 
to be set aside being not warranted under the law, which was allowed 
by the learned Judge-in-Chambers.    
3. 
It is the case of the appellant-department that the learned Judge-
in-Chambers has erred in law while allowing the constitutional 
petition of the respondent, inasmuch as the requirement of height is 
one of the core conditions for appointment to the post of Sub-
Inspector and the respondent failed to meet the said condition. 
Learned Law Officer submits that passing of direction to issue 
appointment letter manifest interference in recruitment process which 
practice has been deprecated by the Constitutional Courts. 
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent supported the 
impugned judgment and while placing reliance on the order dated 
20.03.2023 passed by a learned Single Bench in W.P No.83404/2022  
titled “Huma Hameed v. Chief Secretary, Punjab and others” (at 
Principal Seat), as well as order dated 19.07.2023 passed by the 
learned Division Bench in ICA No.22155/2023 titled “Muhammad 
Masoom v. Inspector General of Punjab Police and others” (at 
Principal Seat), submits that once the respondent was medically 
examined in accordance with the advertisement, there was no room 
for subsequent/second measurement of height.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
6. 
The nub of the matter is to examine as to whether in terms of 
the applicable rules and regulations, the appellant-department was 

 
 
 
3 
I.C.A No.148/2024 
justified in conducting the second measurement of the height. Before 
rendering opinion, it is imperative to observe that the appointment of 
Sub-Inspector is admittedly governed by the Sub-Inspectors and 
Inspectors (Appointment & Conditions of Service) Rules, 2013 
(“Rules 2013”) read with Volume-II (Appointments and Enrolments) 
of the Police Rules, 1934 (“Police Rules”). Admittedly, the required 
height is 5'-7" in terms of Rule 12.15 of the Police Rules, whereas 
Rule 12.16 contemplates that every recruit is required to be medically 
examined before the enrolment. The said rule reads as under: 
“12.16 Recruits. Medical Examination of.--(1) Every 
recruit shall, before enrolment, be medically examined and 
certified physically fit for service by the Civil Surgeon. A 
certificate, in the prescribed form (10 64), signed by the 
Civil Surgeon personally, is an essential qualification for 
enrolment (vide Fundamental Rule 10).” 
 
 
Whereas in the advertisement bearing No.29/2020 dated 
22.10.2020, following conditions qua physical standard has been 
mentioned:  
 
“Candidates are required to mention Physical Standard in 
their Online Application Form as per Certificate of 
Physical Standard issued by the Medical Superintendent of 
District Headquarters Hospitals or Service Hospital, 
Lahore or Police Hospitals shall be accepted under the 
Regulations/Policy Decisions. However, Medical Fitness 
Certificate issued within three (03) months prior to the 
closing date of the Advertisement shall be acceptable 
subject to the condition that the candidate fulfills all other 
requirements of Physical Standards prescribed for the post. 
Medical Certificate issued after the closing date and 
revision in Physical Standards after the closing dates shall 
not be accepted. Tempered Medical Certificate is not 
acceptable.”      
 
7. 
The fact that a candidate is required to take medical 
examination at the time of submission of his application cannot be 
treated as conclusive determination and declaration of his medical 
fitness in terms of applicable rules (i.e., Rule 12.15) inasmuch as the 
medical certificate in terms of the advertisement is for the purpose of 

 
 
 
4 
I.C.A No.148/2024 
screening at initial stage and to avoid unwarranted progression of unfit 
candidates. It is an expedient approach inasmuch as against limited 
number of posts of Sub-Inspectors and Inspectors, thousands of 
applications are submitted, and it is not feasible as also practicable for 
the department to conduct medical examination in terms of Rule 12.16 
of the Police Rules through the Civil Surgeon. Once a person clears 
written examination, as also interview on the basis of which he is 
offered appointment subject to satisfying the mandate of Rule 12.16, 
which is precursor to the declaration of enrolment. No claim to 
recruitment could be made on the basis of initial-cum-preliminary 
medical examination. It is after the enrolment that vested rights are 
created and can be claimed by the medically fit candidate, in the 
context of mandate of Rule 12.16. Once comprehensive medical 
examination, in terms of Rule 12.16 of the Police Rules, has been 
carried out and fitness was certified accordingly, only then any 
subsequent/second 
height 
measurement, 
let 
alone 
medical 
examination cannot be carried out, which is not the case pleaded by 
the respondent before us.  
8. 
The requirement of medical examination for measurement of 
height at the time of enrolment as Sub-Inspector, after the offer of 
appointment is made, cannot be equated with the result of medical 
examination required at the time of submission of applications, in 
terms of the advertisement. We are of the view that the Police Rules 
stipulate the height requirements, as also the conduct of medical 
examination at the time of enrolment of a selected candidate and, 
therefore, the medical examination got conducted by the candidate in 
order to process his application, in terms of the advertisement, cannot 
be accorded precedence over the mandate of Rule 12.16 of the Police 
Rules. The advertisement is one of the steps and/or subsets of the 
overall scheme of appointment envisaged under the law and it belies 
logic if subset of the process is permitted to attain primacy over the 

 
 
 
5 
I.C.A No.148/2024 
entire scheme envisaged under the Police Rules itself. The 
appointment/enrolment of any candidate as Sub-Inspector was subject 
to the medical certificate issued in terms of Rule 12.16 of the Police 
Rules which aspect has not been considered in cases of Huma 
Hameed supra and Muhammad Masoom supra relied upon by learned 
counsel for the respondent. Conclusiveness of declaration of medical 
fitness before recognizing and confirming candidate’s enrolment, in 
terms of Rule 12.16, was affirmed through a reported judgment, of a 
Full Bench of this Court, dated 16.05.2024 in case bearing I.C.A 
No.37/2022 titled “Government of the Punjab etc. v. Muhammad 
Ahmad (2024 LHC 2683), in which case vision impairment was the 
disability in the context of appointment of Sub-Inspector. It has been 
held as under: 
 “In view of the aforesaid, we, for the present purposes, 
hold that appointment/enrolment was subject to the 
declaration of medical fitness in terms of Rule 12.16 and 
appendix thereto and prescribed vision standards.”     
 
9. 
In view of the above discussion, this ICA is allowed and 
impugned judgment dated 12.06.2024 passed by the learned Judge-in-
Chambers in W.P No.3085/2023 is set aside. As a natural corollary, 
the constitutional petition filed by the respondent is dismissed.
