AHMAD NADEEM ARSHAD, J. This Revision Petition 
has been directed against the judgments & decrees of Courts below 
whereby the suit of the respondent No.1 namely Ghulam Hussain 
was decreed concurrently.  
2. 
Facts in brevity are that predecessor of respondents namely 
Ghulam Hussain (plaintiff) instituted a suit for declaration and 
permanent injunction on 01.08.1995 against the petitioners 
(defendants) and sought declaration to the effect that he is owner in 
possession of the land measuring 1243 Kanals situated at Khata 
No.210/124, Mauza Khairaywala, Tehsil Chobara, District Layyah, 
according to the record of rights for the years 1957-58 and land 
measuring 1067 Kanals situated at Mauza Khairaywala, Tehsil 
Chobara, District Layyah, in the light of mutation No.2543 dated 

Civil Revision No.751-D of 2004. 
-2-
12.08.1971 sanctioned on the basis of registered will deed No.1 
dated 06.05.1968; that the said mutation and registered will deed 
have been sanctioned/executed correctly and defendants have no 
concern with the suit property; that order dated 04.09.1994 of 
Consolidation Collector, Layyah, order dated 02.10.1994 passed by 
Consolidation Officer Chobara and order dated 12.07.1995 passed 
by Consolidation Collector, are against the facts, law, without 
issuing notice, without providing opportunity of hearing, void, and 
having no effect upon his rights and as a consequential relief sought 
issuance of perpetual injunction that the defendants be restrained 
permanently from interfering in his title, possession and 
incorporation of the impugned orders in the revenue record. 
Plaintiff pleaded in his suit that the suit property originally 
belonged to Diam son of Dulla who transferred the same through 
registered will deed dated 06.05.1968 in his favour; that after his 
demise, in the light of said will, with the consent of his legal heirs 
mutation No.2543 was attested on 12.08.1971; that against said 
mutation defendant No.1 namely Kaneez moved a review petition; 
that Collector Consolidation granted permission of review vide 
order dated 04.09.1994; that in the light of said permission 
Consolidation Officer reviewed the mutation No.2543 vide order 
dated 02.10.1994; that he challenged said order by preferring an 
appeal which was dismissed vide order dated 12.07.1995; that the 
defendants are estopped from their words and conduct to challenge 
the will deed and mutation; that Consolidation Officer has no 
authority to declare that Diam (deceased) was Shia by sect and 
prayed for decree of his suit.  Petitioners/defendants resisted the 
suit through filing contesting written statement whereby they raised 
preliminary objections that plaintiff is their real brother who is 
adamant to deprive them from their inheritance right; that alleged 
will was neither got executed by Diam (deceased) nor it was acted 
upon/implemented; that alleged will was not disclosed to the 
defendants and their father; that the plaintiff is estopped from his 
words and conduct to institute the suit; that plaintiff has no cause of 

Civil Revision No.751-D of 2004. 
-3-
action; that the suit is not maintainable in its present form; that 
consolidation proceedings cannot be challenged in the Civil Court; 
that suit is barred by time; that plaintiff has efficacious remedy by 
way of appeal and without availing such remedy the suit is not 
maintainable. While replying on facts, maintained that Diam was 
owner of the suit property; that plaintiff prepared the alleged will 
by practicing fraud and succeeded to get the said will incorporated 
through mutation which was rightly reviewed by the Collector; that 
mutation No.2543 was concealed from the legal heirs of Diam and 
at the time of execution of the alleged will as well as sanction of 
mutation neither Allah Diwaya (legal heir of Diam) was present nor 
his consent was obtained. In last, they prayed for dismissal of the 
suit. Learned Trial Court, in the light of divergent pleadings of the 
parties framed necessary issues and invited them to produce their 
respective evidence. After recording evidence of the parties pro & 
contra, oral as well as documentary, decreed the suit vide judgment 
& decree dated 28.07.2000. Feeling aggrieved, petitioners preferred 
an appeal. During the pendency of said appeal, the learned 
Appellate Court framed two additional issues (1-a & 1-b) vide 
order dated 23.09.2003 and remitted the matter to the learned Trial 
Court under Order XLI Rule 25 C.P.C with the direction that after 
recording additional evidence and giving findings on said issues file 
be sent back to the Court. Learned Trial Court, after recording 
evidence of the parties, decided both the issues vide order dated 
17.01.2004 and sent the matter back to the learned Appellate Court. 
Learned Appellate Court, thereafter, dismissed the appeal vide 
judgment & decree dated 06.05.2004. Being dissatisfied, petitioners 
filed instant revision petition.  
3. 
Heard. Record perused.  
4. 
Respondent No.1 in his suit basically challenged the orders 
dated 04.09.1994, 02.10.1994 and 12.07.1995. From the record it 
appears that petitioner No.1 (Kaneez) moved an application in the 
year 1994 before the Consolidation Officer, Layyah, for review of 
the mutation No.2543 dated 12.08.1971. After receiving said 

Civil Revision No.751-D of 2004. 
-4-
application, the Consolidation Officer sought permission of review 
and forwarded the matter to the Addl. Deputy Commissioner 
Consolidation vide order dated 01.09.1994, who granted permission 
of review through order dated 04.09.1994. In the light of said 
permission, the Consolidation Officer, vide order dated 02.10.1994 
reviewed the mutation No.2543 and passed fresh order by giving 
1/3 share to the plaintiff in the light of will and rest of the 2/3 share 
was given to Allah Diwaya (father of parties) being lineal 
ascendant of Diam (deceased). Plaintiff challenged said order 
through preferring an appeal which was dismissed vide order dated 
12.07.1995. Being aggrieved, plaintiff assailed said orders by 
instituting the suit in hand.  
5. 
Now the basic point for determination is that whether 
mutation No.2543 passed on the strength of registered will deed 
could be reviewed or not by the Consolidation Officer.  
6. 
Admittedly, the suit property belonged to Diam who died 
issueless. During his lifetime, he transferred his entire property to 
plaintiff (Ghulam Hussain) through a registered will deed dated 
06.05.1968 (Exh.P.10). Diam died on 02.02.1970 as evident from 
his death certificate (Exh.D.3). He neither cancel nor challenge said 
will deed during his lifetime. At the time of his death, the only 
surviving legal heir was Allah Diwaya (father of the parties) being 
his lineal ascendant. Although, the petitioners alleged that at the 
time of demise of Diam, Mst. Fateh wife of Diam was also alive 
and she was legal heir of said Diam but the petitioners failed to 
prove said fact by producing cogent and trustworthy evidence. 
Diam was died on 02.02.1970 as evident from his death certificate 
(Exh.D.3), whereas, Mst. Fateh w/o Diam died on 22.11.1968 as is 
evident from her death certificate (Exh.P.11), therefore, the 
findings of learned Appellate Court that at the time of demise of 
Diam, his only surviving heir was Allah Diwaya, his lineal 
ascendant are correct.  
7. 
Perusal of mutation No.2543 dated 12.08.1971 (Exh.P.2) it 
appears that said mutation was sanctioned in presence of Allah 

Civil Revision No.751-D of 2004. 
-5-
Diwaya, the legal heirs of Diam in favour of plaintiff. Said Allah 
Diwaya did not raise any objection at the time of attestation of said 
mutation which was sanctioned on the strength of registered will 
deed. It also suggests that said will deed was came into the 
knowledge of said Allah Diwaya at the time of attestation of 
mutation but he neither challenged the will nor questioned said 
mutation during his lifetime. He died in the year 1979 as evident 
from his inheritance mutation No.797 dated 07.10.1980 (Exh.P.13). 
His presence at the time of mutation and silence till his death 
speaks a lot and appears to his consent over will deed.  
8. 
It is matter of record that husbands of the petitioners namely 
Muhammad Murad, Laal Khan and, Sultan along with others being 
reversionaries of Diam challenged the veracity of said registered 
will deed dated 06.05.1968 and mutation No.2543 dated 12.08.1971 
by instituting suit for declaration on 17.05.1974 against the plaintiff. 
The suit was resisted by the plaintiff and the learned Trial Court 
after contest dismissed the same vide judgment & decree dated 
03.04.1978. Said decree was not assailed any further and it attained 
finality. Copies of said proceedings are available on file as Exh.P.1.  
9. 
Although, the petitioners (defendants) were in knowledge of 
the will deed and mutation No.2543 as their husbands challenged 
said will deed and mutation, but they did not challenge said will 
deed and mutation before any competent forum at the relevant time. 
The Civil Court has the ultimate jurisdiction to see legality and 
validity of any registered or unregistered document. It is also matter 
of record that petitioners instituted a suit for declaration against 
their mother namely Mst. Dolat and plaintiff with regard to 
inheritance mutation of their father namely Allah Diwaya in the 
year 1986. Said suit was decided on the basis of compromise. In 
this regard, plaintiff as well as defendants No.2 & 3 executed 
undertakings on 27.02.1990. Said proceedings were placed on 
record as Exh.P.5. Through compromise agreement executed by 
petitioners No.2 & 3/ defendants No.2 & 3 (Glulam Fatima and 
Mureed), they undertook as under:

In the light of said undertaking, petitioners were estopped to 
challenge the veracity of mutation No.2543, sanctioned on the 
strength of will with regard to legacy of Daim s/o Dullah.  
10. 
The Consolidation Officer, Layyah, while reviewing the 
mutation No.2543 admitted the will deed as correct and awarded 
1/3 of the suit property to the plaintiff. However, reviewed the 
mutation on the ground that testator could not bequest more than 
one third of his property. The petitioners did not challenge said 
findings of the Consolidation Officer.  
11. 
In order to reach a just conclusion, it is better to understand 
the terminology of „Will’, its effect and how much property a 
testator can bequest. The Will is defined under Section 2(h) of the 
Succession Act, 1925, which reads as under: 
 
"will" means the legal declaration of the intention of a testator 
with respect to his property which he desires to be carried into 
effect after his death.” 
 
 
A will or testament or Wassiyat has been defined as “an 
instrument by which a person makes disposition of his property to 
take effect after his death and by the virtue of its nature is 
rescindable.  
 
A will is essentially a legal declaration which signifies the 
intention of the testator with regard to the distribution of his or her 
property. A will does not affect the power of the owner to transfer 
the property either inter vivos or by any other testamentary 

Civil Revision No.751-D of 2004. 
-7-
disposition. It is not binding upon the testator in any manner, 
especially before his or her death.  
 
Ameer Ali says “a will from the Mussalman point of view is 
a divine institution since its exercise is regulated by the Quran”.  
 
Tyabji says that a will means “the legal declaration of the 
intentions of a Muslim with respect to his property which he desires 
to be carried into effect after his death.”  
 
According to the Hedaya, composed by Sheikh Burhan Ud-
din Ali “a will is the endowment with the property of anything after 
death”. 
  
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in its recent judgment 
titled “ZAKIA BEGUM AND OTHERS V. NASIR-UL-ISLAM 
KHAN AND OTHERS (2022 SCMR 2130)”, defines the will as 
under: 
 
“A will can therefore be considered as a formal document 
drawn up by a natural person wherein he expresses his wish 
as to how he would want his estate to be distributed after their 
death. By virtue of the fact that wills operate after the death of 
the donor, they are considered testamentary instruments i.e. 
instruments that come into effect after the death of the 
donor/testator.” 
  
 
 
The following terms are important to note in terms of wills:  
a) Testator:-The person, who makes/creates a will.  
b) Legatee:- The person/persons, in whose favour, the will is 
created.  
c) Legacy:- The subject matter of the will. It is the property to be 
distributed among the heirs.  
d) Executor:- The testator, while executing the will, may appoint a 
person to execute the will in accordance with its contents (after 
his death). 
 
When a Muslim dies there are four duties which need to be 
performed. These are:  
 Payment of funeral expenses  
 Payment of his/her debts  
 Execution his/her will  
 Distribution of the remaining estate amongst the heirs 
according to Shariat.  

Civil Revision No.751-D of 2004. 
-8-
 
When a person dies his/her property devolves upon his/her 
heirs. A person may die with or without a will (Testament). If he or 
she dies leaving a will, the property is distributed among his/her 
heirs according to the rules of Testamentary Succession. In other 
words, the property is distributed as per the contents of the 
testament or will. On the other hand if a person dies leaving no 
testament (will), that is dies intestate, the rules of intestate 
Succession are applied for distribution of the property among heirs. 
 
Will is declared lawful in the Qur‟an, though the Qur‟an 
itself does not provide for the testamentary restriction of 1/3rd. The 
permissibility of bequest upto 1/3rd is traced to a Hadiath of the 
Prophet which has been stated by Sa‟d Ibn Abi Waqqas and the 
information was reported by Bukhari. The story behind this was 
one of the fellow associates of Prophet was very ill and there were 
chances of his death, as was very old as well, also he canceled his 
Mecca due to ill-health. He was asked by the Prophet about the 
distribution of his wealth, for which replied that he will give all his 
property in charity (not to the family), to which Prophet said he 
should give only 1/3 of his total property to any one of his choices 
so that the major portion remains within the family and they will 
not become destitute in future. The Said Hadiath reads as under: 
“The Messenger of God used to visit me at Mecca, in the year 
of the Farewell Pilgrimage on account of my illness which 
had become very serious. So I said, “My illness has become 
very severe and I have much property and there is none to 
inherit from me but a daughter, shall I then bequeath two-
thirds of my property as a charity?” He said, “No.” I said, 
“Half?”, He said “No.” Then he said: “Bequeath one-third 
and one-third is much, for if thou leavest thy heirs free from 
want, it is better than that thou leavest them in want, begging 
of other people; and thou dost not spend anything seeking 
thereby the pleasure of Allah but thou art rewarded for it even 
for that which thou puttest into the mouth of they wife” 
 
12. 
A will can be made in favour of heir as well as non-heir. In 
case of heir, the bequest is not valid unless the other heirs 
consented to the bequest after the death of the testator as defined in 
Section 117 of D.F. Mulla‟s Mohammadan Law, reads as under: 
 

Civil Revision No.751-D of 2004. 
-9-
"A bequest to an heir is not valid unless the other heirs 
consent to the bequest after the death of the testator. Any 
single heir may consent so as to bind his own share. 
Explanation - In determining whether a person is or is not an 
heir, regard is to be had, not to the time of the execution of the 
will, but to the time of the testator's death."   
 
 
The testator is also entitled to make a bequest in favour of a 
non-heir.  
13. 
The next question is how much property of a testator can be 
disposed of through bequest. Section 118 of D.F. Mulla‟s 
Mohammadan Law defines that a Mohammadan cannot dispose of 
more than third of the surplus of his estate after payment of funeral 
expenses and debts, but in excess of one third cannot be taken 
effect, unless the heirs consented thereto which is reproduced as 
follows: 
"A Mohammadan cannot by will dispose of more than a third 
of the surplus of his estate after payment of funeral expenses 
and debts. Bequests in excess of the legal third cannot take 
effect, unless the heirs consent thereto after the death of the 
testator." 
 
14. 
B.J. Verma in Section 188 of the Commentaries of 
Muhammadan Law describes that a bequest to an heir is not valid 
except to the extent to which the heirs of the testator make consent 
expressly or impliedly. Meaning thereby, there is no restriction 
upon the testator and he can bequest his entire property to his legal 
heir but said bequest will require consent from the legal heirs after 
the death of testator impliedly or expressly. Said section reads as 
under: 
"A bequest to an heir is not valid except to the extent to which 
the persons who are the heirs of the testator at the time of his 
death, expressly or impliedly consent to the bequest after his 
death." 
 
 
However, in case of non-heir, Mohammadan can dispose of 
his property, in excess of one third, if qualify the conditions as 
stated in section 190 of B.J Berma‟s Commentaries of 
Mohammadan Law, which reads as under:  
"A Mohammedan is not entitled to dispose of his property 
(which would otherwise devolve on his heirs under 

Civil Revision No.751-D of 2004. 
-10-
Mohammedan Law) by will in favour of a person who is not a 
heir, in excess of one third except in the following cases:- 
(1)  Where, subject to the provisions of any law for 
the time being in force, such excess is 
permitted by a valid custom; 
(2)  where there are no heirs of the testator; 
(3)  where the heirs existing at the time of the 
testator's death, consent to such bequest after 
his death; 
(4)  where the only heir is the husband or the wife 
and the bequest of such excess does not effect 
his or her share." 
 
 
There are two exceptions to the one third Rule: 
a) When the testator does not have any heir. In such cases, 
if the restriction of permissible one-third is applied, 
then the beneficiary is the Government who will take 
the property by doctrine of Escheat, while the primary 
purpose of applying the bequeathable permissibility to 
the extent of one-third is to protect the rights of the 
heirs, and not that of the Government. An heirless 
person can thus make a bequest of the total property.  
b) Where the heirs themselves consent to the bequest in 
excess of one-third. As the chief objective is to 
safeguard the interests of theirs, the excess bequest can 
be validated by consent.   
 
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case titled 
“MUHAMMAD TUFAIL V. ATTA SAHBBIR AND 5 OTHERS 
(PLD 1977 SUPREME COURT 220)”, with regard to Shia 
School of thought held as under: 
“……..according to Shia Law, a testator can leave a legacy to 
an heir even without the consent of the other heirs but where it 
exceeds one-third, it is not valid without the consent of all the 
other heirs who may give their consent before or after the 
death of the testator.” 
 
 
The will covering the entire property of the testator instead of 
being confined to one-third is not void-ab-initio as held by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in Muhammad Tufail‟s case (referred 
supra), wherein the Court observed as under: 
 

Civil Revision No.751-D of 2004. 
-11-
“The first question to be addressed to is as to what is the 
effect of the will covering the entire property of the testator 
instead of being confined to one-third. As observed earlier, 
this restriction on the extent of testamentary disposition 
confining it to one-third of the entire property of the testator is 
not based on any injunction of the Holy Qur'an but is traced to 
a tradition of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) to which 
no less sanctity attaches as a source of Islamic Law. Since, 
however, according to the Shia doctrine based on Verses 180 
and 181 of Sara AI-Baqara, a bequest could be made to an 
heir and even in excess of one-third subject course to the 
assent of other heirs it is clear that bequest comprising the 
entire property is not void ab initio and of course depends on 
its validity on the assent of all the heirs which is not available 
in the instant case.” 
 
 
The will made in favour of non-heir will be effective without 
the consent of other heirs as held by the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the case titled “ABDUL HAQ AND ANOTHER V. MST. 
SURRYA BEGUM AND OTHERS (2002 SCMR 1330). The facts of 
the case are that one Samad Khan who was allotted evacuee land in 
lieu of his verified claim, died in the year 1960 leaving behind a 
son namely Atta Muhammad and children of Ali Muhammad, his 
pre-deceased son. His inheritance mutation was sanctioned on the 
basis of will in favour of children of his pre-deceased son. Atta 
Muhammad appeared before the Revenue Officer at the time of 
sanction of mutation and objected to giving effect to the will. It was 
apprised to the Revenue Officer that Atta Muhammad had been 
dislodged by Samad Khan, therefore, he was deprived of right of 
inheritance in the property of Samad Khan. Said Atta Muhammad 
did not challenge said mutation, however, sons of Ali Muhammad 
instituted a suit for declaration against their sisters with the 
allegation that they are daughters of Muhammad Bibi from her 
previous husband namely Nazir Ahmad and are not daughters of 
Ali Muhammad, therefore, they are not entitled and they (plaintiffs) 
are only entitled to inherit whole property of Samad Khan. The suit 
was dismissed, however, appellate Court reversed the findings and 
decreed the suit but this Court while accepting the Revision Petition, 
set-aside the decree of appellate Court and restored the decree of 
learned appellate Court. The august Supreme Court held as under: 

Civil Revision No.751-D of 2004. 
-12-
 
“The findings of the First Appellate Court that will having not 
been consented to by Atta Muhammad as is clear from the 
proceedings in mutation, the same could not be given effect to 
as according to Muhammadan Law, disposal of property 
through will by a Muhammadan in favour of one of the heirs is 
not effective unless the other heirs after the death of the maker 
of will had consented to are not tenable as it was altogether 
ignored that none of the parties in the presence of Atta 
Muhammad son of Samad Khan were entitled to inherit the 
property from Samad Khan being heirs of his predeceased son 
at the time of his death in 1960, therefore, the will made in 
favour of respondents was not a will made in favour of any 
heir of Samad Khan as such the same was effective even 
without the consent of Atta Muhammad.” 
 
 
From the above discussion, conclusion can easily be drawn 
that a testator can bequest his entire property to a non-heir through 
will in the following cases i.e. where subject to the provision of any 
law for the time being in force, such excess is permitted by a valid 
custom, where there are no heirs of the testator, where the heirs 
existing at the time of the testator‟s death, consent to such bequest 
after his death and where the only heir is the husband or the wife 
and the bequest of such excess does not affect his or her share. 
15. 
The consent given by the heirs may be express or implied. It 
may be oral or in writing. It can also be implied from conduct. 
Where the testator makes a bequest and on his death, the other heirs 
help the legatee in affecting a mutation in name or allow the legatee 
to take exclusive possession of the property, it is proof of the heir‟s 
consent.  
16. 
In the present case Daim, the testator bequested his entire 
property to Ghulam Hussain (a non-heir) through registered will 
deed dated 06.05.1968. After the death of said Daim, his 
inheritance mutation No.2543 was attested on 12.08.1971 (Exh.P-1). 
At the time of sanction of this mutation, his sole legal heir namely 
Allah Diwaya (father of the parties) was present but had not 
objected upon the sanction of mutation on the basis of will. It 
means that he impliedly consented the mutation. Allah Diwaya was 
deprived of right to inherit property as a consequence of mutation 
No.2543 but he did not challenge the same during his lifetime. The 

Civil Revision No.751-D of 2004. 
-13-
petitioners claimed the property through Allah Diwaya as his heirs. 
Petitioner No.1 filed the review petition in the year 1994 after about 
23 years of sanctioning of the mutation which had already been 
given effect in the record of rights. The petitioners who are not 
legal heirs of Daim, therefore, had no locus standi to move any 
petition of review. Similarly the Consolidation Officer has no 
authority to review the mutation after lapse of such long time, 
which otherwise had been sanctioned in accordance with law.  
17. 
The learned Courts below keeping in view facts and 
circumstances of the case and evidence available on the record 
rightly dismissed the suit concurrently. Learned counsel for the 
petitioners failed to point out any mis-reading, non-reading or 
jurisdictional defect in the impugned judgments and decrees of 
learned Courts below. 
18. 
I have also seen no illegality, irregularity and mis-reading or 
non-reading of evidence on the part of learned Courts below while 
passing the impugned judgments and decrees. There are concurrent 
findings of facts recorded by learned courts below and the courts 
below while passing the impugned judgments and decrees have 
considered every piece of evidence, oral as well as documentary, 
produced before them and nothing is shown to have been 
overlooked any part of the record from their judicious consideration. 
The findings of the learned courts below on question of facts and
