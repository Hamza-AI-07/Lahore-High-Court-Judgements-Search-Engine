Vs. 
Additional Sessions Judge/Ex-officio Justice of Peace and others 
JUDGMENT 
 
Date of hearing: 
 
 
15.12.2023 
For the Petitioner: 
Mr Muhammad Waqas Mirza, Advocate. 
For Respondents No.1 & 2: 
Ms Khalida Parveen, Additional Advocate 
General with Muhammad Mansha/ASI. 
For Respondent No.3: 
Rana Waqar Ahmad Khan, Advocate. 
 
 
 
  
 
Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – Respondent No. 3 filed an 
application under section 22-A of the Cr.P.C. with the Ex-officio Justice of 
Peace, Kamoke, stating that Tariq Mehmood (Petitioner herein) was a close 
friend. On 02.02.2022, the Petitioner borrowed Rs. 400,000/- from him and 
issued Cheque No. 57628358 post-dated 04.07.2022 for its repayment, but 
it was dishonoured upon presentation due to insufficient funds. Respondent 
No. 3 alleged that the Petitioner had dishonestly given him a bad cheque 
and had thereby committed a cognizable offence under section 489-F PPC. 
He prayed that a direction be issued to the Respondent SHO to register an 
FIR against him. The Ex-officio Justice of Peace accepted his application 
vide order dated 31.10.2022 (the “Impugned Order”). The Petitioner has 
assailed that order before this Court through this petition under Article 199 
of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. 
2. 
 
Mr Muhammad Waqas Mirza, Advocate, submits that Cheque 
No.57628358 on the basis of which Respondent No.3 seeks to get a 
criminal case registered against the Petitioner is a “self-cheque,” i.e. a 
cheque issued by the account holder to “himself”. He contends that

- 2 - 
criminal liability under section 489-F PPC cannot arise for such a cheque 
because it does not meet the essential elements of the offence. 
3. 
 
On merits, Mr Mirza contends that the Petitioner manufactures 
leather gloves, and the sister of Respondent No.3, Gul-e-Hina, invested 
money with him on a profit-and-loss basis. According to him, the Petitioner 
gave her Cheque Nos. 57628356 and 57628358 for comfort. However, he 
suffered huge losses due to the Covid-19 pandemic and eventually closed 
his business. Gul-e-Hina passed over Cheque No.57628358 to Respondent 
No.3, who concocted a false story and filed an application under section 
22-A Cr.P.C. for registration of FIR as aforesaid and procured the 
Impugned Order. Mr Mirza contends that he never obtained any loan from 
Respondent No.3. 
4. 
 
Ms Khalida Parveen, Additional Advocate General, has 
vehemently opposed this petition. She argues that Cheque No. 57628358 is 
payable to “self or bearer.” The Petitioner's claim that section 489-F PPC 
does not apply to such instruments is based on a misconception.  
5. 
 
Rana Waqar Ahmad Khan, Advocate, has supported the 
Assistant Advocate General, adding that the application of Respondent 
No.3 under section 22-A of the Cr.P.C. discloses the commission of a 
cognizable offence. Hence, the Ex-officio Justice of Peace was justified in 
directing the registration of an FIR. Mr Khan contends that the defence 
plea is unfounded, as the Petitioner issued Cheque No. 57628358 to settle a 
debt with Respondent No. 3. He points out that conflicting claims exist, 
and the truth can only be determined through an investigation initiated after 
the registration of the FIR. This Court cannot adjudicate on the correctness 
of either plea in the current proceedings. 
6. 
 
Heard. Respondent No.3 seeks to prosecute the Petitioner 
under section 489-F PPC which provides: 
489-F. Dishonestly issuing a cheque. – Whoever dishonestly issues a 
cheque towards repayment of a loan or fulfillment of an obligation which 
is dishonoured on presentation, shall be punishable with imprisonment 
which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both, unless he can 
establish, for which the burden of proof shall rest on him, that he had 
made arrangements with his bank to ensure that the cheque would be 
honoured and that the bank was at fault in not honouring the cheque.  
7. 
 
The purpose of enacting section 489-F PPC was to foster 
confidence in the banking system and trustworthiness in conducting 

Writ Petition No. 68498/2022 
 
 
 
- 3 - 
business through cheques. This provision was designed to proactively deter 
individuals from engaging in dishonest practices – specifically, drawing 
cheques without sufficient funds in their bank accounts, thereby inducing 
the payee to act upon the transaction with a false sense of security. 
8. 
 
The canons for the interpretation of penal statutes are well 
settled. In Mirza Shaukat Baig and others v. Shahid Jamil and others 
(PLD 2005 SC 530), the Supreme Court of Pakistan held: 
“(1) 
All penal statutes are to be construed strictly, that is to say, the 
court must see that the thing charged as an offence is within the plain 
meaning of the words used and must not strain the words on any notion 
that there has been a slip, that there has been a casus omisus, that the 
thing is so clearly within the mischief that it must have been intended to 
be included and would have been included if thought of. On the other 
hand, the person charged has a right to say that the thing charged, 
although within the words, is not within the spirit of the enactment. But 
where the thing is brought within the words and within the spirit there a 
penal enactment is to be construed like any other instrument according to 
the fair common sense meaning of the language used, and the court is not 
to find or make any doubt or ambiguity to the language of a penal 
statute, where such doubt or ambiguity would clearly not be found or 
made in the same language in any other instruments.1 
“(2) 
Criminal enactments are not to be extended by construction. 
When an offence against the law is alleged, and when the court has to 
consider whether that alleged offence falls within the language of a 
criminal statute, the court must be satisfied, not only that the spirit of the 
legislative enactment has been violated, but also that the language used 
by the legislature includes the offence in question, and makes it 
criminal.2 
“(3) 
Nothing is to be regarded as within the meaning of the statute 
which is not within the letter – which is not clearly and intelligibly 
described in the very words of the statute itself.3 
“(4) 
Also, in the interpretation of Acts, the elementary rule is to give 
full and accurate effect to every word used in them. The courts in the 
exposition of penal statutes, are not to narrow the construction. They are 
to look at the words in the first instance, and where the words are plain, 
they are to decide on them. If the words be doubtful, they are then to 
have recourse to the subject matter, but at all events, it is only a 
secondary rule. It is not the province of a judge to disregard or go outside 
the letter of the enactment according to its true construction.4” 
9. 
 
Section 489-F PPC should be interpreted following the 
principles outlined above. This provision does not apply to every instance 
of a dishonoured cheque. The foundational elements to constitute the 
offence are: (i) the cheque was duly issued; (ii) it was issued with dishonest

intent; (iii) it was issued towards repayment of a loan or fulfilment of an 
obligation; and (iv) it was dishonoured on presentation. In Muhammad 
Sultan v. The State (2010 SCMR 806), the Supreme Court of Pakistan held 
that “fulfillment of an obligation” is a broad term and is, inter alia, 
applicable to all lawful agreements and contracts. 
10. 
 
Section 489-F PPC is not a strict liability offence, which is 
evident from the word “dishonestly” used therein. Section 24 of the PPC 
defines the term “dishonestly” to mean anything done with the intention of 
causing wrongful gain to one person or wrongful loss to another. Whether 
the issuer/drawer of a cheque has issued it dishonestly is a question of fact 
that the prosecution must establish in every case. 
11. 
 
In the present case, Cheque No.57628358 specifies:  
“Pay Self or bearer”. The word “self” is handwritten while “or bearer” is 
printed. The first question that needs determination is whether criminal 
proceedings under section 489-F PPC can be initiated against the issuer of 
a cheque made out to oneself in the event of dishonour. To answer this 
query, we must delve into the definition of a cheque. 
12. 
 
Section 6 of the NIA defines a “cheque” as “a bill of exchange 
drawn on a specified banker and not expressed to be payable otherwise 
than on demand.” Section 5 of the Act defines “bill of exchange”5 and 
explains that a bill of exchange may be drawn in the name of a particular 
person, or payable to his order or bearer. Section 3(c) of the NIA states, 
 “ „bearer‟ means a person who by negotiation comes into possession of a 
negotiable instrument, which is payable to bearer.” Negotiation can be by  
 
                                          
5 Section 5 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, in relevant part reads as follows: 
5. “Bill of exchange”.– A “bill of exchange” is an instrument in writing containing an 
unconditional order, signed by the maker, directing a certain person to pay on demand or at a 
fixed or determinable future time a certain sum of money only to, or to the order of, a certain 
person or to the bearer of the instrument.  
 
…  
 
Where the person intended can reasonably be ascertained from the promissory note or the bill of 
exchange, he is a „certain person‟ within the meaning of this section and section 4, although he is 
misnamed or designated by description only.  
 
…  
 
Where the payee is a fictitious or non-existing person the bill of exchange may be treated as 
payable to bearer. 

Writ Petition No. 68498/2022 
 
 
 
- 5 - 
delivery (section 47)6 or endorsement (section 48).7 A cheque payable to 
the bearer can be negotiated through simple delivery, whereas one payable 
to order requires endorsement. Thus, a bearer cheque has an independent 
legal standing and identity and does not depend on any endorsement for its 
validity. Linking its validity and independent status with any positive 
endorsement is inappropriate. 
13. 
 
A review of the above provisions shows that a cheque is a 
kind of bill of exchange with certain peculiarities. In view of section 5, 
ibid, where the payee is a fictitious or non-existing person, it may be 
treated as payable to the bearer. 
14. 
 
A “self-cheque” has neither been defined by the Pakistan 
Penal Code nor the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881 (the “NIA”). 
Essentially, it refers to a cheque where the drawer is also the payee. 
15. 
 
Section 489-F PPC does not stipulate that the cheque must be 
in the name of a specific individual. It simply requires that the person 
drawing the cheque does so from his own account, and the purpose should 
be for loan repayment or fulfilling a legal obligation. If the cheque is made 
to “self” only, no offence is committed. Firstly, a person cannot dishonestly 
issue a cheque to pay money to himself, and secondly, a person cannot give 
a cheque for the payment of a loan or to fulfil an obligation that one has 
towards oneself. 
16. 
 
When a cheque is addressed as payable to “self or bearer”  
(and the word “bearer” is not scored off), any person who qualifies as a 
“holder in due course” under section 9 of NIA can initiate legal action 
under section 489-F PPC, provided they satisfy the elements of the offence 
described in paragraph 9 above. An individual asserting the status of a 
holder in due course must also substantiate their claim if challenged. 
17. 
 
Section 118 of the NIA outlines certain presumptions about 
negotiable instruments, but these do not extend to section 489-F PPC. The 
latter provision exclusively governs the prosecution of the offence. 
                                          
6 47. 
Negotiation by delivery.– Subject to the provisions of section 58, a promissory note, bill of 
exchange or cheque payable to bearer is negotiable by delivery thereof. 
  
Exception. A promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque delivered on condition that it is not to 
take effect except in a certain event is not negotiable (except in the hands of a holder for value without 
notice of the condition) unless such event happens. 
7 48. 
Negotiation by indorsement.– Subject to the provisions of section 58, a promissory note, bill of 
exchange or cheque payable to order is negotiable by the holder by indorsement and delivery thereof.

Significantly, it does not raise any statutory presumption in favour of the 
holder of a cheque. 
18. 
 
India has criminalized the dishonour of cheques by inserting 
section 138 in the Indian Negotiable of Instruments Act 1881  
(the “Indian Act”), which shares some similarities with Pakistan‟s section 
489-F PPC. The Indian courts have considered the issue of criminal 
liability of a self-cheque in a catena of cases. In Mahesh Goyal v. S.K. 
Sharma (1997 CriLJ 2868 (P & H)), the Punjab and Haryana High Court 
held that if other conditions are met, merely because the cheque is 
addressed to self does not exempt it from the applicability of section 138 of 
the Indian Act. Once the cheque has been given for valid consideration, the 
respondent must be considered a holder in due course. The Kerala High 
Court, in Michael Kuruvilla v. Joseph J Kondody, [1998(2) Andh. LD 
(Cri) 957) (Ker)], following the judgment of the same Court in A.K. 
Hameed v. Appakutty (AIR 1969 Ker. 189), and considering the definition 
of “holder in due course” under section 9 of the Indian Act (analogous to 
section 9 of the NIA), held that even if the cheque lacks the payee‟s name, 
the printed words “or bearer” are struck off, and it is written “pay to cash,” 
it remains a legal and valid negotiable instrument. It must be implied that 
the direction is to pay to the bearer, and there is no evidence to suggest that 
the appellant cannot be treated as a holder in due course under section 9 of 
the Indian Act. With these observations, the learned Judge overturned the 
trial court‟s judgment, finding the accused guilty of the offence under 
section 138 of the Indian Act, and convicted him accordingly. In  
Intech Net Limited and others v. State and another, (2007 Cri.LJ 216), 
Andhra High Court held: 
 
“Once the issuance of the cheques is admitted and as the words “or 
bearer” have not been struck off, the complainant is held to be the holder 
of the said cheques in due course though it was written as self and thus 
he is entitled to receive the cash and on dishonouring of the said cheques, 
he can very well file the complaint. The contention of the petitioners that 
the said cheques was issued in the process of transaction between the 
first petitioner and the complainant for supply of goods has to be 
substantiated during the course of trial by the petitioners by leading 
evidence. Under these circumstances, I see no ground to quash the 
impugned proceedings at this stage.”

19. 
 
In Dr. Shreeyansh Rayappa Nandeshwar v. Dr. Prakash 
Ponde,8 the Karnataka High Court held: 
 
“Having perused the principles laid down in the Judgment, the very 
contention that there is no endorsement and the self cheque does not 
attract Section 138 of the [Indian Act], cannot be accepted at this 
juncture.” 
 
 
Further reference can be made to Farhat Hussain Siddiqui v. 
State of U.P. and another (2010 Cri.LJ 1213), B. Sarvothama v. S.M. 
Haneef (2013 SCC OnLine Ker 5328), Adigear International v. State 
(2013 SCC OnLine Del. 4938), and Sarafudheen v, T. Muhammed Ashraf 
[2016 (3) ILR (Kerala) 645]. 
20. 
 
While there are similarities between Pakistan‟s section 489-F 
PPC and section 138 of the Indian Act, they differ substantively. As 
adumbrated, the most crucial distinction is that the vital ingredient of the 
section 489-F PPC is the dishonest issuance of a cheque, a requirement that 
every holder of a cheque, including the bearer of a self-cheque, must 
establish. 
21. 
 
In the present case, Cheque No. 57628358 is made payable to 
“self,” and the words “or bearer” remain uncrossed. According to 
Respondent No.3, the Petitioner handed it over to him in the presence of 
two witnesses, Muhammad Ashraf and Majid Ali, to repay a loan. 
Therefore, he was a holder in due course. The cheque was dishonoured due 
to insufficient funds in the Petitioner‟s account, and the bank issued a 
memo to Respondent No.3 confirming this fact. 
22. 
 
The Petitioner neither disputes his signature on Cheque No. 
57628358 nor that it is drawn on his account. Instead, he challenges its 
validity by claiming it does not fulfil the requirements of section 5 of the 
NIA. In view of the law discussed above, this contention is repelled. 
23. 
 
Section 154 Cr.P.C. mandates the officer in charge of a police 
station to register an FIR when informed about the commission of a 
cognizable offence. It is a settled law that he cannot determine the veracity 
of the information/allegations at that stage. The application under section 
22-A Cr.P.C. submitted by Respondent No.3 prima facie indicates the 
commission of a cognizable offence. Therefore, the Respondent SHO must

proceed under section 154 Cr.P.C. and investigate the various aspects of 
the case in light of this judgment.  
24. 
 
The Impugned Order does not require interference by this 
Court. This petition has no merit and is, therefore, dismissed.
