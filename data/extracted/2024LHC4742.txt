Background of the cases 
2. 
 
The national print and electronic media have sporadically 
reported incidents of abuse involving young girls in various Dar-ul-Amans 
(shelter homes) across Punjab. In November 2019, Ms. Afshan Latif, a former 

Writ Petition No.10511/2020 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       2 
Superintendent of Kashana (Lahore), a shelter for destitute and orphaned girls 
established by the Government of Punjab and managed by the Department of 
Social Welfare and Bait-ul-Maal (the “Social Welfare Department”), came 
in public and made horrifying statements about Kashana‟s state of affairs. She 
inter alia alleged that the girls residing there were sexually abused and 
subjected to forced marriages in violation of the law and their fundamental 
rights. The Kashana Scandal, as it came to be called, received extensive 
media coverage and prompted numerous complaints about other children‟s 
homes and orphanages. The public outcry led to an investigation by the Chief 
Minister‟s Inspection Team (CMIT) into Ms. Latif‟s allegations. The CMIT 
has submitted a copy of its report dated 15.10.2019 with its para-wise 
comments in this Court. The CMIT found that Ms. Afshan Latif‟s allegations 
were false and recommended disciplinary proceedings against her under the 
PEEDA Act 2006 for inefficiency and misconduct. Ms. Afshan has 
challenged those proceedings in Writ Petition No.76827/2019, which is 
currently pending. However, the CMIT made the following observations 
regarding Kashna‟s functioning/operations: 
“i) 
It appears that the Department of Social Welfare and Bait-ul-Maal 
Punjab has not issued proper SOPs regarding the functioning of 
Kashana. However, CMIT has received some self-prepared SOPs 
from Kashana Rawalpindi which were neither approved nor notified 
by the Department. However, according to the website of the Social 
Welfare and Bait-ul-Maal Department, the eligibility criteria for 
enrollment in the home for destitute girls (Kashana) is that the 
applicant should be of age 10 to 16, orphan or destitute girls, girls 
with single parents or at least with guardian are given preference of 
admission and applicant should be medically fit. The application 
form duly verified by the Chairman of the Local Zakat Committee 
or referred to by some gazetted officer is accepted. CMIT has 
observed that most inmates have families and homes and hail from 
Lahore. Some inmates were from Kasur and Sahiwal. As such, no 
homeless inmates were found at the time of visit. The 
Administrative Department has not framed a uniform and standard 
policy to accommodate only those inmates who fulfill the 
requirements. 
ii) 
There is no proper periodical inspection regime which is required 
for the check and balance system. Such a loose administration can 
create room for malpractices and corruption. The hierarchical 
structure, like the Divisional Director and Deputy Director, has no 
control over Kashana, Lahore. 
iii) 
… 
iv) 
No rules, regulations or policy is available with the Superintendent 
administering the affairs of Kashana. There is no uniform criterion 
for admission and relieving of inmate girls. So much so that the 
admission form does not provide any preconditions for admission of 
inmates. Moreover, there is no system for students to follow up in 
terms of their education and health. Copies of students enrolled in 

Writ Petition No.10511/2020 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       3 
different schools are not properly checked. Further, no I.T., 
technical, or vocational training is being imparted to the inmates. 
v) 
Similarly, 
CMIT 
observed 
no 
nutritional, 
emotional, 
or 
psychological care to inculcate social and moral values in Kashana. 
Regarding medical aid, the Superintendent claimed that medical 
facilities were being provided to inmates but no such record was 
shown. As regards the nutritional needs of inmates, the 
Superintendent could only show a menu of last month, which means 
that there is a hotchpotch system that could not delineate how the 
meals were being provided to inmates and whether the meals were 
enough to fulfill their nutritional needs. As far as the psychological 
and emotional health of inmates is concerned, Kashana does not 
provide any psychological help to them. Kashana does not have a 
proper approval mechanism for shifting inmates to mental hospital. 
The procedure adopted by the Incharge Kashana was found 
inadequate. 
vi) 
No system of record management is in place. There was no separate 
register for the inventory of donations received from philanthropists. 
Prima facie, no transparent methodology is available to distinguish 
the expenditure incurred from regular budget or donations. The 
Superintendent could not produce any cash book, vouchers, ledger, 
or bill register, which means that the expenditure incurred from the 
government budget and donations are not being properly accounted 
for. 
vii) 
… 
viii) 
The Superintendent Kashana was asked to provide minutes of the 
meetings of Advisory Committee which she failed to provide. 
However, the monthly progress report of Kashana pertaining to the 
month of July 2019 shows that the advisory committee has been de-
notified, and it does not exist right now. The absence of SOPs, lack 
of an audit regime, and de-notification of the Advisory Committee 
show that Kashana has a dilly-dally administrative setup running on 
the whims of the In-charge. 
ix) 
As far as the position of budget and expenditure for the financial 
years 2016-17, 2017-18, and 2018-19, and the first quarter of 2019-
20 is concerned, Kashana has received Rs.5,272,300/- against which 
an amount of Rs.3,652,228/- has been expended. Similarly, against 
the final release of Rs.11,562,800/-, Superintendent Kashana has 
incurred an amount of Rs.11,423,370/- during the financial year 
2017-18. An amount of Rs.13,053,400/- was released during the 
financial year 2018-19, against which an expenditure of 
Rs.11,674,203/- has been booked. As regards the first quarter of the 
financial year 2019-20, an amount of Rs.3,061,000/- has so far been 
released, against which an expenditure of Rs.294,448/- has been 
shown. However, the fact remains that Superintendent Kashana or 
the Department could not provide vouchers or receipts of any 
amount expended during the aforementioned financial years.” 
3. 
 
The CMIT made the following recommendations to improve 
Kashana‟s working: 
i)  
A well-defined Standing Operating Procedures should be developed 
by the Department for Kashana, displayed at a visible place, and 
followed in letter and spirit. 
ii) 
An overarching policy framework stipulating admission and 
relieving of inmates may be devised whereby only destitute girl 
children from the age of 10 to 16 may be admitted after complete 
scrutiny of family history with evidence that girls being admitted 
should be orphan, homeless, coming from broken families, single

       4 
parent who has no capacity or will to financially support her or the 
girls having no guardian. The Administrative Department ought to 
frame a uniform and standard policy to accommodate only those 
inmates who fulfill the aforementioned pre-requisites. A set of rules 
and regulations may also be devised by the Administrative 
Department in light of the Social Welfare and Bait-ul-Maal 
Department‟s policy. 
iii) 
A proper check and balance system may be put in place with a 
regular feature of periodical and random inspection and monitoring 
of Institutions like Kashana, which at present exhibits a loose 
administrative setup in order to curb the elements of malpractices 
and corruption. 
iv) 
The Department should arrange pre-service and in-service training 
facilities for the officers like the Superintendent, Warden, Social 
Medical Officer, and Social Welfare Officers on customized 
modules of the financial management role of DDOs and HRM to 
ensure that they could handle the institutions like Kashana in future 
following the procedures to be laid down in rules & policy. 
v) 
The educational, medical, and psychological needs of inmate girls of 
Kashana must be addressed, and regular services of doctors and 
psychologists should be provided to them. 
vi) 
Kashana does not have a proper approval mechanism for shifting 
inmates to mental hospital. The shifting of inmates to mental 
hospital or halfway home may be allowed only on the basis of 
medical certificates issued by the doctors. 
vii) 
A system of record management may be put in place in Kashana. A 
separate register for inventory of donations received from 
philanthropists may be maintained, and such inventory may be 
properly reported to the Administrative Department. Similarly, the 
record of expenditure incurred from regular budget may be 
maintained and inspected by an officer appointed by the 
Administrative Department. 
viii) 
The schooling of inmate girls may be properly checked with a 
follow-up system. Further, training of inmates in I.T., technical or 
vocational fields may also be ensured. 
ix)  
The success stories of the Child Protection Bureau and other 
institutions may be studied to make room for improvement in 
Kashana. The Administrative Department may like to benefit from 
the systems adopted by the successful institutions. 
4. 
 
The then Chief Minister, Punjab, approved the CMIT‟s above-
mentioned recommendations and directed “immediate compliance” vide order 
dated 20.12.2019. The CMIT has furnished a copy of the said order to this 
Court. 
5. 
 
The Kashana Scandal is directly at issue in Ms. Afshan Latif‟s 
Writ Petition No. 76827/2019, supra. While the present petitions also stem 
from that scandal, their focus is broader. They question the regulation and 
oversight of various shelter homes and protection facilities for women and 
children in Punjab. The Petitioners contend that the Chief Minister‟s order 
dated 20.12.2019 has been disregarded. They urge this Court to invoke its 
constitutional jurisdiction and issue directives to the relevant authorities to 

Writ Petition No.10511/2020 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       5 
safeguard the fundamental rights of vulnerable women and children residing 
in these shelter homes. 
6. 
 
In W.P. No. 78009/2019, the following questions of law emerge: 
(i) 
Under what legislative framework does the Government of Punjab 
establish and operate the shelter homes/Dar-ul-Amans and Women 
Protection Centres? 
(ii) 
Which government institution is responsible for the establishment, 
administration, and oversight mechanisms of shelter homes/Dar-ul-
Amans and various women‟s protection centres established across 
Punjab? 
(iii) 
Has the Government of Punjab defined and distinguished the 
jurisdictions and mandates of the Punjab Social Welfare and  
Bait-ul-Maal Department and Women 
Protection 
Authority 
(established under the Punjab Women Protection Authority Act 
2017) concerning shelter homes and protection centres?  
(iv) 
What is the status of the implementation of the Punjab Protection of 
Women against Violence Act, 2016, under which the Punjab 
Government is mandated to establish Protection Centres and shelter 
homes across Punjab? 
(v) 
What oversight mechanisms, including complaint management 
systems, are in place to ensure the safety, protection, and well-being 
of residents of the government-run Dar-ul-Amans/shelter homes, 
and are they adequate?  
(vi) 
How are the privately run shelter homes regulated? Is there any 
legislative framework in place? 
(vii) 
What specific measures should be implemented regarding the 
marriage of residents in Dar-ul-Amans, and what regulatory 
framework should govern such matters? 
7. 
 
W.P. No. 10511/2020 raises the following issues: 
(i) 
How is the Province of the Punjab establishing and operating 
different institutions for the welfare of children? 
(ii) 
Which government institutions/departments are responsible for 
administering and overseeing the child protection mechanisms in 
Punjab? 
8. 
 
Similar questions arise in the other two petitions. 
Pakistan’s international commitments 
9. 
 
The international legal framework concerning women‟s rights to 
protection and shelter is anchored in several key human rights instruments 
and conventions that collectively aim to address and mitigate the 
vulnerabilities faced by women globally. The Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights (UDHR) is central to this framework, which articulates the 
right to an adequate standard of living, including housing, under Article 25. 
This foundational document underscores the inherent dignity and equality of 

Writ Petition No.10511/2020 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       6 
all individuals, laying the groundwork for subsequent treaties and declarations 
that specifically address gender-based discrimination and violence. 
10. 
 
The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), adopted in 1979, is one of the 
most significant instruments in this regard. CEDAW mandates that States 
eliminate discrimination against women and ensure their access to rights in 
various spheres of life. It calls for the provision of shelters and support 
services to women who are victims of violence, emphasizing the importance 
of creating safe environments where women can seek refuge and support.1 
11. 
 
Similar protections exist under the International Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination,2 the Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,3 and the Beijing Declaration and 
Platform for Action of 1995, to which Pakistan is a signatory. The Beijing 
Platform serves as a comprehensive global policy framework for gender 
equality and the fundamental rights of women and girls. Strategic Objective 
D.1. of the Declaration calls for integrating measures to prevent and eliminate 
violence against women. Paragraph 125(a) of Objective D.1 specifically 
recommends that States provide “well-funded shelters and relief support for 
girls and women subjected to violence, as well as medical, psychological, and 
other counseling services and free or low-cost legal aid where needed, as well 
as appropriate assistance to enable them to find a means of subsistence.”4 
12. 
 
Specifically on the right to housing as a vital component of the 
right to an adequate standard of living, the United Nations Special Rapporteur 
on Adequate Housing has provided several guidelines with specific 
implementation measures for States, public authorities, and regional and local 
governments for the implementation of the right to adequate housing.5 The 
                                         
1 While CEDAW does not specifically reference “housing”, its provisions on non-discrimination, safety, and 
protection have been widely interpreted as including the right to shelter and safe housing for women. General 
Recommendation No. 19 on violence against women highlights that States should provide protective and 
support services, like shelters, for women at risk. 
2 Article 5(e)(iii) of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 
specifically includes “the right to housing” as a right that States Parties must guarantee on a non-
discriminatory basis. This obligates States Parties to actively ensure that housing is accessible to all 
individuals without racial discrimination.

first guideline recognizes the right to adequate housing as “integral to core 
human rights values such as dignity, equality, inclusion, well-being, security 
of the person and public participation” and calls on States to “guarantee the 
right to housing as a fundamental human right linked to dignity and the right 
to life”.6 Guideline 9 calls for ensuring gender equality in housing and land by 
recognizing it “as a central component of women‟s right to substantive 
equality”. The guidelines recognize domestic violence as one of the leading 
causes of homelessness for women and that the “lack of alternative housing 
options for women experiencing violence in the home places their security 
and lives at risk”.7 It calls for reforming laws, policies, and practices so they 
“alleviate the systemic disadvantages that women experience.” Furthermore, 
the guideline also calls for the provision of emergency shelters and prompt 
access to front-line crisis services to those women who face household 
violence.8 
13. 
 
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 
(UNCRC), adopted in 1989, is the primary international treaty that sets out 
the comprehensive framework for children‟s rights. Under the UNCRC, 
children are entitled to special protection and assistance to ensure their 
physical, mental, and social well-being. This includes the right to adequate 
housing and shelter, as articulated in Article 27, which calls on States Parties 
to ensure that every child has the right to a standard of living adequate for 
their physical, mental, spiritual, moral, and social development. 
14. 
 
Moreover, the UNCRC mandates States to protect children from 
all forms of abuse, neglect, exploitation, and violence and to take measures to 
prevent such occurrences. Article 19 specifically addresses protection from 
violence, including physical and mental violence, injury, abuse, and neglect. 
States are required to establish appropriate social programmes for the 
prevention of abuse and the treatment of victims. The UNCRC also 
emphasizes the importance of the family environment for the upbringing and

development of the child, advocating for alternative care when necessary and 
ensuring that it is consistent with the child‟s best interests. 
15. 
 
In addition to the UNCRC, other international instruments and 
conventions further protect children‟s rights to protection and shelter. These 
include the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
(ICESCR), which recognizes the right of everyone, including children, to an 
adequate standard of living, which encompasses housing, and the Optional 
Protocol to the CRC on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child 
Pornography, which enhances protection against exploitation and trafficking. 
International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 182 on the 
Worst Forms of Child Labour underscores protections needed for children‟s 
well-being, including shelter and protection from hazardous conditions.  
The United Nations Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children 
emphasize the importance of family and community-based care and provide 
principles for the protection and well-being of children who are in alternative 
care settings.  
16. 
 
Beyond the above-mentioned global agreements, regional human 
rights treaties also play crucial roles in protecting and promoting women‟s 
and children‟s rights. These instruments provide a basis for advocacy, policy 
development, and accountability, urging governments to adopt measures that 
effectively address gender inequalities and ensure that women have access to 
safe housing and support services. 
17. 
 
Pakistan is a signatory to almost all the international conventions 
and agreements that protect the rights of women and children. Over the last 
two decades, the Government has taken various steps to incorporate human 
rights values into its statutes, policies, and action plans.  
Right to shelter under the Constitution of Pakistan 
18. 
 
The 
framers 
of 
the 
1973 
Constitution 
of 
Pakistan  
(the “Constitution”) envisioned the creation of a “new social order” based on 
egalitarian principles.9 The right to housing, though not expressly mentioned 
in the Constitution as a fundamental right, can be inferred from Article 9 
(right to life and liberty), Article 14 (right to dignity), and Article 25 (right to 
equality). In Shehla Zia and others v. WAPDA (PLD 1994 SC 693), the 
                                         
9 Preamble of the Constitution of 1973 

Writ Petition No.10511/2020 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       9 
Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled that the word “life” in Article 9 covers all 
facets of human existence. It stated: “The word „life‟ has not been defined in 
the Constitution, but it does not mean nor can it be restricted only to the 
vegetative or animal life or mere existence from conception to death. Life 
includes all such amenities and facilities which a person born in a free country 
is entitled to enjoy with dignity, legally and constitutionally.” The Supreme 
Court interpreted “life” to include all rights necessary for a free, proper, 
comfortable, and clean life, drawing parallels with the United States 
Constitution and Indian jurisprudence. Later, in Employees of the Pakistan 
Law Commission v. Ministry of Works (1994 SCMR 1548), the Supreme 
Court specifically ruled that the right to housing is a part of the right to life. In 
this case, the employees of the Pakistan Law Commission had filed a petition 
under Article 184(3) of the Constitution praying for allotment of official 
residences. The Supreme Court stated: 
“It is thus clear that Article 9 of the Constitution, which guarantees life and 
liberty according to law, is not to be construed in a restricted and pedantic 
manner. Life has a larger concept, which includes the right to enjoyment of 
life, and maintaining an adequate level of living for full enjoyment of 
freedom and rights. In this background, the petitioners‟ claim to be provided 
accommodation during the tenure of service, which is necessary for 
maintaining an adequate level of living, in our opinion, is covered by 
Article 9.” 
(emphasis added) 
19. 
 
The right to housing can be extrapolated within our Constitution 
if Article 9 is read in conjunction with 38(d), which falls in Part-II Chapter 2 
of the Constitution under the heading “Principles of Policy”. In Olga Tellis 
and 
others 
v. 
Bombay 
Municipal 
Corporation 
and 
others  
(AIR 1986 SC 180), the Supreme Court of India explained that the Principles 
of Policy must be regarded as equally fundamental in the understanding and 
interpretation of the meaning and content of fundamental rights. The relevant 
excerpt is reproduced below: 
“The Principles [of Policy] contained in Articles 39(a) and 41 must be 
regarded as equally fundamental in the understanding and interpretation of 
the meaning and content of fundamental rights. If there is an obligation 
upon the State to secure the citizens an adequate means of livelihood and 
the right to work, it would be sheer pedantry to exclude the right to 
livelihood from the content of the right to life. The State may not, by 
affirmative action, be compellable to provide adequate means of livelihood 
or work to the citizens. But, any person who is deprived of their right to 
livelihood except according to just and fair procedure established by law, 
can challenge the deprivation as offending the right to life conferred by 
Article 21.”

While the right to housing, recognized as a fundamental right of 
citizens, obliges the State to ensure that every individual has access to 
adequate housing, reflecting the State‟s commitment to social justice and 
equality, the State‟s duty extends beyond this general obligation when it 
comes to vulnerable groups such as orphans, children, and women who are 
subjected to violence and abuse. Here, the doctrine of parens patriae comes 
into play, which refers to the State‟s role as a guardian for those who are 
unable to care for themselves. Under this doctrine, the State assumes a 
protective role, providing housing, essential care and support systems tailored 
to the specific needs of these vulnerable populations. Safe spaces are 
fundamental for women and girls to access their rights. A network of well-
run, adequately resourced, and effective shelter homes and protection centres 
is vital for women and girl survivors of violence. With proper regulation and 
oversight, these shelter homes and protection centres can become sanctuaries 
of hope, resilience, and empowerment for women and girls, supporting their 
rehabilitation and reintegration into society. 
History of the establishment of government-run shelter homes and 
protection centres for women 
21. 
 
The history of the establishment of shelter homes/Dar-ul-Aman 
is not well documented. Apparently, the first Dar-ul-Aman, Dua, was 
established in Lahore in 1963 by a private institution Anjuman-e-Himayat-e-
Islam.10 Although the Lahore Dua was private, it had patronage from the 
Social Welfare Department.11  
22. 
 
The Government of Punjab also established Dar-ul-Falahs, 
which are mother and children homes in which widowed/divorced, separated, 
and needy women with children are admitted and over a period of time 
rehabilitated in society. As per the Social Welfare Department‟s website, the 
first Dar-ul-Falah was established in Sialkot in 1966. There are now six  
Dar-ul-Falahs 
working 
in 
the 
divisional 
headquarters 
of 
Punjab  
(Lahore, Sargodha, Rawalpindi, Sialkot, Multan, and Bahawalpur), and each 
home can accommodate 30 women along with their children.12

Subsequently, during the period between 1973 and 1986, the 
Government of Punjab, under the then Ministry of Social Welfare, Women 
Development and Bait-ul-Maal, established eight Rescue Homes for women 
who were victims of violence had left their homes and needed immediate 
shelter.13 Rescue Homes were first established in the eight former divisional 
headquarters of the Punjab (Lahore, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, 
Sargodha, Multan, Bahawalpur, and Dera Ghazi Khan).14  
24. 
 
In 2004, the Social Welfare Department envisaged a scheme, 
namely “Strengthening and Capacity Building of Eight Existing Shelter 
Homes & Establishment of Shelter Homes in the remaining 27 districts of 
Punjab.” As a result, 27 new women‟s shelter homes, called “Dar-ul-Amans” 
were established.15 As of today, there are a total of 36 Dar-ul-Amans 
established in all districts of Punjab, and these homes claim to accommodate 
20 to 50 women at a time, as per the Social Welfare Department website.16 
25. 
 
The Federal Government established the Shaheed Benazir Bhutto 
Human Rights Crisis Centres for Women (“Crisis Centres”) across Pakistan, 
administered by the Federal Ministry of Women Development. These were 
among the earliest shelters for women facing violence and abuse. After the 
Eighteenth Constitutional Amendment, the management of these centres was 
transferred to the provincial governments. In 2014, twelve centres were 
officially handed over to the Social Welfare Department. These centres are 
now located in Bahawalpur, Dera Ghazi Khan, Faisalabad, Muzaffargarh, 
Khushab, Lahore, Multan, Rawalpindi, Sahiwal, Mianwali, Sialkot, and 
Vehari.17 
26. 
 
In March 2017, one Violence Against Women Centre (VAWC) 
was established in District Multan under the Punjab Protection of Women 
Against Violence Act, 2016.18

Legal framework 
27. 
 
The following are the primary laws/rules that deal with shelter 
homes and protection centres for women in Punjab:  
i) 
Punjab Government Rules of Business, 2011; 
ii) 
The Punjab Protection of Women Against Violence Act, 2016; and 
iii) 
The Punjab Women Protection Authority Act, 2017. 
28. 
 
As noted above, the Government of Punjab patronized the 
private institution Dar-ul-Aman established in Lahore, but it is unclear under 
what law this was done. Similarly, no legislation existed at the time to 
authorize the Social Welfare Department or the Punjab Government to set up 
the rescue homes referred to above. The Dar-ul-Amans in other districts, 
created under a “government scheme,” also lack a clear legislative mandate 
for the Social Welfare Department or the Punjab Government to implement 
such a scheme. This ambiguity extends to the establishment of Dar-ul-Falahs. 
29. 
 
According to the para-wise comments submitted by the Social 
Welfare Department, Dar-ul-Amans and Dar-ul-Falahs were established 
under the authority granted by the Punjab Government Rules of Business, 
2011. These institutions are regulated by guidelines, standard operating 
procedures (SOPs), and minimum care standards issued by the Department 
from time to time.  
30. 
 
It is also unclear under which law the Federal Ministry of 
Women Development established the Crisis Centres, and following the 
Eighteenth Amendment, under which provincial laws they are currently 
administered and regulated. The regulation of these centres appears to be 
governed by the SOPs developed by the Women Development Department, 
which remain in effect. 
The Punjab Protection of Women against Violence Act, 2016  
31. 
 
In 2016, the Punjab Assembly enacted the Punjab Protection of 
Women against Violence Act, 2016 (the “Women Protection Act”), which 
was subsequently amended in 2022.19 This is the only law directly dealing  
 
                                         
19 The Punjab Protection of Women Against Violence (Amendment) Act 2022. 

Writ Petition No.10511/2020 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       13 
with establishing and administrating Protection Centres20 and shelter homes21 
in the province. Under Section 13 of the said Act, Protection Centres and 
shelter homes were to be set up in each district in Punjab. Initially, the Act 
was notified only for District Multan, with the establishment of a Protection 
Centre under Section 13 through a notification dated 22.03.2017. Later, the 
Act was extended to the entire province of Punjab, following approval from 
the Punjab Government in its 3rd meeting held on 04.11.2022, and through a 
notification dated 18.11.2022. Around the same time, the Punjab Protection of 
Women Against Violence (Amendment) Act 2022 (the “Amendment Act of 
2022”) was also enacted. 
32. 
 
It is necessary to highlight that, aside from Multan District, no 
shelter homes or protection centres have been established in any other district 
of Punjab under the Women Protection Act. 
33. 
 
The Amendment Act of 2022 introduced changes to the Women 
Protection Act (2016), including in sub-sections (6) and (7) of Section 13.22 
Under these amendments, where a Protection Centre or shelter home is not 
established under the Women Protection Act, the Secretary of the Social 
Welfare Department may, subject to such terms and conditions as he may 
determine, declare any existing government facility, centre, or institution 
providing similar services as a Protection Centre or shelter home for the 
purposes of this Act. Following these amendments, the Secretary declared the 
36 existing Dar-ul-Amans in all districts of Punjab as shelter homes. 
                                         
20 Section 2(1)(l) of the Punjab Protection of Women Against Violence Act 2016 defines “Protection Centre” 
as under: 
(l) 
“Protection Centre” means a Violence against Women Centre established or declared under 
the Act. 
21 Section 2(1)(q) of the Punjab Protection of Women Against Violence Act 2016 defines “shelter home” as 
follows: 
(q) 
“shelter home” means a premises established or licensed by the Government under the Act 
to provide board and lodging and rehabilitation services to the aggrieved persons, other 
women and their children. 
22 For facility of reference, sub-sections (6) and (7) of Section 13 (as amended) are reproduced below: 
(6) 
Where a Protection Centre or shelter home is not established under this section, the 
Secretary may, subject to such terms and conditions as he may determine, declare any existing 
Government facility, centre, or institution providing similar services as Protection Centre or shelter 
home for purposes of this Act. 
(7) 
Where any existing facility, centre or institution is declared as Protection Centre or shelter 
home under sub-section (6), the infra-structure, paraphernalia, assets and the employees of such 
facility, centre or institution shall remain under the administrative control of the Social Welfare and 
Bait-ul-Ma.l Department of the Government: 
Provided that the service structure and terms and conditions of service of the employees of 
such facility, centre, or institution shall continue to be governed under the law, rules, and policies 
applicable to them for the time being in force. 

Writ Petition No.10511/2020 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       14 
Additionally, 11 existing Crisis Centres and 25 Dar-ul-Amans were notified 
as “Protection Centres” under Section 13(7), effective from 21.12.2022.  
34. 
 
The table below summarizes the existing shelter homes and 
Protection Centres for women: 
 
Shelter Homes 
36 Dar-ul-Amans  
07 Dar-ul-Falahs (not declared as shelther homes 
under s.13(6) but house widowed women and their 
dependent children) 
Protection 
Centres  
25 Dar-ul-Amans 
11 Crisis Centres 
1 VAWC in Multan 
35. 
 
By declaring all Dar-ul-Amans and 11 Crisis Centres as shelter 
homes and Protection Centres under the amended Women Protection Act, 
these institutions now have a legal mandate for their operation, which was 
previously lacking. 
Punjab Women Protection Authority Act, 2017. 
36. 
 
The Punjab Assembly also enacted the Punjab Women 
Protection Authority Act, 2017 for the provision of a comprehensive, 
efficient, effective, and gender-equitable system for the protection, relief, and 
rehabilitation of women against all forms of violence in the Punjab; to 
control, monitor, and oversee that system; and to deal with matters ancillary 
thereto.23 The said Act establishes the Punjab Women Protection Authority 
(the “PWPA”), an autonomous statutory and corporate body.24 Section 6 
outlines its powers and functions, which inter alia include: (i) establishing, 
maintaining, monitoring, governing, operating, and constructing Protection 
Centres in Punjab; (ii) executing, implementing, and administering the 
protection system and providing relief and rehabilitation for women against 
violence; (iii) issuing necessary instructions, directions, or guidelines to the 
District Women Protection Committees, District Women Protection Officers, 
or any other officers or officials engaged in the protection system, or to any 
other body for the implementation of the projects of the PWPA and the 
effective implementation of the provisions of the Punjab Women Protection 
Authority Act 2017 and the Women Protection Act 2016; and (iv) formulating

       15 
and ensuring minimum standards, a code of conduct, and Standard Operating 
Procedures to be followed by persons engaged in the protection system. 
37. 
 
The Amendment Act of 2022 introduced various amendments to 
the Women Protection Act of 2016 to align it with Section 6 of the Punjab 
Women Protection Authority Act 2017. These amendments make the PWPA 
directly responsible for the implementation of the 2016 Act as well. 
38. 
 
While the Social Welfare Department retains administrative 
control over the infrastructure, assets, and employees of Protection Centres 
and shelter homes notified under Section 13(6) of the Women Protection Act 
(as amended), this control is secondary to the PWPA‟s regulatory functions. 
The PWPA is empowered to issue SOPs, guidelines, and instructions to 
Protection Centres and shelter homes, which will take precedence over any 
conflicting SOPs or guidelines issued by the department. 
39. 
 
As adumbrated, the PWPA established a VAWC in District 
Multan in 2017 under the Women Protection Act. Once notified, the SOPs, 
guidelines, and regulations of the PWPA will also apply to this centre. 
Implementation status of the laws dealing with Protection Centres and 
shelter homes 
40. 
 
To ensure proper enforcement of women‟s fundamental rights, it 
is essential that the laws governing Protection Centres and shelter home 
facilities for women are implemented in both letter and spirit. According to 
the reports and para-wise comments submitted by the respondents, significant 
gaps exist in their implementation. 
A. 
The Punjab Protection of Women against Violence Act 2016 
41. 
 
Section 3 of the Women Protection Act mandates the 
Government to take several measures for its implementation, including 
establishing a universal toll-free number, setting up Protection Centres and 
shelter homes, appointing necessary staff, raising public awareness of the Act, 
and creating a database for monitoring and evaluation. However, 
implementation has been minimal. Since 2017, only one toll-free number and 
a single Protection Centre in Multan have been established, and staff 
appointments made solely in that place. Furthermore, there is no mechanism 
for sensitizing public officials, no data-based systems, and an overall lack of 
compliance with the law. 

Writ Petition No.10511/2020 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       16 
42. 
 
Section 11 requires the Government to establish a District 
Women Protection Committee in each district. However, only one committee 
has been notified in Multan, which operates without proper SOPs or 
guidelines. Section 13 mandates the establishment of Protection Centres, but 
only one new centre was set up in Multan. For all other districts of Punjab, 
existing government facilities such as Dar-ul-Amans and Shaheed Benazir 
Bhutto Human Rights Crisis Centres for Women were notified as shelter 
homes and Protection Centres, respectively. No serious endeavour was made 
to implement the law in its true letter and spirit. Instead, a stop-gap 
arrangement was put in place for quick enforcement of the law in Punjab by 
notifying existing shelter facilities and crisis centres as shelter homes and 
Protection Centres. 
43. 
 
Section 14(1) obligates the Government to appoint a District 
Women Protection Officer and Women Protection Officers for each district to 
perform the functions outlined in sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 14, 
respectively. However, appointments have only been made in Multan. In 
other districts, existing staff from different departments have been nominated 
to perform these functions without a proper structure or guidelines. Section 25 
requires the PWPA to conduct performance audits of the protection system 
periodically, but this is not done. Section 27 mandates regular training for 
protection officers and staff, but the respondents have not provided any 
details regarding this in their replies or during the hearing of these petitions. 
44. 
 
Section 28 mandates that the PWPA submit an annual report 
within three months of the end of the financial year to the Secretary, who will 
then present it to the Provincial Assembly of Punjab. This report should detail 
the services provided, rescue operations conducted, reasons for delays, 
performance audits, recommendations for reforms, and other matters 
specified in Section 28(2). However, the PWPA‟s annual reports have not 
fully covered all required aspects and data points. 
45. 
 
Section 29 requires the Government to make rules for carrying 
out the purposes of the Act. However, even after eight years, they have not 
been framed. According to the PWPA, it has submitted draft rules to the 
Government, but these are still awaiting approval.

       17 
B. 
The Punjab Women Protection Authority Act 2017 
46. 
 
Section 3 of the Punjab Women Protection Authority Act 2017 
mandates the Government to establish the PWPA to fulfill the Act‟s purposes. 
The position of Chairperson has remained vacant from December 2022 until 
recently, with no legal justification provided for the delay in appointment.25 
47. 
 
The PWPA‟s responsibilities inter alia include developing 
standards and issuing guidelines for the protection system. However, only 
draft SOPs for Protection Centres have been prepared. No SOPs have been 
established for shelter homes. Furthermore, although the PWPA is mandated 
to hold monthly meetings, these are not conducted regularly. 
48. 
 
Section 19 of the Act empowers the Government to conduct a 
performance audit of the PWPA, but no such audit has been conducted since 
its establishment. Section 20 of the Act requires the Director General to 
submit an annual performance report to the PWPA within three months of the 
end of each financial year. This report should detail all activities, 
developmental initiatives, achieved targets from the previous year, and future 
plans. The PWPA must then publish this report for public access and submit it 
to the Government, which in turn must present it to the Provincial Assembly 
of Punjab within ninety days. However, the annual reports for 2020/21 and 
2022/23 submitted to this Court primarily list events and training sessions 
held mainly in District Multan. For 2022/23, the report mentions a one-day 
training session for District Women Protection Officers and Women 
Protection Officers in only 14 districts, including Lahore, with no training for 
officers in other districts as required by law. These reports are not available 
on the PWPA website and appear not to have been submitted to the 
Government or the Provincial Assembly. 
49. 
 
Section 22 empowers the Government to make rules for carrying 
out the purposes of the Act by notification in the official Gazette. No rules 
have been drafted or notified by the Government. The PWPA is responsible 
for implementing and enforcing the Women Protection Act. In the absence of 
rules, its ability to evaluate and monitor effectively is significantly 
compromised.

50. 
 
Section 23 provides that, subject to the Act and the rules, the 
PWPA may frame regulations for matters not provided for in the Act or rules 
and for which provision is necessary or expedient for carrying out the 
purposes of the Act. Despite eight years since its establishment, the PWPA 
has not made any regulations. 
NCHR report 
51. 
 
Recently, the NCHR and U.N. Women, in collaboration with the 
Aurat Foundation, released a comprehensive report titled “More than Shelter: 
Needs Assessment of Dar ul Amans and Shelters in Pakistan.” This report 
examines the conditions of Dar-ul-Amans across Pakistan, including three 
districts in Punjab. Key findings from the report are as follows: 
(a) 
The physical infrastructure of shelter homes was lacking, with 
inadequate external environments and deficient security measures, such as 
missing jammers, security gates, and door viewers. Interior spaces, 
including rooms, kitchens, and bathrooms, were generally inadequate, while 
some shelters had no visitors‟ rooms, counseling rooms, or libraries. The 
study found fire safety to be unsatisfactory across all shelters. Chapter 4 of 
the NCHR Report further details the physical mapping results, revealing 
missing security systems and emergency exits in several Duas, with 
inadequate interior spaces and poor hygiene in toilets and bathrooms. 
(b) 
A significant issue highlighted was the vacancy in staff positions, 
with many shelters lacking essential personnel, such as psychologists, 
preventing regular counseling for residents. The report documented the 
overall gaps in services, including discrepancies between the availability 
and accessibility of medical and legal aid. Educational activities and social 
integration services were notably absent or insufficient in most Duas. 
(c) 
Challenges with the shelter environment were also evident, with a 
majority of residents not feeling safe. This was particularly pronounced in 
Peshawar and Rawalpindi, where all residents reported feeling unsafe. 
Psycho-social support was deemed unsatisfactory due to the absence of 
permanent or visiting psychologists, resulting in a lack of expert counseling 
and confidentiality concerns. 
(d) 
Legal aid services, a basic need for survivors of violence against 
women and girls, were often reported to be available only at the residents‟ 
cost. Free legal aid was rarely available, increasing the vulnerability of 
survivors. Complaint-handling mechanisms were largely absent, with no 
systemic processes in place, and residents often resolved issues amongst 
themselves without proper support. 
(e) 
A substantial portion of the budget allocated to Duas in Punjab was 
directed toward staff salaries, while the funds for survivors‟ daily meals 
were inadequate. No resources were earmarked for capacity-building or 
refresher training for shelter staff. 
52. 
 
The Punjab Commission on the Status of Women conducted an 
empirical survey of the 35 Dar-ul-Amans in Punjab, titled “The Sheltering 
Women from Harm: Dar-ul-Amans of Punjab - Achievements & Challenges 

Writ Petition No.10511/2020 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       19 
2016.”26 This survey highlighted gaps and challenges existing at the time of 
the study, some of which are similar to those noted in the NCHR Report. 
Existing oversight mechanisms (monitoring and evaluation system) for 
shelter homes and protection centres: 
53. 
 
Since no SOPs or Rules have been framed under the Women 
Protection Act, which is the governing law, the following guidelines for 
administration and functioning and oversight as developed by the Social 
Welfare Department are currently in the field for the regulation of the  
Dar-ul-Amans/shelter homes: 
(i) 
Guidelines 2015 for the Dar-ul-Amans in Punjab (Shelter Homes for 
Women in Distress).27 
(ii) 
Guidelines for the Protection of the Residents‟ Rights inside the 
Duas.28 
(iii) 
TORs for the Provision of Legal Aid Services in Dar-ul-Amans.29  
(iv) 
Complaints Management Committee TORs – as approved by Social 
Welfare Department in December 2014 to deal with Human Rights 
violations in Duas.30.31  
(v) 
Advisory Committees Notification and Functions, 201532.33  
54. 
 
District Judges periodically visit Dar-ul-Amans and children‟s 
homes and issue necessary directives. They conduct these inspections in 
compliance with an order issued by the Lahore High Court a couple of years 
back in a constitutional petition. The Social Welfare Department has filed 
some of the District Judges‟ inspection reports with their reply in this Court, 
which I have reviewed. In my opinion, while there is little doubt that the

31 The TORs of the Complaints Management Committees (CMC) stipulate that it shall consist of the SW 
District Officer, Dua In-charge, representatives of local NGOs, the chairperson of the Advisory Committee 
(or his/her representative), and a representative of the Dua residents. This body is supposed to address all 
complaints lodged at the Dua. Only 34% of Duas have active Complaints Management Committees.

https://pcsw.punjab.gov.pk/system/files/ShelteringWomenfromHarmDarulAmansofPunjabAchievementsand

operational.  
32 https://swd.punjab.gov.pk/system/files/policy%20instruction%20of%20advisory%20committee.pdf  
33 According to the Terms of Reference, the Advisory Committee comprises representatives of concerned 
departments such as police or education, the medical superintendent of the health department, a 
representative of the District Bar Association, prominent members of the local community involved in 
business and/or philanthropy, and the Dua In-Charge. Advisory Committees have multiple roles: They help 
mobilize additional funds through private donations as well as voluntary service providers from the public 
and private sectors; assist in monitoring adherence to the Guidelines and ensuring minimum standards of 
cleanliness, assist in arranging staff training. The Committee also has the authority to recommend the 
selection of women for admission to the shelter homes and to extend residents‟ stays. As of January 2023, 
Advisory Committees have also been denotified and are not functional.

District Judges‟ visits are beneficial, they are insufficient for comprehensive 
monitoring of Dar-ul-Amans.  
55. 
 
The Social Welfare Department‟s reply filed with this Court 
states that each Dar-ul-Aman submits a monthly progress report. However, no 
such reports were provided, and it is unclear to whom these reports are 
submitted and how they are evaluated. Additionally, the Department claims 
there is live monitoring of Dar-ul-Amans through a Management Information 
System, but no details were provided on the system‟s location, operation, or 
the type of oversight and monitoring it ensures. 
56. 
 
The Social Welfare Department‟s website claims that shelter 
homes operate under a systematic monitoring and evaluation framework 
managed by the Directorate General Social Welfare and Bait-ul-Maal. This 
framework reportedly includes an action planning cycle template, mid-term 
and final evaluations, monthly progress reports, resident statistics, health and 
hygiene forms, and service provider visit forms. However, during the hearing 
of these petitions, no data regarding these tools were submitted to the court 
record, and no evidence was presented of any mid-term or final evaluations or 
monthly progress reports. Simply listing these tools on the Department‟s 
website is inadequate; their actual implementation must be demonstrated. 
57. 
 
The situation regarding the monitoring and regulation of 
Protection Centres is equally disturbing. The Government has not framed or 
notified the SOPs or Rules under the Women Protection Act that are 
necessary to regulate them. Currently, only the Protection Centre in Multan, 
established under the Women Protection Act, is functioning under the 
supervision and guidance of the District Women Protection Committee for 
Multan, which provides some oversight and evaluation mechanisms for the 
centre. 
58. 
 
As discussed above, the Protection Centres include the Shaheed 
Benazir Bhutto Human Rights Crisis Centres for Women and certain Dar-ul-
Amans designated as such. The aforementioned Crisis Centres are currently 
regulated by SOPs developed by the Women Development Department at the 
federal level. Following the Eighteenth Constitutional Amendment and the 
subsequent devolution of these institutions to the provinces, the Social 
Welfare Department has not formulated new SOPs for their regulation. The 
NCHR Report also noted that “SBBWCCs are devolved to the provinces, but 

Writ Petition No.10511/2020 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       21 
their adoption remains challenging in terms of ownership and the 
promulgation of Rules. There are no Minimum Caring Standards for 
SBBWCCs to monitor the quality of services.”34 
59. 
 
Staff competency directly impacts service delivery, functioning, 
and oversight mechanisms at Protection Centres and shelter homes. The 
Women Protection Act stipulates that if District Women Protection Officers 
or Women Protection Officers have not been appointed, the Secretary may, by 
notification in the official Gazette and under specified terms and conditions, 
nominate any officer from the Social Welfare Department to perform their 
functions under the Act. Consequently, the Secretary has notified various 
appointments. Notably, neither the Dar-ul-Aman Guidelines 2015 nor any 
SOPs specify the eligibility requirements for staff appointments, particularly 
for the In-charges, superintendents, managers, and psychologists. This lack of 
defined criteria makes it difficult to assess whether these staff members are 
suitable to fulfill their responsibilities. The NCHR Report has also highlighted 
that the staff “showed a lack of understanding of gender, gender-based 
violence (GBV), shelter SOPs, and how to handle survivors with respect and 
dignity. There was also negligible awareness of pro-women laws ...”35 This 
gap in knowledge and skills underscores the need for clearly defined 
eligibility criteria and comprehensive training programmes to ensure that staff 
members are equipped to provide the necessary support and protection to 
women in these shelters. Without such measures, the effectiveness of 
Protection Centres and shelter homes remains significantly compromised. 
Need for the establishment of District Women Protection Committees to 
ensure monitoring and evaluation 
60. 
 
As mentioned earlier, Section 11 of the Women Protection Act 
mandates the Government to establish a District Women Protection 
Committee (“District Committee”) in each district. However, only one 
committee has been notified in Multan, which operates without proper SOPs 
or guidelines. District Committees play a crucial role in implementing the 
Act. According to Section 12, their responsibilities include supervising the 
Protection Centre, shelter home, and toll-free helpline and taking steps to

improve services. They must ensure the uninterrupted functioning of the toll-
free number and high-quality response at the Protection Centre, including 
arranging employee training. Additionally, the committees liaise with other 
departments and agencies to enhance the performance of the Protection 
Centre and shelter home, mediate and reconcile disputes under the Act, and 
ensure cases of violence are referred to the Protection Centre for medical 
examination and investigation. The District Committees also approve the 
annual plan of action for the Protection Centre and shelter home, address and 
solve problems faced by these institutions, and monitor and evaluate their 
work. They enlist women volunteers and organizations, assign roles to them, 
and suggest measures for better protection of women. Furthermore, the 
District Committees ensure minimum standards and SOPs for employees, 
approve the annual report on the protection system‟s performance for 
submission to the Government, and perform any other functions assigned by 
the PWPA related to the Act‟s objectives. In light of all this, a complete 
regulatory system cannot exist without duly notified District Protection 
Committees in all districts of Punjab. 
Regulation of privately run shelter homes 
61. 
 
In Punjab, private organizations such as Dastak, SOS, and Edhi 
Home provide shelter services, but there appears to be no government 
regulation of these facilities. The Additional Advocate General did not 
present any legislation or regulatory framework regarding them except the 
Voluntary Social Welfare Agencies (Registration and Control) Ordinance, 
1961, and the Charities Act, 2018, which provide for the registration of such 
organizations. 
62. 
 
The Government should introduce measures to ensure the proper 
regulation and smooth operation of privately run shelter homes after thorough 
consultation with these organizations. It should also enhance public-private 
partnerships to raise awareness of available shelter and protection services for 
women facing violence. Nevertheless, the Government must not abdicate its 
fundamental responsibility to provide shelter and protection for women who 
are victims of abuse by shifting it to private entities.

Issue of marriage of residents of shelter homes 
63. 
 
There are serious allegations of forced marriages of residents in 
some shelter homes. During the hearing of the present petitions, the Secretary 
Social Welfare Department stated that marriages of residents are conducted 
only with their consent and, where applicable, the permission of their 
guardians, plus the approval of the Advisory Committees notified by the 
Department. He mentioned that only one marriage has been arranged to date. 
The Terms of Reference (TORs) for these Advisory Committees, outlined in 
Notification No. SO(D) 2-3/2011 dated 09.10.2018,36 cover responsibilities 
such as managing operations, selecting beneficiaries, handling complaints, 
and overseeing rehabilitation programmes. There is no specific mandate for 
arranging marriages for residents. It cannot be assumed that this falls under 
the committee‟s rehabilitation duties. 
64. 
 
The only explicit reference to marriages is found in paragraph 
5.6 of Guidelines 2015 of the Social Welfare Department, which provides:37 
5.6 
The Dar-ul-Aman may, with the consent or on the request of a 
resident, arrange for a resident to be married. All marriages arranged by the 
Dar-ul-Aman shall be conducted by a Nikah Registrar in the presence of at 
least two witnesses. The consent and/or request of a resident to enter into 
marriage must be given in express terms and shall, in all cases, be 
evidenced in writing. 
65. 
 
Regarding Kashana (orphanages for girls), the “SOPs and Policy 
Guidelines to Run the Affairs of Kashana Institutions” (January 2020) state as 
follows:38 
10. 
Rehabilitation: 
a) 
... 
b) 
The incharge, with consultation of the advisory committee and prior 
approval of the Director General SW&BMD, may arrange marriages 
of inmates of 18 years and above.  
c) 
Such marriages shall be conducted with the free will and consent of 
the inmate and her legal guardian with support from an Advisory 
Body/Philanthropist. 
d) 
The girls age of 18 above may be referred to Dar-ul-Falah and other 
institutions. 
66. 
 
Evidently, the regulatory framework for conducting marriages of 
shelter home residents remains weak and inadequate. Proper oversight

mechanisms are needed to eliminate any chance of residents being forced into 
marriage, particularly orphan girls, and to ensure they are not placed in such 
situations. Forced marriage is a serious criminal offence under section 498B 
PPC, punishable by up to seven years of imprisonment and a fine of 
Rs.500,000/-. The functions of the Advisory Committee should explicitly 
include oversight of marriage arrangements. Specifically, for marriages of 
orphan girls residing in Kashanas and other children‟s homes managed by the 
Social Welfare Department, the Child Protection & Welfare Bureau should 
act as the oversight body to ensure a proper mechanism is in place, 
guaranteeing that marriages are conducted with the full and free consent of 
the residents.  
Legislative framework for the protection of children 
67. 
 
Article 141 of the Constitution stipulates that subject to the 
Constitution, Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) may make laws (including laws 
having extra-territorial operation) for the whole or any part of Pakistan, and a 
Provincial Assembly may make laws for the Province or any part thereof.  
68. 
 
The executive authority of provincial governments in Pakistan is 
defined by Articles 137, 138, and 139(3) of the Constitution. Article 137 
states that a province‟s executive authority, subject to the Constitution, 
extends to matters on which the Provincial Assembly has the power to 
legislate. However, in any matter where both the Federal Parliament and the 
Provincial Assembly have legislative powers, the executive authority of the 
Province shall be subject to and limited by the executive authority expressly 
conferred by the Constitution or federal law. Article 138 allows the Provincial 
Assembly to delegate functions to subordinate authorities based on the 
Provincial Government‟s recommendations. Article 139(3) mandates the 
Provincial Government to establish rules for the allocation and transaction of 
its business. The Punjab Government has framed the Rules of Business 2011 
under this mandate. These sub-constitutional rules solely pertain to the 
organization and regulation of the government‟s internal workings and do not 
equate to the legislative conferment of jurisdiction.39 The First Schedule lists 
the departments, while the Second Schedule details the distribution of 
business among them. The Social Welfare and Bait-ul-Maal Department and 
the Home Department are the key departments dealing with child protection

matters in Punjab. According to the Second Schedule of the Rules of 
Business, the Social Welfare Department is responsible for the “registration, 
technical assistance, and monitoring of social welfare agencies.” It also 
handles social protection, including institutional care, skill development, 
rehabilitation, and the “eradication of social evils” as envisioned in Article 37 
of the Constitution. These responsibilities largely govern the child protection 
mechanisms, although not specifically, but generally.  
Federal legislation governing the protection of children 
National Commission on the Rights of the Child Act 2017 
69. 
 
Parliament has enacted the National Commission on the Rights 
of the Child Act, 2017 (NCRC Act 2017) to establish the National 
Commission on the Rights of Child (NCRC) to discharge its obligations 
under the UNCRC. The Commission‟s functions, as outlined in Section 15 of 
the Act, include examining and recommending changes to legislation and 
administrative proposals related to child rights; liaising with provincial 
commissions and organizations; reviewing and recommending measures for 
effective implementation of laws and policies protecting child rights; 
reporting on the effectiveness of such laws and policies; inquiring into 
violations of child rights and recommending actions; examining factors 
inhibiting child rights enjoyment such as violence and exploitation; 
sponsoring research and maintaining a database on child issues; spreading 
awareness and promoting dialogue on child rights; reviewing existing policies 
and programmes on child rights in light of international instruments and make 
recommendations for their effective implementation; calling for information 
from government bodies and civil society organizations with powers akin to a 
civil court pertaining to complaints of child rights violations; and undertaking 
additional functions as assigned by the Prime Minister or concerned division 
for the promotion and protection of child rights. 
70. 
 
Before the establishment of the National Commission on the 
Rights of the Child under the NCRA Act 2017, the National Commission for 
Child Welfare and Development (NCCWD) was established by the 
Government through a resolution on 16th December 1979, effective from 1st 
January 1980. This resolution was amended over time, with the last 
amendment in 1991, placing the NCCWD under the Ministry of Health and 

Writ Petition No.10511/2020 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       26 
Social Welfare as an advisory body to the Government of Pakistan on matters 
related to children. After the devolution of the Ministry of Social Welfare and 
Special Education, the NCCWD was transferred to the Capital Administration 
& Development Division to function at the ICT level. It was later placed 
under the Ministry of Human Rights with the Prime Minister‟s approval, 
effective 2nd December 2011. Currently, it operates under the Ministry of 
Human Rights. The NCCWD is responsible for coordinating, monitoring, and 
facilitating the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the 
Rights of the Child (UNCRC) and other national and international 
obligations. It also submits mandatory periodic reports on the implementation 
of the UNCRC to the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child in Geneva 
and other relevant bodies.40  
71. 
 
The NCRC is an independent statutory body, while the NCCWD 
operates under the Ministry of Human Rights at the federal level. They 
function in parallel but complement each other. The NCRC acts as an 
oversight body, responsible for investigating child rights violations and 
holding the government accountable for its obligations toward children. In 
contrast, the NCCWD focuses on policy coordination and programme 
implementation, particularly at the international level, including the 
submission of mandatory periodic reports on the implementation of the 
UNCRC. 
Provincial legislation for the protection of children 
72. 
 
In the context of the provinces, specifically the Punjab, the 
following statutes enacted by the provincial legislature play a crucial role in 
establishing and administering shelter homes and Protection Centres for 
children: 
i) 
Punjab Government Rules of Business, 2011 (the “Rules of 
Business”). 
ii) 
Punjab Vagrancy Ordinance, 1958 (the “Vagrancy Ordinance”);  
iii) 
Voluntary Social Welfare Agencies (Registration and Control) 
Ordinance, 
1961 
(the 
“SWA 
Registration 
and 
Control 
Ordinance”); and 
iv) 
Punjab Destitute and Neglected Children Act, 2004 (the “PNDC 
Act of 2004”) along with the Punjab Destitute and Neglected 
Children (Registration of Organizations Managing Accommodation) 
Rules, 2019 (the “PNDC 2019 Rules”) made thereunder.

Writ Petition No.10511/2020 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       27 
73. 
 
I have already discussed that, as per the Second Schedule to the 
Rules of Business, the Social Welfare Department is responsible for the 
registration, technical assistance, and monitoring of social welfare agencies. 
Additionally, the Department handles social protection, including institutional 
care, skill development, rehabilitation, and the eradication of social evils. 
Under the Social Welfare Department, the Bait-ul-Maal Wing oversees the 
administration of the Punjab Vagrancy Ordinance, 1958, and the Voluntary 
Social Welfare Agencies (Registration & Control) Ordinance, 1961. Both 
statutes involve establishing and administering welfare homes and agencies 
for children, creating an overlap in jurisdiction.  
74. 
 
The Vagrancy Ordinance defines a child as a person under 
fourteen and includes provisions for their protection. It establishes welfare 
homes for vagrants, including children, and allows children without a 
livelihood to gain voluntary admission to these homes. The administration of 
the Vagrancy Ordinance falls under both the Social Welfare Department and 
the Home Department, according to the Rules of Business. 
75. 
 
The Home Department also administers the Punjab Destitute and 
Neglected Children Act 2004 (PDNC Act), which protects children under 
eighteen. The PDNC Act aligns with Pakistan‟s obligations under the 
UNCRC to protect neglected children through legislation and administrative 
reforms. The Act establishes the Child Protection and Welfare Bureau 
(CPWB), an autonomous body under the Home Department, responsible for 
managing and regulating child protection institutions. The CPWB‟s powers 
include establishing and recognizing child protection institutions, overseeing 
their operations, and ensuring the well-being of destitute and neglected 
children. 
76. 
 
Both the Social Welfare and Home Departments play crucial 
roles in child protection. However, their overlapping jurisdictions in certain 
areas lead to inefficiencies in fulfilling the State‟s responsibilities toward 
children. Notably, Under the PDNC Act, the CPWB and its administered 
Child Protection Institutions serve “destitute and neglected children” up to the  
 

Writ Petition No.10511/2020 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       28 
age of eighteen, covering both boys and girls.41 The CPWB is responsible for 
establishing, recognizing, registering, and maintaining Child Protection 
Institutions and non-governmental organizations that provide rehabilitation 
and accommodation services for these children. However, the CPWB‟s role 
overlaps with that of the Registration Authority under the SWA Registration 
and Control Ordinance, administered by the Social Welfare Department. The 
latter is responsible for registering and overseeing voluntary social welfare 
organizations, including those involved in childcare. Consequently, both the 
CPWB and the Social Welfare Department perform similar functions and 
have identical mandates in registering and overseeing non-governmental 
organizations related to childcare, leading to duplication of efforts in these 
roles. 
77. 
 
Besides 
the 
overlap 
in 
overseeing 
non-governmental 
organizations, the operation of Kashana Homes, which derives authority 
directly from the Rules of Business without any enabling legislation, leads to 
potential arbitrariness in the administration of alternative care for children. 
This situation raises the question of whether the Social Welfare Department 
possesses inherent executive authority to manage and regulate the Kashana 
Homes. According to the jurisprudence developed in our country, the answer 
is negative. In Mehran Security Services (Pvt.) Limited vs. Pakistan  
(2000 YLR 2655), the Sindh High Court held: 
“16. 
Since this matter has not been taken very seriously on behalf of the 
respondents, it has not been specifically contended that the said decision 
was made on the authority of Rules of Business, 1973 of the Federal 
Government, but it seems that the decision was made on the assumption that 
                                         
41 As per the definitions under Section 3(1)(k) of the PDNC 2004 Act read with Section 3(1)(e), a “destitute 
and neglected child” means a child under the age of eighteen, who –  
i) 
is found begging; or 
ii) 
is found without having any home or settled place of abode and without any ostensible 
means of subsistence; or 
iii) 
has a parent or guardian who is unfit or incapacitated to exercise control over the child; or 
iv) 
lives in brothel or with a prostitute or frequently visits any place being used for the purpose 
of prostitution or is found to associate with any prostitute or any other person who leads an 
immoral or depraved life; or 
v) 
is being or is likely to be abused or exploited for immoral or illegal purpose or 
unconscionable gain; or 
vi) 
is beyond the parental control; or  
vii) 
has lost his parents or one of the parents and has no adequate source of income; or 
viii) 
is victim of an offence punishable under this Act or any other law for the time being in 
force and his parent or guardian is convicted or accused for the commission of such 
offence; or 
ix) 
is at risk owing to disability or child labour; or  
x) 
is imprisoned with the mother or is born in a jail; or 
xi) 
is abandoned by the parents or guardian. 

Writ Petition No.10511/2020 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       29 
said Rules of Business empower the Ministry to take this decision. These 
Rules have been treated under Article 99 of the Constitution, and the Article 
itself clearly states that they shall he „for the allocation and transaction of 
the business of the Federal Government‟ of course, these Rules have a 
higher status than or ordinary delegated legislation, because they have been 
made on the authority of the Constitution itself, but they cannot substitute 
an Act of Parliament or Law to determine or affect the rights and duties of 
the citizens. Where a law assigns a function or confers a power on the 
Federal Government, the Rules of Business merely prescribe as to which of 
the Ministries or Divisions shall perform those functions and exercise those 
powers, and in what manner. These Rules cannot, therefore, be used to lay 
down the limitations, requirements, and mode, as in this case, which can 
only be done by enactment. In the case of M/s Murree Brewery Co. Ltd. v. 
D.G. Excise and Taxation and others (1991 MLD 267 (Lahore)) also, a 
view was expressed that the licensing system contemplated in Article 18 of 
the Constitution should be under some law.” 
(emphasis added) 
78. 
 
The above discussion shows that the Social Welfare Department 
cannot operate Kashana Homes without specific legislation. It should also be 
noted that, according to Section 20 of the PDNC Act, the CPWB is authorized 
to recognize, register, and oversee only organizations managed by either local 
governments or non-governmental organizations. Hence, it cannot control or 
oversee the Social Welfare Department, a government entity, or the Kashana 
Homes. 
Conclusion 
79. 
 
The writ petitioners have raised valid concerns regarding the 
functioning of Protection Centres and Dar-ul-Amans (shelter homes) in 
Punjab and the safety and well-being of the residents. These concerns are 
substantiated by reports from the Chief Minister‟s Inspection Team (CMIT), 
the National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR), and an empirical 
survey by the Punjab Commission on the Status of Women titled “The 
Sheltering Women from Harm: Dar-ul-Amans of Punjab – Achievements & 
Challenges 2016.” 
80. 
 
Issues in Protection Centres and Dar-ul-Amans have arisen due 
to a lack of uniform policies and standards across these institutions and the 
absence of proper monitoring and oversight. The Punjab Government heavily 
relies on the Rules of Business 2011 to regulate these institutions, but these 
rules do not provide a robust legal framework, leading to inconsistencies and 
administrative confusion. Although the Women Protection Act (2016) and the 
Punjab Women Protection Authority Act (2017) offer some legislative 
support, their implementation has been inadequate. Additionally, the 

Writ Petition No.10511/2020 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       30 
jurisdictional overlap between the Social Welfare and Home Departments 
complicates the effective administration of child protection services. 
81. 
 
The reliance on Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and 
guidelines rather than formal regulations under relevant laws is disturbing 
where the statutory powers granted to supervising and implementing 
authorities. For example, the Child Protection & Welfare Bureau, empowered 
by Section 50 of the PDNC Act, has not utilized its authority to frame 
regulations, leading to the continued use of SOPs and guidelines as the 
primary regulatory mechanism. This trend extends to other sectors, such as 
the Social Welfare Department‟s regulation of Dar-ul-Amans/Dar-ul-Falahs 
and the Punjab Women Protection Authority‟s reliance on draft SOPs for 
Protection Centres. 
82. 
 
Regulations provide a stronger and more authoritative 
framework than SOPs or guidelines. They are embedded in the legal system, 
which gives them a level of legitimacy and enforceability that SOPs and 
guidelines lack. This legal backing is crucial for ensuring compliance, as 
regulations can impose penalties for non-compliance, fostering a culture of 
adherence to established rules and standards. SOPs and guidelines, while 
helpful in providing detailed operational instructions and standards, do not 
carry the same legal weight as regulations. They are often seen as internal 
documents that may not be subject to the same level of scrutiny or 
enforcement. As a result, reliance on SOPs and guidelines without the 
backing of formal regulations can undermine the robustness and effectiveness 
of the regulatory framework. 
83. 
 
In the context of Punjab, the continued reliance on SOPs and 
guidelines despite the statutory authority to frame regulations suggests a 
missed opportunity to strengthen governance and accountability. Authorities 
should prioritize developing and implementing formal regulations to provide 
a clear legal foundation for their actions. This would not only enhance the 
legitimacy and authority of the regulatory framework but also ensure that 
there are clear legal consequences for non-compliance, ultimately leading to 
better governance and protection of vulnerable populations. 
84. 
 
The issue of forced marriages and abuse within shelter homes 
remains critical. The current regulatory framework for conducting marriages 
is weak, necessitating stricter oversight mechanisms to prevent any form of 

Writ Petition No.10511/2020 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       31 
coercion or abuse, especially for orphan girls. The State‟s obligations under 
international conventions like the UNCRC and the CEDAW emphasize the 
need for a robust legal and administrative framework to protect vulnerable 
women and children. However, the provincial implementation of these 
commitments has been lacking. 
85. 
 
There is an urgent need for comprehensive legislative reforms, 
clear operational guidelines, improved oversight mechanisms, and enhanced 
support services are essential to ensure the safety and well-being of residents 
in these institutions. Addressing these issues requires a coordinated effort 
from the relevant authorities to uphold the fundamental rights of vulnerable 
women and children. 
Directions of the Court 
86. 
 
Article 199(1)(a)(i) of the Constitution empowers this Court to 
command a person performing, within its territorial jurisdiction, functions in 
connection with affairs of a federation, a province, or a local authority, to do 
anything he is required by law to do. However, it is well-established that 
courts cannot issue a writ or direction to the legislature to enact a law. 
Nonetheless, in Sharaf Faridi and others v. The Federation of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan and another (PLD 1989 Karachi 404), a seven-member 
Bench of the Sindh High Court held that, in exceptional circumstances, the 
High Court may direct the Federal and/or Provincial Government to initiate 
legislative measures. The Court reasoned that there is a marked distinction 
between a directive to the legislature to legislate and a directive to the 
Executive to initiate legislative measures. This view was upheld by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in Al-Jehad Trust through Habibul Wahab Al-
Khairi Advocate and others v. Federation of Pakistan and others  
(1999 SCMR 1379) and reiterated in Province of Sindh and others v. 
M.Q.M. through Deputy Convener and others (PLD 2014 SC 531). 
Following these precedents, the High Courts in our country have, in several 
cases, directed the Government to take steps toward enacting a law or 
amending an existing one.42

others (PLD 2018 Lahore 1), Subay Khan v. Federation of Pakistan and others (PLJ 2018 Lahore 224), and 
Mian Muhammad Asif v. Superintendent of Police and others (PLD 2020 Lahore 137).

Doctrine of Continuing Mandamus 
88.  
 
The writ of mandamus dates back to ancient times. However, the 
doctrine of continuing mandamus is a modern innovation. Continuing 
mandamus, also referred to as structural interdict or structural injunction, 
consists of a series of orders issued by a court of law over an extended period 
directing an authority to perform its statutory functions or duties. The court 
does not dispose of the case but keeps it pending to supervise the performance 
of the duty and execution of the mandate. This approach is used in situations 
that cannot be resolved quickly and require a solution over a long time –

       34 
sometimes even years.43 A scholar discussed the efficacy of this doctrine as 
follows: 
“The doctrine of continuing mandamus serves several functions especially 
in a case where the executive does not carry out its functions effectively and 
either does not implement a statutory function or duty, or does not exercise 
its discretion wisely. The judiciary has been seen as an effective tool by the 
citizens to enforce the law and uphold justice when the executive has not 
done that. The remedy is often considered useful especially in the case of 
children‟s rights which the executive has continuously failed to implement. 
Thus, the only remedy left for the rights of children is the PIL. … [and] the 
court can use its powers under continuing mandamus to address this 
issue.”44 
89. 
 
Courts in various jurisdictions have effectively applied the 
doctrine of continuing mandamus. In Canada, the case of Doucet-Boudreau 
v. Nova Scotia (Minster of Education) [2003] 3. S.C.R. 3, (2003 SCC 62), 
involved minority language education rights. The Court retained supervisory 
jurisdiction to ensure the province‟s compliance, requiring periodic status 
reports. In the Philippines, in Metro Manila Development Authority v. 
Concerned Residents of Manila Bay [574 SCRA 661 (2008)], the Supreme 
Court issued a writ of continuing mandamus to compel the government to 
clean up, rehabilitate and preserve the Manila Bay.  
90. 
 
In India, the Supreme Court first used this approach in Bandhua 
Mukti Morcha v. Union of India and others [(1984) 3 SCC 161 :  
AIR 1984 SC 802], which concerned the plight of labourers, gross violations 
of fundamental rights, bonded labour and inhumane working and living 
conditions, with no access to necessities like clean water. The Court 
intervened by issuing wide-ranging remedial orders, encompassing twenty-
one directives to the state government. In Sheela Barse v. Union of India and 
others (AIR 1988 SC 2211), a PIL concerning violations of constitutional and 
statutory rights of children in custodial restraints, the Supreme Court of India 
gave numerous directions to different state governments, prison authorities, 
State Legal Aid Board, and made several recommendations to the legislature 
to enact a central legislation. Justifying its monitoring, the Court noted: 
“Indeed as the relief is positive and implies affirmative action, the decision 
are not „one-shot‟ determinations but have on-going implications. Remedy is 
both imposed, negotiated or quasi-negotiated. Therefore, what corresponds to

the stage of final disposal in an ordinary litigation is only a stage in the 
proceedings.”

However, it was Vineet Narain and others v. Union of India 
and another (AIR 1998 SC 889), where the Supreme Court coined the 
medium of continuing mandamus. The Court monitored the investigation of 
the case to ensure that the authorities abide by its directions. It held that  
“the medium of „continuing mandamus‟ was a new tool forged because of the 
peculiar needs of this matter.” Thereafter, the Indian courts have applied 
continuing mandamus in numerous cases to achieve long-term enforcement of 
their orders.45 
92. 
 
In Pakistan, the Supreme Court issued directions analogous to 
the nature of continuing mandamus in many cases, such as The Bank of 
Punjab and another v. Haris Steel Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. and others  
(PLD 2010 SC 1109), without specifying that it was following the doctrine. 
However, in Asghar Leghari v. Federation of Pakistan and others  
(PLD 2018 Lahore 364), a learned judge of this Court specifically mentioned 
the principle of continuing mandamus and stated that he was following it. 
After that, this doctrine was pressed into service in various cases.46  
93. 
 
The above discussion shows that the doctrine of continuing 
mandamus, practised in other countries, is also integrated into our legal 
system. Given the unique circumstances of these cases, I will not dispose of 
these petitions and, instead, direct the office to schedule them for a hearing 
before any available Bench in the fourth week of May 2025. The Chief 
Secretary, Government of the Punjab, shall submit a progress report to this 
Court on that date.
