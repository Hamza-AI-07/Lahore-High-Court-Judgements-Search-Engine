Mr. Affan Alam Chaudhary, Advocate for the 
petitioners. 
 
 
This Civil Revision, filed under Section 115 of the 
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, is directed against the 
judgment and decree of learned appellant Court, 
whereby, the appeal preferred by respondents was 
allowed and resultantly dismissed the petitioners’ suit for 
declaration with permanent injunction.  
2. 
 
Facts in brevity are that the petitioners/ 
plaintiffs (hereinafter referred to as ‘plaintiffs’) instituted a 
suit for declaration with permanent injunction on 
25.02.1996 against the respondents/defendants (hereinafter 
referred to as ‘defendants’), on the grounds that the 
plaintiffs and defendant No.1 are real brothers; that suit 
property measuring 98 kanals 08 marlas situated in 
khewat No.4 khatoni No.79 Chak No.6/4-L, Tehsil Okara 
(hereinafter referred to as “the suit property”) was owned 
by the Provincial Government; that their father was in 
cultivating possession of the same as a tenant since 1956-
57 till his death; that after the demise of their father, all 
the four brothers jointly cultivated the suit property as 
tenants; that defendant No.1 with the help and 
connivance of revenue officials got entered his name as a 
tenant in the crops Kharif 1971 and Rabi 1972; that in the 
year 1974 the Provincial Government launched a scheme 
to grant proprietary rights to the cultivators who were in 
possession of the property; that the plaintiffs and 

C.R. No.68828 of 2023.                                                      -2- 
 
 
 
defendant No.1 applied to get the proprietary rights and 
also paid the expenses; that after completion of legal 
proceedings defendant No.1 assured the plaintiffs that 
proprietary rights have been granted to all the four 
brothers but in the year 1995 the plaintiffs came to know 
that defendant No.1 has got proprietary rights of the suit 
property in his name vide order dated 15.07.1974 passed 
by the Deputy Land Commissioner followed by mutation 
No.317 dated 25.04.1989; that defendant No.1 in 
connivance with the revenue staff fraudulently obtained 
the order dated 15.07.1974 from Deputy Land 
commissioner; that the suit property had been in their 
possession being legal heirs of Ghulam Muhammad, 
therefore, the impugned order wherein the suit property 
was allotted only to defendant No.1 excluding the 
plaintiffs, is illegal, against facts and law having no effect 
upon their rights and sought declaration that being legal 
heirs the plaintiffs and defendant No.1 are owners of the 
suit property according to their legal share. Defendant 
No.1 and defendants No.2 & 3 resisted the suit through 
separate contested written statements wherein while 
raising certain preliminary objections defended the 
impugned order and refuted all the allegations/averments 
made in the plaint. Defendant No.1 in his written 
statement maintained that he was in possession of the suit 
property as a tenant from Kharif 1971 to Rabi 1971-72, 
hence, the suit property was allotted to him by the 
Deputy Land Commissioner vide order dated 15.07.1974 
after observing all formalities in accordance with law; 
that earlier the suit property was owned by Anjuman 
Ahmadia Ishaat Islam Trust which was resumed by the 
Land Commission and the same was allotted to him as he 
was in possession of the suit property as tenant at the 
relevant time; that the plaintiffs were not in possession of 
the suit property, therefore, they have no concern with 

C.R. No.68828 of 2023.                                                      -3- 
 
 
 
the suit property. The learned trial Court, out of divergent 
pleadings of the parties, framed necessary issues on 
10.09.1996, subsequently fresh issues were framed and 
invited them to produce their respective evidence and 
after recording evidence of the parties pro and contra, 
oral as well as documentary decreed the suit vide 
judgment and decree dated 30.09.2022. Being aggrieved, 
the legal heirs of defendant No.1 preferred an appeal 
which was allowed by the learned appellate court vide 
judgment and decree dated 31.07.2023. Being dis-
satisfied the plaintiffs approached this Court through 
instant Civil Revision.  
3. 
 
I 
have 
heard 
preliminary 
arguments 
advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioners and 
perused the record with his able assistance. 
4. 
 
The plaintiffs basically assailed the vires of 
order dated 15.07.1974 passed by the Deputy Land 
Commissioner followed by mutation No.317 dated 
25.04.1989 whereby, resumed suit property, consisting 
upon 98 kanals 08 marlas, from Anjuman Ahmadia 
Ishaat Islam Trust was allotted to Ghulam Ali (defendant 
No.1) on the grounds that after the demise of their 
predecessor namely Ghulam Muhammad (father of the 
plaintiffs and defendant No.1) who was original tenant of 
the Trust, the suit property had been in their joint 
possession being his legal heirs, therefore, the impugned 
order wherein the suit property was only allotted to 
defendant No.1 excluding the plaintiffs, other sons of 
Ghulam Muhammad, is illegal, against facts and law 
having no effect upon their rights and sought declaration 
that being legal heirs plaintiffs and defendant No.1 are 
joint owners of the suit property according to their legal 
share. Whereas, the stance of the defendant No.1 is that 
he was in possession of the suit property during crucial 
harvest i.e Kharif 1971 to Rabi 1971-72 and being land 

C.R. No.68828 of 2023.                                                      -4- 
 
 
 
less tenant he applied for allotment of the resumed land 
(suit property) through adopting proper procedure and 
after scrutinized his claim, the suit property was allotted 
to him. 
5. 
      Before discussing further it is better to see the 
law 
and 
rules 
applicable 
for 
allotment 
of 
resumed/surrendered land. 
6. 
      The land resumed or surrendered under 
paragraph No.13 & 14 of the Land Reforms Regulation, 
1972 (Martial Law Regulation No.115 of 1972) 
(hereinafter referred to as “MLR.115 of 1972”) is settled to

tenant fails to provide the required information or 
willfully furnishes incomplete or false declaration shall 
liable to action under paragraph 30 of MLR-115 of 1972 
which provides rigorous imprisonment for a term which 

C.R. No.68828 of 2023.                                                      -8- 
 
 
 
may extend to 07 years in addition to forfeiture of all or 
part of his immovable property to Government. 
From LR-XI should be submitted personally or 
through 
authorized 
agent 
to 
the 
Deputy 
Land 
Commissioner of the district, where the surrendered and 
resumed land in the cultivating possession of the 
applicant is situate 
          In case the applicant is illiterate, should affix his 
thumb impression while furnishing the certificate at the 
end of the Form, which should be attested by a literate 
person. 
 
 It was also directed that statement LR-XIV 
showing the name and full particulars of the tenants in 
cultivating possession during the harvests and statement 
LR-XV showing the particulars of land that was not in 
cultivating possession of a tenant are to be prepared. 
These statements are to be verified and certified 
personally by the Revenue Officer of the Haqla, and the 
Assistant Commissioner. Not less than 25% of the entries 
in the statements are to be checked personally by the 
Deputy Land Commissioner to ensure that mistakes have 
not been incorporated  in the statements. 
           In order to safeguard against any possibility of 
names of genuine cultivating tenants being excluded and 
names of undeserving tenants not qualified for allotment 
being included, it has, further been directed that the 
statement LR-XIV and LR-XV should be verified and 
certified personally by the Revenue Officer of the Halqa 
and the Assistant Commissioner concerned in the 
revenue estate itself in a ‘Jalsa-e-Aam’. Before this 
verification seven days advance notice should be given to 
the villagers that an inquiry is to who were in cultivating 
possession of the resumed land during Kharif 1971` and 
Rabi 1971-72 would be made by the Revenue 
Officer/Assistant Commissioner on the date to be 

C.R. No.68828 of 2023.                                                      -9- 
 
 
 
indicated in the notice and that objections would be 
invited from person disputing the entitlement of the 
tenants claiming allotment. 
 
 To answer a question with regard to “joint 
tenancies”, through Letter No.DSL-1186072/6227-LC(II) 
dated 27.11.1972 observed that a question has also arisen 
whether in case of joint tenancies the tenants should be 
allotted the land jointly or individually. According to the 
provisions of paragraph 18(1) and (2), the land resumed 
is to be granted free of charges to the tenants who are 
shown in the revenue records to be in cultivating 
possession of it in Kharif 1971 and Rabi 1971-72 and 
declared that the names of all the tenants should be 
shown together in the allotment order along with their 
respective shares. 
10. 
 
From careful study of paragraph 18(1) and 
(2) of the MLR-115 of 1972, the rules framed thereunder, 
Statement of Terms and Condition, the Notifications and 
Instructions issued through letters from time to time, it 
appears that a special procedure was prescribed for grant 
of resumed/surrender land free of cost to the landless 
tenants. The tenant who required such grant had to apply 
through application duly verified and supported by a 
declaration given in the Form No.LR-XI. Said Form 
should be accompanied a certificate that the information 
is accurate and complete in all respects. If tenant fails to 
provide the required information or willfully furnishes 
incomplete or false declaration then he was liable to 
action under paragraph 30 of MLR-115 of 1972. It was 
also Standing Instructions to the concerned Patwari to 
provide information through preparing Statement LR-
XIV showing the names and full particulars of the tenants 
in cultivating possession during the harvest and through 
statement LR-XV showing particulars of land which was 
not in cultivating possession of a tenant. Said statements 

C.R. No.68828 of 2023.                                                      -10- 
 
 
 
were required to be verified by the concerned Revenue 
Officer and the Assistant Commissioner. Through an 
inquiry in a Jalsa-e-Aam held in the concerned estates by 
giving notices to the villagers that an inquiry as to who 
were in cultivating possession of the resumed land during 
Kharif 1971 and Rabi 1971-72 and inviting the 
objections from persons disputing the entitlement of the 
tenant claiming allotment scrutinized the claim of a 
tenant. In case of any dispute to ascertain the actual 
cultivating possession, then Canal Girdwari and Khatoni 
can also be checked and compared for verification. The 
Revenue Officer was also bound to ensure that the entries 
in LR-XVI and LR-XVII were fully corroborated with 
the entries in the Khasra Girdwari for the relevant 
period. In case of joint tenancies, the resumed land was 
to be allotted in the names of all the tenants according to 
their shares. It was not necessary that the tenant was 
actually cultivating the land. If he was shown cultivating 
possession in the revenue record then he was entitled for 
allotment. Right of appeal, revision and review was also 
available to the aggrieved party. 
11. 
    When case of the plaintiffs is examined in the 
light of procedure for allotment as discussed above, it is 
found that neither they applied for allotment through 
submitting application supported by declaration Form 
LR-XI nor raised any objections at the relevant time with 
regard to wrong entries of Khasra Girdwari in the name 
of defendant No.1. Their stance that they are in joint 
cultivating possession of the suit property is not verified 
from the Khasra Girdwari. If there were joint tenancies 
then the suit property should have been allotted to all of 
them according to the shares in their possession. The 
criteria for grant of resumed land under para 18(1) is not 
actual cultivation but cultivating possession of the land 
shown in the revenue records for Kharif 1971 and Rabi 

C.R. No.68828 of 2023.                                                      -11- 
 
 
 
1971-72 is enough for allotment. A tenant in cultivating 
possession of resumed land during these two harvests 
would be entitled to its allotment even though it may not 
have actually been cultivated during these harvests. But 
plaintiffs failed to prove that they were in cultivating 
possession in the revenue records for Kharif 1971 and 
Rabi 1971-72. 
12. 
  The plaintiffs’ allegation that defendant No.1 
manipulated the Register Girdwari by interpolating his 
name in the crucial crops with the help and connivance of 
the revenue officials is concerned, it is suffice to say that 
a procedure for preparing the Register Girdawri is 
prescribed in the Land Revenue Rules, 1968 and in 
Chapter 9 of the Land Record Manual. 
 
Rule 39 of the Land Revenue Rules, 1968 
describes that for each estate a crop inspection register 
(Girdawari)  shall be maintained, in Form XXIV and 
similarly for each estate a register of changes in 
cultivation, possession and rent to be known as the 
“Register Taghayyurat-e-Kasht” shall also be maintained 
by the Patwari in Form XXIV-A in which he will enter 
such harvest-wise changes as are not disputed and will 
incorporate the same in the “Register Girdawari” after 
due checking and attestation thereof by the Field 
Kannugo and the Circle Revenue Officer. The inspection 
of each harvest shall commence, as follow:- 
 
Kharif 
 
 
1St October 
Rabi  
 
 
1st March 
The crops will be entered in the  Register Girdawari as 
the inspection proceeds. The changes in rights, rents and 
possession will be noted in the appropriate column. To 
prevent any error, the Patwari enter his diary a list of all 
field numbers in which any change of cultivating 
occupying or rent has occurred and place this list before 
the field Kannugo at his next visit for verification. 

C.R. No.68828 of 2023.                                                      -12- 
 
 
 
Similarly in the Register Taghayyurat-e-Kasht he will 
enter harvest-wise all changes of cultivating possession, 
rent, etc. which are undisputed. Whenever a Patwari has 
to alter an entry once made in the Register Girdawari, he 
must enter it in his diary but no such alteration should be 
made after the ‘Dhal Bachh’ of the harvest have been 
drawn up or corrected except with the sanction of the 
Collector which may be given for the correction of 
clerical or patent mistakes only. The field Kannugo is 
bound to inspect the Patwari’s diary and he should check 
the alterations which have been made in the Register very 
carefully. Said entries of Register Girdawari would be 
enter in the Register Haqdarana Zamin. If at the time of 
preparation of the Register Haqdaran Zamin an entry in 
the Register Girdawari is found to be incorrect, it will 
nevertheless be retained unaltered, but the correct entry 
will be noted in red ink and will be attested by the 
Kannugo.  
            The Patwari will bring ther Register Haqdaran 
Zamin to the Tehsil at the beginning of September 
alongwith Register Girdawari, work books consisting of 
counterfoils and notes of inspection in his possession that 
are more than twelve years old. These papers except 
Register Haqdaran Zamin will be destroyed at once by 
the office Kannugo ((Para No.3.99 of Land Record 
Manual). 
 
  A proper procedure is provided for maintaining 
and preparing the Register Girdawari. The concerned 
Patwari is bound to enter the Girdawari after inspection. 
Any change in the existing Girdawari is also entered in a 
separate Register and duly verified. Said entries of 
Register Girdawari are entered in the Register Haqdaran 
Zamin and after preparation of the Register Haqdarana 
Zamin, the Register Girdawari will be destroyed after 
twelve years. The plaintiffs challenged the entries of 

C.R. No.68828 of 2023.                                                      -13- 
 
 
 
Register Girdawari of the years 1971-72 through 
instituting the suit in the year 1996. The plaintiffs 
challenged said entries after 25 years when the relevant 
record had already been destroyed.  
13. 
      From scanning of evidence, it appears that 
initially plaintiffs produced Anwar Masih as PW-1, 
Muhammad Din as PW-2 and Muhammad Ibrahim as 
PW-3. Said witnesses during cross-examination admitted 
that property was allotted to whom in whose name 
girdwari had existed. PW-2 admitted it correct that 
management of Anjuman Ahmadia used to live in their 
village and tenancy was settled through its Manager. He 
further deposed that his father also got the tenancy from 
the said Manager and admitted it correct that office of the 
Anjuman situated in their village. He also admitted that 
suit property was allotted by Deputy Commissioner in an 
open assembly. After settlement of fresh issues, the 
petitioners produced Muhammad Anwar from the office 
of Kanungo as PW-1. He brought himself record of 
mutation 
No.317 
and 
during 
cross-examination 
maintained that in the column of ownership name of 
Provincial Government through Land Commissioner 
Lahore is existed and in the column of cultivation name 
of Ghulam Ali is incorporated. One of the plaintiffs, 
namely, Ashiq Ali got recorded his statement as PW-2 on 
29.08.2002. He narrated the same facts as pleaded in the 
plaint. He deposed that his father was died in the year 
1968. He maintained that defendant No.1 got entered the 
property in his name which was not in their knowledge. 
Muhammad Ibrahim again got recorded his statement as 
PW-3 on 29.08.2002.  During cross-examination he 
deposed that he was present at the time of allotment. 
Further deposed that Deputy Commissioner and Assistant

the time of allotment all the brothers were present. He 
deposed that the property which was in the name of his 
father was allotted to him and thereafter inherited to all 
legal heirs. During cross-examination he maintained that 
at the time of allotment, all the tenants were called up 
and Parwari placed the ‘Chant’ before Assistant 
Commissioner and land was allotted to those tenants who 
were deserving. He further deposed that land was allotted 
to those persons who were in possession of land as 
tenants. Mehboob Alam, Land Reforms Clerk, appeared 
as PW-5 and produced allotment record as Exh.P-1. 
Muhammad Ismail Patwari Halqa got recorded his 
statement as   PW-6 on 14.11.2002. He deposed that 
according to the Jamabandi Zearkar owner of the land is 
Ghulam Ali son of Ghulam Muhammad and land was 
allotted to him under Land Reform. He brought Khasra-
Girdwari for the year 1969. He deposed that Girdwari 
for the crop Kharif 1969 is in the name of Ghulam Ali 
whereas Girdwari for Rabi 1969 is in the name of 
Ghulam Ali’s father namely Ghulam Muhammad son of 
Mehar Din. He adds that there is no entry with regard to 
change of Girdwari. He further deposed that Girdawari 
is in the name of cultivators. After remand, Niaz Ali one 
of the plaintiffs appeared as PW-7. During cross- 
examination he admitted it correct that when his father 
was died in the year 1968 he was approximately at the 
age of 15 years. His brother Ashiq Ali is 1 ½  year elder 
from him whereas his brother Ghafoor is two year 
younger from him. Abdul Ghafoor one of the plaintiffs 
appeared as PW-8. During cross-examination he admitted 
it correct that his date of birth, according to Identity 
Card, is 01.01.1959. It means that he was only nine year 
old when his father was died in the year 1968. From said 
deposition it appears that all the plaintiffs were minors 
when their father was died. Said fact creates doubts that

after the death of their father how tenancy was devolved 
to all brothers and they were cultivating the land jointly. 
Plaintiffs produced allotment order as Exh.P-1. Perusal of 
said allotment order it appears that it was executed on 
Form L.R.XVI/L.R.XVII. In column No.1 with regard to 
name of tenant, parentage etc, name of Ghulam Ali 
(defendant No.1) son of Ghulam Muhammad was 
incorporated and in column No.2 Ahmadia Anjuman 
Ishaat Islam was mentioned. In Column No.20 it was 
reported that the record was perused and according to 
girdwari Ghulam Ali is found tenant from 71 to 72 and 
after verification in an open assembly (Jalsa-e-Aam) by 
the Assistant Commissioner declared him eligible. It was 
also mentioned that he is a landless, allotted land is equal 
to subsisting holding and no one raised any objection. In 
the light of said report suit property was allotted through 
order dated 15.07.1974. Thumb impression of grantee 
namely Ghulam Ali was available in column No.21. In 
the light of said allotment order Mutation No.317 was 
sanctioned on 25.04.1989 (Exh.P-2). Copy of khasra 
Girdwari from Kharif 1995 was brought on record as 
Exh.P-3. In the said khasra girdwari Ghulam Ali was 
entered in the column of ownership and name of Ashiq 
Ali is in the column of tenancy.  
           Copy of record of rights for the year 1974 was 
produced as Exh.P-4. In column No.3 with regard to 
owner, the name of Provincial Government through Land 
Commissioner Punjab Lahore is entered whereas in 
column No.4 with regard to name of cultivator, Ghulam 
Ali son of Ghulam Muhammad caste Rajput Bhatti 
Grantee (Attia-Dar) under para No.18(1) Martial Law 
Regulation No.115 resident of Deh cultivating jointly

Said record of rights is prepared first time after 
resumption and allotment of land. Although the suit 
property was already allotted through allotment order 
dated 15.07.1974 but as the mutation in this regard had 
not been attested, therefore, Provincial Government was 
shown as owner and Ghulam Ali grantee in the column 
of cultivation as “Attia Dar”. It was pointed out that 
name of the plaintiffs are also mentioned in the said 
column but their names were mentioned as tenants at will 
meaning thereby they were tenants of “Atti-Dar” namely 
Ghulam Ali. They were not shown tenants under 
Anjuman Ahmadia Ishaat Islam from whom the suit 
property was resumed. 
 
The petitioners produced copy of application with 
reports as Exh.P-5. Said documents cannot be considered 
as the order passed on the basis of said reports was 
subsequently set aside by the higher forum and 
maintained upto the Board of Revenue. The suit 
challenging said order was dismissed and said dismissal 
of suit was maintained by this Court. The plaintiffs 
produced copy of Kharra Girdwari from Kharif 1968 to 
onwards as Exh.P-6. Said Khasra Girdwari was prepared 
in the light of order dated 22.07.2008 passed by District 
Officer Revenue, Okara. Said order was subsequently set 
aside vide order dated 28.06.2004 and maintained by 
Member Board of Revenue vide order dated 19.12.2007

(Exh.D-2), therefore, entries of said Khasra Girdwari are 
not helpful to the plaintiffs’ case. 
 
Defendant No.1 got recorded his statement as  
DW-1 and produced copies of the Khasra Girdwari as 
Exh.D-1 and after remand produced order of the Member 
Board of Revenue dated 19.12.2007 as Exh.D-2. DW-1 
in his statement deposed that he was tenant of Anjuman 
Ahmadia; that land was allotted on the basis of Girdwari 
for the years 1971-72; that land was allotted after 
scrutiny; that the plaintiffs were minors at the time of 
death of their father. During cross-examination he 
deposed that girdwari was made in his name by the 
Anjuman Ahmadia itself; that they ousted the person who 
was not tenant; that beside the years 1971-72, the 
girdwari was already in his name; that after allotment the 
girdwari was remained only in his name; that all that 
time plaintiffs did not cultivate the land; that plaintiffs 
were his tenants rather tenants of Ahmadia Farm; that 
allotment was made in an open assembly. He denied the 
suggestion that they all brothers cultivated the land along 
with their father. He stated it incorrect that plaintiffs were 
cultivating the land from the life time of his father. He 
also denied the suggestion that their father partitioned the 
land in his life time. Plaintiffs were failed to shatter the 
evidence of defendant No.1 despite lengthy cross- 
examination. 
14. 
    The epitome of above discussion is that the 
plaintiffs did not succeed to prove their stance through 
available evidence. Learned counsel for the petitioners 
failed to point out any illegality, irregularity, mis-
reading, non-reading of evidence or jurisdictional defect 
in the impugned judgment and decree of the learned 
appellate court which require interference by this Court 
in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction under Section 115 
CPC.

15.           As a consequence of above, this civil revision 
has no force and the same is dismissed in limine.
