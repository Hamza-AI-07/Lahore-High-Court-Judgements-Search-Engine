of 2021), Muhammad Sajid (since acquitted), Muhammad Kashif (since 
acquitted) and his father namely Ghulam Muhammad, where all the accused 
persons after consultation developed consensus, i.e., the accused Ghulam 
Muhammad required his sons that Muhammad Riaz-the deceased, who was 
head of his family be murdered and he be taught a lesson for throwing the 
drainage water in the drain. On 12.01.2019 at about 02:00 p.m., Muhammad 
Qasim (in Crl. A. No.75010-J of 2021), Muhammad Hashim (in Crl. A. 
No.75588-J of 2021), Asif and Kashif while armed with Dangs, accused 
Sajid (since acquitted) while armed with Sairoo, left from their house while 
raising Lalkara to murder Muhammad Riaz, son of the complainant and 
rushed towards his house. The complainant Liaqat Ali (PW-11) and 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-13) heard the accused persons while consulting 
with each other about the occurrence and also saw them while running 
towards his house. On this, the complainant (PW-11) and Muhammad 
Ashraf (PW-13) also went to rescue his son. The complainant's son, 
Muhammad Riaz, was found standing outside the house, and all the accused 
persons assaulted the complainant's son, namely Muhammad Riaz, who was 
deceased. The accused, Muhammad Sajid (since acquitted), while armed 
with Sairoo, inflicted a blow, which hit Muhammad Riaz-the deceased, on 
his right shoulder backside. After that, Muhammad Qasim, the appellant (in

brother and witnessed the occurrence. The accused, Muhammad Asif, caught 
hold of Abdul Manan (given up PW) and raised Lalkara that who so ever 
came near would be done to death. On this, Muhammad Sarfraz (PW-12)

tried to intervene for rescue, but the accused Muhammad Kashif (since 
acquitted), Muhammad Sajid (since acquitted), and Muhammad Hashim-the 
appellant (in Crl. A. No.75588-J of 2021), gave blows, which hit him on his 
left arm. Then accused, Muhammad Sajid (since acquitted), gave a blow of 
Sairoo, hitting Muhammad Riaz on his back. After that, Muhammad Kashif 
(since acquitted) inflicted a Dang blow which hit Muhammad Riaz on his 
left knee. The occurrence was witnessed by Liaqat Ali-the complainant 
(PW-11), and Muhammad Ashraf (PW-13). The accused fled away while 
extending threats of dire consequences.  The complainant’s son, Muhammad 
Riaz-the deceased, went out of his senses due to severe injuries; he was 
brought to RHC Sindhilianwali. Still, due to his precarious condition, he was 
referred to DHQ Hospital, Toba Tek Singh, and then to Allied Hospital, 
Faisalabad. The following day, at 04:00 a.m., Muhammad Riaz succumbed 
to the injuries.   
4. 
 
 The motive behind the occurrence was stated to be a dispute of 
drain water dated 11.01.2019 and the altercation between accused 
Muhammad Asif and his son. After that, all the accused persons, on the 
abetment of their father, injured his son, namely Muhammad Sarfraz, and 
also murdered his son, namely Muhammad Riaz.  
5. 
 
After the incident, the complainant reported the matter to the 
police through his written application (Ex. PL), and after that, formal F.I.R 
(Ex. PM) was chalked out by Abdul Majid 613/HC (PW-8). After the 
registration of the case, the investigation of this case was conducted by 
Ghulam Mustafa-S.I (PW-14) and Zahid Hussain, SI (PW-15), who found 
the accused/appellants guilty, prepared a report under Section 173, Cr.P.C., 
and sent the same to the court of competent jurisdiction. On 16.05.2019, the 
learned trial court formally charge-sheeted the appellants, to which they 
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In support of its version, the 
prosecution produced as many as fifteen (15) witnesses.

The learned ADPP gave up PWs-Rizwan, Abdul Manan, Umer 
Hayat, and Muhammad Imran as being unnecessary and, after tendering 
report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency (Ex. PX), closed the prosecution 
evidence.

The appellants, namely Muhammad Qasim and Muhammad 
Hashim, were also examined under Section 342 Cr.P.C., wherein they did 
not opt to appear as their witnesses in Section 340(2) Cr.P.C. In response to 
a particular question about why this case was against him and why the PWs 
deposed against him, the appellant-Muhammad Qasim (in Crl. A. No. 
75010-J of 2021) made the following deposition: - 
“It is a false case registered against me and my co-
accused. All the private PWs are related interse and 
with the deceased and they deposed against me falsely 
due to enmity. The official PWs deposed against me in 
order to support the false prosecution, case the real 
facts are as under: - 
“We and complainant party are neighborer, 
whereas, Muhammad Riaz deceased reside outside 
the village, on the way to Sindhilianwali town where 
he and Abdul Manan PWs run a shop. On 11.01.2019 
complainant party thrown their filth of the drainage 
in front of our house and ill smell was spread, my 
sister in-law was ill due to which she was disturbed. 
My father Ghulam Muhammad requested Liaqat Ali 
complainant and his sons himself and through 
respectable of the village to remove the filth of 
drainage from the front of our house. Upon which 
Liaqat Ali and his sons felt insult as we were moen 
“(Kammi)” of the village and they belongs to landlord 
Jat brotherry of the village. On the next morning i.e

the bazar of Sindhiliawali where PWs Umer Hayat 
and Muhammad Imran along with two unknown 
persons stopped Muhammad Asif and beaten him 
through fists blows, due to which he became unable to 
walk. He called me and my brother there to bring him 
back to our house as he was unable to walk.  Upon

No.1888/TSL, Model 2018 China made, when we 
reached in front of the shop of Muhammad Riaz 
deceased and Abdul Manan PW where they along 
with Muhammad Ashraf PW, Riaz (since deceased), 
Sarfraz and Zubaida Bibi w/o Riaz were present there 
while armed with dandas and sotas.  They stopped us 
forcibly and attacked upon us. PW Muhammad 
Ashraf inflicted sota blow to me which landed on left 
side of my face due to said injury my jaw was broken. 
PW Abdul Manan also attacked upon me with hunter 
which hit at my left leg. Riaz (since dead) gave Sota 
blow to Hashim my brother, which hit at his left arm. 
Muhammad Ashraf PW again gave sota blow which 
hit on the left leg of the Hashim my brother. 
Muhammad Ashraf hold my brother Hashim from his 
beard and outrage the modesty of his beard and put 
him on the earth. Zubaida Bibi inflicted sota blow on 
my brother Hashim who was laying on the earth. 
Muhammad Ashraf again tried to made sota blow to 
me but his sota blow hit to Riaz (since dead).” 
Soon after the occurrence, I and my brother 
went to P.S Aroti and narrated the occurrence to 
police. Abdul Hameed 613/MHC PW prepared out 
injury statements and he sent Jamshed 904/C with us 
to RHC Sindhilianwali where we were medically 
examined and our MLCs were issued. We were 
referred to DHQ Hospital Toba Tek Singh for further 
treatment and X-rays and I was further referred to 
Allied Hospital, Faisalabad, where I was admitted, 
treated and operated upon. We submitted application 
along with our MLCs and other relevant documents 
but police did not lodge FIR against LIaqat Ali etc. 
rather on the death of Muhammad Riaz instant false 
case was registered against me and my co-accused. 
The complainant party suppressed the real facts and 
injuries sustained by me and my brother Muhammad 
Hashim. Then my uncle Muhammad Ramzan 
complainant filed a petition u/s 22-a & 22-b Cr.P.C 
before the ex-officio Justice of Peace/ASJ Pir Mahal 
titled “Muhammad Ramzan vs. SHO P.S Aroti etc.” 
which was disposed off on 15.03.2019, with the 
direction that complainant may firstly approach 
Incharge complaint cell of police Toba Tek Singh. My 
uncle Muhammad Ramzan and our witnesses 
appeared before the Incharge Investigation Cell of 
Toba Tek Singh but neither they lodge FIR nor

constituted our cross-version. Therefore, my uncle 
filed cross private complaint. The complainant party 
given up Umer Hayat and Muhammad Imran, the 
stated PWs of motive part of the occurrence, even the 
complainant did not submit any application for 
summoning of my co-accused Muhammad Asif and 
Ghulam Muhammad nor filed any private complaint 
against them.”    
 
In response to a particular question about why this case was against 
him and why the PWs deposed against him, the appellant-Muhammad 
Hashim (in Crl. A. No.75588-J of 2021) made the following deposition: - 
“It is a false case against me and my co-accused. 
Furthermore, I rely upon the answer of this question 
of my co-accused Muhammad Qasim.” 
 
9. 
 
After evaluating the evidence available on record in light of 
arguments advanced by both sides, the learned trial court found the 
prosecution version proved beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt, which 
resulted in the appellants’ conviction in the above terms.  
10. 
 
We have given our anxious and most thoughtful consideration 
to both sides’ rival submissions. We have minutely gone through the 
evidence on record. 
11. 
 
The occurrence took place on 12-01-2019 at 02:00 p.m. in the 
area of Chak No. 764 G.B. Tehsil Pir-Mahal, situated within the jurisdiction 
of Police Station Aroti, District Toba Tek Singh, which is at a distance of

Sindhilianwali, District Toba Tek Singh. The F.I.R. (Exh. PM) was got 
lodged by Liaqat Ali (PW-11)-the complainant, after a considerable delay of 
(19) hours without explaining the said delay. Liaqat Ali (PW-11)-the

Liaqat Ali (PW-11)-the complainant has four sons except  Riaz-deceased, 
and none reported the incident to the police. Liaqat Ali (PW-11)-the 
complainant deposed during cross-examination that: -  
“Riaz deceased was shifted to P.S first and then 
to hospital. I alongwith my two/three sons went 
to P.S. We did not make any application to 
police at that time. We remained at P.S, 5 to 7 
minutes and then proceed to hospital. When we 
shifted the injured to hospital I accompanied 
them.” 
Muhammad Sarfaraz (PW-12), the injured witness and brother of the 
deceased, had not come up with facts. He (PW-12) has not deposed that soon 
after the incident, he was taken to the police station, his docket was issued,

medically examined. Soon after the occurrence 
I was shifted to RHC Sindhlianwali. Deceased 
Riaz was referred to DHQ hospital due to his 
serious condition” 
12. 
 
Besides, during cross-examination, Muhammad Sarfaraz (PW-
12) deposed that the police recorded his statement after two/three days after 
the occurrence. Muhammad Sarfaraz (PW-12) deposed during cross-
examination that: -  
“I got recorded my statement under section 161 
Cr.P.C to the police after two/three days of the 
occurrence in our village at the place of 
occurrence.” 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-13), eye witness and nephew of the complainant 
also had not come up with facts. Muhammad Ashraf (PW-13) deposed 
during examination-in-chief that: -   
“Accused fled away while raising Lalkaras. We

Muhammad 
Riaz 
to

Ali (PW-11)-the complainant reported the incident through written 
complaint (Ex. PL) to Ghulam Mustafa, S.I. (PW-14)-Investigating Officer 
at 09:00 a.m. on 13.01.2019 who referred the complaint (Ex.PL) to Police 
Station, based on which, formal FIR (Ex.PM) was chalked out on the same 
day at 01:45 a.m. In a given case, it is open to the prosecution to indicate 
reasons for the delayed reporting of the incident to the police. Even the 
entire prosecution evidence is silent that who informed Ghulam Mustafa, S.I. 
(PW-14)-Investigating Officer about the incident. Liaqat Ali (PW-11)-the 
complainant deposed that the police were informed. This has to be 
established by evidence. However, who reported to the police and when 
same was not stated. It is admitted that Liaqat Ali (PW-11)-the complainant, 
did not go to the police station to report the incident. Liaqat Ali (PW-11)-the 
complainant deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“Cell phone Number given on the application 
Exh.PL was in my use. I did not make any 
telephone call on 15 regarding this occurrence.” 
To determine whether the FIR was lodged when it is alleged to have been 
recorded, the Courts generally look for certain external checks. It has been 
noticed that in  the  inquest report (Ex. PK),   the names of Liaqat Ali (PW-
11)-the complainant, Muhammad Ashraf (PW-13), and Muhammad Sarfaraz 
(PW-12) have not been mentioned. Any of these witnesses does not sign the 
inquest report (Ex. PK). The absence of those details indicates that the 
prosecution story was still in an embryo state and had not been given any 
shape and that the FIR came to be recorded later on after due deliberations 
and consultations and was then ante-timed. In our opinion, on account of the 
infirmities, as noticed above, the FIR has lost its value and authenticity, and 
it appears to us that the same has been ante-timed and had not been recorded 
till the inquest proceedings were over by Ghulam Mustafa, S.I. (PW-14)-
Investigating Officer. It gets support from the recovery memo of the last 
worn clothes of the deceased (Ex. PA), the recovery memo of injury 
statement of the deceased (Ex. PJ), and the un-scaled site plan (Ex. PU),

from which it reveals that after writing “بنام” space was left blank. Ghulam 
Mustafa, S.I (PW-14)-Investigating Officer admitted during cross 
examination that “left blank against the word Biaan” This suggests that until 
receiving the deceased's last worn clothes by Ghulam Mustafa, S.I. (PW-
14)-Investigating Officer, the FIR was not in existence, the Roznamcha was 
withheld, and the ante-timed FIR was registered. Dr. Muhammad Babar 
Aslam (PW-7) deposed that the post-mortem examination of the dead body 
was conducted at 10:55 a.m. on 13.01.2019. The death occurred at 04:30 
a.m. on 13.01.2019; the dead body was received in the dead house at 09:00 
a.m. Police documents were received at 10:35 a.m. on 13.01.2019.  FIR (Ex. 
PM) was chalked out at 09:30 a.m., but the same was not produced before 
Dr. Muhammad Babar Aslam (PW-7). Dr. Muhammad Babar Aslam (PW-7) 
deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“It is correct that except injury statement 
Exh.PJ and inquest report Exh.PK, no other 
document was produced before me. ---- Dead 
body was received at 09.00 AM whereas police 
papers were received at 10.35 AM, then I 
conducted autopsy at 10.55 AM. Muhammad 
Aslam and Muhammad Asghar appeared 
before me of their own. It is correct that I did 
not mention their CNIC numbers and their 
relationship with the deceased. --- It is correct 
that pages No.1 and 3 of inquest report Exh. PD 
did not bear my stamp and signature. 
Volunteered that in endorsed Exh. PK at page 
No.3. It is correct that my signature and stamp 
are affixed at the bottom of page No.2. There is 
blank space at the middle of said page.” 
Dr. Muhammad Babar Aslam (PW-7) deposed during cross-examination 
that:- 
“It is correct that except injury statement Ex.PJ 
and inquest report Ex.PK, no other document 
was produced before me….Dead body was 
received at 09:00 AM whereas police papers 
were received at 10:35 AM, then I conducted 
autopsy at 10:55 AM. Muhammad Aslam and

Muhammad Asghar appeared before me of 
their own. It is correct that I did not mention 
their CNIC numbers and their relationship with 
the deceased.” 
There is no plausible explanation for why the incident was reported delayed 
for nineteen (19) hours. Liaqat Ali (PW-11)-the complainant took time in 
drafting the complaint and deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“I got drafted the application from computer 
center situated at Sindhlianwali Chowk. I do 
not remember the name of computer operator. I 
did not produce the said writer to the I.O 
during investigation.” 
From the deposition of Liaqat Ali (PW-11), the complainant reveals that 
after bringing back the dead body of Muhammad Riaz, the deceased, he 
went to Sindhilianwali Chowk and composed the complaint (Ex. PL). The 
complainant (PW-11) took him in drafting the complaint (Ex. PL). Delay in 
reporting the incident also leads to the conclusion that the F.I.R. was 
recorded with a delay and the F.I.R. had not been recorded at the time it is 
claimed to have been recorded. This aspect of the matter is sufficient to cast 
doubt about the authenticity of the F.I.R. This creates serious doubt about 
the genuineness of the prosecution story, including the presence of the 
complainant and eye witness at the scene of occurrence. Delay lodging the 
FIR often results in embellishment, a creature of an afterthought. 
Considering all these facts, we have no hesitation in concluding that the 
prosecution has not been able to prove on record that the incident was 
reported when it was claimed to have been recorded. 
13. 
 
As per the prosecution version put forth in the written 
complaint (Ex. PL), FIR (Ex. PM), and deposed by Liaqat Ali (PW-11)-the 
complainant that after receiving injuries, Muhammad Riaz (deceased) then 
injured became unconscious and he (PW-11) got his docket and brought him 
to RHC Sindhilianwali. Liaqat Ali (PW-11)-the complainant deposed during 
cross-examination that: -

“Riaz deceased was shifted to P.S. first and then 
to hospital.” 
Muhammad Sarfaraz (PW-12) and Muhammad Ashraf (PW-13) have not 
deposed that after the occurrence, they took Muhammad Riaz (deceased), 
then injured first, to the police station. Dr. Muhammad Babar Aslam (PW-7) 
deposed during examination-in-chief that: - 
“Stated that on  12.01.2019, I was posted as 
Medical Officer RHC Sindhlianwali. On the 
same day, I medically examined Muhammad 
Riaz s/o Liaqat Ali, caste Jat, resident of Chak 
No.764/GB Tehsil Pir Mahal at 02.40 PM, 
brought by Muhammad Hussain 487-C. 
Brief History: 
“That we were draining out the sewerage 
water of our house when Qasim and 
Hashim etc, attacked me with “dandas” 
(clubs) and injured me.” 
 
 
Examination and Clothes: blood stained. 
 
 
Physical Examination: He was vitally stable.  
From the contents of the injury statement of Muhammad Riaz (Ex. PE), it 
reveals that Muhammad Riaz (deceased), then injured, stated that  ‘‘یمسم الغم دمحم
وریغہ ےن رضمو ب ایک ےہ’’. Similar is written in the injury statement of Muhammad 
Serfaraz (PW-12). In the injury statement and application for conducting a 
postmortem examination of the dead body of Muhammad Riaz-deceased 
(Ex. PJ), it was mentioned that “  گ ب وک ایمسمن467 کچ ہنکس یمسم دمحم رایض ودل ایلتق وقم ٹج
گ ب اک ڈڈنوں،وسوٹں ےس رضموب رکےک لتق رکان ایبن وہا ےہ۔ 467 دمحماقمس ودل الغم دمحم وقم ومیچ ہنکس کچ .”  A dying 
declaration was not got recorded. In all injury statements and MLC (Ex. PD) 
Muhammad Riaz (deceased), then injured, different statements were written 
about who caused injuries on his person. To ascertain whether the statement 
of Muhammad Riaz (then injured) was authentic and correct, in the sense 
that it was the statement of Muhammad Riaz (then injured) and that

whatever he said had been correctly recorded, we examined the prosecution 
evidence and also gone through the MLC (Ex. PD) Muhammad Riaz (then 
injured) as in who’s presence statement was made and found that Liaqat Ali 
(PW-11)-the complainant was present with Muhammad Riaz (then injured) 
as he (PW-11) signed the affidavit of MLC (Ex. PD) of Muhammad Riaz. 
Dr. Muhammad Babar Aslam (PW-7) deposed during examination-in-chief 
that:- 
“Exh. PD is the original carbon copy of MLC 
and Exh.PD/1 is the sketch of injuries which are 
in my handwriting and bear my signatures. I 
also endorsed Exh.PE, the injury statement of 
Muhammad Riaz.” 
Moreover, it is clear that at least the dying declaration of the deceased-
Muhammad Riaz, was not in the picture, and Dr. Muhammad Babar Aslam 
(PW-7) has not specifically stated that he wrote the statement of 
Muhammad Riaz (then injured) in the column meant for a brief history of 
the MLC. This being the position, we are of the view that there is a great 
deal of doubt surrounding the question of correctness and authenticity of the 
entries made in the injury statement of Muhammad Riaz (Ex. PE), injury 
statement and the application for conducting a postmortem examination of 
the dead body of Muhammad Riaz-deceased (Ex. PJ) and MLC (Ex. PD) 
that who caused injuries on the person of Muhammad Riaz-deceased. Such 
a state of affairs casts severe doubts on the prosecution’s version.  
14. 
 
As per the prosecution case, the occurrence was initiated on 
12.01.2019 at 01:00 p.m. accused Asif (not summoned to face trial) made a 
quarrel with the complainant’s son Umar Hayat (not produced) at 
Sindhilianwali in the shop of Umar Hayat due to the drainage of water from 
the drain. After that, teaching lessons for quarreling and interrupting the 
crossing of water from the drainage, the appellants, along with their co-
accused (since acquitted) while raising slogans to murder Muhammad Riaz-
deceased, went to the house of Muhammad Riaz-deceased, who was

standing outside his home where the appellants, along with their co-accused 
(since acquitted) caused injuries to him. To prove the ocular account, the 
prosecution produced Liaqat Ali (PW-11)-the complainant, Muhammad 
Sarfaraz (PW-12), and Muhammad Ashraf (PW-13). Liaqat Ali (PW-11)-the 
complainant deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“It is correct that residence of Riaz 
deceased is situated in Killa No.1 Square 
No.15. We purchased Killa No.15, Fifteen 
years back and Riaz deceased was residing 
there. My house is situated at a distance of 2 
½ Acres from the house of Riaz deceased. ---
- All my sons except Riaz deceased are 
residing with me. Riaz deceased was 
electrician and his shop was situated at 
Adda Sindhlianwali. Adda Sindhlianwali is 
situated at four kilometers from my house.” 
Muhammad Sarfaraz (PW-12) deposed during cross-examination that: -   
“The house of Riaz situated at a distance of 
about two Acres from my house. ---- The 
house of Ashraf PW is situated at the 
distance of one Acre from our house.” 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-13), eye witness and nephew of the complainant, 
deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“Liaqat Ali complainant is my real Chacha. 
My house is at the distance of 1 ½ acres 
from the house of Liaqat Ali. There is 
continuous residences between my house 
and house of Liaqat Ali. The house of Riaz 
deceased is situated out of village Abadi in 
the agricultural land towards eastern side 
from our house. There is residential area 
between my house and house of Riaz 
deceased as well as Liaqat Ali, the 
complainant.”

Ghulam Mustafa, SI (PW-14)-the Investigating Officer deposed during 
cross-examination that: -   
“The place of occurrence is situated towards 
south from the main metaled road which leads 
from Chak No.764/GB to Adda Sindhlianwali. 
The level of said road is 1 ½ feet in height from 
the agricultural land. The place of occurrence 
as mentioned by in Exh.PU is crop of garlic. I 
had mentioned the grocery shop of Abdul 
Munan towards west from the place of 
occurrence. I had shown a tube-well of 
Muhammad Riaz deceased further towards 
west and then I had not shown the direction 
from which the assailants were reached at the 
place of occurrence. I had not shown the vehicle 
through which the assailant departed from the 
place of occurrence. I had also not shown as to 
whether the assailants departed from the place 
of occurrence on foot or through vehicle. I had 
not shown the houses of complainant and 
witnesses in Exh.PU. Place of occurrence is 
situated outside but near the village Abadi in 
the agricultural land. I had shown the 
agricultural land of Mukhtar Ahmed Guru, 
towards north of the place of occurrence. Said 
Mukhtar Ahmed Gru, did not join investigation 
at the time of my first visit in support of 
complainant’s version…….I did not prepare 
site plan of drainage which was mentioned by 
the complainant in his application Exh.PL. I did 
not visit the above said place i.e. drainage, in 
order 
to 
ascertain 
the 
motive 
part 
of 
occurrence. No body from the village including 
Chowkidar, Lambardar, Councillor, Chairman 
Usher Zakat Committee or Chairman of Water 
Committee, joined investigation in order to 
support the motive part of the occurrence. 
Complainant did not produce before me copy of 
any application which was given by him to 
Public Health Department or any other 
Government Department about the issue of 
drainage.”

Liaqat Ali (PW-11)-the complainant stated that the occurrence 
occurred in front of Muhammad Riaz-deceased's house. The un-scaled site 
plan (Ex. PU) reveals that the incident happened in the garlic field adjacent to 
the grocery Shop of Abdul Manan. Shabbir Hussain Halqa Patwari (PW-5) 
prepared scaled site plans (Ex. PD and Ex. PD/1) on 27.01.2010, fifteen days 
after the occurrence, and deposed during cross-examination that: -  
“In particulars of the place of occurrence with 
reference to Square number and Killa number, 
I did not mention the number of Chak in which 
square number and Killa number shown falls. 
Name of the owner of Killa No.1, Square No.15 
is not mentioned in map. Names of owners of 
adjoining land were not mentioned. I did not 
show the crops standing over the surrounding 
fields. I did not mention specific role of the 
accused over any points shown in the map. I 
have not shown any shop on the western side of 
the Killa No.1. Whatever I was told by the 
complainant and witnesses I mentioned the 
same in map.” 
The prosecution version was that the appellants and their co-accused 
attacked Muhammad Riaz-the deceased, in front of his home. But 
above stated testimony of the witnesses shows that the incident 
occurred in garlic fields. From the place of occurrence, the 
Investigating Officer did not secure the blood-stained earth. Liaqat Ali 
(PW-11)-the complainant deposed during cross-examination that:- 
“The clothes of Riaz were stained with blood, 
however, no blood was present at the place of 
occurrence. I rescued my son with the help of 
my other sons. My clothes were also stained 
with his blood. The clothes of the witnesses 
might be stained with blood.” 
 
  The blood was oozing from the injuries, and the clothes of the 
complainant and car were stained with blood.  Ghulam Mustafa, SI 
(PW-14), visited the spot, and no blood was found, which makes the 
place of occurrence doubtful. As far place of the motorcycle is

concerned, Zahid Hussain S.I. (PW-15)-investigating officer, deposed 
during cross-examination that: -  
“The Halqa Patwari took rough notes of place 
of occurrence in my presence. It is correct that 
the complainant and PWs did not point out any 
motorcycle which was used by the accused 
persons. They also did not point out any place 
where the accused fell down from their 
motorcycle after departing from stated place of 
occurrence. The place of occurrence is situated 
in agricultural land outside the village. The 
halqa patwari did not mention the name of 
owner of square No.15 as well as Killa No.1 in 
scaled site plan Exh.PG and Exh.PB/1. During 
my investigation, I did not prepare the site plan 
of place, regarding motive part of the 
occurrence. 
No 
lumberdar, 
chowkidar, 
counselor of the village or officials of the public 
health joined my investigation regarding the 
motive part of the occurrence. According to my 
case diaries, I never visited the place regarding 
the motive part of the occurrence. Witness 
volunteered that I have visited the above said 
place but did not mention this fact in my 
investigation.” 
Liaqat Ali (PW-11)-the complainant deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“We did not make any application regarding 
the 
previous 
occurrence 
took 
place 
on 
11.01.2019. We also did not move any 
application to Public Health Department 
regarding dispute of drainage. We did not yet 
make 
any 
application 
regarding 
quarrel 
between Asif and Umar Hayyat on 12.01.2019, 
prior to this occurrence.” 
The bone of contention is the flow of drainage water through the drain. 
Where the drain was situated has not been proved by the prosecution. All the 
material was liable to be considered by the investigating officers. Police 
failed to investigate the motive part of the present case. The neighbor of the 
accused person Muhammad Ramzan filed a private complaint titled

“Ramzan versus Liaqat Ali etc.” (Ex. DD) on 01-09-2021 with the version 
that Liaqat Ali (PW-11)-the complainant put dirty drainage material outside 
the house of the accused party which caused the incident. Dr. Muhammad 
Babar Aslam (PW-7) deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“It is correct that on 12.01.2019 at 2.30 P.M, 
Jamshed Ahamd 904-C produced before me 
Muhammad 
Qasim, 
accused 
with 
injury 
statement. He was examined at 2.45 P.A vide 
MLC Exh. DA which is in my handwriting. 
Qasim was referred to DHQ Hospital, Toba Tek 
Singh after initial examination. There is no 
possibility of fabrication of injuries of the 
victim. Duration of injuries was 2 to 3 hours 
and found to be caused with blunt weapon. It is 
correct on receiving the report of Radiologist, I 
declared injury No.1 Shajja Hashima. My final 
report Exh. DA/1 is in my handwriting. I also 
endorsed the injury statement Exh. DB.  
On the same day Hashim, accused was also 
produced before me for medical examination by 
the said constable and I examined him at 02.30 
PM. MLC Exh. DC of this victim is in my 
handwriting. No chance of fabrication was 
observed.” 
Liaqat Ali (PW-11)-the complainant deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“After four/five minutes, the accused Qasim 
and Hashim also came to hospital for their 
medical examination. They were also examined 
by the same doctor who examined the deceased 
Riaz……. I did not incorporate in the 
application that Qasim and Hashim were also 
injured.” 
Muhammad Serfaraz (PW-12) deposed during cross-examination that: -   
“I did not come into my knowledge that Qasim 
and Hashim were also injured. It is correct that 
accused party filed a private complaint which 
was fixed for today in this court. My name is 
written on the serial No.6 of the accused 
persons in the complaint. The house of the

accused are situated adjacent to our house. I 
did not join the investigation of this case.” 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-13), eye witness and nephew of the complainant, 
deposed during cross-examination that: -   
“I did not get record to the I.O that Hashim and 
Qasim were also injured during the occurrence. 
Volunteered that I do not know regarding their 
injuries. It is correct to suggest that my 
volunteer portion is false. I do not know the 
same doctor who examined Riaz, later-on 
examined the injured Qasim and Hashim 
accused.” 
Ghulam Mustafa S.I. (PW-14)-investigating officer also deposed during 
cross-examination that: -   
“On my first day of investigation, I also visited 
P.S, Arrotti. Abdul Majeed was Moharrer of 
P.S Arrotti. I had recorded his statement 
during investigation. It was not in my 
knowledge after interrogation of said Abdul 
Majeed that he prepared injury statements of 
Muhammad Qasim and Muhammad Hashim 
accused on 12.01.2019. Volunteered that he did 
not tell me about said injury statements. ----- 
Injury statements of Muhammad Riaz deceased 
(in injured condition) and Sarfraz PW are 
present on file. It is correct that both injury 
statements were prepared by Abdul Majeed 
Moharrar on 12.01.2019.” 
Abdul Majeed 613-HC (PW-8) deposed during cross-examination that: -   
“On 12.01.2019 I was on duty. On the said date 
I prepared injury statement of Muhammad 
Qasim accused at police station. Qasim had told 
me that he has been injured by Abdul Manan 
etc. Injury statement Exh. DB is in my 
handwriting. On the same day I prepared 
injury statement of Hashim accused, who had 
told me that he has been injured by Sarfraz 
etc.”

The defence version, not a confession and exculpatory in which the accused-
appellants had denied the guilt, could not be used as evidence to prove their 
guilt. Besides, the injuries of grave nature received by the accused-
Muhammad Qasim, during the same occurrence would indicate a fight 
between both parties. In such a situation, the question of the genesis of the 
fight, that is to say, the events leading to the fight and which party initiated 
the first attack, assumes great importance in reaching the ultimate decision. 
It is here that needs to explain the injuries of serious nature received by the 
accused in the course of the same occurrence arises. When the explanation is 
given, the correctness of the reason is liable to be tested. If there is an 
omission to explain, it may lead to the inference that the prosecution has 
suppressed some of the relevant details concerning the incident. Ultimately, 
the factum of non-explanation of injuries must be kept in view while 
appreciating the evidence of prosecution witnesses. So also, where the 
defence version accords with probabilities to such an extent that it is difficult 
to say which version is true, then the factum of non-explanation of the 
injuries assumes greater importance. Much depends on the quality of the 
evidence adduced by the prosecution. Returning to the present situation, 
admittedly independent and reliable evidence, including the dying 
declaration of the deceased, is not available on the record. The injuries on 
the person of the appellants are proved by the MLC (Ex. DC) and through 
Dr. Muhammad Babar Aslam (PW-7). The complainant has four sons 
(excluding the deceased) and a nephew, but none had reported the incident 
to the police. Liaqat Ali (PW-11)-the complainant admitted during cross-
examination that:- 
“Accused Asif and Ghulam Muhammad were 
not found involved in the occurrence during 
investigation. We did not make any application 
for the summoning of Asif and Ghulam 
Muhammad during the trial. We also did not 
file a private complaint against them.” 
Liaqat Ali (PW-11)-the complainant had not produced Umer Hayat as a 
witness, with whom Muhammad Asif quarreled at 01:00 p.m. on 

Murder Reference No.172of 2021, 
Crl. Appeal No.  75010-J of 2021,

12.01.2012. Therefore, an adverse inference is to be drawn within Article 
129 (g) of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, that had Umer Hayat appeared as a 
witness, his testimony would have been unfavorable to the prosecution.  
Reliance is placed on the case reported as “The State and others  v. Abdul 
Khaliq and others” (PLD 2011 SC 554). The defense version cannot be 
considered for establishing the presence of the accused persons on the spot. 
Where the prosecution evidence was discarded, the defence taken by the 
accused had to be believed or disbelieved in toto. The defence plea taken by 
the appellants and their co-accused has not been proved. However, it is a 
settled principle of law for the prosecution to stand on its legs.  It was for the 
prosecution to prove the charge beyond any shadow of doubt.  Moreover, the 
trial can not benefit from the weakness of the defence plea. In the case of 
“Shera Masih and another  v. The State” (PLD 2002 SC 643), it has been 
held that: - 
 “----Defence plea of the accused even if is not 
 
supported 
by 
any 
evidence 
direct 
or 
circumstantial 
and 
is 
discarded 
being 
improbable, still it will not be a circumstance to 
prove the guilt of an accused and the 
prosecution has to establish its case by standing 
on its own legs.” 
All the above-narrated facts and circumstances lead this Court to only one 
conclusion that the whole prosecution case seems to be hinging upon 
conjectures and surmises, and it had severely failed to show incriminating, 
corroborative/independent evidence to bring home guilt of the accused in the 
case of capital charge. It must be realized that the well-established rule of 
criminal justice is that the 'fouler the crime higher the proof. The learned 
trial court was not justified in convicting the appellants while basing upon 
such un-trustworthy, uncorroborated evidence, and the conviction passed by 
the learned trial court in the circumstances is against all cannons of law 
recognized for the dispensation of criminal justice.  As per dictates of the 
law, the benefit of every doubt is to be extended in favor of the accused.  In

the case of “Muhammad Akram  v. The State” (2009 SCMR 230), it has 
been held as under: - 
 
“--Benefit of doubt----Principles--- 
For giving the benefit of doubt it is not necessary 
that there should be many circumstances 
creating doubts. ---Single circumstance creating 
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the 
guilt of accused makes him entitled to its benefit, 
not as a matter of grace and concession, but as a 
matter of right.”  
 
It is a golden principle of law that the Court should let off a hundred guilty 
but should not convict one innocent person.  In the case of “Ayub Masih  v.  
The State”  (PLD 2002 SC 1048), it has been held by the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan that:- 
“----It is hardly necessary to reiterate that the 
prosecution is obliged to prove its case against 
the accused beyond any reasonable doubt and 
if it fails to do so the accused is entitled to the 
benefit of doubt as of right. It is also firmly 
settled that if there is an element of doubt as to 
the guilt of the accused the benefit of that 
doubt must be extended to him. The doubt of 
course must be reasonable and not imaginary 
or artificial. The rule of benefit of doubt, which 
is described as the golden rule, is essentially a 
rule of prudence which can not be ignored 
while dispensing justice in accordance with 
law. It is based on the maxim, “it is better that 
ten guilty persons be acquitted rather than one 
innocent person be convicted”. 
 In simple words it means that utmost care 
should be taken by the Court in convicting an 
accused. It has further been held in “The State  
v.  Mushtaq Ahmed” (PLD 1973 SC 418) that 
this rule is antithesis of haphazard approach or 
reaching a fitful decision in a case. It will not be 
out of place to mention here that this rule 
occupies a pivotal place in the Islamic law and 
is enforced rigorously in view of the saying of 
the Holy Prophet (P.B.U.H) that the “mistake

of Qazi (Judge) in releasing a criminal is better 
than his mistake in punishing an innocent”.  
15. 
 
Based on the discussion made above, the only conclusion which 
may be arrived at is that the prosecution has failed to establish the guilt of 
the appellants beyond all reasonable doubts and the findings came by the 
learned trial court and recording conviction thereon could not be sustained 
and are liable to be set aside. We, therefore, accept in toto Criminal Appeals 
No.75010-J of 2021 & 75588-J of 2021 filed by Muhammad Qasim and 
Muhammad Hashim, the appellants. As a result, the conviction and sentence 
recorded by the learned trial court vide judgment dated 13.10.2021 is set 
aside. The appellants, namely Muhammad Qasim and Muhammad Hashim, 
are ordered to be acquitted of the charge in the case of F.I.R. No.14 of 2019, 
dated 13.01.2019, under Sections 302/337-L(ii)/34 PPC, registered at Police 
Station Aroti, District Toba Tek Singh.  The appellant-Muhammad Qasim 
(in Crl. A. No.75010-J of 2021) and Muhammad Hasim (in Crl. A. 
No.75588-J of 2021), both sons of Ghulam Muhammad, caste Mochi, 
resident of Chak No.764/GB, Tehsil Pir Mahal, District Toba Tek Singh are 
directed to be released forthwith if not required in any other case. 
        Murder Reference No.172 of 2021 was forwarded by the learned trial 
court for confirmation of the sentence of death inflicted upon the convict 
fails, answered in NEGNATIVE. 
16. 
 
So far as Criminal Revision No.69106 of 2021 seeking 
enhancement of the sentence of respondent No.2 is concerned, for the above-
stated reasons, the same has no weight, which is accordingly dismissed. 
17. 
 
 So far as CRIMINAL APPEAL No.79499 of 2021 seeking a 
conviction of respondents No.2 and 3, namely Muhammad Kashif and 
Muhammad Sajid, is concerned, we have noted that respondents No.2 and 3 
were attributed injuries on the non-vital parts of the persons of Muhammad 
Riaz and Muhammad Sarfraz. For what has been discussed above in the light 
of prosecution, medical, and documentary evidence, the acquittal of

respondents No.2 and 3 does not suffer from any illegality to call for our 
interference with the impugned judgment to the extent of respondents No.2 
and 3. We have also taken note of the settled principle of criminal 
jurisprudence that unless it can be shown that the lower court’s judgment is 
perverse or that it is completely illegal. No other conclusion can be drawn 
except the guilt of the accused or misreading or non-reading of evidence 
resulting in a miscarriage of justice. Even otherwise, when a court of 
competent jurisdiction acquits the accused, the double presumption of 
innocence is attached to his case.  The acquittal order cannot be interfered 
with, whereby a charged earns double presumption of innocence as held in 
Muhammad Mansha Kausar v. Muhammad Ashgar and others (2003 
SCMR 477).  In this case, the prosecution has not been able to bring on 
record adequate incriminating evidence against respondents No.2 and 3, 
which connects them with the alleged crime.  The learned trial Judge has 
advanced valid and plausible reasons for recording acquittal in favor of 
respondents No.2 and 3. The judgment of acquittal does not call for any 
interference. Consequently, we find no merit in this Criminal Appeal 
bearing No.79499 of 2021, which is, as a result of this, dismissed as being 
without merits.
