Date of Hearing: 
04.11.2024 
Appellant by: 
Malik Tahir Mahmood, Advocate.  
Respondent No.1 by: Mr. Tahir Malik, Advocate.  
Respondent No.2 by: Proceeded against ex-parte vide order 
dated 21.12.2022. 
Anwaar Hussain J. Through this single judgment, the present 
as well as connected appeal, bearing FAO No.84/2016, filed under 
Section 24 of the Cantonments Rent Restriction Act, 1963 (“the Act”), 
are simultaneously being decided as in both the cases the landlord-
respondent No.1 (“the respondent”), substantial evidence brought on 
record, and the legal question put forth before this Court for 
determination, are the same. Moreover, the rented premises, i.e., shops 
in occupation of the appellants, are part of the same building.   
2. 
The present appeal is directed against the impugned ejectment 
order dated 21.06.2016 passed in eviction petition filed by the 
respondent against the appellant, under Section 17 of the Act. Similarly, 
the connected appeal bearing FAO No.84/2016 is also directed against 
order of even date i.e., 21.06.2016 passed in eviction petition filed by 
the respondent against the appellant of the connected appeal, namely, 
Muhammad Yousaf Khan and respondent No.2 therein, namely, Malik 
Khalid Mehmood. In present appeal, Ch. Muhammad Ishaq has been 
also arrayed as respondent No.2 (respondent No.3 in connected appeal).

3. 
By way of factual background, it has been noted that the 
respondent claimed that he, alongwith his brothers, purchased property, 
bearing No.877, 877-1 to 877-4 situated at Misrial Road, Dhoke 
Syedan, Rawalpindi (“the property”) through registered sale deeds 
bearing documents No.713, 714 and 715 all dated 16.02.1993, which 
comprises of various shops and one of the said shops bearing No.CB-
877/2 is in occupation of the present appellant as tenant who stopped 
making payment of monthly rent since December, 2011 whereas shop 
bearing No.877/4 is in occupation of the appellant of the connected 
appeal. As regards the appellant of connected appeal, the respondent 
claimed that he entered into the rent agreement with respondent No.2 
therein/Malik Khalid Mehmood, who agreed to handover possession of 
the rented premises to the respondent in October, 2012 but the needful 
was not done and the rent was not paid after October, 2012 while 
subletting the rented shop to the appellant of the connected appeal, i.e., 
Muhammad Yousaf Khan. The above-mentioned facts constrained the 
respondent to file two separate eviction petitions against the appellants.   
4. 
The eviction petitions were contested by the appellants raising 
preliminary objections, inter alia, denying relationship of landlord and 
tenant. In particular, the appellants claimed that they are tenant of 
present respondent No.2, namely, Ch. Muhammad Ishaq son of Ch. 
Muhammad Sadiq. It was also contended by the appellants that there 
was civil litigation pending adjudication, regarding the ownership of 
the property, between the respondent and one Nouroze Khan and above 
referred Ch. Muhammad Ishaq. Out of the divergent pleadings, two 
issues including that of relief were framed in both the eviction petitions. 
The primary issue was existence of relationship of landlord and tenant 
between the parties. It is imperative to observe that the eviction 
petitions were filed by the respondent himself, however, during the 
pendency of the eviction petitions, he proceeded abroad and one Haji

declaration as Exh.P6 and attested copy of application submitted to 
District Judge, Rawalpindi for re-admission as Exh.R7. 
6. 
Insofar as the eviction petition filed against the present appellant 
is concerned, during the course of recording of the evidence, the 
Additional Rent Controller got forensic examination of the rent 
agreement (Exh.P3) executed between the appellant and the 
respondent, and it was verified that the thumb impression on the rent 
agreement is that of the appellant, which led the Additional Rent 
Controller to conclude that the relation between the appellant and the 
respondent existed and accordingly, the impugned ejectment order was 
passed. In connected appeal bearing FAO No.84/2016, the Additional 
Rent Controller allowed the said eviction petition while observing that 
the documentary evidence of the respondent suggests that the 

 
5 
FAO No.83/2016 
 
 
respondent has been paying taxes of the property (of which the rented 
premises are part); that the electricity meter of the premises is in the 
name of the respondent; and that during the cross-examination, the 
appellant gave evasive replies to the questions pertaining to the 
relationship of landlord and tenant, tax and utility bills showing his 
ignorance about the status of the rented premises.  
7. 
Learned counsel for the appellant, inter alia, contends that the 
impugned order(s) are sketchy and have been passed without adverting 
to the evidence available on record. The main emphasis has been laid 
on the point that the entire evidence in support of the respondent cannot 
be taken into account as the special attorney, namely, Haji Lal Hussain 
who appeared on behalf of the respondent, in both the ejectment 
petitions, had no power to prosecute the eviction petitions or lead 
evidence and hence, the superstructure built thereon is not sustainable.    
8. 
Respondent No.2, namely, Ch. Muhammad Ishaq has already 
been proceeded against ex-parte, vide order dated 21.12.2022, 
however, it has been noted that the said respondent was not a party 
before the Additional Rent Controller, in the eviction petitions filed 
against the present as well as the appellant of connected appeal; and 
only appeared as witness (RW.2), in both the cases, in favour of the 
appellants. During the proceedings before this Court, request was also 
made on behalf of the appellant(s) to delete the name of said 
respondent/Ch. Muhammad Ishaq from the array of the parties. 
Respondent No.2, namely, Malik Khalid Mehmood in connected 
appeal has also been proceeded against ex-parte on 08.02.2022.   
9. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent supported the 
impugned findings with the averment that even if the special power of 
attorney (Exh.P/1) is found defective, the same is not fatal to the case 
of the respondent as the said special attorney, namely, Haji Lal Hussain 
was also holding another power of attorney of the respondent having 

 
6 
FAO No.83/2016 
 
 
all the powers to act on behalf of the respondent in respect of the 
property although said separate power of attorney was not brought on 
record.  
10. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
11. 
The nub of the matter is to examine whether the evidence led and 
got recorded by the special attorney, namely, Haji Lal Hussain has any 
evidentiary value, keeping in view the contents of the special power of 
attorney (Exh.P1), therefore, it will be appropriate to first examine how 
the power of attorney is to be interpreted and then, analyze the contents 
of the special power of attorney (Exh.P/1).  
12. 
There is no cavil with the proposition that a power of attorney 
and/or the extent of powers conferred thereunder should be construed 
strictly. In the same vein, such strict interpretation is to be confined to 
such power of attorney only where the same runs counter to the interest 
of the principal. However, where the issue involves accretion of right 
of the principal, the same may be interpreted to the advantage of the 
principal. The Supreme Court of Pakistan in case reported as “Qadir 
Bakhsh and 10 others v. Kh. Nizamuddin and 4 others” (2001 SCMR 
1091) held as under:  
“19. …Generally, in interpreting the power of attorney, it 
is ignored that it has two aspects: (i) the power to do 
something on behalf of the principal which is generally 
beneficial to him and (ii) the power to exercise the discretion 
depriving the principal of his right to his assets, properties 
etc. The part of the power of attorney which tends to 
accretion of the right to the properties and assets to the 
principal may not be interpreted in stringent terms for 
instance to file a suit or appeal as has been clearly laid down 
in the power of attorney in the instant case authorizing the 
attorney to file suit/action either civil or criminal or to 
defend them if filed against the principal and to pursue it 
from the lower Court to the High Court. In the instant case 
the attorney has been authorized even to sell, bequeath the 
immovable property of the pre-emptors. Such a right tends 
to deprive the principal of his valuable rights in the 

 
7 
FAO No.83/2016 
 
 
immovable property. If the attorney has been given that 
much power there is no earthly reason as to why he should 
be deemed to be deprived of the power to file suit or appeal 
on behalf of his principal.”  
                                               (Emphasis supplied) 
Seeking guidance from the ratio laid down in case of Qadir Bakhsh 
supra, this Court is of the opinion that where a person is authorized by 
the principal (the respondent in the present case) to act as an attorney 
or an agent in respect of his property forming subject matter of the suit 
specified therein and the scope of such authority is described in an 
instrument, any incidental action of such attorney or agent is lawful. 
Similarly, in certain cases, the provisions of the Contract Act, 1872 
(“the Act, 1872”), inter alia, Section 197 are relevant, which confer the 
powers on the principal (the respondent in the instant case) to ratify acts 
of an agent, not expressly conferred on the agent and such a ratification 
can be either express or implied when the same is beneficial to the 
principal. Section 197 of the Act, 1872 reads as under:  
“197. 
Ratification may be expressed or implied. – 
Ratification may be expressed or may be implied in the 
conduct of the person on whose behalf the acts are done.”  
13. 
Having above legal position in sight, in respect of how a power 
of attorney is to be construed, it will appropriate to browse the contents 
of the special power of attorney (Exh.P/1), which reads as under:

Perusal of Exh.P-1 indicates that Haji Lal Hussain was appointed as 
special attorney on 12.11.2013. There is no doubt that, in recitals of the 
special power of attorney (Exh-P/1), titles of five different pending civil 
cases, pertaining to the property belonging to the respondent, have been 
mentioned and no reference has been made to the eviction petitions 
from which the present and connected appeal have emanated. However, 
this Court cannot lose sight of the fact that the eviction petitions, out of 
which present appeals have emanated were filed on 27.11.2013 and was 
allocated case No.ARC-68/2013 
and case No.ARC-67/2013, 
respectively. Certainly, in such an eventuality, the detail of future 
litigation cannot be reflected in the said document-Exh.P/1. There is also 
no denial to the fact that the cases reflected in the special power of 
attorney pertain to the property of which the rented premises are the part. 

 
9 
FAO No.83/2016 
 
 
The said power of attorney clearly envisages that the principal (i.e., the 
respondent) conferred the power to the special attorney, i.e., PW.1, to 
pursue the cases mentioned therein (05 civil suits) and also appear before 
the other Departments/Offices established by the Government of 
Pakistan (درگی ہمکحم اجت اقمئ رکدہ وکحتم اپاتسکن) and/or other Competent Authorities 
)(دیگر مجاز حکام. The Rent Tribunal-office of the Additional Rent 
Controller is a quasi-judicial Authority, established under the Act, 
comprising of an Executive Officer appointed by the Government of 
Pakistan, to resolve the disputes regarding the rent in respect of the 
demised premises situated in Cantonments of Pakistan. In this manner, 
it appears that the special power of attorney was not defective or 
limited, so as to curtail the power of the special attorney to act on behalf 
of the respondent for the purpose of watching his interest in respect of 
the property (of which the demised premises are part) and appear before 
the Additional Rent Controller, Cantonment to prosecute eviction 
petitions and lead evidence. In the present case, the eviction petitions 
were filed by the respondent himself whereafter the special attorney 
contested the same and the present appeals emanating therefrom 
remained pending for more than 11 years. The respondent never revoked 
and/or challenged the authority of the special attorney to represent him 
in the eviction petitions who is also defending the impugned orders 
passed by the Additional Rent Controller in these appeals, through 
counsel appointed by the special attorney. This is clearly a ratification 
of the special power of attorney executed by the respondent in favour 
of Haji Lal Hussian, to represent the respondent before the  
Additional Rent Controller, if not expressly but by the conduct. It does 
not lie in the mouth of the appellant to assail and/or challenge 
the special power of attorney. In this manner, the argument that the 
evidence led and got recorded by the special attorney, namely, Haji Lal 

 
10 
FAO No.83/2016 
 
 
Hussain on behalf of the respondent, has no evidentiary value is 
misconceived and hence, discarded.  
14. 
Adverting to the merits of the case, in present appeal, perusal of 
the record reveals that the documentary evidence brought on record by 
the respondent side are either public documents (sale deeds) or 
decisions of various Courts in favour of the respondent, which depict 
that he is owner of the property that includes the rented premises. The 
tenancy agreement was brought on record as Exh.P3 and the appellant 
outrightly denied affixation of his thumb impression, which proved 
otherwise, therefore, the Additional Rent Controller was justified to 
hold that the denial of the appellant regarding relationship was 
contumacious. It is settled principle of law that if relationship of 
landlord and tenant is denied by the respondent in an eviction petition, 
which subsequently proves to be false and concoction, he cannot be 
allowed to prove that he is not a defaulter as default in such a situation 
is in-built. This in itself reflects adversely on the appellant and his 
conduct who denied affixation of his thumb impression and denied 
execution of the tenancy agreement which stance turned out to be false.  
15. 
Insofar as connected appeal is concerned, perusal of record 
reveals that the appellant therein could not establish that above referred 
Ch. Muhammad Ishaq was his landlord as against the fact that 
ownership of the respondent, which is established by the record. In case 
titled “Shajar Islam v. Muhammad Siddique and 2 others” (PLD 2007 
SC 45), the Supreme Court of Pakistan held that if a person proves his 
title qua the rented premises and the occupant of the same cannot come 
up with a better title, then the latter is liable to be evicted. The ratio 
decidendi laid down in case of Shajar Islam supra is squarely 
applicable to the facts of the present case as the respondent has 
admittedly brought on record registered sale deeds in his favour 
whereas the appellant of the connected appeal failed to bring on record 

 
11 
FAO No.83/2016 
 
 
any document to prove the stance that Ch. Muhammad Ishaq was owner 
of the rented premises under whom the appellant claims to be tenant.   
16. 
The matter can be examined from another angle. It is case of the 
appellants that they are tenants under Ch. Muhammad Ishaq who 
admittedly lost civil litigation to the respondent. The appellants failed 
to bring on record any document or decision of Court of competent 
jurisdiction to establish that the respondent is not owner of the property 
of which rented premises are part. Furthermore, there is nothing on 
record to indicate that said Ch. Muhammad Ishaq made any effort to 
become party to the eviction petitions and oppose the same and only 
opted to appear as witness of the appellants. Even before this Court, 
said Ch. Muhammad Ishaq was arrayed as respondent No.2 in present 
appeal but he has shown no interest to contest the same. In fact, he was 
proceeded against ex-parte on 21.12.2022. It runs against the human 
conduct and logic that the title of the property owned by him (in present 
case, Ch Muhammad Ishaq), is obliquely under challenge and the 
possession thereof is under threat to be taken by his adversary (the 
respondent) in civil litigation through the initiation of the eviction 
proceedings but he remains aloof from the proceedings and does not 
make any effort to become party to the lis rather opts to enter the 
witness box merely as a witness and even has not assailed the impugned 
orders passed by the Additional Rent Controller. Holistically 
considered, these facts further substantiate that the denial of 
relationship of landlord and tenant by the appellants was self-
contradictory and proven to be false, and hence, cannot be 
countenanced.  
17. 
Despite arguing the case at length, learned counsel for the 
appellants has not been successful to point out any illegality, 
irregularity, misreading/non-reading of evidence or procedural 
impropriety in the impugned orders. No interference is warranted. As a 

 
12 
FAO No.83/2016 
 
 
corollary, both the appeals in hand have no merits. The same are 
accordingly dismissed.
