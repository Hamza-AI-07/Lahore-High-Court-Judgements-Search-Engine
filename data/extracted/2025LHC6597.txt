Additional District Judge etc. 
 
JUDGMENT 
 
 
 
 
Syed Ahsan Raza Kazmi, J. Through this writ petition, the 
petitioners have challenged the judgments and decrees dated 
31.03.2021 and 20.09.2021 passed by learned Courts below. 
2. 
The brief facts of the case are that the petitioner No.1 filed a 
suit for dissolution of marriage, recovery of maintenance allowance etc. 
against respondent No.3 before the learned Family Court which was 
contested by him through filing contesting written statement and the 
learned Family Court after framing of issues invited the parties to 
adduce their respective evidence which they produced and after 
appreciating the same, the suit of the petitioners was partly decreed vide 
judgment and decree dated 31.03.2021. 
3. 
Being aggrieved, both sides preferred their appeals before the 
learned Appellate Court. The respondent No.3 also filed an application 
for production of additional evidence before the learned Appellate 
Court. The learned Appellate Court dismissed the appeal filed by the 
petitioner whereas accepted the appeal along with application for 
production of additional evidence filed by the respondent No.3 vide 
judgment and decree dated 20.09.2021 and remanded the matter to the 
learned Family Court for decision afresh.

4. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that impugned 
judgments and decrees passed by the learned Courts below are illegal 
and unlawful and the learned Courts below remained fail to appreciate 
the evidence as well as material available on record in its true 
perspective and their decisions are based on misreading and non-
reading of evidence as well as material available on file, therefore, 
decisions are liable to be set aside. 
5. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent No.3 supported 
the impugned judgment and decree dated 20.09.2021 passed by the 
learned Appellate Court and prayed for dismissal of instant Writ 
Petition. 
6. 
I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the parties 
and perused the record.  
7. 
Before adverting to the merits, it would be prudent to elucidate 
the mechanism and requirements of the Family Courts Act, 1964 (the 
Act), to ensure a thorough understanding of the legal framework 
governing the dispute between the parties regarding the matrimonial 
issues, thereby facilitating a just and informed adjudication. 
8. 
Prior to the enactment of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 
1961, and the Act, cases related to maintenance/matrimonial issues 
were being handled by Civil or Criminal Courts, often resulting in 
prolonged proceedings and inadequate relief for women and minors. 
The Family Courts Act was promulgated to address these issues and to 
provide a more efficient and effective mechanism for resolving 
domestic disputes. In that context, the Act has undergone multiple 
amendments to prevent delaying tactics used by the parties and to 
ensure timely relief for affectees. 
9. 
The Family Courts Act, 1964, as declared in its preamble, was 
enacted “to make provision for the establishment of Family Courts for 
the expeditious settlement and disposal of disputes relating to marriage 

-3- 
                 W.P.No.16587 of 2021 
 
 
and family affairs and for matters connected therewith.” It is, therefore, 
a remedial and socially beneficent statute, animated by a legislative 
resolve that domestic conflicts must not be imprisoned in procedural 
rigidity but resolved through a humane, simplified, and time-bound 
process. The framework of the Act reinforces this intent at every stage. 
Section 9 ensures early production of relied-upon documents to avoid 
delay; Section 10 mandates completion of pleadings with expedition; 
Section 12-A obliges disposal of cases within six months, allowing 
supervisory recourse to the High Court in the event of delay; Section 14 
(4) requires that appeals be decided within four months; Section 17-A 
authorizes interim maintenance to alleviate immediate hardship; and 
Section 21-A empowers the Court to preserve and protect disputed 
property during pendency to prevent injustice. The Act further caps the 
right of appeal to one, ensuring finality and preventing protracted 
litigation. Furthermore, Family Courts are not required to adhere to the 
strict procedures of CPC and Qanun-e-Shahadat Order. 
Collectively, these provisions and scheme manifest a coherent 
legislative design that prioritizes substance over technicality and speed 
over formality, recognizing that delay in family litigation inflicts 
continuing harm upon women and minors whose welfare cannot await 
leisurely adjudication. The Family Court, therefore, stands not merely 
as a forum of trial but as a fiduciary of prompt and compassionate 
justice—bound by both law and equity to translate the legislative 
command of swift adjudication into practical reality. 
10. 
It is well-settled that Family Courts possess the discretion to 
accept additional evidence where the ends of justice so require, subject 
to reasonable restrictions and safeguards that ensure fairness to both 
parties. Sections 9(2) and 9(4) of the Family Courts Act, 1964, obligate 
defendants to produce and share all relied-upon documents with the 
plaintiff along with the written statement. However, as the statute 
prescribes no penal consequence for non-compliance, these provisions 
are directory rather than mandatory, vesting the Family Court with 

-4- 
                 W.P.No.16587 of 2021 
 
 
judicial discretion to permit late filing or production of documents. Yet, 
such discretion is not unfettered; it must be exercised judiciously, in 
furtherance of justice and the legislative object, considering the 
relevancy of the document, the cause for delay, and the absence of 
prejudice to the opposing side. 
11. 
The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has underscored the 
importance of adopting a purposive and liberal interpretive approach 
toward family statutes. The law must be construed to advance the object 
of social welfare, not to obstruct it through procedural formalism. 
Accordingly, Family Courts should interpret their enabling statute in a 
manner that fosters substantive justice, promotes expeditious relief, and 
prevents technicalities from defeating legitimate claims. 
12. 
Reverting to the present case, the record reveals that the 
petitioners instituted a suit for recovery of maintenance, dower, and 
dowry articles on 20.07.2018. The respondent entered appearance on 
02.11.2018 and, after multiple adjournments, filed his written statement 
on 13.12.2018. Issues were framed on 03.04.2019, and the petitioners’ 
oral evidence was recorded on 15.04.2019. The matter was thereafter 
adjourned for cross-examination and documentary evidence, yet despite 
repeated opportunities, the respondent failed to adduce his evidence, 
resulting in closure of his right under order dated 31.03.2021. 
Subsequently, after hearing arguments, the learned Family Court 
decreed the suit, holding as under: 
Marriage of the parties was dissolved subject to surrender 
of 25% of prompt and 50% of deferred dower if any by the 
petitioner No.1 and holding her entitled to recover 
maintenance allowance @ Rs.5,000/- per month for iddat 
period, delivery expenses @ Rs.30,000/- and to receive 
Rs.250,000/-as alternate price of the dowry articles besides 
entitling petitioner No.2 to receive his  maintenance 
allowance @ Rs.5,000/- per month with 10% annual 
increase subject to deduction of amount of interim 
maintenance.

13. 
Both sides challenged the said decree in appeal. Respondent 
No.3 sought to set aside the decree, while the petitioner filed for 
enhancement/modification. Alongside the appeal, the respondent No.3 
submitted an application for production of an Acknowledgment Deed 
dated 05.10.2019 as additional evidence regarding dowry articles, 
which was allowed by the appellate court. The appellate court 
consequently remanded the case to the trial court while dismissing the 
appeal filed by petitioner. 
14. 
A careful appraisal of the impugned appellate judgment reveals 
that the appellate court erred in setting aside the trial court’s well-
reasoned order closing the respondent’s right of documentary 
evidence without recording any valid justification. Judicial orders 
must be speaking and self-explanatory, demonstrating application of 
mind to the facts and law. Reliance on mere assumption or perceived 
relevance of a document—without articulating reasons—renders the 
order arbitrary and legally infirm. Parties who bring their disputes 
before courts are entitled to reasoned adjudication that reflects a 
conscious and lawful exercise of judicial power. 
15. 
The respondent’s attempt to introduce the Acknowledgment 
Deed belatedly raises serious doubts about its authenticity and bona 
fides. It is contrary to logic and human conduct that the respondent 
would voluntarily return dowry articles without court supervision 
while the matter was still pending trial. Such conduct casts grave 
suspicion on the genuineness of the alleged document and undermines 
the credibility of the respondent’s plea. 
16. 
The record further discloses that the Acknowledgment Deed 
was executed on 05.10.2019, prior to recording of evidence, yet the 
respondent neither produced it during trial nor confronted the 
petitioner’s witnesses with it. Even in his own evidence (Exh.D1)1 and 
(Exh.D2)2 he admits that some dowry articles remained in his 
                                                 
1 Para 5 of affidavit of respondent No.3. 
2 Para 5 of affidavit of mother of respondent No.3.

possession, thereby contradicting his stance and weakening his 
defence. This omission corroborates the inference that the document 
was an afterthought. Furthermore, it is a settled principle that one 
cannot do indirectly what is prohibited directly. In this case, 
respondent No. 3 had multiple opportunities to produce documentary 
evidence but failed to do so, leading the Family Court to close his 
right to do so. The application for additional evidence appears to be an 
attempt to circumvent this order. The Appellate Court's acceptance of 
said application is erroneous in law. 
17. 
The appellate court also fell into error in entertaining the appeal 
filed by respondent No.3 against the maintenance decree, as Section 
14(2)(c) of the Family Courts Act, 1964, expressly bars appeals 
against maintenance decrees not exceeding Rs.5,000/-, rendering the 
appellate court’s findings on this issue void ab initio. 
18. 
In light of the above discussion, it is evident that the Appellate 
Court's judgment and decree are flawed. However, rather than 
remanding the matter yet again, this Court deems it appropriate to 
decide the petition on merits, ensuring speedy disposal in accordance 
with the legislative intent of the Family Courts Act, 1964, which aims 
to avoid repetitive remands and procedural delays. 
19. 
From perusal of judgment and decree passed by the learned trial 
court it can safely be observed that the Family Court's judgment and 
decree is well-founded, considering the evidence and financial status 
of the parties involved. The respondent No.3, as a father, is indeed 
legally and morally obligated to maintain petitioner No.2/minor. The 
maintenance allowance granted by the family Court is reasonable, and 
the decree regarding dowry articles is justified, given the admission of 
respondent No.3 having the dowry articles in his possession. The 
alternate amount of the dowry articles, along with delivery 
expenditure, was also correctly granted by the Family Court.

20. 
Resultantly, this Writ Petition is allowed. The impugned 
judgment and decree of the Appellate Court are set aside, and the 
judgment and decree of the learned Family Court are hereby restored 
and upheld.
