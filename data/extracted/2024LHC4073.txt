the  petitioner.

Attorney General for Pakistan.  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Through this constitutional petition, the 
petitioner has challenged the  appointment of 
respondent No.3 as Member of National Tariff 
Commission (NTC), Islamabad vide notification 
dated 30.8.2023 and his appointment as Chairman 
of NTC, Islamabad for period of five years or till 
attaining the age of 65 years whichever is earlier 
vide separate notification dated 30.8.2023. The 
petitioner has also challenged the order dated 
04.5.2024 passed under section 63 of the Anti 
Dumping Duties Act, 2015 (Act).

W.P.No.57829/2024 
2. 
Learned Law Officer at the very outset raised 
preliminary objection to the maintainability of this 
petition before this Court on the touchstone of 
territorial jurisdiction. He submits that respondent 
No.3 being appointed by the Federal Government 
and posted as Chairman NTC at Islamabad, this 
constitutional petition is not maintainable at Lahore 
due to lack of territorial jurisdiction and petitioner 
may approach Islamabad High Court, Islamabad. He 
further submits that the impugned order dated 
04.5.2024 being passed by the Commission at 
Islamabad may also be assailed before Islamabad 
High Court in view of the order dated 28.6.2024 in 
Writ Petition No.3965/2023 titled “M/S Madni 
Paper Mart, through its Proprietor Irshad Ahmad 
and another vs. Federation of Pakistan etc”. He 
also placed reliance on Sandalbar Enterprises (Pvt.) 
Ltd vs. Central Board of Revenue and others (PLD 
1997 Supreme Court 334).  
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner in response 
to the preliminary objection submits that respondent 
No.3 is Chairman of NTC, which has jurisdiction all 
over Pakistan, therefore, this constitutional petition 

3 
W.P.No.57829/2024 
by way of quo warranto can be filed against him in 
any of the High Court of Pakistan including before 
this Court at Lahore. He placed reliance on 
judgment of this Court dated 24.10.2016 titled 
“Shahid 
Mehmood 
Khan 
vs. 
Federation 
of 
Pakistan” passed in Writ Petition No.18698/2016 
and judgment dated 28.11.2017 titled “Musa Raza 
vs. Federation of Pakistan etc “passed in Writ 
Petition No.1091-P of 2017 by Peshawar High 
Court, Peshawar. He 
however submits that 
petitioner do not press this petition to the extent of 
impugned order dated 04.5.2024 passed under 
section 63 of the Act in these proceedings. 
4. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. Before 
touching merits of the case, lest it may prejudice 
case of either party, I would like to decide the 
threshold question of territorial jurisdiction of this 
Court. In this writ petition, relevant facts which are 
discernible from the available record are that the 
petitioner has mainly challenged the two separate 
notifications 
dated 
30.8.2023 
(impugned 
notifications), whereby respondent No.3 was 
appointed as Member and then Chairman NTC, 

4 
W.P.No.57829/2024 
Islamabad. 
Though 
the 
petitioner 
has 
also 
challenged the order dated 04.5.2024 issued under 
section 63 of the Act, however, learned counsel for 
the petitioner does not press this petition to the 
extent of aforesaid order dated 04.5.2024 (which is 
otherwise passed by National Tariff Commission 
under section 63(4) of the Act and not by 
respondent No.3 in his individual capacity). In the 
light of aforesaid facts, the moot question require 
determination is that whether this Court at Lahore 
has territorial jurisdiction to proceed with this 
constitutional petition filed by way of quo warranto 
or jurisdiction lies with the Islamabad High Court. 
5. 
The writ of quo warranto is filed under 
Article 199(1)(b)(ii) of the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (Constitution). To 
facilitate an easy analysis, aforesaid article is 
reproduced hereunder:- 
199.(1) Subject to the Constitution, a High 
Court may, if it is satisfied that no other 
adequate remedy is provided by law,- 
 
----------------------------------------- 
(b) 
on the application of any person, make 
an order-- 
 
 
----------------------------------------- 

5 
W.P.No.57829/2024 
 
(ii) 
requiring 
a 
person 
within 
the 
territorial jurisdiction of the Court holding or 
purporting to hold a public office to show 
under what authority of law he claims to hold 
that office; or 
The language of aforesaid article is explicit, 
according to which, the High Court may if it is 
satisfied that there is no other adequate remedy 
provided by law on the application of any person, 
make an order requiring the person within the 
territorial jurisdiction of the Court holding or 
purporting to hold public office to show under what 
authority of law, he claims to hold that office. The 
words “within the territorial jurisdiction of the 
Court holding or purporting to hold public office” 
would lead to the ineluctable conclusion that for the 
purpose of writ of quo warranto, a person against 
whom, constitutional petition has been filed, must 
be holding or purporting to hold public office within 
a territorial jurisdiction of that Court. In the present 
case, admittedly respondent No.3 is holding the post 
of Member and Chairman NTC at Islamabad and 
not holding or purporting to hold a public office 
within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court in 
Province of Punjab.

W.P.No.57829/2024 
6. 
The same view was also expressed by 
Division Bench of Balochistan High Court in Mirza 
Luqman Masud vs. Government of Pakistan etc 
(2015 PLC (C.S.) 526), while interpreting Article 
199(1)(b)(ii) of the Constitution. Relevant parts of 
the judgment are reproduced hereunder:- 
“We have heard the learned counsel at length 
and have gone through the petition. Before attending 
the contentions raised by the learned counsel, it 
would be advantageous to reproduce the relevant 
provision of the Constitution. Article 199 of the 
Constitution provides the jurisdiction of the High 
Court and its sub-clauses (1)(b) (ii) is related to the 
writ quo warranto, which stipulates as under:--- 
  
            "requiring a person within the territorial 
jurisdiction of the court holding or purporting to hold 
a public office to show under what authority of law 
he claims to hold that office:" 
  
            The jurisdiction of this court has been invoked 
for relief of quo warranto against the respondents 
Nos.6 to 15, but the above referred provision of the 
Constitution clearly mentions "within the territorial 
jurisdiction of the court". The High Court under 
Article 199 of the Constitution enjoys ample powers, 
but it is mandatory upon the High Court to confine 
itself to its jurisdiction as provided in the 
Constitution. The High Court is competent to direct 
any person performing functions in connection with 
the affairs of the Federation, Province or a Local 
authority to refrain from doing anything, which he is 
not permitted by law or to do anything by law he is 
required to do, as well as, in terms of writ of quo-
warranto, to call upon anyone that under what 
authority of law he/she holds or purported to hold the 
public office, but within its territorial jurisdiction 
only and not otherwise. 
  
It is suffice to mention here that the 
respondents 
were 
appointed 
by 
the 
NAB 
headquarters in Islamabad, and have never served 
within the territorial jurisdiction of this court. They 
therefore cannot be called upon by this Court in 
terms of writ of quo-warranto to explain under what 
authority of law they are holding the offices as it will 

7 
W.P.No.57829/2024 
amount to transgression of the constitutional 
authority of this High Court. 
 
 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Moreover, the petitioner has also failed to 
satisfy us that we can exercise jurisdiction against 
the respondents, who were neither appointed nor 
carrying out their duties within the territorial 
jurisdictions of this Court. It may be clarified that the 
respondents are not holding any post created by the 
Constitution of Pakistan and performing functions 
within the territory of the Province or which includes 
the Province in respect whereby the High Court 
could exercise jurisdiction. 
  
Thus, the petition is dismissed in limine being 
not maintainable”. 
 
7. 
The Supreme Court in case of Sandalbar 
supra on the question of territorial jurisdiction held 
that Court is to see what is the dominant object of 
filing of writ petition. Relevant part of the judgment 
is reproduced hereunder:- 
“A perusal of the above sub-clause (a)(i) of 
the above Article indicates that a High Court 
has power to issue a direction to a person 
performing within its territorial jurisdiction 
functions in connection with the affairs of the 
Federation, a Province or a local authority to 
refrain from doing anything he is not 
permitted by law to do or to do anything he is 
required by law to do. Similarly, under sub-
clause (a)(ii) a declaration without law 
authority or of no legal effect can be given by 
a High Court in respect of any act done or 
proceeding 
taken 
within 
its 
territorial 
jurisdiction by a person performing functions 
in connection with the affairs of the 
Federation, a Province or a local authority. 
 
The petitioners’ prayer was for a 
direction to the Customs Authority at Karachi 
not to levy the regulatory duty. The above 
relief could have been granted by the High 

8 
W.P.No.57829/2024 
Court of Sindh within whose jurisdiction the 
person 
performing 
the 
affairs 
of 
the 
Federation is discharging his functions. 
 
We may observe that it has become a 
common practice to file a writ petition either 
at Peshawar, or Lahore, or Rawalpindi or 
Multan etc, to challenge the order of 
assessment passed at Karachi by adding a 
ground for impugning the notification under 
which a particular levy is imposed. This 
practice is to be depreciated. The court is to 
see, what is the dominant object of filing of 
the writ petition. In the present case, the 
dominant object was not to pay the regulatory 
duty assessed by a Customs official at 
Karachi. We are, therefore, not inclined to 
grant leave. Leave is refused”.   
In present case, the dominant object is to challenge 
the impugned notifications whereby the respondent 
No.3 has been appointed by Federal Government as  
Member and Chairman NTC, Islamabad. Neither 
impugned notifications were issued by Punjab 
Government nor respondent No.3 is holding a 
public office in the Province of Punjab. Therefore, 
the dominant object of this writ petition being at 
Islamabad and not Lahore, this constitutional 
petition is not maintainable before this Court on this 
score as well.   
8. 
Even 
otherwise, 
the 
term 
“performing 
functions within the territorial jurisdiction of the 
Court” used in Article 199(1)(a)(i),(ii) and (c) of the 

9 
W.P.No.57829/2024 
Constitution, is much wider term then words 
“holding or purporting to hold public office within 
territorial jurisdiction” used in Article 199(1)(b)(ii) 
of the Constitution. A person may perform functions 
within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court, even 
if, he is not holding public office within the 
territorial 
jurisdiction 
of 
said 
Court, 
hence 
constitutional petition may be maintainable in said 
Court considering the dominant object for filing of 
writ petition, however, in case of writ of             
quo-warranto under Article 199(1)(b)(ii) of the 
Constitution, a person must hold or purported to 
hold public office within territorial jurisdiction of 
Court, where constitutional petition has been filed.  
9. 
The case law relied upon by learned counsel 
for the petitioner is distinguishable. The case of 
Shahid Mahmood Khan supra was not a writ of    
quo-warranto rather in said case the petitioner for 
his 
personal 
grievance 
has 
challenged 
his 
termination order against the post of Chairman NTC 
at Lahore, however, his writ petition was dismissed 
on merits. In the case of Musa Raza supra, though 
appointment 
of 
Chairman 
NTC 
was 
under 

10 
W.P.No.57829/2024 
challenged, however, in said case, the question of 
territorial jurisdiction was neither raised nor 
discussed or adjudicated. On the other hand, the 
case of M/S Madni Paper Mart supra relied upon by 
learned Law Officer is relevant and also support the 
preliminary objection on the question of territorial 
jurisdiction.  
10. 
In view of above discussion, this Court is of 
the considered view that territorial jurisdiction with 
regard to the instant matter lies with the Islamabad 
High Court, Islamabad and this Court lacks 
territorial jurisdiction under Article 199(1)(b)(ii) of 
the 
Constitution, 
thus 
not 
maintainable. 
Consequently, office is directed to return the 
petition to the petitioner in terms of Order VII Rule 
10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC)  so 
as to present before the Court concerned (Islamabad 
High Court, Islamabad), if so advised.
