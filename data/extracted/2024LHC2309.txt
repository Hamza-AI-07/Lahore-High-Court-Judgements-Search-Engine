Through this petition, filed under 
section 497 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 
(‘Cr.P.C’), the petitioner seeks post-arrest bail in case 
FIR No. 09/2023 dated 03.06.2023 registered under 
sections 420, 468, 471, 161, 162, 34 PPC, read with 
section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 
at Police Station ACE, Lahore (the ‘FIR’). 
 
   
2.  
 
Allegedly the FIR was lodged after 
inquiry conducted with respect to inductions against 
different posts in the Punjab Assembly, in pursuance 
of advertisement dated 26.05.2021. As per the 
allegations, the petitioner headed meeting of the 
departmental selection committee on 09.08.2021 when 
the result of written examination of the individuals 
named in the FIR was changed by committing forgery. 
The petitioner applied for his post-arrest bail on 
05.06.2023 which was conditionally granted by the 
learned D&SJ / Special Judge, Anti-Corruption, 
Lahore (the ‘Anti-Corruption Court’) and later upon 
failure of condition the same was recalled vide order 

 
 
 
Crl. Misc. No. 20737/B of 2024  
 
2 
 
 
dated 11.10.2023. This Court on 07.11.2023 dismissed 
the petition No. 69172 of 2023 and at the same time it 
was observed that in the peculiar circumstances of the 
case, the petitioner is not precluded from filing fresh 
application before the learned concerned Court. 
Consequently, the present petitioner approached the 
learned Anti-Corruption Court on 13.03.2024 seeking 
post-arrest bail, which was dismissed vide order dated 
27.03.2024. 
 
   
3.  
 
Mr. Amir Saeed Rawn, learned counsel 
for the petitioner has submitted that the petitioner is 
about eighty years old citizen of the Country and 
deserves the concession of bail, as this Court in several 
cases has released the accused persons on this ground. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner has relied on cases 
titled “Alam Khan and Others Versus The State” 
(2022 P Cr. LJ 338) and “Mehboob Hassan Versus 
Akhtar Islam and Others” (2024 SCMR 757) and he 
has stated that alleged recovery of Rs. 4,100,000/- is of 
no help to the prosecution because number of the 
currency notes or specifications are neither given in the 
FIR nor it is mentioned in the recovery memorandum, 
thus, at this stage, no benefit of such recovery can be 
given. Learned counsel for the petitioner has added 
that though the allegation in the FIR attracts the 
prohibitory clause of section 497 Cr.P.C  but 
prosecution, even at this stage, is required to show 
sufficient material / evidence, constituting reasonable 
grounds that the accused has committed an offence 
falling within the prohibitory limb of the above 
provision; that the burden is not on the petitioner in 
this regard. He further stated that accused can only 
show that evidence collected and relied by the 
prosecution itself creates a reasonable doubt in the 

 
 
 
Crl. Misc. No. 20737/B of 2024  
 
3 
 
 
prosecution case and upon showing the same the 
petitioner is entitled to the benefit. He then contended 
that in the FIR forgery is attributed to the petitioner, 
during committee meeting which was held on 
09.08.2021, whereas, the result of the inducted persons 
named in the FIR, was published by Open Testing 
Service (‘OTS’) on the website on 29.07.2021 and 
interview letters were issued on 30.07.2021, thus, the 
allegation of forgery on 09.08.2021 ex facie is 
implausible. 
 
   
4.  
 
Conversely, Mr. Abdul Samad, learned 
Additional 
Prosecutor 
General 
has 
vehemently 
opposed this petition. He has contended that the deeper 
appreciation is not permissible at this stage. He relied 
upon case titled “Imtiaz Ahmed and another Versus 
The State” (PLD 1997 Supreme Court 545) and 
stated that petitioner has committed an offence 
detriment to the society being holder of a public office; 
that in the given circumstances approach should be 
reformation-oriented with the desire to suppress the 
mischieves. In course of arguments, learned Additional 
Prosecutor General has also relied upon case titled 
“Mst. Bashiran Bibi Versus Nisar Ahmad Khan and 
Others” (PLD 1990 Supreme Court 83). Learned 
Additional Prosecutor General has vigorously argued 
that it is upon the petitioner / accused to show 
reasonable grounds for believing that the petitioner is 
not involved in a case falling within the prohibitory 
clause. Learned Additional Prosecutor General has 
much focused on the gravity of offence and stated that 
in such offences bail should be refused.

6.  
 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan in cases 
titled “Salman Mushtaq and Others Versus The State 
through P.G. Punjab and another” (2024 SCMR 14), 
“Zaigham Ashraf Versus The State and Others” (2016 
SCMR 18) and “Tariq Bashir and 5 Others Versus 
The State” (PLD 1995 Supreme Court 34) has 
already settled that the expression 
reasonable 
ground(s) as contained under section 497 of Cr. P.C. 
obligates the prosecution to unveil sufficient material 
or evidence to disclose that the accused has committed 
the offence falling within the prohibitory clause  and 
when the prosecution fails to satisfy the Court that the 
reasonable ground(s) do exist to believe that accused 
is guilty of such offence, then the Court can release 
accused person(s) on bail. It is also settled that for 
ascertaining the  existence of reasonable ground(s) 
that accused is guilty of offence punishable with death, 
imprisonment of life or with ten years imprisonment, 
the Court cannot conduct a preliminary trial but will 
only make a tentative assessment. In case titled 
“Manzoor and 4 Others Versus The State” (PLD 1972 
Supreme Court 81) the Supreme Court observed that 
it must be remembered that bail is not to be withheld 
as a punishment and there is no legal or moral 
compulsion to keep people in jail merely for the fact 
that the allegations against them are punishable with 
death or with imprisonment as indicated in prohibitory 
clause. It will be beneficial to reproduce the relevant 
paragraph of the said judgment:- 
   
 
 “It is important to remember that bail 
is not to be withheld as a punishment. 
There is no legal or moral compulsion to 
keep people in jail merely on the 
allegation that they have committed 
offences 
punishable 
with 
death 
or 
transportation, 
unless 
reason-able 

 
 
 
Crl. Misc. No. 20737/B of 2024  
 
5 
 
 
grounds appear to exist to disclose their 
complicity. The ultimate conviction and 
incarceration of a guilty person can 
repair the wrong caused by a mistaken 
relief of interim bail granted to him, but 
no satisfactory reparation can be offered 
to an innocent man for his unjustified 
incarceration at any stage of the case 
albeit his acquittal in the long run.” 
   
7.  
 
In order to show the existence of 
reasonable grounds, the prosecution has relied upon 
the recovery allegedly effected from the petitioner and 
one of his co-accused namely Muhammad Khan 
Bhatti. It is stated by the learned Additional Prosecutor 
General that vide recovery memorandum dated 
22.10.2023, duly witnessed by police / officers of the 
establishment, co-accused person / Muhammad Khan 
Bhatti got recovered laptop, whereas, the petitioner  
got recovered Rs. 4,100,000/- from his house vide 
recovery memorandum dated 27.10.2023. Learned 
Additional Prosecutor General at this juncture was 
asked to show from the record if currency notes 
allegedly recovered have any specification or special 
marks so that, prior to trial, recovery of unspecified 
cash can be considered as a reasonable ground as 
necessitated under section 497 of the Cr.P.C.; the 
learned Additional Prosecutor General has not given 
any answer. Admittedly, the allegation in the FIR is 
that the departmental selection committee, headed by 
Ch. Pervaiz Elahi / the petitioner, on 09.08.2021 has 
made some changes or committed forgery in the 
written test, however, no denial, based on plausible 
explanation, could be made by the prosecution that 
result was announced by OTS on the website on 
29.07.2021 i.e. much prior to the alleged date of 
forgery. The delay of about two years in lodging the 
case also went unexplained by the respondent-side.

8.  
 
Now turning to argument of Mr. Abdul 
Samad as to the gravity of the offence. I am of the 
opinion that heinousness or gravity of offence or mere 
possibility that ultimately the accused person can be 
punished with ten years imprisonment, by itself is not 
sufficient to divest this Court from the discretion to 
grant after arrest bail specifically when the case is one 
of further inquiry. Moreover, in case titled “Chairman, 
National Accountability Bureau through P.G., NAB 
Versus Nisar Ahmed Pathan and Others” (PLD 2022 
Supreme Court 475) the Supreme Court also has 
observed that when two opinions can be reasonably 
formed on the basis of the material before the Court 
and both of them more or less pass the test of 
plausibility and none of them can be termed as 
perverse opinion then the one favourable to accused 
person should be preferred; to err in granting bail is 
better to err in declining it as the ultimate conviction 
and sentence of a guilty person can repair the wrong 
caused by a mistaken relief of bail but no satisfactory 
reparation can be offered to an innocent person on his 
acquittal for unjustified imprisonment during the trial. 
   
9.  
 
Further reference can be made to the cases 
titled “Khalid Saigol Versus The State” (PLD 1962 
Supreme Court 495) and “Husnain Mustafa Versus 
The State and another” (2019 SCMR 1914). It will be 
advantageous to reproduce the relevant part from 
“Khalid Saigol” case (supra), which reads as under:- 
 
“It will be observed that even under 
section 497 (1) in the case of an offence 
punishable with death or transportation 
for life the mere heinousness of the 
offence is not by itself a circumstance 
sufficient to take away the discretion of a 
Court to grant bail but in addition thereto 
there must also exist reasonable grounds 

 
 
 
Crl. Misc. No. 20737/B of 2024  
 
7 
 
 
for believing that the person seeking bail 
has been guilty of such an offence. 
Subsection (1) of section 497 evidently 
applies to a stage where the accused is 
first brought before the Court or his 
arrest is brought to the notice of the 
Court and, as such, the Court is not 
called upon at that stage to conduct 
anything in the nature of a preliminary 
trial to consider the probability of the 
accused's guilt or innocence. It has, 
nevertheless, as a necessary part of its 
functions, namely, to ascertain as to 
whether there exist any reasonable 
grounds upon which its belief can be 
founded, to look at the materials placed 
before it by the investigating agency and 
be prima facie satisfied that some 
tangible evidence can be offered which, if 
left unrebutted, may lead to the inference 
of guilt before it can come to the 
conclusion that its discretion no longer 
exists.” 
 
10.  
 
I have found that the case against the 
petitioner calls for further inquiry into his guilt. This petition 
is, therefore, allowed. The petitioner /  Ch. Pervaiz Elahi is 
admitted to after arrest bail in the above case subject to 
furnishing bail bond in the sum of Rs. 500,000/- (rupees five 
hundred thousand only) with two sureties each in the like 
amount to the satisfaction of the learned trial Court.  
11.  
 
Before parting with this order, I would like 
to observe that the observations made above are tentative and 
same shall not be considered at the time of the trial.
