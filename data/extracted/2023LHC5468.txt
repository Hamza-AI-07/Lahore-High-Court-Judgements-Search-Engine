JAWAD HASSAN, J. By way of this petition under Article 
199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the 
“Constitution”), the Petitioner has challenged Clause-6 of Standing 
Operating Procedure (SOP) dated 21.09.2022 (the “SOP”) issued by 
Director Food Punjab, Lahore which reads as: 
“No wheat quota to any flour mill will be 
issued during the days of Army grinding”. 
 
I. 
BRIEF BACKGROUND 
2. 
Brief facts for the disposal of this petition are that Al-Khalid 
Flour Mills (the “Petitioner Mill”) holds license under the Foodgrains 
(Licensing Control) Order, 1957 for purchase, grinding, sale or 
storage of foodgrains and manufacturer of value-added products. It 
grinds subsidized wheat in terms of policy of Government of Punjab 
according to permitted quota per day which allows the “Petitioner 
Mill” to grind private wheat including Pakistan Army quota. The 
“Petitioner Mill” entered into a contract with the Government of 
Pakistan, Ministry of Defence Production, Directorate General 
Procurement (Army), Rawalpindi as per wheat release milling policy

2 
2022-2023 dated 19.09.2022 (the “Policy”) and is aggrieved of 
Clause-6 of the “SOP” whereby wheat quota of the “Petitioner Mill” 
has been restricted during the days of army grinding.   
II. 
ARGUMENTS OF PARTIES  
3. 
Malik Qamar Afzal, ASC inter alia argues that clause-6 of the 
“SOP” is ultra vires to the “Policy” and infringes fundamental rights 
of trade and business as envisaged under Article 18 of the 
“Constitution”; that the “Petitioner Mill” was allowed to grind 
private wheat stock subject to condition stipulated in Clause-2 of the 
“Policy” but impugned clause-6 of the “SOP” restricts the 
“Petitioner Mill” to grind defence wheat which is also violative to 
previous policies dated 19.09.2021 and 19.05.2022; that the 
“Petitioner Mill” is under contract with Director General 
Procurement (Army), Rawalpindi read with Official Secrets Act, 1923 
and is obligated not to disclose the grinding capacity of the army 
wheat quota/quantity etc; that the “SOP” issued by the Respondent 
No.2 lacks sanction of the Respondent No.1/Secretary Food 
Department. He has relied on “SUI NORTHERN GAS PIPELINES 
LIMITED through Authorized Attorney versus FEDERATION OF 
PAKISTAN through Secretary, Ministry of Energy (Petroleum 
Division) and another” (2022 MLD 1158). 
4. 
Conversely, Law Officer filed report and parawise comments 
according to which, though no restriction on private grinding has been 
imposed upon the flour mills and they are at liberty to grind private 
wheat stock yet they are bound to submit monthly grinding schedule 
to the District Food Control approved by the Ministry of Defence 
Production, Directorate General Procurement Army, Rawalpindi for 
issuance of subsidized wheat quota under the “Policy”. It has been 
stated that the “Petitioner Mill” has failed to provide requisite 
information in terms of the “SOP” and letter dated 22.09.2022 issued 
by the Respondent No.2 and permission for private grinding from the 
concerned OC CMF of Army. It has been argued on behalf of the 
Respondents that the Government of Punjab has no objection upon 
issuance of quota of wheat to the “Petitioner Mill” if required

information is provided and in absence of such information, it is 
impossible for monitoring the grinding process and supply of wheat 
provided by the Government of Punjab at subsidized rates. 
III. 
DETERMINATION BY THE COURT 
5. 
The sole ground agitated by the “Petitioner Mill” is that 
clause-6 of the “SOP” patently contradicts to the “Policy” and also 
the “SOP” issued by the Respondent No.2/Director Food Punjab 
lacks sanction of the Respondent No.1/Secretary Food Department. 
Pertinently, Director Food, Punjab is the head of attached department 
of Food Department and falls under First Schedule, Column-III, 
Sr.No.12 of the Punjab Government Rules of Business, 2011 (the 
“Rules”). The Food Department has the mandate to legislate, 
formulate policy and plan as a measure of food security through wheat 
procurement, 
construction 
and 
maintenance 
of 
storage 
accommodation, storage of wheat, financial arrangements with the 
banks, transportation of wheat and release of wheat and its overall 
monitoring. For the release of wheat stock available and to ensure its 
uninterrupted supply and stabilization of its price in market, the Food 
Department introduced the “Policy” under Section 3 of the Punjab 
Foodstuffs (Control) Act, 1958 with certain terms and conditions 
specifically Clause-III, which entitles the flour mills to grind private 
wheat stock, reads as: 
“VIII.    Flour mills getting wheat from Punjab Food 
Department shall also be entitled to grind their 
private wheat stocks. Flour mills getting wheat from 
Punjab Food Department shall be bound to deliver 
minimum 25% flour obtained from their private 
wheat stocks in their respective Districts”. 
 
Underlying for emphases 
6. 
The above clause clearly demonstrates that no restriction was 
imposed upon the flour mills on the private grinding but with only 
condition to deliver 25% of flour obtained from private wheat stocks 
in their respective districts. Pursuant to issuance of the “Policy” by the 
Secretary Food Department, the Director Food Punjab, in order to 
ensure proper monitoring with regard to grinding of Government

wheat, its production and supply to flour mills, issued the “SOP” 
which reads as under:  
1. 
The concerned flour mill, will submit monthly 
grinding schedule to concerned District Food 
Controller (DFC), duly approved by the 
concerned authority of Pakistan Army (OC 
CFM). This schedule must be in accordance 
with the Agreement between the mill and Pak 
Army (OC CFM). 
2. 
After completion of required quota of Army 
grinding during a month in accordance with 
the timelines/grinding schedule under the 
Agreement between the flour mill and Pakistan 
Army (OC DFM), concerned DFC may release 
daily wheat quota only for the remaining 
working days of the specific month excluding 
holidays. 
3. 
Before the release of daily wheat quota, 
concerned DFC will personally take/record 
reading of electricity meter. 
4. 
Before start of next grinding schedule for the 
next month issued by the concerned authority 
of Pakistan Army, DFC will again record/take 
electricity reading to access the justification of 
further grinding of Government wheat. 
5. 
DFC will also keep the record of Army 
grinding and Government grinding separately 
in up-to-date condition. 
6. 
No wheat quota to any flour mill will be issued 
during the days of Army grinding. 
7. 
All other instructions under the Wheat Release 
Policy 2022-2023, as per the Notification 
No.S.O(F)3-46(W.E.) dated 20/09/2022, will 
remain the same and apply. 
 
7. 
Bare reading of above clauses reveals that the flour mills 
grinding private wheat for the Army, are bound to submit monthly 
grinding schedule to the concerned District Food Controller duly 
approved by the Ministry of Defence for the issuance of subsidized 
wheat quota from the Government of Punjab under the “SOP”. It is 
also evident from above said clauses that daily wheat quota will only 
be issued by the District Food Controller for the working days of the 
specific month excluding holidays after completion of required quota 
of Army grinding during a month in terms of schedule under the 
Agreement and that too the concerned District Food Controller, will 

 
Writ Petition No.3042 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
5 
personally record the reading of electricity meter before the release of 
daily wheat quota and will keep the record of Army and Government 
grinding separately. It is specifically stated in under challenged 
Clause-6 of the “SOP” that no wheat quota to any flour mill during 
the days of Army grinding will be issued while Clause-7 clearly states 
that other instructions as per the “Notification” will remain the same. 
It is crystal clear from bare reading of the “SOP” that quota of 
subsidized wheat will only be issued by the Government to the 
licensed flour mills after complying with the “SOP”. 
8. 
When confronted whether the “Petitioner Mill” has complied 
with the terms of “SOP” for the release of subsidized quota, Malik 
Qamar Afzal, ASC, stated that as the “Petitioner Mill” is under 
contract for grinding wheat with Directorate General Procurement 
(Army), Rawalpindi, Ministry of Defence Production, Government of 
Pakistan and under clear terms of the agreement, is not authorized to 
provide any information about defence wheat being grinded. While on 
the other hand, the counsel for the Respondents states that clauses of 
the “SOP” put no restriction upon the “Petitioner Mill” on private 
grinding of wheat stock rather Clauses 2 and 39 of the Agreement 
executed between the “Petitioner Mill” and Government of Pakistan, 
Ministry of Defence Production, Directorate General Procurement 
Army, Rawalpindi, grant permission on private grinding. He has also 
pointed out that two flour mills namely M/s Baddar Flour Mill, 
District Sheikhupura and M/s Al-Jehan Flour Mill, District Multan are 
also engaged in grinding of Army wheat but they had provided the 
requisite information and permission from the concerned OC CMF of 
Pakistan Army for the issuance of subsidized wheat quota in terms of 
the “SOP”. It is also evident from the statement made by Muhammad 
Shoaib, District Food Controller, Attock on 02.11.2022 that 
Government of Punjab has no objection upon the issuance of quota of 
wheat to the “Petitioner Mill” if the information is provided in terms 
of the “SOP” as already provided by one M/s Al-Jehan Flour Mills, 
Multan during continuance of contract with Directorate General 
Procurement (Army) and in this regard he had submitted copy of letter 

 
Writ Petition No.3042 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
6 
dated 14.10.2022 submitted by the Officer Commanding to the 
District Food Controller, Multan mentioning the grinding schedule for 
the relevant month. It is interesting to note that the “Petitioner Mill” 
despite complying with the “SOP” for getting subsidized wheat 
quota, is reluctant to provide the grinding schedule merely stating that 
the Respondents are not issuing the wheat quota which infringed his 
fundamental rights of trade and business under Article 18 of the 
“Constitution”. No doubt, the said Article promotes the rights of 
trade/business of every citizen to carry out lawful trade but these 
rights are subject to certain qualifications as prescribed by the law and 
the law in this case is the “SOP” issued in pursuance of the 
“Notification” by the Food Department under the “Rules”.  It is a 
settled principle of law that when a law describes or requires a thing 
to be done in a particular manner, it should be done in that manner 
or not at all. Reliance in this regard may well be placed upon 
observation in “ATTAULLAH KHAN versus ALI AZAM AFRIDI 
and others” (2023 PLC (C.S) 182).  
9. 
During the pendency of this writ petition, the counsel for the 
“Petitioner Mill” has placed on record letter dated 05.01.2023 
through C.M.No.56 of 2023, issued by the Officer Commanding to 
the “Petitioner Mill” by mentioning the grinding schedule of defence 
wheat for the month of January 2023 to be completed on 31 January, 
2023 and that grinding for the month of February 2023 will start from 
1st February 2023. A letter dated 14.11.2022 has also been placed on 
record through aforesaid application which was addressed to Deputy 
Attorney General by the Lieutenant Colonel (Retire) for Directorate 
General Procurement (Army) by stating that Pak Army has no 
objection on private milling on completion of grinding requirement of 
Pak Army against each month but with respect to sharing information 
it was stated as under: 
a. 
Any 
information 
about 
the 
sale/purchase of the stores under the 
contract shall not be communicated to 
any 
person, 
other 
than 
the 
manufacturer of the stores or to any 

 
Writ Petition No.3042 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
7 
press or agency not authorized by 
Director General Procurement (Army) 
to receive it. The breach of the 
undertaking shall be punishable under 
the Official Secrets Act, 1923. 
b. 
By giving the information, “it can 
easily be identified, how many troops 
are dependent on the flour mill, hence 
is sensitive in nature, therefore, 
sharing 
of 
information 
by 
the 
contractor will lead to breach of 
Security and may threaten the life as 
well as State Security. 
c. 
However, Food Department being a 
Government Department can ask any 
clarification as and when required 
directly from Directorate General 
Procurement (Army) through official 
channel rather than asking from the 
contractor. 
 
10. 
In view of the above observations, it is quite obvious that no 
information with regard to sale/purchase of stores under the contract 
with the Army shall be communicated to any person, other than the 
manufacturer of the stores or to any press or agency not authorized by 
Director General Procurement (Army) to receive it. It is quite evident 
from the “SOP” under challenge that the “Petitioner Mill” is only 
obligated to submit monthly grinding schedule to the concerned 
District Food Controller duly approved by the concerned authority of 
Pakistan Army and not the information with regard to sale or purchase 
of stores which amounts to breach of certain terms and conditions of 
the contract executed between the “Petitioner Mill” and the Pak 
Army. Moreover, the “Petitioner Mill” has not brought on record 
specific grinding days of Pak Army in a month for the release of 
Government wheat quota. It is manifest from the letter dated 
22.09.2022 issued by the District Food Controller, Attock requiring 
the “Petitioner Mill” to submit information in terms of days specified 
for grinding of Pak Army but the “Petitioner Mill” remained fail to 
provide such information pursuant to which the “Petitioner Mill” was 
refused to get government wheat quota during the days of Pak Army 
grinding.  

 
Writ Petition No.3042 of 2022

11. 
It is settled law that writ is for enforcement of fundamental 
rights and not for the entitlement of rights and if any equitable relief is 
sought from the Court then it can only be granted subject to provision 
of relevant law. Reliance is placed on the judgment of Supreme Court 
of Pakistan in a case reported as “ASADULLAH MANGI and others 
Versus PAKISTAN INTERNATIONAL AIRLINES CORPORATION 
and others” (2005 SCMR 445). Admittedly the “Petitioner Mill” has 
approached this Court under Article 199 of the “Constitution” 
seeking directions against the Respondents and while seeking such 
directions, Article 4 and 5 of the “Constitution” have to be kept in 
mind. It is also worth mentioning that it is inalienable right of every 
citizen to be treated in accordance with law as envisaged by Article 4 
of the “Constitution” but it is subject to Article 5 of the 
“Constitution” which cast duty and inviolable obligation on every 
citizen to obey the constitution and the law, and the relevant law in 
this case is the “SOP” issued by the Respondent No.2 in the light of 
“Policy” introduced by the Food Department under the “Rules”.  
12. 
In view of above, the “Petitioner Mill” has failed to point out 
solid reasons to declare the “SOP” as an act without lawful authority 
or violative to fundamental rights, which otherwise have been issued 
by the lawful authority strictly under the “Rules”. Therefore, this 
petition holds no merit hence dismissed.
