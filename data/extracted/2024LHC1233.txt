JUDGMENT 
 
Date of decision: 
13.03.2024 
Petitioner by: 
Mr. Muhammad Yaseen Ataal, Advocate.   
Respondents by:  
Mr. Zafar Iqbal Awan, Addl. Advocate General. 
 
 
AHMAD NADEEM ARSHAD, J. Through this constitutional 
petition filed under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 petitioner Rozina Ahmed has called in 
question the vires of Orders dated 24.10.2017, 10.01.2019, 01.02.2019 
and 09.01.2023 passed by the respondent-authorities. 
2. 
Relevant facts forming background of this writ petition are that 
the petitioner in response to an Advertisement, got published by the 
Deputy Commissioner/Chairman District Recruitment Committee, 
Bahawalpur (respondent No.2) in the newspapers, applied for the post of 
ESE (Sci-Math); that on the strength of her educational certificates 
duly fulfilled the prescribed criteria for the said post, was appointed as 
such in BS-9 in Government GPS School, Chak No.114/DNB, Tehsil 
Yazman, District Bahawalpur on contract basis through ‘Letter of 
Agreement’ dated 31st July, 2017; that after fulfilling all codal 
formalities including verification of academic qualifications, she was 
allowed to join service; that in response to that letter of agreement 
petitioner submitted her joining report on 01.08.2017 and started 
teaching in the said School; that within a short span of time District 
Education Officer (M-EE), Bahawalpur (respondent No.5) withdrew her 
Letter of Agreement vide Order dated 24.10.2017 on the sole ground 

Writ Petition No.1287 of 2023/BWP 
2
that 
Result 
Card 
of 
MCS 
issued 
by 
the 
concerned 
Institution/University was incompatible with the cut-off date of 
advertisement meaning thereby the petitioner at the time of applying 
for the aforementioned post was not in possession of degree of MCS, 
hence, the same was not acceptable according to the terms and 
conditions contained in the Recruitment Policy 2016-2017; being 
offended by that order, the petitioner approached this Court through 
Writ Petition No.9488 of 2017/BWP which was disposed of vide 
order dated 24.04.2018 whereby matter was remitted to the Secretary 
Education (Schools), Government of the Punjab, Lahore (respondent 
No.1) with a direction to consider her petition as ‘Representation’ and 
decide the same in accordance with law, rules and policy on the 
subject after granting an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner and 
others; that in compliance with order of this Court, respondent No.1 
after considering the submissions of the petitioner and other stake 
holders dismissed her Representation vide order dated 10.01.2019  
with further direction to initiate departmental proceedings against the 
members of scrutiny committee under PEEDA Act, 2006 for 
extending undue benefit to the petitioner in violation of the provisions 
contained under Recruitment Policy 2016-2017; that later on in 
compliance with order passed by the Secretary Education (Schools), 
as mentioned above, respondent No.5 restored his order dated 
24.10.2017 vide fresh order dated 01.02.2019.  
3. 
It is worth mentioning that in another Writ Petition 
No.10020/2017 involving the identical proposition of law, was 
allowed by this Court vide judgment dated 29.01.2019 in which 
petitioner of the said writ petition was allowed to continue his service 
on the post. Present petitioner Rozina Ahmed by taking the support of 
that judgment previously filed W.P No.1775/2019 before this Court 
whereby vide order dated 01.06.2022 matter again referred to 
respondent No.1 to re-consider her case in the light of judgment dated 
29.01.2019 and pass fresh order after providing proper opportunity of 
hearing to all concerned without being prejudiced by his earlier order 

Writ Petition No.1287 of 2023/BWP 
3
dated 10.01.2019. In compliance with said order, respondent No.1 
without taking into consideration the law point discussed in the 
aforementioned judgment again dismissed the Representation of the 
petitioner vide order dated 09.01.2023. Feeling aggrieved petitioner 
has challenged the vires of orders dated 24.10.2017, 10.01.2019, 
01.02.2019 and 09.01.2023 passed by the respondent authorities 
through the instant writ petition. 
4. 
    Learned counsel for the petitioner in support of his 
contentions inter alia argued that the petitioner could not have been 
removed from service as she had obtained degree of MCS much prior 
to the last date for applying to the post of ESE (Sci-Math); adds that 
the petitioner was duly selected after going through recruitment 
process, therefore, could not have been terminated in view of principle 
laid down in the judgment dated 29.01.2019 with regard to rule of 
locus poenitentiae in favour of the employees as enunciated by the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in a number of judgments. He 
placed reliance on the cases titled Mst.Basharat Jehan Versus Director 
General, Federal Government Education, FGEI (C/Q) Rawalpindi and others 
(2015 SCMR 1418), Executive District Officer (Edu), Rawalpindi and others 
Versus Mst. Rizwan Kausar and 4 others (2011 SCMR 1581), Collector of 
Customs and Central Excise Peshawar and 2 others Versus Abdul Waheed and 2 
others (2004 SCMR 303) and Muhammad Shoaib and 2 others Versus 
Government of N.W.F.P. through The Collector, D.I. Khan and others (2005 
SCMR 85). 
5. 
     On the other hand, learned law officer has vehemently 
opposed the contentions. The bottom line of arguments advanced on 
behalf of the respondent authorities was that at the time of applying 
for the post of ESE (Sci-Math) petitioner had not possessed MCS 
degree. He maintains that under the Recruitment Policy 2016-2017 
she was required to file complete application in all respects; he adds 
that a candidate was required to have prescribed qualifications and or 
complete the degree before the last date of filing the application; that 
during the process of verification/scrutiny on a complaint it came to 

Writ Petition No.1287 of 2023/BWP 
4
notice 
that 
the 
petitioner 
did 
not 
have 
the 
requisite 
qualification/degree of MCS at the time of applying for the post of 
ESE (Sci-Math); that on query the petitioner produced her final Result 
Card/Final Transcript issued by her Institution/University whereby 
date of completion was mentioned as 07.04.2017 and date of issuance 
of the same was 13.04.2017 with variation of marks obtained by the 
petitioner, therefore, she was not entitled to apply for the said post at 
the time of advertisement.  
6. 
     I have heard arguments of learned counsel for the parties and 
perused the record with their able assistance. 
7. 
     It evinces from the record that after fulfilling all codal 
formalities including scrutiny process, written examination as well as 
interview, etc., the petitioner was selected against the post of ESE 
(Sci-Math) and as a consequence of which she was issued letter of 
Agreement/Appointment letter dated 31.07.2017. She submitted her 
joining report on 01.08.2017 and then started working as Teacher in 
GPS School Chak No.114/DNB, Yazman. Almost two months later, 
her appointment letter was withdrawn by respondent No.5 through 
impugned order dated 24.10.2017 on the sole ground that petitioner 
had passed the MCS Examination after cut-off date of advertisement 
i.e 07.02.2017 which was not acceptable.  
8. 
Undeniably, at the time of submission of application petitioner 
annexed Provisional Result Card issued by the Government Sadiq 
College Women University Bahawalpur on which date of issuance 
was mentioned as 27.01.2017 relating to academic Session 2014-
2016. As per record, cut-off date mentioned in the advertisement was 
07.02.2017 meaning thereby that she had passed the MCS degree 
Examination successfully much prior to the cut-off date. Record 
further reveals that after passing through the recruitment process, the 
petitioner was declared as successful candidate by the Recruitment 
Committee. She was selected/appointed as ESE (Sci-Math) in BS-9 
vide Letter of Agreement dated 31.07.2017 and asked to join the duty. 

Writ Petition No.1287 of 2023/BWP 
5
In compliance with said order she joined her duty as Teacher ESE 
(Sci-Math) in GPS Yazman. After two months of her joining the duty, 
she was asked by respondent No.5 to produce final Result Card. 
Petitioner submitted Final Transcript/Result Card. It was containing 
the date of completion as 07.04.2017 whereas date of issuance was 
13.04.2027. The respondent authorities instead of first getting 
clarification from the concerned University as to whether on 
07.02.2017 petitioner had passed the MCS Examination (Sessions 2014-
2016) straightaway withdrew her appointment letter vide impugned 
order dated 24.10.2017 maintaining that the same was issued after the 
cut-off date mentioned in the advertisement. 
9. 
     Admittedly, the Provisional Result Card and Final Transcript 
pertain to the same MCS Session 2014-2016. It is further observed 
that in both result cards marks obtained by the petitioner against each 
subject were same. Even the name of subjects were same in both the 
Result Cards. The main reason prevailed with respondent authorities 
for recalling appointment letter of the petitioner was that there was a 
difference with regard to total marks secured by her in the Provisional 
Result Card and Final Transcript. 
10. 
       In order to proceed further, firstly it is better to understand 
the meaning of ‘Provisional’. In this respect, guidance has been 
sought from the renowned dictionaries. The gist of which is 
reproduced below:- 
The Black’s Law Dictionary defines the word ‘Provisional’ as 
under: 
‘Provisional’: Temporary <a provisional injunction>. 2. 
Conditional.  
The Cambridge Advanced Learner’s Dictionary defines the 
word ‘Provisional’ as under: 
‘Provisional’: For the present time but likely to change, 
temporary.   
The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English defines 
the word ‘Provisional’ as under: 

Writ Petition No.1287 of 2023/BWP 
6
‘Provisional’: 1. Intended to exist for only a short time and 
likely to be changed in the future.  
The Concise Orford Thesaurus defines the word ‘Provisional’ 
as under: 
‘Provisional’: Interim, temporary, pro tem; transitional, 
changeover, stopgap, short-term, fill-in, acting, caretaker, 
subject to confirmation, penciled in, working, tentative, 
contingent.  
The Oxford English Urdu Dictionary defines the word 
‘Provisional’ as under: 
‘Provisional’: صرف فوری۔ ضرورت کے لیے؛ عارضی 
 
11. 
   From the above connotation, it has been gathered that 
provisional document is issued only for the time being which is 
always temporary in nature and likely to vary in future. In the case in 
hand one thing is clear that academic session of both result cards 
reflecting the year 2014-2016, marks secured by the petitioner against 
each subject in the four semesters are same even name of subjects 
were also same in both result cards. So, variation in both result cards 
with regard to CGPA, Percentage, Credit Hours and marks of the 
petitioner by the concerned Institution/University was a natural 
phenomenon. No doubt in the Provisional Result Card the total marks 
obtained by the petitioner in the examination was shown as 1714 
against total marks 2200 with 77.91 percentage. Likewise, marks 
reflected in the Final Transcript were shown as 1784 against total 
marks 2300 with 77.57 percentage. From the above, it was clear that 
result of one of the subjects was kept in waiting and the same was yet 
to be declared. However, Institution/University in routine or on the 
request of petitioner as she had to apply for the post under reference 
issued Provisional Result Card which clearly mentioned that number 
of one of the subjects was yet to be prepared/calculated by the 
Controller of Examination’s Department of the Institution/University. 
However, almost two months later when the petitioner was issued 
Final Transcript against total subject, her total marks were shown as 
1784 out of 2300. It does not mean that when Provisional Result Card 

Writ Petition No.1287 of 2023/BWP 
7
issued by the University/Institution on 27.01.2017 petitioner was 
failed in one subject or she had not appeared in one of the subjects 
rather it was the University which withheld the result of one of the 
subjects due to its non-availability at the relevant time. It is also not 
the case of respondent authorities that petitioner had committed fraud, 
cheating or she obtained the post in question on the basis of fake MCS 
degree at the time of Test/Interview. In the comments, the only 
allegation against the petitioner was that she submitted incomplete 
result card of MCS. In fact, examination result of one subject which 
was reflected in the Final Transcript was yet to be awaited by the 
University/Institution at the time of issuing Provisional Result Card. 
This observation gets further support from the fact that if petitioner 
was failed in one of the subjects the Institution/University would 
definitely mention this fact in the Final Transcript that candidate 
(petitioner) had qualified the MCS degree examination in ‘Parts’ 
whereas no such thing was noted in the Final Transcript. With sorry to 
say that none of the side could assist the Court on this very important 
fact.  
12. 
     So far as disparity in dates on both Result Cards is 
concerned, suffice it to say, that when material facts as discussed 
above fully proved that petitioner had passed the MCS Examination 
much before the cut-off date, it does not have any significance. She at 
the time of applying for the post in question was a qualified female 
candidate duly fulfilled the criteria set out in the advertisement, got 
published by the respondents in the newspapers. Of course, whenever 
a job application is given by a candidate, the same goes through the 
scrutiny process by the Department and after short listing only eligible 
candidates are allowed to appear in the Test/Interview. There is 
nothing on the record that prior to the issuance of Agreement Letter, 
any objection qua qualification of the petitioner was ever raised by the 
Recruitment Committee. Even at the time of interview, she presented 
the Provisional Result Card but no objection was raised. Record 
shows that she passed the written test/interview and successfully 

Writ Petition No.1287 of 2023/BWP 
8
qualified for the post of ESE(Sci-Math) purely on merit. It is worth 
mentioning that in pursuance of the Agreement Letter dated 
31.07.2017 petitioner submitted the joining report on 01.08.2017. She 
was allowed to work on the said post and then all of a sudden in 
absence of any complaint qua her work and conduct the petitioner was 
stopped to perform duty and then removed her from service through 
impugned order/letter dated 24.10.2017. 
13. 
        Record further reveals that in an identical situation this 
Court in another case (i.e W.P No.10020 of 2017/BWP) recalled order dated 
20.11.2017 passed by respondent No.5 and allowed the petitioner 
(Muhammad Saqib) to continue his service. It was held in the said order 
that “if any right is created by the act of the Appointing Authority and rule of 
locus poenitentiae in favour of the employees of either side, they be treated in the 
light of judgments of august Supreme Court of Pakistan reported as Executive 
District Officer (Edu), Rawalpindi and others Versus Mst. Rizwan Kausar and 4 others (2011 
SCMR 1581), Collector of Customs and Central Excise Peshawar and 2 others Versus Abdul 
Waheed and 2 others (2004 SCMR 303) and Muhammad Shoaib and 2 others Versus 
Government of N.W.F.P. through The Collector, D.I. Khan and others (2005 SCMR 85).’       
             The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in its judgment 
reported as Mst. Basharat Jehan v. Director General, Federal Government 
Education, FGEI (C/Q) Rawilpindi and others (2015 SCMR 1418) observed 
as under:- 
“Once a right is accrued to the appellant by appointment 
letters issued after complying with all the codal formalities 
could not be taken away on mere assumption and or 
supposition and or whims and fancy of any executive 
functionary. Such right once vests, cannot be destroyed or 
withdrawn as legal bar would come into play under the well 
doctrine of locus poenitentiae, well recognized and 
entrenched in our jurisprudence (One may refer to 
Director, Social Welfare, N.W.F.P., Peshawar v. Sadullah 
Khan (1996 SCMR 1350).” 
          Keeping in view the identical situation of the case in hand, it 
appears that respondent No.1 did not keep in mind the principle 
enunciated in the said illuminated judgments of the Superior Courts 
before passing the impugned orders rather haphazardly dismissed the 

Writ Petition No.1287 of 2023/BWP 
9
Representations of the petitioner twice on the reasons alien to the facts 
and circumstances of the case in hand.   
14. 
  From the overall analysis of the case, it is clear that the 
petitioner had qualified her MCS degree on 27.01.2017 before the cut-
off date of advertisement. She was simply awaiting her Final Result 
Card/Final Transcript and in the meanwhile posts of ESE (Sci-Math) 
were invited by the respondent authorities. Since at the relevant time 
she had not in possession of Final Transcript and the cut-off date was 
going to expire she relied on her Provisional Card already issued by 
her Institution/University and applied for the post of ESE (Sci-Math) 
and then successfully compete the same among so many other 
candidates. 
15. 
      The sum up of above discussion is that this writ petition is 
allowed. The impugned orders passed by the respondent authorities 
are set aside being illegal and unlawful. They are directed to allow the 
petitioner to resume her duty as ESE (Sci-Math) forthwith on receipt 
of certified copy of this order.
