Addl. District Judge, etc.  
 
J U D G M E N T 
 
Date of hearing:      
11.05.2023. 
Petitioner by: 
 
Mr. Zafar Abbas Khan, Advocate.  
Respondent No.7 by: 
Mr. Asif Ali Kahloon, Advocate.  
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.- Through instant 
petition, petitioner has assailed the vires of order dated 18.2.2021 and 
judgment dated 17.12.2021, passed by learned Civil Judge and Addl. 
District Judge, Mianwali, respectively, whereby petitioner’s request to 
cross-examine DW-4 was turned down by the Courts below. 
2. 
Facts in brief are that respondent No.7, Mushtaq Ahmed 
instituted a suit for declaration to the effect that he alongwith petitioner 
and respondents No.8 to 11 are legal heirs of deceased Muhammad 
Abdullah, thus, are owners in possession of the suit house left by the 
deceased. Petitioner and respondent No.11 in their written statements 
contended that deceased Muhammad Abdaullah gifted the suit house to 
Atta Muhammad/petitioner during his lifetime whereas respondent 
No.8/Mst. Sughran Bibi in her written statement alleged that no such 
gift was made and all legal heirs are entitled to get their shares from 
the suit house. In evidence, said respondent while appearing as DW-4 
in her examination-in-chief and cross-examination conducted by 
learned counsel for plaintiff repeated her stance taken in written 

2 
W.P. No.25275 of 2022 
statement. Later on, learned counsel for petitioner requested the Court 
that said witness be declared hostile and also sought permission to 
cross-examine the said witness. Learned Trial Court vide impugned 
order dated 18.2.2021 declined the request of the petitioner. Feeling 
aggrieved, the petitioner filed a revision petition before the learned 
Addl. District Judge, Mianwali, who vide judgment dated 17.12.2021 
dismissed the same. Hence, this petition. 
3. 
Learned counsel for petitioner submits that since the witness got 
recorded her statement adversely against the interest of the petitioner, 
therefore, petitioner is entitled to cross-examine her. Further submits 
that both the Courts below without observing the real facts of the case 
declined the request of the petitioner, hence impugned decisions are 
liable to be set aside. 
4. 
On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent No.7 submits 
that Mst. Sughran Bibi herself appeared before the Court as 
independent witness in support of her own version and petitioner did 
not call or produce the said lady as witness in support of his version, 
therefore, the contention of petitioner to declare the said witness as 
hostile with permission to cross examine carries no weight. 
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused. 
6. 
Admittedly, petitioner and Mst. Sughran Bibi/respodnent No.8 
are co-defendants in the suit filed by respondent No.7. Respondent 
No.8 has endorsed the claim of plaintiff/respodnent No.7 and in 
evidence as DW-4 supported his version unlike other defendants, 
who supported the stance of petitioner. The sole point for 
determination by this Court is "Whether a defendant has right to 
cross-examine the co-defendant? If so, in what circumstances? 
7. 
The procedure of examination of witnesses is synchronized by 
Articles 130 to 161 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. Article 
130 aims to regulate procedure as to production and examination of 

3 
W.P. No.25275 of 2022 
witnesses in the Court, while Article 132 elaborates  three stages 
that might come while recording statement of a witness. First stage 
is examination-in-chief by the party who has produced a witness, 
second stage is cross-examination by the opposite party and third 
stage is re-examination, optional with the party calling the witness. 
For the sake of convenience, Article 132 (ibid) is reproduced 
hereunder: 
 
 
132. 
Examination-in-chief, 
etc. 
(1) 
The 
examination of a witness by the party who calls him 
shall be called his examination-in-chief. 
 
 
(2) 
The examination of a witness by the adverse 
party shall be called his cross-examination. 
 
 
(3) 
The examination of a witness, subsequent to 
the cross-examination by the party who called him, 
shall be called his re-examination. 
 
8. 
The expression "adverse party" is defined in the Black's Law 
Dictionary, Sixth Edition at page 53, as "a party to an action whose 
interests are opposed to or opposite the interest of another party to 
the action". In general, an adverse party is an opposing party in a 
lawsuit. 
9. 
It may be observed that there is no specific provision in the 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984,  providing opportunity to a 
defendant to cross-examine a co-defendant; however having regard 
to the object and scope of cross-examination, it is settled principle of 
law that when a statement is made against the interest of a party to 
the proceedings, before that evidence could be acted upon, the party 
should have an ample opportunity to cross-examine the witness, who 
had given the evidence against him. It is only after such an 
opportunity is given and the witness is cross-examined then 
evidence becomes admissible. In Sarkar on Evidence, Fifteenth 
Edition at pages 2182 and 2183, the following discussion is 
available:- 
 
Right to cross-examine Co-Accused's and Co-
Defendant's Witnesses. Sections 137 and 138 of the 

4 
W.P. No.25275 of 2022 
Evidence Act do not specifically refer to cross-
examination of co-defendant's witnesses. But the Court 
have to adopt a golden rule that no evidence shall be 
received against a co-defendant or co-accused who had 
no opportunity of testing it by cross-examination; as it 
would be unjust and unsafe not to allow a co-accused 
or co-defendant to cross-examine witness called by one 
whose case was adverse to his, or who has given 
evidence against him. Where it is shown that the 
interest between the defendants inter se conflict each 
other, the other defendant has necessarily to be treated 
as an adversary and he is certainly entitled to cross-
examine the other or his witnesses. [Mohd. Ziaulla v. 
Sorgra Begum, 1997 AIHC 2628 (2629-2630) (Kant)] 
 
No special provision is made in the Evidence Act for the 
cross-examination 
of 
the 
co-accused's 
or 
co-
defendant's witnesses. But the procedure to be adopted 
may be regulated by the well-known rule that no 
evidence should be received against one who had no 
opportunity of testing it by cross-examination; as it 
would be unjust and unsafe not to allow a co-accused 
or co-defendant to cross-examine witness called by one 
whose case was adverse to his, or who has given 
evidence against. If there is no clash of interest or if 
nothing has been said against the other party, there 
cannot be any right of cross-examination. 
 
In "Phipson on Evidence", Tenth Edition, para. 
1538., it is provided that: 
 
A defendant may cross-examine a co-defendant or any 
other witness who has given evidence against him, and 
reply on such evidence though there is no issue joined 
between them. (Lord v. Colvin, 3 drew 222; Allen v. 
Allen {1894} P. 248 (C.A.); RE Wagstaff, 96 L.T. 605; 
Dryden v. Surrey C.C. {1936} 2 All E.R. 535). 
 
 
It is clear from the above that evidence becomes admissible 
after only it passes through the process of cross-examination by the 
adverse party regardless of the fact that the adverse party is a 
plaintiff or co-defendant. However, the condition precedent is the 
conflict of interest. Reference can be made to “Muhammad Imran 
Khan and 4 others v. Haji Muhammad Akhtar and others” (PLD 
2021 Sindh 510). 
10.  
There is another eventuality where a witness can be declared 
hostile when he resiles from earlier statement or material part thereof 
which may also be in the form of joint pleadings or examination-in-

5 
W.P. No.25275 of 2022 
chief. Permission to cross-examine the witness would also be granted 
where the statement is contrary to the evidence which the witness was 
expected to give. Reference is made to “Gulzar Mehmood Khan v. 
Abdul Waheed” (2016 CLC 848) and “Inayat Ullah v. Riaz Ahmad” 
(1998 CLC 1148).  
11. 
Needless to say that the right to allow a party to cross-examine 
a witness of his own is discretionary with the Court and this discretion 
is to be exercised judiciously. Article 150 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 
Order, 1984, confers on the Court a wide discretion in allowing a 
party calling a witness to put such questions to him as might be put in 
cross-examination by the adverse party, where the evidence given by 
the witness is unfavourable to the party calling him, or is contrary to 
the evidence which the witness was expected to give. In such a case, 
the Judge should permit such statements to be tested by 
cross-examination if the evidence is to be relied upon. Undeniably, a 
party is bound by the evidence it produces i.e. party producing a 
witness is bound by whatever statement the witness makes however 
when an adverse statement is made by a witness the party producing 
the witness may get the witness declared hostile and seek permission 
from the Court to cross-examine her for getting rid of her adverse 
testimony. However, there is one exception that such permission 
should not be allowed by the Court if it reaches to the conclusion that 
the object of such cross-examination is to cover up the lacuna in the 
evidence. 
12. 
In the case in hand, while submitting written statement, 
recording examination-in-chief as DW-4 and even during cross-
examination conducted by plaintiff, the stance of respondent 
No.8/defendant No.3 remained adverse to the interest of other 
defendants and DWs. From the facts of the case, it cannot be 
inferred that the said witness came from petitioner’s side because as 
per record, learned counsel concluded petitioner’s oral and 
documentary evidence on 14.1.2021. However, statement of 

6 
W.P. No.25275 of 2022 
respodnent No.8 as DW-4 was recorded on 18.2.2021 and even in 
presence of written statement of respondent No.8, there was no 
hope that said witness would depose in favour of petitioner. In these 
circumstances, it cannot be presumed that declaring said witness 
hostile and allowing to be cross-examined by a co-defendant would 
be an attempt to fill the lacuna. 
13. 
For the foregoing facts and reasons, instant petition is 
allowed and the impugned decisions passed by the Courts below are 
hereby set aside being illegal and without lawful authority. Learned 
Trial Court is directed to allow the petitioner to cross-examine 
defendant No.3/DW-4.
