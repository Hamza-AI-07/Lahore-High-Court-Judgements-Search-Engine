Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – Respondent No.3, a Pakistani-born 
U.S. citizen and retired U.S. Army serviceman, returned to Pakistan and 
established a pharmaceutical marketing business under the name T.G. 
Pharma (“TGP”). According to him, on 01.07.2017, he employed the 
Petitioner, Mir Mobeen Ahmad, as Sales Manager, who brought in his own 
team. After some time, Respondent No.3 noticed a significant drop in sales. 
He drew the Petitioner’s attention to it, but he was evasive. Subsequently, 
Respondent No.3 had the business accounts audited, which allegedly 
revealed that the Petitioner had supplied medicines worth Rs. 5,513,180.85 
to various pharmacies. He issued notices to them to recover the money. 
Many claimed to have already paid the Petitioner, while others denied 
purchasing any medicines. Respondent No.3 accused the Petitioner of 
misappropriating the funds and falsifying records to conceal the fraud. On 
23.03.2021, he submitted a written application to the SHO, Police Station 
Mustafa Town, Lahore, requesting registration of an FIR against the 
Petitioner.

The SHO did not take any action on Respondent No.3’s 
aforementioned complaint. Therefore, he approached the Ex officio Justice 
of Peace, Lahore (“JOP”), under section 22-A Cr.P.C. for intervention. 
However, on 31.05.2021, he withdrew his application to avail a remedy 
before the Punjab Overseas Pakistanis Commission (the “Commission”), 
reserving his right to make a fresh application under section 22-A Cr.P.C. 
on the subject, if required.  
3. 
 
The Commission registered Respondent No.3’s complaint  
(ID No.28249) and, vide Letter No.612 dated 11.06.2021, the Director 
(Police Matters) referred the matter to the DIG Operations, asking him to 
“redress the grievance of the complainant on priority in accordance with 
law and share progress within 07 days.” This exercise was without fruition. 
Therefore, on 14.07.2021, Respondent No.3 approached the JOP under 
section 22-A Cr.P.C. seeking a direction to the SHO, Police Station 
Mustafa Town, for registration of FIR against the Petitioner. The JOP 
issued notice to the Petitioner but he did not appear.1 The JOP accepted 
Respondent No.3’s application by order dated 02.09.2021 (the “Impugned 
Order”) and issued the requisite directive, observing that it disclosed 
commission of a cognizable offence. 
4. 
 
The Petitioner has challenged the Impugned Order before this 
Court through this petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”). He contends that 
Respondent No.3 has obtained it through fraud, misrepresentation and 
concealment of facts. He denies having joined TGP as a Sales Manager and 
also the existence of a master-and-servant relationship between them. He 
asserts that he invested in TGP under an agreement dated 01.07.2017 (the 
“Agreement”), purchased 15% share and became a partner in the business 
which was previously owned and run by Respondent No.3 as a sole 
proprietor. He gave four cheques of different dates for an aggregate amount 
of Rs.1,950,000/- to Respondent No.3 in pursuance of the Agreement for 
the purchase of the aforementioned share in the business. The first cheque 
(No.2400104340 dated 03.10.2017) for Rs. 500,000/- was encashed upon 
which Respondent No.3 inducted the Petitioner into the business, and he 
                                          
1 See Paragraph 8 of the Impugned Order dated 02.09.2021.

started working. The Petitioner alleges that in July 2019, Respondent No.3 
shifted TGP’s office to his residence without the Petitioner’s consent or 
notifying him, and verbally informed him that he had expelled him from 
the business. The Petitioner states that he asked Respondent No. 3 to settle 
the accounts so that the firm’s profit and losses could be determined and he 
could recover his investment, along with the profit from the previous two 
years, but he refused. Instead, Respondent No.3 published a notice in the 
daily Khabrain dated 19.10.2019 stating that the Petitioner was his 
employee and had been dismissed from service due to misconduct. The 
Petitioner immediately responded and published a rebuttal in the daily 
Jehan Pakistan dated 23.11.2019, contradicting Respondent No.3’s claim 
and to clarify his own position.  
5. 
 
The Petitioner contends that Respondent No.3’s claim is 
falsified by the Agreement (a copy whereof has been appended with the 
present petition). He submits that Respondent No.3 was obligated to file his 
appointment letter along with his application under section 22-A Cr.P.C. 
because he claimed that the Petitioner was his employee (Sales Manager). 
However, no such letter was produced. According to the Petitioner, the 
very foundation on which Respondent No.3 built his case is missing, so the 
Impugned Order is unsustainable.  
6. 
 
The Petitioner further contends that one partner cannot invoke 
section 406 PPC against another partner. Since the Agreement establishes 
that the Petitioner and Respondent No.3 were partners in TGP, Respondent 
No.3 should seek remedy before the civil court. He cannot prosecute the 
Petitioner under section 406 PPC for breach of trust, if any.  
7. 
 
It is important to highlight that this Court suspended the 
operation of the Impugned Order on 10.09.2021. Respondent No.3 filed 
C.M. No.4/2021 for vacation of the injunction, narrating facts substantially 
different from those stated in his application dated 23.03.2021 to the SHO, 
Police Station Mustafa Town, Lahore. His version in that application was 
that the Petitioner had lured him into signing the Agreement through false 
pretences. Shortly thereafter, he (Respondent No.3) went abroad for 
medical treatment, and during his absence, the Petitioner allegedly started 
selling “precious items” belonging to TGP, which his staff reported to him.

Thereupon, Respondent No.3 rushed back to Pakistan and confronted the 
Petitioner, but received no proper explanation. He issued notices to the 
vendees, who replied that they had paid the full amount to the Petitioner 
and owed nothing further. Respondent No.3 alleged that the Petitioner 
misappropriated the sale proceeds of TGP’s assets. He admitted that he had 
received Rs. 500,000/- from the Petitioner through Cheque No.2400104340 
dated 03.10.2017, but claimed that the remaining three cheques were not 
encashed for reasons attributable to the Petitioner. Hence, he asserted, no 
valid partnership was constituted. 
8. 
 
Respondent No.3 has vehemently opposed this petition. He 
contends that his application to the Respondent SHO disclosed commission 
of a cognizable offence. As such, the JOP was justified in passing the 
Impugned Order. Respondent No.3 argues that “criminal breach of trust” as 
defined in section 405 PPC has a wide scope and sections 406 to 409 PPC 
prescribe the punishment for that offence committed by various 
individuals. None of these provisions prohibits the prosecution of one 
partner by another. The Petitioner’s argument to the contrary is 
misconceived.  
9. 
 
The Assistant Advocate General has argued only on the 
interpretation of sections 405 to 409 PPC and has supported Respondent 
No.3 on this score.    
Opinion 
10. 
 
I must begin with section 405 PPC which defines the offence 
of “criminal breach of trust”. It reads: 
405. Criminal breach of trust. – Whoever, being in any manner 
entrusted with property, or with any dominion over property, dishonestly 
misappropriates or converts to his own use that property, or dishonestly 
uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law 
prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged, or of any 
legal contract, express or implied, which he has made touching the 
discharge of such trust, or willfully suffers any other person so to do, 
commits “criminal breach of trust”.2 
} 
                                          
2 Clarificatory Note: 
The provisions of section 405 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 (“PPC”) are identical to section 405 of 
the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (“IPC”). The pre-partition and post-partition Indian authorities cited in this 
judgment therefore remain relevant for interpretative guidance. For ease of reference, this judgment refers 
to section 405 PPC (or simply section 405 of the Penal Code), although the cited Indian cases use the IPC 
nomenclature.

11. 
 
The essential ingredients of criminal breach of trust under 
section 405 PPC are: (i) the accused must be entrusted with property or 
dominion over it; and (ii) he must have dishonestly misappropriated the 
property or converted it to his own use or disposed of it in violation of any 
trust or willfully suffered any other person to do so. The offence of 
criminal breach of trust resembles the offence of embezzlement under 
English law.3 The punishment for ordinary cases is provided in section 406 
PPC but there are also aggravated forms of the offence which are dealt with 
under sections 407 to 409 PPC. Both the aforementioned elements must be 
present simultaneously to constitute criminal breach of trust.4   
12. 
 
The first condition mentions three important terms: 
entrustment, dominion, and property. “Entrustment” means handing over 
possession of something for some purpose without conferring the right of 
ownership5 while “dominion” refers to “the right of control or possession 
over something, such as, dominion over the truck”.6 The term “property” 
has been used without any qualification, so it must be understood in the 
wider sense. There is no reason to restrict its meaning to movable 
property.7 A trust contemplated by section 405 PPC would arise only when 
the property belongs to someone other than the accused. 
13. 
 
In Jaswantrai Manilal Akhaney v. State of Bombay  
[1956] SCR 483, 498-500 : AIR 1956 SC 575, the Supreme Court of India 
(SCI) held that “entrustment” under section 405 of the Penal Code does not 
require the creation of a trust with all the technicalities of trust law. Rather, 
it envisages a relationship in which the owner of property delivers it to 
another to be retained by him until a specified contingency arises or to be 
disposed of upon the happening of a defined event. The transferor 
continues as the legal owner of the property, while the person in whose 
favour possession is transferred acquires only custody for the benefit of the 
transferor. At the most, he obtains a special interest, such as a claim for

money advanced, expenses incurred for safekeeping, or other incidental 
charges. Similarly, in The State of Gujarat v. Jaswantlal Nathalal  
(AIR 1968 SC 700), the SCI held that before there can be entrustment, 
there must be a trust, that is, an obligation attached to ownership of 
property coupled with confidence reposed in and accepted by the recipient, 
either for the benefit of another alone or for both the owner and the 
recipient. However, such entrustment need not conform to the technicalities 
of trust law. The term “entrustment” implies that the person handing over 
property, or on whose behalf it is handed over, continues to be its legal 
owner. Furthermore, the delivery must be accompanied by confidence in 
the recipient sufficient to create a fiduciary relationship.  
14. 
 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan has adopted the same 
approach. In Muhammad Amjad Naeem v. The State and another  
(2025 SCMR 1130), it held that the term “entrustment” in section 405 PPC 
refers to a transaction in which a person gives property to another as a trust 
(Amanat), reposing confidence in the recipient. The latter is under a legal 
obligation to return the property to the entrustor. This obligation implies 
that ownership of the property remains with the entrustor and is not 
transferred to the recipient, who merely holds temporary possession or 
custody for a specific purpose. The recipient must return the same property 
and may not use or dispose of it in any other manner or for any purpose 
other than that specified by the entrustor. In this way, entrustment creates a 
fiduciary relationship between the entrustor and the recipient. However, the 
judgment clarifies that this does not mean that such entrustment must 
conform to the technical requirements of trust law. 
15. 
 
Given the above, the concept of entrustment under section 405 
PPC does not ordinarily extend to transactions such as investments, loans, 
sales, promises of profit, or breaches of mere contractual promises.8 
16. 
 
The second condition to constitute criminal breach of trust 
under section 405 PPC is dishonesty. Section 24 PPC defines “dishonestly” 
as “Whoever does anything with the intention of causing wrongful gain to

v. Samina Qasim Tarar and others (2022 SCMR 2001), and Muhammad Amjad Naeem v. The State

one person or wrongful loss to another person is said to do that thing 
“dishonestly”. In Ivey v. Genting Casinos (UK) Ltd t/a Crockfords  
[2017] UKSC 67, the Supreme Court observed that dishonesty is distinct 
from negligence and approved the following test set out by Lord Nicholls 
in Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v. Tan9 and by Lord Hoffmann in  
Barlow Clowes International Ltd v. Eurotrust International Ltd.10  
Lord Hoffmann, at pp 1479-1480, stated: 
“Although a dishonest state of mind is a subjective mental state, the 
standard by which the law determines whether it is dishonest is 
objective. If by ordinary standards a defendant’s mental state would be 
characterised as dishonest, it is irrelevant that the defendant judges by 
different standards. The Court of Appeal held this to be a correct state of 
the law, and their Lordships agree.” 
The Supreme Court further stated: 
“When dishonesty is in question, the fact-finding tribunal must first 
ascertain (subjectively) the actual state of the individual’s knowledge or 
belief as to the facts. The reasonableness or otherwise of his belief is a 
matter of evidence (often in practice determinative) going to whether he 
held the belief, but it is not an additional requirement that his belief must 
be reasonable; the question is whether it is genuinely held. When once 
his actual state of mind as to knowledge or belief as to facts is 
established, the question whether his conduct was honest or dishonest is 
to be determined by the fact-finder by applying the (objective) standards 
of ordinary decent people. There is no requirement that the defendant 
must appreciate that what he has done is, by those standards, dishonest.” 
17. 
 
Dishonest misappropriation may sometimes be inferred from 
the circumstances if there is no direct evidence.11 This second condition is 
satisfied by any one of four positive acts, namely, misappropriation, 
conversion, use, or disposal of property.12 
18. 
 
Partnership arrangements create a distinct challenge because 
partners are treated in law as joint owners of the firm’s assets until 
dissolution and settlement of accounts. This raises the question as to 
whether one partner can ever be said to be “entrusted” with partnership 
property for the purposes of section 405 PPC, or whether misappropriation 
of such property merely gives rise to civil liability. This issue has sparked 
considerable debate across jurisdictions, resulting in conflicting judicial 
opinions.

Under English common law, a partner could not be charged 
with larceny or embezzlement of partnership property because, as a joint 
owner, he was regarded as having an equal proprietary interest in the firm’s 
assets. Even if he received money on behalf of the firm and failed to 
account for it, he could not be prosecuted because the property was deemed 
as much his own as that of his co-partners. This was notwithstanding that, 
as an agent of the firm, a partner could be said to have received property in 
a fiduciary capacity (as an agent or servant of the firm), and his failure to 
account for it could resemble embezzlement. To address this difficulty, a 
specific provision was introduced in the Larceny Act 1901 to enable the 
prosecution of a partner for larceny or embezzlement of partnership 
property.13 However, no corresponding provision exists in the Pakistan 
Penal Code. 
20. 
 
In British India, earlier authorities generally held that if there 
is a partnership, there could not be a conviction for criminal breach of trust. 
However, in The Queen v. Okhoy Coomar Shaw, (1874) 13 Beng. L.R. 
307, a Full Bench of the Bengal High Court (comprising five judges) held 
that the language of section 405 of the Penal Code was broad enough to 
include a partner, provided that both entrustment and dishonest 
misappropriation were proved. Whether the element of entrustment exists 
in a given case is a question of fact. The Court rejected the proposition that 
partners should be exempt from the operation of this provision solely 
because of their joint ownership of partnership property.14  
21. 
 
The ruling in Okhoy Coomar Shaw has been criticized on two 
main grounds. First, it has been described as largely theoretical. It offers 
little practical guidance on how or in what circumstances a partner can be 
said to be “entrusted” with partnership property or to have misappropriated 
it, given the joint ownership of firm assets. Secondly, sections 403 to 409 
of the Penal Code fall under Chapter XVII, titled “Offences Against 
                                          
13 Under English law, the Larceny Act 1861 consolidated and codified various theft‑related offences, 
including embezzlement by clerks, servants and agents. However, it did not clearly extend to all forms of 
misappropriation by co‑partners. The Larceny Act 1901 amended sections 75 and 76 of the 1861 
legislation to impose liability for fraudulent conversion (i.e. misappropriation of entrusted property) in 
cases where a person had been entrusted with property. Under the 1916 consolidation, many of these 
provisions were reformed and absorbed in a revised statutory scheme.  
14 Okhoy Coomar Shaw was followed in Jagannath Baghunathdas v. Emperor (AIR 1932 Bombay 57), 
Bhikchand Gangaram v. Emperor (AIR 1934 Sind 22), Sham Lal v. Chaman Lal and another  
(AIR 1939 Lahore 406).

Property,” and more specifically under the sub-heading “Criminal 
Misappropriation of Property.” These provisions enumerate various 
categories of persons (such as clerks, servants, carriers, public servants, and 
agents) but make no reference to partners, not even in the statutory 
illustrations appended thereto. The illustrations envision cases in which 
property is wholly owned by another person and entrusted to the accused, 
rather than property jointly owned with them. If these illustrations are 
treated as indicative of legislative intent, they suggest that the provisions 
were not meant to apply to partners. Further, section 424 of the Penal Code 
demonstrates that dishonest or fraudulent concealment of one’s own 
property is punishable only because it expressly includes the phrase 
“property of himself or any other person.”15 
22. 
 
In Bhuban Mohan Das v. Surendra Mohan Das  
(AIR 1951 Cal. 69), a Full Bench of the Calcutta High Court  
(comprising five judges) considered, on reference, the correctness of the 
decision in Okhoy Coomar Shaw. Harries C.J. observed that for a charge 
under section 406 of the Penal Code to succeed against a partner, it must be 
shown that property belonging to someone else was entrusted to him.  
A partnership firm, unlike a limited company, has no legal existence 
separate from its partners and cannot own property independently. If a 
partner holds partnership property, it cannot be said that he has been 
entrusted with his own share in it. Nor can it be easily asserted that he 
holds his co-partner’s share in trust, since the extent of each partner’s 
interest is indeterminate until the accounts are taken, liabilities are settled, 
and the remaining assets are distributed in accordance with the partnership 
agreement. In view of this, a partner who receives partnership property in 
the ordinary course cannot be regarded as entrusted with the specific share 
of another partner so as to attract section 406. The learned Chief Justice 
further clarified that whether a partner may be said to have been entrusted 
with property depends on the existence of a special agreement between the 
parties. In the absence of such an agreement, the partner does not receive 
property in a fiduciary capacity. However, if a partnership agreement 
expressly authorizes one partner to have exclusive possession of the firm’s

assets or to receive funds on its behalf, then it may be arguable  
(though not conclusively so) that such a partner entrusts money to another 
when giving it to him for a defined purpose. 
23. 
 
Answering the reference, the Court held that Okhoy Coomar 
Shaw (ibid.) and Alla Rakha v. Liakat Hossein (44 C.W.N. 650) could not 
be regarded as correctly decided if they were read to lay down a general 
rule that partners may be prosecuted under section 406 of the Penal Code 
for handling partnership property in the ordinary course of business. 
Nevertheless, those decisions might be treated as sound precedents if 
confined to cases involving a special agreement that vests one partner with 
dominion or entrustment over the property. 
24. 
 
The SCI reaffirmed the above view in Velji Raghavji Patel v. 
State of Maharashtra (AIR 1965 SC 1433). It clarified that every partner 
has dominion over partnership property by virtue of his status as a partner. 
This dominion is inherent in ownership and is of the kind possessed by any 
co-owner over jointly held property. However, such dominion, by itself, 
does not satisfy the requirement of “entrustment” under section 405 of the 
Penal Code. To establish criminal breach of trust, it must be shown that the 
accused’s dominion over the property arose specifically from an act of 
entrustment. The Court further held that an owner of property, even if not 
its exclusive owner, cannot be held guilty of misappropriation merely for 
using that property, regardless of intent. Since a partner has a joint and 
undefined interest in the entire partnership estate, his use of partnership 
assets for personal purposes may give rise to civil liability, but it does not 
amount to criminal misappropriation within the meaning of the Penal Code. 
25. 
 
In Debabrata Gupta v. S. K. Ghosh [(1970) 1 SCC 521], the 
SCI held that an FIR under sections 406 and 424/34 of the Indian Penal 
Code (which are pari materia with sections 406 and 424/34 of the Pakistan 
Penal Code) could not be quashed merely on the ground that the dispute 
arose out of partnership dealings. The Court emphasized that criminal 
liability may still occur if the allegations disclose that the accused partner 
was 
entrusted 
with 
property 
under 
a 
specific 
agreement 
and 
misappropriated it in breach of that trust. A similar approach was adopted 
in Anil Saran v. State of Bihar [(1995) 6 SCC 142], where it was 

Writ Petition No.54567/2021 
 
 
 
- 11 -
contended that a partner could not be said to have committed a criminal 
breach of trust in respect of their own funds, and that the matter was purely 
one of civil liability. The Supreme Court ruled that a partnership firm is not 
a legal entity but a legal mode of carrying on business by all the partners. 
Until the firm is dissolved in accordance with the law and the accounts are 
settled, all partners have joint dominion over the property and funds of the 
firm. Criminal breach of trust under section 406 is not constituted with 
respect to property belonging to the partnership firm; it arises only where 
property is specially entrusted to a partner under a particular contract and 
he holds it in a fiduciary capacity under that contract. If such property is 
misappropriated, the offence is made out. 
26. 
 
Jurisprudence in Pakistan has developed along the same lines. 
In Abdul Hakim v. The State and another (PLD 1978 Karachi 359), the 
Sindh High Court quashed an FIR lodged by one partner against another on 
the ground that the accused had received money on behalf of the 
partnership, not in a fiduciary capacity, and that the proper remedy was a 
civil suit for rendition of accounts. Similarly, in Kazim Ali Dossa v. Faisal 
Malik and others (1980 PCr.LJ 818), the Court set aside a conviction 
under section 406 PPC because no special entrustment of the firm’s assets 
to the accused partner was established. 
27. 
 
In sum, the prevailing view is that a partner may be prosecuted 
under section 406 PPC only if there is proof of special entrustment or 
dominion over a particular asset arising from a distinct agreement, and the 
alleged misappropriation is established. In the absence of such entrustment, 
misappropriation of partnership property constitutes a civil wrong rather 
than a criminal offence. 
28. 
 
Having examined the governing principles, it is now necessary 
to consider their application to the present dispute by reviewing the 
agreement between the parties and determining whether it created any 
special entrustment or fiduciary control over the property in question. The 
Petitioner has produced a copy of Agreement No. T980365 (drawn on a 
stamp paper of Rs. 100/-) executed between him and Respondent No.3, 
effective from 01.07.2017. According to this document, Respondent No.3 
was the sole owner of TGP, which he valued at Rs. 13 million, including

Rs. 1,950,000/-. For this purpose, the Petitioner issued the following four 
cheques:

Clauses 1.2, 3.4, and 3.5 of the Agreement are relevant for our 
present purpose, so they are reproduced below in extenso: 
1.2  
Now in compliance of that mutual agreement, First Party is 
willing to transfer his 15% Share in business of “TG Pharma” to Second 
Party. 
3.4  
First party would be liable to transfer share in business to second 
party up to the payment actually received by the first party. 
3.5  
In case, any of the aforementioned cheques issued by second 
party dishonour, then clause (1.2 in subject matter) is not binding on the 
first party. First party will transfer share to second party in proportion to 
amount actually received.

As discussed, Respondent No.3 represented that the Petitioner 
was his employee (Sales Manager) while making the complaint to the 
Respondent SHO and subsequently while filing an application under 
section 22-A Cr.P.C. before the JOP on 09.04.2021. He concealed the 
Agreement on both occasions. During the proceedings on this 
constitutional petition, in C.M. No.4/2021, he changed his stance and 
levelled altogether different allegations against the Petitioner, as detailed 
earlier in this judgment. Since his application under section 22-A Cr.P.C. 
formed the basis of the Impugned Order (and resultantly this petition), 
Respondent No.3 cannot be permitted to take a stance inconsistent with 
what he then asserted.

Out of the four cheques listed above, Cheque No. 2400104340 
for Rs. 500,000/- was encashed. Respondent No.3 contends that no valid 
partnership ever came into existence because only one cheque was 
honoured and the remaining cheques were not encashed. This contention 
overlooks Clause 3.5 of the Agreement, which expressly provides that 
shares in the business would be transferred to the extent of the payments

actually received. The clause does not make full payment a condition 
precedent for the creation of rights; it envisages a proportionate transfer 
corresponding to the amount realized. Accordingly, upon receipt of  
Rs. 500,000/-, the Petitioner became a partner in TGP to that extent. This is 
notwithstanding the fact that no formal transfer of shares was made 
pursuant to Clause 3.5. 
32. 
 
Under section 4 of the Partnership Act, 1932, a partnership is 
constituted when two or more persons agree to share the profits of a 
business carried on by all or any of them acting for all. Unless agreed 
otherwise, the Partnership Act does not require that a full capital 
contribution or a formal transfer of shares precede the formation of a 
partnership. Mutual intention to share profits suffices. Although the 
Agreement dated 01.07.2017 does not expressly use the word 
“partnership”, its terms indicate a profit-sharing arrangement, including the 
Petitioner’s proposed 15% share in TGP. Clause 3.5 stipulates that upon 
partial payment, a proportionate share would be transferred. In the 
circumstances, Respondent No. 3 cannot deny the existence of the 
partnership altogether. At most, the dispute concerns the extent of the 
Petitioner’s share and the settlement of accounts, which are matters of civil 
liability rather than criminal culpability. 
33. 
 
The Agreement does not specify the Petitioner’s duties.  
Clause 4.3 merely stipulates that Respondent No. 3 will be the managing 
partner and that operational responsibilities, including the management of 
bank accounts, will be determined later by mutual consent. This clause 
indicates that managerial control remained with Respondent No.3 and that 
no exclusive dominion over the partnership property was conferred on the 
Petitioner. 
34. 
 
Although Respondent No. 3 has described the Petitioner as a 
Sales Manager, the documentary record, particularly the Agreement dated 
01.07.2017 and the admitted receipt of Rs. 500,000/-, contradicts that 
claim. Even if the Petitioner performed certain sales-related functions, his 
legal status remained that of a partner to the extent of the amount paid.

In view of the foregoing and the principles discussed above, 
the allegations made by Respondent No.3 do not establish the essential 
elements of “criminal breach of trust” under section 405 PPC, particularly 
in the absence of any special agreement conferring exclusive dominion 
over partnership assets. Moreover, the concealment of the Agreement 
before the JOP undermines the credibility of Respondent No.3’s 
application. The Impugned Order is, therefore, unsustainable. This petition 
is accepted and the Impugned Order is set aside.
