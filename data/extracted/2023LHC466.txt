Sheikh Irfan Akram and Mr. Saim Raza, Advocates, for 
the Petitioner. 
 
Mr. Muhammad Mustafa Chaudhry, Deputy Prosecutor 
General, with Ibrar/ASI. 
 
M/s Zafar Abbas Khan and Ghulam Murtaza Chaudhry, 
Advocates, for Respondent No.1. 
 
 
Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – Muhammad Iqbal lodged FIR 
No.333/2021 dated 20.8.2021 against Respondent No.1 at Police 
Station City, Bhakkar, for an offence under section 489-F PPC 
claiming that Respondent No.1 borrowed Rs.1,800,000/- from him on 
15.2.2021. Later, he gave him Cheque No.01044063 drawn on United 
Bank Limited, Bhakkar, for repayment of that loan which was 
dishonoured upon presentation. Respondent No.1 petitioned for pre-
arrest bail in the Sessions Court but it was denied. Then he filed Crl. 
Misc. No.64987-B/2021 in this Court for the same relief. Muhammad 
Iqbal and Respondent No.1 entered into a settlement during the 
pendency of that application. On 15.3.2022, Muhammad Iqbal 
submitted his affidavit in this Court stating the terms of compromise, 
which was placed on record as Mark-A. Respondent No.1 duly 
acknowledged it. Thereupon, by order of even date, this Court granted 
his plea and admitted him to pre-arrest bail. 
2. 
 
On 3.9.2022, Muhammad Iqbal died. His son, Azeem-ud-
Din (hereinafter referred to as the “Petitioner”), has filed the present 
application under section 497(5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
1898 (hereinafter referred to as the “Code” or “Cr.P.C.”), for 
cancellation of the bail of Respondent No.1. He contends that he has 

Crl. Misc. No.60014/CB/2022 
 
2 
 
failed to abide by the terms of the compromise and fulfill his 
commitments. According to him, on 15.3.2022 (the settlement date), 
he made partial payment in cash and undertook to pay the remaining 
sum of Rs.1,400,000/- within six months, but he has defaulted. The 
Petitioner argues that the bail of Respondent No.1 was conditional so 
it is liable to be recalled. 
3. 
 
This Court issued notice to Respondent No.1 who has 
made an appearance with his counsel. He does not deny violating the 
terms of his settlement with Muhammad Iqbal by failing to pay the 
remaining sum of Rs.14,00,000/- within the agreed period of six 
months. He has rather objected to the maintainability of this 
application. He contends that the Petitioner lacks locus standi to file it 
because he is not the complainant of FIR No.333/2021 and was not a 
party to the settlement dated 15.3.2022. 
4. 
 
The learned Deputy Prosecutor General has supported 
this application. 
5. 
 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
6. 
 
Chapter XXXIX of the Code sets out the law relating to 
bail. Section 497(5) provides for the cancellation of bail. It reads as 
under: 
(5) 
A High Court or Court of Sessions and, in the case of a 
person released by itself, any other court may cause any person 
who has been released under this section to be arrested and may 
commit him to custody. 
7. 
 
The Code does not prescribe any procedure for applying 
for cancellation of bail. Therefore, in The State/Anti-Narcotics Force 
v. Malik Amir (2005 YLR 1411), a Division Bench of this Court 
observed that the power conferred by section 497(5) was akin to 
revisionary powers under sections 435 and 439 Cr.P.C. The relevant 
excerpt is reproduced below: 
“Since no specific manner/procedure for filing of a petition for 
cancellation of bail has been prescribed either in Control of 
Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 or in the Criminal Procedure Code 
1898 and its section 497(5) conferred unrestricted powers on this 
Court and the Court of Session in case of a person released by 
itself or by any other Court, for his arrest for committing to 
custody. We are of the view that invocation of this jurisdiction can 

Crl. Misc. No.60014/CB/2022 
 
3 
 
be made on an application of any concerned person and, in the 
absence of any such application, by the court itself, whenever any 
lapse, capriciousness, or arbitrariness amenable to its jurisdiction 
comes to its notice. Powers of cancelling bail under sub-section (5) 
of section 497 Cr.P.C. can in no manner be restricted for any 
specific class of persons because such intention of the legislature 
does not flow out of those provisions. These powers are also 
similar to the revisional powers for which, as well, right of 
invocation is also not restricted.” 
 
 
Lately, Zafar Ali Shah v. Zakir Hussain and another 
(2018 YLR Note 124) has expressed the same view. 
8. 
 
I may also refer to two earlier cases. In Zahir Ahmad 
Suri v. Wazir Ahmad Chughtai (1969 PCr.LJ 1161), the High Court 
found that the applicant seeking bail cancellation was neither a 
prosecution witness nor a relative of the murdered man. It ruled that 
he had no locus standi to pursue the application and, therefore, asked 
him to retire. However, it continued the proceedings on the ground 
that the court is competent to revoke bail under section 497(5) 
Cr.P.C., even in the absence of any party’s application, when a 
perverse order comes to its notice. In Nazir Ahmad v. Latif Hussain 
and others (PLD 1974 Lahore 476), a learned Single Judge held that 
the High Court could exercise its revisional jurisdiction under section 
439 Cr.P.C. and set aside an order of a magistrate or a Sessions Judge 
granting bail to an accused if it is perverse. 
9. 
 
The question as to who can make an application for 
cancellation of bail of an accused has been considered in several 
cases. In Nazir Ahmad, supra, this Court held that in cognizable cases, 
the Public Prosecutor must be vigilant and petition for bail 
cancellation if he thinks the order is erroneous and unsustainable. 
However, section 497(5) Cr.P.C. does not explicitly state that only an 
interested person can move the court for cancellation of bail. In Nazir 
Ahmad, the High Court entertained the application because the 
applicant, in addition to being a witness of the alleged motive, was the 
husband of the woman who was assaulted and dishonoured. The High 
Court held that he was “a person vitally interested in the case.” In 
Khalid Mahmood v. Abdul Qadir Shah and others (1994 PCr.LJ 
1784), this Court ruled that a private person who has a legitimate 

Crl. Misc. No.60014/CB/2022 
 
4 
 
interest in the prosecution, such as the complainant or a close relative 
of the deceased or an injured person, may apply for cancellation of 
bail granted to an accused person. The learned Judge observed that 
being the “real aggrieved persons” they cannot be barred from seeking 
redress in a court of law. This is also necessary because the State 
frequently exhibits passivity in bail cancellation. 
10. 
 
In Saleem Akram v. Muhammad Zakir Khan Changezi 
and another (1979 PCr.LJ 972), the Sindh High Court cancelled the 
bail of an accused at the instance of the person injured in the incident. 
The learned Judge held that the State should have ordinarily moved 
for cancellation where the bail-granting order is perverse. However, in 
a proper case, an aggrieved private party should be allowed to have 
recourse to the law. In Dur Muhammad v. Bashir and others 
(1983 PCr.LJ 2053), the Sindh High Court ruled that a person 
allegedly injured in the occurrence, even if he is not the complainant, 
is vitally interested in the case. Hence, he is entitled to apply under 
section 497(5) Cr.P.C. for cancellation of the bail of the accused. The 
Hon’ble Judge dissented from the view taken in an earlier case, Nazar 
Muhammad v. The State and another (1977 PCr.LJ 277), in which 
another Bench of the same Court accepted the revision petition of the 
accused whose bail had been cancelled by the Additional Sessions 
Judge at the instance of a person allegedly injured in the occurrence. 
In doing so, the Bench had observed that the provision regarding 
cancellation of bail could not be made available to private parties to 
satisfy their grudges or use it as a means of exacting vengeance. 
Dur Muhammad was followed in Shaista Qaiser v. Mir Hassan alias 
Miro and others (2004 MLD 420). 
11. 
 
In Haji Behram Khan v. Akhtar Muhammad and  
others (1993 PCr.LJ 71), the Balochistan High Court distinguished 
Nazar Muhammad, supra, decided by the Sindh High Court, holding 
that it only discouraged frivolous applications for cancellation of bail. 
It ruled: 
“It appears that the learned trial court has misconstrued the import 
of the above report. Factually it aims at restricting and 
discouraging the tendency of misconceived applications of private 

Crl. Misc. No.60014/CB/2022 
 
5 
 
persons which may be motivated by the mala fide desire of merely 
satisfying grudges, vindicating their vengeance, or causing 
harassment to the accused person. It may further be noticed that 
plain reading of section 497(5) Cr.P.C. concerning cancellation of 
bail, as well as revisional jurisdiction conferred upon the courts 
under Cr.P.C. does not place any embargo on the private persons in 
pointing out grave improprieties committed by a subordinate court. 
Therefore, any person primarily interested in prosecuting a case 
against the accused cannot be restrained from knocking on the door 
of justice. It cannot be overlooked that public prosecutors, at times, 
show indifference to challenge a decision that may otherwise be 
defective. Therefore, outright exclusion of the aggrieved person 
from approaching the court of law in pointing out gross illegalities, 
misuse of powers or arbitrary assumption of jurisdiction by the 
trial court can be detrimental to the effective administration of 
justice.” 
12. 
 
Analysis of the above case-law shows that it is the State’s 
primary duty to ensure justice is done to the parties even during the 
bail process. No accused should be released on bail unless legally 
entitled to it. The Prosecution Department should immediately seek a 
correction under section 497(5) Cr.P.C. where the court has wrongly 
granted bail to an offender. Additionally, any individual who is vitally 
interested in the case and concerned with its outcome has a right to 
contest such an order. The court may also intervene on its own 
initiative if any lapse, capriciousness, arbitrariness, or perversity 
comes to notice. Section 497(5) Cr.P.C. confers powers similar to 
revisional powers under sections 435 and 436 Cr.P.C. on the High 
Court and the Court of Sessions. 
13. 
 
In the present case, the Petitioner’s father, Muhammad 
Iqbal, lodged FIR No.333/2021 dated 20.8.2021 against Respondent 
No.1 for the dishonour of the cheque. Now that Iqbal has died, the 
Petitioner is an interested party and competent to apply under section 
497(5) Cr.P.C. In the circumstances, the objection of Respondent 
No.1 regarding the maintainability of this application is overruled. 
14. 
 
Let’s now turn to the merits. This Court granted pre-
arrest bail to Respondent No.1 in Crl. Misc. No. 64987/B/2021 vide 
order dated 15.3.2022 pursuant to his compromise with Iqbal. He paid 
a part of the outstanding amount in cash and undertook to pay the 
remaining Rs.1,400,000/- within six months but has defaulted. Since 

Crl. Misc. No.60014/CB/2022 
 
6 
 
the bail of Respondent No.1 was conditional and subject to the due 
performance of his obligations, it must be recalled. 
15. 
 
In view of the above, this application is accepted, and the 
pre-arrest bail granted to Respondent No.1 is cancelled. 
16. 
 
Above are the reasons for my short order of even date.
