Petitioner by: 
Malik Javaid Akhtar Wains, 
Advocate. 
Respondent No.3 by: 
Mr. Shahbaz Murtaza Ansari, 
Advocate.   
 
Anwaar Hussain, J.  
The present as well as connected 
constitutional petitions bearing W.P. No.3387/2022 and W.P. 
No.8708/2023 are so factually inter-related and interconnected that 
they are simultaneously being adjudicated through this common 
judgment.  
2. 
Briefly stated facts of the case are that respondent No.3, 
namely, Mst. Aaisha Zafar (“the respondent”) instituted suit for 
recovery of dower as well as maintenance allowance whereas the 
petitioner instituted a suit for restitution of conjugal rights. Through 
consolidated judgment and decree dated 30.06.2021, the suit of the 
respondent was decreed in the terms that she was held entitled to 
maintenance allowance at the rate of Rs.15,000/- per month till 
subsistence of marriage with the observation that when the petitioner 
will transfer property measuring 12 acres of land forming Haq-ul-
Mehar of the respondent in favour of the latter, she will be entitled to 
maintenance allowance with 10% annual increase subject to 
performance of her matrimonial obligations. Through the said 
judgment and decree, the suit of the petitioner for restitution of 

 
 
Writ Petition No.15918/2021

conjugal rights was also decreed. The findings were upheld by the 
Appellate Court below vide judgment and decree dated 20.09.2021.  
3. 
The present constitutional petition is directed against the 
impugned judgments and decrees of the Courts below passed in 
favour of the respondent, inter alia, in respect of dower recorded in 
column No.16 of her nikahnama with the petitioner. The respondent 
initiated execution proceedings wherein, vide order dated 11.02.2022, 
the respondent has been held entitled to maintenance allowance till 
delivery of possession of the property to the respondent which had 
been transferred in her favour in compliance of the impugned 
judgment and decree dated 30.06.2021. Order dated 11.02.2022 
passed in execution proceedings has been upheld by the Additional 
District Judge, Multan, vide order dated 22.02.2022, and the said 
orders are under challenge in connected constitutional petition 
bearing W.P. No.3387/2022. In the execution proceedings, the 
petitioner also filed an application seeking direction to the 
respondent to submit surety bond against payment of the 
maintenance allowance to the respondent till decision in the present 
petition, which was dismissed vide order dated 07.02.2023 by the 
Executing Court and the said order was upheld by Additional District 
Judge, Multan in appeal, vide order dated 18.04.2023, which have 
been assailed in connected constitutional petition bearing W.P. 
No.8708/2023.      
4. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the entry 
recorded in column No.16 of the nikahnama was false and fictitious, 
however, specific issue was not framed in this regard by the Trial 
Court and no finding has been rendered as well. Contends that the 
interpolation in the entry recorded against column No.16 of the 
nikahnama was made in the terms that the property measuring  
2 acres (ایکڑ) was made to be read as 12 acres (ایکڑ) by inserting the 
number “1” immediately before the number ‘2’. Adds that the 
original nikahnama by the respondent has not been produced. Further 

 
 
Writ Petition No.15918/2021

states that even otherwise, the entry recorded against column No.16 
reflects that the property to be given was also recorded in a stamp 
paper bearing No.2095, however, the said stamp paper was never 
brought on record by the respondent and this aspect of the matter has 
been ignored by the Courts below. Regarding payment of 
maintenance to the respondent, submits that she is a disobedient wife 
as she refused to co-habit with the petitioner, therefore, she is not 
entitled to any maintenance. Adds that as per the impugned judgment 
and decree, the petitioner was only obligated to transfer the property 
and not to deliver the possession of the same or give share of 
produce, therefore, orders forming subject matter of connected 
petition bearing Writ Petition No.3387/2022 are not sustainable. 
Further contends that since the property stands transferred in the 
name of the respondent, therefore, the respondent is not entitled to 
any maintenance allowance unless she co-habits with the petitioner. 
Concludes that the Courts below have erred in not procuring the 
surety bond from the respondent for the maintenance already paid by 
the petitioner to the respondent. 
5. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent has fully 
supported the impugned judgments and decrees as well as orders of 
the Courts below passed in execution proceedings. Adds that though 
the property has been transferred in the name of the respondent, 
however, possession of the same has not been handed over to her, 
therefore, she cannot get her due share in the produce from the 
property transferred in her name and hence, she has rightly been held 
entitled to maintenance allowance till delivery of possession of the 
property to the respondent. Avers that the impugned orders forming 
subject matter of connected petitions are interlocutory in nature, 
therefore, the connected petitions are not maintainable.

7. 
The petitioner has questioned the veracity and credibility of 
the entry recorded in column No.16 of the nikahnama between the 
parties. Needless to mention that presumption of truth is attached to a 
registered nikahnama and the same can only be rebutted if a 
defendant (groom/petitioner in the instant case) puts forth some 
cogent evidence. The petitioner, in his written statement filed in the 
suit instituted against him, has categorically denied that any such 
entry pertaining to 12 acres land against column No.16 of the 
nikahnama was agreed between the parties at the time of their Nikah. 
However, when the petitioner appeared as DW.1 and was cross-
examined, he did not deny the said entry and never asserted that the 
disputed entry is result of forgery. The petitioner stated as under:

 (Emphasis supplied) 
Statement of the petitioner that he has not transferred the said land in 
the name of the respondent depicts that he realizes his obligation in 
terms of the entry recorded against column No.16 of the nikahnama. 
This aspect of the matter further gets traction as the petitioner also 
deposed as under:

A careful perusal of the above-quoted statement reveals that the 
petitioner is not denying the factum of settlement of 12 acres land as 
dower of the respondent but is merely asserting that the said dower 
was deferred in nature (ghair moajjal). Hence, the averment that the 
entry was result of interpolation is misconceived and accordingly 
discarded. In view of the said stance of the petitioner, there was no 
need to produce stamp paper referred in column No.16 of the 
nikahnama. Similarly, the argument that the dower was originally 
settled as “ghair moajjal” that was converted into “moajjal” is 
devoid of any persuasion. Bare perusal of the nikahnama depicts that 
there is no cutting and/or overwriting on the nikahnama converting 
the term “ghair moajjal” into “moajjal” as the same cannot happen 
without cutting and/or overwriting as one has to cut and/or erase the 
term “ghair” from already written word “ghair moajjal” to make it 
“moajjal”.  
8. 
Similarly, arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner that 
issue qua forgery has not been framed and hence, entire trial offends 
due process rights of the petitioner is also misconceived inasmuch as 
there is no explanation as to why an application for framing of 
additional issues/proper issues was not filed by the petitioner before 
the Trial Court or the Appellate Court below. Moreover, the 
petitioner, knowing the controversies, condensed in issues framed, 
led the evidence and both the Courts below have concurrently held 
against him and hence, he cannot now take a plea that proper issues 
were not framed. Even otherwise, said argument loses its significance 
and lacks persuasion on account of the fact that on the one hand, the 
petitioner stated that entry recorded in column No.16 is completely 
fabricated and result of forgery and on the other hand, while 
appearing as DW.1 stated that forgery was effected by making the 
term “ghair moajjal” into “moajjal” and further contradicted the 
stance by asserting that the words ‘2-acres’ have been made as ’12-
acres’. As a matter of fact, the case of the petitioner squarely falls 

 
 
Writ Petition No.15918/2021  
6
within clutches of the legal maxim “Allegans Contraria Non Est 
Audiendus” (A person who alleges things contradictory to each other 
is not to be heard) disentitling the petitioner to any relief. Therefore, 
this Court is of the opinion that the present petition is devoid of any 
force and merits dismissal.  
9. 
In the connected case bearing W.P. No.3387/2022, the 
petitioner is taking up a rather ingenuine position that the judgment 
and decree under execution has been implemented satisfactorily by 
transferring the property measuring 12 acres land in the name of the 
respondent and the said judgment never mandated the petitioner to 
deliver possession of the said property, to the respondent. Suffice to 
observe that a wife has a right to claim the dower and if such dower 
is in the form of immovable property, she is not only entitled to 
transfer of said immovable property in her name but also to utilize 
the same. Failure on part of the petitioner to handover possession of 
the property, transferred in the name of the respondent, pursuant to 
the impugned decree means that the said resource (property/dower of 
the respondent) would remain in the hands of the petitioner and the 
respondent has no control over how and when (and/or upon whom) it 
could be spent. Therefore, this Court is of the opinion that unless 
possession of the immovable property constituting dower of a wife is 
given to her, and/or the share of the produce thereof is paid, in 
essence, the obligation to pay the dower has not been discharged by 
the husband, which precisely is the position in the present case. The 
conduct of the petitioner of delaying the payment of the agreed 
dower and denying possession of the dower property and/or usufruct 
in form of the produce thereof, on the ingenuine and shallow plea 
that he was obligated only to transfer the land and not the possession 
reveals the contumacious conduct of the petitioner as to  
further protract and linger on the matter by involving, rather 
dragging, the respondent in uncalled for litigation that cannot be 
countenanced by this Court in constitutional jurisdiction. In case 
reported as “Haseen Ullah v. Mst. Naheed Begum and others” (PLD 

 
 
Writ Petition No.15918/2021  
7
2022 SC 686), the Supreme Court of Pakistan has held that once the 
dower is fixed, the husband in a marriage contract cannot resile from 
the same while observing that our society is male dominating and the 
men in discharge of their matrimonial duties often forget the 
commands of the religion when it comes to their own obligations and 
are more concerned about their rights. The present case appears to be 
a classical example where the payment of the dower due in favour of 
the respondent is being delayed by the petitioner on one or the other 
pretext. Therefore, the connected petition bearing W.P No.3387/2022 
has also no force.  
10. 
In view of the above discussion, the present as well as 
connected petition bearing W.P No.3387/2022 are dismissed. In the 
connected matter bearing W.P. No. 8708/2023, the petitioner has 
prayed that till pendency of the present Writ Petition No.15918/2021, 
surety bond regarding payment of maintenance allowance by the 
petitioner to the respondent be procured from the latter. Since the 
present petition has been dismissed and the impugned judgments and 
decrees have been upheld, therefore, the connected petition bearing 
W.P. No.8708/2023 has become infructuous, and hence, the same is 
also dismissed. The petitioner is obligated to bear the cost of 
litigation throughout.
