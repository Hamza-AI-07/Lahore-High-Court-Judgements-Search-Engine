AALIA NEELUM, J: - The appellant-Gulraiz Shahzad son 
of Muhammad Zulfiqar, caste Rajpoot, resident of Meraj Park Kot Abdul 
Malik, District Sheikhupura, was involved in case F.I.R. No.1087 of 2019, 
dated 31.07.2019, registered under Section 302 P.P.C., at P.S. Factory Area, 
District Sheikhupura and was tried by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, 
Ferozewala. The trial court seized with the matter in terms of the judgment 
dated 15.12.2020, convicted Gulraiz Shahzad (the appellant) under Section 
302(b) PPC as Tazir and sentenced to Death for committing Qatl-e-Amd of 
Muhammad Waqas Ali (the deceased), with the direction to pay 
compensation of Rs.2,00,000/- to the legal heirs of the deceased as 
envisaged under section 544-A of Cr.P.C and in case of default thereof, to 
undergo 06-months S.I further. 
2. 
 
Feeling aggrieved by the trial court's judgment, Gulraiz 
Shahzad, the appellant, has assailed his conviction and sentence by filing the 

Murder Reference No.03 of 2021, 
Crl. Appeal No.69125-J of 2020 
 
2
instant jail appeal bearing Criminal Appeal No.69125-J of 2020. The trial 
court also forwarded M.R. No.03 of 2021 (The State. Vs. Gulraiz 
Shehzad) to confirm the death sentence awarded to the appellant-Gulraiz 
Shahzad. Both the matters arising from the same judgment of the trial court 
are being disposed of through a single judgment. 
3. 
 
The prosecution story, as alleged in the F.I.R (Ex.PF) lodged on 
the statement (Ex.PC) of Sidra Bibi (PW-4)-the complainant, is that one year 
prior to the occurrence, complainant (PW-4) got marriage with Muhammad 
Waqas Ali and lived with her husband along with her father-in-law, namely, 
Zulfiqar, mother-in-law, namely, Riffat Ara and brother-in-law, namely, 
Gulraiz Shehzad; that on 31.07.2019 at about 04:00 P.M., complainant  
(PW-4) was present in her house along with her husband, father-in-law, 
mother-in-law and Gulraiz Shehzad (Jeth); that Gulraiz started quarrel with 
Muhammad Waqas Ali, husband of complainant (PW-4), upon which, 
complainant (PW-4), her father-in-law and mother-in-law tried to stop the 
quarrel and Gulraiz became furious and took a “churri” and made a blow of 
churri on the neck of husband of complainant Waqas Ali who became 
injured; that Gulraiz fled away from the spot while brandishing churri; that 
they took the injured Muhammad Waqas Ali to Shahdara Hospital, Lahore 
but Muhammad Waqas Ali succumbed to the injuries on the way.  
4. 
 
After the incident, the complainant reported the matter to the 
police through his statement (Ex. PC), and after that, formal F.I.R (Ex. PF) 
was chalked out by Jamshed Iqbal A.S.I (PW-7). After registering the case, 
the investigation was entrusted to Shah Faisal S.I. (PW-8), who found the 
accused/appellant guilty, prepared a report under Section 173, Cr.P.C., and 
sent the same to the court of competent jurisdiction. On 25.01.2020, the trial 
court formally charge-sheeted the appellant, to which he pleaded not guilty 
and claimed trial. In support of its version, the prosecution produced as 
many as nine (09) witnesses.  
5. 
 
The ocular account, in this case, has come out from the 
statements of Sidra Bibi (PW-4)-the complainant, whereas Dr. Ijaz Ahmad 

Murder Reference No.03 of 2021, 
Crl. Appeal No.69125-J of 2020 
 
3
(PW-2), who conducted the postmortem examination of Muhammad Waqas 
Ali (the deceased) found the following injuries on his person: 
INJURIES 
A penetrating incised wound 5 x 3 cm over the 
front of the left side of the neck, 5 cm above 
the upper margin (border) of the left clavicle.  
After conducting an autopsy, the doctor opined that death 
in this case occurred due to the injury to major blood 
vessels and vital organs (lungs), leading to hemorrhage, 
shock, cardiopulmonary arrest, and death.  
 
6. 
 
The learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor gave up PWs 
Zulfiqar and Riffat Bibi as being won over and Adil PW as unnecessary after 
tendering the Punjab Forensic Science Agency report (Ex.PM) and closed 
the prosecution evidence. 
7. 
 
The appellant was also examined in terms of Section 342 
Cr.P.C., wherein neither he opted to appear as his own witness in terms of 
Section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor to produce defence evidence. In response to a 
particular question about why this case was against him and why the PWs 
deposed against him, the appellant made the following deposition: - 
“Complainant and PWs are closely related to 
each other. They deposed against me just only 
to blackmail and harass me with a view to grab 
my property. I have no concern with the alleged 
occurrence by any means.”  
 
8. 
 
After evaluating the evidence available on record in light of 
arguments advanced by both sides, the trial court found the prosecution 
version proved beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt, which resulted in 
the appellant’s conviction and sentence in the above terms.  
9. 
 
We have carefully considered the submissions of the learned 
counsel for the appellant and learned Additional Prosecutor General and 
minutely reviewed the evidence on record.

10. 
 
After giving our anxious consideration to the facts and 
circumstances of the case and the evidence on record through which we have 
been taken, it appears to us that the commission of the crime by the 
appellant-Gulraiz Shahzad, murdering Muhammad Waqas, his real brother 
has been established beyond a reasonable doubt. However, Zulfiqar and 
Riffat Bibi, the father and mother of the appellant in whom presence incident 
took place, have not supported the prosecution case and have been declared 
as a hostile witness. The evidence adduced in this case is so clear that it is 
not difficult to hold that the appellant was guilty of murdering his brother, 
Muhammad Waqas. In our view, such a finding has been made based on the 
reliable and clinching evidence adduced in the case, and we find no reason 
to take a contrary view.  
11. 
 
The evidence adduced in the case reveals that on 31.07.2019 at 
about 4:00 p.m., Sidra Bibi (PW-4), the complainant, along with her 
husband Muhammad Waqas, Zulfiqar and Riffat Bibi, the father and mother 
of the deceased and Gulraiz Shahzad, the appellant, was present in her 
house. Sidra Bibi (PW-4), the complainant, deposed that Gulraiz Shahzad, 
the appellant, started quarreling with Muhammad Waqas (deceased), and 
Zulfiqar and Riffat Bibi, the father and mother of the deceased, tried to stop 
the quarrel but the appellant took the knife and gave a blow on the neck of 
Muhammad Waqas (deceased) and he became injured. Sidra Bibi (PW-4), 
the complainant, deposed during the examination-in-chief that: - 
“Accused Gulraiz Shahzad became furious and 
took a “Churri” (knife) and made a blow of 
Churri on the neck of my husband Waqas Ali, 
who became injured.”  
Sidra Bibi (PW-4), the complainant, further deposed that after the 
occurrence, they took Muhammad Waqas (then injured) to the hospital, but 
on the way to the hospital, he succumbed to the injury. Dr. Ijaz Ahmad  
(PW-2) deposed that on 01.08.2019 at 01:20 a.m., he conducted the 
postmortem examination on the dead body of Muhammad Waqas and found 

Murder Reference No.03 of 2021, 
Crl. Appeal No.69125-J of 2020 
 
5
a penetrating incised wound over the front of the left side of the neck above 
the upper margin (border) of the left clavicle. The death occurred due to the 
said injury to a major blood vessel and vital organ (lung), leading to 
hemorrhage, shock, cardiopulmonary arrest, and death. Dr. Ijaz Ahmad 
(PW-2) also deposed the dead body of Muhammad Waqas, brought by 
Muhammad Yaseen 1432-C (PW-9). Muhammad Yaseen 1432-C (PW-9) 
deposed during examination-in-chief that: -  
“Stated that on 31.07.2019 I was posted at P.S 
Factory Area. On the same day I joined the 
investigation of this case. I.O handed over me 
the dead body of the deceased Waqas Ali along 
with papers and two witnesses for the purpose 
of postmortem. I escorted the dead body of the 
deceased along with witnesses to DHQ hospital 
Sheikhupura for postmortem.”  
Shah Faisal SI (PW-8)-investigating officer deposed during examination-in-
chief that: - 
“I along with other officials reached at 
Shahdara Hospital where the dead body of the 
deceased Waqas Ali was present along with 
complainant and other eye witnesses namely 
Zulfiqar and Riffat Ara and seven persons. I 
took into custody the dead body of the deceased 
Waqas and prepared injury form Exh.PG, 
inquest report Exh.PH and application for 
postmortem Exh.PJ of the dead body of the 
deceased and sent the dead body of the deceased 
through Yaseen constable and two witnesses to 
DHQ hospital Sheikhupura for postmortem.” 
12. 
 
The above-mentioned prosecution evidence reveals that 
Zulfiqar PW and Riffat Bibi PW, the father and mother of the deceased and 
appellant, were present when the investigating officer visited Shahdara 
Hospital, but they did not report the incident. In our social setup, in-laws do 
not come forward to report the incident to the police when their children are 
involved. In the present case, one son (Muhammad Waqas) of Zulfiqar PW 
and Riffat Bibi PW had been murdered, and the other son (Gulraiz Shahzad) 
was facing a charge of murder. Usually, parents try to save their surviving 
child. In such a situation, when a woman’s husband was killed, and in-laws 

Murder Reference No.03 of 2021, 
Crl. Appeal No.69125-J of 2020 
 
6
were not standing by her, it was difficult for a woman to make a timely 
report of murder to the police. It is an admitted fact that Muhammad Waqas 
(the deceased) had not succumbed to injuries at the spot, but rather, during 
shifting to the Hospital, in injured condition, he succumbed to injuries on the 
way to the hospital. Dr. Ijaz Ahmad (PW-2) deposed during examination-in-
chief that the probable duration between injury and death is 1 to 2 hours. 
Thus, the time of the deceased being alive and dying would be between 5 
p.m. and 6 p.m. Sidra Bibi (PW-4), the complainant, deposed during the 
examination-in-chief that: - 
“I submitted application Ex.PC for 
the 
registration of F.I.R in police station Factory 
Area.” Sidra Bibi (PW-4), the complainant, also 
deposed 
during 
the 
cross-examination 
that, 
“Application was written by one present in the 
police station at about 6/7-PM --- We remained 
present in police station for registration of F.I.R 
for one/two hours. Dead body was present in 
the Shahdara Hospital at the time of drafting 
the application. The dead body was not taken to 
police station.” 
Jamshed Iqbal ASI (PW-7) deposed during examination-in-chief that: - 
“Stated that on 31.07.2019, I was posted at P.S 
Ferozewala as Duty Officer. The complainant 
submitted written application for registration of 
F.I.R upon which I got recorded formal F.I.R 
No.1087/19, u/s 302 PPC without any addition 
or deletion on front desk. The F.I.R Exh.PF 
bears my signature. I sent the said F.I.R Exh.PF 
to Shah Faisal S.I Homicide (Investigation) 
through Aamir Shehzad 752-C. " 
Jamshed Iqbal ASI (PW-7) admitted during cross-examination that when the 
complainant submitted the application for registration of the case, he was 
present at the police station. According to the police karwai endorsed at the 
bottom of the complaint (Ex. PC), it reveals that the FIR (Ex. PF) was 
chalked at 07:00 p.m. on 31.07.2019 through rapt No. 65. Shah Faisal SI 
(PW-8)-investigating officer deposed during examination-in-chief that: - 

Murder Reference No.03 of 2021, 
Crl. Appeal No.69125-J of 2020 
 
7
“Stated that on 31.07.2019 at about 07:05 p.m. 
an application and F.I.R was received to me 
through 
Aamir 
Shehzad 
moharrar 
for 
investigation.” 
Shah 
Faisal 
SI 
(PW-8)-
investigating officer also deposed during cross-
examination that, “I was in police station when 
investigation of this case was entrusted to me at 
about 
07:05 
p.m. 
after 
entrustment 
of 
investigation I directly went to Shahdara 
hospital instead of place of occurrence. I 
reached hospital at 07:35 p.m. I remained 
present in hospital for half hour, thereafter I 
went to the place of occurrence at about 08:30 
p.m. As per routine investigation officer choose 
to went to place where the dead body is present, 
therefore, I choose to went after the dead body. 
I remained present at the place of occurrence 
for 35/40 minutes I conducted whole the 
proceedings” 
13. 
 
The FIR mentions details regarding the date, time, place, and 
manner of occurrence, as well as the person who committed the offence and 
the weapon used in the commission of the crime. It simply facilitates the 
investigating agencies' investigation expeditiously so that they can reach the 
correct conclusion after the investigation. The series of acts and the 
proceedings taking place after the occurrence, as discussed above, reveal 
that the delay appears reasonable and probable and is in coherence with the 
normal conduct of a human being unless proved otherwise. Sidra Bibi (PW-
4), the complainant, deposed during the cross-examination that -  
“Accused Gulraiz and deceased Muhammad 
Waqas were only two brothers. Gulraiz and 
deceased Waqas has cordial relation. My real 
sister is also married with the accused.” 
14. 
 
The appellant did not participate in the last rites of his deceased 
brother, with whom he had great love and affection. The appellant failed to 
produce his wife in support of his plea that the complainant had not 
witnessed the occurrence and was not present at the place of occurrence as 
she was in her parents' house. The appellant took two pleas during the trial, 
and in his statement recorded under Section 342 Cr.P.C., one of his alibi was 

Murder Reference No.03 of 2021, 
Crl. Appeal No.69125-J of 2020 
 
8
that he was present at the head office clinic laboratories, Lahore, and second 
that he was falsely involved in the case by the complainant (PW-4) to grab 
property (house) of her in-Laws. The appellant failed to establish that Sidra 
Bibi (PW-4)- the complainant, or Muhammad Waqas (the deceased) had 
previous enmity on the property (house) owned by the in-laws of the 
appellant. Neither the appellant brought on the record any proof that his 
parents were the property owners, which Sidra Bibi (PW-4)-the complainant, 
wants to grab. There is no evidence that the appellant was present at the head 
office clinic laboratories in Lahore. In the cross-examination of Sidra Bibi 
(PW-4)-the complainant, nothing material has come on record that favors the 
appellant. The appellant has failed to examine himself as a defence witness, 
and the bald averments made by the accused in his defence without any 
evidence on record to support them cannot help the accused disproof the 
prosecution evidence. The defence taken by the appellant under section 342 
Cr.P.C. is not evidence at all, and it cannot be read as part of the evidence. It 
has to be looked into only as an explanation of incriminating circumstances 
and not as a piece of evidence. The accused has the option to examine 
himself as a witness, but when he takes a specific defense, he has to prove it. 
The appellant had not opted to appear in the witness box for cross-
examination, nor lead any of his evidence, which draws an adverse inference 
against him and leads to the conclusion that the version of the 
eyewitness/complainant regarding the manner of the accident is correct. 
15. 
 
The evidence of the eyewitnesses, corroborated by the 
circumstances arising out of the other materials on record, clearly establishes 
that the appellant-Gulraiz Shahzad had murdered Muhammad Waqas (the 
deceased) by inflicting a knife blow on his neck. The injury intentionally 
caused by the appellant-Gulraiz Shahzad, at the vital part of the deceased, 
was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. Given the 
above circumstances, we have concluded that the prosecution has proved its 
case against the appellant- Gulraiz Shahzad, beyond any doubt. However, 
we have observed the factors that have persuaded us not to uphold the 
capital sentence of the appellants as, according to Shah Faisal S.I. (PW-8)-

Murder Reference No.03 of 2021, 
Crl. Appeal No.69125-J of 2020 
 
9
the investigating officer admitted that he did not send the knife (P-2) to the 
PFSA as it was not blood-stained. The appellant has been convicted and 
sentenced to death for the murder of Muhammad Waqas, the deceased. In 
such an eventuality, the same can be considered a mitigating circumstance. 
Furthermore, though it is mentioned in the crime report (F.I.R/Ex.PF) that 
appellant started quarreling with husband of complainant and when 
refrained, he became furious/angry (شیط ںیم ٓاایگ) and committed the occurrence 
yet it has not come on the record that what and why was said dispute, 
therefore, immediate cause of occurrence remained shrouded in mystery.   
16. 
 
Based on the grounds discussed hereinabove, we believe that 
mitigating circumstances exist regarding the quantum of the appellant's 
sentence. Therefore, we believe the death sentence awarded to the appellant 
is quite harsh. It is a well-recognized principle that the accused are entitled 
to the benefit of the doubt as an extenuating circumstance while deciding his 
question of sentence. The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan holds it in the 
case titled “Dilawar Hussain v. The State” (2013 SCMR 1582) in which the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has observed at page 1590 as under: - 
“---It has neither been the mandate of law nor the 
dictates of this court as to what quantum of 
mitigation is required for awarding imprisonment 
for life rather even an iota towards the mitigation 
is sufficient to justify the lesser sentence. 
According to our estimation even a single stance 
providing mitigation or extenuating circumstance 
would be sufficient to award lesser punishment as 
an abundant caution. In such circumstances, if the 
court is satisfied that there are certain reasons due 
to which death sentence is not warranted, the court 
has no other option but to improve second 
sentence of imprisonment for life while extending 
benefit of the extenuating circumstances to the 
convict in a just and fair manner---.” 
 
17. 
 
In these circumstances, the appeal bearing No.69125-J-2020, 
filed by the appellant, Gulraiz Shahzad son of Muhammad Zulfiqar in FIR 
No. 1087/2019, dated 31.07.2019, under section 302 P.P.C, Police Station 

Murder Reference No.03 of 2021, 
Crl. Appeal No.69125-J of 2020 
 
10
Factory Area, District Sheikhupura is dismissed. However, the appellant’s 
death sentence is converted into imprisonment for life. The benefit of 
Section 382 (b) of Cr.P.C is also extended to the appellant, whereas the 
compensation amount, as well as sentence qua non-payment of the 
compensation amount imposed by the learned trial court, shall remain intact 
upon the appellant (convict).  
Murder Reference No.03 of 2021 forwarded by the learned trial court for 
confirmation of the sentence of death inflicted upon the convict fails, which 
is answered in Negative.
