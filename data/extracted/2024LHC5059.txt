Samina MehmoodPW-6/complainant, who while claiming herself to 
be the eyewitness of the occurrence stated in her statement 
before the trial Court as under:-  
“My husband Mehmood Asghar worked in Gas 
Agency. I have a daughter namely Zainab aged about 13 
years. Some days prior to the day of occurrence, 
accused Khawaja Tayyab (present in the court) teased 
my daughter Zainab. On coming to house, my daughter 
told us about teasing of accused. My husband Mehmood 
Ahmad admonished accused Tayyab. My dewar Yaqoob 
Asghar and Tariq Shahzad came to our house to talk 
about said matter. On 06.07.2022 I alongwith Yaqoob 
Asghar and Tariq Shahzad was standing in the street 
outside my house and were talking. At about 12:30am 
my 
husband 
Mehmood 
Asghar 
while 
riding 
on 
motorcycle bearing registration no.ABN/983 came from 
his work place i.e Gas Agency. When he reached the 
street near our house, in the meanwhile, accused 
Khawaja Tayyab while armed with pistol came out from 
his house and came in front of my husband. My 
husband tried to save him. Accused Khawaja Tayyab 
fired a shot with his pistol which hit on back of head of 
my husband, who fell down in serious injured condition. 
Accused Khawaja Tayyab fired 2/3 more shots upon my 
husband. Occurrence was witnessed by me, Yaqoob 
Asghar and Tariq Shahzad. On our hue and cry, 
accused fled away from the spot while brandishing his 
pistol. My husband succumbed to the injuries at the 
spot. 
Motive behind the occurrence was that Khawaja 
Tayyab was not having good character, who committed 
murder of my husband for admonishing him from 
teasing my daughter. Police came at the spot. I got 
recorded my statement Ex.PF which was read over to 
me. I marked my thumb impression Ex.PF/1 on my 
statement.” 
5. 
Tariq ShahzadPW-7 (brother of the deceased) while appearing 
before the trial Court has reiterated the same story. 
6. 
Statement of the complainant (Exh. PF) upon which FIR 
was lodged and endorsement of police at the bottom show 
that police reached the place of occurrence where statement 
of the complainant was reduced into writing. Contrary to 
this, complainant (Samina MehmoodPW-6) stated in her cross-
examination that application (statement/Exh.PF) was drafted in 
hospital; that was drafted at about 2:00 a.m. (FIR shows that it 
was lodged at 1:45 a.m. before the statement of the complainant Exh. PF). 
Nasir Waseem, SI 
PW-11/IO of this case stated in his 

3 
M.R. No.29 of 2023 
Criminal Appeal No.330 of 2023 
 
examination-in-chief that he recorded the statement of Tariq 
ShahzadPW-7 at the spot. Contrary to this, Tariq ShahzadPW-7 
stated in his cross-examination that he got recorded his 
statement before police orally which was recorded by the IO 
in the hospital outside mortuary at about 2:00 a.m. These 
contradictions are not ignorable, rather shatter the credibility 
of the eyewitnesses creating doubt regarding their presence 
at the time of occurrence at the place of occurrence and also 
negate the whole story of the prosecution.  
7. 
Rough and scaled site plans of the place of occurrence 
show the presence of the deceased at point (1) which is 
almost adjacent to the houses of Haji Khalid Rehman and 
Muhammad Hashim, who have not been produced in 
support of the story of prosecution. Complainant (Samina 
MehmoodPW-6) stated in her cross-examination that accused 
(appellant) was at a distance of 10/12 feet from her (them) at the 
time of occurrence which took place at mid of night. In these 
circumstances, identity of the appellant is also not free from 
doubt. 
8. 
Statedly, complainant Samina MehmoodPW-6, her Dewar 
Tariq ShahzadPW-7 and Yaqoob Asghar (given up PW) were 
talking to one another at odd hours of the night i.e. 12:30 
a.m. in the street and witnessed the occurrence but they 
have not disclosed the reason of their presence in the street 
at such time. Complainant (Samina MehmoodPW-6) also stated in 
her cross-examination that she had not got recorded in her 
statement (Exh. PF) that on which topic she (Samina MehmoodPW-6), 
Tariq ShahzadPW-7 and Yaqoob Asghar (given up PW) were 
talking while standing in the street. In these circumstances, 
this story of the prosecution is neither plausible nor 
believable, rather both the eyewitnesses have concealed the 
real facts of the occurrence which has not taken place in the 
manner narrated by them (Samina MehmoodPW-6 and Tariq ShahzadPW-7), 
such conduct of the witnesses is quite unnatural.

M.R. No.29 of 2023 
Criminal Appeal No.330 of 2023 
 
9. 
Both the eyewitnesses have stated in their statements 
before the trial Court that deceased was coming to house 
from his work place i.e. gas agency, reached the place of 
occurrence whereafter present occurrence took place at odd 
hours of the night i.e. 12:30 a.m. Complainant (Samina 
MehmoodPW-6) stated in her cross-examination that she has 
neither mentioned the name of gas agency (work place of her 
husband) in her application (Exh. PF upon which FIR was lodged) nor 
produced any proof during investigation in this respect. All 
this shows that reason of the presence of the deceased at the 
time of occurrence at the place of occurrence i.e. adjacent to 
the houses of Haji Khalid Rehman and Muhammad Hashim 
(discussed above) given by the PWs is false one, otherwise 
presence of the deceased adjacent to the said houses at odd 
hours of the night raises eyebrows. 
10. Dead body of the deceased was shifted to hospital 
through officials of rescue 1122. Neither any official of rescue 
1122 nor any report in this respect has been produced to 
establish the presence of the eyewitnesses with the dead 
body at relevant time, who statedly were with the deceased at 
the time of occurrence and shifting of the dead body through 
rescue 1122 from the place of occurrence, otherwise this 
story of the eyewitnesses is not believable. 
11. Recovery memos i.e. of blood stained earth, collection of 
crime empties and recovery of motorcycle from the place of 
occurrence do not show the name of the accused (appellant) 
which also create doubt qua the involvement of the appellant. 
12. Inquest 
report 
shows 
that 
Fazal-e-Rabi 
and 
Muhammad QasimPW-8 were present with the dead body at 
the spot but presence of the eyewitnesses around the dead 
body is not mentioned. Muhammad QasimPW-8 while 
appearing before the trial Court has also not stated that 
when he reached the place of occurrence, eyewitnesses were 

5 
M.R. No.29 of 2023 
Criminal Appeal No.330 of 2023 
 
also present with the dead body at the spot. All this shows 
that it was unwitnessed occurrence. 
13. Tariq ShahzadPW-7 is not resident of vicinity of the 
occurrence i.e. Mohallah Chaudhary Waris Khan, rather is 
resident of Mohallah Dhoke Hukamdad, Rawalpindi. He has 
not disclosed any reason of his arrival in the house of the 
complainant on the night of occurrence. He, being chance 
witness, has failed to establish his presence at the time of 
occurrence at the place of occurrence with his stated 
reasons. 2017 SCMR 564 “Arshad Khan Vs. The State” and 
2014 SCMR 1698 “Muhammad Rafique Vs. The State”.  
14. Considering the peculiar facts and circumstances of this 
case (discussed above), we are of the view that it was an unseen 
occurrence took place at odd hours of the night. Both the 
witnesses have not witnessed the occurrence, rather on 
getting information of the occurrence, complainant got 
registered the FIR after making statement in the hospital after 
due deliberation and consultation at much later stage but 
wrongly shown the time of lodging of the FIR i.e. 1:45 a.m. 
just to show it prompt one. 2019 SCMR 631 “Muhammad 
Arif Vs. The State”. 
15. Zainab MehmoodPW-10 (daughter of the deceased) stated 
before the trial Court regarding motive of the occurrence 
that deceased was teasing her whereafter her father 
Mehmood Asghar (deceased) admonished him, in response, 
he extended threats to her father for dire consequences. 
Admittedly, FIR qua the motive story has not been lodged 
against the appellant, otherwise such delayed story is not 
believable.  
16. Nasir Waseem, SIPW-11 stated in his statement before 
the trial Court that on 15.07.2022, appellant during 
interrogation disclosed and got recovered pistol from his 
house in presence of Tariq ShahzadPW-7 and Aamer 
Shehzad, who has not been produced in support of this 

6 
M.R. No.29 of 2023 
Criminal Appeal No.330 of 2023 
 
recovery whereas Tariq ShahzadPW-7 while appearing before 
the trial Court did not utter even a single word regarding 
this recovery which is not believable.  
17. In view of the above discussion, we entertain serious 
doubt in our minds regarding participation of the appellant 
in the present case. It is settled principle of law that for 
giving benefit of doubt, it is not necessary that there should 
be many circumstances creating doubt. If there is a 
circumstance which creates reasonable doubt in the 
prudent mind about the guilt of the accused, then he would 
be entitled to its benefit not as a matter of grace or 
concession, but as of right.  
18. For the foregoing reasons, this appeal is allowed, 
conviction and sentence of the appellant (Khawaja Muhammad 
Tayyab) awarded by the trial Court through impugned 
judgment are hereby set-aside. He is acquitted of the 
charges and directed to be released forthwith, if not 
required in any other case. Murder Reference is answered in 
NEGATIVE and death sentence of the appellant (Khawaja 
Muhammad Tayyab) is NOT CONFIRMED.
