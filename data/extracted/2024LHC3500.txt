                                          Mr. Fakhar Abbas, Deputy Prosecutor General.  
                                          Nemo for the respondents despite notice 
 
Solicitation is made through this petition for revising the 
order dated 04.12.2021, passed by the learned Additional 
Sessions Judge, Chiniot, whereby, complaint of the petitioner 
filed under section 3 of the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 
(the Act) was dismissed.  
2. 
Petitioner tabled the fact of the dispossession from his 
landed property before the Court in terms that out of total land 
measuring 1642 Kanals in Khata No.117 situated in Mauza 
Aasian, Tehsil & District Chiniot, he along with his family 
members is owner of land measuring 68 Kanals 05 Marlas, 
whereas, respondents No.2 to 6 are illegal occupants of land 
measuring 12 Kanals 07 Marlas in Killa Nos.21 & 22 of square 
No.28 and due to said reason, Khata No.117 was got 
partitioned with the consent of both the parties. According to 
which, 12 WANDA JAAT were prepared and the petitioner 
along with other family members were allotted WANDA 
No.07, warrant of possession was issued and after completion 
of such proceedings and depositing their dues in government 
treasury by the parties, respective possession was delivered to 
them on 10.09.2020. Further that on 03.10.2020 at 4:00 p.m., 
when the petitioner along with Murtaza and Qasim Ali was 
present in his land, respondents No.2 to 6 armed with hatchets, 
clubs and firearm weapons attracted to the spot, dispossessed 
him from land measuring 08 Kanals 18 Marlas situated in Killa 
No.21 and 3 Kanals and 09 Marlas in Killa No.22 (total land 
measuring 12 Kanals 07 Marlas) relating to said WANDA 

 
 
Crl. Rev. No.2454 of 2022.

No.07. During the occurrence, both the parties sustained 
injuries, upon which, respondent No.2 got lodged FIR No.458 
dated 03.10.2020 under sections 337-A(iv), 324, 337-L(2), 
337-F(vi), 354, 337-A(i), 148, 149 PPC at Police Station 
Saddar Chiniot against the petitioner and seven others, 
wherein, cross-version of the petitioner’s side was also 
recorded; petitioners’ party was arrested in said FIR and 
respondents party destroyed their millet and maize crops and 
illegally took over the possession of 12 Kanals and 07 Marlas 
land referred above.  
3.     Learned Counsel for the petitioner states that since 
3.10.2020, after dispossession, petitioner has been striving for 
return of his valuable land, deprivation is soulful and 
respondents while using delaying tactics have prolonged their 
illegal occupation which is adding insult to injury and even 
today, they are not before this Court. Learned counsel further 
states that learned Additional Sessions Judge requisitioned the 
revenue report which was based on the position of parties on 
08.09.2021 (though dispossession was ante-dated) whereby 
possession of 4 Kanal & 9 Marala land was shown in the 
possession of Asia Bibi, respondent No. 5, which prejudiced 
the mind of learned judge who held that this fact has been 
concealed from the Court, because neither it was mentioned in 
the complaint nor in the statements of witnesses, therefore, on 
this sole ground complaint stood dismissed. On the other hand, 
learned Deputy Prosecutor General states that learned Judge 
has not conducted the inquiry within the spirit of section 5 of 
the Act, and while responding to non-appearance of 
respondents before this Court, he has referred section 440 of 
Cr.P.C, stating that in criminal revision proceedings it is only 
optional with the courts to hear the parties. 
4.    Heard; record perused. 
5.   On receiving of complaint, private prosecution regime in 
vogue responds by recording cursory statements of witnesses 
by the Court to find out tentatively the commission of any 
offence. However, Court jurisprudence sometimes requires 

 
 
Crl. Rev. No.2454 of 2022. 
 
3 
 
conducting of an inquiry under section 202 Cr.P.C. with 
certain parameters including perusal of police record in 
connected state case. According to case reported as 
“MUHAMMAD JAWAD HAMID and another Versus Mian 
NAWAZ SHARIF and others” (2019 P Cr. L. J 665), it was 
held as under; 
 
“39. Section 202 of the Code bestows vast powers upon the 
court to ascertain the truth or falsehood of the complaint and in 
this respect as it could direct any inquiry or investigation and 
during inquiry it could examine the police file and final reports 
including report of JIT to come to a definite conclusion, as it is 
covered under the definition of material and if felt necessary 
may examine the members of JIT, I.O in a private complaint or 
any other witness recorded during investigation of said case so 
that complete picture of the occurrence supported by relevant 
material must be before him while passing an order under 
section 204 (for summoning the accused), so that no innocent 
person should face agony of trial and no culprit should go 
unpunished.” 
 
Further in a case reported as “MUHAMMAD IBRAHIM AND 
OTHERS versus QUDRAT ULLAH RUDDY AND OTHERS” 
(PLD 1986 Lahore 256), it was held; 
“Looking at the provisions of section 202 from all angles, in the 
event of an inquiry, the person conducting the inquiry should 
not only record the evidence of witnesses produced by the 
complainant, but should also examine the Investigating Officer, 
or, in the alternative, call for and peruse the Ziminis…………..” 
 
6.   It has been learnt that Courts while dealing with prosecution of 
complaint under illegal dispossession Act, 2005 follow a routine 
pattern to record the cursory statements of witnesses, ask for police 
comments and then make a mind to issue or decline process to the 
accused persons. Offences under the Act are non-cognizable, no 
FIR can be registered, and filing of a direct complaint is the 
remedy, therefore, if the offence seems not committed, Court is not 
bound to order for investigation as held by Supreme Court in a case 
reported as “WAQAR AKLI and others Versus THE STATE 
THROUGH 
PROSECUTOR/ 
ADVOCATE-GENERAL, 
PESHAWAR and others” (PLD 2011 Supreme Court 181), 
but if the commission of offence is apparent from the record, 
Courts must conduct an exhaustive inquiry or order for an 
investigation to get the relevant material collected for and against 
the commission of alleged offence, and should not go for trial mere 

 
 
Crl. Rev. No.2454 of 2022.

on the basis of cursory statements or documents uncertified. 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in case reported as “Mst. INAYAT 
KHATOON and others Versus MUHAMMAD RAMZAN and 
others” (2012 SCMR 229) has held that trial of an accused under 
Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 cannot be equated as trial in a 
complaint under section 190 of Cr.P.C. It is a special law may 
override the provisions of Cr.P.C, therefore, Court may order for 
investigation. That is the reason in year 2017, legislator felt the 
need for conducting of investigation and inquiry one after another 
and made changes in section 5 of the Act which is reproduced for 
reference;  
  
5. Investigation and procedure. (1) Upon a complaint the 
Court may direct the officer-in-charge of a police station 
to investigate and complete the investigation and forward 
the same within fifteen days to the Court.  
 
Provided the Court may extend the time within which such 
report is to be forwarded in case where good reasons are 
shown for not doing so within the time specified in this 
sub-section: 
 
Provided further that whenever a local inquiry is necessary 
for the purpose of this Act, the Court may direct a 
Magistrate or a revenue officer in the district to make 
inquiry and submit report within a period as may be 
specified by the Court. The report of the Magistrate or 
revenue officer, as the case may be, shall be construed as 
evidence in this case 
 
(2). On taking cognizance of a case, the Court shall 
proceed with the trial from day to day and shall decide the 
case within sixty days and for any delay, sufficient reasons 
shall be recorded.  
 
(3). The Court shall not adjourn the trial for any purpose 
unless such adjournment is, in its opinion, necessary in the 
interest of justice and no adjournment shall in any case be 
granted for more than seven days. 
 
(4) On conclusion of the trial, if the complaint is found to 
be false, frivolous or vexatious, the Court may award 
compensatory cost to the person complained against which 
may extend to five hundred thousand rupees. 
 
As object of the Act is to protect the rights of owner or lawful 
occupier, therefore, regime of law must be clearly understood 
to give a prompt response against dispossession, grabbing, 
controlling or occupying of the property without lawful 
authority. Spirit of above section requires that on examining 
the complaint and attached documents, Court may direct 
officer incharge of police station to investigate and complete 

 
 
Crl. Rev. No.2454 of 2022. 
 
5 
 
the investigation within given or extended period; which 
means that on receiving such direction by officer incharge of 
police station, chapter 25 of Police Rules, 1934 relating to 
power of police officers to investigate becomes operative and 
it shall be followed to observe all the processes given therein 
including recording of statements under section 161 Cr.P.C. of 
witnesses other than those whose cursory statements have 
already been recorded, if any, plea of accused, inspection of 
disputed site with spot recoveries if any, preparation of site 
plan or seeking technical assistance by any expert (revenue, 
settlement or consolidation officer) after obtaining revenue 
record and preventing overt act from any side or further 
dispute except power to arrest the accused without permission 
by the Court because offence under section 3 of the Act is non-
cognizable and Court is equipped with power to direct arrest of 
offenders as enunciated under sub-sections (2) & (3) of 
Section-4 of the Act.  
 
7.   Police can investigate the non-cognizable case on direction 
by Court in the same manner as meant for investigation of 
cognizable case. Part of relevant provision (Rule 25.11 of 
Police Rules, 1934) is reproduced as under; 
25.11. Investigation in non-cognizable cases. - (1) No police 
officer shall investigate a non-cognizable offence unless ordered 
to do so by a competent magistrate under Sections 196-B or 202, 
Criminal Procedure Code.  
 
(2) When an investigation in a non-cognizable case is thus 
ordered and is taken up by the police under Section 155(3), 
Criminal Procedure Code, it must be carried through in the same 
manner as if the offence were cognizable, except that no arrest 
shall be made without a warrant. In every such case a police 
officer making an investigation shall day by day enter his 
proceedings in a case diary and submit them daily as prescribed 
for cognizable cases in Police Rule 25.53. Case diaries shall be 
submitted through the gazetted officer concerned to the court 
which has ordered investigation. No copies shall be prepared or 
kept by the police. 
                            
                                                                                                         (Emphasis is supplied) 
                            
The above rule gives a clear indication that during 
investigation day to day proceedings shall be entered in case 
diaries which shall be dispatched to the Court and no record of 
such diaries shall be kept by the police. Rule 25.53 (2) of 
Police Rules, 1934 requires that case diaries shall be as brief as 

 
 
Crl. Rev. No.2454 of 2022. 
 
6 
 
possible; shall not be swollen with lengthy explanations and 
theories; shall be written either in English or in simple Urdu 
and only such incidents of the investigation shall be included 
as have a bearing on the case. Of course, on close of 
investigation, all the outcomes suggested in Rule 25.57 of 
Police Rules, 1934 shall be forwarded to the Court in the form 
of a report under section 173 of Cr.P.C., and then Court may 
decide to issue process against the accused or dismiss the 
complaint as the case may be. It has been held in case reported 
as “TAIMOR AHMAD and another Versus ADDITIONAL 
SESSIONS JUDGE and 9 others” (2018 YLR 81) that section 
4 of the Act can be equated with section 154 of Cr.P.C. and 
report under section 5(1) of the Act with the report under 
section 173 Cr.P.C. With a respectful dissent to above 
observation, it is held that section 4 can be equated with 
section 155 of Cr.P.C.  
 
8.   Investigation though provides material for trial yet its 
admissibility is always subject to rules of evidence and opinion 
of Court, therefore, legislator through section 5 of the Act has 
also taken care of this situation by introducing a concept of 
local inquiry which further empowers the Court that whenever 
a local inquiry is necessary for the purpose of this Act, the 
Court may direct a Magistrate or a revenue officer in the 
district to make inquiry and submit report within a period 
specified by the Court. Purpose of Act is as follows; 
 
“Whereas it is expedient to protect the lawful owners and 
occupiers of immovable properties from their illegal or forcible 
dispossession therefrom by the property grabbers.” 
                        
Thus, when the circumstances of the case are of the nature that 
Court deems it appropriate to obtain evidence, it shall order for 
such inquiry because the report of the Magistrate or revenue 
officer, as the case may be, shall be construed as evidence in 
this case as per second proviso of section 5(1) of the Act, 
therefore, appearance of Magistrate or revenue officer before 
the Court as witness is not necessary. It is the like inquiry as 

 
 
Crl. Rev. No.2454 of 2022. 
 
7 
 
conducted on the direction of Sessions Judge by the Magistrate 
or any other person as mentioned in section 148 of Cr.P.C.  
 
9.    Section 9 of the Act says that unless otherwise provided 
the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (V of 
1898), shall apply to proceedings under this Act; therefore, to 
better appreciate the situation at site Court can also go for local 
inspection as well at the stage of preliminary inquiry or during 
the trial. The relevant provision of Cr.P.C. is as follows; 
 
539-B. Local inspection: (1) Any Judge or Magistrate may at any 
stage of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding, after due notice to 
the parties, visit and inspect any place in which an offence is 
alleged to have been committed, or any other place which it is in 
his opinion necessary to view for the purpose of properly 
appreciating the evidence, given at such inquiry or trial and shall 
without unnecessary delay record a memorandum of any relevant 
facts, observed at such inspection.  
 
(2) Such memorandum shall form part of the record of the case if 
the Public Prosecutor, complainant or accused so desires, a copy 
of the memorandum shall be furnished to him free of cost: 
 
The practice of local inspection is approved by the Superior 
Courts and its evidentiary value is subject to the principles laid 
down in following cases; 
“Judgment of Full Bench reported as “KARAMAT Versus 
THE QUEEN” (PLD 1957 Privy Council 107): 
“MUHAMMAD SADIQ and another versus MUHAMMAD 
HUSSAIN” (PLD 1952 Azad J & K 13) “BAZAL 
AHMED SOWDAGAR versus NUR MUHAMMAD” (PLD 
1963 Dacca 852): “THE STATE THROUGH THE 
ADVOCATE GENERAL, PROVINCE of BALUCHISTAN, 
QUETTA versus JAMIL IQBAL” (PLD 1974 Quetta 
28)“ABDUL RASHID Versus THE STATE and others” 
(1999 YLR 1298 FSC): “Sardar INAYATULLAH KHAN 
versus THE STATE and 3 others” (2000 YLR 2803): “Ch. 
SAJID MEHMOOD Versus INSPECTOR GENERAL OF 
POLICE, I.C.T., ISLAMABAD and 3 others” (2015 YLR 
81):“ASFANDYAR and another Versus KAMRAN and 
another” (2016 SCMR 2084): “JAHANZAIB KHAN 
Versus SPECIAL JUDGE CNS COURT, LAHORE and 
another” (2018 P Cr. L J 354) 
 
10.   On receiving complaint, Court is bound to ascertain the 
truth and falsehood of the allegation, through inquiry and/or 
investigation. Inquiry and investigation are not mutually 
exclusive, Court can resort to both proceedings one after 

 
 
Crl. Rev. No.2454 of 2022.

another. Let’s see what is an inquiry and investigation, and 
when they be resorted to;  
                     
                     When Inquiry may be conducted 
An inquiry is made in order to determine the truth or falsity of 
a certain fact before an accused is charged with an offence. 
Object of an inquiry is to determine the truth or falsity of 
certain facts in order to take further action thereon; reliance is 
placed on case reported as “MIR SANAD KHAN and 6 others 
Versus THE STATE” [PLD 2014 Baluchistan 113]. An 
inquiry may start with shadowy beginning. During the inquiry, 
accused can be given opportunity to submit his stance and it 
would not be an illegality. Case reported as “ALLAHYAR 
Versus THE STATE” [1968 P Cr. L J 1526] is referred. Scope 
of Section 202 of Cr.P.C. is to hold a preliminary inquiry and it 
does not contemplate that a notice be issued to the accused 
person before issuing a process but If the Court holding such 
inquiry issues a notice to the accused before issuing process, it 
would not vitiate the inquiry. Reliance is placed on cases 
reported as “ANWAR ALI KHAN and others versus WAHID 
BUX and others” [1991 SCMR 1608] & “MUHAMMAD 
PANJAL Versus GHULAM SHABBIR JAT and 6 others” 
[2004 YLR 967 (LHR)]. In an inquiry, Court has to ascertain 
the truth or falsehood of the complaint which means that it 
would attend both aspects i.e., truth and falsehood.  
 
 
                 When investigation may be conducted  
 
Investigation starts when a police officer forms a definite 
opinion that there are grounds for investigation of a crime. 
Reliance is placed on case reported as “ABHINANDAN JHA & 
ORS. Vs. DINESH MISHRA” [AIR 1968 Mad 117] and it is 
meant for collection of evidence. On the similar principles, 
when any complaint is received by the Court, it starts inquiring 
as to ascertain the truth or falsity of facts contained therein; if, 
it comes to the conclusion that complaint is based on truth and 
an offence appears to have been committed, and sufficient 

 
 
Crl. Rev. No.2454 of 2022. 
 
9 
 
material is available to proceed with the trial, it issues process 
against the accused; but if it has no sufficient material or 
evidence, it can order an investigation for the purpose of 
collection of evidence. Court can direct inquiry or 
investigation one after another and its necessity can be 
summarized by explaining some situations in an inquiry and 
need for investigation thereafter, it is as follows; 
                                                             What is an inquiry?  
 
An inquiry is the process of reviewing an allegation to 
determine; 
1. whether the allegation is responsible; 
 
2. the particular law or laws that may have been 
breached; and 
 
3.  whether an investigation is warranted based on the 
information provided in the allegation. 
 
Below is a table describing examples of possible outcomes of 
an inquiry; 
Situation 
Outcome 
If 
the 
allegation 
is 
not 
responsible. 
The allegation is dismissed and 
the   matter concludes at 
inquiry. 
If the allegation is responsible 
but a breach of law is not 
substantiated. 
The allegation is dismissed and 
the matter concludes at inquiry. 
If a breach is substantiated, 
and the respondent accepts 
responsibility, 
and 
further 
investigation 
would 
not 
uncover any new information 
pertinent to the matter. 
The matter concludes at inquiry. 
 
 
If a breach is substantiated 
but the respondent does not 
accept responsibility. 
An investigation is initiated. 
 
If 
any 
issues 
identified 
through the inquiry warrant an 
investigation 
(e.g., 
other 
individuals in addition to the 
respondent involved in the 
breach; 
other 
possible 
breaches suspected). 
An investigation is initiated. 
 
 
 
 
 
                                 What is an investigation? 
An investigation is a systematic process, conducted by an 
authorized person for the purpose of determining the validity 
of an allegation. An investigation involves collecting and 
examining any evidence related to the allegation and making a 

 
 
Crl. Rev. No.2454 of 2022. 
 
10 
 
decision as to whether a breach of law has occurred.  
Investigation must be conducted when: 
1. the inquiry has not established whether or not a breach of 
law has occurred;  
 
2. a breach is substantiated at the inquiry stage but the 
respondent denies/contests responsibility for the breach; 
or 
 
3. additional issues are identified through the inquiry.  
 
The investigation process provides both complainant and 
respondents with an opportunity to be heard as part of the 
process of determining the validity of an allegation. This 
generally triggers rights of due process under the law on how 
to address allegations. That is the reason an investigation is 
necessary or essential because it is conducted for collection of 
evidence and parties have full opportunity to produce every 
sort of material legally admissible or not. In this way issues are 
narrow down by investigator with an opinion for and against 
the commission of offence and Court is loaded with tangible 
evidence as well. 
11.     In the present case, Court has neither conducted the 
inquiry properly nor ordered for investigation, so much so on 
the day of dispossession an FIR was also registered with 
corresponding cross version but Court did not even bother to 
summon the police record despite the fact that motive of the 
occurrence was dispossession. Court has also not attended the 
fact that possession was handed over to the complainant 
through warrant of possession issued by a competent authority, 
therefore, order impugned is set aside, complaint filed by the 
petitioner shall be deemed pending and learned lower Court 
after feeling the necessity either of investigation or inquiry, if 
any shall proceed with the complaint in due course of law as 
delineated above.
