complainant drives his personal truck and is residing with family members 
at Sikandaray Kund Shumali (دنکسرے ڈنک امشیل) ; on 01.07.2017 at Degar 
Wella (ڈرگیوہلی), complainant along with Muhammad Ilyas (brother), 
Muhammad Hasnain (son) and other women had come at Dera Lakbaian 
Wala              (ڈریہ ابکل ایئں واال) on death (وفیگت) of Mst. Ameer Khatun (mother-in-
law of said Muhammad Ilyas) whereas Muhammad Riaz son of 
Muhammad Nawaz, caste Awan, resident of Kathwai (وھٹکایئ), Ahmad Nawaz 
son of Muhammad Nawaz, caste Awan, resident of Nooray Wala (ونرےواال) 
were already present there; men were sitting in an open place on the 
northern side of the dera (ڈریہ) of Falak Sher whereas women were sitting in 
the courtyard  of the dera (ڈریہ); at about 6:45 p.m., Muhammad Ilyas 
(brother), Muhammad Hasnain (son) and Sher Muhammad (maternal 
nephew) son of Muhammad Nawaz, caste Awan, resident of Kund (کنڈ) 
were coming towards the courtyard of the house in order to lift the cot for 
giving bath to the deceased lady and when reached on the western side of 
veranda, Muhammad Tahir Ramzan son of Dost Muhammad and 
Muhammad Tanveer son of Muhammad Tahir Ramzan, caste Awan, 
residents of  Dera  Lakbaian Wala   Dakhli Kund ( ڈریہ ابکلایئں واال دایلخ ڈنک) who 
had already ambushed on the rooftop of their house with pre-planning, 
Muhammad Tanveer raised lalkara (اکللرا) to get ready (ڑگتے وہ اج ؤ) and made 
straight fire with his rifle with intention to kill, which landed at right side 
of upper lip of Muhammad Hasnain (son), upon which Muhammad 
Hasnain fell down; second fire was made by Muhammad Tahir Ramzan

Muhammad Riaz and Ahmad Nawaz, who were present nearby; 
Muhammad Tanveer, Muhammad Tahir Ramzan  while making firing went 
downstairs and fled away towards western side; the complainant along with 
companions attended Muhammad Hasnain, Muhammad Ilyas, Sher 
Muhammad (injured persons), but Muhammad Hasnain (son) succumbed 
to the injuries at the spot.   
Motive behind the occurrence as per statement/رفد ایبن (Ex.PO) was 
that Muhammad Tanveer was having suspicion that Khan Muhammad 
(brother of injured Sher Muhammad) had illicit relations with his wife; due 
to that grudge, both the accused persons after consultation inter-se made 
firing with intention to kill, committed murder of Muhammad Hasnain 
(son), injured Muhammad Ilyas (brother) and Sher Muhammad. It was 
stated that Muhammad Tanveer had also made firing at Sher Muhammad 
etc. about 5/6 months ago.

completion 
of 
investigation,

report 
under               
Section: 173 Cr.P.C. was submitted in the Court against both the appellants

Criminal Appeal No. 66363-J/2019 and 
Murder Reference No.245/2019. 
6
(injured/PW-9), Muhammad Ilyas (injured/PW-10) and Ahmad Nawaz 
(PW-11) whereas detail of investigation of the case was deposed by Ijaz 
Ahmad, S.I./Investigating Officer (PW-14); Prosecution after giving up 
Muhammad Sajjad and Muhammad Riaz (PWs) as being unnecessary and 
tendering reports of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PZ and 
Exh.PAA) closed its evidence; after recording of prosecution evidence, 
accused persons were examined under Section: 342 Cr.P.C. but they refuted 
the allegations levelled against them; they did not opt to appear as their own 
witnesses under Section: 340(2) Cr.P.C., however, Muhammad Tahir 
Ramzan (appellant) produced some documentary evidence (Exh.DA to 
Exh.DH/1 and Mark “A”) in his defence whereas Muhammad Tanveer 
(appellant) relied upon the documentary evidence produced by aforesaid 
Muhammad Tahir Ramzan.  
 
Trial Court after conclusion of trial has convicted and sentenced the 
appellants as mentioned above through the impugned judgment dated: 
15.07.2019. 
 
7. 
Learned counsel for the appellants have submitted that convictions 
recorded and sentences awarded to the appellants through impugned 
judgment are against the ‘law and facts’ of the case; ocular account is not 
trustworthy and prosecution has failed to prove its case against the 
appellants beyond shadow of doubt against the appellants; finally prayed 
for setting aside the impugned judgment and acquittal of the appellants.  
 
8. 
Learned Deputy Prosecutors General assisted by learned counsel for 
the complainant while supporting impugned judgment submitted that 
prosecution has proved its case against the appellants upto the hilt and 
prayed for dismissal of the appeal.   
 
9. 
Arguments heard.  Record perused. 
 
10. 
 It has been noticed that occurrence in this case took place at about 
6:45 p.m. on 01.07.2017, Muhammad Sarfraz (complainant/PW-8) got 
recorded his statement qua the occurrence at the spot on 01.07.2017 at 8:30 
p.m. to Ijaz Ahmad, S.I. (PW-14), who after recording the statement sent 
the same to Police Station: Saddar Jauhar Abad where FIR (Exh.PM) was 
recorded by Muhammad Zaman, S.I. (PW-4) at 9:10 p.m. on 01.07.2017; 

Criminal Appeal No. 66363-J/2019 and 
Murder Reference No.245/2019. 
7
medicolegal examination of Sher Muhammad (injured witness/PW-9) and 
Muhammad Ilyas (injured witness/PW-10) was conducted at 8:30 p.m. on 
01.07.2017 whereas postmortem examination over dead body of 
Muhammad Hasnain (deceased of the case/son of the complainant) was 
conducted at 11:15 p.m. on 01.07.2017, meaning thereby that case  
regarding 
the 
occurrence 
was 
promptly 
registered, 
medicolegal 
examination of both aforementioned injured PWs and postmortem 
examination over the dead body of deceased of the case were also 
conducted without delay which factors eliminate any chance of 
consultation, deliberation, concoction or procuring any witness. 
 
 
Ocular account produced by prosecution in the case comprises of 
Muhammad Sarfraz (complainant/PW-8), Sher Muhammad (injured 
witness/PW-9), Muhammad Ilyas (injured witness/PW-10) and Ahmad 
Nawaz (PW-11); reason for presence of said witnesses at the place of 
occurrence in connection with death of Ameer Khatoon (mother-in-law of 
Muhammad Ilyas/injured witness) was quite natural; they deposed 
regarding detail of occurrence in straight forward manner, remained 
consistent on material points, inspite of searching cross-examination, 
credibility of their testimony could not be shaken; presence of Sher 
Muhammad (injured witness/PW-9) and Muhammad Ilyas (injured 
witness/PW-10) who were having stamp of receiving firearm injuries on 
their bodies  at the “time and place” of occurrence, is beyond doubt; in this 
regard, guidance has been sought from cases of “MUHAMMAD SADIQ 
versus THE STATE” (2003 SCMR 736) and ALLAH DAD and others 
versus MUHAMMAD NAWAZ  and others” (2001 SCMR 1111). 
 
Occurrence in this case took place at 6:45 p.m. on 01.07.2017 within 
the premises of Jauhar Abbad (district Khushab), sunset time in that area 
on 01.07.2017 was 7:23 p.m. (see www.world-time date.com), so 
occurrence took place in daylight, accused were already known to the 
witnesses, so there is no question of misidentification of the assailants; 
complainant is father of Muhammad Hasnain (deceased of the case) and there 
is no reason on record that why he will substitute real murderer of his son; 
similarly nothing could be brought on the record that why Sher Muhammad 
(injured witness/PW-9) and Muhammad Ilyas (injured witness/PW-10) will 

Criminal Appeal No. 66363-J/2019 and 
Murder Reference No.245/2019. 
8
substitute the accused who have caused firearm injuries to them. In such 
circumstances, substitution of the real culprit is rare phenomenon; in this 
regard, case of “IRSHAD AHMAD and others versus The STATE and others” 
(PLD 1996 Supreme Court 138) can be advantageously referred, relevant portion 
from page No.143 of the same is as under:- 
“Undoubtedly, the substitution is a phenomenon of rare occurrence, 
because even the interested witnesses would not normally allow the 
real murderers of their relation to escape by involving innocent 
persons.” 
 
Guidance on the subject has also been sought from the cases of 
“MUHAMMAD AKHTAR versus THE STATE” (2007 SCMR 876), “SHERAZ 
KHAN versus THE STAE” (2010 SCMAR 1772), “NASIR AHMED versus The 
STATE” (2023 S C M R 478), “ALI ASGHAR alias AKSAR versus The 
STATE” (2023 S C M R 596) and “AMAN ULLAH and another versus The 
STATE and others” (2023 S C M R 723).  
 
 
So ocular account produced in this case by the prosecution is 
confidence inspiring and reliable. 
 
11. 
As far as medical evidence is concerned, same was furnished by              
Dr. Muhammad Arif Chohan (PW-1), who conducted postmortem 
examination over dead body of Muhammad Hasnain (deceased of the case) 
and issued postmortem examination report (Exh.PA); he also conducted 
medicolegal examination of Muhammad Ilyas (injured witness/PW-10) 
through MLC No.251/2017 (Exh.PD), issued final opinion regarding his 
injury (Exh.PF) and medicolegal examination of Sher Muhammad (injured 
witness/PW-9) through MLC No.252/2017 (Exh.PG) and issued final 
opinion regarding his injury (Exh.PI). Medical evidence has supported/ 
confirmed ocular account with respect to locale, nature as well as duration 
of injuries, kind of weapons used for causing injuries and other related 
aspects in this regard.   
12. 
Four empties of pistol .30-bore (P.15/1-4) and three empties of        
.8-mm rifle (P.14/1-3) were secured from the place of occurrence on 
01.07.2017 and same were sent to Punjab Forensic Science Agency, 
Lahore on 04.07.2017; Muhammad Tanveer and Muhammad Tahir 
Ramzan (appellants) were arrested in the case on 16.07.2017; on 
21.07.2017, Muhammad Tanveer (appellant) got recovered .8-mm rifle 

Criminal Appeal No. 66363-J/2019 and 
Murder Reference No.245/2019. 
9
(P.5) whereas Muhammad Tahir Ramzan (appellant) got recovered                
.30-bore pistol (P.7) in presence of Zafar Iqbal, S.I. (PW-12) and            
Jaleel-ur-Rehman, 238/C (PW-13), their testimony in this regard remained 
unshaken and said weapons were sent to Punjab Forensic Science Agency, 
Lahore on 24.07.2017; according to report of Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore (Exh.PAA), three empty cartridge cases of .30-bore pistol 
were found as having been fired from pistol recovered from Muhammad 
Tahir Ramzan (appellant) whereas 4th empty could not be identified with 
the observation that because of the absence of primer and lack of sufficient 
suitable corresponding microscopic markings, it was not possible to either 
identify or eliminate the same; similarly empty cartridge cases (C-5 to C-7) 
were identified as having been fired from .8-mm rifle recovered from 
Muhammad Tanveer (appellant); relevant portion of said report is hereby 
reproduced:- 
 
“Conclusion:  
 The item C1 to C3 cartridge cases were identified as having 
been fired in the item P1 pistol. 
 
 Because of the absence of primer and lack of sufficient 
suitable corresponding microscopic markings, it was not 
possible to either identify or eliminate the item C4 cartridge 
case as having been fired in the item P1 pistol. 
 
 The items C5 to C7 cartridge cases were identified as having 
been fired in the item R1 rifle.” 
 
 Said recovery has corroborated the ocular account.  
 
Thus prosecution has proved that Muhammad Tanveer (appellant) 
caused firearm injury to Muhammad Hasnain (deceased of the case) and 
committed his murder; also proved that he with intention to kill caused 
firearm injury to Muhammad Ilyas (injured witness/PW-10) at his right 
shoulder; similarly prosecution has proved that Muhammad Tahir Ramzan 
(appellant) has caused firearm injury at right foot of Sher Muhammad 
(injured witness/PW-9).  
 
 
13. 
Now coming to the defence version, Muhammad Tanveer (appellant) 
during recording of his statement under Section 342 Cr.P.C. in reply to 
Question No. 14, Why this case against you and why the PWs deposed 
against you?, stated as under: - 
 

Criminal Appeal No. 66363-J/2019 and 
Murder Reference No.245/2019. 
10
“All the PWs are closely related inter-se and are inimical towards me. 
Complainant was misled by one Falak Sher who is real “mamoo” of 
my father Muhammad Tahir Ramzan co-accused in present case. Prior 
to the present case my father had demanded share of his mother from 
above said Falak Sher. One Khan Muhammad, the real brother of Sher 
Muhammad PW had some money dispute with real brother of one 
Ghulam Muhammad my father-in-law. Hence, I have been falsely 
implicated in this case.”  
 
Whereas Muhammad Tahir Ramzan (appellant) during recording of his 
statement under Section 342 Cr.P.C. in reply to Question No. 14, Why this 
case against you and why the PWs deposed against you?, stated as under: - 
 
 
“All the PWs are closely related inter-se and are inimical towards me. 
Complainant was misled by one Falak Sher who is my real “mamoo”. 
Prior to the present case my father had demanded share of my mother 
which was being usurped by above said Falak Sher. One Khan 
Muhammad, the real brother of Sher Muhammad PW had some money 
dispute with real brother of one Ghulam Muhammad the father-in-law 
of my son. Hence, I have been falsely implicated in this case.”  
 
 
The aforementioned version of the appellants is mere a bald denial, both of 
them neither have produced any witness in support of their version nor 
themselves appeared under Section: 340 (2) Cr.P.C. in disproof of the 
allegations levelled against them; furthermore, documents (Exh.DA to 
Exh.DH/1 and Mark “A”) produced by Muhammad Tahir Ramzan 
(appellant) in defence and relied upon by Muhammad Tanveer (appellant) 
neither could cause any dent in the case of prosecution nor prove innocence 
of the appellants. Therefore, defence version is of no avail and when 
prosecution case is kept in juxtaposition with defence version, then it has 
been observed by us that defence version stands nowhere, however, 
prosecution version which comprises of ocular account confirmed by 
medical evidence corroborated by recoveries of weapons used during the 
occurrence, has been found as plausible and reliable, therefore, we have 
come to the conclusion that prosecution has proved its case against the 
appellants to the extent mentioned above  in paragraph No.12 beyond any 
shadow of doubt. 
 
 
14. 
So far as motive behind the occurrence is concerned, it was alleged 
that Muhammad Tanveer (appellant) was having suspicion that Khan 
Muhammad brother of Sher Muhammad (injured of the case) had illicit 
relations with his wife, meaning thereby that there was no direct motive 

Criminal Appeal No. 66363-J/2019 and 
Murder Reference No.245/2019. 
11
against the deceased as well as both the injured witnesses; furthermore, 
Muhammad Sarfraz (complainant/PW-8) clearly stated before the court that 
he, his son Hasnain and Ilyas (PW) had no any previous enmity with 
Muhammad Tanveer and Muhammad Tahir Ramzan (appellants); relevant  
portion of his statement in this regard is hereby reproduced:- 
 
“It is correct that I, my son Hasnain and Ilyas PW had no enmity with 
the accused Tanvir and Tahir Ramzan.” 
 
 
 
Even otherwise, any independent evidence was not produced by the 
prosecution during trial of the case in order to prove said motive. 
 
 
Now coming to the vital aspect of the occurrence, it is trite law that 
for proving common intention, there should be evidence to prove pre-
concert/consultation between accused persons for committing the offence 
and in absence of the same, attending circumstances can also be taken into 
consideration for deciding existence of common intention e.g. if accused 
persons having joint motive/grudge i.e. reason for committing occurrence 
against the victim, after consultation and preparation come from their 
residence or some place to the place of occurrence and commit the 
occurrence, then existence of common intention can be gathered while 
examining the entire facts but at the same time it is also relevant to mention 
here that  in case of presence of accused at the place of occurrence where 
his presence  is otherwise natural or at least not unusual/awkward e.g. at his 
home, question of sharing common intention has to be examined carefully. 
In this case, no evidence has been produced to prove any pre-
concert/consultation for committing the occurrence between both the 
accused/appellants prior to the occurrence; furthermore, both the accused 
have not come from their house to a distinct place situated at considerable 
distance and committed the occurrence rather according to own case of 
prosecution, they were present at the rooftop of their house at the time of 
occurrence and it goes without saying that in afternoon/evening of summer 
i.e. in the month of July, in villages, it is quite common and not unusual 
that people sit at rooftops of their houses; as per case of prosecution, 
Muhammad Tanveer (appellant) raised lalkara and then fired at face of 
Muhammad Hasnain (deceased of the case), also fired at front side of right

cause injury to Sher Muhammad (other injured of the case) whereas 
Muhammad Tahir Ramzan neither caused any injury to deceased of the 
case nor to Muhammad Ilyas (one of the injured of the case) rather caused 
single injury at foot of Sher Muhammad (injured mentioned above) without 
repetition. It is relevant to mention here that there was no direct motive 
against the deceased as well as both injured persons and even any other 
immediate cause of occurrence could not be brought on the record by the 
prosecution; these factors entertain reasonable doubt regarding existence of 
common intention between accused persons for committing murder or 
attempt to commit murder. Therefore, for safe administration of justice, 
while taking into consideration all these factors in totality and extending 
benefit of doubt, it is held that though occurrence has been committed yet 
not in furtherance of common intention between the appellants. Thus 
Section: 34 PPC is not applicable in this case and each appellant would be 
responsible for his own act; in this regard, guidance has been sought from 
the case of “NUR MUHAMMAD versus THE CROWN” (1969 SCMR 724).  
15. 
In view of what has been discussed above, prosecution has proved its 
case against Muhammad Tanveer (appellant) regarding committing Qatl-e-
Amd of Muhammad Hasnain (deceased of the case) by causing firearm 
injury at his face, therefore, he is convicted under Section: 302 (b) PPC. So 
far as quantum of sentence is concerned, we have observed that any direct 
cause of murder of deceased of the case i.e. motive against the deceased as 
well as immediate cause of occurrence for committing murder of the 
deceased of the case (as discussed supra) could not be established by the 
prosecution. Therefore, we are convinced that real/actual cause of 
occurrence in the case has remained shrouded in mystery. The law is well 
settled by now that if prosecution fails to prove alleged motive and 
immediate cause of occurrence then said failure reacts against the sentence 
of death awarded to convict on the charge of murder; in this regard, 
guidance has been sought from the cases of “NAVEED alias NEEDU and 
others versus The STATE and others” (2014 SCMR 1464), “HAQ 
NAWAZ versus The STATE” (2018 SCMR 21), “NADEEM 
RAMZAN versus The STATE” (2018 SCMR 149), “ALI BUX and 
others versus The STATE” (2018 SCMR 354), “Mst. NAZIA ANWAR

Murder Reference No.245/2019.

versus The STATE and others” (2018 SCMR 911),“NAWAB ALI 
versus The STATE” (2019 SCMR 2009), “AKBAR ALI and others 
versus The STATE and others” (2021 SCMR 104), “GHULAM 
MURTAZA versus The STATE” (2021 SCMR 149), “MUHAMMAD 
SHOBAN versus The STATE” (2022 SCMR 1608) and “SAJID 
MEHMOOD versus The STATE” (2022 SCMR 1882); relevant portion 
of latter case law is reproduced:  
“So far as the quantum of punishment is concerned, the learned 
High Court while taking into consideration the fact that the motive 
part of the prosecution story is not proved; there was no blood feud 
between the parties; what actually preceded just before the 
occurrence remained shrouded in mystery; appellant only fired 
single shot and co-accused of the appellant have been acquitted by 
the learned Trial Court, has rightly taken a lenient view and 
converted the sentence of death into imprisonment for life.                              
(emphasis added) 
 
Only single firearm injury was caused by Muhammad Tanveer (appellant) 
at the deceased without repetition, therefore, in view of accumulative effect 
of aforementioned factors, we  are exercising caution in the matter of 
sentence of “death” awarded to Muhammad Tanveer (appellant) by the 
trial court under Section: 302 (b)/34 PPC for committing Qatl-e-amd of 
Muhammad Hasnain and converting the same to “Imprisonment for Life” 
under Section: 302 (b) PPC, however, order passed by trial court regarding 
payment of compensation Rs.1600,000/- under Section: 544-A Cr.P.C. by 
Muhammad Tanveer (appellant) to the legal heirs of the deceased and 
recovery of compensation as arrear of land revenue as well as in default 
thereof, to undergo S.I. for six months recorded through impugned 
judgment is maintained/upheld; prosecution has also proved its case against 
him qua attempt to commit murder of Muhammad Ilyas (injured 
witness/PW-10) by causing firearm injury at his right shoulder, therefore, 
he is also convicted under Section: 324 PPC read with Section: 337-F(v) 
PPC and as a consequence whereof, under Section: 324 PPC he is 
sentenced to nine years rigorous imprisonment along with fine of 
Rs.50,0000/- and in case of default in payment of the same, to further 
undergo simple imprisonment for six months whereas under Section: 337 
F(v) PPC, he is sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for four years with 
direction to pay Daman amounting to Rs.150,000/- to Muhammad Ilyas

Murder Reference No.245/2019.

(injured of the case). He will remain in jail till payment of amount of 
Daman (mentioned above). However, his sentences of imprisonment shall 
run concurrently and benefit of Section: 382-B Cr.P.C. is also extended in 
his favour. Undoubtedly, Muhammad Tanveer (appellant) has not caused 
any injury to Sher Muhammad (injured witness), therefore, convictions 
recorded and sentences awarded to him under Section: 324, 337 F(iii) PPC 
with respect to Sher Muhammad in perspective of Section: 34 PPC vide 
impugned judgment dated: 15.07.2019 are hereby set aside and he is 
acquitted of the charge to the said extent only. 
 
 
So far as Muhammad Tahir Ramzan (appellant) is concerned, as per 
own case of prosecution, he has only caused single injury at non-vital part 
of the body i.e. foot of Sher Muhammad (injured witness/PW-9), which has 
been proved by the prosecution by leading cogent and confidence inspiring 
evidence, therefore, he is convicted under Section: 337 F(iii) PPC and 
sentenced to two years rigorous imprisonment with direction to pay Daman 
amounting to Rs.80,000/- to Sher Muhammad (injured of the case), benefit 
of Section: 382-B Cr.P.C. is extended to him, however, he is acquitted of 
the charge under Section: 324/34 PPC to the extent of Sher Muhammad 
(injured). Since, he has neither caused any injury to Muhammad Hasnain 
(deceased of the case) nor caused any injury to Muhammad Ilyas (injured 
witness, mentioned above), therefore, convictions recorded and sentences 
awarded to him under Sections: 302 (b) PPC with respect to deceased of 
the case as well as under Sections: 324 and 337 F(v) PPC with respect to 
Muhammad Ilyas (injured  mentioned above) in perspective of Section: 34 
PPC vide impugned judgment dated: 15.07.2019 are hereby set aside and 
he is acquitted of the charges in said regard. 
 
16. 
Learned Deputy Prosecutors General have submitted written report 
(received through Fax) prepared by Superintendent, Central Jail, Mianwali 
bearing No.20488 dated: 10.10.2023, which reflects that Muhammad Tahir 
Ramzan (appellant) has already served out the period of sentence more 
than the imprisonment awarded to him by this Court under Section: 337 
F(iii) PPC, however, he will deposit amount of Daman (mentioned above) 
within one month in the trial court for onward payment to Sher Muhammad 
(injured, mentioned above) and in case of non-payment of the same, he will

be taken into custody by the trial court and dealt with strictly in accordance 
with law for the recovery of aforesaid amount. Sentence of Muhammad 
Tahir Ramzan (appellant) was suspended during pendency of this appeal 
and he is present on bail, his surety stands discharged. 
 
17. 
Resultantly, instant criminal appeal is partially allowed in the terms 
mentioned above. Murder Reference No. 245 of 2019 is answered in 
negative and death sentence awarded to Muhammad Tanveer, is not 
confirmed.
