Crl. Revision No. 62123 of 2019. 
 
All the sentences were directed to run concurrently. Benefit 
of Section 382-B Cr.P.C., was extended in his favour. Against above 
conviction and sentence, accused/appellant filed criminal appeal No. 
77969-J of 2019, whereas, complainant filed criminal revision No. 
62123 of 2019 for enhancement of above sentence.  
 
2.  
Prosecution unfolds a scene of 23.06.2016 at 6.00 p.m. when a 
young lad of 19 years, Rabbi Umais sought permission from his father 
Muhammad Aslam, complainant PW-1, resident of Kundan Sayian, that 
he and his friends Zain-ul-Hassan and Hamid Ali are on invite for Aftari 
with some friend at Daska. They went on ride by motorcycle CD-70 
SJM-7155 Model 2013, colour red but did not return till late night. 
Complainant tried to contact him through phone, receiving no response 
went panic and started his search with the help of Muhammad Azam & 
Istikhar Ahamd, fathers of Zain ul Hassan & Hamid Ali respectively. 
Finally, early in the morning at 6.00 a.m. on 24.06.2016 one unknown 
person informed them of three dead bodies allegedly lying on bank of 
BRB canal near mouza Malianwala. Complainant along with above two 
persons went there and found the dead bodies of Rabbi Umais, Zain-ul-
Hassan and Hamid Ali. All had received firearm injuries on their persons; 
some spent shells were also found lying scattered near the dead bodies.  
3.  
FIR was registered at 7:15 a.m. on 24.06.2016, Investigating 
officer PW-17 reached to the place of occurrence, attended the dead 
bodies, prepared injury statements, inquest reports and sent them for 
postmortem examination. He claimed spot recoveries like some hair in 
clenched palm of Rabbi Umais, one shoe of left foot (allegedly of 
accused), 3 set of shoes & two mufflers (of deceased persons), thirteen 
spent shells of pistol, motorcycle, broken mobile of Rabbi Umais and 
blood-stained earth. Crime scene and dead bodies were photographed on 
his direction by Tayyab Luqman PW-3 and snaps handed over by him 
were taken into possession on 27.06.2016. On 30.06.2016 Yasir Abass 
579-C computer operator Police station Bambanwala handed over CDR 
of phone numbers 0334-7941801 w.e.f. 21.06.2016 to 23.06.2016; phone 
number 0348-1472673w.e.f. 01.04.2016 to 23.06.2016; phone number 
0348-8636799 w.e.f. 01.04.2016 to 23.06.2016. Blood-stained earth, 
Hair, and Swabs taken from inside the shoe, as well as spent shells were 

3 
Crl. Appeal No. 77969-J of 2019 &  
Crl. Revision No. 62123 of 2019. 
 
sent to PFSA on 28.06.2016. Through first supplementary statement of 
the complainant on 24.06.2016, accused/appellant, his father Khalid and 
four unknowns were suspected to be involved in commission of offence 
yet second supplementary statement bracketed (1) Adil (2) Malik Shakeel 
(3) Mubashir (4) Hafiz Usman (5) Shabbir and (6) Sunaina; however, 
except Adil (PO), Khalid and later nominated accused were exonerated 
during the investigation, neither challaned nor summoned by the Court.  
Accused/appellant‟s arrest was shown on 14.09.2016 and later on 
16.09.2016, for his DNA analysis and polygraph test, he was taken to 
PFSA. On 18.09.2016, accused/appellant led to the recovery of 
motorcycle (P-14) used by him during the occurrence and second shoe 
(P-15) from house of his uncle Malik Shabbir situated at Street No. 5, 
Pasrur road, Daska. Both shoes were got identified from Muhammad 
Azam and Istikhar PWs who claimed them of one person. On 27.09.2016 
accused/appellant pointed out the place of murder. On 28.09.2016 
accused/appellant led to the recovery of pistol .30 bore (P-10) from the 
same house of his uncle. PFSA reports returned with opinion of 
identification of human blood on earth sent for analysis, DNA profile 
obtained from hair and swabs taken from inside of shoe was declared 
consistent with DNA profile of accused/appellant. Pistol sent to PFSA 
was found wedded with spent shells. An attempt for polygraph test stood 
failed because accused allegedly confessed his guilt before the expert on 
16.09.2016; such confession was claimed to have been recorded 
separately by the expert as reflected from PFSA report Exh. PQQ. Finally 
Report under section 173 Cr.P.C was put into the Court. 
4.         Prosecution examined, as many as, twenty PWs including 
witnesses of last seen, namely, Muhammad Nadeem (PW-7) and 
Muhammad Imran (PW-8). After close of prosecution evidence, the 
appellant was examined under Section 342 Cr.P.C., and he while 
responding to a question that why this case is against him and why PWs 
deposed against him? has stated as under:  
“All the witnesses are inter-se related. They have involved me in this 
case merely on the basis of suspicions. In fact at the time of occurrence I 
was not present at place of occurrence. I have been falsely roped in this 
case. I am innocent.”  

4 
Crl. Appeal No. 77969-J of 2019 &  
Crl. Revision No. 62123 of 2019. 
 
The appellant neither appeared as his own witness in terms of Section 
340(2) Cr.P.C., nor produced documentary evidence, and the trial ended 
in the terms as detailed above. 
5.  
Learned proponent and opponent were heard at length while 
examining the whole evidence.  
6.  
Case of the prosecution was structured through last seen 
evidence as a first clue for the involvement of accused/appellant, which 
was deposed by Muhammad Nadeem (PW-7) and Muhammad Imran 
(PW-8), cousins inter se and relative of complainant. Nadeem was a fruit 
vender and Imran a property dealer. Both stated that on 23.06.2016 at 
8.30 p.m. they went to Ramzan town for business work of Imran. They 
were on walk over the bank of BRB Canal near Stadium and Ramzan 
town when saw deceased persons riding on motor cycle were going on 
the western bank of canal and just after them saw accused/appellant on 
another motorcycle. After some time, they saw accused/ appellant 
coming back alone on his motorcycle being driven rashly.  
          It was admitted by them that they informed the complainant about 
this fact on 25.06.2016 (after two days). This delayed information was 
with the justification that they came back from Multan together on the 
said date but no proof of their being gone to Multan was produced on the 
record.  
          PW-7 was simply a fruit vender and had no hand or share in 
property business of Imran. His presence in the month of Ramadhan at 
8.30 p.m. in Ramzan town for the purpose of observing an activity of 
plotting is nothing but a story.  
         It was an occurrence in the month of June and both the witnesses 
are not expected to there at 8.30 p.m., that too in the month of Ramadhan 
when Muslims are busy in offering their Esha prayer followed by 
Taravih. It has further come in the evidence that there was no mosque in 
Ramzan town that could justify that after offering Esha prayer they were 
on walk from Ramzan town to bank of canal which was allegedly at a 
distance of ½ kilometer. However, site plan does not indicate any road 
leading to Stadium or the Ramzan town. Both the witnesses neither have 

5 
Crl. Appeal No. 77969-J of 2019 &  
Crl. Revision No. 62123 of 2019. 
 
shown their place of presence to the police nor police has sketched or 
photographed that place.  
         As per statement of PW-7, they did not go to western bank of canal; 
no proof of light on the western bank of canal though claimed street 
lights on their side. He was not resident of locality where 
accused/appellant resided, however, claimed that his cousin Imran was 
married in the locality of accused/appellant but he knew nothing about 
the father of accused/appellant. From the above facts if a little 
acquittance of this witness with accused/appellant is conceded, he is not 
expected to have identified the accused from a distance with intervening 
BRB canal and that too in dark night, because source of light they 
deposed was at distance of ½ kilometer at Ramazan town and nearby 
hospital.  
           Testimony of PW-7 does not inspire confidence and I have 
reached to the conclusion that his presence at acclaimed place was highly 
doubtful due to above highlighted facts and the followings; 
He conceded that no body met them during their walk on the bank of 
canal and admitted that no persons were gathered at that time to make 
a plan of Ramzan town. He specifically stated that at 8.30 p.m. except 
them, no other person was present. It was also deposed that the person 
whom Imran PW had come to meet was not produced before the 
investigating officer nor security guard of Ramzan town was 
associated into investigation.  
 
7.    PW-8 Mohammad Imran for his presence at Ramzan town, deposed 
as under; 
“One Asif Ilyas, one of my friend, who used to deal in property 
business, apprised me regarding plotting of Ramazan Town. We 
went at Ramazan Town for the purpose of planning of the 
plotting at 8.00 p.m. None other was present there, at that time. I 
do not know the name of owner/proprietor of Ramzan Town.”  
 
He admitted it correct that during the period at BRB canal, none from the 
public met them, none of the vehicle was passing thereby at the relevant 
time. He also conceded that he does not know the person whom they 
visited at Multan. Surprisingly, they made the statement on 25.06.2016 to 
the police but complainant had already nominated the accused/appellant 
on 24.06.2016. As per his testimony, he had received information of 
murders on 24.06.2016 but did not contact the complainant (his maternal 

6 
Crl. Appeal No. 77969-J of 2019 &  
Crl. Revision No. 62123 of 2019. 
 
uncle) or PWs namely Muhammad Azam & Istikhar on phone on the said 
day despite the fact his two brothers Luqman & Irfan were also witnesses 
in this case. It is clear from the above facts that present two witnesses 
were installed by the prosecution in support of hunch of the complainant 
who was suspecting involvement of accused/appellant. These witnesses 
have not seen any weapon in the hand of accused/appellant, nor claimed 
seeing the accused/appellant coming back on motorcycle without left 
shoe in his foot. Prosecution has not opted to procure CDR of these 
witnesses to justify their acclaimed presence near BRB Canal at the 
relevant time.  Last but not the least they have not seen the commission 
of murder by the accused/appellant.  
8.    Circumstantial evidence, in the form of DNA matching with some 
hair in the clenched palm of one of the deceased and on swabs taken from 
shoe, is mind-boggling evidence and raises many question that how such 
evidence was collected and procured by the police. The first eye brow 
raiser is the situation in which dead bodies were lying on the place of 
occurrence. An impression was created that deceased were targeted when 
they were on motorcycle and after sustaining injuries they fell down on 
the ground, because snaps of place of murder as well as statements of 
PWs show that motorcycle was lying over the dead body of one of the 
deceased, but surprisingly no blood spots or splashing on the motorcycle 
were found, which fact was conceded by investigating officer PW-17 as 
under; 
“There was no scratches on the motorcycle. I do not remember 
that there was any stain of blood on motorbike. I have not 
mentioned in Exh. PI, i.e., recovery memo of motorcycle that 
motorcycle was blood stained.” 
 
Furthermore, doctor has also not observed any injury on the body of 
deceased due to fall from motorcycle. Doctor has also observed no 
blackening or burning around the injuries of any of the deceased which 
shows that deceased were hit from quite a distance. When the accused 
was not within the reach of deceased, some hair in the clenched palm of 
Rabbi Umais deceased has no meanings. Similarly, when nobody has 
seen the accused while committing murder, showing running of accused 

7 
Crl. Appeal No. 77969-J of 2019 &  
Crl. Revision No. 62123 of 2019. 
 
in haste while leaving his left shoe at the place of occurrence is a story 
that may not find a buyer.  
 Tayyab Luqman 1039/C PW-3, on call reached the place of occurrence, 
and photographed the dead bodies (Exh.PB/1-20). When he was asked 
about hair in the clenched palm of Rabbi Umais; he responded as under; 
“None of the pictures (P1-P20) shows the recovery of human 
hairs from the fist of Rabi Umais deceased.”   
 
PW-17 Muhammad Akhtar Inspector, the first investigator admitted 
during cross examination as under; 
“It is correct that there is no reference of capturing hair by dead 
body of Rabbi Umais in his injury statement prepared by me. It 
is correct that no photograph of fist of Rabbi Umais was 
captured, wherein, he was carrying hair.”  
 
I have also examined the snaps P1-P20, which show that every effort has 
been made to develop the pictures in a form so as to conceal the hands of 
Rabbi Umais deceased. I have also not found in said snaps any shoe near 
or around the dead bodies of deceased persons. Thus, above evidence was 
created to book the accused/appellant. 
9.  
Identification 
and 
comparison of 
recovered 
shoes 
of 
accuses/appellant was yet another issue with the prosecution. 
Investigating officer PW-17 deposed that on 19.09.2016, he was present 
in HIU Office Daska when two witnesses namely Azam and Istikhar 
appeared before him and joined the investigation whom he had shown 
one right shoe of rubber leather which was recovered by him on the lead 
of accused/appellant. After comparison and identification by the PWs 
that both shoes are of same person, he prepared Memo of identification 
duly signed by the PWs. I am afraid this arrangement for identification of 
shoes is not recognized by law, particularly when investigating officer 
admitted during cross examination as under; 
“The chappal of rubber/chamra was not got comparison by me 
from the accused.” 
                 And also; 
 “I cannot tell the size and company of rubber shoe P7.” 
                        

8 
Crl. Appeal No. 77969-J of 2019 &  
Crl. Revision No. 62123 of 2019. 
 
Investigating officer has not recorded the statement of any witness who 
could have deposed about the fact they had seen the accused/appellant 
wearing such shoes on such & such occasion. In a case reported as 
“MEHR ALI AND OTHERS Versus THE STATE” (1968 SCMR 161), 
Supreme Court of Pakistan believed such evidence only when cobbler 
appeared as witness for identification of shoe with the explanation that 
accused got it repaired from him, and a supervisor also appeared who had 
seen the accused wearing such shoe at work place.   
          Even otherwise, the law on the subject is very clear that if no 
witness as referred above was available then shoes must have been 
examined by an expert to know about its size to be fit in the feet of 
accused. Case reported as “MUHAMMAD TAYYAB and another Versus The 
STATE and others” (2023 YLR 2207) is referred. It has been held in a case 
reported as “THE STATE Versus ZAFAR AHMAD ETC.” (K.L.R 1991 
Criminal Cases 418) that such shoe had no special features rather was of 
common pattern, therefore, it hardly connects the accused with the crime. 
Similarly, in a case reported as “QAMAR ABBAS SHAH versus THE 
STATE” (2012 YLR 2663), it was commented that there are so many 
shoes of the same company owned by many other persons. Thus, 
prosecution has failed to prove that recovered shoes belong to the 
accused/appellant.  
10.       Mr. Hassan Anwaar Pannun, learned counsel for the appellant has 
very elegantly pointed out the fabrication of above evidence while 
claiming that in fact accused/appellant was arrested on the day of 
occurrence and his hair and shoe were used to provide evidence in this 
unwitnessed occurrence. Learned counsel for the appellant regarded it a 
tunnel vision, a practice inherent in police whose ideology speaks that 
“accused is guilty until proven innocent”, therefore they book the 
offender on the hunch and then start creating evidence in support of their 
bias. Learned counsel in this respect has referred the portion of cross 
examination on some prosecution witnesses. According to him, PW-1 
Muhammad Aslam, complainant deposed as under; 
“It is correct that Adil was arrested in this case by the police 
on the night of Janaza. It is correct that on the same day, 
Usama accused was also arrested. It is correct that formal 

9 
Crl. Appeal No. 77969-J of 2019 &  
Crl. Revision No. 62123 of 2019. 
 
arrest of Usama was not shown by the police for three 
months.”                                              
                                                                    (Emphasis supplied) 
 
PW-13 Muhammad Afzal, who had identified the dead body of Zain 
ul Hassan had responded, the question asked about arrest of accused, 
as under; 
“I cannot tell that accused Rahat Saleem was arrested from 
Janaza, volunteered that a person was arrested but I do not 
know about his name.” 
 
PW-18 Muhammad Baqir Inspector, 2nd investigator deposed as 
under; 
“The first IO might have arrested accused Usama on the basis 
of suspicion but I do not know about it.”  
 
He conceded that he did not join into investigation the earlier 
investigator.  
          The above highlights further get strength from the fact that no 
investigating officer deposed before the court that any process like 
warrants 
or 
proclamation 
was 
ever 
issued 
against 
the 
accused/appellant for his arrest despite the fact he allegedly remained 
out of reach by the police for three months. Thus, it is clear that 
accused was arrested on the same day and police was in a position to 
create the evidence, as made available in this case.  
 
11. 
 
Prosecution has claimed that accused appellant also 
pointed out the place of murder of the deceased which is relevant 
evidence. I am afraid this fact was already in the notice of prosecution 
and cannot be regarded as a fact in the exclusive knowledge of the 
accused/appellant and was discovered only on his information so as to 
make it admissible evidence under Article 40 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order 1984. Thus, this piece of evidence cannot be read 
against him. 
12. 
Mr. Hassan Anwaar Pannun, learned counsel for the appellant 
while sharing his gut feelings stated that in fact place of commission 
of murder is different from place where dead bodies of deceased were 
found. It seems that dead bodies along with spent shells and 

10 
Crl. Appeal No. 77969-J of 2019 &  
Crl. Revision No. 62123 of 2019. 
 
motorcycle were placed in order to mislead and distract the police; 
had it been an occurrence at 10.00/11.00 p.m. on bank of canal the 
crime had immediately been reported to the police because 
prosecution claimed it a road having nearby urban area for ply of 
traffic round the clock. In support of his arguments learned counsel 
for the appellant has read the following portion of cross examination 
on Fazal Ahmad Sarra Inspector, PW-20 (third investigator); 
“It is correct that complainant Aslam while appearing before me 
stated that “where dead bodies of our kids were lying and blood was 
also oozed there; one sandal of deceased Hamid was not there; 
mobile phone of Zain-ul-Hassan was not there; there was no scratch 
of wound due to falling from motor bike; there was also no 
scratch/wound for falling on the ground; the motor bike was in fine 
condition and it seemed that the same was laid down intentionally; 
the crime empties were lying under the dead body which connoted 
that the deceased persons were murdered somewhere else and their 
dead bodies were shifted there later on; because an alone person 
cannot make firing solely while driving motorbike.” 
Further deposed; 
It is correct that PW Luqman stated before me that the averments 
made by the complainant before me are true. It is correct that PW 
Luqman stated before me that “deceased Zain, Rabi and Hamid 
were murdered somewhere else but their dead bodies were shifted 
at the alleged place of occurrence later on” 
 
The above reference shows that laymen like complainant and 
witnesses after viewing the condition of dead bodies and articles lying 
near them, did observe that it was not the place of murder, then it was 
not expected that investigating officer being expert witness had 
oversighted such fact. The best course, in the situation was lifting of 
finger prints from the mobile, shoes of deceased and spent shells so as 
to rule out any interference with the articles, but failing in such 
exercise police has further made place of murder as doubtful. From 
the above reference of the statement of PW-20 and observations made 
by this Court herein and in preceding paragraphs, it is apparent that 
prosecution has even failed to prove the actual place of murder, which 
has never been pointed out by the accused/appellant. 
 
13. 
 Prosecution in this case though has made an effort to procure 
evidence in the form of polygraph test but surprisingly expert did not 
conduct it due to the reason that accused/appellant allegedly confessed 

11 
Crl. Appeal No. 77969-J of 2019 &  
Crl. Revision No. 62123 of 2019. 
 
his guilt before him. It was claimed that confession was recorded by 
him separately. Expert was not a magistrate so as to give words to the 
alleged confession rather was under duty to conduct polygraph test 
even in that situation in order to ascertain the truth of such confession. 
This Court through case reported as “MUHAMMAD ASLAM Versus THE 
STATE and others” (PLJ 2023 Cr. C Lahore 765) has regarded the 
polygraph test an effective tool to provide evidence of facts coming 
from the mouth of an accused. Refusal by expert to conduct the 
polygraph test created further doubt that prosecution was not serious 
to collect impartial evidence rather was motivated to book the 
offender at every cost. If the confession before the expert is 
considered as informal admission (commonly known as extra judicial 
confession), then such confession should have been tendered in 
evidence with appearance of expert in the dock, but it has not been 
done.  
  
14. 
 Allegedly no motive was asserted in this case by the 
prosecution but during investigation a suspicion erupted that sister of 
accused/appellant was in touch with one of the deceased as a friend 
which infuriated the accused/appellant to commit the murders but no 
such link was found because said sister of accused/appellant though 
implicated as an accused but was exonerated during investigation and 
trial Court did not opt to summon her. Thus, on this limb prosecution 
has no case. 
 
15. 
 Medical evidence in this case does not advance the case of 
prosecution because nobody had seen the occurrence, therefore, 
locale, dimension and nature of injuries cannot be read as supportive 
to any fact alleged by the witnesses of circumstantial evidence. 
However, as observed in preceding paragraphs, nature of fires and 
injuries do not depict that deceased persons received the same while 
riding on motorcycle. Similarly, no blackening or burning was 
observed around the wounds of deceased persons and being distant 
fires do not provide any opportunity to any of the deceased to catch 
the hair of accused/appellant as alleged its presence in the clenched 
palm of Rabbi Umais deceased. Doctor has also conceded, while 
noting the different sizes of injuries on the person of deceased, that 

12 
Crl. Appeal No. 77969-J of 2019 &  
Crl. Revision No. 62123 of 2019. 
 
different weapons have been used in commission of murders, which is 
against the prosecution‟s case theory.    
 
16. 
 
Recovery of pistol on the lead of accused/appellant from 
the house of his uncle Shabbir Ahmad on 28.09.2016 was mere a fake 
formality because from the same house on 18.09.2016 accused/ 
appellant had allegedly got recovered his right shoe/Sandal (P-15), 
and motor cycle (P-14) used by him in the occurrence and it is not 
expected that police had not conducted a thorough search of said 
house so as to collect any other incriminating material, particularly 
when pistol had yet not been recovered.  Thus, recovery was 
apparently planted upon the accused/appellant. Even otherwise when 
there is no direct evidence in this case and other circumstantial 
evidence has also been disbelieved, mere on the basis of recovery 
conviction cannot be recorded nor sustained.   
17.    Prosecution has also produced in evidence some CDR of phone 
numbers but PW-17 conceded that no SIM number was in the name of 
accused/appellant. Although phone of Rabbi Umais was found present 
near the dead bodies but it was claimed that cell No. 0334 7941801 
recovered from the accused/ appellant at the time of his arrest was 
found issued in the name of Rabbi Umais. It was alleged that such 
number was in the possession of Sunaina, sister of accused/appellant 
which shows her link with the deceased. No chat or voice messages 
were available in support thereof, that was the reason said Sunaina 
was not summoned by the Court as an accused nor prosecution was 
able to establish the fact of her link with any of the deceased. Further, 
PW-16 Yasir Abbas 579-C who collected such CDR concedes that 
detail of owner of cell No. 334-7941801 is not given in CDR. He 
further concedes that CDR was obtained from IT office, DPO Sialkot 
through email. Neither CDR was obtained from concerned mobile 
company nor any representative of such company appeared in the 
dock. Thus, such CDR was not admissible in evidence.   
18.    After evaluating the evidence in this case, it is apparent that this 
case is a worst form of tunnel vision on the part of police and 
prosecution. In an article, on “Tunnel vision” inspired by a book

Crl. Revision No. 62123 of 2019. 
 
written by Brian L. Cutler (Ed.), Conviction of the innocent: Lessons 
from psychological research (pp. 303–323). American Psychological 
Association, Findley, K. A. (2012) refers it as under; 
Tunnel vision is a natural human tendency that has particularly 
pernicious effects in the criminal justice system. This process leads 
investigators, prosecutors, judges, and defense lawyers alike to focus 
on a particular conclusion and then filter all evidence in a case 
through the lens provided by that conclusion. Through that filter, all 
information that supports the adopted conclusion is elevated in 
significance, viewed as consistent with the other evidence, and 
deemed relevant and probative. Evidence inconsistent with the chosen 
theory is easily overlooked or dismissed as irrelevant, incredible, or 
unreliable. Properly understood, tunnel vision is more often the 
product of the human condition, as well as institutional and cultural 
pressures, than of maliciousness or indifference. 
 
19.   Public Prosecution Service of Cananda in its publications explain 
that tunnel vision in the criminal justice context can be described as a 
tendency of participants in the system, such as police or prosecutors, 
to focus on a particular theory of a case and to dismiss or undervalue 
evidence which contradicts that theory. This mental process leads to 
“…unconscious filtering in of evidence that will „build a case‟ against 
a particular suspect, while ignoring or suppressing evidence 
respecting the same suspect that tends to point away from guilt.”  
 
          Legal scholars typically include “confirmation bias” as an 
element of tunnel vision. Confirmation bias is a powerful 
psychological process that causes an individual to unconsciously 
prefer information that supports a conclusion that they have already 
settled on and to disregard or be overly sceptical about information 
that contradicts that conclusion. While tunnel vision narrows the focus 
of an investigation to a single target, confirmation bias leads 
investigators and prosecutors to filter in evidence supporting their 
theory and to ignore or undervalue evidence that suggests their theory 
might be incorrect. Confirmation bias causes people to seek, recall, 
and even interpret data in ways that support their prior beliefs. 
  
          “Hindsight bias,” or the “knew-it-all-along effect,” is another 
psychological phenomenon that affects tunnel vision in criminal 
investigations and prosecutions. Hindsight bias occurs when a person 
mixes new information with old information in their brain. This can

Crl. Revision No. 62123 of 2019. 
 
result in a person believing an event was predictable and they knew it 
would happen, even if there was no objective evidence for predicting 
it would occur at the time. The danger of this process in the course of 
an investigation or prosecution is that when a theory of a case is 
developed, hindsight bias can lead to a “rejudgment” process that the 
given outcome seems inevitable or, at least, more plausible than 
alternative outcomes.” Studies have shown that hindsight bias can also 
affect judgements about accused persons‟ past conduct, making the 
current allegations against them seem all the more probable.   
 
          In addition to unconscious biases, human psychology also tells 
us that individuals typically rely on a host of cognitive heuristics or 
mental shortcuts to make decisions, even complex ones. Decision 
makers - even the best, the brightest and the highly principled - do not 
have unlimited mental capacity to process each piece of information 
that is presented to them in a problem, assign the level of importance 
each piece has on the decision as a whole, consider all the available 
alternatives, and then engage in a complex mental algorithm to arrive 
at their decision. Indeed, research suggests that as the demands on 
limited cognitive resources increase, the more likely it is that 
decision-makers will employ cognitive heuristics or other strategies 
intended to reduce the amount of mental effort required to arrive at a 
decision. In such cases, the decision-maker is often (unconsciously) 
seeking a satisfactory solution, rather than an optimal one. An 
exploratory piece of research conducted by Islam, Weir and Del Fiol 
(2014), examined decision making in expert clinicians and found they 
use mental shortcuts in complex cases, particularly when they are 
faced with significant time constraints, multiple interruptions and 
simultaneous demands. 
 
       It is a collection of mental processes that occur in all human 
beings and, as such, cannot be prevented merely through education on 
the topic and/or an effort among justice system participants to attempt 
to consciously avoid tunnel vision through ordinary practices. 
 
20. 
 
For what has been discussed above, I have no doubt to 
hold that here in this case the prosecution has miserably failed to 

15 
Crl. Appeal No. 77969-J of 2019 &  
Crl. Revision No. 62123 of 2019. 
 
establish the charge against the accused/appellant beyond any shadow 
of doubt. In the case of “Mst. HAJIRA BIBI alias SEEMA and others 
versus ABDUL QASEEM and another” (2023 SCMR 870), the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan has held that for giving benefit of doubt to 
an accused a single circumstance creating reasonable doubt in a 
prudent mind about guilt of accused is sufficient to make him entitled 
to such benefit, but here in this case multiple doubts have marred the 
prosecution case in its entirety. Thus, prosecution has squarely failed 
to bring home the guilt against the accused/appellant. Consequently, 
Crl. Appeal No. 77969-J of 2019 is allowed, impugned judgment of 
conviction & sentence is set-aide and the accused/appellant is 
acquitted of the charges against him. He shall be released forthwith if 
not required in any other case. The case property, if any, be disposed 
of in accordance with law and record of the learned trial Court be sent 
back immediately.  
21. 
For the above reasons, Crl. Revision No.62123 of 2019, filed 
by the complainant, is dismissed.
