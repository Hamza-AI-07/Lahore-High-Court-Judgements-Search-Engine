JUDGMENT 
 
 
Date of hearing 
27.4.2023 
For the Petitioner: 
Muhammad 
Aqeel 
Wahid 
Chaudhry, 
Advocate. 
For the Respondents: 
Mr Sittar Sahil, Assistant Advocate General, 
with Dr Qadeer Alam, Additional Inspector 
General (Judicial). 
 
“Justice does not stop at the prison gate.” 
 
 
 
Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – The Petitioner’s son, Naveed 
Ahmed, was arrested in case FIR No.913/2014 dated 25.11.2014 
registered at Police Station Jhang Bazar, Faisalabad, for offences under 
section 365-A of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1908, and section 7(e) of the 
Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. The trial court found him guilty and 
sentenced him to death on two counts. However, this Court altered his 
sentence from death to life imprisonment on both charges. He has filed 
Crl. P.L.A. No.308/L/2020 against his conviction and sentence before 
the Supreme Court of Pakistan, which is pending. 
2. 
 
Naveed Ahmed was serving his sentence in the Central Jail 
Faisalabad, but Respondent No.3 (Superintendent, Central Jail 
Faisalabad) has lately shifted him to the Adiala Jail Rawalpindi. The 
Petitioner filed an application before Respondent No.3 requesting him to 
recall his order stating that she is an elderly, ailing and impoverished 
woman, hence cannot visit her son at Adiala Jail, which is a long

distance away. Respondent No.3 did not attend to her request whereupon 
she approached Respondent No.2 (Inspector General of Police (Prisons), 
Punjab) without fruition. The Petitioner now seeks the intervention of 
this Court under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic 
of Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”). 
3. 
 
Respondent No.3 has submitted his report stating that 
Naveed Ahmed is a desperate and hardened criminal. On 12.1.2015, he 
was admitted to the Central Jail Faisalabad as an under-trial prisoner in 
case FIR No. 913/2014. Following the decision of the case by the Anti-
Terrorism Court, he was moved to the District Jail, Toba Tek Singh, by 
order of the Home Department, Government of the Punjab. 
Subsequently, he was transferred to the Central Jail Mianwali. On 
16.10.2019, he was re-admitted in the Central Jail Faisalabad on the 
directives of the Deputy Inspector General of Prisons, Sargodha Region. 
According to Respondent No.3, Naveed Ahmed committed eight jail 
offences and is a serious problem for the authorities. On 16.11.2021, the 
Deputy Inspector General of Prisons, Faisalabad Region, sent him to 
Adiala Jail Rawalpindi for administrative reasons. 
4. 
 
The Assistant Advocate General, on instructions, states that 
neither the Petitioner nor Naveed Ahmed made any representation before 
Respondent No.2 against the DIG’s action.  
Prisoners’ rights 
5. 
 
International law, as well as State laws, recognize that 
prisoners, both civil and military, have rights. International instruments 
include 
(i) 
the 
European 
Convention 
on 
Human 
Rights;  
(ii) the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; (iii) the 
United Nations Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (Nelson 
Mandela Rules); (iv) the European Convention for the Prevention of 
Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; (v) the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; (vi) the United 
Nations Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and Non-custodial 
Measures for Women Offenders (the Bangkok Rules). The Third Geneva 
Convention defines humanitarian protections for prisoners of war.

Besides, recommendations and guidelines for dealing with 
prisoners are also found in the following: (a) the Body of Principles for 
the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or 
Imprisonment; (b) the European Prison Rules. 
7. 
 
The Constitution of Pakistan safeguards prisoners’ rights by 
Articles 4, 10, 10A and 14. The Prisons Act 1894 and the Prisoners Act 
1900 are two key enactments governing prisoners’ affairs and 
management. These Acts were enacted during the British Rule in India, 
which Pakistan adopted after the partition. These are now supplemented 
by the Rules and Orders of the Lahore High Court, Lahore Volume II, 
Chapter 27 (Judicial and Police Lock-ups), and Pakistan Prison Rules, 
19781 (hereinafter referred to as the “Prison Rules”). 
8. 
 
According to international human rights law and 
contemporary perspectives on crimes and punishment, the prison system 
must balance the rights of the prisoners, victims of crime and society. 
Lord Woolf noted in his report on the riots in English prisons in 1990 
that maintaining the perfect balance between security, control, and 
justice is the key to an effectively managed prison. To this end, the law 
empowers the jail authorities to take appropriate measures to maintain 
discipline in prison. However, Rule 36 of Nelson Mandela Rules 
emphasizes that “discipline and order shall be maintained with no more 
restriction than is necessary to ensure safe custody, the secure operation 
of the prison and a well-ordered community life.” Rule 39 stipulates that 
no prisoner shall be sanctioned except in accordance with the terms of 
law, principles of fairness and due process. The Rule further 
contemplates proportionality between a disciplinary sanction and jail 
offence and prohibits inflicting punishment twice for the same offence.  
Principle 30 of the United Nations’ Body of Principles for the Protection 
of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment 
establishes a prisoner’s right to be heard by the authorities before 
imposing disciplinary action. Rule 23 of the Bangkok Rules restricts 
prison authorities from imposing disciplinary sanctions on women 
prisoners, which create hardships for their families and legal counsel. 
                                          
1 These Rules have been framed under section 59 of the Prisons Act, 1894, and are referred to as the 
Jail Manual.

Rule 4 of the Prison Rules 1978 classifies the prisons into 
four categories, namely, Central Prisons, Special Prisons, District 
Prisons and Sub-Jails. Rule 224 states that the prisoners are of the 
following types: 
i) 
a criminal prisoner, which includes (a) a convicted prisoner, 
and (b) an unconvicted or under-trial prisoner; 
ii) 
a civil prisoner; 
iii) 
a State prisoner detained under Regulation III of 1818, or a 
person ordered to be detained in prison without trial under any 
law relating to the detention of such person. 
 
 
Rule 224 also provides that lunatics may be temporarily 
detained in prisons under the orders of the Magistrate. Rules 225 to 249 
specify additional classification and segregation of prisoners. Sections 
29, 37, and 39 of the Prisoners Act 1900 govern prisoner transfers within 
the province, while section 40 outside it. 
10. 
 
Section 29 of the Prisoners Act 1900 deals with the transfer 
of prisoners from one jail to another. It states– 
29. 
Removal of prisoners.– (1) The 
Provincial 
Government 
may, by general or special order, provide for the removal of any 
prisoner confined in a prison– 
(a) 
under sentence of death, or 
(b) 
under, or in lieu of, a sentence of imprisonment or 
transportation, or 
(c) 
in default of payment of a fine, 
(d) 
in default of giving security for keeping the peace or 
for maintaining good behaviour, 
(e) 
unconvicted criminal prisoners, 
to any other prison in the province, or, with the consent of the 
Provincial Government concerned, to any prison in the other 
Province, or, with the consent of the Central Government to any 
prison maintained by it or under its authority in any part of Pakistan. 
(2) 
Subject to the orders, and under the control of the Provincial 
Government the Director of Prisons may, in the like manner, provide 
for the removal of any prisoner confined as aforesaid in a prison 
situate in the area for which he is appointed to any of the prison in 
such area. 
(3) 
The Central Government may, by general or special order, 
provide for the removal of any prisoner or class of prisoners confined 
in any prison to any other prison in Pakistan maintained by or under 
the authority of the Central Government or of a Provincial 
Government with the consent of the Provincial Government 
concerned. 
11. 
 
The original section 29 of the Prisoners Act 1900 was silent 
about the transfer of under-trial prisoners either within or outside the 

Writ Petition No. 24030/2022 
 
- 5 - 
province. Clause (e) was inserted in it by Notification No. Prs. I (M) 
1572, dated 6th July 1977. In Muhammad Tufail Khokhar v. The 
Inspector-General of Prisons, Punjab, and others (PLD 1980 Lahore 
162), this Court noted that the Governor had issued the said notification 
purportedly in the exercise of the powers under section 60 of the Act, 
which had already been repealed by the Government of India 
(Adaptation of Indian Laws) Order, 1937. Therefore, it held that it was 
null and void. A Division Bench of this Court endorsed this view in  
Asif Kamal v. The Judge Accountability Court, Multan, and others 
(2020 PCr.LJ 1), and added: 
“… in the absence of any legal provision, either expressly placing a 
bar or allowing the Government to transfer, the custody of a duly 
committed under-trial prisoner, subject to the permission of the 
concerned court, from one prison to another, the Government may 
transfer, such a prisoner without causing prejudice to his admissible 
rights and privileges including his right to a fair trial. An under-trial 
prisoner may also seek his transfer upon showing his grievance 
regarding the breach of his admissible rights and privileges for 
fulfillment thereof by way of his confinement in a particular prison. 
The court, after giving a proper hearing to all the concerned, being 
under a legal obligation to consider all relevant, legal, factual 
necessities and situational demands with their possible consequences 
while keeping in view that the under-trial prisoner enjoys an inherent 
presumption of innocence till found guilty, shall pass such order of 
transfer of unconvicted prisoner. Needless to observe that such an 
order of the court is bound to affect either way, the right to life, not 
only of the individual prisoner but also some of his related persons. 
Therefore, the order of transfer of custody from one prison to another 
is a judicial order and not a ministerial one.” 
12. 
 
It is important to note that section 29 of the Prisoners Act 
1900 confers the power to transfer prisoners on three authorities, viz, the 
Provincial Government, the Director of Prisons (who exercises his 
powers subject to the orders and control of the Provincial Government 
within the area falling in his jurisdiction), and the Federal Government. 
In Muhammad Tufail Khokhar, supra, the Court also pointed out that the 
Inspector General of Prisons does not figure in that section. The relevant 
excerpt is reproduced below: 
“Again, there is no power vesting with the Inspector-General of 
Prisons under section 29 of the Prisoners Act to transfer any 
unconvicted prisoner from one prison to the other, as even the above 
said notification of the Governor, issued under a non-existent 
provision of law, conferred that power only on the Provincial 
Government.”

Interestingly, neither the Prisons Act 1894, nor the Prisons 
Act 1900 mention the post of the Inspector General of Prisons in the 
Punjab. Chapter II of the 1894 Act contains provisions for appointing 
other officers of prisons except the Inspector General. Section 5 thereof 
stipulates that the Provincial Government shall appoint Directors of 
Prisons for designated areas, who shall exercise general control and 
superintendence of prisons in their respective areas, and the staff 
employed therein, subject to the Provincial Government’s orders.2 
Section 6 states that every prison must have a Superintendent, a Medical 
Officer (who may also be the Superintendent), a Medical Subordinate, a 
Jailer and other officers as the Provincial Government thinks necessary.3 
The situation mentioned above has arisen because of a lapse on the part 
of the legislature. A peep through history reveals that the original 1894 
Act envisioned “Director of Prisons” for specified regions, defining the 
term in section 3(7) read with section 5. West Pakistan (Adaptation and 
Repeal of Laws) Act, 1957 (W.P. Act XVI of 1957) substituted 
“Director of Prisons” with “Inspector General of Prisons”. The Prisons 
(West Pakistan Amendment) Act 1958 (XLI of 1958) inserted clause  
(7A) in section 3 of the 1894 Act to introduce the office of the Deputy 
Inspector General of Prisons. However, West Pakistan (Adaptation of 
Laws) Ordinance, 1962 (XXV of 1962) deleted clauses (7) and (7A) of 
section 3 and replaced both these posts with Director of Prisons. As of 
today, these clauses do not exist in the Statute Book in the Punjab 
though section 5, which talks of the Directors of Prisons, is there. Sindh 
and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have been vigilant. Sind Ordinance No.1 of 
19784 amended the Acts of 1894 and 1900, substituting “Director” 
                                          
2 For facility of reference, section 5 of the Prisons Act 1894 is reproduced below: 
5. Directors of Prisons.— Directors of Prisons shall be appointed for the areas to be 
defined by the Provincial Government, and shall exercise, subject to the orders of the 
Provincial Government, the general control and superintendence of prisons and the staff 
employed in the prisons in the respective areas for which they are appointed. 
3 The proviso to section 6 reads: 
Provided further that in the Punjab the Provincial Government may appoint for any prison a 
Deputy Superintendent instead of a Jailer, and an Assistant Superintendent instead of a 
Deputy or Assistant Jailer, and these officers when so appointed shall exercise the same 
powers, shall discharge the same duties, and shall be subject to the same disabilities as Jailers 
and Deputy or Assistant Jailers respectively.

wherever occurring with “Inspector General”.5 The North-West Frontier 
Province Adaptation of Prisons Laws Act, 1977 (NWFP Act No.VI of 
1977) made similar amendments to the two statutes.6 A closer 
examination of these enactments reflects that the terms “Director of 
Prisons” 
and 
“Inspector 
General 
Prisons” 
have 
been 
used 
interchangeably throughout history. Therefore, the Punjab legislature’s 
failure to make appropriate revisions to the Acts of 1894 and 1900, 
particularly section 5 of the former, has no legal ramifications. The 
“Director of Prisons” in section 5, ibid., must be read as “Inspector 
General Prisons”. Chapter 36 of the Prison Rules reinforces my point of 
view. It is captioned “Inspector General”, and the sub-heading reads: 
“Appointment and Powers of Inspector General under section 5, Act IX, 
1894.”  Nonetheless, it is recommended that the Chief Secretary Punjab 
and the Secretaries of the Home Department and the Ministry of Law 
take immediate steps to remove the anomalies. 
14. 
 
Chapter 36 of the Prison Rules defines the duties and 
powers of the Inspector General and the Deputy Inspector General of 
Prisons. Chapter 7 deals with the issue of prisoner transfers. 
15. 
 
Everyday injustice in jails fuels a sense of injustice: 
inconsistent processes, arbitrary decisions, bureaucratic delays, ignored 
complaints, poor living conditions and the lack of privacy due to a 
shared cell. Unfair or unjust treatment breeds resentment, anger and 
violence, creating a cycle of conflict and harm.7 Nevertheless, 
transferring a prison from one jail to another is sometimes necessary for 
                                          
5 The Sindh Prisons & Correction Service Act 2019 (and the Sindh Prisons and Corrections Service 
Rules 2019) now provides for the regulation, control and management of prisons. 
6 Sections 2 & 3 of NWFP Act No.VI of 1977 are reproduced below for ready reference: 
2. 
Amendment of the Prisons Act, 1894. – In the Prisons Act, 1894 (IX of 1894).—
(a) 
and in all rules, orders or notifications made or issued under the said Act, for the 
expression “Director of Prisons”, wherever occurring, the expression “Inspector General of 
Prisons” shall be substituted; and 
(b) 
for 
section 
5, 
the 
following 
section 
shall 
be 
substituted. 
namely:— 
“5. Inspector General of Prisons. — An Inspector Genera! of Prisons shall be appointed by 
the Provincial Government and shall exercise, subject to the orders of the Provincial 
Government, the general control and superintendence of prisons and the staff employed in 
the prisons.” 
3. 
Amendment of Prisoners Act, 1900. – In the Prisoners Act, 1900 (III of 1900), and 
in all rules, orders or notifications made or issued thereunder, for the expression “Director of 
Prisons”, wherever occurring, the expression “Inspector General of Prisons” shall be 
substituted.

administrative or security reasons. Using this power arbitrarily can cause 
injustice and immense hardship for the prisoner and his family. In Re: 
Human Rights Cases by Syed A. Tajwar, Lawyer, Ansar Burney 
Welfare Trust and another (1994 SCMR 1527), the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan directed the authorities of all the four provinces to follow a 
uniform policy, as far as practicable, to keep the prisoners closer to their 
home districts. It held that doing so would not only be in keeping with 
the spirit of the Prison Rules but would also help alleviate a human 
problem.  
16. 
 
Although Chapter 7 of the Prison Rules contains provisions 
to prevent abuse of the power to transfer prisoners, in Dr Muhammad 
Aslam Khakhi and others v. The State and others (PLD 2010 FSC 1), 
the Federal Shariat Court stressed the need to structure it and make the 
entire process more transparent and fair. The Court stated that Islam 
forbids the arbitrary exercise of authority. It said:  
“Direction by the Government or the Inspector General of Prison 
Department for removal of a prisoner from one prison to another 
prison within the Province or from one Province to another Province 
must be supported by a speaking order. Unless it is a question of dire 
necessity or emergency, a notice of transfer must be given to the 
prisoner. It is the right of a prisoner to know why he is being 
transferred away from his home town. There must be legal 
justification to lodge a prisoner far away from the place of his 
residence. Such a transfer has, in many cases, worked to serious 
disadvantage, particularly of women folk and children, of prisoner.” 
17. 
 
In Aslam Khaki’s case, the Federal Shariat Court ruled that 
Rules 147 through 149 of the Pakistan Prisons Rules, 1978, as well as 
section 29 of the Prisoners Act, are repugnant to the Islamic Injunctions 
insofar as the Government has unfettered power to transfer a prisoner 
from one province to another province without giving notice to the 
prisoner or without obtaining his consent or without referring to any 
lawful reason by way of a speaking order conveyed to the detenue and 
without providing any remedy against exercise of such authority. The 
Federal Shariat Court declared that the power of the Inspector General of 
Prisons to transfer a prisoner from one prison to another within the 
province without notice to the prisoner or obtaining his consent and 
without providing a right of appeal before an independent tribunal is 
similarly repugnant to the Islamic Injunctions. Section 29 of Prisoners 

Writ Petition No. 24030/2022

Act, 1900 and Chapter 7 of the Prison Rules should be recast so that  
(a) arbitrary, unbridled and unfettered powers are neither given to the 
Government nor the Inspector General of Prisons; (b) transfers within or 
beyond the province, without notice or consent, should be avoided 
unless the gravity of the situation truly demands it. This does not apply 
to a convict whose release date is approaching, and he is being relocated 
near his home town following Rule 148, or who is required to be 
produced in another court in a case being tried elsewhere, or if there are 
other legitimate grounds such as safety, security or health. 
18. 
 
Legislative reforms and a comprehensive policy on prisoner 
transfer based on the guiding principles outlined in the international 
instruments referred to in the earlier part of this judgment and the Aslam 
Khaki case are long overdue. On 24.11.2022, this Court directed the 
Punjab Government to take immediate measures in this regard. Dr 
Qadeer Alam, AIG (Judicial), has apprised that the requisite reforms are 
on the anvil and will be notified shortly. All future transfers would be 
made according to it. He prays that this petition may be converted into a 
representation and referred to the Home Department for reconsideration. 
The Petitioner’s counsel has no objection to this course.  
19. 
 
The Punjab Government is directed to ensure that there is 
no more delay in the much-need legislative reforms. Insofar as this 
petition is concerned, the matter is referred to the Home Department for 
reconsideration, as both sides have requested.
