Mr. Salman Zaheer Khan, learned Advocate for the 
applicant. 
Barrister Muhammad Saram Israr, learned Advocate 
for respondents No. 2 to 4.  
        Sultan Tanvir Ahmad, J:-Through this 
reference-application filed under section 133(1) of 
the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (the ‘Ordinance’) 
the applicant has requested to answer the following 
questions arising out of order dated 09.11.2017 
passed by the learned Appellate Tribunal Inland 
Revenue, Lahore (the “Tribunal”):- 
 
“A. 
Whether 
the 
Appellate 
Tribunal has erred in law to hold 
that in terms of Section 2(47) of 
the Sales Tax Act, 1990 (the "ST 
Act") read with Rule 4 Chapter 1 
of the Sales Tax Rules 2006 (the 
"ST Rules") a person could only 
be treated as wholesaler if he has 
been authorized to act as an agent 
for sale? 
B. Whether, based on the facts 
and circumstances of the case, the 
Appellate Tribunal has erred in 

                                                        I.T.R. No. 112167-2017 
 
 
2 
 
law to hold that unregistered 
persons/buyers under the ST Act 
must be treated as retailers and 
cannot 
be 
treated 
as 
wholesalers?” 
 
2.  
Mr. Salman Zaheer Khan, learned 
counsel for the applicant has submitted that the 
definition of the term "wholesaler" in section 2(47) 
of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 (the ‘Act’) shows that the 
respondent-department reached to an incorrect 
conclusion by reading only portion of the definition 
that suits the 
respondents' viewpoint, while 
deliberately ignoring the earlier part of the same 
definition; that the recipients to whom the applicant 
sold sugar squarely fall within the definition of 
“wholesaler”. It is further submitted that the 
definition of "wholesaler" is intended to be a non-
exhaustive and inclusive definition, with each 
portion of the said definition being separate, distinct 
and disjunctive. He has added that it has been 
ignored that at the relevant time i.e. fiscal year 2014-
2015 Rule 4 of Chapter I of the Sales Tax Rules 
2006 (the ‘Rules’) provided a separate definition of 
“retailer” for the purposes of registration and de-
registration, therefore, non-registration could not 

                                                        I.T.R. No. 112167-2017

automatically convert a person, involved in bulk sale 
and purchase, within the definition of “retailer”.  
3.  
Barrister 
Muhammad 
Saram 
Israr, 
learned advocate for respondents No. 2 to 4 
controverted the stance of the applicant and the 
interpretation of above provisions made by the 
learned counsel of the applicant.

Heard. 
5.  
The applicant, was served with show-
cause-notice dated 01.12.2015 (the ‘notice’) on the 
basis of the then newly inserted sections i.e. 236G 
and 236H of the Ordinance through Finance Act 
2013 being a manufacturer of sugar on account of 
failure to collect tax on sales made to wholesalers / 
retailers at the rate specified therein. The notice 
culminated into order dated 28.12.2015 (the ‘order-
in-original’) passed by respondent No. 3, whereby, 
while relying upon section 2(47) of the Act and rule 
4 of the Rules, the said respondent has reached to the 
conclusion that sales made to unregistered persons 
are to be treated as supply to retailer and this 
required collection of tax under section 236H of the 
Ordinance @ 0.5% of the gross amount of sales. The 

                                                        I.T.R. No. 112167-2017

appeal to the learned Tribunal was filed, which was 
decided on 09.11.2017 almost with the same 
conclusion. 
6.  
Both sides, in course of arguments, 
focused on the definition clauses of the Act in the 
relevant fiscal year that reads as under:- 
2(47) "wholesaler" includes a dealer 
and means any person who carries on, 
whether regularly or otherwise, the 
business of buying and selling goods by 
wholesale 
or 
of 
supplying 
or 
distributing goods, directly or indirectly, 
by wholesale for cash or deferred 
payment or for commission or other 
valuable consideration or stores such 
goods belonging to others as an agent 
for the purpose of sale; and includes a 
person supplying taxable goods to a 
person who deducts income tax at 
source under the Income Tax Ordinance, 
2001 (XLIX of 2001); and 
2(28) 
"retailer" 
means 
a 
person 
supplying goods to general public for 
the purpose of consumption. 
Provided that any person, who combines 
the business of import and retail or 
manufacture or production with retail, 
shall notify and advertise wholesale 
prices and retail prices separately, and 
declare the address of retail outlets.

7.  
Various recipients (the ‘recipients’) of 
supplies of the applicant, are treated as “retailer” on 
account of failure to register as “wholesaler”. The 

                                                        I.T.R. No. 112167-2017

requirement to register as “wholesaler” or “retailer” 
depending upon their particular activity was 
separately given in Chapter I of the Rules. We would 
like to reproduce the relevant rule applicable during 
the material time period:- 
"4. Requirement of registration. The 
following persons engaged in making of 
taxable supplies in Pakistan including 
zero-rated supplies in the course or 
furtherance of any table activity carried 
on by them, if not already registered, are 
required to be registered in the manner 
specified in this chapter, namely:-  
(a) xxx 
 
          (b)  a retailer whose value of 
supplies, in any period during 
the last twelve months exceeds 
five million rupees:  
 
         (c) xxx 
 
        (d)  a 
wholesaler 
(including 
dealer) and distributor 
 
        (e)   xxx 
 
        (f)   xxx 
8.  
The learned two forums below relied on 
the above provisions while reaching to the 
conclusion that the recipients are to be considered as 
“retailers” and applicant was required to collect 
0.5% tax under section 236H of the Ordinance. This 
Court in case titled “Olympia Industries (Pvt.) Ltd., 
Lahore versus Assistant Collector, Central Excise & 
Sales Tax, Sheikhupura Division, Lahore and 2 
others” (2002 PTD 776) while interpreting word 

                                                        I.T.R. No. 112167-2017

“wholesale” reached to the conclusion that the same 
has specific commercial meaning of buying goods 
and selling them in large quantities to traders who 
then sell the goods in smaller quantities. Even 
otherwise, a plain reading of above reproduced 
provisions of law reflects that legislature envisaged 
“wholesalers” and “retailers” as two distinct persons 
depending on their characteristics of business and 
quantity of the commodities they deal with as well 
as the category of the recipients of such supplies. 
“Retailer” as per the then section 2(28) of the Act 
was a person supplying goods to general public for 
consumption purposes or end-consumers. The 
proviso to the same further clarified the position 
even if someone combines the business of retail with 
some other nature of business. 
9.  
The consequences, if any person fails to 
register himself as “wholesaler” or “retailer”, as the 
case may be, were given in the Ordinance at the 
relevant time, which are also ignored by the 
assessing officer. Supplies to a person having 
“wholesaler” status when failed to register had result 
of collection at higher rate of 0.2% as provided in 
Division XIV, Pt. IV of Schedule I of the Ordinance. 

                                                        I.T.R. No. 112167-2017

Treating a person as “retailer” merely on account of 
non-registration as “wholesaler”, without first 
assuming an exercise of ascertaining his actual status 
is unsafe. The questions reproduced above are, 
therefore, answered in affirmative and in favour of 
the applicant. 
10.  
At this juncture, learned counsel for 
revenue has stated that the case may be remanded to 
assessing officer to ascertain the actual position or 
status of the recipients. This is not objected by 
learned counsel for the applicant. The orders assailed 
before us are, therefore, set-aside and the case is 
remanded to the assessing officer in terms of the 
above developed consensus. A copy of this order be 
sent to the learned Tribunal as required under 
section 133(8) of the Ordinance.
