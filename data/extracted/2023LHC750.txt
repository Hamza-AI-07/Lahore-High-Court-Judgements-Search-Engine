Mr. Muhammad Zain Qazi, Assistant 
Attorney General on Court’s call.  
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.- This  
consolidated judgment shall decide instant appeal, along with 
following connected appeals, as common questions of law and facts 
are involved in these cases:- 
1. RFA No.10237 of 2023 titled Silver Star Insurance Company Limited, 
Lahore v. M/s Yaqoob Industries, Lahore & another. 
 
2. RFA No.10255 of 2023 titled Silver Star Insurance Company Limited,

3.  RFA No.10262 of 2023 titled Silver Star Insurance Company Limited, 
Lahore v. Hamza Industries, Lahore & others. 
2. 
Through instant appeal, appellant has called into question 
judgment dated 23.12.2022, passed by learned Insurance Tribunal, 
Lahore, whereby insurance petition, filed by respondent No.1, was 
allowed and the claim was partly decreed to the extent of remaining 
amount of Rs.13,038,867/- along with the liquidated damages from 
the date of filing of the claim till the realization of the amount. 
3. 
Learned counsel for appellants submits that without deciding 
appellants’ applications for impleading Pakistan Re Insurance

Company Limited and seeking amendment in the written reply, 
impugned judgment is not sustainable in the eye of law.  
 
Learned counsel for appellants, at the very outset, was 
confronted with Para 8 of the impugned judgment, whereby 
insurance petition was decided on the basis of certain admissions 
made by the appellants, which reads as under:- 
 
“8. 
Since the claim of the petitioner is admitted by the 
respondent No.1, partial payment of the claim has already been 
made by the respondent No.1 and categorically stated that the 
remaining amount would be paid as and when the funds would be 
available with the respondent No.1, therefore, the petitioner is 
entitled for the relief claimed in the prayer.”  
It is also noted by learned Insurance Tribunal that appellant in its 
written reply to the insurance petition unconditionally acceded the 
claim of respondent No.1, specifically mentioning the amounts paid 
and willingness to pay the remaining amount in installments as 
allegedly appellant was facing financial hardships.  
 
In response, learned counsel for appellants could not rebut 
the above facts.  
4. 
 Heard. 
5.  
Undeniably, appellants freely and explicitly acknowledged 
the claim of respondent No.1, payment of partial claim to 
respondent and also showed readiness to settle the outstanding 
amount, which is tantamount to admission of its liability 
regarding the decretal amount. Needless to say that an admission 
/ statement / undertaking, by a party, during the judicial 
proceedings has to be given sanctity while applying the principle 
of legal estoppel and estoppel by conduct as well as to respect 
moral and ethical rules.  Hence, at any subsequent stage, a party 
cannot turn around to wriggle out from the consequence of such 
admission. If disclaimer therefrom is allowed as a matter of right, 
then it will definitely result into distrust of the public litigants

over the judicial proceedings. Article 114 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984 provides that when a person has by his 
declaration, act or omission intentionally caused or permitted 
another person to believe a thing to be true and to act upon such 
belief, neither he nor his representative is allowed in any suit or 
proceedings between the parties to deny the truth of that thing. 
This provision enacts a rule of evidence whereby a person is not 
allowed to plead contrary to a fact or a state of thing which he 
formerly asserted as existing and made the other party to believe 
it as such and then acted on it on such belief. In fact, this 
principle is founded on equity and justness with straightforward 
objective to prevent fraud and ensure justice. Reference can be 
made to Sardar Ali Khan v. State Bank of Pakistan and others 
(2022 SCMR 1454), Combind Investment (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Wali Bhai 
and others (PLD 2016 Supreme Court 730), Mst. Ghazala Zakir v. 
Muhammad Khurshid and 7 others (1997 CLC 167), Muhammad 
Majid Iqbal through Special Attorney v. Judge Family Court, 
Dunya Pur and 2 others (2021 CLC 644), Pakistan through 
Secretary, Ministry of Defence, Islamabad and 2 others v. Wadero 
Lal Bux (2021 CLC 1609) and Mushtaq Ahmad v. Mohsinn Iqbal 
(2022 CLC 1461).  
6. 
The Latin maxim “Qui Approbat non Reprobat” quite 
literally 
translates 
to “the 
one 
who 
approbates, 
cannot 
reprobate” or “that which I approve, I cannot disapprove”. The 
Doctrine of Approbate and Reprobate was established upon the 
Scottish laws and is now an essential principle of equity. To 
approve or reject anything is to approbate or reprobate. A person 
cannot approbate and reprobate something simultaneously, 
according to the law. The Doctrine of Approbate and Reprobate is 
also commonly known as the ‘Doctrine of Election’ in English 
Law. 
The 
Doctrine 
of 
Election 
bases 
itself 
upon 
the 
maxim “Allegans contraria non est audiendus” which means when 

 
 
RFA No.10241 of 2023& connected cases

people make comments that contradict one another, they will not be 
heard. Certain principles for application of doctrine of Approbate 
and Reprobate were also enunciated by High Court of Justice 
Queen’s Bench in the case of MBP v. LGK [2020] EWHC 90 
(TCC), which read as under:- 
“58. 
All the same, certain principles arise from the case law taken 
as a whole: 
i)  
The first is that the approbating party must have 
elected, that is made his choice, clearly and 
unequivocally; 
ii) 
 The second is that it is usual but not necessary for 
the electing party to have taken a benefit from his 
election such as where he has taken a benefit under 
an instrument such as a will; 
iii)  
Thirdly, the electing party's subsequent conduct must 
be inconsistent with his earlier election or 
approbation. 
 
In essence, the doctrine is about preventing inconsistent 
conduct and ensuring a just outcome.” 
 
In these cases, the appellants in unequivocal terms agreed to 
pay back the remaining claim of respondents, which resulted into 
passing the impugned judgment; therefore, they are not allowed to 
challenge the same decision by filing the appeals.  Reliance is 
placed on Haji Ghulam Rasool and others v. The Chief 
Administrator of Auqaf, West Pakistan (PLD 1971 Supreme Court 
376), Muhammad Sharif and 13 others v. Inayat Ullah and 24 
others (1996 SCMR 145), Overseas Pakistanis Foundation and 
others v. Sqn. Ldr. (Retd.) Syed Mukhtar Ali Shah and another 
(2007 SCMR 569) and Shahzada Aman-e-Room and others v. 
Sher Bahadar Khan and others (2022 YLR 2295). 
7. 
There is only one contention of learned counsel for appellants 
that learned Insurance Tribunal was obliged to dispose of 
applications for impleading Pakistan Re Insurance Company 
Limited as party and seeking amendment in written reply before 
deciding the main petition. It is observed that in view of afore-noted 

 
 
RFA No.10241 of 2023& connected cases 
5
admissions of appellants, these applications have no material 
bearing on the merits of the case. Even otherwise, Pakistan Re 
Insurance Company, Limited is not privy to the contracts executed 
between appellants and respondents and the stance of appellants is 
that they had made arrangements for reinsurance with aforesaid 
insurance company, whereby said company is bound to share the 
loss out of which certain payments had already been made to 
appellants, however the remaining was not being paid without 
lawful excuse. In our opinion, such claim / stance has no link with 
the respondents’ claim and cannot be a basis for impleading the said 
insurance company as party in litigation between respondents and 
appellants. Moreover, it is not persistent rule that in all 
eventualities, the miscellaneous applications ought to have been 
decided before final determination of the controversy because 
this principle is adhered to for the sake of justice. If the matter is 
otherwise conclusively determined by the Court, the sole factum 
of indecision of some application(s) shall not frustrate the 
proceedings / verdict of the Court. Guidance can be taken from 
dictum laid down in Peer Bakhsh and others v. Nabi Bakhsh and 
others (2002 YLR 1630), Hashwani Hotels Limited through Senior 
Manager v. Sindh Insurance Tribunal, Karachi and 3 others (2016 
CLD 1790) and Mst. Mairaj Bibi and 4 others v. Muhammad 
Shafique through L.Rs. and others (PLD 2020 Lahore 888). 
8. 
In view of the above, instant as well as connected appeals, 
being devoid of merits, are dismissed in limine.
