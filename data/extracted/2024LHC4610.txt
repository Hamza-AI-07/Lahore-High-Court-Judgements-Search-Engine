Muhammad Tariq Nadeem. J:- Shahid Ali alias Makhi appellant 
was tried by the court of Additional Sessions Judge, Lahore, in case FIR 
No.336 dated 31.07.2015, offence under sections 302, 34 PPC, registered 
at Police Station Hair, Lahore and after conclusion of trial, vide judgment 
dated 30.06.2018, he was convicted under section 302(b) PPC and 
sentenced to Imprisonment for Life with the direction to pay 
compensation for an amount of Rs.2,00,000/- to the legal heirs of 
Muhammad Ijaz (deceased) as provided under section 544-A Cr.P.C. The 
amount of compensation was ordered to be recovered from the appellant as 
arrears of land revenue and if recovered, the same shall be distributed 
amongst the legal heirs of deceased according to their Shari shares and in 
case of default thereof, the appellant shall further undergo simple 
imprisonment for six months. However, he was given the benefit of 
section 382-B Cr.P.C.  
Feeling aggrieved from the judgment of the trial court, the appellant 
has assailed his conviction and sentence through the captioned criminal 
appeal.  
2. 
Brief facts of the case as narrated by Abdul Majeed complainant 
(PW.3) in complaint (Exh.PA) on the basis of which FIR (Exh.PA/1) was 
registered are that on 31.07.2015, he was away from his house in 
connection with some work. At about 06:00 p.m. Muhammad Saddique 
telephonically informed that Shahid alias Makhi (appellant), by giving 
kicks and fists blows to his son Muhammad Ijaz in front of house of Abdul 

Crl. Appeal No.234893-J of 2018

Rehman, made him unconscious and asked the complainant to reach at the 
clinic of Doctor Kamran where Muhammad Saddique and Basit were 
going to shift the injured for medical treatment. When he (complainant) 
reached the clinic, his son Muhammad Ijaz had breathed his lost. Shahid 
Ali alias Makhi and three unknown accused persons took to their heels 
while raising lalkaras. Hence, the above-mentioned crime report.  
3. 
  After completion of investigation, report under section 173 Cr.P.C. 
was submitted against the appellant. On indictment, the appellant pleaded 
not guilty and claimed trial. In order to bring home the guilt of the 
appellant, the prosecution got examined as many as ten witnesses amongst 
whom Muhammad Saddique (PW.1) and Basit Ali (PW.2) have furnished 
the ocular account. Abdul Majeed complainant (PW.3) reiterated the 
contents of complaint (Exh.PA). Syed Muhammad Younus Bukhari, 
draftsman (PW.6) prepared scaled site plan of the place of occurrence 
(Exh.PD and Exh.PD/1). Asghar Ali S.I (PW.8) being investigating officer 
stated about various steps taken by him during investigation of the case. 
Medical evidence was furnished by Doctor Muhammad Akmal Karim 
(PW.9), who while posted as Demonstrator, KEMU, Lahore, conducted 
autopsy on the dead body of Muhammad Ijaz (deceased) and issued his 
postmortem report (Exh.PK). 
 
The remaining prosecution witnesses, more or less, are formal in 
nature. The prosecution gave up Gulzar Ahmad S.I  (being dead), Ahmad 
Namdar 13486/C and Muhammad Nadeem, PWs being unnecessary and 
after tendering in evidence the Forensic Toxicology Analysis Report 
(Exh.PL) and Forensic Histopathology Report (Exh.PM), closed its 
evidence.  
4. 
After completion of prosecution evidence, statement under section 
342 Cr. P.C. of the appellant was recorded wherein he denied the 
allegations levelled against him and claimed his innocence. While 
answering to a question, “why this case against you and why the PWs have 
deposed against you? appellant replied as under:- 
“I am innocent. Son of the complainant was done to death by 
beating of three unknown persons but complainant did not 
nominate 
said 
three 
unknown 
persons 
because 
the 
complainant taken huge money from them. The name of three 
unknown persons who beaten the complainant’s son Ijaz i.e.

Sakhi son of Allah Rakha, Majid son of Rafique Ali and 
Mudassar alias Jassy son of Yousaf Ali. Complainant and 
other PWs have previous enmity with me. Complainant and 
other PWs conceal the real facts and due to previous enmity 
involve me falsely in this case. Complainant, Basat Ali and 
Saddique they were not eye witnesses of the occurrence. Due 
to strong relation and conspiracy with each other involved me 
in this case. During the investigation nothing was recovered 
by me. I have no link with this occurrence… ” 
 
 
 
He neither opted to appear as his own witness within the scope of 
section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor produced any evidence in his defence. 
5. 
The trial court vide judgment dated 30.06.2018 held the appellant 
guilty, convicted and sentenced him as mentioned above, hence, this 
criminal appeal.  
6. 
Learned counsel for the appellant contended that the appellant is 
absolutely innocent and has been involved in this case by the complainant 
and other prosecution witnesses on the basis of their mala fide intentions 
and ulterior motives; that in fact the occurrence was committed by three 
accused namely Sakhi, Majid and Mudassar alias Jassy, but they were 
never nominated by the complainant party, however, the appellant has 
been made a scapegoat because of his previous enmity with the 
complainant party. He further contended that Abdul Majeed complainant 
(PW.3) was not an eye witness of the occurrence and his evidence was 
based on hearsay whereas remaining two private witnesses of the 
prosecution namely Muhammad Saddique (PW.1) and Basit Ali (PW.2) 
were also not present at the time and place of occurrence. He added that 
postmortem examination on the dead body of deceased was conducted 
with the delay of seventeen hours, which strongly indicates that time was 
consumed in arranging eye witness account and then a story qua the 
occurrence was fabricated by complainant party just to falsely implicate 
the appellant. He further maintained that the prosecution has miserably 
failed to substantiate the factum of accusation by producing worthy of 
credence evidence which aspect of the matter went unnoticed, causing 
serious prejudice against the appellant. It is also argued that the medical 
evidence also goes against the stance of the appellant and it does not prove 
that the deceased in this case met with an unnatural death. Lastly prayed 

Crl. Appeal No.234893-J of 2018 
4
that the appeal be accepted and the appellant may be acquitted of the 
charge.  
7. 
On the other hand, learned Deputy Prosecutor General assisted by 
learned counsel for the complainant vehemently opposed the contentions 
raised by learned counsel for the appellant and inter alia argued that the 
appellant is named in a promptly lodged FIR with specific role which is 
fully established by the medical evidence. Further argued that the 
complainant and the eye witnesses had no earthly reason whatsoever to 
falsely implicate the appellant in this case and although appellant has 
alleged about existence of his previous enmity with the complainant party, 
but he has not brought on record a single iota of evidence to establish this 
fact. Next argued that the complainant and the eye witnesses were blood 
relatives of the deceased and being so, they cannot be expected to falsely 
implicate the appellant that too by letting off the actual perpetrator of 
offence. It is strenuously argued that the eye witnesses have successfully 
proved their presence at the spot as well as having seen the tragedy with 
their own eyes with the role played by appellant during the occurrence is 
proved and it is also established that the deceased had met with an 
unnatural death due to the injuries caused by the appellant. Finally, they 
argued that since the prosecution has proved its case against the appellant 
beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt, therefore, the appeal filed by him 
merits dismissal. 
8. 
I have given anxious hearing to the arguments of learned counsel for 
the appellant as well as learned Deputy Prosecutor General assisted by 
learned counsel for the complainant and perused the record with their able 
assistance. 
9. 
It is a matter of record as mentioned in FIR (Exh.PA/1) that on 
31.07.2015 at about 06:00 p.m. Abdul Majeed complainant (PW.3) 
received a telephonic call from Muhammad Saddique (PW.1) to the effect 
that his son Muhammad Ijaz had become unconscious as a result of kicks 
and fists blows given by Shahid Ali alias Makhi appellant. In this way, 
occurrence in the present case had taken place just prior to 06:00 p.m. on 
31.07.2015 and on the same evening, the matter was reported to the police 
by Abdul Majeed complainant (PW.3) at 06:15 p.m. through written 

Crl. Appeal No.234893-J of 2018 
5
application (Exh.PA) and thereafter FIR (Exh.PA/1) was chalked out at 
06:30 p.m. at Police Station Hair, Lahore, which was located at a distance 
of seven kilometers from the place of occurrence. In FIR (Exh.PA/1), the 
name of Shahid Ali alias Makhi appellant with his role of giving kicks and 
fists blows to the deceased has been specifically mentioned. I am, 
therefore, of the view that the matter in this case was reported to the police 
within reasonable time which hardly left any chance of consultation or 
deliberation in the intervening period. Reliance is placed upon the case-
laws titled as “Muhammad Bashir and another vs. The State and others” 
(2023 SCMR 190) and “Abdul Wahid vs. The State” (2023 SCMR 1278).  
10. 
According to the narration of FIR (Exh.PA/1) itself, it can be seen 
that Abdul Majeed complainant (PW.3) had not himself witnessed the 
tragedy rather he was informed by Muhammad Saddique (PW.1) about the 
incident, however, he (PW.3) has specifically mentioned therein the names 
of Muhammad Saddique (PW.1) and Basit Ali (PW.2) as the witnesses, 
who were present at the place of occurrence at relevant time and had seen 
the appellant while giving kicks and fists blows to the deceased on the 
backdrop of a grudge of their previous altercation and even while 
appearing in the witness box before the trial court, he did not back-away 
even an inch from his stance. In this way, Abdul Majeed complainant 
(PW.3) has shown his bona fide by not standing up as an eye witness of 
the occurrence regarding the murder of his real son Muhammad Ijaz.  
11. 
As noted above, Abdul Majeed complainant (PW.3) was not an eye 
witness of the occurrence, therefore, the prosecution has mainly relied 
upon the statements of two eye witnesses namely Muhammad Saddique 
(PW.1) and Basit Ali (PW.2), who happened to be the close relatives of 
Muhammad Ijaz (deceased) inasmuch as PW.1 was his paternal uncle 
whereas PW.2 was his paternal cousin. While appearing in the witness box 
before the trial court, they remained in comfortable unison with each other 
on all aspects of the case. They vigorously pointed their accusing fingers 
towards the appellant with specific attribution of giving kicks and fists 
blows to the deceased and despite lengthy cross-examination by the 
defence counsel, nothing favourable to the appellant could be extracted 
from their mouths.  

Crl. Appeal No.234893-J of 2018

So far as the contention of learned counsel for the appellant that 
none of the eye witnesses produced by the prosecution before the trial 
court were present at the time and place of occurrence is concerned, I have 
observed that both Muhammad Saddique (PW.1) and Basit Ali (PW.2) 
have given specific reasoning qua their presence at the time and place of 
occurrence, which even otherwise could not be shattered by the defence 
while conducting cross-examination on them. Furthermore, it was a 
daylight occurrence and the parties being the residents of same locality 
were also previously known to each other, therefore, there was no chance 
of misidentification of the appellant. Muhammad Saddique (PW.1) has 
stated in his examination-in-chief as under:- 
“On 31.07.2015 at about 06:00 p.m. I alongwith Basit Ali son of 
Muhammad Latif were present at my shop situated at Natha Sigh 
Wala. We heard voice. We attracted towards the place of noise and 
saw accused Shahid alias Makhi was present near the gate of Abdul 
Rehman and he was giving kicks and fists to Muhammad Ijaz.” 
 
During the cross-examination, he (PW.1) stated about his abode and 
shop as infra: - 
“Distance between the place of occurrence and my house is 50/60 feet. 
……….………………………………………………………………….………
……….………………………………………………………………….……… 
Distance between my shop and place of occurrence is 16/17 karams.” 
 
I have noted that almost same is the statement of Basit Ali (PW.2). 
Relevant lines of his examination-in-chief read as under:- 
“On 31.07.2015 (Friday) at about 06:00 p.m. I alongwith Saddique 
son of Ahmad Din were present at the shop of Saddique situated at 
Natha Singh. We heard noise and upon listening ran towards the 
place of noise. We saw Shahid Ali Makhi was giving physical torture 
to Ijaz with kicks and fists near the gate of Abdul Rehman 
Lambardar……” 
 
More so, upon the cross-examination by defence counsel, he (PW.2) 
further explained the distance of his house and place of his presence from where 
he reached at the place of occurrence. Relevant lines of his replies in cross-
examination are mentioned below: -  
“My house is situated at a distance of 10 karams from place 
of occurrence and there are two streets in between. It is incorrect 
that my house is at a distance 3/4 acres from the place of 
occurrence. I also work as electrician.  
…………………………………………………………………………………
………………………………………………………………………………… 
 It is incorrect to suggest that distance between Saddique shop and 
my house is 1500/2000 feet. There is distance of 15/16 karams 
between shop of Muhammad Saddique and place of occurrence. The 

Crl. Appeal No.234893-J of 2018 
7
shop of Saddique remains open during week days however, it is 
closed in case of any acute need.” 
 
In the light of above mentioned circumstances, I am quite confident 
to hold that Muhammad Saddique (PW.1) and Basit Ali (PW.2) are 
truthful witnesses and their presence at the spot at the time of occurrence is 
natural. Reliance is placed upon the case-laws titled as “Muhammad 
Akram alias Akrai vs. The State” (2019 SCMR 610), “Ghaffar Mahesar 
vs. The State through P.G Sindh and others” (2022 SCMR 1280) and 
“Muhammad Yasin and another vs. The State and others” (2024 SCMR 
128). 
 
Learned counsel for the appellant has also brought the depositions 
of eye witnesses under attack on account of their close relationship with 
the deceased as well as existence of their previous enmity with the 
appellant. With regard to the objection qua close relationship, it is settled 
proposition of law that mere relationship of eye witnesses with the 
deceased by itself is no ground to disbelieve their evidence. Similarly the 
contention of learned counsel for the appellant about existence of previous 
enmity between the appellant and the complainant party is merely an oral 
assertion which could not be established by the defence during the trial. 
Not a single piece of convincing evidence has been brought on the record 
by the defence to substantiate that the complainant or the eye witnesses 
had deposed falsely due to their close relationship with the deceased or 
existence of their previous enmity with the appellant rather I am convinced 
that their evidence is consistent, straightforward, trustworthy, confidence 
inspiring and reliable and as such, their evidence against the appellant 
cannot be discarded merely on the basis of aforementioned oral assertions 
of learned counsel for the appellant. Guidance in this respect has been 
sought from the case-laws titled as “Ali Asghar alias Aksar vs. The State” 
(2023 SCMR 596), “Aman Ullah and another vs. The State and others” 
(2023 SCMR 723), “Imran Mehmood vs. The State and another” (2023 
SCMR 795) and “Khalid vs. The State through PG Sindh” (2024 SCMR 
1474).  
 
More so, I am of the view that in the absence of any previous ill-
will, malice, animosity or grudge against the appellant, it was highly 
unlikely for the complainant or the eye witnesses to make the appellant a 

Crl. Appeal No.234893-J of 2018 
8
scapegoat by letting off the actual perpetrators of the offence. It is by now 
well settled law that substitution of real culprits especially in cases where 
the eye witnesses lost their kith and kin before their own eyes is rare 
phenomenon. Reliance is placed on the cases titled as “Aqil vs. The State” 
(2023 SCMR 831), “Muhammad Ijaz vs. The State” (2023 SCMR 1375) 
and “Muhammad Shafique vs. The State Muhammad Imran and another” 
(2024 SCMR 814).  
12. 
  Although, the appellant has seriously criticized in his statement 
under section 342 Cr.P.C. that instead of him, three other accused had 
committed the murder of deceased. In this regard, I may observe here that 
the eye witnesses remained consistent throughout that the appellant was 
principal accused who gave kicks and fists blows to the deceased and 
subsequently medical evidence proved that one of those kicks and fists 
blows proved fatal and left no room for the survival of deceased. The 
defence miserably failed to shatter the evidence of above-said witnesses. 
The above version adopted by the appellant appears to be an afterthought 
story fabricated by him in order to save his skin. I may also observe here 
that when an accused takes particular stance, onus to prove such stance 
shifts upon him but in this case, the defence did not produce any evidence 
in support of the plea of the appellant. Hence, I am of the view that 
defence has failed to substantiate its version.  
13. 
Apart from the unblemished depositions of eye witnesses namely 
Muhammad Saddique (PW.1) and Basit Ali (PW.2), I have observed that 
medical evidence is in complete harmony with the ocular testimonies and 
no conflict could be pointed out to create dent in the prosecution case. The 
injuries attributed by the eye witnesses to the appellant were duly observed 
by the doctor on the person of Muhammad Ijaz (deceased) at the time of 
conducting autopsy on his dead body and issuing postmortem report 
(Exh.PK). Furthermore, ocular evidence about the time of incident as well 
as the nature of injuries as narrated by the eye witnesses has also fully 
tallied with medical evidence. It may be observed here that Doctor 
Muhammad Akmal Karim (PW.9) was also subjected to grueling cross-
examination but nothing beneficial to the appellant could be extracted 
from him. 

Crl. Appeal No.234893-J of 2018

14. 
Much emphasis has been laid by learned defence counsel upon the 
delay in conducting autopsy on the dead body of deceased. Although, it is 
an undisputed fact that the autopsy in this case was conducted about 
seventeen hours after the occurrence but the question of paramount 
consideration still remains that whether intervening time was consumed by 
the prosecution in fabricating any story or arranging eye witness account 
of the case. To resolve this controversy, I have observed that the FIR 
(Exh.PA/1) had been chalked out by Muhammad Kamran ASI (PW.4) on 
the basis of written application (Exh.PA) of Abdul Majeed complainant 
(PW.3) within about half an hour after the occurrence. In his examination-
in-chief, Muhammad Kamran ASI (PW.4) has stated as under:- 
“On 31.07.2015, I was posted at Police Station hair. On the 
same day, complaint Ex-PA was received by me through Niaz 
Ahmad 21116/C to the police station for registration of FIR on 
the basis of which I drafted the FIR No. 336/15 Ex-PA/1 for 
the offence under section 302/34 PPC at Police Station Hair. I 
registered the same without any omission or deletion.” 
 
During cross-examination upon Muhammad Kamran ASI (PW.4) 
not a single question has been put to him that the FIR (Exh.PA/1) was not 
chalked out on the date and time mentioned in the relevant column. The 
whole cross-examination conducted by the defence on Muhammad 
Kamran ASI (PW.4) is also reproduced hereunder:- 
“Niaz Ahmad constable brought complaint before me for 
registration of FIR. He came to me at 06:30 p.m. I 
immediately lodged FIR. Niaz Ahmad constable submitted a 
single application.” 
 
The above fact emphatically explains that the FIR (Exh.PA/1) had 
been registered prior to escorting the dead body of deceased to mortuary 
and in FIR (Exh.PA/1), all the details regarding the occurrence particularly 
the time, place and mode of occurrence as well as the names of assailant, 
deceased and eye witnesses have been sufficiently explained in a natural 
manner.  
 
However, if relying on the contention of learned counsel for the 
appellant, it is still presumed for the time being that the intervening time of 
occurrence and autopsy was used in fabricating a story and maneuvering 
the eye witness account, then it must have been for Abdul Majeed 
complainant (PW.3) himself to step forward as an eye witness of the 
tragedy and implicate maximum persons from appellant’s family after 

Crl. Appeal No.234893-J of 2018 
10
noticing as many as nine injuries on the body of his deceased son, 
however, Abdul Majeed complainant (PW.3) simply stated that he was 
away from the place of occurrence and was telephonically informed by 
one of the eye witnesses namely Muhammad Saddique (PW.1) that the 
appellant, alone, had caused all the injuries by giving kicks and fists blows 
on the body of deceased and on seeing the eye witnesses namely 
Muhammad Saddique (PW.1) and Basit Ali (PW.2), he took to his heels 
while leaving the deceased unconscious.  
 
Besides, it is also a circumstance that the dead body of deceased 
was shifted in the mortuary of King Edward Medical University, Lahore, 
on 31.07.2015 at 08:20 p.m. where senior doctors usually do not remain 
available during night-time and on the next morning i.e. 01.08.2015 at 
11:00 a.m. autopsy was conducted by Doctor Muhammad Akmal Karim 
(PW.9), who was a Demonstrator in Department of Forensic Medicine and 
Toxicology at King Edward Medical University, Lahore. It seems that 
conducting of autopsy on the dead body of deceased was deferred for 
following day to wait the concerned doctor. Keeping in view the above 
highlighted facts of the case, I am satisfied that the time between the 
happening of occurrence and conducting autopsy was not consumed by the 
prosecution in fabricating any story or arranging eye witness account of 
the case. Even otherwise, I am not inclined to discard the overwhelming 
eye witness account which is evenly supported by the medical evidence, 
merely because of a single circumstance that autopsy in this case was 
conducted about seventeen hours after the occurrence without there being 
any element of concoction or fabrication of prosecution’s case against the 
appellant. While dealing with almost identical proposition, learned 
Division Bench of this Court in the case titled as “Zaheer Ahmad vs. The 
State” (2014 YLR 967) has held as under:- 
“It has been observed by us that the matter was reported to the police on 
the application submitted by Muhammad Latif complainant  without any 
delay as the occurrence  took  place  in  this  case  on  4-4-2006 at 1-20 
pm and the F.I.R. had been chalked out al the same day at 1-50 p.m. 
within a span of thirty minutes whereas the Police Station is 2 kilometers 
away towards North from the place of occurrence. So the matter has been 
reported in this case with sufficient promptitude and there is no 
unconscionable or inexcusable delay in registration of the F.I.R. While 
referring the Post-mortem Examination Report the learned counsel for the 
appellant seriously contend that the Dr. Rafaqat Ali (P.W.7) had 
conducted the post-mortem of the deceased on 5-4-2006 at 12-15 p.m. with 

Crl. Appeal No.234893-J of 2018 
11
one day delay which shows that first the matter was consulted and 
thereafter with active connivance of the police the F.I.R. was lodged. In 
this context we have minutely perused the Post-mortem Examination 
Report of the deceased wherein it has specifically been mentioned that the 
deadbody was lodged in hospital on 4-4-2006 at 4-15 p.m. If there is any 
delay that is on the part of doctor and delay alone cannot destroy the 
prosecution case in presence of the confidence inspiring evidence. Thus, 
we have not seen any element of consultations or deliberations over the 
matter on the part of the prosecution” 
 
I am also fortified from the wisdom laid down by the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in the cases titled as “Muhammad Saleem vs. The State” 
[PLJ 2019 SC (Cr.C.) 425], “Muhammad Asif and others vs. Mehboob 
Alam and others” (2020 SCMR 837) and “Maskeen Ullah and another vs. 
The State and another” (2023 SCMR 1568). 
15.   Learned counsel for the appellant has argued with vehemence that if 
for the sake of arguments the prosecution is believed to have proved its 
case whereby the prosecution has saddled the appellant merely with the 
responsibility of giving kicks and fists blows to the deceased, even then 
the appellant cannot be held responsible for his murder, because, it was a 
case of natural death caused by heart attack in the light of prosecution’s 
own medical evidence. In this context, it is noteworthy that the autopsy on 
the dead body of Muhammad Ijaz (deceased) was conducted by Doctor 
Muhammad Akmal Karim (PW.9), who observed nine injuries in the 
shape of multiple bruises and an abrasion on different parts of body of 
deceased, which are reproduced as infra:- 
Injury No. 1 
A bruised area measuring 1.3 x 0.8 cm present on left 
ear pinna. 
Injury No. 2 
Multiple bruised area 5 in number present on left side 
of chest on front latterly spread in an area measuring 10 x 12 
cm. Smallest measuring 0.5 x 0.5 cm and largest measuring 1 
x 1 cm. 
Injury No. 3 
Multiple bruised areas on front of left arm 4 in number, 
the smallest measuring 0.5 x 0.5 cm and largest measuring 0.7 
x 0.7 cm. Spread in an area measuring 7 x 5 cm.  
Injury No. 4 
A bruised area measuring 1 x 1 cm on left side of 
abdomen, 6 cm from left iliac rest, 7 cm from umbilicus. 
Injury No. 5 

Crl. Appeal No.234893-J of 2018 
12
A bruised area measuring 2.5 x 2 cm on front of upper 
part of left thigh, 5 cm below iliac rest on front, 30 cm above 
left knee. 
Injury No. 6 
A abrasion measuring 0.5 x 0.3 cm on the inner 
malleolus of left leg. 
Injury No. 7 
A bruised area measuring 4 x 5 cm on inner side of 
right thigh and adjacent area on front of thigh at upper most 
part, 13 cm above right knee. 
Injury No. 8 
A bruised measuring 3 x 2 cm on inner side of right 
thigh, 10 cm below inner side of thigh, 11 cm above knee. 
Injury No. 9 
A bruised measuring 1.8 x 1 cm present on left 
scrotum.” 
 
After postmortem examination, the doctor waited for the reports of 
Toxicology and Histopathology Sections of Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore, and upon receipts of aforementioned reports, he gave his 
final opinion as under: - 
Final Opinion:- 
 
I have perused the reports received from toxicology 
section and histopathology section of Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore and my final opinion is as under: - 
 
The circumstances of death autopsy findings, negative 
forensic toxicology report and unremarkable findings in 
histopathology report mentioned supra are suggestive of death 
due to vasovagal shock consequent of blunt trauma to testis 
under injury No.9 mentioned in autopsy report.  
 
The expression “vasovagal” has been defined in Parikh’s Textbook 
of Medical Jurisprudence, Forensic Medicine and Toxicology (for 
Classrooms and Courtrooms) as under: - 
"Syncope: This is death from failure of function of the heart 
resulting in hypo- perfusion and hypoxia of the brain. It is due 
to (1) heart disease, (2) haemorrhage, (3) pathological states 
of blood, (4) exhausting disease, or (5) poisoning due to 
digitalis, potassium, aconite or oleander. At autopsy, the heart 
appears contracted. It contains very little blood, if death is 
due to haemorrhage. The viscera appear pale and the 
capillaries congested. 
 
A syncopal type of death may also result from reflex 
cardiac arrest due to: 
 
1. Vagal stimulation, commonly known as vasovagal 
shock, vagal inhibition or neuro-genic shock. 

Crl. Appeal No.234893-J of 2018 
13
2. Rarely ventricular fibrillation due to cardiac 
problems 
or 
spontaneous 
sympathetic 
nervous 
discharge. 
 
Vagal inhibition is important in certain cases of 
accidental hanging; throttling (manual strangulation); blow 
to the epigastrium; abortion; emotional tension; sudden 
immersion of the body in cold water; insertion of an 
instrument into the uterus. Bladder, rectum or any other body 
cavity; and light anaesthesia. In these conditions, as the 
trauma may be very trivial, the injury is not visible. Therefore, 
there are no characteristic post-mortem appearance and the 
cause of death is inferred from the history and negative 
findings, viz. no natural disease, injury or poisoning, to 
account for the cause of death." 
 
 
In another Textbook of Forensic Medicine Principles and Practice 
(First Edition of 2001), authored by Krishan Vij, Professor and Head of 
the Department of Forensic Medicine, Government Medical College, 
Chandigarh, the term “Vagal Inhibition” has been defined as follows: - 
"Vagal Inhibition: -- Also variously known as Vasovagal 
attack, reflex cardiac arrest, nervous apoplexy, instantaneous 
physiological death or syncope with instantaneous exitus-or 
primary neurogenic shock. This state is characterised by 
sudden stoppage of heart following reflex stimulation of vagus 
nerve endings. There is a wide network of sensory nerve 
supply to the skin, pharynx, larynx, pleura, peritoneum 
covering the abdominal organs or extending to the sprermatic 
cord, uterine cervix, for the reflex action and pass through the 
lateral tracts of spinal cord, effect the local reflex connections 
over the spinal segments and then travel to the vagus nucleus 
in the brain. The vagus nucleus has connections with sensory 
cerebral cortex and thalamus, besides the spinal cord, as 
stated. The efferent then originate from there and affect the 
heart through the related branches. 
Such deaths occur with dramatic suddenness within seconds 
or at the most in a few minutes. The loss of consciousness is 
usually instantaneous on these occasions and death follows 
soon afterwards. Consequently, the mobility is negligible and 
the victim is likely to be found in the posture/position in which 
he/she was at the time of death. The condition, therefore, is 
characterised by fulminating circulatory failure which may be 
attributed either to reflex slowing/stoppage of heart, reflex 
vasodilatation leading to profound fall in blood pressure or a 
varying combination of both the mechanisms. The victims are 
usually young adolescents of nervous temperament but anyone 
may be susceptible. The factor responsible for initiating or 
triggering the vaso-vagal phenomenon may be aminor trauma 
or relatively simple and harmless peripheral stimulation at the 
vulnerable sites upon the body as described earlier. Obviously 
therefore, a variety of circumstances have been incriminated 
as precipitating factors, as outlined below:

Sudden pressure over the neck especially over the region of 
carotid sinuses as may be operating in occasional cases of 
strangulation and hanging (Carotid sinus is a dilated part of 
the wall of the carotid artery and contains numerous nerve 
ending from the glossopharyn-geal nerve and communicates 
with the medullary cardiovascular center and dorsal-motor 
nucleus of vagus in the brain, related with the control of blood 
pressure and regulation of heart-activity). Such deaths are of 
considerable medicolegal significance as death may ensue 
under the circumstances in which there had been no intention 
to kill. In some instances it may be reasonable to regard such 
deaths as borderline between a natural and an accidental 
death. Sudden blow on the abdomen or scrotum, larynx or 
genital organs. During intubation of, or from impaction of 
food/some other material into the larynx....." 
 
In Jaising P. Modi’s Textbook of Medical Jurisprudence and 
Toxicology (Twenty Seventh Edition), vagal inhibition has been explained 
as infra: - 
" Vagal Inhibition 
Vagal inhibition causes sudden cardiac arrest from fright or 
terror, or it may be caused during a sudden and unexpected 
fall in the water, often the water striking against the chest and 
the pit of the stomach. The sudden impingement of unduly cold 
water on the nasopharyax, can result in vagal inhibition. The 
ability to swim in ice-cold water (4.7°C) is much less than in 
warm water due to increased respiratory reflexes causing 
breathlessness in the thin man, and hypothermia in the fat 
person. This may explain sudden death in cold water.” 
 
 
Dr. K.S. Narayan Reddy in his Book “Medical Jurisprudence and 
Toxicology (Law Practice & Procedure) has elucidated the “reflex vagal 
inhibition” in the following words: - 
 
"(2) Reflex Vagal Inhibition: In this, there may not be 
visible external injury.  
 
(3) SHOCK: Shock is a circulatory disturbance 
characterised by hypoperfusion of cells and tissues due to 
reduction in the volume of blood or cardiac output, or 
redistribution of blood resulting in a decrease of effective 
circulating volume. 
 
Primary Shock: Primary or neurogenic shock (vaso-vagal 
shock or reflex cardiac arrest) results from a sudden 
reduction of venous return to the heart due to neurogenic 
vasodilation with pooling of blood in the peripheral vascular 
bed, especially in the subclavian area. There is yawning, 
sighing respirations, nausea and vomiting followed by 
unconsciousness, but the attack rarely lasts for more than a 
few minutes. There is pallor, coldness of the extremities, weak 
rapid pulse and low blood pressure. The cardiac output is 
unchanged. It may follow any form of stress. Psychological 
factors, such as fear, grief, anxiety, emotion and pain due to

various causes also play a large part. It may occur when a few 
ml. of blood are withdrawn, or from the sight of blood or an 
anticipation of injection. 
 
 
Coming to the contention raised by learned counsel for the appellant 
that it was a case of natural death, at the cost of repetition it is mentioned 
here that as per final opinion given by Doctor Muhammad Akmal Karim 
(PW.9), Demonstrator, King Edward Medical University Lahore, blunt 
trauma to testis under injury No.9 (mentioned above) had resulted in 
vasovagal inhibition/shock and death of Muhammad Ijaz (deceased), 
therefore, keeping in view the above legal and factual position of the case, 
death due to vasovagal inhibition/shock cannot be termed as natural. I am 
of the view that no doubt is left that it is a case of homicidal death of 
Muhammad Ijaz (deceased) due to the assault extended by the appellant by 
giving kicks and fists blows on different parts of his body, particularly his 
left scrotum which is one of the most sensitive parts of male human’s 
body.  
16. 
Having reappraised the prosecution evidence, I have come to an 
irresistible conclusion that the prosecution has produced sufficient tangible 
and confidence inspiring ocular account furnished by eye witnesses 
namely Muhammad Saddique (PW.1) and Basit Ali (PW.2) which is 
explicitly supported by the medical evidence that successfully brought 
home the guilt of the appellant on the charge of giving kicks and fists 
blows to Muhammad Ijaz (deceased) which ultimately led to the latter’s 
unnatural death. However, I am not satisfied with appellant’s conviction 
and sentence on the charge under section 302(b) PPC because in the light 
of facts and circumstances of the case, I am of the view that the mischief 
for which the appellant has been handed down a guilty verdict does not 
come within the purview of “qatl-i-amd” as defined in section 302 PPC 
rather keeping in view the mode and manner in which the appellant had 
committed the occurrence by giving kicks and fists blows to the deceased 
on the backdrop of a grudge of their previous altercation, I am convinced 
that his case falls within the scope of “qatl shibh-i-amd” as defined in 
section 315 PPC and made punishable under section 316 PPC, which 

Crl. Appeal No.234893-J of 2018 
16
along with an illustration, for the purpose of reference, are mentioned 
below:- 
“315. Qatl shibh-i-amd: Whoever, with intent to cause harm 
to the body or mind of any person, causes the death of that or 
of any other person by means of a weapon or an act which in 
the ordinary course of nature is not likely to cause death is 
said to commit qatl shibh-i-amd. 
Illustration 
A in order to cause hurt strikes Z with a stick or stone which 
in the ordinary course of nature is not likely to cause death. Z 
dies as a result of such hurt. A shall be guilty of Qatl shibh-i-
amd” 
316. Punishment for Qatl shibh-i-amd: Whoever commits 
qatl shibh-i-amd shall be liable to diyat and may also be 
punished with imprisonment of either description for a term 
which may extend to  [twenty-five years]  years as ta'zir. 
 
17. 
As a result of what has been discussed above, the conviction and 
sentence awarded by the trial court to the appellant on the charge under 
section 302(b) PPC is set aside and while convicting him under section 
316 PPC, I sentence him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of 
10-years on account of committing “qatl shibh-i-amd” of Muhammad Ijaz 
(deceased) and in addition thereof, he is also held liable to pay Diyat to the 
legal heirs of deceased. So far as the question that whether convict is liable 
to pay amount of Diyat prevailing in the year when the occurrence had 
taken place or the year when the matter is decided is concerned, I am of 
the view that the appellant has to pay the amount of Diyat determined by 
the Federal Government for the current fiscal year. While holding so, I am 
guided from the dictum laid down by the Supreme Court of Pakistan “in 
the matter of Suo Motu Action Regarding Non-Payment of the 
compensation amount to the poor electrician, who has been pressurized by 
the political figure of PML(N) as well as by the police to enter into a 
compromise with the accused murderers of his 12 years old son” (2012 
SCMR 437), wherein it has been held as under:- 
“Now turning towards the proposition of amount of DIYAT, it is to 
be noted that under section 323 of P.P.C., the object and purpose 
of recovery of DIYAT amount is that the victim should be 
compensated according to the rate which is prevailing at the time 
when the compromise is effected. The learned Attorney-General for 
Pakistan as well as the learned Additional Advocate General, 
Punjab, both have agreed that the date of compromise could be 
relevant for the purpose of determining the amount of 
compensation and not the date, when the offence was committed. In 
this behalf, reference is made to Abdul Ghafoor v. State (1992 

Crl. Appeal No.234893-J of 2018 
17
SCMR 1218), Ali Sher v. State (1992 PCr.LJ 1583), Safdar Ali v. 
State (PLD 1991 Supreme Court 202), Niaz v. State (2009 PCr.LJ 
1479). However, there is a judgment of Federal Shariat Court 
reported as Ali Dost v. State (2006 PCr.LJ 80) wherein fixation of 
amount of DIYAT and payment of amount of DIYAT in instalments 
was allowed, but we are of the view that while delivering the 
judgment by the Federal Shariat Court, the judgments noted 
hereinabove, were not considered. The minimum rate of the 
compensation of DIYAT amount is to be fixed by the Court, 
according to the notification, issued by the Federal Government, 
on every financial year, therefore, we are not inclined to agree 
with the opinion expressed in the judgment of the Federal Shariat 
Court. However, following the law laid down by this Court, 
referred to hereinabove, we declare that as far as the amount of 
DIYAT is concerned, the same shall be determined according to 
the prevailing rate of DIYAT at the time when the compromise is 
effected, because it is the accused who actually requests the victim 
party to favour him and if, as a result such favour is extended then 
according to the law, the payment of compensation should be 
determined and made at the rate prevailing at the time when the 
compromise is effected and executed by the Court 
 
Therefore, the appellant is held liable to pay an amount of 
Rs.81,03,955/- (Rupees eight million one hundred three thousand nine 
hundred and fifty five only) to the legal heirs of deceased as Diyat for the 
fiscal year 2024-25 
18. 
With the above modification in the conviction and sentence of the 
appellant, his appeal is hereby dismissed.
