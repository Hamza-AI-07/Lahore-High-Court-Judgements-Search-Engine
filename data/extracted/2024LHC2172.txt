           Ch. Muhammad Iqbal, J:- Through this single judgment, 
we intend to decide the titled appeal [R.F.A. No.1630/2024] as 
well as R.F.A. No.1628/2024 and R.F.A. No.1655/2024 as 
common questions of law and facts are involved in these cases.  
2.  
Through these regular first appeals under Section 39 of 
The Arbitration Act, 1940, the appellants have challenged the 
validity of orders dated 16.10.2023 passed by the learned Civil 
Judge, Lahore who dismissed the objection petition of the 
appellants, made Award dated 09.03.2016 rule of the Court and 
modified the Award by holding that the interest at the rate of 6% 
will be calculated from the date of order/decree and not from the 
year 2014.  
3. 
Brief facts of the cases as contended by learned counsel 
for the appellants are that a gas supply agreement exists between 
the parties and Section 18.1 of the Gas Supply Agreement 
provides that any dispute between the appellant and respondent 
No.1 shall be finally determined by an arbitration in accordance 
Date of hearing

with the rules of London Court of International Arbitration 
[hereinafter referred to as “LCIA”] as well as the dispute between 
the parties regarding certain events of non-supply of gas during 
the period from 28.02.2011 to 10.05.2011. In this regard, 
respondent No.1 was liable to pay claim of the appellant 
amounting to Rs.23,96,84,090/-. The appellant instituted 
arbitration proceedings with LCIA by filing request for 
arbitration on 27.02.2014 against respondent No.1. On 
27.06.2014, LCIA notified the appellant and respondent No.1 
regarding appointment of Porf. Dr. M.S.A Wahab (respondent 
No.2) as a sole arbitrator in the arbitration proceedings. The 
arbitrator finally gave award on 09.03.2016. Respondent No.1 
filed an application on 08.06.2016 for making Award as rule of 
the Court. The appellant filed an objections to the above award 
contending therein that arbitrator lacks jurisdiction to award 
interest. The learned Civil Judge, Lahore vide judgment & decree 
16.10.2023, dismissed the objection petition of the appellant, 
modified the relief granted by the arbitrator given in clause 3 by 
holding that the interest at the rate of 6% will be calculated from 
the date of order/decree and not from the year 2014. Hence, these 
appeals. 
 
4. 
We have heard the arguments of learned counsels for the 
parties and have gone through the record. 
5. 
The main dispute between the parties is regarding the date 
of commencement of rate of interest. The arbitrator gave decision 
dated 09.03.2016 with regard to this dispute with the following 
relief: 
 “(ii) The Respondent breached the GSA and is ordered to pay 
Rs.239,684,090 in compensation to the Claimant for the loss 
suffered thereby. 
(iii) The Claimant is awarded interest at the rate of 6% per 
annum on the amount of Rs.239, 684, 090, payable as of 18 
August 2014 until the date of actual payment by the 
Respondent.” 

 
R.F.A. No.1630/2024

In these cases, the only dispute agitated by the appellants is 
regarding the modification in commencement of rate of interest 
made by the learned Civil Judge, Lahore in the judgment & 
decree dated 16.10.2023 as under: 
“…however, the 6% interest awarded by the arbitrator will 
be calculated from the date of order/decree and not from 
the year 2014.” 
The points involved in these cases can be formulated into 
following two questions: 
i. 
Whether the arbitrator was competent to award 
interest at the rate of 6% per annum on the amount of 
compensation payable as of 18.10.2014 till date of 
actual payment? 
 
ii. 
Whether the Court has jurisdiction to modify, amend 
or grant interest on award?  
Under Section 15 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, the Court has 
jurisdiction to modify, amend or correct the Award. For ready 
reference, aforesaid provision is reproduced as under: 
 “15. Power of Court to modify award. The Court may by 
order modify or correct an award— 
(a) Where it appears that a part of the award is upon a matter 
not referred to arbitration and such part can be separate 
from the other part and does not affect the decision on the 
matter referred; or 
(b) Whether the award is imperfect in form, or contains any 
obvious error which can be amended without affecting such 
decision; or 
(c) Where the award contains a clerical mistake or an error 
arising from an accidental slip or omission.” 
Under Section 29 of the Act ibid, the Court has a power to grant 
interest on the compensation, which provision reads as under: 
 “29. Interest on awards. Where and insofar as an award is 
for the payment of money the Court may in the decree order 
interest, from the date of the decree at such rate as the Court 
deems reasonable, to be paid on the principal sum as adjudged 
by the award and confirmed by the decree.” 

 
R.F.A. No.1630/2024

In the Act ibid no such provision is available which empowers 
the arbitrator to award interest on compensation amount.  
6. 
The learned counsel for the appellant argued that the 
arbitrator rightly awarded 6% interest per annum from 
18.08.2014 but in this regard, he failed to refer any provision 
from The Arbitration Act, 1940 on which basis the arbitrator was 
shown competent to award interest. The controversy regarding 
grant of interest by the arbitrator has been resolved by the 
Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in Messrs A. Z. Company’s1 
case by holding that the interest cannot be allowed on damages 
for breach of contract. It was further held that the compensation 
assessed by the arbitrator until the amount has been so 
determined there is no sum payable to the seller on which interest 
can run. For ready reference, relevant portion of the judgment 
(supra) is reproduced as under: 
       “It is true that a great number of decisions under the 
Interest Act are not easily reconcilable. But so far as grant of 
interest by way of damages is concerned there is not much 
divergence of judicial opinion. Hence in the light of the 
aforesaid decisions I am of opinion that generally in the 
absence of an express or implied contract to pay interest, or 
usage of trade, interest cannot be allowed on damages for 
breach of a contract. 
         Some arguments were advanced to show that the claim 
being for an ascertained sum, Interest Act was attracted to this 
case. The right of the seller under the agreement is to have 
compensation assessed by the Arbitrators and until the amount 
has been so determined there is no sum certain payable to the 
seller upon which interest can run. Therefore mere fact of issue 
of a debit note by the seller in respect of the claim would not 
bring the case under the Interest Act.”  
Another reliance is placed on Ghulam Abbas’s case2 wherein the 
Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has held that: 
 “18…. In M/s A. Z. Company v. M/s S. Maula Bukhsh 
Muhammad Bashir (PLD 1965 SC 505), this court has already 
                                          
1 Messrs A. Z. Company Vs. Messrs S. Maula Bukhsh Muhammad Bashir (PLD 1965 SC 
505). 
2 Ghulam Abbas Vs. Trustees of the Port of Karachi (PLD 1987 SC 393)  

 
R.F.A. No.1630/2024 
 
5
ruled that generally in the absence of express or implied 
contract to pay interest, or of usage of trade, interest cannot be 
allowed on damages for breach of contract. The compensation 
for breach of contract qua the claims accepted by the 
Arbitrator as awarded could not, therefore, be subjected to a 
further liability to pay interest according to the dictum laid 
down in the aforesaid decision. 
21….So far as the law in this country is concerned, in the case 
of A. Z. Company (Supra), this court has held that interest on 
the sum awarded as damages cannot be allowed for period 
prior to the date of award except on the grounds already 
mentioned which are not applicable in the present case……..  
it was an unliquidated claim until the passing of the award and 
in any event interest could only be awarded if there were a 
debt or sum certain payable at a certain time,  interest on a 
claim for damages arising out of breach of contract cannot be 
allowed both on principle and in law…..….In A. Z. Company 
(supra) the law is settled so far as this Court is concerned and 
we find no reason to depart from that statement of the law that 
interest in such a case cannot be allowed for period prior to 
date of award and we hold accordingly. 
22.     As far as the grant of interest from the date of the award 
until the payment of the principal sum it may be observed that 
the Arbitrator can under no circumstances award interest for 
the period beyond the passing of the decree by the Court on the 
award for the simple reason that the statutory provisions 
contained in section 29 of the Arbitration Act take over and it 
is the Court within whose discretion lies the power to order 
interest from the date of the decree at such rate as the Court 
deemed reasonable, to be paid on the principal sum as 
adjudged by the award and confirmed by the decree. From this 
it necessarily follows that future interest with effect from the 
date of the decree could not legally be awarded by the 
Arbitrator……..The 
Arbitrator, 
therefore, 
exceeded 
his 
authority, in any case, to have awarded future interest for the 
period between the date of the award and the date of the decree 
on any basis….As we have held that the Arbitrator in the facts 
of the present case could not according to law grant interest as 
claimed, there would be an error of law apparent on the face of 
the record…. 
23.     The conclusion from the foregoing discussion is that so 
far as the item of interest in dispute is concerned the Arbitrator 
committed an illegality in awarding interest except that the 
interest awarded from the date of decree onwards has been 
saved by virtue of section 29 of the Arbitration Act.” 
The Hon’ble Apex Court in Dawood Cotton Mills’ case3 has also 
held that an arbitrator has no power to grant interest on

compensation. For reference, relevant portion of the judgment 
(supra) is reproduced as under: 
“11.  After taking into consideration the respective arguments 
of the learned counsel for the parties and perusing the relevant 
provisions of the Act as well as the case-law cited by Mr. 
Dastagir we are of the opinion that the learned Single Judge 
had committed serious illegality in allowing interest to the 
respondent from the date prior to the decree as the Court did 
not have the power and authority to allow such interest in view 
of the provisions of section 29 of the Act, it will be appropriate 
to reproduce section 29 of the Act as under:-- 
“29. Interest on awards.--- Where and insofar as an 
award is for the payment of money the Court may in 
the decree order interest, from the date of the decree at 
the rate as the Court deems reasonable, to be paid on 
the principal sum as adjudged by the award and 
confirmed by the decree.” 
12.      From a bare perusal of section 29 of the Act it is crystal 
clear that it confers power/authority on the Court making the 
award rule of the Court in allowing or granting interest on the 
principal sum adjudged by the award and confirmed by the 
decree on such rate as deemed reasonable from the date of 
decree. This section does not confer power on the Court to 
grant interest prior to the date of award. It is the grant of 
interest from the date of decree which falls within the 
exclusive domain of the Court proceedings with the matter for 
making award rule of the Court in terms of section 14 of the 
Act. In the circumstances order, dated 3-3-1999 was illegal to 
the extent of granting interest before the period of award as it 
had usurped the jurisdiction/power, which vested in the 
Arbitrator. The judgment in the case of Ghulam Abbas (supra) 
is of no help to the case of the respondent as this Court 
categorically held that grant of interest prior to the date of 
award was within the domain of the Arbitrator and grant 
thereof from the date of decree was within the authority and 
power of the Court and the two forums could not act otherwise 
and if anyone of them acted contrary to the provisions of 
section 29 of the Act, the order would be an illegal order. 
13.  As the order, dated 3-3-1999 suffered from a patent 
illegality, the same could be assailed at any time as it being an 
order in illegal exercise of jurisdiction was an order coram non 
judice. 
14.   For the foregoing facts, reasons and discussion this appeal 
is found to have force. Accordingly it is allowed. Impugned 
judgment dated 12-3-2002 of learned Division Bench of the 
High Court in H.C.A. No.230 of 2001 and the order of the 
learned Single Judge, dated 3-9-2001 in Execution Application 

 
R.F.A. No.1630/2024

No.150 of 2000 are set aside and the order dated 3-3-1999 of 
the learned Single Judge making the award rule of the Court is 
modified to the extent that the respondent would be entitled to 
the mark-up the rate mentioned in the decree from the date of 
decree till the payment of the decree. Parties are left to bear 
their own costs.” 
In A. Qutubuddin’s case4 the Hon’ble Apex Court has held that: 
 “Award of Interest by the Arbitrator.- 
30.    Although, the respondent has not questioned the award of 
interest by the Arbitrator from the date of earlier award, which, 
by consent of the parties, was set aside. I would like to dilate 
upon this aspect of the matter. 
31.  An Arbitrator cannot award interest prior to date of 
decree, in the absence of any express or implied agreement 
between the parties, mercantile usage and statutory provisions 
or on equitable grounds in a proper case. Thus, award of 
interest prior to date of decree is a patent illegality appears on 
the face of award. 
32.     The fact that the Arbitrator has the power to deal with 
and decide disputes which cropped up at a point of time, would 
certainly not clothe the Arbitrator with any power, which 
neither any law confers upon him nor there is any usage of 
trade having the force of law nor is there any agreement 
between the parties conferring that power. Although, technical 
rules of procedure contained in the Code of Civil Procedure 
are not extended to Arbitration proceedings, even if, I look 
elsewhere for the power of Arbitrator to award interest 
pendente lite or prior to that. Section 34 of C.P.C., which gives 
discretion to Court to award interest from the date of suit or 
period prior to it, does not apply to arbitration proceedings. 
Likewise, the Interest Act also did not confer power on the 
Arbitrator to award interest. 
33.    The grant of interest from the date prior to award or from 
the date of award until payment of the amount due and 
payable, the Arbitrator can under no circumstances award 
interest for the period beyond the passing of the decree by the 
Court in terms of award, as under section 29 of the Act, only 
the Court and not the Arbitrator have discretion to order 
interest, from the date of the decree at such a rate as the Court 
deemed reasonable. In this view of the matter, grant of interest 
prior to date of award, in absence of an express or implied, 
statutory provisions, agreement between the parties, in the 
facts of the case, is an error of law apparent on the face of the 
award.” 
In Punjab Province’s case5, this Court has held as under:

 “11.  It is, next, contended on behalf of the department that 
the arbitrators in this case did not have the authority to award 
interest, because, the appellant had made delays in paying 
what was due to the respondent and that interest could not be 
awarded by way of damages. A reference in this behalf is 
made to clause 39 of the “Additional Condition” of the 
Contract, which is arbitrator clause. It lays down that the 
“disputes which may be referred for arbitration shall be limited 
to: 
(i) 
any question difference or objection whatsoever 
which shall arise in any way connected with or 
arising out of the contract, or/and 
(ii) 
the meaning of the operation of any part of the 
contract, or/and 
(iii) 
the rights, duties or liabilities of either party, 
or/and  
(iv) 
whether the contract should be terminated or has 
been rightly terminated and as regards the rights 
and obligations of the parties as the result of such 
termination.” 
It is submitted that the respondent’s case falls within the ambit 
of sub- clauses (i) and (ii), which cover almost any dispute that 
may arise between the parties. This, however, does not seem to 
be the intention of clause 39 which lays down that “disputes 
which may be referred for arbitration shall be limited to” what 
is contained in the four sub-clauses. My interpretation of 
clause 39 is that only such disputes can be referred to 
arbitration as arise out of or are connected with the contract. 
The arbitration clause does not give the arbitrators the 
authority to impose punishments or penalties on a party, unless 
the penalty is contemplated in the terms of the contract itself. I 
have not been shown any clause of the contract prescribing a 
penalty for late payment of unascertained amounts to the 
contractor in the shape of penal interest.   
……. 
14. Reliance is also placed on Chandras v. Isbrandtson Moller 
Co. Ltd, (3) in which it was held by the Court of appeal that it 
was an implied term of the submission that the Arbitrator 
should decide the dispute according to the existing law of 
contract which included the provisions of the Law Reforms 
(Miscellaneous Provisional Act, 1934, section 3 (1) of which 
gives a Court the power to award interest on debt or damages, 
and, therefore, the arbitrator had the power to award interest. It 
is obvious that this decision is based on the provisions of the 
Law Reforms (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931, whereas 
there is no such corresponding law in Pakistan. The question, 
whether interest could be awarded in the absence of there

being a contract between the parties or in the absence of a legal 
provision, was elaborately considered in Messrs A. Z. 
Company v. Messrs Maula Bakhsh Mohammad Bashir. It was 
held that: 
“------ so far as the grant of interest by way of damages 
is concerned, there is not much divergence of judicial 
opinion. Hence in the light of the aforesaid decisions I 
am of opinion that generally in the absence of an 
express or implied contract to pay interest or usage of 
trade, interest cannot be allowed on damages for breach 
of contract.” 
It has also been observed in the same case that: 
“Section 1 of the Contract Act does not in cases where 
interest was not already payable by law permit interest 
where the sum claimed is not a sum certain. It only 
allows interest apart from contract in cases where a sum 
certain is due and a notice has been given that interest 
will be charged.” 
There is, therefore, no warrant for the view that the arbitrators 
could award any interest in this case.” 
In Qazi Mughal Baz’s case6 it has been held that:  
“13. We have carefully considered the arguments of the 
learned counsel for the parties in the light of the record placed 
before us. It is undisputable that reference in this case was 
made to the first Arbitrator after the appellant had instituted 
this suit against respondents for recovery of the specific 
amount mentioned in the plaint. The suit, after some 
proceedings therein, was stayed by the Court so that the matter 
could be referred to an Arbitrator in accordance with the terms 
of the agreement, which was accordingly done. Before the first 
Arbitrator, the claim (Attachment 'A' to award Exh.R-1) 
pressed by the appellant was the same as mentioned in the 
body of the plaint, except the items relating to interest the 
earnest money and the security amount. The incomplete award 
made by the first Arbitrator also related to the same items 
which were mentioned in Attachment 'A', referred to above. 
After this award had been made, it was on the application, 
dated 23-12-1972, made by the appellant that the suit filed by 
him be restored that the learned Senior Civil Judge summoned 
the file of the original suit and proceeded with it and made the 
award of the first Arbitrator rule of the Court. This order of the 
learned Senior Civil Judge was however, set aside, on 9-2-
1977 by a Division Bench of this Court, in R.F.A. No. 71 of 
1973, and the case remanded to him for proceeding further in 
the matter in the light of the observations made in the remand

P.W.D., Peshawar and 2 others (1987 CLC 50)

order. While so proceeding with the suit, with a view to 
determining the part of the claim allowed wholly or in part by 
the first Arbitrator but left undetermined by him in terms of 
money, the Court, with the express consent of the parties to get 
the dispute resolved through arbitration and after obtaining 
from this lists of persons who could be considered by the 
Court for appointment as Arbitrator, appointed Mirza Maqsood 
Ahmad as Arbitrator, who submitted his award to the Court 
which was objected to by the respondents but with no success. 
The award made by Mirza Maqsood Ahmad in his own words, 
related to “outstanding points which remained undetermined 
by the previous Arbitrator”. It was accepted by the Court with 
some modifications and the rule based thereon after its merger 
with the award earlier submitted by the first Arbitrator. The 
decree passed by Court in favour of the appellant was of the 
amount not exceeding that claimed by him in the suit. We are, 
therefore, of the view that the arbitration in this case was with 
the intervention of the Court in a pending suit which had been 
filed by the appellant for recovery from the respondents of the 
amount specified in the plaint. That being so, the authority of 
both the Arbitrators to resolve the dispute extended to the 
claim and the amount which was specified in the plaint and not 
beyond that, and the decision made by the second Arbitrator 
awarding amount in excess of the suit amount, in so far as it 
related to that excess, was to be regarded as a decision without 
jurisdiction and beyond reference. The learned trial Judge, 
under section 15 of the Arbitration Act, read with section 25 
thereof, had the jurisdiction to modify the award made by the 
Arbitrator, and the modifications made by him so that the 
awarded amount coincided with the amount claimed by the 
appellant in the suit could not, therefore, be taken exception to.  
14.     In regard to the interest allowed by the second 
Arbitrator, suffice it to say that there is nothing on the record 
to show that this point was specifically referred to Mirza 
Maqsood Ahmad for arbitration. The award made by him 
clearly shows that he was conscious of the points in dispute 
which were referred to the first Arbitrator and also the order of 
this Court passed in R.F.A. No.71 of 1973. He has mentioned 
these facts in his award and has given decision in respect of 
outstanding points. That being so, his award relating to interest 
was without jurisdiction. The case, therefore, fell to be 
governed by section 29 of the Arbitration Act and the learned 
trial Judge was right in modifying the award in regard to this 
item in the manner he did.” 
In Ch. Muhammad Sharif’s case7 it has been held that: 
“Claim No. 4.

The arbitrator awarded a sum of Rs.1,11,838.24 as 
compensation at the rate of 14% per annum on Rs.79,884.53 
found due on claim No.1 from 1st of August, 1971 to 31st of 
May, 1981. The learned Civil Judge has held that the 
compensation was in the nature of interest and the arbitrator in 
the absence of any enabling provision in the agreement was 
not competent to allow the same. Learned counsel for the 
appellant has contended that interest was impliedly included in 
the dispute referred to the arbitrator. He has cited Lal Chand 
Roy v. Nerode Kanta Goswamy AIR 1966 Cal. 478. This 
authority is of no avail to him as it deals with an agreement 
which was in a sufficiently wide form and the arbitrator had 
been given power to adjudicate upon all disputes between the 
parties and to adjust all equities. In this case, however, it is 
admitted that the agreement between the parties does not 
envisage payment of compensation on the amount found due 
from the respondent. Learned counsel for the respondent has 
supported the finding of the learned trial Court on this claim. 
He has cited Punjab Province v. Zafar Iqbal Cheema 1983 
CLC 513, Messrs Sheikh Hussain Bux and Co. v. Messrs Zaib 
Tun Textile Mills Ltd. PLD 1981 Kar. 28 and Qazi Mughal 
Baz v. The N.-W.F.P. through the Provincial Government 
through Secretary, P.W.D. Peshawar and 2 others 1987 CLC 
50 according to which arbitrator has no power to award 
interest or impose penalty on the amount unless the same is 
contemplated in the terms of the contract itself and specifically 
referred to arbitration. Therefore, the finding of the learned 
trial Court on this claim is unexceptionable.” 
Further reliance is placed on The Federation of Pakistan’s8 case 
wherein it has been held that: 
 “11.   It is well-settled that mere absence of objection per se 
does not absolve the Court of its primary responsibility of 
deciding whether the award was valid on the face of it. It is 
equally recognized principle of law that where a dispute is 
referred to an arbitrator of the choice of the parties and he 
makes an award, it becomes the duty of the Court to give every 
reasonable intendment in favour of the award and lean towards 
upholding it rather than vitiating it. It may not be out of 
context to reproduce the dictum of Koy, L. J., 1 In Re: 
Heihley, Maxsted & Co. and Durant & Co., (1893) 1 Q B 405: 
“The Courts have already been exceedingly cautious in 
dealing with awards. Prima facie, an award is final and 
not subject to appeal; the arbitrator is chosen by the 
parties who presumably prefer a domestic tribunal which

mistake of law or fact is not, per se, a ground for sending 
back the award of such a Tribunal.” 
14.   Adverting to the second ground of attack, it may be 
observed that section 29 of the Arbitration Act providing for 
award of interest on payment of the amount due reads as 
under:-- 
S. 29. Interest on award.---Where and in so far as an 
award is for the payment of money the Court may in the 
decree order interest, from the date of the decree at such 
rate as the Court deems reasonable, adjudged by the 
award and confirmed by the decree. 
15.   Learned counsel did not dispute the authority of the Court 
to award interest on an award for the payment of money from 
the date of decree as the Court deems reasonable but he 
vigorously contended that in the absence of any clause in the 
contract between the Contractor and the Employer, arbitrator 
appointed by the parties does not possess any authority to grant 
interest. For this proposition, he referred to the following 
cases: 
(a) Plaintiffs v. Sole Arbitrator etc. (NLR 1992 CLJ 321), 
(b) Dr. Mahmoodur Rehman v. Secretary, Ministry of 
Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs (PLD 1992 FSC 
153), and 
(c) Ghulam Abbas v. Trustees of the Port of Karachi 
(PLD 1987 SC 393). 
16.  This argument was also raised before the learned Single 
Judge and the case of Ghulam Abbas was cited before him, but 
the objection raised was that the arbitrator could not have 
awarded interest on uncertained amount. Contention was 
repelled by the learned Single Judge by observing that in the 
statement of claim respondents had claimed a total amount of 
Rs.14,38,075.38 as due and payable by the appellants. Learned 
Single Judge found that this amount had been wrongfully 
withheld by the appellants as ascertained by the arbitrator who 
had awarded interest from the date of award of contract till the 
date of award which was not open to exception. 
17. In the case reported in NLR 1992 CLJ 321, a learned 
Single Judge of this Court held that Arbitrator is not 
empowered to award interest against one party or other unless 
there is an agreement to that effect between the parties. 
18.  The case reported as Dr. Mahmoodur Rehman is famous 
authority by the Federal Shariat Court relating to Riba 
(interest) founded on 115 Shariat Petitions and three (3) suo 
motu notice cases which is presently sub judice before the 
Shariat Appellate Bench of the apex Court and lays down the 
guidelines for regulating the award of interest and the express

prohibitions in Islam. This judgment in our view is not 
operative as contemplated by proviso to Article 203-D of the 
Constitution because of pendency of appeal enforce the 
Supreme Court. 
19. The question of grant of interest by arbitrator, however, 
received attention in the case of Ghulam Abbas (supra). In this 
judgment a Full Bench of the Supreme Court observed that the 
mere fact that pleadings were before the arbitrator and issues 
were then settled on the pleadings of the parties incorporating 
the question of interest does not necessarily give rise to the 
inference that the parties had agreed to refer specifically the 
question of grant of interest as a question of law for the 
decision of the arbitrator, so as to preclude any party to the 
arbitration from challenging the award on the ground of error 
of law on the face of the award. Supreme Court observed that 
the real import the section 29 of the Arbitration Act whereby 
power has been conferred on the Court to order payment of 
interest while making the award the rule of the Court, if the 
same is for payment of money this interest covers the post-
decree period on the principal sum in the award. Their 
Lordships further clarified that by its own terms, this section 
does not contemplate or create any embargo on the power of 
the arbitrator to award interest in adjudicating upon the 
reference before him. While laying down that right to interest 
for the period prior to the date of suit or prior to the reference 
to arbitration was a matter of substantive law, as contrasted 
with the power given to a Court of law under section 34, 
C.P.C. or section 29 of the Arbitration Act which is a statutory 
power within the domain of procedural law, apex Court 
observed that the right to interest for the period prior to the suit 
arises in one of the four following ways: 
(i) Agreement, express or implied between the parties. 
(ii) mercantile usage, 
(iii) statutory provisions, 
(iv) interest may be also allowed on equitable grounds in 
proper cases. 
20.  Supreme Court cited with approval the following extract 
from the Privy Council case reported as Bengal Nagpur 
Railways Co v. Ruttanji Ramji and others (AIR 1938 PC 67): 
“.....The crucial question, however, is whether the 
Court has authority to allow interest for the period 
prior to the institution of the suit; and the solution of 
this question depends, not upon the Civil Procedure 
Code, but upon substantive law. Now, interest for 
the period prior to the date of the suit may be 
awarded, if there is an agreement for the payment of 
interest at a fixed rate, or it is payable by the usage

of trade having the force of law, or under the 
provision of any substantive law entitling the 
plaintiff to recover interest as for instance, under 
section 80, Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, the 
Court may award interest at the rate of 6 per cent. 
per annum, when no rate of interest is specified in 
the promissory note or bill of exchange.....” 
21. As in the case before the Supreme Court, plaintiff/ 
contractor had claimed interest by way of compensation for 
wrongful retention of moneys due to the plaintiff which 
amount was unascertained and claimed by way of unliquidated 
damages reaffirming its earlier view in M/s. A.Z. Company v. 
M/s. Maula Bukhsh Muhammad Bashir (PLD 1965 SC 505), it 
was held that compensation for breach of contract could not be 
awarded by the Arbitrator. Furthermore, it was observed that 
even on the assumption that interest was recoverable as 
damages for wrongful detention of money since the claim of 
the appellant was disputed and required to be determined by 
adjudication in the arbitration proceedings, it was an 
unliquidated claim until the passing of the award. In any event 
interest could only be awarded if there were a debt or sum 
certain payable at a certain time. Supreme Court observed that 
interest on a claim for damages arising out of breach of 
contract could be allowed both on principle and in law. 
Dealing with the question whether Arbitrator was competent to 
award interest in the circumstances of the case and whether in 
having awarded interest he committed an error of law apparent 
on the face of the award, the Supreme Court held that the 
general rule of law is that an award is final as to both fact and 
law but there is an exception to the rule namely that an error of 
law apparent on the face of award is ground for setting it aside. 
There is a further rider to this rule namely that if the parties 
have specifically referred a question of law to arbitration then 
the general rule would apply and the award will be beyond 
reproach even if such a question is decided erroneously. It may 
also be pertinent to refer to another important principle of law 
laid down in the judgment that as a general principle, the 
Arbitrator has always been considered to have implied 
authority to follow the ordinary rules of law.” 
This Court in Province of Punjab’s9 case has reiterated this view 
by holding that: 
 “6. For the submission about the charge of the interest is 
concerned, obviously, notwithstanding the absence of the 
objections the Court below was duty bound to see, whether the 
interest has been lawfully granted by the arbitrator or 
otherwise, I am not convinced, that in the agreement there is

Works Department Vs. Awan Engineering Enterprises (2006 YLR 881)

any such clause, which permits the arbitrator grant interest 
upon the amount of security. Though, Mr. Muhammad Shahid 
Piracha, Advocate, submits it to be otherwise, but when 
specifically questioned, he had not been able to pinpoint any 
clause of the nature, under which the arbitrator was permitted 
to grant the interest or even this could be done under any law, 
therefore, it is held that the arbitrator had no power to award to 
grant any interest, on the amount due, to a claimant. 
Resultantly, the award to the extent of Rs.27,6000, granted 
interest to the respondent cannot be sustained. To this extent, it 
is modified, and by excluding such amount, the remaining 
award is directed to be made rule of the Court, and decree in 
pursuance thereof be passed.” 
The Supreme Court of India in State of Orissa’s case10 has held 
that: 
“13. It is now well-settled that the interest pendente lite is not a 
matter within the jurisdiction of the arbitrator. In this 
connection reference may be made to the observations of this 
Court in Executive Engineer (Irrigation), Balimela v. 
Abhaduta Jena (1988) 1 SCC 418; (AIR 1988 SC 1520) where 
this Court held that the arbitrator could not grant interest 
pendente lite. In the aforesaid view of the matter this direction 
in the award for the payment of such interest must be deleted 
from the award. So, we delete the following portion from the 
award—“The award amount shall bear interest at 10% per 
annum from 9-9-1975 till the date of decree or payment, which 
is earlier.” The order of the High Court is modified to the 
extent that the award is confirmed subject to deletion of the 
interest as aforesaid. We make it clear that in the facts of this 
case interest for the period from 26-9-1981 to 18-3-1983, the 
date of the award be deleted. The High Court has, however, 
granted interest from the date of the decree. That is sustained.” 
 
 
For what has been discussed above, the questions 
formulated by this Court are answered as under: 
  
Q.I. Whether the arbitrator was competent to award 
interest at the rate of 6% per annum on the amount of 
compensation payable as of 18.10.2014 till date of actual 
payment? 
 
Ans. No. The arbitrator has no such power or authority in 
the law to award interest on the amount of compensation rather

only the Court is competent to do so and that only grant interest 
from the date of order/decree. 
  
Q.II Whether the Court has jurisdiction to modify, amend 
or grant interest on award?  
 
Ans. Yes. The Court is fully competent to modify, amend 
or grant interest on award.  
 
As per Section 29 as well as dictum laid down by the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan as mentioned above, the 
order of the arbitrator in respect of award of interest to the 
appellant is without jurisdiction. It is settled law that arbitrator 
has no power, authority to grant interest on the amount of 
damages/compensation from the year 2014 till realization. This 
power is only with the Court under Section 29 and the interest 
should be granted if court desires from the date of order or 
decree. The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan observed as 
mentioned above that generally in the absence of express or 
implied contract to pay interest, interest cannot be allowed on 
damages for breach of contract. Arbitrator could not award the 
interest of his own on the amount of compensation. Moreover, 
the interest and sum of award as damages cannot be allowed for 
period prior to the date of award under Section 29 and the court is 
empowered/competent to allow interest of award from the date of 
decree till payment, as such the trial court rightly modified the 
order in respect of interest awarded by the arbitrator, as such the 
order of arbitrator in respect of interest is without jurisdiction.         
7. 
Learned counsel for the appellants has not pointed out any 
illegality or material irregularity in the impugned judgment & 
decree of the trial Court, which does not call for any interference 
by this Court in its appellate jurisdiction.
