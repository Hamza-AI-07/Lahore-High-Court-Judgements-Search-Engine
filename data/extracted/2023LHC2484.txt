6. 
Arguments advanced pro and contra have been heard. Available 
record perused. 
7. 
It has been noticed that petitioner being injured got registered case 
vide FIR No.435/2022 (mentioned above); his medicolegal examination 
certificate is available at pages No.8 to 13 of instant petition as                 
Annex “B” and perusal of the same reveals that seven (07) injuries were 
noted by the 1st Medical Examiner at the time of his medical examination; 
detail of the same is hereby scanned below:-  
 
1st Medical Examiner declared injuries No.2, 4 & 5 as “Jurh Ghayr Jaifah 
Damiyah”, injury No.7 as falling under Section: 337 L(2) whereas kept 
injuries No.1, 3 & 6 under observation; after receipt of X-ray report 
wherein fracture involving head of proximal of 2nd toe of left foot was 
noted, he declared injury No.6 as “Jurh Ghayr Jaifah Hashimah” whereas 
injury No.1 & 3 as falling under Section: 337 L(2) P.P.C.; opinion of 

                     
 
 
specialist/operation notes/X-ray report mentioned in the medicolegal 
examination certificate is hereby reproduced:- 
 
“Opinion of Specialist/Operation Notes/X-Ray Report: 
Vide x-ray report 9603-05-06 dated 29-10-2022 fracture involving 
head of proximal of 2nd toe is noted in x-rays of left foot. No bony 
injury evident in x-rays of skull and left hand.” 
 
It is relevant to mention here that 1st Medical Examiner mentioned that 
there was no possibility of any fabrication and relevant portion of the 
report, in this regard, is also hereby reproduced:- 
“Possibility of Fabrication if any: Yes/No: 
No.”  
It is also noteworthy here that as per injury statement of present 
petitioner prepared by the police (copy whereof is available at page #14 
of instant petition), seven (07) injuries were noted by the police official 
and at Sr. No.6, pain on left foot was also noted and relevant portion of 
said injury statement is hereby scanned below:- 
 
 
Aforementioned state of affairs reflects that injury on left foot was 
declared as “Jurh Ghayr Jaifah Hashimah” after receipt of X-ray report.  
On Court’s query, learned Assistant Advocate General, Punjab after 
perusing the record (produced by police official mentioned above) 
apprises that in the application moved by Attiq-ur-Rehman (now arrayed 
as respondent No.6 in the petition) for constitution of District Standing 
Medical Board, opinion of Radiologist/X-ray report was not challenged; 
perusal of report of District Standing Medical Board (copy whereof is 
available at pages No.15, 16 of instant petition as Annex “C”) reveals that 
District Standing Medical Board obtained X-rays No.10546 to 10549 
from Radiologist of District Headquarter Hospital, Okara City wherein 

                     
 
 
fracture through head of proximal phalanx of 2nd toe of left foot was noted 
and relevant portion from said report, in this regard, is reproduced:-  
“According to Radiologist DHQ Hospital Okara City, vide X-ray 
No.10546 to 10549 dated 23-11-2022, “Fracture through head of 
proximal phalanx of 2nd toe noted in x-rays of left foot.” 
 
Perusal of aforementioned opinion of Radiologist reveals that chance of 
any fabrication regarding said injury/fracture was not observed by said 
Radiologist, however, District Standing Medical Board opined that 
possibility of fabrication regarding said injury No.6 is “Yes” on the 
ground that small bone was fractured and it was easy to fracture and 
relevant portion of the report, in this regard, is hereby reproduced:- 
 
“CONCLUSION/OPINION OF THE MEDICAL BOARD  
“The District Standing Medical Board is of the opinion that 
possibility of fabrication injury No.(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(7) “No” whereas 
injury No.(6) possibility of fabrication is “Yes” Because, 
 
. Small bone fracture, 
 
.  Easy to fracture. 
 
When all the aforementioned factors are taken into consideration in 
totality, then it has been noticed that when injury on the left foot was very 
much observed and noted by the police official at the time of preparing 
injury statement of the petitioner, same was also noted by the 1st Medical 
Examiner, which was confirmed as having fracture noted by the 
Radiologist vide  X-ray report No.9603-04-05-06 dated:29-10-2022 and 
chance of any fabrication regarding said fracture was not noted by said 
Radiologist, on the basis of same, 1st Medical Officer declared nature of 
said injury and also mentioned that there was no chance of any 
fabrication, opinion of said Radiologist was not specifically challenged 
when application was moved by Attiq-ur-Rehman (now arrayed as 
respondent No.6) for constitution of District Standing Medical Board, 
Radiologist of District Headquarter Hospital, Okara City, when asked by 
District Standing Medical Board, issued X-ray report in which 
aforementioned fracture was again noted/confirmed and it was not 
mentioned even in said report that there was any chance of fabrication 
regarding said injury and District Standing Medical Board did not 
mention any reservation regarding genuineness/accuracy of opinion of 1st 
Radiologist as well as opinion of 2nd Radiologist and even did not refer 

                     
 
 
present petitioner to any other Radiologist, then while ignoring the said 
consistent X-ray/Radiologist reports, observing possibility of fabrication as 
“Yes” by District Standing Medical Board merely on the basis that small 
bone was fractured and it was easy to fracture requires re-assessment by the 
Provincial Standing Medical Board through re-examination (medical) of the 
injured because if opinion of District Standing Medical Board based on 
aforementioned reasons only is accepted, then in future if some small bone 
will be fractured or if any bone will be fractured which is easy to fracture, 
then it will be straightway observed that there is possibility of fabrication, 
which would be against the spirit of medical jurisprudence. Therefore, in 
peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, re-examination (medical) of 
petitioner/injured through Provincial Standing Medical Board is quite 
necessary for safe administration of justice but said aspect has been ignored 
and not taken into consideration at the time of passing impugned order 
dated:09.01.2023 by Area Magistrate whereby application filed by present 
petitioner for constitution of Provincial Standing Medical Board has been 
dismissed, hence, impugned order (mentioned above) is against the settled 
principles of law on the subject as well as facts of the case, thus, same is not 
sustainable in the eyes of law and is hereby set aside, application filed by the 
petitioner for constitution of Provincial Standing Medical Board is 
allowed/accepted and as a consequence whereof it is hereby ordered that 
Munir Ahmad (petitioner) shall be medically re-examined by the Provincial 
Standing Medical Board in accordance with law expeditiously/without loss 
of further time.  Learned Assistant Advocate General, Punjab shall 
communicate this order to the concerned quarters for compliance. Petition 
Allowed.
