29.04.2024 Mr. Shahrukh Zaman Baloch, Advocate for the petitioner. 
Mr. Zafar Iqbal Soomro, Deputy District Public  
Prosecutor on Court’s Call. 
 
            Through this petition filed under section 526 of Cr.P.C., 
petitioner seeks transfer of trial of a criminal case titled “The State 
versus Mehmood, etc.” in FIR No. 33 dated 30.01.2023, registered 
under Sections 324/336/109-PPC, at Police Station Saddar Chishtian, 
District Bahawalnagar, from the Court of Mr. Muhammad Asif Gill, 
learned Magistrate Section-30 Chishtian, to any other Court of 
competent jurisdiction, at District Headquarter Bahawalnagar.  
2. 
It was argued by learned counsel for the petitioner that the 
learned Judicial Officer being connived with the complainant has 
geared up the process of recording of evidence without fulfilling the 
requirement of fair trial and due process which is reflected from the 
fact that even in the days of strike, he has recorded the statement of 
two witnesses and is in a hurry to convict the petitioner. Further stated 
that the Judicial Officer and the learned counsel for the complainant 
belong to the same caste and the petitioner being accused of the case 
does not expect fair trial due to biasness of the learned Judge. 
3. 
Heard. Record perused. 
4. 
The apprehension of the petitioner about not expecting fair 
trial on the face of it is not well founded because being caste fellow 
or from the same brotherhood by a counsel does not mean that the 
Judicial Officer would lean in favour of the complainant side as 
otherwise case is decided on the basis of evidential record and 
material produced by the parties, whereas in order to avert delayed 
justice expeditious trial is the requirement of law. It is further 

                    Crl. Misc. 10-T of 2024

observed that petitioner has also filed another application bearing 
No.11-T of 2024 for transfer of case FIR No.325 dated 17.07.2022 
registered under sections 324/337F(v)/34 PPC at Police Station 
Saddar Chishtian, District Bahawalnagar lodged by a separate 
complainant wherein grounds for transfer are almost identical which 
shows the intention of petitioner to overawe the Judicial Officer.  On 
one hand, Judicial Officers are expected to be fair and impartial and 
on the other hand, it cannot be allowed that they may be subjected to 
undue harassment by way of moving such baseless applications 
seeking transfer of the cases. As observed above, the outlined grounds 
in the petition for seeking transfer of the above case mainly roam 
around the apprehension of unfair treatment due to expected biasness; 
therefore, it is essential to see the legal value of apprehension in such 
situation and the concept of biasness.  
 
5. 
It is trite that mere apprehension in the mind of a party about 
injustice at the hands of presiding officer is no ground for transfer of 
a case. In a case reported as “MUHAMMAD NAWAZ Versus 
GHULAM KADIR AND 3 OTHERS” (PLD 1973 Supreme Court 
327), Supreme Court of Pakistan has dilated upon different principles 
ought to govern the disposal of transfer applications of the present 
kind which have been spelt out by the judgments of Superior Courts 
from time to time. Following judgments are referred in the above cited 
case.

and Supreme Court while focusing on the reasonableness of 
‘apprehension’ endorsed the observations given in “Rahim Bakhsh v. 
Khalilur Rehman” (P L D 1971 Lah 517) supra, which are as follows; 
 
“What is a reasonable apprehension must be decided in each case with 
reference to the incidents and the surrounding circumstances; and the 
Court must endeavour, as far as possible, to place itself in the position 
of the applicant seeking transfer, and look at the matter from his point 
of view, having due regard to his state of mind and the degree of 
Intelligence possessed by him. Nevertheless, it is not every incident 
regarded as unfavourable by the applicant, which would justify the 
transfer of the case. The test of reasonableness of the apprehension must 
be satisfied, namely, that the apprehension must be such as a reasonable 
man might justifiably be expected to have.” 
 
In another case reported as “DAUD IQBAL PERVAIZ and another 
versus THE STATE” (PLD 1990 Supreme Court 705),                
the Supreme Court again while referring Rahim Bakhsh v. Khalilur 
Rehman (P L D 1971 Lah 517) supra focused on the reasonableness 
of apprehension and held as under; 
In case the submission of the learned counsel is accepted then in each 
and every case of sensational kind, where the people of the, locality 
become agitated and get aroused by the nature of the occurrence, no trial 
will be possible in a Court of the district where the occurrence has taken 
place, only because of the initial wave of the indignation felt by the local 
populace and the attempt of the authorities to see that the accused persons 
are arrayed before the Court of law as soon as possible. The acceptance 
of such a principle would indeed be fraught with danger and mischief 
The safeguard for the accused is that the Court should carefully weigh 
whether the apprehension being expressed is really such as a "reasonable 
man" might justifiably be expected to have in the facts and circumstances 
of the case; if so, it should transfer the case, but, if not, let the case 
proceed where it is to be tried normally.” 
  
Thus, mere apprehension in the mind of party is no ground to order 
for transfer of case unless it is supported by any material or the 
circumstances. In a case reported as “Aqa Syed ASGHAR HUSSAIN 
Versus THE STATE” (1968 SCMR 381), Supreme Court says as 
under; 
“In a case of this nature this Court ordinarily does not interfere with the 
order of the High Court. The petitioner's case is solely based on his oral 
allegation. The Court before accepting it must be fully satisfied that his 
statement is so strongly corroborated by other circumstances that no 
reasonable person could possibly doubt its correctness. In the absence 
of any such corroboration the learned Single Judge was justified in 
refusing to accept the oral allegation of the accused” 
 
6.    Supreme Court of Pakistan in another case reported as 
“MUHAMMAD ARSHAD versus THE STATE” (1997 SCMR 949), 

                    Crl. Misc. 10-T of 2024 
 
                         
 
 
 4 
 
has held that mere on the basis of ‘apprehension’ case cannot be 
transferred; factually it was in following terms;  
“The fact that the deceased is a brother of the Senior Judge of the High 
Court, does not lead to the conclusion that the learned trial Judge is 
overawed by this situation. Merely because of this relationship, 
presumption cannot be drawn that the learned trial Judge ~is prejudiced 
against the petitioner. In order to make out a case for transfer, clear and 
cogent averment should be made which may lead to the conclusion that 
the conduct of the learned trial Judge is not proper and is prejudiced. 
The transfer will be justified if there is a reasonable apprehension in the 
mind of a party that the Court would not be able to act fairly and 
impartially in the matter. Such impression should not be based on 
apprehensions or presumptions but should be substantiated with facts 
which tarnished the impartiality of the Court. The principles for 
governing disposal of transfer application are set out in Muhammad 
Nawaz v. Ghulam Kadir and others (PLD 1973 Supreme Court 327).” 
 
Similarly, in a case reported as “SARDAR KHAN and others Versus 
MUHAMMAD AFZAL and others” (2013 PSC Criminal 22), 
Supreme Court of Pakistan has declined the request for transfer of 
case which was sought on the ground that a senior lawyer of a bar was 
murdered and no counsel from that district was ready to accept brief 
of the accused.  
 
7.          Bias of a judge can be projected or highlighted through petition 
for seeking transfer of case, if it is ascertained from his action or from 
any other material on the record. Supreme Court of Pakistan while 
dealing with application for transfer of case highlighted different 
situations as examples of bias for disqualification of judge to hear the 
case and held that if bias is based on pecuniary or proprietary interest, 
small the interest may be, it operates as a disqualification but mere 
suspicion of bias, even it is not unreasonable, is not sufficient to 
render decision void. Case reported as “Ms. BENAZIR BHUTTO 
versus THE PRESIDENT OF PAKISTAN and another” (1992 SCMR 
140) is referred in this respect.  
 
         The Supreme Court of India in a case reported as, “MANAK 
LAL, Advocate Versus DR. PREM CHAND SINGHVI and others” 
(PLD 1957 Supreme Court (Ind.) 346), observed that in dealing 
with cases of bias attributed to members constituting tribunals, it is 
necessary to make a distinction between pecuniary interest and 
prejudice so attributed. It is obvious that pecuniary interest however 
small it may be in a subject-matter of the proceedings, would wholly 

                    Crl. Misc. 10-T of 2024 
 
                         
 
 
 5 
 
disqualify a member from acting as a Judge. But where pecuniary 
interest is not attributed but instead a bias is suggested, it often 
becomes necessary to consider whether there is a reasonable ground 
for assuming the possibility of a bias and whether it is likely to 
produce in the minds of the litigant or the public at large a reasonable 
doubt about the fairness of the administration of justice, it would 
always be a question of fact to be decided in each case. Supreme Court 
focused on the relevant principle as under; 
“The principle, says Halsbury, nemo debt esse judex in causa propria 
sua, precludes a justice who is interested in the subject-matter of a 
dispute, from acting as a justice therein". (Halsbury's Laws of England 
Vol. XXI, p. 535 para. 952). In our opinion, there is and can be no doubt 
about the validity of this principle and we are prepared to assume that 
this principle applies not only to the justices as mentioned by Halsbury 
but to all tribunals and bodies which are given jurisdiction to determine 
judicially the rights of parties” 
          Likewise, Federal Court of Pakistan in an elaborated judgment 
reported as “ANWAR and another versus THE CROWN” (PLD 1955 
Federal Court 185) has given a detailed expression of bias; one of 
kinds as arising from bribery was referred in above judgment in 
following terms; 
 
As regards the bias arising from bribery, reference may usefully be made 
to' Lord Bacon's impeachment before the House of Lords. Though judicial 
bribery was rampant in the England of Bacon's times, the practice was 
pronounced as most culpable and disgraceful. In one of his vigorous 
sermons Hugh Latimer thus denounced this vice: 
 
“I am sure this is scala inferni, the right way to hell, to be covetous, to 
take bribes, and pervert justice. If a Judge should ask me the way to hell. 
I would show him this way. First, let him be a covetous man; let his heart 
be poisoned with covetousness. Then let him go a little farther, and take 
bribes; and, lastly, pervert judgment: Lo, there is the mother, and the 
daughter, and the daughter's daughter. Avarice is the mother; she brings 
forth bribe-taking, and bribe-taking perverting of judgment. There lacks a 
fourth thing to make up the mess, which, so help me God, if I were a 
Judge, should be hangum tuum, a Tyburn tipped to take with' him; and it 
were the Judge of the King's Bench my Lord Chief Justice of England, 
yea, and it were my Lord Chancellor himself, to Tyburn with him.  He 
that took the silver basin and ewer for a bribe, thinketh that it will never 
come out. But he may now know that I know it, and I know it not alone; 
there be more beside me that know it. Oh, briber and bribery! He was 
never a good man that will so take bribes. It will never be merry in 
England till we have the skins of such'.  
 
Bias of a magistrate or judge can also be gauged from the fact that he 
has not allowed the prosecutor to conduct trial and himself took the 
position as prosecutor, then whole trial stands vitiated as held in 
“Adan Haji Jama and others v. The King” (1948 A C 225), which 

                    Crl. Misc. 10-T of 2024

has been referred in above cited reported case “ANWAR and another 
versus THE CROWN” (PLD 1955 Federal Court 185). 
 
8.      As cited above, Halsbury says that the principle, “nemo debt 
esse judex in causa propria sua” precludes a justice who is interested 
in the subject-matter of a dispute, from acting as a justice therein". 1   
It is the principle of Natural Justice. According to this maxim, the 
authority giving decision must be composed of impartial persons and  
should act fairly, without prejudice and bias. This principle also gets 
light from a case of UK Court reported in Pakistan as “TERRANCE 
WILLIAMS Versus PENNSYLVANIA” (2016 SCMR 1561), in following 
terms; 
At common law, a fair tribunal meant that "no man shall be a judge in his 
own case." 1 E. Coke, Institutes of the Laws of England §212, *141a 
("[A]liquis non debet esse judex in propiâ causâ"). That common-law 
conception of a fair tribunal was a narrow one. A judge could not decide 
a case in which he had a direct and personal financial stake. For example, 
a judge could not reap the fine paid by a defendant. See, e.g., Dr. 
Bonham's Case, 8 Co. Rep. 107a, 114a, 118a, 77 Eng. Rep. 638, 647, 652 
(C. P. 1610) (opining that a panel of adjudicators could not all at once 
serve as "judges to give sentence or judgment; ministers to make 
summons; and parties to have the moiety of the forfeiture"). Nor could he 
adjudicate a case in which he was a party. See, e.g., Earl of Derby's Case, 
12 Co. Rep. 114, 77 Eng. Rep. 1390 (K. B. 1614). But mere bias-without 
any financial stake in a case-was not grounds for disqualification. The 
biases of judges "cannot be challenged," according to Blackstone, "[f]or 
the law will not suppose a possibility of bias or favour in a judge, who is 
already sworn to administer impartial justice, and whose authority greatly 
depends upon that presumption and idea." 3 W. Blackstone, 
Commentaries on the Laws of England, 361 (1768) (Blackstone); see also, 
e.g., Brookes v. Earl of Rivers, Hardres 503, 145 Eng. Rep. 569 (Exch. 
1668) (deciding that a judge's "favour shall not be presumed" merely 
because his brother-in-law was involved). 
 
9.     Similar principle is in vogue in our jurisdiction as embodied in 
section 556 of Cr.P.C which is reproduced as under; 
556. Case in which Judge or Magistrate is personally interested: No 
Judge or Magistrate shall, except with the permission of the Court to 
which an appeal lies from his Court, try any case to or in which he is a 
party, or personally interested, and no Judge or Magistrate shall hear an 
appeal from any judgment or order passed or made by himself.  
 
Explanation: A Judge or Magistrate shall not be deemed a party, or 
personally interested, within the meaning of this section, to or in any 
case by reason only that he is a Municipal Commissioner or otherwise 
concerned-therein in a public capacity, or by reason only that he has 
viewed the place in which an offence is alleged to have been committed, 
or any other place in which any other transaction material to the case is 
alleged to have occurred, and made an inquiry in connection with the 
case.

Illustration 
 
A, as Collector, upon consideration of information furnished to him 
directs the prosecution of S for a breach of the Excise Laws. A is 
disqualified, from trying this case as a Magistrate. 
 
Magistrate or Judge however, shall not be considered as party or 
personally interested if the situation is like one mentioned in the 
explanation attached to above section. In a case reported as “ISLAMIC 
REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN THROUGH SECRETARY, MINISTRY OF 
INTERIOR AND KASHMIR AFFAIRS, ISLAMABAD versus ABDUL 
WALI KHAN, M. N. A., FORMER PRESIDENT OF DEFUNCT 
NATIONAL AWAMI PARTY” (P L D 1976 Supreme Court 57), when 
an objection was raised about sitting of two honourable judges in the 
bench on the basis of personal bias, collected from the facts that one 
honourable judge before his elevation was a Secretary in the Ministry of 
Law and Parliamentary Affairs, Government of Pakistan, he might have, 
in that capacity, had occasion to deal with the question of the banning of 
the National Awami Party at some stage or the other, but Supreme Court 
rejected such objection with the observation that the examination of the 
question of the banning of the Party was done mainly by the Ministry of 
Interior, Government of Pakistan and not the Ministry of Law. Similarly, 
allegation against other honourable judge was that since he has already 
dealt with the question of the continuance of the detention of Mr. Abdul 
Wali Khan and some other leaders of the National Awami Party as 
Chairman of the Advisory Board, constituted under clause (iv) of 8 
Article 10 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, 
he has already dealt with the bulk of the material which forms the basis 
for the banning of the Party as well and, therefore, he must be held to 
have made up his mind one way or the other and thus disqualified 
himself from sitting on the Bench. It was responded by the Supreme 
Court that it cannot be treated as a sufficient ground for disqualifying 
the judge and observed as follows; 
 
“As pointed out by the learned editors of American jurisprudence even 
"at common law bias or prejudice on the part of a Judge, not the result of 
interest or relationship, is not supposed to exist, and generally it does not 
incapacitate or disqualify a Judge to try a case, unless the Constitution or 
statute so provides"-(vide American Jurisprudence, Vol. 30, page 774, 
paragraph 74). 
 

                    Crl. Misc. 10-T of 2024 
 
                         
 
 
 8 
 
The basis of the disqualification, therefore, is "personal bias or 
prejudice" of such a nature as would necessarily render a Judge unable 
to exercise his functions impartially in a particular case, and this must 
be shown as a matter of fact and not merely as a matter of opinion. In 
the absence of any constitutional or statutory bar a Judge is not 
disqualified from sitting at a trial of a person merely because previously 
he had participated in other legal proceedings against the same person, 
whether in the capacity of a Judge or of an Administrative Tribunal or 
official, it makes no difference. There is abundant authority from the 
American Jurisdiction to support tire view that the mere fact that a Judge 
has dealt with another matter concerning the same person in another 
capacity does not necessarily disqualify him from sitting as a Judge at 
the trial of that person.” 
 
The Supreme Court has finally regarded such types of objections as 
baseless while holding in following terms; 
To accede to such a plea of bias would lead to very fantastic results, for, 
then even a Judge who may have refused to grant ad interim bail or 
injunction in a pending cause or appeal would find himself disqualified 
from hearing the appeal. Similarly, a judge who may have given a 
decision in one matter against a particular person in one capacity would 
be disqualified from being a Judge in any other matter in which the same 
person is a party for ever. This is clearly not the law and it could never 
have been the intention of the law to impute such universal bias to 
Judges. 
 
10.     In “TERRANCE WILLIAMS Versus PENNSYLVANIA” (2016 
SCMR 1561) cited above, it is referred that in America, National and 
State legislatures enacted statutes and constitutional provisions that 
diverged from the common law by requiring disqualification when the 
judge had served as counsel for one of the parties. The first federal 
recusal statute, for example, required disqualification not only when the 
judge was "concerned in interest," but also when he "ha[d] been of 
counsel for either party, but many States followed suit by enacting 
similar disqualification statutes or constitutional provisions expanding 
the common-law rule, (deciding that it was for the judge to choose 
whether he could fairly adjudicate a case in which he had served as a 
lawyer for the plaintiff in the same action). Courts applied this expanded 
view of disqualification not only in cases involving judges who had 
previously served as counsel for private parties but also for those who 
previously served as former attorneys general or district attorneys. It was 
held as under; 
“This expansion was modest: disqualification was required only when 
the newly appointed judge had served as counsel in the same case. In 
Carr v. Fife, 156 U. S. 494 (1895), for example, this Court rejected the 
argument that a judge was required to recuse because he had previously 
served as counsel for some of the defendants in another matter. Id., at 
497-498. The Court left it to the judge "to decide for himself whether it 
was improper for him to sit in trial of the suit." Id., at 498. Likewise, in 

                    Crl. Misc. 10-T of 2024 
 
                         
 
 
 9 
 
Taylor v. Williams, 26 Tex. 583 (1863), the Supreme Court of Texas 
acknowledged that a judge was not, "by the common law, disqualified 
from sitting in a cause in which he had been of counsel" and concluded 
"that the fact that the presiding judge had been of counsel in the case did 
not necessarily render him interested in it." Id., at 585-586. A fortiori, 
the Texas court held, a judge was not "interested" in a case "merely from 
his having been of counsel in another cause involving the same title." 
Id., at 586 (emphasis added); see also The Richmond, 9 F. 863, 864 
(CCED La. 1881) ("The decisions, so far as I have been able to find, are 
unanimous that 'of counsel' means 'of counsel for a party in that cause 
and in that controversy,' and if either the cause or controversy is not 
identical the disqualification does not exist"); Wolfe v. Hines, 93 Ga. 
329, 20 S. E. 322 (1894) (same); Cleghorn v. Cleghorn, 66 Cal. 309, 5 
P. 516 (1885) (same).” 
 
11.         However, a little deviation in the principle with respect to district 
courts is found in our jurisdiction in the sense that a Magistrate cannot 
sit to hear the case if he had practiced as a pleader in the court of 
Magistrate in such district as mentioned in following section of Cr.P.C.;  
 
557. Practicing pleader not to sit as Magistrate in certain Courts: No 
pleader who practices in the Court of any Magistrate in a district, shall sit 
as a Magistrate in such Court or in any Court within the jurisdiction to 
such Court. 
 
As a result, thereof he can recuse from the case.           
 
12.      Adversaries in a criminal prosecution, no doubt, are the private 
parties but State as an important and impartial pillar in between two 
through the institution of Public Prosecution, is expected to ensure fair 
trial, due process and equal opportunities to both parties so as to fade 
out the impression of bias in the mind of a judge against any party. As 
per para 4.17 of Code of Conduct for Prosecutors issued under section 
17 of the Punjab Criminal Prosecution Service (Constitution, Functions 
and Powers) Act, 2006 it is the duty of a prosecutor that in accordance 
with the law or the requirements of fair trial, he shall seek to ensure that 
all necessary and reasonable enquiries are made and the responses taken 
into account while taking prosecutorial decisions.  
 
13.     In the light of above discussion, it was observed that learned 
counsel for the petitioner has not pointed out any material through 
which it could be inferred that learned Magistrate is personally 
interested in the case or is biased towards the petitioner in any manner. 
Allegation of bribery was also not made expressly nor advocated 
vigorously; so much so, it was conceded that trial is at initial stage, 
therefore, mere on the basis that magistrate is the caste fellow of counsel 
for the complainant and is conducting trial expeditiously, alleged 

                    Crl. Misc. 10-T of 2024 
 
                         
 
 
 10 
 
biasness cannot be anticipated at this stage of the proceedings; 
therefore, this petition merits outright dismissal which is dismissed 
accordingly with no orders as to the costs.
