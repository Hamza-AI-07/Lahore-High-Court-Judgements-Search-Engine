Date of Hearing: 
15.11.2023 
Petitioner by: 
Mr. 
Nasir 
Abbas 
Zafar 
Malik, 
Advocate.  
Respondents No.3 to 
5 by: 
Ms. Rabia Bajwa, Advocate. 
       Anwaar Hussain, J.  This constitutional petition is directed 
against judgment dated 06.07.2023, passed by the Additional District 
Judge, Ferozewala, who proceeded to accept the appeal of respondents 
No.3 to 5 and has upended the order dated 15.12.2022, passed by the 
Civil Judge 1st Class, Ferozewala and the application of the petitioner, 
under Order XXXIX Rules 1 & 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 
(“CPC”), filed alongwith her suit for declaration and cancellation of 
the document as also recovery of possession and permanent injunction, 
was dismissed.  
2. 
By way of factual background, it has been noted that the 
petitioner, deceased Muhammad Sharif [(predecessor-in-interest of 
respondents No.3(a) to 3(f)], deceased Nazir Ahmad [(predecessor-in-
interest of respondents No.4(a) to 4(g)] and Manzoor Ali, were real 
brothers and sister who were children of one Noor Din. For facility of 
reference, predecessors of respondents No.3(a) to 3(f), 4(a) to 4(g) and 
respondent No.5, are collectively referred as “the respondents”. 
3. 
The dispute relates to part of total property, measuring 40-
Kanals, detail whereof is given in the headnote of the plaint of the suit 
which was owned by Noor Din. Apart from the petitioner and the 
respondents, Noor Din also had other children namely, Munawar Bibi, 

2 
W.P. No.50316 of 2023 
 
 
Zuhran Bibi and Bashiran Bibi. The petitioner instituted the suit laying 
challenge to the oral gift mutation bearing No.86 dated 28.04.1984, in 
favour of the respondents, on ground of fraud as a result of which the 
petitioner was deprived from her share of inheritance in the property 
left by her father, Noor Din.  
4. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that findings of the 
Courts below are at variance and well-reasoned order of the Trial Court 
has been upset by the Appellate Court below merely on the technical 
ground that while laying challenge to the impugned oral mutation in 
favour of her brothers (the respondents), the petitioner has not arrayed 
other legal heirs of Noor Din in her suit, as defendants, which is not a 
plausible ground for dismissing the application of the petitioner, under 
Order XXXIX, Rules 1 & 2, CPC as said legal heirs of Noor Din are 
neither necessary party nor any relief was claimed against them. 
5. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondents submits that the 
petitioner has failed to establish a prima facie case as she intentionally 
has not arrayed her other siblings as defendants. Adds that the 
respondents are in possession of the disputed property for the last 38-
years and nothing has been brought on record to establish as to when 
the petitioner came to know about the sanctioning of impugned oral gift 
mutation and whether the petitioner was ever given any share in the 
produce (حصہ بٹائی). Places reliance upon cases reported as “Mst. 
Sheedan Begum and others v. Muhammad Usman Khan and others” 
(2021 MLD 1937) and “Ashiq Muhammad and others v. Mst. 
Suhagan” (2023 SCMR 1171) in support of her contentions. 
6. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
7. 
It is settled principle of law that in order to succeed in obtaining 
temporary injunction in a case, a plaintiff has to establish co-existence 
of three conditions/ingredients i.e., (i) prima facie case; (ii) possibility 
of suffering irreparable loss if temporary injunction is declined; and 

3 
W.P. No.50316 of 2023 
 
 
(iii) that the balance of convenience leans in favour of the plaintiff. Of 
the above referred three conditions, existence of prima facie case is 
foundational and the other two conditions are considered only once the 
plaintiff establishes a prima facie case in his favour. This assessment is 
to be carried out by the learned Trial Court while examining the 
pleadings of the parties. In plaint of her suit, the petitioner alleged 
commission of fraud by stating that she had not transferred the disputed 
property by way of oral gift to the respondents and when written 
statement was filed, plea was taken that the share of the petitioner in 
the property left by the father of the petitioner was purchased by the 
respondents. Para No.5 of the written statement is reproduced 
hereunder:

There is an apparent disconnect, in respect of the nature of the transfer 
by the petitioner in favour of the respondents, between the impugned 
gift mutation in favour of the respondents and the stance taken by the 
respondents in written statement that clearly establishes the existence 
of prima facie case in favour of the petitioner as there was no 
justification for the respondents for getting the impugned oral gift 
mutation sanctioned in their favour instead of a sale mutation if the 
petitioner received price of her share and sold the disputed property. 
The petitioner being weaker segment of the society has been deprived 
of her share in inheritance in the property left by her father. She will 
certainly face inconvenience due to multiplicity of litigation if interim 
relief is not granted restraining the respondents from further alienating 
the disputed property and creating third party interest in respect thereof. 

4 
W.P. No.50316 of 2023 
 
 
This fact had rightly been appreciated by the learned Trial Court, vide 
order dated 15.12.2022, operative part whereof is reproduced 
hereunder: 
“4…..In the instant case, plaintiff has called in question the 
transaction whereby she has been deprived of her rights to 
property and onus is shifted upon defendants to prove 
genuineness of transaction through cogent and convincing 
evidence. Moreover, it is settled practice in our society 
that females are deprived of their rights to property by 
their family as well as close male relatives. Perusal of 
mutation shows that the same has been sanctioned on basis 
of oral gift whereas defendants in their written statement 
took stance that they purchased property after payment of 
its value. In cases of gift, no value is to be paid. 
Transaction of sale and gift are totally different to each 
other. Thus stance taken by defendants is ambiguous and 
against revenue record. Hence plaintiff has proved her 
prima facie case. If temporary injunction is not granted 
and property is further alienated, plaintiff would face 
irreparable loss and it would give birth of future 
complications and multiplicity of litigation.” 
(Emphasis provided) 
8. 
On the contrary, the Appellate Court below has dismissed the 
application of the petitioner, under Order XXXIX Rules 1 & 2, CPC on 
the ground, that petitioner has not arrayed her other siblings in the suit 
as defendants, which is alien to the ingredients required for grant or 
refusal of the temporary injunction. The said siblings, at the most, were 
proper parties and non-impleading thereof is an irregularity, which is 
not a non-curable defect. Needless to mention that the general rule is 
that the plaintiff in a suit is dominus litis and may choose the person 
against whom he wishes to litigate and cannot be forced to sue a person 
against whom he does not seek any relief. Even otherwise, the learned 
Appellate Court below lost the sight of settled legal position regarding 
the distinction between the non-joinder who ought to have been joined 
as a party and the non-joinder of a person whose joinder is only a 
matter of convenience or expediency, as is the position in the instant 
case where the petitioner is not claiming any right against her siblings 

5 
W.P. No.50316 of 2023 
 
 
who have not been arrayed as the defendants, since the disputed 
property, forming part of the inheritance share of the petitioner in the 
property left by her father, is being claimed by the respondents and not 
the said other siblings of the petitioner. Judgments relied upon by the 
respondents’ side, having been considered, are found distinguishable, 
on account of facts as well as legal question involved.  
9. 
In view of the above discussion, this constitutional petition is 
allowed and the impugned judgment of Appellate Court below is set 
aside and the order passed by the Trial Court is upheld. No order as to 
costs. Before parting with, it is also made clear that the observations 
and findings in this judgment are tentative in nature and made for 
deciding the application of the petitioner for grant of interim injunction, 
only. The learned Trial Court shall not be prejudiced by the said 
observations while finally deciding the suit of the petitioner.
