Through this petition under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the 
following prayer has been made: 
 
“it is, therefore, humbly prayed that by accepting 
this writ petition, the impugned order dated 
06.03.2024 passed by respondent No.1 may kindly be 
declared illegal, against the law & facts, perverse, 
arbitrary, fanciful and the same may very kindly be set 
aside.” 
 
2.  
The brief facts of the case leading up to the filing of 
instant petition are that the case F.I.R No. 2748 of 2023 was 
registered at the Police Station City Lodhran, in respect of an 
offence under section 489F P.P.C. on the information of 
Muhammad Usman, the respondent No.6 and during the 
course of investigation of the case, an application was 
submitted by Muhammad Ramzan, the father of Muhammad 
Usman, for the change of the investigation before the District 
Standing Board, Lodhran, however, that application was 
declined after Muhammad Ramzan, the father of Muhammad 
Usman (respondent N.6), submitted an affidavit that they did 
not want to get the case investigated any further from the local 

2 
W.P. No.1780 of 2024 
 
 
police. After the meeting of the District Standing Board, 
Lodhran, was held on 17.02.2024, the change of the 
investigation of the case F.I.R No. 2748 of 2023, was not 
recommended. Subsequently, Muhammad Usman, moved an 
application to the Regional Police Officer, Multan seeking the 
change of the investigation of the case F.I.R No.2748 of 2023 
and after receiving the said application, the matter was placed 
before the Regional Standing Board, which after its meeting 
on 02.03.2024, recommended that the investigation of the case 
be indeed transferred. The instant petition has been filed 
against the order dated 06.03.2024, as passed by the Regional 
Police Officer, Multan, whereby the investigation of the case 
F.I.R No.2748 of 2023, registered at Police Station City, 
Lodhran, District Lodhran, was ordered to be changed in the 
light of the recommendation of the Regional Standing Board.  
3. 
The learned counsel for the petitioner, inter alia, 
contended that the order dated 06.03.2024 passed by the 
Regional Police Officer Multan (respondent No.1) whereby 
the investigation of the case F.I.R No.2748 of 2023 registered 
at Police Station City Lodhran, District Lodhran has been 
changed, was liable to be set-aside being against the facts and 
the law; that the proper course for ordering the change of 
investigation was not followed prior to the passing of the 
impugned order. 
4. 
The learned Assistant Advocate General, Punjab as well 
as the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent 
No.6, have submitted that the order passed by the Regional 
Police Officer, Multan, was based upon facts and law 
applicable, therefore, no interference in the same was 
warranted.  
5. 
I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, the 
learned Assistant Advocate General, Punjab, the learned 
counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent No.6 and have 
perused the record with their able assistance.

W.P. No.1780 of 2024 
 
 
6. 
The procedure for the change of the investigation has 
been clearly narrated in the Article 18(A) of the Police Order, 
2002, wherein it has been provided that the District Police 
Officer, after obtaining opinion of the District Standing Board 
and for reasons to be recorded in writing may transfer the 
investigation of a case to any other investigation officer and if 
the District Police Officer has decided an application for 
transfer of the case, the Regional Police Officer may, within 
seven working days of the filing of an application, after 
obtaining opinion of the Regional Standing Board and for 
reasons to be recorded in writing, transfer investigation of a 
case also. For ready reference the provisions of the Article 
18(A) of the Police Order, 2002, Amendment Act, 2013 are 
reproduced as under: 
“18A. Transfer of investigation.– (1) Within seven 
working days of the filing of an application, the Head of 
District Police may, after obtaining opinion of the 
District Standing Board and for reasons to be recorded 
in writing, transfer investigation of a case from the 
investigation officer to any other investigation officer or 
a team of investigation officers of a rank equal to or 
higher than the rank of the previous investigation officer.  
(2) If the Head of District Police has decided an 
application for transfer of investigation, the Regional 
Police Officer may, within seven working days of the 
filing of an application, after obtaining opinion of the 
Regional Standing Board and for reasons to be recorded 
in writing, transfer investigation of a case from the 
investigation officer or a team of investigation officers to 
any other investigation officer or a team of investigation 
officers of a rank equal to or higher than the rank of the 
previous investigation officer or officers.  
(3) If a Regional Police Officer has decided an 
application for transfer of an investigation, the 
Provincial Police Officer may, within thirty days of filing 
of an application, after obtaining opinion of a Standing 
Review Board, transfer investigation of a case to an 
investigation officer or a team of investigation officers of 

4 
W.P. No.1780 of 2024 
 
 
a rank equal to or higher than the rank of the previous 
investigation officer or officers.  
(4) A case under investigation with a District 
Investigation Branch may only be transferred to another 
officer or a team of officers of the District Investigation 
Branch, Regional Investigation Branch or Provincial 
Investigation Branch.  
(5) For the purpose of this Article–  
(a)  
‘District Standing Board’ means the District 
Standing Board constituted by the Head of 
District Police consisting of a Superintendent of 
Police as chairperson and two officers not below 
the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police as 
members; 7 Inserted by the Punjab Police Order 
(Amendment) Act 2013 (XXI of 2013).  
(b)  
‘Regional Standing Board’ means the Regional 
Standing Board constituted by the Regional Police 
Officer consisting of a Superintendent of Police as 
chairperson and two Superintendents of Police as 
members; 
(c)  
‘Standing Review Board’ means the Standing 
Review Board constituted by the Provincial Police 
Officer consisting of a Deputy Inspector General 
of Police as chairperson and two officers not 
below the rank of Superintendent of Police as 
members; and  
(d)  
reference to Head of District Police and Regional 
Police Officer in the case of Capital City District 
shall be construed to mean the Head of District 
Investigation Branch of the Capital City and the 
Capital City Police Officer, respectively.” 
In the present case, it was after the order of the District Police 
Officer, Lodhran, refusing to recommend the transfer of the 
investigation of the case  F.I.R No.2748 of 2023, registered at 
Police Station City, Lodhran, District Lodhran that  the 
respondent No.6 moved an application before the Regional 
Police Officer, Multan seeking the transfer of the investigation 
of the case. The said application of the respondent No.6 was 
placed before the Regional Standing Board and the Regional 

5 
W.P. No.1780 of 2024 
 
 
Standing Board, in its meeting held on 02.03.2024, 
recommended the change of the investigation of the case and 
in the light of that recommendation , the Regional Police 
Officer, Multan, passed the impugned order dated 06.03.2024, 
whereby the investigation of the case was transferred and 
entrusted to the Regional Investigation Branch (RIB), Multan. 
The learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the 
earlier application submitted by Muhammad Ramzan, the 
father of Muhammad Usman (respondent No.6) to the District 
Police Officer, Lodhran, seeking the change of the 
investigation, was dismissed for the fact Muhammad Ramzan, 
the father of Muhammad Usman (respondent No.6) himself 
has submitted an application for the withdrawal of the said 
application, therefore, no second application for the transfer of 
the case could have been validly filed by Muhammad Usman 
(respondent No.6). In this regard, it is observed that the 
provisions of the Article 18(A) of the Police Order, 2002, 
Amendment Act, 2013  only speak of the authority of the 
Regional Police Officer to receive an application for the 
change of the investigation and place it before the Regional 
Standing Board, after the District Police Officer has decided 
an earlier application for change of the investigation and does 
not speak that what reasons should be there that the District 
Police Officer had decided the application before another 
application can be validly filed before the Regional Police 
Officer, seeking the transfer of the investigation. The 
provisions of the Article 18(A) of the Police Order, 2002, 
provide that after the District Police Officer has decided the 
application, the Regional Police Officer may, within seven 
working days of the filing of an application, after obtaining 
opinion of the Regional Standing Board and for reasons to be 
recorded in writing, transfer investigation of a case to another 
Investigating Officer. One of the cardinal rules of 
interpretation of statute is that the grammatical and ordinary 
sense of the words used by the Legislature in expressing its 

6 
W.P. No.1780 of 2024 
 
 
intention is to be adhered to. If literal adherence to the words 
of any enactment appears to produce an absurdity or an 
injustice, it will be the duty of a Court, so interpreting, to 
consider the state of the law at the time the Act was passed 
with the view to ascertaining whether the language of the 
enactment is capable of another fair interpretation or whether 
it may not be desirable to put upon the language used, a 
restrictive meaning. The first rule of construing any enactment 
is to give the words their natural meaning and it is only if no 
reasonable result can be arrived at by giving the words their 
natural meaning that some other interpretation is permissible. 
The first and the safest principle of interpretation of statutes is  
to remain within the language of law and not going beyond the 
intendments. The language of the Article 18(A) of the Police 
Order, 2002 is very clear in its meaning therefore there is no 
need to read any words into the Article 18(A) of the Police 
Order, 2002. No particular reasons for the refusal of the 
application for the transfer of the investigation of the case by 
the District Police Officer, before an application can be 
submitted to the  Regional Police Officer,have been 
mentioned in the Article 18(A) of the Police Order, 2002  and  
had the legislation intended to restrict the submission of an 
application to the Regional Police Officer, in a certain case 
after its dismissal by the District Police Officer, then the 
legislation would have used those words. The very fact that 
the legislation has not mentioned in the Article 18(A) of the 
Police Order, 2002  any particular reason for the refusal of the 
application for the transfer of the investigation of the case by 
the District Police Officer, the absence or presence of which 
reason for deciding an application by the District Police 
Officer would regulate the filing of an application of change 
of investigation   before the  Regional Police Officer,reflects 
that it had no intention to do so. As there was no legal bar 
restricting the filing of an application by the respondent No6 
before the Regional Police Officer, Multan seeking the 

7 
W.P. No.1780 of 2024 
 
 
transfer of the case F.I.R No.2748 of 2023, registered at Police 
Station City, Lodhran, District Lodhran after the order of the 
District Police Officer, Lodhran, refusing to recommend the 
transfer of the investigation of the case  F.I.R No.2748 of 
2023, registered at Police Station City, Lodhran, District 
Lodhran and as the Regional Police Officer proceeded in 
accordance with the law after receiving the application as 
submitted by the respondent No.6 ,no exception can be taken 
to the order dated 06.03.2024, as passed by the Regional 
Police Officer, Multan, whereby the investigation of the case 
F.I.R No.2748 of 2023, registered at Police Station City, 
Lodhran, District Lodhran, was ordered to be changed in the 
light of the recommendation of the Regional Standing Board. 
7. 
In view of the above discussion, this petition being 
meritless, is dismissed.
