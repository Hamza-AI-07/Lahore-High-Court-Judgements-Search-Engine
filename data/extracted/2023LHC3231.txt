Respondent No.3: 
Proceeded ex-parte on 05.04.2022. 
       Anwaar Hussain, J.  Briefly stated facts of the case are that, 
on 29.09.2004, respondent No.1 instituted a suit for declaration 
along with recovery of possession etc., with regard to the suit 
property, detail whereof, is given in the headnote of the plaint 
appended with the present petition and vide judgment and decree 
dated 05.01.2013, the learned Trial Court decreed the suit, after 
framing of issues and recording of evidence of the parties. The 
appeal preferred by the predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners 
against the judgment and decree dated 05.01.2013 was dismissed by 
the learned Additional District Judge, Hafizabad, vide judgment and 
decree dated 17.06.2014. Hence, the present Civil Revision. 
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the suit 
property is a shop and respondent No.1 instituted the suit on the 
basis of PTD No.2512 dated 08.08.1968 as well as the mutation 

2 
C.R. No.2534/2014 
 
 
bearing No.15252 that was sanctioned on the strength of the PTD, 
however, the said document is not available on record and 
therefore, respondent No.1 failed to prove his title to the suit 
property and as a consequence thereof, the concurrent findings of 
the learned Courts below are not sustainable. Places reliance upon 
“Manzoor Ahmad and 9 others v. Ghulam Nabi and 5 others” (2010 
CLC 350) to contend that in case the title document of the suit 
property is not produced, possession thereof cannot be recovered. 
Further contends that the impugned judgment dated 17.06.2014 
finds the petitioners to be the owner of their respective property 
along with respondent No.1 in the same Khasra, and therefore, 
there was no justification to disregard the sale deed of the 
petitioners on the strength of which the petitioners are in 
possession. Further states that the learned Trial Court was obligated 
to obtain a demarcation report so as to ascertain the location of the 
suit property in possession of the petitioners as well as the property 
described in purported PTD as per version of respondent No.1, 
within the same Khasra and without determining the same, the 
learned Trial Court could not have rendered a just decision. Further 
adds that the petitioners are in possession of the suit property on the 
strength of a registered document that cannot be brushed aside and 
has been erroneously cancelled by the learned Trial Court. Places 
reliance upon cases reported as “Anwar Club and another v. 
Muhammad Sarwar” (PLD 1992 Lahore 63); “Mst. Hajran Begum 
v. Kh. Muhammad Yousaf and Legal Heirs” (2005 MLD 592); and 
“Syed Mahboob Shah v. Tehsil Nazim, Pishin and another” (2012 
SCMR 196) in support of his contentions. Concludes that a Local 
Commission was appointed to ascertain the location of shop of 
respondent No.1 and the said report has been relied and believed 
upon by the learned Courts below although its author never 
appeared before the learned Trial Court.  
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for respondent No.1 submits that 
concurrent findings of fact are immune from any interference in 

3 
C.R. No.2534/2014 
 
 
revisional jurisdiction unless there is any misreading and non-
reading of evidence that could not be pointed out by the petitioners’ 
side. Adds that the suit property is part of an urbanized area and 
therefore, it becomes irrelevant that the petitioners and respondent 
No.1 are owners in the same Khasra. Further contends that the PTD 
through which respondent No.1 purchased the suit property, in an 
auction, has lost its significance inasmuch as on the strength of the 
same, mutation was sanctioned and the said PTD was incorporated 
in the revenue record, therefore, even if the original PTD is not 
available, the same is not fatal to the case of respondent No.1.  
4. 
Learned counsel for respondent No.2 has supported the 
stance of the petitioners whereas proforma respondent has already 
been proceeded ex-parte, vide order dated 05.04.2022. 
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
6. 
At the outset, it is imperative to observe that this Court in 
exercise of its revisional jurisdiction is reluctant to interfere in the 
concurrent findings of the Courts below, however, it is not a rule of 
thumb and this Court cannot close its eyes where the learned Courts 
below misinterpreted the material available on record or erred in 
appreciating the same, in its proper perspective, or overlooked to 
comprehend the same. Therefore, the argument of learned counsel 
for respondent No.1 in this regard is misconceived that concurrent 
findings cannot be set-aside in revision and hence, discarded. 
7. 
The nub of the matter is to examine whether respondent No.1 
was able to discharge the burden of proof while seeking declaration 
of his title to the suit property and possession thereof as also 
seeking cancellation of the registered sale deed of the petitioners. 
Admittedly, the suit was instituted on the strength of the mutation 
bearing No.15252, which was admittedly sanctioned on the basis of 
the PTD bearing No.2512 dated 08.08.1968. The PTD was the main 
title document that was admittedly not produced in evidence.  The 
learned Courts below erred by not appreciating this aspect of the 

4 
C.R. No.2534/2014 
 
 
matter. In-fact, the learned Appellate Court below have erroneously 
comprehended letter bearing No.ADC(G)/Sett/U 570 H.Z (5) U, 
dated 21.02.1991 to be the PTD, by holding as under: 
“9. 
The perusal of written statement shows that the 
petitioner/appellant did not take the plea in her written 
statement that the respondent No.1/plaintiff purchased 
the property in street No.2 or that the alleged PTD 
pertained to the property situated in street No.2, 
therefore, she cannot be allowed to plead contrary to 
her pleadings. Further, the document Ex.P7 is the 
certified copy of the PTD, therefore, it is wrongly 
stated in the application for summoning of the record 
that attested copy of the PTD was not produced by the 
respondent/plaintiff.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
At this juncture, it is imperative to reproduce the contents of the 
letter dated 21.02.1991(Ex.P7), which read as under:

A bare perusal of the above quoted letter reveals that the same is 
not the PTD and hence, the conclusion drawn by the learned Courts 
below in general and the learned Appellate Court below in 
particular is erroneous and gross misreading of evidence. Therefore, 
on this material misreading of evidence alone, the concurrent 
findings of the Courts below are liable to be set aside as it is trite 
law that the Courts are expected to deliver justice, which is not only 
to be done but also seen to be done, and cannot shut their eyes or 
turn a deaf ear to perverse conclusion based on patent errors on 
account of misreading and non-reading of evidence.  
8. 
Argument of learned counsel for respondent No.1 that after 
implementation of the PTD in the revenue record, the original title 
document i.e., the PTD in the instant case, even if not available, 
looses its significance and makes no difference is a bizarre 
argument, to say the least, on two counts. Firstly, mutation of a 
property in the revenue record neither creates nor extinguishes the 
title to the property or has any presumptive value qua title as such 
entries are relevant only for the purpose of collecting land revenue. 
Secondly, if the mutation on the basis of which right in the property 
is claimed, is disputed on account of absence of the original 
PTD/registered deed, etc., the onus of proving the correctness of the 
mutation and genuineness of the transaction contained therein 
would be on the party claiming the right. Therefore, without 
bringing on record the original PTD on the strength of which the 

6 
C.R. No.2534/2014 
 
 
mutation was sanctioned, respondent No.1 failed to prove that he is 
entitled to be declared as owner of the suit property let alone 
seeking cancellation of registered sale deed of the petitioners in 
respect thereof. In this regard, learned counsel for the petitioners 
has correctly placed reliance on case of Manzoor Ahmad supra in 
which this Court held that while seeking possession of the property, 
a plaintiff is under a bounden duty to establish his ownership 
without any shadow of doubt, by producing title document and 
while doing so the burden of proof on a party is to be discharged 
unclinchingly and not with shaky evidence. Moreover, the 
application of the predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners filed 
with the learned Appellate Court below for summoning the original 
record pertaining to the issuance of the PTD was wrongly dismissed 
that defeated the ends of justice and the letter dated 21.02.1991 has 
been erroneously considered as the PTD. 
9. 
Moreover, admittedly, a Local Commission was appointed to 
ascertain the location of shop of respondent No.1 and report 
rendered by the said Commission has been relied and believed upon 
by the learned Courts below to the extent that registered sale deed 
of the petitioners has been cancelled although author of the report 
never appeared before the learned Trial Court. Admittedly, no 
permission was obtained from the learned Trial Court in accordance 
with law by respondent No.1, to lead secondary evidence in this 
regard. Even otherwise, perusal of the report reveals that the same 
is not comprehensive, rather unilateral and does not depict any 
observation in relation to the suit property in possession of the 
petitioners qua the registered sale deed in favour of the 
predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners and hence, do not 
constitute a reliable and conclusive piece of evidence that can form 
basis of passing of declaratory decree etc., in favour of respondent 
No.1.   
10. 
There is yet another angle of the matter from which the 
present lis can be examined. In his suit for declaration alongwith 

7 
C.R. No.2534/2014 
 
 
recovery of possession, respondent No.1 mentioned about his 
absence from Hafizabad where the suit property is situated on 
account of his travel to Rawalpindi and asserted that in his absence, 
allegedly occupation of the suit property was unlawfully taken by 
the predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners and illegal construction 
was raised thereon and upon confrontation, the rent was settled 
between the parties for the occupation thereof, but none of these 
assertions were proved when the evidence was led and recorded, 
that fact also raises a serious doubt about the veracity of the claim 
of respondent No.1 that suit property belongs to him and was 
fraudulent occupied by the petitioners in addition to the fact that 
original title document (PTD) was not brought on record.  
11. 
In view of the above discussion, this Civil Revision is 
allowed, the impugned judgments of the learned Courts below are 
set-aside and the suit of respondent No.1 is dismissed. No order as 
to cost.
