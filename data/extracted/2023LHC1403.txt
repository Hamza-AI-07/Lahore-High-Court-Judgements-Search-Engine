Anwaar Hussain, J.  Through this single judgment, the present 
as well as Civil Revision No.1089/2009 are intended to be decided.   
2. 
Subject matter of the present Civil Revision is validity of 
mutation bearing No.671 dated 17.01.1981 based on an oral gift, 
which the petitioners claim to have been legally made, by one Jalal-
ud-Din, in favour of predecessor-in-interest of petitioners No.1(a) to 
1(e), namely, Muhammad Rasheed and petitioner No.2, namely, Shah 
Muhammad. Challenge was laid by the respondents to the above 
referred impugned mutation No.671 on the strength of inquiry report 
conducted by the Officials concerned (respondents No.1 to 5 in 
connected Civil Revision No.1089/2009) for ascertaining the actual 
date of death of the deceased Jalal-ud-Din and an order dated 
11.04.1992 was passed thereon by the said Officials whereafter claim 
of the respondents regarding actual date of death of Jalal-ud-Din was 
accepted. The suit instituted by the respondents was decreed by the 
learned Trial Court vide judgment dated 08.06.2006 and the said 
findings were upheld by the learned Appellate Court below, in appeal 
preferred by the petitioners. Civil Revision No.1089/2009 is being 

2 
C.R. No.1090/2009 
 
 
treated as a connected matter inasmuch as the above referred inquiry 
report and order(s) passed thereon were challenged by the petitioners 
by instituting a separate/independent declaratory suit that was 
concurrently dismissed in favour of the respondents and said findings 
have been assailed by the petitioners through connected Civil 
Revision referred above. Although after framing of the issues, the 
suits instituted by the petitioners and the respondents were separately 
contested and decided through separate judgments in favour of the 
respondents, yet both the petitions are so interwoven with each other 
that the decision in one case has direct implications on the decision in 
other and learned counsel for the parties are in agreement to that 
effect, therefore, with their consent present petition is treated as the 
main case and Civil Revision No.1089/2009 as a connected matter and 
both are being decided through this single judgment.  
3. 
It is case of the petitioners that they are owners of the disputed 
property by virtue of the impugned mutation based on an oral gift 
recorded in their favour. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits 
that both the learned Courts below have erred in appreciating the 
evidentiary resume as well as factual matrix of the case inasmuch as 
reliance has been placed upon an inquiry report that is self-
contradictory. Adds that the learned Courts below have not 
appreciated the fact that there is no dispute regarding possession of the 
petitioners over the suit property. Further asserts that the respondents 
being plaintiffs were to stand on their own legs and could not take 
benefit of weaknesses of the petitioners/defendants. Places reliance on 
case reported as “Muhammad Sher and others v. Mst. Taj Meena and 
other” (PLD 1996 Peshawar 6) in this regard. Further adds that the 
impugned inquiry report, which has been heavily relied upon by the 
learned Trial Court to decree the suit of the respondents was not a 
valid piece of evidence inasmuch as its scribe was not produced 
before the Court and in this regard places reliance on case reported as 

3 
C.R. No.1090/2009 
 
 
“Khan Muhammad Yusuf Khan Khattak v. S.M. Ayub and 2 others” 
(PLD 1973 Supreme Court 160). Concludes that issue wise findings 
were not given; that the record also substantiated the factum of death 
as pleaded by the petitioners; that the claim of the respondents was 
rejected by the revenue hierarchy, hence, the subsequent suit was not 
maintainable on the basis of Section 11 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908 („the CPC‟) and that the death certificate relied upon 
by the respondents pertains to one Jalal-ud-Din Joiya, however, the 
deceased donor belongs to Toor family, therefore, the said certificate 
is of no help to the respondents.   
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondents submits that 
the deceased Muhammad Rasheed [predecessor-in-interest of 
petitioners No.1(a) to 1(e)] and Shah Muhammad (petitioner No.2), 
both sons of Noor Muhammad (deceased) were not real maternal 
grandsons of the donor, Jalal-ud-Din. Adds that even otherwise, there 
was no logic as to why a person will deprive his own children in order 
to give benefit to the maternal grandchildren. Further contends that in 
case of oral Hiba, the beneficiary is obligated to refer to the time, 
place and name of witnesses in whose presence the offer of gift is 
made by the donor and the same is accepted by the donee, which is 
conspicuously missing in the written statement filed by the 
petitioners‟ side. Further avers that apart from the above 
discrepancies, in relation to the impugned gift, neither attesting 
witnesses of the impugned mutation were produced nor secondary 
evidence was led. Concludes that not only fraud was alleged by the 
respondents but the fact that the donor was on his death bed due to 
serious illness few months prior to the date when the impugned 
mutation was recorded was also asserted in the plaint and also proved 
by leading oral evidence.

Arguments heard. Record perused.

6. 
The basic issue relates to actual/correct date of death of the 
donor, namely, Jalal-ud-Din who admittedly was predecessor-in-
interest of the respondents. The petitioners/ defendants claim that the 
donor was their maternal grandfather and validly made the gift.  It is 
also assertion of the petitioners that the respondents assailed the 
impugned mutation on the revenue side and their claim was rejected 
and hence, subsequent suit on the same subject is hit by doctrine of 
res-judicata and the suit was badly time barred, while it is case of the 
respondents that the donor was already dead on the date of recording 
of the impugned mutation, after suffering from serious illness, and the 
correct date of death has been clearly established through the inquiry 
conducted by the Officials, status of which is subject matter of the 
connected Civil Revision No.1089/2009.  
7. 
The fundamental questions that call for determination by this 
Court on which learned counsel for the petitioners has laid a lot of 
stress is to opine whether the suit instituted by the respondents was 
time barred and whether the decision on the revenue side operates as 
res-judicata in the suit instituted by the respondents before the Civil 
Court. Both these questions have been dealt with by the learned 
Courts below. It is settled principle of law that fraud vitiates the most 
solemn proceedings and thus period of limitation would not be an 
embargo upon a justifiable claim directed against fraud, more 
particularly if same involves right of a person to inheritance of the 
property. Therefore, the learned Courts below have rightly held the 
suit of the respondents to be within time.  
8. 
As regards applicability of principle of res-judicata on the suit 
instituted by the respondents, it is imperative to note that any decision, 
on the revenue side, does not operate as bar on a subsequent civil suit, 
more particularly, when question of fraud is involved in respect of 
which the jurisdiction of the Revenue Authorities is barred, for the 
reasons that the proceedings before the Revenue Officers and/or the 

5 
C.R. No.1090/2009 
 
 
Revenue Courts are summarily conducted without recording of 
evidence. Section 11 of the CPC that is based on doctrine of res-
judicata clearly stipulates that no subsequent suit shall be entertained 
in which the matter is directly and substantially the same in a former 
suit between the same parties and decided by a Court of competent 
jurisdiction. Therefore, Section 11 of the CPC is applicable only 
where earlier as well as the subsequent proceedings are before the 
Courts, which are competent to decide both the matters. Reliance is 
placed on case reported as “Rehmatullah v. Ali Muhammad and 
another” (1983 SCMR 1064). In the instant case, earlier proceedings 
were on the revenue side that, as observed earlier, are summary in 
nature, conducted without recording of evidence. Therefore, one of the 
necessary conditions for the applicability of principle of res-judicata 
that former suit should have been decided by the Court competent to 
try the subsequent suit is an aspect that is missing in the instant case as 
the Revenue Court and Civil Court are not vested with the similar 
jurisdiction rather their jurisdiction is mutually exclusive to each other 
in certain matters. Jurisdiction of Civil Court is barred in terms of 
Section 172 of Land Revenue Act, 1967 (“the Act”) only with respect 
to matters exclusively vested in the jurisdiction of Revenue Courts 
under the said provision and civil suit is always maintainable under 
Section 53 of the Act to establish right or title in respect of immovable 
property where the Revenue Court lacks jurisdiction. Moreover, this 
Court in judgment reported as “Arshad Ali and 6 others v. Muhammad 
Tufail through L.Rs. and others” (2013 CLC 632) has held as under: 
“6.….It is true that any order made by Revenue 
Authorities under the West Pakistan Land Revenue Act, 
1967 do not bar any party to establish his right or title in 
respect of immovable property by invoking jurisdiction of 
civil court. There is also no cavil to the proposition that 
order passed by the Revenue Authorities does not operate 
as res judicata under Section 11 C.P.C…….”

C.R. No.1090/2009 
 
 
9. 
Having held hereinabove that the suit of the respondent was 
well in time and principle of res-judicata is not applicable, it is 
imperative to examine merits of the case. Scanning of the record 
reveals that one of the respondents, namely, Muhammad Ismail 
appeared as PW-5 and produced as many as four witnesses including 
Imam Masjid (PW-2), namely, Abdul Rehman, who categorically 
supported the version of the respondents/plaintiffs that Jalal-ud-Din 
expired on 01.11.1980 prior to the execution of the impugned oral gift. 
The inquiry report, which was brought on record as Exh.P-1 also 
reflects that the date of death as claimed by the petitioners, who are 
beneficiaries of an oral transaction, was recorded in the relevant 
record, by the petitioners after a gap of more than 10-years 
challenging already existing entry related to death recorded by the 
respondents and hence, the same raises serious doubt about veracity of 
the claim of the petitioners. The controversy has been aptly dealt with 
by the learned Trial Court while rendering findings on material issues 
No.9 and 10, in the following terms: 
“6. ……ISSUES No.9 to 10 
These issues are material and very important upon which the 
entire fate of the suit hinges. Onus to prove these issues has 
been placed on plaintiffs. EX.P.1 is the detailed inquiry 
report of the Revenue authorities with regard to 
determination of date of death of deceased Jalal Din. It 
appears from a bare perusal of this inquiry report that death 
entry recorded in the record of Union Council was found to 
be 1-11-80 and not 6-6-81 as alleged by defendants. It was 
also found in the inquiry report that death entry of 
deceased Jalal din recorded on 1-11-80 was prior in time 
whereas the death entry of deceased Jalal din claimed by 
the defendants as 6-6-81 was subsequent in time. PW.1 is 
the record keeper in the office of Assistant Director, Local 
Government, Lahore who produced the inquiry report. PW.2 
is the Imam Masjid of the village Mosque where deceased 
Jalal Din used to live. In his examination in chief he has 
stated that he conducted Namaz-e-Janaza of deceased 
Jalal din. In his cross-examination he has stated that 
deceased Jalal Din died at the age of 80/85 years.”

Moreover, no malafide on part of the Officials concerned could be 
pointed out by learned counsel for the petitioners to question the 
authenticity of the inquiry report (Exh.P-1). Furthermore, the learned 
Appellate Court below while appraising the evidence on record has 
also put forth cogent reasons to uphold the findings of the learned 
Trial Court.  
10. 
Similarly, even if the argument is accepted that the inquiry 
report has no evidentiary value in the light of dicta laid down in case 
of Khan Muhammad Yusuf Khan Khattak supra as statement of its 
scribe has not been recorded in the suit instituted by the respondents, 
matter can be examined from another angle without placing any 
reliance on the said inquiry report and taking benefit from the same. It 
is by now well-settled that a mutation by itself does not create any title 
unless it can be substantiated to be backed by a valid transaction more 
particularly if the transaction is in the nature of Hiba depriving legal 
heirs of the donor. In the instant case, such detail is conspicuous by its 
absence inasmuch as neither the time of offer and acceptance of the 
gift has been mentioned in the written statement nor any witness has 
been produced in support of the said contentions. A pointed question 
was put thrice to learned counsel for the petitioners as to who were the 
marginal witnesses of the impugned mutation or witnesses of any oral 
offer or acceptance of the gift, on the strength of which the petitioners 
were claiming the title of the suit property, admittedly owned by 
predecessor-in-interest of the respondents prior to sanctioning of the 
impugned mutation, the answer could not be given, which fact alone 
defies the claim of the petitioners. This aspect has been also examined 
by the learned Trial Court with cogent reasons, in the light of dicta 
laid down in number of reported judgments. Relevant part from the 
impugned judgment is reproduced hereunder: 
“6. …In 2003 YLR 3184 it was held that particulars of 
gift namely the date of offer, acceptance and transfer of 

8 
C.R. No.1090/2009 
 
 
possession should be mentioned in the pleadings. In 
1994 MLD 467 it was held that onus to prove the 
transaction of gift lies on the donee who claims to be 
beneficiary thereof. In the said precedent case the date of 
death of donor was also in dispute. In PLD 1986 Lahore 
194 it was held that in a transaction of gift if revenue 
officer who attested the mutation or any other witness 
testifying the form of transaction of gift is not produced 
it is fatal…………..Neither in the written statement nor 
in the evidence, defendants have particularized the date 
of offer, acceptance and transfer of possession to them 
by deceased. It is not understandable as to why the 
deceased Jalal Din could gift his land in favour of 
defendants by depriving his own legal heirs. It appears 
that at the time of making of alleged gift he was not made 
aware of the contents thereof and he was also illiterate 
person. From a bare perusal of statement of PW.1 it 
appears that at the time of making of transaction of 
alleged gift Ishaque the real maternal uncle of 
defendants was cultivating the land of deceased Jalal 
Din as his tenant and taking undue advantage of this 
fact they must have procured the transaction of gift in 
their favour.” 
   (Emphasis provided) 
Here it is worth mentioning that the contention of learned counsel for 
the petitioners that caste of deceased Jalal-ud-Din has been wrongly 
mentioned in the death certificate relied upon by the respondents and 
hence, the said death certificate being unreliable is also of no help 
inasmuch as the said ground was never taken in the written statement 
and/or in the grounds of appeal before the learned Appellate Court 
below. Even otherwise, the above referred discussion makes the said 
death certificate irrelevant since the petitioners failed to prove the 
necessary ingredients of the oral gift depriving the respondents who are 
admittedly legal heirs of deceased Jalal-ud-Din (the donor). 
11. 
Adverting to the facts of the connected Civil Revision 
No.1089/2009, it is noted that challenge was laid to order dated 
11.04.1992 statedly passed by the Revenue Officials on the strength of 
the inquiry conducted and it was concluded that deceased Jalal-ud-din 

9 
C.R. No.1090/2009 
 
 
died on 01.11.1980 and not on 06.06.1981 on the ground that the 
petitioners moved the application for correction of the register 
pertaining to deaths maintained by the Local Government/Officials 
concerned after lapse of more than a decade and the date was 
unilaterally changed from 01.11.1980 to 06.06.1981 without even 
summoning respondent No.1, namely, Muhammad Ismail who 
admittedly is the real son of deceased Jalal-ud-Din and was alive at the 
relevant point of time. Both the learned Courts below scanned the 
evidence on record and concluded that there are major contradictions in 
statement of the witnesses of the petitioners who could not 
categorically extend support to the version of the petitioners regarding 
the date of death of deceased Jalal-ud-Din and hence, the suit instituted 
by the petitioners was dismissed. This Court agrees with the reasoning 
put forth by the learned Courts below, particularly, with the ground that 
the application for correction of the date was moved by the petitioners 
after a considerable delay of more than a decade, once challenge was 
laid by the respondents to the impugned mutation and said ground 
alone is sufficient to disbelieve the stance of the petitioners. In this 
regard, it is also imperative to note that deceased Muhammad 
Rasheed/plaintiff No.1 appeared as PW-3 and when cross-examined, 
stated as under: 
’’ب ب وکیئ صخش وفت وہ اجےئ وت اس یک وافت اک ادنراج اےکس رسپان رکواےت ںیہ
ج ۔ الجل یک وافت اک ادنراج

(Emphasis provided) 
 
While appraising the evidence in general and above quoted part of 
statement of PW-3 in particular, the learned Trial Court held as under: 
“7…..Issues No.1 & 2 
……..The death certificate on which claim of plaintiffs is 
based shows the date of death of deceased to be 6-6-81 
which was found to be bogus and fictitious entry 
manipulated by plaintiff in connivance with the concerned 
Secretary U.C. It is an admitted fact that at the time when 
death entry of deceased 6-6-81 was got recorded, the death 

10 
C.R. No.1090/2009 
 
 
entry of deceased as 1-11-80 was already got recorded. In 
these circumstances it can safely be concluded that plaintiffs 
have miserably failed to prove these issues. These issues are 
decided in the negative.”  
(Emphasis provided) 
12. 
In view of the above discussion, this Court is of the opinion that 
the concurrent findings of the learned Courts below in present as well 
as in connected Civil Revision No.1089/2009 are supported by cogent 
reasons and rendered after proper appraisal of factual as well as 
evidentiary resume of the cases and by correct application of law, 
which does not merit interference in revisional jurisdiction by this 
Court as no misreading, non-reading, procedural impropriety or 
jurisdictional defect could be pointed out by the petitioners.  As a 
natural corollary, both the Civil Revisions fail and are hereby 
dismissed. No order as to costs.
