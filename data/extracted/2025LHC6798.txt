Feeling aggrieved by the judgment of trial court, Nauman Ijaz, the 
appellant, has assailed his conviction and sentence by filing the instant appeal 
bearing Criminal Appeal No.30048-J of 2022. The learned trial court also sent 
M.R. No.109 of 2022 (The State vs. Nauman Ijaz) to confirm the death 
sentence awarded to the appellant, Nauman Ijaz. It is pertinent to mention 
here that the complainant also filed a Crl. Appeal No.30043 of 2022 against the 
acquittal of respondents No.1 and 2. All the matters arising from the same 
judgment of the trial court are being disposed of through a single judgment. 
3. 
 
The prosecution story as alleged in the F.I.R (Ex. PB) lodged on the 
application (Ex.PE) of Muhammad Asim (PW-5)-the complainant is that on 
14.12.2019, at about 12:00 Noon, the complainant (PW-5) along with his 
brother, Mohsin Raza (since dead) and Muhammad Shafique (PW-6) were 
present in the room of the house. Suddenly, the accused, Nauman Ijaz, along 
with an unknown accused person, while armed with their respective weapons, 
entered the house. Upon seeing the complainant party, the accused, Nauman 
Ijaz, raised a lalkara and made a fire shot which hit the right side of the abdomen 
of Mohsin Raza (since dead). The accused, Nauman Ijaz, made a second fire 
which landed on the left side of the belly of Mohsin Raza (since dead). 
Thereafter, the accused, Nauman Ijaz, made a third fire, which hit the left leg 
near the knee joint of Mohsin Raza (since dead), whereupon Mohsin Raza (since 
dead) fell. After that, the accused persons decamped from the place of 
occurrence while making aerial firing. The complainant (PW-5) and Muhammad 
Shafique (PW-6) took Mohsin Raza (since dead) to the hospital in an injured 
condition.  
4. 
 
The motive behind the occurrence was that accused-Nauman Ijaz, 
used to tease the daughter of Muhammad Shafique, namely, Iqra, and when the 
brother of the complainant, Mohsin Raza (since dead), forbade him, he bore a 
grudge against Mohsin Raza (since dead), and resultantly, the alleged occurrence 
took place.

5. 
 
On 17.12.2019, Ali Akbar, A.S.I (PW-11) received information that 
Mohsin Raza, the injured, died at Allied Hospital, Faisalabad, whereupon he 
(PW-11) entered this information in the rapt Rozmancha vide rapt No.11, and 
altered the offence under section 324 PPC into an offence under section 302 
PPC.  
6. 
 
After registration of the case, the investigation of this case was 
conducted by Atique-ur-Rehman, S.I. (PW-10), who arrested the accused on 
04.01.2020, and having found him guilty, prepared a challan under section 173 
Cr.P.C. and sent the same to the court of competent jurisdiction while placing 
the names of all accused persons in Column No.3 of the challan. On 23.10.2020, 
the trial court formally charge-sheeted the appellant, to which he pleaded not 
guilty and claimed trial. In support of its version, the prosecution produced as 
many as fourteen (14) witnesses.  
7. 
 
After the closure of prosecution evidence, the appellant was 
examined under Section 342 of Cr.P.C., wherein neither he opted to appear as 
his own witness in terms of Section 340 (2) Cr.P.C. nor to produce any evidence 
in his defence. In response to a particular question that why this case was against 
him and why the PWs had deposed against him, the appellant-Nauman Ijaz, 
made the following deposition: - 
“It has come in the evidence of prosecution witnesses 
that Iqra PW daughter of Shafique PW was a trainee in 
a beauty parlor situated at a distance of 2 or 3 streets 
from the house of Shafique PW. The parents of Iqra and 
also her brother Zahid were against her training. 
Moreover, Tayyaba sister of Iqra PW was allegedly 
abducted and case F.I.R. No.508/19, dated 01.05.2019, 
under sections 365-B, 376, 148, 149 PPC, police station, 
Raza Abad was registered on the instance of Mst. 
Nasreen 
wife 
of 
Shafique 
PW. 
Due 
to 
these 
circumstances, the relatives and some of their opponents 
were deadly against the family of Shafique PW. The 
complainant Muhammad Asim and her deceased 
brother Mohsin are not relatives of Muhammad 
Shafique PW but despite that they used to visit them 
frequently. Neither Shafique PW nor Zahid, brother of 
Iqra initiated for registration of this case, despite the fact

Crl. Appeal No.30048-J of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No.30043 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
4 
that occurrence allegedly took place in their house. 
Rather it was registered on the application of Asim PW 
who is resident of Mullan Pur Chak No.77/JB (as per his 
CNIC), situated at a distance of about 25 KM. There is 
no conflict between the family of Nauman Ijaz and 
Muhammad Shafique PW. The complainant has 
involved innocent Nauman Ijaz accused just to save their 
honour, in connivance with police, as the actual culprit 
could not be traced. Neither the PWs nor the accused 
were present on the spot on the alleged day of and time 
of occurrence.”  
8. 
 
After recording evidence and evaluating the evidence available on 
record in the light of the arguments advanced by both sides, the trial court found 
the prosecution version proved beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt, which 
resulted in the appellant’s conviction in the afore-stated terms. 
9. 
 
 We have heard the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for 
the parties and have minutely perused the record on the file. 
10. 
 
In the instant case, the occurrence took place on 14.12.2019 at 
about 1.15 p.m., whereas the distance between the place of occurrence and the 
police station is one (1) kilometer. Whereas in the instant case incident was not 
reported at the Police Station, rather Ali Akbar ASI (PW-11) met Muhammad 
Asim (PW-5), complainant at Allied Hospital, Faisalabad, at 1:15 p.m., who 
received the complaint (Ex.PE) endorsed the police “Karvai” at 1:15 p.m. on 
14.12.2019 and referred the same to Police Station through Muhammad Umair 
Aslam 6114/C (PW-12) for lodging of a formal FIR based on which Kashif Ali 
5741/MHC (PW-3) chalked out the formal FIR (Ex.PB) at 1:40 p.m. on 
14.12.2019. The entire criminal case depends on the first information recorded 
in the complaint before the police, and the entire evidence depends on that 
document. According to the prosecution, Muhammad Asim (PW-5), the 
complainant, took his brother, Mohsin Raza, to the Allied Hospital, Faisalabad, 
for medical treatment. The relevant portion of the examination-in-chief of 
Muhammad Asim (PW-5), the complainant is as under:- 
“We thereafter took our brother Mohsin Raza 
for providing him medical facility to Allied 
Hospital, Faisalabad.”

Muhammad Asim (PW-5), the complainant, deposed during cross-examination 
that:-  
“Police reached at the spot at 2:00 PM. I 
informed the police regarding the occurrence 
by making telephonic call. I made call to rescue 
15 to inform about the occurrence. After 
making call to rescue 15, Ali Akbar S.I reached 
at the hospital. Volunteered that position of my 
brother was critical that's why, we had shifted 
him to Allied Hospital. We reached hospital at 
about 10:30 PM. Application was drafted by 
computer operator, sitting outside the allied 
hospital. I signed the said application at one 
01:40/01:45 PM. Application was presented to 
Ali Akbar S.I. Ali Akbar S.I came at the spot at 
02:00 PM after his interaction with us in the 
hospital. ----- The information of the occurrence 
furnished to police by me at about 12:00 Noon 
by making a call to rescue 15. ---- Police did not 
arrive at the spot in my presence. The police 
met me for the first time after the occurrence at 
about 1/1.15 at Allied Hospital, Faisalabad. The 
police official who met me at Allied Hospital, 
Faisalabad, were Ali Akbar A.S.I and other 
constables.” 
Similarly, Muhammad Shafique (PW-6) deposed during examination-in-chief 
that:-  
“I alongwith Asim thereafter took Mohsin Raza 
for providing him medical facility to Allied 
Hospital, Faisalabad.” 
In the same lines, Iqra (PW-7) deposed during the examination-in-chief. Ali 
Akbar A.S.I. (P.W-11) deposed during his examination-in-chief that on 
receiving information of the incident, he, along with other police officials, 
reached Allied Hospital, Faisalabad, where he received a written complaint (Ex. 
PE) from Muhammad Asim (PW-5), the complainant. Ali Akbar A.S.I. (P.W-
11) deposed during cross-examination that: 
“It is correct that time on my police proceeding 
is mentioned by me is 1:15 PM.” 
Muhammad Umair Aslam 6114/C (PW-12) deposed during cross-examination 
that:-

“Ali Akbar ASI handed over to me complaint 
Exh.PE at about 01:15 PM at Allied Hospital.” 
In the light of the prosecution's evidence, it has come to record that the 
Muhammad Asim (PW-5), the complainant took his brother Mohsin Raza, the 
then injured to the Allied Hospital, Faisalabad to save his life and there he met 
Ali Akbar ASI (PW-11), the investigating officer, to whom he reported the 
incident through a written complaint (Ex.PE). This prosecution story conflicts 
with the documentary evidence. The documentary evidence, i.e., medico-legal 
certificate (Ex.PQ), shows that Mohsin Raza was taken to the Government 
General Hospital, GM Abad, Faisalabad, by his brother Sohail and Adnan Amin, 
1787/Constable, where Mohsin Raza received medical treatment. His arrival 
time is recorded as 12:20 PM in the relevant column, and his examination is 
conducted at that time. Along with this, the column in which the date of the 
police docket court order is written, FIR No. 996/2019, is mentioned. Whereas 
FIR (Ex. PB) was registered at 01:40 p.m. on 14.12.2019. Dr. Nasir Hussain 
(PW-13) deposed during examination-in-chief that on 14.12.2019 at about 12:20 
PM, he medically examined Mohsin Raza. The undisputed documentary 
evidence must prevail over the oral evidence. In the present case, the undisputed 
documentary evidence is the medico-legal certificate (Ex.PQ); therefore, the 
medico-legal certificate (Ex.PQ) should be given preference over the overall oral 
evidence of the prosecution witnesses i.e. Muhammad Asim (PW-5), the 
complainant, Muhammad Shafique (PW-6), Iqra (PW-7), Ali Akbar A.S.I. 
(P.W-11) and Muhammad Umair Aslam 6114/C (PW-12). A man may lie, but 
documents do not" is a cardinal legal principle for evaluating evidence. Dr. 
Nasir Hussain (PW-13) deposed and also mentioned in the medico-legal 
certificate (Ex.PQ) that a copy of the medico-legal certificate (Ex.PQ) was 
received by “Sohail”. Relevant portion of cross-examination of Dr. Nasir 
Hussain (PW-13) is as under:-  
“I have mentioned the name of Sohail, who 
received the MLC from me.” 
Dr. Nasir Hussain (PW-13) deposed during the cross-examination that:-

“The examinee was vitally unstable and semi-
conscious state. The examinee was in critical 
condition at that time.” 
Ali Akbar, A.S.I. (P.W-11), the investigating officer, deposed during his 
testimony that he recorded the dying declaration of Mohsin Raza, who was then 
injured. He (PW-11) deposed that upon receiving information of the occurrence, 
he went to the Allied Hospital, Faisalabad; After receiving a written complaint 
(Ex. PE), he sent it to the police station at 01:15 p.m. on 14.12.2019; After that, 
he proceeded to the place of the occurrence, securing blood through cotton from 
the place of the occurrence, five crime empties P5/1-5 of pistol 30-bore, 
prepared recovery memos, and recorded statements of the prosecution witnesses 
regarding recovery proceedings; and on the same day he (PW-11) recorded 
statement of Mohsin Raza, then injured. From the deposition of Ali Akbar A.S.I. 
(P.W-11), the investigating officer, it reveals that he recorded the statement of 
Mohsin Raza on the same day after visiting the place of occurrence. Ali Akbar 
A.S.I. (P.W-11), the investigating officer, deposed during the cross-examination 
that:- 
“I did not seek information from Doctor before 
recording the statement of injured Muhammad Asim. 
I recorded the statement of injured Mohsin Raza at 
Allied Hospital, Faisalabad outside the emergency.” 
11.  
 
From the above deposition of Ali Akbar A.S.I. (P.W-11), the 
investigating officer reveals that he recorded the statement of Mohsin Raza, who 
was then injured outside the emergency of Allied Hospital, Faisalabad. Whereas 
the Anesthesia notes Ex.PS/1-42 of Allied Hospital, Faisalabad (available at 
page 200 of the paper book) reveal that Mohsin Raza, then injured, was admitted 
to the hospital on 14.12.2019 at 12:45 p.m., and UOP (stands for Urine Output) 
was started and observed from 01:00 p.m. till 08:00 p.m. The Anesthesia record 
Ex.PS/1-42 of Allied Hospital, Faisalabad (available at page 201 of the paper 
book) reveals that Mohsin Raza, then injured, was under observation since 1:00 
p.m. on 14.12.2019. In the present case, admittedly, the alleged dying 
declaration was not made to any doctor or independent witness, but only to Ali 
Akbar A.S.I. (P.W-11), the investigating officer, who, as stated above, arrived at 

M.R. No.109  of 2022

the hospital after visiting the place of occurrence and the outside emergency 
ward. When Mohsin Raza was already injured and under the supervision of the 
Anesthesia doctors from 12:45 p.m. on 14.12.2019 onward. Allied Hospital 
(FMU), Faisalabad, Accident & Emergency mortality summary Ex.PS/1-42 
(available at page 177 of the paper book) shows that the patient was transferred 
to the ICU in a shock state, with inotropic support and a ventilator. This suggests 
that Mohsin Raza was not lying outside the emergency ward, and he was in an 
unconscious condition with oxygen tubes having been inserted in his nostrils. 
Mohsin Raza was not in a fit condition to make the declaration before Ali Akbar 
A.S.I. (P.W-11), the investigating officer. The evidence of the alleged oral dying 
declaration by the deceased Mohsin Raza to Ali Akbar A.S.I. (P.W-11), the 
investigating officer relied upon by the prosecution and not accepted by the trial 
court, was, in our view, not strong, satisfactory, or convincing enough to 
establish that the deceased Mohsin Raza was in a fit condition to make an oral 
declaration to Ali Akbar A.S.I. (PW-11) before his death. In the circumstances 
mentioned above, the presence of Muhammad Asim (PW-5), the complainant at 
the place of occurrence, is highly doubtful. Muhammad Asim (PW-5), the 
complainant, deposed during examination-in-chief that he was present at the 
house of Muhammad Shafique (PW-6) with his brother, Mohsin Raza, when the 
incident occurred. Muhammad Asim (PW-5), the complainant, deposed during 
cross-examination that he used to meet Muhammad Shafique (PW-6) every day 
or after 4/5 days before the occurrence; it was his routine. But at the same time, 
he expressed his ignorance of the fact that he did not know about the teasing by 
the appellant of Iqra Bibi (7), the daughter of Muhammad Shafique (PW-6). He 
(PW-5) also deposed that in the days of the occurrence, he resided at Ghulam 
Muhammad Abad, which was at a distance from the place of the occurrence 3/3 
½ kilometers, and Muhammad Shafique (PW-5) is a friend of theirs 
(complainant and deceased). Muhammad Asim (PW-5), the complainant, 
deposed during cross-examination that:- 
“---Muhammad Shafique PW is our friend, not 
relative. House of Muhammad Shafique PW is 
situated in Street No.23, Raza Abad, Faisalabad City. 
At present we all the family members are residing in

Sadar Bazar, Ghulam Muhammad Abad. My this 
address is not mentioned in my CNIC, however, the 
address of our village Chak No.77/JB Mullanpur is 
mentioned there. At the time of occurrence, we were 
residing at Ghulam Muhammad Abad. The distance 
between the place of occurrence and the place of my 
residence at Ghulam Muhammad Abad is about 3/3 ½ 
KM. ---- There was no special occasion in the house of 
occurrence on the fateful day. --- It is not in my 
knowledge that Shafique was ever approached at any 
forum while complaining against Numan Ijaz 
regarding teaching his daughter Iqra. I also never 
complained at any forum in writing by alleging that 
accused Nauman teased Iqra daughter of my friend 
Muhammad Shafique PWs. Volunteered this fact was 
for the first time disclosed to me by Shafique PW on 
the date of occurrence, prior to the occurrence---I 
used to visit house of Shafique PW daily or after 4/5 
days prior to the occurrence. ---------- The application 
for registration of criminal case was got typed by me 
from the computer operator, sitting outside Allied 
Hospital, Faisalabad. I have not consulted with PWs 
Iqra and Shafique regarding contents of said 
application. Soon after the drafting of said application 
I told Iqra and Shafique that they have been cited as 
witnesses. I have mentioned my address at application 
Exh.PE as resident of Chak No.77/JB Mullan Pur. 
Whenever I joined the investigation I mentioned my 
same address before the police. -------- The distance 
between Raza Abad and 77/JB Mullan Pur is about 30 
to 35 KM. Place of occurrence is situated in Raza 
Abad colony. I have mentioned in my application 
Exh.PE Shafique is dear to me (Aziz).” 
Whereas Muhammad Shafique (PW-6) deposed during examination-in-chief 
about the place of residence of Muhammad Asim (PW-5), the complainant 
“----Muhammad Asim and Mohsin Raza sons of 
Mushtaq, residents of Chak No.77/JB Mullan Pur, 
Faisalabad came to meet us and we were sitting in the 
residential room of our house---” 
 
 He (PW-6) also deposed during cross-examination that: 
“----Deceased 
Mohsin 
Raza 
and 
his 
brother 
Muhammad Asim came together at the scene crime 
fifteen minutes prior to the occurrence. House of 
Muhammad Asim/complainant is at a distance of ¾

four kilometers from my house. Mohsin deceased and 
Muhammad Asim complainant were residing in the 
same house during the days of occurrence. Deceased 
was friend of my son Muhammad Zahid that is why 
we were on visiting terms. My son Muhammad Zahid 
works in motor market. ----------- My house is situated 
in a public thoroughfare. Deceased and complainant 
used to visit out house once or twice in a week and 
sometimes after a week---” 
Iqra (PW-7), an eyewitness, deposed contrary to Muhammad Asim (PW-5), the 
complainant, and Muhammad Shafique (PW-6) about the reason for the visit of 
the complainant and the deceased and her presence at the time of the occurrence. 
Iqra (PW-7), an eyewitness, deposed during cross-examination that:- 
“-----The complainant Asim and deceased Mohsin 
Raza are friend of my father and brothers---At the 
time of occurrence my elder brother was also present 
in the house namely Muhammad Zahid. The accused 
Nauman Ijaz used to tease me prior 2/3 months from 
the occurrence. I told my parents about the teasing of 
Nauman Ijaz one week prior to the occurrence. 
Neither any Punchiat was held by my father nor any 
application was filed to the police in this regard by my 
father or brother. ----------”  
She (PW-7) also deposed during cross-examination that: 
“-----On 13.12.2019 my father telephonically called 
Mohsin Raza regarding the teasing of Nauman Ijaz to 
me. For this purpose on 14.12.2019, Muhammad Asim 
and Mohsin Raza came to our house---” 
Ali Akbar A.S.I. (P.W-11), the investigating officer, deposed during the cross-
examination that:-  
“-----According to the application submitted by the 
complainant Asim the address of complainant Asim 
is mentioned as Chak No.77/GB Mullan Pur, 
Faisalabad---” 
The testimony of the prosecution witnesses revealed that the address given by 
the complainant (PW-5) regarding his residence is not supported by 
documentary evidence. In this regard, too, there is a contradiction in the 
statements of the prosecution witnesses. Muhammad Asim (PW-5), the 
complainant, stated that at the time of the incident, Iqra Bibi (PW-7) was in the 

M.R. No.109  of 2022

kitchen. There was an open window between the room wall and the kitchen, 
through which she saw the incident, while Iqra Bibi (PW-7) stated that she was 
sitting in the room where the incident occurred. Ali Akbar ASI (PW-11), the 
investigating officer, says that in the unscaled site plan (Ex. PN), he did not 
mark the point where Iqra Bibi was present. Ali Akbar ASI (PW-11), the 
investigating officer, admitted that he did not sign the unscaled site plan (Ex. 
PN); however, it is his handwriting. Ali Akbar, ASI (PW-11), the investigating 
officer, deposed during examination-in-chief that:-  
“----Stated that on 14.12.2019, I was posted as A.S.I at 
police Station Raza Abad---” 
Whereas at the bottom of the unscaled site plan (Ex. PN), it is mentioned:  
 
The scanned copy of the unscaled site plan (Ex. PN) is as follows:- 
  

M.R. No.109  of 2022

Crl. Appeal No.30043 of 2022

12.  
 
We have also noted that at the bottom of the written complaint 
(Ex.PE), the recovery memo of crime empties (Ex.PC), the recovery memo of 
blood-stained cotton (Ex.PD), Ali Akbar ASI (PW-11), the investigating officer 
mentioned his designation as “ASI”, which also throws clouds of doubt on the 
deposition of Ali Akbar ASI (PW-11), the investigating officer.  The deposition 
of the above-said prosecution witnesses established that the motive for the 
incident was also not proved, as an FIR was registered regarding the kidnapping 
of Muhammad Shafique (PW-6)’s daughter, Tayyaba, on 01.05.2019 under 
section 365-B PPC and in such circumstances if the appellant was teasing or 
harassing the second daughter, i.e., Iqra Bibi (PW-7), it was not possible to take 
this matter lightly and not report it. In the presence of a daughter's abduction 
case, the teasing or harassment of the other daughter of Muhammad Shafique 
(PW-6), which has been going on for two consecutive months, is not something 
the parents can ignore and not act against the appellant. The conflict between the 
documentary evidence and the witnesses' statements was so serious that it 
reached the root of the matter and knocked the bottom out of the prosecution's 
case. Muhammad Shafique (PW-6) deposed that the deceased was a friend of his 
son Muhammad Zahid, that is why they were on visiting terms. Muhammad 
Asim (PW-5), the complainant, deposed during cross-examination that:- 
“---Muhammad Shafique PW is our friend, not 
relative. House of Muhammad Shafique PW is 
situated in Street No.23, Raza Abad, Faisalabad City. 
At present we all the family members are residing in 
Sadar Bazar, Ghulam Muhammad Abad. My this 
address is not mentioned in my CNIC, however, the 
address of our village Chak No.77/JB Mullanpur is 
mentioned there. At the time of occurrence, we were 
residing at Ghulam Muhammad Abad. The distance 
between the place of occurrence and the place of my 
residence at Ghulam Muhammad Abad is about 3/3 ½ 
KM. -------- There was no special occasion in the 
house of occurrence on the fateful day. ---”  
13.  
 
Thus, it was established from the evidence of Muhammad Asim 
(PW-5), the complainant, and Muhammad Shafique (PW-6) that “Zahid” was a 
friend of the deceased. On the fateful day, he was present in the house; therefore, 
an adverse inference is to be drawn within the meaning of Article 129 (g) of 

M.R. No.109  of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No.30048-J of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No.30043 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
13 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, that had “Zahid”, been joined in the 
investigation and appeared in court as a witness. His testimony would have been 
unfavorable to the prosecution.  Reliance is placed on a case reported as “The 
State and others   v.  Abdul Khaliq and others” (PLD 2011 SC 554). 
14.  
 
Moreover, there are sufficient contradictions, improvements, 
discrepancies, and omissions regarding the mode and manner of the occurrence 
at the relevant time. Iqra Bibi (PW-7), during the course of cross-examination, 
deposed as under:- 
“---I did not get recorded in my statement under 
section 161 Cr.P.C before the Investigating Officer 
that we were sitting in the residential room of our 
house. I got recorded in my statement under section 
161 Cr.P.C that the second fire of accused Nauman 
Ijaz was hit on the left side of his abdomen. 
Confronted with Exh.DA where the word “left” is not 
mentioned. I got recorded in my statement that the 
third fire shot made by accused Nauman Ijaz hit the 
Mohsin Raza deceased on the left leg near the knee 
joint. Confronted with Exh.DA where the word “knee 
joint” is not mentioned. I got recorded in my 
statement under section 161 Cr.P.C the time and date 
of occurrence is not mentioned---Both the accused 
Nauman Ijaz and Zubair manage to escape from the 
place of occurrence while riding on the motorcycle of 
accused Aftab. Confronted with Ex.DA where the 
name of the accused persons are not mentioned.------”  
15.  
 
Thus, it becomes clear that there are significant contradictions in 
the alleged eyewitness's statement. In such circumstances, the presence of the 
alleged eyewitness at the spot seems doubtful. The story narrated by the 
prosecution witness becomes wholly doubtful, and she cannot be believed. 
However, based on the alleged eyewitnesses' testimony, the trial court erred in 
convicting the accused-appellant. The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the 
case of “Muhammad Rafique and others   v.  The State and others” (2010 
SCMR 385) held as under:- 
“This Court in the case of Saeed Muhammad Shah v. 
State 1993 SCMR 550 observed that if a witness 
improves his statement on material aspects of the case 

M.R. No.109  of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No.30048-J of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No.30043 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
14 
then such improvement is not worthy of reliance and 
the evidence of such witness requires corroboration. In 
the case of Khalid Javed  v.  State 2003 SCMR 1419 
while reiterating the above rule, it was further observed 
that such witness is to be considered to be wholly 
unreliable and it is not advisable to place explicit 
reliance upon his evidence.” 
16.  
 
This also casts doubt on the authenticity of the versions given by 
Muhammad Asim (PW-5), the complainant, Muhammad Shafique (PW-6), and 
Iqra Bibi (PW-7).   
17.  
 
As regards the recovery of the pistol 30-bore (P-3) along with four 
alive bullets (P-4), the only incriminating evidence, on the disclosure and 
pointing of the appellant-Nauman Ijaz and positive report of Punjab Forensic 
Science Agency (Ex.PU) is concerned, we have noted that the pistol 30-bore (P-
3) was recovered on 12.01.2020 from one house situated at Mohallah Madina 
Park and same was secured through recovery memo (Ex-PL) was deposited with 
the Kashif Ali 5741/MHC (PW-3) of Police Station for its safe custody in the 
Malkhana on 14.01.2020. Similarly, Ali Akbar ASI (PW-11), the investigating 
officer, secured five crime empties (P5/1-5) on 14.12.2019 and handed them 
over to Kashif Ali 5741/MHC (PW-3). Kashif Ali 5741/MHC (PW-3) handed 
over a parcel said to contain crime empties to Muhammad Amin S.I. (PW-4) on 
19.12.2019. Kashif Ali, 5741/MHC (PW-3) deposed during examination-in-
chief that:-   
“---On 19.12.2019, a sealed parcel said to contain 
crime empties was handed over to Muhammad Amin, 
S.I. for its onward transmission to the office of 
P.F.S.A Lahore, intact---”  
Muhammad Amin S.I. (PW-4) deposed during examination-in-chief that:-   
“----Stated that on 19.12.2019, I have received a 
parcel said to contain 5 crime empties of pistol 30 
bore from the Moharrar Kashif Ali, 5741/MHC for its 
onward transmission to the office of P.F.S.A Lahore. 
The said parcel remained intact with me. The I.O 
recorded my statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C in this regard”  

M.R. No.109  of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No.30048-J of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No.30043 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
15 
Atique-Ur-Rehman S.I. (PW-10), investigating officer, deposed during 
examination-in-chief that:- 
“----On 20.12.2019, I recorded the statements of 
Muhammad Amin S.I and Kashif Ali 5741/C under 
section 161 Cr.P.C regarding bloodstained cotton and 
sealed parcel of crime empties for keeping in safe 
custody, of Malkhana as well as for its onward 
transmission to the office of P.F.S.A Lahore---”  
18.  
 
Even no evidence on record was available to show that the five 
crime empties (P5/1-5) secured on 14-12-2019 were deposited with the office of 
the Punjab Forensic Science Agency on 20-12-2019. There is no link evidence 
adduced in this case to find that the five crime empties (P5/1-5) were deposited 
by Muhammad Amin S.I. (PW-4) with the office of the Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency on 20.12.2019. The report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency 
(Ex.PU) reveals that crime empties were submitted by Muhammad Amin, S.I. 
(PW-4), on 26.12.2019. Whereas Muhammad Amin S.I. (PW-4) deposed that he 
deposited the parcel of crime empties with the Punjab Forensic Science Agency 
on 20.12.2019. So, tampering with the prosecution's evidence cannot be ruled 
out at this stage. This further creates doubt, and the prosecution's story weakens. 
We are, therefore, of the view that the recovery of pistol 30-bore (P-3) and 
positive report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency (Ex.PU) are of no avail to the 
prosecution. Accordingly, the appellant deserves to be given benefit of doubt 
and findings in this regard are to be set aside and the same are set aside.  
19.  
 
From the facts and circumstances narrated above, we are persuaded 
to hold that the prosecution has not proved its case against the accused beyond a 
reasonable doubt, as there are many gaps in the prosecution's story. In the 
present case, the possibility of the occurrence not being witnessed by both 
prosecution witnesses cannot be ruled out; as such, the conviction and sentence 
recorded by the learned trial court cannot be sustained. Reliance has been placed 
on the case reported as “Muhammad Akram  v.  The State” (2009 SCMR 230) 
wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan held that:-  
“Even a single circumstance creating reasonable doubts 
in a prudent mind about the guilt of the accused makes 

M.R. No.109  of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No.30048-J of 2022

16 
him entitled to the benefit, not as a matter of grace and 
concession but as a matter of right.” 
20.  
 
Therefore, from the evidence on record, we find that a reasonable 
doubt exists in the prosecution's version. The genesis of the occurrence has been 
concealed. The occurrence has not taken place as deposed by the PWs. The 
ocular evidence is also not proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The PWs also 
cannot be held as reliable witnesses. Therefore, giving the benefit of doubt to the 
appellant, Crl. Appeal No. 30048-J of 2022 filed by Nauman Ijaz, the 
appellant, is accepted in toto.  Resultantly, the conviction and sentence recorded 
by the learned trial court vide judgment dated 31.03.2022 is set aside, as a 
consequence whereof, the appellant-Nauman Ijaz is ordered to be acquitted of 
the charge in case F.I.R. No.996-2019, dated 14.12.2019, offences under 
sections 302, 449, 34 of P.P.C, registered at the police station, Raza Abad, 
District Faisalabad,, and he (the appellant-Nauman Ijaz) is directed to be 
released forthwith if not required in any other case.  
21.  
 
Murder Reference No.109 of 2022 is answered in the negative, 
and the sentence of death awarded to Nauman Ijaz, son of Ijaz Ahmad, Caste 
Sheikh, resident of street No.4, Kamal Abad, District Faisalabad, is not 
confirmed. 
22.  
 
As far as Crl. Appeal No. 30043 of 2022 against the acquittal of 
respondents No. 1 and 2, Aftab Ahmad and Muhammad Zubair is concerned, for 
what has been discussed above in the light of prosecution evidence, medical 
evidence, and documentary evidence, the acquittal of respondents No. 1 and 2, 
Aftab Ahmad and Muhammad Zubair, does not suffer from any illegality to call 
for the interference of this Court with the impugned judgment. We have also 
taken note of the settled principle of criminal jurisprudence that unless it can be 
shown that the lower court’s judgment is perverse or that it is entirely illegal. No 
other conclusion can be drawn except the guilt of the accused, or misreading or 
non-reading of evidence, resulting in a miscarriage of justice. Even otherwise, 
when a court of competent jurisdiction acquits the accused, the double 
presumption of innocence attaches to their case. The acquittal order cannot be 

M.R. No.109  of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No.30048-J of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No.30043 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
17 
interfered with, thereby affording an accused double the presumption of 
innocence, as held in Muhammad Mansha Kausar v. Muhammad Ashgar and 
others (2003 SCMR 477). In this case, the prosecution has not been able to 
present on record adequate incriminating evidence against respondents No. 1 
and 2, Aftab Ahmad and Muhammad Zubair, which connects them to the alleged 
crime. The learned trial Judge has advanced valid and plausible reasons for 
recording an acquittal in favor of respondents No. 1 and 2, Aftab Ahmad and 
Muhammad Zubair. The judgment of acquittal does not call for any interference. 
Consequently, we find no merit in Crl. Appeal No. 30043 of 2022 is hereby 
dismissed as being without merit.
