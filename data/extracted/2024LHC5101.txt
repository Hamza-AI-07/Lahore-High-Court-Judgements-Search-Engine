This petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 stems from letter 
dated 3rd January, 2014, whereby respondent No.2 conveyed 
the sanction of the competent Authority to the petitioner for 
conversion of lease in cantt code Form ‘B’ into regular lease 
in schedule IX-C of the Cantonments Land Administration 
Rules, 1937 (hereinafter referred to as “C.L.A, Rules, 
1937”) in respect of Bungalow No.251/A survey No.562/A 
situated at Iftkhar Janjua Road, Rawalpindi. The grouse of 
the petitioner is only related to demand of premium 
amounting to Rs.6,79,74,976/- as a condition precedent for 
the sanction. 
2. 
Facts forming background of this petition are that 
property bearing survey No.562-A situated at Iftikhar Janjua 
Road, Rawalpindi Cantt. was an evacuee property which 
was initially held on lease by Jawalla Sahe as evacuee 
lessee. After partition of the sub-continent the property 
became vested in the custodian and subsequently it was 
acquired by the Federal Government (respondent No.1). The 
property was then divided into three units i.e. Bungalows 

Writ Petition No.98 of 2014 
-2- 
 
No.251-A, 251-A/1 and 251-B. As per claim of the 
petitioner said bungalows were later on transferred to 
various persons and finally bungalow No.251-A was 
transferred on lease to her brother namely Shahid Yousaf 
from whom through gift deed the petitioner derived the lease 
hold rights. As per stance of the petitioner in order to change 
the status of bungalow from residential to commercial, she 
though moved various applications from time to time but 
respondents remained deaf ear, however, on her last 
application dated 25th May, 2011 the respondents conveyed 
the sanction for conversion of lease but she has been asked 
to deposit an amount of Rs.6,79,74,976/- on account of 
premium which is illegal. 
3. 
In their report and parawise comments respondents 
No.1 to 3 submitted that site measuring 0.493 acres 
comprising survey No.562/A known as Bungalow No.251/A 
situated at Iftikhar Janjua Road, Rawalpindi Cantt. is held on 
lease in cantt. code Form ‘B’ of 1912 by Shahid Yousaf who 
transferred the lease hold rights in favour of M/s Zahid 
Yousaf and Shahida Mansoor (petitioner) by way of oral gift 
vide declaration of gift dated 28th November, 1981. It is also 
canvassed that the lessees unauthorizedly converted the 
premises in commercial use by establishing a clinic known 
as “Zohra Nursing Home” on account of which they were 
served with notices to stop the unauthorized use of property. 
In response lessees applied for conversion of the premises 
from residential to commercial and finally sanction was 
accorded and conveyed through letter dated 3rd January, 
2014 subject to fulfillment of conditions mentioned therein, 
including deposit of premium amounting to Rs.6,79,74,976/-. 
4. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the 
petitioner is the lessee of property in question and in said 
status she applied for conversion of property from 
residential to commercial. Added that first application to this 

Writ Petition No.98 of 2014 
-3- 
 
effect was moved in the year 1983 which followed various 
applications but no positive response from the respondents. 
Learned counsel emphasized that last application to this 
effect was moved in the year 2011 upon which sanction was 
accorded and conveyed through impugned letter demanding 
premium of Rs.6,79,74,976/- which is highly unwarranted. It 
is contended with vehemence that the respondents cannot 
claim the premium at the rates when sanction was accorded 
as the application of the petitioner was pending since long. 
Learned counsel submitted that premium should be charged 
at the rate prevailing in the year 1983. 
5. 
Conversely, learned Law Officer seriously resisted 
this petition. He submitted that the amount of premium has 
been demanded as per prevailing policy and the petitioner is 
bound to pay the same. 
6. 
Heard. Record perused. 
7. 
The moot point involved herein is confined and 
restricted to the applicability of rates for premium 
chargeable from the petitioner. The claim of the petitioner is 
that as her case for conversion is pending since 1983 so the 
respondents are precluded to claim the premium at the rates 
prevailing in the year 2011. To this effect learned counsel 
for the petitioner has relied upon unreported judgment of a 
Division 
Bench 
of 
Sindh 
High 
Court 
passed 
in 
Constitutional Petitions No.D-2314 and 2315 of 2008. From 
the perusal of judgment dated 30th November, 2010 it 
evinces that claims of the petitioner in said case remained 
unresponded by the respondents therein without any reason 
or justification albeit they fulfilled all the requirements and 
in that backdrop it was held as under :- 
“14. 
In view of hereinabove facts and circumstances of this 
case, the respondents cannot be allowed to take benefit of their 
own mistakes not the petitioners can be penalized or financially 
burdened for the delay and inaction on the part of respondents. 
Since the petitioners, after complying with all the requirements 
had approached the respondents for the purposes of conversion 

Writ Petition No.98 of 2014 
-4- 
 
of their residential plots into commercial plots in terms of 
policy prevailing in the year 1996 and no deficiency or 
discrepancy was ever pointed out by the respondents in this 
regard, we are of the opinion that their cases were required to 
be processed in terms of the policy prevailing in the year 1996 
when the petitioners applied for commercialization and not in 
terms of the subsequent revised policy, as suggested by the 
respondents.” 
8. 
Now looking at the case of the petitioner it is noticed 
that the petitioner in the first instance moved an application 
for the conversion of premises from residential to 
commercial in the year 1983 which was declined on 9th June, 
1983. The petitioner thereafter moved another application in 
the year 1986 which too was not acceded to and rejected 
vide letter dated 11th March, 1989. It is an admitted position 
that petitioner did not question the orders resulting into 
rejection of application and instead moved a fresh 
application on 25th May, 2011. Admittedly the impugned 
letter is the outcome of said application. The case of the 
petitioner thus cannot be termed as pending and as such 
principles laid down in the judgment dated 30th November, 
2010 by Sindh High Court cannot be stretched into service. 
9. 
A wade through the record reveals that the petitioner 
submitted a building plan for construction of new building 
after demolition of existing structure which was approved in 
the year 1989. The petitioner after completion of new 
construction started using the building for commercial 
purpose in contravention of her own undertaking to this 
effect. This prompted the Government to resume the site and 
for the said purpose a notice was served upon the petitioner 
on 4th May, 1989. The petitioner assailed the notice by 
instituting a suit for declaration and injunction before the 
Civil Court, however, notices were withdrawn and in view 
thereof suit was disposed of as having become infructuous 
by way of judgment and decree dated 24th September, 1991. 
The petitioner though challenged the said judgment and 
decree before the learned Additional District Judge, 
Rawalpindi but of no avail, as the appeal was dismissed by 

Writ Petition No.98 of 2014 
-5- 
 
way of judgment and decree dated 30th January, 1996. In the 
above backdrop the petitioner alongwith her brother Zahid 
Yousaf being lessees applied on Schedule V dated 25th May, 
2011 alongwith site plan for conversion of cantt. code Form 
‘B’ into regular lease in schedule IX-C of the “C.L.A. Rules, 
1937” for commercial hospital purposes. The unauthorized 
construction was regularized by the Chaklala Cantonment 
Board vide letter dated 12th November, 2012 by issuing no 
objection certificate from municipal point of view subject to 
furnishing of bank guarantee worth Rs.5.0 million as 
composition fee which was submitted by the petitioner in the 
shape of pay order Barley Bank Rawalpindi. 
10. 
It is an undisputed fact that the Government of 
Pakistan Ministry of Defence in terms of power conferred 
under the “C.L.A. Rules, 1937” issued policies from time to 
time 
for 
conversion 
of 
properties 
held 
on 
old 
grant/cantonment code leases into regular leases, including 
conversion/change of purpose of regular leases into fresh 
leases. To this effect previously policy was introduced in the 
year 1996 which was then superseded by another policy in 
the year 2007. As at the time of moving of application in the 
year 2011 later i.e. Policy 2007 was in vouge so the case of 
the petitioner was considered thereunder. In terms of the 
said policy leases for Hospitals, Educational/Training 
Institutions (including Hostel facilities), Museums and 
Libraries are to be executed in schedule IX-A under “C.L.A. 
Rules, 1937” for perpetuity. Clause 2 of the policy deals 
with the change of purpose from residential to commercial, 
which reads as under :- 
“2. 
Change 
of 
Purpose 
From 
Residential 
to 
Commercial. Sites held for residential purpose may be leased 
out for commercial purpose subject to the following conditions. 
a. 
Obtaining of NOC. The following NOCs will be 
required:- 
(1) 
Sites outside Bazar Areas 
(a) 
NOC from GHQ in consultation with Service 
Headquarters concerned from military/security point of view. 

Writ Petition No.98 of 2014 
-6- 
 
(b) 
NOC of the respective Cantt Board from municipal 
point of view. 
(2) 
Sites Inside Bazar Area. NOC of the local Cantt Board 
from municipal point of view. 
b. 
Premium. 50% of the Revenue Rate (Commercial) will 
be charged for conversion from residential to commercial lease 
in Schedule IX-C. 
c. 
Ground Rent. The ground rent shall be charged at the 
rate of Rs.4/- per sq yd per annum.” 
Whereas clause 3(h) provides the procedure for dealing with 
cases of unauthorized change of purpose, in the following 
manner :- 
“h. 
Cases of Unauthorized Change of Purpose. Cases of 
unauthorized change of purpose, e.g. site for hospital/education 
purposes being used for commercial/other purposes and 
residential property being used for commercial purposes, will 
be treated as under:- 
(1) NOC. NOC shall be obtained from GHQ, through 
respective Garrison Headquarters and Station Headquarters. 
(2) Premium. Shall be charged on revenue Rate applicable for 
the said purpose. 
(3) Penalty/Composition Fee. After approval of conversion, 
respective Cantt Board to charge due composition fee as 
per the existing rules. 
(4) Resumption of Property. Those who fail to pay the 
premium and composition fee, their property shall be 
resumed.” 
In furtherance to the above policy, the Government of 
Pakistan Ministry of Defence (ML&C Deptt) through letter 
No.55/305/Lands/ MC&C/07 circulated instructions to 
Directors Military Lands and Cantonments to the following 
effect :- 
“a) 
Rate for calculation of premium and other charges shall 
be charged as applicable on the date of issue of final approval 
by the Competent authority. 
b) 
A check list/complete details of documents required to 
process 
the 
case 
shall 
be 
handed 
over 
to 
the 
applicant/lessee/grantee at the time of issue of Schedule V of 
the CLA Rules 1937. 
c) 
All CEOs be asked to complete the zoning of the 
Cantonment through Station HQs within three months from the 
date of issue of this letter.” 
(Underlining supplied for emphasis) 
11. 
In the wake of above discussion it can safely be held 
that after rejection of previous applications when the 
petitioner instead of challenging the orders of rejection 
opted to apply afresh in the year 2011, so her case would 
clearly fall under the policy 2007. The petitioner is thus 

Writ Petition No.98 of 2014 
-7- 
 
precluded to claim the benefits of previous policy. In other 
words, petitioner cannot be benefited for her own wrongs. 
Reference to this effect can be made to Mst. SAEEDA BANO 
SIDDIQUI 
versus 
CANTONMENT 
EXECUTIVE 
OFFICER, 
CANTONMENT BOARD MALIR, KARACHI (2018 SCMR 1616). 
12. 
The nutshell of above discussion is that though the 
petitioner is claiming equitable relief but her petition is 
founded on concealment/withholding of material facts as 
narrated in preceding para 9. Even otherwise there is no 
vested right of the petitioner to bring her cause under a 
policy favourable to her, which is even not in existence. 
Resultantly this petition being devoid of any merits is 
dismissed in limine.
