JUDGMENT. 
 
  
 
 
 
Mirza Viqas Rauf, J. The petitioner namely Muhammad 
Usman Farooq having lustrous educational record after completing his 
higher secondary school education from Army Public School & College, 
Ordinance Road, Rawalpindi obtaining 1066 marks out of total 1100 with 
Grade A-1 appeared in the Medical & Dental College Admission Test 
(hereinafter referred to as “MDCAT”) for Bachelor of Medicine and 
Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS). In the test, the petitioner secured 188 marks 
out of 200 and was ranked overall 95th in the merit list and was placed at 
serial No.45 in the list of Rawalpindi Medical University on merit list with 
an aggregate percentage of 95.7182.  The petitioner thus chose Rawalpindi 
Medical University on his priority and deposited admission fee for first 
year MBBS sessions 2022-23 on 28th December, 2022. The grievance of the 
petitioner is that Rawalpindi Medical University issued call letter to him on 
25th January, 2023 whereby he was directed to report on 24th January, 
2023. The petitioner though reported but he was not allowed admission 
and was replaced with other students, who were below in the merit. To this 
Date of hearing:

effect, a representation was moved by the petitioner to the Vice Chancellor 
of the Rawalpindi Medical University but of no avail. Through instant 
petition, the petitioner is now seeking a direction to the respondents to give 
him admission in the first year of MBBS Session 2022-23 in Rawalpindi 
Medical University against open merit list.  
2.  
This petition was admitted for regular hearing vide order dated 
29th March, 2023. In response thereof, the respondents submitted their 
written statements wherein it is stance of respondent No.1 that after the 
start of admission process, a list of 322 candidates was received by the 
Rawalpindi Medical University from the University of Health Sciences, 
Lahore/respondent No.2. On 13th January, 2023 the information of all the 
selected candidates for admission in Rawalpindi Medical University, 
Rawalpindi was uploaded on University’s Website, regarding instructions 
for admission process/prerequisites/list of original documents to be 
presented for admission. On 21st January, 2023, respondent No.1 also 
issued call letters to those students who had not reported till 21st January, 
2023 as per instructions contained in prospectus for the sessions 2022-23 
by University of Health Sciences wherein the students were directed to 
report to Rawalpindi Medical University with their original documents 
latest by 24th January, 2023. It is stance of respondent No.1 that the 
petitioner was also intimated through letter dated 21st January, 2023. On 
26th January, 2023, University of Health Sciences, Lahore directed the 
Rawalpindi Medical University to submit the list of unreported students till 
closing hours, which was forwarded accordingly on the same date 
depicting the name of the petitioner as well. 
 3.  
On the other hand, stance of the University of Health Sciences, 
Lahore (respondent No.2) is that the petitioner since failed to report to the 
concerned University and deposit the original documents in accordance 
with the provisions of the prospectus for admission, thus he was excluded 
from the admission process. 

3 
 
 
 
W.P.No.1132 of 2023 
 
 
 
4.  
I have heard learned counsel for the petitioner as well as 
learned counsel for the respondents universities at considerable length and 
perused the record. 
5.  
There is no denial to the fact that the petitioner has earned 
distinctions in his short educational career and after completing his higher 
secondary school education with overwhelming aggregate of 96.90 %, he 
appeared in the “MDCAT” and obtained 188 marks out of 200. The 
petitioner, in view thereof, was placed at serial No.95 on open merit 
category test list by the University of Health Sciences and 45 in Rawalpindi 
Medical University open merit list with an aggregate percentage of 
95.7182. As per his ranking, the petitioner opted for his admission in 
Rawalpindi Medical University and deposited admission fee for the first 
year MBBS Session 2022-23 on 28th December, 2022. All these facts are 
not in dispute. The petitioner is denied the admission solely on the ground 
that on the target date, he failed to produce all the original documents 
himself as was required under the MBBS & BDS Prospectus for admission 
to Government Medical & Dental Institutions of Punjab issued by the 
University of Health Sciences, Lahore for session 2002-23 and instead his 
father presented photocopies of the required documents.  
6.  
In the prospectus, a detailed procedure and conditions of 
admission are enumerated. Serial No.5 of the procedure and conditions of 
admission deals with joining of selected candidates, which is reproduced 
below: - 
 
 
 
5. 
Joining of Selected Candidates: 
i. 
Candidates selected for admission shall be 
informed through SMS/Email. The candidates 
are advised to be vigilant and carefully check 
their email messages. 
ii. 
Selected candidates will be required to download 
their college fee challan from the application 
portal generated by the BOP. They will be 
required to deposit the college fee in the nearest 
branch of BOP by due date mentioned on their 
fee challan. They can deposit the fee manually 
as well through online transaction. The 

4 
 
 
 
W.P.No.1132 of 2023 
 
 
 
candidates are not required to visit their 
respective colleges to deposit their fee. 
ii. 
Those who fail to deposit their college fee within 
due 
date 
shall 
be 
excluded 
from 
the 
admission/upgradation process and shall have 
no right of admission into the said programme 
in the current session. 
Bare perusal of the clause-i clearly manifests that a candidate who is 
selected for admission shall be informed through short message service 
(SMS)/Email. In compliance of the above condition, the petitioner was 
informed through letter dated 21st March, 2023, which was actually letter 
dated 21st January, 2023 whereby target date was also wrongly mentioned 
as 24th January, 2022, which was actually 24th January, 2023. This letter 
was dispatched on 25th January, 2023 and delivered on 26th January, 2023. 
A SMS was though conveyed to the petitioner on 24th January, 2023 at 
12:58 pm as is evident from page 21 of the petition, which was even not 
seriously refuted by the respondents. It is thus evident without any hint of 
doubt that the petitioner was informed at the last moment and apparently it 
was impossible for him to meet with the requirements for the admission. 
Apparently, there was no fault on the part of petitioner but he was 
penalized stringently.  
7.  
There is no cavil that ordinarily courts exercise restraint in 
interfering with the internal governance and affairs of the educational 
institutions and keep their hands-off educational matters and avoid 
dislodging decision of the university authorities but this is not a rule of 
universal application though it may be followed generally. Reference to 
this effect can be made to YASIR NAWAZ and others v. HIGHER 
EDUCATION COMMISSION and others (PLD 2021 Supreme Court 745). 
Relevant extract from the same is reproduced below: - 
“9. 
Beside, the decision taken by the HEC is a policy one, 
and by now it is settled law in various jurisdictions that 
Courts should generally refrain from interfering in policy 
decisions taken by statutory bodies and authorities tasked with 
running the affairs of educational institutions and students, 
like the HEC. The rationale for the same is that matters of an 
academic nature necessitate the need for technical and 
professional expertise which may only be attained as a result 

5 
 
 
 
W.P.No.1132 of 2023 
 
 
 
of specialization and the experience of working with and in 
educational institutions. Courts are neither equipped with 
such expertise, nor do they possess the relevant experience 
that would allow for interference in such matters. However, it 
does not mean that the Courts would not step in at the request 
of the parties to ensure and ascertain whether or not minimum 
requirements of natural justice and principles of law have 
been complied with and whether a case of grave injustice has 
been made out. Also in cases where a principle of law has to 
be interpreted, applied or enforced with reference to or 
connected with education, the Courts would not hesitate in 
stepping in. Reference can readily be made to the cases of 
Muhammad Ilyas v. Bahauddin Zakariya University (2005 
SCMR 961), Noor Muhammad Khan Marwat v. Vice-
Chancellor (PLD 2001 SC 219) and Maharashtra State Board 
v. Paritosh Bhupeshkumar Sheth and others (AIR 1984 SC 
1543).” 
8.  
To this effect, case of FAKHERYAR KHAN v. AGRICULTURE 
UNIVERSITY, PESHAWAR through Vice Chancellor and 6 others (PLD 
2016 Peshawar 266) is also relevant wherein a Division Bench of 
Peshawar High Court held as under: - 
“5. 
The Prospectus framed by public educational institutions 
is essentially administrative policy statement of the respective 
institution. The settled judicial trend is to exercise judicial 
restraint in interfering with matters dealing with such policy 
decisions of educational institutions. Some of the leading cases 
in this regard are Rana Aamer Raza Ashfaq's case (2012 SCMR 
6), Government College University Lahore's case (2015 SCMR 
445), Amna Sharif's case (2015 MLD 220) and Muhammad 
Abdullah Riaz's case (PLD 2011 Lahore 555). 
6. 
This general rule of judicial restraint cannot be held to 
be absolute. Exceptions are always there, especially, when the 
impugned action or in action of the education institutions is 
'ultra vires, mala fide' or against the fundamental rights of a 
citizen or even when the same offends the principle of 
reasonability.” 
Reliance can also be placed on FATIMA NADEEM V. PROVINCE OF 
THE PUNJAB and others (2022 MLD 1922) and TARIQ MAHMOOD v. 
VICE-CHANCELLOR, UNIVERSITY OF THE PUNJAB, LAHORE and 
another (2022 MLD 155). 
9.  
In the present case, the petitioner duly qualified the “MDCAT” 
and was on open merit list but due to late intimation by the University 
itself, he was deprived of his fundamental right to education as guaranteed 

6 
 
 
 
W.P.No.1132 of 2023 
 
 
 
under article 25-A of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973. The petitioner has thus duly made his case for issuance of writ to the 
respondents. Resultantly, this petition is allowed and respondents are 
directed to give admission to the petitioner in first year of MBBS sessions 
2022-23. No order as to costs.
