Date of hearing:     17.04.2024.                                                     
Petitioner by: 
Malik Muhammad Tariq Rajwana, 
Advocate. 
Respondents by: 
Rana Ghulam Hussain, Assistant Attorney 
General along with Shahzad Ali, Assistant 
and Malik Imdad Hussain, Assistant, NIRC.  
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.:- 
Through instant petition, petitioner has sought direction from this 
Court for the respondents to pay the perks and privileges / pay and 
allowances to petitioner as are being paid to the other Members of the 
National Industrial Relations Commission (“NIRC”), especially the 
District & Sessions Judges in other provinces.  
2. 
Learned counsel for petitioner submits that petitioner, who is 
performing his duties as Member NIRC, is being discriminated in 
respect of perks and privileges given to the other Members of the 
NIRC posted at other stations and in other provinces in violation of the 
equality clause contained in Article 25 of the Constitution of the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. He argues that the impugned 
actions of respondents not allowing the perks and privileges to the 
petitioner as per qualification of petitioner required for appointment for 
the post in accordance with Rule 5(a), (d) of the Appointment of 
Chairman and Members (Qualifications) Rules, 2022, are absolutely 
illegal and without lawful justification. In support of his submissions, 
he has referred to Government of the Punjab through Secretary, 

 
2 
Writ Petition No.15368 of 2023 
 
Finance Department, Lahore v. Mubarik Ali Khan and 8 others (PLD 
1993 Supreme Court 375), Government of the Punjab through Chief 
Secretary, Civil Secretariat, Lahore and 2 others v. Syed Riaz Ali Zaidi 
[2016 PLC (C.S.) 1074], Abdul Haleem Siddiqui and others v. 
Federation of Pakistan through the Law Secretary, Ministry of Law 
and Justice, Pakistan Secretariat, Islamabad and others [2019 PLC 
(C.S.) 238] and Muhammad Wassay Tareen v. Government of 
Balochistan through Chief Secretary and 2 others [2023 PLC (C.S.) 
457].  
3. 
On the other hand, learned Law Officer has vehemently opposed 
the above submissions by contending that petitioner is being provided 
the perks and privileges of BS-21 (initial appointment) with the 
approval of Finance Division, as he has not tendered any regular 
service in the Government Establishment / offices as per available 
record, therefore, he can only be allowed perks and privileges in terms 
of the contract agreement.  
4. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused.  
5. 
Record shows that petitioner was appointed as Member (BS-21), 
NIRC on contract basis for a period of three years or till attaining the 
age of sixty-five years, whichever is earlier vide notification dated 
30.04.2023, issued by  the Government of Pakistan, Ministry of 
Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development, along with 
others, namely Syed Noor-ul-Hussnain, Abdul Ghani, Muhammad 
Siraj-ul-Islam Khan, Abdul Qayyum, Sohail Ikram, Muhammad Zubair 
Khan and Shabbir Hussain Awan on same terms and conditions.  
6. 
It is the stance of petitioner that he is being treated differently in 
respect of perks and privileges given to the other Members of the 
NIRC; and that at the time of appointment, it was agreed by 
respondents No. 3 & 4 that they will make payment of pay & 
allowances to the petitioner as per the pay & allowances of sitting 
senior District & Sessions Judges of the respective provinces, however, 
while issuing agreement, pay and allowances of non-judicial officers 
have been introduced; that petitioner was appointed along with retired 

 
3 
Writ Petition No.15368 of 2023 
 
District & Sessions Judges and their pay and allowances have been 
fixed as per the pay and allowances they were lastly receiving, 
however, petitioner is being discriminated in the matter qua his perks 
and privileges. In support, he has annexed salary slips of similarly 
placed other persons, namely Muhammad Zubair Khan and Shabbir 
Hussain along with his own, which prima facie establishes difference 
between their pay and allowances.  
7. 
The Constitution requires that public functionaries, deriving 
authority from or under the law, are obliged to act justly, fairly, 
equitably, reasonably, without any element of discrimination and 
squarely within the parameters of law, as applicable in a given 
situation. Any deviation therefrom can be corrected through 
appropriate orders under Article 199 of the Constitution. Reliance is 
placed upon Abdul Malik v. Director General (D.G.) Quetta 
Development Authority (QDA) and another [2023 PLC (C.S.) Note 
63] and Saleem Ahmad v. Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 
through Secretary Elementary and Secondary Education and others 
[2023 PLC (C.S.) 1043].  
8.  
Although Article 25 of the Constitution allows for differential 
treatment of persons who are not similarly placed under a reasonable 
classification, however, in order to justify this difference in 
treatment the reasonable classification must be based on intelligible 
differentia that has a rational nexus with the object being sought to 
be achieved. The term “reasonable” was explained and elaborated by 
the Supreme Court of Pakistan Muhammad Nasir Mahmood and 
another v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Ministry of 
Law, Justice and Human Rights Division, Islamabad (PLD 2009 
Supreme Court 107) wherein the august Supreme Court while 
elaborating the dictionary meaning of the term observed that the 
dictionary meaning of the word `reasonable' is just, proper, fair, 
equitable, and that which is acceptable to a man of common 
prudence and that of the word `unreasonable' i.e. unjust, unfair and 
that which is not acceptable to a man of ordinary prudence. This 

 
4 
Writ Petition No.15368 of 2023 
 
means that any distinct treatment meted out to a class of persons can 
only be sustained under Article 25 if the aforesaid test is satisfied. 
Reliance is also placed upon Hadayat Ullah and others v. 
Federation of Pakistan and others (2022 SCMR 1691). Similarly, it 
is well settled that in order to establish a reasonable classification 
based on intelligible differentia, the differentiation must have been 
understood logically and there should not be any artificial grouping 
for specific purpose causing injustice to other similarly placed 
individuals. In Syed Azam Shah v. Federation of Pakistan through 
Secretary Cabinet Division, Cabinet Secretariat, Islamabad and 
another (2022 SCMR 201), the Supreme Court of Pakistan further 
held that the concept of reasonableness is rationally a fundamental 
component of equality or non-arbitrariness. This very question was 
earlier elaborated by the Supreme Court in the case of Dr. Mobashir 
Hassan v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2010 Supreme Court 265), 
wherein the Court held that intelligible differentia distinguishes 
persons or things from the other persons or things, who have been 
left out. The Court held that the definition of classification 
"intelligible differentia" means differentiating between two sets of 
the people or objects, all such differentiations should be easily 
understood and should not be artificial. Similarly in the case of 
Secretary Economic Affairs Division, Islamabad and others v. 
Anwarul Haq Ahmed and others (2013 SCMR 1687), the Supreme 
Court further held that by now it is well settled that equality clause 
does not prohibit classification for those differently circumstanced 
provided a rational standard is laid down. The Supreme Court 
further held in the case of Muhammad Shabbir Ahmed Nasir v. 
Secretary, Finance Division, Islamabad and another (1997 SCMR 
1026), that a law applying to one person or one class of persons may 
be Constitutionally valid if there is sufficient basis or reason for it 
but a classification which is arbitrary and is not founded on any 
rational basis is no classification as to warrant its exclusion from the 
mischief of Article 25. It has been further elucidated in Government 

 
5 
Writ Petition No.15368 of 2023 
 
of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through Chief Secretary and others v. Syed 
Sadiq Shah and others (2021 SCMR 747) that it must always rest 
upon some real and substantial distinction bearing a just and 
reasonable relation to the object sought to be achieved by the 
authority. The Court further held that Article 25 forbids class 
legislation but it does not forbid classification or differentiation 
which rests upon reasonable grounds of distinction. The 
classification however must not be arbitrary, artificial or evasive but 
must be based on some real and substantial bearing, a just and 
reasonable relation to the object sought to be achieved by the 
legislation. The Court also held that in order to pass the test of 
reasonableness there must be a substantial basis for making the 
classification and there should be a nexus between the basis of 
classification and the object of action under consideration based 
upon justiciable reasoning.  
9. 
Petitioner had legitimate expectancy to receive the same perks 
and privileges as were being granted to similarly placed other persons / 
colleagues. In judgment dated 19.10.2016, passed by another learned 
Bench of this Court in W.P. No. 15184  of 2013, it was settled that 
there would be no discrimination regarding allowances paid to regular 
judicial officers and advocates appointed on contracts against same 
judicial posts. Even, the revised terms & conditions conveyed vide 
letter dated 11.02.2022 clearly stipulated that the incumbents will draw 
pay / allowances and emoluments at the last stage of BS-21 “alongwith 
all admissible allowances including special judicial allowance under 
the rules”. This term clearly means all admissible allowances to regular 
judicial officers in same grade would be admissible to the petitioner. 
Petitioner was appointed against the judicial post having requisite 
qualification and practice as an advocate and as such, he could not 
have been discriminated for the perks and privileges being paid to 
other appointees / Members of NIRC, who were retired District & 
Sessions Judges. It is manifestly clear from the pay slips annexed by 
petitioner in this regard that petitioner is being treated differently as 

 
6 
Writ Petition No.15368 of 2023 
 
compared to his colleagues, which is absolutely unwarranted under the 
equality clause contained in Article 25 of the Constitution of the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973.  
10. 
At this stage, learned counsel for petitioner submits that the issue 
raised through instant petition has already been resolved by learned 
Division Bench of the Hon’ble High Court of Balochistan, Quetta vide 
judgment dated 18.03.2022, passed in C.P. No.384 of 2020 titled 
Muhammad Ishaque Notezai v. Government of Pakistan, Establishment 
Division, Cabinet Secretariat, Islamabad through its Secretary & 
others, therefore, petitioner, being a similarly placed person, is entitled 
to the same relief.  
 
For facility of reference, operative part of afore-referred 
judgment is reproduced hereunder:- 
“15. 
According to the detailed difference between the pay 
and allowances of the petitioner and that of other members 
of NIRC, the petitioner received Basic Pay of Rs. 81,720/- 
while the member of NIRC Multan Bench who was appointed 
on the same date received Basic Pay of Rs. 136,720/-. The 
petitioner received Rs. 77,640/- as a special judicial 
allowance while the member of NIRC Multan Bench received 
Rs. 145,080/-. The petitioner received a Medical Allowance 
of Rs. 4353/- but on the other hand, the member of NIRC 
Multan Bench received Rs. 5087/-. The petitioner’s Adhoc 
Relief Allowance of 2017 was Rs. 8172/- whereas the 
member of NIRC Multan Bench received Rs. 13,672/- as 
Adhoc Relief Allowance of 2017.  
16. 
The above is sufficient to make it clear that the 
petitioner is being discriminated against with a person 
similarly placed in other provinces. It is a matter of record 
that the petitioner was appointed on the same terms and 
conditions of service as that of the members of NIRC of 
other provinces. Thus, the learned AAG would not be legally 
justified in opposing the instant relief.  
 
Under such circumstances, the petitioner is also 
entitled to the allowance equivalent to that paid to the 
member at Multan Bench of the NIRC.  
 
For the above reasons and to avoid disparity of the 
pay and other allowances of the employees of the same 
class, the instant petition is partly allowed. Consequently, the 
petitioner is held entitled to receive Basic Pay of Rs. 
136,720/- instead of Rs. 81,720/-, the allowances, i.e. 
Special Judicial Allowance (Rs. 145,080/- instead of Rs. 
77,640/-), Medical Allowance (Rs. 5087/- instead of  Rs. 
4353/-) and Adhoc Relief of 2017 (Rs. 13,672/- instead of 
Rs. 8172/-) equal to that of Member of NIRC Multan Bench 
as mentioned hereinabove. The respondents are directed to 

 
7 
Writ Petition No.15368 of 2023 
 
pay the arrears of the above allowances to the petitioner 
accordingly.” 
 
11. 
In the instant case, there is no reasonable distinction between 
the petitioner and other similarly placed individuals mentioned 
above and there is no justified reason to isolate the case of the 
petitioner from the said other similarly placed individuals because 
the discrimination met with the petitioner is not based on any rational 
ground or reasonable classification rather it is tantamount to creating 
artificial grouping. In view of the above, instant petition is allowed and 
petitioner is held entitled to receive perks and privileges equal to the 
similarly placed other Members of the NIRC. The respondents are 
directed to pay the arrears of the above allowances to the petitioner 
accordingly.
