Petitioner 
represented by:

State by: 
Mr. Zafar Iqbal Awan, Additional Advocate General. 
 
 
  SADIQ MAHMUD KHURRAM, J.- Through this petition filed under 
Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
the following prayer has been made:- 
“Under the above circumstances, it is, therefore, humbly prayed 
that by accepting instant writ petition, the impugned order dated 
30.03.2022 passed by respondent No. 1 may kindly be declared 
being illegal, without lawful authority and the respondent No.3 
may kindly be directed to initiate criminal proceedings against 
the respondent No.4 on the application of the petitioner, in the 
interest of justice and proceedings u/s 182 P.P.C. be quashed.” 
 
2.        Brief facts of the case leading up to the filing of this petition are 
that the petitioner moved an application under section 22-A/22-B Code 
of Criminal Procedure, 1898, complaining of the non-registration of the 
F.I.R. by the police authorities with regard to the commission of the 
offence made punishable under section 489-F PPC by Mst. Asia Sattar

W.P. No.9774 of 2022 
(respondent No.4) however, the said application was dismissed by the 
learned Ex Officio Justice of Peace vide order dated 30.03.2022 and a 
further direction was issued to the SHO Police Station Kotwali, District 
Bahawalpur to initiate proceedings against the petitioner in respect of 
offence made punishable under section 182 P.P.C., hence, the petition.  
3. 
The learned counsel for the petitioner, inter alia, contended that 
the learned Ex-officio Justice of Peace, while dismissing the application 
as filed by the petitioner under section 22-A/22-B Cr.P.C, also directed 
the SHO concerned to initiate the proceedings under section 182 P.P.C 
as against the petitioner and in compliance of the said order passed by 
the learned Ex-officio Justice of Peace, a complaint in respect of an 
offence under section 182 P.P.C had been submitted which, under the 
circumstances of the case, was liable to be quashed as no proceeding 
under section 182 P.P.C could have been ordered to be initiated against 
the petitioner for filing of a petition under section 22-A/22-B Cr.P.C. 
The learned counsel for the petitioner placed reliance upon the case of 
“Amanat Masih versus Additional Sessions Judge, Kasur and four 
others” (PLD 2007 Lahore 53).  
4. 
The learned Additional Advocate General has submitted that the 
learned Ex-officio Justice of Peace, exceeded his powers, hence, the 
direction issued by the Ex-officio Justice of Peace to the SHO Police 
Station Kotwali, District Bahawalpur to initiate proceedings against the 
petitioner in respect of offence made punishable under section 182 
P.P.C., be set aside.  
5. 
I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, the learned 
Additional Advocate General and perused the documents appended 

3 
W.P. No.9774 of 2022 
with this petition as well as the impugned order dated 30.03.2022 
passed by the learned Ex-Officio Justice of Peace, Bahawalpur.   
7. 
The record evinces that the petitioner moved an application 
under section 22-A/22-B Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, 
complaining of the non-registration of the F.I.R. by the police 
authorities with regard to the commission of the offence made 
punishable under section 489-F PPC by Mst. Asia Sattar (respondent 
No.4) however, the said application was dismissed by the learned Ex 
Officio Justice of Peace vide order dated 30.03.2022  and a further 
direction was issued to the SHO Police Station Kotwali, District 
Bahawalpur to initiate proceedings against the petitioner in respect of 
offence made punishable under section 182 P.P.C. and subsequent to 
the said direction, a complaint was submitted as against the petitioner 
for holding of a trial in respect of an offence made punishable under 
section 182 P.P.C.  A perusal of the provision of section 22-A(6), 
Cr.P.C. reveals that the learned Ex-officio Justice of Peace  could only 
pass an order directing registration of a criminal case if a cognizable 
offence was made out from the application or decline the same. Any 
direction given to the S.H.O. by the learned ex officio Justice of Peace 
to initiate proceedings against the petitioner under section 182, P.P.C. 
was beyond the purview of section 22-A, Cr.P.C., hence in excess of 
the jurisdiction conferred upon him under the law. The prerogative for 
proceeding under section 182, P.P.C. lies only with the police officer 
who has moved the machinery of law against the accused persons 
nominated in the F.I.R. by the complainant. Section 182, P.P.C. is 
reproduced, for facility of reference:-

W.P. No.9774 of 2022 
"182. False information with intent to cause public servant to use 
his lawful power to the injury of another person.--Whoever gives to 
any public servant any information which he knows or believes to 
be false intending thereby to cause, or knowing it to be likely that 
he will thereby cause such public servant -- 
            (a)        to do or omit anything which such public servant ought not 
to do or omit if the true state of facts respecting which such 
information is given were known by him, or 
            (b)        to use the lawful power of such public servant to the injury 
or annoyance of any person, 
shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term 
which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to 
one thousand rupees, or with both." 
The wording of the section, when split, provides the following essential 
ingredients:- 
(i)         information to a public servant; 
(ii)        informant is in the knowledge that such information is false; 
          (iii)       information is given knowingly to cause such public servant 
to do or to omit anything which such public servant ought not to do 
or omit if the true state of facts respecting such information is given 
were  known by him, or to use the lawful powers for such public 
servant to the injury, or annoyance of any person. 
 
 It is the public servant to whom false information is given by a person 
knowing it to be false, who thereafter, moves the machinery of law 
against the accused person to his detriment or to the injury or annoyance 
of the accused person. The framers of law left the question for 
determination to the public servant, as to how far powers exercised, by 
him caused detriment, annoyance and injury to the person proceeded 
against as accused in consequence of the false information given to him 
by the complainant. It is not for any other authority to direct the 
concerned police officer to proceed against the first informant who is 
giving false information. There may be cases where due to a mistake of 
fact , the wrong person may have been named and this mistake can only 
be rectified if a chance is given to the complainant before proceedings

W.P. No.9774 of 2022 
against him to show cause as to why action may not be taken. In order 
to initiate action under section 182, P.P.C., it is essential that the false 
complaint involving cognizable offence should properly be registered, 
investigated and found to be false and baseless. In this manner,the 
prerogative to proceed under section 182, P.P.C. lies only with the 
Police Officer, who has moved the machinery of law against the 
accused nominated in the F.I.R. by the complainant and no other 
Authority can direct the concerned Police Officer to proceed against the 
first informant, who has given the false information. 
8. 
For the above identified reasons, it is a fit case for interference 
and invalidation of the impugned order. Therefore, by allowing this 
petition, the impugned order dated 30.03.2022, passed by the learned 
Ex-Officio Justice of Peace, Bahawalpur, to the extent of the 
direction given to the SHO Police Station Kotwali, District 
Bahawalpur to initiate proceedings against the petitioner in respect 
of offence made punishable under section 182 P.P.C. is set-aside. 
Consequently, the complaint submitted against the petitioner for 
holding a trial in respect of an offence made punishable under section 
182 P.P.C., and all the proceedings thereon, are also quashed.
