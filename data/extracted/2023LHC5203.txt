This Appeal preferred in terms of Order 
XLIII of the Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908) 
arises out of the order dated 20.05.2023, whereby 
learned Civil Judge, Ist Class, Rawalpindi 
proceeded to decline the ad interim injunction to 
the Appellant in the suit for specific performance, 
permanent and mandatory injunction.     
2. 
Brief facts as per contents of this Appeal are 
that the Appellant entered into an agreement to sell 
dated 15.04.2021 with Respondent No.1 (an owner 
and Attorney of respondents No. 2 and 3) qua 230-kanal 
suit-land 
situated 
in 
Mouza 
Daghal 
and 
Gorakhpur, District Rawalpindi against the total 
sale consideration of rupees twenty-two crore 
forty-two 
lacs 
and 
fifty 
thousand 
(Rs.22,42,50,000/-). The Appellant paid amounts 
of Rs.2000,0000/- (rupees two crore) as an earnest 

2 
FAO No.54 of 2023 
money through Pay Order dated 603018 dated 
13.04.2021 and, thereafter; an amount of 
Rs.20,00,0000/- (rupees two crore) at the time of 
execution of agreement dated 15.04.2021. That an 
amount of Rs.2,000,0000/- (rupees tow crore) was 
to be paid by the Appellant within two months and 
the remaining amount was to be paid till 
15.08.2021, when the suit-land was stipulated to 
be transferred in the name of the Appellant by 
Respondents No.1 to 3, but it could not be done by 
them despite repeatedly made requests; nor Fard 
of the suit land was provided to the Appellant for 
verification of the suit land, hence; the suit for 
specific performance, permanent and Mandatory 
inunction praying for issuance of a decree against 
Respondents No.1 to 3 along with an application 
under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 CPC for 
restraining 
them 
not 
to 
further 
sell/alienate/transfer the suit land was filed. The 
learned Civil Judge, Ist Class, Rawalpindi, vide 
order dated 20.05.2023 rejected the request of the 
Appellant for grant of ad interim injunction made 
in the suit whilst directing them to pay/deposit 
remaining consideration of Rs.20,42,50,000/- till 
adjourned date otherwise extending warning that 
the suit will be dismissed due to non-
deposit/payment of remaining consideration. 
However, the main application seeking interim 
injunction is yet pending. 
3. 
    It is contended by learned counsel for the 
Appellant that while passing the impugned order, 
the trial court did not take into account that 
Respondents No.1 to 3 under the agreement to sell 

3 
FAO No.54 of 2023 
dated 05.04.2021 were bound to transfer the suit 
land in favour of the Appellant especially when 
appellant 
has 
deposited 
the 
remaining 
consideration amount of Rs.20,42,50,000/- in 
compliance or order dated 06.06.2023, passed by 
this Court. Lastly, prays for setting aside of 
impugned order dated 20.05.2023, passed by 
learned trial court.  
4. 
On the other hand, learned counsel for 
Respondents No. 1 to 3 raises question qua 
maintainability of this Appeal by stating that the 
Appellant has not come to this Court with clean 
hands, as the suit filed by him for specific 
performance, 
permanent 
and 
Mandatory 
injunction is still sub judice, as mere the relief 
regarding grant of ad interim relief has been 
declined therein. Besides, the main application 
filed under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 CPC is 
yet pending adjudication with the trial court and in 
this very situation, filing of this Appeal under 
Order XLIII of the Code of Civil Procedure (V of 
1908) is not maintainable and is liable to be 
dismissed on this score only. Adds that even 
otherwise, aforesaid agreement to sell dated 
05.04.2021 was actually executed by Respondent 
No.1 (Dr. Faisal Murad/defendant No.1 one of the Respondents’ 
brothers) with one Kamran Rafique Raja while 
Muzaffar Zaman/Defendant No.3 is not signatory 
thereof. However, Respondents No.2 and 3 were 
apprised by Respondent No.1 about the agreement 
and a consensus was developed amongst the 
brothers/Respondents that if further payment of 
Rs.2000,0000/- (two crore) was made within the 

4 
FAO No.54 of 2023 
specified time in the agreement to sell i.e. till 30th 
of June 2021, then they would abide by the deal 
but not otherwise. Further adds that admittedly the 
Appellant had failed to fulfill its commitment 
within the stipulated time in accordance with the 
chalked-out agreement to sell and he did not ever 
contacted with them (Respondents) for transfer of 
the property, as he had not made payment as per 
agreement. In this regard, the learned counsel 
referrers Clause 11 of the agreement which reads 
under:- 
"ہی ہک  ا یک لیمکت ےک ےیل اچر
 
ارقار انہم ھذ 
 امہ اک وتق رقمر ایک ایگ
ہے 
 اور اس ےک دعب ہی
ارقارانہم وسنمخ وصتر وہاگ اور رفقی اول وک اایتخر وہاگ ہک وہ یسک یھب صخش/ 
 ادارہ ےک
اسھت این ارقار انہم اعمدہہ رک ےل رفقی دو
ئم
 وک اس رپ وکیئ ارتعاض ہن وہاگ اور ہن رفقی دو
ئم 
اس ےک الخف یسک مسق یک اقونین اچرہ وجیئ اک
 قح راتھک ےہ"۔ 
In view of the above, as the Appellant has not 
fulfilled terms of the agreement to sell, therefore, 
the subject suit filed by him and the instant Appeal 
filed against an interim order is not maintainable, 
thus, is liable to be dismissed. 
5. 
Heard. 
6. 
Perusal of the record reveals that admittedly 
the agreement to sell dated 05.04.2021 has been 
executed between the parties, though there are 
certain apparent shortfalls in fulfilment of terms 
thereof, yet the considerable fact rests in field that 
only ad-interim injunction sought for in the suit 
filed by the Appellant has been declined while a 
date has been stated to be fixed for arguments of 
the parties upon point of maintainability of said 
suit. Besides, the main Application filed under 
Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 CPC is still pending 
adjudication as well with trial court. It has already 

5 
FAO No.54 of 2023 
been elaborated in case Exceed (SMC Pvt. Ltd.) 
through President and Chief Executive Vs. ZTAF 
ZHONGXING Telecom Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd. 
through Executive Director and another (2007 
CLC 348) that “The word "ad interim" is 
distinguishable than the word "temporary" "ad 
interim" would mean for the meantime (to make 
the interim gap) while the word "temporary" 
means for a certain fixed period, therefore, refusal 
of the "ad interim" injunction would not amount to 
a case `decided'.” Moreover, it cannot be denied 
or brushed aside that the Appellant has deposited 
the remaining above-mentioned consideration 
amount in compliance of order dated 06.06.2023 
passed by this Court.  
7. 
Since the matter before this Court is 
regarding ad interim injunction and trial court is 
seized with matter, hence without touching merits 
of the case instant Appeal is disposed of with 
direction to the trial court to finally decide the 
application under Order XXXIX Rules 1&2 CPC 
within ten days from the date of receipt of certified 
copy of this order after affording an opportunity of 
hearing to the parties and without being influenced 
with instant order. Parties are directed to appear 
before the trial court on 30.10.2023.
