JUDGMENT 
 
Date of hearing: 
 
 
5.4.2024 
For the Petitioner: 
Mr. Salman Shahid Khan, Advocate. 
For the Respondents: 
Mr. Khalid Ishaq, Advocate General Punjab, 
and Mr. Sittar Sahil, Assistant Advocate 
General, with Maryam Rani/SI. 
 
 
 
 
Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – The Petitioner lodged FIR 
No.1409/2022 dated 27.10.2022 at Police Station City Hafizabad, alleging 
offences under sections 376(1), 384, and 341 PPC against three individuals 
for abducting and raping her. She further claimed that they recorded her 
nude videos and threatened to publicize them on social media if she 
disclosed the incident. The investigation was assigned to Gul Rukh 
Tabassum/ASI, but the Petitioner accused him of dishonesty and bias toward 
the accused. Consequently, she submitted an application to the District 
Police Officer, Hafizabad (Respondent No.1), requesting the transfer of the 
investigation to another police officer. Allegedly, Respondent No.1 did not 
attend to it, upon which she filed Writ Petition No.4770/2023 seeking a writ 
of mandamus. By an order dated 25.1.2023, this Court directed Respondent 
No.1 to decide the Petitioner’s aforementioned application, if pending, in 
accordance with the law within fifteen days. 
2. 
 
Respondent No.1 placed the Petitioner’s application before the 
District Standing Board under Article 18-A(5)(a) of the Police Order 2002. 
The Board recommended it upon which Respondent No.1 transferred the 
investigation of case FIR No.1409/2022 to Maryam Rani/SI vide order dated 
9.2.2023.

The Petitioner contends that FIR No.1409/2022 falls within the 
purview of the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Act, 2021 (the “Anti-
Rape Act”). Therefore, it must be investigated by a special sexual offences 
investigation unit (SSOIU) established under section 9 of the Act. Individual 
police officers cannot investigate such cases, even if they are members of the 
SSOIU in the relevant district. According to her, Respondent No.1’s order 
dated 9.2.2023 is bad in law. Maryam Rani/SI is not competent to conduct 
the investigation independently as a single officer without other unit 
members. 
4. 
 
The Petitioner approached Respondent No.1 with the above 
contention and requested him to transfer her case to a team of officers. 
Respondent No.1 disagreed with her interpretation of section 9 of the Anti-
Rape Act and orally declined her request. Through this petition under Article 
199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the 
Petitioner challenges the legality of the order dated 9.2.2023. 
5. 
 
The Advocate General Punjab submits that section 9 of the 
Anti-Rape Act has introduced the concept of SSOIUs with special 
jurisdiction to investigate sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) 
offences within their designated areas. This legislative initiative aims to 
ensure that qualified and dedicated officers handle such cases efficiently and 
with expertise and expedite justice for victims. It would prevent delays in the 
trial process and ensure its completion within four months, the time 
specified in section 16 of the Act. 
6. 
 
The Advocate General further submits that the Anti-Rape Act 
does not specify the exact composition of the SSOIUs to be established. 
Section 9(2) only provides that SSOIU shall comprise officers who have 
received specialized training concerning sexual offences, and, secondly, one 
member of the unit shall preferably be a female police officer. According to 
the Advocate General, to the extent of Punjab, the Home Department has 
issued a notification dated 20.9.2023, whereby SSOIUs have been 
established in every district as outlined in the list annexed therewith. The 
number of units formed in each district and the personnel assigned to them 
vary based on the distinct geographical and legal requirements of each area. 
For instance, District Lahore boasts seven SSOIUs with 93 officers, whereas 
Rahim Yar Khan has a single unit staffed by 33 personnel.

The 
Advocate 
General 
argues 
that 
the 
Petitioner’s 
understanding of section 9 of the Anti-Rape Act is flawed. A single officer 
may effectively exercise all the powers necessary to investigate the offences 
mentioned in the schedules of the Act (referred to as the “Scheduled 
Offences”). Mandating the entire unit to investigate every case collectively 
would be impracticable and frustrate the Act’s objective of speedy 
investigation and trial. 
Opinion 
8. 
 
The preamble of the Anti-Rape Act reads as follows: 
“An Act to ensure expeditious redressal of rape and sexual abuse crimes in 
respect of women and children through special investigation teams and 
Special Courts providing for efficacious procedures, speedy trial, evidence 
and matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.” 
9. 
 
The preamble is a part of a statute, though not its operative part. 
Nevertheless, it provides a valuable guide to find out the legislative intent. 
Coke said: “The preamble of the statute is a good means to find out the 
meaning of the statute, and as it were, a key to open the understanding 
thereof.”1 According to another jurist, “it is a key to open the minds of the 
makers of the Act, and the mischiefs which they intend to redress.”2  
In Brett v. Brett [1826] 162 ER 456, Sir John Nicholl observed: 
“The key to the opening of every law is the reason and spirit of the law – it 
is the animus imponents, the intention of the law-maker expressed in the 
law itself taken as a whole. Hence, to arrive at the true meaning of any 
particular phrase in a statute, that particular phrase is not to be viewed 
detached from its context in the statute, it is to be viewed in connection 
with its whole context meaning by this as well as the title, and the 
preamble as the purview or enacting part of the statute. It is to the 
preamble more specially that we are to look for the reason or spirit of 
every statute, rehearsing it, as it ordinarily does, the evils sought to be 
remedied, or the doubts purported to be removed by the state, and so 
evidencing in the best and most satisfactory manner, the object or 
intention of the legislature in making and passing the statute itself.” 
10. 
 
In Murree Brewery Co. Ltd. v. Pakistan through the Secretary 
to 
Government 
of 
Pakistan, 
Works 
Division, 
and 
others  
(PLD 1972 SC 279), the  Supreme Court of Pakistan held that “the preamble 
is a legitimate aid in discovering the purpose of a statute.” In  
Mst. Ummatullah through Attorney v. Province of Sindh and others  
(PLD 2010 Karachi 236), a Division Bench of the Sindh High Court held

that “preamble is the gateway to any statute; it is bedrock to understand the 
scope, purpose and object to any statute.”  Similarly, in Kamil Khan 
Mumtaz and others v. Province of Punjab through Chief Secretary, 
Government of Punjab, and others (PLD 2016 Lahore 699), a Division 
Bench of this Court ruled: 
“A preamble is, therefore, a window to the main statute. Although the 
preamble does not control the main enactment, it certainly gives an inkling 
of the intention of the legislature and the policy of the Act.  The concept 
relating to the policy of the Act is of paramount importance, and all 
interpretation must be done in accordance with the policy and the intention 
of the legislature found therein.” 
11. 
 
The preamble of the Anti-Rape Act expresses the nation’s 
resolve to confront the pervasive issue of sexual violence and gender-based 
crimes. It highlights that the Act aims to develop efficacious procedures to 
streamline the entire judicial process from the time a crime is reported to its 
resolution in court. This includes adopting faster and more effective methods 
of processing cases, better management of evidence to preserve its integrity 
for trials, and swiftly bringing perpetrators to justice. In Sumaira v. The 
State etc. (2023 LHC 4535), this Court ruled that the Act serves as a 
remedial social statute. 
12. 
 
The Anti-Rape Act is a remarkable legislative initiative aimed 
at upholding the constitutional rights of women and children, including their 
rights to life, dignity, and justice. Additionally, it seeks to fulfil Pakistan’s 
obligations under international law, which require it to address the scourge 
of sexual violence. 
13. 
 
Section 9 of the Anti-Rape Act outlines the following procedure 
for investigating the Scheduled Offences: 
9. 
Investigation in respect of scheduled offences.— (1) For the 
purposes of investigation under this Act, special sexual offences 
investigation units (SSOIUs) shall be established in every district by the 
provincial governments and for the purposes of the Islamabad Capital 
Territory by the federal Government. 
(2) 
The SSOIU shall comprise police officers who have received 
training on investigation in relation to sexual offences and preferably one 
member of the unit shall be a female police officer. 
(3) 
The investigation in respect of offences mentioned under this Act 
shall be carried out as follows: 
(i) 
for offences mentioned in Schedule-I, by the SSOIU; and 
(ii) 
for offences mentioned in Schedule-II, by SSOIU under the 
supervision of a police officer not below the rank of  
BPS-17. 

Writ Petition No. 12912/2023 
 
 
 
- 5 - 
(4) 
In case the complainant in relation to an offence under Schedule-II 
expresses dissatisfaction which is based on reasonable grounds, the 
investigation shall be transferred to the district head of investigation of the 
police. 
(5)  
The officers of the SSOIUs shall ordinarily be from the area in 
which the occurrence of the offence has taken place: 
 
Provided that in exceptional circumstances, and where the dictates 
of fair, accurate and technical investigation warrant otherwise, officers 
from areas other than the area of occurrence, may be deputed in the 
SSOIUs. 
(6) 
Upon completion of investigation, the SSOIU shall, through the 
prosecutor general or special prosecutors, submit the final report under 
section 173 of the Code before the Special Court. 
14. 
 
Section 9 supra introduces a crucial mechanism for handling 
the intricacies of investigating sexual offences by establishing Special 
Sexual Offences Investigation Units (SSOIUs) in every district by provincial 
governments and in the Islamabad Capital Territory by the federal 
government. This provision embodies a contemporary law enforcement 
approach, recognizing the need for specialized expertise and dedicated 
resources to address such crimes effectively. The formation of SSOIUs 
reflects the Act’s victim-centred approach, emphasizing survivors’ rights, 
dignity, and well-being throughout the investigative process. By prioritizing 
the needs of survivors, SSOIUs create a supportive environment conducive 
to reporting incidents of sexual violence and seeking justice. 
15. 
 
The concept of “investigation units” is distinguishable from 
“joint investigation teams” (JITs). They serve unique purposes in the pursuit 
of justice. Investigation units typically operate within a single law 
enforcement agency and are specialized teams or divisions responsible for 
investigating various types of crimes. These units, such as homicide or 
cybercrime units, focus on specific areas of criminal activity and possess 
expertise and resources tailored to their respective fields. In contrast, JITs 
are collaborative entities formed by multiple law enforcement agencies or 
governmental entities to investigate specific cases or types of crimes that 
transcend jurisdictional boundaries. Comprising representatives from various 
agencies and stakeholders, JITs pool together resources, expertise, and 
investigative powers to address cases requiring cooperation and coordination 
across different jurisdictions. While investigation units concentrate on 
internal investigations within a single agency, JITs facilitate cross-agency 
collaboration to tackle cases that demand a unified approach. 

Writ Petition No. 12912/2023 
 
 
 
- 6 - 
16. 
 
The Anti-Rape Act does not define the precise composition of 
the SSOIUs but only gives broad parameters. Section 9(2) of the Act 
stipulates that the SSOIUs shall comprise police officers who have received 
training on investigation in relation to sexual offences, and preferably, one 
member of the unit shall be a female police officer. Section 9(3) mandates 
that investigations for offences listed in Schedule-I shall be conducted 
exclusively by the SSOIU, while those in Schedule-II are to be carried out 
by the SSOIU under the supervision of a police officer not below the rank of 
BPS-17. Two interpretations of section 9 of the Anti-Rape Act are possible: 
first, that the SSOIU as a unit should handle the investigation of Scheduled 
Offences collectively, and second, that individual police officers who are 
members of the SSOIU in the relevant district may conduct the 
investigations independently. 
17. 
 
The first interpretation, which advocates for a collaborative 
approach involving multiple unit members in each investigation, could 
present practical challenges. Expecting the entire unit to handle every case 
could lead to inefficiencies and delays, undermining the Act’s objective of 
expediting investigations and trials. On the other hand, the second 
interpretation, which permits individual officers within the unit to undertake 
the investigations autonomously, offers a more flexible and potentially more 
efficient use of personnel and resources. Considering these factors, the 
second approach is more effective, pragmatic, and likely better suited to 
accomplishing the Act’s objectives. The success of the Act hinges on 
striking the right balance between the need for specialized units and the 
practical realities of resource allocation and case management. 
18. 
 
It is, however, important to note that the Anti-Rape Act 
encourages the involvement of lady police officers in handling the 
Scheduled Offences – though it does not impose a strict requirement. 
Section 9 of the Act states that the SSOIU should preferably have a female 
police officer as one of its members who has received training on 
investigation in relation to sexual offences. The use of the word “preferably” 
instead of “must” indicates flexibility in unit formation, recognizing factors 
such as staffing constraints and resource availability.  
19. 
 
Sections 154, 161 and 164A Cr.P.C. contain special provisions 
for recording FIRs, examining witnesses, and medical examination of

victims of sexual abuse. The Anti-Rape (Investigation) Rules 2022 also cast 
certain duties on a female police officer when appointed.3 The purpose of 
these provisions is that where the victim is a woman or child, the association 
of a woman officer with the investigation makes them feel comparatively 
comfortable and, in some instances, even prevent re-traumatization. 
20. 
 
Although it is technically permissible for a single officer to 
investigate Scheduled Offences, the Anti-Rape Act does not prohibit the 
constitution of special teams. Hence, considering the legislative intent, if the 
victim is a woman or a child, or if circumstances otherwise demand, the 
investigation of the case should be entrusted to a lady officer. Alternatively, 
she could be included as a member of a special team. 
21. 
 
On 15.12.2020, the President promulgated the Anti-Rape 
(Investigation and Trial) Ordinance 2020. The National Assembly extended 
the law for another 120 days, with effect from 13.4.2021. The Ordinance 
also contained two Schedules mentioning the offences it dealt with. Section 
9 of the said legislation provided the procedure for their investigation4 and 
envisaged the setting up of a special JIT for the investigation of offences 
mentioned in Schedule-II (with offences under Schedule-I left to be carried 
out by any police officer not below BPS-17). Section 9 of the Ordinance 
prescribed that the JIT shall comprise of the District Police Officer as the 
                                          
3 In exercise of the powers conferred by section 19(1) of the Anti-Rape Act, the Ministry of Law and 
Justice, upon the recommendations of the Special Committee (see section 15 of the Anti-Rape Act), has 
framed the Anti-Rape (Investigation) Rules 2022. These Rules incorporate the “Standard Operating 
Procedure (SOP) for Investigation of Rape Cases” dated 20th August 2013 issued by the Investigation 
Branch, Lahore, which was affirmed by the Supreme Court in Babar v. The State (2020 SCMR 761). 
4 For facility of reference, section 9 of the Ordinance of 2020 is reproduced below: 
9. 
Investigation in respect of Scheduled offences.– (1) The investigation in respect of 
offences mentioned in Schedule-I shall be carried out by a police officer not below the grade of 
BPS-17, who preferably shall be a female police officer. 
(2) 
The investigation in respect of offences mentioned in Schedule-II shall be carried out by 
a special Joint Investigation Team (JIT) comprising the following, out of which at least one shall 
preferably be a woman: 
(a) 
the District Police Officer (DPO) as the Head; 
(b) 
one Superintendent of Police (Investigation); 
(c) 
one Deputy Superintendent of Police; 
(d) 
one Station House Officer. 
(3) 
The officers of the JIT shall ordinarily be from the relevant area in which the occurrence 
of the offence has taken place; however, in exceptional circumstances, where the dictates of fair 
investigation warrant otherwise, the concerned Inspector General of Police (IGP) may depute in 
the JIT, officers from areas other than the area of occurrence. 
(4) 
Upon completion of investigation, the JIT shall, through the Prosecutor General or 
Special Prosecutors, submit a report before the Special Court: 
Provided that notwithstanding anything contained in the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 
(P.O. 10 of 1984), such report shall be admissible in evidence within the meaning of section 173 
of the Code. 

Writ Petition No. 12912/2023

head, one Superintendent of Police 
(Investigation), one 
Deputy 
Superintendent of Police, and one Station House Officer. In the case of a 
JIT, it may be correct to presume that the investigation was to be entrusted to 
the JIT as a whole instead of its individual members. However, the fact that 
while enacting the Anti-Rape Act 2021, the legislature made a conscious 
departure from the concept of a JIT and resorted to the establishment of 
SSOIUs in each district also suggests that its intent was not to assign the 
investigation of the Scheduled Offences to the entire unit.  
22. 
 
Our law, jurisprudence and practice allow the constitution of a 
joint investigation team to investigate sensitive and complex cases. The 
observations in the preceding paragraph should not be construed to mean 
that the Anti-Rape Act prohibits the constitution of a joint investigation team 
to investigate a particular case. As highlighted above, the concept of 
“investigation units” is distinguishable from JIT. 
23. 
 
One of the important features which gave rise to the 
controversy that I seek to address through this judgment is section 10 of the 
Anti-Rape Act, which reads as follows: 
10. 
Connected offences not in the Schedules.– The investigation 
officer or the joint investigation team (JIT), as the case may be, under 
section 9, may also take cognizance of offences not listed in the schedules, 
committed in connection with the scheduled offences, as if those offences 
were scheduled offences. 
24. 
 
Section 10 of the Ordinance of 2020 was couched in precisely 
the same words as section 10 of the Anti-Rape Act reproduced above. Since 
section 9 of the Ordinance envisaged JIT as an essential component of the 
investigative process, its mention in section 10 of the Ordinance was 
imperative. This is not so under the Anti-Rape Act. The draftsman 
apparently transcribed section 10 from the Ordinance when drafting the 
Anti-Rape Act, overlooking the disparity in the investigative procedures 
between the two legislations. Consequently, section 10 of the Anti-Rape Act 
should be interpreted to address instances where the Competent Authority 
establishes a JIT specifically. 
25. 
 
Given the above, I can’t entirely agree with the Petitioner’s 
contention that every Scheduled Offence under the Anti-Rape Act has to be 
investigated by the entire SSOIU.

In the present case, Respondent No.1 has transferred the 
investigation of case FIR No.1409/2022 to Maryam Rani/SI vide order dated 
9.2.2023. The Advocate General has submitted documents reflecting that she 
is fully trained to investigate sexual offences. In light of the above 
discussion, I find her competent to investigate the case and overrule the 
Petitioner’s objection.

This petition is dismissed.
