MUHAMMAD WAHEED KHAN, J.- Through 
the instant appeal, the appellant has challenged conviction and 
sentence awarded to him by the learned Addl. Sessions Judge, 
Dera Gazi Khan vide judgment dated 25.02.2023 in case FIR 
No.709 dated 04.09.2022 registered u/s 9 (c) of the Control of 
Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 at Police Station Gaddai, Dera 
Gazi Khan, whereby on conclusion of trial, he was convicted 
u/s 9 (c) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 and

weighing 1080 grams, second wrapped in a blue coloured 
tape weighing 1070 grams and the third packet wrapped in 
blue coloured shopper bag weighing 1020 grams), total 
weighing 3170 grams, were recovered and an amount of 
Rs.4350/- was also recovered from him. The complainant 
prepared three separate sealed parcels of samples and three 
others of the remaining case property and took the said six 
parcels alongwith motorcycle and cash into possession, 
hence, this case. 
3. 
After registration of case, police investigated the matter 
and submitted report u/s 173 Cr.P.C. before the learned trial 
Court by declaring the appellant as guilty. Learned trial Court 
after completing codal formalities, framed charge against the 
appellant, which was denied by him, so, the prosecution 
evidence was summoned. In order to prove the charge against 
the appellant, the prosecution produced as many as six 
witnesses. Allah Bachaya ASI, who chalked out FIR appeared 
as PW-1, Shehbaz Qalandar 924/HC, Moharrar of Police 
Station 
appeared 
as 
PW-2, 
Muhammad 
Sadiq 
SI, 
Investigating Officer of the case appeared as PW-3, Allah 
Dewaya 930/C witness of recovery appeared as PW-4, Tahir 
Saleem T/SI complainant of the case appeared as PW-5 and 
Muhammad Qasim 1148/C, who transmitted the complaint to 
the Police Station appeared as PW-6. The prosecution after 
producing certain documents including report of Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency (Ex-PG) closed its evidence. The 
appellant was examined u/s 342 Cr.P.C., wherein he denied all 
the allegations leveled against him. He did not opt to appear u/s 
340(2) Cr.P.C. as his own witness, however, produced certain 
documents in his defence. 
4. 
In support of the instant appeal, learned counsel for the 
appellant has submitted that the prosecution story is inherently 

 
 
3 
Cr. Appeal No.206 of 2023 
(Muhammad Adnan  v. The State, etc) 
 
 
flawed, failed to inspire confidence and the impugned judgment 
is not only based on surmises and conjectures but material 
evidence available on record has been mis-read; In alternate, 
learned counsel for the appellant submits that since the 
prosecution remained failed to prove the case qua the safe 
custody of the parcels containing the case property so the same 
cannot be used against the appellant and the maximum he could 
be saddled with the responsibility to the extent of sample 
parcels containing 54/54 grams and 51 grams (total 159 grams) 
of contraband in the light of guidelines given by the august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in case titled as “AMEER ZEB v. 
THE STATE” (PLD 2012 Supreme Court 380).   
5. 
Conversely, learned Deputy Prosecutor General while 
faithfully supporting the impugned judgment, candidly admitted 
that the prosecution could not prove the safe custody of the 
parcels containing the case property, so, the appellant can only 
be held responsible of quantity of narcotics containing in 
sample parcels i.e. 159 grams. 
6. 
We have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the 
appellant, learned Law Officer and perused the record with their 
assistance. On in depth analysis of record, we have straightway 
noticed that as per testimony of Shahbaz Qalandar 924/HC 
Moharrar Police Station (PW-2), he handed over the parcels 
containing the case property to Tahir Saleem SI (PW-5) 
complainant of the case, for depositing the same in Sadar Mall 
Khana on 06.09.2022. Regarding this fact, he (PW-2) deposed 
in the dock in the following manner;- 
“I sent the case property to Malkhana Saddar through 
Tahir Saleem SI on 06.09.2022. I.O recorded my statement 
in this regard. The parcels remained intact as long as in my 
custody.”  
 
But the said Tahir Saleem SI, while appearing before the 
learned trial Court as PW-5 did not depose a single word 

 
 
4 
Cr. Appeal No.206 of 2023 
(Muhammad Adnan  v. The State, etc) 
 
 
regarding receiving the parcel(s) containing case property from 
Moharrar Police Station (PW-2) for depositing the same in 
Saddar Malkhana. The said portion of testimony of (PW-5) is 
reproduced as under;- 
“On 05.09.2022, Shahbaz Qalandar Moharrir handed over 
to me three sample parcels for onward transmission to the 
office of PFSA alongwith road certificate 990/2021, which 
I deposited the aforesaid office on 06.09.2022 intact.” 
 
It shows that PW-5 did not depose about receiving of parcels 
containing case property for depositing the same in the Saddar 
Malkhana in safe custody.  
7. 
A case under the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 
1997 contains two components/limbs i.e. firstly, the prosecution 
is bound to establish the safe custody and safe transmission 
from the place of recovery of seized drug by the police, 
including separation of representative parcel(s) of the seized 
drug and its despatch to the testing laboratory and secondly, the 
chain of custody of the parcel(s) containing the ‘case property’ 
is also pivotal, and the prosecution is also supposed to prove its 
safe custody as far as the same remained with the police and 
then despatched to the trial Court as a ‘case property’ intact, 
and any break in the chain of custody or lapse in the control of 
possession of the sample(s) containing case property causes 
doubt on its safe custody and safe transmission to the Court of 
law. In case of “AMEER ZEB v. THE STATE” (PLD 2012 
Supreme Court 380), the top Court has observed that the 
Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, stipulates 
disproportionately long and harsh sentences and, therefore, for 
the purpose of safe administration of criminal justice, some 
minimum standards of safety are to be laid down so as to strike 
a balance between the prosecution and the defence and to 
obviate chances of miscarriage of justice on account of 
exaggeration by the Investigating Agency. Such minimum 

 
 
5 
Cr. Appeal No.206 of 2023 
(Muhammad Adnan  v. The State, etc) 
 
 
standards of safety are even otherwise necessary for 
safeguarding the Fundamental Rights of the citizens regarding 
life and liberty which cannot be left at the mercy of verbal 
assertions of police officers, which assertions are not supported 
by independent evidence provided by a Chemical Examiner. In 
cases of “The State through Regional Director ANF v. Imam 
Bakhsh and others” (2018 SCMR 2039), “Ikramullah and 
others v. The State” (2015 SCMR 1002) and “Amjad Ali v. The 
State” (2012 SCMR 577), the Apex Court had bound down the 
prosecution to substantiate the safe transmission of sample(s) of 
the recovered substance right from its recovery from the 
accused, keeping it safe with the police and then its onward 
transmission to the Forensic Laboratory but in case of “ABDUL 
GHANI and others v. The STATE and others” (2019 SCMR 
608), the top Court went ahead of this by observing that in a 
case where the safe custody of the recovered substance or safe 
transmission of sample(s) of the recovered substance was not 
proved by the prosecution through independent evidence, it 
cannot not be concluded that the prosecution had succeeded in 
establishing its case against the accused beyond reasonable 
doubt. In the above referred case, the top Court had given its 
observation in the following manner;- 
“There is hardly any occasion for discussing the merits of 
the case against the appellants because the record of the 
case shows that safe custody of the recovered substance as 
well as safe transmission of samples of the recovered 
substance to the office of the Chemical Examiner had not 
been established by the prosecution in this case. Nisar 
Ahmad, S.I./SHO  complainant (PW1) had stated before the 
trial Court that he had deposited the recovered substance 
at the Malkhana of the local Police Station but admittedly 
the Moharrir of the said Police Station had not been 
produced before the trial Court to depose about safe 
custody of the recovered substance." 
  
 
 
 
 
Underline provided for emphasis.  
Meaning thereby that it was incumbent upon the prosecution to 
prove the safe custody and transmission of both components/ 

 
 
6 
Cr. Appeal No.206 of 2023 
(Muhammad Adnan  v. The State, etc) 
 
 
limbs of case i.e. sample parcel(s) and the case property. In the 
judgment passed by this Court in case of “ABID ALI v. The 
STATE” (2022 P.Cr.L.J 1088), the case of the prosecution was 
disbelieved as the prosecution remained unable to prove the 
safe custody of the second component i.e. safe custody of 
parcel(s) containing the case property. In another judgment 
rendered by this Court in case of “ABDUL GHAFOOR v. The 
STATE and others” (2021 P.Cr. L J 1624), it had been 
observed that a portion of 78 grams of recovered narcotic was 
segregated for chemical analysis and the rest of 1472 grams 
recovered narcotic was secured separately however, prosecution 
witnesses could not prove as to who transmitted parcel 
containing said 1472 grams and no evidence was presented to 
show how such parcel was retrieved and brought to Court to be 
exhibited as evidence. The accused was held responsible/guilty 
to the extent of narcotic containing sample parcel.  
8. 
So, in the light of above discussion, we believe that the 
prosecution remained failed to adduce the evidence qua the safe 
custody and safe transmission of the sample(s) containing the 
‘case property’ as observed earlier that Tahir Saleem SI (PW-5) 
had not deposed in the line of the assertion of Shahbaz 
Qalandar 924/HC, Moharrar of Police Station (PW-2), wherein 
he claimed that he handed over the parcels containing the case 
property to the said Tahir Saleem SI (PW-5), rather he did not 
utter a single word about handing over the parcels containing 
‘case property’ to him. Meaning thereby that an important link 
is missing regarding the safe custody of the ‘case property’ and 
we have reached to an irresistible conclusion that the 
prosecution remained failed to prove its case to the extent of 
parcels containing the ‘case property’. Hence, in all 
eventualities the narcotic containing the ‘case property’ cannot 
be used against the appellant. So, he cannot be held guilty of 

 
 
7 
Cr. Appeal No.206 of 2023 
(Muhammad Adnan  v. The State, etc) 
 
 
the quantity i.e. 3011 grams of charas and as such conviction 
and sentence awarded to him by the learned trial Court u/s 9 (c) 
of the Act ibid cannot be allowed to stand, rather he would be 
convicted and sentenced to the extent of samples consisting of 
54/54 grams and 51 grams (total 159 grams), which were 
received in the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) and 
the same were tested as positive through report Ex-PG. 
Therefore, the appellant is held responsible for having only to 
the extent of three ‘sample parcels’ weighing 156 grams in his 
possession. In this view of the matter conviction recorded by 
the learned trial Court is converted into conviction of the 
appellant from section 9 (c) to section 9 (b) of the Act ibid and 
he is sentenced to one year and three months rigorous 
imprisonment and fine of Rs.9,000/-, in default whereof, to 
further undergo simple imprisonment for three months and 
fifteen days while applying the sentencing policy of this Court, 
laid down in case of “GHULAM MURTAZA and another v. 
THE STATE” (PLD 2009 Lahore 362). Benefit of section 382-
B Cr.P.C. is also extended to the appellant.  
9. 
With the above modification in conviction and sentence 
of the appellant, the instant appeal is dismissed.
