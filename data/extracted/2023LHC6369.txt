Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – Respondent No.5 filed FIR 
No.2439/2021 dated 08.12.2021 at Police Station Sundar, Lahore, 
under sections 457 and 380 PPC against unknown persons for stealing 
170 bags of fertilizer worth Rs.374,000/- from the godown of  
M/s Z.N. Enterprises where he worked as a Manager. Subsequently, 
Respondent No.5 named the Petitioner as an accused in the said case. 
During the investigation, the police found that the Petitioner was 
innocent and that the FIR was false. Consequently, they filed a 
cancellation report with which the Magistrate concurred. The 
Petitioner claims that Respondent No.5 was his ex-employee whom he 
dismissed for embezzlement. According to him, he also has a long 
history of animosity with Respondent No.6, the owner of Z.N. 
Enterprises. Respondents No.5 & 6 conspired against him, staging a 
farce through FIR No. 2439/2021 and entangled him in it to torment 
him. Following the cancellation of the FIR, the Petitioner asked the 
Respondent SHO to initiate proceedings under section 182 PPC 
against Respondents No.5 and 6 but he refused. Upon his inaction, he 
filed an application under section 22-A Cr.P.C. before the Ex-officio 
Justice of Peace, praying that a direction be issued to the Respondent 
SHO to start such proceedings. The Ex-officio Justice of Peace 
dismissed his application by order dated 23.12.2022 for lack of 
jurisdiction. This petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, is directed against that order.

I have heard the Petitioner’s counsel, Mr Zubair Afzal 
Rana, Advocate. Let’s first see what section 182 PPC is about. I have 
reproduced it below for facility of reference: 
 
182. False information with intent to cause public servant to 
use his lawful power to the injury of another person. – Whoever 
gives to any public servant any information which he knows or 
believes to be false, intending thereby to cause, or knowing it to be 
likely that he will thereby cause, such public servant: 
 
(a) 
to do or omit anything which such public servant ought not 
to do or omit if the true state of facts respecting which such 
information is given were known by him, or 
 
(b) 
to use the lawful power of such public servant to the injury 
or annoyance of any person, shall be punished with imprisonment 
of either description for a term which may [extend  to –   
 
(a) seven years in case the offence in which false information is 
given is punishable with death;  
 
(b) five years in case the offence in which false information is 
given is punishable with imprisonment for life; or  
 
(c) one-fourth of the longest term of imprisonment or with fine as 
is provided for the offence in which false information is given and 
such offence is not covered under clause (a) or clause (b).]1  
3. 
 
The object of section 182 PPC is to stop an individual 
from giving any false information to a public servant, or such 
information which he believes to be false, with the intent to mislead 
him to do anything (or omit to do anything) which he ought not. 
Section 21 PPC defines the term “public servant.” Section 195(1)(a) 
Cr.P.C. sets out the procedure for prosecuting the offence under 
section 182 PPC. It states that no court shall take cognizance thereof 
except on the complaint in writing of the public servant concerned or 
some other public servant to whom he is subordinate. 
4. 
 
Section 182 PPC has come up for consideration before 
the courts in several cases. In Aurangzeb v. The State  
(1994 SCMR 1280), the appellant filed a complaint before the 
Divisional Commissioner, who forwarded it to the Deputy 
Commissioner without taking action or giving any direction. The 
Deputy Commissioner took cognizance of the complaint and 
appointed an Inquiry Officer, who examined the witnesses produced 
by the parties and determined that the complaint was false. The 
Inquiry Officer submitted his report to the Deputy Commissioner 
because he had ordered the inquiry. The report was not forwarded to 
                                                 
1 Substituted by Act IV of 2017 (w.e.f. 16.02.2017)

the Commissioner for action. The Deputy Commissioner reviewed it 
and directed that a complaint be filed against the appellant under 
section 182 PPC. The appellant’s counsel contended that it was 
incompetent because the Deputy Commissioner was subordinate to 
the Commissioner, not his superior. A complaint under section 
195(1)(a) Cr.P.C. could be brought by the public servant concerned or 
by another public servant to whom he is subordinate. The Supreme 
Court of Pakistan ruled that the Commissioner was not required to 
issue the directive. In the facts and circumstances of the case, the 
Deputy Commissioner was the officer concerned.2  
5. 
 
In 
Qutab 
Din 
v. 
The 
State 
and 
another  
(2002 PCr.LJ 366), this Court ruled that the public servant concerned 
is the one to whom the false information was given with an intent to 
cause him to use his lawful power to the detriment of another person. 
In this case, the accused had submitted an application with the 
Inspector-General of Police which was found to be false on inquiry. 
However, the complaint was filed by the SP Discipline though 
approved by the DIG. It was held both of them lacked competence. 
Only the IGP was authorized to make a complaint to the Magistrate 
for action against him under section 182 PPC. Accordingly, the 
complaint was quashed, leaving it open for the IGP to make a fresh 
one in accordance with the law. In Nasir Ali v. Station House Officer, 
Police Station Civil Lines, Rawalpindi (PLJ 2012 Lahore 760), the 
petitioner submitted an application to the CPO upon which FIR was 
registered but it was found false during investigation. The High Court 
held that CPO was the competent authority for making a complaint 
before the Magistrate for penal action under section 182 PPC, and the 
SHO could not do so in his stead.  
6. 
 
In Haji Muhammad Aslam v. Inspector General and 
others (PLD 2001 Lahore 84), the Magistrate discharged the accused 
of the FIR and directed the Investigating Officer to proceed against 
the complainant according to law for nominating innocent people in 
the said case. The High Court set aside the second part of the 
                                                 
2 The Supreme Court approved Nasim Akhtar Soofi v. The State (1990 PCr.LJ 336), Abdul Hanan v. The State  
(1990 PCr.LJ 777), Muhammad Boota Anjum v. The State (1990 PCr.LJ 1538), Nizamuddin Samejo and others v. 
Sub-Divisional Magistate and others (1988 PCr.LJ 988), Sher Muhammad v. Emperor (AIR 1940 Lahore 15), and 
Daulat Ram v. State of Punjab (AIR 1962 SC 1206).

Magistrate’s order, holding that the prerogative for initiating 
proceedings under section 182 PPC lies only with the police officer 
through whom the legal process was initiated against the accused 
persons. The Magistrate’s role ended when he agreed with the police’s 
report and discharged the accused. The directive to proceed against 
the complainant/first informant was beyond his authority. The 
relevant excerpt is reproduced below: 
 
“It is the public servant to whom a false information is given by a 
person knowing it to be false, who thereafter, moves the machinery 
of law against the accused person to his detriment or to the injury 
or annoyance of the accused person. The framers of law left the 
question for determination to the public servant, as to how far 
powers exercised, by him cause detriment annoyance and injury to 
the person proceeded against as accused in consequence of the 
false information given to him by the complainant. It is not for any 
other authority to direct the concerned police officer to proceed 
against the first informant who is giving false information.”  
 
 
 
The Court explained: 
 
“There may be cases where due to mistake of fact wrong person 
may have been named and this mistake can only be rectified if a 
chance is given to the complainant before proceedings against him 
to show cause as to why action may be taken. In the present case 
the occurrence took place in the dark hours of the night, possibility 
of mistaken identity cannot be ruled out, therefore, the Magistrate 
instead of directing the police officer authoritatively to proceed 
against complainant for nominating innocent persons in the FIR, 
should have left it to the discretion of the concerned police officer 
to use his prerogative if he so desired strictly in accordance with 
law. It may be pertinent to mention at this juncture that 
complainant was medically examined the next day and found to 
suffer six injuries caused by blunt weapons meaning thereby that 
some occurrence took place. His direction curtailed the 
independent exercise of will by the concerned police officers.”  
 
7. 
 
In Khan Ghulam Qadir Khan Khakwani v. A.K. Khalid 
[PLD 1960 (W.P.) Lahore 1039], the Magistrate filed a complaint 
under section 182 Cr.P.C. under the direction of the Deputy 
Commissioner. B.Z. Kaikaus J. held that the officer who files a 
complaint must make his own decision. He cannot lodge a complaint 
under the order of someone else.  
8. 
 
The law is very well settled that before taking action 
under section 182 PPC, the person sought to be prosecuted should be 
served with a show cause notice and he may be given an opportunity 
to explain his position/defence. In Haji Muhammad Aslam, supra, this 
Court stated: 

Writ Petition No.598/2023

“In most of the cases, the matter can be truncated after 
consideration of the reply. If the reply is satisfactory and convinces 
the public servant that information given to him was based on 
mistake of fact or other plausible reason the proceedings can be 
dropped.”3  
9. 
 
Section 25 Cr.P.C. provides for the appointment of  
Ex-officio Justice of Peace. It states that by virtue of their respective 
offices, the Sessions Judges and, on nomination by them, the 
Additional Sessions Judges are Justices of Peace within and for the 
whole of the district of the Province in which they are serving. Section 
22-A(6) Cr.P.C. describes their powers. There is no doubt that the  
Ex-officio Justice of Peace can issue directions to the police 
authorities, and they are bound to comply with them, but they are not 
subordinate to him within the contemplation of section 195(1)(a) 
Cr.P.C. Hence, he cannot direct a police officer to initiate action under 
section 182 PPC. In Amanat Masih v. Additional Sessions Judge, 
Kasur, and 4 others (PLD 2007 Lahore 53), this Court held that the 
Ex-officio Justice of Peace could only pass an order directing 
registration of a criminal case if a cognizable offence was made out 
from the contents of the application or decline the same. The direction 
given to the SHO by the learned Ex-officio Justice of Peace to initiate 
proceedings against the petitioner under section 182 PPC is beyond 
the purview of section 22-A Cr.P.C., hence in excess of the 
jurisdiction conferred upon him under the law.  
10. 
 
In the present case, the Ex-officio Justice of Peace has 
rightly held that he has no jurisdiction to direct the Respondent SHO 
to proceed against Respondents No.5 & 6 under section 182 PPC. The 
Impugned Order dated 23.12.2022 is, therefore, upheld. This petition 
is dismissed in limine.

3 The Court relied upon the following cases for this holding: Muhammad Murad v. The State (1983 PCr.LJ 1097); 
Sarwar Begum v. The State (1974 PCr.LJ Note 114 at page 73), Khan Ghulam Qadir Khan Khakwani v. A.K. Khalid 
[PLD 1960 (W.P.) Lahore 1039] and Mian Fazal Ahmad v. The State (PLD 1970 Lahore 726).
