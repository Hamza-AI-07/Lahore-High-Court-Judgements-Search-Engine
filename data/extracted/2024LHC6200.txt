Through this petition filed under section 561-A 
Cr.P.C. the petitioners have assailed the vires of the order 
dated 08.06.2024 passed by the learned Additional 
Sessions Judge, Jalalpur Pirwala, District Multan.   
2. 
The brief facts of the case leading to the filing of 
the instant petition are that the petitioners were named as 
accused in the case F.I.R. No.761 of 2021 registered at 
Police Station Jalalpur Pirwala, District Multan on the 
information of the respondent No.2 and after the 
investigation of the case, the report under section 173 
Cr.P.C. was submitted and the petitioners were 
summoned to face the trial of the case and the learned 
trial court framed the charge against the accused on 
15.11.2022 to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed 
trial, however,  on 28.10.2023 the petitioners submitted 
an application under section 249-A Cr.P.C. seeking their 
acquittal  from the charge as framed against them and the

Crl. Misc. No.6425-M of 2024 
 
 
learned Magistrate Jalalpur Pirwala on the same day 
allowed the said application and directed the acquittal of 
the petitioners from the charge framed against them 
which order was assailed by the respondent No.2 by way 
of filing a criminal revision petition which criminal 
revision petition was allowed by the  learned Additional 
Sessions Judge, Jalalpur Pirwala vide his order dated 
08.06.2024 with a direction to the learned trial Court to 
retry the petitioners. 
3. 
The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted 
that the order dated 08.06.2024 passed by the learned 
Additional Sessions Judge, Jalalpur Pirwala was violative 
of the provisions of section 417 and 439 sub-section (5) 
Cr.P.C., therefore, was not sustainable.  
4.    The learned Additional Prosecutor General submitted 
that the learned Additional Sessions Judge had no 
authority under the law to have passed the impugned 
order.   
5.  The learned counsel for the respondent No.2 
submitted that as no evidence has been recorded till the 
order was passed by the learned Magistrate, therefore, the 
correct procedure was followed by the learned Additional 
Sessions Judge while passing the impugned order.  
6. 
I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, 
the learned counsel for the respondent No.2, the learned 
Additional Prosecutor General and perused the record 
with their able assistance. 
7. 
 A perusal of the record reveals that the petitioners 
were named as accused in the case F.I.R. No.761 of 2021 
registered at Police Station Jalalpur Pirwala, District 
Multan on the information of the respondent No.2 and 
after the investigation of the case, the report under

Crl. Misc. No.6425-M of 2024 
 
 
section 173 Cr.P.C. was submitted and the petitioners 
were summoned to face the trial of the case and the 
learned trial court framed the charge against the accused 
on 15.11.2022 to which they pleaded not guilty and 
claimed trial, however,  on 28.10.2023 the petitioners 
submitted an application under section 249-A Cr.P.C. 
seeking their acquittal  from the charge as framed against 
them and the learned Magistrate Jalalpur Pirwala on the 
same day allowed the said application and directed the 
acquittal of the petitioners from the charge framed 
against them which order was assailed by the respondent 
No.2 by way of filing a criminal revision petition which 
criminal revision petition was allowed by the  learned 
Additional Sessions Judge, Jalalpur Pirwala vide his 
order dated 08.06.2024 with a direction to the learned 
trial Court to retry the petitioners. The provisions of the 
law with regard to the acquittal of an accused during the 
trial held by a Magistrate are very clear in their meaning. 
It has been provided under section 417 Cr.P.C., that if an 
accused is acquitted in a case, a person aggrieved by the 
order of acquittal passed by any court other than a High 
Court may within 30 days file an appeal against such 
order and the Public Prosecutor may also present an 
appeal to the High Court from the order of acquittal 
passed by any court other than a High Court. The 
provisions of section 417 Cr.P.C read as under:- 
“4l7. Appeal in case of acquittal. 
 
(1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (4), the Provincial 
Government may, in any case, direct the Public Prosecutor to present 
an appeal to the High Court from an original or appellate order of 
acquittal passed by any Court other than a High Court. 
 
(2) If such an order of acquittal is passed in any case instituted upon 
complaint and the High Court, on an application made to it by the 
complainant in this behalf, grants special leave to appeal from the order 
of acquittal, the complainant may present such an appeal to the High 
Court. 
 
(2A) A person aggrieved by the order of acquittal passed by any court 
other than a High Court, may, within thirty days, file an appeal against 
such order.

Crl. Misc. No.6425-M of 2024 
 
 
 
(3) No application under subsection (2) for the grant of special leave to 
appeal from an order of acquittal shall be entertained by the High Court 
after the expiry of sixty days from the date of that order. 
(4) If, in any case, the application under subsection (2) for the grant of 
special leave to appeal from an order of acquittal is refused, no appeal 
from that order of acquittal shall lie under subsection (1) 
 
(5) An appeal against an order of conviction or acquittal under section 
354A, 376, 376A, 377 or 377B of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 (Act 
XLV of 1860) shall be decided within six months.” 
 
It is also a fact that under section 439 sub-section (5) 
Cr.P.C., it has been expressly provided by law that where 
under the Cr.P.C., an appeal lies then no proceedings by 
way of revision shall be entertained at the instance of the 
party who could have appealed. Section 439 read as 
under:- 
“439. High Court’s powers of revision. 
 
(1) In the case of any proceeding the record of which has been 
called for by itself or which otherwise comes to its knowledge, 
the High Court may, in its discretion, exercise any of the powers 
conferred on a Court of Appeal by sections 423, 426, 427 and 
428 or on a Court by section 338, and may enhance the sentence; 
and, when the Judges composing the Court of Revision are 
equally divided in opinion, the case shall be disposed of in 
manner provided by section 429. 
 
(2) No order under this section shall be made to the prejudice of 
the accused unless he has had an opportunity of being heard 
either personally or by pleader in his own defence. 
 
(3) Where the sentence dealt with under this section has been 
passed by a Magistrate the Court shall not inflict a greater 
punishment for the offence which, in the opinion of such Court, 
the accused has committed than might have been inflicted for 
such offence by a Magistrate of the first class. 
 
(4) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorize a High 
Court—(a) to convert a finding of acquittal into one of 
conviction; or (b) to entertain any proceedings in revision with 
respect to an order made by the Sessions 
Judge under section 439A. 
 
(5) Where under this Code an appeal lies and no appeal is 
brought, no proceedings by way of revision shall be 
entertained at the instance of the party who could have 
appealed. 
 
(6) Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, any 
convicted person to whom an opportunity has been given under 
subsection (2) of showing cause why his sentence should not be 
enhanced shall, in showing cause, be entitled also to show cause 
against his conviction.” (emphasis supplied)

Crl. Misc. No.6425-M of 2024 
 
 
In this particular case the petitioners were acquitted in the 
case F.I.R. No.761 of 2021 registered at Police Station 
Jalalpur Pirwala, District Multan and, therefore, the 
respondent No.2, the complainant of the case, had to file 
an appeal against their acquittal under section 417 
Cr.P.C., however, proceeded to file a criminal revision 
petition which was not even permissible under the 
provisions of section 439 sub-section (5) Cr.P.C. 
Furthermore, the learned Additional Sessions Judge while 
accepting the said criminal revision petition also erred in 
law and exercised jurisdiction which he did not have. It 
does not matter whether the acquittal of an accused in a 
case has been ordered after the recording of evidence or 
without recording of evidence and as it is an acquittal in a 
case therefore an appeal has to be filed under section 417 
Cr.P.C. . No proceedings by way of criminal revision 
petition under section 439 Cr.P.C. are envisaged in a case 
where accused has been acquitted by any court other than 
a High Court. This Court in the case of Mst. Bahisht Bibi  
Versus Maqbool Ahmad and 5 others (2003 P Cr. L J 768 
) has already held as under :- 
“The respondents were tried in a private complaint and 
acquitted vide order, dated 22‑11‑1999 against which order 
the petitioner had a remedy under section 417(2), Cr.P.C. 
before this Court by tiling petition for special leave to 
appeal instead of filing this application the petitioner opted 
to file revision petition in the Court of learned Additional 
Sessions Judge which was dismissed and now this revision 
petition has been filed. Basically the order of acquittal 
dated 22‑11‑1999 passed in the private complaint tiled by 
the petitioner has been challenged in this revision petition 
and the same is not maintainable under subsection (5) of 
section 439, Cr.P.C. which provides that where, under this 
Code an appeal lies and no appeal is brought, no 
proceedings by way of revision shall be entertained at the 
instance of the party who could have appealed.”

Crl. Misc. No.6425-M of 2024 
 
 
In the case of  MST. MAMOONA AKHTAR VERSUS 
MAGISTRATE SECTION 30, WAZIRABAD, DISTRICT 
GUJRANWALA and 2 others (2005 M L D 896) this 
Court  has held as under :- 
“After going through the aforesaid provisions of law and 
the citations, I am of the considered view that no revision 
is competent before the Sessions Court against an order, 
which is challengeable in appeal under section 417(2-A), 
Cr.P.C. As the petitioner had been acquitted of the charge 
under section 249-A, Cr.P.C. by the learned Magistrate 
Section 30, the remedy of filing an appeal was available to 
the complainant and the revision petition was not 
competent, so the impugned judgment dated 15-4-1996 is 
declared to be without any lawful authority and as such of 
no legal effect.” 
In the case of  GHULAM MUHAMMAD Versus 
ADDITIONAL SESSIONS JUDGE and 3 others (1998 M 
L D 1605) this Court  has held as under :- 
“The remedy of appeal was available to the petitioner 
against the order of the Trial Court acquitting the accused 
while exercising power under section 249-A, Cr.P.C. The 
petitioner failed to file an appeal against the order of the 
Magistrate. The Additional Sessions Judge was justified in 
dismissing the revision vide impugned order dated 7-8-
1996.” 
 
In the case of  MUHAMMAD AKRAM versus 
ADDITIONAL SESSIONS JUDGE, RAWALPINDI  and 6 
others (2005 Y L R 1037) this Court  has held as under :- 
“9-A. In the instant case, the learned Judicial Magistrate 
though used the word discharge by accepting the 
application under section 249-A, of the Cr.P.C. it will be 
read as acquittal. As learned Single Judge of this Court, as 
he then was, in the case of  Muhammad Yasin v. 
Muhammad Hanif and others 1997 PCr.LJ 1626, found 
remarkable difference between the acquittal recorded 
under section 245, Cr.P.C. and one under section 249-A, of 

 
7 
 
Crl. Misc. No.6425-M of 2024 
 
 
the Cr.P.C. In his view, if evidence is not  recorded and an 
order of acquittal is passed under section 249-A, Cr.P.C., it 
is amenable to the revisional jurisdiction of the Sessions 
Judge, but, in case acquittal is recorded after prosecution 
evidence and examining of the accused an appeal will lie  
under section 417, of the Cr.P.C. I have not been able to 
persuade myself with the view expressed by the learned 
Single Judge in the above case in view of the clear and 
unambiguous language used in section 249-A of the 
Cr.P.C. providing acquittal at any stage of the case, if the 
charge is groundless. Even otherwise, acquittal recorded 
by the competent Court of law on recording of evidence or 
without recording of evidence, will not determine the 
remedy of revision or appeal, but the same is governed by 
statutory provisions of law. After introduction of 
subsection (2-A) in    section 417 of the Cr.P.C. any person 
aggrieved  by  an  order  of  acquittal  has  been conferred 
a right to file an appeal against the acquittal. In presence 
of remedy by way of appeal, the revision is not competent 
under   section 439(5) of the Cr.P.C.” 
 
8. 
In view of the above discussion, this petition is 
allowed and the order dated 08.06.2024 passed by 
learned Additional Sessions Judge, Jalalpur Pirwala is set 
aside. Obviously the respondent No.2 shall be at liberty 
to avail the remedy available to her under the law to 
assail the acquittal of the petitioners by way of filing an 
appeal against the said order in accordance with the law.
