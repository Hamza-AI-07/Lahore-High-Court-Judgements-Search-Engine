MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.- Through 
instant appeal, appellant has called into question judgment dated 
11.11.2022, 
passed 
by 
learned 
Single 
Bench, 
whereby 
constitutional petition, filed by respondent-LDA, challenging 
respondent No.2’s order dated 13.03.2020, de-notifying land 
measuring 04-Kanal comprising Khasra No.11349, situated in 
Mauza Niaz Baig, Tehsil City, District Lahore from the land 
acquired by respondent-LDA for establishment of Muhammad Ali 
Johar Town Scheme, was allowed.  
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that process for acquiring land for a 
Housing Scheme known as Muhammad Ali Johar Town was 
initiated by the respondent-LDA under Section 13(2) of the Lahore 
Development Act, 1975, which was followed by a Gazette 
Notification dated 28.08.1980. On 06.11.1980, a notification under 
Section 4(1) of the Punjab Acquisition of Land (Housing) Act, 1973 
(“the Act of 1973”), gazetted on 10.11.1980, was issued for the 
information of general public whereby land in dispute was also 
acquired for establishment of aforesaid Housing Scheme including

Khasra No.11349. On 05.01.1981, a notification under Section 13 
of the Act of 1973 for the acquisition of land including Khasra 
No.11349 was issued after issuance of public notice under Section 
6(1) of the Act of 1973 ibid, which was gazetted on 05.02.1981. 
Appellant filed an application on 17.06.2019 for correction of 
Revenue record of Khasra No.11349 of Mauza Niaz Baig, Lahore 
to respondent No.2, who accepted the application vide impugned 
order dated 13.03.2020 and excluded the land measuring 04-Kanal 
comprising Khasra No.11349 situated in Mauza Niaz Baig, Tehsil 
City, District Lahore from the acquired land for the above Housing 
Scheme. Learned Single Judge, after hearing arguments of learned 
counsel for the parties, vide judgment dated 11.11.2022 proceeded 
to 
allow 
LDA’s 
constitutional 
petition 
and 
set 
aside 
Commissioner’s order dated 13.03.2020. Hence, instant appeal.  
3. 
Learned counsel for appellant while referring to Section 19 of 
the Act of 1973 (pari materia to Section 48(1) of the Land 
Acquisition Act 1894) submits that respondent-LDA has no 
jurisdiction to exclude the land as the Act of 1973 has been 
repealed by the Punjab Acquisition of Land (Housing) (Repeal) 
Act, 1985 (“the Repeal Act of 1985”). He adds that Section 3 of 
the Repeal Act of 1985 provides that in case, the proceedings have 
commenced under the Act of 1973, same shall continue 
notwithstanding the repeal and such proceedings shall be completed 
under the provisions of said Act and the rules made thereunder. He 
adds that the first proviso of Section 3 provides that in case an 
award has not been made under Section 7 of the Act ibid at the time 
of commencement of this Act, compensation in such a case shall be 
assessed, awarded and paid under the provisions of the Land 
Acquisition Act, 1894 (“the Act of 1894”). He argues that Section 
48-A of the Act of 1894, inserted in law by the Punjab Town 
Improvement Act, 1922, provides that where the award has not 
been made within one year after the publication of the declaration 
of Section 6, the owner would be entitled to the damages in 

 
 
ICA No.26642 of 2023

consequence of the delay and in turn, reading Section 48-A & 48 
together would mean that mere issuance of notification under 
Sections 4 & 6 of the Act of 1894 in itself would not vest the 
property in Government / Agency. He maintains that in this case, 
notification under Section 13 of the Act of 1973 was issued on 
05.02.1981 commanding that respondent-LDA required possession 
of the land immediately within 24-hours of the publication of 
notice, therefore, respondent-LDA was authorized to enter upon the 
land and take possession, however, neither possession was taken 
nor compensation was paid, even otherwise, acquisition cannot be 
undertaken in the manner detrimental to the owner’s right. He states 
that it is mandated by the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 and detailed in Section 23 that the land owner gets 
the best market value since the compensation is a basic right which 
means that the land owner does not lose any financial advantage 
that it has on account of proprietary rights, whereas it has been 
around 42-years by now that admittedly no compensation was paid. 
In the end, he has relied upon Government of Pakistan through 
Secretary Ministry of Defence Rawalpindi and another v. Akhtar 
Ullah Khan Khattak and others (PLD 2024 Supreme Court 218) 
and Liaqat Ali v. District Collector, Gujrat and 4 others (2022 
MLD 1195).  
4. 
Contrarily, learned Law Officer duly assisted by learned 
Legal Advisor for respondent-LDA defends the impugned judgment 
by contending that appellant has failed to pinpoint any illegality or 
legal infirmity therein, thus, no interference is warranted.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused. 
6. 
Record shows that respondent-LDA, by way of filing 
constitutional petition, challenged Commissioner’s order dated 
13.03.2020 whereby appellant’s petition was allowed and land in 
question was de-notified and subject acquired land was excluded 
from the land acquired by the respondent-LDA for the purpose of 
establishment of Muhammad Ali Johar Town Scheme. Learned 

 
 
ICA No.26642 of 2023

Single Judge while relying upon various esteemed judgments of the 
Hon’ble Superior Courts in general and judgment of this Court 
reported as Wali Rehman v. The Additional Commissioner 
(Revenue) Gujranwala Division & 7 others (2022 CLC 106) in 
particular, concluded as under:- 
“9. 
From the above, it is established that the Commissioner, 
Lahore Division, Lahore did not consider the law applicable on the 
case and the dictum laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan as well as that of this Court and passed the impugned order 
which suffers from patent illegality, irregularity and without jurisdiction, 
as such, the se deserves reversal.  
10. 
Resultantly, this writ petition is allowed and order dated 
13.03.2020 passed by the Commissioner, Lahore Division, Lahore is 
hereby set aside being passed without jurisdiction.” 
7. 
The question for our determination is whether the power to 
issue the notification de-notifying the land was available with 
respondent No.2 in terms of Section 48 of the Act of 1894. For 
facility of reference, Section 48 ibid is reproduced hereunder:- 
“48. Completion of acquisition not compulsory, but compensation to 
be awarded when not completed---(1) Except in the case, provided 
for in Section 36, the Commissioner shall be at liberty to withdraw 
from the acquisition of any land of which possession has not been 
taken. 
(2) Whenever the Commissioner withdraws from any such 
acquisition, the Collector shall determine the amount of 
compensation due for the damage suffered by the owner in 
consequence of the notice or of any proceedings thereunder, and 
shall pay such amount to the person interested, together with all 
costs reasonably incurred by him in the prosecution of the 
proceedings under this Act relating to the said land. 
(3) The provisions of Part III of this Act shall apply, so far as may 
be, to the determination of the compensation payable under this 
section.” 
8. 
A bare reference to subsection (1) of Section 48 will show 
that the Commissioner is at liberty to withdraw from the 
acquisition of any land “of which possession has not been taken.” 
Whenever any such withdrawal is made, the landowner is entitled 
to compensation for any damage he suffers, to be determined per 
subsection (2) of Section 48. Thus, on a plain reading, the power 
of the Commissioner to withdraw from the acquisition of any 
land is unfettered till possession has been taken. As such, the Act 

 
 
ICA No.26642 of 2023 
 
5
of 1894, contemplates that once possession has been taken, 
acquisition is complete, and the Commissioner can no longer 
exercise the power to withdraw. It is implicit that after possession 
has been taken, the land is vested in the Government, and the 
notifications issued prior to it cannot be cancelled under Section 
21 of the General Clauses Act, 1897.  
9. 
It is now to be seen what kind of possession, in the scheme 
of the Land Acquisition Act of 1894, constitutes the terminus 
point for Section 48. In our view, it must be actual possession of 
the land, as all interests in the land are sought to be acquired. 
There can be no question of taking “notional” or “symbolical” 
possession, nor would possession merely on paper be enough. It 
ought to be either under Section 16 or 17 of the Act. Section 16 
reads as follows:- 
“16. Power to take possession---When the Collector has made an 
award under Section 11, he may, subject to the provision of Section 
31, take possession of the land, which shall there-upon vest 
absolutely in the Government free from all encumbrances.” 
10. 
Since the respondent-LDA had neither taken possession of 
the land nor award was announced under Section 11 of the Act of 
1894, the acquisition had not become past and closed, which may 
denude the Commissioner of the right to withdraw, rescind, recall 
or amend any notification regarding the acquisition. The Act of 
1894, does not permit to withdraw a land from the acquisition 
process once possession is obtained, however, scenario is 
different in this case. The landowners could not be left in a 
quandary. It is apparent from record that respondent-LDA issued 
notification under Section 13(2) of the LDA Act, 1975 on 
28.08.1980 as well as under Sections 4, 6(1) & 13 of the Act of 
1973 for acquisition of the said land for the purpose of 
Muhammad Ali Johar Town Housing Scheme, however, 04-
Kanal land out of Khasra No.11349, whereof appellant claims to 
be owner, was neither acquired by respondent-LDA nor he or his 
predecessor-in-interest received any compensation for such 

 
 
ICA No.26642 of 2023

acquisition. However, the land in question is included in 
notification dated 06.11.1980 issued under Section 4 and 
notification No.269 dated 05.01.1981 issued under Section 13 of 
the Act of 1894. Whereas there is no denying to the fact that 
award of said Khasra was not announced and proceedings to 
acquire its possession were initiated to the extent of 01-Kanal 15-
Marla only, which does not include appellant’s land. A party 
cannot be expected to wait indefinitely, as the Government 
acquires its valuable right to the immovable property. If the 
Government or its acquiring department did not have the funds, it 
should have made up its mind quickly and that too before taking 
possession and told the landowners where they stood. The land 
acquisition process started decades ago, however, the landowners 
have been struggling to get their legitimate rights. Based on these 
facts, no law can condone the indolence of the respondent-LDA. 
Therefore, the Commissioner, Lahore Division, Lahore / 
respondent No.2 was justified to de-notify appellant’s land 
measuring 04-Kanal comprising Khasra No.11349, taking into 
account the conduct of respondent-LDA. Reliance is placed upon 
Government of Pakistan through Secretary Ministry of Defence 
Rawalpindi and another v. Akhtar Ullah Khan Khattak and others 
(PLD 2024 Supreme Court 218).  
11. 
In view of the above, instant appeal is allowed. 
Consequently, impugned judgment dated 11.11.2022 is set aside.
