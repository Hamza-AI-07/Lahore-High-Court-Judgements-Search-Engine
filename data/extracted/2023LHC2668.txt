Petitioners by 
Mr. Naveed Ahmad Khawaja, Advocate. 
Ms. Nelufar Khan, Advocate. 
Ch. Anwar Ali Sangha and Miss Sdaqet 
Nazir Tarar, Advocates. 
Respondents by  
Ch. Imran Raza Chadhar, Advocate.

ABID AZIZ SHEIKH, J. This judgment will also 
decide the connected Writ Petition Nos.27703, 27704, 28878 
and 29444 of 2023 as common questions of law and facts are 
raised therein. In these Petitions, the petitioners have 
challenged two transfer orders of even date i.e. 11.03.2023 
(impugned transfer orders) to their extent, passed by the 
Secretary, Local Government & Community Development 
Department (LG&CDD), Government of Punjab/Chairman 
Punjab Local Government Board, (respondent No.2). The 
petitioners have also challenged three separate impugned 
orders 
dated 
20.04.2023, 
26.04.2023 
& 
03.05.2023

(impugned orders) passed by the Chief Secretary, Civil 
Secretariat, Lahore (respondent No.1), whereby their 
respective representations were declined. 
2. 
The relevant facts, which are more or less identical in 
all these Writ Petitions, are that the petitioners are employees 
of the LG&CDD, Punjab and posted as Chief Officers & 
District Officers at Municipal Corporation and District 
Councils. Through both the impugned transfer orders total 
193 employees/officers of the local government, including 
the petitioners, have been transferred. In the earlier round of 
litigation, some of these matters were referred to respondent 
No.1, however, the representations of those petitioners have 
been declined through the impugned orders, hence, these 
Constitutional Petitions. 
3. 
The learned counsel for the petitioners submit that 
under Section 186 of the Punjab Local Government Act 
(XXXIII), 2022 (hereinafter will be referred to as Act 
XXXIII of 2022), the minimum tenure of two years has been 
provided, and therefore the impugned transfer orders could 
not be passed before expiry of two years’ prescribed tenure. 
He submits that similar tenure was prescribed under the 
previous laws, including the Punjab Local Government 
Board Transfer Policy dated 26th May, 1998 (Transfer

Policy), which prescribed tenure of three years. Submits that 
in the impugned orders passed by respondent No.1, it is 
stated that as elections could not take place under the Act 
XXXIII of 2022, therefore, the provisions of the Punjab 
Local Government Act, 2013 (Act of 2013) will apply, 
wherein no tenure has been prescribed. Contends that this 
reasoning is fallacious because various instructions issued by 
respondent-department (in letters appended with CM 
No.3/2023) show that the directions were issued under the 
Act XXXIII of 2022 and not under the Act of 2013. He 
finally submits that the Punjab Local Government Service 
(Appointment & Conditions of Service) Rules, 2018 (Rules) 
are subservient to the provisions of the Act XXXIII of 2022, 
and in case of any inconsistency Section 186 of the Act 
XXXIII of 2022 will prevail. He placed reliance on “Syed 
Mahmood Akhtar Naqvi and others Vs. Federation of 
Pakistan and others” (PLD 2013 Supreme Court 195) and 
“Province of Punjab through Conservator of Forest, 
Faisalabad and others Vs. Javed Iqbal” (2021 SCMR 328). 
Learned counsel for the petitioner in connected matter beside 
pleading hardship reiterated the above submissions.  
4. 
Learned Law Officer, on the other hand, submits that 
in most of these cases, the petitioners remained at the same

place of posting for more than two years but under different 
nomenclatures due to de-limitations or demarcations of the 
area under different local government laws, remained in 
force from time to time. To illustrate he submits that the 
petitioner in this petition (Ashfaq Ahmad) remained in 
District Gujrat from 10.11.2018 till 02.06.2022 for more than 
three and half year, but thereafter was transferred to District 
Chakwal on 03.06.2022 and to District Mandi Bahaudin on 
27.06.2022 but just within a period of one month he was 
transferred back to Gujrat on 28.07.2022. He submits that the 
said petitioner never challenged his two previous transfer 
orders but only challenged the impugned transfer order by 
abusing the provision for protection of tenure. He further 
submits that under Rule 11 of the Rules and Section 187(3) 
of the Act XXXIII of 2022, the employees of the local 
government shall be liable to serve anywhere within the 
province, therefore, the impugned transfer orders are lawfully 
passed under the aforesaid laws. Further submits that under 
Sections 204 & 205 of the Act XXXIII of 2022, the offices, 
agencies and authorities of the defunct local government, 
established under the Act of 2013, alongwith the officers will 
continue to discharge their respective duties, therefore, the 
provisions of the Act XXXIII of 2022, including Section

186, shall not apply unless local governments are established 
under the Act XXXIII of 2022. Concludes that under Section 
186 of the Act XXXIII of 2022, the security of tenure is 
available to Chief Officers or such other officers of the local 
government, as may be specified by the Secretary, 
LG&CDD, Punjab (Secretary) from time to time, but no 
such officers are separately specified by the Secretary under 
Section 186 of the Act ibid, therefore, tenure protection 
under the said Section is not applicable to the employees of 
local government other than the Chief Officers. 
5. 
Learned counsel for the private-respondents in Writ 
Petition Nos.27704 & 29444 of 2023 supported the above 
arguments of learned Law Officer and further submits that 
the petitioners remained at the same place of posting from 
time to time under various nomenclatures for much more 
than two years. 
6. 
I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and 
perused the record with their able assistance. Because of the 
commonality of facts and questions of law in all these 
petitions, it is not necessary to narrate or advert to the facts in 
each case separately. However, the moot question require 
determination in all of these cases, is that whether the 
petitioners who are admittedly employees of the LG&CDD,

Government of Punjab, could be transferred before expiry of 
their ordinary tenure of two years’, prescribed under Section 
186 of the Act XXXIII of 2022. In order to better appreciate 
this baseline question, it is expedient to examine the various 
provisions remained in field relating to the security of tenure 
of the officers of local government from time to time. In this 
context, Article 140A (1) of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (Constitution) pertains to local 
governments and envisages that each province shall, by law, 
establish a local government system and devolve political, 
administrative and financial responsibility and authority to 
the elected representatives of the local governments. In 
pursuance to the aforesaid mandate of the Constitution, the 
Punjab Local Government Ordinance, 1979 (Ordinance of 
1979) was promulgated. Though the Ordinance of 1979 did 
not provide any security of tenure to the officers of local 
government, however, Transfer Policy prescribed tenure of 
three years. Subsequently, the Punjab Local Government 
Ordinance, 2001 (Ordinance of 2001) was introduced 
(which repealed the Ordinance of 1979) and under Section 30 
of the Ordinance of 2001, tenure of posting of officer or 
official of the government to district government was 
prescribed as three years. Afterwards, the Act of 2013

repealed the Ordinance of 2001 but no specific provision was 
prescribed in the Act of 2013 for security of tenure of the 
officers of local government. Later on, the Punjab Local 
Government Act, 2019 (Act of 2019) was passed, which 
repealed the Act of 2013. Under Section 295 of the Act of 
2019, the ordinary tenure of two years’ was provided for the 
Chief Officers and other officers of the local government that 
may be specified by the Government from time to time. 
Thereafter, the Punjab Local Government Ordinance, 2021 
(Ordinance of 2021) was introduced, which repealed the Act 
of 2013 & the Act of 2019, however, the tenure of two years’ 
was retained under Section 186 of the Ordinance ibid. On 
repeal of the Ordinance of 2021, the Punjab Local 
Government Act (XIII), 2022 (Act XIII of 2022) was 
promulgated and under Section 185 thereof, the tenure of two 
years was prescribed. The Act ibid was replaced by the Act 
XXXIII of 2022 and under Section 186 thereof, the security 
of tenure of two years has been prescribed, which provision 
is currently in field.  
7. 
Cursory glance of above mentioned local government 
laws manifests that though the security of tenure for the 
employees/officers of local government was not specifically 
available under the Ordinance of 1979 and the Act of 2013,

however, the Transfer Policy was in field and subsequently 
the Act of 2019, the Ordinance of 2021, the Act XIII of 2022 
and the Act XXXIII of 2022 provided statutory security of 
ordinary tenure of two years to the officers of the local 
government. However, the claim of the respondents is that 
Section 186 of the Act XXXIII of 2022 is only applicable to 
Chief Officers as no other officers are specified by the 
Secretary. It is also argued that as elections did not take place 
and new local governments are not established under the Act 
XXXIII of 2022, therefore, under Sections 204 & 205 of the 
said Act, the provision of the Act of 2013 will remain in field 
and Section 186 of the Act XXXIII of 2022 will not apply.  
8. 
In order to address above legal issues, it is necessary to 
reproduce the Sections 185, 186, 204 & 205 of the Act 
XXXIII of 2022 hereunder:- 
“185.     Chief Officer, other officers and 
servants of local governments.– (1) Every

(2)       All officers of a local government shall 
be appointed by the Secretary in the 
prescribed manner.

done or any action taken under any other 
previously repealed local government law, 
including: 
(a)        every 
proceeding, 
appointment, notification, notice,

(c)        every scheme drawn up,

governments established under the Punjab 
Local Government Act, 2013 (XVIII of 2013) 
shall continue providing public services in 
their respective local areas without any 
interruption 
till 
such 
time 
new 
local 
governments are established under this Act. 
(2)       Subject to any other relevant law, all 
officers and servants of the defunct local 
governments shall continue to discharge their 
respective duties and exercise their powers 
with the successor local governments under 
this Act, till such time they are assigned or 
transferred to any other local government. 
(3)       Nothing in this section shall preclude 
the Government from appropriately re-
organizing the defunct local governments or 
for that matter reorganizing or reassigning 
any other office or authority established under 
the Punjab Local Government Act 2013 (XVIII 
of 2013).” 
 
9. 
Plain reading of Section 186 of the Act XXXIII of 
2022 shows that all Chief Officers and such other officers of 
the local government that may be specified by the Secretary 
from time to time, shall ordinarily hold office for a period of 
not less than two years. This Court is not impressed with the 
argument of the respondents that said provision is only 
applicable to the Chief Officers as other officers have not 
been specified by the Secretary under Section 186 of the Act 
XXXIII of 2022. The aforesaid Section 186 must be read in 
conjunction with Section 185 of the Act ibid, which provides 
that every local government shall have such number of Chief

W.P. No.29444/2023 
 
 
 
Officer from prescribed service and such number and 
description of other officers and servants as the Secretary 
may from time to time determine. Sub-section (2) of Section 
185 of the Act XXXIII of 2022 further provides that all 
officers of a local government shall be appointed by the 
Secretary in the prescribed manner. The words “such other 
officers of the local government that may be specified by the 
Secretary”, mentioned in Section 186 of the Act ibid, are 
actually referring to those other officers who are to be 
“determined” and “appointed” by the Secretary under Section 
185 of the Act XXXIII of 2022, and there is no requirement 
under Section 186 ibid for specifying other officers for 
security of tenure to said officers. It is neither the case of the 
respondents that any such separate list of other officers has 
ever been specified by the Secretary under any of the laws, 
referred above, for security of tenure nor any rules or 
parameters have been framed for the Secretary to specify the 
other officers, only to whom the security of tenure shall be 
available under Section 186 of the Act XXXIII of 2022. If 
the above argument of the respondents is accepted then the 
discretion of the Secretary under Section 186 of the Act 
XXXIII of 2022 will not only be arbitrary being without any

W.P. No.29444/2023 
 
 
 
parameters but same will also be discriminatory and violative 
of the Article 25 of the Constitution.  
10. 
Merely because the word “specified” used in Section 
186 and the words “determined” and “appointed” used in 
Section 185 of the Act XXXIII of 2022, do not mean that the 
other officers determined and appointed by the Secretary 
under Section 185 ibid will be different from “other officers” 
specified by the Secretary under Section 186 of the Act ibid. 
The word “specified”, as defined in Black’s Law Dictionary, 
means to mention specifically; to state in full and explicit 
terms; to point out; to tell or state precisely or in detail. The 
word “appoint” mean to designate, ordain, prescribe, 
nominate, whereas the word “determine” means to bring to 
conclusion, to decide, to settle. When the number and 
description of the other officers is “determined” by the 
Secretary under Section 185(1) of the Act XXXIII of 2022 
and the officers of local government are appointed by him 
under Section 185(2) ibid, this means that the officers have 
been specified for the purpose of Section 186 of the Act ibid. 
The terms “determined” and “appointed” require application 
of mind to determine and appoint officers, whereas the word 
“specified”, is only a ministerial job to mention or specify

those officers determined and appointed, hence, these terms 
are to be read holistically and not in isolation. 
11. 
The next argument of the respondents is that under 
Sections 204 & 205 supra, till such time the new local 
governments are established under the Act XXXIII of 2022 
the provisions including Section 186 of the Act ibid will not 
apply and the Act of 2013 will remain in field. The above 
ground is also recorded in the impugned orders passed by 
respondent No.1. I am afraid that this Court is not in 
agreement with the above reasoning. Plain reading of repeal 
and savings clause (under Section 204) and interim 
authorities and continuation of public service (under Section 
205) of the Act XXXIII of 2022, shows that the Act XIII of 
2022 was repealed, however, the repeal shall not affect 
previous operation of the laws, demarcated and notified 
areas, rights of privileges, penalties, investigations or 
anything done or action taken under the repealed local 
government laws. Section 205 of the Act XXXIII of 2022 
also provides that all offices, agencies and authorities, 
established under the Act XIII of 2022, shall continue 
providing public services and all officers and servants of the 
defunct local government shall continue to discharge their 
respective duties till they are assigned or transferred to any

other local government. However, nowhere in Sections 204 
& 205 of the Act XXXIII of 2022, it is provided that till such 
time the new local governments are established, the 
provisions of the Act XXXIII of 2022, including Section 
186, shall not apply for the security of tenure to the officers 
of local government. The above legal position is also 
supported by the fact that various instructions/orders 
(appended with CM No.1 of 2023) were issued under the Act 
XXXIII of 2022 and not under the Act of 2013. I have also 
found force in the argument of the petitioners that 
notwithstanding the fact that no security of tenure was 
provided under the Act of 2013, however, the Transfer 
Policy remained in field under which the security of tenure 
has been provided. It is not shown that the Transfer Policy 
has been repealed or canceled rather according to 
respondents’ arguments, the same is protected under various 
saving clauses of the local government laws, repealed from 
time to time. Therefore, it cannot be said that the Act XXXIII 
of 2022 shall remain in abeyance till holding of the local 
government elections under the Act ibid. 
12. 
The next argument of the respondents that under 
Section 187(2) of the Act XXXIII of 2022 and Rule 11 of the 
Rules, the employees of local government shall be liable to 

[-16-] 
W.P. No.27703/2023

serve anywhere in the province, and therefore the impugned 
transfer orders are justified, is misconceived. No doubt, 
under Section 187(3) of the Act XXXIII of 2022 and Rule 11 
of the Rules, a member of the local government is liable to 
serve anywhere in the province, however, it does not mean 
that security of tenure of two years, provided under Section 
186 of the Act XXXIII of 2022, shall not be available to the 
officers of the local government. 
13. 
The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of “Syed 
Mahmood Akhtar Naqvi” supra held that when the ordinary 
tenure for posting and transfer has been specified in the law 
or rules made thereunder, such tenure must be respected and 
cannot be varied except for compelling reasons, which 
should be recorded  in writing and are judicially reviewable. 
The Apex Court in “Syed Liaqat Shah Vs. Vice-Chancellor, 
University of Engineering and Technology, Peshawar and 
others” (2019 PLC (C.S.) 74) held that where tenure of 
service of an employee is protected under a law, it cannot be 
curtailed without first initiating and completing disciplinary 
proceedings against him. The same view was also expressed 
by this Court in “Dr. AFTAB AHMAD MALIK Vs. 
UNIVERSITY OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY and 
others” (2005 PLC (C.S.) 80), by the learned Islamabad

14. 
In all afore-noted judgments, the law settled by the 
august Supreme Court of Pakistan as well as by various High 
Courts is that postings and transfers exclusively fall under 
the domain of competent authority and in the exigencies of 
service, transfer and posting can be made but such discretion 
must not be exercised in arbitrary or fanciful manner rather 
same should be exercised judiciously, with equity and fair 
play. Therefore, when ordinary tenure for posting has been

compelling reasons, which should be recorded in writing and 
must be justiciable. Ordinary tenure of two years for 
employees of local government in above mentioned laws 
apparently is in line with Article 140A of the Constitution, 
which envisages establishment of local government system 
to promote good governance, effective delivery of services 
through institutionalized participation of the people at low 
level through local governments and its employees. 
15. 
In the present case, perusal of the impugned transfer 
orders shows that total 193 local government employees, 
including the petitioners, have been transferred with one 
stroke of pen without adhering to the security of tenure, 
prescribed under Section 186 of the Act XXXIII of 2022, or 
giving any compelling reasons in writing for such transfers 
before expiry of two years’ ordinary tenure. The argument of 
learned Law Officer as well as learned counsel for private-
respondents that some of the officials are stationed at one 
place for many years and only got transfer out of district for a 
few days by backdoor influence and again got their transfer 
back to same district and now abusing the protection of 
tenure provided under Section 186 of the Act XXXIII of 
2022, may have substance but none of these grounds or 
reasons has been recorded in their impugned transfer orders

rather on face of it no judicious mind was applied at all 
before passing of the impugned transfer orders, whereby 193 
local government officers have been transferred without any 
determination that how many employees have completed 
their tenure of two years or what are the compelling reasons 
to transfer those employees, who have not yet completed 
their tenure prescribed under the law.  
16. 
In view of above discussion, all these Constitutional 
Petitions are allowed and the impugned transfer orders to the 
extent of the petitioners as well as the impugned orders are 
set-aside being without lawful authority and of no legal 
effect. However, this judgment will not preclude the 
respondents to proceed in the matter afresh in terms of the 
guidelines prescribed by the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan and also discussed in this judgment.
