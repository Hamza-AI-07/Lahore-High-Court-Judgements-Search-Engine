       SULTAN TANVIR AHMAD, J:- Through the 
present judgment, the captioned Intra Court Appeal along-with 
connected appeals bearing numbers 188669 of 2018, 188663 of 
2018, 212729 of 2018, 212730 of 2018, 188666 of 2018, 58851 
of 2020 and 65606 of 2022, filed under section 3 of the Law 
Reforms Ordinance, 1972 and Constitution Petition No. 21507 
of 2020, filed under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973, having common question of law 

ICA No. 56780 of 2020         (Judgment)

and facts shall be decided. The appeals No.212729 and 212730 
of 2018 are filed by the Province of Punjab, whereas, the 
remaining appeals are filed by the private individuals 
(hereinafter called as the „private appellants’).  
2.  
Concise facts of the case are that the Government 
of Punjab invited applications for filling various vacant posts of 
educators including ESE (Science, Math and Arts) through 
advertisement issued by National Testing Service Pakistan. The 
names of petitioners in writ petitions No. 75664 of 2017 and 
64465 of 2017, now private respondents in Intra Court Appeals 
(hereinafter called as the „private respondents’), were reflected 
in the list of successful candidates. Accordingly, their 
appointment agreements were signed and the private 
respondents were sent for training. Thereafter, the agreements 
of the private respondents were suspended through letter dated 
16.08.2017 on account of some error in the software and their 
training was stopped. The private respondents were called to 
report the office of District Education Officer (M-EE), 
Faisalabad on 22.08.2017. Allegedly, due to certain software 
error, as detailed in report and para-wise comments, the private 
respondents were erroneously selected, despite the fact that as 
per the scrutiny by the department, they secured less marks than 
the private  appellants. As a result thereof, the appointments of 
the private respondents were withdrawn and the private 
appellants, being more deserving candidates were appointed as 
ESE (Science, Math and Arts), who joined against their 
respective posts w.e.f. 23.08.2017. Dissatisfied from the above 
position, the private respondents instituted Constitutional 
petitions, which were allowed by the learned Judge-in-
Chambers vide judgment dated 28.02.2018. Aggrieved from the 
said judgment, the titled Intra Court Appeal as well as the 

ICA No. 56780 of 2020         (Judgment) 
 
 
3 
connected appeals have been instituted.  
 
3.  
 
Mr. Junaid Babar Khan, Ms. Sahar Illyas and Mr. 
Shehzad Chaudhary, learned counsel for the private appellants, 
have submitted that  the suspension order dated 16.08.2017 was 
assailed in the writ petition No. 64465 of 2017 while concealing 
the fact that by the time the constitution petition was instituted 
contracts of the private respondents stood withdrawn vide order 
dated 22.08.2017 and the private appellants were issued fresh 
appointments letters against their respective posts; that by 
concealing the same, the  private respondents were deliberately 
avoided to be impleaded in array of parties, which resulted into 
entire confusion, causing injustice to the private appellants, 
who have been condemned unheard, which is also  in violation 
of Article 10-A of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973. It is further contended by the learned counsel 
that it is an admitted position that the private appellants secured 
more marks than the private respondents and they remained 
higher in merit list, thus, by allowing the claim of the 
individuals lower in merit with less marks comparing with the 
private appellants would confer undue advantage, resulting into 
miscarriage of justice. It is further argued that the private 
respondents, through the constitution petition, in essence have 
challenged breach of contract, for which the sole remedy was to 
seek damages in civil Court, as already settled in case titled 
“Qazi MUNIR AHMAD Versus RAWALPINDI MEDICAL 
COLLEGE AND ALLIED HOSPITAL through Principal and 
others”(2019 SCMR 648). 
4.  
 
Learned Law Officer and Mr. Abdul Sattar, Legal 
Advisor, Education Department Faisalabad, have supported the 
case of the private appellants and it is submitted that 
appointment letters of the private appellants have been issued 

ICA No. 56780 of 2020         (Judgment) 
 
 
4 
as per merit and in the absence of any allegation of political 
interference, evidence as to any malafide on the part of the 
Government or respondent-department or for that matter any 
individual officer, the intervention in the constitutional 
jurisdiction, is not warranted.  
5.  
 
Mr. Farrukh Janahangir Wahla and Ch. Jawad 
Mehmood Pasha, learned counsel for the private respondents 
have submitted that upon issuance of appointment letters to the 
private respondents, the principle of locus poenitentiae became 
fully applicable that protected the rights of the private 
respondents; that once the agreements are executed between the 
parties the same cannot be withdrawn, unilaterally. They have 
strongly supported the judgment passed by the learned Judge-
in-Chambers.  
6.  
We have heard the arguments and perused the 
record with the able assistance of learned counsel for the 
parties.  
7. 
Record reflects that process of recruitment of 
educators against various posts including ESE (Science, Math 
and Arts) was initiated, as per recruitment policy 2016/2017, 
through 
advertisement 
in 
daily 
newspapers, 
inviting 
applications until 07.02.2017. The entire process of recruitment 
was completed on software provided by education-department, 
Government of the Punjab. Admittedly, the appointments, on 
contract basis, were to be made against vacant seats in schools 
of particular area and on the basis of school specific merit. Soon 
after the execution of agreements of the private respondents, 
some error in the software was detected, which purportedly 
resulted into selection of candidates having lower marks, as per 
the criteria in the concerned policy. Those securing higher 

ICA No. 56780 of 2020         (Judgment) 
 
 
5 
marks than the appointed candidates could not be appointed due 
to the software error. In para-wise comments filed by District 
Education Officer / respondent No. 2 the software error has 
been explained as follows:- 
 
 
1. 
A candidate apply for the Recruitment 
as Educator for same categories of ESE 
(Arts and Science) in both sides (Male & 
Female) separately, if any short document is 
required by any one side from the candidate, 
he / she provides when it is feeded in the 
software then its entry become in both sides 
(Male & Female). Due to which the 
problems of many kinds are created. 
 
 
2.  
Making selection of the eligible 
candidates in place of demerit candidate, 
the software does not show its selection / 
unselection. 
 
 
3.  
If a candidate apply for two posts ESE 
(Arts and Science), he / she is selected for 
one post, other post is made unblocked, but 
shown blocked. 
 
 
4.  
If any seat of Educator is missing 
from selection, the software does not show it 
even all seats may refresh.  
 
8. 
Upon detection of above error, the District 
Recruitment Committee held meeting on 21.07.2017. This 
meeting was attended by the Chairman of the committee and 
seven other members that included representative of the 
Provincial Government and District Education Officers. They 
unanimously resolved to rectify the merit list and to issue 
appointment contracts in favour of the eligible candidates, as 
per Recruitment Policy, 2016 / 2017.  
9. 
After rectification and detailed analysis, following 
position emerged, as per the report furnished in writ petition 
No.69869 of 2017:-

The above details reflect that the candidates 
appointed, after detection of error in software and rectification 
of the same, secured more marks as per the given criteria for 
their posts in the relevant schools. As already discussed, the 
appointments were to be made on the basis of school specific 
merit. For example, for school located in 19/JB-I, Ms. Sehar 
Tariq d/o Muhammad Tariq has obtained 61.2 marks, whereas, 
earlier (before detection of software error) one Ms. Munazza 
Munawar was given the contract who has actually secured 
60.59 marks, which are less than the marks obtained by Ms. 
Sehar Tariq. Similar is the position of the rest of the candidates.  
11. 
Ch. Muhammad Jahangir Wahla the learned 
counsel for the petitioners in Writ Petition Nos. 75664 of 2017 
and Writ Petition No. 64465 of 2017 has primarily built up his 
case on the basis of principle of locus poenitentiae. A reading 
of the said petitions reflects that the number obtained, as per the 
rectified merit list is not disputed on the basis of any record or 
document but it is stated that once the contracts of employment 
have been issued they could not have been withdrawn keeping in 
view the principle of locus poenitentiae. The same is argued 
before us, today. However, we are of the opinion that if an act is 

ICA No. 56780 of 2020         (Judgment) 
 
 
8 
wrongly done due to some misunderstanding, error or illegality, 
the principle of locus poenitentiae does not come into operation 
to protect such wrong. If foundation of an action is based on an 
illegality or error, the protection of locus poenitentiae cannot be 
provided to beneficiary of said action at cost of others who are 
otherwise placed higher in merit. In this regard, the Honourable 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in case titled “Syed Azam Shah 
Versus Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Cabinet 
Division, Cabinet Secretariat, Islamabad and another”(2022 
SCMR 201) has observed as follows:- 
  “…This Latin phrase is connected with 
contractual 
law 
which 
expresses 
an 
opportunity to withdraw from a contract or 
obligation before it is completed but in our 
comprehension, there is no hard and fast 
rule that if some benefit was wrongly 
extended due to some misunderstanding, 
error, misconception of law or without 
sanction of competent authority, that act 
should be treated so sacred and sacrosanct 
which could not be withdrawn to retrace or 
redo the wrong decision or action under the 
guise of locus poenitentiae principle. A 
wrong benefit extended beyond the scope of 
law and rules/policy cannot be claimed in 
perpetuity or eternity hence the applicability 
of this doctrine depends on the circumstances 
of each and every case and cannot apply 
universally or randomly without adverting to 
the merits of each case in its peculiar 
circumstances. In the case of Engineer-in-
Chief Branch through Ministry of Defence, 
Rawalpindi and another v. Jalaluddin (PLD 
1992 SC 207), this Court held that the order 
under which the payment was made had no 
sanction of law. Locus Poenitentiae is the 
power of receding till a decisive step is taken. 
But it is not a principle of law that order 
once passed becomes irrevocable and it is 
past and closed transaction. If the order is 
illegal then perpetual rights cannot be 

ICA No. 56780 of 2020         (Judgment) 
 
 
9 
gained on the basis of an illegal order…..” 
 
 
 
 
 
       (Emphasis supplied) 
12.        
Further reference can be made to cases titled 
“Province of Punjab through Secretary, Finance Department, 
Civil Secretariat, Lahore and Others Versus Atta Muhammad 
Zafar and Others”(2021 SCMR 1195) and “Muhammad 
Nadeem Arif and Others Versus Inspector-General of Police, 
Punjab, Lahore and Others”(2010 PLC (C.S) 924). Here, It 
will also be beneficial to reproduce the relevant extract of 
“Province of Punjab through Secretary, Finance Department, 
Civil Secretariat, Lahore and Others” case (supra):- 
  
“…We are unfortunately unable to 
agree 
with 
the 
simplistic 
and 
over 
generalized view taken by the High Court in 
the impugned judgment. This Court has in a 
large number of judgments clearly and 
categorically held that locus poeniteniae is 
the power of receding till a decisive step is 
taken but is not a principle of law that an 
order once passed becomes irrevocable and 
it is a past and closed transaction. If an 
order is illegal then, a perpetual right 
cannot be created on the basis of such 
illegal order. In this regard, reference may 
usefully be made to the case of Engineer-in-
chief Branch v. Jalaluddin (PLD 1992 
Supreme Court 207)….” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
13. 
It is equally settled that in the absence of any 
specific evidence or material showing favoritism, political 
interference or departure from merits or malafide established 
through clear evidence, the interference in the process of 
requirements is not warranted by law. Reliance in this regard 
can be placed to the cases titled “Malik Munsif Awan, Advocate 
Chairman, Pakistan Justice Party, Lahore Versus Federation of 
Pakistan through Secretary, Law and Justice, Islamabad and 

ICA No. 56780 of 2020         (Judgment) 
 
 
10 
Others”(PLD 2021 Supreme Court 379) and “Province of 
Punjab through the Director (E.E.), Lahore Division, Lahore 
and Others Versus Muhammad Afzal”(2003 PLC (C.S.) 1434). 
14.  
There is no evidence or document produced before 
us that reflect any favoritism or interference by political 
elements. No material is available on the record leading to 
inference that the relevant education department has appointed 
the private appellants without merit or against the policy or 
rules. The learned counsel of the private respondents could not 
deny that the private appellants do possess the requisite 
qualifications, therefore, we consider it unwarranted to interfere 
in such process of appointments through jurisdiction under 
Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973.  
15.  
 
For the reasons recorded above, the present Intra 
Court Appeal as well as appeals No.188669 of 2018, 188663 of 
2018, 212729 of 2018, 212730 of 2018, 65606 of 2022 and 
188666 of 2018 are allowed and as a consequence thereof, Writ 
Petition Nos. 75664 of 2017 and 64465 of 2017 stand 
dismissed, whereas, Intra Court Appeal No. 58851 of 2020 and 
Writ Petition No. 21507 of 2020 are disposed of in the light of 
above findings. No order as to costs.
