For the petitioner 
Mr. Imran Muhammad Sarwar, Advocate 
For Respondent 
No.1 
Mr. Muhammad Asif Mughal, Advocate.   
 
 
Raheel Kamran J:- Through this petition under 
Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 (“the Constitution”) the petitioner has 
challenged the validity of order dated 12.11.2022 passed by the 
Rent Tribunal, Faisalabad whereby his application for setting 
aside ex-parte proceedings and leave to contest the eviction 
petition was dismissed. 
2.      The facts giving rise to this constitutional petition are that 
respondent No.1 filed an eviction petition wherein notice was 
issued against the petitioner, however, on 14.09.2022 due to his 
non-appearance, ex-parte proceedings were initiated against 
him.  On 06.10.2022, the petitioner moved an application for 
setting aside ex-parte proceedings and leave to contest the 
petition, which was dismissed vide the order impugned herein. 
3.       Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the 
petitioner was never served in the eviction proceedings filed by 
respondent No.1 in accordance with the provisions of sub-
sections (1) and (2) of Section 21 of the Punjab Rented 
Premises Act, 2009 (“the Act”) and the Rent Tribunal, 

2 
W.P.No.75857 of 2022 
Faisalabad erroneously proceeded against him ex-parte on 
14.09.2022 without satisfying the mandatory requirement of 
law qua service of notice. While referring to the orders dated 
07.07.2022 and 02.09.2022, he elaborates that no order to serve 
notice through courier service was passed even though that was 
a mandatory requirement of law under sub-section (1) and there 
was nothing whatsoever available on record to establish that 
copies of the application and the documents annexed therewith 
were served on the petitioner along with the notice in the 
prescribed form, as mandated under sub-section (2) of Section 
21 of the Act. He maintains that while passing the impugned 
order the petitioner has been denied fair trial, which is in 
violation of Article 10-A of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973.  Further contends that the 
application for setting aside ex-parte proceedings has been 
decided in a slipshod manner which hardly shows application 
of judicious mind, therefore, the impugned order is not 
sustainable in law.    
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for respondent No.1 has 
supported the impugned order for the reasons stated therein. 
5. 
Heard. Record perused.  
6. 
For proper appreciation of respective contentions of 
learned counsel for the parties, it would be imperative to refer 
to the provisions of Section 21 of the Act, which read as 
under:- 
“21.   Appearance of parties and consequences of non-
appearance. (1) If an application under this Act other 
than application for deposit of rent is filed, the Rent 
Tribunal shall issue notice to the respondent in the form 
prescribed in the Schedule, for appearance of the 
respondent on a date not later than ten days through 
process server, registered post acknowledgement due and 
courier service. 
(2) A notice under sub-section (1) shall be accompanied 
by copies of the application and the documents annexed 
with the application. 
(3) If the respondent fails to appear and the Rent Tribunal 
is satisfied that: - 

3 
W.P.No.75857 of 2022 
 (a) 
the notice has not been served on the respondent 
or the respondent is willfully avoiding the 
service of the notice, the Rent Tribunal may 
direct service of the notice by: 
 
(i) 
 affixing a copy of the notice at some 
conspicuous part of the rented premises or 
residence of the respondent; or  
(ii) 
 Publication in the press, electronic media or 
any other mode; and 
 (b) 
the notice has been served, the Rent Tribunal 
may proceed ex-parte and pass the final order. 
 
(4) If an ex-parte order is passed against a respondent, 
the respondent may, within ten days from the date of 
knowledge, apply to the Rent Tribunal for setting aside the 
ex-parte order alongwith an application for leave to 
contest. 
(5)  If the respondent shows a sufficient cause for his non-
appearance, the Rent Tribunal may set aside the ex-parte 
order on such terms as it may fit. 
(6)  The parties may appear in person or through a 
recognized agent in the Rent Tribunal. 
(7)     If on a date fixed, the applicant fails to appear, the 
Rent Tribunal may dismiss the application. 
(8)    If an application has been dismissed in default of the 
appearance of an applicant and an application for 
restoration of the same is made within thirty days of the 
dismissal order, the Rent Tribunal may restore the 
application on such terms as it may deems appropriate. 
 
7. 
From perusal of the provisions of Section 21 of the Act, 
it is abundantly clear that the same manifestly regulate the 
procedure qua appearance of parties and consequences of non-
appearance before the Rent Tribunal in applications under the 
Act, wherein leave to contest is required to be obtained, other 
than the application for deposit of rent. The notice for 
appearance in such proceedings is required to be issued in the 
form prescribed in the Schedule to the Act with the limitation 
that the date of appearance of the respondent to be not later 
than 10 days. In terms of sub-section (1) of Section 21 of the 
Act, service of the notice is required to be effected not only 
through the process server but also through acknowledgement 
due and courier service and all such modes of service are to be 
invoked simultaneously. In terms of sub-section (2) of section 
21 ibid, alongwith the notice, copy of the application and 

4 
W.P.No.75857 of 2022 
documents annexed therewith are required to be delivered. 
Clause (a) of sub-section (3) of Section 21 ibid stipulates 
alternative or substituted modes of service of notice through 
affixation or publication in the press or through electronic 
media to be invoked in cases of failure of the respondent to 
appear where the Rent Tribunal is satisfied that either the 
notice could not be served on the respondent or he was 
willfully avoiding service thereof. Clause (b) of sub-section (3) 
of Section of the Act empowers the Rent Tribunal to proceed 
ex-parte and pass the final order where the respondent fails to 
appear and the Rent Tribunal is satisfied that the notice has 
been served. Sub-section (4) of Section 21 of the Act provides 
a remedy to the respondent to move an application before the 
Rent Tribunal for setting aside an ex-parte order within 10 days 
from the date of his knowledge, however, such application has 
to be filed alongwith an application for leave to contest and 
sub-section (5) of Section 21 of the Act empowers the Rent 
Tribunal to set aside the ex-parte order on such terms as it may 
fit if the respondent shows a sufficient cause for his non-
appearance.  
8. 
As manifest from its preamble, the Act has been 
promulgated to regulate the relationship of landlord and tenant 
and to provide a mechanism for settlement of their disputes in 
an expeditious and cost effective manner. Section 16(4) of the 
Act confers exclusive jurisdiction over a case under the Act 
and Section 22 of the Act restricts the right of a respondent to 
defend himself in an eviction application unless he obtains 
leave to contest from the Rent Tribunal within the period of 10 
days of his date of knowledge under Section 21(4) or, as the 
case may be, within 10 days of his first appearance in the Rent 
Tribunal. However, the fundamental right embodied in Article 
10A of the Constitution guarantees that for the determination 
of his civil rights and obligations, a person is entitled to a fair 
trial and due process. It has been held by the Hon’ble Supreme 

5 
W.P.No.75857 of 2022 
Court in the case of Naveed Asghar and 2 others v. the State 
(PLD 2021 SC 600) that the principles of fair trial guaranteed 
under Article 10A are to be read as integral part of every sub-
constitutional 
legislative 
instrument 
that 
dealt 
with 
determination of civil rights and obligations of any person. 
Therefore, for the determination of civil rights and obligations 
inter se landlord and tenant under the Act, the provisions 
curtailing the right to defence must be given narrow and strict 
construction and the benefit of doubt, if any, should be 
extended to enable fair opportunity to defend. 
9. 
Undisputedly, no order for service of the notice to the 
petitioner through courier service was passed even though that 
was a requirement of law specified in sub-section (1). The 
question as to whether or not the aforementioned requirement 
of law is of mandatory in nature, requires detailed analysis of 
sub-section (1) of Section 21 of the Act. The requirement to 
serve notice by invoking three modes of service simultaneously 
under Section 21(1) of the Act has been prescribed to avoid 
unnecessary delays and service of the notice can be effected in 
a timely manner.  However, no service duly effected through 
any of the specified modes shall be rendered invalid on account 
of failure to invoke all modes of service simultaneously 
inasmuch as no such consequences have been specified in the 
said provision. This is for the reason that no consequences of 
failure have been specified in the said provision. Be that as it 
may, service upon the respondent in the prescribed form and 
manner through any of the three modes is a sine qua non for 
proceeding ex-parte against him or deny him the leave to 
contest which must be established beyond doubt. 
10. 
The requirements to issue notice in the form prescribed 
in the Schedule to the Act and deliver copy of the application 
along with annexures attached therewith have been prescribed 
to duly provide all necessary information and documents to the 
respondent in a case so that he may be able to prepare and file 

6 
W.P.No.75857 of 2022 
his leave to contest within the period of limitation prescribed as 
well as to make him aware of the consequences which may 
ensue on his failure to appear and obtain leave to contest. That 
makes the requirement of service of notice in the form 
prescribed along with copy of the application and annexures 
thereto to be mandatory as without satisfying that right of 
defence of the respondent in a case shall be in jeopardy.    
11. 
Learned counsel for respondent No.1 failed to refer to 
any document to establish that copies of the application and 
the documents annexed therewith were served on the 
petitioner along with the notice in the prescribed form, as 
mandated under sub-section (2) of Section 21 of the Act.  
Although the order dated 14.09.2022 indicates that the notice 
was issued to the petitioner through registered post 
acknowledgement due yet there is no mention in the order that 
the 
acknowledgement 
due 
was 
received 
back 
with 
endorsement of the petitioner or his refusal recorded by the 
postal authorities, which was necessary to raise presumption 
of service under Article 129 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 read 
with section 27 of the General Clauses Act, 1897.  Reliance in 
this regard is placed on the case of Mst. Bibi Fatima v. 
Muhammad Sarwar (2022 SCMR 870).  The petitioner, who 
denied service in his application duly supported by affidavit, 
cannot be presumed to have been served and the Rent 
Tribunal, without satisfying the mandatory requirement of 
law, observed that the notice had been served upon the 
petitioner and proceeded against him ex-parte for his failure to 
appear on 14.09.2022, therefore, the impugned order is 
unsustainable in law and liable to be reversed.   
12. 
For the foregoing reasons, this writ petition is allowed 
and the impugned order dated 12.11.2022 passed by the 
learned Rent Tribunal, Faisalabad is hereby set aside.  
Resultantly, application of the petitioner for setting aside ex-

7 
W.P.No.75857 of 2022 
parte proceedings is allowed and his application for the grant 
of leave to contest shall be deemed to be pending before the 
learned Tribunal for decision thereon expeditiously in 
accordance with law.  There shall be no order as to costs.
