Through 
this 
constitutional 
petition, 
Muhammad Ashraf/petitioner, who is the judgment 
debtor challenges the order dated 14.10.2024 
passed by learned executing court, whereby 
instead of returning dowry articles, he has been 
directed to pay its value, which was the alternate 
relief provided in terms of decree passed by the 
Family Court in favour of Bushra Bibi/respondent 
No.2. States that petitioner is ready to return the 
dowry articles, however, respondent No.2 is not 
receiving the same without any legal justification, 
hence, the impugned order is not sustainable.  
2.  
Perusal of the record shows that suit filed by 
the respondent No.2 for maintenance allowance, 
dower and dowry articles was partially decreed to 
the extent of dowry articles and payment of 
maintenance allowance subject to performance of 
conjugal obligations and dismissed to the extent of 
dower. As the instant dispute relates to execution 
of decree for dowry articles only, hence, the said 
portion of the decree dated 25.04.2024 is 
reproduced below:- 
“ii. The plaintiff is held entitled to get dowry 
articles according to the list attached with the 

W.P. No.15322 of 2024 
 
2 
 
plaint Exh: P2 except articles mentioned at 
serial No.16, 19 & 22 or alternate value of 
Rs.230,000/- in lieu thereof from the defendant.” 
 
3. 
Through a consent order dated 30.07.2024 
passed in the proceedings of execution of afore-
mentioned decree, the petitioner agreed to return 
the decreed dowry articles to the respondent, 
which the court permitted to be done in the 
presence of Bailiff/Commission. On the next date 
of hearing fixed on 14.10.2024, the Bailiff 
submitted his report to the effect that the 
respondent claims that the articles being returned 
by the petitioner do not belong to her whereupon 
the impugned order directing the petitioner to pay 
alternate price of the dowry articles has been 
passed in the following terms:- 
“Today, the case is fixed for awaiting report of 
bailiff regarding delivery of dowry articles. 
Report has been perused. Decree Holder stated 
that the items which were shown to her do not 
belong to her and she refused to take these 
articles as per report annexed with the report of 
bailiff. 
Perusal 
of 
record 
reveals 
that 
plaintiff/decree holder is insisting that the dowry 
articles shown to her do not belong to her. 
Learned counsel for the judgment debtor stated 
that the dowry articles which are in possession 
of judgment debtor, he is ready to deliver the 
same but decree holder has refused to take the 
same. Perusal of judgment reveals that in case of 
failure to return dowry articles alternate value 
has been mentioned by the learned trial court. 
Therefore, in order to resolve the dispute 
regarding dowry articles judgment debtor is 
directed to pay alternate amount of dowry 
articles Rs.230,000/-. Learned counsel for the 
judgment debtor requested for an adjournment 
and stated that within one month, they will pay 
the alternate amount of dowry articles. In the 
interest of justice adjournment is granted. Now 
to come up for payment of decretal amount for 
16.11.2024. In case of failure to deposit above 
said amount, coercive measure will be initiated 
against the judgment debtor.” 
 

W.P. No.15322 of 2024

 4. 
The petitioner challenges the said order and 
claims that the said order is against the facts of the 
case and law on the subject and is not sustainable 
as the articles available with him are the same for 
which the decree had been passed by the Family 
Court and the respondent has refused to receive the 
said articles just to blackmail and harass the 
petitioner without any legal justification. He also 
claims that the petitioner had not agreed before the 
executing court to pay the value of dowry articles, 
which observation in the impugned order is 
incorrect.  
5. 
The perusal of the impugned order shows 
that there is dispute as to whether the articles 
sought to be returned by the petitioner belong to 
the respondent or not for which decree was passed 
and the other disputed fact is that whether the 
petitioner had agreed before the court to pay 
alternate price as mentioned in the impugned 
order, which aspect of the matter requires deeper 
appreciation of disputed facts for its determination, 
which 
is 
not 
permissible 
in 
constitutional 
jurisdiction of this Court. 
6. 
It is pertinent to mention here that in terms of 
principles of law laid down in judgments reported 
as “Rahim Bukhsh versus Mst. Shehzadi and 
others” (2018 CLC 1789 (Lahore), “Jabran 
Mustafa versus Judge Family Court and others” 
(2021 MLD 847 (Lahore) and “Abid Hussain 
versus Additional District Judge, Alipur, District 
Muzaffargarh and another” (2006 SCMR 100) the 
impugned order passed by the executing court is an 
appealable order as the same is tantamount to a 
‘decision given’ in terms of Section 14 of The 
Family Court Act, 1964 whereby the learned 
executing court has decided that the petitioner 

W.P. No.15322 of 2024 
 
4 
 
instead of returning the decreed dowry articles is 
liable to pay the value of said articles in terms of 
decree passed in alternate by the learned Family 
Court to which extent the aforementioned aspect of 
the matter has been finally decided as in terms of 
the said order the petitioner has been restrained 
from returning the dowry articles for satisfaction 
of the decree to absolve him from future liability 
and he has been burdened with duty to pay the 
value of said articles, hence, the same cannot be 
treated as an interim or interlocutory order against 
which appeal is not maintainable in view of 
Section 14(3) of the Family Court Act, 1964 
therefore, the same is appealable before the 
appellate court, which alternate remedy has not yet 
been availed. 
7. 
Consequently, this petition, at this stage is 
pre-mature due to availability of alternate remedy 
and is disposed of accordingly with observation 
that the petitioner, if advised, in the first instance 
may avail the said remedy.
