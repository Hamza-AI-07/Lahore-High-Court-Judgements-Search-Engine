Anwaar Hussain, J. This Civil Revision, under Section 115 of 
the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (“CPC”) is directed against 
judgments and decrees dated 13.10.2020 and 08.02.2022. Through 
the former judgment and decree, passed by the Civil Judge, Jhelum, 
the suit of the respondent, based on an oral agreement to sell dated 
02.06.2007, was decreed and through the latter judgment, passed by 
the Additional District Judge, Jhelum, former judgment has been 
upheld.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that neither the 
alleged oral sale transaction was perfectly pleaded in accordance with 
law nor proved, but both the Courts below while misreading the 
evidentiary resume of the case, passed the decree in favour of the 
respondent–plaintiff, which is not sustainable in the eye of law. To 
support his contention, learned counsel for the petitioner has placed 
reliance on case reported as “Muhammad Nawaz through L.Rs. v Haji 
Muhammad Baran Khan through LRs and others” (2013 SCMR 
1300). Adds that the respondent herself never appeared as witness 
and her husband, who is advocate by profession, appeared as PW-1,

which was not permissible as held in case reported as “Faridullah 
Khan v Masood Asghar Mian” (2017 CLC 1736) and therefore, his 
statement has no evidentiary value in the eye of law. Further 
contends that there was no independent witness of the purported oral 
transaction inasmuch as PW-2 is real son of the respondent whereas 
PW-3 was her domestic servant, hence, their statements cannot be 
relied upon as held in case reported as “Ameer and another v 
Mohabbata and another” (2006 SCMR 690). Further contends that 
the plaint was amended by filing an application under Order VI Rule 
17, CPC, and the entire description of the disputed property was 
changed i.e., from land measuring 05-Kanals comprising of Khasra 
No.3287 to land measuring 05-Kanals 09-Marlas comprising of 
Khasra Nos.2565 and 2566, which was not permissible; and that the 
suit was instituted after lapse of more than 12 years from the date of 
alleged oral agreement and these aspects of the case have not been 
appreciated by the Courts below. 
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent has supported 
the impugned findings with the averments that the application under 
Order VI Rule 17, CPC, was accepted with the consent of learned 
counsel for the petitioner who conducted the trial and therefore, 
challenge to this aspect of the matter cannot be taken at this stage of 
the proceedings. Adds that in terms of Order III Rule 1, CPC, a 
lawyer who happens to be the spouse of a litigant can always appear 
as special attorney/witness and there is no embargo in this regard, 
under the law. Further contends that the petitioner appeared as DW-1 
and acknowledged that he never filed a complaint when he noted the 
raising of construction upon the disputed property, in the form of 
four-wall and installation of the tube-well, which clearly exhibits that 
the respondent is in possession of the suit property, with the consent 
of the petitioner.

Arguments heard. Record perused.  

 
 
C.R. No.241-D/2022

5. 
The nub of the matter is to examine whether the respondent 
was able to prove the execution of the oral agreement to sell in her 
favour.  
6. 
It is settled principle of law that the parties can execute a 
lawful contract, orally or in writing, and such oral agreements are 
enforceable, provided legal requirements are fulfilled as envisaged 
under Section 2(b) read with Section 10 of the Contract Act, 1872 
(“the Act, 1872”), which contemplate that all the agreements are 
valid and enforceable if entered into by parties who are competent to 
contract i.e., having age of majority and of sound mind in terms of 
Section 11 and 12 of the Act, 1872, for lawful object and 
consideration and is not expressly declared as void. However, suffice 
to observe that the oral agreements are more prone to the dishonest 
improvements by the parties in the evidence and/or pleadings in order 
to succeed and for this purpose, it is obligatory on part of the party 
claiming existence of the oral agreement to clearly specify the date, 
time, place and names of the witnesses in their pleadings to 
substantiate when, how and in whose presence, the oral agreement 
was concluded as held in case reported as “Muhammad Riaz and 
others v. Mst. Badshah Begum and others” (2021 SCMR 605). 
Hence, the onus to prove is on the party who is beneficiary of the oral 
agreement.  
7. 
In present case, the respondent, who is admittedly sister-in-law 
and paternal cousin of the petitioner, averred as under:  
"2۔ ہی ہک دمہیع اور دماع ہیلع

(Emphasis supplied) 

 
 
C.R. No.241-D/2022

Perusal of above quoted paragraphs of the plaint of the suit of the 
respondent indicates that the date, time and names of witnesses are 
mentioned, however, exact place and time of the negotiations, which 
led to the conclusion of the oral agreement, is missing in the plaint. A 
vague reference to Mouza Darapur has been made, as place of the 
transaction, without clarifying as to whether it was the disputed 
property itself or someplace elsewhere, at Mouza Darapur, where the 
negotiations took place and the agreement was concluded. This 
aspect of the case involving performance of the oral agreement is 
crucial. Moreso when the respondent–plaintiff opted not to appear as 
witness in support of her claim and only her husband, who happens 
to be a member of the legal fraternity, pleaded the case and also 
appeared as special attorney (PW-1) and while being cross examined, 
stated as under: 
"از وخد اہک ریمے رھگ ںیم وہا۔ دوعی ںیم رحتری ہن ےہ ہک وسدا اہکں وہا" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       (Emphasis supplied) 
Admittedly, the respondent resides at Civil Lines, Jehlum and not at 
Mouza Darapur whereas the place of conclusion of the oral 
agreement has been stated as Mouza Darapur in the plaint and house 
during the evidence, hence, there is glaring contradiction that brings 
the case of the respondent under the clutches of the maxim “Allegans 
Contraria Non Est Audiendus” (A person who alleges things 
contradictory to each other is not to be heard), disentitling the 
respondent to any relief and the said aspect of the matter has been 
completely ignored by the Courts below. The said glaring 
contradiction regarding the place of conclusion of oral agreement is 
more obvious when the statement of PW-3, namely, Mazhar Iqbal, is 
perused, who happens to be the employee of the respondent–plaintiff. 
PW-3, stated as under: 
 "دمہیع ےک ڈریہ رپ وہا اھت۔۔۔ ۔۔۔۔۔ہی اعمدہہ داراوپر ںیم" 
(Emphasis supplied) 

 
 
C.R. No.241-D/2022

8. 
Moreover, none of the witness stated that the special attorney 
of the respondent (her husband) was present at the time of conclusion 
of the oral agreement and he took the possession and therefore, to this 
extent an improvement was made by PW-3, which has been also 
ignored by the Courts below. PW-3 stated as under: 
"

"وموجد اھت اور ولگ یھب وموجد ےھت۔۔۔۔ 
(Emphasis supplied) 
At this juncture, it is imperative to observe that the Special Power of 
Attorney by the respondent in favour of her husband was executed on 
05.05.2020 i.e., 13 years after the conclusion of the purported oral 
agreement. Meaning thereby that the purported taking over of the 
possession by the husband of the respondent as special attorney of 
the respondent, pursuant to the oral agreement is improvement if not 
a concocted story. It is imperative to mention that in case of specific 
performance of the oral agreements, improvements beyond pleadings 
are to be discarded as held in case reported as “Moiz Abbas v. Mrs. 
Latifa and others” (2019 SCMR 74). The Supreme Court of Pakistan 
held as under:  
“8.  
…… We are not impressed by this argument. 
These improvements are clearly beyond the pleadings 
and constitute and attempt to improve the case of the 
Respondents as an afterthought. Such course of action 
is not permitted by law. These requirements are sine qua 
non to prove an oral agreement to sell which have been 
settled by this Court in numerous judgments time and 
again. These are clearly missing in this case. Suits 
involving sales based on oral agreements are more 
susceptible to improvements made by parties in the 
evidence and pleadings in order to succeed. It is 
imperative that all of these requirements spelt out by 
Courts with a view that only bona fide oral agreements 
lead to grant of decrees, need to be strictly enforced and 
Courts must insist that these be fulfilled at the earliest 

 
 
C.R. No.241-D/2022 
6 
 
 
 
so as to ensure that an oral agreement is fully proved 
and the device of oral agreement is not abused by 
unscrupulous and devious litigants to get decrees by 
fraud, deceit, skillfully made improvements at different 
stages the trial.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
9. 
The above analysis propels to examine the consequences of 
non-appearance of the respondent–plaintiff as witness. In civil 
dispute conduct of the parties is of significant importance. There is 
no cavil to the preposition that Order III, Rules 1 and 2, CPC 
empower the holder of power of attorney to “act” on behalf of the 
principal. Order III, Rules, 1 & 2, CPC read as under: 
“ORDER 
III 
RECOGNIZED 
AGENTS 
AND 
PLEADERS  
1. Appearances, etc. may be in person, by recognized 
agent or by pleader. – Any appearance, application or 
act in or to any Court, required or authorized by law to be 
made or done by a party in such Court, may, except 
where otherwise expressly provided by any law for the 
time being in force, be made or done by the party in 
person, or by his recognized agent, or by a pleader 
appearing, applying or acting, as the case may be, on his 
behalf:  
Provided that any such appearance shall, if the Court so 
directs, be made by the party in person.  
2. Recognized agents. –The recognized agent of parties 
by whom such appearances, applications and acts may be 
made or done are-  
(a) persons holding powers-of-attorney, authorizing them 
to make and do such appearance, applications and acts on 
behalf of such parties;  
(b) persons carrying on trade or business for and in the 
names of parties not resident within the local limits of the 
jurisdiction of the Court within which limits the 
appearance, application or act is made or done, in matters 
connected with such trade or business only where no 
other agent is expressly authorized to make and do such 
appearances, applications and acts.” 
This Court is of the view that the word “acts” employed in Order III, 
Rules 1 and 2, CPC, confines only in respect of “acts” done by the 

 
 
C.R. No.241-D/2022 
7 
 
 
 
attorney in exercise of power granted by the instrument and would 
not include deposing in place and instead of the principal i.e., the 
respondent in the present case. In other words, if the attorney has 
performed some “acts” in pursuance to power of attorney, he may 
depose for the principal in respect of such acts, but he cannot depose 
for the principal for the acts done by the principal and not by him. An 
attorney-holder who has signed the plaint and instituted the suit, but 
has no personal knowledge of the transaction can only give formal 
evidence about the validity of the power of attorney and the filing of 
the suit and only if the attorney-holder has done any act or handled 
any transactions, in pursuance of the power of attorney granted by the 
principal, he may be examined as a witness to prove those acts or 
transactions. Similarly, if the attorney alone has personal knowledge 
of such acts and transactions and not the principal, the attorney shall 
be examined, if those acts and transactions have to be proved but the 
attorney cannot depose or give evidence in place of his principal for 
the acts done by the principal or transactions or dealings of the 
principal, of which principal alone has personal knowledge and the 
attorney was not associated with the same. 
10.  
Having above legal position in sight, it will be imperative to 
point out that the plaint of the respondent’s suit is clear. She has not 
stated that her husband (special attorney who appeared as PW-1) was 
present at the time when statedly the petitioner asked for money 
and/or on 02.06.2007, when the oral sale transaction was concluded 
or possession was taken. In this manner, it was the respondent herself 
that was the best evidence of the terms and conditions of the 
agreement, but she opted not to appear, which was withheld and 
knowledge of the attorney cannot be taken as knowledge of the 
principal more particularly, when the said attorney, was not present at 
the time of the conclusion of oral agreement. Similarly, the attorney 
cannot depose for the principal in respect of the matter of which the 

 
 
C.R. No.241-D/2022 
8 
 
 
 
principal has personal knowledge and in respect of which the 
principal is required to be cross-examined. Where a party to the suit 
does not appear in the witness box and states his own case on oath 
and does not offer himself to be cross-examined by the other side, a 
presumption would arise that the case set up by him is not correct. 
The respondent set up a defence that the petitioner approached her for 
money and the suit property was sold to her by the petitioner without 
any involvement of the special attorney. In such eventuality, it was 
necessary for her to have appeared personally, more particularly 
when she did not come with the plea of being a parda observing lady, 
which might have prevented her from appearing in the Court. The 
respondent has withheld best evidence. From her conduct, it is 
apparent that it was a ploy to grab the property of the petitioner. 
Therefore, adverse inference is to be drawn.  
11. 
Moreover, the Courts below have erred by relying upon the 
report of the local commission (CW-1) and the weakness in the 
statement of the petitioner to decree the suit of the respondent. The 
petitioner appeared as DW-1 and stated that despite having 
knowledge about the raising of some construction at the suit 
property, he did not object to the same. Insofar as the statement of the 
petitioner while being cross-examined, whereby he stated that he has 
not objected to the construction over the suit property is concerned, 
suffice to observe that it is settled principle of law that a party has to 
stand on his own legs and no benefit can be derived from the 
weakness of the opponent. Even otherwise, the said statement does 
not depict that the construction purportedly raised by the respondent 
was in furtherance of a lawfully executed oral agreement.  
12. 
The status of the construction having been raised by the 
respondent becomes more doubtful when the report of the local 
commission is examined inasmuch as the local commission was 
appointed, in hasty manner on 05.03.2020, who inspected the site on 

 
 
C.R. No.241-D/2022 
9 
 
 
 
20.03.2020, took photographs and did not submit the report. In fact,  
an application was moved by the respondent for amendment of the 
pleadings whereby the plaint was amended to the effect that the 
respondent shifted her claim to the property situated in Khasra 
Nos.2565 and 2566 comprising of 05-Kanals and 09-Marlas in toto, 
from her original claim of property situated in Khasra No. 3287 
measuring 05-Kanals and the matter remained pending till 
September, 2020, when the second visit was made by the local 
commission (CW-1) whereafter the report was submitted on 
05.09.2020. No doubt the application under Order VI, Rule 17, CPC 
filed by the respondent was not opposed by learned counsel for the 
petitioner conducting the trial, however, the contradiction regarding 
the description of the suit property creates a paradoxical situation, 
which cannot be reconciled inasmuch as if the respondent obtained 
possession and raised construction on the suit property situated in 
Khasra No.3287 measuring 05-Kanals for which she purportedly 
paid sale price to the petitioner, it appears illogical and irrational that 
the property on the spot was more than the respondent’s claim to 
have been purchased, i.e., 05-Kanals and 09-Malras and that too 
bearing different khasra numbers. Respondent side could not deny 
that the photographs appended with the report of the local 
commission were taken in March, 2020 clearly showing that the 
wheat crop was cultivated whereas no fresh photographs were taken 
when the second visit was made in September, 2020 after changing 
the description of the suit property whereafter the report was 
submitted in September, 2020.  
13. 
Moreover, the visit of the suit property by the local 
commission (CW-1) is full of doubts inasmuch as visit in March, 
2020 was followed by an application under Order VI Rule 17, CPC, 
which was readily conceded by the learned counsel appearing on 
behalf of the petitioner and then matter remained in limbo till 

 
 
C.R. No.241-D/2022 
10 
 
 
 
September 2020 for second inspection, by the local commission, 
followed by the submission of report. It is also imperative to mention 
that, on both occasions/visits, the petitioner was not present when the 
local commission visited the suit property. In this regard, local 
commission appended postal receipts with his report to substantiate 
that notices were issued to the petitioner but the latter opted not to 
appear, on both occasions/visits. Perusal of the said postal receipts 
indicates that the same were sent to the petitioner i.e., “Nasir Ali s/o 
Nasar Ullah Khan, Darapur”, whereas admittedly, in her plaint, the 
respondent gave following address of the petitioner: 
 "انرص یلع ودل رصناہلل اخن اسنک داراوپر
احل میقم ہلحم
 ریپابیغ لیصحت و علض ملہج۔" 
(Emphasis supplied)
 
 
 
 
 
 
        
 
Moreover, son of the respondent appeared as PW-2 and stated as 
under: 
"۔۔۔۔۔
درتس ےہ ہک دماعہیلع رسوگداھ اور ریپابیغ ںیم راہ شئ ذپری وہا ےہ
دارا وپر ںیم ذایت
راہشئ ہن ےہ
۔
۔۔۔۔"
 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
The above factual analysis raises serious question regarding the 
credibility of the proceedings in general and the veracity of the report 
of local commission in particular, as the local commission did not 
endeavor to effect service of the petitioner at his present (حال مقیم) 
residential address given in the plaint of the suit of the respondent, 
more particularly, when admittedly, the petitioner has no personal 
residence in Mouza Darapur. 
14. 
On the top of it is the fact that the oral agreement is stated to 
have been concluded on 02.06.2007 whereas the suit was instituted 
on 18.06.2019. The reason put forth was the close relationship 
between the parties on account of which the respondent statedly did 
not lay claim for registration of sale deed/sanction of mutation, 

 
 
C.R. No.241-D/2022 
11 
 
 
 
however, the attorney of the respondent clearly admitted that there 
had been prolonged litigation between the parties, inter alia, the suits 
for partition and pre-emption. PW-1 stated as under:  
"۔۔۔۔۔
در تس ےہ ہک دمہیع اور دماع ہیلع یک ویبی ےک امنیب ہیقب اجدیئاد یک میسقت ےک دقمامت رعہص
دنپرہ اسل ےس زری امستع ںیہ
۔۔۔۔۔"
 
Hence, the relations between the parties were not cordial. Although, 
in his written statement, no specific objection was taken by the 
petitioner that the suit of the respondent was time barred, however, 
under the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, this Court 
cannot ignore this aspect as it  belies logic that a person will deal 
with someone with whom there is pending litigation, let alone will 
pay the entire sale price and take over the possession of the property, 
under an oral agreement, but will not stress for the execution of 
proper registered sale deed and/or sanctioning of the sale mutation in 
her favour. 
15. 
Furthermore, the two marginal witnesses of the transaction are 
also not independent, which fact has been completely ignored by the 
Courts below inasmuch as PW-2, namely, Taimoor Afridi, is real son 
of the respondent, whereas PW-3, namely, Mazhar Iqbal was her 
domestic servant who, however, asserted that he was not exclusive 
employee of the respondent but was available to the inhabitants of the 
village (i.e., Rajgan Clan) as and when required for the purpose of 
some job. Meaning thereby that at the time of recording of evidence, 
he was an interested person qua his past, current and prospective 
employment with the respondent and therefore, ratio laid down in 
case of Ameer and another supra, is fully applicable to the present 
case. Loyalty of PW-3 towards the respondent gets more traction 
when following portion of his statement is read in juxtaposition with 
the statement of the local commission (CW-1): 
"۔۔۔۔
بج نشیمک ایگ وت ںیم وموجد اھت اور ولگ یھب وموجد ےھت۔
۔۔۔۔"
 

 
 
C.R. No.241-D/2022 
12 
 
 
 
Whereas local commission (CW-1) stated as under:  
"۔۔۔۔ رپت احرضی ےک العوہ یھب درگی ولگ ومعق رپ وموجد ےھت۔ ازوخد اہک ہک ومعق رپ ذنر ایحت
وموجد اھت رہظم ایحت وموجد ہن اھت
۔۔۔ ۔" 
(Emphasis supplied) 
16. 
It is settled principle of law that the civil cases are to be 
decided on the basis of preponderance of evidence. The Courts are 
obligated to overall appreciate the evidence available on record. In 
the present case, report of the local commission (CW-1) and a minor 
weakness in the petitioner’s statement have been made basis for 
rendering the impugned findings. I am of considered view that 
neither report of the local commission, which is full of irregularities, 
nor weaknesses of the defendant’s case can be made basis of passing 
a decree in suit for specific performance of contract instituted on the 
basis of an oral agreement to sell, which agreement was not 
concluded in presence of any independent witness and the record 
clearly depicts glaring contradiction in statement of PWs qua the 
execution of said oral agreement.    
17. 
 From the above discussion, it is well evident that the 
concurrent findings of the Courts below are result of grave 
misreading and non-reading of evidence and incorrect application of 
settled principles of law governing grant of decree in suit for specific 
performance of the oral agreement. Therefore, the present petition 
merits acceptance and hence, allowed. As a natural corollary, the suit 
of the respondent is dismissed.
