Through

constitutional petitions, numbered W.P. No. 29024/2024 and W.P. 
No.34713/2024, the legality-cum-enforceability of the Policy bearing 
No.2(2) NGO/Policy/2016 DATED 24th November 2022 - “Policy for 
Local NGOs/NPOs Receiving Foreign Contributions-2022”, (in short, 
the „Policy‟) is questioned on the premise that it fails to meet 

Writ Petition No. 15453/2024 
Writ Petition No. 29024/2024. 
Writ Petition No. 34713/2024.

requirements of qualifying clause; clause (a) of Article 18 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973 („the Constitution‟), 
and the Federal Government / Federal Cabinet (in short “Federal 
Cabinet” for the purposes of the lis) lacked requisite legislative 
authorization for the purposes of framing the Policy.  
2.  
Policy, manifestly, intended to regulate and enhance the 
effectiveness of foreign funding being received, availed and utilized by 
Non-Profit Organizations [in short „NPO‟] and Non-Governmental 
Organizations 
[in 
short 
„NGOs‟]. 
Petitioners 
claimed 
their 
registration/incorporation under the statutory framework, which is the 
Societies Registration Act, 1860 (Act, 1860), and pleaded that no 
restriction(s)/limitation(s) 
could 
be 
imposed 
qua 
their 
right(s)/entitlement(s) to receive and utilize foreign funds / 
contributions without the sanction of law, and especially when their 
operations, affairs and activities, including management of fiscal 
matters including foreign funding, are managed and regulated by law, 
wherein no breach is reported or alleged.  
   
Essentially the question tossed for judicial determination is,  
“Whether an act of framing and enforcing of the 
Policy by the Federal Cabinet constitutes lawful 
exercise of executive authority in the context of 

Writ Petition No. 15453/2024 
Writ Petition No. 29024/2024. 
Writ Petition No. 34713/2024. 
 
3
enumeration in clause (a) of Article 18 of the 
Constitution”.     
3.  
Profiling of the Policy is imperative to understand its scope 
and legal reach. Policy envisages introduction and enforcement of 
constraints and regulatory checks on NPOs and NGOs with respect to 
the 
receipt, 
availability 
and 
utilization 
of 
foreign 
funding/contribution(s). Not specifically expressed but, apparently it 
resonates the steps taken and efforts made to deal with the difficulties 
encountered in wake of classification of the Country in non-compliant 
category under the FATF regime. Policy provided that the authorized 
officer of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MoEA), not below the 
rank of BS-21, shall approve or reject the request of the NPOs and 
NGOs for execution of MOU with MoEA. Policy, conspicuously, has 
extended superintending role for the security agencies – whose 
designation remained unidentified. Policy spelled out that security 
agencies are required to grant clearance before signing of MOU. MOU 
is required to sign for each project and its validity is for three years, 
unless suspended or terminated. MOU is sort of permission granted to 
the entities, in receipt of foreign funding, and it envisages monitoring 
of project(s) funded through foreign funds.  
   
Report and para-wise comments were submitted on behalf of 
respondent No.1 - Federal Government.

Learned counsel submit that previously a similar attempt was 
unsuccessfully made through promulgating the policy, approved by 
Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet, for regulation of 
Organizations receiving foreign contributions vide Notification No. 
I(5)INGO/05 dated 28.11.2013, which policy was, by and large, 
identical in content and objectivity. Adds that policy stood invalidated 
through decision reported as “MARIE STOPES SOCIETYVS v. 
FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through Federal Secretary and 4 
others.” (2022 CLC 880) -, wherein, besides observing that policy was 
non-compliant in the context of the dictum laid in the case of „Messrs 
Mustafa Impex Karachi and others v. Government of Pakistan, through 
Secretary Finance, Islamabad and others” (PLD 2016 Supreme 
Court 808), the most crucial ground was absence of sanction of law 
and authority available for framing and enforcing the policy. Adds that 
likewise no sanction of law is available for extending requisite legal 
support / cover to the Policy. Learned counsel elaborates that 
petitioners are registered entities under Act, 1860 and are dealing with 
foreign funding / contributions, subject to the existing legal framework. 
Adds that mere Policy, without sanction of law, cannot be employed to 
prejudice fundamental rights extended under Article 18 of the 
Constitution. Further submits that the Policy is otherwise arbitrary, 
partial, oppressive and unique in the sense that supervisory role was 
assigned to the security agencies, which are required to grant clearance 
to the petitioners for confirming their eligibility to execute MOU. Adds 

Writ Petition No. 15453/2024 
Writ Petition No. 29024/2024. 
Writ Petition No. 34713/2024.

that exercise of authority by the Federal Cabinet, in the garb of 
assumption of powers under Rules of Business 1973, is misconceived 
and no authority could be drawn from the said Rules without the 
sanction of law. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted written 
material explaining the scope of FATF regime and details of applicable 
regulatory regime to tackle money laundering, terrorism financing, etc. 
5.  
Conversely, learned Deputy Attorney General, assisted by 
Officer of MoEA, explained that Federal Cabinet, in exercise of its 
executive authority, is competent, eligible and vested with the authority 
to frame and introduce the Policy, purpose whereof is to regulate 
foreign funding/contribution(s) received, collected and utilized by the 
NGOs / NPOs. Submits that Article 18 of the Constitution provided for 
regulating the trade / profession through a licensing system, and 
mechanism provided in the Policy for executing the MOU, is 
manifestation of prospective licensing arrangement, ought to be 
implemented. Submits that role of the security agencies is limited to the 
rendering of assistance regarding matters touching national security 
and terrorism financing issues, and absence of such-like checks would 
exacerbate difficulties for the Government in the context of FATF 
regime, which if not addressed, have had the potential of threatening 
the financial autonomy of the Country. Adds that requirements 
prescribed in Messrs Mustafa Impex (case) were met.

6.  
Heard. Report / Para-wise comments and written material 
perused. In nutshell, the argument and counter argument hinges upon 
the construction of clause (a) of Article 18 of the Constitution; context 
being the Policy. 
7.  
Jurisprudence, defining the scope and extent of fundamental 
rights acknowledged in terms of Article 18 of the Constitution, is well 
settled, which provision underpinned the concept of grant of qualified 
right(s) – envisaging imposition of “reasonable restrictions” for 
regulating the trade or profession through licensing system. It is not 
disputed that the entities, seeking indulgence against the enforceability 
of the Policy, are registered/incorporated under Act, 1860, which are 
otherwise carrying activities subject to existing / applicable legal 
framework, 
including 
matters 
dealing 
with 
foreign 
funding/contribution, and violation of any statutory direction is not 
alleged against any of the petitioners. In aforesaid context, the scope of 
subject matter determination is confined to the question that whether 
the Policy is in accord with the mandate of and fulfills the requirement 
under first proviso to Article 18 of the Constitution – [clause (a) in 
particular]. No objection regarding locus-standi of the petitioners to 
approach this Court is raised. 
8.  
Learned counsel for the petitioners emphasized that incumbent 
Policy also suffers from similar vices / deficiencies / defects, found 
fatal to the previous policy and ratio of the decision in the case of 

Writ Petition No. 15453/2024

“MARIE STOPIES SOCIETY” (supra) is fully attracted. In the context 
of the precedent cited, evidently previous policy was struck down, 
largely on two grounds. Firstly, non-adherence to the dictum laid in the 
case of „Messrs Mustafa Impex‟ (supra), and secondly, absence of 
requisite sanction of law to draft and enforce the policy. Learned 
Division Bench of Sindh High Court observed that policy itself 
acknowledged absence of requisite legal authority, and paragraph 17 
thereof is reproduced hereunder, for better comprehension, 
“17. 
In the celebrated Judgment of Messrs Mustafa Impex v. 
Government of Pakistan PLD 2016 SC 808, THE Honourable Supreme 
Court while examining different Articles of the Constituting, has 
observed that under Article 90 of the Constitution of the executive 
authority of the Federal Government. The Federal government is then 
described as consisting of fundamentally, in the opening paragraph of 
the Policy it has been incorporated that “until legislation for a 
regulatory framework for foreign economic assistance flowing outside 
government channels is enacted, for improved accounting of such flow 
of funds and greater and effectiveness the following policy will 
operate.” The word “until” used in the aforesaid paragraph of the 
policy is defined in the Black‟s Law Dictionary Sixth Edition as under:- 
“Until. Up to time of. A word of limitation, used ordinarily to 
restrict that which precedes to what immediately follows it, and 
its office is to fix some point of time or some event upon the 
arrival or occurrence of which what precedes will cease to 
exist.” 
Interestingly enough the Notification was issued in the November, 
2013 and till date no legislation for a regulatory framework for foreign 
economic assistance flowing outside governmental channels is enacted 
nor there anything on the record or submitted by the learned DAG that 
the Policy was placed before the Cabinet for decision / approval, as the 
case may be.” 
[Emphasis supplied] 
9.  
Regarding the question of sustainability of incumbent Policy, 
evidently approval of the Federal Cabinet was secured, but absence of 
sanction of law continue to haunt the Policy. Conspicuously, Policy 
contained no reference to any law, authorizing Federal Cabinet to 

Writ Petition No. 15453/2024 
Writ Petition No. 29024/2024. 
Writ Petition No. 34713/2024.

frame and introduce the Policy - there are over one dozen laws dealing 
with FATF, accessible at https://fatf.gov.pk/LawsRegulations/Laws#. 
Para-wise comments contained no reference to any law, authorizing the 
Federal Cabinet to frame the Policy. Whether, the Policy, simplicitor, 
could be employed to jettison the fundamental rights acknowledged 
through Article 18 of the Constitution. Policy, in the absence of 
sanction of law or legislative authorization, cannot be acknowledged as 
a vehicle to restrict exercise and enjoyment of qualified fundamental 
rights. Executive authority cannot be allowed to expropriate the rights 
through policy-making mechanism, unless policy is hedged by law. 
Observations recorded in paragraph 26 of the “Pakistan Muslim 
League (N) through Khawaja Muhammad Asif, M.N.A and others Vs. 
Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Ministry of Interior and 
others” (PLD 2007 Supreme Court 642) are apt for understanding the 
scope and extent of the authority of the executive, which read as,  
26. 
It may not out of place to mention here that “There is no 
inherent power in the executive, except what has been vested in it by 
law, and that the law is the source of power and duty. The structure of 
the machinery of government, and the regulation of the powers and 
duties which belong to the different parts of this structure are defined by 
the law, which also prescribes, to some extent the mode in which these 
powers are to be exercised or those duties performed. From the all 
pervading presence of law, as the sole source of governmental powers 
and duties, there follows the consequence that the existence or non-
existence of a power or duty is, a matter of law and not of fact, and so 
must be determined by reference to same enactment or reported case. 
Consequently there are no powers or duties inseparably annexed to the 
executive Government. It cannot be argued that a vague, indefinite and 

Writ Petition No. 15453/2024 
Writ Petition No. 29024/2024. 
Writ Petition No. 34713/2024. 
 
9
wide power has keen vested in the executive to invade upon the 
proprietary rights of citizens and that such invasion .cannot be 
subjected to judicial scrutiny if it is claimed that it is a mere executive 
order. This is not the position in law. Any invasion upon the rights of 
citizens by anybody no matter whether by a private individual or by a 
public official or body, must be justified with reference to some law of 
the country. Therefore, executive action would necessarily have to be 
such that it could not possibly violate a Fundamental Right. The only 
power of the executive to take action would have to be derived from law 
and the law itself would not be able to confer upon the executive any 
power to deal with a citizen or other persons in Pakistan in 
contravention of a Fundamental Right. Functionaries of State, are to 
function strictly within the sphere allotted to them and in accordance 
with law. No Court or Authority is entitled to exercise power not vested 
in it and all citizens have an inalienable right to be treated in 
accordance with law. Therefore, an action of an Authority admitted to be 
derogatory to law and Constitution, is liable to be struck down.”

Learned Division Bench of this Court in the case of “Province 
of Punjab through its Home Secretary, and 3 others Vs. Gulzar Hassan, 
Advocate and 8 others” (PLD 1978 Lahore 1298) had dilated upon the 
effect of the notifications issued through executive action, not backed 
by law – [in which case question of fundamental rights and scope of 
Article 4 of the Constitution was discussed in the light of the ratio laid 
in the case of “Ch. MANZOOR ELAHI v. FEDERATION OF 
PAKISTAN ETC. (PLD 1975 Supreme Court 66)]. It is expedient to 
reproduce paragraphs 59, 60 and 61 from the decision in case of 
“Gulzar Hassan, Advocate and 8 others” (supra), which read as,  

Writ Petition No. 15453/2024 
Writ Petition No. 29024/2024. 
Writ Petition No. 34713/2024.

59. “In view of the above observations of the Supreme Court, it is 
absolutely clear that no executive authority can take any executive 
action without the support of a valid law and any action taken in 
violation of the above rule can be struck down by the High Court under 
Article 199 of the Constitution as being without lawful authority”. 
60. As noted above Article 233(1) only refers to future legislation. The 
executive actions contemplated therein, therefore, necessarily concern 
the future legislation and not any of the void existing laws. Secondly the 
Constitution prohibits under Article 8(2) to make any legislation in 
violation of Fundamental Rights and also does not permit any 
legislation with the exception of the 6 Fundamental Rights mentioned 
under Article 233(1) it cannot be said that tie executive authorities can 
achieve the same result by purporting to take executive actions. In any 
case, observed by their Lordships of the Supreme Court in Manzoor 
Elahi's case the guarantee under Article 4 is quite separate and distinct 
from the Fundamental Rights and as no inroads have been permitted, 
even during Emergency into that provision, by any of the constitutional 
provision, the said guarantee cannot be allowed to be flouted. The 
executive authority, therefore, must rely on some valid law in order to 
support its action. 
61. The present case is placed at a better footing. The so-called 
executive action in the form of notifications had been published in this 
case on a date when no order under Article 233(2) was in the field. As 
discussed above, there was no law in operation authorising the 
respondents to have issued those notifications either. The law under 
which those two notifications were issued is admittedly inconsistent 
with the Fundamental Rights No. 17 and was void and so 
unenforceable. It, therefore, was not available for any executive action 
in the light of the discussion already made. It was never revived so as to 
be operative once again on the issuance of the Proclamation Emergency. 
The two notifications, therefore, could be scrutinized by the High Court 
and we respectfully agree with the learned Single Judge that they were 
issued without lawful authority and are of no legal effect.”

10. 
Action of the Federal Cabinet lacked sanction of law and 
legislative authorization. Unless Policy is hedged by legislative 
instrument / statutory law, it cannot be enforced to prejudice rights 
granted under constitutional mandate. Ratio of decision in the case of 
“PAKISTAN 
BROADCASTERS 
ASSOCITION 
and 
others 
v. 
PAKISTAN ELECTRONIC MEDIA REGULATORY AUTHOROITY 
and others” (PLD 2016 Supreme Court 692) is aptly attracted for the 
purposes of elucidating the proposition of law, involved. It is expedient 
to reproduce observations recorded in paragraph 16 thereof,  
“Undoubtedly no one can be deprived of his fundamental rights. Such 
rights being incapable of being divested or abridged. The legislative 
powers conferred on the State functionaries can be exercised only to 
regulate these rights through reasonable restrictions, and that too only 
as may be mandated by law and not otherwise. The authority wielding 
statutory powers conferred on it must act reasonably (emphasis supplied) 
and within the scope of the powers so conferred.  
[Emphasis added]

A seven members Bench of Hon‟ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the case of “ARSHAD MEHMOOD and others v. 
GOVERNMENT OF PUNJAB through Secretary Transport Civil 
Secretariat, Lahore and others” (PLD 2005 Supreme Court 193), 
interpreted Article 18 of the Constitution in the context of Section 69-A 
of West Pakistan Motor Vehicles Ordinance 1965, which observations, 
relevant for the purposes of present lis, are reproduced hereunder,

Para 23.  
“It is well settled that the right of trade / business or 
profession under Article 18 of the Constitution is not an absolute right 
but so long a trade or business is lawful a citizen who is eligible to 
conduct the same cannot be deprived from undertaking the same, subject 
to law which regulates it accordingly…………” 
[Emphasis supplied] 
12. 
Constitutional scheme does not envisage exercise of 
legislative powers by the Federal Cabinet, unless such power / 
authority is exercised under the authority of the legislature. An act of 
policy making, in absence of legislative authorization, manifests 
encroachment in legislative domain vis-a-vis the requirements 
prescribed under qualifying provision of law – clause (a) of Article 18 
of the Constitution. No prerogative / authority could be extended to the 
Federal Cabinet to curtail fundamental rights through executive action, 
upon framing of policy, unless such action is backed by law. 
Assumption and exercise of powers, without legislative authorization, 
for regulation of trade through licensing system in garb of clause (a) of 
Article 18 of the Constitution, constitutes patent abuse of executive 
authority and violation of constitutional scheme of trichotomy of 
powers. Policy under reference cannot be elevated to the status of law 
for obvious reasons. Federal Cabinet cannot claim concurrent powers 
with the legislature for the purposes of clause (a) of Article 18 of the 
Constitution. Federal Government, in terms of Article 7 of the 
Constitution, is one of the constituents of the State, along with the 
Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) and others. Federal Government cannot 

Writ Petition No. 15453/2024 
Writ Petition No. 29024/2024. 
Writ Petition No. 34713/2024. 
 
13
claim entitlement to make law(s), on the analogy that use of the 
expression „State‟ in clause (2) of Article 8 of the Constitution merely 
restrains the State from making law in derogation of fundamental rights, 
and otherwise entitles the State, inter alia the Federal Government to 
make law(s) in accordance with the qualifications / limitations 
prescribed without prejudicing fundamental rights under Chapter-I of 
Part-II of the Constitution. This assumption is misplaced. Power of the 
executive to legislate is subject to delegation through legislative 
authorization – often termed as subordinate legislation or delegated 
authority by the legislature. Expression “Federal law” is defined under 
Article 260 of the Constitution, which means the law made by or under 
the authority of the Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament). Policy, claiming 
force of law, can be framed by the executive provided it is made under 
the authority of Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament), but not otherwise. The 
authority of law is conspicuously missing.  Policy manifests exercise of 
colorable authority, overlooking the principle that “What cannot be 
achieved directly cannot be achieved indirectly”. Hence, the 
restrictions / limitations introduced through the Policy without the 
sanction of law are not sustainable under clause (a) of Article 18 of the 
Constitution. 
13. 
Reliance upon the Rules of Business 1973, while claiming 
authority to frame the Policy, is misplaced, which Rules do not confer 
any authority / power to frame Policy without availability of delegated 

Writ Petition No. 15453/2024 
Writ Petition No. 29024/2024. 
Writ Petition No. 34713/2024. 
 
14
legislative powers. Import of Clause (3) of Article 99 of the 
Constitution is clear and requires no interpretation, which prescribed 
that “The Federal Government shall also make rules for the allocation 
and transaction of its business”. Rules do not extend policy making 
authority without the sanction of law / legislative authorization. 
14. 
Policy and conditionalities proposed thereunder, on bare 
reading, are otherwise found unlawful and unreasonable whereby 
gatekeeper‟s role, for assessing entity‟s suitability, for the purposes of 
qualifying an entity for signing of MOU, was assigned to the security 
agencies, without identifying the description / title of the security 
agencies and explaining that under what authority of law such role 
could be assigned. [Clause 7(e) of the Policy caters for such 
requirement]. 
   
In the context of the proposition confronted, I lay my hands on 
the decision, in the case of „SHOUKAT ALI v. GOVERNMENT OF 
PAKISTAN through Secretary Interior, Ministry of Interior, Islamabad 
and 2 others‟ (PLD 2024 Islamabad 135), where learned Single Judge 
in Chambers had denied declaration of legitimacy sought qua an 
informal and unwritten practice of seeking no objection certificate from 
the Ministry of Interior, Islamabad, prior to the issuance of license 
rights by Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA), 
terming such requirement – when the parent law does not envisage 
intended discourse – as fraud on the statutory scheme. In the same vein, 

Writ Petition No. 15453/2024 
Writ Petition No. 29024/2024. 
Writ Petition No. 34713/2024. 
 
15
role proposed for the security agencies through the Policy, having no 
force 
of 
law, 
manifests 
commission 
of 
gross 
illegality, 
unreasonableness and unwarranted intrusion in the exercise of 
permissible fundamental rights. No policing powers, without the 
sanction of law [either through primary or subordinate legislation], are 
available nor could be extended to the executive for the purposes of 
restricting or denying constitutionally guaranteed rights of the 
petitioners, including right to receive and utilize foreign funding / 
contribution – [In terms of sub-clause (b) of clause (2) of Article 4 of 
the Constitution, petitioners cannot be prevented from or be hindered 
in doing that which is not prohibited by law, and in terms of sub-clause 
(c) of clause (2) of Article 4 of the Constitution, petitioners cannot be 
compelled to do that which the law does not required them to do]. And 
likewise, no leeway could be conceived or extended to the security 
agencies, to act as an instrumentality of the executive, when no 
legislative authorization was available with the executive to frame the 
Policy. In fact, allowing superintendence by the security agencies, 
without the backing of law or requisite legislative authorization, 
negates the principle and practice of constitutional / parliamentary 
democracy. Federal Cabinet is constitutionally obligated to adhere to 
the principle of supremacy of the legislature.  
15. 
Ratio settled in the case of “MARIE STOPES SOCIETY” 
(supra) – judicial findings in paragraphs 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 are fully 

Writ Petition No. 15453/2024 
Writ Petition No. 29024/2024. 
Writ Petition No. 34713/2024.

attracted. It goes without saying that notwithstanding the magnitude of 
the problem encountered, the Executive / Government has to follow the 
mandate of law, either by resorting to the options available under 
existing legal framework or approach the legislature for seeking fresh 
legislation – subject to legislative competence. 
16. 
In view of the aforesaid, the impugned Policy fails to meet the 
conditions prescribed for encumbering the qualified rights, extended in 
terms of clause (a) of Article 18 of the Constitution, hence, these 
petitions are allowed, and consequently the Policy is, hereby, declared 
unlawful, invalid and of no legal effect.
