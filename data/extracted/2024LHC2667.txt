      Muhammad Atif, etc.   Vs.  Government of Punjab, etc. 
 
J U D G M E N T 
Date of Hearing: 
17.05.2024 
Petitioner by: 
Mahar Saqib Mahmood, Advocate. 
Respondents by: 
Mr. Muhammad Saad Bin Ghazi, 
Assistant Advocate General alongwith 
Abdul 
Sattar, 
Litigation 
Officer, 
Office 
of 
C.E.O. 
Education, 
Faisalabad.  
        
 
Anwaar Hussain, J.  Briefly stated facts of the case are that the 
petitioners were admittedly employed by the School Education 
Department, Punjab on contract basis, and are no more in service, on 
account of termination of their contracts, inter alia, for the reason that 
they could not obtain the requisite qualification of B.Ed, within the 
stipulated period of time.  
2. 
By way of factual background, it has been noted that petitioner 
No.1 was appointed in accordance with the recruitment policy for the 
year 2013-2014 vide order dated 18.04.2014, and he joined the duty on 
21.04.2014, whereas, the remaining two petitioners were appointed 
under the recruitment policy for the year 2011-2012, vide order dated 
24.08.2012 and they joined the duty on 30.08.2012. The appointments 
were valid for a period of five years. In terms of the applicable policy 
for the relevant years, the petitioners were obligated to complete the 
necessary qualification (of B.Ed) within a period of three years. There 
is a distinction in the factual matrix of the case, inter se the petitioners, 
inasmuch as by virtue of notification dated 03.09.2018, petitioners 
No.2 and 3, recruited in terms of policy for the year 2011-2012, were 

2 
W.P. No.41101 of 2023 
 
 
allowed to obtain the requisite qualification till the expiry of their 
contract. Hence, the cut-of-date for obtaining requisite qualification in 
case of petitioner No.1 was 17.04.2017, whereas in case of the other 
two 
petitioners 
was 
23.08.2017. 
Petitioner 
No.1 
completed 
qualification on 18.10.2019, whereas petitioner No.2 obtained the said 
qualification on 04.10.2018 and petitioner No.3 obtained the 
qualification on 30.10.2017 and in this manner, all three petitioners 
have admittedly obtained requisite qualification after the crucial cut-of-
date. There is another important factual aspect of the matter that the 
petitioners, earlier, approached this Court through filing of independent 
constitutional petitions bearing W.P. No.69656 of 2019, W.P. 
No.21326 of 2019 and W.P. No.13151 of 2019. In said cases, 
admittedly, interim relief, to continue with the service till decision of 
those petitions, was granted to petitioners No.1 and 3 only and not 
petitioner No.2. The above-referred petitions, alongwith other similar 
matters, were taken up by this Court, and through a consolidated 
judgment dated 04.06.2021 (passed in W.P. No.13151 of 2019, titled 
“Muhammad Akmal Khan v. Government of the Punjab, etc.”), the 
same were disposed of with multiple observations/directions to the 
respondent department. The respondents were, inter alia, directed to 
review the individual cases keeping in view the observations of this 
Court, however, insofar as the cases of the petitioners who failed to 
obtain the requisite qualification, within the cut-of-date were 
concerned, order of their termination was upheld by this Court, through 
order dated 04.06.2021.   
3. 
Learned counsel for petitioners while referring to the case of one 
Hussain Farabi belonging to District Okara, states that similarly placed 
persons were allowed to complete the educational qualification beyond 
the period envisaged under the employment contract and therefore, the 
petitioners are entitled to the same relief. He has placed reliance upon 
cases reported as “Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through Secy. 

3 
W.P. No.41101 of 2023 
 
 
Agriculture and others v. Adnanullah” (2016 SCMR 1375); and “Mst. 
Ghulam Zuhra Jahangir and another v. Vice-Chancellor, University of 
the Punjab, Lahore and 8 others.” (2020 PLC (C.S.) 285). 
4. 
Conversely, learned Law Officer submits that the law/policy on 
the subject is unequivocally clear that those employees who have not 
obtained requisite qualification within stipulated period of time were 
liable to be terminated and further clarity in this regard was given by 
the Administrative Secretary, vide letter dated 03.09.2018, whereafter 
across the Province, the employees/petitioners who had not obtained 
the requisite qualification within cut-of-date, were terminated and the 
order(s) were upheld by this Court in terms of Paragraph No.5(iv) of 
the judgment dated 04.06.2021. Adds that the petitioners have not 
assailed the said order in appeal and the present petition amounts to 
seeking review of order date 04.06.2021 that is not permissible. Further 
contends that in an identical matter, similar question of law ended up 
before this Court in ICA No.58940 of 2019 titled “Muhammad Arshad 
Mahmood v. Chief Executive Officer/District Education Authority, 
Faisalabad, etc.” and a learned Division Bench has held that those 
employees who could not obtain requisite qualification of B.Ed, within 
the stipulated period of time, have no right to seek any extension in the 
said period.  
5. 
In rebuttal, learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the 
petitioners’ case falls under paragraph No.5(ii) of judgment dated 
04.06.2021 passed in case of Muhammad Akmal Khan supra, whereof 
this Court has observed that if any similarly placed Educator has been 
regularized and given relaxation, the same relief shall be extended to 
the present petitioners as well. Regarding delay in filing of the present 
petition, learned counsel for the petitioners explains that time was 
consumed to obtain copies of orders in identical matter of similarly 
placed person, Hussain Farabi referred above, therefore, the present 
petition has been filed with delay. He also referred to order dated 

4 
W.P. No.41101 of 2023 
 
 
04.10.2021 passed in case of one Syed Atta-ul- Mustafa of District 
Faisalabad whose services have also been regularized, after giving 
relaxation in time to complete the requisite qualification.  
6. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
7. 
The nub of the matter is to examine whether the petitioners who 
were admittedly required to obtain B.Ed qualification within stipulated 
period of time are entitled to be reinstated in service after having 
obtained the qualification, after the expiry of the contractual period.  
8. 
Before rendering the decision in the present case, it will be 
appropriate to browse the outcome of the earlier round of litigation 
initiated by similarly placed persons including petitioners, which ended 
up in findings dated 04.06.2021 in case of Muhammad Akmal Khan 
supra, as also decision of a learned Division Bench of this Court in 
case of Muhammad Arshad Mahmood supra. Learned Division Bench 
of this Court held as under: 
 
“Through this ICA, the Appellant has impugned 
order dated 25.4.2019 passed by the learned Single Judge 
in WP No.24738/2019. 
2. 
The facts of the case are that the Appellant was 
appointed as SESE (Math) vide order dated 17.3.2012 on 
contract basis for a period of five years. In terms of 
clause 4 of the appointment letter, the Appellant was 
required to acquire qualification of B.Ed within three 
years. However, the period was further extended up to 
five years vide letter dated 3.9.2018. The Appellant failed 
to acquire the requisite qualification within the stipulated 
period, hence his contract was terminated vide order 
dated 13.2.2019 and subsequently his representation was 
also rejected vide order dated 2.4.2019. Feeling 
aggrieved, the Appellant filed WP No.24738/2019 which 
was dismissed in limine vide impugned order dated 
25.4.2019. Hence this appeal. 
3. 
The basic grievance of the Appellant is that his 
contract was terminated without issuance of notice and 
without affording him an opportunity of hearing. 

5 
W.P. No.41101 of 2023 
 
 
4. 
After hearing the learned counsel for the Appellant 
we find no illegality with the impugned order as the 
learned Single Judge has rightly found that the Appellant 
being a contractual employee has no vested right. It has 
been held in the case titled “Federation of Pakistan, 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Karachi Vs Ali 
Ahmed Qureshi” (2001 SCMR 1733) that in the event of 
arbitrary dismissal or termination of a contract employee 
he is entitled to sue for damages equal to wages and 
other benefits. It has also been held in the case of 
“Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Law, Justice 
and Parliamentary Affairs Vs Muhammad Azam 
Chattha”(2013 SCMR 120) that contract employee 
cannot press for reinstatement; at the best he can claim 
damages for the unexpired period of his contract in the 
event of termination.  
5. 
Therefore in view of the settled principle, the 
learned Single Judge has rightly held that the Appellant 
has no vested right on the basis of which he was entitled 
to relief in a constitutional petition. 
6. 
Under the circumstances, the instant appeal is 
dismissed. The impugned order dated 25.4.2019 passed 
by the learned Single Judge in WP No.24748/2019 is 
maintained.” 
Whereas the petitioners’ earlier round of litigation culminating into 
judgment dated 04.06.2021, in case of Muhammad Akmal Khan supra, 
holds as under: 
“5. 
Consequently, the aforesaid Petitions are disposed 
of in the following terms:  
(i)  
The case of each Petitioner shall be examined 
independently 
by 
the 
concerned 
competent 
Authorities of the Education Department and 
decided within a period of one month from the 
date of this order after hearing each Petitioner with 
respect to his respective educational qualification 
in the light of observations made in this Order. 
(ii)  
Each Petitioner shall be treated at par with 
similarly 
placed 
Educators 
recruited 
and 
regularized under the Recruitment Policy, 2012 
or under the Act, as may be applicable, and 

6 
W.P. No.41101 of 2023 
 
 
accorded the same treatment as provided to such 
other Educators. Likewise, if any other relaxation 
is provided to similar placed Educators, the 
Petitioners shall also be entitled to benefit from 
the same. 
(iii)   The Petitioners, whose cases are decided in their 
favour would stand reinstated and regularized in 
the similar manner as other Educators have been 
regularized and the issue of back benefits, if not 
already in service, shall be decided by the 
competent authority in each case independently in 
accordance with law. 
(iv)  Those Petitioners who have not qualified the 
requisite educational qualification within time 
shall be deemed to have been terminated with 
effect from the date of their earlier termination as 
in the case of other Educators after the decision 
as aforesaid.  
(v)  
To give effect to the directions passed above, the 
termination letters of the Petitioners are set aside 
from the date of termination till the decision as 
aforesaid with respect to respective show cause 
notice issued to each Petitioner which shall be 
deemed to be pending.  
(vi)  Office shall transmit a copy of this Order to the 
Secretary Schools, Government of the Punjab with 
the direction to transmit the same to the relevant 
authorities for implementation of this Order in the 
light of aforesaid directions. 
(vii)   W.P. No. 227042/2018 seeking extension of 
service contract and release of salaries is dismissed 
being specifically barred under Article 212 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
9. 
Perusal of the record reveals that the case of the petitioners 
clearly falls under Para 5(iv) quoted hereinabove. Their termination 

7 
W.P. No.41101 of 2023 
 
 
was admittedly upheld. They had an opportunity to immediately file an 
appeal. Admittedly, the same has not been done. At that point of time, 
the petitioners had no idea as to whether any Hussain Farabi of District 
Okara or Syed Atta-ul-Mustafa of District Faisalabad had been given 
any extension. Prima facie, the present petition has been filed to take a 
chance on the basis of principle of similarly placed persons and 
amounts to review of the judgment dated 04.06.2021.  
10. 
Learned Law Officer was confronted as to why some relaxation 
and deviation from the uniform policy (not to extend time to any 
Educator to obtain B.Ed after cut-of-date) has been made in cases of 
Hussain Farabi and Syed Atta-ul-Mustafa. On instructions of the 
departmental representative, learned Law Officer stated that an inquiry 
is underway and disciplinary proceedings have been initiated against 
the delinquents who deviated from the policy and created exceptions 
like cases of Hussain Farabi and Syed Atta-ul-Mustafa. He has also 
relied upon the judgment cited as “Vice-Chancellor Agriculture 
University, Peshawar and others v. Muhammad Shafiq and others” 
(2024 SCMR 527) to contend that the principle of similarly placed 
persons is no ground to seek any relief from this Court. Argument of 
learned Law Officer has force. In case of Muhammad Shafiq supra, the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan while dealing with the question of 
regularization, on the basis of principle of similarly placed persons, has 
held as under: 
“6.  
It is well settled that there is no vested right to seek 
regularization for employees hired on contractual 
basis unless there is any legal or statutory basis for 
the same. The process of regularization requires 
backing of any law, rules or policy. It should 
adhere to the relevant statutory provisions and 
government policies. In the absence of any of the 
same, a contractual employee cannot claim 
regularization. Applying the principles settled by 
this Court to the proposition at hand, it becomes 

8 
W.P. No.41101 of 2023 
 
 
clear that the Respondents have no automatic 
right to be regularized unless the same has 
specifically been provided for in law or policy 
which in the present case is not available. Any 
regularization without the backing of law offends 
the principles of fairness, transparency and 
meritocracy and that too at the expense of public 
exchequer. The Impugned Judgment has also erred 
in law by failing to take into account that where a 
contractual employee wishes to be regularized, he 
must demonstrate statutory basis for such a claim, 
in the absence of which, relief cannot be granted 
solely on the principle of “similarly placed 
persons”. Article 25 of the Constitution has no 
application to a claim based upon other unlawful 
acts and illegalities. It comes into operation when 
some persons are granted a benefit in accordance 
with law but others, similarly placed and in similar 
circumstances, are denied that benefit. But where a 
person gains, or is granted, a benefit illegally, 
other persons cannot plead, nor can the court 
accept such a plea, that the same benefit must be 
allowed to them also in violation of law. Thus, the 
ground of discrimination also does not stand, 
because in order to establish discrimination it is 
important to show that the earlier act was based on 
law and policy, which has not been the case here. 
Thus, with respect to the first question raised, we 
are of the view that the regularization of the 
Respondents cannot take place without the backing 
of any law, rule or policy and without an open and 
transparent process based on an objective criteria, 
as discussed above.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
11. 
The judgment in case of Muhammad Shafiq supra unequivocally 
has laid down the contours as to how the Courts are to examine the 
matter where principle of similarly placed person is agitated. If relief is 
given to one person against the applicable policy and/or law, the same 
cannot be the ground for the grant of same relief in another case. Two 

9 
W.P. No.41101 of 2023 
 
 
wrongs are not going to make one right.  This is the crux of the case of 
Muhammad Shafique supra. Similarly, the case of Adnanullah supra is 
not of any help to the petitioners inasmuch as in the said case the 
petitioners therein were project employees and the said project was 
converted to non-development side and some of the employees were 
regularized but the petitioners of the said case were not given the same 
relief and hence, the Peshawar High Court ruled in their favour and the 
judgment of Peshawar High Court was upheld by the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan. There was no violation of, or any deviation from, any 
applicable policy or law, which is apparent in the instant case as the 
petitioners could not obtain qualification in accordance with the 
applicable policy albiet few (Hussain Farabi and Syed Atta-ul-Mustafa) 
have been given undue favour. Even otherwise, the case of Hussain 
Farabi and Syed Atta-ul-Mustafa is also not of any help to the 
petitioners inasmuch as the benefit of Para-5(ii) of the judgment dated 
04.06.2021 was to be extended to such petitioners if any similarly 
placed person was regularized prior to the passing of the said judgment 
and not in negation of the said judgment. It is well evident that orders 
in favour of Hussain Farabi dated 27.09.2022 and Syed Atta-ul-
Mustafa dated 04.10.2021 were passed after the decision by this Court 
in case of Muhammad Akmal Khan supra was rendered.  
12. 
The question of similarly placed person and scope of Article 25 
of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 can also be 
examined from another angle. The requirement to complete B.Ed 
qualification was fully applicable across the Province of Punjab and 
hundreds of other employees of the Education Department who could 
not obtain the said qualification were not extended relief (by way of 
extension to complete B.Ed) and only two instances have been brought 
before this Court i.e., case of Hussain Farabi and Syed Atta-ul-Mustafa. 
This fact itself indicates that the Department is consistent across the 
Province by adhering to the applicable policy, clarified vide letter dated 

10 
W.P. No.41101 of 2023 
 
 
03.09.2018 issued with approval of the Administrative Secretary, and 
majority of such employees were not extended any relief. If doctrine of 
similarly placed person is to be applied, the petitioners should also not 
be extended any such relief as any contra decision (like in case of 
Hussain Farabi and Syed Atta-ul-Mustafa), will become a case of 
reverse discrimination qua those individuals across the Province who 
have been denied the extension and their constitutional petitions were 
dismissed by this Court and they remained unsuccessful in appeals as 
happened in case of Muhammad Arshad Mahmood supra. A learned 
Division Bench of this Court has already settled the specific issue in 
terms of judgment rendered in case of Muhammad Arshad Mehmood 
supra and this Court is obligated to follow the same. Moreover, the 
petitioners should have been vigilant and approached the higher forum 
by filing ICA against the judgment dated 04.06.2021 rendered in case 
Muhammad Akmal Khan Supra, which the petitioners failed to do.  
13. 
In view of the preceding discussion, this petition has no force, 
hence, the same is dismissed. No order as to costs.
