ABID AZIZ SHEIKH, J.  This suit has been filed 
under section 9 of the Financial Institutions (Recovery of 
Finances) Ordinance, 2001 (Ordinance), seeking recovery of 
Rs.23,49,86,002.72/- alongwith cost of the suit and cost of 
fund against the defendants by sale of mortgaged, pledged and 
hypothecated properties.  

 
 
     COS No.21/2017

2. 
Brief facts as per averments of the plaint are that 
plaintiff bank upon request of defendant No.1 sanctioned 
various finance facilities from time to time (detail mentioned 
in para 8 of plaint), which were not only disbursed but also 
availed by defendant No.1. The said finance facilities were 
secured through mortgage, hypothecation charge and pledge 
stock. The defendants No.2 to 7 also executed their personal 
guarantees. The claim of the plaintiff bank is that the said 
finance facilities were renewed from time to time and last 
renewal and sanction was on 01.01.2016 with expiry date of 
31.12.2016 but the defendants failed to repay the outstanding 
liability, hence this suit has been filed in respect of six 
outstanding finance facilities (mentioned in para 18 of the 
plaint). The defendant No.1 has been impleaded as principal 
borrower and mortgager, whereas defendants No.2 to 7 are 
impleaded as guarantors and defendants No.8 to 14 are 
proforma defendants against whom no relief has been claimed 
in suit.  
3. 
In response to the summons, contesting defendants 
No.1 to 7 entered appearance and filed their joint application 
for leave to defend the suit (PLA No.26329-B/2017) (PLA). 
Learned counsel for defendants No. 1 to 7, while arguing the 
PLA submits that defendants No.4 to 7 are impleaded in this 

 
 
     COS No.21/2017 
-3- 
 
 
 
 
suit being the guarantors for six facilities in question. Submits 
that no doubt defendants No. 2 to 7 executed their personal 
guarantees on 15.01.2013 (pages 619 to 623) but thereafter 
only defendants No.2 and 3 executed their personal guarantees 
on 19.05.2014, 13.12.2014 and 01.01.2016 in view of the offer 
letter dated 08.05.2014 (page 119), where specifically only 
defendants No.2 and 3 were required to execute the 
guarantees, hence defendants No. 4 to 7 have been discharged 
from their personal guarantees which was no more required 
after offer letter dated 08.05.2014. In respect of the pledge 
stock, he submits that the pledge stock was in custody of the 
plaintiff-Bank and therefore any shortfall in the pledge stock is 
the responsibility of the Bank and the defendants may be 
allowed the adjustment of the value of the stock. However, 
submits that this question can be decided by the Executing 
Court.  In respect of the ‘Demand Finance-1 Facility’ (DF-1), 
he submits that as per offer letter dated 08.05.2014, the expiry 
date of DF-1 is 31.03.2016 whereas the markup of Rs.1.437 
Million has been charged beyond expiry date 31.03.2016 (he 
referred to last three entries at page 682 of the suit). In respect 
of the ‘Cash Finance Pledge Facility’ (CF pledge), he submits 
that the said finance facility has been renewed on 01.01.2016 
but the said renewal is not backed by any fresh offer letter and 

 
 
     COS No.21/2017 
-4- 
 
 
 
 
the last offer letter was dated 08.05.2014. He further submits 
that in the plaint (page 19), it is shown that the debited amount 
is Rs.465 million whereas the credited amount is much more 
i.e. 545.2 million and therefore the outstanding amount of 
Rs.76 million is not justified. He submits that in any case, the 
aforesaid amount will go beyond the limit of CF pledge i.e. 
Rs.150 million mentioned in the offer letter. He submits that 
the ‘Brought Forward’ entry in the statement of account (at 
page 683) has not been explained in respect of CF pledge. At 
this stage, he also submits that the claim of the plaintiff-Bank 
that after the renewal of the finance facility, no disbursement 
was made, is not supported by record as there are number of 
disbursement entries in the statement of account including at 
page No.690 of the statement of account. He further submits 
that there are number of “transfer entries” in the statement of 
account without explaining from where the said amounts are 
debited or credited, hence this is a ground for leave to defend 
as per law settled in “Bank of Punjab Versus International 
Ceramics Ltd and others” (2013 CLD 1472) and Messrs 
DHRALA OIL MILLS through Partners/Guarantors and 4 
others Versus The Bank of Punjab through Branch Manager 
(2014 CLD 153). He submits that even various ‘Letter of 
Credit’ (LC) facilities are not backed by any documents 

 
 
     COS No.21/2017 
-5- 
 
 
 
 
including ‘Letter of Credit’ and ‘Bill of Lading’. Submits that 
defendants specifically disputed the amount of US$ 79237.06 
(page 227) paid under L.C. No.20810400923 being without 
any request letter from defendants. Submits that there is also 
no fresh offer letter for the LC facilities in 2016. He placed 
reliance on the judgment passed by the Division Bench of this 
Court 
in 
RFA 
No.335/2011 
dated 
03.05.2017 
and 
RFA.1251/2014 dated 28.01.2020. Submits that in absence of 
the LC documents, the leave to defend be granted. He finally 
submits that regarding Cash Finance (CF) (Hypothecation) 
Facility, the Brought Forward entries are without any 
explanation (pages 698 and 699) and further submits that 
amounts debited i.e. Rs.86.317 Million under said facility is 
much less than amount credited i.e. Rs.90.318 million and 
hence there is no amount outstanding against the defendants. 
4. 
Learned counsel for the plaintiff bank in response 
submits that the personal guarantees of defendants No.4 to 7 
were executed on 15.01.2013 and the said guarantees being 
continuing guarantees, they will be liable for the outstanding 
amount notwithstanding the renewal of the finance facilities 
from time to time. Regarding the pledge stock, she submits 
that as constructive possession was with the defendant No.1, 
therefore, the plaintiff bank is not responsible for shortfall in 

 
 
     COS No.21/2017 
-6- 
 
 
 
 
the pledge stock. She placed reliance on Messrs WORLD 
TRANS LOGISTICS and others vs. SILK BANK LIMITED and 
others (2016 SCMR 800). She however does not dispute that 
the markup of Rs.1.437 Million was beyond the expiry of 
finance agreement, therefore, the same may be deducted from 
the markup claimed in the suit. Submits that there is no need 
for any sanction letter for renewal of the finance facility in 
presence of finance agreement. Submits that the statement of 
account is not properly appreciated by the defendants, 
according to which Rs.76 Million is outstanding against Cash 
Finance pledge. Submits that even the ‘Brought Forward’ 
entries are admitted in the loan application form and in the 
annual audit reports, hence the said amount cannot be disputed 
here. Further submits that none of the alleged transfer entries 
are challenged in the PLA, therefore the same cannot be 
challenged during the arguments. Further submits that the 
same is the position with the CF hypothecation. Finally 
submits that entire LCs related documents are appended with 
the plaint and the amounts paid under the LCs are on the 
request of the defendant No.1. 
5. 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties and 
perused the record with their able assistance. Regarding 
personal guarantees of defendants No.4 to 7, the record shows 

 
 
     COS No.21/2017 
-7- 
 
 
 
 
that said guarantees were executed on 15.01.2013 to repay the 
amount under the agreement dated 15.01.2013 between the 
plaintiff bank and defendant No.1. However neither any such 
finance agreement dated 15.01.2013 has been appended with 
the suit nor the suit is based upon the said agreement. 
Admittedly the finance agreement regarding DF-1 and 
Demand Faclity-2 (DF-2) between the plaintiff bank and 
defendant No.1 is dated 04.02.2013 which is after the 
execution of aforesaid personal guarantees dated 15.01.2013. 
It is also admitted by the plaintiff bank that the finance 
facilities in question were renewed vide sanction letter dated 
08.05.2014, however in the said sanction letter, no fresh 
guarantees of defendants No.4 to 7 were required rather only 
personal guarantees of defendants No.2 and 3 being sponsor 
Directors of the company were sought and duly executed. It is 
also not disputed that the DF-1 and DF-2 facilities were 
renewed from time to time but no fresh guarantees were 
executed by defendants No.4 to 7. In the circumstances, the 
personal guarantees of defendants No.4 to 7 have no direct 
nexus with the outstanding liability under the finance 
agreements dated 04.02.2013 and if at all there was any 
connection, the said guarantees have been discharged under 
section 133 of the Contract Act, 1972 (Contract Act) when 

 
 
     COS No.21/2017 
-8- 
 
 
 
 
vide sanction letter dated 08.05.2014, the finance facilities 
terms were varied and renewed but no fresh guarantees were 
required from defendants No.4 to 7 and only defendants No.2 
and 3 being sponsored directors executed their personal 
guarantees. 
6. 
Once the terms of the finance through sanction letter 
dated 08.05.2014 were changed and the defendants No.4 to 7 
were not required to execute fresh personal guarantees and 
their guarantees were expressly omitted from security structure 
of finance facilities, the said defendants are discharged from 
their personal guarantees in view of law settled by this Court 
in COS No.48/2013 titled Bank of Punjab vs. Gulshan 
Spinning Mills Limited vide judgment dated 28.03.2018 where 
it is held as under:- 
 
“7. 
The perusal of the record clearly shows that 
the plaintiff bank through offer letter dated 
09.05.2012 did not require the personal guarantees of 
defendants No.2 and 4. Their guarantees were, 
therefore, expressly omitted from the security 
structure of the finance facilities. In this view of the 
matter, the plaintiff bank cannot press into service its 
claim against defendants No.2 and 4 notwithstanding 
any stipulation contained in the personal guarantees. 
Learned counsel for the plaintiff also did not seriously 
contest the defence put forward by defendants No.2 
and 4 and stated that he will not press his claim 
against the said defendants.” 
 
The same view was also expressed by this Court in RFA 
No.51/2015 titled Saudi Pak Leasing Company Limited vs. 

 
 
     COS No.21/2017 
-9- 
 
 
 
 
Adil Textile Mills Limited etc. vide judgment dated 
20.01.2020, where it is held as under:- 
 
“12. 
We are in agreement with the contention 
made in regard to the guarantee allegedly executed 
by respondent No.5. Offer letter dated 29.03.2004 
through which the lease facility was made available 
to the respondents does not reflect that respondent 
No.5 was required to submit her personal guarantee. 
Learned counsel for the appellant did not seriously 
contest the stance of the respondents and stated that 
he shall have no objection if personal liability of 
respondent No.5 is excluded from the judgment and 
decree passed by the Banking Court.” 
 
 
Reliance is placed on Naghma Arshad Toor and 2 others vs. 
Habib Bank Limited and another through sale Proprietor 
(2007 CLD 272) and Mrs. Yuba Jamil Ansari vs. Bank Al-
Falah Limited and another (2009 CLD 1177). 
7. 
Regarding claim of pledge stock, the Supreme Court 
as well as this Court repeatedly held that availability or 
otherwise of the pledge stock is a question that can be 
determined in execution proceedings at the time when 
collateral security is required to be accounted for and brought 
to the sale, therefore, it is not a ground of defence to the 
defendants for grant of leave. In this regard reliance is placed 
on Messrs Muhammad Siddiq Muhammad Umar and another 
vs. The Australasia Bank Ltd. (PLD 1966 SC 684), Habib 
Bank Limited vs. Orient Rice Mills Ltd. and others (2004 CLD 
1289), Siddique Woollen Mills and others vs. Allied Bank of 

 
 
     COS No.21/2017 
-10- 
 
 
 
 
Pakistan (2003 CLD 1033), Messrs Crystal Enterprises and 6 
others vs. Platinum Commercial Bank Limited and 2 others 
through General Attorney (2002 CLD 868), Faisal Bank 
through duly appointed Attorneys vs. Messrs Zimindara Rice 
Mills and 21 others (2007 CLD 1164) and Messrs Khalid Oil 
Mills through Sole Proprietor and 2 others vs. Muslim 
Commercial Bank Limited through Manager/Attorney (2005 
CLD 1565). The law settled by the Supreme Court in case of  
Messrs WORLD TRANS LOGISTICS and others vs. SILK 
BANK LIMITED supra regarding the status of pledge stock 
with the bank being constructive possession, can also be 
examined by the Executing Court at the relevant time.  
8. 
The claim of the defendants that markup of Rs.1.437 
Million has been charged beyond the expiry date i.e. 
31.03.2016 of the finance agreement regarding DF-1 is not 
only supported by record but also candidly conceded by 
learned counsel for the plaintiff, therefore, said amount is 
liable to be excluded from the suit amount. In this regard 
reliance is placed on I.C.P. and others vs. Messrs Chiniot 
Textile Mills Ltd. (PLD 1998 Karachi 316), Bashir Begum 
and 5 others vs. Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan 
(2005 CLD 373), National Bank of Pakistan through Zonal 
Chief vs. Messrs Saif Nadeem Electro Limited and others 

 
 
     COS No.21/2017 
-11- 
 
 
 
 
(2003 CLD 1468), Haji Fazal Elahi & Sons through 
Muhammad Tariq vs. Bank of Punjab and another (2004 CLD 
162) and Askari Commercial Bank Limited and others vs. 
Pakland Cement and others (PLD 2000 Karachi 246). 
9. 
The next argument of learned counsel for the 
defendants that the CF pledge facility is not backed by any 
sanction advice, hence not recoverable, is also misconceived. 
It is settled law that sanction advice is an internal document of 
the bank, which can be seen only to know what was approved 
by the bank, whereas Finance Agreement overrides all 
arrangements and in the agreement, vis-a-vis the Customer, the 
sanction advice cannot be construed to disadvantage the 
customer. It is also well settled that financial institution cannot 
be non-suited on the basis of mere non-production of sanction 
advice as there is no such requirement of law. In the present 
case, the CF pledge facility is backed by the finance agreement 
dated 01.01.2016 and there is no need for sanction advice, 
when the finance agreement duly executed between the parties, 
is available on record. Reliance is placed on United Bank 
Limited vs. M/s Hassan Muhammad Cotton Industries & Oil 
Mills and others (PLJ 2017 Lah. 415 (DB), Habib Bank vs. 
Messrs Qayyyum Spinning Ltd. (2001 MLD 1351), United 
Bank Ltd. Karachi vs. Messrs Gravure Packaging (Pvt.) Ltd. 

 
 
     COS No.21/2017 
-12- 
 
 
 
 
and 4 others (2001 YLR 1549) and United Bank Limited vs. 
Messrs Central Cotton Mills Ltd. and 5 others (2001 MLD 
78).  
10. 
Even otherwise under section 9 of the Ordinance, the 
suit can be filed by a financial institution when a customer 
commits default in fulfilment of any obligation. The term 
‘obligation’ under section 2(e) of the Ordinance include any 
agreement, therefore, the finance agreement itself is not only a 
sufficient document to establish default but also for filing of 
the suit. The purpose of sanction letter is only to support the 
finance agreement, if it is disputed, however placing on record 
the same is not a precondition to execute the finance 
agreement or for filing of a suit. Further the defendants have 
not denied the request letter and Board of Directors Resolution 
for the renewal of the short term finance through agreement 
dated 01.01.2016. In similar situation, in the case of Habib 
Bank Ltd vs. Taj Textile Mills Ltd. through Chief Executive 
and 5 others (2009 CLD 1143), this Court held that when the 
borrower has defaulted and requested for restructuring/renewal 
of loan which was granted by bank, plea for leave to defend 
the suit on its own force was not relevant, thus refused.  
11. 
The plea of the learned counsel for the defendants that 
‘Brought Forward’ entries are not explained, hence it is ground 

 
 
     COS No.21/2017 
-13- 
 
 
 
 
for leave to defend has also no basis. The outstanding amount 
of all six facilities is admitted in the annual audit reports of 
defendant No.1 and further ‘Brought Forward’ entries relate to 
previous outstanding liabilities to the defendants which are not 
only admitted in the loan application forms but are also 
corroborated by the statement of accounts. The defendants 
have also not disputed the execution of previous charge 
documents. In the circumstances, the defendants could not 
question the ‘Brought Forward’ entries to which they were 
beneficiary and have specifically requested for renewal of 
outstanding loans through application alongwith Board of 
Directors Resolution etc. In this regard reliance is placed on 
Haq Nawaz and another vs. Habib Bank Limited through 
Manager, PAF Branch, Peshawar and 5 others (2021 CLD 
1367).  
12. 
Regarding “transfer entries” in the statement of 
account, no doubt this Court granted leave to defend in some 
cases, where specific entries were challenged being merely 
shown as “transfer entries” but in this case admittedly the 
defendants in their PLA have not challenged the said transfer 
entries specifically. Failure on the part of defendants to dispute 
entries in the statement of account at the relevant time when 
the same were sent to the defendants by the bank, is also hit by 

 
 
     COS No.21/2017 
-14- 
 
 
 
 
principal of financial estoppel. In this regard reliance is placed 
on Messrs Naeem Zafar Industries and others vs. Bank of 
Punjab (2017 CLD 397), National Bank of Pakistan vs. 
Chenab Limited and others (2017 CLD 1539), Messrs Razzaq 
and Company v. Messrs Riazeda (Pvt.) Ltd; and 
International Finance Corporation v. Sarah Textiles Ltd. 
and 3 others (2009 CLD 761), Askari Bank Limited vs. Syed 
Zulfiqar Rizvi (2017 CLD 1298) and Allied Bank Limited vs. 
Messrs Fatima Enterprises Limited and others (2017 CLD 
1711). The Supreme Court in Mrs. Asma Hassan and another 
vs. Askari Bank Limited (2019 SCMR 1873) also held that 
when any entry in the statement of account not specifically 
challenged, then it was to be presumed that the accounts 
prepared and maintained by the bank were correct. It is also 
settled law that when the specific plea is not raised in the PLA, 
the same cannot be argued to set up a new case beyond 
pleadings. Reliance is placed on Abrar Ahmed and another vs. 
Irshad Ahmed (PLD 2014 SC 331).  
13. 
In respect of the LC facilities, claim of the defendants 
is that same are not backed by any documents and further no 
request was made by the defendants for payment of US 
$79237.06 under LC No.20810400923. In this behalf I have 
carefully examined the documents. The plaintiff bank has 

 
 
     COS No.21/2017 
-15- 
 
 
 
 
placed on record all relevant documents of LCs including 
application and agreement for irrevocable documentary credit, 
bill of exchange, letter of acceptance, trust receipts, letter to 
customer, commercial invoices, proforma invoices and bank 
statement alongwith suit. Further so far as the amount of US 
$79237.6 is concerned, no doubt the original request dated 
16.06.2015 of the defendant No.1 for opening of LC was for 
US $79237.6, however further request was made on 
24.06.2015 to enhance the amount to US $159300 under said 
LC, which also covered the disputed amount of US $79237.06, 
hence it cannot be said that the said payment was made 
without request of the defendant No.1.  
14. 
The final argument of learned counsel for the 
defendants that the credit entries mentioned in the plaint as 
well as statement of accounts, are more than the debit entries, 
hence no amount is outstanding, is also misconceived. The 
statement of account shows that debit and credit entries 
mentioned therein are from 23.05.2014, however before the 
aforesaid date, there was already outstanding brought forward 
balance of Rs.142 Million. Therefore, credit entries are not 
only to adjust the debit entries but also the outstanding 
‘Brought Forward’ balance of Rs.142 Million and after partial 

 
 
     COS No.21/2017 
-16- 
 
 
 
 
adjustment, outstanding amount was Rs.76 Million against CF 
(Pledge) was correctly claimed in the suit. 
15. 
In view of above discussion, subject to deletion of 
amount of excess markup of Rs.1.437 Million, recovered after 
the expiry of finance agreement, the plaintiff claim in the suit 
is substantiated by agreements, statement of accounts as well 
as charge documents against defendants No.1, 2 and 3 and said 
defendants have not been able to raise any substantial question 
of law or fact requiring recording of evidence for its 
resolution. However the plaintiff bank could not establish its 
claim against defendants No.4 to 7 being guarantors as 
discussed in preceding paras of this judgment. Consequently 
the PLA is dismissed and the suit of the plaintiff bank is 
decreed in favour of the plaintiff bank and against defendants 
No.1 
to 
3 
jointly 
and 
severally 
for 
amount 
of 
Rs.23,35,49,002.72/-together with cost and cost of fund as 
contemplated by section 3 of the Ordinance and will be 
recoverable by sale of mortgaged, pledged and hypothecated 
properties. Decree sheet be prepared accordingly.  
16. 
Defendants No.8 to 14 are proforma defendants and 
no relief has been claimed against them, hence their PLAs 
No.28951/2017, 30837/2017, 30979/2017, 151992/2018 and 
5126/2019 are disposed of accordingly. 

 
 
     COS No.21/2017 
-17- 
 
 
 
 
17. 
The decree is now converted into execution 
proceedings under section 19 of the Ordinance. The decree 
holder will submit Fard Taleeqa/list of mortgaged, pledged and 
hypothecated properties of the judgment debtors forthwith.
