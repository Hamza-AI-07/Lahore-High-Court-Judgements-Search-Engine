    Anwaar Hussain, J.  Though this single judgment, the 
present as well as connected constitutional petitions, bearing W.P. 
No.2291 of 2024, W.P. No.2445 of 2024 and W.P. No.2446 of 2024, 
are being simultaneously decided for the reasons that the dispute 
relates to the rented premises, which is a joint property that belongs 
to present respondent No.1, namely, Ashfaq Hussain Minhas, who is 
petitioner in connected petition No.2445 of 2024 (“hereinafter 
referred to as “the landlord”) and Mst. Azra Begum (“hereinafter 
referred to as “the landlady”) who is petitioner in connected 
petition No.2446 of 2024 and respondent No.1 in connected petition 
No.2291 of 2024 and is in occupation of the present petitioner, 
namely, Muhammad Saleem Minhas (hereinafter referred to as “the 
tenant”).

2. 
      By way of factual background, it is noted that the tenant as 
well as Ms. Saiqa Afzaal/respondent No.2 in present petition, were 
inducted as the tenants through separate tenancy agreements (by the 
landlord and landlady) and collectively the monthly rent was fixed 
as Rs.130,000/- (Rs. 65,000/- per month through each tenancy 
agreement). The rented premises is three storey building along with 
three shops and Haveli with seven shops therein situated at Naya 
G.T Road Sarai Alamgir. These facts are admitted. It is also 
admitted feature of the case that the ejectment petitions were filed by 
the landlord and the landlady on the ground of default, and first 
round of litigation ended up before this Court in constitutional 
petitions bearing W.P. No.5873 of 2022 and W.P. No.5866 of 2022, 
and during the course of said proceedings, the tenant undertook that 
he is solely responsible for the tenancy with the landlord and the 
landlady for the purpose of rent, any default thereof and the 
litigation pertaining thereto. The said constitutional petitions were 
disposed of by this Court, with the consent of the parties, vide order 
dated 23.06.2022. Leave to appear and contest was granted to the 
tenant and the matter was remanded to the Special Judge (Rent), for 
decision afresh. It is imperative to observe that during the 
proceedings before this Court in earlier round of litigation, the tenant 
undertook to clear the amount of rent due as on the said date i.e., 
23.06.2022. On remand, issues were framed and evidence was led 
and recorded whereafter the Special Judge (Rent), through separate 
order(s) of even date i.e., 01.03.2024 accepted the ejectment 
petitions and passed order of eviction, however, the claim for arrears 
of rent was dismissed and when separate appeals were preferred by 
both sides, the order of the Special Judge (Rent) was maintained and 
the appeals were dismissed, vide impugned judgments of even date 
i.e., 15.07.2024. 

3 
W.P. No.2292 of 2024 
 
 
3. 
     The tenant has assailed the impugned order(s) on the 
ground that once the Special Judge (Rent) reached the conclusion 
that no arrears were payable as the tenant had cleared the entire 
amount of arrears after the order of this Court dated 23.06.2022 was 
passed, in the earlier round of litigation bearing W.P. Nos.5873 of 
2022 and 5866 of 2022, no ground for acceptance of the eviction 
petition stood out. 
4. 
      Conversely, learned counsel for the landlord/landlady 
submits that the tenant was defaulter from day one as he never paid 
the agreed amount (Rs.130,000/-), in accordance with the terms of 
the tenancy agreements. Adds that the parties agreed that the rent 
will be enhanced @ 10% every year after January, 2021, which 
enhanced amount was also not paid and therefore, the connected 
petitions merit acceptance and the landlord and landlady are entitled 
to the arrears of rent on account of the increase. Further contends 
that even if it is found that the landlord and landlady are not entitled 
to the arrears, they will be satisfied if the vacant possession of the 
rented premises is handed over to them as the tenancy agreement(s) 
have expired, during the pendency of the ejectment proceedings.  
5. 
      In rebuttal, learned counsel for the tenant submits that 
expiry of tenancy was not taken as a ground of eviction and since 
there is no default in payment of rent, therefore, the impugned orders 
passed by the fora below are not sustainable and the expiry cannot 
be made basis of the eviction, by this Court. Adds that even if the 
petitioner paid lessor amount of rent, on few occasions, the 
petitioner also paid amount in excess of the monthly rent i.e., 
Rs.130,000/- as evident from the bank statement of the landlord, 
which was not objected to by the landlord.  
6. 
    Arguments heard. Record perused.  

4 
W.P. No.2292 of 2024 
 
 
7. 
    The legal question which requires determination by this 
Court is articulated as under:  
“Whether an order of eviction can be passed on 
ground of expiry of the tenancy period/lease when 
the said ground is not taken and the eviction 
petitions are only filed on the basis of default?   
8. 
      Before addressing the above referred legal question, it will 
be appropriate to analyse the factual matrix of the case. It is admitted 
feature of the case that the tenant was inducted on the basis of 
written tenancy agreement(s) dated 29.07.2019 and 31.07.2019 
executed by the landlord and the landlady respectively, in favour of 
the tenant, for a period of five years. The eviction petitions were 
filed on account of personal need and default and when the matter 
ended up before this Court in the earlier round of litigation, 
following order dated 23.06.2022 was passed with consent of the 
parties: 
“5. 
Conversely, it is the case of the 
respondent that the petitioner has committed 
willful default in payment of rent in terms of the 
tenancy agreement in field and at present, an 
amount of Rs.16,64,800/- including rent for the 
month of June, 2022 is outstanding against him. 
However, after arguments at some length, the 
parties have reached the consensus that the 
respondents/landlords have no objection if the 
present petition is allowed and the applications for 
leave to appear and contest the ejectment petitions 
filed by the petitioner are granted provided the 
petitioner deposits an amount of Rs.16,64,800/- in 
the 
above 
referred 
joint 
account 
of 
the 
respondents within stipulated timeframe. The 
parties have reached the consensus in the 
following terms:  
(i) 
The petitioner will deposit an amount of 
Rs.16,64,000/- in the joint bank account of 
the respondents/landlords within a period of 
one month from today which will be subject 

5 
W.P. No.2292 of 2024 
 
 
to adjustment at the time of final decision; 
and 
(ii) The petitioner will continue to pay regular 
monthly rent alongwith statutory increase in 
terms of the tenancy agreement.  
6. In view of the above consensus, this writ 
petition is allowed and the impugned order and 
judgment passed by learned courts below are set 
aside. Resultantly, the ejectment petitions filed by 
the respondents/landlords will be deemed to be 
pending in which applications of the petitioner for 
leave to appear and contest are allowed subject to 
fulfillment of above referred condition of deposit 
of Rs.16,64,800/- in the joint bank account of the 
respondents/landlords within stipulated time. It is 
clarified that in case the petitioner fails to deposit 
the above said amount within the prescribed time, 
this order shall cease to have any legal effect and 
the present petition alongwith the connected writ 
petition will be deemed to be dismissed.  
7. Since this is a rent matter, the learned Special 
Judge (Rent) will conclude the proceedings 
expeditiously, preferably within three months 
commencing from the date of receipt of certified 
copy of this order, strictly in accordance with 
law.”  
The above quoted order dated 23.06.2022 is unequivocal. It is 
misconceived on part of the tenant that once the matter was 
remanded by this Court to the Special Judge (Rent) and the amount 
of arrears of rent was deposited, question of default came to an end. 
The application for leave to contest filed by the tenant was allowed 
and the matter was remanded for decision afresh including the issue 
of default after recording of evidence by passing a final order. 
Similarly, it is utterly misconceived and misconstrued on the part of 
the tenant to contend that since no arrears of rent were awarded, 
therefore, no case of default was made as it is acknowledged by 
learned counsel for the tenant that the monthly rent of Rs.130,000/- 

6 
W.P. No.2292 of 2024 
 
 
was never paid in accordance with the provisions of the tenancy 
agreements and often short payments were made. Delay in payment 
has also not been denied. However, it has been averred that by 
accepting the short and/or delayed payment, the landlord and/or the 
landlady ratified the default and/or the delay in payment of the rent. 
The said argument is also misconceived. The fora below have only 
declined the arrears of rent prior to the institution of the petition 
because the entire default was cleared when the proceedings ended 
up before this Court. The record as also the acknowledgment on part 
of the tenant that there were short and delayed payments in monthly 
rent, which makes the tenant defaulter and liable to be evicted. In 
this regard, operative part of the judgments of even date rendered by 
the Appellate Court below is worth reproducing:

9. 
Adverting to the claim of the landlord/landlady qua arrears of 
the rent, it has been noted that though there is nothing on record to 
substantiate that the tenant was paying the amount due, after 
incorporating/calculating 
necessary 
agreed 
annual 
increase, 
however, learned counsel for the landlord/landlady, on instructions, 
has submitted that in case the order of eviction is implemented, they 
would  not press their claim, in respect of arrears of the rent, through 
the connected petitions bearing No. 2445 of 2024 and 2446 of 2024. 
Even otherwise, the landlord/landlady have not given any detail 
about the actual amount of default (arrears) qua the annual increase, 
which fact persuaded the Appellate Court below to pass the 
following order:

The findings of the Appellate Court below are apt.  
10. 
The above discussion takes this Court to the nub of the matter 
as to whether an ejectment order, on the basis of expiry of tenancy 
period/lease can be passed, when the same is not the ground taken in 
the eviction petition. In this regard, it is imperative to note that the 
Punjab Rented Premises Act, 2009 (“the Act”) aims to consolidate 
the law relating to the relationship of landlord and tenant, inter alia, 
as to how the tenant is to be inducted in the rented premises and the 
eviction thereof can be obtained. The object of the Act is to regulate 
the tenancy relationship between the landlord and the tenants and 
simultaneously protect the tenants from unjustified and unlawful 
eviction as well as the rights of the landlord by ensuring eviction in 
case of default of the tenant from his contractual and statutory 
obligations. The Act envisaged grounds of eviction in terms of 
Section 15 thereof. Expiry of the term of tenancy is a valid ground 
for eviction in terms of clause (a) of Section 15 of the Act, however, 
admittedly, the same was not taken as a ground for eviction when 
the ejectment petitions were filed for the obvious reason that at the 
relevant point of time, the tenancy period was not expired. 
Admittedly, the tenancy period expired during the pendency of the 
eviction petitions. This Court is of the opinion that in principle, 
ejectment order can only be passed on the ground(s) taken in the 
eviction petition. However, in cases where the eviction is sought on 
grounds other than expiry and said other ground(s) are not proved 
but the period of tenancy expires during the pendency of eviction 

8 
W.P. No.2292 of 2024 
 
 
proceedings, before the Special Judge (Rent), or in appeal, or before 
this Court, question arises as to whether in such circumstances, the 
ejectment petitioners be asked to withdraw the ejectment petitions 
and file amended or fresh petition by adding/taking expiry of the 
tenancy as additional or fresh ground of eviction. In this regard, it is 
settled principle of law that once a tenant is always a tenant, nothing 
but a tenant. Directing the eviction petitioners to file a fresh eviction 
petition (with expiry of tenancy as a ground of eviction) would 
amount to lingering on the matter in a manner that the tenant is 
enabled to continue with the occupation of the rented premises, 
without consent of the landlord, for no beneficial outcome except 
that after fulfilling codal formalities of issuing notice on such fresh 
eviction petition, the same merits acceptance. Additionally, such 
fresh petitions would add to already piled up cases with the Courts 
for no just reason. Such an interpretation does not dovetail well with 
the object and purpose of the Act, which aims at ensuring that the 
disputes, inter se, the landlord and tenant are resolved in a cost 
effective and expeditious manner as is evident form the preamble of 
the Act: 
 
“Whereas it is expedient to regulate the 
relationship of landlord and tenant, to provide a 
mechanism for settlement of their disputes in an 
expeditious and cost effective manner and for 
connected matters” 
 
 
 
 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
Thus, when Section 15 of the Act, provides for eviction in cases 
where the tenancy has expired, it is nothing less than bizarre to 
contend that such ground has not been taken by the landlord and he 
must file a fresh eviction petition. It would have been a different 
situation, if the tenant had contended extension of tenancy on 
contractual basis which is not the case of the tenant. In case of 
admitted position as to the expiry of the tenancy, this Court as well 

9 
W.P. No.2292 of 2024 
 
 
as the Courts below can take judicial notice of the same and pass an 
eviction order. Hence, in the absence of a specific provision in the 
Act precluding the Courts from relying upon subsequent causes of 
action, this Court is inclined to hold that the order of eviction of the 
tenant can be validly passed on expiry of tenancy (expired during the 
pendency of the ejectment proceedings) even if said ground is not 
taken in the eviction petition. In this regard, I am fortified by the law 
laid down in case reported as “Muhammad Naseem Khan and 5 
others v. United Bank Limited, A Banking Company, Registered 
under the Companies Act, having its, registered office at I.I. 
Chundgrigar Road and Branch at Marriot Road, Karachi” (PLD 
2002 SC 753). In the said case, the order of High Court of Sindh 
was set aside, where the expiry of the tenancy was not considered as 
a valid ground since the same was not raised in the eviction petition. 
In case of Muhammad Naseem Khan supra, the eviction petition was 
filed on 11.04.1994 on ground of default and personal need wherein 
the tenant took the plea that the same was premature as tenancy was 
valid for a period of five years i.e., 31.12.1995 and the Rent 
Controller in the said case allowed the eviction petition on ground of 
personal need whereas issue of default was decided against the 
ejectment petitioner and both sides preferred appeals, which were 
decided by holding that the landlord therein had no ground to file 
eviction petition for personal bonafide need when the tenancy was 
subsisting in the year 1994 whereas the finding on ground of default 
was affirmed. Operative part is reproduced hereunder: 
“10.  
Learned 
High 
Court 
reversed 
the 
findings of the Rent Controller on extraneous 
considerations, which were based on proper 
appreciation of the evidence and law. The 
contention of learned A.O.R. for the respondent 
that expiry of the lease deed, in any case, does 
not come in the way of the tenant, is not tenable 
for the reason that the extension of lease is 

10 
W.P. No.2292 of 2024 
 
 
always contingent upon the consent of the 
landlord and such period cannot be extended 
unilaterally. Mst. Zehra Begun (supra) does not 
contemplate a perpetual lease in favour of tenant 
without the consent of the landlord. ……. They 
cannot be denied their right of occupation of the 
demised premises.” 
                             
 
 (Emphasis supplied) 
 
11. 
      In view of the above discussion, the present as well as 
connected petitions have no merits and hence, the same are 
dismissed. No order as to costs.
