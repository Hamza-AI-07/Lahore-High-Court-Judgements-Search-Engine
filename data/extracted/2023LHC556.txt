For the petitioner 
Mr. Javed Rehmat Gill, Advocate 
For Respondents 
No.1 to 3.  
Mr. Sohail Qaiser Tarar, Advocate.   
 
 
Raheel Kamran J:- Through this petition under Article 
199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
(“the Constitution”) the petitioners have assailed the judgment 
and decree dated 07.09.2019 passed by the learned Judge Family 
Court, Phalia whereby suit for dissolution of marriage, recovery 
of maintenance and dowry articles instituted by respondents 
No.1 to 3 was partially decreed in the terms that minors were 
held entitled to recover maintenance at the rate of Rs.20,000/- 
per head per month from the date of institution of the suit till 
their legal entitlement and petitioner was also held entitled to 
recover maintenance at the same rate for Iddat period as well as 
the judgment and decree dated 03.12.2019 passed by the learned 
Additional District Judge, Phalia whereby appeal of the 
petitioner against the aforementioned judgment and decree was 
dismissed.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners contends that in the 
terms of Rule 6 of the Family Court Act, 1964 (‘Act’) this Court 
has no jurisdiction and in the impugned judgment and decree 
specific issue in that regard was framed by the learned trial court, 
however, findings of the learned courts below on the said issue

W.P. No.30491 of 2021. 
are patently erroneous. While referring to the cross-examination 
of the plaintiff-respondent, learned counsel for the petitioner has 
emphasized that it is an admitted fact that minors in this case 
were born in Italy where they are residing and the cause of action 
for 
their 
maintenance, 
if 
any, 
covering 
their 
food, 
accommodation, health and education expenses arises in Italy, 
therefore, the courts in Italy possessed jurisdiction over the 
subject matter. In support of his contention, learned counsel for 
the petitioner has relied upon judgments in the cases of Shahdad 
Khan v. Judge Family Court, Rawalpindi and another (2014 
CLC 1238) and Major Muhammad Khalid Karim v. Mst. Saadia 
Yaqub and others (PLD 2012 SC 66).  
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondents states 
that the plaintiff-respondent No.1 was present within the 
territorial jurisdiction of this Court when the suit was instituted 
and learned courts below have rightly found the issue in favour 
of the plaintiff-respondent No.1. He has relied upon the 
judgment in the case of Muhammad Younas v. Shahzad Qamar 
& others (NLR 1982 CLJ 35).  
4. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
5. 
Out of divergent pleadings of the parties, learned trial 
court was pleased to frame Issue No.5 in the following terms: 
“5. 
Whether the instant suit does not lie and liable to be 
dismissed because plaintiff is residing in Italy and suit 
between the parties are also pending in Italy? OPD” 
 
6. 
In terms of Article 175(2) of the Constitution, no court 
has any jurisdiction save as is or may be conferred on it by the 
Constitution or by or under any law. Jurisdiction of the Family 
Court to entertain, hear and adjudicate upon matters specified in 
Part I of the Schedule to the Family Courts Act, 1964 (‘Act’) is 
governed by Section 5 of the Act. The matters specified in the 
Schedule to the Act include maintenance as Item No.3. On 
matters specified under the Act, Rule 6 of the Family Court 
Rules, 1965 governs territorial jurisdiction of a Family Court. In 

3 
W.P. No.30491 of 2021. 
terms of Rule 6 ibid, the Family Court which has jurisdiction to 
try a suit for maintenance is the one within the local limits of 
which the cause of action wholly or in part has arisen, or where 
the parties reside or last resided together.  
7. 
It is manifest from cross-examination of respondent No.1 
who deposed as PW1 that she made significant admissions 
relevant to adjudication of the issue No.5 concerning jurisdiction 
of the Family Court in the instant case. Admittedly, respondent 
No.1 and the petitioner moved to Italy to reside there only after 
a couple of months of their marriage solemnized on 16.11.2009 
where the minors were born. It was also admitted that since their 
marriage, respondent No.1 and her husband (the petitioner) 
alongwith the minors visited Pakistan two to three times. The 
minors are Italian citizens by birth who were admittedly residing 
in Italy. Nothing was produced in evidence to establish 
intentions of the private respondents to reside in Pakistan. 
Income of the petitioner was accruing in Italy where admittedly 
he was working and  all expenses for the maintenance of private 
respondents were to be incurred in Italy where they were 
residing. Like most of the members of the European Union, Italy 
is a welfare state that significantly contributes towards health, 
education and other benefits qua maintenance of its minor 
citizens, which are relevant to be taken into account for 
determining the quantum of maintenance to be decreed. From 
the above, it is thus established that not only the parties were 
residing in Italy but the cause of action for their maintenance 
apparently arose there upon which the courts in Italy could 
exercise jurisdiction. Therefore, suit for the recovery of 
maintenance of private respondents was not maintainable before 
the Family Court at Phalia. The learned courts below have 
manifestly acted in disregard of Rule 6 ibid while deciding issue 
No.5 in negative i.e. against the petitioner and in favour of the 
private respondents, therefore, the impugned judgment and 
decree liable to be reversed on that account.

W.P. No.30491 of 2021. 
8. 
Marriage of the petitioner with respondent No.1 was 
dissolved vide order and decree dated 03.04.2019 which is not 
under challenge before this Court. What has been assailed before 
this Court are judgments and decrees dated 07.09.2019 and 
03.12.2019 passed by the learned Judge Family Court, Phalia 
and learned Additional District Judge, Phalia in appeal 
respectively to which the instant decision is confined. 
9. 
For the foregoing reasons, this writ petition is allowed 
and the impugned judgments and decree of maintenance passed 
by the courts below are set aside and suit for the maintenance of 
respondents No.1 to 3 is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. There 
shall be no order as to costs.
