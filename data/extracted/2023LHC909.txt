Respondents by:

AHMAD NADEEM ARSHAD, J. Through this revision 
petition, petitioner has called into question the validity & legality of 
the judgment and decree dated 29.06.2015 of the learned Appellate 
Court, whereby while accepting the appeal of the respondents, 
judgment & decree dated 23.05.2012 of trial Court was set-aside 
and as a consequence thereof the suit of petitioner was dismissed.  
 
2. 
 
The facts as borne out of the pleadings of the parties 
are that predecessor of the petitioners namely Mst. Resham Begum 
instituted a suit for declaration, perpetual injunction and mandatory 
injunction on 13.10.2008 and sought declaration to the effect that 
she being daughter of Raggah and Mst. Rajjo is entitled to inherit

1/3rd share from the land measuring 50 acres, 01 kanal, 01 marla 
falling in Khewat No.83/77, khatoni No.42 to 52, situated at Chak 
No.363/EB, Tehsil Pakpattan, District Montgomery, presently 
Tehsil Burewala, District Vehari and the defendants have no 
concern whatsoever with the same and mutation No.2 dated 
19.03.1935, whereby, inheritance of Raggah son of Mangoo was 
sanctioned only in favour of his widow Mst. Rajjo, is against facts, 
law, void-ab-initio, having no effect upon her rights, liable to be 
set-aside and similarly mutation sanctioned in the month of 
September 1937 in favour of Achaar son of Mangoo (brother of 
Raggah) from Mst. Rajjo widow of Raggah and exchange mutation 
No.30 dated 24.05.1944 from Gehana etc. in favour of Provincial 
Government and all subsequent mutations are against facts, law, 
without notice, without jurisdiction, ex-parte, void, and liable to be 
cancelled having no effect upon her rights. She also prayed for the 
relief of perpetual injunction refraining defendants from asserting 
any right qua the suit property and also claimed mandatory 
injunction for the correction of the revenue record. She maintained 
in her plaint that Lot No.11 comprising land measuring 50 acres, 01 
kanal 01 marla was given on lease to Gehana son of Sahaman, 
Raggah son of Mangoo and Joiti daughter of Dev in the year 1930 
under the provision of Section 10 of the Colonization of 
Government Lands Act, 1912 (Act V of 1912) (hereinafter referred 
to as “the Act, 1912”); that one of the original allottee namely 
Raggah died in the year 1935 leaving behind a widow namely Mst.

Rajjo 
and 
daughter 
namely 
Mst. 
Resham 
Begum 
(petitioner/plaintiff); that his inheritance mutation No.2 was 
sanctioned on 19.03.1935only in the name of her widow  i.e. Mst. 
Rajjo; that Mst. Rajjo got married with Nainaa, therefore, mutation 
No.5 was sanctioned in favour of Achaar, the real brother of 
Raggah in the month of September, 1937; that subsequently 
exchange mutation No.30 was executed on 24.05.1944 vide 
Notification dated 29.11.1943 in faovur of Provincial Government 
and again exchange mutation No. 37 was attested in view of 
Notification No.299-D dated 21.01.1946 and the land of 
ChakNo.363/EB was transferred as alternative in Chak No. 377/EB 
to Ghana, etc.; that after the demise of Allah Rakhi widow of Allah 
Ditta her inheritance mutation No.13 dated 19.12.1961 was attested 
in favour of Grodas and so on; that parties are Christian and  
Christian Law of Inheritance is applicable upon them; that said 
inheritance mutations were sanctioned against Christian law of 
inheritance, so all the said inheritance mutations are void-ab-initio, 
and liable to be set-aside; that petitioner being real daughter of 
Raggah entitled to the whole share of Raggah son of Mangoo. The 
suit was resisted by defendants No.2 to 12, 20 to 22, through filing 
contesting written statement and raised certain preliminary 
objections such as the suit is time barred, not maintainable, the 
plaintiff approached the Court with un-clean hands, the suit is 
barred for mis-joinder and non-joinder of necessary parties and on 
facts alleged that Resham Begum D/o Raggah was not alive at the 

Civil Revision No.907 of 2015. 
-4-
time of demise of Raggah, however, admitted that Raggah had a 
daughter namely Resham Begum who was died in his life time; that 
after the death of Raggah her widow contracted marriage with one 
Nainaa and from said wedlock a baby girl was born who was also 
given the name of Resham; that present plaintiff namely Resham 
Begum is not the same Resham Begum who was daughter of 
Raggah but she is the Resham Begum who was born from the 
wedlock of Nainaa with Mst. Rajjo, therefore, she is not entitled for 
any inheritance from Raggah and prayed for dismissal of the suit. 
Learned trial Court, keeping in view divergent pleadings of the 
parties framed necessary issues and invited the parties to produce 
their respective evidence, after recording evidence of the parties pro 
and contra, oral as well as documentary decreed the suit vide 
judgment and decree dated 23.05.2012. Feeling aggrieved, 
respondents preferred an appeal which was allowed by the learned 
appellate Court vide judgment and decree dated 29.06.2015. Being 
dis-satisfied petitioner approached this Court through instant Civil 
Revision. 
 
3. 
 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties and 
perused the record with their able assistance. 
 
4. 
 
Petitioner mainly challenged mutation No.2 dated 
19.03.1935 through which inheritance of Raggah was transferred 
only to his widow namely Mst. Rajjo and mutation No.5 sanctioned 
in the month of September, 1937 through which the property 
inherited by Mst. Rajjo was transferred. The petitioner claimed that 

Civil Revision No.907 of 2015. 
-5-
she is real daughter of Raggah and according to the Christian Law 
she is entitled to inherit the property owned by Raggah, whereas, 
the stance of the respondents was that although Raggah had a 
daughter with the name of Mst. Resham Begum but she died during 
his life time and after the death of said Raggah, his widow namely 
Mst. Rajjo inherited his property who contracted second marriage 
with Nainaa and as a result of said marriage a girl was born who 
was also given the name of Resham Begum, and plaintiff Resham 
Begum is not daughter of Raggah rather daughter of Nainaa, 
therefore, the mutations were rightly sanctioned. The learned trial 
Court reduced the said controversy by framing issues No.1, 2 & 3 
and after full-fledged trial, in the light of evidence brought on 
record concluded that plaintiff is the daughter of Raggah, set-aside 
the impugned mutations and decreed her suit. The learned appellate 
Court reversed the findings of the learned trial Court mainly on the 
grounds that firstly the petitioner failed to establish that she is 
daughter of Raggah and secondly that her suit is badly time barred. 
 
5. 
 
The respondents alleged that at the demise of Raggah, 
his daughter namely Resham was not alive, therefore, the 
inheritance mutation was sanctioned only in favour of his widow 
Mst Rajjo.  But this fact was negated itself by the mutation No.2 
dated 19.03.1935, (brought on record as Exh.P-1 and Exh.D-1) 
whereby, the Revenue Officer while sanctioning the inheritance 
mutation of Raggah admitted the presence of a minor daughter of 
deceased namely Mst. Resham. For the sake of clarification order 

Civil Revision No.907 of 2015. 
-6-
passed by Revenue Officer at the time of sanctioning of mutation 
No.2 dated 19.03.1935 (Exh.P-1/Exh.D-1) is reproduced in 
verbatim as     under:-

 19.03.35 - 
 "
 
 
 
Perusal of said order it is abundantly clear that at the time of 
sanctioning of inheritance mutation No.2 of Raggah, his daughter 
namely Resham was alive but she was not given any share from his 
inheritance and share of Raggah was inherited only to his widow 
namely Mst. Rajjo. Respondents failed to rebut the findings 
recorded by Revenue Officer at the time of sanctioning of mutation 
on 19.03.1935, whereby, he admitted presence of a daughter of 
Raggah with the name of Resham.  
Respondents also alleged that the plaintiff with a name of 
Resham Begum is not the same lady who is daughter of Raggah, 
rather she is daughter of Mst. Rajjo and Nainaa. As this fact was 
alleged by respondents, therefore, it was their duty to prove this fact 
through reliable and trust worthy evidence but they failed to 
discharge initial burden. Therefore, it is concluded that plaintiff Mst. 
Resham Begum was the same lady who born from the wed-lock of 
Raggah with Mst. Rajjo. 
 
6. 
 
 Now question for determination is whether mutation 
No.2 and mutation No.5 (which are basic mutations) were rightly 
sanctioned or not in presence of Mst. Resham Begum daughter of 
Raggah.

Undeniably, the suit property was allotted to Gehana 
son of Sahaman, Raggah son of Mangoo and Juti daughter of Dev 
in the year 1930 on lease under the provision of Section 10 of the 
Act, 1912.  The status of Raggah upon the suit property was of 
tenant/ original tenant. Section 3 of the Act, 1912 defines the terms 
tenant and original tenant which read as under: - 
“Tenant:- Means any person holding land in a colony as a 
tenant of Government and includes the predecessors and 
successors-in-interest of a tenant”.  
 “Original Tenant: Means any person to whom a tenancy is 
first allotted by the collector and includes the male 
transferee of such a tenant and any male nominated by the 
Collector in accordance with the provision of section 21 to 
succeeds a female to whom a tenancy was first allotted.” 
 
8. 
 
Section 20 of the Act, 1912 deals with inheritance of 
tenancy rights which describes that upon the death of original 
tenant, in the absence of male lineal descendants, the tenancy shall 
devolve upon the widow of the tenant until she dies or remarries, 
failing the widow tenancy to devolve upon the un-married 
daughters of the tenant until they died or marry or lose their rights 
under the provisions of the Act, 1912. For reference Section 20 of 
the Act, 1912 is reproduced as under: - 
“20. Succession to tenants acquiring otherwise than by succession. 
Subject to the proviso to section 14, when, after the commencement of 
this Act, any original tenant dies the succession to the tenancy shall 
devolve in the following order upon. 
 
(a)  
the male lineal descendants of the tenant in the male line of 
descent. (The term „lineal descendants‟ shall include an adopted 
son whose adoption has been ratified by a registered deed);  
 
(b)  
the widow of the tenant until she dies, or remarries or loses her 
rights under the provisions of this Act;  
 
(c) 
the unmarried daughters of the tenant until they die or marry, or 
use their rights under the provisions of this Act;  
 

Civil Revision No.907 of 2015. 
-8-
(d)  
the successor or successors nominated by the tenant by 
registered deed from among the following persons, that is to say, 
his mother, [his pre-deceased son‟s widow, his pre-deceased 
grandson‟s widow], his married daughter, his daughter‟s son, 
his sister, his sister‟s son, and the male agnate members of his 
family; and  
 
(e)  
the successor or successors nominated by the Collector from 
among the persons enumerated in clause (d) of this section.” 
 
 
9. 
 
The rules of succession contained in clauses “a”, “b”, 
& “c” of Section 20 of the Act, 1912 provide that a widow inherited 
the tenancy under Section 20(b) in the absence of male lineal and is 
subject to the condition that she will hold the estate only till she 
remarries or dies or otherwise losses her right under the provisions 
of the Act, 1912. Meaning thereby, the estate being conferred on 
her was only limited one and the character of this limited estate was 
determined only by the statute. Whereas, in presence of widow, 
daughters will not inherit the tenancy rights and they will only 
succeed under Clause “c” when neither any male lineal descendants 
are available nor any widow is survived at the time of opening of 
succession of tenancy rights. 
 
10. 
 
Section 20 of the Act, 1912, governs the succession to 
the tenancy rights of the original tenant whereas, section 21 of the 
Act, 1912, contains the rule of successions of the tenant who 
inherited the same from the original tenant. For reference Section 
21 of the Act, 1912 is reproduced as under: - 
“21. Succession to tenants acquiring by succession.— When, after the 
commencement of this Act any male tenant, who is not an original tenant, 
dies, or any female tenant dies, marries or re-marries, the succession to 
the tenancy shall devolve:- 
 
(a)  
in the case of a female, to whom the tenancy has been first 
allotted, on the successor nominated by the Collector from the 
issue of such female tenant, or from the male agnates of the 

Civil Revision No.907 of 2015. 
-9-
person, on account of whose services the tenancy was allotted to 
her; 
(b)  
in all other cases, on the person or persons, who would succeed 
if the tenancy were agricultural land acquired by the original 
tenant.” 
 
 
 
11. 
 
Sections 20 & 21 of the Act, 1912, therefore, 
embodied two different rules of successions to the tenancy of 
deceased tenant applicable in different situations. Section 20 of the 
Act, 1912 applies to successions of tenants who are original tenants 
whereas Section 21 governs the case of the tenants who acquires by 
the succession the tenancy.  
 
12. 
 
After demise of Raggah, his inheritance mutation No.2 
was sanctioned in favour of his widow Mst. Rajjo under section 
20(b) of the Act, 1912 as a limited owner with some conditions i.e. 
until she dies or remarries or loses her rights under the provisions 
of the Act, 1912. Admittedly, Mst. Rajjo, contracted second 
marriage with one namely Nainaa, therefore, mutation No.5 was 
sanctioned as she lost her right to retain the property of Raggah 
because of her re-marriage. For convenience order passed by the 
Revenue Officer for sanctioning of said mutation is reproduced in 
verbatim as under:-

In this way, through said mutation No.5 share inherited to 
Mst. Rajjo from her husband Raggah was transferred to Achaar son 
of Mangoo, legal heirs of Bahgtoo and legal heirs of Karkoo. 
 
13. 
 
There is no cavil with the proposition that after the full 
price is made and the proprietary rights are conferred in respect of 
land allotted to the tenant under the provisions of Act, 1912, the 
tenancy comes to an end and the allottee comes out of the ambit of 
the statements of conditions of allotment but before that the matter 
relating to inheritance of the tenancy governed by the Act, 1912 as 
describes in Section 15 of the Act, 1912 which reads as under:- 
“15. Purchaser to be tenant pending payment in full of purchase 
money.— A purchaser from [Government] of land who has been 
placed in possession of the land by order of the Collector shall be 
deemed to be a tenant of such land until the full amount of the 
purchase money with any interest due thereon has been paid and 
the other conditions set forth in the statement of the conditions of 
sale issued by the Collector have been fulfilled.” 
 
 
Admittedly at that time neither full payment was made nor 
proprietary rights were conferred upon the original tenant, therefore, 
the status of Raggah was merely a tenant upon the suit property and 
his tenancy rights to be inherited according to the Act, 1912. 
 
14. 
 
The matter of Christian inheritance in the subcontinent 
including our country is governed by the provisions of Part-V 
Chapters I & II, section 29 & 37 of the Succession Act, 1925. In 

Civil Revision No.907 of 2015. 
-11-
case of Christians whereby in intestate succession, the property of 
the deceased would be inherited by the surviving child and if more 
than one, it shall be equally divided amongst all the surviving 
children. As held by august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case 
of “Mst. Inayat Bibi through legal heirs v. Issac Nazir Ullah and 
two others” (PLD 1992 SC 385) that the Customary Successions, 
so far as Christian are concerned, was altered by the Succession Act, 
1925, whereby the same was abolished in the Punjab and Christian 
female was allowed to inherit in presence of the male heirs and in 
the light of Succession Act, 1925, by statutory dispensation having 
determined the mode of succession when a Christian male died 
neither the custom nor any other law would be applicable. The 
present case is not a case of inheritance of the property of a 
Christian rather it is a case of inheritance of a tenancy rights, 
therefore, it will be dealt with according to the provisions of the Act, 
1912. 
  
15. 
 
Perusal of orders passed by Revenue Officer while 
sanctioning mutation No.2, it appears that it was sanctioned under 
Section 20(b) of the Act, 1912 whereas mutation No.5 was 
sanctioned in favour of Achaar etc., when Mst. Rajjo contracted 
second marriage in the light of Section 21(b) of the Act, 1912. Both 
the mutations were sanctioned in accordance with the law 
applicable upon the tenancy rights of Raggah and Mst. Resham 
Begum was rightly excluded from his inheritance.  
 

Civil Revision No.907 of 2015.

16. 
 
Next question for determination is that whether suit of 
the petitioner is within time. Petitioner instituted the suit on 
13.10.2008 by challenging the vires of mutation No.2 dated 
19.03.1935 and mutation No.5 dated 03.08.1937/September, 1937 
after the lapse of 73/75 years. Learned trial Court framed issue 
No.4 with regard to limitation and decided the same in favour of 
plaintiff. The learned appellate Court while meeting with arguments 
of learned trial Court reversed the findings. Learned trial Court with 
the impression that as the superior courts held that limitation does 
not run against the rights of inheritance declared that suit was not 
barred by law. The learned appellate Court reversed the said 
findings on the ground that plaintiff was fully conscious and aware 
of her rights for last more than 50 years and did nothing except 
asking defendants to give her due share but did not approach any 
proper forum for redressal of her grievance and when  she 
approached in the year 1955, her suits as per her own version were 
dismissed and concluded that her suit is barred by time. A sweeping 
statement that there was no limitation in case of inheritance would 
in fact tantamount to have re-written the law of limitation. Public 
interest requires that there should be an end to the litigation. 
Whoever wishes to dispute the presumption of   co-incidents of 
facts and right must do so within the period provided by law, 
otherwise, his right if any will be forfeited as a penalty for such 
neglect. Law requires that persons aggrieved by any order of         

Civil Revision No.907 of 2015. 
-13-
an authority must come to the Court and take recourse to the legal 
remedies with the due diligence.  
 
17. 
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan while 
observing that law of limitation was not to be ignored entirely or 
brushed aside whenever property was claimed on the basis of 
inheritance, in a case titled “Mst. GRANA through Leal Heirs and 
others versus SAHIB KAMALA BIBI and others” (PLD 2014 SC 
167) held as under: - 
 
“6. It appears that in a suit which involves some element of 
inheritance the Courts are generally quick to declare that 
the law of limitation would not be attracted. It is not in all 
cases of inheritance that the question of limitation becomes 
irrelevant. Even in Ghulam Ali's case the Court recognized 
that there could be exceptional circumstances wherein a 
suit based on inheritance issue of limitation may become 
relevant. This Court recently in some cases had invoked the 
principle of time limitation and acquiescence of the plaintiff 
material in suits of inheritance. In Mst. Phaphan v. 
Muhammad Bakhsh (2005 SCMR 1278) a suit for 
declaration and possession was filed in the year 1983 by the 
plaintiff/petitioner claiming to be the owner of the inherited 
property. The suit was held to be barred by time wherein 
mutations of the year 1959 and 1967 were challenged in the 
year 1983 when the plea of the defendants was that the 
plaintiffs had alienated the property of her own free-will. 
The plaintiff's plea of being pardanashin lady and reliance 
on the case of Ghulam Ali was not accepted as the plaintiff 
was found to have remained in deep slumber for 24 years 
despite the fact that the physical possession of the land was 
passed on to the defendant. Recently in the case of Lal Khan 
v Muhammad Yousaf (PLD 2011 SC 657) this Court had set 
aside the concurrent findings of the three Courts and 
dismissed the suit filed on 13-5-1970, where the plaintiff 
had challenged inheritance mutation of 13-2-1947; the 
Court held it to be barred by time. The rationale of the law 
of limitation has been reiterated in Atta Muhammad v. 
Maula Bakhsh (2007 SCMR 1446) where the concurrent 
findings of the three Courts were set aside and the suit filed 
by the respondents/plaintiffs in the year 1988 questioning 
the inheritance mutation of 1942 was declared to be barred 
by time. The Court held:-- 

Civil Revision No.907 of 2015. 
-14-
"The law of limitation provides an element of 
certainty in the conduct of human affairs. Statutes of 
limitation and prescription are, thus, statutes of 
peace and repose. In order to avoid the difficulty and 
errors that necessarily result from lapse of time, the 
presumption of coincidence of fact and right is 
rightly accepted as final after a certain number of 
years. Whoever wishes to dispute this presumption 
must do so, within that period; otherwise his rights if 
any, will be forfeited as a penalty for his neglect. In 
other words the law of limitation is a law which is 
designed to impose quietus on legal dissensions and 
conflicts. It requires that persons must come to Court 
and take recourse to legal remedies with due 
diligence. There have been cases where even to 
claim inheritance law of limitation was applied." 
 
The Court found that the real dispute was whether a 
particular person was or not a legal heir of one, Mst. 
Khairan, whose inheritance mutation was attested in favour 
of appellant, Atta Muhammad. 
7. It emerges from the afore discussed case-law that the law 
of limitation is not entirely to be ignored or brushed aside 
whenever property is claimed on the basis of inheritance. 
The conduct of such claimant may become relevant and 
material when the bar of time limitation is pleaded by the 
adversary. A defendant may show that the plaintiff by her or 
his acts, overt or implicit, had demonstrated acquiescence 
in the defendant's title to the suit properly thereby allowing 
him to deal with it as exclusive owner, for instance 
regularly and openly disposing of parts of the property or 
developing it at his own expense over a period of time 
within the knowledge of the plaintiff. When in such 
circumstances the defendant/heirs transfers the property for 
valuable consideration the transferee is entitled to believe 
that the transferor had a valid title to transfer. It may be 
reiterated that in Ghulam Ali's case the question of interest 
protection of transferees from a legal heir in a suit of 
inheritance was left open as the transferees were not 
impleaded as defendants. That is not the case here. The very 
facts of this case would demonstrate that the plaintiff had 
acquiesced in the various transfers made of the suit 
property from time to time.” 
 
In a recent judgment, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of  
Pakistan tilted “Syed KAUSAR ALI SHAH and others versus Syed 

Civil Revision No.907 of 2015. 
-15-
FARHAT HUSSAIN SHAH and others” (2022 SCMR 1558) held as 
under: - 
“10. In our opinion there is a clear distinction between (a) 
cases in which an heir alleges that his/her rights to 
inheritance have been disregarded and his/her share not 
mentioned in the inheritance mutation, and (b) those cases 
in which such an heirs its idly by, does not challenge 
mutation entries of long standing, or acquiesces, and only 
comes forward when third party rights in the subject land 
have been created. To succeed in respect of the latter (b) 
category cases an heir must demonstrate that he/she was 
not aware of having been deprived, give cogent reasons for 
not challenging the property record of long standing, and 
show complicity between the buyer and the seller (the 
ostensible owner) or that the buyer knew of such heir's 
interest yet proceeded to acquire the land. If these two 
categories are kept in mind, then the judgments of this 
court, respectively relied by both sides, which are 
apparently at variance, become reconcilable. 
 
It was further held that: - 
 
 The learned Judges of the subordinate courts and the 
learned single Judge of the Islamabad High Court 
disregarded the abovementioned judgments of this Court, 
the principle of acquiescence, and the fact of third party 
interest having been created in the said Land, and that 
further third parties had acquired proprietary rights in the 
said Land. And, that such interest was acquired in land 
which was shown in the record of rights of long standing, 
which remained unchallenged. The learned Judges also 
ignored the fact that Ummat-ul-Aziz took no action for 
forty-five years, and that she submitted her application to 
the revenue authorities only after the creation of the third 
party interest in the said Land. The plaintiffs, having stood 
idly by allowed third party interest to be created in the said 
Land, and could then not complain and claim the said 
Land.” 
 
Therefore, the findings of learned appellate Court with regard 
to limitation does not require for any interference.

For the foregoing reasons, the instant revision petition 
is without any force, the judgment and decree of learned appellate 
Court with regard to the dismissal of the suit is maintained and 
upheld, however, on other grounds as mentioned supra, resultantly, 

Civil Revision No.907 of 2015.

the instant Revision Petition is hereby, dismissed leaving the parties 
to bear their own costs.
