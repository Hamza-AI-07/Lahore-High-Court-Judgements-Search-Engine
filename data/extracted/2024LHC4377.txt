Sheikh Jamshaid Hayat, Advocate for petitioner. 
Mr. Ijaz Ahmad Gurmani, Advocate for respondents. 
 
 
  
  
Instant constitutional petition impugns concurrent 
decisions, in terms whereof suit for jactitation of 
marriage, instituted by respondent No.3, was decreed 
by the Family Court and same was affirmed by the 
Appellate Court, consequently alleged Nikah between 
the petitioner and respondent No.3 was declared void 
for all intents and purposes.  
 
2. Facts, essential for adjudication, are that petitioner 
alleged marriage with respondent No.3 and brought 
action for restitution of conjugal rights. Conversely, 
respondent No.3 sought declaration against alleged 
claim of marriage, who alleged that she was abducted 
and subjected to sign documents and made statements 
without freewill and affording independent decision-
making choice. Trial court framed issues and recorded 
evidence which declared marriage invalid. Petitioner 
remained unsuccessful before the Appellate Court. 
 
3. Learned counsel for the petitioner emphasized that 
respondent No.3 renegaded from her previous position/ 
stand, who had filed various petitions and made 
statements, including statement under section 164 of 

2 
 
W.P. No.3022 of 2023 
Criminal Procedure Code 1898, acknowledging her 
status as lawfully wedded wife of the petitioner. 
Submits that Nikah Khawan appeared before the 
criminal court, in case FIR No. 203 dated 07.06.2020 
under sections 365-B of Pakistan Penal Code 1860, 
who affirmed solemnization of Sharai nikah between 
petitioner and respondent No.3.  
 
4. Conversely, learned counsel for respondent No.3 
supported concurrent decisions, hereby impugned.  
 
5. Heard. Record perused.  
 
6. Evidence is examined threadbare. Conduct, 
relationship and execution of Nikah Nama was 
categorically denied by respondent No.3 in the plaint 
and as witness. Petitioner, who alleged existence of 
valid marriage, and sought decree of conjugal rights 
utterly failed to prove conduct of marriage, who was 
evasive regarding sharai nikah in the written 
statement, later pleaded conduct of sharai nikah, which 
obviously is an afterthought. Petitioner produced 
Nikah Nama Exh.D-2 but failed to prove execution, 
validity and lawfulness thereof. Even otherwise 
requirements of a valid Nikah in terms of Muslim 
Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 were not proved. 
Petitioner testified that Nikah was arranged and 
conducted in the office of the lawyer, where good 10-
12 persons were sitting, none of which was produced 
as witness. Evidence of DW-2-Muhammad Arshad-did 
not inspire any confidence, who submitted affidavit –
[Mark-B]- stating against marriage between petitioner 
and respondent No.3, but when confronted with it, he 
stated that he was under pressure. Muhammad Arshad 
was shown as representative of the bride, who admitted

W.P. No.3022 of 2023 
having acquaintance with the lady because she worked 
at the medical clinic of the petitioner – this 
substantiates allegation by respondent No.3 against 
petitioner that latter abducted her. Arshad’s evidence 
had no weightage or value. No witnesses of Nikah 
Nama were produced. Advocate in whose chamber 
Nikah was allegedly solemnized was not produced. 
Assertion that respondent No.3 submitted petitions and 
appeared in courts, made statement before Magistrate, 
have had little value in the context of allegations 
levelled by respondent No.3 against the petitioner. 
Even 
otherwise 
voluntariness 
and 
truthfulness, 
essential ingredients of statement under section 164 of 
Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 were not proved. No 
lawyer was produced to prove that lady had signed 
petitions / affidavit and appeared in person before the 
court. It is not denied that respondent No.3 worked at 
Medical Clinic, run by the petitioner. Respondent No.3 
appeared as PW-1, who was cross examined on the 
point of her affidavit and statements made but she 
categorically denied. In suit(s) for jactitation of 
marriage, where lady had disowned marriage and her 
statement, when she had denied having exercised free-
will and was terrorized or put in awful fear of harm / 
injury and physical abuse, is critical. Even otherwise 
self-harming statements carry more authenticity, high 
evidentiary value and deserve more credibility and 
weightage, as compared to the evidence of the 
petitioner, read in the context of the apparent motive, 
intending to avoid incriminating charges in criminal 
case – which manifest tendency of misrepresenting the 
facts.  
 
  
Insistence of learned counsel on the statement of 
Nikah Khawan in criminal case has no evidentiary

value, which piece 
of 
evidence 
is 
otherwise 
inadmissible, 
for 
failing 
to 
undergo 
test 
of 
confrontation. 
Nikah 
Khawan/Nikah 
Registrar 
appeared as PW.6, who was never confronted with 
alleged statement before criminal court, alleging 
solemnizing of sharai nikah. Nikah Khawan otherwise 
testified against petitioner. In the circumstances, 
statement, not confronted to the witness, had no 
evidentiary value, besides being otherwise attracting 
inadmissibility. Case-law cited by counsel for the 
petitioner, reported as “MST. FARHAT JABEEN. VS. 
MUHAMMAD SAFDAR and others.” (2011 SCMR 
1073) is distinguishable on facts. Conversely, ratio of 
the decision in the case of “MATLOOB HUSSAIN. 
VS.MST. SHAHIDA and 2 others.” (PLD 2006 SC 
489) is more proximate, illustrative and supports the 
case of respondent No.3.  
 
7. No interference warranted to disturb concurrent 
findings 
and 
conclusions 
under 
constitutional 
jurisdiction, in absence of any illegality and material 
defect.  
 
 8. Petition is meritless and same is, hereby, 
dismissed.
