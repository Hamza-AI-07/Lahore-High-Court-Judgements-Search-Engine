Mr. Muhammad Anwar Bhaur, Advocate for the 
petitioner.  
 
 
 
 
Through this civil revision, filed under section 
115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (the ‘Code’), 
the revision-petitioner has called into question the 
validity of order and decree dated 09.04.2022 passed by 
the learned Civil Judge Ist Class, Pattoki as well as 
judgment and decree dated 09.09.2023 passed by the 
learned Additional District Judge, Pattoki. 
2.  
Brief facts of the case are that on 11.12.2015 the 
revision-petitioner instituted suit for possession through 
specific performance of agreement dated 04.12.2014 / 
Exh.P-1 (the ‘agreement’), allegedly executed between 
the revision-petitioner and the respondent with respect to 
property as described in the suit (the ‘property’). The 
process of adducing evidence was in progress when an 
application dated 09.04.2022 (the ‘application’) for 
administration of special oath was filed by the revision-
petitioner. The offer contained therein was accepted by 
the respondent and as a consequence of the same oath of 
Muhammad Riaz son of Khushi Muhammad was 
administered and on the basis of the same, the suit was 
dismissed on 09.04.2022. The said decision was assailed 
through Civil Appeal No. 58 of 2022 by the revision-
petitioner, which was dismissed on 09.09.2023 by the 
learned Appellate Court. Aggrieved from the same, the 
present revision petition has been filed.

3. 
Mr. Muhammad Anwar Bhaur, learned counsel 
for the revision-petitioner, has submitted that concurrent 
findings of the learned two Courts below are against the 
facts of the case as well as the law applicable thereupon; 
that Muhammad Riaz, when appeared as DW-2, made 
some false statement, which disturbed the revision-
petitioner, due to which he made the offer for 
administration of special oath. Learned counsel has 
relied upon the cases titled “Khushi Muhammad through 
L.Rs. vs. Mst. Nazira Bibi and 4 others” (2007 CLC 
1874), “Muhammad Ali vs. Major Muhammad Aslam 
and others” (PLD 1990 SC 841) and “Ahmad Khan and 
others vs. Jewan” (PLD 2002 SC 655) and stated that 
the learned trial Court should have acted carefully to see 
that the statement is not recorded in snap speed and the 
learned trial Court should not have acted so promptly 
rather every possibility of ambiguity or emotions should 
have been ruled out before permitting the administration 
of oath and / or to rest the decision on such oath. No 
other ground is pressed before this Court. 
4. 
I have heard the arguments and carefully gone 
through the documents available on the record, with the 
able assistance of the learned counsel of the revision-
petitioner.  
5. 
Section 9 of the Oaths Act, 1873 (the ‘Act’) 
provides that if any party offers to be bound by special 
oath or solemn affirmation, as mentioned in section 8 of 
the Act, the Court if thinks fit, can communicate the 
offer to other party or witness concerned. Section 10 of 
the Act provides that upon acceptance of the offer the 
learned Court can proceed with the administration of 
oath. The evidence / oath so given then in terms of 
Section 11 of the Act, is binding upon the person who 

Civil revision No. 66481-2023 
 
3 
 
made the offer and it is deemed to be conclusive proof 
of the matter stated therein. 
6. 
In case titled “Saleem Ahmad vs. Khushi 
Muhammad” (1974 SCMR 224), the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan reached to the conclusion that one cannot claim 
the right to resile from solemn agreement. The 
contracting parties could not be allowed to back out 
from the same unless the contract was void or had 
become frustrated. In one of recent judgment in case 
titled “Sajid Mehmood vs. Mst. Shazia Azad and others” 
(2023 SCMR 153), where one of the party filed an 
application for special oath and then after administration 
of the oath attempted to depart, the following has been 
observed:-. 
 “6.The 
letter 
of 
the 
law 
makes 
it 
unequivocally clear that under the provisions of 
the Oaths Act, a party in litigation can offer the 
opposite party to accept or reject the claim on 
special oath, but they cannot compel each other 
to take the special oath, however if the offer is 
accepted by the other party then a binding 
agreement comes into existence and the party 
making the offer has no right and authority in 
law to resile from it. When the Court 
communicates the offer to the other party and 
gets hold of his assent or refusal, as the case 
may be, it in fact plays a role as an intermediary 
between the parties and when the offer is 
accepted by the other party, the acceptance is 
transmitted to the party inviting the other to take 
special oath, thereafter the agreement is 
completed between the parties unless the offer is 
withdrawn before its acceptance by the other 
side. The stipulations of the Oaths Act cannot be 
construed to give an unfair or inequitable 
advantage to one party over the other, so in the 
event of an offer or proposal to be bound by the 
oath of the opposite party, then obviously, due to 
the mutuality of the promise between them, the 
party making an offer has no right to resile from 
it after the offer is accepted and the special oath 
is taken. In the absence of any such satisfactory 
or sufficient cause the Court is obligated to 
implement the agreement and to record the 
statement of the party concerned to make a 
decision in the case accordingly. The petitioner 

Civil revision No. 66481-2023

cannot wriggle out or withdraw his offer which 
was given by him voluntarily before the Family 
Court and the same acted upon according to his 
will.” 
  
 
 
     (Underlining is added) 
 
7. 
Reverting to the facts of the case, the proceedings 
in the suit were at the stage of producing evidence. The 
revision-petitioner completed his evidence and when the 
evidence of the respondent was being recorded, the 
revision-petitioner filed the application which clearly 
reveals that the revision-petitioner was desirous to have 
decision on special oath. The relevant paragraph of the 
application reads as follows:- 
"
 ہی ہک اسلئ / دمیع دوعیٰ ونعان ب ال اک
رآن رکواب ا اچاتہ ےہ
 
ہلصیف ب  رفلح ق  ہک
  ارگ اجنمن   دماعہیلع شیپ رکدہ وگاہ دمحم رب اض ودل وخیش دمحم ارگ روب  رو دعال
 رآن ب اک رپ فلح دے رک دماع ہیلع وصےب دنی ےن آرایض دتموعہی اک
 
وضحر ق
 وسدا عیب رمہاہ دمیع ہن ایک ےہ اور ہن یہ غلبم 
2100000/-
 اسیک الھک
 روہیپ ووصل ایک اور ہن یہ ہضبق آرایض دتموعہی دمیع ےک ب اس ےہ وت دمیع اک 
رامدب ا اجےئ
 
دوعیٰ اخرج ق وت نم اسلئ وک ارتعاض ہن وہاگ۔"
 
 
 
8. 
The revision-petitioner offered in terms of 
section 9 of the Act. The application is signed by the 
revision-petitioner as well as his learned counsel. The 
application was filed after three days of the relevant 
event i.e. the statement of Muhammad Riaz / DW-2, 
upon which the revision-petitioner showed satisfaction 
to make the offer in question. This offer was accepted by 
the other side as well as the witness concerned and the 
learned Court proceeded to administer the special oath 
of Muhammad Riaz son of Khushi Muhammad in terms 
of the Act.  
9. 
There appears to be no haste, in making the offer 
or its acceptance. The revision-petitioner took his time, 
then instructed learned lawyer to make the offer, who 
after drafting the application obtained signatures of the 
revision-petitioner on the application. Thereafter, the 

Civil revision No. 66481-2023 
 
5 
 
statements of the learned counsel for the parties are 
recorded, which are followed by the special oath. The 
wording of the application as well as the order dated 
09.04.2022 reveal that there was no ambiguity as to the 
offer or the significance upon acceptance. The revision-
petitioner was fully aware that the statement on oath, if 
given shall be binding upon him and it can have 
consequence of dismissal of the suit, therefore, the 
reliance by the learned counsel on “Khushi Muhammad 
through L.Rs”,“Muhammad Ali” and “Ahmad Khan 
and others” cases (supra), is of no help to the revision-
petitioner.  
10. 
The learned trial Court noticeably remained 
careful. Not only the written request duly signed by the 
revision-petitioner, containing his verification, was 
brought on the record but at the same time the 
statements of the learned counsel for the parties were 
recorded. The consequences of the offer were very clear 
to the revision-petitioner. The revision-petitioner cannot 
be allowed to back out from a statement / offer after it 
has culminated into a binding contract and when the 
contract has been acted upon. This attempt to withdraw 
from the statement and the dual stance also attract the 
principle of approbate and reprobate with its full force. 
Reference can be made to case titled “Muhammad 
Rafique vs. Nasir Mehmood” (PLD 2016 Lahore 428). 
11. 
There is no substance in the grounds taken in this 
revision-petition. Therefore, this revision petition is 
dismissed in limine. No order as to cost.
