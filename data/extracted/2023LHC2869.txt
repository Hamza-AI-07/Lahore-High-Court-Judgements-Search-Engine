AALIA NEELUM, J:- The appellant-Ali Ahsan alias Sunny, 
son of Anwar Hussain, Caste Balouch, resident of Basti Mai Roshan Tehsil 
Kallur Kot, District Bhakkar, along with his co-accused, was involved in the

further. The benefit of Section 382-B of Cr.P.C was also extended in favour 
of the accused. 
2. 
 
Feeling aggrieved by the trial court’s judgment, Ali Ahsan alias 
Sunny, the appellant, has assailed his conviction and sentence by filing the 
instant appeal bearing Criminal Appeal No.193932 of 2018. The trial court 
also referred M.R. No.164 of 2018 (The State. Vs. Ali Ahsan alias Sunny) 
to confirm the death sentence awarded to the appellant-Ali Ahsan alias 
Sunny. Whereas the complainant also filed Crl. Appeal No.206624 of 2018 
against the acquittal of respondent No.2, namely Touseef. All the matters 
arising from the same judgment of the trial court are being disposed of 
through a single judgment. 
3. 
 
The prosecution story, as alleged in the F.I.R (Ex.PF/1) lodged 
on the statement (Ex.PF) of Muhammad Khalid (PW-8)-the complainant, is 
that on 15.07.2017, at about 06:15 p.m., the complainant (PW-8) along with 
Arsalan (given up-PW) and Nadir Ali (PW-9) was standing near Masjid 
Jafaria, Village Basti Mai Roshan, whereas son of the complainant namely 
Saddam Khalid (deceased) was coming towards his house from the cattle 
shed of his “Mamoo” Nasir Hussain and when he reached near the masjid 
Jafaria, the accused, Ali Ahsan alias Sunny (the appellant) along with his co-
accused while equipped with their respective weapons emerged there and 
raised lalkara not to spare Saddam Khalid; after that, they all started to give 
fist blows upon the person of Saddam Khalid; then the accused, Touseef (co-
accused since acquitted), Zaheer Abbas (co-accused since P.O) and Yawar 
Abbas (co-accused since P.O) caught hold of Saddam Khalid (the deceased) 
and Ali Ahsan alias Sunny (the appellant) made a knife blow which hit 
Saddam Khalid (deceased) on his chest. After that, Ali Ahsan alias Sunny 
(the appellant) made a second knife blow, which landed upon the left flank 
of Saddam Khalid (deceased).  After receiving said injuries, Saddam Khalid 
(the deceased) fell, whereas the accused, Ali Ahsan alias Sunny (the 
appellant), decamped from the place of occurrence after brandishing a knife; 
after that, the complainant (PW-8) along with Arsalan (given up-PW) and 
Nadir Ali (PW-9) shifted Saddam Khalid (deceased) in injured condition to

Crl. Appeal No.206624 of 2018

Tehsil Headquarter Hospital, Kallur Kot, who succumbed to the injuries. 
The motive behind the occurrence was that, two days back, an altercation 
occurred between Saddam Kahlid (the deceased) and Ali Ahsan alias Sunny, 
etc.; due to that grudge, the accused murdered Saddam Khalid (the 
deceased).  
4. 
 
After the incident, the complainant reported the matter to the 
police through his oral complaint (Ex. PF), and after that, formal F.I.R 
(Exh.PF/1) was chalked out by Khan Muhammad A.S.I (PW-6). After the 
registration of the case, the investigation of this case was entrusted to Sajjad 
Hussain S.I/H.I.U (PW-11), who found the accused/appellant guilty, 
prepared a report under Section 173, Cr.P.C., and sent the same to the court 
of competent jurisdiction. On 16.10.2017, the trial court formally charge-
sheeted the appellant, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In 
support of its version, the prosecution produced as many as eleven (11) 
witnesses.  
5. 
 
Ocular account, in this case, has come out from the statements 
of Muhammad Khalid (PW-8)-the complainant, and Nadir Ali (PW-9)-the 
eye witness, whereas Dr. Mahmood Ali Raza (PW-4), who conducted the 
postmortem examination of Saddam Khalid (the deceased) found the 
following injuries on his person: 
INJURIES 
1) 
A stab wound measuring 1.5 x 1 cm on the left 
side of the front of the chest, 12 cm below the 
nipple, and 2 cm lateral to the sternum with 
corresponding holes on Kameez and Bunyan.  
2) 
A stab wound measuring 1.5 cm x 1 cm in the 
left loin region 10 cm above the iliac crest 
with corresponding holes in clothes.  
 
 
After conducting the postmortem examination, the doctor 
opined that the death was caused by hemorrhage and shock as a result of 
injuries No.1 & 2, which caused damage to the vital organs of the body; 
these injuries were grievous and sufficient to cause death in the ordinary 

Murder Reference No.164 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.193932 of 2018 & 
Crl. Appeal No.206624 of 2018

course of nature. All injuries were anti-mortem and enough to cause death 
by sharp-edged weapons. The probable time between injuries and death was 
half an hour, whereas between death and postmortem was about three hours.  
6. 
 
The learned Assistant District Public Prosecutor gave up PWs-
Arsalan, Ahmad Nawaz, Shah Nawaz 209/HC, and Muhammad Rafi, 
SI/HIU as being unnecessary and after tendering reports of Punjab Forensic 
Science Agency (Ex. PN and Ex. PO) closed the prosecution evidence. 
7. 
 
The appellant was also examined in terms of Section 342 
Cr.P.C., wherein he did not opt to appear as his own witness in terms of 
Section 340(2) Cr.P.C.; however, he produced Mark D.A to Mark D.D in his 
defence evidence. In response to a particular question about why this case 
was against him and why the PWs deposed against him, the appellant made 
the following deposition: - 
“This case was falsely registered against myself 
as well as against the co-accused persons. So far 
as the PWs are concerned they are related inter 
se, they hence deposed falsely against me. 
Infact, on the day of occurrence, Saddam 
Khalid deceased was playing Cricket with some 
youngsters in the play ground of village Basti 
Mai Roshan and during the said match a 
sudden fight erupted in between the two groups. 
Saddam Khalid deceased was hard headed, 
street criminal and he used to remain indulged 
in nefarious activities, so during the said open 
fight sustained injuries mysteriously by some 
unidentified culprits, but the complainant 
involved me in this case falsely after due 
deliberation and hectic consultation on account 
of party factions in the village. Even otherwise, 
I was present on my duty at southern railway 
crossing Bhakkar City as being railway 
employee at the time of alleged occurrence. 
Neither complainant nor alleged PWs witnessed 
the occurrence. Neither I nor my co-accused 
persons were present at the spot. Muhammad 
Khalid complainant was called from his house 
and he got registered this false case against me 
and other co-accused persons, after due 
deliberation and consultation and with padding.

I am innocent, I have been involved in this case 
merely on suspicion; I am a poor person and 
only bread earner of my whole family. I cannot 
even think to commit murder of my whole 
family. I have became pauper due to this false 
case.”      
 
8. 
 
After evaluating the evidence available on record in light of 
arguments advanced by both sides, the trial court found the prosecution 
version proved beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt, which resulted in 
the appellant’s conviction and sentence in the above terms.  
9. 
 
We have given our anxious and most thoughtful consideration 
to both sides’ rival submissions. We have minutely gone through the 
evidence on record.  
10. 
 
The incident took place on 15.07.2017 at 06:15 p.m. near 
Masjid Jafria situated in village Basti Mai Roshan, within the area of Police 
Station, Kallur Kot, District Bhakkar, which is at a distance of 25/26-
kilometers from the place of occurrence. Muhammad Khalid Khan (PW-8)-
the complainant reported the incident through oral complaint (Exh. PF) to 
Sajjad Hussain, S.I./H.I.U. (PW-11) at 07:45 p.m. at THQ Hospital, Kallur 
Kot, who reached the hospital upon receiving information of the incident 
and he (PW-11) incorporated police proceedings at the bottom of the oral 
complaint (Exh. PF) and referred the same through Ahmad Sher 412/C (not 
cited as PW) to the police station, based on which, formal F.I.R. (Exh. PF/1) 
was chalked out on the same day at 07:55 p.m. by Khan Muhammad A.S.I 
(PW-6). Muhammad Khalid Khan (PW-8)-the complainant, took one hour 
and forty minutes to report the incident to the police.  
11. 
 
As per the prosecution case, Saddam Khalid-the deceased (then 
injured), was taken to THQ Hospital, Kallur Kot, for treatment, and Saddam 
Khalid-the deceased (then injured) scummed to the injuries. The deposition 
of Dr. Mahmood Ali Raza (PW-4) reveals that the dead body of Saddam 
Khalid (the deceased) was produced before him on 15.07.2017 at 06:50 p.m. 
He (PW-4) deposed during cross-examination that:  

Murder Reference No.164 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.193932 of 2018 & 
Crl. Appeal No.206624 of 2018

“The dead body was produced before me at 
6.50 P.M on 15.07.2017. When the dead body 
was produced before me, I examined it and 
after examining I recorded the time of death in 
the relevant column as 6.53 P.M.” 
Muhammad Khalid Khan (PW-8)-the complainant deposed during cross-
examination that:  
“We almost consumed half an hour to reach in 
the hospital. When doctor reached to check the 
deceased Sadam Khalid, he after examining the 
injured informed us that he had expired. The 
deceased was un-conscious after receiving the 
injuries. The deceased at the spot was un-
conscious and he did not expire at the spot. We 
shifted the deceased from the place of 
occurrence in injured condition.” 
 
 
Sajjad Hussain S.I/H.I.U. (PW-11)-the investigating officer 
deposed during examination in chief that: - 
“On 15.07.2017 I was posted as SI/HIU circle 
Kallur Kot. On the same day, after receiving 
the information, regarding the occurrence, I 
reached at THQ Kallur Kot, where Muhammad 
Khalid Khan complainant of this case met me 
and I recorded his statement Exh.PF which is in 
my hand and bears my signatures. Exh.PF was 
read 
over 
to Muhammad 
Khalid 
Khan 
complainant and he signed the same as a token 
of correctness. I sent the complaint for 
registration of case through Ahmad Sher 
412/C.” 
 
 
 
 
 
The oral complaint (Exh.PF) shows that Muhammad Sajjad 
Hussain, S.I./H.I.U. (PW-11)-investigating officer incorporated police 
proceedings at the bottom of the oral complaint (Exh. PF) at 07:45 p.m. at 
THQ Hospital, Kallur Kot. He (PW-11)-the investigating officer referred the 
same through Ahmad Sher 412/C (not cited as PW) to the police station, 
based on which formal F.I.R. (Exh. PF/1) was chalked out on the same day 
at 07:55 p.m. by Khan Muhammad A.S.I (PW-6). Whereas, per the 
prosecution case, the incident occurred at 06:15 p.m. on 15.07.2017. Dr. 
Mahmood Ali Raza (PW-4) deposed that the dead body of Saddam Khalid

(the deceased) was produced before him on 15.07.2017 at 06:50 p.m. and in 
the column of post-mortem report (Exh. PC), he entered the time of death at 
06:53 p.m. Whereas Muhammad Sajjad Hussain, S.I./H.I.U. (PW-11)-
investigating officer deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“I do not remember the exact time when I 
received 
the 
information 
regarding 
the 
occurrence. I reached at THQ Kallur Kot at 
about 6.50 P.M. As soon as I reached in THQ 
Kallur Kot, I recorded the statement of 
complainant Muhammad Khalid Khan. Many 
persons were available with the complainant at 
that time, but I cannot tell as to whether the eye 
witnesses were present or not at that time 
Instead, the fact that Saddam Khalid (the deceased) expired due to injuries 
came to the surface at 6:53 p.m. on 15.07.2017. During cross-examination, 
Sajjad Hussain S.I/H.I.U. (PW-11)-the investigating officer deposed that: - 
“I consumed about 55 minutes in recording the 
statement of the complainant and preparing 
inquest report etc.” 
 
 
In view of the deposition of Sajjad Hussain S.I/H.I.U. (PW-11)-
the investigating officer, it reveals that he took 55 minutes to record the 
complainant’s statement, prepare the inquest report, etc. After the 
preparation of the inquest report, etc. (etc. was not explained), within 55 
minutes, he (PW-11)-the investigating officer, sent the oral complaint 
(Ex.PF) to the police station for the recording of FIR. It reveals that before 
the registration of the FIR, the investigating officer conducted a partial 
investigation. Admittedly, a statement under section 154 Cr.P.C. of 
Muhammad Khalid Khan (PW-8)-the complainant was not incorporated in 
the register for FIRs registration. Khan Muhammad A.S.I (PW-6) deposed 
during examination-in-chief that on receiving the oral complaint (Ex. PF), 
endorsed and dispatched by Sajjad Hussain SI/HIU (PW-11) through Ahmad 
Sher 412/C, he (PW-6) dictated the FIR (Exh.PF/1) to the Computer 
Operator, who typed it without any addition or deletion. The prosecution has 
not produced the Computer Operator to whom dictation was given by Khan 
Muhammad A.S.I. (PW-6), and he typed the FIR (Exh.PF/1). According to 

Murder Reference No.164 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.193932 of 2018 & 
Crl. Appeal No.206624 of 2018

Rule 24.5 of Police Rules 1934, the F.I.R. shall be filled in the printed Form 
in Form 24.5 (1) with pages serially numbered with three carbon copies 
(each of the four pages of the register bearing the same serial number) since 
the oral complaint (Ex.PF) was not recorded in the first information report 
register it throws doubt on the time of reporting the incident to the police. 
The copy of the FIR entered in the first information report register is not 
being exhibited by the prosecution. Whenever an information regarding 
cognizable offence is lodged with the police officer, he is obliged to take the 
same down in writing if it is made orally or receive the complaint in writing 
and straightaway proceed to enter the substance of it in the book/register 
kept for that purpose in terms of Section 154 of the Criminal Procedure 
Code. The First Information Report was not entered into the register, 
suggesting that F.I.R. (Exh.PF/1) was not chalked out as stated. The 
evidential value of the First Information Report will be reduced if it is made 
after the unexplained delay, particularly when the same was not entered in 
the printed Form 24.5 (1) of Police Rules 1934.  
12. 
 
The prosecution failed to prove the time and place where 
Saddam Khalid (the deceased) took his last breath. Reading together the 
above deposition of Dr. Mahmood Ali Raza (PW-4), Muhammad Khalid 
Khan (PW-8)-the complainant, and Sajjad Hussain SI/HIU (PW-11) first 
gave an impression that the first information report was promptly lodged, 
and the investigation commenced without delay. However, scrutiny of the 
depositions of the three witnesses above would reveal that the first 
information report was ante-timed, and the investigation was tainted, 
fictitious, and wholly unreliable. Police proceedings incorporated at the 
bottom of the oral complaint (Exh.PF) by Muhammad Sajjad Hussain, 
S.I./H.I.U. (PW-11)-investigating officer, reveals that Muhammad Sajjad 
Hussain, S.I./H.I.U. (PW-11)-investigating officer on receiving information 
reached the mortuary of THQ Hospital, Kallur Kot, where the dead body of 
Saddam Khalid (the deceased) was lying and Muhammad Khalid Khan 
(PW-8)-the complainant got recorded his oral complaint (Ex.PF). The dead 
body of Saddam Khalid (the deceased) was referred for postmortem

examination to THQ Hospital, Kallur Kot. Police proceedings incorporated 
at the bottom of the oral complaint (Exh. PF) by Muhammad Sajjad Hussain, 
S.I./H.I.U. (PW-11)-investigating officer read as under: -

On perusal of the inquest report (Exh.PE), in column No.24, it was 
mentioned that the dead body was lying in the mortuary. This creates doubt 
about the testimonies of Dr. Mahmood Ali Raza (PW-4), Muhammad Khalid 
(PW-8)-the 
complainant, 
Sajjad 
Hussain 
S.I/H.I.U. 
(PW-11)-the 
investigating officer, and Falak Sher 767/C (PW-3), about the time when 
Saddam Khalid, the deceased, succumbed to the injuries, brought to the 
hospital. After that, the dead body was sent to the mortuary. So, the dead 
body of Saddam Khalid (the deceased) was produced before Dr. Mahmood 
Ali Raza (PW-4) by Falak Sher 767/C (PW-3) on 15.07.2017 at 06:50 p.m. 
At the cost of repetition, we have reproduced the relevant part of the 
deposition of Dr. Mahmood Ali Raza (PW-4), which reads as under:  
“The dead body was produced before me at 
6.50 P.M on 15.07.2017. When the dead body 
was produced before me, I examined it and 

Murder Reference No.164 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.193932 of 2018 & 
Crl. Appeal No.206624 of 2018 
 
 
 
 
10
after examining I recorded the time of death in 
the relevant column as 6.53 P.M.” 
The only document, Dr. Mahmood Ali Raza (PW-4) prepared was the post-
mortem report (Ex.PC). At the same time, he conducted a post-mortem 
examination of the dead body of Saddam Khalid-the deceased, at 10:00 p.m. 
on 15.07.2017. Sajjad Hussain S.I/H.I.U. (PW-11)-the investigating officer 
admitted that on receiving information about the incident, he (PW-11) 
reached THQ Hospital, Kallur Kot, at 06:55 p.m. Besides, in column No.3 of 
the inquest report (Ex. PE), the date and time of receiving information about 
the death was mentioned as “15.07.2017 at 06:55 p.m.” and in column No.2 
relating to the distance between the police station and the place where the 
death took place or where the dead body was recovered, was mentioned as 
“01-kilometer”. Sajjad Hussain S.I/H.I.U. (PW-11)-the investigating officer 
deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“THQ Kallor Kot is at a distance of about one 
km towards south west direction from the 
building of P.S. Kallur Kot. Place of occurrence 
is at a distance of 25/26 kms from P.S. Kallur 
Kot.”  
Muhammad Khalid Khan (PW-8)-the complainant deposed during 
examination-in-chief that he (PW-8), Muhammad Arslan (given up PW), 
and Nadir Ali (PW-9) brought Sadam Khalid in injured condition to THQ 
Hospital Kallur Kot, where he succumbed to the injuries. In similar lines, 
Nadir Ali (PW-9)-the eyewitness, stated. Admittedly, Saddam Khalid-the 
deceased (then injured), was accompanied by Muhammad Khalid Khan 
(PW-8)-the complainant, Nadir Ali (PW-9)-the eye witness, and Muhammad 
Arslan (given up PW) to THQ Hospital Kallur Kot, and none of them 
reported the incident to the police, whereas the police station was at a 
distance of 01-kilometer from THQ Hospital, Kallur Kot. The matter 
remained shrouded in mystery about who informed the police about the 
incident. Sajjad Hussain S.I/H.I.U. (PW-11)-the investigating officer stated 
that he reached THQ Hospital, Kallur Kot, on receiving information about 
the incident at 06:55 p.m. Sajjad Hussain S.I/H.I.U (PW-11)-the 
investigating officer deposed during cross-examination that:- 

Murder Reference No.164 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.193932 of 2018 & 
Crl. Appeal No.206624 of 2018

“I do not remember the exact time when I 
received 
the 
information 
regarding 
the 
occurrence. I reached at THQ Kallur Kot at 
about 6.50 P.M. As soon as I reached in THQ 
Kallur Kot, I recorded the statement of 
complainant Muhammad Khalid Khan. Many 
persons were available with the complainant at 
that time, but I cannot tell as to whether the eye 
witnesses were present or not at that time. 
Complainant did not point out about the 
presence of eye witnesses in THQ Kallur Kot. 
Had the eye witnesses met me at that time, then 
I would have recorded their statements u/s 161 
Cr.P.C.” 
The inquest report (Ex.PE) also revealed that any eyewitness or complainant 
did not sign the same. We have noted that the contents of F.I.R. (Ex.PF/1) 
were re-produced ad verbatim in the inquest report (Ex.PE). Muhammad 
Khalid Khan (PW-8)-the complainant, deposed during cross-examination 
that: - 
“We did not inform the police while shifting the 
deceased from the place of occurrence in the 
hospital. Police reached in the THQ hospital 
Kallur Kot after 5/10 minutes of our reaching in 
the hospital.” 
Nadir Ali (PW-9)-the eye witness deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“We did not call police, i.e. at 15 or Rescue 
1122. We did not approach to police at Police 
chowki Maibal Sharif, volunteered that as the 
injured was in serious condition, so our first 
target was to save his life.”  
 
 
 
In the instant case, the prosecution has not given a reason for 
the delay in lodging the first information report (Exh.PF/1). The deposition 
of Sajjad Hussain S.I/H.I.U. (PW-11)-the investigating officer doubts the 
presence of witnesses, i.e., Nadir Ali (PW-9) and Muhammad Arslan (given 
up PW) at THQ Hospital, Kallur Kot. At the same time, the prosecution 
witnesses were not present at THQ Hospital, Kallur Kot. Sajjad Hussain 
S.I/H.I.U (PW-11)-the investigating officer deposed in his examination-in-
chief that after referring the oral complaint (Exh.PF) to police station

through Ahmad Sher 412/C for registration of formal FIR, he (PW-11) 
prepared injury statement (Exh.DD) and inquest report (Exh.PE) of Saddam 
Khalid-the deceased. Then he handed over the dead body for post-mortem 
examination to Falak Sher 767/C (PW-3). Falak Sher 767/C (PW-3) deposed 
in his examination-in-chief that the dead body was handed over to him by 
Sajjad Hussain S.I/H.I.U. (PW-11)-the investigating officer for postmortem 
examination. He (PW-3) did not state a single word about wherefrom the 
dead body was handed over to him. Rather, he (PW-3) had deposed during 
cross-examination that they reached THQ Hospital at 07:00 p.m. and at 8:30 
p.m./9:00 p.m. post-mortem examination started. Dr. Mahmood Ali Raza 
(PW-4) deposed during examination-in-chief that: - 
“The post mortem was conducted at 10.00 P.M, 
and according to the information given by the 
police injuries were caused by knife.” 
 
 
 
All this leads us to look into the medical evidence brought on 
the record by the prosecution through Dr. Mahmood Ali Raza (PW-4) and 
the postmortem report (Exh.PC). On external examination, Dr. Mahmood 
Ali Raza (PW-4) observed that rigor mortis was developed, and this fact is 
also mentioned in the postmortem report (Exh. PC). Dr. Mahmood Ali Raza 
(PW-4) deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“The rigor mortus process almost starts in 
acute summer season within about 2.30/3 
hours.” 
 
 
 
The doctor opined that there is probably three hours lapse 
between death and postmortem. If the incident occurred at the time as 
alleged by the prosecution witnesses and Saddam Khalid-the deceased, 
expired between 6:50 p.m. and 07:00 p.m., possibility of rigor mortis on the 
dead body of the deceased would not be present. The inquest report (Ex. PE) 
also showed that the complainant or any eyewitnesses did not sign the same. 
Although Nadir Khan (PW-9) had deposed during examination-in-chief that 
he, along with Muhamad Khalid Khan (PW-8) and Muhammad Arsalan 
(given up PW), took Saddam Khalid-the deceased, to THQ Hospital Kallur 

Murder Reference No.164 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.193932 of 2018 & 
Crl. Appeal No.206624 of 2018 
 
 
 
 
13
Kot. During cross-examination, he stated that Doctor informed them that 
Saddam Khalid-the deceased, had expired. If Sajjad Hussain S.I/H.I.U. (PW-
11)-the investigating officer reached THQ Hospital Kallur Kot at 06:50 p.m. 
then should have met with Nadir Khan (PW-9) or if Nadir Khan (PW-9) was 
present at the time of arrival of Sajjad Hussain S.I/H.I.U. (PW-11)-the 
investigating officer, his name and signatures should be available on the 
inquest report (Ex.PE). All the above facts throw a cloud of doubt and reveal 
that the prosecution took time to manage the witnesses. The absence of 
details in the inquest report may be indicative of the fact that the prosecution 
story was still rudimentary and had not been given any shape and that the 
FIR came to be recorded later on after due deliberations and consultation 
and was then ante-timed to provide it with a color of promptly lodged FIR. 
Whether FIR was registered at the time as stated or not? The same could be 
checked from an external check; equally important is sending the copy of the 
FIR along with the dead body and its reference in the inquest report. Even 
though the inquest report, prepared under Section 174 Cr.P.C., is aimed at 
serving a statutory function to lend credence to the prosecution case, the 
details of the FIR and the gist of statements recorded during inquest 
proceedings get reflected in the report. The absence of those details is 
indicative of the fact that the prosecution story was still in a rudimentary 
state and had not been given any shape and that the FIR came to be recorded 
later on after due deliberations and consultations and was then ante-time to 
give it the color of a promptly lodged FIR. It gets support from the recovery 
memo of last worn clothes (Ex.PB), recovery memo of blood-stained earth 
(Ex.PI), and un-scaled site plan (Ex.PK), from which it reveals that after 
writing “بنام” space was left blank. This suggests that until receiving the 
deceased's last worn clothes by Sajjad Hussain S.I/H.I.U. (PW-11)-the 
investigating officer, the FIR was not in existence, the Roznamcha was 
withheld, and ante-timed FIR was registered. Dr. Mahmood Ali Raza (PW-
4) deposed that post-mortem examination of the dead body was conducted at 
10:00 p.m. on 15.07.2017. FIR (Ex. PF/1) was chalked out at 07:55 p.m., but 
the same was not produced before him (PW-4). Dr. Mahmood Ali Raza 
(PW-4) deposed during examination-in-chief that: -   

Murder Reference No.164 of 2018,

“Ex.PC is the correct carbon copy of the 
postmortem report, which is in my hand and 
bears my signatures. I also prepared the 
pictorial diagram Exh.PC/1, besides that I 
signed the injury statement Exh.PD and inquest 
report Exh.PE.” 
 
 
 In our opinion, on account of the infirmities, as noticed above, 
the FIR has lost its value and authenticity. It appears to us that the same has 
been ante-timed and had not been recorded till the post-mortem examination 
of the dead body was over, and handing over the last worn clothes of the 
deceased to Sajjad Hussain S.I/H.I.U. (PW-11)-the investigating officer.  
13. 
 
Besides, we have also noted that the prosecution witnesses, i.e., 
Muhamad Khalid Khan (PW-8) and Nadir Khan (PW-9), stated that due to 
the severe condition of Saddam Khalid-the deceased, then injured, was taken 
to the THQ Hospital. The presence of these witnesses was alleged to be 
doubtful at the spot because if they had been present and witnessed the 
occurrence, they would have tried to stop the blood oozing from the body of 
the son of Muhamad Khalid Khan (PW-8). Still, on the contrary, they did 
not provide the first aid. Muhammad Khalid (PW-8)-the complainant 
deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“We did not attempt to stop oozing of blood.” 
 
 
Similarly, Nadir Ali (PW-9)-the eye-witnessed deposed during 
cross-examination that: - 
“The blood was oozing profusely from the 
wounds of the deceased. We did not make any 
bandage around the wounds of the deceased.” 
Dr. Mahmood Ali Raza (PW-4) deposed during cross-examination that: -  
“As I have mentioned the probable duration 
between injury and death about half an hour, so 
it can be said that he remained alive for 
maximum period of half an hour.” 
Muhammad Khalid (PW-8)-the complainant, deposed during cross-
examination that different hospitals and medical centers were available from

the place of occurrence to THQ Hospital Kallur Kot. Muhammad Khalid 
(PW-8)-the complainant deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“The place of occurrence is at a distance of half 
farlang towards west of main Bhakkar, Kallur 
Kot road. From the main Bhakkar Kallur Kot 
road another link pakka road leads towards the 
place of occurrence, but just for about 100 feet. 
There is only one path from the place of 
occurrence to reach at the main road near 
telephone exchange. From that exchange, there 
is a hospital of Basti Mai Roshan towards north 
at a distance of half farlang. Whereas the said 
hospital is adjacent to the main Bhakkar, 
Kallur Kot road. From village Basti Mai 
Roshan, the village Shah Alam is towards north 
at a distance of 2/2-1/2 kms, the said village is 
called Shah Alam ADA. From Shah Alam, 
maibal city is towards north at a distance of 
about 5 kms. The hospital is also available in 
Maibal city adjacent to Bhakkar, Kallur Kot 
road. Police post maibal sharif is situated at a 
distance of about 250/300 karmas from maibal 
hospital towards north-west. THQ hospital is 
situated at a distance of 12/14 kms from Maibal 
Sharif on the same road. Bhakkar, Kallur Kot 
road connects with Sargodha road which leads 
to Chandni Chowk, Chandni Chowk is situated 
towards east from Kallur Kot. Building of P.S 
Kallur Kot is exists on Kallur Kot Sargodha 
Road. P.S. Kallur Kot is situated at a distance 
of ½ km towards north east direction from 
THQ Kallur Kot. THQ Kallur Kot is situated at 
a distance of 22/23 kms from the place of 
occurrence, while building of P.S Kallur Kot is 
situated about 24/25 kms from the place of 
occurrence. While moving from the place of 
occurrence towards THQ Kallur Kot, hospital 
of Basti Mai Roshan, Shah Alam ADA, civil 
hospital Maibal Sharif, police post maibal 
Sharif & Maibal city comes on the way. I did 
not informed the police chowki maibal and also 
did not escort the then injured to hospitals of 
Basti Mai Roshan & Maibal Sharif, volunteered 
that as the then injured was in very serious 
condition and we were struggling to save his 
life, so apparently we did not approach the said 
hospitals or chowki maibal.”

Nadir Ali (PW-9)-the eye witness deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“The deceased was in un-conscious condition, 
we were not confirmed at that time as to 
whether the deceased has died or alive. We did 
not approach the hospitals of the Basti Mai 
Roshan & Mebal for first aid, volunteered that 
these hospitals are small and injured was in 
serious condition, due to this reason we brought 
him in THQ Kallur Kot. -------------- We did not 
approach to police at Police chowki Maibal 
Sharif, volunteered that as the injured was in 
serious condition, so our first target was to save 
his life.----------------THQ hospital is at a 
distance of 20/21 kms from the place of 
occurrence towards north. We reached in THQ 
Kallur Kot after 25/30 minutes of the 
occurrence. It was not in our knowledge, that 
when we reached in THQ Kallur Kot, injured 
was alive or dead. When we reached THQ 
Kallur 
Kot, 
the 
doctor 
came 
there 
immediately.”  
 
 
Both witnesses admitted that different hospitals were available 
on the way from the place of occurrence to THQ Hospital, Kallur Kot. Still, 
they did not take Saddam Khalid-the deceased (then injured), to any nearby 
hospital for providing medical treatment. Both the witnesses, i.e., 
Muhammad Khalid (PW-8)-the complainant, and Nadir Ali (PW-9)-the eye 
witness, admitted during cross-examination that they took him to THQ 
Hospital, Kallur Kot, due to the severe condition of Saddam Khalid-the 
deceased. The act of the prosecution witnesses, i.e., Muhammad Khalid 
(PW-8)-the complainant, and Nadir Ali (PW-9)-the eye witness, remained 
unnatural. They did not try to stop the profusely oozing of blood from the 
deceased’s wounds, nor they took him to any nearby hospital to provide him 
first aid to save his life. Instead, they opted to take him to the hospital, which 
was far from the place of occurrence at a distance of 25/26 kilometers, 
which also threw a cloud of doubt on the presence of both witnesses, 
including the complainant.  
14. 
 
We have noted that the star witnesses, Muhammad Khalid 
(PW-8)-the complainant, and Nadir Ali (PW-9)-the eye witness, have

brought on record a somewhat different story about blood-stained clothes 
and hands, which conflicts with the evidence of Sajjad Hussain S.I/H.I.U. 
(PW-11)-the 
investigating 
officer. 
Muhammad 
Khalid 
(PW-8)-the 
complainant deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“We did not chase the accused persons, as we 
attended the deceased; soon after falling after 
receiving the knife blows, our clothes were 
stained with blood. We did not sustain any 
injury during the occurrence. ---------------- We 
consumed 2/, 2/1/2 minutes at the place of 
occurrence. We shifted the injured to hospital 
in the Car. The seats of Car were also smeared 
with blood. Arslan and Nadir PWs also 
accompanied with me towards the hospital. -----
------------We all the three persons showed our 
blood stained clothes to the police at THQ 
Kallur Kot, however, police did not take into 
possession our said blood stained clothes. I had 
then informed the police that Nadir and Arslan 
PWs are eyewitnesses of the occurrence. ---------
------The I.O did not collect our blood stained 
clothes at the place of occurrence.” 
Nadir Ali (PW-9)-the eye witness deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“We had attended the then injured at the place 
of occurrence. Our hands and clothes were 
smeared with blood. Only clothes of the 
Muhammad Khalid (complainant) and myself 
were smeared with blood. The seats of the car 
were also smeared with blood. We told the I.O 
that we are the eye witnesses of the occurrence. 
we had shown our blood stained hands to the 
I.O, we also had shown our blood stained 
clothes to the I.O, but he did not take the same 
into possession.” 
Contrary to the depositions of Muhammad Khalid (PW-8)-the complainant, 
and Nadir Ali (PW-9)-the eyewitnesses, Sajjad Hussain S.I/H.I.U. (PW-11)-
the investigating officer deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“I did not notice that as to whether at that time 
hands and clothes of the complainant were 
smeared with blood or not. The complainant 
did not show me his blood stained hands and 

Murder Reference No.164 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.193932 of 2018 & 
Crl. Appeal No.206624 of 2018 
 
 
 
 
18
clothes at that time. Had the complainant 
showed me his blood stained clothes, I would 
have taken into possession the same. It is 
incumbent upon the I.O to collect the entire 
relevant 
evidence 
which 
relates 
to 
the 
occurrence. If the blood stained clothes of the 
any witness are stained with blood, then it is the 
obligation of I.O to take it into possession as 
relevant evidence.” 
 
 
There is a conflict between the statements of Muhammad 
Khalid (PW-8)-the complainant, and Nadir Ali (PW-9)-the eyewitness, with 
the testimony of Sajjad Hussain S.I/H.I.U. (PW-11)-the investigating officer, 
which also creates doubt about the presence of both the witnesses at the 
place of occurrence.  
15. 
 
On the point of prosecution witnesses, i.e., Muhammad Khalid 
(PW-8)-the complainant, and Nadir Ali (PW-9), they are chance and 
interested witnesses. In the totality of the infirmities pointed out above, the 
presence of Muhammad Khalid (PW-8)-the complainant, and Nadir Ali 
(PW-9) becomes doubtful. Admittedly, Saddam Khalid-the deceased, was 
the son of Muhammad Khalid (PW-8)-the complainant, and Nadir Ali (PW-
9)-the eye witness, is the son of Haseena Bibi, who is the paternal cousin of 
the complainant’s wife and Muhammad Arslan is the son of the sister of 
complainant’s wife, namely Parveen Bibi. Muhammad Khalid (PW-8)-the 
complainant deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“The house of Nadir Ali pw is located on the 
northern side at about 200/250 karmas from the 
place of occurrence. our house is also located at 
about 200 karmas towards north of the place of 
occurrence, whereas the house of Arslan pw is 
located at about 10 karmas towards west north 
of the place of occurrence. Arslan PW works 
alongwith his father in their business of cattles 
and sometimes he also drives vehicles.-------------
-The place of occurrence is at a distance of half 
farlang towards west of main Bhakkar, Kallur 
Kot road. From main Bhakkar Kallur Kot road 
another link pakka road leads towards the 
place of occurrence, but just for about 100 
feet.”

19
Contrary to the deposition of Muhammad Khalid (PW-8)-the complainant 
about the presence of the deceased, Nadir Ali (PW-9)-the eye witness 
deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“It is correct that my mother is Phophi Zaad of 
the deceased. My house is situated at a distance 
of 5/5-1/2 acres towards north from the place of 
occurrence. The house of complainant is 
towards south from my house at a distance of 
1/1/2/2 acres. The house of Arslan pw is situated 
at a distance of 6/7 acres from my house 
towards south.” 
There is no dispute over the fact that from the main Bhakkar Kallur Kot 
Road, another link, pakka road, leads towards the place of occurrence. The 
way through which one could reach the place of occurrence was not the only 
way. It is settled law that the evidence of a witness cannot be discarded only 
on the ground that he is a related witness. But it is only the rule of prudence, 
the rule of caution, that evidence of such witness is scrutinized with some 
extra caution. Once the Court is satisfied that the witness was present at the 
scene of occurrence and his evidence inspires confidence, the same cannot 
be discarded on the sole ground of relationship with the deceased or chance 
witness. Muhammad Khalid (PW-8)-the complainant further deposed during 
cross-examination that: - 
“We were standing at a distance of 50 feet from 
Jafaria mosque towards south. I did not 
mention the reason of our presence at that place 
in my statement before the police.” 
 
 
Heinous cases, like murders, are not committed with previous 
notice to witnesses, soliciting their presence. If murder is a committed at a 
thoroughfare, the presence of witnesses having a relation with the deceased 
would be considered chance witnesses; if the incident took place in the 
house, the inmates of the house are natural witnesses. If murder is 
committed in the street or thoroughfare, only passersby will be witnesses. 
The place of occurrence was thoroughfare and the prosecution witnesses i.e. 
Muhammad Khalid Khan (PW-8)-the complainant and Nadir Ali (PW-9) 
have not got any reason to be present at the place of occurrence at the time 

Murder Reference No.164 of 2018,

Crl. Appeal No.206624 of 2018

of its taking place. Muhammad Khalid (PW-8)-the complainant further 
deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“Cattle shed from where the Saddam Khalid 
deceased was coming was located towards north 
from the place where we were standing, the said 
cattle shed is situated at a distance of about 
20/25 karams from the place where we were 
standing. Whereas the accused came from 
eastern side from the place where we were 
standing.” 
Nadir Ali (PW-9)-the eye witness deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“The cattle shed of Nasir Hussain is situated at 
a distance of 100 feet towards north from the 
place where we were standing. The cattle shed 
is at a distance of about 150 feet towards north 
west from the place of occurrence. There is 
abadi of two sides of the place of occurrence. 
There are residential houses of people of the 
vicinity from two sides. Accused persons 
suddenly appeared there. They came from 
eastern side. We were jointly present at the 
spot. Deceased was present at a distance of 50 
feet towards south east from us at the time of 
occurrence. Prior to the arrival of the accused 
persons suddenly at the spot, we did not see 
them prior to reaching at the spot. We did not 
see Sadam Khalid, when he was coming from 
cattle shed/Warra, volunteered that deceased 
crossed us.” 
Whereas Sajjad Hussain S.I/H.I.U. (PW-11)-the investigating officer, 
deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“Cattle shed of Nasir Hussain is situated at a 
distance of about 300 feet towards north from 
the place of occurrence. I did not show said 
cattle 
shed 
in 
my 
un-scaled 
site 
plan. 
Complainant and witnesses did not point out 
the said cattle shed.” 
 
 
Sajjad Hussain S.I/H.I.U. (PW-11)-the investigating officer also 
deposed during cross-examination that eyewitnesses told him they had 
witnessed the occurrence from a distance of 50 feet. The presence of 

Murder Reference No.164 of 2018,

Crl. Appeal No.206624 of 2018 
 
 
 
 
21
Muhammad Khalid (PW-8)-the complainant, and Nadir Ali (PW-9)-the eye 
witness at the relevant time of occurrence, is belied from the site plan 
prepared on their pointing. The un-scaled site plan (Ex.PK) and scaled site 
plans (Ex.PA and Ex.PA/1) show the presence of witnesses at the height in 
the Northwestern near the Jafaria mosque at a distance of 50 feet, and the 
accused and deceased were in the southeast across the steep road. Hence, 
they cannot witness the incident. Whereas during the cross-examination 
Muhammad Khalid (PW-8)-the complainant, and Nadir Ali (PW-9)-the eye 
witness, improved their statements by stating that they were at 7 feet when a 
knife blow was given by accused Ali Ahsan alias Sunny. But the position of 
Muhammad Khalid (PW-8)-the complainant, and Nadir Ali (PW-9)-the eye 
witness near the deceased, was not shown in the un-scaled site plan (Ex. PK) 
and scaled site plans (Ex. PA and Ex. PA/1). Although the site plan is not a 
substantive piece of evidence in Article 22 of the Qanune-e-Shahdat Order 
1984 as held in the case of Mst. Shamim Akhtar v. Fiaz Akhter and two 
others (PLD 1992 SC 211), but it reflects the view of the crime scene, and 
the same can be used to contradict or disbelieve eyewitnesses. All these 
circumstances make the presence of the eyewitnesses, i.e., Muhammad 
Khalid (PW-8)-the complainant, and Nadir Ali (PW-9), at the spot doubtful.  
16. 
 
Regarding motive, it is a double-edged sword that cuts both 
sides/ways. In the instant case, the prosecution, to establish the motive part 
of the incident, produced Muhammad Khalid Khan (PW-8)-the complainant, 
who deposed in his examination in chief that: - 
“Motive behind the occurrence was that two 
days before the occurrence, an altercation took 
place between Sadam Khalid and Ali Ahsan 
alias Sunny and other accused persons, so due 
to this reason, they committed murder of my 
deceased son Sadam Khalid.” 
Similarly, Nadir Ali (PW-9)-the complainant, deposed. Whereas, during 
cross-examination, Muhammad Khalid (PW-8)-the complainant, deposed 
that: - 
“I have disclosed the motive part of this 
occurrence before the police. I had not 

Murder Reference No.164 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.193932 of 2018 & 
Crl. Appeal No.206624 of 2018 
 
 
 
 
22
mentioned the detail of said motive part of 
occurrence, i.e., place, time & Pws of the said 
altercation. I had not disclosed the reason for 
said altercation of motive part off occurrence to 
the police. I had not informed the police in any 
way about the said altercation. I had not 
produced any witness 
before 
the 
police 
regarding the motive part of the occurrence.” 
The defence brought improvement in the deposition of Nadir Ali (PW-9)-the 
eye witness. Nadir Ali (PW-9)-the eye witness deposed during cross-
examination that:- 
“My statement was recorded by the I.O in this 
case. I had not got recorded in my statement 
before the I.O that two days prior to this 
occurrence an altercation took place in between 
the accused Ali Ahsan etc and Sadam Khalid 
deceased.” 
Sajjad Hussain S.I/H.I.U. (PW-11)-the investigating officer deposed during 
cross-examination that: - 
“I correctly recorded the statement of Nadir Ali 
without any addition, deletion or omission. Both 
eye witnesses namely Nadir Ali and Arslan did 
not describe about the motive of this occurrence 
in their statements.”  
 
 
The motive is a double-edged weapon that cuts both ways. If, 
on the one hand, it provided a reason for the accused to commit the 
occurrence in question, on the other hand, it equally provided to the first 
informant to implicate his rival. The motive for the commission of the crime 
by the accused was not proved through cogent and convincing evidence.  
17. 
 
So far as recovery of the weapon of offence, i.e., knife (P-4) 
from the possession of the accused/appellant and positive report of Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency (Ex. PO) regarding the presence of human blood 
on the blade of a knife, is concerned, as per the prosecution case, on 
16.08.2017, the accused was arrested. On 21.08.2017, upon his disclosure, a 
knife (P-4) was recovered from the northern room of his residential house. 
As per the recovery memo (Ex.PJ) knife (P-4) was kept in a cloth bag, which 
was hung on the room's western wall. Sajjad Hussain S.I/H.I.U. (PW-11)-the 

Murder Reference No.164 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.193932 of 2018 & 
Crl. Appeal No.206624 of 2018 
 
 
 
 
23
investigating officer deposed during examination-in-chief that after 
proceedings at the place of occurrence, he raided the houses of the accused 
persons, but they were not traceable. He (PW-11)-the investigating officer, 
further deposed that he raided the houses of the accused persons on various 
dates, but they were not traceable. It is astonishing that soon after the 
incident, the accused persons escaped from the place of occurrence, as per 
the prosecution case, and Sajjad Hussain S.I/H.I.U. (PW-11)-the 
investigating officer made efforts to effect the arrest. Even otherwise, it does 
not appeal to reason that the accused, Ali Ahsan alias Sunny might have kept 
a knife (P-4) in his house intact to produce it before the Investigating Officer 
on his arrest. The accused, Ali Ahsan alias Sunny, cannot be expected to 
keep the Knife (P-4) in his house when he could have easily disposed of the 
same. Reliance is placed on the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the case of “Bashir Ahmed alias Mannu  v. The State” (NLR 
1996 Criminal 234), wherein the learned Apex Court had disbelieved the 
prosecution evidence on this count. Besides, during cross-examination, 
Sajjad Hussain S.I/H.I.U. (PW-11)-the investigating officer admitted that: - 
“I recorded the statement of Shah Nawaz 
209/HC and Akhtar Iqbal 793/C correctly. 
Above said witnesses did not mention in their 
statements that knife was blood stained. I did 
not mention in the recovery memo of knife that 
the 
said 
knife 
P.4 
was 
blood 
stained, 
volunteered that it was blood stained, however, 
I could not mention as blood stained in the 
recovery memo.” 
 
 
It was not mentioned in the recovery memo (Ex. PJ) that the 
knife was blood stained. Akhtar Iqbal 793/C (PW-10) deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“My statement was recorded by the I.O after 10 
A.M. I got recorded in my statement that 
recovered 
knife 
P.4 
was 
blood 
stained. 
Confronted with Exh. D.B wherein it is not so 
recorded.” 
 
 
In these circumstances, the recovery of the weapon of offence 
and a positive report are not of any consequence.

As it is difficult to rely upon the testimonies of Muhammad 
Khalid (PW-8)-the complainant, and Nadir Ali (PW-9)-the eye witness, and 
for other reasons enumerated hereinbefore, we are persuaded to hold that the 
prosecution had not been able to prove its case against the appellant beyond 
any shadow of a doubt as there were many dents in the prosecution story.  
The conviction and sentence the learned trial court recorded could not be 
sustained. It is held in the case of “Muhammad Akram v. The State” 
(2009 SCMR 230) that: - 
“It is an axiomatic principle of law that in case 
of doubt, the benefit thereof must accrue in 
favour of the accused as matter of right and not 
of grace. It was observed by this Court in the 
case of “Tariq Pervez v. The State” (1995 
SCMR 1345) that for giving the benefit of 
doubt, it was not necessary that there should be 
many circumstances creating doubts. If there is 
circumstance which created reasonable doubt 
in a prudent mind about the guilt of the 
accused, then the accused would be entitled to 
the benefit of doubt not as a matter of grace and 
concession but as a matter of right.”

The upshot of the above discussion is that the prosecution had 
severely failed to bring home a charge against the appellant beyond any 
reasonable doubt; therefore, in the interest of the safe administration of 
Criminal Justice, Crl. Appeal No.193932 of 2018, filed by Ali Ahsan alias 
Sunny, the appellant, is accepted in toto. The sentence awarded by the 
learned Additional Sessions Judge, Kallur Kot, vide judgment dated 
30.03.2018, is set aside. The appellant is acquitted of the charge in case FIR 
No.227/2017 dated 15.07.2017, registered under sections 302/34 PPC, at 
P.S. Kallur Kot, District Bhakkar. The appellant-Ali Ahsan alias Sunny, son 
of Anwar Hussain, is ordered to be released forthwith, if not required in any 
other case.

Murder Reference No.164 of 2018, forwarded by the learned 
trial court for confirmation of the sentence of death inflicted upon the 
convict fails, which is answered in Negative.

So far as CRIMINAL APPEAL No.206624 of 2018 seeking 
the conviction of respondent No.2-Touseef is concerned, we have noted that 
no role has been assigned to the respondent No.2-Touseef, and no injury was 
attributed to him towards the deceased or prosecution witnesses.  For what 
has been discussed above in the light of prosecution, medical, and 
documentary evidence, the acquittal of respondent No.2-Touseef does not 
suffer from any illegality to call for our interference with the impugned 
judgment to his extent. We have also taken note of the settled principle of 
criminal jurisprudence that unless it can be shown that the lower court’s 
judgment is perverse or that it is entirely illegal. No other conclusion can be 
drawn except the guilt of the accused or misreading or non-reading of 
evidence resulting in a miscarriage of justice. Even otherwise, when a court 
of competent jurisdiction acquits the accused, the double presumption of 
innocence is attached to his case.  The acquittal order cannot be interfered 
with, whereby a charge earns double presumption of innocence as held in 
Muhammad Mansha Kausar v. Muhammad Ashgar and others (2003 
SCMR 477).  In this case, the prosecution has not been able to bring on 
record adequate incriminating evidence against respondent No.2, which 
connects him with the alleged crime.  The learned trial Judge has advanced 
valid and plausible reasons for recording acquittal in favor of respondent 
No.2. The judgment of acquittal does not call for any interference. 
Consequently, we find no merit in this Criminal Appeal bearing 
No.206624 of 2018, which is, as a result of this, dismissed as being without 
prices.
