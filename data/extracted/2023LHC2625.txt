Mr. Azhar Iqbal, Advocate for the appellant.  
Malik Sarood Ahmad, A.A.G. on Court’s call. 
 
 
Appellant has directed this Intra Court 
Appeal under Section 3 of Law Reforms 
Ordinance, 1972 (Ordinance) against the order of 
learned 
Single 
Judge 
in 
Chamber 
dated 
18.04.2023, 
whereby 
his 
Writ 
Petition 
No.26551/2023 seeking annulment of order of 
Area Magistrate, Daska dated 18.04.2023 was 
dismissed. 
2. 
Precisely, the facts of the case are that the 
appellant, being accused in case FIR No.398/23 
dated 26.03.2023, in respect of offence under 
Section 337-A(i), 337-A(iii), 337-F(i), 337-L(ii), 
342, 148 & 149 PPC registered at Police Station, 
Motra District Sialkot filed an application for 
constitution of District Standing Medical Board 
before the Area Magistrate, Daska for re-
examination of injured Muhammad Shoaib and 
Shoaib Ali sons of Ghulam Hussain, which was 
dismissed by the said Court vide order dated 
11.04.2023. Legality of said order was questioned 
by 
the 
appellant 
by 
filing 
Writ 
Petition 
No.26551/2023 before this Court, which was 
dismissed by the learned Single Judge in Chamber 

                                        ICA No.28717/2023 
   
 
 
                                2     
 
vide impugned order dated 18.04.2023.  Hence, 
this appeal.  
3. 
At the very outset, in response to our query, 
qua maintainability of instant Intra Court Appeal, 
learned counsel while referring to reported 
judgment of Division Bench of this Court titled 
“Ahmad Khan ..Vs.. Addl. Sessions Judge, 
Talagang and 4 others (PLD 2020 Lahore 77)”, 
submits that the impugned order of Area 
Magistrate was an administrative order, which was 
not amenable to the Revisional jurisdiction, as 
such an aggrieved party has to question its validity 
in writ petition directly, against which Intra Court 
Appeal is proceedable. On the contrary, learned 
Law Officer while referring to proviso to 
subsection (2) of Section 3 of the Ordinance, 
submits that this appeal is not maintainable.  
4. 
Heard. In order to resolve controversy, 
proviso to subsection (2) of Section 3 of the 
Ordinance is of pivotal importance, which reads as 
under:- 
“Provided that the appeal referred to in this sub-
section shall not be available or competent if the application 
brought before the High Court under Article 199 arises out of 
any proceedings in which the law applicable provided for at 
least one appeal [or one revision or one review] to any court, 
tribunal or authority against the original order.”   
Bare reading of the aforesaid proviso makes 
it abundantly clear that an appeal under Section 3 
is not competent before the Division Bench of this 
Court, against the order of learned Single Judge 
passed in a writ petition under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, 
arises out of the proceedings, which at least 
provided one appeal, one revision or review to any 

                                        ICA No.28717/2023 
   
 
 
                                3     
 
Court, Tribunal or authority against the “original 
order”. The word “original order” contained in the 
above proviso has been interpreted by the Apex 
Court in case reported as “Muhammad Aslam 
Sukhera 
and 
others 
..Vs.. 
Collector 
Land 
Acquisition, Lahore, Improvement Trust, Lahore 
and another (PLD 2005 SC 45)”, wherein it has 
been laid down as under:- 
      “The word “original” is susceptible to different 
meanings in the context of a particular statute. It does not 
always mean “first in order”. The expression “original order” 
in section 3(2) of the Ordinance was used in generic sense in 
contradistinction to orders passed in appeal, revision or 
review. In Macmilan and Company Limited versus K. and J. 
Cooper (AIR 1924 Privy Counsel 75), a case from Bombay 
jurisdiction, the Privy Council had the occasion to interpret the 
word “original” in the context of Copyright Act, 1911, as 
follows:--- 
       “The word “original” does not mean that the work must 
be the expression of original or inventive thought. Copyright 
Acts are not concerned with the opinion of ideas, but with the 
expression of thoughts; and in the case of “literary work” with 
the expression of thought in print or writing. The originality 
which is required relates to the expression of the thought; but 
the Act does not require that the expression must be in an 
original or novel form, but that the work must not be copied 
from another work-that it should originate from the author.” 
     “The mere process of selecting passages from works 
readily accessible to the public is not, but difficulty in 
obtaining access to ‘the originals or skill manifested in making 
or arranging the selection is sufficient to give the character of 
an “original literary work” to the selection.” 
      In Re Oriental Bank (54 L.J.Ch.481) it was held on the 
construction of, a clause in the Charter of that Bank that the 
words “original-holder” of shares did not mean the first 
allottee, but meant the immediate transferor to the person 
holding the shares at the time when the phrase became 
operative i.e. in that case, the winding-up of the company.” 
 We can, therefore, easily concluded that in order 
to maintain Intra Court Appeal before the Division 
Bench of this Court, the test is as to whether the 
“original order” passed in the proceedings, 

                                        ICA No.28717/2023 
   
 
 
                                4     
 
provided an appeal, revision or review to an 
aggrieved person and not the one which was 
subject matter of writ petition. Reliance in this 
regard is placed on case reported as “Mst. Karim 
Bibi and others vs. Hussain Bakhsh and another 
(PLD 1984 SC 344), wherein it has been laid 
down as under:-  
 “After giving our anxious consideration to the arguments 
urged in support of this appeal, we are, however, not 
impressed by any of the contentions raised. The test laid down 
by the Legislature in the proviso is that if the law applicable to 
the proceedings from the Constitutional Petition arises 
provides for at least one appeal against the original order, then 
no appeal would be competent from the order of a Single 
Judge in the constitutional jurisdiction to a Bench of two or 
more Judges of the High Court. The crucial words are the 
“original order”. It is clear from the wording of the proviso 
that the requirement of the availability of an appeal in the law 
applicable is not in relation to the impugned order in the 
Constitutional Petition, which may be the order passed by the 
lowest officer or authority in the hierarchy or an order passed 
by higher authorities in appeal, revision or review, if any, 
provided in the relevant statute. Therefore, the relevant order 
may not necessarily be the one which is under challenged but 
the test is whether the original order passed in the proceedings 
subject to an appeal under the relevant law, irrespective of the 
fact whether the remedy of appeal, so provided was availed of 
or not. Apparently the meaning of the expression “original 
order” is the order with which the proceedings under the 
relevant statute commenced. The word “proceedings” has 
been used in different enactments and has been subject to 
judicial interpretation in a number of cases wherein it has 
received either restricted or wide meaning according to the 
text and subject-matter or the particular statute.”   
 
 
 
 
 
It was further laid down in the above judgment  
 
 
 
 
 
that:- 
“The obvious intention underlying the provision was to 
abolish Intra-Court Appeal in cases in which the impugned 
order in the Constitutional order arises out of the proceedings 
in which the original order was appealable. Necessarily 
therefore, the question whether the original order was 
appealable or not will be determinable with reference to the 

                                        ICA No.28717/2023 
   
 
 
                                5     
 
law that was applicable on the date of such original order and 
not the date when the matter came up before the High Court in 
Constitutional jurisdiction. Similarly, we are unable to see any 
force in the contention that the word “proceedings” should be 
given restricted meaning so as to confine it to the proceedings 
before the authority which passed the order under challenge in 
the Constitutional Petition which in the present case was suo 
motu 
proceedings 
commenced 
by 
the 
Settlement 
Commissioner. By no stretch can the order passed in revision 
be construed as the original order as contemplated by the 
proviso under consideration.”  
 Similar view has been reiterated by the 
Apex Court in case reported as “SME Bank 
Limited through President Islamabad and others 
..Vs.. Izhar ul Haq (2019 SCMR 939)”, wherein it 
has been laid down as under:- 
“It is admitted fact that disciplinary proceedings were 
conducted against the respondent under the Regulations stated 
above, which ultimately resulted into imposition of penalty 
vide Office Order dated 02.06.2003, against which under the 
said Regulations, which are stated by the respondent to be 
statutory, the remedy of appeal and review is provided. We are 
of the view that where the proceedings from which the writ 
petition has arisen provided for either review, revision or 
appeal, in terms of proviso to section 3 of the Ordinance of 
1972, remedy of ICA will not be available against the 
judgment passed by the learned Single Judge ion the writ 
petition.” 
In case reported as “Shafqat Ali ..Vs.. 
Chairman, Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory 
Authority, PEMRA and 5 others (2022 CLC 
1473)”, a Division Bench of this Court held as 
under:- 
“ The reference is clearly to the proceedings taken 
under any statute which prescribes a hierarchy of officers or 
authorities for carrying into effect the purposes of such statute 
including the enforcement of rights, if any, created thereunder. 
In such a case the law clearly envisages an original order 
against which the remedy of Appeal was provided by the 
statute.  

                                        ICA No.28717/2023 
   
 
 
                                6     
 
9. 
Therefore, it is clear from the wording of the proviso 
that the requirement of the availability of an appeal in the law 
applicable is not in relation to the impugned order only in the 
Constitutional Petition. Apparently the meaning of the 
expression original order is the order with which the 
proceedings under the relevant statute commenced. A 
proceeding would include every step taken towards a further 
progress of a cause in Court. The proceedings commences 
with the first step by which the machinery of law is put into 
motion.” 
5. 
Here in the instant case, subject matter in the 
writ petition before the learned Single Judge in 
Chamber was the findings of First Medical 
Examiner. Now we have to examine, as to whether 
against such findings/proceedings, any remedy of 
appeal, revision or review before any authority was 
provided to an aggrieved person or not. In this 
regard, Gazette Notification No.SO (H & D)5-
5/2002 dated 05.02.2003 of the Government of 
Punjab is of much significance, which provided a 
three tier procedure for conducting medico legal 
work. For ready reference said notification is 
reproduced as under:- 
 
 
 
Gazette of Punjab,Part I, 
 
 
 
    5th February, 2003 
No. SO (H&D) 5-5/2002, dated 05.02.2003.--- 
Pursuant to the orders of the Governor following amendments 
in procedure are hereby ordered for revamping of medico legal 
work in Punjab with immediate effect. 
1. 
A “Three Tier Structure for the conduction 
of medico legal work has been established.  
(a). FIRST TIER  
The Initial Medicolegal examination shall be carried out by 
the Medical Officers/Women Medical Officers at the Rural 
Health Centers, Tehsil Headquarters Hospitals, District 
Headquarters Hospitals and at Teaching Hospitals.   
(b). SECOND TIER  

                                        ICA No.28717/2023 
   
 
 
                                7     
 
The District Standing Medical Boards, comprising the 
following, shall act as First Appellate Authority in all the 34 
Districts of Punjab:  
Medical Superintendent, DHQ Hospital Chairman  
 
District Officer Health      
       Member  
 
Surgeon   
  
  
       Member            
These Boards will conduct re-examination if the decision 
of the first medico legal examiner is challenged and also 
for examination of alleged cases of police torture. For 
District Lahore District Standing Medical Board will be 
established at Government Mian Muhammad Munshi, DHQ, 
Hospital.   
(C) THIRD TIER  
The role of Surgeon medico legal, the Punjab shall only be 
Appellate and Supervisory. He shall be the Chairman of 
Provincial Standing Medical Board, which shall be the final 
Appellate Authority against the decisions of District Standing 
Medical Boards. Other members of the Provincial Standing 
Medical Board (PSMB) will be the Associate/Assistant 
Professor Forensic Medicine of the Regional Medical College 
and the Medical Superintendent of one of the attached 
Teaching Hospital. The Board can co-opt any other member 
when required.”  
From the above notification, it is manifestly clear 
that opinion of First Medical Examiner, can be 
challenged in appeal by an aggrieved person 
before the District Standing Medical Board and 
second appeal lies before the Provincial Standing 
Medical Board in Appellate/Supervisory capacity.    
This “Three Tier Structure” for conduction of 
medico legal work has been recognized by the 
apex Court in case reported as “Mst. Lubna Bibi 
..Vs.. Azhar Javed Abbas and another (2022 SCMR 
946)”.  
6. 
For what has been discussed above, we have 
no doubt in our mind that against the “original 
order” i.e. opinion of Initial Medical Examiner, 
two tier remedy of appeal i.e. before District 
Standing Medical Board and Provincial Standing 
Medical Board was available to the appellant, 

                                        ICA No.28717/2023 
   
 
 
                                8     
 
therefore, irrespective of the fact that what was 
impugned/challenged in the writ petition, instant 
Intra Court Appeal is not maintainable, which 
stands dismissed in-limine.
