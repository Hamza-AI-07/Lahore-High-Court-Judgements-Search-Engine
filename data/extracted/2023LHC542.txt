RESPONDENTS BY: 
Mr. Mubin ud Qazi, Advocate for respondent 
No.3. 
Mr. Asad Ali Bajwa, D.A.G. 
 
Shahid Karim, J:- This constitutional petition 
brings a challenge to the judgment dated 13.3.2019 
passed by the Election Commission of Pakistan 
(ECP).  
2. 
The facts are admitted on all hands.  The 
purported reference was filed by respondent No.3 
before ECP under various provisions of law, none of 
them seems to be applicable nor has any relevance to 
the case in hand.  The first reference was made to 
Article 218 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic 
of Pakistan, 1973 (“the Constitution”) which is a 
general Article prescribing powers of ECP under the 
Constitution.   Certain provisions of Representation 
of the People Act, 1976 (“ROPA”) have also been 
invoked.  Suffice to say that these provisions are 
non-applicable since the purported reference was 
filed on 01.02.2018 when the Elections Act, 2017 
(Act, 2017) had been promulgated and thereby 

W.P.No.30623 of 2019 
2
ROPA had been repealed.  (See section 240(2) of the 
Act, 2017. 
3. 
The observation of ECP in paragraph 8 of the 
impugned order is based on an erroneous view of 
section 6, General Clauses Act.  The effect of repeal 
is that it will only save pending proceedings and any 
proceedings commenced after the enactment of Act, 
2017 will be governed by the new law and the 
provisions of old law cannot be invoked.  This will, 
however, not have any impact since substantially, the 
offences under both the laws are in pari materia 
under which the petitioner in Reference before ECP 
sought a declaration of guilt regarding those 
offences.  The following was the prayer made in the 
Reference: 
―In view of the submissions made above, the 
petitioner seeks gracious relief from this Hon‘ble 
Authority, to the effect that: 
(i) 
A declaration may graciously be issued to the effect 
that the Resp. No.1/Mian Muhammad Tariq 
Member of the Provincial Assembly of Punjab from 
PP-113 Gujrat–VI, is guilty of committing corrupt 
practice under sec. 78(3)(d) read with Sec. 82 and 
94 of ROPA, 1976 as well as Secs. 167(a), 173(d), 
174, 190 of the Elections Act, 2017, for submitting 
false 
declarations/statements 
of 
assets 
and 
liabilities (assets/income from employment and 
business in Spain) in his nomination papers as well 
as in the yearly returns required to be submitted 
under Sec. 42-A of ROPA 1976 read with Sec. 137 
of the Election Act, 2017, for his both terms i.e., 
years 2008 to 2013 and 2013 to 2017.  
(ii) 
Criminal proceedings may please also be directed 
to be initiated against the Resp. No.1/Mian Tariq 
Mehmood under Sec. 82 read with Sec. 42-A(4) of 
ROPA, 1976 read with Sec. 137(4) of the Election 
Act, 2017, for committing the offence of corrupt 
practice, 
for 
submitting 
false 
declarations/ 
statements of assets and liabilities in the yearly 
returns required to be submitted under Sec. 42-A of 
ROPA, 1976 read with Sec. 137 of the Election Act, 
2017, for the years 2008 to 2013 and 2013-17. 
Consequently, the Resp. No.1/Mian Tariq Mehmood 
may please also be declared disqualified under Sec. 
100 ROPA, 1976 read with Sec. 232 of the Election 

W.P.No.30623 of 2019 
3
Act, 2017, besides disqualification incurred on the 
basis of being a dishonest person.‖ 
 
4. 
As will be seen in the following paragraphs, 
ECP granted a relief which is diametrically opposed 
to one sought by the respondent No.3.  It made an 
order of disqualification against the present petitioner 
which is, doubtless, outwith the powers of ECP.  
While reading the impugned order, one cannot help 
being aghast at the audacity of overreach by ECP.   
5. 
The only provisions which were remotely 
relevant for the purposes of decision of the Reference 
were Sections 137 (4) and 190 of the Act, 2017 
which provide that: 
―137(4) (4)   Where a Member submits the 
statement of assets and liabilities under this section 
which is found to be false in material particulars, he 
may, within one hundred and twenty days from the 
date submission of the statement, be proceeded 
against for committing the offence of corrupt 
practice.‖ 
   
190. Cognizance and trial.— (1) Notwithstanding 
anything contained in any other law but subject to 
section 193, an offence under this Chapter shall be 
tried by the Sessions Judge and any aggrieved 
person may, within thirty days of the passing of the 
final order, file an appeal against the order in the 
High Court which shall be heard by a Division 
Bench of the High Court. 
(2)   The proceedings against a person for being 
involved in corrupt or illegal practice may be 
initiated on a complaint made by a person or by the 
Commission but if a complaint made by the person 
proves to be false, based on bad faith or is made for 
any ulterior motive to provide benefit to another 
person, the complainant shall be punishable with 
imprisonment for a term which may extend to six 
months or with fine which may extend to fifty 
thousand rupees or with both. 
(3)  The Commission may direct that the summary 
trial of an offence under this Act may be conducted 
in accordance with the provisions of Chapter XX of 
the Code. 
 
6. 
A reading of the two provisions set out above 
would show that section 137 deals with submission 

W.P.No.30623 of 2019 
4
of statements of assets and liabilities and it obliges 
every member of an Assembly and Senate to submit 
to the Commission before a certain date a copy of the 
statement of assets and liabilities including assets 
and liabilities of his spouse and dependent children.  
This shall be published by the Commission through a 
press release and in case of default by any of the 
members the names shall be published by the 
Commission.  Sub-section (3) grants to the 
Commission the power to suspend the membership 
of a member of an Assembly and Senate who fails to 
submit the statement.  The only power which may be 
attracted under the circumstances is couched in sub-
section (4) which provides that if a member submits 
the statement of assets and liabilities under Section 
137 and which is found to be false in material 
particulars, he may within 120 days from the date of 
submission of the statement be proceeded against for 
committing the offence of corrupt practice.  Sub-
section (4) does not provide the authority in which 
this power vests.  It merely provides that the member 
who has given a false statement in material 
particulars may be proceeded for committing the 
offence of corrupt practice.  Contrary to this the ECP 
in the impugned order made the following 
declaration: 
―11. 
We have examined the case at the touch 
stone and we find ourselves unable to decline the 
prayer of the petitioner on the basis of material 
available on record.  Any refusal on our part to 
avoid or evade such an exercise would constitute a 
departure from the law.  Resultantly, instant 

W.P.No.30623 of 2019 
5
petition is accepted under Article 218 (3) read with 
Article 62(1) (f) and Article 63 of the Constitution 
and respondent No.1 is declared disqualified from 
having been member of Provincial Assembly 
Constituency PP-113 Gujrat-VI against general 
elections 2013.  The notification be issued 
accordingly.  These are the detailed reasons of our 
short order of even date.‖ 
 
 
The above conclusion was preceded by the 
observations that the petitioner has made false 
declaration in the nomination form.  He was 
disqualified on that basis. 
7. 
The entire reliance of ECP, it can be seen from 
the portion which has been reproduced above, is 
upon Article 218 of the Constitution read with 
Article 62(1)(f) and Article 63 of the Constitution 
and proceeded to declare the petitioner disqualified 
from being a member of the Provincial Assembly 
from the Constituency PP-113 Gujrat-VI.  Article 
218 provides that: 
―218(1) For the purpose of election to both Houses 
of 
Majlis-e-Shoora 
(Parliament), 
Provincial 
Assemblies and for election  tosuch other public 
offices as may be specified by law, a permanent 
Election Commission shall be constituted in 
accordance with this Article. 
 
(2) The Election Commission shall consist of—  
(a) the Commissioner who shall be Chairman 
of the Commission; and  
 
(b) four members, each of whom has been a 
Judge of a High Court from each Province, 
appointed by the President in the manner 
provided for appointment of the Commissioner 
in clauses (2A) and (2B) of Article 213. 
 
Explanation.—―senior civil servant‖ and 
―technocrat‖ shall have the same meaning as 
given in clause (2) of Article 213. 
 
(3) It shall be the duty of the Election Commission 
to organize and conduct the election and to make 
such arrangements as are necessary to ensure that 
the election is conducted honestly, justly, fairly and 
in accordance with law, and that corrupt practices 
are guarded against.‖ 

W.P.No.30623 of 2019

8. 
Article 218 constitutes ECP for the purpose of 
elections 
to 
both 
houses 
of 
Majlis-e-Shura 
(Parliament), Provincial Assemblies and for election 
to such other public offices as may be specified by 
law.  The ECP in the impugned order has invoked to 
its aid clause (3) of Article 218 to make a declaration 
that the petitioner was disqualified from being a 
member of the Provincial Assembly.  This power 
cannot be culled out from clause (3) of Article 218 
and such an action by ECP must be discountenanced.  
Clause (3) of Article 218 merely casts a duty on ECP 
to organize and conduct elections and to make 
arrangements to ensure that the elections are 
conducted justly and fairly and in accordance with 
law.  During the course of conduct of the elections it 
must also guard against corrupt practices.  By no 
stretch of imagination it has empowered ECP to 
entertain a reference such as one in the present case 
and to embark upon an inquiry to disqualify a 
member of the Assembly or the Senate.  Such a 
course is impermissible to ECP and would nullify the 
intent that permeates the relevant provisions not only 
of the Constitution but also of the Act, 2017.  Further 
it is a fallacy on the part of ECP to have relied upon 
Articles 62 and 63 as conferring power on ECP to 
make a declaration of the kind which has been done 
through the impugned order.  Articles 62 and 63 
merely 
prescribe 
the 
qualifications 
and 
disqualifications of a person from being elected or 

W.P.No.30623 of 2019 
7
chosen as and from being a member of the 
Parliament and a Provincial Assembly and no more.  
The procedural requirements for doing so and the 
power which comes to vest in a Court or other 
Tribunal to set in motion the proceedings for doing 
so must be prescribed in law.  Clause (2) of Article 
63 clearly provides that if any question arises 
whether a member of the Parliament (or a Provincial 
Assembly) has become disqualified from being a 
member of that Assembly, the Speaker or the 
Chairman shall refer the question to ECP which shall 
be decided within ninety days from the receipt of the 
reference from the Speaker or Chairman of the 
Senate.  The only time that ECP can proceed to 
adjudicate upon such a controversy is when a 
reference is received from either the Speaker or the 
Chairman of the Senate.  Apart from this ECP is n ot 
vested with any power to broach the subject of 
disqualification on any reference filed by a private 
person which exercise will be ultra vires the 
Constitution as well as the Act, 2017.   
9. 
A reference may also be made to Chapter IX 
which relates to the resolution of election disputes.  
Section 139 provides that: 
139.   Election petition.—(1) No election shall be 
called in question except by an election petition 
filed by a candidate for that election. 
(2)  In this Chapter— 
(a)  ‗corrupt or illegal practice‘ means a 
‗corrupt practice‘ or an ‗illegal practice‘ as 
defined in Chapter X; 
 
(b)  ‗petitioner‘ means the candidate who has 
filed an election petition; and 

W.P.No.30623 of 2019 
8
 
(c)  ‗respondent‘ means a person joined as 
respondent in the election petition under 
section 143. 
 
10. This provision has been enacted pursuant to the 
mandate of Article 225 of the Constitution which 
provides that: 
―225. No election to a House or a Provincial 
Assembly shall be called in question except by an 
election petition presented to such tribunal and in 
such manner as may be determined by Act of 
Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament).‖ 
 
11. It indubitably follows that under the law no 
election shall be called in question except by an 
election petition filed by a candidate for that election.  
Thus, 
the 
Constitution 
and 
the 
law 
have 
circumscribed the powers of ECP as well as the 
Courts to adjudicate election disputes.  It cannot be 
left to the whimsical discretion of ECP to do so on an 
application filed by a private person which will not 
only impinge upon the rights of the members of the 
Parliament, Provincial Assembly or Senate but also 
will have the unpalatable effect of stifling the 
democratic 
process 
where 
members 
of 
the 
Parliament, Provincial Assembly and Senate will be 
subjected to undue harassment and frivolity at the 
hands of unscrupulous persons who may bring 
motivated petitions before ECP.   
12. The controversy whether Article 218(3) of the 
Constitution does clothe ECP with such powers has 
been laid to rest by Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
Muhammad Salman v. Naveed Anjum (2021 SCMR 
1675) where it was stated that: 

W.P.No.30623 of 2019 
9
―…It is contended that it is inherent in the 
jurisdiction and powers conferred by Article 218(3) 
on the Commission, and the constitutional duty so 
cast on it, that it be empowered to adjudicate on 
whether a candidate (or member of the legislature) 
is qualified (or, by extension, disqualified) in terms 
of Articles 62 and/or 63 respectively. Now, this 
question is one that be raised on an independent, 
standalone basis, or it can be part of an election 
dispute. Learned counsel submitted that in either 
case, the Commission had inherent jurisdiction and 
powers under Article 218(3). Thus, in the present 
case, it was fully empowered to consider and decide 
the applications filed by Mr. Qureshi and Mr. 
Anjum, independently of section 9 or any other 
provision of law. 
24. 
When put this way, the submissions 
require us to consider Article 218(3) without taking 
into consideration any statutory provision at all 
such as, e.g., section 9 or section 103AA. Such an 
exercise does, one must confess, take on a certain 
air of abstractedness. The reason is that inevitably 
the jurisdiction of the Commission to consider 
questions of qualification or disqualification is not 
invoked in terms of Article 218(3) alone. Rather, it 
is inextricably interlinked with statutory provisions 
(especially 
those 
just 
mentioned), 
and 
the 
Commission itself tends to consider the matters 
before it in such terms. Indeed, that is how it treated 
the appellant's case in the impugned order. In order 
to consider the position under Article 218(3) on a 
standalone basis, i.e., on the constitutional plane 
alone, as we are invited to do, requires us then to 
look at the other relevant provisions in the 
Constitution in this regard. 
25. 
Now, the Constitution itself confers a 
jurisdiction on the Commission with regard to the 
disqualification of members of the Federal and 
Provincial legislatures. This is contained in clauses 
(2) and (3) of Article 63 (read, as appropriate, with 
Article 113), which provide as follows:  
 
"(2) If any question arises whether a member 
of Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) has become 
disqualified from being a member, the 
Speaker or, as the case may be, the 
Chairman shall, unless he decides that no 
such question has arisen, refer the question 
to the Election Commission within thirty days 
and should he fail to do so within the 
aforesaid period it shall be deemed to have 
been referred to the Election Commission. 
 
(3) The Election Commission shall decide the 
question within ninety days from its receipt 
or deemed to have been received and if it is 
of the opinion that the member has become 
disqualified, he shall cease to be a member 
and his seat shall become vacant." 
A special type of disqualification, by defection, is 

W.P.No.30623 of 2019 
10
provided for in Article 63A. Clauses (3) and (4) 
specifically empower the Commission to rule on the 
validity of the declaration of defection against a 
member. (Clause (5) allows for a direct appeal to 
this Court against the decision of the Commission.) 
Thus, the Constitution is not silent on whether or 
when (and if so, under what circumstances) the 
Commission has the power to consider the issue of 
disqualification. The question therefore becomes 
whether this specific conferment of power is 
exhaustive. In other words, if the Constitution has 
itself conferred a limited, and not general, power 
and jurisdiction on the Commission in terms as 
noted above, can a general power nonetheless be 
discovered as inhering in Article 218(3)? In our 
view, the answer ought to be in the negative. The 
reason is that that would render the relevant 
provisions of Articles 63 and 63A redundant. These 
provisions can only be invoked in a special manner 
and on fulfillment of certain conditions. If a general 
power 
inhered 
in 
Article 
218(3) 
then 
the 
constitutional safeguards contained therein would 
be rendered meaningless. They could be bypassed at 
will and at any time. Furthermore, the well known 
legal maxim, expressio unius est exclusio alterious, 
may also be relevant in the present context. No 
doubt the maxim must be applied cautiously: it has 
been said to be a valuable servant but a dangerous 
master. But even within such limitations it provides 
a useful aid in addressing the question now under 
consideration. In our view, to the extent that the 
Constitution considered it appropriate to itself 
confer a jurisdiction on the Commission to examine 
questions of qualification or disqualification on an 
independent, standalone basis, it expressly provided 
for the same in the Articles noted above. Anything 
other than that, unsupported by statute law (i.e., in 
terms of a jurisdiction conferred by Parliament itself 
by enacting a law in terms of Article 222) would be 
beyond the power of the Commission. More 
particularly, no such power can be discovered in 
terms of Article 218(3) or said to inhere in the 
Commission in terms thereof. 
26. 
Insofar as the question of qualification or 
disqualification, arising as part of an election 
dispute and being considered by the Commission 
directly in terms of Article 218(3), is concerned, the 
provisions of Article 225 need to be kept in mind. 
This provides as follows: "No election to a House or 
a Provincial Assembly shall be called in question 
except by an election petition presented to such 
tribunal and in such manner as may be determined 
by Act of Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament)". To hold 
that there is an independent power inhering in the 
Commission in terms of Article 218(3) would trench 
upon this constitutional provision which, it is to be 
noted, is cast in strongly negative terms. This 
indicates that those election disputes as properly 
come within the scope of Article 225 are to be 
considered by an election tribunal and not 
elsewhere and before some other forum such as, 

W.P.No.30623 of 2019 
11
e.g., the Commission purporting to exercise a 
jurisdiction said to inhere in it under Article 218(3). 
It is no doubt for this reason that both in terms of 
section 103AA and section 9, the Commission was, 
and continues to be, "deemed to be an Election 
Tribunal to which an election petition has been 
presented". And even here, interestingly, the 
jurisdiction conferred on the Commission came, and 
comes, with a sunset provision: it must decide the 
matter within the stipulated 60 days, else "the 
election of the returned candidate shall be deemed 
to have become final", subject to a petition (if any) 
before the election tribunal constituted in terms of 
section 57 of the 1976 Act and now section 140 of 
the 2017 Act. (The question, whether a law can at 
all deem the Commission to be an election tribunal 
is one that, though interesting, need not trouble us 
here.) 
27. 
It follows from the foregoing discussion 
that in our view there is no power or jurisdiction 
inherent in the Commission itself in terms of 
Article 218(3) to consider the qualification/ 
disqualification of a candidate/member, whether as 
an independent, standalone issue or as part of an 
election dispute…” 
 
 
And reiterated in C.P No.397 of 2022 in the 
following words: 
―…The Election Commission of Pakistan (―ECP‖) 
has, in exercise of its powers under Article 218(3) 
of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan 1973, (―Constitution‖) read with Section 
8(c) of the Elections Act, 2017, decided upon the 
matter 
of 
pre-election 
qualification 
and 
disqualification of the petitioner, in respect of his 
election as a member of the National Assembly as 
well as a member of the Senate. The ECP has 
declared the petitioner disqualified for both 
elections on account of his filing a false affidavit as 
to his citizenship of foreign country under Article 
63(1)(c) and 62(1)(f) of the Constitution, and has 
also withdrawn the notification whereby he had 
been declared the returned candidate for a seat of 
the Senate.  
3. 
As per the judgments of this Court, in 
Muhammad Salman v. Naveed Anjum (2021 
SCMR 1675) and Zulfiqar Bhatti v. E.C.P (C.A 
No.142 of 2019 decided on 02.11.2022), the ECP 
has no jurisdiction under Article 218(3) of the 
Constitution read with Section 8(c) or 9(1) of the 
Elections Act 2017 to inquire into and decide upon 
the matter of pre-election qualification and 
disqualification 
of 
a 
returned 
candidate. 
Therefore, the decision of the ECP was without 
jurisdiction….. 
 

W.P.No.30623 of 2019 
12
13. In view of the above holding, for all intents, 
ECP is denuded of any inclination to broaden upon 
its powers and read into Article 218(3) such 
expanded powers which do not vest in it. This 
penchant for broadening of powers is anathema to 
rule of law and basic foundations of constitutional 
democracy. We live under a Constitution and all 
powers flow from it especially those that affect a 
citizen‟s rights. They culminate in an act of authority 
affecting the legal balance sheet of certain 
individuals. We have laws which invest a person, or 
a body of persons, with authority to regulate the 
behavior of other persons. The repositories of such 
powers are authorized to impose rights and liabilities 
and to confer privileges and immunities on certain 
individuals. It is incredulous to note that ECP chose 
to exercise jurisdiction over subject-matter while 
none existed. The essence of any legal system lies in 
the limitations placed by it upon the exercise of 
power; no grant of power by Parliament can be 
totally unlimited. 
14. The decision of ECP in this case runs counter to 
the doctrine of jurisdictional facts. „If a certain state 
of facts has to exist before an inferior tribunal have 
jurisdiction, they can inquire into the facts in order to 
decide whether they have jurisdiction but cannot give 
themselves jurisdiction by a wrong decision upon 
them‟. (Per Lord Goddard C.J in R.V Fulham, 

W.P.No.30623 of 2019 
13
Hammersmith and Kensington R.T., Exp. Zerek 
[1951]2K.B.1, at 6) 
 
‗The lines which discriminate jurisdictions are 
fine, but they are clear and distinct, and if they are 
once effaced, endless and inextricable confusion 
must be the consequence.‘ [Grahan v. Maingay 
(1793) Ridg.L.&S.20,72] 
15. That warning (quoted in Jurisdiction and 
Illegality by Amnon Rubinstein, 2007) given at the 
end of eighteenth century, is particularly apposite 
nowadays with the growth of new inferior 
jurisdictions. ECP‟s action is a classic case of want 
of jurisdiction having been taken beyond the sphere 
allotted to it by law. It is regarded as usurpation of 
power unwarranted by law. The bounden duty of 
ECP, under the constitution and law, to determine the 
jurisdictional facts at the commencement of the 
inquiry. If they do not exist, ECP must abstain and 
go no further. In this context it is important that such 
action must stem from a legal provision and which 
must be stated clearly in a notice issued to any 
person. A notice which does not mention the relevant 
statutory provision under which ECP purports to 
derive its powers is a nullity and a misdirection of 
law which then feeds through the rest of the 
decision-making process. ECP cannot add to its 
litany of powers at its whims.  
16. It is of fundamental importance to emphasis that 
jurisdiction lies at the foundation of all legal 

W.P.No.30623 of 2019 
14
proceedings. If it is not present, the proceeding is 
void. In the classic words of Chief Justice John 
Marshall, ―we have no more right to decline the 
exercise of jurisdiction which is given, then to usurp 
that which is not given. The one or the other would 
be treason to the constitution‖.  
[Cohen v. Virginia (1821) 19US(16Wheat)264] 
 
Article 175, Clause (2) provides that: 
―175(2) No court shall have any jurisdiction 
save as is or may be conferred on it by the 
Constitution or by or under any law.‖ 
 
17. The above mandate equally applies to executive 
authorities and high-powered tribunals such as ECP. 
In administrative law, jurisdiction merely means 
legal authority or power. (See, legal control of 
Government by Bernard Schwartz and H.W.R Wade, 
p.210). As Lord Denning said in R.v Chief 
Immigration Officer (1980)3 All ER 373, 379), ―No 
jurisdiction means no power.‖ 
18. I do not find the act of ECP in deciding the 
petition/ reference filed by respondent No.3 to have 
any basis in law and the impugned judgment is 
clearly unlawful and non-est.  It is liable to be set 
aside as being without lawful authority.  This petition 
is allowed.
