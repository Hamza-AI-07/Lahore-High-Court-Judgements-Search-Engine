MASUD ABID NAQVI, J.  
Brief 
facts 
necessary 
for 
the 
adjudication of this lis are that the plaintiff/petitioner instituted a suit 
for possession through specific performance of an agreement to sell 
dated 06.08.2001/Ex.P-1 with the averments that he paid an amount of 
Rs.2,20,000/- to the defendant/respondent as total sale consideration 
and the possession of suit land was also delivered to him by the 
defendant/respondent. By paying all the dues on behalf of defendant/ 
respondent for obtaining proprietary rights, he ensured the execution 
of deed No.1089/1 dated 05.12.2005 in favour of defendant/ 
respondent. The defendant/respondent contested the suit by filing 
written statement and specifically denied the execution of agreement 
to sell & receipt of sale consideration. After the framing of issues, the 
parties produced their respective oral & documentary evidence and 
learned trial court dismissed the suit vide judgment and decree dated 
08.12.2010. Feeling aggrieved, the plaintiff/petitioner filed an appeal 
and learned Additional District Judge vide judgment & decree dated 

C. R. No.59135-2022

13.09.2022 dismissed the appeal. Being dissatisfied, the plaintiff/ 
petitioner has filed the instant Revision Petition and challenged the 
validity of the judgments and decrees passed by the learned courts 
below. 
2. 
I have heard the arguments of learned counsels for the parties 
and perused the available record as well as have minutely gone 
through the impugned judgments and decrees. 
3. 
It is a well-settled law that the initial burden of proof is on the 
plaintiff to substantiate his/her claim(s) by adducing cogent, legal, 
relevant and unimpeachable evidence of definitiveness. In order to 
prove issue No.1, Jamal Abdul Nasir/attorney of plaintiff/petitioner 
appeared as PW-5 and produced Muhammad Saddique as PW-1 and 
Muhammad Shafiq Ramay as PW-2, Muhammad Sabir as PW-3 and 
Muhammad Zafar as PW-4. While appearing as PW-5, Jamal Abdul 
Nasir/attorney of plaintiff/petitioner frankly conceded alteration/ 
modification/interpolation in the text of disputed agreement to sell 
dated 06.08.2001/Ex.P-1 in cross-examination which is reproduced 
hereunder;

Only alive attesting witness of disputed agreement to sell 
namely Muhammad Sabir appeared as PW-3 and conceded in cross-
examination certain facts which are reproduced hereunder;

By bare reading the contents of disputed agreement to sell, there 
remains no doubt that original written amount of Rs.20000/- was 
altered to Rs.22000/- by cutting the zero (0) to two (2) and thereafter 
due to shortage of space another/additional zero (0) was added/written 
above the altered amount of Rs.22000/-. Similarly, half of the amount 
was originally written as Rs.10000/- which was also altered to 
Rs.11000/- by cutting the zero (0) to one (1) and thereafter due to 
shortage of space another/additional zero (0) was written above the 
altered amount of Rs.11000/-. Hence, there is clear alteration/ 
modification/interpolation/addition in the text of disputed agreement 
to sell and the unauthorized material altered/modified/added part of 
disputed agreement by one party without the consent of other party is 
not only illegal, unlawful, void but also unenforceable by law because 
the consensus ad idem is considered the most essential part of an 
agreement. The consent of both the parties about alteration/ 
modification/interpolation/addition in the text of disputed agreement 
can be judged if an additional note with the signatures of both the 
parties to the disputed agreement or at least with the signature of 
alleged 
seller/defendant/respondent 
confirming 
the 
alteration/ 

C. R. No.59135-2022

modification/interpolation/addition with mutual consent is available / 
written on the disputed agreement or through an additional document 
confirming the consent about the alteration/modification/interpolation 
/addition with the signatures of both the parties to the disputed 
agreement or at least with the signature of alleged seller/ defendant/ 
respondent or putting signatures near the cuttings & added words. 
None of the requirements showing the consent of alleged seller/ 
defendant/respondent are either pleaded or proved through oral & 
documentary evidence. Hence, even the material changes in the 
disputed agreement without the consent of seller make disputed 
agreement to sell unenforceable by law rather this is a fraudulent 
transaction.   
4. 
It is settled law that jurisdiction of the courts to grant relief of 
specific performance is discretionary in nature and cannot be claimed 
as a matter of right.  Reference is made to case reported as 
Muhammad Riaz Hussain Vs Zahoor ul Hassan (2021 SCMR 431). 
The learned courts below have rightly refused relief of specific 
performance by considering the conduct of the parties, the principles 
of equity, fairness and good conscious by appreciating the pleadings 
of the parties as well as oral and documentary evidence of the parties 
and thereafter reached at the conclusion regarding the controversy, 
therefore, findings of learned courts below are maintained/upheld and 
granting 
discretionary 
relief 
to 
petitioner/plaintiff 
in 
such 
circumstances would be highly unfair and inequitable. 

C. R. No.59135-2022

5. 
The plaintiff/petitioner has not only failed to prove the 
execution of agreement to sell/Exh.P.1 as well as payment of sale 
consideration through oral and documentary evidence rather there are 
contradictions in the depositions of PW’s and averments of the plaint,  
which is properly discussed by the learned courts below while 
dismissing the suit as well as the appeal.   
6. 
With respect to interference in concurrent findings of the Courts 
below, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case reported as 
Administrator, Thal Development through EACO Bhakkar and 
others Vs Ali Muhammad (2012 SCMR 730) held that:- 
“Concurrent findings of the trial court and appellate 
court in favour of appellants were based on proper 
appreciation of evidence therefore, the same were not 
open to interference by the revisional court in exercise of 
its jurisdiction under section 115, C.P.C. which is 
primarily 
meant 
for 
correction 
of 
jurisdictional 
defect/error and material illegalities / irregularities, 
resulting in miscarriage of justice to a party.”  
6. 
Neither any misreading or non-reading of evidence on record 
nor any infirmity, legal or factual, has been pointed out in the 
impugned judgments and decrees passed by the learned Courts below, 
therefore, this civil revision is hereby dismissed.
