Date of hearing 
29.11.2023. 
Appellant by 
M/s Talat Mehmood kakezai and Farooq Haider Malik, 
Advocates.

Public 
Prosecutor.

FIR No.166/2020 dated 03.04.2020 under sections 
302/34 PPC police station Bakhshan Khan, Chishtian, 
Bahawalnagar. 
Appeal against judgment dated 31.01.2022 passed by Additional Sessions 
Judge, Chishtian, District Bahawalnagar in a private complaint whereby 
Muhammad Zafar alias Gulabi was convicted and sentenced to 
imprisonment for life with a compensation of Rs.200,000/- to be paid to the 
legal heirs of deceased under section 544-A Cr.P.C., in case of default to further 
undergo six months’ simple imprisonment. Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. 
was extended; whereas co-accused Muhammad Hussain was acquitted. 
 
 
          MUHAMMAD AMJAD RAFIQ, J.  Ghulam Rasool, complainant 
and his son Munir Ahmad were standing near the Habitation camp (dera) of 
his cousin/brother-in-law Muhammad Nawaz in his company when at about 
11:30 in the morning on 03.04.2020 they saw from a distance of two Kanals 
Muhammad Hussain and Muhammad Zafar, father and son inter-se 
intercepted the motorcycle of Muhammad Nadeem, another son of 
complainant at the metaled road in front of house of Mazhar Arain. 
Muhammad Hussain co-accused (since acquitted) commanded his son 
Muhammad Zafar (appellant) while handing over pistol 30-bore to kill 
Nadeem in order to finish dispute of landed property between the parties and 
within their view Zafar made two fires which were claimed as hitting at chest 

2 
Crl.A.No.71 of 2022. 
 
and belly of Nadeem who fell down on the ground. Accused while 
brandishing weapon of offence decamped from the place of occurrence.  
2. 
Police reached at the place of occurrence within half an hour; Ghulam 
Rasool complainant (PW-1) made an oral statement before Muhammad Ali, 
SI (CW-7) who drafted the complaint, sent the same for registration of FIR 
and started process of investigation at the site. During that exercise he 
inspected the dead body, prepared inquest report, application for postmortem 
and sent the dead body to THQ Hospital under the escort of Shabbir Ahmed 
731/C; collected blood-stained earth and three crime empties, made them 
into sealed parcels, sketched the scene of crime in a site plan, recorded 
statements of witnesses, obtained their signatures on related documents. 
Additionally, he also prepared a memo of identification of dead body, 
necessity whereof is not spurred out, however, it is part of record. After 
postmortem examination, last worn clothes were produced before him which 
were taken into possession. All these articles were handed over to the 
Moharir who on 08.04.2020 handed over two parcels said to contain blood-
stained earth and crime empties for onwards transmission to the office of 
PFSA, which CW-7 deposited on 09.04.2020. On the arrest of Zafar 
(appellant) on 09.04.2020, he led to the recovery of pistol 30 bore from his 
house which was effected on 12.04.2020 and was sent to PFSA for analysis 
on 13.04.2020. The report of PFSA was received in positive. During 
investigation, he found Muhammad Hussain one of the accused as not 
involved in the commission of offence, therefore, exonerated him and 
consequently, the report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. was sent to the Court  
3. 
Being dissatisfied with the investigation, complainant filed a private 
complaint after 2½ months of the occurrence on 18.06.2020 upon which 
Muhammad Hussain and Zafar were summoned to face the trial. Charge was 
framed on information which was denied with a claim of trial, whereupon 
the prosecution produced Ghulam Rasool complainant (PW-1) and 
Muhammad Nawaz (PW-2) the ocular brigade; Shabbir Ahmed Constable 
(CW-1), Muhammad Nadeem Iqbal 1140-HC (CW-2), Sagheer Ahmed 287-
C (CW-3), Muhammad Arif ASI (CW-4), Farooq Ahmad Civil Draftsman 
(CW-5), Dr. Ghazanfar Mehmood (CW-6), Muhammad Ali SI (CW-7) and 

3 
Crl.A.No.71 of 2022. 
 
Rashid Javed ASI (CW-8). On close of prosecution case, the accused when 
examined under section 342 Cr.P.C., they denied the prosecution evidence, 
however, neither they produced any evidence in defence nor opted to make 
statements under section 340(2) Cr.P.C. and the trial ended in the terms 
detailed above.   
4. 
Learned counsel (s) for the appellant contend that witnesses were not 
present at the place of occurrence; there was a serious contradiction in 
medical and ocular account because injuries on the chest and belly were 
declared by the doctor as exit wounds; further added that memo of 
identification of dead body is a question mark on the prosecution case which 
clearly speaks absence of witnesses at the place of occurrence; that two fires 
were claimed but three crime empties were collected from the place of 
occurrence; scaled site plan was prepared with a delay of one month and 
twenty-one days and there is contradiction with respect to inter-se distance 
between deceased and assailant in two site plans, one prepared by draftsman 
and other by investigating officer. Learned counsel (s) were of the view that 
recovery of pistol is of no use for prosecution because it was not in exclusive 
possession of accused/appellant; that dispute with respect to landed property 
was not taken to the Court nor it was documented in any manner, therefore, 
motive was also not proved; that crime empties were deposited in the office 
of PFSA on 09.04.2020 and accused was also shown arrested on the same 
day, therefore, positive report is not useful for the prosecution; co-accused 
Muhammad Hussain on the same set of evidence has been acquitted. Learned 
counsel(s) relied on cases reported as “EHSAN SHAH versus STATE” (PLJ 
2021 Cr.C. (Lahore) (DB) and “MUHAMMAD ZUBAIR versus The STATE” 
(2021 YLR Note 60). 
5. 
On the other hand, learned Assistant District Public Prosecutor 
assisted by learned counsel for the complainant supported the judgment with 
the stance that it was a day light occurrence; witnesses were present at a 
distance of two Kanals from the accused, therefore, there was no mistaken 
identity of accused even otherwise both the parties were related to each other. 
Further state that there is no contradiction in medical and ocular account 
when two entry wounds were also found present, one on flank and other on 

4 
Crl.A.No.71 of 2022. 
 
back of the deceased and witnesses are not expected to explain the locale of 
injuries with exactitude; recovery of pistol stood effected; positive PFSA 
report is a strong support to prosecution case. Learned counsel for the 
complainant had an additional take on the cross examination of witnesses 
conducted by the defence, claiming it as too short to give way to admission 
of many facts as were left out during the cross examination; thus, in turn 
would be read in favour of prosecution.  
6.     Arguments proffered by the proponent and opponent set the parties at 
opposite poles to advocate their viewpoints creating a standoff; it had taken 
much time of this court to thrash the whole evidence.    
7. 
Ocular account was put forth by the prosecution through Ghulam 
Rasool complainant (PW-1) and Muhammad Nawaz (PW-2) whereas Munir 
son of the complainant was given up. Complainant in order to cover up the 
collection of three crime empties from the crime scene dishonestly improved 
his statement in examination in chief while deposing that accused had also 
made aerial firing at the site whereas no such fact was deposed by PW-2 nor 
it was mentioned in FIR or private complaint. It leaves a negative impact on 
the credibility of witnesses and doubt on prosecution story. Both the 
witnesses stated in unequivocal terms that fires made by the accused hit on 
the chest and belly of the deceased. When cross-examined on this point 
complainant PW-1 reaffirms this fact in following terms; 
“I had got recorded in my statement before police Exh.PA that the accused 
persons stopped motorcycle of my son from front side. In the same 
position Zafar accused fired on the deceased from front side. It is incorrect 
to suggest that both fires neither hit the deceased in the chest nor in 
abdomen. Wounds on the above places are exit ones and not the entry 
wound.”  
 
He further conceded that what he has stated before Investigating Officer was 
recorded by him correctly in the complaint without any addition or omission, 
similar was the stance of PW-2 and he also deposed in the same way as stated 
by PW-1. This fact is sufficient to rule out their presence at the place of 
occurrence because there was no injury on the abdomen. Complainant PW-
1 has not stated any particular reason of his presence at the place of 
occurrence and no reason for commission of murder of Nadeem was brought 
on record through any documentary proof. It was admitted by PW-1 that he 

5 
Crl.A.No.71 of 2022. 
 
did not produce any documents, FIR, copy of suit or litigation between the 
parties with respect to dispute/motive of the occurrence. During evidence, 
distance between the house of complainant and the place of occurrence could 
not be brought on record; therefore, it cannot be inferred that complainant 
was present near the Dera of Muhammad Nawaz witness at the particular 
time. Absence of witnesses is further reflected from the fact that they 
deposed in examination in chief that they attended the deceased, but they did 
not produce their clothes, if blood stained, before the Investigating Officer. 
Their presence at the time of occurrence is also belied from the fact that 
investigating officer prepared memo of identification of dead body Ex.PG at 
the place of occurrence which though was not attested by the complainant 
PW-1 but Muhammad Nawaz PW-2 cousin/brother-in-law of complainant 
and given up PW Munir Ahmed brother of deceased are the attesting 
witnesses but surprisingly without stating direct relation with the deceased, 
they mentioned before the investigating officer as follows:- 
"یہ ش نع محمد ندیم ولد غالم رسول قوم بلوچ سکنہ بستی شاہ عباس نئی آبادی 
موضع لنڈا بھڈیرہ کی ھے
جس کو ھم ذاتی طور پر جانتے ھیں جو کہ ہمارا 
قریبی عزیز تھا"۔ 
Such expression was not expected from the witnesses which shows that no 
one claimed oneself as the eye witness when investigating officer arrived at 
the place of occurrence. The identification of dead body was not known, that 
was the reason memo of identification of dead body was prepared. In such 
circumstances, it is more than impossible that witnesses were present at the 
place of occurrence and in their presence, deceased was done to death. They 
were chance witnesses who could not justifiably account for their presence 
at the place of occurrence; therefore, their testimony cannot be relied upon. 
Reliance is placed on cases reported as “MUHAMMAD ALI Versus The STATE” 
(2017 SCMR 1468) and “MUHAMMAD AKRAM Versus The STATE” (2016 
SCMR 2081). 
8. 
Absence of both the witnesses PW-1 & PW-2 at the crime scene is also 
reflected from the fact that they deposed about riding of deceased on a 
motorcycle when occurrence took place but investigating officer has not 
taken into possession any such motorcycle from the place of occurrence. It 

6 
Crl.A.No.71 of 2022. 
 
shows that deceased died in different circumstances otherwise there was no 
necessity for preparation of identification memo of dead body. The presence 
of PWs is further ruled out from the opinion of Dr. Ghazanfar Mehmood 
(CW-6), who stated that cause of death in this case was excessive blood loss. 
Had the witnesses been present at the place of occurrence, they would have 
immediately shifted the deceased to the hospital or at least an effort to stop 
the oozing of blood. With this scanty ocular account, now I move to the 
medical evidence produced by the prosecution.  
9. 
Though occurrence was of 03.04.2020 at 11:30 a.m, FIR stood 
registered at 01:10 p.m. and it was mentioned in the postmortem report that 
dead body was received in dead house at 12:30 p.m. whereas police papers 
were received at 03:45 p.m. and autopsy was conducted at 04:00 p.m. which 
clearly shows that Investigating Officer did not reach to the place of 
occurrence within half an hour otherwise dead body could have been 
dispatched with the papers in the mortuary or before the doctor well within 
time. Reaching of the dead body to the mortuary becomes further doubtful 
when Shabbir Ahmed 731-C (CW-1) stated that he reached to the hospital at 
02:30 p.m. Doctor has observed following four injuries on the person of 
deceased; 
 
INJURY NO.01:-  
Lacerated wound with irregular margins 02cm x 1.5 cm with everted margins on 
left side of chest 03.0 Cm medial to left nipple. There was no burning or 
blackening present on cloth or wound. Corresponding hole was present on clothes.  
Injury No. 1 was exit wound. 
INJURY NO.02:-  
Lacerated wound with everted margins 02 cm x 01.05 cm irregular in shape deep 
going on right side of abdomen below costal margin 3.00 cm lateral to mid line in 
midclavicular line. There was no burning and blackening on wound or clothes. 
Corresponding holes were present on clothes. injury No.02 was exit wound. 
 
INJURY NO.03:-  
Lacerated wound was 01.00 cm x 0.75 cm going deep on right side of abdomen 
in mid axillary line with inverted margins at the level of injury No.2. There was 
no burning or blackening on clothes or wound. Injury No.03 was entry wound. 
On exploration skin, muscles, blood vessel and nerves and liver damaged.  
 
 
INJURY NO.04:-  
A lacerated wound was 01.00 x 01.00 cm into deep going with inverted margins 
on back of left side of chest at scapular region. On exploration skin muscles 
damaged scapular fractured left lung, ruptured nerves and blood vessels damaged. 
Injury No.04 for entry wound. There was no burning blackening on injury No.04. 
 

7 
Crl.A.No.71 of 2022. 
 
Injuries No.1 & 2 on the chest and belly were mentioned by the doctor as 
exit wounds; thus, negating the ocular account. However, Injuries No. 3 & 4 
were referred by him as entry wounds; one on back at scapular region and 
other on right side of abdomen in mid auxiliary line which the learned 
counsel for the complainant tried to exploit but pictorial diagram shows it 
more clearly as on the flank. For reference an image of mid auxiliary line is 
reflected below.       
 
Diagram clearly shows that mid auxiliary line is in fact depicts the flank. If 
the accused/appellant had fired from the position as shown in the site plan 
then there could hardly be any chance to receive the injury on the flank with 
exit wound on the belly or at scapular region on the back with exit on the 
chest. If this fact is conceded that a living man could not be a static object 
and his movement can result in injury at any part of the body, then by all 
means injuries must have burning or blackening because same were caused 
from a very close range while standing in front of motorcycle of the 
deceased. Thus, prosecution story has many holes to fill in; like if the 
deceased was sitting on the motorcycle when received injury, then blood 
must have been dropped on said motor cycle but it has not been taken into 
possession and even some other injuries on the body due to his fall from 
motorcycle were also expected but they were missing. Doctor was cross-
examined on this aspect by the complainant’s counsel that in order to extend 
favour to the prosecution he has changed the nature of injuries which was 
denied by him and so much so complainant or prosecution has not challenged 
postmortem report or opinion of doctor at any stage during the investigation. 
This contradiction in ocular and medical evidence leads to the conclusion 
that witnesses were not present at the place of occurrence. “MUHAMMAD 
IDREES and another Versus The STATE and others” (2021 SCMR 612) and 

8 
Crl.A.No.71 of 2022. 
 
such contradiction also helps to draw an inference that as a matter of fact the 
prosecution witnesses were not truthful in their stance and were not present 
at the place of occurrence at the relevant time and had not witnessed the 
occurrence. Reliance in this regard is placed on the cases “MUHAMMAD 
ASHRAF alias ACCHU versus The STATE” (2019 SCMR 652) and “ZAFAR 
Versus The STATE and others” (2018 SCMR 326). Investigating Officer 
(CW-7) while responding to cross-examination conducted by the 
complainant’s counsel stated that doctor has wrongly changed the nature of 
injuries otherwise, he has observed injuries on the chest and belly with 
smaller size but he admitted in cross-examination that he had not asked the 
doctor for clarification of such anomaly, if any. CW-7 probably is not 
speaking the truth because perusal of inquest report and injury statement 
clearly show that Investigating Officer has not mentioned the wounds as 
entry or exit in any manner, which they usually do while mentioning as  
"داخلہ و خارجہ" however, his mala-fide is further reflected from the 
interpolation in inquest report and the injury statement wherein injury No.4 
was added later with different writing and ink which means that such injury 
was added after postmortem examination. In addition to this contradiction, 
he has also changed the inter-se distance between accused/appellant and the 
deceased by making it as 06-feet because doctor has not observed any 
burning or blackening in the injuries which were expected in the situation 
when fires were made from a very close range. Claim of complainant’s 
counsel that inter se distance is clearly and without any interpolation is 
mentioned in scaled site plan is outrightly rejected because it was prepared 
after one month and twenty-one days of occurrence. From the above 
situation, it is clear that Investigating Officer tried to distort the actual facts 
to complete the false story of prosecution.   
10. 
Motive behind the occurrence was the dispute of landed property 
between the accused and complainant party but no document showing any 
litigation between the parties was brought on record. Both the witnesses of 
ocular account and investigating officer CW-7 conceded that no such 
litigation was pending before any Court. PW-2 stated as follows; 

9 
Crl.A.No.71 of 2022. 
 
“During investigation we did not produce any witness regarding 
the motive claimed by us. we also did not produce any 
document in respect of the alleged motive.” 
Whereas investigating officer CW-7 during cross examination by the 
complainant’s counsel responded as follows; 
“The accused and complainant party are close relative interse. 
There was a dispute between the parties regarding landed 
property and it was the reason for this occurrence. However 
there was no record of court litigation till then.” 
 Thus, prosecution had not succeeded to establish the motive part of the 
occurrence. It is trite that though the prosecution is not required to prove 
motive in every case, yet the same, if set up, should be proved through 
independent source of evidence other than the words of mouth and in case 
of failure to do so, the prosecution should have faced the consequences and 
not the defence. Reliance is placed on cases reported as “PATHAN versus 
The STATE” (2015 SCMR 315) and NAVEED alias NEEDU and others 
versus The STATE and others” (2014 SCMR 1464). 
11. 
Site plan clearly speaks about nearby residences of accused persons 
on the northern side of place of occurrence, dera of Muhammad Nawaz PW-
2  on western side and on the southern side house of Mazhar Arian and vacant 
plots of Nawaz Khokhar and Ashraf Khokhar. In this case occurrence took 
place in front of house of Mazhar Arian who did not join the investigation as 
admitted by the complainant, and investigating officer had also not 
associated him into the investigation, therefore, most natural witness was 
skipped by the prosecution for the reasons best known to them which fact 
could be read against the prosecution.  
12. 
So far as recovery of pistol and its matching report is concerned, it has 
been observed that crime empties were deposited in the office of PFSA on 
09.04.2020, the day when accused was arrested, there is every possibility 
that crime empties were managed; therefore, PFSA matching report cannot 
be relied upon; reliance is on case reported as “MUHAMMAD ASHRAF alias 
ACCHU Versus The STATE” (2019 SCMR 562); pistol was shown recovered 
later, which is also not believable in the sense that when CW-7 had visited 
the place of occurrence, family members of the accused were present and in 

10 
Crl.A.No.71 of 2022. 
 
their presence accused got recovered pistol, therefore, pistol was in his  
exclusive knowledge or possession of the appellant. In the circumstances, 
there are clouds on sending crime empties well in time, recovery of pistol 
too was not from exclusive possession, therefore, the prosecution case fails 
on this evidence as well which cannot be believed in any manner.  
13. 
On the basis of similar evidence, co-accused Muhammad Hussain 
was acquitted of the charge which in turn rules out even his presence at 
the spot, therefore, similar facts cannot be believed on the same set of 
evidence against the appellant and principle of falsus in uno falsus in 
omnibus is somewhat with slight change is applicable in this case, 
therefore, acquittal of co-accused can be read a factor setting clouds on 
the prosecution story. 
14.    Objection on the other side that cross examination of witnesses in this 
case was too short to shatter the whole case-evidence, and the important 
aspects in favour of prosecution, which skipped notice of, should be read as 
a support to the charge. It is pertinent to mention that the cross examination 
should always be brief and to the point; practice of prolonged cross 
examination has been deprecated by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case 
reported as“MUHAMMAD SHAFI and 2 others  versus THE STATE” (PLD 
1967 Supreme Court 167) with following observation; 
There is a regrettable practice among a class of lawyers to use 
prolonged cross-examination for the purpose of leading a witness 
into error after his alertness has been reduced through fatigue and 
his resistance to suggestions made in the form of leading 
questions has thereby been reduced. Such a practice is plainly 
designed not for the disclosure of truth, but for the manipulation 
of error, and we take this opportunity of expressing our entire 
disapproval of the use of such methods.  
Above observation was reiterated in case reported as “MUDDASSAR alias 
JIMMI versus THE STATE” (1996 SCMR 3).  
           Before embarking upon what has been asked in cross examination in 
this case, let’s have a glance how examination of a witness proceeds during 
the trial. In an adversarial criminal justice system, there are two parties in 
contest, i.e., Prosecution and Defence. Examination of witness, by the party 
who calls him/her, is called examination-in-chief or direct examination. 

11 
Crl.A.No.71 of 2022. 
 
Examination of that witness by opposite party is called cross examination 
and any question subsequent to cross examination by the party who calls the 
witness is called re-examination or re-direct.  All three stages of examination 
hardly had any time-lag, therefore, any party who does not come froward to 
question the witness on a day, the alternate arrangement should be made 
because examination of a witness is a sacred business which cannot be 
lingered on so as to jeopardize it through intrigues, mechanicians or invented 
treacherous plans to kneel down or pressurize the witness. Even frequent 
appearance of witness in Court for giving evidence in piecemeal, not only 
derail the true facts due to fading of memory or other reasons but also had a 
bad impact on the economy of witness who had to earn bread for his family. 
It is for that reason usually actual witnesses do not come forward to help 
improve the quality of evidence. The Judge must understand this social 
problem. If he thinks that defence counsel is not ready to cross examine the 
witness, a heavy cost be imposed which is called an “adjournment cost”, 
fully covered under section 344 of Cr.P.C. Reliance is on case reported as 
“MUHAMMAD SHAHID YOUSAF Versus The STATE and others” (2022 
MLD 1331) or to provide counsel on state expenses but not to struck off the 
right of cross examination; reliance is on case reported as “SHER HASSAN 
and others Versus GUL HASSAN KHAN and others” (2022 SCMR 1360). 
Similarly, if the lawyers are observing strike or the complainant’s counsel 
seeks time, even then Court is required to move forward with measures 
suggested in a case reported as “SHAHBAZ AKMAL Verus The STATE 
through Prosecutor General Punjab, Lahore and another” (2023 SCMR 
421). Court must have a close eye on the cross examination of witness and 
if the Counsel on State expenses cannot do the job properly, judge should 
cross examine the witness; reliance is on cases reported as “Dikson v. 
Emperor” (AIR 1942 Pat. 90); “NAZIR HUSSAIN versus The STATE” 
(PLJ 1986 Cr.C. (Lah.) 120); “Khadija Begum v. Nisar Ahmad” (AIR 1936 
Lah. 887). If on such measures of a Judge, the advocate concerned retaliates 
with a behaviour which attracts misconduct or professional misconduct, it 
can well be reported to the High Court for an action under Section 54 (2) of 
the Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils Act, 1973. The Judge and an 
advocate are for the system to strive for search of truth; both should re-think 

12 
Crl.A.No.71 of 2022. 
 
and re-define their conduct to contribute in the system, and this is high time 
to stand synchronized with the international best practices which help to 
recognize their proper and vital roles. Judges should not work for gain or 
appreciation; it is a divine duty and its efficient performance always finds a 
support from the audience, even in the form of a one man’s feedback and it 
is learnt through age and experience that feedback is a gift; so, work, work 
and work, and win the gift.   
15.      Coming back to conducting of cross examination; we know 
questioning is a technique, it is not like brandishing a Sabre but learning to 
handle a scalpel; examination of witness must be structured that can be in 
the form of a one line of transcript of each question, which means “one fact 
in one question”, because composite question creates misunderstanding and 
annoyance to witness and the Judge. Defence Counsel must know his 
objective with every witness and should never ask a question to which he 
does not know the answer and his examination should be like as 
conversational as he can. Counsel must develop the habit of riding the 
bumps, which means that he must be patient, cool and calm if an unexpected 
reply of a witness has disturbed him. 
             There are some basic approaches to cross examination which lay 
down some rules in this respect. If somebody want guidance on the way that 
successful cross-examinations have operated in the past then go to Art of 
Cross-examination by Francis Wellman (Collier-Macmillan, 1962) and to 
The Art of the Advocacy by Richard Du Cann (Penguin, 3rd edition, 1982). 
Read the memoirs of the great advocates. Read the reports of famous trials 
because every person has its own technique of asking question. One may not 
agree with the technique of others because they get the required results and 
continue on it with pride. However, there are three major rules of cross-
examination. General Rule, Specific Rule, Cautionary Rule and Mandatory 
Rule of putting your case.  
General Rules.  
(1) ‘Be as kind as you can’; in this way you can win the sympathy of judge 
and also put the witness on ease to extract required information; therefore, 
technique of “Pitch, Pause & Pace” (PPP) would well work to achieve your 
objective. (2) ‘Ask question in a spirit of inquiry’ which means gentle and 

13 
Crl.A.No.71 of 2022. 
 
inquiring approach as not flatly to contradict a witness but to persuade him 
to change his view point. (3) ‘Expect no help from the witness’ throws light 
that you must go prepared while cross examining the witness with Plan-A 
& Plan-B, because it’s like ‘fishing trip’ and every time you cannot catch 
the fish; sometime you don’t get the required results, therefore, you must 
aim to achieve a specific purpose to every question.  
 
 Specific Rules 
(1) ‘Stick to the ‘one line’ question as much as you can; keep asking short 
questions which allow specific and short answer. Don’t ask open question 
starting from words “what, when, where, why, how” because it invites long 
reply and also losing control on witness. (2) Avoid the multiple question; 
ask only one question at a time and rephrase if witness does not get it. (3) 
Aim for precision; aim for exactness in your questions. Mentally break 
down what it is you are after.  
 
 
Cautionary Rules. 
(1) Don’t ask the question to which you don’t know the answer (2) Don’t 
suddenly draw back with a start; which means if you are landed at wrong 
place, don’t withdraw abruptly rather move back slowly. (3) Ride the 
bumps (as explained above) 
The mandatory rule of putting your case. 
This portion of cross examination is usually in the form of suggestions to 
raise questions on the facts adversely affecting the accused’ case, so that 
later if evidence is required to be given to diffuse the effect of those facts, 
he must have justification for it.   
 
The cross examination conducted by the learned counsel for the accused was 
almost based upon above rules and also perfect in the light of direction 
passed by the Supreme Court in cases cited supra.   
16. 
 Considering all the pieces of evidence in this case and for what has 
been discussed above, I have no doubt to hold that here in this case the 
prosecution has failed miserably to establish the charge against the accused 
beyond any shadow of doubt. In the case “NAJAF ALI SHAH versus The 
STATE” (2021 SCMR 736) Supreme Court of Pakistan has held that for 
giving benefit of doubt to an accused a single circumstance creating 
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about guilt of accused is sufficient to 
make him entitled to such benefit. Reliance is also on the cases reported as 
“AMIR MUHAMMAD KHAN Versus The STATE” (2023 SCMR 566), 
“SARFRAZ and another Versus The STATE” (2023 SCMR 670), “Mst. 
HAJIRA BIBI alias SEEMA and others Versus ABDUL QASEEM and 
another” (2023 SCMR 870), “BASHIR MUHAMMAD KHAN versus The 

14 
Crl.A.No.71 of 2022. 
 
STATE” (2022 SCMR 986) and “KHALID MEHMOOD alias KHALOO 
Versus The STATE” (2022 SCMR 1148). Here in this case as discussed above 
the prosecution has squarely failed to bring home the guilt against the 
appellant. Consequently, the criminal appeal is allowed, the impugned 
judgment of conviction and sentence is set-aside and the accused/appellant 
is acquitted of the charge against him. He shall be released forthwith if not 
required in any other case. The case property, if any, be disposed of in 
accordance with law and the record of the learned trial court be sent back 
immediately.
