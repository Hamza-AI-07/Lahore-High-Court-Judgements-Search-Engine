Criminal Revision No.36862 of 2021 
 
 
Benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C. was, however, extended to 
the appellants. 
 
Challenging their conviction and sentence, the appellants filed 
Criminal Appeal No.33345 of 2021, whereas the complainant-
Muhammad Akram (PW.1) filed Criminal Revision No.36862 of 2021 
seeking enhancement of sentence awarded to the afore-mentioned 
convicts. Both these matters are being adjudicated through this 
consolidated judgment.  
2. 
Briefly stated the facts of the prosecution case as unveiled by 
the complainant Muhammad Akram (PW.1) in FIR (Exh.CW.6/A) are 
that he is resident of Chak No.176/RB Panwan and labourer by 
profession. On 23.12.2017 at about 10:30 a.m.  a small trivial took 
place between his brother Muhammad Ramzan and Waheed Ahsan 
son of Muhammad Nazir with accused Javed Iqbal  over the 
possession of the public pond. His brother Muhammad Ramzan and 
Waheed Ahsan forbade Javed Iqbal accused from taking possession of 
public pond through police upon which Javed Iqbal nourished a 
grudge. At about 4:30 p.m., Javed Iqbal accused was instigating his 
co-accused namely Shehbaz Ramay, Haji Irshad and Sajjad Haider 
while being present at Addah Panwan that Muhammad Ramzan and 
Waheed Ahsan be killed, whereas this conversation was heard by 
Muhammad Tanvir and Shahid Bashir PWs. At about 5:00 p.m., the 
complainant along with Muhammad Ramzan, Asghar Ali, Waheed  
Ahsan and Jameel was going to Adda Panwan from their home and 
Muhammad Ramzan was ahead of them. When they reached the 
Chowk of Master Barkat Ali they saw that from the eastern side, 
accused Shahbaz, Sajjad Haider, Javed Iqbal all armed with 
Kalashnikovs, Muhammad Irshad armed with .244 bore rifle, Ali and 
Ashfaq alias Bao armed with guns .12 bore along with four unknown 
accused equipped with firearm weapons rushed towards them. Javed 
Iqbal accused raised Lalkara that they be taught a lesson for creating a 
hindrance in taking possession of government pond, upon which 
accused Shehbaz fired a straight shot with his Kalashnikov upon 
Muhammad Ramzan which hit at his face below the right nostril and 

3 
Criminal Appeal No.33345 of 2021 & 
Criminal Revision No.36862 of 2021 
 
 
he being  injured fell down. Irshad accused fired shot from his .244 
rifle upon Waheed Ahsan which hit at his right knee, due to which he 
became injured and fell down. Irshad accused made indiscriminate 
firing upon Waheed Ahsan but fortunately the bullets did not hit him. 
Muhammad Ramzan succumbed to the injuries at the spot. All the 
accused retreated back to the different Chowks while resorting to 
firing. Accused continued indiscriminate firing in different Chowks 
for 15 to 20 minutes while creating fear and insecurity. Due to the 
firing of accused, one Hameedan Bibi wife of Anayat Ali also 
sustained firearm injuries. Upon hearing the noise of firing, Tanvir 
Ahmad, Shahid Rasheed and many other persons of the vicinity 
attracted to the spot and witnessed the occurrence. Javed Iqbal 
accused made continuous firing at the spot and remained instigating 
co-accused prior to the occurrence for murder of Muhammad Ramzan.  
3. 
 The proceedings in this case were initiated upon the written 
application (Exh.PA) submitted by the complainant, Muhammad 
Akram (PW.1) before Muhammad Shehzad 953/HC (CW.6) at Police 
Station Saddar Shahkot, which led to the registration of FIR 
No.561/2017 (Exh.CW.6/A). The investigation was initially assigned 
to Saifullah Niazi SI (CW.7) who on 23.12.2017 visited THQ 
Hospital Shahkot at about 7:15 p.m., prepared inquest report 
(Exh.CW.7/A), injury statement (Exh.CW.8/A), application for 
postmortem examination (Exh.CW.4/A) and handed over the dead 
body of Muhammad Ramzan to Asad Ali 1314/C for autopsy. 
Thereafter, he visited the crime scene and prepared a rough site plan 
(Exh.CW.10/A). From the spot, he secured blood stained soil (P.4), 
thirty empties of Kalashnikov (P.1/1-30), 8 empties of .244 bore 
(P.2/1-8), 20 empties of .12 bore gun (P.3/1-20) vide memo Exh.PE. 
On 27.12.2017 he went to Allied Hospital Faisalabad and recorded 
statement of injured Hameedan Bibi under Section 161 Cr.P.C. On 
30.12.2017 injured namely Waheed Ahsan (PW.2) joined the 
investigation before him and his statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C. 
was recorded. On 02.01.2018 he received Robkar of accused 
Muhammad Shehbaz regarding the protective bail granted by Lahore 

4 
Criminal Appeal No.33345 of 2021 & 
Criminal Revision No.36862 of 2021 
 
 
High Court and on 11.01.2018 he arranged confrontal meetings of the 
complainant and accused which was entered in dairy diary No.16 on 
13.01.2018. Subsequently upon the transfer of Saifullah Niazi SI 
(CW.7), the task of investigation was assigned to Arif Ali Inspector 
(CW.8) on 26.01.2018, who deferred the arrest of accused Javed 
Iqbal, Sajjad Haider and Ali Ashraf, out of them during investigation 
former two accused were found not involved with the occurrence. On 
06.02.2018 the complainant Muhammad Akram (PW.1) produced 
accused Muhammad Shehbaz, Muhammad Ashfaq and Muhammad 
Arshad before him and on the same day their arrest was incorporated 
in the instant case. On 18.02.2018 the appellants Muhammad Irshad 
and Muhammad Shehbaz during interrogation made separate 
disclosures and in pursuance thereof led to the recovery of .244 bore 
rifle (P.8) and Kalashnikov (P.9) which were taken  into possession 
through memos Exh.CW.14/A & Exh.CW.16/A respectively. Arif Ali 
Inspector (CW.8) also performed the steps towards the completion of 
investigation of other accused and after complying all the codal 
formalities submitted report under Section 173 Cr.P.C.  
4. 
Being dissatisfied with the conduct of the investigation, the 
complainant, Muhammad Akram (PW.1), filed a private complaint  
which led to the trial. During the proceedings, the prosecution 
produced six witnesses. Among them, Muhammad Akram (PW.1), the 
injured Muhammad Waheed Ahsan (PW.2) and Muhammad Asghar 
(PW.3) provided the ocular account of the incident. The trial court 
also examined eight CWs, out of them, Dr.Majid Saleem (CW.4) on 
24.12.2017 conducted the postmortem examination of the deceased 
Muhammad Ramzan and issued postmortem report along with 
pictorial diagrams (Exh.CW.4/A & Exh.CW.4/A/1), Dr.Mubashar 
Rafique (CW.5) on 23.12.2017 at about 6:45 p.m. conducted the 
medico legal examination of injured Waheed Ahsan and issued his 
MLC (Exh.CW.5/A), while Saif Ullah Niazi SI (CW.7) and Arif Ali 
Inspector (CW.8) investigated the case. Upon the closure of the 
prosecution’s evidence, the trial court recorded the statements of the 
appellants along with their co-accused under Section 342 Cr.P.C., 

5 
Criminal Appeal No.33345 of 2021 & 
Criminal Revision No.36862 of 2021 
 
 
confronting them with the incriminating material. The appellants 
denied the allegations, claimed their innocence, and asserted false 
implication. They neither chose to get recorded statements under 
Section 340(2) Cr.P.C., nor did they produce any defence evidence. 
Upon conclusion of the trial, the court convicted and sentenced the 
appellants as stated above, hence the instant criminal appeal and 
criminal revision. 
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
6. 
A careful examination of the record reveals that the instant case 
arises out of an incident which took place on 23.12.2017 at about 5:00 
p.m. in the locality known as Panwan, situated eight kilometers away 
from Police Station Saddar Shahkot, District Nankana Sahib. As 
narrated in the FIR (Exh.CW.6/A), Muhammad Shehbaz, the 
appellant, allegedly fired a shot from his Kalashnikov, striking the 
deceased Muhammad Ramzan beneath the nostril and causing him to 
collapse and die at the spot. It is further alleged that another appellant, 
Irshaad, fired a shot from his .244 bore rifle, which hit Waheed Ahsan 
(PW.2) on his right knee, causing him to fall. Additionally, 
Mst.Hameedan Bibi is said to have suffered injuries as a result of the 
firing made by the accused. The record also shows that the 
complainant Muhammad Akram (PW.1) informed the police of the 
occurrence through a written application (Exh.PA) which he handed 
over to Muhammad Shehzad, Head Constable (CW.6), at Police 
Station Saddar Shahkot about two and a half hours after the incident. 
On this basis, learned counsel for the complainant argued that the 
prompt reporting of the occurrence left little room for fabrication or 
the development of a false narrative. Conversely, learned defence 
counsel maintained that the incident was not reported to the police in 
the manner alleged by the prosecution and that the record had been 
manipulated to create such an impression. In order to reach a 
conclusion capable of inspiring judicial confidence, I scrutinized the 
record with utmost care and found merit in the submissions advanced 
by learned defence counsel. Notably, it is on record that Waheed 
Ahsan (PW.2), who allegedly sustained a firearm injury during the 

6 
Criminal Appeal No.33345 of 2021 & 
Criminal Revision No.36862 of 2021 
 
 
incident, was transported to THQ Hospital, Shahkot, where he was 
examined by Dr.Mubashar Rafique (CW.5) on 23.12.2017 at about 
6:45 p.m. The complainant, Muhammad Akram (PW.1) during trial 
stated that he accompanied the injured Waheed Ahsan (PW.2) to the 
hospital in an ambulance, and that the distance from the place of 
occurrence to the hospital, connected by a metaled road, could be 
covered within 10 to 15 minutes. During cross-examination, he also 
admitted that Police Station Saddar Shahkot lies on the same route 
and is located on the main road. Owing to the importance of this 
aspect, the relevant extract from the cross-examination of Muhammad 
Akram (PW.1) is reproduced below:- 
 “It is correct that in order to reach from the place of occurrence to 
the hospital first PS Saddar, Shahkot comes on the way which is on 
the main road. It takes 10 to 12 minutes on motorbike in reaching 
from the place of occurrence to the police station.”  
 
Furthermore, although all three eyewitnesses, including the 
injured witness, admitted that they possessed mobile phones, yet they 
asserted that their phones were not with them at the relevant time but 
this justification seems to be implausible. Be that as it may, since the 
complainant Muhammad Akram (PW.1) conceded during cross-
examination that he alone accompanied the injured witness in the 
ambulance the matter could easily be reported to the police by 
Muhammad Asghar (PW.3), who was not accompanying the 
complainant or the deceased. Similarly, it is repellent to common 
sense that when the complainant Muhammad Akram (PW.1) reached 
the hospital along with the deceased Muhammad Ramzan and injured 
Muhammad Waheed Ahshan (PW.2), why he delayed the conveying 
of information to the police especially when the distance between the 
hospital and the police station could be covered within 10 to 12 
minutes on a motorbike. Moreover, Muhammad Akram (PW.1) also 
stated during cross-examination that he got the written complaint 
(Exh.PA) drafted from an unknown individual but his identity never 
surfaced either during investigation or at trial.  
 
In addition to above, I am also aware of the fact that the inquest 
report prepared under Rule 35 of Chapter XXV of the Police Rules, 

7 
Criminal Appeal No.33345 of 2021 & 
Criminal Revision No.36862 of 2021 
 
 
1934, is a detailed 34-column form completed at the start of a murder 
investigation. It includes key information gathered from eyewitnesses, 
examination of the dead body, and inspection of the crime scene. The 
report gives a complete picture of the incident, such as the distance 
between the crime scene and the place where the police was informed, 
details and identifying features of the deceased, the condition of the 
body, the injuries found, the suspected weapon, and any items found 
near the body if it was not moved. A short summary of how the 
incident happened is also included. Its importance is highlighted by 
the rule that all this information must be shared with the medical 
officer before the autopsy. These steps act as safeguards to prevent 
any foul play and ensure that eyewitness statements are properly 
recorded before the postmortem begins. Therefore, the medical officer 
must sign each page of the inquest report as acknowledgment of its 
receipt before beginning the postmortem examination. This 
requirement ensures that, prior to the autopsy, the eyewitness 
statements, details of the weapon used, and the locations of the 
injuries inflicted by the accused are already on record with the police, 
thereby preventing any possibility of later tampering. Reliance is 
placed upon the case reported as Hafeez Ahmed and others v. The 
State and others (2023 YLR 2503) wherein the learned Division 
Bench of this Court while dealing with the importance of signing the 
inquest report by the medical officer held as under:- 
“The medical officer is required to sign each page of the inquest 
report as token of its receipt before the commencement of postmortem 
examination. Needless to mention here that the requirements so 
mentioned above are primarily focused at ensuring that before the 
commencement of autopsy statements of eyewitnesses are on file, the 
kind of weapon used in the crime and locales of injuries inflicted by 
accused have been conveyed to police so as to exclude the possibility 
of subsequent tampering.” 
 
Reverting to the record of the present case, it is noticeable that none of 
the four pages of the inquest report (Exh.CW.7/A) bears the signatures 
of the doctor. It is indeed astonishing that, although the prosecution 
asserts 
that 
the 
application 
for 
post-mortem 
examination 
(Exh.CW.4/A) was submitted to the medical officer by Saifullah SI 

8 
Criminal Appeal No.33345 of 2021 & 
Criminal Revision No.36862 of 2021 
 
 
(CW.7), however neither Saifullah SI (CW.7) nor Dr.Majid Saleem 
(CW.5) recorded the date on its submission beneath their respective 
signatures. Furthermore, the inquest report does not mention the FIR 
number. These deficiencies clearly indicate that the inquest report 
(Exh.CW.7/A) and the autopsy application (Exh.CW.4/A) were not 
delivered to the medical officer prior to the post-mortem examination. 
The defence counsel, fully conscious of the significance of these 
inconsistencies, cross-examined Dr.Majid Saleem (CW.5), yet no 
satisfactory legal explanation emerged. Given the substantial 
importance of these irregularities, I find it appropriate to reproduce 
the relevant portion of the cross-examination of Dr.Majid Saleem 
(CW.5), which is as under:- 
“It is correct that upon complaint for registration of the case, FIR, 
injury statement of the deceased Muhammad Ramzan as well as on 
inquest report of the deceased, my signatures are not available. It is 
correct that no number of FIR is mentioned on postmortem 
examination of the deceased. It is correct that I endorsed only those 
documents which were produced before me at the time of postmortem 
examination. As soon as I received the documents, I without any 
delay on my part, conducted postmortem examination of the deceased 
Muhammad Ramzan.”  
 
Furthermore as per the inquest report (Exh.CW.7/A), the police 
received information about the occurrence on 23.12.2017 at around 
7:15 p.m., and the dead body at the THQ Hospital was identified by 
Muhammad Ashiq (given-up PW) and Muhammad Nazir (PW.5). The 
fact that these individuals, rather than the complainant Muhammad 
Akram (PW.1) or any other eyewitness identified the deceased leads 
this Court to conclude that neither the complainant nor any other 
eyewitness was present at the spot. A reasonable inference in this 
regard is that had they actually been present at the time of occurrence, 
they would themselves have identified the dead body. Similarly, 
Saifullah Niazi SI (CW.7) during cross-examination admitted that at 
the time of his visit at THQ Hospital, Shahkot neither the complainant 
nor any other witness met him and he completed the inquest report in 
the presence of Muhammad Ashiq and Muhammad Nazir. Since this 
is an important aspect, hence the relevant excerpts from the cross-
examination of Saifullah Niazi SI (CW.7) are reproduced hereunder:- 

9 
Criminal Appeal No.33345 of 2021 & 
Criminal Revision No.36862 of 2021 
 
 
“I reached THQ Hospital Shahkot. Complainant of this case did not 
meet me at said hospital. Similarly, no eyewitness met me in the said 
hospital. It is correct that I prepared all my documents in THQ 
Hospital where the corpse was present including inquest report…… 
I completed inquest report in the presence of Muhammad Ashiq and 
Muhammad Nazir. The above mentioned witnesses are only the 
witness of identification of dead body. The above mentioned 
witnesses did not claim themselves to be eyewitnesses of 
occurrence.” 
 
This Court is mindful of the fact that the delay in the registration of 
the FIR (CW.6/A) is merely two and a half hours, and in certain 
situations such a delay may carry little weight. However, in the 
context of the present case, the delay assumes considerable 
significance, as it may reasonably be attributed to consultation, 
seeking instructions, and the deliberate preparation of the first 
information report. In this context reference may be made to the case 
reported as Abdul Ghafoor v. The State (2022 SCMR 1527) wherein 
the Supreme Court of Pakistan held as under:- 
“This Court while holding that the delay of two hours in lodging 
the FIR has assumed great significance as the same can be 
attributed to consultation, taking instructions and calculatedly 
preparing the report keeping the names of the accused open for 
roping in such persons whom ultimately the prosecution may wish 
to implicate charge and put to trial.” 
 
7. 
Before proceeding further, it is important to note that in the FIR 
(Exh.CW.6/A), in addition to the appellants Muhammad Shehbaz and 
Muhammad Irshad, four named and four unknown accused were 
alleged to have reached the crime scene armed with firearms of 
various bores. It is further observed that, during the investigation, two 
of the named accused Javed Iqbal and Sajjad Haider were not found 
involved. Nonetheless, they along with two other co-accused, Ashfaq 
and Muhammad Ali Ashraf, were tried in a private complaint filed by 
the complainant, Muhammad Akram (PW.1), and were ultimately 
acquitted. Although the complainant challenged their acquittal 
through PSLA No.35511 of 2021 but it was dismissed on merits on 
07.03.2022, and that order admittedly was never assailed before the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan. As a result, the acquittal of the 
aforementioned four accused has attained finality. Moreover, the 
identities of the four unknown co-accused remained mystery both 

10 
Criminal Appeal No.33345 of 2021 & 
Criminal Revision No.36862 of 2021 
 
 
during the investigation and at the trial stage. In view of the acquittal 
of the co-accused who were specifically named in the FIR and 
assigned distinct roles, the central question which arises is whether, on 
the same set of evidence, the conviction and sentence of the present 
appellants can still be upheld. In addressing this issue, this Court bears 
a great responsibility to scrutinize the evidence with utmost care, 
requiring that the ocular account be strongly supported by other 
evidence of unimpeachable quality. Reference in this regard is made 
to the case reported as Altaf Hussain v. The State (2019 SCMR 274) 
wherein the Supreme Court of Pakistan gave the following 
observation:- 
“It is well settled by now that if a set of witnesses is disbelieved to 
the extent of some accused the same cannot be believed to the 
extent of remaining accused facing the same trial without there 
being any independent and strong corroboration.” 
 
8. 
The circumstances outlined in the preceding paragraph 
compelled this Court to examine the ocular evidence furnished by the 
complainant Muhammad Akram (PW.1), Muhammad Waheed Ahsan 
(PW.2), and Muhammad Asghar (PW.3) with utmost care and 
caution. Among them, Muhammad Waheed Ahsan (PW.2), who 
admittedly was a constable and serving as Naib Court in Lahore High 
Court Lahore, claimed to have sustained a firearm injury on his right 
knee, and the prosecution portrayed this injury as confirmation of the 
truthfulness of his testimony. While I acknowledge that an eyewitness 
who suffers harm during a murder incident is generally considered to 
have been present at the crime scene, yet such injury does not 
constitute conclusive proof of the veracity of his statement. Even the 
testimony of an injured eyewitness must be evaluated according to the 
established principles governing the assessment of evidence before the 
conviction can be recorded. The notion that an injured witness rarely 
lies may hold some weight in cases involving a single accused, but it 
becomes an overgeneralization where multiple assailants are 
implicated. It would therefore be unjust to base the conviction solely 
on the statement of an injured witness without subjecting his evidence 
to rigorous scrutiny to determine its reliability. Reference can be made 

11 
Criminal Appeal No.33345 of 2021 & 
Criminal Revision No.36862 of 2021 
 
 
to the case reported as Amin Ali v. The State (2011 SCMR 323) 
wherein the Supreme Court of Pakistan observed as under:- 
“Certainly, the presence of injured witnesses cannot be doubted at 
the place of incident, but the question is as to whether they are 
truthful witnesses or otherwise, because merely the injuries on the 
person of P.Ws. would not stamp them truthful witnesses.” 
 
In another case reported as Nazir Ahmad v. Muhammad Iqbal and 
another (2011 SCMR 527), the Supreme Court of Pakistan while 
examining the case of an injured witness held as under:- 
“It is settled law that injuries of PWs are only indication of his presence 
at the spot but are not affirmative proof of his credibility and truth. See 
Said Ahmed’s case (1981 SCMR 795) and Muhammad Pervez’s case 
(2007 SCMR 670).” 
 
It is further observed by this Court that according to the 
prosecution, the first Investigating Officer, Saifullah Niazi SI (CW.7), 
reached THQ Hospital, Shahkot on 23.12.2017 at about 7:15 p.m., 
where he prepared the inquest report (Exh.CW-7/A), the injury 
statement of the deceased Muhammad Ramzan (Exh.CW-8/A), and 
the application for post-mortem examination (CW-4/A). He thereafter 
handed over the dead body of the deceased Muhammad Ramzan to 
Asad Ali 1314/C for its transfer from the Emergency Department to 
the morgue for autopsy. However, it is noteworthy that Saifullah Niazi 
SI (CW.7) did not prepare any injury statement in respect of the 
injured Muhammad Waheed Ahsan (PW.2). Moreover, during the 
spot inspection, he secured bloodstained cotton only from the place 
where the deceased Muhammad Ramzan had fallen, and failed to 
collect any blood from the location where Muhammad Waheed Ahsan 
(PW.2) had received his injury. Additionally, the bloodstained trouser 
(shalwar) was produced by the complainant himself before Arif Ali 
Inspector (CW.8) on 07.02.2018, approximately two months and 
fourteen days after the incident. From the perusal of record, it is 
evident that the incident took place on 23.12.2017, yet the statement 
of Muhammad Waheed Ahsan (PW.2) under Section 161 Cr.P.C. was 
not recorded until 30.12.2017. The prosecution attempted to justify 
this delay of nearly seven days by attributing it to the allegedly critical 

12 
Criminal Appeal No.33345 of 2021 & 
Criminal Revision No.36862 of 2021 
 
 
medical condition of PW.2. However, the record shows that he was 
brought to THQ Hospital, Shahkot, on the same day of the incident 
and was examined by Dr.Mubashir Rafique (PW.5) at about 6:45 
p.m., who issued the MLC (Exh.CW.5/A). I have minutely examined 
MLC (Exh.CW.5/A) and found it to be a fabricated document, as at 
the time Dr.Mubashar Rafique (CW.5) conducted the medico legal 
examination of Muhammad Waheed Ahsan (PW.2), no police official 
or private person was present and the medico legal examination was 
held without any court order. The MLC (Exh.CW.5/A) is also silent 
qua the time of admission and his discharge from THQ Hospital, 
Shahkot and in this regard the relevant columns were kept blank. In 
such situation, I consider it appropriate to reproduce the relevant 
portion of the cross-examination of Dr.Mubashar Rafique (CW.5) 
which is as follows:- 
“I have not mentioned the name of any constable/police employees 
who has brought the injured/patient in THQ Hospital, Shahkot for 
medical checkup. I have also not mentioned any date of admission or 
any date of discharge in relevant column of MLC Exh.W.5/A.” 
 
Similarly, Muhammad Waheed Ahsan (PW.2) in his examination-in-
chief took the stance that he along with deceased Muhammad Ramzan 
was shifted to THQ Hospital Shahkot through ambulance and from 
there he was referred to Allied Hospital, Faisalabad. For advantage 
sake, this portion of the examination-in-chief of Muhammad Waheed 
Ahsan (PW.2) is mentioned hereunder:- 
“I along with Muhammad Ramzan shifted to THQ Hospital Shahkot 
by ambulance, from where I was then shifted to Allied Hospital 
Faisalabad.” 
 
However, Dr.Mubashar Rafique (CW.5) in his statement before the 
court did not mention a single word in support of the stance of 
Muhammad Waheed Ahsan (PW.2). Though Muhammad Waheed 
Ahsan (PW.2) during cross-examination stated that he produced 
documents pertaining to his admission and discharge from THQ 
Hospital as well as from Hospital Faisalabad, however the record of 
the case is silent in this regard. The complainant Muhammad Akram 
(PW.1) also failed to confirm whether he ever provided proof of the 

13 
Criminal Appeal No.33345 of 2021 & 
Criminal Revision No.36862 of 2021 
 
 
injured Waheed Ahsan’s admission or discharge from the hospital 
during the investigation, and acknowledged that he had not supplied 
any such record to his counsel when the private complaint was filed. 
The relevant portion of Muhammad Akram’s (PW.1) cross-
examination is reproduced below for reference:- 
“I did not give any proof of admission or discharge of our 
witnesses, namely Waheed Ahsan from the hospital to my counsel 
at the time of filing of private complaint.” 
 
It is further noticed that according to MLC (Exh.CW.5/A), 
Muhammad Waheed Ahsan (PW.2) was stable at the time of 
examination and narrated a brief history of having received a gunshot 
wound inflicted by eight persons. This leads to a crucial question that 
if Muhammad Waheed Ahsan (PW.2) was fully conscious when 
examined on 23.12.2017, why was his statement under Section 161 
Cr.P.C. deferred until 30.12.2017. The record further reveals that the 
Investigating Officer Saifullah Niazi SI (CW.7) had reached the 
hospital while Muhammad Waheed Ahsan (PW.2) was under 
treatment, but he made no attempt to record his statement. The 
unexplained delay in recording PW-2’s statement becomes even more 
significant in light of the fact that no satisfactory explanation was 
offered either during the trial or before this Court. Such an 
unexplained lapse invites serious doubt about the reliability of PW-2’s 
version. It raises the possibility that the actual culprits were initially 
unknown to him and that the appellants might have been implicated 
later through substitution. Even otherwise, the delay occasioned in 
recording 161 Cr.P.C. statement of PW.2 is more catastrophic for the 
prosecution keeping in view the fact that on the day of occurrence he 
was serving as Naib Court in Lahore High Court Lahore. Moreover, 
Muhammad Waheed Ahsan (PW.2) did not place on record any 
document showing that on the day of occurrence he was on leave. It is 
a well-established principle for evaluating the evidence that when two 
interpretations of a fact are possible, the one favouring the accused 
must be preferred. Even a delay of 2/3 days in recording the statement 
of an eyewitness of a homicide incident is deemed fatal if not properly 

14 
Criminal Appeal No.33345 of 2021 & 
Criminal Revision No.36862 of 2021 
 
 
explained. Therefore, in the absence of any legally acceptable 
justification, the testimony of such a witness cannot be relied upon. 
Reliance is placed on case reported as Bashir Muhammad Khan v. The 
State (2022 SCMR 986) wherein the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
observed as under:-  
“Delayed recording of statement of PW under section 161, Cr.P.C. 
reduces its value to nil unless and until it is explained rendering 
justiciable reasonings. Reliance is placed on the judgment reported 
as Abdul Khaliq v. The State (1996 SCMR 1553). This judgment 
was followed by this Court in another judgment reported as Noor 
Muhammad v. The State (2020 SCMR 1049) as also in an 
unreported judgment passed in Criminal Petition No. 537/2021. 
Keeping in view the conduct of the PWs, it would not be safe to 
only rely upon their statements to sustain conviction of the 
appellant and there must be some independent corroboration to the 
extent of his involvement in commission of the crime.”  
 
I have also scrutinized the testimonies of the complainant Muhammad 
Akram (PW.1) and Muhammad Asghar (PW.3) with utmost care and 
have arrived at the conclusion that they have failed to convincingly 
establish their presence at the scene of the crime. At the cost of 
repetition, it is observed that the complainant Muhammad Akram 
(PW.1) in his examination-in-chief claimed to be accompanying the 
deceased Muhammad Ramzan, Asghar Ali (PW.3), and Waheed 
Ahsan (PW.2) on their way to Adda Panwan when, upon reaching the 
Chowk of Master Barkat Ali, the appellants and their co-accused 
arrived there armed with various weapons, killed Muhammad 
Ramzan, and injured Muhammad Waheed Ahsan (PW.2). However, it 
has been observed that at the relevant time, Muhammad Akram 
(PW.1) was employed at Sphere Textile Mills, Feroze-Wattoan, and 
he also admitted that he had not mentioned any reason in his 
complaint (Exh.PA) for going to Adda Panwan. Furthermore, his 
residence is located at 12/13 houses away from the place of 
occurrence. Although Muhammad Akram (PW.1) stated during cross-
examination that he and the other witnesses could not rescue 
Muhammad Waheed Ahsan (PW.2) immediately because the accused 
continued firing for 20/25 minutes in different Chowks, however his 
stance did not find corroboration from other witnesses of ocular 
account because Muhammad Waheed Ahsan (PW.2) and Muhammad 

15 
Criminal Appeal No.33345 of 2021 & 
Criminal Revision No.36862 of 2021 
 
 
Asghar (PW.3) categorically deposed during cross-examination that 
firing continued for only 2/3 minutes. Upon the perusal of the 
testimony of the complainant Muhammad Akram (PW.1) several 
other discrepancies appear, as he admitted during cross-examination 
that Mst.Hameedan Bibi, who was injured during the incident, 
remained hospitalized, yet he was unable to specify the duration of her 
hospitalization. This Court has also observed that both the 
complainant Muhammad Akram (PW.1) and Muhammad Asghar 
(PW.3) are real brothers of the deceased Muhammad Ramzan. 
According to the prosecution, heavy firing occurred at the time of the 
incident, however, it is quite surprising that neither of these two PWs 
sustained even a minor injury. Additionally, being real brothers, it 
would be natural to expect that they would have attended to the 
deceased, in which case their clothes would likely have become 
stained with blood, yet no such bloodstained clothing was taken into 
possession during the investigation nor produced during the trial. 
Moreover, Dr.Majid Saleem (CW.4) stated in his examination-in-chief 
that during the postmortem examination he noted the deceased 
Muhammad Ramzan’s eyes were closed while his mouth was slightly 
open. This observation also undermines the prosecution’s claim that 
any eyewitness was present at the time of the incident.  Moreover, the 
complainant Muhammad Akram (PW.1) has stated that the dead body 
of Muhammad Ramzan and the injured PW.2 were shifted to THQ 
Hospital through Rescue-1122. However, no official from Rescue-
1122 was produced either during the investigation or at trial, nor were 
any officials of Rescue-1122 cited as witnesses in the FIR or in the 
private complaint. Given the significance of this aspect, the relevant 
portion of the cross-examination of Muhammad Akram (PW.1) is 
reproduced below:- 
“The officials of 1122 who rescued were not produced by me 
before the police. I have also not cited them as witnesses in my 
FIR or the complaint. I filed private complaint after about 03 
months of the occurrence i.e. on 21.03.2018.”  
 
This Court has further noted that Mst.Hameedan Bibi also sustained 
firearm injuries during the occurrence and her statement under Section 

16 
Criminal Appeal No.33345 of 2021 & 
Criminal Revision No.36862 of 2021 
 
 
161 Cr.P.C. was recorded by Saifullah Niazi SI (CW.7) on 
27.12.2017. In her statement recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C., 
injured Hameedan Bibi took the stance that she did not see the 
incident nor did she nominate any person of whose fire hit her. This 
fact was categorically admitted by Saifullah Niazi SI (CW.7) with the 
following words:- 
“I correctly recorded the statement of injured Hameedan Bibi without 
any addition or omission. Hameedan Bibi did not state in her 
statement that she had seen the occurrence herself. It is correct that 
Hameedan Bibi did not nominate any person of whose fire she 
received.”  
Though the complainant Muhammad Akram (PW.1) while filing 
private complaint (Exh.PC) cited Mst.Hameedan Bibi as a prosecution 
witness, however neither was she given up nor produced by the 
prosecution during trial. The prosecution’s failure to produce such an 
important witness leads this Court to the inevitable conclusion that, 
had she been examined during the trial, her testimony would not have 
supported the prosecution's version. In drawing this inference, the 
Court is guided by Illustration (g) of Article 129 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984, which provides as follows:- 
 
“129. Court may presume existence of certain facts. The Court 
may presume the existence of any fact, which it thinks 
likely to have happened, regard being had to the common 
course of natural events, human conduct and the public and 
private business, in their relation to the facts of the 
particular case. 
Illustrations 
The court may presume: 
(g) that evidence which could be and is not produced   
would, if produced, be unfavourable to the person who 
withholds it.” 
 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Muhammad Rafique, 
etc. v. State & others (PLJ 2011 Supreme Court 191) held as under:-  
“that if any party withholds the best piece of evidence then it can 
fairly be presumed that the party had some sinister motive behind 
it. The presumption under Article 129 (g) of Qanun-e-Shahadat 
Order can fairly be drawn that if PW would have been examined, 
his evidence would have been unfavourable to the prosecution”. 
 

17 
Criminal Appeal No.33345 of 2021 & 
Criminal Revision No.36862 of 2021 
 
 
In another case reported as Lal Khan v. The State (2006 SCMR 
1846), the Supreme Court while dealing with the omission of the 
prosecution in not producing a material witness held as under:- 
“The prosecution is certainly not required to produce a number of 
witnesses as the quality and not the quantity of the evidence is the 
rule but non-production of most natural and material witnesses of 
occurrence, would strongly lead to an inference of prosecutorial 
misconduct which would not only be considered a source of undue 
advantage for possession but also an act of suppression of material 
facts causing prejudice to the accused.”  
9. 
This Court has also noted that the medical evidence in this case 
was provided by Dr.Majid Saleem (CW.4) and Dr.Mubashar Rafique 
(CW.5). Dr.Majid Saleem conducted the postmortem examination of 
the deceased, Muhammad Ramzan, while Dr.Mubashar Rafique 
performed the medico-legal examination of the injured witness, 
Muhammad Waheed Ahsan (PW.2). According to Dr.Majid Saleem 
(CW.4), he carried out the post-mortem examination and issued the 
post-mortem report (Exh.CW-4/A). A review of this report shows that 
the examination took place at 3:50 a.m. on 24.12.2017. However, it 
does not mention the date and time when the body was received in the 
mortuary. This omission is significant, particularly in light of the 
statement of the complainant Muhammad Akram (PW.1) during 
cross-examination that the postmortem facility was only a 2/3-minute 
walk away. Despite this, the column titled “when brought: village, 
thana, district” was left blank by Dr.Majid Saleem (CW.4). 
Additionally, in the postmortem report (Exh.CW-4/A), Dr. Majid 
Saleem recorded the time and date of death as “according to police 
report: 23.12.2017 at about 7:15 p.m.” Yet, the FIR (Exh.CW-6/A) 
states that the incident occurred at about 5:00 p.m. This discrepancy 
shows that the time of death noted in the post-mortem report does not 
align with the FIR. Even if the Court accepts 5:00 p.m. as the time of 
death and compares it with the recorded time of the postmortem, an 
unexplained delay of about fourteen hours emerges. Such a delay is 
considered detrimental to the prosecution’s case, as it raises doubts 
about the credibility of the FIR and the accuracy of the details of the 
crime. After carefully examining the record, I find no valid 

18 
Criminal Appeal No.33345 of 2021 & 
Criminal Revision No.36862 of 2021 
 
 
explanation for the delay in providing the necessary police documents 
for the autopsy. In my view, this fourteen-hour gap appears to have 
been used to construct a fabricated version of events and to arrange 
the presence of witnesses. Reference in this context may be made to 
the case reported as Muhammad Ilyas v. Muhammad Abid alias Billa 
(2017 SCMR 54) wherein the Supreme Court of Pakistan gave the 
following observation:- 
“Post-mortem examination of the dead body of Muhammad Shahbaz 
deceased had been conducted after nine hours of the incident which 
again was a factor pointing towards a possibility that the time had been 
consumed by the local police and complainant party in procuring and 
planting eye-witnesses and cooking up a story for the prosecution.” 
 It is further noted that Dr.Majid Saleem (CW.4) observed two injuries 
on the body of the deceased, out of them injury No.1 was described as 
a punctured entry wound measuring 1 × 1 cm with inverted edges, 
located at the junction of the upper lip and right nostril, 1 cm to the 
right of the midline, while injury No.2 was exit punctured wound with 
everted edges. The doctor also observed blackening around the wound 
of injury No.1. As per the prosecution, this injury was caused by the 
appellant Muhammad Shehbaz with a shot fired from his 
Kalashnikov. However, the site-plan (Exh.CW-10/A) indicates that 
the appellant was positioned at a distance of six feet when he fired. 
This raises a significant question as to how blackening could appear 
on the wound of the deceased when, according to standard forensic 
principles, such blackening typically occurs only if a shot is fired from 
a distance of about one yard (i.e., three feet). This aspect is further 
reinforced by the doctor’s admission during cross-examination that 
blackening appears around a wound when the shot is fired from about 
one yard and that, if a weapon such as a Kalashnikov is discharged 
from that distance, the resulting injury would be more severe. Given 
the relevance of this issue, the pertinent portion of the cross-
examination of Dr.Majid Saleem (CW.4) is reproduced below:- 
“Blackening on an injury appears if the injury is caused from the 
distance of almost one yard. As regard injury No.1, possibility 
cannot be ruled out that if the weapon used is rifle or Kalashnikov 

19 
Criminal Appeal No.33345 of 2021 & 
Criminal Revision No.36862 of 2021 
 
 
and the fire is shot within the distance of one yard, injury can be 
more severe.” 
In case reported as Barkat Ali v. Muhammad Asif & Others (2007 
SCMR 1812), the Supreme Court of Pakistan, while relying on 
Modi’s medical jurisprudence which states that blackening around a 
wound caused by a weapon such as a Kalashnikov can only occur if 
the shot is fired from a distance of approximately four feet, held as 
follows:- 
"It is an admitted fact that eye witnesses had stated that the 
deceased was hit by the respondents at about 30-35 feet whereas 
according to the medical report, there was burning and blackening 
and is evident from the statement of PW.2, therefore, ocular 
account furnished by the two eye witnesses in not in consonance 
with the medical evidence which clearly contradicts the statements 
of the eye-witnesses. It is a settled law that blackening appears on 
the dead body in case the deceased has received injuries at a 
distance of 4 feet according to medical jurisprudence by Modi. It is 
a settled law that oral evidence cannot be accepted to the extent of 
its inconsistency with the medical evidence. See Mardan Ali's case 
1980 SCMR 889, Bagh Ali's case 1983 SCMR 1292, Sain Dad's 
case 1972 SCMR 74 and Zardshad case 1969 SCMR 644" 
Criminal Appeal No. 88-J of 2015 Muhammad Umar vs. The State 
& 2 others". 
Similarly, in case reported as Mian Sohail Ahmed and others v. The 
State and others (2019 SCMR 956), the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
held as under:- 
“Site-plan (Ex-PL) shows one of the appellants to be standing next 
to the driving seat of the car at a distance of 4 feet. A fire-shot 
from this distance is likely to cause blackening but the medical 
evidence (Post-mortem examination reports Ex-PM and Ex-PM/1 
and the statement of PW-10) does not support this, once again 
raising a suspicion that the events may have unfolded differently 
than as reported.” 
 
In view of the foregoing, it may be deduced that the medical evidence 
adduced during the trial falls markedly short of furnishing any 
meaningful corroboration to the ocular testimony.  
10. 
This Court has further observed that after their arrest the 
appellants Muhammad Irshad and Muhammad Shehbaz purportedly 
made separate disclosures on 18.02.2018 before Arif Ali, Inspector 
(CW.8) and in consequence thereof, led to the recovery of a .244 bore 
rifle (P.8) and a Kalashnikov (P.9), which were taken into possession 
through memos Exh.CW.14/A and Exh.CW.16/A, respectively. 

20 
Criminal Appeal No.33345 of 2021 & 
Criminal Revision No.36862 of 2021 
 
 
Similarly, during the spot inspection conducted by Saif Ullah Niazi, 
SI (CW.7) on 23.12.2017, thirty Kalashnikov empties (P.1/1-30), 
eight .244 bore empties (P.2/1-8), and twenty .12-bore gun empties 
(P.3/1-20) were secured vide memo Exh.PE. All recovered weapons 
and crime-scene empties were sent to PFSA for forensic comparison. 
According to the PFSA report (Exh.CW-18/A), although the weapons 
recovered from the appellants were found to be in proper mechanical 
working condition, yet the crime empties could not be matched with 
them due to lack of corresponding individual characteristics. 
Consequently, the PFSA report (Exh.CW-18/A) provides no support 
to the prosecution and is rendered inconsequential.  
11. 
I have also carefully considered the motive alleged in the FIR 
as well as in the private complaint. According to the complainant 
Muhammad Akram (PW.1), at about 10:30 a.m., prior to the murder 
incident, a minor dispute occurred between his brother Muhammad 
Ramzan and Waheed Ahsan (PW.2) on one side, and the accused 
Javed Iqbal on the other, over a public pond because the deceased 
Muhammad Ramzan and Waheed Ahsan (PW.2) had restrained Javed 
Iqbal co-accused (since acquitted) from attempting to take possession 
of the public pond with the help of the police, which allegedly caused 
Javed Iqbal (since acquitted) to harbor a grudge. Although both 
Muhammad Akram (PW.1) and Muhammad Asghar (PW.3) 
mentioned this alleged motive during their examination-in-chief, yet 
they candidly admitted during cross-examination that the said 
altercation had not taken place in their presence. For clarity, a relevant 
portion of the cross-examination of the complainant Muhammad 
Akram (PW-1) is reproduced below:- 
“I was not present when altercation took place between Waheed 
Ahsan, Ramzan and Javed…… Muhammad Ramzan my brother had 
informed me about the altercation taken place regarding motive part.” 
 
Furthermore, the prosecution has alleged that the deceased 
Muhammad Ramzan had prevented the accused Javed Iqbal (since 
acquitted) from obtaining possession of the public pond through the 
police. This assertion naturally suggests that the dispute over the pond 

21 
Criminal Appeal No.33345 of 2021 & 
Criminal Revision No.36862 of 2021 
 
 
must previously have been brought before the police for inquiry or 
some proceedings. However, no such police record has been produced 
either during the investigation or at the trial. In these circumstances, I 
am convinced that the motive advanced by the prosecution is merely 
an overzealous effort to strengthen an otherwise weak case.  
12. 
This Court is mindful that the appellants stand blamed with 
taking the life of a young man and inflicting firearm injuries upon 
another, however even in such heinous offences, the prosecution 
cannot be relieved of its duty to establish the case beyond even a 
scintilla of doubt. A thorough examination of the record reveals 
multiple inconsistencies in the prosecution’s evidence, the benefit of 
which must inevitably go to the appellants, and which can most 
appropriately be granted through an order of acquittal. As the Holy 
Prophet (ﷺ) taught, it is better to err in releasing a guilty person than 
to punish an innocent one. Same principle was also followed by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case reported as Ayub Masih v. The 
State (PLD 2002 SC 1048), wherein, it was observed as follows:- 
“…. It will not be out of place to mention here that this rule 
occupies a pivotal place in the Islamic Law and is enforced 
rigorously in view of the saying of the Holy Prophet (p.b.u.h) that 
the “mistake of Qazi (Judge) in releasing a criminal is better than 
his mistake in punishing an innocent.”  
 
In supra mentioned case of Ayub Masih, the Supreme Court was also 
pleased to observe as under:- 
“…The rule of benefit of doubt, which is described as the golden 
rule, is essentially a rule of prudence which cannot be ignored 
while dispensing justice in accordance with law. It is based on the 
maxim, “it is better that ten guilty persons be acquitted rather than 
one innocent person be convicted.” 
 
13. 
For the reasons stated above, Criminal Appeal No.33345 of 
2021 is allowed. The conviction and sentence awarded by the learned 
trial Court to appellants Muhammad Shehbaz and Muhammad Irshad 
alias Babboo are hereby set aside, and they are acquitted of the 
charge. Appellant Muhammad Shehbaz, who is currently in custody, 
shall be released forthwith if he is not required in any other case. As 
appellant Muhammad Irshad alias Babboo is already on bail, his 
sureties are accordingly discharged from their bail bonds.  As a result, 

22 
Criminal Appeal No.33345 of 2021 & 
Criminal Revision No.36862 of 2021 
 
 
Criminal Revision No.36862 of 2021 which seeks enhancement of 
the sentence of Muhammad Shehbaz & Muhammad Irshad alias 
Babboo (respondents No.2 & 3), being devoid of merit, is accordingly 
dismissed.
