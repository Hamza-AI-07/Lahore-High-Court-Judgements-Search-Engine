Advocate

the 
petitioners. 
 
 
Through this civil revision, the petitioners have 
challenged the vires of judgment & decree dated 
11.09.2024 passed by the learned Addl. District Judge, 
Zafarwal who accepted the appeal of the respondents, 
set aside the judgment & decree dated 09.02.2022 
passed by the learned Civil Judge, Zafarwal and 
decreed the suit for declaration filed by the 
respondents as prayed for.  
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that respondents No.1 
to 31/ plaintiffs filed a suit for declaration against the 
petitioners and proforma respondents No.32 to 
37/defendants contending therein that Bashir Ahmad, 
Muhammad Sharif and Munshi, predecessor-in-
interest of the respondents/plaintiffs were local 
residents, they were owners in possession of Khasra 
Nos.853/1 and 853/2. That Ghulam Muhammad and 
Nazir 
Ahmad 
(predecessor-in-interest 
of 
the 

Civil Revision No.59188 of 2024 
2 
 
 
defendants) were migrated from Jammu & Kashmir in 
the 
year 
1947. 
Predecessor-in-interest 
of 
the 
respondents/plaintiffs 
were 
cultivating 
the 
suit 
property. That in consolidation (Bandobast) of land, 
Khasra Nos.853/1 and 853/2 were changed into Khasra 
Nos.1041 and 1042. The petitioners/defendants with 
connivance of the revenue official got incorporated 
their names in column of cultivation as Dakheelkar in 
the record of rights for the years 1976-77, without any 
justification and they were not entitled to get 
incorporate said entry as their names were not 
recorded before 21st day of October 1868. In the year 
1980 and 1984 consolidation proceedings were carried 
out whereby Khasra Nos.1041 & 1042 were again 
changed into Khasra Nos.1774 & 1775. The 
petitioners/defendants were also got entered as 
Dakheelkar in the column of cultivation in the record 
of rights for the years 1981 & 1982. On the basis of 
those unwarranted entries, an order was passed by the 
Assistant Commissioner, Narowal on 26.05.1996 and 
on the basis of said order petitioners got attested 
mutation No.2537 dated 26.09.1996 for conferment of 
proprietary rights whereas the entire proceedings are 
void, illegal and based on fraud.  
Petitioners/defendants No.1,2,5 to 17 filed 
contesting written statement. Out of divergent 

Civil Revision No.59188 of 2024 
3 
 
 
pleadings of the parties, issues were framed and 
evidence was recorded. The trial court vide judgment 
& decree dated 09.02.2022 dismissed the suit of the 
respondents. Respondents, feeling aggrieved with the 
aforementioned judgment & decree, preferred an 
appeal which was accepted by the appellate court vide 
judgment & decree dated 11.09.2024 who after setting 
aside the judgment & decree dated 09.02.2022 decreed 
the suit for declaration filed by the respondents as 
prayed for. Hence, this civil revision.  
3. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
4. 
Under Section 6 of the Punjab Tenancy Act, 
1887, a person should hold tenancy before 21st day of 
October, 1868. For ready reference, Section 6 of the 
Act ibid is reproduced as under: 
 “6. Right of occupancy of other tenants recorded 
as having the right before passing of Punjab 
Tenancy Act, 1868.– A tenant recorded in a record-
of-rights sanctioned by the Provincial Government, 
before the twenty-first day of October, 1868, as a 
tenant having a right of occupancy in land which he 
has continuously occupied from the time of the 
preparation of that record, shall be deemed to have a 
right of occupancy in that land unless the contrary 
has been established by a decree of a competent 
Court in a suit instituted before the passing of this 
Act.” 
Section 5 of the Punjab Tenancy Act, 1887 requires 
that a tenant should have been in possession over the 
land at the time of commencement of said Act ibid or 
since more than two generations in the male line 
descendants for a period not less than 20 years without 

Civil Revision No.59188 of 2024 
4 
 
 
paying rent. For ready reference, Section 5 of the Act 
ibid is reproduced as under: 
 “5. Tenants having right of occupancy.– (1) A 
tenant– 
(a) who at the commencement of this Act 
has, for more than two generations in the 
male line of descent through a grandfather or 
grand uncle and for a period of not less than 
twenty years, been occupying land paying no 
rent therefor beyond the amount of the land-
revenue thereof and the rates and cesses for 
the time being chargeable thereon, or 
(b) who having owned land, and having 
ceased to be land-owner thereof otherwise 
than by forfeiture to the Government or than 
by any voluntary act, has, since he ceased to 
be land-owner, continuously occupied the 
land, or 
(c) who, in a village or estate in which he 
settled alongwith, or was settled by, the 
founder thereof as a cultivator therein, 
occupied land on the twenty first day of 
October, 
1868, 
and 
has 
continuously 
occupied the land since that date, or 
(d) who, being jagirdar of the estate or any 
part of the estate in which the land occupied 
by him is situate, has continuously occupied 
the land for not less than twenty years, or 
having been such jagirdar, occupied the land 
while he was jagirdar and has continuously 
occupied it for not less than twenty years, 
has a right of occupancy in the land so occupied, 
unless, in the case of a tenant belonging to the class 
specified in clause (c), the landlord proves that the 
tenant was settled on land previously cleared and 
brought under cultivation by, or at the expense of, 
the founder. 
(2) If a tenant proves that he has continuously 
occupied land for thirty years and paid no rent 
therefor beyond the amount of the land-revenue 
thereof and the rates and cesses for the time being 
chargeable thereon, it may be presumed that he has 
fulfilled the conditions of clause (a) of sub-    
section (1). 
(3) The words in that clause denoting natural 
relationship denote also relationship by adoption, 
including therein the customary appointment of an 
heir and relationship, by the usage of a religious 
community.”

The petitioners failed to produced their pedigree table 
and waja tasmia to establish that they were 
descendants of original tenant and they occupied the 
land for more than two generations without paying any 
rent and their predecessor was settled on or before 
31.10.1868 whereas their status was mentioned in 
revenue record as ‘tenants at will’. Thus, tenancy of 
the petitioners has not been established through any 
documentary evidence. Reliance is placed on a 
judgment titled as Muhammad Shafi and others Vs. 
Custodian of Evacuee Property and others (1985 CLC 
3005) and Amir Hussain Shah and 5 others Vs. Ranjha 
and others (2000 YLR 2188). Under Section 6 the 
Punjab Tenancy Act, 1887, Dakheelkar occupancy 
tenant is the only tenant who has possession upon the 
land about 20 years prior to promulgation of the said 
Act. Moreover, DW1 in his cross examination has 
admitted that they are evacuee from Azad Jammu & 
Kashmir in 1947. DW2 also stated that they migrated 
from Jammu & Kashmir at the time of partition of 
India. Petitioners/defendants in their written statement 
mentioned that their predecessors were in possession 
of suit property for the last 40/41 years which proves 
that defendants were not in possession of the suit 
property since 21st day of October 1868. The record 
also shows that prior to the preparation of record of 

Civil Revision No.59188 of 2024 
6 
 
 
rights 1976-77 the names of predecessors of 
petitioners were not mentioned in the revenue record 
as occupancy tenant rather names of predecessors of 
the respondents/plaintiffs are mentioned in column of 
ownership in the record of rights pertaining to the 
years 1956-57 (Exh.D2), 1964-65 (Exh.D4) & Exh.P1 
respectively. Further, it is worth mentioning here that 
prior to sanctioning of impugned mutation No.2537 
dated 26.09.1996, the particulars of the petitioners did 
not exist in the revenue record as occupancy tenant 
and even no affirmative document is produced by the 
petitioners to show their being occupancy tenants 
under the Tenancy Act 1887, as such any entry made 
by the revenue officer as well as order dated 
26.05.1996 passed by the Assistant Commissioner, 
Narowal are perverse and patently illegal. The trial 
court decided issue No.4 in favour of the respondents 
/plaintiffs but the petitioners neither challenged the 
findings on said issue nor filed any cross objections 
under Order XLI Rule 22 CPC, as such the said issue 
had attained the status of finality against the 
petitioners/defendants and had become past and closed 
transaction. 
Reliance 
is 
placed 
on 
Pakistan 
International Airlines Corporation Vs. Aziz ur Rehman 
Chaudhary and another (2016 SCMR 14).

5. 
As the trial court has failed to appreciate the 
legal and factual aspects of the case and on the basis of 
misreading and non-reading of evidence dismissed the 
suit of respondents/plaintiffs whereas the appellate 
court through a well-reasoned judgment has decreed 
the suit and has committed no illegality. It is well 
settled law that in the event of conflict of judgments, 
findings of appellate Court are to be preferred, unless 
it is proved from the record that such findings are not 
supported by evidence. Reliance is placed on the cases 
titled as Muhammad Hafeez & Another Vs. District 
Judge, Karachi East & Another (2008 SCMR 398) and 
Rao Abdul Rehman (deceased) through legal heirs Vs. 
Muhammad Afzal (deceased) through legal heirs and 
others (2023 SCMR 815).   
6. 
In view of the matter, this civil revision is 
hereby dismissed in limine being devoid of any merits 
with no order as to cost.  
7. 
Before parting with this judgment, it is 
important to note that the revenue hierarchy without 
following the procedure prescribed in Sections 5 & 6 
of the Punjab Tenancy Act, 1887 is granting 
proprietary rights to many persons in the province on 
the basis of The Punjab Conferment of Proprietary 
Rights on Occupancy Tenants and Muqarraridars Act, 

Civil Revision No.59188 of 2024 
8 
 
 
2012 and also ignoring the definition of “occupancy 
tenant” mentioned in Section 2(b) of the Act, 2012 
ibid. The act of the revenue hierarchy is not only 
unwarranted but also illegal and unlawful which is 
required to be addressed. Thus, a copy of this 
judgment be transmitted to the Senior Member, Board 
of Revenue, Punjab who shall issue clear directions to 
all the concerned quarters to consider the criteria 
prescribed in Sections 5 & 6 of the Punjab Tenancy 
Act, 1887 before granting proprietary rights under 
Section 2(b) of The Punjab Conferment of Proprietary 
Rights on Occupancy Tenants and Muqarraridars Act, 
2012.
