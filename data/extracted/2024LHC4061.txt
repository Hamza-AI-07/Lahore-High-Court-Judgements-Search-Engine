This constitutional petition 
challenges different show cause notices which are 
attached as Annexures “T”, “T/1” to “T/5” (“Impugned 
Notices”). These show cause notices have been issued 
under section 10(3) and 11(2) of the Sales Tax Act, 
1990 (“Act, 1990”) read with rule 37 of the Sales Tax 
Rules, 2006 notified by SRO 555(1)/2006. 
2. 
 
The historical background has been stated in 
the petition which refers to certain orders passed by the 
Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (“ATIR”) in Sales 
Tax Reference Nos.23 of 2010, 30 of 2011 and 06 of 
2017 which were filed before this Court and which 
were decided with the observation that no questions of 
law arise for determination by this Court and the 

 
W.P. No.15793 of 2022. 
 
 
 
 
     -2- 
 
 
 
 
reference applications against orders of ATIR have 
been dismissed. An appeal was filed to the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan and through an order dated 
27.12.2017, the Civil Petition No.3-L of 2014 was 
dismissed. Similarly, in C.P. Nos.2-L and 41-L of 2014, 
similar observations were made by the Supreme Court 
of Pakistan and as a result, orders of this Court were 
held to be in consonance with law. It is case of the 
petitioner that despite orders by the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan on 27.12.2017, the department neither paid the 
approved claims nor processed the refunds of claim 
which constrained the company to file a complaint 
before Federal Tax Ombudsman. On 07.02.2022, 
petitioner-company addressed a letter to the Deputy 
Commissioner (Refund) bringing to his notice the fact 
that the matter had already been settled finally by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan. Subsequently, another 
complaint was filed with the Federal Tax Ombudsman 
where the department took a new plea to the fact that 
the suppliers were suspended and blacklisted and so the 
amount of refund of Rs.78.828 million could not be 
sanctioned. Obviously, this is contrary to what was 
decided by the courts as stated above. According to the 
learned counsel for the petitioner as a counterblast, 
petitioner-company has now been served with a show 

 
W.P. No.15793 of 2022. 
 
 
 
 
     -3- 
 
 
 
 
cause notice impugned herein after 15 years and 08 
months. This has been done pursuant to a permission 
granted by the Federal Board of Revenue under section 
74 of the Act, 1990. The Federal Board of Revenue 
condoned the time limit up to 29.08.2022 for 
finalization of assessment proceedings but the show 
cause notices were issued on 22.08.2022. It is case of 
the petitioner-company that the show cause notice 
envisaged the same dispute which has already been 
decided by the courts up to the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan. 
3. 
 
Learned 
counsel 
for 
the 
respondent-
department has placed on record the documents relating 
to condonation of time limit under section 74 of the 
Act. On 26.04.2022, a letter was addressed by the 
Assistant Commissioner Inland Revenue to the 
Commissioner Inland Revenue seeking the grant of 
condonation of time limit for issuance of show cause 
notice. It is pertinent to mention that the tax period 
mentioned in the letter is October 2005, February 2006, 
December 2006, July 2007, January 2007, June 2007, 
November 2005, December 2005 and February 2007. 
This letter was forwarded to FBR on 08.06.2022. By an 
approval dated 01.07.2022, FBR condoned the time 
limit under section 74 of the Act for assessment 

 
W.P. No.15793 of 2022. 
 
 
 
 
     -4- 
 
 
 
 
proceedings under section 11 for these periods in the  
 
following terms: 
     “I am directed to refer to your letter 
No.CCIR/SO-ST/F-53/2020-21/16194 dated 
08-06-2022 on the subject cited above and 
to state that in exercise of powers conferred 
under section 74 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990, 
FBR is pleased to condone the time limit 
upto 
29-08-2022 
for 
finalisation 
of 
assessment proceedings initiated against 
M/s. Mehr Dastgir Leather & Footwear 
Industries 
(Pvt) 
Ltd, 
Multan 
STRN: 
0407640500646 for the tax period Oct-2005, 
Feb-2006, Dec-2006, July-2007, Jan-2007, 
June-2007 in terms of section 11 of the Sales 
Tax Act, 1990. 
2. 
  Final report may be communicated 
to the Board once the proceedings are 
finalized.” 
 
4. 
 
Firstly, the time limit was condoned up to 
29.08.2022 and obviously the proceedings in the show 
cause notice which was issued on 22.08.2022 were not 
finalized by that date. Hence, proceedings beyond the 
condonation of time limit up to 29.08.2022 are ultra 
vires and beyond the jurisdiction of the officer issuing 
the show cause notice.  
5. 
 
Secondly, the very basis on which show 
cause notices have been triggered is the exercise of 
power conferred under section 74 of the Act by FBR 
whereby time limit was condoned up to 29.08.2022 for 

 
W.P. No.15793 of 2022. 
 
 
 
 
     -5- 
 
 
 
 
finalization of assessment proceedings. Section 74 
provides that: 
“74. Condonation of time-limit.– Where 
any time or period has been specified under 
any of the provisions of the Act or rules 
made there under within which any 
application is to be made or any act or thing 
is to be done, the Board may, at any time 
before or after the expiry of such time or 
period, in any case or class of cases, permit 
such application to be made or such act or 
thing to be done within such time or period 
as it may consider appropriate. 
Provided that the Board may, by notification 
in the official Gazette, and subject to such 
limitations or conditions as may be specified 
therein, empower any Commissioner to 
exercise the powers under this section in any 
case or class of cases.” 
 
6. 
 
The above provision grants power to the 
Board to permit an act or thing to be done within such 
period or time as it may be considered appropriate. This 
condonation applies where any time or period has been 
specified under any provision of the Act or rules within 
which any application is to be made or any of the act or 
thing is to be done. The condonation may under 
peculiar circumstances permit such act or thing to be 
done within an extended period of time. Quite clearly, 
this provision does not apply to an action being taken 
under section 11 (now repealed) which relates to 
assessment of tax and recovery of tax not levied or 
short levied or erroneously refunded. The action against 
the petitioner-company is being taken under section 

 
W.P. No.15793 of 2022. 
 
 
 
 
     -6- 
 
 
 
 
11(2) and alleges that the petitioner-company has 
claimed a refund which is not admissible under the Act. 
From a reading of section 74 of the Act, it can be 
discerned that there have to be reasonable and rational 
grounds which should compel the Board to make an 
order in the nature of the one envisaged by section 74. 
It is not an automatic exercise of power or a request 
made by an officer of Inland Revenue. Reasonable 
cause has to be spelt out both in the application as well 
as in the permission granted on that application which 
is conspicuously missing in the order which has been 
reproduced above. It is not enough for FBR to simply 
condone the time limit and this must be supported by 
reasons and on the basis of documents which would 
show that there were circumstances beyond the control 
of officers of Inland Revenue at the relevant time which 
constrained them from taking action under the normal 
time limit. 
7. 
 
Learned counsel for the petitioner has relied 
upon a judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
reported as Federal Board of Revenue through 
Chairman, Islamabad and others v. Abdul Ghani and 
another (2021 SCMR 1154) and the following 
observations were made therein:- 
“3. 
 More importantly, the order passed 
under section 74 of the Act by the FBR fails 

 
W.P. No.15793 of 2022. 
 
 
 
 
     -7- 
 
 
 
 
to state any reason for extending the 
limitation period for issuance of a show 
cause notice against the Respondent. The 
said requirement is meant to ensure fairness 
and transparency in the exercise of statutory 
discretion by the FBR which suffers from 
opacity and therefore unreasonableness. It 
is also noted that section 74 of the Act 
neither specifically envisages nor provides 
guidance, 
criteria 
or 
parameters 
for 
overriding any limitation period prescribed 
by the Act for initiating action against a 
taxpayer. Consequently, on the facts of the 
present case we are not inclined to interpret 
the said provision as authorizing the 
unchecked reversal of a statutory limitation 
period and consequential legal rights 
created by it. In the circumstances, the show 
cause notice issued by the petitioner 
department suffers from fatal defects that 
float on the face of the record. Accordingly 
we are not inclined to interfere with the 
impugned judgment.” 
 
8. 
 
The holding of the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan is clear and unequivocal and it has been held 
that no guidelines or parameters have been mentioned 
in section 74 of the Act and the least that FBR should 
do is to provide reasons for extending the limitation 
period. There cannot be unbridled reversal of statutory 
period of limitation as legal rights have come to accrue 
in the registered person. On these grounds, show cause 
notices were held to be ultra vires and were set aside. 
The facts of the present case are on all fours with the 
cited judgment and there are no reasonable grounds 
mentioned in the letter of condonation by FBR which 
would give power to the officer to issue a show cause 

 
W.P. No.15793 of 2022. 
 
 
 
 
     -8- 
 
 
 
 
notice after almost 15 years. In the meantime, rights 
have come to vest in the petitioner-company which 
cannot be upset by issuance of show cause notice. 
Further, the issuance of show cause notice clearly 
smacks of mala fide as refund claim of the petitioner-
company have been delayed and instead of doing so, 
petitioner-company has been served with a frivolous 
and vicious show cause notice. 
9. 
 
In view of the above, this petition is allowed 
and the Impugned Notices are struck down and 
quashed. The respondent-department is directed to 
process the refund claims of the petitioner-company 
within the next three months.
