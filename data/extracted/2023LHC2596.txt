JUDGMENT 
Date of Hearing

Petitioner(s)  by: 
Mr. Asad Abbas Dhother, Assistant Advocate 
General  
Respondent(s) by: 
Malik Amir Mukhtar, Advocate   
 
 
ABID HUSSAIN CHATTHA, J. This Judgment shall decide the titled Writ 
Petitions since identical questions of law and fact are involved in both the 
Petitions. Jaffar Ahmad, Respondent No. 1 in Writ Petition No. 15270 / 2023 
and Mubashar Ali Shahzad, Respondent No. 1 in Writ Petition No. 15295 / 
2023 shall be collectively referred to as (the “Respondents”). 
2. 
The titled constitutional Petitions are directed against the impugned 
Judgments dated 02.08.2022 and 17.11.2022 passed by Labour Court No. 5, 
Sargodha (the “Labour Court”) and the Punjab Labour Appellate Tribunal, 
Lahore (the “Appellate Tribunal”), respectively, whereby, the grievance 
Petitions filed by the Respondents under Section 33 of the Punjab Industrial 
Relations Act, 2010 (the “PIRA Act”) were accepted and the Respondents 
were regularized in the service as “permanent employees” against the posts 
for which they were already serving on work charge basis under the 
Petitioner Department from the date of appointment. It was also held that the 
Respondents shall enjoy all the benefits of a regular and permanent employee 
of the Petitioner Department as admissible under the relevant rules and laws. 
3. 
In Writ Petition No. 15270 / 2023, Respondent No. 1 instituted a 
grievance Petition alleging therein that he was appointed as Baildar on 
16.07.2016 by the Irrigation Department, Government of the Punjab on work 

2 
W. P. No. 15270 of 2023 
W. P. No. 15295 of 2023 
charge basis against the regular post. He possessed unblemished record and 
has been performing his duties to the entire satisfaction of his superiors. He 
was accordingly, entitled for regularization in the service since he falls within 
the definition of workman as defined under the PIRA Act and the Industrial 
& Commercial Employment (Standing Orders) Ordinance, 1968 (the 
“Standing Order”). It was further asserted that the Respondent had 
completed his probationary period and had attained the status of permanent 
workman and also served grievance notice before filing of the grievance 
Petition.  
4. 
In connected Writ Petition No. 15295 / 2023, Respondent No. 1 filed 
his grievance Petition alleging therein that he was appointed as Driver on 
work charge basis against the permanent post on 18.11.2018 by the Irrigation 
Department, Government of the Punjab. He had completed his probationary 
period and having satisfactory service to his credit was entitled to be 
regularized in service.  
5. 
The Petitioners in their written reply resisted the grievance Petitions 
both on legal and factual plane. It was submitted that appointment of the 
Respondents was primarily on work charge basis and there was a separate 
procedure for regular appointment through advertisement and due process of 
law. The Respondents do not fulfill the criteria of workmen and as such, 
cannot be regularized. It was emphasized that the PIRA Act and the Standing 
Order were not applicable to the cases of the Respondents. 
6. 
The Labour Court found that the Respondents were appointed as 
Baildar and Driver in the Irrigation Department on 16.07.2016 and 
18.11.2018 on work charge basis for a limited period but that period was 
extended from time to time with short intervals. Such artificial breaks in 
continuation of service through deliberate short intervals have been 
deprecated by the Apex Court in its various pronouncements. The 
Respondents have remained employees for a number of years in service. 
Therefore, by relying upon cases titled, “Punjab Seed Corporation through 
Managing Director and another v. Labour Court No. 9, Multan through 
Presiding Officer and 2 others” (2015 PLC 232); and “Managing Director, 
Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd., Karachi v. Ghulam Abbas and others” 

3 
W. P. No. 15270 of 2023 
W. P. No. 15295 of 2023 
(PLD 2003 Supreme Court 724), the Labour Court held that the 
Respondents fell within the definition of “workmen” as envisaged under 
Section 2(i) of the Standing Order and were competent to institute the 
grievance Petitions before the Labour Court. Hence, the Petitions were 
allowed primarily based upon the length of service of the Respondents for 
having rendered services for more than 03 years against the temporary post 
and in this context, it was held that the Respondents had been recruited 
against permanent posts. 
7. 
In Appeals, the Appellate Tribunal, while relying upon case titled, 
“Secretary, Irrigation and Power Department Government of Punjab, Lahore 
and others v. Muhammad Akhtar and others” (2009 SCMR 320)  held that 
Irrigation Department was an establishment under Section 2(ix) of the PIRA 
Act. It further opined that Section 2(c) of the Punjab Regularization of 
Services Act, 2018 (the “Regularization Act”) specifically provides that the 
Regularization Act does not apply to work charged and daily wages 
employees of the Government Departments which means that prevalent 
labour laws shall apply to all workmen employed  in all Government 
Departments. The cases titled, “Board of Intermediate and Secondary 
Education, DG Khan and another v. Muhammad Altaf and others” (2018 
SCMR 325); and “Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, 
Faisalabad through Chairman and others v. Tanveer Sajid and others” (2018 
SCMR 1405) were also relied upon to hold that artificial break of a few days 
while issuing appointment letter for 89 days of service would be considered a 
malafide on the part of the Department and would be construed as continuous 
service. The Appellate Tribunal further noted that Article 1(b) to the 
Schedule of the Standing Order stipulates that a permanent workman is a 
workman engaged in a work of permanent nature and as such, it was not 
necessary that he was employed against the permanent post and a workman 
attains the status of a permanent workman if he has continuously worked for 
longer than 09 months in a job of permanent nature. Accordingly, it was 
declared that the PIRA Act and the Standing Order are fully applicable to the 
case of the Respondents and in consequence thereof, the Appeals filed by the 
Petitioners were dismissed.

8. 
Learned Law Officer submitted that the Respondents temporarily 
employed on work charge basis were not entitled to be regularized as the 
PIRA Act and the Standing Order were not applicable to the case of the 
Respondents since the Irrigation Department, Government of the Punjab was 
not an Industrial & Commercial establishment and was excluded from their 
purview having statutory rules of service governing the workmen employed 
by the Department. He relied upon cases titled “Province of Punjab and 3 
others v. Gul Hassan and 33 others” (1992 PLC 924); “Quetta Municipal 
Corporation through Administrator and another v. Registrar, Trade Unions, 
Balochistan, Directorate of Labour and Manpower, Quetta and 3 others” 
(1995 PLC 151); “Sh. Ahmad Sadiq v. Chief Settlement Commissioner and 
others” (PLD 1974 Supreme Court 368); “The Management of Municipal 
Committee, Mianwali v. (1) The General Secretary, Municipal Muharrirs 
Union and (2) The 1st Industrial Court” (PLD 1968 Lahore 395); “Technical 
Education and Vocational Training Authority through Chief Operating 
Officer and another v. Hafiz Naseer and 2 others” (2016 PLC 360); “Lahore 
Development Authority and others v. Hafiz Abdul Khaliq and others” (2019 
PLC 175); and “Province of Punjab through Secretary, Irrigation 
Department, Jhang v. Sajjad Naseem and 3 others” (2022 PLC 44) to 
substantiate his claim. 
9. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the Respondents submitted that the 
PIRA Act and the Standing Order were fully applicable to the case of the 
Respondents. Reliance was placed on cases titled, “Khalid Mehmood v. State 
Life Insurance Corporation of Pakistan and others” (2018 SCMR 376); 
“Fauji Sugar Mills through General Manager v. Mehmood Ahmed” (2006 
PLC 630); “Abdul Ghafoor and others v. The President National Bank of 
Pakistan and  others” (2018 SCMR 157); and Muhammad Altaf  case 
(supra).  
10. 
The point for determination before this Court is as to whether the PIRA 
Act and the Standing Order were applicable to the case of the Respondents 
and the impugned Judgments had been passed in consonance with law. The 
first proviso of Section 1(4)(c) of the Standing Order provides that it shall not 

5 
W. P. No. 15270 of 2023 
W. P. No. 15295 of 2023 
 apply to industrial and commercial establishments carried on by or under the 
Federal or any Provincial Government, where statutory rules of service, 
conduct or discipline are applicable to the workmen employed therein. There 
is no denial on the part of the Respondents that the temporary employment 
was governed by statutory rules. Similarly, Section 1(3)(b) of the PIRA Act 
specifically provides that it shall not apply to any person employed in the 
administration of the state other than those employed as workmen by the 
Railway and Pakistan Post. The Departments of the Government of the 
Punjab do not figure in the definition of “establishment” as defined in Section 
2(ix) of the PIRA Act. The definition of “workman” as stipulated in Section 
2(xxxi) of the PIRA Act only extends to a person not falling within the 
definition of employer who is employed in an establishment or industry. As 
such, it is conspicuously clear that a daily wager employed in Government 
Department is excluded from the application of the PIRA Act. The question 
of jurisdiction of the Labour Court and the Appellate Tribunal with respect to 
an employee working for a Government Department was directly considered 
in case titled, “Province of Punjab through Secretary Population Welfare 
Department and 2 others v. Farzana Basharat and 2 others” (2020 PLC 260), 
wherein, it was held in paragraph No. 6 as under:- 
“The term 'commercial establishment' is defined in Section 2(b) of the 
Standing Orders to mean an establishment in which business of 
advertising, commission or forwarding is conducted and includes a 
clerical department of a factory or of any industrial or commercial 
undertaking, the office establishment of a person who for the purpose 
of fulfilling a contract with the owner of any commercial establishment 
or industrial establishment, employs workmen, a unit of a joint stock 
company, an insurance company, a banking company or a bank, a 
broker's office or stock-exchange, a club, a hotel, a restaurant or any 
eating house, a cinema or theatre, and such other establishment or 
class thereof, as Government may, by notification in the official 
Gazette, declare to be a commercial establishment. Section 1 of the 
Standing Orders clearly provides in its proviso that nothing in this 
Ordinance shall apply to industrial and commercial establishments 
carried out by or under the authority of the [Federal] or any 
Provincial Government, where statutory rules of service, conduct or 
discipline are applicable to the workmen employed therein. Admittedly, 
Respondent No. 1 worked for a government department, which is not a 
commercial establishment under the Standing Orders, as it does not 
fall under the definition of commercial establishment nor has it been 
notified as a commercial establishment which is a fundamental 

6 
W. P. No. 15270 of 2023 
W. P. No. 15295 of 2023 
requirement under the Standing Orders. Furthermore, as per the 
proviso to Section 1, the Standing Orders will not apply to Federal or 
Provincial government department, where statutory rules of service, 
conduct or discipline are applicable to the workmen employed. In this 
case, this fact was totally overlooked as Respondent No. 1 sought 
regularization as a post of a government department. In the same way, 
PIRA defines establishment as any office, firm, factory, society, 
undertaking, company, shop, premises or enterprise in the Punjab, 
which employs workmen directly or through a contractor for the 
purpose of carrying on any business or industry and includes all its 
departments and branches, whether situated in the same place or in 
different places having a common balance sheet and except in section 
25 includes a collective bargaining unit, if any, constituted in any 
establishment or group of establishments. Section 1(3)(b) of PIRA 
provides that this Act will not apply to a person employed in the 
administration of the State. Consequently, a government department 
does not fall under the Standing Orders or PIRA. This was totally 
overlooked by both the Labour Courts and the Labour Appellate 
Tribunal which failed to consider the fact that Respondent No.1 
worked for a government department and did not fall under the 
Standing Orders or PIRA." 
In the aforesaid Judgment, it was also held that regularization of an employee 
is governed under the Regularization Act which importantly excludes persons 
employed on work charge basis. A government employee must advance his 
claim of regularization under the Regularization Act and if the claim of the 
employee was prior to its enforcement, then on the strength of the policy and 
the notification that addresses the issue of regularization in contrast to merely 
seeking regularization based on the length of service under the PIRA Act or 
the Standing Order for the reason that regularization prerequisites existence 
of a sanctioned post with budget.  
11. 
Similarly, in case titled, “Parks and Horticulture Authority and others 
v. Ejaz Ahmad Sial” (2020 PLC (C.S.) 214), it was held that there is no 
vested right to be regularized in the service and regularization in the first 
instance is an executive function requiring sanctioned post as it involves 
financial considerations upon Government exchequer. In the instant Petitions, 
it was established from record that the Respondents were not recruited on 
regular basis through advertisement and due process of law but were 
temporarily employed and as such, could not be regularized as there were no 
sanctioned posts against which they could be absorbed. Further, reliance is 
placed on cases titled, “Province of Punjab through Secretary Agriculture 

7 
W. P. No. 15270 of 2023 
W. P. No. 15295 of 2023 
Department, Lahore and others v. Muhammad Arif and others” (2020 SCMR 
507); “Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through Secretary Forest, 
Peshawar and others v. Sher Aman and others” (2022 SCMR 406); and 
“Deputy Director Finance and Administration FATA through Additional 
Chief Secretary FATA, Peshawar and others v. Dr. Lal Marjan and others” 
(2022 SCMR 566).  
12. 
It, therefore, follows that the Courts below fell in error to hold that the 
PIRA Act and the Standing Order were applicable to the case of the 
Respondents. The case law relied by learned counsel for the Respondents is 
distinguishable for the reason that applicability of the PIRA Act and the 
Standing Order upon an employee is required to be determined with respect 
to the status of an employer as an industrial or commercial establishment. It 
is also noted that jurisprudence evolved on the subject holds that 
regularization is not a vested right of any employee but is dependent on a 
right based on law or policy. Moreover, mere length of service is not the sole 
basis to seek regularization.     
13. 
In view of the above, the titled constitutional Petitions are allowed and 
in consequence thereof, the impugned Judgments dated 02.08.2022 and 
17.11.2022 are set aside having been rendered without jurisdiction.
