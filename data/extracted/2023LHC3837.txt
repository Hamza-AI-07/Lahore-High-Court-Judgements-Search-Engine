Petitioners have assailed in these petitions under Article 199 of the 
Constitution 
of 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Pakistan, 
1973 
(the 
“Constitution”) the retrospective application of Section 4C of the 
Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (the “Ordinance”) and the vires of the 
First Proviso to Division IIB of Part I of the First Schedule of the 
“Ordinance”, introduced through the Finance Act, 2022.  
I. 
CONTEXT OF THE CASE  
2. 
Precisely, all the Petitioners are taxpayers and for the purpose 
of regulating their tax affairs, some of the Petitioners operate and opt 
normal tax year commencing from 1st July and ending on 30th June, 
while the other Petitioners operate and opt special year commencing 
1st January and ending on 31st December. Through these petitions, the 
Petitioners, at the one hand, have made challenge to retrospective 
application of Section 4C while on other hand, have called in question 
the vires of Section 4C First Proviso to Division IIB of Part I of the 
First Schedule of the “Ordinance” being discriminatory in terms of 
Article 25 of the “Constitution” and unlawfully vitiating vested rights 
accrued in past and closed transactions. This judgment will interpret

ANTI-ABUSE DOCTRINES WITH TEXTUALISM, BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 101, Number 4 
(September 2021) P 1471)] In this Article the author has written that “to preserve that right, textualists 
maintain that it must be legitimate for taxpayers to rely on the plain meaning of the tax laws when ordering 
their affairs. Textualist jurisprudence becomes controversial, however, when taxpayers, through evidently 
literal compliance with the law, produce results that are unexpected, quite plainly unreasonable, and appear to 
conflict with congressional intent. In such cases, the government’s interest in the equitable administration of 
tax law is pitted against the taxpayer’s right to lawfully minimize his tax liability. The resulting tension plays 
out in opposing theories of statutory interpretation; textualist judges tend to protect the taxpayer’s reliance on 
the tax laws at the expense of their reasonable and equitable administration, while intentionalist judges do just 
the opposite”.

the language of Section 4C of the “Ordinance” with anatomy of its 
Chapters and Parts, more specifically its charging provisions under 
Section 4C, the tax on taxable income under Chapter III read with 
Procedure under Chapter X, Part I & Part IV. The Court, while 
hearing the case, directed the parties to file report and parawise 
comments alongwith supporting documents explaining the basis of 
inclusion of Section 4C of the “Ordinance”. In compliance, the 
Respondent No.2/FBR filed its reply through Mr. Khalid Ishaq, ASC 
on 13.10.2022, while Ms. Asma Hamid, ASC filed report and 
parawise comments on behalf of the Respondent No.3/CIR on 
02.11.2022 alongwith supporting documents. In addition, counsel for 
most of the Petitioners filed written arguments alongwith gist of case 
laws in their support.

PROCEEDINGS 
BEFORE 
THIS 
COURT 
AND 
SUPREME COURT OF PAKISTAN  
 
3. 
During the hearing of the petitions, the judgment of Sindh 
High Court cited in SHELL PAKISTAN LIMITED through Legal 
Counsel and others Versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through 
Secretary Ministry of Finance and others(2023 PTD 607 Sindh) 
regarding Section 4C of the “Ordinance” was challenged before the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan wherein vide order dated 06.02.2023, 
interim relief was granted in the following manner: 
“In view of the above, the respondents have 
consented to deposit under protest with the tax 
authorities 50% of the liability claimed against 
them 
under 
the 
impugned 
provisions 
of 
Ordinance. However, the amount of such deposit 
shall be reduced by the amount of any refund that 
has been determined by the tax authorities in 
favour of the respondents. Needful to be done 
within one week from the date of this order.” 
 
4. 
Pursuant to passing of aforesaid order, an application bearing 
C.M.No.01 of 2023 was filed on behalf of the Respondent No.3/CIR 
for modification of interim order granted on 27.12.2022. The Court on 
16.02.2023 modified aforesaid order by observing that: 

 
Writ Petition No.58683 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   11 
Since the prayer made in this petition is 
supported with the order of Hon’ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan, there is no need to issue 
notice to the Writ Petitioner (in this petition or 
the other connected petitions/C.Ms. fixed for 
today). Keeping in view the afore-quoted 
directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan, the interim order dated 27.12.2022 
issued in the captioned writ petition and the 
interim orders issued by this Court from time to 
time in other connected writ petitions are hereby 
modified in terms that all the Writ Petitions (in 
this petition as well as the connected Writ 
Petitions) will now deposit under protest with the 
tax authorities 50% of the liability claimed 
against them under the Income Tax Ordinance, 
2001, within seven days. However, the amount of 
such deposit shall be reduced by the amount of 
any refund that has been determined by the tax 
authorities in favour of the said Writ Petitioners. 
This order be placed in all the connected files 
and will be read accordingly for all the 
connected petitions”.  
 
5. 
On 16.02.2023, the Supreme Court of Pakistan heard the 
appeals and granted interim relief at one point by observing that 
“according to learned counsel for the petitioner, the accounting year 
of the respondents ends during the course of Tax Year 2022 to which 
the provisions of Section 4C are lawfully applicable”. At second 
point, it was further observed that “the learned counsel for the 
petitioner submits that the said argument cannot form the basis of 
altogether striking down the impugned Super Tax because implicitly 
the respondents’ arguments accepts liability to taxation at the rate of 
4%. However, he is not able to explain to us the justification for 
charging super tax at higher rate for industries specified in the first 
proviso. We grant him time to prepare his case on that point”.  
Finally, the following order was passed.  
 
“Insofar as the interim relief is concerned, the 
respondents which are liable to pay Super Tax at the 
rate of 10% under the proviso shall deposit the same 
within one week at the rate of 4% which is applicable 

 
Writ Petition No.58683 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   12 
to assessee industries earing incoming exceeding 
Rs.300 million as provided in Division II B ibid but 
falling outside the proviso thereto. In the event that the 
respondents have furnished bank guarantees on the 
direction of the High Court then the same shall be en-
cashed by the petitioner to the extent of 4% tax”.  
 
6. 
Thereafter, while arguing the case from 09.03.2023 onward, 
the Court when confronted to learned counsel for the Respondent/CIR 
whether there are any document on the basis of which the judgment 
was passed by the other Courts, Mr. Khalid Ishaq, ASC for the 
Respondent No.2/FBR and Ms. Asma Hamid, ASC for the 
Respondent No.3/CIR stated that no such document was filed before 
other Courts. Consequently, this Court directed the Respondents to 
justify tax imposed through Section 4C of the “Ordinance” by filing 
proper documents. On 09.03.2023, Ms. Asma Hamid, ASC for the 
Respondent No.3/CIR stated that detailed reply has been submitted 
and requested that same may be treated as replies in all connected 
petitions. However, when parties again and again agitated illegalities 
in the documents, Ms. Asma Hamid, ASC sought further time to file 
supplemental reply. It is noted that when initial reply was filed on the 
directions of this Court, no proper document was annexed. On 
22.03.2023, Ms. Asma Hamid, ASC filed C.M.No.01 of 2023 for 
placing on record some documents which includes Pakistan Economic 
Survey in 2021-2022, brief on Budget Making Process, Budget 
Speech, 2022-2023, policy statement and other documents by giving 
reasons for imposition of super tax through support of constitutional 
provisions.  
III. 
PETITIONERS ARGUMENTS 
7. 
Mr. Salman Akram Raja, ASC has mainly argued that the 
Petitioners’ company is a limited company with listed stock exchange 
and special year has already ended in December, 2021, its AGM was 
held in April, 2022 and profit was distributed to all the shareholders in 
May, 2022, therefore, super tax imposed through Section 4C of the 
“Ordinance” is not applicable being past and closed transaction. He 

 
Writ Petition No.58683 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   13 
further argued that definition of “income” in Section 4C(2) of the 
“Ordinance” excludes adjustments from current year revenue on 
account of brought forward depreciation, brought forward business 
losses and brought forward amortization and for determination of the 
same, the Petitioners have already acted upon it at the close of tax 
year 2022. He has relied on “MOLASSES TRADING & EXPORT 
(PVT.) LTD. Versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN etc” (1993 
SCMR 1905). 
8. 
Mr. Mansoor Usman Awan, ASC argued that the Petitioners 
are seeking declaration regarding exemption of super tax on the 
ground that Section 4C is ultra vires to the “Ordinance”. He added 
that imposition of super tax hit by principle of past and closed 
transaction because in some companies, special year completed from 
1st January to 31st December (the “Special Year”) with cutoff date and 
in other set of cases the Financial year, which is a normal year starts 
from 1st July to 30th June (the “Normal Year”). Hence, no tax can be 
agitated as the Special Year as well as the Normal Years has already 
been ended. He further argued that imposition of supertax is based on 
discrimination and thus is not applicable to the case of the Petitioners. 
9. 
Mr. Shazib Masud, ASC and Barrister Waqas Mir, ASC 
argued that general rates of super tax for all sectors except mentioned 
in first proviso to Division IIB to Part I of First Schedule to the 
“Ordinance” declaring income over 300 million is 4% whereas 
proviso to Division IIB states for year 2022, the persons engaged, 
whether partly or wholly, in the business of airlines, automobiles, 
beverages, cement, chemicals, cigarette and tobacco, fertilizer, iron 
and steel, LNG terminal, oil marketing, oil refining, petroleum and 
gas exploration and production, pharmaceuticals, sugar and textiles 
the rate of tax shall be 10% where the income exceeds Rs.300 million 
therefore, applicability of different rates of taxes on different sectors 
is discriminatory and violative to Article 25 of the “Constitution”. 
10. 
Barrister Haroon Dugal, ASC argued that super tax under 
Section 4C of the “Ordinance” is a tax and Section 4B of the 

 
Writ Petition No.58683 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   14 
“Ordinance” till date has occupied the same field and incidences of 
both the taxes under above said sections are same therefore, two 
charging sections for the same tax are neither permissible under the 
law nor the same can be imposed through two charging sections. He 
further argued that there is no machinery provision for the collection 
of super tax as no rules in terms of Section 4C(6) of the “Ordinance” 
have been framed.  
11. 
Mr. Hassan Kamran Bashir, Advocate argued that Section 4C 
of the “Ordinance” was added through the Finance Act, 2022 with 
effect from 01.07.2022 after the close of Petitioners’ tax year 2022 on 
31.12.2021 and 30.06.2022 hence, for the purpose of tax affairs, it 
becomes a past and closed transaction before the Finance Act, 2022 
became effective. He added that Section 4C of the “Ordinance” is a 
charging section, hence cannot be applied retrospectively to 
transactions that have become past and closed. He next argued that 
retrospective application of the section ibid would create a new tax 
obligation for a tax year that has already been closed as the liability of 
the Petitioners had attained finality on the last date of tax year.  
12. 
Mr. 
Muhammad 
Mansha 
Sukhera, 
Jahangir 
Ahmad, 
Muhammad Zulqarnain, Hassan Kamran Sheikh, Asfandyar Khan 
Tareen and Zoe K. Khan, Advocates adopted the arguments advanced 
by above mentioned learned counsels and also filed their written 
arguments alleging discrimination. Learned counsels in other 
connected petitions also adopted the same arguments. 
IV. 
RESPONDENTS ARGUMENTS 
i. 
Arguments of Respondent No.2-FBR 
13. 
Mr. Khalid Ishaq, ASC for the Respondent No.2/FBR filed 
report and parawise comments and objected qua maintainability of the 
petitions. He argued that the Petitioners are liable to pay tax under 
Section 4C of the “Ordinance” and cannot take advantage of the 
benefit granted to them under Section 74 of the “Ordinance”. He 
further argued that Section 2(68) of the “Ordinance” defines "tax 
year" as tax year defined in sub-section (1) of Section 74 and in 

 
Writ Petition No.58683 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   15 
relation to a person, includes a special tax year or a transitional tax 
year that the person is permitted to use under Section 74 of the 
“Ordinance”. He pointed out that many a Petitioners adopted a 
special tax year in terms of Section 74(3) of the “Ordinance” which 
extends from 1st January to 31st December and mere objecting to 
applicability of Section 4C of the “Ordinance” based on doctrine of 
past and closed transactions is of no avail as payments of dividends 
and purported investments, do not constitutes as events that render the 
finalization of accounts therefore, the reliance on the entire doctrine of 
past and closed transaction is misplaced and has wrongly been 
stretched by many a Petitioners just to obtain exemption from their tax 
obligations.  
ii. Arguments of Respondent No.3-CIR 
14. 
Ms. Asma Hamid, ASC for the Respondent No.3/CIR filed 
report and parawise comments and objected qua maintainability of the 
petitions. She argued that most of the Petitioners were permitted to 
pay their tax liability by using a special year in terms of Section 74 of 
the “Ordinance” which is only a concession and distinct from normal 
tax year i.e. from 1st July of any given year to 30 June of the next year 
hence does not alter the liability to be taxed at the rate of tax to be 
announced through Finance Act, 2022 on 30.06.2022 and its liability 
to pay tax through filing returns by or on 30.09.2022. She added that 
audited accounts and paid dividends relate to internal accounting 
principles and thus have no nexus with liability to pay income tax on 
its computed taxable income at the rate enacted by the legislature. She 
argued that previously the Petitioners have been used to pay super tax 
in terms of Section 4B of the “Ordinance” which is identical in 
language and retrospective in operation and effect than that of Section 
4C of the “Ordinance” thus the Petitioners are estopped by conduct to 
challenge it on the ground of retrospectivity when Section 4B of the 
“Ordinance” levies super tax with retrospective effect. She, by 
relying on a chain of judgments, argued that past and closed 
transactions can be disturbed through legislation where retrospective 

 
Writ Petition No.58683 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   16 
application is expressed through unambiguous, clear language. 
Moreover, she has also placed on record policy considerations for 
enactment of Section 4C of the “Ordinance”, the competency of the 
legislature to impose super tax with retroactive and retrospective 
effect alongwith policy statement of Member (FBR), policy guidelines 
of Annual Budget Statement 2022.  
V. 
DETERMINATION BY THE COURT 
  
i. 
History and legal anthropology of Super Tax 
15. 
From the arguments advanced by learned counsel for the 
parties alongwith documents and case law, grounds viz.a.viz 
retrospective application of Section 4C of the “Ordinance” based on 
the past and closed transaction, discrimination with respect to 
imposing super tax on a particular class of persons and its vires, have 
been agitated. Before proceeding further, it would be advantageous to 
highlight brief history and legal anthropology of the super tax. It is an 
additional tax which is typically levied on high-income individuals or 
corporations as a means to generate additional revenue and promote 
income redistribution. The history of super tax can be traced back to 
various countries and different time periods. During World War-I 
(1914-1918), several countries including United Kingdom, Australia 
and Canada introduced super taxes on wealthy individuals and 
corporations, imposing higher tax rates on their income and profit, 
with the sole purpose to finance the war efforts and cover the 
increased government spending. Super taxes were also implemented, 
during the great depression of 1930s, when many countries faced 
economic crises and sought ways to address income inequality and 
fund social welfare program, as a measure to redistribute wealth and 
support government initiative. For example, the United States 
introduced the Wealth Tax Act of 1935, imposing a surtax on high-
income individuals. After World War II, super taxes continued to be 
utilized in various forms. In the United Kingdom, a supertax was 
introduced in 1949 to address post-war economic challenges. The tax 
primarily targeted high-income individuals and aimed to fund 

 
Writ Petition No.58683 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   17 
reconstruction efforts and social welfare programs. In Indian  
sub-continent, levy of super tax was introduced through Super Tax 
Act of 1917. Thereafter, the Legislative Council of India enacted the 
Super Tax Act of 1920 which repealed the Super Tax Act of 1917. 
Till this period, the impost of tax in addition to income tax (i.e., super 
tax) was being made through separate legislative enactments until the 
Legislative Council of India, on the recommendations of the All-
Indian Income Tax Committee, consolidated income tax and tax in 
addition to income tax (i.e., super tax) in the Indian Income Tax Act, 
1922. Even though the Income Tax Act, 1922 dealt with both income 
tax and super tax, it still maintained the distinction and identities of 
the two categories of taxes, and designated a separate chapter for 
super tax, i.e., chapter IX of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922, which 
contained a distinct charging provision, and specified the definition of 
income and the exemptions applicable with respect to the computation 
of super tax. In other words, Chapter IX of the Indian Income Tax 
Act, 1922 was a self-contained chapter dealing with the charge, 
assessment, collection, and recovery of super tax. It is also worth 
noting that even though the Indian Income Tax Act. 1922 defined 
super tax as tax in addition to income tax, it did not include the same 
within income tax; the legislature, in its wisdom, clearly kept the 
separate identity of super tax maintained.  
16. 
After its independence, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan 
adopted, as is, the Income Tax Act of 1922 as its code on direct 
taxation. However, from time to time, through parliamentary 
enactments and ordinances, the charges levied, definitions, and 
computation and recovery methods were amended. Thereafter, the 
Income Tax Act of 1992 was repealed by the Income Tax Ordinance 
1979 which, with respect to the levy of super tax, adopted a similar 
scheme and maintained the super tax’s distinct and self-contained 
identity. Thereafter, the promulgation of the “Ordinance” repealed 
the Income Tax Ordinance, 1979 and super tax was reintroduced in 
the “Ordinance” through the Finance Act, 2015, by adding section 4B 

 
Writ Petition No.58683 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   18 
(super tax for rehabilitation of Temporarily Displaced Persons) that 
imposed a super tax on certain persons with retroactive effect on tax 
year 2015. Recently through the Finance Act of 2022, the Parliament 
inserted Section 4C in the “Ordinance” which imposed a super tax on 
certain high-earning persons with retroactive effect for the tax year 
2022 and onwards; except for the banking companies which were 
liable to pay super tax from the tax year 2023. 
  
ii. 
Legality of Section 4C of the “Ordinance” 
17. 
The Petitioners have agitated the applicability of Section 4C of 
the “Ordinance” retrospectively. It has been settled in plethora of 
judgments by the Superior Court that legislature is competent to give 
retrospective effect to an Act and can also take away the vested rights 
of the parties but to provide for such consequences, the Legislature 
must use words which are clear, unambiguous and not capable of any 
other interpretation or such interpretation follows as a necessary 
implication from the words used in the enactment. In order to narrow 
down the question of retrospectively, it is imperative to reproduce 
Section 4C of the “Ordinance” which reads as follows: 
4C. Super tax on high earning persons.― (1) A super 
tax shall be imposed for tax year 2022 and onwards at 
the rates specified in Division IIB of Part I of the First 
Schedule, on income of every person:  
Provided that this section shall not apply to a 
banking company for tax year 2022.  
(2) For the purposes of this section, “income” shall be 
the sum of the following:—  
(i) profit on debt, dividend, capital gains, 
brokerage and commission;  
(ii) taxable income (other than brought forward 
depreciation and brought forward business 
losses) under section 9 of the Ordinance, 
excluding amounts specified in clause (i);  
(iii) imputable income as defined in clause (28A) 
of section 2 excluding amounts specified in clause 
(i); and  
(iv) income computed, other than brought 
forward 
depreciation, 
brought 
forward 
amortization and brought forward business losses 
under Fourth, Fifth and Seventh Schedules.

(3) The tax payable under sub-section (1) shall be paid, 
collected and deposited on the date and in the manner as 
specified in sub-section (1) of section 137 and all provisions 
of Chapter X of the Ordinance shall apply.  
 
(4) Where the tax is not paid by a person liable to pay it, the 
Commissioner shall by an order in writing, determine the tax 
payable, and shall serve upon the person, a notice of demand 
specifying the tax payable and within the time specified under 
section 137 of the Ordinance.  
 
(5) Where the tax is not paid by a person liable to pay it, the 
Commissioner shall recover the tax payable under sub-section 
(1) and the provisions of Part IV, X, XI and XII of Chapter X 
and Part I of Chapter XI of the Ordinance shall, so far as may 
be, apply to the collection of tax as these apply to the 
collection of tax under the Ordinance.  
 
(6) The Board may, by notification in the official Gazette, 
make rules for carrying out the purposes of this section.]

Provided further that in case of banking companies for 
tax year 2023, the rate of tax shall be 10% where the 
income exceeds Rs. 300 million.] 
 
  
Plain reading of above section reveals that it imposes a super 
tax for the “tax year 2022 and onward” at the rates specified in above 
Division IIB on income of every high earning person. While Division 
IIB of the First Schedule provides the slabs of income brackets that 
will be put to progressive rates of super tax under section 4C; the 
proviso to Division IIB provides for a onetime levy of super tax at 
10% for the tax year 2022 on those persons involved in specific 
sectors/businesses subject to their income exceeding Rs.300 million in 
tax year 2022 only; and the second proviso to Division IIB subjects 
the banking companies to a one time levy of super tax at rate of 10% 
for the tax year 2023 subject to their income exceeding Rs. 300 
million. The said section also defines “income” as the sum of four 
heads listed in subsection 2(i) to (iv) of Section 4C of the 
“Ordinance” and proviso to the section ibid excludes the imposition 
of super tax on banking companies only for the tax year 2022. It 
further reflects that entire distinct mechanism for assessment, 
collection and recovery of super tax has been provided within the 
newly inserted section.  
18. 
Pertinently, the word “person” is defined under Section 2(42) 
which means a person as defined in Section 80, Chapter V, Part-I, 
Division-I of the “Ordinance” which reads as: 
80. Person. —(1) The following shall be treated as 
persons for the purposes of this Ordinance, namely: —  
(a) An individual;  
(b) a company or association of persons 
incorporated, formed, organised or established

(2) For the purposes of this Ordinance —  
(a) “association of persons” includes a firm, a 
Hindu undivided family, any artificial juridical 
person and anybody of persons formed under a 
foreign law, but does not include a company;

[(va) a non-profit organization;] 
[(vb) a trust, an entity or a body of

force;] 
(vi) a foreign association, whether

. 
A bare reading of above quoted section shows that it has wider 
amplitude and used in broad sense and all the Petitioners fall within 
the definition of a ‘person’ under Section 2(42) read with Section 
80(1)(b) of the “Ordinance” and their liability to pay tax for income 
tax arises under Chapter II, Section 4 of the “Ordinance”. Their 
liability to pay tax, even if created by charging provision, materialized 
upon filing of return in terms of Section 114 of the “Ordinance” 
which is treated as an assessment order under Section 120 of the 

 
Writ Petition No.58683 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   22 
“Ordinance” and procedure and method to file return is provided 
under Section 118(2) of the “Ordinance” which reads as  
 
118. Method of furnishing returns and other 
documents. — (1) A return of income under 
section 114, a wealth statement under section 116 
[or a foreign income and assets statement under 
116A, if applicable] shall be furnished in the 
prescribed manner.  
(2) A return of income [under section 114 of a 
company shall be furnished —  
(a) in the case of a company with a tax year 
ending any time between the first day of 
January and the thirtieth day of June, on or 
before the thirty-first day of December next 
following the end of the tax year to which 
the return relates; or  
(b) in any other case, on or before the 
thirtieth day of September next following the 
end of the tax year to which the return 
relates. 
 
Underlying for emphasis 
 
19. 
Plain reading of above section reveals that the Petitioners are 
at liberty to file their return at any date on or before the thirtieth day 
of September following the end of the tax year to which the return 
relates. The word Tax Year is defined in Section 74(1) of the 
“Ordinance” which reads as under:  
74. Tax year.— (1) For the purpose of this 
Ordinance and subject to this section, the tax 
year shall be a period of twelve months ending 
on the 30th day of June (hereinafter referred to 
as ‘normal tax year’) and shall, subject to sub-
section (3), be denoted by the calendar year in 
which the said date falls. 
2) Where a person’s income year, under the 
repealed Ordinance, is different from the 
normal tax year, or where a person is allowed, 
by an order under sub-section (3), to use a 
twelve months’ period different from normal 
tax year, such income year or such period 
shall be that person’s tax year (hereinafter 
referred to as ‘special tax year’) and shall, 

 
Writ Petition No.58683 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   23 
subject to sub-section (3), be denoted by the 
calendar year relevant to normal tax year in 
which the closing date of the special tax year 
falls. 
---------------------------- 
 
(3) A person may apply, in writing, to the 
Commissioner to allow him to use a twelve 
months’ period, other than normal tax year, as 
special tax year and the Commissioner may, 
subject to sub-section (5), by an order, allow 
him to use such special tax year.  
(4) A person using a special tax year, under 
sub-section (2), may apply in writing, to the 
Commissioner to allow him to use normal tax 
year and the Commissioner may, subject to 
sub-section (5), by an order, allow him to use 
normal tax year.  
(5) The Commissioner shall grant permission 
under sub-section (3) or (4) only if the person 
has shown a compelling need to use special tax 
year or normal tax year, as the case may be, 
and the permission shall be subject to such 
conditions, if any, as the Commissioner may 
impose. 
 
20.  
Perusal of above provision of law indicates that two types of 
tax years have been defined; one is normal tax year while the other is 
special tax year whereas period of both of tax years in terms of above 
referred section would be twelve months as held in the case of 
“LOTTE PAKISTAN PTA Ltd. through Chief Financial Officer and 
Company Secretary Versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through 
Secretary Ministry of Finance, Islamabad and others” (2011 PTD 
2229), where it has been held that “normal tax year shall be a period 
of twelve months' ending on the 30th day of June and where the tax 
year of a person changes as a result of subsections (2), (3) or (5), the 
period between the last full tax year prior to the change and the date 
on which the changed tax year commences shall be treated as a 
separate tax year, to be known as the "transitional year". The same 
view was later on reaffirmed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the 
case of “FBR through Chairman, Islamabad and others Versus 

 
Writ Petition No.58683 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   24 
Messrs WAZIR ALI AND COMPANY and others” (2020 SCMR 
959) by holding that “tax year is specifically defined in section 74 
of the 2001 Ordinance which means a period of twelve months. This 
period normally ends on 30th June and may also end on any other 
date in case the same is allowed by the competent authority to be 
adopted. Nevertheless, a tax year under section 74 of the 2001 
Ordinance has to be of twelve months. It is for this reason that 
section 114 of the 2001 Ordinance under which return of income is 
required to be filed covers entire tax year”.  
21. 
From the aforesaid observation, it would be quite easy to 
understand that normal tax year denotes a period of twelve months 
ending on 30th day of June i.e. the financial year and also denoted by 
the calendar year in which the said date falls. For instance, tax year 
for the period of twelve months from 01.07.2020 to 30.06.2021 shall 
be denoted by calendar year 2021 and the period of twelve months 
from 01.07.2021 to 30.06.2022 shall be denoted by calendar year 
2022. Likewise, a special tax year would also mean a period of twelve 
months and is denoted by the calendar year relevant to the Normal 
Tax Year in which closing date of the Special Tax Year falls. For 
instance, Tax Year for the period of twelve months from 01.01.2019 
to 31.12.2019 shall be denoted by calendar year 2020 and the period 
of twelve months from 01.10.2019 to 30.09.2020 shall be denoted by 
calendar year 2020. The case of many of the Petitioners is that as their 
normal and special years ended on 30.06.2021 and 31.12.2021 
therefore, super tax imposed through Section 4C of the “Ordinance” 
is not applicable under the principle of past and closed transaction. It 
is an admitted position between the parties that many a Petitioners 
operate under normal tax year in terms of Section 74(1) of the 
“Ordinance” while others operate under Section 74(3) of the 
“Ordinance” availing special tax year and availing of such special 
year is subject to applying in writing to the Commissioner to use a 
twelve months’ period other than normal tax years and that 
permission is further subject to Section 74(5) of the “Ordinance” 

 
Writ Petition No.58683 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   25 
therefore, availing any special tax year for payment tax liability is just 
to accommodate that category of Petitioners and not for the purpose to 
evade the payment of income tax due in a normal tax year. Moreover, 
the liability to pay tax crystalizes on the day when the returns are filed 
while the mode and manner is further specified under Section 137(1) 
and all provisions of Chapter X of the “Ordinance” which states that 
“The tax payable by a taxpayer on the taxable income of the taxpayer 
[including the tax payable under section [113 or] 113A] for a tax 
year shall be due on the due date for furnishing the taxpayer’s return 
of income for that year”. Notably, Section 4C Division IIB was 
inserted in the “Ordinance” through the Finance Act 2022 passed on 
30.06.2022 effective from 01.07.2022. The sole ground as agitated by 
the Petitioners is that this amendment does not apply retrospectively 
as their tax year 2022 ended on 30.06.2022 and 31.12.2022 thus 
becomes absolute and past and closed transaction. It is observed that 
computation of any taxable income as self-assessed and declared by a 
taxpayer, is subject to scrutiny and assessment in terms of Section 111 
and 122 of the “Ordinance” and may further be reassessed and 
amended for a period of five consecutive tax periods/years. In this 
regard, section 122(2) of the “Ordinance” empowered the 
Respondents to amend taxpayers’ assessment upto five successive 
years and mere reflecting the internal accounting income that is 
worked out as per International Accounting Standards and is reported 
in annual accounts is different from computation of taxable income. 
Therefore, the return of income can only be considered a past and 
closed transaction after the lapse of statutory five years limitation 
period. So, the conclusion can easily be drawn that the effective date 
of Section 4C of the “Ordinance” i.e. 01.07.2022 includes the tax 
period 01.07.2021 to 30.06.2022 during which the tax liability 
accrued and same was to be paid till thirtieth day of September as per 
normal tax year and that of 31st December if availed as concession 
with regard to special tax year.

22. 
In view of above, while applying Doctrine of Textualism 
which envisages a method of statutory interpretation that asserts a 
statute should be interpreted according to its plain meaning and not 
according to the intent of the legislature, the statutory purpose, or the 
legislative history. If we examine Section 4C of the “Ordinance”, 
under the Doctrine of Textualism it clearly means that the intent of 
Section 4C be looked into rather than the intent of legislature because 
the wording used are defined under Section 2 and cross-referred to 
other sections which is very comprehensive with Part, Chapters to the 
“Ordinance”. Keeping in view the plain text of Section 4C of the 
“Ordinance”, supported tax documents, examining of constitutional 
provisions more specifically Article 80, 140 read with Article 260 
which defines “financial year”, the relevant charging sections of the 
“Ordinance” and Chapters and Parts, the policy statement as well as 
the judgments of Supreme Court of Pakistan, mentioned above, the 
Petitioners are only liable to pay Super Tax at the rate mentioned in 
Division IIB of Part I of the First Schedule of the “Ordinance”, and 
4% as reduced by the Supreme Court in its order dated 16.02.2023. 
Learned counsel for the Respondents, when confronted with situation, 
were unable to satisfy the Court regarding 10% rate of super tax. 
  
iii. 
Discrimination 
23. 
So far as the argument of the Petitioners with regard to 
discrimination is concerned, it is noted that while imposing super tax 
under Section 4B of the “Ordinance”, it appears that uniform rate of 
super tax upon the same class of person i.e. (i) Banking Companies @ 
4% and (ii) Person, other than a banking Company having income 
equal to or exceeding to Rs.500 Million (Rupees Five Hundred 
Million) @ 3% has been imposed without any discrimination within 
the same class. But from perusal of Division IIB, Column 5, reveals 
that maximum rate of super was fixed at 4% where the income exceed 
Rs.300 million while in 1st Proviso, added to Division IIB of Part I of 
the First Schedule of the “Ordinance”, which create a further sub-
classification, the persons engaged, wholly/partly, in the businesses of 

 
Writ Petition No.58683 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   27 
airlines, automobiles, beverages, cement, chemicals, cigarette and 
tobacco, fertilizer, iron and steel, LNG terminal, oil marketing, oil 
refining, 
petroleum 
and 
gas 
exploration 
and 
production, 
pharmaceuticals, sugar and textiles, were held liable to pay super 
tax at the rate of 10% where the income exceeds Rs. 300 million 
which, of course, is more than the double rate as compared to 
column No.5 of Division IIB of Part I of the First Schedule. 
Therefore, the said proviso is found to be prima facie discriminatory 
and the learned counsel for the Respondents remained unable to 
demonstrate any intelligible differentia therein, having rational 
nexus with the object of classification.  
24. 
It is by now well settled law that although Article 25 of the 
Constitution allows for differential treatment of persons who are 
not similarly placed under a reasonable classification but it is also 
equally settled that in order to justify this difference in treatment 
the reasonable classification must be based on intelligible 
differentia that has a rational nexus with the object being sought to 
be achieved. This means that any distinct treatment meted out to a 
class of persons can only be sustained under Article 25 if the 
aforesaid test is satisfied as held by Supreme Court in the case of 
“HADAYAT ULLAH and others Versus FEDERATION OF 
PAKISTAN and others” (2022 SCMR 1691). Earlier in the case of 
“Dr. MOBASHIR HASSAN and others Versus FEDERATION OF 
PAKISTAN and others” (PLD 2010 Supreme Court 265) the 
Supreme Court held that in order to establish a reasonable 
classification based on intelligible differentia, the differentiation 
must have been understood logically and there should not be any 
artificial grouping for specific purpose causing injustice to other 
similarly placed individuals. Similarly in the case of “Syed AZAM 
SHAH Versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through Secretary 
Cabinet Division, Cabinet Secretariat, Islamabad and another” 
(2022 SCMR 201) the Supreme Court observed as follows: “The 
catchphrase "intelligible differentia" connotes dissimilarity or 

 
Writ Petition No.58683 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   28 
disparity capable of being comprehended. The classification must 
be based on an intelligible differentia which should distinguish the 
persons that are grouped together from others left out of the group 
and the differentia or categorization/ cataloguing must have a 
logical and commonsensical nexus with the object sought to be 
achieved. The concept of reasonableness is rationally a 
fundamental component of equality or non-arbitrariness.” It was 
further held in the case of “GOVERNMENT OF KHYBER 
PAKHTUNKHWA through Chief Secretary and others Versus Syed 
SADIQ SHAH and others” (2021 SCMR 747) that “It must always 
rest upon some real and substantial distinction bearing a just and 
reasonable relation to the object sought to be achieved by the 
authority. It is now well-established law that persons may be 
classified or further sub-classified into entities and such entities 
may be treated differently if there is a reasonable basis for such 
difference. Article 25 forbids class legislation but it does not forbid 
classification or differentiation which rests upon reasonable 
grounds of distinction. The classification however must not be 
arbitrary, artificial or evasive but must be based on some real and 
substantial bearing, a just and reasonable relation to the object 
sought to be achieved by the legislation.” The Court further held 
that “In order to pass the test for permissible classification two 
conditions must be fulfilled i.e. (i) the classification must be 
founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons 
or things those are grouped together from others left out of the 
group, (ii) the intelligible differentia must have a rational nexus 
with the object sought to be achieved. However it must disclose that 
there must be a substantial basis for making the classification and 
there should be a nexus between the basis of classification and the 
object of action under consideration based upon justiciable 
reasonings.”  
25. 
Keeping the aforesaid pronouncements of Supreme Court of 
Pakistan, the said proviso is found to be prima facie discriminatory 

 
Writ Petition No.58683 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   29 
and the learned counsel for the Respondents remained unable to 
demonstrate any intelligible differentia therein, having rational 
nexus with the object of classification. Moreover, the creation of 
said separate category/sub-classification of persons under the 1st 
proviso to Division IIB of Part I of the First Schedule of the 
“Ordinance” tantamount to creation of artificial grouping leading 
to arbitrariness.  
26. 
It is also pertinent to mention here that the super tax imposed 
for persons other than banking company having income equal to or 
exceeding Rs.500 million were gradually reduced between years 
2018 to 2022 from 3% to 0% as per Division IIA of the “Ordinance” 
while at the same time, a new super tax was imposed through Section 
4C of the “Ordinance” and as per Division IIB, an exorbitant and 
sudden increase in super tax @ 10% (which is equal to 250% 
increase from normal maximum rates of super tax) was imposed 
which is unreasonable and unjustified as compared to super tax 
earlier imposed through Section 4B of the “Ordinance”. The Sindh 
High Court in “SHELL PAKISTAN LIMITED through Legal Counsel 
and others Versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through Secretary 
Ministry of Finance and others” (2023 PTD 607 Sindh) while 
relying on “Messrs LUCKY CEMENT LTD. through General 
Manager, Peshawar Versus KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA through 
Secretary Local Government and Rural Development, Peshawar and 
others” (2022 SCMR 1994) observed in paragraph No.38 observed 
that “So as a consequence of the Proviso, a person subject to tax at 
the designated rate would automatically become liable to a tax rate 
two hundred and fifty percent (250%) higher simply because of being 
partly/wholly engaged in the business listed therein”. This Court is 
also in agreement with the observation made by the Supreme Court 
of Pakistan in the case of “Lucky Cement” supra whereby the 
differentiation was struck down on the basis of observation made 
herein below:  

 
Writ Petition No.58683 of 2022

6. 
Article 25 of the Constitution mandates equality 
before the law and Article 18 of the Constitution secures the 
right to conduct any lawful trade or business. If both these 
Articles are read together and applied to the present case it 
means that the appellant cannot be made to face a more 
onerous tax regime than its competitors. It would be 
appropriate to reproduce applicable extracts from the five-
member Bench decision of this Court in the case of I.A. 
Sharwani v. Government of Pakistan.6 
 
'(i) that equal protection of law does not envisage that 
every citizen is to be treated alike in all circumstances, 
but it contemplates that persons similarly situated or 
similarly placed are to be treated alike; 
 
(ii) that reasonable classification is permissible but it 
must be founded on reasonable distinction or 
reasonable basis;' 
 
'(v) that a law applying to one person or one class of 
persons may be constitutionally valid if there is 
sufficient basis or reason for it, but a classification 
which is arbitrary and is not founded on any rational 
basis is no classification as to warrant its exclusion 
from the mischief of Article 25; 
 
(vi) that equal protection of law means that all persons 
equally placed be treated alike both in privileges 
conferred and liabilities imposed; 
 
(vii) that in order to make a classification reasonable, 
it should be based- 
 
(a) on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes 
persons or things that are grouped together from those 
who have been left out; 
 
(b) that the differentia must have rational nexus to 
the object sought to be achieved by such classification.' 
 
27. 
Keeping in view the history of super tax, it is observed that 
although super tax imposed through Section 4A of the “Ordinance” 
yet it was later on withdrawn, while the rate of super tax imposed 
under Section 4B, was gradually reduced from 2018 to 2022 as 
mentioned in Division IIA, hence following the above said disparity 
regarding imposition of super tax over the recent years, rate of 10% 
super tax is held to be discriminatory hence is reduced to 4%.  
28. 
When confronted to learned counsel for the Respondents what 
is the basis of imposing 10% super tax because already the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in its order dated 16.02.2023 in paragraph No.4 has 
reduced the rate of super tax from 10% to 4% and the Sindh High 

 
Writ Petition No.58683 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   31 
Court in paragraph No.38 of its judgment also observed the increase 
in super tax @ 10% i.e. two hundred and fifty percent higher than the 
ordinary maximum rate of super tax for all other categories, the 
counsel for the Respondents could not give any satisfactorily reply 
and the same was the situation before the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
as is evident from order dated 16.02.2023 whereby it was observed 
that “the learned counsel for the Petitioner submits that the said 
agreement cannot form the basis of altogether striking down the 
impugned Super Tax because implicitly the respondents’ argument 
accepts liability to taxation at the rate of 4%. However, he is not able 
to explain to us the justification for charging super tax at a higher 
rate for industries specified in the first proviso”.  
29. 
In view of the determination made above and relying on the 
judgments of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, doctrine of textualism, 
relevant charging provisions of the “Ordinance”, and the documents 
examined by this court through C.M.No.01 of 2023 including budget 
speech, policy statement, writ petitions are partially allowed to the 
extent that First Proviso to Division IIB of Part I of the First Schedule 
of the “Ordinance” is declared to be discriminatory, hence, ultra vires 
to the “Constitution” and thus the rate of super tax is reduced to 4% 
from 10%. Rest of the prayers made in the petitions are declined being 
super tax as valid.
