at Behni Road Jhugian at about 04:00/15 p.m., all of a sudden accused 
Muhammad Ashraf, Muhammad Sarwar, Muhammad Anwar, Abdul 
Rehman, Muhammad Ashraf, Muhammad Afzaal @ Jalu, Shabbir Hussain, 
Naseer Ahmed, Faqir Hussain and Imran alongwith 3/4 unknown accused 
while armed with fire arms emerged there from both sides of the road.

upon Zulfiqar (deceased), which landed at various parts of his body. 
Accused Muhammad Sarwar opened straight fire shots with his firearm, 
which landed at the head and various parts of body of Allah Ditta (deceased)

and Younas kissed the dust in the hospital, whereas injured Yousaf breathed 
his last after three days of occurrence in the hospital.  Muhammad Yousaf, 
Muhammad Yasin and Muhammad Bashir luckily survived.  
 
Motive behind the occurrence was that accused Muhammad Anwar

under Sections 302, 148 & 149 PPC, registered at Police Station Manawan, 
Lahore qua the murder of his brother Safdar and due to that reason the 
accused persons, in connivance with each other and with the active abetment 
of Sardar Ahmed, Faqir Hussain, Muhammad Asghar and Shah Muhammad 
committed this occurrence.

regarding operation notes of deceased Muhammad Yousaf, injured

7. 
At the commencement of trial, the trial Court framed a charge against 
the appellants to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.   
  
8. 
The prosecution examined 31-witnesses besides the reports of Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency Ex.PHHHH/1 to Ex.PHHHH/3 and Chemical 
Examiner Ex.PJJJJ/1 to Ex.PJJJJ/5. The appellants, in their statements 
recorded under Section 342 Cr.P.C., had denied and controverted all the 
allegations of facts leveled against them.  They did not opt to make 
statement under Section 340(2) Cr.P.C., however, produced certain 
documents in their defence. 
9. 
Learned trial Court, upon conclusion of the trial, proceed to acquit    
co-accused Sardar Ahmed, Faqir Hussain, Muhammad Asghar and Shah 
Muhammad whereas convicted and sentenced the appellants, as stated 
above, vide impugned judgment dated 21.04.2018.  Hence, these criminal 
appeals as well as connected Murder Reference.  
10. 
Learned counsels for the appellants have unanimously submitted that 
the appellants are quite innocent and have nothing to do with the alleged 
occurrence; that the complainant, being chance witness, could not establish 
her presence at the venue of occurrence, who had no occasion to be present 
there at the relevant time; that all the prosecution witnesses were closely 
related to the deceased persons and as such their testimony cannot be relied 
upon; that two independent witnesses namely, Zubair Akhtar and Asghar 

M.R. No.189/2018

were not produced and given up by the prosecution before the trial Court, 
which shows that they were not ready to support the prosecution version 
being false one; that all the eye witnesses including the injured witness, 
made material improvements in their statements before the trial Court and 
made contradicting statements, which is not worth reliance; that there was 
delay of 16-24-hours in conducting respective post mortem examination on 
the dead body of all the deceased and as such the inference could be drawn 
that the prosecution took such a long time in order to manage the eye 
witnesses; that there was delay of two days in recording statements of 
injured witnesses under Section 161 Cr.P.C., which has lost its credence; 
that the recovery of weapons of offence at the instance of appellants 
Muhammad Anwar, Abdul Rehman, Muhammad Afzal @ Jalu and 
Muhammad Sarwar remained inconsequential; that all the prosecution 
witnesses admitted during the course of cross-examination that both the 
parties were on visiting terms, as such the motive as set out by the 
prosecution has become immaterial. At the end, prayer has been made for 
acquittal of the appellants.  
11. 
Conversely, learned Deputy Prosecutor General appearing for the 
State assisted by learned counsels for the complainant has vehemently 
contended that it was a broad-day light occurrence, which was promptly 
reported to the police containing names of the appellants with the specific 
role of committing murder of five innocent persons and causing injuries to 
two others; that the complainant has well explained her presence at the 
venue of occurrence, which could not be shattered by the defence during her 
cross-examination; that both the parties were previously known to each other 
and as such question of misidentification of the real culprits does not arise; 
that the injured witnesses were shifted to the hospital prior to the arrival of 
Investigating Officer as such their statements could not be recorded at the 
venue of occurrence; that the Investigating Officer did not visit the hospital 
where the injured PWs were admitted, as such delay in recording of their 
statements was not fatal in the instant case; that the eye witnesses remained 
firm and consistent on all material aspects of the case coupled with the 
medical evidence; that delay in conducting post mortem examination was 
due to non-availability of the doctors; that there was no occasion for the 

M.R. No.189/2018 
Crl. Appeal Nos.204964, 204976, 204982, 204979, 204969,

prosecution to falsely involve the appellants while letting off the real 
culprits; that the prosecution produced cogent, convincing and confidence 
inspiring evidence and prove the charge against the appellants beyond 
shadow of reasonable doubt. In the end, a prayer has been made for 
dismissal of the appeals and confirmation of death sentence and also 
enhancement of sentence of appellants Shabbir Hussain, Muhammad Imran 
and Naseer Ahmad.  
12. 
We have heard learned counsels for the appellants, learned Deputy 
Prosecutor General appearing for the State assisted by learned counsels for 
the complainant and perused the record with their able assistance.  
13. 
This unfortunate incident took place on 23.06.2010 at about 04:15 
p.m., which was reported to the police promptly on the same day at about 
05:35 p.m. within one hour and twenty minutes and formal FIR (Ex.PV) was 
chalked out at 05:55 p.m., despite the fact that inter-se distance between the 
place of occurrence and the police station was seven kilometers containing 
names of the appellants with their specific role of making fire shots at the 
deceased as well as the injured witnesses, which not only confirms presence 
of the eye witnesses at the spot but also excludes every hypothesis of 
deliberation, consultation and fabrication prior to the registration of the case 
and also rules out the possibility of mistaken identification or substitution. 
Reliance is placed on case reported as Noor Sultan and others ..Vs.. The 
State (2021 SCMR 176), wherein it has been laid down as under:- 
“The instant occurrence has taken place on 6.15 p.m. while the matter was 
reported to the police within 2.15 hours whereas inter-se distance between 
the place of occurrence and police station is 16 kilometers. Promptness in 
reporting the matter to the police reflect that there is no chance of 
consultation or deliberation at the part of the prosecution.” 
Similarly, in case reported as Shaheen Ijaz alias Babu ..Vs.. The State 
(2021 SCMR 500), it has been laid down as under:- 
“…..petitioner’s nomination in a broad day light incident by resident 
witnesses hardly admits a space to entertain any hypothesis of mistaken 
identity or substitution. Prompt recourse to law straight at the police station 
excludes every possibility of deliberation or consultation.” 
In case reported as Muhammad Waris ..Vs.. The State (2008 SCMR 784) it

has been laid down as under:- 
“The names of the said two eye-witnesses could not have been mentioned in such 
a promptly lodged F.I.R. if they had not been with the deceased persons at the 
time of their death.” 
14. 
The motive is considered as an essential ingredient to provide 
foundation to any crime. Admittedly, there was a previous murder enmity 
between the parties and prior to this incident, a case FIR No.273/07 dated 
03.06.2007, in respect of offence under Sections 302, 148 & 149 PPC was 
got lodged by one of the appellants namely, Muhammad Anwar qua the 
murder of his brother Safdar against deceased Allah Ditta, Muhammad 
Younis, Muhammad Said, Zulfiqar Ali and injured Muhammad Yasin. 
During investigation of said case, all the deceased persons were found 
innocent and report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. (Ex.PKKK/1-4) was 
submitted by placing their names in column No.2 thereof, whereas, injured 
Muhammad Yasin (PW-3) was sent up to the Court for trial being sole 
perpetrator of the said murder. Being dissatisfied with the investigation, 
appellant Muhammad Anwar filed a private complaint (Ex.PLLL/1-13) 
against the deceased persons and injured PW.  It is also an admitted fact that 
said case was pending adjudication before the trial Court and on the day of 
occurrence, the same was fixed for hearing. Learned counsels for the 
appellants has referred certain portions of admissions of the complainant 
(PW-1) during her cross-examination that      “We were on visiting terms 
with each other and in the said period there was no quarrel/difference inter-
se……The accused persons remained using the said passage in routine and 
no quarrel took place on the said passage in between my brothers and 
accused persons…… We all the family members i.e. sisters, brothers, 
parents, used to visit the complainant party of Safdar deceased. During our 
visits none of the accused ever assaulted us…… Zulfiqar was running an 
Agency of Fertilizer etc.  Accused used to purchase agricultural 
commodities from Zulfiqar, amicably” and argued that in the light of such 
admissions, it cannot be said that this incident was result of previous FIR.  
These admissions also raised our eye-brows for a moment but while going 
through the entire evidence, it came on surface that the learned defence 
counsel have skipped the most pivotal portion of the statement of the 

M.R. No.189/2018 
Crl. Appeal Nos.204964, 204976, 204982, 204979, 204969,

complainant, whereby she explained that “We sought pardon from the 
accused persons regarding the said murder soon after the occurrence and 
we remained seeking asking for pardon for about three years.”  It is a matter 
of record that request of the complainant party for pardon was never acceded 
to by the accused side.  Had relationship between the parties was of such a 
pleasant nature, the parties would have been entered into compromise in the 
previous murder case.  Developing cordial relations with the accused 
persons might be an effort of the complainant party in order to seek pardon 
from earlier case but it remained futile.  It is important to note that in the 
aforesaid case, defence side booked five accused persons, out of which four 
were declared innocent at the stage of investigation and they were on bail, 
whereas, injured Muhammad Yasin (PW-3) was behind the bars, who was 
granted post arrest bail by this Court vide order dated 03.06.2010 passed in 
Crl.Misc.No.4398-B-2010 (Ex.PMMMM/1-1).  This unfortunate occurrence 
took place just after twenty days of release of said Muhammad Yasin from 
the jail.  We have entertained no manner of doubt in our mind that release of 
injured Muhammad Yasin (PW-3) added fuel to the fire and after this 
development, the appellants organized a plan and took revenge from the 
complainant party. No doubt previous enmity, being motive, is always 
considered as a double edged weapon but from the evidence available on 
record it has been established that it was the sole reason of this unfortunate 
incident.  With this backdrop, we are persuaded to hold that the prosecution 
has successfully proved motive part of the occurrence through oral as well as 
documentary evidence.

Mst. Rani Bibi (PW-1)/complainant furnished the ocular account 
before the trial Court and reiterated the contents of the crime report deposing 
that on the fateful day she alongwith her brothers Allah Ditta, Muhammad 
Saif, Zulfiqar Ali, Muhammad Yousaf, Muhammad Yasin, nephew Younas 
and husband Bashir went to attend the court proceedings in a criminal case 
on a Daala (double cabin).  Zubair Akhtar and Asghar PWs followed them 
on a motorcycle. After attending the court proceedings, on the way to home, 
when they reached near Jehangir Cold Store at Behni Road at about 
04:00/15 p.m., all the accused persons 12/13 in numbers, including accused 
Ashraf s/o Asghar, (since acquitted on the basis of compromise) Ashraf s/o

Muhammad Din (since dead), Afzaal @ Jaalo, Sarwar, Abdul, Anwar, 
Shabir, Naseer and Imran while armed with fire arm weapons, emerged there 
from both sides. Accused Ashraf s/o Asghar (since acquitted) raised a 
Lalkara to kill all of them and opened firing upon Zulfiqar deceased, which 
landed at various parts of his body. Appellant Afzaal @ Jalu, made fire shots 
upon Zulfiqar and Muhammad Yasin at different parts of their bodies, 
Accused Ashraf s/o Muhammad Din (since dead) made fire shots upon at 
different parts of body of deceased Muhammad Yousaf, appellant Abdul 
caused fire arm injuries to deceased Younas, appellant Sarwar caused fire 
arm injuries to deceased Allah Ditta, appellant Anwar made fire shots at 
deceased Said, appellant Shabbir caused fire arm injuries to injured 
Muhammad Bashir (PW-2), whereas appellants Naseer and Imran were 
collectively attributed the role of making fire shots upon all the above 
victims. The appellants, while making random firing upon vehicle of the 
complainant party, succeeded to flee away towards river Ravi. Said and 
Zulfiqar succumbed to the injuries at the spot, Allah Ditta and Younas at the 
hospital on the same day, while deceased Yousaf breathed his last after three 
days of occurrence in the hospital. Muhammad Bashir, (PW-2) and 
Muhammad Yaseen (PW-3)/injured witnesses deposed exactly in line and 
supplemented the complainant on each and every minute detail of the 
incident of murder in issue. In the course of cross-examination, all the 
witnesses of ocular account remained firm and consistent on all material 
aspects of the incident qua the date, time, place, mode and manner of the 
occurrence, names of the appellants, weapons of offence, role played by 
each and every accused for committing murder of the deceased and causing 
injuries to the injured witnesses and the defence could not extract any 
favourable material from their mouths.   
 
Learned defence counsels laid much emphasis that the complainant 
was neither accused in the criminal case, which was fixed on the fateful day 
nor she sustained even a scratch on her body and as such her presence at the 
venue of occurrence was highly doubtful.  We are not in agreement with the 
submission of learned defence counsels for the reason that during cross-
examination, complainant explained that she alongwith her husband Bashir 
Ahmad (PW-2) intended to pay homage to Data Darbar at Lahore and as

such they accompanied the deceased, who had to attend the Court 
proceedings there.This is a very valid reason and cannot be sighted with 
doubt. Even otherwise, on this point the defence has questioned the 
complainant at a considerable length but she remained firm and consistent 
and even gave minute details of description of floor, mosque, path and even 
colour and height of shrine and the defence remained fail to shake her 
testimony on this point. So far as non-sustaining of injuries by the 
complainant lady while all other members present in the Daala had 
sustained injuries, is concerned, we have gone through the back-ground of 
the incident.  Initially, brother of appellant Muhammad Anwar was 
murdered and four of the deceased persons as well as one injured (PW-3) 
were booked in the said case. The deceased persons were declared innocent 
by the police, whereas, injured Muhammad Yasin (PW-3) was released on 
post arrest bail after more than three years of his arrest. After his release, the 
appellants hatched a plan of taking revenge and tried to commit murder of 
entire male members of their opponents.  Leaving the complainant scratch-
less, appears to be a calculated move on part of the appellants to make her an 
example and let her alone to feel the pain and misery of departure of her dear 
ones. They were very much aware that in our society, a female, howsoever 
strong may be, always remains unable to take them a task in the Courts and 
as such leaving her alive is not of significance for them. Even otherwise, if 
the prosecution intended to manage/procure a complainant, a male member 
ought to be given preference because generally, in our rural set up, people 
avoid to drag their females in criminal litigation. The crime report was 
lodged with sufficient promptitude, and the complainant faced the test of 
lengthy cross-examination from time to time spreading the period of over 
three years with full confidence and described the gruesome incident in a 
minute detail, which established her presence at the venue of occurrence at 
the relevant time without any doubt. Even if for the sake of arguments, 
testimony of the said witness is excluded from consideration even then it 
would not helpful to the defence. In the matter of appreciation of the 
evidence it is not the number of witnesses rather quality of evidence is worth 
importance.  There is no requirement under the law that a particular number 
of witnesses are necessary to prove/disprove a fact. It is time honoured

principle that evidence must be weighed and not counted.  Reliance is placed 
on case titled “NIAZ-UD-DIN and another Versus THE STATE and 
another” (2011 SCMR 725), 
“The statement of Israel (PW.9) the eye-witness of the occurrence 
is confidence inspiring, which stand substantiated from the 
circumstances and other evidence. There is apt observations 
appearing in Allah Bakhsh v. Shammi and others (PLD 1980 SC 
225) that even in a murder case conviction can be based on the 
testimony of a single witness, if the Court is satisfied that he is 
reliable.  The reason being that it is the quality of evidence and not 
the quantity which matters.”    
 
16. 
Muhammad Bashir (PW-2) and Muhammad Yasin (PW-3), sustained 
injuries during the occurrence and as such their presence at the venue of 
occurrence at the relevant time cannot be questioned in any manner. They 
appeared in the dock before the trial Court and categorically raised accusing 
finger towards none else but the appellants being responsible for the murder 
of five innocent persons and causing fire arm injuries to the injured 
witnesses. Both these witnesses faced the test of lengthy cross-examination 
with full confidence, which could not be crushed by the defence in any 
manner with even a slight difference.  The statement of both the said 
witnesses rather is sufficient to believe the prosecution version and bring 
home guilt against the appellants beyond shadow of even slightest doubt.  
17. 
Though all the witnesses of ocular account were closely related to the 
deceased inasmuch as the complainant is their real sister/aunt, whereas, 
Muhammad Yasin (PW-3), their real brother/uncle & Muhammad Bashir 
(PW-2), their brother-in-law/husband of complainant yet their testimony 
cannot be discarded merely on this score by treating them interested 
witnesses. Both the injured witnesses sustained injuries during the 
occurrence and as has been discussed supra the complainant has also 
established that she was accompanying the deceased at the relevant time, as 
such they were quite natural witnesses, who can conveniently describe the 
incident in the manner as it happened as compared to any other independent 
witness.  There was no earthly reason for the eye witnesses to falsely 
implicate the appellants in substitution of the real culprits.  Even otherwise, 

M.R. No.189/2018

substitution of the real culprits with an innocent one, in particular, where the 
eye-witnesses have lost their close kith and kin, is a rare phenomenon.  It is 
well established principle in criminal administration of justice that mere 
relationship of the eye-witnesses with the deceased is not sufficient to 
discard their evidence, if the same was otherwise found confidence inspiring 
and trustworthy.  Reliance is placed on case reported as “Ghulam Murtaza 
Versus. The State” (2021 SCMR 149). 
18. 
Next objection of the defence was that two independent witnesses 
namely, Zubair Akhtar and Asghar mentioned in the crime report were given 
up by the prosecution, so the inference could be drawn that they were not 
ready to support the prosecution version. This submission is repelled. It is 
well settled by now that the prosecution is not bound to produce all the 
witnesses. If the appellants were sure that these witnesses were not ready to 
support the prosecution witnesses, they had ample opportunity rather at 
liberty to examine them in their defence or even submit application before 
the trial Court to summon them as Court Witnesses but merely on that basis 
other overwhelming and confidence inspiring prosecution evidence cannot 
be discarded. Reliance is placed on case reported as “Saeed Akhtar and 
others ..Vs.. The State” (2000 SCMR 383).  
19. 
It has been emphatically argued by learned counsels for the appellants 
that there was delay of two days in recording the statements of the injured 
witnesses under Section 161 Cr.P.C., which impinges their credibility. No 
doubt delay in recording statements of the eye-witnesses is mostly seen with 
doubt but here in the instant case situation is quite different. In this 
unfortunate incident seven persons sustained fire arm injuries, out of which 
two breathed their last at the spot, whereas, rest were in semi-conscious 
condition.  In such scenario, the natural human reaction should be to make 
all out efforts to save the lives of injured persons despite being in the 
condition of sorrow and anguish due to death of close kith and kin.  The 
same has been done in the instant case and with the available opportunity all 
the five injured persons were shifted to the hospital.  This fact was admitted 
by Muhammad Nawaz, SI/ Investigating Officer (PW-26) in the following 
terms:- 

M.R. No.189/2018

“When I reached the place of occurrence, two dead bodies were found lying in the 
double cabin Daala. It is correct that except these dead bodies, no other injured and 
deceased was lying there. Volunteered stated that rest of the injured persons were already 
shifted to the hospital prior to my arrival over there.” 
We have minutely examined medico legal certificates of both the injured 
PWs. According to the MLC of injured Muhammad Bashir (Ex.PGGG), he 
was brought to the hospital in semi-conscious condition on the day of 
occurrence at about 05:26 p.m. Similarly, according to MLC of injured 
Muhammad Yaseen (Ex.PHHH), he was also brought to the hospital on the 
same day in semi-conscious condition.  Though the time of his arrival does 
not find mentioned in the medical report yet keeping in view his semi-
conscious condition, it can safely be presumed that he was also shifted to the 
hospital soon after the occurrence. Now, when the Investigating Officer 
admitted that both the injured persons were shifted to hospital prior to his 
arrival, it was his duty to visit the hospital for the purpose of recording their 
statements but he while appearing in the witness box conceded that he 
visited Mayo Hospital for the purpose of recording statements of the injured 
persons after two days of the occurrence.  In this unfortunate case, all the 
male members of the complainant had either lost their lives or were admitted 
in the hospital being in injured condition and, thus, it is not expected for a 
sole female household lady to herself make arrangements for recording the 
statement of the injured witnesses. Even otherwise, neither the Medical 
Officer, who medically examined the injured PWs, observed any kind of 
fabrication or friendly-hand injury nor the appellants made any effort to 
challenge their medico-legal reports at any forum.  It can be safely 
concluded that both the injured witnesses sustained injuries during the 
occurrence and if there was any lapse due to act of the investigating officer 
for recording their statements under Section 161 Cr.P.C. belatedly, its 
benefit cannot be extended to the defence in any eventuality. Reliance is 
placed on case reported as “Sheraz Asghar ..Vs.. The State” (1995 SCMR 
1365), wherein it has been observed that 
 “Besides 
any 
irregularity 
committed 
during 
the 
investigation of case would neither affect the trial of the 
case nor the judgment passed by the Courts.”

Learned defence counsels have pointed out certain contradictions in 
the statements of the prosecution witnesses claiming it to be material one but 
the same cannot be taken as material. No doubt there are slight discrepancies 
amongst the statements of the PWs but the same are of no significance for 
the reasons that the first and foremost impression, which gathers from the 
testimonies of said witnesses is that they are rustic witnesses. They were 
subjected to cross-examination for a long period of eleven days, which span 
over three years. It is well settled principal of criminal administration of 
justice that the witnesses who were subjected to fatiguing, taxing and tiring 
cross-examination for days together are bound to get confused and made 
some inconsistent statements, therefore, discrepancies cited by learned 
defence counsels should not be blown out of proportion. Specific attribution 
against the appellants by the eye-witnesses in their statements and deposition 
was exactly the same as mentioned in the rough site plan prepared by the 
police at the spot in the first visit which means that they never changed their 
stance qua the role of the appellants played at the spot for committing 
murder of five innocent persons and injuries to two others.  We are of the 
considered view that there is no contradiction amongst the statements of the 
PWs, which would shatter the case of the prosecution. It is well settled by 
now that the discrepancies of minor character which neither go to the root of 
the prosecution version nor shake its salient features are of no significance. 
Reliance in this regard is placed on case reported as Ansar and others ..Vs.. 
The State and others (2023 SCMR 929).

Dr. Muhammad Iqbal Ghani (PW-5) held autopsy on the dead body of 
deceased Allah Ditta on 24.06.2010 at about 12.15 p.m. and observed 
injuries at the top of head, front of right upper arm, front of abdomen, right 
iliac fossa, right hip and inner aspect of upper aspect of left leg.  According 
to the opinion of medical expert, all the injuries were ante-mortem, caused 
by fire arm and injury No.1 was sufficient to cause death in ordinary course 
of nature. Probable duration between injuries and death was immediate, 
whereas, between death and post mortem examination, it was 17 to 24 hours. 
 
On the same day, he also held autopsy on the dead body of deceased 
Muhammad Younis at 01:15 p.m. and observed injuries on front of his left 
shoulder, front of left upper chest, front of root of neck, antero-latera part of

right upper chest, right upper arm, back of right chest, right upper chest, 
back of left chest, antero lateral part of right chest, back of left shoulder, 
front of neck in middle, front of neck on left side and under the chin. His 
ribs 2nd to 7th on right side were fractured. Plora was perforated. Pleural 
cavity contained 3 liters of blood. Trachea was traumatized. Both right and 
left lungs were traumatized and perforated. Both atria were perforated. Aorta 
was perforated. According to the opinion of medical expert, all the injuries 
were ante-mortem, caused by fire arm. Cause of death was injuries to vital 
organs in chest. Probable duration between injuries and death was within 
few minutes, whereas, between death and post mortem examination, it was 
18 to 24 hours. 
 
Dr. Riasat Ali, (PW-16) conducted post mortem examination on the 
dead body of deceased Muhammad Yousaf on 29.06.2010 at 09:30 a.m. and 
observed injuries on his postro lateral right aspect of neck, left side of face 
and lateral side of right chest. All the injuries were anti-mortem, injuries 
No.1 & 2 were caused by fire arms, whereas, injuries No.3 & 4 were caused 
by blunt means. The cause of death in this case was damage to neck 
muscles, vessels, vertebra, (cervical) and T-4 & T-5 vertebra under injury 
No.2 leading to hemorrhage, paraplegia and sensory loss below T4 and T5, 
shock and death. Death was occurred in hospital and probable duration 
between death and post mortem was 17 hours and 20 hours.  
 
Dr. Mohsin Mukhtar held autopsy on the dead body of deceased 
Muhammad Saeed and Zulfiqar on 24.06.2010 at 09:30 a.m. & 10.30 a.m. 
respectively and issued their respective post mortem examination reports 
(Ex.PA & Ex.PB). He also conducted medico-legal examination of injured 
Muhammad Bashir and Muhammad Yasin on 23.06.2010 and issued their 
MLCs (Ex.PGGG & Ex.PHHH) respectively. Muhammad Iqbal, Record 
Keeper appeared as PW-21 & 31 and identified handwriting and signature of 
the doctor on the Post Mortem Examination Reports and Medico Legal 
Certificates.  
 
The locale, number and nature of injuries, weapons of offence used 
for causing these injuries and the duration between injuries and death as well 
as death and post mortem examination, was exactly in line with the ocular

account and as such, the medical evidence lends full support to the 
prosecution version. Though there was delay ranging from 17 to 24 hours in 
conducting post mortem examination on the dead bodies of the deceased yet 
to our mind the same is not fatal for more than one reasons. Firstly, in this 
unfortunate incident five persons lost their lives, two sustained injuries and 
only a female remained safe.  Muhammad Nawaz, SI (PW-26), who reached 
at the spot within 20/25 minutes after the occurrence stated that dead bodies 
of deceased Zulfiqar and Said were lying at the spot, whereas, rest of five 
injured persons had been shifted to the hospital and after fulfillment of codal 
formalities, he transmitted those two dead bodies to the mortuary without 
wastage of time. In this way, it can safely be concluded that the deceased, 
either in injured condition or dead, were shifted to the hospital soon after the 
occurrence and there was no deliberate delay in dispatching them to the 
mortuary/hospital and if afterwards the autopsy was held belatedly, the 
defence cannot claim its premium. Secondly, one of the deceased namely 
Muhammad Yousaf, while in injured condition was shifted to Mayo 
Hospital, Lahore where he remain admitted for five days and breathed his 
last on 28.06.2010, whereafter, his dead body was shifted to the KEMU for 
post mortem examination on the same day at 7.00 p.m. but even in that case, 
his autopsy was held with a delay of seventeen hours. We are unable to 
understand what kind of benefit the prosecution could achieve in delaying 
the post mortem examination of above deceased, as all the codal formalities 
including lodging of crime report, recording of statements of prosecution 
witnesses U/S 161 Cr.P.C. have already been completed. We can safely 
concluded that it was pattern of the hospital to conduct autopsy after a 
certain period either due to some administrative issue or non-availability of 
doctor, therefore, its benefit cannot be extended to the appellants. Reliance is 
placed on case reported as “Muhammad Asif ..Vs.. Mehboob Alam” (2020 
SCMR 837), wherein, delay for conducting the postmortem examination 
was twelve to twenty hours and  it has been laid down by the Apex Court 
that:- 
“In a country where the medical facility cum availability of paramedics for the job assigned 
is not easy task, the consumption of such a time seems to be quite reasonable, hence the 

M.R. No.189/2018 
Crl. Appeal Nos.204964, 204976, 204982, 204979, 204969, 
204974 , 204968 &204973 of 2018 
Crl. Revision No.213819/2018 
 
19 
 
 
prosecution evidence cannot be brush aside on this score alone to extent the benefit of doubt 
as claimed.” 
Similarly, in case reported as “Ghulam Rasool ..Vs.. The State” (2010 
SCMR 1579), it has been observed as under:- 
“the dead body was brought to the hospital at 9.45 a.m. and if for some reason may be 
administrative or due to lack of the Doctors/ staff, the post mortem was conducted later, it 
would not render the case of doubtful in nature, so as to ignore strong ocular evidence.” 
22. 
Learned defence counsels have laid much emphasis that the weapon 
of offence Kalashnikov (P-2), Kalashnikov (P-25) recovered at the instance 
of Afzaal alias Jalu and Muhammad Anwar respectively, did not match with 
the crime empties secured from the place of occurrence, whereas, nothing 
was recovered from the remaining death convicts/appellants, which fact 
alone is sufficient to take the same as a mitigating factor for awarding lessor 
punishment. As far as effect of inconsequential of weapon of offence shown 
to have been recovered at the instance of appellants Afzaal @ Jalu and 
Muhammad Anwar is concerned, we have observed that former was arrested 
after eighteen months, whereas, latter was after 36 months of the occurrence 
and in the intervening period, the weapons of offence used during the 
occurrence, are supposed to have not been preserved.  There is every 
possibility that he handed over different weapon of offence, with the 
intention to claim benefit of its being inconsequential at a subsequent stage 
and as such, it cannot be taken as a mitigating factor for awarding lessor 
punishment. Similarly, rest of death convicts also remained fugitive from 
law for a considerable period ranging from 09 months to 3-years, therefore, 
non-recovery of weapons of offence from them after such a long period is 
immaterial.  Even otherwise, it is well settled law that when the ocular 
account is found to be confidence inspiring and trustworthy, mere fact that 
recovery is inconsequential by itself could not be a ground for lessor 
punishment. Reliance is placed on case reported as “Nasir Ahmed ..Vs.. The 
State” (2023 SCMR 478). 
23. 
All the death convicts namely, Abdul Rehman, Muhammad Sarwar, 
Muhammad Anwar and Muhammad Afzaal @ Jalu remained fugitive from 
law for a considerable period of time.  No doubt absconsion is not a

conclusive proof of guilt of an accused but at the same time it cannot be 
overlooked when the evidence available on record suggests that the accused 
had deliberately and intentionally avoided to face the trial due to their guilty 
conscious.  In case reported as “Ch. Muhammad Yaqoob and others ..Vs.. 
The State and others” (1992 SCMR 1982), it has been laid down that:- 
“Furthermore, a distinction is to be drawn between a case in which an accused 
person immediately after the commission of the offence absconds and a case in 
which he absconds at the stage of arguments in the trial Court. The former being 
close proximity with the commission of the offence would carry more evidentiary 
value as compared to the latter.” 
24. 
For what has been discussed above, we have entertained no manner of 
doubt in our mind that the prosecution has successfully proved the charge 
against the appellants for committing deliberate and premediated murder of 
five innocent persons with common object and causing injuries to two others 
through cogent, reliable and confidence inspiring evidence. This unfortunate 
incident took place in a broad day light, the parties were already known to 
each other and in such situation, the question of miss-identification does not 
arise in any eventuality. The complainant has well explained her presence at 
the venue of occurrence, whereas, two other eye-witnesses being injured 
witnesses, also proved their presence at the spot through cogent and 
confidence inspiring evidence.  Motive as set out by the prosecution has 
successfully been proved.  The complainant lady would have been the last 
person to falsely implicate the appellants in case of murder of her four real 
brothers and one nephew in substitution of real culprits. Even otherwise, 
substitution is always considered to be a rare phenomenon in cases where 
the complainant lost his/her close kith and kin. The appellants have 
committed the murder of five persons of one family in a most gruesome and 
cold blooded manner. The persons responsible for committing such brutal, 
shocking, horrific and panic creating incident in the society deserve no 
leniency.  We have observed, that appellants Muhammad Imran, Shabbir 
Hussain and Naseer Ahmed to whom no specific role was attributed and 
general role of causing fire arm injuries to the deceased and injured persons, 
has already been awarded imprisonment for life by the trial Court because of 
mitigating circumstances.  However, learned defence counsels have failed to

bring on record any iota of circumstance, which may be taken as a 
mitigating circumstance for awarding lessor punishments to the death 
convicts to whom specific injuries at the deceased persons were not only 
attributed but also found existent. In case reported as ‘Muhammad Sharif 
..Vs.. The State’ (1991 SCMR 1622), it has been laid down as under:- 
“There can be no controversy that the normal penalty prescribed for the murder by the Divine 
Law as also the law of the land is death. A murderer is guilty of his actin before The Almighty 
Allah. He is regarded as the murderer of humanity. A Judge is required to do justice on each 
and every aspect strictly in accordance with law and should not mould the alternatives to 
favour the guilty. It is the Divine will that we must be firm and resolute to do justice whether 
it be detrimental to our own interests or the interest of those who are near and dear to us. 
Mercy is the attribute of God but we are warned not be allow that which is otherwise 
unlawful--- moreover, we should now show mercy to those who themselves are proved to 
have acted mercilessly.” 
Similarly, in Noor Muhammad .Vs. The State (1999 SCMR 2722), the Apex 
Court declined to reduce the sentence of the appellant as he committed the 
murder of two innocent girls in brutal and gruesome manner and observed 
that the people are losing faith in the Courts for the reason that they either 
acquit the accused persons on technical grounds or take a lenient view in 
awarding sentence. It was further observed that the Courts while deciding 
the question of guilt or innocence in murder and other heinous offences owe 
duty to the legal heirs/relations of the victim and also to the society and 
should award severer sentences to the act as a deterrent to the commission of 
offences.  
25. 
In view of what has been discussed above, all the appeals in hand 
being meritless, stand dismissed.
