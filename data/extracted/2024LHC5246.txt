Date of Hearing: 
04.11.2024 
Petitioner by: 
Mr. Atitq ur Rehman Kiani, Advocate.  
Respondents No.1 & 
2 by: 
Mr. Imran Shaukat Rao, Assistant 
Advocate General  
Respondents No. 3 to 
5 by: 
Mr. Waqar ul Haq Sheikh, Advocate 
with Kamran Khan, Chief Officer, 
District Council, Rawalpindi.   
 
Anwaar Hussain, J.  The petitioner, who was appointed, on 
contract, on the basis of Rule 17-A of the Civil Servants (Appointment 
and Conditions of Service) Rules, 1974 (omitted since 24.07.2024) was 
terminated with effect from 31.12.2017 through order dated 25.11.2017 
by serving one-month notice. The order dated 25.11.2017 reflects that 
the petitioner has been found guilty of misconduct and inefficiency 
during the inquiry conducted by the respondent-department, under the 
Punjab Employees Efficiency, Discipline and Accountability Act, 2006 
(“the Act”), as he remained absent from duty for three days from 
29.08.2017 to 31.08.2017. The petitioner challenged the said order by 
filing an appeal under the Act before Additional Commissioner 
(Revenue), Rawalpindi who through order dated 03.08.2020 (announced 
on 29.07.2020) re-instated the petitioner in service on the ground that the 
punishment awarded to the petitioner did not commensurate with his 
guilt and the intervening period was treated as leave without pay. Against 
order dated 03.08.2020, no formal revision was filed by the respondent-
department, however, a letter was written by the Administrator, Tehsil

Council, Rawalpindi to the Secretary Local Government and 
Community Development Department for guidance, who, vide order 
dated 14.09.2021 (“the impugned order”),  held that the order passed 
by the Additional Commissioner (Revenue), Rawalpindi is  not covered 
under the Contract Appointment Policy, 2004 (“the Policy”) as there is 
no provision in the Policy envisaging re-instatement of a contractual 
employee, after termination of his service. Hence, this constitutional 
petition.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the career of the 
petitioner has been stigmatized and after initiating the proceedings under 
the Act, the respondent-department took a somersault and, invoked the 
clauses of the Policy to terminate the services of the petitioner by issuing 
one-month notice, which was rightly challenged by the petitioner in 
appeal and order dated 03.08.2020 passed by the Appellate Authority is 
in accordance with law, which requires to be implemented as no formal 
revision was filed by the respondent-department against the said order. 
Further contends that this Court, in number of judgments, has 
categorially held that the appointment under Rule 17-A should be on 
regular basis and all employees appointed under the Policy should be 
regularized to which the petitioner was also entitled albeit for wrongful 
termination of his contract, said benefit could not be extended to the 
petitioner. Places reliance on the case reported as “Ali Ahmed v. EDEO, 
Silakot and another” (2014 PLC (CS) 793). 
3. 
Conversely, learned Law Officer, alongwith learned counsel for 
respondent-department, has supported the impugned order.  
4. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
5. 
Admittedly, the petitioner was appointed under the repealed  
Rule 17-A, on contract basis and was terminated from service after 
initiating an inquiry and stigmatizing his career. The petitioner was  

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.2763/2023 
 
     3 
inducted in service on 03.07.2014, which was extended for another three 
years period that was to expire on 03.07.2020 and in between the said 
contractual period, he was proceeded against on account of misconduct 
under the Act. Once the disciplinary proceedings were initiated, the 
respondent-department were estopped from taking a somersault and 
invoking the clauses pertaining to termination of contractual 
appointment by serving one- month notice, inasmuch as this Court in 
case of Ali Ahmed supra held that the appointments under Rule 17-A are 
to be made on regular basis from the outset and not on contractual basis. 
Similar view was taken in case reported as “Kashif Mehmood Zaman v. 
Chief Executive Officer, District Education Authority, Lahore and 3 
others” (2021 PLC(CS) Note 16). The legal position enunciated by this 
Court in case of Ali Ahmed supra has also been adopted as policy by the 
Government of the Punjab in terms of notification bearing No.SOR-
III(S&GAD)2-8/2018 dated 29.10.2019 (“the Notification”) wherein it 
has been mandated by the government itself that the appointments under 
Rule 17-A made after the year 2009, on contract basis, were unlawful 
and such contractual employees were to be regularized. In terms of 
Notification, the petitioner was to be appointed on regular basis since 
date of his induction, i.e., 03.07.2014 and hence, entitled to regular 
inquiry. The action of the respondent-department in first denying the 
regular appointment to the petitioner on the basis of Rule 17-A and then 
not proceeding further in terms of the Act violated due process rights of 
the petitioner. Hence, the Additional Commissioner (Revenue), 
Rawalpindi, rightly treated appointment of the petitioner as regular, by 
operation of the Notification whereas the Revisional Authority has taken 
jaundiced view of the matter by not appreciating this aspect of the matter 
while passing the impugned order. Therefore, the impugned order cannot 
sustain.  
6. 
For what has been discussed above, this writ petition is allowed 
and the impugned order is set aside with direction to the respondent-
