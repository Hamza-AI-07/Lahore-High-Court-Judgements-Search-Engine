           MUZAMIL AKHTAR SHABIR, J.   At the request of the learned 
counsel for the parties, this case is admitted for regular hearing. 
2. 
Learned counsel for petitioner states that appeal filed by the 
petitioner, Fareed-ud-Din, who was working as junior Key Punch Operator 
(‘K.P.O.’) in the University of Education, Vehari Campus, Vehari 
(‘University’) or (‘UE’), against major penalty of removal from service 
imposed against him under Section 4(b)(v) of the Punjab Employees 
Efficiency, Discipline and Accountability Act, 2006 (‘PEEDA’) or (‘Act’) 
by the Vice Chancellor of the University of Education, Lahore (‘Vice 
Chancellor’) vide order dated 17.01.2022 (‘Impugned Original Order’), 
has been dismissed by respondent No.3/Syndicate of the University of 
Education, Lahore (‘Syndicate’) vide order dated 18.07.2022 (‘Impugned 
Appellate Order’) passed on the basis of recommendations dated 
26.05.2022 (impugned recommendations) of the hearing officer appointed 
by the Syndicate by treating the appeal filed by the petitioner as 
misconceived and not maintainable solely for the reason that said appeal had 
been filed under wrong provision of law i.e. Section 33 of the University of 
Education, Lahore Ordinance, 2002 (‘Ordinance’), instead of correct 
provision of law i.e. Section 16 of PEEDA Act, 2006 (‘Act’), which 
observation recorded for dismissal of appeal was not sustainable in law for 

W.P. No.18847 of 2022 
 
-:2:-
the reason that such technicalities could not be allowed to defeat safe and 
proper Administration and dispensation of justice essential to reach ends of 
justice, which was the ultimate purpose of all procedures prescribed by law, 
therefore, impugned orders were liable to be set aside. 
3. 
Learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent-university while 
defending the impugned orders states that petitioner was proceeded against 
under the Act and major penalty of removal from service was also imposed 
against him by the Vice Chancellor of the University under the Act, whereas 
instead of filing appeal through proper procedure provided under Section 16 
of the Act the  petitioner had filed appeal under wrong provision of law i.e. 
under Section 33 of the Ordinance which was dismissed by the Syndicate as 
not maintainable and against the dismissal of said appeal, the petitioner had 
also approached Chancellor of University (‘Chancellor’) by filing appeal 
under Section 16 of the Act for challenging the impugned original and 
appellate orders, which had also been dismissed as not maintainable by the 
Chancellor on 27.10.2022 (‘order of the Chancellor’), therefore, this 
petition challenging the aforementioned impugned orders, wherein findings 
of fact recorded against the petitioner of his being found guilty of corruption 
in the Punjab Educational Endowment Fund PEEF/Ehsaas Scholarships 
cannot be challenged through the instant Constitution petition, which is also 
not maintainable. 
4. 
The perusal of the record shows that the petitioner was appointed as 
Junior Key Punch Operator (‘Jr. KPO’) in BS-07 on 16.02.2015 at 
University of Education Vehari campus. Aqib Javed, a student of BS 
Chemistry, UE, Vehari Campus filed application before the Principal UE, 
Vehari Campus that he had received a telephonic call from PEEF Head 
Office regarding verification of receipt of PEEF scholarship for Rs. 72,000/- 
received by him, on which he had informed that he had not received any 
amount. The Principal, University of Education issued explanation letter on 
30.09.2021 to the petitioner to whom duties for disbursement of scholarships 
had been assigned to explain the disbursement of PEEF Scholarship to Aqib 
Javaid and provide evidence within 03 working days to which he did not 
give any explanation. On 06.10.2021, the Principal University of Education 

W.P. No.18847 of 2022 
 
-:3:-
constituted an Inquiry Committee comprising of 04 members to inquire the 
matter of PEEF scholarship against the application of Aqib Javed with a 
direction to submit report till 08.10.2021. The inquiry committee on 
15.10.2021 submitted its report and declared the petitioner guilty and 
recommended action against him under rules and regulations. The 
Competent Authority appointed Dr. Muhammad Tahir, Associate Professor 
of Physics, UE, Vehari Campus as an inquiry Officer vide notification dated 
01.11.2021 to proceed against the petitioner under Section 9(1)(a) of the 
PEEDA Act 2006 to conduct the inquiry. The inquiry officer found the 
petitioner to be guilty of charge of corruption in PEEF/Ehsaas Scholarships 
and submitted his recommendations on 24.12.2021 and recommended to 
impose the penalty to withhold increments for a period of one year under 
Section 4(1)(a)(ii) of the Act. The Vice Chancellor of the respondent 
university after further process in the matter while disagreeing with the 
recommendations of the Inquiry Officer, vide order dated 17.01.2022 passed 
in exercise of powers of Competent Authority vested in him under Section 
13(4)(b) of the Act, imposed major penalty of removal from service under 
Section 4(b)(v) of PEEDA Act, 2006 upon the petitioner, as charges against 
him stood proved. The operative part of the order of Vice Chancellor is 
reproduced below: 
 
“Therefore, I, Prof. Dr. Talat Naseer Pasha, S.I., Vice Chancellor, 
University of Education Lahore, as a competent authority, for the reasons 
given, disagree with the recommendations of the inquiry Officer and 
impose Major Penalty of Removal from Service upon Mr. Farid ud Din 
Ahmad, Junior KPO, University of Education, Vehari Campus Vehari in 
terms of Section 4(b)(v) of PEEDA ACT, 2006.” 
 
5. 
On 25.01.2022 office order was issued notifying that the petitioner 
stands removed from service w.e.f. 17.01.2022 (i.e. the date of order passed 
by the Competent Authority). 
6. 
The petitioner on 01.02.2022 filed appeal before the syndicate against 
the said order under Section 33 of University of Education Lahore, 
Ordinance, 2002 and vide order dated 28.04.2022 Prof. Dr. Muhammad 
Alam Saeed, Director, Division of Science & Technology/Member 
Syndicate was appointed by the Syndicate as the hearing officer to provide 
personal hearing on behalf of Syndicate. The hearing officer vide his order 

W.P. No.18847 of 2022 
 
-:4:-
dated 26.05.2022 (‘Impugned Recommendations’), while relying upon 
Section 16 of the PEEDA Act, 2006 recommended for dismissal of the 
appeal by observing as under: 
 
“The appellant instead of filing an appeal under the provisions of 
PEEDA Act, 2006 has filed the instant appeal before the Syndicate under 
Section 33 of University of Education, Lahore Ordinance, 2002. 
The appeal was placed before the Syndicate in its meeting held on 
24.03.2002 the Syndicate appointed the undersigned as hearing officer to 
accord a personal hearing to the appellant. 
……… 
……… 
It is manifestly clear from the above that order of the departmental 
authority in respect of any of the terms and conditions of service of a 
university employee can only be challenged by way of an appeal under the 
provisions of PEEDA Act, 2006. 
It is added that the order dated 17.01.2022 was not appealable in terms of 
Section 33 of the University of Education, Lahore Ordinance, 2002. 
For the foregoing reasons, the instant petition is misconceived and not 
maintainable consequently the same is hereby dismissed.” 
 
7. 
On the basis of the afore-referred recommendations of the hearing 
officer, notification bearing No.UE/Syn/DD-Mgt/2022/92 dated July 18, 
2022 (‘impugned Appellate Order’) was issued on behalf of Syndicate 
dismissing the petitioner’s appeal in the following terms: 
 
“The Syndicate in its 67th meeting held on 04.07.2022, approved 
the recommendation made by the Hearing Officer, hence the instant 
petition of Mr. Farid ud Din Ahmad s/o Mumtaz Ahmad, Ex-Junior KPO 
(BS-07) was misconceived and not maintainable, consequently the same is 
hereby dismissed.” 
 
8. 
The petitioner there-after filed departmental appeal against the afore-
referred orders under Section 16 of PEEDA Act, 2006 addressed to the 
Governor of the Punjab in his capacity as Chancellor of University of 
Education, Lahore which was dismissed as not maintainable vide order dated 
27.10.2022 (‘order of Chancellor’), in the following terms: 
 
“Subject: DEPARTMENTAL APPEAL UNDER SECTION 16 
OF PEEDA ACT, 2006 AGAINST THE ORDER DATED 25.01.2022 
WHEREBY THE PENALTY OF REMOVAL FROM SERVICE WAS 
IMPOSED UPON THE APPELLANT WITHOUT ANY LEGAL AND 
LAWFUL JUSTIFICATION. 
Kindly refer to your appeal dated 26.08.2022, on the subject. 
2. 
I have been directed to inform you that the Hon’ble 
Governor/Chancellor has been pleased to dispose of your appeal being 
not maintainable before him under Punjab Employees Efficiency, 
Discipline & Accountability Act, 2006. The Appellate Authority/Syndicate, 
in terms of Section 16 of the Act ibid, has already dismissed your appeal. 
Therefore, your appeal before the Hon’ble Governor/Chancellor is not 

W.P. No.18847 of 2022 
 
-:5:-
maintainable, as there is no provision of 2nd appeal in the Punjab 
Employees Efficiency, Discipline & Accountability Act, 2006.” 
 
9. 
The petitioner has challenged all the afore-mentioned orders through 
this Constitution petition by making the following prayer:- 
 
“In view of above submissions, it is respectfully prayed that this 
petition may kindly be accepted, the impugned order passed by respondent 
No. 3 may kindly be declared as illegal, unlawful, colorful exercise of 
power, result of mala fide, violation of principle of natural justice and the 
same may kindly be set aside and respondent No. 3 may kindly be directed 
to attend the departmental appeal of the petitioner on merit and decide the 
fate of the same while affording an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner 
in the larger interest of justice. 
Any other relief which this Hon’ble Court deems fit and necessary may 
also be awarded to the petitioner.” 
 
10. 
The learned counsel for the respondent university has argued that 
constitutional jurisdiction cannot by exercised to set aside concurrent 
findings of fact recorded by the forums below. Ordinarily such legal position 
may be correct in most of the cases, however it is not an absolute rule of law 
and is subject to certain exceptions. For example, concurrent findings of fact 
can be set aside inter alia on the ground where it can be shown that the 
finding is on the face of it against the evidence or so patently improbable, or 
perverse that to accept it could amount to perpetuating a grave miscarriage 
of justice, or if there has been any misapplication of principles relating to 
appreciation of evidence, or is against some provision of law or finally, if the 
finding can be demonstrated to be physically impossible or not sustainable at 
all. For reaching the said conclusion reliance, inter alia, has been placed on 
the principles laid down by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in judgment 
reported as Sardar Ali Khan versus State Bank of Pakistan and others (2022 
SCMR 1454).  
11. 
Be that as it may, another aspect of the matter is that this constitution 
petition can be decided without deeply going into the merits of the case 
relating to the findings of fact recorded by the forums below as the same can 
be decided on the basis of legal issue about the validity of decision relating 
to maintainability of appeal before the Syndicate, hence, without 
commenting upon the allegations of corruption raised and finding of guilt 
recorded against the petitioner through the inquiry report relied upon in the 

W.P. No.18847 of 2022 
 
-:6:-
impugned original order of Vice Chancellor, lest it may prejudice case of 
either party, it is observed that the Syndicate on the recommendation of the 
hearing officer dismissed the appeal filed by the petitioner as misconceived 
and not maintainable because the same had been filed under wrong provision 
of law, whereas the Chancellor dismissed the petitioner’s appeal as 2nd 
appeal was not maintainable under PEEDA by treating the appeal filed 
before the syndicate as 1st appeal under PEEDA. It is important to observe at 
this stage that this matter can be decided without disturbing the findings of 
non-maintainability of 2nd Appeal under the PEEDA Act recorded by the 
Chancellor in his order as deciding the said aspect of the matter either way 
i.e. in the affirmative or in the negative would not have any effect on the 
result of the case, hence the said aspect of the matter has not been dilated 
upon in detail. 
12. 
Although, learned counsel for the respondent-university has 
vehemently defended the impugned orders, it is noticed that the appeal filed 
by the petitioner was dismissed by the Syndicate on technical grounds of 
having been filed under wrong provision of law i.e. under the Ordinance, 
whereas it has not been contested or denied that remedy of appeal was 
available to the petitioner before the same forum under the Act. Where 
remedy of appeal is available before the same forum under any other law or 
provision of law instead of the law cited in the title of the appeal, the same 
could not be dismissed for the reason that incorrect law or provision of law 
had been referred to in the title of the appeal and any such reasoning given 
for dismissal of appeal as misconceived and not maintainable would not be 
based on correct interpretation of law for the reason that wrong mentioned  
of law or a provision of law would not be an illegality but a curable defect in 
view of principles laid down by the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan 
in cases titled “Olas Khan and others versus Chairman NAB through 
Chairman and others” (PLD 2018 SC 40) and “MARGRETE WILLIAM 
versus ABDUL HAMID MIAN” (1994 SCMR 1555), wherein it is settled 
that mere mentioning of wrong provision of law could not be treated as an 
impediment in the way of filing or maintainability of an appeal, especially 
where remedy was available before the same authority or forum under some 

W.P. No.18847 of 2022 
 
-:7:-
other provision of law and one type of proceedings could be converted to 
another type of proceedings by correction of mis-description of title of 
proceedings. Besides the right of appeal although procedural in nature is not 
merely a matter of procedure but a substantive right which once it has 
accrued according to law cannot be taken away unless the exercise of such 
right is barred under some provision of law as settled by the principles laid 
down by the Honourable Supreme Court in cases titled “Manzoor Ali and 39 
others versus United Bank Limited through President” (2005 SCMR 1785) 
and “Mst. Shohrat Bano versus Ismail, Dada Adam Soomar” (1968 SCMR 
574).  
13. 
There is another aspect of the matter that unless curtailed by law, an 
appeal is the continuation of original proceedings, wherein the entire case is 
reopen for consideration before the Appellate forum and the appellate forum 
while deciding the appeal has the same powers available with it as were 
vested in the original forum in view of the principles laid down in the 
judgments of the Honourable Supreme Court in judgments reported as 
“Khudadad versus Syed Ghazanfar Ali Shah alias S. Inaam Hussain and 
others” (2022 SCMR 933), “Mushtaq Ul Aarifin and others versus Mumtaz 
Muhammad and others” (2022 SCMR 55), “Ch. Iftikhar Ahmed, I.-G., 
Islamabad and others versus The State” (2018 SCMR 1385) and “Multan 
Electric Power Company Ltd. through Chief Executive and another versus 
Muhammad Ashiq and others” (PLD 2006 SC 328). Reference may also be 
made to case titled “Ghulam Qadir and others versus Sh. Abdul Wadood and 
others” (PLD 2016 SC 712), wherein it is provided that:-   
 
“An appeal is not merely a matter of procedure but a substantive 
right. It is the continuation of a suit and during appellate proceedings the 
entire matter stands reopened. The jurisdiction of an appellate court can 
be invoked by a person who believes that the subordinate court has erred 
in law or in fact whilst passing the judgment/order under appeal.” 
 
14. 
Moreover, it is a settled law that principal object behind all legal 
formalities was to safeguard paramount interest of justice and proceedings 
should be held in order to do substantial justice and to avoid technicalities 
unless the same are insurmountable in view of some impediment placed on 
exercise of jurisdiction by law or is necessary on grounds of public policy as 

W.P. No.18847 of 2022 
 
-:8:-
all procedures are meant for advancement of justice and to avoid injustice to 
the parties and mere technicalities unless offering an insurmountable hurdle 
should not be allowed to defeat the ends of justice. Reliance may be placed 
on judgments reported as “Mst. Bundi Begum versus Munshi Khan and 
others” (PLD 2004 SC 154), “United Bank Limited versus Pakistan 
Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation Ltd. and another” (PLD 2002 
SC 1100), “Jameel Ahmed versus Late Saifuddin through Legal 
Representatives” (1997 SCMR 260).   
15. 
Reliance in this regards may also be placed on the principles laid 
down in “Manager, Jammu & Kashmir, State Property in Pakistan versus 
Khuda Yar and another” (PLD 1975 SC 678) wherein it is provided as 
under:- 
 
“The proposition could hardly be disputed that the principal object 
behind all legal formalities is to safeguard the paramount interest of 
justice. In fact while considering the importance of legal technicalities and 
rules of procedure in the administration of justice, it is inevitable to recall 
the various evolutionary stages in the transition from justice without law 
of primitive society to justice in accordance with law of modern society 
and the conflict between equity and law in judicial history. It cannot be 
denied that legal precepts were devised with a view to impart certainty, 
consistency and uniformity to administration of justice and to secure it 
against arbitrariness, errors of individual judgment and mala fide. Over a 
period of time this development of codes and rules led to the evolution of 
what is called “jurisprudence of Conception” a system of logical 
deduction from fixed premises. In order to avoid the rigidity and hardship 
of ultra formalism recourse is had to principle of equitable application 
and interpretation of legal precepts and conferment of judicial discretion 
on the Courts as envisaged by Order XLI, rule 33 of the C. P. C. in regard 
to Constitutional power of this Court to do complete justice in all matters. 
These two provisions read together lead to the irreparable conclusion that 
mere technicalities unless offering an insurmountable hurdle should not 
be allowed to defeat the ends of justice. It was observed by Kaikaus, J. in 
Imtiaz Ahmad v. Ghulam Ali (P L D 1963 S C 382) as follows:‑‑  
“I must confess that having dealt with technicalities for more than 
forty years, out of which thirty years are at the Bar, I do not feel 
much impressed with them. I think the proper place of procedure in 
any system of administration of justice is to help and not to thwart 
the grant to the people of their rights. All technicalities have to be 
avoided unless it be essential to comply with them on ground of 
public policy. The English system of administration of justice on 
which our own is based may be to a certain extent technical but we 
are not to take from that system its defect. Any system which by 
giving effect to the form and not to the substance defeats 
substantive rights, is defective to that extent. The ideal must always 
be a system that gives to every person what is his.” 
 

W.P. No.18847 of 2022 
 
-:9:-
16. 
Principles laid down in case titled “Muhammad Bashir and another 
versus Province of Punjab through Collector of District Gujrat and others” 
(2003 SCMR 83) are also relevant for the said legal position, wherein it is 
provided as under:- 
 
“Technicalities of law are always avoided and discouraged in 
order to do complete justice and to ensure that justice is not only done but 
also seen to have been done. Rules of procedure are enacted for fostering 
the ends of justice and preserving the rights rather than to stifle the 
dispensation of justice and, unless they are unsurmountable, ends of 
justice always outweigh the manner of practice and procedure.” 
 
17. 
It is settled law that purpose behind legal and codal formalities and 
technicalities of procedure was nothing but only to ensure the safe 
administration of justice and avoid the chances of injustice/miscarriage of 
justice. Reliance for which is placed upon judgment reported as “Imtiaz 
Ahmad Vs. Ghulam Ali and others” (PLD 1963 SC 382), “Munawar Ali and 
others Vs. Umar Daraz and others” (2022 CLC 920) (Sindh) and “Aamir 
Hameed and another Vs. Messrs Alloo and Manocher Dinshaw Charitable 
Trust through one of the four trustees and 14 others” (2019 YLR 1055) 
(Sindh). Moreover, proper place of procedure in any system of 
administration of justice is to help and not to thwart the grant to the people 
of their rights. Reliance is placed upon “Marriam Bibi and others versus 
Azhar Iqbal and others” (PLD 2022 Lah 840) and “Nadeem Zuberi versus 
Civil Aviation Authority through Director General” (PLD 2021 Sindh 103). 
As a necessary corollary ideal system was one that gave to every person 
what was theirs’. Reliance may be placed on principles laid down in 
judgments reported as “Allah Ditta versus Barkat Ali and 3 others” (1992 
SCMR 1974), “Nadeem Zuberi versus Civil Aviation Authority through 
Director General” (PLD 2021 Sindh 103) and “Imtiaz Ahmad versus 
Ghulam Ali and others” (PLD 1963 SC 382), the operative part Imtiaz 
Ahmad’s case is reproduced below:- 
 
“...the proper place of procedure in any system of administration 
of justice is to help and not to thwart the grant to the people of their 
rights. All technicalities have to be avoided unless it be essential to 
comply with them on grounds of public policy. Any system which by giving 
effect to the form and not to the substance defeats substantive rights is 
defective to that extent. The ideal must always be a system that gives to 
every person what is his." 
 

W.P. No.18847 of 2022 
 
-:10:-
18. 
It is pertinent to mention here that in the instant case as the original 
proceedings had arisen out of the PEEDA Act, hence, the hearing officer and 
the Syndicate should have taken up the appeal for hearing by treating the 
same to be an appeal filed under the PEEDA Act, instead of appeal under the 
Ordinance and should not have dismissed the same on a technical ground by 
declaring the same as misconceived and not maintainable for the reason of 
having been filed under wrong provision of law, therefore, in the interest of 
justice impugned order passed by the Syndicate dated 18.07.2022 which is 
based on recommendation of the hearing officer dated 26.05.2022 is 
declared to have been passed without any lawful authority and of no legal 
effect and is set aside with the result that the appeal of the petitioner shall be 
deemed to be pending and the same shall be placed before Syndicate in its 
next meeting for further proceedings by treating the same as an appeal under 
Section 16 of PEEDA Act 2006, which shall be decided on its own merit in 
accordance with law. 
19. 
With this observation, this constitutional petition stands disposed of.
