       Through this petition under Article 199 
of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973 the petitioner Arshad Abbas seeks quashing of 
impugned FIR No.13/2024, in respect of offence 
under Sections 409, 420, 468 & 471,477-A PPC 
read with Section 5(2) of Prevention of Corruption 
Act, 1947 (PCA), registered at P.S. Anti Corruption 
Circle, Sargodha.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits 
that respondent No.2 (complainant) in connivance 
with respondent No.1 got lodged the impugned FIR 
with malafide intentions and ulterior motives; that 
allegation against the petitioner in the impugned 
FIR was that he while serving as Halqa Patwari, in 
order to extend undue favour to respondents No. 5 
to 7 (co-accused), in connivance with Munshi, 
Girdawar and Naib Tehsildar, prepared a forged and 
fictitious Tatima in a joint Khata, for which he was 

W.P. No.53631-Q/2024 
 
 
 
                        2 
 
 
not legally authorized; that according to Paragraph 
No.7.8 of Chapter No.7 of the Land Record 
Manuals, if a co-sharer is in possession of land in 
joint Khata, a Tatima can be carved out, even 
without any partition proceedings; that co-accused 
were in possession of the land, as such by preparing 
Tatima, the petitioner has not committed any kind of 
crime; that neither the petitioner prepared any 
forged and fictitious document, nor there was any 
allegation 
against 
him 
for 
receiving 
illegal 
gratification, as such the offences levelled in the 
impugned crime report are not made out; that the 
matter between private parties was purely of civil 
nature; that the complainant also filed an appeal U/S 
161 of the Land Revenue Act, 1967 before the 
Assistant Commissioner/ Collector, Sub-Division, 
District Sargodha regarding disputed Tatima which 
is pending adjudication, as such regarding same 
subject matter, launching of criminal proceedings is 
not permissible under the law; that first Inquiry 
Officer recommended to file the complaint of the 
complainant but second Inquiry Officer in active 
connivance with the complainant, recommended 
registration of impugned FIR; that there is no 
likelihood of conviction of the petitioner, as such 
the impugned FIR is liable to be quashed.  
3. 
On the contrary, learned counsel for the 
complainant submits that the petitioner, while 
serving as Halqa Patwari, in order to deprive the 
complainant from his valuable land, incorporated 
his land into the land of co-accused through 
Tatima in a joint Khata, for which he was not 
legally authorized; that co-accused on the basis of 
said Tatima took over the possession of the land of 
the complainant; that the petitioner has committed 

W.P. No.53631-Q/2024 
 
 
 
                        3 
 
 
a cognizable offence, as such impugned FIR was 
rightly lodged in accordance with the relevant 
provisions of law.  
4. 
Learned Law Officer submits that the 
petitioner is named in the crime report with a 
specific role; that investigation is under progress; 
that 
quashing 
of 
FIR 
during 
process 
of 
investigation amounts to hamper and jeopardize 
the entire investigation process prior to its 
finalization; that this Court in exercise of its 
Constitutional jurisdiction cannot assume the role 
of Investigating Officer; that the petitioner may be 
directed to raise all these grounds before the 
Investigating Officer.  
5. 
Learned counsels for co-accused, however, 
supported the submissions of the learned counsel 
for the petitioner while elaborating that impugned 
FIR is a result of concocted facts; that infact co-
accused Khawar Hayat, got lodged FIR No.462/18, 
in respect of offence U/S 427, 506, 147 & 149 
PPC, P.S. Satellite Town, Sargodha against the    
father of the complainant, in which co-accused 
Farooq Hayat was the eye-witness; that due to that 
very reason the complainant got lodged the 
impugned FIR, which is liable to be quashed.  
6. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
7. 
By way of this petition the petitioner has 
invoked extraordinary Constitutional jurisdiction 
of this Court for quashing of aforementioned 
impugned FIR. Ordinarily, time and again this 
Court has shown reluctance in interfering in the 
ongoing investigating process on the well 
cherished 
principle 
that 
the 
functions 
of 
Investigating 
Agency 
and 
judiciary 
are 
complementary and not overlapping and the 

W.P. No.53631-Q/2024 
 
 
 
                        4 
 
 
combination of individual liberty with  due 
observance of law and order can only be achieved 
if both the organs are allowed to function 
independently. However, this principle in any way 
cannot be construed an absolute bar on the power 
of this Court in quashing of FIR in cases where the 
Court is satisfied that investigation is launched 
with malafide intention and without jurisdiction. 
Reliance is placed on case reported as “Shahnaz 
Begum ..Vs.. Hon’ble Judge of the High Court of 
Sindh and Balochistan” (PLD 1971 SC 677), 
wherein it has been laid down as under:- 
“If an investigation is launched mala fide or 
is 
clearly 
beyond 
the 
jurisdiction 
of 
the 
investigating agencies concerned then it may be 
possible for the action of the Investigating Agencies 
to be corrected by proper proceedings either under 
Article 98 of the Constitution of 1962 or under the 
provisions of section 491 of the Criminal Procedure 
Code, if the applicant is in the latter case in 
detention, but not by invoking the inherent power 
under section 561-A of the Criminal Procedure 
Code.” 
Similarly, in case reported as “Anwar 
Ahmad Khan ..Vs.. The State (1996 SCMR 24)”, it 
has been laid down as under:- 
“ It is well settled principle that where 
investigation is malfide or without jurisdiction, the 
High Court in exercise of its Constitutional 
jurisdiction under Article 199 is competent to 
correct such proceedings and pass necessary order 
to ensure justice and fair play. The Investigating 
Authorities do not have the entire and total authority 
of running investigation according to their whims”.  
In case reported as Raja Rustam Ali Khan 
..Vs.. Muhammad Hanif (1997 SCMR 2008), it has 
been observed as under:- 

W.P. No.53631-Q/2024 
 
 
 
                        5 
 
 
“It would, therefore, be seen that if an 
investigation 
is 
launched 
malafide 
by 
the 
Investigating Agencies, the same is open to 
correction 
by 
invoking 
the 
constitutional 
jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 199 of 
the Constitution.” 
In case reported as “Muhammad Irshad 
Khan ..Vs..  Chairman, National Accountability 
Bureau and 2 others (2007 P Cr. LJ) 1957 the 
learned   Division Bench of Sindh High Court, 
observed as under:- 
“ Thus the consensus of the Honourable 
Supreme Court of Pakistan from the year 1971 and 
onward is that High Court  has jurisdiction under 
Article 199 of the Constitution and competent to 
correct such proceedings and pass necessary orders 
to ensure justice and fairplay. The Investigating 
Authorities do not have the entire and total authority 
of running investigation according to their whims, 
therefore, if the investigation is launched malafidely 
or beyond the jurisdiction of investigating agency, 
then the same can be corrected and appropriate 
orders can be passed.” 
The question what is “ malafide” has been 
answered by the Apex Court in case reported as 
“The Federation of Pakistan through Secretary 
Establishment Division, Government of Pakistan, 
Rawalpindi .V.. Saeed Ahmad Khan (PLD 1974 SC 
151) in the following way:- 
“ Mala fides” literally means “in bad faith”. 
Action taken in bad faith is usually taken 
maliciously in fact, that is to say, in which the 
person taking the action does so out of personal 
motives either to hurt the person against whom the 
action is taken or to benefit oneself. Action taken in 
colourable exercise of powers, that is to say, for 
collateral purposes not authorized by the law under 
which the action is taken or action taken in fraud of 

W.P. No.53631-Q/2024 
 
 
 
                        6 
 
 
the law are also malafide. It is necessary, therefore, 
for a person alleging that an action has been taken 
mala fide to show that the person responsible for 
taking the action has been motivated by any one of 
the considerations mentioned above.” 
Recently, in case reported as “F.I.A. through 
Director General, FIA and others .Vs. Syed Hamid 
Ali Shah and others (PLD 2023 SC 265)”, the 
Apex Court has observed as under:- 
“Article 199 (1)(a)(ii) of the Constitution 
empowers the High Courts to judicially review the 
acts done or proceedings taken by the persons 
performing functions in connection with the affairs 
of the Federation, a Province or a local authority 
and if find such acts or proceedings to have been 
done or taken without lawful authority, to declare 
them to be so and of no legal effect. The registration 
of an FIR and the doing of an investigation are the 
acts of officials of the police department ( a 
provincial law enforcement agency) who perform 
functions in connection with the affairs of a 
Province and are thus amenable to the jurisdiction 
of the High Court under Article 199 (1)(a)(ii) of the 
Constitution. The High Courts can declare such acts 
of the police officers, to have been made without 
lawful authority and of no legal effect if they are 
found to be so and can also make appropriate 
incidental or consequential order to effectuate its 
decision, such as quashing the FIR and investigation 
proceedings.” 
8. 
On the touchstone of above criteria, I have 
to determine the fate of instant case. Gist of the 
allegations against the petitioner contained in the 
crime report is that he while serving as Halqa 
Patwari prepared a Tatima Shajra in a joint Khewit 
in favour of co-accused, for which he was not 
legally authorized/competent. Main emphasis of 
the learned counsel for the complainant was that 

W.P. No.53631-Q/2024 
 
 
 
                        7 
 
 
no Tatima can be carved out in favour of a co-
sharer in a joint Khata. In order to determine legal 
basis of this submission, I have gone through Land 
Record Manuals, para No.4.23 of said Manual 
envisaged the procedure for preparation of Tatima 
Shajras on permanent basis, relevant portion of 
said para which deals regarding transactions based 
on registered deed is reproduced for ready 
reference:- 
“In the case of a transaction based on a 
registered 
deed 
the 
revenue 
officer 
should 
immediately on receipt of the registration of 
memorandum 
from 
the 
Registration 
Office 
(paragraph 7.23), direct the Kanungo and the 
Patwari to proceed to the spot and prepare a tatima 
shajra, if one is necessary, on the basis of material 
given in the registration memorandum and that 
alone. On the completion of the tatima shajra it shall 
be submitted by the Kanungo to the revenue 
officer.” 
  It is thus manifestly clear that in cases 
where the transaction was based on registered 
deed, it was incumbent upon the Revenue Officer 
to ensure that Kanungo and Patwari must visit the 
spot and prepare Tatima shajra, if necessary, on 
the basis of material given in the registration 
memorandum alone. No prohibition was shown 
that in case of joint Khata Tatima could not be 
carved out. Similarly, to deal with the eligibility of 
the petitioner for carving out Tatima Shajra 
paragraph No.7.8 of Chapter 7 of said Manual is of 
pivotal importance, which reads as under:- 
“Transfer of portion of field: If the part or 
a share of a field has been transferred and separate 
possession has been taken, draw on the back of the 
mutation sheet and its counterfoil a map of the 

W.P. No.53631-Q/2024 
 
 
 
                        8 
 
 
whole field and show as a sub-number the part 
transferred. No partition proceedings are necessary. 
The field Kanungo must attest the correctness of the 
map after personal examination of the field on the 
spot and satisfy himself as to the fact of possession. 
He must also see that the field as drawn on the back 
of mutation sheet is an exact copy of the field as 
shown in the shajra Kishtwar. Further details in 
regard to the preparation, check and use of these 
maps on the mutation sheets are given in chapter 4 
of the manual. The attesting officer must defer the 
passing of an order sanctioning a mutation if he 
finds that these instructions have not been carried 
out exactly.”  
Moreso, Board of Revenue, Punjab vide 
letter No.4149-2009/1565-LR(II) dated 12.12.2009 
has issued instructions to all the concerned 
including patwaries to follow the provisions of 
Land 
Record 
Manuals, 
reproduced 
supra, 
regarding preparation of Tatima Shajra, in case the 
transaction is based on registered deed, after 
personally verifying the possession of the party. 
Here in the instant case, transactions in favour of 
co-accused were made through registered deeds 
and the revenue authorities including the petitioner 
after verifying their possession on the spot carved 
out Tatima Shajra and this fact was confirmed by 
the successor of the petitioner by appearing before 
the First Inquiry Officer that at the time of carving 
out Tatima co-accused were in possession over the 
said land, otherwise, it would never happen. First 
Inquiry 
Officer 
gave 
sound 
reasons 
for 
recommending filed of the complaint of the 
complainant. 
Second 
Inquiry 
Officer, 
who 
observed that the act of the petitioner and other 
revenue officials for carving out Tatima Shajra  in 
a joint khata without partition, calls for action 

W.P. No.53631-Q/2024 
 
 
 
                        9 
 
 
against them, appears to be unaware of the  
relevant guidelines incorporated in the Land 
Record Manuals for preparation of Shajra Tatima.  
9. 
Another important factor which needs 
consideration is that according to the contents of 
impugned crime report, the complainant came to 
know that the co-accused pursuant to disputed 
Tatima Shajra took over the possession of his land 
in the early days of year 2023 but he for the first 
time moved application for registration of case 
against the accused persons on 05.12.2023 i.e. with 
an unexplained and inordinate delay of eleven 
months. Had the complainant was dispossessed 
from the land as alleged in the impugned crime 
report, he would knock the door of relevant 
authorities at the first instance. Silence of the 
complainant for such a considerable period of time 
leads me to an irresistible conclusion that the story 
alleged in the crime report was concocted by him 
subsequently just to entangle the accused in 
criminal litigation.  
10. 
Last but not the least, controversial question 
as to whether Tatima Shajra  can be carved out in 
a joint khata without partition, is a controversial 
question, which can only be determined by the 
Civil / Revenue Courts and the record is indicative 
of the fact that the complainant has already availed 
such remedy by way of filing appeal U/S 161 of 
Land 
Revenue 
Act 
before 
the 
Assistant 
Commissioner/ Collector and the matter is still 
subjudice at the said forum. Neither in the crime 
report the complainant raised any allegation that 
the petitioner prepared Tatima after receiving 
illegal gratification from the co-accused nor during 
the course of investigation, Investigating Agency 

W.P. No.53631-Q/2024 
 
 
 
                        10 
 
 
collected any incriminating material in this regard. 
In such an eventuality, even if for the sake of 
arguments, it is presumed that the petitioner was 
not authorized in carving out Tatima in a joint 
Khata without partition, even then in the absence 
of any allegation of receiving bribe in doing so, at 
the most it can be considered as an irregularity on 
his behalf while performing his official duty and 
he can be proceeded departmentally but in no 
manner, act of the petitioner constituted any 
criminal 
offence, 
as 
such 
Anti-Corruption 
Authority has any role to investigate the same. 
Reliance is placed on case reported as “Rashid 
Mirza ..Vs.. Regional Director and 2 others (2009 
MLD 25)”, wherein it has been laid down as 
under:-   
“The Anti-Corruption Establishment have 
very limited and special functions, and powers. The 
only object of the creation of this special criminal 
investigating agency was to combat corruption, 
bribery and embezzlement of public money and, 
therefore, the main focus of the Anti-Corruption 
Establishment should have been eradication of 
corruption. In the recent past, I have noted with 
concern that Agency has been encroaching upon the 
functions 
and 
powers 
of other 
government 
departments. It has also been noted in a number of 
cases that irregularities committed by government 
functionaries were treated as offences by the 
Agency. In the circumstances it has become 
essential 
to 
direct 
the 
Anti-Corruption 
Establishment not to go beyond, their mandate.” 
11. 
It is worthwhile to mention here that earlier 
co-accused Malik Khawar Hayat got lodged FIR 
No.462/18 dated 26.09.2018, in respect of offence 
U/S 427,506,147 & 149 PPC, at P.S. Satellite 
Town, Sargodha against the father of the 

W.P. No.53631-Q/2024 
 
 
 
                        11 
 
 
complainant, as such possibility cannot be ruled 
out that the complainant in order to settle score 
with the co-accused prompted to lodge the 
impugned crime report with fabricated facts.  
12. 
Learned counsel for the complainant was 
asked time and again, how from the contents of 
crime report the offence levelled in it is made out, 
but he could not answer satisfactorily. Apparently, 
the complainant has got lodged impugned FIR for 
achieving some mysterious objectives and keeping 
in view above facts and circumstances of the case, 
I am of the firm view that allowing the 
investigating agency to investigate the case would 
amount to abuse of process of law.  
13. 
In view of above, instant writ petition is 
allowed as a consequence thereof impugned FIR 
No.13/24, in respect of offence under Sections 
409, 420, 468,471 & 477-A PPC read with Section 
5(2) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 
registered at P.S. Anti Corruption Circle, Sargodha 
is quashed.
