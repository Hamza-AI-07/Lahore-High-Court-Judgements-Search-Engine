Mr. Muhammad Din Anjum Samija, Advocate for the 
petitioner. 
Mr. Sajjad Iqbal, Assistant Advocate General with 
Hasam Bin Iqbal, DPO, Mian Abdul Rauf, DSP and 
Muhammad Saleem, SI. 
Mr. Shahid Fareed, Assistant District Public Prosecutor. 
 
Through this petition filed under Section 491 
Cr.P.C, the petitioner supplicated for the recovery of her 
real brother namely Kamran, from the illegal and 
improper custody of respondents through Bailiff of this 
Court. 
2. 
After hearing the arguments of learned counsel for 
the petitioner, a Bailiff was deputed at the expense of 
petitioner for recovery of alleged detenu and his 
production before this Court on 09.10.2023. 
3. 
On 09.10.2023, in compliance with this Court’s 
short order dated 06.10.2023, Muhammad Saleem, SI 
from Police Station City Dunyapur, District Lodhran, 
produced Kamran (detenu) before this Court. Similarly, 
Riaz Ahmad, Bailiff submitted report prepared by Junaid 
Rasheed, Bailiff of this Court who could not appear as 
his father passed away. 
 
After hearing all the concerned and going through 
the police record, this Court while declaring the detention 
of Kamran (detenu) as illegal, set-aside the physical 
remand granting order dated 07.10.2023 passed by Mr. 

2 
Crl. Misc. No. 4043-H of 2023 
 
 
 
Zahid Qayyum, learned Duty Magistrate Section-30, 
Dunyapur, in case FIR No.772/2023, registered with 
Police Station City Dunyapur. Besides this, remand 
granting orders dated 07.10.2023 in two other cases 
bearing FIR Nos. 236/2023 & 544/2023, registered with 
Police Station City Dunyapur, passed by Ms. Rafia 
Qureshi, learned Duty Magistrate Section-30, Dunyapur, 
were also set-aside and Kamran (detenu) was discharged 
in all the above-mentioned three cases. 
4. 
As there were so many manipulations in the case 
diaries of above-mentioned cases, this Court called the 
District Police Officer, Lodhran, in person for hearing 
and justifying the illegal acts of his subordinates. It was 
further mentioned in order dated 09.10.2023 that detailed 
reasonings qua setting aside physical remand granting 
orders dated 07.10.2023 and discharge order in the 
above-mentioned cases will be recorded later on, after 
hearing the District Police Officer, Lodhran.  
5. 
Today, in compliance with this Court’s Order 
dated 09.10.2023, District Police Officer, Lodhran has 
entered appearance before this Court and straightaway 
apprised that he is unable to defend the illegal acts of his 
subordinates and he has already issued show-cause 
notices in the name of Muhammad Imran SHO, 
Muhammad Saleem SI, Muhammad Farooq SI and Iqbal 
Hussain, ASI, Police Station City Dunyapur. 
6. 
According to the report of Bailiff, on 06.10.2023, 
he raided at Police Station City Dunyapur in compliance 
with this Court’s order dated 06.10.2023 for the recovery 
of Kamran (detenu). After reaching Police Station City 
Dunyapur, he entered Rapat No.17 on 06.10.2023 at 

3 
Crl. Misc. No. 4043-H of 2023 
 
 
 
02:50 P.M. According to the above-mentioned Rapat and 
report of Junaid Rasheed, Bailiff, he found Kamran 
(detenu) brother of petitioner, detained in police lock up. 
After checking the register roznamcha, he found arrest of 
detenu incorporated vide Rapat No.12 dated 06.10.2023 
at 09:40 A.M. in case FIR No.772/2023, for an offence 
u/s 381-A PPC, registered with Police Station City 
Dunyapur, however, he was not nominated in FIR. Upon 
query, Kamran (detenu) informed the Bailiff that he was 
arrested eight days ago and uptil now he has not been 
produced before any court of law. On demanding the 
police file, Moharrar of said Police Station stated that the 
same is in the custody of Investigating Officer who has 
proceeded to the office of SP (Investigation). Police file 
was not handed over to the Bailiff, however, Moharrar of 
said Police Station informed the Bailiff that Kamran 
(detenu) is also required in two other cases i.e. FIR 
No.236/2023 & 544/2023 and today i.e. 06.10.2023 he 
will be produced before the court of learned Magistrate 
concerned for the purpose of remand. The Bailiff directed 
Moharrar of said Police Station to inform the SHO about 
the order of this Court and bound down him to produce 
the detenu with complete record, Investigating Officer 
and Moharrar before this Court on 09.10.2023. This 
Court has noticed that despite the above-mentioned clear 
direction, Muhammad Farooq, SI produced Kamran 
(detenu) before the court of Mr. Zahid Qayyum, learned 
Duty Magistrate Section-30, Dunyapur, in case FIR 
No.772/2023, u/s 381-A PPC, registered with Police 
Station City Dunyapur, for the purpose of his physical 
remand. It will not be out of place to mention here that 
register roznamcha (Register No.2) of Police Station City 
Dunyapur is silent about the fact that on 06.10.2023 

4 
Crl. Misc. No. 4043-H of 2023 
 
 
 
Muhammad Saleem, SI/IO proceeded to the office of SP 
(Investigation) alongwith the police file of case FIR 
No.772/2023 u/s 381-A PPC, registered with Police 
Station City Dunyapur. Moreover, it has been mentioned 
in physical remand granting order dated 07.10.2023 in 
case FIR No.772/23 ibid that Muhammad Saleem SI/I.O 
had proceeded to Lodhran vide Rapat No.2 dated 
07.10.2023 and file was produced by the proxy I.O 
Muhammad Farooq as acting SHO, if he had proceeded 
to Lodhran, then there is no explanation that who wrote 
the application for grant of physical remand of Kamran 
(detenu). Similarly, in the remand application, it has no 
where been mentioned that Muhammad Farooq, SI wrote 
application for grant of physical remand of detenu in case 
FIR No.772/2023 on behalf of Muhammad Saleem, SI / 
IO. Furthermore, there is no proof that police file of 
above mentioned FIR was handed over to Muhammad 
Farooq, SI for the purpose of obtaining physical remand 
of Kamran (detenu). Although in the remand granting 
order dated 07.10.2023, Mr. Zahid Qayyum, learned 
Duty Magistrate Section-30, Dunyapur has sought 
explanation from Muhammad Saleem, SI due to non-
production of accused before the court within 24-hours, 
but this Court is of the view that learned Magistrate while 
granting physical remand has not applied his judicial 
mind. Record reflects that Kamran (detenu) was shown to 
be arrested by the Investigating Officer u/s 54 Cr.P.C in 
the above-mentioned case. The first version of accused 
recorded vide case diary No.02 dated 06.10.2023 shows 
that he made extra-judicial confession before the 
Investigating Officer during police custody which was 
not a valid ground for the grant of physical remand 
because confession before the police is not admissible in 

5 
Crl. Misc. No. 4043-H of 2023 
 
 
 
evidence in terms of Articles 38 & 39 of The Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984. Reliance is placed upon the case 
law titled as “Hayatullah vs. The State” (2018 SCMR 
2092) wherein it has been held by the Hon’ble apex 
Court as under:- 
“…6. While going through the evidence 
adduced by the prosecution, we observe, 
with 
great 
concern, 
that inadmissible 
evidence has been brought on the record in 
the shape of admission of the appellant 
before police, memos of pointing out of 
place of occurrence and place from where 
the motorcycle was recovered which were 
already known to the police and the 
complainant party. Such inadmissible pieces 
of evidence, according to law, should not be 
brought on the record. Astonishingly, the 
whole disclosure was incorporated/dictated 
by the trial court when witnesses were 
giving evidence. Neither the prosecutor nor 
the defence made any objection upon 
bringing the said inadmissible pieces of 
evidence on record. The trial court while 
recording the statement of police officials, 
who recorded the confession of the appellant 
Hayatullah about the commission of the 
crime, had totally ignored Articles 38 and 39 
of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 
according to which this type of evidence 
was inadmissible as no new facts were 
discovered on the admission/disclosure of 
the appellant. The pointing out of the place 
of incident and the place of recovery of 
motorcycle cannot be termed as discovery as 
a consequence of information received from 
the appellant within the meanings of Article 
40 of the Qanun- e-Shahadat Order, 1984 as 
the said places were already in the 
knowledge of the police and the complainant 
party so it was also inadmissible evidence. 
The memos about pointing out of place of 
occurrence without recovery prepared by the 
investigating officer should not be allowed 
by the trial court to bring on the record but 
unfortunately such pieces of evidence were 

6 
Crl. Misc. No. 4043-H of 2023 
 
 
 
allowed to be brought on the record 
although were inadmissible….” 
 
7. 
Another intriguing aspect of this case is that on 
07.10.2023, Iqbal Hussain, ASI/I.O obtained physical 
remand of Kamran (detenu) alongwith his three co-
accused in case FIR No.236/2023 from the court of Ms. 
Rafia Qureshi, learned Duty Magistrate Section-30, 
Dunyapur. Similarly, Muhammad Farooq, SI also 
obtained physical remand of Kamran (detenu) alongwith 
his three co-accused in case FIR No.544/2023 from the 
court of above mentioned learned Judicial Officer on 
07.10.2023 till 09.10.2023. Ms. Rafia Qureshi, learned 
Duty Magistrate Section-30, Dunyapur, has also not 
applied her judicial mind and passed both the supra-
mentioned remand orders in a stereotype manner while 
observing that accused persons were arrested u/s 54 
Cr.P.C and investigation is yet to be completed, hence, 
considering the request plausible, physical remand is 
granted. It is noteworthy that in all the above-mentioned 
three cases i.e. FIR Nos.772/2023, 236/2023 and 
544/2023, Kamran (detenu) is neither nominated nor he 
was arrested for the purpose of identification parade. 
Mere fact that Kamran (detenu) disclosed to the 
Investigating Officers of cases bearing FIR Nos.236/2023 
and 544/2023 that he is puzzled at the moment and did 
not remember anything, he be given an opportunity and 
after remembering, he will disclose the facts, was not a 
valid ground for granting his physical remand to the 
police.  

7 
Crl. Misc. No. 4043-H of 2023 
 
 
 
I have noticed that case diary No.3 of FIR 
No.236/2023 is a carbon copy of case diary No.3 of FIR 
No.544/2023 and both case diaries do not bear dates in 
the respective columns as well as at the bottom of case 
diaries.  
8. 
Another crippling feature of this case is that in 
initial columns of case diary No.3 of FIR No.236/2023, 
name of Police Station, District, case diary number, FIR 
number, date, name of Area and offence, name of 
complainant as well as Investigating Officer and at the 
bottom, name of Iqbal Hussain, ASI Police Station 
Dunyapur have been written through pointer whereas it is 
a carbon copy. Moreover, no original case diary No.3 in 
case FIR No.236/2023 is available with the file whereas 
original as well as carbon copies of case diaries No.2 and 
4 are available on file with carbon copies. It is crystal 
clear from the record that manipulations have been made 
in the above-mentioned case diary. 
I have also observed that in case diary No.1 of case 
FIR No.236/2023, columns regarding the name of 
complainant in the start and in the body of case diary as 
well as date and month have been subsequently written 
with ballpoint whereas remaining writing is a carbon 
copy. Original case diary No.1 is also missing in the 
police file. Similarly, names of PWs i.e. Saeed S/O 
Sajjad Qamar Gujjar and Kaleem Ullah S/O Sardar 
Muhammad have been filled with ballpoint. It is 
noteworthy that as per case diary No.2, file of this case 
was handed over to Iqbal Hussain, ASI by Moharrar of 
Police Station but there is no proof on the whole file that 
any competent officer had entrusted the investigation of 
this case to Iqbal Hussain, ASI. When the investigation 

8 
Crl. Misc. No. 4043-H of 2023 
 
 
 
of case FIR No.236/2023 was not handed over to Iqbal 
Hussain ASI by any competent authority, then how he 
arrested Kamran (detenu) in this case.  
I deem it appropriate to mention here that in the 
end of FIR No.544/2023, it has been mentioned that the 
investigation of this case was entrusted to Khalid Shahid, 
SI/Incharge Investigation but all the case diaries in this 
case have been written by Muhammad Farooq, SI Police 
Station Dunyapur whereas there is no order for 
entrustment of investigation to him. I have also noticed 
that statements of Muhammad Irfan 1058-C and 
Muhammad Asif 1042-C were allegedly recorded on 
07.10.2023 by Muhammad Farooq, SI but name of 
above-mentioned Investigating Officer as well as FIR 
number, name of accused and kind of vehicle have also 
been written with pointer whereas other writing is a 
carbon copy. It is important to note here that in all three 
police files, some case diaries are available in original 
alongwith carbon copies but the original case diaries 
pertaining to those wherein tempering has been made, are 
not available, meaning thereby, the Investigating Officers 
of above mentioned FIRs with their active connivance 
and to justify the illegal detention of Kamran (detenu) as 
well as to save the skin of each other, prepared fake and 
fictitious documents and utilized the same as genuine. 
9. 
Record further reflects that arrest of Kamran 
(detenu) in case FIR No.236/2023 and 544/2023 has not 
been incorporated in the register roznamcha of Police 
Station. Moreover, Rapat number, date and time of arrest 
as well as factum of raid of Bailiff of this Court on 
06.10.2023 at Police Station City Dunyapur has not been 
incorporated in the applications for grant of physical 

9 
Crl. Misc. No. 4043-H of 2023 
 
 
 
remand in all the above mentioned three cases. All this 
has been done just to flout and avoid the consequences of 
order dated 06.10.2023 passed by this Court for the 
recovery and production of Kamran (detenu) before this 
Court on 09.10.2023. It is pertinent to mention here that 
rules 22.48 and 22.49 of the Police Rules, 1934 are 
relevant qua Register No.2 which read as under: - 
22.48. Register No. II. - (1) The Daily Diary shall be

10. 
After going through the above-mentioned three 
FIRs, it manifests that neither any accused is nominated 
nor any suspicion has been made against any specific 
person. According to the assertion of Muhammad 
Saleem, SI, he arrested Kamran (detenu) u/s 54 Cr.P.C. 
but it is noteworthy that in crime report, no feature of any 
accused has been described. Necessary ingredients for 
the arrest of any person u/s 54 Cr.P.C. are very much 
missing in this case and same is the situation in other two 
cases. 
To better decide the above issue, it is expedient to 
go through Section 54 Cr.P.C. which is described as 
infra: - 
54. 
When police may arrest without warrant. 
 (1) Any police-officer may, without an order from a 
Magistrate and without a warrant, arrest: 
Firstly, any person who has been concerned in any 
cognizable offence or against whom a reasonable complaint 
has been made or credible information has been received, 
or a reasonable suspicion exists of his having been so 
concerned; 
Secondly, any person having in his possession 
without lawful excuse, the burden of proving which excuse 
shall lie on such person, any implement of house-breaking; 

12 
Crl. Misc. No. 4043-H of 2023 
 
 
 
Thirdly, any person who has been proclaimed as an 
offender either under this Code or by order of the 
Provincial Government; 
Fourthly, any person in whose possession anything 
is found which may reasonably be suspected to be stolen 
property and who may reasonably be suspected of having 
committed an offence with reference to such thing; 
Fifthly, any person who obstructs a police-officer 
while in the execution of his duty or who has been escaped, 
or attempts to escape from lawful custody; 
Sixthly, any person reasonably suspected of being a 
deserter from the armed forces of Pakistan [****]12; 
Seventhly, any person who has been concerned in, 
or against whom a reasonable complaint has been made or 
credible information has been received or a reasonable 
suspicion exists of his having been concerned in, any act 
committed at any place out of Pakistan which, if committed 
in Pakistan, would have been punishable as an offence and, 
for which he is, under any law relating to extradition or 
[****] 13 otherwise, liable to be apprehended or detained in 
custody in Pakistan; 
Eighthly, any released convict committing a breach 
of any rule made under section 565, sub-section (3); 
14[Ninthly, any person for whose arrest a requisition 
has been received from another police officer, provided that 
the requisition specifies the person to be arrested and the 
offence or other cause for which the arrest is to be made 
and it appears therefrom that the person might lawfully be 
arrested without a warrant by the officer who issued the 
requisition.] 
 
It is also noteworthy that Rule 26.1 of the Police 
Rules, 1934 is also relevant for the arrest of any person 
under section 54 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
1898 which reads as under:- 
26.1. General powers of arrest:-Section 54, Code of 
Criminal Procedure, authorizes any police officer to arrest 
without a warrant any person who has been concerned in 
any cognizable offence or against whom a reasonable 
complaint has been made, or credible information has been 
received, or a reasonable suspicion exists, of his having 
been so concerned. The authority given under this section 
to the police to arrest without a warrant is, however, 
permissive and not obligatory. Whenever escape from 
justice or inconvenient delay is likely to result from the 
police failing to arrest, they are bound to do so; but in no 
other cases. The law allows a police officer to apply to a 
magistrate for a warrant or a summons instead of making 

13 
Crl. Misc. No. 4043-H of 2023 
 
 
 
the arrest immediately, and this discretion shall be 
exercised whenever possible and expedient. 
The law also allows a police officer in any bailable case to 
take security under Section 170, Criminal Procedure Code 
from an accused person to appear before a magistrate 
without first arresting him. 
I have also noticed that not a single complainant or 
PW of above-mentioned cases has got recorded his 
statement against the detenu. Mere his extra judicial 
confession before the investigating officer of case FIR 
No. 772/2023 during police custody was not sufficient 
ground for his arrest, as it was not an admissible piece of 
evidence. Similarly, there was no evidence against 
Kamran (detenu) in other two cases. It has been well 
settled by now that arrest of accused cannot be made if 
some sufficient incriminating material is not available 
against him. In this respect guidance is being sought from 
the case law titled as “Shahzada Qaiser Arfat alias 
Qaiser vs. The State and another” (PLD 2021 SC 708) 
wherein it has been held as under:- 
"5. No doubt, a police officer has, under 
section 54 of the Cr.P.C., the power to arrest 
a person who has been involved in any 
cognizable offence or against whom a 
complaint has been made or credible 
information 
has 
been 
received 
or 
a 
reasonable suspicion exists of his having 
been so concerned. Having the power to 
arrest is one thing but the justification for 
the exercise of that power is quite another. A 
police officer that makes arrest of a person 
must be able to justify the exercise of that 
power in making the arrest apart from his 
having the power to do so. He cannot make 
arrest of a person, only because he has the 
power to do so. He must also show 
sufficient grounds for making the arrest. 
Article 4(1)(j) of the Police Order, 2002 
states this legal position when it prescribes 
that it is the duty of every police officer to 

14 
Crl. Misc. No. 4043-H of 2023 
 
 
 
"apprehend all persons whom he is legally 
authorised to apprehend and for whose 
apprehension sufficient grounds exist". And 
Rule 26.1 of the Police Rules, 1934 explains 
this by providing that the authority given 
under Section 54 of the Cr.P.C. to the police 
to arrest without a warrant is permissive and 
not obligatory. As per the said Rule 
whenever 
escape 
from 
justice 
or 
inconvenient delay in completion of the 
investigation or commencement of the trial 
is likely to result from the police failing to 
arrest, they are bound to do so, but in no 
other cases. "Ordinarily no person is to be 
arrested straightaway only because he has 
been nominated as an accused person in an 
FIR or in any other version of the incident 
brought to the notice of the investigating 
officer by any person until the investigating 
officer 
feels 
satisfied 
that 
sufficient 
justification exists for his arrest."3 The 
investigating 
officers 
should 
not 
mechanically make the arrest of a person 
accused of having committed a cognizable 
offence, rather they must exercise their 
discretion in making the arrest of such 
person judiciously by applying their mind to 
the particular facts and circumstances of the 
case 
and consciously considering 
the 
question: what purpose will be served and 
what object will be achieved by arrest of the 
accused person?...” 
Further, reference can also be made to the case 
titled “Khawaja Salman Rafique and another vs. 
National Accountability Bureau through Chairman and 
others” (PLD 2020 SC 456), wherein, in paragraph 
No.72 of which, the  Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan 
has observed as infra:- 
“…72. Arrest of any person is a grave 
matter. Capricious exercise of the power to 
arrest has deleterious consequences, thus 
highlighting the need to exercise it with 
care, caution and sensitivity. Arrest of a 
person has to be justified not only by 

15 
Crl. Misc. No. 4043-H of 2023 
 
 
 
referring to prima facie evidence and 
adequate actionable material sufficiently 
connecting 
the 
person 
with 
the 
offence/crime complained of, but also by 
showing that in the given circumstances, 
there were no other less intrusive or 
restrictive means available. The power of 
arrest should not be deployed as a tool of 
oppression and harassment…” 
 
In the light of above discussion, I am quite 
confident to hold that there was no sufficient evidence 
against the detenu for causing his arrest in the above-
mentioned three cases. Moreover,  both the learned 
Judicial Magistrates while granting physical remands in 
the above-mentioned cases have not applied their judicial 
mind sagaciously and they have also ignored the 
directions issued by this Court in case titled as “Qari 
MUHAMMAD ATTA ULLAH Versus DISTRICT POLICE 
OFFICER, SIALKOT and another” (PLD 2022 Lahore 
224), therefore, they are directed to remain careful in 
future.  
 
It is also held that arrest of any person cannot be 
made without any evidence. This Court has also observed 
that in such like cases police oftenly arrest the accused  
on the ground that the complainant has strong suspicion 
or firm belief against him. Similarly, using the term that 
the complainant has come to know through reliable 
source (without disclosing that source) or land lord’s clue                     
(زدنیمارہ وگڑی) that any person is involved in the commission 
of crime, is also not a legal evidence and arrest cannot be 
made solely on this ground.  
After going through the evidence on files of above-
mentioned FIRs, it divulges that neither any reasonable 
complaint has been made nor credible information has 

16 
Crl. Misc. No. 4043-H of 2023 
 
 
 
been received and no reasonable suspicion exists against 
Kamran (detenu) to justify his arrest therein. Moreover, 
all the police files are silent that the detenu was arrested 
for the purpose of identification parade.  
11. 
It is also necessary to mention here that police file 
was not handed over to the Bailiff of this Court rather it 
was stated by the Moharrar that police file was with the 
Investigating Officer of the case who was not available at 
Police Station at the time of Bailiff’s raid. After going 
through the register roznamcha of Police Station City 
Dunyapur, it is crystal clear that no Rapat has been 
incorporated regarding departure of Muhammad Saleem, 
SI/IO from the Police Station alongwith police file of 
above-mentioned case for any purpose. It has been 
directed by this Court in case titled as “Qari 
MUHAMMAD ATTA ULLAH Versus DISTRICT POLICE 
OFFICER, SIALKOT and another” (PLD 2022 Lahore 
224) as under: - 
“To curb down the illegal practice of police officials qua 
the arrest and production of accused before learned Area 
Magistrate, the Court would like to issue following 
directions:-  
i) Whenever, a person is arrested in any case, his arrest 
be incorporated forthwith in computerized as well as 
manual roznamcha with date and time; 
ii) Similarly, when an accused is taken out from the 
police station for any purpose, a rapat should be written 
in this regard, vice versa on his return this practice 
should be adopted; 
iii) To make the process of entry in roznamcha 
transparent, it is ordered that entries in manual 
roznamcha (register No. 2) be made through ball-point. 
iv) More so, when the accused will be produced before 
the learned Area Magistrate for the physical or judicial 
remand, date and time of arrest must has been 
mentioned in the application for obtaining remand and 
in case of failure, learned Area Magistrate should refuse 
to entertain request of remand. 

17 
Crl. Misc. No. 4043-H of 2023 
 
 
 
v) Police file/ case diaries should be retained at police 
station as provided in Rule 25.55 (3) of Police Rules, 
1934 and whenever the investigating officer will 
proceed along with police file of case from police 
station for the purpose of investigation or any other 
purpose that facts should be incorporated in the 
roznamcha (register No. 2) and on return the same 
practice be also adopted, other than this, police file 
must be retained at police station. 
Any defiance of supra mentioned directions, would amount 
to contempt of court and delinquent official/officers will 
also be proceedable under section 155-C of Police Order, 
2002. 
 
In the eventuality of above-mentioned circs, I am 
quite confident to hold that Kamran (detenu) was 
illegally detained by Muhammad Saleem SI, Muhammad 
Farooq SI and Iqbal Hussain ASI as there is no evidence 
which could connect him with the commission of crime. 
Resultantly, while exercising my powers under Section 
561-A Cr.P.C. as well as in terms of Rule 3 Part F, 
Chapter 4 of the High Court Rules & Orders Volume-5, I 
have already discharged Kamran (detenu) in all the 
above-mentioned three cases while setting aside physical 
remand granting orders dated 07.10.2023 passed by 
Mr.Zahid Qayyum, learned Duty Magistrate Section-30, 
Dunyapur as well as Ms. Rafia Qureshi, learned Duty 
Magistrate Section-30, Dunyapur through short order 
dated 09.10.2023. Above are the detailed reasonings of 
my short order dated 09.10.2023. 
12. 
Before parting with this order, it is vivid that 
Muhammad Saleem SI, Muhammad Farooq SI, and Iqbal 
Hussain, ASI have illegally detained Kamran. Similarly, 
Muhammad Saleem, SI retained the police file with him 
without any justifiable reasoning in defiance of clear 
directions issued  by this Court in “Qari Muhammad 
Atta Ullah’s” case supra. Therefore, prima facie, 
Muhammad Saleem, SI, Muhammad Farooq, SI and 

18 
Crl. Misc. No. 4043-H of 2023 
 
 
 
Iqbal Hussain, ASI Police Station City Dunyapur with 
their active connivance have prepared forged documents 
and utilized the same in the courts to obtain physical 
remand of Kamran (detenu). In this way, they have 
committed offences u/s 342, 420, 468 & 471 PPC, read 
with Article 155-C of Police Order, 2002. The District 
Police Officer, Lodhran is directed to get register an FIR 
against the above-mentioned police officials forthwith 
under the above said provisions of law on the application 
of Kamran (detenu) under intimation to the Deputy 
Registrar (Judicial) of this Bench. To eliminate the 
excuse for non-registration of FIR on the ground that in 
case Kamran (detenu) has not appeared before the police 
for getting registration of case, the District Police 
Officer, Lodhran is directed to get FIR registered against 
the above-mentioned delinquent police officials through 
any of his subordinates who must be fully conversant 
with the facts of instant case, as this case is mostly reliant 
upon the documentary evidence in the shape of above-
mentioned three FIRs, case diary No.2 of FIR 
No.772/2023, case diary No.3 of FIR No.236/2023 and 
case diary No.3 of FIR No.544/2023. In the last two 
cases, clear tempering has been made in case diaries.  
After the registration of FIR, Investigating Officer of that 
very case is directed to take into possession copy of 
above-mentioned three FIRs, case diary No.3 of FIR 
No.772/2023, carbon copy of case diary No.1 of FIR 
No.236/2023, carbon copy of case diary No.3 of FIR 
No.236/2023, carbon copy of unscaled site-plan of place 
of recovery of amount from Nisar Ahmad, co-accused in 
case FIR No.236/2023, case diaries No.1, 2 and 3 of FIR 
No.544/2023, similarly, carbon copy of statements of 
Muhammad Irfan 1058-C and Muhammad Asif 1042-C 

19 
Crl. Misc. No. 4043-H of 2023 
 
 
 
u/s 161 Cr.P.C in case FIR No.544/2023, copy of all the 
Rapats entered in Register No.2 of Police Station City 
Dunyapur on 06.10.2023. Investigating Officer is also 
directed to get the comparison of handwritings of case 
diaries of above-mentioned cases from the handwriting 
expert of PFSA because the case diaries in all the above-
mentioned three cases seem to be of one handwriting. He 
is further directed to get the comparison of handwritings 
of all three delinquent police officials with the 
handwritings of case diaries of their respective cases. 
A direction is issued to the Office to retain copies 
of all the case diaries of the abovesaid three cases in the 
judicial 
file 
of 
this 
case 
so 
that 
no 
further      
manipulation/tempering could be done by the police 
officials.  
13. 
Further, before parting with this Order, I would 
like to issue following directions: - 
(i) 
No arrest shall be made on the ground that 
complainant has a strong suspicion or firm 
belief that any person is involved in any 
case; similarly, complainant has come to 
know through reliable source (without 
disclosing that source) or landlord’s clue 
(زدنیمارہ وگڑی) that accused is involved in the 
occurrence because the abovesaid terms 
cannot be taken as legal evidence, however, 
arrest can be made if any corroborative and 
convincing evidence is available against the 
accused. 
(ii). 
No police officer shall investigate any 
criminal case until and unless investigation 
is entrusted to him. Similarly, he shall not 
conduct the investigation of any case  of his 
own accord. Either the investigation should 
be entrusted to him in terms of  Police 
Order, 2002 or in case of transfer of any 
Investigating Officer  from the police station 
then same should be entrusted to him by the 

20 
Crl. Misc. No. 4043-H of 2023 
 
 
 
competent authority with written order. 
Factum of entrustment of investigation to 
any Investigating Officer shall be entered in 
register roznamcha (register No.2) of the 
police station and this fact should also be 
mentioned in case diary also. 
(iii) 
While seeking remand, the Investigating 
Officers shall briefly describe the evidence 
against 
the 
accused 
in 
the 
remand 
applications and while entertaining the 
remand applications, the learned Area 
Magistrates shall apply their judicial minds 
and then pass speaking orders for grant of 
physical or judicial remand. 
(iv) 
It is also directed that in future remand 
application shall be prepared in the light of 
Police Rules, 1934 and Rapat No. date as 
well as time of arrest of accused must be 
mentioned therein, in case of failure, the 
learned Magistrate concerned, should refuse 
to entertain the remand application. 
14.

order  to all the learned Sessions Judges of the Province 
of Punjab, Inspector General of Police, Punjab, Lahore,

General,
