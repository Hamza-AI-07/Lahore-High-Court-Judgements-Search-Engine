Date of hearing:     23.04.2024. 
Petitioner by: 
Rao Muhammad Adnan Jamshaid Khan, 
Advocate. 
Respondents by: 
Syed Wajid Hussain Rizvi, Assisaatant 
Advocate General.  
 
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.- 
Through instant petition, petitioner has assailed vires of order 
dated 18.01.2021, passed by respondent No. 2 / Divisional 
Forest Officer, Layyah Forest Division, Layyah, whereby 
inquiry proceedings were initiated against petitioner under 
Section 3 of the Punjab Employees, Efficiency, Discipline and 
Accountability Act, 2006 (“PEEDA, 2006”) on the charges of 
inefficiency and misconduct, with the allegation that during 
petitioner’s posting as Forest Guard, a damage of 466 trees 
worth Rs.40,26,500/- was sustained in his beat / block i.e. Dad 
Block.  
2. 
Learned counsel for petitioner submits that petitioner was 
issued a show cause notice and after completing all the codal 
formalities, he was exonerated vide order dated 08.05.2019, 
therefore, he could not have been proceeded again against same 
charges. He adds that under the provisions of PEEDA, 2006, 
respondent No.2 has no power to review his earlier order, 
especially when order dated 08.05.2019 had attained finality. 
He argues that under Article 13 of the Constitution of the 

 
W. P. No.1532 of 2021 
2
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, no one can be punished 
twice with the same allegation and said provision protects the 
citizens from double jeopardy. He contends that in fact inquiry 
was initiated only against respondents No.7 to 9, and petitioner 
was wrongly held responsible for shortage of the trees, thus, the 
Inquiry Officer has travelled beyond his jurisdiction.  
3. 
When confronted, learned Law Officer could not deny 
the above submission that in presence of order dated 08.05.2019 
withdrawing show cause notice issued against petitioner, de 
novo inquiry proceedings could not have been initiated against 
him, however submits that instant writ petition is not 
maintainable against order of initiation of inquiry proceedings.

Heard. Available record perused.  
5. 
Record shows that a show cause notice dated 05.01.2019 
was issued against petitioner while he was holding additional 
charge of Dad Block, a shortage of 528 trees was observed for 
which the government sustained a heavy loss, thus an enquiry 
was initiated in the matter. Petitioner tendered reply to the show 
cause notice and the Range Forest Officer submitted report in 
petitioner’s favour by observing that balance shortage of 676 
trees from Hayat Disty, 150 trees from 3/R Minor Hayat and 46 
trees from Lal Minor existed and he proposed initiation of 
disciplinary action against one Azhar Abbas, Forest Guard, the 
then Incharge of Hayat Tail Beat. In this backdrop, show cause 
notice dated 05.01.2019, issued against petitioner, was 
withdrawn vide order dated 08.05.2019, passed by respondent 
No.2. Subsequently, inquiry proceedings were initiated against 
Adnan Yousaf, Forester, Muhammad Amanullah, Forest Guard 
and Azhar Abbas, Forest Guard, however they were also 
exonerated vide order dated 18.01.2021, passed by respondent 
No.2, again petitioner was held responsible and impugned show 
cause notice was issued against him.  
6. 
 The matter was one and the same and the competent 
authority was also the same. A detailed inquiry ended in 

 
W. P. No.1532 of 2021 
3
petitioner’s support and upon receipt of inquiry report, three 
options or courses of action were available with the competent 
authority, who could either exonerate petitioner or punish him 
or order a de novo inquiry, if it was satisfied that inquiry 
proceedings were not conducted lawfully or on merits. In this 
case, the competent authority exonerated petitioner, thus it 
could not initiate fresh or de novo inquiry proceedings against 
him. Since there is no provision in the relevant law which 
empowered respondent No. 2 to review his own previous 
decision to withdraw the disciplinary proceedings initiated 
against petitioner, I am of the view that the impugned order to 
re-initiate inquiry proceedings against petitioner is without 
lawful authority. The competent authority cannot reopen the 
matter against the petitioner as it is settled law that one cannot 
be vexed twice for the same cause. Reliance in this regard can 
be placed upon Javed Maqbool Bhatti v. Secretary, Irrigation 
and Power Department [1998 PLC (C.S.) 208], Mrs. Khalida 
Amjad v. Government of the Punjab through Secretary of 
Education, Lahore and another [2009 PLC (C.S.) 1], 
Muhammad Tariq Saeed and 2 others v. Government of the 
Punjab through Secretary Forest, Wildlife and Fisheries 
Department and 2 others [2011 PLC (C.S.) 884] and Rana 
Tahir Hassan Khan v. Capital Development Authority and 
others (2022 CLC 454).  
7. 
Needless to observe here that once disciplinary 
proceedings were dropped by the respondent-authority, there 
was no occasion to again proceed against petitioner for same 
charges. Such act of authorities is against the principles of 
natural justice as initiating fresh proceedings did not mean that 
civil servant should be proceeded again on the same charges, 
which were not found correct in earlier proceedings. Inquiry can 
only be conducted if there are charges other than the earlier 
charges on which show cause notice / disciplinary proceedings 
was withdrawn / dropped. Reliance 
is placed upon 

 
W. P. No.1532 of 2021 
4
Administrator/Pakistan Defence Officers Housing Authority 
Karachi v. Ghulam Mustafa Khan and another (2011 SCMR 
480). 
8. 
So far as argument of learned Law Officer that instant 
petition is not maintainable against initiation of inquiry 
proceedings is concerned, suffice it to say that since 
petitioner has undergone the process of earlier inquiry and 
subsequent inquiry proceedings are illegal and unlawful 
under well-settled principles of law, thus, the same can be 
questioned before this Court, especially when appeal before 
the Service Tribunal lies only against final order. Therefore, 
this objection, being misconceived, is repelled. Reference can 
be made to Hasanat Gul and 8 others v. The Chief Minister, 
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through Principal Secretary [2018 P L C 
(C.S.) Note 48] 
9. 
Needless to observe here that public functionaries owe a 
fiduciary duty to act in good faith and discharge their duties 
with honesty and in accordance with law. Public functionaries 
are expected to perform their duties fairly, justly and well 
within the prescribed limits of the law of the land. Omissions 
and actions of public functionary while in authority, shall not be 
limited to himself but sure to prejudice rights and obligations of 
others, if he fails to do justice with the assigned duties.  
10. 
In view of the above discussion, instant petition is 
allowed. Consequently, impugned order dated 18.01.2021, 
passed by respondent No. 2 is set aside being illegal and 
without lawful authority to the extent of petitioner.
