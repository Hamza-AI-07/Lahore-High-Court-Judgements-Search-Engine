Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – On 20.9.2020, Tassaduq 
Hussain went missing, and the following day, around noon, his body was 
found in Square No.54, Killa No.5 in Chak No. 146/R.B., near the 
Rajbah. He had marks of violence on his body and appeared to have 
been murdered by strangulation. His grandfather, Muhammad Aslam 
(Respondent No.3), lodged FIR No. 454/2020 dated 21.9.2020 at Police 
Station Sahianwala, Faisalabad, against unknown persons regarding his 
murder. A team of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) came to 
the crime site and took samples from Tassaduq Hussain, including 
buccal swabs, nail swabs, and the piece of cloth knotted around his neck, 
which are duly preserved with the PFSA. 
2. 
 
On 5.10.2020, Respondent No.3 nominated the Petitioner in 
the above-mentioned case. The police arrested him and, during the 
investigation, found that he had murdered Tassaduq Hussain. On 
2.3.2021, the Additional Sessions Judge, Faisalabad, indicted him. His 
trial is in progress, and the prosecution has recorded eight witnesses.

3. 
 
On 25.9.2021, Respondent No.3 moved the trial court for 
the Petitioner’s DNA test and comparison with Tassaduq Hussain’s 
samples kept at the PFSA. The Additional Sessions Judge accepted that 
application vide Order dated 11.11.2021 (the “Impugned Order”). The 
Petitioner has assailed it in this revision petition under sections 435/439 
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. 
4. 
 
The Petitioner’s counsel contends that the Impugned Order 
violates Article 13(b) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”) because the Petitioner cannot be 
forced to be a witness against himself. He submits that the Petitioner was 
arrested on 15.11.2020 and was held on physical remand until 
30.11.2020, but the Investigating Officer did not take him to the PFSA 
for a DNA test. That test cannot be done now because eight prosecution 
witnesses have been recorded. The counsel maintains that the Impugned 
Order will prejudice the Petitioner as it will help the prosecution fill 
lacunae in its case. 
5. 
 
The Deputy Prosecutor General has supported the 
Impugned Order. He submits that Article 164 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 
1984 (“QSO”), allows the production of evidence made possible by 
modern devices or techniques. It may be permitted even during the trial 
because the court must do justice. The Deputy Prosecutor General 
controverts the Petitioner’s contention that the Impugned Order infringes 
on his fundamental right under Article 13(b) of the Constitution. 
6. 
 
The counsel for Respondent No.3 states that the Petitioner’s 
DNA test was crucial because the present case is based on circumstantial 
evidence. The Investigating Officer did not have it done due to oversight 
or a corrupt motive. The complainant party cannot be penalized for his 
omission/lapse. Fairness of trial means as much to it as the accused. The 
Petitioner’s DNA test would help in the just decision of the case. It may 
even work in his favour because a negative report would clear him of the 
charge. The counsel supports the Law Officer’s contention that the DNA 
test would not violate the Petitioner’s constitutional right under Article 
13(b).

Discussion 
7. 
 
DNA is an abbreviation for deoxyribonucleic acid. It is a 
complex molecule in human cells comprising two nucleotide strands 
arranged differently for each individual except identical twins. New 
technology enables DNA analysts to determine the arrangement of these 
strands, creating unique DNA profiles.1 DNA technology is helping in 
criminal investigations, paternity testing and genealogical and medical 
research. DNA fingerprinting, DNA profiling, and DNA typing are the 
procedures used in identification testing. Although these tests have some 
technical differences, the terms are sometimes used interchangeably.2 
8. 
 
DNA is more than just a unique personal identification 
code.  It may also provide details regarding a person’s physical traits and 
ancestry. In law enforcement, DNA profiles serve as “genetic 
fingerprints” that aid in identifying the perpetrators and their crimes. 
Law enforcement officers collect DNA samples from specific categories 
of people, such as criminal suspects and convicts. Compulsory DNA 
collection generally involves blood or saliva samples rather than finger 
impressions, and DNA profiles can later be compared to any biological 
matter found at crime scenes. Therefore, rather than being a supplement, 
DNA matching is a necessary complement to fingerprint analysis in 
identifying criminal suspects.3 The Supreme Court of Pakistan 
recognized its importance in Salman Akram Raja and another v. 
Government of Punjab and others (2013 SCMR 203) and more recently 
in Ali Haider alias Papu v. Jameel Hussain and others  
(PLD 2021 SC 362). It is considered “one of the strongest corroborative 
pieces of evidence” due to its accuracy and conclusiveness. 
9. 
 
DNA test is considered a threat to a person’s privacy, so 
there have always been voices against it. In criminal cases, it is also 
challenged on the ground that it violates the accused’s fundamental

rights, including the protection against self-incrimination. Hence, the 
first question for consideration in the present case is whether Article 
13(b) of our Constitution of 1973 allows the collection and analysis of 
DNA from people arrested and charged with serious crimes. 
10. 
 
The international human rights instruments recognize the 
inter-relationship between the “right against self-incrimination” and the 
“right to a fair trial.” Article 14(3)(g) of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) (1966) lists the minimum protections 
that must be provided to an accused during a trial. It states that everyone 
has a right “not to be compelled to testify against himself or to confess 
guilt.” Article 6(1) of the European Convention for the Protection of 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (1950) states that every 
person charged with an offence has a right to a fair trial, and Article 6(2) 
provides that “everybody charged with a criminal offence shall be 
presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.” The provision 
of “presumption of innocence” is inextricably linked to the right against 
self-incrimination because compelling the accused to testify would shift 
the burden of proof from the prosecution to the accused.4 
11. 
 
Most countries also recognize the above-mentioned affinity 
between the two rights. The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution 
incorporates the privilege against self-incrimination, and courts have 
held that it is also connected to other fundamental rights, such as 
protection against unreasonable search and seizure (Fourth Amendment) 
and the guarantee of due process of law (Fourteenth Amendment). 
12. 
 
In the United States, DNA tests of the people accused or 
convicted of crimes and the creation of law enforcement databanks and 
databases have generally been challenged on the basis of the Fifth and 
Fourteenth Amendments. Despite strong dissents, the Supreme Court has 
consistently maintained that the privilege against self-incrimination 
applies only to “testimonial” communications. Fingerprints, blood, and 
DNA samples are not regarded as testimonials because they are not acts 
of communication. Even compelled voice samples were determined not

to violate the Fifth Amendment since they were simply used to assess 
physical traits and “not for the testimonial or communicative content of 
what was to be said.” Therefore, the Fifth Amendment privilege does not 
protect a person from being forced by the government to give blood or 
other biological samples. In Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757 
(1966), a man was arrested at a hospital while receiving treatment for 
injuries sustained in an accident involving the automobile he had been 
driving. Despite his protests, a doctor at the hospital drew a blood 
sample at the police officer’s request. Chemical tests revealed that the 
man’s blood alcohol level was very high. He was convicted of driving 
while intoxicated. The Supreme Court affirmed his conviction, 
notwithstanding his claim that the forced extraction of his blood 
compelled him to be a witness against himself. The majority explained: 
“Not even a shadow of testimonial compulsion upon or enforced 
communication by the accused was involved either in the extraction 
or in the chemical analysis. Petitioner’s testimonial capacities were in 
no way implicated; indeed, his participation, except as a donor, was 
irrelevant to the results of the test, which depend on chemical analysis 
and on that alone. Since the blood test evidence, although an 
incriminating product of compulsion, was neither petitioner's 
testimony nor evidence relating to some communicative act or writing 
by the petitioner, it was not inadmissible on privilege grounds.” 
13. 
 
In Boling v. Romer, 101 F.3d 1336, 1340 (10th Cir. 1996), 
the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit stated that the claim that 
“requiring DNA samples from inmates amounts to compulsory self-
incrimination fails because DNA samples are not testimonial in nature.” 
14. 
 
The courts in the United States have also rejected the 
challenge to DNA tests based on the Fourth Amendment. They have 
upheld laws authorizing law enforcement agencies to collect DNA 
compulsorily, applying different legal standards to determine what 
constitutes reasonableness in terms of the said Amendment. The early 
cases looked at the collection of DNA from people who had been 
convicted of criminal charges. Recent state and federal legislation allows 
the collection of such samples from people who have been arrested or 
detained but not convicted. In Maryland v. King, 569 U.S. 435 (2013), 
the Maryland DNA Data Collection Act was challenged, which 
empowers state and local law enforcement officers to take DNA samples 

Crl. Revision No.71205/2021 
 
- 6 - 
from people arrested for violent crimes, burglaries or attempting to 
commit these offences. The issue before the U.S. Supreme Court was 
whether the Fourth Amendment allows it. In a 5-4 opinion authored by 
Justice Kennedy, the Supreme Court stated that using a buccal swab 
inside a person’s cheek to collect a DNA sample does constitute a search 
within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, but its constitutionality 
would depend on whether it can be termed reasonable. The 
“reasonableness” of a search is determined by evaluating legitimate 
governmental objectives against the extent to which the search intrudes 
on an individual’s privacy. Because the government needs to know “who 
has been arrested and who is being tried,” and DNA testing helps law 
enforcement officers identify the perpetrators of a crime, it is crucial in 
advancing the government’s interests. The intrusion of a cheek swab to 
get a DNA sample is small compared to the significant government 
interest and the unique efficacy of DNA identification. Reasonableness 
must be considered in the context of an individual’s legitimate privacy 
expectations, which diminish when police take him into custody. Justice 
Kennedy compared the DNA collection with the police practices of 
taking photographs and fingerprints of arrestees and stated that DNA 
collection performed the same function more efficaciously. 
15. 
 
In India, Article 20(3) of the Constitution states: “No person 
accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against 
himself.” According to Basu, this clause follows the language of the 
Fifth Amendment to the American Constitution, but the rule laid down 
in the Indian Constitution is narrower than the American rule as 
expanded by interpretation.5 In M. P. Sharma v. Satish Chandra and 
others (AIR 1954 SC 300), the Indian Supreme Court observed that 
Article 20(3) uses the phrase “to be a witness” rather than “to appear as 
a witness.” The protection granted to an accused in relation to the 
expression “to be a witness” is not limited to testimonial compulsion in 
the courtroom but may well extend to compelled evidence obtained from 
him previously. Therefore, it is available to a person against whom there

is a formal accusation of committing a crime, which could result in 
prosecution in the normal course. 
16. 
 
In 
State 
of 
Bombay 
v. 
Kathi 
Kalu 
Oghad  
(AIR 1961 SC 1808), the Indian Supreme Court stated that it is as 
important to empower law enforcement officers to prosecute the 
offender as to protect an accused from being forced to incriminate 
himself. The Court held that the phrase “to be a witness” in Article 20(3) 
of the Indian Constitution means imparting knowledge or information 
about relevant facts, either orally or in writing, by a person who has 
personal knowledge thereof to a court or a person conducting an enquiry 
or investigation. It excludes the mechanical process of simply producing 
documents in the court that may shed light on any of the issues under 
consideration. For example, the accused person may possess a document 
which is in his writing or bears his signature or thumb impression. The 
submission of such a document to compare the writing, signature, or 
impression is not an accused person’s statement, which can be regarded 
as personal testimony. Similarly, when the court or any investigating 
agency requires an accused person to provide his finger impression, 
signature, or handwriting specimen, he is not presenting “personal 
testimony”. Giving a “personal testimony” must be voluntary on his part. 
He has the choice of making any statement or saying nothing at all, but 
despite his greatest efforts to conceal the genuineness of his handwriting 
or finger impressions through dissimulation, he cannot change them. 
Thus, the giving of finger impressions or specimen writing, or signatures 
by an accused person may amount to furnishing evidence in the broad 
sense, but it is not included in the expression “to be a witness”. 
17. 
 
In Nandini Satpathy v. Dani (P.L) and another 
(AIR 1978 SC 1025), the Indian Supreme Court ruled that the restrictive 
sweep of Article 20(3) begins at the stage of police interrogation, not in 
court. It went on to say that the prohibition on self-accusation and the 
right to remain silent during an investigation or trial extends beyond that 
case and protects the accused regarding other pending or imminent 
offences, which may deter him from voluntary disclosure of a 

Crl. Revision No.71205/2021

criminatory matter. Krishna Iyer J. wrote that compelled testimony is 
“evidence procured not merely by physical threats or violence, but by 
psychic torture, atmospheric pressure, environmental coercion, tiring 
interrogative prolixity, overbearing and intimidatory methods and the 
like – not the legal penalty for violation. So, the legal perils following 
upon refusal to answer, or answer truthfully, cannot be regarded as 
compulsion within the meaning of Article 20(3). The prospect of 
prosecution may lead to legal tension in the exercise of a constitutional 
right, but then, a stance of silence is running a calculated risk. On the 
other hand, if there is any mode of pressure, subtle or crude, mental or 
physical, direct or indirect, but sufficiently substantial, applied by the 
policeman for obtaining information from an accused strongly 
suggestive of guilt, it becomes ‘compelled testimony’, violative of 
Article 20(3). A police officer is clearly a person in authority. Insistence 
on answering is a form of pressure, especially in the atmosphere of the 
police station, unless certain safeguards erasing duress are adhered to. 
Frequent threats of prosecution, if there is failure to answer, may take on 
the complexion of undue pressure violating Article 20(3).” 
18. 
 
In Ritesh Sinha v. State of U.P. (AIR 2013 SC 1132), the 
Indian Supreme Court ruled that directing the accused to give his voice 
sample was not a testimony by itself to infringe Article 20(3). 
19. 
 
It is necessary to refer to Gautam Kundu v. State of West 
Bengal (AIR 1993 SC 2295), which is often cited for opposing a request 
for a blood test. This case has some unusual facts and must be read in 
that context. The girl lived with her husband for some time after 
marriage before returning to her parents’ house to study for the Higher 
Secondary Examination. In the meantime, she became pregnant. The 
husband and his family asked her to have an abortion, but she refused 
and gave birth to a child. The girl petitioned for maintenance under 
section 125 of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure 1973. The 
husband denied paternity and wanted a blood group test. He argued that 
if it was shown that he was not the child’s father, he would not be 
obligated to pay maintenance. The Supreme Court ruled that the 

Crl. Revision No.71205/2021 
 
- 9 - 
husband’s motion could not be granted because it was to avoid the 
payment of maintenance. It further stated that (i) the courts in India 
cannot order blood tests as a matter of course; (ii) wherever applications 
are made for such prayers to have a roving inquiry, the prayer for a 
blood test cannot be entertained; (iii) there must be a strong prima facie 
case in which the husband must establish non-access to dispel the 
presumption arising under section 112 of the Evidence Act;6 (iv) the 
court must carefully examine as to what would be the consequence of 
ordering the blood test; whether it will have the effect of branding a 
child as a bastard and the mother as an unchaste woman; and (v) no one 
can be compelled to give a sample of blood for analysis. And, no adverse 
inference can be drawn against him for his refusal. 
20. 
 
India 
has 
enacted 
the 
Criminal 
Procedure 
Code 
(Amendment) Act, 2005 to facilitate the investigation of criminal cases 
and overcome the obstacles of gathering evidence by utilizing cutting-
edge techniques. The said Act has introduced two additional provisions 
in the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 that allow medical 
examination of the accused and the victim of sexual assault and taking 
samples from their person for DNA profiling. 
21. 
 
Article 13(b) of the Constitution of 1973 is relevant to the 
discourse in Pakistan. It is similar to Article 20(3) of the Indian 
Constitution and reads as under: 
13. 
Protection 
against 
double 
punishment 
and 
self-
incrimination. No person – 
(a) 
… 
(b) 
shall, when accused of an offence, be compelled to be a 
witness against himself. 
22. 
 
In Syed Ikram Gardezi v. The State and another  
(1980 PCr.LJ 941), this Court held that Article 13 of the Constitution, 
which guarantees that no person shall be forced to be a witness against 
himself when accused of an infraction, has given constitutional status to 
the rule previously codified in section 340(2) Cr.P.C. Calling upon an 
accused to produce a document is one thing, and to compel him to testify 
                                          
6 Refer to Article 128 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984.

against himself is quite another. The two cannot be equated. If the 
argument is accepted that the material collected from the accused under 
section 94 or 96 Cr.P.C. cannot be used as evidence against the accused 
for being ultra vires of Article 13 of the Constitution, a slew of other 
statutory provisions will have to be struck down. The learned Judge 
added that the term “person” in section 94 of Cr.P.C. includes an 
accused. Limiting the said term’s meaning would amount to legislation, 
which judges cannot do under the guise of interpreting the statutory 
provisions. Any judgment of the Indian courts holding otherwise is not 
binding on the courts in Pakistan. 
23. 
 
In Alpha Insurance Company Limited and others v. 
United Insurance Company of Pakistan Limited and another  
(1996 SCMR 1668), the Supreme Court of Pakistan held that for the 
protection of Article 13(b) to be available, there must be a person 
accused of an offence, there should be some sort of compulsion, and the 
objective should be to make the accused a witness against himself. The 
term “compel” connotes constraint and coercion, which can be physical 
or intangible. Article 13(b) expressly excludes (i) the voluntary 
presentation of incriminatory material; (ii) the production of non-
incriminatory material that may aid the investigation or even exonerate 
the accused; and (iii) the production of incriminating material otherwise 
than through compulsion. The prohibition attaches only to the 
incriminating material that the accused does not want to produce. It is 
the accused’s privilege which is exercisable against the whole world. 
The accused can also waive it. To exclude an accused from section 94(1) 
Cr.P.C. would be unjustified because the accused under that section can 
still be called upon to produce evidence that is not incriminating, which 
exonerates him, or which he is prepared to submit voluntarily. The 
Supreme Court added that merely asking an accused to produce a 
document or other things in his possession would not ipso facto mean he 
is compelled to be a witness against himself. It further said: 
“As regards the protection afforded by [Article 13(b)], if the accused 
considers any piece of evidence as incriminating him, the privilege 
granted can be claimed. He has to refer the authority, be it police or 
court or any other, to his privilege and the exercise of it by him. The 

Crl. Revision No.71205/2021 
 
- 11 -
police are not competent to determine whether the privilege has been 
properly exercised by him or not. Its exercise is sufficient for it to 
hold its hands. The police thereafter cannot take the coercive steps 
reserved for it under section 94 Cr.P.C. for getting through the 
accused such documents. Independently of the accused, there is no 
restraint on its power of recovery, seizure and custody. Just like a 
privileged document, a person can be asked to produce it during the 
proceedings, and the person exercising authority over it can claim the 
privilege or waive it to produce it before the authority. This choice to 
exercise the privilege can be adjudicated only in court and not 
elsewhere. Similarly, the exercise of privilege and protection against 
incrimination enjoyed by the accused cannot be adjudicated by any 
authority other than the court and the court will take note of it when 
the protection is claimed. There is, therefore, no need to exclude the 
accused from section 94 Cr.P.C.” 
24. 
 
In Abdul Latif Aassi v. The State (1999 MLD 1069 :  
2001 PCr.LJ 548), this Court upheld the order of the Special Judge, 
Anti-Corruption, passed during the trial whereby he directed that certain 
documents be sent to the handwriting expert for comparison with the 
admitted documents. 
25. 
 
In Pakistan, DNA tests are considered valuable for 
delivering justice in criminal cases. Several provisions furnish the legal 
framework for their admissibility. Article 59 of QSO states that expert 
opinion on the matters such as science and art falls within the ambit of 
“relevant evidence”. Under this provision, the technician who conducts 
experiments to scrutinize DNA evidence is regarded as an expert whose 
opinion is admissible in court. Article 164 provides that the court may 
allow the reception of any evidence that may become available because 
of modern devices and techniques. Articles 24 and 40 of QSO are also 
significant. Article 24 explains when facts that are not otherwise relevant 
become relevant, while Article 40 describes how much of the 
information from the accused may be proved. Section 9(3) of the Punjab 
Act of 2007 enacts that “a person appointed in the Agency as an expert 
shall be deemed as an expert appointed under section 510 of the Code 
[of Criminal Procedure, 1898] and a person especially skilled in a 
forensic material under Article 59 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984  
(P.O. X of 1984).” This section reaffirms the admissibility of DNA 
evidence and makes the PFSA’s report regarding DNA per se admissible 

Crl. Revision No.71205/2021

in evidence.7 Parliament has enacted sections 53A, 164A and 164-B 
Cr.P.C. to specifically accord statutory recognition to the DNA test in 
respect of the offences under sections 376, 377 and 377-B PPC. 
26. 
 
The Supreme Court’s ruling in Salman Akram Raja, supra, 
is also a legal mandate for DNA testing of an accused to determine the 
authenticity of the allegations levelled against him. Under the 
Constitution, the said ruling is binding on all courts and executive 
authorities in the country. 
27. 
 
In light of the above discussion, I conclude that the DNA 
test of an accused person does not offend Article 13(b) of the 
Constitution of 1973. DNA collection in criminal cases is analogous to 
the police practice of taking photographs or collecting fingerprints of the 
accused. It accomplishes the same function more effectively. It is not 
testimonial because the investigator – or the court – draws his own 
conclusions. One cannot claim that by providing a sample for the test, 
the accused imparted any information based on his own knowledge and 
became a witness against himself, violating Article 13(b). As the U.S. 
Supreme Court held in Maryland v. King,8  an accused has a lower 
expectation of privacy. Although DNA testing may invade his privacy, 
society’s interest in identifying and prosecuting the culprit outweighs 
privacy concerns. 
28. 
 
The courts in Pakistan nonetheless disfavour DNA tests in 
civil matters. In Muhammad Nawaz v. Additional District & Sessions 
Judge, etc. (PLD 2023 SC 461), the Supreme Court stated: 
“These fundamental rights are subject to the law and can only be 
interfered with if so regulated by law … A court order for the DNA 
test of two persons as a means of identifying their genetic 
relationships interferes with their right to privacy and liberty. This test 
can be ordered only either with the consent of the persons concerned 
or without their consent if permissible under a law. We are aware of 
certain provisions of the criminal law which permit the DNA test of 
an accused person without his consent, but no civil law has been 
brought to our notice which allows this test in civil cases without the 
consent of the person concerned.”9

Now, I come to the second question of whether the court 
can order an accused’s DNA test during the trial. 
30. 
 
A careful study of the relevant provisions of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1898, and other applicable statutes discloses a 
scheme which aims at strengthening the investigator’s hands. Section 
2(i) of the Code states that “investigation includes all the proceedings 
under this Code for the collection of evidence conducted by a police 
officer or by any person (other than a Magistrate) who is authorized by a 
Magistrate in this behalf.” Similarly, sub-rule (3) of Rule 25.2 of the 
Police Rules, 1934, casts a duty on the Investigating Officer to discover 
the truth of the matter under investigation. His object should be to find 
the real facts of the case and arrest the actual offender(s). Section 94 
Cr.P.C. authorizes the Investigating Officer to produce any “document 
or thing” necessary or desirable for any investigation. 
31. 
 
The Investigating Officer must use modern techniques to 
get to the truth. In particular, he must have the accused’s DNA test done 
whenever required. However, where there is a lapse on his part, 
intentional or unintentional, the court may invoke section 94 Cr.P.C. 
read with Articles 24, 40, 59 and 164 of QSO to do justice. It may also 
draw on Rule 2 of Chapter 1-E, Volume III of the Rules & Orders of the 
Lahore High Court, which  provides: 
2. 
Duty of Court to elucidate facts.– Magistrates should 
endeavour to elucidate the facts and record the evidence in a clear and 
intelligible manner. As pointed out in 23 P.R. 1917, a Judge in a 
criminal trial is not merely a disinterested auditor of the contest 
between the prosecution and the defence, but it is his duty to elucidate 
points left in obscurity by either side, intentionally or unintentionally, 
to come to a clear understanding of the actual events that occurred 
and to remove obscurities as far as possible. The wide powers given 
to the court by Article 161 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, should be 
judiciously utilized for this purpose when necessary. 
Article 161 of QSO is reproduced below for ready reference: 
161. 
Judge’s power to put question or order production.–  
The Judge may, in order to discover or to obtain proper proof of 
relevant facts, ask any question he pleases, in any form, at any time, 
of any witness, or the parties about any fact relevant or irrelevant, and 
may order the production of any document or things and neither the 
parties nor their agents shall be entitled to make any objection to any 
such question or order, nor, without the leave of the Court, to cross-

examine any witness upon any answer given in reply to any such 
question: 
Provided that the judgment must be based upon facts declared 
by this Order to be relevant and duly proved. 
Provided also that this Article shall not authorize any Judge to 
compel any witness to answer any question or to produce any 
document which such witness would be entitled to refuse to answer or 
produce under Articles 4 to 14, both inclusive, if the question were 
asked or the document was called for by the adverse party; nor shall 
the Judge ask any question which it would be improper for any other 
person to ask under Article 143 or 144; nor shall he dispense with 
primary evidence of any document, except in the cases hereinbefore 
excepted. 
32. 
 
It is pertinent to note that section 94 Cr.P.C., in addition to 
the Investigating Officer, empowers the court to require any person to 
produce any “document or thing” necessary for the decision of the case 
it is trying. In Om Prakash Sharma v. CBI, Delhi (AIR 2000 SC 2335), 
while interpreting section 91 of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure 
1973, which is pari materia with our section 94 Cr.P.C., the Supreme 
Court of India held:  
“The powers conferred under Section 91 are enabling in nature aimed 
at arming the court or any officer in charge of the police station 
concerned to enforce and to ensure the production of any document or 
other things necessary or desirable for the purposes of any 
investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code, by 
issuing a summons or a written order to those in possession of such 
material. The language of Section 91 would, no doubt, indicate the 
width of the powers to be unlimited, but the in-built limitation 
inherent therein takes its colour and shape from the stage or point of 
time of its exercise, commensurately with the nature of proceedings as 
also the compulsions of necessity and desirability, to fulfil the task or 
achieve the object … The court concerned must be allowed a large 
latitude in the matter of exercise of discretion, and unless, in a given 
case, the court was found to have conducted itself in so demonstrably 
an unreasonable manner unbecoming of judicial authority, the court 
superior to that court cannot intervene very lightly or in a routine 
fashion to interpose or impose itself even at that stage. The reason 
being, at that stage, the question is one of the mere proprieties 
involved in the exercise of judicial discretion by the court and not of 
any rights concretised in favour of the accused   Therefore, it is to be 
only seen as to whether the trial court has judiciously and judicially 
exercised its discretion.” 
 
33. 
 
It follows that section 94 Cr.P.C. gives extensive powers to 
the court, and the effect of the word “whenever” used therein is that it 
can exercise that authority at any stage of the trial. The language of 
section 94 Cr.P.C. is general. It includes an accused person, as I have 
already discussed.

34. 
 
Section 94 Cr.P.C., Articles 24, 40, 59 and 164 of QSO and 
Rule 2 of Chapter 1-E, Volume III of the Rules & Orders of the Lahore 
High Court, must be given a purposive interpretation. In particular, the 
term “things” used in section 94 Cr.P.C. and Article 161 of QSO must be 
given a broad meaning and understood to signify anything connected 
with the offence whose production will serve the interest of justice. In 
Abdul Latif Aassi v. The State (1999 MLD 1069 : 2001 P.Cr.R. 548), 
Asif Saeed Khan Khosa J. stated that contrary to the general perception 
that we have an adversarial justice system, sections 245(1), 540, 428 and 
561-A Cr.P.C., Article 161 of QSO and Rule 2, supra, cut over that 
paradigm and allow the courts to take an inquisitorial approach in certain 
circumstances. Therefore, in a criminal case, a trial court can rectify an 
intentional or unintentional lapse on the part of the complainant, the 
Investigating Officer or the prosecuting counsel by calling in evidence 
on its own if it can have a bearing on the determination of guilt or 
innocence of the accused person. Such authority must be granted to a 
criminal court in the larger interest of the community. The stage of the 
trial is irrelevant for this purpose. The only factor important for 
exercising such power is that the evidence called is relevant. The learned 
Judge wrote: 
“Looked at in the light of these express statutory provisions, the 
argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the learned trial 
court in the present case could not assume an inquisitorial role 
appears to be misconceived. The provisions like sections 540, 428 and 
561-A, Cr.P.C. and other such provisions go a long way in further 
fortifying this conclusion. Enunciation of the law by the Honorable 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Muhammad Azam v. 
Muhammad Iqbal (PLD 1984 SC 95) also throws sufficient light on 
the subject, and I have respectfully sought guidance from the same in 
this regard.” 
35. 
 
Section 10 of the Punjab Act of 2007 authorizes the court, 
tribunal or authority to send a forensic material related to the 
investigation or proceedings before it to the PFSA for analysis and 
expert opinion. According to section 2(1)(g) of the Act, “forensic 
material” means “a document, material, equipment, impression, or any 
other object connected with the commission of an offence, a civil cause 
or any other proceedings.” This description fully covers a DNA sample.

Hence, the court may also invoke section 10, ibid, to order an accused’s 
DNA test. 
The case at hand 
36. 
 
The Deputy Prosecutor General has produced documents 
before this Court which prima facie show that the Investigating Officer 
purposely avoided the Petitioner’s DNA test. In view of what has been 
discussed above, the trial court has ample powers to get it done now. 
37. 
 
A fair trial is not solely a question for the accused. Lord 
Wheatly said: “While the law of Scotland has always very properly 
regarded fairness to an accused person as being an integral part in the 
administration of justice, fairness is not a unilateral consideration, 
fairness to the public is also a legitimate consideration … It is the 
function of the court to seek a proper balance to ensure that the rights of 
individuals are properly preserved.10 In Zahira Habibullah H. Sheikh 
and another v. State of Gujarat and others (AIR 2004 SC 3114), the 
Indian Supreme Court stated that crimes are public wrongs committed in 
violation of public rights and duties that have far-reaching implications 
for the entire community. A fair trial necessitates striking a balance 
among the interests of the accused, the victim, and society, which the 
State and prosecuting agencies represent. The interests of society should 
not be treated with disdain. It is incorrect to assert that only the accused 
must be treated fairly. That would be turning Nelson’s eyes to the needs 
of society at large and the victims,  their families and relatives. In a 
criminal trial, each of them has an inherent right to be treated equally. 
Denial of a fair trial is as much injustice to the accused as it is to the 
victim and society. 
38. 
 
The Petitioner’s contention that the Impugned Order would 
allow the prosecution to fill lacunae in its case deserves short shrift. 
Since the prosecution case is based entirely on circumstantial evidence, 
the Petitioner’s DNA test would help the court to make a correct 
decision.
