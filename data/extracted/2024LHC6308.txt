JUDGMENT 
 
 
 
Date of hearing

Petitioner by: 
 
 
Malik Javaid Akhtar Wains 
and Mr. M. Imran Shahzad 
Bhatti, learned ASC. 
 
 
Respondents No. 3(i) 
to 3(v) by: 
 
 
Mr. M. Tariq Mahmood

Sultan Tanvir Ahmad, J:–This petition 
is directed against the decisions dated 26.11.2021 and 
23.02.2022 passed by learned Civil Court and learned 
Additional District Judge, Khanewal. 
2.   
Arif Ali-deceased, now being represented 
through his legal heirs i.e. respondents No. 3(i) to 3(v) 
(the „respondents‟), filed a suit dated 06.09.2016 (the 
„suit‟). The then defendant No. 2 (Mst. Hanifan Bibi) 
passed away and as a result thereof, amended suit was 
filed on 05.04.2017 (the „amended suit‟) impleading 
defendants No. 2-A to 2-G in the array of parties.

Evidence of the parties has already been recorded. On 
18.10.2021 an application under Order VI Rule 17 of 
the Code of Civil Procedure-1908 (the „Code’) was 
filed by the respondents, with the prayer that they 
may be permitted to insert the word „declaration‟ in 
the heading as well as to allow them to make 
amendment to the effect that order dated 25.07.1995 
passed by the District Collector and the subsequent 
actions of the revenue authorities are beyond 
jurisdiction. The learned Civil Court allowed the 
application vide order dated 26.11.2021. The 
petitioner filed Civil Revision No. 26-2021 which was 
dismissed by the learned revisional Court vide 
judgment dated 23.02.2022. Being aggrieved from the 
same, the present writ petition has been instituted. 
3.   
 Malik Javaid Akhtar Wains, learned 
Advocate for the petitioner has submitted that the 
amended suit set forth by the respondents is for 
permanent injunction and the respondents remained 
silent for a period of five years but when both parties 
closed their respective evidence, the respondents with 
mala fide and in order to fill-up gaps, have filed the 
application for amendment. He has referred to the 
proposed amendments regarding raising a challenge to 
order dated 25.07.1995 of the District Collector as 
well as fard-bader and stated that it will introduce a 
new cause of action as well as the whole complexion 
of the amended suit shall be changed if the 
respondents are permitted to make the proposed 
amendments, thus, the learned Courts below have 
committed grave error. He referred to case titled “Mst. 

 
Writ Petition No. 4183-2022 
 
 
 
3 
Imam Hussain versus Sher Ali Shah and others” 
(1994 SCMR 2293) and stated that belated attempt of 
the plaintiff to amend the plaint is not warranted. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon 
case titled “Mst. Noor Khatoon through Legal Heirs 
and another versus Muhammad Shafi” (2003 SCMR 
542) and stated that introduction of new facts and 
setting-up different plea in conflict to the pleadings, 
changing the character of any suit, could not be 
allowed. The learned counsel has further relied upon 
cases titled “Atlantic Steamer’s Supply Company 
versus M. V. Titisee and others” (PLD 1993 Supreme 
Court 88) and “Ghulam Haider versus Muhammad 
Ayub” (2001 SCMR 133). 
4.   
 Mr. M. Tariq Mahmood Dogar, learned 
Advocate for the respondents has stated that the 
provisions of Order VI Rule 17 of the Code are 
required to be construed broadly and such power 
should be exercised liberally; otherwise, it can 
jeopardize the interest of the parties involved in the 
case; that the special circumstances of the case 
required exercising the discretion and the learned two 
Courts below have not made any mistake in using the 
discretion keeping in view the principle settled by this 
Court in case titled “Faisalabad Electric Supply 
Company Limited versus Munir Ahmad Ranjha and 
others” (2020 CLC 68). He has made reference to the 
guidelines in the said case and stated that the 
amendments which do not cause injustice to the other 
side and when they are necessary to determine the real 
question in controversy should normally be allowed. 

 
Writ Petition No. 4183-2022

Mr. Dogar has argued that no new cause of action is 
being introduced through the proposed amendments. 
He has further relied upon cases titled “Iftikhar 
Ahmad versus Muhammad Anwar and others” (2024 
CLC 1735) and “Gulzar Ahmad versus Additional 
District Judge and others” (2019 CLC 1432). 
5.   
 I have heard the learned counsel for the 
parties in detail on questions whether the amendments 
sought in the plaint, in facts and the circumstances of 
the present case, ought to have been allowed or not. 
6.   
 Order VI Rule 17 of the Code provides 
that the Court may at any stage of the proceedings 
allow either party to alter or amend his pleadings in 
such manner and on such terms as may be just, and all 
such amendments shall be made as may be necessary 
for the purpose of determining the real questions in 
controversy between the parties. The Supreme Court 
in case titled “Mst. Ghulam Bibi and others versus 
Sarsa Khan and others” (PLD 1985 Supreme Court 
345) observed that this rule can be divided into two 
parts. In the cases falling under the first part, the 
Court has discretion but under the second part i.e. 
when the amendment is necessary for the purpose of 
determining the real question, it becomes the duty of 
the Court to permit the amendment, however, subject 
to an important condition that the nature of the suit is 
not changed by amendment. In Mst. Ghulam Bibi case 
(supra), the Supreme Court of Pakistan was dealing 
with a matter where the heading of the plaint was 
sought to be amended to specific performance from 
the declaration. Such change in heading had similar 

 
Writ Petition No. 4183-2022 
 
 
 
5 
effect to the prayer clause. The Honourable Supreme 
Court allowed the application. The principle settled in 
this case was then followed in several cases by the 
Supreme Court and the High Courts of Pakistan.  
7.  
In case titled “Mst. Zubaida Bibi versus Mst. 
Hashmat Bibi and 2 others” (1993 SCMR 1882), the 
Supreme Court has held as under:- 
“4. On behalf of the appellant an 
application has been moved before us that 
she should be permitted to amend the 
plaint so as to seek the relief of specific 
performance 
of 
the 
agreement 
of 
22.5.1978. In support of her application 
reliance has been placed on the judgment 
of this Court in the case of Ghulam Bibi v. 
Sarsa Khan (PLD 1985 SC 345). After 
hearing the learned counsel we find that 
the appellant is seeking this new relief 
entirely on the basis of the assertions 
already made in the plaint and thus the 
amendment will not change the nature of 
the suit. In the circumstances we allow the 
prayer for amendment. Accordingly, we 
accept the appeal, set aside the judgments 
of the courts below and remand the suit to 
the trial Court for a fresh decision. The 
costs in this appeal will abide by the final 
event.”  
(Underlining is added) 
Learned Peshawar High Court in “Nizam Ullah versus 
Mst. Gohar Taja and others” (2003 YLR 2008) 
permitted amendment in plaint when found that the 
prayer clause for specific performance of contract was 
essential and sought amendment was not motivated by 
any mala fide. The relevant paragraph reads as under:- 
“5. It is by now well-settled that 
amendment in pleadings cannot be refused 
if this is emanating from the facts 
mentioned in the plaint especially when it 

 
Writ Petition No. 4183-2022 
 
 
 
6 
does not tend to change the cause of 
action. No doubt the petitioner primarily 
instituted a suit for declaration but later 
on when he came to know that the form 
of suit was not proper and that prayer for 
specific performance of contract was 
essential for its success, he accordingly 
made an application for amendment in 
plaint which could not have been refused 
by the Courts below particularly when 
there was nothing on the record to show 
that it was motivated by any mala fide and 
that when it emanated from the same 
bundle of facts narrated in the plaint 
constituting the cause of action in the 
suit…”  
(Emphasis supplied) 
8.   
 A learned Division Bench of the Peshawar 
High Court in case titled “Muhammad Zaman versus 
Siraj-ul-Islam and 11 others” (2013 YLR 1548) has 
observed that the word “alter” used in the above rule 
gives a bit wider power than the word “amendment”, 
if Court comes to the conclusion that the same is 
necessary to do the complete and substantial justice. I 
would like to reproduce the following extract from the 
said judgment:- 
“A suit for specific performance can be 
changed into a suit for declaration and 
vice 
versa. 
Similarly 
a 
relief 
for 
declaration can be added in a suit for 
permanent injunction and all such changes 
would not change nature of the suit. The 
word "alter" used in the rule gives it a bit 
wider aspect than word amendment. If a 
Court comes to the conclusion that 
amendment 
in 
the 
pleadings 
was 
necessary to do the complete and 
substantial justice between the parties, 
then it can make an order in this regard 
to achieve the end of justice and to 
prevent the abuse of process of Court. The 

 
Writ Petition No. 4183-2022 
 
 
 
7 
landmark judgments of the Apex Court in 
the case of Mst. Ghulam Bibi and others 
v. Sarsa Khan and others (PLD 1985 
Supreme Court 345) can be referred in this 
regard.”  
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
This Court in Iftikhar Ahmad case (supra) has 
recently considered the aspect of delay in applying for 
amendment while keeping in view the wording of the 
rule which provides that amendment can be made “at 
any stage of the proceedings”. This Court has reached 
to the decision that the amendment can be permitted 
even in appeal or revisional jurisdiction, when it is 
just. The relevant part reads:- 
“…Moreover amendment can be allowed 
while ignoring delay whatsoever, even at 
any stage of proceedings in the trial, and 
in certain cases amendments can be 
permitted at the stage of appeal or even in 
the 
revisional 
jurisdiction, 
however, 
keeping in view the beneficial rule, that 
proposed amendment is expedient for the 
purpose of determining the real questions 
in controversy between the parties and it is 
not changing the nature of pleadings. An 
alteration in the relief does not ordinarily 
change the character or substance of the 
suit if it is based on the same averments, 
and if such an amendment is allowed, no 
injustice could be done to the other party. 
It is also well-established tenet that 
pursuant to Order VI, Rule 17, C.P.C., 
amendments to pleadings are permissible 
at any juncture of the legal proceedings, 
provided they serve to crystallize the 
substantive 
issues 
at 
hand 
without 
transmuting the fundamental character of 
the original pleadings. Reliance is placed 
on 
Muhammad 
Saleem 
Naseem 
v. 
Additional District Judge, Dunyapur and 
12 others (2021 CLC 87) and Ahmed 
Bakhsh v. Imam Bakhsh and others (2023 

 
Writ Petition No. 4183-2022 
 
 
 
8 
CLC 1076).” 
9.   
 The Supreme Court of Pakistan has also 
discussed and concluded that amendment should be 
liberally allowed provided that the same does not 
cause injury to the other side. The provisions are 
intended to secure the proper administration of justice 
and to serve this purpose full power of amendment 
must be enjoyed; nonetheless, no power has been 
given to the Courts to enable the parties to set up one 
distinct cause of action to be substituted for another or 
to change the subject matter of the suit. Reference is 
made to case titled “Syed Akhlaque Hussain and 
another versus Water and Power Development 
Authority, Lahore” (1977 SCMR 284). 
10.   
 The question of limitation can also be an 
important factor, when necessitated by facts of the case, 
while dealing with the application of amendment. 
When legal rights have accrued to the other side by 
elapse of time the power to amend pleadings should 
not be exercised as a rule. I would like to refer to case 
titled “L. J. Leach and Co. Ltd. and another versus 
Messrs. Jardine Skinner and Co.” (S) A. I. R. 1957 S. 
C. 357, where the following has been observed:-  
“(16) It is no doubt true that Courts 
would, as a rule, decline to allow 
amendments, if a fresh suit on the amended 
claim would be barred by limitation on the 
date of the application. But that is a factor 
to be taken into account in exercise of the 
discretion as to whether amendment 
should be ordered, and does not affect the 
power of the Court to order it, if that is 
required in the interests of justice. In 
Charan Das v. Amir Khan, 47 Ind App 255 
(AIR 1921 PC 50) (A) the Privy Council 

 
Writ Petition No. 4183-2022 
 
 
 
9 
observed : 
 "That there was full power to 
make the amendment cannot be 
disputed, and though such a power 
should not as a rule be exercised 
where the effect is to take away 
from a defendant a legal right 
which has accrued to him by lapse 
of time, yet there are cases where 
such 
considerations 
are 
out-
weighed 
by 
the 
special 
circumstances of the case…"  
 
11.   
 The main endeavour of the learned counsel 
for the petitioner is that permitting to convert the 
amended suit from injunction to declaration or 
allowing the respondents to seek declaration along 
with injunction would amount to changing the nature 
of the suit. However, I have observed that the suit, 
originally filed on 06.09.2016, was for declaration 
along with seeking relief of permanent injunction etc. 
When one of the defendants passed away, permission 
was granted to make the corresponding amendment 
but somehow the word “declaration” in the heading 
was left to be included. Learned counsel for the 
petitioner when confronted with this position, he 
stated that for about half a decade the plaintiff 
remained silent and the proceedings took place in 
pursuance thereof and evidence was recorded, which 
reflects mala fide on the part of the plaintiff. To me 
this mistake does not appear to be merely on the part 
of the plaintiff. Not just litigants in dispute and their 
pleaders should have remained vigilant but it was also 
for the Courts to see that it is not permissible by law to 
make any amendment at own and without leave of the 
Court. This went unnoticed by all, therefore, I am not 

 
Writ Petition No. 4183-2022 
 
 
 
10 
in agreement with Mr. Wains as to this allegation of 
mala fide. In the cases titled “Dausa and others versus 
Province of the Punjab and others” (2016 SCMR 
1621) and “Nazir Ahmad and another versus Sarfraz 
Ali and 2 others” (PLD 2013 Lahore 309), it has 
been observed that for dispensation of complete 
justice the Court should not hesitate in allowing the 
amendment to cure the formal defect. The permission 
to cure the formal defect should be allowed liberally 
to promote the fair adjudication. Paragraph No. 10 of 
the Nazir Ahmad case (supra) is as under:- 
“10. The power to grant amendment, being 
procedural is to be used for the purpose of 
dispensation of complete justice and the 
Court may not hesitate in allowing the 
amendment to cure the formal defects, 
which is bona fide and has been occurred 
due to mistake of fact or misapprehension. 
The case-law relied upon by the learned 
counsel for the petitioners is fully 
applicable to the facts and circumstances 
of the present case. In my considered 
opinion 
to 
do 
substantial 
justice 
amendment is necessary for the purpose of 
determining 
the 
real 
matter 
in 
controversy.” 
  
The relevant part of Dausa and others case 
(supra) reads:- 
“…The amendment application (C.M.A. 
No.3811-L of 2006) by the appellants/ 
plaintiffs for incorporating the correct date 
of the mortgage in the plaint does not alter 
the nature of the case pleaded by the 
plaintiffs. The prayer for the incorporation 
of an undisputed fact is of a formal nature 
and brings factual clarity which promotes 
the fair adjudication of the controversy and 
the interest of justice. Compliance with the 
said criteria satisfies the principles for 

 
Writ Petition No. 4183-2022 
 
 
 
11 
allowing amendment in pleadings even by 
the highest Court. [Ref. Ghulam Nabi v. 
Nazir Ahmad (1985 SCMR 824); Secretary 
to Government (West Pakistan) v. Abdul 
Kafil (PLD 1978 SC 264)]. The C.M.A. No. 
3811-L of 2006 for the amendment prayed is 
accordingly allowed.” 
12.   
 After analyzing various decisions on the 
subject including the above referred judgments some 
important factors, which are only illustrative and not 
exhaustive, that can be kept in my mind while dealing 
with the application for amendment are (i) the 
intention of the applicant seeking to amend pleadings; 
(ii) the question of limitation if applicable; (iii) refusal 
or acceptance of amendment should not lead to 
injustice or injury to opponent side; (iv) efforts should 
be made to avoid multiplicity of litigation; (v) the 
nature of the suit and cause of action originally set-up 
and (vi) if the amendment is necessary for the purpose 
of determination of the real question in controversy 
between the parties provided subject matter of suit 
remains unchanged.   
13.   
 The plaintiff is essentially seeking relief 
that as per mutation No. 1005 dated 31.12.1996, he is 
the owner of the disputed property and the earlier 
round of litigation initiated in the year 1970 which 
was decree on 31.10.1978, is not being observed by 
the revenue authorities. Besides the amendment as to 
addition of word „declaration‟ in the heading of the 
amended suit which is already dealt with in detail, the 
sought amendments relate to those orders or 
proceedings of the revenue which are allegedly in 
defiance of the decree dated 31.10.1978. This hardly 
has any bearing on the subject matter or the nature of 

 
Writ Petition No. 4183-2022 
 
 
 
12 
the plaint.  
14.   
 For the aforesaid reasons, I am of the view 
that the learned two Courts below have not erred in 
accepting the application for amendment in the plaint. 
Accordingly the judgment and the order of the learned 
two Courts below are upheld. Considering the facts 
and circumstances of this case, the learned trial Court 
to dispose of the case within the earliest possible time 
and preferably within six months from the date of 
communication of this judgment. Observations made 
above shall not prejudice the remaining steps towards 
the conclusion of trial or final outcome. There is no 
order as to costs.
