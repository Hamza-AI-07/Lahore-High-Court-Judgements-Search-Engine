Mr. Iftikhar Majid, Advocate for respondent.  
 
Following questions of law are proposed, statedly 
arisen out of order dated 28.07.2025, passed by the 
Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue Multan Bench 
(Tribunal): 
i) 
Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of 
the case, the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue 
erred in holding that the Certified Emission 
Reduction certificates fall  within the meaning of 
‘goods’ as defined in Section 2(12) of the Sales Tax 
Act, 1990 and are therefore subject to sales tax 
under the Sales Tax Act, 1990 ? 
 
ii) 
Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of 
the case, the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue 
erred in law by failing to appreciate that the 
consideration received from outside Pakistan by the 
Applicant, arising from the sale of Certified 
Emission Reduction certificates in international 
emissions trading markets, was not subject to sales 
tax under the Sales Tax Act, 1990?” 
 
2. 
Heard. Undisputedly, no provision of Sales Tax Act 
1990 (‘Act’) explicitly or specifically defines Certified 
Emission Reduction certificates (Carbon credits) as 
taxable supplies; and attempt to bring those within the 
ambit of definition of ‘goods’ [in terms of section 2(12) 
of the Act] tantamount to rewrite the scope of charging 
provision [section 3 of the Act]. Learned counsel for 

STR No.64/2025

respondent fails to explain that how trading or sale of 
Carbon credits, outside Pakistan, could be construed as 
taxable supply, made in furtherance of taxable activity – 
merely classifying Carbon credits as goods is not enough 
to otherwise bring transaction within the ambit of sales 
tax regime. Carbon credits are, at best, construable as 
entitlement accrued in lieu of efforts made for reducing 
carbon emissions. Commissioner (Appeals) annulled 
claim raised against Carbon credits – which erred to an 
extent by treating them as securities but ultimate order 
of annulment of liability is nevertheless correct and 
warrants no interference – and Tribunal erred by 
treating them as goods [though acknowledging them as 
intangible(s). 
3. 
Questions proposed are answered in affirmative 
and reference application is decided in favour of 
applicant and decision of the Tribunal and order in 
original are annulled.  
4. 
Office to send copy of this order to the Appellate 
Tribunal under the seal of the Court for information.
