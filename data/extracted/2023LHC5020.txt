290, 291, 302, 324, 353, 395, 427, 436, 452, 505 of the

protest took place on the arrest of Imran Khan in connection 
with the Al-Qadar Trust case on 09.05.2023 at 11:50 p.m. 
The complainant alleged that the protestors turned violent 
and attacked different public and private premises. In the 
said incident, one person engulfed in flames in the Askari 
Tower, lost his life, who was later identified as Hamza 
Imran, stated to be a worker of P.T.I. Admittedly, the

The complainant has not specifically named the witnesses 
who disclosed the petitioner's name and role during the 
protest before him. Asad Shahzad, S.I, Waseem Iqbal S.I, 
Asif Iqbal A.S.I, Ehsan Ullah 16360/C, and Muhammad 
Waseem 6660/C, prosecution witnesses, in their statements 
under Section 161 Cr.P.C. did not state a single word that 
they informed to the complainant about the involvement of 
the petitioner in the instant case. Instead, the statements of 
these witnesses were verbatim of the statement of the 
complainant under section 161 of Cr.P.C. regarding the role 
of the petitioner. During the investigation, statements under 
section 161 of Cr.P.C. of Muhammad Boota son of Abdul 
Aziz, Gulsher son of Laal Badshah, and Muhammad Islam 
son of Muhammad Suleman, security guards of Askari 
Tower, were recorded. They had not stated that the 
petitioner was among one of the protestors who set Askari 
Tower on fire or she was leading the protest. Admittedly, 
the petitioner has not entered the Askari Tower premises, 
nor is it the case of the prosecution that she set on fire 
Askari Tower. However, as mentioned above, the role of 
raising slogans was attributed by the complainant to the 
other accused, who were named in the FIR.

During the investigation, on 13.06.2023, Muhammad

Operator, 
C.R.O 
investigation, 
produced U.S.B and six pages of script before the 
investigation officer, who took the same into possession. On 
14.06.2023, the petitioner was joined in the investigation, 
and on 19.06.2023, the request for her physical remand was 
turned down by the trial court. After that, on 06.09.2023, 
offenses under sections 107, 120, 121, 121-A, 131, 146, 
153-A, and 153-B PPC were added, and physical remand 
was allowed by the trial court on 09.09.2023. On 
11.09.2023, Muhammad Mubashar 27626/C, Operator 
C.R.O. (Inv), also produced two U.S.Bs and eight pages of 
script before the investigating officer, who took the same 
into possession. On 16.06.2023, Sr. Superintendent of 
Police Investigation, Lahore, through letter No.592/05-SSP-
Inv, sent the audio/video transcripts of the petitioner in USB 
and written form to the Additional Director Operations, 
Cyber Crime Islamabad, for verification of the social media 
account (Instagram) of the accused petitioner, and whether 
the videos were uploaded from her account or same are 
fake. The request for CCTV potages made to Safe City 
Lahore is also available. However, the reports are not 
available.  
5. 
As far as the contention of learned Additional 
Prosecutor Generals that the petitioner, alongwith others, 
enticed and motivated the general public against the 
Pakistan Army, State Institutions, and anti-state activities, 
leading to a devastating impact on the country, is 
concerned, the reports whether she made such tweets and 
same were uploaded from her social media accounts or not 
is still awaited. She admitted that one controversial tweet 
was uploaded which was subsequently deleted through her 

Crl.Misc. No.64830-B/2023 
5
Twitter message. She tweeted and deleted it by admitting 
her wrongdoing. The petitioner, in her other Tweet after 
deleting the objectionable tweet, tendered apology through 
her tweet. The state is like a mother; one should be given a 
chance if she/he commits a mistake and apologizes. In these 
circumstances, prima facie prosecution case against the 
petitioner falls under the ambit of further inquiry into her 
guilt under Section 497(2), Cr.P.C. The learned law officer 
submitted that the prosecution case against the petitioner is 
of vicarious liability. In this regard, it is relevant to mention 
here that the learned trial court would see the vicarious 
liability of the petitioner after recording the parties’ 
evidence.  
6. 
For the reasons supra, we hold that the case against 
the petitioner is of further inquiry as contemplated under 
Section 497 (2) of Cr.P.C. Therefore, this petition is 
accepted, and the petitioner is admitted to post-arrest bail 
subject to her furnishing bail bonds in the sum of 
Rs.5,00,000/- with two sureties in the like amount to the 
satisfaction of the trial court.
