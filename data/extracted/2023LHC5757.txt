Raheel Kamran J:- This civil revision 
under Section 115 of CPC is of the defendant who has 
challenged the order dated 11.07.2023 passed by the 
Additional District Judge, Lahore whereby his application 
under Rule 4 of Order XXXVII CPC for setting aside ex-parte 
judgment and decree dated 02.11.2022 was dismissed.  
2. 
The facts giving rise to this revision are that the 
respondent instituted a suit for recovery of an amount of 
532515/- US Dollars under Order XXXVII CPC against the 
petitioner who did not appear before the Court, hence, was 
proceeded against ex-parte.  The trial Court after recording ex-
parte evidence of the plaintiff/respondent, decreed the suit 
vide ex-parte judgment and decree dated 02.11.2022.  The 
plaintiff/respondent filed execution petition whereupon the 
petitioner/defendant moved an application under Rule 4 of 
Order XXXVII CPC, which was dismissed vide order 
impugned herein.

3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner while referring to the 
summons issued in the instant case on the address specified 
therein i.e. House No.75, Street No.26, Block-X, Phase-III, 
DHA Lahore, contends that neither any such address exists 
nor does the petitioner reside there.  He maintains that there is 
no signature or thumb impression of the petitioner on the 
service report submitted by the process server.  He adds that it 
has erroneously been assumed that the petitioner was properly 
served, hence, the impugned order is unsustainable in law.  In 
support of his contentions, learned counsel for the petitioner 
has relied on the cases of Abdul Rehman Wahla vs. Dr. Sher 
Dil Batra (PLD 1986 Supreme Court 234), Amar Jeet Singh 
vs. Sant Singh (2022 CLC Lahore 6) and Shahzad Akhtar vs. 
Farukh Jameel (2023 MLD Lahore 1118). 
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent while 
referring to the report of process server contends that a copy of 
notice was served on the petitioner and another copy of the 
same was affixed on conspicuous part of his house, therefore, 
he was duly served on 16.07.2022.  He maintains that the 
petitioner was also served through Pakistan Post and TCS and 
postal receipts are available on record.  He further contends 
that notice was also published in the newspaper daily ‘Dunya’ 
on 03.07.2022 which specified both addresses of the petitioner 
and such service in terms of the afore-mentioned rule is to be 
treated as effective as he has been served personally.  In 
support of such plea he has placed reliance on the cases of 
Cotton Export Corporation of Pakistan (Pvt.) Limited vs. M/s. 
Saleem Rehman, Model Cotton Ginning & Pressing Factory 
(Pvt.) Limited and others (1994 CLC 308) and United Bank 
Ltd. vs. Noor Textile Mills Limited and 7 others (PLD 1995 
Karachi 162).  He finally contends that ex-parte judgment 
and decree was passed on 02.11.2022 whereas application for 
setting aside the same was filed on 14.12.2022 i.e. after 41 

3 
Civil Revision No.60871 of 2023 
days, however, limitation for filing such application is 30 
days.  Reliance in that regard has been placed on the case of 
Shahid Pervaiz alias Shahid Hameed vs. Muhammad Ahmad 
Ameen (2006 SCMR 631). 
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.   
6. 
It is case of the petitioner that he was not properly 
served in the suit.   Record reflects that the suit under Order 
XXXVII CPC was instituted on 25.05.2022 on which the 
summons was ordered to be issued to the defendant/petitioner 
for 14.06.2022.  On the said date it was observed that service 
upon the defendant was effected, however, summons was 
again ordered to be issued along with affixation at 
conspicuous place/address of the defendant.   Copies of both 
the summonses are available on record and though it has been 
stated in the report of the process server that the defendant had 
received the same yet his signatures were not obtained in 
acknowledgement of their receipt.  Rule 16 of Order V CPC 
requires the serving officer/process server to obtain signature 
of the defendant while delivering him a copy of the summons 
personally.  The said rule is reproduced hereunder: - 
 
“16.   Persons served to sign acknowledgement.- Where the 
serving officer delivers or tenders a copy of the summons to 
the defendant personally, or to an agent or other person on 
his behalf, he shall require the signature of the person to 
whom the copy is so delivered or tendered to an 
acknowledgement of service endorsed on the original 
summons.”   
 
The afore-mentioned requirement of law has not been properly 
adhered to in the instant case inasmuch as signatures or thumb 
impressions of the petitioner have not been apparently 
obtained in acknowledgement of receipt of the summonses nor 
is it stated in the reports of process server that signatures of 
the petitioner were required upon delivery of the summonses 
in acknowledgement of service endorsed on the original 
summonses.

Civil Revision No.60871 of 2023 
7. 
Moreover, report of process server on the summons 
issued to defendant for 18.07.2022 does not reveal that on 
which part of the house or address of the defendant the copy 
of summons was affixed.  Although the Court is not obligated 
to order for affixation of summons yet as observed above, the 
trial Court in this case after perusing the report on the 
summons issued for 14.06.2022, probably being dissatisfied, 
had again ordered for issuance of summons along with 
affixation.  Rule 17 of Order V CPC provides the manner in 
which the affixation is to be made.  Said rule is reproduced 
herein below for ready reference: - 
 
“17.   Procedure when defendant refuses to accept service, 
or cannot be found.-- Whether the defendant or his agent 
or such other person as aforesaid refuses to sign the 
acknowledgment, or where the serving officer, after using 
all due and reasonable diligence, cannot find the defendant, 
and there is no agent empowered to accept service of the 
summons on his behalf, nor any other person on whom 
service can be made, the serving officer shall affix a copy of 
the summons on the outer door or some other conspicuous 
part of the house in which the defendant ordinarily resides 
or carries on business or personally works for gain, and 
shall then return the original to the Court from which it was 
issued, with a report endorsed thereon or annexed thereto 
stating that he has so affixed the copy, the circumstances 
under which he did so, and the name and address of the 
person (if any) by whom the house was identified and in 
whose presence the copy was affixed.”     
 
In this case, necessary pre-conditions for invoking such rule 
i.e. refusal of the petitioner or his agent to sign the 
acknowledgement or failure of the process server to find the 
petitioner after using all due and reasonable diligence are 
clearly missing, therefore, procedure adopted by the process 
server is clearly not under the said rule.  Even otherwise a 
copy of the summons is not specified to have been affixed on 
the door or some conspicuous part of premises of the 
petitioner to satisfy requirement of said rule.

Civil Revision No.60871 of 2023 
8. 
There is yet another aspect of the matter which requires 
consideration.  Rule 8, Part B, Chapter 7, Volume IV, of the 
Rules and Orders of the Lahore High Court, Lahore requires 
that in case of sending a judicial notice for publication in a 
newspaper, the manager of the newspaper should send the 
copy of the paper containing the notice, under postal 
certificate, to the party for whose perusal it is intended at the 
address given in the notice.  The said rule reads as follows: - 
 
“8. Publication to be arrange through Publication 
Information Bureau.—In sending a judicial notice for 
publication in a newspaper, the Court should, in the 
covering letter, require the manager of the newspaper to 
send, under postal certificate, the copy of the paper 
containing the notice to the party for whose perusal it is 
intended at the address given in the notice, marking the 
notice in question with red ink; he should also be required, 
as proof of compliance with this order, to attach the postal 
certificate to his bill when submitting the letter to the Court 
of payment.” 
 
It is manifest from the above rule that publication in the 
newspaper is not sufficient in the absence of sending a copy of 
the paper to the party concerned and there is nothing available 
on record to establish such compliance.  Additionally, no 
further inquiry in the matter was carried out under Rule 19 of 
Order V CPC facilitating examination of the serving officer.  
In the attending circumstances, service of the defendant/ 
petitioner shown to be effected in the proceedings of the suit 
does not seem to be proper and in accordance with the law on 
the subject. 
9. 
Insofar as the argument of learned counsel for the 
respondent that application for setting aside ex-parte 
proceedings was filed beyond the period of limitation i.e. 30 
days provided in the First Schedule to the Limitation Act, 
1908 is concerned, the same is misconceived as the said period 
is to run from the date of knowledge of the decree as summons 
in this case, as observed supra, was not duly served.  In the 

6 
Civil Revision No.60871 of 2023 
instant case, the petitioner claims to have acquired knowledge 
of the ex-parte decree on 08.12.2022 when he received notice 
in the execution proceedings.  The case of Shahid Pervaiz 
alias Shahid Hameed (supra) relied upon by the respondent’s 
counsel is quite distinguishable on facts, as in the said case the 
defendant after appearance had disappeared whereas in this 
case the defendant has claimed unawareness for not having 
been properly served. 
10. 
For the foregoing reasons, this civil revision is allowed 
and the impugned order dated 11.07.2023 is set aside.  
Resultantly, the application for setting aside ex-parte 
judgment and decree stands accepted, the ex-parte judgment & 
decree dated 02.11.2022 stands set aside and the District Court 
is directed to decide the petitioner’s application for leave to 
appear and defend the suit instituted by the respondent within 
one month from the receipt of copy of this Order, without 
granting any unnecessary adjournment to either side.  There 
shall be no order as to costs.
