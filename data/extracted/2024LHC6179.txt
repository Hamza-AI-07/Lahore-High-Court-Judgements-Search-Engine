Ms. Samina Qureshi, Advocate for the applicants. 
             Through this review application the applicants seek review of 
the order dated 09.05.2024 passed by this Court in the titled Intra Court 
Appeal No.57 of 2024 whereby the said Intra Court appeal was

Judge in Chambers whereby the petition filed by the applicants under 
Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
bearing Writ Petition No.3214 of 2024,was dismissed was upheld.  
2.    The brief facts, necessary for the disposal of the instant review

and amongst others, the applicants qualified for the subject matter posts 
and through letters dated 02.01.2023, Job Offer Letters were issued for 
the said posts however in terms of Clause 5 of the Job Offer Letters, 
upon the completion of the initial contract period of one year, the 
contracts of the applicants were accordingly, not extended and the 
applicants filed the Writ Petition No.3214 of 2024 under Article 199 of 
the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 assailing the 
said termination of their contracts, however, the learned Single Judge 
in Chambers vide the order dated 03.05.2024 dismissed the petition as 
filed by the applicants. The applicants preferred the Intra Court Appeal 
No.57 of 2024  assailing the order passed by the learned Single Judge 
in Chambers ,however the learned Division Bench of this Court 
dismissed the said Intra Court Appeal No.57 of 2024 vide order dated 
09.05.2024. Now the applicants have filed the instant Review 
Application. 
3.      Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the applicants stated that 
the order under review of the learned appellate Court suffers from 
certain errors of law which are apparent on the face of the record and 
the learned Division Bench of this Court in order under review did not 
consider the questions of payment of the dues to the applicants for the 
work done by them during their employment and that if there was any 
irregularity in the appointment process of the applicants, then the 
applicants could not have been faulted for that error, hence necessitating 
the review of the order dated 09.05.2024 passed by  the learned Division 
Bench of this Court.

4.      We have heard learned counsel for the applicants and perused the 
record carefully.  
5.       Power of review is provided under section 114 and Order XLVII, 
Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Under section 114, C.P.C. 
a review application is maintainable for enabling the Court to correct 
the errors. The main aim of the power of review is to prevent injustice 
from being done by a Court and is subject to the limitation provided in 
clauses (a), (b) and (c) of sub-rule (1) of Order XLVII, C.P.C. For the 
purpose of appreciation, both provisions are being reproduced as 
under:-  
 
‘Section 114-Review (1) Subject as aforesaid, any person considering himself 
aggrieved--  
 
(a) by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed by this Code, but from 
which no appeal has been preferred.  
 
(b) by a decree or order from which no appeal is allowed by this Code, or  
 
(c) by a decision on a reference from a Court of Small Causes, may apply for 
a review of judgment to the Court which passed the decree or made the order, 
and the Court may make such order thereon as it thinks fit.  
 
(2) Nothing contained in sub-section (1) shall apply to a review of any 
judgment pronounced or order made by the Supreme Court."  
“Order XLVII, Rule 1-Review-Application for review of judgment  
(1) Any person considering himself aggrieved---  
(a) by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed by this Code, but from 
which no appeal has been preferred,  

4 
Review Application No.07 of 2024 
 
        In 
Intra Court Appeal No. 57 of 2024 
 
 
(b) by a decree or order from which no appeal is allowed by this Code, or  
(c) by a decision on a reference from a Court of Small Causes, and who, from the 
discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of 
due diligence, was not within his knowledge or could not be produced by him 
at the time when the decree was passed or order made, or on account of some 
mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or for any other sufficient 
reason, desires to obtain a review of the decree passed or order made against 
him, may apply for a review of judgment to the Court which passed the decree 
or made the order.  
(2)  A party who is not appealing from a decree or order may apply for a review of 
judgment notwithstanding the pendency of an appeal by some other party 
except where the ground of such appeal is common to the applicant and the 
appellant, or when, being respondent he can present to the Appellate Court the 
case on which he applies for the review."  
From the combined analysis of the above referred provisions of law, it 
becomes crystal clear that the power of review can only be exercised 
when an error or mistake is manifestly shown to float on the surface of 
the record, which is so patent that if allowed to remain intact, would 
perpetuate illegality and gross injustice. Viewed in the background of 
the aforesaid principles governing the filing of a review application, 
when we consider the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for 
the applicants and the points urged in the review application, it appears 
that all the points were already raised and discussed in the under review 
decision of the Intra Court Appeal. Each point raised was exhaustively 
considered, analyzed and dealt with by the learned Division Bench. A 
perusal of the order under review passed by the learned Division Bench 
reveals that it did  consider the questions of payment of the dues to the 

5 
Review Application No.07 of 2024 
 
        In 
Intra Court Appeal No. 57 of 2024 
 
 
applicants for the work done by them during their employment and that 
if there was any irregularity in the appointment process of the 
applicants, then the applicants could not have been faulted for that error 
and made a specific observations as under :- 
“Being contractual employees, the relationship between the appellants and 
respondents will be governed by the principle of master and servant and the 
appellants have to serve till the satisfaction of their master. Hence, in view of 
the established principle of law that a contract employee is debarred from 
approaching this Court in its jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution 
of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 for reinstatement or extension of a 
contract and the only remedy available to a contract employee is to file suit for 
damages alleging any breach of contract or failure to extend the contract, this 
Court cannot force the employer to reinstate or extend the contract of the 
employees, even in case of any wrongful termination.” 
Categorical findings, recorded after careful and conscious appreciation 
of all the facts and applicable law cannot be regenerated with a view to 
re-evaluating the same and taking a contrary view, which otherwise did 
not suffer from misconstruction or misreading. It is a settled proposition 
of law that the points already raised and considered cannot be re-
agitated in review jurisdiction. Reliance is placed upon the case of Sh. 
Mehdi Hassan v. Province of Punjab through Member, Board of 
Revenue and 5 others (2007 SCMR 755) wherein it has been observed 
as under:-  
 
"8. We having heard the learned counsel for the parties at length and perused 
the record with their assistance have found that the contentions raised by the 
learned counsel in support of this petition have been exhaustively dealt with in 

6 
Review Application No.07 of 2024 
 
        In 
Intra Court Appeal No. 57 of 2024 
 
 
the judgment under review. This is settled law that the points already raised 
and considered before the Court, cannot be re-agitated in review jurisdiction 
which is confined to the extent of patent error or a mistake floating on the face 
of record which if not corrected may perpetuate illegality and injustice. The 
mere fact that another view of the matter was possible or the conclusion drawn 
in the judgment was wrong, would not be a valid ground to review the judgment 
unless it is shown that the Court has failed to consider an important question 
of law. The learned counsel has not been able to point out any such error of 
law in the judgment or interference in the review jurisdiction."  
The scope of review is very limited. A judgment can be reviewed only 
when the error is apparent on the face of the record and that it must be 
so manifest, so clear, that no Court could permit such an error to remain 
on record. Reliance in this regard  is placed on the case of Mehmood 
Hussain Lark and others v. Muslim Commercial Bank Limited and 
others (2010 SCMR 1036) wherein it has been observed as under:-  
 
"We have given due consideration to the arguments advanced by the petitioners 
in person, gone through the judgment sought to be reviewed. We are of the 
view that before an error can be a ground of review, it is necessary, that it must 
be one which is apparent on the face of the record and that it must be so 
manifest, so clear, that no Court could permit such an error to remain on record. 
Incorrectness of a conclusion arrived at after a conscious perusal of record and 
in depth examination of evidence cannot be made a ground for review because 
to permit a review on the ground of incorrectness would amount to granting 
the Court jurisdiction of re-hearing appeals against its own judgment."  
In the case of Syed Wajihul Hassan Zaidi v. Government of the Punjab 
and others (PLD 2004 SC 801), it was held:---  
 
"Every judgment pronounced by Supreme Court is presumed to be final, 

7 
Review Application No.07 of 2024 
 
        In 
Intra Court Appeal No. 57 of 2024 
 
 
solemn and well considered covering all points arising out of the case. If the 
Court has taken a conscious and deliberate decision on a point of fact or law, 
a review petition will not be competent. The circumstance that the view 
canvassed in the review petition is more reasonable than the view already 
accepted by the Court in the impugned order of which review is sought would 
not be sufficient to maintain a review petition. Likewise, factum that a material 
irregularity was committed by the Court would not be adequate enough to 
warrant a review of the judgment unless the material irregularity be of a nature 
so as to convert the process of acting in aid of justice to a process of gross 
injustice. In such eventuality a review petition would be competent. Similarly, 
fact that the conclusion drawn in a judgment is wrong would not warrant 
review of the same but if the conclusion is wrong because something manifest 
has been ignored by the Court or the Court has not considered an important 
aspect of the matter, a review petition would lie. Furthermore, principle of law 
is well recognized that Supreme Court would not exercise the power of review 
as a routine matter to rehear a case already decided but the same can be pressed 
into service where a glaring omission on the face of record or patent error has 
crept the judgment by judicial fallibility."  
It is also a settled question of law that review also cannot be allowed on 
the discovery of some new material if such material was available at the 
time of trial, the appeal or the revision as the case may be. Review 
cannot be made a pretext for re-arguing the whole case and the matter 
cannot be revived under the garb of a review application. Reliance in 
this regard is placed  on the case titled Abdul Hakeem and another v. 
Khalid Wazir (2003 SCMR 1501), wherein it has been observed as 
under:-  
 
"7. Learned counsel relied on Abdul Ghaffar v. Asghar Ali (PLD 1998 SC 363) 
and asserted that review under Order XLVII, Rule 1, C.P.C. could be allowed 

8 
Review Application No.07 of 2024 
 
        In 
Intra Court Appeal No. 57 of 2024 
 
 
only when some new and important matter or evidence has been discovered 
which, after exercise of due diligence, was not within his knowledge or could 
not be produced. However, that an order could be reviewed on account of some 
mistake or error apparent on the face of record. He went on to submit that the 
equality of the right of vendee, if at all, was or should have been in the 
knowledge of the vendee right from day one. That it should have been asserted 
before the Court of original jurisdiction, if not, before the First Appellate Court 
and at the most before the Court of revisional jurisdiction. Having not agitated 
this point before all the forums, the vendees cannot derive advantage through 
the process of review. Order XLVII, Rule 1 of the C.P.C. clearly lays down 
that review proceedings cannot partake re-hearing of a decided case. Review 
also cannot be allowed on the ground of discovery of some new material if 
such material was available at the time of hearing of the trial, the appeal or the 
revision, as the case may be. A ground not urged or raised at such earlier stages 
cannot be allowed to be raised in review proceedings."  
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case titled Majid 
Mahmood v. Muhammad Shafi (2008 SCMR 554) has held as under:-  
 
"8. The exercise of review jurisdiction does not mean a rehearing of the matter 
and as finality attaches to the order, a decision, even though it is erroneous per 
se, would not be a ground to justify its review. Accordingly, in keeping with 
the limits of the review jurisdiction, it is futile to reconsider the submissions, 
which converge on the merits of the decision. It needs no reiteration that before 
an error can be a ground for review, it is necessary that it must be one which 
is apparent on the face of the record, that is, it must be so manifest, so clear 
that no Court could permit such an error to remain on the record. It may be an 
error of fact or of law, but if must be an error which is self evident and floating 
on the surface and does not require any elaborate discussion or process of 
ratiocination. It is not denied that if the Court has taken a conscious and 
deliberate decision on a point of law or fact while disposing of a petition or an 

9 
Review Application No.07 of 2024 
 
        In 
Intra Court Appeal No. 57 of 2024 
 
 
appeal, review of such judgment or order cannot be obtained on the grounds 
that the Court took an erroneous view or that another view on reconsideration 
is possible. Review also cannot be allowed on the ground of discovery of some 
new material, if such material was available at the time of hearing of appeal or 
petition but not produced."  
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case titled Ali Ahmad v. 
Muhammad Iqbal (2009 SCMR 394) has observed as under:-  
 
"A review by its very nature was not an appeal or rehearing merely on the 
ground that one party or another conceived himself to be dissatisfied with the 
decision of the Court"  
6.   
In view of the foregoing discussion, we are unanimous that the 
instant review application is misconceived and unfounded and is hereby 
dismissed.
