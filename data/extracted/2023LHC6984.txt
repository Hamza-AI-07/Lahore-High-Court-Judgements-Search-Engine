JUDGMENT 
Date of hearing 
 
15.12.2023  
 
Petitioners by 
 
Mr. Fida Hussain Rana, learned 
Advocate. 
Respondent by 
Mr. Amir Wakeel Butt, Syed Hassan 
Ali Gillani and Sahibzada Saleem 
Raza (learned Advocates) along with 
Muhammad Siddique respondent in 
person. 
 
SULTAN TANVIR AHMAD, J:– Through 
this civil revision, filed under section 115 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908 (the ‘Code’), the revision-petitioners have 
assailed judgment and decree dated 01.03.2011 passed by the 
learned District Judge, Toba Tek Singh. 
2. 
Muhammad Siddique, the respondent, instituted 
suit against revision-petitioners seeking declaration that he is 
owner of property measuring 4 marla falling in khewet 
Number 236 khatooni number 432/433, village 287/JB, tehsil 
and district Toba Tek Singh (the ‘suit property’), however, the 
revision-petitioners managed verbal mutation No. 1273 dated 
21.04.2007 (the ‘mutation’) in their favour in connivance with 
revenue officials. The revision-petitioners have contested the 
suit and filed the written statement. Out of the divergent 
pleadings, the learned trial Court framed the following issues:- 

C.R. No. 849-2011 
2 
 
 
1. Whether plaintiff is owner in possession of the 
suit land? OPP 
 
2. Whether defendants got mutation by way of 
sale No. 1273, dated 21.04.2008 related to suit 
land legally and lawfully? OPD 
 
3. Whether defendants are in possession of the 
suit land? OPD 
 
4. Whether no cause of action lies in the favour 
of the plaintiff and against the defendants and 
suit is liable to be dismissed? OPD 
 
5. Whether plaintiff merely filed suit in hand just 
to annoy and harass the defendants and it is 
liable to be dismissed with special cost under 
section 35-A Civil Procedure Code, 1908? 
OPD 
 
6. Relief?   
3. 
The parties led their respective evidence. The 
learned trial Court vide judgment and decree dated 27.01.2011 
dismissed the suit. It was observed by the learned trial Court 
that evidence of tehsildar (DW-2) and patwari (DW-3) is 
sufficient to prove the mutation. The said judgment and decree 
was challenged through civil appeal No. 44-13 of 2011 dated 
07.02.2011, which was accepted vide judgment dated 
01.03.2011 and the suit of the respondent was decreed in his 
favour as per the prayer. Aggrieved from the same the present 
civil revision has been filed.    
4. 
Mr. Fida Hussain Rana, learned counsel for the 
revision-petitioners has submitted that the learned Appellate 
Court fell to an error, while failing to give issue-wise findings, 
thus, violated Order XLI, Rule 31 of the Code. He has further 
brought it in the notice of the Court that application No. 01-
2020 is pending for producing further evidence.  
5. 
Mr.  Amir Wakeel Butt, Syed Hassan Ali Gillani 
and Sahibzada Saleem Raza, learned counsel of the respondent 
have vehemently opposed the above contentions by stating that 
the decision of the learned Appellate Court contains reasons 
for setting aside the judgment of the learned trial Court, on the 

C.R. No. 849-2011 
3 
 
points for determination, therefore, the objection raised as to 
failure to follow Order XLI, Rule 31 of the Code is not tenable. 
The learned counsel, while reading the evidence led by two 
sides, have stated that the respondent has proved his stance by 
leading confidence inspiring evidence, whereas, the revision-
petitioners failed to support the mutation by producing any 
relevant witness and even those who claimed to have 
witnessed the transaction deposed in favour of the respondent; 
that the revision-petitioners are just delaying the proceedings 
by various means to blackmail the respondent; that the 
revision-petitioners are part of a group of land grabbers and 
they managed the mutation in collusion with the patwari 
appointed at the relevant time. 
6. 
I have heard arguments of the learned counsel for 
the parties and perused the documents available on the record 
with their able assistance.  
7.  
The revision-petitioners have setup the defence in 
their pleading on three foundations (i) oral bargain, (ii) 
agreement dated 10.04.2007 (the ‘agreement’) and (iii) 
genuineness of the mutation. The written statement is silent 
about the names of the witnesses of oral bargain, the 
agreement as well as the place and time when the bargain took 
place. The defence is setup in preliminary objections, whereas, 
on merit paragraphs of the plaint are evasively denied by 
simply stating that the facts stated therein are incorrect.  
8. 
Tehsildar and patwari appeared as DW-2 and 
DW-3. The mutation (Exh.P4) is witnessed by Ali Muhammad 
Virk (lambardar) and Ashiq Ali son of Muhammad Tufail 
(patidar), who were never produced by the revision-
petitioners. Somehow, Ali Muhammad Virk lambardar 
appeared from the respondent-side as PW-1 and he denied his 
signatures on the mutation as well as passing of the mutation in 
his presence. His evidence remained coherent during cross-

C.R. No. 849-2011 
4 
 
examination. There is no explanation on record for not 
producing the second preferred witness i.e. Ashiq Ali son of 
Muhammad Tufail (patidar). The Land Revenue Act, 1967 and 
the rules framed thereunder prefers mutation to be sanctioned 
in the presence of lambardar and respectable(s) of the relevant 
village, having clear rationale that such transactions have some 
inviolability 
and 
when 
require 
the 
aforementioned 
respectable(s) can depose accordingly.  
9. 
As already observed the written statement is silent 
as to the witnesses of oral bargain. Later one Abdul Razaq 
(DW-5) was introduced to fill this gap, who also claimed to be 
tenant of the revision-petitioners but failed to produce any 
receipt of rent or payment of utility bills by him of the 
premises in question. He claimed that documents reflecting 
payments of rents or utility charges are at his home but never 
bothered to produce such documents until today. 
10. 
Somehow, the agreement, one of the most crucial 
documents, is not produced during the trial or proceedings of 
appeal and then nine (09) years of this revision-petition. 
Thereafter, a miscellaneous application bearing No. 01 of 2020 
was instituted, in the year 2020, seeking permission to produce 
the agreement. The same reflects Abid Yaseen and Zafar 
Yaseen as witnesses and Zulfiqar Ali as stamp-vendor.  The 
names of the said persons are not only missing in the pleadings 
but there remained complete silence as to them for 13 years.  
The learned counsel has failed to utter a word to explain this 
position.  The miscellaneous application and the accompanied 
agreement is not just an   attempt to derail the proceedings and 
to fill in lacuna but at the same time it is an attempt to prolong 
the status quo as to the suit property.  
11. 
In course of evidence, Tehsildar (DW-2) and 
Ghulam Murtaza-patwari (DW-3) stated that Ali Muhammad 
Virk identified the respondent and witnessed the mutation, 

C.R. No. 849-2011 
5 
 
who already denied the event when he appeared as PW-1. 
Tehsildar or patwari during the trial could not explain the 
reasons for not bringing pert-sarkar with them. No application 
for comparison of signatures of lambardar (PW-1) on the 
mutation is instituted. 
12. 
On the other hand, the respondent stood by his 
pleadings in examination-in-chief. He was cross-examined but 
his answers to all the questions put to him remained 
reasonable. He denied consideration and deposed that the 
revision-petitioners are part of gang of land grabbers. His 
statement is supported by PW-1 / the lambardar, through 
coherent evidence.  
13. 
Learned counsel for the revision-petitioners stated 
that the learned Appellate Court fell to an error, while failing 
to give issue-wise findings. Order XLI, Rule 31 of the Code 
requires that the written judgment of the Appellate Court to 
state (a) the points for determination; (b) the decision thereon; 
(c) the reasons for the decision; and (d) where the decree 
appealed from is reversed or varied, the relief to which the 
appellant is entitled. Undeniably, non-adherence of the said 
provision can be fatal and the same can only be ignored if there 
has been a substantial compliance of the provision. The 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in case titled “Pakistan Refinery 
Ltd., Karachi vs. Barrett Hodgson Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd. and 
others” (2019 SCMR 1726) examined the said provision and 
observed that the rationale behind the provision is that not only 
the party losing the case but the next higher forum to know 
what weighed with the learned Court in deciding the lis against 
one party and in favour of the other. In “Ch. Abdul Kabeer vs. 
Mian Abdul Wahid and others” (1968 SCMR 464), “Mst. 
Roshi and others vs. Mst. Fateh and others” (1982 SCMR 
542) as well as “Qadir Bakhsh (deceased) through L.Rs vs. 
Allah Dewaya and another” (2011 SCMR 1162) the Supreme 

C.R. No. 849-2011 
6 
 
Court observed that the question whether in a particular case 
there has been a substantial compliance with the provision of 
rule 31 would depend on the nature of the judgment which is 
under appeal. For example, if the finding on a question of fact 
has been arrived at on proper and legal evidence there could 
be no ground for interference……..But when important points 
of law are involved in the case the appellate court must 
indicate the points raised and reasons for its decision. 
14. 
Reverting to the judgment assailed before me. The 
learned Appellate Court recorded the points raised by the two 
sides and gave findings of facts on the basis of correct 
appreciation of evidence and law applicable thereupon. The 
reasonings rendered by the learned Appellate Court are though 
brief but they are pertinent. I have gone through the entire 
record very carefully and reached to a firm opinion that the 
learned Appellate Court has correctly allowed the suit. The 
contention that the points for determination have not been 
formulated in a sequential manner or issue-wise finding is not 
recorded, has lost force since the material questions have 
already been answered in substantial compliance.  
15. 
The learned counsel for the revision-petitioners 
has failed to convince as to any infirmity in the impugned 
judgment warranting interference by this Court in revisional 
jurisdiction. Resultantly, the revision petition as well as 
application for additional evidence are dismissed. No order as 
to cost.
