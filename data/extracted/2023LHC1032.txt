Mr. M. Asad Buttar, Advocate for Applicant.

Advocates for the Petitioner-SECP. 
 
By this application under Section 414 of the 
Companies Act, 2017 (the “Act”), Umer Saleem 
Director/Chief Executive of Mukhtar Textile Mills 
Limited (the “Company”) has prayed for recalling of 
winding up order dated 27.02.2018. 
Context 
2. 
The “Company” was wound up vide judgment 
dated 27.02.2018 on the grounds of suspension of its 
business operation since 2011, laying off entire staff in 
order to avoid incurring expenditure. While passing the 
winding up order, the Court appointed official liquidator 
with direction to submit preliminary report in respect of 
matters as envisaged under Section 321 of the “Act”. 
During winding up proceedings, the application in hand 
was filed.  
 
Proceedings in the Court. 
3. 
After passing of winding up order, the application in 
hand was filed by the Applicant for recalling of winding 
up order. On 18.12.2018, the official liquidator submitted

that the Respondents are not cooperating with him 
however, the Court directed the Respondents to provide 
required information but restrained the official liquidator 
to proceed with disposal of the “Company” as the 
captioned application had been filed which came up for 
hearing first time before this Court on 17.11.2021. Since 
then, objection to the maintainability of the petition was 
raised which is being decided through this order.  
 
Applicant’s Arguments 
4. 
Mr. Muhammad Asad Buttar, Advocate inter alia 
argues that the “Company” has now formulated a revival 
plan as the management/shareholders intend to induct 
further capital in the “Company” for its operation in 
future; that presently the assets of the “Company” are 
more than that of its liabilities and total liability of the 
“Company” stands at Rs.14.241 million while minimum 
written down value of assets is Rs.42.00 million; that the 
“Company” is regularly filing its statutory reports to the 
SECP, therefore, it may be revived and winding up order 
may be recalled. He relied on the judgments passed by this 
Court in “SAUDI PAK INDUSTRIAL & AGRICULTURAL 
INVESTMENT 
COMPANY 
LTD 
Versus 
CHENAB 
LIMITED” (2020 CLD 339) and “THE ADDITIONAL 
REGISTRAR COMPANY Versus AL-QAIM SUGAR 
MILLS LIMITED” (2021 CLD 931).  
 
 
Petitioner-SECP Arguments  
 
5. 
Mr. Adil Umar Bandial, Advocate objected to the 
maintainability of the application on the grounds inter alia 
that Section 414 of the “Act” is not applicable to the facts 
and circumstances of the case; that the applicant has no  
locus-standi to file this petition being not permitted person 
in terms of Section 313 of the “Act”; that the application 

C.M.No.02 of 2018

C.O.No.39619 of 2017

is not permissible under the law as it should have been 
filed by the official liquidator in terms of Section 337(e) of 
the “Act”; that the “Company” is still under liquidation 
and the cause underlying in terms of its winding up has not 
been disappeared and as such it has lost its substratum.  
Determination by the Court 
6. 
The 
contents 
of 
the 
application 
alongwith 
documents viz. Schedule-I, 26th Annual Report (Annex-A) 
and Interim Financial Information (Un-Audited) (Annex-
B) have been perused. Apparently, the application was 
filed under Section 414 of the “Act” with the prayer to 
recall the winding up order. The said section reads as: 
 
“414. Power of Court to declare 
dissolution of company void.- (1) 
Where a company has been 
dissolved, the Court may at any 
time within two years of the date 
of 
the 
dissolution, 
on 
an 
application being made for the 
purpose by the liquidator of the 
company or by any other person 
who appears to the Court to be 
interested, make an order, upon 
such terms as the Court thinks fit, 
declaring the dissolution to have 
been void, and thereupon such 
proceedings may be taken as 
might have been taken if the 
company had not been dissolved.  
(2) It shall be the duty of the 
person on whose application the 
order was made, within fifteen 
days after the making of the order, 
to file with the registrar a certified 
copy of the order, and if that 
person fails so to do he shall be 
punishable 
a 
daily 
penalty 
specified in level 1 on the standard 
scale”.

7. 
Plain reading of above said section reveals that it 
empowers the Court to declare dissolution of a company 
void in case it was filed either by the liquidator or any 
person who appears to the Court to be interested, within 
two years of the date of dissolution of the Company but in 
the case in hand, no dissolution order has so far been 
passed by this Court rather the winding up proceedings are 
under way. Notably, the application in hand was filed by 
Umer 
Saleem, 
Director/Chief 
Executive 
of 
the 
“Company” therefore, Section 414 of the “Act” has no 
relevancy to the relief claimed for.  
8. 
A pivotal objection with regard to locus-standi of 
the Applicant has been raised by learned counsel for the 
Petitioner-SECP on the touchstone of Section 313 of the 
“Act” by relying on [Nilkanta Kolay, Petitioner v. The 
Official Liquidator, Respondent] AIR 1996 Calcutta 171 
whereby it was held that “the company, however, 
independently of the Liquidator does not appear to me to 
have any locus standi in such application”. Admittedly, 
winding up order was passed vide judgment dated 
27.02.2018 under Section 305 of the “Act” in the 
following manners: 
“9. 
The above letter has not been 
denied by Mukhtar Textile. It is clear 
from a reading of the letter above that 
the company has suspended its 
operation since 2011 and the entire 
staff has been laid-off in order to 
avoid incurring expenditures. Also 
Mukhtar Textile informed SECP that 
the entire record of the company is 
packed in gunny bags in haphazard 
manner and dumped in a store and 
thus reluctance was shown by the 
Chief Executive of Mukhtar Textile to 
arrange or inspecting the record. It 
has 
further 
been 
admitted 
that 
Mukhtar Textile has no regular

employee so as to assist the inspection 
team for the purpose of inspection”.  
 
9. 
Under the law, procedure for staying of winding up 
has been provided under Section 313 of the “Act” which 
reads as: 
313. Power of Court to stay 
winding up.-(1) The Court may at 
any time not later than three years 
after an order for winding up, on 
the application of any creditor or 
contributory or of the registrar or 
the Commission or a person 
authorised by it, and on proof to 
the satisfaction of the Court that 
all proceedings in relation to the 
winding up ought to be stayed, 
withdrawn, cancelled or revoked, 
make an order accordingly, on 
such terms and conditions as the 
Court thinks fit.  
(2) On any application under sub-
section (1), the Court may, before 
making an order, require the 
official liquidator to furnish to the 
Court a report with respect to any 
facts or matters which are in his 
opinion 
relevant 
to 
the 
application.  
(3) A copy of every order made 
under 
sub-section 
(1) 
shall 
forthwith be forwarded by the 
Court to the registrar, who shall 
make a minute of the order in his 
books relating to the company. 
 
10. 
A bare reading of the said Section reveals that two 
conditions are required to be satisfied for bringing an order 
of stay of winding up in existence (i) filing of an 
application either of the Official Liquidator or of any 
creditor or contributory or of the registrar or the 
Commission or a person authorized by it for stay of 
winding up proceedings; (ii) proof to the satisfaction of the 
Court that all proceedings in relation to the winding up 

C.M.No.02 of 2018  
              IN 
C.O.No.39619 of 2017                  
 
 
 
 
 
 6 
ought to be stayed. If the above two conditions are 
satisfied, the Court has the discretion to stay the winding 
up proceedings, either altogether or for a limited time by 
imposing appropriate terms and conditions. Pertinently, 
consequence of winding up order was that all the assets of 
the company would come under the control of the Court 
and management of the company would vest with 
liquidator instead of Directors and the Chief Executive of 
the company. Thus, the ground raised by Mr. Adil Umar 
Bandial, Advocate regarding locus standi of the Applicant 
is a valid. Moreover, under Section 337 (e) of the “Act”, 
only the official liquidator is empowered to institute or 
defend any suit, prosecution or other legal proceedings in 
the name and on behalf of the Company under liquidation 
but the instant application has not been filed as per 
requirement of Section 313 of the “Act” rather the same 
was filed by Umar Saleem, Director/Chief Executive and 
that too without any authorization.  
  
Furthermore, by perusing 26th Annual Report 
(Annex-A) it reveals that the “Company” was given on 
lease to M/s Fazal Awais Textiles from April, 2011. 
During the course of arguments, learned counsel for the 
Applicant stated that the “Company” has terminated the 
lease with M/s Fazal Awais Textile since 2021 but no 
proof whatsoever has been brought on record. It is also 
admitted in the aforesaid report that three of the Directors 
are not registered taxpayers; Directors have not gone 
through mandatory training and company’s internal audit 
function remained inoperative during the year. Besides 
this, the Directors and the management of the “Company” 
have breached various obligations under the provisions of 
various applicable laws as is evident from the judgment 
dated 27.02.2018. More so, minute examination of revival

plan transpires that it is neither verified, signed or even 
endorsed by all members of the management/shareholders 
nor the contents thereof are affirmed from independent 
verified auditors. Learned counsel for the Applicant has 
failed to satisfy the Court that the “Company” has 
removed the underlying causes which became basis for its 
winding up, which as per record, still subsist. It has held 
by this Court in the case of “SAUDI PAK INDUSTRIAL & 
AGRICULTURAL INVESTMENT COMPANY LTD Versus 
CHENAB LIMITED (2020 CLD 339) that “unless the 
cause underlying the winding up has disappeared, no 
order under Section 313 of the “Act” could be passed”. 
Admittedly, the winding up proceedings are still underway 
and staying of these proceedings at this stage will cause 
delay in liquidation process and prejudice to the rights of 
other creditors, if any, as protected under Section 314 of 
the “Act”. In this view of the matter, this application being 
not maintainable is dismissed.
