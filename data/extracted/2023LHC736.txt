The instant matter alongwith other application [Diary 
No.21059/2023] are fixed as objection cases. The learned 
counsel for the applicant has submitted that under Section 
25-A of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 this 
Court is competent to transfer an execution petition from 
one District to other District and in this regard he placed 
reliance on the judgment reported as Mian Muhammad 
Arshad Vs. Saba Gul and 5 others (2022 MLD 1280). But 
the office raised objection regarding maintainability of the 
petition on the basis of a judgment reported as Sawera 
Ikram Vs. Amir Naveed (PLD 2022 Lahore 600). 
Thereafter, the matter was referred by the Single Bench to 
the Hon‟ble Chief Justice for placing the matter before a 
larger Bench so as to settle conclusively this issue. 
Accordingly, the matter is fixed before this Division Bench 
to answer following question:- 
Whether a Family Court can transfer a suit, 
decree or execution petition, or can issue precept 
to a Family Court of the same district or of 
another district on its own?

2.  
To answer the above question it is appropriate to 
examine the Family Courts Act, 1964. Section 2(1)(b) of 
the Act ibid provides the definition of the “Family Court” as 
under:- 
“Family Court” means a Court constituted under this 
Act;” 
 
Section 3 of the Act ibid, deals with the establishment of 
Family Courts and Section 5 defines the jurisdiction of 
Family Courts, whereas Section 13-A of Act ibid describes 
the modus oparandi for execution of decrees of the Family 
Court. Section 13 of the Act ibid is reproduced as under: 
“Enforcement of decrees.– (1) The Family Court shall 
pass a decree in such form and in such manner as may 
be prescribed, and shall enter its particulars in the 
prescribed register. 
(2)  If any money is paid or any property is delivered in 
the presence of the Family Court, in satisfaction of the 
decree, it shall enter the fact of payment  [or] the 
delivery of property, as the case may be, in the aforesaid 
register. 
(3)  Where a decree relates to the payment of money and 
the decretal amount is not paid within time specified by 
the Court [not exceeding thirty days], the same shall, if 
the Court so directs be recovered as arrears of land 
revenue, and on recovery shall be paid to the decree-
holder. 
(4)  The decree shall be executed by the Court, passing it 
or by such other Civil Court as the District Judge may, 
by special or general order, direct. 
(5)  A Family Court may, if it so deems fit, direct that 
any money to be paid under a decree passed by it be 
paid in such installments as it deems fit.” 
 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis supplied)  
Under Section 25-A of the Act ibid the procedure is 
prescribed for the transfer of family cases. For ready 
reference it is reproduced as under:- 
25A.    Transfer 
of 
cases.– (1) 
Notwithstanding 
anything contained in any law the High Court may, 
either on the application of any party or of its own 
accord, by an order in writing– 
               (a)   transfer any suit or proceeding under this 
Act from one Family Court to another 
Family Court in the same District, or 

 
Objection Diary. No.16605 /2023 
 
3
from a Family Court of one District to a 
Family Court of another District; and 
               (b)   transfer any appeal or proceeding under 
this Act, from the District Court of one 
District to the District Court of another 
District. 
(2)  A District Court may, either on the application of 
any party or of its own accord, by an order in writing, 
transfer any suit or proceeding under this Act from one 
Family Court to another Family Court in a District or to 
itself and dispose it of as a Family Court. 
(2a) Where a Family Court remains vacant or the 
presiding officer remains on leave or absent for any 
reason, except due to vacations, for more than thirty 
days a District Court may, either on the application of 
any party or of its own accord, by order in writing, 
transfer any suit or proceeding from such Family Court 
to another Family Court in a District or to itself and 
disposed it of as a Family Court. 
(2b) On the application of any of the parties and after 
notice to. the parties and after hearing such of them as 
desire to be heard, or of its own motion without such 
notice, the Supreme Court may at any stage transfer any 
suit, appeal or other proceedings under this Act pending 
before a Court in one Province to a Court in another 
Province, competent to try or dispose of the same. 
(3)  Any Court to which a suit, appeal or proceeding is 
transferred under the preceding sub-sections, shall, 
notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, have the 
jurisdiction to dispose it of in the manner as if it were 
instituted or filed before it: 
      Provided that on the transfer of a suit, it shall not be 
necessary to commence the proceedings before the 
succeeding Judge de novo unless the Judge, for reasons 
to be recorded in writing directs otherwise. 
 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis supplied)  
 
The legislature inserted the non-obstante clause in sub-
section 1 of Section 25-A of the Act ibid, i.e. 
“notwithstanding anything contained in any law” and that 
has to be read in the context of what is intended in the 
enacting part of the provision and/or an overriding 
provision of law become apparent. The Hon‟ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan has elaborately explained the definition of 
non-obstante clause in Syed Mushahid Shah‟s1 case as 
under:-  
                                          
1. Syed Mushahid Shah & Others Vs. Federal Investment Agency & Others (2017 SCMR 1218)

“9. 
Section 7(4) of the Ordinance, 2001 confers 
exclusive jurisdiction on the Banking Courts with 
respect to certain matters albeit subsection (5) creates an 
exception to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Banking 
Courts. This confers a right on the financial institution to 
seek any remedy before any court or otherwise which 
may be available to it under the law by which the 
financial institution may have been established [Section 
7(5) (a)]. According to section 4 of the Ordinance, 2001 
reproduced above, its provisions “shall have effect 
notwithstanding 
anything 
inconsistent 
therewith 
contained in any other law for the time being in force.” 
This is essentially a non obstante clause which is 
defined as “A phrase used in documents to preclude any 
interpretation contrary to the stated object or purpose.” 
„Notwithstanding‟ means despite, in spite of a regardless 
of something. In this respect Justice G. P. Singh has 
aptly explained:- 
“A clause beginning with „notwithstanding 
anything contained in this Act or in some 
particular provision in the Act or in some 
particular Act or in any law for the time being in 
force‟, is sometimes appended to a section in the 
beginning, with a view to give the enacting part 
of the section in case of conflict an overriding 
effect over the provision or Act mentioned in the 
non obstante clause. It is equivalent to saying 
that in spite of the provision or Act mentioned in 
the non obstante clause, the enactment following 
it will have its full operation or that the 
provisions embraced in the non obstante clause 
will not be an impediment for the operation of 
the enactment.” 
In the judgment reported as Packages Limited through 
its General Manager and others v. Muhammad Maqbool 
and others (PLD 1991 SC 258) this Court observed:- 
“In our opinion a „non obstante‟ clause operates 
as an ouster of the earlier provisions only where 
there is a conflict and inconsistency between the 
earlier provisions and those contained in the 
later provision and, therefore, must be read in 
the context in which it is operating. Accordingly, 
a non obstante clause will operate as ouster only 
if an inconsistency between the two is found to 
exist.”

In the judgment reported as Muhammad Mohsin 
Ghuman and others v. Government of Punjab through 
Home Secretary, Lahore and others (2013 SCMR 85), 
this Court cited with approval a passage from 
Interpretation of Statutes by N. S. Bhindra which reads 
as under:- 
“It has to be read in the context of what the 
legislature conveys in the enacting part of the 
provision. It should first be ascertained what the 
enacting part of the section provides on a fair 
construction of words used according to their 
natural and ordinary meaning and the non 
obstante clause is to be understood as operating 
to set aside as no longer valid anything 
contained in relevant existing law which is 
inconsistent with the new enactment. The 
enacting part of a statute must, where it is clear, 
be taken to control the non obstante clause 
where both cannot be read harmoniously, for 
even apart from such clause a later law 
abrogates earlier laws clearly inconsistent with 
it. The proper way to construe a non obstante 
clause is first to ascertain the meaning of the 
enacting part on a fair construction of its words. 
The meaning of the enacting part which is so 
ascertained is then to be taken as overriding 
anything inconsistent to that meaning in the 
provisions mentioned in the non obstante clause. 
A non obstante clause is usually used in a 
provision to indicate that that provision should 
prevail despite anything to the contrary in the 
provision mentioned in such non obstante clause. 
In case there is any inconsistency between the 
non obstante clause and another provision one 
of the objects of such a clause is to indicate that 
it is the non obstante clause which would prevail 
over the other clauses. It does not, however, 
necessarily mean that there must be repugnancy 
between the two provisions in all such cases. The 
principle underlying non obstante clause may be 
invoked only in the case of „irreconcilable 
conflict‟.” 
From the above it is clear that the non obstante clause of 
section 4 of the Ordinance, 2001 has been used by the 
legislature to give the provisions of the said Ordinance 
an overriding effect over any other law for the time 
being in force which may be contrary thereto. The use of 

 
Objection Diary. No.16605 /2023 
 
6
the word „notwithstanding‟ in section 4 ibid indicates 
the legislative intent to avoid the operation of conflicting 
provisions, by providing that in the event of such 
conflict, the provisions of the Ordinance, 2001 would 
take precedence over any such inconsistent law.” 
  
Under Sub-Section (2) of Section 25 of the Act ibid, 
the District Judge has the power to transfer suit or 
proceeding from one Family Court to another Family Court 
in a District or to itself or dispose it of as a Family Court. 
Under Sub-Section 2-A, if any presiding officer of the 
Family Court remains on leave or is absent for any reason 
for more than 30 days, a District Court may, either on the 
application of any party or of its own accord, by order in 
writing, transfer any suit or proceeding from such Family 
Court to another Family Court in a District or to itself for 
disposal as a Family Court. Sub-Section 2-b of Section 25-
A of the Act ibid empowers the Hon‟ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan to transfer suit, appeal or proceeding pending 
before a Court in one Province to a Court in another 
Province. Reliance in this regard is placed on Rabia 
Ahmad‟s case2 wherein the August Apex Court has 
observed as under:- 
2. Be that as it may, it is apparent from section 25-A(2-
B) that all parties before a Court in proceedings under 
the Act have a remedy to seek the transfer of such 
proceedings to a competent Court in another province on 
the ground of, inter alia, expeditious disposal and 
convenience of the parties, particularly females and 
minor children. This is the law laid down in respect of 
transfers made under the afore-noted provision. In the 
present case, however, the said statutory remedy is not 
available 
to 
litigants 
seeking 
transfer 
of 
their 
proceedings to and from the ICT. There is no ground to 
justify the denial of this relief to litigants in Islamabad, 
especially when litigants in other parts of the country are 
entitled to it. Therefore, it is our considered view that in 
such circumstances the Court can resort to its 
extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 187 of the 
Constitution to provide for the transfer of proceedings.

For case of reference, the said provision is reproduced 
below:  
 
"187. Issue and Execution of Processes of Supreme 
Court. Subject to clause (2) of Article 175, the 
Supreme Court shall have power to issue such 
directions, orders or decrees as may be, necessary 
for doing complete justice in any case or matter 
pending before it, including an order for the 
purpose of securing the attendance of any person or 
the discovery or production of any document.” 
 
 
  
 
 
        (emphasis supplied) 
 
The ambit of this Court's power to do complete justice 
in matters pending before it was discussed in detail in 
the case of Dossani Travels Pvt.Ltd. v. Messrs Travel 
Shop, Pvt. Ltd. (PLD 2014 SC 1). The relevant portion 
from this judgment is produced below: 
 
"41: While seized of petitions under Article 199 of 
the Constitution, the High Courts at times are faced 
with prayers to pass order and Provide relief for 
“doing complete justice". But such powers in 
constitutional jurisdiction are vested in the 
Supreme Court under Article 187 of the 
Constitution. These powers are distinct both in 
scope and the manner of their exercise. The Apex 
Courts in most of the democratic countries enjoy 
such powers. The powers of this Court to pass any 
order or give any direction "for doing complete 
justice” are similar to those which the Supreme 
Court of India enjoys under Article 142 of the 
Constitution of India. 
 
42: In both the above quoted provisions, the 
paramount consideration and the constitutional 
intent is common i.e. "for doing complete justice". 
These powers being inherent are complementary to 
those which are specifically conferred on the Court 
by the Constitutions of these two countries. These 
powers remain undefined so that the Court can 
cater to an situation and could even mould the 
relief... The rationale appears to be that in 
situations which cannot be resolved by existing 
provisions of law and warrant an intervention by 
the Court it may pass an order to ensure “complete 
justice”. This can also be used where the Court 
finds a gap in legislation and a solution is required 
till the Legislature acts and covers the field.” 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
A perusal of the above quoted passages makes it clear 
that the power of this Court to do complete justice has 
intentionally been left undefined to ensure that it can 

 
Objection Diary. No.16605 /2023 
 
8
cater to any and all situations where the law as it exists 
leads to injustice. Such power can in fact even be used, 
as has been recognized in the Dossani Travels case 
(supra), to cover up gaps in the legislation. In the present 
case, we are also faced with a similar problem in that 
section 25-A(2-B) of the Act does not provide for the 
transfer of cases from the Courts in ICT to the Courts of 
another Province and vice versa. Therefore, to fill in the 
said lacuna in the Act, this Court has power under 
Article 187 of the Constitution to do complete justice by 
transferring proceedings to and from the ICT in 
deserving cases.  
 
In the above referred case, the Hon‟ble Supreme Court 
transferred the execution proceeding for expeditious 
disposal from the Family Court, Rawalpindi to District 
Judge, Islamabad.  
  
In Mst. Kulsoom Rasheed‟s3 case, the Hon‟ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan while invoking jurisdiction 
under sub-section (2b) of Section 25-A of the Act ibid, 
transferred the execution proceedings from Islamabad to 
Karachi for its expeditious disposal, and held as under:- 
“3. In view of the above stated legal position and 
looking into the facts and circumstances of the case, it 
would be cumbersome to issue notice to the respondent, 
who is resident of Karachi. Even otherwise it will 
burden the respondent with heavy cost on travelling or 
contesting the matter here. In order to protect the rights 
and interest of the parties and to ensure that right as 
conferred by Article 10A of the Constitution “fair trial” 
is protected, this Court can always make an order of 
transfer and the transferee court may take further 
proceedings from where it is left by the Court from 
which matter is transferred, only after due service of 
notice on the respondent. In view of the fact that the 
matter in issue relates to the execution of a decree 
passed in favour of the petitioner, who is also the wife of 
the respondent, the execution proceedings, in order to 
facilitate expeditious disposal, are ordered to be 
transferred from the Family Court/Guardian Judge, 
Islamabad-West 
to 
the 
District 
Judge, 
Karachi 
(concerned) who shall assign the matter to the 
competent Family Court concerned for the purpose of 
the execution of the judgment and decree noted above 
after due service on the respondent.”

Objection Diary. No.16605 /2023

In the said case, the execution petition was transferred from 
Islamabad to Karachi for its expeditious disposal while 
invoking jurisdiction under Sub-Section 2b of Section 25-A 
of the Act ibid.  
3. 
Now it is settled law that under Section 25-A of the 
Act 1964, High Court has the power to transfer suit, appeal, 
execution petition and other proceedings within District or 
outside the District. The execution procedure is defined 
under Section 13 of the Act ibid and the Family Court is 
competent to enforce money decree under the very act as 
well as it can recover the decretal amount as arrears of land 
Revenue and a complete mechanism for the satisfaction of 
the decree is defined in Chapter 8, Section 80 of the West 
Pakistan Land Revenue Act and the Family Court may 
adopt any procedure for execution of a decree. Under 
Section 25-A (2), the District Judge is competent to 
entertain application to transfer a suit or proceeding from 
one Family Court to another Family Court in a District to 
itself and dispose it of as a Family Court. Section 13 (4) 
also empowers the District Judge in this regard. Family 
Courts Act, 1964 is a special law enacted to provide 
facilities to litigants in Family matter. The Family Court has 
power to pass any order to meet the ends of justice and also 
has power to take steps for substantial justice. In the 
judgment reported as Mian Muhammad Arshad Vs. Saba 
Gul and 5 others (2022 MLD 1280), the Family Court 
transferred the execution petition on its own while relying upon 
the provision of Section 39 read with Order XXI Rule 5 CPC 
and transfer the said execution petition to another District. For 
ready reference Order XXI Rule 5 CPC is reproduced as under:- 
5. Mode of transfer.– Where the Court to which a 
decree is to be sent for execution is situate within the 
same District as the Court which passed such decree  
 

 
Objection Diary. No.16605 /2023 
 
10
such Court shall send the same directly to the former 
Courts. But, where the Court to which the decree is to be 
sent for execution is situate in a different District, the 
Court which passed it shall send it to the District Court  
of the District in which the decree is to be executed. 
 
Whereas, the learned Single Judge in Chamber in his 
pronouncement reported as “Sawera Ikram Vs. Amir 
Naveed” (PLD 2022 Lahore 600) has declared that the 
order passed by the learned executing Court/Family Court 
transferring the execution petition from Lahore to another 
District was in violation of Section 25-A of the Act, 1964 
and the Family Court is competent to only transmit precept 
for the purpose of attachment of property and for further 
proceeding to be taken in accordance with law. The concept 
of precept is defined  under Section 46 CPC, which is 
reproduced as under:- 
46. Precepts.– (1) Upon the application of the decree-
holder the Court which passed the decree may, 
whenever it thinks fit, issue a precept to any other Court 
which would be competent to execute such decree to 
attach any property belonging to the judgment-debtor 
and specified in the precept.  
(2) 
 The Court to which a precept is sent shall 
proceed to attach the property in the manner prescribed 
in regard to the attachment of property in execution of a 
decree.  
 
Provided that no attachment under a precept shall 
continue for more than two months unless the period of 
attachment is extended by an order of the Court which 
passed the decree or unless before the determination of 
such attachment the decree has been transferred to the 
Court by which the attachment has been made and the 
decree-holder has applied for an order for the sale of 
such property. 
Whereas, under Section 17 of the Family Courts Act ibid 
the Code of Civil Procedure except the provisions of 
Sections 10 & 11 whereof shall not be applicable to the 
proceedings before any Family Court. Section 17 of the Act 
ibid is as under:- 
“17. Provisions of Evidence Act and Code of Civil 
Procedure not to apply.– (1) Save as otherwise 
expressly provided by or under this Act, the provisions 
of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 (P.O.No.10 of 1984)], 

 
Objection Diary. No.16605 /2023 
 
11
and the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, except sections 
10 and 11 shall not apply to proceedings before any 
Family Court.  
(2) Sections 8 to 11 of the Oaths Act, 1873, shall apply 
to all proceedings before the Family Courts in respect of 
Part I of Schedule. 
The execution proceedings initiated for the satisfaction of 
the decree passed in respect of the Part 1 of the Schedule 
and under Section 13 of the Act ibid read with Section 80 of 
the Land Revenue Act, Family Court is competent to 
execute the same, as such Section 46 CPC is not applicable 
upon the execution proceeding of the Family Court. It is 
settled law that Courts are bound for rule of law and should 
perform its duties within the parameters prescribed under 
the law. The Family Court Act is a special law and the 
Family Judge is competent to do the needful for substantial 
justice, however, the CPC in stricto senso is not applicable 
to the proceeding before Family Court. Thus, the learned 
executing Court/Family Court is not competent to transfer 
the execution petition within District or outside the District 
and if it does so, it would be violation of Section 25-A of 
the Family Courts Act, meaning thereby the Family Court is 
not competent to issue any precept under Section 46 CPC 
for the attachment of any property rather it shall adopt the 
procedure mentioned under Section 80 of the Land Revenue 
Act, 1967.  
4. 
The word “proceeding” has defined by the Hon'ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in a Mst. Karim Bibi4 case as 
under: 
“8. After giving our anxious consideration to the arguments 
urged in support of this appeal we are, however, not impressed 
by any of the contentions raised. The test laid down by the 
Legislature in the proviso is that if the law applicable to the 
proceedings from which the Constitutional Petition arises 
provides for at least one appeal against the original order, then 
no appeal would be competent from the order of a Single 
                                          
4 Mst. Karim Bibi and others Vs. Hussain Bakhsh and another (PLD 1984 SC 344) 

 
Objection Diary. No.16605 /2023 
 
12
Judge in the constitutional jurisdiction to a Bench of two or 
more judges of the High Court. The crucial words are the 
“original order”.  It is clear from the wording of the proviso 
that the requirement of the availability of an appeal in the law 
applicable is not in relation to the impugned order in the 
Constitutional Petition, which may be the order passed by the 
lowest officer or authority in the hierarchy or an order passed 
by higher authorities in appeal, revision or review, if any, 
provided in the relevant statute. Therefore, the relevant order 
may not necessarily be the one which is under challenge but 
the test is whether the original order passed in the proceedings 
subject to an appeal under the relevant law, irrespective of the 
fact whether the remedy of appeal so provided was availed of 
or not.  Apparently the meaning of the expression “original 
order” is the order with which the proceedings under the 
relevant statute commenced. The word “proceedings” has 
been used in different enactments and has been subject to 
judicial interpretation in a number of cases wherein it has 
received either restricted or wide meaning according to the 
text and subject-matter of the particular statute. I do not 
consider it necessary to notice the various judgments in which 
this word was so construed. Suffice it to refer to the case of 
Nawab Din v. Member Board of Revenue (1) in which this 
Court had occasion to examine the scope and meaning of the 
word as it occurs in section 2 (2) of the Evacuee Property and 
Displaced Persons Laws (Repeal) Act, 1975. A useful 
discussion will be found in this case with reference to 
precedents as the meaning of the term “proceedings”. An 
earlier case of Jan Muhammad and another v. Home 
Secretary, West Pakistan and others (2) was referred to in this 
connection and the view taken therein was declared by this 
Court as the correct enunciation of the law on the subject. In 
the latter case reference was made to the definition of the term 
“proceedings” in the book “Words and phrases” which may 
usefully be reproduced as under; 
“The term „proceedings‟ is a very comprehensive term, 
and, generally speaking, means a prescribed course of 
action for enforcing a legal right, and hence it 
necessarily embraces the requisite steps by which 
judicial action is invoked. A „proceeding‟ would 
include every step taken towards the further progress 
of a cause in Court or before a Tribunal, where it may 
be pending. It is the step towards the objective to be 
achieved, say for instance the judgment in a pending 
suit. The proceeding commences with the first step by 
which the machinery of the law is put into motion in 
order to take cognizance of the case. It is indeed a 
comprehensive expression and includes all possible 
steps in the action under the law, from its 
commencement to the execution of the judgment.”

The Hon‟ble Apex Court affirmed the view rendered in the 
judgment (supra) in Muhammad Abdullah and SME Bank 
Limited cases.5  
5. 
In the light of the aforesaid discussion, we are of the 
considered view that under Section 17 read with 25-A of the 
West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, the provisions of 
the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 are not stricto senso 
applicable, therefore, a Family Court cannot transfer a suit, 
decree, execution petition or issue a precept to another 
Family Court within the same district or any other district 
on its own and the only mode to transfer a suit, appeal, 
decree or execution petition under the Act ibid is to 
approach this Court. As such, under Section 25 of the 
Family Courts Act, 1964 this Court is empowered to 
transfer any suit, proceeding under the Act ibid from one 
Family Court to another Family Court in the same District 
or from one Family Court in one District to another Family 
Court in other District. This Court has also power to 
transfer an appeal or proceeding under the Act ibid from 
one District to other whereas the District Judge is 
competent to transfer any such suit/proceedings from one 
Court to another within such district.
