JAWAD HASSAN, J. Through this judgment the Court will 
examine the validity of the judgments [which are at variance] of the 
Courts below for the welfare of the minor. This constitutional petition 
under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”) calls in question the vires of 
consolidated judgment and decree dated 30.01.2024, whereby the 
Additional District Judge, Rawalpindi, while allowing the appeal of 
the Respondent No.1, modified the judgment passed by Senior 
Guardian Judge (Family Division), Rawalpindi. Besides, the 
Petitioner has also challenged orders dated 01.07.2024 and 
02.07.2024 passed by the Family Executing Court, Rawalpindi 
through separate W.P.No.2050 of 2024 as the same were passed 
during the pendency of instant petition.  
  
Facts of W.P.No.452 of 2024 
2. 
A guardian petition under Section 25 of the Guardians and 
Wards Act, 1890 (the “Act”) seeking permanent custody of minor 
Zuria Noor (the “minor”), was filed by Zainab Noor (the 
“Respondent No.1”) before the Senior Civil Judge (Family Division), 

Writ Petition No.452 of 2024 
Writ Petition No.2050 of 2024  
 
 
 
 
 
 
          2 
Rawalpindi on 16.01.2021. The said petition was duly contested by 
Irfan Arshad (the “Petitioner”) through filing of reply. Ultimately, 
Guardian Petition was declined after framing of issues and recording 
of oral and documentary evidence adduced by both the parties vide 
order dated 20.07.2023 and visitation schedule for meeting of the 
“minor” with the “Respondent No.1” was chalked out. Being 
dissatisfied from above said order, the parties preferred their 
respective appeals before the Additional District Judge, Rawalpindi 
who dismissed the appeal of the “Petitioner” and while accepting that 
of the “Respondent No.1”, vide consolidated judgment and decree, 
directed to hand over custody of the “minor” to the “Respondent 
No.1” by also modifying the visitation schedule of the “minor” with 
the “Petitioner”. Then, the “Petitioner”, being aggrieved of above 
said judgment, filed this petition.  
Facts of W.P.No.2050 of 2024 
3. 
In addition to the facts narrated above, the “Respondent No.1” 
filed an application before the Family Executing Court with 
apprehension of removal of the “minor” by the “Petitioner” from 
local limits of Rawalpindi. Upon filing of said application, warrants 
under Section 100 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (the 
“Cr.PC”) were issued against the “Petitioner” on the basis of which 
attorney of the “Respondent No.1” filed petition under Section 491 of 
the “Cr.PC” before the District and Sessions Court, Lahore for 
recovery of the “minor” which was accepted vide order dated 
29.06.2024 and temporary custody of the “minor” was handed over to 
special attorney of the “Respondent No.1” namely Humaira Iram with 
direction to her to produce the “minor” before the Family Executing 
Court at Rawalpindi on 02.07.2024. However, the Family Executing 
Court passed the orders despite stay of execution proceedings by this 
Court.  
4. 
Pertinently, this Court made efforts to resolve the issue 
between the parties through mode of mediation as per judgments 
reported in “FAISAL ZAFAR and another versus SIRAJ-UD-DIN and 

Writ Petition No.452 of 2024 
Writ Petition No.2050 of 2024

MAATSCHAPPIJ VOOR ONTWIKKELINGSLANDEN N.V. (F.M.O) 
versus MORGAH VALLEY LIMITED and SECP” (PLD 2024 Lahore 
315) and for the said purpose, with consent of the parties, mediator 
was appointed on 04.06.2024 but the mediation remained fruitless 
therefore, this petition is being decided on merit. 
  
SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES  
5. 
Learned counsel for the Petitioner inter alia argues that the 
lower Appellate Court has committed error of law while awarding 
custody of the “minor” to the “Respondent No.1”; that the impugned 
judgment is unsound, sketchy, absurd, baseless and has been passed 
without appreciating the contentions of the Petitioner properly; that 
the “Respondent No.1” is 80 years old lady having multiple health 
issues and is unable to look after the “minor” and even did not 
appear in the witness box but this important aspect of the matter has 
been overlooked by the lower Appellate Court; that the family 
atmosphere of the “Respondent No.1” is not suitable for the 
“minor” as the Respondent No.1 herself is dependent on her 
daughters; that the “minor” needs full care and attention of a father 
instead of maternal grandmother, therefore, under the law the 
“Petitioner” is entitled to have the custody of the “minor” but the 
Additional District Judge, Rawalpindi has failed to properly 
appreciate these facts. 
6. 
On the other hand, learned counsel for the “Respondent No.1” 
controverted the stance of the “Petitioner” by supporting the 
impugned judgment and decree passed by the lower Appellate Court 
pursuant to proper appreciation of the facts and circumstances of the 
case. 
7. 
I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the parties 
and carefully perused the record.  
  
DETERMINATION BY THE COURT 
8. 
The issue relates to the custody of the “minor”, who was born 
on 08.09.2016 and now is aged about eight years. It is an admitted 
fact that mother of the “minor” namely Navira Arzo took her last 

Writ Petition No.452 of 2024 
Writ Petition No.2050 of 2024  
 
 
 
 
 
 
          4 
breath on 04.09.2020. The matter in controversy was duly 
encapsulated by Senior Guardian Judge (Family Division), 
Rawalpindi while framing three issues but issue No.1 is very pertinent 
which reads as under :- 
1. 
Whether the welfare of the minor lies with the 
petitioner? OPP 
 
9. 
In order to prove her case, Humaira Iram appeared as Special 
Attorney on behalf of the “Respondent No.1” as AW-1 and in her 
support, she produced Muhammad Saeed husband of the Respondent 
No.1 as A-W2. In documentary evidence, affidavit of the 
“Respondent No.1” was produced as Exh.P-1, special power of 
attorney of Humaira Iram as Exh.P2, pictures of the “minor” as 
Exh.P3, WhatsApp Screen Shots of physical torture as Exh.P4, 
WhatsApp conversation of blackmailing as Exh.P5, Bank Statement 
of mother of the “minor” as Exh.P6 and USB voice recording of 
sexual harassment as Exh.P7. On contrary, the “Petitioner” put his 
appearance in the witness box as RW-1 and in his support produced 
his affidavit as Exh.R-1, Receipts of School Fee as Exh.R-2, Three 
Certificate of NGS relating to the “minor” as Exh.R-3, School Report 
as Exh.R-4 and swimming activity of the “minor” for summer camp 
as Mark-A-1.  
10. 
The Senior Civil Judge (Family Division), Rawalpindi on the 
basis of above said evidence, recorded his findings and resultantly 
proceeded to dismiss custody petition by handing over the custody of 
the “minor” to the “Petitioner”. However, lower Appellate Court 
reversed the findings and modified the judgment on the inter alia 
grounds that the ”Petitioner” had strained relations with the mother 
of the “minor” as such had not spent quality time with the “minor”; 
that the “Petitioner” has contracted second marriage in the month of 
November, 2020; that the “Petitioner” had no knowledge regarding 
blood group of the “minor” and even had no knowledge about name 
of hospital where the “minor” was born; the “Petitioner” had not 
appended school leaving certificate of the “minor”; that the 

Writ Petition No.452 of 2024 
Writ Petition No.2050 of 2024  
 
 
 
 
 
 
          5 
“Petitioner” had shifted his residence from Rawalpindi to Lahore; 
that the “Petitioner” had illegally drawn amount from the bank 
account of the mother of the “minor” without getting succession 
certificate.   
11. 
Before adverting to the merits of the case, the Court is of the 
considered view that the utmost priority of the Court in determining 
the custody of a minor is to see his/her welfare and well-being. This is 
the reason, law provides a parental jurisdiction to the Guardian Judge 
in such cases. The objective of the law is not just handing over the 
custody of the minor, but to examine all the aspects which are 
ancillary to it. The power and duty of the Court while considering the 
question of custody of a minor is to thoroughly and comprehensively 
take into consideration the minor's welfare. The word "welfare" in 
such cases is to be taken in its widest sense, which includes not only 
the monetary expenses of the minor but also his mental and physical 
health, educational needs, psychological well-being, religious and 
moral values. The Courts are duty bound to consider such cases in the 
best interest and healthy up-bringing of the minor which sometimes 
may yield the rights of the parents. No doubt according to certain 
Muslim jurists, custody of a minor son till the age of seven years may 
remain with the mother and in the case of minor daughter till she 
attains the age of puberty and thereafter, normally their custody 
should be restored to the father. However, it is an established principle 
of law that the paramount consideration in all such situations would 
be the betterment of the minor and even a mother may be deprived of 
the custody of a minor if circumstances of the case so allow. In the 
cases, concerning the custody of a child, the Guardian Court is not 
required to go into the intricacies/technicalities of the matter, rather is 
obliged to confine itself to the extent of the welfare of the child/minor, 
which is a paramount consideration. 
12. 
The consideration for grant or refusal of custody of minors 
will always be determined on the basis of their welfare, that is to 

Writ Petition No.452 of 2024 
Writ Petition No.2050 of 2024  
 
 
 
 
 
 
          6 
consider what is in the best interest of the child. The court's 
jurisdiction in custody cases is in the form of parental jurisdiction 
which means that the court must consider all factors from the 
parents' ability to provide for the child including physical and 
emotional needs, medical care but also relevant is the parents' 
ability to provide a safe and secure home where the quality of the 
relationship between the child and each parent is comforting for the 
child. Hence, there is no mathematical formula to calculate the 
welfare of the minor, as the factors range from financial and 
economic considerations to the household environment, the care, 
comfort and attention that a child gets. Accordingly, the concept of 
welfare of the child is an all encompassing concept which will 
cover not only the manner in which the child has to be cared for but 
will also include the physical, mental and emotional wellbeing of 
the child. Custody is about the care and comfort of the child and the 
right of the child to a family. Custody matters are always sensitive 
and require a great deal of care as the court has to weigh in all 
factors in order to determine where the welfare of the minor lies. In 
cases of remarriage, circumstances change, hence, while looking at 
the welfare of the child, the entire living arrangement and 
environment has to be reassessed in the context of the welfare of 
the child. Fundamental to this decision is the best interest of  
the child and not that of the parent. This Court in case titled as 
SAJIDA REHMAT ULLAH versus GUARDIAN JUDGE-II and 
others (PLD 2022 183) has expounded the concept of welfare and 
held that welfare is a question of fact and has to be determined on 
the basis of the material placed before a judge and not on the 
presumption and is also includes material welfare as well as a sense 
of adequacy of care to ensure the good health and due personal 
right are maintained and also it signifies the stability and the 
security the loving and understanding care and guidance, the warm 

Writ Petition No.452 of 2024 
Writ Petition No.2050 of 2024  
 
 
 
 
 
 
          7 
and compassion made relationship for the essential of the full 
development of the child on character. The relevant portion of the 
judgment reads as under:  
"Welfare" is an all-encompassing word. On 
the one hand, "it includes material welfare, 
both in the sense of an adequacy of resources 
to 
provide 
a 
pleasant 
home 
and 
a 
comfortable standard of living and in the 
sense of an adequacy of care to ensure that 
good health and due personal pride are 
maintained."1 On the other hand, it signifies 
"the stability and the security, the loving and 
understanding care and guidance, the warm 
and compassionate relationships that are 
essential for the full development of the 
child's own character, personality and 
talents."2 In Rahimullah Choudhury v. 
Sayeda Helali Begum and others (1974 
SCMR 305) the Hon'ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan held that "welfare" is a question of 
fact and has to be determined on the basis of 
the materials placed before the Judge and 
not on presumptions. 
 
13. 
In this case, permanent custody of the “minor” is the main 
contest between the “Petitioner” (father) and the “Respondent No.1” 
(maternal grandmother). It evinces from the record that Senior Civil 
Judge (Family Division), Rawalpindi, vide judgment dated 
20.07.2023, declined to handover permanent custody of the “minor” 
to the “Respondent No.1” due to her ailment and dependency over her 
daughters. However, at appeal stage and even before this Court, the 
“Respondent No.1” leveled serious allegations against the Petitioner’s 
character, his involvement in sexual misconduct with sister of his 
second wife, snatching of the minor from the maternal family in year 
2020 and involvement of the “Petitioner” in murder of mother of the 
“minor”.  Likewise, the “Petitioner” also leveled allegations against 
the “Respondent No.1” and her family and the atmosphere prevalent 
there.

Writ Petition No.2050 of 2024  
 
 
 
 
 
 
          8 
14. 
Section 25 of the “Act” relates to transfer of the custody of 
minor if he leaves or is removed from the custody of a guardian of his 
person. Paramount and supreme consideration in custody of minor is 
the welfare of minor and nothing else. Any issue regarding the 
custody of minor is to be assessed, examined and measured by the 
Guardian Courts on such yard stick and the Court has to record a 
definite finding on the point before passing any order in the matter. 
The Guardian Court, while passing order, has to see the age, sex, 
environment under which the minor is being brought up and all the 
attending circumstances, position of parties and also the law to which 
the minor is subject. The “Respondent No.1”, after the death of real 
mother of the “minor”, filed petition under Section 25 of the “Act” 
on 16.01.2021 before the Senior Civil Judge (Family Division), 
Rawalpindi, contents whereof reveal that it was filed mainly on the 
grounds inter alia that the “Respondent No.1” is residing with her 
daughter Humaira Iram who is unmarried and educated lady having 
good health to look after the “minor”; that the “Respondent No.1” 
has superior right of custody of the “minor” after the demise of 
mother of the “minor”; that the “Petitioner” has contracted second 
marriage and the “minor” is not being looked after in a proper way.  
15. 
The dates qua initiation of litigation between the parties are 
very relevant. It was all started when the mother of the “minor” 
namely Navira Arzoo died on 04.09.2020 and date of her death is not 
disputed by either of the party. It is also not disputed that the 
“Petitioner” and the mother of the “minor” had strained relations and 
as per stance of the “Respondent No.1”, the “minor” was living with 
her since birth and was getting education from ACE-International 
Academy. Perusal of custody petition filed under Section 25 of the 
“Act” by the Respondent No.1 before Senior Civil Judge (Family 
Division), Rawalpindi reveal that the “Respondent No.1” did not 
mention the fact of study of the “minor” at ACE-International School, 
Bahria Town, Rawalpindi however, the same was agitated by her in 
appeal and even before this Court by stating that minor Zuria attended 

Writ Petition No.452 of 2024 
Writ Petition No.2050 of 2024  
 
 
 
 
 
 
          9 
the complete sessions 2019-2020 and for the purpose of proving this 
very fact, relied on Exh.P-3 bare perusal of which reveals that it was 
neither a school certificate issued by the ACE International Bahria nor 
the receipts regarding payment of fee etc. Needless to add that though 
the attorney of the “Respondent No.1” during cross examination 
deposed that “the “minor” was studying at ACE International 
Academy Bahria” but no documentary proof in this regard was ever 
produced even before the Guardian Court or before the Additional 
District Judge, Rawalpindi. She further admitted and deposed that “I 
have not produced the source of Exh.P.3 and Exh.P.4 and Exh.P.5, 
Exh.P.7”. If it is considered as correct for the sake of arguments that 
such documents could not be exhibited or were not in possession at 
that time, even then the “Respondent No.1” could produce the same 
by filing application for production of additional documents but this 
opportunity, provided by law, was never availed. Further, the 
Additional District Judge observed that “the minor was emotionally 
attached with her mother till she remained alive and did get proper 
education at Rawalpindi”. Evidence produced by the “Respondent 
No.1” reveals that only Exh.P-3 was produced as proof of getting 
education at ACE International Rawalpindi, perusal of which reveals 
that it is only a picture of the “minor” doing some painting. No 
supporting document qua admission form, payment receipts etc. in the 
said school was ever produced. On the other hand, the “Petitioner” 
produced Exh.R-3, Bonafide Certificate dated 20.06.2023 certifying 
by NGS Preschool, Askari 11 Campus, Lahore that Zuria Arzoo Irfan 
D/O Irfan Arshad I.D.No.222045 is student of NGS from last two 
years, session starting from August, 2021. Besides this, the 
“Petitioner” produced Exh.R-2, receipts of school fee, Exh.R-4 
School Report May, 2023 and swimming activity for summer camp as 
Mark-A1. Education is the basic element for building the character of 
a minor child and transforming his/her personality and even otherwise 
no material has been produced by the “Respondent No.1” from where 

Writ Petition No.452 of 2024 
Writ Petition No.2050 of 2024  
 
 
 
 
 
 
          10 
it can be seen that the “minor” got education from ASE International 
School Bahria, Rawalpindi.  
16. 
So far as the question of shifting of the “Petitioner” from 
Rawalpindi to Lahore is concerned, it was held by the Additional 
District Judge, Rawalpindi that the Petitioner shifted his residence on 
18.02.2021 and this observation was merely based on an order dated 
17.07.2021 that was passed on an application of the “Petitioner” 
regarding lack of territorial jurisdiction of the Guardian Court at 
Rawalpindi. Record is indicative of the fact that the “Respondent 
No.1” filed petition under Section 25 of the “Act” before the 
Guardian Court, Rawalpindi on 16.01.2021 mentioning the address of 
the Petitioner as “House No.440, Street No.15, Sector F, Phase 8, 
Bahria Town, Rawalpindi”; reply of the same was submitted by the 
“Petitioner” on 19.02.2022 taking specific objection under 
preliminary objection No.1 that the “minor” was residing at Lahore 
with the “Petitioner” since 15.10.2020 and that guardian court had no 
territorial jurisdiction at Rawalpindi. Before filing of the reply of main 
guardian petition, the “Petitioner” moved an application for returning 
of main guardian petition due lack of territorial jurisdiction on the 
grounds that the “minor” was residing with him at House No.107-B-
II, Block-M, Gulberg-III, Lahore and that the “Petitioner” had 
already filed application under Section 7 of the “Act” for appointment 
of the guardian of the “minor” where the “Respondent No.1” was 
appearing and pursing the case. However, the Family Court, 
Rawalpindi opined the date of shifting of the “Petitioner” as 
18.02.2021 on the basis of some rent agreement allegedly executed 
between the “Petitioner” and the house owner namely Tariq Nadeem 
but the said rent agreement was neither mentioned in the main 
guardian petition nor produced during the course of evidence rather 
the “Petitioner” during his cross-examination deposed and admitted it 
correct that the agreement deed of Bahria Town house Rawalpindi 
was in the name of his first wife namely Navira Arzo. Interestingly, 
when order and decree dated 20.07.2023 was assailed by the 

Writ Petition No.452 of 2024 
Writ Petition No.2050 of 2024  
 
 
 
 
 
 
          11 
“Respondent No.1”, she mentioned address of the “Petitioner” as 
“House No.440, 107/B/Block, M, Gulberg-III, Lahore” meaning 
thereby the “Petitioner” was residing at Lahore after the death of 
mother of the “minor” and if it was not so, then why the “Respondent 
No.1” did not mention the address that was previously mentioned in 
the main guardian petition.   
17. 
The tenor of evidence produced by the “Respondent No.1” 
shows that custody of the “minor” is mainly claimed on the ground 
that the “Petitioner” contracted second marriage and on the 
touchstone of preferential right under Muslim Personal Law being 
maternal grandmother. Law is well settled that mere contracting 
second marriage of father or mother is not the sole criterion to 
determine the question of custody of the minor child. The Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in the case of SHABANA NAZ versus MUHAMMAD 
SALEEM (2014 SCMR 343), while dealing with this issue has very 
elaborately outlined the factors disqualifying the mother and father 
from the custody of minor in the following words :- 
“8. 
It may be noted that in terms of section 7 
of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 (the 
Act), the paramount consideration for the 
Court in making the order of appointment of 
guardian of minor is that it should be satisfied 
that it is for the welfare of minor. Although it is 
an established law that father is a natural 
guardian of his minor child/children but indeed 
the Court has to be satisfied while appointing 
the father as a guardian that the welfare of 
minor lies in the fact that he be appointed as a 
guardian and the custody of minor be delivered 
accordingly. There are many factors, which 
may not entitle the father to the custody of 
minor and some of the factors could be, where 
the father is habitually involved in crimes or is 
a drug or alcohol addict, maltreats his 
child/children, does not have a capacity or 
means to maintain and provide for the healthy 
bringing up of his child/children or where the 
father deliberately omits and fails in meeting 
his obligation to maintain his child/children. 
The factors noted above are not exhaustive and 

Writ Petition No.452 of 2024 
Writ Petition No.2050 of 2024  
 
 
 
 
 
 
          12 
they may also not be considered as conclusive 
for that each case has to be decided on its own 
merit in keeping with the only and only 
paramount consideration of welfare of minor”.  
 
18. 
Regarding the second fundamental ground taken by the 
“Respondent No.1” on account of preferential right being maternal 
grandmother as per principle of Muslim personal law, suffice is to 
observe that entitlement as per Muslim personal law is not the sole 
ground for granting custody of a minor to either side rather the 
determining principle to rule the question of custody of a minor in 
favour of any side is the question of welfare of minor. The Supreme 
Court in Raja MUHAMMAD OWAIS versus Mst. NAZIA JABEEN and 
others (2022 SCMR 2123) has also laid down the same principle in 
the following manner:- 
“These provisions and the principles of 
Mohammdan Law have been examined by this 
Court in several judgments where it has held 
that the conditions contained in Paras 352 and 
354 of Mullah's Mohammadan Law are not 
absolute and are subject to the welfare of the 
child”. 
 
  
Similarly, the Supreme Court of Pakistan in MEHMOOD 
AKHTAR versus DISTRICT JUDGE ATTOCK and 2 others  
(2004 SCMR 1839) categorically laid down that entitlement to have 
custody of a minor in accordance with the Muslim Personal Law is 
not the sole and ultimate criteria for granting custody rather it is 
qualified and dependent upon the determinative factor of welfare of 
the minor. The Supreme Court of Pakistan in FIRDOUS IQBAL 
versus SHIFAAT ALI (2000 SCMR 838) also examined the question 
of entitlement of custody from the perspective of provisions of 
Muslim Personal Law as contained in Muhammdan Law by 
D.F.Mulla and held that notwithstanding the right for custody of 
minor under the personal law, this right is always subject to the 
welfare of the minor which is the paramount consideration for 

Writ Petition No.452 of 2024 
Writ Petition No.2050 of 2024  
 
 
 
 
 
 
          13 
determining the question of custody of minor. Likewise, in Mst. 
SEEMA CHOUDHARY versus AHSAN ASHRAF SHEIKH (PLD 2003 
SC 877) the Supreme Court has held that notwithstanding the right of 
mother or father for the custody of male or female child under the 
personal law, the predominant consideration in determining the 
question of custody of minor is always the welfare of the minor  
       "There is no cavil to the proposition that 
notwithstanding the right of the mother or 
father for the custody of male or female child 
under the personal law, the predominant 
consideration in determining the question of 
custody of minor is always the welfare of the 
minor....." 
 
19.  
It is well established from the above-referred judgments that 
the preferential right to claim custody of a minor in accordance with 
Para 353 and 355 of Mohammdan Law by D.F. Mulla is not the sole 
criteria rather it is always dependent upon the primary consideration 
of welfare of child. From that standpoint, now the question of custody 
of the minor is to be determined. The “Petitioner” is real father of the 
“minor” who had the custody of the “minor” from the last almost 
four years after the death of her mother. On the other hand, the 
“Respondent No.1”, who filed the petition for obtaining custody of 
the “minor” is an old lady of about 80 years of age, who does not 
enjoy good health and as such is in no physical condition to look after 
the person and affairs of the “minor” by herself. Even in her petition 
for custody before the learned Guardian Judge, she has categorically 
stated that her real unmarried daughter is living with her and she can 
look after the minor in a proper manner. Plainly, the “Respondent 
No.1” has not stated or claimed to have the capacity to look after the 
“minor” by herself rather she named her real unmarried daughter to 
be of proper help in this regard. It cannot be lost sight that the 
“Respondent No.1” even did not appear before the learned Guardian 
Court to depose in favour of her petition rather the said daughter

          14 
of the Respondent No.1. On 17.06.2023, an application for rejection 
of her power of attorney and for summoning the “Respondent No.1”, 
being petitioner, in person was dismissed by the guardian court vide 
order dated 22.02.2023. It is pertinent to note that in the said 
application, it was well mentioned that the “Petitioner” being an old 
lady suffered minor cardiac attack and because of her health condition 
she appointed her daughter as her special attorney. This is clearly 
suggestive of the fact that the “Respondent No.1” is an old lady with 
poor health condition, which even debarred her from appearing before 
the Court to lead evidence in support of her own petition and even the 
appeal filed before the lower Appellate Court against the judgment of 
Guardian Court that was filed by the “Respondent No.1” through the 
same attorney, which clearly shed light that her physical state 
rendered her incapable for participating in the proceedings in personal 
capacity and further reflective of the fact that she was dependent upon 
her unmarried daughter for carrying out all affairs of her life. During 
cross-examination the PW-1, being attorney of the “Respondent 
No.1” admitted that the age of petitioner is 79 years and further 
admitted it as correct that she tendered application on her behalf that 
she cannot appear before the court due to health issues, This Court in 
GHULAM MUSTAFA Versus SHAMIM AKHTAR and 2 others (2017 
YLR Note 45) set aside the order of the lower Appellate Court 
wherein the custody of minor daughter was given to the grandmother 
and custody of minor son was allowed to be remained with the father 
and held the father is entitled to have custody of his daughter against 
the maternal grandmother who was an old lady and was suffering 
from blood pressure. The relevant portion of the judgment reads as 
under: 
Being father of minors, the petitioner/father 
is also a natural guardian and it is more 
natural for the children to share their joys 
and worries with their natural parents. 
Although, 
respondent 
No.1/maternal 
grandmother has the preferential right to the 
custody of minor/daughter under personal 

Writ Petition No.452 of 2024 
Writ Petition No.2050 of 2024  
 
 
 
 
 
 
          15 
law but paramount consideration is the 
welfare of the minors. In a case reported as 
"Mst. Seema Chaudhry and another v. Ahsan 
Ashraf Sheikh and others" (PLD 2003 SC 
877), the Honourable Apex Court has held 
that:-- 
       "There is no cavil to the proposition that 
notwithstanding the right of the mother or 
father for the custody of male or female child 
under the personal law, the predominant 
consideration in determining the question of 
custody of minor is always the welfare of the 
minor....." 
 
20. 
In the instant case, granting the custody of minor to the 
“Respondent No.1” will amount to handing the “minor” over to her 
maternal aunt for the purposes of everything because the maternal 
grandmother is already dependent on her and even not in a physical 
state of health to appear before the court for evidence or to file appeal 
before the learned lower appellate court. On the other hand, the 
“Petitioner” is real father and as such natural guardian of the minor, 
who is physically available to minor as well as financially capable to 
look after and raise her in an adequate manner and provide for a 
comfortable life. He is also not residing in foreign country for 
occupation, which could have left the minor to the mercy of 
stepmother but he is all available for the “minor”. In contrast to ailing 
and old maternal grandmother, who is dependent upon her daughter 
for everything, the “Petitioner” being real father of the “minor” can 
certainly look after her in a more proper way. Concerning the 
approaching age of puberty and necessity of a female elder to guide 
the minor through that phase of physical and emotional state of life, 
the presence of stepmother is available in the house of “Petitioner” 
against whom only general allegations have been levelled by the 
“Respondent No.1” but no specific incident or accusation has been 
alleged to suggest a well discernable inference about her being 
inimical against the “minor”. Certainly the stepmother cannot be 

Writ Petition No.452 of 2024 
Writ Petition No.2050 of 2024  
 
 
 
 
 
 
          16 
equivalent to real mother but when destiny has taken the “minor” to a 
cross-path of having real father on one side without having any 
children from the second wife and an 80 years old maternal 
grandmother with physically compromised state of health on the 
other, a real and willing parent, not declared unfit in any evident 
manner, seems more suitable for the “minor” to lead her through the 
path of her life then the maternal grandmother who is dependent on 
others to beat the path of her own life. It is not the contesting sides 
whose suitability is a question for determination before the Court but 
it is always the spectrum of welfare and best interest of the minor 
which guides the court to decide between the aspiring parties. Similar 
view has been expressed by the Supreme Court in the latest judgment 
SHAISTA HABIB Versus MUHAMMAD ARIF HABIB and others 
(PLD 2024 Supreme Court 629) wherein the court ruled as under: 
“The overarching principle in cases 
involving the question of custody and 
visitation rights of the parents is, therefore, 
determination of the welfare of the child, 
i.e. to ascertain a course that would serve 
the best interest of the child”.  
 
21.  
It is evident from the record that both the parties have leveled 
severe allegations against each other that is only because of getting 
share of properties/amount of the mother of the “minor”. The 
“Respondent No.1” in order to prove the conduct of the “Petitioner” 
relied on WhatsApp screen shots (Exh.P.4) of physical torture to 
mother of the “minor” who ultimately died on 04.09.2020 and murder 
case was also registered against the Petitioner in which he was 
acquitted by the competent court of law and the same has been 
admitted by the attorney of the “Respondent No.1” during cross 
examination. Her depositions read as: 
“We filed a petition for custody of the minor 
against the Irfan Arshad/respondent; we 

Writ Petition No.452 of 2024 
Writ Petition No.2050 of 2024  
 
 
 
 
 
 
          17 
lodged FIR against the respondent on 
14.12.2021”. 
 
  
Further deposed that 
“The four persons named in the FIR who 
were present in the incident were Irfan 
Arshad husband of the victim, Imran Arshad 
brother of Irfan Arshad, Huma Imran sister in 
law of Irfan and Ahmad Imran nephew of 
respondent Irfan Arshad. It is correct that all 
the persons were named in the FIR had been 
acquitted”.  
 
22. 
Record is evident of the fact that the mother of the “minor” 
was died on 04.09.2020, custody petition was filed on 16.01.2021 and 
interestingly F.I.R. was lodged on 14.12.2021 in which the 
“Petitioner” and his other family members have already been 
acquitted by competent court of law. Hence, such kind of allegation 
cannot be used against the “Petitioner” as of a bad character to get the 
custody of the “minor”. This Court in RIZWAN ALI SAYAL versus 
FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN etc. (PLD 2024 Lahore 54) has 
elaborated the principal of honorable acquittal and hold that  
“As far as argument of an honorable 
acquittal is concerned, the Court is of the 
view that all acquittals including acquittal 
on compromise are honorable for the reason 
that the prosecution has not succeeded to 
prove their cases against the accused on the 
strength of evidence of unimpeachable 
character. There can be no acquittals, which 
may be said to be dishonorable and the law 
has not drawn any distinction between any 
types of acquittals. Reliance is placed on 
“DR. 
MUHAMMAD 
ISLAM 
versus 
GOVERNMENT OF NWFP, etc.” (1998 
SCMR 1993). The Respondent No.5 was 
acquitted by the Judicial magistrate vide 
order dated 14.12.2006 and this order of 
acquittal was upheld by the Additional 
Sessions Judge, Sargodha vide order dated 
08.03.2008. It shall, therefore, be presumed 
that the allegations leveled against him are 
baseless as, he has not been declared guilty. 
In presence of above meaning of "acquittal" 

Writ Petition No.452 of 2024 
Writ Petition No.2050 of 2024  
 
 
 
 
 
 
          18 
the appellant is held to have committed no 
offence because the competent criminal 
courts have cleared him from an accusation 
or charge of crime. Moreover, once a 
person was acquitted by trial court, said 
person would stand shorn of stigma of any 
allegation and he would have to be deemed 
thereafter as innocent and having not 
committed any such crime. If acquittal of 
accused is not assailed before higher forum, 
such acquittal earned by accused from trial 
court, on whatsoever basis, would attain 
finality and pandora box of allegations 
could not be re-opened or used against him. 
In short, acquittal is an acquittal simpliciter 
and, must entail upon all consequences of 
pure acquittal. Reliance is placed on 
“MUMTAZ ALI SHAH versus CHAIRMAN, 
PAKISTAN 
TELECOMMUNICATION 
COMPANY LTD., H.Q., ISLAMABAD and 6 
others” (PLD 2002 Supreme Court 1060). 
Additionally, order of acquittal of accused 
shall erase, efface, obliterate and wash 
away his alleged or already adjudged guilt 
in the matter apart from leading to setting 
aside of his sentence or punishment, if any. 
Reliance is placed on “SUO MOTU CASE 
NO. 03 OF 2017” (PLD 2018 Supreme 
Court 703)”. 
 
23. 
So far as the observation of the Additional District Judge, 
Rawalpindi to the extent that the “Petitioner” operated bank account 
of mother of the “minor” and withdrew and transferred money 
without getting the succession certificate is concerned, learned 
counsel for the “Petitioner” stated that the “Petitioner” is a Chemical 
Engineer by profession who worked in Saudi Arabia from where he 
used to send money directly in the bank account of the mother of the 
“minor” from where she purchased the properties in her name and in 
this regard the “Petitioner” also filed suit for benami transaction 
which is still pending. Whereas the counsel for the “Respondent 
No.1” rebutted this argument and stated that the “Petitioner” filed 
suit for getting declaration of legal heirs just to grab the assets of the 
mother of the “minor”. Be that as it may, the litigation between the 

Writ Petition No.452 of 2024 
Writ Petition No.2050 of 2024  
 
 
 
 
 
 
          19 
parties is still pending adjudication and at this stage, this Court will 
refrain from passing any observation, which may otherwise prejudice 
the case of either side. Considering the facts and circumstances and 
by perusing the available record, the Court observes that absolutely 
nothing has been alleged against “Petitioner” which could 
disqualify or disentitle him from custody of the “minor”. It is 
admitted fact that “Petitioner” is Chemical Engineer and 
financially sound and can better look after and educate his daughter 
and thus does not suffer from any disqualification envisaged by 
law. Furthermore, the “Petitioner” right from inception is 
vigorously pursuing the remedies to obtain the custody of his 
daughter. Whereas the “Respondent No.1” (maternal grandmother) 
is aged about 80 years and in bad health having no source of 
income. The factum of ailment of the “Respondent No.1” is admitted 
by Humaira Iram, special attorney during her cross examination by 
stating that “she has problems of old age and other health issues”. 
The said “Respondent No.1” is fully dependent on her daughters, 
who are working ladies and most of the time they remained at their 
job places and one of them converted from Islam to Bahai Religion. 
Moreover, the “minor” is studying at Lahore after shifting from 
Rawalpindi to Lahore on 15.10.2020 and in this situation, she is 
getting proper study at NGS Education System, Askari II.  
24. 
So far as order dated 02.07.2024 passed in W.P.No.2050 of 
2024 is concerned whereby the Executing Court, Rawalpindi handed 
over the custody to the “Respondent No.1” till the decision of instant 
petition. It is noted that when the “Petitioner” challenged 
consolidated judgment and decree dated 30.01.2024 before this Court, 
the Court vide order dated 13.02.2024 passed status quo order qua 
custody of the “minor”. Instant petition was dismissed for  
non-prosecution on 13.06.2024; restoration of which was filed 
through C.M.No.1249 of 2024 wherein the Court on 27.06.2024 
issued notice to the “Respondent No.1”. The Court vide order dated 
02.07.2024 again stayed the proceedings before the Executing Court. 

Writ Petition No.452 of 2024 
Writ Petition No.2050 of 2024  
 
 
 
 
 
 
          20 
The “Respondent No.1” filed execution petition on 06.02.2024 for 
execution of consolidated judgment and decree dated 30.01.2024 
wherein the Executing Court appointed bailiff for production of the 
“minor” on 14.02.2024. On the said date, warrant under Section 100 
of the “Cr.PC” were issued for 04.03.2024 and thereafter execution 
petition remained pending till 06.06.2024 for awaiting the order of 
this Court. On 06.06.2024, the Executing Court was on leave and it 
was fixed for 11.07.2024. In the meanwhile, on 25.06.2024, the 
“Respondent No.1” filed application for early hearing of execution 
petition which was taken up on the same day and the Executing Court, 
Rawalpindi observed that “the respondent assailed the judgment vide 
writ petition No.452 of 2024 at Hon’ble Lahore High Court but the 
same was dismissed due to non-prosecution vide order dated 
13.06.2024. The execution petition has already been adjourned for 
11.07.2024 in wait of order of Hon’ble Court. The custody of the 
minor has been shifted to the petitioner and there is apprehension of 
removal of minor from the jurisdiction of this court, it is therefore 
warrants u/s 100 Cr.PC are issued to recover the minor and produce 
her in the court even prior to the fixed date in execution petition”. 
Besides, special attorney of the “Respondent No.1” also filed habeas 
petition under Section 491 of the “Cr.PC” for recovery of the 
“minor” before the Additional District Judge, Lahore  who vide order 
dated 29.06.2024 allowed above said petition and handed over the 
custody of the “minor” to special attorney of the “Respondent No.1” 
with direction to produce the “minor” before the Executing Court at 
Rawalpindi on 02.07.2024. In the said order, the Executing Court 
observed as under: 
“On 01.07.2024 the petitioner produced the 
minor before this court under apprehension 
of threatening of dire consequences from the 
judgment debtor/respondent; the petitioner 
Zainab Noor was allowed to carry the 
custody. Today, minor has been produced on 
the request of counsel for the respondent who 
produces the order of Hon'ble Lahore High 

Writ Petition No.452 of 2024 
Writ Petition No.2050 of 2024  
 
 
 
 
 
 
          21 
Court that the proceedings before Executing 
Court shall remain stayed”. 
Underlining for emphasis 
 
25. 
The above said order clearly indicates that order dated 
02.07.2024 of this Court was produced before the Executing Court, 
Rawalpindi, which instead of complying with the said order, 
proceeded to continue execution proceedings, which is highly 
objectionable, hence order dated 02.07.2024 is set aside being not 
sustainable in the eyes of law.  
26. 
On the comparative analysis of both the findings, the Court 
feel no hesitation to observe that the Additional District Judge, while 
exercising his appellate jurisdiction has grossly misread the evidence 
and wrongly interfered with the well-reasoned findings of the learned 
Family Judge. The constitutional jurisdiction vested in terms of 
Article 199 of the “Constitution” casts a duty upon the Court to curb 
the illegality or gross misreading committed by any of the courts 
below, while determining the rights of the parties. Reliance is placed 
on Hammad Ali Khan and others versus Mst. Sadia Akbar and others 
(2024 MLD 1445) wherein this Court held: 
“Ordinarily, the High Court does not re-examine 
evidence or disturb findings of fact, however; it can 
interfere if the findings are based on non-reading or 
misreading 
of 
evidence, 
erroneous 
assumptions, 
misapplication of law, excess or abuse of jurisdiction, 
and arbitrary exercise of powers. Thus, this court can 
correct such errors as this Court’s constitutional 
jurisdiction is meant to supervise and serve justice, 
allowing it to correct any wrongs committed contrary to 
evidence and the law.” 
 
The “Petitioner” has successfully established that exercise of 
appellate jurisdiction by the learned Additional District Judge is the 
result of in application of judicious mind and the impugned 
consolidated judgment is the outcome of gross misreading and non-
reading of evidence. 

Writ Petition No.452 of 2024 
Writ Petition No.2050 of 2024  
 
 
 
 
 
 
          22 
27. 
For the foregoing reasons, both the writ petitions are allowed 
and consequently, consolidated judgment & decree passed by the 
Additional District Judge, Rawalpindi and order dated 02.07.2024 
passed by the Family Executing Court are set-aside, as a sequel 
thereof, the judgment passed by the Senior Civil Judge (Family 
Division), Rawalpindi is restored with no order as to costs. 
28. 
Before parting with the judgment, it is observed that the 
Family Executing Court has prime facie exceeded its limits and 
committed gross misconduct, while passing order dated 02.07.2024 
during the pendency of this writ petition filed against the judgments at 
variance in which stay order was also issued, especially when it 
reproduced this very fact in its aforesaid order, which speaks volumes. 
Therefore, the District Judge, Rawalpindi is directed to probe into the 
matter and submit a comprehensive report to this Court through 
Additional Registrar (Judicial) within a month for further necessary 
action/proceedings.
