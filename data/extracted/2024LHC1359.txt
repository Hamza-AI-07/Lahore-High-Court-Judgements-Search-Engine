MIRZA VIQAS RAUF, J. This petition has a chequered  
history at its back. Respondent No.1 (hereinafter referred to as 
“respondent”) was owner of the land measuring 24-kanal 05-marla 
bearing Survey No.1222 situated at Tench  Bhatta Tehsil & District 
Rawalpindi within the limits of Cantonment Board. Out of the said 
land, land measuring 02-kanal 02-marla was utilized by the 
petitioner-Board for construction of Dhari Hassnabad Tulsa Road 
and Harley Street to Tulsa Road through its resolution. The owner of 
the land/“respondent” was, however, assured that he shall be 
provided alternate land for the land utilized in the road. A Surrender 
Deed was executed between the “respondent” and Cantonment 
Board on 24th June, 1987 whereby it was agreed that following land 
would be given to the “respondent” in lieu of land utilized for 
construction of road:-

Total: 12,153 sft 
2.  
On failure by the petitioner-Board to fulfill the commitment, 
the “respondent” instituted a suit for specific performance, 
possession and recovery of compensation. The suit was though 
resisted but it was decreed vide judgment dated 20th November, 
1990. The petitioner-Board challenged the judgment and decree of 
the trial court up to the Supreme Court of Pakistan but remained 
unsuccessful. This followed the execution proceedings wherein the 
petitioner-Board filed an objection petition but it was dismissed 
through order dated 08th March, 2014. Feeling aggrieved, the 
petitioner-Board preferred an appeal before the learned Additional 
District Judge, Rawalpindi but the appeal was also dismissed through 
order dated 05th January, 2015, hence this petition under Section 115 
of the Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908) (hereinafter referred to 
as “CPC”). 
3.  
Learned counsel for the petitioner-Board contended that the 
Executing Court travelled beyond the decree. He added that in order 
to resist the execution proceedings, the petitioner-Board filed an 
objection petition. It is contended that without examining the 
objections raised by the petitioner-Board, the Executing Court 
discarded the same mechanically. Learned counsel submitted that the 
Appellate Court while confirming the order of the Executing Court 
committed material irregularity and as such impugned order is not 
tenable. 
4.  
Conversely, learned counsel for the “respondent” submitted 
that the execution proceedings have unnecessarily been hampered by 
the petitioner-Board. He added that objection petition was rightly 
dismissed being misconceived. 
5.  
Heard, record perused.

6.  
As the petition in hand is arising out of execution proceedings 
so it would not be apt to go into rigmarole of the factual resume. It is 
an admitted fact that “respondent” was owner of land measuring 
24-kanal 05-marla bearing survey No.1222 situated in the revenue 
estate of Tench, Dhari Hassanabad, old Rawalpindi, now Chaklala 
Cantt Rawalpindi. The land was utilized by the petitioner-Board for 
construction of a road and bridge leading from Harley Street to Tahli 
Mohri. The controversy was amicably negotiated by the 
petitioner-Board with the “respondent” in furtherance of which he 
applied for alternate land. The application of the “respondent” was 
placed before the Board in its meeting held on 29th June, 1985. It was 
resolved in the Board’s meeting that alternate land be allotted to the 
“respondent” in lieu of land measuring 02-kanal 02-marla on 
payment of formal rent and without premium. The Cantonment 
Executive Officer was authorized to process the case and refer the 
matter to the competent authority. The “respondent” thus 
surrendered his land in favour of the petitioner-Board through 
Surrender Deed No.No.4969 dated 24th June, 1987. In furtherance 
whereof, the Ministry of Defence, Government of Pakistan, 
Rawalpindi, vide letter No.75/230/Lands/87/3524/D-12/ML&C, 
dated 18th October, 1987 issued a sanction for exchange of land 
measuring 02-kanal 02-marla with land of equal measurement 
situated at Khadim Hussain Road, Rawalpindi inter alia on the 
following conditions:- 
i).  
Acceptance of exchange of land by the Cantonment 
Board; and 
ii).  
Lease of land measuring 02-kanals 13-marlas in 
favour of Respondent No.1 by way of private treaty in 
Schedule VIII of the CLA Rules, 1937. 
7.  
The conditional sanction was conveyed to the “respondent” 
for fulfillment of the conditions contained therein but it was not 
accepted by him and ultimately he instituted a suit for specific 
performance of the agreement alongwith compensation, which was 
decreed vide judgment dated 20th November, 1990 in the following 
manner:- 
 
 
 

Civil Revision No.1004/2015 
 
-4- 
 
“RELIEF 
25.  
As a result to be above findings, the suit of the 
plaintiffs for the specific performance of the contract is 
decreed. The plaintiffs have already performed their part of 
the contract by surrendering their land in favour of the 
defendants, therefore, the defendants are hereby ordered to 
give their land to the plaintiffs within three months of this order 
and if they will not do like such then the plaintiffs are entitled 
to get the possession of their land and they are also entitled 
to Rs.;2,11,200/- from the defendants as ground rent 
calculated upto the institution of the suit and further ground 
rent of their land till the defendants would demolish the road 
and bridge from the land of the plaintiffs. The defendants are 
burdened for the costs of this suit.” 
8.  
Feeling dissatisfied, an appeal was preferred by the 
petitioner-Board (Federation of Pakistan) before the learned 
Additional District Judge, Rawalpindi but it was not acceded too and 
was dismissed with costs through judgment and decree dated 22nd  
October, 2004. This followed Civil Revision No.35 of 2005 before 
this Court which was also dismissed vide judgment dated 18th July, 
2013. The petitioner-Board then filed C.P.L.A. No.1773 of 2013 
before the Supreme Court of Pakistan which too was dismissed 
through judgment dated 07th November, 2013, relevant extract from 
the same is reproduced:- 
“4.  
It is an admitted fact that the Respondents owned 2 
Kanals and 2 Marlas of land. It is also an admitted fact that 
the said pieces of land has been utilized by the Petitioners. It 
is also in the evidence that the Petitioners were agreed to 
compensate the Respondents by allotting an alternate pieces 
of land. It is in the above perspective that the suit was decreed 
by the learned Trial Court. The said finding of fact has been 
affirmed by the learned First Appellate Court and the Revision 
Petition filed by the present Petitioners has also been 
dismissed. There can be no escape from the fact that the land 
of the Respondents has been taken over and utilized by the 
Petitioners. If they are unable to give alternate land without 
premium as committed by them then obviously the 
Respondents are entitled to the restoration of land owned by 
them. In the circumstances, no exception can be taken to the 
Judgments and Decrees of the learned Courts below and the 
Impugned Judgment of the learned High Court.” 
9.  
It appears that petitioner-Board then filed an application under 
Section 12(2) of “CPC” before Supreme Court of Pakistan on the 
ground that judgment and decree dated 20th November, 1990 passed 
by the Civil Court, Rawalpindi is the result of fraud and 
misrepresentation and as such decision of the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan dated 07th November, 2013 is not maintainable. By way of 

Civil Revision No.1004/2015 
 
-5- 
 
order dated 30th August, 2019, the application was dismissed with 
following observations:- 
“14.  
The learned counsel for the applicant has not been 
able to convince us through any evidence or material on 
record that the Respondents have committed any fraud or 
representation that may persuade us to recall or set aside the 
judgments and decrees in favour of the Respondents and 
judgment of this Court dated 07.11.2013. Further, if at all any 
such material was available with the Applicants they could 
have placed the same on record after seeking permission to 
do so by moving an application for production of additional 
evidence. This could have been done at any stage of the 
proceedings. That this was not done or even attempted to be 
done at any stage furnishes sufficient grounds to presume that 
no such evidence or material is available with the Applicant.” 
10.  
The matter did not end here. The petitioner-Board filed Civil 
Review Petition No.572 of 2019 but it was disposed of as not pressed 
through order dated 07th February, 2020. For ready reference and 
convenience, the same is reproduced:- 
“…After arguing the matter at some length, the learned 
counsel for the petitioner does not want to press this petition 
in order to initiate proceeding to recover the land which was 
surrendered to it by the respondents in lieu of the alternate 
land allotted to them. This review petition is, therefore, 
disposed of as not pressed.” 
11.  
In the above backdrop, while adverting to the objection 
petition, moved by the petitioner-Board during the execution 
proceedings, it is noticed that objection petition is founded on the 
ground that during proceedings of the execution, it transpired to the 
petitioner-Board that “respondent” succeeded in getting transfer of 
the land of the Federation in his favour through registered sale deed 
and possession inconsequence thereof has also been delivered to 
him, which is against the terms of the decree and as such, it is duty 
of the learned Executing Court to inquire how registered sale deed 
was got executed against the spirit of the decree and matter of 
mutation is yet to be decided through the suit filed by the 
“respondent”. Before moving further, it would not be out of context 
to mention here that initially in the suit, alongwith Cantonment 
Board, the Federal Government and other entities were also party and 
decree was directed against all of them. The objection petition at the 
face of it is vexatious and baseless. It appears that the 

Civil Revision No.1004/2015 
 
-6- 
 
petitioner-Board after exhausting all available remedies and failing 
to achieve its design, moved objection petition before the learned 
Executing Court as a last resort to frustrate the process of the 
execution in terms of decree passed way back in the year 1990 so as 
to deprive the decree holder from the fruits of the decree. This is 
classic case demonstrating that actual misery of the decree holder 
starts with the execution. Needless to observer that it is not expected 
from a public office/public officer to carve means for frustrating the 
process of law. I feel no hesitation to observe that the objection 
petition was moved without any reasonable cause to thwart the 
execution process. On dismissal of the objection petition, it was 
expected that the petitioner-Board should realize its duty and not to 
indulge in unnecessary litigation with the public, who has a 
confidence and trust that being the public body, Cantonment Board 
shall guard its rights. After dismissal of objection petition, an appeal 
was filed before the learned Additional District Judge, Rawalpindi 
which too was dismissed and rightly so. Revisional jurisdiction 
under Section 115 of “CPC” can only be invoked in the eventualities 
mentioned in the said provision of law. It cannot be resorted to in an 
omnibus fashion. This petition was filed way back in the year 2015 
and it remained pending for the last about nine years adding burden 
to the docket of the Court on the one end and on the other consumed 
a  lot of time, reserved for the matters requiring attention of this court 
in actual. 
12.  
In somewhat similar circumstances, in the case of Qazi 
NAVEED UL ISLAM versus DISTRICT JUDGE, GUJRAT and 
others (PLD 2023 Supreme Court 298), Supreme Court of Pakistan 
has held as under:- 
“11. 
Such frivolous, vexatious and speculative litigation 
unduly burdens the courts giving artificial rise to pendency of 
cases which in turn clogs the justice system and delays the 
resolution of genuine disputes. Such litigation is required to 
be rooted out of the system and one of the ways to curb such 
practice of instituting frivolous and vexatious cases is by 
imposing of costs under Order XXVIII, Rule 3 of the Supreme 
Court Rules, 1980 ("Rules"). The spectre of being made liable 
to pay actual costs should be such as to make every litigant 
think twice before putting forth a vexatious claim or defence 
before the Court. These costs in an appropriate case can be 

Civil Revision No.1004/2015 
 
-7- 
 
over and above the nominal costs which include costs of the 
time spent by the successful party, the transportation and 
lodging, if any, or any other incidental cost, besides the 
amount of the court fee, process fee and lawyer's fee paid in 
relation to the litigation. Imposition of costs in frivilous and 
vexatious cases meets the requirement of fair trial under 
Article 10A of the Constitution, as it not only discourages 
frivilous claims or defences brought to the court house but 
also absence of such cases allows more court time for the 
adjudication of genuine claims. It also incentivizes the litigants 
to adopt alternative dispute resolution (ADR) processes and 
arrive at a settlement rather than rushing to courts. Costs lay 
the foundation for expeditious justice and promote a smart 
legal system that enhances access to justice by entertaining 
genuine claims. The purpose of awarding costs at one level is 
to compensate the successful party for the expenses incurred 
to which he has been subjected and at another level to be an 
effective tool to purge the legal system of frivolous, vexatious 
and speculative claims and defences. In a nutshell costs 
enourage alternative dispute resolution; settlements between 
the parties; and reduces unnecessary burden off the courts, 
so that they can attend to genuine claims. Costs are a weapon 
of offence for the plaintiff with a just claim to present and a 
shield to the defendant who has been unfairly brought into 
court.” 
Reliance to this effect can also be placed on ZAKIR MEHMOOD 
versus SECRETARY, MINISTRY OF DEFENCE (D.P), PAKISTAN 
SECRETARIATE, RAWALPINDI and others (2023 SCMR 960) and 
CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY, CDA through Chairman, 
CDA, Islamabad versus AHMED MURTAZA and another (2013 
SCMR 61). 
13.  
For the foregoing reasons, this petition is dismissed being 
frivolous and vexatious with special costs of Rs.5,00,000/- to be 
deposited by the petitioner-Board in any approved Charity within 
one month. In case of failure, it shall be recovered as arrears of land 
revenue.
