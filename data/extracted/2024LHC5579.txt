ARSHAD, 
J. 
Through 
this 
constitutional petition filed under Article 199 of the Constitution of 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the petitioner has called in 
question the validity and legality of judgments/orders of the Courts 
below whereby his application for DNA examination was dismissed 
concurrently.  
2. 
Facts in brevity are that respondent No.3 instituted a suit for 
recovery of her maintenance allowance as well as for her minor son 
namely Sadaqat Hussain. The petitioner appeared before the Court 
and contested the suit by filing written statement in contrast wherein 
he denied the paternity of minor Sadaqat Hussain. He also filed an 
application for DNA examination of the minor by submitting that he 
is not his son. Learned Trial Court, after taking its reply, dismissed 
the same vide order dated 15.03.2023. Feeling aggrieved, the 

W.P. No.22286 of 2023. 
2
petitioner filed an appeal which also met the same fate and dismissed 
by the learned Appellate Court vide judgment dated 29.03.2023. 
Hence, this petition.  
3. 
I have heard learned counsel for the petitioner at length and 
perused the record with his able assistance.  
4. 
It is matter of record that the petitioner contracted marriage 
with the respondent No.3 on 11.01.2018, however, he divorced her 
on 17.08.2018. After the divorce, minor Sadaqat Hussain was born 
on 01.03.2019 i.e. almost 06 ½ months of the dissolution of marriage.  
5. 
The petitioner has not denied the marriage with respondent 
No.3, however, he denied the paternity of minor Sadaqat Hussain. 
He moved the application whereby he prayed for conducting 
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) Test. Each human being has a unique 
DNA pattern, which is acquired by inheriting it from the biological 
parents. DNA can be found in the human body and samples can be 
taken from sliva, skin tissues, blood, hair and semen for establishing 
the DNA matching with the DNA of another human being. By using 
DNA technology, the Courts were in a better position to reach at a 
just conclusion but the question is that whether the petitioner can be 
allowed to get conduct DNA test of the minor and produce the said 
report as evidence in order to challenge the paternity of Sadaqat 
Hussain. 
6. 
As per Article 128 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, a 
child born to a woman during the subsistence of valid marriage or 
within two years after its dissolution is conclusive proof of his 
legitimacy, provided that the woman remains unmarried after the 

W.P. No.22286 of 2023. 
3
divorce. Said fact was regarded as a „conclusive proof‟ and no 
evidence could be admitted to refute the same. For ease of reference, 
Article 128 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, is reproduced as 
under: 
Birth during marriage conclusive proof of legitimacy:  
(1) The fact that any person was born during the continuance of 
a valid marriage between his mother and any man and not 
earlier than the expiration of six lunar months from the date of 
the marriage, or within two years after its dissolution, the 
mother remaining unmarried, shall be conclusive proof that he 
is the legitimate child of that man, unless—  
(a) the husband had refused, or refuses, to own the child ; or  
(b) the child was born after the expiration of six lunar months 
from the date on which the woman had accepted that the period 
of iddat had come to an end.  
(2) Nothing contained in clause (1) shall apply to a non-Muslim 
if it is inconsistent with his faith. 
 
7. 
Said article has been explained by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court 
of Pakistan in a case titled “Ghazala Tehsin Zohra V. Mehr Ghulam 
Dastagir Khan and another” (PLD 2015 Supreme Court 327), as 
under: 
“10. 
We are cognizant of the ramifications and serious 
consequences which will follow if the impugned judgment 
remains a part of our case law as precedent. We, first of all, 
take up for comment the provisions of Article 128 ibid. The 
Article is couched in language which is protective of societal 
cohesion and the values of the community. This appears to be 
the rationale for stipulating affirmatively that a child who is 
born within two years after the dissolution of the marriage 
between his parents (the mother remaining un-married) shall 
constitute conclusive proof of his legitimacy. Otherwise, neither 
the classical Islamic jurists nor the framers of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order could have been oblivious of the scientific fact 
that the normal period of gestation of the human foetus is 

W.P. No.22286 of 2023. 
4
around nine months. That they then extended the presumption of 
legitimacy to two years, in spite of this knowledge, directly 
points towards the legislative intent as well as the societal 
imperative of avoiding controversy in matters of paternity. It is 
in this context that at first glance, clause 1(a) of Article 128 
appears to pose a difficulty. It may be noted that classical 
Islamic Law, which is the inspiration behind the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order (though not incorporated fully) and was 
referred to by learned counsel for the appellant also adheres to 
the same rationale and is driven by the same societal imperative. 
In this regard, it is also worth taking time to reflect on the belief 
in our tradition that on the Day of Judgment, the children of 
Adam will be called out by their mother's name. It shows that 
the Divine Being has, in His infinite wisdom and mercy, taken 
care to ensure that even on a day when all personal secrets 
shall be laid bare the secrets about paternity shall not be delved 
into or divulged.” 
8. 
Article 2(f)(9) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, provides 
that “when one fact is declared by this order to be conclusive proof 
of another, the Court was, on proof of the one fact, regard the other 
as proved and shall not allow evidence to be given for the purpose of 
disproving it”. The stipulation in Article 128 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984 is that the birth of a child within the period 
specified in said Article is conclusive proof that he is a legitimate 
child. Once the relevant facts as to commencement of dissolution of 
marriage and the date of birth of a child within a period envisioned 
in Article 128 are proved and the date of birth is within the period 
specified in Article 128(1), then the Court cannot allow evidence to 
be given for disproving the legitimacy of a child born within the 
aforesaid period.  
 
Article 128 (1)(a) provides that although birth during 
continuance of a valid marriage or within two years after its 

W.P. No.22286 of 2023. 
5
dissolution is a conclusive proof of legitimacy but under certain 
circumstances the husband can disown the paternity of a child. Now, 
the question is when the husband can deny the parentage. Stage of 
such denial is of paramount consideration. Section 02 of the West 
Pakistan Muslim Personal Law (Shariah) Application Act, 1962 (Act 
V of 1962) stipulates that "notwithstanding any custom or usage, in all 
questions regarding ... legitimacy or bastardy ... the rule of decision, 
subject to the provisions of any enactment for the time being in force shall 
be the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) in cases where the parties are 
Muslims". Since both parties are Muslims and section 2 aforesaid 
specifically refers to legitimacy or bastardy, resort must be made to 
the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) for the purpose of reconciling 
what may appear to be conflicting provision of Article 128 of the 
QSO. For this purpose, it is necessary to ascertain the rules of 
Muslim Personal Law when a person denies that he is the 
natural/biological father of children born within the period stipulated 
in Article 128 ibid. The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) is clear and 
well-settled 
on 
the 
subject. 
Firstly, 
it 
provides 
that 
legitimacy/paternity must be denied by the father immediately after 
birth of the child as per Imam Abu Hanifa and within the post natal 
period (maximum of 40 days) after birth of the child as per Imam 
Muhammad and Imam Yousaf. There can be no lawful denial of 
paternity after this stipulated period. The Hedaya, Fatawa-e-Alamgiri 
and other texts are all agreed on this principle of Shariat. 
9. 
In the present case, the petitioner contracted marriage with the 
respondent No.3 on 11.01.2018, however, later on divorced her on 

W.P. No.22286 of 2023. 
6
17.08.2018. Minor Sadaqat Hussain was born on 01.03.2019 i.e. 
almost after 6 ½ months of the dissolution of marriage. Hence, the 
first denial of paternity appearing from the record in the instant case 
is in the written statement furnished by the petitioner on 28.05.2022. 
Therefore, while applying the above referred principles of Muslim 
Personal Law (Shariat) as mandated by the Act V of 1962 the 
petitioner cannot be allowed to deny the legitimacy/paternity of 
Sadaqat Hussain. 
10. 
In Ghazala Tehsin Zohra’s case (referred supra),   the 
appellant Mst. Ghazala Tehsin Zahra who contracted marriage with 
Mehr Ghulam Dastagir Khan (respondent) on 09.08.1997 and from 
the said wedlock a daughter namely Hina Fatima was born on 
21.02.2000 and a son namely Hassan Mujtaba was born on 
09.02.2001; she filed a suit for recovery of maintenance for herself 
and for her two children, the respondent instituted a  declaratory suit 
denying the paternity of the said children and filed an application for 
conducting DNA test to establish his denial of paternity which was 
dismissed by the learned Trial Court, however, Revisional Court 
allowed the same and the said order was also maintained by High 
Court. The Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, while allowing the 
appeal, set aside the verdict of High Court as well as Revisional 
Court, and dismissed the respondent‟s suit while observing as under: 
"13. 
The rationale of the law set out in Article 128 of the 
QSO read with section 2 of Act V of 1962 is quite clear. Both 
statutes ensure (in specified circumstances) an unquestioned 
and unchallengeable legitimacy on the child born within the 
aforementioned period notwithstanding the existence or 
possibility of a fact through scientific evidence. The framers of 

W.P. No.22286 of 2023.

the law or jurists in the Islamic tradition were not unaware 
simpletons lacking in knowledge. The conclusiveness of proof in 
respect of legitimacy of a child was properly thought out and 
quite deliberate. There is a much greater societal objective 
which is served by adhering to the said rules of evidence than 
any purpose confined to the interests of litigating individuals. 
There are many legal provisions in the statute book and rules of 
equity or public policy in our jurisprudence where the interests 
of individuals are subordinated to the larger public interest. In 
our opinion the law does not give a free license to individuals 
and particularly unscrupulous fathers, to make unlawful 
assertions and thus to cause harm to children as well as their 
mothers." 
 
11. 
August Supreme Court of Pakistan in another case titled "Mst. 
Laila Qayyum V. Fawad Qayum and others” (PLD 2019 Supreme 
Court 449) wherein Fawad Qayyum instituted the suit against Mst. 
Laila Qayyum by alleging that she was “an abandoned infant in a local 
hospital” and was adopted by his father and during the pendency of 
said suit he filed an application seeking DNA test to be conducted 
and compared with his DNA. Said application was allowed by the 
Trial Court, however, Appellate Court set-aside the judgment of 
Trial Court; Hon‟ble Peshawar High Court while setting aside 
judgment of the Appellate Court restored the order of Trial Court but 
august Supreme Court of Pakistan allowed the appeal and dismissed 
the suit while observing as under: 
"Learned Mr. Awan is also right in referring to the case of 
Salman Akram Raja wherein it was held that a free lady 
cannot be compelled to give a sample for DNA testing as it 
would violate her liberty. If a sample is forcibly taken from 
Laila to determine her paternity it would violate her liberty, 
dignity and privacy which Article 14 of the Constitution of 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan ("the Constitution") 
guarantees to a free person. The cases of Muhammad Shahid 
Sahil and B. P. Jena referred to by learned Mr. Faisal Khan, 
who represents Fawad, are distinguishable and are also not 

W.P. No.22286 of 2023.

applicable to the present case. In the case of Muhammad 
Shahid Sahil the DNA of a rapist was sought by the victim to 
compare it with the DNA of the child born as a consequence 
of the rape. And in the case of B. P. Jena the Indian Supreme 
Court considered section 112 of the Evidence Act. Section 
112 of the Evidence Act was the precursor of Article 128 of 
the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, however, the wording of the 
two provisions is materially different. In any case, the 
Supreme Court of India observed that, "In a matter where 
paternity of a child is in issue before the court, the use of 
DNA is an extremely delicate and sensitive aspect and that: 
 
DNA in a matter relating to paternity of a child 
should not be directed by the court as a matter of 
course or in routine manner, whenever such a 
request is made. The court has to consider 
diverse aspects including presumption under 
Section 112 of the Evidence Act; pros and cons of 
such order and the test of 'eminent need' whether 
it is not possible for the court to reach the truth 
without use of such test.” 
 
 (B. P. Jena V. Convenor Secretary, Orissa State 
Commission for Women AIR 2010 Supreme Court 
2851)" 
 
12. 
It is for the honour and dignity of women and innocent 
children as also the value placed on the institution of the family, 
that women and blameless children have been granted legal 
protection and a defence against scurrilous stigmatization. It is 
becoming a common practice in our society that whenever a suit for 
recovery of maintenance allowance is filed against a person he 
comes forward to the Court and challenges the legitimacy of the 
child by moving an application requesting for conducting DNA 
analysis of the child. Ethically, questioning the paternity of a child 
during a maintenance suit can be seen as a tactic to evade 
responsibility rather than a legitimate claim based on evidence. It 
often reflects a desire to avoid financial obligations and may be 
motivated by personal animosity or financial concerns. Such practice 
should be discouraged and dealt with an iron hand because 
encouraging such practices would only serve to erode trust in the 

W.P. No.22286 of 2023. 
9
family unit and the legal system that is designed to protect the 
interests of vulnerable children. When a parent questions the 
legitimacy of the child, it creates an atmosphere of doubt and 
insecurity. This practice undermines the child‟s sense of identity, 
dignity, and belonging, which can have long-lasting psychological 
effects. It is crucial that courts focus on the child's needs and 
emotional welfare, rather than allowing a parent to challenge 
paternity without valid justification. The use of DNA tests to 
challenge paternity, while scientifically valid, should not be viewed 
as a tool for harassment or delay in matters of child maintenance.  
13. 
In view of the above, learned Courts below have rightly 
dismissed the application of the petitioner. Learned counsel for the 
petitioner, despite hectic efforts and lengthy arguments, remained 
unable to persuade this Court to interfere in the verdicts of lower 
foras.  
14. 
Upshot of above discussion is that instant petition has no 
force/substance, hence, the same is dismissed with no order as to 
costs.
