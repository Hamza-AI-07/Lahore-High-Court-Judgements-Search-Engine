AHMAD NADEEM ARSHAD, J.    This civil revision is 
directed against the judgments & decrees of the Courts below 
whereby the suit of the respondent No.1 namely Abdul Aziz 
(predecessor of the respondents No.1-a to 1-m) has been decreed 
concurrently.  
2. 
Facts in brevity are that predecessor of the respondents No.1-a 
to 1-m namely Abdul Aziz instituted a suit for declaration and 
permanent injunction on 17.06.1986 and sought declaration to the 

C.R.No.479-D of 2001. 
2
effect that he being sole legal heir of Yousaf s/o Muhammad, allottee 
of the suit property measuring 68 Kanals, as lessee of Jadeed scheme, 
is in possession under cultivation and the defendants (petitioner and 
respondent No.2) have no concern with it as they are not daughters and 
legal heirs of Yousaf; that mutation No.270 dated 22.05.1986, 
whereby the suit property was inherited/alienated to the parties is 
against the facts & law, ex-parte, without notice, without providing 
opportunity of hearing, based upon fraud and collusiveness between 
defendants and revenue officials, therefore, liable to be cancelled and 
having no effect upon his rights and as a consequential relief prayed 
for issuance of injunction that the defendants be restrained from 
incorporating the impugned mutation in the revenue record. He 
maintained in the plaint that suit property was allotted to Yousaf s/o 
Muhammad under Jadeed Scheme which is being cultivated by him 
during the lifetime of Yousaf; that said Yousaf was married to Maryan 
Bibi who was widow of Kallu; that at the time of second marriage she 
brought along with her two daughters namely Zainab Bibi (petitioner) 
and Aimana Bibi (respondent No.2) from the wedlock of her previous 
husband; that said defendants lived in the house of Yousaf along with 
Maryan; that he was the only issue out of the wedlock of Yousaf with 
said Maryan; that he and defendants are not real brother and sisters 
inter-se, therefore, defendants are not entitled to get inheritance from 
the legacy of Yousaf (deceased); that his father died in March, 1986 
and after his death defendant No.1 (petitioner) and his son with the 
help and connivance of the revenue officials got mutated the suit 
property through inheritance mutation No.270 in favour of plaintiff 
and defendants; that defendants got sanctioned the impugned mutation 
through misrepresentation as the defendants are not legal heirs of 
Yousaf and prayed for decree of the suit.  
3. 
The petitioner (defendant No.1) resisted the suit through filing 
contesting written statement by raising certain preliminary objections, 
that the Court has no jurisdiction; that impugned order of sanctioning 

C.R.No.479-D of 2001. 
3
of mutation was not challenged before proper forum; that plaintiff 
came to the court with mala fide; that plaintiff is estopped from his 
words and conduct to institute the suit; that suit is based upon 
collusion and fraud and to deprive her from her legal share; that the 
suit was instituted due to family disputes; that the suit is not 
maintainable in its present form and she is entitled to get special cost 
u/s 35-A of C.P.C. On facts, admitted that suit property was allotted to 
Yousaf under Jadeed scheme who remained owner in possession till 
his death; that defendants are real daughters of Yousaf born from the 
wedlock of Yousaf with Maryan, therefore, the impugned mutation 
was rightly sanctioned in favour of all the legal heirs and prayed for 
dismissal of the suit.   
4. 
Respondent/defendant No.2 conceded the suit while filing 
conceding written statement. Learned Trial Court keeping in view 
divergent pleadings of the parties framed necessary issues and invited 
the parties to produce their respective evidence. After recording 
evidence of the parties, pro & contra oral as well as documentary, 
learned Civil Judge of Trial Court decreed the suit vide judgment & 
decree dated 01.02.2000. Feeling aggrieved, petitioner preferred an 
appeal which was dismissed by the learned Appellate Court via 
judgment & decree dated 06.01.2001. Being dissatisfied, she 
approached this Court through instant Civil Revision.  
5. 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and 
perused the record with their able assistance.  
6. 
Plaintiff claimed that he is the sole legal heir of Yousaf and the 
defendants are not daughters of Yousaf rather they were born from the 
earlier wedlock of Maryan with Kallu, therefore, they are not entitled 
to get inheritance from the legacy of Yousaf, whereas, the defendant 
No.1 claimed herself and defendant No.2 as daughters of Yousaf. 
Learned Trial Court with regard to the said controversy framed issues 
No.1 and 3 as follows: 

C.R.No.479-D of 2001. 
4
ISSUE NO.1. 
“Whether the plaintiff is sole legal heir of Yousaf s/o Muhammad? 
OPP”  
 
 
ISSUE NO.3. 
 “Whether Zainab Bibi and Aimana are the daughters of Kallu who 
was previous husband of (Maryan) wife of Yousaf? OPP 
 
Onus probendi of these issues were placed upon the plaintiff. 
Plaintiff produced Muhammad Siddique s/o Munshi as P.W.1, 
Abdullah s/o Esa as P.W.2 and he examined himself as P.W.3. In 
documentary evidence, he produced copy of mutation No.270 dated 
22.05.1986 as Exh.P.1, copy of record of rights for the year 1982-83 
as Exh.P.2, copy of Khasra Girdawri from Kharif 1984 to Rabi 1986 as 
Exh.P.3, copy of Khasra Girdawri from Kharif 1987 to Rabi 1991as 
Exh.P.4 (under objection), copy of Khasra Girdawri Kharif 1991 to 
Kharif 1992 as Exh.P.5 (under objection), copy of record of rights for 
the years 1990-91 as Exh.P.6 (under objection), whereas, the defendant 
No.1 examined herself as D.W.1 and produced Mubarik Ali as D.W.2 
and in documentary evidence relied upon Exh.P.1 (copy of mutation 
No.270) and Exh.P.2. (Copy of record of rights for the years 1982-
83).  
7. 
Learned trial Court decided both the issues in favour of the 
plaintiff and the said findings were maintained by the learned 
Appellate Court. It is evident from the record that both the parties did 
not produce any documentary evidence with regard to the controversy 
that whether defendants are daughters of Muhammad Yousaf or Kallu, 
therefore, both the learned Courts below decided said issues on the 
basis of oral evidence produced by the parties and declared that 
defendants are not daughters of Yousaf rather they are daughters of 
Kallu.  
8. 
There is no evidence on record to suggest that Yousaf in his 
lifetime did not acknowledge the defendants as his daughters. It is 

C.R.No.479-D of 2001. 
5
settled law that where parentage of a child cannot be easily 
ascertained, 
it 
is 
generally 
presumed 
either 
from 
express 
acknowledgment by the father or from a course of treatment given by 
the father in his lifetime. Question of legitimacy/paternity must be 
denied by the father within the stipulated period as held by august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in case titled “GHAZALA TEHSIN 
ZOHRA V. MEHR GHULAM DASTAGIR KHAN AND ANOTHER 
(PLD 2015 SUPREME COURT 323)”, wherein it was held as under: 
“It is a matter of concern that on such a vital issue we have not 
received much assistance at the bar as to how Article 128 ibid is to 
be interpreted. Redundancy is not lightly to be imputed to the 
legislature. For the purpose of harmonious construction of the said 
statutory provision, we may have resort to section 2 of the West 
Pakistan Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1962 
(Act V of 1962) which stipulates that "notwithstanding any custom 
or usage, in all questions regarding ... legitimacy or bastardy ... 
the rule of decision, subject to the provisions of any enactment for 
the time being in force shall be the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) 
in cases where the parties are Muslims". Since both parties before 
us are Muslims and section 2 aforesaid specifically refers to 
legitimacy or bastardy, resort must be made to the Muslim 
Personal Law (Shariat) for the purpose of reconciling what may 
appear to be conflicting provisions of Article 128 of the QSO. For 
this purpose, it is necessary to ascertain the rules of Muslim 
Personal Law when a person denies that he is the 
natural/biological father of children born within the period 
stipulated in Article 128 ibid. The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) 
is clear and well settled on the subject. Firstly, it provides that 
legitimacy/paternity must be denied by the father immediately after 
birth of the child as per Imam Abu Hanifa and within the post 
natal period (maximum of 40 days) after birth of the child as per 
Imam Muhammad and Imam Yousaf. There can be no lawful 
denial of paternity after this stipulated period. The Hedaya, 
Fatawa-e-Alamgiri and other texts are all agreed on this principle 
of Shariat.”  
Further held that:  
The rationale of the law set out in Article 128 of the QSO read with 
section 2 of Act V of 1962 is quite clear. Both statutes ensure (in 
specified circumstances) an unquestioned and unchallengeable 
legitimacy on the child born within the aforementioned period 
notwithstanding the existence or possibility of a fact through 
scientific evidence. The framers of the law or jurists in the Islamic 
tradition were not unaware simpletons lacking in knowledge. The 
conclusiveness of proof in respect of legitimacy of a child was 
properly thought out and quite deliberate. There is a much greater 
societal objective which is served by adhering to the said rules of 
evidence than any purpose confined to the interests of litigating 
individuals. There are many legal provisions in the statute book 

C.R.No.479-D of 2001. 
6
and rules of equity or public policy in our jurisprudence where the 
interests of individuals are subordinated to the larger public 
interest. In our opinion the law does not give a free license to 
individuals and particularly unscrupulous fathers, to make 
unlawful assertions and thus to cause harm to children as well as 
their mothers. 
9. 
But in the instant case Yousaf did not question the paternity of 
defendants during his lifetime rather treated them as his daughters. 
Evidence about existence of relationship is relevant only if the person 
has special means of knowledge on the subject. Witness testifying 
about relationship must led down the foundation of existence of his 
direct knowledge about the relationship such as being the family 
member or otherwise having special means of knowledge of 
relationship. Although PW-1 & PW-2 deposed that defendants are 
daughters of Kallu from the marriage with Mst. Maryan Bibi but said 
witnesses are neither family members nor they have special means of 
knowledge of relationship. Mere their oral assertions that Yousaf and 
Kallu both resided in their Dera without any corroborative evidence, 
cannot qualify them special means of knowledge of relationship. The 
plaintiff while recording his statement deposed that he acquired 
knowledge from his parents that defendants are not daughters of 
Yousaf, rather they are daughters of Kallu. It means that his 
deposition is also based upon hearsay evidence which has no value in 
the eye of law. 
10. 
The Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, in case titled 
“ABDUL HAQ AND ANOTHER V. MST. SURRYA BEGUM AND 
OTHERS (2002 SCMR 1330) even did not accept the evidence of the 
mother, where found her an interested witness. The facts of the case 
are that one Samad Khan who was allotted evacuee land in lieu of his 
verified claim, died in the year 1960 leaving behind a son namely Atta 
Muhammad and children of Ali Muhammad, his pre-deceased son. 
His inheritance mutation was sanctioned on the basis of will in favour 
of children of his pre-deceased son. Although, Atta Muhammad 
appeared before the Revenue Officer at the time of sanctioning of 

C.R.No.479-D of 2001. 
7
mutation and objected to give effect to the will but the Revenue 
Officer while rejecting his objections sanctioned the mutation in 
favour of sons and daughters of Ali Muhammad. Said mutation was 
challenged by sons of Ali Muhammad (petitioners before the Supreme 
Court) by instituting a suit for declaration against their sisters 
(respondents before the Supreme Court) with the allegation that they are 
daughters of Muhammad Bibi from her previous husband namely 
Nazir Muhammad and are not daughters of Ali Muhammad, therefore, 
they are not entitled and petitioners (plaintiffs) are only entitled to 
inherit whole property of Samad Khan. The suit was dismissed, 
however, appellate Court reversed the findings and decreed the suit 
but this Court while accepting the Revision Petition, set-aside the 
decree of appellate Court and restored the decree of learned appellate 
Court. Learned counsel for the petitioners in that case submitted that 
Muhammad Bibi mother of the parties, appeared as witness and stated 
that the respondents were her daughters but they were born from her 
previous wedlock with Nazir Muhammad, therefore, on the basis of 
this direct evidence of a person who had special means of knowledge 
about the relationship of respondent with Ali Muhammad, it could not 
be held that the respondents were the daughters of Ali Muhammad. 
The august Supreme Court in the said case repelled the contention of 
the learned counsel for the petitioners by observing as under: 
“The argument in our considered view in the peculiar facts and 
circumstances of this case had no force. Muhammad Bibi was 
certainly interested in support the petitioners who were her sons in 
order to retain the property in the family so that respondents-
daughters may not have any share in it so that their husbands may 
not get it.”  
Further observed that: 
“It may be added here that no evidence was led by the petitioners 
about inheritance of Nazir Muhammad, the previous husband of 
Muhammad Bibi/the alleged father of the respondents in order to 
show that after his death, mutation of his property by way of 
inheritance was sanctioned in favour of Muhammad Bibi or the 
respondents as his widow and daughters, respectively which direct 
evidence having been withheld, therefore, mere statement of 
Muhammad Bibi to support her sons was not sufficient evidence to 

C.R.No.479-D of 2001. 
8
deprive the respondents of their status as daughters of Muhammad 
Ali.”  
11. 
In the present case, question of paternity of the defendants is 
involved, therefore, it should be decided with care and caution. The 
plaintiff should have proved his case through solid, concrete and 
unimpeachable evidence, beyond any shadow of doubt. The plaintiff 
produced PW-1 & PW-2 in support of his version. PW-1 namely 
Muhammad Siddique deposed that father of Abdul Aziz was Yousaf; 
that he did not remember the name of father of Yousaf; that Yousaf 
resided in their Dera alongwith them; that name of wife of Yousaf 
was Maryan; that Maryan was already married with Kallu; that Kallu 
also resided in their Dera; that Zainab is daughter of Kallu and her 
sister Aimana is also daughter of Kallu; that Kallu died in India. 
During cross examination he maintained that at present he was not 
having his Identity Card. He also admitted that he is not Sardar or 
elder of the Baradri. He claimed his age 70/75 years, but his age 
cannot be verified as he did not possess Identity Card. He did not 
know the name of grandfather of Abdul Aziz. He did not know the 
name of the husband of Aimana (defendant No.2). He did not know 
where Aimana was married. He also admitted that now he has been 
living separately for the last 40 years. It is not believable that a person 
who is living separately for the last forty years, came forward to 
depose that defendants are not daughters of Yousaf, rather they are 
daughters of Kalu. He did not know if there are any siblings apart 
from Kalu. P.W.1 was resident of Chak No.372/W.B, Lodhran, 
whereas, Yousaf was resident of Chak No.159/W.B., Vehari, where 
the suit property was situated. From the said testimony it appears that 
he did not know much about the family affairs of the parties. PW-2 
namely Abdullah also deposed in the same lines. He admitted that 
after creation of Pakistan, he settled in Lodhran, whereas, Yousaf 
settled in Vehari. He was also not familiar with the family affairs of 
the parties. Whereas, the statement of the plaintiff as P.W.3 was based 

C.R.No.479-D of 2001. 
9
upon hearsay evidence, as he claimed that he acquired knowledge 
from his parents.  
12. 
The learned Courts below failed to consider that no one came 
from Chak No.159/W.B. District Vehari or Chak No.155/W.B, Vehari  
to support the stance of the plaintiff. Plaintiff during cross-
examination deposed that after creation of Pakistan Yousaf came to 
Chak No.155/W.B and remained alive for 15/20 years. He also 
admitted it correct that so many people of Oad Brotheri live in the 
Chak No.155/W.B. Plaintiff also admitted that they three siblings live 
together in the Chak No.155/W.B. and they arranged the marriage of 
defendants No.1 & 2.  
13. 
In order to reach a just conclusion, it is better to see the 
contents of the impugned mutation No.270 dated 22.05.1986    
(Exh.P-1). The order of sanction of the mutation is reproduced as 
under in verbatim:

" 
The said mutation was sanctioned in presence of the concerned 
Lumbardar and Chowkidar. Presence of the respondent No.1 namely 
Abdul Aziz was also shown. The Lumbardar and Chowkidar verified 
the pedigree-table prepared on the mutation, however, respondent 
No.1 raised objection upon the pedigree-table by stating that the girls 

C.R.No.479-D of 2001. 
10 
shown as daughters of Yousaf are not off-spring of Yousaf with 
Maryan. On his objection he was asked to say said fact on oath of 
Holy Quran but he failed to do so. Therefore, the revenue officer did 
not accept his version and sanctioned the mutation in the light of 
pedigree-table. Plaintiff while recording his statement as P.W.3, 
during cross-examination admitted that Ghulam Muhammad has been 
the Lumbardar of their village for a long time.  
14. 
Admittedly there is a dispute between the plaintiff and 
defendant No.1. The son of defendant No.1 was married with the 
daughter of plaintiff who later on divorced her. It seems that it was the 
reason the plaintiff raised question about the paternity of defendants to 
deprive them from the inheritance of their father.  
15. 
The learned Courts below are much impressed with the 
consenting written statement of Mst. Aimana Bibi and concluded that 
as one of the defendants admitted that she is daughter of Kallu, 
therefore, the stance of the plaintiff is proved. From the perusal of the 
written statement it appears that defendant No.2 never pleaded in her 
written statement that they are not daughters of Yousaf rather 
daughters of Kalu. She only maintained that contents of the plaint are 
correct. This written statement was filed in a casual manner and 
defendant No.2 did not express her categorical stance. The learned 
Courts below failed to consider that pleadings would not constitute 
evidence of their contents. The facts pleaded, unless admitted by the 
other party have to be proved. It is matter of record that defendant 
No.2 namely Mst. Aimana Bibi, who is stated to have filed the said 
written statement had not appeared in the witness box to support the 
contents thereof. Without cross-examination of the said lady, the 
written statement could not have been read in the evidence and even 
the written statement could be referred to as a piece of evidence it 
cannot be relied upon as an evidence of the facts stated in it. The 
Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “ABDUL MAJID v. 

C.R.No.479-D of 2001. 
11 
Syed MUHAMMAD ALI SHAMIM and 10 others” (2000 SCMR 
1391) observed as under:- 
“It is trite law that pleadings are not evidence by themselves and 
that statements of a defendant in written statement could not be 
used as evidence when amounting to admission of plaintiff’s 
plea, without the examination of the concerned party in its 
support. See. Khairul Nisa v. Muhammad Ishaque and 2 others 
(PLD 1972 SC 25) and Muhammad Ishaq v. Erose Theatre and 
others (PLD 1997 SC 109)” 
 
In case titled “Muhammad Akram and another v. Mst. Farida 
Bibi and others” (2007 SCMR 1719) it was held that: 
“It is a settled law that pleadings of the parties are not 
substantive piece of evidence unless and until the averments 
made in the pleadings proved from the evidence in Court or 
admitted by the other party. See Faqir Muhammad’s case PLD 
2003 SC 594”. 
 
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in another case titled 
“Mrs. Anis Haider and others vs. S.Amir Haider and others” (2008 
SCMR 236) held that: 
“The pleadings of parties could never be taken as an evidence 
particularly when the arbitrator was not even examined in Court 
in support of his written statement much less his cross 
examination by the party desiring so to do.” 
 
16. 
Defendant No.1 in his written statement took a specific stance 
that due to marriage of the sister of Muhammad Shafi (husband of 
defendant No.2) with plaintiff, defendant No.2 is collusive with 
plaintiff. Defendant No.1 while recording her statement as D.W.1 also 
maintained that Aimana Bibi (defendant No.2) is collusive with 
plaintiff as her marriage was performed in exchange of Abdul Aziz 
plaintiff. She further clarified that Aimana (defendant No.2) married 
with Muhammad Shafi and Muhammad Shafi‟s sister was married 
with Abdul Aziz plaintiff. Plaintiff while recording his statement as 

C.R.No.479-D of 2001. 
12 
P.W.3 also admitted this factum. This is the reason why defendant 
No.1 filed conceding written statement.  
17. 
Even otherwise, negative declaration cannot be given. A Court 
can make a declaration in a suit in favour of a person who is entitled 
to any legal character or to any right, as to any property, which 
another is denying. Plaintiff claimed that he is sole legal heir of 
Yousaf and the defendants are not daughters of Yousaf, hence, not his 
heirs, rather they were born from the earlier wedlock of Marian with 
Kallu, therefore, they are not entitled to get inheritance from the 
legacy of Yousaf. Plaintiff seeks a negative declaration and one which 
has nothing to do with plaintiff‟s own legal character. To consider 
whether such declaration can be sought under Section 42 of the 
Specific Relief Act, 1877, it would be appropriate to see the 
judgments rendered by this Court as well as august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan.  
 
In the case of “DAW PONE V. MA HNIN (AIR1941 
RANGOON 220-221), whereby a declaration was sought that 
defendant was not the keittima daughter (a particular kind of adopting) 
of her and her late husband. The Court observed that to challenge 
another‟s adoption or legitimacy of birth does not assert the plaintiff‟s 
own legal character and held as under:  
 
“Looking at S. 42, Specific Relief Act, it applies only in cases in 
which a person entitled to some legal character or to any right 
as to any property brings a suit against a person denying or 
interested to deny his title to such character or right, and the 
relief to be given there-under is purely discretionary. Nobody 
has never denied that Daw Pone is entitled to any legal 
character or right as to property that I can see. But she is 
bringing a suit for a declaration to establish a negative case, 
for, some time or other, I suppose, the defendant has claimed to 
be her keittima daughter. The learned District Judge dismissed 
that suit, apparently upon the merits and taking the view that the 
defendant was the keittima daughter of the plaintiff.” 
 
However, a person can bring a suit to assert that he/she is 
someone's child if his/her legal character is denied. In Daw Pone‟s 
case the Court had preserved the adoptee's right to claim such legal 

C.R.No.479-D of 2001. 
13 
character: 
 
“If at any time she desires to make a claim that she is the 
keittima daughter of Daw Pone, that is a matter for her and her 
legal advisers, and we desire to say nothing which may be put 
forward in defence of it. Ma Hnin May has been brought here to 
appear in answer to this appeal and we think she ought to have 
her costs, two gold mohurs, for her appearance; and the appeal 
is dismissed.” 
 
A Full Bench of this Court while identifying the type of 
declaration which could be sought with regard to one‟s legal 
character and those which could not be in a case titled “ABDUR 
RAHMAN MOBASHIR AND 3 OTHERS V. SYED AMIR ALI SHAH 
BOKHARI AND 4 OTHERS (PLD 1978 LAHORE 113)”, held as 
under: 
 
“Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act applies only to a  case 
where person files a suit claiming entitlement to any legal 
character or to any right to property which entitlement is denied 
by the defendants or in denying which the defendants are 
interested. It cannot apply to a case where the plaintiffs do not 
allege their entitlement to any legal character or any right to 
property or its denial by the defendants. As a necessary 
corollary it cannot apply to a case where only the entitlement to 
legal character or the property of the defendant is denied by the 
plaintiffs.” 
 
It was further held as under: 
“It is clear from these authorities that section 42 would be attracted to a 
case in which the plaintiff approaches the Court for the safeguard of his 
right to legal character or property but where right to his own legal 
character or property is not involved, the suit is not maintainable. The suit 
must be one which must bring benefit to him in regard to these two rights. 
No suit involving any other right, hypothetical or abstract would be 
competent under that section. The Court will not therefore entertain suits 
in which no benefit accrues to the plaintiff or where the plaintiff sets up 
merely an abstract right to satisfy his ego or satisfy his grudge against 
another person. Section 42 cannot be invoked in matters of mere 
sentiments which have no concern with the vendication of the plaintiffs' 
title to status and property.” 
 
It was also held in the said case that: 
“Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act deals with legal right as well as 
the threat or invasion to it by a person having corresponding duty not 
to invade it but to respect it. It would, therefore, apply only to a case 
where a plaintiff sues for declaration of his own legal right whether to 
property or legal character provided it invaded or threatened with 
invasion by the defendant. It does not deal with the negation of the 
defendant's rights. Consequently, a declaration that the defendant has

no right to do something which does not infringe upon any legal right 
to property or legal character of a plaintiff cannot be given under 
section 42. The cause of action under this section should, therefore, be 
a threat of Injury to the plaintiff's own right or removal of cloud cast 
on his own title. It does not allow the plaintiff to come to the Court to 
show his hostility only to what the defendant considers his own right 
and which action does not cast any cloud upon the plaintiff's own 
title.”

The Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, while discussing 
above referred case laws in a case titled as “MST. LAILA QAYYUM V. 
FAWAD QAYYUM AND OTHERS (PLD 2019 SUPREME COURT 
449), wherein Fawad (respondent/plaintiff) alleged that Laila 
(petitioner/defendant) is not Abdul Qayyum‟s daughter and therefore 
not his heir and not entitled to inherit the properties left behind by 
him, observed that Fawad seeks a negative declaration and one which 
has nothing to do with Fawad‟s own legal character and dismissed his 
suit while observed as under: 
“Fawad sought to deprive Laila of her identity and of her 
inheritance. The Court cannot legally make the declarations the 
plaintiff seeks nor can it order the cancellation of the documents. 
The suit filed by Fawad cannot be decreed. To keep such a suit 
pending only harasses the petitioner further and may deprive her 
of her inheritance. Already a lot of court time has been taken up to 
attend to this frivolous suit. Therefore, we invoke our ancillary 
powers, granted to us under Article 187 of the Constitution, as it is 
necessary for doing complete justice, and exercising such powers 
dismiss the suit pending before the Senior Civil Judge Gulkada, 
Swat. We also award costs throughout, to be paid by the 
respondent No. 1 to the petitioner. Copy of this judgment be sent to 
the Trial Court. Copy be also sent to the Registrar, Peshawar High 
Court, for placing it before the learned Judge who had passed the 
impugned Judgment.”

Both the learned Courts below on the basis of mere oral 
assertion declared that defendants are not daughters of Yousaf, rather 
they are daughters of Kallu. In the light of above discussed facts and 
circumstances it is clearly established on the record that the learned 
Courts below mis-read and non-read the evidence produced by the 
parties while passing the impugned judgments and decrees. Learned 
Courts below have acted arbitrarily and passed the impugned 
judgments and decrees in a slipshod manner, which are not 
sustainable in the eye of law.

Although, the scope of revisional jurisdiction of this court is 
limited and the concurrent findings of facts of the Courts below could 
not be reversed. But where the concurrent findings are not in 
accordance with law, there is glaring illegality, non-reading or 
misreading of evidence, then this court can interfere in the concurrent 
findings of the courts. If the concurrent findings are perverse, arbitrary 
or fanciful the same cannot be termed as „sacrosanct’ and can be 
interfered with. Reliance is made to the case of “SAMAR GUL V. 
MOHABAT KHAN” (2000 SCMR 974) and “NAZIM-UD-DIN and 
others versus Sheikh ZIA-UL-QAMAR and others” (2016 SCMR 24). 
21. 
The crux of the above discussion is that the revision petition in 
hand succeeds and the same is allowed. Consequently, impugned 
judgments & decrees of the Courts below are set-aside and suit 
instituted by the respondent No.1 is dismissed with cost throughout.
