ABID HUSSAIN CHATTHA, J: This Appeal is preferred under Section 
12 of the Punjab Waqf Properties Ordinance, 1979 (the “Ordinance”) 
against the Judgment dated 31.03.2022 passed by District Judge, Khanewal, 
whereby, Petition of the Appellants under Section 11 of the Ordinance was 
dismissed. 
2. 
 
The Appellants averred in their Petition that Appellant No. 1 is 
Sajjada Nasheen and Appellant No. 2 is Majawar / hereditary tenant of the 
Shrine of Hazrat Shah Habib Ullah Baghdadi (the “Shrine”) situated at 
Mauza Baghdad, Tehsil Mianchannu, District Khanewal. Impugning 
notification No. SOP-1(123)A/2014 dated 24.02.2016 (the “Notification”) 

2 
 
 
 
 
 
FAO No. 63 / 2022 
 
 
 
issued under Section 7 of the Ordinance by Respondent No. 1 and acted 
upon by Respondent No. 2 (the “Auqaf Department”), it is alleged that 
Respondent No. 3 unlawfully claiming himself as the Sajjada Nasheen of 
the Shrine initially instituted a civil suit against the Appellants and others 
praying that he along with others be declared as legal heirs of the Shrine and 
later, submitted an application for appointment of Receiver of the Shrine. 
The said application was accepted by the Civil Court vide order dated 
29.06.2011 but the said decision was reversed by the Appellate Court on 
27.07.2011. Further challenge thereto by Respondent No. 3 failed when C.R. 
No. 828 / 2011 was dismissed vide order dated 05.08.2015. By the same 
order, C. R. Nos. 1175 and 1368 of 2014 were disposed of as having become 
infructuous, whereas, W.P. No. 14770 / 2014 instituted by the Appellants 
was disposed of with a direction not to cause harassment to the Appellants. 
Finally, Respondent No. 3 filed C. P. No. 2833 / 2015 against the aforesaid 
order dated 05.08.2015 which is pending before the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan. Nevertheless, by concealing the aforesaid material facts regarding 
pending litigation between the parties as well as possession of the Appellants 
over the Shrine, Respondent No. 3 filed an application before the Auqaf 
Department for taking over possession of the Shrine. Acting upon the said 
application, impugned Notification was issued and in consequence thereof, 
the Auqaf Department assumed administration, control, management and 
maintenance of the Shrine including the adjacent personal properties and 
residences of the Appellants as described in the Schedule to the impugned 
Notification i.e. 
“1. 
An area measuring 25 Kanals, 02 Marlas, containing the 
said Shrine, Jamia Masjid, Graveyard, Mela ground, 
Musafir Khana and Mehl Sadat bearing Khewat No. 1131 
min, Khatooni No. 508, according to the register 
Haqdaran-e-zameen for the year 2010-2011 of mauza 
Baghdad, Tehsil Mian Channu, District Khanewal. 
2. 
An area measuring 30 Kanals, 12 Marlas agricultural 
land bearing khewat No. 1131 min, Khatooni No. 507, 
according to the register Haqdaran-e-zameen for  the year 

3 
 
 
 
 
 
FAO No. 63 / 2022 
 
 
 
2010-11 of mauza Baghdad, Tehsil Mian Channu, 
District Khanewal. 
3. 
Offerings & subscriptions made to said Waqf.” 
3. 
 
Hence, the impugned Notification is unlawful for the reasons 
that Appellants No. 1 & 2 as Sajjada Nasheen and Mazara Moroosi of the 
Shrine, respectively are owners-in-possession on the basis of mutations 
attested in their favour but notwithstanding the same, the entire land 
measuring 55 Kanals and 14 Marlas (the “suit property”) including the 
Shrine was declared Waqf property and taken over without issuing prior 
notice and providing an opportunity of hearing to the Appellants.  
4. 
 
The Auqaf Department and Respondent No. 3 filed separate but 
similar written statements raising a number of preliminary objections. On 
merits, it was claimed that an area of 25 Kanals and 02 Marlas of the suit 
property is shown in possession of Ahl-e-Islam in the Revenue record, 
whereas, an area of 30 Kanals and 12 Marlas of the suit property is declared 
as Waqf property in terms of the impugned Notification. The Appellants 
were not served before issuance of the impugned Notification for the reason 
that a survey was conducted in which Appellant No. 1 affixed his signatures 
and as such, the impugned Notification was in knowledge of the Appellants. 
The status of the Appellants as Sajjada Nasheen and Mazara Moroosi was 
denied with the counter stance that Respondent No. 3 is the Sajjada Nasheen 
of the Shrine on the premises that the Appellants and their predecessor-in-
interests had filed civil suits regarding the Shrine in the years 1992, 1995 
and 2015 which had been dismissed. The referred litigation by the 
Appellants was termed as irrelevant to the present proceedings since after 
issuance of the impugned Notification, Respondent No. 3 has withdrawn his 
civil suit and an appeal qua appointment of Receiver from the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan. Accordingly, it was asserted that the impugned 
Notification has been issued in accordance with law after fulfillment of all 
legal formalities.

FAO No. 63 / 2022 
 
 
 
5. 
 
It is pertinent to mention that initially Appellant No. 1 filed     
W. P. No. 12828 / 2016 challenging validity of the impugned Notification 
which was dismissed vide order dated 07.09.2016 on the ground that the 
Appellants can avail statutory remedy before the District Judge under 
Section 11 of the Ordinance. Meanwhile, the Appellants had instituted the 
titled Petition on 06.04.2016. However, the Petition was dismissed for non-
prosecution on 29.04.2016 but vide order dated 19.04.2018 passed by this 
Court in FAO No. 80 / 2017, the same was restored. Later, the Petition was 
dismissed on the ground of limitation vide order dated 08.10.2018 but FAO 
No. 96 / 2018 preferred in this behalf was allowed vide order dated 
07.12.2021 by this Court with a direction to the Trial Court to decide the 
same on merits in accordance with law. Thereafter, vide order dated 
09.02.2022, the Trial Court converted nomenclature of the Petition which 
was in the nature of Appeal into a Petition under Section 11 of the 
Ordinance.  
6. 
 
The Trial Court vide order dated 09.02.2022 dismissed an 
application under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908           
(the “CPC”) filed by the Appellants seeking restoration of possession over 
the suit property included in the impugned Notification and framed the 
following issues:- 
(i) 
Whether 
the 
impugned 
Notification 
issued 
by 
Respondent No. 1 under Section 7 of the Ordinance is 
illegal, void, against law and facts and the same is liable 
to be set aside on the grounds mentioned in the Petition? 
OPA; 
(ii) 
Whether the Petitioners have no cause of action to file 
this Petition? OPR; and 
(iii) 
Whether the instant Petition is false and frivolous and the 
same is liable to be dismissed and Respondents are 
entitled to get special costs under Section 35-A of the 
CPC? OPR 
7. 
 
After recording evidence of the parties, the Trial Court 
proceeded to dismiss the Petition vide impugned Judgment dated 31.03.2022 

5 
 
 
 
 
 
FAO No. 63 / 2022 
 
 
 
by holding that the impugned Notification was issued in accordance with 
law based on the following reasons:- 
(i) 
Appellant No. 1 (AW-I) during cross examination 
admitted that the suit property is being used for public 
purposes from the time immemorial, thus, attracting 
Explanation 1 of Section 2(e) of the Ordinance and as 
such, the suit property is Waqf property; 
(ii) 
The Appellants have failed to prove through confidence 
inspiring evidence that suit property is a private property;  
(iii) 
The Appellants neither pleaded nor deposed that they 
were not served in accordance with law, whereas, it is on 
record that before issuance of the impugned Notification, 
a survey was conducted by the Auqaf Department and 
report in this behalf was duly signed by Appellant No. 1 
as a witness bearing his CNIC, as such, proceedings of 
the Auqaf Department conducted before issuance of the 
impugned Notification were in knowledge of the 
Appellants; 
(iv) 
It was not mandatory upon the Auqaf Department to 
personally hear the Appellants before issuing the 
impugned Notification;  
(v) 
Appellant No. 1 also failed to prove through cogent and 
confidence inspiring evidence that he is the Sajjada 
Nasheen of the Shrine; and  
(vi) 
The contention that the impugned Notification issued on 
24.02.2016 was published in the Official Gazette on 
06.04.2016 but Auqaf Department got possession of the 
Shrine on 15.03.2016 cannot be considered as the said 
objection was not taken in the Petition, no issue was 

6 
 
 
 
 
 
FAO No. 63 / 2022 
 
 
 
framed thereon and as such, no evidence could be led or 
considered in this behalf. 
8. 
 
Learned counsel for the Appellants submitted that the impugned 
Judgment is not only based on misreading and non-reading of evidence on 
record but result of misapplication of law. The Appellants proved that they 
are the Sajjada Nasheen / Mutwalli and Mazara Moroosi of the suit property 
consisting of the Shrine, Masjid, Graveyard and private land. These facts 
were also established in the previous round of litigation initiated by 
Respondent No. 3 qua appointment of Receiver. After withdrawal of C. P. 
No. 2833 / 2015 from the Supreme Court of Pakistan vide order dated 
03.05.2016 by Respondent No. 3, the Judgment dated 05.08.2015 passed by 
this Court in C. R. No. 828 / 2011 attained finality, wherein, it was 
conclusively held in paragraph No. 10 that Respondent No. 3 failed to 
produce any document to show his possession over the suit property, 
whereas, record indicates that the Appellants were in possession of the suit 
property and Respondent No. 3 has admitted that the Appellants were 
administering the Shrine as Mutwali and Mazara Moroosi under condition 
No. 8 of Wajab-ul-Arz and under the customs. 
9. 
 
Learned counsel for the Appellants vehemently contended that 
the impugned Notification under Section 7 of the Ordinance has been issued 
without lawful authority as the same was dispatched on 01.03.2016 to 11 
officials by conspicuously omitting the Appellants which irrefutably proves 
that the Appellants being in possession of suit property were not served in 
gross violation of mandatory requirement of Section 7 of the Ordinance. 
Further, the impugned Notification was published in the official Gazette on 
06.04.2016 while possession of suit property was forcibly taken over on 
15.03.2016 in complete disregard of the provisions of Section 7 of the 
Ordinance. He placed reliance on cases titled, “Chief Administrator Auqaf v. 
Allah Bakhsh (decd) through LRs and another” (2011 SCMR 235); 
“Muhammad Ishaq v. Chief Administrator of Auqaf, Punjab” (PLD 1977 
Supreme Court 639); and “Chief Administrator Auqaf and others v. Diwan 

7 
 
 
 
 
 
FAO No. 63 / 2022 
 
 
 
Sheikh Taj-ud-Din and others” (PLD 2012 Supreme Court 897). He 
emphasized that the Trial Court fell in error while holding that the 
Appellants did not mention in their Petition or in their examination-in-chief 
that the impugned Notification was not served upon them which is 
misreading and non-reading of record since the said fact was specifically 
asserted in the Petition and deposed in the examination-in-chief of the 
Appellants. There is nothing on record except the survey report signed by 
the Appellants qua their knowledge which cannot be regarded as substitute 
to a right of hearing or service of the impugned Notification under Section 7 
of the Ordinance, particularly, when the survey report was conducted with 
reference to proceedings qua appointment of Receiver and the same could 
not be made basis for taking over the administration, control, management 
and maintenance of the suit property under Section 7 of the Ordinance 
without complying with the requirements and conditions laid therein. The 
fact of assailing vires of the impugned Notification is also evident from 
order dated 09.02.2022 passed by the Trial Court on the application of the 
Appellants under Section 151 of the CPC for restoration of possession over 
the suit property in which not only the said legal objections were specifically 
raised but after submission of contesting reply by the Respondents, the same 
was adjudicated upon by the Trial Court. Similarly, observation of the Trial 
Court based upon the alleged statement of AW-1 to the effect that the suit 
property was a Waqf property is misconceived since AW-1 had categorically 
deposed that private land is used once in a year temporarily on the occasion 
of Urs. As such, findings of the Trial Court are in contrast to record and the 
applicable law that the Waqf property must be used continuously and 
permanently for religious purposes. Reliance was placed on cases titled, 
“The Chief Administrator of Auqaf, Punjab v. Mst. Raj Bibi and others” 
(2000 SCMR 961); “Mubarik Ali Shah and 4 others v. Chief Administrative 
Auqaf” (1988 CLC 348); and “Khursheed Ahmad and 3 others v. Province 
of Punjab through Collector and 9 others” (PLD 2023 Lahore 245).  
10. 
 
Learned counsels for the Auqaf Department and Respondent 
No. 3 defended the impugned Judgment on all fours stating the same is in 

8 
 
 
 
 
 
FAO No. 63 / 2022 
 
 
 
consonance with law addressing all the objections raised in this Appeal. It 
was vociferously contended that service of the impugned Notification under 
Section 7 of the Ordinance was dispensed with for the reason that the 
Appellants were associated with the survey report conducted by the Auqaf 
Department which fact is not denied by the Appellants. The suit property has 
rightly been declared as Waqf property and the same has been lawfully taken 
over by the Auqaf Department in exercise of powers conferred under the 
Ordinance. 
11. 
 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
12. 
 
At the very outset, it is expedient to identify the applicable 
provisions of law under which the Auqaf Department issued the impugned 
Notification before applying it to the established facts of the case. Waqf 
property is defined in Section 2(e) of the Ordinance which reads as under:- 
“Waqf Property" means property of any kind permanently 
dedicated by a person professing Islam for any purpose 
recognized by Islam as religious, pious or charitable, but does 
not includes property of any such waqf as is described in 
section 3 of the Mussalman Waqf Validating Act, 1913 (VI of 
1913), under which any benefit is for the time being claimable 
for himself by the person by whom the waqf was created or by 
any member of his family or descendants. 
Explanation 1– If a property has been used from time 
immemorial for any purpose recognized by Islam as religious, 
pious or charitable, then inspite of there being no evidence of 
express dedication, such property shall be deemed to be waqf 
property.  
Explanation 2– Property allotted in lieu or in exchange of waqf 
property left in India shall be deemed to be waqf property. 
Explanation 3– Property of any kind acquired with the sale 
proceeds or in exchange of or from the income arising out of 
waqf property or from subscriptions raised for any purpose 
recognized by Islam as religious, pious or charitable shall be 
deemed to be waqf property. 
Explanation 4– The income from boxes placed at a shrine and 
offerings, subscriptions or articles of any kind, description or 
use presented to a shrine or to any person at the premises of a 
shrine, shall be deemed to be waqf property. 
Explanation 5– Property permanently dedicated for the 
purposes of a mosque, takia, khankah, dargarh or other shrine 
shall be deemed to be waqf property. 

9 
 
 
 
 
 
FAO No. 63 / 2022 
 
 
 
Explanation 6– Relief of the poor and the orphan, education, 
worship, medical relief, maintenance of shrines or the 
advancement of any other object of charitable, religious or 
pious nature or of general public utility shall be deemed to be 
charitable purposes.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
13. 
 
Section 7 of the Ordinance which allowed the Auqaf 
Department to take over Waqf property as existing at the relevant time reads 
as follows:- 
“7.   Chief Administrator may take over waqf property by 
notification.– (1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
contained in section 22 of the Religious Endowments Act, 1863 
(XX of 1863), or any other law for the time being in force, or in 
any custom or usage, or in any decree, judgment or order of 
any court or other authority, or in any proceedings pending 
before any court or other authority, the Chief Administrator 
may, by notification, take over and assume the administration, 
control, management and maintenance of a waqf property: 
Provided that, during the life time of a person dedicating 
a waqf property, the Chief Administrator shall not take over 
and assume the administration, control, management and 
maintenance of such waqf property except with the consent of 
such person and on such terms and conditions as may be 
agreed upon between such person and the Chief Administrator: 
Provided that the notification shall be served upon the 
management or the mutawalli and also affixed on some 
prominent part of the property which is sought to be taken over. 
Explanation. For the purposes of this section “control 
and management” shall include control over the performance 
and management of religious, spiritual, cultural and other 
services and ceremonies (Rasoomat) at or in a waqf property. 
(2) 
No person shall perform services or ceremonies 
(Rasoomat) referred to in sub-section (1) except with the prior 
permission of the Chief Administrator and in accordance with 
such directions as may be given by him.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
14. 
 
It is manifestly evident from conjunctive bare reading of the 
above provisions of law that powers conferred upon the Chief Administrator 
of the Auqaf Department are not unbridled but regulated in the manner that it 
can only take over and assume the administration, control, management and 
maintenance of a Waqf property which necessitates a prior declaration that 

10 
 
 
 
 
 
FAO No. 63 / 2022 
 
 
 
the property is actually a Waqf property in terms of Section 2(e) of the 
Ordinance if not already registered as Waqf property under Section 6 of the 
Ordinance. The act of declaring a property as Waqf property can only be 
exercised by issuance of a notification with a mandatory caveat to effect 
prior service of such notification upon the management or the Mutawalli and 
by affixing the same on some prominent part of the property sought to be 
taken over. The rationale of the mechanism prescribed by law is to afford a 
right of hearing to all concerned who may have an adverse interest to the 
proposed action. The process entails determination of objections and 
interests of all concerned to ensure that legitimate and lawful rights of any 
person are not compromised. Once such an exercise is complete, only then 
the issued notification is ripe for publication followed by its implementation. 
This is the minimum threshold for scrutiny regarding the powers exercised 
by the Chief Administrator of the Auqaf Department pursuant to Section 7 of 
the Ordinance in the wake of a legal challenge in the Court of law. 
15. 
 
The case has a chequered history. It is apparent from record that 
there has been frequent litigation between different members of the family 
with respect to their claim qua Sajjada Nasheeni of the Shrine. The parties 
are at divergence in terms of their pleadings regarding claims of Sajjada 
Nasheeni of the Shrine, ownership, possession and status of the suit property 
including the Shrine and validity of the impugned Notification. Separate 
issues were not framed by the Trial Court in this respect but were adequately 
covered in the composite issue No. 1. There was no objection from any of 
the parties to the lis, as such, all the points in issue were within the 
contemplation of the parties who led evidence, accordingly. Therefore, the 
evidence tendered by the parties on the said points was not beyond 
pleadings. 
16. 
 
The Appellants have specifically asserted in the Petition that 
Appellant No. 1 is the Sajjada Nasheen and Appellant No. 2 is Mazara 
Moroosi of the Shrine. They are owners in possession of the suit property 
and the proceedings culminating into the impugned Notification were carried 
out by the Auqaf Department behind their back in collusion with Respondent 

11 
 
 
 
 
 
FAO No. 63 / 2022 
 
 
 
No. 3 without their knowledge and in denial of their statutory right of 
hearing. As such, the impugned Notification is ultra vires the law and they 
were forcibly dispossessed in complete disregard of law under the garb of 
the impugned Notification. The Appellants as AW-1 and AW-2 along with 
AW-3 consistently deposed the aforesaid facts to prove that the suit property 
is not a Waqf property and the impugned Notification was issued in gross 
violation of law. None of the AWs deposed that the suit property was being 
used for time immemorial for any purpose recognized by Islam as religious, 
pious or charitable within the contemplation of Explanation 1 to Section 2(e) 
of the Ordinance attracted by the Trial Court. Rather, they time and again 
emphasized that the suit property including the Shrine is private though the 
same was used during Urs and special occasions to accommodate Zaireen. 
AW-4, the Halqa Patwari as an independent witness while exhibiting 
revenue record (Ex.A-1 to Ex.A-5) candidly deposed in his cross 
examination that Khewat No. 131, Khatooni No. 508, Khasra No. 21 / 29 
measuring 01-Kanal is Ghair Momkin Masjid and Khasra No. 117 
measuring 24-Kanals & 02 Marlas is Ghair Mumkin Qabrustan constituting 
land measuring 25-Kanals and 02 Marlas which is Maqbooza Ahl-e-Islam, 
whereas, Khatooni No. 507 consists of cultivatable agricultural land in the 
name of different persons i.e. 30-Kanals and 12 Marlas of land and 
Appellant No. 1 is one of the co-sharer in Khewat No. 131 and owner of 
land measuring 08-Marlas & 07 Sarsai. Cultivation of Auqaf Department is 
from Kharif 2015 till today in Khasra Nos. 21 / 3, 4, 7, 8 / 1, 13 / 1 & 13 / 3. 
Revenue record (Ex.A-1 to Ex.A-5) confirms the aforesaid facts and 
establishes that 30-Kanals and 12 Marlas of land in the suit property was 
private land having several owners including Appellant No. 1 and has been 
in possession of private persons including Appellant No. 2 before it was 
taken over by the Auqaf Department. There is no evidence on record that the 
suit property was ever permanently dedicated as Waqf property. 
17. 
 
Respondent No. 3 appeared as RW-1 and claimed Sajjada 
Nasheeni of the Shrine on the basis of alleged previous suits but could not 
prove his claim. He stated that the Appellants used to vex and harass him 

12 
 
 
 
 
 
FAO No. 63 / 2022 
 
 
 
due to which he filed an application before the Auqaf Department to take 
over charge of the Shrine upon which the Auqaf Department started legal 
proceedings. In his cross examination, he stated that he is an Advocate of 
this Court and never challenged entries of revenue record regarding 
possession of the Appellants, however, volunteered that Appellant No. 1 was 
not in possession of the suit property and denied the suggestion that his 
volunteered statement is false. RW-2, ex-District Manager Auqaf, Khanewal 
in his cross examination admitted that according to the report of revenue 
record, the word ‘Waqf’ is not written with respect to the suit property. He 
also admitted that signature of Appellant No. 1 is not available on record as 
he refused to put his signatures. He stated that he did not know who was in 
possession of the suit property prior to 15.03.2016 when the same was taken 
over by the Auqaf Department, the impugned Notification was published in 
the official Gazette on 06.04.2016 and that the Appellants were not 
associated with the proceedings prior to its issuance. 
18. 
 
Undoubtedly, the present lis leading into issuance of the 
impugned Notification was triggered on the application of Respondent No. 3 
to the Auqaf Department in which he had not specifically claimed possession 
of the Shrine or the suit property but urged the Auqaf Department to take 
over possession of the suit property including the Shrine claiming therein 
that it is Waqf property in order to avoid conflict and for its better 
management. Even in his written reply, Respondent No. 3 although claimed 
that he is Sajjada Nasheen of the Shrine but did not specifically claim 
ownership and possession of the Shrine or the suit property. Further, the 
Auqaf Department did not specifically controvert that the impugned 
Notification was not served upon the Appellants, rather, stated that it was 
dispensed with as Appellant No. 1 being signatory to the survey report dated 
15.10.2014 (Mark-B) was aware of such proceedings.  
19. 
 
It is vividly evident from record that Respondent No. 3 initially 
instituted a suit for declaration against the Appellants to the effect that he 
along with others be declared as legal heirs of the Shrine and during 
pendency of the suit procured order dated 29.06.2011 qua appointment of 

13 
 
 
 
 
 
FAO No. 63 / 2022 
 
 
 
Receiver from the Trial Court. The said order was set aside by the Appellate 
Court vide order dated 27.07.2011 in which it was held that as per copy of 
record of rights 2006-2007, Appellant No. 1 along with others is owner of 
the suit property and Appellant No. 2 along with others is in possession of 
the suit property as tenant who are also in possession of Kasra No. 28 
regarding the Shrine and Khasra Gardawari dated 01.03.2011 qua the suit 
property also affirms their possession. As such, the Appellate Court 
confirmed the status of Appellant No. 1 and Appellant No. 2 as Sajjada 
Nasheen and Mazara Moroosi after repelling the rival claim of Respondent 
No. 3 qua Sajjada Nasheeni of the Shrine based on dismissal of prior suits 
allegedly filed by the predecessors-in-interest and / or the Appellants in this 
behalf by holding that such claim is not established on record. This Court 
while deciding C.R. No. 828 of 2011, C.R. 1175/2014, C.R. No. 1368/2014 
and W.P. No. 14770/2014 vide order dated 05.08.2015 upheld the order 
dated 27.07.2011 of the Appellate Court which attained finality after 
Respondent No. 3 withdrew C.P. No. 2833/2015 on 03.05.2016 from the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan and his civil suit seeking to declare him and 
others as legal heirs of the Shrine. As such, it is established that the 
Appellants were in possession of the suit property before passing of the 
impugned Notification as Sajjada Nasheen and Mazara Moroosi of the suit 
property including the Shrine and that the suit property was not a Waqf 
property.  
20. 
 
The survey report was conducted with reference to the aforesaid 
pending litigation qua Receiver between the parties. The perusal of survey 
report dated 15.10.2014 reveals that it is essentially regarding the income 
generated from the Shrine for two days i.e. 25th to 26th September, 2014 
which carries the signature of Appellant No. 1 dated 26.09.2014. The same 
was apparently conducted pursuant to the application of Respondent No. 3 
for appointment of Receiver and not in pursuance to his application seeking 
taking over of the administration, control, management and maintenance of 
the Shrine and the suit property by the Auqaf Department. Even otherwise,

the said survey report lacks any finding qua nature of the suit property 
including the Shrine. There is no express finding of the Auqaf Department as 
to how and on what basis the suit property or any part thereof was declared 
as Waqf property. The impugned Notification was issued on 24.02.2016 and 
dispatched on 01.03.2016 to 11 officials listed therein which conspicuously 
omitted the Appellants who were in possession of the suit property at the 
relevant time and were residing in the houses built thereon. The Auqaf 
Department took forcible possession of the suit property on 15.03.2016, 
whereas, the impugned Notification was admittedly published in the official 
Gazette on 06.04.2016. As such, the Appellants were never confronted to 
determination qua status of suit property. Hence, the survey report having 
the signature of Appellant No. 1 could not be made basis to circumvent the 
mandatory requirement of prior service of the impugned Notification upon 
the Appellants being in possession of the suit property before it was 
published in official Gazette. Consequently, the suit property measuring 55 
Kanals and 14 Marlas including the Shrine was taken over by the Auqaf 
Department through the impugned Notification without providing an 
opportunity of hearing to the Appellants and without determining their rival 
claim of ownership and possession regarding the suit property. The 
impugned Notification was also not affixed on some prominent part of the 
suit property before it was taken over thus preventing any other concerned 
person to raise objections thereon. Hence, the Appellants were effectively 
denied the right of hearing to establish their case in derogation of Article 10-
A of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 which 
guarantees the right of fair trial as well as in breach of the provisions of 
Section 7 of the Ordinance as noted above. The admission of the Auqaf 
Department that the impugned Notification was not served upon the 
Appellants vitiated its entire proceedings and as such, publication of the 
impugned Notification was illegal and without any lawful authority, thus 
ineffective qua rights and interests of the Appellants. For reference, see 
Allah Bakhsh and Diwan  Sheikh Taj-ud-Din cases (supra).

In view of the above, this Appeal is allowed; and the impugned 
Judgment dated 31.03.2022 as well as the impugned Notification are set 
aside. Nevertheless, the Auqaf Department may initiate fresh proceedings in 
accordance with law within the mandate of Section 7 of the Ordinance.
