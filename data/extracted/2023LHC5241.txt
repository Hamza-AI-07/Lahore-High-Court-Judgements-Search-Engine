Through this petition under section 426 (2B) Cr.P.C. 
petitioners seek suspension of sentences i.e., imprisonment for life 
and compensation on two counts under section 302(b) read with 
section 34, PPC and rigorous imprisonment for ten years with fine 
under section 324 read with section 34, PPC; as altered by this 
Court vide judgment dated 09.05.2018 passed in Murder Reference 
No.27 of 2013 and the appeals filed against the judgment dated 
22.01.2013 passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, 
Dunyanpur, District Lodhran in a private complaint titled “Ghulam 
Farooq vs. Muhammad Iqbal, etc.” arising out of case FIR 
No.295/2010 dated 26.07.2010 under sections 302, 324, 148/149, 
109 PPC registered at Police Station City Dunyapur, District 
Lodhran.   
2. 
The learned counsel for the petitioners submits that petition 
for leave to appeal filed against the judgment of this Court dated 
09.05.2018 passed in Murder Reference No.27/2013 and the 
connected matters, was fixed before the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
on 03.03.2023, wherein leave has been granted, therefore, pursuant 
to section 426 (2B) Cr.P.C., the sentences of the petitioners may be 
suspended and they be released on bail. On the other hand learned 
Prosecutors opposed the exercise of jurisdiction by this Court under 
above section on the ground that petitioners were not on bail during 

Crl.Misc.No.3200-M/2023 in Crl.A.No.55/2013. 2 
 
hearing of their appeals and section 426 (2B) Cr.P.C. is meant for a 
situation when High Court grants a ‘special leave to appeal’ to the 
Supreme Court and not at the time when ‘leave to appeal’ is granted 
by the Supreme Court because such Court has powers to stay the 
execution of any sentence, pending the petition or appeal, under 
Supreme Court Rules, 1980. Divergent pleas and stances of 
proponents required us to probe and see the nature of sub-Section 
(2B) of 426 Cr.P.C.  
3. 
Heard, record perused: In order to view sub-section (2B) of 
section 426 Cr.P.C in its entirety, some relevant material including 
Acts, Constitutional provisions, rules and precedents were essential 
which were collected with the help of Mr. Muhammad Jaffar, 
Additional Prosecutor General and Mr. Ijaz Hussain, Civil Judge, 
working in research center at Multan Bench. Their effort for 
providing requisite assistance is highly appreciated.   
4. 
It evinces that sub-section (2B) was inserted in section 426 
Cr.P.C. for grant of bail to an accused in a situation when High 
Court has convicted him or maintained his sentence and a special 
leave to appeal to Supreme Court is granted against said conviction. 
Considering the stance of learned prosecutors, a question arises as 
to whether remedy in the form of “special leave to appeal” is 
availed from a High Court for filing appeal to the Supreme Court or 
it is directly granted by the Supreme Court and what connotes 
‘special leave to appeal’ when it has not been defined anywhere in 
law. This is the core point of our discussion in this case, because 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and Supreme 
Court Rules, 1980 talk about ‘leave to appeal’ and not ‘special 
leave to appeal’. We were also concerned about the situation that 
when after decision, no lis remains pending with High Court and it 
becomes functus officio, then how it can grant bail to the accused 
whom leave to appeal is granted by the Supreme Court in such case. 
In order to find the true spirit of this sub-section, we went into 
recitation of relevant law, Constitutional provisions, Rules and 

Crl.Misc.No.3200-M/2023 in Crl.A.No.55/2013. 3 
 
precedents, and while doing this exercise we were also thoughtful 
as to whether any other like provision is available in prevalent law, 
we however, found a response while tracking and reading section 
382A Cr.P.C. which authorizes the trial court to suspend the 
sentence of accused and allow him to remain on bail even after 
conviction except in two situations for enabling the convict to file 
appeal against his conviction and sentence. Section is reproduced;  
 
382-A. Postponement of execution of sentences of imprisonment 
under Section 476 or for a period of less than one year: 
Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 383 or 391, where the 
accused— 
(a) is awarded any sentence of imprisonment under Section 476, or  
(b) is sentenced in cases other than those provided for in Section 381, to 
imprisonment whether with or without fine or whipping, for a period of 
less than one year.  
the sentence shall not, if the accused furnishes bail to the satisfaction of 
the Court for his appearance at such time and place as the Court may 
direct, be executed, until the expiry of the period prescribed for making 
an appeal against such sentence, or if an appeal is made within that 
time, until the sentence of imprisonment is confirmed by the Appellate 
Court, but the sentence shall be executed as soon as practicable after the 
expiry of the period prescribed for making an appeal.  
or in case of an appeal, as soon as practicable after the receipt of the 
order of the Appellate Court confirming the sentence. 
The above is an enabling provision for accused to file appeal 
against conviction while on bail, and whether sub-section (2B) of 
section 426 Cr.P.C. also maintains the like status that when High 
Court after conviction grants to the convict special leave to appeal 
to the Supreme Court, it has also power to suspend his sentence 
enabling him to file such appeal, or it is entirely a different 
provision, giving a special jurisdiction to High Court to suspend 
sentence of an accused whom Supreme Court has granted leave to 
appeal; therefore, we feel it appropriate to track the legislative 
history of this provision, and the situation prevailed before and after 
insertion of sub-section (2B) in section 426 Cr.P.C. 
5. 
Government of India Act, 1915 by virtue of section 113 
authorized His Majesty to establish High Court of Judicature in any 

Crl.Misc.No.3200-M/2023 in Crl.A.No.55/2013. 4 
 
territory in British India through letters patent; for better 
understanding Section is reproduced; 
“His Majesty may, if he sees fit, by letters patent, establish a high court 
of judicature in any territory in British India, whether or not included 
within the limits of the local jurisdiction of another high court, and 
confer on any high court so established any such jurisdiction, powers 
and authority as are vested in or may be conferred on any high court 
existing at the commencement of this Act and, where a high court is so 
established in any area included within the limits of the local 
jurisdiction of another high court, His Majesty may, by letters patent, 
alter those limits, and make such incidental, consequential and 
supplemental provisions as may appear to be necessary by reason of the 
alteration”.                                                               (emphasis supplied) 
Therefore, under said Act, through letters patent dated 21st March, 
1919, His Majesty Constituted the High Court of Judicature at 
Lahore for the Province of the Punjab and Delhi. As per clause-31 
of such letters patent, right of appeal from any judgment, order or 
sentence of High Court in criminal cases was granted which is as 
follows; 
31. 
And We do further ordain that from any judgment, order or 
sentence of the High Court of Judicature at Lahore, made in the 
exercise of original criminal jurisdiction or in any criminal case where 
any point or points of law have been reserved for the opinion of the said 
High Court, in manner provided by the 18th clause of these presents by 
any Court which has exercised original jurisdiction, order or sentence to 
appeal Us, Our heirs or successors, in Council, provided the said High 
Court declares that the case is a fit one for such appeal, and that the 
appeal be made under such conditions as the said High Court may 
establish or require, but subject always to such rules and orders as are 
now in force, or may from time to time be made, respecting appeals to 
Ourselves in Council from the Courts of the Provinces of the Punjab 
and Delhi. 
This was a special right of appeal to His Majesty in Council against 
any judgment, order or sentence of the High Court, (1) made in the 
exercise of original criminal jurisdiction or (2) in any criminal case 
and that too with special leave of High Court in a particular 
situation when the High Court reserves any point or points of law 
and declares a case fit for appeal, and not in very case as a matter of 
course.  
6. 
Later through Government of India Act, 1935, Federal Court 
was constituted and pursuant to section 205, a right of appeal to 
Federal Court was given against any judgment, decree or final order 

Crl.Misc.No.3200-M/2023 in Crl.A.No.55/2013. 5 
 
of a High Court that too in the like terms as mentioned in clause-31 
of the letters patent cited above i.e., issuance of certificate by the 
High Court that the case involves a substantial question of law as to 
the interpretation of this Act or any Order in Council made 
thereunder; Section 205 runs as under; 
205.-(1) An appeal shall lie to the Federal Court from any judgment, 
decree or final order of a High Court in British India, if the High Court 
certifies that the case involves a substantial question of law as to the 
interpretation of this Act or any Order in Council made thereunder, and 
it shall be the duty of every High Court in British India to consider in 
every case whether or not any such question is involved and of its own 
motion to give or to withhold a certificate accordingly.  
(2) Where such a certificate is given, any party in the case may appeal 
to the Federal Court on the ground that any such question as aforesaid 
has been wrongly decided, and on any ground on which that party could 
have appealed without special leave to His Majesty in Council if no 
such certificate had been given, and, with the leave of the Federal 
Court, on any other ground, and no direct appeal shall lie to His 
Majesty in Council, either with or without special leave. 
Though there was a finality to the judgment of High Court except in 
a situation when High Court grants leave to appeal to His Majesty 
in Council, but with the establishment of Federal Court, by virtue of 
above section a conditional right of appeal was provided against 
any judgment, decree or final order of High Court so as to curtail 
direct litigation to His Majesty in Council. However, it did not 
disturb the arrangement/remedy in place under clause-31 of letters 
patent, which is reflected from sub-section (2) of Section 205 
above. As per clause-31 of letters patent, appeal before His majesty 
in Council was competent in following situation; 
i. 
against any judgment, order or sentence of high court passed in exercise 
of original criminal jurisdiction; 
 
ii. 
in any criminal case where any point or points of law have been 
reserved for the opinion of the said High Court. 
 
provided the High Court declares that the case is a fit one for such 
appeal, and that the appeal be made under such conditions as the High 
Court may establish or require. 
Whereas appeal before the Federal Court u/s 205 above was 
competent against any judgment, decree or final order of a High 
Court if the High Court certifies that the case involves a substantial 
question of law as to the interpretation of this Act or any Order in Council 
made thereunder. The section indicates that it was enacted primarily 

Crl.Misc.No.3200-M/2023 in Crl.A.No.55/2013. 6 
 
for right of appeal in civil matters as reflected from the words used, 
like “judgment, decree or final order” and was conditional to the 
involvement of a substantial question of law as to the interpretation 
of the Government of India Act, 1935 or any Order in Council 
made thereunder, but criminal matters if involve such questions and 
order too is final in nature, then any such judgment, order or 
sentence could also be assailed before the Federal Court. Whereas 
under clause-31 of letters patent, any question of law, other than 
one related to interpretation of Act of 1935 or any order in Council 
made thereunder, could be made basis for a direct appeal before His 
Majesty in council if permission is granted by the High Court; that 
is the reason sub-section (1) of section 205 above says that it is the 
duty of High Court to consider in every case whether or not any 
such question is involved and of its own motion to give or to 
withhold a certificate accordingly. Likewise sub-section (2) of 
Section 205 above makes it clear that if any such certificate is given 
by the High Court, any party can appeal to Federal Court in 
following situations; 
i. that any such question as aforesaid has been wrongly decided; 
 
ii. on any ground on which that party could have appealed without special 
leave to His Majesty in Council if no such certificate had been given; 
 
iii. with the leave of the Federal Court, on any other ground; 
Finally, it was made clear in said sub-section (2) of section 205 that 
no direct appeal shall lie to His Majesty in Council, either with or 
without special leave; which saves the right of party to approach 
His Majesty in Council with the permission of High Court under 
clause-31 of letters patent, without routing to Federal Court, against 
any judgment, order or sentence of the High Court made in the 
exercise of original criminal jurisdiction or in any criminal case 
where any point or points of law have been reserved for the opinion 
of the said High Court and High Court declares that the case is a fit 
one for such appeal, and that the appeal be made under such 
conditions as the said High Court may establish or require.  

Crl.Misc.No.3200-M/2023 in Crl.A.No.55/2013. 7 
 
Through said Act pursuant to Section 206 it was authorized that 
The Federal Legislature may by Act provide that in such civil cases 
as may be specified in the Act an appeal shall lie to the Federal 
Court from a judgment decree or final order of a High Court in 
British India without any such certificate as mentioned in section 
205. This section however says that no appeal shall lie under any 
such Act unless following situations are met; 
(a) the amount or value of the subject matter of the dispute in the court 
of first instance and still in dispute on appeal was and is not less 
than fifty thousand rupees or such other sum not less than fifteen 
thousand rupees as may be specified by the Act, or the judgment 
decree or final order involves directly or indirectly some claim or 
question respecting property of the like amount or value; or  
 
(b) the Federal Court gives special leave to appeal. 
 
The above section authorizes for regulation of right of appeal and 
‘special leave to appeal’ in civil cases and that too if it is granted 
through an Act of Federal Legislature.  
7. 
Section 208 of said Act states that an appeal may be brought 
to His Majesty in Council from a decision of the Federal Court 
passed in its original jurisdiction in situations enumerated therein 
and in any other matter with the leave of Federal Court or His 
Majesty in Council and section 209 (3) of said Act says as under; 
(3) The Federal Court may, subject to such terms or conditions as 
it may think fit to impose, order a stay of execution in any case 
under appeal to the Court, pending the hearing of the appeal, and 
execution shall be stayed accordingly. 
The combined effect of above sections shows that Federal Court too 
had jurisdiction to stay the execution of sentence and right of appeal 
to Federal Court or His Majesty in Council was not a matter of 
course rather special circumstances when any point or points of law 
are reserved by High Court and declares the case fit to appeal; or 
any substantial question of law, relating to interpretation of any 
section of Government of India Act, 1935 or order passed by His 
Majesty in Council, is involved, therefore, when it was expedient 
for High Court to grant special leave to appeal under Clause-31 of 
the letters patent or to give a certificate under section 205 of the 

Crl.Misc.No.3200-M/2023 in Crl.A.No.55/2013. 8 
 
Government of India Act, 1935, it did not have power to suspend 
the sentence of accused, who was in confinement, enabling him to 
prefer such appeal.   
8. 
This was felt in a case reported as “Lala Jairam Das and others v. 
Emperor” [AIR (32) 1945 Privy Council 94] when Lord Russell of 
Killowen held that under section 426 or 561 of Cr.P.C. High Court 
has no power to grant bail to an accused who has been granted 
special leave to appeal to His majesty in Council or to Federal 
Court and it could only be done through legislation. Legislature 
duly responded when sub-section (2B) was inserted in section 426 
Cr.P.C. through following Act; 
The Code of Criminal Procedure (Second Amendment) Act, 
1946 (Act No. IV of 1946). 
(2B) Where a High Court is satisfied that a convicted person has 
been granted special leave to appeal to His Majesty in Council 
against any sentence which it has imposed or maintained, or has 
been granted leave to appeal to His Majesty in Council against an 
order of the Federal Court on an appeal from the High Court 
involving the imposition or maintenance of a sentence it may if it so 
thinks fit order that pending the appeal the sentence or order 
appealed against be suspended, and also, if the said person is in 
confinement, that he be released on bail. 
                                                                    (Underlined for emphasis) 
Through above provision, High Court was authorized to suspend 
the sentence in two situations; like when “special leave to appeal” is 
granted to His Majesty in Council against any sentence the High 
Court has imposed or maintained and “leave to appeal” to His 
Majesty in Council against an order of Federal Court. This 
difference between “special leave to appeal” and “leave to appeal” 
can well be comprehended from the situation that ‘special leave to 
appeal’ was usually granted by the High Court when any point or 
points of law are reserved as mentioned in Clause-31 of letters 
patent, or through issuance of certificate under section 205 of 
Government of India Act, 1935; whereas leave to appeal was 
simply granted in suitable cases by Federal Court or His Majesty in 
Council u/s 208 of Government of India Act, 1935.  

Crl.Misc.No.3200-M/2023 in Crl.A.No.55/2013. 9 
 
Such arrangement one can well imagine from the situation that 
Court of His Majesty in Council was at a distance of 6000 miles 
from the jurisdiction of High Court and there was only one Federal 
Court for whole of India. Thus, keeping in view the means of 
transportation and access of litigants to the concerned forums, it 
was a time taking and cumbersome exercise; therefore, this 
beneficial provision was enacted primarily to save those convicts 
who were languishing in the jail under petty sentences, lest they 
should not serve out their entire sentence in the meantime. 
9. 
After the advent of Pakistan in 1947, Government of India 
Act, 1935 was adopted as the Constitution of the Country through 
The Pakistan (Provisional Constitutional) Order, 1947; which 
provides for the establishment of the Federal Court. It was 
established under the Federal Court of Pakistan Order, 1948 at 
Karachi; therefore, Rules of Federal Court already in place were 
also adapted. Power of Federal Court to frame rules was enacted 
through The Federal Court Act, 1937 (Act XXV of 1937). After 
1937, another Act XXI of 1941 was passed with the title “The 
Federal Court Act, 1941” to empower the Federal Court to make 
rules with the approval of Governor-General for “regulating the 
presentation and prosecution of appeals lying to that Court, including rules 
relating to the furnishing of security for costs, the proceedings, if any, to be 
had in High Courts in connection with such appeals, and the preparation and 
transmission to the Federal Court of the records of such appeals”; and for 
that purpose to repeal those provisions of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908 which now regulate that matter. By virtue of said 
Act, section 111A of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and Rule 
17 of Order 45 of the First Schedule to the said Code was omitted 
which was primarily inserted through Government of India 
(Adaptation of Indian Laws) Order, 1937 whereby making the 
procedure of Privy Council appeals applicable to Federal Court 
Appeals, but the procedure was cumbersome and dilatory being 
meant for appeals to a Court 6000 miles away.  

Crl.Misc.No.3200-M/2023 in Crl.A.No.55/2013. 10 
 
10. 
Similarly, Federal Court (Supplemental Powers) Act, 1942 
(Act No. XXVI of 1942) was promulgated to give legal cover to 
rules for the delegation of certain powers of the Court to the 
Registrar as mentioned in order VIII Rule 1 of Federal Court Rules 
because doubts have been raised about the validity of this rule. 
Section 128 (2) (i), C.P.C. which gives such powers of delegation to 
the High Courts was not applicable to the Federal Court. It was 
doubtful whether section 214, Government of India Act, 1935 
covers the delegation of powers of the Court to one of its officials. 
Through said Act, Federal Court was authorized to delegate to the 
Registrar of the Court or any other official of the Court, by name or 
generally by designation, any judicial, quasi-judicial and non-
judicial duties and the Registrar or such official in the discharge of 
any such delegated duties shall have power to administer oath.   
11. 
Federal Court of Pakistan was established through the 
Federal Court of Pakistan Order, 1948 issued by the Governor 
General in exercise of the powers conferred by section 9 of the 
Indian Independence Act,1947 and of all other powers enabling him 
in that behalf. Through this Order it was ordained that Federal 
Court shall be deemed to have been established as from the 
appointed day (15th August, 1947) in accordance with the 
provisions contained in that behalf in the Government of India Act, 
1935 
as 
adapted 
by 
the 
Pakistan 
through 
(Provisional 
Constitutional) Order, 1947. The Rules of the Federal Court in 
force immediately before the appointed day were declared to be 
Rules of the Federal Court of Pakistan till such time the other rules 
are made by the Federal Court of Pakistan. By the time, Act 1 of 
1950 titled as Federal Court Enlargement of Jurisdiction Act, 1949 
was promulgated to provide for the enlargement of appellate 
jurisdiction of Federal Court in civil cases. Later Federal Court of 
Pakistan, in pursuance of the powers conferred on it by section 214 
of the Government of India Act, 1935 and section 3 of the Federal 
Court Act, 1941 and all other powers enabling in that behalf, with 

Crl.Misc.No.3200-M/2023 in Crl.A.No.55/2013. 11 
 
the approval of Governor General, made the Federal Court Rules, 
1950. 
12. 
Procedure for filing of appeals before Federal Court speaks 
through Order XII of Federal Court Rules, 1950 which says that 
next eight succeeding Orders in this part shall apply only to appeals 
brought to the Court under section 205 of the Government of India 
Act, 1935 unless they are applicable to other appeals. Next Orders 
of such Rules spilt into civil and criminal appeals with 
miscellaneous matters. Order XIX relates to criminal appeals and 
there was no concept of leave to appeal in criminal matters rather 
it was limited to civil matters only. On what matter criminal appeal 
lies, Rule-1 of said Order speaks as under; 
Where a High Court makes any final order in exercise of its criminal 
jurisdiction, whether original, appellate or revisional, and gives a 
certificate as is mentioned in section 205 of the Act, any party to the 
case may appeal to the Court within thirty days from the date of the 
order. 
Similarly Rule-7 of said Order talks about the stay of execution of 
any order in following terms; 
“Pending the disposal of any appeal under these Rules, the Court may 
order that the execution of the sentence or order appealed against be 
stayed or that the accused may be enlarged on bail on such terms as the 
Court may think fit.”  
There was no concept of granting leave to appeal in criminal 
matters by the Federal Court under above Rules, and while 
pending appeal Federal Court was competent to stay the execution 
of sentence. Thus, there remained clarity that applicability of sub-
section (2B) of section 426 Cr.P.C. was confined to the situation 
when special leave to appeal to the Federal Court is granted by the 
High Court in accordance with section 205 of the Government of 
India Act, 1935, and clause-31 of letters patent was parametria to 
it.    
13. 
Through Act XXVI of 1951 titled “Federal Laws (Revisions 
and Adaptation) Act, 1951” as per second schedule of the Act, 
amendment was introduced in sub-section (2B) of section 426 
Cr.P.C. and following text in sub-section was repealed:  

Crl.Misc.No.3200-M/2023 in Crl.A.No.55/2013. 12 
 
“or has been granted leave to appeal to His Majesty in Council against 
an order of the Federal Court on an appeal from the High Court 
involving the imposition or maintenance of a sentence”  
Similarly, as per third schedule of above Act, for the words “His 
Majesty in Council” where they first occur, the words “the Federal 
Court” were substituted; and final version of sub-section after 
amendment was as under; 
(2-B) Where a High Court is satisfied that a convicted person has been 
granted special leave to appeal to the Federal Court against any 
sentence which it has imposed or maintained, it may, if it so thinks fit 
order that pending the appeal the sentence or order appealed against be 
suspended and, also, if the said parson is in confinement, that he be 
released on bail. 
This amendment clearly brought Federal Court in the place of His 
Majesty in Council, and clause-31 of letters patent which was 
confined for right of appeal to His Majesty in Council was now to 
be read for remedy of appeal before Federal Court with the 
conditions enumerated therein. 
14. 
In year 1956, first Constitution of Pakistan was promulgated; 
‘Federal Court’ was redesignated as ‘Supreme Court’ and its 
jurisdiction in terms of original, appellate, review and advisory 
were defined. Article 157 of said Constitution counts the appellate 
jurisdiction of Supreme Court in matters involving interpretation of 
the Constitution; Article 157 (1) says as under:- 
“An appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any decree or final 
order of High Court in civil, criminal or other proceedings, if the High 
Court certifies that the case involves a substantial question of law as to 
interpretation of Constitution.” 
It was like special leave to appeal as earlier available under section 
205 of the Government of India Act, 1935. Article 157(2) of the 
Constitution also authorized the Supreme Court to grant special 
leave to appeal on the contours as mentioned in Article 157 (1) 
when the High Court refuses to give such certificate. Article 159 
finds mentioned appellate jurisdiction of Supreme Court in 
criminal matters and paragraph (c) provides right of appeal if 
High Court certifies that the case is fit one for appeal to the 
Supreme Court. This provision does not say anything about 
involvement of any substantial question of law as to the 

Crl.Misc.No.3200-M/2023 in Crl.A.No.55/2013. 13 
 
interpretation of the Constitution; therefore, it was partly like 
clause-31 of letters patent which says permission/leave to appeal 
can even be accorded by the High Court in a case where any point 
or points of law are reserved. 
15. 
Since the promulgation of Government of India Act, 1915 
and later instruments like letters patent, Government of India Act, 
1935, Rules of Federal Court and Article 157(2) of the Constitution 
of Pakistan, 1956, special leave to appeal was limited for its routing 
from High Court to the vertical level like Federal Court or His 
Majesty in Council but for the first time through the Constitution of 
Pakistan, 1956 the nature of “special leave to appeal” was explained 
as follows: - 
Article 160. Appeal to the Supreme Court by special leave of 
the Court.  
“Notwithstanding anything in this part, the Supreme Court may 
grant special leave to appeal from any judgment, decree, order or 
sentence of any court or tribunal in Pakistan, other than a court 
or tribunal constituted by or under any law relating to the armed 
forces.” 
It shows that Supreme Court could directly grant special leave to 
appeal from any judgment, decree, order or sentence of any court or 
tribunal.  
16. 
Through the Constitution of Pakistan, 1956, Federal Court 
though stood redesignated as Supreme Court but the words “Federal 
Court” remained part of Section 426 (2B) Cr.P.C. therefore, this 
sub-section remained redundant from year 1956 to 1961 until it was 
again amended through President’s Order No.1 of 1961; Central 
Laws (Adaptation) Order, 1961 whereby “Federal Court” was 
replaced by “Supreme Court”. Similarly, for authorizing Supreme 
Court to make rules, The Federal Court Act, 1937 (Act No. XXV 
OF 1937), was later amended by A.O., 1961, (Art. 2 and 
Schedule)., and “Federal Court” was substituted by “Supreme 
Court” in following terms: -  
2. Power of [Supreme Court] to make rules. The [Supreme Court] 
may make rules for regulating the service of processes issued by the 

Crl.Misc.No.3200-M/2023 in Crl.A.No.55/2013. 14 
 
Court, including rules requiring a High Court from which an appeal has 
been preferred to [Supreme Court] to serve any process issued by the 
[Supreme Court] in connection with that appeal. 
                       This amendment was given effect from the 23rd March, 1956. 
 
17. 
In year 1956, Supreme Court Rules were made pursuant to 
constitutional mandate under new Constitution whereby Article 160 
of the Constitution had introduced the remedy through “Special 
Leave to appeal” therefore, for the first time for criminal matters 
Order XXIV in the Rules was kept in place for procedure in filing 
petitions and applications for “special leave to appeal” before the 
Supreme Court. Supreme Court Rules 1956 were also amended in 
the terms that the Supreme Court was granted following power as 
per Rule 5-B of Order XXIV; 
“Pending the disposal of a petition under this Order the Court may 
direct that execution of any order for imprisonment or fine against 
which leave to appeal is sought, be stayed, on such terms as the Court 
may think fit; 
Provided that unless surrender is first made to an order of imprisonment 
as above, the petition shall not be posted for hearing, nor shall 
operation of such order be stayed.” 
Proviso with respect to surrender of accused is indicative of fact that if 
the accused is on bail by the order of High Court under sub-section 
(2B) of section 426 Cr.P.C. he must appear before the Court otherwise 
execution of sentence shall not be stayed. Similar course is adopted 
when any accused convicted by learned trial court is allowed bail for 
filing appeal to the next forum as per section 382A Cr.P.C.  
18.    By the promulgation of Constitution of Pakistan, 1962, the 
appellate jurisdiction of Supreme Court was redefined as mentioned in 
Article 58 as under: - 
(1) Subject to this Article, the Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction to 
hear and determine appeals from judgments, decrees, orders or 
sentences of a High Court. 
 
(2) An Appeal to the Supreme Court from a judgment, decree, order or 
sentence of a High Court shall lie as of right where— 
 
(a) the High Court certifies that the case involves a substantial 
question of law as to the interpretation of this Constitution: 
 

Crl.Misc.No.3200-M/2023 in Crl.A.No.55/2013. 15 
 
(b) the High Court has sentenced a person to death or for 
transportation of life: or 
 
(c) the High Court has imposed punishment on a person in 
pursuance of powers conferred on the Court by Article 123.  
 
(3) An appeal to the Supreme Court from a judgment, decree, order or 
sentence of a High Court in a case to which clause (2) of this Article 
does not apply shall lie only if the Supreme Court grants leave to 
appeal. 
Article 157 (2) & Article 160 of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1956 
were dropped relating to “special leave to appeal” rather as per 
Article 58 (3) of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1962 a conditional 
right of appeal was granted if the Supreme Court grants “leave to 
appeal”.  This change in Constitution with respect to “special leave 
to appeal” into “leave to appeal” leaves an impression that framers 
of Constitution realized that right of “special leave to appeal” was 
already being regulated in terms mentioned in Article 157 (1) and 
159 of the Constitution of Pakistan,1956 like in a situation when 
High Court certifies that the case involves a substantial question of 
law as to interpretation of the Constitution or case is fit one for 
appeal to the Supreme Court; therefore, Article 160 was 
superfluous. The merger of Articles 157 & 159 of Constitution of 
Pakistan,1956, transformed into Article 58 in new Constitution of 
Pakistan, 1962. Though remedy through “Special leave to appeal” 
under the Constitution of Pakistan, 1962 was omitted but Supreme 
Court Rules, 1956 kept this remedy alive which shows that ‘special 
leave to appeal’ would only be confined to a situation when High 
Court  through certificate declares that case is fit to be assailed 
before Supreme Court if  it involves a substantial question of law as 
to the interpretation of the Constitution, which is further fortified by 
the Supreme Court Rules, 1956 which remined operative despite 
promulgation of new Constitution of Pakistan, 1962 and body of 
these rules wherever necessary was later amended in year 1964 & 
1965.  
19.    Order XXIV of said Rules refers to “special leave to appeal” 
in criminal cases; it is reproduced as under: - 
                                            

Crl.Misc.No.3200-M/2023 in Crl.A.No.55/2013. 16 
 
ORDER XXIV 
PETITONS FOR SPECIAL LEAVE TO APPEAL IN 
CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS 
1. Saved as hereinafter provided the provisions with respect to 
petitions for special leave to appeal in civil proceedings contained 
in Order XIII of this Part of the Rules, shall, with necessary 
modifications and adaptations apply to applications one for 
special leave to appeal in criminal matters: 
Provided that no court-fee, or process-fee or search fee shall 
be charged and no copying charges shall be made except for 
copies other than the first to any party to the proceedings. 
2. All petitions and applications for special leave to appeal in 
criminal matters shall be lodged in the Court within thirty days 
from the date of the judgment or order sought to be appealed or 
from the date of the refusal of certificate under Article 58(2) (a) of 
the Constitution by the High Court: 
Provided that the Court may for sufficient cause shown 
extend the time. 
“Exception: The period of limitation for a petition for special 
leave to appeal instituted by the Advocate-General, of a Province 
against an order of acquittal by the High Court shall be sixty 
days.” 
Sub Rule-2 above which refers Article 58 of the Constitution of 
Pakistan, 1962 can well be understood that it clearly speaks about 
“special leave to appeal” and “not leave to appeal” which could 
have been mentioned because by the time, the words “leave to 
appeal” have been introduced through Constitution of Pakistan, 
1962 as per Article 58 (3) cited in preceding paragraph. Of course, 
there is a difference between remedy by way of “special leave to 
appeal” and “leave to appeal” because both remedies were 
differently mentioned in Clause-31 of letters patent as cited in 
paragraph-5 above and also in Government of India Act, 1935 if 
sections 205 to 209 are read in conjunction.  
20.  A remedy for “special leave to appeal” is not an omnibus 
remedy rather true meanings of special leave are “leave granted on 
special grounds” and issuance of certificate for fitness to appeal on 
special grounds is one mode of the grant of special leave to appeal; 
therefore, when High Court in a criminal case permits to appeal to 
the Supreme Court from the sentence of High Court on special 

Crl.Misc.No.3200-M/2023 in Crl.A.No.55/2013. 17 
 
grounds, the High Court may, in its discretion, suspend the sentence 
and grant bail pending the appeal. However, if “special leave to 
appeal” and “leave to appeal” be considered as having no difference 
as referred in case reported as “TALIB HUSSAIN Versus The STATE and 
others” (PLD 2014 Lahore 574), then Supreme Court while 
pending petition for leave to appeal and after granting leave to 
appeal has like power under Supreme Court Rules to suspend the 
execution of any sentence which in turn excludes the application of 
sub-section (2B) of section 426 Cr.P.C. in such proceedings. Thus, 
applicability of such sub-section kept confined to the extent of 
‘special leave to appeal’ granted by the High Court through a 
fitness certificate, that is the reason, it is still on the statute book 
and legislature has not swapped the words “special leave to appeal” 
with the words “leave to appeal” in sub-section (2B) of 426 Cr.P.C.  
21. 
This situation continues even after promulgation of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 wherein 
Article 185(3) also identifies the words” leave to appeal” and Order 
XXIII of Supreme Court Rules, 1980, relating to petition for leave 
to appeal, does contain the power to stay the execution of any order 
for imprisonment etc., as per rule-8 of said Order. However, 
through Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972, a forum of appeal before a 
Division Bench of High Court was provided against the conviction 
and sentence passed by the High Court in its original criminal 
jurisdiction, which earlier was His Majesty in Council as per 
clause-31 of the letters patent. For reference section 411A Cr.P.C. 
is reproduced; 
411-A. Appeal from sentence of High Court: (1) Except in cases in 
which an appeal lies to the Supreme Court under Article 185 of the 
Constitution any person convicted on a trial held by a High Court in the 
exercise of its original criminal jurisdiction may, notwithstanding 
anything contained in Section 418 or Section 423, sub-section (2), or in 
the Letters Patent of any High Court, appeal to the High Court-  
(a) against the conviction on any ground of appeal which involves a 
matter of law only;  
(b) with the leave of the Appellate Court or upon the certificate of the 
Judge who tried case that it is a fit case for appeal, against the 
conviction on any ground of appeal which involves a matter of fact 

Crl.Misc.No.3200-M/2023 in Crl.A.No.55/2013. 18 
 
only, or a matter of mixed law and fact, or any other ground which 
appears to the Appellate Court to be a sufficient ground of appeal; and  
(c) with the leave of the Appellate Court, against the sentence passed 
unless the sentence is, one fixed by law. 
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 417, the Provincial 
Government may direct the Public Prosecutor to present an appeal to 
the High Court from any order of acquittal passed by the High Court in 
the exercise of its original criminal jurisdiction, and such appeal may 
notwithstanding anything contained in Section 418, or Section 423, 
subsection (2), or in the Letters Patent of any High Court, but subject to 
the restrictions imposed by clause (b) and clause (c) of sub-section (1) 
of this section on an appeal against a conviction, lie on a matter of fact 
as well as a matter of law.  
(3) Notwithstanding anything elsewhere contained in any Act or 
Regulation an appeal under this section shall be heard by a Division 
Court of the High Court composed of not less than two Judges, being 
Judges other than the Judge or Judges by whom the original trial was 
held; and if the constitution of such a Division Court impracticable, the 
High Court shall report the circumstances to the Provincial Government 
which shall take action with a view to the transfer of the appeal under 
Section 527 to another' High Court.  
(4) Subject to such rules as may from time to time tie made by the 
Supreme Court in this behalf, and to such conditions as the High Court 
may establish or require, an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from 
any order made on appeal under sub-section (1) by a Division Court of 
the High Court in respect of which order the High Court declares that 
The matter is a fit one of such appeal. 
With the insertion of this section, appeal against sentence passed 
by High Court in exercise of original criminal jurisdiction was 
directed to be filed before Division Bench of High Court, if it 
involves a question of law, or with the leave of Bench which held 
the trial, upon the fitness certificate for appeal, or against a 
sentence not fixed by law, and in this way clause-31 of letters 
patent has become partly redundant. Whereas for section 205 of 
Government of India Act, 1935, the corresponding provision is 
available in the form of Article 185 (2) (f) of the Constitution of 
the Islamic republic of Pakistan, 1973, i.e., special right of appeal 
with certificate that case involves a substantial question of law as 
to the interpretation of the Constitution.  
 22. 
It is apparent that in the present scheme of law, sub-section 
(2B) of 426 Cr.P.C. shall remain applicable only when the High 
Court certifies that case involves a substantial question of law as to 
interpretation of the Constitution and a person earns a right of 
appeal to the Supreme Court which of course is a “special leave to 

Crl.Misc.No.3200-M/2023 in Crl.A.No.55/2013. 19 
 
appeal” as mentioned in sub-section (2B) of section 426 Cr.P.C. On 
the contrary if the High court refuses to issue such certificate, the 
leave to appeal (not special leave to appeal) shall be available to the 
aggrieved as mentioned in rule-2 of Order XXIII of Supreme Court 
Rules 1980, which is reproduced; 
2. A Petition for leave to appeal in criminal matter shall be lodged 
within thirty days from the date of judgment or final order sought to 
be appealed from, or as the case may be, from the date of the order 
refusing certificate under sub-clause (f) of clause (2) of Article 185 
of the Constitution:                                                (emphasis supplied) 
23. 
More or less similar view was expressed by Allahabad High 
Court in case reported as “Gore Lal and Others. vs State” AIR 1958 All 
667; equivalent citation 1958 Cri. LJ 1107. which is as under: - 
“In other words, the High Court has no statutory or inherent power to 
grant bail to, or suspend the execution of the sentence of, a person 
whose conviction and sentence it has maintained, except where that 
person has been granted special leave to appeal under Article 136 of the 
Constitution, and in no other case. Indeed, except for the purpose of 
granting a certificate under Article 132(1) or Article 134(1)(c) of the 
Constitution, or granting bail or suspending the sentence under Section 
426 (2B) of the Code, the High Court becomes functus officio. 
Attention might be drawn to the fact that any other view would result, 
as pointed out in Jairam Das case (A), in defeating the ends of justice in 
certain circumstances and in an alteration by the High Court of its 
judgment contrary to Section 369 of the Code.” 
Above view was further fortified when while exhaustively dealing 
with the issue by High Court of Andhra Pradesh in a case reported 
as “Madan Lal Versus The State” (AIR 1960 AP 622), it had ruled that 
applicability of sub-section (2B) of section 426 Cr.P.C. is 
conditional to grant of fitness certificate by the High Court for 
appeal to Supreme Court.          
         The confusion was finally eliminated when later in Indian 
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, in the corresponding section 
389 parametria to section 426 Cr.P.C., provision like sub-section 
(2B) was omitted.  
23.    The above discussion leaves no further confusion that sub-
section (2B) of section 426 Cr.P.C. is parametria to section 382A 
Cr.P.C. which is further reflected from the enacted sequence of sub-
sections 2, 2A & 2B in section 426 Cr.P.C.; all sub-sections are of 

Crl.Misc.No.3200-M/2023 in Crl.A.No.55/2013. 20 
 
same kind dealing with different situations in which accused seeks 
bail enabling him to present appeal against the impugned judgment 
of conviction. If it was a different provision for vesting a special 
jurisdiction on High Court, then it could have been numbered 
differently within the section 426 Cr.P.C. which is usually required 
in the format of an enactment pursuant to legislative drafting 
technique which is mentioned in “LEGISLATIVE DRAFTING MANUAL 
HANDBOOK FOR PARLIAMENTARY LEGISLATIVE DRAFTERS January 2019” 
issued by Pakistan Institute for Parliamentary Services, explanation 
is as follows; 
                         (35) While amending an Act, certain provisions are to be substituted, 
added, inserted or omitted, but the words “inserted” and “added” are 
often confused while giving the command in an amending Bill. The 
golden rule is that if something is sandwiched in the same genre then it 
would be inserted and if genre is not same then added. For instance, if 
one more sub-section is added after the last sub-section then it would be 
added because after last sub-section, new section starts hence the genre 
changes.                                                                   (emphasis supplied) 
 
For sub-section (2B) in section 426 Cr.P.C., the amending Act titled 
“The Code of Criminal Procedure (Second Amendment) Act, 1946 
(Act No. IV of 1946)” used the word “inserted” and not “added”. 
The guidance is also sought from a Book titled “Drafting Matters: 
Guidance” of Scottish Government, available at https://www.gov. 
scot:drafting-matters. Its Part-1 relating to drafting technique says 
as under; 
“to adding a provision at the end of an existing series of provisions of 
the same kind (for example, a subsection at the end of a section or a 
schedule at the end of the schedules) the numbering should continue in 
sequence from the last existing number.”                       (emphasis supplied)                         
That is the reason, legislature for showing sub-section (2B) as 
provision of same kind inserted it after sub-section 2A in section 
426 Cr.P.C.  
24. Through section 205 of Government of India Act, 1935, when 
the High Court certifies to file an appeal before the Federal Court 
which of course was a special leave to appeal to the Federal Court 
and when by virtue of section 209(3) of said Act, Federal Court was 
authorized to stay execution of any sentence on filing an appeal 

Crl.Misc.No.3200-M/2023 in Crl.A.No.55/2013. 21 
 
from the judgment of the High Court, therefore, there was no 
necessity to insert sub-section (2B) in section 426 Cr.P.C. because 
purpose was already being served. This provision was, therefore, 
introduced in year 1946 for those convicts whom special leave to 
appeal to His Majesty in Council was granted by the High Court 
and it is learnt that Court of His Majesty in council was 6000 miles 
away, therefore, it was expected that by the time appeal is filed, lest 
convict should not serve out his entire sentence. His Majesty in 
Council remained part of Federal Court Rules, because on granting 
leave to appeal by the Federal Court one can file appeal before His 
Majesty in Council against the Judgment of Federal Court. Under 
Order XIX Rule-7 of Federal Court Rules, 1950, the Federal Court 
was authorized to stay the execution of sentence pending the appeal 
against the judgment of High Court. With the promulgation of 
Constitution of Pakistan, 1956, remedy before His Majesty in 
Council was eliminated but the appellate forum for High Court was 
designated as Supreme Court. Similarly, under Order XXIV Rule 5-
B of Supreme Court Rules, 1956 and Order XXIII Rule 8, of 
Supreme Court Rules 1980, the power to stay the execution of any 
sentence was available to the Supreme Court at the time when 
petition for leave to appeal is filed or leave is granted by the 
Supreme Court; therefore, there is no need to recourse to the High 
court for suspension of sentence.   
25. 
Even otherwise the word ‘may’ used in sub-section (2B) of 
section 426 Cr.P.C. makes it discretionary to grant bail to the 
seekers, and High Court can well refuse the same as held in case 
reported as “Ahmad Sher alias Sheri Bhatti Versus The State, etc.” (2014 
PSC (Crl.) 411), and in an unreported judgment of Supreme Court 
passed in a case titled “Muhammad Zulfiqar versus The State, etc.” 
(Criminal Petition No. 252-L of 2014). Similar view was followed 
by the High Courts while refusing bail to the accused sentenced by 
it, considering that High Court being functus officio cannot grant 
bail for pending appeal before Supreme Court, particularly when 
earlier such relief was refused by the High Court pending appeal 

Crl.Misc.No.3200-M/2023 in Crl.A.No.55/2013. 22 
 
before the High court. Reliance is on cases reported as “NIAZ BEEN 
and others Versus THE STATE” (PLD 2018 PESHAWAR 131); “ADIL 
MANSOOR Versus The STATE and 2 others” [2017 MLD 1046 (LHR)]; 
“MUHAMMAD IJAZ Versus The STATE and another” [2013 P Cr. L J 
1102 (LHR)]. 
26. 
For what has been discussed above, we see no ground to 
invoke sub-section (2B) of Section 426 Cr.P.C.; the instant petition, 
therefore, is dismissed.
