------------------------ 
 
 
AALIA NEELUM, J:- The appellant-Arshad Ali, son of 
Ahmad Ali, caste Rajpoot Deendar, resident of village Bukkan Kalaan, 
police station Vanike Tarar, District Hafizabad, was involved in case F.I.R. 
No.174 of 2018, dated 24.05.2018, an offence under Section 302 P.P.C., 
registered at P.S. Vanike Tarar, District Hafizabad and was tried by the 
learned Addl. Sessions Judge (MCTC), District Hafizabad. The learned trial 
court seized with the matter in terms of the judgment dated 21.05.2019 and 
convicted Arshad Ali (the appellant) under Section 302(b) PPC as Tazir 
and sentenced to Death for committing Qatl-e-Amd of Niaz Ali (deceased), 
with the direction to pay compensation of Rs.2,00,000/- to the legal heirs of 
the deceased as envisaged under section 544-A of Cr.P.C and in case of 
default thereof, to further undergo 06-months S.I.  
2. 
 
Feeling aggrieved by the judgment of the learned trial court, 
Arshad Ali, the appellant, has assailed his conviction by filing instant jail 
appeal bearing Criminal Appeal No.47011-J of 2019. The learned trial court 

Murder Reference No.159 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.47011-J of 2019 
 
2
also referred M.R. No.159 of 2019 (The State. Vs. Arshad Ali) for 
confirmation of the death sentence awarded to the appellant-Arshad Ali. The 
matters arising from the same judgment of the learned trial court are being 
disposed of through a single judgment.       
3. 
 
The prosecution story, as alleged in the F.I.R (Ex. PA/1) lodged 
on the application (Ex. PA) of Akhtar Ali (PW-10)-the complainant, is that 
four months prior, the complainant’s nephew Safdar Ali married with Mst. 
Hameeda Ahmad, daughter of Ahmad Ali, who, due to a quarrel, came to the 
house of her parents at Bukan Kalan on 09.05.2018. On 23.05.2018, the 
complainant, along with his brothers, Niaz Ali (the deceased) and Zafar Ali 
(PW-11), came to the parents’ house of Mst. Hameeda Bibi and demanded 
from Arshad Ali (the appellant), the real brother of Mst. Hameeda Bibi to 
send their daughter-in-law with them; after that, Arshad Ali (the appellant) 
became furious and refused to send his sister. They beseeched Arshad Ali 
(the appellant) to reconcile the matter and to send Mst. Hameeda Ahmad 
with them, but he was not ready to do so. They all slept in the courtyard 
where the energy saver bulb was lightening. Suddenly, at about 02:30 a.m., 
Arshad Ali (the appellant) came out of his residential room while raising 
Lalkaras to teach a lesson about quarreling with his sister; on hearing the 
voice, the complainant (PW-10) and his brother Zafar Ali (PW-11) woke up 
and saw Arshad Ali (the appellant) armed with pistol 30 bore while making 
straight firing at Niaz Ali (the deceased), who was sleeping there on a cot 
nearby. Two fire shots hit the left side of the neck and two on the right 
shoulder of Niaz Ali (the deceased). The complainant (PW-10) and Zafar Ali 
(PW-11) wanted to step forward to rescue their brother; after that, Arshad 
Ali made a straight fire upon them, but they saved them by moving them 
right and left. Arshad Ali (the appellant) accused, fled away from the spot by 
waiving his pistol and extending murderous threats. Niaz Ali (the deceased) 
succumbed to the injuries at the spot.  
4. 
 
The motive behind the occurrence was that Arshad Ali accused, 
had been suspected of quarrels and cruelty with his sister Mst. Hameeda Bibi 

Murder Reference No.159 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.47011-J of 2019 
 
3
on the part of Niaz Ali and others, due to which he committed the 
occurrence.  
5. 
 
After the incident, the complainant reported the matter to the 
police through the written application (Ex. PA); after that, formal F.I.R 
(Ex.PA/1) was chalked out by Gulzar Hussain S.I (PW-2). After registration 
of the case, the investigation was entrusted to Azhar Hussain, S.I. (PW-8)-
the investigating officer, who, having found the accused/appellant guilty, 
prepared a report under Section 173, Cr.P.C., and sent the same to the court 
of competent jurisdiction. On 13.08.2018, the learned trial court formally 
charged the appellant, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In 
support of its version, the prosecution produced as many as eleven (11) 
witnesses.  
6. 
 
Ocular account, in this case, has come out from the statements 
of Akhtar Ali (PW-10)-the complainant, and Zafar Ali (PW-11)-the eye 
witness, whereas Dr. Usama Bin Yousaf, Medical Officer, DHQ Hospital, 
Hafizabad (PW-1), who conducted the postmortem examination of Niaz Ali 
(the deceased) found the following injuries on his person: -                    
INJURIES 
1) 
Firearm entry wound 1 cm x 0.5 cm on left 
side of neck, 1.5 cm away from left ear lobe. 
Inverted edges with blackening,  
2) 
Firearm wound of entry 1.5 cm x 0.8 cm on 
left side of neck 3.5 cm away from left ear 
lobe. Inverted edges with blackening,  
3) 
Firearm wound of exit 1 cm x 0.5 cm on right 
side of neck near clavicle 5 cm away from 
right ear lobe. Edges were everted,  
4) 
Firearm wound exit 1 cm x 0.5 cm on right 
side of neck, near clavicle, 6.10 cm away from 
right ear lobe. Edges are everted.   
5) 
Firearm wound of entry 1 cm x 0.5 cm on 
right shoulder, edges were inverted with 
blackening,  

Murder Reference No.159 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.47011-J of 2019

6) 
Firearm wound of exit 1.5 cm x 1 cm on right 
posterior axillary line, 9.5 cm away from right 
nipple. Edges were everted,  
7) 
Firearm wound of entry 3 cm x 1 cm on right 
arm, 5.5 cm away from right shoulder joint. 
Edges were inverted with blackening,  
8) 
Firearm wound of entry 1 cm x 0.5 cm on 
right back side of head, 1 cm away from right 
ear lobe. Edges were inverted with blackening,  
9) 
Firearm wound of exit.  
 
After conducting the postmortem examination, the 
doctor opined that cause of death was due to the excessive 
hemorrhage and irreversible neurogenic shock due to injuries 
No.1 2, which were sufficient to cause death in the ordinary 
course of nature. All the injuries were ante-mortem. The 
probable time between injury and death was within five 
minutes, and between death and postmortem was 16 hours.  
The statements of the remaining prosecution witnesses are formal in nature.  
7. 
 
The learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor gave up PWs, 
Sajjad Haider 201/C, Mukhtar Ahmad 744/C, and Muhammad Ramzan as 
being unnecessary and closed the prosecution evidence after tendering the 
reports of Forensic D.N.A and Serology Analysis report (Ex.PS) and 
Firearms and tool mark examination report (Ex. PT). 
8. 
 
The appellant was also examined under Section 342 Cr.P.C., 
wherein he neither opted to appear as his own witness under section 340(2) 
Cr.P.C nor opted to produce any evidence in defence. In response to a 
particular question that why this case was against him and why the PWs 
deposed against him, the appellant made the following deposition: -           
“I had no motive to kill Niaz Ali deceased. I was not 
present at the time of occurrence at the place of 
occurrence, as during the days of occurrence, I used 
to sleep in my tailoring shop at Vanike Tarar. Some 
unknown persons committed the occurrence. I have 

Murder Reference No.159 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.47011-J of 2019 
 
5
been falsely involved in the case, by the I.O. in 
connivance with the complainant and eye witnesses, 
after calling them from their village, to get rid of the 
untraceable accused. I am infirm being chronic 
patient of Tuberculosis. I filed application before this 
Court, regarding my illness and requested to 
constitute medical board, upon which the jail Doctor 
submitted report, copy of which is Ex.DA, to the 
Court that medication had been started. I have been 
under treatment at Services Hospital, Lahore, and 
other various hospitals from where I was issued 
prescriptions, time to time, photocopies of which are 
produced as Mark-DA/1-21 regarding my disease. I 
being patient of many diseases including paralysis was 
unable to easily walk and even move at the time of 
occurrence, what to say about killing a person and 
fleeing away from the scene, in alleged presence of 
PWs who are healthy and well built. It was an unseen 
occurrence, the PWs being closely related to the 
deceased have falsely deposed against me.” 
 
9. 
 
After evaluating the evidence available on record in light of 
arguments advanced from both sides, the learned trial court found the 
prosecution version proved beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt, which 
resulted in the appellant's conviction in the aforestated terms.  
10. 
 
We have given our anxious and most thoughtful consideration 
to both sides’ rival submissions. We have minutely gone through the 
evidence on record.  
11. 
 
The occurrence occurred at 2:30 a.m. (night) on 24.05.2018 in 
the area of village Bukkan Kalaan situated within the jurisdiction of Police 
Station Vanike Tarar, District Hafizabad, which is at a distance of one 
kilometer only from the place of occurrence and is connected by mettled 
road. The two eye-witnesses, namely, Akhtar Ali (PW-10)-the complainant, 
and Zafar Ali (PW-11), had allegedly seen the occurrence. After the 
commission of the crime, they had also seen the accused running away from 
the spot. Akhtar Ali (PW-10)-the complainant informed the police about the 
occurrence through the written application (Exh. PA), and formal F.I.R. 
(Exh.PA/1) was chalked out at 05:00 a.m. on 24.05.2018 by Gulzar Hussain 

Murder Reference No.159 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.47011-J of 2019 
 
6
S.I. (PW-2). The delay of 2 1/2 hours in filing an FIR in the instant case, 
irrespective of the fact that the Police Station is situated only at a distance of 
one kilometer from the spot of the incident, creates sufficient doubt about 
the genuineness of the FIR. The matter can also be examined from another 
angle; in the inquest report (Exh. PJ) in column No.3, related to the time of 
information received about the occurrence, it was mentioned that FIR was 
registered at 05:00 a.m. on 24.05.2018. The contents of column No.3 are 
reproduced hereunder,  
 ”

It is mentioned in column No.1 of the inquest report (Exh. PL) 
that the dead body was recovered from the area of Bukkan Kalan. It is not 
mentioned therein that the dead body was found lying in the accused’s 
house. We further noticed that Doctor Usama Bin Yousaf (PW-1), who 
conducted the post-mortem-examination upon the dead body of Niaz Ali 
deceased, had noted the rigor mortis present on the dead body of the 
deceased. The mouth and eyes were semi-open. We noticed that death had 
not taken place at the time given by the prosecution witnesses, nor witnesses 
were present at the spot, which also got support from the inquest report 
(Exh. PJ) wherein the names of Akhtar Ali (PW-10)-the complainant and 
Zafar Ali (PW-11) were not mentioned. It indicated that the incident did not 
occur as stated by the prosecution. All these factual circumstances lead to 
the conclusion that relying upon the FIR in the instant case is unsafe. Other 
essential facts on this case are that the Inquest Report (Exh. PJ) was 
prepared on 24.05.2018, but the preparation time was not mentioned therein. 
Azhar Hussain S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer deposed during cross-
examination that,  
“We reached the spot at about 6:30 a.m.”  
 
 
If Azhar Hussain S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer, had 
reached the place of occurrence at 06:30 a.m. and prepared an inquest report 
(Exh. PJ), there is no reason that why the post mortem of the dead body of 

Murder Reference No.159 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.47011-J of 2019 
 
7
Niaz Ali-the deceased was conducted on 24.05.2018 at 06:30 p.m. with the 
delay of approximately twelve hours. More significantly, the inquest Report 
(Exh. PJ) does not bear any signatures of the witnesses. Also, at the bottom, 
on the last page, the names of the prosecution witnesses were not mentioned. 
In column No.4 names of Safdar Ali (PW-9) and Muhammad Ramzan 
(given up PW) were mentioned. Safdar Ali (PW-9), son of the deceased 
Niaz Ali, deposed during cross-examination that he reached Bukkan Kalan 
at about 06:00 a.m. Safdar Ali (PW-9) deposed during cross-examination 
that: - 
 “I reached Bukan Kalan at about 6:00 a.m, 
after the occurrence.----------I came to know 
about the occurrence at about 2:45 a.m. Police 
reached the place of occurrence at about 6:00 
a.m.-----------Dead body was shifted from the 
spot at about 12:00/12:30 noon. I left the place 
of occurrence at about 12:00/12:30 noon.”  
 
 
 
Bashir Ahmed 391/C (PW-5) escorted the dead body of Niaz 
Ali to DHQ Hospital Hafizabad. Bashir Ahmed 391/C (PW-5) deposed 
during cross-examination: - 
“I reached at DHQ, Hospital at 05:00 pm.  I 
shifted the dead body on private vehicle.------IO 
handed over the police papers to doctor at 
05:30/06:00 pm.”  
 
 
 
From the deposition of Akhtar Ali (PW-10)-the complainant, 
Zafar Ali (PW-11), and Safdar Ali (PW-9), it is established that the FIR had 
been registered after due consultation and deliberation by the complainant 
(PW-10). No explanation is coming forward as to why the complainant 
(PW-10) had not informed the police about the incident soon after the 
incident. The inordinate delay of about two hours and thirty minutes from 
the time of the commission of the offence remained unexplained and 
rendered the whole of the prosecution version doubtful.  The Hon’ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan held in the case of Iftikhar Hussain and another 
v. The State (2004 SCMR 1185) that: - 

Murder Reference No.159 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.47011-J of 2019

 “As far as F.I.R. under section 154, Cr.P.C. 
itself is concerned, it is always treated to be a 
cornerstone of the prosecution case to establish 
guilt against culprits involved in the crime. 
Thus it has got a very significant role to play. If 
there is any doubt in lodging of F.I.R. and 
commencement of investigation, it gives rise to a 
doubt in benefit of which, of course, cannot be 
extended to anyone else except to the accused. 
However, an F.I.R. under section 154, Cr.P.C. 
which has been lodged after conducting an 
inquiry loses its evidentiary value--------.” 
 
12. 
 
In the instant case, as stated above, the occurrence occurred at 
2:30 a.m. (night) on 24.05.2018; the inter-se distance between the place of 
occurrence and the police station is one kilometer. At the same time, F.I.R. 
(Exh.PA/1) was got registered on the written complaint (Exh. PA) of Akhtar 
Ali (PW-10)-the complainant, at 05:00 a.m. on 24.05.2018. It is notable that 
Akhtar Ali (PW-10)-the complainant deposed during examination-in-chief 
as under:- 
"I moved an application for registration of case 
Ex.PA which bears my signature." 
 
From the evidence of Akhtar Ali (PW-10)-the complainant) it 
reveals that after the incident, the complainant (PW-10) straightaway went to 
the police station to report the incident to the police, whereas during cross-
examination, Akhtar Ali (PW-10)-the complainant, deposed that:- 
"After the occurrence, firstly I attended the 
deceased, then I go scribed the complaint Ex.PA 
and went to P.S I got scribed the complaint 
from a villager at the spot, about one or two 
hours after the occurrence. I am matriculate. I 
cannot remember the name of the person who 
scribed 
the 
complaint 
Ex.PA. 
Place 
of 
occurrence is at a distance of one kilometer 
from P.S Vanike Tarar. I went to P.S on a 
motorcycle. Two other persons were with me 
when I went to P.S. We were on two 
motorcycles. We stayed at P.S for about half an 
hour. I do not know the names of both the 
persons who went with me to P.S. " 

Murder Reference No.159 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.47011-J of 2019

Zafar Ali (PW-11)-eye witness deposed during cross-
examination as under: - 
"Akhtar complainant got scribed the complaint 
Ex.PA 
at 
about 
5:00 
a.m…..Akhtar 
complainant left the spot to inform the police at 
about 5:00/5:30 a.m." 
 
As per the prosecution, the complainant (PW-10) went to the 
police station to report the incident, but before visiting the police station, the 
complainant got prepared an application for registration of a criminal case 
from "someone" whose name was not known to him. Non-mentioning this 
fact in the application/complaint (Ex. PA) indicates that the complainant 
(PW-10) had not stated the complete truth and that the F.I.R. came into 
existence after due deliberations and consultations. When and where the 
complaint (Ex. PA) was prepared, and the author of the complaint should 
have to state that he prepared the complaint under the instructions of the 
complainant. It is also not a case of the prosecution that the complainant 
(PW-10) asked “someone” (unknown) to prepare a complaint. Accordingly, 
the complaint was prepared by “someone” (unknown), which was shown to 
the complainant, read over to him, which the complainant signed and thumb 
marked. Even the complainant had not given any explanation regarding the 
preparation of the complaint in the complaint and his statement before the 
learned trial court; therefore, in these circumstances, the chance of 
consultations and deliberations on the part of the complainant cannot be 
ruled out. It creates a dent in the prosecution case. 
13. 
 
We have noted a conflict between the statements of material 
witnesses regarding the length of time of stay of the investigating officer at 
the spot and the recording of statements of witnesses. Safdar Ali (PW-9) 
deposed that: - 
“Police stayed at the spot till 11:00/12:00 noon.” 
 
 
Whereas, Akhtar Ali (PW-10)-the complainant deposed during 
examination-in-chief that: - 

Murder Reference No.159 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.47011-J of 2019 
 
10
“The I.O along with 3 /4 other policemen, came 
to the place of occurrence and stayed there till 
1:00/2:00 p.m.” 
 
 
It also comes in the evidence of Azhar Hussain S.I. (PW-8)-
investigating officer, that he prepared an un-scaled site plan of the place of 
occurrence, Ex. PR. The un-scaled site plan reveals that the accused fired at 
the deceased by standing at point “B,” and crime empties were secured from 
the same point. In the un-scaled site plan, Ex.PR presence of witnesses was 
shown, but the cots of the prosecution witnesses were not revealed. Azhar 
Hussain S.I. (PW-8)-investigating officer admitted during cross-examination 
that: -  
“I have not drawn the sketches of cots of PWs 
at the place of occurrence in my site plan 
Ex.PR. I have not mentioned any point in the 
site plan Ex.PR where the PWs had slept on the 
night of occurrence. There was no cot lying 
near or adjacent to the cot of the deceased when 
I reached there. Volunteered, cots were lying 
here and there in the courtyard……I have 
shown only one standing point of accused at the 
time of occurrence in the site plan Ex.PR. None 
of the PWs showed me different standing point 
of the accused while firing.” 
 
 
 
Bilal Ahmad Bhatti Draftsman (PW-4) inspected the place of 
occurrence on 26.05.2018 and took rough notes on the pointing of the 
complainant and PWs. He (PW-4) deposed during cross-examination that: -  
“I have not shown the sleeping position of the 
PWs as well as the position of the accused in 
scaled site plan Exh.PB and Exh.PB/1.” 
 
 
Akhtar Ali (PW-10)-the complainant deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“My cot was about 1 ½ to 2 meters from the cot 
of Niaz deceased, then was of mine and then the 
cot of Zafar PW. At the time of occurrence 
Arshad accused was at a distance of 10/12 feet 
from me. Distance between the deceased and 

Murder Reference No.159 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.47011-J of 2019 
 
11
accused at the time of occurrence was about 3 
feet.” 
 
Zafar Ali (PW-11) deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“The accused was at a distance of 15/20 feet 
from us when he made fire. We were on left side 
of the deceased near our cots when the deceased 
was hit. The accused made firing at the 
deceased while touching the barrel at mosquito 
net. The accused remained at the place of 
occurrence for about one or one and half 
minute. The accused changed his positions 
during the occurrence. We told the I.O that the 
accused made fires in walking position during 
the occurrence.” 
 
 
Besides, Azhar Hussain S.I. (PW-8)-investigating officer, had 
shown the direction of the foot side of the cot in different directions. Azhar 
Hussain S.I. (PW-8)-investigating officer admitted during cross-examination 
that: -  
“The foot side of the cot of deceased has been 
shown towards east in the site plan Ex.PR. 
whereas in the inquest report Ex.PJ, I 
mentioned the foot side of the cot of the 
deceased on west side.” 
 
 
Even the distance between the accused and the deceased at the 
time of the firing was not mentioned in the un-scaled site plan (Ex. PR). 
Bilal Ahmad Bhatti Draftsman (PW-4) has left space blank in the scaled site 
plan (Exh. PB and Exh.PB/1). The scaled site plan (Exh. PB and Exh. PB/1) 
consists of six points, i.e., from point “A” to point “F.” Distance between the 
other points was mentioned except for the distance between point A to B. 
Point “B” reads as under:

Moreover, looking at the material contradictions and omissions, 
we are of the opinion that the prosecution has withheld the true genesis of 
the occurrence. In our opinion, the prosecution has failed to bring home the 
charges framed against the appellant. We find it unsafe to rely upon such 
witnesses' evidence to base the accused's conviction.  
14. 
 
Admittedly, Akhtar Ali (PW-10)-the complainant, and Zafar 
Ali (PW-11) are chance witnesses. The prosecution witnesses are not only 
related inter-se and also with the deceased. Akhtar Ali (PW-10)-the 
complainant alleged that the motive behind the occurrence was that Niaz 
Ali, deceased, used to quarrel with Hameeda Bibi, sister of the accused, and 
due to said grudge, the accused committed the murder. Akhtar Ali (PW-10)-
the complainant deposed during examination-in-chief that: - 
“4 months prior to the occurrence marriage of my 
nephew Safdar Ali was solemnized with Hameeda 
Bibi sister of accused Arshad at village Bukkan 
Kalan Hafizabad.  On 09.05.2018 Hameeda Bibi 
after quarrel came at village Bukan Kalan. On 
23.05.2018 I along with, my brother Niaz Ali and 
Zafar Ali came at Bukkan Kalan for reconciliation 
with Hameeda Bibi and talk to his brother Arshad 
Ali in this regard who refused to do so…….Motive 
behind the occurrence was that Niaz Ali deceased 
used to quarrel with Hameeda Bibi sister of accused 
and due to this grudge accused Arshad Ali 
committed this occurrence.” 
 
 
 
Zafar Ali (PW-11) also deposed in the same lines. As per 
prosecution witnesses Akhtar Ali (PW-10)-the complainant, Zafar Ali (PW-
11), on the refusal by Arshad Ali, the brother of Hameeda Bibi, to have a 
reconciliation, they stayed at the house of the accused. Zafar Ali (PW-11) 
deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“We talked till evening then we slept. The deceased 
used a new bedding with mosquito net on the night 
of occurrence.” 
 
 
It reveals that providing new bedding to the deceased is 
impossible if the reconciliation proceedings fail. Zafar Ali (PW-11) admitted 

Murder Reference No.159 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.47011-J of 2019 
 
13
that no grappling occurred between them and the accused on the night of the 
occurrence. Safdar Ali (PW-9), the husband of Hameeda Bibi, had not come 
forward and stated about his and Hameeda Bibi’s relationship. During cross-
examination, Safdar Ali (PW-9) deposed that: - 
“I married Mst. Hameeda Bibi sister of Arshad 
accused. My wife Mst. Hameeda Bib is not 
restituting with me now-a-days. It is not in my 
knowledge where she is residing now.” 
 
 
Nothing on record shows what prevented him (PW-9) from 
disclosing the motive part of the incident, which is directly linked to him. 
Therefore, we are inclined to believe that the prosecution failed to prove the 
motive part of the occurrence, which is shrouded in mystery.

So far as recovery of the weapon of offence, i.e., pistol 30-bore, 
from the possession of the accused/appellant and positive report of Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency (Firearms and took marks Examination report) 
(Ex. PT), are concerned, as per the prosecution case, five crime empties 
were collected from the place of occurrence by Azhar Hussain S.I (PW-8)-
the investigating officer were matched with the weapon recovered on the 
pointing of Arshad Ali (the appellant), resulting into a positive report of 
Punjab Forensic Science Agency (Ex. PT). On perusal of the record, it 
reveals that Azhar Hussain S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer deposed 
during examination-in-chief: - 
 “PFSA team inspected the place of occurrence, 
collected five crime empties, made the same into 
parcels separately and handed over to me. I took the 
same into possession through recovery memo Ex.PK 
which was attested by the PWs.”  
 
 
Contrary to the deposition of Azhar Hussain S.I. (PW-8)-the 
investigating officer, Akhtar Ali (PW-10)-the complainant deposed during 
examination-in-chief that:- 
 “I.O. collected five crime empties from the place of 
occurrence, prepared the parcel of crime empties 
and took the same into possession through recovery 

Murder Reference No.159 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.47011-J of 2019 
 
14
memo Ex.PK which was attested by me and Zafar 
Ali PW.”  
 
 
In similar lines, Zafar Ali (PW-11)-the eye witness deposed. 
Admittedly, the investigating officer did not collect crime empties; the PFSA 
team secured the same. After collecting the same, they prepared separate 
parcels and handed them to the investigating officer (PW-8), who secured 
them through a recovery memo (Ex. PK). Azhar Hussain S.I. (PW-8)-the 
investigating officer deposed during the examination-in-chief that he 
conducted proceedings at the place of occurrence. After that, he searched for 
the accused and reached DHQ Hospital Hafizabad. After the postmortem 
examination, Bashir Ahmad 391/C (PW-5) handed over to him the 
postmortem report, police papers, parcels prepared by the doctor, and the 
last worn clothes of the deceased. After that, he reached police station 
Vanike Tarar and handed over the case property to Moharrar. Admittedly, 
Azhar Hussain S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer, returned to the police 
station after conducting proceedings at the place of occurrence, a search of 
the accused, and visiting the hospital. The prosecution evidence remained 
silent that five parcels of crime empties remained during the said period in 
whose custody. The prosecution failed to establish by cogent evidence that 
the alleged parcels of crime empties seized from the place of occurrence 
were kept in safe custody. As per the prosecution case, Arshad Ali (the 
appellant) was arrested on 28.05.2018, and the weapon, i.e., pistol (P-5), was 
recovered on 30.05.2018 on his disclosure from his house. Per the 
prosecution case, the accused fled away from the place of occurrence after 
the occurrence. It was not the prosecution’s case that he went inside the 
house, kept the pistol, and fled away. Azhar Hussain S.I. (PW-8)-the 
investigating officer deposed during the examination in chief that after 
inspecting the place of occurrence, he searched for the accused. During 
cross-examination, he (PW-8)-the investigating officer, deposed that: - 
“I have mentioned no place in my proceedings, 
where I searched for the accused.----------- I have not 
shown arrest of Arshad accused from his house on 
28.05.2018. Volunteered, he was arrested from his

& Crl. Appeal No.47011-J of 2019 
 
15
house. I did not recover anything from the house of 
the accused on 28.05.2018.”  
 
 
As per the admission of Azhar Hussain, S.I. (PW-8)-the 
investigating officer, at the time of the arrest of the accused from his house 
on 28.05.2018, he did not recover anything. Strangely, the weapon, which 
could not be retrieved on 28.05.2018, was recovered on 30.05.2018 after 02-
days of his arrest from the accused’s house, although the accused had ample 
opportunity to destroy the weapon from 24.05.2018 to 28.05.2018. It does 
not appeal to the prudent mind that to facilitate the investigating agency, the 
accused will bring back the weapon, and he will conceal the same in his 
house, which the investigating officer could not recover at the time of his 
arrest. But later on, the same will be recovered on his pointing.  
16. 
 
Besides, a bare reading of Section 510 Cr.P.C., a report of an 
expert is per se admissible without examination of the expert. It would be 
appropriate to quote Section 510 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which 
reads as under: -  
“510. Report of Chemical Examiner, Serologist, etc. 
Any document purporting to be a report, under the hand 
of any Chemical Examiner or Assistant Chemical 
Examiner to Government [or of the Chief Chemist of 
Pakistan Security Printing Corporation, Limited] or any 
Serologist, finger print expert or fire-arm expert or the 
Chemist or the Pharmacist or the Forensic Scientist or 
Hand-writing expert appointed by Government upon 
any matter or thing duly submitted to him for 
examination or analysis and report in the course of any 
proceeding under this Code, may without calling him as 
a witness, be used as evidence in any inquiry, trial or 
other proceeding under this Code: Provided that the 
Court may [if it considers necessary in the interest of 
justice] summon and examine the person by whom such 
report has been made.].” 
 
 
A bare reading of this Section makes it abundantly clear that the 
reports of the Chemical Examiner or Assistant Chemical Examiner to the 
Government [or of the Chief Chemist of Pakistan Security Printing 
Corporation, Limited] or any Serologist, fingerprint expert, or fire-arm 
expert or the Chemist or the Pharmacist or the Forensic Scientist or Hand-

& Crl. Appeal No.47011-J of 2019 
 
16
writing expert are admissible per se without they being formally proved by 
the person who has made the same. It is in prosecution evidence that a team 
consisting of the members of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency inspected 
the place of occurrence, collected five crime empties, made the same into 
parcels separately, and handed them over to Azhar Hussain, S.I. (PW-8)-the 
investigating officer. The members of the PFSA team are not officers 
covered by Section 510 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and thus, the 
positive report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency (Ex. PT) is not 
conclusive and reliable in the absence of the officers above being examined 
in Court, who collected crime empties from the spot and prepared separate 
parcels to prove the fact that they collected crime empties from the place of 
occurrence and after that, they prepared parcels which were handed over to 
Azhar Hussain, S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer. The report in question 
is of no help to the prosecution as there is nothing on record to prove that the 
recovery of five crime empties alleged to have been made by the members of 
the PFSA team, were the same which were recovered from the place of 
occurrence. Azhar Hussain, S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer, admitted 
that he had not mentioned the name of any Forensic Team member nor 
obtained his signature on the recovery memo Ex.PK relating to empties. 
Azhar Hussain (PW-8)-the investigating officer admitted during cross-
examination that: - 
 “I have not mentioned the name of any Forensic 
Team member nor obtained his signature on the 
recovery memo Ex.PK relating to empties.”  
 
 
 
There can, thus be no dispute that it was incumbent upon the 
prosecution to produce members of the PFSA team who have collected the 
crime empties and prepared separate parcels in order to prove the chain of 
safe custody. Without such proof, report of PFSA cannot corroborate the 
case of prosecution. 
17. 
 
From the above-detailed discussion, we are convinced that the 
prosecution has failed to establish its case. The truth was seen buried under 
the debris, and a different story was structured perhaps to lug the appellant 

Murder Reference No.159 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.47011-J of 2019 
 
17
into trial under the serious offense.  It is often said “that Fouler the crime 
higher the decree of proof” we have gone through the process of keen 
examination of the entire material and found compelling reasons, as stated 
above, to disagree with the conclusion reached, recorded by the learned 
Additional Sessions Judge and also found that the prosecution has miserably 
failed to prove the guilt of the accused-appellant beyond a reasonable doubt. 
As per the dictates of law benefit of every doubt is to be extended in favor of 
the accused. In the case of “Muhammad Akram v. The State” (2009 SCMR 
230), it is held as under:- 
“The nutshell of the whole discussion is that the 
prosecution case is not free from doubt. It is an 
axiomatic principle of law that in case of doubt, the 
benefit thereof must accrue in favor of the accused 
as matter of right and not of grace. It was observed 
by this Court in the case of Tariq Pervez v. The 
State 1995 SCMR 1345 that for giving the benefit of 
doubt, it was not necessary that there should be 
many circumstances creating doubts. If there is 
circumstance which created reasonable doubt in a 
prudent mind about the guilt of the accused, then 
the accused would be entitled to the benefit of doubt 
not as a matter of grace and concession but as a 
matter of right.” 
 
 
The golden principle of law is that the Court should let off a 
hundred guilty but not convict one innocent person. In the case of “Ayub 
Masih  v.  The State”  (PLD 2002 SC 1048), it has been held by the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan that:- 
“----It is hardly necessary to reiterate that the 
prosecution is obliged to prove its case against the 
accused beyond any reasonable doubt and if it fails to 
do so the accused is entitled to the benefit of doubt as of 
right. It is also firmly settled that if there is an element 
of doubt as to the guilt of the accused the benefit of that 
doubt must be extended to him. The doubt of course 
must be reasonable and not imaginary or artificial. The 
rule of benefit of doubt, which is described as the 
golden rule, is essentially a rule of prudence which can 
not be ignored while dispensing justice in accordance 
with law. It is based on the maxim, “it is better that ten 

Murder Reference No.159 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.47011-J of 2019 
 
18
guilty persons be acquitted rather than one innocent 
person be convicted”. 
 In simple words it means that utmost care should be 
taken by the Court in convicting an accused. It has 
further been held in “The State  v.  Mushtaq Ahmed” 
(PLD 1973 SC 418) that this rule is antithesis of 
haphazard approach or reaching a fitful decision in a 
case. It will not be out of place to mention here that this 
rule occupies a pivotal place in the Islamic law and is 
enforced rigorously in view of the saying of the Holy 
Prophet (P.B.U.H) that the “mistake of Qazi (Judge) in 
releasing a criminal is better than his mistake in 
punishing an innocent”.  
 
18. 
 
The upshot of the above discussion is that the prosecution had 
severely failed to bring home charge against the appellant beyond any 
reasonable doubt; therefore, in the interest of the safe administration of 
Criminal Justice, Criminal Appeal No.47011 of 2019 is accepted. The 
sentence awarded by the learned Additional Sessions Judge (MCTC), 
Hafizabad, vide judgment dated 21.05.2019, is set aside, and the appellant is 
acquitted of the charge in case F.I.R. No.174 of 2018, dated 24.05.2018, an 
offence under section 302  P.P.C. registered at Police Station  Vanike Tarar, 
District Hafizabad. The appellant-Arshad Ali son of Ahmad Ali is ordered to 
be released forthwith, if not required in any other case. Murder Reference 
No.159 of 2019 is answered in the negative, and the death sentence awarded 
to Arshad Ali, son of Ahmad Ali (convict), is Not Confirmed.
