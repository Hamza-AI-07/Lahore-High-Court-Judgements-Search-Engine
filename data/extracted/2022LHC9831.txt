3. 
After completion of investigation, report under Section 173 of 
the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 was submitted. The learned 
trial court, after observing pre-trial codal formalities, framed the 
charge against the appellant on 19.02.2018 to which he pleaded not 
guilty and claimed trial.  
4. 
The prosecution, in order to prove its case, produced as many 
as six witnesses during the trial. Saleem Ahmad Malik, Inspector 
Customs (PW-1), on receipt of complaint (Exh-PA/1), drafted formal 
FIR (Exh-PA). Mazhar ul Haq, Inspector Customs (PW-2) is the 
complainant. Ch. Bashir Ahmad, Inspector Customs (PW-3) is the 
recovery witness. Muhammad Yousaf Khan (PW-4) is the Incharge 
of Customs State Warehouse, Lahore. Riaz Ali Shah, Inspector 
Customs (PW-5) and Syed Muhammad Ali, Inspector Customs (PW-
6) are the Investigation Officers. Learned Special Prosecutor for 
Customs gave up Arshad Dub, Sepoy Customs being unnecessary 
and closed the prosecution evidence. 
5. 
After completion of prosecution evidence, statement of the 
appellant under Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
1898 was recorded wherein, he refuted the allegations levelled 
against him and asserted his innocence. He further deposed that 
when he approached the Customs counter, his entire luggage 
including hand pouch was scanned and during his body scan, he 
informed Mazhar ul Haq (PW-2) that he had US $ 39100 with him. 
He also produced two receipts, one issued by M/S United Exchange 
Company based in Hong Kong according to which he got exchanged 
54600 Australian Dollars into 310,128 Hong Kong Dollars and the 
second was issued by United Exchange Forex Company, Hong Kong 
whereby, he got exchanged Hong Kong Dollars into US $ 39,900 
which he was allowed to take out of Pakistan but he was arrested and 
this false case was got registered against him. He did not opt to 
appear as his own witness as provided under Section 340(2) of the 
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 in disproof of the allegation 

Crl. Appeal No.15248 of 2020

levelled against him however, he did produce certain documents in 
his defence. 
6. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
7. 
Per prosecution‟s case, the foreign currency was recovered at 
the last scanning and body search counter and the appellant was 
brought to Mazhar ul Haq, Inspector Customs (PW-2) by one 
Muhammad Arif, Inspector ASF meaning thereby, the appellant had 
already passed through Customs checking counter without declaring 
his possession of subject currency and ANF checking counter but the 
prosecution remained fail to prove that he had passed through the 
said counters. No immigration stamp of exit from Pakistan on the 
passport of the appellant could be got proved in evidence. The 
prosecution was expected to establish the alleged fact and that could 
be done by producing CCTV footage of relevant lounge and counters 
as the appellant has taken the stance that he went to the concerned 
counter and declared his possession, with correct or incorrect legal 
justification. If it was so, the proper course for the Customs 
Department was that the appellant should have been provided an 
opportunity to leave the currency here in Pakistan with any of his 
relatives if he had to travel on the flight on that day otherwise, he 
could transfer the money in accordance with law to his destination. 
Moreover, abovementioned Muhammad Arif, Inspector ASF was 
never joined with the investigation or produced by the prosecution 
during the trial. To highlight the relevance of this witness, relevant 
excerpts from the statement of Mazhar ul Haq, Inspector Customs 
(PW-2) are reproduced as under: - 
“…As soon as the passenger arrived in the International 
Departure Hall, he passes through the customs declaration 
counter. It is correct that the luggage of the outgoing 
passenger passes through the scanning machine. It is correct 
that everything which is contained in the luggage of passenger 
is shown in the scanning machine. It is correct that all the 
outgoing passengers were going through the customs 
declaration counter and their luggage was being scanned from 
the scanning machine installed at the customs counter. Yes, I

was present at the customs counter. Volunteers that since 10 
PM, I was present there. Ch. Bashir Ahmad, inspector customs 
Abdul Shakoor Superintendent and Arshad Dub sepoy were 
present alongwith me at the customs counter...Presently I do 
not recognize the features of the accused Afzal Nazir and I 
cannot tell whether he passes through the customs counter in 
my presence. 
I do not know whether the accused Afzal Nazir passes through 
the customs counter on the said date. I did not search the 
accused Afzal Nazir at customs counter on 14-12-2018. No 
recovery was effected from accused Afzal Nazir at customs 
counter. In my presence, US $ 39100 was not recovered from 
the accused Afzal Nazir. I neither prepared the list Ex. PB 
containing serial wise detail of the seized currency / US $ nor 
it was prepared in my presence…I mentioned in my complaint 
Ex. P.A/1 that Muhammad Arif inspector ASF came to me 
and informed me (Confronted with Ex. DA/Ex.PA/1) where it 
is not mentioned to who the information was given by the said 
inspector Muhammad Arif). I did not mentioned in complaint 
Ex. P.A/1 regarding receiving of US $ from Muhammad Arif, 
inspector ASF and delivering him a written receipt thereof. It 
is correct that I did not mention in complaint Ex.P.A/1 
regarding the list prepared by the ASF carrying detail / serial 
number of US $. It is correct that the said list was not prepared 
in my presence. It is correct that I did not mention the 
complaint Ex. P.A/1 qua handing over of the aforementioned 
list containing detail of serial number…”(underlining is for 
emphasis) 
These parts of statement of PW-2 in very clear terms reveal that 
Muhammad Arif, Inspector, Airport Security Force is the most 
relevant and necessary witness with regard to the alleged recovery of 
subject foreign currency and also to prove the spot where the same 
was allegedly recovered. Moreover, being scribe of the list (Exh-
PB), he was the person who could get it proved in evidence. So, 
withholding most material witness who, in the circumstances, is not 
at all unnecessary requires that an adverse inference under Article 
129(g) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 be drawn against the 
credibility of prosecution case. Reliance in this respect is placed on 
the esteemed judgments passed by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the cases of Lal Khan v. The State (2006 SCMR 1846) 
and Muhammad Rafique and others v. The State and others       
(2010 SCMR 385). In the case of Muhammad Rafique and others, 

Crl. Appeal No.15248 of 2020

supra, the Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased to 
observe as under: - 
“33. …It is well-settled that if any party withholds the best 
piece of evidence then it can fairly be presumed that the party 
had some sinister motive behind it. The presumption under 
Article 129(g) of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order can fairly be drawn 
that if P.W. Amir Ali could have been examined, his evidence 
would have been unfavourable to the prosecution…” 
The prosecution also could not produce Air Ticket or the luggage tag 
to prove the allegation that the appellant had passed the Customs 
counter without declaring his possession of US$ 39100. Reading of 
recovery memo (Exh-PD) pertaining to the items taken into 
possession on personal search of the appellant also evinces that no 
luggage tag, boarding card or ticket was taken by Airport Security 
Force or the Customs authorities i.e. PW-2 from the appellant. This 
rather further strengthens the stance of the appellant to the effect that 
he never crossed the Customs counter without declaring the currency 
in his possession. Because of non-availability of Air Ticket, 
Boarding Card, Exit stamp as well as the luggage tag in prosecution 
evidence, in view of this Court, the prosecution remained unable to 
prove the alleged fact that the appellant on that day was destined to 
take flight from Allama Iqbal International Airport to Bangkok. Even 
travel history of the appellant could not be brought on record. 
8. 
Another important aspect of this case noticed by this Court is 
that Riaz Ali Shah, Inspector Customs (PW-5), the investigation 
officer of case in hand, during his cross examination, concedes that 
during investigation, he came to know that the appellant is an 
Australian Nationality holder and he was given Australian 
Nationality in the year 2006 which was valid till the registration of 
this case. By denying the presentation of receipt issued by Pacific 
Exchange Company at Hong Kong whereby on 20.11.2018, 
Australian Dollars 54600 were converted into 310,128 Hong Kong 
Dollars, he however, concedes that during investigation, the 
appellant informed him that he got converted 54600 Australian 
Dollars into 310,128 Hong Kong Dollars and later on, he converted 

Crl. Appeal No.15248 of 2020 
6
310128 Hong Kong Dollars into 39900 US Dollars from United 
Exchange Foreign Company. He further admits that the appellant 
arrived in Pakistan from Hong Kong at Allama Iqbal International 
Airport on 01.12.2018 and that he was going back to Australia en-
route Hong Kong. During cross examination, on 11.11.2019, the said 
witness, the investigation officer also admits that on 30.01.2019, the 
appellant moved an application before the learned trial court for 
return of his personal belonging and that in the said application, at 
Sr. No.I & J, the appellant requested for return of receipts of 
conversion of Australian Dollars 54600 into Hong Kong Dollars 
issued by money changer based in Hong Kong and return of receipt 
of conversion of Hong Kong Dollars into US $39,800. He also 
admits that the learned trial court directed to return the personal 
belonging of the appellant vide order dated 01.02.2019. To establish 
the fact of valid possession of subject foreign currency with the 
appellant, in the light of Clause (e) of SRO No.1017(I)/98 dated 
21.07.1998 (Mark-A), the appellant produced printout of E-mail 
dated 26.03.2019 sent by Pacific Exchange Company Ltd, Hong 
Kong along with attachment of the Forex Receipt dated 20.11.2018 
issued in the name of the appellant (Exh-D-1), original East Bank 
Statement evincing Banking Transaction of personal account of the 
appellant (Exh-D-2), electronic printout of E-mail forwarded by the 
appellant to Mr. Nadeem Noor, representative of United Exchange 
based in Hong Kong (Exh-D-3). Perusal of paragraph No.21 of the 
impugned judgment reveals that the learned Judge has erroneously 
read Clauses „d‟ & „f‟ of the said Notification with Clause „e‟ while 
Clause „e‟ is an independent Clause that speaks about the persons not 
ordinarily residing in Pakistan like the appellant. Similarly, the 
learned court has also misunderstood the case law reported as 2006 
SCMR 1609, facts of which are distinguishable from the 
circumstances of the case in hand. Money in this case was not got 
exchanged from Pakistan. It was carried in and was being carried out 
by the appellant within a few days and the money exchange 
company was based in Hong Kong which is evident from the 

Crl. Appeal No.15248 of 2020 
7
documents produced as Exh.D-1, Exh-D-2 and Exh-D-3. In this view 
of the matter, if the appellant was carrying the foreign currency 
brought by him, subject matter of this case on his way back to his 
ordinary place of residence, out of Pakistan then, in the light of 
abovementioned SRO available on file as Mark-A, possession of the 
same with the appellant cannot be considered illegal.     
Taking stock of the above facts collectively, this Court is 
convinced to hold that the prosecution remained fail to prove its case 
against the appellant beyond the shadow of a reasonable doubt. 
There remains no cavil about the proposition that if there is a single 
circumstance which creates reasonable doubt regarding the 
credibility of prosecution case, the same is sufficient to give benefit 
of the same to the accused.  
9. 
In the light of above discussion, Criminal Appeal No.15248 
of 2020 is allowed, conviction and sentence awarded to Afzal Nazir, 
appellant by the learned trial court is set aside and he is acquitted of 
the charge levelled against him by extending him the benefit of 
doubt. He is on bail, his bail bonds are discharged and sureties are 
released. The articles taken into possession by the Customs 
authorities, available with the prosecution, Passport and the subject 
foreign currency US $ 39100 be given to the appellant against a valid 
receipt. To the extent of articles already given to the appellant, the 
surety, if any, is discharged.

In view final adjudication of main appeal, there is no need to 
proceed with these applications, the same are disposed of.
