Anwaar Hussain, J:-  Through the present petition, under 
Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973, challenge has been laid to the judgment dated 01.12.2022, passed 
by learned Additional District Judge, Ferozwala by virtue of which the 
order dated 26.10.2022 passed by learned Rent Tribunal, Ferozwala, 
has been set aside and the application of respondent No.2, under Order 
I Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (“the CPC”) for 
impleadment as a respondent, in the eviction petition filed by the 
petitioners, has been accepted.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the appeal, 
preferred by respondent No.2, against order dated 26.10.2022, was not 
competent in terms of Section 28 of the Punjab Rented Premises Act, 
2009 („the Act‟) inasmuch as the said order was interlocutory in nature 
and no appeal can be preferred against an interim order passed in the 
eviction proceedings. Conversely, learned counsel for respondent No.2 

W.P. No.81565/2022  
 
2
submits that the petitioners are nephews of respondent No.2 and the 
rented premises is part of the joint property, which the predecessor-in-
interest of the petitioners and respondent No.2 inherited and respondent 
No.1 was admittedly inducted as tenant by respondent No.2, therefore, 
respondent No.2 was necessary and proper party. Adds that the order of 
the learned Rent Tribunal dated 26.10.2022 dismissing the application 
of respondent No.2, by all means, was a final order determining the 
rights of said respondent and, hence, appeal was maintainable in terms 
of Section 28 of the Act. Learned counsel for respondent No.1 has 
adopted the arguments of learned counsel for respondent No.2 and 
averred that respondent No.1 has handed over the vacant possession of 
the rented premises to respondent No.2.  
3. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
4. 
The legal issue involved in the petition is to opine whether order 
dated 26.10.2022, dismissing the application filed by respondent No.2 
under Order I Rule 10 of the CPC, passed by the learned Rent Tribunal 
was final order under the Act and the appeal was maintainable or not 
before the learned Appellate Court below. 
5. 
Section 2(b) of the Act provides definition of the term „final 
order‟ whereas Section 28 confers the right of appeal on the aggrieved 
party against the final order only. Section 2(b) reads as under: 
“2.   Definitions.– In this Act: 
       
 
(a)  …….; 
(b) “final order” means a final order passed by a Rent 
Tribunal culminating the proceedings including an order in 
respect of adjustment of pagri, advance rent, security, 
arrears of rent, compensation or costs but shall not include 
an order passed in an execution proceeding;” 
  
 
 
                    (Emphasis supplied) 
Whereas Section 28 of the Act reads as under: 
“28. Appeal.– (1) A person aggrieved by a final order may, 
within thirty days, prefer an appeal in writing to the District 
Judge of the district. 

W.P. No.81565/2022  
 
3
(2)  No appeal shall lie against an interlocutory order 
passed by a Rent Tribunal.” 
  
 
 
 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
The learned Appellate Court below while examining the interplay of 
both the above-quoted provisions, relied upon case reported as “Tariq 
Siddique v. Additional Rent Controller and others (2018 YLR 313) and 
held that when application under Order I Rule 10 of the CPC, filed by 
respondent No.2, was dismissed by the learned Rent Tribunal, the 
proceedings to the extent of respondent No.2 have been culminated, 
therefore, the order of dismissal of said application was final, hence, 
the appeal was competent under the law. Learned counsel for the 
petitioners laid a lot of emphasis on the point that the learned Appellate 
Court below has erred in placing reliance on case of Tariq Siddique 
supra as the judgment thereof was rendered by this Court in exercise of 
its constitutional jurisdiction which in itself implies that appeal is not 
available against the order of the Rent Tribunal where an application 
under Order I Rule 10 of the CPC is decided, and hence, recourse to 
constitutional jurisdiction of this Court is the appropriate remedy and 
the learned Appellate Court below has misconstrued the said judgment 
of this Court, by entertaining the appeal under Section 28 of the Act. 
He argued that in fact in case reported as Tariq Siddique supra, it has 
been clearly held that the order dismissing an application under I Rule 
10 of the CPC is an interlocutory order. The argument of learned 
counsel for the petitioners is misconceived inasmuch as in case of Tariq 
Siddique supra, primarily the constitutional petition was allowed by 
setting aside the order of the Rent Tribunal on the ground that the 
application under Order I Rule 10 of the CPC had been allowed on the 
basis of an agreement to sell and such an agreement does not confer 
any title. No appeal in that case had been filed and the constitutional 
jurisdiction was invoked. Moreover, the question whether order 
dismissing application under Order I Rule 10 of the CPC is a „final 
order‟ for the purposes of Section 28 of the Act or not did not come 
directly under adjudication in case of Tariq Siddique supra as the 

W.P. No.81565/2022  
 
4
aggrieved party therein did not approach the learned Appellate Court 
below in the said case. The exercise of constitutional jurisdiction in the 
said case has not been objected to by learned counsel for the 
petitioners, however, he asserts that the recourse to the appellate 
jurisdiction was not appropriate course of action as the order dismissing 
application under Order I Rule 10 of the CPC was not „final order‟ as 
defined under the Act. Therefore, it is imperative to examine the 
meaning and scope of the term „final order‟ as contemplated under the 
Act. 
6. 
The legislature has used the words „means‟ as well as „including‟ 
while defining the term „final order‟ under Section 2(b). The first part 
defining the term „final order‟ uses the words „means‟ followed by the 
expression „culminating the proceedings‟ whereas the second part uses 
the word „including‟. The first part provides the principle and test to 
determine what is „final order‟ and perusal of the definition indicates 
that any order which culminates and concludes the proceedings is a 
„final order‟. The second part lists down some of the matters  
such as adjustment of pagri, advance rent, security, arrears of rent, 
compensation or costs which when dealt with by the learned Rent 
Tribunal also are in the nature of the final order(s) or part thereof. No 
doubt that it is accepted canon of interpretation that in the definition or 
interpretation clause in a Statute, the word „means‟ is employed to 
restrict the meaning whereas the word „includes‟ is used to widen the 
meanings of the term so defined. A bare perusal of the definition „final 
order‟ under Section 2(b) indicates that the legislature intended to 
widen the scope of the term „final order‟ by use of the word „including‟ 
so as to ensure that the learned Tribunal while deciding the ejectment 
petition also adjudicate the issues, if any, related to pagri, advance rent, 
security, arrears of rent, compensation or costs so that the ejectment 
proceedings under the Act, when culminate, clearly settle these issues 
between a landlord and a tenant. Here it is imperative to analyse the 
meaning of the term „culminating the proceedings‟ used in Section 2(b) 
of the Act. According to “Webster’s Encyclopaedic Unabridged 

W.P. No.81565/2022  
 
5
Dictionary of the English Language”, the term „culminate‟ means to 
„terminate at the highest point meaning thereby to have result or be the 
final result of a process‟. The term „proceeding‟ has not been 
explicitly defined under the Act. It is a noun and often pluralized 
as proceedings and is used in legal parlance to show that something is 
happening, or moving forward referring to all methods of invoking the 
jurisdiction of a Court/Tribunal, and as per “P Ramanatha Aiyar’s, 
Advanced Law Lexicon-The Encyclopaedic Law Dictionary, 4th 
Edition, Volume 3”, the term „proceedings‟ includes any suit, appeal, 
or application and in general acceptation, a proceeding is an act which 
is done by the authority or direction of the Court, express or implied, 
and act necessary to be done in order to attain a given end. It may be 
used and it is often used to express the specific steps taken in the course 
of suit or appeal. The term proceeding(s) has been also used in Section 
24 of the CPC and defined in a non-exhaustive manner to include not 
only the suit but the execution proceedings as well so as to include 
within its ambit all matters coming up for adjudication. 
7. 
Having analyzed the words „culminating the proceedings‟, it is 
pertinent to observe that when an ejectment petitioner (in the instant 
case, the petitioners) files an eviction petition against another 
person/tenant (in the instant case, respondent No.1), proceedings are 
initiated between them under the Act, however, within these main 
(ejectment) proceedings, when a third person (in the instant case 
respondent No.2) approaches the Rent Tribunal with an application 
under Order I Rule 10 of the CPC, another set of proceedings 
commence as between the said applicant and the ejectment petitioner as 
well as the tenant inasmuch as the term „proceedings‟ is a general word 
and, as analysed hereinabove, not limited to the proceedings in the 
main ejectment petition but to include within its ambit all matters 
coming up for adjudication. Therefore, the term „final order 
culminating proceedings‟, under Section 2(b) of the Act viz. the 
ejectment petitioner and the applicant of the application under Order I 
Rule 10 of the CPC, means the order by virtue of which the said 

W.P. No.81565/2022  
 
6
application is decided, thus, culminating the proceedings initiated by an 
applicant to become a party by filing an application under Order I Rule 
10 of the CPC as for all practical purposes, climax or point of highest 
development in such proceedings comes when such application is 
dismissed and the applicant is not allowed to be part of the main 
proceedings before the learned Rent Tribunal. Case reported as 
“Muhammad Mobin Siddiqui v. Mst. Shahzadi Begum and 2 others” 
(1982 SCMR 233) can be referred wherein, the landlady, who was the 
respondent before the Supreme Court of Pakistan, filed an ejectment 
petition against one Muhammad Abdul Alam Khan and the petitioner 
before the Supreme Court, namely, Muhammad Mobin Siddiqui, filed 
an application under Order I Rule 10 of the CPC to become party as a 
tenant that was allowed. However, the landlady denied having inducted 
the said Muhammad Mobin Siddiqui as tenant, and hence, issue to the 
extent of existence of relationship of landlord and tenant was decided 
against Muhammad Mobin Siddiqui but no appeal was preferred 
against the same whereas the matter proceeded against Muhammad 
Abdul Alam Khan who never contested the case and eviction order was 
passed. When Muhammad Mobin Siddiqui preferred an appeal against 
the eviction order that was dismissed by the Additional District Judge 
concerned and the constitutional petition against the findings also met 
with the same fate, the Supreme Court of Pakistan in this factual 
backdrop, held as under:  
“6. The learned counsel strenuously urged on behalf of 
Mobin Siddiqui, petitioner, that he was in fact the tenant of 
Mst. Shahzadi Begum with respect to the shop in question. 
He, however, admitted that he had not filed an appeal 
against the order of the Rent Controller dated 31-5-1978 
holding that he was not her tenant. He explained that the 
petitioner did not file an appeal against it since it was 
interlocutory order, and waited till the final decision of the 
ejectment application by the learned Rent Controller which 
was given vide his order dated 19-9-1978.    
7. This argument has no force because after the decision of 
the preliminary issue holding that Mobin Siddiqui was not 
a tenant under Mst. Shahzadi Begum, he was no longer a 
party to the case. If he, at all, wished to contest the matter 

W.P. No.81565/2022  
 
7
further, he should have filed an appeal against the 
aforementioned order of the Rent Controller dated 31-5-
1978 because as far as he was concerned that was the final 
order in this case. Not having done so he was not entitled 
now to file an appeal against the order of the ejectment 
before the Additional District Judge and the High Court, 
as he was not a party to the case in which that order was 
passed.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
Dealing with somewhat similar situation where the application under 
Order I Rule 10 of the CPC was dismissed by the learned Rent 
Controller, in case reported as “Syed Sarfaraz Ali v. Shahjehan Begum 
and another” (1996 CLC 1034), Sindh High Court while placing 
reliance on the ratio laid down in case of Muhammad Mobin Siddiqui 
supra, held as under:  
“10. In respect of the first issue there appears to be little 
doubt after the decision of the Supreme Court in 
Muhammad Mobin Siddiqui v. Mst. Shahzadi Begum and 2 
others, (1982 SCMR 233) that an order passed by a Rent 
Controller rejecting an application for impleadment under 
Order I, Rule 10 of the C.P.C is appealable, inasmuch as 
that, the same order amount to a final order and cannot be 
termed as interlocutory. This decision of the Supreme 
Court is well-reasoned since such an order amounts to a 
final adjudication as regards the intervenor as to whether 
he is or is not entitled to participate in proceedings” 
                                                                  (Emphasis supplied) 
8. 
Keeping in view the above referred analysis, this Court is of the 
opinion that had the impugned order been passed on the application of 
respondent No.1 or the petitioners and then such an application had 
been dismissed, it would have left a room for the petitioners and 
respondent No.1 to have an opportunity to wait for the final outcome of 
the eviction proceedings and then prefer an appeal whereas in instant 
case application under Order I Rule 10 of the CPC had been filed by a 
third party (respondent No.2), who, on the basis of certain material 
facts/documents, seeks permission of becoming party, in the ejectment 
petition. If such third party is non-suited and his application is 
dismissed, proceedings against him have certainly been culminated 

W.P. No.81565/2022  
 
8
before the learned Rent Tribunal. Denial to such intervener to be 
impleaded as party would either prejudice his right or open up 
multiplicity of litigation once the eviction petition is ultimately 
decided, which would bring about either abuse of process of law or 
cause injustice. Therefore, this Court is of the opinion that order 
dismissing the application of third parties under Order I, Rule 10 of the 
CPC, is a final order in terms of Section 2(b) of the Act and the appeal 
of respondent No.2 was maintainable in terms of Section 28 of the Act 
and the impugned order passed by the learned Appellate Court below 
does not suffer from any infirmity or jurisdictional error.  
9. 
Having held that the appeal of respondent No.2 was competent, it 
will be in fitness of things to examine whether the application of the 
said respondent under Order I Rule 10, of the CPC had merit. The 
learned Appellate Court below has examined the controversy and has 
put forth convincing reasons. Operative part of the impugned order is 
reproduced hereunder: 
 “7.....his impleadment in the ejectment petition prima-
facie seems necessary as the initial lease deed on the 
basis of which the respondents No.1 & 2/ejectment 
petitioners want to eject the respondent No.3 Major 
Masood Saeed Khan and appellant Aman Ullah was 
executed and registered 'between the appellant Aman 
Ullah and respondent No.3 Major Masood Saeed Khan, 
hence his impleadment is necessary to meet the fate of 
ejectment petition because once the respondent No.3 is 
being treated as the tenant of respondents No.1 & 2 on the 
basis of lease deed dated 17.03.2007, albeit, stood 
cancelled by the learned Civil Court through this 
judgment and decree dated 24.07.2015, then why the 
present appellant who was shown to have been the 
landlord in that lease deed can (sic) be treated as party to 
the present ejectment petition, in which the present 
respondents No.1 & 2 want to step in as the ejectment 
petitioners. Besides this, there is nothing on record from 
which it could be inferred that there exists any legal 
partition amongst all the co-owners of the property.”  
      (Emphasis supplied) 
This Court finds that it would be unjustified to refuse respondent No.2 
to be impleaded as party, as the lease deed with respect to the rented 

W.P. No.81565/2022  
 
9
premises, on the strength of which the ejectment petition was filed by 
the petitioners, was actually executed by him and respondent 
No.1/tenant and admittedly, the possession is with respondent No.2.  
10. 
In view of the above discussion, this Court is of the opinion that 
the learned Appellate Court below has correctly appreciated the legal 
and factual aspects of the matter. Learned counsel for the petitioners 
could not point out any mis-appreciation of record, jurisdictional defect 
or procedural impropriety in the findings of the learned Appellate Court 
below, hence, this petition is dismissed. No order as to costs.
