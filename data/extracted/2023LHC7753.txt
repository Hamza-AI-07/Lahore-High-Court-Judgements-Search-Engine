likely to be vacant till 30.01.2023 throughout the Province of

It is further stated in the comments that as per order of respondent No.1 the 
petitioner has fully enjoyed by excavating sand stone from the said leased 
area under Rule 228 of the Punjab Mining Concession Rules, 2002. Now, 
the leases of minor mineral (Sand Stone & Ordinary Sand), which are 
vacant or likely to be vacant upto 15.12.2023, have been advertised for open 
auction against the fixed reserve prices of each block/ zone in newspaper 
through "Daily Express" dated 20.08.2023 under Rule 198 of the Punjab 
Mining Concession Rules, 2002. As per said advertisement, open auction of 
leases of minor minerals of District Sargodha, including the Block in 
question was scheduled to be held on 11.09.2023, 02.10.2023 and 
01.11.2023 respectively.

4. 
Learned Assistant Advocate General, Punjab contends that to 
sabotage the legitimate auction process, the petitioner has filed the instant 
petition with mala-fide intention. The instant case revolves around the 
fixation of reserve price of the Block in question to the tune of 
Rs.40,00,00,000/-, vide decision of Special Experts Committee taken in its 
meeting dated 02.11.2022. The Special Experts Committee has determined 
the reserve price of the Block in question keeping in view the different 
factors, especially the market trend. The petitioner, in connivance with other 
existing lease holders, just wants to maintain regional monopoly over the 
business of sand stone that is why he has involved the Mines Department in 
an uncalled for litigation. His action point to his wish that the general public 
do not participate in the auction proceedings and offer bids for the Blocks of 
the sand stone, which is against the fundamental right of other citizens as 
envisaged in Article 18 of the Constitution of Pakistan. 
 
5. 
In rebuttal, learned counsel for the petitioner contends that despite 
several times, auction of Block No.116-A subject matter of this petition 
could not be carried out successfully on account of exorbitant reserve price. 
According to him, if an auction fails for such number of times, the matter is 
to be sent back to the Special Experts Committee for review of the reserve 
price. 
6. 
Fixation of reserve price is prerogative of the concerned government 
department and in this regard, neither any existing lessee nor any 
prospective bidder can seek fixation of the reserve price of his own choice. 
There is no cavil to the proposition that while fixing reserve price, the 
exercise of discretion by the public authority must be just, fair and 
reasonable and any arbitrary, whimsical and capricious exercise of such 
authority is amenable to judicial scrutiny, however, the scope of jurisdiction 
under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
in that regard is very limited. For such a challenge to succeed in writ 
jurisdiction, it is imperative for the petitioner to establish that the reserve 
price fixed by the public functionaries is so unreasonable that no authority 

4 
Writ Petition No.55800 of 2023 
 
 
with prudent mind could have fixed the same. This is also known as the 
wednesbury principle. Reliance in this regard has been placed on the cases 
of Messrs 3N-Lifemed Pharmaceuticals Vs. Government of Punjab through 
Secretary Primary and Secondary Healthcare Department and others  
(2023 CLC 948) and Hajj Organizers Association of Pakistan through 
Authorised Officer and 11 others Vs. Federation of Pakistan through 
Secretary Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony, Islamabad 
and 2 others  (PLD 2020 Sindh 42)  
7. 
In the instant case, as emphasized by the respondents in their 
parawise comments, the reserve price of Rs.40,00,00,000/- for Block 
No.116-A has been prescribed by the Special Experts Committee in the 
public interest keeping in view the market forces/trend, such as the fixed 
reserved prices of the surrounding blocks and corresponding bids received 
therein, a chart whereof has been reproduced in Paragraph No.3 herein 
above. The above explanation provides sufficient justification for the 
exercise of restraint in the matter and no case of arbitrary or unreasonable 
exercise of authority warranting interference has been established by the 
petitioner. Needless to observe that case auction for the Block in question 
fails to fetch bids for and above the reserve price advertised, as per 
directive/instruction dated 26.05.2021, the matter shall be referred to the 
Committee of Special Experts for review of the reserve price. 
8. 
This writ petition is disposed of accordingly.
