Anwaar Hussain, J. This Regular Second Appeal, under 
Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (“CPC”), is 
directed against impugned judgment and decree dated 02.11.2020, by 
virtue of which the appeal preferred by the respondents was accepted 
and judgment and decree dated 28.02.2019 passed by the Trial Court, 
whereby suit of the appellant for specific performance of agreement to 
sell dated 04.07.2008 (“the agreement”) was decreed, has been 
upended.  
2. 
By way of factual background, it has been noted that the 
appellant instituted a suit for specific performance of the contract 
based on the agreement, which was contested by the respondents with 
averments that the agreement is forged; that the predecessor of 
respondents No.1(a) and 1(b) (“the respondents”) was not owner of 
the suit property when it was purportedly sold in the year 2008 and 
only obtained ownership of the same through an exchange, in the year 
2010 albeit to the extent of 10-Marla, with respondent No.2. After

recording of evidence, the suit was decreed and when appeal was 
jointly preferred by the respondents as also respondent No.2, the 
former findings were upset.    
3. 
Learned counsel for the appellant submits that findings of the 
Courts below are at variance and well-reasoned judgment of the 
Trial Court has been upended by the Appellate Court below, without 
appreciating the factual matrix and evidentiary resume of the case. 
Adds that in order to prove the agreement, the appellant produced its 
marginal witnesses, notary public, as well as scribe of the agreement 
and the appellant herself also appeared, which testimony has been 
ignored for extraneous grounds that are alien to the applicable law 
inasmuch as the appeal of the respondents has been accepted while 
dismissing the suit of the appellant on the ground that there is no 
stipulation in the agreement that the respondents will execute the 
registered sale deed in favour of the appellant. Further submits that 
the possession of the appellant over the suit property was 
acknowledged, which gives further traction to the fact that the 
agreement was executed and complete sale price was received by the 
predecessor of the respondents.    
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondents has 
supported the impugned judgment. He states that Abdul Qayyum 
Baig (deceased), the purported vendor, completely denied the 
execution of the agreement since he was not owner of the suit 
property in the year 2008 when the agreement was executed, and 
became owner in the year 2010 by effecting exchange mutation, to 
the extent of 10-Marla only, with respondent No.2. Further 
contends that the evidence of the scribe as also the notary public 
was rightly disbelieved by the Appellate Court below as name       
of the former was not reflected in the agreement, as scribe, whereas 
the notary public did not produce the relevant register. He further 
contends that the stamp paper used for agreement was issued 
  

 
 
RSA. No.694/2021 
3 
 
 
 
in favour of husband of the appellant i.e., Muhammad Ghaus Baig, 
who did not appear as witness in support of the claim of the appellant 
and hence, adverse inference needs to be drawn. Further contends that 
the stamp vendor was also not produced, which is fatal to the case of 
the appellant as held in case reported as “Syed Abdur Rashid 
(deceased) through legal heirs v Rana Muhammad Anwer” (2023 
YLR 309 Lahore). Concludes that exact description of the suit 
property is not given in the agreement, hence, the impugned decree 
could not be passed.   
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
6. 
The substantial question of law requiring opinion of this Court 
was formulated, vide order dated 09.05.2023, which reads as under: 
“Whether a decree can be passed in a suit for specific 
performance of contract, based on a written agreement to 
sell that does not contain a stipulation regarding 
registration of a sale deed in respect of the immovable 
property forming subject matter of the sale?” 
 
7. 
Before proceeding further, it will be appropriate to reproduce 
the issues framed by the Trial Court and also analyze the evidentiary 
resume of the case. Following issues were framed: 
“1. 
Whether defendant executed an agreement to sell 
dated 04.07.2008 regarding the suit house with the 
plaintiff 
and 
defendant 
also 
received 
the 
consideration amount Rs.5,75,000/- in presence of 
witnesses? OPP 
2. 
Whether plaintiff is entitled to the decree as prayed 
for? OPP 
3. 
Whether suit is liable to be dismissed? OPD 
4. 
Whether defendant is entitled to special costs? OPD 
5. 
Relief.” 
 
Core issue was issue No.1. Burden of proof was on the appellant. In 
support of her contentions, the appellant appeared as PW-3 and 
produced one Syed Zafar ul Hassan Bukhari, Advocate as PW-1, Ch. 
Muhammad Saleem, Advocate, as PW-2, marginal witness of the 

 
 
RSA. No.694/2021 
4 
 
 
 
agreement, namely, Muhammad Yaqoob as PW-4, Muhammad 
Sarwar as PW-5 and Nazar Muhmmad as PW-6. In documentary 
evidence, the agreement was produced as Ex.P1, Register Record of 
Right for the year 1999-2000 as Ex.P2, copy of Mutation No.24 as 
Ex.P3, copy of mutation No.3614 as Ex.P4, copy of plaint of the suit 
titled “Abdul Qayyum v Walayat Baig, etc.” as Ex.P5, copy of 
judgment alongwith decree sheet as Ex.P6, copy of statement of PW-1 
as Ex.P7, copy of amended memorandum of appeal as Ex.P8, copy of 
the judgment alongwith decree sheet as Ex.P9, copy of the suit for 
permanent injunction as Ex.P10, copy of stay order as Ex.P11 and 
Electricity bill as Ex.P12.  
8. 
Conversely, respondent No.1(a), namely, Atlas Bibi appeared 
as DW-1 and produced present respondent No.2, namely, Muhammad 
Sadiq as DW-2 and also produced documentary evidence i.e., copy of 
mutation No.2722 as Ex.D1, copy of mutation No.3137 as Ex.D2, 
copy of mutation No.3226 as Ex.D3, copy of mutation No.3614 as 
Ex.D4, attested copy of Fard Badar No.164 as Ex.D5 and copy of 
Register Record of Rights for the year 1999-2000 as Ex.D6. 
9. 
The Trial Court decreed the suit, whereas, when the evidence 
was re-appraised by the Appellate Court below, the impugned 
judgment was passed and the findings of the Trial Court were 
upended on the ground that the stamp vendor did not appear, who 
issued the stamp paper used for the purpose of preparing the 
agreement; the stamp paper was issued in favour of Muhammad 
Ghaus Baig, who also did not appear; and most importantly, decree 
for specific performance of contract cannot be passed as there was no 
specific stipulation to this effect agreed between the parties, under the 
agreement. Operative part of the impugned judgment reads as under: 
“13. ….. The plaintiff Fareeda Khanum as PW3 in her 
cross-examination also admitted that the Iqrarnama Ex-
P1 does not contain stipulation of execution of 

 
 
RSA. No.694/2021 
5 
 
 
 
Registered Sale Deed or the mutation. Thus even if the 
subject Sale Agreement/Iqrarnama is considered to be 
executed between the parties, it does not contain the 
stipulation, the specific performance of which is prayed 
by the plaintiff. The plaintiff has relied upon a written 
contract/Iqrarnama alleged to be made between the 
parties. It is a well-settled principle of interpretation that 
nothing can be read more than what is written in the 
subject written agreement.  The plaintiff cannot seek the 
specific performance of a term/stipulation which is not 
narrated therein. Thus the plaintiff is not entitled to the 
decree as prayed for by her in the plaint. For all what has 
been discussed above findings of the learned trial court 
upon issues No.1, 2 and 3 are reversed.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
The above-mentioned operative part forms the basis of substantial 
question of law, which primarily requires determination. Before 
addressing the same, I would like to analyze the other two grounds on 
the basis of which findings of the Trial Court were upended by the 
Appellate Court below.  
10. 
The law envisages production of two marginal witnesses of an 
agreement, to prove its execution, in terms of Article 17 read with 
Article 79 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (“QSO”). In present 
case, both the marginal witnesses were produced. In addition, notary 
public also appeared as PW-1, who also supported the stance of the 
appellant. PW-2 is scribe of the agreement albeit his name is not 
recorded in the agreement. Learned counsel for the respondent has not 
pointed out any legal requirement to the effect that scribe must reflect 
his name in the agreement or a litigant must specify so in his 
pleadings. Similarly, production of the stamp vendor who deposes in 
favour of a party can be taken as supporting evidence but his non-
appearance cannot be considered as fatal in view of the fact that 
marginal witnesses of the agreement were produced, who despite 
lengthy cross-examination remained firm with respect to their 
respective deposition. Therefore, reliance placed on case of “Syed 
Abdur Rashid (deceased) through legal heirs supra is misplaced on 

 
 
RSA. No.694/2021 
6 
 
 
 
account of distinguishable facts. More particularly, the unequivocal 
admission of predecessor-in-interest of the respondents/vendor, 
namely Abdul Qayyum Baig, in a suit for partition filed, inter alia, 
against one Walayat Baig and others, is of considerable relevance and 
persuasion. In the said suit for partition, predecessor of the 
respondents categorically admitted that he has sold the suit property 
i.e., house (albeit comprising 08-Marla) to the appellant. Insofar as 
non-appearance of Muhammad Ghaus Baig in whose favour stamp 
paper was issued is concerned, suffice to observe that said 
Muhammad Ghaus Baig is husband of the appellant/plaintiff and his 
non-appearance does not have any bearing on the validity of the 
agreement.  
11. 
At this juncture, it is also imperative to observe that the 
objection of the respondents that predecessor of the respondents only 
obtained 10-Marla out of the 14-Marla suit property, in exchange, in 
the year 2010 whereas the agreement was executed in the year 2008 
and hence, the decree to the extent of house constructed over 14-
Marla land is not enforceable, is also of no help to the respondents 
inasmuch as both the Courts have disbelieved this ground as no one 
from the same Khata/Khewat in which the suit property is situated 
came forward during the pendency of the suit followed by the appeal, 
to lay challenge to the agreement, as well as the excess possession of 
the appellant, if any, over the suit property, which is house 
constructed by the respondents themselves. Even otherwise, any 
defect and/or shortcoming in the title of the vendor-predecessor-in-
interest of the respondents in respect of the suit property, at the time 
of execution of the agreement was cured subsequently when he 
acquired the interest in the suit property after the exchange took place. 
Hence, the agreement having been proved, the decree in suit for 
specific performance of the said agreement is operative against the 
respondents to the extent of interest in the suit property in terms of 

 
 
RSA. No.694/2021 
7 
 
 
 
principle of “feeding the grant by estoppel”  envisaged under Section 
43 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (“the Act 1882”), which 
reads as under:  
“43. Transfer by unauthorized person who 
subsequently acquires interest in property 
transferred.– Where a person fraudulently or 
erroneously represents that he is authorized to 
transfer certain immovable property and 
professes to transfer such property 
for 
consideration, such transfer shall, at the option 
of the transferee, operate on any interest which 
the transferor may acquire in such property at 
any time during which the contract of transfer 
subsists. 
      Noting in this section shall impair the right 
of transferees in good faith for consideration 
without notice of the existence of the said 
option.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
The above quoted provision of the Act, 1882 governs the transfers of 
immovable property where the transferor (predecessor of the 
respondents in present case), to begin with, had no authority to 
transfer the property on account of lack of title and/or interest in said 
immovable property, yet he entered into the agreement with a 
misrepresentation in respect of his title to the property, making the 
other party-the appellant in present case, act on the same and then 
acquired a good title in the property. In such cases, if the transferee 
does not repudiate the contract, the transferee has the option to go 
ahead and seek specific performance of the contract to the extent or 
the interest which the transferor obtained in the property. Willingness 
or otherwise of the transferor to go ahead with the transfer is 
immaterial. Thus, it does not lie in the mouth of the respondents to 
deny their own title in respect of the suit property, regarding which 
their predecessor himself instituted a suit for partition against the co-
owners of the entire khata in which the suit property was situated, got 
recorded a statement that the suit property has been sold to the 

 
 
RSA. No.694/2021 
8 
 
 
 
appellant before this Court albeit taking contradictory stance in 
respect of his own entitlement as well as the sale of the suit property 
and none of the co-sharers objected to entitlement of the suit property.  
12. 
When the evidentiary resume of the case is holistically 
examined, it is well evident that the agreement stood proved and the 
Appellate Court below has taken a jaundiced view of the evidentiary 
resume of the case when the appeal was preferred, by the respondents. 
The Appellate Court below erred in discarding the evidence in general 
and admission on the part of predecessor-in-interest of the 
respondents/vendor that he has sold the property to the appellant in 
particular, by concluding that specific performance of a term (i.e., 
decree to execute a registered sale deed) cannot be passed since the 
said term is not stipulated in the agreement, which takes this Court to 
the legal question formulated hereinabove. 
13. 
The respondents want this Court to hold that since the appellant 
and predecessor of the respondents did not agree by incorporating a 
specific stipulation in the agreement that the latter will execute a 
registered sale deed in favour of the former-the appellant, a decree 
cannot be passed directing the respondents to execute a registered sale 
deed/conveyance in favour of the appellant as no such stipulation 
exists in the agreement, the specific performance whereof could be 
decreed. The argument is flawed and the reasoning put forth by the 
Appellate Court below is against the law.  
14. 
In this regard, it is imperative to understand the law governing 
execution of the contract in general and the agreements related to 
immovable property in particular. The provisions of the Contract Act, 
1872 read with Section 55 of the Act 1882  contain the answer to the 
core controversy in this case. Section 55 of the Act 1882 contemplates 
certain rights and obligations of the buyer and the seller. These 
obligations, imposed by the sanction of law, are covenants and are in 
the nature of statutory obligations, the breach whereof confers a right 

 
 
RSA. No.694/2021 
9 
 
 
 
on either party to take legal recourse, which, inter alia, includes, the 
duty of the seller “to execute the proper conveyance”. The relevant 
clause of Section 55 of the Act 1882 reads as under: 
“55. Rights and liabilities of buyer and seller.–  
In the absence of a contract to the contrary, the 
buyer and the seller of immovable property 
respectively are subject to the liabilities, and have 
the rights, mentioned in the rules next following, 
or such of them as are applicable to the property 
sold: 
      (1)  The seller is bound– 
(a) ..... 
(b) ..... 
(c) ..... 
(d) on payment or tender of the amount 
due in respect of the price, to execute a 
proper conveyance of the property 
when the buyer tenders it to him for 
execution at a proper time and place;” 
         
       
 
         (Emphasis supplied)   
Perusal of the above quoted provisions indicates that in the absence of 
contract to the contrary, it is the duty of the seller-the respondents in 
present case, to execute the proper conveyance, on the payment of the 
amount due in respect of the price. Conveyance means the transfer of 
ownership that is done by signing of the sale deed. Here it will be 
appropriate to understand the meaning and scope of the term “contract 
to the contrary”. It is a significant concept in various legal contexts, 
particularly in relations to the transfer of property allowing the parties 
to deviate from the statutory provisions through explicit agreements. It 
refers to an agreement that explicitly contradicts statutory provisions 
or established legal principles, in present case clause (d) of sub-
section (1) of Section 55 of the Act 1882, quoted hereinabove. 
However, such contracts to the contrary must be clear and 
unambiguous to effectively override the statutory obligations. Without 

 
 
RSA. No.694/2021 
10 
 
 
 
an express term to the contrary, the statutory obligations envisaged 
under the law remain operative. While the contracts to the contrary 
can be implied, they must be sufficiently clear to indicate an intention 
to deviate from statutory provisions and the ambiguity may lead to the 
enforcement of the statutory provisions instead. Thus, in the absence 
of contract to the contrary, the rights and corresponding liabilities of 
seller and buyer envisaged under the law are to be read as part and 
parcel of the agreement(s) executed by them respectively.  
15.  
Having above legal position in respect of the statutory 
obligations of the parties in a contract of sale of immovable property 
in sight, it has been noted that the agreement between the parties 
brought on record by the appellant as Exh.P1 does not contain any 
such deviation from the statutory obligation of the respondents to 
execute a conveyance/sale deed. Even otherwise, the Courts will not 
enforce contracts that are contrary to the public policy, even if they 
are treated as the contracts to the contrary. Therefore, this Court is of 
the opinion that the Appellate Court below erred in upending the 
findings of the Trial Court on the ground that a decree cannot be 
passed in a suit for specific performance of contract, based on a 
written agreement to sell that does not contain a stipulation regarding 
registration of a sale deed in respect of the immovable property 
forming subject matter of the sale.  
16. 
The matter can be examined from another angle. During the 
course of arguments, few pointed questions were asked to learned 
counsel for the respondents as to how the suit property i.e., house 
could be constructed by predecessor of the respondents when he was 
not the owner of the suit property, in the year 2008, and only 
exchanged the land with respondent No.2 in the year 2010; and the 
reasons why the possession was handed over to the appellant, who 
was admittedly a complete stranger to predecessor of the respondents. 
There was complete silence on the part of learned counsel for 

 
 
RSA. No.694/2021 
11 
 
 
 
respondents, however, he submitted that that possession was illegally 
obtained by the appellant. He was then confronted with statement of 
respondent No.1(a)/Atlas Bibi (DW-1), who acknowledged that the 
suit property was given for residence, without any assertion qua any 
illegality committed by the appellant, which implies that the transfer 
of the possession of the suit property was lawful and pursuant to the 
agreement executed between the appellant and predecessor of the 
respondents. In fact, the respondent side has taken contradictory 
stance regarding the possession of the suit property with the appellant 
and their case falls under the clutches of maxim “Allegans Contraria 
Non Est Audiendus” - A person who alleges things contradictory to 
each other is not to be heard, hence, disentitling the respondents from 
any relief. 
 
17. 
In view of the above discussion, the present appeal merits 
acceptance and is allowed. As a corollary, the impugned judgment 
passed by the Appellate Court below is set aside and that of the Trial 
Court is restored. No order as to costs.
