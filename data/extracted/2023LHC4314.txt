Raheel Kamran J:- The petitioners have assailed the 
judgment and decree dated 17.10.2022 passed by the learned 
Additional District Judge, Faisalabad whereby suit filed by 
respondent No.1 was decreed while allowing his appeal.  
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that respondent No.1/plaintiff 
instituted a suit for confirmation of possession through specific 
performance of agreement to sell alleging therein that the 
petitioners developed a housing scheme with the name and style 
of Muhammad Ali Housing Scheme, situated at Chak 
No.222/RB, Faisalabad and respondent No.1 purchased plot 
No.134/C, measuring 6-Marlas 1-Sarsai, 2-Sqft from him 
against the consideration of Rs.2,447,407/- in presence of the 
witnesses, out of which an amount of Rs.489,481/- was paid as 
earnest money and possession was delivered and it was settled 
that remaining payment would be made through installments.  It 
was further averred in the plaint that the petitioners got 
sanctioned the site plan and with their permission respondent 
No.1 raised construction over the plot.  It was also stated in the 
plaint that respondent No.1/plaintiff paid all installments as per 

2 
C.R.76121 of 2022. 
 
schedule making payment of an amount of Rs.1,957,916/- out of 
the total consideration and was ready to pay the remaining sale 
consideration of an amount of Rs.489,491/-, however, the 
petitioners did not make any development in the society as per 
their promise rather they sent a notice dated 21.06.2018 to 
respondent No.1/plaintiff to make payment of extra land.  The 
petitioners-defendants contested the said suit by filing written 
statement while controverting the stance of respondent No.1-
plaintiff.  It was inter alia averred in the written statement that 
respondent No.1-plaintiff committed default in the payment of 
7th and 8th installments for an amount of Rs.489,491/- and was 
liable to late payment charges under clause 15 of the 
agreement/allotment letter amounting to Rs.126,962/- as on 
14.09.2018.  Prayer was made therein for dismissal of the suit.  
Out of divergent pleadings of the parties, as many as five issues 
were framed. The respondent-plaintiff deposited remaining 
installments/consideration in the trial Court vide order dated 
26.08.2019. After recording evidence of the parties and hearing 
their counsels, the suit was dismissed by the trial Court vide 
judgment and decree dated 08.12.2021. Feeling aggrieved, 
respondent No.1 preferred appeal there-against and the same 
was accepted by the Appellate Court while decreeing his suit 
vide impugned judgment and decree dated 17.10.2022 to the 
following effect: - 
“12. 
……….The plaintiff has categorically stated in his 
plaint that he has purchased suit property (detail fully been 
given in the head note of the plaint) from the defendant against 
consideration of Rs.24,47,407/- and he has already paid 
Rs.19,57,916/- to the defendants while submitting their 
statements leveled an allegation against the plaintiff/appellant 
that the plaintiff/appellant has made default regarding 
payment of remaining installments of the consideration 
amount; due to that reason, the defendants are entitled to 
receive late payment surcharge from the plaintiff/appellant. In 
these circumstances, execution of an agreement to sell in 
shape of allotment latter Exh.P1 has frankly been admitted by 
the defendants through their written statement; whereas, the 
appellant/plaintiff while showing his good intention has 
already deposited remaining installments/consideration 
amount in the learned trial court vide its order dated 
26.08.2019. Now question arises as to whether the defendants 
are entitled to receive late payment surcharge from the 

3 
C.R.76121 of 2022. 
 
plaintiff/appellant, the Hon’ble Lahore High Court, Lahore 
through its esteemed judgment PLD 2015 CLD 1439 has 
answered this question and held that as such kind of late 
payment surcharge is un-Islamic and illegal. This court has 
further gone through contents of agreement to sell/allotment 
latter dated 27.07.2015 Exh.P1 and it has observed that time 
was not essence of the contract rather it has provided penal 
clause of late payment surcharge which is otherwise is illegal 
and un-Islamic. When possession of the suit property has 
already been handed over to the plaintiff and he has raised 
constructions 
upon 
the 
said 
suit 
property; 
the 
appellant/plaintiff is entitled to discretionary relief of specific 
performance as he has already paid entire consideration 
amount to the defendants and in the learned trial court vide its 
order dated 26.08.2019. In these circumstances, this court is 
of considered view that the plaintiff has successfully proved 
this issue; hence, this issue is decided in favour of the 
plaintiff.”  
 
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the 
petitioner was entitled to late payment surcharge in terms of 
clause-15 of the agreement/allotment letter issued to respondent 
No.1 which has been disregarded by the Appellate Court while 
erroneously relying on judgment of this Court in the case of 
“Muhammad Farooq Azam v. Bank Al-Falah Limited and 
others” (2015 CLD 1439).  According to him, the said judgment 
is distinguishable on facts inasmuch as the same related to 
banking transaction whereas in the instant case late payment 
charges were payable under Section 74 of the Contract Act, 
1872. He finally contends that even otherwise the suit of 
respondent No.1 could not be decreed in view of the provisions 
of Section 24(b) of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 as respondent 
failed to fulfil his part of performance as per agreement to 
sell/allotment letter which was an admitted fact.  
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for respondent No.1 
contends that the respondent in this case had paid an amount of 
Rs.1,957,916/- to the petitioners out of the sale consideration 
and remaining amount of Rs.489,491/- was paid pursuant to the 
order passed by the trial Court. He further contends that dispute 
in this case is essentially regarding late payment charges for 
which the petitioners issued notice dated 15.11.2017 while 
claiming payable amount to be Rs.51,553/- in terms of clause 15 

4 
C.R.76121 of 2022. 
 
of the agreement/allotment letter. He maintains that possession 
of the suit property had already been delivered to respondent 
No.1, therefore, the contract stood substantially performed on 
his part. He finally contends that clause 15 of the 
agreement/allotment letter was not enforceable against the 
respondent/plaintiff as such but subject to determination by the 
trial Court of reasonable compensation not exceeding the 
amount so specified therein in terms of Section 74 of the 
Contract Act, 1872 which exercise was never carried out by the 
courts below.  
5. 
Heard. Available record perused with assistance of the 
parties.  
6. 
There is legal presumption in view of explanation to 
section 12 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 that the breach of 
contract to transfer an immovable property cannot be adequately 
relieved by compensation in money.  The burden to dislodge the 
above legal presumption is on the one who avers contrary to it. 
No doubt the jurisdiction to decree specific performance is 
discretionary, however, the exercise of such discretion is not 
arbitrary but reasonable and is guided by the judicial principles. 
In the suit for specific performance, if plaintiff makes any 
express averment in the pleadings of his readiness and 
willingness to perform his part of the contract and deposits the 
balance sale price as per direction of the Court then it would not 
be deemed to be his incapability of performing his part of the 
contract as envisaged under section 24(b) of the Specific Relief 
Act, 1877 rendering the contract non-enforceable, the suit 
cannot be dismissed.  Reliance in this regard is placed on the 
case of Muhammad Asif Awan vs. Dawood Khan and others 
(2021 SCMR 1270).  This Court finds the reasons recorded by 
the Appellate Court in paragraph No.12 of the impugned 
judgment, reproduced herein above, to be unexceptionable in so 

5 
C.R.76121 of 2022. 
 
far as the decree for specific performance cannot be refused to 
the respondent-plaintiff in the facts and circumstances of the 
instant case.  The only question, however, is whether respondent 
No.1 is bound to pay the late payment charges on account of his 
failure to pay the installments on agreed dates?  In this regard, 
the trial Court framed issue No.3, which is reproduced 
hereunder: - 
 
“3. 
Whether the defendants are entitled to 
receive late payment charges? OPD” 
 
The trial Court, vide its judgment dated 08.12.2021, decided the 
said issue in favour of the petitioners whereas the Appellate 
Court, vide impugned judgment, decided it against them while 
finding clause 15 of the agreement/allotment letter regarding 
surcharge against the injunctions of Islam.   
7. 
It is noteworthy that clause (2) of Article 175 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (“the 
Constitution”) provides that no Court shall have any jurisdiction 
save as is or may be conferred on it by the Constitution or by or 
under any law.  The jurisdiction to declare any law or provision 
of law repugnant to the injunctions of Islam, as laid in the Holy 
Quran and the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet, is vested in the 
Federal Shariat Court under Article 203D of the Constitution 
whereas Article 203G of the Constitution imposes a bar upon 
any other Court or Tribunal including the Supreme Court, except 
for appeal before the Shariat Appellate Bench of the Supreme 
Court under Article 203F, to entertain proceedings or to exercise 
any power or jurisdiction in respect of any matter within the 
power or jurisdiction of the Shariat Court.  The Appellate Court 
clearly lacked jurisdiction to declare any provision of the 
agreement/allotment letter to be repugnant to the injunctions of 
Islam.  Validity and enforceability of any such provision is to be 
adjudicated on the touchstone of section 74 of the Contract Act, 

6 
C.R.76121 of 2022. 
 
1872.  For that reason, the Appellate Court has erroneously 
relied upon the judgment of this Court in the case of Muhammad 
Farooq Azam v. Bank Al-Falah Limited and others (2015 CLD 
1439) to declare clause 15 of the agreement/allotment letter to 
be un-Islamic and unenforceable.  Additionally, the afore-
mentioned judgment was rendered in a banking case, which 
manifestly has no relevance in the instant case.   
8. 
Section 74 of the Contract Act, 1872 deals with a contract 
which provides the amount of compensation in the form of 
penalty or liquidated damages in case of breach.  It postulates 
that in such cases, the party complaining of the breach, whether 
or not actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused 
thereby to receive from the party who has broken the contract, 
reasonable compensation not exceeding the amount so named or 
as the case may be the penalty stipulated for the breach.  In the 
case of Province of West Pakistan v. Mistri Patel and Co. (PLD 
1969 Supreme Court 80), it has been held by the Supreme 
Court: 
“The award of compensation by the Court under section 
74 of the Contract Act, will depend upon its finding as to 
what in the facts and circumstances of the case is 
reasonable compensation subject to the limit of the amount 
mentioned in the contract.”   
 
It has been further held by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the 
case of Khanzada Muhammad Abdul Haq Khan Khatak and Co. 
vs. WAPDA (1991 SCMR 1436):  
“Where an amount is mentioned in the contract as penalty 
payable on breach of contract, the parties are entitled to 
recover actual damages not exceeding the amount mentioned 
in the contract but in case of liquidated damages, a party is 
entitled to recover the same from the opposite party in case 
of breach of contract.  However, where the Court considers 
that the amount mentioned in the contract as liquidated 
damages is oppressive, or highly penal in nature the Court 
may refrain to grant such amount and itself determine the 
amount which is reasonable in the circumstances of a 
particular case.” (Emphasis supplied by this Court)

9. 
Clause 15 of the agreement/allotment letter stipulates late 
payment charges of Rs.1000/- per day for default in the payment 
of installment due on 10th of each month, otherwise the plot was 
not to be transferred. The aforementioned clause manifestly 
postulates compensation of late payment charges of Rs.1000/- 
per day at a uniform rate regardless of the differences in the total 
amount of default in each case. Undisputedly, there was delay in 
the payment of 7th and 8th installments on part of respondent 
No.1 despite delivery of possession of the plot in question to 
him.  The petitioners are entitled to reasonable late payment 
charges for the period of default in the payment of afore-
mentioned installments. This Court, however, finds the amount 
of compensation specified in clause 15 ibid, to be oppressive and 
highly penal in the facts and circumstances of instant case which 
cannot be allowed to the petitioners inasmuch as undisputedly 
respondent No.1 had paid well in time the first six installments 
and the delay was in relation to remaining two installments of 
Rs.489,491/- constituting 25% of the sale consideration for 
which late payment charges at the rate of Rs.1000/- per day (i.e. 
Rs.365,000/- per annum) are manifestly extortionate.  No other 
reasonable amount of compensation has been claimed in the 
written statement and established by the petitioners in the instant 
case.  Since there was no determination by the courts below of 
reasonable compensation, this Court deems it appropriate to 
hold the petitioners entitled to compensation in total of 
Rs.150,000/- for delay in the payment of last two installments 
which were deposited in the trial Court by respondent No.1 vide 
order dated 26.08.2019.  The above figure of compensation is an 
approximation arrived at taking into account the State Bank of 
Pakistan’s interest rates at the relevant time.  
10.    For the foregoing reasons, the titled civil revision is 
disposed of while maintaining the impugned judgment and 

8 
C.R.76121 of 2022. 
 
decree of specific performance passed by the Appellate Court in 
favour of respondent No.1 and against the petitioners subject to 
payment of compensation of late payment charges by respondent 
No.1 to the petitioners as mentioned above. There shall be no 
order as to costs.
