judgment dated 13.09.2022 passed by the learned Additional 
Sessions Judge, Bahawalpur, in connection with case FIR No.512

2
police raiding party headed by Rehan Nadeem, ASI (PW.4) 
conducted raid and apprehended the appellant while sitting on the 
driving seat of a grey colour car, Alto without registration 
number, who was having four packets of ‘charas’ in his lap. 
During search of car, on the pointation of accused/appellant 
further 90-packets of ‘charas’  from different parts of the car were 
also recovered and total contraband in 94-packets was 112-Kgs 
and 800-grams, when weighed. Sale proceed of Rs.120,000/- 
(details mentioned in the complaint [Exh.PE]) was also recovered 
during personal search of the appellant. 
3. 
Prosecution in order to prove its case, produced as many as 
seven witnesses. Learned trial court after completing codal 
formalities, framed charge against the appellant to which he 
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. Muhammad Adnan, SI 
(PW.1) and Ejaz Ahmad, ASI (then Sub-Inspector) (PW.7) are 
Investigation Officers of the case. Ishtiaq Ahmad (PW.2) is owner 
of the car used by the appellant for perpetration of the offence. 
Muhammad Sadique HC/845 (PW.3) being Moharrar received the 
case property, kept it in Malkhana, got transmitted the sample 
parcels to Punjab Forensic Science Agency and also got deposited 
the rest of the case property to ‘Malkhana’ Saddar Bahawalpur. 
Rehan Nadeem, ASI (PW.4) is complainant of the case. PW.5 
Muhammad Saleem 1779/C-II and Muhammad Irfan Nazir, SI 
(PW.6), witnesses of recovery also deposed against the petitioner. 
Prosecution gave up Muhammad Kamran C/1650 and Shoaib 
Aslam, ASI, being unnecessary and closed its evidence after 

Criminal Appeal No.631 of 2022 
 
3
tendering report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency (Exh.PH) 
consisting of two pages. Appellant in his statement recorded 
under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898, refuted 
the allegations and maintained that due to conflict with the 
complainant, false recovery had been planted upon him. 
Appellant neither opted to adduce evidence in his defence nor 
appeared as a witness to state on oath as provided under Section 
340(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. After 
completion of trial, learned trial court convicted and sentenced the 
appellant as mentioned above vide judgment dated 13.09.2022. 
4. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
5. 
It has straightaway been observed that the case against the 
appellant as alleged in the charge is that on 25.08.2021, he was 
nabbed by the raiding party headed by the complainant at 04:40 
p.m. when sitting in a car in possession of 94-packets of ‘charas’ 
besides „Wattak‟ amount of Rs.120,000/- but weight of the 
contraband even separation of narcotic for samples, their weight 
or preparation of parcels thereof and details of the car are not 
mentioned therein. Though in the charge 04:40 p.m. time of 
recovery is given yet none of the three recovery witnesses PW.4, 
PW.5 & PW.6 has substantiated this part of charge. The 
Investigation Officer (PW.7) at the end of his cross-examination 
conceded that none of the witnesses disclosed time of recovery to 
him. The Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, is a special 
law that per the kind and quantity of narcotic provides the 
quantum of sentence separately. Hence, this law requires that the 

Criminal Appeal No.631 of 2022 
 
4
charge must carry specific kind and quantity of narcotic 
recovered and if it is bereft of the same, conviction and sentence 
of the accused against the quantity given by the witnesses in their 
statements would not be justified at all.   
 
Ishtiaq Ahmad, owner of the subject car Suzuki Alto 
bearing registration No.BSV-647, was produced by the 
prosecution during trial as PW.2 who during cross examination 
clarified that when his car was retained at the police station he 
obtained track report of the subject vehicle. He also replied as 
under:- 
“…My vehicle i.e. BSV/647 was having a tracker of 
U-Track car tracking company. I got installed the tracker 
from U-Track company in the month of July 2021. An alert 
message is always sent to owner of vehicle by tracking 
company whenever the ignition of car is switched ON. I 
use to receive the messages of U-Track Company on my 
SIM Card No.0300-5445827. It is correct that every 
movement of vehicle is conveyed by the tracking company 
by sending the location of the vehicle through message. 
Link sent by tracking company can be check by tracking 
the location through the software of U-Track Company. I 
used to receive the location of vehicle mentioned in this 
case also remained checking the same. It is correct that 
tracking company issues report regarding the movement, 
location and alert of vehicle registered with it. When my 
car was detained at police station then I obtained track 
report of this vehicle. 
 
I have brought the track report of vehicle BSV-647 
with me today. Track report is available before me. I 
received alerts from U-Track Company on 24.08.2021 and 
25.08.2021. I also received the location of my vehicle from 
U-Track Company on 24.08.2021 and 25.08.2021. I do not 
remember as to location sent to me about the presence of 
vehicle at 10:22 pm on 24.08.2022. According to track 
report available before me, said vehicle was present at the 

Criminal Appeal No.631 of 2022 
 
5
office of CIA staff, Bahawalpur near Sabzi Mandi on 
24.08.2021 at 10:22 pm. I receive the alert of presence of 
my vehicle mentioned above in the office of Rescue 15 
Model Town-A Bahawalpur at 10:27 pm on 24.08.2021. 
According to track report, said vehicle remained present in 
the office of Rescue 15 Model Town-A on 24.08.2021 from 
10:27 pm. As per track record for whole night of 
24.08.2021 vehicle BSV-647 remained at the office of 
Rescue 15 Model Town-A Bahawalpur. 
 
On 24.08.2021, I after receiving alerts of presence of 
my vehicle at Rescue 15 became worried and after 
checking the location through mobile app, I proceeded to 
police station Saddar, Bahawalpur where I found my 
vehicle parked. On the same night of 24.08.2021, I sought 
information from police station Saddar regarding the 
detention of my vehicle where I was informed that Rizwan 
alias Bublo and my vehicle is detained by the police and 
after seeing them I returned bank. I demanded my vehicle 
back but I was informed that the same would be given after 
obtaining Superdari. Police Station Saddar, Bahawalpur 
and office of Rescue 15 are adjacent. Even my vehicle 
remained at police station Saddar on next morning of 
25.08.2021. I was only informed about the detention of 
Rizwan accused and vehicle on 24.08.2021 but I do not 
know about the investigation of this case. As per track 
report as well as alert messages received to me my vehicle 
BSV-647 
came 
out 
from 
police 
station 
Saddar, 
Bahawalpur/Rescue 15 in the noon of 25.08.2021. It is 
incorrect to suggest that police compelled me to issue 
bogus rental.” 
 
This reproduced part of the statement of a witness produced by 
the prosecution itself reveals that the subject vehicle was in 
possession of Bahawalpur Police on 24.08.2021 and remained so 
till the noon of 25.08.2021. The complainant during his cross 
examination candidly admits that on the next day of the 
registration of this case, he was suspended by the District Police 
Officer, Bahawalpur. He concedes that in the case of 

Criminal Appeal No.631 of 2022 
 
6
Ayyaz-ur-Rehman earlier got registered by him recovered 
contraband was of the description similar to that of the case in 
hand. Likewise, description of recovered ‘charas’ in earlier 
registered case of Raaz Muhammad was also the same. In this 
view of the matter, the argument furnished by learned counsel for 
the appellant to the effect that the contraband recovered from 
others mentioned above has been planted against him could not 
specifically be responded by the learned Prosecutor. The 
argument further finds support from the supra reproduced excerpt 
from the statement of Ishtiaq Ahmad (PW.2). These facts create 
reasonable doubts about the credibility of prosecution story 
canvassed by the recovery witnesses.  
6. 
The appellant as per contents of the crime report disclosed 
that he uses ‘charas’ and also supplies the same to the big dealers 
in different districts of the Punjab but surprisingly neither the 
appellant was got medico legally examined nor his blood test was 
got conducted. It is also relevant to mention here that no intended 
buyer at the place of recovery, the appellant allegedly was 
waiting for, could be arrested and even it was not attempted by 
the complainant and no disclosure regarding dealers in other 
districts of the Punjab could be obtained from the appellant 
during his physical custody. It is also to be noticed that without 
further investigation, the Investigation Officer got him sent to the 
judicial custody on 26.08.2021 i.e. very next day of his arrest. He 
even did not bother to know about and to associate the dealer to 
whom the appellant had already supplied the contraband against 

Criminal Appeal No.631 of 2022 
 
7
the „Wattak‟ amount of Rs.120,000/- recovered from him during 
body search. 
7. 
According to the prosecution case canvassed by the 
witnesses in their examination-in-chief case property allegedly 
recovered on 25.08.2021 was handed over to the Investigation 
Officer Ejaz Ahmad, SI (PW.7) by Rehan Nadeem, ASI (PW.4), 
complainant of this case, in the shape of parcels besides ‘wattak’ 
amount of Rs.120,000/- (P.102 to 141), threads (P.99) and 
polythene bags (P.95 & P.96) which were given to the Moharrar 
(PW.3) by Investigation Officer (PW.7) on the return of police 
party to the police station immediately but surprisingly 
complainant (PW.4) as well as the recovery witness Muhammad 
Irfan Nazir, SI (PW.6) during cross examination concedes that 
complainant (PW.4) Rehan Nadeem, ASI convened a press 
conference at the police station on the day of recovery wherein 
none from the police party who captured the contraband and the 
accused/appellant except the complainant was visible in the 
photograph of press conference. In the said picture admittedly 
parcels of contraband are visible lying on the table in large 
number. The recovery witnesses in this regard are discrepant as 
according to PW.4 & PW.6 press conference took place at police 
station on 25.08.2021 but PW.5 denies the press conference on 
25.08.2021. He and PW.6 however, stated that immediately on 
return to the police station, the Investigation Officer (PW.7) 
deposited the case property with the Moharrar Muhammad 
Sadique (PW.3) and it was placed in ‘Malkhana’ thereafter. How 

Criminal Appeal No.631 of 2022 
 
8
and when the complainant received back the case property in 
absence of other members of the raiding party and how and when 
he deposited the same back to ‘Malkhana’ is a fact that has not 
been explained by any of the witnesses as the prosecution case is 
silent in this regard. The Investigation Officer (PW.7) during his 
cross examination has categorically stated that he never returned 
the parcels to the complainant after receiving the same from him. 
He also stated voluntarily that soon after bringing the parcels of 
contraband he got them deposited in Malkhana of Police Station 
and never produced before the DPO or any court. The vehicle 
used by the appellant for perpetration of the offence as per 
prosecution case was produced in the court but at that time the 
back of rear seat was intact while Muhammad Saleem 1779/C-II 
(PW.5) during cross examination stated as under:- 
“Back seat of the car of accused was torn by the accused 
for producing the contraband to us. Investigation officer 
weighted the contraband with the help of digital scale. 
Rehan Nadeem ASI is the complainant of this case whereas 
Ejaz Ahmad SI is the investigating officer of this case.” 
 
The reply given during the cross examination of Rehan Nadeem, 
ASI (PW.4) on that point reads as under:- 
“It is correct that meter reading of the vehicle P-101 
brought in the court today is 36659 KM. It is correct that 
back seats of P-101 are neither torn from front side nor 
from backside. Partial plastic paper which usually available 
with the new cars is also present on the back seat of car. It 
is correct that back seat of the car is completely covered 
with its covering cloth and even stitching all around of the 
back seat of the car is available. Volunteered a separate 
cover was available at the time of recovery of Chars which 

Criminal Appeal No.631 of 2022 
 
9
is not present today in this car. It is correct that the only 
cover available on back seat of the case is intact.” 
 
The other material contradiction between the witnesses is that 
according to recovery witnesses nothing was written on the 
recovered packets of contraband but during cross examination of 
Ejaz Ahmad, ASI (PW.6) the parcels were desealed inside the 
court and the answers given by the said witness goes as under:- 
“It is correct that at present writing with bold blue marker 
in English and Urdu is available on the packet of de-sealed 
parcel. It is correct that writing is available on both sides of 
other de-sealed parcel with blue pen. It is correct that the 
same writing is available on 3rd and 4th parcels is available. 
It is correct that words Afridi-A is written on 5th parcel.” 
 
It, in our opinion, shows that these witnesses actually never ever 
saw the contraband before it was produced in the Court. 
8. 
We have also noticed that the three witnesses of recovery 
are not consistent even with regard to the place of recovery. 
According to the statement of Muhammad Irfan Nazir, SI (PW.6) 
place of recovery was situated at a distance of 10 to 15 feet from 
the road while Muhammad Saleem 1779/C-II (PW.5) stated that 
road was far behind the place of recovery. Controverting both 
Rehan Nadeem, the complainant (PW.4), stated that place of 
recovery was situated on the road though it is not a busy road. 
PW.5 & PW.6 even confute each other qua the writing available 
on the parcels of contraband statedly prepared by the 
complainant. Per the statement of PW.5, parcels were carrying 
the writing of Investigation Officer while the other witness 

Criminal Appeal No.631 of 2022 
 
10
(PW.6) states that complainant did the same though both claim 
their availability at the relevant time.  
9. 
Perusal of the statements of Moharrar Muhammad Sadique 
HC/845 (PW.3) and that of  Ejaz Ahmad, ASI (PW.7) reflects 
remarkable 
inconsistencies 
as 
Moharrar 
(PW.3) 
in 
his 
examination-in-chief and cross examination has stated that on 
18.09.2021 he handed over 94-sealed parcels of ‘charas’ of 
remaining quantity and „Wattak‟ amount of Rs.120,000/- to Ejaz 
Ahmad, SI/NIV for their transmission to Malkhana Saddar 
Bahawalpur and the Investigation Officer also recorded his 
statement under Section 161 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 
1898, in this regard but during cross examination he also stated as 
under:- 
“It is correct that in road certificate No.1103 of this case 
regarding deposit of articles in Malkhana Saddar. There is 
nothing mentioned regarding deposit of plastic bags, 
threads, amount Rs.1,20,000/- and ALTO car. It is correct 
that except road certificate No.1103 no other road 
certificate regarding depositing any other articles in 
Malkhana Saddar is available on judicial file as well as 
police file.” 
 
 
The said witness also concedes in the next paragraph of his 
statement that there was no case diary dated 18.09.2021 in police 
file. Relevant part of the second last and last paragraphs of his 
statement reads as under:- 
“Police file of this case is present before me. It is correct 
that there is no case diary dated 18.09.2021 in police file. 
 
It is correct that I am duty bound to incorporate a 
rappat in station diary whenever I received any articles 

Criminal Appeal No.631 of 2022 
 
11
from any police officer. It is also correct that even at the 
time of handing over of any article to any police officer by 
me, incorporation of a rappat is a legal requirement. I 
incorporated rappat in station diary at the time of receiving 
articles from the police officer and even at the time of 
handing over of articles. On record of this case only rappat 
number 28/2 is available which was incorporated on my 
behalf. It is correct that no detail any case property is 
mentioned in rappat No.28/2. It is correct that only 
available rappat is of dated 25.08.2021. It is correct that is 
not mentioned in said rappat as to the person from whom I 
received said articles. It is correct that it is not mentioned in 
the rappat that two whom the articles were further handed 
over. Volunteered that it is mentioned in said rappat that 
articles were kept in Malkhana of police station.” 
 
But when we go through the statement of Ejaz Ahmad, ASI 
(PW.7) he though supports the statement of PW.3 to the effect 
that on 18.09.2021 Muhammad Saddique HC/845 (PW.3) handed 
over to him parcels of remaining quantity of charas for onward 
transmission in Malkhana Saddar and the same was submitted 
intact on the same day. He also stated there that he recorded 
statement of Moharrar under Section 161 of the Criminal 
Procedure Code, 1898, but during his cross examination he also 
conceded that on 18.09.2021 he was not the Investigation Officer 
of this case and even he was not posted at Police Station Saddar 
Bahawalpur then. He also concedes as under:- 
“A statement of Muhammad Siddique Moharrur, dated 
18.09.2021 is available on file written by me. It is correct 
that date 18.09.2021 on said statement is of different pen. It 
is incorrect to suggest that hand writing of statements of 
rest of PWs is different than the hand writing of statement 
of Muhammad Siddique/845-HC…It is correct that every 
proceeding of investigating officer requires to be recorded 
in case diary. Incomplete report u/s 173, Cr.P.C., dated 

Criminal Appeal No.631 of 2022 
 
12
31.08.2021 was maintained vide case diary No.4. I do not 
remember whether I recorded any case diary after 
31.08.2021. It is correct that there is no case diary, dated 
18.09.2021 on record. Except mentioned in examination in 
chief today, I nowhere recorded in entire investigation of 
this case about receiving of any article from Moharrur on 
18.09.2021 
and 
its 
deposit 
in 
Malkhana 
Saddar. 
Volunteered said proceedings were not the part of police 
investigation due to this I did not mention in my 
proceedings. I do not remember whether I made any 
statement before investigating officer of this case regarding 
receiving of parcels from Moharrur and its deposit in 
Malkhana Saddar. It is correct that no such statement is 
available on record of this case…Statement of Moharrur, 
dated 18.09.2021, is recorded mistakenly by me. I was not 
competent to record the statement of any witness on 
18.09.2021. It is correct that I was not competent to 
proceed with the investigation of this case on 18.09.2021. I 
did not object before the then investigating officer 
regarding my incompetency to investigate this case on 
18.09.2021. I do not remember the time when I received 
the file of this case on 18.09.2021. I was present at P.S. 
Saddar, Bahawalpur when I receive the file of this case on 
18.09.2021. I do not remember the name of then SHO. I 
was having no order of any police authority to investigate 
of this case on 18.09.2021. I do not know whether 
investigation of this case was ever changed. I did not record 
the statement of incharge Malkhana on 18.09.2021 or 
thereof. I do not remember whether I incorporate any rapat 
at P.S. Saddar, Bahawalpur on 18.09.2021.” 
 
The Investigation Officer also admitted that witnesses of this case 
did not verify the handing over of any article to him by Rehan 
Nadeem, ASI/complainant (PW.4) at the spot in their statements 
recorded under Section 161 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 
1898. He further expressed that he could not tell the date when he 
prepared the parcel of currency notes and when same was 
deposited in double lock of treasury. He also conceded that when 

Criminal Appeal No.631 of 2022 
 
13
he prepared the parcel of currency notes and deposited in the 
treasury, investigation of the case was being conducted by 
Muhammad Adnan, SI (PW.1), though he again stated that he 
was not sure about this. He also conceded that Moharrar (PW.3) 
stated nothing in his statement regarding handing over the 
currency notes to him. Collective consideration of the facts 
mentioned above leads us to hold that evidence produced by the 
prosecution in this case is swerving besides being materially 
inconsistent. Harsh sentences carried by the relevant penal 
provisions of Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, require 
strict scrutiny of evidence produced against the accused but from 
the facts mentioned above, we are of the considered opinion that 
in this case prosecution remained fail to establish its case against 
the appellant beyond shadow of a reasonable doubt. In Ayub 
Masih v. The State” (PLD 2002 SC 1048), at page 1056 the 
Hon‟ble Apex Court has been pleased to observe as under:- 
“….It is hardly necessary to reiterate that the prosecution is 
obliged to prove its case against the accused beyond any 
reasonable doubt and if it fails to do so the accused is 
entitled to the benefit of doubt as of right.  It is also firmly 
settled that if there is an element of doubt as to the guilt of 
the accused the benefit of that doubt must be extended to 
him. The doubt of course must be reasonable and not 
imaginary or artificial.  The rule of benefit of doubt, which 
is described as the golden rule, is essentially a rule of 
prudence which cannot be ignored while dispensing justice 
in accordance with law.  It is based on the maxim, “it is 
better that ten guilty persons be acquitted rather than one 
innocent person be convicted”.  In simple words it means 
that utmost care should be taken by the Court in convicting 
an accused.  It was held in The State v. Mushtaq Ahmad 
(PLD 1973 SC 418) that this rule is antithesis of haphazard 

Criminal Appeal No.631 of 2022 
 
14
approach or reaching a fitful decision in a case.  It will not 
be out of place to mention here that this rule occupies a 
pivotal place in the Islamic Law and is enforced rigorously 
in view of the saying of the Holy Prophet (p.b.u.h) that the 
“mistake of Qazi (Judge) in releasing a criminal is better 
than his mistake in punishing an innocent.”  
 
10. 
There is no cavil about the proposition that even a single 
reasonable doubt in the prosecution case is sufficient to warrant 
acquittal of the accused. In the light of above discussion, Crl. 
Appeal No.631 of 2022 filed by Muhammad Rizwan Ahmed 
alias Bablo (appellant/convict) is accepted, his conviction and 
sentence recorded by the learned trial court is set aside and he is 
acquitted of the charge levelled against him by extending him the 
benefit of doubt. He is in jail, be released forthwith if not required 
to be detained in connection with any other criminal case. Case 
property, the car, be released in favour of its owner in accordance 
with law.
