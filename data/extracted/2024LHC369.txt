also directed to pay compensation of Rs.3,00,000/- each to 
the legal heirs of the each deceased under section 544-A 
Cr.P.C, in default thereof, to further undergo six months 
simple imprisonment on three counts. 
 
2. 
Brief facts as narrated by complainant Ghulam Raza in the above 
mentioned FIR are as under;- 
“The complainant married her sister Rafia Rani with Ghulam Abbas about 
02-years prior to the said occurrence, after one year from the marriage 
complainant's sister Rafia Rani (deceased) alongwith her husband Ghulam 
Abbas (accused) living in Madrassa Bint-e-Zainab, situated at Ada 
Chabbeal, Hando Road, Lahore in connection to earn lively hood; about 
15/20 days prior to said occurrence Ghulam Zohra (deceased) mother of the 
complainant came at Lahore in the house of her daughter Rafia Rani. On 
01.12.2012 at about 08:00/09:00 a.m Mst. Rafia Rani telephonically 
informed complainant's brother Muhammad Asif that she had a petty 
quarrel with her husband Ghulam Abbas, so she asked her brother 
Muhammad Asif to come and bring her and her mother back from the house 
of Ghulam Abbas. Upon which Muhammad Asif (deceased) telephonically 
informed the complainant that he is going to Lahore and you should also 
reach there, so complainant alongwith Muhammad Ramzan son of Ahmad 
Yar and Mazhar Hussain son of Muhammad Nawaz reached to Lahore. 
They reached at Lahore on 01.12.2012 at about 05:00 pm and saw that 
complainant's mother Ghulam Zohra his sister Rafia Rani and his brother 
Muhammad Asif standing in front of the house of Ghulam Abbas accused, 
who made straight firing upon Rafia Rani, Zohra Bibi and Muhammad Asif, 
one fire hit Rafia Rani on left side of her thigh, two fires hit on her belly and 
two fires hit on her belly button and she fell down, two fires hit Zohra Bibi 
on her left side of her rib and she fell down, accused made straight firing 
upon Muhammad Asif and he fell down in injured condition. Ambulance of 
1122 came there and picked up the injured persons and shifted them to 
Ganga Ram Hospital, Lahore. Complainant's mother Zohra Bibi succumbed 
to the injures on the way, Mst. Rafia Rani succumbed to the injuries in the 
hospital. Later on injured Muhammad Asif also died in Jinnah Hospital, 
Lahore.” 
3. 
Dr. Atfa Naheed, Senior Demonstrator Forensic Department KEMU, 
Lahore, who conducted postmortems upon the dead bodies of Zohra Bibi 
and Mst. Rafia Rani, appeared as (PW-8), Dr. Ahmad Raza Khan DML, 
Forensic Medicine Department KEMU, Lahore, who conducted autopsy 
upon the dead body of Muhammad Asif, appeared as (PW-11) and Dr. 
Nosheen Iram PGR/Woman Medical Officer, who initially examined Rafia 
Rani and Muhammad Asif, in injured condition, appeared as (PW-16). 
4. 
After registration of the case, investigation was carried out by the 
police and on culmination of the same, the Investigating Agency submitted 
report u/s 173 Cr.P.C. before the learned trial Court by placing the name of 
appellant in column No.3, whereas names of co-accused, Sikandar Hayat 

 
3 
Murder Reference No.319 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No.78701 of 2019 
Criminal Revision No.63816 of 2019 
and Ghulam Raza were placed in column No.2, however, both the co-
accused were also summoned alongwith the appellant to face the trial, 
wherein charge was framed, which was denied by them, hence, trial 
commenced. It is pertinent to mention here that during the pendency of the 
trial, above said co-accused Sikandar Hayat and Ghulam Raza filed 
application u/s 265-K Cr.P.C., which was allowed and both of them were 
acquitted of the charge by the learned trial Court vide order dated 
16.09.2013.  
5. 
In order to prove its case against the appellant, the prosecution 
produced as many as nineteen witnesses. Ocular account was furnished by 
complainant Ghulam Raza (PW-3) and eye witness Rana Mazhar Hussain 
(PW-4). Investigation of the case was conducted by Muhammad Nawas SI 
(PW-18), whereas remaining PWs were of formal in nature. Thereafter, the 
prosecution closed its evidence by producing certain documentary 
evidence. After recording the prosecution evidence, appellant was 
examined u/s 342 Cr.P.C., wherein he denied all the allegations leveled 
against him. He did not opt to record his statement u/s 340(2) Cr.P.C., 
however, produced Muhammad Ramzan as (DW-1) and Muhammad 
Ameer (DW-2) in his defence. Learned trial Court after appraising the 
prosecution evidence convicted and sentenced the appellant in the above 
mentioned terms.  
6. 
In support of the instant appeal, learned counsel for the appellant 
submits that the impugned judgment is result of non-comprehension of 
facts and mis-reading of material evidence available on record; that 
availability of the eye witnesses at the crime scene is seriously 
questionable as they hail from far flung area and keeping in view the other 
facts and circumstances of the case, they can easily be categorized as 
‘chance witnesses’ because they have never plausibly explained their 
presence at the crime scene; that the dying declaration of one of the 
deceased, Muhammad Asif was of no legal sanctity as mandatory legal 
requirements were not fulfilled while recording the same; that there is 
glaring contradiction between ocular account and medical evidence; that 
the prosecution has not asserted any motive for killing three persons at the 

 
4 
Murder Reference No.319 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No.78701 of 2019 
Criminal Revision No.63816 of 2019 
hands of the appellant; that the stated recovery of weapon of offence and 
its positive report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) is rendered 
to be inconsequential as the crime empties were sent after arrest of the 
appellant, hence, other pieces of evidence do not provide any corroboration 
to the ocular account and lastly submits that since the prosecution has 
failed to prove its case ‘beyond shadow of doubt’ hence, by accepting the 
instant appeal, the appellant be acquitted of the charge.       
7. 
By taking exceptions to the arguments of learned counsel for the 
appellant, learned Deputy Prosecutor General assisted by the learned 
counsel for the complainant, has faithfully defended the impugned 
judgment and submits that the prosecution has ably proved its case by 
providing trustworthy, reliable and coherent evidence as both the eye 
witnesses remained firm qua their stance that they had witnessed the 
occurrence, right from the registration of case till recording their 
testimonies before the learned trial Court; that the appellant in connivance 
with his acquitted co-accused, namely, Sikandar Hayat and Ghulam Raza 
had done to death three persons including his wife on account of a trivial 
family dispute with the deceased wife; that dying declaration of 
Muhammad Asif has provided ample support to the prosecution story; that 
weapon of offence i.e. rifle .7 mm got recovered at the instance of the 
appellant during course of investigation and positive report furnished by 
the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) in this regard have also 
provided full corroboration to the ocular account; that since the prosecution 
has proved its case up to the hilt qua the guilt of the appellant, so, there is 
no force in the arguments of learned counsel for the appellant, hence, the 
appeal filed by the appellant is liable to be dismissed and by allowing 
revision petition filed by the complainant, fine imposed by the learned trial 
Court upon the appellant may also be sufficiently enhanced as per law.      
8. 
We have heard arguments of learned counsel for the appellant, 
learned Law Officer, learned counsel for the complainant, have gone 
through the record with their assistance and noticed that the prosecution in 
order to bring home the guilt of the appellant, has relied upon the ocular 
account provided by the complainant, Ghulam Raza (PW-3) and Rana 

 
5 
Murder Reference No.319 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No.78701 of 2019 
Criminal Revision No.63816 of 2019 
Mazhar Hussain (PW-4), eye witnesses, dying declaration in shape of 
statement of one of the deceased Muhammad Asif got recorded in injured 
condition in hospital, evidence of motive provided by the same witnesses, 
medical evidence and the evidence of recovery of weapon of offence i.e. .7 
mm rifle from the appellant. We have straightway observed that in fact the 
complainant, Ghulam Raza (PW-3), while lodging the instant crime report 
had nominated, apart from the appellant, two other co-accused Sikandar 
Hayat and Ghulam Raza with the allegation of abetment but they were 
exonerated from the charge by the Investigating Agency and the 
complainant or the State for that matter neither challenged the findings of 
the Investigating Agency qua the innocence of above said co-accused 
before any forum of police hierarchy nor filed any private complaint. 
Meaning thereby that they were quite satisfied from the outcome of the 
investigation. The incident in this case statedly took place on 01.12.2012 at 
05:00 p.m., whereas the same was reported to the police by the 
complainant Ghulam Raza, while making statement (Ex-PC) to the police 
at 07:30 p.m. in Ganga Ram Hospital, Lahore and the same was converted 
into formal FIR (Ex-PDD) at 08:15 p.m. on the same day.  Learned 
counsel for the appellant has argued that the FIR (Ex-PDD) was lodged 
with an inordinate delay of about three hours but on going through the 
contents of the same, we have noticed that in fact none of the deceased 
expired at the crime scene, rather all of them were shifted to hospital in 
injured condition and Mst. Zohra Bibi succumbed to the wound on the way 
to hospital, whereas Mst. Rafia Rani breathed her last after reaching 
hospital and Muhammad Asif was got admitted in Ganga Ram Hospital in 
injured condition. So in that eventuality, apparently, machinery of law was 
set into motion by the complainant Ghulam Raza with a reasonable 
promptitude. However, to ascertain truthfulness and sanctity of eye 
witnesses qua their claim that they were present at the crime scene and 
they had witnessed the incident, we have straightway observed that both 
the eye witnesses adduced by the prosecution i.e. Ghulam Raza (PW-3) 
and Rana Mazhar Hussain (PW-4), hailed from District Sargodha and it 
was claimed that complainant Ghulam Raza (PW-3), on receiving 

 
6 
Murder Reference No.319 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No.78701 of 2019 
Criminal Revision No.63816 of 2019 
information qua the quarrel between appellant and Mst. Rafia Rani, his 
sister on telephone call allegedly made by Muhammad Asif deceased, they 
alongwith one Ramzan (not produced) reached at the house of appellant, 
Ghulam Abbas alias Agha situated at Adda Chabbeal, District Lahore, the 
place situated within the precincts of Police Station Manawan and when 
they reached at the house of the appellant, at that point of time, all the three 
deceased alongwith appellant were standing outside of house of the 
appellant and in their view, the appellant made fatal firing on all the three 
persons, who later on succumbed to the wounds. So, apparently, stance of 
the eye witnesses that they reached at the crime scene exactly at the same 
time when the appellant made firing at the persons of the deceased from a 
far flung place i.e. District Sargodha about 170 kilometers away from 
Lahore, is hard to believe. However, we have further scanned the record to 
verify this stance of the PWs and observed that the complainant claimed 
that after receiving the injuries, all the three injured were shifted to hospital 
through Rescue 1122 and the complainant and other PWs also 
accompanied them but unfortunately, no official from the office of Rescue 
1122 was produced before the learned trial Court to verify the stance of the 
eye witnesses. 
9. 
We have also gone through the medical evidence i.e. Medico Legal 
Certificates (MLCs) of Mst. Rafia Rani and Muhammad Asif (Ex-PL & 
Ex-PM) and noticed that in the relevant columns of ‘accompanied by’ was 
kept blank. So, these two documents belied stance of the eye witnesses that 
in fact they had accompanied the deceased to hospital in injured condition 
and this fact also raises our eyebrows qua the truthfulness of their stance 
qua their availability and witnessing the occurrence. On going through the 
medical evidence, we feel that there is force in the arguments of learned 
counsel for the appellant that there is contradiction between ocular account 
and medical evidence. In the FIR complainant claims that fire shots made 
by the appellant hit Mst. Rafia Rani at the thigh, abdomen and at her 
armpit but on going through her postmortem report (Ex-PH) and testimony 
of Dr. Atfa Naheed (PW-8), who noted two lacerated wounds on back of 
right chest and nothing was observed at her armpit, whereas the 

 
7 
Murder Reference No.319 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No.78701 of 2019 
Criminal Revision No.63816 of 2019 
complainant has not mentioned that Mst. Rafia Rani had received any 
injury at the back of chest, so, the medical evidence is not in line with the 
prosecution story, rather it contradicts the same. 
10. 
We have also gone through the scaled and un-scaled site plans (Ex-
PX & Ex-PA respectively) and noticed that place of occurrence is situated 
in a thickly populated area and there are houses all around and a Madrassa 
Zainab Bint-e-Ali on one side, whereas Al-Hadi Educational Academy on 
the other side and there is also a chowk ‘چوک’ nearby and the time of 
incident was before the evening i.e. 05:00 p.m. but none from the locality, 
has come forward in support of the prosecution case. We are mindful of the 
fact that in these days common people hardly show readiness to appear 
before the police or to depose before the learned trial Court in order to 
avoid rigours and hardships of investigation and protracted trial but at the 
same time, we feel that since there was a Madrassa Zainab bint-e-Ali and 
an Educational Academy around the place of occurrence, so, someone 
should come to depose in support of the prosecution case, especially in the 
circumstances that the appellant was living in upper story of the said 
Madrassa.          
11. 
We have also observed that stance of the eye witnesses regarding the 
involvement of co-accused Khizar Hayat and Ghulam Raza s/o Muzammal 
Hussain had been disbelieved by the Investigating Agency, so, we hold 
that status of both these eye witnesses is not more than mere chance 
witnesses and there is hardly any doubt in the legal proposition that the 
conviction and sentence can be based upon the testimony of chance 
witnesses if that is sufficiently corroborated by the other pieces of evidence 
coming forth from independent sources.  
12. 
For this purpose, we have analyzed other pieces of evidence relied 
upon by the prosecution and observed that the prosecution has heavily 
relied upon the statement of Muhammad Asif recorded by the Investigating 
Officer Muhammad Nawaz SI (PW-18) in injured condition when he was 
admitted in Ganga Ram Hospital, Lahore, after having procured requisite 
permission from the concerned Medical Officer by filing application (Ex-

 
8 
Murder Reference No.319 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No.78701 of 2019 
Criminal Revision No.63816 of 2019 
PN), who declared that patient Muhammad Asif was fit for statement, on 
which his statement (Ex-PN/1) was recorded by Muhammad Nawaz 
Investigating Officer (PW-18). We have observed that statement of 
Muhammad Asif was recorded in terms of section 161 Cr.P.C. and there is 
no dispute qua the legal proposition that the statement in shape of dying 
declaration of a deceased is relevant and admissible under Article 46(1) of 
Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (Order) and Rule 25.21 of Chapter XXV 
of Police Rules, 1934 (Rules). The mechanism of the same has been 
provided in Article 46(1) of the Order, which reads as under;-  
“46. ………. 
(1) When it relates to cause of death: When the statement is made by a 
person as to the cause of his death, or as to any of the circumstances of the 
transaction which resulted in his death, in cases in which the cause of that 
person's death comes into question such statements are relevant whether the 
person who made them was or was not, at the time when they were made, 
under expectation of death, and whatever may be the nature of the 
proceeding in which cause of his death comes into question.” 
However, on going through the above referred provisions of law, it is 
obvious that statement of the deceased in the shape of dying declaration 
has been made relevant but the mechanism of recording the same has not 
been followed as provided in the above referred Rule 25.21 of the Rules, 
which reads as under;- 
“25-21.  Dying declaration— 
(1)  
A dying declaration shall, whenever possible, be recorded by a 
 
magistrate. 
(2)  
The person making the declaration shall, if possible, be examined by 
a medical officer with a view to ascertaining that he is sufficiently in 
possession of his reason to make a lucid statement. 
(3)      If no magistrate can be obtained, the  declaration 
shall, 
when 
a 
 
gazetted police officer is not present, be recorded in the presence 
 
of two or more reliable witnesses unconnected with the police 
 
department and with the parties concerned in the case. 
(4)      If no such witnesses can be obtained, without risk of the injured 
 
person dying before his statement can be recorded, it shall be 
 
recorded in the presence of two or more police officers. 
(5)      A dying declaration made to a police officer should, under section 
 
162, Code Criminal Procedure, be signed by the person making 
 
it.” 
So, there is no denial of the fact that the Investigating Officer (PW-18), 
while recording statement of Muhammad Asif (deceased) in injured 
condition had not adhered to the mandatory provisions of law as the word 
‘shall’ is used in each of the above referred Rule 25.21 (i to v) of Rules. 

 
9 
Murder Reference No.319 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No.78701 of 2019 
Criminal Revision No.63816 of 2019 
There is no cavil with the legal proposition that conviction can be based on 
the dying declaration alone. Reliance in this regard is placed upon the 
judgment passed by the august Supreme Court of Azad Jammu & Kashmir 
in case of “MISRI v. STATE through Advocate General” (1999 P.Cr.L.J 
116). However, for making reliance on this piece of evidence, the superior 
judiciary of the country had enumerated certain conditions to be fulfilled to 
make it trustworthy and reliable. The August Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
case of “Mst. ZAHIDA BIBI v. THE STATE” (PLD 2006 SC 255) had 
authoritatively held, if such statement was recorded in hospital, it should 
be written in presence of a Doctor or any other staff of hospital should be 
associated. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in above referred case 
observed as under;- 
“This is an admitted fact that the statement of the deceased was not 
recorded by the Sub-Inspector of police in presence of the doctor and 
further neither any member of hospital staff was associated at the time of 
recording the statement nor it was got verified by any official of the hospital 
that the statement was actually made by the deceased. Be that as it may, 
status of such statement would be hardly a statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C. and 
not a dying declaration of the deceased.”  
 
The purpose of statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C. recorded by the Investigating 
Officer during the course of investigation is only one, in our Criminal 
Administration of Justice, which has been provided u/s 162 Cr.P.C. and it 
read as under; 
“162. Statements to police not to be signed, use of such statements in 
evidence: (1) No statement made by any person to a police-officer in the 
course of an investigation under this Chapter shall if reduced into writing 
be signed by the person making it; nor shall-any such statement or any 
record thereof whether in a police-diary or otherwise or any part of such 
statement or record, be used for any purpose (save as hereinafter provided) 
at any inquiry or trial in respect of any offence under investigation at the 
time when such statement was made:  
Provided that, when any witness is called for the prosecution in such inquiry 
or trial whose statement has been reduced into writing as aforesaid the 
Court shall on the request of the accused, refer to such writing and direct 
that the accused be furnished with a copy thereof, in order that any part of 
such statement, if duly proved, may be used to contradict such witness in the 
manner provided by Section 145 of the Evidence Act, 1872. When any part 
of such statement is so used, any part thereof may also be used in the re-
examination of such witness, but for the purpose only of explaining any 
matter referred to in his cross examination:” 
(Underline has been provided for emphasis)  
Meaning thereby that the purpose of statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C. is to 
contradict and confront the witnesses in the manner as provided u/s 140 of 

 
10 
Murder Reference No.319 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No.78701 of 2019 
Criminal Revision No.63816 of 2019 
Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. So, in these circumstances, statement of 
Muhammad Asif deceased recorded by the Investigating Officer in injured 
condition in hospital u/s 161 Cr.P.C., carries no legal sanctity, rather it 
should not have been exhibited on record as (Ex-PN/1), however, this is 
the prerogative of accused only to bring it on record for the purpose of to 
contradict and confront the maker as observed above.  
13. 
The next piece of evidence is the medical evidence and as observed 
earlier, there is clear contradiction between ocular account and the medical 
evidence qua the injuries at the person of one of the deceased Mst. Rafia 
Rani, so, it hardly provides any support to the ocular account. Even 
otherwise, now it has been firmly settled by the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan that the medical evidence does not provide any corroboration to 
the ocular account, rather it just confirms the nature and seat of injuries, 
the weapon used therein and the time elapsed between injuries & death and 
death & postmortem. Reliance in this regard may be placed on the 
judgment passed by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in case of 
“MHAMMAD SALEEM v. SHABBIR AHMED and others” (2016 SCMR 
1605). 
14. 
So far as the motive part of the incident is concerned, the 
prosecution’s own case was that there was some family dispute between 
the appellant and his wife Mst. Rafia Rani, so, except oral assertion of the 
complainant, no other material/evidence is available on record to prove this 
aspect of the case. Even otherwise, it is hard to believe that on this trivial 
dispute, one can murder three innocent persons. 
15. 
Adverting to the evidence of recovery of weapon of offence i.e. 
.7mm rifle, from the possession of the appellant is concerned, according to 
record, Investigating Officer Muhammad Nawaz (PW-18) secured five 
crime empties of .7 mm from the crime scene and after arrest of the 
appellant, he allegedly got recovered rifle .7mm from his possession, both 
i.e. crime empties and rifle .7mm were sent for forensic analyses and vide 
report furnished by the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (Ex-PGG), the 
same were fond matched with each other. On going through memo of 

 
11 
Murder Reference No.319 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No.78701 of 2019 
Criminal Revision No.63816 of 2019 
possession of rifle .7mm (Ex-PD), it is observed that the appellant got 
recovered it from a room of his residential house, which was kept open in a 
corner of the room and in the said memo, it was never claimed that the said 
room was locked or the weapon was lying in a secret place. Meaning 
thereby that the weapon of offence was recovered from an open place, 
which according to the scaled site plan (Ex-PA), is the upper story of a 
Madrassa Zainab Bint-e-Ali and that place was accessible to the other 
people too. It means that the weapon of offence was not got recovered 
from the exclusive possession of the appellant. Even otherwise, there is no 
denial of the fact that the empties were recovered on the very first day of 
the occurrence i.e. 01.12.2012, whereas the appellant was arrested on 
02.12.2012 and the recovery of weapon of offence was got effected from 
his possession on 12.12.2012, whereas the same (empties) were sent to the 
Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) on 13.12.2012, which date is 
obviously after the arrest of the appellant, so, there is force in the 
assertions of learned counsel for the appellant that in these circumstances, 
this piece of evidence i.e. recovery of weapon of offence) rendered 
inconsequential and does not provide any corroboration to the ocular 
account.            
16. 
We have also adverted to the to the stance taken by the appellant 
during the course of investigation and before the learned trial Court while 
recording statement u/s 342 Cr.P.C., wherein he stated that in fact he had 
contracted marriage with Mst. Rafia Rani sister of the complainant against 
the wishes of her family, so, her brothers i.e. the complainant Ghulam Raza 
and Muhammad Asif deceased turned inimical towards him and in fact 
Muhammad Asif deceased was the actual culprit in this case, who 
murdered his mother Mst. Zohra Bibi and sister Mst. Rafia Rani (wife of 
the appellant) and when he (appellant) reached at the spot after hearing the 
voice of firing from Madrassa Zainab Bint-e-Ali and tried to snatch the gun 
from Muhammad Asif, at this moment he received fire arm injury by his 
own hands. The appellant further stated that he was empty handed and has 
no concern with the alleged offence. In his defence, the appellant produced 
two witnesses, namely, Muhammad Ramzan (DW-1) and Muhammad 

 
12 
Murder Reference No.319 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No.78701 of 2019 
Criminal Revision No.63816 of 2019 
Ameer (DW-2), we have gone through their testimonies and noticed that 
basically, both of them have tried to depose that in fact Rana Mazhar 
Hussain (PW-4), one of the eye witnesses, was not available at the crime, 
rather they alongwith the said Rana Mazhar Hussain got information about 
the incident in village Lakhiwal and thereafter, they proceeded towards the 
crime scene. However, we feel that there is no need to discuss the evidence 
adduced by the appellant, in his defence in detail, as we have already 
disbelieved the prosecution evidence as discussed in preceding paragraphs.      
17. 
In view of the above discussion, we reach to the conclusion that the 
presence of the eye witnesses at the crime scene is highly doubtful, the 
medical evidence is in conflict with ocular account and no other piece of 
evidence is available to rectify the inherent defects in the ocular account, 
hence, we hold that the prosecution remains failed to prove its case on the 
touchstone of principal of ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ hence, by giving 
benefit of doubt, we, allow the instant appeal and set aside the conviction 
and sentence awarded by the learned trial Court through impugned 
judgment to the appellant, Ghulam Abbas alias Agha and acquit him of the 
charge. He is in jail, so, he be released forthwith if not required to be 
detained in any other case. Resultantly, Murder Reference No.319 of 2019 
is answered in NEGATIVE and death sentence of the appellant is NOT 
CONFIRMED. 
18. 
So far as Criminal Revision No.63816 of 2019 filed by the 
complainant for enhancement of compensation amount awarded to the 
appellant is concerned, since we have already disbelieved the evidence of 
the prosecution and acquitted the appellant from the case, therefore, the 
revision petition filed by the complainant is dismissed being lost its 
relevance and becomes infructuous.
