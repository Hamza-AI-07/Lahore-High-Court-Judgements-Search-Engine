Writ Petition No.174 of 2022/BWP 
 
Muhammad Tariq 
Versus 
The Government of the Punjab through Secretary 
Finance, Lahore & others 
J U D G M E N T 
 
Date of hearing:     07.11.2023. 
Petitioner by: 
S.M. Areeb Abdul Khafid, Advocate.  
Respondents by: 
Rai Mazhar Hussain Kharal, Assistant Advocate 
General along with Mukhtar Ahmad, District 
Accounts Officer, Bahawalpur.  
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.: Through 
instant petition, petitioner has assailed vires of correspondence dated 
09.12.2019 & 20.01.2020, issued by respondents No.3 & 1, 
respectively, whereby deficiency in qualifying service of petitioner 
was not condoned and petitioner was disentitled for grant of pension.  
2. 
Learned counsel for petitioner submits that correct provision of 
the Punjab Civil Services Pension Rules (“the Pension Rules”) has 
not been applied to the petitioner’s case while declining his retirement 
claim, therefore, impugned letters refusing pensionary benefits of 
petitioner are unsustainable in the eye of law. In support, he has relied 
upon Muhammad Naeem Khan v. Government of Balochistan, Coastal 
Development and Fisheries Department, Civil Secretariat, Zarghoon 
Road, Quetta through Secretary and 2 others [2023 PLC (C.S.) Note 
58], Shahab Saqib through Attorney v. Sadaf Rasheed and 2 others 
(PLD 2023 Islamabad 34) and Basharat Ali v. The State and another 
(2023 MLD 60).  
3. 
Contrarily, learned Law Officer defends the impugned actions.

W.P. No.174 of 2022 / BWP 
4. 
I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the parties 
and perused the available record.  
5. 
Record shows that petitioner was dismissed from service vide 
order dated 04.09.2009, however, in appeal, learned Punjab Service 
Tribunal, Lahore vide order dated 19.12.2018, converted the penalty 
of dismissal from service into compulsory retirement w.e.f. 
04.09.2009. Petitioner was appointed as Junior Clerk on 17.01.1990, 
so his total service uptill compulsory retirement becomes 19-years, 
07-months & 18-days. However, petitioner’s case for grant of retiring 
pension was declined by the respondent-authorities on the ground that 
deficiency in qualifying service could not be condoned in case of 
compulsory retirement. It is pertinent to mention here that under Rule 
3.1 of the Pension Rules, pensions are classified into four categories 
catering for different situations and circumstances. The said classes 
are as under:   
(a)  
Compensation Pension  
(b)  
Invalid Pension  
(c)  
Superannuation Pension  
(d)  
Retiring Pension 
 
The case of petitioner falls in the category (d) i.e. Retiring Pension, 
which is dealt with under Rule 3.5. At this juncture, it would be 
beneficial to reproduce Rule 3.5 of the Pension Rules, which is as 
under:- 
“3.5  
Retiring Pension. – A retiring pension is granted to 
a Government servant, who not being eligible for 
superannuation pension- 
…..  
(ii)  
is compulsorily retired from service by the authority 
competent to remove him from service on grounds of 
inefficiency, misconduct or corruption.” 
 
The above Rule does not prescribe any minimum or maximum 
length of service for grant of retiring pension. Furthermore, Rule 
2.12(2)(a) of the Pension Rules provides that a deficiency of 06-

3 
W.P. No.174 of 2022 / BWP 
months or less in qualifying service of a government servant shall be 
deemed to have been condoned. The said relevant portion is 
reproduced as under:  
“2.12 Condonation of interruptions and deficiencies. – 
(1) ….. 
(2) (a) A deficiency of six months or less in the qualifying 
service of a Government servant shall be deemed to have 
been condoned. 
…..” 
In this view of the matter, petitioner reaches the threshold of twenty 
years of qualifying service for pension or other retiring benefits within 
the contemplation of Section 12 of the Punjab Civil Servants Act, 
1974.  
 
Needless to say that compulsory retirement differs from 
dismissal or removal from service as it does not stipulate penal 
consequences inasmuch as a person retired compulsorily is entitled to 
pension and other retiral benefits proportionate to the period of service 
standing to his credit. Reference can be made to Abdul Ghani v. 
Hon’ble Chief Justice through Registrar High Court [2023 PLC 
(C.S.) Note 43]. 
6. 
Ex facie the orders / correspondence impugned through instant 
petition do not have any legal basis as it is well-established that the 
administrative officials are not vested with any constitutional or legal 
authority to interpret, extend, curtail, modify, add or subtract a 
provision of law. Interpretation of law is purely and exclusively a 
judicial function under the scheme of trichotomy of power enshrined 
in the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (“the 
Constitution”) and jurisprudentially entrenched in our legal system 
through consistent and exhaustive pronouncements of the Apex Court 
in this regard. Reliance is placed upon The Province of Punjab 
through Secretary Finance Department, Government of the Punjab, 
Lahore and others v. Kanwal Rashid and others (2021 SCMR 730) 
and Muhammad Faheem Zafar v. Government of the Punjab through 
Accountant General, Punjab and 3 others [2022 PLC (C.S.) 1156]. 
Therefore, in attending circumstances, clarification Notification issued 

4 
W.P. No.174 of 2022 / BWP 
by the Finance Department, Government of the Punjab has no lawful 
basis and impugned letters do not appear to have been issued in 
accordance with law, thus, same are unsustainable.  
7. 
In view of the above, instant petition is allowed in the manner 
that impugned letters are set aside being illegal and without lawful 
authority. Respondent No.3 is directed to proceed in the matter and 
finalize the case of petitioner within a fortnight, keeping in view the 
dictum of law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Haji 
Muhammad Ismail Memon, Advocate (PLD 2007 Supreme Court 
35).
