Date of Hearing 
29.05.2023 
Petitioner By: 
Mr. A.W. Chaddha, Advocate. 
Respondent 
No.1 By: 
Mr. S.M. Zeeshan Mirza, Advocate 
 
Anwaar Hussain J: The petitioner has laid challenge to the 
orders dated 12.04.2021 and 21.05.2021 passed by respondent No.3 
(“the Rent Tribunal”) and respondent No.2 (“the Appellate Court”) 
respectively. By virtue of the former order, ejectment of the petitioner 
from the rented premises fully described in the eviction petition has 
been ordered; whereas through the latter, the order dated 12.04.2021 
has been upheld.   
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that on the one hand, 
the Rent Tribunal, vide order dated 12.04.2021, partially accepted the 
petitioner‟s application for leave to contest the eviction petition, filed 
by respondent No.1 („the respondent‟), and framed Issue No.1 with 
regard to the default; and on the other hand, the Rent Tribunal 
partially accepted the eviction petition on the ground of default that is 
self-contradictory and this aspect has escaped the notice of the 
Appellate Court below as well. He further submits that once the issue 
with regard to default had been framed, ejectment of the petitioner 
could not have been ordered without recording of evidence and the 
determination of the issue framed to this effect. Further avers that the 
learned fora below have applied Section 20 of the Punjab Rented 
Premises Act, 2009 (“the Act”) while reaching the  conclusion that 

 
 
2 
W.P No.36692/2021 
the petitioner is admittedly a defaulter in respect of the rent for the 
month of September, 2020 whereas in-fact the applicable provision of 
the Act is Section 24, inasmuch as once an eviction petition is filed 
and the parties are before the Rent Tribunal, the rent is to be 
determined and paid as per the direction of the Rent Tribunal, if there 
is dispute regarding the amount of rent, which is precisely the 
situation in the present case.    
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent supports the 
impugned orders and submits that Section 7 of the Act contemplates 
that in case a landlord refuses to receive the rent, it is obligatory on 
part of the tenant (the petitioner) to either tender the same through 
money order or approach the Rent Tribunal by way of filing an 
application for deposit of the rent and in the instant case, such an 
application has not been made, at least for the deposit of rent for the 
month of September, 2020 as per the contents of the leave to contest 
filed by the petitioner, therefore, both the Courts below have correctly 
rendered the impugned findings. 
4. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
5. 
The relationship of landlord and tenant is admitted between the 
parties. It is the case of the petitioner that the tenancy commenced in 
the year 2018 for a period of 10 years and the monthly rent was settled 
as Rs.12,000/-, which due to agreed annual increment was Rs.13,200/- 
per month in the month of September, 2020, however, the respondent, 
with malafide intention, filed the eviction petition in July, 2020 on the 
basis of a forged tenancy agreement purportedly executed in the year 
2019 and also kept on receiving the rent @ Rs.13,200/- but refused to 
issue receipt for the month of September, 2020 and when the 
petitioner appeared before the Rent Tribunal, after publication of 
notice issued to effect the service of the petitioner in the eviction 
petition, the petitioner filed  leave to contest on the date fixed and 
volunteered to deposit the monthly rent as per direction of the Rent 
Tribunal. On the other hand, it is the case of the respondent that the 

 
 
3 
W.P No.36692/2021 
tenancy between the parties commenced in the year 2019, for a period 
of one year only against payment of monthly rent @ Rs.44,000/- and 
the petitioner is defaulter since April, 2020. The Rent Tribunal 
partially allowed the leave to contest to determine whether the 
petitioner is entitled to receive the amount of security under the 
agreement, which the petitioner relied upon and whether the said 
agreement is valid for a period of 10 years, however, the leave was 
partly refused on the ground that the petitioner has admittedly not paid 
the rent for the month of September, 2020 and, hence, liable to be 
evicted on the basis of admitted default in the light of Section 20 of 
the Act, whereas the petitioner side contends that applicable provision 
of Act is Section 24. Therefore, the question that requires 
determination from this Court is articulated as under: 
 What is the true import of Sections 7, 20 and 24 
of the Act and whether the petitioner’s leave has 
been rightly refused, by correct application of 
law, while treating him as a defaulter?  
 
6. 
Before examining the legality of the impugned orders whereby 
application of the petitioner for leave to contest was partially declined 
and answering the legal question formulated hereinabove, it will be 
appropriate to reproduce the operative part of the impugned order 
passed by the Rent Tribunal that reads as under: 
“5. Perusal of record reflects that the parties are at 
variance regarding the execution of different rent 
agreements. The ejectment petitioner has relied his 
stance on rent agreement dated 03.09.2019 and the 
applicant/respondent has relied his stance on rent 
agreement dated 01.11.2018. It is observed that both 
these agreements are not registered……….. It is 
observed that the ejectment petitioner has claimed 
default in payment of rent with the contentions that the 
respondent has failed to pay the rent of demised 
premises from the month of April, 2020……It is also 
important to note here that the applicant/respondent in 
parawise reply No.2 (on merits) of his leave to contest 
contended that he has paid the monthly rent till August, 
2020 and contended that the ejectment petitioner with 
malafide intention prevaricated from receiving the 

 
 
4 
W.P No.36692/2021 
monthly rent of September, 2020 on one or other pretext 
just to achieve his ulterior motives and the respondent is 
ready to deposit the rent for the month of September, 
2020 and so on in this forum. If the ejectment petitioner 
has refused to receive the rent then under the law remedy 
was available to the respondent either to deposit or tender 
the rent as per section 20 of PRPA, 2009………and it is 
settled law that „when law prescribes a manner for doing 
of a particular thing that thing is to be done in the manner 
which is provided by law‟. Since the applicant/ 
respondent has not adopted the prescribed mode under 
the law for payment of rent in case of refusal of 
landlord to receive the rent. The applicant/respondent 
has failed to pay or tender any rent to the landlord 
through money order or deposit in the bank account or 
he has failed to file any application before rent tribunal. 
The applicant/respondent in parawise reply No.2 (on 
merits) of his leave to contest himself admitted that he 
has not paid the rent from September, 2020 and onwards. 
Admittedly, the applicant/respondent is in possession of 
demised premises as tenant. If applicant/respondent has 
admitted his status as tenant on the basis of rent 
agreement dated 01.11.2018 then he should approach to 
the rent tribunal for grant of permission to deposit the 
rent on the basis of agreement dated 01.11.2018 (relied 
by the applicant/respondent) but he has failed to do so. 
Hence, this tribunal has no hesitation to hold him a 
defaulter in payment of rent. Hence, default on part of 
the applicant/respondent is also proved which is also a 
statutory ground for eviction of tenant provided u/s 15 (b) 
of PRPA, 2009.” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
7. 
The payment of the rent and what constitutes default thereof, 
under the law, is governed and determined by a conjunctive 
application of not only Sections 7, 20 and 24 of the Act but also 
Section 15 thereof. Section 7 reads as under: 
“7. Payment of rent.– (1) A tenant shall pay or tender 
the rent to the landlord in the mode and by the date 
mentioned in the tenancy agreement. 
(2)  If the date of payment is not mentioned in the 
tenancy agreement, a tenant shall pay or tender the rent 
not later than tenth day of the following month. 
(3)  If the mode of payment is not mentioned in the 
tenancy agreement, a tenant shall pay or tender the rent to 

 
 
5 
W.P No.36692/2021 
the landlord through money order or deposit in the bank 
account of the landlord.” 
 
Whereas Section 20 of the Act reads as under: 
“20. Application 
for 
deposit 
of 
rent.– 
(1) 
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, if a 
landlord refuses to accept the rent, the tenant may file 
an application in the Rent Tribunal for deposit of the 
rent. 
(2)  The Rent Tribunal shall, without prejudice to the 
rights of the landlord, allow the tenant to deposit the rent 
for the period for which the landlord has refused to 
receive the rent. 
(3)  The Rent Tribunal shall inform the landlord of the 
deposit of rent by the tenant and may pass an order 
permitting the landlord to collect the same.” 
 
  (Emphasis supplied) 
Section 7 of the Act merely states that a tenant shall pay or tender rent 
in accordance with mode and date recorded in the tenancy agreement 
and if no date and/or manner has been mentioned in the tenancy 
agreement, the tenant shall follow the date and mode prescribed under 
Section 7 i.e., pay or tender rent not later than 10th day of the 
following month and the rent shall be paid through money order or 
deposit in the bank account. In the instant case, the tenancy agreement 
dated 03.09.2019 relied upon by the respondent depicts that the rent 
was to be paid between 1st to 5th of every month in advance. There is 
no mention of the bank account of the respondent in the said 
agreement. So even if the said agreement is taken as a genuine 
document to have been executed between the parties governing their 
relationship as landlord and tenant, the obligation of the petitioner to 
pay the rent was by 5th of every month and in case the respondent had 
refused to receive the same and issue receipt accordingly, the 
petitioner as tenant was obligated to tender the same through money 
order or deposit in the bank account of the respondent. In the instant 
case, since the agreement does not provide the details of the bank of 
the respondent, tender could have been made through the money order 

 
 
6 
W.P No.36692/2021 
only. Section 7 is to be then read with Section 15 of the Act to 
determine as to the time limit available, under the law, to a tenant (the 
petitioner) to tender the rent upon refusal of the landlord (the 
respondent), through money order or by filing an application in the 
Rent Tribunal, failing which the tenant becomes a defaulter. Section 
15 envisages the grounds for eviction that also includes default as one 
of the grounds of eviction. The said provision reads as under:  
 
“15.  Grounds for eviction.–  
      
(a)  ……. 
(b)  the tenant has failed to pay or tender the rent, within a 
period of thirty days after the expiry of the period 
stipulated in section 7;” 
 
   (Emphasis supplied) 
 
The averments of the petitioner that he has not paid the rent for the 
month of September, 2020 and non-filing of the application with the 
Rent Tribunal for deposit of rent has been treated as an admission of 
default is not justified when conjunctive reading of Section 7 with 
Section 15(b) is made while keeping in view the agreement dated 
03.09.2019 upon which the respondent himself has relied. A period of 
thirty days with effect from 5th of every month was available to the 
petitioner to tender the rent. Rent for September, 2020 was due by 05th 
of the said month and when read with Section 15(b), the petitioner had 
a period of further thirty days that extends to 05.10.2020. The 
petitioner first appeared before the Rent Tribunal, on 29.09.2020, well 
within the period available to the petitioner in terms of Section 15(b) 
of the Act and he could have filed the application in terms of said 
provision till 05.10.2020. However, after obtaining knowledge of 
pendency of the eviction petition, as also the grounds of eviction and 
the assertion of default in terms of agreement dated 03.09.2019, the 
petitioner was not obligated to send any money order or file a separate 
application for deposit of rent for the month of September, 2020 
before 05.10.2020 as the Rent Tribunal, on 29.09.2020, adjourned the 
case for 09.10.2020. It is admitted feature of the case that on 

 
 
7 
W.P No.36692/2021 
09.10.2020, the petitioner filed leave to contest in which a categorical 
challenge was laid to the veracity of the tenancy agreement relied 
upon by the respondent, so also about the rate of rent with the 
willingness to deposit the amount of rent for the month of September, 
2020 as per direction of the Rent Tribunal. The parties were before the 
Rent Tribunal in the month of September, 2020 in respect of which 
the statement of petitioner regarding non-payment of rent has been 
treated as admitted default and made basis of the eviction ignoring the 
fact that Section 24 of the Act immediately comes into play in such 
situation that reads as under: 
“24.  
Payment of rent and other dues pending 
proceedings.– (1) If an eviction application is filed, the 
Rent Tribunal, while granting leave to contest, shall direct 
the tenant to deposit the rent due from him within a 
specified time and continue to deposit the same in 
accordance with the tenancy agreement or as may be 
directed by the Rent Tribunal in the bank account of the 
landlord or in the Rent Tribunal till the final order. 
(2)  If there is a dispute as to the amount of rent due or rate 
of rent, the Rent Tribunal shall tentatively determine the 
dispute and pass the order for deposit of the rent in terms of 
sub-section (1). 
(3)  In case the tenant has not paid a utility bill, the Rent 
Tribunal shall direct the tenant to pay the utility bill. 
(4)  If a tenant fails to comply with a direction or order of the 
Rent Tribunal, the Rent Tribunal shall forthwith pass the final 
order.” 
  (Emphasis supplied) 
 
It is the mandate of law in terms of Section 24 of the Act that if 
eviction petition is filed, it is the Rent Tribunal which, while granting 
leave to contest, shall direct the tenant to deposit the rent due from 
him, within the specified time, more particularly when the parties are 
at variance as to the rate of the monthly rent. Certainly, there is no 
gainsaying that the petitioner had appeared before the Rent Tribunal 
on 29.09.2020 and the matter was adjourned to 09.10.2020 when the 
petitioner volunteered to pay the rent as per the direction of the Rent 
Tribunal, in terms of Section 24 of the Act, that shows bona-fides on 

 
 
8 
W.P No.36692/2021 
part of the petitioner. Had the tenant not appeared before the Rent 
Tribunal prior to lapse of time triggering default in terms of 
conjunctive reading of Section 7 read with Section 15(b) of the Act, 
the situation would have been different and he could have been said to 
have defaulted as this would have meant that he either did not appear 
before the Rent Tribunal, consciously, to avoid payment of rent or 
would have not been in knowledge of the filing of the eviction 
petition; therefore, he was obligated to tender rent in accordance with 
Section 7 read with Sections15 and 20 of the Act. However, this is not 
the situation in the instant case as the petitioner had appeared before 
the Rent Tribunal prior to the lapse of time triggering default and the 
applicability of Section 20 subsided to give way to Section 24 of the 
Act. 
8. 
The interplay of Section 24 with reference to Section 20 also 
came for adjudication before this Court in case reported as “Mst. 
Rehana Fayyaz v. 1. Rent Tribunal/Civil Judge 1st Class, Rahim Yar 
Khan, 2. Muhammad Iqbal” (2015 CLJ 732) and it was held that a 
plain reading of Section 20 shows that it was enacted to provide for 
meeting a specific situation that might arise in the event of a 
landlord‟s refusal to receive the rent from the tenant and should this 
happen, the tenant would be able to approach the Rent Tribunal 
seeking permission to deposit the rent due from him so as to 
circumvent an attempt on part of a clever landlord who might refuse 
to receive rent from the tenant and then institute an eviction petition 
on the ground that the tenant had committed willful default in the 
payment of the rent whereas Section 24 comes into play after the 
filing of an eviction petition. This Court is of the opinion that the 
scope, purview and object of Sections 20 and 24 of the Act are quite 
distinct, and they are intended to achieve two different objectives and 
one provision cannot be interpreted in a manner so as to defeat the 
object and purpose of the other. The legislature has deliberately and 
consciously incorporated the said two provisions with distinct object 

 
 
9 
W.P No.36692/2021 
with regard to default. Therefore, the default prior to filing of eviction 
petition and subsequent to the filing of eviction petition has to be 
viewed through the prisms of Section 20 and 24 respectively and both 
the Courts below have erred by not appreciating this distinction. 
9. 
The matter can be examined from another angle. Had there 
been default by the petitioner prior to filing of the eviction petition in 
such an unambiguous manner as not to require recording of any 
evidence, the Rent Tribunal would have been justified in passing the 
order of eviction straightaway; however, when the Rent Tribunal itself 
came to the conclusion that there are two tenancy agreements and 
veracity thereof is yet to be determined that requires recording of 
evidence and the issue as to default prior to filing of eviction has been 
also framed, the default in post-filing of eviction petition becomes 
relevant only if it is made subsequent to the direction issued by the 
Rent Tribunal under Section 24 of the Act that amply caters for the 
right of the landlord to receive rent during the pendency of the 
eviction petition. 
10. 
In view of what has been discussed above, the instant petition is 
allowed and the impugned orders are set aside. As a consequence, the 
Rent Tribunal may pass an appropriate order in terms of Section 24 of 
the Act directing the petitioner to pay rent, till the final adjudication of 
the eviction petition, at the rate and manner to be determined by the 
Rent Tribunal, in accordance with law.
