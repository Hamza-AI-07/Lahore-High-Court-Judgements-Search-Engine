Petitioner by 
Raja Sikandar Khan, Advocate. 
Respondent  by 
 
M/S Barrister Muhammad Abubakar, Ch. 
M. Waseem Akram and Malik Nadir Ali 
Sherazi, Advocates. 
 
Abid Aziz Sheikh, J.-  This judgment will also decide ITR 
No.56083/2022, ITR No.56086/2022 and ITR No.56088/2022, as 
all these reference applications are against the same impugned 
order dated 05.4.2022 (impugned order) in respect of different 
tax years passed by Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue 
(Tribunal). 
2. 
These reference applications are filed under section 133 
of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (Ordinance) against 
impugned order passed by the Tribunal in respect of tax years 
2017 to 2020. Though number of questions of law are framed in 

ITR No.56081 of 2022 
 
 
2
these reference applications, however, the following questions 
of law have been pressed and argued:- 
1. Whether in the facts and circumstances of the 
case the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue 
made a gross error in holding that profit on debt 
on deposit of surplus funds in banks was income 
from business under sub-section (2) Section 18 
of 
the 
Income 
Tax 
Ordinance, 
2001 
notwithstanding the fact that it is not the 
respondent taxpayer’s business to derive such 
income as the respondent taxpayer is not a 
banking company or a financial institution or a 
lending company or an investment company or 
registered as such with the Securities & 
Exchange Commission of Pakistan or State 
Bank of Pakistan?. 
 
2. Whether the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue 
made a gross error in reading sub-section (5) of 
section 25 by holding that only the cost of 
feasibility studies, construction of proto types and 
trial production activities were included in pre-
commencement 
expenditure 
whereas 
pre-
commencement expenditure also means any 
expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively to 
derive income chargeable to tax?. 
 
3. Whether in the facts and circumstances of the 
case the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue made 
a gross error to allow deduction of pre-
commencement expenses from profit on debt 
which is income from other sources, whereas 
under section 25 of the Ordinance, 2001 pre-
commencement expenses could only be allowed as 
amortization on a straight line basis at the rate 
specified in Part III of the Third Schedule?.  
3. 
Relevant facts are that respondent is a company deriving 
income from air transport services.  Returns of incomes filed for 
tax years 2017 to 2020 were treated as deemed assessment orders 

ITR No.56081 of 2022 
 
 
3
in terms of section 120(1) of the Ordinance. Later on, Additional 
Commissioner Inland Revenue (ADCIR) initiated proceeding 
under section 122(5A) of the Ordinance and passed order on 
07.4.2021. The respondent being aggrieved filed appeal before 
Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) (CIR-A) which 
confirmed the order of ADCIR on 13.7.2021. The respondent 
being aggrieved filed appeal before the Tribunal, which was 
partially allowed through impugned order, hence these reference 
applications.  
4. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner department submits that 
expense incurred for deriving income chargeable to tax for the 
tax year 2017 to 2020 were pre-commencement expenses and 
therefore, lawfully disallowed and amortized by the ADCIR and 
CIR-A. Further submits that income on account of profit on debt 
was not income from business as provided under section 18(2) of 
the Ordinance rather the same was income from the other source 
under section 39(1)(c) of the Ordinance.  
5. 
Learned counsel for the respondent assessee on the other 
hand supported the impugned order.  
6. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. The first question 
require determination in this case is that whether income on 

ITR No.56081 of 2022 
 
 
4
account of profit on debt was to be treated as income from 
business under section 18(2) of the Ordinance or it is income 
from other sources under section 39(1)(c) of the Ordinance. For 
convenience, Section 39(1) and section 18(1) and (2) of the 
Ordinance are reproduced hereunder:- 
39.Income from other sources.---(1) Income 
of every kind received by a person in a tax 
year, [if it is not included in any other 
head,] 
18.Income 
from 
business.---(1) 
The 
following incomes of a person for a tax year, 
other than income exempt from tax under 
this Ordinance, shall be chargeable to tax 
under the head “income from Business”. 
(2) Any profit on debt derived by a person 
where the person’s business is to derive such 
income shall be chargeable to tax under the 
head “income from Business” and not under 
the head “Income from Other Sources”. 
7. 
Plain reading of Section 18(2) of the Ordinance shows that 
any profit on debt derived by a person where the person business 
is to derive such income, shall be chargeable to tax under the 
head “income from Business and not under the head income from 
other sources”. Whereas under Section 39(1) of the Ordinance 
income of every kind received by a person in a tax year if not 

ITR No.56081 of 2022 
 
 
5
included in any other head shall be income from other sources. In 
the present case, facts are not disputed that respondent is a 
company established to carry on and operate air transport 
services as also mentioned in objects of the company under its 
Memorandum of Association (MOA). In order to achieve 
objects, the respondent company is also authorized to invest 
surplus money of the company in shares, stocks or securities etc.  
8. 
For ready reference, the relevant objects for which the 
respondent company is established are all or any of the 
following.  
1. To carry on and operate air-transport services or any 
means of transportation by aircrafts, helicopters, air taxi 
services, buses, railroad, wagons, coaches or ships and 
transport by air craft of passenger, goods of all kinds and 
cargo for commercial or other purposes and to carry out 
all forms of aerial work. To establish airlines for the 
purpose of transport of passengers and cargo of all 
descriptions and to provide air charters and such others 
services as may be incidental to or conveniently 
combined with other business or airlines on domestic as 
well as international route, subject to necessary 
remissions required from concerned authorities.

For the purpose of achieving the above objects, the 
company is authorized:- 
To invest surplus money of the Company in shares, stocks 
or securities of any company, debentures, debenture stocks 
or in any investments, short term and long term 
participation, term finance certificates or any other 
government or semi-government securities in such manner 
as may from time to time be decided by the directors, 
without indulging non-banking finance business, banking 
or an investment company or any such business. 
 
 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
9. 
Admittedly, the primary object and purpose of respondent 
company is to carry on and operate air transport service and not 
to derive any profit on debt as required under Section 18(2) of the 
Ordinance. No doubt, for the purpose to achieve said object the 
respondent company was authorized to invest surplus money of 

ITR No.56081 of 2022 
 
 
7
the company in shares, stocks or securities of any company, 
debentures, debenture stocks or in any investments, short term 
and long term participation, term finance certificates or any other 
government or semi-government securities but respondent 
company is specifically not allowed to indulge in non-banking 
finance business, banking or an investment company or any such 
business. The respondent company was incorporated on 
06.06.2016 though certificate of commencement of business was 
issued on 26.08.2016, however, admittedly, date of actual 
commencement of business is 20.12.2020 when first sales tax 
return was filed, hence, the profit in question accrued on surplus 
money from 2017 to 2020, is before the commencement of 
respondent company business. 
10. 
The similar matter came up before Supreme Court in 
Lucky Cement Ltd vs. Commissioner Income Tax, Zone 
Companies Circle, Peshawar (2015 PTD 2210). In the said case, 
the legal question was that whether income received by Lucky 
Cement Limited (Lucky Cement) from the investment made by 
it of its surplus money, into various profitable schemes/banks can 
be treated as income from business or income from other source. 
The argument of Lucky Cement counsel was that though the 
primary object and purpose of the company was to establish 

ITR No.56081 of 2022 
 
 
8
Cement Factory and this would be ultimate business of Lucky 
Cement, however, since the MOA of the Lucky Cement permits 
investment to be made for the purpose of its business to generate 
income, therefore, any profit earned or income generated/ 
received from such investment should be taxed as income from 
business, as opposed to income from other sources. Out of three 
Hon’ble Judges of Bench, one Judge Mian Saqib Nisar, J. agreed 
with the above argument and held that amount of profit earned by 
Lucky Cement from the investment made in various 
schemes/banks cannot be termed to have been accrued from any 
other source but it is a business income. However, other two 
Hon’ble Judges Sh. Azmat Saeed, and Mushir Alam, JJ. gave a 
dissenting note and held that surplus fund investment does not 
amount to Business income rather same fall under the head 
“income from other sources” under clause (f) of section 15 of the 
Income Tax Ordinance, 1979 (Ordinance of 1979). The 
operative part of the judgment by Hon’ble Mushir Alam, J. is 
reproduced hereunder:- 
“On examining the scheme of the Income Tax Ordinance, 
1979, case-law on the subject, consensus that emerges is 
that during the period or course of setting up of a factory 
or plant by the company, activity of investing surplus funds 
of the company and generating any sum, return or interest 
on such investment, could not be considered as “income 
from business” under clause (d) of section 15 of the 
Ordinance, 1979. Fact remains in the words of the 

ITR No.56081 of 2022 
 
 
9
appellant, surplus funds in the hands of appellant company 
were employed “in proactive manner in order to generate 
additional fund”, invested its surplus funds “by way of 
portfolio, fund and cash management venture”. It is 
appellant’s case that “by an active trading (buying and 
selling) of these financial assets, the appellant was able to 
earn substantial amount by way of return”. Such activity 
was carried out during the period cement plant/factory 
was under construction, therefore, the appellant, under 
facts and circumstances cannot be said to be carrying on 
any business within the contemplation of section 22 of the 
Ordinance, 1979. When income does not fit in any of the 
five sub-heads enumerated in clauses (a) to (e) of section 
15 of the Ordinance, 1979 and falls under the residuary 
sub-head of “Income from other sources” i.e. clause (f) of 
section 15 ibid, the DICT, under the given facts and 
circumstances, was justified to treat the “interest” income 
yielding from the investment of the surplus funds of the 
company as “Income from other sources” and rightly 
assessed the same under section 30(2)(b) of the Ordinance, 
1979, which was rightly sustained by the ITAT and so also 
by the learned Division Bench of the High Court”.     
 
11. 
Though the aforesaid judgment is based on the scheme of 
Ordinance of 1979, however, we have noticed that the relevant 
provision of the Ordinance for the given purposes has no bearing 
on the majority view by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in Lucky 
Cement’s case supra. In section 30 of the Ordinance of 1979, 
chargeable sources under the head “income from other sources” 
admitted interest, whereas, section 39 of the Ordinance provides 
that income of every kind received by a person in a tax year, if 
not included in any other head, other than exempted from the tax 
under the Ordinance, shall be chargeable to tax in that year under 
the head “income from other sources” includes “profit on debt”. 

ITR No.56081 of 2022 
 
 
10
Section 2(46)(a) of the Ordinance provides that “profit on debt” 
whether payable or receivable means any profit, yield, interest 
etc., therefore, for the present purposes majority view in Lucky 
Cement’s case supra is squarely applicable.    
12. 
The reported judgment of Islamabad High Court titled The 
Commissioner of Income Tax vs. Messrs Fauji Foundation (2021 
PTD 1951) referred in the impugned order is distinguishable. In 
said case, assesse was trust and the department from 1999 to 
2002 treated its interest income from bank deposits as income 
from business. Further in said case, this Court on 27.10.1999 in 
ITA No.16 to 20 of 1999 remanded the matter to Tribunal and 
after remand Tribunal decide the question against the department 
on 30.6.2000 treating interest income as business income but said 
order of Tribunal was not challenged further by the department, 
hence attained finality. The factual position of this case is 
altogether different from the above facts. No doubt, learned 
Islamabad High Court in said judgment held that Lucky Cement 
Limited case is not applicable because in MOA of Lucky Cement, 
there was specific prohibition against investment which is not 
available in the case of Messrs Fauji Foundation supra, however, 
in the present case respondent company by its MOA is also not 
allowed to indulge in investment-company or any such business. 

ITR No.56081 of 2022 
 
 
11
Indeed in Lucky Cement Ltd. case supra, one of the Hon’ble 
Judges (Sh. Azmat Saeed, J.) also observed that under non-
obstante clause 37 of MOA of Lucky Cement, there is prohibition 
to indulge in the business of investment, however, this was not 
the sole ground to treat the interest income of Lucky Cement as 
income from other source and not a business income. Though in 
the present case, there is no such specific non-obstante clause in 
MOA prohibiting business of banking, finance, investment, 
leasing and insurance, however, indulgent in investment 
company or any such business is specifically not allowed by 
MOA of respondent company. Further, there is no explicit or 
implied object clause in MOA of respondent company whereby 
any of such business activities is allowed. The respondent 
company is not a banking company or financial institution or 
lending company or an investment company or registered as such 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan 
(SECP) or State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), rather admittedly 
respondent company business is to carry and operate air transport 
service, hence, profit on deposit of its surplus, before 
commencement of its business cannot be treated as income from 
business under Section 18(2) of the Ordinance. In view of above, 
we have no manner of doubt that majority view laid down by 

ITR No.56081 of 2022 
 
 
12
Supreme Court in Lucky Cement Limited case supra is applicable 
to the present case. 
13. 
It is not out of place to note that in Lucky Cement Ltd 
case majority Hon’ble Judges specifically relied upon judgment 
reported as  Commissioner of Income Tax, East Pakistan Dacca 
vs. The liquidator Khulna Bagerhat Railway Company Limited, 
Ahmadabad (PLD 1962 SC 128) where it was held that interest 
income yielding from investment of surplus fund of the 
company is income from other source and not business income. 
The operative part of judgment from “Commissioner of Income 
Tax vs. Liquidator Khulna Bagerhat” supra is reproduced 
hereunder:- 
“We have considered the various Articles by which 
this Company was governed. We have no hesitation 
in agreeing with the view of the High Court that the 
normal business of the 
Company was the 
construction and the running of the Railway and not 
investment of its moneys on interest. Other powers 
were also given to the Company by the Articles of 
Association, but it is not contended that all those 
powers pertained to the earning of normal business 
income. If the Company, instead of retaining its 
surplus moneys in idle condition, invested them 
under the powers given to them by their Articles of 
Association, it would not follow that the income so 
derived would be part of the Company’s normal 
business income. Each case must be decided on its 
own facts and, in the instant case, the circumstances 
brought out in the evidence do not indicate that 

ITR No.56081 of 2022 
 
 
13
receiving of interest on invested moneys was really 
included in the business income of the Company”. 
14. 
The next question is that whether the management and 
administrative expense from year 2017 to 2020 does not come 
within the definition of pre-commencement expenditure as 
defined 25(5) of the Ordinance. For convenience, section 25(5) of 
the Ordinance is reproduced hereunder:- 
Section 
25(5).In 
this 
section, 
“pre-commencement 
expenditure” means any expenditure incurred before the 
commencement of a business wholly and exclusively to 
derive income chargeable to tax, including the cost of 
feasibility studies, construction of prototypes, and trial 
production activities, but shall not include any expenditure 
which is incurred in acquiring land, or which is 
depreciated or amortized under section 22 of 24. 
 
From plain reading of section 25(5) of the Ordinance, it is 
evident that pre-commencement expenditure 
means any 
expenditure incurred before the commencement of a business 
wholly and exclusively to derive income chargeable to tax, 
including the cost of feasibility studies, construction of 
prototypes, and trial production activities but shall not include 
any expenditure which is incurred in acquiring land, or which is 
depreciated or amortized under section 22 or 24 of the Ordinance.  
The word “including” in section 25(5) of the Ordinance 
established that the cost of feasibility studies, construction of 

ITR No.56081 of 2022 
 
 
14
prototypes, and trial production activities are not the only pre-
commencement expenditure rather the said term is wide enough 
to include any expenditure incurred before the commencement of 
the business wholly and exclusively to derive income chargeable 
to tax.  
15. 
The word “include” is normally used as an expression of 
enlargement and implies that something also falls within the 
word which was beyond its general organic meaning in the 
interpretation clauses in order to enlarge the meaning of the 
words or phrases occurring in the body of the statute. In one of 
the recent judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan in case 
titled “Qudrat Ullah vs. Additional District Judge, Renala Khurd 
District Okara and others : (PLD 2024 Supreme Court 581), 
following has been observed:- 
“…The word “includes” is generally used in interpretation 
clauses in order to enlarge the meaning of words or 
phrases, occurring in the body of the Statute; and when it 
is so used those words or phrases must be construed as 
comprehending, not only such things as they signify 
according to their natural import, but also those things 
which the interpretation clause declares that they shall 
include…”. 
It is also equally settled that this, however, is not rule of thumb 
and sometime word “include” conveys the restricted meaning. 
This depends upon the context in which the word “including” or 

ITR No.56081 of 2022 
 
 
15
“include” is used. As already has been observed, the word 
“including” in section 25(5) of the Ordinance is used in the 
middle of the sentence and when it is read in the context, does 
not leave any doubt that the same is not used in the restrictive 
meaning rather enlarging the scope of the said subsection. The 
narrow and restrictive meaning given by the Tribunal to “pre-
commencement expenditure” under Section 25(5) of the 
Ordinance is not supported by law and therefore, we are of the 
considered view that the expenses are covered under the head of 
pre-commencement expenses under section 25(5) of the 
Ordinance as lawfully held by ADCIR and CIR-A. 
16. 
So far as the question No.3 is concerned, as profit on 
surplus fund amount to income from other sources and expenses 
are covered under the head of pre-commencement expenses 
under section 25(5) of the Ordinance as discussed above, the 
assessing officer had lawfully disallowed and amortized expenses 
against interest income under the relevant provision of the 
Ordinance.  
17. 
In view of above discussion, questions are answered 
accordingly. Consequently, these reference applications are 
partially allowed and after setting aside the impugned order of 

ITR No.56081 of 2022 
 
 
16
the Tribunal, on the above two questions, the orders passed by 
ADCIR and CIR-A are upheld.  
18. 
Office shall send copy of this judgment under the seal of the 
Court to the learned Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue as per 
Section 133(5) of the Ordinance, 2001.
