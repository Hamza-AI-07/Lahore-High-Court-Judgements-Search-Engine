3. 
 
Precisely, the necessary facts of the case, as divulged through the 
statement of Nasrullah Khan,Naib Dafedar (PW-5),the complainant of the 
case ,are as under:- 
“Stated that on 09.12.2020, I was posted as Naib Dafedar at P/S. BMP 
Bawata, Dera Ghazi Khan. On the same day, I alongwith Muhammad 
Jameel Sawar, Khalil Ahmad Sawar was present on patrolling duty at Picket 
Bawata Check post. In the meanwhile, at about 11:50 AM, A Corolla Grandi 
bearing Registration No.643/BHU white in colour, coming from 
Baluchistan towards Punjab reached at Check Post. We stopped said car 
which was driven by one person, I interrogated the driver, who disclosed his 
name as Muhammad Shahid Mehmood S/O Ejaz Khan, resident of Kanjror 
Kotla Afghanan, Tehsil Shakar Garh, District Narowal. Being a suspicious, 
I checked the said car and found 12-packets charas was recovered from the 
secrete cavities of tanky of the said car. Upon checking the said packets, 
Charas was found. On weighing by me, each packet was found 1000 grams. 
I separated 50/50 grams Charas from each packet as representative parcels 
and sealed it into parcels while remaining Charas was also separately sealed 
into parcels with the stamp of NU. I took remaining parcels 12 P-1 to P-12 
as well as 12-representative parcels of charas into possession vide recovery

two notes of 500/500 P15/1-2 and one note of 100 P-16 was recovered from 
the accused, which also took into possession vide recovery memo Exh.P.E 
which is attested by Muhammad Jameel Sawar and Khalil Ahmad Sawar. I

Jameel and Khalil Ahmad Sawar U/S 161 Cr.P.C and Kareem Nawaz 
Jamedar, completed his investigation at spot.” 
 
4. 
 
On the above stated facts, F.I.R  No. 29 of 2020 (Exh.PA)  dated 
09.12.2020 was registered at Police Station BMP Bawata, District Dera Ghazi 
Khan, in respect of an offence under section 9(c) of the Control of Narcotic 
Substances Act, 1997. 
 
5. 
 
After the formal investigation of the case, report under section 
173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 was submitted before the learned 
trial court and the appellant namely Muhammad Shahid Mehmood son of Ejaz 
Khan was sent to face trial. The learned trial court framed the charge against 
the accused on 18.01.2021 under section 9(c) of the Control of Narcotic 
Substances Act, 1997 . The accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial and 
the learned trial Court proceeded to examine the prosecution witnesses.

6. 
 
In order to prove the facts, the prosecution got as many as five 
witnesses examined. The prosecution got Muhammad Jameel ,  Sawar (PW-
2) and Nasrullah Khan,Naib Dafedar (PW-5) examined as witnesses of the 
recovery of the twelve packets (P-1 to P-12) containing “Charas”, each packet 
weighing 1000 grams, from the possession of the appellant, which twelve 
packets (P-1to P-12)  of  “Charas” were recovered from the secret cavities of 
the car (P-13) as was being driven by the appellant. Sohrab Khan, Naib 
Dafedar (PW-1)  stated that on 09.12.2020, he got recorded the formal F.I.R 
(Exh. PA ). Abdul Hakeem Moharrir (PW-3)  stated that on 09.12.2020, 
Kareem Nawaz Jamedar (PW-4), the Investigating Officer of the case,  
handed over to him twelve sealed parcels said to contain the samples drawn 
and separated from the recovered packets of  “Charas”  and twelve sealed 
parcels said to contain the remaining packets of the recovered “Charas” for 
keeping them in safe custody and on 14.12.2020, he handed over the twelve 
sealed parcels said to contain the samples drawn and separated from the 
recovered packets of “Charas” to Muhammad Jameel , Sawar (PW-2) for their 
onward transmission to the office of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, 
Lahore  .  The prosecution witness namely Kareem Nawaz, Jamedar (PW-4)   
investigated the case from 09.12.2020 till its conclusion and detailed the facts 
of his investigation in his statement before the learned trial court. 
 
7.  
 
On 17.10.2022, the learned Assistant District Public Prosecutor 
gave up the prosecution witness namely Khalil Ahmad ,Sawar as being 
unnecessary and closed the prosecution evidence after tendering in evidence 
the report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PG) .

8. 
 
After closing of prosecution evidence, the statement of the 
appellant was recorded under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
1898 and the appellant pleaded his innocence and in reply to as to why the 
PWs had deposed against him, he stated that the witnesses were Police 
Officials, who deposed falsely against him just to strengthen the prosecution 
being subordinate of the complainant of the case. The appellant opted not to 
appear in terms of section 340(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 
and did not adduce any evidence in his defence. 
 
9. 
 
After completion of evidence and hearing both the parties, the 
learned trial court held the appellant guilty of the offence and sentenced him 
as referred to above.  
 
10. 
        The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the 
prosecution had failed miserably to prove the case against the appellant. 
Learned counsel further argued that while examining the appellant under 
section 342 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 , the learned trial court posed 
the question that the twelve packets (P-1 to P-12) containing “Charas”, each 
packet weighing 1000 grams, were recovered from the personal search  of the 
appellant whereas the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Jameel,  
Sawar (PW-2) and Nasrullah Khan,Naib Dafedar (PW-5) had stated that the 
twelve packets (P-1 to P-12) containing “Charas”, each packet weighing 1000 
grams, were recovered from the secret cavities of the car (P-13) as was being 
driven by the appellant, therefore the appellant was misled in his defence and 
the appellant could not be convicted on the basis of evidence which he had 
not been questioned about while examining the appellant under section 342 
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898.   

Crl. Appeal No. 243-J of 2023

11. 
      On the other hand, the learned District Public Prosecutor appearing 
on behalf of the State submitted that the prosecution had proved the charge by 
producing admissible and relevant evidence. He further submitted that all the 
witnesses corroborated each other. He requested that the appeal be dismissed. 
 
12. 
        We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant as well as the 
learned District Public Prosecutor and perused the record.  
 
 
13. 
         At the very outset, we have noticed that the learned trial court, 
while examining the appellant under section 342 Code of Criminal Procedure, 
1898 , posed the question to the appellant that the twelve packets (P-1 to P-
12) containing “Charas” , each packet weighing 1000 grams, were recovered 
from the personal search of the appellant whereas the prosecution witnesses 
namely Muhammad Jameel,  Sawar (PW-2) and Nasrullah Khan, Naib 
Dafedar (PW-5) had stated that the twelve packets (P-1 to P-12) containing 
“Charas” , each packet weighing 1000 grams, were recovered from the secret 
cavities of the car (P-13) as was being driven by the appellant. The learned 
trial court ,while recording the statement of the appellant under section 342 
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 , questioned as under:- 
Q.2     It is in the prosecution evidence that on 09.12.2020, at about 11:50 
AM, in the area of check post BMP Bawata, you accused was arrested; on 
your personal search 12 packets of chars, which were 1000-grams in each 
packet, were recovered from your possession vide recovery memo Ex.P-C, 
which is attested by the witnesses Khaleel Ahmed Swar and Muhammad 
Jameel Sawar. What do you say about it? 
                 Ans.   I know nothing about it.” (emphasis supplied)  
It is obvious that the learned trial court erred when it posed the question that 

Crl. Appeal No. 243-J of 2023 
7 
 
the twelve packets (P-1 to P-12) containing “Charas”, each packet weighing 
1000 grams, were recovered from the personal search of the appellant 
whereas according to the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Jameel,  
Sawar (PW-2) and Nasrullah Khan,Naib Dafedar (PW-5), the twelve packets 
(P-1 to P-12) containing “Charas”, each packet weighing 1000 grams, were 
recovered from the secret cavities of the car (P-13) as was being driven by 
the appellant. Section 342, Cr.P.C. reads as under:  
 
342. Power to examine the accused.---(1) For the purpose of enabling the 
accused to explain any circumstances appearing in the evidence against him, 
the Court may, at any stage of any inquiry or trial without previously warning 
the accused, put such questions to him as the Court considers necessary, and 
shall for the purpose aforesaid, question him generally on the case after the 
witnesses for the prosecution have been examined and before he is called on 
for his defence.  
 
(2) The accused shall not render himself liable to punishment by refusing 
to answer such questions or by giving false answers to them; but the Court 
may draw such inference from such refusal or answer as it thinks just.  
 
(3) The answers given by the accused may be taken into consideration in 
such inquiry or trial, and put in evidence for or against him in any other 
inquiry into, or trial for, any other offence which such answers may tend to 
show he has committed.  
 
(4) Except as provided by subsection (2) of Section 340 no oath shall be 
administered to the accused.  
 
Section 342, Cr.P.C. consists of two parts. The first part ordains that at any 
stage of inquiry or trial the Court may, without previously warning the 
accused, ask him questions to elicit his explanation in respect of any 
evidence brought against him. On the other hand, the second part casts a 
duty on the Court to question him generally on the case after the 
prosecution witnesses have been examined and before he is called on for 
his defence. The examination of the accused under section 342, Cr.P.C. 
must relate to the evidence and the circumstances which are brought 
against him by the prosecution during the trial. It is not an inane formality 
but has to be carried out in the interest of justice and fair play. In the case 
of Abdul Wahab v. The Crown (PLD 1955 FC 88), the Federal Court 

Crl. Appeal No. 243-J of 2023 
8 
 
observed as under:  
"The opening words of section are very important. It is 'for the purpose of 
enabling the accused to explain the circumstances appearing in evidence 
against him' that his examination is needed. Where 'the circumstances 
appearing in evidence against him' are not put to the accused and his 
explanation is not taken thereupon, it cannot be said that the purpose of 
section 342 has been fulfilled. It is not a mere formality, but is an essential 
part of the trial that the accused should be given notice of the point or points 
which he must meet in order to exonerate himself. … It should not, however, 
be overlooked that the real object of section 342 is not to subject the accused 
to a detailed cross-examination. It is, as a matter of fact, inviting his attention 
to the point or points in the evidence which are likely to influence the mind 
of the Judge in arriving at conclusions adverse to the accused, and before such 
an adverse inference can be drawn, the accused should be afforded an 
opportunity to offer an explanation, if he has any."  
 
Similarly, in the case of S.A.K. Rehmani v. The State (2005 SCMR 364),the 
august Supreme Court of  Pakistan observed as under:- 
 "The purpose of this section is that the Court should give an opportunity to 
the accused to give such explanation as he may consider necessary in regard 
to the salient points made against him. It is, however, not intended merely 
for his benefit. It is part of a system for enabling the Court to discover the 
truth, and it constantly happens that the accused's explanation, or his failure 
to explain, is the most incriminating circumstance against him. The result 
of the examination may certainly benefit the accused if a satisfactory 
explanation is offered by him; it may, however, be injurious to him if no 
explanation or a false or unsatisfactory explanation is given." 
 
It is the mandate of the law that every incriminating evidence or 
circumstance that is sought to be used against an accused must be put to 
him under section 342, Cr. P.C. for the purpose of enabling the accused to 
explain the same.It is essential that the attention of an accused should be 
drawn to all the pieces of evidence one by one, avoiding the form of cross-
examination, in order to afford him an opportunity of giving an explanation,  
consistent with his innocence. It is trite law, nevertheless fundamental, that 
the accused's attention should be drawn to every inculpatory material so as 
to enable him to explain it. This is the basic fairness of a criminal trial and 
failures in this area may gravely imperil the validity of the trial itself, if 

Crl. Appeal No. 243-J of 2023

consequential miscarriage of justice occurs. However, where such an 
omission has occurred it does not ipso facto vitiate the proceedings and 
prejudice occasioned by such defect must be established by the accused. 
The question of whether a trial is vitiated or not due to defects and errors 
made by the learned trial court while examining an accused under section 
342 Cr.P.C. depends upon the degree of the error and the accused must show 
that non-compliance of section 342 Cr.P.C. has materially prejudiced him 
in his defence. Merely because of defective questioning under section 342  
Cr.P.C., it cannot be inferred that any prejudice had been caused to the 
accused, even assuming that some incriminating circumstances in the 
prosecution case had been left out. When prejudice to the accused is 
alleged, it has to be shown that the accused had suffered some disability or 
detriment in relation to the safeguard given to him under section 342 Cr.P.C. 
Such prejudice should also demonstrate that it has occasioned a failure of 
justice . The burden is upon the accused to prove that prejudice has been 
caused to him and such prejudice be implicit. In the case of S.A.K. Rehmani 
v. The State (2005 SCMR 364),the august Supreme Court of  Pakistan 
observed as under:- 
 "We have also adverted to the question that what should be the impact of 
non-compliance of the provisions as contemplated in section 342, Cr.P.C. 
We have thrashed out all the most entire precedent law: PLD 1969 Peshawar 
12, 1969 SCMR 416, PLD 1960 Lahore 822, PLD 1960 Lahore 547, AIR 
1962 SC 1229, AIR 1961 SC 175, AIR 1960 Raj. 80, AIR 1954 SC 692, 
AIR 1956 SC 731, AIR 1954 SC 660, PLD 1956 Lahore 174, PLD 1957 SC 
(Ind.) 133, ILR (1956) 2 All. 127, 1954 FCR 223, AIR 1961 SC 175, AIR 
1960 Raj. 80, AIR 1954 SC 692, DLR FC 123, DLR FC 139, and judicial 
consensus seems to be that 'every error or omission amounting to non-
compliance with the provisions of this section does not necessarily vitiates 
the trial; such errors fall within the category of curable irregularities and the 
question whether the trial is vitiated, in each case depends upon the degree 
of the error and upon the question whether prejudice has been or is likely to 
have been caused to the accused'. It must not be lost sight of that 'every 
defect or error in the examination under section 342, Cr.P.C. would not be 
consequential unless it is shown that prejudice has been caused and moreso, 
the nature of prejudice must be stated'. AIR 1960 Rajastan 80, AIR 1956 SC 
536, AIR 1956 SC 241. There is no cavil with the proposition that 'there 
must be proof of prejudice to the accused and unless miscarriage of justice 

Crl. Appeal No. 243-J of 2023 
10 
 
is shown to have occurred, particularly in a case where the accused was 
represented by counsel, inadequate examination under S. 342 cannot be 
made a ground for setting aside the conviction.' 21 DLR 377, PLD 1955 
Dacca 68, AIR 1961 Calcutta 240 and AIR 1956 SC 536." (emphasis 
supplied)  
 
From the above discussion, it follows that the appellate court has to 
examine all the incriminating material produced by the prosecution and see 
what  piece of evidence or circumstance has not been put to the accused and 
its impact on the fate of the case. Similarly, it would determine whether the 
questions put to him were in accordance with law and he was not misled by 
any of them. If it comes to the conclusion that non-compliance with the 
provisions of section 342, Cr.P.C. has prejudiced the accused it may remit 
the matter to the trial Court for retrial from the point where the irregularity 
occurred, that is, from the stage of questioning the accused under section 
342 Cr.P.C.. The noted maxim which connotes "an act of the court shall 
prejudice no man" is founded upon justice and good sense; and affords a 
safe and certain guide for the administration of law and justice. It is meant 
to promote and ensure that the ends of justice are met; it prescribes that no 
harm and injury to the rights and the interest of the litigants before the court 
shall be caused by the act or omission of the court. This rule of 
administration of justice is meant for the benefit of both sides of litigants 
before the court and it would be illogical to conceive that the rule would or 
should be applied for the advantage of one litigant to the prejudice and 
disadvantage of the other. It is the duty of the court to act as a neutral arbiter 
between the parties and to provide justice to them through strict adherence 
to the law and keeping in mind the facts of each case. Directing the learned 
trial court to correctly examine the appellant under  section 342 Cr.P.C. 
cannot be condemned as filling up the lacuna in the prosecution case.

14.            In this view of the above discussion, the instant Criminal Appeal 
No. 243-J of 2023 is allowed in the terms that the case is remanded to the 
trial court to continue the trial from the stage where the irregularity occurred, 
i.e. from the stage of examining the appellant under section 342, Cr.P.C. with 
the direction to question the appellant regarding all the incriminating pieces 
of evidence for his explanation while re-examining the appellant under section 
342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 and pass a fresh judgment after 
affording an opportunity of hearing to both sides,i.e. the prosecution and the 
defence,  within a period of three months after the receipt of the certified copy 
of this judgment. During retrial, the appellant shall be treated as an under trial 
prisoner and his custody shall be regulated in the same manner. The conviction 
and sentence of the appellant recorded by the learned trial court vide judgment 
dated 01.03.2023 for the offence under section 9(c)  of the Control of Narcotic 
Substances Act, 1997  are set aside.
