Ch. Muhammad Iqbal, J:-  Through this intra court 
appeal the appellant has challenged the validity of order dated 
22.11.2022 passed by the learned Single Judge in Chamber 
whereby Writ Petition No.73497/2022 filed by appellant was 
dismissed. 
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that the appellant’s husband 
Muhammad Aslam who was an employee of Pakistan Mint 
passed away during his service and the appellant being widow of 
the deceased employee was appointed as Naib Qasid (BS-01) in 
Pakistan Mint on contract basis for a period of five years on 
03.01.2020 in the light of a notification dated 04.12.2015 titled 
“Revision of Assistance Package for Families of Government 
Employees who Die in Service”. The appellant contracted second 
marriage upon which respondent authority while relying on a 
notification dated 15.12.2015 issued by the Establishment 
Division, Government of Pakistan terminated her service on 
30.9.2021. The appellant challenged her termination order as well

as Memorandum dated 21.06.2022 whereby request for her 
reinstatement was declined through W.P. No.73497/2022. The 
learned Single Judge in Chamber dismissed the writ petition vide 
order dated 22.11.2022 on the ground that the appellant was a 
contract employee as such the writ petition is not maintainable. 
Hence, this appeal.   
3. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
4. 
Admittedly, the husband of the appellant who was serving 
in the respondent-department/Pakistan Mint died during his 
service. The appellant being widow of deceased employee was 
appointed as Naib Qasid (BS-01) vide Memorandum/Order dated 
03.01.2020 on contract basis for a period of five years in 
pursuance of notification dated 04.12.2015 titled “Revision of 
Assistance Package for Families of Government Employees who 
Die in Service” and accordingly the appellant joined her duties. 
Thereafter, she contracted second marriage upon which she was 
terminated from the service on 30.9.2021 on the basis of a 
notification dated 15.12.2015 issued by the Establishment 
Division, Government of Pakistan. Marriage is a religiously, 
ritually, socially and legally recognized bond between spouses 
that establishes rights and obligations between them. Islam, being 
a complete code of life, it not only provides guidance about the 
process of contracting first marriage of a Muslim [male or 
female] but also guides about the second marriage in case of 
death of a spouse. Prior to teaching of Islam and unfortunately 
even at present in different parts of the world, second marriage of 
a widow, was/ is treated as a social evil, which practice has 
seriously been discouraged by Islam. Allah Ta’la in Quran 
Majeed in clear terms has not only given choice to a widow to 
contract marriage but also has ordered to support marriage of a 

 
I.C.A. No.77894/2022

widow. In this regard, translation of two verses (Ayaat-e-Karima) 
from Holy Quran are mentioned hereunder: 
"
 اور وج ولگ مت ںیم ےس رم اجںیئ اور وعرںیت وھچڑ اجںیئ وت وعرںیت اچر ےنیہم دس دن اےنپ آپ وک
 روےک رںیہ۔ اور بج (ہی) دعت وپری رک ںیکچ اور اےنپ قح ںیم دنسپدیہ اکم (ینعی اکنح) رک ںیل وت

 : (وسرۃ ارقبلہ234
) 
 
" "اور اینپ وقم یک ویبہ وعروتں ےک اکنح رک دای رکو۔ 
 
 
 : (وسرۃ اونلر32
) 
 
Further, Articles 31 and 35 of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 also guarantees the citizens of this 
country to order their lives in accordance with the fundamental 
principles and basic concepts of Islam. The Constitution also 
guarantees the protection of marriage and family of a citizen. For 
ready reference the above said Articles of the Constitution are 
reproduced as under: 
 “31. (1) Steps shall be taken to enable the Muslims of 
Pakistan, individually and collectively, to order their lives in 
accordance with the fundamental principles and basic concepts 
of Islam and to provide facilities whereby they may be enabled 
to understand the meaning of life according to the Holy Quran 
and Sunnah. 
(2) The State shall endeavour, as respects the Muslims of 
Pakistan,—  
(a) to make the teaching of the Holy Quran and Islamiat 
compulsory, to encourage and facilitate the learning of 
Arabic language and to secure correct and exact printing 
and publishing of the Holy Quran; 
(b) to promote unity and the observance of the Islamic 
moral standards; and 
(c) to secure the proper organisation of zakat, ushr, auqaf 
and mosques. 
…. 
35. The State shall protect the marriage, the family, the mother 
and the child.”

As per aforequoted verses from Holy Quran as well as provisions of 
the Constitution, it is crystal clear that a Muslim widow cannot be 
prevented or discouraged to contract marriage rather her such action is 
appreciable which is duly safeguarded by Shariah. A widow, at the 
time of death of her husband, is given her due share from the estate left 
by her husband and there is no embargo on her to contract second 
marriage after the completion of stipulated period of Iddat. The 
Government in contravention to the aforesaid principles of Shariah as 
well as Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 issued 
Memorandum dated 15.12.2015 that a widow, who was granted 
employment (job) on the ground of demise of her husband during 
service, will be disentitled to continue her service on account of her 
solemnizing of second marriage.   
5. 
The Federal Government through office Memorandum dated 
15.12.2015 clarified that the appointment of a widow of the deceased 
servant of the Government is a part of terminal benefits to which 
widow is entitled. For ready reference, Memorandum dated 
15.12.2015 is reproduced as under:- 
GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN 
CABINET SECRETARIAT 
ESTABLISHMENT DIVISION 
****** 
No.8/10/2013-E-2 
Islamabad, the 15th December, 2015 
 
OFFICE MEMORANDUM 
 
Subject: 
ASSISTANCE PACKAGE FOR  
  
 
FAMILIES OF GOVERNMENT  
 
EMPLOYEES WHO DIED IN SERVICE. 
 
 
 
The undersigned is directed to refer the subject 
cited above and to state that queries and references have been 
received in the Division that whether a widow who was 
appointed under Prime Minister’s Assistance Package is 
entitled for extension in contract appointment after 
remarriage. The issue has been considered in this Division. It 
is clarified that appointment of a widow of the deceased 
Government servant is a part of terminal benefits to which a 
widow is entitled. After remarriage the widow becomes 
ineligible to receive family pension. Therefore, this Division 
is of the view that her contract should be terminated from the 

 
I.C.A. No.77894/2022 
 
5
date of her remarriage. In case, she got married after 
regularization of her service, she would only be ineligible for 
pensionary benefits of her earlier deceased husband. 
(Mansoor Ahmed) 
Section Officer (E-2)  
 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
The vires of the above said Memorandum were challenged before 
Islamabad High Court in a case titled as Mst. Samia Tabassum 
Vs. Federation of Pakistan through Writ Petition No.389 of 2016 
and the said Memorandum was declared ultra vires and illegal 
vide judgment dated 27.05.2016. The relevant portion of the 
judgment is reproduced as under: 
…The impugned Office Memorandum dated 15-12-2015 is 
sheer violation of Articles 34 and 35 of the Constitution of 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan according to which steps shall be 
taken to ensure full participation of women in all spheres of 
national life as well as to provide protection to marriage, the 
family, the mother and the child. However, in the instant 
matter it is quite astonishing that the respondents are depriving 
the petitioner from a legal right for which she is ultimately 
entitled because though she has remarried but despite that two 
daughters of deceased Muhammad Irfan Siddique and 
petitioners are being looked after by her. The impugned order 
dated 15-12-2015 is also against the principle of Locus 
poenitentiae. The petitioner was appointed after fulfillment of 
all the formalities under the Prime Minister Assistance 
Package and as such it cannot be held that the said 
appointment was procured by the petitioner through fraud, 
concealment of facts or by impersonation. And in such a way a 
legal right has been created in favour of petitioner which 
cannot be taken away merely on the basis of her re-marriage. 
In this regard I am also fortified by the judgment reported as 
2015 SCMR 1418 titled as Mst. Basharat Jehan Versus 
Director General, Federal Government Education, FGEI 
(C/O) Rawalpindi and others wherein it was held that:- 
“Once a right is accrued to the appellant by 
appointment letters issued after complying with the all 
codal formalities could not be taken away on mere 
assumption and or supposition and or whims and fancy 
of any executive functionary. Such right once vests, 
cannot be destroyed or withdrawn as legal bar would 
come into play under the well doctrine of locus 
poenitentiae, well recognized and entrenched in our 
jurisprudence.” 

 
I.C.A. No.77894/2022

As such, the impugned office Memorandum dated 15th 
December, 2015 has been issued without any legal justification 
and is hereby declared as illegal as well as against the 
fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution of 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan. 
The said judgment was challenged before the Hon'ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan through Civil Petition No.2666 of 2016 which 
was dismissed vide order dated 03.11.2017 with the following 
observation:  
 “4. The very perusal of the Office Memorandum would reveal 
that it was issued in a mechanical way without due diligence 
and application of mind. This on the fact of it is against the 
constitutional and fundamental rights of a person provided by 
the Constitution of the land. It is an alienable right of every 
citizen to have the protection of law and also to be treated and 
dealt with in accordance with law with the particularity that no 
one can take action against the detrimental to his life and 
liberty and cannot be prevented from an act which is not 
prohibited by law. The reasons made the basis of questioned 
Office Memorandum have no statutory backing or carry any 
intellection behind the same. It would not be legally and 
morally justified at this stage to snatch the bread of the two 
minor daughters of the deceased employee. 
           The learned Judge of the High Court while allowing the 
Writ Petition has mainly held that although the respondent 
No.1 remarried but the fact remains that two daughters of the 
deceased Mohammad Irfan Siddiqui are being looked after by 
the respondent and that the appointment of respondent was 
made after completing all codal formalities and the same was 
not the result of any fraud or concealment of facts. We, in the 
circumstances, find no error of law in the impugned judgment 
of the High Court.” 
6. 
The service of the appellant was terminated by the 
respondents on the ground of re-marriage vide order dated 
30.09.2021, which order is reproduced as under:

In pursuance of re-marriage of Ms. Zoya Islam,

After receipt of her termination order, the appellant filed an 
application to the respondent/Director General, Pakistan Mint,

marriage as per Shariah and the Memorandum in question has 
been declared illegal by the Superior Courts as such she may be 
reinstated into service. The application moved by the appellant is

The respondents, despite knowledge of the dictum of the Superior 
Courts on the matter in issue, instead of reinstating the appellant 
into service, remained adamant to follow the illegal and unlawful 
instructions of the Establishment Division and declined the 
request of the appellant for reinstatement vide order dated 
21.06.2022 as under: 
 “Government of Pakistan 
Pakistan Mint 
****** 
No.927/2021-HR/1330        Lahore, the 21st  June, 2022 
 
OFFICE ORDER 
 
Subject:- 
Request for re-instatement of contract 
 
appointment 
 
Reference your application dated 10-03-2022 
for re-instatement of contract appointment. You are hereby 
informed that your request is hereby turned down being not 
covered under the rules as clarified by the Establishment 
Division vide O.M. No.8/4/2018-E-2 dated 06-06-2022.

Admin Officer” 
 
As the Memorandum in question dated 15.12.2015 has already 
been declared illegal by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, 
as such under Article 189 of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, compliance of the decisions rendered by 
the Hon'ble Apex Court is mandatory for all the organs of the 
state. Reliance in this regard is placed on the cases cited as 
Muhammad Sharif Vs. Settlement Commissioner and others 
(2007 SCMR 707), Iffat Jabeen Vs. District Education Officer 
(M.E.E), Lahore and another (2011 SCMR 437) and Dr. Iqrar 
Ahmad Khan Vs. Dr. Muhammad Ashraf and others (2021 
SCMR 1509). Thus, the application of the appellant for her 
reinstatement was malafidely and illegally declined by the 
respondents in contemptuous manner.  

 
I.C.A. No.77894/2022

7.  
In the aforesaid circumstances, it can safely be held that 
the termination order dated 30.09.2021 of the appellant on the 
ground of re-marriage was arbitrarily issued by the respondent-
department 
in 
violation 
of 
the 
principles 
of 
Shariah,                     
Constitution as well as supra dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan, as such same is nullity in the eyes of law and 
liable to be set aside.  
8. 
For what has been discussed above, instant appeal is 
allowed, the order dated 22.11.2022 passed by the learned Single 
Judge in Chamber is set aside and consequently the Writ Petition 
[No.73497/2022] filed by the appellant is accepted and the orders 
of her termination dated 30.09.2021 as well as decline of request 
for reinstatement dated 21.06.2022 are also set at naught 
accordingly.
