ASIM HAFEEZ, J.  This Intra Court Appeal is directed 
against the order of learned Single Judge-in-Chambers, dated 
05.03.2024 (identified as an “impugned order”), whereby 
constitutional petition bearing W.P No.1333 of 2024/BWP, 
preferred by respondent No.1, against the order of Election 
Commission of Pakistan dated 22.02.2024 (for the purposes of 
this appeal, deemed as an “original order”), was accepted and 
original order, including notice dated 25.02.2024 for attending

Matter-in-issue relates to the election for National 
Assembly 
constituency, 
NA-154, 
Lodhran-I, 
held 
on 
08.02.2024, whereby respondent No.3 statedly secured 134,937 
votes against 128,438 votes, secured by the appellant. 
Returning Officer delivered Final Consolidated result – 
[Form-49] – to the Election Commission on 09.02.2024. 
Appellant was the runner-up candidate. It is the case of the 
appellant that he had submitted application on 09.02.2024, for 
seeking recount of votes of all the polling stations of the 
constituency, which was neither considered nor decided, and 
appellant had to approach the Election Commission. Record 
depicts that Returning Officer had indicated factum of 
application for recount of votes to the Regional Election 
Commissioner, Multan, through correspondence of 10.02.2024, 
contents whereof, for quick understanding, are reproduced

Reference:  
The application (enclosed) received dated 09.02.2024 on the 
subject cited above regarding recounting of votes of all 
polling stations in NA 154, Lodhran-I by the contesting 
candidate Mr. Abdul Rehman Khan Kanju. 
   
It is apprised that the applicant has sought

of receipt of his application, the electoral record of the 
constituency NA-154 had already been handed over to the 
office of Regional Election Commissioner, Multan. 
   
Therefore, the above mentioned request can only 
be entertained if the undersigned is given access to the 
electoral record. It is therefore prayed that the necessary 
permission may please be granted to access the said record as 
per provisions of the relevant law(s).

Subject: APPLICATION UNDER SECTION 95 READ WITH ALL OTHER ENABLING 
PROVISIONS OF ELECTIONS ACT, 2017 AND ELECTION RULES, 2017 
THEREUNDER. 
Reference your letter No.41/RO/ ADC(F&P)/LD dated 10-02-2024 
regarding the subject cited above. 
  
As per contents of your letter the recounting application of the 
candidate has been rejected and consolidation of result has been completed 
by you. Resultantly the polling record has been consigned in the Strong 
Room of Election Commission of Pakistan established in office of the 
Regional Election Commissioner, Multan Division, Multan on 10-02-2024 at 
3:00 AM. Once the final consolidation of result has been made then the 
recounting powers of Returning Officer under Section 95 cannot be 
exercised, and seeking asses to polling record seems irrelevant here. So the 
asses to polling record consigned in the Strong Room can only be provided 
in presence of any recounting order from any competent forum.

Case No. 7(160)/2024 LAW-111 (GE) 
In Ref:  PETITION/ APPLICATION UNDER SECTION 95(5) AND ALL OTHERS 
ENABLING PROVISIONS OF ELECTION. 
  
I have been directed vide order dated 14.02.2023 to file a report 
as a Returning Officer of NA-154, Lodhran-1. As per the Form-49, the 

 
4
Petitioner, Abdul Rehman Khan Kanju secured 128,438 votes, and the 
returned candidate, Rana Muhammad Faraz Noon secured 134,937 
votes. The difference in the vote count is less than 5%. 
  
It is stated that although the application for recount was 
received at my office before consolidation, I was not able to pass an 
order on the same immediately, because of law and order situation 
created by the returned candidate Rana Muhammad Faraz Noon. Hence, 
I was unable to pass an order on the recount application which should 
have been done as per Section 95 of the Election Act. However, 
subsequently, I referred the same to the Regional Election 
Commissioner, Multan vide my letter dated 10.02.2024. I am able and 
willing to recount the votes if an appropriate order is passed by the 
Honorable Commission.

[Emphasis supplied] 
Notably, appellant, on 11.02.2024, had submitted application 
for recount of the votes of entire constituency to the Election 
Commission, primarily invoking section 95(5) and all other 
enabling provisions of the Elections Act, 2017 and Election 
Rules, 2017. Notwithstanding exchange of correspondences 
between Returning Officer and office of Regional Election 
Commissioner, Election Commission, on 16th February 2024, 
issued Notification No.F.2(5)/2024-Cord (1), declaring and 
directing publication of name of respondent No.1 as returned 
candidate to the National Assembly of Pakistan. Request for 
recount of votes was entertained, after Notification of 16th 
February 2024, by Election Commission, purportedly in 
exercise of jurisdiction under Article 218(3) of the Constitution 
of Pakistan 1973 (‘Constitution’), and other enabling 
provisions, vide original order [passed on 22.02.2024]. Reasons 
extended were that it was a fit case for the recount of votes, 
whereupon Returning Officer was directed to do the needful 
within one week, upon notice to the parties. In essence, original 
order is central to the controversy, paragraphs 4 and 5 thereof 
read as, 
“4. 
The Commission is constituted under Article 218(2) of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan and is charged with 
the duty to organize and conduct elections and to make such 
arrangements that elections are conducted honestly, justly, fairly 
and in accordance with law and corrupt practices are guarded 
against. The Commission after due consideration is of the opinion 

 
5
that it is a fit case of recounting. Therefore, we in exercise of 
powers under Article 218(3) of the Constitution of Pakistan 1973 
and all other powers enabling in this behalf for free and just 
decision in the matter order recount and direct the Returning 
Officer concerned that he shall carry out the recounting of votes 
of this constituency in the presence of all the parties strictly in 
accordance with law. Returning Officer is further directed to 
complete the process of recounting within one week and thereafter 
result be communicated to this Commission. 
  
5. Relist for 04.03.2024.” 
[Emphasis Supplied] 
3. 
It is apprised that pursuant to original order notices dated 
25.02.2024 were issued by the Returning Officer to the parties, 
indicating factum of recounting exercise on 26.02.2024. 
Recounting was carried out. Respondent No.1 submitted review 
petition against original order, which, as per statement(s) made 
at the bar, was withdrawn and instead W.P. No.1333 of 
2024/BWP was preferred, which came up for hearing on 
26.02.2024, when interim injunction was granted, whereby 
operation of original order and notice(s) issued were suspended. 
Record depicts that Returning Officer concluded exercise of 
recount of votes and submitted report to the Election 
Commission, in terms whereof appellant secured highest 
number of votes. Constitutional petition was heard and accepted 
vide impugned order. Instant appeal is preferred by the 
appellant, wherein, impugned order was suspended, through 
interim 
injunctive 
order. 
Election 
Commission 
issued 
Notification dated 22.03.2024, declaring appellant as a returned 
candidate, and withdrew earlier Notification dated 16.02.2024, 
declaring it ab-initio – effect of subsequently issued 
Notification was subjected to the outcome of instant Appeal. 
Respondents are on notice. Appeal is heard at length. 
Objection qua maintainability of appeal: 
4. 
At the outset, learned counsels for respondent No.1 
pleaded that appeal is not maintainable in terms of proviso to 
subsection (2) of section 3 of Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 
(referred as “Ordinance”) because remedy of review was 
available before Election Commission, under clause (b) of 

 
6
Section 8 of the Elections Act, 2017 (“Elections Act”). It is 
alternatively argued that if exercise of jurisdiction, by Election 
Commission while passing original order, was purportedly 
claimed to have had exercised under subsection (1) of section 9 
of the Elections Act, still remedy of appeal is available before 
the Hon’ble Supreme Court in terms of subsection (5) of 
section 9, ibid. Following decisions are relied upon, including 
an unreported decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan 
passed on 13.03.2024, in C.P.L.A No.1800-L of 2023, titled 
“National Bank of Pakistan through its President, Head Office, 
Karachi, etc. v. Muhammad Adeel”, and other cases are 
reported as “Sonia Raza V. Election Commission of Pakistan 
and others (2018 CLC 1966), Ejaz Ahmed Sandhu and another 
V. Election Commission of Pakistan through Chief Election, 
Commissioner, Islamabad and others (2018 SCMR 1367), 
Muhammad Mamoon Tarar V. Election Commission of 
Pakistan and others (2016 CLC 1708), Syed Arif Raza Rizvi V.

Commissioner, Centre-I, Lahore (PLD 1985 Supreme Court 
107) and Mst. Karim Bibi and others V. Hussain Bakhsh and 
another (PLD 1984 Supreme Court 344). 
Submissions in support of maintainability: 
5. 
While controverting objection to maintainability, learned 
counsel for appellant submits that no final / conclusive order 
was passed by the Returning Officer, who actually failed to 
decide application for recount of votes. And no remedy of 
review was available under clause (b) of section 8 of Elections 
Act, in absence of any order by Returning officer. Adds that 
order of 22.02.2024 was an interim order, simply directing 
recount of votes, and Election Commission retained seisin over 
the lis, and proceedings were kept pending for 04.03.2024. 
Learned counsel emphasized that assumption and exercise of 

 
7
jurisdiction by the Election Commission stood justified and 
validated under the scope of subsection (1) of section 9 of 
Elections Act, and since no final / conclusive order, by way of 
declaration envisaged, was made therefore, remedy of appeal 
under subsection (5) of section 9 of Elections Act is also not 
available - being pre-mature in absence of any conclusive 
declaration by the Election Commission. While explaining the 
import and significance of subsection (1) of section 9 of 
Elections Act, learned counsel states that gross illegalities were 
found in the process of consolidation of votes, whereby 
Returning Officer, notwithstanding that the conditions 
prescribed under sub-section (5) of section 95 of Elections Act 
were available, had failed to undertake an exercise of recount of 
votes, which apparent inaction constitutes patent violation of 
the Elections Act and Election Rules, providing justification for 
exercise of jurisdiction by the Election Commission.  
6. 
On Merits; Learned counsel for the appellant 
emphasized that non-performance of statutory duty by 
Returning officer constitutes infraction of gross scale, which 
was rightly rectified by Election Commission. Explains that 
application for recount was submitted within the timelines 
provided in section 95(5) of Elections Act, which fact was 
acknowledged by the Returning officer while exchanging 
correspondence(s) with Regional Election Commissioner – 
refers to report submitted vide letter of 16.02.2024 - text of the 
correspondences referred were reproduced in paragraph 2 of 
this decision. Further submits that under section 9(1) of 
Elections Act, Commission is entitled to undertake summary 
inquiry, who adds that illegalities committed were apparent on 
the face of the record and upon satisfying itself, Commission 
assumed and exercised jurisdiction under subsection (1) of 
section 9 of Elections Act. It is emphasized that recount of 
votes can be ordered by the Election Commission even under 
section 9(1), ibid, and outcome of exercise of jurisdiction 
cannot be restricted to ordering polls void or directing re-

 
8
poll(s). Elaborates that, in wake of the failure of the Returning 
Officer to exercise jurisdiction vested under section 95(5) of the 
Elections Act, appellant cannot be left remediless, and Election 
Commission, in the circumstances, had justifiably exercised 
jurisdiction to ensure fairness and justness in the conduct of 
elections. Further submits that remedy of constitutional petition 
was not available to respondent No.1, who could prefer appeal 
before Hon’ble Supreme Court once conclusive declaration was 
made by the Election Commission under Section 9(1) of 
Elections Act. Submits that Court(s) are not competent to call 
into question legality of any action taken by the Election 
Commission in good faith – refers to section 236 of the 
Elections Act.  
Arguments on behalf of Election Commission:  
7. 
Learned counsel for the Election Commission defended 
the original order on the strength of assumption and exercise of 
jurisdiction in terms of section 9 of the Elections Act, who 
elaborated that subsection (4) of section 9, ibid, confers 
concurrent jurisdiction unto Election Commission, as available 
to the Election Tribunal(s), which inter alia included power to 
direct recount of votes. Objects to availing of remedy of judicial 
review jurisdiction by respondent No.1 on the premise that only 
appeal could be filed before Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in terms of subsection (5) of section 9 of Elections Act 
against the original order. Learned counsel is asked to read 
original order of 22.02.2024 and explain proximity between 
original order and incidence of jurisdiction extended under 
section 9 of the Elections Act and how same was exercisable in 
wake of specific and timebound remedy of seeking recount 
under sub-section (6) of section 95 of Elections Act. Learned 
counsel for the Election Commission failed to persuade us that 
original order manifests exercise of jurisdiction under section 9 
of the Elections Act. 

 
9
8. 
On merits: Learned counsel for respondent No.1 
emphasized that Election Commission had no jurisdiction to 
order recount of votes once declaration of returned candidate 
was made in accordance with section 98 of the Elections Act. 
Adds that no jurisdiction is vested in the Election Commission 
to direct recount of votes under sub-section (6) of section 95 of 
the Elections Act after conclusion of consolidation proceedings 
and dispatch of electoral record by Returning Officer to the 
Regional office of the Election Commissioner. Adds that mal-
intent of the Commission is evident from the conduct 
demonstrated, in particular when original order was passed 
without any notice to respondent No.1 – reference is made to 
the text of original order to show absence of any reference to 
the presence of respondent No.1 or any of its election agent / 
representative. Further submits that upon issuance of the 
Notification of returned candidate on 16th February 2024 there 
was no justification for ordering recount on 22.02.2024, which 
conduct is unlawful, contrary to the mandate of law and 
otherwise denudes Commission’s claim of acting justly and 
fairly. Submits that no remedy was available to respondent 
No.1 under the Elections Act, against the order of 22.02.2024 
and in these circumstances review petition against said order 
was withdrawn and constitutional petition was filed, wherein 
precise question was seeking of declaration against exercise of 
jurisdiction by the Election Commission, not otherwise 
available or extended under the Elections Act upon lapse of 
time and happening of an event- declaration of returned 
candidate.  
9. Exercising the right of rebuttal, learned counsel for the 
appellant contends that respondent No.1 was duly represented 
at the time of recount of votes on 26.02.2024, before the 
Returning Officer. Adds that respondent No.1 was aware of the 
proceedings and order passed by the Election Commission, who 
opted to file review petition against the order of 22.02.2024 and 
withdrew it, upon invoking constitutional jurisdiction.  Refers 

 
10
to section 235 of the Elections Act to emphasize that absence of 
the candidate does not invalidate the act or thing required or 
authorized by the Act to be done in presence of the candidate. 
Relied upon the case of Sonia Raza V. Election Commission of 
Pakistan and others (2018 CLC 1966) in the context of failure 
of Returning Officer to act accordingly. 
10. 
Both learned counsels respectively placed reliance on the 
ratio laid down in the case of Zulfiqar Ali Bhatti V. Election 
Commission of Pakistan and others (Civil Appeal No.142 of 
2019 and Civil Petition No.1369 of 2019) by reading various 
paragraphs, each seeking support from the judgment in its own 
manner and context. 
11. 
Heard. Record Perused. 
12. 
It is appropriate to examine the scope of relevant 
provisions of Elections Act while considering the question of 
maintainability of instant appeal. To facilitate adjudication, 
sections 8, 9 and 95 of the Elections Act are relevant and 
reproduced hereunder, which read as, 
 
“Section.8. 
Power of Commission to ensure fair election.— Save  
as  otherwise  provided,  the Commission may — 
a) 
stop the polls at one or more polling stations at any 
stage of the election if it is convinced that it shall not be 
able to ensure the conduct of the election justly, fairly 
and in accordance with law due to large scale 
malpractices, including coercion, intimidation and 
pressures, prevailing at the election;  
b) 
review an order passed by an officer under this Act or 
the Rules, including rejection of a ballot paper; and  
c) 
issue such instructions, exercise such powers   and make 
such consequential orders as may in its opinion, be 
necessary for ensuring that an election is conducted 
honestly, justly, fairly and in accordance with the 
provisions of this Act and the Rules. 
 
Section 9.  Power of the Commission to declare a poll void. — (1) 
Notwithstanding  anything contained in this Act, if, from 
facts apparent on the face of the record and after such 
enquiry as it may deem necessary, the Commission is 
satisfied that by reason of grave illegalities or such 
violations of the provisions of this Act or the Rules as 
have materially affected the result of the poll at one or 
more polling stations or in the whole constituency 
including  implementation  of  an  agreement  
restraining women from casting their votes, it shall 
make a declaration accordingly and call upon the 
voters in the concerned polling station or stations or in 

 
11
the whole constituency as the case may be, to recast 
their votes in the manner provided for bye-elections.  
 
Explanation. — If the turnout of women voters is less than ten 
percent of the total votes polled in a constituency, the Commission 
may presume that the women voters have been restrained through 
an agreement from casting their votes and may declare, polling at 
one or more polling stations or election in the whole constituency, 
void. 
 
  
2) Notwithstanding the powers conferred on it by sub-
section (1), the Commission may order filing of complaint under 
this Act before a court of competent jurisdiction against persons 
who entered into the agreement referred to in sub-section (1).  
  
(3) Notwithstanding the publication of the name of a 
returned candidate under section 98, the Commission may exercise 
the powers conferred on it by sub-section (1) before the expiration 
of sixty days after such publication; and, where the Commission 
does not finally dispose of a case within the said period, the 
election of the returned candidate shall be deemed to have become 
final, subject to the decision of an Election Tribunal on an election 
petition, if any.  
  
(4) While exercising the powers conferred on it by sub-
section (1), the Commission shall be deemed to be an Election 
Tribunal to which an election petition has been presented and shall, 
notwithstanding anything contained in Chapter IX, regulate its own 
procedure.  
  
(5) Any person aggrieved by a declaration of the 
Commission under this section may, within thirty days of the 
declaration, prefer an appeal to the Supreme Court. 
 
Section 95. Consolidation of results.— (1)  Immediately  after  
announcement  of  provisional  results, the Returning Officer 
shall give the contesting candidates and their election agents a 
notice in writing of the day, time and place fixed for the 
consolidation of the results, and, in the presence of such of the 
contesting candidates and election agents as may be present, 
consolidate in the prescribed manner the Results of the Count 
furnished by the Presiding Officers, including therein the postal 
ballots received by him before the time fixed for the consolidation 
of results. 
 
 
 
Provided that presence of not more than one agent of 
each candidate shall be allowed. 
 
 
 
(2) Before consolidating the Results of the Count, the 
Returning Officer shall examine the ballot papers excluded from 
the count by the Presiding Officer and, if he finds that any such 
ballot paper should not have been so excluded, count it as a ballot 
paper cast in favour of the contesting candidate for whom the vote 
has been cast.  
 
 
 
(3) The Returning Officer shall also count the ballot 
papers received by him by post in such manner as may be 
prescribed and include the votes cast in favour of each contesting 
candidate in the Consolidated Statement except those which he may 
reject on any of the grounds mentioned in section 90.  
 
 
 
(4) The ballot papers rejected by the Returning Officer 
under sub-section (3) shall be mentioned separately in the 
consolidated statement.   
 
 
 
(5) Before commencement of the proceedings, the 
Returning Officer shall recount the ballot papers of one or more 

 
12
polling stations if a request or challenge in writing is made to that 
effect by a contesting candidate or his election agent and –  
(a)  the margin of victory between returned and runner up 
candidates is less than five percent of the total votes 
polled in the constituency or eight thousand votes in 
case of National Assembly constituency and four 
thousand votes in case of a Provincial Assembly 
constituency, as the case may be, whichever is less; or 
(b) the number of votes excluded from the count by the 
Presiding Officer are equal to or more than the margin 
of victory:  
Provided that the Returning Officer shall recount only once. 
(6)  The Commission may, before conclusion of the 
consolidation proceedings, and after notice to the contesting 
candidates] for reasons to be recorded, direct the Returning 
Officer to recount the ballot papers of one or more polling 
stations.  
(7)  If there is a difference between the Results of the Count 
received from the Presiding Officers and the results of the 
recount, the Returning Officer shall record the difference and 
details thereof:  
Provided that where the Returning Officer has recounted the 
votes under sub-section (5) or sub-section (6), the consolidation 
proceedings shall be completed within –  
(a)  seven days after the polling day in the case of elections 
to the National Assembly; and 
(b) five days after the polling day in the case of elections to 
a Provincial Assembly. 
(8)   The Returning Officer shall, within twenty four hours 
after the consolidation proceedings, send to the Commission 
signed copies of the Consolidated Statement of the Results of 
the Count and Final Consolidated Result together with 
Results of the Count and the Ballot Paper Account, as 
received from the Presiding Officers, and shall retain copies 
of these documents for record.  
(9) After consolidation of results, the Returning Officer shall 
give to such contesting candidates and their election agents 
and accredited observers] as are present during the 
consolidation proceedings a copy of the Consolidated 
Statement of the Results of the Count and the Final 
Consolidated Result sent to the Commission against proper 
receipt.  
(10) On receipt of documents under sub-section (8), the 
Commission shall, within fourteen days from the date of the 
poll, publish the documents on its website”.

13. 
Context of controversy: Defining context and scope of 
instant 
decision 
is 
essential 
to 
dispel 
post-decision 
misconceptions and to insulate parties-in-interest from 
misconceived 
assumptions, 
conjectured 
inferences 
and 
preconceived prejudices in the context of availability of 

 
13
statutory remedy for bringing election disputes before the 
Election Tribunal(s) under section 139 of the Elections Act, in 
line with the mandate of Article 225 of the Constitution.  
  
We are not deciding an “election dispute” nor same, in 
any manner and to any extent, is subject matter of present 
adjudication. 
Fundamentally 
the 
question 
posed 
for 
determination is the scope and extent of the jurisdiction vested 
in the Election Commission, after issuance of Notification of 
the Returned candidate under section 98 of the Elections Act – 
context being the specificity of remedy in terms of subsection 
(6) of section 95 of the Elections Act. 
14. 
Anatomy of submissions made and context thereof need 
a quick re-cap – to identify self-destructive pleas. Different 
provisions of Elections Act were, selectively and carefully 
picked, by each set of the counsels representing the parties, to 
support respective viewpoint without appreciating scope, 
relevance and applicability thereof in the context of this case. 
  
Learned counsel for the appellant largely borrowed 
support from clause (3) of Article 218 of Constitution and 
enabling provisions of Elections Act and Election Rules, with 
sharper focus on subsection (1) of section 9 of the Elections Act  
– when questioned that whether any declaration, as envisaged 
under referred section 9(1), ibid, was made by the Election 
Commission, learned counsel cautiously emphasized that order 
of 22.02.2024 [impugned through constitutional petition 
No.1333of 2024/BWP] was an interlocutory order and Election 
Commission retained seisin over the proceedings, initiated 
through application for recount of votes. This argument is 
ingeniously made to counter objection of maintainability of 
appeal – because if order of 22.02.2024 was treated as 
declaration issued under sub-section (1) of section 9 of the 
Elections Act, then instant appeal is hit by the proviso to sub-
section (2) of section 3 of the Ordinance – [statutory remedy of 
appeal was provided under subsection (5) of section 9 of 

 
14
Elections Act.] And in same breath, learned counsel for the 
appellant argued that since application for recount of votes, 
moved by the appellant was not decided by the Returning 
Officer, therefore, even otherwise remedy of review under 
clause (b) of section 8 of Elections Act was also not available. 
And 
learned 
counsel 
for 
respondent 
No.1 
contested 
maintainability of the appeal by referring to remedy of review 
under clause (b) of section 8 and appeal under subsection (5) of 
section 9 of the Elections Act without appreciating that if 
remedy under section 9(5) of Elections Act was available, why 
constitutional petition was filed by respondent No.1 and not 
appeal was preferred before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan, if at all jurisdiction exercised was covered under 
section 9(1) of Elections Act. Likewise, learned counsel for the 
Election Commission negated submissions of learned counsel 
for appellant – who futilely tried to convince us that order of 
22.02.2024 was manifestation of exercise of jurisdiction under 
section 9(1) of Elections Act. Learned counsel attempted to 
bring order of 22.02.2024 within the scope of powers under 
subsection (4) of section 9 of Elections Act – overlooking the 
fact that vide order of 22.02.2024 recount was directed, and 
neither poll was declared void, nor re-poll ordered.  
15. 
We repeatedly asked counsels representing Election 
Commission and appellant that under what authority of law / 
provision of Elections Act, Election Commission could direct 
recount of votes after declaration of retuned candidate was 
issued on 16.02.2024, in exercise of powers under section 98 of 
the Elections Act, learned counsels seek refuge behind 
subsection (3) of section 9 of the Elections Act and emphasized 
that notwithstanding the publication of name of returned 
candidate under section 98 of Elections Act, Commission may 
exercise powers conferred in terms of subsection (1) before the 
expiration of sixty days after such publication. Argument 
manifests conspicuous failure to appreciate scope and extent of 
powers envisaged under sections 8, 9 and 95 of the Elections 

 
15
Act, limitations prescribed for exercise of jurisdiction under 
each provision of law, timeframe provided for invoking 
variously available remedies and permissible outcome provided 
with respect to each of the remedy. Learned counsels 
misconstrued and over-stretched scope of each of the 
remedy(ies) and extent of jurisdiction, lawfully exercisable by 
Election Commission. Both learned counsels fail to appreciate 
ratio settled in the case of ‘Zulfikar Ali Bhatti’, wherein while 
dilating upon powers claimed under Article 218(3) of the 
Constitution, it was observed in paragraph 15 of the decision 
that,  
15 - However, where the law enacted by the Parliament does not 
cover an unforeseen matter or issue that may arise during the 
election process, the Election Commission its general power under 
Article 218(3) of the Constitution in the same manner as all other 
discretionary powers are exercised, that is, fairly, reasonably and 
judiciously in accordance with the principles of equity, justice and 
good conscience.  
16. Whether exercise of general power could be claimed in the 
context of request for recount of votes and especially when 
process of elections culminated upon publication of the name of 
returned candidate. 
17. 
Moot question for determination is true character of the 
order of 22.02.2024 and whether such order could be construed 
as an order passed in purported exercise of jurisdiction(s) under 
section 8(b) or section 9(1) of Elections Act. Question of 
maintainability poses a complex scenario in wake of diverse 
scope of proceedings envisaged under various provisions of the 
Elections Act and specific limitations/restraints docketed with 
each of those provisions – for the purposes of present 
controversy proceedings under subsection (5) of section 95 of 
the Elections Act are not in question but proceedings under sub-
section (6) of section 95 of the Elections Act. After hearing 
counsels and perusal of order of 22.02.2024, context of the 
application requesting Election Commission to direct recount of 
votes and scope of section 9(1) of the Elections Act, we are 
convinced that order of 22.02.2024 was not passed in exercise 

 
16
of jurisdiction under section 9 of Elections Act, reasons being, 
that firstly, when a specific remedy was provided before 
Election Commission and opted for seeking recount in terms of 
subsection (6) of section 95 of Elections Act. And in presence 
of specific timebound remedy, resort to general powers of 
Election Commissioner and invocation of jurisdiction under 
section 9(1) are unwarranted and manifest disregard of 
Elections Act. And secondly, equally significant, the probable 
outcome or causation of exercise of jurisdiction under section 
9(1) of Elections Act is not a direction, simplicitor, for recount 
of votes but, subject to the fulfillment of conditions, declaration 
to declare polls void and ordering of re-poll. In these 
circumstances, jurisdiction of Election Commission to direct 
recount of votes cannot be brought within the ambit of section 9 
of the Elections Act. There is another anomaly in the 
submissions of learned counsels for Election Commission and 
appellant. If power to direct recount is allowed or deemed 
permissible under section 9(1) of the Elections Act, it implies 
that such power would be exercised notwithstanding 
publication of name of returned candidate, till after sixty days 
of publication of name, which erroneous construction would 
then render timebound remedy of seeking recount of votes 
under subsection (6) of section 95 of Elections Act redundant – 
in terms of subsection (6) of section 95 of the Elections Act 
Commission could only direct recount of votes before the 
conclusion of consolidation proceedings and not after 
conclusion thereof.  
  
Hypothetically speaking, if power of the Election 
Commission to direct recount of votes is deemed or considered 
to be covered under section 9(1) of Elections Act, then such 
construction suggests that the option of seeking recount of votes 
could be sought even after conclusion of consolidation 
proceedings, when otherwise the recount of votes under 
subsection (6) of section 95 of Elections Act could be ordered 
before the conclusion of consolidation proceedings and not 

 
17
beyond that. Whether request for recount could be entertained, 
alternatively by resorting to remedy under section 9(1) of 
Elections Act? This is an apparent absurdity. Hence, claim of 
assumption 
and 
exercise 
of 
jurisdiction 
by 
Election 
Commission, to direct recount of votes by virtue of original 
order, purportedly under section 9 of Elections Act, is 
misconceived and is hereby, repelled. In these circumstances, 
no question of availability of remedy of appeal, under 
subsection (5) of section 9 of Elections Act against original 
order arises. 
18. 
Now, we take up the argument made by learned counsel 
for respondent No.1 that review was available under clause (b) 
of section 8 of the Elections Act, hence, instant appeal is not 
maintainable. In the first instance, learned counsel fails to 
convince us that order of 22.02.2024 manifests exercise of 
jurisdiction under section 8(b), ibid or proximity thereof to 
proceedings under subsection (5) of section 95 of Elections Act. 
Argument is rejected on two counts. Firstly, remedy(ies) 
provided in law for seeking recount of votes are diverse, one is 
before the Returning officer – explicitly in terms of subsection 
(5) of section 95 of the Elections Act – and other before the 
Election Commission under subsection (6) of section 95 of the 
Elections Act. Both remedies are independent, mutually 
exclusive and each exercisable in the context of the timelines 
prescribed, for the purposes of filing application and making of 
requisite direction. Evidently, application under subsection (5) 
of section 95 of the Elections Act can be filed with Returning 
officer, before the commencement of consolidation proceedings 
and application before Election Commission, in terms of 
subsection (6) of section 95 of the Elections Act, could, at best, 
be 
submitted 
before 
the 
conclusion 
of 
consolidation 
proceedings – since the discretion to decide such application 
ceases upon conclusion of consolidation. Secondly, perusal of 
application with Election Commission depicts that neither 
appellant had questioned alleged inaction on the part of 

 
18
Returning officer nor challenged decision of Returning officer, 
who had dismissed application on 10.02.2024, claimed to be 
received after dispatch of electoral material to Regional office 
of Election Commissioner - appellant’s case before us that no 
order was passed by the Returning Officer for recount in 
exercise of jurisdiction under sub-section (5) of section 95 of 
the Elections Act. For all intent and purposes application 
moved by appellant before Election Commission, on 
11.02.2024, was simplicitor request for recount of the votes, 
which proceedings are separate, independent and no remedy is 
available against any order passed by the Commission. 
Respondent No.1 fails to substantiate that application for 
recount of votes to the Election Commission was in fact an 
application seeking review of the order of the officer in terms of 
section 8(b) of Elections Act or said proceedings otherwise fall 
within the ambit of section 8 of Elections Act. This particular 
feature of the case distinguishes it from the case of SONIA 
RAZA (supra), wherein order of Returning officer, passed under 
subsection (5) of section 95 of Elections Act, was successfully 
challenged through the constitutional provision and question of 
maintainability of appeal arose in that context – which 
proceedings are distinct from proceedings subject matter of 
challenge before learned Single Judge in Chambers – arising 
out of subsection (6) of section 95 of Elections Act. 
19. 
There is another angle to this debate of maintainability of 
the appeal in the context of jurisdiction of the Election 
Commission to review the order of the Returning Officer under 
clause (b) of section 8 of the Elections Act. If the intention of 
the legislature was to subject proceedings of consolidation by 
providing remedy of review against the order of the Returning 
Officer – perceived interpretation of learned counsel for 
respondent No.1 – then some restraint on conclusion of 
consolidation by the Returning officer had to be provided to 
dilute the effect and mandate of sub-section (8) of section 95 of 
the Elections Act - which mandated the Returning Officer to 

 
19
send to the Commission signed copies of the Consolidated 
Statement of the Results of the Count and Final Consolidation 
Result along other material, as specified therein, within twenty 
four hours after the consolidation proceedings. Even otherwise 
section 8 of Elections Act starts with the phrase ‘save as 
otherwise provided, the Commission may….”, which suggests 
that assumption and exercise of jurisdiction by Election 
Commission under subsection (6) of section 95 of the Elections 
Act is unaffected by section 8 of Elections Act. In the case of 
SONIA RAZA (supra) protection extended to other provision of 
law under section 8 of the Elections Act was not appreciated, 
which aspect was dealt with in the case of ‘Zulfikar Ali Bhatti’, 
which relied upon the case of Bartha Ram V. Lala Mehar Lal 
Bheel and another (1995 SCMR 684) while explaining the 
import of “save as otherwise provided”. [Paragraph 18 is 
relevant] and is reproduced hereunder:- 
“Thus, we can safely conclude on the question of the status of 
the general power of the Election Commission under Article 
218(3) of the Constitution vis-à-vis a law enacted by the 
Parliament, that this power operates in the area uncovered by 
such law. Alike is the scope and applicability of the powers of 
the Election Commission under Section 8(c) of the Elections 
Act, which is also evident from the opening words of Section 
8, “Save as otherwise provided”. These words indicate that if 
something otherwise is provided in the Elections act, then this 
Section will not apply. Further, the amplitude of the power of 
the Election Commission under this Section, like its general 
power under Article 218(3), is extended to the performance of 
its executive duty to “conduct the election” and thus it can be 
exercised only at any stage of the election process, not after 
the completion thereof”. 
   
There is another aspect. If Election Commission cannot 
pass order of recount after conclusion of consolidation, how 
could it review the order, if any passed by Returning Officer 
under sub-section (5) of Section 95 of Elections Act. Even 
otherwise Section 8 extends general power to the Commission 
for ensuring fair elections. There appears no statutory bar on the 
Returning Officer to wait for the outcome of application, 
moved with the Election Commission for seeking review of the 
order of Returning Officer, unless and if so, restrained by the 

 
20
Election Commission. In this case even the application for 
recount with Election Commission was submitted after 
conclusion of consolidation proceedings. It is otherwise an 
absolute absurdity to assume and construe that power of recount 
could be exercised, be it the Returning Officer or Election 
Commission once consolidation of votes was completed – upon 
issuance of Form-49 – when electoral documents were 
dispatched to the Commissioner and notification for declaration 
of returned candidate was made under section 98 of the 
Elections Act. At that point in time, Election Commission, for 
the purposes of directing recount of votes, became divested of 
jurisdiction, otherwise available for recount of votes before the 
completion of consolidation proceedings. Hence, for the 
purposes of deciding the question of maintainability of appeal, 
we hold that proceedings, upon request for recount of votes, 
before the Election Commission were exclusively for seeking 
of recount of votes, having no bearing or connection with 
proceedings under section 8(b) of Elections Act.  
20. 
In view of this narrative, we reject the objection of 
maintainability of appeal on the premise that constitutional 
petition has actually arisen out of proceedings – under sub-
section (6) of section 95 of the Elections Act 2017 – which 
proceedings provided for no appeal, revision or review to any 
Court, Tribunal or Authority against the Original Order – being 
the order of 22.02.2024. 
21. 
Learned counsel for appellant has repeatedly referred to 
and read portions from correspondence(s) exchanged between 
Returning officer and Regional office of the Election 
Commissioner, we find lot many contradictions therein –
Returning Officer in letter of 10.02.2024 alleged that at the time 
of receipt of application electoral record of constituency NA-
154 had already been handed over to the office of Regional 
Election Commissioner, who took contrary stand exactly after 
six days, while submitting report dated 16.02.2024, where 
Returning officer spoke of receiving application before 

 
21
consolidation. We are unable to lay hands on any material that 
what prompted Returning officer to take summersault and rebut 
itself. It is otherwise evident that Returning Officer had 
dismissed application on 10.02.2024, observing that it was not 
maintainable because application for recount was filed after the 
commencement of consolidation proceedings. This dichotomy, 
which otherwise give rise to factual controversy, need not to be 
resolved since we are not deciding an election dispute, which is 
the domain of the Election Tribunal.  
22. 
Now we discuss the merits of appeal in the context of 
jurisdictional question raised. Both learned counsels have read 
and relied upon ratio settled in the case of ‘Zulfikar Ali Bhatti’. 
There is no cavil that decision in the case of ‘Zulfikar Ali 
Bhatti’ primarily dealt with the order of the Commission, 
ordering re-poll – passed in exercise of jurisdiction under 
section 9(1) of the Elections Act and that issue has no 
commonality with the present matter. Besides other issues, the 
judgment in the case of ‘Zulfikar Ali Bhatti’ emphatically 
settled scope of exercise of jurisdiction by the Election 
Commission after declaration of returned candidate(s), which 
observations were made in the context of powers claimed by 
Election Commission under Article 218(3) of the Constitution 
and section 8 (c) of Elections Act – paragraphs 19 and 20 of the 
judgment in the case of ‘Zulfikar Ali Bhatti’ are relevant for 
exposing misplaced reliance of the Election Commission on 
Article 218(3), ibid, while directing recount through order of 
22.02.2024. Paragraphs 19 and 20 of the case of Zulfiqar Ali 
Bhatti (supra) are reproduced hereunder:- 
In other words, we can say, the general power under Article 
218(3) of the Constitution and Section 8(c) of the Elections 
Act can be exercised by the Election Commission within two 
parameters: (i) during the election process, which starts with 
the issuance of the election programme and culminates with 
the publication of the name of the returned candidates in the 
official gazette, and (ii) when there is no express provision in 
the law enacted by the Parliament to deal with the matter or 
issue that arises during the performance of constitutional 

 
22
duty of conducting the elections honestly, justly, fairly and in 
accordance with law. 
Applicability of Article 218(3) of the Constitution and Section 
8(c) of the Elections Act to the present case  
In the present case, the Election Commission passed the 
impugned order after the consolidation of the final result of 
the poll by the Returning Officer under Section 95 and the 
publication of the name of the appellant as a returned 
candidate in the official gazette under Section 98 of the 
Elections Act, when the election process has been completed. 
*But as the notification of the appellant as a returned 
candidate had been issued under the interim order of this 
Court, the same could not have concluded the election 
process to create a bar on the exercise of its general power 
by the Election Commission under Article 218(3) of the 
Constitution read with Section 8(c) of the Elections Act. The 
objection that the Election Commission exercised its power in 
the present case after the completion of the election process 
is, therefore, not sustainable.”  
 
[Emphasis supplied] 
[*This is where facts and circumstances differ, because 
in the case of Zulfiqar Ali Bhatti notification was made 
on the direction of the court and in the case at hand it 
was issued by the Election Commission in discharge of 
obligations under section 98 of Elections Act.]  
23. 
 Case of Zulfiqar Ali Bhatti had affirmed illegality of any 
order of recount after publication of name of returned candidate 
under section 98 of Elections Act. We are constrained to 
observe that conduct of the Election Commission is 
mindboggling, which acknowledged factum of filing of 
application for the recount after conclusion of consolidation 
proceedings and proceeded to act as per the mandate of section 
98 of the Elections Act, and directed for publication of name of 
respondent No.1 as returned candidate through Notification on 
16.02.2024, thereafter made U-turn and, without ensuring 
sending of notice / intimation to respondent No.1 proceeded to 
allow application for recount, passed order of 22.02.2024. This 
volte-face exposes questionable conduct, besides being grossly 
violative of the mandate of Elections Law, per se. In brief, 
learned counsels for appellant and Election Commission failed 
to convince us that direction for recount of votes could be 

 
23
passed once consolidation proceedings had concluded and 
declaration of returned candidate had been made under section 
98 of the Elections Act.  
24. 
We concur with legal findings recorded in the impugned 
order, that in view of the facts and circumstances of instant 
matter, Election Commission erred in law while assuming and 
exercising jurisdiction, and directing recount of votes after 
conclusion of consolidation proceedings in violation of 
subsection (6) of section 95 of the Elections Act. Hence, we 
declare that assumption of jurisdiction, act of passing of 
original order and to withdraw the Notification dated 
16.02.2024, – issued to declare respondent No.1 as returned 
candidate and directing for publishing of his name, – after 
conclusion of consolidation proceedings were without any 
lawful authority. No illegality is shown or pointed out in the 
impugned order, calling for indulgence as appellate court. 
25. 
In view of aforesaid, this Intra Court Appeal is, hereby, 
dismissed, order of learned Single Judge-in-Chambers is 
affirmed, in light of the reasoning narrated hereinabove, and as 
an effect thereof, conditional Notification, dated 22.03.2024, is 
rendered ineffective and of no legal effect and Notification 
dated 16.02.2024 stands resurrected / effective, for all intent 
and purposes. Any observation made herein is solely for the 
purpose of deciding appeal and same would not prejudice the 
right of any party to invoke jurisdiction of the Election 
Tribunal, qua any election dispute.
