Ch. Rahmat Ali Memorial Trust 
 
VERSUS 
 
Lahore Development Authority and another

Respondents by: 
Mr. Sahibzada Muzaffar Ali, Advocate.

MUZAMIL AKHTAR SHABIR, J. Through this Intra 
Court Appeal filed under Section 3 of the Law Reforms Ordinance, 
1972, appellant (Ch. Rahmat Ali Memorial Trust) has called in 
question order dated 10.12.2020 passed by learned Single Judge of 
this Court whereby W.P. No. 121280 of 2017 filed by the appellant 
against order dated 17.11.2017 passed by Director Estate 
Management, L.D.A. was disposed of with direction to avail remedy 
of Arbitration in terms of lease agreement dated 10.02.1981 between 
the parties and in the meanwhile respondent L.D.A. was restrained 
from taking any coercive measures against appellant. 
2. 
Learned counsel for the appellant has argued that impugned 
order is not sustainable as on the one hand the learned Single Judge 
of this Court had held that the impugned termination notice was not 
sustainable and on the other hand instead of striking down the said 
termination notice had directed the appellant to avail alternate 
remedy against the same. It is further claimed that it had not been 

I.C.A. No. 9534 of 2021 
2 
 
appreciated by learned Single Judge of this Court that registered 
lease deed in favour of appellant cannot be unilaterally terminated 
by the respondent, furthermore, it was Government that had leased 
out the land to the appellant, therefore, L.D.A., which was 
subordinate authority, cannot cancel the same in view of principles 
laid down in judgment reported as “Messrs Mustafa Impex, Karachi 
and others Vs. The Government of Pakistan through Secretary 
Finance, Islamabad and others” (PLD 2016 SC 808). 
3. 
On the other hand, learned counsel appearing on behalf of 
respondent-L.D.A. has defended the impugned order by stating that 
L.D.A., being successor of Housing and Physical Planning 
Department, is representing the said department which, through the 
District Housing Officer, Lahore Township Scheme, had earlier 
awarded lease of land to the appellant and due to non-compliance of 
conditions mentioned in the lease agreement, L.D.A. was well 
within its jurisdiction and had justification to cancel the lease in 
favour of respondents. 
4. 
We have heard the arguments of both the parties and gone 
through the record with their able assistance. 
5. 
Appellant had challenged order dated 17.11.2017 passed by 
Director Estate Management, L.D.A. through which in terms of 
Clause 14 of lease agreement dated 10.02.1981 executed in favour 
of appellant by the Government, lease in favour of appellant had 
been terminated, which clause is reproduced below: 
 
“14. 
Provided always and it is hereby expressly agreed that 
the lease may be terminated by Government at any time for breach of 
any condition of this agreement, and it shall be lawful for the 
Government in housing and Physical Planning Department (Punjab) or 
any officer authorized on his behalf to enter into and upon the land to 
obtain possession of the same and of all such buildings, erections and 
materials as may then be found upon the land for the absolute use of 
Government; and thereupon the agreement, so far as it relates to the 
engagement of Government’s shall be void. Compensation for the 
buildings shall be determined by Deputy Commissioner Lahore and his 
decision shall be final and binding on the lessee.”

6. 
The impugned order dated 17.11.2017 for termination of lease 
issued by Director Estate Management (QAT), L.D.A. passed in 
terms of afore-referred Clause 14 is reproduced below: 
“To 
The Secretary General, 
Ch. Rehmat Ali Memorial Trust (Regd), 
45, Civic Centre, 
Quaid-e-Azam Town, Lahore. 
 
SUBJECT:- 
TERMINATION OF LEASE AGREEMENT EXECUTED 
 
 
WITH H&PP DEPARTMENT ON 10-2-1981. 
 
 
The lease agreement executed with Ch. Rehmat Ali Memorial Trust 
(Regd), by the District Housing Officer, Lahore Township Scheme on 10-2-
1981, in respect of lease of 26.43 acres land bearing plot No.45 Civic Centre, 
Quaid-e-Azam Town, for establishment of Hospital, is hereby terminated in 
light of clause 14 of the aforementioned lease agreement on account of failure 
of Ch. Rehmat Ali Memorial Trust (Regd) to comply with the directions of the 
Director 
General, 
LDA 
passed 
vide 
order 
bearing 
No.LDA/PS 
/DG/DEM(QAT)/7299 dt. 29.11.2016. 
 
 
DIRECTOR ESTATE MANAGEMENT (QAT) 
LDA” 
 
7. 
The afore-referred order shows that the lease in favour of the 
appellant had been terminated on account of failure of the appellant 
to comply with directions earlier issued by Director General, L.D.A. 
through his order dated 29.11.2016. Although, appellant had claimed 
that through another order passed by D.G., L.D.A. prior to aforesaid 
date, the allegation of subletting property, subject matter of lease, 
against the appellant relating to breach of terms of lease agreement 
had been withdrawn and the default, if any, had been condoned, 
therefore, there was no reason for L.D.A. to unilaterally terminate 
the contract of appellant without specifying any reason, yet the said 
aspect of the matter, arising from non-compliance of order dated 
29.11.2016, appears to be apparently based on different cause of 
action; hence, whether compliance of previous orders would amount 
to discharge of subsequent direction/demand by the D.G. L.D.A. 
could not be determined in constitutional jurisdiction of this Court, 
especially when the lease agreement dated 10.02.1981, which has 
been terminated through impugned order dated 17.11.2017, provides 
for Arbitration Clause where parties can approach the Arbitrator for 
resolution of their dispute, which even otherwise requires 
determination of disputed facts and beyond the powers to be 

I.C.A. No. 9534 of 2021 
4 
 
exercised in constitutional jurisdiction of this Court as it is settled by 
now that disputed questions of fact cannot be looked into in 
Constitutional Petition as the same require recording of evidence. 
Reliance is placed upon judgments reported as “Amir Jamal and 
others Vs. Malik Zahoor-Ul-Haq and others” (2011 SCMR 1023), 
“Fida Hussain and another Vs. Mst. Saiqa and others” (2011 
SCMR 1990) and “Sheikh Muhammad Sadiq Vs. Elahi Bakhsh and 
2 others” (2006 SCMR 12).  
8. 
Moreover, alternate remedy of arbitration is available to the 
appellant under Clause No.17 of the lease agreement dated 
10.02.1981 which is reproduced below: 
 
“17.  If any question, difference or objection, whatsoever, shall 
arise in any way connected with or arising out of this instrument or the 
meaning or operation of any part thereof or the rights, duties or 
liabilities of either party, then save in so far as the decision of any such 
matter is hereinbefore provided for and has been so decided, every such 
matter including the question whether its decision has been otherwise 
provided for, and or whether it has been finally decided accordingly, or 
whether the lease should be terminated or has been rightly terminated 
and as regards the rights and obligation of the parties as the result of 
such termination shall be referred for arbitration to the Commissioner 
of the Lahore Division and his decision shall be final and binding and 
where the matter involves a claim for or the payment or recovery or 
deduction of money, only the amount, if any, awarded in such 
arbitration shall be recoverable in respect of the matter so referred.” 
 
9. 
The perusal of afore-referred Clause 17 shows that the 
question, whether the lease should be terminated or has rightly been 
terminated and what are the rights and obligations of the parties as 
result of such termination are to be determined by arbitration 
through Commissioner Lahore Division whose decision would be 
final. Having agreed to afore-referred clause, the appellant cannot 
wriggle out of the arbitration proceedings merely by stating that 
arbitration proceedings are not in terms of the arbitration clause 
mentioned above for the reason that the parties could not be allowed 
to approbate and reprobate and having themselves agreed to have the 
matter decided through arbitration while entering into the lease 
agreement, the appellant could not be later on allowed to take a 
contradictory stand. For this purpose, reliance may be placed on 
principles laid down in judgment reported as “Sardar Ali Khan Vs. 

I.C.A. No. 9534 of 2021 
5 
 
State Bank of Pakistan and others” (2022 SCMR 1454) wherein it is 
provided as under: 
 
“The maxim qui approbat non-reprobat (one who approbates 
cannot reprobate) is firmly embodied in English common law. It is 
akin to the doctrine of benefits and burdens which at its most basic 
level provides that a person taking advantage under an instrument 
which both grants a benefit and imposes a burden cannot take the 
former without complying with the latter. A person cannot approbate 
and reprobate or accept and reject the same instrument.” 
 
 
In support of afore-referred principles reliance may also be 
placed upon judgment reported as “Divisional Superintendent Postal 
Services Faisalabad and others Vs. Khalid Mahmood and others” 
(2023 SCMR 354) wherein it is laid down as under: 
 
“7.    It is somewhat strange and astonishing for us that the 
petitioners have assailed the judgment of the learned Tribunal which 
was simply disposed of with the concurrence of the petitioners on the 
basis of their comments, and nothing was decided by the Tribunal, 
except recording the consensual statement made in the comments. 
The factual position encapsulated in the comments cannot be 
challenged by the petitioners due to their acquiescence that the 
services of the respondents (employees) have been regularized and 
their Service books have also been verified with a further promise to 
pay arrears on the availability of funds, hence at this stage the 
petitioners' plea is also hit by the doctrine of approbate and 
reprobate, which means to approve and disapprove. This doctrine is 
founded on the maxim 'quod approbo non reprobo' which translates 
to "that which I approve, I cannot disapprove". It is also known as 
principle of equitable doctrine of election.” 
 
 10. 
Main grievance raised by the appellant is that termination of 
lease of property where hospital has been constructed will result in 
irreparable loss to the appellant as the appellant is running said 
institute/hospital on the basis of donations which would no longer be 
available as donors would not donate for an institution which has 
lost its substratum due to cancellation of lease, hence, this exercise 
would cause irreparable loss to the appellants, however, we have 
noticed that learned Single Judge of this Court has taken into 
consideration all the afore-referred aspects of the matter and passed 
the order to settle the matter between the parties through Arbitration 
in terms of the lease agreement and in the meanwhile restrained the 
respondents to adopt any coercive measures or take possession of 
property from the appellant, operative part of which is reproduced as 
under: 

I.C.A. No. 9534 of 2021 
6 
 
 
“However, since the petitioner has a remedy to apply for 
arbitration, it must do so under the terms of the lease agreement. This 
petition is disposed of with a direction that the petitioner may approach 
the arbitrator under the terms of lease agreement for resolution of the 
dispute regarding termination of lease agreement. Till the time the 
arbitration is decided by the arbitrator LDA shall not take any coercive 
measures against the petitioner nor will it try to take possession of the 
property in question. ”  
 
 
11. 
The Arbitrator appointed under the Arbitration Act, 1940 
while determining the dispute referred to him has the authority to 
determine all the legal questions arising out of the lease agreement 
including question of validity of the said agreement, maintainability 
of Arbitration proceedings, proper and necessary parties to the said 
proceedings, legality of termination order, etc. which is well within 
its jurisdiction in view of judgments reported as “Gerry’s 
International (Pvt.) Ltd. Vs. Aeroflot Russian International Airlines” 
(2018 SCMR 662), wherein it is provided as under: 
“(1)        When a claim or matters in dispute are referred to an arbitrator, 
he is the sole and final Judge of all questions, both of law and of 
fact. 
(2)        The arbitrator alone is the judge of the quality as well as the 
quantity of evidence.” 
 
12. 
The rights of the appellant have sufficiently been protected by 
the learned Single Judge by observing that respondents in the 
meanwhile shall not adopt any coercive measures or take possession 
of the property from the appellant, hence, no prejudice has been 
caused to the appellant by observations made in the impugned order 
dated 10.12.2020 passed by learned Single Judge of this Court and 
as appellant’s rights have been protected by the said order whereby 
it has been directed to avail alternate remedy of arbitration provided 
under the law instead of insisting upon seeking relief through 
Constitutional jurisdiction of this Court which, as was held by the 
Apex Court, is barred in the wake of availability of an alternate and 
efficacious remedy to a litigant under the law.  Reliance is placed on 
“Province of Punjab through Secretary Communication and Works 
Department, Lahore through Chief Engineer (North/Central) Punjab  
Highway Department, Lahore  v. Yasir Majeed Sheikh and others” 
(2021 SCMR 624), “Federation of Pakistan through Secretary 
Establishment Division, Islamabad v. Shafqat-ur-Rehman Ranjha 

I.C.A. No. 9534 of 2021 
7 
 
and others” (2021 SCMR 153), “Indus Trading and Contracting 
Company v. Collector of Customs (Preventive) Karachi and others” 
(2016 SCMR 842), “Dr. Sher Afgan Khan Niazi v. Ali S. Habib and 
others” (2011 SCMR 1813) and “Muhammad Abbasi v. S.H.O. 
Bhara Kahu and 7 others” (PLD 2010 SC 969). 
13. 
In view of what has been discussed above, there is no 
illegality or jurisdictional defect in the well-reasoned impugned 
order passed by learned Single Judge for this Court to warrant 
interference. Hence, this appeal being devoid of merits is dismissed.
