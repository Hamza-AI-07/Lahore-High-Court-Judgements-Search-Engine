Muhammad Amjad Rafiq, J:- This appeal against acquittal 
filed by the State questions the impugned judgment dated 06.01.2020 
passed by Additional Sessions Judge/CNS Court/MCTC Sadiq Abad, 
District Rahim Yar Khan whereby Shafique Ahmed, accused/ 
respondent was acquitted under section 265-K Cr.P.C., in case FIR 
No.758 dated 05.11.2019 under section 9-C of the Control of Narcotic 
Substance Act, 1997, Police Station City Sadiq Aabad, Rahim Yar Khan 
on the ground that PFSA Analysis Report, though not tendered in 
evidence, is bereft of necessary protocols.  
2.    
Number of judgments of learned trial Courts are under challenge 
before this Court wherein accused(s) were acquitted under section         
265-K of Cr.P.C. (the Code) on the ground that Narcotic Analysis 
Report does not contain protocols as required under Rule-6 of Control 
of Narcotic Substance (Government Analyst) Rules, 2001 (Government 
Analyst Rules, 2001) which are mandatory pursuant to dictum laid 
down by Hon’ble Supreme Court in cases reported as “The STATE 
through Regional Director ANF Versus IMAM BAKHSH and others” (2018 
SCMR 2039) & “KHAIR-UL-BASHAR Versus The STATE” (2019 
SCMR 930). Learned Deputy Prosecutor General states that in both 

                               Crl. Appeal No.166 of 2020                                                                   2 
 
cited cases, Supreme Court of Pakistan passed the judgment of acquittal 
while hearing appeals filed by the accused against their convictions, 
and request made by the prosecution, for summoning of analyst or                  
re-examination of recovered contraband so as to produce additional 
evidence, was not acceded to while considering it as an attempt to fill 
the lacuna. Whereas in the present case evidence had yet not been 
recorded nor analyst report was tendered in evidence. Further states that 
in Imam Bakhsh & Khair-ul-Bashir Cases supra, report of Chemical 
examiner in old style was part of evidence wherein no protocols were 
mentioned but in the present case protocols are very much part of PFSA 
Analysis Report which format was found by the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court in number of cases as sufficient to fulfill the requirement of Rule-
6 of Government Analyst Rules, 2001. He placed reliance in this regard 
on case reported as “ASMAT ALI Versus The STATE” (2020 SCMR 1000).  
3.    
 Despite notice, the respondent/accused is not in attendance, 
therefore, this appeal cannot be kept in wait, nor proceedings u/s 512 of 
the Code are required at appellate stage as held in case reported as 
“HAYAT BAKHSH AND OTHERS Vs. THE STATE” (1981 SCMR 1) 
(Equivalent citation PLD 1981 SC 265); further, appeal against 
acquittal can be decided even in the absence of accused as per section 
423 of the Code; relevant part is reproduced:- 
423. Powers of Appellate Court in disposing of appeal: (1) The 
Appellate Court shall then send for the record, of the case, if such 
record is not already in Court. After perusing such record, and 
hearing the appellant or his pleader, if he appears and the Public 
Prosecutor, if he appears, and in case of an appeal under Section 
411-A, sub-section (2) or Section 417, the accused, if he appears, 
the Court may, if it considers that there is no sufficient ground for 
interfering, dismiss the appeal, or may--- 
(a)  
in an appeal from an order of acquittal, reverse such 
order and direct that further inquiry be made, or that 
the accused be retried or sent for trial to the Court of 
Session or the High Court as the case may be, or find 
him guilty and pass sentence on him according to 
law;  
 
Under the principle of Audi alteram partem, notice for hearing is 
necessary as per section 422 of the Code and thereafter power under 
section 423 of the Code becomes available to the Court. Plain reading 

                               Crl. Appeal No.166 of 2020                                                                   3 
 
of above section explains that if the appellant or his counsel appear in 
appeal against conviction, the Court would provide him opportunity of 
hearing and to the Public Prosecutor but it is not mandatory for the 
Court to hear the appellant in an appeal against acquittal but must hear 
the accused, if he appears. Non-appearance of accused does not 
restrict the Court to decide the appeal in his absence.  The Honourable 
Supreme Court in the case cited supra as “HAYAT BAKHSH AND OTHERS 
Vs. THE STATE” (1981 SCMR 1) has explained the scope of hearing of 
appeal against acquittal in the absence of accused; relevant excerpt is 
as under:- 
“Reliance of the learned counsel on the provisions contained in 
section 512, Cr. P. C. is of not much help in this behalf. While the 
present controversy relates to the hearing of or otherwise 
determination of an appeal, section 512, Cr. P. C. deals with trials. 
Moreover, the said provision is not attracted to the form and 
procedure of this Court. It would not be possible at all to adjourn 
an appeal against acquittal even against a single acquitted 
accused/absconding respondent, for an indefinite period, 
although the office of the Court would make efforts to secure his 
surrender or arrest in obedience to the process of the Court, for 
a reasonable period before fixing the appeal for hearing; and if 
he remains fugitive, the Court would proceed to determine the 
appeal in his absence. If after examination of the case the 
acquittal merits to be reversed, there would be no impediment 
to decide the appeal accordingly, but in case the judgment of 
acquittal merits to be maintained, the same would not be 
reversed 
on 
account 
of 
the 
abscondence 
of 
the 
accused/respondent. This would apply to both the situations 
whether the appeal is against one acquitted or more. The submission 
of the learned counsel that while dealing with the controversy the 
Court should keep in view its power to do complete justice is 
undoubtedly weighty, but as already indicated, this power is 
concomitant with the power of the Court to pass such orders as are 
necessary for the ends of justice and also for the prevention of the 
abuse of the process of the Court. These aspects of rendering justice 
cannot be visualized and considered in isolated water tight 
compartments. They have to be put in juxtaposition because they 
react upon each other and that is the only course to keep the stream 
of justice flowing, uninterrupted and unsullied”. 
 
                                                                                                              [Emphasis supplied] 
Fortified with above view, the Court cannot dawdle on the dillydallies 
of respondent/accused in appearing before the Court, and this appeal 
against acquittal cannot be kept in wait for indefinite period, it is, 
therefore decided accordingly while hearing the learned DPG and after 
perusal of record.  
4.    
The present case for recovery of Charas weighing 1080-grams 

                               Crl. Appeal No.166 of 2020                                                                   4 
 
from the accused was decided on 06.01.2020 and before that pursuant 
to direction of Supreme Court, in Imam Bakhash & Khair-ul-Bashir 
Cases supra, the Punjab Forensic Science Agency started issuing 
reports while mentioning required protocols. However, later a 
format/template for report of analyst was suggested by the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court in case reported as “QAISER JAVED KHAN Versus The 
STATE through Prosecutor General Punjab, Lahore and another” (PLD 
2020 Supreme Court 57) like as under; 
 
 
 
The PFSA Analysis Report in the present case did contain such 
information including protocols but not in a style/format/template as 
suggested later in Qaiser Javed Khan Case supra, yet the report-format 
used by PFSA was also considered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in 
number of cases as sufficient to fulfill the requirement of Rule-6 of 
Government Analyst Rules, 2001. Cases reported as “SHAZIA BIBI 
Versus The STATE” (2020 SCMR 460); “MUSHTAQ AHMAD Versus The 
STATE and another” (2020 SCMR 474) are referred; and in case reported 
as “ASMAT ALI Versus The STATE” (2020 SCMR 1000) it was held as 
under; 
“Alleged insufficiency of "protocol" mentioned in the forensic 
report is beside the mark; it conclusively establishes the narcotic 
character of the substance with sufficient details regarding the test 
carried out” 
Even otherwise pursuant to case reported as “MINHAJ KHAN Versus The 
STATE” (2019 SCMR 326), a three members’ Hon’ble Bench of the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan has expressed concern over the mandatory 
form of Rule-6 of Government Analyst Rules, 2001 which judgment 
though was discussed in case reported as “QAISER JAVED KHAN Versus 
The STATE through Prosecutor General Punjab, Lahore and another” 
(PLD 2020 Supreme Court 57)  supra  but the same question was also 
pending in number of cases, therefore, in Criminal Appeals                     
No. 43/2020 & Criminal Petition. No. 131/2018 titled Baz Khan & 
Baidullah Versus The State through PG Baluchistan & The State 
Test Applied  Protocols (applied to carry out the test) 
Result of the test (s) 
 
 
 

                               Crl. Appeal No.166 of 2020                                                                   5 
 
through Deputy Attorney General, a larger Bench of Supreme Court 
of Pakistan has been constituted and by virtue of order dated 
16.09.2020, four learned Advocates of Supreme Court (ASC) & DG 
Punjab Forensic Science Agency were appointed as amicus curie; 
matter is yet pending.  
5.      What is the actual requirement of Rule-6 of Government Analyst 
Rules, 2001 is yet to be decided finally by the Honourable Supreme 
Court, therefore, to see what it runs like, it is given below:- 
“After test or analysis, the result thereof together with full protocols 
of the test applied, shall be signed in quadruplicate and supplied 
forthwith 
to 
the 
sender 
as 
specified 
in 
Form-II”.                        
 
 
 
 
                          (emphasis supplied) 
 
Perusal of above Rule and Form-II transpire that the use of words 
“test or analysis” is meaningful; though both words sometimes used 
interchangeably yet maintain subtle difference due to which 
connotation is changed. Section 36 of Control of Narcotic Substances 
Act, 1997 (CNSA, 1997) talks about test and analysis of contrabands in 
the manner as may be prescribed. Therefore, it was prescribed through 
Government Analyst Rules, 2001 made under section 77 of CNSA, 
1997 and perusal of Rule-6 of Government Analyst Rules, 2001 & 
Form-II throws light that an analyst shall either conduct test or analyze 
the contrabands. As per preamble read with section 6, 7 & 8 of CNSA, 
1997, contraband is not limited to narcotic drug only rather there are 
three types of contrabands; Narcotic Drug, Psychotropic Substance and 
Controlled Substance which show that their identification either require 
test or analysis. For proper explanation, it is referred that CNSA, 1997 
deals with certain prohibitions as under; 
1.  Prohibition of Possession etc.(section-6) 
2.  Prohibition of Import or export (Section-7) 
3.  Prohibition on trafficking or financing the trafficking (Section-8) 
Prohibition focuses on following three types of contrabands:- 
i. 
Narcotic Drug   
ii. 
Psychotropic substance  
iii. 
Controlled substance  

                               Crl. Appeal No.166 of 2020                                                                   6 
 
These contrabands are defined in Section-2(s) & 2(za) & 2(k), of 
CNSA, 1997 respectively as under:-  
Section-2(s) “narcotic drug” means 
coca leaf, cannabis, heroin, opium, poppy straw and all 
manufactured drugs; 
Narcotic drug does include ‘manufactured drugs’ therefore, its definition is 
mentioned in section 2(q) as under; 
    “manufactured drug” includes: - 
(i) all coca derivatives, medicinal hemp, opium derivatives, 
cannabis in any form and any mixture of stalks and flowering or 
fruiting tops of the Indian hemp plant (cannabis sativa L.) Acetic 
anhydride; and 
(ii) any other narcotic substance which the Federal government may, 
by notification in the official Gazette made in pursuance of 
recommendations of any International Convention or otherwise, 
declare to be a manufactured drug; 
Section-2 (Za) “psychotropic substance” means 
the substances, specified in the Schedule to this Act and such 
substances as the Federal Government may, by notification in the 
official Gazette, declare to be a psychotropic substance; 
Section-2 (k) “controlled substance” means 
any substance which may be used for the production or manufacture 
of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substance; 
 
6.           For the identification, Quantification, Purity Analysis, 
Adulterant Detection, and its confirmation with regulations, every 
contraband requires examination and proper inspection that can either 
be done through naked eye with spot testing including other like 
methods, or through microscopic analysis with the help of scientific 
equipment/machines which is also evident from a “Manual For Use By 
National Law Enforcement and Narcotics Laboratory Personnel”  
written at New York in year 1994 for ‘RAPID TESTING METHODS OF 
DRUGS OF ABUSE’, under the auspices of United Nations International 
Drug Control Programme, Viena, wherein for different kinds of 
contrabands, a series of tests are prescribed; like for “Cannabis”, Fast 
Blue B Salt Test and Duquenois-Levine Test, is suggested. Similarly, 
for “Morphine, Codeine and Heroin”, Marquis Test, Mecke Test, 
Nitric Acid Test & Ferric Sulfate Test; for “Opium”, Marquis Test & 
Ferric Sulfate Test; for “Cocaine”, Cobalt Thiocyanate Test, Modified 

                               Crl. Appeal No.166 of 2020                                                                   7 
 
Cobalt Thiocyanate Test (Scott Test), Methyl Benzoate Test & Wagner 
Test. On the same go, for other narcotic drugs various tests are in 
practice. These tests are simply done by placing small amount of 
suspected material on a Spot Plate while adding required reagents. Such 
tests are regarded as field test for which no sophisticated equipment is 
required and they can be conducted by using a spot plate, test tubes, 
filter papers, test stripes or pre-measured and pre-packaged reagents in 
a test container (ampoules). It is told that only the colour (s) indicated 
for each test should be interpreted as a positive result and in any case 
means only the possible presence of the substance (s) for which the test 
is intended.  In the said manual, it is mentioned that although Colour 
tests are used worldwide in the laboratories for screening purposes, they 
are not substitute of more specific identification techniques such as 
chromatography and spectroscopy. Rather they should be used in a 
logical combination with these techniques.      
7.        On go of above information, it depends upon the nature of 
contraband and demand of prosecution as to whether, test be conducted 
or the analysis be preferred. However, generally for identification and 
calculation of percentage in any material containing controlled 
substance or psychotropic substance a deep microscopic analysis is 
required, whereas a narcotic drug can even be identified through a 
presumptive test. That is the reason three types of tests mentioned in 
PFSA report in the present case like, (i) Analytical balance for weight 
(ii) Chemical Spot Test (iii) Gas Chromatography-mass spectrometry, 
are of international standards as cited above and were considered 
sufficient by the Supreme Court in number of cases, only for narcotic 
drugs. The cases reported “SHAZIA BIBI Versus The STATE” (2020 
SCMR 460); “MUSHTAQ AHMAD Versus The STATE and another” (2020 
SCMR 474) & “ASMAT ALI Versus The STATE” (2020 SCMR 1000) are 
referred and the protocols demanded as per judgments reported as “The 
STATE through Regional Director ANF Versus IMAM BAKHSH and others” 
(2018 SCMR 2039); “KHAIR-UL-BASHAR Versus The STATE” (2019 
SCMR 930);  & “QAISER JAVED KHAN Versus The STATE through 
Prosecutor General Punjab, Lahore and another” (PLD 2020 Supreme 

                               Crl. Appeal No.166 of 2020                                                                   8 
 
Court 57) are also in the same line.  
8.     Perusal of PFSA Analysis Report, reproduced in impugned 
judgment, shows that test applied, protocols carried out and result of 
test was mentioned. For clarity it is reproduced here as well:- 
Internationally Recommended (Scientific Working Group for the 
Analysis of seized Drugs – SWGDRUG & United Nations Office on 
Drugs and Crimes – UNODC) full test protocols performed on received 
Item(s) of Evidence 
1. Analytical balance was used to weighing where net weight of the 
Evidence is 62.42 gram(s). 
 
2. Chemical Spot Test(s) was/were used for presumptive testing. 
Suspected sample(s) and standard drug (s) were added, separately, in 
test tubes (or reaction plate wells) after the addition of respective 
reagent(s) in each tube/plate and noted the change in color. Positive 
result for suspected sample may produce similar color change as that of 
standard. Result of presumptive test indicated possible presence of 
Charas. 
 
 
3. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used for confirmation 
where Helium (carrier gas) was used with DB-SMS column using 
electron impact ionization on scan mode. For positive results, standard 
drug(s) and sample of suspected drug(s) extracted in organic solvent 
produce same chromatogram(s) and mass spectrum. Result of 
confirmatory test confirmed presence of Charas.” 
Although said report was in the form as considered sufficient by the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court in judgments cited in preceding paragraph but 
the trial Court has rejected this report that no details of protocols 
performed for tests are mentioned therein. 
9.       Contours of section 265-K of the Code connotes no probability 
of conviction in any offence, it is reproduced as under:- 
265-K. Power of Court to acquit accused at any stage: Nothing 
in this Chapter shall be deemed to prevent a Court from acquitting 
an accused at any stage of the case, if, after hearing the prosecutor 
and the accused and for reasons to be recorded, it considers that there 
is not probability of the accused being convicted of any offence.     
                                                                          (emphasis supplied) 
 
The word “any offence” means that even if offence is not mentioned in 
the charge which interpretation stands in conformity with section 237 
& 238 of the Code based on the principle that “no offence should go 
unchecked and no offender should go unpunished’ but in this case even 
charge had not been framed. Possession of Charas is also an offence 

                               Crl. Appeal No.166 of 2020                                                                   9 
 
under Article 4 of the Prohibition (Enforcement of Hadd) Order, 1979, 
therefore, offender can be tried under such Order if the requirement of 
section 36 of CNSA, 1997 read with Rule-6 of Government Analyst 
Rules, 2001 is not fulfilled because section 73 of CNSA, 1997 saves 
the prevailing Provincial and Special laws. In a case reported as 
“PRESIDENT NATIONAL BANK OF PAKISTAN and others Versus 
WAQAS AHMED KHAN” (2023 SCMR 766); the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court has deprecated the practice of pre-mature termination of 
prosecution; relevant part is referred below; 
 
“It is settled law that even if the allegations levelled in the FIR 
are admitted to be false, even then without recording of evidence, 
it cannot be said that there was no probability of conviction of the 
accused. In order to ascertain the genuineness of the allegations, 
the Trial Court ought to have allowed the prosecution to lead 
evidence. Even otherwise, this Court in Model Customs 
Collectorate, Islamabad v. Aamir Mumtaz Qureshi (2022 SCMR 
1861) and State v. Raja Abdul Rehman (2005 SCMR 1544) has 
categorically held that in appellate or revisional proceedings, the 
same sanctity cannot be accorded to acquittal at intermediately 
stage such as under section 249-A or 265-K, Cr.P.C. as available 
for those recorded and based on full-fledged trial after recording 
of evidence.” 
 
 More so learned trial court has not focused on the philosophy behind 
“probability of conviction”. Section 265-K of the Code does not say 
about strong or less probability, it is a complete theme and not mere a 
word; what probability connotes in law is defined in case reported as 
“Raja MUHAMMAD YASIN Versus ZAITOON BEGUM and others” (1993 CLC 
2448), as under;  
 
“Circumstantial deduction reaching "probability" is a mental 
cognition which leads to "supposition' regarding existence of a fact. 
This the law permits as an alternative to positive "belief" in its 
existence, “probability" is not lower than "likelihood": which is 
higher than a mere possibility, a surmise or a conjecture. And it is 
not a very difficult task to distinguish a "probability" from 
conjecture and even possibility. Thus, the Courts when applying 
some artificial rules of appreciation of evidence, which do not form 
part of statutory guidance, must also attach due and purposeful 
importance to the above aspect of a statutory mandate. It will be of 
some advantage to conclude this by reproducing from Monir's Law 
of Evidence (1974 Edition, page 27)". The authors of the Evidence 
Act in their wisdom did not mention the term "evidence" while 
defining the words "proved" and "disproved"; evidence means only 
statements and documents. The Court is therefore not bound to look 

                               Crl. Appeal No.166 of 2020                                                                   10 
 
for its findings on the "evidence" alone as defined in the Evidence 
Act, but has to see to the high probabilities regarding the existence 
or non-existence of a fact after considering "the matters before the 
Court". 
Learned Deputy Prosecutor General has rightly said that if the report of 
PFSA was not amenable to be used as cogent evidence, prosecution still 
had some options to be exercised like calling of analyst pursuant to 
section 510 of Cr.P.C., and for re-examination of contraband or 
clarification of report as per section 11 & 12 of the Punjab Forensic 
Science Agency Act, 2007.  
10.         Keeping in view the above facts, the learned trial court has 
erred in law while passing the judgment of acquittal in hasty manner 
and created a room for premature termination of prosecution while 
anticipating the evidentiary value of PFSA Analysis Report which even 
had not been tendered in evidence. Consequently, impugned judgment 
dated 06.01.2020 is set aside, and on the strength of section 423 of the 
Code, the cases is sent back to the Court concerned for trial of the 
accused/respondent in accordance with law.
