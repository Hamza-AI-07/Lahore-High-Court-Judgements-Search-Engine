Advocate.

 RASAAL HASAN SYED, J. Petitioner filed a 
suit to preempt the sale of land reflected through 
sale deed dated 23.2.2008 on the plea of having 
superior right of preemption which was contested 
and ultimately dismissed by the learned Civil Judge 
vide judgment and decree dated 06.1.2016. 
Petitioner’s appeal  thereagainst also met the same 
fate vide judgment dated 30.4.2018 of the learned 
Addl. District Judge which judgments are now 
under challenge in this revision petition. 
2. 
Facts necessary for the disposal of this 
petition are that the petitioner filed a suit  to 
preempt the sale of land measuring 80 kanals 
purchased by respondents vide sale deed bearing 
document No. 884 claiming that the sale was made

in a secret manner, the actual sale price was 
Rs.1,49,59,375/-  which was fictionally shown  as 
Rs. 2,50,00,000/-  and that the factum of sale came 
to the knowledge of preemptor on 05.3.2008 at 
5.00 p.m. when Irshad Ullah came to the 
petitioner’s dera “Khoh Burj Wala”, Mandranwala,  
Tehsil Daska and that the petitioner having superior 
right of preemption immediately made jumping 
demand to preempt the sale whereafter notices of 
Talb-e-Ishhad were sent which were received by 
the respondents and that the petitioner having 
superior right of preemption being Shafi Sharik, 
Shafi Khaleet and Shafi Jar was entitled to preempt 
the sale as against the respondents.  
3. 
Suit was resisted both on legal and factual 
premises. Issues were framed and parties led oral 
and documentary evidence. On considering the 
submissions made pro and contra in light of the 
evidence 
adduced 
the 
learned 
Civil 
Judge 
dismissed the suit on the ground that superior right 
of preemption could not be proved,  requisite Talbs 
could not be established in accordance with law 
and that the price given in the sale deed could not 
be proved to be fictional. This was vide judgment 
and decree dated 06.1.2016. Petitioner’s appeal 
thereagainst also ended in dismissal vide judgment 

 
 
 
 
   
           C.R. No.220345 of 2018 
 
 
          Page-3 
 
 
 
dated  30.4.2018 by the learned Addl. District 
Judge, Daska.   
4. 
Main stance of the learned counsel for the 
petitioner was that the evidence on record was 
misconstrued  and misread by the courts below and 
that the petitioner had proved the requisite Talbs 
and that the superior right of preemption was also 
proved beyond any iota of doubt. Learned counsel 
for the respondents on the other hand supported the 
judgments of the courts below and requested for 
dismissal of the revision petition. 
5. 
Petitioner’s claim for superior right of 
preemption was on counts of being co-sharer in the 
khata, of contiguity of land and common source of 
irrigation. The learned Civil Judge recorded 
findings to the effect that the petitioner could not 
prove to be co-sharer in the khata as such he could 
not claim to be Shafi Sharik. This finding was 
based on the admission of the petitioner in his 
statement as P.W.4 to the effect that he did not own 
land in the same khata. The findings on the plea of 
Shafi Khaleet and Shafi Jar were also recorded 
against the petitioner. In regard to the Talbs it was 
observed that the petitioner could not prove Talb-e-
Muwathibat by any credible and independent 
evidence and that the evidence on the question of 

 
 
 
 
   
           C.R. No.220345 of 2018 
 
 
          Page-4 
 
 
 
Talb-e-Ishhad was also contradictory and deficient. 
In appeal the learned Addl. District Judge affirmed 
the findings as to non-existence of the qualifications 
of Shafi Sharik, Shafi Khaleet but modified the 
findings of the learned Civil Judge in regard to the 
qualification of Shafi Jar and it was held that the 
petitioner’s property and the suit property had 
common source of irrigation and, therefore, 
petitioner was found to have the superior right of 
preemption. 
6. 
It may be gleaned from the appended 
documents that findings of the courts below in the 
matter of Talbs are concurrent inasmuch as it was 
observed that the petitioner did not mention in the 
plaint the specific place of knowledge of sale or 
making of Talb-e-Muwathibat and that there was 
no independent evidence and that the source of 
knowledge claimed from petitioner’s own son, 
namely, Irshad Ullah was not creditworthy and also 
that the statements made by witnesses P.W.5 to 
P.W.7 added to being hearsay in nature.  
 
 
7. 
Scrutiny of the pleadings and evidence on 
the file shows that petitioner’s stance in the plaint 
was that his son Irshad Ullah visited him at his dera 
“Khoh Burj Wala” at 5:00 p.m. on 05.3.2008 and 
disclosed that the land adjacent to the petitioner’s 

 
 
 
 
   
           C.R. No.220345 of 2018 
 
 
          Page-5 
 
 
 
had been sold at which the petitioner spontaneously 
proclaimed his intention of exercising right of 
preemption which was followed by notice of Talb-
e-Ishhad. In his examination-in-chief as P.W.4 
petitioner deposed that Irshad Ullah came to his 
dera “Khoh Burj Wala”, Mandranwala Tehsil, 
Daska and disclosed about the sale when he 
immediately announced his right of preemption as 
co-sharer in the khata with common passage and 
source of irrigation. Later on 10.3.2008 he sent 
notices of Talb-e-Ishhad. In his cross-examination 
he stated that his dera comprised a godown, 
courtyard, a room, cattle-shed and pond, etc. and 
that the total area of the dera was 2 to 3 kanals and 
that he was sitting in the courtyard when Irshad 
Ullah approached him and disclosed about the sale 
and that on his query as to where his son had 
acquired the knowledge, he disclosed it to be from 
one Shabbir Hussain Cheema who told him the 
price to be Rs.1,50,00,000/-. Evidently, these facts 
were not stated in the plaint or in petitioner’s 
examination-in-chief. It is settled rule that 
mentioning of date, time and place in the plaint qua 
Talb-e-Muwathibat in a suit for preemption is a 
condition precedent in the context of subsection 3 
of section 13 of the of the Punjab Preemption Act, 

 
 
 
 
   
           C.R. No.220345 of 2018 
 
 
          Page-6 
 
 
 
1991 and that in the absence of such specification 
of date, time and place, the period for making Talb-
e-Ishhad cannot be calculated with required 
accuracy. Reference can be made to the case of 
Haq Nawaz v. Muhammad Kabir (2009 SCMR 
630), Mian Pir Muhammad v. Faqir Muhammad 
(PLD 2007 SC 302) and Muhammad Akram and 
another v. Ghulam Sarwar (2013 MLD 1662).  
8. 
Irshad Ullah the real son of the petitioner 
who was claimed to be an informer, appeared as 
P.W.5. In his statement-in-chief he did not specify  
the actual place where he divulged the information 
about the alleged communication of factum of sale 
or as to where the alleged Talb-e-Muwathibat was 
made. Perusal of the statement as a whole leaves no 
manner of doubt that his account was hearsay as in 
his cross-examination he admitted that he had not 
seen the sale deed till the date of his deposition and 
that he was told by one Shabbir Hussain Cheema 
about the sale and that he came to know about the 
date of sale deed when Shahbaz Munshi came after 
getting the particulars of sale and that he did not 
accompany Shahbaz Munshi for the said purpose 
and that about the price he came to know from 
Shabbir Hussain Cheema who stated to Irshad 
Ullah that the land was sold for Rs.1,50,00,000/-. 

 
 
 
 
   
           C.R. No.220345 of 2018 
 
 
          Page-7 
 
 
 
P.W.5 Irshad Ullah expressed lack of knowledge as 
to whether Shabbir Hussain Cheema was present at 
the occasion of the sale deed itself or at the office 
of Registrar, Daska. He further deposed that 
Shabbir Hussain Cheema did not reveal to him his 
source of information about the asserted sale price 
to infer its inflatedness. Shabbir Hussain Cheema 
appeared as P.W.7 and in his examination-in-chief 
deposed that he had told Irshad Ullah about the 
sale. On being asked about his source of knowledge 
of the sale he claimed that it was from Sardar 
Mustafa, father of the respondents. It is also 
discernable that there was no independent evidence 
and neither was Irshad Ullah, the claimed informer, 
either witness of the sale itself nor did he claim to 
be present at the time of transaction. Rather he was 
deposing hearsay from Shabbir Hussain Cheema 
P.W.7. None of the witnesses was, as such, 
evidently present at the time of sale. So much so 
that Shahbaz Munshi made a statement that he 
came to know about the sale from one Sardar 
Mustafa, father of the respondents, who had not 
been produced in the witness-box to confirm the 
chain of claim made by the three witnesses.  
9. 
Be that as it may, the petitioner did not 
disclose the actual site where the alleged 

 
 
 
 
   
           C.R. No.220345 of 2018 
 
 
          Page-8 
 
 
 
information was passed nor could the informer 
prove his credibility by claiming direct knowledge 
of the sale itself but instead recorded a hearsay  
account of little probative value. In these 
circumstances the courts below correctly observed 
that the statement of Irshad Ullah, real son of 
petitioner, was not worthy of consideration. Both 
the courts below, therefore, justifiably disbelieved 
the evidence and declared that Talb-e-Muwathibat 
could not be proved.  
10. 
Same is the case of Talb-e-Ishhad which 
could not be proved. In this context the petitioner 
produced the Registry Clerk as P.W.2 and 
Muhammad 
Farooq 
Postman 
as 
P.W.3.            
P.W.2 admitted that he had not brought the relevant 
record with him and during cross-examination 
admitted that the date, month and year and name of 
Post Office was not visible on Exh.P-3 and     
Exh.P-4.  He also admitted that the same was not 
issued by him and that the receipts did not carry the 
name of signatory. P.W.3 claimed that notices of 
Talb-e-Ishhad No. 960 to 964 were delivered to 
defendant No. 2 which meant that he failed to 
discharge his duty by delivering the same to the 
respective recipients/purchasers.

          Page-9 
 
 
 
11. 
In view of the evidence the conclusion 
drawn was that notice of Talb-e-Ishhad was not 
proved, therefore, the petitioner failed to prove the 
requisite Talbs. Findings of the courts below do not 
suffer from any misreading and non-reading of 
evidence and no ground for interference is made 
out. 
12. 
Resultantly 
the 
revision 
petition 
is 
dismissed.
