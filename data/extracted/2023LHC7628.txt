07.12.2023 Ch. Khursheed Anwar Bhinder, Advocate, assisted by Mr. 
Imran Qadir Bhinder, Advocate, for the petitioner. 
 
Mr. Zain Qazi, Assistant Attorney General, with Shafique 
Ahmad Bhatti/Inspector FIA. 
 
Barrister Muhammad Momin Malik, amicus curiae. 
 
 
 
Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – Through this application, the 
petitioner seeks post-arrest in case FIR No.354/2023 dated 7.9.2023 
registered at Police Station FIA, Gujranwala, for an offence under 
section 18 of the Emigration Ordinance, 1979 read with section 6 of 
Passport Act, 1974 and sections 34/109 PPC. 
2. 
 
According to the crime report, the prosecution’s case is 
that the Federal Investigating Agency (FIA) received source 
information that a group of people were involved in human trafficking. 
They had established an illegal set-up and prepared counterfeit travel 
documents for various European countries. Acting on this tip-off, the 
Deputy Director of FIA constituted a raiding party led by Inspector 
Shafique Ahmad Bhatti (hereinafter referred to as the “Complainant”), 
which raided a house in Lane No.4, Sialkot Road, Gujranwala, on 
7.9.2023, around 3:30 a.m. The Complainant apprehended the 
petitioner and another individual with fake foreign passports, foreign 
driving licences, computers, printers, scanners and other machines, 
counterfeit stamps, visa stickers, monograms, and other articles. The 
petitioner applied for post-arrest bail before the Special Court  
Central-I, Gujranwala, but that was declined. 
3. 
 
Ch. Khursheed Anwar Bhinder, Advocate, contends that 
the Petitioner is innocent and has been falsely implicated in this case. 
According to him, he was not arrested at the scene, and the Complainant 
made him a scapegoat after releasing the actual culprits. Mr. Bhinder 

Crl. Misc. No.72452/B/2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 
 
 
 
further contends that the FIA’s actions were unlawful, emphasizing that 
they did not obtain any warrant for search and seizure from any court. 
Additionally, he points out that they did not involve any inhabitants 
from the locality during the raid. Finally, Mr. Bhinder argues that the 
offence under section 18 of the Emigration Ordinance is not attracted 
to the facts of the case. In contrast, the offence under section 6 of the 
Passport Act, 1974, carries a maximum punishment of three years 
imprisonment or a fine and thus does not fall within the prohibitory 
clause of section 497 Cr.P.C. 
4. 
 
Mr. Zain Qazi, Assistant Attorney General, has 
controverted the above contentions. He argues that the petitioner was 
caught red-handed while actively involved in the preparation of 
counterfeit documents. He maintains that the accusation of false 
implication is unfounded. He submits that the FIA conducted the raid 
lawfully, and no objection can be raised against it. 
5. 
 
This Court appointed Barrister Muhammad Momin Malik 
as amicus curiae in this case to assist in determining whether the FIA 
is obligated to obtain search and arrest warrants from the court or a 
competent authority before searching a dwelling house. If so, whether 
the proceedings or seizures resulting from such searches would be 
vitiated in the absence of search warrants. Mr. Malik has argued that 
the Federal Investigation Agency Act, 1974 (the “FIA Act”) empowers 
the FIA to search and arrest persons and seize property throughout 
Pakistan. According to him, any irregularities or illegalities in the 
search or arrest process do not invalidate the proceedings unless they 
have caused serious prejudice to the accused. 
6. 
 
I have heard the learned counsel and examined the record.  
7. 
 
Parliament has established FIA through the Federal 
Investigation Agency Act of 1974 for inquiry and investigation of 
certain offences committed in connection with matters concerning the 
Federal Government.1 Section 3 of the Act, read with the Schedule 
thereto, lists those offences and adds that it would include an attempt

or conspiracy to commit any such offence and the abetment thereof. 
Section 4(2) stipulates that administration of the FIA shall vest in the 
Director General, who shall have the same powers as the Inspector 
General of Police under the Police Act, 1861. Section 5 of the FIA Act 
describes the powers of the members of the FIA.  
8. 
 
Section 5(1) stipulates that, unless otherwise ordered by 
the Federal Government, members of the FIA shall possess, throughout 
Pakistan, powers related to search, arrest of persons, and seizure of 
property for an inquiry or investigation under the FIA Act. These 
powers, duties, privileges, and liabilities are akin to those of provincial 
police officers in relation to the investigation of offences under the 
Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 or any other law for the time being 
in force. Section 5(2) states that subject to rules, a member of the FIA 
not below the rank of a Sub-Inspector may exercise powers equivalent 
to those of an officer-in-charge of a police station in the area where they 
are currently stationed for the purpose of any inquiry or investigation 
under the Act. Section 5(3) empowers FIA members, not below the rank 
of a Sub-Inspector and authorized by the Director-General, to arrest 
without a warrant any person suspected of committing offences referred 
to in section 3(1) of the Act. Section 5(5) states that if, in the opinion 
of a member of the FIA conducting an investigation, any property 
relevant to the investigation is likely to be removed, transferred, or 
disposed of before obtaining an order for its seizure from the 
appropriate authority, that member can, through a written order, direct 
the owner or current possessor not to take such actions without his prior 
permission, and such order shall be subject to any order made by the 
court having jurisdiction in the matter. Section 5(6) mandates that 
contravention of an order issued under section 5(5) is punishable by 
rigorous imprisonment for up to one year, a fine, or both. 
9. 
 
The Sindh High Court considered section 5(5) of the FIA 
Act in Najib Rahim v. Federation of Pakistan and others  
(PLD 2017 Sindh 53) and observed that it has four elements:  
(i) the property has some nexus with the investigation/alleged offence; 
(ii) there is a likelihood that the property will be removed, transferred, 

Crl. Misc. No.72452/B/2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4 
 
 
 
or otherwise disposed of before an order for its seizure is obtained from 
the appropriate authority; (iii) issuing a written order directing the 
owner or any person in possession at the time not to remove, transfer, 
or otherwise dispose of the property; and (iv) the order shall be subject 
to any order made by the court having jurisdiction in the matter. 
10. 
 
The legislature has used two terms in section 5 of the FIA 
Act, i.e. “inquiry” and “investigation”, without providing specific 
definitions. 
While 
these 
terms 
are 
commonly 
considered 
interchangeable, they carry distinct meanings in the legal context.2  
In Adamjee Insurance Company Ltd. v. Assistant Director, Economic 
Enquiry Wing (1989 PCr.LJ 1921), a Divisional Bench of the Sindh 
High Court stated that the above-mentioned two terms “connote two 
different meanings. In our view, inquiry can be termed as the first step 
towards investigation.”  
11. 
 
It is crucial to note that the powers granted by section 5(5) 
of the FIA Act are applicable exclusively during an investigation and 
do not extend to the inquiry stage. Furthermore, the FIA is empowered 
to invoke section 5(5) in urgent situations where the officer is genuinely 
of the opinion that the property which is the subject matter of the 
investigation is likely to be removed, transferred, or otherwise disposed 
of before an order for its seizure is obtained from the appropriate 
authority. According to Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary of Law,3 
“opinion” connotes “a belief stronger than impression and less strong 
positive knowledge.” In Ray v. City of Philadelphia, 25 A.2d 145, 344 
Pa. 439 (1942), it was held that “an ‘opinion’ creates no fact but is what 
someone thinks about something and the thought may be accurate or 
inaccurate and yet represent the honest conviction of person expressing 
it.” In Northeastern Gas Transmission Co. v. Benedict, 89 A.2d 379, 
139 Conn. 36, the court held that “an ‘opinion’ is a belief less strong 
                                                 
2 The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, defines the two terms as follows in section 4(1):  
(k)  
“Inquiry”.– “Inquiry” includes every inquiry other than a trial conducted under this Code by a 
Magistrate or Court.  
(l)  
“Investigation”.– “Investigation” includes all the proceedings under this Code for the collection of 
evidence conducted by a police- officer or by any person (other than a Magistrate) who is authorized by a 
Magistrate in this behalf.

than positive knowledge and the forming of the opinion, therefore, 
ordinarily involves the exercise of discretion in determining the weight 
to be given to various conflicting considerations.” In Dolgobinda 
Paricha v. Nimai Charan Misra (AIR 1959 SC 914), the Indian 
Supreme Court stated that the word “opinion in section 50 of the Indian 
Evidence Act means something more than mere retailing of gossip or 
hearsay; it means judgment or belief, that is, a belief or a conviction 
resulting from what one thinks on a particular question.” In  
Star Rolling Mills v. C.I.T. (1974 PTD 200), the Sindh High Court held 
that “an opinion on the basis whereof a statutory authority is entitled or 
empowered to take any action or initiate any legal proceedings, may be 
accurate or erroneous, but it must be an honest opinion or conviction, 
based on tangible material capable of sustaining such opinion, and not 
a mala fide opinion or a colourable exercise of statutory power.”4 
12. 
 
The phrase “in the opinion of'” is generally considered to 
convey a less stringent implication than the term “satisfied”. In  
Barium Chemicals Ltd. and another v. Company Law Board and 
others (AIR 1967 SC 295), it was noted: 
“The words ‘in the opinion of the Central Government’ in section 
237 (b) [of the Companies Act 1956] indicate that the opinion must 
be formed by the Central Government and it is of course implicit 
that the opinion must be an honest opinion. The next requirement is 
that ‘there are circumstances suggesting etc.’ These words indicate 
that before the Central Government forms its opinion, it must have 
before it circumstances suggesting certain inferences.” 
13. 
 
In view of the above, an officer claiming authority under 
section 5(5) of the FIA Act does not have unfettered powers. He must 
act in good faith and refrain from arbitrary actions. There must be 
circumstances justifying the necessity for swift intervention. 
Furthermore, the property sought to be seized should have a  
nexus with the investigation of the alleged offence. In Khawaja 
Muhammad Sharif v. Federation of Pakistan and others (PLD 1988 
Lahore 725), a Larger Bench of this Court underscored that an order is 
without lawful authority when an action is taken, or power is exercised, 
                                                 
4 Cited with approval by a Larger Bench of the Lahore High Court in Khawaja Muhammad Sharif v. Federation of 
Pakistan and others (PLD 1988 Lahore 725).

without any basis or beyond the power conferred, or for extraneous 
considerations, or when impermissible factors are taken into account. 
14. 
 
To assert jurisdiction under section 5(5) of the FIA Act, 
the officer concerned must document the facts and reasons in the case 
diary (to the extent possible), laying the foundation for his 
decision/opinion. 
15. 
 
The FIA is obligated to follow the procedure set out in 
Chapter VII of the Code of Criminal Procedure to search the premises 
unless it is exercising powers under a special law which prescribes 
some other procedure. Notably, under section 96 Cr.P.C., a court may 
issue a search warrant for any inquiry, trial or other proceedings.  
16. 
 
Violations of Chapter VII of the Code and section 5(5) of 
the FIA Act are frequent and sometimes encroach upon the guarantees 
under Articles 4, 9, and 24(1) of the Constitution of 1973. Since the 
proceedings under section 5(5) of the FIA are subject to confirmation 
by the court of competent jurisdiction, any person aggrieved by such 
proceedings may seek redress before that court. If the officer concerned 
of the FIA is found to have committed any misconduct, legal action can 
be initiated against them under the relevant laws, and they may also 
face disciplinary action within the department. However, a lingering 
question remains: Where the property is seized as a result of an illegal 
raid or the powers are not exercised in accordance with section 5(5) of 
the FIA Act, what would be the effect of such illegality or irregularity 
on the fate of the case? 
17. 
 
In Kuruma v. R. [1955 AC 197 : (1955) 1 All ER 236 : 
(1955) 2 WLR 223 (PC)], the Privy Council held that the crucial 
criterion for determining the admissibility of evidence is whether it is 
relevant to the matters in issue. If the evidence is relevant, it is 
admissible, and the court does not delve into how it was procured. This 
principle holds for both civil and criminal cases. However, in criminal 
cases, the judge retains the discretion to exclude evidence if strict 
admissibility rules would prejudice the accused. 
18.  
 
India follows the rule established by the Privy Council in 
Kuruma v. R. (supra). Evidence obtained illegally or improperly is not 

Crl. Misc. No.72452/B/2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7 
 
 
 
per se inadmissible. If the violation committed by the investigating 
authority is of a serious nature and causes serious prejudice to the 
accused, such evidence may be excluded. In Radhakishan v. State of 
U.P. [1963 Supp (1) SCR 408: AIR 1963 SC 822: (1963) 1 Cri LJ 809], 
Justice Mudholkar, speaking for a three-member Bench, stated: 
“So far as the alleged illegality of the search is concerned it is 
sufficient to say that even assuming that the search was illegal the 
seizure of the articles is not vitiated. It may be that where the 
provisions of Sections 103 and 165 of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure are contravened the search could be resisted by the person 
whose premises are sought to be searched. It may also be that 
because of the illegality of the search the Court may be inclined to 
examine carefully the evidence regarding the seizure. But beyond 
these two consequences, no further consequence ensues.” 
19.  
 
In 
Pooran 
Mal 
v. 
Director 
of 
Inspection  
[(1974) 1 SCC 345 : 1974 SCC (Tax) 114], the Constitution Bench of 
the Indian Supreme Court held that India’s law of evidence is modelled 
on the principles of evidence which prevailed in English law. Courts in 
both India and England have consistently rejected the exclusion of 
relevant evidence solely because it is acquired through illegal search or 
seizure. The test of admissibility of evidence lies in relevancy. Unless 
there is an express or necessarily implied prohibition in the Constitution 
or other law, evidence obtained as a result of an illegal search or seizure 
is not liable to be excluded. 
20. 
 
In Dr. Partap Singh v. Director of Enforcement 
[(1985) 3 SCC 72 : 1985 SCC (Cri) 312 : 1985 SCC (Tax) 352], the 
Supreme Court emphasized that the legality in the method, manner, or 
initiation of a search does not necessarily mean that anything seized 
during the search has to be returned. Items or documents seized during 
a search may serve as evidence. The Supreme Court further stated: 
“Illegality of search does not vitiate the evidence collected during 
such illegal search. The only requirement is that the court or the 
authority before which such material or evidence seized during the 
search shown to be illegal, is placed has to be cautious and 
circumspect in dealing with such evidence or material. This is too 
well-established to necessitate its substantiation by a precedent.” 
21. 
 
The courts in India consider the powers of searches and 
seizure as incidental to the investigative process. Hence, the notion that 
every search operation should necessarily result in the discovery of 
incriminating material is unfounded. There may be instances where a 

Crl. Misc. No.72452/B/2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8 
 
 
 
search fails to produce evidence, or there might be a plausible 
explanation for certain documents. In I.T.O. v. Seth Brothers  
[(1969) 2 SCC 324], the Indian Supreme Court clarified that the 
presence of non-useful or irrelevant documents among those seized 
during a search does not invalidate the search, nor does it imply that the 
initial exercise of power was malicious. In Pooran Mal’s case, the 
Supreme Court held that the subsequent determination that books of 
account and other documents collected during a search were irrelevant 
does not render the search and seizure illegal. 
22. 
 
In Pakistan, the case of Bisvil Spinners (Pvt.) Ltd. v. 
Pakistan through the Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Islamabad, and 
others (PLD 1992 SC 96) is considered seminal.5 The company was 
accused of clearing excisable woollen yarn without paying the 
prescribed duty. Legal action ensued, during which the Deputy 
Collector Customs found it guilty of violating excise laws and rules, 
determining that it was liable for a duty exceeding two lakhs of rupees. 
One of the contentions before the Supreme Court of Pakistan was that 
the documents on the basis of which the company was held guilty had 
not been obtained lawfully. Consequently, they were deemed 
inadmissible as evidence and could not be used against it. The Supreme 
Court of Pakistan held: 
“We do not accept as valid the argument that the evidence, in the 
form of documents recovered (or obtained) from the petitioner, 
could not be examined or relied upon because allegedly certain 
formalities were not observed in taking them into possession. If 
otherwise relevant and reliable, there was nothing wrong in using it 
against the petitioner.” 
23. 
 
In Justice Qazi Faez Isa and others v. President of 
Pakistan and others (PLD 2022 SC 119), the Supreme Court ruled that 
the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, governs the admissibility of evidence. 
According to Article 18 of this law, the criterion is whether the evidence 
is relevant to the facts in issue. Therefore, unless there is an express or 
necessarily implied prohibition in the Constitution or other laws, 
evidence obtained through illegal search or seizure is not liable to be 
                                                 
5 This case was cited with approval in Muhammad Ijaz Ahmad Chaudhry v. Mumtaz Ahmad Tarar and others  
(2016 SCMR 1), and Justice Qazi Faez Isa and others v. President of Pakistan and others (PLD 2022 SC 119). 

Crl. Misc. No.72452/B/2023

excluded. Ordinarily, the same principle applies in both civil and 
criminal proceedings. The Supreme Court also delved into legal 
precedents from various jurisdictions, including Pakistan, India, the 
United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and the Privy Council, and stated: 
“A perusal of these cases and laws demonstrates that in both 
criminal and civil matters either there is no bar to the admission of 
evidence collected by any means [except for the absolute 
prohibitions enshrined in the Constitution such as the protection 
against self-incrimination (Article 13(b)), the inviolability of dignity 
of man (Article 14(1)) and the prohibition of torture for the purpose 
of extracting evidence (Article 14(2)] as long as it is relevant and 
genuine (Pakistan, UK, Privy Council and India) or a balancing 
exercise needs to be carried out by the Courts to determine the 
admissibility of the disputed evidence (Canada and Australia). 
However, in neither of these countries is there an absolute bar to the 
admission of illegally collected evidence.” 
The Supreme Court further stated: 
“In contrast, the United States follows what is known as the 
exclusionary rule which outrightly prohibits the admission of 
evidence collected via an illegal search and seizure. The rationale 
behind this strict approach is the Fourth Amendment to the 
Constitution ... The United States by virtue of the Constitutional 
command in the Fourth Amendment is one of the strongest 
proponents of the exclusionary rule. Yet it has not transposed the 
approach of excluding illegal evidence to civil proceedings; and in 
criminal matters, has qualified the severity of the rule due to its 
adverse effect on discovering the truth. There is no reason why in 
our jurisdiction where there is no such Constitutional or statutory 
obligation to exclude illegally collected evidence, the said rule 
should be adopted mechanically.” 
24. 
 
In Fida Jan v. The State (2001 SCMR 36), a three-
member Bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan held that the 
provisions of section 20 of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 
1997, are of a directory nature. If a raid is conducted without obtaining 
a search warrant, the trial would not be vitiated on this ground alone. In 
a parallel context, in State through A.-G, Sindh, Karachi v. Hemjoo 
(2003 SCMR 881), another three-member Bench of the Supreme Court 
dealing with the CNSA held that in exceptional cases where obtaining 
a search warrant before conducting a raid is impractical, an authorized 
officer can proceed with the raid without a warrant. However, the Court 
underscored that this power should not be exercised in every case under 
normal 
circumstances. 
A 
similar 
view 
was 
expressed 
in  
Arshad Mahmood v. The State (PLD 2008 SC 376) and Syed Zulfiqar 
Shah v. The State (2022 SCMR 1450).

Nevertheless, our judicial system insists that tax 
authorities strictly follow the legal procedure for conducting searches. 
The courts have consistently held that carrying out raids on taxpayers’ 
premises by tax authorities without obtaining permission from a 
magistrate and without providing reasons for the claim of an emergency 
is illegal. The case reported as Collector of Sales Tax and Central 
Excise (Enforcement) and another v. Mega Tech (Pvt) Limited  
(2005 SCMR 1166) is illustrative. In the said case, following an 
anonymous complaint regarding sales tax evasion, an authorized officer 
from the Sales Tax Department visited the company’s premises along 
with his subordinates. The company allegedly refused their request for 
records. The Deputy Collector of Sales Tax then invoked section 40-A 
of the Sales Tax Act 1990, seizing numerous documents from the 
company’s office, including box files, bank statements, and annual 
statement files. The next day, various items such as documents, 
computers, diskettes, and CDs were also impounded from the 
company’s godown. The company challenged the legality of the 
actions, alleging mala fide intentions and a blatant violation of the law 
because the Sales Tax Department had proceeded without prior notice 
or obtaining a search warrant from a magistrate. The High Court 
declared the actions illegal and directed the restoration of seized 
records. It held that the impugned action occurred after a lapse of two 
days, which was sufficient time to obtain a search warrant from the 
magistrate if the Department believed the complaint was genuine. The 
High Court doubted the bona fides of the Department in bypassing 
section 40 of the Act and straightaway assuming extraordinary powers 
under section 40A. The Supreme Court dismissed the Department’s 
appeal, holding: 
“At any rate, it is not apparent from the statement prepared by the 
authorized officer that it was his genuine belief that there was 
reasonable danger of removal of records, which may be relevant to 
any proceedings under the Act. In the absence of any strong belief 
to such effect, it is difficult to agree with the submission that section 
40-A confers unlimited and unbridled powers on the authorized 
officer to conduct a search or to impound any kind of documents 
without any reasonable cause and without obtaining any search 
warrant from the magistrate.”

26. 
 
A reference may also be made to Federation of Pakistan 
and others v. Master Enterprises (Pvt) Ltd. (2003 PTD 1034) in which 
the Supreme Court refused to grant leave against an order of the Sindh 
High Court striking down the Sales Tax Department’s action in 
circumstances similar to those mentioned in the preceding paragraph.6 
27. 
 
In several instances, the courts have directed Customs 
authorities to return records seized through an unlawful raid. A 
pertinent example in this context is S. M. Yousuf and others v. 
Collector of Customs and others (PLD 1968 Karachi 599). 
28. 
 
I conclude that criminal cases falling within the ambit of 
the FIA Act are notably different from those under the purview of tax 
authorities. As such, they must be dealt with distinctively. In these 
matters, the principles established by the Supreme Court in Justice Qazi 
Faez Isa’s case apply. 
29. 
 
In the present case, the petitioner does not dispute the 
FIA’s jurisdiction over offences under the Passport Act 1974 and the 
Emigration Ordinance 1979. He contends that the Complainant, 
Inspector Shafique Ahmad Bhatti, and his squad raided the house 
without a search and seizure warrant. It is, however, noted that the FIA 
conducted that raid on 7.9.2023 at around 3:30 a.m. based on source 
information. No court was available at that time to which the 
Complainant could apply for a search warrant. Considering the urgency 
involved, any procedural irregularities or illegalities in the process 
should be condoned, especially when the petitioner has not alleged any 
malice on the Complainant’s part or any member of his team. 
Nonetheless, the petitioner may demonstrate during the trial if the 
actions caused him any prejudice. 
30. 
 
The petitioner’s next objection is that the Complainant 
violated section 103 Cr.P.C. while conducting the raid. According to 
him, he did not associate any inhabitant from the locality with the 
proceedings. There is a plethora of case law that police witnesses are as 
                                                 
6 Also see: Ihsan Yousaf Textile Mills (Pvt) Ltd. v. Federation of Pakistan and others (2003 PTD 2037), Megna Textiles 
Mills v. Collector of Customs (2004 PTD 1339), Food Consults (Pvt) Ltd. and others v. Collector (Central Excise & 
Sales Tax), Lahore, and others (2004 PTD 1731).

good as any other witness from the general public unless they have any 
animosity towards the accused and have a motive to implicate him 
falsely.7 With this observation, I move on. The petitioner may show 
cause at the trial why the above-mentioned proceedings cannot be relied 
upon.  
31. 
 
According to the prosecution, an FIA team apprehended 
the petitioner on the spot with fake foreign passports, foreign driving 
licences, computers, printers, scanners and other machines, counterfeit 
stamps, visa stickers, monograms and other articles (detailed in the 
FIR). Prima facie, the ingredients of the offences under section 18 of 
the Emigration Ordinance 1979, and section 6 of the Passport Act 1974 
are satisfied. Section 18, ibid, falls in the prohibitory clause of section 
497 Cr.P.C.  
32.
