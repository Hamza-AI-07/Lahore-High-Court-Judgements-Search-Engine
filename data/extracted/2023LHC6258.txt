Rasaal Hasan Syed, J. The petitioners in this civil 
revision have challenged the judgments and decree of the 
courts below whereby their suit for declaration with 
consequential relief was dismissed by the learned Civil Judge  
on 02.3.2011 which judgment was affirmed in appeal by 
learned Addl. District Judge vide judgment dated 31.1.2012. 
2. 
Facts from which the instant case stems are that the 
petitioners instituted a suit for declaration to challenge 
mutation Nos. 133 and 206 dated 27.5.2005 claiming that the 
same were a result of connivance with the revenue staff and 
that late Ghulam Nabi their paternal uncle was suffering from 
paralysis and was mentally incapacitated because of this 
condition from differentiating between right and wrong and 
that he was bedridden on account of his illness and remained 
so for about 3½ years and that during his prolonged illness 
mutations were got attested against his consent. Suit was

resisted, issues were framed and evidence recorded. 
Petitioners Zareena Kausar and Samina Kausar appeared as 
P.W.1 and P.W.2 and also produced three other witnesses in 
their support as P.W.3 to P.W.5. Respondent No.1 appeared 
as D.W.1 and produced D.W.2 and D.W.3 to fortify her 
stance. She also tendered in evidence documents Ex.D-1 to 
Ex.D-4. On considering the evidence and submissions pro and 
contra the learned Civil Judge dismissed the suit while 
concluding that the petitioners failed to produce any medical 
evidence in support of the allegations of serious illness and 
mental incapacity allegedly suffered by the deceased Ghulam 
Nabi before his death nor could they establish their case by 
any credible evidence. In appeal the learned Addl. District 
Judge duly reexamined the entire evidence and affirmed the 
findings recorded by the Trial Court.

4. 
From the narrative given supra it is manifest that in 
their suit for declaration with consequential relief the 
petitioners claimed that late Ghulam Nabi son of Abdul Ghani 
owned land measuring 21 kanals, 18 marlas in khata No.52, 
khatuni No. 96/97 in Mauza Nehal Garh, Tehsil and District 
Narowal as per register haqdaran for the year 1999-2000; that 
he also owned land measuring 05 kanals, 09 marlas in khata 
No.45, khatuni No.100 as per register haqdaran for the year 
1999-2000 in Mauza Bhattian Devan, Tehsil and District 
Narowal which  land on his death devolved upon the 

C.R. No.661 of 2012  
 
 
 
 
Page-3 
 
 
 
petitioners and respondent Nos. 2 to 6  and respondent No.1 to 
the extent of 3/4th and 1/4th shares respectively. It was asserted 
that late Ghulam Nabi was paternal uncle of petitioners and 
maternal uncle of respondent Nos. 2 to 6 while respondent 
No.1/Mst. Nasreen Bibi was his widow. Petitioners claimed 
that about 3¼  years before the filing of the suit Ghulam Nabi 
had a stroke of paralysis, who became bedridden and was 
unable to walk or to identify any person and was also unable 
to distinguish between good or bad and that respondent No.1 
was living with him as his wife during the period of such 
illness who in connivance  with the revenue staff got the suit 
land transferred in her own favour through mutation Nos. 133 
and 206 dated 27.5.2005 by fraud  and that Ghualm Nabi was 
on deathbed suffering from marz-ul-maut who had lost his 
senses and died on 02.7.2006. With these allegations the 
petitioners sought annulment of the mutations and claimed 
3/4th share in the property. Based on the plea and assertions 
made in the plaint the Trial Court framed five issues out of 
which issues Nos.1 to 3 are relevant. These are reproduced 
below for facility of reference: 
“ISSUES:- 
1. 
Whether the original owner of suit property 
Ghulam Nabi died during Marz-Ul-Mout? OPP 
2. 
Whether the defendant No.1 in collusion with 
the revenue authority fraudulently transferred 
the disputed property in her name through 
mutation Nos.133, 206 dated 27.5.2005 and 
same mutations are ineffective upon the rights 
of plaintiff? OPP 
3. 
Whether the plaintiffs have no cause of action 
to institute the present suit? OPD”

5. 
After considering the evidence the findings recorded by 
the learned Civil Judge were that the petitioners/plaintiffs 
could not prove their case. In substance the basis of the 
findings of the learned Civil Judge were that the petitioners 
did not produce any medical evidence to prove that the 
deceased was suffering from the ailment alleged or he could 
not walk or speak or was mentally incapable of taking 
decisions. The learned Civil Judge took note of the fact that 
P.W.1 (plaintiff No.2) in her cross-examination stated that 
her uncle was not given any medical treatment nor did he 
ever ask for medical treatment while P.W.2 (plaintiff No.1)  
claimed such treatment of the deceased through one  
Dr. Parvaiz but he was never produced in the witness-box. 
As regards the testimony of P.W.3 Muhammad Ashraf, his 
testimony was disbelieved as he admitted that he never 
accompanied late Ghulam Nabi for medical treatment and 
that he did not know the name of the doctor who ever 
declared Ghulam Nabi as mentally incapacitated. As to the 
statement of P.W.5 who identified the mutations under 
challenge and also appeared for the petitioners, it was 
observed that he admitted that he identified Ghulam Nabi 
when he was asked by the patwari as to whether he knew 
Ghulam Nabi or not and that he also put his signatures on the 
mutations.  
6. 
The crux of findings was that the petitioners having 
taken specific stance about the alleged illness of the deceased 

C.R. No.661 of 2012  
 
 
 
 
Page-5 
 
 
 
Ghulam Nabi which according to them continued for 3¼ 
years, they were under heavy onus to prove the plea and they 
also were under heavy onus to establish fraud but had failed 
to do so. The non-production of medical evidence was also 
sufficient to disbelieve their version. The learned Addl. 
District Judge in appeal reexamined the entire evidence and 
observed that the petitioners failed to produce any medical 
certificate or medical evidence or so much as a prescription 
of competent medical practitioner. There was no evidence on 
record to prove that the deceased Ghulam Nabi had ever 
received medical treatment before his death. Dr. Parvaiz was 
claimed to be medical attendant of Ghulam Nabi was never 
produced nor any application was made for summoning the 
said doctor in evidence and, therefore, the petitioners had 
failed to discharge the onus to prove their case. As against 
the evidence of petitioners, respondent No. 1 appeared in the 
witness-box as D.W.1 who deposed that the oral gift was 
made 14 months prior to the death of Ghulam Nabi and that 
the witness Asghar Ali Bhatti, Naib Nazim Union Council, 
had accompanied D.W.1 to the patwarkhana of the mauza. 
He was also pattidar of the same village/mauza and 
identified the deceased. He appeared as witness for the 
petitioners/plaintiffs as P.W.5 and attempted to extend 
corroborative support to the petitioners but he could not deny 
that he had identified Ghulam Nabi before the patwari and 
tehsildar and that he had signed the register of mutation and 

C.R. No.661 of 2012  
 
 
 
 
Page-6 
 
 
 
that he always used to sign after reading the contents of 
writing and all these facts proved that Ghulam Nabi did 
appear before the patwari and tehsildar of the mauza for 
attestation of mutations and that there was no evidence of 
fraud and collusion. With these amongst other reasons the 
learned Addl. District Judge dismissed the appeal.  
7. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners could not point out 
any misreading or non-reading of evidence by the courts 
below whereby the suit of the petitioners was concurrently 
dismissed. On review of the entire evidence it is discernable 
that the petitioners’ stance for seeking indulgence against the 
mutations was based on the plea that due to attack of 
paralysis the deceased Ghulam Nabi suffered from serious 
ailment including mental unsoundness, inability to recognize 
anyone, inability to walk or speak or talk, inability to identify 
anyone, inability to decide between right or wrong and 
inability to perform his day-to-day affairs. And that he was in 
the state of marz-ul-maut during which period the mutations 
were got attested. In the first instance the petitioners did not 
allege in the plaint that the deceased ever remained under 
medical treatment of a doctor or that they had ever provided 
medical treatment to him for such alleged illness. By 
attributing unsoundness of mind, the petitioners in fact were 
alleging insanity. Question in this case was as to whether the 
petitioners had been able to establish the plea of mental 
unsoundness or disability as claimed. In Muhammad Munir 

C.R. No.661 of 2012  
 
 
 
 
Page-7 
 
 
 
and others v. Umer Hayat and others (2023 SCMR 1339) it 
was observed to the effect that the evidence of layman, 
especially relatives like son, daughter, wife, etc. may be 
relevant but being biased and exaggerated it cannot be 
conclusive. In law where the treatment is claimed to be by a 
qualified medical practitioner the appearance of such expert 
in the witness-box is necessary and non-production of such 
person without any plausible explanation would amount to a 
serious evidentiary flaw. In the instant case the plaint was 
silent as to the medical treatment of the deceased by any 
particular doctor or specialist for the illness claimed. P.W.1 
who was one of the plaintiffs in the case stated that their 
paternal uncle late Ghulam Nabi was not given any medical 
treatment by them nor did he ask for it. P.W.2 claimed 
medical treatment by one Dr. Parvaiz as well as by many 
other doctors from time to time but none of them was 
produced in evidence. In view of the assertions as to the 
nature of the disease, the deceased was allegedly suffering 
from it was incumbent on the petitioners to have produced 
some medical evidence of a specialist or the person who was 
allegedly 
treating 
the 
deceased 
in 
his 
lifetime. 
Notwithstanding the same, no effort was made nor any 
application was filed for production of Dr. Parvaiz or any 
other doctor under whose treatment the deceased, according 
to petitioners, had allegedly remained. The non-production of 
such evidence was a pivotal flaw in the case of the 

C.R. No.661 of 2012  
 
 
 
 
Page-8 
 
 
 
petitioners which fact was rightly taken note of by the courts 
below to disbelieve their stance. As to the claim that on 
account of paralysis the deceased Ghulam Nabi had lost his 
senses and was unable to recognize or to perform his 
quotidian functions and that he was passing through the state 
of marz-ul-maut; paralysis asserted could not automatically 
entail 
the 
inference 
of 
mental 
incapacitation 
or 
incomprehension which had to be specifically proved qua the 
disputed document in view of the rule supra. 
8. 
The plea of the petitioners of the deceased suffering 
from marz-ul-maut itself also could not be proved by any 
medical evidence or other evidence worthy of consideration. 
Reference in this respect can be made to the case of Mst. 
Chanan Bibi and 4 others v. Muhammad Shafi and 3 others 
(PLD 1977 SC 28) where it was observed that: 
“…The law applicable to the case is not in controversy. If the 
gift by Rajwali was made under, what the Privy Council 
described in Arabi Ghulam Arif v. Saiboo 34 I A 167 as 
"pressure of the sense of the imminence of death" then the 
gift would be hit by doctrine of marz-ul-maut. The same 
criterion was accepted by this Court in the case of 
Shamshad Ali Shah noticed earlier. Both these precedent 
cases set out the following factors which the Court should 
consider to sustain the conclusion that the impugned 
transaction was made under such pressure: 
  
"(i) Was the donor suffering at the time of the gift from a 
disease which was the immediate cause of his death? 
  
(ii) Was the disease of such a nature or character as to 
induce in the person suffering the belief that death would be 
caused thereby, or; to engender in him the apprehension of 
death? 
 
(iii) Was The illness such as to incapacitate him from the 
pursuit of his ordinary avocations-a circumstance which 
might create in the mind of the sufferer an apprehension of 
death? 
  
(iv) Had the illness continued for such a length of time as to 
remove or lessen the apprehension of immediate fatality or 
to accustom the sufferer to the malady?" 

C.R. No.661 of 2012  
 
 
 
 
Page-9 
 
 
 
  
The first is essentially a question of fact and the best 
evidence could be that of a medical attendant who treated 
the deceased at the relevant time. It is noteworthy that in 
various cases cited at the Bar some doctor or Hakim had 
appeared to testify to the condition of the patient at or about 
the time the impugned instrument was executed. Evidence 
of laymen particularly of relatives may be relevant. But it 
cannot be conclusive particularly when it is partisan and 
exaggerated. In the instant case, it was admitted by Ghulam 
Fatima plaintiff that though Rajwali remained under the 
treatment of a Hakim at Bhera but he was not examined. I 
consider this as a serious drawback in the plaintiff's case. 
The burden of proof of issue relating, marz-ul-maut lay 
heavily on the plaintiff, and the oral evidence did not inspire 
the confidence of the trial Judge...  
…Thus it is wrong to suggest that stroke of paralysis is 
immediately dangerous to life and that merely because 
Rajwali was suffering from paralysis it must be inferred that 
he was under pressure of the sense of the imminence of 
death.” 
Reference may also be made to Safi Ullah v. Ghulam Jabbar 
and four others (PLD 1955 Lah. 191) wherein the gift was 
challenged on the ground that the deceased suffered from 
prolonged illness and was bedridden before his death and 
that he executed the gift on 24.3.1948 and died on 28.8.1948; 
it was observed to the effect that mere long drawn illnesses 
like paralysis or gout per se were insufficient to sustain plea 
of marz-ul-maut. 
9. 
Curiously, the petitioners claimed that late Ghulam 
Nabi had been suffering from paralysis for more than three 
years and that during this period as per P.W.1 he was not 
provided any medical treatment but as per P.W.2 he had been 
treated by one Dr. Parvaiz who was not produced as a 
witness nor did the petitioners produce any medical evidence 
like medical certificate or doctor’s prescriptions to prove that 
the man was suffering from unsoundness of mind. Crucial 

C.R. No.661 of 2012  
 
 
 
 
Page-10 
 
 
 
point for determination in the instant case was the plea of 
insanity or unsoundness of mind at the time of attestation of 
mutations and best evidence to prove it could be of medical 
attendant/expert who treated the petitioners’ predecessor at 
the relevant time but he was not examined nor any plausible 
explanation was furnished as to why he was not produced in 
evidence. Burden of proving the alleged unsoundness of 
mind was in the first instance on the petitioners who had 
failed to discharge it by producing any credible evidence.         
10. As against this respondent No.1 appeared as D.W.1 and 
deposed on oath that the suit land was transferred in her 
favour through impugned mutations, she was in possession 
thereof and that the transaction was made 14 months before 
the death of Ghulam Nabi and that he was not suffering from 
any ailment which could affect his mental state or rendered 
him incapacitated from dealing with his day-to-day affairs 
and that the deceased was living with her till his death. She 
was supported by D.W.2 and D.W.3 who used to visit late 
Ghulam Nabi and deposed that the deceased had 
acknowledged before them about the attestation of mutation 
and of gifting the property and that he was physically and 
mentally capable to deal with his day-to-day affairs and that 
the respondent No.1 was in possession of the property. The 
significant factor is that the respondent No.1 was married to 
the deceased, the couple remained issueless but lived happily 
together. P.W.2 herself admitted that the deceased and 

C.R. No.661 of 2012  
 
 
 
 
Page-11 
 
 
 
respondent No.1 had good relations and both were living 
together. Knowing well that he was issueless and that his 
wife served him throughout by giving good and dutiful 
company, being issueless, it would be not unusual that 
difficulty which the widow could potentially suffer or 
undergo if she was not protected with sufficient resources in 
case of his demise and, being so, the motive appeared to be 
justified and obvious. It is not a case of gifting of the entire 
property to a daughter by ignoring the sons or to a son by 
ignoring the daughters. Rather it was the case where the 
couple who was issueless and the property was being 
transferred by the husband to the wife in lifetime to provide 
protective coverage.  
11. Another factor pertinent in the case was that petitioner 
Nos.1 and 2 claimed to be paternal nieces of deceased while 
respondent Nos.2 to 6 claimed to be maternal nieces who 
were not joined as plaintiffs, despite having same 
claim/interest in the inheritance of deceased who neither 
filed any suit nor supported the petitioners in the present case 
and rather opted to stay away from the proceedings. 
Petitioners could not give any plausible justification for their 
not joining in the case with them and only claimed that for 
some unavoidable reason they could not be joined. Obvious 
inference shall be that they did not support the petitioners as 
they knew that their maternal uncle had validly transferred 
the property to his issueless wife. The mutations were 

C.R. No.661 of 2012  
 
 
 
 
Page-12 
 
 
 
attested on 27.5.2005, Ghulam Nabi remained alive for 14 
months after attestation but he never challenged the 
mutations and, therefore, the petitioners could not challenge 
the validity of the gift made by the deceased who had 
acquiesced to the transaction by his conduct and action. As 
such the petitioners have no locus standi or cause of action to 
file the suit.  
12. For the reasons supra, the findings of the courts below 
do not suffer from any error of law or misreading of the 
record. No ground is made out for interference. In result, 
instant revision petition is without substance which is 
accordingly dismissed.
