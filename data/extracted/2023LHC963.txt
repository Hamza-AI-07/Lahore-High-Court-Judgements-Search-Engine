offence under Section 336 PPC at Police Station Urban 
Area District Sargodha.

 Arguments heard. Record perused. 
3. 
The FIR in hand was got registered by the 
complainant with the delay of one month and thirteen 
days regarding which no plausible explanation has been 
given therein. Per contents of crime report, when the 
petitioner was working on his grinder machine, a metal 
splinter hit into complainant’s right eye that according to 
medical evidence available on file has caused “Itlaf-e-
salahiyyat-i-udw”. Duration of injury given in the 
medico legal examination certificate by the Medical 
Officer on 19.11.2022 is about two months. Meaning 
thereby, as per findings of the Medical Officer 
occurrence probably took place during the mid of 
September, 2022 while per crime report, it happened on 
13.10.2022. Moreover, it prima facie, seems an 
occurrence accidental in nature and if it is so, Section 
336 PPC would not be applicable.

Crl. Misc. No.11382-B of 2023 
          For convenience, Section 336 PPC is reproduced 
as under: - 
“336. Punishment for Itlaf-i-salahiyyat-i-udw. 
Whoever, by doing any act with the intention of 
causing hurt to any person, or with the knowledge 
that he is likely to cause hurt to any person, causes 
itlaf-i-salahiyyat-i-udw of any person, shall, in 
consultation with the authorized medical officer, be 
punished with qisas and if the qisas is not 
executable, keeping in view the principles of 
equality in accordance with the injunction of Islam, 
the offender shall be liable to arsh and may also be 
punished with imprisonment of either description for 
a term which may extend to ten years as ta’zir.” 
A bare perusal of the provision manifests that intention 
to cause hurt or knowledge that he is likely to cause hurt, 
is a necessary requirement to constitute offence 
punishable under Section 336 PPC which prima facie, is 
missing in this case. In consideration of the facts 
mentioned above, I am of the opinion that the culpability 
of the petitioner for an offence punishable under Section 
336 PPC yet requires determination by the learned trial 
court which makes this case one of further inquiry into 
petitioner’s guilt. The petitioner is behind the bars since 
his arrest on 29.12.2022 though he is no more required 
for further investigation purposes. Hence, this petition is 
allowed and the petitioner is admitted to post arrest bail 
subject to his furnishing bail bonds in the sum of 
Rs.100,000/- with one surety in the like amount to the 
satisfaction of the learned trial court.
