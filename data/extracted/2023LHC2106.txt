Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – This petition under Article 199 of 
the 
Constitution 
of 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Pakistan, 
1973  
(the “Constitution”), is directed against the order dated 5.3.2021 passed 
by the Ex-officio Justice of Peace, Depalpur (the “Impugned Order”). 
The facts 
2. 
 
Faisal Hussain/SI lodged FIR No. 42/2021 dated 22.1.2021 
at Police Station Baseerpur, Tehsil Depalpur, District Okara, for offences 
under section 9(c) of the Control of Narcotics Substances Act, 1997 
(CNSA), and sections 324, 353, 186, 337-H(2), 148 & 149 PPC. He stated 
that on 22.1.2021 at 10:30 a.m., he was patrolling with other police 
officials when he received source information that the Petitioner’s son, 
Muhammad Sohail alias Sahaila, was seen selling narcotics near his 
house. The police party hastened to that place, apprehended him, and 
recovered 4180 grams of charas, scale, and Wattak amount of Rs.5700/-

from his possession. Meanwhile, Sohail’s brother Irfan alias Fana, Naeem 
alias Khan Baba (also known as Khalid Iqbal alias Chuchi), Atif son of 
Goggi, and 8/9 other unknown persons equipped with lethal weapons 
arrived. They opened fire on the cops intending to murder them and 
attempted to liberate Sohail and snatch the contraband charas. Hussain/SI 
further stated that Irfan and his cohorts had also committed an offence by 
obstructing the police from performing their duties and using criminal 
force against them. 
3. 
 
The Petitioner has a cross-version. She alleges that on 
22.1.2021 at 10:30 a.m., she was at home with Sohail alias Sohaila and 
another son, Irfan alias Fana. Respondents No. 2 and 5 to 16  
(police officers and Razakars) forcibly entered her house and ransacked it. 
When Sohail and Irfan tried to stop them, they beat them. She further 
alleges that Respondents No. 5 to 16 stole cash amounting to Rs.30,000/- 
and gold jewellery from her house and, in the end, took Sohail and Irfan 
with them. Irfan managed to escape the grasp of the cops and boarded his 
motorcycle parked in the street to flee. Respondent No.2 (Akhtar Khan, 
the then SHO) shot at him, striking his right thigh. Respondent No.2 to 16 
then left, taking Irfan’s unregistered Honda CD-70 motorcycle. The 
Petitioner’s family called 1122 for medical aid and rushed Irfan to the 
RHC Hospital Baseerpur. 
4. 
 
On 8.2.2021, the Petitioner moved an application under 
section 22-A(6) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (hereinafter 
referred to as the “Code” or “Cr.P.C.”) before the Ex-officio Justice of 
Peace, Depalpur. She stated that in 2015 the officials of Baseerpur and 
other police stations illegally arrested her four sons, namely, Pervaiz 
Ahmad, Amir, Muhammad Bilal, and Muhammad Sohail alias Sohaila. 
She filed a habeas petition in the High Court for their recovery but, in the 
meantime, the police killed Pervaiz Ahmad and Amir in a fake encounter. 
However, her other two sons were recovered. The Petitioner further stated 
that her daughter Aneesa Fatima had filed a private complaint against  
16 police personnel under sections 302, 364, 395, 109, 148, and 149 PPC 
regarding the aforementioned killing. The Additional Sessions Judge 
summoned the accused for trial vide order dated 16.1.2020. They 

Writ Petition No. 18561/2021 
 
 
 
- 3 - 
challenged that order in the High Court through Crl. Revision 
No.13328/2020, which was dismissed. Thereupon, the police began 
registering false cases against the Petitioner and other family members 
with mala fide intent to pressurize them to withdraw the aforesaid private 
complaint. 
5. 
 
The Petitioner contended that Respondents No.2 and 5 to 16 
had committed a cognizable offence and prayed that a direction be issued 
to the Respondent SHO to register FIR against them. The Ex-officio 
Justice of Peace, vide Impugned Order dated 5.3.2021, disposed of the 
Petitioner’s application with a direction to the District Police Officer, 
Okara, to inquire into the matter himself or through a senior police officer 
not lower than the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police and proceed 
under the law. 
6. 
 
In a subsequent development, the Additional Sessions Judge, 
Depalpur, tried Muhammad Sohail for an offence under section 9(c) of the 
CNSA in case FIR No. 42/2021 and acquitted him vide judgment dated 
24.6.2021. 
Inquiry report of the DSP/SDPO, Depalpur 
7. 
 
The DPO Okara marked the inquiry to the DSP/SDPO, 
Depalpur. He found that FIR No. 42/2021 was correct, and the 
Petitioner’s version regarding the incident of 22nd January 2021 was 
false. He confirmed that Faisal Hussain/SI genuinely arrested her son 
Muhammad Sohail for keeping 4180 grams of charas. He also found that 
the Petitioner’s other son Irfan alias Fana, and his associates made a 
straight firing on the police party and tried to have Sohail released from 
their custody but failed. In the end, they fled by running through the 
narrow streets. 
8. 
 
According to the DSP/SDPO, the Petitioner’s family 
members are habitual offenders. They are engaged in the illicit drug trade 
and involved in several criminal cases, including murders and dacoities. 
On 29.12.2015, two of the Petitioner’s sons, Pervaiz and Amir, were 
killed in a police encounter. They were proclaimed offenders in case FIR 
No. 37/2015 dated 20.1.2015 registered under sections 302, 364, 148, 149

Baseerpur. 
The submissions 
9. 
 
Mr Zafar Iqbal Chohan, Advocate, contends that the 
Petitioner’s application under section 22-A(6) Cr.P.C. discloses the 
commission of a cognizable offence. Therefore, her cross-version should 
be recorded in case FIR No. 42/2021 following the law laid down by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in Sughran Bibi v. The State  
(PLD 2018 SC 595). He submits that the Petitioner applied to the  
Ex-officio Justice of Peace for registration of her cross-version on 
8.2.2021, i.e. eighteen days after the filing of FIR No. 42/2021. Therefore, 
there was no delay on her part. She cannot be non-suited merely because 
the challan under section 9(c) of the CNSA was fast-tracked, and 
Muhammad Sohail’s trial for that offence has concluded. Mr Chohan 
further contends that denying the Petitioner relief would violate her rights 
under Articles 4 and 10-A of the Constitution. Article 4 categorically 
states that every citizen, and every other person for the time being in 
Pakistan, has an inalienable right to enjoy the protection of the law and to 
be treated according to the law. Article 10-A guarantees everyone the 
right to a fair trial, whether the accused or the complainant party.  
Mr Chohan acknowledges that a private complaint is an adequate and 
effective alternative for a cross-version but states that it cannot be refused 
if a person has a case. 
10. 
 
Mr Mukhtar Ahmad Ranjha, Additional Advocate General, 
contends that the Petitioner’s family members are hardened criminals. 
They are involved in the illicit drug trade and commit dacoities. The 
Petitioner’s cross-version is false and concocted. The report of the 
DSP/SDPO also establishes this fact. Mr Ranjha further contends that 
Sughran Bibi has settled that second FIR cannot be registered for the same 
occurrence. It only allows for the recording of cross-version, which 
cannot even be done at this stage because the trial of FIR No.42/2021 has 
concluded. The said FIR does not exist. The only remedy available to the 
Petitioner is that of a private complaint.

Advocate Rai Bashir Ahmad, the counsel for Respondents 
No. 2 and 4 to 6, has adopted the arguments of the Additional Advocate 
General with a little addition. He submits that medical evidence does not 
support the Petitioner’s version, proving it false and concocted. Hence, 
this petition may be dismissed. 
12. 
 
This Court appointed Barrister Haider Rasul Mirza as amicus 
curiae. He submits that Muhammad Sohail’s defence in FIR No. 42/2021 
was the same as his mother’s narration in her application under section 
22-A(6) Cr.P.C. He told the same story while recording his statement 
under section 342 Cr.P.C. during the trial of that case. The other accused 
persons in the FIR (his brothers and other sons of the Petitioner), namely, 
Muhammad Naeem Qamar, Irfan alias Fana, and Atif Javed, took the 
same stance in their pre-arrest bail application bearing Crl. Misc. No. 
5256/B/2021, which this Court granted on 23.2.2021. In the 
circumstances, it is reasonable to believe that on 22.1.2021, when 
Muhammad Sohail was arrested, his version was also the same. Even 
though the Investigating Officer did not write it, the State committed itself 
to the version set out in the FIR. It believed it to be true and sought his 
prosecution. Mr Mirza argues that the Petitioner’s claim that her version 
was never considered or evaluated is incorrect. Directing the State to 
register a new FIR – or a cross-version – of the same occurrence, 
reinvestigate it and conduct a new prosecution in absolute contradiction of 
the earlier process would be nonsensical and imbecile. The learned 
amicus curiae further argues that the Petitioner can prosecute 
Respondents No. 2 & 4 to 6 on her cross-version through a private 
complaint, which is an adequate and efficacious remedy. 
Opinion 
13. 
 
The Petitioner’s plea in her application under section 22-A(6) 
Cr.P.C. and FIR No. 42/2021 lodged by Faisal Hussain/SI share many 
similarities. Both parties agree that the occurrence took place on 
21.1.2021 at 10:30 a.m. The location of the incident and the police 
officials involved are all the same. Both the accounts of the occurrence 
mention the Petitioner’s sons with the common feature that one of them, 
Muhammad Sohail, was arrested – which she claims constituted an 

Writ Petition No. 18561/2021

abduction. The shooting incident is also mentioned in both narrations, 
albeit differently. The Petitioner accuses the police of inflicting firearm 
injuries while they allege that Irfan fired upon the raiding party. 
Therefore, the incident described in the Petitioner’s application under 
section 22-A(6) Cr.P.C. is unmistakably a cross-version of FIR No. 
42/2021. It is not information about a separate incident. 
14. 
 
It is necessary to examine the following two legal questions 
before attending to the factual aspects of the case: 
(i) 
Can second FIR be registered on a new/different 
version of the same incident involving the commission 
of a cognizable offence? 
 
(ii) 
Can a cross-version be recorded in a case after the 
conclusion of the trial? 
 
The first question 
15. 
 
The courts in India distinguish between lodging two FIRs 
regarding the same incident and a counter FIR. In Kari Choudhary v. Sita 
Devi and others [(2002) 1 SCC 714], the Indian Supreme Court held that 
there could not be two FIRs against the same accused regarding the same 
episode. However, competing versions normally take the form of two 
different FIRs, and the same agency can investigate both. In Upkar Singh 
v. Ved Prakash and others [(2004) 13 SCC 292], the Supreme Court 
stated that filing a “counter-complaint” about the same incident is 
permissible, and there would be serious implications if it were disallowed. 
Santosh Hegde J. wrote: 
“This will be clear from the hypothetical example given herein below, 
i.e., if in regard to a crime committed by the real accused, he takes the 
first opportunity to lodge a false complaint, and the same is registered 
by the jurisdictional police, then the aggrieved victim of such crime 
will be precluded from lodging a complaint giving his version of the 
incident in question. Consequently, he will be deprived of his 
legitimate right to bring the real accused to the book. This cannot be the 
purport of the Code.” 
 
16. 
 
In Babubahi v. State of Gujarat and others [(2010) 12 SCC 
254], the Supreme Court held that an FIR under section 154 of the Indian 
Code of Criminal Procedure1 is a very important document because it sets 
                                          
1 Section 154 of India’s Criminal Procedure Code of 1973 is similar to section 154 of Pakistan’s Code 
of Criminal Procedure, 1898.

the machinery of criminal law in motion and marks the beginning of the 
investigation. It is quite possible that the officer in charge of a police 
station may receive multiple pieces of information about an incident 
involving one or more cognizable offences. He does not have to file a new 
FIR for each such information. After the investigation into the facts stated 
in the FIR begins, all other information, whether oral or written, given to 
the officer in charge of a police station will be treated as statements under 
section 162 of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure.2 The Supreme 
Court further said that when determining whether two FIRs pertain to the 
same incident or two or more parts of the same transaction, the judge 
should consider the facts and circumstances that gave rise to both FIRs 
and apply the test of sameness. The second FIR is liable to be quashed if 
the answer is affirmative. On the other hand, if it is established that the 
version in the second FIR is different or they relate to two separate 
incidents/crimes, the second FIR is permissible. If the accused in the first 
FIR presents a different version or counter-claim regarding the same 
occurrence, both FIRs must be investigated.  In Surender Kaushik and 
others v. State of Uttar Pradesh and others [(2013) 5 SCC 148], the 
Supreme Court concluded as follows after thoroughly examining the case 
law: 
“From the aforesaid decisions, it is quite luminous that the lodgment of 
two FIRs is not permissible in respect of one and the same incident. 
The concept of sameness has been given a restricted meaning. It does 
not encompass filing of a counter-FIR relating to the same or connected 
cognizable offence. What is prohibited is any further complaint by the 
same complainant and others against the same accused subsequent to 
the registration of the case under the Code, for an investigation in that 
regard would have already commenced, and allowing registration of 
further complaint would amount to an improvement of the facts 
mentioned in the original complaint. As is further made clear by the 
three-Judge Bench in Upkar Singh,3 the prohibition does not cover the 
allegations made by the accused in the first FIR alleging a different 
version of the same incident. Thus, rival versions in respect of the same 
incident do take different shapes, and in that event, lodgment of two 
FIRs is permissible.” 
17. 
 
In P. Sreekumar v. State of Kerala and others [(2018) 4 
SCC 579], the Supreme Court ruled that there is no legal bar on filing a 
                                          
2 Section 162 of India’s Criminal Procedure Code of 1973 is similar to section 162 of Pakistan’s Code 
of Criminal Procedure, 1898.

second FIR where it is in the nature of a counter-complaint. Such FIR can 
be entertained and tried on merits according to the law.  
18. 
 
In Pakistan, there was a lack of judicial consensus on 
registering a second FIR. Finally, in Sughran Bibi v. The State  
(PLD 2018 SC 595), a 7-member Bench of the Supreme Court rendered 
an authoritative decision which also addressed the ancillary question of 
how the police should record and investigate new/different versions of the 
same incident if a second FIR cannot be registered. The apex Court held 
that the FIR is essentially an “incident report” because it informs the 
police for the first time that an occurrence involving the commission of a 
cognizable offence has taken place. Once the FIR is registered, the 
occurrence is regarded as a “case”, and every step in the ensuing 
investigation under sections 156, 157, and 159 Cr.P.C. is a step taken in 
that case. The Investigating Officer should not be swayed by the contents 
of the FIR, and he is under no obligation to establish that version. He 
must instead find out the truth. He should gather information from those 
who appear to be familiar with the details of the incident. A fresh FIR is 
not required for each new piece of information he obtains during the 
process or the discovery of a new circumstance relevant to the 
commission of the offence. Such further information or knowledge is part 
of the ongoing investigation into the same case, which began with the 
registration of the FIR. After completing the investigation, the 
Investigating Officer should file a report under section 173 Cr.P.C. on the 
real facts that he discovers, regardless of the version of the incident 
advanced by the first informant or any other version brought to his notice 
by any other person. 
19. 
 
In Sughran Bibi, the  Supreme Court iterated that the power 
to investigate is related to the offence and is not limited to the facts 
mentioned in the FIR. If the information received by the police about the 
commission of a cognizable offence also includes details of how and by 
whom it was committed, or anything regarding its background, that is 
only the informant’s version of the incident. The Investigating Officer 
should not accept it unqualifiedly as the whole truth. Moreover, all 
versions of the incident are recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C., whether 

Writ Petition No. 18561/2021 
 
 
 
- 9 - 
supplemental or divergent, and all of them are part of the same “case” that 
originated with the registration of the FIR as aforesaid.  
20. 
 
It is pertinent to mention that the accused’s version of the 
events also comes under section 161 Cr.P.C. In Raza v. The State  
(PLD 2020 SC 523), the apex Court held: 
“18. 
The expression ‘any person’ has to be understood in the context 
of section 161 Cr.P.C. It requires a police officer making an 
investigation to examine any person supposed to be acquainted with the 
facts and circumstances of the case. This expression is extensive and, in 
its plain and ordinary meaning, includes all persons who are supposed 
to be acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case and not 
only the witnesses but also those who are alleged to have committed 
the offence under investigation in a case …” 
“19. 
It is common that in most cases, a version of the same 
occurrence different from the one recorded in FIR is given by the 
accused, as it happened in the present case. And, in view of the law 
declared in Sughran Bibi, it can be said with certainty that such version 
of an accused is to be, and is, recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C.” 
21. 
 
The restriction under section 154 Cr.P.C. that FIRs can be 
registered only regarding cognizable offences does not apply to cross-
versions. It is for the obvious reason that they are recorded under section 
161 Cr.P.C., as mandated by Sughran Bibi. However, registration of a 
cross-version does not obligate the Investigating Officer to arrest the 
accused immediately. There must be sufficient justification for it. The 
following excerpt from Sughran Bibi is relevant: 
“Ordinarily, no person is to be arrested straightaway only because he 
has been nominated as an accused person in an FIR or in any other 
version of the incident brought to the notice of the investigating officer 
by any person until the investigating officer feels satisfied that 
sufficient justification exists for his arrest and such justification he is to 
be guided by the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure, 1898, and the Police Rules, 1934. According to the relevant 
provisions of the said Code and the Rules, a suspect is not to be 
arrested straight away or as a matter of course, and unless the situation 
on the ground so warrants, the arrest is to be deferred till such time that 
sufficient material or evidence becomes available on the record of 
investigation prima facie satisfying the investigating officer regarding 
the correctness of the allegations levelled against such suspect or 
regarding his involvement in the crime in issue.” 
 
22. 
 
The Code is silent on the procedure for the trial of counter-
cases. Nonetheless, the general practice is that they are tried concurrently 
by the same court, which renders judgment in each case simultaneously. 
The logic behind this practice is that there is a high risk of conflicting 
decisions if two cases involving different versions of the same incident 

Writ Petition No. 18561/2021 
 
 
 
- 10 -
are not tried together. In Nathi Lal and others v. State of U.P. [1990 SCC 
(Cri) 638], the Supreme Court of India ruled as follows on the issue of the 
trial of cross cases: 
“We think that the fair procedure to adopt in a matter like the present 
where there are cross cases, is to direct that the same learned Judge 
must try both the cross cases one after the other. After the recording of 
evidence in one case is completed, he must hear the arguments but he 
must reserve the judgment. Thereafter he must proceed to hear the 
cross case and after recording all the evidence he must hear the 
arguments but reserve the judgment in that case. The same learned 
Judge must thereafter dispose of the matters by two separate judgments. 
In deciding each case, he can rely only on the evidence recorded in that 
case. The evidence recorded in the cross case cannot be looked into. 
Nor can the judge be influenced by whatever is argued in the cross-
case. Each case must be decided on the basis of the evidence which has 
been placed on record in that particular case without being influenced 
in any manner by the evidence or arguments urged in the cross case. 
But both the judgments must be pronounced by the same learned Judge 
one after the other.” 
23. 
 
In State of Karnataka v. Hosakeri Ningappa and another 
(2012 ILR Karnataka 509), two counter-cases arising from the same 
incident were tried separately by the same Sessions Judge, and both ended 
in acquittal. The judgment of acquittal in one of them attained finality 
while the State preferred an appeal in the second before the High Court. 
The question arose as to whether the entire trial gets vitiated or whether it 
is only an irregularity which does not vitiate the trial process or the order 
of acquittal. A Full Bench of the Karnataka High Court held that if the 
counter-cases are not tried simultaneously, the proceedings do not get ipso 
facto vitiated. But, where the irregular procedure adopted by the trial 
court has caused prejudice to the accused and has occasioned a failure of 
justice, the proceedings and the trial vitiates. Otherwise, the defect is 
curable. The Andhra High Court followed this dictum in The State of 
A.P. v. Mittapalli Sudhakar Reddy and others.4 
24. 
 
In Muhammad Sadiq v. The State and another (PLD 1971 
SC 713), the trial of a challan case under sections 148, 302, 307, 149, PPC 
had concluded, and the Sessions Judge had set a date for delivering his 
judgment. A Magistrate of the First Class was holding the trial of a 
counter-complaint case filed by one of the accused in the challan case and 
stemming from the same occurrence. In this backdrop, the accused in the

challan case applied under section 561-A Cr.P.C. for restraining the Court 
of Sessions from announcing judgment in the challan case until the 
hearing of the complaint case was complete. The High Court acceded to 
this prayer and stayed the announcement of the judgment by the Sessions 
Judge. The Supreme Court of Pakistan held that the Code is silent about 
the procedure for the trial of counter-cases arising out of the same 
occurrence. While it is the general practice to try the counter-cases side by 
side by the same court till their conclusion and to pronounce the judgment 
in each case simultaneously, it is not an absolute rule that must always be 
followed. The facts and circumstances of a particular case may warrant a 
different procedure for the ends of justice. The Supreme Court accepted 
the appeal, set aside the High Court’s order and directed the Sessions 
Judge to pronounce the judgment. In Abdul Rehman Bajwa v. Sultan and 
others (PLD 1981 SC 522), the Supreme Court reaffirmed the above 
view, distinguishing Nur Elahi v. The State and others (PLD 1966 SC 
708), and M. Rehman and others v. Narayanganj Company (Private) 
Ltd. (PLD 1971 SC 1).5 
25. 
 
I would conclude the discussion on the first issue by stating 
that after the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s ruling in Sughran Bibi, there is no 
scope for recording a second FIR for the same incident, even for a cross-
version. 
The second question 
26. 
 
Registration of a cross-version necessitates reinvestigation or 
further investigation. Whether a case can be reinvestigated or further 
investigated after the submission of the final report under section 173 
Cr.P.C. (particularly after the accused is/are indicted) is quite contentious. 
There are two seemingly irreconcilable streams of decisions on this point. 
In Abid Hussain v. The State and others (2022 PCr.LJ 83) and Altaf 
Ahmed Makhdoom v. Inspector General of Police Punjab etc.  
(2023 PCr.LJ 1), this Court thoroughly examined the case-law and ruled 
that the Supreme Court’s dictum laid down in Muhammad Akbar v. The 
State and another (1972 SCMR 335) is the binding authority because a  
                                          
5 Also see: Abdul Shakoor v. The State and another (2012 PCr.LJ 231); Sanobar and 2 others v. The 
State and others (PLD 2018 Peshawar 144); and Muhammad Arif and others v. The State  
(2022 MLD 1589).

4-member Bench handed down that decision while all others have come  
from the  Benches of low numerical strength. In Muhammad Akbar, the 
apex Court held that “there is nothing in the Code of Criminal Procedure 
to prevent the Investigating Officer from submitting a subsequent report 
in supersession of his earlier one, either on his own initiative or on the 
direction of the superior police officer.” 
27. 
 
Although 
reinvestigation 
or 
further 
investigation 
is 
permissible, it cannot be done routinely. There are several limitations, one 
of which is that it cannot be when the trial is over. Bahadur Khan v. 
Muhammad Azam and others (2006 SCMR 373) is a case in point. 
According to the facts, Dilawar Khan was driving a Datsun pickup when 
he hit Raza and killed him. Raza’s family alleged that it was a murder 
rather than an accident. Consequently, they shot Dilawar in retaliation a 
few months later. Bahadar Khan lodged FIR in respect of that occurrence. 
The trial court convicted accused Muhammad Arif and sentenced him to 
death but acquitted co-accused Muhammad Akram and Mir Hassan of the 
charge. The High Court acquitted Arif and convicted Akram and Mir 
Hassan, and sentenced them to life. The Supreme Court set aside Mir 
Hassan’s conviction but upheld Akram’s conviction and sentence. 
Subsequently, the prosecution submitted challan under sections 212,  
120-B/34 PPC against two more persons, Muhammad Azam and 
Abdullah Khan, in the court which conducted the previous trial. The 
Additional Sessions Judge convicted Muhammad Azam under section 212 
PPC and acquitted Abdullah, his co-accused. Bahadur Khan contended 
before the Supreme Court that the facts constituting the offence under 
sections 212 and 120-B/34 PPC came to light during the investigation of 
another case having nexus with the murder case of Dilawar Khan. 
Therefore, on completion of the investigation, a challan, which was in 
continuation of the one filed earlier, was submitted to the trial court that 
decided the murder case. Bahadur argued that the subsequent challan was 
competent and the Additional Sessions Judge had rightly convicted 
Muhammad Azam. There was no prohibition on the police to 
reinvestigate or further investigate the lateral aspects of the case which 

Writ Petition No. 18561/2021

came to light subsequently. They could submit a new report under section 
173 Cr.P.C. The apex Court nixed the argument holding as follows: 
“[There is no legal bar on] reinvestigation of a criminal case even after 
submission of the final report under section 173 Cr.P.C., and the police 
can carry out the fresh investigation and submit its report to the court. 
But this would not mean that in a case in which earlier, after 
completion of the investigation, challan was submitted for the trial of 
an offence on which an accused/accused persons have been tried, and 
the case finally decided up to the level of the High Court and by this 
Court, as the case may be, to entertain the subsequent challan submitted 
as the result of reinvestigation/further investigation of the case by the 
police on the happening of a subsequent incident and to proceed with 
the trial of the case in the normal course oblivious of the facts of the 
case decided earlier by such court, and, the facts and circumstances 
including incriminating material necessitated submission of the 
subsequent challan in the case already having been decided and 
attained finality.” 
28. 
 
No law allows recording a statement under section 161 
Cr.P.C. once a case is decided. After the Supreme Court’s ruling in 
Sughran Bibi that all versions after filing the FIR are recorded under 
section 161 Cr.P.C., reinvestigation or further investigation in a concluded 
case is impossible.  
29. 
 
I would sum up the law on the issue as follows: Sughran Bibi 
merely prohibits the registration of a second FIR, not a cross-version. 
Therefore, so long as the trial has not concluded, it can be permitted, even 
at a belated stage, to prevent a miscarriage of justice. If the (original) FIR 
has been taken to its logical end, the only option for the individual who 
wishes to prosecute another on his cross-version is to file a private 
complaint. Here, I agree with Mr Mirza, the amicus curiae, that when the 
police present the report under section 173 Cr.P.C. (challan), the State 
commits itself to the version set out therein and, believing it to be true, 
seeks the accused’s trial. It would be ludicrous to direct the State to 
register a new FIR – or a cross-version – of the same occurrence, 
reinvestigate it and launch another prosecution in absolute contradiction 
of the earlier process. 
30. 
 
I may emphasize that a private complaint is an adequate and 
efficacious remedy. The following excerpt from Sughran Bibi is quite 
instructive: 

Writ Petition No. 18561/2021 
 
 
 
- 14 -
“By virtue of the provisions of section 202(1), Cr.P.C. a court seized of 
a private complaint can ‘direct an inquiry or investigation to be made 
by any Justice of Peace or by a police officer or by such other person as 
it thinks fit.’ If, in a given case, the court seized of a private complaint 
deems it appropriate to direct an investigation to be carried out in 
respect of the allegations made, then the powers available during an 
investigation, enumerated in Part V, Chapter XIV of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1898 read with section 4(1)(1) of the same Code, 
including the powers to arrest an accused person and to effect recovery 
from his possession or at his instance. Such powers of the investigating 
officer recognize no distinction between an investigation in a State case 
and an investigation in a complaint case.” 
 
31. 
 
Of course, there may be instances where the police refuse to 
take a person’s cross-version, and he seeks legal redress against them, 
such as moving the Ex-officio Justice of Peace under section 22-A(6) 
Cr.P.C. However, due to procedural delays, the trial in the FIR case 
concludes before the decision on his cross-version request. In that 
scenario, although the individual is not to blame for the delays, a 
combined application of the principles settled in Sughran Bibi and 
Bahadur Khan would preclude recording his cross-version. His only 
recourse would be a private complaint. 
The case at hand 
32. 
 
The occurrence mentioned in the Petitioner’s application 
under section 22-A(6) Cr.P.C. is manifestly a cross-version of FIR No. 
42/2021. It cannot be considered as information of a different incident 
regarding the commission of a cognizable offence that would warrant 
registering a separate FIR. 
33. 
 
FIR No. 42/2021 was registered under section 9(c) of the 
CNSA and sections 324, 353, 186, 337-H(2), 148 & 149 PPC. The 
prosecution was required to submit two challans in this case – one under 
the CNSA and the other under PPC – because they are triable by separate 
courts. The Additional Sessions Judge tried Muhammad Sohail for the 
offence under section 9(c) of the CNSA and acquitted him vide judgment 
dated 24.6.2021. If FIR No. 42/2021 had only been under this offence, 
this petition might have been dismissed right away for the reasons given 
in paragraph 31 above. This Court would have refused the Petitioner relief 
even though she promptly approached the Ex-officio Justice of Peace to 
register her cross-version (i.e. eighteen days after filing FIR No. 42/2021), 
and there was also no subsequent delay on her part. However, in the 

Writ Petition No. 18561/2021 
 
 
 
- 15 -
present case, the aforesaid FIR is partially still alive because Irfan alias 
Fana and others were charged with the Penal Code offences, but the 
challan has not been submitted before the Magistrate to their extent. In the 
circumstances, one may argue that the principle settled in Bahadur Khan 
is inapplicable. 
34. 
 
The DPO Okara marked the inquiry to the DSP/SDPO, 
Depalpur, who has not supported the Petitioner’s version. She claims that 
Irfan was shot in the upper part of the right thigh. On 10.2.2021, the 
District Standing Medical Board examined him, and its members 
unanimously opined that his injury seemed to be fabricated for the 
following reasons: 
i) 
According to the injured, he was hit by SMG from a distance of 
25-30 feet, but the effective range of SMG, according to 
Encyclopaedia Britannica, is 180 metres. So, SMG bullet fired 
from 30 feet is unlikely to stop in superficial soft tissue. 
ii) 
Bullet is lying parallel to the bone without hitting the bone or 
any hard surface. It is unlikely to be deflected. 
iii) 
Clothes are not produced before DSMB even after repeated 
reminders. 
iv) 
Placement of the bullet in the right thigh (soft tissue) does not 
correspond to have been inflicted/during a spontaneous scuffle. 
35. 
 
On 22.8.2022, the Provincial Standing Medical Board  
re-examined Irfan under court orders and reaffirmed the above findings of 
the District Board. 
36. 
 
A Single Judge of this Court held in Mureed Hussain v. 
Additional Sessions Judge/Justice of Peace Jampur and others  
(2014 P.Cr.LJ 1146) that the Ex-officio Justice of Peace was not bound to 
seek a report from the police in every case. He was competent to decide 
an application under Section 22-A(6) Cr.P.C. without it. In an earlier case, 
Khizar Hayat and others v. Inspector General of Police (Punjab) and 
others (PLD 2005 Lah. 470), a Full Bench of this Court observed that it 
was appropriate for him to call for a report to understand why the police 
refused to register a case. The Court said: 
“It is prudent and advisable for an Ex-officio Justice of Peace to call for 
comments of the officer in charge of the relevant police station in 
respect of complaints of this nature before taking any decision of his 
own in that regard so that he may be apprised of the reasons why the 
local police have not registered a criminal case in respect of the 
complainant’s allegations. It may well be that the complainant has been 

Writ Petition No. 18561/2021 
 
 
 
- 16 -
economizing with the truth, and the comments of the local police may 
help in completing the picture and making the situation clearer for the 
Ex-officio Justice of Peace, facilitating him in issuing a just and correct 
direction, if any.”  
37. 
 
The Supreme Court has authoritatively ruled in the case of 
Younas Abbas and others v. Additional Sessions Judge, Chakwal and 
others (PLD 2016 SC 581) that the Ex-officio Justice of Peace performs 
quasi-judicial functions under section 22-A(6) Cr.P.C. Therefore, before 
issuing any direction on a complaint for non-registration of a criminal 
case, he must satisfy himself that there is sufficient justification for it. He 
must address himself to the facts of the case, and where he disagrees with 
the police report, he should give reasons for his disagreement. He can’t 
just ignore it. 
38. 
 
In the instant case, neither the police report nor the medical 
evidence supports the Petitioner’s cross-version. Therefore, her request 
for its registration cannot be granted. This petition is dismissed.
