Appellants by: 
Pirzada

Qureshi, 
Advocate.  
Respondent No.1(a) by: Muhammad Khalid Mahmood Ayaz, 
Advocate.  
 
Appellant No.3 Asif Khan in person.  
 
AHMAD NADEEM ARSHAD, J.  Through this Regular 
Second Appeal appellants have assailed the vires of judgments & 
decrees of the Courts below dated 26.03.2004 and 07.06.2005 
whereby suit of respondent No.1 was decreed concurrently.  
2. 
Tersely, necessary facts forming background of proceedings in 
hand are that plaintiff/respondent No.1 Muhammad Iqbal Khan 
(hereinafter referred to as “respondent No.1”) instituted a suit for 
declaration on 09.10.1996 titled “Muhammad Iqbal Khan V. Collector, 
etc.” against the Collector and legal heirs of Muhammad Anwar 
Khan Lodhi/defendants No.2 to 11/appellants & respondent No.2 
(hereinafter referred to as “Appellants”) by contending therein that 
plot No.8(19-20) situated in Block No.E, Khasra No.9976 measuring 
06 Marlas & 16 ½ feet, Dera Ghazi Khan (hereinafter referred to as 
“suit property”) was an evacuee property which came in the custody 
of Rehabilitation Department and after the diminishing of 
Rehabilitation Department, ADC(G) is custodian of evacuee 
properties; that respondent No.1 moved an application to the 

R.S.A. No. 56 of 2005. 
2
Rehabilitation Department that the suit property be given to him for 
consideration and as such he paid an amount of Rs.4770/- and got the 
suit property; that after making due payment respondent No.1 
became exclusive owner of the suit property but appellants, by taking 
advantage of his absence, illegally occupied over the suit property in 
the month of May, 1998; that respondent No.1 had appointed 
predecessor of the appellants namely Muhammad Anwar Khan as his 
special attorney to look after the affairs of suit property; that from 
inspection of Rehabilitation record  it came to his knowledge that 
P.T.O was issued in the name of Muhammad Anwar Khan, whereas, 
it was to be issued in his name; that he felt need of inspection of the 
record as appellants were adamant to sell the plot upon which he 
came to know that predecessor of appellants have fraudulently got 
issued P.T.O in his name; that he time & again asked them to get 
their names deleted from the record of Rehabilitation Department but 
they refused to do so, which constrained him to institute the suit.  
3. 
Contrarily, appellants contested the suit by filing written 
statement in contrast whereby they raised certain legal as well as 
factual objections. They asserted that suit property has been 
transferred in the name of their predecessor namely Muhammad 
Anwar Khan through Transfer Order (PTD No.61666 dated 09.01.1974) 
from Rehabilitation Department; that the Rehabilitation Laws have 
been repealed since July 1974; that against the Transfer Orders no 
appeal, revision, review have been filed, therefore, it attained finality, 
hence, it was a past & closed transaction; that the Court has no 
jurisdiction to entertain the suit; that respondent No.1 has not 
challenged Provisional Transfer Order and Transfer Order with 
regard to the suit property, therefore, suit is not maintainable in its 
present form; that the plaint does not disclose any cause of action; 
that Provisional Transfer Order and Transfer Order with regard to 
suit property was issued in the name of Muhammad Anwar Khan in 
the years 1960 & 1974, therefore, the suit is not within time; that 
respondent No.1 has no possession over any portion of the suit 
property; that the value for the purpose of Court fee and jurisdiction 

R.S.A. No. 56 of 2005. 
3
was not correctly assessed; that respondent No.1 is real brother of 
original allottee Muhammad Anwar Khan and he admitted him 
owner in possession of the suit property in his lifetime, therefore, he 
is estopped to file the suit from his own words & conduct; that 
parties settled their disputes alongwith the dispute of suit property 
amicably wherein respondent No.1 admitted Muhammad Anwar 
Khan as owner of the suit property; that the suit is bad due to non-
joinder and mis-joinder of parties. While replying on facts, they 
admitted that suit property is an evacuee property and after 
diminishing of Rehabilitation Department it was in the custody of 
Province of Punjab. They further maintained that suit property was 
rightly transferred in the name of their predecessor and alleged that 
respondent No.1 did not give any power of attorney to their 
predecessor with regard to the suit property. Learned Trial Court 
reduced the controversy in the following issues:

Whether the plaintiff is owner in possession of disputed 
plot No.8 block-E DGKhan city? OPP

4. 
After recording evidence of the parties pro & contra, oral as 
well as documentary, learned Trial Court decreed the suit vide 
judgment & decree dated 26.03.2004 in the following manner: 
 
“…the suit of the plaintiff is decreed to the extent that record of 
Settlement Department/Revenue Department is required to be 
corrected in favour of the plaintiff and he is also entitled for its 
possession. To the extent of mesne profits his claim is rejected 
and there is no evidence in this respect from his side. The parties 
are left to bear their own cost.” 
 
5. 
Feeling aggrieved, appellants preferred an appeal which was 
dismissed by the learned appellate Court via judgment & decree 
dated 07.06.2005. Being dissatisfied, they approached this Court 
through Regular Second Appeal which also met the same fate and 
dismissed through judgment dated 26.10.2010. Appellants called into 
question the vires of the judgment of this Court by preferring Civil 
Appeal (No.88 of 2011) before august Supreme Court of Pakistan 
whereby the matter was remanded vide order dated 18.01.2016 with 
the following observation: 
“Learned ASC appearing on behalf of respondent No.1 contended that what he 
is concerned with is final adjudication of the case whether it is done by this 
Court or on remand by the High Court or even the Notified Officer but in no 
case its procrastination is in the interest of justice or the parties as it would tend 
multiply their agonies. In these circumstances, all the learned ASCs for the 
parties agree that the matter be remanded to High Court for decision afresh by 
attending to all the questions raised in this case including the application moved 
by respondent No.2 before the High Court, without creating another occasion 
for remand of the case. In this view of the matter, and with the consent of 
learned ASCs for the parties, we allow this appeal, set aside the impugned 
judgment and send the case to the High Court for decision afresh as hinted to 
above. Let this case be given priority in view of its age as it was instituted in the 
High Court in 2005. Needless to say the High Court may examine the original 
record. As the learned Judge hearing the case earlier, has expressed his view, 
let this case be listed before some other Judge of the High Court.” 
 
6. 
The Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan while remanding the 
matter to this Court directed to attend the application moved by 
respondent No.2 for setting aside of ex-parte judgment and decree. 
Perusal of record it appears that respondent No.2 did not move any 
application before this Court for setting aside of ex-parte judgment 
and decree. The learned trial court proceeded ex-parte against the 
respondent No.2 vide order dated 27.06.1997 after publication in the 
newspaper and decreed the suit after full-fledged trial vide judgment 
and decree dated 26.03.2004. Respondent No.2 (Arshad Yar Khan 

R.S.A. No. 56 of 2005. 
5
Lodhi) moved an application on 15.04.2004 for setting aside of the 
ex-parte judgment & decree dated 26.03.2004 before the learned 
Trial Court, which was resisted by respondent No.1 through filing its 
contesting written reply. Learned Trial Court, in the light of 
divergent stances of the parties, framed issues and invited the parties 
to produce their respective evidence. During the proceedings of said 
application, respondent No.2 left to attend the Court, therefore, 
learned Trial Court dismissed his application for non-prosecution 
vide order dated 04.12.2012. Respondent No.2 moved an application 
for its restoration which was allowed vide order dated 19.12.2013 
and restored his application. Subsequently said application was 
adjourned sine-die vide order dated 06.11.2014. When confronted to 
the learned counsel for respondent No.2 namely Sheikh Muhammad 
Shafi-ur-Rehman Advocate that how this Court can decide said 
application of respondent No.2 for setting aside ex-parte judgment 
and decree of learned trial court pending before the said court. He 
frankly conceded that this Court has no jurisdiction to set-aside the 
judgment and decree of learned Trial Court at this stage on the 
application of respondent No.2 which is pending before the learned 
trial court. However, he states that respondent No.2 does not press 
his application for setting aside ex-parte judgment & decree moved 
under Order IX Rule 13 C.P.C. and seeks to withdraw it if an 
opportunity of hearing is provided to him, therefore, said application 
of respondent No.2 is dismissed as withdrawn.   
7. 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties (including 
respondent No.2) at length and perused the record with their able 
assistance. In addition to this, I have also summoned the original 
record of Settlement & Rehabilitation Department and gone through 
the same carefully.  
8. 
Admittedly, suit property bearing plot No.8 (19-20) situated in 
Khasra No.9976 measuring 06 Marlas & 16 ½ feet was an evacuee 
property which was allotted by Settlement and Rehabilitation 
Department. The stance of respondent No.1 is that suit property 
allotted to him against his reservation and he paid the price of the 

R.S.A. No. 56 of 2005. 
6
suit property and appointed Muhammad Anwar Khan Lodhi as his 
special attorney to look after the affairs of the suit property but he 
fraudulently got transferred the same in his name. Whereas, version 
of the appellants is that suit property was originally allotted to their 
predecessor namely Muhammad Anwar Khan through Provisional 
Transfer Order in the year 1960 and thereafter Transfer Order was 
also issued in his name in the year 1974 and he was remained 
occupant of the suit property during his lifetime and after his demise 
appellants being his legal heirs occupied the same. Learned Trial 
Court with regard to said controversy framed issues No.1 to 3 and 
decided the same in favour of respondent No.1 and said findings 
were upheld by the learned first Appellate Court. In order to reach a 
just conclusion, it is better to evaluate the evidence produced by the 
parties both oral as well as documentary.   
9. 
From scanning of record it appears that respondent No.1 got 
recorded his statement as P.W.1 and produced Gull Muhammad 
Khan as P.W.2. In documentary evidence, he produced thirteen 
documents as Exh.P.1 to Exh.P.13. On the other hand, appellants 
produced Sajjad Hussain ASI as D.W.1, Muhammad Shahzad Khan 
as D.W.2 and one of the appellants namely Muhammad Asif Lodhi 
appeared as D.W.3. They produced fifteen documents as Exh.D.1 to 
Exh.D.15.  
10. 
Respondent No.1 while recording his statement as P.W.1 
deposed that he is owner of the suit property on the basis of 
reservation of Rehabilitation Department and he paid Rs.4770/- as its 
price. He explained that he made partial payment through claim and 
remaining amount through bank challan. He maintained that Anwar 
Khan Lodhi was his elder brother who was used to initiate any 
proceedings or moved any application to Rehabilitation Department 
on his behalf being his special attorney. Further maintained that he 
appointed him as attorney because he was not residing there. 
Respondent No.1 also produced Gull Muhammad Khan as P.W.2 
who supported his version.  

R.S.A. No. 56 of 2005.

11. 
Respondent No.1 produced copy of an application moved to 
Deputy Settlement Commissioner D.G Khan on 29.09.1964 as 
Exh.P.1. Perusal of said application it appears that it was moved on 
his behalf through his special attorney. Said application was moved 
through signature of Anwar Khan Lodhi. It was disclosed in the said 
application that property No.19-20/9976, Block No.E, D.G Khan 
was transferred to him and he showed his intention to pay the 
balance transferred price of Rs.2826/- towards the said property and 
wants to clear the total dues vide deed of association and attached 
CB No.1433.  
 
The objection of the appellants is that at the bottom of 
application words “for Muhammad Iqbal Khan through special 
attorney” were subsequently interpolated.  
 
It is a certified copy issued by relevant department and 
attached presumption of correctness being a public document. 
Appellants did not raise any said objection before proper forum, 
therefore, this objection has no force.  
12. 
Respondent No.1 produced copy of an application dated 
06.01.1966 addressed to the Deputy Settlement Commissioner as  
Exh.P.2 wherein he prayed for issuance of PTO of Plot No.19-20 
(Khasra No.9976). Said application was also shown to be moved 
through A.K. Lodhi, Special Attorney of respondent No.1.   
 
The appellants also alleged interpolation in this application by 
maintaining that words “special attorney and elder brother of the 
allottee named Muhammad Iqbal Khan Lodhi s/o Muhammad 
Ayyub Khan resident of House No.9, B.‟E‟ D.G.Khan” were 
subsequently added.  
 
It is a certified copy issued by relevant department and 
attached presumption of correctness being a public document. 
Appellants did not raise any said objection before proper forum, 
therefore, this objection has no force.  
13. 
Exh.P.3 is challan form whereby an amount of Rs.1944/- as 
outstanding consideration price of plots No.19-20 was deposited by 

R.S.A. No. 56 of 2005. 
8
respondent No.1 through Faiz Muhammad Khan. Said payment was 
made on 28.02.1974.  
 
Appellants alleged that it is a forged document. It is a certified 
copy issued by relevant department and attached presumption of 
correctness. 
The 
Settlement 
& 
Rehabilitation 
Department 
acknowledged the said deposit, hence, appellant‟s objection has no 
force.  
14. 
Exh.P.4 is also copy of challan form wherein Rs.23.85 were 
deposited on account of settlement fee of plots No.19-20 Khasra 
No.9976 from respondent No.1. Said amount was tendered by A.Q. 
Khan and deposited on 01st April 1965. It is also a certified copy of 
original record.  
15. 
Exh.P.5 is deed of agreement dated 29.09.1964 which was 
executed between Muhammad Naeem Khan and respondent No.1 
through his special attorney Anwar Khan Lodhi, wherein 
Muhammad Naeem Khan agreed that the amount of Rs.2826/- 
deposited by him will be adjusted from CB No..DGK.1433/30607 in 
the PTD case of House No.153 Block-E D.G. Khan towards the 
balance of transfer price. Through this document, Muhammad 
Naeem Khan agreed  to give authority to respondent No.1 to use his 
compensation book towards payment of the price of suit property 
transferred to him by the Deputy Settlement Commissioner. 
Appellants denied existence of said agreement. However, it is matter 
of record that payment of Rs.2826/- was made in the light of said 
agreement. Predecessor of appellants signed this document on behalf 
of respondent No.1 as his special attorney.  
16. 
Exh.P.6 is copy of application form for permanent transfer of 
evacuee property, bearing registration No.6340 dated 31.03.1965, 
wherein name of respondent No.1 is written as applicant and detail of 
evacuee property was mentioned as Khasra No.9976 Block No.E,   
19-20 D.G. Khan. At the backside of said document price was 
mentioned as Rs.4770/- and settlement fee Rs.23.85. It is a printed 
form wherein entries were hand written.  

R.S.A. No. 56 of 2005.

17. 
Exh.P.7 is an application dated 09.11.1960 moved by A.K 
Lodhi (predecessor of the appellants) on behalf of respondent No.1 
and prayed that suit property be transferred in his name.  
 
Appellants also raised objection upon the said Exh.P-7 by 
maintaining that said application was also interpolated. They alleged 
that actually first para was written as under:- 
“I most respectfully submitted that the above plot may very 
kindly be transferred and reserved in may name…..” 
 
But after cutting the word “my” word “the” was inserted and words 
“of Muhammad Iqbal Khan” were added and made this para as 
under:- 
“I most respectfully submitted that the above plot may very kindly be 
transferred in the name of Muhammad Iqbal Khan……” 
 
At the bottom “A. K. Lodhi s/o Muhammad Ayyub Khan” was 
manipulated and made it “A.K. Lodhi s/a for Muhammad Iqbal 
Khan”.  
 
 It is also a certified copy of a record maintained by public 
Department. Appellants did not move any objection before the 
concerned Department for such alleged interpolation.  
18. 
Exh.P.8/Exh.D.10 is Provisional Transfer Order No.090376 
dated 31.12.1960 wherein it was disclosed that suit property was 
transferred to A.K. Lodhi. Said letter was issued by Deputy 
Settlement Commissioner.   
19. 
Exh.P.9/Exh.D.11 
is 
Transfer 
Order 
No.61666 
dated 
09.01.1974 wherein suit property was transferred in the name of 
predecessor of the appellants namely A.K. Lodhi. In the said 
Transfer Order, transfer price Rs.4470/-, Settlement Fee Rs.22/35 
total 4492/35 was shown outstanding in the schedule „A‟ and in 
schedule-B it was stated that Rs.1944 was paid in cash, whereas, 
Rs.2826 adjusted from C.B No.DGK 1433/30607. There are also two 
cuttings in the said document. “Iqbal” was replaced by “Ayub” and 
Iqbal was replaced by “Ayub”. Spelling of Ayub and handwriting of 
both the cuttings are different. First cutting was made through black 
ink with an initial in green ink. Exh.P.9 showing Ayub with spelling 
of “Ayub”, whereas, Exh.D.11 showing spelling as “Ayyub”. 

R.S.A. No. 56 of 2005. 
10
Whereas, second cutting was cutting was made through green ink 
and Ayub was also written in green ink. Said cutting were made on 
27.11.1980 much after issuance of original Transfer Order which 
was issued on 09.01.1974. It appears that said cutting were made to 
accommodate appellants.   
20. 
Exh.P.10 is an application moved by respondent No.1 to the 
ADC(G)/DSC D.G Khan for inquiry and correction of Transfer 
Order dated 22.09.1980 regarding plot No.19-20. On the backside of 
said application, report was made on 21.10.1996 by Fayyaz Baig, 
Settlement Clerk, wherein it was disclosed that from the perusal of 
file it appears that application for transfer of the suit property was 
moved by Muhammad Iqbal Khan applicant through A.K Lodhi and 
all dues were paid by said Muhammad Iqbal and application for 
issuance of P.T.D was also moved on his behalf through his brother 
A.K Lodhi but for the unknown reasons PTO was issued in the name 
of applicant‟s brother.  
21. 
Exh.P.11 is attested copy of register wherein it was disclosed 
that amount Rs.2826 was adjusted vide CB No.1433/30607 of 
No.0714D.G K and an amount of Rs.1944/- was paid in cash vide 
challan No.51 dated 28.02.1974. A note was also given that an 
agreement regarding compensation book No.DGA-1433 was 
attached with file which was not allowed and through said agreement 
amount Rs.2826 was obtained.  
22. 
Exh.P.12 is also attested copy of register wherein at serial 
No.1384 T.O No.61666, name of A.K Lodhi s/a Muhammad Iqbal 
Khan with regard to plot No.19/20 was mentioned.  
23. 
Exh.P.13 is copy of special power of attorney dated 
24.11.1959 wherein respondent No.1 namely Muhammad Iqbal Khan 
appointed his real elder brother namely Anwar Khan Lodhi as his 
special attorney in the following manner:- 
“By this power of attorney, I, Mohd Iqbal Khan Lodhi s/o late 
Mohd Ayub Khan resident of Karachi do hereby constitute and 
appoint my elder (real) brother namely Mr. Anwar Khan Lodhi s/o 
late Mohd Ayob Khan special attorney for me, in my name and on 
my behalf in my claim case No.A-SH-155/57 decided by appeal at 
Sukkur, in the court of Dy. Claims Commissioner, Sukkur, to 
conduct the said case, to make statements in the court, to make 
negotiation, 
to 
receive 
compensation 
book, 
to 
realize 

R.S.A. No. 56 of 2005. 
11
compensation, to file and withdraw documents, to engage 
advocates if necessary, to issue receipts and discharges, and to do 
all other lawful acts and things in connection with the realization 
of compensation of the said case as effectually as I could do if I 
were personally present.”  
 
Perusal of said special power of attorney it appears that it was 
notarized by the Notary Public at Karachi. It is evident from the 
record that respondent No.1 appointed Anwar Khan Lodhi as his 
attorney in appeal A-Sh-155/57 with regard to claim registration 
No.7 dated 07.07.1955. Perusal of order dated 08.04.1959 passed by 
Deputy Claims Commissioner Sukkur (available in the original file), 
it appears that while deciding review petition moved by predecessor 
of appellants and respondent No.1 passed certain observations. Said 
order disclosed that they were declared displaced persons and that 
their properties were taken by Bharti custodian of Evacuee Property. 
In pursuance of said order further progress was made for allotment of 
properties in lieu of their claim form. Suit property was also reserved 
and allotted in progress of said order. Respondent No.1 appoint 
Muhammad Anwar Khan his special attorney to pursue the matter. 
Therefore, it cannot be said that Muhammad Anwar Khan Lodhi was 
not attorney of respondent No.1 with regard to suit property.  
It is matter of record that said Muhammad Anwar Khan Lodhi 
used said special power of attorney in the Settlement and 
Rehabilitation Department. He posed himself as special attorney of 
respondent No.1 to get transfer the suit property in his name.   
24. 
In rebuttal, appellants produced D.W.1 Sajjad Hussain ASI 
who brought record of application moved by respondent No.1 and 
the proceedings of inquiry conducted upon said application.  
25. 
Muhammad Shahzad Khan got recorded his statement as 
D.W.2 and deposed that parties are his paternal uncle. He also 
deposed that with regard to the suit property a Punchayat was 
convened in their house wherein parties and his father and his 
paternal uncle Muhammad Nawaz were present and it was settled 
that suit plot would remain with Muhammad Anwar Khan Lodhi and 
his legal heirs. He further stated that he has seen possession of 
Muhammad Anwar Khan upon the suit property since his childhood. 

R.S.A. No. 56 of 2005. 
12
He disclosed during cross-examination that a compromise deed was 
executed and he did not know from whose possession now it is. He 
was unable to tell that from when Anwar Khan was became owner of 
the suit property. He did not know, why disputes were arisen 
between plaintiff and Anwar Khan. He further deposed that he was 
asked by Asif Khan (one of the appellants) to give evidence. One of 
the appellants namely Muhammad Asif Lodhi appeared as D.W.3 
and deposed that suit property is in their ownership and it was 
reserved to his father Anwar Khan Lodhi and allotted to him in the 
year 1960. P.T.D was issued in year the 1974. He further deposed 
that parentage of his father was wrongly written in Transfer Order 
which was later on corrected. He also deposed that dues of 
Rehabilitation Department with regard to the suit property were paid 
by his father. During cross-examination, he deposed that the 
reservation application was manipulated by respondent No.1. He 
stated that his father died in the year 1990-91. He stated the 
suggestion incorrect that price was paid by respondent No.1.  
26. 
Appellants produced copy of application for registration of 
case moved by respondent No.1 as Exh.D.1, copy of letter qua 
droppage of inquiry dated 05.06.2000 as Exh.D.2, revise final report 
as Exh.D.3 (author of said Rapat not produced by appellants and he 
also did not finally concluded the matter. His report is just his 
observation), copy of statement of Muhammad Nawaz Khan as 
Exh.D.4, copy of statement of Muhammad Ejaz Khan as Exh.D.5, 
copy of statement of Arshad Yar Khan as Exh.D.6 (said statements 
have no evidentiary value as neither they appeared before the Court 
to verify its contents nor they faced the music of cross-examination), 
copy of letter issued by the office of Deputy Settlement 
Commissioner as Exh.D.7 wherein A.K Lodhi was asked to deposit 
the remaining amount of Rs.4770 within one month, copy of notice

Khan Lodhi No.62584 dated 14.07.1994  as Exh.D.15.  
27. 
It is evident from the above referred evidence that 
consideration amount of the suit property was settled as Rs.4770/-. 
Said amount was paid by respondent No.1 through amount adjusted 
vide CB No.1433/30607 and challan form dated 28.02.1974. Amount 
of Rs.2826/- was adjusted from the account of Muhammad Naeem 
Khan who deposited the same in the PTD case of House No.153, 
Block-E, D.G. Khan. In this regard, respondent No.1 produced a 
deed of agreement dated 29.09.1964 (Exh.P-5) wherein Muhammad 
Naeem Khan agreed that amount of Rs.2826/- be adjusted from C.B. 
No.DGK-1433/30607 and gave authority to respondent No.1 to 
utilize his compensation book. This is a very important document for 
reaching a just conclusion. It was stated in it as under:-

payment of price of plot No.19/20 Khasra No.9976 (suit property). 
28. 
Said fact was verified by Exh.P.11, copy of record of 
Settlement/Rehabilitation Department (Register for payment of price 
of evacuee property) wherein execution of the agreement was 
specifically mentioned by stating that an agreement with regard to 
compensation book No.DGK-1433 is attached with the file but it was 
not sanctioned and through this agreement amount Rs.2826/- was 
received. Exact wording in verbatim is written as under:-

In this document, in the column of particular of transaction it 
is mentioned that amount adjusted vide order of DSC and in column 
reference to order relating to transaction, number of compensation 
book is mentioned as C.B.1433/30607 and the amount adjusted is

Amount of Rs.1944/- was paid by respondent No.1 through 
Fayyaz Muhammad Khan vide challan form dated 28.02.1974 
(Exh.P-3). This fact is also mentioned in Exh.P.11 and has been 
shown to be deposited on 28.02.1974. After payment of Rs.1944/- 
total amount paid is shown Rs.4770/- and account was shown to be

closed. Settlement fee of Rs.23.86 was also paid on behalf of 
respondent No.1 through challan form (Exh.P-4).  
30. 
An application dated 29.09.1964 (Exh.P.1) was moved on 
behalf of respondent No.1 through Muhammad Anwar Khan and 
sought permission from Deputy Settlement Commissioner for 
payment of balance transferred price of Rs.2826/- through C.B 
No.1433.  
31. 
Another application was also moved on behalf of respondent 
No.1 on 06.01.1966 (Exh.P.2) for issuance of P.T.O. This 
application was also moved through special attorney namely A.K. 
Lodhi. An application for issuance of Permanent Transfer Order was 
moved on behalf of respondent No.1 bearing registration No.6340 
dated 31.03.1965 (Exh.P.6). In this application, (which is on a 
prescribed performa for issuance of evacuee property), name of 
applicant was shown Muhammad Iqbal Khan (respondent No.1) and 
in the column particulars of evacuee property Khasra No.9976, 
Block No.E, Mall No.19-20, city Dera Ghazi Khan, District Dera 
Ghazi Khan were entered. Said application also disclosed price of 
plot Rs.4770/-, settlement fee Rs.23.85 and issuance of challan form 
on 31.03.1965. Said application moved on 31.03.1965 by Anwar 
Khan Lodhi (Muhammad Iqbal) through Syed Azmat Ali. Copy of 
Challan Form (Exh.P.4) is showed that it was issued for payment of 
settlement fee Rs.23.85 on 31.03.1965 and paid on 01.04.1965 by 
respondent No.1.  
32. 
Application dated 09.11.1960 (Exh.P.7) was moved from A.K 
Lodhi on behalf of respondent No.1 wherein it was prayed that suit 
plot may be reserved and transferred in the name of Muhammad 
Iqbal. It is also evident that on the said application plot was reserved 
for the applicant i.e., Muhammad Iqbal Khan Lodhi (respondent 
No.1). PTO No.090375 dated 31.12.1960 (Exh.P.8/Exh.D.10) was 
issued in the name of A.K. Lodhi but it is a Provisional Transfer 
Order issued on the basis of an application dated 09.11.1960 
(Exh.P.7) moved on behalf of respondent No.1.   

R.S.A. No. 56 of 2005.

33. 
Through letter (Exh.D.7) A.K. Lodhi (predecessor of 
appellants) was informed in the year 1961 that suit property was 
reserved for him and he was required to deposit the remaining 
amount Rs.4770/- within one month. Appellants produced notice 
No.344 
dated 
12.07.1967 
(Exh.D.8) 
and 
notice 
No.1384/DSC/2aR/75 
dated 
13.12.1975 
(Exh.D.9) 
wherein 
predecessor of appellants namely Anwar Khan Lodhi was asked to 
pay transfer price Rs.4470/- within 30 days. There is no evidence 
available on record from appellants‟ side that Anwar Khan Lodhi 
paid said amount. Appellants did not produce any document or 
challan about the payment of consideration amount of suit property. 
Whereas, record transpires that said payment was made by 
respondent No.1 through challan (Exh.P.3) and deed of agreement 
(Exh.P.5). Most of the documents produced by respondent No.1 are 
part of the public record and presumption of truth is attached to it.   
34. 
Appellants raised an objection in their written statement that 
Civil Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the suit. In this regard, 
learned Trial Court framed issue No.4 in the following terms: 
1. Whether the Civil Court has no jurisdiction to adjudicate the 
matter? OPD 
35. 
Contention of the learned counsel for the appellants is that the 
jurisdiction of Civil & Revenue Courts has been barred under the 
Repealing Acts.  
36. No doubt Section 25 of the Displaced Persons (Land Settlement) 
Act, 1958 (Act XLVII of 1958) and the Displaced Persons 
(Compensation & Rehabilitation), Act 1958 (Act XXVII of 1958) and 
Section 41 of the Pakistan (Administration of Evacuee Property) Act, 
1957 (Act XII of 1957), bar the jurisdiction of Civil & Revenue 
Courts wherein it was provided that if any person was aggrieved of 
any action or decision of Settlement Authority or Evacuee Authority, 
he had remedy of appeal, revision etc. and Civil & Revenue Courts 
have no jurisdiction to entertain said matters.  August Supreme Court 
of Pakistan remained consistent with regard to bar of jurisdiction by 

R.S.A. No. 56 of 2005. 
17
holding that Civil Courts have no jurisdiction to entertain such like 
cases.  
37. 
Now the question arises that after repeal of the Act, 1957 and 
the Act, 1958 through the Evacuee Property and Displaced Persons 
Laws (Repeal) Act, 1975 [Act XIV of 1975], bar of the jurisdiction 
of Civil Courts to call in question of the character of property and its 
alienation by the settlement Authority existed or not? The Hon‟ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan while answering this question in its 
judgment reported as “NAZEER AHMAD and others versus 
GHULAM MEHDI and others” (1988 SCMR 824) held that the 
argument that with the repeal of the Act of 1957, the bar contained in 
section 41 on the jurisdiction of Civil Court was also wiped off is 
untenable, in the following terms: -  
“Section 41 of the Pakistan (Administration of Evacuee Property) 
Act, 1957, explicitly bars the jurisdiction of the Civil Court in clear 
and unambiguous terms and as such no Civil Court can give 
declaration about the status of a person or property being evacuee 
or non-evacuee. The order of the Custodian dated, 10th June, 1963, 
on which reliance is placed for challenging the validity of the 
subsequent order of the Custodian, dated 29th March, 1974, has 
not been shown to relate to the disputed property, therefore, the 
very basis of the claim set up in the suit appears to us to be 
groundless. Additionally this appears to be a new case set up in the 
suit in that the appellants did not rely upon the previous order of 
the Custodian passed in 1963 when they themselves moved the 
Custodian subsequently to obtain declaration with regard to the 
status of the property now in dispute. The reason appears to be 
obvious that the previous order did not relate to the property now 
the subject matter of dispute. In the light of the forgoing, the claim 
of the appellants in the suit substantially was to call in question the 
subsequent order of the Custodian which did relate to the disputed 
property but was protected from challenge in the civil Court under 
the existing law by virtue of Section 41 of the Act of 1957 and as 
stated above, the repeal of the said Act did not have the effect of 
removing the bar of the General Clauses Act so far as the orders 
passed during the operation of the repealed law. The arguments 
that with the repeal of the Act of 1957, the bar contained in section 
41 on the jurisdiction of the civil Court was also wiped off is 

R.S.A. No. 56 of 2005. 
18
untenable. This being the position, upsetting the order of the Court 
below merely for the reason that the Court was not competent to 
look outside the averments made in the plaint would amount to 
merely pressing a technicality.” (Emphasize supplied) ion and 
jurisdiction is clearly barred to entertain the suit involving 
disputes of title relating to the evacuee property and with regard to 
orders passed by the Settlement Authorities.  
38.  
The maxim “Ubi jus ibi remedium” (wherever there is a right, 
there is a remedy), is a fundamental principle of law. By virtue of 
section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 granted general 
jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature unless the jurisdiction of 
the Court is barred. Although said Section indicates that Civil Courts 
cannot try suits in respect of which their jurisdiction is expressly or 
impliedly barred under any law, but proceedings challenged as 
coram-non-judice are not covered by the exceptions contained in it. 
39. 
This Court in a case titled “IQBAL KHAN AND 9 OTHERS 
VERSUS SHAHID ULLAH BAIG AND ANOTHER” (1989 CLC 
1265) held that:-  
“After the repeal Act XII of 1957 the only forum to determine 
whether a property is available property or not, is the Civil 
Court and not the Residual Authorities”  
 
 
This Court in a judgment titled “Wazir Hussain V. Abdul 
Rehman through Legal Heirs & another (2002 YLR 1600)” held as 
under:  
“Through the suit the plaintiff sought a declaration that P.T.O 
dated 16.12.1963 and P.T.D dated 24.06.1971 procured by 
defendant was result of fraud and forgery. Inter-alia other reliefs 
of right of transfer were also prayed. Civil Court is a Court of 
plenary jurisdiction. The question of fraud & forgery is 
determinable only by the Civil Court, particularly in the settlement 
cases, where after the repeal of Settlement Laws no other forum is 
available for adjudicating such dispute. Notified Officer appointed 
under the Repeal Act do not possess jurisdiction to declare P.T.O 
& P.T.D as illegal, null & void on the ground of fraud & forgery. 
After repeal of Settlement Laws, this jurisdiction only vested with 
the Civil Court.”  

R.S.A. No. 56 of 2005. 
19
And in another case titled as “MST. KUBRA BEGUM AND 
OTHERS VERSUS SHAMS DIN AND ANOTHER” (2014 YLR 
1456) held that  
“after the repeal of Settlement Laws the ultimate jurisdiction only vests 
with Civil Court”.  
 
40. 
The main allegation leveled by the respondent No.1 is 
that predecessor of the appellants had obtained P.T.O and T.O 
in his favour by practicing fraud, therefore, the question for 
determination would be whether forgery and fraud had been 
committed by him in obtaining P.T.O and T.O in his favour. 
Where question of fraud, forgery or misrepresentation is 
involved, unless specifically barred under law, the jurisdiction 
remains with the Civil Court to decide such issue.  
41. 
In case titled “Muhammad Rafique V. Abdul Ghafoor” 
(1992 SCMR 1971), august Court of Pakistan held as under: 
“As regards the first contention, the learned Addl. District Judge 
in the first round of litigation before the Civil Courts had held that 
since fraud was involved, the Civil Courts had the jurisdiction. He 
remanded the case for decision on merits. This order, dated 
21.02.1982 was not challenged by the appellant. He took a chance 
to succeed in remand proceedings. Having failed, he cannot turn 
round and say that the Courts had no jurisdiction. In any case, in 
view of the leave granting order, the question was examined 
whether in exercise of suo-motu jurisdiction, the order of the 
learned Addl. District Judge should be allowed to stand. The 
learned Addl. District Judge had held that in view of the fraud 
alleged (in getting the mutations sanctioned) which matter could 
not be adjudicated upon the authorities, the Civil Courts had the 
jurisdiction. It may be noted that the litigation was going on before 
the relevant authorities until the law under which they exercised 
jurisdiction i.e. settled law was repealed, therefore, recourse could 
be had to the Civil Courts possessed of plenary jurisdiction to 
determine the dispute.” 
August Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case titled “Sultan 
Hassan Khan & 02 others V. Mst. Naseem Jahan & 17 others (1994 
SCMR 150) held as under: 

R.S.A. No. 56 of 2005. 
20
“The main allegation in the suit filed by the plaintiffs/respondents 
is that the petitioners’ predecessor-in-interest had obtained P.T.D 
in his favour on the basis of forged documents and by practicing 
fraud. The question therefore to be considered would be whether 
forgery and fraud have been committed by the petitioners’ 
predecessor-in-interest in obtaining P.T.D. in his favour. Such 
question cannot be decided by the departmental authorities. Where 
question of fraud, forgery or mis-representation is involved, unless 
specifically barred under the law, the jurisdiction remains with the 
Civil Court to decide such issue.”  
 
In another case, august Supreme Court of Pakistan held that 
after repeal of Settlement Laws factual controversy could be resolved 
by Civil Court of plenary jurisdiction for reference “Muhammad 
Ayub through L.Rs. & others V. Ghulam Muhammad & other (2005 
SCMR 1650), whereby observed as under: 
“After the repeal of Settlement Laws all these factual controversies 
could be resolved by the Civil Courts of plenary jurisdiction. It is 
to be appreciated that in the declaratory suits exception was taken 
to the order of the Settlement Authority dated 23.04.1974 which 
suit was dismissed being not maintainable. In these circumstances, 
no illegality has been committed by the learned Single Judge in 
remanding the case to the Trial Court to judge the veracity of the 
Transfer Order.” 
 
  
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in case titled “Begum 
Syeda Azra Masood V. Begum Noshaba Moeen & others (2007 
SCMR 914), declared that ouster clause in any statute only applies 
when authorities constituted therein act within four corners of the 
statutes and held as under: 
“The Law is clearly settled that an ouster clause in any statute will 
only apply when the authorities constituted therein act within the 
four corners of statute and if they step out of it, the protection 
available to the orders passed by a Tribunal of special jurisdiction 
is no more available and Court of plenary jurisdiction could 
examine the controversy.” 
 
It was also held that: 
“We will also like to observe that Transfer Order in favour of Mr. 
Saleem Ullah Baig was issued on 29.06.1974 and on 30.06.1974. 
Evacuee laws were repealed by virtue of Displaced Persons & 

R.S.A. No. 56 of 2005. 
21
Evacuee Laws (Repeal) Ordinance (No.XV) of 1974, while the suit 
was filed after repeal of laws. When an illegal order of transfer 
was sought to be enforced against the plaintiffs-respondents. Thus, 
even on this score, the Civil Court had jurisdiction.  
 
 
August Supreme Court of Pakistan in its recent 
judgment cited as “Muhammad Deen V. The Deputy Settlement 
Commissioner & others” (2022 SCMR 1481), held as under: 
“It hardly needs reiteration that after the promulgation of the 
Repealing Act, the Officers notified under that Act do not possess 
the jurisdiction to declare any P.T.O or P.T.D. regarding which no 
proceedings were pending on the cutoff date, as null & void on the 
grounds of alleged fraud or forgery; they can only deal with and 
decide the pending proceedings and cannot initiate any new 
proceedings. Anyone who wants to challenge any P.T.O or P.T.D 
issued under the repealed laws, and has locus standi to do so, is to 
knock at the doors of Civil Court, a Court of plenary jurisdiction 
for the redress of his grievance.”  
 
42. 
In view of above discussion and in the light of guidance 
sought from the case laws referred supra, I am of the considered 
opinion that the suit of respondent No.1 was maintainable as the 
Civil Court had plenary jurisdiction to entertain the same. Findings 
of learned Courts below qua this particular point are upheld.  
43. 
Appellants also raised another objection that the suit of 
respondent No.1 is not within time. Learned Trial Court in this 
regard framed issue No.7 as under: 
7.  
Whether the suit is barred by limitation? OPD 
44. 
Learned counsel for the appellants maintains that the P.T.O 
was issued in the year 1960, T.O was issued in the year 1974, 
therefore, for filing a suit the limitation was six years maximum as 
provided under Article 120 of the Limitation Act, 1908 but the suit 
was instituted on 09.10.1996 which is clearly barred by time. 
Whereas, learned counsel for respondent No.1 maintains that 
plaintiff stated in the plaint and evidence that he gained knowledge 
of wrong entries in the record only a few weeks before the institution 
of the suit. He filed an application to A.D.C (G) for the correction of 

R.S.A. No. 56 of 2005. 
22
the record wherein ADC(G) directed him to approach the Civil Court 
for redressal of his grievance. Respondent No.1 in his plaint 
categorically maintained that he came to know about the fraud and 
forgery committed by predecessor of the appellants in procuring the 
impugned P.T.O and T.O few weeks ago. Where fraud and forgery is 
alleged, the time is computed from the date of knowledge. There is 
no evidence on record which showing earlier knowledge of the 
respondent No.1 in respect of factum of issuance of P.T.O and T.O in 
favour of predecessor of the appellants.  
45. It is well settled principle of law that fraud vitiates even the 
most solemn transaction. Any transaction based on fraud would be 
void. Limitation does not run against void transaction. Mere efflux of 
time did not extinguish the right of any party. Notwithstanding the 
bar of limitation, the matter can be considered on merit so as not to 
allow fraud to perpetuate. In this regard, I seek guideline from the 
cases of Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan reported as “PEER 
BAKHSH through LRs and others vs. Mst. KHANZADI and others” 
(2016 SCMR 1417);“Muhammad Iqbal versus Mukhtar Ahmad” 
(2008 SCMR 855)“Mst. Raj Bibi etc. versus Province of Punjab, 
etc.” (2001 SCMR 1591) and “Hakim Khan versus Nazeer Ahmad 
Lughmani” (1992 SCMR 1832). 
46. 
 
With regard to point of limitation, the august Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in case titled as “KHAN MUHAMMAD through 
L.Rs and others versus Mst. KHATOON BIBI and others” (2017 
SCMR 1476) held as under:- 
“As far as the question of limitation in filing suit for 
declaration is concerned, we also would like to discuss it in 
some detail. In general, the time provided for such suit under 
Article 120 of the Limitation Act, 1908 is six years. Different 
aspects regarding reckoning/calculating this period of 
limitation have been considered and some yardsticks have 
been settled by this Court in different nature of cases and the 
situation 
cropping-up 
according 
to 
the 
facts 
and 
circumstances of the cases. In the cases of simple correction 
of revenue record, it is settled by now that every fresh wrong 
entry in the record of rights would provide fresh cause of 
action provided the party aggrieved is in possession of the 
property as owner needless to say that it can be either 

R.S.A. No. 56 of 2005. 
23
physical or symbolic possession. Similarly, in the cases of 
claiming right of inheritance, it is well settled that the 
claimant becomes co-owner/co-sharer of the property left by 
the predecessor along with others the moment the predecessor 
dies and entry of mutations of inheritance is only meant for 
updating the revenue record and for fiscal purposes. If a 
person feels himself aggrieved of such entries, he can file a 
suit for declaration within six years of such wrong entries or 
knowledge. Any such repetition of the said entries in the 
revenue record would again give him a fresh cause of action 
or when the rights of anyone in the property are denied it 
would also give fresh cause of action. Similarly, it is again. 
settled by now that no limitation would run against the co-
sharer. We for instance can quote few judgments covering all 
these aspects like “Ghulam Ali and 2 others v. Mst.Ghulam 
Samar Naqvi” (PLD 1990 SC 1), “Riaz Ahmad and 2 others v. 
Additional District Judge and 2 others” (1999 SCMR 1328), 
“Mst. Suban v. Allah Ditta and others” (2007 SCMR 635), 
“Muhammad Anwar and 2 others v. Khuda Yar and 25 
others” (2008 SCMR 905) and “Mahmood Shah v. Syed 
Khalid Hussain Shah and others” (2015SCMR 869).  
 
 
August Supreme Court of Pakistan in judgment “Muhammad 
Yaqoob V. Mst. Sardaran Bibi & others (PLD 2020 SC 338), held as 
under: 
“In addition, any transaction/document which is the result of 
fraud of misrepresentation can neither be perpetuated nor can 
it be protected on the ground of expiry of the period of 
limitation, whenever such transaction is assailed in a Court of 
law.” 
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in its recent judgment 
while explaining effect of fraud in computing the limitation period in 
a reported case titled “Rabia Gula & others V. Muhammad Janan & 
others (2022 SCMR 1009)”, held as under: 
“Section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1908 ("Limitation Act") is the most 
pivotal provision providing relief in computing the limitation period, 
applicable to a person who claims to be deprived of the knowledge of his 
right to sue based on the fraud of the other party. That section is 
reproduced for ease of reference: 
18. Effect of fraud. Where any person having a right to institute a suit 
or make an application has, by means of fraud, been kept from the 
knowledge of such right or of the title on which it is founded, or where 
any document necessary to establish such right has been fraudulently 
concealed from him, the time limited for instituting a suit or making an 
application--- 
(a) against the person guilty of the fraud or accessory thereto, or 

R.S.A. No. 56 of 2005. 
24
(b) against any person claiming through him otherwise than in good 
faith and for a valuable consideration, 
shall be computed from the time when the fraud first became known to 
the person injuriously affected thereby, or, in the case of the concealed 
document, when he first had the means of producing it or compelling 
its production. 
In essence, this provision postpones the commencement of the 
limitation period in cases where a person is by means of fraud kept 
from the knowledge of his right to institute a suit. In such 
circumstances, the period of limitation commences from the date when 
the fraud first became known to the "person injuriously affected". Such 
injuriously affected person can, therefore, institute a suit within the 
limitation period specified for such suit in the First Schedule 
("Schedule") to the Limitation Act, but computing it from the date 
when he first had knowledge of the fraud, whereby he was kept from 
knowledge of his right to institute the suit. Thus, section 18 of 
Limitation Act is an umbrella provision that makes the limitation 
period mentioned in the Articles of the Schedule, begin to run from the 
time different from that specified therein.1 
8.4 
It is but fundamental to appreciate that the "fraud" stated in 
section 18 of the Limitation Act must not be confused with the fraud 
that constitutes cause of action, and creates a right to institute the suit 
for the relief prayed therein. The "fraud" envisaged in section 18 only 
relates to concealing, not creating, the right to sue, and thus affects 
only the limitation period, and has nothing to do with the cause of 
action and the relief prayed.2 
8.5 
It would, thus, be safe to hold that, when despite obtaining 
knowledge of such fraud and his right to sue, as mentioned in section 
18, the injuriously affected person does not institute the suit within the 
prescribed limitation period, no fresh period of limitation can be 
available to his legal heir(s) or any other person who derives his right 
to sue from or through him (the injuriously affected person);3 for once 
the limitation period begins to run, it does not stop as per section 9 of 
the Limitation Act. 
8.6 
Further, the definition of the term "plaintiff", as given in 
section 2(8) of the Limitation Act also has the effect of barring the 
fresh start of the limitation period for the legal heir(s) or any other 
person, who derives his right to sue from or through such injuriously 
affected person, as it provides that "plaintiff" includes any person from 
or through whom a plaintiff derives his right to sue. 
8.7 
Therefore, it is the date of knowledge of the "person injuriously 
affected" of the fraud mentioned in section 18, and of his right to sue 
that is relevant for computing the limitation period, not of his legal 
heir(s), unless he asserts and prove that his predecessor (the person 
injuriously affected) never came to know of the fraud, whereby his 
right to institute the suit was concealed, in his lifetime; in the latter 
eventuality, it is, of course, the knowledge of the present plaintiff (his 
successor) that would be the starting point for the limitation to run. 
8.8 
Needless to mention that, a plaintiff who wants to avail the 
benefit of section 18 of the Limitation Act must assert the commission 
of such fraud by the defendant, in the plaint, and should also give the 
particulars thereof, and the date of knowledge, as required under Rule 
4 of Order VI of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908, and then prove the 
same through positive evidence.” 
 
It was further held that:

Thus, the limitation period of six years provided in Article 120 
of the Limitation Act is to be computed from the time mentioned in the 
said Article, that is, when the right to sue accrued. It reads: 

R.S.A. No. 56 of 2005. 
25

Six years. 
When the right 
to sue accrues. 
The provision clearly declares that for computing the limitation, the 
period of six years would commence from the date of accrual of right 
to sue, but it does not state when such right accrues. To ascertain, 
when does the right to sue accrue to a donor, to seek a declaration of 
his ownership right over the property shown to have been gifted and of 
his such right not to be affected by the gift mutation, we have to 
consider another provision of law, that is, section 42 of the Specific 
Relief Act. 
8.12 
A suit for declaration of any right, as to any property is filed 
under section 42 of the Specific Relief Act, which reads: 
 
42. Discretion of Court as to declaration of status or right--- 
Any person entitled to any legal character, or to any right as to any 
property, may institute a suit against any person denying, or interested 
to deny, his title to such character or right, and the Court may in its 
discretion make therein a declaration that he is so entitled, and the 
plaintiff need not in such suit ask for any further relief: 
 
Provided that no Court shall make any such declaration where 
the plaintiff, being able to seek further relief than a mere declaration 
of title, omits to do so. 
(Emphasis added) 
It becomes evident by reading the above provisions that the right to 
sue accrues to a person against the other for declaration of his right, 
as to any property, when the latter denies or is interested to deny his 
such right. It thus postulates two actions that cause the accrual of right 
to sue, to an aggrieved person: (i) actual denial of his right or (ii) 
apprehended or threatened denial of his right. 
8.13 Now, what "actions" can be termed as an "actual denial of right", 
and what a mere "apprehended or threatened denial of right", in the 
context of adverse entries recorded in the revenue record. It is 
important to note that a person may ignore an "apprehended or 
threatened denial" of his right taking it not too serious to dispel that by 
seeking a declaration of his right through instituting a suit, and may 
exercise his option to institute the suit, when he feels it necessary to do 
so, to protect his right. For this reason, every "apprehended or 
threatened denial" of right gives a fresh cause of action and right to 
sue to the person aggrieved of such apprehension or threat. However, 
this option to delay the filing of the suit is not available to him in case 
of "actual denial" of his right; where if he does not challenge the 
action of actual denial of his right, despite having knowledge thereof, 
by seeking declaration of his right within the limitation period 
provided in the Limitation Act, then his right to do so becomes barred 
by law of limitation.”

In the light of above discussion, suit of respondent No.1 was 
within the limitation, hence, learned Courts below have rightly 
decided issued No.7 qua limitation against the appellants and in 
favour of respondent No.1. I also endorse the findings of Courts 
below on this particular  issue.  

R.S.A. No. 56 of 2005.

48. 
Vide separate order, all the pending C.Ms in this appeal have 
also been decided.  
49.  
For the foregoing reasons, the learned Courts below have 
rightly decreed the suit of respondent No.1 while appreciating the 
evidence available on the file in its true perspective. The learned 
counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants failed to satisfy the 
Court with regard to presence of basic ingredients of regular second 
appeal that the impugned judgments and decrees are contrary to law 
or failed to determine material issue of law, or usage having the force 
of law; committed a substantial error or defect in the procedure 
provided by C.P.C, or by other law for the time being in-force, which 
may possibly have produced error or defect in the decision of the 
case upon the merits.  
50. 
I have seen no illegality, material irregularity and mis-
reading or non-reading of evidence on the part of learned Courts 
below while passing the impugned judgment and decree.  
51. 
Epitome of above discussion is that there is no force/substance 
in instant Regular Second Appeal, hence, the same is hereby 
dismissed with no order as to costs.
