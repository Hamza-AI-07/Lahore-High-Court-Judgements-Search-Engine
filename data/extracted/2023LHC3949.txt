SULTAN TANVIR AHMAD, J:–  Through 
the present petition, filed under Article 199 of the Constitution 
of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the petitioner has 
assailed order dated 23.11.2022 passed by learned Special 
Judge (Rent), Lahore (the „rent tribunal’).  
2.  
Facts, necessary for the decision of the present 
petition, are that Muhammad Ilyas Sulehri son of Chaudhary 
Shah Din (the „respondent’) instituted ejectment petition 
dated 14.11.2019, under section 19 of the Punjab Rented 
Premises Act, 2009 (the „Act’) for eviction of Mst. Nasira 
Bibi wife of Saeed Ahmad (the „petitioner’) from house No. 
55, phase-II, Ameer-ud-Din Park, Tajpura Lahore Cantt, 
Lahore as further detailed in the ejectment petition (the

„premises‟). The petitioner filed leave to defend the ejectment 
petition, inter alia, on the ground that the petitioner purchased 
the premises fifteen years ago and since then she is in lawful 
possession of the premises for which separate suit for 
declaration is pending adjudication. She was granted leave to 
defend the ejectment petition and after framing the relevant 
issues, the process of recording of evidence in terms of 
section 25 of the Act was initiated. The respondent after 
produced two witnesses closed the oral evidence for which 
statement dated 23.04.2022 of the learned counsel of the 
respondent is part of the record. Thereafter, the respondent 
instituted an application for producing further oral evidence 
and certain additional documents including a DVD allegedly 
containing voice recording of telephonic conversation 
between the respondent and the petitioner as well as her 
husband (the „voice recording’). The learned rent tribunal 
vide order dated 23.11.2022 partially allowed the application, 
which has been assailed in this constitutional petition. This 
petition is pressed to the extent of permission given by the 
learned rent tribunal to produce the voice recording. 
3.  
 Mr. Muhammad Iqbal Ghani-learned counsel 
for the petitioner has submitted that impugned order is passed 
in violation of section 19(3) of the Act, which requires that all 
the documents relied by an ejectment petitioner must be 
appended with the ejectment petition at the time of institution 
of such petition. He submitted that command of law has not 
been followed by the learned rent tribunal. Learned counsel 
for the petitioner has further contended that even if the 
principles of equity and fairness are followed and / or the case 
is examined on touchstone of the relevant provisions of the 
Civil Procedure Code, 1908 (the „Code’), the application is 
bound to fail as the respondent has not given „sufficient cause‟

or reasonable explanation in the application for not producing 
the voice recording at the time of institution of the ejectment 
petition. He has relied upon case titled “Muslim Commercial 
Bank Limited Versus Syed Ahmad Saeed Kirmani” (1991 CLC 
140) to convince the Court that the conversation sought to be 
produced is inadmissible as it is not pleaded in the ejectment 
petition; that evidence cannot be led beyond pleadings. The 
learned counsel raised serious objections on the permission to 
adduce private conversation of a lady while relying on the 
cases titled “Zafar Iqbal and Others Versus Bashir Ahmad and 
another”(PLD 1988 Supreme Court 109), “Nawab Din 
through 
Legal 
Representatives 
Versus 
Said 
and 
6 
Others”(2005 YLR 2024) and “Muhammad Younus Versus 
Mst. Kaniz Fatima”(PLD 2000 Karachi 348). Conversely, 
Mr. Attiq-ur-Rehman Mughal-learned counsel for the 
respondent has opposed this petition. He has stated that section 
19(3) or 22(3) are not mandatory provisions of law; that it has 
already been settled that section 34 of the Act does not oust the 
principles of fairness and equity to completely preclude the 
ejectment petitioners from producing documents, which are not 
appended with the ejectment petition.

Heard. Documents available on the file have 
been perused.    
4.    
Mr. Attiq-ur-Rehman Mughal has relied upon 
case titled “Dr. Sajjad Nazir Versus Special Judge Rent 
Tribunal, Lahore and 2 Others” (2017 CLC Note 131) 
whereby, this Court has observed that though the word “shall” 
is used in section 19(3) and 22(3) of the Act but since they are 
not followed by any consequence for non-compliance, the 
same cannot be termed or construed as mandatory. There is no 
gainsaying as to the same. I am also in agreement with the 

 
Writ Petition No. 80035 of 2022                                         (Judgment)

arguments of the learned counsel of the respondent that 
section 34 of the Act cannot be interpreted as ousting the 
equitable principles regulating procedure of the proceedings 
and the rent tribunals can invoke the such principles in interest 
of fairness and justice. However, the real question is if by 
construing section 19(3) of the Act as directory, the rent 
tribunal can be permitted to altogether ignore giving the due 
weight or significance to the said provisions or if it is at all in 
the interest of justice or fair play to permit the litigants to 
introduce new evidence at belated stages and by doing the 
same the relevant provisions are being rendered useless or 
redundant.  
5.  
By now it is well settled law that mandatory 
enactments require strict compliance. An act or thing in non-
adherence of the mandatory enactments is invalid. It is also 
equally settled that a provision of law when is determined as 
directory, its substantial compliance is obligatory. When 
needed in the interest of justice the minor deviations from 
directory laws can be overlooked provided that there is 
substantial compliance. It is duty of the Courts to attend the 
scheme of Act and then to carefully examine the concerned 
provisions to reach the intent of legislature and to give effect 
to the same. Reference can be made to the cases titled “The 
State through Regional Director ANF Versus Imam Bakhsh 
and Others” (2018 SCMR 2039), “Mafizullah Versus Manai 
Ullah and Others” (PLD 1963 Dacca 318), “S.N. Nagaraja 
Rao Vs. Chikkachennappa and Ors.” (1981 (1) Kar LJ 201) 
and “Shri Harish. Chandra Mishra and Others Versus The 
Hon’ble Mr. Justice S. Ali Ahmed, Opposite Party” (AIR 
1986 PATNA 65).

In the “The State through Regional Director

ANF” case (supra) the Supreme Court of Pakistan has 
concluded that non-compliance of directory provisions might 
not invalidate an act but as it provides legislative process 
based on public interest, transparency and good governance, 
its substantial compliance is necessary. It will be further  
beneficial to reproduce paragraph 11 of the said judgment, 
which reads as follows: - 
 
“To distinguish where the directions of the 
legislature are imperative and where they are 
directory, the real question is whether a thing has 
been ordered by the legislature to be done and what 
is the consequence, if it is not done. Some rules are 
vital and go to the root of matter, they cannot be 
broken; others are only directory and a breach of 
them can be overlooked provided there is 
substantial compliance. The duty of the court is to 
try to unravel the real intention of the legislature. 
This exercise entails carefully attending to the 
scheme of the Act and then highlighting the 
provisions that actually embody the real purpose 
and object of the Act. A provision in a statute is 
mandatory if the omission to follow it renders the 
proceedings to which it relates illegal and void, 
while a provision is directory if its observance is not 
necessary to the validity of the proceedings. Thus, 
some parts of a statute may be mandatory whilst 
others may be directory. It can even be the case that 
a certain portion of a provision, obligating 
something to be done, is mandatory in nature whilst 
another part of the same provision, is directory, 
owing to the guiding legislative intent behind it. Even 
parts of a single provision or rule may be mandatory 
or directory. “In each case one must look to the 
subject matter and consider the importance of the 

 
Writ Petition No. 80035 of 2022                                         (Judgment) 
 
 
6 
provision disregarded and the relation of that 
provision to the general object intended to be 
secured.” “Crawford opined that “as a general rule, 
[those provisions that]relate to the essence of the 
thing to be performed or to matters of substance, are 
mandatory, and those which do not relate to the 
essence and whose compliance is merely of 
convenience 
rather 
than 
of 
substance, 
are 
directory.” In another context, whether a statute or 
rule be termed mandatory or directory would depend 
upon larger public interest, nicely balanced with the 
precious right of the common man. According to 
Maxwell, “Where the prescription of statute relates 
to the performance of a public duty and where the 
invalidation of acts done in neglect of them would 
work serious general inconvenience or injustice to 
persons who have no control over those entrusted 
with the duty without promoting the essential aims of 
the legislature, such prescriptions seem to be 
generally understood as mere instructions for the 
guidance and government of those on whom the duty 
is imposed or in other words as directory only. The 
neglect of them may be penal indeed, but it does not 
affect the validity of the act done in disregard of 
them.” Our Court has held while determining the 
status of a mandatory or directory provision that 
“perhaps the cleverest indicator is the object and 
purpose of the statute and the provision in question.” 
And to see the “legislative intent as revealed by the 
examination of the whole Act.”

In order to further appreciate the arguments of 
the two sides, it is expedient to reproduce the relevant 
provisions of the Act.

Section 19. Filing of Application. -  
(1) An application in respect of a rented premises shall be 
filed in the Rent Tribunal of the area or the district.  
(2) If an application is filed under sub-section (1), the 
Administrative Special Judge (Rent) of the area or the 
district may take cognizance of the case or entrust the 
same to any other Special Judge (Rent.) 
(3) An application under sub-section (1) shall contain a 
concise statement of facts, the relief claimed and shall 
be accompanied by copies of all relevant documents in 
possession of the applicant. 
(4)  If the application is for eviction of a tenant, the 
landlord shall submit his affidavit and affidavits of not 
more than two witnesses along with the eviction 
application. 
 
Section 22. Leave to contest. -  
(1) A Rent Tribunal shall not allow a respondent to defend 
the application unless he obtains leave to contest. 
(2) Subject to this Act, a respondent shall file an 
application for leave to contest within ten days of his 
first appearance in the Rent Tribunal. 
(3) An application for leave to contest shall be in the form 
of a written reply, stating grounds on which the leave is 
sought and shall be accompanied by an affidavit of the 
respondent, copy of all relevant documents in his 
possession and, if desired, affidavits of not more than 
two witnesses.  
(4) The Rent Tribunal shall not allow leave to contest to a 
respondent unless the application discloses sufficient 
grounds for production of oral evidence. 
(5) The Rent Tribunal shall decide the application for leave 
to contest within a period of fifteen days from the date 
of its filing. 
(6) If the leave to contest is refused or the respondent has 
failed to file application for leave to contest within the 
stipulated time, the Rent Tribunal shall pass the final 
order. 
Section 25. Recording of evidence. - 
(1) At the time of grant of leave to contest, the Rent 
Tribunal shall direct a party to produce his evidence 
on a date fixed. 
(2) The Rent Tribunal shall treat an affidavit filed by a 
party as evidence and- 
(a) may, of its own motion, order the attendance of 
deponent for cross examination; and 

 
Writ Petition No. 80035 of 2022                                         (Judgment) 
 
 
8 
(b) shall, if so requested by a party, direct production 
of the deponent for cross examination. 
(3) The Rent Tribunal shall not grant more than two 
opportunities to a party for production of the 
evidence. 
(4) The Rent Tribunal shall not grant an adjournment for 
cross examination of a witness except for a sufficient 
cause and on payment of the costs to the witness as it 
may deem fit.  
(5) After recording the evidence of the parties, if any, and 
hearing the arguments, the Rent Tribunal shall pass 
the final order. 
 
Section 27. Period for disposal of application. -  
(1) The Rent Tribunal shall pass a final order on an 
application as expeditiously as possible but not latter 
than four months from the date of filing of the 
application. 
(2) If the final order is not passed on an application within 
the period of four months, the Rent Tribunal shall 
conduct the proceedings on day to day basis. 
 
 
Reading of above provisions, keeping in view the 
object as well as the scheme of the Act, leads to irresistible 
conclusion that the legislature has intended that in order to 
resolve dispute of landlords and tenants in quick, expeditious 
and cost-effective manners the litigants should provide copies 
of all documents in their possession that they want to rely 
upon, at initial stage, by appending them with ejectment 
petition or leave petition, as the case may be. The pleadings 
are required to be accompanied by affidavits of witnesses and 
if the leave is granted the affidavits can be treated as 
examination-in-chief. The legislature has provided time 
limitation of ten days to file leave application from the date of 
first appearance of the defender before the rent tribunals. 
Time period is provided to complete almost every step of the 
proceedings and then in section 27 of the Act it is expected 
from rent tribunals to dispose of such cases as expeditiously 
as possible. 
8.  
Any inadvertent defect in following the aforesaid 

 
Writ Petition No. 80035 of 2022                                         (Judgment)

provisions can be cured exceptionally, when explanation is 
available to the satisfaction of the rent tribunals, which can 
give permission in compelling needs to safeguard the interest 
of justice that too after recording reasons for grant of such 
permission. The litigant to proceeding under the Act are not 
allowed to adduce evidence in non-adherence of above 
reproduced provisions, as a right or matter of course or in  
routine. In “Khalil-ur-Rehman and another Versus Dr. 
Manzoor Ahmed and Others” (PLD 2011 Supreme Court 
512) section 22(3) of the Punjab Rent Premises Ordinance, 
2007 (repealed) was interpreted. The said provision is 
identical to the present section 22(3) of the Act. Upon 
interpretation of the same the following law is laid down: -  
“6. The second part of the section 
commands that the application should be 
accompanied by the affidavit of the 
respondent. As it is an express requirement 
of the law, and it is settled by now that 
where the law requires an act to be done 
or performed in a particular manner it 
has to be accordingly done / performed 
and not otherwise, besides, it is also the 
rule of law that where an application / 
pleading should be supported by an 
affidavit under a statutory provision which 
is not filed, such application shall not be 
maintainable. However, the defect in this 
behalf is curable, but only in those cases 
where 
a 
‘sufficient 
cause’ 
and 
‘reasonable explanation’ is propounded 
by the respondent for not filing his 
affidavit along with the leave application, 
otherwise such defect should not be 
permitted to be cured by the Tribunal as a 
matter of course or routine; to this extent 
the provisions are mandatory.” 
(Emphasis supplied)  
 
 9.  
Reverting to the facts of the case. The ejectment 
petition was filed in the year 2019. After grant of leave, 

 
Writ Petition No. 80035 of 2022                                         (Judgment) 
 
 
10 
petitioner completed the process of producing oral evidence 
and learned counsel gave statement dated 23.4.2022 to close 
the same. When the case was fixed for producing 
documentary evidence, an application was filed to produce 
several documents, which were not appended with ejectment 
petition. Some of them were permitted and not objected by the 
present petitioner but the voice recording. The reason that 
prevailed with the learned rent tribunal to give permission to 
produce voice recording is given in paragraph 6 of the order 
assailed that reads as under: - 
“6… So far as the prayer regarding 
submission of (f) DVD of voice recording 
of telephone calls of the respondent is 
concerned; it is alleged by the petitioner 
that the respondent as well as her husband 
promised to pay the rent of demised 
premises on phone call which was 
recorded and transcript of the same is 
available in shape of DVD. As per article 
164 of the Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 
1984 the court may allow to be produced 
any evidence that may have become 
available because of modern devices or 
techniques in such cases as the court may 
consider appropriate…”  
 
10.  
 
The learned counsel for the respondent has 
admitted before me that entire oral evidence from his side has 
been completed and dismissal for request to produce 
additional oral evidence has attained finality. When 
confronted that how the voice recording shall be produced, he 
has submitted that the same will be produced in without oath 
statement of learned counsel. The ground vis-à-vis production 
of the voice recording is set-up in para 3 of application, which 
does not disclose the date of such recording. There is no 
reason given in the application regarding failure to provide the 
voice recording at initial stage. The learned counsel for the 

 
Writ Petition No. 80035 of 2022                                         (Judgment) 
 
 
11 
respondent also remained unable to give any reason for failure 
as to non-compliance of law. Apparently, it also escaped view 
of the learned rent tribunal that before adverting to the 
question of admissibility, it was essential to state reasons for 
departure from the provisions of law or failure in substantial 
compliance. The respondent had to satisfy the learned rent 
tribunal as to those grounds on the basis of which they 
remained unable to produce this evidence or give notice in 
this regard at the previous stages of trial, which started in the 
year 2019. It was also incumbent to satisfy the learned rent 
tribunal as to how it is in interest of equity and fairness to 
permit the petitioner to produce the particular document at 
this belated stage. In my reading the application filed after 
about three years of ejectment petition for producing the voice 
recording lacks sufficient grounds to permit the same.  
11.  
Consequent upon above discussion, the order 
dated 23.11.2022 passed by the learned rent tribunal, to the 
extent of permission to produce the voice recording, is set-
aside. No order as to costs.  
Petition is allowed in the above terms.
