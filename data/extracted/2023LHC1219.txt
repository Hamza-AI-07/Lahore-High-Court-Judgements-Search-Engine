             Rasaal Hasan Syed, J. The instant second appeal is 
directed against judgments and decree dated 10.3.2011 and 
20.11.2014 in terms whereof the suit for declaration of 
respondent Nos.1 to 3 was decreed by the trial court and  
appeal thereagainst was dismissed by the first appellate court. 
2. 
Plaintiffs/respondent Nos.1 to 3 along with Mst. 
Surraya Begum, being widow and daughters of late Noor 
Ahmad, instituted a suit for declaration that they were the 
legal heirs of the deceased and were, as such, entitled to 
inherit the property as per their Islamic share. They also 
assailed the mutation of gift No.4467 dated 09.8.1993 in 
favour of late Muhammad Nawaz, predecessor of appellant 
Nos.1 and 2 as also the subsequent mutation No.4470 dated 
16.8.1993 in favour of appellant Nos.1 and 2, on the ground of 
being illegal, a result of impersonation and deceitful means 
and ineffective upon their right of inheritance. The suit was 
resisted by appellants/defendants, issues were framed, and

evidence was recorded whereafter the learned Civil Judge 
decreed the suit vide impugned judgment dated 10.3.2011. 
Appellants’ appeal thereagainst was dismissed by the learned 
Addl. District Judge, Kharian vide judgment dated 20.11.2014. 
In the instant appeal these judgments are now under challenge. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the 
findings on issue Nos.1 and 2 were based on misreading of 
evidence; mutation No.4470 dated 16.8.1993 was not a part of 
record and could not be adjudged adversely; there being no 
restriction on the right of the deceased to make gift in favour 
of one of his legal heirs i.e. his son, the respondents could not 
legally challenge the same and that the evidence on  record 
proved the gift and that the attorney had acted in accordance 
with the authority in the power of attorney and that the 
evidence was not correctly appreciated which vitiated the 
findings. Contrarily, learned counsel for the respondents 
supported the findings in the judgments of courts below and 
vehemently stressed that the same were based on correct 
appreciation of evidence and that no misreading and non-
reading was made and that the material on record proved 
beyond doubt that the respondent No.4 had no lawful authority 
to make any gift nor any gift could be independently proved 
and that the suit as also the appeal were rightly decided by the 
courts below. 
4. 
Points raised pro and contra have been minutely 
considered and evidence on record has duly been examined. 
Perusal thereof reveals that respondent Nos.1 to 3  along with 
Surraya Begum filed a suit for declaration as legal heirs of late 
Noor Ahmad claiming that the alleged power of attorney 
bearing document No.427 dated 09.6.1992 claimed by 
Muhammad Anwar respondent No.4 (defendant No.3 in the 
suit) was never executed by the deceased and that the same 
was a result of fraud and impersonation on the part of 

R.S.A. No.25 of 2015  
 
 
 
 
 
-3- 
 
 
 
Muhammad Nawaz deceased son of Noor Ahmad and that the 
property devolved upon the legal heirs of the deceased Noor 
Ahmad  i.e. respondents/plaintiffs proportionate to their 
Islamic shares and that the mutations subject matter of suit 
being 
fraudulent 
were 
untenable. 
Ruqayya 
Begum, 
respondent/plaintiff, 
appeared 
as 
P.W.1. 
Documentary 
evidence comprising Exh.P1 to Exh.P-5 was also tendered in 
evidence by the respondents/plaintiffs. In defense appellants 
produced Mumtaz Aziz D.W.1, as  special attorney of 
appellants.  
5. 
On analysis of the entire evidence, the courts below 
concurrently held that respondents/plaintiffs were the legal 
heirs of Noor Ahmad, being widow and daughters of 
deceased; no gift could be proved to have been made by the 
deceased in his lifetime; appellant Nos.1 and 2 being 
beneficiaries were bound to prove the execution of power of 
attorney and making of alleged gift in favour of Muhammad 
Nawaz by Noor Ahmad deceased either in England or in 
Pakistan but could not do so and that the alleged power of 
attorney did not have any power in terms of the document 
Exh.P-5 to make any gift on behalf of deceased Muhammad 
Nawaz, rather perusal thereof would reveal that it related to 
sale or mortgage and not to transfer by way of gift.   
6. 
Notwithstanding that in a second appeal concurrent 
findings of fact could not ordinarily be  challenged unless any 
serious  misreading of evidence was pointed out or serious  
questions of law were raised, yet for satisfaction the entire 
evidence was minutely examined. Scrutiny thereof shows that 
appellants’ claim was that the property of Noor Ahmad was 
allegedly gifted by him to his son Muhammad Nawaz, 
predecessor of appellant  Nos.1 and 2 vide mutation No.4467 
dated 9.8.1993 whereafter Muhammad Nawaz transferred the 
land in favour of his real sons appellant Nos.1 and 2 vide 

R.S.A. No.25 of 2015  
 
 
 
 
 
-4- 
 
 
 
mutation No.4470 dated 16.8.1993. The original power of 
attorney was not produced in evidence by the appellants. 
Muhammad Anwar the alleged attorney and defendant No.3 in 
the suit (respondent No.4 herein) also did not appear in the 
witness-box nor the appellants appeared in the witness-box. 
Rather they opted to produce Mumtaz Aziz D.W.1, their 
special attorney.  It was only the respondents/plaintiffs who 
tendered in evidence certified copy of the power of attorney 
Exh.P-5 for making reference of document to seek annulment 
thereof by the order of the court. In the instant case no witness 
of Exh.P-5 was produced to prove its execution nor 
Muhammad Anwar the alleged attorney entered appearance as 
witness. The case of the respondents was that no power of 
attorney was ever executed by Noor Ahmad and even if the 
power of attorney is taken in account yet Muhammad Anwar 
did not have any authority to either make a gift of property of 
Noor Ahmad or to transfer it by way of gift and that no gift 
was ever made by late Noor Ahmad.  
7. 
To prove gift, it was incumbent to allege and prove 
three mandatory ingredients. The declaration of gift, 
acceptance of gift and transfer of possession of the property. It 
was also necessary to specifically mention the time, place and 
names of persons in whose presence  these  prerequisites were 
performed. Neither these ingredients were mentioned in the 
written statement nor proved in evidence. D.W.1 did not claim 
making of gift in his presence nor any other evidence could be 
produced to prove that these three ingredients were fulfilled in 
their presence either in England or in his native country by 
Noor Ahmad deceased. It was, therefore, a case in which no 
affirmative admissible evidence could be produced by the 
appellants to prove making of any gift either in Pakistan or 
abroad by Noor Ahmad in favour of his son Muhammad 
Nawaz. The recitals of Exh.P-5 do not record any context of 

R.S.A. No.25 of 2015  
 
 
 
 
 
-5- 
 
 
 
transfer of the property by way of gift in favour of Muhammad 
Nawaz predecessor of appellant Nos.1 to 3 nor does the 
instrument in its operative part contain any covenant or clause 
delegating any authority to make gift for the transfer of 
property by way of gift. Rather the document speaks of 
transfer of the property by sale or mortgage. The courts below 
therefore, rightly concluded that Muhammad Anwar had no 
power to transfer the property of Noor Ahmad, by way of gift, 
as was claimed vide disputed mutation No.4467 dated 
09.8.1993 which mutation was obviously without lawful 
authority and legally untenable in view of the rule in “Mst. 
Bandi v. Province of Punjab and others” (2005 SCMR 1368) 
and “Mst. Shumal Begum v. Mst. Gulzar Begum and 3 others” 
(1994 SCMR 818). The  special attorney of appellant D.W.1 
also admitted that in his presence no gift was made and that 
Noor Ahmad had been cultivating the land himself as also 
through others during his lifetime.  
8. 
In “Faqir Ali and others v. Sakina Bibi and others” 
(PLD 2022 SC 85) it was observed to the effect that for a gift 
to be valid and binding three necessary conditions must be 
met, namely, declaration of gift by owner, acceptance by 
donee and delivery of possession of corpus and that a valid 
gift could also be effected orally if these three prerequisites 
were established through valid and cogent evidence and that 
written instrument was not a requirement under Mohammadan 
Law nor was it compulsorily registerable under the 
Registration Act, 1908 and that registration of the document 
shall be of no help if the three mandatory conditions remained 
unsatisfied. It was further observed to the effect that 
beneficiary of such document was bound not only to prove its 
execution but was also obligated to prove the gift itself by 
producing cogent and reliable evidence establishing the 
aforementioned three necessary conditions of a valid gift.

9. 
In the instant case the appellants were unable to 
produce any tangible evidence to prove the making of gift by 
the deceased in his lifetime nor Muhammad Anwar defendant 
No.3 could prove any valid authority to transfer the property 
on the basis of gift, particularly when no such power was 
vested by delegation in writing in the document. In “Ijaz 
Bashir Qureshi v. Shams-Un-Nisa Qureshi and others” (2021 
SCMR 1298)  while considering various aspects of the claim 
by way of gift by an attorney it was observed by the Supreme 
Court Of Pakistan as follows: 
“7. 
Now comes the question whether in a 
power of attorney if it is mentioned that the agent 
can transfer the property through gift, these powers 
are given to the agent to transfer the property 
himself or herself through gift, in our view the gift 
can be made by the owner/principal  only. The 
agent cannot himself or herself transfer the 
immovable property of principal through gift on the 
basis of any power of attorney even if the power of 
attorney contains the powers to transfer the 
property through gift. These powers can only be 
used for completion of codal formalities of the gift 
which 
must 
be 
by 
the 
owner/principal  
himself/herself. The attorney cannot transfer the 
property of principal himself/herself to anyone 
through gift and if that transfer is by the attorney 
himself/herself, that is invalid transfer.”   
           
10. 
Admittedly Muhammad Nawaz was the son of Noor 
Ahmad while the respondents/plaintiffs were the widow and 
daughters of deceased Noor Ahmad. No reason whatsoever 
was advanced to show as to why the deceased would like to 
deprive his real daughters and widow of their share and would 
give preference to the son by excluding the legal heirs in 
departure with Islamic injunctions. In “Barkat Ali through 
Legal Heirs and others v. Muhammad Ismail through Legal 
Heirs and others” (2002 SCMR 1938)  it was observed as 
follows: 

R.S.A. No.25 of 2015  
 
 
 
 
 
-7- 
 
 
 
“5…Though it is not necessary for a donor to 
furnish the reasons for making a gift yet no gift in 
the ordinary course of human conduct is made 
without reason or justification unless the donor is 
divested of all the power of reasoning and logic 
and unless he is a person of unsound mind. In  
the wake of frivolous gifts generally made to 
deprive females in the family from the course of 
inheritance prevalent at present times, the Courts 
are not divested of the powers to scrutinize the 
reasons and justification for a gift so that no 
injustice is done to the rightful owners and no 
course of inheritance is bypassed” 
11. 
In the Faqir Ali’s case supra it was observed to the 
effect that the only reason furnished by the alleged 
beneficiaries and their witness in their statements before the 
trial Court was that their father had transferred the suit land to 
gain divine favour of God by pleasing Him and the exact 
words used were “Allah Waasty”; that from this it was clear 
that natural love and affection was not the consideration of the 
gift; that even if the claim was accepted as true it was ex-facie 
hard to understand how depriving real daughters of their 
rightful share in the inheritance/estate of the donor could be 
interpreted as an act which would please Allah Who had 
specifically ordained that the daughters were entitled to a 
specified share by way of inheritance in the estate of their 
father; that it therefore appeared that the gifts were only a 
device to deprive the daughters from inheritance and the gift 
mutations were sanctioned to bypass the law of inheritance; 
and that gift being based on a fraudulent intent which vitiates 
even the most solemn transactions notwithstanding the bar of 
limitation Courts would not act as helpless bystanders and 
allow a fraud to perpetuate.  Reference can also be made to 
the rule in “Mst. Parveen (deceased) through LR.s and others 
v. Muhammad Pervaiz and others” (2022 SCMR 64) wherein 
it was held as follows: 

R.S.A. No.25 of 2015  
 
 
 
 
 
-8- 
 
 
 
“12. 
We may once again state that, that we are 
dismayed to observe the all too frequent practice 
in Pakistan of male heirs resorting to fraud and 
other tactics to deprive female heirs from their 
inheritance. 
While 
this 
deprivation 
causes 
suffering to those deprived, it also unnecessarily 
taxes the judicial system of the country, resulting 
in a needless waste of resources. Each and every 
day that a male heir deprives a female heir is also 
an abomination because it contravenes what has 
been ordained by Almighty Allah” 
12. 
Considering the rule supra, evidence on record and the 
reasoning recorded by the courts below, it is observed that the 
findings under challenge are unexceptionable whereby it was 
concluded that no gift by Noor Ahmad in favour of 
Muhammad Nawaz during his lifetime could be proved and 
that respondent No.4, the alleged attorney, could not prove the 
execution of power of attorney by the deceased or existence of 
any authority therein of making gift of property of Noor 
Ahmad, the mutation No.4467 dated 09.8.1993 of gift (in 
favour of Muhammad Nawaz predecessor of appellants) as 
also the subsequent mutation No.4470 dated 16.8.1993 (in 
favour of appellant Nos. 1 and 2) were illegal, a result of 
fraud, ab initio void, ineffective in law and that the property 
devolved upon the legal heirs of deceased Noor Ahmad on the 
opening of succession in accordance with their Islamic shares. 
13. 
As regards the objection of limitation the respondents 
claimed knowledge of the mutation of gift a few months 
before the filing of suit and after obtaining certified copies of 
the documents,  promptly filed the suit which was rightly held 
to be within time. In Faqir Ali’s case supra the gift mutation 
was attested in the year 1985 onwards and the suit for 
cancellation was instituted in year 2004.  It was observed to 
by the Supreme Court Of Pakistan to the effect that gift 
mutation having been challenged on grounds of fraud and 
collusion, the contention that suit was barred by time did not 

R.S.A. No.25 of 2015  
 
 
 
 
 
-9- 
 
 
 
have any force, as where fraud and collusion are alleged and 
established question of limitation cannot help the beneficiary 
thereof.  
14. 
In the instant case as noted supra D.W.1 could not deny 
that Noor Ahmad used to cultivate the land himself as also 
through others during his lifetime which proved beyond doubt 
that possession was not transferred and that the deceased 
continued to enjoy the status of owner till his death whereafter 
the property devolved upon his legal heirs in accordance with 
the Islamic Law. As per statement of P.W.1, the 
plaintiffs/respondents came to know about the fraudulent gift 
when they approached the patwari for getting copy of fard to 
sell their share and that the copy was supplied in November 
2004 whereafter they filed the suit in January 2005. There is 
no evidence in rebuttal to prove that either deceased had 
knowledge of the transaction or his legal heirs had any such 
clue and, therefore, the suit from the date of knowledge was 
rightly adjudged to be within time in view of the rule given in 
precedent supra. 
15. 
For the reasons hereinabove this appeal is devoid of 
substance which is, accordingly, dismissed.
