ASIM HAFEEZ, J.  These and connected constitutional petitions 
inter alia raise common issues and overlapping questions of law, 
wherein one set of petitions challenge the validity and imposition of 
Capital Value Tax (‘CVT’), enforced through section 6 of the Punjab 
Finance Act 2012 (Act, 2012) and demanded at the time of registration 
of instruments of lease of immovable properties falling within the limits 
of Gujranwala Cantonment.  
  
 
  
Second set of petitions questioned demand raised for payment of 
deficient stamp duty(ies) on the instruments of lease of immovable 
property. Stamp duty is allegedly calculated upon instruments of lease 
by classifying them as conveyance deeds. It is the case of the department 
that instruments of lease, extending leases over immovable property for 
twenty years and more, are subject to duty computable under Article 23 
of the Schedule I to the Stamp Act 1899, applicable for the province of 
Punjab, (‘Act, 1899’). And conversely, petitioners claimed that 
instruments of lease, notwithstanding creating lease in perpetuity, are 
liable to be charged for stamp duty under Article 35 of Act, 1899 - in 
some cases requests for registration of instruments of lease were denied 
on the premise that stamp duty is chargeable under Article 23 and not in 
terms of Article 35 of the Act, 1899.  
  
 
  
And third set of petitions, few in numbers, simultaneously 
question validity of Capital Value Tax and alleged demand for payment 
of deficient stamp duty on the instruments of lease. It is pertinent to 
mention that leases under reference were executed at the behest of the 
President of Pakistan, through Military Estate Officer(s). All these 

W.P. No.229002/2018.

petitions were heard and are decided through single order, though 
classified under separate headings, details whereof are listed in 
Annexure-A, and same shall be construed as part of the decision. 
  
A- DISCUSSION AND DETERMINATION OF FIRST SET 
OF PETITIONS – challenging vires of CVT.  
 
2. 
Learned counsels for petitioners, with respect to their respective 
petitions, pleaded that no CVT could be claimed against instruments of 
lease, which does not create or transfer ownership qua land. Adds that 
CVT is payable only upon transactions where property is conveyed or 
transferred and quantum thereof is determinable as per the declaration of 
value made by the transferee, which element of declaration is missing, 
since immovable properties are not transferred but leased out, 
irrespective of the duration of period of lease. Various clauses of section 
6 of Act, 2012 were read, including the definition of expression 
‘recorded value’. Learned counsels elaborated the concept of lease as 
explained under the Transfer of Property Act 1882, to distinguish the 
transaction encapsulated in the instruments of lease.   
 
3.  
Learned law officer defended the levy of CVT and insisted that 
transaction of lease is taxable accordingly. 
 
4. 
Controversy is simple, whether transactions, contained in the 
instruments of lease and rights created thereunder, are taxable under 
section 6 of the Act, 2012. It is expedient to reproduce relevant clauses 
of Section 6 of Act 2012 to understand the context, scope and 
applicability of levy qua instruments of lease, which clause reads as,  
 
“6. Capital value tax on immovable property. – (1) This section shall have effect 
notwithstanding anything contained in any other law.

5. 
Sub-section (3) of section 6 of the Act, 2012, being the charging 
section, imposes tax on the capital value of the immovable property either 
upon acquisition of the property, transacted by means of any of the modes, 

W.P. No.229002/2018. 
7
inter alia specified therein, or acquires a ‘right to use thereof for twenty 
years or more or renewal of lease so that the total period of lease 
in favour of the same lessee is twenty years or more at the rates 
specified in sub-section (5). Petitioners, those who claimed right to use 
of immovable property, for the period covered under the provision of 
law, by virtue of instruments of lease, squarely fall within the net of the 
levy. It is not denied that right to use the property had been acquired 
through Instruments of lease. It is an absurdity to absolve / exempt 
lessee(s), who had acquired a right to use the property, from payment of 
levy merely because no recorded value of the property was declared in 
the instruments or in absence of alleged declaration of recorded value. 
Assume a situation where value of the property or consideration amount 
is not mentioned in the instrument, through which property is acquired, 
by any one of the modes, or for that matter, right to use is acquired, or 
where the instrument is under-valued, whether CVT could not levied. 
This argument is fallacious. Expression ‘recorded value’ is defined 
under clause 2(g) of section 6 of the Act, 2012, which caters a situation 
where recorded value is less than the value of the property specified in 
the valuation table notified by the collector of the district. Same analogy 
is applicable in cases where the instruments contained no recorded value 
or quantum of consideration. Any other construction would be construed 
as extending premium vis-à-vis instruments, wherein recorded value or 
consideration amount is missing, which interpretation tantamount to 
playing fraud on the Statute – acquisition of immovable property by way 
of gift or exchange or power of attorney are modes where, 
conspicuously, necessity of recording value or mentioning of 
consideration is not hard pressed, could these transactions then be 
excluded from the levy of CVT. Answer is no. 
6. 
In view of the above, Instruments of lease, coming within the 
ambit of clause 3 of section 6 of Act, 2012, are subject to CVT levy and 
no instance of invalidity of levy is found. Petitions, where challenge is 
thrown to question the vires of CVT, are found meritless and same are 
dismissed.            

W.P. No.229002/2018.

B- DISCUSSION AND DETERMINATION OF SECOND SET OF 
PETITIONS – ascertainment of the character of the instrument for the 
purposes of determining the quantum of stamp duty.  
 
7. 
With reference to second set of petitions, it is argued that 
instruments of lease extend right to possess and use immovable property 
but not the full ownership therein. Learned counsel submits that 
instruments of lease contained various conditions / clauses, which entitle 
lessor to terminate the lease and repossess the land, which features of the 
instruments distinguish them from the class of documents, classified as 
conveyance deed(s), wherein, through latter documents, full ownership 
is conferred on the beneficiary thereof. Adds that Federal Government is 
the owner-cum-lessor of the property and entitled to invoke and exercise 
terms and conditions contained in the Instruments. It is emphasized that 
transaction of transfer of immovable property and transaction of lease 
were acknowledged and recognized as separate and distinguishable 
transactions, where former is classified as conveyance and fall under 
Article 23 of Schedule I, and latter come within the scope of Article 35 
of Schedule I to the Act, 1899. It is argued that Article 35 extends and 
covers transactions termed as lease(s) in perpetuity and dragging such 
transactions within the ambit of Article 23 is offensive to the legislative 
intent and against cannons of interpretation. Some petitioners have paid 
stamp duties at the time of execution of instruments of lease, subjected 
to duty in terms of Article 35 of Schedule I and lately demand was raised 
for payment of differential amount – after computing stamp duty under 
Article 23 of Schedule I to the Act, 1899. And in some of the petitions, 
the grievance raised is that instruments are not registered unless stamp 
duty, as claimed under Article 23 of Schedule I to the Act, 1899, is paid. 
And quantum of duties claimed is disputed. In some petitions ancillary 
issues are raised to object to the rate of Stamp duties payable, where rate 
of such duty varies in the context of the nature of the charges payable 
under the Instruments, in some cases rentals are claimed and in  

W.P. No.229002/2018. 
9
others premium is claimed. This Court is not dealing with individual 
objections regarding determination of rate of stamp duty payable in the 
context of peculiar terms and conditions regarding each Instrument of 
lease, which objections can be agitated before the Collector. Controversy 
hinges around the scope of Article 23 and 35 of Schedule I in the context 
of instruments of leases. 
8. 
Learned Law Officer argued that instruments of lease are 
classifiable as lease(s) in perpetuity, which, by fiction of law, constitute 
and extend ownership over the land. Adds that lease(s) are renewable 
upon payment of nominal rent / premium, which features bring them 
within the scope of transaction of conveyance, akin to conveyance 
deed(s), hence, Article 23 and not Article 35 of Schedule 1 to the Act, 
1899, is attracted. 
 
9. 
When confronted that whether absolute ownership rights qua 
properties, in favour of the lessee(s), are acknowledged, learned Law 
Officer sought time for seeking instructions. On 21.12.2023, learned 
Law Officer, accompanied with the representative of the department, 
tenaciously defended the orders passed by District Collector, treating 
instruments of lease as conveyance deeds and subjected to duties under 
Article 23 of Schedule-1 to Act, 1899.  
 
10. 
Argument is misconceived. When confronted with the text of 
Article 35 of Schedule-I to the Act, 1899, learned Law Officer could not 
dispute the fact that instruments of lease, including lease(s) in perpetuity, 
are identified therein and acknowledged as distinctive class of 
instrument(s), covered under Article 35, ibid.  
 
  
Submissions, that section 6 of the Act, 1899 is relevant and 
attracted, are misconceived and manifest erroneous reading of the text. 
When an instrument falls within a specific class of instruments, which 
are though separately identified in the Schedule I, then unless there is 
anything contrary thereto, resort to the section 6 of Act, 1899 cannot be 
made. In fact, section 6, in such eventuality, has no application.  

W.P. No.229002/2018. 
10
11. 
Emphasis by learned Law Officer that instruments of lease(s), 
wherein right to use the property was granted in perpetuity are covered 
under Article 23, is, apparently, misplaced, and otherwise contrary to the 
intent of the legislature. Sub-section 10 of section 2 of the Act, 1899, 
upon reading, displaced the argument of learned law officer, firstly on 
the ground that instrument of lease cannot be construed as document by 
which property is transferred and secondly, instrument of lease is 
covered under Article 35 of Schedule-I to the Act, 1899, therefore, no 
residuary effect can be extended to the instruments of lease. It is 
expedient to reproduce sub-section 10 of section 2 of the Act, 1899, 
which reads as,  
(10) “Conveyance” includes a conveyance on sale and every 
instrument by which property, whether movable or immovable, is 
transferred inter vivos and which is not otherwise specifically 
provided for by Schedule I.   
 
      
  
 
 
 
 
 
      [Emphasis supplied] 
 
12. 
Learned Law Officer submits that even otherwise different 
categories of lease(s), including lease in perpetuity, are identified in 
Article 35, and determination of quantum of stamp duty, in each case 
requires appreciation of terms and conditions contained in each of the 
instruments, who proposed that matter be referred to District Collector of 
the District for doing the needful – determination of quantum of stamp 
duty payable on each individual instrument. Request is opposed by 
learned counsel for the petitioners, who explained that said officer had 
already expressed mind and reference of the matter for redetermination 
would be an exercise in futility.  
  
 
  
On asking, it is apprised that a Member Board of Revenue is the 
authority, which is permitted to hear objections against the determination 
by the District Collector and if these matters are referred to the Member 
Board of Revenue for examination of the terms of instruments of lease, 
including the question that whether any of the instruments of lease 
manifest an attribute of transfer of conveyance or not, and determination 
of the quantum of stamp duty payable on each of said Instrument. 

W.P. No.229002/2018. 
11
13. 
Suggestion is tenable. Chief Revenue Authority, which is defined 
under section 2(8) of Act, 1899 as the Senior Member Board of 
Revenue, possess the jurisdiction and power to examine and express 
opinion qua the Instrument, in terms of Section 56 of Act, 1899. And in 
terms of section 57 of Act, 1899, Chief Revenue Authority is otherwise 
competent to state a case for the opinion of this Court. It is opt to resort 
to statutory mechanism provided in the law and not to express opinion 
with respect to the chargeability of Instruments, for the purposes of 
Stamp duty, and to refer matter to the Chief Revenue Authority. It is 
clarified that treatment extended, status conferred, or rights assigned 
through instruments of lease under other statutes are not subject matter 
of controversy. To avoid complication, it is appropriate to contextualize 
the controversy and define the scope of question referred for 
determination to the Chief Revenue Authority. For facility question 
referred is framed hereunder, 
 
“What amount of stamp duty is payable against subject 
matter instruments of lease under Article 35 of Schedule-1 
to the Act, 1899 and whether any such instrument of lease 
could be brought within the scope of Article 23 of 
Schedule-I to the Act, 1899 and if so, what are those 
distinguishing conditions embodied in the instrument(s)”.   
 
14. 
In view of the aforesaid, all constitutional petitions, wherein 
questions of determination of quantum of Stamp duty are raised, are 
referred to the Chief Revenue Authority for determination of the 
question of law proposed, which shall examine each instrument of lease, 
subject matter of constitutional petitions, and express opinion regarding 
the stamp duty chargeable on the Instruments of lease. It is expected that 
requisite exercise would be completed within period of four (4) months 
from the date of receipt of copy of this order. Quantum of Stamp Duty 
determined by the Chief Revenue Authority, with respect to each 
Instrument examined, shall be the liability of the petitioners and amount 
determined would be payable accordingly.  
 

W.P. No.229002/2018. 
12
15. 
In some cases, it has been apprised that registration of the 
instruments of lease was delayed due to the controversy regarding proper 
classification of the Instruments for the purposes of determining 
applicability of relevant Article of Schedule I to the Act, 1899. It is 
directed that all such instruments of lease, awaiting registration, shall be 
registered conditionally in terms of Article 35 of Schedule I to the Act, 
1899, upon procuring written undertaking from the lessee(s), containing 
unconditional and irrevocable consent to pay the differential amount, if 
found payable after determination of the question framed by the Chief 
Revenue Authority. It is observed that differential amount, if any 
determined, by the Chief Revenue Authority, with respect to Instruments 
already registered and instruments conditionally registered, in terms of 
this order, shall be treated as encumbrance / charge over right to use and 
liability is recoverable as amount due. 
16. 
With reference to third categories of the petitions, it is decided 
that challenge thrown to the extent of imposition of CVT levy is 
dismissed, in terms of the reasoning extended in paragraphs 5 and 6 of 
this judgment, and with respect to the relief sought in the context of 
determination of the amount of stamp duty payable against instruments 
of lease stood decided in terms of preceding paragraphs. 
17. 
Petitions are decided accordingly in aforesaid terms. No orders as 
to the costs.
