Iqbal Hussain etc.  
Versus 
Govt. of the Punjab etc.  
 
Date of Hearing: 19.03.2024 
 
Appellants by:

Respondents by: 
Mr. Tahrim Iqbal Butt, Assistant Advocate 
General, Govt. of the Punjab.  
 
*********************  
 
MASUD ABID NAQVI, J. Brief 
facts 
necessary 
for 
the 
adjudication of this appeal are that the respondents No.1 & 2 
acquired a land measuring 28 Kanal 2 Marla owned by the 
appellants for construction of second new Ravi Bridge commonly 
known as Saggian Ravi Bridge, Lahore by issuing notifications 
under Land Acquisition Act, 1984 in years 1993-1994. 
Thereafter, Award was announced by assessing the value of land 
of appellants which was/is situated in the river-bed @ Rs.1062 
per Marla. Reference Petition was instituted by the appellants and 
keeping in view the pleadings of the parties, the issues were 
framed by learned referee court and thereafter  parties produced 
their respective oral & documentary evidence in support of their 
respective contentions and learned referee court vide judgment 

       RFA No. 10887-2021

dated 18.12.2020 dismissed the reference petition and upheld the 
award dated 19.08.2004. Feeling aggrieved by the judgment dated 
18.12.2020, the appellants filed instant regular first appeal. 
2.  
It has been contended on behalf of the appellants that 
the acquired land has been under-valued by the respondents and 
the price of the adjacent lands is much more than the 
compensation assessed. The value of the acquired land is not less 
than Rs.65,000/- per marla. In support of their contentions, the 
appellants produced Sameer Ashfaq/PW-1, Muhammad Abu 
Bakar Malik/PW-2 and Ch. Muhammad Yaqoob/PW-3 and 
exhibited copy of inheritance mutation No.6406/Ex.P-2, attested 
copy of Fard Malkiat/Ex.P-3 & copies of RFA & Order as Ex.P-4 
& Ex.P-5. Conversely, it has been argued on behalf of the 
respondents by the Learned Assistant Advocate General that 
before announcing the award, proper procedure was followed and 
correctly assessed the value of appellants’ acquired land by the 
authorities which is admittedly situated in river bed and was not 
under the use & even same was not actually occupied by the 
appellants and none of other persons challenged the acquisition 
proceedings whose land(s) were also acquired. In support of their 
contentions, 
the 
respondents 
produced

Collector 
Officer/DW-1.

3.  
We have heard the arguments of learned counsels for 
the parties and minutely gone through the record as well as the 
judgment passed by the learned referee court. 
4.  
Onus to prove issue No. 2 & 3 lies on the appellants and 
in order to prove that the assessment of compensation of acquired 
land is grossly inadequate by ignoring the potential value of land 
and the appellants are entitled for enhanced compensation, the 
appellants produced Sameer Ashfaq/PW-1, Muhammad Abu 
Bakar Malik/PW-2 and Ch. Muhammad Yaqoob/PW-3. While 
appearing on behalf of appellants, the PWs admitted in their 
respective cross-examination that land of the appellants is river 
land and adjacent land(s) were also acquired from different 
persons by the authority but intentionally withheld the 
information about initiation of any litigation by those persons 
against acquisition of their land(s) and simply denied any 
knowledge about the litigation. Appellants were under legal 
obligation to prove their claim of inadequate assessment of 
acquired land and potential value of land through corroborative 
and unimpeachable oral and documentary evidence but neither of 
them deposed in their examination in chief any contemporary sale 
transaction of adjacent land nor exhibited any documentary 
evidence i.e. sale deed or sale mutation. There is no documentary 
proof/revenue record about the cultivation of acquired land or 

       RFA No. 10887-2021

value of adjacent land(s) situated in river-bed pertaining to years 
1993-1994. 
Hence, 
the 
appellants 
miserably 
failed 
to 
prove/substantiate their claim and mere claim of owners/appellant 
without supportive evidence would be inconsequential. In a 
judgment reported as ‘Jind wadda & others v. General Manager 
NHA (LM & IS), Islamabad and others” (2023 SCMR 1005) the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan observed that: - 
"The 
appellants 
have 
failed 
to 
produce 
any 
independent, trustworthy and credible evidence for their 
claim qua enhancement of the compensation. The 
burden of proof in such cases is 'incumbent' upon land-
owners [see Land Acquisition Collector v. Muhammad 
Sultan (PLD 2014 SC 696)]. 
 
5.  
All the PWs had no personal knowledge about the 
proceedings of acquisition of land and just deposed hearsay 
evidence or expressed their personal opinion which has minimal 
value until and unless same has been corroborated with other 
documentary evidence. Under Article 71 of Qanun-e-Shahadat 
Order, 1984, it is basic requirement that the oral evidence must, 
in all cases whatsoever, be direct. The use of word "must" in the 
Article imposes a duty on the Court to exclude all Oral evidence 
which is not "direct" and hearsay evidence is not admissible 
subject to certain exceptions provided in Articles 46 & 64 Qanun-
e-Shahadat Order, 1984. Reliance is placed on judgment reported 
as “Abdul Qayyum v. Muhammad Sadiq” (2007 SCMR 957). 

       RFA No. 10887-2021

6.  
There is no cavil to the proposition that if a person 
asserts his legal rights or liability depending upon the existence of 
certain facts, he has to prove those facts and to discharge the 
burden of proof under Article 117 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 
1984. In view of the meaning of “onus probandi”, if no evidence 
is produced by a person on whom the burden lies then such issue 
must be decided against him. The appellants were legally bound 
to produce tangible evidence in support of their plea of 
enhancement and they not only failed to discharge their burden 
but the appellants also badly failed to substantiate their point of 
view through any authentic, oral as well as documentary evidence 
and the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in a judgment 
reported as “Hyderabad Development through M.D Civic center 
Hyderabad Vs Abdul Majeed and others” (PLD 2002 SC 84) held 
that: - 
"However, during hearing of Reference under section 
18 of the Act, judicial proceedings are conducted, 
therefore, party interested in enhancement of the 
compensation owes a duty to discharge the burden by 
producing convincing evidence." (Land Acquisition 
Collector v. Muhammad Sultan (PLD 2014 SC 696). 
 
7. 
 From the above detailed discussion, it is quite obvious 
that learned referee court has thoroughly appreciated the material 
evidence placed on record while deciding the reference, keeping 
in view the price of adjacent land, market value of the land 

       RFA No. 10887-2021

acquired, its future potential value and prospective use of the 
land. Neither any misreading or non-reading of evidence by 
learned referee court has been pointed out, therefore, no 
interference is needed to be made in the impugned reference, 
which is in accordance with law, accordingly, this appeal is 
dismissed being devoid of any merit.

applicants/appellants. 
Mr. Tahrim Iqbal Butt, Assistant Advocate 
General, Govt. of the Punjab.  
 
C.M.No.1-C-2022 
 
The appellants/applicants have filed instant 
application for production of additional evidence. 
2. 
Order 41 Rule 27 of CPC deals with 
production of additional evidence in appellate 
court which is reproduced hereunder for better 
understanding: 
“Rule 27.  Production of additional 
evidence in Appellate Court.---(1) The 
parties to an appeal shall not be entitled to 
produce additional evidence, whether oral 
or documentary in the Appellate Court. But 
if-- 
(a) the Court from whose decree the appeal 
is preferred has refused to admit evidence 
which out to have been admitted, or 
(b) the Appellate Court requires any 
document to be produced or any witness to 
be examined to enable it to pronounce 

RFA No.10887 of 2021 
2 
 
 
 
 
judgment, or for any other substantial 
cause, the Appellate Court may allow such 
evidence or document to be produced, or 
witness to be examined. 
(2) Wherever additional evidence is 
allowed to be produced by an Appellate 
Court, the Court shall record the reason 
for its admission.”  
 
From the perusal of above provisions of 
law it is quite clear that additional evidence can 
be allowed only where the trial court has 
improperly refused to admit the evidence which 
ought to have been admitted or the appellate court 
requires such document or witness and cannot 
pronounce judgment without such additional 
evidence or the appellate court requires such 
evidence for any other substantial cause. While 
discussing the power under Order 41 Rule 27 of 
CPC, the August Supreme Court of Pakistan in a 
case reported as Rana Abdul Aleem Khan Vs 
Idara National Industrial Co-operative Finance 
Corporation defunct through Chairman Punjab 
Co-operative Board for Liquidation, Lahore and 
another (2016 SCMR 2067) held as under: 
“the power under the provisions of Order 
XLI, Rule 27 of the C.P.C. for allowing 
additional evidence available is not 
unfettered nor does the Appellate Court 

RFA No.10887 of 2021 
3 
 
 
 
 
has the discretion to allow additional 
evidence per its own caprice, rather it 
(discretion) is structured/limited by the 
factors enunciated in the said provision of 
law i.e. where the court from whose decree 
the appeal has been preferred has refused 
to admit any evidence which is ought to 
have admit.” 
 
3. 
The suit was filed on 23.07.2005 and the 
same was decided on 18.12.2020. The applicants/ 
appellants have filed instant application seeking 
permission to place on file the notification of 
2004 as additional evidence. The request made by 
the applicants is without disclosing any valid 
reasons or sufficient cause for seeking production 
of additional evidence at this stage. The case of 
the applicants/appellants does not fall within the 
mischief of Rule 27 ibid, hence, this application 
is dismissed.  This order be made part of the 
judgment of even date passed by this Court in 
main R.F.A.No.10887 of 2021.
