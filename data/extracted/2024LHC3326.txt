Advisor Food Authority. 
Ms. Asmat Parveen, Deputy District Public Prosecutor. 
 
 
 Through this petition under Section 497 Cr.P.C., petitioners 
seek bail after arrest in case FIR No. 1320 dated 16.05.2024 
registered at Police Station Thekriwala, District Faisalabad for 
non bailable offences under sections 22-A (punishable up to five years’ 
imprisonment) & 24 (in this case 6 months’ imprisonment) of the Punjab Food 
Authority Act, 2011.  
 
2. 
 As per prosecution story, on 16.05.2024 at about 03:00 
p.m., Food Safety team inspected a vehicle bearing registration 
No.8789-CAR and found 15 mounds/600 Kilograms meat which 
was checked by Veterinary Officer Livestock Dr. Robi Tabassum 
and declared it as unfit for human consumption; petitioners could 
not produce any record of sale & purchase of said meat nor any 
agreement or delivery challan in this respect during inspection; 
quantity of dead meat was suspected to be transported at different 
food points; resultantly was destroyed by the Food Safety team at 
the spot.  
 
3.      Learned counsel for the petitioners contends that allegations 
levelled against the petitioners are false because they have been 
dealing with supply of meat for the last about 15/20 years with no 
complaint whatsoever in this regard and on the day, they were 
also carrying fresh meat with verified stamp of Incharge 
slaughter house; further states that offences do not fall within the 
prohibitory clause of section 497 Cr.P.C., and bail in such like

              2 
 
offences is a rule. Learned counsel for the petitioners, however 
could not substantiate his arguments through any document on 
record.  
 
4.  Learned legal advisor for Punjab Food Authority opposed the 
bail with the submissions that the crime committed by the 
petitioners is not only inhuman but also against the society 
putting the lives of masses at stake. It is learnt that in routine 
such dead meat is reportedly used in restaurants, banquets, food 
kiosks and on renowned Shawarma points. Learned Deputy 
District Public Prosecutor has also opposed the bail on the 
ground that Destruction Form prepared by the food safety team 
was also handed over to the petitioners at the site leaving no 
chance of misstatement so as to provide a clue in favour of the 
petitioners that they were carrying healthy meat. Further stated 
that not falling in prohibitory clause does not provide premium to 
petitioners to seek bail in offences which are considered against 
the society. 
5.   Heard; record perused. 
6.   The material in the form of statements of veterinary doctor & 
food safety officers, vehicle carrying dead meat, Destruction 
Form, and non-provision of sale purchase record of said meat or 
agreement for delivery or transportation to a certain food point or 
certificate from a slaughter house, clearly indicate the criminal 
liability of the petitioners, not only under penal provisions of 
Punjab Food Authority Act, 2011 but under the provisions of the 
Punjab Animals Slaughter Control Act, 1963 (the Act). 
According to section 3(3) of the Act, a person shall not: 
 
(a) sell, keep, store, transport, supply, offer or expose for sale, 
or hawk any meat or carcass of a: 
 
(i) haram animal or of an animal which died of, or has 
suffered from contagious diseases or has been poisoned 
to death, or died because of gunshot wound or 
electrocution; 
 
(ii)  meat or carcass of any animal which has been 
slaughtered in contravention of this Act or does not bear 
the stamp, mark, tag or certification of the slaughter-
house specified by the concerned local authority;  
 

Crl. Misc. No. 38478-B of 2024 
 
 
 
 
 
              3 
 
Section-8 (2) of said Act prescribes the sentence of offence as 
under;  
 
“If a person contravenes any provision of clause (a) of 
subsection (3) of section 3, he shall be punished with 
imprisonment which may extend to eight years but which 
shall not be less than four years and with fine which may 
extend to five hundred thousand rupees but which shall not be 
less than three hundred thousand rupees.” 
 
                                                                   (Emphasis supplied) 
 
Under the Punjab Animals Slaughter Control Act, 1963, 
Courts are authorized to presume the commission of offences 
as reflected from following provision; 
 
3A.   Presumptions.- In every prosecution under this Act, the 
court shall presume that any: 
 
(a) meat or carcass found in possession of any person 
who is, or has been, habitually selling, keeping, 
storing, transporting, offering or exposing for sale, or 
hawking the meat or carcass, was being sold, kept, 
stored, transported, offered or exposed for sale or 
hawked by such person; 
 
(b) meat or carcass which does not bear the stamp, mark, 
tag or certification of a slaughter-house has been 
slaughtered in contravention of the Act. 
                            
Thus, if the allegations are not rebutted, the Court shall not 
wait for formal proof rather presume the commission of 
offence so as to punish the offenders.  
 
7.   It is trite that while dealing with bail petition Court can 
consider as to what offence is made out from facts and 
circumstance of the case. Reliance is placed on case reported 
as “MUHAMMAD WAQAS versus THE STATE” (2002 
SCMR 1370). Above offence under the Act is so serious that 
for its prevention government has proposed a reward for 
providing information about commission of such offence as 
reflected from following provision of the Act; 
“10. Reward to informers.– The court trying an offence 
under this Act may direct that an amount not exceeding 
seventy five percent of such sum as may be realized by way of 
fine or under section 517 of the Code, be awarded to the 
person or persons supplying information relating to the 
commission of the offence under the Act.”

8.  There are serious allegations against the petitioners and eye 
winking of such offence would open a gateway for such elements 
to play with the health of citizens. Some of the diseases afflicted 
due to consumption of such items last for years and even till 
death but on the other hand healthy meat is safer to eat, it 
enhances metabolism, tastes better, more hygienic and improves 
immune system, therefore, by all means, offences committed by 
the petitioners are against the society at large and a quantity of 15 
mounds/600 Kilograms dead meat cannot be planted to set up a 
fake case against the petitioners. 
 
9.   Though the offences do not fall within the prohibitory clause 
of section 497, Cr.P.C. but it is not the rule of thumb to grant bail 
to accused in offences not falling within such category as a 
matter of right if the case falls in exceptions like offence against 
society.  Reliance in this respect is placed on case reported as 
“MUHAMMAD SIDDIQUE versus IMTIAZ BEGUM and 2 
others” (2002 SCMR 442). Similar expressions are in cases 
reported as “RASHAD IMRAN Versus The STATE and another” 
(2022 SCMR 1304); “UMER KHAN Versus The STATE and 
another” (2022 SCMR 216); “ALLAH YAR and 4 others 
Versus The STATE and another” (2023 P Cr. L J Note 60): 
“IRFAN SARWAR Versus The STATE” (2022 P Cr. L J Note 
71). From the material evaluated tentatively, no ‘reasonable 
grounds’ as contemplated in section 497 (2) Cr.P.C., are 
available to extend concession of bail. Under such exceptional 
circumstances, the petitioners do not deserve to be released on 
bail. Hence, the titled petition is dismissed.
