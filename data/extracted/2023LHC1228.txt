Mr. Muhammad Ahsan Bhoon, Advocate, with Mr. Hafeez-
ur-Rehman Chaudhry, Advocate, for the Petitioner. 
 
Rao Zaigham Ali, Special Prosecutor for ANF, with Hakim 
Ali/SI. 
 
 
 
 
 
Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – By this application, the 
Petitioner seeks post-arrest in case FIR No.57/2022 dated 15.12.2022 
registered at Police Station ANF, Lahore, for offences under sections 
9(2)(Item 9), and 15 of Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997  
(XXV of 1997) (the “CNSA”). 
2. 
 
As per FIR, the prosecution case is that on 15.12.2022 the 
Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) received source information that the 
Petitioner (Liaquat Ali) and co-accused Syed Asad Abbas Naqvi traded 
in a contraband chemical and would transport it in Hyundai Tucson 
vehicle No. ALF-507 and Honda City car No.LEF-17-2695 to deliver it 
to their customers near Universal College, Raiwind Road, Lahore, 
around 8:15 p.m. Consequent thereupon, the authorities constituted a 
raiding party headed by the Complainant, Hakim Ali/SI, which managed 
to intercept the accused and recovered 10 kgs. of ketamine, a 
psychotropic substance, from each of them. 
3. 
 
In support of this application, Mr. Muhammad Ahsan 
Bhoon, Advocate, contends that the Petitioner is a partner in FYNK 
Pharmaceuticals (the “Firm”), which is engaged in the sale, purchase, 
distribution, manufacturing, import and export of various medicines 
under licence from the Government. He submits that ketamine is a 
dissociative anaesthetic used medically for induction and maintenance of 

Crl. Misc. No.7517/B/2023

anaesthesia. It is also used to treat depression and is a pain management 
tool. The Firm imported it for manufacturing injections for hospital use 
on 20.4.2021 in accordance with the law. The Ministry of Narcotics 
Control, Government of Pakistan, classified it and its salts as 
psychotropic substances for the purpose of the CNSA and placed them at 
Serial No. 39-A of the Schedule thereto vide notification dated 
15.10.2021. The said notification cannot be applied retrospectively to 
question the import of 20.4.2021. The Petitioner – and the transaction – 
are protected under Article 12 of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”). Mr. Bhoon further 
contends that the ANF officials seized ketamine from the Firm’s factory 
and not from the cars on Raiwind Road. The facts given in the FIR are 
false and concocted. 
4. 
 
The Special Prosecutor for ANF contends that the 
Government subjected ketamine and its salts to regulation and control 
vide SRO No. 446(I)/2020 dated 6.4.2020. Hence, the Petitioner’s 
import, if any, on 20.4.2021 was unlawful. He further contends that 
section 7 of the CNSA prohibits the transportation of psychotropic 
substances, even inside Pakistan, except in accordance with Control of 
Narcotic Substances (Regulation of Drugs of Abuse, Controlled 
Chemicals, Equipment and Materials) Rules, 2001. The Petitioner has 
violated section 7 as well and thus committed an offence under section 
9(2) of the CNSA. Besides, the Special Prosecutor claims that the 
Petitioner has contravened various other provisions of the aforesaid 
Rules, which constitutes a separate offence. 
5. 
 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
6. 
 
Nullum crimen sine lege (“no crime without law”) and nulla 
poena sine lege (“no punishment without law”) are the fundamental 
principles of criminal law. Tribe writes: 
“It is essential in a free and democratic society that citizens are able, 
as far as possible, to foresee the consequences of their conduct in 
order that persons be given fair notice of what to avoid, and that the 
discretion of those entrusted with law enforcement is limited by clear 
and explicit legislative standards.”1

The above principles feature in all human rights 
instruments.2 Article 11(2) of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights (1948) says: 
“No one shall be held guilty of any penal offence on account of any 
act or omission which did not constitute a penal offence, under 
national or international law, at the time when it was committed. Nor 
shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at 
the time the penal offence was committed.” 
Article 7(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights 
(ECHR) (1950) reproduces this text. Article 15(1) of the U.N. Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights (1966) also reproduces it with the following 
addition: 
“If, subsequent to the commission of the offence, provision is made 
by law for the imposition of a lighter penalty, the offender shall 
benefit thereby.” 
8. 
 
Article 9 of the American Convention on Human Rights 
provides: 
“No one shall be convicted of any act or omission that did not 
constitute a criminal offense, under the applicable law, at the time it 
was committed. A heavier penalty shall not be imposed than the one 
that was applicable at the time the criminal offense was committed. If 
subsequent to the commission of the offense, the law provides for the 
imposition of a lighter punishment, the guilty person shall benefit 
therefrom.” 
9. 
 
The Constitutions of almost all countries also contain a 
similar prohibition. Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution says, 
“No … ex post facto law shall be passed.”3 In Calder v. Bull, 
(1798) 3 U.S. 386, Chase J. of the U.S. Supreme Court explained that the 
expression ex post facto law means: 
i) 
Every law that makes an action done before the passing of the 
law and which was innocent when done, criminal and 
punishes such action.  
ii) 
Every law that aggravates a crime or makes it greater than it 
was when committed.  
iii) 
Every law that changes the punishment and inflicts a greater 
punishment than the law annexed to the crime when 
committed.

iv) 
Every law that alters the legal rules of evidence and receives 
less or different testimony than the law required at the time of 
the commission of the offense in order to convict the offender. 
10. 
 
Durga Das Basu, citing Cooley, adds the following two 
rules to the above:4 
i) 
Every law which, assuming to regulate civil rights and 
remedies only, in effect, imposes a penalty or the deprivation 
of a right for something which, when done, was lawful. 
ii) 
Every law which deprives persons accused of a crime of some 
lawful protection to which they have become entitled: such as 
the protection of a former conviction or acquittal, or the 
proclamation of amnesty, or takes away a defence. 
11. 
 
In England, there is no legal bar on Parliament’s capacity to 
make any law and give them a retrospective effect. Nevertheless, in 
Phillips v. Eyre, (1870) LR 6 Q.B. 1, the Court observed: “Retrospective 
laws are no doubt prima facie of questionable policy, and contrary to the 
general principle that legislation by which the conduct of mankind is to 
be regulated ought not to change the character of past transactions 
carried upon on faith of the then existing law.” In Waddington v. Miah, 
[1974] UKHL 6; [1974] 2 All ER 377,  Lord Reid said: “It is hardly 
credible that any Government department would promote or that 
Parliament would pass retrospective criminal legislation.” The Human 
Rights Act of 1998 secures the rights set out in the ECHR. It obligates 
public agencies (including the government, police, and local 
governments) to uphold these rights. As a result, the right mentioned in 
Article 7(1) of the ECHR (supra) is also protected under the aforesaid 
Act. 
12. 
 
In India, Article 20(1) of their Constitution limits the law-
making power of every legislative authority in the country as regards 
retrospective criminal legislation. In Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh and 
another v. The State of Vindhya Pradesh (AIR 1953 SC 394), the 
Supreme Court of India ruled that Article 20(1) prohibits conviction or 
sentence based on an ex post facto substantive law. However, nobody 
has a vested right in the procedure. As long as the substantive law 
remains unchanged, a trial can be held under a procedure that differs 
from what existed when the offence was committed. In Sukhdev Singh

v. State of Haryana (AIR 2013 SC 953), the Supreme Court held that 
the provisions of a penal statute should be strictly construed. They 
cannot be applied retrospectively unless the legislative intent and 
expression are absolutely clear. According to Basu, Article 20(1) of the 
Indian Constitution follows the American pattern but does not use the 
expression ex post facto laws.5 
13. 
 
In Pakistan, Article 12(1) of the Constitution of 1973 is 
relevant to our discussion. It reads: 
12. 
Protection against retrospective punishment.– (1) No law 
shall authorize the punishment of a person– 
(a) 
for an act or omission that was not punishable by law 
at the time of the act or omission; or 
(b) 
for an offence by a penalty greater than, or of a kind 
different from, the penalty prescribed by law for that 
offence at the time the offence was committed. 
14. 
 
In Nabi Ahmed and another v. Home Secretary, 
Government of West Pakistan, and others (PLD 1969 SC 599), the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan held that there is no fundamental difference 
between retrospective law and ex post facto law. The former is used in 
civil and the latter in criminal matters, which are more serious by 
definition. Speaking for the Court, Qadeeruddin Ahmad J. stated that one 
of the reasons for the rule against ex post facto law is that law abiding-
citizens regulate their lives according to the law as it existed at the time 
of their actions. They expect the law to remain consistent and reliable. 
People examine and consider the implications in light of the demands of 
the law, including the requirements implied in the current legal system, 
and feel duped if the law later lets them down by taking away or 
reducing their rights or enhancing their obligations. 
15. 
 
According to Justice Fazal Karim, Article 12 is concerned 
with “punishment”. It is not as broad as the ex post facto clause in the 
American 
Constitution, 
which 
encompasses 
even 
procedural 
amendments, such as rules of evidence. Article 12 guarantees protection 
with reference to the time of the act or omission which may 
subsequently be made punishable and to the commission of an offence 
for which a heavier or a different kind of penalty may be imposed by 
                                                 
5 ibid, p. 4500. 

Crl. Misc. No.7517/B/2023

legislation that takes effect from a previous date. The time of the 
commencement of a proceeding to impose the punishment is not critical 
to the protection. This distinction is important. As a result, while every 
law that alters the legal rules of evidence or any other procedural rule is 
prohibited by the American ex post facto clause, it is not barred by 
Article 12 of our Constitution.6 
16. 
 
In The Income Tax Officer (Investigation) Circle I, Dacca 
and another v. Sulaiman Bhai Jiwar (PLD 1970 SC 80), the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan held that no statute should be construed to have a 
retrospective operation unless such a construction appeared very clearly 
or through the necessary implication from the Act itself. In Abdul 
Rehman v. The State (1978 SCMR 292), the sentence of transportation 
for life was calculated as 20 years when the offence was committed. The 
Supreme Court ruled that the sentence of life imprisonment could not be 
subsequently substituted for it because that meant a prison term of 25 
years. In Dr. Muhammad Safdar v. Edward Henry Louis  
(PLD 2009 SC 404), the parties to the dispute had instituted civil suits 
regarding the property. The matter was sub judice long before the Illegal 
Dispossession Act of 2005 came into force. The Supreme Court held that 
the 2005 Act could not be applied retrospectively. In Khizar Hayat v. 
The State (2012 SCMR 1066), the offence under section 324 PPC 
carried a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment and a fine at the 
time of occurrence. Later, on 25.10.1994, the Criminal Law  
(Third Amendment) Ordinance, 1994 amended section 324 PPC and 
provided that a person committing the said offence would be punished 
not only for his intention to commit Qatl-e-Amd but also for the injury 
caused by him with that intention. Since the occurrence in the case 
before the Supreme Court had taken place long before that amendment, 
it ruled that the appellant’s sentence could not be enhanced 
retrospectively because of Article 12(1)(b) of the Constitution. 
17. 
 
Let’s now turn to the case at hand. The CNSA consolidates 
and amends the law relating to narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances, 
and controlled substances. It inter alia aims to control their production,

processing and trafficking and implement the provisions of the 
international conventions in this regard. Section 2 of the CNSA defines 
the aforesaid terms which are supplemented by the Schedule thereto.7 
Section 2(za) empowers the Federal Government to declare any 
substance to be a psychotropic substance by notification in the official 
Gazette.8 Under section 7(2), it can make rules to permit and regulate the 
import, export, and transhipment of narcotic drugs, psychotropic or 
controlled substances through a licence or permit. 
18. 
 
The Petitioner claims that the Firm manufactures ketamine 
HCl 50 mg/ml ampules under its brand name Ketajin Injection. On 
15.11.2019, it submitted a letter to the Drug Regulatory Authority of 
Pakistan (DRAP) inquiring about the status of ketamine HCl in the 
country. On 7.1.2020, DRAP responded to that letter, stating that 
ketamine HCl was not included in any Schedule of the CNSA and thus 
did not require specific import authorization. However, it enjoined the 
Firm to comply with all the formalities prescribed by law, including 
obtaining a clearance certificate from the Assistant Director (I & E) 
concerned as specified under the Drugs (Import & Export) Rules, 1976, 
before customs clearance. On 23.9.2020, the Firm applied to DRAP to 
renew its product registration in Form 5B and then placed an order for 
1000 kgs. of ketamine hydrochloride B.P. with Smart Solutions Gmbh, 
Germany. On 16.4.2021, the shipment arrived in Pakistan and was 
cleared. 
19. 
 
The Federal Government, exercising the powers conferred 
under section 2(za) of the CNSA, declared ketamine hydrochloride a 
psychotropic substance by inserting it at Serial No. 39-A in the Schedule 
to the CNSA vide SRO No. 446(I)/2020 dated 6.4.2020. However, it 
withdrew that SRO ab initio vide Letter No.  13-20/2014-Policy-1 dated 
21.8.2020 (see the Appendix). Subsequently, by SRO 1350(I)/2021 
dated 15.10.2021, the Federal Government again declared that ketamine 
                                                 
7 Control of Narcotics Substances (Amendment) Act, 2002 (XX of 2022) has introduced various amendments in the 
CNSA (Act XXV of 1997) which are not relevant for the decision of the present case. However, there is no material 
change in the law on this point. The original “Schedule” has been re-designated as “Schedule-I” by amending clause 
(za) of section 2 of the CNSA (Act XXV of 1997). 
8 Control of Narcotics Substances (Amendment) Act, 2002, has also inserted new section 74 in Act XXV of 1997 which 
authorizes the Federal Government to amend the Schedules, by notification in the official Gazette, and add, amend or 
omit any entry therefrom.

and its salts would be a psychotropic substance for the purpose of the 
CNSA by placing it at Serial No. 39-A in the Schedule thereof. 
20. 
 
On 16.4.2021, when the Petitioner’s shipment landed in 
Pakistan, its import was prohibited under the CNSA. However, it cannot 
be sanctioned due to Letter No. 13-20/2014-Policy-1 dated 21.8.2020. In 
light of the law and jurisprudence outlined above, SRO 1350(I)/2021 
dated 15.10.2021 also cannot be applied retrospectively to punish the 
Petitioner. Article 12(1) of the Constitution protects him. 
21. 
 
Section 7 of the CNSA prohibits the transportation of any 
narcotic drug, psychotropic substance or controlled substance except 
when it is in conformity with the rules made under section 7(2) and is in 
accordance with the conditions of any permit, licence or authorization 
required to be obtained under those rules. Any contravention of section 7 
is an offence under section 9. The Federal Government has, vide SRO 
808(I)/2001 dated 28.11.2001, published those rules which are known as 
Control of Narcotic Substances (Regulation of Drugs of Abuse, 
Controlled Chemicals, Equipment and Material) Rules 2001 (hereinafter 
referred to as the “Rules”). Although SRO 1350(I)/2021 is not 
retrospective, the Petitioner was required to comply with the Rules from 
their enforcement date, i.e. 15.10.2021. It was necessary for him to 
obtain a valid permit or authorization under the Rules for the 
transportation of ketamine within Pakistan. In Messrs Ghani Herbal 
Pharma Laboratories v. Secretary and others (PLD 2005 Lahore 93), 
the appellant manufactured and sold Unani medicines under licence 
under the Dangerous Drugs Rules, 1958, in Form DD-5. He was allowed 
to acquire and hold 9 kgs. of medicinal opium quarterly. The authorities 
released him half of the sanctioned quota but refused the rest due to 
stock depletion. The appellant filed a constitutional petition in this Court 
seeking a writ of mandamus. Meanwhile, the CNSA was enacted, and 
the Dangerous Drugs Rules of 1958 were repealed. A Division Bench of 
this Court held that the appellant was required to get a licence under the 
Narcotic Substances (Regulation of Drugs of Abuse, Controlled 
Chemicals, Equipment and Materials) Rules, 2001, for further issuance 

Crl. Misc. No.7517/B/2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9 
 
of any medicinal opium. He could not ask for the release of the 
remaining quantity against the previous licence.  
22. 
 
PWs Abdul Samad Khan/ASI, Abdul Shakoor Shahid/Head 
Constable, Shafqat Javed/Constable, and Ishfaq Hussain/Constable have 
got their statements recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C. in support of the 
prosecution case that the ANF seized ketamine from the Petitioner at 
Raiwind Road. He has not produced any permit for such transportation 
to date. Prima facie, he has committed an offence under section 7 of the 
CNSA read with section 9 thereof. His defence plea that the ANF seized 
the aforementioned chemical from his factory would be considered at the 
trial. 
23. 
 
The Petitioner is also obligated to maintain the consumption 
record of ketamine under the Rules. Prima facie, he has defaulted on that 
account as well and rendered himself liable under section 16 of the 
CNSA. In this context, it would be advantageous to refer to Khan 
Asfand Yar Wali and others v. Federation of Pakistan and others 
(PLD 2001 SC 607). Section 5(r) of the National Accountability Bureau 
Ordinance, 1999, stipulated that a person commits the offence of “willful 
default” if he does not pay, or continues not to pay, or return or repay … 
on the date that it became due … and a period of thirty days has expired 
thereafter. The appellant contended that “willful default” was not an 
offence punishable by law when he allegedly committed it. The Supreme 
Court held that section 5(r) envisages a continuing breach of duty to pay 
the loan. It contemplates default which is not committed once but is 
continuous. Thus, on every occasion the default occurs and recurs, it 
constitutes a new act and would attract section 5(r). In this sense, this 
provision is prospective and not retrospective. 
24. 
 
In view of the above, this application is dismissed.
