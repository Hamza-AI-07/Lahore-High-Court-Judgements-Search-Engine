RAHEEL KAMRAN, J. – In this reference application under 
Section 133(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 („Ordinance‟), the 
following question of law has been proposed for our opinion which is 
asserted to have arisen from the order dated 17.05.2022 passed by the 
Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue, Lahore („Tribunal‟) in ITA 
No.4094/LB of 2021:- 
“Whether general condonation of limitation 
under Section 214A of Income Tax Ordinance, 
2001, Section 74 of Sales Tax Act, 1990 and 
Section 43 of Federal Excise Act, 2005 amid 
lockdowns and rise in Corona Virus cases and 
slowdown in the economy made by the Federal 
Board of Revenue vide its C. No. 3(22) S (IR- 
Operations)/2020 dated 30th June 2020 is ultra 
vires of the powers of the Federal Board of 
Revenue under Sections 214A of Income Tax 
Ordinance, 2001, Section 74 of Sales Tax Act, 
1990 and Section 43 of Federal Excise Act, 
2005?" 
2. 
Relevant facts of the case, briefly, are that legal proceedings 
were initiated against the respondent being an individual taxpayer 
deriving income from running a Rice Mills under the name & style of 
M/s Qader Dad Rice Mills, as a result of information available with the 
department that taxpayer had made investment for the purchase of 
immovable property measuring 25-kanals 11-marlas land for a 
consideration of Rs.8,500,000/-. In that regard, necessary notices under 

2 
Income Tax Reference No.64481 of 2022 
 
 
sections 122(9) and 111(1)(b) of the Ordinance each dated 16.11.2020 
were issued to the respondent who furnished reply dated 23.11.2020 
alongwith certain documents. The Officer Inland Revenue passed the 
Order in Original dated 31.12.2020 („OIR‟) and made addition under 
section 111(1)(b) of Rs.34,47,938/- while determining taxable income 
of the respondent at Rs.4,297,938/-. The respondent-taxpayer, being 
aggrieved of the OIR, filed first appeal before the Commissioner Inland 
Revenue (Appeals) („CIR(A)‟) raising various legal and factual grounds 
including the plea that the OIR was beyond limitation under Section 
122 of the Ordinance as limitation for the tax year 2014 in the instant 
case expired on 30.06.2020 whereas the OIR passed order on 
31.12.2020 and that the alleged extension in limitation granted by the 
FBR was neither valid nor applicable. The CIR(A) dismissed appeal of 
the respondent vide order dated 09.08.2021. The respondent, being 
aggrieved, preferred an appeal before the Tribunal against the 
aforementioned order passed by the CIR(A) being ITA No.4094/LB of 
2021 which was allowed vide order dated 17.05.2022 in the terms as 
follows:   
“For what has been stated above, we find that the extension 
of limitation as laid down in Section 122(2) cannot be 
altered, amended, changed by Federal Board of Revenue 
under the law as it amounts to legislation which exclusively 
falls in the domain of the Legislature and the exercise of 
power under section 214A cannot be inferred to be regarded 
as delegation of power to FBR to legislate, to amend the 
existing provision of a statute. 
As a sequel to the above, we cannot condone the act of the 
CIR/OIR in placing reliance on an extension of limitation 
granted through Notification dated 30.06.2020 as reliance 
whereof is of no legal effect. As this Appellate Tribunal is 
limiting its assessment of the case to the issue of limitation 
alone, there is no need to discuss the merits of the case.” 
3. 
Learned counsel for the applicant states that general condonation 
of limitation under Section 214A of the Ordinance was granted vide 
Notification dated 30.06.2020 amid lockdowns and rise in the COVID-
19 cases, which was issued with lawful authority, therefore, the 
impugned order of the Tribunal is clearly unsustainable in law.  

3 
Income Tax Reference No.64481 of 2022 
 
 
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent has supported the 
impugned order for the reasons stated therein.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
6. 
Section 120(1) of the 
Ordinance states that where a taxpayer has furnished a complete return 
under sub-section (6) of Section 114 of the Ordinance for a tax year, the 
same shall be taken to have made assessment of taxable income for that 
year. The Commissioner has been vested with authority under Section 
122, subject to the provisions of that section, to amend an assessment 
order under Section 120 by making such alterations or additions as the 
Commissioner considers necessary. For the purpose of amendment of 
assessment, not only sub-section (2) of Section 122 of the Ordinance 
specifies a period of limitation of five years from the end of the 
financial year in which the Commissioner has issued or treated to have 
issued the assessment order to the taxpayer but a prohibition has been 
stipulated on passing such order after expiry of the period of limitation 
prescribed. In the instant case, the order of amendment of assessment 
was passed on 31.12.2020 in relation to the tax year 2014 the period of 
limitation for which, in terms of Section 122(2) of the Ordinance, was 
due to expire on 30.06.2020.    
7. 
Section 214A of the Ordinance, at the relevant time, conferred 
authority upon the Federal Board of Revenue („Board‟) regarding 
condonation of time limit in the following terms:-  
Condonation of time limit.--Where any time or 
period has been specified under any of the 
provisions of the Ordinance or rules made there-
under within which any application is to be made or 
any act or thing is to be done, the Board may, in any 
case or class of cases, permit such application to be 
made or such act or thing to be done within such 
time or period as it may consider appropriate.  
 
 

4 
Income Tax Reference No.64481 of 2022 
 
 
8. 
In terms of Section 214A of the Ordinance, the Board has been 
empowered to permit any act or thing to be done within such period as 
it may consider appropriate after expiry of the time frame stipulated in 
the Ordinance. Passing an order for the amendment of assessment is 
certainly an act or thing to be done under the Ordinance. The limitation 
prescribed in Section 122(2) ibid is restricted in its application to 
section 122 of the Ordinance whereas Section 214A of the Ordinance is 
of general applicability and applies to all provisions of the Ordinance 
and rules framed thereunder. The purpose of Section 214A ibid 
apparently is to give a separate overriding power to the Board to permit 
any act or thing to be done under the statute within such time period as 
it may deem appropriate, which is independent of any other provision 
of the Ordinance that provides a time frame. Thus, while applying the 
principle of harmonious construction, it is found that the Board 
apparently has the power under Section 214A of the Ordinance to 
permit passing of an order under the aforesaid section within such time 
as it may consider appropriate. This, however, does not mean that in 
exercise of its discretionary power under Section 214A of the 
Ordinance, the Board can run riot to extend time whenever and for 
however long it feels expedient to do so. In exercise of such 
discretionary power, the Board cannot destroy vested rights or reopen 
past and closed transactions.    
9. 
It is trite law that the exercise of any discretionary power must be 
rational and have a nexus with the object of the underlying legislation. 
Arbitrariness is the antithesis of the rule of law. Whenever the 
legislature confers a wide ranging power, it must be deemed to have 
assumed that the power will be: firstly, exercised in good faith; 
secondly, for the advancement of the objects of the legislation; and 
thirdly in a reasonable manner. Section 24A of the General Clauses 
Act, 1897 reiterates the principle that statutory power is to be exercised 
reasonably, fairly, justly and for the advancement of the purposes of the 
enactment and further clarifies that an executive authority must give 
reasons for its decision. Needless to observe that such exercise of 
discretionary power remains amenable to judicial scrutiny. In the case 

5 
Income Tax Reference No.64481 of 2022 
 
 
of The Collector of Sales Tax, Gujranwala and others vs. Super Asia 
Muhammad Din and Sons and others (2017 PTD 1756) wherein, while 
interpreting identical provision of Section 74 of the Sales Tax Act, 
1990, the Supreme Court held as under:- 
“Thus we are of the opinion that while undoubtedly the 
Board has the power under section 74 supra to extend the 
time limit and permit an order under section 36 supra to be 
passed within such time or period as it may consider 
appropriate, such power must be exercised within a 
reasonable time period of six months from the date when the 
time period provided in the first proviso to section 36(3) 
supra and the extension granted thereunder have lapsed, and 
such power can only be exercised (by the Board under 
section 74 supra) to grant an extension of not more than a 
reasonable time period of six months.”  
However, in the case of Federal Board of Revenue through its 
Chairman, Islamabad and others vs. Abdul Ghani and another (2021 
SCMR 1154), the Supreme Court of Pakistan disapproved an order 
passed by the Board under Section 74 of the Act for the reason that the 
same failed to state any reason for extending the limitation period for 
issuance of show cause notice whereas in another case titled Faisalabad 
Electricity Supply Company Limited vs. The Federation of Pakistan and 
others (2021 SCMR 1463) it was held that the executive remedy under 
Section 74 of the Sales Tax Act was not permissible in relation to any 
proceedings which were pending before a judicial forum or had become 
time barred on account of judicial findings given by such a forum. 
However, where notice for amendment of assessment has been issued 
within the period of limitation prescribed in Section 122(2) of the 
Ordinance and final order therein could not be passed therein 
manifestly for any justifiable reason beyond the control of the revenue 
authority or the taxpayer, exercise of discretionary power on part of the 
Board under section 214A of the Ordinance to extend time to complete 
the proceedings within a reasonable period may be justified in our 
opinion. 
10. 
To ascertain whether the Board properly exercised its discretion 
inter alia under Section 214A of the Ordinance in granting general 
condonation of limitation here,  it is necessary to examine contents of the

Subject: General Condonation of Limitation U/S 214A of Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, 
Section 74 of Sales Tax Act, 1990 And Section 43 of Federal Excise Act, 2005- Amid 
Lockdowns And Rise In Corona Virus Cases__________________________________ 
I am directed to refer to the subject and to state that due to the situation created by COVID-
19 across the country resulting in lockdowns and slowdown in the economy, the Competent 
Authority has been pleased to grant general condonation of limitation U/S 214A of Income Tax 
Ordinance, 2001, section 74 of Sales tax Act, 1990, and section 43 of Federal Excise Act, 2005 up to 
31-12-2020 for finalization of proceedings in cases involving matters such as:- 
(i) 
Finalization of issues pertaining to tax year 2014; 
(ii) 
Cases set aside by appellate fora; 
(iii) 
Cases where notices in pursuance of section 122 of the Income 
Tax Ordinance, 2001 were issued prior to 30.06.2019 and are to 
be hit by limitation on 30.06.2020; 
(iv) 
 Sales Tax cases where mandatory period for issuing notices 
under sub-section 5 of section 11 of Sales Tax Act, 1990, is also 
expiring on 30.06.2020.

Finalization of proceedings under Federal Excise Act, 2005 in 
cases which are going to be hit by limitation on 30.06.2020.

11. 
From perusal of the Notification dated 30.06.2020, it is evident 
that general condonation of limitation under section 214A of the 
Ordinance has been granted for a period of six months manifestly on 
the pretext of the situation created by Covid-19 across the country 
resulting in lockdowns etc. On 11th March 2020 the World Health 
Organization declared the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a 
global pandemic. The said pandemic created uncertainty and stress for 
all sectors for reasons beyond their control with all markets closed, all 
factories, enterprises, in fact everything came to a standstill and all 
major economies world over announced bail out packages and 
regulatory relaxations under the various laws. Unprecedented 
lockdowns were announced in March 2020 while taking into 
consideration the spread of the deadly virus affecting people of all 
classes. In recognition of the situation, the Supreme Court of Pakistan, 

7 
Income Tax Reference No.64481 of 2022 
 
 
in exercise of powers under Article 191 of the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and the Supreme Court Rules, 1980 issued 
Notification dated 26.03.2020 to exclude the period of limitation under 
Section 4 of the Limitation Act, 1908 for the period specified therein 
for those litigants who were unable to approach the Supreme Court on 
account of the lockdown announced by the Federal/Provincial 
Governments. To somewhat similar effect, this Court issued 
Notification dated 27.03.2020 to exclude the limitation under Section 4 
of the Limitation Act, 1908 w.e.f. 24.03.2020. In our opinion, COVID-
19 pandemic provided a valid reason for the exercise of discretionary 
power under Section 214A of the Ordinance. Additionally, the 
condonation of limitation under the notification was until 31.12.2020 
i.e. the period of six months, which satisfies the requirements of 
proportionality and reasonableness as laid down by the Supreme Court 
in the case of Super Asia Muhammad Din and Sons and others (supra). 
Therefore, the Tribunal acted erroneously in declaring the Notification 
dated 30.06.2020 to be ultra vires and of no legal effect. Accordingly, 
the question referred to us for opinion is answered in negative. i.e. in 
favour of the applicant and against the respondent. 
12. 
Relief in the titled reference application, however, depends on 
how far the applicant is entitled to claim benefit of the Notification. The 
applicant has relied on clause (i) of the Notification to claim the benefit 
of extension of limitation under Section 214A of the Ordinance whereas 
it is case of the respondent that the period of limitation in cases falling 
under Section 122 of the Ordinance was manifestly extended in clause 
(iii) only and that too in cases where notices under that provision were 
issued prior to 30.06.2019 which undeniably was not the case here, and 
that clause (i) of the Notification had no applicability in the instant 
case.  
13. 
Undisputedly, clause (iii) of the Notification only applied to the 
class of cases wherein notice under Section 122 of the Ordinance was 
issued prior to 30.06.2019. In the instant case, such notice was issued 

8 
Income Tax Reference No.64481 of 2022 
 
 
on 30.11.2020, therefore, this case against the respondent did not fall 
within the ambit of clause (iii) of the Notification.  
14. 
Clause (i) of the Notification manifestly contained a general 
provision qua condonation of limitation for finalization of issues 
pertaining to tax year 2014 which, in its application, was not confined 
to the Ordinance. In the presence of a specific clause (iii), how far the 
general provision in clause (i) of the Notification would apply to extend 
limitation in cases under section 122 of the Ordinance is not free from 
doubt. Be that as it may, clause (i) of the Notification makes it 
abundantly clear that application of that provision is confined to 
“finalization” of issues pertaining to tax year 2014. The words 
“finalize” and “finalization” have not been defined in the Ordinance or 
the Notification, therefore, the same are to be construed in terms of 
ordinary grammatical meanings thereof as contained in the English 
Dictionary, some of which are reproduced herein below:- 
 
 
 
Chambers Concise Dictionary 
 
Finalize: 
1. to complete (an agreement or transaction) 
2. to arrive at the final form of something. Put the finishing 
touches to it. 
 
The American Heritage Dictionary (Fifth Edition) 
 
 
 
to put into final form. 
Random House Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary 
(Second Edition) 
      to put into final form, complete all the details of.  
 
Collins English Dictionary 
Finalization. A person, thing or even which finalizes a situation or 
process.       
15. 
From the above definitions, it is abundantly clear that 
“finalization” is synonym for closing, completion, culmination of 
something which is already in progress or has already been 
commenced. Therefore, applicability of clause (i) of the Notification is 
confined to extension of limitation in the class of cases involving tax 

9 
Income Tax Reference No.64481 of 2022 
 
 
year 2014 for closing or completion wherein proceeding had already 
been commenced within the period of limitation, which clearly is not 
the case here since the notice under Section 122 was issued to the 
respondent on 30.11.2020. We are unable to give expansive 
interpretation to the word “finalization” used in clause (i) of the 
Notification to authorize commencement of proceedings in relation to 
issues pertaining to tax year 2014 after expiry of the period of limitation 
specified in Section 122 of the Ordinance.   
16. 
For the foregoing reasons, the applicant is not entitled to the 
benefit of the Notification claimed by him, therefore, this reference 
application is dismissed.   
17. 
Office shall send a copy of this order under seal of the Court to 
the Tribunal as per Section 133(5) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001.
