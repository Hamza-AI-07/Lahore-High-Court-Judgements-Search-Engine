ASIM HAFEEZ, J.  These are three regular first appeals, bearing R.F.A. 
No.224/2018, R.F.A. No.171/2016 and R.F.A. No.132/2015 [collectively referred 
as „Appeals‟ and individually identified with specific number(s)], each one of 
which is against the decision(s) / judgment(s), separately passed by the Referee 
Court, in exercise of jurisdiction extended under section 18 of the Land 
Acquisition Act 1894 (the ‘Act, 1894’). Disputes are restricted to the extent of 
quantum of the compensation awarded, in lieu of compulsory acquisition of land, 
subject to single Award. In wake of commonality of the issues, legal and factual, 
all these appeals are decided through instant single decision. 
2. 
By and large, the facts bear similarity, differing to the extent of quantum of 
the compensation awarded to each of the landowner(s). Land in question was

situated in Mauza Taraf Ravi, Multan which was acquired for the purpose of 
developing Fatima Jinnah Town Phase-1, Scheme, Multan launched by Multan 
Development Authority („Authority‟). Notification under section 4 of the Act, 
1894 was issued on 28.07.2004 and same was gazetted on 05.08.2004. 
Notifications under section 6 and 17(4) of the Act, 1894 were issued on 28.06.2006 
and possession of the land was taken over and handed over to the Authority by 
23.12.2006. Compensation of Rs.21,000 per Marla was determined for the land 
having residential character and Rs.10,000/- per Marla for land bearing agricultural 
character. Award was announced on 28.04.2008. Compensation awarded and 
variation therein, subject matter of each of the appeals, are detailed hereunder,

First, I take up RFA No.224 of 2018 –[Appeal preferred by the Authority] -, 
which arose out of the judgment in Reference Application No.23/R of 2010. In 
Award, the compensation determined was Rs.21,000/- per Marla for land having 
residential character and Rs.10,000/- per Marla for land bearing agricultural 
character. Referee Court enhanced the compensation to Rs.38,500/- per Marla, 
treating entire land as residential, for the purposes of determining the 
compensation.

Learned counsel for the Appellant Authority contends that treating land 
alike, in contrast to having different features, is gross illegality. Adds that 
compensation was arbitrarily enhanced to Rs.38,500/- per Marla, without any 
justification and reasoning. 
 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondents submits that compensation 
cannot be determined simply upon considering the use of the land at the time of 
issuance of notification, but potentiality thereof has to be determined. Adds that 
sufficient evidence was produced to prove that parcel(s) of land were sold as 
residential, since 2001-2002. Adds that Referee Court had enhanced compensation 
in wake of huge potential value of the land, which falls within urban / municipal 
limits and purposely acquired for establishing housing scheme, which indicates its 
suitability-aptness for residential purposes. Adds that evidence produced regarding 
potential value of land remained unrebutted. 
5. 
Heard and record perused –RFA 224/2018. 
6. 
In terms of the Award, quantum of compensation for land used for 
residential purposes was valued at Rs.21,000/- per Marla and land under 
cultivation was valued at Rs.10,000/- Per Marla. I have examined the judgment by 
the Referee Court, which proceeded to enhance the rate of compensation in lieu of 
conspicuously established potentiality of the land in question. Land Acquisition 
Collector had treated subject land as partly residential and partly agricultural, 
which manifest that land could ably to put to use for residential purposes, 
irrespective of being used for agriculture purpose at the time of Notification. If part

of the land is classified as residential why cannot the land in vicinity / proximity 
thereto would be treated as residential, for computing fair amount of compensation. 
Scope and significance of ascertaining the potential value of the land, in the 
context of compulsory acquisition, under the principle of eminent domain, is well-
established, jurisprudentially. Potentiality of the land includes land‟s future value, 
economic potential and probable use(s) thereof, which inter alia includes 
development prospects of the land, in near future. In the case at hand, subject land 
was acquired for residential housing scheme – which strongly suggests and implies 
that before identification of the land, sought to be acquired for residential purposes, 
it was surveyed and found fit for such purpose, because of various factors, one of 
which being its territorial footprint in urban / municipal limits – since part of it was 
treated as residential – or in close proximity thereof. And activities carried in the 
vicinity. It was not the case that purely / exclusively agricultural land was acquired, 
situated at some far-flung distance from city / urban limits. Hence, suitability and 
appropriateness of the land for housing scheme provides undeniable insight into its 
potential value. Section 23 of the Act, 1894 provides benchmark for determination 
of the potentiality of the land – and jurisprudence to that extent is well-settled. 
Guidance is solicited from the ratio settled in the cases of “SARHAD 
DEVELOPMENT 
AUTHORITY 
N.W.F.P. 
(NOW 
KPK) 
through 
COO/CEO(OFFICIO) and others. Vs. NAWAB ALI KHAN and others.” (2020 
SCMR 265) and “PROVINCE OF PUNJAB through Land Acquisition Collector 
and another. Vs. BEGUM AZIZA” (2014 SCMR 75). All these factors were 
considered by the Referee Court, which reasoning is unexceptionable. I find no

Separate parcel(s) of land are subject of each of these Appeals, but facts 
therein substantially overlap. Land subject matter of aforesaid Appeals was treated 
as agricultural and compensation of Rs.10,000/- per Marla was awarded in respect 
thereof. Landowners, aggrieved, submitted reference application(s), which were 
dismissed without granting any enhancement in the compensation, on the premise 
that no evidence was produced to prove that land of the landowner(s) acquired, 
was classifiable as residential land, instead it was labelled as agricultural. Referee 
Court observed that sale deeds produced for showing voluntary transactions 
between the willing buyer(s) and sellers were executed much after the issuance of 
notification under section 4 of the Act, 1894, and handing down of the Award. 
Referee Court further observed that landowners failed to bring any evidence on 
record to show that land in question fell within the municipal limits. In view of 
these facts, aforesaid Appeals are adjudicated.  
Submissions. 
8. 
Learned counsel for the appellants in aforesaid Appeals - RFA No.171/2018 
and RFA No.132/2015 - contend that Referee Court failed to appreciate the potential 
value of the land, having proximity to the area/land having all attributes/ features 
of an urban locality, besides being declared suitable for the development of 
Housing Scheme–an undisputed fact. Adds that land subject matter of RFA No.224 
of 2018 fell within same Mauza Taraf Ravi, Multan, where land of the present 

RFA No.171/2016.

appellants was situated, and the former was compositely treated as residential land 
and valued as such. Adds that land of the appellants is in close proximity thereto, 
and land collectively acquired would be put to use for establishing housing 
scheme. Submits that purpose for which land was acquired substantiates its 
potential value. Adds that appellants are entitled to similar treatment by fixing 
compensation at Rs.38,5000/- per Marla. Strength is drawn from the decision in the 
case of “Malik TARIQ MAHMOOD and others. Vs. PROVINCE OF PUNJAB and 
others.” (2023 SCMR 102). 
9. 
Conversely, learned counsel for respondent Authority submits that no 
evidence was produced to justify the claim of enhancement. Adds that 
compensation was received without any objection and hence, no claim could be 
raised in terms of section 31(2) of the Act, 1894.

Heard. Record perused – RFA No. 132 of 2015 and RFA No. 171 of 2016. 
11. 
Purpose for which land was acquired and intended use thereof facilitates 
attributing predictability qua its potential value. Land in question was acquired for 
developing housing scheme, which manifest its suitability-cum-viability vis-à-vis 
for residential purposes. It is not disputed that land of the appellants fell in Mauza 
Taraf Ravi, wherefrom another parcel of land was acquired and assessed at 
Rs.38,500/- per marla for compensation payable to the landowner(s), whereby the 
Referee Court had treated the acquired parcel as residential, disagreeing with the 
classification by Land Acquisition Collector. If land in the vicinity was assessed in 
the context of having potentiality, whether is it fair to determine value of the land 
in the vicinity / proximity, differently. No special disability / disadvantage was

attributed to the land of the appellants, except that it was used for agricultural 
purposes or was under cultivation. Here, the Referee Court had erred in failing to 
appreciate the concept of potential value. There is no evidence on the record to 
establish remoteness of land of the appellants from the reference point – housing 
project or land subject matter of RFA No.224/2018. Potential value inter alia 
includes prospective use to which said land could be put to. Unless upon 
comparative analysis, potentiality of the agricultural land is found on the lower 
side, in the context of the objective of the project, appellants / landowners could 
not be deprived of fair compensation of their land. No adverse evidence is 
available to disentitle the appellants of the enhanced quantum of value of their 
land. Determining the potential value of the land merely in the context of use 
thereof, contemporaneously, is wrong. In this context guidance is solicited from 
the ratio settled in “Malik TARIQ MAHMOOD and others’ (supra), relevant 
paragraph is reproduced hereunder,  
“Before we enter upon considering the evidence adduced on 
the said issue, we deem it appropriate to state some of the 
principles on which compensation is required to be 
determined. Under section 23(1) of the Act, compensation is 
to be determined on the basis of the market value of the land 
at the date of publication of the notification under section 4 of 
the Act. The Court assessing compensation is required to take 
into consideration not only the present purpose or the present 
use to which the land is applied but also any other more 
beneficial purpose to which it might reasonably be put by the 
owner. Indubitably, it is true that regard can be had only to 
the existing conditions and what is likely to happen in 
reasonably near future and compensation cannot be fixed on 
the basis of what might happen in the dim and distant future. 
Where there is a reasonable possibility of the land being put 
to a more profitable use within a reasonable period the same 
cannot be ignored in assessing its value. Compensation has 
always to be determined by reference to the price which a 
willing vendor may reasonably expect to obtain from a 
willing purchaser. When the land possesses some unusual,

special or unique features as to its location or potentialities, 
due weight must be attached to all these elements. After 
considering all the circumstances, the Court has to arrive at a 
fair estimate with reference to the surrounding circumstances 
and evidence in the case and to award a fair compensation on 
that basis. The Court further ought to be liberal in the sense 
that it should not be too meticulous or pedantic in dealing 
with the evidence. It is also true that an entry in the revenue 
record as to the nature of the land may not be conclusive. If 
the land acquired is found to be useful both for agricultural 
or non-agricultural purposes, merely on the ground that it 
was used as agricultural land by the owner till the time of its 
acquisition, its potentiality as non-agricultural land cannot 
be ignored.”   
[Emphasis supplied] 
12. 
It is evident from the Notification under section 4 of the Act, 1894 that 
agricultural land was declared as situated within the municipal limits, which 
negates the position of the Authority and exposes the erroneousness of the decision 
of the Referee Court. I find no reason to remand the matter, when the potentiality 
of the land in the locality i.e. Mauza Taraf Ravi stood convincingly established 
with respect to the land, subject matter of RFA 224 of 2018. Hence, petitioner 
cannot be discriminated or treated differently.  
13. 
Objection that amount was received without any protest is misconceived. 
And even otherwise, section 31(2) of the Act, 1894 is neither attracted nor, in the 
facts and circumstances, be construed to the disadvantage of the appellants. In 
RFA No.171/2016 Malik Nazar Hussain appeared as AW-1, who was cross-
examined but not confronted with the receipt of payment to establish that money 
was received without any protest. AW-1, during cross-examination stated demand 
of seeking enhancement of compensation. Issue No.1 was framed regarding the 
maintainability of the reference application, which issue was decided against the

Authority due to failure to lead any evidence. It is notable that Authority submitted 
reply to the reference, wherein paragraph 7 of preliminary objections affirmed that 
owner was heard repeatedly, who requested for increase in the compensation but 
failed to produce documents. All this established that factum of unconditional 
receipt of consideration was not proved. Mere production of receipt showing 
receipt of money, without confrontation of the signatures to the appellant in 
question, would not attract penal consequence under second proviso of sub-section 
(2) of section 31 of the Act, 1894. Judgment in the case of “NATIONAL 
HIGHWAY AUTHORITY through Director. Vs. BASHIRAN BIBI and others.” 
(2024 MLD 1590) is distinguishable. 
  
Likewise, in RFA No.132/2015, one of the appellant Malik Mehar Hussain 
appeared as AW-1, who was cross-examined but not confronted with the receipt of 
payment to establish that money was received without any protest. RW-1 was the 
alleged receipt of payment, whereupon signatures / thumbmark of said witness was 
not confronted or shown. Signatures of other landowners were not alleged at all. 
Issues No.1 and 2 were framed regarding the maintainability of the reference 
application, which issues were decided against the Authority due to failure to lead 
any evidence. It is notable that Authority submitted reply to the reference, wherein 
paragraph 7 of preliminary objections affirmed that owner was heard repeatedly, 
who requested for increase in the compensation but failed to produce documents. 
Benefit extended to the landowners in RFA No.224/2018 cannot be denied to the 
appellants, whose case is substantially the same.

In view of the above, Appeals bearing RFA No.171/2016 and RFA 
No.132/2015 are allowed, and quantum of compensation with respect to the 
land(s), subject matter thereof, is enhanced to Rs.38,500/- per Marla for the land(s) 
in both Appeals – each of the appellants are entitled to receive enhanced 
compensation in lieu of their respective parcels of land(s) acquired. Appellants of 
aforesaid Appeals shall also be entitled to 15% compulsory acquisition on the 
amount of enhanced compensation and compound interest of 8% per annum from 
the date of taking of possession to the date of deposit / payment under section 28 of 
the Act, 1894, at the enhanced rate of compensation of the land(s), respectively. 
Amounts received by the appellants, so far, would accordingly be adjusted before 
making payments in terms of this judgment.  
 
R.F.A. No.224/2018 is dismissed.
