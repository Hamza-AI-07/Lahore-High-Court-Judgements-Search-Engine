    JUDGMENT 
Date of Hearing:

Petitioner by: 
Mr. Imran Muhammad Sarwar, Advocate.  
Respondent No.3 
by: 
Mr. Asad Ali Bajwa, Advocate.  
 
 
Anwaar Hussain, J:-  Through this single judgment, this Court 
intends to decide the present as well as connected constitutional 
petitions bearing W.P. No.43383/2021, W.P. No.43392/2021 and W.P. 
No.43406/2021 filed by different petitioners, who happen to be the 
members of the same family and vendees of one and the same person, 
namely, Surraya Jahan Khanam („the vendor‟) and the properties 
purchased by them have been pre-empted by one Mst. Tahira Shahid 
(„the pre-emptor‟), who is respondent No.3 in the present case and 
also the contesting respondent, in the connected matters. The identical 
legal question that boils down for determination by this Court is to 
examine the manner and the stage at which the application, under 
Section 24(1) of the Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1991 („the Act‟) is to be 
decided by the learned Trial Court.  
2. 
The factual matrix of the case is not disputed. Four suits were 
instituted by the pre-emptor. The sale price recorded in the sale deeds 
in present petition as well as connected petitions bearing W.P. 
No.43383/2021 and W.P. No.43392/2021 is Rs.30,000,000/-, whereas 

 
W.P. No.43399/2021 
 
2
the sale price recorded in sale deed forming subject matter of petition 
bearing W.P. No.43406/2021 is Rs.60,000,000/-. In the suits, the  
pre-emptor asserted that the price recorded in the sale deeds is inflated 
just to defeat her right of pre-emption and prevailing market rate per 
marla is Rs. 12,500/- and hence, the actual sale price of the properties 
in present petition as well as connected petitions bearing W.P. 
No.43383/2021 and W.P. No.43392/2021 is Rs. 4,000,000/- and not 
Rs.30,000,000/-, whereas the actual sale price of the property forming 
subject 
matter 
of 
petition 
bearing 
W.P. 
No.43406/2021 
is 
Rs.8,000,000/- and not Rs.60,000,000/-. The pre-emptor also filed an 
application under Section 24 of the Act for the determination of 
probable value of the properties pre-empted in each suit. Thereafter, on 
21.10.2014, the learned Trial Court directed the pre-emptor to deposit 
1/3rd of the amount recorded in the sale deeds and kept the said 
applications in the suits pending. The order of the learned Trial Court, 
to deposit zar-e-soem on the basis of the price recorded in the sale 
deeds was complied with, and the amount was accordingly deposited. 
The pre-emptor then filed an application, in each suit, for investing the 
amount of zar-e-soem in government securities. Admittedly, the same 
has been done. Later on, separate application in all four suits was filed 
by the pre-emptor for decision of the applications under Section 24 that 
was contested and, vide orders of even date 28.01.2019, the 
applications were dismissed. Order dated 28.01.2019 was assailed in 
separate revision petitions by the pre-emptor and, vide orders of even 
date 05.12.2019, the revision petitions were accepted, with consent of 
the parties and the matter was remanded to the learned Trial Court for 
decision afresh on the pending applications, of the petitioner, under 
Section 24. In post remand proceedings, another application, in each 
suit, under Order XIV Rule 2 was filed, by the pre-emptor with the 
prayer that issues No.3 and 4 already framed and settled regarding the 
determination of the sale price be treated as preliminary issues and the 
petitioners be directed to lead the evidence. This application was 

 
W.P. No.43399/2021 
 
3
accepted, vide order dated 12.11.2020, which was assailed by the 
petitioners by filing separate revision petitions that were also dismissed 
vide orders of even date 04.05.2021. Hence, present as well as 
connected constitutional petitions.  
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners contends that the impugned 
orders have been passed in a mechanical manner without appreciating 
the factual and legal position in its true perspective. Adds that the 
consent recorded by the petitioners was only to the extent of decision of 
the applications under Section 24 and not to treat issues No.3 and 4 as 
preliminary inasmuch as the said issues are factual in nature whereas 
only issues that relate to legal aspects of the matter can be treated as 
preliminary issues and decided in the first instance and places reliance 
upon case reported as “Shehzad Iqbal Malik v. Addl. District Judge and 
2 others” (2019 CLC 1320). Concludes that the petitioners still have 
no objection if the pending applications, under Section 24 are decided 
on the basis of any material/record, from the office of Sub Registrar 
concerned, etc., related to similar properties to ascertain the sale price 
provided issues No.3 and 4 are decided along with remaining issues 
through the final judgment.   
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the pre-emptor submits that the 
present as well as connected petitions are not maintainable on the 
ground that once the revisional jurisdiction is exercised by the learned 
Courts below based on the consent of the parties, constitutional 
jurisdiction by this Court is barred. Places reliance upon case reported 
as “Amer Khan v. Judge, Family Court” (2009 MLD 1011) and 
“Muhammad Yousaf v. Manzoor Ahmed and another” (PLD 2006 Lah 
738). Adds that inadvertently in the applications Order XIV Rule 2 of 
the CPC has been referred whereas the applications, in fact, were filed 
under Order XVIII, Rules 1 & 2 of the CPC which pertains to leading 
the evidence and in the case in hand, the onus as far as issues No. 3 and 
4 are concerned in the first instance is on the petitioners to discharge 

 
W.P. No.43399/2021 
 
4
and hence, the petitioners are obligated to prove that the price recorded 
in their respective sale deeds is not inflated. Adds that order dated 
05.12.2019 in the matter has attained finality and the petitioners cannot 
back out from the same. Further contends that it is sine qua non in a 
pre-emption suit to decide the application under Section 24 before 
proceeding further and therefore, the learned Courts below have rightly 
treated issues No.3 and 4 as preliminary issues. Places reliance upon 
the cases reported as Amer Khan supra and “Muhammad Yousaf and 3 
others v. Mst. Zubeda Begum and another” (1993 MLD 2138).  
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
6. 
Before examining the merits of the case and answering the legal 
questions involved, it is imperative to address the objection of learned 
counsel for the pre-emptor regarding the maintainability of the 
constitutional petitions. In this regard, emphasis has been laid on the 
point that once the jurisdiction is exercised by the Revisional Court 
below, recourse to the constitutional jurisdiction is not permissible. The 
argument is misconceived inasmuch as every case has its own peculiar 
facts and where the Revisional Court errs in appreciating the 
controversy in its proper perspective or otherwise decides the matter 
erroneously that can lead to defeating the object of the law on the 
subject, this Court has power in its supervisory and/or constitutional 
jurisdiction to rectify such an error. Hence, this Court is of the opinion 
that the petitions are maintainable. The case law referred by learned 
counsel for the petitioners has been considered but is not of any help to 
the respondent, on account of distinguishable facts of the present cases.  
7. 
Adverting to the legal question involved in the present as well as 
the connected petitions that requires opinion of this Court as to whether 
in the given facts and circumstances of the case, ascertainment of price 
of the pre-empted property (ies) is to be taken up as a preliminary issue,  
 

 
W.P. No.43399/2021 
 
5
in terms of proviso to Section 24(1) of the Act read with Order XIV 
Rule 2 of the CPC or whether such an issue is to be decided alongwith 
other issues already framed in the case, it is advantageous to reproduce 
Section 24 of the Act that reads as under: 
 
 
“24. Plaintiff to deposit sale price of the 
property-(1) In every suit for pre-emption the Court 
shall require the plaintiff to deposit in such Court one-
third of the sale price of the property in cash within 
such period as the Court may fix: 
 
 
 
Provided that such period shall not extent 
beyond thirty days of the filing of the suit: 
 
 
 
Provided further that if no sale price is 
mentioned in the sale-deed or in the mutation, or the 
price so mentioned appears to be inflated, the Court 
shall require deposit of one-third of the probable value 
of the property.  
 
 
(2)   Where the plaintiff fails to make a deposit 
under subsection (1) within the period fixed by the Court 
or withdraws the sum so deposited by him, his suit shall 
be dismissed.  
 
 
(3)   Every sum deposited under subsection (1) 
shall be available for the discharge of costs.  
 
 
(4)    The probable value fixed under subsection 
(1) shall not affect the final determination of the price 
payable by the pre-emptor.” 
It is mandate of the law that once a suit for pre-emption is instituted 
and an application is also filed for determining the tentative price for 
the purpose of depositing zar-e-soem, an inquiry/probe is to be made 
which in the present cases, the learned Trial Court decided not to 
conduct and passed a direction to deposit zar-e-some on the basis of the 
amount recorded in the sale deeds that are registered documents having 
presumption of truth attached to them unless the same are cancelled by 
the competent authority.  
8. 
It is admitted feature of the case that in the suits for pre-emption, 
followed by filing of applications for ascertaining the price for the 

 
W.P. No.43399/2021 
 
6
purpose of depositing zar-e-soem, the pre-emptor was directed to 
deposit zar-e-soem in terms of the amounts recorded in the sale deeds 
while the applications remained pending and the said order to deposit 
zar-e-soem was complied with and the amount so deposited was 
invested in various investment schemes at the specific request of the 
pre-emptor. The order having been acted upon, if allowed to be 
reopened, it will not put an end to the litigation, which is not the object 
of law. It is settled principle of law that procedural rules should be so 
interpreted and applied that justice may be handy and quickly available. 
It is also admitted feature of the case that the issues have already been 
framed, which, inter alia, include issues regarding the ascertainment of 
the price. The issues settled in present petition, that are identical to 
issues framed in connected cases except to extent of price and 
particulars of sale deeds, are reproduced hereunder: 
 
“1. 
Whether plaintiff has right of pre-emption regarding suit 
property against the defendants? OPP  
 
2. 
Whether plaintiff has fulfilled the requisite Talabs in 
accordance with law? OPP 
 
3. 
Whether sale price Rs.3,00,00,000/- mentioned in the sale 
deed No.7327 dated 23.06.2014 was actually fixed and 
paid by the defendants as consideration of suit property? 
OPD 
 
4. 
If issue No.3 is proved in negative then what is the market 
value of suit property? OP Parties 
 
5. 
Whether plaintiff has filed this suit just to harass the 
defendants and defendants are entitled to recover special 
costs, if so, to what extent? OPD 
 
6. 
Whether suit is incorrectly valued for purpose of court fee 
and jurisdiction, if so, what is its correct valuation? OPD 
 
7. 
Whether suit in hand has been got instituted through 
plaintiff by her father for his own interest, so, its effect? 
OPD 
 
8. 
Relief.” 

 
W.P. No.43399/2021

Once the pre-emptor complied with the order dated 21.10.2014 and 
deposited zar-e-soem, decision on the application of the pre-emptor 
becomes meaningless. Perusal of the record reveals that comprehensive 
issues, as per divergent pleadings of the parties, were settled about 
eight years ago. The pre-emptor instead of pursuing that the litigation 
should be decided on its merits, after recording of evidence of the 
parties, for the reasons best known to her, has prayed for decision of 
issues No.3 and 4 in the first instance by treating them as preliminary. 
Certainly, issues No.3 and 4, if treated as preliminary with a direction 
to the petitioners/defendants to lead the evidence while postponing the 
trial of the pre-emption suits on the other material issues pertaining to 
talbs, the burden of proof whereof is upon the pre-emptor/ plaintiff, the 
trial will not only be lingered on but the same is not permissible under 
the law.  
9. 
The matter can be examined from another angle. Admittedly, 
issues No.3 and 4 are factual in nature and at this juncture, needless to 
mention that as per mandate of the applicable law, as envisaged under 
Rule 2 of Order XIV, CPC, where issues, both of law and fact, arise 
and the Court is of the opinion that it should dispose of the issues of 
law only, it is obligatory for it to try the same first and for that purpose, 
the Court may, if it deems appropriate, postpone the settlement of 
issues of fact until the issues of law have been determined, however, if 
the decision is required on issues of law and the Court is called upon to 
record evidence of the parties, even in such eventuality, such legal 
issues should be decided alongwith the remaining issues on facts. 
Having above legal position in sight, it is observed that in the cases in 
hand, soon after the settlement of the issues, the pre-emptor did not 
make any such request rather acted upon the direction of the Court to 
deposit the amount of zar-e-soem as per the amount recorded in the sale 
deeds executed in favour of the petitioners, rendering his pending 
applications filed prior to framing of issues infructuous, and hence, 
estopped to agitate the same. Needless to mention that being factual in 

 
W.P. No.43399/2021 
 
8
nature, issues No. 3 and 4 cannot be decided in isolation with the 
remaining issues which are even more pertinent and goes to the root of 
the lis as the same relate to the talbs purportedly exercised by the pre-
emptor, in accordance with law. It is only once the said burden is 
discharged by the pre-emptor/plaintiff and the Court reaches the 
conclusion that a case of pre-emption has been setup, then the Court is 
required to proceed and determine the sale price in terms of Section 
24(4) of the Act. Decision regarding the ascertainment of the price at 
this stage by way of decisions on issues No.3 and 4 will make exercise 
of power/duty of the Court under Section 24(4) redundant.  
10. 
On a pointed question as to the scope of Section 24(4), which 
becomes redundant if the decision on issues No.3 and 4 is rendered in 
the first instance, learned counsel for the pre-emptor could not offer 
any plausible argument to refute the same. It is pertinent to observe that 
determination of probable value under proviso to Section 24(1) of the 
Act is only tentative in nature that is to be made on the basis of 
available record or any preliminary probe without recording of 
evidence and before direction is passed to deposit zar-e-soem and 
cannot be equated with the determination, which is to be made after 
framing of issues and recording of evidence that falls under the purview 
of Section 24(4) of the Act. Suffice to observe that the former 
determination can be made even though the right of the pre-emptor is 
yet to be established whereas the latter determination is to follow the 
establishment of right of pre-emption and if a pre-emptor/plaintiff fails 
to establish his right, the determination under Section 24(4) of the Act 
is not required to be made. Therefore, this Court is of the opinion that 
in the instant case, stage of determination of probable value under 
proviso to Section 24(1) of the Act has gone by and acted upon and 
even the consent of the petitioners/defendants cannot rewind the clock 
and any determination while deciding issues No.3 & 4 prior to 
establishment of right of the pre-emption amounts to putting a cart 
before the horse.

11. 
In view of the above discussion, the present as well as connected 
constitutional petitions are allowed and the applications of the pre-
emptor filed under Order XIV, Rule 2 read with Order XVIII, Rules 1 
& 2 of the CPC are dismissed.
