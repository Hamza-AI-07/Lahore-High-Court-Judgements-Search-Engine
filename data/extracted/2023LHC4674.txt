    ===== 
 
Through this criminal revision under Section 
435 & 439 Cr.P.C. the State through Prosecutor 
General, Punjab has called in question validity of 
impugned order dated 17.08.2023 passed by 
learned Duty Judge, Anti Terrorism Court, 
Faisalabad, 
whereby, 
upon 
the 
request 
of 
Investigating Officer of case FIR No.1261/23, 
dated 16.08.2023, in respect of offence under 
Sections 295,295-A, 324, 452, 353, 186, 438, 427, 
148,149,153-A PPC and Section 7-1 (I,H,G,D) of 
Anti Terrorism Act, 1997, registered at P.S. City 
Jaranwala, District Faisalabad, two days physical 
remand of accused/respondents No.1 to 33 was 
granted.  
2. 
Learned Law Officer submits that the 
impugned order of learned Duty Judge, Anti 
Terrorism Court, is illegal and without lawful 
authority; that according to Section 21-E of Anti 
Terrorism Act, 1997, it was mandatory for the 
Court to grant physical remand not less than fifteen 
days at one time; that grant of remand for only two 
days by the Court is violative of said mandatory 
provisions of law and is liable to be set-aside.

3. 
We have heard the arguments advanced by 
the learned Law Officer and gone through the 
record.  
4. 
Main thrust of the arguments of learned Law 
Officer is that grant of remand less than fifteen 
days at one time by the Anti Terrorism Court is 
violative of the mandatory provisions of Section 
21-E of the Act ibid, however, while going through 
the request of the Investigating Officer, it is quite 
clear that he himself requested for physical remand 
of the respondents for fourteen days and one can 
see with a naked eye that subsequently in order to 
make out a case for violation of Section 21-E of 
the Act ibid, a cutting was made and the words 
“fourteen” were changed into “fifteen” by the 
Investigating Officer without even initializing the 
said cutting. Since the Investigating Officer, 
himself requested physical remand for less than 
fifteen days, therefore, the prosecution cannot 
press into service the violation of said Section by 
the Court. Moreso, the impugned order for grant of 
two days physical remand was passed on 
17.08.2023 but the same was not challenged at the 
said time and the Investigating Officer felt 
satisfied in getting physical remand of respondents 
for period of six days on 19.08.2023 and then for 
five days on 24.08.2023 and thereafter himself 
placed a request before the Anti-Terrorism Court 
for sending them to judicial lock up which was 
duly accorded by the said Court. Subsequently,   
the prosecution woke up from deep slumber and 
rushed 
to 
this 
Court 
by 
complaining                   
that  mandatory provisions of Section 21-E  of  the                     

Crl.Revision No.57693/23 
 
 
 
 
 
3 
 
 
Act has been violated by the Anti Terrorism Court. 
The respondents have been sent on judicial remand 
at the request of Investigating Officer, therefore, 
after this development the prosecution is barred to 
agitate the grant of physical remand.  
5. 
Besides above, according to learned Law 
Officer provision of Section 21-E of the Act ibid is 
mandatory in nature. Before proceeding further it 
is appropriate to go through the said section which 
reads as under:- 
“21-E Remand.—(1) Where a person is 
detained for investigation, the Investigating Officer, within 
twenty-four hours of the arrest, excluding the time necessary 
for the journey from the place of arrest to the Court, shall 
produce the accused before the Court, and may apply for 
remand of the accused to police custody, [ or custody to any 
other Investigating Agency joined in the investigation] for 
which the maximum period allowed may be [not less [fifteen 
days and not more] than thirty days at one time]: (emphasis 
supplied) 
Provided that, where an accused cannot within 
twenty-four hours be produced before the Court, a temporary 
order for police custody,[ or custody of any other Investigating 
Agency joined in the investigation] not exceeding twenty-four 
hours may be obtained from the nearest Magistrate for the 
purpose of producing the accused before the Court within that 
period.  
 (2)------- 
(3) The Court shall be deemed to be a Magistrate for the 
purpose of sub-section (1)”:” 
6. 
The word “may” used in the above section is 
of pivotal importance. Ordinarily, the use of 
expression “may” is considered to be a permissive 
or enabling sense. In case reported as “ Abu Bakar 
Siddique and others ..Vs.. Collector of Customs, 
Lahore and others (2006 SCMR 705) the Apex 
Court has observed as under:- 
“ It is well-settled that word ‘may’ is discretionary 
and an enabling word and unless the subject-matter shows that 

Crl.Revision No.57693/23 
 
 
 
 
 
4 
 
 
the exercise of power given by the provision using the word 
‘may’ was intended to be imperative for the person to whom 
the power is given, it might not put him under an obligation to 
necessarily exercise such power but if it is capable of being 
construed as referring to statutory duty, it will not be entirely 
for such person to exercise or not to exercise the power given 
to him under the law. The use of word ‘may’ in the statute in 
the plain meanings is to give discretion to the public 
authorities to act in their option in the manner in which such 
authorities deem proper but if the public authorities to 
discharge their functions in their option in a positive sense, the 
word “may,” used in the provision would be suggestive of 
conveying the intention of legislature of imposing an 
obligation. The word “may” usually and generally does not 
mean “must” or “shall” but it is always capable of meaning 
“must” if the discretionary power is conferred upon a public 
authority with an obligation under the law. The word “may” is 
not always used in the statute with the intention and purpose to 
given uncontrolled powers to an authority rather oftenly it is 
used to maintain the statues of the authority on whom the 
discretionary power is conferred as an obligation and thus, the 
legislative expression in the permissive form, sometime is 
construed mandatory.” 
No doubt there are cases in which the word 
“may” is used in the imperative sense. Such 
instances are set out by Maxwell in “Interpretation 
of Statutes” and Craies in his “Statute Law”. In 
support of the proposition that when statutes 
authorise persons to do acts for the benefit of 
others or for public good or the advancement of 
justice, the use of the expression “may” has a 
compulsory force, Craies has cited Julius v. Bishop 
of Oxford (18880) 5 App. Cas.214, 225, 241), 
B.v.Bishop of Oxford (1879 4 Q B D 245,258) and 
R.v.Barlow (1693)2 Salk 609) while Maxwell has 
relied upon R.v.Tithe Commissioners (1850) 14 
QB 474) and R.D.C. v. Roberts (1950 1 KB 716). 
It would be advantageous to reproduce the 
following 
paragraph 
from 
‘Maxwell 
on 

Crl.Revision No.57693/23

Interpretation of Statutes’ Eleventh Edition, page 
235:- 
“ The Supreme Court of the United States- similarly 
laid it down that which public officers are empowered to do 
for a third person the law requires shall be done whenever the 
public interest or individual rights call for the exercise of the 
power, since latter is given, not for their benefit, but for his, 
and is placed with the depository to meet the demands of right 
and to prevent the failure of justice. In all such cases, the 
Court observed, the intention of the legislature, which is the 
test, is not to grant mere discretion, but to impose a positive 
and absolute duty.” 
Here in the instant case, the provision of 
above reproduced section directly relates to 
curtailing liberty of an accused. It is well settled by 
now that where two interpretations of law are 
possible, the interpretation beneficial to the 
accused should be preferred. Reliance is placed on 
case reported as “Mst. Shahista Bibi and another 
..Vs.. Superintendent, Central Jail, Mach and 2 
others ( PLD 2015 Supreme Court 15)’, wherein it 
has been laid down as under:- 
“ It is also hard and fast principle of interpretation of 
criminal law, which curtails the liberty of a person that it 
should be construed very strictly and even if two equal 
interpretations are possible then the favourable to the accused 
and his liberty must be adopted and preferred upon the 
contrary one.” 
In view of what has been discussed above, 
we are unanimous in holding that power to grant 
physical remand of an accused for not less than 
fifteen days at one time to the Court is 
discretionary and not mandatory in nature. It is in 
exclusive domain of the Court dealing with such 
request to grant remand for a period which it feels 
necessary keeping in view facts and circumstances 

Crl.Revision No.57693/23

of each case, therefore, the submission of the 
learned Law Officer that grant of remand less than 
fifteen days at one time by the Anti Terrorism 
Court is violative of Section 21-E of the Act ibid, 
being misconceived is repelled.  
7. 
Physical remand of an accused cannot be 
granted in routine. A duty is bestowed upon a 
Court dealing with such request of remand to 
protect fundamental rights of life and liberty of a 
person enshrined in the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973. Article 4 of the 
Constitution reads as under:- 
4. Right of individuals to be dealt 
with in accordance with law, etc. –(1) To 
enjoy the protection of law and to be treated in accordance 
with law is the inalienable right of every citizen, wherever he 
may be, and of every other person for the time being within 
Pakistan  
(2) In particular— 
(a) no action detrimental to the life, liberty body, reputation or 
property of any person shall be taken except in accordance 
with law;  
(b) no person shall be prevented from or be hindered in doing 
that which is not prohibited by law; and  
(c) no person shall be compelled to do which the law does not 
require for him.”  
Part-II 
of 
the 
Constitution 
provides 
fundamental rights to every citizen. Article 9 reads 
as under:- 
9. Security of person.—No person shall be 
deprived of life or liberty save in accordance with law.  
It is, therefore, in the above context that in Part B 
Chapter,11-B Volume-3 of Rules and Orders of 

Crl.Revision No.57693/23

Lahore High Court, Lahore following principles 
are laid down for the guidance of all the concerned 
for granting physical remand. 
“(i) Under no circumstances should an accused person be 
remanded to Police custody unless it is made clear that his 
presence is actually needed in order to serve some important 
and specific purpose connected with the completion of the 
inquiry. A general statement by the officer applying for the 
remand that the accused may be able to give further 
information should not be accepted. 
(ii) When an accused person is remanded to Police custody the 
period of the remand should be as short as possible . 
(iii) In all ordinary cases in which time is required by the 
Police to complete the inquiry, the accused person should be 
detained in magisterial custody. 
(iv) Where the object of the remand is merely the verification 
of the prisoner's statement, he should be remanded to 
magisterial custody. 
(v) An accused person who has made a confession before a 
Magistrate should be sent to the Judicial lock-up and not made 
over to the Police after the confession has been recorded. If 
the Police subsequently require the accused person for the 
investigation, a written application should be made giving 
reasons in detail why he is required and an order obtained 
from the Magistrate for his delivery to them for the specific 
purposes named in the application. If an accused person, who 
has been produced for the purpose of making a confession, has 
declined to make a confession or has made a statement which 
is unsatisfactory from the point of view of the prosecution he 
should not be remanded to Police custody.” 
It has been specifically mentioned in the 
above principles that period of remand should be 
as short as possible. Sub-section 3 of Section 21-E 
of the Act ibid specifically provided that the 
Special Court under Anti Terrorism Act, 1997 
while dealing with the matters of remand of an 
accused shall be deemed to be a Magistrate, 
therefore, it is incumbent upon such Court to 
strictly adhere to the provisions of sub section (3) 
of Section 167 Cr.P.C, which provides that  “A 
Magistrate authorizing under this section detention in the custody of 
the police shall record his reasons for so doing” Reliance in this 
regard is placed on case reported as “Raja Waheed 
Mehfooz ..Vs.. Special Judge, Anti Terrorism 
Court-II, Rawalpindi and 2 others (2016 P Cr.LJ 
1773).” It is thus evidently clear that while dealing 

Crl.Revision No.57693/23

with the request of physical remand of an accused 
the Anti Terrorism Court is not supposed to act 
merely as a post office and grant physical remand 
in a mechanical manner rather it is incumbent upon 
it to go through the entire record, apply its 
judicious mind and record the reasons in writing   
for acceding such request. Herein the instant case, 
the Anti Terrorism Court, while comprehending 
correct proposition of law rightly grant physical 
remand of respondents for a period, which it 
deems appropriate and no exception can be drawn 
therefrom.  
Resultantly, instant petition being devoid of 
any force stands dismissed in limine.
