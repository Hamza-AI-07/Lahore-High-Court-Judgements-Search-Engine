Shahid Karim, J:-. This constitutional petition brings a 
challenge to the order dated 11.03.2024 (the Impugned 
Order) passed by the Election Commission of Pakistan 
(ECP).  In conclusion, it was held that: 
“15. 
Likewise, this Commission is bound to conduct and 
hold free, fair and just election in term of Article 218 and 
222 of the Constitution and to fulfill end of justice may 
exercise its inherent power in term of section 4 of the 
Election Act, 2017, in any matter pending before it, at any 
stage, even after consolidation of result is concluded.  
 
16.  
As the reasons, given by the concern R.O for non-
recounting of votes are not appealable to prudent mind and 
we also cannot appreciate that any order be passed by any 
election officer under pressure on cost of legal rights 
already accrued to a party, therefore keeping in view, the 
reasons mentioned herein above, we accept this petition 
only to the extent of re-counting of specific polling stations 
and consequently set aside the impugned order dated 10th 
February, 2024 according.  
 
17. 
The concern R.O is directed to arrange for re-
counting of votes of specified polling stations mentioned in 
the list Annexed (A) attached here to this order and 
conclude the require proceeding of re-counting within 10 
days positively but strictly in accordance with prescribed 
law and rules and thereafter the conclusion of proceeding, 
what may be the result of recount, follow the law 
accordingly.”

2. 
These proceedings before the Election Commission of 
Pakistan (ECP) arose out of an appeal filed by respondent 
No.3 to challenge the order dated 10.02.2024 passed by the 
Returning Officer of NA-81 in respect of general elections 
held on 08.02.2024.  Respondent No.3 had filed an 
application for recount of the ballot papers of certain polling 
stations which was dismissed by the Returning Officer on 
10.02.2024 in the following terms: 
“Whereas, Mr. Azhar Qayyum Nahra candidate NA 81 
Gujranwala-V has submitted an application wherein he has 
submitted that polling staff has illegally declared his votes 
in connivance with his rival candidate. Due to this illegal 
act he has lost his seat. He has requested to order 
recounting of his votes as per law.  
 
And whereas, the undersigned has perused his record and 
the evidence put forth by the applicant. However, the 
applicant has failed to substantiate his claim.  
 
Now, therefore I Muhammad Naveed Haider, Returning 
Officer NA-81, Gujranwala-V hereby dismissed his 
application being devoid of facts.” 
 
3. 
As explicated, respondent No.3 filed an appeal against 
the said order passed by the Returning Officer.  It is 
common ground that an appeal is not competent before ECP 
but that aspect of the matter should not detain us any further 
as ECP treated the petition one under Section 8 of the 
Election Act, 2017 (“the 2017 Act”).  While doing so, the 
provisions of Articles 218 and 222 of the Constitution of 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (“the Constitution”) 
and section 4 of 2017 Act were also stated to be engaged in 
the order passed by ECP. 
4. 
The facts are refreshingly simple and may be stated 
briefly.  The petitioner and respondent No.3 were candidates 
in the general elections for the seat of National Assembly 
from NA-81 Gujranwala-V held on 08.02.2024.  The 
petitioner participated as an independent candidate and was 

W.P No.16416 of 2024 
 
3
declared as a returned candidate.  He won the elections with 
a majority of 117,717 votes in the provisional consolidated 
result undertaken by the Returning Officer.  The final 
consolidation proceedings were held and a notification 
regarding the petitioner as a returned candidate to the 
National Assembly of Pakistan was issued on 16.02.2024 by 
ECP.  As stated above, respondent No.3 had filed an 
application on 09.02.2024 for recount of the ballot papers to 
the Returning Officer.  That application was decided on 
10.02.2024.  A further petition to ECP was brought and 
decided by the impugned order passed on 11.03.2024.  By 
that time not only the notification in respect of the petitioner 
as a successful candidate had been issued on 16th February, 
2024, the Election Tribunals had also been notified vide 
notification dated 20.02.2024 for determination of post-
election disputes under Article 225 of the Constitution.  
Pursuant to the orders passed by ECP on 11.03.2024, a 
recount was held and respondent No.3 was declared as the 
successful candidate.  Consequently, revised Forms 47, 48 
and 49 were issued by respondent No.2 and a notification 
dated 18.03.2024 was also issued by ECP. 
5. 
Primarily, the petitioner contended before ECP that 
since a notification under Section 98 had already been issued 
and the petitioner had taken oath of membership of the 
National Assembly, the petition filed by the respondent No.3 
had become infructuous and ECP was denuded of its powers 
to proceed to  determine the issues raised in that petition.  In 
short, the submission was that the necessary jurisdictional 
facts did not exist for ECP to exercise its powers under any 
of the provisions of the 2017 Act. 

W.P No.16416 of 2024 
 
4
6. 
A reading of the impugned order would show that ECP 
primarily relied upon section 8 of the 2017 Act to upend the 
order passed by the Returning Officer and to direct recount 
of ballot papers.  Section 8 provides that: 
“8. Power of Commission to ensure fair election.— Save as 
otherwise provided, the Commission may— 
(a) stop the polls at one or more polling stations at any stage of the 
election if it is convinced that it shall not be able to ensure the 
conduct of the election justly, fairly and in accordance with law 
due to large scale malpractices, including coercion, 
intimidation and pressures, prevailing at the election; 
(b) review an order passed by an officer under this Act or the 
Rules, including rejection of a ballot paper; and 
(c) issue such instructions, exercise such powers and make such 
consequential orders as may in its opinion, be necessary for 
ensuring that an election is conducted honestly, justly, fairly 
and in accordance with the provisions of this Act and the 
Rules.” 
 
7. 
Thus, the only issue before this Court is regarding true 
construction to be put on section 8 of the 2017 Act and as to 
whether the said provision could be invoked by ECP in 
directing the recount of ballot papers by setting aside the 
order passed by Returning Officer.  Section 8, it can be seen, 
confers general powers on ECP to ensure fair elections and 
is couched in the same terms as Article 218 of the 
Constitution.  This begs the question: Does section 8 confer 
a regulatory blank check on ECP to pass any order in its 
discretion under any circumstances?  The arguments in this 
Court of learned counsel for respondent No.3 (and ECP) 
centered on clause (b) of section 8 which empowers the 
Commission to review an order passed by an officer under 
this Act or the rules including rejection of ballot papers.  
Clause (c) would also be engaged in the matter which 
confers power on the Commission to issue instructions and 
exercise such powers and make such consequential orders as 
may in its opinion be necessary for the conduct of just and 
fair elections.  There is no contention that the powers 

W.P No.16416 of 2024 
 
5
conferred upon ECP by section 8 are broad-based and does 
clothe ECP with necessary armoury of powers to ensure fair 
elections.  These powers, however, are circumscribed by 
other provisions of the 2017 Act and cannot be so conferred 
as to encroach upon the powers conferred upon other bodies 
established by the provisions of the 2017 Act.  Superior 
courts have generally construed such powers to mean that 
they must not be extended in such a way that ECP may have 
unbridled and unstructured powers to intervene at any stage 
of the elections at its whim.  The principles gleaned from 
different judgments of the superior courts are that the 
powers of ECP in this regard are circumscribed and derived 
powers. 
8. 
Two facts will exercise a gravitational pull on the 
decision of the present case.  One regarding the notification 
issued in respect of the petitioner as a successful candidate 
on 16.02.2024 by ECP and second, a notification regarding 
constitution of Election Tribunals on 20.02.2024 would also 
be a relevant factor. 
9. 
Section 8 of the 2017 Act  came under discussion 
before the Supreme Court of Pakistan in C.P No.142 of 2019 
Zulfiqar Ali Bhatti v. Election Commission of Pakistan and 
others in which the Supreme Court of Pakistan alluded to 
the true construction to be put on Article 218 (3) of the 
Constitution as well as section 8(c) of the 2017 Act.  The 
relevant portions are set out below: 
“18. Thus, we can safely conclude on the question of the 
status of the general power of the Election Commission 
under Article 218(3) of the Constitution vis-à-vis a law 
enacted by the Parliament, that this power operates in the 
area uncovered by such law. Alike is the scope and 
applicability of the powers of the Election Commission 
under Section 8(c) of the Elections Act, which is also 

W.P No.16416 of 2024 
 
6
evident from the opening words of Section 8, “Save as 
otherwise provided”. These words indicate that if 
something otherwise is provided in the Elections Act, then 
this Section will not apply. Further, the amplitude of the 
power of the Election Commission under this Section, like 
its general power under Article 218(3), is extended to the 
performance of its executive duty to “conduct the election” 
and thus it can be exercised only at any stage of the election 
process, not after the completion thereof. 
 
19. In other words, we can say, the general power under 
Article 218(3) of the Constitution and Section 8(c) of the 
Elections Act can be exercised by the Election Commission 
within two parameters: (i) during the election process, 
which starts with the issuance of the election programme 
and culminates with the publication of the name of the 
returned candidates in the official gazette, and (ii) when 
there is no express provision in the law enacted by the 
Parliament to deal with the matter or issue that arises 
during the performance of constitutional duty of conducting 
the elections honestly, justly, fairly and in accordance with 
law. 
 
20. In the present case, the Election Commission passed the 
impugned order after the consolidation of the final result of 
the poll by the Returning Officer under Section 95 and the 
publication of the name of the appellant as a returned 
candidate in the official gazette under Section 98 of the 
Elections Act, when the election process has been 
completed… 
 
21. The second limitation on the exercise of its general 
power by the Election Commission under Article 218(3) of 
the Constitution read with Section 8(c) of the Elections Act 
is, however, found attracted. The matter of directing a re-
poll or a fresh poll by the Election Commission in the 
process of conducting the election has expressly been dealt 
with in the Elections Act. There are three provisions in the 
Elections Act that deal with this matter in relation to the 
duty and power of the Election Commission to “conduct the 
election”, which are Sections 9, 88 and 121 of the Elections 
Act. As the matter of directing a re-poll by the Election 
Commission in the process of conducting the election has 
expressly been dealt with in the Elections Act, the Election 
Commission was not justified to invoke and exercise its 
general power under Article 218(3) read with Section 8(c) 
of the Elections Act in the present matter.” 
 
10. The distilled essence of the observations reproduced 
above is that the Supreme Court was of the clear opinion 
that exercise of powers by ECP both under Article 218 of 
the Constitution as well as section 8 of the 2017 Act could 
be done at any stage of the election process but not after its 
completion.  The completion of election process, in turn, 
would be the issuance of notification regarding returned 

W.P No.16416 of 2024 
 
7
candidates in the official gazette under Section 98 of the 
2017 Act when the election process would be deemed to 
have been completed.  This is also mentioned in paragraph 
20 of the Supreme Court’s judgment.  In a nub, ECP would 
become functus officio in all such matters after which the 
issues can only be raised through an election petition before 
the Election Tribunal.  This rule not only applies to ECP but 
also to this Court while exercising its constitutional 
jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution.  
Significant observations have been made by Supreme Court 
of Pakistan in Zulfiqar Ali Bhatti regarding interpretation of 
the words “save as otherwise provided”.  It will be noted 
that section 8 starts with these words which evidently mean 
that if there is anything specifically provided in the statute 
itself, the Commission will constrain itself and not exercise 
jurisdiction in respect of such matters under the cloak of 
section 8 and the powers conferred thereby.  Doubtless, ECP 
misdirected itself in law by relying upon section 8 of 2017 
Act in this case which fed through the rest of the decision-
making process. 
11. Section 95 of the 2017 Act is relevant for our purposes 
to critically interrogate the issue that the 2017 Act contains 
specific provisions regarding conferment of powers on ECP 
directing the Returning Officer to recount the ballot papers.  
Section 95 provides that: 
“95. Consolidation of results.—(1) Immediately after 
announcement of provisional results, the Returning Officer 
shall give the contesting candidates and their election 
agents a notice in writing of the day, time and place fixed 
for the consolidation of the results, and, in the presence of 
such of the contesting candidates and election agents as 
may be present, consolidate in the prescribed manner the 
Results of the Count furnished by the Presiding Officers, 

W.P No.16416 of 2024 
 
8
including therein the postal ballots received by him before 
the time fixed for the consolidation of results: 
Provided that presence of not more than one agent of each 
candidate shall be allowed. 
 
(2) Before consolidating the Results of the Count, the 
Returning Officer shall examine the ballot papers excluded 
from the count by the Presiding Officer and, if he finds that 
any such ballot paper should not have been so excluded, 
count it as a ballot paper cast in favour of the contesting 
candidate for whom the vote has been cast. 
 
(3) The Returning Officer shall also count the ballot papers 
received by him by post in such manner as may be 
prescribed and include the votes cast in favour of each 
contesting candidate in the Consolidated Statement except 
those which he may reject on any of the grounds mentioned 
in section 90. 
 
(4) The ballot papers rejected by the Returning Officer 
under subsection (3) shall be mentioned separately in the 
consolidated statement. 
 
(5) Before commencement of the proceedings, the 
Returning Officer shall recount the ballot papers of one or 
more polling stations if a request or challenge in writing is 
made to that effect by a contesting candidate or his 
election agent and— 
(a) the margin of victory between returned and 
runner up candidates is less than five percent of the 
total votes polled in the constituency or eight 
thousand votes in case of National Assembly 
constituency and four thousand votes in case of a 
Provincial Assembly constituency, as the case may 
be, whichever is less; or 
 
(b) the number of votes excluded from the count by 
the Presiding Officer are equal to or more than the 
margin of victory: 
 
Provided that the Returning Officer shall recount only once. 
 
(6) The Commission may, before conclusion of the 
consolidation proceedings and after notice to the 
contesting candidates], for reasons to be recorded, direct 
the Returning Officer to recount the ballot papers of one 
or more polling stations. 
 
(7) If there is a difference between the Results of the Count 
received from the Presiding Officers and the results of the 
recount, the Returning Officer shall record the difference 
and details thereof: 
 
Provided that where the Returning Officer has recounted 
the votes under sub-section (5) or sub-section (6), the 
consolidation proceedings shall be completed within— 
 
(a) seven days after the polling day in the case of 
elections to the National Assembly; and 
 
(b) five days after the polling day in the case of 
elections to a Provincial Assembly. 
 

W.P No.16416 of 2024

(8) The Returning Officer shall, within twenty four hours 
after 
the 
consolidation 
proceedings, 
send 
to 
the 
Commission signed copies of the Consolidated Statement of 
the Results of the Count and Final Consolidated Result 
together with Results of the Count and the Ballot Paper 
Account, as received from the Presiding Officers, and shall 
retain copies of these documents for record. 
 
(9) After consolidation of results, the Returning Officer 
shall give to such contesting candidates and their election 
agents 3 [and accredited observers] as are present during 
the consolidation proceedings a copy of the Consolidated 
Statement of the Results of the Count and the Final 
Consolidated Result sent to the Commission against proper 
receipt. 
 
(10) On receipt of documents under sub-section (8), the 
Commission shall, within fourteen days from the date of 
the poll, publish the documents on its website. 
 
12. Section 95 relates to consolidation of results and 
confers powers on the Returning Officer to do so 
immediately after announcement of provisional results.  
While doing so and before commencement of consolidation 
proceedings sub-section (5) confers upon the Returning 
Officer the power to order recount of ballot papers of one or 
more polling stations if a request or challenge in writing is 
made to that effect by a contesting candidate.  This is the 
power which was exercised by the Returning Officer while 
passing the order dated 10.02.2024.  Sub-section (6) is 
crucial in the present context and confers a power on ECP to 
direct the Returning Officer to recount the ballot papers 
before conclusion of consolidation proceedings.  The 
intention, in my opinion, is clear and unequivocal.  Firstly, a 
specific provision exists in the 2017 Act conferring powers 
on ECP to order the recount of ballot papers.  Second and 
more importantly it has to be done before conclusion of the 
consolidation proceedings.  If this power is not exercised by 
ECP within the contours mentioned in sub-section (6) of 
section 95, it cannot thereafter proceed to exercise such 

W.P No.16416 of 2024 
 
10
power on the misplaced notion that it can do so by invoking 
provisions of section 8 of the 2017 Act.  In such matters, 
therefore, ECP is constrained by section 95(6) and cannot 
exceed the jurisdiction so conferred.  In the impugned order, 
although ECP refers to the provisions of section 95(5) but 
ignored sub-section (6) of section 95 which relates to the 
powers of ECP.  ECP went wrong and committed an error 
by stating in paragraph 14 of the impugned order that 
notwithstanding the provisions of section 95 (6) of the 2017 
Act, the Commission may exercise “its inherent power to 
rectify any injustice committed during course of election”.  
This view is a violation of law and must be discountenanced.  
It cannot be sustained in view of the holding of the superior 
courts in different cases. It was unfortunate, in my opinion, 
for ECP while passing the impugned order to ignore the 
judgments of the superior courts in this regard and in 
particular the judgment by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
Zulfiqar Ali Bhatti. 
13. Two salutary principles of construction would be 
engaged at this juncture.  The first is that the policy of a law 
has to be kept in view in making any decision by authorities 
entrusted with statutory discretions.  This would include 
taking into account considerations of public policy.  In the 
case of 2017 Act, the policy of law is to empower ECP “to 
ensure that the election is conducted honestly, justly, fairly 
and in accordance with law, and that corrupt practices are 
guarded against.”  (Article 218(3) of the Constitution).  This 
is the theme at the heart of the 2017 Act and permeates 
through its length and breadth.  But ECP is not the only 
authority tasked with duties and obligations under 2017 Act.  

W.P No.16416 of 2024 
 
11
There are others, too.  Therefore, ECP must stay its hands 
after certain events have taken place and give way to other 
bodies to take charge.  The lofty and legitimate aim of 
holding just and fair elections cannot be taken to confer a 
carte blanche on ECP to expand its powers beyond the 
statutory realm.  A reading of the impugned order passed by 
the bench of ECP betrays an increased appetite for 
accumulating power which runs afoul of the intent of the 
law.  In doing so, ECP ignored the holding in Zulfiqar Ali 
Bhatti and a host of precedents handed down by superior 
courts in placing a construction on Article 218(3) of the 
Constitution as well as section 8 of the 2017 Act.  These 
precedents have enjoined a restrictive meaning to be given 
to these provisions so as to balance the place of ECP in the 
legislative architecture.  Recently, this Court while deciding 
W.P No.30623 of 2019 Mian Tariq Mehmood v. Election 
Commission of Pakistan & others, had this to say regarding 
the precise sweep of Article 218(3): 
“13. In view of the above holding, for all intents, ECP is 
denuded of any inclination to broaden upon its powers and 
read into Article 218(3) such expanded powers which do 
not vest in it. This penchant for broadening of powers is 
anathema to rule of law and basic foundations of 
constitutional democracy. We live under a Constitution and 
all powers flow from it especially those that affect a 
citizen’s rights. They culminate in an act of authority 
affecting the legal balance sheet of certain individuals. We 
have laws which invest a person, or a body of persons, with 
authority to regulate the behavior of other persons. The 
repositories of such powers are authorized to impose rights 
and liabilities and to confer privileges and immunities on 
certain individuals. It is incredulous to note that ECP chose 
to exercise jurisdiction over subject-matter while none 
existed. The essence of any legal system lies in the 
limitations placed by it upon the exercise of power; no 
grant of power by Parliament can be totally unlimited. 
 
14. The decision of ECP in this case runs counter to the 
doctrine of jurisdictional facts. „If a certain state of facts 
has to exist before an inferior tribunal have jurisdiction, 
they can inquire into the facts in order to decide whether 
they have jurisdiction but cannot give themselves 
jurisdiction by a wrong decision upon them‟. (Per Lord 

W.P No.16416 of 2024 
 
12
Goddard C.J in R.V Fulham, Hammersmith and Kensington 
R.T., Exp. Zerek [1951]2K.B.1, at 6). 
 
 
The lines which discriminate jurisdictions are fine, 
but they are clear and distinct, and if they are once effaced, 
endless 
and 
inextricable 
confusion 
must 
be 
the 
consequence.‘ 
[Grahan 
v. 
Maingay 
(1793) 
Ridg.L.&S.20,72] 
 
15. That warning (quoted in Jurisdiction and Illegality by 
Amnon Rubinstein, 2007) given at the end of eighteenth 
century, is particularly apposite nowadays with the growth 
of new inferior jurisdictions. ECP‟s action is a classic case 
of want of jurisdiction having been taken beyond the sphere 
allotted to it by law. It is regarded as usurpation of power 
unwarranted by law. The bounden duty of ECP, under the 
constitution and law, to determine the jurisdictional facts at 
the commencement of the inquiry. If they do not exist, ECP 
must abstain and go no further. In this context it is 
important that such action must stem from a legal provision 
and which must be stated clearly in a notice issued to any 
person. A notice which does not mention the relevant 
statutory provision under which ECP purports to derive its 
powers is a nullity and a misdirection of law which then 
feeds through the rest of the decision-making process. ECP 
cannot add to its litany of powers at its whims. 
 
16. It is of fundamental importance to emphasis that 
jurisdiction lies at the foundation of all legal proceedings. If 
it is not present, the proceeding is void. In the classic words 
of Chief Justice John Marshall, ―we have no more right to 
decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is given, then to 
usurp that which is not given. The one or the other would be 
treason to the constitution. 
[Cohen v. Virginia (1821) 19US(16Wheat)264] 
 
Article 175, Clause (2) provides that: 
―175(2) No court shall have any jurisdiction save 
as is or may be conferred on it by the Constitution 
or by or under any law. 
 
17. The above mandate equally applies to executive 
authorities and high-powered tribunals such as ECP. In 
administrative law, jurisdiction merely means legal 
authority or power. (See, legal control of Government by 
Bernard Schwartz and H.W.R Wade, p.210). As Lord 
Denning said in R.v Chief Immigration Officer (1980)3 All 
ER 373, 379), ―No jurisdiction means no power.” 
 
14. In view of the above observations (which echo those 
made in Zulfiqar Ali Bhatti) the reliance of ECP on Article 
218 is inapt and disloyal to the language of Article 218 of 
the Constitution. 
15. The second rule, vouched by respectable authority, is 
that a statute has to be read as a whole and not in bits and 
pieces, divorced from one another.  Hence the significance 

W.P No.16416 of 2024 
 
13
of the words “save as otherwise provided” used in section 8.  
Thus, section 8 has to be read in conjunction with section 
95(6) of the 2017 Act.  The indubitable inference would be 
that in matters of recount of ballot papers, ECP can only act 
under Section 95(6) and that too before consolidation 
proceedings are concluded.  If that does not happen, ECP 
cannot use section 8 to circumvent the law to achieve 
indirectly what cannot be done directly. 
16. There are other compelling reasons which dictate that 
ECP must act within the periphery of its powers.  This is in 
the context of consolidation of results and the ultimate 
declaration of results by ECP.  Sub-section (7) of section 95 
requires that consolidation proceedings by the Returning 
Officer shall be completed within seven days after the 
polling day in case of elections to the National Assembly 
and by sub-section (10), ECP shall within fourteen days 
from the date of the poll publish the documents on its 
website.  Section 98 relates to declaration of results and 
provides that: 
98. Declaration of results.—(1) On receipt of the Final 
Consolidated Result from the Returning Officer, the 
Commission shall, within fourteen days from the date of the 
poll, publish in the official Gazette the name of the 
contesting candidate who has received the highest number 
of votes and stands elected. 
(2) The Commission shall also publish in the official 
Gazette the name of each contesting candidate and the total 
number of votes received by him as in the Final 
Consolidated Result. 
(3) Every returned candidate shall, within ten days from the 
poll of an election, submit a return of election expenses 
under section 134 and the Commission shall not notify in 
the official Gazette the result of a returned candidate who 
fails to submit his return of election expenses. 
(4) The Commission shall place the documents mentioned in 
sub sections (1) and (2) on its website within two days 
from the date of the publication of the name of the returned 
candidate in the official Gazette. 
 

W.P No.16416 of 2024

17. It is evident that on receipt of final consolidated results 
from the Returning Officer, the Commission shall, within 
fourteen days from the date of the poll, publish in the 
official gazette the name of the contesting candidate who has 
received the highest number of votes and stands elected.  
This was duly done by ECP in the instant case on 
16.02.2024.  Thus, ECP carried out its statutory duty under 
Section 98 of the 2017 Act by declaring the results within 
the stipulated period of fourteen days from the date of the 
poll.  These provisions are couched in mandatory language 
and must be complied with.  There is no quarrel that ECP 
fulfilled its duty in this regard and published the name of the 
petitioner in the official gazette.  The impugned order 
subsequently passed by ECP would be tantamount to review 
of its own declaration of results in the official gazette and 
this is an additional reason why ECP should not have 
exercised its jurisdiction in the present case after declaration 
of results by it.  Suffice to say that ECP does not have power 
of review.  This is precisely the reason why the Commission 
has been empowered to direct the Returning Officer to 
recount the ballot papers before conclusion of the 
consolidation proceedings.  The intention of the statute is 
that all such matters must be dealt with and decided prior to 
the declaration of results under Section 98 of 2017 Act. 
18. Learned counsel for respondent No.3 laid much stress 
on the report filed by the Returning Officer to ECP and a 
letter written to the Deputy Superintendent of Police which 
referred to commotion by a group of political workers who 
had gathered outside the office of the Returning Officer.  
Interestingly, ECP relied upon this report to conclude that: 

W.P No.16416 of 2024 
 
15
“9. 
As the local police failed to provide full security of 
R.O; in order to complete process of re-counting the 
concern R.O; bowed to the illegal pressure of political 
workers, who had gathered outside the venue of re-counting 
and to avoid further hardship rejected the application on 
the same day for grounds.” 
 
19. It could not be ascertained whether the political 
workers who had allegedly gathered outside the office of the 
Returning Officer belonged to the petitioner or supported 
respondent No.3.  Learned counsel for respondent No.3 
conceded that this was a factual inquiry and required 
investigation.  Be that as it may, nothing turns upon this 
aspect of the matter and what has to be seen by this Court is 
the legality or otherwise of the impugned order passed by 
ECP. 
20. Another factor needs to be flagged here.  The 
impugned order evinces meandering jurisprudence.  The 
exercise of jurisdiction under Article 218(3) of the 
Constitution and section 8 of the 2017 Act cannot be an 
open-textured concept. A cluster of orders passed 
contemporaneously by different benches of ECP (including 
by the same Member who authored the impugned order) 
clearly establishes a keen awareness of the limits of ECP’s 
powers and the mandate of law to require ECP to draw a line 
after a certain stage has come to pass.  Sadly the same 
consistency was lacking in the impugned order and ECP 
brushed under the carpet the line of decisions which marked 
a clear departure from the stance taken in the impugned 
order.   
21. For instance, an order was passed on 12.02.2024 in the 
case titled Shahzane Khan v. Returning Officer & other, an 
application under Section 95(6) of the 2017 Act.  The order 

W.P No.16416 of 2024 
 
16
was penned by Justice (R) Ikram Ullah Khan, Member who 
also authored the instant judgment and was pleased to hold 
that since Form 49 in terms of section 95 had already been 
issued by the Returning Officer “this Commission has no 
any such jurisdiction in view of section 95(6) to make any 
kind of such direction of re-counting therefore, the prayer of 
petitioner in this regard is regretted”.  Similarly, in an order 
passed on 20.02.2024 in the case of Shaheer Dawood Buttv. 
Returning Officer written by the Chairman ECP it was 
categorically held that the Returning Officer was the 
authority under Section 95 of 2017 Act to allow or disallow 
the recounting of votes.  Further since election tribunals had 
been appointed under Section 140 and election petitions are 
being filed under Section 139 of the 2017 Act, the prayer of 
the petitioner could not be granted.  More importantly, it 
was held by the Bench headed by the Chairman ECP that 
“moreover the office has also informed that the process of 
consolidation has been completed by the concerned 
Returning Officer and therefore the provisions of section 95 
(6) also do not attract in this case”.  That order went on to 
state that the notification of the returned candidate had been 
issued and on this ground too, the provisions of section 95 
(6) were not attracted. In another case decided on 
19.02.2024 by the same learned Member, that is, Justice (R) 
Ikram Ullah Khan, in the case of Sardarzada Mir Saeed 
Ahmed v. Returning Officer the learned Member once again 
alluded to the rule that the matter could not be reviewed 
under Section 8 of the 2017 Act which needed to be 
examined by the Election Tribunals appointed under Section 
140 of 2017 Act.  Additionally, it was held that since the 

W.P No.16416 of 2024 
 
17
process of consolidation had been completed, therefore, 
section 8 could not be invoked.  Finally, another order 
passed by the Chairman ECP has been relied upon dated 
20.02.2024 in the case of Amir Masood v. District Returning 
Officer and the same rule was reiterated by the Chairman of 
the Bench while relying upon the fact that since the Election 
Tribunals had been constituted, Article 225 of the 
Constitution clearly provided that no election could be 
called in question except by way of election petition.  It was 
further stated that since the process of consolidation had 
been completed by the concerned Returning Officer, 
therefore, the provisions of section 95(6) were not attracted. 
22. A review of the orders which have been referred above 
clearly shows that ECP and its benches exercising 
jurisdiction in the matter of adjudication are cognizant of the 
scope of its powers under Sections 8 and 95 of 2017 Act and 
have consistently held that these powers could not be 
invoked once consolidation of result had taken place and 
notification regarding a returned candidate had been issued.  
Also ECP has refused to exercise its jurisdiction in all such 
election disputes where Election Tribunals have been 
notified which is the case in the instant matter too.  It is 
incredulous indeed that ECP, contrary to its stance in a 
number of cases, has proceeded to exercise its jurisdiction in 
the instant matter without adverting to any of the grounds 
which found favour with the bench in similar cases.  The 
obligation cast upon ECP under Article 218(3) of the 
Constitution to ensure free and fair election should start with 
the primary responsibility to make consistent decisions 

W.P No.16416 of 2024 
 
18
based on the principles of rule of law and by following the 
basic tenet that every power has legal limits. 
23. Before I tear away myself, it may be stated that the 
judgments passed by the superior courts are binding on the 
benches of ECP while adjudicating different complaints 
which come before those benches.  Those judgments have 
clearly laid down the limits of powers of ECP and in the 
instant case unfortunately the bench of ECP did not advert 
its attention to those judgments and, therefore, failed in its 
constitutional duty.  Not only that and as adumbrated, it did 
not even consider its own views expressed in various orders 
during the same period. 
24. The case law cited by learned counsel for respondent 
No.3 is not relevant for decision of the controversy in hand 
and need not be discussed in detail. 
25. In sum, the impugned order is without lawful authority 
and of no legal effect.  It is set aside.  Consequently, the 
petition is allowed.  The notification dated 18.03.2024 
issued by ECP notifying the name of respondent No.3 as the 
returned candidate is also struck down.
