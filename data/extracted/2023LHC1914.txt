who used to work at Lahore. After dropping my son Muhammad Nadeem 
we went to AwanPura in the house of my said daughter at about 10:15 PM 
but her house was locked. Accused Abdul Jabbar had a Karyana shop, we 
went to the said shop, the shutter of the shop was down but electric bulb was 
on. We opened the shutter and saw that rope was present on neck of accused 
Jabbar and he was lying on the ground in unconscious position. We made 
hue and cry whereupon inhabitants of the village came there. We saw that 
my daughter Bushra Bibi was lying in dead condition, she was soaked in 
blood lying on a cot while her throat was cut and nearby a blood stained 
'Churri' was lying. Accused Abdul Jababr (sic) committed murder of my 
daughter because he was suspecting that she was having illicit relations with 
someone else. The accused also attempted to committed suicide himself.

7. 
On 12.04.2022, the learned Assistant District Public Prosecutor   gave up 
the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Mujahid, Muhammad Aamir and 
Uzair Farrukh 76/C as being unnecessary and closed the prosecution evidence 
after tendering the reports of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PS, 
Exh.PT and Exh.PU).  
 
8. 
After the closure of prosecution evidence, the learned trial court examined 
appellant namely Abdul Jabbar son of Jan Muhammad under section 342 Cr.P.C.

deposed against you, he replied that he was innocent and had been falsely 
involved in the case. He further stated that he had not committed the occurrence 
and had been made a scapegoat in the case in order to show efficiency by the 
police. The appellant namely Abdul Jabbar son of Jan Muhammad opted not to

get himself examined under section 340(2) Cr.P.C , however, got Maryam Jabbar 
(DW-1) examined  in his defence.  
 
9. 
On the conclusion of the trial, the learned Additional Sessions Judge, 
Chishtian convicted and sentenced the appellant as referred to above.  
 
10. 
The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant precisely is that the 
whole case is fabricated and false. The learned counsel for the appellant 
submitted that the prosecution remained unable to prove the facts in issue and did 
not produce any unimpeachable, admissible and relevant evidence. The learned 
counsel for the appellant further contended that the statements of prosecution 
witnesses were not worthy of any reliance. The learned counsel for the appellant 
also argued that the recoveries were full of procedural defects, of no legal worth 
and value and result of fake proceedings. The learned counsel for the appellant 
finally submitted that the prosecution had totally failed to prove the case against 
the appellant beyond the shadow of doubt.   
11. 
 On the other hand, the learned Deputy Prosecutor General along with the 
learned counsel for the complainant contended that the prosecution has proved its 
case beyond the shadow of a doubt by producing independent witnesses. The 
learned Deputy Prosecutor General along with the learned counsel for the 
complainant further argued that the deceased died as a result of injuries suffered 
at the hands of the appellant. The learned Deputy Prosecutor General along with 
the learned counsel for the complainant further contended that the medical 
evidence also supported the facts in issue. The learned Deputy Prosecutor General 

Murder Reference No.14 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 351-J of 2022 
10 
 
along with the learned counsel for the complainant further argued that the 
recovery of the Churri (P-1) and the reports of the Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore also provided support to the prosecution case. The learned 
Deputy Prosecutor General along with the learned counsel for the complainant 
contended that there was no occasion for the prosecution witnesses, who were 
related to the deceased, to substitute the real offender with the innocent in this 
case. Lastly, they prayed for the rejection of the appeal. 
12. 
We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant, the learned counsel 
for the complainant, the learned Deputy Prosecutor General and with their 
assistance carefully perused the record and evidence recorded during the trial. 
 
13. 
After consideration of the contentions raised by learned counsel for the 
respective parties and scanning the evidence, it is pertinent to mention here that 
in the instant matter, ocular evidence is not available. There can be no dispute 
regarding the fact that the case is built on circumstantial evidence. In dealing with 
circumstantial evidence, the rules especially applicable to such evidence must be 
borne in mind. In such cases, there is always the danger that conjecture or 
suspicion may take the place of legal proof and therefore, it is right to recall the 
warning addressed by Baron Alderson to the jury in Reg. V. Hodge, (1938) 2 
Lewin 227) where he said:  
“The mind was apt to take a pleasure in adapting circumstances 
to one another, and even in straining them a little, if need be, to 
force them to form parts of one connected whole; and the more 
ingenious the mind of the individual, the more likely was it, 

Murder Reference No.14 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 351-J of 2022 
11 
 
considering such matters, to overreach and mislead itself, to 
supply some little link that is wanting , to take for granted some 
fact consistent with its previous theories and necessary to render 
them complete.” 
 Sir Alfred Wills in his book “An Essay on the Principles of Circumstantial 
Evidence” (pages 173 to 190 of the Fifth American, from the Fourth London 
Edition published in 1872) lays down the following rules specially to be observed 
in the case of circumstantial evidence:  
“RULE 1.   The facts  alleged as the basis of any legal inference must be 
clearly proved, and indubitably connected with the factum probandum. 
RULE   2. The burden of proof is always on the party who asserts the 
existence of any fact which infers legal accountability 
RULE 3.    In  all cases, whether of  direct or  circumstantial evidence, 
the best evidence must be  adduced which the nature of  the case admits  
RULE 4.-  In order to justify the inference of guilt the inculpatory facts 
must be   incompatible with the innocence of   the accused, and incapable 
of explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt. 
RULE 5.    If   there be any reasonable doubt of   the guilt of   the accused, 
he  is  entitled, as  of right, to  be   acquitted.” 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in its binding judgment titled “Naveed 
Asghar and two others Vs. The State” (P L D 2021 Supreme Court 600) has 
enunciated the following principle of law for the appreciation of circumstantial 
evidence:  
          “Approach to determine sufficiency of circumstantial evidence 

Murder Reference No.14 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 351-J of 2022 
12 
 
14. The settled approach to deal with the question as to sufficiency of 
circumstantial evidence for conviction of the accused person is this: If, 
on the facts and circumstances proved, no hypothesis consistent with the 
innocence of the accused person can be suggested, the case is fit for 
conviction of the accused person on such conclusion; however, if such 
facts and circumstances can be reconciled with any reasonable 
hypothesis compatible with the innocence of the appellant, the case is to 
be treated one of insufficient evidence, resulting in acquittal of the 
accused person. Circumstantial evidence, in a murder case, should be 
like a well-knit chain, one end of which touches the dead body of the 
deceased and the other the neck of the accused. No link in chain of the 
circumstances should be broken and the circumstances should be such 
as cannot be explained away on any reasonable hypothesis other than 
guilt of accused person. Chain of such facts and circumstances has to 
be completed to establish guilt of the accused person beyond reasonable 
doubt and to make the plea of his being innocent incompatible with the 
weight of evidence against him. Any link missing from the chain breaks 
the whole chain and renders the same unreliable; in that event, 
conviction cannot be safely recorded, especially on a capital charge. 
Therefore, if the circumstantial evidence is found not of the said 
standard and quality, it will be highly unsafe to rely upon the same for 
conviction; rather, not to rely upon such evidence will a better and a 
safer course.” 
 
Thus, in a case of circumstantial evidence, the prosecution must establish each 
instance of incriminating circumstance by way of reliable and clinching evidence, 
and the circumstances so proved must form a complete chain of events, on the 
basis of which no conclusion other than one of guilt of the accused can be 
reached. Undoubtedly, suspicion, however grave it may be, can never be treated 
as a substitute for proof. From the evidence of the prosecution available on record, 
it is clear that the case of the prosecution hinges upon the statements of the 
prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-1) and Rasheed Ahmad 
(PW-2), who stated that they discovered the dead body of the deceased inside the 
shop of the appellant and also found the appellant to be present in an unconscious 
condition in the same shop, making them perceive that the appellant had 
murdered the deceased, the evidence of the presence of the dead body of the 
deceased inside the shop of the appellant , the recovery of the Churri (P-1) from 

Murder Reference No.14 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 351-J of 2022 
13 
 
the place of occurrence, the blood stained  Shalwar and Qameez of the appellant 
and the report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PU).  
14.        According to the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-
1) and Rasheed Ahmad (PW-2),  it was on 27.05.2021 at about 10.15 p.m, when 
they proceeded to inquire about the deceased and arrived at the shop of the 
appellant where they found the shutter door of the shop downed, however, the 
electric light bulb being on, so they went inside the shop and discovered the dead 
body of the deceased inside the shop of the appellant and also found the appellant 
to be present in an unconscious condition in the same shop, convincing them that 
the appellant had murdered the deceased. A perusal of the statements of the 
prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-1) and Rasheed Ahmad 
(PW-2) proves that both the witnesses failed to establish that they were the first 
to arrive at the place of occurrence and the first to discover the presence of the 
dead body of the deceased inside the shop of the appellant and the first to find the 
appellant to be present in an unconscious condition in the same shop. Both the 
prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-1) and Rasheed Ahmad 
(PW-2) admitted that the shop of the appellant, where the dead body was found 
present, was in Basti Awan Pura, whereas the prosecution witness namely 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-1) was resident of Mauza Mehr Shareef, whereas the 
prosecution witness namely Rasheed Ahmad (PW-2) was the resident of Tibbi 
Tanki, Tehsil Chishtian. Both the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad 
Ashraf (PW-1) and Rasheed Ahmad (PW-2) also admitted that Basti Awan Pura 
was at a distance from their residences. The prosecution witness namely 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-1) admitted during cross-examination , as under:- 

Murder Reference No.14 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 351-J of 2022 
14 
 
“Mahar Sharif is at a distance of about five kilometers from Basti 
Awanpura. It is incorrect to suggest that the above said distance is about 14/15 
kilometers. The distance between Basti AwanPura and Basti Tibba Tainki 
is about 1/1/2 kilometer.  
…….. 
PW Muhammad Rasheed is husband of sister of my wife. ” (emphasis 
supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Rasheed Ahmad (PW-2) admitted during cross-
examination , as under:- 
“The distance between AwanPura and Mahar Sharif is three kilometers. It 
is incorrect to suggest that the above mentioned distance is about 14/15 
kilometer. The distance between Awanpur and Tibba Tainki is about one 
kilometer.  
………. 
 Complainant Muhammad Ashraf is husband of my sister in law. ” 
As both the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-1) and 
Rasheed Ahmad (PW-2) were not the residents of Basti Awan Pura, therefore, 
being conscious of this fact that  there did not exist any reason for them to had 
proceeded to the place of the recovery of the dead body , the prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-1) and Rasheed Ahmad (PW-2) came 
up with a reason that as they had to board Muhammad Nadeem (PW-4) on a bus 
for Lahore, therefore, on 27.05.2021, they accompanied Muhammad Nadeem 
(PW-4) to the Bus stop and returning from the same went to the matrimonial 

Murder Reference No.14 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 351-J of 2022 
15 
 
house of the deceased to inquire about her. The prosecution witness namely 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-1), in his examination in-chief ,stated as under:- 
“On 27.5.2021 I alongwith Rasheed Ahmad and Mujahid came to Chishtian 
Lari Adda in order to drop my son namely Muhammad Nadeem, who used to 
work at Lahore. After dropping my son Muhammad Nadeem we went to 
AwanPura in the house of my said daughter at about 10:15 PM but her house 
was locked. ” 
The prosecution witness namely Rasheed Ahmad (PW-2), in his examination in-
chief recorded by the learned trial court , stated as under:- 
“Stated on 27.5.2021 I alongwith complainant Muhammad Ashraf and Mujahid 
came to Chishtian Lari Adda in order to drop Muhammad Nadeem son of 
complainant, who used to work at Lahore. After dropping Muhammad Nadeem 
we went to AwanPur in the house of complainant's daughter Bushra Bibi (now 
deceased) at about 10:15 PM, but her house was locked. ” 
 Incidentally the prosecution also got Muhammad Nadeem (PW-4) examined, 
however, Muhammad Nadeem (PW-4) did not state that on 27.05.2021, the 
prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-1) and Rasheed Ahmad 
(PW-2) had accompanied him to the bus stop when he was to proceed to Lahore.  
In his statement before the learned trial court, Muhammad Nadeem (PW-4) stated 
as under:- 
“Stated that I am resident of Mahar Sharif and labourer by profession. On 
28.5.2021, I received dead body of deceased Mst. Bushra Bibi my sister after 
autopsy for her funeral ceremony and burial through receipt Exh.PG. 1.0 
recorded my statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C in this regard on the same day. 
XXX Cross examination by learned counsel for the accused. 

Murder Reference No.14 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 351-J of 2022 
16 
 
 
I reached at Lari Adda on 27.5.2021 at about 10:00 PM. I had boarded the bus 
for Lahore, when I reached at Bahawalnagar at about 10:45 PM, then I received 
information of occurrence and as such I returned back to place of occurrence. ” 
The above referred portions of the statements of the prosecution witnesses 
namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-1) , Rasheed Ahmad (PW-2) and Muhammad 
Nadeem (PW-4) fully denude the false claim of the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-1) and Rasheed Ahmad (PW-2) that as they had to board 
Muhammad Nadeem (PW-4) on a bus for Lahore, therefore, on 27.05.2021, they 
had accompanied Muhammad Nadeem (PW-4) to the Bus stop and returning 
from the same went to the matrimonial house of the deceased to inquire about 
her. The very reason for which the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad 
Ashraf (PW-1) and Rasheed Ahmad (PW-2) claimed to had left their residences 
was denied by their own witness namely Muhammad Nadeem (PW-4). We have 
also noted that the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-1) and 
Rasheed Ahmad (PW-2) claimed that they had gone on a motorcycle to drop 
Muhammad Nadeem (PW-4) at the bus stop in Chishtian, however admitted that 
the said motorcycle under their use was never produced before the Investigating 
Officer of the case . Muhammad Ashraf (PW-1) , during cross-examination , 
admitted as under:- 
“We left Muhammad Nadeem at Larri Ada through motorcycle, but the said 
motorcycle was not produced before the I.0 ” 
In this manner, the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-1) and 
Rasheed Ahmad (PW-2) could not even prove that on 27.05.2021, they 

Murder Reference No.14 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 351-J of 2022 
17 
 
accompanied Muhammad Nadeem (PW-4) to the Bus stop and while returning 
from the same went to the matrimonial house of the deceased to inquire about her 
and finding the same to be locked, arrived at the shop of the appellant where they 
found the shutter door of the shop downed, however, electric light bulb being on, 
so they went inside the shop and discovered the dead body of the deceased inside 
the shop of the appellant and also found the appellant to be present in an 
unconscious condition in the same shop. 
15. 
We have also noted that the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad 
Ashraf (PW-1) and Rasheed Ahmad (PW-2) also make absolutely incorrect 
statements with regard to the details of the events which took place subsequent 
to the discovery of the dead body as well as the appellant inside the shop of the 
appellant. Both the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-1) 
and Rasheed Ahmad (PW-2)  claimed that they reached at the THQ hospital 
Chishtian at about 08.30 a.m on 28.05.2021 along with the dead body of the 
deceased as well as the Investigating Officer of the case and till their arrival at 
the hospital, they remained present in Basti Awan Pura. The prosecution witness 
namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-1) , during cross-examination , admitted as 
under:- 
“ We reached at THQ Hospital Chishtian at about 08:30 AM and at that time 
I was accompanying Rasheed, Mujahid, Imran and Zafar. The dead body was 
received by Muhammad Nadeem my son. Prior to reaching at THQ Hospital 
Chishtian we remained at Basti Awanpura.” (emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Rasheed Ahmad (PW-2), during cross 
examination , admitted as under:- 

Murder Reference No.14 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 351-J of 2022 
18 
 
“We reached at THQ Hospital Chishtian at about 10:00 AM and at that time 
I was accompanying Ashraf, Mujahid, Muhammad Nadeem, Zafar Iqbal 
Muhammad Amir and Saquib Hussain ASI. We proceeded to THQ Hospital 
Chishtian from Basti Awan Pura. ” (emphasis supplied)  
Contradicting the statements of prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad 
Ashraf (PW-1) and Rasheed Ahmad (PW-2) , the Investigating Officer of the case 
namely Saqib Hussain Wajid, SI (PW-12) stated that  the dead body of the 
deceased arrived at the THQ hospital Chishtian on 28.05.2021 at 12.00 a.m 
(night). Saqib Hussain Wajid, SI (PW-12), during cross-examination stated as 
under:- 
“ The dead body reached at THQ Hospital Chishtian on 28.5.2021 after 12:00 
(night).” 
Even Dr.Iram Zafar (PW-9) stated that the dead body of the deceased was 
received at the hospital on 28.05.2021, at 05.30 a.m. and she conducted the post 
mortem examination of the deceased on the same day at 06.15 a.m.  No other 
witness supported the statements of the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-1) and Rasheed Ahmad (PW-2)  that they had arrived at 
the THQ hospital along with the Investigating Officer of the case and the dead 
body of the deceased at 08.30 a.m {as stated by Muhammad Ashraf (PW-1)} or 
10.00 a.m  {as stated by Rasheed Ahmad (PW-2)} on 28.05.2021. 
16.    It is also a fact that at the time of conducting the post mortem examination 
of the dead body of the deceased, Dr.Iram Zafar (PW-9) noted that the eyes and 
mouth of the deceased were open and observed as under:- 

Murder Reference No.14 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 351-J of 2022 
19 
 
“A dead body of middle aged healthy female lying supine on mortuary table 
with eyes and mouth open, ” (emphasis supplied)  
Dr.Iram Zafar (PW-9) , during cross-examination , also stated as under:- 
“It is correct that eyes and mouth of the deceased were open at the time of 
examination ” 
The stance set up by the prosecution in the present case is that the prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-1) and Rasheed Ahmad (PW-2)   had 
discovered the dead body of the deceased and had remained with the dead body. 
The mouth and eyes of the deceased were found open at the time of post mortem 
examination by Dr.Iram Zafar (PW-9), thus, if the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-1) and Rasheed Ahmad (PW-2)  were present then, at 
least after the death, as is a consistent practice of such close relatives, they would 
have closed the eyes and mouth of the deceased on her expiry. Thus, the open 
eyes and mouth of the deceased force a hostile interpretation against the 
prosecution's version regarding the presence of the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-1) and Rasheed Ahmad (PW-2) at the place of 
occurrence where the dead body was allegedly discovered by them . The august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “MUHAMMAD RAFIQUE alias 
FEEQA vs. The State”(2019 SCMR 1068) has held as under: 
“What has further irked this Court is that in column No. 9 of the Marg Report 
(Ex.PW9/1), and even in the Post Mortem Report (Ex.PW-10/A), the mouth of 
the deceased has been stated to be open, which clearly indicates that the dead 
body was not attended to by his close relatives after being pronounced dead. 
However, the stance set up by the prosecution in the present case is that Arshad 
Ali - the brother, and Nazir Ahmad - the uncle of the deceased Muhammad Azam 
were present at the time of his death, and remained with him, even thereafter. 
Thus, the said posture of the deceased raises an adverse inference against the 

Murder Reference No.14 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 351-J of 2022 
20 
 
prosecution's version regarding the presence of the said persons at the place 
and time of occurrence.” 
17. 
Another factor proving the absence of the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-1) and Rasheed Ahmad (PW-2) at the place of the 
discovery of the dead body of the deceased was the delay in the post mortem 
examination of the dead body. According to the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-1) and Rasheed Ahmad (PW-2) they had discovered the 
dead body at about 10.15 p.m on 27.05.2021, the oral statement (Exh.PA) of  the 
prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-1) was recorded at the place 
of recovery of the dead body by Saqib Hussain Wajid, SI (PW-12) , the 
Investigating Officer of the case on 27.05.2021 at 11.55 p.m but the post mortem 
examination of the dead body was conducted by Dr.Iram Zafar (PW-9) on 
28.05.2021 at 06.15 a.m. Dr.Iram Zafar (PW-9) also noted fully developed rigor 
mortis at the time of conducting the post-mortem examination of the dead body 
of the deceased. Additionally, as mentioned above, according to the statement of 
Saqib Hussain Wajid, SI (PW-12) , the Investigating Officer of the case , the dead 
body had been sent to the hospital as early as at about 12.00 a.m. (night). When 
the dead body had arrived at the hospital as early as at about 12.00 a.m. (night) 
then there did not exist any reason for delay in conducting the post mortem 
examination of the dead body of the deceased except the reason which is apparent 
that by that time the details of the occurrence were not known and the said time 
was used to not only to procure the attendance of the witnesses but also to fashion 
a false narrative of the oral statement (Exh.PA). No explanation was offered to 
justify the said delay in conducting the post mortem examination. This clearly 
establishes that the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-1) and 

Murder Reference No.14 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 351-J of 2022 
21 
 
Rasheed Ahmad (PW-2) , claiming to have discovered the dead body , were not 
present at the place of the recovery of the dead body  and the delay in the post 
mortem examination was used to procure their attendance and formulate a false 
narrative, after consultation and concert. It has been repeatedly held by the august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan that such delay in the post mortem examination is 
reflective of the absence of witnesses and the sole purpose of causing such delay 
is to procure the presence of witnesses and to further advance a false narrative to 
involve any person. Reliance in this regard is placed on the case of “Khalid alias 
Khalidi and two others vs. The State” (2012 SCMR 327) ,the case of “Mian 
SOHAIL AHMED and others vs. The State and others” (2019 SCMR 956) and 
the case of “MUHAMMAD RAFIQUE alias FEEQA vs. The State” (2019 SCMR 
1068) .All the facts mentioned above prove that the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-1) and Rasheed Ahmad (PW-2) could not prove that the 
appellant had murdered the deceased was a fact, which they, the prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-1) and Rasheed Ahmad (PW-2) ,  
could have perceived by any sense. 
 
18. 
The learned Deputy Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the 
complainant have laid great stress upon the fact that the appellant was present, in 
an unconscious condition, inside the same shop where the dead body of the 
deceased was also present, therefore, this circumstance prove the guilt of the 
appellant. The fact that the appellant was lying unconscious at the scene of 
occurrence is accepted by all the prosecution witnesses including the 
Investigating Officer, who sent the appellant to the THQ hospital Chishtian for 

Murder Reference No.14 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 351-J of 2022 
22 
 
medical attention. Since he was sent by the Investigating Officer himself, the 
prosecution ought to have placed on record the material indicating what made 
him unconscious, what was the probable period of such unconsciousness and 
whether the appellant was falsely projecting it. The prosecution got Dr. Waleed 
Bin Tariq (PW-11) examined who stated that on 27.05.2021, he was posted at 
THQ hospital Chishtian and at about 11.55 p.m had examined the appellant as an 
emergency case. The prosecution also got Dr. Syed Muhammad Shoaib Akhtar 
(PW-8) examined, who on 28.05.2021 was posted at THQ hospital Chishtian and 
had examined the appellant on the same day. On examining the appellant, Dr. 
Syed Muhammad Shoaib Akhtar (PW-8) observed a bruise, horizontal in 
position, present in front of the neck, 5 cm below the chin of the appellant and 
the appellant was referred to BV. Hospital Bahawalpur for further management. 
The prosecution also got Dr. Hafiz Aamir Bashir  (PW-14) examined who stated 
that on 28.05.2021, he was posted as Medical Officer at BV hospital Bahawalpur 
and on the same day examined the appellant and observed  that the appellant was 
received  at the hospital with the history of strangulation from ceiling fan and had 
strangulation marks extending from one sternomastoid muscle to  the other, 
present on the anterior aspect of the neck. No effort was made by the Investigating 
Officer of the case to determine as to since when the appellant was unconscious 
when he was discovered by the Investigating Officer of the case and subsequently 
sent to the hospital for examination. The prosecution case is also silent as to the 
ligature used for strangulating the appellant. Only the rope (P-2) was taken into 
possession by the Crime Scene Unit, however, it was not declared that the same 
was present around the neck of the appellant and had been removed from the 
same by the Investigating Officer of the case or the Crime Scene Unit or by any 

Murder Reference No.14 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 351-J of 2022 
23 
 
Medical Officer who had examined the appellant. According to the exhibit sheet 
(Exh.PP), the rope (P-2) was tied around the iron girder near the ceiling fan 
present at the place of occurrence. Moreover, most importantly, according to the 
report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PU), the DNA profile of 
the deceased was found present on the rope (P-2) but no DNA of the appellant 
was found present on the rope (P-2). Had the appellant touched the rope (P-2) , 
as was suggested by the prosecution witnesses that the appellant had attempted 
to commit suicide by hanging himself from the girder using the rope (P-2), then  
the DNA of the appellant must have been discovered on the rope (P-2), however, 
it was not. The relevant portion of the report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, 
Lahore (Exh.PU) reads as under:- 
“ 7.    A rope tied with girder near ceiling fan at crime scene. 
7.1    Swab(s) taken from the knot-area of rope.  
7.2    Swab(s) taken from other than knot area of rope 
……………….. 
The DNA profile obtained from item #7.2 is a mixture of at least two individuals 
with major and minor components. The major component of the DNA profile 
obtained from this item is consistent with the DNA profile of Bushra Bibi 
item #4). The probability of finding an unrelated individual at random in the 
population as being a major contributor to the DNA obtained from this item is 
approximately one in 9 quintillion in Caucasians. The minor component of the 
DNA profile obtained from this item is partial and inconclusive 
The DNA profile obtained from item #7.1 is partial and inconclusive.”

When an individual touches an object, epithelial cells are left behind. Touch DNA 
is also known as epithelial DNA. The same traditional DNA analysis procedures 
are used to analyze and examine these remaining epithelial cells as are used to 
analyze and examine bodily fluids. The amount left behind is often less than 100 
picograms and is also called low copy DNA. This is evidence with “no visible 
staining that would likely contain DNA resulting from the transfer of epithelial 
cells from the skin to an object. Due to development, lower amounts of human 
DNA can be detected and, possibly, a full or partial STR profile can be generated. 
DNA evidence has emerged as a powerful tool to identify perpetrators of 
unspeakable crimes and to exonerate innocent individuals accused of similarly 
heinous actions. The report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore 
(Exh.PU) conclusively proves that the appellant had not handled the rope (P-2). 
Furthermore, the fact that the appellant was lying unconscious and no material 
having been placed on record clearly indicating that the appellant was falsely 
projecting to be unconscious, the hypothesis that the appellant could be innocent 
is a possibility. 
 
19. 
The prosecution also made no effort to prove the exact time when the 
occurrence took place. The only evidence produced by the prosecution to prove 
the time of occurrence was the evidence of Dr.Iram Zafar (PW-9), who on 
28.05.2021 was posted as Woman Medical Officer at the THQ hospital Chishtian 
and on the same day had conducted the postmortem examination of the dead body 
of Mst. Bushra Bibi daughter of Muhammad Ashraf   (deceased). Dr.Iram Zafar 
(PW-9) explained that in the instant case,  she conducted the post mortem 

Murder Reference No.14 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 351-J of 2022 
25 
 
examination on 28.05.2021 at 06.15 a.m.  and noted fully developed rigor mortis 
at the time of conducting the post-mortem examination of the dead body of the 
deceased. Dr.Iram Zafar (PW-9) also opined that according to her estimation, the 
time between death and post mortem examination was within 24 hours . Dr.Iram 
Zafar (PW-9), during her statement before the learned trial court, stated as under:- 
“Probable time that lapsed between injury and death immediately and between 
death and postmortem within 24 hours. 
…………….. 
Rigor mortis were fully developed. Usually within 6 to 8 hours rigor mortis are 
fully developed on a dead body. It is correct that rigor mortis develops early in 
cold season. The duration of developing of rigor mortis varies. Rigor mortis 
may develop within 10-12 hours depending upon the body. In the instant case 
the rigor mortis might have developed within 10-12 hours. Usually, the rigor 
mortis starts to disappear after 12 hours after developing.” (emphasis supplied)  
Rigor mortis is a term which stands for the stiffness of voluntary and involuntary 
muscles in human body after death. It starts within 2 to 4 hours of death and fully 
develops in about 12-hours in temperate climate. Similarly, the reverse process 
with which rigor mortis disappears is called algor mortis. In support of duration 
required to develop rigor mortis, an extract from “The Principles And Practice 
Of Medical Jurisprudence” by  Alfred Swaine Taylor,MD , is being referred 
hereunder:-  
"In sudden natural deaths occurring in a temperate climate during 
average seasonal conditions rigor mortis usually commences within 2 
to 4 hours of death. It reaches a peak in about 12 hours and starts to 

Murder Reference No.14 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 351-J of 2022 
26 
 
disappear after another 12 hours. The cadaver becoming limp some 36 
hours after death."  
Likewise, Dr. S. Siddiq Husain in Chapter-V of his book "Forensic Medicine and 
Toxicology”, observed that in temperate climate the rigor mortis completes in 8 
to 12 hours. Similarly, William Carroll in his research article titled as "An 
Examination of Muscle Function", has declared a similar duration for rigor mortis 
to develop. In Chapter 15 ‘POST-MORTEM CHANGES AND TIME SINCE 
DEATH”, from page 351 to page 352 of Rai Bahadur Jaising P. Modi's A 
Textbook of Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology (26th  Edition 2018) ,it has 
been discoursed as under:-:  
"Rigor mortis generally occurs, while the body is cooling. It is in no way 
connected with the nervous system, and it develops even in paralyzed 
limbs, provided the paralyzed muscle tissues have not suffered much in 
nutrition. It is retarded by perfusion with normal saline.  
Owing to the setting in of rigor mortis all the muscles of the body 
become stiff, hard, opaque and contracted, but they do not alter the 
position of body or limb. A joint rendered stiff and rigid after death, if 
flexed forcibly by mechanical violence, will remain supple and flaccid, 
but will not return to its original position after the force is withdrawn; 
whereas a joint contracted during life in cases of hysteria or catalepsy 
will return to the same condition after the force is taken away.  
Rigor mortis first appears in the involuntary muscles, and then in the 
voluntary. In the heart it appears, as a rule, within an hour after death, 
and may be mistaken for hypertrophy, and its relaxation or dilatation, 
atrophy or degeneration. The left chambers are affected more than the 

Murder Reference No.14 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 351-J of 2022 
27 
 
right. Post-mortem delivery may occur owing to contraction of the 
uterine muscular fibres.  
In the voluntary muscles rigor mortis follows a definite course. It first 
occurs in the muscles of the eyelids, next in the muscles of the back of 
the neck and lower jaw, then in those of the front of the neck, face, chest 
and upper extremities, and lastly extends downwards to the muscles of 
the abdomen and lower extremities. Last to be affected are the small 
muscles of the fingers and toes. It passes off in the same sequence. 
However, according to H.A. Shapiro this progress of rigor mortis from 
proximal to distal areas is apparent only, it actually starts in all muscles 
simultaneously but one can distinguish the early developing and fully 
established stage, which gives an indication of the time factor.  
Time of Onset.- This varies greatly in different cases, but the average 
period of its onset may be regarded as three to six hours after death in 
temperate climates, and it may take two to three hours to develop. 
Duration-In temperate regions, rigor mortis usually lasts for two to three 
days. In northern India, the usual duration of rigor morts is 24 10 48 
hours in winter and 18 to 36 hours in summer. According to the 
investigations of Mackenzie, in Calcutta, the average duration is 
nineteen hours and twelve minutes, the shortest period being three 
hours, and the the longest forty hours." In Colombo, the average 
duration is 12 to 18 hours. When rigor mortis sets in early, it passes off 
quickly and vice versa. In general, rigor mortis sets in one to two hours 
after death, is well developed from head to foot in about twelve hours. 
Whether rigor is in the developing phase, established phase, or 
maintained phase is decided by associated findings like marbling, right 
lower abdominal discolouration, tense or taut state of the abdomen, 

Murder Reference No.14 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 351-J of 2022 
28 
 
disappearance of rigor on face and eye muscles. If on examination, the 
body is stiff, the head cannot be fixed towards the chest, then in all 
probability, the death might have occurred six to twelve hours or so 
more before the time of examination.” 
 The opinion of  Dr.Iram Zafar (PW-9) regarding the time between the death of 
the deceased and the post mortem examination of the dead body of the deceased 
also covers the prosecution case with a shroud of deep doubt. It was the case of 
the prosecution itself that the dead body of the deceased was found inside a shop, 
which shop was surrounded by many other shops. The prosecution witness 
namely Saqib Hussain Wajid, SI (PW-12), the Investigating Officer of the case,  
during cross-examination , stated as under:- 
“I reached at place of occurrence at 10:40 PM on 27.5.2021. It is correct that 
place of occurrence is thickly populated area. It is correct that no people of 
the locality except the private PWs joined the investigation. I did not investigate 
the private persons of the vicinity. The houses are adjacent with the shop (place 
of occurrence). So many houses are situated near the place of occurrence. 
The mattled (sic) road is leading in front of the place of occurrence and the same 
is a busy road. ” (emphasis supplied)  
In this scenario, when the place of occurrence was a shop surrounded by many 
other shops and houses, then if the murder been committed during rush hours , as 
suggested by the prosecution ,the same could not have gone unnoticed. The 
circumstances in which a dead body remained present for such a long period 
inside an open shop, without being discovered earlier and the circumstances in 
which and the period for which the appellant remained unconscious, needed to be 
proved by the prosecution, however, they were not, hence, clouding the whole 
case, putting it under layers and layers of dirt of uncertainty.

29 
 
20.      The learned Deputy Prosecutor General and  the learned counsel for the 
complainant  have placed great stress upon the recovery of the blood stained 
Shalwar and Qameez of the appellant and have stated that the recovery of the said 
blood stained Shalwar and Qameez of the appellant proved that the appellant was 
the one who had murdered the deceased . Though it is correct that the Shalwar 
and Qameez of the appellant were indeed found to be stained with blood by the 
Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore after analysis and the DNA of the 
deceased was also found present on the Shalwar of the appellant by the Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency, Lahore , however, it was not proved that how and when 
the said Shalwar and Qameez of the appellant were taken into possession and sent 
to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore. According to the Saqib Hussain 
Wajid, SI (PW-12) , the Investigating Officer of the case, he was handed over the 
Shalwar and Qameez of the appellant at the THQ hospital by Uzair Farrukh 76/C 
(given up prosecution witness ), who in turn had received the same from the 
Medical Officer who had examined the appellant. The prosecution witness 
namely Saqib Hussain Wajid, SI (PW-12), the Investigating Officer of the case, 
in his statement before the learned trial court , stated as under:- 
“Thereafter I proceeded to THQ Hospital Chishtian where Uzair Farukh 76/C 
produced before me clothes of injured Abdul Jabbar i.e. Shalwar P-1, Qameez 
P-2 which I took into possession vide recovery memo Exh.PC, 
…………… 
The clothes of injured accused were handed over to me at THQ Hospital 
Chishtian, which I made into a sealed parcel and took into possession. ”

According to the prosecution evidence, Dr. Waleed Bin Tariq (PW-11) posted at 
THQ hospital Chishtian, had examined the appellant on 27.05.2021 at about 
11.55 p.m as an emergency case. and Dr. Syed Muhammad Shoaib Akhtar (PW-
8), also posted at THQ hospital Chishtian, had examined the appellant  on 
28.05.2021. Neither Dr. Waleed Bin Tariq (PW-11) nor Dr. Syed Muhammad 
Shoaib Akhtar (PW-8) stated in their statements before the learned trial court that 
they had handed over any blood stained Shalwar and Qameez of the appellant at 
the THQ hospital to Uzair Farrukh 76/C (given up prosecution witness). To the 
contrary, Dr. Syed Muhammad Shoaib Akhtar (PW-8) stated that the appellant 
was wearing white clothes and there were no stains present on his clothes. Dr. 
Syed Muhammad Shoaib Akhtar (PW-8), in his statement before the learned trial 
court , stated as under:- 
“Stated that on 28.5.2021 I was posted at THQ Hospital Chishtian. On the same 
day injured Abdul Jabbar was produced before me by Uzair Farrukh 76/C 
alongwith injury statement Exh.PH for his medical examination. After giving 
first aid as per MLC record register Exh.Pl, the patient was referred to BVH 
Bahawalpur for further management.  
I followed identification mark i.e scar mark on right side of face.

The above reproduced statement of Dr. Syed Muhammad Shoaib Akhtar (PW-8) 
clearly proves that  manipulation was made by Saqib Hussain Wajid, SI (PW-12), 
the Investigating Officer of the case, to pad up the prosecution case, with creation 
of false evidence. 
21. 
The learned Deputy Prosecutor General  and  the learned counsel for the 
complainant  have placed great reliance upon the recovery of the Churri (P-1) 
from the place of occurrence and have stated that the recovery of the said Churri 
(P-1) from the place of occurrence proved that the same had been used by the 
appellant to commit the murder. The Investigating Officer of the case and the 
Crime Scene Unit did not gather the fingerprints either from the shop or even on 
the Churri (P-1)  which was allegedly used for committing the offence in 
question. If the fingerprints on the Churri (P-1) were to be that of the appellant 
alone, such factor could certainly have weighed against the appellant. In this case, 
besides the above mentioned omission, a strong fact pointing towards the 
innocence of the appellant has been noted by us, being that the Churri (P-1) 
recovered from the place of occurrence, which was sent to the Punjab Forensic 
Science Agency, Lahore for analysis, had DNA of the deceased present on its 
handle and no DNA of the appellant was found present on the said Churri (P-1). 
The relevant portion of the report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore 
(Exh.PU) reads as under:- 
“8. A knife collected from ground near western wall at crime scene  
8.1   Swab(s) taken from blade of knife. 
8.2  Swab(s) taken from handle of knife. 
…………..

The DNA profile obtained from item #1.1,3.2, 5, 6,8.1 and 8.2 matches the 
DNA profile of Bushra Bibi (item #4). The probability of finding an unrelated 
individual at random in the population as being the source of DNA obtained 
these items is approximately one in 9 quintillion in Caucasians.” (emphasis 
supplied)  
The report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PU) supports the 
claim of the appellant that he was innocent for the reason that had the appellant 
handled the Churri (P-1) which was found from the place of occurrence, then his 
DNA profile must had been obtained from the said Churri (P-1)  because had he 
touched the Churri (P-1), then the epithelial cells from the skin of the appellant 
must have been left behind on the Churri (P-1)  handled by him and subsequently 
the presence of DNA profile of the appellant would have been identified on the 
Churri (P-1)  by the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore .  The absence of 
any DNA profile of the appellant on the Churri (P-1) sent to the Punjab Forensic 
Science Agency, Lahore for DNA analysis creates further doubt regarding the 
involvement of the appellant in the occurrence. Moreover, the presence of the 
DNA of the deceased on the handle of the Churri (P-1) creates deep crevices of 
ambiguity in the prosecution case. It has not been explained as to why the DNA 
profile of the deceased was found on the handle of the Churri (P-1) and no DNA 
profile of the appellant was found by the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, 
Lahore on the said handle. 
23. 
The learned Deputy Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the 
complainant have also relied upon the evidence of motive and submitted that it 
corroborated the prosecution case. The motive of the occurrence as stated by 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-1) in the oral statement (Exh. PA)  was that the appellant 

Murder Reference No.14 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 351-J of 2022 
33 
 
had doubts over the moral conduct of the deceased and the appellant suspected 
the deceased of having illicit relations with other men. It was candidly admitted 
by the prosecution witness namely Saqib Hussain Wajid, SI (PW-12), the 
Investigating Officer of the case, that there was no evidence collected during the 
investigation of the case regarding the alleged motive and admitted during cross-
examination , as under:- 
“ It is correct that I did not collect evidence regarding the motive.” 
There is no evidence on record that Mst. Bushra Bibi (deceased) was facing any 
threat to her life at the hands of the appellant prior to the occurrence rather to the 
contrary she was living with the appellant till her tragic death. This also proves 
that the appellant and the deceased were having a happy and a healthy marital life 
and hence there did not exist any reason for the appellant to have murdered his 
loving wife. The prosecution witnesses failed to provide evidence enabling us to 
determine the truthfulness of the motive alleged and the fact that the said motive 
was so compelling that it could have led the appellant to have committed the Qatl-
i-Amd of the deceased. There is a poignant hush with regard to the particulars of 
the motive alleged. No independent witness was produced by the prosecution to 
prove the motive as alleged. Even otherwise, a tainted piece of evidence cannot 
corroborate another tainted piece of evidence. The august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan has held in the case of Muhammad Javed v. The State (2016 SCMR 
2021) as under: 
“The said related and chance witnesses had failed to receive any 
independent corroboration inasmuch as no independent proof of the 
motive set up by the prosecution had been brought on the record of the 
case.” 
 

Murder Reference No.14 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 351-J of 2022 
34 
 
23.     The learned Deputy Prosecutor General has also argued that the dead body 
of the deceased was found present inside the shop of the appellant, therefore, the 
appellant be presumed to had murdered the deceased. It has been argued by the 
learned Deputy Prosecutor General that where any person dies an unnatural death 
in the shop of such accused, as in this case, then some part of the onus lies on him 
to establish the circumstances in which such unnatural death had occurred. The 
prosecution is bound to prove its case against an accused person beyond a 
reasonable doubt at all stages of a criminal case and the accused person could not 
be convicted merely on the basis of a presumption that since the murder of a 
person had taken place in his house, therefore, it must be he and none else who 
would have committed that murder. The learned Deputy Prosecutor General 
submits that it was in the knowledge of the appellant how the deceased died so it 
was the appellant who was responsible, in the absence of any explanation. The 
law on the burden of proof, as provided in Article 117 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 
1984, mandates the prosecution to prove, and that too, beyond any doubt, the guilt 
of the accused for the commission of the crime for which he is charged. The said 
provision provides: 
“117. Burden of proof:- (1) Whoever desires any Court to give judgment as 
to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of facts which he 
asserts, must prove that those facts exist.  
(2) When a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact, it is said that 
the burden of proof lies on that person.” 
On a conceptual plain, Article 117 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 enshrines the 
foundational principle of our criminal justice system, whereby the accused is 
presumed to be innocent unless proved otherwise. Accordingly, the burden is 
placed on the prosecution to prove beyond doubt the guilt of the accused, which 

Murder Reference No.14 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 351-J of 2022 
35 
 
burden can never be shifted to the accused, unless the legislature by express terms 
commands otherwise. It is only when the prosecution is able to discharge the 
burden of proof by establishing the elements of the offence, which are sufficient 
to bring home the guilt of the accused then, the burden is shifted upon the accused, 
inter alia, under Article 122 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, to produce evidence 
of facts, which are especially in his exclusive knowledge, and practically 
impossible for the prosecution to prove, to avoid conviction. Article 122 of  
Qanun-e-Shahadat,1984 reads as under: 
“122. Burden of proving fact especially within knowledge:- When any fact 
is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden to proving 
that fact is upon him.” 
It has to be kept in mind that Article 122 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 comes 
into play only when the prosecution has proved the guilt of the accused by 
producing sufficient evidence, except the facts referred in Article 122 Qanun-e-
Shahadat, 1984, leading to the inescapable conclusion that the offence was 
committed by the accused. Then, the burden is on the accused not to prove his 
innocence, but only to produce evidence enough to create doubts in the 
prosecution’s case. It may be noted that this issue was also dilated upon by the 
august Supreme Court of Pakistan, in the case of “Rehmat alias Rahman alias 
Waryam alias Badshah v. The State” (PLD 1977 SC 515), where, while 
deliberating upon Section 106 of the Evidence Act, which is para materia with 
Article 122 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, held as under: 
“Needless to emphasis that in spite of section 106 of the Evidence Act in 
criminal case the onus rests on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the 
accused beyond reasonable doubt and this section cannot be construed to 
mean that the onus at any stage shifts on to the accused to prove his 

Murder Reference No.14 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 351-J of 2022 
36 
 
innocence or make up for the inability and failure of the prosecution to 
produce evidence to establish the guilt of the accused. Nor does it relieve! 
the prosecution of the burden to bring the guilt home to the accused. It is 
only after the prosecution has on the evidence adduced by it, succeeded in 
raising reasonable inference of the guilt of the accused, unless the same is 
rebutted, that this section wherever applicable, comes into play and the 
accused may negative the inference by proof of some facts within his special 
knowledge. If, however, the prosecution fails to prove the essential 
ingredients of the offence, no duty is cast on the accused to prove his 
innocence.” 
The ratio decidendi of the above decision was further developed in the case of 
“Nasrullah Alias Nasro Versus The STATE” (2017 S C M R 724), wherein, it 
held as under: 
“It has been argued by the learned counsel for the complainant that in the 
cases of Arshad Mehmood v. The State (2005 SCMR 1524) and Saeed 
Ahmed v. The State (2015 SCMR 710) this Court had held that where a wife 
of a person or any vulnerable dependent dies an unnatural death in the 
house of such person then some part of the onus lies on him to establish the 
circumstances in which such unnatural death had occurred. The learned 
counsel for the complainant has maintained that the stand taken by the 
appellant regarding suicide having been committed by the deceased was 
neither established by him nor did it fit into the circumstances of the case, 
particularly when the medical evidence contradicted the same. Be that as 
it may holding by this Court that some part of the onus lies on the accused 
person in such a case does not mean that the entire burden of proof shifts 
to the accused person in a case of this nature. It has already been clarified 
by this Court in the case of Abdul Majeed v. The State (2011 SCMR 941) 
that the prosecution is bound to prove its case against an accused person 
beyond reasonable doubt at all stages of a criminal case and in a case 
where the prosecution asserts presence of some eye-witnesses and such 
claim of the prosecution is not established by it there the accused person 
could not be convicted merely on the basis of a presumption that since the 
murder of his wife had taken place in his house, therefore, it must be he 
and none else who would have committed that murder.  
……………………………………………………….. 
In a case of this nature the appellant could not have been convicted for the 
alleged murder merely because he happened to be the husband of the 
deceased.” 
In a criminal case, the burden of proof is on the prosecution and article 122 of the 
Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 is certainly not intended to relieve it of that duty. On the 
contrary, it is designed to meet certain exceptional cases in which it would be 
impossible, or at any rate disproportionately difficult, for the prosecution to 
establish facts which are “especially” within the knowledge of the accused and 

Murder Reference No.14 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 351-J of 2022 
37 
 
which he could prove without difficulty or inconvenience. If the article was to be 
interpreted otherwise, it would lead to the very startling conclusion that in a 
murder case the burden lies on the accused to prove that he did not commit the 
murder because who could know better than he whether he did or did not. Article 
122 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 cannot be used to undermine the well-
established rule of law that, save in a very exceptional class of cases, the burden 
is on the prosecution and never shifts. Throughout the web of the Law, one golden 
thread is always to be seen, that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the 
accused’s guilt subject to any statutory exception. No matter what the charge, the 
principle that the prosecution must prove the guilt of the accused is the law and 
no attempt to whittle it down can be entertained. In a case of this nature, the 
appellant could not have been convicted for the alleged murder merely because 
he happened to be running the shop where the occurrence took place, specially in 
the circumstances when the shop was found to be open, the appellant himself was 
found to be unconscious and the possibility of an intruder  could not be ruled out. 
An accused person cannot be convicted merely because he did not explain the 
circumstances in which the deceased had lost her life. The august Supreme Court 
of Pakistan has held in the case of “MUHAMMAD JAMSHAID and another vs. 
The State and others” (2016 SCMR 1019 ) as under: 
“only circumstance relied upon by the prosecution was that the deadbody 
of the deceased had been found inside the house of the appellant and, 
hence, it was concluded by the courts below that it must be none other than 
the present appellant who had done the deceased to death. We have found 
such an approach adopted by the courts below to be nothing but 
speculative”. 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in the case of “Arshad Khan  vs. 
The State” (2017 SCMR 564 ) as under: 

Murder Reference No.14 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 351-J of 2022 
38 
 
“It may be true that it has been held by this Court in the cases of Arshad 
Mehmood v. The State (2005 SCMR 1524) and Saeed Ahmed v. The State 
(2015 SCMR 710) that in such cases some part of the onus lies on the 
accused person to explain as to how and in which circumstances the 
accused person’s wife had died an unnatural death inside the confines of 
the matrimonial home but at the same time it has also been clarified by this 
Court in the case of Abdul Majeed v. The State (2011 SCMR 941) that 
where the prosecution completely fails to discharge its initial onus there no 
part of the onus shifts to the accused person at all.” 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in the case of “Nazeer Ahmed vs. 
The State” (2016 SCMR 1628 ) as under: 
“It may be true that when a vulnerable dependant is done to death inside 
the confines of a house, particularly during a night, there some part of the 
onus lies on the close relatives of the deceased to explain as to how their 
near one had met an unnatural death but where the prosecution utterly fails 
to prove its own case against an accused person there the accused person 
cannot be convicted on the sole basis of his failure to explain the death. 
These aspects of the legal issue have been commented upon by this Court 
in the cases of Arshad Mehmood v. The State (2005 SCMR 1524), Abdul 
Majeed v. The State (2011 SCMR 941) and Saeed Ahmed v. The State (2015 
SCMR 710).” 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in the case of “Asad Khan vs. The 
State” (PLD 2017 Supreme Court 681 ) as under: 
“It had been held by this Court in the case of Arshad Mehmood v. The State 
(2005 SCMR 1524) that where a wife of a person dies an unnatural death 
in the house of such person there some part of the onus lies on him to 
establish the circumstances in which such unnatural death had occurred. 
In the later case of Saeed Ahmed v. The State (2015 SCMR 710) the said 
legal position had been elaborated and it had been held that an accused 
person is under some kind of an obligation to explain the circumstances in 
which his vulnerable dependent had met an unnatural death within the 
confines of his house; It had, however, been held in the case of Abdul 
Majeed v. The State (2011 SCMR 941) that where the entire case of the 
prosecution stands demolished or is found to be utterly unbelievable there 
an accused person cannot be convicted merely because he did not explain 
the circumstances in which his wife or some vulnerable dependent had lost 
his life. In such a case the entire burden of proof cannot be shifted to him 
in that regard if the case of the prosecution itself collapses. The present 
case is a case of the latter category wherein the entire case of the 
prosecution has been found by us to be utterly unbelievable and the same 
stands demolished and, thus, we cannot sustain the appellant’s conviction 
and sentence merely on the basis of an inference or a supposition qua his 
involvement.” 

Murder Reference No.14 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 351-J of 2022 
39 
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in the case of “Abdul Majeed vs. 
The State” (2011 SCMR 941 ) as under: 
“The basic principle of criminal law is that it is the burden of the 
prosecution to prove its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. 
This burden remains throughout and does not shift to the accused, who is 
only burdened to prove a defence plea, if he takes one. The strangulation 
to death of the appellant’s wife in his house may be a circumstance to be 
taken into account along with the other prosecution evidence. However; 
this by itself would not be sufficient to establish the appellant’s guilt in the 
absence of any other evidence of the prosecution connecting him to the 
crime. The prosecution has also not been able to establish that the 
appellant was present in the house at the time his wife was murdered. This, 
perhaps, distinguishes this case from that of “Afzal Hussain Shah v. The 
State” (ibid) where the accused admittedly was present in the house when 
his wife was killed.” 
 
24. 
It is well to remember that in cases where the evidence is of a 
circumstantial nature, the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to 
be drawn should in the first instance be fully established and all the facts so 
established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the 
accused. Again, the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency 
and they should be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to 
be proved. In other words, there must be a chain of evidence so far complete as 
not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the innocence 
of the accused and it must be such as to show that within all human probability 
the act must have been done by the accused. It may be noted here that the 
circumstances concerned must or should and not may be established. There is not 
only a grammatical but a legal distinction between may be proved and  must be 
or should be proved. Certainly, it is a primary principle that the accused must be 
and not merely may be guilty before a court can convict and the mental distance 
between may be and must be is long and divides vague conjectures from sure 

Murder Reference No.14 of 2022

conclusions. This indicates the cardinal principle of criminal jurisprudence that a 
case can be said to be proved only when there is certain and explicit evidence and 
no person can be convicted on pure moral conviction. Another golden thread 
which runs through the web of the administration of justice in criminal cases is 
that if two views are possible on the evidence adduced in the case one pointing 
to the guilt of the accused and the other to his innocence, the view which is 
favourable to the accused should be adopted. This principle has special relevance 
in cases where in the guilt of the accused is sought to be established by 
circumstantial evidence. It is a cardinal principle of justice and law that only the 
intrinsic worth and probative value of the evidence would play a decisive role in 
determining the guilt or innocence of an accused person. Even evidence of an 
uninterested witness, not inimical to the accused, may be corrupted deliberately 
while evidence of an inimical witness, if found consistent with the other evidence 
corroborating it, may be relied upon. Reliance in this regard may be placed on the 
case of Waqar Zaheer vs. The State (1991 PSC 281).It is a known and settled 
principle of law that the prosecution primarily is bound to establish guilt against 
the accused without a shadow of reasonable doubt by producing trustworthy, 
convincing and coherent evidence enabling the Court to draw a conclusion about 
whether the prosecution has succeeded in establishing accusation against the 
accused or otherwise and if it comes to the conclusion that charges, so imputed 
against the accused, have not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, then the 
accused becomes entitled to acquittal. In such a situation, the Court has no 
jurisdiction to abridge the such right of the accused. To ascertain as to whether 
the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt, the Court can conclude by 
considering the agglomerated effect of the evidence available on record as held 

Murder Reference No.14 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 351-J of 2022 
41 
 
in the cases of Safdar Ali v. The Crown (PLD 1953 F.C. 93) and Muhammad 
Luqman v. The State (PLD 1970 SC 10). In the instant case, we have scanned the 
prosecution evidence in-depth and we are persuaded to hold that the prosecution 
has failed to produce trustworthy, confidence-inspiring and consistent evidence 
against the appellant. Conversely, the evidence so brought on record appears to 
have been fabricated to prove the prosecution case. Even otherwise, the evidence 
suffers from material discrepancies, contradictions and omissions and for such 
reasons it has not proved the case against the appellant intrinsically and if the 
evidence of such defective quality is accepted, it would produce an illusory 
judgment which apparently would not be sustainable in the eye of the  law in view 
of the principles laid down by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the 
judgments referred to hereinabove. Even otherwise, the prosecution evidence is 
inconsistent, thus, on basis of the same, the appellant cannot further be immured 
because he has every right to claim guarantee of the Constitution which provides 
that every citizen of the country shall be dealt with in accordance with the law. 
These self-negating and contradictory statements of the witnesses reflect that the 
witnesses are not truthful and they are supporting the afterthought, fabricated and 
concocted story meant to create incriminating evidence to strengthen the case of 
the unwitnessed  occurrence against the appellant. The august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the case of Imran alias Dully and another Vs. the State and  others 
(2015 SCMR 155) at page 164 has held as under:- 
“By now, it is a consistent view that  when any case rests entirely on 
circumstantial evidence then, each piece of evidence collected must 
provide all links making out one straight chain where on one end its noose 
fit in the neck of the accused and the other end touches the dead body. Any 
link missing from the chain would disconnect and break the whole chain 
to connect the one with the other and in that event conviction cannot be 
safely recorded and that too on a capital charge.” 

Murder Reference No.14 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 351-J of 2022 
42 
 
To carry a conviction on a capital charge it is essential that the courts should 
deeply scrutinize the circumstantial evidence because fabricating of such 
evidence is not uncommon and very minute and narrow examination of the same 
is necessary to secure the ends of justice. It is imperative for the prosecution to 
provide all links in chain, where one end of the same touches the dead body and 
the other, the neck of the accused. The present case is of such a nature that many 
links are missing in the chain. It would not be wrong to observe that in this 
particular case, it can be said that there is no link, what to talk about a chain. The 
august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Fiaz Ahmad Vs. The State (2017 
SCMR 2026) has observed at page 2030 as under:- 
“It may also be kept in mind that sometimes the investigating agency 
collects circumstantial evidence seems apparently believable however, if 
the strict standards of scrutiny are applied there would appear many cracks 
and doubts in the same which are always inherent therein and in that case 
Courts have to discard and disbelieve the same.” 
 
25.      Considering all the above circumstances, we entertain serious doubt in our 
minds regarding the involvement of the appellant namely Abdul Jabbar son of 
Jan Muhammad in the present case. It is a settled principle of law that for giving 
the benefit of doubt it is not necessary that there should be so many circumstances 
rather if only a single circumstance creating reasonable doubt in the mind of a 
prudent person is available, then such benefit is to be extended to an accused not 
as a matter of concession but as of right. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan 
in the case of “Muhammad Mansha Vs. The State” (2018 SCMR 772) has 
enunciated the following principle: 
“Needless to mention that while giving the benefit of doubt to an 
accused it is not necessary that there should be many circumstances 
creating doubt. If there is a circumstance which creates reasonable 
doubt in a prudent mind about the guilt of the accused, then the accused 
would be entitled to the benefit of such doubt, not as a matter of grace 

Murder Reference No.14 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 351-J of 2022 
43 
 
and concession, but as a matter of right. It is based on the maxim, “it is 
better that ten guilty persons be acquitted rather than one innocent 
person be convicted”. Reliance in this behalf can be made upon the 
cases of Tariq Pervez v. The State (1995 SCMR 1345), Ghulam Qadir 
and 2 others v. The State (2008 SCMR 1221), Muhammad Akramv.The 
State (2009 SCMR 230) and Muhammad Zamanv.The State (2014 
SCMR 749).” 
 
Reliance is also placed on the judgment of the august Supreme Court of Pakistan 
“Najaf Ali Shah Vs. the State” (2021 S C M R 736) in which it has been held  as 
infra: 
“9. 
Mere heinousness of the offence if not proved to the hilt is not 
a ground to avail the majesty of the court to do complete justice. This 
is an established principle of law and equity that it is better that 100 
guilty persons should let off but one innocent person should not 
suffer. As the preeminent English jurist William Blackstone wrote, 
“Better that ten guilty persons escape, than that one innocent suffer.” 
Benjamin Franklin, who was one of the leading figures of early 
American history, went further arguing “it is better a hundred guilty 
persons should escape than one innocent person should suffer.” All 
the contradictions noted by the learned High Court are sufficient to 
cast a shadow of doubt on the prosecution’s case, which entitles the 
petitioner to the right of benefit of the doubt. It is a well settled 
principle of law that for the accused to be afforded this right of the 
benefit of the doubt it is not necessary that there should be many 
circumstances creating uncertainty and if there is only one doubt, the 
benefit of the same must got to the petitioner. This Court in the case 
of Mst. Asia Bibi v. The State (PLD 2019 SC 64) while relying on the 
the earlier judgments of this Court has categorically held that “if a 
single circumstance creates reasonable doubt in a prudent mind 
about the apprehension of guilt of an accused, then he/she shall be 
entitled to such benefit not as a matter of grace and concession, but 
as of right. Reference in this regard may be made to the cases of Tariq 
Pervaiz v. The State (1998 SCMR 1345) and Ayub Masih v. The State 
(PLD 2002 SC 1048).” The same view was reiterated in Abdul Jabbar 
v. State (2010 SCMR 129) when this court observed that once a single 
loophole is observed in a case presented by the prosecution, such as 
conflict in the ocular account and medical evidence or presence of 
eye-witnesses being doubtful, the benefit of such loophole/lacuna in 
the prosecution’s case automatically goes in favour of an accused.” 
 
26.  
 For what has been discussed above Criminal Appeal No.351-J of 2022, 
lodged by Abdul Jabbar son of Jan Muhammad (appellant) is allowed and the 
conviction and sentence of the appellant awarded by the learned trial court 
through the impugned judgment dated 21.05.2022 are hereby set-aside. Abdul

Jabbar son of Jan Muhammad (appellant) is ordered to be acquitted by extending 
him the benefit of doubt. Abdul Jabbar son of Jan Muhammad is in custody and 
he is directed to be released forthwith if not required in any other case.
