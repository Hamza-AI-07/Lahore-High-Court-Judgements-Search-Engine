legality of concurrent decisions, by the Labour Court(s) and then 
affirmed by the Punjab Labour Appellate Tribunal (the ‘Appellate 
Tribunal’) – [in some cases divergent decisions are subject matter of 
challenge, where Labour Court(s) had dismissed the grievance 
petition(s) but said decisions were reversed by the Appellate 
Tribunal].  
2.  
Essential facts concretized are that respondent(s) employees 
claim to qualify the benchmark of being defined as ‘workmen’ under 
section 2(i) of the Industrial and Commercial Employment (Standing 
Orders) Ordinance, 1968 (“Standing Orders, 1968”); and are 
allegedly employed in various provincial government department(s). 
Respondents hereby claim that they are performing their duties, 
actively, since being appointed on work charge basis and their services 
were extended, from time to time and still continuing. Their precise 
grievance is that in wake of incidence of prolonged performance of 
service(s) / duties, uninterruptedly, against the posts, possessing 
permanent character, they are entitled to be regularized as permanent 
workmen, which statutory right, though recognized under section 2(g) 
read with clause 1(b) of the Schedule to the Standing Orders, was 
denied. Respondents vent grievances by invoking jurisdiction of the 
Labour Court(s) under Section 33 of the Punjab Industrial Relations 
Act, 2010 (“the Act, 2010”), which provision of law provides remedy 
for seeking redressal of individual grievance(s). Respondents were 
successful in getting reliefs, some succeeded in getting redressal of 
their grievance(s) by the Labour Court(s) and some had accomplished 
objective(s) before the Appellate Tribunal. By and large, through the 
orders impugned, the services of the respondents were regularized with 
back benefits, accruing from the date of initial joining / appointment. 
Interestingly, in some cases directions for regularization were followed 
by instructions to the departments to prepare and issue service books 
by treating them as regular government employees – and in some cases 
additional directions were so comprehensive that status of the 
regularized permanent workmen became disguised as civil servants. In 
the shadow of aforesaid facts, these petitions are filed, heard and 

W.P. No. 2453 of 2024 
3
decided – details of the petitions decided through this single order are 
provided in Schedule-A, attached herewith and treated as part of the 
decision. It is pertinent to mention that no factual issues are discussed 
in the context of individual grievance(s) and the nature of the relief(s) 
granted by the Appellate Tribunal and extent thereof is not the subject 
matter of adjudication other than the determination of legal and 
jurisdictional questions. 
3.  
Learned law officer contend that irrespective of determination 
of the legality of collective claims of enjoying the status ‘workmen’ 
and ‘worker’ under relevant statute(s), respondents, claimed to be the 
employees of provincial government department(s), are not entitled to 
claim regularization under clause 1(b) of the Schedule to the Standing 
Orders 1968 because government department(s) are not covered under 
the expression(s), the ‘commercial establishment’ or ‘industrial 
establishment’ – defined under clauses (a) and (f) of section 2 of the 
Standing Orders 1968. Adds that even otherwise respondents are not 
entitled to invoke remedy under section 33 of the Act, 2010 because 
said enactment does not apply to the persons employed in the 
administration of the State, in terms of clause (b) of sub-section (3) of 
section 1 of the Act, 2010. Submits that dicta laid in the cases of 
“Province of Punjab through Secretary, Population Welfare 
Department and 2 others vs. Farzana Basharat and 2 others” (2020 
PLC 260) and “Province of Punjab through Secretary, Irrigation 
Department, Jhang vs. Sajjad Naseem and 3 others” (2022 PLC 44), 
were not followed, which alone constitutes a sufficient reason to allow 
petitions, set-aside the orders and dismiss grievance petitions, being not 
competent. Without prejudice to jurisdictional questions, they argue 
that Labour Court(s) and Appellate Tribunal had exceeded in exercise 
of the jurisdiction conferred by directing departments to prepare 
service books of employees regularized, without appreciating 
distinction between the status of ‘permanent workmen’ and ‘civil 
servant(s)’. Adds that even the employees, whose services stood lapsed 
due to non-issuance of orders of extension of their service(s), were 
regularized, which manifest lack of understanding of law and disregard 

W.P. No. 2453 of 2024 
4
for judicial pronouncements. Supplement that requisite conditions 
required to be performed before invoking remedy under section 33 of 
the Act, 2010 were not performed, which aspect was not appreciated. 
Further submits that employees working in the Education department 
were regularized without appreciating the limitation prescribed under 
clause (h) of sub-section (3) of section 1 of the Act, 2010. Lastly 
submit that services of the employees cannot be regularized from the 
date of initial joining, which tantamount to extend retrospective effect 
to the grant of regularization, a patent illegality. 
4.  
 Conversely, learned counsel representing respondents 
submit that employees seeking regularization of services were not 
employed or involved in the administration of the State, who are 
appointed on work charge basis and qualify as ‘workmen’ or ‘worker 
and workman’ as the case may be. Adds that regularization as a 
permanent workmen is a recognized right and statutorily guaranteed 
by virtue of clause 1(b) of the Schedule to the Standing Orders 1968, 
and any failure to grant such right is made enforceable under section 
33 of the Act 2010. Learned counsel submit that work-charge 
employees working in the Public Works Department of the 
Government were recognized as permanent workmen, in lieu of the 
nature of the services performed and were held entitled to 
regularization of services under erstwhile Industrial Relations 
Ordinance, 1969 in the case of “Executive Engineer, Central Civil 
Division Pak. P.W.D. Quetta vs. Abdul Aziz and others” (PLD 1996 
Supreme Court 610). Also cites the case of “Syed Matloob Hassan vs. 
Brooke Bond Pakistan Limited, Lahore” (1992 SCMR 227). It is 
argued that right of the employee(s), who had performed services for 
continuous period of over 09 months, without break, are regularized 
by the Apex Court of this country in the case of “Province of Punjab 
through Secretary Communication and Works Department and others 
vs. Ahmad Hussain” (2013 SCMR 1547), wherein grievances were 
raised by the employees working on work-charge basis in the 
department of Public Works Department Punjab, and grievances 
stood redressed. Further submits that employees are not employed in

the administration of the State and the ratio of decisions in the cases 
of Sajjad Naseem and 3 others” (supra) and ‘Farzana Basharat and 2 
others” (supra) were in conflict with the dictum laid in the case of 
Abdul Aziz and others” (supra), hence, the former decisions are liable 
to be declared as per incuriam, which have had no binding effect. 
5.  
Heard. Record perused with the assistance of learned 
counsel. 
6.  
Decisions impugned are examined, which are superficial, 
manifest neglect of judicial assessment and inadequate reasoning. 
One of the most critical questions that whether the government 
departments fall within the definition of ‘commercial’ or ‘industrial’ 
establishment, in terms of the Standing Orders 1968, and whether 
falling within the ambit of aforesaid expressions is imperative at all; 
which questions remained untouched. No deliberation  is found that 
whether government departments are either covered under the 
expressions ‘establishment’, ‘industry’ and ‘employer’, as defined 
under the Act, 2010, let alone any passing reference. There is no 
deliberation regarding the nature of work / services performed by the 
respondents and no adjudication that whether respondents are 
employed in the administration of the State. Working for the State 
and employed in the administration of the State have different 
dimensions, in the context of the controversy. There are many other 
issues which needed determination but left unattended. I opine that 
matter has to be remanded but after framing legal and jurisdictional 
issues, which primarily require adjudication during remand 
proceedings. After hearing learned counsel following legal-cum-
jurisdictional issues need adjudication – though some issues entail a 
factual inquiry to arrive at conclusive conclusion, especially an 
exercise to ascertain functions performed by the department(s)-cum-
employer(s) – which would provide an insight to determine the 
status of the department, be it an ‘establishment’ or an ‘industry’. I 
confine the scope of instant adjudication to decide controversy 
regarding diverging precedents and determination if at all doctrine of 

W.P. No. 2453 of 2024 
6
per-incuriam decisions is attracted. Nonetheless, issues likely to 
cause prejudice to the parties are left open for decision, upon 
carrying out requisite factual probe, except that issues are articulated. 
Following legal issues are identified and reproduced in sequel of 
significance. 
a) 
Whether the decisions in the cases of Sajjad Naseem and 
3 others” (supra) and ‘Farzana Basharat and 2 others” (supra) 
were in conflict with the dictum laid in the case of Abdul Aziz and 
others” (supra). 
b) 
Whether employees on work-charge basis could be 
construed as involved in the administration of the State – 
exclusion of such category of employees is provided in clause (b) 
of sub-section (3) of section 1 of the Act, 2010. 
c)  
Whether seeking enforcement of statutory right(s) 
guaranteed under clause 1(b) of the Schedule to the Standing 
Orders 1968 makes it imperative that the employer, which is 
government department(s) in the cases at hand, must qualify as a 
commercial or industrial establishment under section 2(b) and 2 
(f) of the Standing Orders 1968. 
d)  
Whether services of the employees hired / appointed on 
work-charge basis are governed under the statutory rules of 
service in the context of their conduct and discipline. 
e)  
Whether alleged right(s) granted / guaranteed under 
clause 1(b) of the Schedule to the Standing Orders 1968 could be 
enforced by invoking the remedy under section 33 of the Act, 
2010. 
f)  
Whether the Labour Court(s) and Appellate Tribunal, as 
the case may be, had exceeded their jurisdiction while issuing 
directions for preparation and issuance of service book of the 
employees upon treating them as regular government employees, 
once they are regularized as permanent workman. 
(g)  
What is the effect of the Policy decision issued through 
Notification No. SO(ERB)5-44/2019/WC-DW-Policy of 29th 
January 2021 issued by the Government of the Punjab Services & 
General Administration Department (Regulations/O&M Wing. 
(h) 
Whether the employees meet the benchmark requirements 
under the Standing Orders, 1968 and / or the Act, 2010.    
7.  
Issues identified are answered accordingly.  
a) 
Whether the decisions in the cases of Sajjad Naseem and 
3 others” (supra) and ‘Farzana Basharat and 2 others” 
(supra) were in conflict with the dictum laid in the case of 
Abdul Aziz and others” (supra). 
b) 
Whether employees on work-charge basis could be 
construed as involved in the administration of the State – 
exclusion of such category of employees is provided in 
clause (b) of sub-section (3) of section 1 of the Act, 2010. 
 

W.P. No. 2453 of 2024

8. 
Issues (a) and (b) are answered alongside on account of having 
proximity. I have examined the decisions in the cases of “Sajjad Naseem 
and 3 others” (supra) and ‘Farzana Basharat and 2 others” and at the 
outset found reasoning therein contrary to the dictum laid in the case of 
Abdul Aziz and others (supra). Relevant portion of the decision in case of 
Abdul Aziz and others (supra) is reproduced hereunder; 
“The work of construction or maintenance of buildings, which is 
performed by the respondents, does not have nexus with the 
sovereign functions of the State, and therefore, they cannot be 
described as persons employed in the administration of the State. 
The above work can be carried out through contractors. The 
respondents have nothings to do with the running of the 
Government they may be said to be contributing towards 
facilitating the functioning of the Government. I am, therefore, of 
the view that the respondents are not employed in the 
administration of the State and, hence, the above clause (b) of 
subsection (3) of section 1 of the I.R.O, is not attracted to. It 
therefore, follow that the provisions of the I.R.O. could have been 
invoked by the respondents. Since the respondents' grievance was 
that their Services were terminated in spite of the fact that they 
were permanent employees. In view of above paragraph 1 (b) of 
the Schedule to the Standing Orders Ordinance in violation of 
Standing Order No. 12, they could have filed the applications 
under section 25-A of the I.R.O.” 
 
9. 
It is incorrect to assume that every employee is employed in the 
administration of the State. The decision in the case of Abdul Aziz and 
others (supra) had aptly elaborated the expression “in the administration 
of the state” appearing in clause (b) of sub-section (3) of section 1 of 
erstwhile Industrial Relation Ordinance, 1969, which is pari materia to 
clause (b) of sub-section 3 of section 1 of the Act 2010. Respondent(s) 
employees are not civil servants. There is marked difference between 
persons working for the State and those employed in the administration 
of the State. Evidently, none of the respondent(s) employees are 
performing governmental governance role(s) or acting as policymakers. 
Essentially, employees are tasked with the performance of public 
services or public sector role(s), at the lowest ebb of the employment tier. 
It is the grievance of the petitioners that such determination was not 
undertaken. I agree that these issues are not discussed and need to be 
adjudicated in the context of ratio of decisions in cases of “Province of 
Punjab through Secretary Communication and Works Department and 

W.P. No. 2453 of 2024 
8
others vs. Ahmad Hussain” (2013 SCMR 1547), “Secretary, Irrigation 
and Power Department, Government of Punjab, Lahore and others vs. 
Muhammad Akhtar” (2009 SCMR 320) and “Lahore Development 
Authority through D.G, Lahore and another Vs. Abdul Shafique and 
others” (PLD 2000 Supreme Court 207). It is expected that aforesaid 
decisions would be considered in the context of facts of each case. I 
confine to the determination of applicable / binding precedent, since it is 
argued that in wake of decisions of “Sajjad Naseem and 3 others” (supra) 
and ‘Farzana Basharat and 2 others” Appellate Tribunal would treat 
employees as employed in the administration of the State, hence, 
decision be made. I hold that the ratio of decision in the case of Abdul 
Aziz and others (supra), was not considered or appreciated while handing 
down decisions in cases of “Sajjad Naseem and 3 others” (supra) and 
‘Farzana Basharat and 2 others” (supra), hence, latter judgments are 
declared per-incuriam, being contrary to the law enunciated by the 
Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan. It is important to discuss 
another serious question, which is whether remedy under section 33 of 
the Act, 2010 could only be invoked if government department(s) 
necessarily comes within the definition of ‘commercial’ or ‘industrial’ 
establishment(s) under the Standing Orders, 1968. I refrain from 
commenting on this query to avoid causing of prejudice but only refers 
to the ratio of decision in the cases of Ahmad Hussain (supra), 
Muhammad Akhtar and others (supra), and Abdul Shafique and others 
(supra), which provide pertinent insight in the context of controversy at 
hand.   
10.  Now I take up next issue. 
 
c)  
Whether seeking enforcement of statutory right(s) 
guaranteed under clause 1(b) of the Schedule to the 
Standing Orders 1968 makes it imperative that the 
employer, which is government department(s) in the cases 
at hand, must qualify as a commercial or industrial 
establishment under section 2(b) and 2 (f) of the Standing 
Orders 1968. 
 
11. 
It appears that Appellate Tribunal had not discussed the effect of 
first proviso to section 1 of Standing Orders 1968 – which issue need to 

W.P. No. 2453 of 2024 
9
be deliberated in the light of decision in the case of Divisional 
Superintendent, Quetta Postal Division and others v. Muhammad 
Ibrahim and others (2022 SCMR 292) – paragraph 17 thereof. Decisions 
in the cases of Ahmad Hussain (supra), Muhammad Akhtar and others 
(supra), and Abdul Shafique and others (supra), and Abdul Aziz and 
others (supra) had relevance in the context of present issue. In all the 
referred cases grievances alleged were raised in the context of 
rights/statutory protection extended under the Standing Orders 1968 and 
were addressed by invoking remedy under section 22-A of the Industrial 
Relations Act 1969, which clause is swapped with section 33 of the Act, 
2010 and section 33 of Industrial Relations Act 2012. There is another 
facet of the matter in issue, which was not considered in cases of “Sajjad 
Naseem and 3 others” (supra) and ‘Farzana Basharat and 2 others” 
(supra). The definition of expressions ‘commercial establishment’ and 
‘industrial establishment’ defined under sections 2(a) and 2(f) of the 
Standing Orders, 1968 are qualified by the words “unless there is 
anything repugnant in the subject or context”. Now whether statutory 
right claimed and guaranteed under clause 1(b) of the Schedule to the 
Standing Orders, 1968 against government departments is dependent 
upon department’s qualifying under the expressions ‘commercial 
establishment’ and ‘industrial establishment’. This interpretation if 
followed, would jeopardize the remedy provided for enforcing individual 
grievance under section 33 of the Act, 2010. Section 33 of the Act, 2010 
is reproduced hereunder. 
33. Redress of individual grievances.– (1) A worker may bring his 
grievance in respect of any right guaranteed or secured to him by or 
under any law or any award or settlement to the notice of his 
employer in writing, either himself or through his shop steward or 
collective bargaining agent within three months of the day on which 
the cause of such grievance arises. 
(2)  Where a worker brings his grievance to the notice of the employer, 
the employer shall, within fifteen days of the grievance being brought 
to his notice, communicate his decision in writing to the worker. 
(3)  Where a worker brings his grievance to the notice of his employer 
through his shop steward or collective bargaining agent, the employer 
shall, within seven days of the grievance being brought to his notice, 
communicate his decision in writing to the shop steward or the 
collective bargaining agent. 

W.P. No. 2453 of 2024 
10
(4)  If the employer fails to communicate a decision within the period 
specified in sub-section (2) or sub-section (3) or if the worker is 
dissatisfied with such decision, the worker or the shop steward may 
take the matter to the collective bargaining agent or the Labour Court. 
(5)  The collective bargaining agent may take the matter to 
the Labour Court, and where the matter is taken to the Labour Court, 
it shall give a decision within ninety days from the date of the matter 
being brought before it as if such matter was an industrial dispute. 
(6)  A worker may, within a period of sixty days from the date of the 
communication of the employers’ decision or from the date of the 
expiry of the period mentioned in sub-section (2) or sub-section (3), 
take the matter to the Labour Court. 
(7)  In adjudicating and determining a grievance under this section, 
the Labour Court shall go into all the facts of the case and pass such 
orders as may be just and proper in the circumstances of the case. 
(8)  Subject to the decision of the Tribunal, if a decision under this 
section given by the Labour Court is not given effect to or complied 
with within seven days or within the period specified in the decision, 
shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 
three months or with fine which may extend to five hundred thousand 
rupees or with both. 
(9)  A person shall not be prosecuted under sub-section (8) except on 
a complaint in writing by the workman if the decision in his favour is 
not implemented within the period specified in that sub-section. 
(10)   For the purposes of this section, workers having common 
grievance arising out of a common cause of action may make a joint 
application to the Labour Court.” 
 
 12. Section 33 of the Act, 2010 employs an expression ‘employer’, 
wherein no reference to expressions ‘commercial establishment’ or 
‘industrial establishment’ is found. The expression employer has 
relevance and for that matter expressions ‘establishment’ or ‘industry’ 
under sections 2(ix) and (xvi) are relevant. Expression ‘employer’ is 
defined under Section 2(viii) of the Act, 2010, which is reproduced 
hereunder, 
(viii). "employer" in relation to an establishment, means any person or body 
of persons, whether incorporated or not, who or which employs workmen in 
the establishment under a contract of employment and includes- 
(a) an heir, successor or assignee of such person or body; 
(b) any person responsible for the management, supervision and control of 
the establishment; 
(c) in relation to an establishment run by or under the authority of any 
department of the Federal Government or the Government, the authority 
appointed in this behalf or, where no authority is so appointed, the head 
of the department; 

W.P. No. 2453 of 2024 
11
(d) in relation to an establishment run by or on behalf of a local authority, 
the officer appointed in this behalf, or where no officer is so appointed, the 
chief executive officer of that authority; 
 
[Emphasis supplied] 
 
13.  If nature of the service / assignment of the employees does not 
involve performance of duties involving employment in the 
administration of the State, then why cannot the workmen invoke 
remedy under section 33 of the Act, 2010, for enforcement of right under 
clause 1(b) of the Schedule to Standing Orders 1968. In the case of 
“Federal Revenue Alliance Employees Union through President Vs. 
Federal Board of Revenue through Chairman” (2024 PLC 2018) 
definition of establishment was discussed in the context of clause (b) of 
sub-section (3) of section 1 of the Industrial Relations Act, 2012 and status 
of FBR was declared as an establishment, if not industry. This reasoning 
find support from clause (c) of definition of ‘employer’. Evidently clause (c) 
of section 2(ix) of the Act of 2012 is reflection of clause (c) of section 
2(viii) of the Act, 2010. I leave this question for determination of the 
Appellate Tribunal to assess the status of the government department(s) 
for the purposes of considering its placement in the ambit of 
‘establishment’ or ‘industry’ depending upon the scope of functions 
undertaken by the employer – government department(s). Guidance can 
also be solicited from the ratio in the case of “Messrs Pak Telecom 
Mobile Limited vs. Muhammad Atif Bilal and 2 others” (2024 SCMR 719). 
[next issue].  
 
d)  
Whether services of the employees hired / appointed on work-
charge basis are governed under the statutory rules of service in the 
context of their conduct and discipline.  
14. 
Admittedly, the services of the employees are not governed by or 
under the statutory rules of service, conduct and discipline. Employees 
are not the civil servant. [next issue].  
 
e)  
Whether alleged right(s) granted / guaranteed under clause 1(b) 
of the Schedule to the Standing Orders 1968 could be enforced by 
invoking the remedy under section 33 of the Act, 2010.  

W.P. No. 2453 of 2024 
12
15. 
Yes, such rights are enforceable in the context of the ratio of 
decision in the case of “Muhammad Atif Bilal and 2 others” (supra) – an 
individual grievance can be enforced upon invoking remedy under 33 of 
the Act of 2010 – [next issue]. 
f)  
Whether the Labour Court(s) and Appellate Tribunal, as the case 
may be, had exceeded their jurisdiction while issuing directions for 
preparation and issuance of service book of the employees upon treating 
them as regular government employees, once they are regularized as 
permanent workman.  
16. 
Labour Court(s) and Appellate Tribunal exceeded their 
jurisdiction while instructing the department for the preparation and 
issuance of service book to the employees, treating them as regular 
government employees, upon being regularized, without appreciating the 
distinction between a permanent workman and civil servant. Assumption 
of jurisdiction to pass such directions is erroneous and exceeds the scope 
of jurisdiction conferred. And if at all any employee, upon regularization, 
is claiming the status of a civil servant in the context of the assignment 
assigned, same had to approach the Service Tribunal and establish its 
status as a civil servant. No such jurisdiction vests in the Labour Court(s) 
and Appellate Tribunal. [next issue].  
(g)  
What is the effect of the Policy decision issued through 
Notification No.SO(ERB)5-44/2019/WC-DW-Policy of 29th January 
2021 issued by the Government of the Punjab Services & General 
Administration Department (Regulations/O&M Wing. 
17.  Appellate Tribunal will consider the effect of the policy 
introduced for the work-charged employees, daily wagers and contingent 
paid staff – which policy was framed in the light of the instructions of 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in terms of Order dated 11.12.2018 
in CP No.3340-3344/2018. [next issue]   
 
(h) 
Whether the employees meet the benchmark requirements under 
the Standing Orders, 1968 and / or the Act, 2010.    
18. 
This question will be examined by the Appellate Tribunal upon 
assessing the nature of the duties performed by the employees in the 
context of meeting the conditions required for ‘workmen’ under the 
Standing Orders, 1968 and ‘worker or workmen’ under the Act, 2010. 

W.P. No. 2453 of 2024 
13
19. 
Since no factual issues are touched but only legal issue raised are 
adjudicated. Therefore, issue of compliances of pre-requisite conditions 
before invoking the remedy under section 33 of the Act, 2010, question 
of limitation of the grievance notice, question of continuity of service of 
an employee, without any break in service or lapse of service, in absence 
of issuance of order of extension and issue otherwise raised by the partis 
to the lis, would be considered by the Appellate Tribunal while deciding 
the remanded matters, afresh – list of cases are detailed in Schedule-A. 
20. 
In view of the above, all these petitions, listed in Schedule-A, are 
allowed and the decisions of the Appellate Tribunal are set aside, and 
matters are remanded for re-determination, afresh. Appeals, wherein 
impugned orders were passed, shall be deemed pending before the 
Appellate Tribunal, which shall inter alia decide highlighted issues, to 
the extent relevant for the purpose of deciding the Appeal(s). It is 
expected that Appellate Tribunal will decide each and every petition in 
the context of the facts involved therein, independently and preferably 
within a period of three months from the date of this order. It is apprised 
that Government has initiated steps for ensuring that Appellate Tribunal 
becomes functional at the earliest.  
  
At the fag-end of the proceedings, learned counsel for 
respondent(s) employees claimed that employer(s) have withheld the 
salaries despite performance of services, and started forced terminations 
by withholding issuance of orders of extensions on the pretext that 
employees have initiated legal proceedings. This apprehension appears 
to be misconceived and otherwise overstated. For sake of clarity, it is
