13.04.2023 Sh. Waqas Javed, Advocate, for the Petitioner. 
 
Rana Tasawar Ali Khan, Deputy Prosecutor General. 
 
 
 
 
Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – Through this application 
under section 497 Cr.P.C., the Petitioner seeks post-arrest bail in case 
FIR No.188/2022 dated 29.07.2022 registered at Police Station Sarai 
Mahajir, District Bhakkar, for offences under sections 376 & 292 
PPC.  
2. 
 
Briefly, the allegation against the Petitioner is that he 
ravished the Complainant, a third-year student, at pistol point on 
29.07.2022. Additionally, he made her nude video clips and 
threatened to put them on the internet if she told anybody about the 
incident.  
3. 
 
The Petitioner has denied the allegation, but the 
Complainant’s Medico-Legal Certificate and the DNA test report are 
against him. During the investigation, the police recovered the pistol 
he allegedly used and determined that he did commit the offence. On 
a tentative assessment, there appears to be enough incriminating 
evidence against the Petitioner. The offence falls within the 
prohibitory clause of section 497 Cr.P.C. Hence, no case for bail is 
made out. This application is dismissed.  
4. 
 
Before parting with this order, I may point out something 
very disturbing in the Complainant’s Medico-Legal Certificate. It 
reflects that the doctor performed the two-finger test on her during the 
medical examination.

The two-finger test, also known as the PV (per vaginal 
examination), is an intrusive physical examination of a woman’s 
vagina to determine vaginal muscle laxity and whether or not the 
hymen is distensible. The doctor inserts two fingers into her vagina, 
and it is assumed that the ease with which the fingers penetrate her is 
directly proportional to her sexual experience. Thus, if the fingers 
slide easily, the woman is presumed to be sexually active. If they fail 
to penetrate or have difficulties penetrating, her hymen is considered 
intact, proving her virginity. 
6. 
 
The precise origin of the two-finger test is unknown. 
However, Human Rights Watch states that references to the test in 
Britain can be found as far back as the early 18th century, and it 
appeared in a leading medical jurisprudence book in British India in 
the 1940s.1 Over time, the test became common in this region and 
entered widespread practice in many hospitals. The most common 
descriptions of findings from finger tests in medico-legal reports are: 
“two fingers admitted,” “two fingers easily admitted,” or “two fingers 
not easily admitted.” In some reports, these remarks are combined 
with observations on whether the hymenal tear is “old”. Some doctors 
use terms like “patulous vagina” or “distended vagina” to describe the 
vagina. These findings are then utilized to give opinions on whether 
the rape survivor was “habituated”, “used to” or “accustomed to 
sexual intercourse.”2 
7. 
 
In Pakistan, courts do not insist on producing direct 
evidence to support the victim’s testimony if it inspires confidence in 
the facts and circumstances of a particular case.3 They treat the rape 
victim’s evidence on the same level as that of an injured complainant 
or witness and look for some corroboration only by way of abundant 
caution to satisfy their conscience and rule out any false accusation. 
One cannot dispute that the medico-legal reports of rape victims are 
relevant. However, where the results of a two-finger test are 
affirmative, courts and lawyers frequently conclude that the victim is

habituated to intercourse and assume that she was violated with her 
consent, thus undermining her moral standing and casting doubt on 
the credibility of her testimony. In Ghulam Mohay-ud-Din alias 
Baoo v. The State (2012 PCr.LJ 1903), because the “vagina admitted 
two fingers”, and the victim conceded that “she was not habitual but 
was subjected to sexual intercourse on many times”, the court held 
that “it is obvious that she is a person of dubious character.” In 
Muhammad Yousaf  v. The State (2015 PCr.LJ 53), the court 
considered an unmarried woman “not of fair virtue” because two 
fingers easily penetrated her vagina during the medical examination. 
In Muhammad Arif  v. The State (2012 YLR 918), the court held that 
if the vagina of the victim admits two fingers easily, then she is 
habitual to sexual intercourse.4 The accused in these cases were given 
the benefit of doubt and acquitted. In Rafiq Ahmad v. The State and 
another (2012 PCr.LJ 1321) and several other cases,5 the courts 
released the accused on bail because the victim’s sexual organs 
admitted two fingers. 
8. 
 
Research has shown that vaginal laxity is not a clinical 
indicator of sexual intercourse or habituation. Therefore, medical 
professionals and forensic experts consider the practice of virginity 
testing not only outdated, unscientific and unreliable but also entirely 
unnecessary for the prosecution of crimes of rape and other forms of 
sexual assault. The UN Statement captioned “Eliminating Virginity 
Testing: An Interagency Statement”, issued in 2018,6 explains that the 
vagina is a dynamic muscular canal that varies in size and shape 
depending on the individual, developmental stage, physical position, 
and various hormonal factors such as sexual arousal and stress. Hence, 
an individual with an undamaged hymen may or may not have 
experienced penetrative sexual contact. Similarly, there may be no 
trace of hymenal lesions following sexual assault. Hymen

examination cannot give conclusive evidence of vaginal penetration or 
the woman’s sexual history. The Interagency Statement advocates for 
the prohibition of all types of virginity testing. The relevant excerpt is 
reproduced below: 
 
“The utility of hymen examination as a test for virginity was 
reviewed. The studies indicated, as has been described in previous 
reviews, that the inspection of the hymen cannot give conclusive 
evidence of vaginal penetration or any other sexual history. 
Normal hymen examination findings are likely to occur in those 
with and without a history of vaginal penetration. A hymen exam 
with abnormal findings is also inconclusive: abnormal hymenal 
features such as a hymenal transection, laceration, enlarged 
opening, or scars are found in females with and without a history 
of sexual intercourse. One hymenal feature commonly examined in 
virginity testing is hymenal opening size. Hymenal opening size 
also was found to be an unreliable test for vaginal penetration. 
Hymen opening size varies with the method of examination, the 
position of the examinee, the cooperation and relaxation of the 
examinee, and the examinee’s age, weight, and height.”     
The concluding part of the Interagency Statement is as follows: 
 
“This statement establishes that virginity testing is unscientific, 
medically unnecessary and unreliable; it violates a woman’s 
human rights and is associated with short and long-term adverse 
health outcomes. The statement expresses a commitment to 
support efforts to eradicate all forms of virginity testing, thereby 
upholding the human rights of women and girls across the globe.” 
9. 
 
The World Health Organization (WHO) has also declared 
that the two-finger test lacks scientific validity and urges that it should 
be discontinued.7 Besides, it describes the test as invasive, degrading, 
and a “form of gender-based violence and discrimination”. The WHO 
maintains that a “woman’s sexual history has absolutely no bearing  
on … determining whether she was raped.”8 
10. 
 
Sir Nigel Rodley, the former UN Special Rapporteur, 
classifies “virginity-testing” as “a form of gender-specific … torture.” 
According to him, it violates the physical and mental integrity of 
survivors of sexual violence, and the discussions about whether the 
survivor is “habituated to sexual intercourse” constitute a form of 
inhuman and degrading treatment.9 Olson and Garcia-Moreno state 
that the two-finger test is not a useful clinical tool, and from a human

rights perspective, it is a form of gender discrimination, a violation of 
fundamental rights, and a kind of sexual assault when carried out 
without consent.10 
11. 
 
Here, U.K.’s Health and Care Act of 2022 deserves a 
mention, although it deals with a somewhat different subject. It 
considers virginity testing and hymenoplasty as violence against 
women and girls and a part of the so-called “honour-based” abuse 
cycle.11 The Act makes it an offence to carry out, offer or aid and abet 
virginity testing12 (with or without physical contact) and/or 
hymenoplasty13 in any setting, including medical community and 
home environments, where the purpose or purported purpose of the 
examination is to determine the virginity of the women or girl being 
examined. Since it is illegal, women and girls cannot consent to the 
procedures. The offences carry extra-territorial jurisdiction.  
12. 
 
Rape and sexual assault victims have long-term 
emotional, physical and social impacts, including depression, guilt, 
diminished interest in sex, break-ups of relationships, obsessive 
concern for safety and loss of trust.14 Inserting fingers into the rape 
survivor’s vaginal or anal orifice can cause additional trauma because 
it not only replicates the original act of sexual violence but can also be 
painful. Owing to its invasive and forcible nature, the examination can 
cause genital injury, bleeding and infection.15 The shame, guilt, and 
humiliation that the victim feels during the test may lead to panic 
attacks, shocks and trauma. 
13. 
 
Under international law, rape survivors are entitled to 
legal recourse that does not re-traumatize or damage their bodily or

11 According to the Guidance issued by the Department of Health and Social Care, Government of U.K., women and 
girls are coerced, forced and shamed into undergoing these procedures, often pressurized by family members or their 
intended husband’s family in the name of supposedly upholding honour and to fulfil the requirement that a woman 
remains “pure” before marriage. Some practitioners issue a certificate to prove “virginity” after a virginity test or 
hymenoplasty, while some simply tell the family or community members whether a woman or girl has “passed” a 
virginity 
test. 
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/virginity-testing-and-hymenoplasty-multi-agency-
guidance/virginity-testing-and-hymenoplasty-multi-agency-guidance). 
12 The law defines “virginity testing” as the examination of female genitalia, with or without consent, for the 
purpose (or purported purpose) of determining virginity.  
13 The law defines “hymenoplasty” as “the reconstruction of the hymen (with or without consent).

mental integrity and dignity. They also have the right to have medical 
procedures performed in a way that respects their right to consent and 
are conducted in a compassionate, humane and non-degrading 
manner. According to the Interagency Statement, the two-finger test 
violates several international instruments16 and ethical standards of the 
medical profession. As per World Medical Association’s Declaration 
of Helsinki (1964), the physician must safeguard people’s health. 
Health professionals who perform virginity testing violate the 
fundamental ethical principle: “First, do no harm.” Furthermore, in 
many cases, it is done without the victim’s consent, which constitutes 
a form of sexual violence that, depending on the circumstances, may 
amount to rape or torture by the standards of international legal 
jurisprudence.17 
14. 
 
In India, Narayanamma v. State of Karnataka,  
[(1994) 5 SCC 728] is one of the early cases that considered the legal 
value of the two-finger test. The Supreme Court held: 
 
“The factum of admission of two fingers could not be held adverse 
to the prosecutrix for it would depend on the size of the fingers 
inserted. Experience tells us that when medical experts try to opine 
about the medical condition of a woman used to sexual intercourse, 
it is described as an admission of two fingers easily, but here, the 
doctor qualified her statement by saying that it was painful and 
bleeding on touch. These conditions obviously related to the 
hymen. The doctor was thus clear in her opinion that rape had been 
committed on the prosecutrix. There was no occasion for the High 
Court to hold it to the contrary.” 
15. 
 
In Lillu alias Rajesh and another v. State of Haryana 
[(2013) 14 SCC 643], the Supreme Court of India held: 
 
“[Victims] are also entitled to medical procedures conducted in a 
manner that respects their right to consent. Medical procedures 
should not be carried out in a manner that constitutes cruel, 
inhuman, or degrading treatment and health should be of 
paramount consideration while dealing with gender-based 
violence. The State is under an obligation to make such services 
available to survivors of sexual violence. Proper measures should 
be taken to ensure their safety, and there should be no arbitrary or 
unlawful interference with their privacy.

“Thus, in view of the above, undoubtedly, the two-finger test and 
its interpretation violates the right of rape survivors to privacy, 
physical and mental integrity and dignity. Thus, this test, even if 
the report is affirmative, cannot ipso facto, give rise to a 
presumption of consent.” 
16. 
 
In The State of Jharkhand v. Shailendra Kumar Rai 
alias Pandav Rai [2022 SCC Online SC 1494], the Supreme Court 
deprecated the use of the two-finger test in cases alleging rape and 
sexual assault, reiterating that it has no scientific basis and neither 
establishes nor disproves rape charges. Instead, it re-victimizes and re-
traumatizes women who may have been sexually assaulted and is an 
insult to their dignity. Therefore, it must not be conducted. The 
Supreme Court further stated: 
 
“Whether a woman is ‘habituated to sexual intercourse’ or 
‘habitual to sexual intercourse’ is irrelevant for the purposes of 
determining whether the ingredients of Section 375 of [Indian 
Penal Code] are present in a particular case. The so-called test is 
based on the incorrect assumption that a sexually active woman 
cannot be raped. Nothing could be further from the truth – a 
woman’s sexual history is wholly immaterial while adjudicating 
whether the accused raped her. Further, the probative value of a 
woman’s testimony does not depend upon her sexual history. It is 
patriarchal and sexist to suggest that a woman cannot be believed 
when she states that she was raped, merely for the reason that she 
is sexually active.” 
17. 
 
In Pakistan, under section 164-A of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure 1898,18 the victim is required to undergo a medical 
examination as a part of the investigation relating to an offence 
committing rape, unnatural offence or sexual abuse or any attempt 
thereof. Section 164-B Cr.P.C. stipulates that DNA samples, where 
practicable, shall be collected from the victim with their consent or 
with the approval of their natural or legal guardian and from the 
accused during the medical examination and sent to a forensic 
laboratory at the earliest for analysis. All the reports with the doctor’s 
opinion are then used in the court along with the oral testimony of the 
doctor. However, the courts in our country have also denounced the 
virginity test. In Sadaf Aziz v. Federation of Pakistan and others 
(2021 PCr.LJ 205), a public interest litigation, this Court ruled that 
virginity testing is irrelevant, does not prove sexual violence, and is a 
humiliating practice. It stated:

“When seen in the context of an investigation into the incident of 
sexual violence, whether the victim was previously accustomed to 
sexual intercourse is hardly the determinative question. The issue 
is whether the accused committed rape on the victim in the time 
and circumstances complained of. If the victim is found to not be a 
virgin, it cannot and does not suggest that she was not raped or 
sexually abused. What it does is place the victim on trial in place 
of the accused and shift the focus on her virginity status. In this 
regard, the victim’s sexual behaviour is totally irrelevant as even 
the most promiscuous victim does not deserve to be raped, nor 
should the incident of sexual violence be decided on the basis of a 
virginity test.” 
18. 
 
In Sadaf Aziz, this Court determined that virginity testing 
contravenes women’s fundamental rights and, inter alia, made the 
following declarations: 
“(i)  
It is declared that the two-finger test and the hymen test carried out 
for the purposes of ascertaining virginity of a female victim of rape 
or sexual abuse is unscientific having no medical basis; therefore, 
it has no forensic value in cases of sexual violence; 
(ii)  
It is further declared that the virginity test offends the personal 
dignity of the female victim and, therefore, is against the right to 
life and right to dignity enshrined in Articles 9 and 14 of the 
Constitution; 
(iii)  
It is also declared that virginity tests are discriminatory against the 
female victim as they are carried out on the basis of their gender, 
therefore offends Article 25 of the Constitution; 
(iv)  
Consequently, to the extent that the 2020 Guidelines,19 SOPs20 and 
the 2015 Instructions21 mandate the two-finger test or the hymen 
test for the purposes of ascertaining virginity of the victim are 
declared to be illegal and against the Constitution and the 
Federation and Provincial Government should take necessary steps 
to ensure that virginity tests are not carried out in the medico-legal 
examination of the victims of rape and sexual abuse.” 
19. 
 
In 
Atif 
Zareef 
and 
others 
v. 
The 
State  
(PLD 2021 SC 550), the Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled that rape is 
a crime, not a medical condition. Instead of burdening himself with 
reporting the sexual history of the victim, the doctor should gather 
medical evidence. He should check for signs of recent sexual activity 
and see whether the victim has any bodily injuries, particularly to 
private parts, or has seminal stains etc. The Supreme Court said that 
bringing the rape survivor’s sexual history into the case by making 
comments about their body like “the vagina admits two fingers easily” 
or “old raptured hymen” is an affront to the reputation, honour and

dignity of the rape survivor and violates Articles 4(2)(a) and 14 of the 
Constitution. It stated: 
 
“A woman, whatever her sexual character or reputation may be, is 
entitled to equal protection of law. No one has the licence to 
invade her person or violate her privacy on the ground of her 
alleged immoral character. Even if the victim of rape is 
accustomed to sexual intercourse, it is not determinative in a rape 
case; the real fact-in-issue is whether or not the accused committed 
rape on her. If the victim lost her virginity earlier, it does not give 
anyone the right to rape her. In a criminal trial relating to rape, it is 
the accused who is on trial and not the victim. The courts should 
also discontinue the use of painfully intrusive and inappropriate 
expressions, like “habituated to sex”, “woman of easy virtue”, 
“woman of loose moral character”, and “non-virgin”, for the 
alleged rape victims even if they find that the charge of rape is not 
proved against the accused. Such expressions are unconstitutional 
and illegal.” 
20. 
 
In Atif Zareef, the Supreme Court observed that the 
courts had been allowing opinion evidence of medical experts based 
on two-finger tests, presumably under Article 151(4) of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat, 1984 (“QSO”) [section 155(4) of the erstwhile Evidence 
Act, 1872] which provided that “when a man is prosecuted for rape or 
an attempt to ravish, it may be shown that the victim was of generally 
immoral character to impeach her credibility.” However, the Federal 
Shariat Court declared that provision repugnant to the Injunctions of 
Islam,22 and then the Criminal Law Amendment (Offences Relating to 
Rape) Act, 2016 omitted it. A subsequent enactment, section 12(3) of 
the Punjab Witness Protection Act, 2018, specifically ordains that the 
court shall forbid a question relating to the past sexual behaviour of a 
victim. Article 146 of QSO also obligates the court to disallow any 
indecent or scandalous questions unless they relate to the fact-in-issue. 
The cumulative effect of all these provisions is that putting questions 
to a rape victim in cross-examination and leading any other evidence 
about her alleged “general immoral character” to impeach her 
credibility is prohibited. The Supreme Court, however, cautioned: 
 
“ … while allowing or disallowing such questions, the court must 
be conscious of the possibility that the accused may have been 
falsely involved in the case, and should balance the right of the 
accused to make a full defence and the potential prejudice to the 
complainant’s rights to dignity and privacy, to keep the scales of 
justice even for both.”

Lately, 
Parliament 
has 
enacted 
the 
Anti-Rape 
(Investigation and Trial) Act (XXX of 2021) to accord statutory 
recognition to the dicta in Atif Zareef and Sadaf Aziz. Section 13(1) 
thereof expressly prohibits two-finger virginity testing for the medico-
legal examination of a victim and adds that no probative value shall be 
attached to it. Section 13(2) states that any evidence that the victim is 
generally immoral shall be inadmissible in relation to scheduled 
offences. 
22. 
 
To sum up, the two-finger test is not mandated by any 
law. It is a medical practice which has been incorporated into legal 
jurisprudence as a criterion for determining a victim’s character and, 
consequently, her consent, which is crucial in finding out whether 
rape occurred. However, this test has questionable probative value and 
infringes upon the survivor’s fundamental rights.23 A distinguished 
scholar writes: 
“The Constitution of Pakistan guarantees various fundamental 
rights to its citizens. This was done precisely to create a new 
constitutional order wherein laws as well as customs and practices 
having the force of law that were inconsistent with those rights 
would be eliminated. Article 8 of the Constitution explicitly 
declares such laws and practices void. Virginity tests – a relic of 
past and outdated patriarchal conceptions of female autonomy – 
are precisely the kind of customs and practices that have no place 
in our polity and society under the Constitution they are entirely 
inconsistent with the fundamental rights guaranteed by it.”  
23. 
 
Despite the above-mentioned rulings of the Supreme 
Court and this Court, and the statutory prohibition, doctors continue to 
perform two-finger tests across the province. Those who do so are 
liable to disciplinary action for misconduct and can also be held for 
contempt of court.  
24. 
 
In view of the above, the Provincial Government is 
directed as follows: 
(a) 
Ensure that medical opinion in cases involving rape and 
sexual assaults is in tune with the current definition of 
rape under section 375 PPC.

(b) 
Ensure that the medical examinations of the victims of 
rape and sexual violence are conducted in accordance 
with section 164-A Cr.P.C. and DNA test as per section 
164-B Cr.P.C.  
(c) 
Ensure strict compliance with section 13(1) of the Anti-
Rape (Investigation and Trial) Act, 2021, and prohibit the 
use of the two-finger test during medical examinations of 
women and girls who have allegedly been victims of rape 
or sexual assault. 
(d) 
Ensure that medical examiners refrain from commenting 
on the victim’s past sexual history unless it is relevant to 
their physical condition and that they do not make 
findings, such as whether the patient is “habituated to 
sexual intercourse”, based on a medical examination.  
(e) 
Conduct workshops for healthcare professionals to 
communicate the procedure to be followed when 
examining survivors of sexual assault and rape. 
(f) 
Initiate appropriate proceedings against any individual
