MUZAMIL AKHTAR SHABIR:- Through this 
Intra Court Appeal filed under Section 3 (2) of the Law 
Reforms Ordinance, 1972, the appellant has called in 
question order dated 02.02.2023 passed by learned Single 
Judge of this Court, whereby constitutional petition filed 
by the appellant was dismissed.  
2.  
It is contended by learned counsel for the appellant 
that the learned Single Judge has not taken into 
consideration that in terms of Letter of Intent dated 
25.04.2018 accepted on 15.05.2018 and purchase order 
dated 18.05.2018, goods were delivered on 12.09.2018 
and repeat order was issued on 16.11.2018 beyond the 
stipulated period of six months which expired on 
14.11.2018 i.e., two days prior to the repeat order, 
therefore, the respondents could not have issued the 
repeat order, which was liable to be set-aside, whereas 
the said fact has not been taken into consideration by the 
learned Single Judge while dismissing the appellants’ 
constitutional petition.  
3.  
It is noticed that admittedly initial purchase order 
for supply of ACSR Conductor Osprey against tender 
No. 2080/DIST. opened on 27.12.2018 and Letter of 
Intent dated 25.04.2018 accepted on 15.05.2018, was 

2 
ICA No. 10644 of 2023    
Dated:16.02.2023 
issued on 18.05.2018 wherein provision relating to 
special conditions B(v) specifically provided as under:- 
“LESCO reserves the right to increase or decrease 
the quantity up to 15% during the currency of the 
Contract or within 6-months from the date of issue 
of P.O whichever is later, without any change in 
the unit price or other terms & conditions.” 
 
  
The afore-referred provision shows that the repeat 
order could be placed during the currency of contract or 
within 6-months from the date of issuance of initial 
purchase order, whichever is later. The expression 
‘whichever is later’ is a rider on the exercise of right to 
place a purchase order with increase or decrease of 
quantity by 15%, which could be done even through the 
initial purchase order and the same could be made during 
the currency of the contract or through a subsequent 
purchase order made within 6-months after initial 
purchase order had been placed, both of which situations 
could arise in the matter, hence, have been provided for 
in the afore-referred provision. The argument that order 
could only be placed within 6 months of the initial 
contract/Letter of Intent would be against the intention of 
the expression ‘whichever is later’ provided in the afore-
referred provision of the contract/agreement, which 
expression could not be treated as redundant or 
unilaterally rescinded, hence, in the given circumstances 
of this case, the six months are not to be calculated from 
the date of acceptance of Letter of Intent rather on the 
basis of initial purchase order issued by the respondents 
as the same was later in time. It is an admitted position 
that in terms of tender No. 2080/DIST. and Letter of 
Intent accepted  on 15.05.2018, no purchase order was 
placed prior to 18.05.2018 and in terms of the said 
purchase order, six months would expire on 18.11.2018 
and not on 14.11.2018 on expiry of six months of 
acceptance as claimed by the appellant. Even if the last 

3 
ICA No. 10644 of 2023    
Dated:16.02.2023 
date is excluded, the expiry date would be 17.11.2018 
and could not be treated as 14.11.2018, which calculation 
apparently has been made on the basis of six months 
calculated from date of finalization of agreement i.e. 
15.05.2018 or in alternate from 1st purchase order with all 
months comprising of 30-days each i.e., 180-days in 
total, which interpretation is not permissible under the 
law as the months comprising of 31-days could not be 
reduced by 01-day each to make such calculations.  
4.  
Learned counsel for the appellant states that in 
identical matter the learned Single Judge has already 
granted relief to the appellant through order dated 
25.01.2023 passed in W.P.No. 19629 of 2021, therefore, 
he is entitled to the same relief. Admittedly, in the said 
case, the repeat order was issued on 07.01.2021, which 
was beyond the period of currency of the contract 
executed between the parties on 03.02.2020 and also 
beyond six months of initial purchase order, which was 
issued on 05.03.2020, however, in this case the situation 
is different as the repeat purchase order was made within 
six months of initial purchase order and in view of 
expression ‘whichever is later’ it would be irrelevant in 
the circumstances of the case to consider the period of six 
months from the date of agreement/acceptance of Letter 
of Intent i.e. 15.05.2018, which was earlier in time. The 
learned Single Judge of this Court took the said aspect of 
the matter into consideration while dismissing the 
constitutional petition filed by the appellant. The 
operative part of the impugned order dated 02.02.2023 is 
reproduced below:- 
“This constitutional petition challenges the repeat 
order placed by the respondent-LESCO which is 
dated 16.11.2018. Learned counsel for the 
petitioner has relied upon a recent judgment 
passed by this Court under similar circumstances 
in W.P.No. 19629/2021 to contend that the repeat 
order could not be placed by LESCO and which 

4 
ICA No. 10644 of 2023    
Dated:16.02.2023 
infringes provisions of not only the Letter of Intent 
but also PPRA Rules 2004. Suffice to say that  
the facts of this petition are materially different. 
Letter of Intent is dated 25.04.2018. Thereafter a 
purchase order was made on 18.05.2018. The 
repeat order has been placed on 16.11.2018. This 
is within contemplation of the special condition B 
(v) which deals with repeat orders and which may 
be made during the currency of the contract or 
within six months from the date of issue of pay 
order whichever is later. Certainly in this case the 
repeat order has been placed within six months of 
the issue of the purchase order and thus it is not 
caught by the mischief of the special condition B(v) 
of Letter of Intent. There is no cause for this Court 
to interfere in the instant petition which is 
dismissed.”  
 
  
The facts of the case in W.P.No. 19629 of 2021 are 
different from the case in hand, where repeat order was 
placed beyond period of six months of initial purchase 
order, whereas in the present case, repeat order has been 
made within six months of the initial purchase order, 
which the respondents could place during the currency of 
the contract or within six months from the date of issue 
of initial purchase order, whichever is later. In view 
thereof, the afore-referred observation recorded by the 
learned 
Single 
Judge 
does 
neither 
suffer 
from 
misreading/non-reading of the relevant record nor any 
illegality or jurisdictional defect has been pointed out in 
the impugned order, for this Court to interfere in the 
same.  
5.  
For the foregoing reasons, the instant I.C.A being 
devoid of any merit is dismissed.
