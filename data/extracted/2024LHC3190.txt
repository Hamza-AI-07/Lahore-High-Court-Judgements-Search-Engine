Mr. Fazaullah, AAG with Abdul Rehman SI. 
 
Mr. Najeeb Faisal Ch., Advocate for respondent No.6. 
 
 
 
      This petition impugns the order dated 09.01.2024 passed 
by Magistrate whereby he agreed with case-cancellation 
report submitted by the police.   
 
2.   Learned counsel for the petitioner states that deception 
practiced by respondents No.4 to 6, cocked the petitioner to 
bring the matter for a criminal action which took a course 
through FIR bearing No.1781/2023 under sections 420, 468, 
471 PPC Police Station Ferozwala District Sheikhpura with 
the account that he entered into an agreement to sell with 
respondent No.5 of one acre land situated at Mouza Goya, 
Ferozwala 
District Sheikhupura 
in consideration of 
Rs.1,20,00,000/- through respondent No.4 (property dealer); 
respondent No.5 paid Rs.1,00,00,000/- (one crore)  to him 
through pay order and Rs.10,00,000/- (ten lacs) in cash and 
got his signatures on different papers, however, on demand 
of remaining amount of Rs.10,00,000/- (ten lacs) and copy 
of agreement to sell, respondent No.5 provided him a copy 
of agreement bearing No.BP-LHR-3824B23FFEA187E1, 
but no payment; perusal whereof transpired an agreement to 
sell of his whole land measuring 77 kanals and 04 marlas in 
favour of respondent N0.6 with whom petitioner neither 
executed agreement to sell nor obtained any amount. After 
investigation, police recommended the case for cancellation 
because no fraud was committed however, a civil dispute 
was already on the platform of civil Court.

3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that 
before agreeing with the cancellation report, learned 
Magistrate has not given notice to the complainant/petitioner 
and so much so in the impugned order expression was given 
of non-appearance of complainant in response to notice so 
issued which is not correct. On merits, he submits that in 
first investigation accused/respondents were found involved 
in the commission of offence and in second investigation, 
they were declared innocent, therefore, petitioner was 
constrained to file an application for change of investigation 
which was pending but in the meantime, police in 
connivance with respondents No.4 to 6 proceeded to file 
cancellation report before the learned Magistrate who in a 
haste agreed with the said report without observing the 
procedure properly.  
 
4. 
On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent 
No.6 opposed the contentions of learned counsel for the 
petitioner and states that part payment has been conceded by 
the complainant/petitioner because it was sent to him 
through banking channel, therefore, rest of the amount, if 
disputed, could only be resolved through civil proceedings 
for which respondents have filed suit for specific 
performance, whereas, petitioner has also filed suit for 
cancellation of document/ agreement. Learned counsel for 
the petitioner states that suit for specific performance filed 
by the respondents was dismissed and appeal also met the 
same fate. 
5. 
Heard.  
6. 
First question which is to be met is the notice to 
complainant before agreeing with the cancellation report. 
There is no cavil that officer incharge of police station is 
bound to give information to the complainant of any action 
taken by him during investigation, the relevant part of 
section 173 Cr.P.C is reproduced as under; 
 
“(b) communicate, in such manner as may be prescribed 
by the Provincial Government, the action taken by him 
to the person, if any, by whom the information relating 
to the commission of the offence was first given.”

                                                  (Section 173 (1) (b) of Cr.P.C.) 
 
Same is the command of Police Rules, 1934; according to 
Rule 25.57 which deals with final report mentions as under; 
"If the informant is present when the final report is 
prepared, he shall be informed verbally of the result of 
the investigation, and, after noting this fact in the final 
report, his signature or thumb mark shall be taken on it. 
If the informant is not present, he shall be informed in 
writing by postcard or by the delivery of a notice by 
hand, and the fact that this has been done shall be noted 
in the final report. 
 
                                              (Sub-rule (3) of Rule 25.57) 
 
Magistrate must ensure observance of above provision of 
law and rules when he receives case-cancellation report and 
if notice had not given by the police officer, he shall send a 
notice to this effect to the complainant. It is mentioned in the 
impugned order that notice was given to the complainant but 
he did not appear and it is said that presumption of truth is 
attached to such observation as per Article 129 (e) of Qanun-
e-Shahadat Order, 1984 but of course such Article could 
only be focused during a trial or regular inquiry but not in 
the present proceedings, therefore, it is directed that any 
adverse inference by such observation would not affect the 
case of complainant/petitioner.  
 
7.   Police after thorough investigation recommended the 
case for cancellation while following the process mentioned 
in Rule 24.7 of Police Rules, 1934, which says when 
information or other intelligence is recorded under section 
154, Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 and after investigation, 
is found to be (i) maliciously false or false owing to mistake 
of law or fact or (ii) to be non-cognizable or (iii) matter for a 
civil suit, case can be cancelled by the order of Magistrate. 
Before framing of Police Rules, 1934 the grounds for 
cancellation of case were being dealt with under High Court 
Rules & Orders (1931) Volume-III, which identifies only 
two grounds, i.e., (i) offence being non-cognizable (ii) case 
false or unfounded, as reflected from following rule; 
1. Magistrate's power to cancel cases reported by 
Police: - In regard to cognizable cases reported by the 
Police to the Magistrate having jurisdiction under 
section 157 and 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 

 
W.P. No.9158 of 2024 
 
4 
 
it frequently becomes evident either (a) that the offence 
committed was really non-cognizable, or (b) that the 
information given to the Police was false or unfounded, 
and the Police apply for magisterial authority to show 
such cases as "non-cognizable" or "false" as the case 
may be. The Magistrate dealing with the Police reports 
in such cases, that is, ordinarily, the Magistrate who is 
empowered to take cognizance of the offence upon 
Police report, in respect of the particular Police Station, 
under section 159 or section 173 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, as the case may be, may, for 
sufficient reasons, pass an order accordingly. 
 
                                                                                (Chapter-11: Part D, Rule-1) 
 
But through police Rules, 1934 more expressive grounds 
were introduced that encompass a third category as well, i.e., 
matter for a civil suit. The duty of Magistrate for agreeing 
with cancellation report is explained more clearly in High 
Court & Rules & Orders Volume-III, which is reproduced; 
 
2. Duty of Magistrate to satisfy himself before 
passing order: -When a Magistrate agrees with a 
Police report that the F.I.R./case should be cancelled, he 
acts in an administrative and not in a judicial capacity 
and the order he makes is not a judicial order. Such an 
order is not a revisable order and, therefore, the 
Magistrate is not required to give reasons for his order. 
 
Though, Magistrates should exercise this discretion 
freely in making such order after satisfying themselves 
as to the grounds on which it is sought to be made, yet 
they should not treat the matter as one of ordinary 
routine. (See Rule 24.7 of the Punjab Police Rules, 
1934 framed under section 46 of the Police Act, 1861 
and Bahadur vs. The State PLD 1985 S.C. 62).   
                                                              (Chapter-11: Part D, Rule-2) 
 
It is true that Magistrate is not required to give reasons for 
his order, because he is not functioning as a criminal court 
however while cancelling a criminal case he is required to 
act judicially, in that he has to act fairly, justly and honestly, 
a duty common to the exercise of all state power. Reliance is 
on case reported as “BAHADUR AND ANOTHER Versus 
THE STATE AND ANOTHER” (P L D 1985 Supreme 
Court 62). Order of Magistrate, in the circumstance is well 
reasoned: Thus, on merits no interference is required in the 
impugned order.  
 
8.       Coming to the contention that an application for 
change of investigation was filed well before the Magistrate 
agreeing with the case-cancellation report, it is trite that 

 
W.P. No.9158 of 2024 
 
5 
 
police can validly take up such application for consideration 
and if reach to the conclusion that there are grounds for 
change of investigation, senior police officer can direct the 
concerned investigator to seek permission from the 
concerned Magistrate to reinvestigate the matter, then 
Magistrate can pass appropriate order. Reliance in this 
respect is placed on following cases reported as; 
 
“WAZIR Versus THE STATE” (PLD 1962 (W.P.) 
Lahore 405): “DIN MUHMAMMAD SHAKIR alias D. 
M. SHAKIR versus D.S.P., ICHHRA, LAHORE” (PLD 
1977 Lahore 180): “MEHDI HUSSAIN SHAH Versus 
Malik KHIZER HAYAT KHAN AND ANOTHER” (1983 
P Cr. L J 1601): “ASGHAR ALI Versus THE STATE” 
(1983 P Cr. L J 2187):  
 
If the permission is declined then cancellation report agreed 
by the Magistrate shall be deemed as final and 
complainant/petitioner is at liberty to recourse to alternate 
remedy by initiating a private prosecution as held in a case 
reported as “BAHADUR AND ANOTHER Versus THE 
STATE AND ANOTHER” (P L D 1985 Supreme Court 62) 
with following expression; 
 
“The party is left free to institute a complaint on the 
same facts, and the same Magistrate does not even 
after passing such an order render himself functus 
officio. On the contrary he is quite competent to 
entertain and deal with such a complaint on material 
presented to him” 
 
9. 
With the above observations and direction, this writ 
petition stands disposed of.
