  Sultan Tanvir Ahmad, J:- The predecessor of 
the revision-petitioner (Muhammad Khan) instituted 
civil suit No. 187 / 364 dated 25.09.2002 with the 
averment that in mutation No. 6431 dated 30.08.1993 
(the ‘mutation’) 09 marlas property as detailed in the 
suit (the ‘suit property’) out of the total land measuring 
04 kanal 13 marla, has been incorporated by way of 
fraud by the respondent in collusion with the revenue 
officials.  The suit was contested and out of divergent 
pleadings the following issues were framed:- 
 
 
 
1.  
Whether the defendant with malafide 
intention got attested the mutation No. 
6431, dated 30.08.1993, by including 09 
marlas of plaintiff’s residential house 
situated in khawat No. 615/881? OPP

2.  
Whether the instant suit is not proceed 
able in its present form? OPD 
 
 
 
3.  
Whether the plaintiff has no locus-
standi to file this suit? OPD 
 
 
 
4.   Whether the plaintiff is estopped by his 
words and conduct? OPD 
 
 
 
5.  
Whether the instant suit is frivolous and 
vexatious? OPD 
 
 
 
6. 
Whether the instant suit is liable to be 
dismissed due to misjoinder and non-
joinder of parties? OPD 
 
 
 
7. 
Whether the instant suit does not lie? 
OPD 
 
 
 
8. 
Relief? 
  2.  
  The parties led their respective evidence. The 
learned trial Court decreed the suit vide judgment and 
decree dated 01.03.2010. The respondent preferred civil 
appeal No. 120 / 227 of 2010/14, which was allowed by 
the learned Appellate Court vide judgment and decree 
dated 27.03.2015 and while setting-aside the findings of 
the learned trial Court the suit has been dismissed. Being 
dissatisfied from the same, present civil revision has 
been instituted. 
  3.  
 
Ch. Muhammad Rafique Warraich, learned 
counsel for the revision-petitioner, has submitted that 
the judgment of the learned Appellate Court is result of 
gross misreading of evidence and the well-reasoned 
judgment of the learned trial Court has been unduly 
interfered with; that the learned Appellate Court has 
wrongly shifted the onus of issue No. 2 on the revision-
petitioner ignoring that it was for the respondent, being 
beneficiary, to prove the mutation through coherent 
evidence and by producing the relevant revenue 
officials.  
  4.  
 
Conversely, Ch. Irshad Ullah Chattha, 
learned counsel for the respondent, has vehemently 
opposed this revision-petition and he has stated that the 

 
 
                        Civil Revision No. 1750-2015                                                       3 
 
learned Appellate Court has reached to the correct 
conclusion; that the execution of the mutation, jalsa aam 
or attestation in course of normal official duties have 
never been denied, thus, not producing the revenue 
officials lost importance. It is stated that even otherwise 
the revision-petitioner has even failed to discharge the 
initial burden so that it can be shifted to the other side. 
  5.  
 
Heard. Record has been perused with the 
able assistance of the learned counsel for the parties. 
  6.  
 
It is trite that once a document has been 
proved in accordance with law, the genuineness of its 
contents can be presumed and the rule that the 
"document speaks for itself" (acta probant sese ipsa) 
can be deployed. The rationale behind the presumptions 
attached to written documents stem out of both principle 
as well as policy. The presumptions are a matter of 
principle because written documents are, by their very 
nature, to be accorded a higher degree of credibility as 
opposed to oral evidence; otherwise, it would bring 
uncertainty and chaos if written documents (and 
valuable rights, if any, attached to them) were allowed to 
be set aside on the basis of oral evidence1.  
  7.  
 
Reading of the suit reflects that Muhammad 
Khan, who passed away during the pendency of the suit, 
has never denied that the mutation was passed on his 
statement and in the presence of those who have signed 
the mutation (Ex.P-1). The suit property is categorically 
mentioned in the mutation with reference to its khata 
number and the consideration was paid for the total 
property, which is subject matter of the mutation. After

Hussain Shah (deceased) through LRs. and others” (2023 SCMR 1155) 

 
 
Civil Revision No. 1750-2015                                                        4 
the death of Muhammad Khan his son Abdul Razzaq 
appeared as PW-1 who deposed that they gained the 
knowledge about eight years after the mutation. In the 
entire examination-in-chief particular manners and mode 
of fraud are not stated. He simply deposed that fraud 
was committed in collusion with the revenue officials. 
He admitted in his cross-examination that at the time of 
bargain he was in Rawalpindi. To support him one 
Muhammad Ali appeared as PW-2 who is admittedly 
paternal uncle of Abdul Razzaq. He also could not give 
particulars of fraud in his examination-in-chief. He too 
admitted during his cross-examination that at the time of 
proceedings of mutation he was not present, thus, 
admitted that most of the parts of his statement are 
comprised of hearsay. In his cross-examination he 
attempted to develop the case and the answers given by 
him contradicted the original stance. In response to one 
of the questions he stated that respondent committed 
fraud / forgery in the mutation five years prior to filing 
of suit, when allegedly respondent asked the concerned 
patwari to enter the suit property in the mutation. This 
answer perhaps is given without realizing that in the suit 
it is averred that cause of action accrued a year prior to 
filing of the suit and the fact deposed as to asking the 
patwari to enter the suit property in the mutation is not 
even pleaded. 
  8.  
 
The respondent appeared as DW-1. He also 
answered few questions adverse to his interest, however, 
if the evidence is evaluated on the balance of 
probabilities, the balance tilts in favour of the 
respondent. So far as the argument regarding failing to 
produce attesting witness by the respondent-side is 

 
 
                        Civil Revision No. 1750-2015                                                       5 
 
concerned, the execution of the mutation is not denied 
by Muhammad Khan-deceased himself, therefore, 
examination of attesting witness is not fatal2. Even 
otherwise, the best evidence about the contents of a 
document is the document itself  3. 
  9.  
 
Lastly, learned counsel for the revision-
petitioner took the plea as to the variance in findings of 
the learned two Courts below. In my reading, judgment 
of the learned Appellate Court is cogent and based on 
sound reasons, therefore, it prevails over the findings 
given by the learned trial Court4. 
  10.   
  For what has been discussed above, the 
present civil revision is dismissed. No order as to costs.
