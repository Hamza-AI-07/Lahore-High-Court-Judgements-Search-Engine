Mr. Shah Nawaz Qureshi, Advocate.  
   
Mr. Muhammad Akhlaq, D.P.G., with Karamat, A.S.I. 
The present criminal miscellaneous application under Section 561-A 
of the Code of Criminal Procedure has been filed by Muhammad Yar, the 
petitioner, for setting aside the impugned orders dated 10.07.2021 and 
20.12.2021, passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, Wazirabad, 
and learned Additional Sessions Judge, Wazirabad respectively, whereby 
the application filed by the petitioner for superdari was dismissed and 
upheld by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Wazirabad. 
2. 
The petitioner-United Bank Limited through Muhammad Imtaiz 
Ahmad, through this petition has challenged the vires of the order dated 
10.07.2021 passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, Wazirabad 
and the order dated 20.12.2021 passed by the learned ASJ, Wazirabad, 
whereby the application of the petitioner for grant of ‘Superdari’ of car 
Toyota XLI was dismissed by the learned Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, 
Wazirabad and the petitioner has assailed the order dated 02.07.2014 before 
the learned ASJ, Wazirabad, who also dismissed the application of the 
petitioner for Superdari of the vehicle. Feeling aggrieved by the order of 
both the courts below, the petitioner has filed the instant petition.  
3. 
It is contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the 
orders dated 10.07.2021 and 20.12.2021 passed by the courts below are 
against the law and facts; that the petitioner bank extended finance facility to 
Shabbir Ahmad son of Khuda Bakhsh, through Hire Purchase Agreement but  
Shabbir 
Ahmad 
defaulted 
in 
repayment 
of 
the 
monthly 
lease 
rentals/installments and finance facility was not adjusted and referred the 
statement of account (available at page No. 45). The petitioner company is 
lawful owner of the vehicle in question by way of Hire Purchase Agreement; 
that the is ready to produce the car whenever court directed to produce the 
car before the court and that there is no other claimant of the vehicle hence, 
both the impugned orders be set aside by accepting the instant petition.

On the other hand, learned DPG has not opposed the petition 
vehemently.

Arguments heard. Record perused.  
6. 
The report submitted by city police officer Gujranwala reveals that the 
vehicle in question pertains to case FIR No. 569 of 2020, dated 4.8.2020, 
registered under section 457, 380, 511 PPC at police station Sadar 
Wazirabad, District Wazirabad. The complainant registered the FIR 
mentioned above against four unknown accused persons for attempting to 
commit theft of tower batteries.  Later, on 09.08.2020, the complainant, 
Naeem Rasool, nominated Shabir, son of Khuda Baksh, as an accused in the 
FIR. This suggests that Shabbir Ahmad, son of Khuda Bakhsh, to whom a 
finance facility was extended, was named in the above-said FIR. The present 
petitioner is the sole claimant of the vehicle to date, who has the original 
documents/Excise file. The report submitted by the City Police Officer, 
Gujranwala, reveals that on 07.03.2024, UBL Bank Square, Gujranwala, 
issued a letter stating that on 24.01.2024, a certificate was issued by UBL 
Bank to DPO Wazirabad, verifying that the vehicle registration No. LEC-17-
8169, Engine No.Z480178, Chassis No. NZE170R4106555 was leased to the 
customer, Mr. Shabbir Ahmad, son of Khuda Bukhsh, resident of Islam Pura 
Golay Bajway Road, Ward No. 26, Sanglahill, Nankana Sahib, under the 
Higher Purchase Agreement (HPA)/Finance Agreement dated 29-Mar-2017 
with United Bank Limited. The bank verified that United Bank Limited owns 
the vehicle mentioned above. The bank also verified that the original 
file/Excise file and a copy of the registration book are available in the bank 
record. The original registration book was handed over to the customer. As 
the vehicle in question, the bank financed the vehicle to the customer for 60th 
months” installment plan, which started from April-2017 and mature on Mar-
2022, customer deposited only 41 installments till the month of August-2020, 
thereafter defaulted in payment of monthly lessee rental and at present, an 
amount of Rs.655,594.90/- is still outstanding against the above said 
vehicle/customer and thereafter seized in case FIR No.569/2020 at police 
station, Saddar Wazirabad. In the circumstances, the retention of the car 
having registration No. LEC-17-8169 in police possession for an indefinite 
period would mean a completely damaged and deteriorated condition of the 

Crl.Misc. No. 9627-M/2023 
3
vehicle. In these circumstances, neither of the courts below was justified in 
refusing the ‘Superdari’ of the car in question to the petitioner. 
7. 
For the foregoing reasons, I accept this petition and direct that the 
vehicle in question be handed over to the petitioner on ‘Superdari’ subject to 
furnishing a surety bond in the sum of Rs.30,00,000/- to the satisfaction of the 
Illaqa/Judicial/Duty Magistrate. The petitioner is directed to produce the 
vehicle in question as and when required by the Court. The petitioner is 
further directed not to auction, sell, or transfer the car in question till the 
decision of the above-stated case. However, this order will not prejudice the 
right of a rival claimant, if any.
