3.  
 
The prosecution story, as alleged in the F.I.R. (Ex. PA) lodged 
on the written complaint (Ex.PA/1) of Muhammad Usman Ayub, S.I (PW-3)-
the complainant is that on 25.08.2021, the high-ups of A.N.F received a secret 
information that international smuggler, Tanveer Irshad had secretly 
concealed heroin in the cloth consignment, AWB number 235-2185-4302 in 
the name of Awais Fancy embroidery through A.S Global Logistic network 
(Pvt) Limited, Lahore while using the way air cargo Turkish Airline, AIIAP, 
Lahore booked for U.K, which was lying at Jerry Danta Cargo shed, AIIAP, 
Lahore and if a raid was conducted,  the accused could have been 
apprehended after that, a raiding team consisted of the complainant (PW-3) 
and other officials of A.N.F was constituted. While riding on the official 
vehicles, the raiding team reached New Jerry Cargo Shed AIIAP, Lahore, 
where the said consignment of cloth airway bill number 235-2185-4302 was 
lying, which consisted of 118 boxes and a person who was standing near the 
consignment disclosed his name as Umer Daraz. The said person, Umer 
Daraz, told the raiding team that Tanveer Irshad is the owner of said 
consignment and said consignment was sent for clearance through him by the 
accused, Shuja-ul-Haq Malik, Chief Executive Officer of AS Global Logistic 
Network (Pvt) Ltd, Lahore. Upon checking 118 cartons, from six cartons 
No.41,50,51,58,60 and 65, one packet of heroin from each carton weighing 
3.673 kilograms, total heroin weighing 22.038 Kilograms was recovered from 
the said cartons. The recovered substance was taken into possession by the 
complainant (PW-3) vide recovery memo (Ex. PB) after embossing a seal of 
U.A. Out of the recovered substance, a sample of 10 grams of heroin from 
each packet was separated for narcotic analysis. After that, the complainant 
(PW-3) drafted a complaint (Ex.PA/1) and sent the same to the police station 
for registration of formal F.I.R (Ex. PA).  
4. 
 
After hearing the arguments advanced by the learned counsel 
appearing on both sides, the learned trial court, while evaluating the evidence 
available on record, found the version of the prosecution as correct beyond 
any shadow of a doubt, which resulted in the conviction of the appellant in the 
above-stated terms.  

Crl. Appeal No.51188 of 2022

5. 
 
We have heard the arguments advanced by the learned counsel 
for the appellant and the learned Special Prosecutor for ANF and have 
minutely perused the record on the file.  
6. 
 
After scrutiny of the material available on record, we conclude 
that the prosecution has failed to establish that the appellant associated, 
facilitated, and abetted in booking parcels by using fake documents (edited 
I.D. card of one, namely Tanveer Irshad) vide airway bill No.235-2185-4302 
for the U.K from New Jerry Denata Cargo Shed, Allama Iqbal International 
Airport, Lahore. The raid was conducted by Muhammad Usman Ayub S.I. 
(PW-3)-the complainant and he (PW-3) took in possession 118 cartons, and 
from six cartons No. 41, 50, 51, 58, 60 and 65, one packet of heroin from 
each carton weighing 3.673 kilograms, total heroin weighing 22.038 
Kilograms was recovered. There are severe discrepancies in the evidence of 
the prosecution. Muhammad Usman Ayub S.I. (PW-3)-the complainant-the 
investigating officer, deposed during his court statement that, on 25.08.2021, 
their high-ups received the information through spy sources about 
international drug smuggler Tanveer Irshad resident of Lahore. A person 
standing near the consignment was the clearing agent of AS Global Logistics 
Pvt. Ltd and disclosed his name as Umar Ijaz (PW-5). He informed him (PW-
5) that the consignment belongs to Tanveer Irshad, son of Irshad Hussain, 
resident of Khanyki Jhugian post office, Rangeel Pur Lahore. The said 118 
cartons were checked. As per the invoice, cartons numbers 1 to 32, 75 to 118 
were comprised of ladies’ suits of multi colors, while carton Nos.33 to 74, 
i.e., 42 cartons in which 1/1 fabric thaan of multi colors was found. All the 
cartons were checked minutely, and six cartons of fabrics thaan of Khaki 
color bearing Nos.41, 50, 51, 58, 60, and 65 were found suspicious. While 
opening the thaans, which were in the above said six cartons, 1/1 packet of 
heroin wrapped in polythene concealed secretly in the middle of the cloth of 
each thaan was recovered. At the same time, Shuja ul Haq Malik C.E.O of 
A.S. Global Logistic Network Pvt. Ltd. (the appellant), reached the place of 
recovery. He (the appellant) also provided the same information that Umar 
Ijaz (PW-5) provided to him (the complainant). Muhammad Usman Ayub S.I. 

Crl. Appeal No.51188 of 2022

(PW-3)-the 
complainant-the 
investigating 
officer 
deposed 
during 
examination-in-chief as under: - 
“On disclosure of Shuja ul Haq Malik dated 
27.08.2021 I alongwith Shuja ul Haq Malik went to 
the shop located at Anarkali Bazar Muskan 
Fabrics which was disclosed by Tanveer Irshad and 
met with Hamza Shahid there, on asking, he 
disclosed his name Hamza Shahid s/o Shahid 
Sajjad resident of Rajgarh Lahore and disclosed 
himself as an owner of said shop Muskan Fabrics 
Muqadas Plaza new Anarkali Lahore. He further 
disclosed that he is running this shop for the last ¾ 
year, and on asking about the Tanveer Irshad, he 
disclosed that Tanveer Irshad is one of his 
customer, who came/visited first time at his shop 
8/9 month before, he asked/inquired about the rates 
of the cloth and said that he will purchase the 
fabric in bulk so, I offered him best rates and he 
purchased one roll/THAAN of fabric. And said that 
he is purchasing this fabric as a sample and if it is 
found suitable then he will purchase huge quantity 
of fabrics. Shop owner Hamza Shahid further 
disclosed that Tanveer Irshad was used to place 
order 
regarding 
the 
articles/fabrics 
through 
whatsapp number 0307-9594276. On 21.08.2021, 
Tanveer Irshad asked about the placed order 
through his whatsapp number then it was replied to 
him that his order of fabrics is ready and he can 
take it on 23.08.2021. on 23.08.2021 Tanveer 
Irshad came on Auto Rickshaw at about 
12:00/01:00 P.M (day), 06/six Thaan/cartons were 
already loaded in the rickshaw which he placed at 
my shop and requested that he is in hurry so he is 
going to load articles/36 thaans of fabrics along 
with this 06 thaans/fabrics and then he shall load 
them in the pickup/vehicle of representator of AS 
Global Logistic company thereafter Tanveer Irshad 
made complete payment in cash and went away. On 
arrival of pickup from the office of AS Global 
Logistic Company 42 carton of fabrics (36 
purchased from my shop and 06/six brought by 
Tanveer Irshad on rickshaw) were loaded in the 
said van as per instructions of Tanveer Irshad.  
During cross-examination, Muhammad Usman Ayub S.I. (PW-3)-the 
complainant-the investigating officer deposed as under: - 

Crl. Appeal No.51188 of 2022 
5 
“No narcotic was recovered from the personal 
search, on the pointation of the accused or on the 
disclosure of the accused. PW volunteered that 
narcotics was recovered from the consignment and 
accused was present at airport at relevant time. It is 
correct that company of the Shuja ul Haq Malik 
was not the owner of the consignment but his 
company was only dealing with the forwarding of 
the consignment. It is correct that as per my 
investigation Shuja ul Haq Malik was not aware 
from the fact of the presence of narcotics in the 
consignment. As per my investigation the company 
of the accused has no previous criminal record. ----
------- It is correct that the thaan of fabric from 
which 
the 
narcotics 
was 
recovered, 
transported/loaded from the shop of Hamza Shahid 
(Muskan Fabrics Anarkali) to the office of AS 
Global Logistic Network Pvt. Ltd for further 
forwarding the same. It is correct that as per 
statement 
of 
Hamza 
Shahid 
said 
06/six 
Thaans/rolls were delivered at the shop of Hamza 
Shahid by Tanveer Irshad.” (Underline for 
emphasis) 
In the similar manner, Muhammad Sohail/C (PW-4)-the recovery witness 
deposed in his examination-in-chief. During cross-examination, Muhammad 
Sohail/C (PW-4) deposed as under: - 
“It is correct that the accused Shuja ul Haq Malik 
helped out the I.O to trace the actual culprit of this 
case during investigation. It is correct that accused 
Shuja ul Haq Malik submitted the documents 
related to the accused Tanveer Irshad to 
Muhammad Usman Ayyub/S.I (I.O of this case). It 
is correct that accused Shuja ul Haq Malik 
submitted a DVD of conversation (recorded on 
whatsapp) between the accused Shuja ul Haq 
Malik and Tanveer Irshad and also submitted the 
previous GDs of the consignment related to 
Tanveer Irshad. It is correct that accused Shuja ul 
Haq Malik on call appeared at AIIAP at the place 
of occurrence.” 
 
 
Admittedly, the prosecution witnesses, i.e., Muhammad Usman 
Ayub S.I. (PW-3)-the complainant-the investigating officer, and Muhammad 
Sohail/C (PW-4), made a statement revealing that during the investigation, no 

Crl. Appeal No.51188 of 2022 
6 
connection of the appellant was found with Tanveer Irshad or he was aware 
of the presence of any narcotics substance concealed in the consignment. 
These witnesses have not supported the prosecution version. Admittedly, in 
the presence of the Prosecutor for ANF, the statements of the witnesses, i.e., 
Muhammad Usman Ayub S.I. (PW-3)-the complainant-the investigating 
officer, and Muhammad Sohail/C (PW-4), were recorded, and these witnesses 
were not declared hostile by the learned trial court. Section 150 of Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984 does not in terms or by necessary implication confine 
the exercise of the power by the Court to any particular stage of the 
examination of the witness to permit the person who calls a witness to put any 
question to him which might be put in cross-examination by the adverse 
party. It is wide in scope, and the discretion is entirely left to the Court to 
exercise power when the circumstances demand. To confine this power to the 
stage of examination-in-chief is to make it ineffective in practice. Muhammad 
Usman Ayub S.I. (PW-3)-the complainant-the investigating officer in his 
examination-in-chief, also stated that Hamza Shahid (PW-8) disclosed 
himself as an owner of Muskan Fabrics and said that Tanveer Irshad was one 
of his customers, who came/visited first time at his shop 8/9 month before, he 
asked/inquired about the rates of the cloth and said that he would purchase the 
fabric in bulk so, I offered him best rates. He bought one roll/THAAN of 
fabric. Tanveer Irshad came by Auto Rickshaw at about 12:00/01:00 P.M 
(day); 06/six Thaan/cartons were already loaded in the rickshaw, which he 
placed at my shop and requested that he was in hurry so he was going to load 
articles/36 thaans of fabrics along with this 06 thaans/fabrics and then he 
would load them in the pickup/vehicle of representator of AS Global Logistic 
company thereafter Tanveer Irshad made complete payment in cash and went 
away. The flow of the examination-in-chief reveals that during the 
investigation, the appellant cooperates with the investigating agency, and one 
Tanveer Irshad (Fake name) brought 06 thaans/fabrics, which were loaded in 
the pickup/vehicle of a representative of AS Global Logistic company and 
Tanveer Irshad made complete payment in cash and went away. Hamza 
Shahid (PW-8) also deposed similarly. A  smart witness in his examination-

Crl. Appeal No.51188 of 2022 
7 
in-chief faithfully conforms to what he stated earlier to the police, but in the 
cross-examination, he introduces statements contradicting what he said in the 
examination-in-chief. In the instant case, the evidence against the appellant 
remains the same. We observed that the prosecution witnesses deposed 
similar about the appellant’s role, which was found during the investigation. 
Otherwise, if the prosecution witness’s design was obvious, we do not see 
why the trial court cannot, during the course of the prosecution witness’s 
cross-examination, permit the person calling him/them as a witness/witnesses 
to put questions to him/them which might be put cross-examination by the 
adverse party. In the course of cross-examination, when favorable answers 
had been elicited, the same would be considered by the learned trial court 
while passing the final judgment. The learned trial court, while passing the 
judgment, whereby conviction and sentence of the appellant were recorded, 
has not considered the above evidence of the prosecution witnesses. In 
addition, Umar Ijaz (PW-5), clearing agent AIIAP, Lahore, deposed during 
cross-examination, “It is correct that I received the complete documents 
related to the consignment. I was not advised by anyone to jump over 
any step in the clearing procedure. The consignment was a console 
consignment, which comprised upon the articles related to the different 
parties.” Ghulam Nabi (PW-6)-the owner of Awais Fancy embroidery, 
Lahore, through his examination in chief stated that E-Form numbers 
MBL2021-56615, MBL2021-56620, MBL2021-56617, which were attached 
with the consignment, were not in his knowledge and he had no concern with 
them. He has no article in the said consignment, and by taking summersault, 
he (PW-6) stated that the appellant used his documents without permission. 
During cross-examination, he (PW-6) deposed that, “In routine the 
documents for clearing any consignment are usually signed by my 
staff/employees. Whenever it is requested by AS Global Logistic Network 
(Pvt) Ltd, I sent my relevant employee to sign the document for further 
proceedings in respective export of consignment.” He (PW-6) admitted 
that in so many times in the export issues, he handed over all the documents 
in advance for clearance purposes. Whenever AS Global Logistic Network 

Crl. Appeal No.51188 of 2022 
8 
requested for issuance of any E-Form for authority, the appellant, before 
using the password of Weboc, sent/CC to me via email a letter of request 
along with relevant documents. The admission of Ghulam Nabi (PW-6) that 
any E-Form for authority cannot be used or downloaded without a password 
reveals that the witness (PW-6) gave his password to the appellant for using 
the same. It is admitted fact that during the investigation, the investigating 
officer has not sent the relevant documents, i.e., E-Form numbers MBL2021-
56615, MBL2021-56620, MBL2021-56617 for comparison with the 
signatures of Ghulam Nabi (PW-6) to connect the appellant for preparing 
forged and fictitious documents. On the other hand, the owner of Muskan 
Fabrics, i.e., Hamza Shahid (PW-8), deposed during cross-examination that, 
“I did not prepare any separate inventory for the six thaan which were 
not purchased from my shop. It is correct that I did not mark the 6 
thaans which were not purchased from my shop. It is correct that a 
common person cannot get separate the 6 thaan from the rest of 36 thaan 
which were purchased from my shop. It is correct that previously I 
dispatched different articles on behalf of the Tanveer Irshad in the past. 
PW volunteered that in the previous situation he was used to purchase 
cloth but not ever off loaded his articles from the wagon at my shop. It is 
incorrect to suggest that my volunteered statement is false and 
afterthought. The CCTV footage viewed by the ANF officials was not 
showing the presence of Tanveer Irshad. The registration of rickshaw 
number was also not reflected on that footage. The thans were off loaded 
by my servant from the rickshaw. It is correct that I did not show any 
piece of evidence before the ANF official to the effect that 6 thaans were 
delivered by someone else at my shop. It is correct that I signed the 
delivery of 42 thaans from my shop when a person of Global Courier 
Service arrived at my shop. PW volunteered that 36 thaans were 
purchased from my shop while the 6 were placed on my shop by Tanveer 
Irshad.” In the present case, the prosecution has badly failed to establish that 
the appellant associated, facilitated, and abetted in booking parcels by using 
fake documents (edited I.D. card of one, namely Tanveer Irshad) vide airway 

Crl. Appeal No.51188 of 2022 
9 
bill No.235-2185-4302 for the U.K from New Jerry Denata Cargo Shed, 
Allama Iqbal International Airport, Lahore. But despite the same, the learned 
Judge recorded findings holding the appellant guilty for the offense charged 
with placing strong reliance on the perception. The method adopted by the 
learned Judge is not in conformity with the settled principles of burden in 
proof of criminal jurisdiction. Hence, this court has no hesitation in holding 
that the findings recorded by the learned Judge suffer from legal infirmity and 
are liable to be set aside in the light of the evidence available on the record, 
especially the admission made by the PW-3 the investigating officer that the 
appellant was not aware of the presence of the narcotics substance in the 
consignment. In the instant matter, the prosecution did not choose to assail 
the appellant’s acquittal from the charge under Sections 420, 468, and 471 
PPC. There is no acceptable evidence before the Court. Hence, the 
prosecution miserably failed to establish the appellant’s guilt under section 9-
C of The Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997; accordingly, the 
appellant deserves to be given the benefit of the doubt, and findings in this 
regard are required to be set aside, and the same are set aside.  
7.  
 
Given the above, instant appeal bearing Crl. Appeal No.51188 of 
2022 is accepted, and Shuja ul Haq Malik, the appellant, is ordered to be 
acquitted of the charge in case FIR No.79 of 2021, dated 25.08.2021, offence 
under Section 9 (C) of The Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 and 
offenses under Sections 420, 468, 471 PPC, registered at Police Station, 
A.N.F Lahore. He (the appellant) is directed to be released forthwith if not 
required in any other criminal case.
