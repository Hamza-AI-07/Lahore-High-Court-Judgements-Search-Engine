AALIA NEELUM, J:- 
The 
appellant-Muhammad 
Rafique, son of Muhammad Hussain, caste Faqeer, resident of Peeruwala, 
Tehsil & District Kasur, has assailed his conviction and sentence recorded 
by the learned Additional Sessions Judge/GBVC, District Kasur vide 
judgment dated 12.11.20210 in case FIR No.515/2019 dated 11.08.2019, 
registered under section 376 (iii) PPC, at Police Station Saddar, District 
Kasur, whereby the learned trial court convicted the appellant-Muhammad 
Rafique under Section 376(iii) PPC and sentenced to Death, with the 
direction to pay fine of Rs.1,00,000/- and in case of default thereof, to 
undergo 06-months S.I further. The appellant was also directed to pay 
compensation of Rs.2,00,000/- to the complainant in terms of section 544-A 
of Cr.P.C. and, in case of its non-payment, to undergo 06-months S.I further.  
2. 
 
Feeling aggrieved by the judgment of the trial court, 
Muhammad Rafique, the appellant, has assailed his conviction by filing the 
instant jail appeal bearing Criminal Appeal No.67706-J of 2020. The trial 

Capital Sentence Reference No.13-T of 2020 
& Crl. Appeal No.67706-J of 2020 
 
2
court also referred C.S.R. No.13-T of 2020 (The State. Vs. Muhammad 
Rafique) for confirmation of the death sentence awarded to the appellant-
Muhammad Rafique. The matters arising from the same judgment of the 
learned trial court are being disposed of through a single judgment. 
3. 
 
The prosecution story as alleged in the F.I.R. (Ex. PC/1) lodged 
on the application (Ex.PC) of Abdul Majeed (PW-3)-the complainant is that 
on 10.08.2019 at about 07:00 p.m., Muhammad Rafique (the appellant), 
came to the house of the complainant and took his minor daughter, namely, 
Zunaira Fatima, aged about 11 months with him. When the appellant did not 
bring back the minor, the complainant (PW-3), alongwith Muhammad Sadiq 
(PW-4) and Allah Wasaya (given up PW), went in search of the child; they 
heard the voice of cries of the infant from the nearby agricultural fields, 
where they witnessed the appellant while committing rape with minor; on 
seeing them, the appellant fled away from the spot, whereas the minor was 
smeared with blood. The complainant (PW-3) took the child, Zunaira 
Fatima, 
to 
DHQ 
Hospital, 
Kasur, 
where 
she 
was 
medically 
treated/examined. After that, the case was registered.   
4. 
 
After the occurrence, the appellant was arrested, and having 
found the accused/appellant guilty, the Investigating Officer prepared a 
report under Section 173, Cr.P.C. while placing the names of the accused in 
column No.3 of the Challan and sent the same to the court of competent 
jurisdiction. On 03.02.2020, the trial court formally charge-sheeted the 
appellant, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In support of its 
version, the prosecution produced as many as six (06) witnesses.  
5. 
 
After recording evidence and evaluating the evidence available 
on record in light of arguments advanced from both sides, the trial court 
found the prosecution version proved beyond any shadow of reasonable 
doubt, which resulted in the appellant's conviction in the aforestated terms.  
6. 
 
We have given our anxious and most thoughtful consideration 
to the rival submissions of both sides and have minutely gone through the 
evidence on record.

7. 
 
The prosecution’s case is based on the testimonies of Abdul 
Majeed (PW-3)-the complainant (father of infant Zunaira Fatima, aged about 
11 months at the time of the incident), and Muhammad Sadiq (PW-4), 
nephew of the complainant. Per the prosecution case, the incident occurred 
on 10.08.2019 at 07:00 p.m. in the village Peeruwala, District Kasur, falling 
within the jurisdiction of Police Station Saddar, Kasur. The Police Station is 
at a distance of 03 kilometers away from the place of occurrence, and the 
matter was reported to the police on 11.08.2019 at 07:30 a.m. by Abdul 
Majeed (PW-3)-the complainant through the written complaint (Ex. PC) 
wherein the name of the appellant duly figures as main stalwart of the 
occurrence, for committing rape with the daughter of Abdul Majeed (PW-3)-
the complainant, Zunaira Fatima, aged about 11 months. According to Abdul 
Majeed (PW-3)-the complainant, he has three children. Among them, 
Zunaira Fatima is a one-year-old minor. The accused/appellant, a next-door 
neighbor of the complainant, often used to take out his children to play. On 
10.08.2019 at 07:00 p.m., the accused/appellant came to his house and took 
his minor daughter, Zunaira Fatima, outside the home. When the 
accused/appellant did not bring the minor back for some time, the 
complainant (PW-3), alongwith Muhammad Sadiq (PW-4) and Allah 
Wasaya (given up PW), went in search of the minor; they heard the minor's 
cries that were coming from the fields; they went to the fields and saw the 
accused/appellant was committing rape with the minor; on seeing them, the 
accused/appellant fled away from the spot. Whereas, the minor was smeared 
with blood. The complainant (PW-3) took the minor, Zunaira Fatima, to 
DHQ Hospital, Kasur, where she was medically treated/examined. 
Afterward, the complainant, Abdul Majeed (PW-3), reported the incident to 
the police. Both the prosecution witnesses, i.e., Abdul Majeed (PW-3)-the 
complainant, and Muhammad Sadiq (PW-4)-the eye witness, in their court 
statements, reiterated their statements made in the FIR as well as before the 
police and faced cross-examination conducted by the defence. The defence, 
through cross-examination, reaffirmed the genesis, mode, manner, and place 
of occurrence. Abdul Majeed (PW-3)-the complainant deposed during cross-
examination that:-

& Crl. Appeal No.67706-J of 2020

“On the day of alleged occurrence, both of said 
PWs came to my house at 6:00 pm to see me in 
routine. Said PWs used to visit my house after 
3/4 days in routine. Till registration of the FIR, 
both of said PWs remained with me. They also 
accompanied me to the hospital and also spent 
the night there. We straight away took the 
alleged victim/minor Zunaira Fatima to the 
hospital from the place of occurrence soon 
after. 
----------------------------The 
agricultural 
fields of Ashraf Kamboh, where the alleged 
occurrence took place, is towards East from my 
house, at the distance of about 4 Kanals. No 
residential house falls on the way from my 
house to the place of occurrence. We saw the 
accused with infant/victim about 10 steps into 
the crop. It was maize crop about 4 feet high at 
that time. House of Rafique accused is parallel 
to my house. --------------------------------------------
------------I went to the police station at about 
7:30 am in the following morning and got 
drafted the complaint Ex. PC from a person, 
sitting outside the police station and then got 
the case registered. From the police station, I 
alongwith aforesaid PWs went to the hospital. 
The Thanedar visited the place of occurrence at 
about 11:00/12:00 noon on that day.---------------
----------------At the time of occurrence, my wife 
was also in my house. She also saw the infant 
Zunaira Fatima after the occurrence, when we 
brought her from the place of occurrence. I 
produced the blood stained clothes of the victim 
to the Thanedar at the hospital, in the evening 
on 11.08.2019 and other PWs were not with me 
at that time.” 
Similarly, Muhammad Sadiq (PW-4), the eye witness, deposed during cross-
examination and reaffirmed his presence in the complainant's house and the 
mode and manner of the incident. He (PW-4) deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“I use to visit house of the complainant, after 5 
to 10 days in routine, who is my Chacha. On the 
day of alleged occurrence, we reached at the 
house of complainant at about 6:00 pm, to see 
him. Allah Wasaya PW also uses to visit the 
house of complainant like me. I alongwith Allah 
Wasaya went together to the house of

& Crl. Appeal No.67706-J of 2020

complainant. Accused Rafique took the infant 
Zunaira Fatima with him in our presence, who 
in routine used to do so. We worried on that 
day, for the reason that the accused did not 
come back as per his usual routine of five or ten 
minutes. The accused used to take the children 
with him for the last one year of the occurrence. 
When we came out of house of the complainant, 
the complainant knocked at the door of accused 
Rafique and his father told he was not at home, 
then we looked here and there around and 
thereafter, we went toward the maize crop. We 
went towards the maize crop together. -----------
------------- From the place of occurrence, we 
took the infant Zunaira Fatima to the hospital 
by motorcycle. We reached the hospital within 
20 minutes. It was daylight at the time of 
occurrence. it was Maghrib prayer time, when 
we reached hospital. The complainant and 
other PW Allah Wasaya were also with me 
when we reached the hospital and we were on 
two motorcycles. We remained at the hospital 
for whole night. In the following morning, I 
accompanied the complainant to the police 
station. We got the complaint drafted from 
outside of the police station and it was about 
7:30 am. The doctor removed the blood stained 
clothes of the infant Zunaira Fatima. The infant 
Zunaira was medically examined in between 
10:00/11:00 pm, on the same day. ------------------
------ The doctor first time attended infant 
Zunaira Fatima within 15/20 minutes of our 
arrival at the hospital. She was medically 
examined for legal purpose thereafter. On the 
following day, we again went to the hospital 
from the police station after filling the 
application. ---------------- The Thanedar also 
accompanied us to the hospital, after his visit of 
the crime scene. The Thanedar observed the 
infant/victim. The Thanedar did not interrogate 
us at the hospital. We had MLC of the 
infant/victim with us when we went to the police 
station in the following of the occurrence. the 
complainant received the MLC from the doctor 
and handed over to the police. The complainant 
also delivered the blood stained clothes of the 
infant/victim Zunaira Fatima to the Thanedar, 
at the time when we went to the police station 
for getting the case registered.”

The above-said deposition of the prosecution witnesses reveals that Abdul 
Majeed (PW-3)-the complainant, and Muhammad Sadiq (PW-4)-the eye 
witness, fully supported each other on material points and proved the 
manner of occurrence. The argument of the learned counsel for the appellant 
that per the medico-legal certificate of Zunaira Fatima, she was medically 
examined by police, and it negates the prosecution case that after the 
occurrence, they took Zunaira Fatima to the hospital for medical 
examination has no force. The defence itself brought on the record that 
Zunaira Fatima was brought for medical examination by her parents in the 
company of a lady constable, and a docket was issued by the Front Desk 
established in DHQ Hospital. On perusal of the injury statement (Ex.PE), it 
reveals that the same was issued by the In-charge Police Khidmat Counter, 
DHQ Kasur, and it was mentioned that the father of the child stated that she 
was raped. Dr. Ayesha Batool (PW-2) deposed during cross-examination 
that: -  
“The alleged victim Zunaira Fatima was 
brought to the hospital by her parents, in 
company of lady constable Zaib-un-Nisa. There 
was no application of the Investigating Officer 
for medical examination of the alleged victim 
but at the Front Desk, in DHQ hospital, Kasur, 
the docket was issued. The docket was issued by 
the police official, present on duty on at that 
time on Front Desk. The docket is part of the 
record as Ex.PE. Lady constable Zaib-un-Nisa 
was on the Front Desk/Khidmat Centre. It is 
correct that the docket, Ex.PE, speaks that the 
victim Zunaira Fatima was not medically 
examined prior to that.” 
In view of the above, it is a fact that the accused had victimized an infant 
aged about 11 months. In the traditional, non-permissive bounds of our 
society, no parent of a minor or girl or woman of self-respect and dignity 
would depose falsely implicating somebody of ravishing her chastity by 
sacrificing and jeopardizing her future and would they be sacrificing her 
future. It is not the law that, in every case, a version of the complainant or 
victim must be corroborated in material particulars by independent evidence 
on record. Rape is an offence that is violative of the fundamental right of 

Capital Sentence Reference No.13-T of 2020 
& Crl. Appeal No.67706-J of 2020 
 
7
every person. Sexual violence, apart from being a dehumanizing act, is an 
unlawful intrusion on the right of privacy and sanctity of a female. It is a 
serious blow to the victim's honor and offends her self-esteem and dignity, 
and it degrades and humiliates the victim, where the victim is a helpless, 
innocent child or a minor. It leaves behind a traumatic experience. A perusal 
of the record available on file reveals that both of the prosecution witnesses 
remained consistent on salient features of the prosecution version, 
particularly about the manner of the incident, hearing the noise of voice from 
fields, and after that, witnessing the mode and manner in which the appellant 
had committed the incident, after that his fleeing away from the place of 
occurrence. The prosecution witnesses' deposition is straightforward, 
confidence-inspiring, and appeals to reason. The fact also remains that 
despite lengthy cross-examination, the defence could not create any serious 
crack going to the roots of the case.   
8. 
 
The medical evidence also supports the oral evidence. Dr. 
Ayesha Batool (PW-2), who medically examined the infant/victim, Zunaira 
Fatima, has observed the following: - 
“EXAMINATION OF CLOTHES  
At the time of examination, the clothes of the 
minor victim were changed, and the clothes the 
victim was wearing were blood-stained. 
GENERAL AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  
Zunaira was conscious and was crying. There was 
no bruise or sign of injury at any party of the body 
of the victim. 
VAGINAL EXAMINATION  
Hymen was freshly ruptured. In the posterior 
forchette of the vagina, a tear of 0.5 cm was found 
present, which was actively bleeding. 
OPINION  
In my opinion, fresh attempt of sexual assault was 
done to the baby victim, as hymen was found fresh 
ruptured, and there was also tear of 0.5 cm in the 
vagina.” 
Dr. Ayesha Batool (PW-2) deposed during cross-examination that: -  

Capital Sentence Reference No.13-T of 2020 
& Crl. Appeal No.67706-J of 2020 
 
8
“I observed in the MLC, Ex.PE, that fresh 
attempt of sexual assault had been done with 
the victim, as there was fresh rupture of the 
hymen. By this I meant that the sexual act had 
been performed with the infant Zunaira 
Fatima. I do not understand in legal sense the 
meaning of attempt.” 
The above deposition of Dr. Ayesha Batool (PW-2) reveals that it was not 
the case of an attempt or vaginal injuries might be the result of the 
penetrating of some other object. Instead, she (PW-2) stated in reply to the 
specific question that a sexual act had been performed with the infant 
Zunaira Fatima. The Hymen was freshly ruptured. In the posterior fourchette 
of the vagina, there was a tear of 0.5 cm with active bleeding. In fact, the 
medical examination report (Ex. PE) of the victim held on 10.08.2019 at 
10:10 p.m. with the incident occurring on 10.08.2019 at 07:00 p.m. has 
established the penetrative sexual assault on the victim. Exhibit-PE has 
corroborated the deposition of Abdul Majeed (PW-3)-the complainant, and 
Muhammad Sadiq (PW-4)-the eye witness on the factum of penetrative 
sexual assault on the victim. The evidence on record suggests that there was 
penetrative sexual assault by the appellant on the victim. The appellant has 
not drawn our attention to any material on record to suggest otherwise. The 
contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that no seminal material 
was found in the vaginal swabs of the victim makes the case of the appellant 
of attempt, is misconceived. The medical examination report (Ex. PE) of the 
victim reveals that the minor was medically examined by Dr. Ayesha Batool 
(PW-2) at 10:10 p.m. on 10.08.2019, whereas the occurrence took place at 
07:00 p.m. and that clothes of the minor aged about 11 months were changed 
and changed clothes too were bloodstained. It is pertinent to mention here 
that the infant's body area of genitals requires cleaning, when becomes wet 
and dirty. Besides, Dr. Ayesha Batool (PW-2) handed over vaginal swabs to 
lady constable Zaib-un-Nisa (not cited as a witness), but the same was not 
secured as per SOPs. Tariq Mehmood S.I. (dismissed from service) (PW-5)-
the investigating officer deposed during cross-examination that: 
“I received the MLC of the victim Zunaira from 
the doctor, formally. The first treatment notes, 

Capital Sentence Reference No.13-T of 2020 
& Crl. Appeal No.67706-J of 2020 
 
9
dated 10.08.2019, of the victim were also 
handed over to me by the doctor. Parents of the 
victim shifted him to the hospital. I infact, 
received the MLC at about 1:00 p.m on 
11.08.2019 from the constable, deputed at the 
Front Desk in the Hospital. I did not ask from 
the lady constable when she received the MLC 
from the doctor. I received the MLC as well as 
first treatment notes at the same time from the 
lady constable, at the Front Desk. I cannot tell 
the time when the victim Zunaira was first 
treated by the doctor after the occurrence.” 
The lapse of time between the time of the incident, the time of preparation of 
the parcel of vaginal swabs, and the date and time on which vaginal swabs 
were received is a relevant factor. The DNA report (Ex. PG) has to be read 
in the context of the collection of parcel of vaginal swabs by Tariq 
Mehmood S.I. (dismissed from service) (PW-5)-the investigating officer. 
The DNA report (Ex. PG) cannot be held to have raised a fair doubt based 
on reason and common sense. The accused has taken a plea that he has been 
falsely implicated in this case. The accused, during cross-examination, put 
his defence to Abdul Majeed (PW-3)-the complainant, as follows: - 
“It is incorrect to suggest that at the instance of 
my wife, Rafique accused was implicated in this 
case, as the accused did not assent to develop 
sexual relations with my wife. It is further 
incorrect to suggest that due to said grudge my 
wife told me false story and then we got the case 
registered.” 
 
 
At the end of the cross-examination, suggestions were put to the 
complainant (PW-3). Similar suggestions were made to Muhammad Sadiq 
(PW-4). The result of the discussion above is that the defence plea of the 
accused has no legs to stand. In support of his defence, he has not examined 
any witnesses. The accused improved its defense plea in the statement u/s 
342 Cr.P.C., to the extent, “That offer was flatly refused by me and I about 
to leave when she attracted me and thrust her finger into the vagina of minor 
Zunaira after that victim cried and the blood started oozing.” The accused, to 
substantiate his plea put the suggestion to Muhammad Anwar ASI (PW-6), 
the subscriber of FIR, that mother of infant Zunaira had injured her by 

Capital Sentence Reference No.13-T of 2020 
& Crl. Appeal No.67706-J of 2020 
 
10
inserting her finger in her vagina. Muhammad Anwar ASI (PW-6) denied 
the suggestions and negated the defence plea during cross-examination and 
deposed that: -  
“It is incorrect to suggest that accused Rafique 
stated before me in evening of 10.08.2019 that 
mother of infant Zunaira had injured her by 
inserting finger in her vagina and blood was 
oozing. It is incorrect to suggest that accused 
Rafique was arrested at that time by us and 
then fabricated the facts of prosecution case.” 
 
 
It is pertinent to note that the accused brought no evidence 
supporting the improved stand. Resultantly, the testimony of Abdul Majeed 
(PW-3)-the complainant, and Muhammad Sadiq (PW-4)-the eyewitness, 
prevails over the bald averment of the accused under Section 342 Cr.P.C.  
On the other hand, the testimony of Abdul Majeed (PW-3)-the complainant, 
and Muhammad Sadiq (PW-4)-the eyewitness, cannot be brushed aside on 
the flimsy plea raised by the accused. Given the settled legal proposition, the 
testimony of Abdul Majeed (PW-3)-the complainant, and Muhammad Sadiq 
(PW-4)-the eye witness, is sufficient to bring home the guilt of the accused, 
which, in the instant case, finds corroboration from the medical evidence. As 
such, the learned trial Court rightly convicted the appellant by holding that 
the prosecution had succeeded in establishing its case beyond reasonable 
doubt. 
9. 
 
Given the above circumstances, we have concluded that the 
prosecution has proven its case against the appellant, Muhammad Rafique, 
beyond any doubt. However, the factors that have persuaded us not to 
uphold the capital sentence of the appellant are the negative DNA report and 
the appellant's age at the time of the incident. As the appellant has been 
convicted and sentenced to death, the same can be considered a mitigating 
circumstance in such an eventuality. Based on the grounds discussed 
hereinabove, we believe that mitigating circumstances exist about the 
quantum of the appellant’s sentence. Therefore, we believe the death 
sentence awarded to the appellant is quite harsh. The well-recognized 

Capital Sentence Reference No.13-T of 2020 
& Crl. Appeal No.67706-J of 2020 
 
11
principle is that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt as an 
extenuating circumstance while deciding his question sentence.  
10. 
 
In these circumstances, the appeal bearing No.67706-J of 
2020, filed by the appellant, Muhammad Rafique, son of Muhammad 
Hussain, in case FIR No.515/2019, under section 376(iii) P.P.C, Police 
Station Saddar Kasur, District Kasur is dismissed. However, his (the 
appellant’s) death sentence is converted into imprisonment for life. The 
benefit of Section 382(b) of Cr.P.C is also extended to the appellant. The 
compensation and acceptable amount and sentence qua non-payment of the 
compensation and fine amount imposed by the trial court shall remain intact 
upon the appellant (convict).  
11. 
 
Capital Sentence Reference No.13-T of 2020, forwarded by 
the learned trial court for confirmation of the sentence of death inflicted 
upon the convict fails, which is answered in Negative.
