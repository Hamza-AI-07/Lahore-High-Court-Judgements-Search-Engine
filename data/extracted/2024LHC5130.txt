ZEESHAN ASGHAR 
versus 
PROVINCE OF THE PUNJAB and others  
 
JUDGMENT 
Date of hearing: 
 
10.10.2024 
Petitioner by: 
Malik Muhammad Awais Khalid, 
Advocate. 
Respondent  No.1 by: 
Malik Amjad Ali, Additional 
Advocate General, Punjab. 
Respondents No.2 to 5 by: M/s Ali Akbar Javed Naqvi and 
Muhammad 
Mohkam 
Bajwa, 
Advocates. 
 
MIRZA VIQAS RAUF, J. The petitioner namely Zeeshan 
Asghar was appointed as Junior Clerk in the Cadet College, 
Hasanabdal (hereinafter referred to as “College”) on 01st September, 
2004, being the son of ex-employee, who died during service. The 
petitioner after completion of probation period was ultimately 
regularized as permanent employee. The petitioner on account of 
enhanced qualification was later-on posted as Junior Accountant 
vide order dated 18th October, 2007. To dismay of the petitioner, he 
was served with a show cause notice dated 27th February, 2021 and 
was finally confronted with a penalty of “compulsory retirement 
from service” w.e.f. 13th March, 2021 by way of order dated 05th 
March, 2021. Feeling aggrieved, the petitioner preferred a 
departmental appeal but it was dismissed vide order dated 17th 

Writ Petition No.1465 of 2023 
 
-2- 
 
March, 2022. This followed a review petition before respondent 
No.3 but that too was dismissed through order dated 08th April, 2023, 
which is now impugned in this petition under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. 
2.  
In the light of the grounds, canvassed in this petition, it was 
admitted for regular hearing by way of order dated 27th April, 2023 
and a notice was issued to the respondents, in response whereof, 
written statement was filed by respondents No.2 to 5, wherein it is 
asserted that throughout his career, the petitioner remained 
troublemaker and despite numerous warnings, he did not mend his 
ways. In written statement, the respondents have defended the 
infliction of major penalty upon the petitioner. 
3.  
Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the show 
cause notice is not only lacking any legal backing but it does not 
specify the allegations at all. Learned counsel contended that the 
petitioner has been proceeded departmentally on the basis of 
previous record, which amounts to double jeopardy. It is argued with 
vehemence that though the petitioner has been inflicted with major 
penalty but no regular inquiry was held. Learned counsel emphasized 
that the proceedings culminated into imposition of major penalty are 
not only violative of principle of audi alteram partem but offends the 
mandate of Article 10A of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic 
of Pakistan, 1973. Learned counsel argued emphatically that the 
impugned orders are patently illegal and unlawful. In support of his 
contentions, learned counsel has placed reliance on SANAULLAH 
SANI versus SECRETARY EDUCATION SCHOOLS and others 
(2024 SCMR 80) and FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through 
Chairman Federal Board of Revenue FBR House, Islamabad and 
others versus Zahid Malik (2023 SCMR 603). 
4.  
Conversely, learned counsel representing the “College”, while 
defending  the impugned orders, submitted that show cause notice 
was well-founded and prior to the show cause notice, a detailed 
inquiry was conducted but the petitioner has failed to rebut the 

Writ Petition No.1465 of 2023 
 
-3- 
 
allegations against him. Learned counsel submitted that throughout 
his career, the petitioner remained indolent and he was issued various 
warnings and penalties. It is contended by learned counsel for the 
“College” that the petitioner is estopped by his words and conduct to 
file constitutional petition as he has already received certain 
pensionary benefits after his compulsory retirement. Placed reliance 
on Raja MUHAMMAD SHAHID versus The INSPECTOR 
GENERAL OF POLICE and others (2023 SCMR 1135).  
5.  
Arguments heard, record perused. 
6.  
Before delving into the merits of the case, it would be apposite 
to mention here that the “College” is the first Cadet College in 
Pakistan which was established by the Punjab Government to serve 
as feeder institution to the services academies. In order to establish 
Boards of Governors for government educational and training 
institutions in the Punjab for the efficient management and control 
thereunder, Governor of the West Pakistan was pleased to 
promulgate “The Punjab Government Educational and Training 
Institutions Ordinance, 1960 (hereinafter referred to as “Ordinance, 
1960”). In terms whereof, the government created Board of 
Governors to exercise administrative control over the colleges and in 
terms of Section 3 of the “Ordinance, 1960”, the Board was designed 
as a body corporate. By virtue of Section 18 of the “Ordinance, 
1960”, Board was vested with the power to frame regulations not 
inconsistent with the provisions of the Ordinance and the rules made 
thereunder with the approval of the government, to carry out the 
purpose of the Ordinance. 
7.  
In exercise of powers conferred on it by Clause (e) of 
Sub-Section (2) of Section 18 of the “Ordinance, 1960”, Board of 
Governors was pleased to frame, with the approval of the 
Government of the Punjab, “Cadet College Hasanabdal (General 
Conditions of Service) Regulations so as to regulate the matters 
relating to the service of its employees. In furtherance “Cadet 
College, 
Hasanabdal 
Employees’ 
Efficiency 
&

-4- 
 
Regulations (hereinafter referred to as “E & D Regulations”) were 
also framed. Regulation 3 deals with penalties, whereas regulation 5 
prescribes procedure for inquiry in case of inefficiency, misconduct 
and corruption. 
8.  
The petitioner was appointed as Junior Clerk, being the son of 
ex-employee of the “College”, who died during service on 08th 
August, 2004. The petitioner remained in service for about 17-years 
when he was confronted with show cause notice dated 27th February, 
2021 to the following effect:- 
 
 
 
“Subject SHOW CAUSE NOTICE 
1.  
A detailed enquiry was recently ordered vide Office Order No 2/1754 dated 
31st December 2020 to probe the reported malpractice, misuse and fuel pilferage of 
College Transport over the recent years. During the comprehensive enquiry 
process, your involvement in one way or the other and having been revealed for 
being in coordination & support with the former Adjutant and NCOs for almost all the 
malpractices (including the issues being investigated) raises certain questions.

3. You are being issued this Show Cause Notice to explain in writing as to why a 
strict disciplinary action should not be taken against you in the light of 
recommendations made in the enquiry report, reported unsuitability for service at 
CCH and being a demoralising factor for your law-abiding fellow workers. You 
written reply should reach the undersigned by 3 Mar 2021.” 
 
9.  
As already observed that Regulation 5 of the “E & D 
Regulations” provides procedure for inquiry in cases of inefficiency, 
misconduct and corruption. For ease of reference, same is 
reproduced below:- 
5.  
Inquiry Procedure in cases of Inefficiency, Misconduct & Corruption:- 
a)  
When a college employee is to be proceeded against under Clause  (a), (b) 
or (c) of regulation 2, the procedure in the following sub-regulations shall 
be observed. 
b) 
The authority may, if he thinks fit, appoint an officer of the college to which 
the college employee belongs to examine and report on the allegation 
against him to enable the authority to decide whether a formal inquiry 
should be held. 
c) 
If the authority decides that a formal inquiry should be held it shall decide 
further whether the allegations, if established, would call for a minor or a 
major penalty. 
d)          i) 
In cases calling for a minor penalty, the authority or such officer as 
may be appointed by it in that behalf, shall frame a charge and in 
making it known to the accused shall call upon him to answer it 
within a specified time, which shall not be less than seven days 
nor more than fourteen days, and to state, together with his 
answer, whether he desires to be heard in person or to lead 
evidence in defence. 
ii) 
On receiving the answer, the authority, or the said officer, shall, if 
satisfied that there is a prima facie case and if the alleged accused 
has so desired, give him the opportunity to be heard in person and 
to lead evidence in defence, provided that the authority or the said 
officer, may, for reasons to be recoded, refuse to call a particular 
witness or to summon or admit particular evidence. 
iii) 
If the alleged accused to answer within the specified time or having 
answered fails to appear or absent himself from the proceedings, 
the authority or the said officer may proceed with the inquiry and 
record finings. 
e)          i) 
In cases calling for a major penalty the authority having power to   
impose the penalty shall frame a charge, communicate it to the 
accused together with a statement of the allegation on which it is 
based and of any other circumstances which the authority 
proposes to take into consideration when passing orders on the 
case.  
ii) 
The authority shall require the alleged accused, within a 
reasonable time, which shall not be less than seven days nor more 
than fourteen days, from the day the charge has been 
communicated to him, to put in a written defence, stating at the 
same time whether he desires to be heard in person. 

Writ Petition No.1465 of 2023 
 
-6- 
 
iii) 
If the accused so desires, or if the authority concerned so directs, 
an Inquiry Officer to be appointed under regulation-7 shall hold an 
oral inquiry at which oral evidence shall be heard as to such of the 
allegations as are not admitted, and the accused shall be entitled 
to cross examine the witness against him, to give evidence in 
person and to have such witnesses called for the defence as he 
may wish, provided that the Inquiry Officer may for reasons to be 
recorded in writing refuse to call a particular witness or to summon 
or admit particular evidence. 
iv) 
The proceedings shall contain a sufficient record of the evidence 
and the Inquiry Officer’s report to his findings and the grounds 
thereof. 
v) 
When the authority, having considered the report, has arrived at a 
provisional conclusion as to the penalty to be imposed, it shall so 
inform the accused and supply him with a copy of the report and 
call upon him to show cause within a reasonable time, which shall 
not be less than seven days & not more than fourteen days, why 
the penalty proposed should not be imposed. The authority shall 
take into consideration any cause shown by the accused before 
passing orders. 
f) 
Nothing in the preceding sub-regulation shall apply:- 
i) 
Where the accused is dismissed or removed from service or 
reduced in rank on the ground of conduct which has led to a fine 
or of sentence of imprisonment ; or 
ii) 
Where the Authority competent to dismiss or remove a person or 
to reduce him in rank is satisfied that for reasons to be recorded 
by that authority, it is not reasonably practicable to give the 
accused an opportunity of showing cause.” 
(Underlining supplied for emphasis) 
10.  
Admittedly, the petitioner was inflicted with a major penalty 
of compulsory retirement, prescribed as such in Regulation 3 (b) (iii) 
of the “E & D Regulations”. As the petitioner is confronted with 
major penalty so in ordinary circumstances, respondents were bound 
to adhere the procedure ENVISAGED in Regulation 5 (e) of the “E & D 
Regulations”. Though Clause (ii) of Regulation 5(f) authorizes the 
authority competent to dismiss or remove a person or reduce him in 
rank to dispense with the opportunity of showing cause to accused if 
it is not reasonably practicable but for the said purpose, the authority 
has to record its reasons. Admittedly, neither regular inquiry, 
whatsoever, has been conducted by the authority, nor any reasons 
have been recorded for dispensing the regular inquiry. It is apparent 
from the show cause notice that some fact-finding inquiry was 
conducted prior to its issuance, which in no way is sufficient to 
justify the dispensation of regular inquiry.

11.  
The term “Show Cause Notice” in the departmental 
proceedings can be equated with First Information Report (F.I.R.) in 
a criminal case. “Show Cause Notice” is meant to state the grounds 
for launching departmental proceedings against the employee. It is 
thus necessary that a show cause notice must be worded properly and 
in an 
unambiguous 
manner, 
stating the 
nature 
of the 
allegation(s)/charge(s) to which the accused/employee has to 
respond. In somewhat similar circumstances in the case of 
SANAULLAH SANI versus SECRETARY EDUCATION SCHOOLS 
and others (2024 SCMR 80), the Supreme Court of Pakistan has held 
as under:- 
“6. 
A conjoint reading of the various provisions of the PEEDA 
suggests that a show cause notice is not an accusation made or 
information given in abstract but an accusation made against an 
employee in respect of an act committed or omitted, cognizable 
thereunder. As such, the law intends that a show cause notice 
must conform to at least seven essential elements, and these 
include: 
(a) 
it should be in writing and should be worded appropriately;  
(b) 
it should clearly state the nature of the charge(s), date, and 
place of the commission or omission of acts, along with 
apportionment of responsibility; 
(c) 
it should clearly quote the clause of the PEEDA under 
which the delinquent is liable to be punished; 
(d) 
it should also indicate the proposed penalty in case the 
charge is proved; 
(e) 
it should specify the time and date within which the 
employee should submit his explanation in writing. It is also 
preferable to add in the show cause notice that if no written 
explanation is received from the accused within the 
prescribed date, the enquiry will be conducted ex-parte; 
(f) 
it should be issued under the signature of the competent 
authority and 
(g) 
it should contain the time, date and place of the inquiry and 
the name of the inquiry officer. 
7. 
It must be mentioned here that strict compliance of the 
above conditions is vital so that the principle of natural justice is 
not violated. It is thus emphasised that the charges made in the 
show cause notice should not be vague. All the acts of commission 
or omission constituting the charge, and also forming the ground 
for proceeding against the employee, should be clearly specified 
because otherwise, it will be difficult for an employee, even by 

Writ Petition No.1465 of 2023 
 
-8- 
 
projecting his imagination, to discover all the facts and 
circumstances that may be in the contemplation of the competent 
authority to be established against him, and thus, it will not only 
frustrate the requirement of giving him a reasonable opportunity to 
put up a defence but also amount to a violation of his fundamental 
right to a fair trial.” 
In the wake of above principles, when show cause notice is 
examined, it reflects that same is not in accord therewith. The 
petitioner has even not been confronted with any allegations/charges 
specifically except his previous conduct. Though no provision is 
cited under which show cause notice is issued but as per specific 
stance of the respondents, it is manifestly clear that the petitioner was 
proceeded under the “E & D Regulations”. Needless to reiterate that 
the procedure prescribed in the “E & D Regulations” has not been 
followed at all.  
12.  
There is yet another important aspect, the petitioner was 
awarded major penalty but without holding any regular inquiry. It is 
an oft-repeated principle of law that though it is discretionary with 
the department to dispense with the regular inquiry in the facts and 
circumstances of the case but such dispensation would be backed by 
some compelling justifiable reasons, assigned in writing, which are 
clearly lacking in the present case. The petitioner has thus been 
deprived of his vested right of fair trial as guaranteed under Articles 
4 and 10A of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973. Reference to this effect can be made to MUHAMMAD NAEEM 
AKHTAR 
versus 
MANAGING 
DIRECTOR 
WATER 
AND 
SANITATION AGENCY LDA, LAHORE and others (2017 SCMR 
356), SENIOR SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE (OPERATION) 
and others versus SHAHID NAZIR (2022 SCMR 327) and 
FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through Chairman Federal Board of 
Revenue FBR House, Islamabad and others versus ZAHID MALIK 
(2023 SCMR 603). 
13.  
In the wake of above discussion, I feel no hesitation to observe 
that the departmental proceedings, culminating into imposition of 
major penalty of “compulsory retirement from service” upon the 

Writ Petition No.1465 of 2023 
 
-9- 
 
petitioner, are fraught with patent illegalities and as such the 
order-in-original dated 05th March, 2021 as well as order of the 
appellate authority dated 17th March, 2022 and order passed in 
review dated 08th April, 2023, being illegal and unlawful are 
set-aside. As a sequel, this petition is allowed. The petitioner is 
reinstated in service subject to refund of dues received by him from 
the department within a period of one month, leaving the “College” 
to hold de novo proceedings by conducting a regular inquiry, which 
shall be completed within three months. Needless to observe that 
payment of back benefits, if any, shall also be subject to final 
outcome of the de novo departmental proceedings. There is no order 
as to costs.
