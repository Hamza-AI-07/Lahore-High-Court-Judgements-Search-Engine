Date of hearing:      
11.12.2024. 
Applicant by: 
 
Mr. Shahbaz Butt, Advocate. 
Respondents by: 
Mr. Shahid Sarwar Chahil, Advocate. 
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.- Through 
instant Reference Application under Section 47 of the Sales Tax 
Act, 1990 (“the Act of 1990”) read with Section 133(1) of the 
Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (“the Ordinance of 2001”), 
following questions of law, asserted to have arisen out of impugned 
order dated 20.08.2024, passed by learned Appellate Tribunal 
Inland Revenue, Lahore Bench, Lahore (“Appellate Tribunal”), 
have been pressed and argued for our opinion:- 
1) Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the 
case, the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue has 
failed to pass a just, fair, proper, reasoned and 
speaking order, as required under Section 24A of the 
General Clauses Act, 1897? 
If so: 
i. 
Whether such a non-speaking order is not 
sustainable in the eye of law?  
2) Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the 
case, the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue has 
erred in law and fact both, while travelling beyond the 
allegation voiced and raised in the show cause notice 
and in the sheer ignorance and disregard of the law 
laid down by Supreme court in cases reported as (i) 
2021 PTD 1392; (ii) 2023 SCMR 1856? 
3) Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the 
case, the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue was 
justified in ignoring that sales tax cannot be imposed 
firstly on the basis of presumption and without 
establishing and discharging onus to the effect that 

 
 
STR No.73619 of 2024 
 
2
alleged sales were taxable supplies amenable to 
charge of tax under Sales Tax Act, 1990 and 
secondly tax cannot be imposed merely on the basis 
of difference in sales declared in the income tax 
return and the sales recorded in sales tax return?  
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that petitioner is an Association of 
Persons (AOP). During interim scrutiny of monthly sales tax 
record, on account of certain discrepancies found in the results, 
declared by the applicant, pertaining to tax year 2022, a show cause 
notice was issued to the applicant-taxpayer, which culminated in 
passing of order-in-original dated 11.09.2023 whereof an amount of 
Rs.3,632,281/- stood recoverable along with default surcharge and 
imposition of penalty under the relevant provisions of law. The 
aforesaid order-in-original was upheld by CIR (Appeals) vide its 
order dated 16.01.2024. Being dissatisfied, applicant-taxpayer 
preferred second appeal before learned Appellate Tribunal, which 
was dismissed vide order dated 20.08.2024. Hence, instant 
Reference Application.  
3. 
Learned counsel for applicant-taxpayer submits that learned 
forums below have travelled beyond the allegation voiced and 
raised in the show cause notice in violation of the dictum of law 
laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme court in cases reported as 
Messrs Fateh Yarn (Pvt.) Ltd. Faisalabad v. Commissioner Inland 
Revenue, Faisalabad and others (2021 PTD 1392). He maintains 
that even otherwise, impugned Appellate Tribunal’s order is 
absolutely non-speaking within the contemplation of the provisions 
of Section 24-A of the General Clauses Act, 1897.  
4. 
Contrarily, learned Legal Advisor for respondent-department 
defends the impugned order by contending that learned counsel for 
applicant-taxpayer has failed to point out any illegality or legal 
infirmity therein.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused.  
6. 
The record reveals that the taxpayer was served with a show 
cause notice regarding alleged suppression or concealment in sales 

 
 
STR No.73619 of 2024 
 
3
tax records when compared to income tax records for the period 
under consideration. The stance of the learned counsel for the 
applicant-taxpayer is that the learned forums below have exceeded 
the scope of the allegations raised in the show cause notice. 
Specifically, the alleged suppression of sales for the purpose of 
sales tax was based on a single claim: that there was a difference in 
the sales declared in the Income Tax Returns and the Sales Tax 
Returns. The counsel argues that the learned forums below have 
failed to consider that the sales declared in the Sales Tax Returns 
reflect sales transacted after the taxpayer’s sales tax registration, 
whereas the sales declared in the Income Tax Return reflect sales 
conducted prior to the registration. It is contended that declarations 
made under the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, alone cannot form 
the basis for determining taxable supplies under the Sales Tax Act, 
1990, as the dynamics of the two fiscal laws are distinct from one 
another. Furthermore, unless taxable supplies are identified and the 
onus of proof is discharged by the respondent authorities, such sales 
cannot be presumed to be taxable supplies under the Sales Tax Act, 
nor can they be subjected to tax. The taxpayer asserts that the tax 
authorities should not take unilateral, arbitrary action or exceed the 
scope of the original show cause notice. 
For facility of reference, operative part of the show cause 
notice is reproduced hereunder:- 
“Whereas during interim scrutiny of monthly sales tax 
records, you, of M/s SABIR PRESS CALENDAR, Faisalabad 
bearing Sales Tax Registration No.3277876252322 have 
declared results for the tax periods mentioned below and the 
following discrepancies have been observed:- 
SALES SUPPRESSION / CONCEALMENT IN SALES TAX 
RECORDS WHEN COMPARED TO INCOME TAX 
RECORDS 
 
During comparison of monthly sales tax returns with 
income tax returns for the tax years mentioned below, it has 
been noticed that the registered person being Manufacturer / 
Importer / Exporter / Service Provider has declared less 
sales / supplies in sales tax returns. The detailed 
discrepancy is as under:-

Now, on the basis of aforesaid facts, you M/s SABIR PRESS 
CALENDAR, Faisalabad are charged with the violation of 
section 3, 6, 7, 11, 22, 23 & 26 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 
and are accordingly called upon to show cause under 
section 11(2) of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 as to why sales tax 
amounting to Rs.3632281/- may not be recovered along with 
default surcharge and penalty under section 34 and 33 of the 
Sales Tax Act, 1990 respectively.  
3. 
Initial hearing of the case has been fixed for 
06.06.2023 at 11:00 AM in the office of the undersigned 
situated at Regional Tax Office, Jail Road, Faisalabad. You 
are directed to attend the date of hearing so fixed either 
yourself or through your legal representative along with 
relevant record to defend the charges. If no one appeared or 
no written reply to the show cause notice is received within 
the stipulated time, the case will be decided ex-parte on the 
basis of the facts available on record.”  
 
7. 
Where, in response to a show cause notice, the taxpayer 
raises substantial grounds or presents significant factual aspects that 
were not covered in the initial notice, and which therefore require 
further inquiry or verification by the department, a fresh or 
supplementary show cause notice should be issued to the taxpayer 
if necessary after conducting such further inquiry. No determination 
can be made regarding these new grounds or facts unless the 
taxpayer is given the opportunity to respond to any deficiencies or 
misrepresentations found in relation thereto, with such issues 
specifically alleged in a fresh or supplementary show cause notice. 
Therefore, it would be appropriate that, instead of proceeding under 
the original show cause notice, a fresh or supplementary notice be 
issued to the taxpayer in light of the defense presented. In light of 
the grounds or facts raised in the taxpayer's defense, which were 
unknown to the tax authorities and thus not part of the original 

 
 
STR No.73619 of 2024 
 
5
show cause notice, no further action should be taken under the 
initial notice. Any adjudication on these grounds would be legally 
unsustainable, rendering the entire process redundant. Charges or 
allegations in a show cause notice must be specific; otherwise, the 
taxpayer would be prejudiced and denied the right to a fair trial. 
The adjudicating authority must confine the proceedings to the 
specific charges and allegations clearly stated in the show cause 
notice. Adjudicating a charge or allegation not addressed in the 
notice would not be legally valid. In the present case, after the 
appellant's response to the show cause notice, the new situation that 
emerged should have been addressed through a fresh show cause 
notice, but this was not done. The rationale for not exceeding the 
scope of the show cause notice is that the aggrieved party must be 
given the chance to present their case; otherwise, this would violate 
the principles of natural justice, as the aggrieved party would not 
have been aware of the new grounds or factual elements and could 
not have properly defended themselves before the concerned 
authority. Reference can be made to Commissioner Inland Revenue 
v. Messrs RYK Mills (2023 SCMR 1856), Commissioner Inland 
Revenue, Chenab Zone, RTO, Faisalabad v. Messrs Rose Food 
Industries, Faisalabad and another (2023 SCMR 2070) and 
Hyderabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (HCCI) through 
duly authorized person v. Ministry of Commerce Government of 
Pakistan through Directorate General of Trade Organization and 4 
others (PLD 2024 Islamabad 350). 
 
While dealing with similar proposition, the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court in the case of Messrs Fateh Yarn supra, observed as under:- 
“7. 
Likewise, it is an accepted fact that the allegation 
levelled against the petitioner in the notice was for the 
period ending in March 2005. However, the subsequent 
orders passed by the fora below have imposed a tax 
liability on the petitioner for the period ending in January 
2006. This Court has already held in The Collector Central 
Excise and Land Customs v. Rahm Din (1987 SCMR 
1840) that an order of adjudication passed on the basis of 
a ground not stated in the notice is 'palpably illegal and 

 
 
STR No.73619 of 2024 
 
6
void on the face of it [para 7]. We see no reason why the 
same logic should not extend to an order imposing a tax 
liability for a time period not mentioned in the notice. The 
purpose of serving a notice on a taxpayer is to notify him 
of the case against him. When such a document contains 
incomplete information it can seriously prejudice the 
taxpayer's defence. As the petitioner has undoubtedly 
been saddled with a tax liability for a period which was not 
disclosed in the notice, we exclude the said additional 
period (March, 2005 till January, 2006) from the purview of 
the impugned orders passed by the Collector and 
Collector (Appeals). Accordingly, the taxing officer shall 
recalculate the outstanding tax liability of the petitioner 
from the period December, 2001 to February, 2005.”   
 
In Ramlala v. State of U.P. and others [2023 SCC OnLine 
(All) 2479], the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad observed 
that a person must be accorded a fair chance to put up his case and 
therefore the authorities cannot traverse beyond the show cause 
notice. In Associated Switch Gears and Projects v. State of U.P. 
and others (2024:AHC:12780), the High Court of Judicature at 
Allahabad ruled that the significance of adhering to the confines of 
a show cause notice lies in upholding the rule of law and preventing 
the arbitrary exercise of powers. Any action taken by an authority 
beyond the scope defined in the notice risks transgressing the 
boundaries of legality and procedural fairness. Such overreach not 
only undermines the legitimacy of the authority but also 
compromises the rights of the individuals or entities involved, 
potentially leading to legal challenges and eroding public trust. The 
Supreme Court of India in the case of The Board of High School 
and Intermediate Education, U.P. v. Kunari Chitra Srivastava 
[(1970) 1 SCC 121] has categorically stated that the principle of 
audi alteram partem was required to be followed even if the same 
was burdensome in nature. In the said case, Justice S.M. Sikri 
observed: Principles of natural justice are to some minds 
burdensome but this price – a small price indeed – has to be paid if 
we desire a society governed by the rule of law. 
8. 
A bare perusal of the record reveals that the learned 
Appellate Tribunal has not independently addressed the material 

 
 
STR No.73619 of 2024 
 
7
aspect of the matter. As a result, the impugned order fails to meet 
the requirements of a speaking order as contemplated under Section 
24-A of the General Clauses Act, 1897. It was obligatory for the 
Appellate Tribunal to examine the case with proper application of 
mind and to provide reasons in support of the impugned order. 
However, such reasoning is conspicuously absent in this case, 
rendering the impugned order unsustainable in the eyes of the law. 
Reference can be made to Pakistan Water and Power Development 
Authority (WAPDA), WAPDA House, Lahore v. The Commissioner 
Inland Revenue and others (2022 SCMR 824).   
9. 
In view of the above, our answer to the proposed questions 
No.1 & 2 is in the affirmative and, to question No.3 is in the 
negative i.e., in favour of applicant-taxpayer and against the 
respondent-department.  
 
This  Reference Application is decided against respondent-
department.  
10. 
Office shall send a copy of this judgment under seal of the 
Court to learned Appellate Tribunal as per Section 47 (5) of the Act 
of 1990.
