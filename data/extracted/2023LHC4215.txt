JUDGMENT 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MUHAMMAD RAZA QURESHI, J. This is an Application under 
Section 12(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (the “CPC”) calling 
into question the legality, validity and propriety of the Judgment and 
Decree dated 15.12.2006 passed by this Court in Regular Second Appeal 
No.146 of 2006, which was filed against the Judgment and Decree dated 
18.03.2006 passed by learned Additional District Judge, Mianwali being 
Appellate Court and Judgment and Decree dated 14.06.2005 passed by 
learned Senior Civil Judge, Mianwali, being Trial Court. 
2. 
The instant Application has been filed on behalf of Federation of 
Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Works, Islamabad. 
The contention of the Applicant is that Suit for recovery of an amount of 
Rs.347,562.70 along with 20% compound interest and damages of 
Date of Hearing 
26.06.2023 
Applicant by: 
Mian Khalid Habib Elahi, Advocate. 
Respondent No.1 by: 
Respondents No.2 to 5 
Mr.Manzoor Hussain Dogar, Advocate. 
Mr. Waqar Saeed Khan, Assistant Advocate 
General.

C.M.No.72-C  of 2010 in RSA No.146 of 2006 
 
 
Rs.200,000/- was  not maintainable. According to learned counsel for the 
Applicant, the Suit was filed on 23.06.1999 by Muhammad Anwar Khan 
(“Respondent No.1”) against Government officials, namely, (i) 
Secretary Works Division Pak PWD Central Islamabad, (ii) Director 
General Pakistan PWD Central, Islamabad, (iii) Chief Engineer Central 
Zone (C.Z.) Pak PWD Islamabad and (iv) Executive Engineer Pak PWD 
Central Division Sargodha impleaded in the Suit as Defendants No.1 to 
4. According to learned counsel, admittedly though the afore-referred 
Government officials were impleaded but Federation of Pakistan through 
its Secretary was never impleaded in the Suit, whereas in terms of 
Section 79 of the CPC, the Suit could have only been filed by 
impleading Federation of Pakistan as a party. Reliance in this regard has 
been placed upon the judgments reported as Province of the Punjab 
through Member Board of Revenue, (Residual Properties), Lahore and 
others vs. Muhammad Hussain through legal heirs and others (PLD 
1993 SC 147), Government of Balochistan, CWPP&H Department and 
others vs. Nawabzada Mir Tariq Hussain Khan Magsi and others (2010 
SCMR 115) and Secretary, B. & R., Government of West Pakistan and 4 
others vs. Fazal Ali Khan (PLD 1971 Karachi 625).  
3. 
Seeking support from judgments referred supra, learned counsel 
for the Applicant submits that it was erroneous to sue officers of 
Federation, that too by mentioning their official title whereas the 
mandate of law commands that they could have only been sued through 
Pakistan. Further contends that the Appeals filed by official Respondents 
No.2 to 5 having no nexus with the relevant Department, was collusive 

-3- 
C.M.No.72-C  of 2010 in RSA No.146 of 2006 
 
 
and fraudulent as they had no legal competence or capacity to file any 
Appeal against the Judgment and Decree passed by the Trial Court, 
therefore, the subsequent Appeals before the District Court and this 
Court were incompetent and not maintainable. Reliance in this regard is 
placed upon the Judgment reported as Rehmat Ali vs. Additional Deputy 
Commissioner and others (1990 ALD 222(1), therefore, according to 
learned counsel, the proceedings throughout were sham, illegal, based 
upon misrepresentation and the Judgments and Decrees throughout 
suffered from want of jurisdiction and are liable to be recalled in 
exercise of powers under Section 12(2) of the CPC. 
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for Respondent No.1 submits that 
Suit was filed by Respondent No.1 on account of breach of terms of 
contract dated 24.06.1996 and Respondent No.1 sought recovery of 
amount along with compound interest and damages and institution of 
Suit against the official Respondents was maintainable as it was 
inconsequential whether Federation of Pakistan was impleaded in the 
Suit or not. Learned counsel contends that the Judgment and Decree was 
passed by Trial Court on 14.06.2005 and thereagainst the official 
Respondents filed an Appeal, which was dismissed through Judgment 
and Decree dated 18.03.2006 passed by the Appellate Court being barred 
by time. The said official Respondents filed Regular Second Appeal 
before this Court and this Court through Order dated 15.12.2006 also 
dismissed the  Appeal in limine by holding that Appellate Court rightly 
dismissed the Appeal being barred by time. One of the official 
Respondents, instead of assailing the Order passed by this Court before 

-4- 
C.M.No.72-C  of 2010 in RSA No.146 of 2006 
 
 
the Supreme Court of Pakistan rather preferred to file a Writ Petition in 
his personal name, which was dismissed in limine on 18.03.2009 being 
not maintainable. Thereafter, the said individual filed an Intra Court 
Appeal, which was also dismissed on 01.04.2009. The said Order was 
assailed before the Supreme Court of Pakistan through C.P.No.858-
L/2009, which was also dismissed through Order dated 10.11.2009, 
therefore, according to learned counsel, the Impugned Judgment and 
Decree has attained finality up till the Supreme Court of Pakistan and 
Application under Section 12(2) of  the CPC is not maintainable and if it 
was to be instituted, the same was expected to be filed before the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan. 
5. 
The arguments of learned counsel for the parties have been heard 
and record has been perused with their able assistance. The primary 
question emanating from the proceedings seeking determination by this 
Court is maintainability of the subject matter Application under Section 
12(2) of the CPC before this Court.  
6. 
At the outset, it is observed  that the contention of learned 
counsel for the Respondent No.1 that Judgment and Decree passed by 
Trial Court has attained finality up till the Supreme Court of Pakistan is 
inherently flawed as the proceedings out of Writ Petition went upto the 
Supreme Court were barred by law on two grounds; firstly, the Petitioner 
therein, namely, Mushtaq Hussain Bukhari had neither personal nor 
official capacity to initiate those proceedings against the Judgment and 
Decree passed by the Trial Court, that is why, his Writ Petition was 

-5- 
C.M.No.72-C  of 2010 in RSA No.146 of 2006 
 
 
dismissed in limine being not maintainable. Secondly, the Intra Court 
Appeal was dismissed thereagainst on the ground that appellate 
proceedings had already taken place and same was not maintainable and 
barred by law in terms of  Section 3(2) of the Law Reforms Ordinance, 
1972 and the Supreme Court through Order dated 10.11.2009 had upheld 
the Order passed in Intra Court Appeal. Therefore, it cannot be argued 
before this Court that Judgment and Decree had attained finality up till 
the Supreme Court of Pakistan. 
7. 
The Suit filed by the Respondent No.1 without impleading 
Federation of Pakistan appears to be inherently defective in terms of  
Section 79 of the CPC as well as judgments referred supra, therefore, the 
Applicant’s contention seems to be persuasive that any Appeal filed by 
official Respondents in their official or personal capacity against the 
Judgment and Decree passed by the Trial Court were hit by Rehmat 
Ali’s case supra.  
8. 
Now adverting to the main question as to the maintainability of 
an application under Section 12(2) of the CPC, certainly, where a person 
challenges the validity of a judgment, decree or order on the plea of 
fraud, misrepresentation or want of jurisdiction, he shall seek his remedy 
by making an application to the court which had passed the final 
judgment, decree or order and not by a separate Suit. In view of the 
aforesaid position of law, it is to be determined that in the instant case, 
which Court shall be considered to have passed the final judgment and 
decree. Under the law, a judgment and decree passed by the trial court is 

-6- 
C.M.No.72-C  of 2010 in RSA No.146 of 2006 
 
 
appealable before the higher forum or court of appeal. Once the court of 
appeal adjudicates the controversy on point of law, fact or both and 
affirms, amends, varies or reverses the judgment and decree passed by 
the trial court, the realizable or executable judgment and decree is the 
one passed by the appellate court. It is simple for the reason that the 
judgment and decree passed by the trial court stands absorbed into the 
judgment and decree passed by the appellate court and the moment the 
judgment, decree or order is engrossed by higher forum’s judgment, 
decree or order the one passed by the lower court or forum in hierarchy 
losses its identity as it is swallowed by the deliberation of law or fact 
appreciated by the higher forum and the judgment, decree or order stands 
merged into judgment, decree or order passed by the appellate forum. 
Reliance in this regard is placed upon the judgment reported as 
F.A.Khan vs. The Government of Pakistan (PLD 1964 SC 520), Maulvi 
Abdul Qayyum vs. Syed Ali Asghar Shah and 5 others (1992 SCMR 
241) and Khawaja Muhammad Yousaf vs. Federal Government through 
Secretary, Ministry of Kashmir Affairs and Northern  Areas (1999 
SCMR 1516). The concept of doctrine of merger has more elaborately 
and authoritatively been explained in the judgment reported as 
Nasarullah Khan and others vs. Mukhtar-ul-Hassan and others (PLD 
2013 SC 478) where Supreme Court held that ‘merger’ of a judgment, 
decree or order means “that it is integrated, implanted, inculcated, 
infixed and instilled into decree of the higher forum and becomes the 
decree/order of the later forum for all legal intents and implications.” 

-7- 
C.M.No.72-C  of 2010 in RSA No.146 of 2006 
 
 
 9. 
Therefore, in cases where a remedy of appeal/revision is provided 
against a judgment, order and decree, or a remedy of writ is availed, the 
appellate/revisional/constitutional 
forum 
records 
reasons 
on 
the 
consideration of the issues of law and/or fact and the judgment, decree or 
order of the subordinate court/forum will merge into the decision of the 
appellate court etc. irrespective of the fact that such judgment reverses, 
varies or affirms the decision of the subordinate court/forum and its 
decision will be operative and capable of enforcement on the principle of 
merger and the application under Section 12(2) of the CPC will be 
maintainable before the appellate/revisional/ constitutional forum, as the 
case may be. This will be the situation where an appeal/revision/ 
constitutional petition is accepted and judgment etc. is reversed, varied, 
modified or affirmed on merits. 
10. 
 The exception to this rule is where an appeal/revision/writ 
petition is not disposed of on merits, but on some grounds other than on 
merits, the exception to the rule of merger comes into field. The rule of 
merger becomes inapplicable where an appeal etc. has been dismissed on 
technical ground, such as dismissal for non-prosecution, lack of 
jurisdiction, lack of competence, barred by law or barred by time. In 
such a case where controversy falls within the noted exceptions, the 
forum for an application under Section 12(2) of the CPC is the one 
against whose decision the matter has come and been disposed of in the 
above manner by the higher forum.  

-8- 
C.M.No.72-C  of 2010 in RSA No.146 of 2006 
 
 
11. 
In the judgment reported as Sahabzadi Maharunisa and another 
vs. Mst. Ghulam Sugharn and another (PLD 2016 SC 358), the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan amongst others framed question No.(ii) in paragraph 8 
of the judgment as that “Where an appeal/revision/writ is not disposed 
of on merits but on some other grounds”, what will be the fate under 
principles of merger for determination of forum to file an application 
under Section 12(2) of the CPC and in paragraph 9 concluded as under: 
 (ii)        In the situation mentioned at serial No.(ii) above, there 
are certain exceptions to the rule of merger which (rule) 
shall not apply, where an appeal etc. has been dismissed:- 
(i) for non-prosecution; (ii) for lack of jurisdiction; (iii) 
for lack of competence/ maintainability; (iv) as barred by 
law; (v) as barred by time; (vi) withdrawal of the matter 
by the party; (vii) for lack of locus standi; (viii) decided on 
the basis of a compromise, if the very basis of the 
compromise by the party to the lis or even a stranger 
showing prejudice to his rights is not under challenge on 
the ground of fraud; (ix) is rendered infructuous or 
disposed of as having borne fruit; (x) abatement; (xi) 
where the writ is dismissed on the ground of availability of 
alternate remedy; (xii) where the writ is dismissed on the 
point of laches. It may be mentioned that such exceptions 
shall also be attracted to the decision(s) of the Supreme 
Court, where applicable. However where the case falls 
within the noted exceptions the forum for an application 
under Section 12(2) of the C.P.C. is the one against whose 
decision the matter has come and been disposed of in the 
above manner by the higher forum; 
                                                                      [emphasis supplied] 
 
12. 
Now applying the legal position in the facts and circumstances 
of the instant case, the first forum which passed defective Judgment and 
Decree was the Trial Court. The said Judgment and Decree was assailed 
before the lower Appellate Court through an incompetent Appeal, which 
dismissed the said Appeal on different ground i.e. being barred by time 
and when the said Order of lower Appellate Court  was assailed before 

-9- 
C.M.No.72-C  of 2010 in RSA No.146 of 2006 
 
 
this Court in a time barred Regular Second Appeal, the Judgment passed 
by the Appellate Court declaring the Appeal filed by the official 
Respondents being barred by time, the rule of merger became 
inapplicable as the Judgment and Decree passed by the Trial Court 
actually never merged into Order/Judgment passed by the lower 
Appellate Court as it neither adjudicated controversy on fact nor on law 
and dismissed the Appeal being barred by time and likewise, before this 
Court which upheld the Order passed by the lower Appellate Court. 
Therefore, the final and only Court which passed the Judgment  on 
merits in terms of Section 12(2) of the CPC is not this Court rather it is 
the Trial Court/Civil Court as the Judgment and Decree passed by it 
never merged into Judgment/Order passed by the lower Appellate Court 
or this Court.  
13. 
Therefore, it is held that the instant Application under section 
12(2) though maintainable but was not to be instituted before this Court, 
rather it should have been instituted before the Trial Court, which is the 
sole forum who determined merits of the case and was never reversed, 
modified or affirmed on merits by any subsequent forum and the case of 
the Applicant clearly falls under the exceptions contained in paragraph 
No.9 (ii) of Sahabzadi Maharunisa’s case supra. 
14. 
It is needless to mention that the Applicant in view of clear 
position of law under Section 79 of the CPC and judgments referred 
supra has an independent remedy under Section 47 of the CPC to 
question and challenge the executability of the subject matter Judgment 

-10- 
C.M.No.72-C  of 2010 in RSA No.146 of 2006 
 
 
and Decree passed by the Trial Court against Federation of Pakistan as 
the Suit filed by the Respondent No.1 was defective in its form and 
substance.  
15. 
Since this Court has held that instant Application under Section 
12(2) of the CPC is not maintainable before this Court, therefore, the 
same is returned to the Applicant/Federation of Pakistan under Order 
VII rule 10 of the CPC for the reasons and grounds discussed in the 
preceding paragraphs for its presentation before the Trial Court. If the 
Applicant files instant application along with an application seeking 
condonation of delay, the Court seized with the matter shall seek 
guidance from judgment reported as Abid Kamal vs. Muddassar Mustafa 
and others (2000 SCMR 900) and shall sympathetically consider request 
for condonation of delay in filing of the application, because the 
Applicant consumed some time in pursuing proceedings before this 
Court. 
16. 
Application is Returned.
