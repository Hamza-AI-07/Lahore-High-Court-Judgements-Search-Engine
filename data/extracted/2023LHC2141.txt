No.2. 
 
 
 
Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – Respondent No.2 lodged FIR 
No.613/2021 dated 19.12.2021 at Police Station City Shakargarh, District 
Narowal, against the Petitioner and two others, including Zahid Hussain and 
Irfan alias Panni, accusing them of the murder of Shahid Naseer. The police 
investigated the case and submitted a report under section 173 Cr.P.C. before 
the Magistrate Section-30, Shakargarh, on 12.10.2022. He submitted the case 
(which was flagged as “The State v. Fauji Waqar etc.”) to the Sessions 
Judge, Narowal. On 20.10.2022, the latter entrusted it to Mr Asif Bashir, 
Additional Sessions Judge, Shakargarh. On 20.10.2022, Mr Asif was on 
leave so the police produced the Petitioner in custody before the Duty Judge 
at Shakargarh. He summoned co-accused Zahid and Irfan to stand trial. By 
this petition under section 526 Cr.P.C., the Petitioner seeks the transfer of the 
aforesaid case from the court of Mr Arif Bashir to another court of 
competent jurisdiction at the District Headquarters Narowal. 
2.  
The Petitioner’s grievance is that the instructions issued by this 
Court have not been followed for determining the venue of trial in the above-
mentioned case. 
3.  
The Petitioner had not impleaded Zahid Hussain and Irfan alias 
Panni in this petition. This Court admitted them as Respondents No.3 and 4 
by order dated 16.2.2022. They were issued notices but have not shown up to 
oppose this petition. 
4.  
Heard. Record perused.

Sir, 
 
 
The Hon’ble Chief Justice and Judges have been pleased

Headquarters. The cases in which trial has not yet commenced shall 
stand transferred to the respective District & Sessions Judges for 
entrustment to the Additional District and Sessions Judges at the District 
Headquarters. However, all those cases in which a charge has been 
framed/trial has commenced shall be finalized in the courts in which they 
are presently pending.

TRIAL   OF   SESSIONS   CASES   AT   DISTRICT 
 
 
HEADQUARTERS 
Sir, 
  
 
In continuation of this Court’s Circular Letter No. 
2071/RHC, dated 29.11.1997, I am directed by the Hon’ble Chief Justice 
and Judges to say that bail applications in sessions cases shall be heard at 
the respective Sub-Divisions only during the stage of investigation, but 
once the challan, complete or incomplete, is submitted in Court then the 
bail applications shall be disposed of at the District Headquarters. 
2. 
 
It is also clarified that all the Hudood cases under 
Ordinance VII of 1979 shall be tried at the respective Tehsil 
headquarters, as before.

Thereafter, in supersession of Letter No.2071/RHC dated 
29.11.1997, this Court issued the following direction on 25.5.1999: 
 
LAHORE HIGH COURT, LAHORE 
No.7886/RHC/MIT 
25th May 1999 
From 
 
 
Abdus Salam Khawar, 
 
 
Member Inspection Team, 
 
 
Lahore High Court,

To 
 
 
All the District & Sessions Judges 
 
 
in the Punjab. 
Subject: 
TRIAL 
OF 
SESSIONS 
CASES 
AT 
SUB- 
 
 
DIVISIONAL HEADQUARTERS 
 
 
In supersession of the Letter No. 2071/RHC dated 
29.11.1997, I am directed by the Hon'ble Chief Justice and Judges to say 
that ordinarily the trial of sessions cases (except Hudood cases) shall be 
conducted at the district headquarters. However, accused will be given 
the option of the trial at the Sub-Division at the time of his appearance 
before the Magistrate for purpose of Section 190 Cr.P.C. Such an option 
shall be duly recorded by the learned Magistrate. In case there is more 
than one accused and all the accused do not agree to the trial at Sub-
Division, the District & Sessions Judge shall, at his discretion, decide the 
place of trial. 
2. 
 
As regards the bail petitions filed during the 
investigation the Circular letter No. 2012/RHC/MIT dated 11.12.1997 
shall be followed. Accordingly, the bail applications in the sessions cases 
shall be heard at the respective Sub-Divisions only during the stage of 
investigation, but once the accused has opted to have his trial at the 
Headquarters or Sub-Division, thereafter, bail application shall only be 
entertained by the Trial Court. Furthermore, it is clarified that all the 
Hudood cases under Ordinance 7 of 1979 shall continue to be tried at the 
respective Tehsil Headquarters as before. All concerned be informed 
accordingly. 
3. 
 
Kindly acknowledge receipt of this letter. 
 
 
 
 
   Your obedient servant, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Member Inspection Team) 
8.  
According to the above instructions, sessions cases (excluding 
Hadood cases) should normally be tried at the District Headquarters. 
Nonetheless, when the accused appears before the Magistrate for the purpose 
of section 190 Cr.P.C., he should give him the choice of a trial at the sub-
division. If there are multiple accused and they all do not consent to the trial 
at the sub-division, the Sessions Judge shall decide the place of trial at his 
discretion. 
9.  
In the present case, on 12.10.2022, the police produced the 
Petitioner before the Magistrate in custody while Zahid Hussain appeared on 
his own because he was on bail. The Magistrate observed that the case was 

Crl. Misc. No.76558/T/2022 
 
4
exclusively triable by the Court of Session and mechanically forwarded it to 
the Sessions Judge, Narowal, for “appropriate orders”. As per Letter No. 
7886/RHC/MIT dated 25.5.1999, reproduced above, he was obligated to ask 
the accused whether they preferred that their trial be held at the District 
Headquarters or the Sub-Division when they appeared before him. He was 
required to document the fact that he had provided such an option to the 
accused. Nothing on the record indicates that he gave the Petitioner and his 
co-accused that choice. 
10.  
The file was placed before the Sessions Judge, Narowal, on 
17.10.2022. However, it does not appear from the record that the Petitioner 
or his co-accused attended his court. He unilaterally entrusted the case to Mr 
Asif Bashir, Additional Sessions Judge, Shakargarh, who fixed 20.10.2022 
as the hearing date before him. On the said date, Mr Asif was on leave. The 
Duty Judge took up the case and issued a summons to Zahid and Irfan. The 
Petitioner was produced before him in custody. The Duty Judge also did not 
inquire whether he wanted the trial to be held at the District Headquarters or 
the Sub-Division. 
11.  
Letter No. 7886/RHC/MIT dated 25.5.1999 gives the accused a 
valuable right to choose the place of trial which cannot be denied to him. If 
the complainant party has any issue, it has a legal remedy under section 526 
Cr.P.C. 
12.  
Since Respondents No.3 and 4 have not contested this petition, 
the Petitioner’s request must be granted. Accordingly, the case titled  
“The State v. Fauji Waqar etc.” is withdrawn from Mr Asif Bashir and 
transferred to the Sessions Judge, Narowal. 
13.  
Respondent No.2 prays that the transferee court may be directed 
to decide the case as soon as possible. The Deputy Prosecutor General has no 
objection.  Therefore, the Sessions Judge, Narowal, is directed to proceed 
with the case expeditiously and ensure its conclusion within six months from 
the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order. 
14.  
Disposed of.
