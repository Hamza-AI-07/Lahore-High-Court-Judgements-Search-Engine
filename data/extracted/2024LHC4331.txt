Malik Masroor Haider Usman, AAG on Court’s 
call.    
 
Contemporaneously, cases regarding effect 
of omission of Rule 17-A of the Punjab Civil 
Servants (Appointment & Conditions of Service) 
Rules, 1974 (“the Rules, 1974”) are profusely 
coming for adjudication. This petition belongs to 
same category, notionally differing in the facts 
involved. 
Learned 
law 
officer 
is 
found 
conversant with the matter. 
2. 
Petitioner hereby questions legality of order 
dated 26.09.2024 (in short, the “impugned 
order”), whereby petitioner’s right to be 
considered for appointment under Rule 17-A of 
the Rules, 1974, claiming to have had arisen 
before omission of the rule, was declined on 
simple premise that Rule 17-A was no more part 
of the Rulebook. 
3. 
Scope of instant petition is purely a legal 
issue, which is to judicially review the position 
adopted by the Government of Punjab, and, for 
the purposes of this petition, the Chief Executive 
Officer District Education Authority while 

W.P. No.13444/2024

interpreting the omission of Rule 17-A, carried 
out vide Notification No.SOR-III(S&GAD)2-
60/2024 dated 24.07.2024, (in short, Notification 
dated 24.07.2024).  
  
It transpired that Government had issued 
various notifications, subsequently, to fortify 
their position regarding omission of Rule 17-A of 
the Rules, 1974, details whereof are found in the 
text of the impugned order of 26.09.2024 and 
paragraphs 3 to 6 of the orders are reproduced 
hereunder,  
3. 
“As per amended Notification issued by 
Govt. 
of 
the Punjab, Services 
& General 
Administration Department (Regulations Wing), 
Lahore vide Notification No SOR-III(S&GAD)2 
60/2024, dated 24.07.2024 (Copy enclosed as 
Annex-A), the operative part of the amendment is 
reproduced hereunder; 
"In the Punjab Civil Servants (Appointment 
and Conditions of Service) Rules, 1974, Rule 
17-A shall be omitted." 
4.  
Later on, Govt. of the Punjab, Services & 
General Administration Department (Regulations 
Wing), Lahore issued an advice/clarification with 
reference to Notification dated 24.07.2024 vide No. 
SOR-III(S&GAD)2-60/2024, 
dated 
15.08.2024 
(Copy enclosed as Annex-B) the operative part of 
the clarification is reproduced hereunder; 
"2. The Regulation Wing, S&GAD has 
examined the matter and it is observed that 
since 17-A Rule of the Punjab Civil Servants 
(Appointment and Conditions of Service) 
Rules, 1974 has been omitted after approval 
of the Provincial Cabinet Punjab, hence, no 
question arises for making appointment 
under 17-A of the rules ibid. 
5. 
Recently, Govt. of the Punjab, Services & 
General Administration Department Regulations 
Wing), Lahore has issued another clarification with 
reference to Notification dated 24.07 2024 vide No. 
SOR-III(S&GAD)2-60/2024, 
dated 
23.09.2024 
(Copy enclosed as Annex-C),the operative part of 
the clarification is reproduced hereunder; 
"c). It was a policy decision of the 
Government. 

W.P. No.13444/2024

d). No appointment under Rule 17-A can be 
made w.e.f 24.07.2024 (the date of approval 
of the Competent Authority) as the said rule 
is no more exist now." 
6. 
In view of above mentioned facts, reasons 
and circumstances, the representation of the 
petitioner for his appointment under 17-A Rule is 
hereby rejected being devoid of merit having no 
legal ground”. 
4. 
Fundamental question is that whether the 
policymakers 
had 
intended 
or 
provided 
retrospective effect to the omission of Rule17-A 
of the Rules, 1974?  
  
Upon bare textual reading no such intent, 
expressive 
or 
implied, 
is 
evident 
from 
Notification dated 24.07.2024, wherein use of the 
expression ‘shall’ manifests clarity of thought 
and actual intent of the policymaker(s). I had no 
difficulty to read and opine that effect of 
omission of Rule 17-A of the Rules, 1974 is 
prospective, and not retrospective. Impugned 
order is apparently contrary to the intent 
expressed through Notification dated 24.07.2024. 
In the context of the Notification dated 
24.07.2024, few striking questions / issues need 
discussion to bring home clarity thereto, which 
are,  
(i) 
Whether Rule17-A of the Rules, 
1974 
constitute 
a 
specie 
of 
concession by way of quota?  
(ii) 
Is Rule 17-A creates a vested right?  
(iii) 
What would be the triggering event 
for the purposes of invoking Rule17-
A of the Rules, 1974?  
Questions are responded in order of 
preference.  

W.P. No.13444/2024

5. 
Rule 17-A of the Rules, 1974 cannot be 
confused with the quota system, which is 
intended 
to 
provide 
opportunities 
to 
underrepresented and marginalized segment of 
the population or minorities, etc., and designed in 
a manner that proportionate representation was 
reserved. Conversely, Rule 17-A had the 
objective to ensure continuity of employment in 
the family, in wake of an unwarranted accident 
/mishap – intent being to provide compensation 
or financial security. It is more like a succession 
in terms of employment, but subject to the 
limitations and conditions. Rule 17-A of the 
Rules, 1974, loosely construed tantamount to a 
collateral service benefit, extended to the Civil 
Servant by offering employment to unemployed 
children or widow, which accrues only upon 
happening of an event specified – which is death 
of the civil servant or declaration of invalidation / 
incapacitation, which extends an unemployed 
heir a right to be considered for appointment, 
provided such interest is demonstrated by an 
overt act on the part of interested heir, including 
widow as the case may be. Benefit offered is 
simply by dint of the services performed by the 
civil servant, available to the family upon death 
or declaration of invalidation / incapacitation. It 
is pertinent to mention that benefit extended 
under Rule 17-A of the Rules, 1974 does not 
constitute part of the terms or conditions of 
service, but privilege, since no entitlement could 
be claimed under Rule 17-A of the Rules, 1974, 
unless conditions prescribed therein are fully met. 
An alive or healthy civil servant cannot claim 

W.P. No.13444/2024 
 
5
such appointment as a right for family, which 
privilege in fact accrues upon happening of 
specified event, whereby actually the services 
stood terminated, but continuity to service was 
extended by fiction in exercise of rule-making 
power, in favour of the family. Hence, Rule 17-A 
of the Rules, 1974 cannot be confused with the 
quota system. First issue addressed. 
6. 
Does it create a vested or an enforceable 
right? Rule 17-A does not create a vested right, 
since vested right is free from any and all 
contingencies but in fact Rule 17-A contained in-
built limitations and conditions, which have had 
to be met before someone could claim a right to 
be considered for appointment. There is a marked 
difference between a vested right to appointment 
and right to be considered for appointment. Rule 
17-A of the Rules, 1974 offers an opportunity / 
permission to knock at the door, to be opened 
once limitations stated and conditions prescribed 
are fully met. Yes, such privilege extending right 
to be 
considered for 
appointment, stood 
graduated to an entitlement, and is enforceable, if 
someone claims to have had fulfilled all the 
conditionalities, including but not limited to the 
condition of one’s eligibility. This court in the 
exercise of constitutional jurisdiction cannot 
order / direct appointment unless privilege 
available matured into an enforceable entitlement. 
Doctrine of ‘locus poenitentiae’ backed in terms 
of section 20 of the Punjab General Clauses Act 
1956 is attracted, in the context of the entitlement 
claimed under Rule 17-A of the Rules, 1974. 
Second issue is answered.   

W.P. No.13444/2024

7. 
Rule 17-A provides an in-built mechanism 
for its invocation. It is expedient to reproduce 
Rule 17-A of the Rules, 1974 for ease of 
understanding:  
“17-A. Notwithstanding anything contained 
in any rule to the contrary, whenever a civil 
servant dies while in service or is declared 
invalidated/incapacitated for further service, 
one of his unemployed children or his 
widow/wife may be employed by the 
Appointing Authority against a post to be 
filled under rules 16 and 17 for which he/she 
possesses the prescribed qualification and 
experience and such child or the widow/wife 
may be given 10 additional marks in the 
aggregate by the Public Service Commission 
or by the appropriate Selection Board or 
Committee 
provided 
he/she 
otherwise 
qualifies in the test/examination and/ or 
interview for posts in BS-6 and above. 
Provided 
further 
that 
one 
child 
or 
widow/wife or a Government servant who 
dies while in service or is declared 
invalidated/ incapacitated for further service 
shall be provided a job against posts in BS-1 
to 5 and the posts of Junior Clerks (BS-7) in 
the department in which the deceased 
Government servant was working without 
observance of formalities prescribed under 
the rules/procedure. Provided such child or 
the widow/ wife is otherwise eligible for the 
post”. 
  
In terms of Rule 17-A, ibid, specified 
triggering event is the occasion when civil 
servant dies during service or is declared 
invalidated / incapacitated. This requires no 
elaboration. If Civil servant had died or declared 
invalidated / incapacitated before the Notification 
dated 24.07.2024, and any of his unemployed 
children or widow had expressed willingness to 
invoke / seek benefit of Rule 17-A, omission of 
Rule 17-A would not prejudice the right to be 
considered for appointment, subject to fulfilling 
limitations 
and 
conditions 
provided. 
Hypothetically speaking, if a civil servant had 

W.P. No.13444/2024 
 
7
died on 23.07.2024, could right to be considered 
be 
denied 
without 
affording / 
extending 
reasonable time for demonstrating the intent of 
an heir to invoke Rule 17-A. Such denial would 
be unreasonable and otherwise not sustainable in 
the context of doctrine of ‘locus poenitentiae’. In 
brief, happening of a triggering event in terms of 
Rule 17-A of the Rules, 1974, if had happened 
before omission of Rule 17-A, ibid, took effect, 
would extend right to be considered. It is not 
possible to consider and discuss every instance or 
eventuality, which determination is left for the 
department to be carried out on case-to-case basis. 
Third issue also responded. 
8. 
In view of above narration, it is clear that 
through impugned order respondent(s) had 
attempted to give retrospective 
effect to 
Notification 
dated 
24.07.2024, 
which 
interpretation is preposterous, misdirected and 
manifest erred reading / interpretation of the 
Notification, 
not 
even 
intended 
by 
the 
policymaker / rule-making authority. Hence, 
impugned order is not sustainable in law. 
9. 
This petition is allowed and impugned order 
is set-aside. It is pertinent to observe that this 
order shall not be construed as an order directing 
appointment of the petitioner, but simplicitor an 
illustrative and interpretative reading of the 
Notification dated 24.07.2024 in the context of 
its prospective effect / application. Petitioner’s 
right to be considered for appointment in terms 
of Rule 17-A would be examined, considered and 
decided on the basis of facts and circumstances 

W.P. No.13444/2024

existing / involved. Assistance offered by the law 
officer and promptness shown in deciding this 
case is highly appreciated.
