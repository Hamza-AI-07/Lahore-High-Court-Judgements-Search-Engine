Mr. Irfan Ali Sheikh, Advocate for the appellant.

respondents. 
 
This 
Regular 
First 
Appeal 
(Appeal) 
challenges legality of judgment and decree dated 
29.04.2014, whereby suit for recovery of overdue 
finance, instituted by Financial Institution 
(appellant), was decreed for Rs.560,000/- with 
costs of suit, but only to the extent of respondents 
No.9 to 13 and suit against respondents 1 to 8 
was dismissed.  
2. 
Suit 
for 
recovery 
was 
instituted 
on 
01.10.1998, wherein leave to defend was allowed 
on 07.06.1999 and same was decreed on 
29.04.2014. 
Controversy-in-issue   
3. 
Cost of Funds was declined to the appellant 
on the premises that suit was instituted under 
Banking 
Companies 
(Recovery 
of 
Loans, 
Advances, Credits and Finances) Act, 1997 (Act 

RFA No.1538/2015 
  
 
-:2:- 
 
of 1997) but at the time of decree the applicable 
law is Financial Institutions (Recovery of 
Finances) Ordinance, 2001 (Ordinance of 2001) 
therefore no cost of funds could be awarded by 
extending retrospective effect to section 3 of the 
Ordinance, 2001. 
4. 
Learned counsel for appellant submits that 
Court erred in law while declining cost of funds, 
otherwise permissible in lieu of Mark-up-based 
finances. Adds that decision in the case of 
National Bank of Pakistan through Manager vs. Messrs 
Footcare (Pvt.) Limited through Chief Executive and 
others (2005 CLD 1114) is a bad law. 
5. 
Learned counsel for respondents wholly 
relied on the dicta laid down in the cases of 
National Bank of Pakistan through Manager vs. Messrs 
Footcare (Pvt.) Limited through Chief Executive and 
others (2005 CLD 1114) and Messrs A.M. Rice 
Corporation through Sole Proprietor and another vs. 
Bank of Punjab through Manager as Attorney (2005 
CLD 1569).  
6. 
Heard - No other point, except dispute qua 
question of refusal to grant cost of funds was 
pressed / argued.

7. 
The controversy in issue was contextualized 
in preceding paragraphs. Cost of funds was 
declined by Banking Court while relying on the 
ratio settled in referred cases, decisions by the 
coordinate Bench of this Court, wherein 
declaration against retrospective application of 
the provisions of the Ordinance of 2001, 
particularly section 3 thereof was made. We have 
examined said decisions. With all respect, it is 
noted that while deciding the referred cases, 
simplicitor the effect of section 3 of Ordinance of 
2001 was considered without appreciating the 
scope, mandate and effect of section 29 of the 
Ordinance of 2001. Decisions were made without 
adverting to nature of the facility, either interest-
based or mark-up-based. It is evident that Act of 
1997 
defines 
and 
maintains 
conspicuous 
distinction between two kinds of financing. We 
are dealing with markup-based financing. For 
dilating upon controversy, it is expedient to 
reproduce sections 3 and 29 of the Ordinance of 
2001, 
 
“Section 3 - Duty of a Customer: 
(1) It shall be the duty of a customer to fulfill his 
obligations to the financial institution. 
(2)   Where the customer defaults in the discharge 
of his obligation, he shall be liable to pay, for the 
period from the date of his default till realization of 

RFA No.1538/2015 
  
 
-:4:- 
 
the cost of funds of the financial institution as 
certified by the State Bank of Pakistan from time to 
time, apart from such other civil and criminal 
liabilities that he may incur under the contract or 
rules or any other law for the time being in force. 
(3)   For purposes of this section a judgment against 
a customer under this Ordinance shall mean that he 
is in default of his duty under sub-section (1) and 
the ensuing decree shall provide for the payment of 
cost of funds as determined under sub-section (2). 
“Section 29 – Repeals:  
(I)The Banking Companies (Recovery of Loans, 
Advances, Credits and Finances) Act, 1997 (Act XV 
of 1997) is hereby repealed. 
(2) Notwithstanding the repeal of the (Recovery of 
Loans, Advances, Credits and Finances) Act, 1997 
(Act XV of 1997) and the provisions of this 
Ordinance, decrees in cases relating to interest-
bearing loans which have not been converted into 
finance shall be passed in accordance with the 
provisions of section 15 of the said Act.” 
[Emphasis supplied] 
8. 
In terms of sub-section (2) of section 29 of 
Ordinance, 2001, no decree could lawfully be 
passed under the Act, 1997 with respect to mark-
up-based finance. And only interest-bearing-
loans could be decreed under section 15 of Act of 
1997. Hence, if at all decree had to be passed 
regarding 
mark-up-based 
finance, 
in 
all 
possibility, it had to be under Ordinance of 2001. 
Section 29 is the bridge for dealing with 
adjudication of claims of mark-up-based finances 
under the provisions of Ordinance of 2001, 
notwithstanding 
institution 
of 
suits 
under 
provisions of Act of 1997.  

RFA No.1538/2015 
  
 
-:5:- 
 
9. 
In view of the above, it is evident that 
Banking Court committed error of law while 
declining cost of funds on erroneous assumption 
that section 3 of the Ordinance of 2001 has no 
application.  
  
Now we discuss the effect of ratio settled in 
the judgments referred in the context of 
expressive legislative intent expressed through 
section 29 of Ordinance of 2001. We have 
threadbare examined referred judgments, wherein 
neither existence of section 29 of the Ordinance 
of 2001 was acknowledged nor effect thereof was 
raised, argued, discussed and adjudicated. This 
attracts the doctrine of “Sub-Silento”. See the 
case of Lancaster Motor Company (London) Ltd. 
v. Bremith Ltd. ([1941] 1KB 675). With all 
respect, conspicuous absence of reference to or 
discussion qua section 29 of Ordinance of 2001 
renders the judgments per incuriam – wherein 
section 29 of the Ordinance of 2001 escaped 
attention of learned coordinate Bench. Since, 
judgments referred are per incuriam therefore 
there was no necessity of seeking constitution of 
larger Bench – since we are not required to make 
a choice between two different set of judgments 

RFA No.1538/2015 
  
 
-:6:- 
 
but dealing with the per incuriam judgments. 
Ratio settled in the case of “MULTILINE 
ASSOCIATES v. ARDESHIR COVASJEE and 
2 others” (PLD 1995 Supreme Court 423), is not 
attracted, wherein it was settled that reference to 
larger Bench is required if Bench of coequal 
judges do not agree with earlier judgment by the 
Bench of coequal judges. Conversely, guidance 
is solicited from the ratio settled in the case of 
Gulshan Ara vs. The State (2010 SCMR 1162), 
relevant 
portion 
wherefrom 
is 
reproduced 
hereunder as, 
“4. It appears that a contrary view was taken by 
two other Benches of equal number of Judges in the 
cases of Muhammad Hashim and Amanat Ali 
(supra). In such a situation, apparently the rule laid 
down by the case of Multiline Associates v. Ardeshir 
Covasjee PLD 1995 SC 423 was required to have 
been followed which is that if a Bench of equal 
Judges does not agree with the earlier Bench of 
equal Judges, then the matter should be referred to 
a larger Bench. It appears that earlier decisions of 
this Court in the cases of Nadir Khan and Ali 
Muhammad (supra) were not brought to the notice 
of the Benches in the cases of Muhammad Hashim 
and Amanat Ali (supra), therefore, the principle 
laid down in the said cases was never discussed. In 
such a situation this Court in the case of Province 
of the Punjab v. S. Muhammad Zafar Bukhari PLD 
1997 SC 351 observed as under:-- 
“Halsbury’s Laws of England, Fourth 
Edition, volume 26 in paras 577-578, has 
commented on the “judgment per incuriam” 
as under: 
“A decision is given per incuriam when the 
Court has acted in ignorance of previous 
decision of its own or of a Court of 
coordinate jurisdiction which covered the 
case before it in which case it must decide 
which case to follow or when it has acted in 
ignorance of House of a Lords’ decision, in 

RFA No.1538/2015 
  
 
-:7:- 
 
which case it must follow that decision or 
when the decision is given in ignorance of 
the terms of statute or rule has statutory 
force.” 
[Emphasis supplied] 
10. Reference is made to decision in the case of 
leaned Supreme Court of India in the case of 
STATE OF U.P AND ANR. v. M/S SYNTHETICS 
AND CHEMICALS LTD. AND ANR. [1991 SCC 
(4)139], 
relevant 
paragraph 
is 
reproduced 
hereunder,  
‘Incuria’ literally means ‘carelessness’. In 
practice per incuriam appears to mean per 
ignoratium. English Courts have developed 
this principle in relaxation of the rule of 
stare decisis. The ‘quotable in law’ is 
avoided and ignored if it is rendered, ‘in 
ignoratium of a statute or other binding 
authority. (1944 1KB 718 ‘Young v. Bristol 
Aeroplane Ltd………. 
[Emphasis supplied] 
11. We, hold that judgment impugned to the 
extent of denying of cost of funds is legally 
defective and result of misconstruction of law. 
We, affirm the determination of principal liability 
of Rs.560,000/- and order of dismissal of suit 
against the respondents No.1 to 8, to which 
extent no illegality is pointed or found. 
12. In view of aforesaid, this appeal is partly 
allowed and decree to the extent of denial of 
claim of cost of funds is set-aside against 

RFA No.1538/2015

respondents No.9 to 13 only. Banking Court will 
determine cost of funds in accordance with the 
mandate of section 3 of the Ordinance of 2001, 
after hearing the parties, preferably within the 
period of ninety days of receipt of copy of this 
judgment.
