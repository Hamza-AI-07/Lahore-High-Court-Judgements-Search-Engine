Rasaal Hasan Syed, J. This civil 
revision calls in question judgment and decree 
dated 24.11.2020 as well as 09.6.2021 of the 
courts below. 
2. 
Brief background of the matter is that 
land measuring 21 kanals in Chak No. 47/NB 
was initially leased out to Kalu son of 
Sherwali in year 1960-61 for setting up brick 
kiln which later was leased out through open 
auction 
in 
favour 
of 
respondent 
for 
establishing a brick kiln for a period of five 
years. On the request of respondent in the year 
1990, the sale of said land was approved in his 
favour. After process the respondent was 
communicated vide letter No. 7245-89/2797/ 
CS/VI dated 08.4.1990 the sanction of sale @ 
Rs. 1,50,000/- per kanal along with 10% 
surcharge which amount was required to be 
paid within six months. The District Collector, 

        C.R. No.55609 of 2021  
 
 
Page-2 
 
 
Sargodha  solicited advice from the Board of 
Revenue regarding issuance of Conveyance 
Deed in favour of respondent in respect of suit 
property which was allowed  vide order dated 
10.3.2016 (Ex. P2) subject to payment of Rs. 
29,05,454.51 alongwith compound interest. 
The respondent deposited the requisite amount  
as calculated by District Collector and 
thereafter a Conveyance Deed was prepared 
and issued in his favour on 16.6.2016 on 
deposit of dues. It was three months thereafter 
that the newly incumbent of District Collector, 
Sargodha made a Reference to the Board of 
Revenue Punjab vide letter No.368/CA/UCC 
dated 03.9.2016 seeking Review of the order 
dated 
10.3.2016 
and 
cancellation 
of 
Conveyance Deed under section 30(2) of the 
Colonization of Government Land (Punjab) 
Act, 1912 (the “Act”) whereupon Member 
(Colonies), Board of Revenue, Punjab issued 
notice to respondent and thereafter allowed 
the Review resulting in cancellation of 
Conveyance Deed in favour of respondent 
with an order to confiscate the amount 
deposited by him. This was vide order dated 
13.12.2017 of Member (Colonies), Board of 
Revenue, Punjab which order  was challenged 
by the respondent in civil suit, taking stance 
that the Board of Revenue had no jurisdiction 
to cancel the allotment under section 30(2) of 
the Act and that there was no fraud in the 
obtainment of sale nor it was so claimed and 
that on the issuance of Conveyance Deed the 
relationship of tenancy ceased  to exist and in 

        C.R. No.55609 of 2021  
 
 
Page-3 
 
 
fact absolute title vested in the respondent and 
that the remedy of respondent was to file a 
suit for seeking cancellation of the document 
which could not be unilaterally cancelled. The 
suit was resisted by the petitioners by filing 
written reply. Issues were framed, evidence of 
respondent was  recorded. The petitioners in 
the 
course 
of 
proceedings 
thereafter 
disappeared and were proceeded against ex 
parte and ultimately the suit of respondent was 
partly decreed to the extent of order of the 
Member (Colonies), Board of Revenue, 
Punjab regarding confiscation of the amount 
deposited which was declared to be untenable 
while 
the 
relief 
for 
cancellation 
of 
Conveyance Deed was declined. Appeal was 
filed by the respondent challenging the 
judgment and decree dated 24.11.2020  of the 
trial court. After considering the points raised 
in appeal as also the findings of the trial court, 
the appeal was accepted by the learned Addl. 
District Judge vide impugned judgment dated 
09.6.2021; in result, the judgment of the trial 
court was modified and the order of Member 
(Colonies), Board of Revenue, Punjab in 
respect of cancellation of Conveyance Deed 
was also annulled while the order of trial court 
to the extent of annulment of the confiscation 
of the amount deposited was not interfered 
with. In the instant revision petition, the 
petitioners 
have 
now 
challenged 
the 
judgments of the appellate court and also of 
the trial court.

4. 
From the facts as are evident in the 
documents appended with the petition, it is 
discernible that the suit property was initially 
leased out to Kalu son of Sherwali for the 
purpose of establishing a brick kiln was later 
leased out to the respondent through open 
auction for five years. At the request of 
respondent in the year 1990 the sale of land 
through private treaty was approved in favour 
of respondent as communicated vide letter 
dated 08.4.1990. The sale was sanctioned at 
the rate of Rs. 1,50,000/- per kanal along with 
10% surcharge which amount was to be 
deposited within six months. Later the 
respondent was allowed by the Board of 
Revenue to deposit this amount through 14 
half yearly installments. The respondent 
applied for the grant of proprietary rights of 
the property in the year 1990 which was 
allowed by Member (Colonies), Board of 
Revenue, Punjab as confirmed vide Ex.P1 
dated 19.8.1990 in terms thereof. On payment 
of the requisite amount, a request for issuance 
of Conveyance Deed was made on which a 
Reference was sent by District Collector 
Sargodha seeking advice for issuance of 
Conveyance Deed in favour of respondent 
which was heard and decided by Member 
(Colonies), Board of Revenue, Punjab who 
after hearing both sides passed order dated 
10.3.2016 operative part whereof is as 
follows: 
 
 

        C.R. No.55609 of 2021  
 
 
Page-5 
 
 
“4. 
In view of the above, it is observed that 
respondent paid total sale price of the land i.e. 
Rs. 40,55,343/- in 2004 which has been verified 
by the District Accounts Officer, Sargodha vide 
letter dated 23.12.2014. Now the issue under 
discussion relates to interest / penal interest for 
late payments that was deposited into the 
government treasury in 2004 instead of 1998. 
The District Collector, Sargodha  vide letter 
dated 17.3.2015  has calculated the said amount  
as Rs. 29,05,454.51 (normal interest Rs. 
1,27,116.66 
and 
penal 
interest 
Rs. 
16,34,292.85). The District Collector will also 
calculate and recover the compound interest  
from the respondent for the relevant period. 
The matter is referred to the District Collector, 
Sargodha with the direction to ensure that in 
future the land will not be used other than the 
purpose for which it was originally sold to the 
respondent. If the respondent deposits the 
above said amount i.e. Rs. 29,05,454.51  plus 
compound interest , to be calculated  by the 
District Officer for the relevant period, within 
(30) thirty days after issuance of the certified 
copy of this order then the Collector may 
proceed further in the matter in accordance 
with law/policy. Disposed of accordingly.” 
In pursuance to the permission granted the 
Conveyance Deed was executed in favour of 
respondent on 16.6.2016. Six months later, on 
03.9.2016 the later incumbent District Collector, 
Sargodha sent a Reference to the Board of 
Revenue for Review and invoking powers under 
section 30(2) of the Act; the case was examined 
by the Board of Revenue vide letter dated 
24.11.2016, notice under section 30(2) of the Act 
was issued against the respondent to explain as 
to why the Conveyance Deed should not be 
cancelled and the amount deposited be not 
confiscated. Vide order dated 13.12.2017 the 
Member (Colonies), Board of Revenue, Punjab 
directed 
that 
the 
Conveyance 
Deed 
and 
subsequent mutations attested in favour of the 
respondent be cancelled, the amount deposited 

        C.R. No.55609 of 2021  
 
 
Page-6 
 
 
be also confiscated and a direction was issued to 
the District Collector to impose penalty/tawaan, 
recover the same and ensure that the entry to this 
affect be incorporated in the Revenue Record. 
This order was challenged by the respondent in a 
civil suit wherein the cancellation of Conveyance 
Deed in his favour and confiscation of amount 
credited by him in the Treasury was ordered to 
be confiscated and tawaan was imposed. Main 
stance in the plaint was that the Board of 
Revenue  did not have jurisdiction to cancel the 
Conveyance Deed as the parties were no longer 
governed of terms of tenancy rather the 
respondent was holding the property as absolute 
owner; Review was solicited after the expiry of 
limitation 
period 
which 
aspect 
was 
not 
considered; there was no violation on the part of 
respondent as regard the terms and conditions of 
Conveyance Deed and that in any case the 
petitioners could not cancel the Conveyance 
Deed as there was no fraud in the execution of 
Conveyance Deed which was executed after due 
process and taking  into consideration of all the 
facts and that the remedy of petitioners was to 
file a civil suit. 
5. 
It is manifest from the impugned 
judgments that in so far as the order of the 
Member (Colonies), Board of Revenue, Punjab 
to the extent of confiscation of the deposited 
amount and imposition of tawaan, the same was 
held to be illegal by the learned Civil Judge who 
decreed the suit to that extent while in appeal the 
order of cancellation of Conveyance Deed was 
also held to be illegal and without jurisdiction. 

        C.R. No.55609 of 2021  
 
 
Page-7 
 
 
Perusal of the order passed by the Member 
(Colonies), Board of Revenue, Punjab  reveals 
that he acted purportedly under section 30(2) of 
the Act and directed cancellation of Conveyance 
Deed and also confiscation of the amount 
deposited, on the assumption as if the respondent 
had breached the terms and conditions of the 
lease by not obtaining NOC for establishing a 
brick kiln and that the brick kiln at site was in 
operation and that the condition of timely 
payment of installment were not fulfilled and 
that the revenue staff did not consider the ground 
reality. On these assumptions he opted to allow 
Review of the earlier order of his predecessor 
Member (Colonies), Board of Revenue, Punjab 
dated 10.3.2016.  
6. 
The foundational question in this case was 
as to whether the Member (Colonies), Board of 
Revenue, Punjab  could Review the order dated 
10.3.2016 
by 
which 
the 
execution 
of 
Conveyance Deed was approved and whether the 
Reference for review was within time and 
whether the pre-conditions of section 30(2) of 
the above Act existed in this case and also as to 
whether after the execution of conveyance deed, 
the Member (Colonies), Board of Revenue, 
Punjab had any jurisdiction to cancel the 
conveyance deed in the absence of pre-requisites 
of section 30(2) of the Act.  
7. 
Perusal of the file shows that in the instant 
case the approval of sale in favour of the 
respondent was communicated to the respondent 
vide letter dated 08.4.1990; sale was sanctioned 
at the rate of Rs. 1,50,000/- per kanal 

        C.R. No.55609 of 2021  
 
 
Page-8 
 
 
alongwith10% surcharge which amount was to 
be deposited within six months; later the Board 
of Revenue allowed the deposit of the amount 
through 14 half yearly installments;  respondent 
deposited the amount; and applied for the grant 
of proprietary rights through Conveyance Deed; 
which was allowed by Member (Colonies), 
Board of Revenue, Punjab vide Ex.P1 dated 
19.8.1990. On payment of requisite amount 
request for issuance of Conveyance Deed was 
made on which the Reference was sent by 
District Collector Sargodha seeking advice for 
issuance of Conveyance Deed in favour of the 
respondent. This was heard by 
Member 
(Colonies), Board of Revenue, Punjab and 
ultimately vide order dated 10.3.2016 in 
affirmative was passed. It was noticed  in the 
order that the respondent had deposited the sale 
price i.e. Rs. 40,55,343/- which was verified by 
District Accounts Officer, Sargodha vide letter 
dated 23.12.2014  and that issue relate to the 
interest/ penal interest for late payment  that was 
deposited in the Government Treasury in 2004 
instead of 1998 and that the District Collector, 
Sargodha had calculated the amount as Rs. 
29,05,454.51 (normal interest Rs. 1,27,111/- and 
penal interest Rs. 16,34,292.85). The Collector 
was directed to calculate and recover the 
compound interest from the respondent for the 
relevant period. It was also observed that in 
future it be ensured that the land did not get used 
for any purpose other than for which it was 
originally sold by to the respondent and if the 
respondent 
deposited 
the 
amount 
of 

        C.R. No.55609 of 2021  
 
 
Page-9 
 
 
Rs.29,05,454.51 plus compound interest to be 
calculated by District Collector/Officer for the 
relevant period in 30 days after issuance of copy 
of the order the matter may proceed further in 
accordance with law/policy. In pursuance thereof 
the Conveyance Deed was executed in favour of 
respondent. Six months later on 03.9.2016 there 
was a change at the office of District Collector 
and the new incumbent sent a Reference to 
Board of Revenue for Review and the case was 
fixed in the court on judicial side when the 
impugned order was passed vide order dated 
13.12.2017. It is manifest from the facts that the 
order under challenge was passed on 10.3.2016 
while the Review was sought on 03.9.2016. It 
was after six months from the date of order that 
the jurisdiction to Review was invoked under 
section 8(2) of the Board of Revenue Act, 1957 
and application for Review of order could only 
be made within 90 days of the order. In this case 
the Review was solicited after six months 
approximately. Reference was time-barred which 
could not be entertained on this score which 
aspect was ignored although it was the primary 
duty of the Member (Colonies), Board of 
Revenue, Punjab to attend to the question of 
limitation first; even if it was not raised. The 
order dated 13.12.2017 passed by the Member 
(Colonies), Board of Revenue, Punjab on a time-
barred reference is without jurisdiction and is 
liable to be annulled. 
8. 
As regards the provision of section 24(b) 
of the Act it has remained subject matter of 
consideration in number of cases decided by the 

        C.R. No.55609 of 2021  
 
 
Page-10 
 
 
superior courts and the consistent view is that 
once the Collector had confirmed the proprietary 
rights in favour of the original allottee through a 
registered sale deed the Provincial Government 
had no right to claim ownership and that if any 
fraud is detected it could only be challenged the 
same through a civil suit. Reference in this 
regard can be made to the case of Province Of 
Punjab and others v. Mst. Nabeela Taj and others 
(2013 YLR 2286). In Province Of the Punjab 
through District Officer, Toba Tek Singh and 
others v.  Nazir Ahmad and 9 others (2008 
SCMR 749) it was observed to the effect that the 
allottee after fulfilling the requisite formalities 
i.e. the payment of price etc., and execution and 
registration of sale deed in his favour,  the power 
with regard to the cancellation under sections 16 
and 30(2) of the Act can be exercised only in the 
case of tenancy and not in the case of permanent 
allotment and more so  with the pre-requisite of 
condition of fraud and misrepresentation and the 
impugned order was held as without jurisdiction 
by further observing that if the petitioners felt 
aggrieved of the allotment order the remedy for 
them was to file a civil suit.  Reference can also 
be made to the case of Muhammad Asghar v. 
Member Board of Revenue and others (2009 
MLD 1023) where it was observed to the effect 
that after payment of full price the allottee 
became sole owner and the statement of 
condition ceased to exist and allottee was no 
longer tenant. In the instant case, admittedly the 
payment of full price plus interest and penal 
interest had been confirmed and that the 

        C.R. No.55609 of 2021  
 
 
Page-11 
 
 
conveyance deed was ordered to be executed in 
favour of the respondent on receiving full 
consideration. It was thus a case in which 
respondent had full proprietary rights in the 
property and was no longer a tenant. The term as 
original tenancy ceases to operate. 
9. 
As to the grounds on which interference 
was made by the Member (Colonies), Board of 
Revenue, Punjab it is observed that none of these 
could be considered to be concealment of fact on 
the part of respondent nor the same could 
constitute fraud or misrepresentation. It is 
discernible from the order dated 10.3.2016 that 
the department fully knew that the property was 
leased out initially in 1967 and in 1990 the 
department agreed to sell the property in favour 
of the respondent, it was also in the knowledge 
of the Member (Colonies), Board of Revenue, 
Punjab  and the other officers of the department 
that the price was required to be paid initially 
within six months by the Board of Revenue itself 
considering the facts and circumstances allowed 
to pay the same in 14 half yearly installments. 
The respondent did pay 12 installments and issue 
remained only of two installments on which the 
question was as to what course of action should 
be adopted in respect of the late payment of 
remaining two installments and also the 
execution of Conveyance Deed. The Member 
(Colonies), Board of Revenue, Punjab passed a 
judicial order on 10.3.2016, took note of all the 
facts and considered that the respondent paid the 
sale amount in 2004 instead of 1998 and 
therefore, interest along with penal interest was 

        C.R. No.55609 of 2021  
 
 
Page-12 
 
 
imposed. The amount of penal interest was 
calculated by which was ordered to be paid with 
a direction to determine the penal interest for the 
remaining period as should be recovered for 
transfer of property.  The other conditions were 
that land should not be used for any purpose 
other than brick kiln. Admittedly the brick kiln 
was not functional at that time but despite that no 
action was taken on this count rather the view 
taken was that the department shall ensure that 
the property should be used only for brick kiln. It 
was not the case that the respondent concealed 
any information from the department rather 
office of Colonization Department was fully 
conscious of the ground reality as to late 
payment and also qua the brick kiln and after 
considering 
all 
these 
facts 
the 
department/Member 
(Colonies), 
Board 
of 
Revenue, Punjab allowed the process to be 
completed by execution of Conveyance Deed. 
The respondent did deposit the amount of sale 
price as determined, the interest and penal 
interest; whereupon the Conveyance Deed was 
executed with the condition that it should not be 
used for any other purpose except for the 
purpose of brick kiln. It was not the objection 
that this condition was not violated by using the 
property for different purposes rather the 
allegation was that the brick kiln was not 
functioning. This being so there was no question 
of fraud or misrepresentation or concealment of 
facts on the part of respondent and therefore, the 
pre-requisites of section 30(2) of the Act were 
not 
attracted. 
The 
department 
in 
these 

        C.R. No.55609 of 2021  
 
 
Page-13 
 
 
circumstances, if intended, could challenge the 
Conveyance Deed, by filing a civil suit instead of 
being a judge of their own cause. The order 
passed by the Member (Colonies), Board of 
Revenue, Punjab was illegal, without jurisdiction 
and liable to be held as such as has been declared 
in the impugned judgment of learned Addl. 
District Judge and the appeal was rightly allowed 
to this extent while the other part of relief 
regarding confiscation of amount deposited by 
respondent was declared to be illegal by the 
learned Civil Judge which order was not 
challenged either in appeal or by cross-
objections by the petitioners nor does it appear to 
have been seriously pressed at the time of 
hearing of this revision petition as the same 
attained finality. No misreading or non-reading 
of evidence could be pointed out during the 
course of hearing of the petition nor any such 
misreading or non-reading was observed. 
10. 
For the reasons stated above this revision 
petition is without any merit which is, 
accordingly, dismissed.
