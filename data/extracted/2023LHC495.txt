JUDGMENT. 
 
  
 
Mirza Viqas Rauf, J. This petition under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 arises out of an order 
dated 18th October, 2021, whereby the Additional Rent Controller, Chaklala 
Cantonment Board, Rawalpindi proceeded to pass the tentative rent order in a 
pending ejectment petition. 
2.  
Facts in brevity necessary for adjudication of instant petition are 
that respondent No.1 (hereinafter referred to as “respondent”) claiming 
himself to be the owner/landlord of property bearing Khewat No.174/170 
situated near filtration plant (front side) Ch. Niaz Ali Road Tulsa Road 
Lalazar, Rawalpindi  moved a petition under section 17 of the Cantonments 
Rent Restriction Act, 1963 (hereinafter referred to as “Act, 1963”)  seeking 
eviction of the petitioner on multiple grounds. While resisting the ejectment 
proceedings, the petitioner submitted his reply wherein he categorically denied 
the relationship of landlord and tenant. During the proceedings, the Additional 
Rent Controller proceeded to pass the tentative rent order in terms of section 
17 (8) of the “Act, 1963” on 18th October, 2021 directing the petitioner to 
deposit the rent @ Rs.20,000/- per month w.e.f October, 2020 to October, 
2021 amounting to Rs.2,60,000/- before 30th November, 2021 and also to 
Date of hearing: 
19.01.2023 
Petitioner by: 
Khawaja Hassan Riaz, Advocate. 
Respondent No.1

Syed Abbas Hussain Shah, Advocate.

deposit regular future rent before 5th of each month which is now impugned 
herein. 
3.  
Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that there exists no 
relationship of landlord and tenant between the petitioner and “respondent”. 
He added that when once the relationship was denied, it was incumbent upon 
the Additional Rent Controller to frame an issue to that effect. Learned 
counsel emphasized that in case of denial of relationship, the Additional Rent 
Controller could not pass the tentative rent order and the impugned order is 
illegal and unlawful. 
4.  
Conversely, learned counsel representing the “respondent” 
submitted that the impugned order is interlocutory order and as such writ 
petition is not maintainable. He added that tentative rent order was rightly 
passed by the learned Additional Rent Controller. 
5.  
Heard. Record perused. 
6.  
The precise and foremost question before this Court is as to whether 
in case of denial of relationship of landlord and tenant, the Additional Rent 
Controller was vested with the power to pass tentative rent order under section 
17 (8) of the “Act, 1963”. There is no denial to the fact that the petitioner, 
while submitting his reply, denied the relationship of landlord and tenant. The 
term “landlord” is defined in section 2(g) of the “Act, 1963”, which reads as 
under: - 
2 (g) “Landlord” means any person for the time being entitled to 
receive rent in respect of any building whether on his own account or on 
behalf or for the benefit of any other persons, or as a trustee, guardian or 
receiver and includes a tenant who, being authorised under the terms of his 
lease so to do, sublets the building and every other person for the time being 
deriving title from the landlord; 
Section 2 (j) provides the definition of “tenant” in the following manner: - 
2 (j) “tenant” means any person who undertakes or is bound to pay 
rent as consideration for the possession or occupation of a building by him 
or by any other person on his behalf, and includes:   
(i) 
any person who continues to be in possession or occupation 
of the building after the termination of his tenancy; and  

3 
 
 
 
W.PNo.3843 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
(ii) 
in the event of the death of the tenant, his heirs and 
successors and after the termination of the tenancy, his heirs 
and successors who continue to be in possession or 
occupation of the building. 
7.  
A landlord can seek eviction of tenant by moving a petition under 
section 17 of the “Act 1963” on the grounds mentioned therein. Subsection 8 
of section 17 empowers the Rent Controller to direct the tenant to deposit in 
his office before a specified date all the rent due from him and also to deposit 
regularly till the final decision of the case, before the 5th day of each month, 
the monthly rent which subsequently becomes due either on the first hearing 
of proceeding or as soon thereafter as may be but before issues are framed. In 
case of any dispute as to the amount of rent due, the Rent Controller shall 
determine such amount approximately. From the bare reading of subsection 8, 
it is manifestly clear that a direction thereunder can only be given to the 
tenant. Since at the very outset, the petitioner denied the existence of 
relationship of landlord and tenant, so it was incumbent for the Rent Controller 
to first frame preliminary issue to this effect in order to determine the 
existence of relationship of landlord and tenant between the petitioner and 
“respondent” or otherwise.  
8.  
It is trite law that in case of denial of relationship in the ejectment 
petition, if it is determined by the Rent Controller that there exists relationship 
of landlord and tenant between the petitioner and “respondent”, the latter 
should have been evicted straight away on determination of relationship. The 
Rent Controller cannot proceed mechanically with the proceedings and pass an 
order under section 17 (8) of the “Act, 1963” without being satisfied that there 
exists relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties before it. As per 
preamble, the provisions of “Act, 1963” can only be invoked for the control of 
rents of certain class of buildings within the limits of cantonment areas, 
eviction of tenants therefrom and for matters connected therewith. The 
purpose and object of the “Act, 1963” is to control and regulate the matters 
interse tenant and landlord. The Rent Controller, thus, cannot travel beyond 
the ambit of “Act, 1963”.  In order to exercise the jurisdiction under the “Act, 
1963”, the existence of relationship of landlord and tenant interse parties is 
sine qua non. To this effect, guidance can be sought from Mian UMAR

W.PNo.3843 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
IKRAM-UL-HAQUE v. Dr. SHAHIDA HASNAIN and another (2016 SCMR 
2186). The relevant extract from the same is reproduced below: - 
5. 
The Ordinance was repealed by the Punjab Rented Premises 
Ordinance, 2007 which finally culminated into the Act. Again, in this 
special law (the Act) the jurisdiction of the Rent Tribunal is restricted to 
disputes which are covered by the Act in terms of subject matter, parties 
and territorial jurisdiction. Subject matter jurisdiction includes non-
agricultural residential or non-residential buildings or rented land whereas 
in terms of territorial jurisdiction it is the same as the extent of the 
jurisdiction of the Rent Tribunal under the previous law. With respect to 
parties, as was the case under the earlier law, the Rent Tribunal would only 
assume jurisdiction over a matter once the jurisdictional threshold is 
crossed by establishing that the matter involves a landlord and tenant. 
'Tenant' has been defined in section 2(l) to mean as under:- 
"…a person who undertakes or is bound to pay rent as 
consideration for the occupation of a premises by him or by any 
other person on his behalf and includes; 
(i) 
a person who continues to be in occupation of the premises 
after the termination of his tenancy for the purpose of a 
proceeding under this Act; 
(ii) Legal heirs of a tenant in the event of death of the tenant who 
continue to be in occupation of the premises; and 
(iii) A sub-tenant who is in possession of the premises or part 
thereof with the written consent of the landlord…" 
Section 24 of the Act reads as under:- 
"24. Payment of rent and other dues for pending proceedings.-
--(1) If an eviction application is filed, the Rent Tribunal, while 
granting leave to contest, shall direct the tenant to deposit the rent 
due from him within a specified time, and continue to deposit the 
same in accordance with the tenancy agreement or as may be 
directed by the Rent Tribunal till the final order. 
(Emphasis supplied) 
(2) If there is a dispute as to the amount of rent due or rate of rent, 
the Rent Tribunal shall tentatively determine the dispute and pass 
the order for deposit of the rent in terms of subsection (1). 
(3) In case the tenant has not paid a utility bill, the Rent Tribunal 
shall direct the tenant to pay the utility bill. 
(4) If a tenant fails to comply with a direction or order of the Rent 
Tribunal, the Rent Tribunal shall forthwith pass the final order." 
Through the impugned judgment the learned High Court has tried to 
resolve the question at hand by dwelling upon the larger scheme of the new 
rent laws by trying to decipher the latent intent of the legislature, which in 
our view was completely unnecessary because the answer to the question is 

5 
 
 
 
W.PNo.3843 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
quite patent. A plain reading of section 24 of the Act reproduced 
hereinabove makes it clear that a direction is not to be issued to the 
respondent of an eviction application but to a tenant. The use of the word 
'tenant' as opposed to 'respondent' speaks to the legislative intent. This 
usage appears to be conscious and deliberate, because elsewhere in the Act 
where the parties to a lis are meant to be referred to without identifying 
their legal characters, the words 'applicant' and 'respondent' are used 
instead of 'landlord' and 'tenant' (see Sections 19, 21 and 22 etc.). Where 
there is a specific intention to do so and the attending context requires that 
the parties be referred to by their legal status, the legislature has used the 
words 'landlord' and 'tenant' (see sections 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 
24 etc.). It is a settled canon of statutory interpretation that where a statute 
uses a particular word(s), the presumption is that such word(s) is 
illustrative of the legislative intent unless there are very cogent reasons to 
displace the same and in our view, there are no such reasons that justify 
interpreting section 24 of the Act in a way that defeats its express meaning. 
Therefore, it follows that where the relationship of landlord and tenant is 
denied, the Rent Tribunal would lack jurisdiction, on account of the 
doctrine of jurisdictional fact, to pass an order for payment of rent due 
under section 24 of the Act until and unless the Tribunal positively 
ascertains the relationship of tenancy and establishes that the respondent to 
the eviction application is in fact a 'tenant' in terms of section 2(l) of the 
Act. As regards the argument of the learned counsel for the respondent that 
where there is a contumacious denial by the respondent of an eviction 
application the Rent Tribunal should pass an order for payment of rent due, 
suffice it to say that contumacious denial of the relationship of tenancy 
would form the basis for declining relief to the respondent. Where the 
denial, prima facie, appears to be tainted and contumacious, the Rent 
Controller would refrain from granting leave to the respondent as a matter 
of right and course, in a perfunctory manner. Instead, when the Rent 
Tribunal, without framing an issue, concludes that the denial is 
contumacious in nature, it may refuse to grant leave and allow the eviction 
application. Whilst so doing, the Tribunal can simultaneously pass an order 
under section 24 of the Act finally determining the rent due from the tenant 
and direct that the same be deposited/paid. However, where once leave has 
been granted and the Tribunal has first to decide the question of its own 
jurisdiction, then in that eventuality, on account of the clear provisions of 
section 24 ibid read with the definition of the word 'tenant' appearing in the 
Act, the Rent Tribunal is precluded from passing an order without first 
determining the jurisdictional fact. Once the relationship of tenancy has 
been denied the jurisdiction of the Rent Tribunal has essentially been called 
into question and needs to be resolved before the Tribunal can proceed to 
pass an order for payment of rent due. It needs to be appreciated that the 
there is a distinction between an issue as to the very authority to adjudicate 
and those issues which may arise as between the parties. The Rent 
Controller must first establish relationship of landlord and tenant. 
Objections "to" proceedings must be distinguished from objections "in" the 
proceedings. Issue of jurisdiction may be raised by a party but it only 
concerns the court and the party over whom it is asked to assume 
jurisdiction. To hold otherwise would be to defeat the express intention of 
the statute, which is that an order for payment of rent due should only be 
passed against a tenant, and not merely a respondent of an eviction 
application. The relationship of landlord and tenant is an essential question 
which has a direct effect upon the assumption and exercise of the 
jurisdiction of the Rent Tribunal, which (question) must necessarily be 
positively ascertained before passing an order for payment of rent due

under section 24 of the Act. The judgment of the High Court reported as 
Farrukh Nadeem v. Muhammad Ahmad Khan and another (2009 MLD 
955) relied upon by the learned counsel for the respondent to the effect that 
where there is a contumacious denial an order under section 13(6) of the 
Ordinance can be passed is bad law which cannot be sustained, thus this 
judgment is set aside. It may however be mentioned here that where default 
in the payment of rent is set out as a ground in the eviction application, the 
relationship of tenancy is denied by the respondent, leave is granted to the 
respondent of the case, an issue in this context is framed, evidence is led by 
the parties, and the Rent Tribunal comes to the conclusion that such 
relationship exists, the Tribunal by applying the principles of estoppel and 
the rule of forfeiture of tenancy shall straightaway pass an order of eviction 
against the respondent/tenant and shall also pass the final order regarding 
the amount of rent due to the landlord which the respondent (adjudged as a 
tenant) is obliged to pay, and such order shall be executable against the 
tenant, besides the execution of the eviction. However where grounds 
envisaged by section 15 of the Act other than default are raised in an 
eviction application, obviously the Rent Tribunal after deciding the issue of 
relationship of tenancy and finding in favour of the landlord may frame 
further issues on merits and at that point of time pass an order under 
section 24 ibid. 
In the case of ASHIQ HUSSAIN and another v. JAMIA MASJID HANFIA 
GHOUSIA through President (PLD 2007 Lahore 283), this Court reiterated 
the above principles in the following words: - 
4.  
I have heard learned counsel for the parties. The Order under section 
13(6) could only be passed, where either the relationship of landlord and 
tenant is admitted or it is established from the record that the denial by the 
respondent is contumacious, illusionary frivolous, baseless and without 
substance. In this behalf, cogent reasons should be recorded by the Rent 
Controller, before discarding the denial and passing the order under section 
13(6) of the Rent Restriction Ordinance. But once a tenant has denied such 
relationship and issue in this behalf is intended to be framed by the 
Controller, it is not permissible for him to pass an order under section 13(6), 
directing the tenant to deposit the rent, because in the case, where default in 
the payment of rent is set out as a ground for the eviction, as in the present 
case, the respondent of the case, while denying the relationship takes a grave 
risk, that in case the tenancy is established, the matter shall not be further 
adjudicated, rather his tenancy shall be forfeited and straightaway an 
ejectment order shall be passed against him. As mentioned above, the 
ejectment application in the case, has been filed inter alia on the ground of 
default in the payment of monthly rent therefore, the Rent Controller after 
deciding the issue of tenancy could evict the tenant forthwith, if it is, proved 
that the relationship inter se the parties exists. Moreover in the case, where 
the tenancy is denied, the Rent Controller is not supposed to frame any other 
issue, such as on the ground of personal requirement or wilful default in the 
payment of the rent. To this extent, also the order framing issues Nos.2 and 
3, is not proper and the same is also liable to be set aside, resultantly, by 
allowing this appeal, the impugned orders are set aside and the matter is 
remanded to the Rent Controller with the direction that the evidence of the 
parties be recorded on the issue of relationship and to decide the eviction 
application on the basis of that issue within three months from the date of 

7 
 
 
 
W.PNo.3843 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
first appearance of the parties, who are directed to appear before the Rent 
Controller on 6-11-2006. 
9.   
After having an overview of the principles laid down hereinabove 
in the cited judgments, there can be no second opinion that when once a 
respondent in the ejectment petition denies the existence of relationship of 
landlord and tenant, it becomes obligatory for Rent Controller to frame a 
preliminary issue to that effect so as to determine the relationship interse 
parties in the first instance. Needless to observe that if by virtue of deliberation 
on such issue, ultimately the tenancy is established, the matter shall not be 
further adjudicated and the respondent should be confronted straight away 
with an ejectment order. 
10.  
So far as contention of learned counsel for the petitioner that the 
impugned order being interlocutory is not amenable to constitutional 
jurisdiction, it is observed that though in ordinary course, the constitutional 
jurisdiction should not be exercised against an interlocutory or interim order as 
a run-of-the-mill case but when such order, at the face of it, is patently 
perverse and appears to be suffering with illegalities, the jurisdiction of High 
Court under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 cannot be abdicated or abridged. Needless to observe that 
though scope of constitutional jurisdiction against an interim order is limited 
but when once Court reaches at the conclusion that the order/action under 
challenge is fraught with illegalities as to alter the justice, it cannot sit as a 
silent spectator to perpetuate a void order. Reference in this regard can be 
made to MUHAMMAD SUMAK MALIK and another v. MUHAMMAD ASIF 
KHAN and 3 others (2020 CLC 768) and Mst. ZAHIDA PERVEEN v. 
IFTIKHAR HUSSAIN and 2 others (2019 YLR 474).  
11.   
For the foregoing reasons, this petition is allowed with no order as 
to costs. Resultantly, impugned order dated 18th October, 2021 is set aside 
being illegal and unlawful. As a sequel, the Additional Rent Controller, 
Chaklala Cantonment Board, Rawalpindi shall first frame a preliminary issue 
with regard to existence of relationship of landlord and tenant between the 
petitioner and respondent and after determining the existence of relationship of 

8 
 
 
 
W.PNo.3843 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
landlord and tenant or otherwise interse parties, shall then proceed in 
accordance with law, especially keeping in view the observations recorded 
hereinabove. Parties are directed to appear before learned Additional Rent 
Controller, Chaklala Cantonment Board, Rawalpindi on 27.02.2023.
