Respondent No.3. 
 
Crl. Misc. No.718/2023 
  
 
The Applicant (Syed Fahad Sheraz) and eight others, 
claiming to be the followers (Mureedain) of Sheikh Muhammad Amin 
bin Abdul Rehman, filed Crl. Misc. No.1941/2023 under section 491 
Cr.P.C. in this Court for the recovery of their spiritual leader from the 
alleged illegal and improper custody of Respondent No.3. This Court 
directed the SHO, Police Station Shah Rukn-e-Alam, Multan, to produce 
the alleged detenue on 03.04.2023. He reported that he was of advanced 
age and extremely ill, and the doctors had advised him not to leave his 
house. The Applicant and his associates characterized the SHO’s report 
as false, mala fide and collusive, so this Court, with the consent of 
Respondent No.3, appointed a local commission to go to Muhammad 
Amin’s place on 5.4.2023 at 11:00 a.m. and record his statement in 
writing and also make a video clip thereof. On 6.4.2023, the local 
commissioner submitted his report along with Muhammad Amin’s 
thumb-marked statement and ScanDisk 32 GB Ultra Flair USB 3.0 
(BM2212005758Z) (hereinafter referred to as the “USB”) containing its 
video footage, which the Court made part of the file. The same day, after 
hearing the learned counsel and viewing the video recording, the Court 
dismissed the habeas corpus petition holding that it was mala fide. The 
Applicant has assailed this Court’s order dated 6.4.2023 in the Supreme 
Court and wants a copy of the USB for use in that proceeding. The Copy 
Branch refused to issue it. Hence, this application.

Heard. 
According 
to 
Merriam-Webster 
Dictionary, 
“document” means: (a) an original or official paper relied on as the 
basis, proof, or support of something; (b) something (such as a 
photograph or a recording) that serves as evidence or proof; (c) a writing 
conveying information (such as financial or historical documents);  
(d) a material substance (such as a coin or stone) having on it a 
representation of thoughts by means of some conventional mark or 
symbol; (e) a computer file containing information input by a computer 
user and usually created with an application (such as a spreadsheet or 
word processor). 
3. 
 
Let’s now have a look at some statutory definitions. Section 
29 PPC defines “document” as follows: 
29. 
“Document”. The word “document” denotes any matter 
expressed or described upon any substance by means of letters, 
figures or marks, or by more than one of those means, intended to be 
used, or which may be used, as evidence of that matter. 
Explanation 1. 
It is immaterial by what means or upon what 
substance the letters, figures or marks are formed, or whether the 
evidence is intended for, or may be used in, a Court of Justice or not. 
Illustrations 
A writing expressing the terms of a contract, which may be used as 
evidence of the contract, is a document.  
A cheque upon a banker is a document. A Power-of-Attorney is a 
document. 
A map or plan which is intended to be used or which may be used as 
evidence, is a document. 
A writing containing direction or instruction is a document. 
Explanation 2. 
Whatever is expressed by means of letters, 
figures or marks as explained by mercantile or other usage, shall be 
deemed to be expressed by such letters, figures or marks within the 
meaning of this section although the same may not be actually 
expressed. 
Illustration 
A writes his name on back of a bill of exchange payable to his order. 
The meaning of the endorsement, as explained by mercantile usage, is 
that the bill is to be paid to the holder. The endorsement is a 
document, and must be construed in the same manner as if the words 
“pay to the holder” or words to that effect had been written over the 
signature.  
4. 
 
Article 2(1)(b) of Qanun-e-Shahadat 1984 (“QSO") defines 
“document” in almost the same words as section 29 PPC though it gives 
its own Illustrations. For facility of reference, it is reproduced below: 

Crl. Misc. No.718/2023 in

Crl. Misc. No.1941/H/2023 
 
2. 
Interpretation. (1) In this Order, unless there is anything 
repugnant in the subject or context. 
(b) 
“Document” means any matter expressed or described upon 
any substance by means of letters, figures or marks, or by more than 
one of those means, intended to be used, or which may be used, for 
the purpose of recording that matter. 
Illustrations 
A writing is a document; 
Words printed, lithographed or photographed are documents; 
A map or plan is a document;  
An inscription on a metal plate or stone is a document; 
A caricature is a document. 
5. 
 
Section 3(16) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 states: 
(16) 
“Document” shall include any matter written, expressed or 
described upon any substance by means of letters, figures or marks, or 
by more than one of those means which is intended to be used, or 
which may be used, for the purpose of recording that matter. 
6. 
 
Finally, I may refer to section 2(m) of the Electronic 
Transactions Ordinance, 2002, which defines “electronic  document.” It 
reads: 
“electronic document” includes documents, records, information, 
communications or transactions in electronic form. 
7. 
 
The last-mentioned two definitions are inclusive. In Central 
Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd. v. Brojo Nath Ganguly  
(AIR 1966 SC 1571), the Supreme Court of India ruled that where an 
interpretation clause defines words to “mean” a particular thing, the 
definition is explanatory and prima facie restrictive. On the other hand, 
when it defines a term to “include” something, the definition is 
extensive. An explanatory and restrictive definition confines the 
meaning of the word defined to what is stated in the interpretation 
clause, while an extensive definition expands or extends its meaning to 
encompass what would not have understood in the ordinary sense. 
8. 
 
After 
analyzing 
all the 
statutes mentioned 
above  
(excluding the Electronic Transactions Ordinance 2002), a Division 
Bench of the Sindh High Court decided in Government of Sindh 
through Advocate General, Sindh v. Farad Naseem and others  
(2002 PCr.LJ 1765) that document includes a video. It held:

Crl. Misc. No.1941/H/2023 
 
“There can be no two opinions on the point that a still photograph is a 
document I, therefore, do not find any reason to exclude the movie 
film, which is also a photograph, from the purview of document. The 
contention that the movie contains such material, the display whereof 
is an offence under section 8(c) [of the Anti-Terrorism Act] and 
therefore, it is merely a crime article and not a document is also 
untenable. It can be illustrated by an example. If a pamphlet, a banner, 
a booklet or an advertisement contains such material, the publication, 
distribution, display or exhibition whereof is an offence, it may be 
treated as a crime article. However, it will not loose its character as a 
documents and whenever produced in evidence in Court, it shall be 
treated as documentary evidence. The illustration can be multiplied, 
but I do not intend to do it for the sake of brevity. I am further 
supported in my above opinion by the provisions contained in Articles 
164 and 2(1)(c) of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, 
9. 
 
In Nazim Ali v. Additional Sessions Judge and others 
(2016 MLD 25), the trial court declined to provide copies of the contents 
of the Memory Card to the accused under section 265-C Cr.P.C. This 
Court set aside that order, holding that it was a “document” covered by 
section 265-C and the accused was entitled to have its copy. 
10. 
 
In Ziyauddin Burhanuddin Bukhari v. Brijmohan 
Ramdass Mehra and others (AIR 1975 SC 1788), the Supreme Court of 
India held that the tape records of speeches were “documents”, as 
defined by section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872,1 which stood on 
no different footing than photographs, and that they were admissible in 
evidence on satisfying the conditions enumerated in the judgment. In 
Shamsher Singh Verma v. State of Haryana [(2016) 15 SCC 485], it 
ruled that CD is a “document” within the meaning of section 3, ibid. In 
K. Ramajayam alias Appu v. Inspector of Police, Chennai  
[2016 Cri LJ 1542 (Mad)], the High Court held that articles such as 
Memory Card, Hard Disc, CD, pen-drive etc. containing relevant data in 
electronic form are “documents” are covered under the aforesaid section. 
11. 
 
It follows from the above discussion that in general 
parlance, document means any embodiment of any text or image, 
howsoever recorded, and includes any data, text, images, sound, voice, 
codes, computer programs, software and/or databases or microfilm or 
computer generated microfiche or similar device.2 However, a statute 
may define it in a particular manner according to its aims and objectives. 
                                                 
1 The definition of the term “document” in section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, is identical with the one given in 
Article 2(1)(b) of Qanun-e-Shahadat 1984 of Pakistan.

In my opinion, in the circumstances of the instant case, ScanDisk USB 
3.0 (BM 2212005758Z) qualifies as a “document”. 
12. 
 
Article 85(3) of QSO states that documents forming part of 
the record of judicial proceedings are public documents. Article 87 
provides for the issuance of certified copies of public documents. It 
ordains that every public officer who has the custody of a public 
document, which any person has a right to inspect, shall give that person 
a copy thereof on demand, subject to payment of legal fee, if any. It 
further states that the said officer shall give a written certificate at the 
foot of such copy that it is a true copy of the document in question, and 
shall sign it with his name and official title, and also mention the date 
and affix seal thereto, if authorized. Section 548 Cr.P.C. provides that if 
any person affected by a judgment or order passed by a criminal court 
desires to have its copy or of any deposition or other part of the record, it 
shall be furnished to him on his application, subject to payment of fees, 
unless the court for some special reason, thinks fit to deliver it free of 
cost. 
13. 
 
In the present case, Crl. Misc. No.1941/2023 was a habeas 
petition under section 491 Cr.P.C. In paragraph 5 of the order dated 
6.4.2023, this Court expressly made the USB containing the video 
footage of Muhammad Amin’s statement a part of the judicial record. 
The said USB is now a public document and the Applicant, who was a 
party to the proceedings, is entitled to have its certified copy. 
Accordingly, the office is directed to provide it to him. 
14. 
 
Admittedly, the Lahore High Court Copy Branch does not 
have any defined procedure for the issuance of a certified copy of a 
USB. Therefore, seeking support from the law relating to the supply of 
certified copies of paper documents, it is directed as follows: 
(i) 
The data in USB will be provided on an un-editable 
Compact Disc (CD), ensuring that no changes can be 
made to the digital copy. 
(ii) 
A text file shall be inserted in the said Compact Disc 
containing the particulars, which the Copy Branch 
Agency stamps on every certified copy of the paper 
document it issues. These are:

under the above table. 
(iv) 
The applicant shall be liable to pay the cost of the 
aforesaid certified copy. 
15. 
 
According to Rule 6 (v) Part-B of Chapter 5 of Volume-V 
of Rules & Orders of Lahore High Court, Lahore, every application for 
an attested copy will be entertained subject to deposit of cost in advance 
as may be fixed by the Hon’ble Chief Justice from time to time. The sum 
so deposited is adjusted at the time of delivery of copy. Hence, the 
authority to fix the cost for the supply of a certified copy of the USB lies 
with the Hon’ble Chief Justice. The office shall place the matter before 
His Lordship for an order in this regard. 
16. 
 
This application is disposed of in the above terms.
