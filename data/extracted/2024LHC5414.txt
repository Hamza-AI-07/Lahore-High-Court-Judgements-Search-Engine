JUDGMENT 
Date of Hearing 
26.11.2024 
Petitioner  by: 
Mr. Qamar uz Zaman Butt, Advocate. 
 
Respondent No. 1 by: 
Malik Aamir Javed Bhutta, Assistant 
Attorney General. 
Respondents No. 2 to 5 by:  Sardar Riaz Karim, Advocate with Ch. 
Hafeez Ullah Gujjar, Legal Officer, NBP, 
Multan.  
ABID HUSSAIN CHATTHA, J. This constitutional Petition is directed 
against the impugned Orders dated 17.02.2021, 24.06.2021 & 29.12.2021 
passed by Functionaries of the National Bank of Pakistan (the “NBP”).  
2.  
Precisely, the Petitioner was employed as OG-III / Cash Officer on 
contract basis on 12.08.2016 for a period of three years. The contract was 
renewed from time to time. Vide impugned Order dated 17.02.2021, the 
Petitioner was dismissed from service with immediate effect. The Petitioner 
filed W.P. No. 3669 of 2021 challenging the dismissal Order which was 
disposed of vide Order dated 10.03.2021 by transmitting the Petition to the 
concerned Respondent of the NBP to decide the same in accordance with law. 
Acting upon the same, the impugned Order dated 24.06.2021 was passed, 
whereby, representation of the Petitioner was dismissed by holding that the 
Cash Internee Certificate purportedly issued by Zarai Tarraqiati Bank Limited 
(the “ZTBL”) submitted by the Petitioner at the time of his appointment was 
not verified by the ZTBL, hence, the Petitioner was dismissed on account of 
submitting fake antecedent pursuant to clause 5.6 of his appointment letter. 
Aggrieved from the same, the Petitioner filed W.P. No. 14150 of 2021 which 
was disposed of vide Order dated 25.10.2021 directing the concerned 

2  
W.P. No. 1050 of 2022  
Respondent of the NBP to decide pending appeal of the Petitioner, which was 
later dismissed vide impugned Order dated 29.12.2021 on the same ground that 
the Petitioner failed to provide any record verified by the Head Office of ZTBL 
regarding genuineness of his Cash Internee Certificate dated 29.06.2016 
purportedly issued by the Branch Manager of ZTBL, Mian Channu Branch. 
Hence, this Petition.  
3.  
At the very outset, learned counsel for the Respondent Bank objected to 
the maintainability of this Petition while submitting that the Petitioner was 
appointed on 12.08.2016 on contract basis and was dismissed on 17.02.2021 as 
contractual employee, therefore, he cannot invoke the constitutional 
jurisdiction of this Court and the only remedy available to him is to file a civil 
suit questioning his alleged unlawful termination. He further stated that since 
currently the National Bank of Pakistan (Staff) Service Rules, 2021 (the 
“Rules, 2021”) are in force which have been held as non-statutory in case 
titled, “Umar Asghar Qureshi and another v. Federation of Pakistan and 3 
others” (2024 PLC (C.S.) 640), therefore, this Petition is not maintainable. He 
also asserted that even otherwise, this Petition involves determination of 
disputed facts which cannot be resolved in exercise of constitutional 
jurisdiction of this Court. He relied upon cases “Owais Shams Durrani and 
others v. Vice Chancellor, Bacha Khan University, Charsadda and another” 
(2020 SCMR 1041), “Federation of Pakistan, Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry, Karachi v. Ali Ahmed Qureshi” (2001 SCMR 1733) and “Dr. 
Ishaque Muhammad Shah v. President, National Bank of Pakistan and 2 
others” (2010 PLC (C.S.) 748).  
4.  
Conversely, learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the Rules, 
2021 came into effect on 01.04.2021 as held in the case of Umar Asghar 
Qureshi (supra), whereas, the Petitioner was dismissed on 17.02.2021 when the 
statutory National Bank of Pakistan (Staff) Services Rule, 1973 (the “Rules, 
1973”) were in force. As such, the Petitioner even as a contractual employee 
can invoke the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court. He stated that even 
otherwise, no disputed fact is involved and according to record, it is an 
admitted fact that the Petitioner has been arbitrarily dismissed in terms of 
clause 5.6 of his appointment letter without issuance of any show cause notice, 
framing of charge sheet and confronting with him the allegation of presenting 

3  
W.P. No. 1050 of 2022  
fake Internship Certificate at the time of securing his job. Moreover, the effect 
of clause 5.7 of his appointment letter has been completely ignored which 
stipulates the time period for verification of antecedents.  
5.  
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
6.  
It is an admitted fact that the Petitioner was employed on contract basis 
on 12.08.2016 for a period of three years and his contract was extended from 
time to time until he was abruptly and arbitrarily dismissed vide letter dated 
17.02.2021. On the date of his dismissal from service, the non-statutory Rules, 
2021 were not in force, rather the statutory Rules, 1973 were applicable. For 
reference, see Umar Asghar Qureshi case (supra); “Muhammad Tariq Badr and 
another v. National Bank of Pakistan and others” (2013 SCMR 314); and 
“Muhammad 
Tariq 
Khan 
v. 
National 
Bank 
of 
Pakistan 
through 
President/CEO, etc.” (PLJ 2024 Lahore 376). As such, this Petition was 
maintainable.  
7.  
It is apparent from the record that the Petitioner was not issued any show 
cause notice, charge sheet or confronted with the charge that he presented a 
fake Internship Certificate at the time of his appointment in 2016. In fact, the 
allegation was revealed when in compliance of Order dated 10.03.2021 passed 
in W.P. No. 3669 of 2021, the impugned Order dated 24.06.2021 was passed 
and later, the same allegation was confirmed through the impugned Order 
dated 29.12.2021.  
8.  
It is the case of the Respondent Bank that it could legitimately and 
lawfully terminate service of the Petitioner by invoking clause 5.6 of his 
appointment letter which entitled the Respondent Bank to terminate service of 
the Petitioner upon discovery of any false information provided at the time of 
appointment. However, the effect of clause 5.7 of the appointment letter was 
conveniently ignored. The controversy can be resolved by conjunctively 
reading clauses 5.6 & 5.7 of the appointment letter which are reproduced as 
under:- 
5.6  
In case it is discovered at any time that you willfully 
suppressed any material information about yourself viz. education 
qualifications, age, post-employment details such as pay, job title, 
service record etc. or if it is discovered that disclosures made by 
you at the time of selection or thereafter are false in any respect, 
you will be liable to immediate dismissal from the Bank’s service. 
In that event the Bank will be in its right to demand damages if 
any sustained by the Bank. 

4  
W.P. No. 1050 of 2022  
5.7  
Time period for verification of antecedents & education 
testimonials approved by the Board is three months form the date 
of joining the Bank’s service. No fresh advance/staff finance and 
other benefits will be allowed / sanctioned till verification of 
antecedents.  
9.  
It is explicitly evident from the above that the Petitioner rendered service 
from the date of his appointment on 12.08.2016 till the date of his termination 
on 17.02.2021 i.e. for more than four years without any allegation when 
statedly clause 5.6 was arbitrarily and unilaterally invoked without reference to 
the Petitioner completely ignoring that antecedents in terms of clause 5.7 of the 
letter of appointment could only be verified within three months from the date 
of his joining the service with the NBP. Admittedly, the Respondent Bank did 
not invoke the termination simpliciter clause 5.3 of the appointment letter 
which allowed termination by either side on three months’ notice or pay in lieu 
thereof, rather, the NBP terminated the service of the Petitioner on allegation of 
misconduct in violation of clause 5.2 (a) of the appointment letter, which 
mandated issuance of show cause notice and holding of inquiry which 
admittedly was not undertaken in the case of the Petitioner. Thus, the service of 
the Petitioner was dispensed with by attaching a stigma for which he was not 
accorded with a fair opportunity to defend himself, particularly, when the Cash 
Internee Certificate was issued by the Branch Manager of ZTBL at Mian 
Channun but the NBP sought its verification from the head Office of ZTBL. As 
such, the dismissal Order of the Petitioner was based on mala fide in violation 
of his appointment letter.  
10. 
In view of above, this constitutional Petition is allowed; the impugned 
Orders dated 17.02.2021, 24.06.2021 & 29.12.2021 are set aside being illegal 
and unlawful; and the Petitioner is reinstated into service with all permissible 
back benefits. No Order as to costs.
