Date of hearing:     11.10.2023. 
Applicant by: 
Malik Abdullah Raza, Advocate. 
Respondent(s) by: Mr. Shoaib Rashid, Advocate.  
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.- Through 
instant Reference Application under Section 133 of the Income Tax 
Ordinance, 2001 (“the Ordinance of 2001”), following question of 
law, urged to have arisen out of impugned order dated 22.02.2022, 
passed by learned Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue, Lahore 
Bench, Lahore (“Appellate Tribunal”), has been pressed for our 
opinion:- 
“Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned 
Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (“Appellate Tribunal”) has erred 
in law by failing to consider the definition of ‘turnover’ under the 
provisions of Section 113(3) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 
(“the Ordinance”) which includes the freight charges, terminal 
charges, shipment handling charges, payment of duties and other 
taxes under the term gross turnover?”  
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that respondent-taxpayer, a private 
limited company, filed return for the tax year 2018 declaring 
taxable income of Rs.6,994,058/-, which was treated as an 
assessment order in terms of Section 120 of the Ordinance of 2001, 
however, it was found to be erroneous insofar as prejudicial to the 
interest of revenue. Consequently, the assessment was amended 
vide order dated 17.12.2021, levying turnover tax @ 1.25%, which 
was endorsed by CIR (Appeals) vide order dated 10.02.2022. In 
second appeal, Appellate Tribunal vacated both the aforesaid 
orders. Hence, instant Reference Application.

3. 
Learned Legal Advisor for applicant-department submits that 
freight charges, terminal charges, shipment handling charges, duties 
and taxes were part of invoiced amount(s), hence construable as 
gross receipts, and said amounts cannot be excluded from the ambit 
of turnover as defined in clause (a) sub-section (3) of section 113 of 
the Ordinance of 2001. He adds that there was no legal justification 
available with learned Appellate Tribunal to hold that only the fee, 
claimable as service charges could be recognized as taxable for the 
purposes of minimum tax liability. Lastly, he submits that 
impugned order is illegal and liable to be set aside.  
4. 
Contrarily, learned counsel for respondent-taxpayer defends 
the impugned order by contending that learned Legal Advisor for 
applicant-department has failed to point out any illegality or legal 
infirmity therein. Adds that case of the taxpayer falls within clause 
(b) of sub-section (3) of section 113 of Ordinance of 2001 since 
taxpayer is a service provider and charges fees for rendering 
services, and all other amounts, erroneously treated as part of the 
turnover, are otherwise reimbursable expense, incurred at the behest 
of the recipient of service.        
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused.  
6. 
Perusal of record reveals that respondent-taxpayer was 
engaged in the business of freight forwarding by air and sea to and 
from Pakistan (also customs house brokerage, road freight, fleet 
management, overland export, warehousing and related services). 
The controversy involves charge of minimum tax on the turnover of 
respondent-taxpayer. Section 113 of the Ordinance of 2001 
provides mechanism for computation of minimum tax which is 
determinable in terms of the volume of turnover and the limits 
whereof are prescribed therein, which is reproduced hereunder 
for ease of reference:- 
“113. Minimum tax on the income of certain persons.- (1) ….. 
(2) ….. 
(3) “turnover” means, 
(a) the gross sales or gross receipts, exclusive of Sales Tax and 
Federal Excise duty or any trade discounts shown on invoices, or

bills, derived from the sale of goods, and also excluding any amount 
taken as deemed income and is assessed as final discharge of the 
tax liability for which tax is already paid or payable; 
(b) the gross fees for the rendering of services for giving 
benefits including commissions; except covered by final 
discharge of tax liability for which tax is separately paid or 
payable; 
(c) the gross receipts from the execution of contracts; except 
covered by final discharge of tax liability for which tax is separately 
paid or payable; and 
(d) the company’s share of the amounts stated above of any 
association of persons of which the company is a member.” 
     (emphasis supplied) 
7. 
The turnover, in terms of clause (b) of subsection (3) of 
section 113 of the Ordinance, means the gross fees paid for 
rendering of services other than those covered by final discharge 
of tax liability, for which tax is separately paid or payable. 
Fundamental question is whether the amounts, comprising of 
freight charges, terminal charges, shipment handling charges 
payment of duties and other taxes (‘other amounts’), otherwise 
distinguishable from the fees paid in lieu of rendering of services 
in terms of clause (b) of sub-section (3) of section 113 of the 
Ordinance of 2001, could be treated as gross receipts. Factually, 
the claim of reimbursement of other amounts is not disputed. If 
construction proposed by learned counsel for the department is 
acknowledged – to treat other amounts and the service fees as 
part of gross receipts -, it would not only render clause (b) of sub-
section (3) of section 113, ibid, redundant but conspicuously 
distort the meaning and effect of sub-clause (b) of clause (v) of 
sub-section (7) of section 153 of the Ordinance of 2001, and 
violates 
the 
ratio 
settled 
through 
various 
judicial 
pronouncements, wherein the term “gross fee” was elucidated. 
There is no cavil that the term “gross fee”, in the context of 
rendering of or providing of services, would exclude 
reimbursable expenses for the purposes of ascertaining the 
volume of the “turnover”. Accordingly, it is the gross fee and not 
the gross receipts, which shall be treated as part of turnover for 
the purposes of commuting the minimum tax liability in terms of 

 
 
ITR No.73773 of 2022

clause (b) of sub-section (3) of section 113, ibid, and amounts 
comprising of freight charges, terminal charges, shipment 
handling charges payment of duties and other taxes have had to 
be excluded for the purposes of turnover in terms of clause (b) of 
sub-section (3) of section 113 of the Ordinance of 2001. It is not 
the case of the department that amounts consisting of freight 
charges, terminal charges, shipment handling charges payment of 
duties and other taxes were treated as part of gross receipts for 
the purposes of deduction of withholding tax in terms of sub-
section (1) of section 153 of the Ordinance of 2001.     
8. 
We endorse the determination by Appellate Tribunal, which 
rightly differed with the determinations by the CIR (Appeals) and 
Commissioner, which had erroneously treated the amounts, 
comprising of freight charges, terminal charges, shipment 
handling charges payment of duties and other taxes, in addition to 
the gross fee for rendering services, as part of gross receipts. 
Learned Legal Advisor for applicant-department has failed to point 
out any illegality or legal infirmity in the order passed by learned 
Appellate Tribunal, which even otherwise is unexceptionable, thus, 
needs no interference. 
9. 
In view of the above, our answer to the purposed questions is 
in negative i.e., against applicant-department and in favour of 
respondent-taxpayer. 
 
This  Reference Application is decided against applicant-
department.  
10. 
Office shall send a copy of this judgment under seal of the 
Court to learned Appellate Tribunal as per Section 133 (5) of the 
Ordinance of 2001.
