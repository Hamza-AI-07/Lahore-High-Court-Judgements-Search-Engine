Shahid Karim, J:-. This constitutional petition brings a 
challenge to the order dated 01.04.2024 passed by a bench 
of Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).  Respondent 
No.3 filed an application for recounting of votes under 
Section 95 of the Election Act, 2017 (“The 2017 Act”).  
This application was filed on 10.02.2024.  Prior to this an 
application on 09.02.2024 had been filed with the Returning 
Officer seeking recount of votes.  The Returning Officer 
rejected the application on grounds which are not relevant 
for our purposes.  As adumbrated, on 10.02.2024 respondent 
No.3 brought an application before ECP for recount by 
invoking the provisions of section 95 of the 2017 Act.  The 
facts culled out from the impugned order clearly show that 
the matter was fixed for hearing on 12.02.2024 and on 
15.02.2024 the Returning Officer sent a detailed report 
which did not satisfy the bench of ECP and further 
investigation was sought to be made in the matter.  For the 

W.P No.23249 of 2024

purpose, an inquiry committee was constituted to submit its 
report within seven days.  It is pertinent to mention that the 
issue relates to elections to the constituency PP-133 
Nankana Sahib-II.  While directing constitution of an 
inquiry committee, the notification of returned candidate 
(the petitioner) was suspended till the decision of the matter.  
In the meantime the Final Consolidated Result (Form 49) 
had been sent to ECP by the Returning Officer, on 
09.02.2024.  Thereafter the impugned order has been passed 
on 01.04.2024 on the basis of report of the inquiry 
committee.  It is made clear on the threshold that this Court 
is not concerned with the merits of the case before the bench 
of ECP and is only concerned with the legality of impugned 
order and whether the jurisdictional facts existed in order to 
clothe ECP with the power to enter upon the controversy 
and to render a decision.  For the purpose, the interpretation 
of section 95(6) of the 2017 Act would be engaged which is 
the only provision which confers power on ECP to intervene 
during the process of consolidation of results.  This is the 
holding of this Court in a recent judgment passed in Ch. 
Bilal Ejaz v. Election Commission of Pakistan & others 
(W.P No.16416 of 2024). 
2. 
Section 95 of the 2017 Act provides that: 
“95. Consolidation of results.—(1) Immediately after 
announcement of provisional results, the Returning Officer 
shall give the contesting candidates and their election 
agents a notice in writing of the day, time and place fixed 
for the consolidation of the results, and, in the presence of 
such of the contesting candidates and election agents as 
may be present, consolidate in the prescribed manner the 
Results of the Count furnished by the Presiding Officers, 
including therein the postal ballots received by him before 
the time fixed for the consolidation of results: 
Provided that presence of not more than one agent of each 
candidate shall be allowed.

(2) Before consolidating the Results of the Count, the 
Returning Officer shall examine the ballot papers excluded 
from the count by the Presiding Officer and, if he finds that 
any such ballot paper should not have been so excluded, 
count it as a ballot paper cast in favour of the contesting 
candidate for whom the vote has been cast. 
 
(3) The Returning Officer shall also count the ballot papers 
received by him by post in such manner as may be 
prescribed and include the votes cast in favour of each 
contesting candidate in the Consolidated Statement except 
those which he may reject on any of the grounds mentioned 
in section 90. 
 
(4) The ballot papers rejected by the Returning Officer 
under subsection (3) shall be mentioned separately in the 
consolidated statement. 
 
(5) Before commencement of the proceedings, the 
Returning Officer shall recount the ballot papers of one or 
more polling stations if a request or challenge in writing is 
made to that effect by a contesting candidate or his 
election agent and— 
 
(a) the margin of victory between returned and 
runner up candidates is less than five percent of the 
total votes polled in the constituency or eight 
thousand votes in case of National Assembly 
constituency and four thousand votes in case of a 
Provincial Assembly constituency, as the case may 
be, whichever is less; or 
 
(b) the number of votes excluded from the count by 
the Presiding Officer are equal to or more than the 
margin of victory: 
 
Provided that the Returning Officer shall recount only once. 
 
(6) The Commission may, before conclusion of the 
consolidation proceedings and after notice to the 
contesting candidates], for reasons to be recorded, direct 
the Returning Officer to recount the ballot papers of one 
or more polling stations. 
 
(7) If there is a difference between the Results of the Count 
received from the Presiding Officers and the results of the 
recount, the Returning Officer shall record the difference 
and details thereof: 
 
Provided that where the Returning Officer has recounted 
the votes under sub-section (5) or sub-section (6), the 
consolidation proceedings shall be completed within— 
 
(a) seven days after the polling day in the case of 
elections to the National Assembly; and 
 
(b) five days after the polling day in the case of 
elections to a Provincial Assembly. 
 
(8) The Returning Officer shall, within twenty four hours 
after 
the 
consolidation 
proceedings, 
send 
to 
the 
Commission signed copies of the Consolidated Statement of 
the Results of the Count and Final Consolidated Result 

W.P No.23249 of 2024

together with Results of the Count and the Ballot Paper 
Account, as received from the Presiding Officers, and shall 
retain copies of these documents for record. 
 
(9) After consolidation of results, the Returning Officer 
shall give to such contesting candidates and their election 
agents 3 [and accredited observers] as are present during 
the consolidation proceedings a copy of the Consolidated 
Statement of the Results of the Count and the Final 
Consolidated Result sent to the Commission against proper 
receipt. 
 
(10) On receipt of documents under sub-section (8), the 
Commission shall, within fourteen days from the date of 
the poll, publish the documents on its website. 
 
3. 
The true construction of section 95 has been brought 
forth in Ch. Bilal Ejaz in the following terms: 
“12. 
Section 95 relates to consolidation of results and 
confers powers on the Returning Officer to do so 
immediately after announcement of provisional results.  
While doing so and before commencement of consolidation 
proceedings sub-section (5) confers upon the Returning 
Officer the power to order recount of ballot papers of one 
or more polling stations if a request or challenge in writing 
is made to that effect by a contesting candidate.  This is the 
power which was exercised by the Returning Officer while 
passing the order dated 10.02.2024.  Sub-section (6) is 
crucial in the present context and confers a power on ECP 
to direct the Returning Officer to recount the ballot papers 
before conclusion of consolidation proceedings.  The 
intention, in my opinion, is clear and unequivocal.  Firstly, 
a specific provision exists in the 2017 Act conferring 
powers on ECP to order the recount of ballot papers.  
Second and more importantly it has to be done before 
conclusion of the consolidation proceedings.  If this power 
is not exercised by ECP within the contours mentioned in 
sub-section (6) of section 95, it cannot thereafter proceed to 
exercise such power on the misplaced notion that it can do 
so by invoking provisions of section 8 of the 2017 Act.  In 
such matters, therefore, ECP is constrained by section 
95(6) and cannot exceed the jurisdiction so conferred.  In 
the impugned order, although ECP refers to the provisions 
of section 95(5) but ignored sub-section (6) of section 95 
which relates to the powers of ECP.  ECP went wrong and 
committed an error by stating in paragraph 14 of the 
impugned order that notwithstanding the provisions of 
section 95 (6) of the 2017 Act, the Commission may exercise 
“its inherent power to rectify any injustice committed 
during course of election”.  This view is a violation of law 
and must be discountenanced.  It cannot be sustained in 
view of the holding of the superior courts in different cases. 
It was unfortunate, in my opinion, for ECP while passing 
the impugned order to ignore the judgments of the superior 
courts in this regard and in particular the judgment by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in Zulfiqar Ali Bhatti. 
 

W.P No.23249 of 2024

4. 
From the paragraph which has been set out above it is 
clear that the holding of this Court was that the recount of 
ballot papers and the power to be exercised by ECP has to 
be done before conclusion of the consolidation proceedings.  
Further that if the exercise of power is not completed as 
contemplated by sub-section (6) of section 95, ECP cannot 
thereafter proceed to exercise such power on the misplaced 
notion that it can do so by invoking the provisions of section 
8 of the 2017 Act or any other provision in law or the 
Constitution.  The clear mandate of the judgment in Ch. 
Bilal Ejaz  was that there are no inherent powers inhering in 
ECP to rectify a purported injustice committed during 
course of election and its powers are circumscribed by the 
provisions of section 95(6) of the 2017 Act.  This is the 
distilled essence of the decision made in Ch. Bilal Ejaz. 
5. 
The facts have been narrated above in order to lend 
actuality to the analysis.  It is evident that ECP proceeded to 
exercise its powers under Section 95(6) in contravention of 
clear intent reflected in the said provision by the legislature.  
The crucial words are “before conclusion of the 
consolidation proceedings”. The consolidation proceedings 
are required to be concluded by the Returning Officer within 
five days after the polling day in the case of elections to a 
Provincial Assembly.  This is the cutoff date prescribed by 
law for the consolidation proceedings to be completed and 
this includes the processes under sub-sections (5) or (6).  
Sub-section (5) relates to the power of Returning Officer to 
recount the ballot papers and sub-section (6) of course 
relates to the powers of ECP to order recount of votes by 

W.P No.23249 of 2024 
 
6
directing the Returning Officer to do so.  There is no 
contention that the Returning Officer had rejected the 
application for recount of votes.  It was thereafter left to be 
decided by ECP whether to direct the Returning Officer to 
recount the votes or not.  ECP on its part delayed the matter 
and initiated inquiries into the entire process of election 
which, in my opinion, was not the mandate of sub-section 
(6) of section 95 of the 2017 Act.  When an application was 
made to ECP it merely had to see whether the Returning 
Officer had proceeded in accordance with law while 
refusing recount of votes under the powers conferred by sub-
section (5) of section 95 and no more.  In any case, it could 
only have done so prior to completion of the consolidation 
proceedings on 09.02.2024 by the Returning Officer. 
6. 
Learned counsel for the respondent No.3 as also ECP 
stated that the Returning Officer acted with undue haste 
while completing the consolidation proceedings.  This gives 
rise to issue of administrative nature regarding which ECP 
can take cognizance but this will not upend consolidation 
proceedings and grant license to order recount of votes in 
contravention of subsection (6) of section 95.  While issuing 
an order for setting up of an inquiry committee ECP 
suspended the notification to be issued in favour of the 
petitioner.  It is indeed unclear whether ECP could have 
passed an interim order of this nature as this would be 
tantamount to suspending the statutory provisions of sub-
section (10) of section 95 and section 98 which cannot be 
countenanced.  In a nub, these provisions require that “on 
receipt of Final Consolidated Result…..the Commission 

W.P No.23249 of 2024 
 
7
shall, within fourteen days from the date of the poll, publish 
in the official gazette the name of the contesting candidate 
who has received the highest number of votes and stands 
elected”.  Thus it does not hinge on the whims of ECP but 
the crucial document is the Final Consolidated Result upon 
which the ECP has no discretion left in the matter.  There is 
no doubt that the Returning Officer could have awaited the 
period prescribed for consolidation proceedings to be 
completed and given in proviso to sub-section (7) of section 
95 but that is for ECP to instruct the Returning Officers and 
indeed some time must be given to ECP to exercise its 
powers in terms of sub-section (6).  The provision for further 
time in this regard can only be done by an amendment in the 
law regarding which this Court is not empowered to issue a 
direction and is for the legislature to look into. 
7. 
Learned counsel for respondent No.3 relied upon case 
law to argue that this Court cannot interfere at this stage 
while the election tribunals have been set up.  Suffice to say 
that this aspect was ignored by ECP by prolonging the 
proceedings unduly as it can be seen that the hearing was 
conducted in the matter on 12.3.2024 and the impugned 
order was passed thereafter on 01.04.2024.  Moreover, the 
challenge in this petition is to an order passed by ECP 
whose sufficiency in law has to be seen by this Court in the 
present petition.  The case law relied upon is not relevant to 
the facts of the present case and need not be discussed.   
8. 
In view of the above, this petition is allowed and the 
impugned order passed by ECP is set aside.  Consequently, 

W.P No.23249 of 2024 
 
8
the notification issued on 09.04.2024 notifying the 
respondent No.3 as returned candidate is also set aside.
