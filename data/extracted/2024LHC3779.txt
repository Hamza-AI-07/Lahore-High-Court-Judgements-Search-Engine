Mr. Burhan Moazzam Malik, Advocate for the 
petitioner. 
Mr. Hammad Akbar Wallana, Special Prosecutor for 
ANF with Zahid Ali Channa, Inspector.  
 
 
Through this petition, Salman Hamid, petitioner 
supplicates post-arrest bail in case FIR No. 30/2024 
dated 28.02.2024 for offences under sections 9(1)6(e) 
and 15 of CNSA, 1997 (Amended Act, 2022) 
registered at Police Station RD ANF, Lahore.   
2.   
Pith and marrow facts of the case are that on 
28.02.2024 petitioner’s co-accused namely Adeel 
Ahmad was apprehended by the ANF officials and 
recovered 5 Kilograms heroin concealed in secrete 
cavity of his car Toyota Altis bearing Registration No. 
ALW-227 as well as a drone with its remote control 
and battery. It was further alleged that above 
mentioned co-accused disclosed upon query that he 
use drone for the supply of narcotics. On 29.02.02024 
during the investigation Adeel Ahmad co-accused also 
made disclosure that he purchased drone from Lucky 
Electronics Hall Road, Lahore owned by Salman 

2 
Crl.Misc. No. 17244-B of 2024  
 
 
 
 
Hamid petitioner. Moreover, he has also placed a 
white colour drone at the above mentioned shop for 
the purpose of repair which he can get recover on 
pointation. The above mentioned drone, as well as, 
four other drones were recovered from the possession 
of petitioner from his shop established in the name and 
style of Lucky Electronics Hall Road, Lahore by the 
investigating officer on 29.02.2024. It was further 
alleged that the petitioner facilitated his co-accused. 
Hence, this case.     
3. 
It is inter alia contended by learned counsel for 
the petitioner that the petitioner is not nominated in the 
FIR in any capacity, he has been involved in this case 
in the light of disclosure made by Adeel Ahmad, co-
accused recorded before the police; that he purchased 
drone from Lucky Electronics Hall Road, Lahore 
owned by the petitioner; that except this, there is no 
iota of evidence against the petitioner which can 
connect him with the commission of crime; that 
statement of co-accused cannot be used against the 
petitioner, even otherwise, he has not stated in his 
confessional/ in-culpatory statement dated 29.02.2024 
before the investigating officer that the petitioner was 
in league with him qua the commission of crime. 
Further submitted that business of drone is not 
prohibited in Pakistan and there is no evidence against 
the petitioner that he is involved in the trafficking of 

3 
Crl.Misc. No. 17244-B of 2024  
 
 
 
 
narcotics allegedly recovered from his co-accused 
Adeel Ahmad.      
4. 
Contrarily, Learned Special Prosecutor for ANF 
has vociferously argued that the petitioner is fully 
involved in this case because he sold drone to Adeel 
Ahmad co-accused who was using the same for the 
supply of narcotics, in this way, offence under section 
15 of CNSA, 1997 (amended Act, 2022) is fully 
applicable to his extent. Lastly submitted that this 
petition has no force and the same may kindly be 
dismissed.   
5. 
I have heard learned counsel for the petitioner as 
well as learned Special Prosecutor for ANF 
meticulously and perused the record minutely with 
their able assistance.  
6. 
After hearing learned counsel for the parties and 
going through the record it has straightaway been 
noticed by this Court that no recovery of narcotics was 
effected from the possession of petitioner. The 
narration of the FIR discloses that recovery of the 
narcotics was effected from petitioner’s co-accused 
namely Adeel Ahmed.  The petitioner has been 
involved in this case only on the statement of supra 
mentioned co-accused, which is inadmissible in 
evidence and cannot be relied upon. Moreover, 
according to Article 38 of the Qanun-e-Shahdat Order, 
1984 confession of accused before police could not be 
used against him. Section 38 of the Order ibid is 

4 
Crl.Misc. No. 17244-B of 2024  
 
 
 
 
hereby 
mentioned below for 
the purpose 
of 
facilitation:-  
“Confession to police officer not to be proved 
No confession made to a police officer shall be 
proved as against a person accused of an offence” 
 
 After visiting the archive of judicial verdicts, I have 
found a case law reported as “Raja Muhammad 
Younas v. The State” (2013 SCMR 669) wherein the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan held as under:- 
“After hearing the counsel for the parties and 
going through the record, we have noted that 
the only material implicating the petitioner is 
the statement of co-accused Amjad Mahmood, 
Constable. Under Article 38 of Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984, admission of an 
accused before police cannot be used as 
evidence against the co-accused.” 
 
 
Similarly, in case tilted as “Muhammad Sarfraz 
Ansari vs. The State and others ” (PLD 2021 SC 738) 
apex court of Pakistan has observed as infra:- 
 
“3. We have heard the learned counsel for the 
parties and have gone through the record of 
the case. We have noticed that the petitioner is 
not nominated in FIR; he has rather been 
implicated in the case by the co-accused 
Waqar Aslam, the prima facie beneficiary of 
the 
alleged 
fraud, 
in 
his 
confessional 
statement during investigation, which has 
been relied upon by the learned counsel for 
the State to oppose the prayer of the petitioner 
for bail. No doubt, as per Article 43 of the 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 when more 
persons than one are being jointly tried for the 
same offence and a confession made by one of 
such persons admitting that the offence was 
committed by them jointly, is proved, the 
court 
may 
take 
into 
consideration 
the 
confessional statement of that co-accused as 

5 
Crl.Misc. No. 17244-B of 2024  
 
 
 
 
circumstantial evidence against the other co-
accused(s). However, this Court has, in 
several cases, held that conviction of a co-
accused cannot be recorded solely on the basis 
of confessional statement of one accused 
unless there is also some other independent 
evidence corroborating such confessional 
statement. The principle ingrained in Article 
43 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat is applied at the 
bail stage and the confessional statement of an 
accused can lead the court to form a tentative 
view about prima facie involvement of his co-
accused in the commission of the alleged 
offence;  but as in the trial, at the bail stage 
also, the prima facie involvement of the co-
accused cannot be determined merely on the 
basis of confessional statement of other 
accused without any other independent 
incriminating 
material 
corroborating 
the 
confessional statement.”  
 
 
 
Moreover, in a recent pronouncement “Akhtar 
vs. Khwas Khan and another” (2024 SCMR 476) 
Supreme Court of Pakistan while deciding with such 
like case has observed as under:- 
“So far as the alleged confession of the 
petitioner 
before 
police 
during 
investigation is concerned, the niceties of 
Article 38 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 
1984 are quite lucid that no confession 
made to a police officer shall be proved as 
against a person accused of any offence, 
while Article 39 emphasizes that, subject to 
Article 40, no confession made by any 
person whilst he is in the custody of a 
police officer, unless it be made in the 
immediate presence of a Magistrate, shall 
be 
proved 
as 
against 
such 
person. 
Seemingly, a confession made before the 
police is not made admissible by dint of the 
aforesaid provisions of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984 in order to preserve 
and safeguard the philosophy of safe 
administration of criminal justice and is 

6 
Crl.Misc. No. 17244-B of 2024  
 
 
 
 
also based on public policy. In the aforesaid 
backdrop, we are sanguine that the case of 
petitioner requires further inquiry to prove 
his guilt which can only be thrashed out 
after recording of evidence in the Trial 
Court.  
 
7. 
The petitioner was arrested on 29.02.2024, one 
day after registration of FIR by the ANF officials but 
the fact remains that the contraband (5-KGs heroin) 
was not consciously/actively in possession of the 
petitioner. Under Section 6 of the Control of Narcotic 
Substances Act, 1997 possession of narcotic drugs is 
an offence, which is punishable under Section 9 of the 
said Act. Section 6 reads as under:- 
“6. Prohibition of possession of narcotic 
drug 
etc.---No 
one 
shall 
produce, 
manufacture, extract, prepare, possess, 
offer for sale, purchase, distribute, deliver 
on any terms whatsoever, transport, 
dispatch, any narcotic drug, psychotropic 
substance or controlled substance except 
for 
medical 
scientific 
or 
industrial 
purposes in the manner and subject to 
such conditions as may be specified by or 
under this Act or any  other law for the 
time being in force.” 
 
General Rule is that there is presumption that 
mens rea, an evil intention or a knowledge of 
wrongfulness of the act is an essential ingredient in 
every offence.  In other words, the prosecution is duty 
bound to prove that the accused was knowingly in 
control of something in the circumstances, which 
showed that he was assenting to being in control of it. 

7 
Crl.Misc. No. 17244-B of 2024  
 
 
 
 
There is no evidence except the oral assertion of the 
prosecution that he  facilitated in supply of heroin.  
 
8. 
I have further noted that there is no evidence on 
file against the petitioner that he had any nexus with 
recovered heroin. So far as sale and recovery of drones 
from the petitioner is concerned, the learned Special 
Prosecutor for ANF has failed to prove that sale of 
drone is prohibited in Pakistan and the petitioner was 
not legally competent to do the business of same. It is 
abundantly clear from the record that the petitioner has 
been made accused in this case merely on the basis of 
sale of drone to main accused which was allegedly 
being used by him for the supply of narcotics to his 
customers. If the petitioner can be made accused on 
the above said ground then dealer of Toyota Car 
should have also been accused of this case because 
Toyota Altis Car has allegedly been used for the 
transportation of heroin and the same has also been 
taken into possession by the investigating officer at the 
time of recovery of heroin and arrest of accused. 
 
9. 
It is pertinent to mention here that investigating 
officer recorded first confessional statement of Adeel 
Ahmad co-accused on 28.02.2024 in line with the 
story of crime report. In that statement he (co-accused) 
has not stated that he purchased drone from petitioner 
but on the following day, i.e. 29.02.2024 his second 
confessional statement was recorded during the course 
of investigation wherein he simply stated that 

8 
Crl.Misc. No. 17244-B of 2024  
 
 
 
 
recovered drone was purchased from Lucky Electronic 
Hall Road, Lahore owned by the petitioner. In his 
second confessional statement Adeel Ahmad, co-
accused has not stated that Salman Hamid, petitioner 
was in the knowledge that he (co-accused) purchased 
drone from his shop for the purpose of supply of 
narcotics or the petitioner was in connived with him in 
the illegal business of narcotics.    
 
It would not be out of place to mention here that 
Article 18 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 fully safeguards the lawful business of 
the citizens, which for convenience is reproduced 
infra:-  
 
Article 18. Subject to such qualifications, if 
any, as may be prescribed by law, every 
citizen shall have the right to enter upon any 
lawful profession or occupation, and to 
conduct any lawful trade or business : 
Provided that nothing in this Article shall 
prevent– 
 
(a) the regulation of any trade or profession 
by a licensing system; or  
 
(b) the regulation of trade, commerce or 
industry in the interest of free competition 
therein; or 
 
(c) 
the 
carrying 
on, 
by 
the 
Federal 
Government or a Provincial Government, or 
by a corporation controlled by any such 
Government, of any trade, business, Freedom 
of assembly. Freedom of association. Freedom 
of trade, business or profession  industry or 
service, to the exclusion, complete or partial, 
of other persons. 
 

9 
Crl.Misc. No. 17244-B of 2024  
 
 
 
 
 
It has been ordained in Article 4 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 that 
every citizen of Pakistan shall be treated in accordance 
with law. Article 4 is hereby mentioned below:  
 
Article 4. (1) To enjoy the protection of law and to 
be treated in accordance with law is the inalienable 
right of every citizen, wherever he may be, and of 
every other person for the time being within 
Pakistan.  
(2) In particular–  
(a) no action detrimental to the life, liberty, body, 
reputation or property of any person shall be taken 
except in accordance with law;  
(b) no person shall be prevented from or be 
hindered in doing that which is not prohibited by 
law; and  
(c) no person shall be compelled to do that which 
the law does not require him to do.   
 
More-so, life and liberty of a person is protected 
in the light of Article 9 of the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 which is described below 
for the purpose of facilitation:- 
 
Article 9.  
No person shall be deprived of life or      
 
liberty save in accordance with law. 
 
In the light of above said circumstances, it is 
held that investigating officer of this case has travelled 
beyond his jurisdiction. He illegally arrested the 
petitioner and thereafter taken into possession drones 
from his shop without lawful authority. If this practice 
be allowed to continue, then not a single citizen of 
Pakistan can run any lawful business.  
 

10 
Crl.Misc. No. 17244-B of 2024  
 
 
 
 
10. 
Another crippling feature of this case which 
cannot be lost sight of is that it is nowhere mentioned 
in the prosecution’s case that the petitioner has some 
direct relation with the narcotic drugs or as otherwise 
dealt with. It is worth mentioning here that the 
evidence of an accomplice is ordinarily regarded as 
suspicion; therefore, extent and level of corroboration 
has to be assessed keeping in view the peculiar facts 
and surrounding circumstances of the case. The 
question whether the petitioner had the conscious 
knowledge that sold out drone to be used for the 
supply of narcotics to its customers by the co-accused 
Adeel Ahmad, shall be determined by the trial court 
after recording of evidence and at this stage 
applicability of section 15 of Control of Narcotics 
Substances Act, 1997 against the petitioner is doubtful 
in nature because no such evidence is available in this 
respect. Reliance in placed upon the following case 
law titled as “Atif ur Rehman vs. The State and 
another” (2021 SCMR 324) and “Gul Manan vs. The 
State” (2021 SCMR 1804).  
 
11. 
It is settled law that once accused succeeds to 
establish that his case calls for further inquiry and 
probe, then rigors contained in section 51 of the 
CNSA, 1997 would not be attracted. A reference in 
this respect may be made to the case laws reported as 
“Dad Khan vs. The State” (2020 SCMR 2062) and 
“Noman alias Noma vs. The State” (2020 P.Cr.L.J. 
Note 40). The petitioner is behind the bars since 

11 
Crl.Misc. No. 17244-B of 2024  
 
 
 
 
29.02.2024. The investigation of the case is complete 
and the petitioner is no more required by the police for 
the purpose of further investigation. The petitioner is 
still awaiting his trial, the conclusion of which is not in 
sight in near future, therefore, his further detention in 
jail would serve no useful purpose for the prosecution. 
Accordingly, this petition is allowed and the petitioner 
is admitted to post arrest bail on furnishing bail bond 
in the sum of Rs.5,00,000/- with one surety in the like 
amount to the satisfaction of the learned trial Court.  
 
12.  
Needless to mention here that the observations 
made hereinabove are only tentative in their nature and 
are strictly confined to the extent of grant of instant 
bail.
