The convict was ordered to be hanged by his neck till dead.  
 
Ismail son of Ghulam Haider and Muhammad Jalil son of Ghulam Haider, the co-
accused of the convict, were however acquitted by the learned trial court. Ghulam 
Haider, another co-accused of the convict, died during the trial and to his extent the 
proceedings were abated. 
2. 
 Feeling aggrieved, Muhammad Arif son of Ghulam Haider  (convict)   
lodged the Criminal appeal No.1150-J of 2019 through Jail, assailing his 
conviction and sentence. The learned trial court submitted Murder Reference 
No.135 of 2019 under section 374 Cr.P.C. seeking confirmation or otherwise of the 
sentence of death awarded to the appellant namely Muhammad Arif son of Ghulam 
Haider  (convict). The complainant of the case namely Ghulam Yaseen filed 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.130 of 2019 seeking permission to file an 
appeal against the acquittal of Ismail son of Ghulam Haider and Muhammad Jalil 
son of Ghulam Haider, the co-accused of the convict, both since acquitted. We 
intend to dispose of the Criminal Appeal No.1150-J of 2019, the Petition for 
Special Leave to Appeal No.130 of 2019 and the Murder Reference No.135 of 
2019 through this single judgment.

Precisely, the necessary facts of the prosecution case, as stated by Ghulam 
Yaseen (PW-5), the complainant of the case, are as under:- 
 
“ Talib Hussain deceased was my elder brother. On 15.07.2016, I 
alongwith Talib Hussain and Khalil Ahmad were grazing our sheep and 
goats near Canal known as Fazil Waha. While one Allah Ditta son of 
Mallik Hammad was working is nearby cotton field. Then we were taking 
rest and having gossips alongwith our cattle under a sheesham tree. At 
12:30 p.m. accused persons all of sudden accused persons namely Arif 
armed with pistol 30-bore, Jalil armed with pistol 30-bore, Ismail armed 
Sota and Ghulam Haider armed with Sota all present in court in their own 
motorcycle. Ghulam Haidar and Jalil accused present in court raised 
Lalkara with the words "be ready and you would not be spared today". 
Then Jalil accused made a fire at Khalil but luckily Khalil was saved. 
Then Ghluam Haider and Ismail accused started giving us fits blows while 
holding us due to fear Talib Hussain ran towards Kachha path, where 
Ghulam Haidar accused caught hold him and asked Muhammad Arif 
accused to fire at Talib Hussain after aiming at him. Then Talib Hussain 
fell down again said. Then Arif accused fired at Talib Hussain which hit 
him on right side of his mouth and exit through head. Then Talib Hussain 
fell down and tried to apprehend the accused persons on which all the 
accused persons threatened us that we will face the same consequences if 
came closer and due to fear we did not come close to them. We were 
empty handed. I left Allah Ditta and Khalil PWS with the deadbody and 
went to inform police about the occurrence. When police met me at 
Aqilpur where I got recorded my statement. Police also got affixed my 
thumb impressions on said statement. Police did not read over the 
statement thing. Then police declared accused Ismail innocent. Thanedar 
also recorded my statement against the facts as he wrongly mentioned the 
seat of injury in the statement recorded by him. I kept on moving 
applications on different forum but nobody attended me. Then I filed 
instant private complaint which is Ex.P.D. I also affixed my thumb 
impression on complaint witness is Ex.P.D/1. Motive behind the 
occurrence was the dispute on digging water course between Talib 
Hussain deceased and Ghulam Hussain accused one day prior to 
occurrence. All the accused persons in pursuance of common intention of 
all committed the instant occurrence.” 
 
4. 
The accused were summoned to face trial in the case instituted upon the 
private complaint titled “Ghulam Yaseen  Vs. Muhammad Arif  and three others” 
(relating to F.I.R. No. 220 of 2016 dated 15.07.2016 registered at Police Station 
Saddar Rajanpur, District Rajanpur) in respect of offences under sections 302  and

34 P.P.C. for committing the Qatl-i-Amd of  Talib Hussain son of Allah Yar 
(deceased). The learned trial court framed the charge against the accused on 
13.05.2017, to which the accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.   
 
5. 
The complainant of the case in order to prove its case got recorded 
statements of as many as eight witnesses. The ocular account of the case was 
furnished by Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) . Shah Daad Khan 
Patwari (PW-1) prepared the scaled site plan of the place of occurrence (Exh.PA). 
Shahid Hussain, T/ASI  (PW-2) stated that on 15.07.2016 he recorded the formal 
F.I.R  (Exh. PB/1).  Abdul Rashid 6/C (PW-3) stated that on 15.07.2016 he 
escorted the dead body of the deceased to the hospital and received the last worn 
clothes of the deceased from the Medical Officer after the post mortem 
examination of the dead body of the deceased.  Abdul Karim (PW-4) stated that on 
15.07.2016 he identified the dead body of the deceased at the time of post mortem 
examination and the Medical Officer handed over the last worn clothes of the 
deceased to the police official after post mortem examination. Allah Bakhsh Asim, 
ASI (PW-8) stated that on 15.07.2016, the Investigating Officer of the case handed 
over to him one sealed parcel said to contain blood stained earth and one sealed 
parcel said to contain empty shells of the bullets collected from the place of 
occurrence and on 25.08.2016, he handed over the said sealed parcels said to 
contain blood stained earth and empty shells of the bullets collected from the place 
of occurrence to Abid Aziz, ASI (CW-1) for their onward transmission to the 
office of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore. and on 22.08.2016, Abid 
Aziz, ASI (CW-1) handed over to him one sealed parcel said to contain a pistol 
and on 09.10.2016, he handed over the said sealed parcel said to contain a pistol to

Abid Aziz, ASI (CW-1) for its onward transmission to the office of the Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency, Lahore.  
 
6. 
The complainant also got Dr. Muhammad Adeel Khalid (PW-7) examined, 
who on 15.07.2016 was posted as Medical Officer at R.H.C. Makhdoom Rasheed 
and on the same day conducted the post-mortem examination of the dead body of 
the deceased, namely Talib Hussain son of Allah Yar. Dr. Muhammad Adeel 
Khalid (PW-7) on examining the dead body of the deceased namely Talib Hussain 
son of Allah Yar, observed as under:- 
“ There was fire arm entry wound 1.5 x 1 c.m, margins were burnt and 
inverted, situated on below right angle of mouth with exit wound of 2 x 2 
c.m, margins were everted situated on left side of parital bone of skull 
 
………………….. 
 
After thorough examination, in my opinion, injury No.1 was ante mortem 
and caused by fire arm weapon. The injury No.1 was sufficient to cause 
death due to brain haemorrhage and shock. The probable duration between 
injury and death was immediate and between death and postmortem it was 
5-6 hours probably.” 
 
7.     The learned trial court examined Abid Aziz, ASI (CW-1), the Investigating 
Officer of the case, as a Court witness who investigated the case from 15.07.2016 
till 11.10.2016, arrested the appellant namely Muhammad Arif son of Ghulam 
Haider on 14.08.2016 and detailed the facts of the investigation as conducted by 
him in his statement before the learned trial court.

8.    
On 18.10.2019, the learned counsel for the complainant gave up the 
witnesses namely Allah Ditta and Ahmad Yar as being unnecessary. On 
25.10.2019 , the complainant of the case tendered in evidence the reports of the 
Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PN and Exh. PO) and closed the 
prosecution evidence. 
 
9. 
After the closure of prosecution evidence, the learned trial court examined 
the appellant namely Muhammad Arif son of Ghulam Haider  (convict)   and under 
section 342 Cr.P.C. and in answer to the question why this case against you and 
why the P.W.s have deposed against you, he replied that he was innocent and had 
been falsely involved in the case. Muhammad Arif son of Ghulam Haider  
(convict)   further stated that he had not committed any offence and had been made 
a scapegoat in the case in order to show efficiency by the police. The appellant 
namely Muhammad Arif son of Ghulam Haider  opted not to get himself examined 
under section 340(2) Cr.P.C  and did not adduce any evidence in his defence. 
 
10. 
At the conclusion of the trial, the learned Sessions Judge, Rajanpur 
convicted and sentenced the appellant as referred to above.   
 
11.        The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant namely Muhammad 
Arif son of Ghulam precisely is that the whole case is fabricated and false and the 
prosecution remained unable to prove the facts in issue and did not produce any 
unimpeachable, admissible, and relevant evidence. Learned counsel for the 
appellant further contended that the story of the prosecution mentioned in the 
statements of the witnesses, on the face of it, was highly improbable. Learned

counsel for the appellant further contended that the statements of the prosecution 
witnesses were not worthy of any reliance. The learned counsel for the appellant 
also submitted that the recovery of the pistol (P-6) from the appellant namely 
Muhammad Arif son of Ghulam Haider was full of procedural defects, of no legal 
worth and value, and were result of fake proceedings. The learned counsel for the 
appellant also argued that the appellant had been involved in the occurrence only 
on suspicion. The learned counsel for the appellant finally submitted that the 
prosecution had totally failed to prove the case against the accused beyond the 
shadow of a doubt.   
11. 
On the other hand, the learned Additional Prosecutor General  along with the 
learned counsel for the complainant, contended that the prosecution had proved its 
case beyond the shadow of doubt by producing independent witnesses. The learned 
Additional Prosecutor General along with the learned counsel for the complainant, 
further argued that the deceased died as a result of injuries suffered at the hands of 
the appellant. The learned Additional Prosecutor General along with the learned 
counsel for the complainant, further contended that the medical evidence also 
corroborated the statements of the eye witnesses. The learned Additional 
Prosecutor General along with the learned counsel for the complainant, further 
contended that the recovery of the pistol (P-6) from the appellant namely 
Muhammad Arif son of Ghulam Haider  also corroborated the ocular account. The 
learned Additional Prosecutor General along with the learned counsel for the 
complainant, further stated that there was no occasion for the prosecution 
witnesses, who were related to the deceased, to substitute the real offender with the 
innocent in this case. Lastly, the learned Additional Prosecutor General along with

the learned counsel for the complainant prayed for the rejection of the appeal as 
lodged by the appellant namely Muhammad Arif son of Ghulam Haider. The 
learned counsel for the complainant also argued that the Petition for Special Leave 
to Appeal No.130 of 2019, assailing the acquittal of Ismail son of Ghulam Haider 
and Muhammad Jalil son of Ghulam Haider by the learned trial court from the 
charges also merited acceptance. 
12. 
We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant, the learned counsel for 
the complainant, the learned Additional Prosecutor General and with their 
assistance carefully perused the record and evidence recorded during the trial. 
13.     A perusal of the prosecution evidence reveals that the whole prosecution 
case as against the appellant namely Muhammad Arif son of Ghulam Haider is 
based on the statements of the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-
5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6). The relationship of the prosecution witnesses 
namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) with the deceased is on 
record. Talib Hussain (deceased) was the brother of the prosecution witness 
namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and the prosecution witness namely Khalil Ahmad 
(PW-6). The prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil 
Ahmed (PW-6) were also admittedly not the residents of the place of occurrence. 
According to the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil 
Ahmed (PW-6) both of them had their residence at a distance of about as much as 
3-4 squares from the place of occurrence. The prosecution witness namely Ghulam 
Yaseen (PW-5) , during cross-examination stated as under:- 
“ Talib Hussain deceased was my real brother. PW Khalil is my real 
brother. 
…….

Criminal Appeal    No. 1150-J of 2019 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.130 of 2019

The distance between place of occurrence is about 3 square of land from 
my house ” (emphasis supplied)  
Similarly, the prosecution witness namely Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) during cross-
examination, stated as under:- 
“ Talib Hussain deceased was my real brother. PW Ghulam Yasin is my 
real brother.  
…… 
 The distance between place of occurrence is about 3 square of land from 
my house.” 
In this manner, the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and 
Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) can be validly termed as “chance witnesses” and therefore 
were under a bounden duty to provide a convincing reason for their presence at the 
place of occurrence, at the time of occurrence and were also under a duty to prove 
their presence by producing some physical proof of the same. We have noted with 
grave concern that the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and 
Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) failed miserably to provide any consistent evidence as to the 
reason for their arrival at the place of occurrence and their presence at the place of 
occurrence when the same was taking place. The prosecution witness namely 
Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5)  had claimed that they were present at the place of 
occurrence, prior to the arrival of the accused at the said place as they were 
engaged in grazing their sheep and goats, near Fazil Wah Canal, whereas the 
prosecution witness namely Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) stated that they were present at 
the place of occurrence, prior to the arrival of the accused at the said place as they 
were engaged in grazing their cattle. The prosecution witness namely Ghulam 
Yaseen (PW-5), in his statement before the learned trial court got recorded as 
under:- 

Murder Reference No.135 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 1150-J of 2019 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.130 of 2019 
 
10 
 
“ Talib Hussain deceased was my elder brother. On 15.07.2016, I alongwith 
Talib Hussain and Khalil Ahmad were grazing our sheep and goats near Canal 
known as Fazil Waha” (emphasis supplied)  
Contradicting the prosecution witness namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) regarding 
the purpose of their presence at the place of occurrence, prior to the occurrence, the 
prosecution witness namely Khalil Ahmad (PW-6), in his statement before the 
learned trial court got recorded as under:- 
“On 15.07.2016 we were grazing our cattle near the canal under the sheesham 
tree when accused persons namely Muhammad Arif, Muhammad Jalil, Ismail and 
Ghulam Haider suddenly came there ” (emphasis supplied)  
Obviously, there is a huge difference between cattle, sheep and goats. The 
prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) 
could not even make a consistent statement as to the reason for their presence at 
the place of occurrence, denuding the fact that both of them were not present at the 
place of occurrence and therefore such a huge contradiction cropped up in their 
statements regarding their reason for the presence at the place of the occurrence. 
Moreover,  Abid Aziz ASI (CW-1), the Investigating Officer of the case , at the 
time of his visit to the place of occurrence, did not take into possession any 
physical proof of the claim of the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen 
(PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) that they were present at the place of 
occurrence grazing sheep, cattle or goats. Abid Aziz ASI (CW-1), the Investigating 
Officer of the case during cross-examination admitted that at the time of his visit to 
the place of occurrence neither he saw any sheep nor goats nor any cattle present 
there and furthermore he did not even observe the presence of any hoof marks of 
such animals present at or around the place of occurrence. Abid Aziz ASI (CW-1), 

Murder Reference No.135 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 1150-J of 2019 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.130 of 2019 
 
11 
 
the Investigating Officer of the case further admitted during cross-examination that 
the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-
6) also did not point out the presence of such cattle, sheep or goats to him at the 
time of his visit to the place of occurrence. Abid Aziz ASI (CW-1), the 
Investigating Officer of the case during cross-examination, admitted as under:- 
“ I reached at the place of occurrence after about half an hour of the recording of 
statement of complainant Ex.P-B. When I reached at the place of occurrence 
there were no goats or sheep. Complainant or PWs did not point out me 
about the presence of herd of goats or sheep. It was Kacha place at the place of 
occurrence. I have not mentioned the signs of scuffling or foot prints of the 
herd because the same were not available”(emphasis supplied)  
Abid Aziz, ASI (CW-1), the Investigating Officer of the case, admitted during 
cross-examination that the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) 
and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6)  never produced before him the animals for the care of 
which prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed 
(PW-6)  were available at the place of occurrence. The non-production and the 
non-availability of the animals for the care of which the prosecution witnesses 
namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) had arrived at the place 
of occurrence and the failure of the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen 
(PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) to produce the same before the Investigating 
Officer of the case, leads to only one conclusion and that being that no such 
animals were being taken care of by the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam 
Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) while they grazed. Had such animals 
been present at the place of occurrence, then the same must have been available at 
the place of occurrence, at the time of arrival of Abid Aziz ASI (CW-1), the 

Murder Reference No.135 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 1150-J of 2019

Investigating Officer of the case and the same would necessarily have been taken 
into possession by Abid Aziz ASI (CW-1), the Investigating Officer of the case or 
at least their presence marked in the inspection note as well as in the rough site 
plan of the place of occurrence (Exh. PM) but they were not . Furthermore , Abid 
Aziz ASI (CW-1), the Investigating Officer of the case would have prepared a 
memo marking the presence of such animals at the place of occurrence had they 
being there but he did not and it proves that a false claim was made by the 
prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) 
that the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed 
(PW-6) were present at the place of occurrence while taking care of animals owned 
by them. In this manner, the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) 
and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) failed miserably to prove that they had indeed arrived at 
the place of occurrence, before the occurrence. Reliance in this regard is placed on 
the case of “Muhammad Ali Vs. The State” (2015 SCMR 137). The proven failure 
of the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed 
(PW-6)  to provide a reason for their presence at the place of occurrence, on the 
day of the incident, has repercussions, proving that there was no reason actually for 
the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-
6)  to be visiting the place of occurrence. The very inception of the prosecution 
case is thus put in doubt due to the said abject failure of the prosecution witnesses 
namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6).  The failure of the 
prosecution to prove their claims regarding the reason for their presence at the 
place of occurrence has vitiated our trust in Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil 
Ahmed (PW-6)  as being truthful witnesses. In this respect, reliance is placed on 
the case of “Muhammad Rafiq v. State” (2014 SCMR 1698) wherein the august 

Murder Reference No.135 of 2019

Supreme Court of Pakistan rejected the claim of witnesses who lived one kilometre 
away from the place of occurrence, but on the day of occurrence stated to be 
present near the spot as they were working as labourers, inasmuch as they failed to 
give any detail of the projects they were working on. Reliance is also placed on the 
case of “Usman alias Kaloo v. State” (2017 SCMR 622) wherein the august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan held that the ocular account of the incident had been 
furnished by Zahoor Ahmad, Ghulam Farid and Manzoor Ahmed in the said case 
who were all residents of some other houses and they were not the inmates of the 
house wherein the occurrence had taken place and therefore the said eye-witnesses 
were, thus, declared chance witnesses and not worthy of reliance. Reliance is also 
placed on the case of “Nasrullah alias Nasro v. The State” (2017 SCMR 724). 
14. 
We have also noted another flaw in the statements of the prosecution 
witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) which 
proves that no reliance can be  placed upon their statements. Both the prosecution 
witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) claimed that 
during the occurrence they were beaten by the accused, as many as four in total, 
however, also admitted that neither they were examined by any Medical Officer 
nor any Medico Legal Examination Certificate existed with regard to them nor 
Abid Aziz ASI (CW-1), the Investigating Officer of the case even prepared any 
injury statement mentioning the presence of injuries on the bodies of prosecution 
witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) as allegedly 
inflicted upon them by the accused. The prosecution witness namely Ghulam 
Yaseen (PW-5) in his statement recorded by the learned trial, court  stated as 
under:-

“ Then Ghluam Haider and Ismail accused started giving us fits (sic)  
blows while holding us 
……… 
 The accused were having Sotas in their hand when they were causing fist 
blows to us. Again said, at the time when they gave fist blows to us, the 
Sotas had fallen on the ground.” 
The prosecution witness namely Khalil Ahmad (PW-6)  in his statement recorded 
by the learned trial court , stated as under:- 
“ Ghulam Haider and Ismail accused kept on giving us fits blows 
…….. 
I had recorded before the 1.0. that Ghulam Haider and Ismail accused 
persons  gave us fist blows. (Confronted with Ex.D.A. wherein it is not so 
recorded).” 
We have also noted that the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) 
and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) also failed to explain the presence of the motorcycle (P-
7), which was found present at the place of occurrence by Abid Aziz ASI (CW-1), 
the Investigating Officer of the case and was also taken into possession by him. 
The prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed 
(PW-6) in their statements did not even state that the accused had arrived on the 
motorcycle (P-7) at the place of occurrence or that they had fled away from the 
place of occurrence leaving behind the said motorcycle. Even Abid Aziz ASI (CW-
1), the Investigating Officer of the case admitted during cross-examination that the 
prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) 
could not explain the presence of the motorcycle (P-7) at the place of occurrence 

Murder Reference No.135 of 2019

15 
 
and the damaged condition of the said motorcycle (P-7). Abid Aziz ASI (CW-1), 
the Investigating Officer of the case, during cross-examination, admitted as under:- 
“ I took into, possession the motorcycle P7 from the place of occurrence, said to 
be belonging to accused persons. I did not inquire from the complainant and PWs 
about the damage condition of motorcycle (P-7). PWs also did not tell me about 
the said condition of the motorcycle, I have not written the reasons of damage 
condition of motorcycle P7 in my whole investigation, because I do not find any 
evidence in this regard” 
We have also noted that the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) 
and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) also failed to explain to the Investigating Officer of the 
case regarding the presence of the dead body of the deceased on a cot at the place 
of occurrence, whereas the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) 
and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) had claimed that the deceased had fallen on the ground 
and his body not shifted from that place. The prosecution witness namely Ghulam 
Yaseen (PW-5) during cross-examination, admitted as under:- 
“At the time when the IO. visited  the place of occurrence for the first time, the 
deadbody was lying on the ground. ” 
The prosecution witness namely Khalil Ahmad (PW-6) during cross-examination, 
admitted as under:- 
“ The 10. had captured photos of the deadbody when it was lying on cot. The 1.0. 
secured the bloodstained at the place where Talib Hussain deceased received 
injuries and died. The cot was at that place of occurrence. The cot was lying on 
different place from the place where the deceased received injuries.

The 1.O. had taken possession of that bloodstained soil where Talib Hussain was 
murdered and he had not taken bloodstained soil underneath the cot whereupon 
the deadbody was lying” (emphasis supplied)  
Abid Aziz ASI (CW-1), the Investigating Officer of the case , during cross-
examination, explained as under:- 
“ When I reached at the place of occurrence the deadbody was lying on a cot at 
another place and not on the point No.1 of unscaled site plan Ex.P-M. The 
deadbody was lying. on a cot at a distance of about 20 Krams from the point 
No.1. The blood was present under the cot upon which the deadbody was lying 
……….. 
The snaps of the deadbody which I prepared on my first visit of the place of 
occurrence are of the deadbody while lying on the cot at the place where the cot 
was lying. 
……… 
I inquired from the complainant and PWs that why they have and who 
shifted the deadbody from the place of occurrence but nobody replied to me 
and I warned them that they should have not shift the deadbody. I have not 
mentioned any tree near the point No.1 of unsealed site plan Ex.P-M because it 
was not present near the point No.1” (emphasis supplied)  
The above referred portions of the statements of the prosecution witnesses namely 
Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) and Abid Aziz ASI (CW-1), 
the Investigating Officer of the case bring out the contrast and contradictions in 
their statements and prove that the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen 
(PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) were not present at the place of occurrence and

therefore made the errors which they did and also could not explain many aspects 
related to the details of the occurrence and the crime scene.  
15. 
Another aspect drawing our grave concern is the fact that the prosecution 
witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) made blatant 
improvements to their previous statements in order to bring the ocular account as 
narrated by them, in line with the opinion and observations of Dr. Muhammad 
Adeel Khalid (PW-7), who had conducted the post mortem examination of the 
dead body and went on to claim that the injury mentioned by them as the entry 
wound in their previous statements was actually the exit wound and mentioned the 
seat of the entry wound on the dead body of the deceased  in their statements 
recorded by the learned trial court , which wound they had not earlier mentioned in 
their statements. The prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and 
Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) made a deliberate and dishonest departure from their earlier 
narrations of the occurrence while deposing before the learned trial court. The 
prosecution witness namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) was cross-examined in this 
regard and the learned trial court observed as under:- 
“I had made statement before the 1.0. that then Arif accused fired at Talib 
Hussain, which hit him on right side of his mouth and exit through head 
(Confronted with Ex.P.B. wherein it is not so recorded).” (emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Khalil Ahmad (PW-6) was also cross-examined in 
this regard and the learned trial court observed as under:- 
“I got recorded before the I.O. that the fire shot hit Talib Hussain deceased at his 
mouth and exit from head. (Confronted with Ex.D.A. wherein it is not so 
recorded).”

Abid Aziz ASI (CW-1), the Investigating Officer of the case admitted during 
cross-examination the blatant and dishonest improvement made by the prosecution 
witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) in their 
previous statements so as to bring them in conformity with the evidence and 
observations of Dr. Muhammad Adeel Khalid (PW-7) and stated as under:- 
“I have mentioned one injury through and through on the head of deadbody of 
Talib Hussain deceased on the injury statement Ex.PL/1 and inquest report Ex P-
L. The complainant got recorded in his statement Ex.P-B about one injury on the 
head of deceased. The complainant got recorded about the through and through 
injury but not specify the location about exit. The eye witnesses also had not 
disclosed in their statements u/s 161 Cr.P.C about the location of exit injury. They 
got recorded the injury on head as entry wound ” (emphasis supplied)  
By improving their previous statements , the prosecution witnesses namely 
Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6)   impeached their own credit. 
Article 151 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984 provides as under: - 
“151. Impeaching credit of witness. The credit of a witness may be 
impeached in the following ways by the adverse party, or, with the consent 
of the Court, by the party who calls him: 
(1) by the evidence of persons who testify that they, from their knowledge 
of the witness, believe him to be un worthy of credit; 
(2) by proof that the witness has been bribed, or has accepted the offer of a 
bribe, or has received any other corrupt inducement to give his evidence; 
(3) by proof of former statements inconsistent with any part of his 
evidence which is liable to be contradicted ;” 
As the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed 
(PW-6)  introduced dishonest, blatant and substantial improvements to their 

Murder Reference No.135 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 1150-J of 2019 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.130 of 2019 
 
19 
 
previous statements and were duly confronted with their former statements, hence 
their credit stands impeached and the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam 
Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) cannot be relied upon on, being proved 
to have deposed with a slight, intended to mislead the court. The august Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in the case of “Muhammad Ashraf Vs. State” (2012 SCMR 419) 
took serious notice of the improvements introduced by witnesses and rejected their 
evidence. We, thus, are satisfied that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses 
namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) has no intrinsic worth 
and is to be rejected outrightly. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in a recent 
case reported as “Muhammad Mansha Vs. The State” (2018 SCMR 772) has 
enunciated the following principle: 
 “Once the Court comes to the conclusion that the eye witnesses had made 
dishonest improvements in their statements then it is not safe to place 
reliance on their statements. It is also settled by this Court that whenever a 
witness made dishonest improvement in his version in order to bring his 
case in line with the medical evidence or in order to strengthen the 
prosecution case then his testimony is not worthy of credence”. 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case reported as Muhammad Arif Vs. 
The State (2019 SCMR 631) has enunciated the following principle: 
 “It is well established by now that when a witness improves his statement 
and moment it is observed that the said improvement was made dishonestly 
to strengthen the prosecution, such portion of his statement is to be 
discarded out of consideration. Having observed the improvements in the 
statements of both the witnesses of ocular account, we hold that it is not safe 
to rely on their testimony to maintain conviction and sentence of 
Muhammad Arif (appellant) on a capital charge.”  
Guidance is sought from the principle enunciated by the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the case of “Amin Ali and another Vs. The State” (2011 SCMR 323) 
where the august Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased to reject the evidence of 
injured witnesses and held as under:-  

Murder Reference No.135 of 2019

“11. All the three witnesses deposed that the deceased had received three 
injuries, but the Medical Officer found six injuries on the person of the 
deceased. One of them had blackening. None of the witnesses deposed that 
any of the appellants had caused the injuries from a close range but on the 
contrary in the site plan the place of firing has been shown 8 feet away from 
the deceased. Thus from such a distance injury with blackening cannot be 
caused as it can be caused from a distance of less than 3 feet as per Modi's 
Medical Jurisprudence. The Medical Officer did not show as to which of the 
injury was entry or exit wound on the person of the deceased. The medical 
officer stated that metalic projectile was recovered from wound No.1/B which 
was an exit wound. If it was an exit wound then the metalic projectile would 
have been out of the body. The presence of metalic projectile in the body 
clearly establishes the fact that it is not an exit wound but an entry wound. 
The medical officer has not shown that any of the injuries had inverted or 
averted margins so as to ascertain as to which of the injuries is entry or exit 
wound. Thus on this count there is a conflict between the medical and oral 
evidence. Furthermore, according to Medical Officer, the P.W.15 had four 
injuries out of them two were entry and two were exit wounds but the P.Ws. 
13 and 14 deposed that the injured had received three injuries. Thus the 
P.Ws. have shown one exit wound as entry wound. With regard to the injured 
Tanveer Hussain, the Medical Officer showed two injuries one entry wound 
on the chest and one exit wound on the back but all the three eye-witnesses 
deposed that P.W.14 had received two injuries on his chest. As regards 
injuries on the person of Mst. Maqbool Bibi. The Medical Officer found one 
entry wound on her back with blackening, whereas P.Ws. 13, 14 and 15 
deposed that the fire shot was fired from the roof of the shop. Entry wound 
with blackening marks cannot be caused from such a long distance. From the 
above position it is manifest that the ocular testimony is in conflict with the 
medical evidence. Thus, the deceased and injured did not receive the injuries 
in the manner, as alleged by the prosecution. 
………………………………. 
13. From the above evidence of the P. Ws., they do not appear to be truthful 
witnesses; therefore, no implicit reliance can be placed on their evidence.” 
 
16. 
     We have also noted that the stance set up by the prosecution in the 
present case was that the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) 
and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) were present at the time of the death of the deceased 
and had remained with the dead body however in the inquest report (Exh.PL), in 
column No.8  it had been noted that both the mouth and the eyes of the deceased 
were open at the time of preparation of the same, which clearly shows that the dead 
body was not attended to by the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen 
(PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6),  as claimed. The mouth and eyes of the 

Murder Reference No.135 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 1150-J of 2019 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.130 of 2019 
 
21 
 
deceased were found open at the time of preparation of the inquest report 
(Exh.PL), thus, if the witnesses were present then, at least after the death, as is a 
consistent practice of such close relatives, they would have closed the eyes and 
mouth of the deceased on his expiry, however, they did not. Thus, the open eyes 
and mouth of the deceased force a hostile interpretation against the prosecution's 
version regarding the presence of the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam 
Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) at the place of occurrence, at the time of 
occurrence. This fact by itself indicates that none was present with the deceased till 
his death. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “MUHAMMAD 
RAFIQUE alias FEEQA vs. The State”(2019 SCMR 1068) has held as under: 
“What has further irked this Court is that in column No. 9 of the Marg 
Report (Ex.PW9/1), and even in the Post Mortem Report (Ex.PW-10/A), 
the mouth of the deceased has been stated to be open, which clearly 
indicates that the dead body was not attended to by his close relatives 
after being pronounced dead. However, the stance set up by the 
prosecution in the present case is that Arshad Ali - the brother, and Nazir 
Ahmad - the uncle of the deceased Muhammad Azam were present at the 
time of his death, and remained with him, even thereafter. Thus, the said 
posture of the deceased raises an adverse inference against the 
prosecution's version regarding the presence of the said persons at the 
place and time of occurrence.” 
We have also noted that both the  prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen 
(PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6)  were  not mentioned either in  column No.4 of 
the inquest report (Exh.PL) as being the witnesses who had identified the dead 
body of the deceased at the time of preparation of the inquest report (Exh.PL)  nor 
were mentioned at page 4 of the inquest report (Exh.PL) as witnesses who were 
present at the place of occurrence at the time of preparation of the inquest report 
(Exh.PL). This fact also points towards the absence of the prosecution witnesses

namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) at the place of 
occurrence, at the time of preparation of the inquest report (Exh.PL) by Abid Aziz 
ASI (CW-1), the Investigating Officer of the case. 
17. 
      We have also observed that Dr. Muhammad Adeel Khalid (PW-7) opined 
that at the time of the postmortem examination of the dead body of the deceased, 
rigor mortis was developed. Before proceeding any further, it would be 
advantageous to mention here that rigor mortis is a term which stands for the 
stiffness of voluntary and involuntary muscles in human body after death. It starts 
within 2 to 4 hours of death and fully develops in about 12-hours in temperate 
climate. Similarly, the reverse process with which rigor mortis disappears is called 
algor mortis. In support of duration required to develop rigor mortis, an extract 
from “The Principles And Practice Of Medical Jurisprudence” by  Alfred Swaine 
Taylor,MD , is being referred hereunder:-  
"In sudden natural deaths occurring in a temperate climate during 
average seasonal conditions rigor mortis usually commences within 2 to 4 
hours of death. It reaches a peak in about 12 hours and starts to disappear 
after another 12 hours. The cadaver becoming limp some 36 hours after 
death."  
Likewise, Dr. S. Siddiq Husain in Chapter-V of his book "Forensic Medicine and 
Toxicology”, observed that in temperate climate the rigor mortis completes in 8 to 
12 hours. Similarly, William Carroll in his research article titled as "An 
Examination of Muscle Function", has declared a similar duration for rigor mortis 
to develop. In Chapter 15 ‘POST-MORTEM CHANGES AND TIME SINCE 
DEATH”, from page 351 to page 352 of Rai Bahadur Jaising P. Modi's A Textbook 

Murder Reference No.135 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 1150-J of 2019 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.130 of 2019

of Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology (26th  Edition 2018) ,it has been 
discoursed as under:-:  
"Rigor mortis generally occurs, while the body is cooling. It is in no 
way connected with the nervous system, and it develops even in 
paralyzed limbs, provided the paralyzed muscle tissues have not 
suffered much in nutrition. It is retarded by perfusion with normal 
saline.  
Owing to the setting in of rigor mortis all the muscles of the body 
become stiff, hard, opaque and contracted, but they do not alter the 
position of body or limb. A joint rendered stiff and rigid after death, if 
flexed forcibly by mechanical violence, will remain supple and 
flaccid, but will not return to its original position after the force is 
withdrawn; whereas a joint contracted during life in cases of hysteria 
or catalepsy will return to the same condition after the force is taken 
away.  
Rigor mortis first appears in the involuntary muscles, and then in the 
voluntary. In the heart it appears, as a rule, within an hour after death, 
and may be mistaken for hypertrophy, and its relaxation or dilatation, 
atrophy or degeneration. The left chambers are affected more than the 
right. Post-mortem delivery may occur owing to contraction of the 
uterine muscular fibres.  
In the voluntary muscles rigor mortis follows a definite course. It first 
occurs in the muscles of the eyelids, next in the muscles of the back of 
the neck and lower jaw, then in those of the front of the neck, face, 
chest and upper extremities, and lastly extends downwards to the 
muscles of the abdomen and lower extremities. Last to be affected are 
the small muscles of the fingers and toes. It passes off in the same 
sequence. However, according to H.A. Shapiro this progress of rigor 
mortis from proximal to distal areas is apparent only, it actually starts 
in all muscles simultaneously but one can distinguish the early 
developing and fully established stage, which gives an indication of 
the time factor.  
Time of Onset.- This varies greatly in different cases, but the average 
period of its onset may be regarded as three to six hours after death in 
temperate climates, and it may take two to three hours to develop. 
Duration-In temperate regions, rigor mortis usually lasts for two to 
three days. In northern India, the usual duration of rigor morts is 24 10 
48 hours in winter and 18 to 36 hours in summer. According to the 
investigations of Mackenzie, in Calcutta, the average duration is 
nineteen hours and twelve minutes, the shortest period being three 
hours, and the the longest forty hours." In Colombo, the average 
duration is 12 to 18 hours. When rigor mortis sets in early, it passes

24 
 
off quickly and vice versa. In general, rigor mortis sets in one to two 
hours after death, is well developed from head to foot in about twelve 
hours. Whether rigor is in the developing phase, established phase, or 
maintained phase is decided by associated findings like marbling, 
right lower abdominal discolouration, tense or taut state of the 
abdomen, disappearance of rigor on face and eye muscles. If on 
examination, the body is stiff, the head cannot be fixed towards the 
chest, then in all probability, the death might have occurred six to 
twelve hours or so more before the time of examination.” 
 
The occurrence statedly took place at about 12.30 p.m. on 15.07.2016 whereas Dr. 
Muhammad Adeel Khalid (PW-7) conducted the post mortem examination of the 
dead body  of the deceased on 15.07.2016 at 5:30 p.m . Dr. Muhammad Adeel 
Khalid (PW-7), in his statement before the learned trial court , stated as under:- 
“A deadbody of about 49 years old man lying on autopsy table wearing Qameez 
of light sky blue and Dhoti. Rigor mortis developed while postmortem staining 
fully developed” (emphasis supplied)  
The development of rigor mortis and the post-mortem staining on the dead body 
fully developed in the month of July,  at the time of post mortem examination of 
dead body, contradicts the  time of occurrence deposed by the prosecution 
witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) .In the month 
of July, development of rigor mortis and the presence of post mortem staining 
completed on the dead body within such a short span of time as suggested by the 
prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) 
was implausible and the occurrence does not appear to have taken place at the 
point of time mentioned by the witnesses. The August Supreme Court of Pakistan 
in the case of “Noor Ahmad vs. The State and others ”(2019 SCMR 1327) has held 
as under: 

Murder Reference No.135 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 1150-J of 2019 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.130 of 2019 
 
25 
 
“Occurrence statedly took place at 10.00 a.m. whereas the autopsy was 
conducted at 5.00 p.m. development of complete rigor mortis on the body of 
a young lady in hot weather, belies point of time of assault given in the 
crime report”. 
The August Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Asad Rehmat vs. The State 
and others ”(2019 SCMR 1156) has held as under: 
“Occurrence, statedly, took place at 2.00 p.m., autopsies started 4.30 p.m., 
concluded at 9.00 p.m. Muhammad Hayat was examined first; the medical 
officer noted rigor mortis. Same is the case with other corpses. In the 
month of March, development of rigor mortis within such short span of 
time is mind boggling; occurrence does not appear to have taken place at 
the point of time mentioned in the crime report.” 
 
For the abovementioned observations of Dr. Muhammad Adeel Khalid (PW-7), we 
are swayed to hold that time of occurrence as deposed by the prosecution witnesses 
namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) is not free from 
uncertainty, proving their absence.   
18.     The learned Additional Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the 
complainant placed much emphasis on the promptitude with which the oral 
statement (Exh. PB) of Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5)  was recorded by Abid Aziz ASI 
(CW-1), the Investigating Officer of the case and stated that this excluded the 
possibility of any pre-concert prior to the recording of the oral statement (Exh. 
PB). The prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed 
(PW-6) themselves admitted that the oral statement (Exh.PB) was wrongly 
recorded and themselves abandoned the said oral statement (Exh.PB). The 
prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) 
during cross-examination repeatedly stated that the oral statement (Exh.PB) was 
not recorded correctly and the details of the occurrence as mentioned in the said 

Murder Reference No.135 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 1150-J of 2019 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.130 of 2019 
 
26 
 
oral statement (Exh.PB) were not correct. The prosecution witness namely Ghulam 
Yaseen (PW-5) , admitted during cross-examination, as under:- 
“ The I.O. recorded my first statement u/s 154 Cr.P.C. wrongly 
……… 
At the time of bail petitions, I and my counsel did not take any stance that the 
police did not record my statement correctly. Volunteer that on the receipt of copy 
of postmortem report, I came to know that my statement was incorrectly recorded 
After showing postmortem report to my counsel, I came to know that my 
statement was incorrectly recorded by the police. When I produced copy of my 
postmortem report to my counsel, then I came to know that the seat of injury was 
not according to seat of injury mentioned in the FIR. After knowing about this 
fact, I moved applications for change of investigation 1 ½ months thereafter. I 
filed the instant private complaint 1 ½ years after my moving those applications” 
(emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Khalil Ahmad (PW-6), admitted during cross-
examination , as under:- 
“During investigation our case could not be proved, therefore, we have filed 
the private complaint regarding the occurrence. 1 ½  months after the occurrence, 
when we showed postmortem report to our counsel, we came to know that the 
police did not lodge FIR correctly ” (emphasis supplied)  
 Moreover, we have noted that despite the disapproval of the August Supreme 
Court of Pakistan, the same method was adopted in this case; that the recording of 
the oral statement (Exh. PB) was shown when the complainant namely Ghulam 
Yaseen (PW-5)   was allegedly on his way to the Police Station to report the matter, 
however, suddenly came across Abid Aziz ASI (CW-1), the Investigating Officer of 

Murder Reference No.135 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 1150-J of 2019 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.130 of 2019 
 
27 
 
the case. The August Supreme Court of Pakistan has termed this practice as 
misleading and deceptive. The August Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of 
Mst. Rukhsana Begum & others v. Sajjad & others (2017 SCMR 596) observed at 
page 601 as under: 
“In the ridder to the FIR, the Investigating Officer has mentioned that the 
complainant Muhammad Faazal met him somewhere in the way while 
proceeding to the police station. In past, it had become routine practice of 
the police that indeed in such like crimes, the FIR/written complaints were 
being taken on the crime spot after preliminary investigation, however, 
after this court had disapproved this practice, they have invented a new 
way of misleading the court of law because invariably in every second or 
third case, same and similar practice is adopted.” 
Reliance is also placed on the case of Abdul Jabbar alias Jabbari v. The State 
(2017 SCMR 1155) wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan observed as 
under: 
“An FIR in respect of the incident in issue had not been lodged at the local Police 
Station giving rise to an inference that the FIR had been chalked out after 
deliberations and preliminary investigation at the spot.” 
 
The scrutiny of the statements of the prosecution witnesses reveals that the oral 
statement (Exh.P.B) of Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) was neither prompt nor 
spontaneous nor natural, rather was a contrived, manufactured and a compromised 
document. No corroboration of the prosecution evidence can be had from the said 
oral statement (Exh. PA) of Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) Sufficient doubts have arisen 
and inference against the prosecution has to be drawn in this regard. 
 
19. 
 The learned Additional Prosecutor General and the learned counsels for the 
complainant, have submitted that the recovery of the pistol (P-6) from the appellant 
namely Muhammad Arif son of Ghulam Haider offered sufficient corroboration of 
the statements of the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and 
Khalil Ahmed (PW-6). Regarding the recovery of the pistol (P-6) from the 

Murder Reference No.135 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 1150-J of 2019 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.130 of 2019 
 
28 
 
appellant namely Muhammad Arif son of Ghulam Haider, the same cannot be 
relied upon as the Investigating Officer of the case, did not join any witness of the 
locality during the recovery of the pistol (P-6) from the appellant namely 
Muhammad Arif son of Ghulam Haider  which was in clear violation of section 
103 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. The provisions of section 103 Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1898, unfortunately, are honoured more in disuse than 
compliance. To appreciate it better, this section is being reproduced:- 
"103.--(1) Before making a search under this chapter, the officer or other 
person about to make it shall call upon two or more respectable 
inhabitants of the locality in which the place to be searched is situate 
to attend and witness the search and may issue an order in writing to 
them or any of them so to do.” 
 
Therefore, the evidence of the recovery of the pistol (P-6) from the appellant 
namely Muhammad Arif son of Ghulam Haider cannot be used as incriminating 
evidence against the appellant, being evidence that was obtained through illegal 
means and hence hit by the exclusionary rule of evidence The august Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in the case of Muhammad Ismail and others Vs. The State ( 2017 
SCMR 898) at page 901 has held as under:- 
“For the above mentioned recovery of weapons the prosecution had failed to 
associate any independent witness of the locality and, thus, the mandatory 
provisions of section 103, Cr.P.C. had flagrantly been violated in that regard.”  
 
We have also noted that the appellant namely Muhammad Arif son of Ghulam 
Haider was arrested on 14.08.2016, the pistol (P-6) was recovered from the 
appellant namely Muhammad Arif son of Ghulam Haider on 22.08.2016,  however 
the empty shells of the bullets taken into possession from the place of occurrence 
on 15.07.2016 were sent to Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore on 
26.08.2016 though there was no reason for keeping the shells of the bullets, which

were taken into possession of on the day of occurrence,  at the Police Station and 
not sending them to the office of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore till 
26.08.2016 i.e. after the appellant had been arrested on 14.08.2016. In this manner 
the report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore. (Exh. PN) regarding the 
comparison of the shells of the bullets taken from the place of occurrence with the 
pistol (P-6) recovered from the appellant,  has no evidentiary value as the 
possibility of fabrication is apparent. Reliance is placed on the case of Muhammad 
Amin Vs. The State and another (2019 S C M R 2057) wherein the august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan has held as under:- 
“Interestingly, two empty cartridges (P-4/1-2) were secured from the place of 
occurrence by the investigating officer Akhtar Ali, SI (PW12) on the night of 
11.10.2012, but the same were sent to the office of Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency on 23.01.2013 i.e. after arrest of the appellant in this case. In these 
circumstances, the positive report of FSL is of no avail to the prosecution and 
is inconsequential.” 
 In view of the above-mentioned facts, the alleged recovery of the pistol (P-6)   
from the appellant namely Muhammad Arif son of Ghulam Haider is  not proved 
and the same cannot be used as a circumstance against the appellant. Even 
otherwise, as we have disbelieved the ocular account in this case, hence, the 
evidence of the recovery of the pistol (P-6)  from the appellant namely Muhammad 
Arif son of Ghulam Haider would have no consequence. It is an admitted rule of 
appreciation of evidence that recovery is only a supporting piece of evidence and if 
the ocular account is found to be unreliable, then the recovery has no evidentiary 
value. 
 
20.       The Learned Additional Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the 
complainant have also relied upon the evidence of motive and submitted that it 
corroborated the ocular account. The motive of the occurrence as stated by the 

Murder Reference No.135 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 1150-J of 2019 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.130 of 2019

prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) 
in their statements recorded by the learned trial court was that  the deceased had an 
altercation with the accused Ghulam Haider (since dead) over the digging of a 
watercourse. We have scrutinized the statements of the prosecution witnesses and 
find that the motive as alleged could not be proved. During the course of cross-
examination both the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yaseen (PW-5) and 
Khalil Ahmed (PW-6) were exposed to having made dishonest improvements in 
their previous statements regarding the motive of the occurrence as narrated by 
them before the learned trial court. The prosecution witness namely Khalil Ahmad 
(PW-6)  was cross-examined in this regard and the learned trial court observed as 
under:- 
“I got recorded before the IO. that motive behind the occurrence was dispute on 
digging watercourse between us and Ghulam Haider. (Confronted with Ex.D.A. 
wherein it is not so recorded). ” 
Moreover, admittedly there was no dispute between the appellant namely 
Muhammad Arif and the deceased namely Talib Hussain. Furthermore, during the 
course of the investigation, the Investigating Officer of the case did not collect any 
evidence so as to establish that there was any grievance developing in the heart of 
the appellant as against the deceased which motivated him to act in the manner in 
which he did. Abid Aziz ASI (CW-1), the Investigating Officer of the case during 
cross-examination admitted as under:- 
“The complainant did not show me the water course upon which the dispute 
between the parties was occurred prior to this occurrence. I asked the complainant 
to show the said water course which is mentioned in the motive part of complaint, 
but the complainant did not get inspected me the same. ” (emphasis supplied)

 The prosecution witnesses failed to provide evidence enabling us to determine the 
truthfulness of the motive alleged and the fact that the said motive was so 
compelling that it could have led the appellant namely Muhammad Arif to have 
committed the Qatl-i-Amd of the deceased namely Talib Hussain. There is a 
haunting silence with regard to the minutiae of motive alleged. No independent 
witness was produced by the prosecution to prove the motive as alleged.  Even 
otherwise a tainted piece of evidence cannot corroborate another tainted piece of 
evidence. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in the case of 
Muhammad Javed v. The State (2016 SCMR 2021) as under: 
“The said related and chance witnesses had failed to receive any independent 
corroboration inasmuch as no independent proof of the motive set up by the 
prosecution had been brought on the record of the case.” 
Moreover, it is an admitted rule of appreciation of evidence that motive is only a 
supporting piece of evidence and if the ocular account is found to be unreliable 
then motive alone cannot be made the basis of conviction. 
 
21.         Considering all the above circumstances, we entertain serious doubt in our 
minds regarding the involvement of the appellant namely Muhammad Arif son of 
Ghulam Haider in the present case. It is a settled principle of law that for giving 
benefit of the doubt it is not necessary that there should be so many circumstances 
rather, if only a single circumstance creating reasonable doubt in the mind of a 
prudent person is available, then the such benefit is to be extended to an accused 
not as a matter of concession but as of right. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan 
in the case of "Muhammad Mansha Vs. The State" (2018 SCMR 772) has 
enunciated the following principle: 

Murder Reference No.135 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 1150-J of 2019 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.130 of 2019 
 
32 
 
"Needless to mention that while giving the benefit of doubt to an accused it 
is not necessary that there should be many circumstances creating doubt. 
If there is a circumstance which creates reasonable doubt in a prudent 
mind about the guilt of the accused, then the accused would be entitled to 
the benefit of such doubt, not as a matter of grace and concession, but as a 
matter of right. It is based on the maxim, "it is better that ten guilty 
persons be acquitted rather than one innocent person be convicted". 
Reliance in this behalf can be made upon the cases of Tariq Pervez v. The 
State (1995 SCMR 1345), Ghulam Qadir and 2 others v. The State (2008 
SCMR 1221), Muhammad Akramv.The State (2009 SCMR 230) and 
Muhammad Zamanv.The State (2014 SCMR 749)." 
 
Reliance is also placed on the judgment of the august Supreme Court of Pakistan 
"Najaf Ali Shah Vs. the State" (2021 S C M R 736) in which it has been held as:- 
"9. 
Mere heinousness of the offence if not proved to the hilt is not a 
ground to avail the majesty of the court to do complete justice. This is 
an established principle of law and equity that it is better that 100 
guilty persons should let off but one innocent person should not suffer. 
As the preeminent English jurist William Blackstone wrote, "Better that 
ten guilty persons escape, than that one innocent suffer." Benjamin 
Franklin, who was one of the leading figures of early American history, 
went further arguing "it is better a hundred guilty persons should 
escape than one innocent person should suffer." All the contradictions 
noted by the learned High Court are sufficient to cast a shadow of 
doubt on the prosecution's case, which entitles the petitioner to the 
right of benefit of the doubt. It is a well settled principle of law that for 
the accused to be afforded this right of the benefit of the doubt it is not 
necessary that there should be many circumstances creating 
uncertainty and if there is only one doubt, the benefit of the same must 
got to the petitioner. This Court in the case of Mst. Asia Bibi v. The 
State (PLD 2019 SC 64) while relying on the the earlier judgments of 
this Court has categorically held that "if a single circumstance creates 
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the apprehension of guilt of 
an accused, then he/she shall be entitled to such benefit not as a matter 
of grace and concession, but as of right. Reference in this regard may 
be made to the cases of Tariq Pervaiz v. The State (1998 SCMR 1345) 
and Ayub Masih v. The State (PLD 2002 SC 1048)." The same view was 
reiterated in Abdul Jabbar v. State (2010 SCMR 129) when this court 
observed that once a single loophole is observed in a case presented by 
the prosecution, such as conflict in the ocular account and medical 
evidence or presence of eye-witnesses being doubtful, the benefit of 
such loophole/lacuna in the prosecution's case automatically goes in 
favour of an accused."

22.  
 For what has been discussed above the Criminal Appeal No.1150-J of 2019 
lodged by the appellant namely Muhammad Arif son of Ghulam Haider  is allowed 
and the conviction and sentence of the appellant namely Muhammad Arif son of 
Ghulam Haider  (convict)  awarded by the learned trial court through the impugned 
judgment dated 30.10.2019 are hereby set-aside. The appellant namely 
Muhammad Arif son of Ghulam Haider  is ordered to be acquitted by extending 
him the benefit of doubt. Muhammad Arif son of Ghulam Haider  is in custody and 
he is directed to be released forthwith if not required in any other case. 
23. 
The complainant of the case filed Petition for Special Leave to Appeal 
No.130 of 2019 seeking permission to file an appeal against the acquittal of Ismail 
son of Ghulam Haider and Muhammad Jalil son of Ghulam Haider ( both since 
acquitted). This Court has observed that the learned trial court has rightly acquitted 
the said accused. This Court has scrutinized the statements of the prosecution 
witnesses and has come to the conclusion that the prosecution witnesses could not 
prove the facts in issue. It   is   important   to   note   that   according to the 
established principle of the criminal administration of justice once an acquittal is  
recorded in  favour of accused facing  criminal  charge  he  enjoys  double 
presumption  of innocence, therefore, the courts competent to interfere in the 
acquittal order should be slow in converting the same into conviction,  unless and  
until  the  said  order is  patently illegal, shocking, based on misreading  and  non-
reading  of  the record or perverse. The said principle has been enunciated by the 
august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the judgment reported as “Ghulam Sikandar 
and another Versus Mamaraz Khan and Others” (P L D 1985 Supreme Court 11) 
wherein it has been held as under: 

Murder Reference No.135 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 1150-J of 2019 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.130 of 2019 
 
34 
 
“The Court would not interfere with acquittal merely because on re-
appraisal of the evidence it comes to the conclusion different from that of 
the Court acquitting the accused provided both the conclusions are 
reasonably possible. If however. the conclusion reached by that Court was 
such that no reasonable person would conceivably reach the same and was 
impossible then this Court would interfere in exceptional cases on 
overwhelming proof resulting in conclusion and irresistible conclusion; and 
that too with a view only to avoid grave miscarriage of justice and for no 
other purpose. The important test visualised in these cases, in this behalf 
was that the finding sought to be interfered with, after scrutiny under the 
foregoing searching light, should be found wholly as artificial, shocking and 
ridiculous.” 
 
Reliance is also placed on the  judgment  reported as Muhammad   Inayat   Versus   
The   State ( 1998   SCMR   1854) wherein it has been held as under: 
“The judgment of acquittal qua Muhammad Yousaf, Muhammad Sated and 
Muhammad Nawaz cannot, in the given situation, be termed as perverse or 
foolish inasmuch as the view having been taken by the High Court can possibly 
be taken for acquitting them in the peculiar facts and circumstances of this 
case. It cannot be said that the impugned judgment of the High Court 
acquitting Muhammad Yousaf and two others is fanciful, artificial, shocking or 
ridiculous. 1t is based on convincing reasons”." 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Mst. Sughran Begum and 
another Vs. Qaiser Pervaiz and others” (2015 SCMR 1142) has held as under: 
“On acquittal, an accused person earns twofold innocence particularly, in the 
case when there are concurrent findings to that effect by the trial Court and the 
Court of First Appeal (High Court), is the bedrock principle of justice. In a 
case of acquittal, the standard and principle of appreciation of evidence is 
entirely different from that in a case of conviction. Unless the concurrent 
findings of the two Courts below are found perverse, fanciful, arbitrary and are 
based on misreading and non-reading of material evidence causing 
miscarriage of justice, the Supreme Court would not lightly disturb the same 
because on reappraisal, another view might be possible therefore, sanctity is 
attached under the law to such concurrent findings in ordinary course.” 
 Pursuant to the discussion made and conclusions arrived at above, the Petition for 
Special Leave to Appeal No.130 of 2019 as filed by the complainant, seeking 
permission to file an appeal against the acquittal of Ismail son of Ghulam Haider 
and Muhammad Jalil son of Ghulam Haider (both since acquitted), is hereby 
dismissed.
