references are collectively decided through single 
order since common questions of law, statedly 
arisen out of orders, supra, are pressed for 
determination, and reproduced infra, 
“i). 
Whether 
on 
the 
facts 
and 
under 
the 
circumstances of the case, the learned Appellate 
Tribunal has not erred in law by vacating the orders of 
lower fora wrongly relying on SRO 333(1)/2011 and 
Clause 45A of Part IV of 2nd Schedule ignoring the legal 
provision contained in Section 113 of the Ordinance? 
ii). 
Whether on the facts and circumstances of the 
case, the learned Appellate Tribunal was justified to 
allow the appeal of the Taxpayer ignoring the fact that 
the Taxpayer admittedly did not fulfill the criteria given 
in SRO 333(1) of 2011 by not filling withholding 
statements and pay tax @ 1% on monthly basis?

iii) Whether on the facts and under the circumstances of 
the case, the Learned Tribunal has not erred in law by 
blending two different provisions of law having different 
scope i.e., Minimum Tax payable u/s 113 and Minimum 
Tax payable by virtue of Clause 45A which can’t be 
interchanged with each other? 
iv)  
Whether the learned ATIR has not erred in law 
by equating “Minimum Tax” as mentioned in clause 45A 
of Part II of the Second Schedule to Ordinance with the 
“Minimum Tax” payable u/s 113 of the Ordinance 
ignoring the fact that “Minimum Tax” under various 
provisions of the Ordinance, such as section 113, 153 
and section 148, has different meanings, interpretations 
and scope?” 
2. 
Learned counsel for applicant department 
contends that concessions claimed in terms of 
clause 45A of Part IV of Second Schedule of the 
Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, as amended 
through SRO No.333(1)/2011 dated 2nd May 
2011, simply relate to concessional rates for 
withholding tax deductions in terms of sub-
section (1) of section 153 of Ordinance of 2001, 
which concessional rates have neither substituted 
rate applicable qua minimum tax liability, and 
nor 
any 
deduction 
otherwise 
made 
for 
withholding purposes was available for claiming 
adjustment of minimum tax liability, latter being 
determinable independently under section 113 of 
the Ordinance of 2001. Adds that where 
exemptions / concessional rates for the purposes 
of section 113 of the Ordinance, 2001 were 
intended, such intent was specifically manifested 
in clauses 11A, 16 and 19 of Part IV of Second 
Schedule, however, no such intent was intended 
or embodied in clause 45A, thereof. Further 
submits that Circular No.06/2011 provided 
requisite conditionality of necessary registration,

before 30th June 2011, which requirement 
remained unfulfilled, hence, taxpayer is not 
entitled to claim any concession qua concessional 
rates. Learned counsel referred to determination 
of 
questions 
in 
ITR 
No.73045/2022 
titled 
“Commissioner Inland Revenue vs. M/s Ch. Khushi 
Muhammad Prop. TAX Reference No. 09-P of 
2016, decided by Hon’ble Peshawar High Court vide 
order of 05.04.2018 and the case of “Commissioner 
Inland Revenue, Zone-II Regional Tax Office, 
Lahore vs. M/s Daewoo Pakistan Motor Way 
Services (Pvt.) Ltd.” (2022 PTD 1019). 
3. 
Learned counsel for the taxpayer defended 
the order of the Appellate Tribunal.   
4. 
Matters in issue relate to Tax years 2016 to 
2019, therefore provisions of Ordinance of 2001, 
applicable and relevant for Tax years in question, 
are appreciated for answering the questions, 
supra.  
5. 
Apparently the questions proposed suggest 
contradictions, on one hand exclusion of section 
113 of Ordinance, 2001 is claimed, in the context 
of clause 45A, and conversely plea of non-
fulfilment of conditionalities, requisite for 
availing concessional rate, is raised. 
6. 
Be that as it may, the context of the 
controversy needs to be contextualized for sake 
of clarity. Respondent taxpayer had not disputed 
applicability of section 113 of the Ordinance of 
2001 and payment of minimum tax thereunder, 

ITR No.77156/2022 
ITR No.76429/2022

which claimed that minimum tax due was paid, 
while computing minimum tax liability on 
concessional rates – 0.1% of the annual turnover.  
Hence, difference is not regarding applicability 
of section 113 of the Ordinance of 2001, for the 
purposes of taxing income of taxpayer but 
whether the concessional rate, prescribed through 
clause 45A was exclusively applicable to the 
withholding tax deductions, in terms of clause (a) 
of sub-section (1) of section 153 of the 
Ordinance of 2001 or the taxpayer was obligated 
to pay minimum tax at concessional rate under 
the proviso to clause 45A - as substituted in 
terms of SRO No.333(1)/2011 dated 02.05.2011 
and remained available till Tax Laws (Second 
Amendment) Ordinance 2001. Status of the 
taxpayer as trader of yarn was settled by the 
Tribunal and we are not inclined to embark upon 
an exercise of reviewing factual findings / 
determinations.  
  
Key to resolve the controversy is inherently 
provided by the proviso to clause 45A itself, 
which clause and proviso, during the period of 
relevant tax years, read as, 
“Clause-45A of Part IV of Second Schedule  
The rate of deduction of withholding tax under clauses (a) and 
(b) of subsection (1) of section 153 shall be one percent on 
local sales, supplies and services provided or rendered to the 
[taxpayer falling in the] following categories namely:- 
f) 
Textile and articles thereof;  
g) 
Carpets; 
h) 
Leather and articles thereof including artificial 
leather footwear;

i) 
Surgical goods; and  
j) 
Sports foods.  
Provided that withholding tax under clauses (a) and (b) 
of sub-section (1) of section 153 shall not be deducted 
from sales, supplies and services made by traders of 
yarn to the above mentioned categories of taxpayers. 
Such traders of yarn shall pay minimum tax @ 0.1% 
on their annual turnover on monthly basis on 30th day 
of each month and monthly withholding tax statement 
shall be e-filed under the provisions of section 165 of 
this Ordinance.” 
[Emphasis Supplied] 
7. 
Evidently, the concession in terms of 
proviso was exclusively extended to the traders 
of yarn. Now whether those traders of yarn, who 
claimed and intended to take advantage of 
proviso were entitled to claim benefit of 
withholding tax deductions against sales. Answer 
is inherently provided in the proviso. No 
deduction of withholding of tax under clauses (a) 
and (b) of sub-section (1) of section 153 of the 
Ordinance of 2001 was permissible. This 
restraint imposed specifically excludes incidence 
of withholding tax deductions under clause (a) of 
sub-section (1) of section 153 of the Ordinance 
of 2001. Since no deduction was permissible 
therefore no question of classification of such 
deduction as final tax, in terms of sub-section (3) 
of Ordinance, 2001 arises. It is evident that 
taxpayer had claimed income from both streams, 
covered under normal and final tax regime(s). 
Incidence of deduction of withholding tax under 
clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 153 of 
Ordinance of 2001 and claiming benefit of 
proviso are mutually exclusive. The allegations,

therefore, that withholding tax deductions were 
claimed 
as 
corresponding 
adjustment 
of 
minimum tax liability are misconceived. Hence, 
no question of ignoring the applicability of 
section 113 of the Ordinance of 2001 arises and 
in fact order of Appellate Tribunal is not fully 
comprehended.  
8. 
Second portion of proviso is indubitably 
clear, which extends concessional rate for traders 
of yarn for the purposes of computing minimum 
tax liability. We, in exercise of jurisdiction 
extended, are not the court of fact and will not 
proceed to determine question of fulfilment of 
conditionalities – a fact-question. It is otherwise 
evident from the perusal of orders in both set of 
references that Commissioner had acknowledged 
factum of applicability of clause 45A, supra, for 
the purposes of computation of minimum tax 
liability but alleged that conditions were not met, 
which findings of fact was reversed by the 
Appellate Tribunal, which had recorded findings 
that taxpayers were eligible for the concessional 
rates. Judgments referred had no application in 
the context of the facts and controversy at hand. 
We are unable to find any adjudication in the 
context of applicability of SRO 06/2011 by the 
Tribunal. Hence, any reference is misconceived. 
We are not dilating upon allegations of non-
fulfillment of conditions, which issue was 
adjudicated and rejected by the Tribunal.

Question (i) is proposed in negative format, 
therefore same is answered in negative and we 
hold that Appellate Tribunal had neither ignored 
the import of section 113 of the Ordinance of 
2001 nor committed any error of law. Question 
(ii) is factual, and this court will not hold an 
inquiry to ascertain factum of compliance of the 
conditions prescribed for the purposes of availing 
concessional rates. Question (iii) is answered in 
negative, Tribunal has not committed any 
illegality, which rightly construed the scope and 
effect of proviso to clause 45A and correctly 
allowed concessional rates for the purposes of 
minimum tax liability. Question (iv) is answered 
in negative, and no error was committed by the 
Appellate Tribunal while construing section 113 
of the Ordinance and clause 45A – for the 
purposes of relevant tax years. All Reference 
Applications are decided against the department 
and in favour of the taxpayer(s). 
 
Office shall send a copy of this order, under 
seal of the Court, to learned Appellate Tribunal, 
in terms of sub-section (5) of section 133 of the 
Ordinance, 2001.
