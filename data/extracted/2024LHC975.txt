RASAAL HASAN SYED, J. This petition stems 
from order dated 05.4.2023 of the learned Addl. 
District Judge, Faisalabad in terms whereof the 
appeal of respondent No.1/Niaz Ahmad  against 
order of his eviction dated 06.9.2022 was 
accepted; the order was set aside and the ejectment 
application brought by petitioner was dismissed. 
2. 
Brief facts out of which this petition arises 
are that on 6.7.2021 petitioner filed an application 
for ejectment of respondent No.1 from a house No. 
173-P, covering an area of 04 marlas and 111 sqft 
located at District Faisalabad on grounds of default 
in payment of rent and unauthorized structural 
changes. Stance taken therein was that the property 

 
 
 
 
   
 
 W.P. No.38767 of 2023 
 
 
          Page-2 
 
 
 
was rented out in favour of respondent No.1 on a 
monthly rent of Rs. 6,000/- in March 2019 in the 
presence of Painda Khan and Muhammad Ejaz. 
The tenancy was oral, the respondent paid the rent 
but after the death of petitioner’s predecessor 
namely Umer Hayat, the respondent did not pay 
rent from January 2021 and also raised illegal 
structural changes including blockage of passage 
of first floor. In view of the default and illegal 
structural changes, respondent’s eviction was 
solicited. Respondent No.1 denied the relationship 
of landlord and tenant; claimed that he was in 
occupation of the property as an owner on the plea 
of agreement of sale dated 26.6.2018. Leave to 
contest was allowed by the Rent Tribunal; issues 
were framed whereafter parties led oral and 
documentary evidence. On consideration of entire 
evidence the Rent Tribunal allowed the ejectment 
petition vide order dated 06.9.2022; directed the 
respondent to deliver the vacant possession of the 
property to the petitioner and also pay the arrears 
of rent and future rent at the agreed rate with utility 
bills till delivery of possession. Appeal filed by the 
respondent No.1 was allowed, and judgment of 
Rent Tribunal was set aside. The order of learned

has been challenged in the instant petition. 
3. 
Heard. 
4. 
As 
observed 
supra 
the 
ejectment 
of 
respondent No.1 was claimed on the basis of 
default in payment of rent and unauthorized 
structural changes. The case of the petitioner was 
that she along with her husband were owners of 
noted house and that on the death of her husband 
she along with the remaining petitioners being 
legal heirs of the deceased became joint owners. It 
was claimed that respondent No.1 was inducted as 
a tenant on a monthly rent of Rs. 6,000/- with 10% 
annual increase;  induction of respondent No.1 was 
in the presence of  Painda Khan and Muhammad 
Ejaz; the respondent paid the rent but defaulted 
from January 2021 and that the respondent 
illegally made structural changes in the rented 
premises. As against this respondent No.1 claimed 
that he was owner of property by virtue of 
agreement dated 26.6.2018 allegedly executed by 
Umer Hayat son of Taj Muhammad, late husband 
of petitioner No.1 and had paid total price of 
Rs.60,00,000/- which was allegedly acknowledged 

 
 
 
 
   
 
 W.P. No.38767 of 2023 
 
 
          Page-4 
 
 
 
vide receipt dated 26.6.2018 and had allegedly 
filed a suit for specific performance on 29.11.2021. 
5. 
In view of the stance taken by respondent 
No.1 issue of relationship of landlord and tenant 
was framed, along with the issues on merits. 
Petitioner produced oral evidence of A.W.1 to 
A.W.3. Petitioner/Shamim Umer appeared as 
A.W.1 while Muhammad Ejaz and Painda Khan 
witnesses appeared as A.W.2 
and A.W.3. 
Documents comprising Exh.A-1 to Exh.A-10 were 
tendered in evidence while some other documents 
were placed as Mark-A to Mark-C. Respondent 
No.1 appeared as R.W.1 and produced Muhammad 
Amin and Muhammad Adnan as R.W.2 and 
R.W.3. Their affidavits were produced as Exh.R-1 
to Exh.R-3 while agreement to sell was produced 
as Exh.R-4, receipt of earnest money was Exh.R-5, 
Front Desk Receipt was Exh.R-6, application to 
SHO as Exh.R-7 and an application to DCO was 
placed as Mark-A. 
6. 
Petitioner No.1 in her evidence candidly 
deposed that respondent No.1 was rented the 
property in March 2019; that the respondent 
committed default after January 2021 and raised 
illegal construction. She deposed that the oral 

 
 
 
 
   
 
 W.P. No.38767 of 2023 
 
 
          Page-5 
 
 
 
tenancy was created in the presence of A.W.2 and 
A.W. 3 who in their statements corroborated the 
stance of the petitioner. She denied execution or 
existence of any sale agreement and alleged receipt 
of payment. She also produced copies of two 
registered deeds to prove that she was owner along 
with her husband Umer Hayat and that Umer 
Hayat was only owner to the extent of 02 marlas 
while the remaining part of 02 marlas was owned 
by petitioner No.1. Copy of the sale deeds dated 
29.6.2018 were tendered in evidence as Exh.A-4 
and Exh.A-5. After demise of her husband Umer 
Hayat on 27.11.2020 the property to the extent of 
his share was also mutated in favour of his legal 
heirs as mentioned in the Jamaband   at Mark-B 
and Mark-C. In this backdrop she claimed that all 
the petitioners were owners/landlords of property 
in question. Her statement in respect of induction 
of respondent No.1 as tenant in the property was 
duly supported by A.W.2 and A.W.3. The 
petitioner, therefore, satisfactorily discharged the 
onus of proving the tenancy through her evidence. 
As against this the plea of respondent was that he 
had purchased the property and was owner thereof. 
In defence reliance was placed on an agreement of 

 
 
 
 
   
 
 W.P. No.38767 of 2023 
 
 
          Page-6 
 
 
 
sale which shows that the property was allegedly 
agreed to be purchased for Rs. 60,00,000/- from 
Umer Hayat on 26.6.2018. Exh.A-4 shows that 
only Umer Hayat was not owner of the 04 marla 
house; rather he and his wife were co-owners and 
Umer Hayat’s share was 02 marlas. Therefore, he 
could not have executed the document for the sale 
of total property. Secondly sale agreement was 
claimed to have been executed on 26.6.2018 while 
sale deed Exh.A-4 itself was registered on 
29.6.2018 which means that the petitioner claimed 
that the alleged purchase of property was before 
the sale deed in favour of the vendor came into 
existence 
or 
in 
other 
words 
respondent’s 
agreement was claimed to be before the purchase 
of property by the petitioners or their predecessor 
which obviously could not be possible.  
7. 
Respondent No.1 raised the claim of having 
been intending buyer of the property pursuant to an 
agreement of sale dated 26.6.2018 which was 
seriously denied by the petitioners  and his 
witnesses while the document was claimed to be 
concocted and forged and not ever had been 
executed by Umer Hayat deceased husband of 
petitioner No.1.  Onus to establish and prove the 

 
 
 
 
   
 
 W.P. No.38767 of 2023 
 
 
          Page-7 
 
 
 
execution and existence of agreement Exh.R-4 and 
Receipt Exh.R-5 was upon the respondent No.1. 
These two documents were claimed to be attested 
by Muhammad Amin and Muhammad Adnan as 
attesting witnesses. Evidence of the respondent 
comprised 
of 
R.W.1 
(respondent 
himself), 
Muhammad Amin R.W.2 and Muhammad Adnan 
R.W.3. It is observed that the statement of R.W.1 
i.e. respondent himself was cross-examined by the 
opposite side but R.W. 2 and R.W.3 did not appear 
for their cross-examination despite being given 
opportunities and ultimately the respondent 
himself voluntarily closed his oral evidence on 
21.7.2022. It is thus a case where the statement of 
R.W.2 and R.W.3 will be deemed to be unreliable, 
inadmissible and not considered as a part of 
evidence. Under law the statement of a witness 
comprises 
examination-in-chief 
and 
cross-
examination. The exercise of cross-examination is 
right of the opposite side as a device of due 
process to provide opportunity to show the 
statement 
to 
be 
false 
and 
unworthy 
of 
consideration. If the witness does not turn up       
for cross-examination nor the party produced such 
witness or show any interest to produce the 

 
 
 
 
   
 
 W.P. No.38767 of 2023 
 
 
          Page-8 
 
 
 
witness, the presumption will be that the witness 
was not prepared to face the truth and that his 
statement 
is 
not 
worthy 
of 
consideration. 
Reference can be made to the case of Mst. Nasim 
Sharif v. Imtiaz Ali Khan and 3 others (2006 CLC 
1393) where it was observed to the effect that if 
the witness during cross-examination boycotted 
the proceedings or walked out from the court along 
with his counsel, the trial court may refuse to read 
the statement in evidence as such conduct of the 
witness will be uncalled for and alien to judicial 
process and that the party having refused to be 
subjected to cross-examination must face the 
consequences. In Abid Ali v. The State (2022 
P.Cr.LJ 1088) it was observed to the effect that 
where after the examination-in-chief the case is 
adjourned for cross-examination and subsequently 
the witness does not turn up or is not made 
available for cross-examination, statement without 
cross-examination could not be termed as legal 
statement as it had lost its evidentiary value and 
must not be considered being unreliable piece of 
evidence. In so far as the affidavits as statement in 
examination-in-chief of witnesses tendered, the 
same are also unworthy of consideration as in law 

 
 
 
 
   
 
 W.P. No.38767 of 2023 
 
 
          Page-9 
 
 
 
the deponent unless appears for cross-examination 
and allow this opportunity to the opposite side, the 
affidavit of the witness would be deemed in law 
inadmissible and unworthy of credence. Reference 
can be made to the case of Mst. Shahnaz Begum v. 
Muhammad Shafi and others (PLD 2004 Lah. 
290).  
8. 
From the resume of facts it is discernible that 
respondent No.1 could not prove the existence and 
execution of sale agreement dated 26.6.2018 in as 
much as neither the witnesses of the document 
appeared for cross-examination or were willing to 
expose them to the critical questions of cross- 
examination nor the deed writer, stamp vendor or 
any other person supported the plea of execution of 
the document through any admissible evidence. It 
was thus a case of uncorroborated statement of 
respondent No.1 which obviously could not save 
him from the consequences. As per settled rule, a 
document which is required to be attested by two 
witnesses need to be proved by production of two 
marginal witnesses who shall make complete 
statement i.e. examination-in-chief and cross-
examination which course having not been 
followed in this case. In the case of Dawa Khan 

 
 
 
 
   
 
 W.P. No.38767 of 2023 
 
 
          Page-10 
 
 
 
through L.Rs and others v. Muhammad Tayyab 
(2013 SCMR 1113) it was observed to the effect  
that admissibility of the documents in evidence, by 
itself will not absolve the party from proving its 
contents in terms of Article 79 provided under the 
scheme of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984.  In 
Province of Punjab through Collector Sheikhupura 
and others v. Syed Ghazanfar Ali Shah and others 
(2017 SCMR 172) it was observed to the effect 
that the provisions of Articles 72 to 101 of Qanun-
e-Shahadat Order, 1984 governing the mode of 
proof could not be compounded or dispensed with 
nor could the court  which had to pronounce a 
judgment  as to the proof or otherwise of the 
document is precluded to see whether  the 
document had been proved in accordance with law  
and could, as such, form basis of a judgment. In 
the case of Messrs Bengal Friends And Co. Dacca 
v. Messrs Dour Benode Saha And Co. and the 
Deputy Registrar of Trade Marks, Chittagan (PLD 
1969 SC 477) where the document was claimed to 
have been executed it was observed to the effect 
that if a document is alleged to have written by any 
person, the signatures or the hand writing  of so 
much of the document and is alleged to be in that 

 
 
 
 
   
 
 W.P. No.38767 of 2023 
 
 
          Page-11 
 
 
 
person’s handwriting must be proved to be in his 
hand writing and that mere fact that the production 
of document  kept in regular course of business did 
not constitute evidence of the entries contained 
therein unless the same is proved in accordance 
with law.     
9. 
Another important aspect in the matter which 
cannot be overlooked is that the respondent 
claimed to have paid the total price of 
Rs.60,00,000/- at the time of alleged execution of 
agreement of sale which is surprising as it does not 
speak to the reasons as to why the sale deed could 
not be registered at that time if there was no legal 
obstruction, encumbrances or any restraining 
order. This obviously reflect fraud and raises 
serious doubts to the existence of any such 
document. It is also proved on record that Umer 
Hayat did not own 04 marlas 111 sq. ft. and only 
owned 02 marlas, obviously being so he could not 
agree for transfer for the area not owned by him. 
So much so the agreement was never alleged 
during three years or during the lifetime of Umer 
Hayat. The record shows that ejectment petition 
was filed on 06.7.2021 while the agreement was 
claimed to be dated 26.6.2018 and during this 

 
 
 
 
   
 
 W.P. No.38767 of 2023 
 
 
          Page-12 
 
 
 
period no notice was sent or proceedings initiated 
to claim existence and enforcement of any sale 
agreement.  The facts noted supra proved that the 
agreement was fabricated subsequently fabricated 
to concoct the story of alleged intending sale. The 
learned Rent Tribunal did take into consideration 
all these facts on record and reached the 
conclusion that the agreement could not be proved 
or established which findings were interfered with 
by the Addl. District Judge by misreading the 
evidence and in violation of law.   
10. As regards the respondent’s objection that 
the oral tenancy was claimed and that there was no 
document to support it, the same is ill founded.  In 
law a tenant means a person who undertakes or is 
bound to pay the rent as consideration for the 
occupation of the premises by him and includes a 
person who continues to be in occupation of the 
premises after the termination of his tenancy as 
also legal heirs of the tenant after his demise. 
There is no restriction in law to the nature of 
tenancy which can be either oral or in writing.  It is 
also a rule that if a person occupies the premises 
which is owned by other person then his status 
could be presumed to be as a tenant unless proved 

 
 
 
 
   
 
 W.P. No.38767 of 2023 
 
 
          Page-13 
 
 
 
otherwise. Petitioner in this case inducted the 
respondent as tenant who attempted to raise the 
defence of being in part performance of agreement 
of sale but could not prove the same.  In the given 
circumstances his status was only of a tenant as 
claimed by the petitioner and proved on record by 
the evidence of A.W. 1 to A.W.3.  Reference can 
be made to the rule in case of Shajar Islam v. 
Muhammad Siddique (PLD 2007 SC 45) where it 
was observed that in the absence of any evidence 
in rebuttal of the title of the landlord there would 
be strong presumption as to the existence of 
tenancy between the parties. Reference can also be 
made to the rule in Ahmad Ali alias Ali Ahmad v. 
Nasr Ud Din and another (PLD 2009 SC 453) in 
this regard.  
11. In view of the rule supra, the objection raised 
by the respondent is not legally tenable. The 
learned Rent Tribunal did take care of the entire 
evidence and the legal position and by properly 
construing the same allowed the ejectment petition 
but the learned Addl. District Judge, misconstrued 
the law, misread the evidence and a result of 
erroneous assumption of law, passed the impugned 
order which is not sustainable. 

 
 
 
 
   
 
 W.P. No.38767 of 2023

12. For the reasons herein above, this petition is 
allowed; order dated 05.4.2023 of the learned 
Addl. District Judge, Faisalabad is declared to be 
illegal, without lawful authority and jurisdiction is 
accordingly set aside.  In result, the order dated 
06.9.2022 of the Rent Tribunal, Faisalabad is 
restored. Respondent No.1 is allowed 60 days to 
vacate the premises and deliver its vacant 
possession to the petitioner. No order as to costs.
