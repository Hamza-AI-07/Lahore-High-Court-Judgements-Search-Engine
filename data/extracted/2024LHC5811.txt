Department passed on the directions issued in this 
Court on 18.03.2024 in (earlier) Writ Petition 
No.803/2024 filed by the Respondent No.4 i.e. 
M/s Coca Cola Beverages Pakistan Limited (the 
“Company”) under Sections 146(3), 147 and 148 
of the Punjab Local Government Act, 2022 (the 
“Act”) read with Rule 10 of the Punjab 
Government Rules of Business, 2011 (the 
“Rules”) which is the constitutional power of the 
Secretary Local Government & Community 
Development Department under the “Rules” as 
held by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in Messrs 
Mustafa Impex, Karachi and others versus The 

2 
W.P.No.3768/2024 
Government of Pakistan through Secretary 
Finance, Islamabad and others (PLD 2016 SC 
808) holding that the Rules of Business flowed 
from the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”) is mandatory 
and binding on the Government. This case is being 
decided by this Court by applying the principle of 
limine control developed in the cases of Asif 
Saleem versus Chairman BOG University of 
Lahore and others (PLD 2019 Lahore 407), 
Messrs Colony Textile Mills Limited and another 
versus First Punjab Modaraba (2021 CLD 1212) 
and Muhammad Shehzad versus Faisal Bank 
Limited (2024 CLD 141).  
A. 
Background 
2. 
Through this petition under Article 199 of 
the “Constitution” the Petitioner has called in 
question the vires of impugned order dated 
17.10.2024 passed by Respondent No.1/Secretary, 
Local Government & Community Development 
Department. 
B. 
Confrontation to Petitioner’s Counsel 
3. 
When confronted to counsel for the 
Petitioner Syed Qamar Hussain Shah Sabzwari, 
ASC how writ is maintainable against the 
impugned order which has been passed by the 
Respondent No.1 pursuant to the direction issued 
by this Court on 18.03.2024 in (earlier) Writ 
Petition No.803/2024 filed by the “Company”, 
Syed Qamar Hussain Shah Sabzwari, ASC 

3 
W.P.No.3768/2024 
submits that the Petitioner is the contractor and has 
been awarded a contract by the Municipal 
Corporation, Murree to collect advertisement fee 
for the year 2023-24 of the areas mentioned in 
work order dated 25.07.2023. He further submits 
that demand notice has also been issued in favour 
of the Petitioner on 29.11.2023 to which the 
Company has not raised any objection at the 
relevant time but subsequently, it has filed the 
aforesaid writ petition and pursuant to the 
direction of this Court, the (Secretary) Respondent 
No.1 has passed the impugned order by reducing 
the rate of advertisement fee from Rs.400 per 
square foot per annum to Rs.100 per square foot 
per annum, which is illegal and without lawful 
authority. He contends that the Respondent No.1 
has no authority to reduce the rate of 
advertisement. He clarifies that as per provisions 
of Section 110 of the Punjab Local Government 
Act, 2022 (the “Act”), a person aggrieved from the 
order of a Chief Officer passed under Section 109 
of the Act, may, within thirty days of the receipt of 
such order, file an appeal before head of the local 
government which shall be decided within thirty 
days. He submits that head of the local government 
is defined in Section 2(rr) of the Act as the (i) Lord 
Mayor of Metropolitan Corporation Lahore; (ii) 
City Mayor of a Metropolitan Corporation other 
than Lahore; (iii) District Mayor of a District

Arguments of Law Officer 
4. 
Learned law officer has objected to 
maintainability of the petition and submitted that 
the impugned order has been passed strictly in 
accordance with law by the Secretary Local 
Government 
& 
Community 
Development 
Department under the “Act” and the “Rules” 
which is the direct command under Article 139 of 
the “Constitution”.   
D. 
Determination by the Court 
5. 
Heard. Albeit the Respondent No.4/ 
Company has approached this Court in the 
aforesaid writ petition but this Court has referred 
the matter to the Respondent No.1 with a direction 
to decide the same after hearing all concerned, 
including the Petitioner, by also granting an 
interim relief in the said petition. This Court has 
already discussed in detail and strengthened the 
provincial autonomy after Eighteenth Amendment 
to the Constitution in the case of Muhammad 
Yousaf versus Secretary Finance and others (PLD 
2021 Lahore 156)=[2021 PLC (CS) 195] by 
highlighting 
functions 
of 
the 
government 
departments/forums throughout the Province of 
Punjab in light of Article 127 read with the 
provisions of Article 139 of the Constitution. In a 

5 
W.P.No.3768/2024 
subsequent judgment reported as Ch. Fayyaz 
Hussain versus Province of Punjab and others 
(PLD 2022 Lahore 1), this Court, while dealing 
with an issue relating to the Rescue 1122, has 
further strengthened the scope of government 
departments rendering services in the Province of 
Punjab by observing as under: 
“…Word ‘department’ is defined under R. 
2(i) of the Punjab Government Rules of 
Business, 2011, which means a self-
contained administrative unit in the 
Secretariat responsible for the conduct of 
business of the Government in a distinct and 
specified 
sphere, 
and 
declared 
or 
constituted.” 
 
6. 
Here in this case, Rules 3 and 10 of the 
Punjab Government Rules of Business, 2011 (the 
“Rules”) are relevant. Under Rule 3(3) of the 
Rules, business of the Government has been 
distributed amongst several Departments in the 
manner indicated in the Second Schedule and 
functions of the Secretary are described under 
Rule 10 of the 2011 Rules, which is reproduced 
hereunder for ease of the matter:- 
“10. Functions of the Secretary.– (1) A 
Secretary shall: 
(a) 
be the official head of the 
 
Department 
and 
be 
 
responsible for its efficient 
 
administration and discipline, 
 
for the conduct of business 
 
assigned to the Department 
 
and for the observance of laws 
 
and rules, including these 
 
rules, in the Department;  

6 
W.P.No.3768/2024 
(b)  
be responsible to the Minister 
 
for 
the 
business 
of 
the 
 
Department and keep him 
 
informed about the working of 
 
the 
Department, 
and 
of 
 
important cases disposed of 
 
without 
reference 
to 
the 
 
Minister;  
(c)  
assist the Minister in the 
 
formulation of policy and 
 
bring to the notice of the 
 
Minister cases required to be 
 
submitted 
to 
the 
Chief 
 
Minister under the rules;  
(d) 
execute 
the 
sanctioned 
 
policy;  
(e)  
submit, with the approval 
 
of the  Minister, proposals for 
 
legislation to the Cabinet;  
(f)  
keep 
the 
Chief 
Secretary 
 
informed of important cases 
 
disposed 
of 
in 
the 
 
Department;  
(g)  
issue, subject to any general 
 
or special orders of the 
 
Government: 
 
i) 
standing 
orders 
 
specifying the cases or 
 
class of cases which 
 
may be disposed of by 
 
an officer subordinate 
 
to the Secretary; and 
 
ii) specific orders and 
 
instructions 
to 
its 
 
officers for the conduct 
 
of the business assigned 
 
to a local government. 
 
(2) While submitting a case for the 
 
orders of the Minister, the Secretary 
 
shall suggest a definite line of 
 
action.  
 
(3) Where the Minister’s orders 
 
appear to contravene any law, rules, 
 
regulations or Government policy, 
 
the Secretary shall resubmit the case 
 
to the Minister inviting his attention 
 
to 
the 
relevant 
law, 
rules, 
 
regulations  or Government policy, 

7 
W.P.No.3768/2024 
 
and if the Minister disagrees with 
 
the Secretary, the Minister may refer 
 
the case to the Chief Minister for 
 
orders.” 
 
This Court, while interpreting the aforesaid 
provisions of the Rules first time has given verdict 
regarding responsibilities and functions of the 
heads of government departments in the case of 
PIA Officers Cooperative Housing Society Ltd. 
through President versus Province of Punjab 
through Secretary to the Government of Punjab, 
Cooperatives Department, Lahore and 4 others 
(2024 CLC 947) by holding that the Secretary, 
being official head of the department, is 
responsible for its efficient administration and 
discipline, for the conduct of business assigned to 
the department and for the observance of laws and 
rules. This concept has subsequently been further 
strengthened by this Court in another case cited as 
Muhammad Banaras versus Government of the 
Punjab etc. (PLJ 2024 Lahore 242). In the 
aforesaid earlier Writ Petition of the Respondent 
No.4/Coca Cola, this Court, vide order dated 
18.03.2024, has directed the Respondent No.1 to 
decide the matter under Rule 10 of the Rules in 
light of the principles settled in PIA’s Case 
(supra) and Secretary, Local Government & 
Community Development Department has passed 
the impugned order dated 17.10.2024 strictly 

8 
W.P.No.3768/2024 
under Rule 10(g) of the Rules by specifically 
mentioning as under: 
“…The matter at hand was also referred to 
the 
Director 
(Accounts), 
LG&CD 
Department to be inquired into. As per the 
report submitted by the said officer “the 
dispute over the rates charged for 
advertisement 
boards 
stems 
from 
a 
misclassification of the boards as Neon 
Signs. Based on the definitions and evidence 
provided, it is clear that the complaint’s 
advertisement boards do not meet the 
criteria for Neon Signs and may be billed at 
a lower rate. By reclassifying the boards 
and issuing revised bills, as MC Murree 
previously charged an Advertisement tax @ 
100 rupees per square foot per annum for 
the same type of Advertisement Boards 
during the same financial year. MC, Murree 
can resolve the dispute amicably and ensure 
fair and accurate taxation for advertisement 
boards. It is further added that the 
complainant should ensure the payment of 
advertisement bills within seven days after 
resolution of the dispute.” 
 
The issue raised in this case relates to the reduction 
of advertisement fee and since the Secretary,  
Local Government & Community Development 
Department functions under the command of the 
Constitution, as per Rule 10 read with First 
Schedule and Second Schedule of the 2011 Rules, 
which have been framed under Article 139 of the 
Constitution in addition to powers under Section 
146(3) of the “Act”, he is fully competent to 
administer the laws [including the rules framed 
under the said laws] mentioned under Clause 15 of 
Second Schedule to the Rules.  

9 
W.P.No.3768/2024 
 
The aforesaid Section 146(3) of the “Act” reads as 
under: 
146. Supervision of local governments  
 
(1)-------------------------------------- 
(2)-------------------------------------- 
(3) The Secretary shall exercise supervision 
and general control over the local 
governments to ensure that they always act 
in the public interest and perform their 
functions strictly in accordance with the 
provisions of this Act and all other relevant 
laws for the time being in force. 
 
 
The aforesaid provision of law is similar to 
powers prescribed under Rule 10 of the “Rules, 
hence in paragraph-5 of the impugned order, the 
Respondent No.1 has categorically stated that 
advertisement fee being charged to the Company 
(the Respondent No.4) is at variance with the 
gazette notification dated 29.08.2018. He has also 
obtained a report from the Director (Accounts), 
LG & CD Department to clarify the aspect that 
advertisement boards of the Respondent No.4 do 
not meet the criteria for Neon Signs and may be 
billed at a lower rate. This action of reduction in 
advertisement fee has also strengthened the 
protection of foreign investors in Pakistan, as has 
already been discussed by this Court in the 
judgment reported as M.C.R. (Pvt) Ltd, franchisee 
of Pizza Hut versus Multan Development 
Authority and others (2021 CLD 639), relevant 

10 
W.P.No.3768/2024 
paragraphs 28 and 29 of which are reproduced 
hereunder for ease of the matter: 
“28. Undoubtedly freedom of trade, 
business and commerce is a fundamental 
right guaranteed under Article 18 of the 
Constitution which states that every citizen 
shall have the right to enter upon any lawful 
profession or occupation, and to conduct 
any lawful trade or business. One of the 
basic purposes behind provision of this 
fundamental right is certainly to advance 
culture of socio-economic progress and to 
protect and promote business and trade 
activities and, at the same time, to 
encourage simplification of the process of 
establishing 
and 
carrying 
out 
new 
business ventures throughout the country 
because activities of business and trade 
create opportunities for the masses around 
and provide job options, financial stability 
and progress in the area. 
29. 
Since 
the 
Pizza 
Hut 
is 
an 
international chain and entered into lease 
agreement with WASA, it is the duty of the 
Courts in Pakistan to see the rights of the 
parties and to protect their interest in order 
to build confidence of investors in 
Pakistan but at the same time the interest 
of government functionaries has also to be 
examined regarding financial interest of  
the Government.” 
 
7. 
In response to the Court queries (i) what is 
locus standi of the Petitioner; (ii) how a contractor 
can levy advertisement fee under the concept 
developed by the Division Bench of Sindh High 
Court in the case of Continental Biscuits Ltd 
versus Federation of Pakistan through Secretary 
Defence, Ministry of Defence, Islamabad and 3 
others (2017 PTD 1803=2017 YLR 2155) and 
(iii) whether the impugned order is directly hitting 

11 
W.P.No.3768/2024 
rights of the Petitioner because the same has been 
passed in the public interest, learned counsel for 
the Petitioner has reiterated his aforesaid 
submissions and could not satisfy the Court on the 
aforesaid queries. Moreover, Section 99 of the Act 
provides mechanism for levy of tax and Part-I (l) 
of Fifth Schedule of the Act deals with the fee for 
regulation of advertisement through sign boards, 
hoardings, cutouts, neon-signs, pole signs, sky 
signs and boards; billboards; directional boards, 
banners, streamers, moppy signs, temporary 
advertisement structures and stalls, posters, one 
way visions, hot air balloons and blimps, moving 
vehicles, electronic display screens including 
Light Emitting Diode (LED) and Surface Mounted 
Device (SMD), etc.  
8. 
The nutshell of the above discussion is that 
since the (Secretary) Respondent No.1 is the 
incharge of the Local Government & Community 
Development Department and he has passed the 
impugned order strictly as per mandate of Section 
146(3), 147 and 148 of the “Act” in addition to 
Rule 10(1) of the Rules, which are made under 
Article 139(2) of the Constitution, providing that 
the Provincial Government shall by rules specify 
the manner in which orders and other instruments 
made and executed shall be authenticated, and    
the validity of any order or instrument so 
authenticated shall not be questioned in any Court 

12 
W.P.No.3768/2024 
on the ground that it was not made or executed by 
the Governor, and further in the case of Messrs 
Mustafa Impex, Karachi and others versus The 
Government of Pakistan through Secretary 
Finance, Islamabad and others (PLD 2016 SC 
808), the Supreme Court of Pakistan, while 
highlighting the importance of Rules of Business, 
has already held that the Rules of Business cannot 
be understated within a constitutional framework 
and all rules are binding for, and in relation to, the 
powers thereby conferred on the Executive, this is 
especially so in the case of the Rules of Business. 
In the said case, the Supreme Court of Pakistan has 
further observed that the Rules of Business are 
closely intertwined with the concept of good 
governance for and in the public interest and 
allowing a departure therefrom would be 
detrimental to open and transparent forms of 
government, therefore, it can be safely stated that 
the Rules have the constitutional command 
because the same have been made under Article 
139 of the Constitution. In this legal backdrop, no 
interference is required by this Court and by 
applying the principle of limine control developed 
in the cases of Asif Saleem versus Chairman BOG 
University of Lahore and others (PLD 2019 
Lahore 407), Messrs Colony Textile Mills Limited 
and another versus First Punjab Modaraba (2021 
CLD 1212) and Muhammad Shehzad versus 

13 
W.P.No.3768/2024 
Faisal Bank Limited (2024 CLD 141), this writ 
petition is dismissed in limine.
