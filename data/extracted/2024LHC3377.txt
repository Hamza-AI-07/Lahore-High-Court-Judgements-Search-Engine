2. 
 
Shorn 
of 
unnecessary 
details, 
the 
petitioners’ 
predecessor namely Abdul Majeed got incorporated mutation 
No.1710 dated 27.01.2014 on the basis of decree dated 02.06.1998 
passed in a suit for specific performance of an agreement to sell 
dated 15.01.1986; that said mutation was reviewed and set aside  by 
respondent No.4 vide order dated 25.09.2014 and appeal preferred 
by the predecessor of the petitioners was dismissed in-limine by 
respondent No.3 on 28.01.2016; that predecessor of the petitioners 
assailed said orders through filing a revision petition which was 
allowed by respondent No.2 vide order dated 15.03.2017; that 
respondents No.5 to 12 challenged said order through revision of 
revision (ROR No.702 of 2017) which was accepted by respondent 
No.1 vide impugned order dated 27.02.2018. Being dissatisfied, the 
petitioners have assailed said order dated 27.02.2018 of respondent 
No.1 through instant petition. 
3. 
 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties at full length 
and perused the record with their able assistance. 
4. 
 
It is evident from the record that predecessor of the 
petitioners namely Abdul Majeed instituted a suit for specific 
performance on 24.01.1987 and sought performance of an agreement 
to sell dated 15.01.1986, whereby, Muhammad Rafique (respondent 
No.13) agreed to sell half portion of his shop measuring 3 Sirsahi 
bearing Khasra No.100/2/2, out of total shop measuring 06 Sirsahi 
for a consideration of Rs.25,000/- while an amount of Rs.15,000/- 
was paid as earnest money. He also challenged the entries of 
mutation No.533 dated 04.02.1986, whereby, respondent No.13 sold 

Writ Petition No.13531 of 2018. 
-3-
the suit shop to predecessor of respondents No.5 to 12 namely 
Gulzar Ahmad for a consideration of Rs.70,000/-. Said suit, after 
full-fledged trial was decreed by the learned trial Court vide 
judgment and decree dated 02.06.1998 subject to deposit of the 
remaining consideration amount of Rs.10,000/- within a period of 
one month, failing which the suit shall be deemed to have been 
dismissed and that the mutation No.533 dated 04.02.1986 become 
effective. Respondents No.5 to 12 assailed said judgment and decree 
of learned trial Court by preferring an appeal which was dismissed 
vide judgment and decree dated 12.03.2002. The predecessor of the 
petitioners remained silent for about 10 years and thereafter he 
moved an application to the District Collector for implementation of 
the decree which was dismissed vide order dated 17.01.2012 with an 
observation that the petitioners should have approached the learned 
executing Court for execution of the decree. In the light of said 
observation, predecessor of the petitioners filed an execution petition 
on 27.03.2012 which was subsequently withdrawn and said 
execution petition was dismissed as withdrawn vide order dated 
26.01.2013. During the pendency of said execution petition, the 
petitioners somehow succeeded to get incorporate mutation No.1652 
on 14.11.2012 on the basis of decree. Said mutation was 
subsequently reviewed and set aside vide order dated 20.11.2012 and 
appeal against it was dismissed vide order dated 26.12.2013. 
Thereafter, predecessor of the petitioners instituted a suit for 
declaration and sought declaration of his title upon the suit property 
on the basis of decree dated 02.06.1998. Said suit was also dismissed 

Writ Petition No.13531 of 2018. 
-4-
as withdrawn vide order dated 25.03.2015. 
Subsequently, 
predecessor of the petitioners again succeeded to get incorporate 
mutation No.1710 on 27.01.2014. Said mutation was also dismissed 
by respondent No.3 while exercising the power of review vide order 
dated 25.09.2014. Predecessor of the petitioners assailed said order 
through preferring an appeal which was dismissed in-limine by 
respondent No.3 vide order dated 28.01.2016. However, revision of 
the petitioners against said orders was allowed by respondent No.2 
vide order dated 15.03.2017 and restored the mutation No.1710 
dated 27.01.2014. Respondents No.5 to 12 assailed said order 
through filing revision of revision (ROR No.702 of 2017) before 
respondent No.1 which was allowed vide impugned order dated 
27.02.2018. 
5. 
 
No doubt a decree of specific performance exists in 
favour of predecessor of the petitioners. It is settled principle of law 
that decree never dies but the restriction of limitation always became 
a barrier for the enforcement of the decree through execution after 
prescribed period of limitation, however, it does not extinguish the 
right or title based on the decree.  
6. 
 
Admittedly, decree passed in favour of the predecessor 
of the petitioners was conditional subject to payment of remaining 
consideration amount of Rs.10,000/- within a period of one month 
and on failure of the deposit of the remaining consideration amount, 
the suit would be deemed to have been dismissed. There is no 
proof/material on record which may suggest that predecessor of the 

Writ Petition No.13531 of 2018. 
-5-
petitioners fulfilled the said condition as it is not established on the 
record at all if such deposit was ever made. Learned trial Court 
cannot enlarge the period for deposit of remaining consideration 
amount under Section 148 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 after 
the lapse of stipulated period of one month. Jurisdiction with the trial 
Court was available only within the stipulated period of one month. 
The moment such period of one month was over, it ceased to have 
jurisdiction and became functus officio, in view of the condition 
incorporated in the decree. In such eventuality the decree passed by 
the learned trial Court could only have been challenged by the 
plaintiff in appeal and the appellate Court was competent to allow an 
application seeking extension of time for deposit of balance sale 
consideration, if justifiable grounds were found. For reference, the 
reliance is placed upon the case law titled as “Muhammad Wahid 
and another versus Nasrullah and another” (2016 SCMR 179) 
7. 
 
Now the question arises whether decrees of specific 
performance can be implemented in the revenue record directly 
through mutation or it can be enforced only through filing execution 
petition?  Learned counsel for the petitioners emphasized that a 
decree of Civil Court still exists in favour of the predecessor of the 
petitioners and the Revenue Officer is duty bound to incorporate said 
decree in the revenue record, through sanctioning of mutation 
irrespective of any delay. 
8. 
 
No doubt, the decree granted by the Civil Court is 
binding on the Revenue Authorities and they are bound by the law to 

Writ Petition No.13531 of 2018. 
-6-
give effect the decree and change entries in the revenue record in 
accordance with the rights of the parties as determined by the Civil 
Court and a decree does not lose its utility for not having been 
effected within the period of limitation. For reference reliance is 
placed upon the case law titled as “ALI AHMAD  and another versus 
MUHAMMAD FAZAL and another” (1972 SCMR 322) 
9. 
 
Section 42(I) of the West Pakistan Land Revenue Act, 
1967 provides that process of mutation would start from a time when 
a transaction of transfer of right in the property has been effected. 
Such acquisition of right in the estate should be as land owner either 
through inheritance, purchase, mortgage, gift or otherwise such as 
decree of Civil Court or as a tenant for a fixed term exceeding one 
year. But such acquisition of right must be with regard to either 
ownership right or tenancy right. 
10. 
 
The decree for specific performance by itself does not 
transfer the title. A decree for specific performance of an agreement 
with regard to sale of the property only declares the right of decree-
holder to have the property transferred in his favour covered by the 
decree and so long as the sale deed is not executed in his favour by 
the judgment-debtor or by the Court, the title of the property remains 
vested in the judgment-debtor. Unless the title in the immovable 
property is transferred by means of a registered sale deed, it cannot 
be deemed to have been transferred irrespective of the fact that an 
agreement to sell has been executed and a decree for its specific 
performance has also been passed. The purpose of the decree of 

Writ Petition No.13531 of 2018. 
-7-
specific performance is to get the sale deed executed and procure 
possession in accordance with the conditions mentioned therein, in 
so long as the sale deed is not executed in favour of the decree-
holder either by the judgment-debtor or by the Court, the title in the 
property vested in the judgment-debtor. For reference the reliance is 
placed upon the case law titled as “Hakim Enayat Ullah v. Khalil 
Ullah Khan and another” (AIR 1938 All 438). Reference may also 
be made with advantage to four other decided cases of this Court 
titled “Majid v. Nizam Din and others” (PLD 1959 Lahore 273), 
“Haji Abdul Rehman and others v. Noor Ahmad and others” (PLD 
1974 BJ 25), “Muhammad Ishaq v. Muhamamd Siddique” (PLD 
1979 Lahore 909) and “Syed Manzoor Hussain Shah v. Khurshid 
Ahmad and 4 others” (1989 CLC 1372). 
11. 
 
In order to get title of the property on the basis of a 
decree for specific performance, the decree holder has to file an 
execution petition through invoking provision of Order XXI Rule 32 
of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, which deals with decrees for 
specific performance, restitution of conjugal rights and injunction. It 
provides various modes and steps for execution of said types of 
decree. By executing the decree for specific performance not only a 
sale deed is executed in favour of decree-holder but the possession is 
delivered as well subject to conditions as mentioned in the 
agreement/decree. The decree for specific performance enjoins the 
parties to perform their part of agreement and on their failure to do 
so, Court itself performs those obligations by carrying out the act 

Writ Petition No.13531 of 2018. 
-8-
required to be done. Said power is conferred under sub-rule 5 of 
Rule 32 of Order XXI, C.P.C. which runs as follows: - 
“Where a decree for specific performance of a contract or for 
an injunction has not been obeyed, the Court may, in lieu of 
or in addition to all or any of the process aforesaid, direct 
that the act required to be done may be done so far as 
practicable by the decree-holder or some other person 
appointed by the Court, at the cost of the judgment-debtor, 
and upon the act being done the expenses incurred may be 
ascertained in such manner as the Court may direct and may 
be recovered as if they were included in the decree.” 
 
12. 
 
In view of the above discussion, this Court has reached 
to a conclusion that a decree for specific performance cannot be 
directly implemented in the revenue record without indulgence of the 
executing Court, who in execution of the decree shall get execute 
sale deed in favour of the decree-holder and deliver the possession in 
accordance with the agreement/decree. Of course, after execution of 
sale deed, the revenue authorities would be bound to give its effect in 
the revenue record. 
13. 
 
For the foregoing reasons, respondent No.1 has rightly 
accepted the revision filed by respondents No.5 to 12 and restored 
the orders dated 28.01.2016 & 25.09.2014. Impugned order is well-
reasoned, justified and passed in accordance with law which does not 
call for any interference by this Court while exercising constitutional 
jurisdiction.  
14. 
 
Learned counsel for the petitioners failed to point out 
any illegality, material irregularity and jurisdictional defect in the 
findings of order passed by respondent No.1. In absence of a 
jurisdictional defect or illegality and irregularity or unless a case of 

Writ Petition No.13531 of 2018. 
-9-
grave miscarriage of justice was made out, this Court in exercise of 
its constitutional jurisdiction, normally did not interfere in the 
findings. I have seen no illegality, infirmity and jurisdictional defect 
in the impugned order.  
15. 
 
Epitome of above discussion is that the instant petition 
is misconceived and not maintainable, hence, the same is hereby, 
dismissed. No order as to costs.
