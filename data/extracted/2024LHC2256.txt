Date of Hearing: 
18.04.2024 
Petitioner by: 
Mr. Arshad Ali Chohan, Advocate. 
Respondents 
No.3 
and 4 by: 
Ch. Tanveer Ahmad Hajra, Advocate. 
Rana Muhammad Arif, Advocate.  
       Anwaar Hussain, J.  Through this petition, under Article 199 of 
the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the 
petitioner-defendant in a suit for specific performance of agreement to 
sell, has called into question orders dated 12.10.2023 and 16.01.2024, 
passed by the Trial Court and the Revisional Court below, respectively, 
whereby the application of respondents No.3 and 4 (“the 
respondents”) to produce the secondary evidence was allowed.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the impugned 
orders are illegal and unlawful as the Courts below failed to advert to  
the condition precedent contained in  Article 76 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984 (“the QSO”) relating to seeking  permission for 
leading secondary evidence, which was never adhered to. Adds that 
neither notice to produce the document(s) under Article 77 of the QSO 
nor notice to admit or deny the document(s) in terms of Order XII of 
the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (“CPC”) was given to the petitioner, 
therefore, the impugned orders are not sustainable. 
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondents submit that, 
even though an application under Article 76 of the QSO is not 
mandatory, however, the same had been filed as an abundant caution 

2 
W.P. No.11458 of 2024 
 
 
by the respondents. Add that in order to produce the counsel who 
issued the document in question (“the legal notice”), the 
respondents/plaintiffs were not required and/or obligated to put the 
petitioner/defendant on notice and to establish that the original was not 
available, hence, the Revisional Court has correctly passed the 
impugned order, which is supported by cogent reasons. Further 
contends that the respondents have already mentioned the contents of 
the legal notice in Paragraph No.5 of the plaint and thereafter in the 
application seeking permission to lead secondary evidence, alongwith 
the name of the counsel who issued the same and, have also appended 
the copies of the postal receipts with the plaint, therefore, no notice was 
required to be served on the petitioner/defendant in terms of Article 77 
of the QSO.  
4. 
In rebuttal, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the 
application of the respondent was premature and unless the respondents 
produce the counsel who issued the legal notice, alongwith original 
postal receipts, the application, which is mandatory for leading 
secondary evidence, cannot be filed let alone entertained and allowed 
through impugned orders.    
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
6. 
This Court is called upon to render its findings in respect of the 
following legal questions: 
i. 
Whether a litigant can be permitted to lead 
secondary evidence, as a matter of right, 
without the leave of the Court and is not 
required to submit an application seeking such 
permission from the Trial Court?  
ii. 
At which stage of the proceedings a litigant 
can apply for leading secondary evidence and 
whether in the facts and circumstances of     
the  case,  the  Courts  below  were  justified in  

3 
W.P. No.11458 of 2024 
 
 
 
allowing 
the 
application 
filed 
by 
the 
respondents?  
7. 
Before answering the legal question, it will be appropriate to 
examine the law of evidence on the subject. During the course of a civil 
trial, it is cardinal principle that he who asserts a fact must prove the 
same, which is based on latin maxim “onus probandi actori incumbit”. 
Mode of proof is the procedure by which the “facts in issue” as also 
“the relevant facts” have to be proved during the trial. Articles 70-89 of 
the QSO contemplate the applicable rules. The general rule is that a 
document is to be proved through primary evidence as envisaged in 
Article 75 of the QSO. The said provision of law obligates that the 
contents of document must be proved by, bringing on record, primary 
evidence except the cases provided in the succeeding provisions. 
Article 74 of the QSO defines the term secondary evidence by 
providing that secondary evidence, inter alia, includes certified copies, 
copies made from original by mechanical process, copies made from or 
compared with the original or oral accounts of the contents of a 
document whereas Article 76 of the QSO contemplates that secondary 
evidence may be given of the existence, condition or contents of a 
document in certain cases provided in the said provision of law. 
Legislative scheme envisaged under the QSO is accommodative of the 
situations where a litigant is handicapped and/or unable to lead primary 
evidence for reasons beyond his control, means or capacity and thus can 
have recourse to Article 76 of the QSO and the circumstances referred 
thereunder appear to circumscribe letting secondary evidence. It is, 
inter alia, in the absence or incapacity of a party, to a lis, giving 
evidence to tender primary evidence in the circumstances referred to 
under the provisions of Article 76 of the QSO that right of a party to 
lead secondary evidence in respect of the document would occasion. 
This right of a litigant would accrue only in the cases or circumstances 

4 
W.P. No.11458 of 2024 
 
 
referred to under clauses (a) to (i) of Article 76 of the QSO. The Court 
seized with the matter is competent to determine whether sufficient 
grounds have been made out or not for the admission of secondary 
evidence, which power is to be exercised by the Court keeping in view 
the parameters and dynamics laid down in Article 76 and the facts and 
circumstances of each case as secondary evidence is given to prove the 
existence, condition, or contents of the document and nothing more 
beyond that. In terms of Article 77 of the QSO, secondary evidence of 
the contents of a document shall not be allowed unless the party 
proposing to give such secondary evidence is previously given, to the 
party in whose possession or power the document is or to his advocate, 
such notice to produce it as prescribed by the law. For the purpose of 
present controversy, it is clause (a) of Article 76 of the QSO read with 
Article 77 thereof, which are relevant and are reproduced hereunder:  
 “76. Cases in which secondary evidence relating to 
documents may be given. Secondary evidence may be 
given of the existence, condition or contents of a 
document in the following cases:- 
 (a)  When the original is shown or appears to be in the 
possession or power of the person against whom the 
document is sought to be proved, or of any person out 
of reach of, or not subject to, the process of the Court; or 
of any person legally bound to produce it; and when, 
after the notice mentioned in Article 77, such person 
does not produce it; 
 (b)……. 
      …… 
In cases (a), (c), (d) and (e), any secondary evidence of 
the contents of the documents is admissible.  
 77. Rules as to notice to produce. Secondary evidence 
of the contents of the documents referred to in Article 
76, paragraph (a), shall not be given unless the party 
proposing to give such secondary evidence has 

5 
W.P. No.11458 of 2024 
 
 
previously given to the party in whose possession or 
power the document is, or to his advocate such notice 
to produce it as is prescribed by law; and if no notice is 
prescribed by law, then such notice as the Court 
considers reasonable under the circumstances of the 
case. 
       Provided that such notice shall not be required in 
order to render secondary evidence admissible in any 
of the following cases, or in any other case in which the 
Court thinks fit to dispense with it:-  
(1) When the document to be proved is itself a 
notice;       
(2) When, from the nature of the case, the adverse 
party must know that he will be required to 
produce it; 
(Emphasis provided)  
Clause (a) of Article 76 provides that when the original is shown or 
appears to be in the possession or power of the person against whom 
the document is sought to be proved and when after the notice 
mentioned in Article 77 such person does not produce it, the litigant 
has a right to lead the secondary evidence. However, clause (1) of the 
proviso to Article 77 lays down that such notice is not required to be 
served when the document to be proved is itself a notice. Similarly, 
clause (2) of the proviso to Article 77 is also attracted in the present 
case as the petitioner/defendant from the nature of the case knew that 
he will be required to produce the legal notice although the 
petitioner/defendant denied the receipt thereof.  
8. 
Having above elucidation qua relevant legal provisions in sight, 
the legal questions formulated hereinabove are to be answered. It is 
imperative to observe that although there is tendency as well as 
prevalent practice of the litigants to file an application for leading 
secondary evidence, it is always open to a party to lead secondary 
evidence before the Trial Court, without filing any application for the 

6 
W.P. No.11458 of 2024 
 
 
reason that upon filing of any such application, one of the two course 
of actions are adopted by the Courts; either the secondary evidence is 
not considered or the evidence is considered twice, once for the 
purpose of “seeking leave/permission of the Court” and then again at 
the time of admitting the document. In first eventuality, there is 
possibility of losing an important piece of evidence if the application 
is dismissed and no appeal is filed and in case of the latter, precious 
time of the Court is wasted and it achieves nothing. Therefore, the 
party intending to produce secondary evidence may produce it at the 
time of recording of evidence, which the opposing party may object to 
at that time and the Court may decide the objection then and there or 
the Court may let it be recorded under objection and decide it at the 
time of final adjudication of the lis i.e., at the time of passing the 
judgment and decree.  
9. 
It is also to be kept in sight that when a trial is initiated, a 
litigant may have primary evidence of some documents, and 
secondary evidence of few others. It is for the litigant to decide which 
of these documents he can best prove and by what evidence. In terms 
of clause (a) of Article 76, a notice is required to given to the other 
side to produce an original document in terms of Article 77 but said 
provision of law also contains certain exceptions as well. One of these 
exception is envisaged in sub-clause (1) which contemplates that no 
notice is required “when the documents to be proved is itself a 
notice”-the legal notice in instant case, or “when, from the nature of 
the case, the adverse party must know that he will be required to 
produce it”, which is also the factual position in the present case. 
Therefore, it is not in every case that a notice under Article 77 is 
compulsory and no “leave or permission” is required from the Court to 
lead secondary evidence. While leading evidence, in terms of Order 
XVIII, CPC, a witness may state that a given document cannot be 
proved by direct evidence and then proceed to adduce the secondary 

7 
W.P. No.11458 of 2024 
 
 
evidence in compliance with Article 76 of the QSO and the Trial 
Court is to consider that evidence, viz., the reason given for not 
leading the primary evidence and the secondary evidence led and then 
decide as to whether the secondary evidence led is sufficient and 
fulfills the mandatory requirements of  Article 76 read with Article 77 
of the QSO.  However, the party, to a lis, may choose to file an 
application seeking permission to lead secondary evidence, which is 
required to be considered by the Trial Court but the Court cannot insist 
on filing of an application for any such permission particularly, if a 
party to the suit has laid foundations of leading secondary evidence, 
either in the pleadings or while leading the evidence. The secondary 
evidence cannot be ousted for consideration only because an 
application for permission to lead secondary evidence was not filed.  
10. 
In view of the preceding discussion, this Court is of the opinion 
that a party may furnish secondary evidence and filing of an 
application seeking permission to lead secondary evidence would not 
be mandatory in every case. However, an application for leading 
secondary evidence by a party is not precluded. Suffice to observe that 
since filing of a formal application for leading secondary evidence is 
not mandatory, the stage at which such an application is filed becomes 
irrelevant.  
11. 
In present case, the respondents filed the application for the 
reason that the legal notice issued by their counsel, duly referred (by 
name) in the plaint of their suit and copies of postal receipts have also 
been appended with the plaint of the suit instituted by the respondents 
and the petitioner/defendant has denied the same, therefore, the 
respondents be allowed to lead secondary evidence of the legal notice. 
After taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case 
in hand, the Revisional Court below has correctly upheld the decision 
of the Trial Court, with independent and cogent reasons. Operative 

8 
W.P. No.11458 of 2024 
 
 
part of the impugned order dated 16.01.2024 passed by the Revisional 
Court below reads as under:  
 
“8. 
Having examined the list U/O 7 rule 14 
CPC, it reveal that in the first column the respondents 
disclosed as many as six documents which were 
appended with the plaint. ……….. Column No.1 of the 
list is very pertinent as it earnestly discloses the intention 
of the respondents and merely six documents have been 
disclosed to be attached with the plaint. It mentions at 
Sr. No.5 that photocopy of legal notice issued to the 
defendant has been annexed alongwith original receipts 
for dispatch of registered covered envelopes of the legal 
notice. The intention of the respondents was quite 
manifest from day one. More particularly, when the 
petitioner being defendant in the suit has already 
denied the receipt of the legal notice for which the 
original receipts of postal service are also available with 
the respondents. The respondents should have the fair 
opportunity to prove their stance in the shape of 
secondary evidence and necessary permission was 
sought by the learned trial court.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
This Court endorses the opinion of the Courts below. The respondents 
made out a prima facie case to lead secondary evidence and the prior 
notice in terms of Article 77 of the QSO was not required as envisaged 
under clause (1) thereof as the document intended to be produced itself 
is a notice. Cases reported as “Muhammad Khan and 9 others v. 
Ameer Khan Gaddi Balloch” (2008 YLR 296); “Altaf Hussain Shah 
and another v. Abdul Qadeer and 2 others” (PLJ 2004 Lahore 579) 
and “Liaqat Ali v. Muzaffar Khan and another” (2003 YLR 1899) are 
referred in this regard. Needless to observe that mere admission of a 
document in evidence and making exhibit thereof does not prove it 
automatically and/or does not attest to its authenticity, truthfulness or 
genuineness, which will have to be established during the course of 
the trial, in accordance with law.

In view of the above discussion, the present constitutional 
petition has no merits, hence, the same is dismissed. No order as to 
costs.
