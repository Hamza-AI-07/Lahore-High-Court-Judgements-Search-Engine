The motive behind the occurrence was that one year before the 
occurrence the accused persons committed theft of a dog valuing 
Rs.10,00,000/- regarding which a criminal case was got lodged by us at 
p/s Budhlasant, Multan. Due to the above revenge on 14th August, 2015 
the accused persons made fires while coming to my home on which my 
Behnoi Muhammad Saeed Javaid  son of Muhammad Shakoor received 
the fires. I and my cousin Ghulam Hussain also received fires. The above 
said incident was also reported to the police. Due to this grudge the 
accused persons committed the occurrence with intention to kill my 
brother Abid Hussain. 
 
 
Apart from me this occurrence was witnessesed by Muhammad 
Ashraf son of Muhammad Yousaf. We made a call on 1122 rescue and 
also made call on 15-police rescue. I alongwith Muhammad Ashraf 
escorted my brother Abid Hussain on my motorcycle and went to

Multan and reached at Emergency Ward and Abid Hussin got admitted 
there. Ghulam Mustafa, ASI alongwith other police officials came at 
Nishtar Hopsital, Multan. I narrated the occurrence to Ghulam Mustafa, 
ASI who drafted the complaint Ex-PA and my signature over it is Ex-
PA/1. On 22.02.2016 my brother Abid Hussain died at about 5:55 a.m. I 
made a call to Ghulam Mustafa. ASI and informed him about the death of 
my brother. My supplementary statement was recorded by the police in 
this regard. My brother Sajid Hussain and my Behnoi Saeed Ahmad also 
witnessed the occurrence who reached at the spot. After the post mortem 
examination of deceased I received the dead body from Nishtar Hospital, 
Multan after giving its receipt Ex-PB. My other statement was recorded by 
the police in which I narrated that leg of my brother was taken away by 
Umerdraz alias Drazi ete while brandishing, on which the offence u/s 7-
ATA was added. 
 
 
Police made a raid for the arrest of the accused persons in my 
presence and when we reached at the house of Umerdraz, a chopped leg of 
my brother was recovered from the house of Umerdraz. Police prepared 
Fard identification of chopped right leg wearing black colour sock and 
Jogger Ex-PC. I put my signature over it. DNA test of Chopped leg was 
conducted and I received the same after the test while giving its receipt 
Ex-PD. Identification parade regarding one unknown accused was 
conducted in jail. I identified Muhammad Amjid son of Muhammad 
Ramzan during identification. Regarding this occurrence news was 
telecasted at Samma T.V. Channel and I downloaded the same in USB and 
was produced by me to the police, which was made a part of police file 
through recovery memo Ex-PE, attested by me. 
 
 
During investigation in connivance of the police with the accused 
my case was destroyed and the police declared accused Qaswar alias 
Puppi who chopped the leg of my deceased brother innocent. I submitted 
many application before the High-ups of the police but in vain so I filed a

Muhammad Ashraf alias Kaloo on 22.02.2016 and detailed the facts of the 
investigation as conducted by him in his statement before the learned trial court.  
 
8.    
On 27.10.2018, the learned counsel for the complainant gave up the 
witnesses namely Muhammad Amjad, Sajid Hussain, Muhammad Naveed and 
Muhammad Javed as being unnecessary. On 20.02.2019, the learned Deputy 
District Public Prosecutor gave up the prosecution witnesses, namely Muhammad 
Arshad 1982/C and Ameer Hassan, SI as being unnecessary. On 10.04.2019, the 
learned counsel for the complainant closed the evidence of the complainant after 
submitting photocopies of expiry notes and ward report (Mark-1, Mark-2 and 
Mark-3). On 10.04.2019, the learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor tendered in 
evidence the reports of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PTT, 
Exh.PUU and Exh. PVV). 
 
9. 
After the closure of prosecution evidence, the learned trial court examined 
the appellants namely Irfan alias Punna son of Umar Daraz alias Dazi and 
Muhammad Ashraf alias Kaloo son of Muhammad Asghar under section 342 
Cr.P.C. and in answer to question why this case against you and why the P.W.s 
have deposed against you, they replied that they were innocent and had been 
falsely involved in the case. Irfan alias Punna son of Umar Daraz alias Dazi and 
Muhammad Ashraf alias Kaloo son of Muhammad Asghar further stated that they 
had not committed any offence and had been made a scapegoat in the case in order 
to show efficiency by the police. The appellants namely Irfan alias Punna son of 
Umar Daraz alias Dazi and Muhammad Ashraf alias Kaloo son of Muhammad 

Murder Reference No.64 of 2018

Asghar opted not to get themselves  examined under section 340(2) Cr.P.C , 
however, the appellant namely Irfan alias Punna son of Umar Daraz alias Dazi 
produced documents (Exh.D/1 to Exh.D/6) as evidence in his defence. 
 
10. 
At the conclusion of the trial, the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Multan 
convicted and sentenced the appellant as referred to above.   
 
11.        The contention of the learned counsel for the appellants namely Irfan alias 
Punna son of Umar Daraz alias Dazi and Muhammad Ashraf alias Kaloo son of 
Muhammad Asghar precisely is that the whole case is fabricated and false and the 
prosecution remained unable to prove the facts in issue and did not produce any 
unimpeachable, admissible, and relevant evidence. Learned counsel for the 
appellants further contended that the story of the prosecution mentioned in the 
statements of the witnesses, on the face of it, was highly improbable. Learned 
counsel for the appellants further contended that the statements of the prosecution 
witnesses were not worthy of any reliance. The learned counsel for the appellants 
also submitted that the recovery of the Repeater gun (P-5) and the Toka (P-6)  from 
the appellant namely Irfan alias Punna son of Umar Daraz alias Dazi and the 
recovery of the Repeater gun and the motorcycle (P-10) from the appellant namely  
Muhammad Ashraf alias Kaloo son of Muhammad Asghar were full of procedural 
defects, of no legal worth and value, and were result of fake proceedings. The 
learned counsel for the appellants also argued that the appellants had been involved 
in the occurrence only on suspicion. The learned counsel for the appellants finally 
submitted that the prosecution had totally failed to prove the case against the 
accused beyond the shadow of a doubt.

11. 
On the other hand, the learned Additional Prosecutor General  along with the 
learned counsel for the complainant, contended that the prosecution had proved its 
case beyond the shadow of doubt by producing independent witnesses. The learned 
Additional Prosecutor General along with the learned counsel for the complainant, 
further argued that the deceased died as a result of injuries suffered at the hands of 
the appellants. The learned Additional Prosecutor General along with the learned 
counsel for the complainant, further contended that the medical evidence also 
corroborated the statements of the eye witnesses. The learned Additional 
Prosecutor General along with the learned counsel for the complainant, further 
argued that the recovery of the Repeater gun (P-5) and the Toka (P-6)  from the 
appellant namely Irfan alias Punna son of Umar Daraz alias Dazi and the recovery 
of the Repeater gun and the motorcycle (P-10) from the appellant namely 
Muhammad Ashraf alias Kaloo son of Muhammad Asghar also corroborated the 
ocular account. The learned Additional Prosecutor General along with the learned 
counsel for the complainant, further contended that there was no occasion for the 
prosecution witnesses, who were related to the deceased, to substitute the real 
offenders with the innocent in this case. Lastly, the learned Additional Prosecutor 
General along with the learned counsel for the complainant prayed for the rejection 
of the appeal as lodged by the appellants namely Irfan alias Punna son of Umar 
Daraz alias Dazi and Muhammad Ashraf alias Kaloo son of Muhammad Asghar. 
The learned counsel for the complainant also argued that the Criminal Appeal 
No.674 of 2019, assailing the acquittal of Qaswar Hussain alias Pappi, Umar Daraz 
alias Dazi, Shahid Hussain and Amjad by the learned trial court from the charges 
also merited acceptance.

We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant, the learned counsel for 
the complainant, the learned Additional Prosecutor General and with their 
assistance carefully perused the record and evidence recorded during the trial. 
13.    A perusal of the prosecution evidence reveals that the whole prosecution case 
as against the appellants is based on the statements of the prosecution witnesses 
namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad 
Saeed Javed (PW-3). The relationship of the prosecution witnesses namely Khalid 
Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3)  
with the deceased is on record. Muhammad Abid (deceased)  was the brother of the 
prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) and the brother-in-law of the 
prosecution witness namely Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) and the cousin of the 
prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) The prosecution witnesses 
namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad 
Saeed Javed (PW-3) were also admittedly not the residents of the place of 
occurrence. According to the prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-
1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3)  all of them 
had their residences at a distance of about as much as about 6/7 kilometres from 
the place of occurrence. The prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), 
during cross-examination stated as under:- 
“ The inter-se distance between the shop of Abid Husain and my residence is 
05/06 kilometers. The same is the distance between the house of Muhammad 
Ashraf and the shop of Abid Hussain. The inter-se distance between the shop of 
Abid Hussain and place of occurrence is about 1-1/2 kilometer. The house of 
Muhammad Saeed Javaid is 05-acre away from my house as well as the house of 
Muhammad Ashraf” (emphasis supplied)  

Murder Reference No.64 of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 518 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No.674 of 2019 
 
 
13 
 
Similarly, prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) during cross-
examination, stated as under:- 
“ The inter-se distance between my house and the shop of deceased is about 04-
kilometers. The inter-se distance between the place of occurrence and the shop of 
Abid Hussain is about 1-1/2 kilometer.  
…… 
I do not know that how much population of that Basti. The distance between the 
alleged place of occurrence and my house is at about 2-1/2 kilometer” 
In this manner, the prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) can be validly 
termed as “chance witnesses” and therefore were under a bounden duty to provide 
a convincing reason for their presence at the place of occurrence, at the time of 
occurrence and were also under a duty to prove their presence by producing some 
physical proof of the same. We have noted with grave concern that the prosecution 
witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and 
Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) failed miserably to provide any consistent 
evidence as to the reason for their arrival at the place of occurrence and their 
presence at the place of occurrence when the same was taking place. The 
prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) had claimed that it was after 
the closing of the shop of the deceased that he had accompanied the deceased on 
the motorcycle of the deceased for proceeding to their house when they were 
waylaid by the accused. A perusal of the statements of the prosecution witnesses 
namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad 
Saeed Javed (PW-3) reveals that in fact there was no reason for the prosecution

witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) to have gone to the shop of the deceased 
and then to have accompanied him to the place of occurrence. The prosecution 
witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) admitted that it was a routine of the 
deceased that he would go to his shop alone and also return from the same alone. 
The prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) , admitted during cross-
examination , as under:- 
“ In the course of business Abid Hussain deceased  went to his shop alone and he 
also returned from his shop towards alone”  
Being conscious of this practice of the deceased of going to his shop alone, the 
prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) improved upon his previous 
statement and claimed that he had a purpose for going to the shop of the deceased 
on the day of occurrence and the said purpose was to close the same. It has not 
been explained by the prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) that 
why it was only on the day of occurrence that the deceased needed any assistance 
of the prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) to close his shop. Even 
otherwise the said reason is bordering on absurd for the fact that the assistance of 
the prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) was not at all required for 
merely closing the shop, which feat could have been performed by the deceased 
himself, as was it being done earlier by the deceased himself. Furthermore, during 
cross-examination, it was brought on record that the prosecution witness namely 
Khalid Hussain (PW-1) had contrived his reason for arrival at the shop of the 
deceased and had not mentioned the same in his earlier statements. During cross-
examination, the prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), was 
questioned in this regard  and the learned trial court observed as under:- 

Murder Reference No.64 of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 518 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No.674 of 2019

“ Except Sunday Abid Hussain deceased went to his shop with his children but on 
Sunday he went to his shop alone On the day of occurrence, he went to his shop 
alone. I had mentioned in the FIR the reason of my visit to the shop of deceased 
Abid Hussain on the day of occurrence for closing his shop. Confronted with 
Ex-PA and Ex.DB where it is not so mentioned. ”(emphasis supplied)  
In this manner, the prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) impeached 
his own credit by improving his previous statements so as to provide a reason for 
him to have accompanied the deceased on the day of occurrence. Furthermore, 
Ghulam Mustafa, SI (PW-6), the Investigating Officer of the case, also admitted 
during cross-examination that he did not verify the claim of the prosecution 
witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) that he had gone to the shop of the 
deceased to close the same and stated as under:- 
“I have not verified nor collected any evidence that how the complainant was with 
the deceased and from where he was coming ” 
Moreover,  Irshad ul Hassan, Inspector (CW-1), another Investigating Officer of 
the case, also admitted during cross-examination that he did not collect any 
evidence in support of the claim that the prosecution witness namely Khalid 
Hussain (PW-1) had gone to the shop of the deceased and then had accompanied 
the deceased to the place of occurrence and stated as under:- 
“It is correct that there was no one in the city who had stated that he had seen the 
deceased going with the complainant and PWs on the day of occurrence.” 
14. 
A perusal of the evidence of the prosecution recorded during the course of 
the trial also proves that even the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ashraf 
(PW-2) had no reason to have accompanied the deceased from his shop to the 

Murder Reference No.64 of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 518 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No.674 of 2019

place of occurrence, contrary to what was claimed by Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2). 
The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) ,while appearing 
before the learned trial court, stated that as he was working with the deceased, 
therefore, on the day of occurrence, after closing the shop of the deceased, he 
followed the deceased till they were waylaid by the accused. This claim of the 
prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) that he was working with 
the deceased was exposed to be a sham. The prosecution witness namely 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) was questioned in this regard and the learned trial 
court observed as under:- 
“I have recorded in my examination in chief that I do work as a tailor alongwith 
the deceased Abid and I recorded the same fact in my statement under Sec. 161 
Cr. PC. Ex-DF. The witness said that he did not remember that whether he 
recorded this fact in his statement under Séc.161 Cr.P.C., however confronted 
with Ex-DF where it is not so recorded and it is recorded that he works 
labour  
…. 
I have got recorded in my statements Ex-DJ and in Ex-DF that I do work as 
Tailor alongwith Abid Hussain. Confronted with Ex-DJ and Ex-DF where it is 
not recorded. I have got recorded in my statements Ex-DJ and Ex-DF that I was 
working in my shop alongwith Abid deceased when Khalid Hussain son of 
Muhammad Rafique came. Confronted with Ex-DJ and Ex-DF where it is not 
recorded” (emphasis supplied)  
The above referred portion of the cross-examination of the prosecution witness 
namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) conclusively proves that  Muhammad Ashraf 
(PW-2) had no purpose to be present with the deceased prior to the occurrence and 

Murder Reference No.64 of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 518 of 2019

to had followed the deceased to the place of occurrence, contrary to what was 
claimed by him.  
15. 
The case of  the third eye witness as produced by the complainant before the 
learned trial court namely Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) is in itself very unique. 
It was admitted by all the prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) that the 
prosecution witness namely Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) was not mentioned 
as a witness of the occurrence in the oral statement (Exh. PA) of Khalid Hussain 
(PW-1) upon the basis of which the formal F.I.R (Exh. PFF) was recorded. It was 
candidly admitted by all the prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) during their 
statements recorded by the learned trial court. The prosecution witness namely 
Khalid Hussain (PW-1) during cross-examination , admitted as under:- 
“I  have recorded in my examination in chief that my brother Sajid and Behnoi 
Saeed (PW-3) also witnessed the occurrence who reached at the spot. Confronted 
with Ex.DB and Ex.PA where it is not so recorded. 
……………. 
I have not got recorded in my private complaint Ex-PF, which was dictated 
by me to my learned counsel and in complaint Ex-PA that my brother Sajid 
Hussain and my Behnoi Saeed Ahmad also witnessed the occurrence who 
reached at the spot.  
……………………

Criminal Appeal    No. 518 of 2019

18 
 
I have not got recorded in my private complaint Ex-PF and in my statement Ex-
PA that this occurrence is also witnessed by Sajid Hussain and Muhammad Saeed 
Javaid. ” (emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) during cross-
examination, was confronted with his previous statement and the learned trial court 
observed as under:- 
“I have recorded in my examination in chief that during the occurrence Saeed 
Ahmad and Muhammad Sajid also attracted at the spot and witnessed the 
occurrence. Confronted with Ex-DG where it is not so recorded. ” 
Ghulam Mustafa, SI (PW-6), the Investigating Officer of the case who had 
recorded the oral statement (Exh.PA) of Khalid Hussain (PW-1) also admitted 
during cross-examination that the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Saeed 
Javed (PW-3) was not named as a witness by the complainant in the oral statement 
(Exh. PA) and stated as under:- 
“It is correct that Saced PW has not been mentioned in FIR. ” 
The question of the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3)  
having not witnessed the occurrence was conclusively answered when during 
cross-examination,  the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-
3) himself admitted that he had not been cited as an eye witness in the oral 
statement (Exh.PA) of Khalid Hussain (PW-1) upon the basis of which the formal 
F.I.R (Exh. PFF) was recorded and he was not even named as a witness who had 
seen the occurrence in the private complaint (Exh. PF) as filed by the complainant 
Khalid Hussain (PW-1) and  admitted as under:- 

Murder Reference No.64 of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 518 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No.674 of 2019 
 
 
19 
 
“ It is correct that in the complaint Ex-PA, FIR of the instant case and in this 
private complaint Ex-PF I am not cited as an eyewitness by the complainant” 
16.      During the cross-examination, the prosecution witnesses namely Khalid 
Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) 
were badly exposed with regard to that there did not exist any reason for their 
arrival at the place of occurrence, at the time of occurrence. Irshad ul Hassan, 
Inspector (CW-1), another Investigating Officer of the case, admitted during cross-
examination that he did not collect any evidence in support of the claim that the 
prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) 
and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3)  had accompanied the deceased to the place 
of occurrence and stated as under:- 
“It is correct that when Adil Mehmood made the statement in the presence of the 
complainant Adil stated that the deceased left the Tailor Shop alone and the 
complainant and PWs were not with him. It is correct that no evidence or any 
person was produced by the complainant or PWs to prove that they were 
accompanying the deceased and they were present at the place of occurrence. 
Volunteered that only the complainant and PWs stated that they were present at 
the spot. It is correct that there was no one in the city who had stated that he had 
seen the deceased going with the complainant and PWs on the day of occurrence.” 
 The proven failure of the prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3)  to provide a 
reason for their arrival at the place of occurrence, on the day of the incident, has 
repercussions, proving that there was no reason actually for the prosecution 
witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and 
Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3)  to be visiting the place of occurrence. The very 

Murder Reference No.64 of 2018

inception of the prosecution case is thus put in doubt due to the said abject failure 
of the prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf 
(PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3).  
17. 
We have also noted that though it was claimed by the prosecution witnesses 
namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) that they 
had gone to the place of occurrence on two motorcycles whereas the  deceased was 
riding a separate motorcycle with the prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain 
(PW-1), however, during the course of the investigation as well as before the 
learned trial court, the said motorcycles, allegedly used by the prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-
3), to arrive at the place of occurrence, were not produced. The prosecution witness 
namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) during cross-examination admitted that the 
motorcycles used by the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) 
and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3)  to arrive at the place of occurrence were 
never produced before the Investigating Officer of the case and stated as under:- 
“During the whole investigation we have not produced the second 
motorcycle. My clothes were smeared with blood when I took care of my brother. 
The second motorcycle also stained with blood and the same is the case of 
Muhammad Ashraf as his clothes were also smeared with blood. Neither 1 nor 
Muhammad Ashraf produced our blood stained clothes during the course of 
investigation. We also did not produce the second motorcycle which was 
blood stained during the course of investigation ”(emphasis supplied)  
Similarly, the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) admitted 
during cross-examination that the motorcycle used by him to arrive at the place of  

Murder Reference No.64 of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 518 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No.674 of 2019 
 
 
21 
 
occurrence was never produced before the Investigating Officer of the case and 
stated as under:- 
“My motorcycle might be stained with blood but the same was not produced 
before the I.O” 
Ghulam Mustafa, SI (PW-6), the Investigating Officer of the case, also admitted 
during cross-examination that at the time of his arrival at the place of occurrence , 
the motorcycles used by the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ashraf 
(PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) to arrive at the place of occurrence 
were not present there and neither same were produced before him despite his 
demand and admitted as under:- 
“The other two motorcycles were not found present at the place of occurrence. 
Even the complainant and prosecution witnesses had also not produced the other 
two motorcycles inspite of my asking till the investigation remained with me.” 
Even Irshad ul Hassan, Inspector (CW-1), another Investigating Officer of the 
case, admitted during cross-examination that the prosecution witnesses namely 
Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed 
(PW-3)  never produced before him the motorcycles used by them to arrive at the 
place of occurrence and stated as under:- 
“It is correct that the complainant or PWs never produced before me the 
motorcycle on which they were allegedly travelling alongwith deceased nor 
they mentioned the registration numbers of motorcycles. ” (emphasis supplied)  
The non-production and the non-availability of the motorcycles used by the 
prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed 
Javed (PW-3)  to arrive at the place of occurrence and the failure of the prosecution 

Murder Reference No.64 of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 518 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No.674 of 2019 
 
 
22 
 
witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and 
Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) to produce the same before the Investigating 
Officers of the case, despite their repeated demands,  leads to only one conclusion 
and that being that no such motorcycles were available. Had such motorcycles 
been used by the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and 
Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) to arrive at the place of occurrence, then the same 
must have been available at the place of occurrence, at the time of arrival of 
Ghulam Mustafa, SI (PW-6), the Investigating Officer of the case and Irshad ul 
Hassan, Inspector (CW-1) and the same would necessarily have been taken into 
possession by the Investigating Officers of the case but they were not and it proves 
that a false claim was made by the prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain 
(PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) that the 
prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed 
Javed (PW-3)  had arrived at the place of occurrence on two motorcycles. In this 
manner, the prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad 
Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) failed miserably to prove that 
they had indeed arrived at the place of occurrence, at the time when the same was 
happening. Reliance in this regard is placed on the case of “Muhammad Ali Vs. 
The State” (2015 SCMR 137) wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan has 
held as under:- 
“The Investigating Officer during the cross-examination has admitted that the 
'Dala' was not present when he visited the spot and he had not taken into 
possession the said 'Dala' during investigation. So the story introduced by the 
eye-witnesses that they were travelling on the 'Dala' when the incident took place 
is not supported by any connecting material.”

Criminal Appeal    No. 518 of 2019

23 
 
In this manner, the prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) failed miserably 
to establish the reason for their presence at the place of occurrence, at the time of 
occurrence and the mode through which they arrived at the place of occurrence. 
The prosecution was under a bounden duty to establish not only that the 
prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) 
and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) had a reason to proceed to the place of 
occurrence but also to prove the mode through which the prosecution witnesses 
namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad 
Saeed Javed (PW-3) arrived at the place of occurrence. The failure of the 
prosecution to prove the said fact has vitiated our trust in Khalid Hussain (PW-1), 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3)  as being truthful 
witnesses. In this respect, reliance is placed on the case of “Muhammad Rafiq v. 
State” (2014 SCMR 1698) wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan rejected 
the claim of witnesses who lived one kilometer away from the place of occurrence, 
but on the day of occurrence stated to be present near the spot as they were 
working as labourers, inasmuch as they failed to give any detail of the projects they 
were working on. Reliance is also placed on the case of “Usman alias Kaloo v. 
State” (2017 SCMR 622) wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan held that 
the ocular account of the incident had been furnished by Zahoor Ahmad, Ghulam 
Farid and Manzoor Ahmed in the said case who were all residents of some other 
houses and they were not the inmates of the house wherein the occurrence had 
taken place and therefore the said eye-witnesses were, thus,declared chance 
witnesses and not worthy of reliance. Reliance is also placed on the case of 
“Nasrullah alias Nasro v. The State” (2017 SCMR 724).

18. 
     We have also noted that according to the prosecution witnesses namely 
Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed 
(PW-3), the motive of the occurrence was that the prosecution witness namely 
Khalid Hussain (PW-1) had a dog stolen for which theft he got a case registered 
against the appellants and that subsequently an incident of firing had taken place 
between the prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) and the accused, 
in retaliation of which the accused acted on the day of the occurrence. The 
prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) himself admitted that he was 
the main accused named by the complainant of the cross-version case of the F.I.R 
No. 207 of 2015 and the deceased had absolutely no enmity with the accused and 
even in the case of the theft of his dog, the prosecution witness namely Khalid 
Hussain (PW-1) admitted that the deceased was not even named as a witness. The 
prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) admitted during cross-
examination, as under:- 
“ The FIR relating to the motive of the stolen dog, I was the complainant of 
that FIR. It is correct that in FIR No. 221/2015 dated 25.08.2015 Ex.DC I had 
mentioned that I was the owner of the dog. It is correct that in the above said 
FIR name of deceased Abid is not mentioned anywhere. It is correct that a 
cross-version was recorded against me alongwith other PWs regarding the FIR 
No. 207/2015 dated 15.08.2015. It is correct that in the cross-version registered 
against us in the above mentioned FIR, the fire was made by Muhammad Hanif 
with 12-bore weapon to the accused Muhammad Qaswar which hit on the 
backside of the accused Muhammad Qaswar. It is correct that in FIR No. 
207/2015 my father was the complainant. It is correct that in the cross-version 
registered against us Ex.DE I alongwith my father Muhammad Rafique, Abid 
deceased and Muhammad Hanif were the accused persons. It is correct that I 

Murder Reference No.64 of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 518 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No.674 of 2019 
 
 
25 
 
alongwith Muhammad Hanif were the main accused in that cross-version. It 
is correct that in the above said case, no overt role was attributed to the 
accused (deceased) Abid Hussain.” (emphasis supplied)  
In these circumstances, the prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) 
should have been the prime target of the assailants. Furthermore, according to the 
prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) 
and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3), the prosecution witness namely Khalid 
Hussain (PW-1)  was in clear view, at a meagre distance, from the assailants and 
unarmed whereas the accused were allegedly armed with various firearm and other 
weapons. Neither there was any dearth of ammunition nor that of intent and 
opportunity on the part of the appellants or their co-accused for not doing away 
with the prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), who, according to his 
own statement, was the main adversary of the accused and who, at the time of 
occurrence,  was present at the place of occurrence and there did not exist any 
obstacle in the line of the sight of the accused and the place where the prosecution 
witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) was present. In this situation, it is hard to 
believe that the prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) would have 
been shown the courtesy of being not fired at all when Khalid Hussain (PW-1)  
should have been the prime target of the assailants. In the midst of the firing by the 
accused persons, the prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) did not 
receive even a single scratch on his body during the whole occurrence nor was 
even targeted at all. The prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) 
claimed during cross-examination as under:- 

Murder Reference No.64 of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 518 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No.674 of 2019 
 
 
26 
 
“It is correct that although the motive is against me but at the time of occurrence 
none of the accused persons even touched me nor they even touched of any 
PWs. 
…………… 
It is correct that the FIR relating to the dog I was the complainant and stated in the 
said I that the said pet dog belongs to me. It is correct that during the whole 
occurrence none of us including me had received even a single scratch”. 
(emphasis supplied)   
If the prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) had been present in the 
view of the assailants, then he would not have been spared. Blessing the 
prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) with such incredible 
consideration and showing him such favour, the person with whom the assailants 
had a direct dispute with, is implausible and opposed to the natural behaviour of 
any accused. It is all the more illogical that being perceptive of the fact that if the 
witnesses were left alive, they would depose against the accused, even then the 
appellants and their co-accused did not cause any injury to them. Such behaviour, 
on the part of the accused as deposed by the prosecution witnesses namely Khalid 
Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3)  
runs counter to natural human conduct and behaviour. Article 129 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984 allows the courts to presume the existence of any fact, which 
it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of 
natural events and human conduct in relation to the facts of the particular case. We 
thus trust the existence of this fact, by virtue of the Article 129 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984, that the conduct of the assailants, as deposed to by the 
prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) 

Murder Reference No.64 of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 518 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No.674 of 2019 
 
 
27 
 
and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) was opposed to the common course of 
natural events and human conduct. Hence, we are holding that the prosecution 
witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and 
Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) did not witness the occurrence. The august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in its binding judgments has repeatedly held that in a 
scenario where the motivation was against the complainant or the witnesses but the 
accused did not cause any harm to them, notwithstanding being within the range of 
their firing, would reveal that the said witnesses had not witnessed the occurrence. 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case Tariq Mehmood v. The State and 
others (2019 SCMR 1170) has observed as under: 
“First sight cannot escape preponderance of evidence, however on a closer view, 
emerges a picture incompatible with the events, narrated in the crime report. The 
accused mounted assault, as per prosecution's own case to settle score with 
Muhammad Usman, PW for his alleged affair with the lady related to the 
appellant; it is disgrace that brought the assailants, face to face, with Muhammad 
Usman, PW, well within their view and reach it is astonishing that while being 
merciless without restraint upon others they spared prime target of assault. There 
can be no other inference that either Muhammad Usman was not present at the 
scene or the occurrence took place in a backdrop other than asserted in the crime 
report.” 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in case Rohtas Khan v. The State (2010 
SCMR 566) at page 571 observed as under: 
“The alleged motive was against the complainant, but it is noted that the 
appellant did not cause any injury to the complainant, though he was present 
within the range of firing, thus it supports the contention of the learned counsel of 
appellant that P.Ws. were not present at the place of occurrence.”  
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Muhammad Farooq & 
another v. The State (2006 SCMR 1707) at page 1712 held as under:- 

Murder Reference No.64 of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 518 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No.674 of 2019 
 
 
28 
 
“Had P.W.9 been present on the spot, he was not likely to be spared because the 
number of injuries on the person of deceased show that at least eighteen rounds 
were fired. It only shows the degree of venom the killer had for the deceased.” 
We are also guided by the binding judgment of the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan passed in the case of Mst. Rukhsana Begum & others v. Sajjad & others 
(2017 SCMR 596) where at page 601 it was observed as under:- 
“Another intriguing aspect of the matter is that, according to the F.I.R., all the 
accused encircled the complainant, the PWs and the two deceased thus, the 
apparent object was that none could escape alive. The complainant being father 
of the two deceased and the head of the family was supposed to be the prime 
target. In fact he has vigorously pursued the case against the accused and also 
deposed against them as an eye witness. The site plan positions would show that, 
he and the other P.W.s were at the mercy of the assailants but being the prime 
target even no threat was extended to him. Blessing him with unbelievable 
courtesy and mercy shown to him by the accused knowing well that he and the 
witnesses would depose against them by leaving them unhurt, is absolutely 
unbelievable story. Such behavior, on the part of the accused runs counter to 
natural human conduct and behavior explained in the provision of Article 129 of 
the Qanun-e-Shahadat, Order 1984, therefore, the court is unable to accept such 
unbelievable proposition.” 
 
19.      We have also noted with grave concern that despite the fact that repeated 
blows were made with a sharp edged weapon to cut the lower part of the right leg 
of the deceased, however, the prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-
1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) made 
contradictory statements with regard to the identity of the accused who had cut off 
the said leg of the deceased. According to the Dr. Liaquat Ali Ansari, (PW-8), at 
the time of the post-mortem examination of the dead body, he had observed that 
the right leg of the dead body was cut below the knee joint and there were multiple 
chopped wounds present. As mentioned above, it must have taken some time for 
the accused to inflict the said multiple blows and according to the claim of the 
prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2)

and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3), it was all done in their presence, however, 
still the prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf 
(PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) made contradictory statements with 
regard to the identity of the accused who had inflicted the said multiple blows, 
chopping off the right leg of the deceased under the knee. According to the 
prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) it was Qaswar Hussain alias 
Pappi (accused since acquitted) who had inflicted the said blows and Khalid 
Hussain (PW-1) in his statement before the learned trial court stated as under:- 
“Qaswar alias Buppi son of Muhammad Asghar with his Toka chopped the 
leg of Abid Hussain below the knee ” (emphasis supplied)  
Contradicting the prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) that it was 
Qaswar Hussain alias Pappi (accused since acquitted) who had inflicted the said 
blows, the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) in his statement 
before the learned trial court stated that it was Umar Daraz alias Dazi (accused 
since acquitted) who had chopped off  the right leg of the deceased from under the 
knee. The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2), in his statement 
before the learned trial court, stated as under:- 
“Umerdraz with the help of his Toka chopped the right leg of deceased under 
the knee.” (emphasis supplied)  
This contradiction in the statements of the prosecution witnesses namely Khalid 
Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) 
regarding the identity of the accused who had chopped off the right leg of the 
deceased from under the knee also proves that the prosecution witnesses namely 
Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed

(PW-3) had not witnessed the occurrence and therefore made such contradictory 
statements.  
20.      We have also noted that the prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain 
(PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) claimed 
that their clothes were smeared with the blood of the deceased, however at the 
same time also admitted that they did not hand over the said clothes to the 
Investigating Officer of the case. The prosecution witness namely  Khalid Hussain 
(PW-1), during cross-examination, stated as under:- 
“My clothes became blood stained during the rescue of Abid Hussain in injured 
condition but I had not produced my blood stained clothes to the I.O.  
………. 
 Neither I nor Muhammad Ashraf produced our blood stained clothes during 
the course of investigation.”(emphasis supplied)  
Similarly the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) also 
admitted during cross- examination as under:- 
“The clothes of mine and complainant were stained with blood but the same were 
not produced before the I.O.” 
Ghulam Mustafa, SI (PW-6), the Investigating Officer of the case and Irshad ul 
Hassan, Inspector (CW-1), the other Investigating Officer of the case did not take 
any such blood-stained clothes of the prosecution witnesses namely Khalid 
Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) 
into possession which lays bare the untruthful and false claim of the prosecution 
witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and 

Murder Reference No.64 of 2018

Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) to have been present at the place of occurrence, 
at the time of occurrence and having their clothes stained with the blood of the 
deceased. Ghulam Mustafa, SI (PW-6), the Investigating Officer of the case 
admitted during cross- examination as under:- 
“It is correct that PWs including the complainant never showed their dresses if it 
was stained with blood of the deceased.” 
Irshad ul Hassan, Inspector (CW-1), the other Investigating Officer of the case, 
admitted during cross- examination that the prosecution witnesses namely Khalid 
Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) 
failed to provide their clothes as worn by them on the day of occurrence, allegedly 
stained with blood, as  proof of their presence and stated  as under:- 
“Complaiannt  (sic) or PWs had not stated before me nor they produced any blood 
stained clothes of theirs to prove that their hands or clothes got blood stained 
when they were shifting the injured to the ambulance 1122 to the hospital.” 
Moreover, if Ghulam Mustafa, SI (PW-6), the Investigating Officer of the case and 
Irshad ul Hassan, Inspector (CW-1), the other Investigating Officer of the case had 
taken the clothes of the prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3), which clothes 
according to the prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) were stained 
with blood, into possession and if these were sent to the Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore for examination and grouping with that of the blood-stained 
clothes of the deceased, the same would have provided the strongest corroboration 
to the testimony of the prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1),

Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3), but now the 
omission creates a doubt of equal magnitude.  This omission strikes at the roots of 
the case of the prosecution and lays bare the untruthful and false claim of the 
prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) 
and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) to have been present at the place of 
occurrence, at the time of occurrence. Guidance is sought from the principle 
enunciated by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Mst. SUGHRA 
BEGUM and another versus QAISER PERVEZ and others (2015 S C M R 1142) 
wherein it has been held as under:- 
“20.       Both the eye-witnesses admitted that their clothes were stained 
with the blood of the deceased while lifting and handling him but the 
investigating officer, otherwise showing extraordinary interest in the case, 
did not take the same into possession because if these were sent to the 
Chemical Examiner for examination and grouping with that of the blood 
stained clothes of the deceased, the same would have provided strongest 
corroboration to the testimony of the two eye-witnesses. This omission 
strikes at the roots of the case of the prosecution and bespeaks volumes 
about the dishonest and false claim of the said witnesses.” 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Mst. MIR ZALAI versus 
GHAZI KHAN and others (2020 S C M R 319) has held as under:- 
“Both the eye-witnesses produced by the prosecution had claimed that 
while handling Afsar Khan deceased their clothes had been smeared with 
the blood of the deceased but admittedly no such blood-stained clothes of 
the said eye-witnesses had been secured or produced”. 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan  in the case of NADEEM alias KALA versus 
The State and others (2018 S C M R 153) has  held as under:- 
 “For the following reasons the prosecution case against the 
appellant is doubtful in nature:- 
(a)        …….. 
(b)        Presence of both the witnesses of ocular account i.e. Tariq 
Mehmood complainant (PW.8) and Tahir Mehmood (PW.9) at the 
place of occurrence is also not free from doubts. During cross-

examination the complainant stated that Maqsood Ahmad (deceased) 
in injured condition was shifted to Civil Hospital on a carry van but 
he could not disclose the registration number of the van or name of 
the driver of vehicle. He also deposed during his cross-examination 
that his clothes were also stained with blood but stated that he did 
not produce the blood stained clothes to the Police.” 
21. 
Another aspect drawing our grave concern is the fact that the prosecution 
witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and 
Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) made blatant improvements to their previous 
statements in order to bring the ocular account as narrated by them in line with the 
opinion and observations of Dr. Liaquat Ali Ansari (PW-8), who had conducted 
the post mortem examination of the dead body. The prosecution witnesses namely 
Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed 
(PW-3) made a deliberate and dishonest departure from their earlier narrations of 
the occurrence while deposing before the learned trial court. The prosecution 
witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1)   was cross-examined in this regard and the 
learned trial court observed as under:- 
“ I had recorded in my examination in chief that Irfan alias Punna made 
straight fire from the front side which hit on the left side of Naaf 
(abdomen) of Abid Hussain. Confronted with Ex.DB where it is not so 
recorded, however, it is recorded that Irfan alias Punna and 
Muhammad Ashraf alias Kalo made repeated fires with their 
respective weapons which hit on the abdomen of deceased, left side of 
Naaf, left thigh and left buttock of deceased Abid Hussain. I had 
recorded in my examination in chief that in the meanwhile Ashraf alias 
Kalo made fire which hit on the left thigh of Abid Hussain due to which 
my brother Abid fell down on the ground. Confronted with Ex.DB 
where it is not so recorded, however, it is recorded that Irfan alias 
Punna and Muhammad Ashraf alias Kalo made repeated fires with 

Murder Reference No.64 of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 518 of 2019

34 
 
their respective weapons which hit on the abdomen of deceased, left 
side of Naaf left thigh, left buttock of deceased Abid Hussain. It is 
recorded in examination in chief that in the meanwhile Irfan, Ashraf 
accused with their respective weapons made fires which hit on the left side 
of buttock of Abid. Confronted with Ex.DB where it is not so recorded, 
however, it is recorded that Irfan alias Punna and Muhammad Ashraf 
alias Kalo made repeated fires with their respective weapons which 
hit on the abdomen of deceased, left side of Naaf, left thigh, left 
buttock of deceased Abid Hussain. I had mentioned in my examination 
in chief we made repeated requests to the accused persons but the accused 
persons did not accepted our requests. Confrotned with Ex.DB where it is 
not so recorded. I have mentioned in my examination in chief that during 
this time Amjad S/o Muhammad Ramzan made a fire which hit on the 
tank of motor bike of Abid Hussain. Confronted with Ex.DB where it is 
not so recorded. 
………… 
I have got recorded in my statement Ex-DB that Muhammad Ashraf made 
a fire with repeater which hit Abid Hussain on the left thigh of Abid 
Hussain due to which my brother Abid Hussain fell down on the ground 
upside down. Confronted with Ex-DB where it is not recorded so. I 
have also got recorded in my statement Ex-DB that Muhammad Ashraf 
alias Kalo son of Muhammad Asghar made a fire which hit on the left side 
of Kohal of Abid Hussain. Confronted with Ex-DB where it is not so 
recorded. ”(emphasis supplied).  
The other prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and 
Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) also made dishonest and blatant improvements to 
their previous statements which have already been alluded to in the earlier part of 

Murder Reference No.64 of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 518 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No.674 of 2019 
 
 
35 
 
the judgment. By improving their previous statements , the prosecution witnesses 
namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad 
Saeed Javed (PW-3)   impeached their own credit. Article 151 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order 1984 provides as under: - 
“151. Impeaching credit of witness. The credit of a witness may be 
impeached in the following ways by the adverse party, or, with the 
consent of the Court, by the party who calls him: 
(1) by the evidence of persons who testify that they, from their 
knowledge of the witness, believe him to be un worthy of credit; 
(2) by proof that the witness has been bribed, or has accepted the offer of 
a bribe, or has received any other corrupt inducement to give his 
evidence; 
(3) by proof of former statements inconsistent with any part of his 
evidence which is liable to be contradicted ;” 
As the prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf 
(PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3)  introduced dishonest, blatant and 
substantial improvements to their previous statements and were duly confronted 
with their former statements, hence their credit stands impeached and the 
prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) 
and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) cannot be relied upon on, being proved to 
have deposed with a slight, intended to mislead the court. The august Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in the case of “Muhammad Ashraf Vs. State” (2012 SCMR 419) 
took serious notice of the improvements introduced by witnesses and rejected their 
evidence. We, thus, are satisfied that the evidence  of the prosecution witnesses 
namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad 
Saeed Javed (PW-3) has no intrinsic worth and is to be rejected outrightly. The 

Murder Reference No.64 of 2018

36 
 
august Supreme Court of Pakistan in a recent case reported as “Muhammad 
Mansha Vs. The State” (2018 SCMR 772) has enunciated the following principle: 
 “Once the Court comes to the conclusion that the eye witnesses had made 
dishonest improvements in their statements then it is not safe to place 
reliance on their statements. It is also settled by this Court that whenever a 
witness made dishonest improvement in his version in order to bring his 
case in line with the medical evidence or in order to strengthen the 
prosecution case then his testimony is not worthy of credence”. 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case reported as Muhammad Arif Vs. 
The State (2019 SCMR 631) has enunciated the following principle: 
 “It is well established by now that when a witness improves his 
statement and moment it is observed that the said improvement was made 
dishonestly to strengthen the prosecution, such portion of his statement is 
to be discarded out of consideration. Having observed the improvements 
in the statements of both the witnesses of ocular account, we hold that it 
is not safe to rely on their testimony to maintain conviction and sentence 
of Muhammad Arif (appellant) on a capital charge.”  
Guidance is sought from the principle enunciated by the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the case of “Amin Ali and another Vs. The State” (2011 SCMR 323) 
where the august Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased to reject the evidence of 
injured witnesses and held as under:-  
“11. All the three witnesses deposed that the deceased had received 
three injuries, but the Medical Officer found six injuries on the person 
of the deceased. One of them had blackening. None of the witnesses 
deposed that any of the appellants had caused the injuries from a 
close range but on the contrary in the site plan the place of firing has 
been shown 8 feet away from the deceased. Thus from such a distance 
injury with blackening cannot be caused as it can be caused from a 
distance of less than 3 feet as per Modi's Medical Jurisprudence. The 
Medical Officer did not show as to which of the injury was entry or 
exit wound on the person of the deceased. The medical officer stated 
that metalic projectile was recovered from wound No.1/B which was 
an exit wound. If it was an exit wound then the metalic projectile 
would have been out of the body. The presence of metalic projectile in 
the body clearly establishes the fact that it is not an exit wound but an 
entry wound. The medical officer has not shown that any of the 
injuries had inverted or averted margins so as to ascertain as to 
which of the injuries is entry or exit wound. Thus on this count there 
is a conflict between the medical and oral evidence. Furthermore, 
according to Medical Officer, the P.W.15 had four injuries out of 
them two were entry and two were exit wounds but the P.Ws. 13 and 

Murder Reference No.64 of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 518 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No.674 of 2019 
 
 
37 
 
14 deposed that the injured had received three injuries. Thus the 
P.Ws. have shown one exit wound as entry wound. With regard to the 
injured Tanveer Hussain, the Medical Officer showed two injuries 
one entry wound on the chest and one exit wound on the back but all 
the three eye-witnesses deposed that P.W.14 had received two injuries 
on his chest. As regards injuries on the person of Mst. Maqbool Bibi. 
The Medical Officer found one entry wound on her back with 
blackening, whereas P.Ws. 13, 14 and 15 deposed that the fire shot 
was fired from the roof of the shop. Entry wound with blackening 
marks cannot be caused from such a long distance. From the above 
position it is manifest that the ocular testimony is in conflict with the 
medical evidence. Thus, the deceased and injured did not receive the 
injuries in the manner, as alleged by the prosecution. 
………………………………. 
13. From the above evidence of the P. Ws., they do not appear to be 
truthful witnesses; therefore, no implicit reliance can be placed on 
their evidence.” 
 
22. 
We have also noticed with concern that the prosecution witnesses namely 
Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed 
(PW-3) made statements not supported by any other evidence with regard to what 
transpired after the accused had fled from the spot. According to the prosecution 
witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) , after the accused had fled away from the 
spot, he and the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) took the 
deceased in an injured condition on a motorcycle to Badhla Sant and there shifted 
the deceased, then injured, to the ambulance of the Punjab Emergency Service 
Rescue 1122  which took the injured to the Nishtar Hospital Multan and the 
deceased remained admitted at the Nishtar Hospital Multan till his death. The 
prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) in his statement before the 
learned trial court, stated as under:- 
“ We made a call on 1122 rescue and also made call on 15-police rescue. I 
alongwith Muhammad Ashraf escorted my brother Abid Hussain on my 
motorcycle and went to Budhlasant. When reached at Budhlasant 1122 reached

38 
 
there on which we shifted Abid Hussain on the vehicle of 1122 and went to 
Nishtar Hospital.. Multan and reached at Emergency Ward and Abid Hussin got 
admitted there.” 
During the course of cross-examination , the prosecution witness namely Khalid 
Hussain (PW-1) himself admitted that he had not mentioned the shifting of the 
deceased in an injured condition to Badhla Sant by him and the prosecution 
witness namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) on a motorcycle in any earlier 
statement. The prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) admitted 
during cross-examination, as under:- 
“It is correct that I have not mentioned anywhere that I alongwith 
Muhammad Ashraf shifted Abid Hussain deceased to the hospital. I have not 
produced the motorcycle to the I.O. on which we shifted the deceased to Budhla 
road”. (emphasis supplied)  
Ghulam Mustafa, SI (PW-6), the Investigating Officer of the case, admitted during 
cross-examination that in the proceedings recorded by him on the oral statement 
(Exh. PA), it had been mentioned by him that after recording the oral statement 
(Exh. PA) of Khalid Hussain (PW-1), the injured Abid Hussain (deceased) was 
being shifted to the Nishtar Hospital, Multan. Ghulam Mustafa, SI (PW-6), the 
Investigating Officer of the case, stated during cross-examination, as under:- 
“ It is correct that it is lastly and thereafter ان یب سن ل
ای ہے درست ہے کاروائ
ی کو written 
in Ex-PA that after the words it has been separately written that Abid 
Hussain is shifted to Nishtar Hospital.” (emphasis supplied)  
Irshad ul Hassan, Inspector (CW-1), the other Investigating Officer of the case, 
stated that the prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad

Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) never told him  that the 
deceased , in an injured condition, was taken to the Nishtar Hospital Multan on the 
ambulance of the Punjab Emergency Service Rescue 1122. Irshad ul Hassan, 
Inspector (CW-1), during cross-examination , stated as under:- 
“ PWS or the complainant never stated before me that who had telephone 1122 
and who had shifted the deceased on 1122” 
Another grave contradiction in the prosecution evidence which reflects that the 
prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) 
and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) were not present at the place of occurrence 
and did not have knowledge about the details of the occurrence is the 
contradictions in the statements of the prosecution witnesses with regard to the 
place where post mortem examination of the dead body was conducted. According 
to the prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) and the prosecution 
witness namely Kajeer Khan 2230/C (PW-5), the post-mortem examination of the 
dead body was conducted at Nishtar Hospital, Multan, whereas according to the 
statement of Dr. Liaquat Ali Ansari (PW-8), he conducted the post mortem 
examination of the dead body at RHC Makhdoom Rasheed, Multan. The 
prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) stated during cross-
examination , as under:- 
“ After the mortem examination of deceased I received the dead body from 
Nishtar Hospital.” 
The prosecution witness namely Kajeer Khan 2230/C (PW-5), in his statement 
before the learned trial court, stated as under:- 

Murder Reference No.64 of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 518 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No.674 of 2019 
 
 
40 
 
“ I reached at RHC, Makhdoom Rasheed where Dr. Liaqat Ali Ansari directed me 
to get conduct post mortem of deceased from, Nishtar Hospital. Multan. After 
that I reached Nishtar Hospital, Multan at about 11:45 a.m. where post 
mortem examination of deceased was conducted at 1:00 p.m” (emphasis 
supplied)  
Contradicting both the prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) and the 
prosecution witness namely Kajeer Khan 2230/C (PW-5), that the post mortem 
examination of the dead body was conducted at Nishtar Hospital, Multan, Dr. 
Liaquat Ali Ansari (PW-8) stated that he had conducted the post mortem 
examination of the dead body at RHC Makhdoom Rasheed, Multan. Dr. Liaquat 
Ali Ansari (PW-8), in his statement recorded by the learned trial court, stated as 
under:- 
“ On 22.02.2016 I was posted as Medical Officer at RHC, Makhdoom 
Rasheed, Multan. On the same day, the dead body of deceased Abid Hussain son 
of Muhammad Rafique, aged about 26-year, caste Sahoo r/o Chah Jhal Mouza 
Multani Wala was brought before me by Kajeer Khan 2230/C P/s Budhlasant, 
Multan for post mortem examination alongwith injury statement/application Ex-
PZ. 
……………….. 
I received the dead body of deceased with documents at 12:10 p.m. As soon as I 
received the complete documents I started the post mortem examination at12:30 
p.m.” 
The witnesses who did not even know where the post mortem examination of the 
dead body was conducted cannot be believed with regard to other facts deposed by 
them.

23. 
The learned Additional Prosecutor General and the learned counsels for the 
complainant placed much emphasis on the promptitude with which the oral 
statement (Exh. PA) of Khalid Hussain was recorded by Ghulam Mustafa, SI (PW-
6), the Investigating Officer of the case, and stated that this excluded the possibility 
of any pre-concert prior to the recording of the oral statement (Exh. PA). We have 
noted with grave concern that the prosecution failed miserably to prove with any 
consistency the place where the oral statement (Exh. PA) was recorded. According 
to the prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) when he was present at 
the Nishtar Hospital, Multan and the deceased had been admitted to the said 
hospital, that the oral statement (Exh. PA) was recorded by Ghulam Mustafa, SI 
(PW-6), the Investigating Officer of the case. Khalid Hussain (PW-1), in his 
statement before the learned trial court, stated as under:- 
“ I alongwith Muhammad Ashraf escorted my brother Abid Hussain on my 
motorcycle and went to Budhlasant. When reached at Budhlasant. 1122 reached 
there on which we shifted Abid Hussain on the vehicle of 1122 and went to 
Nishtar Hospital, Multan and reached at Emergency Ward and Abid Hussain got 
admitted there. Ghulam Mustafa, ASI along with other police officials came at 
Nishtar Hospital, Multan. I narrated the occurrence to Ghulam Mustafa. ASI 
who drafted the complaint Ex-PA and my signature over it is Ex-PA/1.” 
(emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) was contradicted by the 
prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) in so much so that 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) stated that the police had already arrived at the place of 
occurrence prior to the departure from the same to the hospital and it was after 

Murder Reference No.64 of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 518 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No.674 of 2019 
 
 
42 
 
giving information to the police at the place of occurrence that they had gone to the 
hospital. Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2), during cross-examination, stated as under:- 
“ After the occurrence I remained at the place of occurrence till 9:00 p.m. and 
police reached at 9:00 p.m. and we left after informing the police to the 
Hospital.” 
The above referred reply of Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) also proves that the oral 
statement (Exh. PA) was recorded later than 09.00 p.m and not at 07.45 p.m, the 
time of recording the oral statement (Exh. PA) as was mentioned by Ghulam 
Mustafa, SI (PW-6). We have already referred to the statement of Ghulam 
Mustafa, SI (PW-6), the Investigating Officer of the case, that according to the 
proceedings recorded on the oral statement (Exh. PA), it was after the same had 
been recorded that the deceased was taken to the Nishtar Hospital, Multan. It is 
also worrying to know that despite the claim of the prosecution witness namely 
Khalid Hussain (PW-1) that the deceased was admitted at the Nishtar Hospital, 
Multan on 21.02.2016 and Ghulam Mustafa, SI (PW-6), the Investigating Officer 
of the case, had also recorded his oral statement (Exh. PA) at the Nishtar Hospital, 
Multan but no medical record of the Nishtar Hospital, Multan is available proving 
that the deceased was brought to the said hospital in an injured condition or that the 
deceased was admitted in the Emergency Ward of the Nishtar Hospital, Multan in 
an injured condition or that any Medical Officer had examined him in the said 
hospital. The learned counsel for the complainant has rightly pointed out that there 
was evidence that the deceased died in the Nishtar Hospital, Multan, however, has 
not been able to deny this fact also that there does not exist any documentary 
record that the deceased was ever brought to the Nishtar Hospital, Multan in an 

Murder Reference No.64 of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 518 of 2019

43 
 
injured condition and who had brought the deceased in an injured condition to the 
Nishtar Hospital, Multan and when the deceased was admitted in the said hospital 
and who was the Medical Officer who had treated the deceased in an injured 
condition at the Nishtar Hospital, Multan. We have also noted that Ghulam 
Mustafa, SI (PW-6), the Investigating Officer of the case, claimed that after 
recording the oral statement (Exh. PA) he prepared the injury statement regarding 
the injuries observed by him on the body of the deceased, who was alive at the 
time of recording of the oral statement (Exh. PA), however, the said injury 
statement was not produced before the learned trial court and there is not even the 
copy of the said document available with the record. All the documents which 
were produced by the prosecution relate to the death of the deceased in the Nishtar 
Hospital, Multan, however, there is no document reflecting or proving the 
admission of the deceased in an injured condition in the Nishtar Hospital, Multan. 
This fatal flaw in the prosecution case denudes the effort made by the police 
officials to prop up the failing prosecution case and to deflect attention from the 
obvious indicators proving the absence of the prosecution witnesses namely Khalid 
Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) 
at the time of occurrence, at the place of occurrence. The scrutiny of the statements 
of the prosecution witnesses reveals that the oral statement (Exh. P.A.) of Khalid 
Hussain (PW-1) was neither prompt nor spontaneous nor natural, rather was a 
contrived, manufactured and a compromised document. No corroboration of the 
prosecution evidence can be had from the said oral statement (Exh. PA) of Khalid 
Hussain (PW-1). Sufficient doubts have arisen and inference against the 
prosecution has to be drawn in this regard.

 The learned Additional Prosecutor General and the learned counsels for the 
complainant, have submitted that the recovery of the Repeater gun (P-5) and the 
Toka (P-6)  from the appellant namely Irfan alias Punna son of Umar Daraz alias 
Dazi and the recovery of the Repeater gun and the motorcycle (P-10) from the 
appellant namely  Muhammad Ashraf alias Kaloo son of Muhammad Asghar 
offered sufficient corroboration of the statements of the prosecution witnesses 
namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad 
Saeed Javed (PW-3). Regarding the recovery of the Repeater gun (P-5) and the 
Toka (P-6)  from the appellant namely Irfan alias Punna son of Umar Daraz alias 
Dazi and the recovery of the Repeater gun and the motorcycle (P-10) from the 
appellant namely  Muhammad Ashraf alias Kaloo son of Muhammad Asghar, the 
same cannot be relied upon as the Investigating Officer of the case, did not join 
any witness of the locality during the recovery of the Repeater gun (P-5) and the 
Toka (P-6)  from the appellant namely Irfan alias Punna son of Umar Daraz alias 
Dazi and the recovery of the Repeater gun and the motorcycle (P-10) from the 
appellant namely  Muhammad Ashraf alias Kaloo son of Muhammad Asghar 
which was in clear violation of section 103 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. 
Irshad ul Hassan, Inspector (CW-1), the Investigating Officer of the case, admitted 
during cross-examination , as under:- 
“At the time of alleged recoveries, I had not associated any respectable of the locality 
etc.” 
The provisions of section 103 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, unfortunately, 
are honoured more in disuse than compliance. To appreciate it better, this 
section is being reproduced:- 

Murder Reference No.64 of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 518 of 2019

"103.--(1) Before making a search under this chapter, the officer or other 
person about to make it shall call upon two or more respectable 
inhabitants of the locality in which the place to be searched is situate 
to attend and witness the search and may issue an order in writing to 
them or any of them so to do.” 
 
Therefore, the evidence of the recovery of the Repeater gun (P-5) and the Toka (P-
6)  from the appellant namely Irfan alias Punna son of Umar Daraz alias Dazi and 
the recovery of the Repeater gun and the motorcycle (P-10) from the appellant 
namely  Muhammad Ashraf alias Kaloo son of Muhammad Asghar cannot be used 
as incriminating evidence against the appellants, being evidence that was obtained 
through illegal means and hence hit by the exclusionary rule of evidence The 
august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Muhammad Ismail and others Vs. 
The State ( 2017 SCMR 898) at page 901 has held as under:- 
“For the above mentioned recovery of weapons the prosecution had failed to 
associate any independent witness of the locality and, thus, the mandatory 
provisions of section 103, Cr.P.C. had flagrantly been violated in that regard.”  
 
Moreover, the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) was 
contradicted during cross-examination with his previous statement recorded during 
the inquiry proceedings of the instant case instituted upon the private complaint,  
where he had not mentioned that any recovery of any weapon or the motorcycle 
was made from the appellants, contrary to what was stated  by him in his statement 
before the learned trial court . Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) was questioned in 
this regard and the learned trial court observed as under:- 
“I have got recorded in my cursory statement Ex-DK that on the same day I 
joined the investigation at police station and police took us with them to arrest the 
accused persons and when we alongwith the police reached at the house of 
accused Umerdraz in kitchen under Makkhi Dan a chopped leg of deceased

identified by the complainant and the same was taken into possession by the I.O. 
vide recovery memo (Ex-PL), attested by me and Sajid Hussain PW. The I.O. 
recorded my statement in this regard at the spot. Confronted with Ex-DK where 
the all above said facts/statements were not recorded. I have also got recorded 
in my cursory statement Ex-DK that on 06.03.2016 I again joined the 
investigation at police station Saddar, Multan and during investigation the 
accused Irfan disclosed that the repeater with which I made a fire to the deceased 
is lying in my residential room and I can get recovered the same and on the 
pointation of the accused Muhammad Irfan repeater 12-bore P/5 was recovered 
from the residential room of accused Muhammad Irfan and the I.O. into 
possession. Confronted with Ex-DK where it is not recorded. I have got 
recorded in my cursory statement Ex-DK that at the same time during the 
investigation the accused Irfan disclosed that a Toka with which the leg of the 
deceased was cut is lying in the room of his father/co-accused Umerdraz and the 
blood stained Toka was recovered on the pointation of the accused Irfan from the 
residential room of the co- accused/father of the accused Muhammad Irfan and 
the said Toka P/6 was taken into possession by the I.O. through recovery memo, 
attested by me and Muhammad Amjid and the I.O. recorded our statements in this 
regard. Confronted with Ex-DK where it is not recorded. I have correctly 
recorded my cursory statement Ex-DK before the Hon'abe Judge of ATC. I 
have got recorded my cursory statement Ex-DK in my senses. 
Whatever I have got recorded in my cursory statement the Ilon'able Judge of ATC 
recorded the same without any omission. 
………….. 
I have not got recorded in my cursory statement Ex-DK that the repeater which 
was recovered on the pointation of accused Irfan was unloaded by the police and 
three live cartridges (P7/1-3) were recovered which were taken into possession 
vide recovery memo (Ex-PM) and police asked from the accused Irfan about the

licence of repeater but he could not produce due to which separate proceedings 
were initiated against him. I have recorded my cursory statement only to the 
extent of narration of private complaint and I have not given the statement 
about recovery at that time. I have not got recorded in cursory statement Ex-
DK about the recoveries, which I have mentioned in my examination in chief 
despite the fact that those have been allegedly recovered before my recording 
cursory statement. I have not got recorded in my cursory statement Ex-DK that 
on 06.03.2016 the accused Muhammad Ashraf during investigation disclosed the 
repeater 12-bore with which he made fire to the deceased can get recovered the 
same. I have also not got recorded in my cursory statement that on 21.03.2016 
during the course of interrogation the accused Muhammad Ashraf made 
disclosure for recovery of motorcycle 125 black colour used in the occurrence and 
can get recovered from the nephew of Muhammad Sajid. I have also not got 
recorded in my cursory statement Ex-DK that the I.O. took the same into 
possession vide recovery memo . 
………… 
Since the institution of this private complaint Ex-PF we have not changed our 
counsel. I have got recorded my cursory statement voluntarily and with my own 
free consent. 
I have never moved an application before the learned ATC that my cursory 
statement is not correctly recorded.” (emphasis supplied)  
The above referred portion of the statement of prosecution witness namely 
Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) makes it abundantly clear that no reliance upon 
the statement of Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3). We have also noted that the 
appellants namely Irfan alias Punna and Muhammad Ashraf alias Kaloo were 
arrested on 22.02.2016, the Repeater gun (P-5) and the Toka (P-6)  from the 
appellant namely Irfan alias Punna son of Umar Daraz alias Dazi and the Repeater 
gun from the appellant namely  Muhammad Ashraf alias Kaloo son of Muhammad

Asghar were recovered on  06.03.2016,  however the empty cartridges  taken into 
possession from the place of occurrence were sent to Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore on 23.02.2016 though there was no reason for keeping the empty 
cartridges  which were taken into possession of  on the day of occurrence   at the 
Police Station and not sending them to the office of Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore till 23.02.2016 i.e. after the appellants had been arrested on 
22.02.2016. In this manner the report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore. 
(Exh. PUU) regarding the comparison of the  empty cartridges taken from the 
place of occurrence with the Repeater guns  recovered from the appellants,  has no 
evidentiary value as the possibility of fabrication is apparent. Reliance is placed on 
the case of Muhammad Amin Vs. The State and another (2019 S C M R 2057) 
wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held as under:- 
“Interestingly, two empty cartridges (P-4/1-2) were secured from the 
place of occurrence by the investigating officer Akhtar Ali, SI (PW12) 
on the night of 11.10.2012, but the same were sent to the office of 
Punjab Forensic Science Agency on 23.01.2013 i.e. after arrest of the 
appellant in this case. In these circumstances, the positive report of FSL 
is of no avail to the prosecution and is inconsequential.” 
 
With regard to the recovery of the motorcycle (P-10) from the appellant namely 
Muhammad Ashraf alias Kaloo on 21.03.2016, we have noticed that none of the 
prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) 
and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) mentioned either the Make, the model, the 
colour or the registration number of the motorcycle which they had noted the 
appellants  arriving on at the place of occurrence. The prosecution witness namely 
Khalid Hussain (PW-1)  admitted during cross-examination , as under:- 
“I have not mentioned any specific made/model, colour and registration number 
of the motorcycles of the accused persons. ” 

Murder Reference No.64 of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 518 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No.674 of 2019 
 
 
49 
 
In view of the above statement of Khalid Hussain (PW-1), the recovered 
motorcycle (P-10) cannot be said to be the same motorcycle which was used by the 
appellants to arrive at the place of occurrence, hence, the recovery of the 
motorcycle (P-10) offers no support of the prosecution case.  In view of the above-
mentioned facts, the alleged recovery of the Repeater gun (P-5) and the Toka (P-6)  
from the appellant namely Irfan alias Punna son of Umar Daraz alias Dazi and the 
recovery of the Repeater gun and the motorcycle (P-10) from the appellant namely  
Muhammad Ashraf alias Kaloo son of Muhammad Asghar  are not proved and the 
same cannot be used as a circumstance against the appellants. Even otherwise, as 
we have disbelieved the ocular account in this case, hence, the evidence of the 
recovery of the Repeater gun (P-5) and the Toka (P-6) from the appellant namely 
Irfan alias Punna son of Umar Daraz alias Dazi and the recovery of the Repeater 
gun and the motorcycle (P-10) from the appellant namely Muhammad Ashraf alias 
Kaloo son of Muhammad Asghar would have no consequence. It is an admitted 
rule of appreciation of evidence that recovery is only a supporting piece of 
evidence and if the ocular account is found to be unreliable, then the recovery has 
no evidentiary value. 
 
25.       The Learned Additional Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the 
complainant have also relied upon the evidence of motive and submitted that it 
corroborated the ocular account. The motive of the occurrence as stated by the 
prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) 
and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) was that the prosecution witness namely 
Khalid Hussain (PW-1) had a dog stolen for which theft he got a case registered 
against the appellants and that subsequently an incident of firing had taken place 

Murder Reference No.64 of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 518 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No.674 of 2019 
 
 
50 
 
between the prosecution witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) and the accused, 
in retaliation of which the accused acted on the day of the occurrence. As has been 
already discussed by us, had the motive of occurrence been as was stated by the 
prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) 
and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3), then the prosecution witnesses namely 
Khalid Hussain (PW-1)  would have been the prime target, however, he was not 
targeted at all, clearly proving the fact that the motive as stated by the prosecution 
witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and 
Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) was not the motivation of the assailants. 
Furthermore, it is settled law that motive is a double-edge weapon, which can 
cut either way; if it  was the reason for the appellants to murder the deceased, it 
equally was a ground for the complainant to falsely implicate them in this case. 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in the case of Muhammad Ashraf 
Alias Acchu v. The State (2019 S C M R 652) as under:- 
“7.         The motive is always a double-edged weapon. The 
complainant Sultan Ahmad (PW9) has admitted murder enmity 
between the parties and has also given details of the same in his 
statement recorded before the trial court. No doubt, previous enmity 
can be a reason for the appellant to commit the alleged crime, but it 
can equally be a reason for the complainant side to falsely implicate 
the appellant in this case for previous grouse.” 
Reliance is also placed on the case of “Liaqat Ali and 11 others v. The State” 
(1992 S C M R 372) wherein it has been held as under:- 
“In this behalf, it may be observed that the motive is a double-edged 
weapon which could be one of the reasons for false implication as well 
as has been held by the Supreme Court in the case of Allah Bakhsh and 
another v. The State (PLD 1978 SC 171).”

26.         We have also noted that video footage of a program recorded by the News 
Channel namely Sama News with the interviewer being Zeeshan Malik , stored in a 
USB flash drive, taken into possession through recovery memo (Exh.PE), was also 
handed over  by the complainant of the case to the Investigating Officer of the case  
on 25.07.2016, which video footage showed the appellants namely Irfan alias 
Punna and Muhammad Ashraf alias Kaloo admitting to their guilt. Furthermore, 
the said video footage as contained in the USB flash drive, taken into possession 
through recovery memo (Exh. PE), was also used during cross-examination to 
confront the prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad 
Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3). The guidelines to prove an 
audio or video in the Court have been enumerated by the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the case of “Ishtiaq Ahmed Mirza and others v. Federation of Pakistan 
and others” (PLD 2019 SC 675), as under: 
“11. 
The precedent cases mentioned above show that in the matter of proving an

* 
No audio tape or video can be relied upon by a court until the same is

audio tape or video himself. 
* 
The audio tape or video must be played in the court. 
* 
An audio tape or video produced before a court as evidence ought to be

 Irshad ul Hassan, Inspector (CW-1), Investigating Officer of the case, admittedly 
did not record the statement of the person who had recorded the video footage as 
stored  in  the USB flash drive ,taken into possession through recovery memo 
(Exh.PE). Admittedly no person who had recorded the video footage as stored in  
the USB flash drive ,taken into possession through recovery memo (Exh.PE),  
appeared before the learned trial court as a witness. Moreover the video footage as 
stored in  the USB flash drive, taken into possession through recovery memo

(Exh.PE) was not analyzed by the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore 
regarding its genuineness or otherwise. In the absence of any report of the Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency, Lahore about the genuineness or otherwise of the said 
video footage as stored in  the USB flash drive ,taken into possession through 
recovery memo (Exh.PE), no reliance can be placed on such piece of evidence as 
held in the case of “Asfandyar and another v. Kamran and another” (2016 SCMR 
2084). The learned trial court rightly held that the video footage of a program 
recorded by the News Channel namely Sama News with the interviewer being 
Zeeshan Malik , stored in a USB flash drive, taken into possession through 
recovery memo (Exh.PE), which video footage showed the appellants namely Irfan 
alias Punna and Muhammad Ashraf alias Kaloo admitting to their guilt, could not 
be considered as admissible and relevant evidence. As mentioned above, the said 
video footage as stored in  the USB flash drive, taken into possession through 
recovery memo (Exh.PE), was also used during cross-examination to confront the 
prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) 
and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3), which confrontation should also have not 
been allowed by the learned trial court . 
 
27.         The only other piece of evidence left to be considered by us is the medical 
evidence with regard to the injuries observed on the dead body of the deceased by 
Dr. Liaquat Ali Ansari (PW-8)   but the same is of no assistance in this case as 
medical evidence by its nature and character, cannot recognize a culprit in case of 
an unobserved incidence. As all the other pieces of evidence relied upon by the 
prosecution in this case have been disbelieved and discarded by this Court, 
therefore, the appellant’s conviction cannot be upheld on the basis of medical 

Murder Reference No.64 of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 518 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No.674 of 2019 
 
 
54 
 
evidence alone. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in its binding judgment 
titled “Hashim Qasim and another Vs. The State” (2017 SCMR 986) has 
enunciated the following principle of law:  
“The medical evidence is only confirmatory or of supporting nature 
and is never held to be corroboratory evidence, to identify the 
culprit.”   
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in its binding judgment titled “Naveed 
Asghar and two others Vs. The State” (P L D 2021 Supreme Court 600) has 
enunciated the following principle of law:  
“31. 
The prosecution has attempted to complete the chain of circumstantial 
evidence by medical evidence relating to the post mortem examinations of the 
deceased persons. This evidence proves only the factum that death of the 
deceased persons was caused by cutting their throats through some sharp edge 
weapon; it does in no way indicate who had cut their throats and with what 
particular weapon. Medical evidence is in the nature of supporting, 
confirmatory or explanatory of the direct or circumstantial evidence, and is 
not "corroborative evidence" in the sense the term is used in legal parlance for 
a piece of evidence that itself also has some probative force to connect the 
accused person with the commission of offence. Medical evidence by itself 
does not throw any light on the identity of the offender. Such evidence may 
confirm the available substantive evidence with regard to certain facts 
including seat of the injury, nature of the injury, cause of the death, kind of the 
weapon used in the occurrence, duration between the injuries and the death, 
and presence of an injured witness or the injured accused at the place of 
occurrence, but it does not connect the accused with the commission of the 
offence. It cannot constitute corroboration for proving involvement of the 
accused person in the commission of offence, as it does not establish the 
identity of the accused person.32 Therefore, the medical evidence is of little 
help to the prosecution for bringing home the guilt to the petitioners.” 
 
28.      Considering all the above circumstances, we entertain serious doubt in our 
minds regarding the involvement of the appellants namely Irfan alias Punna son of 
Umar Daraz alias Dazi and Muhammad Ashraf alias Kaloo son of Muhammad 
Asghar in the present case. It is a settled principle of law that for giving benefit of 
the doubt it is not necessary that there should be so many circumstances rather, if 
only a single circumstance creating reasonable doubt in the mind of a prudent 

Murder Reference No.64 of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 518 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No.674 of 2019 
 
 
55 
 
person is available, then the such benefit is to be extended to an accused not as a 
matter of concession but as of right. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the 
case of "Muhammad Mansha Vs. The State" (2018 SCMR 772) has enunciated the 
following principle: 
"Needless to mention that while giving the benefit of doubt to an accused it 
is not necessary that there should be many circumstances creating doubt. 
If there is a circumstance which creates reasonable doubt in a prudent 
mind about the guilt of the accused, then the accused would be entitled to 
the benefit of such doubt, not as a matter of grace and concession, but as a 
matter of right. It is based on the maxim, "it is better that ten guilty 
persons be acquitted rather than one innocent person be convicted". 
Reliance in this behalf can be made upon the cases of Tariq Pervez v. The 
State (1995 SCMR 1345), Ghulam Qadir and 2 others v. The State (2008 
SCMR 1221), Muhammad Akramv.The State (2009 SCMR 230) and 
Muhammad Zamanv.The State (2014 SCMR 749)." 
 
Reliance is also placed on the judgment of the august Supreme Court of Pakistan 
"Najaf Ali Shah Vs. the State" (2021 S C M R 736) in which it has been held as:- 
"9. 
Mere heinousness of the offence if not proved to the hilt is not a 
ground to avail the majesty of the court to do complete justice. This is 
an established principle of law and equity that it is better that 100 
guilty persons should let off but one innocent person should not suffer. 
As the preeminent English jurist William Blackstone wrote, "Better that 
ten guilty persons escape, than that one innocent suffer." Benjamin 
Franklin, who was one of the leading figures of early American history, 
went further arguing "it is better a hundred guilty persons should 
escape than one innocent person should suffer." All the contradictions 
noted by the learned High Court are sufficient to cast a shadow of 
doubt on the prosecution's case, which entitles the petitioner to the 
right of benefit of the doubt. It is a well settled principle of law that for 
the accused to be afforded this right of the benefit of the doubt it is not 
necessary that there should be many circumstances creating 
uncertainty and if there is only one doubt, the benefit of the same must 
got to the petitioner. This Court in the case of Mst. Asia Bibi v. The 
State (PLD 2019 SC 64) while relying on the the earlier judgments of 
this Court has categorically held that "if a single circumstance creates 
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the apprehension of guilt of 
an accused, then he/she shall be entitled to such benefit not as a matter 
of grace and concession, but as of right. Reference in this regard may 
be made to the cases of Tariq Pervaiz v. The State (1998 SCMR 1345) 
and Ayub Masih v. The State (PLD 2002 SC 1048)." The same view was 
reiterated in Abdul Jabbar v. State (2010 SCMR 129) when this court 

Murder Reference No.64 of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 518 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No.674 of 2019 
 
 
56 
 
observed that once a single loophole is observed in a case presented by 
the prosecution, such as conflict in the ocular account and medical 
evidence or presence of eye-witnesses being doubtful, the benefit of 
such loophole/lacuna in the prosecution's case automatically goes in 
favour of an accused." 
 
29.  
 For what has been discussed above the Criminal Appeal No.518 of 2019 
lodged by the appellants namely Irfan alias Punna son of Umar Daraz alias Dazi 
and Muhammad Ashraf alias Kaloo son of Muhammad Asghar is allowed and the 
convictions and sentences of the appellants namely Irfan alias Punna son of Umar 
Daraz alias Dazi and Muhammad Ashraf alias Kaloo son of Muhammad Asghar 
awarded by the learned trial court through the impugned judgment dated 
06.05.2019 are hereby set-aside. Both the appellants namely Irfan alias Punna son 
of Umar Daraz alias Dazi and Muhammad Ashraf alias Kaloo son of Muhammad 
Asghar are ordered to be acquitted by extending them the benefit of doubt. Irfan 
alias Punna son of Umar Daraz alias Dazi and Muhammad Ashraf alias Kaloo son

The complainant of the case namely Khalid Hussain filed Criminal Appeal 
No.674 of 2019  against the acquittal of the accused namely Qaswar Hussain alias 
Pappi, Umar Daraz alias Dazi, Shahid Hussain and Amjad (all since acquitted),  
the co-accused of the appellants by the learned trial court.  We have observed that 
the learned trial court has rightly acquitted the said accused. The prosecution 
witness namely  Khalid Hussain (PW-1) stated that it was Qaswar Hussain alias 
Pappi (accused since acquitted) who had  chopped off  the right leg of the deceased 
from under the knee whereas the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ashraf 
(PW-2),  in his statement before the learned trial court stated that it was Umar

Daraz alias Dazi (accused since acquitted) who had chopped off  the right leg of 
the deceased  from under the knee, clearly revealing the bereft nature of statements 
made against both Qaswar Hussain alias Pappi and  Umar Daraz alias Dazi. With 
regard to the accused Amjad, he was not named in the F.I.R and was shown to be 
identified by the prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1), 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) in test 
identification parade proceedings held on 24.03.2016 however the prosecution 
witness namely Khalid Hussain (PW-1) admitted during cross-examination that 
Amjad was already known to him. Khalid Hussain (PW-1) admitted during cross 
examination as under :- 
“Accused Ajmad is my nominated accused in the FIR which I got registered for 
the theft of my dog before the occurrence of this case. I do not know whether 
accused Ajmid sought his pre- arrest from the competent court. It is correct that in 
the said case FIR compromise was effected in the court. It is correct that at the 
compromise of said pre-arrest bail in the said case FIR I and accused Ajmad 
were present in the court” (emphasis supplied)  
In this manner the failure of the prosecution witnesses namely Khalid Hussain 
(PW-1), Muhammad Ashraf (PW-2) and Muhammad Saeed Javed (PW-3) to name 
Amjad as accused proves that he was not seen by them at the place of occurrence 
otherwise they would have named him as an accused. The allegations against 
Shahid Hussain could also be not proved. It   is   important   to   note   that   
according   to   established principle of the criminal administration of justice once 
an acquittal is  recorded  in  favour  of  accused facing  criminal  charge  he  enjoys  
double presumption  of innocence, therefore, the courts competent to interfere in 
the acquittal order should be slow in converting the same into conviction,  unless

and  until  the  said  order is  patently illegal, shocking, based on misreading  and  
non-reading  of  the record or perverse.  The said principle has been enunciated by 
the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the judgment reported as “Ghulam 
Sikandar and another Versus Mamaraz Khan and Others” (P L D 1985 Supreme 
Court 11) wherein it has been held as under: 
“The Court would not interfere with acquittal merely because on re-
appraisal of the evidence it comes to the conclusion different from that of 
the Court acquitting the accused provided both the conclusions are 
reasonably possible. If however. the conclusion reached by that Court was 
such that no reasonable person would conceivably reach the same and was 
impossible then this Court would interfere in exceptional cases on 
overwhelming proof resulting in conclusion and irresistible conclusion; and 
that too with a view only to avoid grave miscarriage of justice and for no 
other purpose. The important test visualised in these cases, in this behalf 
was that the finding sought to be interfered with, after scrutiny under the 
foregoing searching light, should be found wholly as artificial, shocking and 
ridiculous.” 
 Reliance is placed on the case of “Muhammad   Inayat   Versus   The   State” 
(1998   SCMR   1854) wherein it has been held as under: 
“The judgment of acquittal qua Muhammad Yousaf, Muhammad Sated and 
Muhammad Nawaz cannot, in the given situation, be termed as perverse or 
foolish inasmuch as the view having been taken by the High Court can 
possibly be taken for acquitting them in the peculiar facts and circumstances 
of this case. It cannot be said that the impugned judgment of the High Court 
acquitting Muhammad Yousaf and two others is fanciful, artificial, shocking 
or ridiculous. 1t is based on convincing reasons” 
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Mst. Sughran Begum and 
another Vs. Qaiser Pervaiz and others” (2015 SCMR 1142) has held as under: 
“On acquittal, an accused person earns twofold innocence particularly, in 
the case when there are concurrent findings to that effect by the trial Court 
and the Court of First Appeal (High Court), is the bedrock principle of 
justice. In a case of acquittal, the standard and principle of appreciation of 
evidence is entirely different from that in a case of conviction. Unless the 
concurrent findings of the two Courts below are found perverse, fanciful,

arbitrary and are based on misreading and non-reading of material 
evidence causing miscarriage of justice, the Supreme Court would not 
lightly disturb the same because on reappraisal, another view might be 
possible therefore, sanctity is attached under the law to such concurrent 
findings in ordinary course.” 
 
 Pursuant to the discussion made and conclusions arrived at above, the Criminal 
Appeal No.674 of 2019, lodged by the complainant of the case namely Khalid 
Hussain  assailing the acquittal of Qaswar Hussain alias Pappi, Umar Daraz alias 
Dazi, Shahid Hussain and Amjad by the learned trial court from the charges is 
hereby dismissed.

Murder Reference No.64 of 2018 is answered in Negative and the sentence 
of death awarded to Irfan alias Punna son of Umar Daraz alias Dazi is  
Not Confirmed.
