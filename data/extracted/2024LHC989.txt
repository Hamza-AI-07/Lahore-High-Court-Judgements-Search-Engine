J U D G M E N T 
Date of Hearing: 
19.02.2024 
Petitioner by: 
Syed Kabeer Ahmad Mehmood, 
Advocate. 
Respondent No.1  by: 
Mr. Abdul Salam Alvi, Advocate. 
 
      Anwaar Hussain, J.  The petitioner, Sultan Mehmood Rana and 
respondent No.1, Naeem Ahmad (“the respondent”) with their mutual 
consent appointed respondents No.2 to 6 as Arbitrators/Umpire 
(“Arbitrators”) to decide the controversy between them. An award 
dated 04.06.2015 was rendered by the Arbitrators. On 27.06.2015, the 
respondent filed an application for cancellation/setting aside of the 
award, whereas, on 28.01.2016, the petitioner filed an application for 
making the award a Rule of the Court. Through consolidated judgment 
dated 09.12.2017, Civil Judge Class-II, Jahanian dismissed the 
application of the respondent and accepted the application of the 
petitioner and made the award Rule of the Court. An appeal was 
preferred by the respondent and vide impugned judgment and decree 
dated 26.02.2018, the Appellate Court below, without touching the 
merits of the case, held that the award cannot be made Rule of the 
Court as it was not filed by the petitioner within 90-days time period 
stipulated under Article 178 of the Limitation Act, 1908 (“the Act 
1908”).

2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the judgments of 
the Courts below are at variance. Adds that while the findings on the 
merits of the award has been maintained including dismissal of the 
application of the respondent to the extent of cancellation/setting aside 
of the award, it is erroneous on part of the Appellate Court below to 
hold that the application of the petitioner was time barred as no formal 
notice was issued by the Arbitrators regarding making and signing of 
the award in terms of Article 178 of the Act 1908. Adds that the 
question of limitation was not raised by the respondent and the findings 
of the Arbitrators cannot be set aside on the basis of technicalities. 
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent has supported the 
findings of the Appellate Court below and avers that there was no need 
of issuance of any formal notice to the petitioner by the Arbitrators 
inasmuch as the respondent and the petitioner gave security cheque(s) 
to the Arbitrators and when it was found by the Arbitrators that 
respondent is liable to pay an amount of Rs.954,018/-, to the petitioner, 
the security cheque issued by the respondent was filled and handed 
over to the petitioner, by the Arbitrators, who admittedly submitted the 
same in his bank, which fact indicates that no formal notice was 
required in terms of Article 178 of the Act 1908 and the petitioner was 
well aware of making and singing of the award.  
4. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
5. 
Interplay of the factual matrix of the case and the applicable law 
raises following questions to be answered by this Court:  
i. 
Whether the limitation period envisaged under Article 178 of 
the Act 1908, for filing an application to make the award a Rule 
of the Court commences from the date of issuance of formal 
notice in writing by the Arbitrator(s) to the parties or the general 

3 
C.R. No.931-D of 2018 
 
 
knowledge of the parties about making and signing of the award 
is sufficient to non-suit a litigant on question of limitation? 
ii. 
Can a Court dismiss the objections to the award but at the same 
time refuse to make the award a Rule of the Court on the ground 
that the application to that effect was not within limitation? 
6. 
Factual matrix of the case is not disputed. The sole ground on 
which the appeal of the respondent has been allowed while maintaining 
the findings on merits of the case and the petitioner’s application for 
making the award Rule of Court has been dismissed is point of 
limitation. This Court has gone through the impugned judgment, which 
proceeds on the premise that since the award was made in presence of 
the petitioner, therefore, he had notice of making of the award on the 
said date as cheque given by the respondent, dated 08.06.2015, was 
handed over to the petitioner, which was admittedly presented and was 
dishonoured, therefore, the petitioner had the notice for making of 
award on the said date. Before rendering the opinion on the points of 
determination formulated hereinabove, it will be advantageous to 
reproduce Article 178 of the Act 1908 as also Section 14(1) of the 
Arbitration Act, 1940 (“the Act 1940”) as the inter play of the said 
legal provisions regulates as to how the limitation period prescribed for 
filing an application for making the award a Rule of the Court is to be 
reckoned. Article 178 of the Act 1908 reads as under: 
 
Description  
Period 
of 
limitation 
Time 
from 
which 
period 
begins to run 
178.– Under the 
Arbitration 
Act, 
1940,(X of 1940) 
for the filing in 
Court of an award.  
Ninety days. 
The 
date 
of 
service of the 
notice of 
the 
making of the 
award. 

4 
C.R. No.931-D of 2018 
 
 
Whereas Section 14(1) of the Act 1940 reads as under:  
14. Award to be signed and filed.-(1) When the 
arbitrators or umpire have made their award, they shall 
sign it and shall give notice in writing to the parties of 
the making and signing thereof and of the amount of 
fees and charges payable in respect of the arbitration 
and award. 
Article 178 of the Act 1908 clearly depicts that the limitation starts 
from “the date of service of the notice of the making of the award”. 
Section 14(1) of the Act 1940 makes it clear that the Arbitrators after 
making and signing of the award have to give a notice, in writing, of 
the making and signing of the award to the parties. The requirement of 
a notice in writing is important as the service of notice is the point from 
which the limitation for making an application to the Court for filing 
the award commences per Article 178 of Act 1908. This Section is to 
be also read with Section 42 of the Act 1940, which provides that any 
notice that is required to be served by an Arbitrator shall be served in 
the manner provided in the arbitration agreement or if there is no such 
provision then by delivering it to the person on whom it is to be served 
or by sending it by post at the usual address of such person. Section 42 
of the Act 1940 reads as under: 
). 
42.  Service  of  notice  by  party  or  arbitrator.  Any  
notice  required  by  this  Act  to  be  served otherwise 
than through the Court by a party to an arbitration 
agreement or by an arbitrator or umpire shall be served 
in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement, or 
if there is no such provision, either— 
(a) 
by delivering it to the person on whom it is 
to be served, or 
(b) 
by sending it by post in a letter addressed to 
that person at his usual or last known place 
of abode or business in [Pakistan] and 
registered under Chapter VI of the Post 
Office Act, 1898. 

5 
C.R. No.931-D of 2018 
 
 
The afore-noted provisions make it clear that the Act 1940 provides a 
clear and specific manner in which the notice is to be served by the 
Arbitrator(s). There is no room of implied notice under the law in 
respect of making and signing of the award. The above quoted 
provisions of law have technical meanings and can only be construed 
as requiring of issuance of a separate notice in writing by the 
Arbitrator(s) notwithstanding the fact that a party has knowledge of the 
passing of the award through receipt of any instrument (cheque in the 
instant case) handed over to him for satisfaction of amount awarded by 
the Arbitrator(s). Suffice to observe that the law of limitation 
contemplates general principle of administration of justice, which has 
the effect of preventing a party from having recourse to redressal of 
rights through judicial process even where such rights subsist and 
therefore, any law whereby the recourse to the Court(s) is restricted, 
must be construed strictly. This Court is of considered opinion that the 
proceedings should only be held to be barred by time if the chicaneries 
of law of limitation are made applicable in strictest sense. Case 
reported as “Muhammad Shafi and others v. Muhammad Sabir and 
others.” (PLD 1960 Lahore 591) is referred in this regard. A question 
also arises as to how the limitation is to be governed, if no notice is 
given by the Arbitrator(s) to the party. This Court is of the opinion that 
in such eventuality it is Article 181 of the Act 1908, which is residuary 
clause that will be applicable and the same contemplates a period of 
three years. 
7. 
There is another angle from which the first legal question 
formulated hereinabove can be analysed. The Act 1940 makes it amply 
clear that after an award is rendered, any party thereto or any person 
claiming thereunder may request the Arbitrator(s) or the Umpire to 
cause the award or its signed copy thereof, together with any 
disposition or the document, which may have been taken and/or 

6 
C.R. No.931-D of 2018 
 
 
proved, to be filed in the Court. It is pertinent to mention here that no 
limitation has been provided under the Act 1908 whereby the party is 
required to make a request to the Arbitrators or the Umpire to cause the 
award to be filed in the Court and again residuary Article 181 of the 
Act 1908 is applicable and a party to arbitration proceedings can make 
such a request to the Arbitrators within three years time period from the 
date of making and signing of the award. Here it is imperative to 
observe that the object of giving notice to the parties is to enable them 
to file an application for setting aside the award. It is worth mentioning 
that when the respondent filed an application for cancellation of the 
award, he also categorically acknowledged that the Arbitrators have not 
issued any formal notice, in writing, to the parties regarding making of 
the award. Para No.4 of the application of the respondent reads as 
under:

8. 
Adverting to the second question as to whether a Court can 
dismiss the objections to the award but at the same time refuse to make 
the award a Rule of the Court on the ground that the application of a 
party for filing/making the award a Rule of the Court was not within 
limitation, it is pertinent to mention that once an award is before the 
Court, either through the Arbitrator(s) or any party (for example the 
respondent), then in terms of Section 17 of the Act 1940, it is the duty 
of Court to examine the same and see whether it suffers from any 

7 
C.R. No.931-D of 2018 
 
 
patent illegality or if there is any cause to remit the award to the 
Arbitrator(s) irrespective of the fact that opposite party (the petitioner 
in present case) has not approached the Court within time. Section 17 
of the Act 1940 reads as under:  
17. Judgment in terms of award. Where the Court sees 
no cause to remit the award or any of  the  matters  
referred  to  arbitration  for  reconsideration  or  to  set  
aside  the  award,  the  Court  shall, after  the  time  for  
making  an application  to  set  aside  the  award  has  
expired,  or  such  application having  been  made  after  
refusing  it,  proceed  to  pronounce  judgment  according  
to  the  award,  and upon  the  judgment  so  pronounced  
a  decree  shall  follow,  and  no  appeal  shall  lie  from  
such  decree except on the ground that it is in excess of, 
or not otherwise in accordance with, the award. 
The above quoted provision of the Act 1940 is couched in mandatory 
terms as the same is signified by use of the word “shall” and cast a duty 
upon the Court to pass a decree if it sees no cause to remit or set aside 
the award. The proceedings under Section 17 commence once an award 
has been filed in the Court. The very fact that the respondent filed an 
application seeking cancellation/setting aside of the award means that it 
was admitted that the award had been made and that the proceedings 
under Section 17 of the Act 1940 would commence. In case reported as 
“Noor Muhammad vs ADJ Nankana Sahib etc. (1996 CLC 268), it has 
been held as under: 
“6…….The provisions of section 17 of the Act deal with 
cases where the award actually comes before the Court 
either through a party or the arbitrator. Once an award 
comes before the Court then the Court has got 
jurisdiction to take further proceedings in accordance 
with the law and pass a decree thereon. The scheme 
of section 17 of the Act is that  after an award is filed in 
the Court then an opportunity is given to the party 
challenging its legality or correctness to file an objection 
petition to set aside the award. Such a petition has to be 
filed within a period of 30 days under Article 158 of the 
Limitation Act, failing which the party in whose favour 

8 
C.R. No.931-D of 2018 
 
 
the award is made is entitled to a decree in  his favour. If 
the objection petition is dismissed on merits, then also 
the party holding the award in his favour is entitled to 
a decree. The above exercise contemplated under 
section 17 of the Act is necessary if the award has 
been filed in the Court.” 
 
 
 
 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
Similarly, in case reported as “M/s. Awan Industries Ltd. v. The 
Executive Engineer, Lined Channel Division and another.” (1992 
SCMR 65), it has been observed as under: 
“17……the court has power under section 17 of the 
Act to set it aside without waiting for an objection to 
award being filed or without considering any 
application for setting it aside, if there be any, 
irrespective of the question whether or not any 
objection to the award was filed or whether the 
objection, if filed, was not within time.” 
Law laid down in case of M/s. Awan Industries Ltd., supra was 
followed by the Supreme Court in case reported as “A. Qutbuddin 
Khan v. Chec Milliwala Dredging Co. (Pvt.) Ltd., (2014 SCMR 1268). 
9. 
The preceding discussion leads to an ineluctable conclusion that 
once the award is before the Court, it is the duty of the Court to 
scrutinize the award, which is independent of the fact whether any side 
has objected to the same or not or the application of one of the parties 
to arbitration proceedings is time barred. In present case, the Trial 
Court discharged that duty and passed the decree on the basis of the 
award in favour of the petitioner whereas the Appellate Court has 
upended the said findings without touching the merits of the case by 
merely holding that the application of the petitioner to make the award 
a Rule of Court was time barred which in-fact was not as examined 
hereinabove, and hence, the finding of the Appellate Court below is 
erroneous and not sustainable.  

9 
C.R. No.931-D of 2018 
 
 
10. 
Therefore, without touching the merits of the case, lest it may 
prejudice the case of either side, the present petition is allowed and the 
impugned judgment rendered by the Appellate Court below is set aside. 
As a corollary, the appeal of the respondent shall be deemed to be 
pending, which shall be decided on its merits after extending an 
opportunity of hearing to the parties. It is expected that the matter will 
be decided, expeditiously, preferably within a period of 02-months 
from the receipt of certified copy of this judgment. No order as to 
costs.
