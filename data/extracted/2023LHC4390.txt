petitioner.  
Mr. Zafar Iqbal Somro, Assistant District Public 
Prosecutor with Muhammad Jameel, ASI.   
 
 
 
By virtue of instant petition filed under Section 498 
Cr.P.C., petitioner Muhammad Moosa has sought pre-arrest 
bail in case FIR No. 387/2018 dated 20.11.2018, in respect 
of offences under Sections 447, 511, 506-B, 148, 149, PPC 
registered at Police Station Shedani Sharif, District 
Rahimyar Khan. 
2. 
Tersely, the facts of the case culled from the contents 
of first information report are that complainant was resident 
of mauza Ghaus Abad and cultivator by profession. On 
12.11.2018 at 08.00/09.00 p.m. the complainant received 
phone call that the petitioner and his co-accused while armed 
with weapons tried to get forcible possession of his 
agricultural land, upon which, the complainant rushed 
towards the place of occurrence and tried to stop the accused 
party. The accused party while aiming their respective 
weapons towards the complainant party stated that if 
somebody come near them, will be done to death and 

Crl.Misc.No. 2163-B of 2023

thereafter while extending threats of dire consequences, 
decamped from the spot.   Hence, this case.        
3. 
I have heard learned counsel for the petitioner as well 
as learned Assistant District Public Prosecutor meticulously 
and scanned the record minutely.     
4. 
Facts in short which constrained the petitioner to file 
instant petition under section 498, Cr.P.C. before this Court 
are that the petitioner applied bail before arrest which was 
confirmed from the court of learned Additional Sessions 
Judge, Liaqatpur, District Rahimyar Khan vide order dated 
10.01.2019. Subsequently, after completion of investigation, 
report under section 173, Cr.P.C. was submitted before the 
court of learned Magistrate Tehsil Liaqatpur, District 
Rahimyar Khan. After observing all pre-trial Codal 
formalities learned trial court framed the charge against the 
petitioner and his co-accused on 11.06.2019 but the 
petitioner subsequently absented himself from the learned 
trial court whereupon his non-bailable warrants of arrest 
were issued and ultimately he was declared Proclaimed 
Offender in accordance with law on 25.09.2021. The order 
dated 25.09.2021 passed by learned trial court is hereby 
reproduced as under:- 
 
“In the light of above recorded statement of 
the process server, proclamations u/s 87, 
Cr.P.C. were duly served upon the accused 
Muhammad Mosa But the accused has not 
put his appearance before the court within 
prescribed period, therefore, the accused is 
declared as proclaimed offender in the case in 
hand. Perpetual non-bailable warrants of 
arrest of the accused be issued which shall 
remain operative till arrest of the accused. 
Ahlmad is directed to get entered the 

Crl.Misc.No. 2163-B of 2023  
3 
perpetual non-bailable warrants of arrest in 
the relevant register and deliver the same to 
Naib Court. The bail bonds of accused are 
confiscated in favour of the State. Separate 
proceedings against the surety of accused 
person be initiated u/s 514. Cr.P.C. Trial of 
accused Muhammad Mosa is hereby separated 
from other accused persons. Now to come for 
arguments on the application for alteration of 
charge on 03.11.2021.  
 
5. 
Thereafter, the petitioner again applied bail before 
arrest which was heard and decided by learned Additional 
Sessions 
Judge, 
Liaqatpur 
and 
petitioner’s 
second 
application under section 498, Cr.P.C. was also confirmed 
vide order dated 13.12.2021 with the direction to furnish 
fresh surety bond in the sum of Rs. 50,000/- with one surety 
in the like amount to the satisfaction of the learned trial court 
within three days. The petitioner/ accused was also directed 
to appear before the learned trial court and join the 
proceedings of the trial as per law and if the petitioner will 
not join the proceedings of the challan and furnish fresh 
surety bond then law will take its due course.  
 I have observed that in spite of obeying the supra 
mentioned directions issued by the Court of learned 
Additional Sessions Judge, Liaqatpur, the petitioner again 
remained away from the process of law and lastly filed 3rd 
application under section 498, Cr.P.C. before the court of 
learned Additional Sessions Judge, Liaqatpur on 15.05.2023 
which was dismissed vide order dated 17.05.2023. Hence, 
this petition before this Court.

6. 
After hearing the arguments of both sides some legal 
questions have arisen from the facts and circumstances of the 
case which are mentioned below:-  
i) 
Whether 2nd and 3rd petitions under 
sections 498, Cr.P.C. before the Sessions 
Court 
were 
competent 
after 
the 
confirmation of 1st bail before arrest on 
merits? 
 
ii) 
Whether order dated 25.09.2021 passed 
by 
learned 
Magistrate 
Section 
30, 
Liaqatpur with respect to issuance of 
non-bailable warrants of arrest and 
declaring 
the 
petitioner 
Proclaimed 
Offender was not revisable?  
 
iii) 
Whether bail granted by the higher forum 
can be recalled by the fora below? 
 
 
 
iv) 
Whether 
issuance 
of 
non-bailable 
warrants of arrest by the learned trial 
court 
would 
not 
tantamount 
to 
cancellation of bail of the petitioner? 
 
iv) 
Whether 
issuance 
of 
non-bailable 
warrants of arrest or cancellation of bail 
order under section 497(5), Cr,P.C. are 
not revisable orders?   
  
 
 
To decide the above mentioned questions of law it 
would be appropriate to have a glance over the provisions of 
sections 498, 497(5), 439 and 439-A, Cr.P.C. which are 
hereby reproduced for facilitation   
   
498. Power to direct admission to bail or

shall not be so released if there appear reasonable 
grounds for believing that he has been guilty of

or

and

(3) Where the sentence dealt with under this 
section has been passed by a Magistrate the

(2) An Additional Sessions Judge shall have and 
may exercise all the powers of a Sessions Judge 
under this Chapter in respect of any case which 
may be transferred to him under any general or 
special order of the Sessions Judge. 
 
The record reflects that petitioner’s first application for grant 
of bail before arrest was confirmed from the court of learned 
Additional Sessions Judge, Liaqatpur vide order dated 10.01.2019 

Crl.Misc.No. 2163-B of 2023  
7 
on merits and his subsequent two other bail applications filed under 
section 498, Cr.P.C. before the court of learned Additional Sessions 
Judge, Liaqatpur were not competent. It may not be out of place to 
mention here that order dated 25.09.2021 passed by the learned 
Magistrate Section 30, Liaqatpur qua issuance of non-bailable 
warrants of arrest and declaring the petitioner proclaimed offender 
was a revisable order in the light of section 439-A, Cr.P.C. and the 
above mentioned order cannot be set aside by the Sessions Court 
while exercising its powers under section 498, Cr.P.C.  
 
7. 
Insofar as the contention of learned counsel for the petitioner 
that pre-arrest bail confirmed by the learned Additional Sessions 
Judge cannot be cancelled by the learned Magistrate section 30 is 
concerned, it is an admitted fact that the learned Magistrate section 
30 cannot cancel the bail granted by the higher forum, however, 
can issue non-bailable warrants of arrest of the accused and 
production of accused before him besides proceeding against surety 
under section 514, Cr.P.C. Reliance is placed upon the following 
case laws tilted as Bahadur Ali vs. The State (1968 P.Cr.L.J. 
1138), Ali vs. The State (PLD 1980 Karachi 303), Manzoor 
Ahmad Bhatti vs. The State (1985 P.Cr.L.J. 1558), Ghulam 
Sarwar vs. The State 1988 MLD 2021) and  Muhammad Ashraf 
alias Moni vs. The State and another (2013 P.Cr.L.J. 1445). I 
have observed that in the instant case the learned Magistrate has 
not cancelled the bail of the petitioner, though he has issued his 
non-bailable warrants of arrest and thereafter declared him as 
proclaimed offender in accordance with law.    
 
8. 
 Taking this case from the other angle that issuance of non-
bailable warrants of arrest would tantamount to cancellation of bail 
in the light of case laws Yousaf Masih vs. The State (1987 

Crl.Misc.No. 2163-B of 2023  
8 
P.Cr.L.J 1412) and Fawad Ali vs. The State and others (2019 
SCMR 1641) wherein it has been held by the apex Court as under:- 
“During the pendency of the proceedings before the High 
Court the private respondents in these petitions had failed to 
appear and resultantly non-bailable warrants for their arrest 
had been issued which could not be executed. The law 
already stands settled that if an accused person admitted to 
bail is subsequently declared a Proclaimed Offender or non-
bailable warrants for his arrest are issued then such 
declaration or issuance of non-bailable warrants ipso facto 
amounts to cancellation of that accused person’s bail”.  
 
 
It has been well settled by now that if any bail order is recalled 
under section 497(5), Cr.P.C. and against cancellation/recalling of 
bail order remedy under section 498, Cr.P.C. is not competent 
because the same is also revisable order. Reliance is placed upon 
the case laws tilted as Muhammad Malik Pervaiz vs. The State 
(1968 P.Cr.L.J. 196), Haji Behram Khan vs. Akhtar Muhammad 
and 7 others (1993 P.Cr.L.J. 71) and Raja Sajjad Hussain vs. The 
State and another (2017 P.Cr.L.J. 1513).  For 
the 
foregoing 
reasons, I am quite confident to hold that in both situations, i.e. 
issuance of non-bailable warrants of arrest or cancellation of bail 
under section 497(5), Cr.P.C. revision is competent and same 
cannot be challenged through a petition under section 498, Cr.P.C.  
 
9. 
Another intriguing aspect of this case which cannot be lost 
sight of is that the petitioner is avoiding process of law since 
25.09.2021 and it has been well settled proposition of law that 
noticeable absconscion loses some of normal rights guaranteed 
under the law, as observed in the cases titled as Alamzaib vs. Haji 
Muhammad Ramzan and another  (2000 MLD 1718) and Zahoor 
Khan vs. Akhtar Muhammad and another (2020 SCMR 993).   
 
10. 
Another crippling feature of this case which cannot be 
ignored is that after confirmation of 2nd bail before arrest vide order 

Crl.Misc.No. 2163-B of 2023  
9 
dated 13.12.2021 passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, 
Liaqatpur the petitioner had not submitted fresh bail bonds within 
three days by surrendering himself before the learned trial court 
which clearly manifests that the petitioner is playing hide and seek 
with the courts on one pretext or the other. In the peculiar 
circumstances of this case, I am of the view that the petitioner is 
not entitled for any concession because the Hon’ble Supreme Court 
of Pakistan has deprecated this practice. Wisdom is derived from 
the case laws titled as Muhammad Sadiq and others vs. The State 
and another (2015 SCMR 1394) and Mukhtar Ahmad vs. The 
State and others (2016 SCMR 2064).   
 
11. 
Aftermath of the above said discussion is that instant petition 
has no force and the same is hereby dismissed
