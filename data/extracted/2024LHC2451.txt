General.

Advocates General, Punjab.

Respondents No.

M/s Riaz Ahmad Kharal and Muhammad 
Waqas, Advocates alongwith respondent 
No.2 and the minor boy. 
 
 
Anwaar Hussain J:  By way of factual background, it has been 
noted that the petitioner was married to one Imtiaz Bhatti from whose 
wedlock two children were born. The issue in the present petition 
relates and is confined to the custody of the minor boy namely, 
Muhammad Daniyal (“minor boy”). The other child is the minor girl 
namely, Muskan (“minor girl”). Both the minor boy and the minor 
girl are hereinafter collectively referred to as “the minors”. The 
socio-psychological ordeal of the minors in general and the minor boy 
in particular finds its genesis and commenced when the father of the 

 
 
2 
W.P No.3513/2023 
minors was murdered. The minors have lost their father to a crime and 
their misfortune had worsened, as the petitioner who is their mother, 
was arrested as a co-accused in the said criminal case. The petitioner 
was arrested and the minor girl aged 05-years at that time was left to 
spend her infancy/childhood with the petitioner, in jail, until the 
petitioner was released on bail whereas the minor boy was kept by 
respondent 
No.2/the 
paternal 
grandmother 
(“respondent 
grandmother”). The petitioner after her release on bail, approached 
this Court by filing habeas petition, for recovery of the minor boy, 
which was admittedly dismissed by this Court primarily, on the basis 
that the respondent grandmother had obtained an injunctive order 
from the Guardian Court, Okara in an application for appointment of 
guardian of the minor boy and order of this Court was upheld by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan. It was left to the wisdom of the Guardian 
Court to decide the issue of guardianship of the minor boy. The 
petitioner then approached the Guardian Court concerned with an 
application for custody of the minor boy and also contested pending 
guardian petition filed by the respondent grandmother. The Trial 
Court allowed custody petition of the petitioner and dismissed the 
guardian petition of the respondent grandmother, however, the 
Appellate Court below, vide impugned judgment dated 08.12.2022 
has upended the said decision of the Trial Court on the ground that the 
petitioner is accused of murder of her husband-father of the minors 
and hence, it is not in the welfare of the minor boy to appoint the 
petitioner as his guardian. Hence, the present petition.  
2. 
An attempt, at the outset, was made today by vice counsel  of 
Sardar Khurram Latif Khosa, Advocate with request to submit power 
of attorney executed by respondents No.2 and 3, while superseding 
Rai Riaz Ahmad Kharal, Advocate, without obtaining NOC  from the 
latter, who represents respondents No.2 and 3. The latter confirms this 
fact. It is also observed that Rai Riaz Ahmad Kharal, Advocate 

 
 
3 
W.P No.3513/2023 
himself had superseded another counsel namely, Sheikh Saeed 
Ahmad, Advocate with the averments that the matter was earlier being 
dealt with by erstwhile counsel whose ill-advice has made respondent 
grandmother and respondent No.3 to become fugitive from the Court 
and they had disappeared along with the minor boy and the said 
Sheikh Saeed Ahmad, Advocate then ceased to appear in this case. 
The attempt on behalf of respondent grandmother and respondent 
No.3 to engage another counsel who not even bothered to appear 
today to argue the matter and has deputed an associate form his office 
is deprecated and the power of attorney is not taken on record. It is 
imperative to state that this case has been heard on multiple dates so 
as to assess and ascertain the welfare of the minor boy, under peculiar 
facts and circumstances of the case.  
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the Appellate 
Court below decided the matter on the basis of the assumption that 
welfare of the minor boy does not lie with the petitioner as the latter 
has been charged with accusation of facilitating murder of her 
deceased husband, which is misconceived as the petitioner is merely 
an accused at the moment and depriving a child from the love of the 
mother, on the basis of mere accusation is prima facie an erroneous 
decision. It is the case of the petitioner that she is the natural guardian, 
and it is settled principle of law that minor’s welfare is best secured in 
the hands of the mother and not the respondent grandmother who has 
conflict of interest qua the property of the minors. Conversely, it is 
case of the respondent grandmother that the petitioner is accused of 
committing murder of her deceased husband/father of the minors, 
therefore, preference should be given to the paternal relatives in 
general and the respondent grandmother in particular, which aspect 
has been correctly appreciated by the Appellate Court below. On a 
pointed question as to that if she had love and affection for the 
children of her deceased son, why the respondent grandmother was 

 
 
4 
W.P No.3513/2023 
not conscious of wellbeing of the minor girl (her real grand-daughter), 
at the time when she approached the Trial Court, by filing the 
guardian petition in respect of the minor boy, no plausible explanation 
could be extended. However, learned counsel for the respondent states 
that petition for guardianship of the minor daughter has been also filed 
on 25.01.2023 and is pending adjudication and seeks permission to 
submit certified copy of the same, which is taken on record as Mark 
‘B’. Adds that this Court has limited scope to review the decision of 
Appellate Court below in respect of welfare of the minor.  
4. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
5. 
While appointing a guardian and/or granting custody of a 
minor, the Courts are always obligated to consider a number of factors 
and is to be guided by the same as laid down in Section 17 of the 
Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 (“Act”). However, the same are 
neither conclusive nor exhaustive for the determination as the 
overarching and pivotal consideration is always the welfare of the 
minor.  
6. 
A minor of very young age, like the minors in the present case, 
ought to be with their mother in ordinary circumstances, as it is the 
mother in whose hands a child’s welfare is best secured and her lap is 
considered as heavenly abode. However, as stated above, it is trite and 
well-established principle that in deciding about a minor’s custody or 
his/her guardianship, the welfare of the minor is of paramount 
consideration. This principle is embodied under Section 17 of the Act. 
The word “ordinarily” has much significance. It takes into account the 
circumstances that could be emergent in a case where the mother 
might be disqualified to hold a minor’s custody. There could be cases 
where the minor’s welfare may not be best secured in the mother’s 
hand. Certainly, such circumstances disentitling her from custody/ 
guardianship would have to be clearly pleaded and undisputedly 

 
 
5 
W.P No.3513/2023 
proved. These could be, the mother being physically or mentally 
incapacitated, or demonstrably living in circumstances where the 
minors’ welfare - physical, mental and psychological, would not be 
secure, or accused of a crime involving moral turpitude, that would 
impact the minor’s welfare.  
7. 
One of the matters which is required to be considered by a 
Court of law is the “character” of the proposed guardian. Thus, a 
complaint against the petitioner alleging and attributing the murder of 
the father of the minors is indeed a relevant factor while deciding the 
custody of the minor boy in favour of such a person. On the facts and 
in the circumstances of the case, both the Courts were duty-bound to 
consider the allegations against the petitioner and pendency of the 
criminal case regarding murder of the spouse, as also the dispute 
related to the property of the minors. 
8. 
As welfare of a minor is a social aspect to be determined and 
measured with reference to his own distinct social milieu and frame of 
reference, the same becomes an objective assessment on the basis of 
subjective material of each case available before the Court. Thus, the 
factual aspect of a mother having been accused of murder of her 
husband-father of the minor(s) would always weigh heavily with the 
Court in appointing guardian and granting custody of the minor to the 
said mother but the same cannot be considered as conclusive factor as 
it is only a measure and mean to determine the ultimate aim of welfare 
of minor. There might be other factors which outweigh the mother 
being accused of murder in the overall determination of welfare of 
minor.  Before answering the fundamental question as to whether a 
child’s custody could be entrusted to the accused-the petitioner so 
long as her guilt or innocence is not determined, it is imperative to 
analyze the chain of events that took place after filing of the present 
petition.

9. 
After issuance of notice and appearance of the parties, the 
parties were asked to produce the minors before this Court through 
order dated 27.09.2023. While the petitioner produced the minor girl 
before this Court, the respondent grandmother along with other 
respondents kept on lingering the matter on one pretext or the other. 
On 07.11.2023, learned Law Officer was directed to ensure that the 
respondents are intimated through law enforcing agencies that the 
minor boy shall be produced on the next date of hearing. Respondent 
No.4 namely, Muhammad Munir, who is real paternal uncle of the 
minor boy tendered appearance on 07.11.2023 and submitted that the 
custody of the minor is with respondent No.3 who is paternal aunt of 
the minor boy and submitted that he has no objection viz-a-viz the 
grant of custody of the minor boy to the petitioner. On 15.11.2023, 
Station House Officer, Police Station Mandi Ahmadabad appeared 
and submitted that he has raided the house of the respondents 
(respondent 
grandmother 
and 
paternal 
aunt, 
namely, 
Azra 
Bibi/respondent No.3), however, they are not residing at the given 
address. When confronted with the sorry state of affairs qua the 
conduct of the said respondents who were retaining custody of the 
minor boy, Sheikh Saeed Ahmad, Advocate who was representing the 
said respondents (including grandmother), submitted that he has also 
tried to reach out to the respondents but remained unsuccessful. The 
SHO who was in attendance was directed to ensure the recovery and 
production of the minor boy before this Court on the next date of 
hearing. On failure of SHO to trace out the respondents having 
custody of the minor boy, District Police Officer, Okara was directed 
to appear in person. Thereafter, on 28.11.2023, Sheikh Saeed Ahmad, 
Advocate again submitted that he has been trying hard to reach out his 
clients but has remained unsuccessful, therefore, he will be filing an 
application for withdrawal of his power of attorney. Mansoor Amaan, 
District Police Officer, Okara appeared and stated that despite hectic 

 
 
7 
W.P No.3513/2023 
efforts the minor boy could not be traced out. On Court’s query, the 
official in attendance stated that there is piece of land vesting in the 
name of the minor boy, which is being cultivated by the lessee of the 
respondents, including respondent grandmother and perhaps the same 
is the reason as also the bone of contention between the parties. The 
Revenue Officials concerned were directed not to create any third-
party interest in respect of the property of the minor boy and it was 
directed that the lessee cultivating the land be also intimated and 
directed to appear on the next date of hearing. On 29.11.2023, when 
the case was called, at the outset, one Mian Mazhar Hussain, 
Advocate appeared and stated that he represents one Mian Asif 
Shakir, Advocate (“the lessee”), who is the lessee of the property. He 
submitted that the lessee is a practicing advocate and was last 
contacted by the respondent grandmother and respondent No. 3, 
telephonically, on 13.11.2023 whereafter the said respondents were 
not in touch with the lessee. The Police Officials also verified this fact 
on the basis of CDR that the last call from the cell number of the 
respondent grandmother was made to the lessee, on the said date 
whereafter the former switched off her cell phone. Mian Mazhar 
Hussain, Advocate, also contended that the police officials have acted 
illegally and improperly by harassing the family of the lessee just to 
know the whereabouts of the respondents; that the lessee entered into 
the lease agreement, in respect of the land, in accordance with law and 
sought permission to submit copy of the lease agreement, which was 
taken on record as Mark ‘A’. Perusal of lease agreement depicts that 
an amount of Rs.9,112,500/- has been purportedly paid in cash by the 
lessee to the respondent grandmother and respondent No. 3. It does 
not find mention in the lease agreement that the respondents acted as 
guardian of the minor boy and the lease money was received for his 
benefit. When confronted, learned counsel for the lessee asserted that 
there is litigation between the respondents and the minor boy qua the 

 
 
8 
W.P No.3513/2023 
ownership of part of the lease property as the said property was owned 
by the grandfather of the minor boy (husband of respondent No.2/ 
grandmother and father of respondent No. 3) who made a gift of the 
same and the said gift has been disputed and challenged. It is worth 
mentioning that the respondent grandmother was only appointed as 
guardian of person of the minor boy and not guardian of the property. 
It was evident from the above-mentioned facts that, prima facie, the 
minor boy, in whom valuable immovable property vests, had been 
hard done out of the motivation to grab his property, which raised 
serious concerns and apprehensions as to the security and safety of the 
minor boy and therefore, the Police Officials were directed to ensure 
production of the minor boy, on the next date of hearing, and while 
proceeding so, they were directed not to exceed the legal limits and 
cause unjust harassment to any individual and matter was adjourned to 
07.12.2023, where-after more time was sought by Police Officials 
when case was taken up on 13.12.2023. However, the case was not 
fixed thereafter until 02.05.2024, when the minor boy, was produced 
before this Court by the hectic efforts on part of the Police 
Department, which were appreciated. On the said date, the 
respondents were accompanied by Mr. Rai Ahmed Kharal, Advocate, 
who stated that he has been recently engaged as the previous counsel 
for the private respondents was not appearing on their behalf. Learned 
Counsel for the respondent grandmother candidly conceded that she 
was avoiding appearance albeit on account of ill-advice by the former 
counsel and it was observed even the ill-advice on part of the counsel 
does not warrant disobedience of orders of the Court and to flee the 
Courts of law with  the minor boy. On a pointed question as to 
whether the lease of land, was executed in favour of lessee, on 
instructions, it has been acknowledged that the land was given on 
lease, however, the lease amount was not fully paid by the lessee to 
the respondents.

W.P No.3513/2023 
10. 
The above resume of the chain of events that took place after of 
the filing of the present petition has to be put in juxtaposition with the 
fundamental question as to whether the petitioner, who is accused of 
murder of the father of the minor boy can be entrusted with the 
guardianship of the latter. On the one hand is the mother, accused of 
charge of committing murder of her husband, and on the other hand is 
the respondent grandmother along with paternal aunt/respondent No.3 
have adverse interest regarding the property vested in the minor and 
their conduct before this Court whereby they willfully disobeyed the 
orders of this Court to appear and produce the minor boy coupled with 
the fact that they leased out the property of the minor without being 
appointed as guardian of the property. At this juncture, it is imperative 
to note that while both sides as also the Police Officials have not 
given the exact mode through which the lease land has been vested 
with the minor till date, only today it transpired that the said land and 
other property was originally owned by grandfather of the minors who 
gifted the same to his sons that includes deceased father of the minors. 
One of the paternal aunt of the minors, namely, Kauser Bibi has laid 
challenge to the said gift and the respondent grandmother has not 
clearly denied the claim of said Kauser Bibi although respondent 
grandmother is dealing with the property, inter alia, vesting with the 
minor boy after demise of his father, without being appointed as 
guardian of the property.   
11. 
The present case reflects that the principle of welfare of a minor 
cannot be considered in absolute terms rather the same is a relative 
consideration and, at times, the same may have to be seen and 
considered through the prism of what is least detrimental for the 
minor, which implies that the Court may have to select a guardian out 
of the rival contestants who is least detrimental to the upbringing and 
welfare of the minor. In the present case, the fundamental question 
which requires adjudication by this Court is to determine the 

 
 
10 
W.P No.3513/2023 
appointment of guardian of a minor between a mother who is accused 
of murder of her husband and father of the minor, and the paternal 
grandmother of the minor boy who has been dealing with the property 
of the minors without being appointed as the guardian thereof.  
12. 
Thus, this Court is to consider the welfare of the minor boy by 
juxta-positional and parallel analysis of an accused mother and 
respondent grandmother who has acted in a manner which caused 
great concern to this Court as to the safety of person and property of 
minor boy. It is well evident that in the garb of appointment as 
guardian of person of the minor boy, his property has been dealt with, 
to the detriment of the minor boy. Perusal of the lease agreement 
(Mark ‘A’) reveals that the same was executed on 23.10.2023, well 
after filing of the present petition and the respondent grandmother and 
respondent No. 3 were served and, on their behalf, adjournments were 
solicited on one pretext or the other. On a pointed question, as to why 
the respondent grandmother along with respondent No.3 gave away 
the valuable property of the minors, on lease to lessee who is statedly 
a near relative as well and a lawyer by profession, without seeking 
appointment of guardian of the property, there was no plausible 
explanation available with the learned counsel for the respondent 
grandmother. 
13. 
It is noted that while the Trial Court did not address the effect 
of registration of criminal case against the petitioner altogether, the 
Appellate Court below was so swayed away with the said aspect of 
the matter that it overlooked and swept aside all other aspects such as 
the conflict of interest of the proposed guardian (the respondent 
grandmother in present case). Another fundamental aspect which was 
overlooked by the Appellate Court below was that the minor girl was 
also daughter of the deceased son of respondent grandmother but not 
only that her custody and/or guardianship was never sought from the 

 
 
11 
W.P No.3513/2023 
Court when guardian petition for custody of the minor boy was filed, 
rather, she was left to be brought up in an adverse atmosphere 
amongst the prisoners jailed with the petitioner/mother. Similarly, 
while seeking the guardianship of the minor boy, the respondent 
grandmother never made any effort to bring up siblings in the 
company of each other whereas it is right of both the siblings to be 
brought up together and spend childhood in each other’s company. 
Question arises that if the respondent grandmother was so concerned 
about the welfare of the minor boy, what prevented her from 
approaching the Court of competent jurisdiction to seek guardianship 
of her granddaughter-the minor girl. The application for guardianship 
of the minor girl has been filed on 25.01.2023, when the present 
petition had already been filed and admitted to regular hearing on 
19.01.2023. It is perhaps the property of the minors and not the minor 
by himself which has made everyone to plead for his custody/ 
guardianship. Even the lessee and the respondent grandmother 
pleaded adverse positions before this Court regarding the lease 
amount as the counsel who appeared on behalf of lessee stated that the 
respondent grandmother and respondent No. 3 have been given the 
entire leased amount for a period of 03 years in advance to the tune of 
Rs. 9,112,500/-, whereas the respondents stated that the entire amount 
has not been paid. This factum alone indicates that the welfare of the 
minor boy, at least his financial and economic interest are neither safe 
nor being carried out in good faith, and this Court apprehends that the 
appointment of the respondent grandmother as guardian would put the 
person of the minor at peril as well. It is also worth mentioning that 
the respondent grandmother acted without good faith as she concealed 
factum of filing of the petition at Pakpattan, and approached the 
Guardian Court, Okara. When confronted with, learned counsel for 
respondent grandmother submits that there was a ‘note’ given at the 
bottom of the second petition and there was no concealment, however, 

 
 
12 
W.P No.3513/2023 
he was asked to read the opening sheet of the second guardianship 
petition, which contemplates otherwise. Relevant column of the 
opening sheet reads as under:  
نہیں

 ۔ آیا کوئی درخواست تقرر ولی عدالت کو پہلے
دی جا چکی ہے اور اس پر کیا نتیجہ ہوا۔ 
 
14. 
The totality of the circumstances on record is to be considered. 
There is no cavil to the preposition that moral and ethical values are 
even more important and essential considerations over physical 
comforts. Had the conduct of the respondent grandmother who was 
appointed as guardian by the Appellate Court below been aboveboard 
while seeking the appointment in general and after the appointment in 
particular, in this case, she could have been preferred by this Court 
over the petitioner until the latter is acquitted of the charge against her 
inasmuch as it does not augur well for the child's welfare, to be placed 
in the custody of a parent, whose fitness to cater to his welfare is in 
doubt on account of accusation of committing murder of the spouse. It 
is admitted feature of the case that the charge against the petitioner is 
one of conspiracy, but true or not, she is accused of her husband’s 
murder, along with a paramour. If the charge is proven to be true, the 
petitioner would not be an ideal person to groom the minors, whose 
welfare not only requires fulfillment of their physical needs, but many 
other things, which includes their moral character. One may argue that 
if the charge was true, the minors’ safety might also be compromised. 
It can also be argued that the petitioner faces a charge about her 
husband’s murder, in relation to which, she is facing trial and there is 
a possibility, remote or not so remote, that she might be convicted and 
sentenced and if that was to happen, while the minors are staying with 
her, it would cause great trauma to the minors, to know that their 
mother, with whom they have bonded and are living, stands convicted 

 
 
13 
W.P No.3513/2023 
of their father’s murder. But equally important is to keep in sight and 
mind that what will happen if the above-mentioned contingency was 
not to come true and the minor boy is handed over to the respondent 
grandmother. In such eventuality, the minor boy, who has already lost 
his father, will be deprived of the love of his mother while he will be 
in the custody of respondent grandmother who in instant case has 
been dealing with property of the minors without authority, in a 
clandestine and suspicious manner. It is certainly a situation which 
ought to be avoided. Even otherwise, the petitioner, at present, is 
merely an accused and it is settled principle of law that an accused is 
the “favourite child of law”, which is the concept based on 
farsightedness and prudence that calls for protecting an innocent 
person from getting punished. In the instant case, it is not just the 
petitioner who will be punished, before the conviction (if awarded) by 
deprivation of custody of her son-the minor boy, but the later who 
along with the minor girl have already lost their father and through the 
impugned decision have been deprived from the love of the mother as 
well. It is worth mentioning that the witness of the respondent-
grandmother, namely Ibrar Ahmad AW-2, appeared during the 
Guardian Court and, while being cross examined, stated that 
respondent No.4, before this Court, namely Munir Ahmad, who is real 
son of respondent grandmother has filed a complaint that it is the 
paternal aunt of the minors (respondent No.3) and her husband who 
has committed murder of his deceased brother-father of the minors. 
AW-2 stated as under:

(Emphasis supplied) 

 
 
14 
W.P No.3513/2023 
The above quoted statement of witness of the respondent grandmother 
in itself indicates that guilt of the petitioner and/or any other family 
member of the deceased is unclear and yet to be determined by the 
Court of competent jurisdiction. The respondent grandmother and 
respondent No.3 are residing together alongwith the minor boy and 
the latter too is accused of the murder of the father of the minors. This 
aspect is equally alarming. 
15. 
Moreover, the conflict of interest of the respondent 
grandmother qua the minors is further evident from the fact that on 
the one hand, paternal aunt of the minor, namely, Kausar Bibi 
challenged the gift of property in favour of deceased father of the 
minor and arrayed the respondent grandmother as defendant and on 
the other hand, the lease agreement (Mark ‘A’) has been jointly 
executed in favour of the lessee, inter alia, by Kausar Bibi and the 
respondent grandmother.  
16. 
There is yet another angle from which this case can be 
examined. While the petitioner and the respondent grandmother 
locked their horns to get the custody of the minor boy, welfare of the 
minor girl was not considered important by the respondent 
grandmother and that deprived the minors to live together as 
admittedly, the minor girl is staying with the mother. The respondent 
grandmother did not show the same love and affection for the minor 
girl, which she has been exhibiting for the minor boy. While 
exercising parens patriae jurisdiction, the inter se, separation of the 
minors is perturbing for this Court. It is not just parents or 
grandparents, who had some rights of custody and/or control over the 
minor children but there are rights of the minors to enjoy each other’s 
company, as siblings. This Court has already opined in case bearing 
Writ Petition No.244677/2018 titled “Imtiaz Hussain Versus District 
Judge etc.” (2023 LHC 6165) that the right of minor siblings to 
develop bond of love and ownness among themselves by remaining 

 
 
15 
W.P No.3513/2023 
united and grow up in the companionship needs to be kept in sight by 
the Guardian Courts to avoid causing additional trauma to the minors 
of facing separation from each other. Therefore, if the respondent 
grandmother is allowed to keep the custody of the minor boy, the 
minors will be deprived of being united that will further add to their 
existing agony of losing father as result of a crime, with the mother as 
an accused thereof.  
17. 
In view of the above discussion, the impugned judgment passed 
by the Appellate Court below is set aside and that of the Trial Court is 
restored. The petitioner is entitled to receive the custody of the minor 
boy within a period of 30 days from today. For this purpose, she is 
directed to appear before the Trial Court on 22.06.2024 alongwith 
copy of this judgment and also tender third party surety bond to the 
tune of Rs.02-million to the satisfaction of the Trial Court before the 
custody of the minor boy is handed over to her. Respondent 
grandmother is also directed to produce the minor boy on 22.06.2024. 
The visitation schedule chalked out in favour of the petitioner by 
Appellate Court below will mutatis mutandis apply in favour of the 
respondent grandmother. Before parting with, it is observed that the 
respondent grandmother would be entitled to file fresh petition for 
custody and guardianship, as the case may be, if the petitioner mother 
is proved to be guilty and is convicted for the offence charged.
