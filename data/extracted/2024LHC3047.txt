ALI ZIA BAJWA, J.:- Through this petition filed 
under Section 491 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 (hereinafter 
‘the Code’) the recovery of the alleged detenus, namely Shahzad and 
Asheek, has been sought. It has been asserted that the detenus are 
currently held in illegal and improper custody by the respondent, 
No.2/Station House Officer of Police Station Sundar, Lahore. 
 
2. 
On 07.06.2024 respondent No.2, the Station House Officer 
of Police Station Sundar, Lahore, was directed to present the  

Crl. Misc. No36448-H/2024 
 
(2) 
detenus before the Court on the next scheduled hearing date. On that 
date of hearing, the learned law officer informed the Court that the 
detenus were killed in an alleged police encounter within the territorial 
jurisdiction of Police Station Lytton Road, Lahore. Consequently, FIR 
No. 1042/2024 has been registered under Sections 302, 353, 186, and 
34 of the Pakistan Penal Code, read with Section 13-2(a) of the Punjab 
Arms Ordinance, 1965. The Deputy Inspectors General of Police, 
Operations and Investigation Wing, were summoned to appear with the 
complete case record. Shockingly, the records presented were 
incomplete, due process had not been followed, and mandatory 
procedures were bypassed. Such a dire and distressing state of affairs 
necessitated the summoning of the Provincial Police Officer and the 
Secretary Health, Government of Punjab.

Arguments heard; record perused. 
4. 
 
In this case, the tragic loss of two young men in an 
alleged police encounter under suspicious circumstances has cast a 
long shadow over the entire chain of incidents. The mishandling of 
their bodies and the botched investigation have added fuel to the fire, 
making the entire affair appear highly dubious. It is as if the police 
authorities have opened a Pandora’s box, allowing a cascade of doubts 
and mistrust to spill forth, tarnishing the credibility of the entire 
operation. The incident, shrouded in a fog of uncertainty, called for a 
thorough and transparent inquiry to clear the air and restore faith in 
the criminal justice system. 
5. 
 
Extrajudicial killings are egregious violations of the 
fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973. These heinous acts flagrantly contravene 
the protections guaranteed under Articles 4, 9, 10, 10-A, and 14, 
which collectively uphold the sanctity of life, due process, and human 
dignity. Article 4 asserts the inalienable right of individuals to be 

Crl. Misc. No36448-H/2024 
 
(3) 
treated in accordance with the law, a principle utterly disregarded 
when law enforcement operates outside legal boundaries. Article 9 
enshrines the right to life and liberty, rights that are irrevocably denied 
when individuals are unlawfully deprived of their lives. Article 10 
ensures the right to a fair trial, a cornerstone of justice that is 
completely negated by summary executions. Article 10-A further 
reinforces the right to a fair trial and due process, underscoring the 
necessity of legal proceedings before any punitive measures can be 
taken. Article 14 guarantees the inviolability of the dignity of man, a 
dignity that is irreparably shattered by the brutal and arbitrary nature 
of extrajudicial killings. Extrajudicial killings not only breach these 
fundamental rights but also undermine the very essence of the rule of 
law, casting a shadow over the legitimacy and integrity of the State. 
To preserve the sanctity of the Constitution and the rights it 
guarantees, it is imperative to categorically condemn and eradicate 
such unlawful practices. 
6. 
 
Extrajudicial killings are severe breaches of human rights 
and international law, involving the unlawful execution of individuals 
without due process, often carried out by law enforcement agencies. 
Key international laws addressing this issue include the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, 1948 (UDHR) and the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966 (ICCPR). Article 3 of 
the UDHR and Article 6 of the ICCPR protect the right to life and 
prohibit arbitrary deprivation of life. The United Nations has 
established principles for preventing and investigating extrajudicial 
killings. These include the UN Principles on the Effective Prevention 
and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary, and Summary Executions, 
1989 and the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by 
Law Enforcement Officials, 1990. These legal instruments emphasize 
thorough, prompt, and impartial investigations and the necessity of 
proportional and last-resort use of force by law enforcement. The 
United Nations plays a crucial role in addressing extrajudicial killings 

Crl. Misc. No36448-H/2024 
 
(4) 
through mechanisms like the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary, or arbitrary executions, who investigates and reports on 
such violations. States are obligated to prevent, investigate, and 
punish extrajudicial killings and provide remedies to victims, ensuring 
compliance with international human rights standards. 
7. 
 
The criminal justice system is designed to ensure that 
every individual, regardless of their alleged crimes, is entitled to a fair 
trial. This process is integral to upholding the rule of law, maintaining 
public confidence in justice, and protecting human rights. When 
police officers take the law into their own hands, they corrode this 
trust and subvert the criminal justice system. They assume the roles of 
judge, jury, and executioner, which is anathema to the principles of 
fair trial, governance and justice. 
8. 
 
The assertion that police kill hardened and desperate 
criminals in encounters lacks any legal foundation and fundamentally 
challenges the credibility and effectiveness of the criminal justice 
system. Such an ill-founded rationale is not only legally indefensible 
but also morally reprehensible. By bypassing due process and 
resorting to extrajudicial killings, law enforcement undermines the 
very principles upon which a just society is built. Furthermore, this 
practice casts a long shadow of doubt over the integrity of law 
enforcement agencies. It suggests a lack of faith in the ability of 
criminal justice system to deliver justice and a preference for brute 
force over legal scrutiny. Such actions propagate a dangerous message 
that the State approves lawlessness among its enforcers. This not only 
perpetuates a cycle of violence but also breeds resentment and fear 
within the community. 
9. 
 
The 
sacrifices of law enforcement agencies in 
safeguarding the lives of citizens are nothing short of highly 
commendable and invaluable. These valiant guardians stand as 

Crl. Misc. No36448-H/2024 
 
(5) 
sentinels at the gates, often paying the ultimate price to ensure our 
safety. Their blood becomes the ink with which the story of our 
security and safety is written. Their courage and valour play the role 
of a shield that deflects harm from our doors. Every drop of their 
blood spilled in the line of duty speaks volumes of their dedication 
and the profound cost of our peace. Their sacrifices create a sanctuary, 
allowing us to live our lives without fear. However, under the guise of 
self-defence, fake police encounters cannot be justified. These 
nefarious acts, though perpetrated by a small fraction, cast a long 
shadow over the honour and integrity of entire police department. 
Those who indulge in such nefarious activities must be rooted out 
with steadfast resolve. 
10. 
 
The right of self-defence is a fundamental right bestowed 
upon both individuals and law enforcement alike. For the police, this 
right becomes a vital tool in the discharge of their duties, enabling 
them to protect not only their lives but also the lives of innocent 
civilians. In the realm of law enforcement, the right of self-defence is 
not merely a privilege but a necessity. Police officers frequently find 
themselves in perilous situations where split-second decisions can 
mean the difference between life and death. The law acknowledges 
this harsh reality, permitting the use of force to neutralize threats and 
ensure public safety. Yet, this power must be wielded with utmost 
responsibility and discernment and use of power must be 
proportionate to the threat faced.  
11. 
 
The complex nature of self-defence can sometimes be 
overshadowed by the issue of fake police encounters, leading to 
significant ethical and legal challenges. Striking a balance between the 
legitimate right of self-defence and the prevention of fake encounters 
necessitates a balanced approach. A stringent oversight mechanism 
must be evolved within police department. Independent body in the 
spirit of The Torture and Custodial Death (Prevention and 

Crl. Misc. No36448-H/2024 
 
(6) 
Punishment) Act, 2022 should investigate the incidents where lethal 
force is used, ensuring that each case is meticulously scrutinized and 
that any misuse of power is promptly addressed. Legal framework 
should be fortified to delineate clear boundaries for the use of force. It 
is a settled law that the right of self-defence is contingent upon the 
presence of an immediate and credible threat. Any deviation from this 
standard should be met with severe repercussions, reinforcing the 
message that extrajudicial actions will not be tolerated. 
12. 
 
Training is another cornerstone in this delicate balance. 
Police officers must be rigorously trained not only in tactical response 
but also in de-escalation techniques. Emphasizing the sanctity of life 
and the principles of proportionality and necessity can help prevent 
the knee-jerk resort to lethal force. Officers should be equipped to 
assess threats accurately and respond appropriately, minimizing the 
risk of excessive force. Transparency is also crucial. The public must 
be kept informed about the policies governing the use of force and the 
measures taken to investigate and rectify any abuses. Body cameras 
and other forms of surveillance can serve as impartial witnesses, 
providing clear evidence of the circumstances surrounding each 
encounter. 
13. 
 
In conclusion, the right of self-defence and the scourge of 
fake police encounters present a complex interplay of duty and ethics. 
By developing oversight mechanism, enhancing training, ensuring 
transparency, reinforcing legal standards, and nurturing community 
relations, the fake police encounters can be prevented. This 
equilibrium safeguards the integrity of the criminal justice system, 
affirming that the law, though sometimes wielded in defence, is never 
a tool for extrajudicial retribution. 
14. 
 
The Provincial Police Officer, upon his appearance 
before the Court, unequivocally asserted that the sanctioning of fake 

Crl. Misc. No36448-H/2024 
 
(7) 
police encounters is untenable, as such actions carry with them severe 
penal consequences. His written statement has also been entered into 
the record, reaffirming the assertions he made before the Court. A 
circular dated 12.06.2024 has also been placed on the record issued by 
the Central Police Office, Punjab, Lahore regarding the police 
encounters which has been reproduced hereinafter: - 
 

Crl. Misc. No36448-H/2024 
 
(8) 
 
 
The prompt response of the Provincial Police Officer eloquently reflects his 
genuine intent to curb the abhorrent practice of fake police encounters. 
Through thoughtful reforms and steadfast vigilance, he strives to restore 
sanctity of the criminal justice system and public trust.  
15. 
 
Learned counsel for the petitioner informed the Court that an 
application concerning the allegation of a fake police encounter has been 
submitted to the Federal Investigation Agency for further proceedings 
against the implicated police officials. It is anticipated that the Federal 
Investigation Agency will diligently complete the investigation under the 
supervision of National Commission for Human Rights within the 
stipulated time, adhering strictly to the provisions of The Torture and 
Custodial Death (Prevention and Punishment) Act, 2022. As a clear 
directive has been issued by the Provincial Police Officer, mandating zero 
tolerance for fake police encounters throughout the province, this Court 
hereby disposes of this petition with the expectation that the 
aforementioned circular shall be implemented in its true letter and spirit 
without fail.
