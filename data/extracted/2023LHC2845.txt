    JUDGMENT 
Date of Hearing: 
26.04.2023  
Petitioner by: 
Mr. Abdul Razzaq Younas, Advocate.  
Respondents No.3 
and 4 by: 
Mr. Muhammad Younas Bhullar, Advocate.  
 
 
Anwaar Hussain, J:-  Through this single judgment, the 
present as well as connected constitutional petition bearing W.P. 
No.60517/2022 are intended to be decided by this Court. Respondent 
No.3, namely, Mst. Madiha Kiran has filed the connected constitutional 
petition. Both the petitions have laid challenge to the findings of the 
learned Appellate Court below, rendered in proceedings emanating 
from the suits instituted by respondents No.3 and 4 (respondents No.3 
and 4 are hereinafter collectively referred as „the respondents‟).   
2. 
Briefly stated facts of the case are that the respondents instituted 
three suits. The first suit was for recovery of maintenance allowance 
and delivery expenses whereas the second suit was for recovery of 
dowry articles or in alternate prevailing market price thereof; and the 
third suit was instituted for dissolution of marriage on the ground of 
cruelty alongwith recovery of the dower. Suit to the extent of 
dissolution of marriage became infructuous as during the pendency of 
the third suit, the petitioner divorced respondent No.3. The suits were 
consolidated and issues were accordingly framed. After recording 
evidence led by the parties, the learned Trial Court decreed the suit of 

W.P. No.57778/2022  
 
2
the respondents, vide judgment and decree dated 30.10.2021, in the 
following terms: 
“1. 
The plaintiff No.1 is entitled to recover maintenance 
@ Rs.10,000/- per month from the date of her 
desertion i.e. January, 2018 from the defendant till 
her legal entitlement.  
2. 
The plaintiff No.2/minor is entitled to recover 
maintenance @ Rs.15,000/- per month from his date 
of birth till his legal entitlement with 10% annual 
increment. It is made clear that annual increment 
shall be calculated from 30.10.2022. The interim 
maintenance paid during trial shall be adjusted 
accordingly.  
3. 
Plaintiff is not entitled to recover expenses incurred 
on reception of Barat i.e. Rs.19,52,900/-.  
4. 
Plaintiff is entitled to recover maternity/delivery 
expenses to the tune of Rs.20,000/- from the 
defendant.  
5. 
Plaintiff is not entitled to recover dower amount 
mentioned in column No.13 of Nikahnama.  
6. 
Plaintiff is held entitled to recover dowry articles 
mentioned in Annexure A to Annexure I, from the 
defendant except items mentioned in Annexure-A, 
Annexure B and items mentioned against Sr. No.06 
and 08 in Annexure-E in their existing condition. 
And, in absence of dowry articles, she is entitled to 
recover Rs.1700,000/- as alternate price from the 
defendant.” 
Feeling aggrieved, the respondents preferred appeal, which was 
partially accepted by the learned Additional District Judge, Lahore, 
vide judgment and decree dated 14.07.2022. The judgment and decree 
of the learned Trial Court has been modified and respondent No.3 has 
been held entitled to the recovery of Toyota Corolla GLi, Model 2017 
(hereinafter referred to as „the car‟) or its alternate price i.e., 
Rs.2,285,000/-.  
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner, on instructions, submits that 
he is only challenging the findings of the learned Appellate Court 
below pertaining to the award of the car and does not lay challenge to 

W.P. No.57778/2022  
 
3
the findings of learned Appellate Court below to the extent of 
maintenance, expenses incurred on birth of respondent No.4, dowry 
articles etc. Inter alia, avers that the car does not exist and the 
documents prepared in respect thereof were fictitious. Adds that the car 
was never delivered to the petitioner; that registration book of the car 
was not brought on record; that in criminal case registered in respect of 
the misappropriation of the car, nothing was brought on record to 
indicate that the petitioner was involved in any wrong doing; that 
respondent No.3 is not participating in the trial in respect of the 
criminal case registered regarding the car; and merely on the basis of 
registration of a criminal case, the learned Appellate Court below has 
upset the findings of the learned Trial Court, therefore, the said findings 
are not sustainable.  
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondents submits that the 
petitioner is a practicing doctor and the amount awarded as 
maintenance does not commensurate with the sound financial position 
of the petitioner as well as prevailing inflation rate and therefore, in the 
interest of justice, amount of Rs.25,000/- per month is to be granted, as 
maintenance to the minor/respondent No.4. Adds that para 7 of the 
plaint of the second suit is self-explanatory in which claim regarding 
the giving of car, as well as motorcycle at the time of engagement, has 
been mentioned and that the learned Courts below have erred in not 
awarding the motorcycle inasmuch as any property given in reference 
to a marriage is to be considered as part of the dowry articles. Places 
reliance upon case reported as “Mirza Arshad Baig v. Additional 
District Judge, Multan and others” (2005 SCMR 1740) in support of 
his contentions. Further contends that the alternate value of the car has 
not been properly determined by the learned Appellate Court below and 
draws the attention of this Court to Exh.P-3 and Exh.P-6 in reference to 
the proof of purchase of the car as well as Exh.P-9 regarding the gold 
ornaments. Adds that evidence regarding expenses incurred on the birth 

W.P. No.57778/2022  
 
4
of respondent No.4 has been misread as well. Concludes that brothers 
of the petitioner also acknowledged giving of car as part of the dowry. 
In rebuttal, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that initially, the 
brothers of the petitioner, who persuaded and forced the petitioner to 
enter into marriage with respondent No.3, were arrayed as defendants 
in the suit for recovery of dowry articles but their names were later on 
deleted and hence, any assertion regarding giving of the car in 
affidavits executed by brothers of the petitioner is not of any 
evidentiary value.   
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
6. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner has laid emphasis on a single 
point to refute claim of respondent No.3, regarding the car, in the terms 
that there is no evidence available that the said vehicle was given at the 
time of the marriage as part of the dowry and, merely, on the basis of 
registration of a criminal case by father of respondent No.3 against the 
petitioner for misappropriation, the learned Appellate Court below has 
decreed the suit of respondent No.3 in respect of the car, whereas in 
respect of the same finding, it is the claim of respondent No.3 that 
alternate value of the car has not been properly determined/ascertained 
by the learned Appellate Court below and prayer has been made for 
award of present market value of the car. This Court will first address 
this core issue. Perusal of the record reveals that in her plaint, for 
recovery of dowry articles, in para 7 thereof, respondent No.3 asserted 
the following facts: 
“7. 
That at the time of marriage, a new Toyota Car 
APL4, Auto-GLi, colour white, 1299-CC, bearing Engine 
No.Z500924, Chassis No.NZE170R-4127111, Model 
2017, purchased by the father of the plaintiff from 
TOYOTA JINNAH MOTORS, 23-km Ferozpur Road, 
Lahore against Rs.22,85,000/- along with documents was 
given to plaintiff in dowry but was initially deployed on 
rent by the defendants and then subsequently sold out 
without any intimation.” 

W.P. No.57778/2022

Responding to the said paragraph, the petitioner took the following 
stance in his written statement: 
“6) 
…The vehicle mentioned in this Para was 
purchased with the cash provided by the answering 
defendant. It was also registered in the name of 
defendant in token of acknowledgment of cash provided 
by the defendant.”  
(Emphasis supplied) 
In addition to the fact that respondent No.3 brought on record the sale 
invoice of the car, the above quoted response of the petitioner, in his 
written statement, exhibits an admission on part of the petitioner that 
the car, in-fact, was purchased and transferred in the name of the 
petitioner, at the time of wedding, albeit with cash amount given by the 
petitioner. Even if the stance of the petitioner is accepted that the car 
was purchased with the cash amount given by the petitioner, the same 
has not been proved by the petitioner by leading any evidence. 
Moreover, there is no explanation as to why the petitioner remained 
mum for not demanding the delivery of the car, from the father of 
respondent No.3 for a considerable period of time, when the marriage 
between the parties was subsisting and the relationship was cordial, 
therefore, the assertions of learned counsel for the petitioner that no 
such car was ever purchased or delivered to the petitioner are baseless 
to say the least and hence, discarded. As a natural corollary, the fact 
that the car was not recovered during investigation in the criminal case 
registered by the father of respondent No.3 becomes meaningless as the 
petitioner accepts registration of the case in his name.   
7. 
Adverting to the fact that whether alternate value of the car was 
properly ascertained by the learned Appellate Court below, perusal of 
the impugned judgment reveals that value of the car has been fixed as 
Rs.2,285,000/- that is the amount, which was paid by the father of 
respondent No.3 when the car was booked from M/s Toyota Jinnah 
Motors, in the year 2017, when the marriage of respondent No.3 with 
the petitioner took place. In this regard, it is imperative to note that 

W.P. No.57778/2022

primarily a suit for the return of dowry articles, whenever decided, is 
decreed by the Courts as such with the observation that in case of 
failure, on part of the judgment-debtor, to return the said articles, as an 
alternate, the amount equivalent to the price of dowry articles is 
ordered to be paid and while determining the alternate value of the 
dowry articles, the Courts consider the depreciation of most of the 
dowry articles on account of normal and natural wear and tear thereof 
that takes place over the passage of time since marriage of the parties. 
The rationale underlying the application of principle of depreciation is 
that the dowry articles are to be returned in their current position and if 
the same is not done, their price is to be paid as an alternate and since 
most of the value of dowry articles put to use during the subsistence of 
marriage do undergo depreciation on account of said daily use, 
therefore, while determining the alternate price, it is justifiable that the 
depreciation in value of such articles is to be taken into account. 
However, one cannot lose sight of the fact that there may be some 
articles forming part of the dowry, for instance, the gold ornaments or 
the vehicles or even few electrical appliances etc., value whereof may 
appreciate over the years. The car, in the instant case is such an article. 
Record depicts that giving of the car to respondent No.3, as part of her 
dowry has been established, as discussed hereinabove, and the same 
was registered in the name of the petitioner, at the time of his marriage 
with the former. Therefore, the principle i.e., the dowry article is to be 
returned in its present form, is applicable with respect to the car as well. 
In case of articles such as the car, while determining/ascertaining 
amount of money as an alternate price, the principle of appreciation 
should be kept in mind inasmuch as if the principle of depreciation is to 
be considered with respect to one set of the dowry articles such as 
furniture, etc., which involves depreciation of articles on account of 
wear and tear, the principle of appreciation must also be taken into 
account with respect to such other articles that involves increase in 
value. Failure to do so would not only be iniquitous but would also put 
premium on the unlawful retention of such dowry articles by the 

W.P. No.57778/2022  
 
7
defendant/husband even after the dissolution of marriage or demand for 
return of the same by the plaintiff/wife. Therefore, the learned 
Appellate Court below erred in not considering the appreciation in the 
value of the car while fixing/determining the alternate price thereof 
inasmuch as this is common knowledge that value of Pak Rupees has 
depreciated over the number of years and the value of new as well as 
used vehicles, like the car in instant case, is on continuous rise. 
Therefore, awarding amount spent on purchase of the car in the year 
2017 is not justified and respondent No.3 is entitled to recover the 
market value of the car as on date of realization of the decree. Hence, 
connected constitutional petition bearing W.P. No.60517/2022, filed by 
the respondent, has force to this extent and the findings of the learned 
Appellate Court below merit modification.  
8. 
As regards amount of monthly maintenance awarded, the 
respondents claim that the same should be fixed at the rate of 
Rs.25,000/- per month, per head, till their legal entitlement since the 
petitioner is a practicing doctor. This Court does not find merits in the 
arguments as the amount fixed by the learned Courts below is 
reasonable. Even otherwise, the marriage of the petitioner and 
respondent No.3 has come to an end and as regards maintenance 
awarded to respondent No.4 (the minor), he has been held entitled to 
10% annual increase in maintenance amount of Rs.15,000/- per month 
with effect from 30.10.2022 and, therefore, the said increment caters 
for the growing financial needs of respondent No.4 as well as the rise in 
inflation rate, hence, no interference is required in this regard. 
Similarly, concurrent findings of the learned Courts below, to the 
extent of the remaining dowry articles, are also based on proper 
appreciation of record and no misreading or non-reading could be 
pointed out by learned counsel for the parties in general and learned 
counsel for the respondents in particular. Same is the position with 
respect to findings regarding the delivery charges incurred on birth of 
respondent No.4, expenses incurred on reception of barat and gold 
ornaments given as part of the dower. In addition, as regards gold 

W.P. No.57778/2022  
 
8
ornaments, the learned Appellate Court below has put forth cogent 
reasons while observing that the gold ornaments were given as prompt 
dower and column No.14 of the Nikahnama between the parties clearly 
reflects that the same were paid at the time of solemnization of the 
nikah. Moreover, it is settled principle of law that the gold ornaments 
are always possessed by females unless snatching is not only alleged 
but also proved, which is not the position in the instant case. Therefore, 
respondent No.3 is not entitled to the grant of the gold ornaments. 
Cases titled “Javed Iqbal v. Additional District Judge Faisalabad and 
another” [2017 CLC Note 25 (Lahore)] and “Muhammad Saeed v. 
Additional District Judge and others” [2019 CLC 1008 (Lahore)] are 
referred in this regard. Adverting to the claim of respondent No.3 that a 
motorcycle was given at the time of engagement as gift to the petitioner 
and same also forms part of the dowry articles, needless to mention that 
any gift given to the groom at the time of engagement, cannot be 
treated as part of the dowry as the same is not the property of 
respondent No.3 rather ownership of said motorcycle vests with the 
petitioner. It is imperative to note that dowry is only such articles that 
are given at the time of marriage to the bride and not the gifts to the 
bridegroom at the time of engagement. Therefore, reliance placed by 
learned counsel for the petitioner on case of Mirza Arshad Baig supra 
is misplaced, on account of distinguishable facts.  
9. 
The learned Appellate Court below, after re-appraising the 
evidence on record, has maintained findings of facts to the extent of 
dower, maintenance allowance, motorcycle, expense incurred on birth 
of respondent No.4 and expenditure on reception of barat and has 
modified the finding to the extent of the entitlement of respondent No.3 
to the car given as part of dowry and the same does not merit 
interference. The Supreme Court of Pakistan in case reported as “Mst. 
Farah Naz v. Judge Family Court, Sahiwal and others” (PLD 2006 SC 
457) has held as under: 
“It was none of the business of the High Court in writ 
jurisdiction to substitute its own findings for the findings 

W.P. No.57778/2022  
 
9
recorded by the court of appeal after due appraisal of 
evidence. We would, therefore, set aside the judgment of 
the High Court as well as that of the Family Court 
decreeing the suit in the sum of Rs.4,00,000 and restore 
the judgment of the appellate Court accepting the claim of 
the appellant, as pleaded in the suit.”  
10. 
In view of the above discussion, this Court is of the opinion that 
learned counsel for the petitioner could not point out any misreading or 
non-reading of evidence, jurisdictional defect or procedural impropriety 
in the findings of the learned Courts below in general and the learned 
Appellate Court below in particular, hence, present petition bearing 
W.P. No.57778/2022 is dismissed. Similarly, the prayer of respondent 
No.3 in connected petition, except to the extent of alternate value of the 
car determined by learned Appellate Court below, is also devoid of 
merits and hence, discarded. However, the connected petition bearing 
W.P. No.60517/ 2022 filed by the respondents is disposed of in the 
terms that respondent No.3 is entitled to recover market value of the 
car, from the petitioner, which can be ascertained/determined by the 
learned Executing Court, by having recourse to appointment of local 
commission/car dealers and the judgment of the learned Appellate 
Court below dated 14.07.2022 is accordingly modified.
