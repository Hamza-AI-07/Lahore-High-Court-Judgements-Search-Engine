Date of Hearing:

Petitioners by: 
Rana Saud Jalal, Advocate.  
Respondent No.3 by:  
Ch. Sohail Nasir Mufti, Advocate 
alongwith respondent.   
 
Anwaar Hussain, J. This case has chequered history. The present 
constitutional petition has emanated from the third round of litigation 
between the parties. The contest started when predecessor-in-interest of 
the petitioners, namely, Muhammad Hanif (deceased) filed an eviction 
petition under the Punjab Rented Premises Act, 2009 (“the Act”) 
against respondent No.3, namely, Nasir Mehmood (“the respondent”) 
seeking eviction of the latter, from Shop No.5, situated in Jamia Gali 
No.2, Chiniot Bazar, Faisalabad (“the rented premises”), with the 
averments that the respondent is in occupation of the rented premises 
and has committed default since June, 2018, by not paying monthly rent 
of Rs.30,000/-. It was further averred that the tenancy was created 
between the respondent and deceased brother of the petitioner, namely, 
Muhammad Dilawar and after the death of said Muhammad Dilawar, 
predecessor of the petitioners, used to receive the rent in respect of 
which the respondent has committed wilful default, and despite repeated 
requests, the respondent failed to execute formal written tenancy with 
predecessor of the petitioners.   
2. In the first round of litigation, the leave to appear and contest filed 
by the respondent, under the Act, was declined, vide order dated 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 19794/2023                                                                                          2 
 
 
16.05.2019, however, in appeal preferred by the respondent, the matter 
was remanded to the Rent Tribunal for decision afresh. In his leave to 
appear and contest, the respondent asserted that the tenancy is perpetual 
as he was put into possession of the rented premises by one Muhammad 
Ashraf s/o Sheikh Muhammad Hussain, who was the ex-tenant, in the 
rented premises, with the consent of brother of predecessor of the 
petitioners, namely, Muhammad Babar Bilal and an amount of 
Rs.2,625,000/- was paid to said ex-tenant as pagri in terms of an 
agreement dated 09.06.2008 (“the pagri agreement”) which was also 
endorsed by the said Muhammad Babar Bilal, where-after a tenancy 
agreement dated 27.08.2008 (“the tenancy agreement”) was executed 
between Muhammad Babar Bilal and the respondent and the latter 
continued to pay rent to the former before he died and after his death, 
rent was received by Muhammad Dilawar referred above and upon the 
demise of Muhammad Dilawar, rent was paid to predecessor of the 
petitioners namely, Muhammad Hanif, at the rate of Rs. 18,000/- and 
not Rs. 30,000/-. It was also pleaded that the respondent is not a 
defaulter and it is Muhammad Hanif who refused to receive the monthly 
rent in June, 2018. 
3. Issues were framed and after recording of the evidence, the eviction 
petition was accepted, vide order dated 25.05.2021. However, when the 
appeal was preferred by the respondent, the matter was again remanded 
vide order dated 28.03.2022, by the Appellate Court below, to the Rent 
Tribunal to decide the same afresh with the observations that issue No.3 
pertaining to status of tenancy relationship between the parties was not 
correctly decided as also no finding was given on issue No.5 pertaining 
to blackmailing of the ejectment petitioner to the respondent to vacate 
the rented premises. 
4. Upon remand, in the third round of litigation, vide order dated 
04.06.2022, the Rent Tribunal again accepted the ejectment petition; 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 19794/2023                                                                                          3 
 
 
declared the respondent as defaulter; and directed the respondent to 
vacate the rented premises within a period of one month while holding 
him entitled to recovery/adjustment of pagri amount of Rs.2,625,000/- 
whereas the petitioners were held entitled to recover arrears of rent at 
the rate of Rs.18,000/- per month from the respondent, and not at the 
rate of Rs.30,000/- per month as prayed for, since June 2018 onwards 
till delivery of possession of the rented premises to them. Feeling 
dissatisfied, both sides preferred appeals and through consolidated 
judgment dated 03.03.2023, the Appellate Court below allowed the 
appeal preferred by the respondent and dismissed the appeal of the 
petitioners with the observation that the respondent is not a wilful 
defaulter. The respondent has been also held entitled to recover the 
amount of pagri. Finding to the extent of eviction was maintained.  
5. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the impugned 
judgment passed by the Appellate Court below is self-contradictory 
inasmuch as on the one hand, the findings to the extent of default have 
been reversed and on the other hand, the petitioners have been directed 
to refund the pagri amount. Adds that the petitioners are not obligated to 
return the amount of pagri, as no such amount was received by them or 
their predecessor (landlord) and the respondent failed to prove the 
execution of the pagri agreement as well as the tenancy agreement. 
Further contends that in the earlier round of litigation, no receipts of 
payment of rent were produced and few of the receipts purportedly 
issued by Muhammad Babar Bilal for the months of September, October 
and November, 2008, brought on record in the second round, contain 
dates which pertain to post-death period of Muhammad Babar Bilal that 
alone negates the stance of the respondent regarding his induction as 
tenant by the deceased Muhammad Babar Bilal and not by the deceased 
Muhammad Dilawar. Therefore, the respondent was defaulter and 
findings of the Appellate Court below in respect of default are 
erroneous.  

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 19794/2023                                                                                          4 
 
 
6. Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent submits that the 
respondent has acted in good faith and has not denied the tenancy 
relationship with the petitioners. Adds that the rented premises was 
jointly owned by three brothers (Muhammad Babar Bilal, Muhammad 
Dilawar and Muhammad Hanif), and the respondent was initially 
inducted therein with consent of one of them (Muhammad Babar Bilal) 
as evident from the pagri agreement read with the tenancy agreement. 
Further contends that no forgery has been committed by the respondent 
as the receipts dated 05.09.2008, 05.10.2008 and 05.11.2008 were 
issued 
by 
Muhammad 
Babar 
Bilal, 
before 
his 
death, 
as 
acknowledgement of advance rent, for initial three months of the 
tenancy, where-after admittedly, Muhammad Dilawar also received the 
rent for a period of more than 10 years and after demise of Muhammad 
Dilawar, predecessor of the petitioners started receiving the same 
without any objection, hence, the same is an acknowledgement of 
creation of tenancy on payment of the pagri in respect of the rented 
premises. Further avers that son of ex-tenant appeared as witness      
who admitted that for vacating the rented premises, and handing over its 
possession to the respondent, an amount of Rs.300,000/- in cash 
alongwith other payment(s) were received by his father from the 
respondent. Adds that the said witness also admitted that a house was 
transferred by the respondent in favour of his father (ex-tenant), 
pursuant to the pagri  agreement. Contends that the pagri agreement 
was also endorsed by deceased Muhammad Babar Bilal who received 
his commission, and the respondent also produced the second marginal 
witness of the said agreement to further substantiate his contention in 
respect of payment of pagri. Adds that the question of default has been 
correctly appreciated by the Appellate Court below as the petitioners 
failed to substantiate that the rent due was Rs.30,000/- per month as on 
June, 2008, and the respondent wilfully defaulted and since the 
respondent was willing to handover the possession of the rented 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 19794/2023                                                                                          5 
 
 
premises to the petitioners upon receipt of the pagri, therefore, the 
impugned findings are result of correct application of law and 
appreciation of facts by the Appellate Court below.  
7. Arguments heard. Record perused.  
8. Admittedly, the tenancy relationship between the parties is not 
disputed and the respondent is willing to handover possession thereof to 
the petitioners. In view of the above referred factual background of the 
case and in the light of arguments of learned counsel for the parties, this 
Court is only required to adjudicate the following issues:  
(i) 
Whether the respondent was able to establish receipt of the 
pagri amount, by predecessor of the petitioners, under the 
pagri agreement? and 
(ii) 
What was the rate of monthly rent in June, 2018 and 
whether the respondent committed any default? 
9. Before addressing the nub of the matter that relates to the return of 
the pagri, this Court would first examine the issue of default. Both the 
Courts below have thrashed the evidence. The Rent Tribunal, through 
impugned order dated 04.06.2022, held as under:  
“10.  As far as the amount of rent Rs.30,000/- per 
month is concerned, the same has been alleged by 
the petitioners. Hence, they were required to 
establish said amount of rent. However, in this 
respect, petitioners have failed to produce cogent 
and convincing evidence. The evidence adduced by 
the petitioners comprises of oral evidence of 
witnesses AW-1 to AW-3. This court is, however, 
of the considered opinion that their statements are 
contradictory to the contents of ejectment petition 
in hand. Hence not reliable. In the instant 
ejectment petition, petitioners have alleged that an 
amount of Rs.30,000/- was paid by respondent to 
the predecessor in interest of petitioners for the 
month of May 2018 and accordingly predecessor 
in interest of petitioners issued him a receipt 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 19794/2023                                                                                          6 
 
 
which was in possession of respondent. However, 
when AWs appeared before the court, they made 
contradictory 
statements 
in 
their 
cross 
examination. Although, in their examination in 
chief, AWs have made the same statement to the 
effect that the receipt of rent was issued by 
predecessor in interest of petitioners. However, in 
their cross examination, AW-1 alleged that on 
07/08 of May 2018 respondent came to their 
house for payment of rent. When he came to their 
house, he also brought with him a receipt 
providing for the payment of rent amounting to 
Rs.30,000/-. The same was signed by his father 
and handed over to respondent. Thereby, he 
himself has negated his version in the ejectment 
petition to the extent of issuance of receipt by his 
predecessor in interest. 
11.  
AW-2 and AW-3 also made contradictory 
statements in this regard. AW-2 submitted that 
they were sitting on the first floor of demised 
premises and respondent came to pay the rent to 
predecessor in interest of petitioners who was also 
sitting with them and in their presence, the rent 
was paid. However, AW-1 and AW-3 submitted 
that the amount of rent was paid by respondent to 
predecessor in interest of petitioners while 
standing on the stairs. Thereby, the version of 
petitioner regarding the payment of rent 
amounting to Rs.30,000/- is highly unbelievable. 
There is no documentary evidence in this regard 
and the oral evidence adduced by the petitioners 
is highly doubtful.” 
 
  
 
 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
The finding of the Rent Tribunal as to the rate of monthly rent in June, 
2018 has been upheld by the Appellate Court below. It has further been 
held by the Appellate Court below that ignoring receipts for payment of 
rent in June, 2018 @ Rs.18,000/- per month is erroneous. Said findings 
of the Appellate Court below are reproduced hereunder:  
“12. 
…Even the receipts for the month of January, 
February & March, which are undisputed one, shows the 
payment of rent amount at the rate of Rs.18,000/- per 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 19794/2023                                                                                          7 
 
 
month. It is settled principle of law, that documentary 
evidence prevails over the oral statement, which principle 
is squarely applicable to the facts of the case in hands.  
13. 
The same signature of Muhammad Hanif, 
predecessor in interest are available on receipts Exh. 
R3/117 dated 29.04.2018, Exh R3/118 dated 21.05.2018, 
which have been believed and relied upon by the 
learned Rent Tribunal, however, same signature of 
Muhammad Hanif on Ex. R3/119 dated 30.06.2018, 
Exh R3/120 dated 21.07.2018, Exh R3/121 dated 
20.09.2018 have been disbelieved by the learned Rent 
Tribunal, this contradictory approach by the learned 
Rent Tribunal is not approved by the law. Hence, the 
findings of default in payment of the rent by the 
Appellant is based on misreading of evidence, therefore, 
the same are interfered with.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
The above quoted findings of the Appellate Court below are well 
reasoned and do not merit any interference. 
10. Adverting to the nub of the matter that relates to the return of the 
pagri amount, issue No.4 was formulated by the Rent Tribunal in 
following manner:  
“iv. Whether the rented shop has been obtained 
after payment of Rs.26,25,000/- if yes, what is its 
effect? OPR” 
Before rendering the opinion whether the respondent was able to prove 
that he paid any pagri in accordance with law and has been rightly held 
entitled to its return by the Rent Tribunal as also by the Appellate Court 
below, it will be appropriate to examine the concept of the pagri under 
the law.  
11. Under the erstwhile Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Ordinance, 
1959, payment/receipt of pagri was not permissible, however, initially, 
the Punjab Rented Premises Ordinance, 2007 (“the Ordinance”) and 
there-after, the Act gave recognition to the payment/receipt of the pagri. 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 19794/2023                                                                                          8 
 
 
The Ordinance was endorsed by the provincial legislature, without any 
change, and the Act was promulgated. Section 2(e) of the Act defines 
the term pagri, in the following manner:  
 “(e) “pagri” includes any amount received by a 
landlord at the time of grant or renewal of a tenancy 
except advance rent or security”  
(Emphasis supplied) 
Whereas the term landlord has been defined as under:  
 “(d) “landlord” means the owner of a premises and  
includes a person for the time being entitled or 
authorized to receive rent in respect of the premises”  
Another significant provision of the Act in relation to interpretation and 
adjudication of the term pagri is the tenancy agreement and its contents. 
Section 6 of the Act contemplates that a tenancy agreement, under the 
Act, must reflect amount of pagri, if any. Section 6 reads as under:  
“6.   Contents of tenancy agreement.– (1) A tenancy 
agreement shall contain, as far as possible, the following: 
(a) 
…; 
(b) 
…; 
(c) 
…; 
(d) 
…; 
(e) 
…; 
(f) 
…; and 
(g) 
amount of advance rent, security or pagri, if 
 
any.” 
12. In the present case, the Rent Tribunal relied upon the tenancy 
agreement brought on record by the respondent with assertion that same 
was executed between Muhammad Babar Bilal and the respondent, and 
observed that the same was based on the pagri agreement, between the  
 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 19794/2023                                                                                          9 
 
 
respondent and the ex-tenant that was endorsed by Muhammad Babar 
Bilal. Operative part of the order of the Rent Tribunal is reproduced 
below:  
“19. 
For what has been discussed above, this issue is 
decided in favour of respondent in such a manner that:- 
he entered in the demised premises as a tenant on the 
basis of tenancy agreement No.6142, dated 27.08.2008 
which was executed on the basis of an agreement 
No.21040, dated 09.06.2008. Accordingly, he paid an 
amount of Rs.26,25,000/- to previous tenant of demised 
premises as the amount of Pagri. Said amount was paid 
to predecessor in interest of petitioners namely 
Muhammad Babar Bilal. Petitioners have admittedly 
stepped into his shoes. As such, they are liable to all the 
obligations which incurred on their predecessor in 
interest. Hence, respondent is entitled to recover the same 
from the petitioner. This issue accordingly stands decided 
in favour of respondent.” 
 
 
 
 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
It is the case of the respondent that he paid an amount of Rs.2,625,000/- 
as pagri to the ex-tenant and not the landlord under the pagri agreement 
(Exh-R/10) and the purported landlord (Muhammad Babar Bilal) only 
took commission as per the stance of the respondent. This fact alone 
raises a doubt as to the amount to be refunded by the petitioners, as the 
landlord.  Even otherwise, the conjunctive reading of the above quoted 
various provisions of the Act depicts that the pagri amount, if any, paid 
by a tenant is to be recorded in the tenancy agreement and includes 
payment to the landlord. In the instant case, the amount paid or property 
transferred was made in terms of the pagri agreement and is not recorded 
in the tenancy agreement and hence, cannot be treated as pagri under 
Section 2(e), read with Section 6 of the Act. At this juncture, it will be 
advantageous to reproduce the pagri agreement that reads as under:

Moreover, perusal of record reveals that the pagri agreement has been 
witnessed by one Sheikh Muhammad Asif son of Sheikh Muhammad 
Lateef and Shahzad Mohy-ud-Din son of Muhammad Ashraf Sheikh. 
The said witnesses of the pagri agreement appeared as RWs before the 
Rent Tribunal and purported signatures of Muhammad Babar Bilal are 
also available on the side/margins of the pagri agreement, albeit without 
a thumb impression. The fora below have only relied upon the purported 
signatures of deceased Muhammad Babar Bilal on both the agreements 
(the pagri and the tenancy agreements) to conclude that the agreements 
were genuine ignoring the fact that while the tenancy agreement is 
signed by all the parties as also the witnesses thereof and the thumb 
impressions thereon have also been put by each one of them; the pagri  

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 19794/2023                                                                                          11 
 
 
agreement, which is prior in time, is only signed by the witnesses and 
deceased Muhammad Babar Bilal and no thumb impression of any one 
of them is available, except the ex-tenant. Moreover, on the backside of 
the pagri agreement, receipt of amount of Rs.50,000/- on 06.08.2008 as 
also Rs.100,000/- is acknowledged by the purported ex-tenant, however, 
said payment(s) have not been witnessed by the above referred RWs or 
by the deceased Muhammad Babar Bilal or Muhammad Dilawar but 
name of one Abdul Sattar is reflected as witness, who never appeared 
before the Rent Tribunal. Moreover, at the back of the pagri agreement, 
there is also mentioning of the fact that some property had been 
transferred by the respondent to the ex-tenant of the rented premises to 
establish that the same alongwith the cash payment(s) constituted the 
entire amount of the pagri paid by the respondent. Since there is no 
witness in respect of the factum of payment(s) recorded at the back of 
the pagri agreement, therefore, the same has no evidentiary value. 
Moreover, nothing has been brought on record to show that any 
immovable property was transferred by the respondent to the purported 
ex-tenant of the rented premises pursuant to the pagri agreement and/or 
the tenancy agreement. Furthermore, it has been also asserted by the 
respondent that deceased Muhammad Dilawar was also present at the 
time of execution of the pagri agreement, however, there is no 
justification available on record for not asking the deceased Muhammad 
Dilawar to witness the pagri agreement when statedly the rented 
premises was jointly owned by three brothers and only the son and close 
relative, namely, Sheikh Muhammad Asif, of the ex-tenant, attested the 
said agreement. These facts cast serious doubt in respect of veracity of 
both the agreements. Moreover, the fact that Muhammad Babar Bilal 
died on 05.09.2008 and receipts of rent dated 05.09.2008, 05.10.2008 
and 05.11.2008 purportedly signed by Muhammad Babar Bilal in itself 
defeats the stance of the respondent that the tenancy was created by

Muhammad Babar Bilal, more particularly, when the statement of the

Death Certificate of Muhammad Babar Bilal available on record depicts 
date of death as 05.09.2008. therefore, the above quoted statement of 
RW-1 (the respondent) contradicts the stance taken by learned counsel 
for the respondent during the arguments that deceased Muhammad 
Babar Bilal signed all three above referred receipts at the time of 
execution of the tenancy agreement as acknowledgement of advance 
rent and hence, the case of the respondent falls under clutches of legal 
maxim ‘Allegans Contraria Non Est Audiendus’ (A person who alleges 
things contradictory to each other is not to be heard). 
13. On the top of it is the fact that there is an apparent lack of 
connectivity between the pagri agreement and the tenancy agreement 
(that is later in time) to substantiate that the respondent paid the pagri 
amount with the consent of the landlord and, pursuant thereto, the 
tenancy agreement, which the respondent himself has relied upon, was 
executed inasmuch as there is nothing in the tenancy agreement to 
indicate the said fact. The tenancy agreement reads as under:

Absence of any reference in the tenancy agreement about the pagri 
agreement earlier executed in favour of the respondent or the receipt of 
pagri amount, read with above quoted statement of the respondent 
indicates that both the agreements are not so intertwined and interrelated 
to form part of one and the same transaction and to be read 
conjunctively. This fact alone is sufficient to create an adverse inference 
in relation to the genuineness of the pagri agreement as also the tenancy 
agreement particularly when no reason was put forth by the respondent 
for the said disconnect during the recording of evidence by the Rent 
Tribunal or by his learned counsel during the course of arguments 
before this Court. Consequently, this Court is propelled to conclude that 
the respondent failed to establish that he was inducted as a tenant on the

basis of the tenancy agreement executed on the strength of the pagri 
agreement.  
14. In view of the above discussion, findings of the Courts below, to 
the extent of return of pagri are erroneous, as also result of misreading 
and non-reading of evidence, and hence are not sustainable and the 
respondent is not entitled to receive any amount on account of pagri. To 
this extent, the judgment of the learned Appellate Court below is 
modified and the respondent is obligated to forthwith vacate the rented 
premises along with payment of monthly rent due till date.  
15. Disposed of in the above terms.
