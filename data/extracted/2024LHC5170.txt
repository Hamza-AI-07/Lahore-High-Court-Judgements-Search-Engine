Sarfraz Khan 
Versus 
Province of Punjab & others 
 
J U D G M E N T 
 
Date of hearing:     05.11.2024. 
Petitioner by: 
Mr. Asim Mahmood Malik, Advocate. 
Respondents by: 
Mr. Muhammad Saad Bin Ghazi, Assistant 
Advocate General along with Aman Ullah 
Joiya, Tehsildar Jhang.  
 
Respondent No.3 ex parte.  
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.- Through 
instant revision petition, petitioner has assailed vires of judgments & 
decrees dated 06.04.2015 & 31.10.2017, passed by learned Civil Judge 
and Additional District Judge, Jhang, respectively, whereby 
petitioner’s suit for declaration was concurrently dismissed.  
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that petitioner filed suit for 
declaration, which was contested by respondents through written 
statement. Learned Trial Court, after framing issues, recording 
evidence and hearing arguments of both sides, proceeded to dismiss the 
suit vide judgment & decree dated 06.04.2015. Feeling discontent, 
petitioner preferred appeal before learned Appellate Court, which was 
dismissed vide judgment & decree dated 31.10.2017. Hence, instant 
revision petition. 
3. 
Learned counsel for petitioner submits that after execution of the 
sale deed and sanction of mutation, suit property has devolved upon 
petitioner after getting property rights by District Collector, Jhang vide 
order dated 23.09.2006 and after payment vide mutation No.1403 
dated 30.11.2006. He adds that suit property had become private land, 

2 
C.R. No.155763 of 2018 
therefore, Board of Revenue could not pass the order for cancellation 
of allotment. He argues that important aspects of the matter have not 
been considered by learned Courts below while passing impugned 
judgments & decrees, thus, same are unsustainable in the eye of law. In 
support, he has referred to Province of the Punjab, through District 
Officer, Toba Tek Singh and others v. Nazir Ahmed and 9 others (2008 
SCMR 749), Province of Punjab through Collector and 4 others v. 
Haji Wali Muhammad and 4 others (2004 MLD 441), Rulya v. 
Province of Punjab through District Collector, Sargodha and others 
(2006 YLR 1915), Abdul Ghafoor and others v. Mst. Rasoolan Bibi 
and others (2009 YLR 1593) and Province of the Punjab through 
Collector and 2 others v. Mst. Nabeela Taj and others (2015 YLR 
1635).  
4. 
Conversely, learned Law Officer defends the impugned 
judgments & decrees by contending that petitioner in violation of 
clause 12 of the notification dated 19.03.1995 regarding temporary 
cultivation lease scheme transferred / alienated land to several persons 
on 21.06.2008 before 05-years after the date of execution of deed in 
favour of petitioner, thus, the Board of Revenue under Section 30(2) & 
Section 24 of the Colonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act, 
1912 (“the Act of 1912”) read with clause 15 of the notification dated 
19.03.1995, has lawfully resumed the land in question. He adds that in 
matters relating to allotment of land, refusal and cancellation in 
accordance with law are exclusive domain of the revenue authorities. 
In support, he has relied upon Muhammad Ishaq v. Abdul Ghani and 3 
others (2000 SCMR 1083), Abdul Ghafar and others v. Government of 
West Pakistan and others (PLD 1963 (W.P.) Karachi 215) and 
Province of Punjab through Collector and 2 others v. Muhammad 
Farooq and 2 others (2017 YLR Note 362).  
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused.  
6. 
Petitioner filed suit for declaration with the contention that order 
dated 30.11.2010, passed by Member (Judicial-VI), Board of Revenue, 

3 
C.R. No.155763 of 2018 
Punjab, Lahore / respondent No.2, being against the law and facts, 
without jurisdiction and based on mala fide, is inoperative qua the 
rights of petitioner as in the light of Collector’s order dated 
23.09.2006, petitioner is owner of the suit property detailed in the 
plaint; and that respondents be restrained from cancelling the deed in 
question executed in favour of petitioner and removing his name from 
the column of ownership in revenue record.  
7. 
It is the stance of petitioner that petitioner Sarfraz Khan and 
respondent No.3 Noor Muhammad were jointly allotted land i.e. lot 
No.3 measuring 56-Kanal 11-Marla, situated in square No.30 khata 
No.148/705, Chak Sheikhana, Tehsil & District Jhang in the year 1989 
as a part of cultivation scheme. Petitioner made his part of the land 
cultivable and continued to pay lagan and ultimately moved 
application to the DDOR, Jhang for partition of his land and receipt of 
remaining lagan, which was allowed and petitioner’s share of land 
measuring 28-Kanal 06-Marla was partitioned in square No.30. 
Petitioner moved first application for grant of proprietary rights on 
31.12.1995 (Exh.P1), he again moved application for grant of 
proprietary rights on 01.09.2006 (Exh.P2), which was allowed vide 
order dated 23.09.2006, passed by District Officer (Revenue), Jhang 
and petitioner was held entitled for grant of proprietary rights of the 
suit property in accordance with notification-1995 and finally, 
mutation No.1403 was attested in favour of petitioner on 30.11.2006, 
which was produced in evidence as Exh.P16. 
8. 
It is pertinent to note here that the other allottee, respondent 
No.3, neither made the land allotted to him cultivable nor paid any 
lagan in this regard. He only raised the issue of payment of lagan after 
attestation of mutation in petitioner’s favour and filed an application 
dated 23.07.2023 (Exh.P24) rather he filed appeal challenging 
aforesaid mutation in the Court of EDOR, Jhang, which was rejected 
vide order dated 17.06.2008 (Exh.P23). Subsequently, respondent No.3 
filed revision petition resulting in the cancellation of sale deed in 

4 
C.R. No.155763 of 2018 
favour of petitioner vide order dated 30.11.2010 (Exh.P4), passed by 
Member (Judicial-VI), Board of Revenue, Punjab, Lahore / respondent 
No.2. 
9. 
Once sale price has been deposited and possession was handed 
over to the allottees, by the Collector, no other Revenue Authorities 
even superior to the Collector can intervene to reverse the Collector’s 
decision. If an allotment has been cancelled by Revenue Appellate 
Court, the Civil Court has the jurisdiction to set aside the cancellation, 
especially if it is found to be in violation of the terms of sale or the 
provisions of the Act V of 1912. The Board of Revenue is not 
equipped with any authority even to cancel allotment in favour of 
petitioner once the price has been received and the sale deed has been 
executed. Furthermore, where a transferee has conveyed the land to a 
bona fide purchaser, the power to resume the land, for which 
proprietary rights have already been granted, cannot be exercised. 
After confirmation of the proprietary rights and registration of 
conveyance deed, the allottee would become absolute owner of the 
land. Reliance is placed upon Province of Punjab v. Abdul Latif and 2 
others (PLD 1990 Lahore 66), Muhammad Liaquat and 5 others v. 
Member Board of Revenue (Colonies), Punjab, Lahore and 3 others 
(2000 CLC 953) and Province of Punjab and others v. Waseem 
Arshad and others (PLD 2023 Lahore 564). 
10. 
The Board of Revenue does not have authority to unilaterally 
cancel an allotment after proprietary rights have vested through a 
registered sale deed, unless there is substantial documented evidence of 
fraud or a significant violation of allotment conditions. In such cases, 
the Board must have followed strict procedural steps, including issuing 
a show cause notice and providing an opportunity for response. If the 
Board of Revenue is seeking cancellation, it is recommended to (i) 
review the specific conditions of the original allotment and determine 
if substantial violation exists; ensure full compliance with procedural 
requirements, including issuing detailed notices to involved parties; 

5 
C.R. No.155763 of 2018 
and (ii) if proprietary rights are indeed fully vested, consider legal 
limitations on the Board’s authority and potential challenges based on 
judicial precedents that protect post-transfer proprietary rights. 
11. 
The Hon’ble Superior Courts have consistently upheld principles 
that protect proprietary rights under the Act of 1912. In these cases, it 
has been emphasized that once proprietary rights are granted, same 
cannot be arbitrarily canceled by the authorities. Section 30 of the Act 
ibid mandates the issuance of a formal show cause notice and provides 
the affected party with an opportunity to contest any claims of fraud or 
misrepresentation before the government can resume such land. The 
Courts have further established that once proprietary rights are 
conferred and a conveyance deed is registered, the allottee becomes the 
absolute owner, thereby limiting the Revenue Department’s authority 
to interfere without due legal process. Judicial intervention reflects a 
strong stance against administrative actions that disregard procedural 
fairness and statutory requirements. Reliance is placed upon Anjuman-
e-Ahmadiya, Sargodha v. The Deputy Commissioner, Sargodha & 
another (PLD 1966 Supreme Court 639), Karim Khan and 130 others 
v. The Additional Settlement Commissioner (Land) and 3 others (1993 
SCMR 2344), Yar Muhammad and others v. Mst. Sameena Tayab and 
others (2022 SCMR 1592) and Province of Punjab and others v. 
Waseem Arshad and others (PLD 2023 Lahore 564).  
12. 
There is no cavil with the proposition that post-sale deed 
cancellation requires compelling grounds, such as substantial evidence 
of a legal violation during the initial allotment or transfer process. It is 
reiterated that proprietary rights, once vested, gain additional 
protections under the law and can only be disturbed in instances of 
proven statutory breaches. It is reinforced that procedural fairness is 
crucial, particularly in cases where proprietary rights are contested 
post-sale deed. Even in cases involving fraud, the Board of Revenue 
must provide the affected party with an opportunity to present its case, 
thereby upholding the principle of natural justice. Reliance is placed 

6 
C.R. No.155763 of 2018 
upon Commissioner Multan Division, Multan and others v. 
Muhammad Hussain and others (2015 SCMR 58), Kamal through 
Legal Heirs v. Member, Board of Revenue and others (1997 CLC 
1735), Province of Punjab v. Javed Iqbal and others (2007 YLR 1008) 
and Nisar Ahmad v. Member Board of Revenue (Colonies), Punjab, 
Lahore and another (2019 CLC 46).  
13. 
The case law relied upon by learned Law Officer, being 
distinguishable, is not attracted to the present scenario.  
14. 
Resultantly, instant revision petition is allowed, impugned 
judgments & decrees dated 06.04.2015 & 31.10.2017, passed by 
learned Civil Judge and Additional District Judge, Jhang, respectively, 
are set aside.
