15.05.2024 Mr. Babar Bilal Awan, Advocate for the petitioners. 
Mr. Muhammad Jawad Yaqoob, Additional Advocate 
General with Majeed, SI. 
Mr. 
Fahad 
Ahmad

Advocate 
for 
respondents No.02 & 03. 
  
 
          Through this writ petition, the petitioners have 
assailed the order dated 17.10.2022 passed by learned 
Senior Civil Judge (Family Division), Hafizabad whereby the 
learned Judge has directed DNA analysis of minor Umme 
Mabad alias Maryam in order to settle the claim between 
two parties about the paternity of such minor and that order 
was result of a direction by this Court passed in Writ 
Petition No.16871-H of 2022 on 21.03.2022. 
 
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners contends that 
DNA examination for the purpose of paternity is always 
subject to consent of the parties and the learned Judge 
should have attended to this aspect of the case because 
direction of this Court for DNA examination cannot ipso 
facto override the legal position. In order to fortify his 
arguments, learned counsel for the petitioners has referred 
case reported as “MUHAMMAD NAWAZ versus ADDITIONAL 
DISTRICT AND SESSIONS JUDGE  and others”  (PLD 2023 
Supreme Court 461). 
 
3. 
 On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents 
No.02 & 03 initially argued that the judgment relied upon by 

       Writ Petition No.75322 of 2022 
 
 
                                     2 
 
 
learned counsel for the petitioners is on different legal 
premise whereas in the present situation, when two parties 
are claiming paternity over a minor, the DNA would be a 
best course to ascertain such fact. However, later conceded 
that evidence of the parties before the lower Court is 
almost complete, therefore, an appropriate direction in this 
regard be passed to the learned trial Court. 
 
4. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
 
5. 
Determination of paternity of a minor has been dilated 
upon in different cases by this Court and the Supreme Court 
of Pakistan as well. The pro and contra judgments are 
necessary to be made part of this order for guidelines to the 
trial Court to pass an appropriate order. Case reported as 
“ABDUL LATIF Versus ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE, KASUR 
and 4 others” (2016 CLC 1553), focused upon the necessity of 
DNA test as under; 
“………it is not a case of legitimacy of the petitioner but it is 
claimed that he was born out of the wedlock of some other 
known spouses and he was adopted son of the parents of 
respondents Nos. 3 and 4, who at that time were issueless. 
Here the objects are known and in case of any ambiguity or 
doubt in the veracity of the report, the parties will be at 
liberty to file objections and the same will be resolved 
keeping in view the direct evidence likely to be produced by 
the parties.” 
 
6.     The judgments which prohibit conducting DNA without 
the consent of parties are referred below with reasoning. 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan in a recent case reported as 
“MUHAMMAD NAWAZ versus ADDITIONAL DISTRICT AND 
SESSIONS JUDGE and others” (PLD 2023 Supreme Court 
461) observed as under: 
“We find that both the revisional court and the High Court have 
failed to consider that the conducting of the DNA test of a 
person, without his consent, infringes his fundamental rights to 
liberty and privacy guaranteed by Articles 9 and 14 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan” 
 
A court order for the DNA test of two persons as a means of 
identifying their genetic relationships interferes with their right 

       Writ Petition No.75322 of 2022 
 
 
                                     3 
 
 
to privacy and liberty. This test can be ordered only either with 
the consent of the persons concerned or without their consent 
if permissible under a law. We are aware of certain provisions 
of criminal law which permit the DNA test of an accused 
person without his consent, but no civil law has been brought 
to our notice which allows this test in civil cases without the 
consent of the person concerned. 
 
It may be pertinent to mention here that in a civil case, if the 
person upon whom the onus to prove his genetic relationship 
with another person lies, does not give consent for his DNA 
test, and thus withholds such evidence, the court may draw an 
adverse presumption against the claim of such person and 
presume 
that 
such 
evidence, 
if 
produced, 
would 
be 
unfavourable to him, as per Article 129(g) of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat 1984.  
 
In another case reported as “Mst. LAILA QAYYUM Versus 
FAWAD QAYYUM and others”  (PLD 2019 Supreme Court 
449), The Supreme Court of Pakistan says as under: 
 
“Learned Mr. Awan is also right in referring to the case of 
Salman Akram Raja wherein it was held that a free lady 
cannot be compelled to give a sample for DNA testing as it 
would violate her liberty. If a sample is forcibly taken from 
Laila to determine her paternity it would violate her liberty, 
dignity and privacy which Article 14 of the Constitution of the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan ("the Constitution") guarantees 
to a free person” 
 
In case reported as “SALMAN AKRAM RAJA and another 
Versus GOVERNMENT OF PUNJAB through Chief Secretary, 
and others” (2013 SCMR 203), the observations of Supreme 
Court of Pakistan were to the following effect;  
 
“It is well settled that the consent of victim is necessary and 
she/he cannot be subjected to DNA or other medical test 
forcibly for prosecution purposes because that would amount 
to infringement of personal liberty of such persons” 
 
We are in agreement with the learned counsel to the extent 
that DNA samples etc. should be preserved for make use of it 
at the appropriate stage whenever is required. However, the 
legislature is free to regularize the procedure by making 
appropriate legislation in this behalf” 
 
Same was the view of this Court in case reported as “Mst. 
SAFIA BIBI and another Versus MUHAMMAD AKBAR and 
others” (PLD 2018 Lahore 758) that: 
 

       Writ Petition No.75322 of 2022 
 
 
                                     4 
 
 
“If a person does not give consent for such test, he/she cannot 
be compelled for the test. It amounts to interference with 
personal liberty of a person. It was finally concluded that the 
Court has power to order for DNA Test or any blood test in 
order to ascertain the truthfulness of allegations but such 
order must be passed with the consent of a party, the order 
cannot be made in routine. Compelling a person to undergo a 
DNA Test can have serious consequences. It is the duty of a 
court to safeguard and protect personal liberty of every citizen” 
 
In case reported as “Mst. RUBINA KAUSAR Versus 
ADDITIONAL SESSIONS JUDGE and others”  (PLD 2017 
Lahore 604) this Court has held that: 
“The Indian Supreme Court in the case of Goutam Kundu v. The 
State of W.B. (AIR 1993 SC 2295) held that before the blood test 
of a person is ordered, his consent is required, as, that test is 
concerned with his personal liberty and cannot be carried out 
without his consent. The Court went to an extent to order that 
even if there is legislation which can compel the blood test, 
then also, unless and until there is consent of the concerned 
person, he cannot be compelled to go to the hospital for giving 
blood test.” 
 
In the United States, paternity testing is fully legal, and fathers 
may test their children without the consent or knowledge of the 
mother. Paternity testing take-home kits are readily available 
for purchase, though their results are not admissible in court, 
and are for personal knowledge only. Only a court-ordered 
paternity test may be used as evidence in court proceedings. 
Thus, for what has been discussed above, it is not safe to 
resort to DNA testing in Civil matters of inheritance as a matter 
of routine, the paternity issue could be proved by oral and 
documentary evidence already recorded by the trial Court.” 
 
Case reported as “NASEER AHMED Versus Mst. AZRAH and 
another” (PLD 2010 Karachi 61) says that: 
“As far as, application for DNA test is concerned, since the 
question whether the applicant before the trial Court is father 
of the child or not has to be decided on the basis of evidence 
available, it is obviously for the Family Court to decide whether 
it needs DNA tests or not. Obviously costs of such DNA test 
should be borne by the person who made the application for 
such test” 
 
7.  An Article on “Islamic Law of Paternity and DNA 
Evidence” by Ayman Shabana, posted on June 28, 2021 
throws light on the issue that for paternity verification, two 
main approaches can be identified for the incorporation of 
DNA evidence: ‘comprehensive and limited’. While the 

       Writ Petition No.75322 of 2022 
 
 
                                     5 
 
 
former seeks to recognize DNA evidence as a new and 
almost an independent method, which can ensure the 
achievement of the sharīʿa objectives in the domain of 
paternity and lineage, the latter insists that DNA evidence 
should be treated as a type of circumstantial evidence, 
which can be compared to the classical method of qiyāfah. 
While the first approach has been pursued by some jurists, 
the 
second 
approach 
has 
been 
adopted 
by 
the 
overwhelming majority of contemporary Muslim scholars, 
as 
reflected 
in 
both 
individual 
as 
well 
as 
institutional fatwās, 
statements, 
resolutions, 
and 
recommendations. The information in this respect is as 
follows; 
 
This is best illustrated by the resolution of the Islamic Fiqh 
Council of the Muslim World League, which was issued in its 
16th session, held in Mecca in January 2002. The resolution 
acknowledges DNA testing as an effective scientific method, 
which can yield certain or near certain results. However, 
while the resolution indicates that it should be considered 
more effective than the traditional method of physiognomy, 
it specifies certain stipulations that should govern its 
implementation. For example, according to the resolution, 
DNA testing for paternity verification should be used to 
support sharīʿa-based methods but not to verify already 
existing and established paternity relationships. Moreover, 
it should be used mainly in contested and disputed cases. [1]1 
 
Some of the jurists are of the view that DNA testing can 
provide almost certain results while other see its results as 
probabilistic, therefore such testing is always subject to 
statutory regulations. Even otherwise DNA results are only 
corroborative evidence which are to be accepted or rejected 
in the light of evidence of the parties and in case of dispute 
the expert can also be summoned to justify his opinion.  
 
8. 
After attending the above cases, it is clarified that 
consent of the parties is essential to decide claim of the

parties with respect to paternity of the child. If the parties 
do not give consent for such DNA examination, then learned 
trial Court can draw adverse inference as per Article 129 (g) 
of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 and shall proceed to 
decide the question of paternity on the basis of evidence 
produced by the parties. In this respect, Court can also take 
help from Quranic verses and Hadith of Holy Prophet. One 
of the examples is quoted in a judgment of Federal Shariat 
Court titled “Mst. RAJO MAI versus THE STATE” (1992 P Cr.LJ 
1011) wherein it was held that for tracing the origin of the 
child the male member of the affair could be traced out by 
evidence particularly by ascertaining the origin and blood 
grouping of the child, origin of child could also be 
ascertained by comparing features and limbs of child with 
alleged claimant. 
 
9.      The above referred article on “Islamic Law of Paternity 
and DNA Evidence” by Ayman Shabana also throws light on 
such method. According to the tradition, it is a form of 
circumstantial evidence which is called physiognomy 
(qiyāfah), and was quite popular in the pre-Islamic Arabian 
culture. The word is derived from the Arabic root (qāfa), 
which stands for the act of following or tracing. It conveys 
the ability to follow marks on the ground, mainly in the 
desert. It also denotes the ability to examine resemblance in 
bodily and physical features for the purpose of confirming 
family relationships, especially in paternity disputes. Most 
jurists, justify the possibility of resort to physiognomy in 
contested cases by arguing that verification of lineage 
relationships 
is 
an 
important 
personal 
and 
social 
need. Sharīʿa seeks 
to 
provide 
means 
to 
enable 
establishment of paternity whenever possible even on the 
basis of probable evidence.

10. 
   The net result of above discussion is that writ 
petition is allowed and consequently order dated 17.10.2022, 
impugned herein is set aside. Learned trial court can resort 
to DNA testing only with the consent of the parties or 
otherwise competent to decide the matter on the basis of 
evidence produced by the parties including resort to 
physiognomy (qiyāfah) as highlighted above.
