Ghulam Akhtar   
vs.  
 
Muhammad Iqbal 
 
 
J U D G M E N T 
Date of Hearing: 
30.05.2024 
Petitioner by: 
Rana Muhammad Nazir Khan Saeed, 
Advocate.  
Respondent by: 
Mr. Muhammad Salman Amir, Advocate.  
        
 
Anwaar Hussain, J.  The respondent, Muhammad Iqbal, 
instituted a suit for specific performance of contract, against the 
petitioner, on the basis of a written agreement to sell dated 
01.06.2013 (“agreement”) with the averments that total sale 
consideration for the suit property was settled as Rs.2,400,000/-, out 
of which, an amount of Rs.100,000/- was received by the petitioner 
as earnest money, in the presence of witnesses and the remaining 
was to be paid within one year and possession of the suit property 
was handed over to the respondent, however,  when the respondent 
requested for execution of the sale deed, the petitioner declined 
which constrained the respondent to institute the suit that was 
contested by the petitioner, inter alia, on the ground that the 
agreement is fraudulent and the possession of the suit property was 
not given to the respondent under the agreement. The suit was 
dismissed by the Trial Court, vide judgment and decree dated 
17.12.2018, against which the respondent preferred an appeal that 
was allowed and through impugned judgment and decree dated 

2 
C.R. No.16-D of 2021 
 
 
23.01.2020, the suit of the respondent was decreed. Hence, the 
present civil revision.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner states that the judgments of 
the Courts below are at variance. Adds that well-reasoned judgment 
of the Trial Court has been upended by the Appellate Court below, 
without properly appreciating the evidence available on record. 
Contends that the name of the scribe (PW-2) was not reflected in the 
plaint and hence, the testimony of PW-2 as the scribe was beyond 
pleadings; that the petitioner was pursuing litigation before the 
Revenue Authorities for partition of the suit property forming part of 
joint khata and it belies logic that the petitioner would be selling his 
property to the respondent; and that even if the agreement is 
presumed to be genuine, the respondent  had no resources to pay the 
balance sale consideration as the same was not tendered before the 
Trial Court at the time of filing of the suit, which reflects that the 
respondent was neither willing nor ready to perform his part of the 
agreement.  
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent supports the 
impugned judgment and decree passed by the Appellate Court 
below. As regards non-deposit of balance consideration, learned 
counsel submits that the respondent was not directed by the Trial 
Court to deposit the balance sale consideration and when the suit 
was decreed in appeal, the respondent immediately deposited the 
said amount within 10-days as directed by the said Court and in 
order to substantiate his contentions, has produced the original 
challan that has been seen and returned. He also adds that in the 
execution proceedings, the petitioner has not appeared and Bai 
Nama Sultani¸ in favour of the respondent has also been registered, 
in respect of the suit property.

4. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
5. 
While the Trial Court was persuaded with the fact that no 
record of rights exhibiting ownership of the petitioner/defendant, as 
on the date of the execution of the agreement, was examined and has 
not been referred in the agreement and signatures and/or thumb 
impression of the petitioner were not available on the revenue tickets 
affixed on the agreement, to non-suit the respondent; the Appellate 
Court below has relied upon the admission on part of the petitioner 
qua his signatures on the agreement to upend the findings of the 
Trial Court. Therefore, it is for this Court to examine whether the 
Appellate Court below erred in upending the judgment of the Trial 
Court by exercising jurisdiction in a manner which warrants 
interference of this Court in exercise of revisional jurisdiction and 
whether while passing the impugned judgment, principles of equity 
were kept in sight by the Appellate Court below.  
6. 
I have perused the record with abled assistance of learned 
counsel for the parties. There is no doubt that the agreement brought 
on record as Exh.P-1 is not written on a stamp paper but on a letter 
head. There is also no denial of the fact that it was not scribed by an 
authorized person/stamp vendor and PW-2 was not referred in the 
pleadings as scribe of the agreement, however, civil cases are to be 
decided on the basis of preponderance of evidence and perusal of the 
record reveals that the petitioner while appearing as DW-1 was 
asked a specific questions to which he responded as under: 
 
 َ" دمیع اک درتف اہجں ھٹیب رک وسدا ایک اھت ایمونایل وہلٹ ےک اسھت ےہ۔
۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔ ہی
 درتس ےہ ہکExh-P-1
 رپ ریمے دطختس ںیہ
۔" 
The above quoted portion of the statement of the petitioner 
constitutes an unequivocal admission of the execution of the 
agreement. It is also noted that while the petitioner admitted the 

4 
C.R. No.16-D of 2021 
 
 
execution of the agreement during cross-examination, he denied 
affixing of signatures and/or thumb impression on the agreement in 
his pleadings and has reiterated the same stance before this Court. 
However, there is no explanation as to why no effort was made by 
the petitioner to seek comparison of his admitted thumb impression 
and/or signatures with the disputed signatures and thumb impression 
on the agreement. Furthermore, while being cross-examined, the 
petitioner also stated as under: 
"
-----
 ںیم ےن وج دروخاںیتس دی ںیھت ابتب ہضبق
ریمی وک
یئ یئ ونشا یئ ہن وہ ریمی دروخاتس ڑلا یئ
 ڑگھجا وریغہ یک ابتب یھت ۔ ۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔ںیم ےن ڑلایئ ڑگھجا اک دمحم اابقل وک رایض انہم رحتری رک ےک دای
 اھت اہتبل ںیم ےن ارقارانہم یک ابتب اور ارقار انہم ےک وگااہن ےک الخف اھتہن رپ وکیئ دروخاتس ہن دی
ےہ۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔زاب
ین رایض انہم وہا اھت۔" 
7. 
In view of the above quoted admission of the petitioner, even 
if the version of the petitioner is accepted that the respondent 
forcibly took possession of the suit property, admittedly, there was 
no application of the petitioner for registration of criminal case in 
that regard and only applications on account of quarrels and 
wrangles with the petitioner were filed, which too were dismissed. It 
belies logic that a person will lose his entire land on account of use 
of force and will remain mum and will not initiate legal proceedings 
against the culprits. Moreover, the Appellate Court below has aptly 
encapsulated the entire controversy in the impugned judgment while 
dealing with assertion of the petitioner that he was pursuing the 
litigation on  the revenue side and hence, logically cannot execute an 
agreement to sell. Operative part of the impugned judgment reads as 
under: 
“15. Further, admittedly possession of the suit 
property was with the appellant and although 
respondent attempted to justify the same by alleging 
and stating that appellant took the possession forcibly 
but this stance was not substantiated by the respondent 

5 
C.R. No.16-D of 2021 
 
 
during the evidence and he failed to place on file any 
document to prove that he ever approached to the 
concerned quarters for recovery of possession. 
Admittedly respondent had not filed any suit for 
possession against the appellant till to date. Keeping in 
view the admission on behalf of respondent regarding 
signatures available on agreement to sell Exh.P-1 it is 
proved that long standing, continued and uninterrupted 
possession of the appellant over the suit property is in 
consequence of the agreement to sell Exh.P-1. 
16.  
Learned trial court was swayed with the 
documentary evidence produced by the respondent to 
prove that some litigation was already pending before 
the revenue court between the parties and due to 
which execution of agreement to sell was uncalled 
for. It is available from the record that appellant had 
earlier purchased the share of brothers and sisters of 
the respondent whereupon a petition for partition was 
filed by the respondent. This was not such kind of 
litigation prohibiting the execution of agreement to 
sell. In addition to all above according to the 
document Exh.P-1 the suit property was purchased by 
the 
appellant 
against 
a 
consideration 
of 
Rs.24,00,000/- 
whereas 
a 
meager 
amount 
of 
Rs.1,00,000/- has been shown to be paid as earnest 
money which shows bona fide on part of appellant 
and there was no restraint upon him to mention a 
bigger portion of price of the suit property to be 
mentioned as earnest money if the agreement to sell 
Exh.P-1 was prepared with forgery.” 
 
 
 
 
 
   (Emphasis supplied) 
This Court agrees with the reasoning put forth by the Appellate 
Court below while holding that the agreement stood proved. It is 
settled principle of law that in the event of a conflict between the 
judgments of the Courts below, preference should be given to the 
views of the Appellate Court below, who had the opportunity of re-
examining and analyzing the evidence on the record. Cases reported 

6 
C.R. No.16-D of 2021 
 
 
as “Enayat Sons (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Government of Pakistan through 
Secretary, Finance and others” (2007 SCMR 969) and 
“Muhammad Hafeez and another v. District Judge, Karachi East 
and another” (2008 SCMR 398) are referred in this regard.  
8. 
However, this Court cannot lose sight of the fact that in terms 
of Section 22 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 (“the Act”), the 
jurisdiction of the Courts to issue a decree of specific performance is 
discretionary/equitable in nature, thus, the Court is not bound to 
grant such relief merely because it is lawful to do so. In cases 
involving specific performance, the primary part of the contract is 
the consideration to be paid by the vendee for which he must exhibit 
his willingness and readiness, at all times. In this regard, the vendee 
must unconditionally seek permission of the Court, on the first date 
of hearing, to deposit the remaining sale consideration. The Supreme 
Court in case reported as “Hamood Mehmood v. Mst. Shabana 
Ishaque and others” (2017 SCMR 2022) observed that it is 
mandatory for a person seeking performance of the contract, under 
the Act, to seek permission of the Court to deposit the balance sale 
consideration. The respondent/plaintiff had admittedly not made any 
such request in terms of settled principle of equity i.e., “he who 
seeks equity must do equity”, without waiting for any direction 
from the Trial Court and/or the Appellate Court till such time the 
suit was decreed by the latter Court.  
9. 
No doubt that the Trial Court did not direct the respondent to 
deposit the balance sale consideration until the Appellate Court 
below decreed the suit, however, the same enabled the respondent to 
enjoy the possession of the suit property, for good 07 years 
approximately, while he only paid Rs. 100,000/- to the petitioner, 
which constitute approximately 4%, only, of the total sale 
consideration (Rs. 2,400,000). Generally, a substantial amount, at 

7 
C.R. No.16-D of 2021 
 
 
least 20 or 25% of the sale consideration amount, is paid as earnest 
money and even more in cases when the agreement to sell is 
executed coupled with handing over of the possession, to the 
vendees. In the present case, a meagre amount of Rs.100,000/- was 
paid as earnest money and the possession of the suit property was 
also taken over by the respondent whereafter the respondent 
continued to retain both the possession of suit property as well as the 
96% of outstanding sale consideration, which in the opinion of this 
Court is inequitable, on the part of the respondent. Inequity 
perpetuated when neither the Trial Court nor the Appellate Court 
below directed deposit of the balance consideration, at the time of 
entertaining the suit or admitting the appeal  preferred by the 
respondent, in addition to the fact that the respondent never showed 
his willingness to deposit the balance sale consideration. This aspect 
of the matter has not been considered by the Appellate Court below, 
which needs to be corrected by this Court while exercising 
revisional jurisdiction.  
10. 
There is no denial that with the passage of time, there has 
been inflation in the country and Pakistani Rupee has considerably 
devalued. While the petitioner claims that price of similar property 
in the vicinity has escalated thrice, learned counsel for the 
respondent could not refute that the price has been doubled during 
the pendency of the proceedings. Therefore, it is equitable to 
improve the total sale price. In this regard, I am fortified by the dicta 
laid down in case reported as “Muhammad Siddique vs. Muhammad 
Akram” (2000 SCMR 533). While the findings of the Appellate 
Court below are upheld, the respondent is directed to deposit 
additional Rupees Two Million, within a period of two months, from 
today with the Treasury Office where the respondent had already 
deposited the balance sale consideration (i.e., Rs. 2,300,000), in 

8 
C.R. No.16-D of 2021 
 
 
compliance with the impugned judgement dated 23.01.2020. In case 
of failure on part of the respondent to deposit the said amount, this 
judgment shall cease to have an effect and the petition shall deemed 
to have been accepted as prayed for.   
11. 
Disposed of in above terms. No order as to costs.
