Significant time has been spent on hearing oral 
arguments of the learned counsel for the parties. It is 
evident that the parties are in tension with each other on 
issues of recent origin. The arguments in this Court and 
the list of documents relied upon (which are common in 
some respects though varying in construction) have 
underscored the reasons for falling out amongst brothers 
regarding a business which is a family business operated 
through an arrangement stitched together by a loose set 
of rules. It is unfortunate to note that the brothers have 
now chosen to thrust allegations at each other and 
ultimately to bring their disagreements into the public 
domain. The reasons for this are not hard to divine. The 
wide margin of judgment afforded to each party has 
eroded over time. At the heart is the enormous sums of 
money involved and the gradual lack of trust which set 
in.

2. 
Inevitably, the resolution of the dispute would 
involve a complex set of orders to be passed. If taken to 
its logical end, the solution cannot be shallow or facile. In 
a likely scenario, the brothers may have to part ways in a 
commercial sense and take the route of severance of 
business relationship. This may involve a buy-out scheme 
yet the litigation may linger on for a number of years. 
This will have debilitating effect not only on their 
personal relations but, as time passes, the businesses 
would suffer irreparably to the detriment of both the 
parties. 
3. 
The circumstances brought forth in the prefatory 
above led this Court to propose the resolution of disputes 
between parties through mediation. This method of 
alternate 
dispute 
resolution 
now 
finds 
statutory 
expression in Order IX-B of the Code of Civil Procedure, 
1908. This paradigmatic Order was inserted by the Lahore 
High Court’s amendment on 22.08.2018 and was the first 
such attempt, in my opinion, to codify the rules relating 
to mediation in our legal landscape. For, it is a cardinal 
rule of administration of justice that the courts have such 
powers only as are conferred by law. We cannot derive 
powers upon fanciful and improper notions. A Judge is 
constricted by rules. Therefore, if this Court is to compel 

 
C.O No.74580/2023 
 
 
 
 
 
3
the parties to mediate, it must be soundly based and have 
provenance in law.  
4. 
Order IX-B provides that: 
“ Alternate Dispute Resolution  
1.  
Reference to mediation. (1) Except where the Court is 
satisfied that there is no possibility of mediation or an 
intricate question of law or facts is involved, the Court shall 
refer the case for mediation.  
(2)  While referring the matter for mediation, 
the Court may indicate the material issues for 
determination through mediation.  
2.  
Appearance of parties. Where a case is referred for 
mediation, the Court shall stay the proceedings for a period 
not exceeding thirty days and direct the parties to appear 
before the Mediation Centre, set up by Lahore High Court, 
on such date and time as the Court may specify.  
3. 
 Settlement. (1) Where the mediation proceedings are 
successful and the parties have arrived at an agreement, the 
Mediator shall cause the same to be recorded in writing, 
signed by the parties or their recognized agents or their 
pleaders and attested by two independent witnesses.  
(2) The agreement shall be certified by the 
Mediator and transmitted forthwith, through the 
Administrator of the Mediation Center, to the Court. 
 (3) The Court shall, on receipt of the 
agreement, pass a decree in terms thereof unless the 
Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing finds that 
the agreement between the parties is not enforceable 
at law.  
(4) Where settlement relates only to a part of 
the dispute, the Court shall pass decree or an order in 
terms of such settlement and proceed to adjudicate the 
remaining issues.  
4. 
 Failure of mediation. Where the mediation fails and 
no settlement is made between the parties, the Mediator shall 
submit a report to the Court and the Court shall proceed with 
the case from the stage it was referred to Mediation.” 
5. 
As the statutory wording makes clear, a court is 
obliged to refer a case for mediation. This is a mandatory 
requirement enjoined by law now and equally applies to 
proceedings under the Companies Act, 2017 to the extent 

 
C.O No.74580/2023 
 
 
 
 
 
4
as this Court may determine in its discretion. Reference 
may be made to section 6(15) of the 2017 Act, which 
provides that: 
“(15)  Save as otherwise expressly provided under this 
Act, 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
Qanun-e-Shahadat 
(Order)1984 (P.O. No. X of 1984) and the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908 (Act V of 1908) shall not apply to the 
proceedings under this section except to such extent as 
the Court may determine in its discretion.” 
6. 
Mediation, in the first instance, should be the 
preferred mode of resolution and applies, a fortiori, to 
cases which involve wrangling between close family 
members. This method has many obvious benefits least of 
all to save cost, businesses and personal relations. If taken 
under the scrupulous attention of this Court and by a 
respectable Mediator, the process will likely succeed in its 
purpose.  
7. 
Seeking footing in the statutory text, the dispute is 
being referred to mediation. It must be noted that the 
parties, too, were forthcoming to the suggestion and 
wholeheartedly embraced it.  
8. 
We also have precedents for resort to this method 
of dispute resolution of corporate disputes. Jawad 
Hassan, J. of this Court has taken this route in at least two 
cases reported as Faisal Zafar and another v Siraj-ud-Din & 
4 others (2024 CLD 1) and  Netherlands Financierings

Maatschappij Voor Ontwikkelingslanden N.V. (F.M.O.) 
V/S Morgah Valley Limited and SECP (2022 LHC 9764). In 
CP 2226-L of 2021 etc. Province of Punjab etc. v M/s Haroon 
Construction Co. etc., Supreme Court of Pakistan alluded 
to the process of mediation as an effective mode of 
disposition in the toolkit of courts.   
9. 
Different names came up for consideration as a 
Mediator. The parties did not disagree on the name of 
Justice Mushir Alam, formerly Judge Supreme Court of 
Pakistan who, doubtless, preeminently qualifies for the 
assignment given his impressive resume and the respect 
that he has garnered over the years. Under the 
circumstances, Justice Mushir Alam is appointed as a 
Mediator to attempt to resolve the disputes which have 
arisen between the parties in respect of commercial and 
management issues of ATS Synthetic (Pvt.) Ltd. 
(respondent No.3) (ATS) 
10. 
Broadly the material issues of determination would 
be the allegations relating to certain transactions in 
respect of business activities of ATS during the year 2023 
(the exact dates can be specified in the parties’ briefs to 
the Mediator) so that those transactions work to the 
benefit of ATS and not any particular individual. If the 
parties arrive at an agreement on this aspect, the learned 
Mediator 
shall 
further 
delve 
into 
the 
issue 
of 

 
C.O No.74580/2023

management woes confronting ATS (which seem to be 
loose and elastic at the moment) and to ask the parties to 
agree on the future course of managerial structure 
keeping in line with the 2017 Act. The parties shall 
present their briefs and skeleton arguments to the learned 
Mediator and exchange copies in advance. The contents 
of the petition and its replies may serve as briefs on behalf 
of parties. The procedure of mediation is left to be 
determined by the learned Mediator who is requested to 
proceed expeditiously in the matter given the sensitivity 
of the situation. Before I tear myself away, it is earnestly 
expected that the parties will approach the process of 
mediation with fairness and an eye on the future of ATS 
which, taken together, has given them enormous benefits 
over their working lifetimes.

C.M.No.1/2023 
12. 
The order passed on 13.11.2023 is modified so that 
any cheque from ATS accounts in excess of Rs.1 million 
shall be countersigned by respondent No.1 too. This 
order shall be conveyed to the bankers of ATS.
