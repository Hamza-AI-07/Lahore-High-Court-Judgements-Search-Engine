MUZAMIL AKHTAR SHABIR, J: Through this 
constitution petition, petitioner has prayed as under:  
“In view of the foregoing facts and peculiar circumstances 
of the case, it is, therefore, most respectfully prayed that 
this instant petition may kindly be allowed and as the 
Election Commission of Pakistan has badly failed to 
implement Articles 218 & 220 of the Constitution of 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and at the same time 
the respondent/Chief Secretary of Punjab and Inspector 
General of Police Punjab are also reluctant to holding the 
election within the stipulated time as directed by the 
august Supreme Court of Pakistan read with different 
constitutional provisions, hence, directions may kindly be 
made to all the respondents to conduct fair and free 
transparent elections in view of Article 218 (3) read with 
Article 220 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 read with judgments on the subject, of 
course, in the interest of justice, equity and fair play.”  
2. 
Mr. Muhammad Azhar Siddique, Advocate-learned 
counsel for the petitioner states that the Election 
Commission of Pakistan has failed to implement Articles 
218 and 220 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1972 “the Constitution” and at the same time, the 

                       
W.P.No.18733  of  2023 
-:2:-
respondent-Chief Secretary of Punjab and Inspector General 
of Police, Punjab are reluctant to hold the election within the 
stipulated time as directed by the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan and in the circumstances, a direction may be issued 
to all the respondents to conduct fair and free transparent 
election in terms of Article 218 (3) read with Article 220 of 
the Constitution, for which purpose, the learned counsel for 
petitioner has relied upon the averments of the instant 
constitution petition as well as the documents attached with 
it to substantiate his stance.   
3. 
The petitioner seeks direction to respondent-authority 
for conducting elections in fair manner in terms of Article 
218 and 220 of the Constitution which are reproduced as 
under:  
“218. (1) For the purpose of election to both Houses of 
Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament), Provincial Assemblies and 
for election to such other public offices as may be 
specified by law, a permanent Election Commission shall 
be constituted in accordance with this Article.  
(2) The Election Commission shall consist of—  
(a) the Commissioner who shall be Chairman of the 
Commission; and  
(b) four members, one from each Province, each of 
whom shall be a person who has been a Judge of a 
High Court or has been a senior civil servant or is a 
technocrat and is not more than sixty-five years of age, 
to be appointed by the President in the manner 
provided for appointment of the Commissioner in 
clauses (2A) and (2B) of Article 213.  
Explanation.—“senior civil servant” and “technocrat” 
shall have the same meaning as given in clause (2) of 
Article 213.  
(3) It shall be the duty of the Election Commission to 
organize and conduct the election and to make such 
arrangements as are necessary to ensure that the 
election is conducted honestly, justly, fairly and in

accordance with law, and that corrupt practices are 
guarded against. 
219. ………………… …………. ……………. …………. 
……………. ……………… …………….. 
220. It shall be the duty of all executive authorities in the 
Federation and in the Provinces to assist the 
Commissioner and the Election Commission in the 
discharge of his or their functions.”  
4. 
The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has already 
issued direction for holding the elections to the Election 
Commission of Pakistan in Suo Motu Case No.1 of 2023, 
Const. Petition No.1 of 2023 and Const. Petition No.2 of 
2023 titled “Islamabad High Court Bar Association 
Islamabad through its President etc. v. Election Commission 
of Pakistan through the Chief Election Commissioner, 
Islamabad and others” and has resolved the controversy 
vide order dated 01.03.2023.  For ready reference, the 
operative part of the said order is reproduced as under:- 
“10. On a conjoint reading of the foregoing provisions we 
conclude and hold as follows: 
a. In situations where the Assembly is dissolved by an 
order of the Governor, the constitutional responsibility 
of appointing a date for the general election that must 
follow is to be discharged by the Governor as provided 
in terms of Article 105(3)(a). These are the situations 
described in paras 5 and 6 (a) above. 
b. In situations where the Assembly is not dissolved by 
an 
order 
of 
the 
Governor, 
the 
constitutional 
responsibility of appointing a date for the general 
election that must follow is to be discharged by the 
President as provided in terms of s. 57(1) of the 2017 
Act. These are the situations described in paras 6(b) 
and 7 above. 
11. Since the general election on a dissolution of a 
Provincial Assembly has to be held within a time period 
stipulated by the Constitution itself, which is a 
constitutional imperative, the President or, as the case 

                       
W.P.No.18733  of  2023 
-:4:-
may be, the Governor must discharge the constitutional 
responsibility of appointing a date for the said election 
swiftly and without any delay and within the shortest time 
possible. The Election Commission must proactively be 
available to the President or the Governor, and be 
prepared for such consultation as required for a date for 
the holding of general elections.  
12. It follows from the foregoing that in relation to the 
dissolution of the Punjab Assembly, to which the situation 
described in para 6(b) above applied, the constitutional 
responsibility for appointing a date for the general 
election that must follow was to be discharged by the 
President. However, in relation to the dissolution of the 
KPK Assembly, to which the situation described in para 
6(a) above applied, the constitutional responsibility for 
appointing a date for the general election that must follow 
was to be discharged by the Governor.  
13. It further follows that the order of the President dated 
20.02.2023 is constitutionally competent and subject to 
what is observed below, it is hereby affirmed insofar as it 
applies to the Punjab Assembly; but the same is 
constitutionally invalid insofar as it applies to the KPK 
Assembly and is therefore hereby set aside. It also follows 
that the Governor of KPK Province, inasmuch as he has 
not appointed a date for the holding of the general 
election to the Assembly of that Province is in breach of 
his constitutional responsibility.  
14. It is further declared and directed as follows in 
relation to the matters before the Court:  
a. In ordinary circumstances the general election to the 
Punjab Assembly ought to be held on 09.04.2023, the 
date announced by the President in terms of his order 
of 20.02.2023. However, we are informed that on 
account of the delay in the emergence of the date for 
the holding of the general election, it may not be 
possible to meet the 90 day deadline stipulated by the 
Constitution. It is also the case that (possibly on 
account of a misunderstanding of the law) the Election 
Commission did not make itself available for 

                       
W.P.No.18733  of  2023 
-:5:-
consultation as required under s. 57(1) of the 2017 Act. 
The Election Commission is therefore directed to use its 
utmost efforts to immediately propose, keeping in mind 
ss. 57 and 58 of the 2017 Act, a date to the President 
that is compliant with the aforesaid deadline. If such a 
course is not available, then the Election Commission 
shall in like manner propose a date for the holding of 
the poll that deviates to the barest minimum from the 
aforesaid deadline. After consultation with the Election 
Commission the President shall announce a date for the 
holding of the general election to the Punjab Assembly. 
b. The Governor of the KPK Province must after 
consultation with the Election Commission forthwith 
appoint a date for the holding of the general election to 
the KPK Assembly and the preceding clause (a) shall, 
mutatis mutandis, apply in relation thereto.   
15. It is the constitutional duty of the Federation, in terms 
of clause (3) of Article 148, “to ensure that the 
Government of every Province is carried on in 
accordance with the provisions of the Constitution”. 
There can be no doubt that this duty includes ensuring 
that a general election to the Assembly of every Province 
is held, and enabled to be held, in a timely manner within 
the period set out in the Constitution. This duty is in 
addition to, and applies independently of, the duty cast 
under Article 220 on “all executive authorities in the 
Federation 
and 
in 
the 
Provinces 
to 
assist 
the 
Commissioner and the Election Commission in the 
discharge of his or their functions”. It follows that the 
Federation, and in particular the Federal Government, is, 
inter alia, obligated, on an immediate and urgent basis, to 
forthwith provide the Election Commission with all such 
facilities, personnel and security as it may require for the 
holding of the general elections. In like manner, it is the 
duty of the Provincial Governments, acting under the 
Caretaker Cabinets, to proactively provide all aid and 
assistance as may be required by the Election 
Commission. The duty cast upon the authorities as set out 
in s. 50 of the 2017 Act must also be discharged forthwith 
and proactively.

16. The three matters before the Court are found 
maintainable and stand disposed of as above.”  
5. 
The perusal of afore-referred order shows that the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has already issued a 
direction for conducting free and fair elections and in terms 
thereof, the Election Commission of Pakistan is authorized 
to take necessary steps for the said purpose and in 
compliance of the said order, election schedule for election 
to the Provincial Assembly of Province of Punjab has 
already been issued and notified on 08.03.2023 and Election 
Commission of Pakistan is proceeding with the matter in 
terms thereof whereby the elections are scheduled to be held 
on 30.04.2023, the said schedule is reproduced below for 
ready reference:  
“ELECTION COMMISSION OF PAKISTAN

Although, the petitioner refers to certain instances 
wherein certain incidents have taken place including the 
imposition of ban under Section 144 Cr.P.C. and also refers 
to news items that the Inspector General of Police, Punjab 
and Chief Secretary of Province of Punjab had shown their 
inability to facilitate the conduct of the elections; however, 
nothing substantial is presently available on the record to 
establish that the Election Commission of Pakistan had 

                       
W.P.No.18733  of  2023 
-:8:-
failed to implement Articles 218 and 220 of the Constitution 
and was not proceeding with the matter of conduct of 
elections in fair manner in letter and spirit. The Election 
Commission of Pakistan has not raised any plea against any 
of the officers that he/she is not helping in conducting the 
election in a proper manner or that it is not in a position to 
hold elections in a fair manner; yet if any such matter had 
arisen, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan had 
authorized the Election Commission of Pakistan to deal with 
the said matter in accordance with law.   
7. 
Presently the averments raised in the instant 
constitution petition are only based on apprehensions that 
free and fair elections shall not be conducted but no cogent 
and substantial material is available on the record to reach 
such a finding in the matter; consequently, this petition 
being pre-mature and based on apprehensions only is 
accordingly dismissed.
