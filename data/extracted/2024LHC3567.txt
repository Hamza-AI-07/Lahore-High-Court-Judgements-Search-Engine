Basis Facts 
3. 
Perusal of the contents of FIR depicts that petitioner, 
proprietor 
of 
M/s 
Hayat 
Trading 
Company, 
a 
proprietorship concern registered with the Sales Tax 
department, is accused of tax fraud, stated to be involved 
in and responsible for issuance of sale-cum-purchase 
invoices without actually effecting taxable supplies 
involving goods [in the context of Sales Tax Act 1990 bills 
issued and exchanged inter alia for carrying ghost 
transactions are classified as flying/fake invoices] and 
engaged in crediting / adjustment of inadmissible input tax. 
Evidently, adjudicatory process was carried out in terms of 
section 11 of the Act 1990 and financial loss occasioned to 
the exchequer was provisionally determined at Rs.255.000 
Million approx. It is alleged that petitioner benefited from 
tax fraud and is instrumental in extending benefits to so-
called suppliers – who adjustment jacked-up input tax 
amounts due to issuance of flying/fake invoices. 
Submissions  
4. 
Learned counsel for petitioner, at the outset, submits 
that offences alleged against the petitioner do not fall 
within the prohibitory clause in terms of sub-section (1) of 
section 497 Cr.P.C 1898. Submits that as per allegations 
flying / fake invoices were issued, which can be recovered 

Crl.Misc. No.2325-B/2024. 
 
-:3:- 
 
from bearer / holders of alleged invoices, which comprises 
of documentary evidence, and no question of any recovery 
from the person of the petitioner arises. Adds that 
petitioner had joined investigations and submitted 
statement and had already provided all available / known 
information to the Investigating Officer. Submits that 
Muhammad Sibtain Abbas was real culprit and executor of 
all underlying transactions, who misused petitioner’s 
details and password, and petitioner was neither involved 
nor had any clue of the transactions. Submits that details of 
bank accounts provided depicts that petitioner was not the 
recipient of alleged embezzled amount. Submits that FIR 
No.5/2023 has been registered against Muhammad Sibtain 
Abbas and another FIR No.02/2023 was also registered 
involving Muhammad Sibtain Abbas, hence, further 
inquiry into guilt alleged is required to plausibly connect 
the petitioner with commission of offences. Learned 
counsel cites cases reported as Kashif Anwar and others vs. The 
State (2022 YLR Note 14), Muhammad Akram Yousaf vs. The State (2022 YLR 
Note 12), Fawad Ali vs. The State and others (2016 P.Cr.L.J. 1282) and 
Muhammad Nadeem Siddiqui vs. The State through Director-General 
Intelligence and Investigation-FBR, Regional office, lahore (2008 YLR 2666). 
5. 
Conversely, case of the department advocated by 
their legal counsel is that petitioner is registered, who 
presented monthly statements / returns and information so 

Crl.Misc. No.2325-B/2024. 
 
-:4:- 
 
far gathered clearly established guilt of the petitioner, who 
is found involved in issuance of flying / fake invoices and 
adjusting of inadmissible tax. Adds that no deeper 
appreciation of allegations, at pre-arrest stage is warranted 
but for the present purposes it is enough that factum of 
ownership of business was admitted, but to avoid 
repercussions for the wrongdoing responsibility was 
shifted to Muhammad Sibtain Abbas, which lame excuse 
does not entitle petitioner to grant of pre-arrest bail. 
Tentative assessment of the material / evidence, so far 
gathered, is as follows.  
6. 
Precise allegations, attributed in the FIR, are that 
petitioner is guilty of tax fraud, who was allegedly held 
liable for issuing flying/fake invoices, without underlying 
sale/supply transactions, which acts of commission and 
omission by the accused person had been the cause and 
effect of huge financial benefits bagged by co-beneficiaries 
through unwarranted adjustment of otherwise inadmissible 
tax. Adjudicatory process, envisaged under section 11 of 
the Sales Tax Act 1990, for the determination of quantum 
of loss occasioned was carried out and consequently Sales 
tax Order in Original No.01/2023-24 dated 22.12.2023 was 
passed – petitioner alleged that order is further assailed. 
Documents showing registration and periodical submission 

Crl.Misc. No.2325-B/2024. 
 
-:5:- 
 
of Sales Tax Returns produced for inspection of the court. 
Returns depict details of Sales Tax credits and Sales Tax 
debits – which contained entries showing gross value, 
taxable value and quantum of sales tax – adjustments 
claimed in the context of interplay of input and output 
tax(es). Tax Fraud is defined in section 2(37) of the Sales 
Tax Act 1990, which inter alia categorized instances of 
falsifying or causing falsification of the invoices as 
constituent of tax fraud. In the wake of tangible evidence 
available, mere plea of shifting the entire responsibility / 
obligation, in law otherwise cast upon the petitioner, being 
a registered person, does not absolve petitioner nor entitle 
him to the grant of extra-ordinary relief – simply the 
involvement Muhammad Sibtain Abbas in other FIR’s 
does not per se substantiates innocence of the petitioner. 
Section 2(37) of the Sales Tax Act 1990 places burden of 
proof on the petitioner – that entries in the sales tax 
return(s) are lawful and outcome of lawfully conducted 
transactions. I refrain from commenting qua context of 
allegations or the effect of other criminal cases, which 
discussion may be prejudicial, at this stage. Submission 
that documentary evidence required is available and arrest 
of the petitioner is unnecessary is misconceived. Plea of 
the department is substantiated that custody of the 

Crl.Misc. No.2325-B/2024. 
 
-:6:- 
 
petitioner is essential to recover / gather further details / 
evidence – be it the computers / cellphones, data thereof 
and 
communication, 
electronically 
or 
otherwise 
[fundamental constituents of white-collar financial crime]. 
Charges against petitioner manifest abuse of value-added 
tax regime, where benefits are claimed / adjusted through 
inadmissible input tax, without carrying underlying 
supplies. Plea that embezzled amounts are not reflected in 
the statement of accounts is too simplistic an excuse, 
without appreciating that allegations were that flying / fake 
invoices were issued to jack-up ghost claims of input tax 
figures and facilitating bagging of inadmissible tax. 
Evidence available, so far gathered, is sufficient and 
reasonable to connect the petitioner with the offences same 
is charged with, which brings the case within the 
exception(s) to rebut the plea that punishments prescribed 
do not fall within the prohibitory category of offences.  
  
No plausible reasons are available to taint intended 
arrest with mala fide nor any ulterior motives, on the part 
of department, are conspicuously identifiable. Conversely, 
grant of pre-arrest bail suggests strong possibility of 
tampering with the evidence, and prejudicing / frustrating 
investigation. Elements of apparent harm / loss of liberty 
stand outweighed in the context of available incriminating 

Crl.Misc. No.2325-B/2024. 
 
-:7:- 
 
evidence, reasonably establishing involvement. Petitioner 
is not entitled to grant of extraordinary relief. Judgments 
referred are distinguishable on facts and extend no support.  
7. 
In view of afore-stated, request for grant of pre-
arrest bail is declined. Petition is dismissed and Ad-interim 
pre-arrest bail granted to the petitioner is hereby recalled.
