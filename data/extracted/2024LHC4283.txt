Date of Hearing

For the petitioner 
Mr. Mumtaz-ul-Hassan, Advocate 
For the  
Respondents/PRA  
Mr. Abdul Muqtadir Khan, Advocate.    
 
 
                  Raheel Kamran J:- The sole cause which has 
been made basis to invoke jurisdiction of this Court under Article 
199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
(‘Constitution’) is the condition imposed by the Appellate Tribunal, 
Punjab Revenue Authority, Lahore (Bench-II) vide order dated 
07.08.2024 to deposit one third (1/3rd) of the disputed amount of 
withholding tax within 30 days from the date of that order.  
2.      While referring to the provisions of section 67 of the Punjab 
Sales Tax on Services Act, 2012 (‘the Act’), learned counsel for the 
petitioner contends that the power to grant stay is unhindered and the 
same cannot be circumvented by imposing the impugned condition.   
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondents/Punjab 
Revenue Authority (PRA) has objected to maintainability of the 
petition on the ground that alternate remedy of Tax Reference before 
this Court is available under section 67A of the Act against the 
impugned conditional order, therefore, the titled petition is not 
maintainable.  He maintains that the impugned order, being 
interlocutory in nature, is not amenable to jurisdiction under Article 

2 
W.P.No.48782 of 2024 
199 of the Constitution.  In support of said contention, reliance has 
been placed in the case of President, All Pakistan Women 
Association1.  He finally contends that the titled petition must fail 
even on merit for the reason that the Appellate Tribunal is possessed 
of discretionary power to stay recovery of any tax due by virtue of 
any order being assailed, subject to restrictions or limitations and 
that the impugned condition in the instant case depicts only 
reasonable exercise of judicial discretion. 
4. 
In rebuttal to the above, learned counsel for the petitioner 
contends that petition in hand is clearly maintainable and remedy of 
Tax Reference under section 67A of the Act is available only when 
question of law is involved in a case arising from the decision or 
final order passed by the Appellate Tribunal in the appeal preferred. 
5. 
Heard. 
6. 
In order to properly appreciate respective contentions of 
learned counsel for the parties, the relevant provisions i.e. sections 
67, 67A & 68 of the Act are reproduced herein below: - 
67. Disposal of appeals by the Appellate Tribunal.– (1) The 
Appellate Tribunal may, before disposing of an appeal, call for 
such particulars, documents, records or information as it may 
require in respect of the matters arising from the appeal or 
cause further inquiry to be made by the officer of the Authority. 
      (2)  The Appellate Tribunal shall afford an opportunity of 
being heard to the parties to the appeal and, in case of default 
by any of the parties on the date of hearing, the Tribunal may, if 
it deems fit, dismiss the appeal in default, or may proceed ex-
parte to decide the appeal on the basis of the available record 
but the Appellate Tribunal shall decide the appeal within six 
months from the date of filing of the appeal. 
      (3)  The Appellate Tribunal may stay the recovery of any tax 
due by virtue of the decision or order being appealed against 
and any such order made by the Appellate Tribunal shall remain 
operative for no more than thirty days during which period a 
notice shall be issued to the respondent and after hearing the 
parties, the order staying recovery may be confirmed, varied or 
vacated as the Appellate Tribunal deems fit but the stay order so 
confirmed or varied shall remain operative for not more than 
ninety days including any period for which the recovery may 
                                                 
1  President, All Pakistan Women Association, Peshawar Cantt. vs. Muhammad Akbar Awan    
    and others (2020 SCMR 260) 

3 
W.P.No.48782 of 2024 
have been stayed prior to the confirmation or variation of the 
stay order. 
      (4)  In deciding the appeal, the Appellate Tribunal may, 
without prejudice to the powers specified in sub-section (2), 
make an order to– 
(a)  affirm, modify or annul the order being appealed 
against; or 
(b)  remand the case to the officer or the Commissioner 
(Appeals) for making such inquiry or taking such action 
as the Tribunal may direct. 
      (5)  The Appellate Tribunal shall not increase the amount of 
any tax payable, penalty or default surcharge unless the 
taxpayer has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing 
cause against such increase. 
      (6)  The Appellate Tribunal shall communicate its order to 
the taxpayer and the Commissioner. 
      (7)  Save as provided in any other law, the decision of the 
Appellate Tribunal on an appeal shall be final. 
 
67A. Reference to the High Court.– (1) A reference to the High 
Court shall lie only if a question of law is involved in a case.  
      (2)  Notwithstanding anything contained in section 67, a 
taxpayer or the officer not below the rank of Additional 
Commissioner, aggrieved by any decision or order of the 
Appellate Tribunal may, within sixty days of communication of 
such decision or order, prefer a reference, in the prescribed 
form, along with a statement of the facts of the case and the 
question of law involved in that case to the Lahore High Court 
Lahore. 
      (3)  The reference under this section shall be heard by a 
Bench of at least two Judges of the High Court and the 
provisions of section 98 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 (V 
of 1908) shall apply mutatis mutandis to such reference.   
      (4)  The High Court shall send a copy of its judgment under 
the seal of the Court to the Appellate Tribunal. 
      (5)  Notwithstanding a reference preferred in the High Court 
under this section, the tax shall be paid in accordance with the 
order of the Appellate Tribunal. 
      (6)  If the tax liability is reduced by the High Court and the 
Authority decides to seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court, 
the Authority may, within thirty days of the receipt of the 
judgment in the reference, apply to the High Court to postpone 
the refund of tax until the decision by the Supreme Court.   
      (7)  Section 5 of the Limitation Act 1908 (IX of 1908) shall 
apply to a reference under this section. 
      (8)  A court fee of rupees one thousand shall be paid for a 
reference under this section except when it is filed by the 
Authority. 
 
68. Deposit of the tax demand while appeal is pending.– Where 
in any appeal, the decision or order appealed against relates to 
any tax demanded under this Act, the person who has filed the 
appeal shall, pending the appeal, deposit the admitted amount of 

4 
W.P.No.48782 of 2024 
the tax based on the return filed under section 35 or as may be 
determined by the Commissioner (Appeals) or the Appellate 
Tribunal where such return has not been filed. 
 
7. 
The remedy of Tax Reference to the High Court is envisaged 
in section 67A of the Act.  From perusal of sub-section (2) of section 
67A of the Act, it is abundantly clear that a taxpayer or the officer 
not below the rank of an Additional Commissioner, who is aggrieved 
by any decision or order of the Appellate Tribunal which has been 
communicated to him or her, may prefer a Tax Reference before this 
Court within sixty days of the date of such communication. 
Obligation of the Appellate Tribunal to communicate its order is 
specified in sub-section (6) of section 67 of the Act which is 
confined to decision of an appeal by the Appellate Tribunal and 
makes no reference to any interlocutory order passed therein.  In 
other words, no Tax Reference under section 67A of the Act is 
maintainable against an order which is not required by law to be 
communicated by the Appellate Tribunal. Therefore, plea of the 
petitioner that the impugned order, which is essentially of interim 
nature, was not assailable in jurisdiction of this Court reserved for 
Tax Reference, carries weight2.     
8. 
As regards the other objection qua maintainability of the writ 
petition against an interlocutory order, suffice it to observe that there 
is no absolute bar on entertaining a petition under Article 199 of the 
Constitution against an order which is interlocutory in nature, if the 
same is corum non judice or without jurisdiction.  Indeed, such 
constitutional jurisdiction is equitable and discretionary in nature 
which should sparingly be exercised to interfere whenever an interim 
order is challenged. Such judicial policy is meant to curtail delays, 
piecemeal and fractured litigation at various fora at the same time.  
However, in exceptional circumstances, such as cases involving a 
flagrant violation of law, a clear wrongful exercise of jurisdiction or 
a manifest and grave injustice, intervention of this Court in 
                                                 
2   Commissioner Inland Revenue, Zone-V vs. Messrs T.N.W. Engineering Works  
    (2019 PTD 46) 

5 
W.P.No.48782 of 2024 
interlocutory orders may be warranted on application of an aggrieved 
person where the law applicable provides no other remedy3.  In the 
instant case, the impugned condition has been assailed on the 
grounds of having been imposed illegally and without lawful 
authority while curtailing the petitioner’s right of access to justice, 
therefore, the same warrants consideration. 
 
Reliance of learned counsel for the respondents/PRA on the 
case of President, All Pakistan Women Association (supra) is 
misconceived inasmuch as there was an ouster of jurisdiction clause 
under section 24(4) of the Cantonment Rent Restrictions Act, 1963 
qua remedy of appeal against interlocutory orders.   The Supreme 
Court of Pakistan, while refusing to grant leave to appeal in that 
case, observed that where a legislature has expressly barred a remedy 
which is not available to a party under the statute, it cannot be sought 
indirectly by resort to the constitutional jurisdiction of the High 
Court.  In the instant case, however, there is no ouster clause in the 
Act.  Undisputedly, there is no remedy of appeal provided in the Act 
against an interlocutory order passed by the Appellate Tribunal.  If 
any order is passed by the Appellate Tribunal in flagrant violation of 
law, in the absence of an alternate remedy, the same may be assailed 
by an aggrieved party in constitutional jurisdiction under Article 199.   
9. 
Appellate Tribunal is the first extra-departmental/independent 
forum for adjudication of disputes qua tax liability under the Act.  
Historically, in recognition of the principle of unhindered access to 
justice, this Court as well as other High Courts have been staying 
recovery of any tax demanded by the concerned revenue authorities 
till decision of appeal before at least one extra-departmental forum4.  
The provincial legislature has by and large manifestly adhered to the

 others (2024 PTD 30) 

6 
W.P.No.48782 of 2024 
same principle while enacting section 67 of the Act for disposal of 
appeals by the Appellate Tribunal.  Sub-section (3) of section 67 of 
the Act empowers the Appellate Tribunal to stay recovery of tax due 
by virtue of the decision appealed against.  Subject to section 68 of 
the Act, there is no clog on the power of the Appellate Tribunal 
under section 67(3) of the Act to stay recovery of the total amount of 
tax demanded pursuant to the order appealed against.  There are, 
however, other limitations specified in the said provision such as 
period of 30 days within which ex-parte order qua stay of recovery 
can remain operative and during the said period a notice has to be 
issued to the respondent and after hearing the parties, the order 
staying recovery may be confirmed, varied or vacated as the 
Tribunal deems fit but the stay order so confirmed or varied can 
remain operative for not more than ninety days including any period 
for which the recovery may have been stayed prior to confirmation 
or variation of the stay order.   
10. 
Section 68 of the Act governs deposit of the tax determined 
while appeal is pending.  That provision postulates that the person 
who has filed appeal is required, pending the appeal, to deposit the 
admitted amount of tax based on the return filed under section 35 or 
as may be determined by the Commissioner (Appeals) or the 
Appellate Tribunal where such return has not been filed.  In other 
words, authority of the Appellate Tribunal to grant stay against 
recovery of the total amount of tax is curtailed or restricted by the 
requirements to deposit, during pendency of the appeal, the admitted 
amount of tax or the amount determined by the Commissioner 
(Appeals) and the Appellate Tribunal.  The above restrictions or 
limitations specified in section 68 ibid are not similar to sub-sections 
(5) & (6) of section 67A of the Act that mandate the tax to be paid in 
accordance with the order of the Appellate Tribunal assailed therein 
during pendency of the Tax Reference and apply for refund if the tax 
liability is ultimately reduced by the High Court or until the decision 
by the Supreme Court.  However, while an appeal is pending before 

7 
W.P.No.48782 of 2024 
it under section 67 of the Act, an Appellate Tribunal is empowered 
under section 68 ibid to compel deposit of only such amount of tax 
demanded under the Act which falls within the following three 
categories:  
i) 
the admitted amount of the tax based on the return filed 
under section 35 of the Act 
ii) 
the amount of tax determined by the Commissioner 
(Appeals) 
 
iii) 
the amount of tax determined by the Appellate Tribunal 
  
 
 
11. 
No legal exception can possibly be taken to the requirement 
under section 68 ibid qua deposit of any admitted amount of tax 
based on the return filed under section 35 of the Act or the amount of 
tax so determined by Appellate Tribunal. To that extent, the mandate 
of recovery imposed by section 68 of the Act casts only reasonable 
restriction on authority of the Appellate Tribunal to stay recovery of 
such amount of tax and such restriction or limitation does not 
undermine the rights of access to justice and the fair trail right 
enshrined in Article 10A of the Constitution. However, on literal 
construction of section 68 ibid, the requirement to compel deposit of 
the amount of tax determined by the Commissioner (Appeals) pose a 
number of problems: firstly, such construction would render 
redundant the authority of Appellate Tribunal under section 67(3) of 
the Act to stay recovery of the tax pursuant to the order being 
appealed against; secondly, if such amount of tax is compelled to be 
deposited at the stage of pendency of appeal before the Appellate 
Tribunal, it may also render the provision of sub-section (5) of 
section 67A of the Act superfluous; thirdly, the requirement of 
deposit of tax in such manner before determination of liability by the 
first extra- departmental/independent forum i.e. the Appellate 
Tribunal may be treated as unreasonable restriction on the right of 
access to justice and fair trial right embodied in Article 10A of the 
Constitution; and finally, determination of the tax amount by the 
Commissioner (Appeals) cannot ordinarily be equated with the 
determination made by the Appellate Tribunal, therefore, to that 

8 
W.P.No.48782 of 2024 
extent literal construction of section 68 of the Act would render it ex 
facie discriminatory as the discrimination in such a case ensues from 
the lack of classification and similar treatment extended to 
dissimilarly or differently placed appellants5. At the same time, 
redundancy cannot be attributed to the legislative expression in 
section 68 ibid qua deposit tax pursuant to determination made by 
the Commissioner (Appeals).  
12. 
It is trite law that any construction which renders the statute or 
any of its sections or components redundant or superfluous should be 
avoided and must be so construed as to make it effective or 
operative.6  It is equally well settled that all efforts should be made to 
apply and adhere to the rules of harmonious construction so that 
allegedly conflicting provisions should be reconciled and saved 
rather than rendered redundant.7 Theory of reading down is another 
rule of interpretation resorted to whenever a statutory provision, 
when read literally, leads to any violation of a fundamental right, or 
renders it without legislative competence and Court reads such 
provision narrowly to save it from invalidity8.  These principles are 
squarely applicable in the instant case.  Therefore, to avoid 
redundancy, foster harmony and circumvent repugnancy to 
constitutional guarantees, as explained herein above, section 68 of 
the Act is construed narrowly and read down to the extent of 
condition qua deposit of the amount of tax determined by the

W.P.No.48782 of 2024 
Commissioner (Appeals) in the manner that recovery of only such 
amount of tax shall be compelled as has been determined on the 
basis of judicial precedent(s) of this Court or the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan settling the controversy raised.  
13. 
From perusal of the impugned order, it is manifest that while 
imposing condition of deposit of 1/3rd amount of tax for stay against 
recovery of the remaining amount, no reason has been advanced by 
the Appellate Tribunal. There is nothing in the order explaining if 
such condition has been inflicted on the basis of any admission or 
determination qua tax liability of the petitioner. The impugned 
condition has been evidently imposed in a slipshod manner that 
hardly shows any application of mind and fulfilment of the 
requirements prescribed in section 68 of the Act. It can, therefore, be 
safely concluded that the impugned condition qua deposit of 1/3rd 
amount of tax has been foisted arbitrarily, without lawful authority 
and the same is of no legal effect.   
14. 
For the foregoing reasons, this constitutional petition is 
allowed, the impugned condition qua deposit of 1/3rd amount of tax 
is set aside. The Appellate Tribunal is directed to decide appeal of 
the petitioner within the period of ninety days specified in section 
67(3) of the Act. There shall be no order as to costs.
