MASUD ABID NAQVI, J.  
Brief 
facts 
of 
this 
civil 
revision are that the plaintiff/petitioner filed a suit for specific 
performance of an agreement to sell with the averments that 
he entered into an agreement dated 01.03.2017 with 
respondent/defendants 
for 
purchase 
of 
land 
properly 
mentioned in plaint, situated in Chak No.6/GB Faisalabad for 
a sale consideration of Rs.70,00,000/- per acre and paid 
Rs.40,00,000/- as an earnest amount. The date for completion 
of agreement was settled as 01.03.2018.  The plaintiff 
arranged 
the 
balance 
sale 
consideration 
amount 
of 
Rs.1,28,72,865/- and contacted the defendants/respondent to 
comply with the terms of agreement, however, the respondent/ 
defendants refused, which necessitated filing of instant suit. 

C.R. No.42583 of 2022

The defendants/respondent contested the suit by raising 
preliminary objections.  The learned trial Court vide order 
dated 23.11.2021 directed the plaintiff/ petitioner to deposit 
the remaining sale consideration amount but the plaintiff/ 
petitioner failed to comply with the court’s order and 
ultimately on 19.02.2022 learned trial Court dismissed the suit 
due to non-deposit of remaining consideration amount in the 
court. Against that order, the plaintiff/petitioner filed an 
appeal and the same was dismissed vide ex-parte judgment 
and decree dated 24.05.2022.  Feeling aggrieved, the 
petitioner/plaintiff has filed the instant civil revision and 
challenged the validity of the judgments and decree passed by 
the learned courts below. 
2. 
I have heard the arguments of the learned counsel for 
the parties and perused the available record as well as have 
minutely gone through the impugned judgments and decree of 
learned courts below. 
3. 
Perusal of record reveals that plaintiff/petitioner filed a 
suit for specific performance of an agreement to sell against 
the defendants No.1 and 2 and learned trial court directed the 
plaintiff/petitioner on 23.11.2021 to deposit balance sale 
consideration amount but the plaintiff/ petitioner failed to 
deposit the same till 19.02.2022.  On 19.02.2022, learned 
counsel for plaintiff/petitioner recorded statement and 
withdrew the suit to the extent of defendant No.1 namely 
Shaukat Ali but the learned trial court passed the impugned 

C.R. No.42583 of 2022 
                                                         3 
 
 
judgment and decree dated 19.02.2022 and dismissed 
plaintiff’s suit for non-deposit of balance total sale 
consideration amount of Rs.1,28,72,865/-.  After the statement 
of learned counsel of plaintiff/petitioner for withdrawal of suit 
to the extent of defendant No.1, the learned trial court  was 
under the legal obligation to deduct the amount as is attributed 
to defendant No.1 and should have directed the plaintiff/ 
petitioner to deposit the specific amount to the extent of share 
of defendant No.2/respondent namely Muhammad Ali and 
with assistance of both the learned counsels for the parties, 
said amount is computed as Rs.80,93,750/-.  Instead of passing 
any order to clarify the specific balance sale consideration 
amount by deducting the amount to the extent of share of 
defendant No.1, learned trial court passed the judgment for not 
depositing the total consideration amount of Rs.1,28,72,865/-. 
It is also important to mention here that learned trial court 
failed to pass an order for deposit of specific remaining 
amount alongwith the consequences of non-compliance of the 
order with clarity in advance before passing the impugned 
judgment and decree dated 19.02.022 and learned appellate 
court has also failed to appreciate the above mentioned facts 
while dismissing the plaintiff/petitioner’s appeal.   The order 
passed by the learned civil judge as discussed above clearly 
indicates that neither the learned civil judge computed the 
correct balance sale consideration to be deposited by the 
plaintiff/petitioner 
nor 
passed 
any 
order 
alongwith 

C.R. No.42583 of 2022 
                                                         4 
 
 
consequences of non-compliance of the order with clarity in 
advance before passing the impugned judgment and decree. In 
this regard, guidance is provided in recent judgment of the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan reported as Messrs DW 
Pakistan (Private) Limited Lahore Vs Begum Anisa Fazl-I-
Mahmood (2023 SCMR 555 ), wherein the August Supreme 
Court, after discussing plethora of judgments of the Hon’ble 
Superior Courts has held as under:-  
“While passing the order for deposit of sale 
consideration or balance sale consideration by 
the trial court, some reasonable time to deposit 
the money in court should also be afforded for 
compliance 
of 
the 
order 
alongwith 
the 
consequences of non-compliance of the order 
with clarity in advance.”   
 
4. 
In view of the above discussion, this civil revision is 
accepted and the impugned judgments and decrees of the 
learned courts below are set-aside and the lis is remanded 
back to the learned trial court for decision afresh. The 
petitioner/plaintiff is also directed to deposit balance sale 
consideration amount of Rs.80,93,750/- before the learned 
trial court within 03-Weeks and in case of failure of plaintiff/ 
petitioner to deposit the said balance sale consideration 
amount, within specified period, suit of the plaintiff/petitioner 
shall be dismissed due to non-deposit of remaining 
consideration in court. The contesting parties are directed to 
appear before the learned Senior Civil Judge (civil
