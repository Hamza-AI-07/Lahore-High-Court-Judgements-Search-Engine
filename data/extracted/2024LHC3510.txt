Petitioner by: 
 
 
Syed Zulfiqar Ali Shah, 
learned Advocate. 
 
Respondent No. 3 by: 
 
Syed Muhammad Shah, 
learned Advocate. 
 
 
Respondent No. 4 by: 
Rana Zahid Nasim Shahid,

      Sultan Tanvir Ahmad, J:– Through 
present petition, filed under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan-1973, final 
order dated 11.04.2022 passed by the learned Special 
Judge Rent, Gujranwala (the ‘Rent Tribunal’)  as well 
as judgment dated 04.07.2022 passed by the learned 
Additional District Judge, Gujranwala have been 
challenged.  
2.   
The facts, necessary for decision of the 
present petition, are that respondent No. 3 / Jamia 
Masjid Insar-ul-Islam instituted ejectment-petition 

 
Writ Petition No.47196-2022                                   
 
 
    2 
against present petitioner with respect to two shops 
measuring 15 x 10 sq. ft. bearing No. BII-16S-13 and 
BII-8S-33 (the ‘premises’) on the ground of default. 
Leave to appear and defend the ejectment-petition was 
allowed on 23.06.2016. The relevant issues were 
framed and the parties led their respective evidence. 
Through final order dated 11.04.2022 the learned Rent 
Tribunal allowed the ejectment-petition and granted 
following relief:- 
 
 
 
 
a)  The respondent is directed to hand over 
the vacant possession of rented shops, to 
the petitioner within the period of thirty 
days failing which the right of petitioner to 
prefer execution petition is intact. 
 
 
b)  It is also admitted fact that the respondent 
has not paid rent to mosque since July 
2015. The petitioner has stated that the 
respondent agreed in June 2015, to pay 
monthly rent Rs.50000/- but the petitioner 
remained failed to establish this fact 
through sound and cogent evidence. 
Therefore, the petitioner is entitled to 
receive monthly rent as per receipts of 
year 2014 Mark-H, Mark-G with ten year 
percent annual increase starting from July 
2015 till the eviction of respondent. 
 
3.    
Aggrieved from the same, rent appeal No. 08 
of 2022 was instituted by the petitioner, which was 
dismissed vide judgment dated 04.07.2022; hence 
present petition. 
4.   
Syed Zulfiqar Ali Shah, learned counsel for 
the petitioner has pressed this petition, inter alia, on the 
ground that the premises belongs to respondent No. 4 / 
Evacuee Trust Property Board. He submitted that under 
section 8 of the Evacuee Trust Properties (Management 
and Disposal) Act, 1975 (the ‘Act of 1975’) declaration 
is to be made by the Chairman with respect to the 

 
Writ Petition No.47196-2022                                   
 
 
    3 
premises and in this respect the proceedings have been 
initiated in which evidence is being recorded. He also 
submitted that the learned Rent Tribunal has no 
jurisdiction to entertain ejectment-petition under section 
19 of Punjab Rented Premises Act, 2009 (the ‘Act’). In 
course of arguments, learned counsel also relied upon 
section 2(a) and 2(f) of the Act and stated that the 
ejectment against place of religious worship is not 
maintainable. He has added that the property since is 
owned by the Evacuee Trust, therefore, no Court within 
the Province has any authority to adjudicate upon such 
disputes. Learned counsel for the petitioner has relied 
upon some documents in order to convince that learned 
two Courts below have misread the evidence. 
5.   
Syed Muhammad Shah, learned counsel for 
respondent No. 3 / Jamia Masjid Insar-ul-Islam, invited 
the attention of this Court towards various parts of the 
evidence and supported the judgment as well as the 
final order passed by the learned two Courts below.   
6.   
I have heard the arguments and record has 
been perused with the able assistance of learned counsel 
for the parties. 
7.    
The tenancy agreement dated 03.05.1981 is 
on the record as Exh.A-8, which is executed by 
Muhammad Younas (father of the petitioner) in favour 
of ejectment-petitioner. In course of cross-examination, 
the petitioner / RW-1 admitted that prior to petitioner, 
his father namely Muhammad Younas was tenant in the 
premises. In response to another question he stated that 
he has no knowledge about the fact that his father has 
obtained the premises from the ejectment-petitioner. He 
further denied, for want of knowledge, that the rent of 

 
Writ Petition No.47196-2022                                   
 
 
    4 
the premises was used to be paid to the ejectment-
petitioner since 2015.    
8.   
Learned counsel for the petitioner made 
reference to Ex.R-2 and claimed that the petitioner is 
tenant of respondent No. 4, however, it is observed that 
the said document is prepared on 05.05.2016 i.e. after 
the ejectment-petition was filed. The petitioner, in his 
evidence, has even denied having any knowledge as to 
amount paid to respondent No. 4 at the time of alleged 
execution of Ex.R-2. He also admitted that one Haji 
Muhammad Yaqoob (real uncle of the petitioner) was 
President of the mosque committee but then again 
denied for want of knowledge that the said Haji 
Muhammad Yaqoob gave the premises to the 
predecessor of the petitioner, on rent. Reading of 
evidence has left no doubt in my mind that the 
predecessor of the petitioner entered into rent 
agreement (Ex.A-8) with the ejectment-petitioner.  
9.   
The petitioner asserted that instead of 
ejectment-petitioner, respondent No. 4 is the actual 
owner. In this respect Constitution petition No. 15127 
of 2016 has already been decided, which was contested 
by respondent No. 4 as well. After hearing the parties, 
on 02.05.2018 this Court reached to the conclusion that 
factual controversy is involved vis-à-vis the ownership 
dispute which cannot be resolved without recording of 
evidence. The relevant part of order dated 02.05.2018 
passed in petition No. 15127 of 2016 reads as under:- 
“...meaning 
thereby 
some 
factual 
controversy is involved in the matter in 
hand, which cannot be considered and 
dilated 
upon 
in 
exercise 
of 
writ 
jurisdiction, because it needs thorough 
scrutiny and recording of evidence…”

10.   
Learned 
counsel 
for 
the 
parties 
have 
confirmed that the above order was never assailed and 
instead a reference has been filed by respondent No. 4 
with respect to several shops, including the premises, 
which is admittedly pending before the Chairman of the 
Evacuee Trust Property Board. In this reference, it is 
prayed to formally declare the premises as evacuee 
property. It has been further apprised that evidence is 
being led by the relevant parties in the said reference.  
11.   
It is also noticed that the petitioner filed a suit 
titled “Waheed Younas versus Excise Department etc.” 
in the year 2015 claiming to be the owner of the 
premises. The petitioner cannot be allowed to adopt two 
different versions in two different cases, which is hit by 
principle of approbate and reprobate. In one case he 
has pleaded himself to be the owner of the premises and 
in the ejectment-petition he has taken the defense quite 
contrary to the above.  
12.   
Section 2(d) of the Act reads as follows:- 
"(d)...."landlord" means the owner of a 
premises and includes a person for the 
time being entitled or authorized to receive 
rent in respect of the premises;" 
 
The above reflects that the Act admits two categories 
for the present purposes; (i) the actual owner and (ii) a 
person for the time being entitled or authorized to 
receive the rent. Ex.A-8 and other evidence on record 
reflect that ejectment-petitioner was authorized to 
collect rent of the premises and the petitioner defaulted 
in the payment of rent that he had undertaken in the 
tenancy agreement. The dispute of ownership, between 
ejectment-petitioner / Jamia Masjid Insar-ul-Islam and 
respondent No. 4, is being determined by the forum 

 
Writ Petition No.47196-2022                                   
 
 
    6 
having authority to record evidence. Hardly any doubt 
is left that ejectment-petitioner is the one who for the 
time being was receiving rent with respect to the 
premises. No benefit can be given to petitioner for the 
dispute of ejectment-petitioner and respondent No. 4. It 
is also observed that respondent No. 4 has been 
impleaded in the array of parties despite the fact that his 
application under Order I, Rule 10 of the Civil 
Procedure Code, 1908 was dismissed by the learned 
Rent Tribunal. Learned counsel for the petitioner has 
failed to show from the record if this order (dated 
13.03.2017) passed by the learned Rent Tribunal was 
assailed in appeal. It appears that without seeking 
permission of this Court respondent No. 4 has been 
impleaded as a party to further confuse the situation. 
13.   
There are certain other submissions made by 
parties with respect to the dispute of the ownership. I 
would not like to make any observation in this regard as 
the same can prejudice the findings of the learned 
forum resolving the same. Even otherwise, the purpose 
of the Act is to regulate the tenancy disputes and the 
learned two Courts below have correctly observed that 
the Rent Tribunals do not have any mandate to resolve 
the question of ownership.  
14.   
Now I would like to address the last argument 
of the learned counsel for the petitioner. He has relied 
upon section 2(a) and 2(f) of the Act and stated that the 
Rent Tribunals do not have jurisdiction to adjudicate 
upon the matters pertaining to ‘any place of religious 
worship’. These provisions read as under:- 
 
 
2. Definitions.- 
(a) "building" means a building or part 
thereof, together with all fixtures and 

 
Writ Petition No.47196-2022                                   
 
 
    7 
fittings therein, if any, and includes any 
garage, garden, godown, out house and 
open space attached or appurtenant 
thereto, let out for residential or non 
residential purpose, whether actually 
being used for that purpose or not, but 
does not include a room in a hotel, hostel, 
boarding house, guest house or any place 
of religious worship; 
(b) xxx 
(c) xxx 
(d) xxx 
(e) xxx 
(f) "premises" means a building or rented 
land not being an agricultural land or land 
subservient to agriculture; 
 
 
        (Emphasis supplied) 
  
 
The Act provides that application in respect of 
rented premises shall be filed in the Rent Tribunal for 
the settlement of the disputes in an expeditious manner. 
Section 2(f) of the Act defines “premises” as a 
“building” or rented land not being an agriculture land 
or subservient to agriculture. The word “building” is 
defined in section 2(a) of the Act as building or part 
thereof, together with all fixtures and fittings therein, if 
any, and includes any garage, garden, godown, out 
house and open space attached or appurtenant thereto, 
let out for residential or non residential purpose, 
whether actually being used for that purpose or not. 
However, room in a hotel, hostel, boarding house, guest 
house or any place of religious worship are excluded. 
The words ‘any place of religious worship’ by no 
means can be stretched to a premises or building that is 
being used for a commercial purpose. Admittedly, the 
premises in question are shops, being used for 
commercial purpose. Reading of the reproduced 
provisions of law, relied by the learned counsel for the 
petitioner as well as other provisions of the Act, clearly 

 
Writ Petition No.47196-2022                                   
 
 
    8 
reveal that any property, space or premises let out for 
the purpose of business or trade are not intended to be 
excluded from the definition of building or for that 
matter premises, thus, the objection of the learned 
counsel for the petitioner as to maintainability of the 
ejectment-petition, is rejected. 
15.   
In the wake of above discussion, I am of the 
opinion that no mistake is made by the learned Courts 
below. Therefore, the present petition is dismissed. No 
order as to costs. Learned counsel for respondent No. 3, 
upon instructions, has stated that respondent No. 3 has 
no objection if the petitioner is allowed to retain the 
possession of the premises for four months from today, 
therefore, the petitioner if so advised, can retain the 
possession subject to payment of monthly rent as 
already determined by the learned Courts below. 
16.   
Observation(s) made above or made by the 
learned two Courts below are only in order to resolve 
the dispute of tenancy and the same shall not be 
considered by the learned forum resolving the dispute 
as to the ownership between Evacuee Trust Property 
Board and respondent No. 3.
