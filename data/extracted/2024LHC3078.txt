MIRZA VIQAS RAUF, J. This petition under Article 199 
of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
(hereinafter referred to as “Constitution”) primarily challenges the 
vires of order dated 19th December, 2023, whereby learned Judge 
Family Court, Rawalpindi, on failure of reconciliation proceedings, 
proceeded to decree the suit for dissolution of marriage on the basis 
of khula, instituted by respondent No.4 (hereinafter referred to as 
“respondent”). The petitioner also calls in question the vires of 
proviso to Sub-Sections 4 & 5 of Section 10 of the Family Courts 
Act, 1964 (hereinafter referred to as “Act, 1964”), being contrary to 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-2- 
 
Articles 4, 8, 9 and 10-A of the “Constitution”. In view of questions 
raised in this petition, it was admitted for regular hearing by way of 
order dated 23rd January, 2024 and notice under Order XXVII-A of 
the Civil Procedure Code (V of 1908) was also issued to the learned 
Advocate General, Punjab. For the purpose of ease of reference, 
order is reproduced below:- 
“The petitioner was married with respondent No.4. On account of 
some differences, respondent No.4 instituted a suit for dissolution 
of marriage on the basis of Khula, which was decreed by way of 
order dated 19th December, 2023 on failure of reconciliation 
proceedings. 
 
2.  
Learned counsel for the petitioner inter-alia contends that 
section 10 of the Family Courts Act, 1964 provides detailed 
procedure for the purpose of reconciliation between the spouses. 
She adds that the marriage was dissolved on the basis of Khula in 
a mechanical manner through impugned order. Submits that before 
passing a decree for dissolution of marriage on the basis of Khula, 
it was obligatory for the Family Court to hold reconciliation 
proceedings in an effective manner and also seek the consent and 
willingness of husband before passing the decree for Khula. 
Learned counsel emphasizes that the Family Courts are dissolving 
the marriages on the basis of Khula in haphazard manner, which is 
against the Islamic injunctions. Contends that the proviso to sub-
section 4 and subsection 5 of section 10 of the Family Courts Act, 
1964 are contrary to Articles 4, 8, 9 and 10-A of the Constitution of 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. In order to supplement her 
contentions, learned counsel places reliance on SALEEM AHMAD 
and others v. GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN through Attorney 
General of Pakistan and 2 others (PLD 2014 Federal Shariat 
Court 43) and FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN v. AITZAZ AHSAN 
and another (PLD 1989 Supreme Court 61). 
3.  
Points raised need consideration. Admit. Notice. Since vires 
of sub-Sections 4 and 5 of section 10 of the Family Courts Act, 
1964 are in question, so notice under section XXVIIA of the Code 
of Civil Procedure (V of 1908) be also issued to the learned 
Advocate General, Punjab.” 
2.  
Before moving further, it would be apposite to have a preview 
of necessary facts giving rise to this petition. The petitioner was 
married to the “respondent” on 14th February, 2002 according to 
Shariat Muhammadi and dower was fixed as Rs.50,000/- in the shape 
of gold ornaments. The spouses were blessed with three children, 
however, on account of some differences, “respondent” instituted a 
suit for dissolution of marriage on the basis of khula. On failure of 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-3- 
 
reconciliation proceedings, suit was decreed by way of order dated 
19th December, 2023, hence this petition. 
3.  
Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that marriage is 
sacred relationship and every possible effort should be made to keep 
it intact. She also made reference to Ayat No.229 of Surah 
Al-Baqarah. Learned counsel emphasized that reconciliation in 
terms of Section 10 of the “Act, 1964” should be meaningful and 
marriage cannot be dissolved in a mechanical manner. It is contended 
with vehemence that before passing a decree for dissolution of 
marriage on the basis of khula, it is obligatory for the Family Court 
to hold reconciliation proceedings in an effective manner and also 
seek consent and willingness of the husband. Learned counsel 
emphasized that impugned order in the circumstances is not tenable 
under the law. Learned counsel, in the last, submitted that she would 
not challenge the vires of the law and to that extent does not press 
this petition. Placed reliance on SALEEM AHMAD and others v. 
GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN through Attorney General of 
Pakistan and 2 others (PLD 2014 Federal Shariat Court 43) and 
FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN v. AITZAZ AHSAN and another 
(PLD 1989 Supreme Court 61). 
4.  
Mr. Khalid Ishaq, learned Advocate General, Punjab on the 
other hand submitted that marriage between Muslims can be 
dissolved by three modes i.e. Talaq, Mubarat and khula. Added that 
Talaq is an arbitrary and unilateral act of the husband, whereby he 
may divorce his wife whereas through Mubarat, spouses may agree 
to dissolution of marriage by their mutual consent. Learned 
Advocate General maintained that as to the right of divorce accorded 
to a man, a Muslim woman is granted the right to obtain divorce 
through khula by filing a suit in the court of law. Learned Advocate 
General also made reference to Section 2 of The Dissolution of 
Muslim Marriages Act, 1939, with the contention that it outlines the 
grounds on which a Muslim woman can seek a decree for dissolution 
of her marriage. In the last, learned Advocate General submitted that 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-4- 
 
no yardstick can be laid to regulate the reconciliation proceedings 
before the Family Court. In support of his contentions, learned 
Advocate General, made reference to Syed AMIR RAZA versus Mst. 
ROHI MUMTAZ and others (2023 SCMR 1394), Mst. KHURSHID 
BIBI versus Baboo MUHAMMAD AMIN (PLD 1967 Supreme 
Court 97), Mst. BALQIS FATIMA versus NAJM-UL-IKRAM 
QURESHI 
(PLD 
1959 
(W.P.) 
Lahore 
566), 
Dr. 
MAHMOOD-UR-RAHMAN FAISAL versus GOVERNMENT OF 
PAKISTAN through Secretary, Ministry of Justice, Law and 
Parliamentary Affairs, Islamabad (PLD 1994 Supreme Court 607), 
LIAQAT ALI versus DISTRICT COLLECTOR, GUJRAT and 4 
others (2022 MLD 1195), SALEEM AHMAD and others versus 
GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN through Attorney General of 
Pakistan and 2 others (PLD 2014 Federal Shariat Court 43), 
ABDUL RAHIM versus Mst. SHAHIDA KHAN (PLD 1984 Supreme 
Court 329), IMRAN ANWAR KHAN and others versus PROVINCE 
OF THE PUNJAB through Secretary Ministry of Law, Lahore and 
others (PLD 2022 Federal Shariat Court 25) and Mst. FAZEELAT 
JAN and others versus SIKANDAR through his Legal Heirs and 
others (PLD 2003 Supreme Court 475). 
5.  
It would not be out of place to mention here that “respondent” 
though arranged her representation through Mr. Muhammad Naseer 
Awan, Advocate but he did not turn up without any justifiable reason 
so I have no other option except to proceed in his absence. 
6.  
Heard. Record perused. 
7.  
In the light of respective contentions, noted hereinabove, the 
matter in issue is now only confined and restricted to the scope and 
import of reconciliation proceedings as embodied in Section 10 of 
the “Act, 1964” as the petitioner is challenging the vires of impugned 
order on the ground that the Family Court has failed to conduct 
reconciliation proceedings in a concrete and effective manner before 
dissolving the marriage. 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024.

8.  
The spouses are admittedly Muslims hence they are to be 
governed by the Quranic injunctions. To this effect Surah 2 
Al-Baqarah, Ayat 229 is very pertinent for the resolution of matter in 
issue, which commends as under:- 
  خُ ذُ وا۟ مِ مَّ ا

Divorce is twice. Then [after that], either keep [her] in an acceptable manner 
or release [her] with good treatment. And it is not lawful for you to take 
anything of what you have given them unless both fear that they will not be 
able to keep [within] the limits of Allāh.1 But if you fear that they will not keep 
[within] the limits of Allāh, then there is no blame upon either of them 
concerning that by which she ransoms herself. These are the limits of Allāh, 
so do not transgress them. And whoever transgresses the limits of Allāh - it is 
those who are the wrongdoers [i.e., the unjust]. 
9.  
After going through the Islamic injunctions it can be observed 
with all clarity that Islam permits dissolution of marriage between 
Muslim spouses in three ways i.e. Talaq, Mubarat and khula. 
Needless to reiterate that Talaq is an arbitrary and unilateral act of 
the husband, whereby, he may divorce his wife. Mubarat on the other 
hand is one of the forms of dissolution of marriage whereunder 
spouses may agree to part their ways through mutual consent. 
Contrary to both, a Muslim woman is also vested a right to obtain 
divorce through the court of law by instituting a suit, which is termed 
as “khula”.  
10.  
“Khula” denotes the right of a Muslim woman to seek 
dissolution of her marriage in which she gives or consents to give a 
consideration to the husband for her release from marriage as 
determined by the court. In addition, Section 2 of The Dissolution of 
Muslim Marriages Act, 1939 (hereinafter referred to as “Act, 1939) 
lays down the grounds on which a Muslim woman can seek a decree 
for dissolution of marriage. For ready reference and convenience, 
same is reproduced below:- 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-6- 
 
“2. Grounds for decree for dissolution of marriage.- A 
woman married under Muslim Law shall be entitled to obtain 
a decree for the dissolution of her marriage on any one or 
more of the following grounds, namely:- 
(i) 
that the whereabouts of the husband have not been 
known for a period of four years;  
 
(ii) 
that the husband has neglected or has failed to 
provide for her maintenance for a period of two years;  
 
[(iia) 
that the husband has taken an additional wife in 
contravention of the provisions of the Muslim Family 
Laws Ordinance, 1961] 
(iii) 
that the husband has been sentenced to 
imprisonment for a period of seven years or upwards; 
 
(iv) 
that the husband has failed to perform, without 
reasonable cause, his marital obligations for a period

(v) 
that the husband was impotent at the time of the 
marriage and continues to be so;  
 
(vi) 
that the husband has been insane for a period of two 
years or is suffering from leprosy or a virulent 
venereal disease;  
 
(vii) 
that she, having been given in marriage by her father 
or other guardian before she attained the age of 
[sixteen] years, repudiated the marriage before 
attaining the age of eighteen years:  
 
Provided that the marriage has not been consummated;  
[(viia) lian, 
Explanation.- Lian means where the husband has accused 
his wife of zina and the wife does not accept the accusation 
as true.] 
(viii) 
that the husband treats her with cruelty, that is to say, 
 
(a)  habitually assaults her or makes her life    
miserable by cruelty of conduct even if such 
conduct does not amount to physical 
ill-treatment, or  
 
(b)    associate with women of evil repute or leads an 
infamous life, or  
 
(c)  attempts to force her to lead an immoral life, or 
 
(d)  disposes of her property or prevents her 
exercising her legal rights over it, or  
 
(e)     obstructs her in the observance of her religious 
profession or practice, or  
 
(f)     if he has more wives than one, does not treat 
her equitably in accordance with the injunctions 
of the Quran,  

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-7- 
 
 
(ix)  on any other ground which is recognized as valid for 
the dissolution of marriages under Muslim Law: 
Provided that –  
 
(a) 
no decree shall be passed on ground (iii) until 
the sentence has become final;  
(b) 
a decree passed on ground (i) shall not take 
effect for a period of six months from the date 
of such decree, and if the husband appears 
either in person or through an authorised agent 
within that period and satisfies the Court that 
he is prepared to perform his conjugal duties, 
the Court shall set aside the said decree; and  
 
(c) 
before passing a decree on ground (v) the 
Court shall, on application by the husband, 
make an order requiring the husband to satisfy 
the Court within a period of one year from the 
date of such order that he has ceased to be 
impotent, and if the husband so satisfied the 
Court within such period, no decree shall be 
passed on the said ground.” 
11.  
There is, however, a mark distinction between dissolution of 
marriage through “khula” under the “Act, 1964” and “Act, 1939”. 
To understand such distinction in better terms one cannot lost sight 
of recent judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of 
Ibrahim Khan versus Mst. Saima Khan and others (Civil Petitions 
No.4657 to 4659 of 2022). Relevant extract from the same is 
reproduced below:- 
“11. Where a woman files suit for dissolution of marriage 
under the grounds of DMMA or through khula, there are 
procedural distinctions. Firstly, under Section 2 of the DMMA, 
various grounds (cruelty, assault, ill-treatment, etc.) are 
provided for judicial pronouncement of dissolving the marital 
relationship, which is also called fuskh. Hence, there must be 
some cause as per the DMMA to get a decree of dissolution 
of marriage under the DMMA. However, khula can be granted 
to a woman without establishing any ground or proving the 
cause to the court. Secondly, if the grounds under the DMMA 
are established by a woman, then Section 5 of the said law 
protects her right of dower as the same shall not be affected. 
Whereas in khula, she has to waive or forgo her right of dower. 
Lastly, in terms of procedure in the case of khula, once the 
pre-trial reconciliation fails under Section 10 of the Family 
Courts Act, 1964 (FCA), the court is bound to immediately 
pass a decree for the dissolution of marriage. Whereas the 
decree for dissolution of marriage under the DMMA can only 
be passed after the recording of evidence under Section 11 of 
the FCA. Therefore, termination of marriage under the DMMA 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-8- 
 
or by way of khula exists in, distinct and different legal 
domains with separate consequences.”  
After having an overview of above principles, no cavil left to hold 
that “khula” and dissolution of marriage under the “Act, 1939” 
operate under entirely different legal systems, leading to distinct 
outcomes as well. 
12.  
Since the petition at hand stems from an order of the Family 
Court awarding a decree for dissolution of marriage on the basis of 
“khula” in lieu of return of dower of Rs.50,000/- so it would be apt 
to restrict ourselves to the core issue relating to the true import of 
Section 10 of the “Act, 1964”. For the purpose of ease of reference, 
it is reproduced hereinbelow:-   
“S.10. Pre-trial proceeding.-(1) When the written statement 
is filed, the Court shall fix an early date for a pre-trial hearing 
of the case. 
(2)  
On the date so fixed, the Court shall examine the 
plaint, the written statement (if any) and the precise of 
evidence and documents filed by the parties and shall also, if 
it so deems fit, hear the parties, and their counsel. 
(3)  
The Family Court may, at the pre-trial stage, ascertain 
the precise points of controversy between the parties and 
attempt to effect compromise between the parties. 
(4)  
Subject to subsection (5), if compromise is not 
possible between the parties, the Family Court may, if 
necessary, frame precise points of controversy and record 
evidence of the parties. 
(5)  
In a suit for dissolution of marriage, if reconciliation 
fails, the Family Court shall immediately pass a decree for 
dissolution of marriage and, in case of dissolution of marriage 
through khula, may direct the wife to surrender up to fifty 
percent of her deferred dower or up to twenty-five percent of 
her admitted prompt dower to the husband. 
(6) 
Subject to subsection (5), in the decree for dissolution 
of marriage, the Family Court shall direct the husband to pay 
whole or part of the outstanding deferred dower to the wife.” 
(Underlining is supplied for emphasis) 
 
From the bare glimpse of above referred provision of law, it clearly 
manifests that Subsection (3) makes it imperative for the Family 
Court to ascertain the precise points of controversy between the 
parties and attempt to effect compromise between them at the 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-9- 
 
pre-trial stage. Subsection (5), however, postulates that in a suit for 
dissolution of marriage, if reconciliation fails, the Family Court shall 
immediately pass a decree for dissolution of marriage and in case of 
dissolution of marriage through “khula”, it may direct the wife to 
surrender upto fifty percent of her deferred dower or upto twenty five 
percent of her admitted prompt dower to the husband. 
13.  
The survey of law and the precedents referred by the learned 
Advocate General, Punjab paves a path to discover the legislative 
history of right of “khula”. Right of “khula” of wife was identified 
for the first time in the jurisprudence of Pakistan in the case of Mst. 
BALQIS FATIMA versus NAJM-UL-IKRAM QURESHI (PLD 1959 
(W.P.) Lahore 566). The relevant extract from the judgment is 
reproduced below:- 
“3. In the appeal in the suit for dissolution of marriage, we find no 
reason to differ with the finding of the learned District Judge that the 
husband was in no way to blame for the rukhsati not taking place, 
and, therefore, the wife was not entitled to maintenance. This finding 
would have finished the appeal, but learned counsel for the 
appellant wife raised a new point that a khula is the right of wife, 
that is, the wife can at any time come to Court and demand a divorce 
on abandonment and restitution of any benefit which she may have 
received from her husband. As the point was one of pure law, we 
allowed it to be argued. In support of his argument, learned counsel 
for the wife placed reliance on what is contained in a book entitled " 
Haquq-uz-Zaujain " written by Maulana Abul Ala Maudoodi. In this 
book, Maulana Maudoodi has dealt exhaustively with the nature and 
incidents of khula and has recorded an emphatic opinion that khula 
is the right of the wife. He reproduces first the verse of the Holy 
Quran which says: " And if you fear that they (spouses) cannot be 
kept within the limits of Allah there is no blame on them or what she 
may give up to become free thereby." Maulana Maudoodi interprets 
these words as meaning that the wife will be entitled on payment to 
secure her release. He then supports his inference by reference to 
how the Holy Prophet acted in the well known cases of Sabit Bin 
Kais wherein the Holy Prophet had ordered Kais to divorce his wives 
on their restoration of what they had received from him. The 
commentator also quotes an instance from Hazrat Umar wherein he 
had allowed divorce to a woman on payment of some small amount 
because the woman had absolutely refused to live with her 
husband. 
4. Maulana Maudoodi is not only a great religious scholar but comes 
from the orthodox school, and his opinion, by itself, could be the 
basis of a further investigation with respect to the rights of a woman 
for divorce. But there is some other authority too which supports 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-10- 
 
him. According to the opinion of Maulana Muhammad Ali expressed 
in "The Religion of Islam " at page 673, there is an equality between 
the spouses with respect to divorce. After quoting the following 
verse of Holy Quran, " And if you fear a breach (shiqaq) between 
the two, then appoint a judge from his people and a judge from her 
people ; if they both desire agreement, Allah will effect harmony 
between them, surely Allah is Knowing, Aware", and then referring 
to the following words, "And if they separate, Allah will render them 
both free from want out of His ampleness, and Allah is Ample-giving, 
Wise ", the learned commentator says: 
" This verse gives us not only the principle of divorce, which is 
shiqaq or a disagreement to live together as husband and wife, 
but also the process to be adopted when a rupture of marital 
relations is feared. The two sexes are here placed on a level of 
perfect equality. A breach between the two ' would imply that 
either the husband or the wife' wants to break off the marriage 
agreement and hence either may claim a divorce when the 
parties can no longer pull on in agreement. In the process to be 
adopted, both husband and wife are to be represented on a 
status of equality ; a judge has to be appointed from his people 
and another from her people. The two are told to try to remove 
the differences and reconcile the parties to each other. If 
agreement cannot be brought about, a divorce will follow." 
 In the beginning of the Chapter of Khula and Mubarat, Mr. Amir Ali 
says: 
" Previous to the Islamic legislation, the wives had no right to 
claim a dissolution of the marriage on any ground whatsoever. 
In special cases only the power of divorce was expressly 
reserved in their favour by contract. As a general rule, neither 
the Hebrews nor the pre-Islamic Arabs recognised the right of 
divorce for women. The Koran allowed them this privilege which 
had been denied to them by the primitive institutions of their 
country." 
This paragraph would seem to lay down that the wife has a right of 
divorce, though it is true that it is not explained further in this chapter 
as to how this right is to be exercised. At page 519 of the same 
book, it is stated that so far as Shias are concerned, in case of 
shiqaq, arbitrator may be appointed to settle their disputes and if no 
settlement can be effected, the marriage ought to be dissolved. In 
Islamic Law by Aziz Ahmad, the Malki Law relating to khula is thus 
explained: 
 In Bibi Sogra v. Muhammad Sayeed (40 I C 672), Roe, J. had 
expressed the opinion, after reference to Muhammadan Law by Mr. 
Amir Ali, that if the wife wants to obtain a divorce without any 
justifiable cause, she has simply to abandon her claim to the 
settlement in order to secure a dissolution of her marriage.” 
4. The question is obviously an important one. We accordingly refer 
the following question to a Full Bench :- 
Whether under the Muslim Law the wife is entitled to khula as of 
right ? 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-11- 
 
As we are making a reference in the appeal arising out of the 
dissolution of marriage, the Letters Patent Appeal in the suit for 
restitution of conjugal rights will have to remain pending till this 
appeal is decided. 
OPINION OF FULL BENCH 
KAIKAUS, J.---Briefly the facts leading to this reference are that the 
simple nikah ceremony of the appellant, Mst. Balqis Fatima, and the 
respondent, Mr. Najm-ul-Ikram, took place in Lahore on the 7th of 
October 1949. Before rukhsati could take place, disputes arose 
between the families of the parties so that the spouses never lived 
together. On the 2nd of January 1952 i.e., about two, years and 
three months after the nikah ceremony, the appellant filed the suit, 
out of which Regular Second Appeal No. 39 of 1957 arises, claiming 
dissolution of marriage, on the two following grounds :- 
(1) That the husband had failed to provide maintenance for a period 
of more than two years ; 
(2) that the husband was associating with women of evil repute. 
While this suit was pending, the husband too filed a suit for 
restitution of conjugal rights. The two suits were consolidated. The 
trial Court found that the husband had failed to provide maintenance 
to the wife for a period of more than two years, and decreed the suit 
for dissolution of marriage. The suit for restitution of conjugal rights 
was dismissed because of the decree for dissolution. On appeal by 
the present respondent, the learned District Judge found that the 
wife was not entitled to maintenance because it was she and not 
the husband who was responsible for rukhsati not taking place. As 
this was the only ground on which the suit for dissolution had been 
decreed, the learned District Judge accepted the appeal and 
dismissed that suit. However, he was of the opinion that the 
relations between the parties had become so strained that it would 
not be proper to pass a decree in favour of the husband for 
restitution of conjugal rights. He, therefore, dismissed the other suit 
also. 
2. The wife filed an appeal against the dismissal of her suit for 
dissolution of marriage, while the husband preferred an appeal in 
the suit for restitution of conjugal rights. The appeal of the husband 
was dismissed in limine by Yaqub Ali, J. and the husband has filed 
L. P. A. No. 26 of 1957 against that judgment. The second appeal 
of the wife (Regular Second Appeal No. 39 of 1957) and the Letters 
Patent Appeal of the husband both came up for hearing before me 
and Shabir Ahmad, J. In the Regular Second Appeal we found no 
reason to disagree with the learned District Judge on the question 
as to who was to blame for the rukhsti not having taken place and 
we were of the opinion that the wife was not, under the 
circumstances, entitled to maintenance. This finding would have 
been sufficient for the disposal of the, appeal, but a new point was 
raised before us. It was contended that khula is the right of the wife, 
i.e., the wife can at any time come to Court and demand the grant 
of divorce on restitution of any benefit which she may have received 
from the husband. This was a pure question of law which, if 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-12- 
 
conceded, would entitle the wife to a decree though the decree 
could be made only after she returned the benefit that she had 
received. Keeping particularly in view the fact that the learned 
District Judge had found the relations of the parties to be so strained 
as to stand in the way of a decree in the suit for restitution of 
conjugal rights, we allowed the point to be argued. Finding that there 
was some force in the contention-of learned counsel for the 
appellant, we decided to make a reference of the point raised to a 
Full Bench, in view of its great general importance. Following is the 
question which has been referred :- 
"Whether under Muslim Law the wife is entitled to khula as of 
right ?" 
We find that in some authorities the word `khula' has been defined 
as an agreement between the husband and wife, and we want to 
make it clear that the question referred means no more than the 
following question :- 
"Is the wife entitled to dissolution of marriage on restoration of 
what she has received from the husband in consideration of 
marriage ?" 
The two questions have for us an identical import for we are not 
using the word `khula' in the sense of an agreement but in the sense 
of a dissolution on restoration of benefit received. 
3. The verse of the Qur'an which is the basis of the right of 
khula is Verse No. 229 of Sura Baqr, which runs-Divorce may 
be (pronounced) twice ; then keep (them) in good fellowship 
or let (them) go with kindness, and it is not lawful for you to 
take any part or what you have given them, unless both fear 
that they cannot keep within the limits of Allah ; then if you fear 
that they cannot keep within limits of Allah, there is no blame 
on them for what she gives up to become free thereby. These 
are the limits of Allah, so do not exceed them, and whoever 
exceeds the limits of Allah, these it is that are the unjust." 
4. This verse admittedly permits the termination of a marriage by 
the wife passing consideration to the husband. The question for 
consideration is whether this termination can be effected only by 
agreement between the husband and the wife or F whether the wife 
can claim such termination even if the husband be not agreeable. 
The first point that deserves attention is that the words "if you fear" 
are addressed to the "ulil amr" that is, the State, or the Judge. On 
this point there is no difference at all between the commentators 
and there could be no difference for the spouses are being referred 
to as `they' in this part of the verse. The words `if you fear' show 
that the judge is to determine if the circumstances are such that 
there is apprehension of the spouses not observing the limits of 
God. Now, what for is he to determine this question if after he has 
determined it, his finding is to have no effect on the matter ? It is not 
the view of any of the schools of Muslim Law that if the spouses 
agree to a separation still a finding by the Judge that there is 
apprehension of transgression of limits of God is essential. All jurists 
accept that if parties agree, no such finding is needed. If without 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-13- 
 
agreement there could be no termination of marriage and if in case 
of agreement nothing further was needed, the determination by the 
Judge would become meaningless. The reference to the Judge can 
only mean that he is entitled to pass an order even though the 
husband does not agree. The interpretation is supported by the two 
oft-quoted instances of khula ordered by the Holy Prophet. Both 
relate to Sabit Ibn-i-Qais. In the first incident, his wife Jamila came 
to the Prophet and stated her complaint in the following words :- 
"Oh Prophet of God. Nothing can bring me and him together. 
When I raised my veil, he was coming from the front with some 
men. I saw that he was out of them the shortest and the ugliest. 
I swear by God I do not hate him because of any defect in him, 
religious or moral, but I hate his ugliness. I swear by God that if 
it was not for fear of God I would have spit at his face when he 
came to me. Oh Prophet of God, you see how handsome I am, 
and Sabit is an ugly person. I don't blame his religion or his 
morals but I fear heresy in Islam." 
On hearing this the Prophet of God said to Jamila :- 
"Are you prepared to return the garden that he gave you". She 
said : "Yes, Oh Prophet of God, and even more". The Holy 
Prophet said : "No more, but you return the garden that he 
gave you", and then the Holy Prophet said to Sabit : "Take the 
garden and divorce her". 
5. The second incident is of Habiba, the other wife of Sabit, and it is 
thus stated by Imam Malik and Abu Daud. "One day early in the 
morning when the Holy Prophet came out of his house, he found 
Habiba standing there. He inquired from her what the matter was 
and she said. "I and Sabit can never pull on together", When Sabit 
appeared, the Prophet of God said : `This is Habiba, daughter of 
Sehl. She has stated what God wished she should state'. Habiba 
said, "O, Prophet of God, let Sabit take from me whatever he has 
given me for that is all with me". The Holy Prophet told Sabit to take 
back what he had given her and to release her". In some versions 
the words used are "khale sabilaha" and in others "fariqha". Both of 
them mean "divorce her". 
6. I may state here that there is a version of this tradition reported 
by Abu Daood and Ibn Garir as coming from Hazrat Aisha wherein 
it is stated that Sabit had beaten Habiba so as to break her bone, 
but as pointed out by Maulana Maudoodi (page 68 of 
Haquq-uz-Zaujain) it appears from the words imputed to Habiba by 
Ibn Maja that the complaint of Habiba was not of beating but of 
ugliness. She had used the same words as Jamila, that is, "if I did 
not fear God, I would spit at his face". It should also be noted that 
the Holy Prophet had ordered restitution of property by Habiba 
which indicates that the dissolution was not for fault of the husband. 
If the divorce was due to cruelty, there is no reason why the dower 
should have been returned. 
7. This is how the Holy Prophet enforced the right of khula. In both 
these cases there was an order by him to Sabit to take back what 
he had given to the wife and to divorce her. In neither case was 
Sabit in any way to blame, and so far as Jamila is concerned, she 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-14- 
 
had expressly said that she found no fault with him and that the sole 
reason why she wanted a release was that he was ugly and she 
could not bear him, she being herself a handsome woman. In 
neither case did the Holy Prophet make any pronouncement as to 
the reasonableness of the attitude of the wife. He was just satisfied 
that the husband and wife could not amicably live together. He 
never asked for the consent of the husband. 
8. The same appears to be the practice of the Khulafa-I-Rashidin. 
Before Hazrat Umar appeared a woman and her husband. The 
woman wanted a divorce. Hazrat Umar advised her to live with her 
husband, but she refused. At this Hazrat Umar shut her up in a 
dungeon which was full of refuse. After keeping her there for three 
days, he asked her how she had fared. She replied: "I swear by 
God, I have never passed more peaceful nights". At this Hazrat 
Umar said to the husband. 
"Give her khula even if it be in lieu of her earrings". (Kushf-ul-
Ghumma). It will be observed that there was no inquiry into the 
grounds of the wife's refusal to live with the husband. Only 
Hazrat Umar was convinced that the wife was serious in her 
demand and was really unhappy with her husband what-ever the 
reason. No fault had been found with the husband. 
9. Rabi, daughter of Maooz, approached Hazrat Usman for a khula 
in lieu of all that she owned. Hazrat Usman ordered her husband to 
take all that she had and to grant her a divorce. 
10. Maulana Abul-ala-Maudoodi, whose position as a distinguished 
religious scholar is not open to any doubt, has in his book entitled 
"Haqooq-uz-Zaujain" dealt exhaustively with the question of the 
right of the wife to a khula and has recorded an emphatic and fully 
reasoned opinion that the wife can claim khula as of right, subject 
only to the existence of an apprehension that the spouses will 
transgress the limits of God. He says (page 61) "Muslim Law just as 
it has given to the husband the right to divorce the wife with whom 
he cannot pull on has also given to the wife the right to get a khula 
from her husband whom she hates and with whom she cannot live". 
After explaining that there is a moral and legal side to the exercise 
of the right of khula and that morally it is wrong for the husband as 
well as the wife to exercise the right of divorce or khula just in order 
to satisfy their animal passions elsewhere, he continues: "But law 
which fixes the rights of persons ignores this aspect. Just as it gives 
the right of divorce to the husband, it gives the wife the right of khula 
so that in case of need there may be a liberty to each to get a 
release from the bondage of marriage and neither party be forced 
to continue in marriage where there is hatred in the heart, objects 
of marriage are being frustrated and married life has become a 
torture." As regards the abuse of power thus granted to the 
spouses, the law places all reasonable restrictions on the exercise 
of their power, but then to a great extent leaves the matter to the 
good sense of the party, and really none but the party or the 
Almighty can determine whether the need of the party is real or 
whether he or she is only a seeker after sexual enjoyment."

11. The importance of the opinion of Maulana Maudoodi is 
enhanced by the fact that he belongs to the orthodox school. He is 
not a person against whom a charge of heresy or schism can be 
brought. 
12. Maulvi Muhammad Ali, another great religious scholar, the 
author of commentary on the Qur'an and of numerous religious 
books has in his "Religion of Islam" expressed a similar opinion. He 
says (page 676)- 
" The right of the wife to claim a divorce is, not only recognized 
by the Holy Qur'an and Hadith but also in Fiqh. The technical 
term for the wife's right to divorce by returning her dowry is called 
khul, and it is based on the Hadith already quoted, and ti-a 
following verse of the Holy Qur'an. `Divorce may be pronounced 
twice ; then keep them in good fellowship or let them go with 
kindness ; and it is not lawful for you to take any part of what you 
have given them unless both fear that they cannot keep within 
the limits of Allah, then if you fear that they cannot keep within 
the limits of Allah there is no blame on them for what she gives 
up to become free thereby' (2 : 229). By keeping `within the limits 
of Allah' here is clearly meant the fulfilment of the object of 
marriage or performance of the duties imposed by conjugal 
relationship. The dowry is thus a check on the party who wants 
the divorce ; if the husband wants to divorce the wife, the wife 
shall have the dowry ; if the wife wants the divorce, the husband 
is entitled to the dowry. But it is the judges spoken of in v. 4 : 35, 
and referred to here in the words `if you fear that they cannot 
keep within the limits of Allah,' that shall decide whether the 
husband or the wife is responsible for the breach and which of 
them is entitled to the dowry." 
The word "dowry" is being used here in the same sense as the 
dower. 
13. In 1956 a Commission was appointed by the Government of 
Pakistan to report on marriage laws. The Chairman of the 
Commission was Mian Sir Abdul Rashid, a retired Chief Justice of 
Pakistan. The report of the Commission is printed at page 1215 of 
the Central Gazette. With respect to the right of khula the report 
said: 
"The Commission is of the opinion that the provisions of the 
Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939, do not require any 
modification. It. was also agreed that supplementary legislation 
may be undertaken to make the khula form of talaq more certain 
and precise. About khula, that is divorce sought by wife, there is 
a consensus of opinion that Islam has granted this right to the 
woman if she foregoes the mehr or a part of it, if it is so 
demanded by the husband. There is a universally accepted 
Hadith about a khula case which arose between a woman of the 
name of Jamila and her husband Sabit-ibn-Qais. The Holy 
Prophet granted the divorce on the basis of extreme 
incompatibility of temperament only ; no other accusation was 
made by the wife as a ground for the demand of divorce. We are 
recommending that incompatibility of temperament should not 
give the wife a right to demand a divorce except in the khula 
form." 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-16- 
 
14. In Aziz Ahmad's Muslim Law (page 235) the view of the Ahmadi 
(Qadiani) sect of Muslims is thus stated :- 
"Ahmadiyya View.-The Court has the power and must grant 
khula if it is so moved by the wife. It is maintained that 
incompatibility of temperament or hatred is a good ground for 
khula and the assertion of the wife that she hates her husband 
or that their temperaments differ must be accepted, provided 
that the Court may delay the decision for a reasonable time to 
assure itself that the wife is not acting under a temporary 
passion or under the influence of a third person. To be sure 
on the point, the Court may order her to give her husband an 
opportunity to see her and plead with her. If the wife refuses 
to obey the order of the Court, the decision may be postponed 
till she obeys it." 
15. Amir Ali, the author of a well-known commentary on Muslim Law 
begins his chapter of khula and mubarat with the following words :- 
"Previous to the Islamic legislation, the wives had no right to 
claim a dissolution of the marriage on any ground whatsoever. 
In special cases only the power of divorce was expressly 
reserved in their favour by contract. As a general rule, neither 
the Hebrews nor the pre-Islamic Arabs recognised the right of 
divorce for women. The Koran allowed them this privilege which 
had been denied to them by the primitive institutions of their 
country. 
`When married parties disagree', says the Fatawai Alamgiri 
following the Hedaya and the Badaya, `and are apprehensive 
that they 'cannot observe the bounds prescribed by the divine 
laws, that is, cannot perform the duties imposed on them by the 
conjugal relationship, the woman can release herself from the tie 
by giving up some property in return in consideration of which 
the husband is to give her a khula and when they have done this 
a talak-ul-gain would take place. 
This quotation gives the impression that the learned commentator 
regarded the passage in Fatawa-i-Alamgiri and the verse of the 
Qur'an on which the passage is based as recognising the right of 
the wife to secure a release, otherwise the words "Qur'an allowed 
them this privilege" would be inappropriate. Sir Rowland Wilson 
does not regard-this interpretation of the passage in Fatawa as 
impossible. He says (page 154 of Anglo-Muhammadan Law)- 
"As to judicial divorce for the husband's cruelty or adultery, the 
Hedaya and Fatawa-i-Alamgiri are silent, unless, indeed, we are 
to understand in a compulsory sense an isolated expression in 
an extract from the latter work, which is thus rendered by Baillie, 
page 304 : `When married parties disagree, and are 
apprehensive that they cannot observe the bounds prescribed 
by Almighty God (or, in other words, perform the duties 
incumbent on them by the marriage relation), there is no 
objection to the woman's ransoming herself from her husband, 
with property, in consideration of which he is to give her a 
khoola". If this means that the kazi must, or may, on the wife's 
demand, compel the husband to give her a khula, we must 
further suppose (1) that he can pass such a decree on mere 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-17- 
 
proof of incurable disagreement, or incompatibility, irrespective 
of actual cruelty or other breach of conjugal duty ; and (2) that 
he can fix at his discretion the price at which the woman is to 
purchase her freedom. These propositions, if accepted; would to 
a certain degree assimilate the woman's position as regards 
divorce to that of the man, but the point has never come up for 
judicial decision in that form in British India. In Khalilal Rehman, 
(Burma, 1820), 49 I C 804, the grounds for a judicial divorce are 
stated in wide terms, including habitual cruelty, and perhaps 
even desertion and neglect." 
And he adds his own opinion: 
"The Hadith in Tirmizi (1,368) that a woman who demands khula 
without necessity will loss heaven, implies that legally she can 
make good her demand, possibly without other reason than 
alleged `aversion' or in modern equivalent `incompatibility', but 
at least when she can satisfactorily show to impartial parties the 
impossibility of a happy married state." 
16. Before proceeding further it will be proper also to reproduce the 
allied verse of the Qur'an which relates not to khula but to 
disagreement between the spouses and provides for the action that 
should be taken in cases of such disagreement. The two matters 
are connected for if the Qur'an does not envisage the continuance 
of a married life in case of a breach and provides for dissolution in 
such a case even without restoration of benefit, the claim of the wife 
to a khula as of right becomes stronger. That verse is No. 35, part 
4, Chapter IV, and runs as follows :- 
"And if you fear a breach between the two, then appoint a judge 
(arbiter) from his people and a judge from her people; if they both 
desire agreement, Allah will effect harmony between them; 
surely Allah is Knowing, Aware." 
This provision enables the judge to appoint arbiters in a case when 
there is a breach between the parties, one from the family of the 
wife and the other from the family of the husband, and the arbiters 
are first to make an effort at reconciliation. If they are unable to 
effect a reconciliation but are of the opinion that the parties should 
be separated, they are to be separated, although there is a 
difference of opinion as to whether the arbiters themselves have the 
right to order separation or whether that is only the jurisdiction of the 
judge. In Umedatul Qari, the legal position is thus stated- 
"One of the arbiters should be from the side of the man and the 
other from the side of the woman, but if such people who will 
bring about settlement cannot be got from the friends of the 
parties, then it is permissible to appoint strangers. Verily if they 
(arbiters). differ, their order will not be promulgated but if they 
agree, it (their order) will be enforced in its entirety without any 
delegation. 
"But there is a difference of opinion as to what is to happen if the 
judges (arbiters) agree on separating the parties. It is the opinion 
of (Imam) Malik, (Imam) Auzai and (Imam) Ishaq that it will be 
enforced independently of any authority and without the 
permission of the spouses. But the Kufies and (Imam) Shafei 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-18- 
 
and (Imam Ahmad Ibne-i-Hanif are of opinion that they (arbiters) 
need permission because the right to divorce is with the husband 
; if he agrees in this (divorce) well and good but if he does not 
(agree to divorce) then the judge will effect a divorce. Ibne-i-Abi 
Sheba narrates of Hazrat Ali that he (Ali) said that Allah has 
permitted the arbiters to join the spouses and to separate them. 
Shabi is of opinion that whatever the arbiters decide will be 
enforced. Abu Salma is of opinion that if the arbiters wish they 
may bring the spouses together and if they wish they may 
separate. Mujahid is of the same opinion." 
17. It will be observed that although there is difference of opinion as 
to whether the arbiters themselves are capable of effecting a 
separation, there is no difference of opinion as to whether the Court 
can do so. The jurisdiction of the Qazi to effect a separation 
depends only on whether there is "shiqaq" between the parties, 
which means a breach. If the breach is established, he has authority 
to effect a separation though he will first appoint arbiters who will 
make an effort at reconciliation and if they come to the conclusion 
that the parties are not capable of living together as husband and 
wife in a manner that is in accord with the Muslim conception of 
married life, they would order a separation. 
18. That in the case of "shiqaq" there is jurisdiction in the Qazi to 
order a separation does not appear to be a matter of contest and is 
supported even by a careful study of the judgments which are cited 
against the right of the wife to a divorce, that is, Umar Bibi v. 
Mohammad Din and Saeeda Khanam v. Muhammad Sami. Later in 
this judgment, there is a full discussion of both these cases, but I 
may refer even at this stage to an objection raised by one of the 
Judges in the second-mentioned case. It will be observed that the 
word used in this verse is "hakam" which is translated in some 
commentaries as "judge" and in others as "arbiter". One of the 
learned Judges had interpreted this as referring only to a conciliator. 
Whichever of these two meanings is adopted any contention that 
this verse only provides for reconciliation has, with all respect, to be 
rejected. A person called judge or arbiter cannot be only a 
conciliator. He must have a power of decision. The only reasonable 
inference from the use of this word is that the hakam has power to 
separate the spouses. Whether the order is by itself capable of 
enforcement as is stated by some jurists or whether there is to be 
superadded to it the order of the judge as is stated by others, is 
really a matter of procedure. The question is whether it is the 
husband or the authority appointed by the State that is to determine 
whether the relationship is to continue, and the answer must be that 
it is the authority appointed by the State and the matter does not 
depend on the will of the husband. The answer must further be that 
the discretion of that authority is not hedged in by any rules. If it 
considers further continuance of marriage not proper, it puts an end 
to the marriage. As will appear from the quotation from Umdetul 
Qari, the view that hakam is to decide whether the relationship 
should continue has the support of as great a person as Hazrat Ali. 
19. Amir Ali (Muhammadan Law, volume II, page 519, 1929 edition) 
says that the jurisdiction of the Qazi to grant a divorce is "founded 
on the express words of the Prophet : `If a woman be prejudiced by 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-19- 
 
a marriage, let it be broken off.' The Shiah Bihar-Anwar also lays 
down that in case of nushuz or sheqaq arbitrators may be appointed 
to settle the disputes, or the Judge may intervene ; and "if no 
settlement can be effected, the marriage ought to be dissolved". 
20. The question which we have to decide in this reference is really 
a part of the broader question as to the attitude of Islam towards a 
discord between the husband and the wife. If a husband and the 
wife cannot live together in peace and harmony, does Islam allow 
them to separate or does it force them to continue? In this 
connection let us first refer to those verses of the Qur'an which give 
the Qur'anic concept of married life. "It is one of His signs that He 
created from -amongst yon your mates that you may find solace in 
their company and created between you love and kindness". 
(Arroom 3.1) "It is He who created you from a single person and 
made your mate of like nature that you find solace in her." (Araf 24) 
"You are apparel for them and they are apparel for you." (Baqar 23). 
Little doubt is left in one's mind as to the answer to the broader 
question on a consideration of the verses relating to Shiqaq and 
Khula along with these verses. Maulana Abul Kalam Azad while 
dealing with the interpretation of the verse relating to shiqaq thus 
answers this question. (Tarjman-ul-Qur'an, page 284) :- 
"It is not contemplated by a marriage that the parties should be 
tied together in all circumstances, nor that the wife should be just 
a means of satisfaction of the passions of the husband. 
The object of the marriage is the creation of a perfect and happy 
life by the conduct of the spouses and such a life can only be 
created if there be mutual love and affection and if the limits 
imposed by God be observed. If for some reason this is not 
possible, the object of the marriage has been defeated and it is 
necessary that the door be opened to the parties for a change. 
If on the object of the marriage being defeated, separation has 
not been allowed to the parties, this would have been a cruel 
limitation of the right of free choice and society would have been 
deprived of a happy married state of life." 
21. Law in the Middle East is a treatise on Muslim Law as 
administered in the Middle East, and is a collection of contribution 
made by a number of scholars of Muslim Law. It thus answers the 
question (pages 146/147) :- 
"It is decreed that the fundamental principle of the marriage 
contract is that it is permanent and is to endure as long as the 
spouses live. But in order for it to continue it is not alone 
sufficient for the shari'a to lay down the law that it is permanent; 
the love which binds the two spouses together must continue 
also, for it is the tie on which the continuation of true married life 
depends. But the spouses might develop a strong aversion to 
each other, thus making love difficult. In such a case one of three 
choices must be made : (1) To continue the marriage despite 
this strong aversion, thus giving rise to ill-will and rancour. The 
continuation of this situation would not be to the interest of the 
family ; (2) Physical separation while preserving the married 
state. This would be an offence against morality and might drive 
the two parties to vice. (3) Divorce, which breaks the 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-20- 
 
marriage-bond and makes an act of ill-will out of what had 
originally been an act of blessing. This is the soundest way, even 
though it means the destruction of the family. 
"If, then there must be divorce when aversion is strong, in whose 
hands shall the decision regarding divorce lie ? Shall both 
parties decide it jointly, shall the law decide it, or shall one of the 
two parties decide it ? 
"There is no doubt but that if the tw9 parties agree on divorce it 
must be carried out. It is only necessary to see that this 
agreement has not taken place in a momentary fit of anger which 
might quickly pass away ; Islam has made provision for such an 
eventuality as we shall make clear. 
"There remain the other two cases, namely whether the Judge 
(cadi) is to determine when divorce can take place or whether 
this can be done by one of the two parties. 
"If the woman wants a divorce it can take place only by decision 
of the cadi because the husband has undertaken financial 
responsibilities with regard to this marriage ; he has made an 
advance payment on the bride-price and is to pay the balance 
upon divorce ; he has furnished the house and has incurred 
many expenses. If the wife could divorce him on her own 
responsibility he would lose all that he had spent on her. It is 
therefore necessary for the cadi to intervene in order to ascertain 
that she has requested a divorce because she has been 
wronged. If such is the case, then the husband bears the B 
consequences and loses the money which he has spent on her. 
If it is established that the aversion is on her part and that it is 
the cause of her seeking a divorce, then the cadi divorces them 
on condition that she reimburse the husband for all that he has 
spent on his marriage. This is the procedure of the school of 
Malik which was the practice also of some of the Companions of 
the Prophet and their successors. The intervention of the cadi 
was for the purpose of preventing the husband from being 
wronged if it were she who bore the aversion to him, so that the 
husband would not lose the money which he had spent on her." 
22. I may also refer here to the question as to whether there are any 
limitations on the power of the Qazi to dissolve a marriage. That the 
Qazi has authority to dissolve a marriage is universally accepted. 
But is this power of his subject to any limitations ? The Qazi 
dissolves a marriage if the husband is impotent or suffers from 
leprosy or insanity or if he has been absent for a long time or if he 
is unable to maintain the wife or to perform the marital obligations. 
Are these grounds enumerated in the Qur'an or the Hadith ? Let me 
state that neither the Qur'an nor the Hadith enumerates the ground 
on which dissolution can be brought. The Qazi has been dissolving 
marriages on the grounds aforesaid because he found that 
continuance of the marriage in the circumstances was not just and 
proper. The only limitation on the power of the Qazi to dissolve the 
marriage is his own conscience-his judgment that the marriage 
should not under the circumstances be continued. If the parties 
cannot live together as Islam intends they should live, they are to 
be separated. If the authority of the Qazi to dissolve a marriage were 
based on the verse relating to shiqaq, even in that case the only 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-21- 
 
limitation on his part would be that a breach should exist between 
the parties. However, his jurisdiction goes beyond that for he can 
dissolve a marriage on the ground of impotency, insanity or absence 
of husband, or option of puberty, none of which is a case of shiqaq. 
His jurisdiction is based on the simple fact that Islam regards the 
marriage contract as being capable of termination. It has to be 
terminable because it is not a reasonably possible view that a 
marriage must continue even though the husband misbehaves or is 
unable to perform his obligations or for no fault of the wife it would 
be cruel to continue it. 
23. To the husband the law grants full power of divorce. He can put 
an end to the marital tie at will whether he has a ground or not. It 
would be reprehensible that he should divorce one wife and take 
another just for sexual enjoyment, yet the law places no restrictions 
on his power of divorce and leaves the matter to his good sense. If 
such power be granted to the husband, why should there be a great 
disparity between the rights of the wife and the husband? One can 
understand that the husband having paid or taken on himself the 
responsibility of payment of dower, the wife should not be allowed 
to put an end to the contract so as to appropriate that which is paid 
or promised by the husband and she should be forced to restore the 
benefit she has taken. It is also argued sometimes that the female 
is fickle-minded and may on a passing fancy or a sudden impuse 
effect a separation. But assuming without conceding that in this 
respect the male is better than the female, the objection can be met 
with by giving the right to pronounce a divorce in a case where the 
wife wants it to the Qazi and not to the wife herself. The Qazi will in 
that case be able to see whether there is really any dispute between 
the parties and whether the wife is serious in her demand for 
dissolution. But it does not seem reasonable that while to one of the 
two contracting parties has been granted a plenary power to put an 
end to the contract, there should be no power given to the other 
party and the wife must in order to get a release prove some such 
misconduct on the part of the husband as will disentitle him to the 
continuance of the marriage. The wife ought, in reason, to have a 
right similar to that of the husband subject only to the order of the 
Court. She- should approach the Qazi who may advise her and 
make an effort to effect a reconciliation, but if she be adamant and 
the Qazi apprehends that the limits imposed by God will not be 
observed, she can only be ordered to restore all the benefits she 
has received. The rights of the contracting parties should as far as 
the circumstances permit beat a par. 
24. Let me review the argument in brief and state my conclusions. 
The only proper interpretation of the verse relating to khula is that 
khula depends on the order of the judge and not on the will of the 
husband. That is the implication of the words "if you fear" being, 
addressed to a judge, or the head of the State. The judge ought to 
grant khula if he finds that "they will not observe the limits of God". 
Contemporary opinion is unanimous on this interpretation. As 
regards the verse relating to shiqaq the clear implication of "arbiter" 
is that there is power to order separation and the verse does not 
contemplate an attempt at reconciliation alone. So far as the power 
of the Qazi is concerned, there does not appear-to be any dispute 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-22- 
 
that he will be able to separate the parties in case of shiqaq. This 
would appear from the quotation from the Umdatul Qari. Islam does 
not force on the spouses a life devoid of harmony and happiness 
and if the parties cannot live together as they should, it permits a 
separation. If the dissolution is due to some default on the part of 
the husband, there is no need of any restitution. If the husband is 
not in any way at fault, there has to be restoration of property 
received by the wife and ordinarily it will be of the whole of the 
property but the judge may take into consideration reciprocal 
benefits received by the husband and continuous living together 
also may be a benefit received. The jurisdiction of the Qazi to 
dissolve a marriage in cases of shiqaq is limited only by what is 
stated in the t Qur'an, i.e., "if you fear a breach" which means that 
there is real discord between the parties, and in the case of khula 
by the words "If you fear that they will not observe the limits of God". 
While effecting separation, the Qazi adjusts the financial matters so 
as to direct a partial or total restoration of the benefits received by 
the wife. 
25. It may be objected that we would be, granting to the wife for the 
first time a right of release from the marital tie and it may be asked 
whether it is open to us to adopt a course different from that laid 
down by the old jurists. There area number of replies to this 
objection. The first is that no Hanafi authority has been cited before 
us which may deal with the question as to whether the wife is 
entitled to a divorce on restoration of benefit, and it cannot be said 
that we are in direct conflict with any Hanafi authority. Parties are 
admittedly Hanafis. In fact before us no ancient jurist has been cited 
at all who may have discussed the question. The second reply is 
that there is admittedly jurisdiction in the Qazi in accordance with 
the verse relating to shiqaq to separate the spouses. As the 
quotation from Umedatul Qari shows there is no dispute as to the 
power of the Qazi to order a separation though there is dispute as 
to the power of the arbiters without the order of the Qazi. The only 
condition of this jurisdiction is the existence of discord. The 
difference between the jurisdiction granted by the verse relating to 
shiqaq and the jurisdiction granted by the verse relating to khula is 
that between circumstances that constitute shiqaq and 
circumstances that will raise an apprehension that the limits of God 
will not be observed. I do not think there is much difference between 
the two jurisdictions. If there is shiqaq, the parties will not be 
observing the limits of God and vice versa. The two verses should 
be read together and once we accept the jurisdiction of Qazi to order 
dissolution in case of shiqaq, there would be little difficulty in holding 
that the Qazi can order a khula. 
26. Even if it- were to be held that the passage reproduced from 
Umedatul Qari does not establish that all schools accept the 
jurisdiction of the. Qazi to dissolve marriage in case of shiqaq, it 
cannot be denied that Imam Malik does hold this opinion and 
according to a well-recognized rule as between the different Sunni 
Schools the difference of opinion is not such as is regarded a matter 
of conscience and absolute compliance, and it is open to a Qazi of 
one school to decide according to the doctrine of another school. I 
reproduce below two passages from Abdur Rahim's jurisprudence 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-23- 
 
which will clear the misapprehension that appears to exist on this 
question :- 
"No doubt the four teachers had each his own followers and 
these men, as time progressed, devoted themselves more and 
more to the task of developing the particular doctrines of their 
respective masters until we arrive at the age of the writers on 
Usul, when the labours of these jurists who devoted themselves 
to the separate systematization of the principles laid down by the 
early teachers must have accelerated the tendency to form into 
distinct Schools. But even in their time the question of a 
difference of opinion among the masters was regarded as a 
matter for discussion and controversy, and it was not supposed 
that, because a certain view had found vogue among the 
principal exponents of a particular School, it was on that account 
binding on the conscience of a Sunni Muhammadan or on the 
Courts of justice in preference to any other view which had the 
support of some other Sunni School. It was not until very modern 
times that attempt was made by means of the doctrine of Taqlid 
to confine the Court and the jurists to one of the four Schools of 
law as distinguished from the others" (page 178). 
"When a question depends upon juristic deduction a Qadi 
belonging to one School of Sunni law such as the Hanafi may 
decide it according to the Shafi'i law, if he prefers that view, or 
he may make over the case, to a Shafi'i Qadi for decision, if there 
is one available. In support of this a number of cases are 
mentioned. For instance, a Hanafi Qadi following the views of 
other Sunni Schools, in preference to those of his own School to 
the contrary, may declare that divorce by a drunken person is 
not valid, uphold a marriage contracted without two witnesses 
being present as valid, set aside the marriage of a minor 
contracted by his father in the presence of profligate witnesses, 
uphold the sale of a muddabar and perhaps of an ummi walad 
and so on. That this is the correct view of the law on the subject 
cannot be doubted not only upon principle but having in regard 
the array of authorities cited in its support, such as 
As-Siyaru'-I-Kabir, 
Jami'tul 
Futawa, 
Khazanutu'1-Muftiin, 
Majma'u'n-Nawazil, 
Al-Zakhira, 
Futawa 
Rashidu'd-din, 
Shaikhu’l-Islam,Abdu'1-Wahabu'ush-Shaibani, Shaikhu'1-Islam, 
Ata-ibn Hamza, and others. (Pages 180 and 181 of Abdur 
Rahim's Muslim Jurisprudence). 
27. The third reply is that we are really dealing with the interpretation 
of the Holy Qur'an and on a question of interpretation we are not 
bound by the opinions of jurists. If we be clear as to what the 
meaning of a verse in the Qur'an is, it will be our duty to give effect 
to that interpretation irrespective of what has been stated by jurists. 
"Atiullah-ha-wa Ati-ur-Rasul" is the duty cast on the Muslim and it 
will not be obedience to God or to the Prophet if in a cafe where our 
mind is clear as to the order of the Almighty or the Prophet we fail 
to decide in accordance with it. We are concerned here with the 
interpretation of the verse relating to khula and as. I have already 
stated its interpretation must be that the Court or the State has 
authority to direct a khula. Similar considerations apply to the 
interpretation of the traditions of the Prophet. 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-24- 
 
28. I will now deal with the cases that are cited against the right of 
the wife. The first case is Mst. Umar Bibi v. Mohammad Din. The 
allegations in that case were that the wife hated the husband and 
that it was not possible for her to live with her husband in peace and 
comfort. On these allegations two pleas were based : (1) The wife 
was entitled to a khula even though the husband be not willing, and 
(2) incompatibility of temperament, dislike or even hatred which 
arises justifiably or without justification can be a good ground for 
divorce. Abdur Rahman, J. (with whom Sir Traver Harries, C. J. 
agreed) recorded, in the first place, two preliminary findings, one 
relating to the jurisdiction of the Qazi and the other as to the 
meaning of the word "recognized" in section 2 (ix) of the Dissolution 
of Muslim Marriages Act. He was of the opinion that the jurisdiction 
which the Qazi exercised under the Muslim Law vested in the Civil 
Courts and he was of opinion too that although the word used in 
section 2 (ix) of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act is 
"recognised", it only means a ground on which a marriage could be 
dissolved if Muslim Law was applicable and did not imply that it was 
a ground which was already recognised by Muslim jurists. With both 
these conclusions I am in entire agreement. 
29. On the first question that was raised before him, i.e., one relating 
to the right of the wife to a khula, the learned Judge simply referred 
to the definition of khula in Hedaya, Durrul Mukhtar and Baillie 
where the word `khula' was stated to be either an agreement or an 
act of the husband, and after quoting the definition the learned 
Judge said that the definitions left "no room for doubt that in cases 
of khula, mubaraat or ordinary talaq it is a husband or a person 
(including the wife herself) who has been authorised by the husband 
who can effect a khula divorce and that it is not possible for a Qazi 
or a Court to do so (khula) in view of the powers vested in either of 
them." Beyond a reference to the definition there is no discussion of 
the subject at all and there is no reference to the verse of the Qur'an 
dealing with khula. 
30. On the second question the learned Judge began by saying :- 
"It will then become possible for any woman to get rid of the 
marriage tie-fickle minded and impressionable as she 
temperamentally is-on account of a passing fancy and besides 
being open to the objection that she would be taking advantage 
in that case of her own wrongful act and conduct, it will make the 
marriages more or less a farce." 
When the verse relating to shiqaq was relied upon before the 
learned Judge for the proposition that if breach is apprehended, the 
marriage can be dissolved, the learned Judge said- 
"But I do not read any such indication in the verse. It only 
provides for a procedure, as I read it, to bring about a 
reconciliation, and contains a direction to (Ul-il-Amr) or a Qazi to 
appoint an arbiter from the husband's relations and another from 
the wife's relations whenever a breach is apprehended between 
the spouses. There is nothing, however, in this verse which 
could be read as authorising the arbiters to dissolve the marriage 
bond if they are unable to bring about a settlement or 
reconciliation." 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-25- 
 
The learned Judge then quoted the passage from the Umedatul 
Qari which I have already reproduced and said- 
"It will be noticed that out of the four Imams, so well recognized 
in India, there is first of all a difference according to this 
commentary between three Imams in regard to the question 
whether the decision of arbiters, if they were unanimous, would 
be enforced with or without the permission of the husband as it 
was he alone who held the power to give a divorce-Imam Shafei 
and Imam Ahmad Ibn-i-Hambal being of the view that it could be 
enforced only with the husband's authority." 
31. This is, with all respect, not a correct interpretation of that 
passage. The authority of the Qazi has not in that passage been 
doubted. The only question was whether the arbiters could 
themselves effect a separation or whether the Judge's order was 
necessary. The learned Judge then quoted from Tafseer-i-Kabeer 
where there is cited an instance of Hazrat Ali that he directed the 
arbiters to separate the spouses if they came to the conclusion that 
they should be separated and ended by saying--- 
"I am thus of opinion that if an (Hakam) is not satisfied about 
(Shiqaq) (breach) or if he does not appoint arbiters from amongst 
the relations of either spouse or even when so appointed they 
do not agree as to separation, a divorce cannot be given. 
Moreover, according to the authorities to which I have referred I 
consider it doubtful whether a divorce could be given without the 
husband's consent even if the arbiters were agreed as to the 
separation. As to the tradition about Jameelah, wife of 
Sabit-bin-Qais reported, as above indicated, in Sahi-ul-Bokhari, 
it does not take us very much further. It is true that a divorce had 
been effected in that case but it must not be overlooked that the 
Prophet of Islam had ordered Sabit in that case to divorce his 
wife Jameelah in the words "Talaqaba Tatliqa" (give her an 
irrevocable divorce) according to the tradition reported at page 
794 and "Amreho Jafarqaha" (the Prophet ordered him and 
brought about separation) according to what is reported at page 
795. In either case the divorce is reported to have been granted 
by Qais and not pronounced by the Prophet although it may be 
admitted that out of reverence that Muslims had for the Prophet 
of Islam, it would have been impossible for Qais to disobey his 
order. The point, however, remains that the divorce was granted 
by Qais and not by the Prophet." 
32. So the learned Judge did accept at least in the beginning that if 
the Qazi finds shiqaq he can order a separation. I have already 
stated my interpretation of this verse. In all translations of the Holy 
Qur'an the word "Hakam" is translated only as judge or arbiter and 
`arbiter' cannot mean one who is merely a conciliator. There is also 
the incident of Hazrat Ali. In any case, the learned Judge too does 
not reject the proposition that the Qazi can dissolve the marriage if 
there is shiqaq and that is all that I say. I have already stated that 
between the circumstances that constitute shiqaq and those that 
lead to an apprehension that limits of God would not be observed 
there is little difference. 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-26- 
 
33. As regards the argument with respect to the Hadith relating to 
Sabit-bin-Qais that Sabit granted a divorce out of reverence for the 
Prophet, let me say, with all respect, that this is a misunderstanding 
of the attitude of the Holy Prophet towards his followers. The Holy 
Prophet never imposed his will on anybody where he was not 
entitled to force it as the Law-giver and the head of the State. He 
was very scrupulous of the rights of others. If in a matter where he 
was not entitled to pass an order it was his desire that a person 
should act in a particular manner, he would advise that person but 
at the same time would take care to point out to him that he was not 
bound to act in accordance with the advice and there are cases 
where the advice given was not accepted. The Holy Prophet would 
only order a person to do a thing if he as the head of the State was 
entitled to do so. 
34. The second and the more important case against the right of the 
wife is Sayeeda Khanam v. Muhammad Sami. In that case the wife 
had claimed a dissolution of marriage on grounds of cruelty, failure 
to maintain, failure to perform marital obligations, accusation of 
adultery, incompatibility of temperament and aversion. The trial 
Court held that incompatibility of temperament was proved but it 
found itself unable to give relief on that ground because of Mst. 
Umar Bibi v. Muhammad Din (A I R 1945 Lah. 51). It decreed the 
suit, however, on grounds of cruelty and accusation of adultery. Its 
findings as to cruelty in the words of Cornelius, A. C. J., were the 
following:- 
"The plaintiff had undergone many privations and sufferings. 
Owing to a mishap to a member of the husband's family shortly 
after she entered it by marriage, she was described as manhoos. 
Her visits to her own relations were disapproved, and she was 
beaten whenever she stayed with her relations too long. Visits 
by her relations to her were also disapproved, and these led to 
the husband suspecting her of immorality. He carried his 
suspicion so far that he would not let her go to the kitchen, in 
case she might meet the cook there. When she protested 
against his accusations of immorality, he beat her. He did not 
care for her to look well, and, therefore, refused to allow her to 
wash and dress her hair. Once in the presence of one of her 
friends he beat her with a broom." 
On appeal the learned District Judge disagreed with the trial Court 
on the question of cruelty. He was of opinion that the wife was 
self-willed and self-opinionated. He accepted that the wife disliked 
the husband but was of the opinion that she had to suffer this 
marriage till the husband gave her an excuse for getting the 
marriage dissolved. He said- 
"Among other things she seems to dislike her husband because 
she believes that he suffers from gout and also from some 
disease of the chest. I can understand the plaintiff's desire to get 
rid of a man whom she did not select and who is not up to her 
mark now, but so long as he chooses to retain her and so long 
as he does not give her an excuse for seeking the cancellation 
of her marriage with him, the ill-fated union must continue". 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-27- 
 
In the High Court, Kayani, J. (as he then was) was of the opinion 
that the above-quoted finding of the learned District Judge was 
sufficient to establish incompatibility of temperament. He was not 
inclined to agree with Mst. Umar Bibi v. Mohammad Din that 
incompatibility of temperament was not a good ground for 
dissolution and he referred the matter to a Full Bench. 
35. In the Full Bench, Cornelius, A. C. J., (with whom the other 
learned Judges of the Full Bench concurred) though he agreed that 
there was improper conduct by the husband did not accept that the 
circumstances of the case fell within "incompatibility” of 
temperament". I reproduce below his finding on this question 
verbatim:- 
"There are a number of acts of alleged cruelty adduced by the 
plaintiff, in regard to which she has led evidence, and for the 
purpose of determining whether there is indeed incompatibility 
of temperament, it is open to us to take these various acts into 
account. They have already been mentioned above, and having 
regarded them both individually and collectively with care. I fail 
to see in them proof of such a degree of difference of 
dispositions or of reactions to particular incidents and influences, 
or even of lack of sympathy as would qualify for the description, 
`incompatibility of temperament'. The instances are more readily 
traceable to bad manners, tendency to suspect the plaintiff’s 
character, tendency, to give expression to such suspicion, and 
tendency to use violence towards the wife, on the part of the 
husband. For the display of bad manners, the plaintiff was not at 
all responsible ; she did not time her arrival in the family herself 
and, therefore, it cannot be said that her husband's description 
of manhoos applied to her was his reaction to anything said or 
done by her. As regards the imputations of immorality, they arise 
out of visits by the plaintiff to her kitchen and to her relations, 
and here again, there is no question of reaction on the part of 
the husband to anything in the nature of a characteristic act by 
the plaintiff and, therefore, it is impossible to infer any clash of 
disposition here ; at the most, a defect of mentality in the 
husband may be deduced. To the same category belongs his 
refusal to allow her to dress and look well. There remain the 
allegations of beating, and this is also of unilateral effect 
indicating a fault in the nature of the husband. Therefore, I would 
be inclined to say that in the present case, the evidence is hardly 
adequate to draw a conclusion of incompatibility of temperament 
between the spouses. For that, it would be necessary, by means 
of inferences drawn from instances of behaviour as between the 
spouses, to gain an impression concerning the mental 
characteristics and the general disposition and frame of mind of 
each of the spouses and thereafter to draw the conclusion that, 
having the minds that they possessed, it was impossible for 
them to adapt themselves to each other, and, therefore, they 
were incapable of living together in harmonious association. As 
I have remarked, the evidence on the record is insufficient for 
making such a survey and examination of the mentalities of the 
spouses in this case." 
This finding would have disposed of the case but the learned Judge 
found that in the order of reference aversion towards the husband 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-28- 
 
which would constitute shiqaq was also mentioned as a ground for 
dissolution of marriage and as the factum of aversion was admitted, 
the learned Judge proceeded to consider whether shiqaq could 
furnish a ground for dissolution. HP dealt first with the tradition of 
the Holy Prophet relating to Jameela wife of 8abit. He was of the 
opinion that the version in the Hadith in Bokhari was a condensed 
one and did not state all the facts and be quoted the following 
extract from the Tafsir-ul-Kabir of Imam Razi :- 
"It has been reported that this verse (i.e. Verse 35 of Chapter IV) 
was revealed respecting the case of Jamila daughter of Abdullah 
son of Ubayy and her husband Sabet son of Qais son of 
Shenlas. The facts were that she hated him with intense hatred 
and he loved her with intense love. She came to the Holy 
Prophet and said : Effect separation between me and him and I 
hate him. I saw him, from the side of my veil, coming amongst 
people. He was of the shortest stature, the ugliest in face and 
blackest in complexion. I do not prefer infidetily (Kufr) after 
having accepted Islam. Sabet addressed the Prophet as follows 
`O Prophet of Allah, order her that she should return the garden 
I gave her'. The Holy Prophet said to her : `What have you to 
say'? She replied : 'I agree and I will give more'. Then the Holy 
Prophet said : `No, only the garden'. Then the Holy Prophet said 
to Sabet : Take from her what you gave and clear her way Sabet 
did this and it was the first khula in Islam." 
The learned Judge was of opinion that this was a case where the 
husband had himself made an offer to grant a divorce if the wife 
returned his orchard to him. He went on to say that if there was any 
doubt in his mind as to the correctness of interpretation that doubt 
was dispelled on a reference to the following two traditions of the 
Prophet :- 
"1. Saoban reported that the Messenger of Allah said: 
Whichever woman asks her husband for divorce without fault, 
the fragrance of paradise is unlawful for her. 
"2. Ibn Omar reported that the Apostle of Allah said: The most 
detestable of lawful things near Allah is divorce." 
It was quite natural for Cornelius, A. C. J., to accept the version 
given by so learned a person as Imam Razi and no further effort 
seems to have been made by learned counsel appearing in that 
case to find out the exact words used by the Holy Prophet or the 
manner in which the incident took place, i.e., whether it was just an 
offer by the husband or whether he granted a release in obedience 
to the order of the Holy Prophet. It was a matter to be decided with 
reference to the various versions given in the compilations of 
traditions, but even the version in the Tafsir-ul-Kabir is that when 
Jameela told the Holy Prophet that she found no fault with her 
husband but wanted a divorce as she hated him and said : "Effect 
a separation between me and him as I hate him". The Holy Prophet 
never said : "You have no ground for dissolution and I cannot 
dissolve the marriage. It is only if your husband agrees that you can 
get a release". If he was powerless to interfere (in fact, according to 
tradition No. 1 he should have told her that the fragrance of heaven 
would be unlawful to her if she asked for a divorce), that is what he 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-29- 
 
would have told her, but the Holy Prophet obviously sent for Sabit. 
He never told Sabit that it was up to him to agree or not. I have 
already stated and I repeat that the Holy Prophet was scrupulous 
about the rights of other persons and never assumed authority 
where he had none. He would always explain when he was giving 
advice that it was open to the person to whom he was tendering 
advice to accept his advice or not. One point to remember is that 
according to Tafsir-ul-Kabir, Sabit had intense love for Jameela. 
Does it seem reasonable to infer that he will agree of his own accord 
to give her a divorce. He would know well that the Prophet would 
not take it ill. That was the way of the Holy Prophet. He was never 
offended if his advice was not taken, for he recognized the rights of 
all to act as they like if they are not prohibited from so acting by law. 
Does the whole incident that is related in this Hadith create an 
impression that the Holy Prophet did not consider Jameela entitled 
to a dissolution. Even according to the Tafsir-ul-Kabir Sabit had said 
: "O Prophet of Allah, `order' her that she should return the garden 
I gave her." Was not the Holy Prophet passing orders? Sabit did not 
say "I am not prepared to grant a divorce till she returns my garden." 
He understood that the Holy Prophet was giving orders. And the 
Holy Prophet had said to Sabit : Take from her what you gave her 
and clear her way". Was this not an order ? When Jameela said she 
was prepared to give more, he said : "No, only the garden". This too 
was an order. The Holy Prophet was obviously deciding a case. 1t 
may also be stated here that although Imam Razi is entitled to great 
respect he is only a commentator and he has to take the tradition 
from some traditionist. His source is not stated and it is not clear 
wherefrom he got his version. If there was any real difference 
between his version and that in Bokhari, we would be entitled to 
accept the version in Bokhari. Cornelius, A. C. J., says this was 
according to Imam Razi, the first khula in Islam. Of course, it was, 
but it does not mean that it was just a matter of agreement. 
36. It is unfortunate that before the learned Judge only this tradition 
was quoted. If to this tradition had been added the other tradition 
relating to the other wife of Sabit Bin Qais and the orders passed by 
Hazrat Umar and Hazrat Usman in cases already referred to where 
they ordered the husband to grant khula, I wonder if the learned 
Judge's interpretation would not have been affected. It will be 
observed that Hazrat Umar and Hazrat Usman had used the word 
`khula' when passing orders so that it will be impossible to argue 
that khula can be the result only of an agreement and not of an order 
passed by the Qazi. It is noteworthy too that there is no reference 
in the judgment to the verse of the Qur'an which deals with khula 
although the discussion is as to the right of the wife to khula. The 
words 'in khiftum' in the verse which are according to unanimous 
opinion addressed to, the person in authority, the Judge or the `ulil 
amr' become wholly inappropriate if there is no authority which such 
person is to exercise. 
37. The learned Judge has regarded the two traditions quoted 
above as supporting the interpretation he has put on the tradition 
relating to Jameela. I say with great respect that they support the 
opposite interpretation. If a woman had not the right to get a khula 
without fault of the husband, what is the significance of saying that 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-30- 
 
if she asks for a divorce without fault of the husband, the fragrance 
of heaven will be denied to her ? It is only if she has option of asking 
for a divorce that this tradition will have a meaning. Sir Rowland 
Wilson (page 154 of the Anglo Muhammadan Law) has in a 
passage which I have already quoted anti which I will repeat, made 
the same inference from this Hadith. He says: 
"The Hadith in Tirmizi (1,368) that a woman who demands khula 
without necessity will lose heaven, implies that legally she Fan 
make good her demand, possibly without other reason than 
alleged `aversion' or in modern equivalent `incompatibility', but 
at least when she can satisfactorily show to impartial parties the 
impossibility of a happy married state." 
It is pertinent also to observe that the Holy Prophet was a party to 
the dissolution of the marriage of Jameela who was asking for a 
divorce without any fault of the husband, and if this tradition be 
accepted as authentic, he was a party to her deprivation of the 
fragrance of heaven. If the Hadith be authentic, it can only mean 
that religion grants rights to do acts which it disapproves and in fact 
the second tradition quoted is the strongest proof of this proposition. 
Divorce is regarded as detestable, yet divorce is allowed. No one 
would argue on the basis of the Hadith which says divorce is 
detestable that there is no power of divorce and similarly it cannot 
be argued that because fragrance of heaven will be denied to a 
woman who asks for a divorce without fault of the husband, she 
does not possess the option to have a khula. 
38. The learned A. C. J., then entered upon a discussion of the 
verse relating to shiqaq and held that the word `Hakam' did not 
mean either judge or arbiter as it appeared in the various 
translations of the Qur'an. He said :- 
"I am of the opinion that the meaning of the word `Hakama', 
which should be accepted for the purposes of placing a correct 
interpretation upon Verse 35, is that which is in contradistinction 
with the judicial function. Having regard again to the 
Organisation of society, among the peoples to whom this 
Scripture was revealed, viz., on a tribal and family basis, it 
becomes reasonably possible that by hakama is meant persons 
from the tribes of the respective spouses who exercise authority 
over the members of their tribes to such a way that they are 
capable of restraining such person from acting in any particular 
way, or from acting wrongly, and such persons could only be 
those who were acknowledged heads of the tribe, i.e., the 
legitimate chiefs or otherwise the elders of the tribes." 
No authority has been quoted for this interpretation and it is not 
suggested that the word `Hakam' has ever been used in the Arabic 
language in the sense of a tribal elder. This interpretation assumes 
(1) that some authority existed in the elders of the tribes even after 
the establishment of the Muslim State at Madina, and (2) that in all 
cases a person with tribal authority did exist and if in any case he 
did not exist, this verse could not be availed of. After the Muslim 
State had come into existence no authority was being exercised by 
the tribal elders over the members of the tribe. At the same time 
there is good orthodox opinion in favour of the proposition that

Hakam could be even from non-relatives if no relatives were 
available, the stipulation about relatives being only directory in 
nature. Let me here refer to page 209, Volume III of Tafsir-i-Haqani, 
a well-known and exhaustive commentary on the Qur'an where it is 
stated in the course of a comment on this verse that if people of the 
family be not available, any right-minded person can be appointed. 
39. The learned A. C. J., then considered various authorities and 
concluded by saying that even if the Hakam had the power of 
separation that would be no warrant for the conclusion that the Qazi 
had that power. The simple reply to this argument is that the right of 
the wife to obtain a dissolution cannot be affected by the fact that 
the procedure needed for the enforcement of that right appears to 
be such as cannot be adopted by these Courts. The law provides 
that in matters of marriage and divorce Muslim Law shall apply to 
the Muslims. If the Muslim Law provides; a particular procedure for 
the enforcement of a right of dissolution, either we regard that as a 
substantive provision and apply it as such or we regard that as a 
mere matter of procedure and having regard only to the substance 
of the right enforce it by whatever; procedure is available. But the 
right of the wife cannot be defeated. Either we should appoint 
Hakams or we should ourselves assume the jurisdiction of the 
Hakam in so far as It. relates to dissolution for that is a judicial 
function. 
40. The view taken by the learned A. C. J., assumes that the whole 
procedure prescribed in this verse is for reconciliation and the 
moment the Qazi appoints the arbiters he exhausts his jurisdiction. 
The case decided by Hazrat Ali was referred to by the learned 
Judge but he was of the opinion that Hazrat Ali only disapproved of 
the conduct of the husband who was not accepting the order of the 
Hakam. Following is the report of the incident as it appears in the 
Tafseer-i-Kabir (page 129): 
"Imam Shafei has reported a tradition from Hazrat Ali and that 
has been reported by lbn Sirin from Ubaida. It is to the effect that 
a man and a woman came to Hazrat Ali and each one of them 
was accompanied by a number of persons. Hazrat Ali ordered 
that one hakam should be appointed from the man's family and 
one from the family of the wife, and addressing the hukma, he 
said : Do you know what your duties are ? Your duty is to unite 
the couple if they can be united, and if you decide to separate, 
separate them.' The woman said she accepted what Allah had 
ordained whether the verdict be for or against her. But the 
husband said that he did not want separation. Hazrat Ali then 
said to the husband : `You have uttered a lie. You should also 
have given the same undertaking as your wife'." 
41. I would regard the word `Hakam' in its ordinary sense of judge 
or arbiter. One who is only a conciliator is neither a judge nor an 
arbiter and I am unable to accept that the jurisdiction of the Qazi is 
exhausted by the appointment of the, arbiter, that if the effort at 
reconciliation fails, there is nothing further to be done and that the 
wife must be forced to live with the husband even though she be 
unhappy and may be in no way to blame and though the result 
would be that the spouses "do not observe the limits of God". Take

the very case with which the Full Bench was dealing. I have already 
quoted the findings of fact of the learned A. C. J. The wife was 
regarded by the husband as `manhoos'. She was suspected by him 
of immorality and was not allowed to go even in the kitchen because 
there she would meet the cook. Yet she was forced to remain 
attached to the husband. Is this what Islam contemplates? Is it 
possible that the husband and the wife can under the circumstances 
live happily ? If the husband did not like the wife, he could divorce 
her at his will even though there was no blame on her. Yet the wife 
though she could not pull on with the husband without any fault in 
her, must be forced to live with him. Why should there be such a 
disparity between the rights of the spouses ? 
42. Let it not be understood that our answer to the question referred 
grants a right to wife to come to the Court at any time and obtain 
khula if she i9 prepared to restore the benefit she has received. 
There is an important limitation on her right of khula. It is only if the 
judge apprehends that the limits of God will not be observed, that 
is, in their relation towards one another, the spouses will not obey 
God, that a harmonious married state, as envisaged by Islam, will 
not be possible that he will grant a dissolution. The wife cannot have 
a divorce for every passing impulse. The judge will consider whether 
the rift between .the parties is a serious one though he may not 
consider the reasons for the rift. 
43. That the wife may go wrong if dissolution is not ordered is rather 
a reason for grant of dissolution for Islam prefers divorce to adultery. 
44. The rights of the spouses as regards dissolution may be 
summed up by saying that the husband can effect a dissolution 
himself by pronouncing a divorce, while the wife has to approach 
the Court and she is to get a dissolution only if the Court regards 
further continuance of the marriage as not proper. But if it does 
regard continuance of marriage as improper, there is no further 
limitation on its jurisdiction to dissolve the marriage. 
45. The answer to the question referred is that the wife is entitled to 
a dissolution of marriage on restoration of what She received in 
consideration of marriage if tie judge apprehends that parties will 
not observe the limits of God.” 
14.  
The above view of Full Bench of this Court was approved by 
the Supreme Court of Pakistan in Mst. KHURSHID BIBI versus 
Baboo MUHAMMAD AMIN (PLD 1967 Supreme Court 97) in the 
following words:-  
“A few words may now be said about the concept of marriage in 
Islam. As is well-settled, marriage among Muslims is not a 
sacrament, but in the nature of a civil contract. Such a contract 
undoubtedly has spiritual and moral overtones and undertones, but 
legally, in essence, it remains a contract between the parties which 
can be the subject of dissolution for good cause. In this respect, 
Islam, the Din-al-Fitrat, conforms to the dictates of human nature 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-33- 
 
and does not prescribe the binding together of a man and woman 
to what has been described as "holy deadlock." 
  The husband is given the right to divorce his wife, though, of 
course, arbitrary divorces are discountenanced. There is a saying 
of the Prophet to the effect that "the most detestable of lawful things 
in Allah's view is divorce" (
 البغض الحال الى هللا
طالق Abou Daood). 
Similarly, the wife is given the right to ask for khula in cases of 
extreme incompatibility though the warning is conveyed by ahadith 
against too free exercise of this privilege, one of which says that 
women asking for khula will be deprived of the fragrance of paradise 
(Trimizi)ايها المراة زوجها طالقاً من غير The warning both to man and 
باس محرام عليها رائحة الجنة) woman in this regard, is obviously placed 
on the moral rather than the legal plane and is not destructive of 
their legal rights. 
The Qur'an also declares: "Women have rights against men, 
similar to those that the men haye against them, according to the 
well-known rules of equity" (و لهن مثل الذى عليهن بالمعروف) It would, 
therefore, be surprising if the Qur'an did not provide for the 
separation of the spouses, at the instance of the wife, in any 
circumtances. The Qur'an expressly says that the husband should 
either retain the wife, according to well-recognised custom  امساك
بالمعروف " (Imsak-un-bil-ma'roof) or release her with grace- تسريح
باحسان " (Tasree-hun-bi-ihsan). The word of God enjoined the 
husband not to cling to the woman, in order to cause her injury      
"وال تمسكو هن ضراراً لتع
دو ت” . Another hadith declares-- "  ال ضرر وال
ضرار في االسالم (Lazarar-un-wa-la- zarar-fil-Islam) "Let no harm be 
done, nor harm be suffered in Islam". In certain circumstances, 
therefore, if the husband proves recalcitrant and does not agree to 
release the woman from the marital bond, the Qazi may well 
intervene to give redress and enforce the Qur’anic injunctions. 
As was pointed out by Kaikaus, J. in Mst. Balqis Fatima's case 
the foundation of the law relevant to khula is contained in the 
Qur'anic verses, which may be translated as follows: 
"Such divorce may be pronounced twice; then, either retain 
them in a becoming manner or send them away with. 
kindness. And it is not lawful for you that you take anything of 
what you have given them, unless both fear that they cannot 
observe the limits prescribed by Allah. But, if you fear that they 
cannot observe the limits prescribed by Allah, then it shall be 
no sin for either of them in what she gives to get her freedom. 
These are the limits prescribed by Allah, so transgress them 
not; and whose transgresses the limits prescribed by Allah, it 
is they that are the wrong-doers." 
  
We may first consider the opinions of the commentators of the 
Qur'an as to the meaning of these verses, bearing on khula. The 
words فان خفتم (if you fear) are addressed to the community or )    
اولى ال مر منكم  (those in authority from among you), and include the 
Qazi, who represents the community, for adjudication of disputes. 
This is borne out from the commentary of the Qur'an by Qurtabi, 
known as  الجامع االحكام القرآن "Al Ja'me-le-Ahkaam al- Qur'an". The 
learned author says that this is the opinion of Ibn-e-Abbas and 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-34- 
 
Malik-bin-Anas as well as the majority of the legists. Similar opinion 
is expressed by زمخشری Zamakhshri in his well-known commentary 
الكشاف (Alkashshaf), by نسفی(Nasafi) in his Tafseer, called  مدارک
التنزيل وحق
ايق التاويل (Madarak-ul-tanzil-wa-Haqaiq-ul- Ta'veel), by 
Baizavi (بيٖضاوی)in his Tafsir انوار التنزيل و اسرار التاويل 
Anwar-ul-Tanail-wa Israr-ul-Ta'veel, by القسطالنی(Al-Qastallani) in 
his  ارشاد السازی(Irshad-us-Sazi), by  جصاصJassas in his  احکام
القران(Ahkamul Qur'an) and by the authors of  تفسير ابن
کثير(Tafsir  Ibne Kasir) , and تفسير خازن(Tafsir Khazin). Baizavi 
distinctly says that this is so because the rulers are in a position to 
give orders when disputes are presented before them. In snore 
recent times, Mufti Muhammad Abduh of Egypt, in his 
Tafsir  Al  Manay تفسير المناhas endorsed this view. For analogy, the 
cases of لعان (li'an) and  ايال (‘Ila)
 عنين (Inin) and Mafqoodel Khabar 
(مفقود الخير)may be cited a in which cases the Qazi, it is settled, has 
the authority to separate the spouses, even if the husband is 
refusing to grant a divorce or is not available. The Hedaya, the 
ردالمحتار(Radd-ul-Muhtar) and the احکام القران(Ahkam-ul-Qur'an) of 
الجصاص(Aljasas) agree in this respect. 
   
By the phrase "Limits of Allah", according to the above-cited 
commentators, reference is intended to the injunctions regarding 
the performance of conjugal obligations while living together. 
Ibne-Hammam ابن همامin his فتح القدير(Fateh-ul-Qadir), Vol. III, p. 
199 and جص
اصJassas in his  احکام القران(Ahkamul Qur'an), Vol. 1, 
p. 391 have adopted this view which also finds mention in Sahih 
Bokhari (Arabic Text), published by Karkhana Tijarat-i-Kutub, 
Karachi (Vol. II, p. 794). It is explained that incurable aversion to the 
husband, on the part of the wife would be sufficient justification for 
khula. Shah Wali Amin Ullah of Delhi in ( المسوی من احاديث
الموطا)AI-Musawwa-min-H Ahadith-al-Muatta Vol. I1, p. 160) goes 
to the length of saying that "even if she obtains khul' without any 
reason (apart from personal dislike) it is lawful but not approved. 
The reason is that the Prophet and the Companions never inquired 
from her the reason for her (seeking) khul'." 
  
The question whether khula is to be equated with talaq, or it 
is a form of, dissolution of marriage in a category of its own, has 
been the subject of controversy amongst the jurists. Ibn-i-Rushud, 
in his Badaya-tul-Mujtahid, says that most of the ulema and Imam 
Malik and Imam Abu Hanifa are of the opinion that Khula is 
equivalent to talaq. On the other band, Imam Shafe'i, Imam Ahmad, 
Imam Daood and out of .the Companions, Ibn-eAbbas were of the 
view that khula amounts to fisk-i-nikah (cancellation or dissolution 
of marriage) ,and not talaq. Imam Shafe'i had also stated on another 
occasion that if the husband intended talaq, even in a contract of 
khula, it would operate as talaq and if he had the intention of 
fiskh-i-nikah, it will have effect as such. lbn-e-Hajar Asqlani in his 
books 
( اح
 تخرجة
 فى
الدراية  وفتح
 الهدايه
اديث
البارى)(Alderaya-fi-Takhrija-Ahadith-ul-Hidaya and Fat-hul-Bari) 
prefers the opinion of Ibn-e-Abbas on this point and casts doubt on 
the authenticity of the hadith which equates it with  ( طالق
باٰئن)(irreversible divorce). He relies in this connection on a Tradition 
of the Prophet, which specified that Sabet-bin-Qais's wife, after the 
grant of khula, was ordered to pass one period of menstruation as 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-35- 
 
her iddat and this would not be so if khula were talaq. He reiterates 
this position in (تلخ
يص الهبير)(Talkhisul Habir Vol. III, p. 205). On the 
other hand, the authorities quoted, on behalf of the respondent, 
including the Hedaya, take the view that there is no difference 
between khula and talaq. This question need not detain us further. 
There are good reasons for the view that khula is separation and 
not talaq, as the right of the husband to take back the wife after 
khula, does not exist, as it does in the case of talaq-i-raja'i and the 
period of Iddat is different is the two cases. The relevant Ahadith 
are discussed by Shaukani in کتاب الخلع (Kitab-ul-Khul Vol. 111, p. 
260) of his celebrated work (نيل ا االوطار) (Nail-al-Autar) and he 
reaches the conclusion that khula is not a type of talaq, but is a 
category apart t from it. If this opinion is accepted, then it is clear 
that khula is not dependent on the will of the husband alone. But 
even if khula be regarded as talaq as seems to be the view of some 
of the orthodox Hanafi Jurists, the question arises whether the wife 
is not entitled, in appropriate cases, to demand a khula divorce from 
the husband, in the face of the latter's opposition. This problem finds 
no  express treatment in the treatises of these Hanafi Jurists who 
content themselves by saying that divorce is the right of the 
husband. 
It must be admitted that this is also a controversial question. 
Dr. Sabum has summarized various opinions, bearing on this point, 
at page 621 of his book
 مدى حرية الزوجين فى الطالق. In particular he 
refers to what is related from Umar-ibn-Al-Khattab, through the 
authority of Behaqi, that he said that "when women desire khul’ do 
not deny it". Sha'rani in his book الميذان الکبری(Al-Mizan-ul-Kimiia, 
Vol. II, page 117) says: "Imams agree in that the woman, if she 
dislikes her husband because of his ugliness or misconduct she has 
a right to seek khul' by payment of compensation Even if there is 
nothing to cause her dislike and the husband and wife both agree 
upon khul; without any reason, it is lawful and is not condemned. 
  
On the contrary, Zuhri, Ata and Daud refute this stand by 
saying that "khul" in this case is futile and what is futile is unlawful 
and that which is unlawful is condemned". Dr. Sabuni in his book 
"Mada Hurriyat-al-Zaujain" at page 572, says "A large section of 
Muslim jurists believe that khula is lawful only with the existence of 
dislike on the part of the wife, so that the husbands may not start 
oppressing their wives to make them seek khul' so as to get back 
the property they gave to them." Badaruddin Ayni in his 
Umda-tul-Qari (عمدہ القاری) Vol. IX, p. 573 says: "There is difference 
of opinion in the case when both spouses agree; on separation, 
Malik, Auza'i and Ishaq are of the opinion that no Hakams are 
required and nor (further) permission of spouses. Kufis, Shaf'i and 
Ahmad have said that their permission is necessary, as the right to 
divorce is in the hands of the husband. If he permits, well 'and good; 
otherwise the Court will divorce on his behalf". 
   
This has reference to the well-known verse of the Qur'an, 
which requires Hakams to represent spouses to be appointed in 
case of shiqaq which means breach or schism between them, for 
the purpose of effecting reconciliation if possible and for ordering 
separation if that be necessary. Some of the legists have described 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-36- 
 
Hakams as merely Attorneys or arbitrators and not Judges, but 
others have said that they have full powers to decide as they think 
fit Some have held that the arbitrators' opinion is to be submitted to 
the Qazi,. who will .decide, in accordance with that opinion There is 
also difference of opinion among the legists as to whether reference 
on the Sultan (Sovereign) or Qazi is necessary, at all, or not. This 
will be found discussed by Ibn-e-Hazm in (المحلی) (Almohalla)., 
  
This difference, arises owing to the fact that two situations are 
contemplated by the writers. One is where khula takes place as a 
result of the mutual consent of the spouses, which is technically 
called mubara't. In such a case it appears that no reference to the 
Qazi is necessary. But where the husband disputes the right of the 
wife to obtain separation by khula, it is obvious that, some third party 
has to decide the matter and, consequently, the dispute will have to 
be adjudicated upon by the Qazi, with or without assistance of the 
Hakams: Any other interpretation of the Qur'anic verse regarding 
khula would deprive it of all efficacy as a charter granted to the wife. 
It is significant that according to the Qur'an, she can "ransom 
herself" or "get her release" and it is plain that these words connote 
an independent right in her. 
  
The Qur'anic injunctions must be interpreted in the light of 
well-known ahadith. The classical instance of khula is that of the 
wife of Sabet-bin-Qais-bin-Shamas. That tradition is to be found in 
various collections of ahadith, including Bokhari, Abu Daood, Nasai, 
Ibn-e-Maja and Tirmizi. But there are two versions, one referring to 
Jamila, daughter of a sister of Abdullah bin Abi Salool (in some 
versions, daughter of Abdullah and the other to Habiba, daughter of 
Sahl. It is said by some commentators that the two cases relate to 
two different wives of the same person. Jamila came to the Prophet, 
according to this tradition, and said that she had no reason to 
reproach Sabetbin-Qais, in respect of his morals or his faith, but she 
disliked him and after going into the fold of Islam, she did not want 
to commit infidelity. The Prophet asked her whether she was pre-
pared to return the garden given by her husband to her, in dower. 
She answered in the affirmative. The Prophet then directed the 
husband to accept the garden and to give her a divorce according 
to one version. Another version given by Bokhari, has it that when 
she agreed to return the garden to her husband, the Prophet 
ordered "Qats and he" separated her (امرہ ففارقها). From still another 
version given by Hazrat Aisha Siddiqa, (related by Abu Daud) it. 
seems that Habiba was also subjected by her husband to physical 
violence during the previous night but this fact was not put forward 
.by the woman, apparently, as ground for her release. Abu Daood 
also talks of two gardens being returned, which had been originally 
gifted by the husband. The two different versions may be reconciled 
by the suggestion that, due to her aversion, Habiba was not willing 
to perform her marital obligations and was beaten by her husband 
in consequence. The generally accepted account of Jamila's case 
as well as that of Habiba makes it clear that the only ground on 
which the Prophet ordered the woman to be released from the 
marriage bond, was her intense dislike of her husband. According 
to one text, she clarified that she found him to be ugly and repulsive, 
and in another that she felt like spitting at him. The Prophet being 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-37- 
 
convinced that the spouses could not live together in conformity with 
their conjugal obligations, ordered the husband to separate her. 
Hakim in Almustadrak  (المستدرک) Ibne-Abdul Barr in 
(االستعياب)(Al-Istiab), Sbaukani in Nail-ul-Autar (نيل اال وطار)the 
last-named (relying on Dar Qatani's version), are categorical in 
saying that it was the Prophet who ordered. the separation. As has 
been observed above, Ibne Hajr Asqlan'. shares this opinion and 
doubts the authenticity of the haditl, which specifies that this was a 
case of talaq. Ibne Hazm in AlMohalla upholds the Qazi's right to 
effect separation by khula, after efforts at conciliation through 
Hakams have failed. It is not possible to consider this act of the 
Prophet, except as one conceding the right of the wife, in 
circumstances of extreme discard. 
   
The opinion of Allama Ibne Rushud on this point has already 
been quoted in support of the thesis that khula is a right of the wife. 
Amir Ali in his Muhammadan Law, Vol. II, p. 466 and M. Muhammad 
Ali in his Religion of Islam p. 676, express themselves in similar 
terms. Some other modern opinions will be found collected in 
Kaikaus, J's judgment in Balqis Fatima's case including one by 
Wilson in his Anglo-Muhammadan Law. Kaikaus, J., has also cited 
the case of a woman who sought divorce from her husband in 
Hazrat Umar's time and after testing the seriousness of her demand 
by confining her in a dirty prison, he ordered her to be separated 
from her spouse. A modern priest of Egypt, Ali Khafif in his book 
Furaq-al-Zauj-fi-al Mazahib al Islamia ( فرق الزوج فی المذاهب
اسالميہ)strongly supports the wife's right to khul' when discord is 
established. I may add, however, that opinions of living authors are 
not entitled to as much weight as those who have joined the 
majority, since the possibility of their changing their views before 
death cannot be excluded. 
  
The present trend of legislation in Muslim countries which may 
provide indication of Ijma's in modern times, may also be examined. 
The right of the wife to obtain separation from her husband on any 
ground of (ضرار) (injury), is recognised in Iraq by section 40 of 
Qanun-ul-Ahwal-al-Shakhsiya of 1959, in Egypt by section 6 of Law 
No. 
25 
of 
1929, 
in 
Tunis 
by 
section 
25 
of 
Mujalla-tul-Ahwal-ul-Shakhsiya in Morroco by section 56 of 
Mudawwana-tul-Ahwal-ul-Shakhsiya-al-Maghrib, in Jordan by 
section 96 of Qanun-o-Huquq-al-Alla-tul-Urdani and in Syria by 
section 112 of Qanun-ul-Ahwal-ul-Shakhsiya-Assuri. In some of 
these Codes it is provided that the matter will first be referred to 
Hakams and the final decision will rest with the Court. 
  
The argument was raised on behalf of the respondent, that 
the case should be decided only in accordance with the opinions of 
Hanafi doctors, who contemplate the grant of a divorce on the part 
of the husband even in the case of khula and not separation such 
as could be ordered by a Qazi. The authorities referred to, however, 
do not discuss what would happen in case the husband is reluctant 
to divorce the wife but the relations between the spouses have 
deteriorated so considerably that they could not be expected to live 
together within the limits of Allah. Such a position is expressly dealt 
with in books of other Sunni sects-the Malikis, the Shafe'is and the 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-38- 
 
Hambalis. It is permissible to refer to those opinions which are 
consistent with the Qur'anic injunctions. A certain amount of fluidity 
exists, even among orthodox Hanafis in certain matters. In the case 
of a husband who has become mafqudulkhabar (absent without 
news) for instance, Malikis opinion can be resorted to by a Hanafi 
Qazi, as is mentioned in Radd-ul-Muhtar. 
   
There is a hadith of the Prophet, concerning Barairah who was 
married to a slave, named Mughis. She did not live with her husband 
who followed her disconsolate and weeping, in public. The Prophet 
advised her to go back to her husband. She asked: "Is this an 
order?" The Prophet said that it was merely a recommendation. She 
then declined to go back to her husband, saying: "I 'have no need 
of him." This shows that a woman cannot be compelled, if she has 
a fixed aversion to 'her husband, to live with him. 
  
The reasoning that found favour in the cases of Umar Bibi and 
Sayeeda Khanam may also be briefly noticed. Those reasons were 
analysed by Kaikus, J. in Balqis Fatima's case and with respect, it 
seems to me, justification was shown to exist for departing from the 
earlier view. a Sir Abdur Rahman, J. in Umar Bibi's case relied on 
Baillie's Digest of Muhammadan Law, First Part, p. 305, the 
Hedaya, Book. 1, Vol. IV, Chapter on khula and the corresponding 
Chapter in Durr-ul-Mukhtar and held that even in khula cases; it is 
the right of the husband to effect separation, by granting a divorce. 
These authorities, however, do not consider contentious cases, 
where the husband refuses to release the wife, out of pure 
obstinacy. The learned Judge also expressed the opinion that even 
where there was mutual dislike or extreme incompatibility of 
temperament between husband -and wife there can be muaddat 
(مودت), sukoon سکون and rehmat رحمتin the married life (declared 
to be objectives of marriage by the Qur'an), with the procreation of 
children. With respect, it seems to me, that this view is difficult to 
sustain. In such cases, if there is fixed aversion on the part of the 
wife or the husband, life becomes a torture for both. The learned 
Judge also thought that the first condition for. separation between 
the spouses is that Hakams should have been appointed, in 
accordance with the injunctions of the Qur'an, and it would be for 
them to consider whether the couple should be parted or not. But if 
the Hakams can so decide under authority of an order by the Qazi, 
I confess, it is difficult to see why a Qazi does not possess a similar 
capacity in suitable cases. It is said in the Mabsoot of Al-Sarakhsi, 
Vol. 11 that the Qazi has the power to remove cause's of tyranny by 
means of talaq. It is also in the Radd-ul-Muhtar that, for this 
purpose, the Qazi becomes the agent of the husband, if he refuses 
to give divorce. 
  
In Sayeeda Khanam's case, the verse bearing on the right of 
khula, was not noticed, though the hadith in respect of Jamila, . wife 
of Sabet-bin-Qais-was discussed. The opinion was expressed in 
that judgment that the decision of the Prophet in that case was not 
to be regarded as a decree, awarded by him in the capacity of a 
Judge or as the Head of the State of, Islam. It was thought that, as 
the husband was agreeable to the separation, on the delivery back 
to him, of his garden, this was a separation by mutual consent, and 
it was in consequence of this that the Prophet gave his direction. It

would be more consistent, in by humble opinion, with the letter and 
spirit of the Qur'an which places the husband and the wife on an 
equal footing, in. respect of rights of one against the other, to 
construe this incidents a meaning that the person in authority, 
including the Qazi, can order separation by khula even if ,the 
husband is not agreeable to that course. Of course the Qur'anic 
condition must be satisfied that it is no longer possible for the 
husband and the wife to live together in harmony and in conformity 
with their obligations. 
After a discussion of the original sources, I have, therefore, 
reached the conclusion that the view, taken by Kaikaus, J. in Balqis 
Fatima's case, that the relevant verse of the Qur'an gives the right 
of khula to the wife subject to the limitation mentioned therein is 
correct. 
In the present case, on the facts, it has been found that there 
is no possibility left, of the parties residing together in amity and 
goodwill. There has been litigation between them. The wife had to 
be brought away from the husband's house, on a warrant, issued 
under section 100, Criminal Procedure Code. She may have taken 
an intense dislike to her husband, after he contracted his second 
marriage, but ever since that time, she has consistently declined to 
share the connubial bed with him. In the circumstances, it would be 
idle to have recourse to the formality of appointing Hakams to 
attempt a reconciliation between them, considering that a 
Panchayat, convened by the defendant's father, also failed, in this 
respect. I would9 therefore, hold that the plaintiff is entitled to 
separation from her husband, by khula, in the circumstances of the 
instant case. 
The next question is on what terms, such a decree should be 
granted to her. Unfortunately, in the trial Court, the question of terms 
was not gone into, on either side, and the trial Judge also failed to 
advert to this aspect of the matter. There is no material on the file, 
from which it can be ascertained how much money, if at all, the 
husband had given to the wife, on the occasion of the marriage, and 
on receipt of what compensation he would be willing to grant her 
khula. The pleadings of the parties show that the dower, whatever 
its amount was, had not yet been paid to the wife. She merely 
express her willingness to relinquish her dower, but the husband 
said, he was not agreeable even, on this condition, to grant her 
khula. He did not plead that he had actually paid her the dower. 
Though, according to the Hedaya, it is abominable on the part of the 
husband to have more than the dower itself, in a case of separation 
by khula, yet if he insists, it is legally permissible for him to demand 
something more than the dower, and to the extent that he might 
have been out of pocket, in respect of gifts, given to the wife on 
marriage, he may, in law, demand restitution. This would 
necessitate an enquiry into the facts -and the final decision as to 
what compensation must be paid by the wife for he relief, must rest 
with the Court. I would, therefore, allow the appeal and send back 
the case to the trial Judge, with the direction the parties may be 
permitted to lead evidence to what gifts, if any, and of what value, 
were given by the husband to the wife, on the occasion of the 
marriage, so that if the husband wants to take more than the dower, 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-40- 
 
the condition may be imposed on the wife, to pay the additional sum, 
expended by the husband on her, to the grant of khula. The parties 
may be left to bear their own costs throughout in the circumstances 
of the case. (Some of the original authorities referred to in this 
judgment have been collected together by me in the form of an 
appendix to this judgment.” 
After having an overview of well settled principle of law, there 
remains no cavil that a woman can seek “khula” from the court as of 
right if she has fixed aversions to her husband.  
15.  
Now adverting to the scope and import of word 
“reconciliation” used in Section 10(5) of the “Act, 1964”, it is 
observed that since it is nowhere defined in the “Act,1964” itself, so 
in order to properly comprehend its meaning, we have to seek 
guidance from dictionary meaning from various law dictionaries, 
which are as under:- 
The Black’s Law Dictionary describes the meaning of 
“Reconciliation” as under:- 
Restoration of harmony between persons or things that had 
been in conflict <a reconciliation between the plaintiff and the 
defendant is unlikely even if the lawsuit settles before trial> 
Family law. Voluntary resumption, after a separation, of full 
marital relations between spouses <the court dismissed the 
divorce petition after parties’ reconciliation>. Accounting. An 
adjustment of accounts so that they agree, esp. by allowing 
for outstanding items <reconciliation of the checking account 
and the bank statement>”  
Oxford, Advanced Learner’s Dictionary portrays the meaning of 
“Reconciliation” as under:- 
an end to a disagreement and the start of a good relationship 
again: Their change of policy brought about a reconciliation 
with Britain. the process of making it possible for two different 
ideas, facts, etc. to exist together without being opposed to 
each other;  
Cambridge Dictionary articulates the meaning of “Reconciliation” 
as under:- 
A situation in which two people or group of people become 
friendly again after they have argued; It took hours of 
negotiations to being about a reconciliation between the two 
sides. 2. The process of making two opposite beliefs, ideas, 
or situations agree.  
Whereas, Webster’s Dictionary explains the meaning as under:- 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-41- 
 
An act of reconciling for the state of being reconciled  2. The 
process of making consistent or compatible. 
16.  
From the collective analysis of dictionary meaning of 
“Reconciliation” as noted hereinabove, we can infer that its true 
import is to bring an end to the differences through meaningful and 
concrete effort. In other words, word “reconciliation” postulates 
adoption of such measures as can be proved as a factor for 
harmonious union between the spouses after redress of grievances 
which had led them to have recourse to litigation.  
17.  
Reconciliation and harmony amongst the spouses are one of 
the main themes of the injunction of Islam. In Surah Al-Nisa, Ayat 
35, Allah Almighty obligates the elders and close relatives of the 
spouses to put all possible efforts for bringing an end to the 
unpleasant rift between them. For ready reference, same is 
reproduced:-

Pakistan is a Federal republic and in terms of Article 2 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, Islam is the 
State religion of Pakistan. Chapter 2 of the Constitution deals with 
Principles of Policy and one of the principles highlighted therein is 
embodied in Article 31, which states that steps shall be taken to 
enable the Muslims of Pakistan, individually and collectively, to 
order their lives in accordance with the fundamental principles and 
basic concept of Islam and to provide facilities, whereby they may 
be enabled to understand the meaning of life according to the Holy 
Qur’an and Sunnah. Article 35 of the Constitution, being part of the 
Chapter 2, ordains that the State shall protect the marriage, the family 
and mother and the child. Reference to this effect can also be made 
to HAMMAD HUSSAIN versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-42- 
 
through Secretary, Ministry of Law and Justice, Islamabad and 
another (PLD 2022 Federal Shariat Court 21), wherein the Federal 
Shariat Court, while dealing with Section 10(3) of the “Act, 1964”, 
held as under:- 
“2. 
We have heard the arguments and reached at the 
following conclusions: 
i) 
it is correct understanding of the petitioners that in 
Islamic society, the protection of family unit or family 
system has core-importance, which is rightly reflected 
in Article 35 of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973 
stating one of the principles of policies in the 
Constitution. Article 35 states that "the State shall 
protect the marriage, the family, the mother and the 
child"; 
ii) 
in the light of Quran and Sunnah, divorce is legally 
permissible but it is considered as the most abhorrent 
and unpleasant act; therefore, Quran and Sunnah 
stress upon reconciliation and compromise to be 
made between the spouses in case of any unpleasant 
rift occurs between them to avoid divorce. The Quran 
puts a moral and religious duty upon the elders and 
family members of the parties to put efforts for making 
a compromise between the spouses in case any 
unpleasant rift occurs between them. The referred 
Ayat of Sura Al-Nisa explains the manner in which 
such reconciliation efforts may be made between the 
parties within the family. The Ayat 35 of Sura Al-Nisa 
is directed for the family members and elders of the 
conflicting spouses for making compromise or doing 
efforts for reconciliation between them. For 
ready-reference, the Ayat 35 of Sura Nisa is 
reproduced below: 
 ْهْ لِهِ وَ حَ كَم ًۭ ا مِّ ن

3. 
This matter was very clearly decided by this Hon'ble 
Court in Para-8 of its earlier judgment dated 04.07.2013, 
whereby Sh. Petition No. 20-I of 1999 titled "Muhammad 
Zoonnoon Khan v. Federal Government of Pakistan and 
another" and Sh. Petition No.06-I of 2010 titled "Muhammad 
Shah, etc. v. The State" in which it was pointed out that the 
authority given to Family Court for reconciliation or 
compromise at pre-trial proceedings under section 10 of the 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-43- 
 
Family Courts Act, 1964 or after conclusion of trial under 
section 12 of the said Act, is adopted on the basis of Verse 35 
of Sura Al-Nisa of Holy Quran.  
 
The reference made by the petitioners to the Holy 
Quran and Sunnah while challenging Section 10(3) of the 
West Pakistan Family Courts Act (Act XXXV of 1964) and 
section 10(3) of the Family Courts Act, 1964 (As amended for 
Punjab) is completely misconceived. Hence, the Shariat 
petition is dismissed accordingly and the Shariat 
Miscellaneous Application No.4-I of 2021 being infructuous is 
disposed of.” 
19.  
Subsection (3) of Section 10 of  the “Act, 1964”  though 
postulates that the Family Court may, at the pre-trial stage, ascertain 
the points of controversy between the parties and attempt to effect 
compromise between them but neither the “Act, 1964” nor the rules 
framed thereunder provides any procedure for the said purpose. It 
has been thus left to the discretion of the Family Court to do so, 
keeping in view the peculiar facts and circumstances of each case. 
Even otherwise, no hard and fast rules can be laid to bound down the 
Family Court to strictly follow the same for the purpose of effecting 
compromise or bringing reconciliation between the parties. A Family 
Court cannot compel a party for reconciliation against his/her will. It 
may not be difficult for someone to take the horse to the water but at 
the same time he cannot make him drink. Law only requires from a 
Family Court to make a genuine and concrete attempt for 
reconciliation between the parties. Guidance in this respect can be 
sought from SOHAIL AHMED versus Mst. SAMREENA RASHEED 
MEMON and another (2024 SCMR 634), wherein Supreme Court 
of Pakistan has held as under:- 
“14. 
The proviso to section 10 empowers the Family Courts 
to pass a preliminary decree for the dissolution of Marriage 
forthwith upon the failure of reconciliation and further provides 
that wife shall be ordered toreturn the Haq Mehr received by 
her. 
15. 
Section 10(3) imposes a legal obligation on the Family 
Courts to make a genuine attempt for reconciliation between 
the parties. Trial Court shall remain instrumental and make 
genuine efforts in resolving the dispute between the parties. 
In case if despite of genuine efforts, reconciliation fails, the 
Trial Court under proviso of section 10(4), without recording 
evidence is empowered to pass a decree of dissolution of 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-44- 
 
marriage forthwith. At this juncture if the court observes that 
the wife without any reason is not willing to live with her 
husband, then under proviso (ibid) the Court is left with no 
option, but to dissolve the marriage.” 
20.  
In the case of AMANAT ALI versus Mst. NADIA SHAUKAT 
(PLD 2019 Lahore 160), learned Single Bench of this Court, while 
outlining the scope of Section 10(3) as amended by The Punjab 
Family Courts (Amendment) Act, 2015 observed as under:- 
 
“6. …From the reproduction of Section 10(3) as above, it 
depicts that before amendment the legislature used the word 
"shall" in order to determine the points at issue between the 
parties and try to effect a compromise of reconciliation 
between the parties, however„ after amendment in the Section 
10(3), the word "may" has been used in place of "shall", which 
means that it is not mandatory for the Court seized with the 
matter to effect compromise of reconciliation between the 
parties, rather, it is subject to the facts of the case or if the 
Court deems necessary for the same. In the present case, on 
15.12.2018, when the case was fixed for reconciliation, 
respondent No.1 recorded her categorical statement before 
the learned Judge Family Court, Lahore which is reproduced 
herein below: 
 بيان ازاں ناديہ شوکت دختر15-12-2018 
:برحلف 
 ميری شادی7
 اپريل2018
 کو امانت کے ساتھ ہوئئ تھی۔ ميرا خاوند مجھے
 خرچہ نہ ديتا ہے۔ مجھے کہتا ہے کہ گھر والوں سے خرچہ ال کر مجھے دو
مجھے مارتا ہے نشہ اور گالی گلوچ کرتا رہت ا ہے۔ ميں مصالحت نہ کرنا چاہتی
 ہوں۔ عدالت  سے خلع لينا چاہتی ہوں۔ ہمارے درميان مصالحت کی گنجا ش نہ
ہے۔ 
Aforementioned, statement of respondent No.1 clearly shows 
that she has refused to join the petitioner due to his alleged 
cruel attitude and she categorically denied the possibility of 
reconciliation with the petitioner. So, in the light of relevant law 
as stated above, it was not mandatory for the Family Court to 
effect compromise between the parties when the lady was not 
ready to do so. Even, on the same the stance of the petitioner 
was also recorded by the learned Judge Family Court which 
the respondent No.1 not accepted. 
Moreover, the above quoted section and particularly the 
proviso to its subsection (4) is fully in consonance with Muslim 
Law. The Legislature while introducing amendment in the 
Family Courts Act, 1964 has derived wisdom from Quran and 
Sunnah….” 
21.  
Sub-Sections (3) and (5) are interlinked and none can be read 
in isolation to the other. Section (5) of Section 10 of the “Act, 1964” 
commands the Family Court to immediately pass a decree for 

Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
-45- 
 
dissolution of marriage on failure of reconciliation proceedings. No 
shatters thus can be placed upon the power of the Family Court to 
dissolve the marriage on the basis of “khula”, when reconciliation is 
not possible. Reference to this effect can be made to KHURRAM 
SHEHZAD versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through Ministry 
of Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan, Islamabad and another 
(PLD 2023 Federal Shariat Court 286).  
22.  
In the wake of above-noted threadbare discussion, now 
adverting to the merits of the case, it is noticed that on institution of 
suit for dissolution of marriage on the basis of “khula” by the 
“respondent”, the petitioner appeared before the Family Court, 
Rawalpindi, who in terms of Section 10(3) of the “Act, 1964” fixed 
the date for pre-trial reconciliation proceedings but it evinces from 
the record that despite efforts, parties did not arrive at reconciliation, 
as the “respondent” was not willing to reconcile with the petitioner 
at any cost. As already observed, court cannot compel any party to 
effect compromise against his/her wishes instead can make a genuine 
effort to bring reconciliation between the parties amicably. 
23.  
The nutshell of above discussion is that the petitioner has 
failed to point out any illegality or perversity in the impugned order 
passed by the learned Family Court, resultantly, this petition fails and 
is dismissed with no order as to costs.

This application is in terms of Section 114 read with 
Order XLVII of the Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908) 
seeking review of the judgment dated 12th June, 2024 passed 
in Writ Petition No.167 of 2024. 
2. 
The grievance agitated by the applicant in this 
application is restricted to Paras No.4, 12 & 14 of the 
reproduced portion of judgment reported as Mst. BALQIS 
FATIMA versus NAJM-UL-IKRAM QURESHI (PLD 1959 (W.P.) 
Lahore 566) more specifically highlighting the view of 
Quadiani Group, which was further affirmed by the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in the case of Mst. KHURSHID BIBI versus 
Baboo MUHAMMAD AMIN (PLD 1967 Supreme Court 97) find 
mentioned as Para No.2 at page No.37 of the judgment 
under review. 
3. 
The review is sought on the ground that after the 
promulgation of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 in terms of Article 260 a person of the 
Quadiani Group or the Lahori Group who call themselves 
‘Ahmadis’ or by any other name have been declared as non-
Muslim. 
4. 
In view of averments in the application notice is 
issued to the learned Advocate General, Punjab. At this 
stage, Mr. Muhammad Shahid Munir, Assistant Advocate 

General Punjab accepts notice, so there is no need to issue 
any formal notice to this effect. 
5. 
As already observed that the applicant is only 
aggrieved of certain portion of reproduced extract from the 
judgment in the cases of Mst. Balqis Fatima supra and Mst. 
Khurshid Bibi supra more specifically Paras No.4, 12 & 14 
of the judgment of the former case and Para No.2 
reproduced at page No.37 of the judgment under review 
from the latter case.  
6. 
Needless to observe that the above-mentioned Paras 
were only reproduced as extracts from the above referred 
judgments and with the promulgation of the Constitution of 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and more specifically 
by inserting definitions of “Muslim” and “non-Muslim” in 
Article 260(3)(a)  & 260(3)(b), the observations recorded in 
the above referred judgments automatically loses their 
efficacy as well as status and there remains no cavil to 
observe that a person of the Quadiani Group or the Lahori 
Group who call themselves “Ahmadis’ or by any other name 
or a Bahai, and a person belonging to any of the Scheduled 
Castes cannot be termed as “Muslim” or class/sect of 
“Muslim”.  
7. 
With these observations this review application with 
consent of all in attendance is accordingly disposed of. The 
observations recorded hereinabove shall be treated as part of 
judgment dated 12th June, 2024 passed in Writ Petition 
No.167 of 2024.
