MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J. / MEMBER:- This 
consolidated judgment shall decide instant appeal along with 
following connected appeals as common questions of law and facts 
are involved in these cases, however are bifurcated into Category 
“A” (appeals challenging retirement order passed under section 12 
of the Punjab Civil Servants Act, 1974) and Category “B” (appeals 
seeking expunction of adverse remarks in the PERs):- 
CATEGORY “A”  
 
 
 
 
Service Appeals No.16, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29 & 30 of 2015. 
CATEGORY “B”  
 
Service Appeals No.10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 23, 24 & 
25 of 2016. 
2. 
Through these appeals, appellants have assailed vires of the 
show cause notices and subsequent notification dated 02.06.2015, 
issued by the respondent / Registrar, Lahore High Court, Lahore, 
whereby appellants were retired from service under Section 12 of 

 
Service Appeal No.15 of 2015 & connected cases 
2
the Punjab Civil Servants Act, 1974 (“the Act of 1974”). 
Appellants have also assailed orders dated 05.09.2016 dismissing 
their representations against adverse remarks appearing in their 
respective PERs and sought expunction of the adverse remarks. 
3. 
Learned counsel for appellants submits that the adverse 
remarks in the Performance Evaluation Reports (“PERs”) of the 
appellants stood ignored in view of the decision of the 
Administration Committee dated 30.06.1997 as the appellants 
afterwards earned satisfactory reports. He further submits that 
appellants have been compulsorily retired from service without 
adopting the due process of law. He adds that compulsory 
retirement is a major penalty as defined under Section 4(b)(iv) of 
the Punjab Employees Efficiency, Discipline and Accountability 
Act (“PEEDA Act”), 2006. He maintains that Section 12(1)(i) of 
the Act of 1974 is inconsistent with the fundamental rights of the 
appellants as after insertion of Article 10-A of the Constitution of 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (“the Constitution”) 
through 18th amendment, right of fair trial has been provided to all 
the citizens of Pakistan, however, unfortunately, neither any charge 
has been framed nor any regular inquiry has been conducted in the 
matter before passing the impugned adverse order. He argues that 
in view of guidelines provided in the Punjab Civil Servants 
(Directory Retirement from Service) Rules, 2021 (“the Directory 
Rules of 2021”), impugned orders are unsustainable in the eye of 
law. While referring to Explanation to Section 12 of the Act of 
1974, learned counsel submits that the appointing authority for 
civil servants in Grade-19 and above is the Chief Minister and the 
Hon’ble Chief Justice and Judges have not been designated as 
‘appointing authority’ to take action in terms of section 12(1)(i) of 
the Act of 1974. Appellant-Anwar Ali in Service Appeal No.27 of 
2015 contends that he had not possessed requisite service of twenty 
years at the time of issuance of impugned Notification, thus the 
same is unsustainable in the eye of law. In support, he has referred 
to Atta Rabbani v. Secretary Education, Government of the 
Punjab, Lahore and 3 others (2006 SCMR 978), Muhammad Afzal 

 
Service Appeal No.15 of 2015 & connected cases

v. Regional Police Officer, Bahawalpur and others (2011 SCMR 
1327), Muhammad Afzal v. Regional Police Officer, Bahawalpur 
and others [2012 PLC (C.S.) 728], Muhammad Sharif Abbasi v. 
Member Water, WAPDA, Lahore and others (2013 SCMR 903), 
Muhammad Shoaib Ahmed v. The Controller General of Accounts, 
Islamabad (2020 SCMR 1018), Member (Administration), Federal 
Board of Revenue and others v. Mian Khan (2021 SCMR 1077), 
Muhammad Sharif v. Inspector General of Police, Punjab, Lahore 
and another [2016 PLC (C.S.) 1083], Zia-ul-Qamar v. The 
Registrar, Lahore High Court Lahore [2017 PLC (C.S.) Note 64], 
Sheikh Shahid Rafiq v. The Registrar, Lahore High Court, Lahore

The Registrar, Peshawar High Court, Peshawar [2020 PLC (C.S.)

Shah [2020 PLC (C.S.) 593] and Syed Asghar Shah, AD&SJ v. 
Peshawar High Court, Peshawar through Registrar [2020 PLC 
(C.S.) 1254].  
4. 
Conversely, learned Legal Advisor for respondent defends 
the impugned show cause notice as well as impugned order by 
contending that direction made under Section 12(1)(i) of the Act of 
1974 is not a punishment within the Punjab Civil Servants 
(Efficiency & Discipline) Rules, 1999 (“the E&D Rules, 1999”) 
and such order is not ordinarily interfered with if the requirements 
of “public interest” are satisfied. He adds that procedure and nature 
of action for exercise of powers under the said provision of law is 
entirely independent of the action anticipated by the E&D Rules, 
1999.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused.  
6. 
The primary question for determination by this Tribunal is 
that whether mandatory requirements for invocation of provisions 
of Section 12 of the Act of 1974, have been fulfilled by the 
competent authority while passing the impugned order / 

 
Service Appeal No.15 of 2015 & connected cases 
4
Notification. The aforesaid provision is reproduced hereunder for 
ease of reference:- 
 
“12. 
Retirement from service.- (1) Civil Servant shall retire 
from service- 
 
(i) 
on such date after he has completed twenty years of 
service qualifying for pension or other retirement benefits as the 
competent authority may, in public interest, direct; or  
(ii) 
where no direction is given under clause (i): 
(a)  on completion of the sixtieth year of his age; or 
(b)  voluntarily, on completion of twenty five years of service or 
on attaining fifty five years of age, whichever is later. 
 
(2) 
No direction under clause (i) of sub-section (1) shall be 
made until the Civil Servant has been informed in writing of the 
grounds on which it is proposed to make the direction and has 
been given a reasonable opportunity of showing causing against 
the said direction.” 
7. 
It reflects from afore-referred provision that the pre-
requisites i.e. (i) civil servant must have completed twenty years of 
service at his credit for pension or other retirement benefits; (ii) 
direction of retirement of civil servant must be in public interest; 
(iii) civil servant must be informed of the grounds of such 
direction; and (iv) civil servant must be provided reasonable 
opportunity of showing cause against the proposed direction, must 
co-exist for invoking said provision. The legislature has taken care 
of incorporating all legal and constitutional safeguards in afore-
referred provision so as to ensure that the civil servant could be 
safe and secure from any unilateral, mala fide and unlawful 
retrenchment.  
8. 
In these cases, proper show cause notices with reference to 
applicable provisions of law and case law with full detail of 
allegations, pending complaints and remarks in PERs were served 
upon the appellants to which they furnished their respective written 
replies. The element of public interest has also been rightly 
evaluated by the competent authority keeping in view the service 
record of appellants and nothing contrary has been presented 
before us. The order of retirement has been passed after due 
process of law and fulfilling the pre-requisites to invoke section 
12 of the Act of 1974.

9. 
The record transpires that all the appellants had completed 
the requisite twenty years’ service. The expression public interest 
implies a matter relating to the people at large, nation or a 
community as a whole and if the interest of general public or 
community is not involved in a matter, it cannot be brought within 
the purview of public interest. The requirement of public interest 
may vary from case to case, however an order passed by the 
competent authority under section 12(1)(i) of the Act of 1974 must 
have reasonable nexus with the public interest. The assessment of 
the performance of a civil servant to judge his suitability must not 
be based on the personal reasons or considerations not related to 
the public interest. Ordinarily, Tribunal or Court is not supposed to 
substitute reasons for public interest and order under Section 12 is 
not interfered with as satisfaction of the competent authority 
regarding efficiency and performance of an employee is not to be 
substituted by the Court or Tribunal with its own opinion on the 
basis of analysis of the record. The justiciability of Section 12 is 
restricted to the fulfilment of necessary conditions contained 
therein. Reliance is placed upon Muhammad Qadeer and 2 others 
v. Secretary, Defence Production Division, Government of 
Pakistan and others (2003 SCMR 1804), Chairman, Central 
Board of Film Censors, Islamabad and another v. S. Muhammad 
Ali Shah [2004 PLC (C.S.) 707], Atta Rabbani v. Secretary 
Education, Government of the Punjab, Lahore and 3 others (2006 
SCMR 978) and Atta Rabbani v. Secretary Education, Government 
Of The Punjab, Lahore and 3 others [2007 P L C (C.S.) 608],  
10. 
Needless to observe that the object of section 12 is to 
develop efficiency and discipline and achieve good governance in 
the civil service. A civil servant who has served a considerable 
length of twenty years with a minimum level of efficiency loses 
legitimate expectancy to perform better in future and only want to 
stay with the sort of performance, which may be in his / her 
interest, but certainly not in the interest of public. We are mindful 
of the fact that there is basic difference between retirement under 
section 12(i) of the Act of 1974 and Section 4(b)(ii) of 

 
Service Appeal No.15 of 2015 & connected cases 
6
Government Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 1973, as 
retirement in terms of former provision is not a punishment and 
civil servant get all service benefits without any stigma whereas 
compulsory retirement under latter provision is a punishment.  
11. 
Regarding application of the Punjab Civil Servants 
(Directory Retirement from Service) Rules, 2021 (“the Directory 
Rules of 2021”), to the cases in hand, it is observed that these 
Rules were introduced through notification No. SOR-I(S&GAD)4-
11/2020 dated 16.02.2021.  As per the general rules of 
interpretation, these Rules would have a prospective effect for the 
reason that no expressed provision to the contrary is available 
therein. Consequently, the cases already pending and decided 
before enactment of aforesaid Rules would remain unaffected by 
the new legislation. It is observed with emphasis that statutes, 
notifications, 
executive 
and 
administrative 
orders 
operate 
prospectively unless retrospective operation was expressly 
provided therein. Notification which is duly published in the 
official gazette takes effect from the date on which it was 
published except otherwise provided in the notification itself. 
Disciplinary proceedings once initiated against a civil servant 
under a specific law shall be culminated under the same law and 
not under the law came into existence on the same subject 
subsequently. Reliance is placed upon Commissioner, Sindh 
Employees Social Securities Institution and another v. Messrs E.M. 
Oil Mills and Industries Ltd., S.I.T.E., Karachi and 2 others (2002 
SCMR  39), Muhammad Nawaz v. District and Sessions Judge 
and others (2003 SCMR 1720), Senior Member BOR and others v. 
Sardar Bakhsh Bhutta and another (2012 SCMR  864), 
Muhammad Tariq Badr and another v. National Bank of Pakistan 
and others (2013 SCMR  314), Controller General of Accounts v. 
Fazil Ahmad, DAO EC (C&W Division Hangu) and others (2021 
SCMR 800) and Muhammad Faheem Zafar v. Government of the 
Punjab through Accountant General, Punjab and 3 others [2022 
PLC (C.S.) 1156].

12. 
The argument of appellants that competent authority for 
civil servants in Grade-19 and above, in terms of Explanation to 
section 12 of the Act of 1974, is the Chief Minister, thus impugned 
retirement order has been passed by incompetent authority is 
totally misconceived.  The Punjab Judicial Service Rules, 1994 
regulate recruitment of the Punjab Judicial Service and prescribe 
conditions of service. Rule 3 provides that the service shall 
comprise the post of:- a) District and Sessions Judges; b) 
Additional District & Sessions Judges; c) Civil Judges-cum-
Judicial Magistrates. Rule 4 provides that appointments to the 
service shall be made by the High Court. Admittedly, appellants 
were appointed by the High Court, thus the competent authority to 
pass their retirement order in terms of section 12 of the Act of 
1974 is the High Court, which is comprised of the Chief Justice 
and Judges.  
13. 
The argument of appellant-Anwar Ali (Service Appeal 
No.27 of 2015) is that he had not secured twenty years of service 
(judicial service was 16 years, 04 months & 21 days), therefore, his 
retirement within contemplation of section 12 of the Act of 1974 
could not have been made. It was brought to our notice that before 
entering into judicial service, said appellant had more than seven 
years’ service at his credit in F.I.A., therefore, as per Rule 2.1 of 
the Punjab Civil Servants Pension Rules, 1955, the said period of 
service shall be added into twenty years of qualifying service for 
pension as contemplated under section 12(i) of the Act of 1974.  
14. 
So far as vires of Section 12 of the Act of 1974 is concerned, 
the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case reported as Muhammad 
Qadeer and 2 others v. Secretary, Defence Production Division, 
Government of Pakistan and others (2003 SCMR 1804), observed 
that present section 13 of the Civil Servants Act, 1973 was in line 
with the principles laid down by the Shariat Appellate Bench of 
Supreme Court in case reported as Pakistan and others v. Public at 
Large and others (PLD 1987 SC 304), thus, validity and 
proprietary of section 13 was not disputed. Undeniably, section 12 

 
Service Appeal No.15 of 2015 & connected cases 
8
of the Act of 1974 is pari materia to section 13 of the Civil 
Servants Act, 1973, therefore it is intra vires the Constitution.  
15. 
In view of the above, instant appeal and connected appeals 
in Category “A”, challenging Notification dated 02.06.2015 
regarding retirement under section 12 of the Act of 1974 are 
dismissed and consequently the appeals in Category “B” having 
become infructuous are disposed of accordingly.
