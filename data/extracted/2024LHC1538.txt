Sultan Tanvir Ahmad, J:– Through this 
appeal order dated 24.11.2023 has been challenged, 
whereby, application dated 30.10.2023 of the 
appellants filed under section 34 of the Arbitration 
Act, 1940 (the ‘application’), for staying the 
proceedings in suit titled “Mashhad Meat Industrial 
Complex versus Punjab Mashhad Meat Complex and 

                                             F.A. O. No.79041-2023 
 
 
 
     2
another” and directing the parties to pursue their 
remedies in terms of the arbitration clause, has been 
rejected. 
2.  
On 25.09.2023 the respondent / M/s 
Mashhad Meat Industrial Complex instituted a suit for 
recovery of Rs.4,550,862,285/- being the cost of 
various machineries and equipment, installation and 
training expenses, loss of profits, damages arising out 
of breach of commitments and rendition of accounts 
against the appellants with the averments that in the 
year 2010, appellant No. 2 and the respondent agreed 
to establish a modern slaughterhouse in Lahore; that 
in pursuance thereof the various arrangements were 
made, however, the disputes arose that resulted into 
filing of suit by the respondent for recovery of 
Rs.2,731,906,812/-; that during pendency of the suit 
meetings and deliberations took place in Mashhad, 
Iran and Lahore, Pakistan that resulted into a new 
arrangement in the shape of partnership deed dated 
07.01.2015 (the ‘partnership deed’) between the 
respondent and appellant No. 2; the earlier suit was 
withdrawn on 16.02.2015 but even after, the 
relationship could not improve, therefore, the 
respondent was forced to make a decision to withdraw 
investment from Punjab Mashhad Meat Complex / 
appellant No. 1 for which notice dated 29.04.2019 
was given in terms of clause 4.3.12 of the partnership 
deed offering to purchase the share of the respondent 
in the partnership deed, before selling or transferring 
of the share to a third party; upon which through letter 
dated 13.04.2022 the Punjab Agriculture & Meat 
Company Limited / appellant  No. 2 showed 

                                             F.A. O. No.79041-2023 
 
 
 
     3
willingness to purchase its share as per clause 4.3.12 
of the partnership deed but then after making excuses 
turned hostile towards the respondent. It is also 
pleaded in the suit that the entire venture was actually 
a ploy to acquire technical awareness and expertise 
from respondent as well as the appellants have failed 
to adhere the terms of the partnership deed; that the 
appellants have violated their duties and obligations in 
connection with the affairs of the partnership imposed 
under clause 4.2 of the partnership deed. Several 
other illegalities on the part of the appellants have 
also been alleged in the suit.  
3.  
On 30.10.2023 the application was instituted, 
which was contested by the respondent raising 
objections that the appellants by their conduct and by 
seeking an adjournment for filing written statement 
have taken steps in the proceedings, therefore, they 
have abandoned their right to invoke the arbitration 
clause in the partnership deed. The learned Special 
Court for commercial cases (the ‘Commercial Court’) 
vide its order dated 24.11.2023 concluded that the 
matter cannot be stayed under section 34 of the 
Arbitration Act, 1940 (the ‘Act’) and dismissed the 
application. Being aggrieved of the same, the present 
appeal has been preferred. 
4.  
Mr. Muhammad Naeem Sehgal, learned 
counsel for the appellants, has submitted that while 
passing the impugned order, the learned Commercial 
Court has failed to appreciate that the appellants have 
not taken any step in the proceedings rather the 
opportunities availed before the said learned Court 
were primarily for the purposes of filing an 

                                             F.A. O. No.79041-2023 
 
 
 
     4
application under section 34 of the Act; that the 
learned Commercial Court failed to apply judicial 
mind. It is further submitted that the learned 
Commercial Court has wrongly made reference to the 
previous suit which has no nexus with the alleged 
violation of the terms of the partnership deed and it is 
also ignored that clause 15 of the partnership deed 
clearly stipulates that the same constitutes the entire 
understanding between the parties with respect to the 
subject matter. It is further submitted that arbitration 
clause in the partnership deed covers the entire 
aspects of the disputes raised in the suit, thus, the 
learned Commercial Court fell to an error while 
rejecting the application. Learned counsel for the 
appellants has relied on various judgments in order to 
support his arguments. 
5.  
Conversely, Mr. Ijaz Ali Akbar Sabzwari, 
learned counsel for the respondent has submitted that 
even before filing the suit, several notices and 
reminders 
including 
notices 
dated 
29.04.2019, 
07.05.2019, 13.04.2022 and email dated 23.04.2022 
with respect to sale of the shares have been issued, 
however, initial inaction, then false excuses and 
finally the hostile attitude of the appellants are 
sufficient to show that they are not inclined to proceed 
with the arbitration. It is further argued that it is 
settled law that defender of a suit must show intention 
to invoke arbitration clause on the very first 
opportunity and without delay; that even seeking an 
adjournment to file a written statement amounts to a 
step in the proceedings of the suit, precluded the 

                                             F.A. O. No.79041-2023 
 
 
 
     5
defendant to insist upon arbitration clause, as already 
elaborated in several judgments. 
6.  
I have heard the arguments and record has 
been perused with the able assistance of learned 
counsel for the parties. 
7.  
The precise questions before this Court 
emerging out of the contest are if the appellants have 
taken such steps in the proceedings of the suit that 
preclude them from invoking the arbitration clause in 
the partnership deed or if the proceeding in the suit is 
required to be stayed under section 34 of the Act, in 
the circumstances of the case. For ready reference and 
convenience, the relevant provision of Act is 
reproduced as under: - 
 
34. Power to stay legal proceedings 
where there is an arbitration agreement.-- 
Where any party to an arbitration agreement 
or 
any 
person 
claiming 
under 
him 
commences any legal proceedings against 
any other party to the agreement or any 
person claiming under him in respect of any 
matter agreed to be referred, any party to 
such legal proceedings may, at any time 
before filing a written statement or taking 
any other steps in the proceedings, apply to 
the judicial authority before which the 
proceedings are pending to stay the 
proceedings: and if satisfied that there is no 
sufficient reason why the matter should not 
be 
referred 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
arbitration agreement and that the applicant 
was, at the time when the proceedings were 
commenced, and still remains, ready and 
willing to do all things necessary, to the 
proper conduct of the arbitration such 
authority may make an order staying the 
proceedings. 
 
 
 
               (Emphasis Supplied) 

                                             F.A. O. No.79041-2023 
 
 
 
     6
8.  
The above provides that a party to the legal 
proceedings can file an application to stay the 
proceedings against him before filing a written 
statement. Besides filing written statement, the above 
provision envisages that the application under section 
34 of the Act should be filed before taking any other 
steps in the proceedings. There appears to be a 
judicial consensus amongst the Courts that there has 
to be unequivocal and unambiguous intention on the 
part of the defendant to proceed with the suit and to 
give up the right to invoke the arbitration clause. An 
application seeking time to file written statement is 
normally taken as displaying such intention and an act 
or step in the proceedings to preclude a party to seek 
stay on the basis of arbitration clause, in the absence 
of anything contrary. In case titled “Pakistan 
International Airlines Corporation versus Messrs Pak 
Saaf Dry Cleaners” (PLD 1981 Supreme Court 553) 
the Supreme Court held that an application for 
adjournment providing time to file written statement 
prima facie is a step towards proceedings but subject 
to a chance to the applicant and burdening him to 
show as to why effect should not be given to this 
prima facie meaning or presumption. Here, I would 
like to reproduce the following extract from the said 
judgment: - 
“In my opinion, the true tests for 
determining whether an act is a step in 
the proceedings is not so much the 
question as to whether the party sought 
an adjournment for filing the written 
statement although of course that would 
be a satisfactory test in many cases but 
whether taking into consideration the 
contents of the application as well  as  all  

                                             F.A. O. No.79041-2023 
 
 
 
     7
the surrounding circumstances that led 
the party to make the application display 
an unequivocal intention to proceed with 
the suit, and to give up the right to have 
the matter disposed of by arbitration. An 
application of such nature, therefore, 
should prima facie be construed as a step 
in the proceedings within the meaning of 
section 34, and the whole burden should 
be upon the party to establish why effect 
should not be given to the prima facie 
meaning of the application.” 
 
 
 
 
   (Emphasis Supplied) 
9.  
In case titled “Rachappa Guruadappa, 
Bijapur versus Gurusiddappa Nuraniappa and 
others” (1990 MLD 1383) it has been held that a step 
taken in the suit, disentitling a party from obtaining 
stay of a proceeding, has to be a step that should 
display unequivocal intention to proceed with the suit 
and to abandon the benefit of arbitration agreement or 
the right to get the dispute resolved by the arbitration. 
It is also resolved that not every step in the 
proceedings would come in the way of enforcement of 
arbitration agreement and the step must be clear and 
unambiguous that manifest the intention to waive off 
the right under the arbitration agreement. It will be 
beneficial to reproduce paragraphs No. 11 and 12 of 
Rachappa Guruadappa, Bijapur case (supra): - 
   “11. In our opinion, that is a correct 
position in law as declared by this Court, 
and it is in consonance with the principles 
that have been followed under S. 4 of the 
English Arbitration Act, 1889. At page 
106 of the said report this Court observed 
that the "general words "taking any other 
steps in the proceedings' just follow the 
specific     expression    'filing    a   written  

                                             F.A. O. No.79041-2023 
 
 
 
     8
statement ‘and both are used for 
achieving the same purpose". Hence, this 
Court was of the opinion that the latter 
expression must be construed ejusdem 
generis with the specific expression just 
preceding to bring out the ambit of the 
latter. The expression 'written statement' 
is 
a 
term 
of 
specific 
connotation 
ordinarily signifying a reply to the plaint 
filed by the plaintiff. The expression 
'taking any other steps in the proceedings' 
does not mean that every step in the 
proceedings would come in the way of 
enforcement of the arbitration agreement. 
The step must be such as would clearly 
and unambiguously manifest the intention 
to waive the benefit of arbitration 
agreement. 
12. From the order-sheet in this case and 
as noted by the learned trial Judge, it 
appears that the counsel appearing for 
the petitioner had sought adjournment 
"specifically for filing written statement” 
and obtained time for more than one 
occasion for such purpose. It was not only 
the time taken to consider whether written 
statement should be filed as a defence to 
the plaint to enter into an arena of 
controversy, but it was time taken to have 
the matter decided by the suit.”

10.  
In case titled “Dunichand Sons and Co. v. 
Fort Gloster Industries Ltd.” (A.I.R. 1962 Calcutta 
541 (V 49 C 116), test was laid down to determine    
if a particular act or a step in the proceedings displays 
requisite intention to proceed with the suit. Just 
appearance in a suit without disclosing a clear 
intention to discard the contractual right to get a 
matter 
resolved 
through 
arbitration 
has 
been 
categorized as not a step in the proceedings for the 
given purpose. In case titled “Badsha Meah Sowdagar 
versus  Nurul Haq and others” (PLD 1967 Dacca 

                                             F.A. O. No.79041-2023

250), where a defendant, of suit for dissolution of 
partnership and for accounts, moved an application 
with the prayer for time to file objection to an 
application for appointment of receiver and then 
instead filed an application under section 34 of the 
Act, learned Division Bench of Dacca High Court 
held that merely the prayer to file an objection to an 
application for appointment of receiver, under the 
given circumstances, does not amount to acquaintance 
in the proceedings, therefore, was not very material so 
that the party could be excluded to file an application 
for stay.  
11.  
In case titled “Messrs Pakistan Associates 
Construction Ltd. versus  WAPDA and another” 
(1989 MLD 203) a formal order was passed by the 
learned Court for filing written statement, after an 
adjournment was sought by the defendant. This Court 
reached to the decision that a routine adjournment 
may not necessarily ascribe to be a step in the 
proceedings, in the absence of any written application 
for that precise purpose. No intention to waive off the 
right to get the matter resolved through arbitration 
was inferred by the Court. It is appropriate to 
reproduce the following extract from Messrs Pakistan 
Associates Construction Ltd. case (supra): - 
“...Reliance was placed on Board of 
Intermediate and Secondary Education, 
Sargodha and another v. Messrs Akhtar 
Brothers (1981 CLC 221) for the view that 
even an oral request for adjournment 
amounted to a step in aid of proceedings and 
submission to the jurisdiction of the Civil 
Court. The record does not support this 
contention inasmuch as there was no request 
proceeding 
from 
the 
respondents 
for 

                                             F.A. O. No.79041-2023 
 
 
 
     10
adjournment. It appeared to have been an 
order passed in the routine without showing 
that the adjournment was being granted on 
a pointed request made by the respondents 
in that behalf. The rule on the point is more 
succinctly stated in Pakistan International 
Airlines Corporation v. Messrs Pak Saaf 
Dry Cleaners (P L D 1981 SC 553 (564)) 
where a definite test was laid down to see if 
the intention really was to submit to the 
jurisdiction of the Civil Court and not abide 
by the Arbitration clause. Indeed in that 
case much turned upon the application 
made for adjournment and it was held that 
there was no indication on the part of the 
defendants to acquiesce in the proceedings 
before the Civil Court. In this case, as 
already remarked, there was no such 
application so as to determine the true intent 
of the respondents to take part in the suit by 
filing a written statement. The adjournment 
granted in routine may not be necessarily 
ascribed to a sort of oral request of the 
respondents. In the absence of any written 
application for that purpose, it is not easy to 
infer against the respondents. In fact there 
are a few other cases like Island Textile Mills 
Ltd., Karachi v. V./o Techno-expert and 
another (1979 CLC 307) and Province of 
Punjab through Secretary to Government of 
Punjab, 
Communication 
& 
Works 
Department, Lahore and 4 others v Ehsan 
Fazal & Company, Lahore through Partner 
(1986 CLC 2800) wherein even applications 
for temporary injunction etc. etc. were held 
not to be steps in aid of the proceedings in 
the suit. Acting upon that analogy, one may 
well observe that in the case in hand where 
no application either for adjournment or for 
temporary injunction or for any other 
ancillary relief was made, the respondents 
did not disclose an intractable intention to 
file written statement...”

12.  
Returning to the facts of the case. The 
respondent filed the suit on 25.09.2023 when notices 

                                             F.A. O. No.79041-2023

were issued to the appellants and the case was fixed 
for 28.09.2023 but till then the summons were not 
received back either served or unserved. Resultantly, 
this process was repeated for 11.10.2023 when for the 
first time the appellant-side entered appearance and 
filed power of attorney. The order of the said date 
reflects that only copies of the suit were handed over 
to the learned counsel of the appellants and at the 
same time direction was issued by the learned 
Commercial Court to the respondent / plaintiff to 
provide all the documents appended with the suit. The 
said order reads as follows: - 
''

13. 
On the next date of hearing, the copies of 
those documents which were directed to be given to 
the appellants were handed over. At the same time a 
request of the appellants has been recorded for an 
adjournment to file written statement. Since both sides 
have raised dispute by giving different meanings to 
this particular order, therefore, I would like to 
reproduce order dated 17.10.2023 that reads as 
under:- 
 
“ORDER 
 
17.10.2023 
 
Present  Learned counsels for the parties.
 Copies of annexures have been 

                                             F.A. O. No.79041-2023 
 
 
 
     12
received by the representative of 
defendants. 
As 
per 
request, 
adjourned for submission of written 
statement 
written 
reply 
of 
application u/o 40 rule 1 r/w Sec. 
94 & 151 CPC for 30.10.2023.” 
 
14.  
 Mr. Muhammad Naeem Sehgal, learned 
counsel for the appellants, has clarified that on the 
said date of hearing, just the copies of the annexures 
were received and no particular request to file written 
statement was made. Learned counsel for the 
appellants has contended that this request was 
recorded as a routine matter. He has also explained 
that signatures on the margin of the order-sheet were 
given in order to confirm that the annexures have 
been received and when the case was fixed on 
30.10.2023 an application under section 34 of the Act 
was moved. Mr. Ijaz Ali Akbar Sabzwari, learned 
counsel for the respondent, has submitted that the 
above is sufficient to be construed as a step towards 
proceedings.  
15. 
Admittedly, till 17.10.2023 the appellants 
were not even handed over the entire attachments of 
the suit, in terms of the previous direction dated 
11.10.2023. On the crucial date, much focused by the 
learned counsel for the respondent, the appellants 
were not in possession of the entire material enabling 
them to form an opinion or to make a desire to file the 
written statement and / or to waive off the right of 
arbitration. The appellants after having an opportunity 
to go through the entire documents have not wasted 
any time and instituted the application on the very 
next 
date 
of 
hearing. 
Though 
applications         

                                             F.A. O. No.79041-2023 
 
 
 
     13
seeking time to file written statement in some cases 
are taken as a requisite intention to waive off a right 
to get the causes resolved through arbitration but as 
already discussed above, the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan 
in 
Pakistan 
International 
Airlines 
Corporation case (supra) has not taken such step as 
conclusive proof of this intention rather as prima facie 
indication only and burdening the one making request 
to stay to show otherwise. 
16.  
The request for adjournment for submission 
of written statement is recorded by the learned 
Commercial Court on the day when the said learned 
Court is also confirming that the entire attachments to 
the suit were not available with the appellants and the 
same were handed over to them on the given day, 
therefore, I am of the opinion that the learned 
Commercial Court has wrongly construed the 
intention of the appellants to discard their right to 
invoke arbitration clause available in the partnership 
deed. The facts, circumstances of the case and 
explanation given by the appellant are so that any 
initial presumption arising against the appellants 
stands dislodged. 
17.  
Mr. Ijaz Ali Akbar Sabzwari has next 
submitted that arbitration clause does not cover the 
matter in dispute. In case titled “POSCO International 
Corporation through Authorised Officer versus 
Rikans International through Managing Partner / 
Director and 4 others” (PLD 2023 Lahore 116) it 
has been observed that an arbitration agreement does 
not only impose ‘positive’ obligation upon the parties 
to proceed with the disputes but also creates negative 

                                             F.A. O. No.79041-2023 
 
 
 
     14
undertaking for the parties which obligates them not 
to  bring  any claim within the arbitration agreement’s 
scope in a forum other than arbitration. Similar view 
was adopted by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in case 
titled “S. M. Hashim Hussain versus  Pakistan 
Defence Officer’s Housing Authority” (2005 SCMR 
1782). Mr. Sabzwari though has adopted the above 
stated stance but I have not found that his stance has 
any support from the record. The clause in question 
(clause 6 of the partnership deed) reads that in case of 
any dispute or difference arising between the parties 
in connection with the partnership deed or the 
transaction contemplated therein, the dispute is to be 
referred to the arbitration as provided in clause 4.3.17 
and the venue of the arbitration is settled to be the city 
of Lahore. Clause 4.3 of the partnership deed relates 
to the management of the partnership. The suit, 
besides other, contains allegation of mismanagement. 
This very clause (more particularly sub-clauses 4.3.12 
and 4.3.13) also provides for the mechanism if one of 
the parties to the partnership desires to sell or assign 
or withdraw from its share in the partnership. Sub-
clause 4.3.17 which is being referred in dispute 
resolution / arbitration clause provides that in case of 
any deadlock in mutual consultation process between 
the parties, the matter is to be referred to a committee 
comprising of the Secretary Livestock & Dairy 
Development Department Punjab and Counsel 
General of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Lahore, for 
amicable 
resolution. 
Learned counsel for the 
respondent has failed to convince if there is any issue 
between the parties that is not capable of being 

                                             F.A. O. No.79041-2023 
 
 
 
     15
handled or resolved by the arbitrators or if it is not 
covered under clause 6 i.e. the arbitration clause of 
the partnership deed. 
18. 
The learned Commercial Court somehow 
observed that in some previous suit the application 
under section 34 of the Act was not filed. The learned 
Court also referred to certain letters or emails by the 
respondent-side, 
which 
were 
written 
prior 
to 
institution of the suit. The referred communication, 
prior to institution of the suit has no bearing, as 
section 34 of the Act clearly provides that an 
application for stay can be instituted at any time after 
commencement of legal proceedings. Similarly, the 
suit being relied for ascertaining the intention to 
waive off the right of arbitration relates to the period 
prior to the partnership deed which now requires the 
disputes to be resolved through arbitration. The said 
suit of the respondent pertains to the year 2014 which 
was disposed of on 16.02.2015 on the basis of the 
partnership deed which was formally executed on 
07.01.2015, thus, the present suit cannot be termed as 
a continuation of the earlier suit, for the purposes of 
ascertaining the situation in hand, as mistakenly has 
been observed by the learned Commercial Court. The
