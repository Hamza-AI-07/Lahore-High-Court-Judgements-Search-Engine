2. 
In the area of water conservation, the significant 
measures taken by the Commission are regarding 
construction of 200 ablution water tanks in Mosques as well 
as construction of Recharge wells which are over 100 in 
number.  More Recharge wells are being constructed which 
will continue during the next year.  The construction of 
rainwater storage tanks at Lawrence Garden and Sheranwala 
Gate, Lahore have been completed.  Likewise, on the 

W.P No.227807 of 2018 
 
6
directions of this Court the Commission has ensured the 
installation of Effluent Treatment Plants in different 
industries located in Punjab including but not limited to 
sugar mills, taxtile units and Kasur tanneries.   As a result, 
there has been closure of injection pits in at least 400 
industries.  Likewise, installation of filtration / reverse 
osmosis plants to deal with arsenic contamination in the 
villages of Kasur and Sahiwal has been completed on the 
directions of this Court and under the supervision of the 
Commission.  In order to discourage extraction of 
groundwater for irrigation of parks and cleaning of roads, 
initiative was taken for opening non-operational canal 
outlets / Moghas in Lahore and thereby promoting use of 
surface water.  Amendments have been made in the LDA’s 
Regulations for grey-water recycling.  Frequent liaison has 
been established with Central Business District for 
promotion and incorporation of eco-friendly measures in the 
projects of CBD. 
Environment: 
3. 
Similarly, in the field of environment steps have been 
taken which include conversion of 100% brick kilns in 
Punjab to zig-zag technology.  In a bid to reduce pollution 
generally and smog in winter provision and handing over of 
several new buses to public colleges/ universities has taken 
place on the specific directions of this Court.  Initiatives 
have started and instruction gone out to public and private 
educational institutions for purchase of school buses for at 
least 50% of students.  Mandatory enforcement of M-Tag on 
motorways was ordered by this Court to prevent vehicular 
congestion and excessive emission.  Steps have been taken 

W.P No.227807 of 2018 
 
7
on the directions of this Court to promote cycling and E-
Bikes by the government staff.  Extensive tree-plantation / 
urban forestation has been undertaken by the Parks & 
Horticulture Authority (PHA) which includes plantation of 
Miyawaki forest at different places in Lahore.  Instructions 
were issued to all Deputy Commissioners in Punjab for 
control of stubble burning which is one of the contributors to 
smog during the winter season.  In this regard, the office of 
the Commissioner, Lahore played a lead role. Promulgation 
of Smog Rules, 2023 also took place during the year which 
envisage stringent measures regarding industrial units 
contributing to spike in smog and air pollution.  On the 
directions of this Court smog was declared as a calamity and 
PDMA was assigned a lead role which set up a control room 
for enforcement of remedial measures to control smog.   
4. 
It is clear from the narration above that substantial and 
practical steps have been taken to control air pollution and to 
preserve groundwater.  During the winter season these steps 
largely contributed to lowering AQI at different places in 
Lahore and thereby smog was controlled which had initially 
assumed dangerous proportions. This is an illustration of 
judicial review in action, and enforcement of climate justice. 
These actions are beyond mere judgements which adorn law 
journals and fail to address in actual terms, the climate chaos 
which surrounds us. It is, in essence, a case of continuing 
mandamus or supervisory jurisdiction where orders of this 
Court are enforced by a Commission set up to compel 
implementation. The departments in turn, come back with 
reports of compliance and further orders are issued for 

W.P No.227807 of 2018 
 
8
complete climate justice and to protect fundamental rights of 
persons. This is a unique tool being employed by this Court 
which has yielded substantial results. 
5. 
The Members of the Commission submitted that 
Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) was still 
using groundwater for sprinkling on roads.  It is directed and 
this direction shall be conveyed not only by the Members of 
the Commission but also by the learned A.A.G that LWMC 
shall not use groundwater for the purpose of sprinkling on 
the roads but shall use surface water or water from ablution 
tanks.  In case this is found to be done, WASA will be held 
responsible and the tube-well being operated by WASA will 
be sealed.  
6. 
It has also been informed that there are multiple 
violations by industrial units despite sealing orders and 
imposition of fines.  It is directed that LESCO shall cut off 
electricity supply to these units on the recommendations of 
the Members of the Commission if they find in a particular 
case that the industrial unit in question is not complying 
with the directions and is in breach of its legal obligations.  
This order shall be conveyed to M.D LESCO by the learned 
D.A.G present on Court’s call.  
Tree Plantation: 
7. 
An order has already been passed restraining cutting of 
trees in and around Lahore. Any violation of the order has 
been visited by prompt action and strict penalty. The 
regulatory authorities tasked with the development of 
Lahore and its planning have initiated steps for plantation of 
miyawaki forests in Lahore at different locations identified 
by LDA and PHA. One such forest under the corporate 

W.P No.227807 of 2018 
 
9
social responsibility programme has been planted by Nishat 
Group at Johar Town. The initiatives set in motion by this 
Court includes planation of rooftop gardening and trees in 
public colleges and schools. This movement has gained 
traction during the last few months and by now a total 
number of 56632 rooftop plants and trees have been planted 
at different colleges and schools. The tree plantations drive 
and rooftop gardening is also being spread to private schools 
and commercial buildings to stunt the effect of heat during 
summers. This would not have been possible without the 
selfless and untiring efforts of the members of the 
Commission who have devoted their energies to this 
monumental task. The counsels of different departments and 
regulatory authorities have also come on board as friends of 
the Court and the environment to lend a hand in this 
enterprise. 
C.M.No.74 of 2023 
8. 
The notices are accepted by learned Members of the 
Water & Environment Commission who shall look into the 
matter and inform this Court on the next date of hearing.
