At the heart of the concept of the rule of law is the idea that society is governed 
by law. Parliament exists primarily in order to make laws for society in this 
country. Democratic procedures exist primarily in order to ensure that the 
Parliament which makes those laws includes Members of Parliament who are 
chosen by the people of this country and are accountable to them. Courts exist 
in order to ensure that the laws made by Parliament, and the common law 
created by the courts themselves, are applied and enforced. That role includes 
ensuring that the executive branch of government carries out its functions in 
accordance with the law. In order for the courts to perform that role, people 
must in principle have unimpeded access to them. Without such access, laws 
are liable to become a dead letter, the work done by Parliament may be 
rendered nugatory, and the democratic election of Members of Parliament may 
become a meaningless charade. That is why the courts do not merely provide a 
public service like any other.

JAWAD HASSAN, J. This judgment will decide above 
numbered 
petitions 
(the 
“consolidated 
petitions”), 
whereby 
interpretation of time bound/time specific constitutional provisions of 
the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the 
“Constitution”) read with relevant provisions of the Elections Act, 
2017 (the “Act”) has been sought by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (the 
“PTI”) through its Secretary General Asad Umar, Munir Ahmad, 
Zaman Khan Vardag and Sabir Raza Gill (the “Petitioners”) to issue 
writ of mandamus in terms of Article 199 of the “Constitution” 
directing the Respondents to announce date of holding elections of 
Provincial Assembly, Punjab (the “date of election”) within ninety 
(90) days as mandated by the “Constitution” and the relevant 
provisions of the “Act”. The prayer made in the “consolidated 
petitions” reads as under:- 
  
“W.P.No.5851 of 2023 
Direct Respondent to immediately announce the date of election for the 
Provincial Assembly of the Punjab so as to ensure that the election is held 
not later than ninety days of dissolution of Assembly. 
 
  
W.P.No.6118 of 2023 
In view of the aforementioned facts and peculiar circumstances, it is, therefore, 
humbly prayed that the Writ Petition at hand may very kindly be accepted 
and necessary orders may kindly be issued the Respondent to 
No.1/Governor to immediately announce the date of election for the 
Provincial Assembly of the Punjab as directed under Article 105, read with 
224 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 so as to 
enforce Article 218(3) ibid, so that the Election is held not later than ninety 
days of dissolution of the Assembly, in the interest of public, democratic 
norms, justice, equity and fair play. 
It is further prayed that in view of the constant violations of the 
Governor/Respondent No.1 of his Constitutional Mandate, his Oath as 
well as the continuous violations of Articles 4 & 5, 105, 218(3) and 224 
of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, it is requested 
that the President of Pakistan may kindly be directed to act in accordance 
with Article 101(3) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973, so as to remove the same, of course, in order to fulfil the constitutional 
mandate. 
 
Writ Petition No.6093 of 2023 

Writ Petition No.5851of 2023                
 
   4 
UNDER THE ABOVEMENTIONED CIRCUMSTANCES, it 
is respectfully prayed that an appropriate writ may be issued by declaring that 
after dissolution of a Provincial Assembly, the delay on the part of the 
Governor for appointing an actual date for holding of a General election to 
the Assembly is violative of Articles 105(3) and 5(2) of the Constitution of 
Pakistan. 
It is further prayed that a direction may be issued to the Governor of Punjab 
to appoint an actual date, not later than 90 days from the date of dissolution 
for holding of a general election to a Provincial Assembly of Punjab. 
 
Writ Petition No.6119 of 2023 
In view of the foregoing, it is most respectfully prayed that this Hon’ble Court 
may be pleased to direct Respondent to immediately announce the date of 
election for the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab so as to ensure that the 
election is held not later than ninety days of dissolution of the Assembly” 
 
2. 
The common prayer in the “consolidated petitions” revolves 
around the announcement of “date of election” by the Respondents. 
Pertinently, on the issue of time specific/time bound provision of a 
Statue/Act, this Court has already rendered a detailed judgment 
reported in “SHAHEEN MERCHANT Versus FEDERATION OF 
PAKISTAN etc” (2021 PTD 2126 Lahore) in which this Court has 
developed the doctrine of time bound legislation with its mandate to 
decide the matter as per time frame given under a statute while 
discussing the anatomy of authority/regulator, jurisprudential 
anthology regarding the duty of the State to provide expeditious 
justice under Article 37-D of the “Constitution” while referring the 
judgments of Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan and the legal 
anthropology of time frame, pathology regarding the time specific 
tribunal with time bound mandate to decide the matter under the law. 
This Court first time developed the principles of time frame by relying  
quote of Justice Warren E. Burger, Chief Justice of United States 
which reads as: 
A sense of confidence in the courts is essential to 
maintain the fabric of ordered liberty for a free people 
and three things could destroy that confidence and do 
incalculable damage to society: (i) that people come to 
believe that inefficiency and delay will drain even a 
just judgment of its value; (ii) that people who have 
long been exploited in the smaller transactions of 

Writ Petition No.5851of 2023                
 
   5 
daily life come to believe that courts cannot vindicate 
their legal rights from fraud and over-reaching; (iii) 
that people come to believe the law – in the larger 
sense – cannot fulfill its primary function to protect 
them and their families in their homes, at their work, 
and on the public streets quotation. 
 
  
In the aforesaid judgment, the Court specifically stated that 
under Article 37-D of the “Constitution” the State is duty bound to 
give the expeditious justice.  
  
CONTEXT OF THE CASE 
3. 
In terms of Article 112(1) of the “Constitution”, the then 
Chief Minister of Punjab, Ch. Pervaiz Elahi on 12.01.2023 advised 
the Governor of Punjab to dissolve Provincial Assembly. The 
Governor of Punjab in its letter dated 14.01.2023 declared that the 
Provincial Assembly Punjab and the Cabinet stood dissolved after 
forty-eight hours at 22:10 hours and assured his availability for 
discharging his constitutional obligations. The incumbent Speaker of 
the Punjab Assembly Muhammad Sibtain Khan had requested the 
Governor of Punjab on 20.01.2023 to appoint the “date of election”. 
Another request for the same purpose was also made by the “ECP” to 
Principal Secretary to the Governor of the Punjab on 24.01.2023, in 
reply thereto, the Principal Secretary to the Governor of Punjab has 
mentioned that he has been directed to state, in the aforenoted context, 
and to ask the “ECP” to note that the Provincial Assembly of Punjab 
stood dissolved in terms of clause(1) of Article 112 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 by efflux of 
time stipulated therein and not by the order of the Governor of the 
Punjab. Therefore, clause (3) of Article 105 of the Constitution of the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 does not apply in this situation. 
Instead, the election process to now take place in accordance with 
Article 224 read with clause (3) of Article 218 of the Constitution of 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the applicable provisions of the 
Elections Act, 2017, hence this petition.

PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COURT. 
  
On 30.01.2023, when the titled petition first time brought 
before the Court, it was only carrying documents appended therewith 
(Annex-A to Annex-D, Pages 8 to 13). In all petitions, the prayer of 
the Petitioners circumambulates for issuance of directions to the 
Respondents to announce the “date of election” within the time frame 
provided in the “Constitution” and the “Act”.   
First Date of Hearing (30.01.2023) 
4. 
Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, ASC during course of 
hearing, had referred to a letter dated 24.01.2023 issued by the 
“ECP” to Principal Secretary to the Governor of the Punjab in terms 
of Article 224 of the “Constitution” read with Section 57(2) of the 
“Act” regarding announcing the “date of election” and he, on 
confrontation, has made the “ECP” as the Respondent No.2 in this 
petition. Mr. Asad Umar concurrently highlighted the right of 
democracy and political justice by relying the judgment of this Court 
in the case of “HAFEEZ UR REHMAN CH Versus FEDERATION OF 
PAKISTAN etc” (2022 MLD 2006). The Court after hearing the 
arguments, admitted the petitions and issued notices to the Attorney 
General for Pakistan as well as Advocate General Punjab in terms of 
Order XXVII-A of the Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908), sought 
replies.   
  
Second Date of Hearing (03.02.2023) 
5. 
Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, ASC remained consistent on 
focal point viz the mandate of the Governor of Punjab to announce the 
“date of election” within constitutional time frame of ninety days 
after dissolution of Provincial Assembly and relied on certain Articles 
of 
the 
“Constitution” 
and 
non-compliance 
thereof 
entails 
constitutional breach by referring “FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN 
Versus MUHAMMAD SAIFULLAH KHAN” (PLD 1989 SC 166) 
(Full Bench), “ELECTION COMMISSION OF PAKISTAN Versus 
JAVAID HASHMI” (PLD 1989 SC 396), “MUHAMMAD SHARIF 

Writ Petition No.5851of 2023                
 
   7 
Versus FEDERATION OF PAKSITAN” (PLD 1988 Lahore 725) 
(Full Bench) and “Rao NAEEM SARFARAZ Versus ELECTION 
COMMISSION 
OF 
PAKISTAN 
through 
Chief 
Election 
Commissioner” (PLD 2013 Lahore 675).  Mr. Asad Umar referred 
“Curate’s Egg” principle and stated that he sees the role of ECP some 
good as it had announced dates of bye-elections throughout the 
Country but some bad as the “ECP” is not giving the “date of 
election” in his case. The Court also directed the Respondents to file 
reply to this petition.  
  
Third Date of Hearing (09.02.2023) 
6. 
Written statement on behalf of the Governor of Punjab was 
submitted by Mr. Muhammad Shahzad Shaukat, ASC on 08.02.2023 
in W.P.No.6118 of 2023. The case was argued at length by Senator 
Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, ASC who referred Article 220 of the 
“Constitution” and also relied on the judgment of Hon’ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan titled “CH. PERVAIZ ELAHI Versus DEPUTY 
SPEAKER, PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY OF PUNJAB, LAHORE and 
others” (PLD 2022 SC 678) and sought writ of mandamus against the 
Respondents for announcing the “date of election”. Mr. Shezada 
Mazhar, ASC appeared on behalf of the “ECP” and sought time to 
file reply. While Mr. Muhammad Shahzad Shaukat, ASC for the 
Governor of Punjab was on adjournment due to his preoccupation 
before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan. The case was 
adjourned to 10.02.2023. 
  
Fourth Date of Hearing (10.02.2023) 
7. 
Reply was filed by Mr. Shezada Mazhar, ASC on behalf of the 
“ECP” and arguments were concluded by learned counsel for the 
parties. Chief Secretary Punjab and Inspector General of Police 
appeared and made their statements before the Court with reference to 
Article 220 of the “Constitution” and stated that they will fully 
comply with the directions of the “ECP”.  
8. 
Before proceedings further, it would be advantageous to add 
that reply on behalf of Governor of Punjab was filed only in 

Writ Petition No.5851of 2023                
 
   8 
W.P.No.6118 of 2023 whereas reply on behalf of the “ECP” was 
only filed in W.P.No.5851 of 2023. Since the common question in the 
“consolidated petitions” with regard to “date of election” is involved 
therefore, the replies filed by the Respondents would be treated as 
replies in the “consolidated petitions” in the light of judgment 
reported in “DR. MUHAMMAD NASIM JAVED Versus LAHORE 
CANTONMENT HOUSING SOCIETY LTD, THROUGH THE 
SECRETARY FORTRESS STADIUM LAHORE CANTT. and 2 
others” (PLD 1983 Lahore 552) wherein it was held that “where a 
number of writ petitions are being heard together, written statement 
filed by respondents in one of such writ petition can also be treated as 
written statement in the other writ petitions being heard together and 
therefore no prejudice will be caused to such party by not filing of 
separate written statements in each case”. 
  
PETITIONERS SUBMISSIONS 
9. 
Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, ASC inter alia argues that 
after dissolving the Provincial Assembly by the Governor of Punjab  
in terms of Article 112(1) of the “Constitution”, ninety days’ time has 
been provided for announcement of “date of election” by the 
Governor of Punjab which, if not announced, cannot be left open for 
an indefinite period and under the law, the same can be announced 
either by the “ECP” or the President of Pakistan, as the case may be. 
In order to strengthen this argument, he has relied on paragraph No.16 
of the judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in case titled 
“CH. PERVAIZ ELAHI Versus DEPUTY SPEAKER, PROVINCIAL 
ASSEMBLY OF PUNJAB, LAHORE and others” (PLD 2022 SC 
678); that the Petitioners are seeking writ of mandamus to the 
“Respondents” to announce the “date of election” with reference to 
Articles 112, 105, 218 and 219 of the “Constitution”; Mr. Uzair 
Karamat Bhandari, ASC states that Articles 112 and 105 of the 
“Constitution” have to be read together as the Governor of Punjab 
though appointed caretaker government as per mandate of Article 
105(3)(b) yet without announcing the “date of election” of dissolved 

Writ Petition No.5851of 2023                
 
   9 
Assembly 
under 
Article 
103(3)(a) 
of 
the 
“Constitution”;  
Mr. Mohammad Azhar Siddique, ASC states that Article 218(3) of the 
“Constitution” casts a duty upon the “ECP” to organize and conduct 
the election of the assemblies as defined under Section 2(iv) of the 
“Act” and to make such arrangements as are necessary to ensure the 
conduct of election honestly, justly, fairly and in accordance with law 
but in the case in hand, the “ECP” has shown his readiness to conduct 
the election and has made request to the Governor of Punjab to 
appoint a date under Article 224(2) of the “Constitution” read with 
Section 57(2) of the “Act” between 9th April, 2023 to 13th April, 2013 
as evident from letter dated 24.01.2023 but this power has not been 
exercised by the Governor of Punjab; that under Article 5 of the 
“Constitution”, the Governor of Punjab is bound to obey the 
“Constitution” and law and the law in the case is the ”Act” and the 
judgments of the apex Court; lastly he has put much emphasis on the 
preamble of the “Constitution” in the light of judgment of this Court 
passed in the case of “JAMSHED IQBAL CHEEMA Versus THE 
ELECTION APPELLATE TRIBUNAL and 19 others” (2022 CLC 
463).   
 
  
RESPONDENTS SUBMISSION 
  
Reply on behalf of Governor of Punjab  
 
10. 
Mr. Mohammad Shahzad Shaukat, ASC filed reply and took 
preliminary objection qua maintainability of the “consolidated 
petitions” on the touchstone of Article 248 of the “Constitution”. It 
has further been objected that the “consolidated petitions” have been 
filed in utter disregard to the provisions of Articles 105, 112, 218 and 
219 of the “Constitution”.  
Reply on behalf of the “ECP”  
 
11. 
Mr. Shezada Mazhar, ASC filed reply and took preliminary 
objection qua maintainability of the “consolidated petitions” on the 
touchstone of Article 218(1), 224, 58(1), 48(5), 112(1) of the 
“Constitution”. It has further been objected that under the 

Writ Petition No.5851of 2023                
 
   10 
“Constitution” and the “Act” there is no provision which requires the 
“ECP” to give date of election.  
  
DETERMINATION BY THE COURT   
12. 
From the prayer made in the “consolidated petitions”, the 
anchor point is whether writ of mandamus can be issued to either of 
the Respondents to announce the “date of election” under Article 199 
of the “Constitution”. Without any shadow of doubt, 90 days’ time is 
mandated in the “Constitution” for fixing/announcing the “date of 
election” of Provincial Assembly after its dissolution in terms of 
Article 105 and time frame provided under Articles 112 and 224(2) of 
the “Constitution”. Aptly, the constitutional duties of the Governor of 
Punjab being the Head of the Province are mentioned under Part-IV, 
Chapter-1 of the “Constitution” according to which the Governor is 
appointed by the President on the advise of the Prime Minister and 
holds the office at the pleasure of the President. Under this Part, the 
Governor performs his functions on the advice of the Chief Minister 
or the Cabinet and this Part specifically deals with his role as the 
Governor for the Province as per Article 101 of the “Constitution” 
being the head of Province which is equal to the President of the 
Pakistan under Part-III, Chapter-1, but the President has the term of 
office under Article 44 for five years. The President also acts on the 
advice of the Cabinet under Article 41 which is similar to Article 105 
of the “Constitution” but the duty/obligation of the Governor are 
subject to constitution because Article 105 of the “Constitution” 
starts with subject to constitution, and the provisions invoked by “the 
Petitioners” under Article of 105(3) where the governor dissolve the 
Provincial Assembly but he has to first give a date of holding general 
elections and then to appoint caretaker government. It is evident from 
the correspondence between the parties and the stance taken by the 
Governor of Punjab and letter of the President of Pakistan to the 
Governor clearly manifests that conduct of general election but who 
has to do it is not answered in Article 224 of the “Constitution” for 
holding elections within 90 days. It is quite clear that Article 224 of 

Writ Petition No.5851of 2023                
 
   11 
the “Constitution” falls under Part-VIII, Chapter 2 which deals with 
electoral laws and conduct of elections whereas Part VIII Chapter 1 
deals with the Chief Election Commission and Election Commissions 
with their mandate. Article 224(2) of the “Constitution” deals with 
the time of election but did not specific which authority as it falls 
under Chapter 2 of Part VIII which deals with electoral laws and 
conduct of election. It has been seen that Chapter 2 deals with conduct 
of election if it is read with Chapter 5 of the “Act”, which deals with 
the election of the Assemblies read with Chapter 5 of the Elections 
Rules, 2017.  
13. 
Perusal of Article 105 of the “Constitution” makes it quite 
clear that it covers two eventualities; the first eventuality deals with 
the situation where on the advice of the Chief Minister, the Governor 
exercises his constitutional power to dissolve the assembly while 
second eventuality deals with a situation where on such advice by the 
Chief Minister, he abstains from exercising his constitutional powers 
and the assembly stands dissolved by operation of law. In the first 
eventuality, where the Governor uses his constitutional powers to 
dissolve the assembly, he is clearly bound under Article 105(3)(a) to 
appoint a date not later than ninety days from the date of dissolution, 
for the holding of general elections to the Assembly but Article 105 is 
silent and does not clearly specify as to who is the authority to declare 
the date of election in the above-mentioned second eventuality.  
14. 
On the other hand, careful perusal of Article 112 of the 
“Constitution” also shows that the said two eventualities are duly 
separated by insertion of semi-colon, separating the eventuality when 
the Governor so exercises his constitutional powers to dissolve the 
assembly, from the eventuality when it stands dissolved by the 
operation of law. Now question arises, at the cost of repetition, that 
none of the parties have taken the stance against Article 224(2) of the 
Constitution that general election is required to be held within 90 days 
therefore, the actual point of dispute is regarding the authority under 
the given circumstances who is to declare the date of such election. 

Writ Petition No.5851of 2023                
 
   12 
This is because Article 224(2) also does not specifically mentions the 
authority who is constitutionally bound to declare the date of election 
of the Provincial Assembly in such eventuality. To resolve this 
controversy, while keeping in view the stance of the Governor of 
Punjab in his correspondence letter dated 01.02.2023, mentioned 
supra and the letter dated 08.02.2023 of the President of Pakistan 
addressed to the Chief Election Commissioner, it is necessary to look 
into the nature, scope, constitutional mandate and constitutional 
responsibility of the “ECP”. It is not out of place to mention here that 
the Governor vide his letter 01.02.2023 addressed to the Ex-
Parliamentary Leader of “PTI”, has reaffirmed that he will discharge 
his responsibilities and duties in line with the “Constitution” and law 
as and when required.   
15. 
On the other hand, perusal of Part-VIII of the “Constitution” 
shows that the Constitution in Articles 213 to 226 contained in 
Chapters 1 and 2 of the said Part, defines and elaborates the nature, 
scope, powers and purposes of the “ECP”. Article 218(3) of the 
“Constitution” provides that “It shall be the duty of the Election 
Commission to organize and conduct the election and to make such 
arrangements as are necessary to ensure that the election is 
conducted honestly, justly, fairly and in accordance with law, and 
that corrupt practices are guarded against."  Article 219(d) of the 
“Constitution” further provides that the “ECP” is charged with the 
duty of “the holding of general elections to the National Assembly, 
Provincial Assemblies and the local governments”. Similarly, Article 
220 provides that “it shall be the duty of all executive authorities in 
the Federation and in the Provinces to assist the Commissioner and 
the Election Commission in the discharge of his or their functions”. 
These constitutional provisions dealing with role, powers and 
responsibilities of the “ECP”, have been elaborated and interpreted in 
a number of judgments by this Court as well as the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan. This Court in “TARIQ IQBAL Versus ELECTION 
COMMISSION OF PAKISTAN and others” (PLD 2022 Lahore 607) 

Writ Petition No.5851of 2023                
 
   13 
has held that the Election Commission of Pakistan is the apex, 
independent and neutral constitutional authority to hold, organize 
and conduct elections in Pakistan.  The Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in “WORKERS' PARTY PAKISTAN through Akhtar 
Hussain, Advocate, General Secretary and 6 others Versus 
FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN and 2 others” (PLD 2012 SC 681) 
while 
elaborating 
and 
interpreting 
Article 
218(3) 
of 
the 
“Constitution”  observed as under: 
"40. A bare reading of Article 218(3) makes it 
clear that the Election Commission is charged 
with the duty to 'organize' and 'conduct the 
election'. The language of the Article implies 
that the Election Commission is responsible 
not only for conducting the election itself, but 
also for making all necessary arrangements 
for the said purpose, prior to the Election 
Day. By conferring such responsibility on the 
Election 
Commission, 
the 
Constitution 
ensures that all activities both prior, on and 
subsequent to Election Day, that are carried 
out 
in anticipation thereof, adhere to 
standards of justness and fairness, are honest, 
in accordance with law and free from corrupt 
practices. This Court in Election Commission 
of Pakistan v. Javaid Hashmi and others 
(PLD 
1989 
SC 
396), 
observed 
that 
"(g)enerally speaking election is a process 
which starts with the issuance of the election 
programme and consists of the various links 
and stages in that behalf, as for example, 
filing of nomination papers, their scrutiny, the 
hearing of objections and the holding of 
actual polls. If any of these links is challenged 
it really (is) tantamount to challenging the 
said process of election". It interpreted that 
the phrase 'conduct the election' as having 
"wide import" and including all stages 
involved in the election process. These 
observations subject all election related 
activities that take 
place between 
the 
commencement and the end of the election 
process to the jurisdiction conferred on the 
Election Commission under Article 218(3). 
The Election Commission therefore has to test 
all election related activities that are carried 
out in the relevant period, both individually

   14 
and 
collectively, 
against 
the 
standards 
enumerated therein”.                    Emphasis added 
 
16.      The interpretation of Article 218(3) by the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court in this case clearly indicates that the Election 
Commission of Pakistan is the ultimate authority to ensure the 
conduct of elections in accordance with law i.e. the provisions of 
the “Constitution” as well as the “Act”, and such authority is not 
limited to the election day or subsequent to it but also to all stages 
prior to it, while the election process starts with issuance of 
election program which in turn starts with the declaration of date 
of election. This broader role and responsibility of the ECP is 
further elaborated by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in “WORKERS' 
PARTY PAKISTAN  supra which reads as 
"42. ... Article 220 of the Constitution also directs the 
Federal and Provincial machinery to assist the Election 
Commission in fulfilling its constitutional responsibilities. 
The law, therefore, entrusts the Election Commission with 
exclusive, broad and extensive powers to attend to all issues 
related directly and ancillary to the election process." 
 
17. 
The above mentioned findings of Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in this case was further reaffirmed in PLD 2021 Supreme 
Court 480 in the case of REFERENCE BY THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN, UNDER ARTICLE 
186 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF 
PAKISTAN, 1973.  
18. 
The authority of the “ECP” regarding the conduct of elections 
in accordance with law was further extended by the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court 
of 
Pakistan 
in 
“Sheikh 
RASHID 
AHMED 
Versus  
GOVERNMENT OF PUNJAB and others” (PLD 2010 SC 573) 
wherein it has held that “the provision of Article 220 of the 
Constitution also reflects to be in pari materia with the provision of 
Article 190 of the Constitution”.  This extended powers of the “ECP” 
were further elaborated in “ADMINISTRATOR MUNICIPAL 

Writ Petition No.5851of 2023                
 
   15 
CORPORATION, PESHAWAR and others Versus TAIMUR HUSSAIN 
AMIN and others” (2021 SCMR 714) wherein the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court held that;  
“6.    …Article 220 of the Constitution mandates that, 
'It shall be the duty of all executive authorities in the 
Federation and in the Provinces to assist the 
Commissioner and the Election Commission in the 
discharge of his or their functions.' In case the 
Federation and/or the Province(s) create hurdles in 
the way of the Commission holding elections, they 
will be violating the Constitution, which may attract 
serious consequences”. 
 
19. 
Although, Article 224(2) read with Article 105 and 112 of the 
“Constitution” does not specifically mentions the authority to declare 
a date of election in a provincial assembly in case it stands dissolved 
by operation of law but in the light of jurisprudence developed in 
aforesaid judgments, it can safely be concluded that the “ECP” being 
apex, independent and neutral constitutional authority mandated under 
the “Constitution” to hold, organize and conduct elections in Pakistan 
in accordance with law is the ultimate constitutional authority to 
ensure compliance of Article 224(2) of the “Constitution” under the 
doctrine of Penumbra which refers to a legal principal that recognizes 
certain unenumerated rights and obligations as implicit in the 
guarantees of the Constitution which can also be termed as 
constitutional penumbras. Under this doctrine, a specific provision of 
a Constitution or a State should not be read in isolation and it must be 
considered in the context of other relevant and connecting provisions 
of a constitution or a statute which underlying values and principles of 
the constitution as a whole. The doctrine if penumbra enable the 
Courts in interpreting various provisions of the constitution in order to 
enforce those rights and obligations which are explicitly mentioned in 
the text of a particular provision of the constitution or a law.  Keeping 
the aforesaid doctrine in view, when Articles 218(3) which cast a 
constitutional duty upon the “ECP” to organize and conduct elections 
and to ensure that the election is conducted in accordance with law 

Writ Petition No.5851of 2023                
 
   16 
that is the “Constitution”, the “Act” and the Elections Rules, 2017 
read with Article 219(d) which charged the “ECP” with the duty of 
holding the general elections to the provincial assemblies read with 
Article 224(2)  and 220 of the “Constitution” which cast a duty on all 
the executive authorities in the federation and in the provinces to 
assist the “ECP”  in discharge of its constitutional functions, are 
being considered together being connecting and relevant provisions, 
the obligation and duty of the “ECP” to declare the date of general 
election for the Province comes within the penumbra of these 
constitutional provisions and elections laws.  
20. 
In view of the constitutional provisions mentioned above and 
the judgments of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, the prayer made in 
the “consolidated petitions” is allowed and the “ECP” is directed to 
immediately announce the “date of election” of the Provincial 
Assembly of Punjab with the Notification specifying reasons, after 
consultation with the Governor of Punjab, being the constitutional 
Head of the Province, to ensure that the elections are held not later 
than ninety days as per the mandate of the “Constitution”.
