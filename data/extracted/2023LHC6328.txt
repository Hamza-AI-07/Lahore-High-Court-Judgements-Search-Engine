ABID HUSSAIN CHATTHA, J. The Petitioner in W. P. No. 9041 / 2023 
joined the National Bank of Pakistan (the “NBP”) on 17.01.2007. He was 
served charge sheet and show cause notice on 31.05.2021 and was dismissed 
from service vide order dated 14.04.2022 which was upheld in appeal vide 
order dated 04.01.2023. The Petitioner in W. P. No. 26490 / 2023 joined 
NBP in the year 2003 and was served charge sheet and show cause notice on 
09.09.2021 which culminated into his dismissal from service vide order 
dated 17.03.2022 and the same was upheld in appeal vide order dated 
28.03.2023. The Petitioners, in the titled Petitions, call into question the 
concurrent dismissal Orders passed against them in the service hierarchy of 
NBP. 
2. 
At the time of initiation of disciplinary proceedings against the 
Petitioners, the statutory National Bank of Pakistan (Staff) Service Rules, 
1973 (the “Rules, 1973”) had been repealed and the National Bank of 
Pakistan (Staff) Service Rules, 2021 (the “Rules, 2021”) were in force. 

2 
W. P. No. 9041 of 2023 
W. P. No. 26490 of 2023 
 
Accordingly, at the very outset, learned counsel for the Respondents / NBP 
vociferously raised a preliminary objection regarding the maintainability of 
the titled Petitions on the ground that the Rules, 2021 are non-statutory and 
as such, the Petitioners could not invoke the constitutional jurisdiction of 
this Court under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”). Hence, common question qua 
maintainability of the titled Petitions constitutes the substance of this 
Judgment. 
3. 
Learned counsels for the Respondents submitted that NBP was 
incorporated under the National Bank of Pakistan Ordinance, 1949 (the 
“Ordinance”) and was later included in the Schedule of nationalized banks 
pursuant to the Banks (Nationalization) Act, 1974 (the “Nationalization 
Act”). As such, NBP exists, operates and functions within the legal frame-
work enshrined under the Ordinance and the Nationalization Act. The terms 
and conditions of services of the employees of NBP were earlier regulated 
under the statutory Rules, 1973 which were made by the Board of Directors 
(the “Board”) of NBP with the approval of the Federal Government. 
Subsequently, the Board framed the National Bank of Pakistan (Staff) 
Service Rules, 1980 (the “Rules, 1980”) which were non-statutory and the 
same displaced the statutory Rules, 1973. It was accordingly held in case 
titled, “National Bank of Pakistan and another v. Punjab Labour Appellate 
Tribunal and 2 others” (1993 SCMR 105). However, subsequently the larger 
Bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan in case titled, “Muhammad Tariq 
Badr and another v. National Bank of Pakistan and others” (2013 SCMR 
314) held that non-statutory Rules, 1980 could not displace the statutory 
Rules, 1973. Thereafter, the Board of NBP has made the Rules, 2021 after the 
repeal of the statutory Rules, 1973 by the Federal Cabinet in its meeting held 
on 01.04.2021. Consequently, all employees of NBP are currently regulated by 
non-statutory Rules, 2021. Hence, the Petitioners cannot question the validity 
of dismissal orders under the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court. 
4. 
Learned counsel for the Petitioners, in rebuttal, submitted that the 
Petitioners joined their services in NBP much earlier than the introduction of 
the Rules, 2021 and as such, their terms and conditions of service were 

3 
W. P. No. 9041 of 2023 
W. P. No. 26490 of 2023 
 
protected under the Rules, 1973 pursuant to the mandatory command of 
Section 13 of the Nationalization Act. Therefore, the Rules, 2021 cannot be 
applied to determine the case of the Petitioners. This is evident from the fact 
that the show cause notices issued to the Petitioners do not specifically refer 
to the Rules, 2021, rather, simply and conveniently employ the general term, 
“NBP (SSR)”. He further emphasized that Section 13 of the Nationalization 
Act in unequivocal terms provides protection to the existing employees of 
NBP prior to promulgation of the Rules, 2021 with respect to terms and 
conditions of their service. Therefore, Section 11 of the Nationalization Act 
which empowers the Board of NBP to frame new rules cannot be read in 
isolation but in conjunction with Section 13 of the Nationalization Act which 
is in the field and has not been amended so far. He asserted that Section 13 
of the Nationalization Act was purposely discussed and conclusively 
interpreted by the Apex Court in Muhammad Tariq Badr case (supra) vis-à-
vis the rights and interests of existing employees of NBP. Therefore, Section 
13 of the Nationalization Act is required to be interpreted in the light of law 
laid down by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in similar situations in cases 
titled, “Masood Ahmed Bhatti and others v. Federation of Pakistan through 
Secretary, M/O. Information Technology and Telecommunication and 
others” (2012 SCMR 152); and “Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited and others v. 
Said Rehman and others” (2013 SCMR 642). He maintained that in another 
case titled, “Muhammad Ali Gohar Zaidi v. House Building Finance 
Corporation & others” (C. A. No. 26-K of 2012), where the employees had 
joined the institution having statutory rules but later on, the corporation was 
converted into a company having non-statutory rules, it was held that the 
employees of the statutory corporation would be protected under the 
statutory rules despite adoption of  non-statutory rules by the company.  
5. 
Learned counsel for the Petitioners further contended that 
notwithstanding the fact that the Petitioners as existing employees of NBP 
are governed by the statutory Rules, 1973, even the Rules, 2021 are liable to 
be construed as statutory in terms of law laid down in cases titled, “P.T.C.L. 
and others v. Masood Ahmed Bhatti and others” (2016 SCMR 1362); and 
“Shafique Ahmed Khan and others v. Nescom through Chairman, Islamabad 
and others” (PLD 2016 Supreme Court 377) since mere non-approval of 

4 
W. P. No. 9041 of 2023 
W. P. No. 26490 of 2023 
 
the Federal Cabinet is not the sole principle to term the Rules as non-
statutory. He further apprised that maintainability of a constitutional Petition 
in terms of the Rules, 2021 has been resolved by the Division Bench of 
Sindh High Court in C. P. No. D-4598 of 2021 titled, “NBP Officers 
Welfare Association and Others” decided on 07.02.2023 and C. P. No. D-
1372 of 2022 titled, “Muhammad Rehan v. Federation of Pakistan and 2 
others” decided on 22.02.2023. Finally, he stated that even otherwise, the 
proceedings against the Petitioner, Basar Ali in Writ Petition No. 26490 / 
2023 were initiated in the year 2020 when he was suspended through staff 
order dated 22.10.2020, therefore, the objection qua maintainability is liable 
to be discarded. 
6. 
Learned counsels for NBP responded that the rules, circulars and 
policies in vogue apply to all the existing employees of NBP and they cannot 
seek benefits under the repealed or non-existent rules, policies and circulars 
as held in cases titled, Umar Hayat Khawaja v. National Bank of Pakistan 
through President and 2 others” (2015 PLC (C.S.) 1331); and “Umar Hayat 
Khawaja v. National Bank of Pakistan through President and 5 others” (2019 
PLC (C.S.) 258). In this context, it was argued that Muhammad Tariq Badr 
case (supra) is not relevant any more for the reason that the Federal 
Government has itself repealed the Rules, 1973. The Cabinet Committee for 
Disposal of Legislative Cases approved the repeal of the Rules, 1973 in its 
meeting held on 18.03.2021, the Federal Cabinet ratified the decision on 
01.04.2021 and the same was published in the Gazette on 15.04.2021. 
Consequently, the current position emerges that the Board of NBP while 
exercising its powers under Section 11 of the Nationalization Act approved 
the non-statutory Rules, 2021 after repeal of the statutory Rules, 1973 
without any saving clause. As such, the Board of NBP has competently 
framed the non-statutory Rules, 2021. Reliance was placed on case titled, 
“Idrees Ahmad and others v. Hafiz Fida Ahmad Khan and 4 others” (PLD 
1985 Supreme Court 376) to explain that the effect of repealing a statute is 
to obliterate it completely from the record of Parliament as if it had never 
been passed and as such, it is considered as law that never existed except for 
the purposes of those actions which were commenced, prosecuted and 
concluded when it was an existing law. Hence, the actions initiated prior to 

5 
W. P. No. 9041 of 2023 
W. P. No. 26490 of 2023 
 
the repeal of the Rules, 1973 are protected and will be decided according to 
the Rules, 1973 but the actions initiated after the repeal of the Rules, 1973 
are not protected and will be decided according to the Rules, 2021 as held in 
case titled, “Mst. Siddiqan Afzal and 6 others v. Assistant Collector of 
Central Excise and Land Customs, Faisalabad and 2 others” (PLD 2001 
Lahore 78). 
7. 
Learned counsels for the Respondents argued that powers of the 
Board of NBP under Section 11 of the Nationalization Act was dealt with by 
the Division Bench of this Court in case titled, “Rana Muhammad Khalil v. 
Regional Audit Chief, NBP Audit Office” (2018 PLC (C.S.) 442) and the 
same was upheld by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in C. P. No. 3345 of 
2017 in case titled, “Rana Muhammad Khalil v. Regional Audit Chief, NBP, 
Lahore” decided on 17.10.2018. It was stressed that Section 13 of the 
Nationalization Act has a limited scope which is subservient to the 
commands of law stipulated in Section 11 of the Nationalization Act. Since 
Section 13 thereof starts with the qualifying stipulation, “Save as otherwise 
provided in this Act…”, therefore, it protects all actions and powers 
mentioned in Section 11 of the Nationalization Act. This principle of 
interpretation has been endorsed in cases titled, “Fazal Din v. Settlement and 
Rehabilitation Commissioner, Gujranwala and another” (PLD 1977 Lahore 
305); “Muhammad Ramzan v. Mst. Khalida Perveen” (PLD 1971 Lahore 
813); and “Sultan Ali Lakhani v. Nasreen Jalil and 11 others” (1994 CLC 
1505). 
8. 
It was further apprised that the Supreme Court in case titled, 
“Muhammad Zaman and others v. Government of Pakistan through 
Secretary, Finance Division (Regulation Wing), Islamabad and others” 
(2017 SCMR 571) endorsed the powers of the Board of the State Bank of 
Pakistan after amendments in its relevant statute and the subsequent 
amendments made by the Board were held to be non-statutory. In this 
context, it was vehemently argued that since the Rules, 2021 are non-
statutory, therefore, the Petitioners cannot approach this Court in its 
constitutional jurisdiction in view of settled law laid down by the Supreme 
Court in cases titled, “Abdul Wahab and others v. HBL and others” (2013 
SCMR 1383); “Pakistan Telecommunication Co. LTD. through Chairman v. 

6 
W. P. No. 9041 of 2023 
W. P. No. 26490 of 2023 
 
Iqbal Nasir and others” (PLD 2011 Supreme Court 132); “Pakistan 
International Airline Corporation and others v. Tanweer-ur-Rehman and 
others” (PLD 2010 Supreme Court 676); and “Sui Southern Gas Company 
Limited and others v. Saeed Ahmed Khoso and another” (2022 SCMR 
1256). This is especially so when different High Courts have held that the 
Rules, 2021 are non-statutory. Reliance is placed on unreported cases titled, 
“Ammar Saleem v. Federation of Pakistan & others” (W. P. No.42399 of 
2023) decided on 21.06.2023 by this Court; “Faisal Taj v. National Bank of 
Pakistan & others” (W. P. No.1909-P of 2022) decided on 02.11.2022 by 
Peshawar High Court; and “All Pakistan NBP Officers Association, etc. v. 
Federation of Pakistan, etc.”  (W. P. No. 3008 of 2021) decided on 
06.03.2023 by the Islamabad High Court. Accordingly, it was prayed that 
the titled Petitions are liable to be dismissed on the question of 
maintainability. 
 
9. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
10. 
The Rules, 2021 made by the Board of NBP came into force at once 
upon repeal of the Rules, 1973 by the Federal Cabinet on 01.04.2021 as per 
Rule 1(2) of the Rules, 2021 before the date of issuance of charge sheets and 
show cause notices to the Petitioners. The initiation of disciplinary 
proceedings against the Petitioners is required to be reckoned from the date 
of issuance of charge sheets and show cause notices to the Petitioners which 
is acknowledged by them in their respective Petitions. Therefore, the 
contention that the date of initiation of disciplinary proceedings should be 
construed from some earlier date such as the date of suspension is 
completely misconceived. Hence, there is no ambiguity that the Petitioners 
were proceeded under the Rules, 2021. Accordingly, the following points of 
determination emerge from the rival arguments of the parties:- 
(i) 
Whether the Petitioners as existing employees of NBP before 
the introduction of Rules, 2021 were liable to be proceeded 
under the repealed statutory Rules, 1973 and if so, the titled 
Petitions are maintainable?  
(ii) 
Whether the Rules, 2021 are the only service rules in existence 
after the repeal of the non-statutory Rules, 1973? and 

7 
W. P. No. 9041 of 2023 
W. P. No. 26490 of 2023 
 
(iii) 
 If so, whether the Rules, 2021 are non-statutory and as such, 
the titled Petitions are not maintainable? 
11. 
NBP as a statutory nationalized bank is run, operated and managed by 
its Board under the Ordinance and the Nationalization Act. The latter is a 
subsequent enactment and Section 2 of the Nationalization Act postulates 
that it shall have effect notwithstanding anything contained in any other law 
for the time being in force or in any agreement and contract, award, 
memorandum or articles of association or other instrument. Thus, the 
Nationalization Act preempts the provisions of the Ordnance in case of any 
inconsistency between the two enactments. The Nationalization Act has 
been amended from time to time. Section 11 of the Nationalization Act in its 
current dispensation relates to general provisions pertaining to management 
of banks. It mandates that every bank shall have a Board headed by a 
President who shall be its Chief Executive Officer and the Board shall 
consist of not less than five and not more than seven other members. 
Importantly, Section 11(4) thereof proclaims that the general direction and 
superintendence of the affairs and business of a bank and overall policy 
making in respect of its operations, shall vest in its Board. Section 11(5) 
thereof specifically empowers the Board to determine the credit policies, 
evaluation criteria for the performance of its employees other than the 
President, personnel policies of the bank including appointment and removal 
of officers and employees, guidelines for entering into any compromise with 
borrowers and other customers and any other policy matter. Section 11(9) 
thereof stipulates that the President, subject to the control and directions of 
the Board, shall exercise powers of management of the affairs of the bank. 
More specifically, Section 11(10) thereof unequivocally declares that all 
selections, promotions and transfer of employees except the President and 
decisions as to their remuneration and benefits shall be made by the 
President in accordance with the evaluation criteria and personnel policy 
determined by the Board.  
12. 
Section 13 of the Nationalization Act contains provisions regarding 
the staff of nationalized banks and the same is reproduced as under:- 

8 
W. P. No. 9041 of 2023 
W. P. No. 26490 of 2023 
 
“(1) Save as otherwise provided in this Act, all officers and other 
employees of a bank shall continue in their respective offices and 
employments on the same terms and conditions, including 
remuneration and rights as to pension and gratuity, as were 
applicable to them immediately before the commencing day.  
(2) Notwithstanding any law or any provision contained in a contract, 
agreement, letter of appointment, rules or regulations of a bank, every 
officer and employee of a bank shall be liable to transfer to any of its 
branches in or outside Pakistan or to any other bank: 
Provided that his status and emoluments shall not be adversely 
affected.” 
 
13. 
The Nationalization Act has been promulgated to nationalize banks 
included in its Schedule. Careful and plain reading of Section 13 of the 
Nationalization Act makes it manifestly evident that the existing employees 
of nationalized banks were granted limited statutary protection regarding 
continuity of service on the same terms and conditions including 
remuneration and rights as to pension and gratuity, as were applicable to the 
employees of the banks before the commencement of the Nationalization 
Act. Obviously, there were other private banks which were also nationalized 
through the Nationalization Act. As such, the Nationalization Act was not 
only applicable to NBP as an existing statutory bank owned by the Federal 
Government but was applicable to all other private banks which were 
nationalized through the Nationalization Act. The provisions of Section 13 
of the Nationalization Act must be interpreted in this peculiar context that in 
order to alleviate the concerns of existing employees, statutory intervention 
was made to the effect that their terms and conditions will not be varied to 
their disadvantage in monetary terms. The only intelligible classification of 
employees made in this behalf was with respect to existing employees before 
nationalization and the employees recruited after nationalization. In this 
behalf, the required continuity in the services of existing employees was 
granted which was subject to other provisions of the Nationalization Act as 
is evident from the qualifying opening phrase, “save as otherwise provided 
in this Act” employed in Section 13 of the Nationalization Act. 
14. 
Thus, Section 11 of the Nationalization Act is the general, catch-all, 
overriding and overarching provision of law vesting all powers of 
management of a bank in its Board without any restrictions, limitations or 

9 
W. P. No. 9041 of 2023 
W. P. No. 26490 of 2023 
 
caveats except as otherwise ordained by law. Surely, Section 11 of the 
Nationalization Act is the dominant and controlling provision of law which 
preempts and prevails over Section 13 of the Nationalization Act. Even 
otherwise, Section 13 of the Nationalization Act does not place an embargo 
or limitation upon the powers of the Board of NBP to frame service rules for 
its employees subject to limited statutory protection to its employees 
existing or in service before the date of promulgation of the Nationalization 
Act. Therefore, the distinction drawn by the Petitioners regarding existing 
employees before the date of promulgation of Rules, 2021 and new 
employees recruited after the date of enforcement of Rules, 2021 has no 
statutory basis. Even otherwise, the limited statutory protection granted to all 
existing employees of the banks at the time of promulgation of the 
Nationalization Act in terms of Section 13 thereof, has fully matured due to 
afflux of time as there would not be any existing employee after passing of 
47 years since the date of enforcement of the Nationalization Act.  
15. 
Section 32(1) of the Ordinance empowers the Board of NBP, with the 
prior approval of the Federal Government, to make Bye-laws not 
inconsistent with the Ordinance to provide for all matters for which 
provision is necessary or convenient for the purpose of giving effect to the 
provisions of the Ordinance. Section 32(2) of the Ordinance lists specific 
matters regarding which the Bye-laws can be made and clause (xxviii) 
thereof confers powers with respect to the recruitment of officers and staff of 
NBP including the terms and conditions of their service and the constitution 
and management of staff and superannuation funds for the officers and 
employees of NBP.  
16. 
In exercise of powers conferred under Section 32 of the Ordinance, 
the National Bank of Pakistan Bye-laws, 1970 (the “Bye-laws, 1970”) were 
framed. Bye-law 18(a)(iii) & (iv) grants powers to the Board of NBP to 
frame service rules for its employees, with the previous approval of the 
Federal Government. Accordingly, the Rules, 1973 were made by the Board 
of NBP with the prior approval of the Federal Government. As per Rule 1(2) 
thereof, the Rules, 1973 came into effect on 01.01.1972 with the stipulation 
that the cases already decided before the commencement of the Rules, 1973 

10 
W. P. No. 9041 of 2023 
W. P. No. 26490 of 2023 
 
shall not be reopened if the decision taken is in conflict with any of 
provisions of the Rules, 1973. Rule 2 of the Rules, 1973 provides that they 
shall apply to all employees of NBP provided that they shall not apply, 
except as otherwise provided therein or to such extent as may be specially or 
generally prescribed by the Managing Director, to (a) staff on deputation 
from Government; and (b) staff or specialists recruited or engaged on special 
contracts or terms. Rule 2(2) of the Rules, 1973 further provides that the 
terms and conditions of service of local employees engaged in foreign 
branches of NBP will be determined in each case by the Managing Director 
keeping in view the provisions therein and the local conditions. Rule 4 of the 
Rules, 1973 states that the Board of NBP, with the prior approval of the 
Federal Government, reserves the right of altering, modifying or omitting 
any of the rules laid down as may be found necessary from time to time. 
Accordingly, the Rules, 1973 were held as statutory and there is no dispute 
to this effect. 
17. 
Later, the Board of NBP invoked its direct management powers 
vested under Section 11 of the Nationalization Act and as such, additionally 
made the Rules, 1980. They were made under Bye-law 18(a)(iii) & (iv) of 
the Bye-laws, 1970 read with Section 11(4) of the Nationalization Act which 
came into effect on 01.01.1980. As such, the Rules, 1980 were declared as 
non-statutory having been made by the Board of NBP without recourse to 
the Federal Government by the Apex Court in National Bank of Pakistan 
case (supra). However, the Rules, 1980 were made during the existence of 
the Rules, 1973 without their repeal. Consequently, both set of rules were in 
the field at the relevant time.    
18. 
Subsequently, in Muhammad Tariq Badr case (supra), the Supreme 
Court explored as to whether the non-statutory Rules, 1980 displaced the 
statutory Rules, 1973. It was concluded that non-statutory Rules, 1980 
framed by the Board of NBP could not annul, repeal, rescind or displace the 
statutory Rules, 1973. In this context, it was observed that Section 13(1) of 
the Nationalization Act unambiguously postulates that the service of the 
officers and other employees of the nationalized banks have in fact and in 
true sense and spirit been secured and protected on the same terms and 

11 
W. P. No. 9041 of 2023 
W. P. No. 26490 of 2023 
 
conditions which were applicable to them immediately before the 
commencement of the Nationalization Act. Since, the Rules, 1973 were in 
force before the commencement of the Nationalization Act with respect to 
terms and conditions of service of the employees of NBP, therefore, by 
virtue of Section 13(1) of the Nationalization Act, they were specifically 
safeguarded and shielded instead of having been replaced, repealed, 
rescinded or overridden. It was further held that language of Section 13(1) of 
the Nationalization Act spells out the clear intention of the legislature to 
preserve the earlier terms and conditions of employees of the nationalized 
banks which in the present case undoubtedly were the Rules, 1973. Hence, 
the Board of NBP constituted under Section 11 of the Nationalization Act in 
exercise of its management powers could not make non-statutory rules to 
displace or annul the statutory Rules, 1973 which were in force since the 
executive is not empowered to annul, invalidate or vitiate the command of 
the statute. Accordingly, it was held that irrespective of the timing of 
induction in service, the Rules, 1973 being statutory, would govern the terms 
and conditions of service of all employees of NBP as they had not been 
repealed for otherwise, it would be ludicrous and discriminatory to hold the 
employees with same and equal status who were taken in service prior to the 
Rules, 1980 to enjoy the benefit of statutory Rules, 1973 and those joining 
after the Rules, 1980 be deprived from the protection of statutory Rules, 
1973.   
19. 
It is manifestly evident from the above that the Supreme Court did not 
envisage any fetters on the powers of the Federal Government to amend or 
repeal the statutory Rules, 1973 which had been made with the prior 
approval of the Federal Government. In exercise of such powers, the Federal 
Government validly repealed the Rules, 1973. In the meanwhile, the Bye-
laws, 1970 were substituted by the National Bank of Pakistan Bye-laws, 
2015 (the “Bye-Laws, 2015”). Bye-law 51 thereof employs the language 
embodied in Section 11 of the Nationalization Act and empowers the Board 
of NBP to determine the personnel policies and staff service rules without 
recourse to the Federal Government while unequivocally acknowledging and 
recognizing the management powers of the Board subject to regulation by 

12 
W. P. No. 9041 of 2023 
W. P. No. 26490 of 2023 
 
the State Bank of Pakistan and adherence to the provisions of the Ordinance, 
the Nationalization Act and to the extent possible to the Code of Corporate 
Governance issued by the Securities & Exchange Commission of Pakistan. 
Hence, upon the repeal of the Rules, 1973 by the Federal Cabinet, the Board 
in exercise of its management powers vested under Section 11 of the 
Nationalization Act read with Bye-law 51, of the Bye-laws, 2015 framed the 
Rules, 2021 for its employees. Thus, both Section 11 of the Nationalization 
Act and Bye-law 51 of the Bye-laws, 2015, granted powers to the Board of 
NBP to frame service rules without the approval of the Federal Government.   
20. 
Reliance by the Petitioners on Masood Ahmed Bhatti, Said Rehman 
and Muhammad Ali Gohar Zaidi cases (supra) is misplaced. In the said 
cases, the distinction between employees in terms of applicability of rules 
qua terms and conditions of their service is rooted in specific statutory 
dispensation and not on a general principle of law. It is trite law that every 
case is to be decided according to its own peculiar facts and circumstances, 
therefore, the findings in the said cases with reference to specific statutory 
provisions could not be applied to the facts and circumstance of the instant 
case. 
21. 
Similarly, Muhammad Rehan case (supra) decided by the High Court 
of Sindh is of no help to the case of the Petitioners as the officers of NBP 
therein were proceeded under the Rules, 1973 since show cause notices were 
issued to them before the enforcement of the Rules, 2021. Likewise, NBP 
Officers Welfare Association case (supra) decided by the High Court of 
Sindh is also inapplicable as the matter in issue therein relates to alleged 
breach of policy decision regarding payment of annual increment to the 
employees from a particular date starting from the year 2020 taken by the 
management of NBP which itself is a statutory nationalized bank. Further, 
the determination regarding the nature of the Rules, 2021 with reference to 
their applicability qua service matters of the employees of NBP is made 
without reference to the Nationalization Act which overrides the Ordinance 
as noted above, particularly, Section 11 of the Nationalization Act which 
confers powers upon the Board of NBP to frame rules. The scope of Section 
11 of the Nationalization Act as the dominant and preemptive command of

W. P. No. 9041 of 2023 
W. P. No. 26490 of 2023 
 
law in terms of vesting complete management powers in the Board of NBP 
free from the interference of the Federal Government was recognized by the 
Division Bench of this Court in Rana Muhammad Khalil case (supra). 
Moreover, Bye-law 51 of the Bye-laws, 2015 itself grants exclusive and 
unfettered powers upon the Board of NBP to frame service rules without 
approval of the Federal Government. The same was endorsed by the 
Supreme Court in C. P. No. 3345 of 2017 vide order dated 17.10.2018. This 
aspect creates a conspicuous and obvious distinction between the Rules, 
2021 made by the Board without approval of the Federal Government vis-à-
vis the repealed statutory Rules, 1973 which had been made by the Board of 
NBP with the prior approval of the Federal Government. In this context, the 
contention of the Petitioners that the Rules, 2021 are liable to be construed 
as statutory in terms of law laid down in Shafique Ahmed Khan case (supra) 
on the ground that mere non-approval of the Federal Cabinet is not the sole 
criteria to term the rules as non-statutory is misconceived for the reason that 
that the Rules, 2021 even in terms of their nature and area of efficacy are 
non-statutory as they deal with instructions for internal control or 
management and their area of efficacy is not broader or complimentary to 
the parent statute in the matters of crucial importance. Therefore, the 
reasoning of the Supreme Court in Muhammad Zaman case (supra) is 
squarely applicable to the facts of the titled cases. 
22. 
The act of making non-statutory Rules, 2021 by the Board of NBP 
after the repeal of the statutory Rules, 1973 by the Federal Government is 
apparently a conscious effort by the management of NBP in concert with the 
Federal Government to streamline the human resource of NBP in order to 
bring it at par with other private banks in the increasingly competitive 
commercial arena considering that primary services of any bank are in the 
nature of provision of efficient services to its customers. Undoubtedly, NBP 
is a statutory commercial bank and in order to retain its viability, is expected 
and required to compete with other commercial banks. As such, the desire to 
exercise control over its employees at par with other private banks is quite 
natural. Therefore, there is absolutely no harm in the stated objective 
provided the same is achieved after due process within the ambit of law.

23. 
Therefore, it is safely concluded that the Rules, 2021 made by the 
Board of NBP in exercise of its powers conferred under Section 11 of the 
Nationalization Act read with Bye-law 51 of the Bye-laws, 2015 without 
approval of the Federal Government are non-statutory. After the repeal of 
statutory Rules, 1973, only the Rules, 2021 are in vogue and the same 
indiscriminately apply to all employees of NBP employed after the date of 
enforcement of the Nationalization Act subject to Rule 2 of the Rules, 2021. 
24. 
The nutshell of the above discussion is that the Petitioners having 
been rightly proceeded under non-statutory Rules, 2021 were not entitled to 
institute the titled Petitions under Article 199 of the Constitution. 
Accordingly, the titled Petitions are not maintainable and are, hereby, 
dismissed.
