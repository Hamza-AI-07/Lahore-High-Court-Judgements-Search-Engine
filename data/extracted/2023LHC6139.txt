Criminal Appeal No. 395 of 2021 
(Muhammad Saleem versus The State and another) 
 
JUDGMENT 
Date of hearing: - 
25-10-2023 
Appellant by: - 
M/s Tariq Mehmood Khan and Syed Zeeshan 
Haider, Advocate.   
State by: - 
Mr. Javed Iqbal Bahaya, ADPP.  
Complainant by: - M/s Mian M. Haroon Shakil and Muhammad Gulzar 
Khaliq, Advocates. 
 
Muhammad Tariq Nadeem. J:- Muhammad Saleem (appellant) was 
tried in case FIR No.251/2018 dated 15.08.2018 in respect of an offence 
under section 376 PPC, registered at Police Station Shedani Sharif, District 
Rahim Yar Khan After the conclusion of trial, learned trial court, vide 
judgment dated 11.09.2021, convicted and sentenced the appellant as infra: -  
Under section 376(1) PPC: 14-years rigorous imprisonment 
with fine of Rs.1,00,000/- and in default thereof to further 
undergo simple imprisonment for six months.  
 
Benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C. was, however, extended to 
him.    
 
Feeling aggrieved, the appellant has filed the titled appeal against his 
conviction and sentence.   
2. 
Tersely, the facts of the case as narrated in FIR (Exh.PC) got 
registered by Mst. Ishrat Bibi complainant are that she was resident of 
Khanbela and married with Allah Bakhsh eleven years ago. Out of that 
wedlock, two daughters were born who are alive but due to strained 
relations, Allah Bakhsh divorced the complainant about four years ago, 
thereafter, she came to the house of her parents. Muhammad Saleem 
appellant had visiting terms with the family of complainant. Five months 

Crl. Appl. No. 395 of 2021  
2
ago, he (appellant) said to the complainant that he would marry her and at 
the promise of marriage, he used to commit rape with her. When the 
complainant told him that it is a sin, he extended threats that if she would not 
fulfill his desire, he would not marry her. Due to this reason, the 
complainant was compelled to join the appellant, who used to commit rape 
with her. As a result of rape, she conceived pregnancy and when she told 
this fact to the appellant, he asked her for abortion with the plea that her 
pregnancy was not the outcome of his cohabitation with her. The 
complainant narrated the whole occurrence to PWs namely Saeed Ahmad 
son of Ghulam Nabi caste Jundela resident of Shedani Sharif and Malik 
Manzoor Ahmad son of Ghulam Fareed caste Machhi resident of Bait 
Dewan, before whom the appellant also confessed his guilt. The appellant 
did not contract Nikah with the complainant and due to rape with her, she 
conceived pregnancy. Hence, this case.   
3. 
After completion of investigation, the result of investigation was 
encapsulated in report under Section 173, Code of Criminal Procedure, 
1898, which was submitted before the learned trial court. The appellant was 
summoned by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Liaquatpur, to face the 
trial. Copies of relevant documents were provided to him as required under 
Section 265-C, Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 and formal charge was 
framed against him on 09.10.2018, to which he pleaded not guilty and 
claimed trial. 
 
Thereafter the complainant filed an application before the learned trial 
for DNA test regarding blood grouping of appellant with blood grouping of 
minors Duaa Fatima aged about one and a half years and Aqsa Bibi aged 
about two months with the contention that the appellant under the pretext of 
contracting marriage with the complainant had been committing zina with 
her, which resulted into the birth of above said minors. The learned trial 
court dismissed the application vide order dated 20.04.2019. The 
complainant assailed the above mentioned order through Criminal Revision 
No.81 of 2019 in this Court which was partly allowed vide order dated 

Crl. Appl. No. 395 of 2021  
3
26.01.2021 with the concurrence of learned counsel for the parties to the 
extent of conducting “DNA test of Aqsa Bibi minor”. In the light of above 
mentioned order, DNA test was conducted and according to the report of 
PFSA (Exh.PH), it was opined by analyst that Muhammad Saleem 
(appellant) could not be excluded as being the biological father of Aqsa Bibi.        
In order to prove its case, the prosecution produced as many as nine 
witnesses during the trial. Ocular account has been furnished by Mst. Ishrat 
Bibi complainant/victim (PW4), whereas Saeed Ahmad (PW5), who only 
got recorded his examination-in-chief and cross-examination was reserved, 
was given up by the prosecution being won over by the appellant, therefore, 
only the solitary statement of Mst. Ishrat Bibi complainant/victim (PW4) 
remained in the field.   
Faisal Abbas, ASI (PW3), being investigating officer, stated about 
various steps taken by him during the investigation of this case.  
Medical evidence was furnished by Lady Doctor Mehnaz Abbasi 
(PW8), who conducted medical examination of Mst.Ishrat Bibi complainant/ 
victim (PW4).  
Rest of the prosecution witnesses, more or less, are formal in nature. 
After completion of prosecution evidence, statement of the appellant under 
Section 342, Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 was recorded, wherein he 
refuted the allegation levelled against him and professed his innocence. The 
appellant opted not to appear as his own witness in disproof of the allegation 
as provided under Section 340(2), Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, 
however, he opted to produce certain documents in his defence evidence. 
Upon conclusion of trial, the appellant was convicted and sentenced by the 
learned trial court as mentioned and detailed above. Hence, this appeal. 
4. 
Learned counsel for the appellant, in support of this appeal, contends 
that from bare reading of crime report (Exh.PC) and statement of Mst.Ishrat 
Bibi complainant/victim (PW4), it is crystal clear that the offence under 

Crl. Appl. No. 395 of 2021  
4
section 376 PPC  is  not made out and at the most, offence under section 
496-B, PPC could be attracted according to the facts and circumstances of 
the case; that no complaint in terms of section 203-C, Cr.P.C. has been filed 
about the offence of fornication; that although medical evidence has fully 
proved the case of prosecution and it is also proved through the report of 
PFSA (Exh.PH) that the appellant cannot be excluded as being the biological 
father of Aqsa Bibi but the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the 
factum of rape with Mst. Ishrat Bibi complainant/victim (PW4) without her 
consent; lastly submitted that this appeal may be accepted and the appellant 
may be acquitted of the charge.   
5. 
On the other hand, learned counsel for the complainant has 
vociferously argued that the offence for which the appellant has been 
convicted and sentenced is an offence against society; that the prosecution 
has proved its case up to the hilt through cogent and confidence inspiring 
evidence of Mst. Ishrat Bibi complainant/victim (PW4), which is duly 
supported by medical evidence and PFSA report; that there is no material 
contradiction in the prosecution evidence; that the report of PFSA (Exh.PH), 
alone, is sufficient to hold that the appellant has committed rape with the 
complainant; that the learned trial court while already taking a lenient view 
has sentenced the appellant only for fourteen years R.I.; that this appeal has 
no force, therefore, the same may be dismissed.  
6. 
Learned Law Officer has frankly conceded that from the evidence on 
the file, the offence under section 376 PPC is not made out, however, it is a 
case of fornication as a result of which a girl has born, so her rights be 
protected appropriately.  
7. 
I have heard the learned counsel for the appellant as well as learned 
counsel for the complainant and learned ADPP meticulously and perused the 
record minutely with their able assistance.  
8. 
In order to prove its case, besides Mst. Ishrat Bibi complainant/victim 
(PW4), the prosecution produced Saeed Ahmad (PW5), however, he got 
recorded his examination-in-chief on 03.10.2020 and was not produced for 

Crl. Appl. No. 395 of 2021  
5
cross-examination rather he was given up by the prosecution on 08.05.2021 
being won over by the appellant. In this way, only the solitary statement of 
Mst. Ishrat Bibi complainant/victim (PW4) remained in field.  
I have observed that Mst. Ishrat Bibi complainant/victim (PW4) has 
narrated almost similar story as she had described in her written application 
(Exh.PB), on the basis of which formal FIR (Exh.PC) was chalked out. 
Although medical evidence duly confirms the fact that Muhammad Saleem 
appellant cannot be excluded as being the biological father of Aqsa Bibi 
(offspring of rape) but it is to be seen that from the contents of FIR and the 
evidence recorded by Mst. Ishrat Bibi complainant/victim (PW4) before the 
learned trial court, whether offence under section 376 PPC is made out or it 
is a case of fornication?  
 
To better resolve this controversy, I deem it appropriate to have a 
glance over the relevant provisions of law. This case pertains to year 2018, 
for the reason, the definition of rape given in section 375, PPC before 
substitution (vide Act XLVI 2021) reads as under: - 
 
375. Rape. A man is said to commit rape who has sexual 
intercourse with a woman under circumstances falling under 
any of the five following descriptions, 
(i) against her will; 
(ii) without her consent; 
(iii) with her consent, when the consent has been obtained by 
putting her in fear of death or of hurt; 
(iv) with her consent, when the man knows that he is not 
married to her and that the consent is given because she 
believes that the man is another person to whom she is or 
believes herself to be married; or 
(v) with or without her consent when she is under sixteen 
years of age. 
 
 Explanation. Penetration is sufficient to constitute the sexual 
intercourse necessary to the offence of rape.  
 
 
The term ‘consent’ has been defined in section 90 of Pakistan Penal 
Code which is hereby described as under: -  
90. Consent known to be given under fear or misconception, 
Consent is not such a consent as is intended by any action of 
this Code, if the consent is given by a person under fear of 

Crl. Appl. No. 395 of 2021  
6
injury or under a misconception of fact and if the person 
doing the act knows, or has reason to believe, that the consent 
was given in consequence of such fear or misconception: or 
Consent of insane person. —If the consent is given by a 
person Who from unsoundness of mind or intoxication, is 
unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to 
which he gives his consent; or 
Consent of child. Unless the contrary appears from the 
context, if the consent is given by a person who is under 
twelve years of age. 
 
Consent by a victim in a rape case was discussed by the Supreme 
Court of India in case titled as “Uday v. State of Karnataka” (AIR 2003 
Supreme Court 1639) as infra:-  
 
“it therefore appears that the consensus of judicial opinion is 
in favour of the view that the consent given by the prosecutrix 
to sexual intercourse with a person with whom she is deeply 
in love on a promise that he would marry her on a later date, 
cannot be said to be given under a misconception of fact. A 
false promise is not a fact within the meaning of the Code. We 
are inclined to agree with this view, but we must add that 
there is no strait jacket formula for determining whether 
consent given by the prosecutrix to sexual intercourse is 
voluntary, or whether it is given under a misconception of 
fact. In the ultimate analysis, the tests laid down by the 
Courts provide at best guidance to the judicial mind while 
considering a question of consent, but the Court must, in each 
case, consider the evidence before it and the surrounding 
circumstances, before reaching a conclusion, because each 
case has its own peculiar facts which may have a bearing on 
the question whether the consent was voluntary, or was given 
under a misconception of fact. It must also weigh the evidence 
keeping in view the fact that the burden is on the prosecution 
to prove each and every ingredient of the offence, absence of 
consent being one of them. 
…………………………………………………………………………
……………………………………………….…………..…………… 
Keeping in view the approach that the Court must adopt in 
such cases, we shall now proceed to consider the evidence on 
record. In the instant case, the prosecutrix was a grown up 
girl studying in a college. She was deeply in love with the 
appellant. She was however aware of the fact that since they 
belonged to different castes, marriage was not possible. In 
any event the proposal for their marriage was bound to be 
seriously opposed by their family members. She admits 
having told so to the appellant when he proposed to her the 
first time. She had sufficient intelligence to understand the 
significance and moral quality of the act she was consenting 

Crl. Appl. No. 395 of 2021  
7
to. That is why she kept it a secret as long as she could. 
Despite this, she did not resist the overtures of the appellant, 
and in fact succumbed to it. She thus freely exercised a choice 
between resistance and assent. She must have known the 
consequences of the act, particularly when she was conscious 
of the fact that their marriage may not take place at all on 
account of caste considerations. All these circumstances lead 
us to the conclusion that she freely, voluntarily, and 
consciously consented to having sexual intercourse with the 
appellant, and her consent was not in consequence of any 
misconception of fact. 
 
There is another difficulty in the way of the prosecution. 
There is no evidence to prove conclusively that the appellant 
never intended to marry her. Perhaps he wanted to, but was 
not able to gather enough courage to disclose his intention to 
his family members for fear of strong opposition from them. 
Even the prosecutrix stated that she had full faith in him. It 
appears that the matter got complicated on account of the 
prosecutrix becoming pregnant. Therefore, on account of the 
resultant pressure of the prosecutrix and her brother the 
appellant distanced himself from her. 
 
There is yet another difficulty which faces the prosecution in 
this case. In a case of this nature two conditions must be 
fulfilled for the application of Section 90 IPC. Firstly, it must 
be shown that the consent was given under a misconception 
of fact. Secondly, it must be proved that the person who 
obtained the consent knew, or had reason to believe that the 
consent was given in consequence of such misconception. We 
have serious doubts that the promise to marry induced the 
prosecutrix to consent to having sexual intercourse with the 
appellant. She knew, as we have observed earlier, that her 
marriage with the appellant was difficult on account of caste 
considerations. The proposal was bound to meet with stiff 
opposition from members of both families. There was 
therefore a distinct possibility, of which she was clearly 
conscious, that the marriage may not take place at all despite 
the promise of the appellant. The question still remains 
whether even if it were so, the appellant knew, or had reason 
to believe, that the prosecutrix had consented to having 
sexual intercourse with him only as a consequence of her 
belief, based on his promise, that they will get married in due 
course. There is hardly any evidence to prove this fact. On the 
contrary the circumstances of the case tend to support the 
conclusion that the appellant had reason to believe that the 
consent given by the prosecutrix was the result of their deep 
love for each other. It is not disputed that they were deeply in 
love. They met often, and it does appear that the prosecutrix 
permitted him liberties which, if at all, is permitted only to a 
person with whom one is in deep love. It is also not without 

Crl. Appl. No. 395 of 2021  
8
significance that the prosecutrix stealthily went out with the 
appellant to a lonely place at 12 O'clock in the night. It 
usually happens in such cases, when two young persons are 
madly in love, that they promise to each other several times 
that come what may, they will get married. As stated by the 
prosecutrix the appellant also made such a promise on more 
than one occasion. In such circumstances the promise loses 
all significance, particularly when they are over come with 
emotions and passion and find themselves in situations and 
circumstances where they, in a weak moment, succumb to the 
temptation of having sexual relationship. This is what 
appears to have happened in this case as well, and the 
prosecutrix willingly consented to having sexual intercourse 
with the appellant with whom she was deeply in love, not 
because he promised to marry her, but because she also 
desired it. In these circumstances it would be very difficult to 
impute to the appellant knowledge that the prosecutrix had 
consented in consequence of a misconception of fact arising 
from his promise. In any event, it was not possible for the 
appellant to know what was in the mind of the prosecutrix 
when she consented, because there were more reasons than 
one for her to consent.” 
 
Likewise the Supreme Court of India, in its recent pronouncement on 
30.01.2023, while dealing with the point of consent in almost an identical 
case titled as Naim Ahmad vs. State (Nct of Delhi) wherein a married 
woman was allegedly raped by the accused with the assurance that he would 
solemnize marriage with her, has held as under: -  
“21. In the instant case, the prosecutrix who herself was a 
married woman having three children, could not be said to 
have acted under the alleged false promise given by the 
appellant or under the misconception of fact while giving the 
consent to have sexual relationship with the appellant. 
Undisputedly, she continued to have such relationship with 
him at least for about five years till she gave complaint in the 
year 2015. Even if the allegations made by her in her 
deposition before the court, are taken on their face value, 
then also to construe such allegations as 'rape' by the 
appellant, would be stretching the case too far The 
prosecutrix being a married woman and the mother of three 
children was matured and intelligent enough to understand 
the significance and the consequences of the moral or 
immoral quality of act she was consenting to. Even otherwise, 
if her entire conduct during the course of such relationship 
with the accused, is closely seen, it appears that she had 
betrayed her husband and three children by having 
relationship with the accused, for whom she had developed 
liking for him. She had gone to stay with him during the 

Crl. Appl. No. 395 of 2021  
9
subsistence of her marriage with her husband, to live a better 
life with the accused. Till the time she was impregnated by the 
accused in the year 2011, and she gave birth to a male child 
through the loin of the accused, she did not have any 
complaint against the accused of he having given false 
promise to marry her or having cheated her. She also visited 
the native place of the accused in the year 2012 and came to 
know that he was a married man having children also, still 
she continued to live with the accused at another premises 
without any grievance. She even obtained divorce from her 
husband by mutual consent in 2014, leaving her three 
children with her husband. It was only in the year 2015 when 
some disputes must have taken place between them, that she 
filed the present complaint. The accused in his further 
statement recorded under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. had stated 
that she had filed the complaint as he refused to fulfill her 
demand to pay her huge amount. Thus, having regard to the 
facts and circumstances of the case, it could not be said by 
any stretch of imagination that the prosecutrix had given her 
consent for the sexual relationship with the appellant under 
the misconception of fact, so as to hold the appellant guilty of 
having committed rape within the meaning of Section 375 of 
IPC. 
 
22. In that view of the matter, the accused deserves to be 
acquitted from the charges levelled against him. Of course, 
the direction for payment of compensation given by the courts 
below shall remain unchanged as the appellant had accepted 
the responsibility of the child, and has also paid the amount 
of compensation to the prosecutrix. 
 
9. 
Coming to the case in hand, I have observed that Mst. Ishrat Bibi 
complainant/victim (PW4) was previously married with one Allah Bakhsh 
and two daughters were born out of that wedlock, but about four years prior 
to the registration of FIR, she was divorced by Allah Bakhsh due to their 
strained relations and thereafter she came to her parental house. Muhammad 
Saleem appellant had visiting terms with her family and he had been 
committing rape with her at the promise of marriage. It may not be out of 
place to mention here that the complainant was not a minor girl; she had 
sufficient maturity and well aware of the consequences of sexual intercourse 
by the appellant with her. Even otherwise, her character is dubious because 
she herself admitted in her cross-examination as under:-    
“It is correct that in the year 2015 I had filed a petition under 
section 22-A & B, Cr.P.C. against Muhammad Aamir son of 

Crl. Appl. No. 395 of 2021  
10
Muhammad Majid which has been dismissed. It is correct 
that I had levelled same allegation against said Muhammad 
Aamir as has been levelled against present accused 
Muhammad Saleem”.  
 
10. 
The moot-point in this case is that whether the appellant committed 
rape with the complainant without her consent and if she offered herself for 
sexual intercourse on the false promise of marriage, then the offence under 
section 376 PPC will be applicable in this case or not? It is noteworthy that 
neither in the crime report (Exh.PC) nor in the statement of complainant 
(PW4), it has been mentioned that any force was used by the appellant for 
the said act. More so, prosecution evidence is also silent on the point that the 
complainant had allowed the appellant for commission of rape due to putting 
her in fear of death or hurt. Similarly, there is no evidence that the appellant 
committed rape with Mst. Ishrat Bibi complainant/victim (PW4) while 
showing himself as her husband. After scanning the entire prosecution 
evidence, I am quite confident to hold that it is not a case of rape in terms of 
section 375, PPC punishable under section 376, PPC rather it is abundantly 
clear that it is a case of ‘fornication’.  
 
11. 
Offence of fornication has been described in section 496-B, PPC 
which reads as under:-  
496B. Fornication.__(1) A man, and woman not married to 
each other are said to commit fornication if they willfully 
have sexual intercourse with one another. 
 
Furthermore, meaning of ‘fornication’ has been given in Black’s Law 
Dictionary, 11th Edition, as infra:-  
Fornication 1. Voluntary sexual intercourse between two 
unmarried persons, 2. Voluntary sexual intercourse with an 
unmarried woman. At common law, the status of the woman 
determined whether the offence was adultery or fornication--- 
adultery was sexual intercourse between a man, single or 
married, and a married woman not his wife, fornication was 
sexual intercourse between a man, single or married, and a 
single woman.  
Similarly, fornication has also been defined in Webster’s New World 
Law Dictionary by Susan Ellis Wild, Legal Editor, as under:-  

Crl. Appl. No. 395 of 2021  
11
Fornication. Consensual sex between two individuals not 
married to one another.  
 12. 
It is noteworthy that no FIR can be registered under the offence of 
fornication as envisaged under section 203(c), Cr.P.C. which is mentioned 
below: 
[203-C. Complaint in case of fornication.--- (1) No Court 
shall take cognizance of an offence under section 496-B of 
the Pakistan Penal Code, except on a complaint lodged in a 
Court of competent jurisdiction. 
(2) The Presiding Officer of a Court taking cognizance of an 
offence shall at once examine oath the complainant and at 
least two eye-witnesses to the act of fornication.  
(3) The substance of the examination of the complainant and 
the witnesses shall be reduced to writing and shall be signed 
by the complainant, and the witnesses, as the case may be, 
and also by the Presiding Officer of the Court. 
(4) If in the opinion of the Presiding Officer of a Court, there 
is sufficient ground for proceeding the Court shall issue 
summons for the personal attendance of the accused. 
Provided that the Presiding Officer of a Court shall not 
require the accused to furnish any security except a personal 
bond, without sureties, to ensure attendance before the Court 
in further proceedings. 
(5) The Presiding Officer of a Court before whom a 
complaint is made or to whom it has been transferred may 
dismiss the complaint, if, after considering the statements on 
oath of the complainant and the witnesses there is, in his 
judgment, no sufficient ground for proceeding and in such 
case he shall record his reasons for so doing. 
(6) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions or anything 
contained in any other law for the time being in force no 
complaint under this section shall be entertained against any 
person who is accused of Zina under section 5 of the Offence 
of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979 
(Ordinance No. VII of 1979) and against whom a complaint 
under section 203-A of this Code is pending or has been 
dismissed or who has been acquitted or against any person 
who is a complainant or a victim in a case of rape, under 
any circumstances. 
 
Similarly, the term complaint has been defined in section 4(h), Cr.P.C. 
which is reproduced hereunder: - 
4(h) “Complaint”. “Complaint” means the allegation made 
orally or in writing to a Magistrate with a view to his taking 
action under this Code, that some person whether known or 
unknown, has committed an offence, but it does not include 
the reports of a police-officer.” 

Crl. Appl. No. 395 of 2021  
12
 
Even otherwise, it is a well settled principle of law that complaint and 
police report have distinctive features. Report of police has been described 
in Section 173, Cr.P.C. which is also reproduced for ready reference:- 
173. Report of police officer. 
(1) Every investigation under this Chapter shall be 
completed without   unnecessary delay, and as soon as 
it is completed, the officer in charge of the police 
station shall, through the Public Prosecutor,] 
(a) forward to a Magistrate empowered to take 
cognizance of the offence on a police report a report, 
in 
the 
form 
prescribed 
by 
the 
3[Provincial 
Government], setting forth the names of the parties, 
the nature of the information and the names of the 
persons who appear to be acquainted with the 
circumstances of the case, and stating whether the 
accused (if arrested) has been forwarded in custody or 
has been released on his bond, and, if so, whether with 
or without sureties, and 
(b) communicate, in such manner as may be 
prescribed by the 3[Provincial Government], the 
action taken by him to the person, if any, by whom the 
information relating to the commission of the   offence 
was first given [:] 
Provided that, where investigation is not completed 
within a period of fourteen days from the date of 
recording  of  the  first  information report  under  
section  154,  the  officer  in  charge  of  the  police  
station shall, within  three days of the expiration of 
such period, forward to the Magistrate through the 
Public Prosecutor, an interim report in the form 
prescribed by the Provincial Government stating 
therein the result of the investigation made until then 
and the Court shall commence the trial on the basis of 
such interim report, unless, for reasons to  be 
recorded, the  Court decides that the trial should not  
so commence.] 
(2) Where a superior officer of police has been 
appointed under section 158, the report shall, in any 
cases  in  which  the  1[Provincial  Government]  by  
general  or  special  order  so  directs,  be  submitted 
through  that officer, and he may, pending the orders 
of the Magistrate, direct the officer in charge of the  
police station to make further investigation. 

Crl. Appl. No. 395 of 2021  
13
(3) Whenever it appears from a report forwarded 
under this section that the accused has been released 
on his  bond,  the  Magistrate  shall  make  such order  
for  the  discharge  of  such bond  or  otherwise  as  he 
thinks fit. 
(4) A copy of any report forwarded under this section 
shall, on application, be furnished to the accused 
before the commencement of the inquiry or trial: 
Provided that the same shall be paid for unless the 
Magistrate for some special reason thinks fit to furnish 
it free of cost.] 
(5) where the officer in charge of a police station 
forwards a report under sub-section (1), he shall along 
with the report produce the witnesses in the case, 
except the public servants, and the Magistrate shall 
bind such witnesses for appearance before him or 
some other Court on the date fixed for trial.]   
 
 
A comparative study of above mentioned sections i.e. 4(h) and 173 
Cr.P.C. it is palpable that complaint cannot be termed as police report. The 
learned trial court was not competent to take cognizance of this case because 
from bare reading of FIR (Exh.PC), it manifests that the case in hand is of 
fornication and no complaint was ever placed before the learned trial court 
in terms of section 203, Cr.P.C. In the light of above mentioned facts, 
cognizance taken by the learned trial court was unwarranted and proceedings 
conducted by it were coram non judice.  
13. 
After completion of arguments of learned counsel for the parties and 
learned Law Officer, this Court made query to learned counsel for the 
appellant that when it is a stance of the defence that it is a case of fornication 
and not of rape and such a stance is also established from the documentary 
evidence in the shape of DNA report (Exh.PH) according to which Aqsa 
Bibi (minor), who is an offspring of fornication, is a biological daughter of 
the appellant, then who will be responsible for her upbringing and welfare, 
they replied that the appellant is ready to deposit Defense Saving Certificates 
to the tune of Rs.10,00,000/- in the name of Aqsa Bibi (minor).  
14. 
For what has been discussed above, the prosecution has failed to 
prove the charge of rape under section 376 PPC against the appellant,

therefore, the titled appeal is accepted; consequently, conviction and 
sentence of Muhammad Saleem appellant recorded by learned trial court is 
set aside and he is acquitted of the charge. However, he shall be 
enfranchised trice from jail after the deposit of Defence Saving Certificate in 
the sum of Rs.10,00,000/- in the name of Aqsa Bibi minor, that too if he is 
not required to be detained therein in any other case. It is further directed 
that the Defence Saving Certificate shall be withdrawn by Aqsa Bibi minor 
after attaining the age of majority and only in case of severe need for the 
welfare of Aqsa Bibi minor, Mst. Ishrat Bibi complainant could draw the 
whole or partial amount after obtaining requisite permission from the 
learned Guardian Court in accordance with law.
