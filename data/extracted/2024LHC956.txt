RASAAL HASAN SYED, J. Petitioners 
through this constitutional petition assail orders 
dated 03.1.2023 and 23.6.2023 of the courts 
below by which an application under section 
151 C.P.C. objecting to admissibility of 
documents in the statement of D.W.1, was 
rejected 
and 
the 
revision 
petition 
filed 
thereagainst was also dismissed. 
2.  
Begum 
Tasneem 
Akhtar, 
since 
deceased and predecessor-in-interest of the 
present 
petitioners, 
brought 
a 
suit 
for 
declaration with consequential relief, claiming 
ownership of property and challenging the 

 
 
 
 
   
 
      W.P. No.49163 of 2023  
 
             Page-2 
 
 
 
execution and registration of certain documents 
on grounds of fraud, misrepresentation, etc. The 
suit was resisted by respondent No.6 by filing 
written statement. Issues were framed and after 
availing certain opportunities the petitioners 
concluded 
the 
evidence. 
On 
23.9.2022 
examination-in-chief of D.W.1 was recorded 
wherein certain documents were produced 
which were exhibited or marked as Exh.D-1 to 
Exh.D-4 
and 
Mark-DA 
to 
Mark-DD. 
Petitioners filed an application under section 
151, C.P.C. objecting to the admissibility of 
documents. The foundation of this objection 
was that they could not be proved in the 
statement of the witness because he was neither 
the author nor the scribe and unless necessary 
steps for proof of documents under Article 79 
of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 were 
adopted, the documents could not be exhibited 
or marked and that some of the documents 
having not been relied or sued upon could not 
be allowed to be produced without the 
permission of the court. The application was 
dismissed by learned Civil Judge vide order 
dated 03.1.2023. Revision petition of the 
petitioner against the said order was also 
dismissed by learned Addl. District Judge, 
Lahore vide order dated 23.6.2023.

3.  
Heard. 
4.  
Perusal of the documents available 
with the file reveals that suit for declaration was 
instituted to claim ownership of the property 
and to challenge the execution and registration 
of the documents viz. power of attorney dated 
22.4.2004, special power of attorney dated 
24.5.2004 and sale deed in favour of defendant 
No.4 (bearing document No.3827, book No.1, 
volume 704) registered with Sub-Registrar, 
Data Ganj Bakhsh Town, Lahore on 05.3.2005. 
Challenge to these documents was cast on 
grounds 
of 
fraud 
and 
cheating; 
their 
cancellation was prayed for.  
5.  
The suit was resisted by respondent 
No.6. Issues were framed and evidence of 
petitioners 
was 
concluded 
after 
certain 
opportunities. On 23.9.2022  examination-in-
chief of D.W.1 was recorded wherein certain 
documents 
were 
produced 
which 
were 
exhibited as Exh.D-1 to Exh.D-4 and Mark A to 
Mark C. The case was adjourned on plaintiff’s 
request for cross-examination. After taking two 
adjournments the application under section 151, 
C.P.C. dated 25.10.22 was moved wherein it 
was objected that the documents could not have 
been received in evidence as D.W.1 was neither 
their maker or scribe nor were the documents 

 
 
 
 
   
 
      W.P. No.49163 of 2023  
 
             Page-4 
 
 
 
were sued or relied upon and that these 
documents be de-exhibited and de-marked as 
they were not properly proved in accordance 
with law.  
6.  
This application was dismissed by the 
learned Civil Judge with the observation that 
the statement of D.W.1 was recorded on 
23.9.2022 whereafter upon the request of 
plaintiff’s learned counsel the case was 
adjourned for 06.10.2022 and that on the 
adjourned date a request for adjournment was 
yet again tendered by said learned counsel 
when it was adjourned to 25.10.2022 for cross-
examination and that on this date an application 
was filed raising the objection to the 
admissibility of documents. It was observed 
that when the documents were produced no 
objection was taken or raised and that the 
petitioner had yet to cross-examine the witness 
about documents.  
7.  
In revision petition the learned Addl. 
District Judge after taking into consideration 
the entire record of the case observed that the 
suit was filed on 03.9.2005, issues were framed 
on 09.1.2010 and that after due framing of 
issues the petitioner took certain opportunities 
for 
evidence 
and 
produced 
oral 
and 
documentary evidence comprising P.W.1 to 

 
 
 
 
   
 
      W.P. No.49163 of 2023  
 
             Page-5 
 
 
 
P.W.12 and Exh.P-1 to Exh.P-82. At his own 
turn defendant No.4 in the suit appeared as 
D.W.1, recorded his examination-in-chief on 
23.9.2022 and tendered Exh.D-1 to Exh.D-4 
and Mark-DA to Mark-DD in documentary 
evidence. It was observed that the record 
reflected that at the time of recording 
examination-in-chief of D.W.1 the production 
of documents was not objected to and in case 
the petitioners had any objection to production 
of the documents it could have been raised at 
the time of recording of the examination-in-
chief itself. It was also observed that mere 
production of documents would not entail that 
they had authenticity which was yet to be 
proved by the party that produced them and that 
evidentiary value of documents, if proved as 
per rule, will be seen by the trial court at the 
time of rendering final judgment.   
8.  
It is manifest from the observations in 
the 
order 
of 
revisional 
court 
that 
the 
apprehension of the petitioner regarding the 
alleged 
proof 
of 
documents, 
has 
been 
adequately attended to inasmuch as it is 
clarified that the document by mere tender 
could not be assumed or deemed to be authentic 
and that the party producing the same was 
obligated to prove the same. The view taken by 

 
 
 
 
   
 
      W.P. No.49163 of 2023  
 
             Page-6 
 
 
 
the revisional court appears to be sound, just 
and fair.  
9.  
There is a distinction between the 
admissibility and proof of documents. Where a 
document is tendered in evidence it cannot 
serve any purpose unless it is proved in 
accordance with law. The provisions of Articles 
78 and 79 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 
obligate the production of executant, marginal  
witnesses, scribe and other admissible evidence 
to prove any document, which cannot be 
dispensed with. In Dawa Khan through L.Rs 
and others v. Muhammad Tayyab (2013 SCMR 
1113) it was observed to the effect that 
admissibility of the document by itself will not 
absolve the party from proving its contents in 
terms of Article 79 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat 
Order, 1984. In Mst. Rabiyaz Bibi v. Matiur 
Rehman and others (2022 CLC 686) it was 
observed to the effect that the exhibiting of a 
document is one thing and its proof as 
prescribed by law is another and that exhibition 
of a document does not mean that it stands 
proved and that the parties relying upon such 
document are supposed to prove the same in 
accordance with law and procedure prescribed 
in Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 and that mere 
factum of exhibiting of a document shall not 

 
 
 
 
   
 
      W.P. No.49163 of 2023  
 
             Page-7 
 
 
 
tantamount to its proof irrespective of the fact 
that the document was exhibited and that too 
without objection. Reference can be made to 
the case of Khan Muhammad Yusuf Khan 
Khattak v. S.M. Ayub and 2 others (PLD 1973 
SC 160) where it was observed to the effect 
that even documents that were brought on 
record and exhibited without objection could 
remain on record as exhibits and faithful copies 
of the contents of the original but they cannot 
be treated as evidence of the original having 
been signed and written by the person who 
purportedly wrote or signed them unless the 
writing or the signature of that person is proved 
under the rules of evidence. In Messers Bengal 
Friends and Co. Dacca v. Messers Gour Benode 
Saha & Co., Calcutta and the Deputy Registrar 
of Trade Marks, Chittagong  (PLD 1969 SC 
477)  it was observed to the effect that if a 
document is alleged to have been written by 
any person, the signatures or the handwriting 
alleged to be of such person must be proved to 
be in his handwriting and that mere production 
of document kept in regular course of business 
did not constitute evidence of the entries 
contained therein unless the same is proved in 
accordance with law.  In Province of the Punjab 
through Collector Sheikhupura and others v. 

 
 
 
 
   
 
      W.P. No.49163 of 2023  
 
             Page-8 
 
 
 
Syed Ghazanfar Ali Shah and others (2017 
SCMR  172) it was observed to the effect that 
the provisions of Articles 72 to 101 of the 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 governing the 
mode of proof could not be compounded or 
dispensed with nor could the court which had to 
pronounce judgment as to proof or otherwise of 
the documents was precluded to see whether 
the documents had been proved in accordance 
with law and could, as such, form basis of its 
judgment.   
10. 
In the instant case the documents 
were simply tendered in the statement of D.W.1 
and as per order-sheet no objection was raised 
at the time of production of documents. The 
case was adjourned for 06.10.2022 when again 
a second adjournment was sought for cross-
examination and, finally, it on 25.10.2022 that 
the petitioner’s learned counsel filed an 
application under section 151, C.P.C. Although 
inaction and conduct of petitioners in not 
raising objection at the relevant time was 
material 
fact 
for 
declining 
exercise 
of 
discretionary jurisdiction under section 151, 
C.P.C. yet the petitioners cannot claim to have 
suffered adversely as mere production of 
document in the statement of a witness who is 
not claimed to be author thereof nor the 

 
 
 
 
   
 
      W.P. No.49163 of 2023  
 
             Page-9 
 
 
 
document having been relied upon, could not 
adversely affect the petitioners as the court has 
yet to see, after cross-examination of witnesses 
and other evidence on record, as to whether the 
documents were proved in accordance with law 
and the rule laid by the superior courts. Mere 
fact that the documents have been exhibited 
does not mean that the court is denuded of its 
obligation to consider the entire evidence so as 
to conclude whether or not the documents were 
proved in accordance with the provisions of 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 and their 
production alone will not, of course, mean that 
the documents are proved or are an evidence of 
the facts in controversy which were required to 
be 
proved 
by 
fulfilling 
the 
mandatory 
conditions of Article 79 of Qanun-e-Shahadat 
Order, 1984.  
11. 
In view of the settled rule the 
application filed by the petitioner, therefore, 
was rightly dismissed by the revisional court 
with observations and clarifications that the 
documents would only be used as piece of 
evidence if the litigants placing reliance thereon 
would be able to satisfy that they had produced 
the witnesses and followed the procedure as per 
Article 79 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. 
Being so the petitioners are fully protected and 

 
 
 
 
   
 
      W.P. No.49163 of 2023  
 
             Page-10 
 
 
 
there was hardly any justification to seek 
indulgence in the extraordinary jurisdiction of 
this Court.  
12. 
As upshot of the above instant 
petition being without substance is dismissed.
