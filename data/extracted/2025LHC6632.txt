Advocate. 
Respondent No.3 by: Proceeded against ex-parte on

      Anwaar Hussain, J.   Through this Constitutional Petition 
under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973, the petitioner impugns judgment dated 17.09.2019 rendered by the 
District Judge, Rahim Yar Khan, whereby the appeal filed by respondent 
No.3 (“the respondent”) was accepted and the judgment and decree of 
the Trial Court was modified. 
2.  
The controversy centers on four (04) marla of land which, the 
petitioner asserts, was transferred to the respondent by way of discharge 
of her dower (Haq-ul-Mehr). The petitioner’s case before the Trial Court 
was that the parties were married on 18.02.2014 and within few days 
thereafter, the petitioner purchased the said property from his father, Jam 
Kalu, having himself owned no immovable property; and then caused the 
same to be mutated directly in favour of the respondent as an oral sale. 
Mutation No.2232 dated 18.03.2014 was produced in evidence in support 
of this claim. It was further averred that the transaction occurred in the 
presence of the respondent’s brother, Farooq Ahmad, and that the transfer 
was intended solely to satisfy the dower obligation. 

W.P. No.7940 of 2019

3.  
Upon framing issues and evaluating the evidence, the Trial Court 
concluded that the oral transfer, from father of the petitioner to the 
respondent, together with the subsequent mutation amounted to a valid 
discharge of the dower debt. On appeal, however, the Appellate Court 
below reversed that conclusion and held that, since the property originally 
belonged to the petitioner’s father, the transaction was in truth a sale 
between a father-in-law and daughter-in-law—the respondent and could 
not be treated as discharge of Haq-ul-Mehr. That reasoning forms the 
nucleus of the present challenge. 
4.  
Learned counsel for the petitioner argues that the impugned 
judgment is vitiated by misreading and non-reading of material evidence. 
Adds that the Appellate Court below disregarded the admitted fact that the 
transfer occurred immediately after the marriage and without monetary 
consideration passing from the respondent — circumstances which, taken 
together, point unmistakably to an intention to satisfy the dower 
obligation. Conversely, the respondent was already proceeded against ex-
parte on 01.10.2025. 
5.  
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
6.  
This Court is conscious of the settled principle that where an 
Appellate Court below has reappraised evidence, interference by this 
Court is ordinarily unwarranted — a principle lucidly expounded in Mst. 
Farah Naz v. Judge Family Court, Sahiwal and others (PLD 2006 SC 
457). That principle, however, is not an inexorable fetter: where the 
Appellate Court below has manifestly ignored or misread material 
evidence, or proceeded on an erroneous factual premise that vitiates its 
conclusion, the constitutional and supervisory jurisdiction of this Court 
may and ought to be exercised, in the interest of justice. The question 
before this Court, therefore, is whether the Appellate Court’s approach in 
the present case falls within that exception. 

W.P. No.7940 of 2019 
                                                            
 
           - 3 - 
 
7.  
The marriage between the parties took place on 18.02.2014, and 
within less than a month, the petitioner caused the suit property belonging 
to his father to be transferred in favour of the respondent. The record 
shows that the petitioner purchased the land from his father and directly 
had it mutated, in the name of the respondent, without any monetary 
consideration moving from the respondent. Moreover, during cross-
examination, the respondent made a categorical statement to the effect 
that her husband had purchased the said property and got it mutated in her 
name. It reads as under: 
”یہ
 درتس ےہ ہک دماع ہیلع ےن ےھجم
 ااقتن ل ربمن2232
 ومر ہخ18.03.2014
 ےک ذرےعی  الپٹ4 
 رمےل قح
المہ ر لقتنم رک دای  ےہ۔ ہی طلغ
ےہ ہک ںیم ےن وھج
یٹ اہشد
ت دی ےہ۔“
 
This admission strikes at the very root of claim of the respondent that the 
transfer was independent of her dower entitlement. The Appellate Court 
below brushed aside this crucial statement by terming it a “slip of the 
tongue” on the ground that the respondent otherwise remained consistent 
in her pleadings and denied receipt of her dower. Such an approach is 
legally untenable inasmuch as cross-examination is a vital process through 
which truth is elicited and contradictions are tested. An admission 
obtained therein cannot be neutralized merely by describing it as an 
inadvertent or mistaken utterance, unless the record unmistakably 
demonstrates confusion or coercion. To label a deliberate, contextually 
coherent admission as a “slip of tongue” is to erode the entire purpose of 
cross-examination and to render the evidentiary process meaningless. The 
Appellate Court below, by doing so, failed to apply the correct evidentiary 
standard. 
8.  
Matter can be examined from another angle. The respondent never 
produced her brother Farooq Ahmad as a witness, despite the petitioner’s 
specific plea that said Farooq Ahmad was present at the time of passing of 
the mutation. Had the property truly been purchased by or on behalf of the 

W.P. No.7940 of 2019 
                                                            
 
           - 4 - 
 
respondent contra evidence should have been led by the respondent and 
her brother would have been the most natural witness to confirm the 
payment of consideration. No such evidence was brought on record, 
moreso when the respondent herself admitted that she possessed no 
financial means or resources to purchase property and was dependent 
upon the petitioner-her husband. This omission gives rise to an adverse 
inference under Article 129(g) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, that 
the withheld evidence, if produced, would have gone against her version. 
9.  
Furthermore, the timing and sequence of events unmistakably 
support the petitioner’s stance. The marriage was solemnized on 
18.02.2014; within a few weeks, on 18.03.2014, the sale mutation was 
attested in the respondent’s favour. The proximity of these events, coupled 
with the absence of consideration, clearly suggests that the transfer was 
intended to fulfil the dower obligation. The Appellate Court below 
overlooked these objective circumstances and instead rested its finding 
upon conjecture, presuming a sale transaction where none was proved. 
There exists no legal impediment to a father-in-law transferring property 
directly to his daughter-in-law through a valid sale mutation when such 
transfer is made at the instance of the husband in discharge of his 
acknowledged obligation to pay dower.  The law does not insist that the 
husband must first acquire the property in his own name and thereafter 
convey it to his wife.  Where the intention is clear and the transaction 
effectively satisfies the husband’s liability towards dower, a direct transfer 
by the father to the daughter-in-law stands as a lawful and bona fide mode 
of fulfilling that obligation.  
10.  
At this juncture, it is important to observe that in family matters, the 
Courts are inclined to adopt a sympathetic approach toward women where 
claims of dower or maintenance are denied or delayed; yet, such 
benevolence cannot extend to the disregard of clear and unequivocal 
evidence.

contemporaneous documentary proof, contradicts her claim, the Courts 
are bound to decide in accordance with evidence, not emotion. 
11.  
In the circumstances, this Court finds that the Appellate Court 
below materially misread the evidence and failed to apply settled legal 
principles. The sale mutation was executed soon after marriage, without 
any proof of payment or financial capacity on the respondent’s part. Her 
admission during cross-examination, coupled with the non-production of 
the most relevant witness, leads to the only reasonable inference that the 
transfer was made in discharge of the dower obligation and not as a sale. 
Consequently, the impugned judgment dated 17.09.2019 passed by the 
learned District Judge, Rahim Yar Khan is not sustainable in law and is 
hereby set aside, and the judgment and decree of the Trial Court dated 
22.03.2019 is restored.
