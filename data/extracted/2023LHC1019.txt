Advocate.

Assistant Advocate General. 
 
 
   SULTAN TANVIR AHMAD, J:–Through 
present Intra Court Appeal, filed under section 3 of the 
Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972, the appellant has assailed 
the order dated 16.12.2020, passed by learned Judge-in-
Chambers, in constitution petition No. 550 of 2017, 
whereby, the petition of the appellant has been dismissed 
on the basis of preliminary objection of maintainability of 
the petition in view of bar under Article 212 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
(the ‘Constitution’). 
2.  
 
Facts, necessary for the decision of the present 

 
I.C.A. No. 53-2021                        (Judgment) 
 
 
2 
case, are that appellant was appointed in Revenue 
Department on 01.05.1976 and upon attaining age of 
superannuation he was retired from his service on 
15.01.2008. In writ petition No. 550 of 2017 the appellant 
assailed order dated 22.11.2016 passed by respondent 
No.1, who exercised his powers under Punjab Civil 
Service (Pension Rules 1963) to withdraw the pension of 
the appellant. This order was challenged by invoking the 
constitutional jurisdiction of this Court, under Article 199 
of the Constitution through petition No. 550 of 2017, 
which was dismissed being not maintainable. Aggrieved 
from the same, present Intra Court Appeal has been filed.  
3.  
 
Sardar Abdul Raziq Khan, learned counsel for 
the appellant, has submitted that after retirement the 
appellant ceased to be a ‘civil servant’, therefore, the bar 
of Article 212 of the Constitution does not apply to the 
case; that impugned order is patently illegal and violates 
section 21 of the PEEDA Act, 2006; that the appellant or 
for that matter any citizen cannot be deprived of salary or 
pension by merely holding that the matter pertains to 
‘terms and conditions’, as these rights are fundamental 
rights of the citizens. It is further submitted by the learned 
counsel for the appellant that the learned Judge-in-
Chambers has failed to correctly interpret Article 212 of 
the Constitution as well as section 2(b) and section 4 of 
the Punjab Service Tribunal Act, 1974 (the ‘Tribunal 
Act’); that the impugned order has been passed without 
appropriately appreciating the definition of ‘civil servant’ 
as contained in section 2(b) of the Punjab Civil Servant 
Act, 1974 (the ‘Civil Servant Act’); that the entitlement 
and right of pension is conferred upon the appellant under 
section 18 of Civil Servant Act, thus, it was inevitable to 

 
I.C.A. No. 53-2021                        (Judgment) 
 
 
3 
interpret the element of maintainability of the constitution 
petition in the light of definition of ‘civil servant’ 
provided in the Civil Servant Act instead of the Tribunal 
Act, which is a fatal mistake requiring interference in this 
appeal. The learned counsel, during the course of 
arguments, has relied upon cases titled “Mst. Islam Bibi 
versus Government of Pakistan through Secretary State 
and Frontier Regions Division, Islamabad and 3 others” 
(2022 PLC (C.S.) 1196), “Mst. Chandni Asad versus 
Federation of Pakistan and others” (2020 PLC (C.S) 96), 
“Sher Zaman Ex-Assistant Excise and Taxation Officer 
(B-16) versus Board of Revenue Balochistan (Excise and 
Taxation Branch) through Member Board of Revenue-
II/Secretary Excise and another” (2020 PLC (C.S) 969), 
“Syed Raza Mehdi Baqari versus Province of Punjab 
through Secretary LG & CD Department and 2 others” 
(2016 PLC (C.S) 1046), “Abdul Wali versus WAPDA 
through its Chairman and others” (2004 SCMR 678), 
“Ehsan-ul-Haque versus Executive Engineer, Ahmadpur 
Canal Division Ahmadpur East and 2 others” (2011 PLC 
(C.S.) 1523), “Muhammad Younis versus Abbas Raza and 
6 others” (2005 PLC (C.S.) 833), “Abdul Aziz Virk 
versus 
Special 
Secretary, 
Education 
(Schools), 
Government of the Punjab, Lahore and 7 others” (2001 
PLC (C.S.) 661), “Khalid Imran Khan Barki versus 
Government of Punjab and others” (2021 PLC (C.S.) 
426), and “Jamshaid Khan versus Divisional Forest 
Officer and others”(K.L.R. 2013 Civil Cases 68). 
4.  
 
Conversely, Qazi Muhammad Nauman Sarwar, 
learned Assistant Advocate General, has fervently 
opposed the appeal and he has submitted that the learned 
Judge-in-Chambers has correctly interpreted Article 212 

 
I.C.A. No. 53-2021                        (Judgment) 
 
 
4 
of the Constitution and the relevant provisions of the 
concerned statutes. Learned Law Officer has relied upon 
case titled “Javed Iqbal versus Government of the Punjab 
through Secretary Forestry, Wildlife and Fisheries, 
Punjab lahore and 5 others” (PLJ 2021 Lahore 647) to 
defend the order passed by the learned Judge-in-
Chambers. He has further submitted that the pivotal 
question required determination is the maintainability of a 
petition under Article 199 of the Constitution and not the 
right of pension, if any, which can be agitated by the 
appellant before the appropriate forum.   
5.  
 
We have heard the arguments of the learned 
counsel of the parties and the documents available on the 
file have been perused with their able assistance. 
6.  
 
The question of law put-forth before us is that as 
to whether a person who admittedly remained member of 
civil service of the Province or held any civil post in 
connection with the affairs of the Province but upon 
attaining age of superannuation has retired from service, is 
able to maintain his petition under Article 199 of the 
Constitution or not, in the view of bar of Article 212 of 
the Constitution?  
7.  
 
We deem it appropriate to first examine Article 
212 of the Constitution and relevant provisions of the law, 
which are as follows:- 
Article 212 of the Constitution.  
(1) Notwithstanding anything hereinbefore 
contained the appropriate Legislature may by 
Act provide for the establishment of one or more 
Administrative Courts or Tribunals to exercise 
exclusive jurisdiction in respect of- 

 
I.C.A. No. 53-2021                        (Judgment) 
 
 
5 
 
(a)  matters relating to the terms and 
conditions of persons who are or have 
been in the service of Pakistan, 
including disciplinary matters; 
 
(b)  matters relating to claims arising from 
tortious acts of Government, or any 
person in the service of Pakistan, or of 
any 
local 
or 
other 
authority 
empowered by law to levy any tax or 
cess and any servant of such authority 
acting in the discharge of his duties as 
such servant; or 
 
(c)  matters relating to the acquisition, 
administration and disposal of any 
property which is deemed to be enemy 
property under any law. 
 
(2) 
Notwithstanding 
anything 
hereinbefore 
contained 
where 
any 
Administrative Court or Tribunal is established 
under clause (1), no other court shall grant an 
injunction, make any order or entertain any 
proceedings in respect of any matter to which 
the jurisdiction of such Administrative Curt or 
Tribunal extends and all proceedings in respect 
of any such matter which may be pending before 
such other court immediately before the 
establishment of the Administrative Court or 
Tribunal ; other than an appeal pending before 
the Supreme Court,] shall abate on such 
establishment] : 
 
Provided that the provisions of this clause 
shall not apply to an Administrative Court or 
Tribunal established under an Act of a 
Provincial Assembly unless, at the request of 
that Assembly made in the form of a resolution, 
[Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament)] by law extends 
the provisions to such a Court or Tribunal.

The definition of ‘civil servant’ is contained in section 
2(b) of the Tribunal Act and forum of appeal is provided 
in section 3 and 4, which reads as follows: -

8.  
Sardar Abdul Raziq Khan, learned counsel for 
the appellant has relied upon the definition of ‘civil 
servant’ in the Civil Servant Act to convince this Court 
that the learned Judge-in-Chambers has adopted incorrect 
approach.  Section 2(b) of Civil Servant Act is as follows:- 
      2. Definitions.---  
(1)  In this Act, unless there is anything 
repugnant in the subject or context,-- 
 
(a)   xxx 
 
(b)  “civil servant” means a person who 
is member of a civil service of the 

 
I.C.A. No. 53-2021                        (Judgment) 
 
 
8 
Province or who holds a civil post in 
connection with the affairs of the 
Province, but does not include-- 
 
 
 
(i)  a 
person 
who 
is 
on 
deputation to the province 
from the Federation or any 
other Province or Authority; 
 
 
 
(ii) 
 a person who is employed on 
contract, or on work-charged 
basis, or who is paid from 
contingencies; or 
 
 
(iii) 
a person who is a ‘worker’ 
or ‘workman’ as defined in 
the Factories Act, 1934 (XXV 
of 1934) or the Workmen’s 
Compensation 
Act, 
1923 
(VIII of 1923);  
9.  
Clause 1(a) of Article 212 of the Constitution 
provides that administrative courts or tribunals have 
exclusive jurisdiction when matters are relating to terms 
and conditions of persons who are or have been in 
service. The Constitution makers have chosen to oust the 
jurisdiction of all the courts but the tribunal with respect 
to all the matters relating to terms and conditions of 
servants who are or have been is service. The question 
involved in the constitutional petition pertains to pension 
which clearly relates to those terms and conditions subject 
to which the appellant joined the service and then he 
served the respective department. Section 2(b) read with 
sections 3 and 4 of Tribunal Act further clarifies this 
position that the jurisdiction of Punjab Service Tribunal 
extends when the matter is in respect of any of the terms 
and conditions of service of a person, who is or has been 
a member of civil service of the Province or holds or has 
held a civil post. There is no ambiguity in sub-section (b) 
of section 2 of the Tribunal Act that ‘civil servants’ for the 

 
I.C.A. No. 53-2021                        (Judgment) 
 
 
9 
given purposes include those who holds as well as the 
persons who have held the post in connection with affairs 
of the Province. The intention of legislature, to cover the 
person who held such post subject to condition that the 
question emanates out rights or obligations that relates to 
the terms and conditions, is very clear from the plain 
reading of wording of section 2(b) of the Tribunal Act. 
10. 
Articles 212 (1) and 212 (2) of the Constitution 
are 
non-obstante 
clauses, 
which 
starts 
with 
‘notwithstanding anything hereinbefore contained’ having 
prevailing effect over articles contained before the said 
article. Article 212(2) commands that no other court shall 
grant injunction, make any order or entertain any 
proceedings in respect of the matter if falls within the 
jurisdiction of such Administrative Court or Tribunal. 
Reference in this regard can be made to cases titled “I.A. 
Sharwani and others versus Government of Pakistan 
through Secretary, Finance Division, Islamabad and 
others” (1991 SCMR 1041), “Qazi M. Asif Jah Bahadur 
versus Government of the Punjab through Education 
Secretary, Lahore and 3 others” (2004 PLC (C.S.) 292), 
“Dr. Ghazanfarullah and 2 others versus Secretary 
Health, Government of the Punjab, Lahore and 6 others” 
(2010 PLC (C.S.) 51) and “Muhammad Aslam Bajwa 
versus Federation of Pakistan” (PLD 1974 Lahore 545). 
We would like to reproduce a relevant extract of Qazi 
Muhammad Asif Jan case (supra), which reads as 
follows:-  
        “We have considered the contentions 
of the learned counsel but are unable to 
subscribe the same inasmuch as in view of 
non-obstante operation of Article 212 the 

 
I.C.A. No. 53-2021                        (Judgment) 
 
 
10 
bar of jurisdiction gets attracted. In 
Muhammad Aslam Bajwa v. Federation of 
Pakistan (PLD 1974 Lahore 545) it was 
observed that the exclusionary provisions 
of Article 212 of the Constitution were 
applicable 
“notwithstanding 
anything 
hereinbefore contained” which takes 
within its ambit the preceding provisions 
of the Constitution.” 
11.  
Sardar Abdul Raziq Khan, learned counsel for 
the appellant, has relied upon section 2(b) of the Civil 
Servant Act and he stated that said section as well as rules 
framed thereunder do not recognize retired servant as 
‘civil servant’ and matter in hand pertains to pension, 
which accrued in his favour and then taken away when he 
ceased to be a civil servant. He has contended that this 
conflict is required to be resolved in favour of the 
appellant.  
12. 
The Civil Servant Act Chapter II deals with the 
terms and conditions of ‘civil servant’. Chapter II of the 
Civil Servant Act starts with section 3 which provides that 
“the terms and conditions of service of a civil servant 
shall be as provided in this Act and rules”. The appellant’s 
claim arises out of pension rights, which are provided in 
section 18 that falls in same Chapter (i.e. Chapter-II). The 
legislature, by including pension in the Chapter where the 
terms and conditions are provided and categorizing 
pension as one of terms of service of a civil servant, has 
left no uncertainty that though pension starts with the 
retirement but forms part of those terms and conditions to 
which the civil servant has joined the service. Section 22-
B of the Civil Servant Act, whereby restriction is imposed 
upon the Courts to issue orders in respect of proceedings 
under the Civil Servant Act or an order made thereunder, 

 
I.C.A. No. 53-2021                        (Judgment) 
 
 
11 
starts with save as provided by the act or Service Tribunal 
Act. This also leads to clear inference that the matters of 
terms and conditions mentioned in the Civil Servant Act 
are intended, by the legislature, to be heard by the forum 
provided in Service Tribunal Act. The grievances of the 
appellant and the matter in hand are squarely covered by 
the terms and conditions, thus, falls within the jurisdiction 
of service tribunal. This Court, therefore, does not have 
jurisdiction under article 199 of the Constitution. We are 
further fortified in our view by principle settled by the 
Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in case titled 
“Chief Secretary, Government of Punjab, Lahore and 
others versus Ms. Shamim Usman” (2021 SCMR 1390), 
whereby, following has been observed:- 
“We cannot lose sight of the fact that non-
obstante clauses of Articles 212(1) and 
(2) begin with “notwithstanding anything 
hereinbefore contained,” thus overriding, 
inter alia, the constitutional jurisdiction 
of the High Court under Article 199, 
which 
is 
already 
“subject 
to 
the 
Constitution.” Article 212(1)(a) provides 
that a Tribunal established under the law 
will enjoy exclusive jurisdiction in the 
matters relating to terms and conditions 
of persons who are or have been in the 
service of Pakistan, including disciplinary 
matters. The term “terms and conditions” 
is clearly spelt out in Chapter II of the 
Punjab Civil Servants Act, 1974 and the 
rules thereunder. Article 
212(2) 
in 
unambiguous terms states that no other 
Court can grant injunction, make any 
order or entertain any proceedings in 
respect of any matter to which the 
jurisdiction of such Administrative Court 
or Tribunal extends. Scope of jurisdiction 
and powers of the Tribunal are provided 
in sections 4 and 5 of the Act. The High 
Court, therefore, has no jurisdiction to 

 
I.C.A. No. 53-2021                        (Judgment) 
 
 
12 
entertain any proceedings in respect of 
terms and conditions of service of a civil 
servant which can be adjudicated upon by 
the Tribunal under the Act…” 
 
       (Underlining is added) 
13.  
Certain judgments have been relied by the 
learned counsel for the appellant, however, we have 
noticed that facts involved in most of those cases are 
distinguishable. In our view the learned Judge-in-
Chambers in paragraph No. 7 of the assailed judgment has 
also correctly distinguished the case law relied by the 
learned counsel of the appellant. As far as reliance of 
Sardar Abdul Raziq Khan on case titled “Mst. Islam Bibi 
(supra) is concerned, it is observed that a learned Division 
Bench of the Honourable Peshawar High Court exercised 
the constitutional jurisdiction in the matter relating to 
pension and / or gratuity but the petition was instituted by 
legal heirs of the civil servant after his death. Learned 
Division Bench of Peshawar High Court relied upon case 
titled “Muhammad Nawaz, Special Secretary, Cabinet 
Division, through his Legal Heirs versus Ministry of 
Finance, Government of Pakistan, through its Secretary, 
Islamabad” (1991 SCMR 1192) to reach the conclusion 
that family members or legal heirs of deceased servant 
cannot be termed as civil servant, however, it is 
categorically held that “it is also undeniable fact that 
pension and gratuity falls within the ambit of terms and 
conditions of a civil servant” thus, no benefit from the 
said judgment can be derived to support the contention of 
learned counsel of the appellant. As a matter of fact, 
careful reading of the said judgment reveals that same 
goes against the interest of the appellant.   

 
I.C.A. No. 53-2021                        (Judgment) 
 
 
13 
14. 
The question before us is of jurisdiction of this 
Court, which is of course different from the question that 
if the respondent-department has correctly withheld the 
pension of appellant. The latter aspect of the matter can 
always be considered, in such cases, by the learned forum 
having jurisdiction to adjudicate upon matters. Needless 
to observe that the question of delay, on account of 
pursuing remedy before this Court, can also be seen by 
the learned competent forum for which guidelines are 
available in number of judgments of the Honourable 
Supreme Court.   
15.  
In the wake of above discussion, we are of the 
view that learned Judge-in-Chambers has correctly 
appreciated the law on the subject, therefore, the same is 
upheld. Consequently, the present Intra Court Appeal, 
having no substance is dismissed. No order as to costs.
