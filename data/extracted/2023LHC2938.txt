For the Petitioner: 
Barrister Sharjeel Adnan Sheikh, assisted 
by Mian Hassan Raza and Khayyam-ul-
Hassan Lodhi, Advocates. 
For Respondents No.1 & 2:

Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – The Petitioner, Hayat Kimya 
Pakistan (Private) Limited, had appointed Apex Distribution and Marketing 
Services (Private) Limited (hereinafter referred to as “Apex”) as its non-
exclusive distributor for the sale and distribution of its products for certain 
parts of Karachi in terms of the Distribution Agreement dated 15.5.2019. As 
per clause 8.8 (read with clause 15.2) thereof, Apex could purchase products 
from the Petitioner on a deferred payment basis subject to furnishing post-
dated/undated cheque(s) of Rs.60.00 million as security. Apex was required 
to settle all the transactions made on a credit/deferred payment basis within 
40 days. Clause 15.3 provided that if the agreement expired or was 
terminated and/or Apex failed to perform its obligations under the 
Distribution Agreement, the Petitioner could collect any outstanding amount 
by encashing the security cheques. Clause 15.5 stipulated that if any such 
cheque was returned unpaid, the Petitioner could initiate criminal and/or 
civil proceedings without prejudice to other legal rights.

On 8.7.2021, the Petitioner filed an application under section 
22-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (hereinafter referred to as 
“Cr.P.C.” or the “Code”), before the Ex-officio Justice of Peace, Lahore, 
stating that it was in business with Apex and, in due course, Rs.15.00 
million became outstanding against it. Thereupon, Apex’s directors, 
Respondents No.1 & 2, gave the Petitioner three cheques (Cheque Nos. 
97479699, 1688258316 and CA-0053594927) for Rs.5.00 million each to 
pay Apex’s liabilities, but these were returned on presentation. It is pertinent 
to point out that Cheque No.97479699 was drawn on the personal account of 
Respondent No.1 with Summit Bank Limited, while Cheque Nos. CA-
0053594927 and 1688258316 were drawn on Apex’s two corporate accounts 
maintained with Faysal Bank Limited and MCB Bank Limited, respectively, 
and issued under the hand of Respondent No.2. 
3. 
 
The Petitioner’s application under section 22-A Cr.P.C. does 
not specify the precise date(s) when Respondents No.1 & 2 delivered it the 
above-mentioned cheques. However, their copies are available on record, 
which reflects that all of them are dated 4.5.2021. 
4. 
 
The Ex-officio Justice of Peace dismissed the Petitioner’s 
application under section 22-A Cr.P.C. vide Order dated 21.11.2022, holding 
that Respondents No.1 & 2 gave it Cheque Nos. 97479699, 1688258316 and 
CA-0053594927 by way of security under clause 8.8 (read with clause 15.2) 
of the Distribution Agreement. Section 489-F PPC does not apply to such 
cheques. The Petitioner has assailed that order in this Court under Article 
199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973  
(the “Constitution”). 
The submissions 
5. 
 
The Petitioner’s claim in its application before the Ex-officio 
Justice of Peace under section 22-A Cr.P.C. that Respondents Nos. 1 & 2 
gave it Cheque Nos. 97479699, 1688258316, and CA-0053594927 to cover 
Apex’s current bills. However, it appears that at the time of the final hearing 
it departed from that position and argued that they constituted security under 
the Distribution Agreement. The Ex-officio Justice of Peace has also passed 
the Order dated 21.11.2022 (the “Impugned Order”) on that premise. In its 
pleadings before this Court, particularly paragraphs 1(b), 2 and 3 of this 

Writ Petition No. 3103/2023 
 
- 3 - 
petition, the Petitioner has admitted that it received the aforementioned 
cheques as security. 
6. 
 
The Petitioner’s counsel, Barrister Sharjeel Adnan Sheikh, 
contends that the Ex-officio Justice of Peace has not properly appreciated the 
facts of the case and the applicable law while passing the Impugned Order. 
Apex unequivocally assured the Petitioner that it would observe and perform 
its obligations under the Distribution Agreement on time and in full. The 
parties agreed that the Petitioner would extend credit to Apex in exchange 
for security cheques and that it would be entitled to initiate civil and criminal 
proceedings if any of them bounced. The security cheques were essential to 
the arrangement, and the Petitioner would not have made it without them. 
Respondents No.1 & 2 are liable under both civil and criminal law for the 
dishonour of Cheque Nos. 97479699, 1688258316 and CA-0053594927, 
and cannot be excused for any reason. 
7. 
 
The counsel for Respondents No.1 & 2, Kh. Haris Ahmad, 
Advocate, contends that a person is not criminally liable under section 489-F 
PPC for the dishonour of a security cheque. He claims that Cheque Nos. 
97479699, 1688258316 and CA-0053594927 were undated when 
Respondents No.1 & 2 delivered them to the Petitioner. According to him, 
Cheque 
No. 97479699 
was issued 
on 13.5.2019, Cheque 
No.  
CA-0053594927 on 25.1.2020 and Cheque No.1688258316 on 2.7.2020, but 
the Petitioner put the date 4.5.2021 on all of them and had them 
dishonoured. Mr Ahmad states that Apex owes no money to the Petitioner. It 
has a dispute with the Petitioner and a claim of Rs.100,439,515/- against it; 
hence Respondents No.1 & 2 instructed the banks concerned to stop 
payment against the said cheques. Apex served the Petitioner with a notice 
of arbitration before it presented them. Mr Ahmad contends that a directive 
to register a case cannot be issued in such circumstances, and the Ex-officio 
Justice of Peace has rightly turned down the Petitioner’s request. 
Opinion 
8. 
 
Section 489-F in its present form was inserted in the Pakistan 
Penal Code, 1860 (“PPC”), by the Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance, 
2002. It reads as follows: 

Writ Petition No. 3103/2023 
 
- 4 - 
489-F. Dishonestly issuing a cheque.– Whoever dishonestly issues a 
cheque towards repayment of a loan or fulfillment of an obligation which 
is dishonoured on presentation, shall be punishable with imprisonment, 
which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both, unless he can 
establish, for which the burden of proof shall rest on him, that he had 
made arrangements with his bank to ensure that the cheque would be 
honoured and that the bank was at fault in not honouring the cheque. 
9. 
 
A bare perusal of section 489-F PPC shows that every 
dishonour of a cheque may not constitute an offence. This provision is 
attracted when the following conditions are fulfilled: (i) the cheque was 
issued with a dishonest intention; (ii) the cheque was for the repayment of a 
loan or fulfilment of a financial obligation; and (iii) the cheque was 
dishonoured on presentation. In Malik Safdar Ali v. Syed Khalid Ali and 
others (PLD 2012 Sindh 464), the Sindh High Court ruled that section 489-F 
PPC seeks to protect the public from financial fraud committed through 
dishonest cheques. According to it, section 420 PPC applies to all types of 
fraud, deceit and deception that cause loss to a person, but section 489-F 
PPC defines a separate offence when fraud or cheating is perpetrated using a 
cheque. 
10. 
 
The first question that requires determination is whether 
cheques given as security (or as “guarantee”, as sometimes described) would 
attract section 489-F PPC if they are returned unpaid. These cheques may 
bear the same date as the execution date or be post-dated or inchoate 
instruments.1 The general rule is that the cheques, which are not intended to 
settle any specific transaction but to foster trust between the parties in their 
usual business operations, are not susceptible to criminal prosecution under 
section 489-F PPC.2 This issue was raised before the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan for the first time in Mian Allah Ditta v. The State and others  
(2013 SCMR 51). In that case, the Investigating Officer informed the Court 
that during the investigation, he found that the parties had a dispute, which 
they agreed to resolve through arbitration. The arbitrator took the cheque 
from the accused as security before initiating the proceedings, and the sum 
written on it was never adjudicated against him. The Supreme Court 
observed that if the cheque was not issued to repay an outstanding loan or 
fulfilment of an existing obligation but to meet a prospective future liability 
                                          
1 See section 21 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. 
2 Malik Safdar Ali v. Syed Khalid Ali and others (PLD 2012 Sindh 464).

that may be determined as a result of another exercise, then one of the key 
elements of section 489-F PPC is lacking. Given the facts of the case, the 
Supreme Court held that the cheque in question was furnished as security 
and admitted the accused to pre-arrest bail. However, it avoided detailed 
deliberation on the issue “lest it may prejudice anyone during investigation 
or trial.” 
11. 
 
In India, section 138 of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act, 
1881 (the “INI Act”) criminalizes dishonour of cheques.3 The Indian 
Supreme Court has considered the issue of whether dishonour of post-dated 
and security cheques entails criminal liability in various cases. In Indus 
Airways 
Private 
Limited 
v 
Magnum 
Aviation 
Private 
Limited  
[(2014) 12 SCC 539], the purchaser delivered post-dated cheques as advance 
payment against a purchase order that was subsequently cancelled. The 
supplier presented those cheques, but they were not cashed. The Supreme 
Court ruled that section 138 would only apply if a legally enforceable debt 
existed on the “date of the drawl of the cheque.” It further stated that if a 
cheque is issued as an advance payment for the acquisition of goods and the 
purchase order is not carried out to its logical end for any reason, whether 
due to cancellation or otherwise, and the contractor does not supply the 
contract goods, the cheque cannot be said to have been drawn for an existing 
                                          
3 For facility of reference, section 138 of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, is reproduced 
below: 
138. 
Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account.– Where any 
cheque drawn by a person on an account maintained by him with a banker for payment of any 
amount of money to another person from out of that account for the discharge, in whole or in part, 
of any debt or other liability, is returned by the bank unpaid, either because of the amount of 
money standing to the credit of that account is insufficient to honour the cheque or that it exceeds 
the amount arranged to be paid from that account by an agreement made with that bank, such 
person shall be deemed to have committed an offence and shall, without prejudice to any other 
provision of this Act, be punished with imprisonment for a term which may be extended to two 
years, or with fine which may extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or with both: 
Provided that nothing contained in this section shall apply unless– 
(a) 
the cheque has been presented to the bank within a period of six months from 
the date on which it is drawn or within the period of its validity, whichever is 
earlier; 
(b) 
the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque, as the case may be, makes a 
demand for the payment of the said amount of money by giving a notice in 
writing to the drawer of the cheque within thirty days of the receipt of 
information by him from the bank regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid; 
and 
(c) 
the drawer of such cheque fails to make the payment of the said amount of 
money to the payee or, as the case may be, to the holder in due course of the 
cheque within fifteen days of the receipt of the said notice. 
Explanation.– For the purposes of this section, “debt or other liability” means a legally enforceable debt or 
other liability.

debt or liability. In Sampelly Satyanarayana Rao v. Indian Renewable 
Energy Development Agency Limited [(2016) 10 SCC 458 : AIR 2016 SC 
4363], the respondent advanced a loan to the appellant to set up a power 
project for whose repayment he gave it post-dated cheques, describing them 
as security. These cheques were dishonoured, prompting a complaint under 
section 138 of INI Act. The Supreme Court held that whether a post-dated 
cheque is for “discharge of debt or liability” depends on the nature of the 
transaction. Section 138 only applies if, on the date of the cheque, the 
liability or debt exists or the amount has been legally recoverable. The 
Supreme Court distinguished Indus Airways, supra, noting that the said 
decision cannot be applied to a situation where the cheque was for 
repayment of a loan instalment which had fallen due, even though such 
deposit of cheques towards repayment of instalments was also described as 
“security” in the loan agreement. There is a distinction between a transaction 
where the purchase order is cancelled, and a loan transaction in which the 
loan has been advanced and repayment is due on the cheque date. The 
critical question in determining the applicability of section 138 INI Act is 
whether the cheque represents the discharge of existing enforceable debt or 
liability or an advance payment without subsisting debt or liability. 
12. 
 
In Sripati Singh (since deceased) v. State of Jharkhand and 
another (AIR 2021 SC 5732), a Magistrate’s order taking cognizance and 
issuing summons on a complaint under section 420 IPC4 and section 138 of 
INI Act was challenged. There was a transaction in which the appellant had 
advanced funds. Several cheques were given to it but they were all returned 
unpaid. The Indian Supreme Court ruled that “security” refers to something 
given, deposited or pledged to ensure that the parties to a transaction fulfil 
their obligations. If a cheque is furnished as security for a loan, and if the 
loan is not repaid before the due date, or if the parties do not agree to defer 
the payment, the cheque will mature for presentation. If it is not honoured, 
the consequences outlined in section 138 and the other provisions of the INI 
Act will apply. The Supreme Court pointed out that when a cheque is given 
as security for repayment of a loan or an instalment of a loan, it cannot be 
presented before it becomes due. The borrower can repay the loan amount or

the financial liability in any other form. If he settles the liability within the 
agreed period, the cheque issued as security cannot be presented. Hence, 
there cannot be a hard and fast rule that a security cheque can never be 
presented. The Indian Supreme Court further said: 
“When a cheque is issued even though as ‘security’ the consequence 
flowing therefrom is also known to the drawer of the cheque and in the 
circumstance stated above if the cheque is presented and dishonoured, the 
holder of the cheque/drawee would have the option of initiating the civil 
proceedings for recovery or the criminal proceedings for punishment … it 
is not for the drawer of the cheque to dictate terms with regard to the 
nature of litigation.” 
13. 
 
In Sunil Todi v. The State of Gujarat (AIR 2022 SC 147), the 
company issued the respondent a Letter of Intent to provide an uninterrupted 
power supply for which all payments were to be made within 60 days. 
Following that, the company sent an e-mail stating that the security for the 
dues would be a cheque for an amount equal to the quantum of energy 
scheduled for forty-five days. The company subsequently issued two 
cheques “only for security deposit” to be deposited “after getting 
confirmation only”. The company terminated the agreement whereafter the 
respondent presented the cheques for payment. The Supreme Court held that 
the INI Act’s object is to increase the acceptability of cheques and inspire 
trust in the usefulness of negotiable instruments for business transactions. If 
the provision is interpreted to exclude situations in which debt is incurred 
after the cheque is drawn but before it is encashed, the clause’s purpose 
becomes obtuse. The Supreme Court further stated that the true purpose of 
section 138 would not be fulfilled if “debt or other liability” is interpreted to 
include only a debt that exists as on the date of drawing of the cheque.  
Parliament has used the expression “debt or other liability”, which consists 
of two different terms having their own meaning. The expression “or other 
liability” is broader than “a debt” and the two cannot be equated. A cheque 
may be issued to facilitate a commercial transaction between the parties. 
Where, based on the underlying objective, a commercial relationship 
between the parties has been fructified, as in the present case by the supply 
of electricity, the drawer would consider the cheque’s presentation upon the 
buyer’s failure to pay. In other words, the cheque would mature for 
presentation and, in substance and effect, would be for a legally enforceable 
debt or liability.

14. 
 
In Dashrathbhai Trikambhai Patel v. Hitesh Mahendrabhai 
Patel and others (AIR 2022 SC 4961), the appellant lent money to the 
respondent against the security of two cheques, which were dishonoured. 
The trial court acquitted the respondent of an offence under section 138 of 
INI Act because he had partly discharged his liability against those cheques 
before the appellant presented them for encashment. Consequently, as on the 
date of presentation, the amount payable to the appellant was less than the 
amount shown on the cheque. The question arose as to whether section 138 
could still be invoked. The Indian Supreme Court held: 
“(i) 
For the commission of an offence under section 138, the cheque 
that is dishonoured must represent a legally enforceable debt on the date of 
maturity or presentation; 
(ii) 
If the drawer of the cheque pays a part or whole of the sum 
between the period when the cheque is drawn and when it is encashed 
upon maturity, then the legally enforceable debt on the date of maturity 
would not be the sum represented on the cheque; 
(iii) 
When a part or whole of the sum represented on the cheque is paid 
by the drawer of the cheque, it must be endorsed on the cheque as 
prescribed in section 56 of the [INI] Act. The cheque endorsed with the 
payment made may be used to negotiate the balance, if any. If the cheque 
that is endorsed is dishonoured when it is sought to be encashed upon 
maturity, then the offence under section 138 will stand attracted; 
(iv) 
The first respondent has made part-payments after the debt was 
incurred and before the cheque was encashed upon maturity. The sum of 
rupees twenty lakhs represented on the cheque was not the ‘legally 
enforceable debt’ on the date of maturity. Thus, the first respondent cannot 
be deemed to have committed an offence under section 138 of the [INI] 
Act when the cheque was dishonoured for insufficient funds.” 
15. 
 
The Indian courts have interpreted the phrase “discharge of debt 
or liability” in section 138 of INI Act in light of the Explanation given in it. 
The expression “repayment of a loan or fulfilment of an obligation” in 
section 489-F PPC somewhat carries the same meaning. Nonetheless, there 
is a subtle difference between the two sections. The INI Act makes 
dishonour of a cheque a strict liability offence, while mens rea is the 
fundamental component of the offence under section 489-F PPC, which is 
signified by the word “dishonestly”. 
16. 
 
Dishonesty is “to act without honesty”. It is used to describe a 
lack of integrity, cheating, lying, or deliberately withholding information or 
being intentionally deceptive, knave, perfidious, corrupt or treacherous.5

Writ Petition No. 3103/2023

“Dishonesty” is something which laymen can easily see.6 In this sense, it is 
distinguishable from “fraud” which seems to involve technicalities that a 
lawyer must explain.7 Dishonesty provides the mens rea for a range of 
offences under statute and the common law. In Ivey v. Genting Casinos 
(UK) Ltd. t/a Crockfords [2017] UKSC 67, Lord Hughes stated: 
“Where it applies as an element of a criminal charge, dishonesty is by no 
means a defined concept. On the contrary, like the elephant, it is 
characterised more by recognition when encountered than by definition. 
Dishonesty is not a matter of law but a jury question of fact and standards. 
Except to the limited extent that section 2 of the Theft Act 1968 requires 
otherwise, judges do not, and must not, attempt to define it: R v Feely 
[1973] QB 530. In this, it differs strikingly from the expression 
“fraudulently”, which it largely replaced, for the judge did define whether 
a state of mind, once ascertained as a matter of fact, was or was not 
fraudulent: R v Williams [1953] 1 QB 660 ... When dishonesty is in 
question, the fact-finding tribunal must first ascertain (subjectively) the 
actual state of the individual’s knowledge or belief as to the facts. The 
reasonableness or otherwise of his belief is a matter of evidence (often in 
practice determinative) going to whether he held the belief, but it is not an 
additional requirement that his belief must be reasonable; the question is 
whether it is genuinely held. When once his actual state of mind as to 
knowledge or belief as to facts is established, the question whether his 
conduct was honest or dishonest is to be determined by the fact-finder by 
applying the (objective) standards of ordinary decent people. There is no 
requirement that the defendant must appreciate that what he has done is, 
by those standards, dishonest.” 
17. 
 
Section 24 PPC states that “whoever does anything with the 
intention of causing wrongful gain to one person or wrongful loss to another 
person, is said to do that thing ‘dishonestly’.” Thus, issuing a cheque and its 
subsequent dishonour does not ipso facto attract section 489-F PPC. The 
drawer’s dishonesty must also be established,8 and for that purpose, every 
transaction must be carefully scrutinized.9 In Ahmed Shakeel Bhatti and 
others v. The State and others (2023 SCMR 1), the complainant sought 
cancellation of the pre-arrest bail of the accused, alleging a lack of 
commercial integrity. The Supreme Court of Pakistan dismissed his 
application inter alia with the following observations: 
“… commercial integrity is an ethical standard which would require 
evidence for establishing its absence in the conduct of an accused to a 
degree that constitutes dishonesty by him within the meaning of section 
489-F PPC. In the facts of the present case, such an assessment can be

made at the trial to evaluate whether any improper benefit, if at all, has 
been derived by the respondent on account of the stoppage of payment of 
his cheque which was wrongful. This aspect of the matter cannot be 
determined at the bail stage in the present case. As dishonesty is an 
ingredient of the offence under section 489-F of the PPC, therefore, the 
cancellation of pre-arrest bail can be ordered in the instant case if the 
element of dishonesty is presently indicated from the conduct of the 
respondent. Evidentiary material to such effect is lacking on record at the 
present stage. Indeed, if evidence on the point is brought at the trial, the 
finding thereon will depend on the significance and materiality of the 
obligation claimed by the respondent to have been breached by the 
petitioner under the terms of the bargain between the parties.” 
18. 
 
The general concept of criminal law is that actus reus and  
mens rea, as necessary elements of an offence, must coincide in time. This is 
known as the contemporaneity rule or the coincidence principle. However, 
courts frequently take a flexible approach while interpreting this 
synchronicity requirement, or as some would say, make exceptions to it.10  
As a result, “one-transaction theory” and “the continuing act theory" have 
emerged. The former postulates that having the mens rea for the crime at 
some point during a series of acts is sufficient.11 On the other hand, the 
continuing act theory holds that a person can be guilty of an offence if he 
forms the mens rea at some point while the actus reus is still taking place.12 
If the threshold requirement that the cheque was issued towards repayment 
of a loan or fulfilment of an obligation is met, the “one-transaction theory” 
or the “continuing act theory” may be used to superimpose the mens rea 
element of dishonesty in determining whether criminal liability is attracted 
under section 489-F PPC. 
19. 
 
Post-dated cheques may be classified into three broad 
categories: (a) cheques issued to discharge a liability that has already 
accrued or that is determined and would accrue on a specific date;  
(b) cheques issued to satisfy a future liability which may or may not occur; 
and (c) cheques provided for the payee’s comfort under an express 
agreement and are not the product of any specific transaction. Criminal 
liability under section 489-F PPC generally arises only in respect of the 
cheques falling in category (a) unless the one-transaction or the continuing 
act theory can be applied.

In view of what has been discussed above, the proposition that 
all security cheques fall beyond the purview of section 489-F PPC is too 
broad to be accepted. Nevertheless, I may highlight two points. First, the 
plea that the cheque was given as security constitutes an accused’s defence. 
It is a question of fact which is determined by the evidence gathered during 
an investigation or produced at the trial. Hence, the accused cannot petition 
under Article 199 of the Constitution for quashing of FIR on this ground 
unless the factual aspects of the matter are admitted between the parties. 
Second, civil liability for dishonour of a cheque differs from criminal 
liability. They each have their own criteria and are not dependent on one 
another. Civil responsibility is determined by applying the principles of civil 
law. 
21. 
 
Let’s now turn to the case at hand. In its application under 
section 22-A Cr.P.C. before the Ex-officio Justice of Peace, the Petitioner 
stated that it did business with Apex and Rs.15.00 million became 
outstanding against it over time. Apex’s directors, Respondents No.1 & 2, 
issued Cheque Nos. 97479699, 1688258316 and CA-0053594927 for 
Rs.5.00 million each to settle the liability, but these were dishonoured on 
presentation. However, as adumbrated, the Petitioner’s pleadings before this 
Court, particularly paragraphs 1(b), 2 and 3, indicate that it received the said 
cheques as security under the Distribution Agreement. Respondents No.1 & 
2 have submitted documents proving this reality. Most importantly, the 
Petitioner admits them. Since the Petitioner’s plea, which it took in the 
application under section 22-A Cr.P.C. is negated, this petition is liable to be 
dismissed on this short ground.

Admittedly, the Petitioner and Apex never settled their 
accounts. There is a dispute between the two, and the latter has a claim 
against it for Rs.100,439,515/-, which is currently under litigation. As per 
record, Respondent No.1 issued Cheque No. 97479699 on 13.5.2019, while 
Respondent No.2 issued Cheque Nos. CA-0053594927 and 1688258316 on 
25.1.2020 and 2.7.2020, respectively. There was no final liability of Apex on 
those dates or when the Petitioner presented them. These cheques are also 
not the outcome of any specific transaction.

True, clause 15.5 of the Distribution Agreement allows the 
Petitioner to pursue both criminal and civil proceedings for the dishonour of 
cheques, but that is subject to the law. It must demonstrate that the 
requirements of section 489-F PPC are met before it can begin proceedings 
thereunder and prosecute Respondents No.1 & 2. These are conspicuously 
missing in the present case.  
24. 
 
The learned counsel for the Petitioner has failed to point out 
jurisdictional defects or other legal infirmities in the Impugned Order dated 
21.11.2022 which may call for interference by this Court. This petition has 
no merit and is, therefore, dismissed.
