Sh. Imran Mohammad Naeem, Advocate for the 
Appellant. 
 
 
This appeal in terms of Section 22 of the Financial 
Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance, 2001 
(hereinafter to be referred as the “Ordinance”) arising out 
of execution proceedings calls in question the vires of 
order dated 13.03.2023 whereby learned Judge Banking 
Court-VI, Lahore (the “Banking Court”) proceeded to 
dismiss the application filed by the Appellant. She also 
challenges order dated 09.02.2023 regarding fixation of 
reserve price of the mortgaged property.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the Appellant inter alia 
submitted that the Banking Court has not taken into 
consideration the true facts and circumstances of the case 
while dismissing the application of the Appellant; that the 
Banking Court has not taken into consideration the fact 
that value of the mortgaged property sought to be 
auctioned is much more than what has been assessed by 
the Masud Associates Pvt. Limited i.e. assessed market 
value as Rs.50,276,563/- and forced sale value as 
Rs.40,221,250/-; that the Appellant has got the mortgaged 
property evaluated from Diamond Surveyors Pakistan

which has assessed the market value thereof to be 
Rs.151,650,000/- 
and 
forced

value 
as 
Rs.128,902,500/-.  
3. 
We have heard the arguments and perused the 
record.  
4. 
It evinces from the record that an independent 
evaluator namely “Masud Associates Pvt Limited” (the “ 
“Evaluator”) was appointed by the “Banking Court” vide 
order dated 20.01.2023. Vide order dated 27.01.2023, the 
“Banking Court” directed the court auctioneer to contact 
the “Evaluator” to submit valuation report which he did 
on 03.02.2023 and vide the same order, the Appellant was 
provided an opportunity to file objections, if any, but she 
did not file and consequently, the “Banking Court” vide 
order dated 09.02.2023 fixed the reserved price of the 
mortgaged property in terms of the report of the 
“Evaluator” and where after the present application 
challenging the report was filed by the Appellant. The 
record does not show that at the time of filing this report, 
the Appellant has ever filed an objection while the 
“Banking Court” in order dated 13.03.2023 observed that 
“an opportunity was given to the judgment debtor for 
submission of objection on the valuation report but the 
judgment debtor has not filed the objection at that time 
and reserve price was fixed on 09.02.2023. The judgment 
debtor filed the objection petition at belated stage just to 
linger on execution proceedings”. Admittedly, execution 
proceedings are underway since year 2014 and the 
Appellant was well aware about it but she knowingly did 
not file objections at the relevant time rather the same were 
filed belatedly on 18.03.2023 as is evident from the order 
sheet attached with record so she is estopped from her own

conduct. The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the 
case of “Dr. MUHAMMAD JAVAID SHAFI Versus Syed 
RASHID ARSHAD and others” (PLD 2015 SC 212) has 
held that “a person was estopped by his own conduct, if he 
though was aware of certain fact(s), which was likely to 
cause harm to his rights and adversely affect him and was 
prejudicial against him, avowedly or through some 
conspicuous act or by omission, intentionally permitted 
and allowed another person to believe a thing to be true 
and act on such belief without taking any steps to 
controvert or nullify such adverse fact and instead he slept 
over the matter. Such waiver or estoppel may arise from 
mere silence or inaction or even inconsistent conduct of a 
person”. 
5. 
The counsel for the Appellant strenuously argued 
before us about fixation of reserve price by the “Banking 
Court” on lesser side based on report submitted by the 
“Evaluator”. It is pertinent to mention here that the 
amendment brought about by Lahore High Court in Order 
XXI Rule 66 CPC, which added a proviso to sub-rule 2 (e). 
It reads as under: 
“Provided that it shall not be 
necessary for the court itself to give 
its own estimate of the value of the 
property; but the proclamation shall 
include the estimate, if any, given by 
either or both of the parties”. 
 
6 
Pertinently, fixing the value of the property is a 
matter of opinion, and the Court cannot give its opinion on 
such a point. It appears that the object of the above proviso 
is to relieve the Court from the burden of affirming the 
accuracy of the value of the property shown in the 
proclamation of sale and to enable the prospective

           4 
purchaser to form his own opinion relying upon the 
estimates given by the parties. After all, Order XXI Rule 
66 (2) (e) CPC stipulates that the proclamation shall 
contain every other thing which the Court considers 
material for a purchaser to know in order to judge the 
nature and value of the property. Notwithstanding the 
afore-mentioned provision, with the availability and 
benefit of the evaluation reports from the PBA approved 
evaluators, the Courts do fix the reserve price of the 
properties being put to auction on the basis of the value 
placed therein. In the case in hand, the Appellant, while 
relying upon her evaluation report, has invited this Court 
to disregard the report prepared by the “Evaluator”. The 
contention so raised cannot be accepted. The fact that the 
evaluation report prepared under the instructions of the 
Appellant places higher price of the mortgaged property 
than the evaluation report, which the “Evaluator” 
prepared under the directions of the “Banking Court”, 
should not form basis for rejecting the latter report. The 
preference would always be given to evaluation report 
prepared under the orders of the Courts rather than a report 
which is prepared at the behest of a judgment debtor. In 
this case, the reserve price was fixed by the “Banking 
Court” based on the report of “Evaluator” hence it 
ensures reasonableness, fairness and otherwise promotes 
transparency whereas mere bald assertion of inadequacy of 
reserve price fixed by a private evaluator not appointed by 
the Court is per se no ground to re-fix the reserve price 
especially when no substantial injury was otherwise 
caused. Reliance is placed on “AL-HADI RICE MILLS 
(PVT.) LTD through Chief Executive and 4 others Versus 
MCB BANK LIMITED and 6 others” (2023 CLD 85). It is 

 
 
 
 
E.F.A.No.20277 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
           5 
not uncommon for the judgment debtors to prepare the 
evaluation report showing exaggerated value of the 
mortgaged properties in order to delay and frustrate the 
auction process. It may again be emphasized that 
evaluation report by the “Evaluator” was prepared under 
the orders of the “Banking Court” and, therefore, the 
selection is not between the evaluation reports of the 
contesting purchasers that the Court is merely accepting 
the value placed by one side as ipse dixit. It must also be 
kept in mind that determination of the value of any 
property is always subjective and opinions in this regard 
differ. The consistent view expressed by the Courts that 
the reserve price of a property is always based on a 
tentative estimate, therefore, appears to be correct. 
Notwithstanding the concern of the Courts to balance out 
the interests of both the judgment debtor as well as the 
decree holder, a transparent auction which is well 
advertised with competitors taking part in the bidding 
process is itself the biggest safeguard against collusion 
amongst the bidders and shall ensure that the final price 
received will largely be independent of the reserve price 
and reflect the best price that the property can obtain. 
Objections of such nature by the judgment debtors are 
always meant to delay the process of auction. Nothing 
stops a judgment debtor to locate and bring forward a 
buyer of his choice either in the auction or before the Court 
prior to the sale if the property is being sold for a price 
which in the estimation of the judgment debtor is on the 
lower side. For this very purpose Rule 83 Order 21 CPC 
has been enacted under which Court sales can be 
postponed to enable a judgment debtor for raising money 
through private sale of the property. A judgment debtor 

 
 
 
 
E.F.A.No.20277 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
           6 
cannot be allowed to derail the auction process by 
submitting evaluation report prepared at his instance 
instead of arranging a buyer for the properties to be 
auctioned. It may further be added that the condition of 
confirmation of sale by the court also operates as a biggest 
safeguard against the property which has been sold at 
inadequate price irrespective of the fact whether any 
irregularity or fraud in the conduct of the sale has been 
committed or not.   
7. 
We, therefore, fully agree with the findings of the 
Banking Court which rightly dismissed the application of 
the Appellant and do not see any illegality or perversity in 
the impugned orders which have been passed strictly in 
accordance with law, as such do not warrant any 
interference by us. Since the appeal is at limine stage and it 
can be dismissed by applying doctrine of “Limine Control” 
in the light of case “M/s COLONY TEXTILE MILLS 
LIMITED 
and 
another 
Versus 
FIRST 
PUNJAB 
MODARABA” (2021 CLD 1212). Consequently, the 
Appeal in hand, being devoid of any merit, is hereby 
dismissed in limine.
