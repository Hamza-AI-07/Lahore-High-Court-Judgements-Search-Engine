Brief facts of these writ petitions are that land 
measuring 230-Kanals 08-Marlas situated in village Amin 
Kot, Tehsil Depalpur, District Okara was resumed from the

different persons before the Land Commissioner who vide

applications on the prescribed forms before the Deputy Land 
Commissioner, Okara for allotment of the surrendered land 
and further directed to decide the same in accordance with 
law as per provisions of Paragraph 18(3) of MLR-115/1972. 
 
Muhammad Ali alias Mumma etc., challenged the said 
order through revision petitions before the Chief Land 
Commissioner, Punjab, who vide order dated 12.09.2000 
accepted the petitions and remanded the matter to the Deputy 
Land Commissioner, Okara to decide the matter afresh with 
the direction that allotment should be made after due

The said order was challenged through revision petitions

that Muhammad Yousaf etc., were not tenants of any 
landowner during crucial crops i.e. Kharif 1971 and Rabi 
1972, rather their names have been entered in Girdawari 
register by way of forgery and the names of tenants were 
incorporated on the basis of so called girdawari. He held that 
the matter needs to be probed thoroughly and thus he by 
setting aside the order dated 27.03.2002 of the Deputy Land 
Commissioner, Okara remanded back the matter to him with 
the direction to make thorough inquiry and then pass order as

4.  
Submitted please. 
Assistant Commissioner/ 
Collector Sub-Division, 
Depalpur” 
 
The above said report has not been challenged or got 
reversed by any party and the said report has attained status 
of finality, thus, as per notification dated 12th December, 
1972 Martial Law Regulation No.115 the property which is 
situated within prohibited zone as provided in the Colonies 
Department’s Circular memorandum No.3024-72/3946-CL-
III dated 12th December, 1972 cannot be permanently allotted 
under Paragraph 18(3) of Martial Law Regulation 115. For 
ready reference, said notification is reproduced as under:- 
“Letter No. ASR-11-3456-73/2687-LC (II), dated the 
5th July, 1973, from the Secretary, Punjab Land 
Commission, to all Deputy Land Commissioners and 
Land Commissioners. 
SUBJECT:- 
AREA AROUND LARGE TOWNS 
RESUMED UNDER MARTIAL LAW 
REGULATION 115. 
 
I am directed to state that certain areas around 
large towns have been resumed under Martial Law 
Regulation 115 which are reported to be untenanted. A 
question has arisen whether such areas should be 
allotted under paragraph 18 (3) of Martial Law 

Writ Petition No.254943/2018 
6 
 
Regulation 115. Since these areas are very valuable and 
are likely to be required for extension of abadis or public 
purposes etc., it has been decided that all areas resumed 
under Martial Law Regulation 115 which are untenanted 
and fall within the prohibited zones as given in the 
Colonies Department's Circular memorandum No. 3024-
72/3946-CL-III, dated the 12th December, 1972 and 
noted below shall not be permanently allotted under 
paragraph 18 (3) of Martial Law Regulation 115 but 
shall be kept in reserve for extension of abadis and other 
public purposes etc. 
2. 
The following is the limit for prohibited zones:- 
In the case of  -  
1. 
 Corporations. = 
  
10
 
miles from the outer 
 
 
 
 
 
limits of the Corporation. 
 
2. 
 First Class Municipal = 
5  miles from the outer  
Committees. 
limits of the Municipal 
Committee. 
 
3. 
Second Class  = 
 
3 miles from the outer 
Municipal Committees. 
limits of the Municipal  
Committee. 
 
4. 
Town Committees. =   
2  miles from the outer  
limits 
of 
the 
Town 
Committee. 
 
5. 
Railway Stations.   =   
1  mile from the outer  
limits of the Railway 
Station. 
 
In the case of Cantonment Boards the prohibited zone 
shall tally with the limit prescribed for the local body to which 
they are adjacent, e.g. the limit of the prohibited zone in the 
case of Lahore Cantonment Board will be the same as that 
prescribed for the Lahore Corporation and the limit for the 
Cantonment Board, Multan, will be the same as fixed for the 
Municipal Committee, Multan-and so on.” 
 
 
 
    
     (emphasis supplied)  
 
The term “outer limits” means the piece of land which starts 
from the end point/boundary of territorial limits a municipal 
committee/corporation etc. In the instant case, the limit of 
“prohibited zone” as per the notification reproduced above, is 
regarding the land stretched till 05 miles from the “outer 
limits” of municipal committee. The main reason for 
imposition of ban on allotment/grant of proprietary rights of 

Writ Petition No.254943/2018 
7 
 
the state land falling in prohibited zone is to cater the present 
and future needs of the local population as well as for the use 
of other different public purposes. As per the report 
reproduce above, the land in question is situated about 07 
KM away from Municipal Committee Haveli-Lakha District 
Okara. In the aforesaid notification, the limit of “05 miles 
from the outer limits of Municipal Committee” has been 
prescribed, which distance while measuring in Kilometers 
comes to 8.05 KMs [as 01 Mile = 1.609 KM] whereas as per 
the aforesaid report of the Assistant Commissioner, the land 
in question is situated at the distance of only 07 KM away 
from the above said Municipal Committee which is within 
prohibited zone. Thus, the land in question is situated within 
the “prohibited zone” as such the authorities are debarred to 
make any allotment of said land. An alike controversy qua 
the allotment of land situated within prohibited zone has 
been considered and declined by this Court in its judgment 
cited as Muhammad Israfeel & Others Vs. The Province of 
Punjab & Others (2021 MLD 313). The order passed in 
supra judgment was challenged in Intra Court Appeal 
(No.37127-2020) as well as a subsequent ICA No.85/2021 
titled as Mushtaq Ahmad etc. Vs The Province of Punjab etc. 
along-with other connected ICAs and same were also stood 
dismissed. Further on 05.10.2021 another Writ Petition 
[No.57766/2021] was also dismissed on analogy of the 
aforementioned judgment [2021 MLD 313] which order of 

Writ Petition No.254943/2018 
8 
 
dismissal was assailed before the Apex Court who while 
dismissing Civil Petition No.1925-L/ 2021 on 25.08.2022 
upheld the order of this Court. Thus the bar on the allotment 
of state land falling in prohibited zone has attained finality 
and all the state functionaries are under bounded obligation 
to comply with dictates of the Hon’ble Superior Court of 
law.   
  
But the respondent-authorities have not considered 
command of the aforementioned notification as well as the 
law on the subject while deciding the matter in issue as such 
the orders of the allotment of land falling within the 
prohibited zone were passed in clear violation of the 
aforementioned notification as well as the law on the subject. 
Thus there is no hesitation to hold that allotments of the 
surrendered state land falling within the prohibited zone are 
patently illegal and liable to be set aside. 
6. 
Moreover the Courts of law are custodian of the public 
properties, assets or interest and while dealing with matters 
relating to such properties/assets or interests, it is inalienable 
obligation of the courts to be very careful, cautious and 
assure itself to the extent of certainty that no mischief is 
being played with the state assets. An extraordinary 
obligation is placed upon the courts to keep abreast itself 
with law and facts of the case and when certain material facts 
unearthed before it then the matter should be decided as per law 

Writ Petition No.254943/2018 
9 
 
even without being influenced by respective pleadings of the 
parties. In this regard, reliance is placed on judgments cited as 
Al-Shafique Housing Society Vs. P.M.A (PLD 1992 SC 113), 
Provincial Government through Collector, Kohat and another 
Versus Shabbir Hussain (PLD 2005 SC 337) and Abdul Haq 
Indher Vs. Province of Sindh (2007 SCMR 907). 
7. 
For what has been discussed above, the orders passed 
by the Land Commissioner, Deputy Land Commissioner, 
Chief Land Commissioner as well as Federal Land 
Commission, Islamabad regarding allotment of land in 
question in favour of any party either the petitioners or the 
other side, are hereby set aside in toto by declaring that land 
in question, being situated within the limits of prohibited 
zone cannot be allotted permanently to any person or tenant. 
8. 
Resultantly, all these writ petitions are allowed 
accordingly. If either party of the case is in possession of the 
land in question, the District Collector, Okara is directed to 
retrieve the same and also recover Tawan as per law.
