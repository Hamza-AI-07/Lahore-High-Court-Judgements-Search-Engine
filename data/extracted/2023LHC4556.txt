Date of hearing:    03.05.2023. 
Petitioners by: 
M/s Sheikh Naveed Shahryar and Uneza 
Siddique, Advocates.  
Respondents  
No.2 & 3 by: 
Mr. Ahsan Shahzad, Advocate. 
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.: This 
consolidated judgment shall also decide connected petition i.e. 
W.P.No.12268 of 2022 as common questions of law and facts are 
involved in these cases.  
2. 
Through these petitions, petitioners have assailed orders 
dated 12.02.2022 & 22.02.2022, passed by learned Civil Judge, 
Bhera and Additional District Judge, Bhalwal, respectively, 
whereby petitioners’ applications under Order  I Rule 10 CPC and 
under Order VI Rule 17 CPC for impleadment and for amendment 
in plaint, were concurrently dismissed.  
3. 
Necessary facts of the case are that petitioners filed suits for 
declaration along with permanent injunction against respondents 
No.1 to 3, which were contested by them by way of filing written 
statements. During the course of proceedings, petitioners filed 
applications under Order I Rule 10 CPC and Order VI Rule 17 
C.P.C. for impleadment and subsequent amendment in the plaint. 
The said applications were contested by respondents No.2 & 3 by 
filing written replies.  Learned Trial Court, after hearing arguments 
of learned counsel for the parties, vide orders dated 12.02.2022, 

2 
Writ Petition No.12264 of 2022 & connected case 
dismissed said applications. Feeling aggrieved, petitioners filed 
revision petitions before learned Additional District Judge, which 
were dismissed vide orders dated 22.02.2022. Hence, these 
petitions. 
4. 
Learned counsel for petitioners submits that fraud and 
fabrication has been committed in registration of general power of 
attorneys dated 05.02.1987 & 11.01.1994, registered by the Sub-
Registrar, Lahore, therefore, impleadment of revenue officers / 
officials is necessary for just conclusion of the lis. He further 
submits that mere impleadment of the said officers / officials in the 
array of defendants and subsequent amendment in the plaint would 
not change the nature and complexion of the suits, however, learned 
forums below have dismissed petitioners’ applications without any 
lawful justification. In the end, he has relied upon Haji Kadir Bux v. 
Province of SIND and another (PLJ 1982 Supreme Court 373) 
and Gulistan Textile Mills Ltd. and another v. Soneri Bank Ltd. and 
another (PLD 2018 Supreme Court 322).  
5. 
On the other hand, learned Law Officer and learned counsel 
for respondents defend the impugned orders by contending that it is 
not necessary that the revenue officers / officials are required to be 
impleaded as party in each and every case.  
6. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused. 
7. 
Record shows that petitioner (Fatima Noon) filed suit for 
declaration along with permanent injunction calling into question 
the genuineness and legality of general power of attorney bearing 
No.267-4 dated 11.01.1994 shown to have been executed by the 
petitioner in favour of respondent No.1 (attested by Sub-Registrar, 
Lahore), and the subsequent mutations. Whereas, the suit on behalf 
of petitioner (Aalia Malik), with the alike prayer, is regarding 
general power of attorney No.900 dated 05.02.1987. During 
pendency of the suits, petitioners filed applications under Order I 
Rule 10 CPC and under Order VI Rule 17 CPC for impleadment of: 
(1) Province of Punjab through District Collector, Sargodha, (2) 

3 
Writ Petition No.12264 of 2022 & connected case 
Sub-Registrar, Lahore, and (3) Revenue Officer of concerned 
Halqa, in the array of defendants as defendants No.4 to 6, 
respectively; and for subsequent amendments to this effect in the 
headnote of the plaints and at the end of certain paras. 
8. 
Undeniably, impleading the revenue officials in every case 
is not a rule of universal application rather depends upon the 
peculiar facts and circumstances of each case. If the Court finds 
that impleadment of revenue functionaries is necessary for just 
decision, it can pass appropriate orders. They can also be 
summoned by either side or if considered necessary even as 
Court witnesses. It is notable that when connivance of the 
revenue officials with the defendant(s) in attesting any mutation 
is alleged in civil suit, the Province of the Punjab as well as the 
revenue officials against whom the connivance for attestation of 
the mutation is alleged, are the necessary party because no valid 
adjudication can be carried out and no finding can be recorded 
against them in their absence. In the instant case, from the 
contents of applications for impleadment it is not discernible that 
connivance of revenue officials in registration of power of 
attorney in favour of respondent No.1 is specifically alleged by 
the petitioners, therefore, learned Courts below have rightly 
rejected the request. Reference can be made to Sikandar Hayat 
and another v. Sughran Bibi and 6 others (2020 SCMR 214) and 
Ghulam Muhammad v. Zohran Bibi and others (2021 SCMR 19). 
 
As regards petitioner’s application for amendment, it suffices 
it to say that when revenue officials are not necessary party to the 
lis, the proposed amendments being ancillary in nature are also not 
tenable, as rightly observed by learned Courts below.  
9. 
Even otherwise, respondents are beneficiaries of registered 
power of attorney and subsequent mutations, therefore, under well-
established principle of law, burden to prove genuineness of 
aforesaid documents lies on respondents in the light of law laid 
down in the cases reported as Muhammad Nazir v. Khurshid Begum 

4 
Writ Petition No.12264 of 2022 & connected case 
(2005 SCMR 941), Abdul Ghafoor and others v. Mukhtar Ahmad 
Khan and others (2006 SCMR 1144), Abdul Rehman and others v. 
Ghulam Muhammad through L.Rs. and others (2010 SCMR 978), 
Khan Muhammad v. Muhammad Din through LRs (2010 SCMR 
1351), Khaliqdad Khan and others v. Mst. Zeenat Khatoon and 
others (2010 SCMR 1370), Amjad Ikram v. Mst. Asiya Kausar and 
2 others (2015 SCMR 1) and Phul Peer Shah v. Hafeez Fatima 
(2016 SCMR 1225). 
 
The case law cited by learned counsel for petitioners is 
distinguishable and not applicable to facts and circumstances of 
these cases. 
10. 
Learned counsel for petitioners was unable to point out any 
illegality or legal infirmity in the concurrent decisions of learned 
Courts below, which are based upon correct appreciation of law and 
facts, thus, no interference in exercise of constitutional jurisdiction 
is warranted.  
11. 
In view of the above, instant petition, along with connected 
petition, being devoid of merits, is hereby dismissed.
