30.03.2023.     Mr. Muhammad Suleman, Advocate for the 
petitioner. 
 
M/s. Sattar Sahil and Umar Arshad Butt, 
Assistant Advocate General(s) with Usman 
Khalid Khan, Additional Secretary (IS) and 
Irshad Ahmad Section Officer (IS-I) Home 
Department. 
 
Through this constitution petition the petitioner has challenged 
the vires of Order No. RDM/303 dated 21.03.2023 passed by Deputy 
Commissioner, Lahore/respondent No.1, hereinafter called as 
impugned order, by which thirteen persons named in Para-No.3 of this 
petition, have been put under preventive detention. 
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that no material in 
substance was available which could warrant preventive detention of 
the detenus, therefore, respondent No.1 has travelled beyond his 
powers and committed excess while curtailing the liberty of the 
detunes which is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed under the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. Further states 
that on the last date of hearing respondents were directed by this Court 
that if any supportive material has been collected before or after the 
passing of impugned order, the same shall be submitted for inspection 
of this court and detenus were also ordered to be produced pursuant to 
Rule 39 of the Punjab Public Order Detenu Rules, 1979. Contention 
of learned counsel for the petitioner was attended; detenus present 
before the court submit that they were either in their respective houses 
or at work-places when picked up by the police and so for grounds for 
their detention have not been conveyed to them nor they have been 

2 W.P.No.20258.23. 
 
allowed to consult any legal counsel and even their family members 
or relatives were denied access.   
3. 
Mr. Sattar Sahil, the learned Assistant Advocate General 
submits that detenus are political workers and were designing to 
participate in subversive activities through demonstration and protest 
against the sitting regime. Adds that their detention was justified to 
maintain the public order; he has placed reliance on the cases reported 
as “Sheikh MUHAMMAD MUSA versus GOVERNMENT OF EAST PAKISTAN 
AND OTHERS” (1969 P Cr. L J 862) and “PURNENDU DASTIGAR versus 
GOVERNMENT OF EAST PAKISTAN THROUGH THE SECRETR HOME 
(POL.) DEPARTENT AND 2 OTHERS” (1970 P Cr. L J 11).  
4. 
Contrary to above contentions, the learned counsel for the 
petitioner submits that in a case reported as “Federation of Pakistan 
through Secretary, Ministry of Interior Islamabad. v. Mrs. Amtul Jalil 
Khawaja and others” (PLD 2003 SC 442) the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan has laid down the criteria to check the vires of order passed 
for preventive detention and in this case no material is available which 
could pass such threshold. He has further relied on the cases reported 
as “MUHAMMAD IRSHAD versus GOVERNMENT OF THE 
PUNJAB and others” (2020 P Cr. L J 206), “SHAHID RASOOL 
versus GOVERNMENT OF THE PUNJAB through Secretary Home 
Department, Lahore and 6 others” (2023 YLR 333) and 
“MUHAMMAD ABDAAL alias ABDALI versus GOVERNMENT OF 
PUNJAB and others” (PLD 2020 Lahore 471). 
 
5.        It is now known that preventative detention is a controversial 
method of confinement that allows a state to curtail the liberty of a 
person, often under the auspices of national security and the 
maintenance of public order. Particularly during times of war, the 
doctrine of preventative detention operates as a legal go-between of 
sorts. It borrows elements from both humanitarian and criminal law, 
but strictly adheres to neither. Several international legal instruments, 
both binding and non-binding, address what constitute the standards 
arrest and detention. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights 

3 W.P.No.20258.23. 
 
(UDHR), which may be construed as customary international law, 
states, “no one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or 
exile.”  The drafting history of the UDHR indicates that the original 
intention of the drafters was to prohibit arrest and detention that was 
“unlawful.” This is evident in the Drafting Committee’s original 
provision which prohibited arrest and detention “except in cases 
prescribed by law and after due process.” The concept of “unlawful” 
was replaced with “arbitrary” after deliberations that suggested that 
arbitrariness was a broader means of providing protection to 
individuals subject to arrest or detention. The International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) is a binding extension of the 
UDHR. Article 9(1) of the ICCPR conveys the same principle:  
 
“Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one 
shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention. No one shall be 
deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in accordance 
with such procedure as are established by law.” 
 
In her discussion of preventative detention and personal liberty, Claire 
Macken demonstrated that there are two possible interpretations of 
“arbitrary” as follows:  
 
1. An arrest or detention is “arbitrary” if it is purely unlawful and 
not in accordance with procedure as laid down by law;  
 
2. An arrest or detention is “arbitrary” if it is unlawful or unjust, 
which means that in addition to violating the letter of the law, it also 
violates the principles of justice in spirit. 1 
 
The security of person has also been saved through our Constitution 
as per Article-9 which says “No person shall be deprived of life or 
liberty save in accordance with law” 
 
6.       The relevant provision of law for preventive detention for the 
subject case is section 3 of the Punjab Maintenance of Public Order 
Ordinance, relevant part is reproduced as under; 
 
3.   Power to arrest and detain suspected persons. – (1) 
Government, if satisfied that with a view to preventing any person 
from acting in any manner prejudicial to public safety or the 
maintenance of public order, it is necessary so to do, may, by an 
order in  writing, direct  the  arrest and  detention in such custody as  
 
___________ 
1. Research Society of International Law; Preventive-Detention-Maira-Article-ICRC. 

4 W.P.No.20258.23. 
 
 
 
 
may be prescribed under sub-section (7), of such person for such 
period as may, subject to the other provisions of this section, be 
specified in the order, and Government, if satisfied that for the 
aforesaid reasons it is necessary so to do, may extend from time to 
time the period of such detention, for a period not exceeding six 
months at a time. 
 
The purpose of above section is to prevent any person from acting in 
any manner prejudicial to public safety or the maintenance of public 
order. For ascertaining such act, it is essential that some material in 
tangible form should be available. Learned Assistant Advocate 
General states that only a source report is sufficient to prevent 
imminent danger by putting the person in captivity. Executive 
authority no doubt can take action on any source report in rare cases 
but then it becomes mandatory to collect the material to justify 
detention and the minimum period for collection of such material is 
impliedly reflected in section 3 (6) of Ordinance ibid which is as 
under; 
 If a detention order of a person is made under this section, the 
authority making the order: 
(a)  shall, within fifteen days of the detention of the person, 
communicate to the person the grounds on which the order has been 
made, and shall afford the person the earliest opportunity of making 
a representation to the Government against the detention order; 
 
 
Such material should obviously be in tangible form like; SMS/Voice 
messages, Whats app Messages or of other social media accounts, 
Pamphlets/handouts, Posters, Photographs, Paintings, Caricatures, 
Books/Literature, Newspapers, Audio/Video CDs, Electronic and 
Digital material, Wall chalking, Banners/Pena flex, recording of 
demonstrations in Rallies, Material on face book, twitter or any other 
social media account, call records, geofencing through CDR, 
Speeches in Public Meetings , Radio & T.V. shows, Surveillance 
report in any form, Reports from international agencies, Suspicious 
transaction report from any financial institution, membership record 
of affiliated association or political party etc. On collection of such 
material there must be a standard satisfaction of authority for 
necessity to make an order for preventive detention which means that 

5 W.P.No.20258.23. 
 
there must be some reasonable grounds to justify the order. What does 
reasonable grounds mean, it has been laid down by a Division Bench 
of this Court in case titled “Saif ur Rehman vs GOP, etc” (Criminal 
Appeal No.315/2022) decided on 10.01.2023, as under; 
“Reasonable grounds” means  
a set of facts or circumstances which would satisfy an ordinary 
cautious and prudent person that there is reason to believe and 
which goes beyond mere suspicion.  
a suspicion based on reasons that can be articulated. It is more than 
mere hunch or supposition, but much less than the level of proof 
that would be required to impose a disciplinary sanction. 
more than mere suspicion but less than the civil test of balance of 
probabilities. It is a much lower threshold than the criminal standard 
of “beyond reasonable doubt.” It is a bona fide belief in a serious 
possibility based on credible evidence.    
that there must be some supporting information for the suspicion. A 
mere allegation is not enough. Reports must not contain information 
that is known to be untrue.  
information that establishes sufficient articulable facts that give a 
trained law enforcement or criminal investigative agency officer, 
investigator, or employee a reasonable basis to believe that a 
definable criminal activity or enterprise is, has been, or may be 
committed.    
 
7. 
In the case reported as “Federation of Pakistan through 
Secretary, Ministry of Interior Islamabad. v. Mrs. Amtul Jalil 
Khawaja and others” (PLD 2003 SC 442), following criteria has been 
set down by the Supreme Court of Pakistan to check the vires of order 
passed by the authority; 
 
(i) 
the Court must be satisfied that the material before the 
detaining authority was such that a reasonable person would 
be satisfied as to the necessity for making the order of 
preventive detention; 
(ii) 
the satisfaction should be established with regard to each of 
the grounds of detention, and, if one of the grounds is shown 
to be bad, non-existent or irrelevant, the whole order of 
detention would be rendered invalid; 
(iii) 
the initial burden lies on the detaining authority to show the 
legality of the preventive detention; 
(iv) 
the detaining authority must place the whole material, upon 
which the order of detention is based, before the Court 
notwithstanding its claim of privilege with respect to any 

6 W.P.No.20258.23. 
 
document, the validity of which claim shall be within the 
competence of the Court to decide; 
(v) 
the Court has further to be satisfied, in cases of preventive 
detention, that the order of detention was made by the 
authority prescribed in the law relating to preventive 
detention and that every requirement, of the law relating to 
preventive detention had been strictly complied with; 
(vi) 
the “satisfaction” in fact existed with regard to the necessity 
of preventive detention of the detenue; 
(vii) 
the edifice of satisfaction is to be built on the foundation of 
evidence because conjectural presumption cannot be equated 
with satisfaction; it is subjective assessment and there can be 
no objective satisfaction;  
(viii) the grounds of detention should not be vague and indefinite 
and should be comprehensive enough to enable the detenue to 
make representation against his detention to the authority, 
prescribed by law; 
(ix) 
the grounds of detention had been furnished within the period 
prescribed by law, and if no such period is prescribed, then 
“as soon as may be” 
Keeping in mind the above guidelines, I have examined the report 
submitted before this court and observe that following reasons are 
mentioned in the impugned order:- 
“The above said persons are active members of a Political Party. It 
is further submitted that they are involved in activities, 
raised/chanted objectionable slogans amongst the general public to 
provoke and incite them. Moreover, they instigated the general 
public to take out rallies which is destined to create nuisance for 
public and they also delivered objectionable speeches at Davis 
Road, Lahore. On 18-03-2023, the above activists alongwith their 
accomplices blocked the Davis Road, and created law & order 
situation and caused harassment amongst the general public. They 
become potential danger/threat to public peace and tranquility and 
caused law & order situation. Such like activist/miscreant will give 
rise to a situation prejudicial to public safety and maintenance of 
public order, if left unchecked.” 
 
In support of such information no material whatsoever was collected 
by the authority; this Court has also adjourned the case twice to 
produce the material so far collected by the authority but except bald 
assertions cited above no other material was produced. It has been 
observed that grounds of detention have also not been communicated 
to the detenus; mere conjectural presumption cannot take the place of 

7 W.P.No.20258.23. 
 
proof; thus, the requisite necessity for detention was not met before 
issuance of impugned order.  
 
8.    Pursuant to the laws controlling preventative detention, a person 
may only be detained if there are reasonable grounds. The Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in a case reported as “THE GOVERNMENT OF EAST 
PAKISTAN Versus MRS. ROWSHAN BIJAYA SHAUKAT ALI KHAN” (PLD 
1966 Supreme Court 286) has held that the grounds given by the 
authority must be “complete and full”, which means that; 
“There should be as full a statement of the evidence and circumstance 
and the particular acts of the detenu on which the inference against the 
detenu is based as is reasonably possible under the circumstances. The 
Government surely does not in any way suffer if it gives a complete 
statement of facts to the detenu and the cause of justice is advanced by 
a full disclosure.” 
  
The Karachi High Court reinforced this position in MUHAMMAD 
YOUNUS Versus PROVINCE OF SIND THROUGH THE SECRETARY TO THE 
GOVERNMENT OF SIND HOME DEPARTMENT, SIND SECRETARIAT, 
KARACHI AND 2 OTHERS (PLD 1973 Kar 694), It held, “The exercise 
of power by the detaining authority is subject to the ascertainment of 
reasonable grounds, which is a judicial or quasi-judicial function.”  
 
This has further been fortified through the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 as per Article-10(1) which enunciates 
that:-  
 
“No person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being 
informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds for such arrest, nor shall he 
be denied the right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of 
his choice.” 
 
9. 
Though learned Assistant advocate General has maintained that 
this court lacks jurisdiction to dilate upon the issue of preventive 
detention as per section 23 of The Maintenance of Public Order 
Ordinance, 1960 yet the court is not much impressed of such 
contention which has no force. This court in Constitutional 
jurisdiction can entertain the request of the petitioner for declaring the 
detention of the detenus as illegal. While the power of the executive to 
detain is written into the specific preventative detention laws, the 
authority for judicial review comes from Article 199 of the 

8 W.P.No.20258.23. 
 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, which expands 
the jurisdiction of the High Court to include orders, “directing that a 
person in custody within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court be 
brought before it so that the Court may satisfy itself that he is not 
being held in custody without lawful authority or in an unlawful 
manner.” Individuals that are preventatively detained also need not 
wait for their appearance before Review Board to seek judicial review 
of their detention. Reliance is on “Raman Lal Rathi vs Commissioner 
Of Police And Ors” (AIR 1952 Cal. 26). 
 
10.   To prevent misuse of power by the executives and to protect the 
fundamental rights it has been held by Supreme Court in case reported 
as “GOVERNMENT OF SINDH and others Versus Mst. NAJMA” (2001 
SCMR 8) like as under:- 
 
“Since it is the duty of the superior Courts to protect the 
fundamental rights of the people, as such, for achieving above 
object, the superior Courts can exercise all incidental and ancillary 
power and also can adopt new strategies to enforce the 
fundamental rights.” 
  
and in the cited case following order of High Court for imposing cost 
was upheld; 
“Order of preventive detention of detenu, who was candidate in 
elections, passed by District Magistrate, was declared to be without 
lawful authority and of no legal effect by the High Court and a cost 
of Rs.5,000 each was imposed on District Magistrate and the 
Superintendent of Police personally” 
 
Same was the situation in other case reported as “STATE through 
Advocate-General, Sindh, Karachi Versus Mst. TAJI BIBI” (2002 SCMR 
914) 
 
“detenue was kept in custody without lawful order and the order of 
detention under the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, 1960, 
was found to be in flagrant violation of the mandatory 
requirements of section 3 of the said Ordinance and Article 10 of 
the Constitution, and the detenue was allowed compensation at the 
rate of Rs.5,000 per day for a period of 32 days.” 
 
11. 
The learned Assistant Advocate General has pointed out that 
one of the detenus namely Moeed Ullah has also filed a separate 
petition through one Zia-ud-Din which was fixed before another 
learned Bench and a direction was passed for treating his application 

9 W.P.No.20258.23. 
 
as representation for decision in accordance with law, therefore, at 
least he cannot claim any relief in these proceedings. It has been 
observed that present petitioner has assailed the detention order as a 
whole, wherein, name of Moeed Ullah is also written, therefore, when 
the entire impugned order is under scrutiny, it would be unjust to treat 
said Moeed Ullah separately. In any way the representation of Moeed 
Ullah has not been decided so for, therefore, no bar attracts for taking 
decision with respect to his detention as well in this petition.  Even 
otherwise, it is not necessary that firstly the detenus should file a 
representation and then assail their detention. Reliance is placed on 
the case reported as “ABDUL LATIF SHAMSHAD AHMED vs. DISTRICT 
MAGISTRATE, KASUR” (1999 P Cr. L J 2014).  
12. 
For what has been discussed above, since no sufficient material 
is available with the respondents to justify the preventive detention 
through impugned order. Thus, detention of detenus is declared as 
arbitrary, consequently, the instant writ petition is allowed, the 
impugned order bearing No. RDM/303 dated 21.03.2023 passed by 
Deputy Commissioner, Lahore is set-aside and the detenus are 
directed to be released forthwith, if not required to be detained in any 
other case.
