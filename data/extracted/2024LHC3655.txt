          Sultan Tanvir Ahmad, J:- In this petition, extra 
ordinary general meeting (EOGM) dated 31.12.2020, the 
decisions taken therein and superstructure built thereupon 
have been challenged. Besides request to rectify the 
register of directors and other prayers, the petitioners 
have also sought to declare the following documents as 
null and void:- 
i. Board Resolution dated 23.01.2023 (Annex-I) 
ii. Letter dated 24.01.2023 (Annex-J) 
iii. Payment Challan dated 24.01.2023 (Annex-K)

vii. Electronic Form-29 dated 23.02.2023 (Annex-O) 
2.  
M/s Shahid Mahmood & Company (Pvt.) 
Limited (hereinafter called as the “Company”) was 
incorporated on 01.10.1995 with authorized capital of 
Rs.20,000,000/- divided into 200,000 ordinary shares of 
Rs.100/- each. As per Form-A filed until 31.12.2020 and 
record of respondent No. 6 / Securities & Exchange 
Commission of Pakistan (SECP), petitioner No. 2 and 
petitioner No. 3 are holding 52000 and 2000 shares, 
whereas, respondents No. 1 to 5 are holding 48500, 
50500, 5000, 2000 and 40000 shares, respectively.  It is 
the claim of petitioners No. 2 and 3 that on account of the 
dispute inter-se the directors as well as shareholders, no 
meeting has taken place, however, respondents No. 1 to 5 
prepared fake documents including Form-28 and Form-
29 dated 31.12.2020 and then filed the same on 
21.02.2023 with SECP; that the election of directors or 
EOGM has never taken place. It is further averred that 
above referred ante-dated documents being bogus are 
liable to be declared null and void. 
3. 
Mr. Bilal Kashmiri (learned ASC), on behalf of 
the petitioners has submitted that respondents No. 1 to 5 
have prepared back dated forms on the basis of EOGM 
dated 31.12.2020, which has never taken place, to 
deprive petitioner No. 2 (Chief Executive and director) 
and petitioner No. 3 (director), from their rights given 
under the Companies Act, 2017 (the ‘Act of 2017’). 
Learned counsel for the petitioners invited the attention 
of the Court towards various provisions of the Act of 
2017 and he has stated that provisions relating to 

C.O. No. 62104  of 2023 
 
 
3 
issuance of notice, convening or holding the statutory 
meeting are not followed or reflected from the record, 
which essentially makes it amply clear that the fake 
documents were prepared in the year 2023 without any 
meeting and by staging this fraud Petitioners No. 2 and 3 
have been excluded from management and they have 
been deprived from their rights under the company law; 
that this act of fraud is further evident from failure to file 
timely return under section 197(3) of the Act of 2017; 
that mandatory provisions of sections 55, 133, 158 and 
159 have been violated. Learned counsel added that it 
remained the case of petitioners No. 2 and 3 throughout 
before this Court as well as the SECP that the documents 
are fake and they are not backed-up by any meeting or 
valid resolution, however, till to date respondents No. 1 
to 5 have failed to produce any notice, any evidence 
about the date of notice, receipt of notice or agenda of 
meeting, which clearly reflects the fraud. 
4. 
Mr. Faisal Islam-learned ASC, on behalf of 
respondents No. 1 to 5, has raised objections as to the 
maintainability of the present petition on the basis of 
delay relying upon section 136 and 160 of the Act of 
2017. He stated that the said provisions require to 
approach the Court within thirty days from the date of 
election of directors or relevant meeting, whereas, 
present petition is filed after more than three years of the 
EOGM dated 31.12.2020, in which respondents No. 1 
and 2 were elected as directors. He also raised objection 
that the Company has been wrongly impleaded as one of 
the petitioners in the array of parties, which cannot be 
maintained as such. He also contended that the SECP 

C.O. No. 62104  of 2023 
 
 
4 
cannot refuse to accept any form or document on account 
of delay in view of Section 468 of the Act of 2017.  
5. 
Mr. 
Ruman 
Bilal, 
learned 
counsel 
for 
respondent No. 6 / SECP has filed para-wise comments 
and relevant record. He has reiterated contents of para-
wise comments, in course of his arguments.  
6. 
I have heard the arguments and gone through 
the documents produced before the Court by the 
contesting parties as well as the record provided by SECP 
with its comments.  
7. 
To refute the allegation of filing fake 
documents with the SECP, respondents No. 1 to 5 have 
asserted that decision(s) and the documents are in 
pursuant to the decisions taken in EOGM under section 
133(5) of the Act of 2017, which took place on 
31.12.2020 and respondents No. 1 and 2 were elected as 
directors after adopting procedure and in compliance of 
substantial law given in section 159 of the Act of 2017. 
Section 159 of the Act of 2017 is reproduced as under:-. 
“159. Procedure for election of directors. 
(1)   Subject to the provision of section 154, 
the existing directors of a company shall fix 
the number of directors to be elected in the 
general meeting, not later than thirty-five 
days before convening of such meeting and 
the number of directors so fixed shall not 
be changed except with the prior approval 
of the general meeting in which election is 
to be held. 
(2) 
The notice of the meeting at which 
directors are proposed to be elected shall 
among other matters, expressly state----  
(a) 
the number of directors fixed 
under sub-section (1); and  
(b) 
the names of the retiring 
directors. 

C.O. No. 62104  of 2023 
 
 
5 
(3) 
Any member who seeks to contest an 
election to the office of director shall, 
whether he is a retiring director or 
otherwise, file with the company, not later 
than fourteen days before the date of the 
meeting at which elections are to be held, a 
notice of his intention to offer himself for 
election as a director: 
Provided that any such person may, at any 
time before the holding of election, 
withdraw such notice. 
(4) 
All notices received by the company 
in pursuance of sub-section (3) shall be 
transmitted to the members not later than 
seven days before the date of the meeting, 
in the same manner as provided under this 
Act for sending of a notice of general 
meeting. In the case of a listed company 
such notice shall be published in English 
and Urdu languages at least in one issue 
each of a daily newspaper of respective 
language having wide circulation. 
(5) 
xxxx 
(6) 
xxxx”  
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
Sub-section 2 of Section 159 of the Act of 2017, 
reproduced above, requires notice of meeting at which 
directors are proposed to be elected, specifying number 
of directors fixed and names of retiring directors. Any 
member, retiring or otherwise, can give notice of 
intention to offer himself for election of directors in 
terms of Section 159(3) ibid. Notices of intention 
received by company are required to be transmitted to 
members not later than seven days before the date of 
meeting.  
8. 
It has been claimed by learned counsel for 
respondents No. 1 to 5 that directors / respondents No. 1 
and 2 were appointed in EOGM dated 31.12.2020. 
Section 133 of the Act of 2017 permits directors to call 

C.O. No. 62104  of 2023 
 
 
6 
EOGM to consider any matter that requires the approval 
of the company. EOGM can also be requisitioned by 
members by adopting the course given in section 133 (2) 
of the Act of 2017 and subsequent sub-sections. 
However, notice of EOGM is required to be served upon 
the members under section 133(8) of the Act of 2017. It 
will be beneficial to reproduce of the relevant part of 
section 133 which reads as under:- 
“133. Calling of extra-ordinary general 
meeting. 
(1) to (7) xxxxx  
 
(8) 
Notice of an extra-ordinary general 
meeting shall be served to the members in 
the manner provided for in section 55: 
Provided that in case of a company other 
than listed, if all the members entitled to 
attend and vote at any extraordinary general 
meeting so agree, a meeting may be held at 
a shorter notice. 
(9) 
Any contravention or default in 
complying with requirement of this section 
shall be an offence liable 
(a) 
in case of a listed company, to 
a penalty of level 2 on the 
standard scale; and  
(b) 
in case of any other company, 
to a penalty of level 1 on the 
standard scale.”  
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
The above provision clearly requires that notice 
of EOGM should be served to the members in the 
manners given in section 55 of the Act of 2017, which 
reads as under:- 
“55. Service of notice on a member. 
(1) A document or information may be 
served on a member at his registered 
address or, if he has no registered address 
in Pakistan, at the address supplied by him 

C.O. No. 62104  of 2023 
 
 
7 
to the company for the giving of notices to 
him against an acknowledgement or by post 
or courier service or through electronic 
means or in any other manner as may be 
specified.  
(2) Where a notice is sent by post, service of 
the notice shall be deemed to be effected by 
properly addressing, prepaying and posting 
a letter containing the notice and, unless the 
contrary is proved, to have been effected at 
the time at which the letter will be delivered 
in the ordinary course of post.  
(3) A notice may be given by the company to 
the joint-holders of a share by giving the 
notice to the joint-holder named first in the 
register in respect of the share.  
(4) A notice may, in the manner provided 
under sub- section (1), be given by the 
company to the person entitled to a share in 
consequence of death or insolvency of a 
member addressed to him by name or by the 
title or representatives of the deceased or 
assignees of the insolvent or by any like 
description, at the address supplied for the 
purpose by the person calming so to be 
entitled.” 
 
 
The Act of 2017 has given complete mechanism 
from calling a meeting, its notice with agenda of any 
special business, conducting meeting and giving voting 
rights etc. In the present case, the respondents have 
though produced an extract from minutes of alleged 
meeting but somehow during the entire dispute before the 
SECP and the proceedings before this Court, the date 
when meeting was called / date when the notice was 
issued or any copy of issued notice to the members or the 
agenda of meeting conspicuously remained missing.  
9. 
In case titled “Khalid Mehmood and 4 others 
vs. Messrs Multi Plus Corporation Private Limited and 2 
others” (2017 CLD 1737) learned Sindh High Court, 

C.O. No. 62104  of 2023 
 
 
8 
while interpreting the then applicable provisions of 
sections 159 and 178 of the Companies Ordinance-1984, 
concluded that failure to convene meeting / EOGM in the 
manners provided therein or not issuing notice of the 
same, since followed by penal provisions, are mandatory. 
The contravention of provision, as to holding EOGM 
under Section 133 of the Act of 2017, once again carries 
penal consequences. I would like to reproduce the 
relevant extract of Khalid Mehmood case (supra):- 
“…Provision of penalty or a consequence in 
the above sections makes them mandatory in 
nature, as subsection (7) of section 159 of 
the Company Law in clear terms has 
mandated that twenty one (21) days clear 
notice should be given to the members 
before the date of meeting, as far as non-
listed corporate entity is concerned, which is 
the present case.……. 
11. In view of the above discussion, since the 
EOGM in dispute was not convened in 
accordance with the mandatory provisions 
of the Company Law, therefore, the same is 
a nullity in the eyes of law and any Business 
transacted thereat is also illegal. Conscious 
of the fact that defendant No. 1 being a 
corporate entity cannot be run without a 
Board of Directors, thus, the concept of 
transition contained in section 176 of the 
Company Law is invoked, but merely as an 
interim arrangement and solely for the 
transitory period. Consequently, the Board 
of Directors existing immediately before the 
above EOGM is restored, with the sole 
object to hold fresh elections of the Board of 
Directors, strictly in accordance with law, 
inter alia, by giving twenty one (21) days 
clear notice before the date of EOGM on 
which election is to be held, as mandated in 
section 159 of the Company Law, besides 
complying with other relevant provisions.”

In case titled “Nizam Hashwani vs. Hashwani 
Hotels Limited and 14 others” (1999 CLC 1989) the 
requirement to issue notice of EOGM to conduct such 
business was discussed in the following manners:- 
“It was strenuously argued on behalf of the 
plaintiff that the elections of the nine 
Directors held during the meeting of E.G.M. 
of 23-1-1995 was illegal and defective 
inasmuch as the notices were not issued in 
strict compliance of section 159(7) and 
section 50(2) of the Companies Ordinance, 
1984. He has relied upon the case of The 
Karnal Distillary Company Limited Karnal 
PLD 1556 (W.P.) Lah. 731 wherein a 
learned Single Judge of the Lahore High 
Court B. Z .Kaikaus, J. (as his Lordship then 
was) held that if a notice sent on 4thMarch is 
served on 8thMarch and the meeting was 
held on 28thMarch, the number of clear days 
would be only 19. Reliance was placed by 
the Lahore High Court on the cases of 
Railway Sleepers Supply Company's case 
(1885) 29 CH 204 and Hector Shalling 
Limited's case (1936) 1. In the instant suit 
the 
defendants 
have 
refuted 
these 
allegations of the plaintiff and have 
maintained that there was no violation of 
Companies Ordinance, 1984 by holding 
E.G.M. 
and 
elections 
of 
Directors. 
Subsection (7) to section 159 of the 
Companies Ordinance provides that the 
notice of Extraordinary General Meeting 
shall be issued to the members at least 21 
days before the date of meeting. Subsection 
(2) to section 50 provides that in case a 
notice is issued, services of the same shall 
be deemed to be effected, if it is properly 
addressed pre-paid and posted unless the 
contrary is proved.”  
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
To pass a resolution, holding a valid meeting 
with the required quorum after due notice, has always 

C.O. No. 62104  of 2023 
 
 
10 
been considered important even in the previous 
enactment(s) as well as under the common law. In case 
titled “In the matter of the Karnal Distillery Company 
Ltd., Karanaland of the application of Mr. L.P. Jaiswal” 
(PLD 1956 Lahore 731) meeting without notice was 
held invalid. The following part of the said judgment is 
highly relevant:- 
“…The 
justification 
pleaded 
for 
this 
omission to give a notice is the new article 
120 of the company wherein it has been 
provided that a meeting of the directors 
would be held on the first Sunday of each 
month. It is urged that there was, in view of 
this article, no need for sending a notice at 
all. I have no hesitation in rejecting this 
argument. The articles, no doubt, provide 
that a meeting would be held, as far as 
possible on the first Sunday of each month 
but they do not provide for any time and 
place and a notice is also necessary because 
every director is to be informed beforehand 
of the agenda of the meeting. I may also 
refer to the provision in the articles of 
association that a notice of the directors' 
meeting is to be sent by registered post-card 
and that no notice is necessary for a director 
who is not in India. These provisions would 
have been unnecessary and out of place if 
the mere fact that a meeting was to be held 
on the first Sunday of each month was 
sufficient notice. I hold that a notice for 
this meeting was necessary and there being 
no notice the meeting, as was held in H. M. 
EbrahimSait v. South India Industrials 
Ltd. (1) was invalid.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
10. 
It is the claim of petitioners No. 2 and 3 that no 
meeting of the Company has been held since 2018 due to 
complete deadlock and dispute inter-se the shareholders 
as well as the directors. The petitioner-side also relied 

C.O. No. 62104  of 2023 
 
 
11 
upon Form-29 dated 31.12.2017 registered with the 
SECP on 31.01.2018 and they have stated that no change 
has taken place since then. Importantly, the SECP has 
also confirmed that the Company or respondents No. 1 to 
5 have never intimated or filed the required documents 
until the recent past. SECP has highlighted the following 
position as per their record and prior to the filing that 
resulted into dispute, in response to paragraphs 3 and 4 of 
the petition:- 
“3. No Comments except that Mr. Shahid

Mr. Bilal Kashmiri has relied upon different 
documents and he has stated that no meeting of members 
or EOGM took place on 31.12.2020; that the extract from 
minutes of meeting and subsequent actions are fake and 
fabricated. He unequivocally argued that no meeting was 
called for the above purposes as well as no notice was 
issued or served upon petitioners No. 2 and 3. Mr. Faisal 
Islam- learned ASC though denied that the documents 
are forged and fabricated, however, he failed to show 
anything from record regarding any notice for alleged 
EOGM or even disclose the date of issuing or service of 
notice(s). This dispute remained pending before the 
SECP for some time and before SECP issued letter dated 
19.05.2023 referring to sections 466, 197(5) and 160 of 
the Act of 2017. The contesting respondents were 
repeatedly asked to provide documents or to answer 
about the deficiencies. They filed different replies before 
SECP. Perusal of the same, including the written 
response dated 10.03.2023 filed by the respondents and 
appended with the reply to this petition, reflect that the 
same is totally silent about the above deficiencies 
including calling date of EOGM, notices etc.  
12. 
Right from the beginning of dispute, petitioner 
No. 2 kept complaining before SECP that respondents are 
deliberately reluctant to give proof or appending 
document showing that EOGM was ever called or it took 
place. This complaint is also reflected from letter dated 

C.O. No. 62104  of 2023 
 
 
13 
17.05.2023 available on the file. Somehow, respondents 
No. 1 to 5 even up till now are reluctant to append those 
documents or to show anything from the record if any 
notice was ever prepared. It is averred in the reply that 
EOGM has taken place on 31.12.2020 when two 
directors namely Zahid Mahmood and Abid Mahmood 
were elected. This reply does not reflect the date of 
notice(s), their issuance or service. The reply is totally 
silent as to which mode of service under section 55 of the 
Act of 2017 was adopted. The reply does not contain 
plausible reason or justification to stay silent for years 
and not contacting SECP or filing the forms or the 
required return. Form-29 in dispute contains date of 
31.12.2020. No cause could be given by the respondents 
for not filing the same through electronic mode or 
otherwise for more than two years and then getting it 
received manually on 21.02.2023.  
13. 
Mr. Faisal Islam- learned ASC for respondents 
No. 1 to 5 instead of offering response to all above, has 
mainly focused on his preliminary objection(s), much 
emphasizing on the proviso to section 136 and section 
160 of the Act of 2017, arguing that meeting can be 
called into question within thirty days only and the same 
period is provided for challenging election of directors. 
The relied provisions read as under:- 
“136. Power of the Court to declare the 
proceedings of a general meeting invalid. 
The Court may, on a petition, by members 
having not less than ten percent of the voting 
power in the company, that the proceedings 
of a general meeting be declared invalid by 
reason of a material defect or omission in 
the notice or irregularity in the proceedings 
of the meeting, which prevented members 

C.O. No. 62104  of 2023 
 
 
14 
from using effectively their rights, declare 
such proceedings or part thereof invalid and 
direct holding of a fresh general meeting: 
Provided that the petition shall be made 
within thirty days of the impugned 
meeting.” 
 
“160. Powers of the Court to declare 
election of directors invalid.  The Court 
may, on the application of members holding 
ten percent of the voting power in the 
company, made within thirty days of the date 
of election, declare election of all directors 
or any one or more of them invalid if it is 
satisfied that there has been material 
irregularity in the holding of the elections 
and matters incidental or relating thereto. 
 
 
Section 136 of the Act of 2017 provides that 
proceedings of general meeting can be declared invalid 
for the reasons of material defect or omission in the 
notice or irregularity in the proceedings of the meeting, 
which prevented members from using effectively their 
rights. The proviso to the same reads that petition in this 
regard can be made within thirty days of the impugned 
meeting. Section 160 of the Act of 2017 also provides 
thirty days to challenge the election of all the directors or 
any one or more of them on the ground of material 
irregularity in holding the election. Admittedly, the 
legislature has envisaged thirty days period to challenge a 
meeting, however, the case in hand is not that of 
irregularity or defective meeting but no meeting at all. It 
is not the case of the petitioners either that the election of 
directors has taken place which suffers from material 
irregularity. The proposition put-forth by learned counsel 
for petitioner No. 2 and 3 is that no meeting has taken 
place and only documents are submitted to change the 
existing position or composition of the board and 

C.O. No. 62104  of 2023 
 
 
15 
objection is raised after filing untrue documents with 
SECP that too after more than two years of the so-called 
meeting; the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case 
give rise to the question that in the absence of holding 
EOGM, if it can be permitted to merely file forms or 
documents with SECP and then to state that challenge 
was required to be made within thirty days by simply 
showing an extract of minutes of so-called meeting that 
pertains to a period much prior to thirty days, claiming 
before the Court that delay is caused by the party 
complaining. The above discussed provisions do not 
contemplate that instead of holding meeting just to file 
forms backed up by some extract from minutes of 
clueless and so-called meeting and then to take shelter of 
thirty days period to make challenge. Proviso to section 
136 of the Act of 2017 provides that petition shall be 
made within thirty days of the impugned meeting but 
present case is one where holding of meeting or EOGM 
could not be convincingly shown from the record. In the 
unusual circumstances of the case, respondents No. 1 to 5 
should have first persuaded or at-least demonstrated with 
some certainty that the EOGM has actually taken place 
and then to seek shelter of the period provided by law to 
make challenge. Learned counsel for the petitioners has 
stated that falsehood is further evident from failure to file 
return or forms for such a long time period. He has stated 
that even return in terms of section 197(3) of the Act of 
2017 for the change claimed in pursuance to the so-called 
EOGM does not exist. This position is confirmed by 
SECP. Learned counsel for respondents No. 1 to 5 
instead of explaining the reasons for non-compliance of

several provisions of the Act of 2017 is simply seeking 
escape on the basis of period to make challenge, 
however, he even could not produce copy of notice, the 
mode adopted under section 55 of the Act of 2017 or any 
affidavit from the respondents to show the date of issuing 
notice of the EOGM inviting all entitled to notice, attend 
and vote in the EOGM.  
 
In case titled “Tariq Aziz and others vs. 
Makhdum Ahmed Mahmud and others” (2022 CLD 
1279) this Court, while exercising powers under sections 
136 and 160 of the Act of 2017 and declaring the 
concerned election as invalid, directed to hold fresh 
meeting and concluded:  
…Section 160 of the Act empowers the 
Court to declare election of all directors or 
any one or more of them' invalid if it is 
satisfied that there has been material 
irregularity in its holding. Therefore, in the 
light of principles enunciated in "National 
Investment Trust Ltd. v. Al-Qaim Textile 
Mills Ltd." (1999 CLC 926) wherein it was 
held that "the very meeting held on the 27th 
March, 1998was irregular and not in 
accordance with law as the members were 
prevented from using their right to vote 
effectively. In consequence thereof; the 
proceedings of Agenda Item No.3 relating to 
elections of Directors are declared to be 
invalid and the respondent is directed to 
hold afresh a General Meeting for holding 
of elections of members of the Board of 
Directors of respondent's Company in 
accordance with law" the Petitioners' right 
of vote was denied by the Respondents to 
participate in AGM…. 
 
14.  
For the above discussed failure(s) on the part of 
respondents No. 1 to 5 and keeping in view the peculiar 
circumstances of the case, I have no hesitation to hold 

C.O. No. 62104  of 2023

EOGM dated 31.12.2020 and its proceedings as invalid. In 
consequence thereof, parties are directed to hold afresh 
general meeting, in accordance with law. Notices and 
agenda shall be issued strictly in terms of the Act of 2017. 
SECP to appoint an officer to supervise the process and the 
meeting. This process shall be completed within two months 
from the date of receipt of certified copy of this judgment. It 
is clarified that no act or transaction with any third party and 
the Company is brought into question in this case. No order 
as to cost.
