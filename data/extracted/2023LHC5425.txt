Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – This petition under Article 199 of 
the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, is directed 
against Punjab Healthcare Commission’s decision dated 01.11.2021 and the 
judgment dated 12.10.2022 delivered by the District Judge, Faisalabad. 
Facts of the case 
2. 
 
On 19.10.2019 at 08:00 a.m., the Petitioner, who was 23 years 
old at that time, was admitted to Prime Care Hospital, Faisalabad (PCH), for 
delivery of her baby under the care of Respondent No.5, Consultant 
Gynecologist. On the first day, Respondent No.5 told the Petitioner’s 
attendants that the birth would be regular, so they purchased medicines from 
the hospital’s pharmacy for the normal procedure. On 20.10.2019, she 
informed them that a Caesarean section (C-section) was urgently required 
and operated on the Petitioner under epidural anaesthesia administered by 
Respondents No.6 and 7. A baby girl was born. After some time, the hospital 
staff handed over the newborn to the Petitioner’s family members but shifted

her to the room after an hour. The Petitioner regained consciousness the 
following morning, but the doctors discovered that the lower part of her 
body was paralyzed. Respondent No.5 recommended conducting MRI,  
CT Scan, and NCS-EMG. These tests revealed that she had developed 
paraplegia/ plexopathy. She lost control of her urine and stool and could not 
pass them without a catheter bag and enema. On 09.11.2019, PCH 
discharged her, even though there was no improvement in her condition. 
3. 
 
On 18.11.2019, the Petitioner filed a complaint with the Punjab 
Healthcare Commission (the “Commission”) through her Special Attorney, 
Muhammad Nazim, against PCH (Respondent No.4), its doctors 
(Respondents No.5 to 7), and PCH’s administrator (Respondent No.8), 
alleging medical negligence, maladministration, and malpractice. The 
Commission took cognizance and issued notice to Respondents No.4 to 8. 
4. 
 
Respondent No.8, administrator of PCH, submitted his reply 
stating that Respondent No.5 admitted the Petitioner to the hospital for 
delivery on 19.10.2019. Respondent No.7, an anaesthetist, administered her 
epidural, which was partially ineffective. Therefore, Respondent No.6, 
another anaesthetist, gave the second epidural. Meanwhile, Respondent No.1 
decided to perform a C-section with the help of Respondent No.7. After the 
surgery, the Petitioner complained that she couldn’t move her legs. The duty 
doctor immediately informed Respondents No.5 to 7 who examined the 
patient. Respondent No.8 further submitted that a neurologist, Dr Javaid 
Iqbal, was also engaged who visited the Petitioner daily. He advised her to 
stay at the hospital for proper neuro care, but her family refused and sought 
her discharge which was done on 09.11.2019. Respondent No.8 denied the 
allegations of maladministration, malpractice and medical negligence 
levelled by Muhammad Nazim. He added that doctors monitored her around 
the clock when the Petitioner was in the hospital. Besides, Respondents No.5 
to 7 paid her daily visits. 
5. 
 
Respondents No.5 to 7 also submitted their replies on the above 
lines. 
6. 
 
After preliminary proceedings, the Commission recorded the 
parties’ evidence and sought opinions from one neurologist and two 
anaesthesia experts. Importantly, original operation notes were not available 

Writ Petition No. 71548/2022

in the patient file. Subsequently, Dr Atiqa Irshad made duplicate notes on 
the advice of the PCH’s Administrator (Respondent No.8) and the 
Consultant Gynecologist (Respondent No.5). 
Healthcare Commission’s order dated 01.11.2021 
7. 
 
The Commission decided the Petitioner’s complaint by order 
dated 01.11.2021 in the following terms: 
(i) 
The decision of the Consultant Gynecologist (Respondent No.5) 
was justified in performing C-section on the Petitioner. 
(ii) 
The exact cause of severe Radicylopathy-plexopathy of the lumber 
area developed by the Petitioner could not be established according 
to the duplicate clinical notes.  
(iii) 
The question as to whether Respondents No.6 & 7 had committed 
medical negligence, and if so, to what extent in administering 
epidural anaesthesia to the Petitioner requires further probe. 
Therefore, their cases be sent to the Pakistan Medical Commission 
for proceeding in accordance with the law. 
(iv) 
On 08.06.2021, the Commission inspected PCH and found that its 
score on the Minimum Service Delivery Standards Table (MSDS 
Table) was only 37% which is unacceptable. Therefore, the 
Commission imposed a fine of Rs.300,000/- on it. Twenty per cent 
of that amount, when recovered, shall be paid to the Petitioner. 
(v) 
PCH is directed to improve its score on the MSDS Table up to 
70% within three weeks, failing which necessary action shall be 
taken in accordance with the law.  
8. 
 
Respondent No.8 filed an appeal on behalf of PCH against the 
Commission’s order in the Court of the District Judge, Faisalabad, which 
was dismissed on the ground of limitation vide judgment dated 12.10.2022. 
Reportedly, the PCH has deposited the penalty of Rs.300,000/- imposed on 
it. 
9. 
 
The Petitioner also partially challenged the Commission’s order 
but the District Judge, Faisalabad, dismissed it by judgment dated 
12.10.2022 for lack of jurisdiction. 
10. 
 
Respondents No.6 and 7 did not assail the Commission’s order 
dated 01.11.2021. They are facing proceedings before the Pakistan Medical 
Commission (PMC). 
The District Judge’s judgment dated 12.10.2022 on the Petitioner’s appeal 
11. 
 
In her appeal before the District Judge, the Petitioner contended 
that Respondents No.5 to 8 removed, or caused to be removed, the original 
operation notes from her file to screen themselves of civil and criminal 
liability. They had thus committed an offence under section 201 PPC. The 

Writ Petition No. 71548/2022 
 
 
 
- 4 - 
Commission was, therefore, required under section 26(2) of the PHC Act to 
direct registration of FIR against them. Secondly, the Commission had erred 
in exonerating Respondent No.5. Thirdly, the Commission was obliged to 
declare the doctors (Respondents No.5 to 7) guilty of medical negligence 
before referring their case to the PMC. Fourthly, the fine imposed on PCH 
was disproportionate to the offence which it had committed. It should, 
therefore, be enhanced from Rs.300,000/- to Rs.500,000/-. Lastly, PCH 
should be sealed and banned from providing any healthcare facilities. 
12. 
 
The District Judge held that section 31 of the Punjab Healthcare 
Commission Act 2010 (the “PHC Act”) provides appeals against five kinds 
of orders only. The Petitioner’s appeal is beyond the purview of that section. 
In particular, no appeal lies against the Commission’s order fixing 
responsibility upon any delinquent and for enhancement of fine. 
Accordingly, the Judge dismissed the Petitioner’s appeal as being not 
maintainable. He relied upon the following two unreported judgments of this 
Court for his holding: (i) Haseeb Ullah and another v. District & Sessions 
Judge and others (Writ Petition No.227659/2018); (ii) Dr. Muhammad 
Dilawaiz Mujahid v. Punjab Healthcare Commission etc. (Writ Petition 
No.48460/2019). 
The submissions 
13. 
 
The Petitioner’s counsel, Mr Ghulam Mustafa Sabir, Advocate, 
contends that the District Judge has misconstrued the law while dismissing 
the Petitioner’s appeal by judgment dated 12.10.2022. Section 31 of the 
PHC Act is not a standalone provision. It has to be read in conjunction with 
section 30 which makes all the orders issued by the Commission amenable 
to the appellate jurisdiction of the District Judge. He prays that the matter be 
remanded to him for a decision on merits. 
14. 
 
Mr Sabir submits that the Petitioner is partially aggrieved by 
the Commission’s order of 1st November. Even if it is assumed that her 
appeal before the District Judge was not competent, this Court has ample 
jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution to issue a writ of certiorari 
to correct the errors in the said order. The Petitioner cannot be left without a 
remedy. She has urged all those grounds in this petition for the modification 

Writ Petition No. 71548/2022 
 
 
 
- 5 - 
of the Commission’s order which she raised in her memorandum of appeal 
before the District Judge (see paragraph 11 of this judgment). 
15. 
 
The Commission has submitted a para-wise reply to this 
petition. It has defended its order dated 01.11.2021 with full force and 
contends that it fully meets the ends of justice. It states that it provided the 
parties a fair opportunity to prove their respective claims and also sought 
expert opinions from the people of the relevant fields for a just and correct 
decision. It did not find Respondent No.5 had committed any medical 
negligence, so it exonerated her but deemed it proper to send the cases of 
Respondents No.6 & 7 to the PMC for further proceedings. The Commission 
has taken action against Respondents No.6 & 7 under section 26(2) of the 
PHC Act. 
16. 
 
According to the Commission, it thoroughly probed the issue of 
the loss of the Petitioner’s original operation notes. It found that they were 
misplaced and not destroyed by PCH, as the Petitioner claimed. 
Subsequently, duplicate notes were prepared by Dr Atiqa Arshad. In these 
circumstances, it did not have to invoke section 26(2) of the PHC Act to 
direct registration of FIR under section 201 PPC. 
17. 
 
Mr Sittar Sahil, Assistant Advocate General, contends that the 
Commission’s order dated 01.11.2021 and the District Judge’s judgment 
dated 12.10.2022 on the Petitioner’s appeal are well reasoned and do not call 
for interference by this Court in its constitutional jurisdiction. 
18. 
 
Mr Salah-ud-Din Siddiqui, Advocate, submits that Respondents 
No.5 to 7 are distinguished doctors and experts in their respective 
disciplines. They have not committed any medical negligence for which they 
may held accountable. He has produced copies from various medical 
reference books to support his claim. Nevertheless, the Commission had 
exonerated Respondent No.5 only and referred the cases of Respondents 
No.6 & 7 to the PMC. Following the enactment of the Pakistan Medical and 
Dental Council Act 2022 (“PMDC Act of 2022”), these cases are now 
pending with the Council’s disciplinary committee.1 Mr Siddiqui contends 
that the Act of 2022 provides a comprehensive procedure for dealing with 
                                          
1 Pakistan Medical and Dental Council Act 2022 has dissolved the Pakistan Medical Commission, subject 
to section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897.

complaints of professional negligence against medics. This Court has no 
jurisdiction to interfere in the matter under its constitutional mandate. It 
cannot declare Respondents No.5 to 7 guilty of medical negligence as the 
Petitioner wishes. 
19. 
 
Mr Zulfiqar Ali Kamboh, Advocate, submits that PCH has 
deposited the penalty imposed on it by the Commission and improved its 
MSDS score as required. He contends that the Commission exercised its 
jurisdiction legally and reasonably while imposing the aforesaid penalty. 
This Court cannot enhance it while exercising constitutional powers under 
Article 199. 
Opinion 
20. 
 
In 2008, the Government of the Punjab initiated efforts to 
regulate the healthcare delivery system in the province. For this purpose, it 
got in touch with the stakeholders and also hired consultants. In the 
meantime, an incident occurred in Lahore in which a baby girl named 
Imanae Malik allegedly died because of medical negligence. There was a 
huge public outcry upon which the then Chief Justice of the Lahore High 
Court took suo motu notice. Subsequently, Writ Petition No.23796/2009 was 
also filed. One of His Lordship’s orders passed in those proceedings was 
challenged before the Supreme Court of Pakistan in CPLA No.2510/L/2009 
(titled: “Doctors Hospital (Private) Ltd. etc. v. Government of the Punjab 
etc.”) which was heard on 30.12.2009. The learned Bench voiced serious 
concerns about the lack of a regulatory mechanism to monitor the licensing 
and accreditation of the privately-run hospitals and to ensure a minimum 
standard of quality of services, which it also recorded in its order of that 
date. Against this backdrop, the Punjab Assembly enacted the PHC Act. The 
Commission has been established under section 3 thereof. 
21. 
 
Section 4(1) of the PHC Act empowers the Commission to 
perform such functions and exercise such powers as may be required to 
improve the quality of healthcare services and clinical governance and ban 
quackery. Section 4(2) outlines some of those functions, which inter alia 
include: 

Writ Petition No. 71548/2022 
 
 
 
- 7 - 
(a) 
maintain a register of all healthcare service providers; 
(b) 
grant, revoke and renew licenses to persons involved in the 
provision of healthcare services and to vary terms and conditions 
and purposes of the licences; 
(c) 
monitor and regulate the quality and standards; 
(e) 
enquire and investigate maladministration, malpractice and failures 
in the provision of healthcare services and issue consequential 
advice and orders; 
(g) 
impose and collect penalties on violation, breach or non-
compliance of the provisions of the rules, regulations, standing 
orders and instructions issued under this Act; 
(o) 
issue regulations, guidelines, instructions and directives to persons 
involved in the provision of healthcare services; 
(p) 
grading of the healthcare establishments; 
22. 
 
Section 4(7) of the PHC Act stipulates that, notwithstanding the 
provisions of any other legislation, the Commission may conduct an 
investigation on the complaint of an aggrieved person or a healthcare service 
provider.2 However, it must do so if the Government or the Punjab 
Assembly makes a reference, or the Supreme Court of Pakistan or the 
Lahore High Court directs it during any proceedings. Section 4(8) empowers 
the Commission to take cognizance of any incident involving the harassment 
of a healthcare service provider or damage to a healthcare establishment3 
and then refer the matter to the appropriate legal authority for further action. 
23. 
 
As per Regulation 6 of the Punjab Healthcare Commission 
Complaint Management Regulations, 2014 (the “2014 Regulations”), the 
Commission has jurisdiction over all complaints regarding medical 
negligence, maladministration, malpractice or failure to provide healthcare 
services. Section 2(xxii) of the PHC Act, read with section 19, defines 
“medical negligence,” while Regulation 2 describes “maladministration,” 
“malpractice,” and “neglect.” Section 28 of the PHC Act empowers the 
Commission to impose fines up to Rs.500,000/- for violations of the Act and 
                                          
2 Section 2(xvii) of the PHC Act states: 
“healthcare service provider” means an owner, manager or incharge of a healthcare establishment 
and includes a person registered by the Medical and Dental Council, Council for Tibb, Council for 
Homeopathy or Nursing Council. 
3 Section 2(xv) of the PHC Act states: 
“healthcare establishment” means a hospital, diagnostic centre, medical clinics, nursing home, 
maternity home, dental clinic, homeopathy clinic, Tibb clinic, acupuncture, physiotherapy clinic or 
any other premises or conveyance- 
(a) wholly or partly used for providing healthcare services; and 
(b) declared by the Government, by order published in the official Gazette, as a healthcare 
establishment; 

Writ Petition No. 71548/2022 
 
 
 
- 8 - 
the rules and regulations made thereunder, keeping in view the gravity of the 
infraction. Thus, the Commission performs a dual function: on the one hand, 
it acts as a regulator, and on the other, it decides on issues involving 
patients’ rights and obligations, as well as those of healthcare service 
providers and healthcare establishments. 
24. 
 
On 18.11.2022, the Petitioner filed a complaint with the 
Commission through her Special Attorney, Muhammad Nazim, against PCH 
(Respondent No.4) and its doctors (Respondents No.5 to 7) and the 
administrator (Respondent No.8). The Commission decided it by order dated 
01.11.2021 in the terms mentioned in paragraph 7 of this judgment. The 
Petitioner was partly dissatisfied with that order, so she preferred an appeal 
before the District Judge. The first question that arises for consideration is 
whether it was maintainable. Sections 30 and 31 of the PHC Act are relevant 
for the discussion which I reproduce below for ready reference: 
30. 
Bar of jurisdiction.– Save as provided in this Act, no court other 
than the Court of the District and Sessions Judge shall have jurisdiction- 
(a) 
to question the validity of any action taken, or intended to 
be taken, or order made, or anything done or purporting to have 
been taken, made or done under this Act; or 
(b) 
to grant an injunction or stay or to make any interim order 
in relation to any proceeding before, or anything done or intended 
to be done or purporting to have been done by, or under the orders 
or at the instance of the Commission.  
31. 
Appeal.– (1) A person who is aggrieved by the –  
(a) 
refusal of the Commission to issue or renew a license; 
(b) 
decision of the Commission to suspend or revoke a license; 
(c) 
order of closing down of a healthcare establishment or 
making improvements in the healthcare establishment; 
(d) 
order relating to equipment, apparatus, appliances, or other 
things at a healthcare establishment; or 
(e) 
imposition of a fine by the Commission. 
may, within thirty days from the date of communication of the order of the 
Commission, prefer an appeal in writing to the District and Sessions 
Judge. 
(2) 
The healthcare service provider shall provide legal aid to a person, 
working in the healthcare establishment, pertaining to the matters related 
to this Act. 
25. 
 
It is well-settled that the right to appeal is a substantive 
privilege established by law4 and must be expressly provided by the  
                                          
4 Rahim Shah v. The Chief Election Commissioner of Pakistan and another (PLD1973 SC 24); Pakistan 
Defence Officers’ Housing Authority and others v. Lt. Col. Syed Jawaid Ahmed (2013 SCMR 1707); 
Malik Umar Aslam v. Mrs. Sumaira Malik and others (2014 SCMR 45); Mian Khalid Rauf  v. Chaudhry 
Muhammad Saleem and another (PLD 2015 SC 348).

statute.5 It cannot be implied.6 A bare perusal of section 31 of the PHC Act 
reflects that the right of appeal under the enactment is limited to five types 
of orders passed by the Commission. Section 30 merely mentions the bar of 
jurisdiction. It states that no court other than the Court of the District and 
Sessions Judge has the authority to question the legality of any action taken, 
order made or thing done under the PHC Act, or to grant an injunction, or 
stay or to issue an interim order in relation to any proceedings initiated by 
the Commission. Section 30 does not confer any new appellate powers on 
the District and Sessions Judge or otherwise broaden the scope of section 31. 
The judgments passed by this Court in the unreported cases of Haseeb Ullah 
and Dr. Muhammad Dilawaiz Mujahid7 fully support this view. 
26. 
 
Clause (e) of section 31(1) of the PHC Act grants the right of 
appeal to a person aggrieved by the order of the Commission imposing a 
fine. This provision cannot be stretched to provide for an appeal in cases 
where a fine is denied or to enable an appeal for increasing the amount of a 
fine. The rule stated by Tindal C.J. in Sussex Peerage Case [1844] 11 Clark 
and Finnelly 85, 8 ER 1034, still holds the field and is followed by the 
courts in all countries. He said: 
“The only rule for the construction of Acts of Parliament is that they 
should be construed according to the intent of the Parliament which passed 
the Act. If the words of the statute are in themselves precise and 
unambiguous, then no more can be necessary than to expound those words 
in their natural and ordinary sense. The words themselves alone do in such 
case, best declare the intention of the lawgiver. But if any doubt arises 
from the terms employed by the Legislature, it has always been held a safe 
means of collecting the intention, to call in aid the ground and cause of 
making the statute and to have recourse to the preamble, which, according 
to Chief Justice Dyer (Stowel v Lord Zouch, Plowden, 369), is ‘a key to 
open the minds of the makers of the Act, and the mischiefs which they 
intended to redress’.” 
27. 
 
Flex Frank writes:8 
 
“Whatever temptations the statesmanship of policymaking might wisely 
suggest, construction must eschew interpolation and evisceration.  
[The judge] must not read in by way of creation.”

Mr Sabir could not persuade me that the District Judge’s 
judgment dated 12.10.2022 dismissing the Petitioner’s appeal is erroneous. 
Hence, I uphold it. 
29. 
 
The Commission’s order dated 01.11.2021 is quasi-judicial and 
is, therefore, susceptible to judicial review. However, before attending to the 
case at hand, let’s look at the breadth of that power. 
30. 
 
The ancient supervisory jurisdiction of judicial review, which 
Blackstone’s Commentaries refer to as a “very high and transcendent” 
jurisdiction, was an inherent jurisdiction exercised by the superior courts 
through the common law prerogative writs of habeas corpus, mandamus, 
prohibition, certiorari and quo warranto. These ancient prerogative writs 
derive their name from their historical association with the King’s 
prerogative, which empowered the monarch as the fountain of justice to 
oversee the due enforcement of the law by government officials and 
tribunals.9 
31. 
 
The King’s Bench Division in England exercises supervisory 
jurisdiction when issuing the writ of certiorari (which literally means  
“to be certified” or “to be more fully informed”), and by means thereof, it 
calls for the records and proceedings to examine their legality. The 
following are the grounds on which it would interfere: (i) absence or excess 
of jurisdiction, (ii) breach of rules of natural justice committed by the 
tribunal during the proceedings, and (iii) an error of law apparent on the face 
of the record.10 According to Brohi, if a tribunal assumes jurisdiction 
following the determination of a question of fact (known as jurisdictional 
fact in America) the existence of which has been made a condition precedent 
for the exercise of the tribunal’s jurisdiction by the statute, the superior court 
will review the finding of the fact to ascertain whether the tribunal has 
properly acquired jurisdiction.11 
32. 
 
Basu states that there has been a significant transformation in 
the judicial perspective regarding the writ of certiorari since the pivotal 
House of Lords decision in Ridge v. Baldwin, (1964) AC 40. Before that

case, there was a widespread consensus that certiorari did not lie against 
purely administrative functions when the relevant statute imposed no duty to 
proceed judicially.12 However, in Ridge’s case, the House of Lords, by a 
majority, held that even when the enactment did not specify any judicial 
procedure for the performance of an administrative function, the law implied 
an obligation to act in accordance with the principles of natural justice if the 
exercise of the statutory power affected an individual’s rights or determined 
“what the rights of an individual should be.”13 
33. 
 
In Council of Civil Service Union v. Minister (1984) 3 All ER 
935, Lord Diplock observed that the law has developed to the point where 
one can easily categorize the grounds for judicial review of administrative 
action under three headings. He called the first ground “illegality,” the 
second “irrationality,” and the third “procedural impropriety.” However, he 
emphasized that the ongoing development, which is on a case-by-case basis, 
may add further grounds in the future. “I have in mind particularly the 
possible adoption in the future of the principle of ‘proportionality’, which is 
recognized in the administrative law of several of our fellow members of the 
European Economic Community.” Lord Diplock explained: 
“ ‘illegality’ as a ground for judicial review I mean that the decision-
maker must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision-
making power and must give effect to it. Whether he has or not is par 
excellence a justiciable question to be decided, in the event of dispute, by 
those persons, the judges, by whom the judicial power of the state is 
exercisable. 
“By ‘irrationality’ I mean what can by now be succinctly referred to as 
"Wednesbury unreasonableness" (Associated Provincial Picture Houses 
Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corporation [1948] 1 KB 223). It applies to a decision 
which is so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral 
standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question 
to be decided could have arrived at it ... 
“I have described the third head as ‘procedural impropriety’ rather than 
failure to observe basic rules of natural justice or failure to act with 
procedural fairness towards the person who will be affected by the 
decision. This is because susceptibility to judicial review under this head 
covers also failure by an administrative tribunal to observe procedural 
rules that are expressly laid down in the legislative instrument by which its 
jurisdiction is conferred, even where such failure does not involve any 
denial of natural justice.”  
34. 
 
The High Courts in Pakistan were granted the power to issue 
writs for the first time in 1954 when the Government of India Act, 1935,

which served as the country’s Constitution at that time, was amended and 
section 223-A was inserted. Since then, the High Courts have exercised that 
authority under succeeding constitutional dispensations. The Constitution of 
1956 replaced the 1935 Act. Article 22 of that Constitution, on the one hand, 
granted citizens the right to petition the Supreme Court for the enforcement 
of fundamental rights through appropriate proceedings. On the other, it 
empowered the Supreme Court to issue directions, orders, and writs like 
habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari, as 
deemed appropriate, to any person or authority, including when necessary, 
any Government, for the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights. 
Article 170 of the 1956 Constitution conferred similar powers upon each 
High Court for the enforcement of fundamental rights and any other 
purpose. The Constitution of 1962 brought significant changes to the law of 
judicial review in Pakistan, both in terms of procedure and substance. It also 
did away with the Latin names of the prerogative writs. In Mehboob Ali 
Malik v. The Province of West Pakistan and another [PLD 1963 (W.P.) 
Lahore 575], Manzoor Qadir CJ. eloquently explained this legal 
development and remarked that the rules governing the use of various writs 
have become more consistent. As a result, the scope of the earlier writ has 
been broadened in certain cases and narrowed in others. For instance, 
certiorari, which was initially limited to judicial or quasi-judicial decisions, 
can now be used in any case where orders exceed jurisdiction, regardless of 
whether they are issued by judicial, quasi-judicial, or non-judicial 
authorities. Furthermore, under Article 98 of the 1962 Constitution, every 
case is now subject to the condition that this jurisdiction may only be used 
when no other adequate remedy is available. In English Law, this 
requirement was rigorously applied mainly to mandamus and was less 
stringent for certiorari. 
35. 
 
The concept adopted in the 1962 Constitution has been 
followed in the successor Constitutions, namely the Interim Constitution of 
1972 and the Constitution of 1973, without any material change in language. 
36. 
 
Clause (a)(ii) of Article 199(1) of the Constitution of 1973 
provides that, subject to the Constitution, a High Court may, if it is satisfied 
that no other adequate remedy is provided by law, on the application of any 
person, make an order declaring that any act done or proceeding taken 

Writ Petition No. 71548/2022

within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court by a person performing 
functions in connection with the affairs of the Federation, a Province or local 
authority has been done or taken without lawful authority and is of no legal 
effect. Since this provision is analogous to clause (2)(b)(i) of Article 98 of 
the 1962 Constitution, I begin by reviewing some of the cases decided under 
that clause to understand its meaning. In Badrul Haque Khan v. The 
Election Tribunal, Dacca, and others (PLD 1963 SC 704), the Dacca High 
Court quashed the Election Tribunal’s order. The argument before the 
Supreme Court was that a mere misconception by the inferior tribunal on the 
point of law was not sufficient ground for the High Court to intervene. 
Furthermore, a tribunal cannot be deemed to have exceeded its jurisdiction 
just because it admits illegal evidence, rejects legal evidence, misjudges the 
weight of the evidence, or convicts without evidence. Kaikaus J. stated he 
was “prepared to concede” that admitting inadmissible evidence would be an 
act without lawful authority. He went on to say: 
“The proposition is indisputable that when there is jurisdiction to decide a 
particular matter, then there is jurisdiction to decide it rightly or wrongly, 
and the fact that the decision is incorrect does not render the decision 
without jurisdiction. I do not see any difference in a case where the 
question of law decided is a matter on which two opinions can easily be 
held and a case where the decision on a question of law appears to be 
clearly erroneous. It would not make a difference that, on logical 
reasoning, the interpretation of law by the tribunal could not be supported. 
Unless a case of mala fides or a mere colourable exercise of jurisdiction 
could be made out, the decision would not be without lawful authority. If 
an order can be without legal authority because of a clearly wrong 
determination of a question of law, it should be without legal authority 
even in case of a clearly wrong determination of a question of fact. There 
is no reason for any distinction in this connection between a decision on a 
question of law and a decision on a question of fact. So if we were to 
accept the proposition that clearly erroneous decisions are without lawful 
authority, the Court acting under Article 98 would constitute itself a Court 
of appeal for matters of fact as well as matters of law.” 
37. 
 
In Mian Jamal Shah v. The Member Election Commission, 
Government of Pakistan, and others (PLD 1966 SC 1), the Supreme Court 
of Pakistan clarified that proceedings under Article 98 of the 1962 
Constitution are not a continuation of the same processes as in an appeal 
where a cause is re-heard. Instead, the High Court’s role is to examine the 
legality of actions taken by those granted certain powers by the law. If the 
High Court finds these actions illegal, it declares them as such. Essentially, 
proceedings under Article 98 are similar to a suit in which an order issued by 
an officer or authority is challenged. There is little distinction between the 

Writ Petition No. 71548/2022 
 
 
 
- 14 -
High Court’s jurisdiction under clause (a) of Article 98(2) and the power 
exercised by an ordinary civil court. 
38. 
 
The Supreme Court also dilated on the phrase “without lawful 
authority” in Jamal Shah. It observed that it was no longer res integra that if 
a court has jurisdiction to decide a matter, it has jurisdiction to decide it 
rightly or wrongly. The word “decide” inherently contains the power and 
possibility of reaching more than one conclusion. If it is accepted that a 
wrong decision on a question of law renders an act “without lawful 
authority”, the High Court would become a court of appeal for all orders 
passed by any judicial or quasi-judicial tribunal, making redundant section 
100 of the Code of Civil Procedure and some other provisions, which grant 
the High Court limited power to interfere with judgments of some courts. 
Section 115 CPC would become useless because the High Court's 
jurisdiction under Article 98 would be greater than that exercised under that 
provision.  The Supreme Court further stated that if a wrong conclusion on a 
question of law is considered as one reached without lawful authority, there 
is no reason why an erroneous decision on a question of fact should also be 
reckoned as without lawful authority because the defect in both cases 
consists in the mistake in the conclusion reached. The use of the authority to 
make the decision was perfectly legal in each instance. 
39. 
 
In Government of West Pakistan and another v. Begum Agha 
Abdulkarim Shorish Kashmiri (PLD 1969 SC 14), the Supreme Court 
considered the phrases “without lawful authority” and “in an unlawful 
manner” as they occurred in clause (2)(b)(i) of Article 98 of the 1962 
Constitution, ibid. Hamoodur Rahman J. stated: 
 
“… the expressions ‘without lawful authority’ and ‘in an unlawful 
manner’ occurring in sub-clause (b) were not merely tautologous. A 
definite meaning had, therefore, to be given to each of them ... It is agreed 
that without lawful authority, will be comprised all questions of vires of 
the statute itself as also of the person or persons acting under the statute, 
i.e., there must be a competent law authorizing the detention and the 
officer issuing such an order must have been lawfully vested with the 
power. But what is it that falls within the expression unlawful manner? … 
In my view, the words ‘in an unlawful manner’ in sub-clause (b) of Article 
98(1) have been used deliberately to give meaning and content to the 
solemn declaration under Article 1 of the Constitution itself that it is the 
inalienable right of every citizen to be treated in accordance with law and 
only in accordance with law of my mind, therefore in determining as to 
how and in what circumstances a detention would be detention in an 
unlawful manner one would inevitably have first to see whether the action 
is in accordance with law, if not, then it is action in an unlawful manner. 

Writ Petition No. 71548/2022

Law is here not confined to statute law alone but is used in its generic 
sense as connoting all that is treated as law in this country, including even 
the judicial principles laid down from time to time by the superior courts. 
It means according to the accepted forms of legal process and postulates a 
strict performance of all the functions and duties laid down by law.”  
 
 
The Hon’ble Judge further noted that the expression “in an 
unlawful manner” is as comprehensive as the American “due process” 
clause in a new garb. In this sense, a mala fide or colourable action is not 
regarded as an action under the law. Similarly, an action based on 
extraneous or irrelevant considerations or taken on no grounds at all or 
without sufficient application of mind would not qualify as an action in 
accordance with the law. It would, therefore, be struck down as an action 
taken in an unlawful manner. 
40. 
 
In Rahim Shah v. The Chief Election Commissioner of 
Pakistan and another (PLD 1973 SC 24), the Supreme Court held that 
certiorari provides a supervisory control that extends not only to ensure that 
the inferior tribunals stay within their jurisdiction but also to see that they 
follow the law. Certiorari will be issued to any person performing functions 
in connection with the affairs of the Centre, Province or local authority. It is 
not necessary that the “person” acts in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity. 
The High Court will intervene if the act or proceeding violates the law or 
any established legal norm. The term “law” is not confined to “statute”, and 
the superior courts are not restricted to examining the record of the case 
when conducting the inquiry. They even record evidence to determine the 
legality of the act done or the proceedings undertaken. The Supreme Court 
emphasized that although the criteria for granting certiorari followed by 
English Courts do not apply to High Courts in Pakistan, the scope of this 
constitutional jurisdiction cannot be stretched to convert it into an appeal on 
facts or questions of law. Appeals are creatures of statutes, and if the 
Legislature does not permit them, the decisions made by a tribunal with 
exclusive jurisdiction are considered final. 
41. 
 
In Muhammad Husain Munir and others v. Sikandar and 
others (PLD 1974 SC 139), the Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled that the 
phrases “without lawful authority and “of no legal effect” are expressions of 
art that allude to jurisdictional defects as distinguished from a mere 
erroneous decision on a question of fact or even of law. Where a court or a 

Writ Petition No. 71548/2022 
 
 
 
- 16 -
tribunal has jurisdiction and decides a matter, it cannot be said that it acted 
illegally or with material irregularity merely because it reached an incorrect 
result on a question of fact or even of law. The High Court’s supervisory 
jurisdiction 
under 
Article 
98(2)(a)(ii) 
of 
the 
1962 
Constitution  
(or under Article 199(1)(a)(ii) of the Constitution of 1973) is assimilable to 
its jurisdiction under section 115 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) except 
in two important ways: first, the former jurisdiction is a creation of the 
Constitution and thus stands on a higher pedestal than that under section 115 
CPC; second, the former jurisdiction has a wider reach than the jurisdiction 
under section 115 CPC, which is confined to subordinate courts. However, it 
is incorrect to assert that the above Constitutional provision was meant to 
empower the High Court to interfere with the decision of a court or tribunal 
of inferior jurisdiction merely because, in its opinion, the decision is wrong. 
In that case, it would make the High Court’s jurisdiction indistinguishable 
from that exercisable in a full-fledged appeal, which is not the intention of 
the Constitution-makers. 
42. 
 
In Munir Hussain Bhatti, Advocate, and others v. Federation 
of Pakistan and another (PLD 2011 SC 407), the Supreme Court 
approvingly cited the case of the Council of Civil Service Union14 . It held 
that in the judicial review of administrative decisions, the word “lawful” in 
the phrase “without lawful authority” should be interpreted to mean 
illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety.  
43. 
 
It is worth noting that in the case of Utility Stores Corporation 
of Pakistan Limited v. Punjab Labour Appellate Tribunal (PLD 1987 SC 
447), the Supreme Court somewhat deviated from the above-mentioned 
view. It stated that it is incorrect to suggest that when a tribunal is invested 
with jurisdiction over a certain matter, it possesses the power to adjudicate 
on it “rightly or wrongly” because the grant of jurisdiction requires that the 
matter be decided according to the law. Therefore, when the tribunal makes 
an error of law in deciding a case, it goes outside its jurisdiction, and its 
decision can be quashed in writ jurisdiction. Then, in the case of 
Muhammad Lehrasab Khan v. Mst. Aqeel-un-Nisa (2001 SCMR 338), the 
Supreme Court stated that while exercising constitutional jurisdiction, the 
                                          
14 [1984] 3 All ER 935, 950-952

High Court would not ordinarily reappraise the evidence and disturb the 
findings of facts, but it would intervene if such findings were found to be 
based on non-reading or misreading of evidence, erroneous assumptions of 
facts, misapplication of law, excess or abuse of jurisdiction, and arbitrary 
exercise of power. In appropriate cases of special jurisdiction, where the 
District Court is the final appellate court, the High Court can issue a writ of 
certiorari to correct its error if it reverses the trial court’s finding on grounds 
not supported by evidence on record. 
44. 
 
Subsequently, in Shajar Islam v. Muhammad Siddique  
(PLD 2007 SC 45), the Supreme Court revisited this issue and clarified that 
the High Court should not interfere in the findings on controversial questions 
of facts based on evidence, even if such a finding is erroneous. It 
emphasized that the scope of the High Court’s judicial review under Article 
199 of the Constitution is limited to determining whether there is a 
misreading or non-reading of evidence or whether the finding is based on no 
evidence, especially if such errors could result in a miscarriage of justice. It 
is improper for the High Court to overturn factual determinations by 
reappraising evidence in writ jurisdiction or use this jurisdiction as a 
substitute for revision or appeal. In Tayyeba Ambareen and another v. 
Shafqat Ali Kiyani and another (2023 SCMR 246), the Supreme Court held 
that the object of Article 199 of the Constitution is to foster justice, protect 
rights and correct the wrongs. The responsibility for assessing evidence falls 
squarely on the trial court, which holds exclusive jurisdiction in this regard. 
When the lower court’s findings are based on a misreading or non-reading of 
facts, and the order is determined to be arbitrary, perverse, or in violation of 
law or evidence, the High Court might exercise its constitutional jurisdiction 
as a corrective measure. In M. Hamad Hassan v. Mst. Isma Bukhari and 
others (2023 SCMR 1434), the Supreme Court reiterated that constitutional 
jurisdiction cannot be used in place of a revision or an appeal. The High 
Court cannot reappraise the evidence and rule on the facts of the case while 
exercising that power. Its constitutional jurisdiction can only be invoked in 
exceptional circumstances and on limited grounds.  
45. 
 
To sum up, the High Court’s jurisdiction under Article 
199(1)(a)(ii) of the Constitution of 1973 provides supervisory control over 
persons exercising functions related to the business of the Federation, a 

Writ Petition No. 71548/2022 
 
 
 
- 18 -
Province or a local authority. Nonetheless, this jurisdiction is limited to 
determining whether they acted in conformity with the law in performing the 
act or conducting the proceedings. If yes, the High Court will stay its hands 
and not substitute its findings for those of the tribunal. Decisions involving 
bad faith, excess and abuse of jurisdiction, misdirection, failure to follow the 
rules of natural justice and conclusions based on no evidence are treated as 
acts without lawful authority that vitiate the proceedings. 
46. 
 
Having discussed the scope of Article 199(1)(a)(ii) of the 
Constitution, let’s turn to the case at hand. The Petitioner claims that 
Respondents No.5 to 8 removed, or caused to be removed, her original 
operation notes from the patient file to shield themselves from civil and 
criminal liability. As such, the Commission should have exercised its 
authority under section 26(2) of the PHC Act and ordered the registration of 
FIR against them. However, in its reply submitted to this Court, the 
Commission stated that during its inquiry, it found that the notes were 
“misplaced and not destroyed by PCH”. Prima facie, no mens rea on the part 
of Respondents No.5 to 8 (or any of them) has been established. This is a 
factual determination by the Commission. The Petitioner has not alleged that 
there is no evidence to support it. Even otherwise, Dr Atiqa Arshad has 
prepared a duplicate file which the Commission used in its proceedings. The 
Petitioner never questioned their veracity. 
47. 
 
As adumbrated, section 28 of the PHC Act empowers the 
Commission to levy a fine up to Rs.500,000/- for contravention of any 
provision of the Act, and the rules and regulations framed thereunder, 
considering the gravity of the offence. Therefore, section 28 requires two 
assessments: first, ascertaining whether a violation occurred, and second, 
determining the magnitude of the breach and the appropriate monetary 
penalty. Reasons must support both determinations. The Commission found 
that PCH had a poor score (37%) on the MSDS Table and fined it  
Rs. 300,000/-. The impugned order dated 01.11.2021 is silent on how the 
Commission decided on the quantum of the fine. It has an air of arbitrariness 
about it. This imposition is liable to be set aside. 
48. 
 
The Commission has ordered that 20% of the fine imposed be 
given to the Petitioner when recovered. It has exceeded its jurisdiction by 

Writ Petition No. 71548/2022 
 
 
 
- 19 -
issuing such a directive because it lacks a legal foundation. Section 32(1) of 
the PHC Act provides that a Fund shall be established for the purposes of the 
Act, which will be administered and controlled by the Commission. Section 
32(2) delineates the sources for this Fund, which inter alia include any fees, 
penalties and other charges levied under the Act. This means that all fees 
and penalties must be deposited into this Fund. Section 32(3) specifies the 
permissible uses of the Fund, which primarily include expenses related to 
the Commission’s functioning and operations of the Commission, such as 
paying employees, hiring contractors and consultants, purchasing 
equipment, repaying loans, and covering other legitimate expenses. 
Importantly, Section 32 does not grant the Commission the authority to 
utilize the Fund for compensating complainants. 
49. 
 
The Petitioner is also dissatisfied with the Commission’s 
decision to exonerate Respondent No.5 and refer the cases of Respondents 
No.6 and 7 to the Pakistan Medical Commission – which is now pending 
with the relevant committee of Pakistan Medical and Dental Council 
(PMDC) following the enactment of the Act of 2022. However, before 
judging whether the Commission has done so rightly, it is necessary to 
determine the precise scope of the PHC Act and the PMDC Act of 2022 
because both contain clauses relating to medical negligence. 
50. 
 
The PHC Act is a provincial statute. Its objective is to improve 
the quality of healthcare services and to eradicate quackery in the Punjab in 
all its forms and manifestations. On the other hand, the PMDC Act of 2022 
is a federal law that consolidates the law governing the registration of 
medical practitioners and dentists and reconstitutes the Medical and Dental 
Council in Pakistan to establish a uniform minimum standard of basic and 
higher qualifications in medicine and dentistry. In Dr. Riaz Qadeer Khan v. 
Presiding Officer, District Consumer Court, Sargodha, and others  
(PLD 2019 Lahore 429), a Division Bench of this Court observed: 
 
“No doubt the medical profession is a Federal subject but it is only to 
the extent of regulating and educational qualifications and uniformity 
of standards in training and qualification for the purposes of education 
and entry into the profession. In this regard, the Pakistan Medical and 
Dental Council Ordinance, 1962, 15 regulates the minimum standards of 
higher educational qualification in medicine and dentistry. It recognizes 
all medical and dental qualifications whether obtained in Pakistan or 
                                          
15 Now, it is Pakistan Medical and Dental Council Act 2022. 

Writ Petition No. 71548/2022

outside the country. It calls for the registration and licensing of medical 
and dental practitioners and all matters related to the establishment and 
functions of medical and dental institutions, including their recognition, 
are regulated by the PMDC. Hence, any person professing to be a 
medical or dental practitioner must be recognized, registered and 
licensed with the PMDC. It also regulates the institution from which 
the professional degree for qualifying as a doctor or dentist is obtained. 
However, this Ordinance does not regulate any of the healthcare 
services or establishments which will be used by the medical or dental 
practitioners during the process of providing medical or dental services. 
Therefore, it can safely be concluded that healthcare services, 
establishment and service providers do not fall under the subject of the 
medical profession, as such being a provincial subject, are liable to be 
tried and adjudicated upon by the provincial law.” 
51. 
 
Similarly, in Punjab Healthcare Commission v. Mushtaq 
Ahmad Chaudhary and others (PLD 2018 Lahore 762), a Single Judge of 
this Court held that the PHC Act does not regulate the medical profession. 
Instead, it focuses on regulating the provision of healthcare services, 
establishment and service providers. These subjects fall within the ambit of 
public health or healthcare rather than the specific realm of the medical 
profession. 
52. 
 
Section 19 of the PHC Act addresses the issue of medical 
negligence. It reads as follows: 
19. Medical negligence.— (1) Subject to sub-section (2), a healthcare 
service provider may be held guilty of medical negligent on one of the 
following two findings:-- 
(a) 
the healthcare establishment does not have the requisite 
human resources and equipments which it professes to have 
possessed; or 
(b) 
he or any of his employees did not, in the given case, 
exercise with reasonable competence the skill which he or 
his employee did possess. 
(2) 
The recognized and known complications of a medical or surgical 
treatment are not considered as medical negligence. 
53. 
 
The term “healthcare service provider” is defined in section 
2(xvii) of the PHC Act, which I have reproduced in footnote 2, supra. 
According to that definition, it encompasses medical practitioners. “The 
general scheme of healthcare law and clinical governance requires 
efficiency, responsibility and accountability at every level where healthcare 
is provided. Hence, the practitioner, the services, the establishment and the 
service provider are all regulated to ensure that the healthcare works at its 
optimum for the benefit of the people.”16

54. 
 
The PMDC Act of 2022 deals with medical negligence in 
section 44, which is reproduced below: 
 
44. Removal of names from the register.—(1) The Council, in its 
discretion, may direct the registrar to remove altogether or for a specified 
period from the register the name of any registered medical practitioner or 
registered dentist who has been convicted by the disciplinary committee or 
by any other court of law of any such offence as implies in the opinion of 
the Council a defect of character defined in the code of ethics of practice 
or who, after an inquiry at which opportunity has been given to such 
person to be heard in person or through a pleader, has been convicted by 
the disciplinary committee of the Council as guilty of professional 
negligence or incompetence in a patient-doctor scenario in clinical setting 
or who has shown himself to be unfit to continue in practice or on account 
of mental ill health or other grounds as prescribed in the code of ethics of 
practice regulations and the complaint and matter shall finish if the 
complainant withdraws his complaint.  
(2)  
The Council may also direct that any name removed from the 
register under sub-section (1) shall be restored.  
(3) 
 … 
(4)  
The claim of professional negligence shall initially be established 
before the disciplinary committee of the Council before any other 
proceedings. 
55. 
 
Section 44 of the Act of 2022 allows PMDC to remove a 
medical practitioner’s name from the register entirely or for a specified 
period in the following circumstances: (i) if he is convicted by its 
disciplinary committee of professional negligence or incompetence in a 
patient-doctor scenario in clinical setting; (ii)  if he is unfit to continue in 
practice because of mental ill health; (iii) if he is unfit to continue in practice 
on other grounds mentioned in the code of ethics. Section 44 provides a 
mechanism for good “housekeeping” and maintaining the minimum standard 
of practice which the Act aims to promote and preserve.  
56. 
 
Section 19 of the PHC Act and section 44 of the PMDC Act of 
2022 seem to overlap on the issue of medical negligence, but they do not. 
Section 44 can be invoked only when the alleged medical negligence is so 
grave that it raises the question of whether the medical practitioner 
concerned should be allowed to continue his practice. 
57. 
 
The Commission has a legal obligation to decide all complaints 
of medical negligence filed against healthcare service providers. Section 28 
empowers it to levy a fine up to Rs. 500,000/-, depending upon the gravity 
of negligence, if the accusation is proven.  Section 26(2) of the PHC Act 
stipulates that if the Commission deems that the facts of a case require action 
under another law, it may refer the matter to the competent governmental 

Writ Petition No. 71548/2022 
 
 
 
- 22 -
authorities or law enforcement agencies for appropriate action under the 
relevant laws. It could entail a referral to the PMDC and registration of a 
criminal case. In this regard, the Commission must inter alia follow the 
principles elucidated by this Court in Dr. Nafeesa Saleem and another v. 
Justice of Peace and others (PLD 2022 Lahore 18). 
58. 
 
In the present case, the Commission found no lapse on the part 
of Respondent No.5, so it decided not to proceed against her. It has given 
extensive reasoning for this decision in the impugned order dated 
01.11.2021. The Petitioner’s counsel has failed to persuade this Court that it 
is flawed. However, the action against Respondents No. 6 and 7 is open to 
objection. Regulation 6 of the Complaint Management Regulations 2014 
mandates the Commission to rule on all complaints, inter alia those 
involving medical negligence, malpractice or failure to provide adequate 
healthcare services. Section 28 of the PHC Act, in conjunction with 
Regulation 23, empowers the Commission to impose a fine if a complaint is 
successful. In this matter, the Commission has referred the cases of 
Respondents No.6 and 7 to PMDC without recording any findings. It has 
thus abdicated its jurisdiction. The Assistant Advocate General attempted to 
justify this course by arguing that the Commission required further inquiry 
to determine their culpability. This argument is not tenable. Regulations 15 
and 16 of the 2014 Regulations provide for consultation with experts. In the 
present case, the Commission sought opinions from one neurologist and two 
anaesthesiologists. If it needed more assistance to decide on the guilt of 
Respondents No. 6 and 7, it could have consulted additional experts. The 
matter must, therefore, be remanded to it. 
59. 
 
While hearing this case, this Court has observed some very 
serious issues in the healthcare delivery system in the province. The 
Healthcare Commission’s regulatory purview ranges from public and private 
sector establishments to trust hospitals and autonomous healthcare 
organizations, including multi-disciplinary and single-speciality hospitals, 
clinical laboratories and diagnostic centres, clinics of general and family 
practitioners, Rural Health Centres, Basic Health Units, homoeopathic 
clinics, dental clinics, matabs, nursing homes, maternity centres, 
physiotherapy clinics, acupuncture clinics, etc. In addition, all other 
premises being wholly or partially used for providing healthcare services 

Writ Petition No. 71548/2022 
 
 
 
- 23 -
and declared by the Government as “healthcare establishments” also fall 
within the Commission’s jurisdiction. It has developed a comprehensive 
registration and licensing system to regulate all healthcare establishments 
and service providers. It has set minimum service delivery standards 
(MSDS) for all categories and all levels of health services. Each MSDS has 
a number of indicators. The Punjab Government approved these MSDS in 
October 2017. Setting service delivery standards and indicators is an 
established practice in various countries for continually improving the 
quality of service delivery in the health sector. The Commission has 
classified the healthcare establishments into the following three categories: 
1.  
Category I HCEs 
 
Hospitals with a bed strength of 50 and above. 
2.  
Category II HCEs 
 
I. 
Category II A HCEs (hospitals with 31-49 beds). 
 
II. 
Category II B HCEs (hospitals with 16-30 beds). 
III. 
Category II C HCEs (hospitals upto 15 beds). 
IV. 
Rural Health Centers (RHCs) (public sector HCEs with 10-20 beds). 
3.

Since MSDS was a new regime, the Commission decided to 
facilitate the healthcare establishments and service providers by giving them 
reasonable time to comply. It issues provisional licences under section 16(1) 
of the PHC Act to those healthcare establishments that meet the Critical 
Patient Safety Areas (CPSA) requirements. The following is the detail of the 
said CPSA areas:

Granting a provisional licence to any healthcare establishment 
does not imply that it has complied with the relevant standards.17 Before 
issuing a regular licence, the Commission must ensure that it has complied 
with the PHC Act, Regulations and Standards and any instructions and/or 
corrective orders issued by it following the survey and/or the inspection 
report. In other words, cent per cent implementation of MSDS by healthcare 
establishments is mandatory. 
62. 
 
It is pertinent that the PHC Act does not stipulate any time limit 
within which the healthcare establishment must apply for a regular licence. 
As a result, these establishments continue to operate indefinitely under a 
provisional licence. PCH is a classic example. On 20.09.2017, Respondent 
No.8, its owner/administrator, applied to the Commission for registration 
under section 13 of the PHC Act. The Commission issued Registration 
Certificate No.R-41548 to PCH on 08.02.2018 and a provisional licence on 
13.02.2018 under Category II-B (26-bed hospitals). The Commission 
inspected PCH to determine its eligibility for the grant of a regular licence 
on 13.12.2019. It scored 52% on the MSDS table and thus could not qualify. 
It conducted the second inspection on 21.10.2020, in which PCH failed 
again, although it showed 81% compliance. In the third inspection 
conducted on 11.06.2021, its score dipped to 38%, and in the fourth 
                                          
17 Regulation 11(4) of the Punjab Healthcare Commission Licensing Regulations 2020.

inspection held on 26.11.2021, it surged to 70%. PCH did not qualify for a 
regular licence because a perfect 100% score is required. Astonishingly, 
even after about 5½ years of registration, the Commission has no objection 
to its functioning on a provisional licence if it improves its score to 70%. 
The penultimate paragraph of the impugned order dated 01.11.2021 reads as 
follows: 
 
“The respondent [PCH] is further directed to improve its score up to 70% 
within three weeks, failing which necessary action shall be taken in 
accordance with law.” 
63. 
 
It is trite that where the law does not prescribe a time limit for 
performing a duty, it must be completed within a reasonable time. Reliance 
is placed on Chairman, Regional Transport Authority, Rawalpindi v. 
Pakistan Mutual Insurance Company Limited (PLD 1991 SC 14), 
Mushtaq Ahmed Sabto and others v. Federation of Pakistan and others 
[2001 PLC (C.S.) 623]. Allowing a healthcare establishment to operate on 
the basis of a provisional licence for an indefinite period is against the object 
and spirit of the PHC Act. The Provincial Government/ Commission must 
address this issue on priority. 
64. 
 
Although vaginal delivery is a safe and low-cost method of 
delivery, a C-section may become necessary for medical reasons. 
Nonetheless, it is costly and sometimes creates health challenges for women 
and their newborns. The World Health Organization recommends that  
C-section rates should not exceed 10% or fall below 5%. The Commission 
has apprised this Court that the rate of C-sections in our country has risen 
alarmingly over the last decade, becoming a major public health issue. There 
are complaints that it is done even when not required. According to the 
survey conducted by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, the C-section delivery 
rate is 22%. It has rapidly increased from 14% in 2012-13 to 22% in  
2017-18.

Status of Sehat Sahulat Programme regarding C-sections 
 
 
Around 800 hospitals are accredited under the Punjab Sehat 
Sahulat Programme. According to the Punjab Health Initiative Management 
Company statistics, 585,795 females insured with PHIMC gave birth in 
2022-2023. Among these, 22% were normal deliveries, and 78% were C-
sections. The percentage of regular deliveries is slightly better in public 
sector hospitals than in private hospitals.

There are three major reasons for the dismal state of affairs 
depicted by the above-mentioned statistics. These are the financial gains, 
consultant's convenience, and client/patient preference. The C-sections that 
are not medically necessary and are performed for the first two 
considerations are unethical and constitute professional misconduct and 
malpractice. As regards the patient’s preference, it must be established that 
she gave informed consent. The Commission was required to set appropriate

standards to regulate this area of healthcare services but has not done it so 
far. The Technical Advisory Committee formed under section 10 of the PHC 
Act has also failed to make any recommendations. 
67. 
 
International law recognizes the right to health as a human right 
and basic to the happiness, harmonious relations and security of all 
peoples.18 It is also important because human rights are interdependent, 
indivisible and interrelated. Violation of the right to health may impair the 
enjoyment of other human rights, e.g. the rights to education, work and 
family life.19 Article 9 of the Constitution of Pakistan (1973) protects the 
right to life as a fundamental right which has been interpreted to include all 
facets of human existence.20 The right to health and, by extension, the right 
to healthcare is concomitant to the right to life.21 It can also be read into the 
right to dignity of man guaranteed by Article 14 of the Constitution. 
68. 
 
This Court is the guardian of the people’s fundamental rights. 
Therefore, the following directives are issued: 
(i) 
The Provincial Government and the Commission shall 
take appropriate steps to ensure that the healthcare 
establishments do not operate on provisional licences for 
an indefinite period and specify a time frame within 
which they must get a regular licence.  
(ii)  
The Commission must enhance its capacity to discharge 
its duties under the PHC Act. The Government is 
directed to allocate funds necessary for that purpose.  
(iii) 
The Commission shall forthwith develop standards to 
regulate healthcare services relating to C-section 
procedures in consultation with a technical advisory 
committee, 
the 
Society 
of 
Obstetricians 
and 
Gynecologists Pakistan (SOPGP), the Pakistan Society of 
Anesthesiologists (PSA), and other stakeholders. It shall 
ensure that the entire process is completed within 90 days 
from the announcement of this judgment.  
(iv) 
The aforementioned standards shall, in particular, 
develop a mechanism for clinical audit of all C-sections 
done in the province.

(v) 
All consultants and healthcare establishments shall 
submit separate statements/reports every six months 
giving details of the C-sections they performed during 
that period. The Commission shall conduct a compulsory 
clinical audit of all healthcare establishments and 
consultants whose figures exceed the WHO rate.  
Disposition of the main case 
69. 
 
The District Judge’s judgment dated 12.10.2022 on the 
Petitioner’s appeal is upheld. 
70. 
 
The Commission’s decision to exonerate Respondent No.5 is 
maintained. However, the matter is remanded to it (i) to judiciously  
re-determine the fine for PCH (Prime Care Hospital), giving reasons to 
justify it, and (ii) to determine whether Respondents No.6 and 7 committed 
any medical negligence and whether it was serious enough to warrant 
referral to the PMDC for action under the PMDC Act of 2022. 
71. 
 
The Petitioner cannot be paid any compensation out of the fine 
imposed on PCH. The entire sum, when recovered, must be deposited in the 
Fund established under section 32(1) of the PHC Act. Nonetheless, she 
would be free to pursue any legal remedies against PCH. 
72. 
 
PCH is directed to complete all the prescribed requirements 
within two months and obtain regular licence. If it fails, the Commission 
shall take action against it according to the law.
