Versus 
Additional District Judge etc.

Date of hearing: 
11.12.2024 
Petitioner by: 
Mr. Afzaal Ahmed Mudaher, Advocate. 
Respondent No.3 
by: 
Rana Rizwan Ahmed, Advocate. 
 
Faisal Zaman Khan, J:- Through this petition, judgments dated 
09.10.2023 and 09.01.2024 passed by respondent Nos.2 and 1, 
respectively, have been assailed. By virtue of the former judgment, a 
guardianship petition under Section 25 of the Guardian and Wards Act, 
1890 (Act) filed by respondent No.3 against the petitioner has been 
allowed and through the latter, the same has been upheld. 
2. 
Facts giving rise to the present petition are that marriage 
between the petitioner and respondent No.3 was solemnized on 
14.10.2011 and from the wedlock, one daughter namely Sidra Asif 
alias Taha Mubeen (minor) was born. The marriage between the 
spouses was dissolved whereupon a guardianship petition under 
Section 25 of the Act was filed by respondent No.3 against the 
petitioner in which a reply was filed by the latter. Out of divergent 
pleadings of the parties, 03 issues were framed, evidence pro and 
contra was led, whereafter through judgment dated 09.10.2023, the 

WP No. 997/2024-BWP  
 
2 
guardianship petition was allowed. Feeling aggrieved, petitioner filed 
an appeal which was dismissed through judgment dated 09.01.2024, 
therefore, this petition. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that on extraneous 
consideration, the guardianship petition has been allowed without 
determining the welfare of the minor which is of paramount 
consideration. He further submits that since the parties have remarried, 
therefore, their disqualification is equal, hence the petitioner cannot be 
held to be disentitled for custody of the minor on this score alone. He 
also submits that mere age of the minor cannot be a barometer to 
determine her custody.  
4. 
Replying to the above, learned counsel for respondent No.3 
submits that petitioner is a multi-married women thus under the 
Muhammadan Law she become disentitled to retain the custody of the 
minor. Further submits that since the minor is 12 years of age, 
therefore, in view of her growing age, her stay with the husband of 
petitioner, who is not related to the minor, would be illegal. He asserts 
that the petitioner while appearing as RW.1 has admitted that the minor 
is living with her maternal grandparents (and not with the petitioner). 
He also asserts that petitioner has no means to maintain the minor. 
Lastly submits that paramount consideration in custody cases is 
welfare of the minor and the other facts are subordinate to the same 
and since the welfare lie with the respondent, hence the courts below 
have rightly decided in his favour. Places reliance on the judgments 
reported as Shabana Naz v. Muhammad Saleem (2014 SCMR 343), 
Mst. Nazir v. Hafiz Ghulam Mustafa etc. (1981 SCMR 200), Dr. 
Muhammad Asif v. Additional District Judge, Layyah and others (2024 
CLC 1520), Abdul Ghaffar v. Shoukat (2022 YLR 2482), Dewan 
Abdullah Ahmed Farooqui v. Court of Family Judge South Saddar 
Karachi and another (2022 YLR 2095), Naghma Rani v. Additional 
District Judge, Gujrat and 3 others (2018 CLC 767), Muhammad 
Alam v. Nazish Qazi and 2 others (2018 YLR 1771) and Mst. Bushra 

WP No. 997/2024-BWP  
 
3 
Mughal v. Additional District Judge, Kharian and others (1999 MLD 
2960). On a Court’s query, learned counsel submits that respondent 
No.3 has also remarried.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
6. 
It has been settled by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
judgments reported as Shaista Habib v. Muhammad Arif Habib and 
others (PLD 2024 SC 629) Rashid Hussain v. Additional District 
Judge, Islamabad (East) and others (PLD 2022 S.C. 32), Shabana Naz 
v. Muhammad Saleem (2014 SCMR 343), Mehmood Akhtar v. District 
Judge, Attock and 2 others (2004 SCMR 1839), Badruddin Roshan v. 
Mst. Razia Sultana and another (2002 SCMR 371) and Mst. Nighat 
Firdous v. Khadim Hussain (1998 SCMR 1593) that the primary and 
the foremost consideration for taking a decision qua custody of minors 
is their welfare. 
7. 
The cumulative reading of the above judgments would show that 
there are many factors, which are required to be considered by the 
courts for determining the welfare of the minor, which include the age, 
sex and religion of the minor, character and capacity of the proposed 
guardian, his/her nearness of the kin with the minor, wishes, if any, of 
the deceased parents (if the parents of the minors are not alive) and the 
existing relationship of the proposed guardian with the minor. Apart 
from the above, the court can consider the intelligent preference of the 
minor, if the minor is old enough. It has also been held in the above 
judgments that the courts while determining the welfare can ignore the 
fact that father is the natural guardian, whereas, the mother has the 
right of Hizanat. 
8. 
A perusal of the impugned judgment passed by respondent No.2 
would show that the main factor which found force with the courts 
below in granting custody of the minor to respondent No.3 is that after 
the dissolution of marriage between the parties, petitioner has married 

WP No. 997/2024-BWP  
 
4 
multiple times and this is a bad omen for the upbringing of the minor 
as she will also follow her footsteps. 
9. 
In the above backdrop and keeping in view the facts of the 
present case, since both the parties have remarried, therefore, they 
suffer from the same disqualification. Even otherwise, while analyzing 
such circumstances, it has been held by the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
in judgment reported as Mst. Qurat-ulAin v. Station House Officer, 
Police Station Saddar Jalalpur Jattan District Gujrat and others (2024 
SCMR 486) that remarriage, especially of a mother, does not disentitle 
her to retain the custody of the minor.  
10. 
In the attending circumstances, since both the parties have 
remarried therefore the paramount consideration for granting the 
custody will be the welfare of the minor. 
11. 
In the above background, a perusal of the available record would 
show that no circumstance has been highlighted by respondent No.3 
wherefrom this could be culled out that petitioner is a delinquent 
mother and is not upbringing the minor properly. Keeping the welfare 
of the minor in consideration especially so when she is knocking the 
door of adolescence and with physical and hormonal changes  to 
follow she will be having an altogether new experience and to coup 
with the changes she shall be requiring continuous advice for which 
who else can be a better advisor than the real mother as compared to 
the step mother, step sisters or paternal grandmother, what to talk of 
respondent No.3, thus in the attending circumstances of the case in 
hand, same lie with the petitioner as she is the real mother as compared 
to the father, step mother, 4 step sisters and paternal grandmother. 
12. 
Available record would further reflect that the courts below 
without considering the above factors and without determining that as 
to whether petitioner is delinquent in upbringing of the minor or her 
interest is adverse to that of the minor or quoting any incident that the 

WP No. 997/2024-BWP  
 
5 
behavior of the step father is detrimental towards the minor have erred 
in law in handing over the custody of the minor to respondent No.3. 
13. 
It is strange to note that respondent No.2 while deciding the 
guardianship petition has observed that since petitioner has married 
multiple times, thus this conduct of her will be detrimental for the 
upbringing of the minor as the “daughters always follow the footsteps 
of the mother” (see paragraph No.15 of the judgment). The court lost 
sight of the fact that it is a court of law and not an expert of behavioral 
science or a psychologist so as to render such opinion. The courts 
below did not consider the fact that respondent No.3 has also married 
thrice, however, no observation has been made about his conduct.  
14. 
This Court is of the view that the above observations can at best 
be the figment of imagination of respondent No.2, however, since it is 
not backed by any law or evidence, thus the same is of no value and 
effect. 
15. 
With regard to the argument of learned counsel for respondent 
No.3 that the petitioner does not have sufficient financial sources for 
upbringing of the minor, it has been held by the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in judgment reported as Mst. Beena v. Raja Muhammad and 
others (PLD 2020 S.C. 508), Mir Bat Khan v. Mst. Sherin Bibi and 
others (2019 SCMR 520) and Mst. Razia Bibi v. Riaz Ahmad and 
another (2004 SCMR 821) that poverty of a mother does not disentitle 
her from retaining/seeking custody of the minor. 
16. 
As regards the disqualification of the petitioner keeping in view 
the provisions of Muhammadan Law, it has been held by the Federal 
Shariat Court in the judgment reported as Messrs Najaat Welfare 
Foundation through General Secretary v. Federation of Pakistan 
through Secretary Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, 
Islamabad and 4 others (PLD 2021 FSC 1) that Muhammadan Law by 
D.F.Mullah is a reference book and is not a statue having binding force 
thus Muhammadan Law can only be consulted as a reference book and 

WP No. 997/2024-BWP  
 
6 
cannot be termed to be statutory law having binding effect, upon which 
any presumption can be drawn against a person. 
17. 
Last but not the least, since the minor is a 12 years old girl, 
therefore, in order to seek her preference she was ordered to appear 
before the Court whereupon she appeared in person today and from her 
appearance, she seemed impressionable and receptive thus in order to 
determine her intelligent preference, she was posed certain questions 
which she answered intelligently and with confidence. She has been 
asked that with whom she is residing and wishes to stay with, upon 
which she in categoric and in unequivocal terms has shown her 
preference to live with the petitioner, her real mother with whom she at 
present is residing.   
18. 
In the above circumstances, since the minor being mature 
enough to make an intelligence preference has acknowledged that she 
is living with the petitioner, her real mother and continues to live with 
her, therefore, despite the fact that petitioner while appearing as a 
witness deposed that the minor is living with her maternal 
grandparents, the said admission is of no effect as at present, the minor 
is living with the petitioner. 
19. 
As regards the judgments cited by the learned counsel for 
respondent No.3 they also spell out that for custody of minors the 
paramount consideration is their welfare, however, the remaining 
findings in those judgments are with regard to the facts and 
circumstances of those cases, hence, they are distinguishable. 
20. 
For what has been discussed above, since the courts below erred 
in law in not determining the welfare of the minor in its proper 
perspective and on extraneous considerations passed the impugned 
judgments thus this petition is allowed as a consequence to which the 
impugned judgments are set aside, resultantly, the guardianship 
petition under Section 25 of the Act filed by respondent No.3 stands 
dismissed, however, respondent No.3 is at liberty to approach the 

WP No. 997/2024-BWP  
 
7 
guardian court with an application for chalking out a schedule for 
meeting with the minor.
