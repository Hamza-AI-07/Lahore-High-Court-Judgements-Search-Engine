Feeling aggrieved by the judgment of the learned trial court, 
Shazam Ali, the appellant, has assailed his conviction by filing the instant 
jail appeal bearing Criminal Appeal No.26723-J of 2019. The learned trial 
court also referred M.R. No.82 of 2019 (The State. Vs. Shazam Ali) for 
confirmation of the death sentence awarded to the appellant-Shazam Ali. 
Both the matters arising out of the same judgment of the learned trial court 
are being disposed of through a single judgment. 
3. 
 
Briefly, the prosecution story as alleged in the private 
complaint (Ex. PB) of Shahanshah Abdul Rehman (PW-1)-the complainant 
is that on 30.03.2017, at about 09:00 A.M., complainant’s brother, namely, 
Shafique-ur-Rehman along with passengers came at his workshop on his Car 
XLI bearing No.LEE-5777 black colour, situated at G.T Road, Barkat Town 
Shahdara, Lahore, asked the complainant to check the vehicle’s oil and 
water, etc. and told him that he was going to Gujranwala along with 
passengers. The complainant (PW-1) saw the three passengers sitting in the 
car. After that, his brother left for Gujranwala. At about 01:00 P.M., 
Muhammad Zubair (PW-6) informed the complainant through telephone that 
some unknown persons, during the snatching of a car and dacoity, 
committed the murder of the complainant’s brother near Vanianwala 
Gujranwala, whereas one accused was arrested in injured condition and was 
shifted to DHQ Hospital Gujranwala. The complainant reached DHQ 
Hospital, Gujranwala, and firstly, saw the dead body of his elder brother and 
then saw the accused in injured condition and immediately identified that the 
injured accused was one of the said three passengers who, in the morning 
while taking complainant’s brother had come to Gujranwala, whose name 
was later on known as Shazam Ali son of Asghar Ali, caste Awan, resident 
of Main Bazaar, Rana Town and was arrested by the concerned police in 
injured condition. The accused, Shazam Ali, son of Asghar Ali, and two 
unknown accused persons murdered the complainant’s brother through 
pistol fire while snatching a car and dacoity.      
4. 
 
The complainant Shahanshah Abdul Rehman (PW-1), got 
recorded his statement (Ex. PA) to Raza Rehman T-A.S.I. (PW-7), who, 

Murder Reference No.82 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.26723-J of 2019

chalked out formal FIR (Ex.PA/1). After the registration of the case, the 
investigation of this case was conducted by Manzar Saeed S.I (CW-1), who 
found the accused/appellant guilty and prepared a report under section 173 
of Cr.P.C. Being dissatisfied with the result of the investigation, as the 
investigating officer being in league with the accused did not investigate the 
matter properly, the complainant was constrained to file a private complaint 
(Ex. PB). After recording the cursory evidence of the complainant and 
having perused the record, all the accused persons were found connected 
with the commission of the offence, so they were summoned to face the 
charge. After that, the learned trial court formally charged the appellant and 
his co-accused on 05.11.2018, to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed 
trial. The complainant, in support of his version produced as many as nine 
(09) witnesses, whereas the investigating officer appeared as C.W-1.  
5. 
 
Ocular account/last seen evidence, in this case, has come out 
from the statements of Shahanshah Abdul Rehman (PW-1)-the complainant, 
Malik Muhammad Raza (PW-2)-the eye witness, and Muhammad Imtiaz 
(PW-3)-the eye witness. Whereas, Dr. Hassan Ihsan CMO (PW-9), who 
conducted the postmortem examination of Shafique-ur-Rehman (the 
deceased), found the following injuries on his person: -

After conducting the postmortem examination, the 
doctor opined that death, in this case, had occurred due to 
cardiopulmonary arrest consequent to injury No.9, which had 
damaged the left lung, stomach, left kidney, and intestine. The 
left lung was a vital organ, and any injury to it was sufficient to 
cause death under the ordinary course of nature. All these 
injuries were ante-mortem in nature. The probable time 
between injuries and death was immediate, and between death 
and postmortem was approximately 12 to 24 hours. 
The statements of the remaining prosecution witnesses are formal in nature.  
6. 
 
The learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor gave up PW-
Munawar Hussain as unnecessary and closed the prosecution evidence after 
tendering the reports of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (Ex PJ, Ex. PK 
& Ex. PL).

The appellant was also examined under Section 342 Cr.P.C., 
wherein he neither opted to appear as his witness under section 340(2) 
Cr.P.C nor produced any evidence in his defence. In response to a particular 
question that why this case was against him and why the PWs deposed 
against him, the appellant made the following deposition: -                     
“The case is false one against me. In fact, the 
unknown accused stopped the car and attempted to 
snatch the car by the dint of the deadly weapons. The 
deceased 
Shafique-ur-Rehman 
resisted 
to 
the 
unknown accused and in such situation, the unknown 
accused injured me and committed murder of 
Shafique-ur-Rehman (deceased). The police could not 
find the unknown real culprits. The police after 
taking the bribe and in order to conceal inefficiency 
on their part and to end the investigation proceeding 
of the case, involved me falsely in this case on the 
basis of suspicion with the connivance of the 
complainant. I asked one passerby namely Rana 
Liaqat at the spot to make phone call to the rescue-
1122. Said Rana Liaqat made phone call and in 
pursuance of the said phone call, 1122 force arrived at 
the spot and took me and Shafique-ur-Rehman 
(deceased) to the DHQ Hospital, Gujranwala. Except 
myself, no other person witnessed the occurrence. I 
am innocent in this case. PWs are close friends of the 
complainant and they have deposed falsely against me 
with the connivance of the complainant. The PWs 
have also taken the bribe from the complainant for 
deposing against me.” 
 
8. 
 
After recording the statement under section 342 Cr.P.C, learned 
counsel for the appellant filed an application for summoning Mubeen 
Ahmad, Ijaz, and Irfan members of rescue 1122 force as court witnesses by 
alleging that they brought the accused/appellant and the deceased to DHQ 
Hospital, Gujranwala from the place of occurrence and they were important 
witnesses. The learned trial court accepted the application, and the PWs 
above were summoned on 11.03.2019. After recording statements of Ijaz 
Ahmad (CW-2), Mubeen (CW-3), and Irfan Ali (CW-4), again gist of the 
evidence was put to the appellant in his subsequent statement under section 
342 of Cr.P.C., which was recorded on 14.03.2019 and while replying to the 

Murder Reference No.82 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.26723-J of 2019 
 
6
question that why the CWs had deposed against him, the appellant made the 
following deposition:- 
“CW-2 Ijaz Ahmad, Emergency Medical Technician 
of 1122 Force, CW-3 Mubeen Emergency Medical 
Technician of 1122 Force and CW-4 Irfan Ali Driver 
of 1122 Force have deposed against me with the 
connivance of the complainant.” 
9. 
 
After evaluating the evidence available on record in light of 
arguments advanced from both sides, the learned trial court found the 
prosecution version proved beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt, which 
resulted in the appellant’s conviction in the afore-stated terms. 
10. 
 
We have given our anxious and most thoughtful consideration 
to both sides’ rival submissions. We have minutely gone through the 
evidence on record.  
11. 
 
The prosecution’s case in a narrow compass is that the accused, 
Shazam Ali (the appellant), tried to snatch the car bearing registration 
No.LEE-5777 and, while committing robbery, caused firearm injuries to 
Shafique-ur-Rehman, the deceased. The said incident was alleged to have 
been committed on 30.03.2017 in Vanianwala, which falls within the 
jurisdiction of police station Aroop, District Gujranwala. In the case of the 
prosecution, Shazam Ali (the appellant), his co-accused Ghulam Murtaza 
(since acquitted), and an unknown accused, in furtherance of their common 
intention, committed the occurrence and, while doing so, murdered 
Shafique-ur-Rehman. It is further the prosecution case that the accused, 
Shazam Ali, received an injury during the incident and was shifted to Civil 
Hospital, Gujranwala. There, the police took him into their custody. 
Shahanshah Abdul Rehman (PW-1)-the complainant stated that on 
30.03.2017 at about 09:00 a.m, his elder brother, Shafique-ur-Rehman came 
to his workshop situated at Barkat Town, Shahadara, Lahore in the car XLI 
bearing No.LEE-5777 of black colour driven on a rental basis in the 
company of passengers before departure from Lahore to Gujranwala for 
checking the oil and water of the car. His brother, Shafique-ur-Rehman, 
went to Gujranwala along with the passengers. The defence has not disputed 

Murder Reference No.82 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.26723-J of 2019 
 
7
this fact during the cross-examination. Shahanshah Abdul Rehman (PW-1)-
the complainant, received information about the murder of his elder brother 
Shafique-ur-Rehman and the arrest of one person in an injured condition on 
30.03.2017 at 01:00 p.m. The information was given to him by Zubair Butt. 
The statement made by Shahanshah Abdul Rehman (PW-1)-the 
complainant, gets corroboration from a statement that was brought on the 
record by the defence from the witness Muhammad Zubair (PW-6). 
Muhammad Zubair (PW-6) deposed during cross-examination that he 
provided information about the murder of Shafique-ur-Rehman, the 
deceased, to Shahanshah Abdul Rehman (PW-1)-the complainant. 
Muhammad Zubair (PW-6) deposed during cross-examination: 
 “I was informed at about 01:00 p.m. about the 
murder 
of 
Shafique-ur-Rehman 
(deceased). 
I 
informed Shahanshah Abdul Rehman, complainant 
after seeking the information regarding the murder at 
01:00 p.m.”  
In this regard, this fact was got reaffirmed by the defence from Shahanshah 
Abdul Rehman (PW-1)-the complainant, who deposed as under:  
“PW Zubair informed me that he made the phone call 
from DHQ Hospital, Gujranwala, at about 01:00 p.m. 
I reached the DHQ Hospital, Gujranwala at, about 
02:00/02:30 P.M. Zubair and other relatives met me 
in the hospital. ------------When I heard the phone call, 
I was informed that one accused person was captured 
in an injured condition. -------No consultation was 
made by me with the police with reference to the 
registration of the case.” 
Besides, Shahanshah Abdul Rehman (PW-1)-the complainant, deposed 
during examination-in-chief that: 
“One accused, who was in injured condition, was also 
in the hospital. I saw the injured accused and 
identified him. He was amongst the three passengers 
who were sitting in the car of my brother when he 
came at my workshop. The name of the said accused 
was known to me as Shazam Ali son of Asghar Ali.”  
The witness was examined by the learned defence counsel, and the defence 
has not cross-examined these facts. Learned counsel for the appellant has not 
challenged the date, time, place of occurrence, presence of accused/appellant 

Murder Reference No.82 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.26723-J of 2019 
 
8
Shazam Ali in the car on the front seat in injured condition, and receiving of 
injuries by the deceased in the car and fall outside the vehicle. He has 
challenged the veracity and credibility of the prosecution witnesses, 
Muhammad Raza (PW-2) and Muhammad Imtiaz (PW-3). We examined the 
testimony of the prosecution witnesses, namely, Malik Muhammad Raza 
(PW-2) and Muhammad Imtiaz (PW-3). We found that both these witnesses 
are not related, and we were not considering their testimonies for deciding 
the instant appeal. However, Shahanshah Abdul Rehman (PW-1)-the 
complainant, has deposed that accused/appellant Shazam Ali, along with two 
others (as stated above), committed the incident, were sitting in the car as 
passengers, driven by his brother on a rental basis, and the defence did not 
deny this fact. The evidence of Shahanshah Abdul Rehman (PW-1)-the 
complainant to the extent of his last seen evidence and identification of 
accused Shazam Ali, could not be shaken by the defence. However, he was 
subjected to lengthy cross-examination. Manzar Saeed S.I. (CW-1)-the 
investigating officer also deposed during his examination-in-chief that, after 
the entrustment of investigation, he (CW-1), along with other police officials 
reached DHQ Hospital, Gujranwala, inspected the dead body of Shafique-ur-
Rehman (deceased), prepared injury statement (Ex.CW-1/A) and inquest 
report (Ex.CW-1/C) of the deceased and also prepared the injury statement 
(Ex.CW-1/D) of Shazam Ali-the appellant, who was admitted in the 
Emergency Ward of DHQ Hospital. He arrested the appellant-Shazam Ali, 
on 18.05.2017. The defence put suggestions to Shahanshah Abdul Rehman 
(PW-1)-the complainant. During cross-examination, the witness (PW-1) 
denied the suggestions put by the defence and stated that: 
 “It is incorrect that unknown persons had committed 
the murder of my brother Shafique-ur-Rehman and 
in the said occurrence accused Shazam was injured. It 
is incorrect that the real accused were not found and 
the accused Shazam was involved in this case falsely. 
It is incorrect that accused Shazm had not committed 
the murder of Shafique-ur-Rehman and nothing was 
recovered from him. It is incorrect that accused 
Shazam is innocent in this case.”

This was the defence put to the prosecution witness i.e., Shahanshah Abdul 
Rehman (PW-1)-the complainant. Whereas, the accused/appellant took a 
specific plea while replying to the question of why this case was against you, 
put before him during his statement under section 342 of Cr.P.C., as under: - 
“The case is false one against me. In fact, the 
unknown accused stopped the car and attempted to 
snatch the car by the dint of the deadly weapons. The 
deceased 
Shafique-ur-Rehman 
resisted 
to 
the 
unknown accused and in such situation, the unknown 
accused injured me and committed murder of 
Shafique-ur-Rehman (deceased). The police could not 
find the unknown real culprits. The police after 
taking the bribe and in order to conceal inefficiency 
on their part and to end the investigation proceeding 
of the case, involved me falsely in this case on the 
basis of suspicion with the connivance of the 
complainant. I asked one passerby namely Rana 
Liaqat at the spot to make phone call to the rescue-
1122. Said Rana Liaqat made phone call and in 
pursuance of the said phone call, 1122 force arrived at 
the spot and took me and Shafique-ur-Rehman 
(deceased) to the DHQ Hospital, Gujranwala. Except 
myself, no other person witnessed the occurrence. I 
am innocent in this case. PWs are close friends of the 
complainant and they have deposed falsely against me 
with the connivance of the complainant. The PWs 
have also taken the bribe from the complainant for 
deposing against me.” 
After recording the statement under section 342 of Cr.P.C., the accused, 
Shazam, moved the application for summoning of officials of rescue 1122 as 
court witnesses, as they reached the place of occurrence and they were 
important witnesses. On the application of the accused, Shazam Ali, on 
11.03.2019, the learned trial court summoned Mubeen Ahmad, Ijaz, and 
Irfan, members of the rescue 1122 force, as court witnesses for a just 
decision of the case. Ijaz Ahmad, Emergency Medical Technician, appeared 
as CW-2 and deposed during his examination-in-chief, as follows: - 
“Stated that on 30th March, 2017 I was posted at 
Sialkot Bypass as EMT in Rescue-1122 and on the 
same day, after receiving the phone call as to the 
incident in the control room of 1122 Force, I 
alongwith Mubeen EMT and Irfan LTV left our office

10
for Vanilan village Juma Bazar. We reached at the 
place of occurrence at 12:23 p.m. I alongwith Mubeen 
EMT and Irfan LTV saw the two victims at the spot. 
One victim was dead and the other victim Shazam 
was in injured condition. The person namely Shazam 
was in sitting position on the front seat of the car in 
injured condition. The dead victim was lying outside 
the car on the ground. Firstly, I and Mubeen EMT 
examined the dead person and thereafter, we checked 
person namely Shazam. We observed injury on the 
right arm of the dead person and we observed injury 
on the left thigh of person namely Shazam. Due to 
injury on the thigh of the person namely Shazam, he 
was not able to move. On our asking, the person 
namely Shazam stated that quarrel took place 
between him and the dead person lying there and due 
to the said quarrel, they made firing on each other. 
We made phone call to the control room for calling 
the police at the spot. We took the dead person and 
the injured Shazam to DHQ Hospital, Gujranwala. 
We provided first aid to the person namely Shazam. I 
saw that one pistol was lying on the front seat where 
the person namely Shazam was sitting. I authored the 
response forms and I produce the same in the court. 
(This court has perused the response forms and after 
perusal and placing the copy of the said documents on 
the record after comparing them with the original 
and after getting attested the same by Ijaz Ahmad 
CW-2/author who brought the same in the court, the 
original record is returned to the CW). Ex-CW-2/A is 
response form of Shazam whereas Ex-CW-2/B is 
response form of the dead person which are in my 
handwriting and bears my signatures.” 
During cross-examination conducted by the learned ADPP for the State, Ijaz 
Ahmad (CW-2) deposed that,  
“I have not ascertained at the time of receiving the 
call in the control room that who made the phone call. 
I observed many injuries on the body of the 
deceased/dead person lying at the spot. Except the 
accused Shazam no other person informed me about 
the facts of the occurrence of this case. I observed 
only one injury on the left thigh of the accused 
Shazam. Irfan driver observed one pistol lying on the 
seat where the injured Shazam was sitting. I and my 
other companions have not found and observed any 
other pistol at the spot except the above said pistol.”

& Crl. Appeal No.26723-J of 2019 
 
11
Whereas, during cross-examination conducted by the learned defence 
counsel, Ijaz Ahmad (CW-2) deposed as under: - 
“I have not asked the control room about the name of 
the call maker. We reached at the spot within two 
minutes at about 12:23 p.m. we do not observe time 
which was consumed at the spot in our proceedings. --
----- I authored response form while sitting in my own 
vehicle at the spot. I prepared the said form during 
shifting of the deceased and the injured while sitting 
in the vehicle. When we moved from the spot after 
providing the first aid, I started preparation of the 
response form while sitting in the vehicle. ----- I have 
not made phone call to the police; however, the 
driver, in my presence, contacted with the police and 
the control room for information of the incident.” 
Similarly, Mubeen, Emergency Medical Technician (CW-3), deposed during 
his examination in chief as under: - 
“Stated that on 30.03.2017, I was posted at Sialkot 
Bypass as EMT in Rescue-1122 and on the same day, 
after receiving the phone call as to the incident in the 
control room of 1122 force, I alongwith Ijaz and Irfan 
left our office for Vanianwala Village at Juma Bazar 
and when we reached there, I alongwith my 
companions observed that one car was standing there. 
We also saw that one person aged about 40 years, was 
lying on the ground with the direction of his mouth 
towards the ground. We checked him and found him 
expired. Thereafter, we saw that one person/boy was 
sitting in the car. We checked him and observed one 
firearm injury on thigh of the person. The said person 
in injured condition was not in position to move due 
to firearm injury on his thigh. We lifted hi and 
boarded him in our vehicle. We provided first aid to 
him and on our asking, he disclosed his name as 
Shazam. We asked detail of incident from him and he 
told that the dead person was causing sexual 
harassment to him and firstly the dead person made 
fire on him and thereafter he made fire on him. 
Thereafter, we brought the dead person and the 
injured person Shazam in the hospital.” 
During cross-examination conducted by the learned ADPP for the State, 
Mubeen (CW-3) deposed as under: - 

Murder Reference No.82 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.26723-J of 2019 
 
12
“Only the accused Shazam stated before me that his 
quarrel took place with the deceased and no other 
person was present at that time. I observed only one 
injury on left thigh of the accused Shazam and no 
other injury on his body was observed by me. I 
observed the pistol in the hand of the Driver Irfan. 
Except the pistol observed by me in the hand of the 
Driver, who informed that he lifted the same from the 
front seat where the accused Shazam was sitting, no 
other pistol was observed by me at the spot.” 
Whereas, during cross-examination conducted by the learned defence 
counsel, Mubeen (CW-3) deposed as under: - 
“From the spot, driver Irfan informed the police 
through phone call regarding the occurrence. ----- I 
asked the accused Shazam about the reason of the 
incident and he informed me that the deceased started 
sexual harassment to him. I myself asked the accused 
Shazam while sitting on our emergency vehicle 
regarding the reason of incident.” 
Irfan Ali, driver Rescue 1122 (CW-4), deposed during his examination in 
chief that,  
“I informed the control room through wireless and 
made phone call to the police regarding the 
occurrence. Thereafter, the police did not arrive at 
the spot in our presence and keeping in view the 
injured person, we boarded the other dead person in 
the vehicle and took the both to DHQ Hospital, 
Gujranwala.” 
The depositions of the court witnesses summoned on the request of the 
accused revealed that Ijaz Ahmad (CW-2), Mubeen (CW-3), and Irfan Ali 
(CW-4) were informed about the incident by the control room and they 
reached the place of occurrence. Ijaz Ahmad (CW-2) and Mubeen (CW-3)

comparing the same with the original and attested by Ijaz Ahmad (CW-
2)/author, who brought the record to the court, the original documents were 
returned to the CW after retaining its certified copies. The emergency 
response forms (Ex. CW-2/A & Ex. CW-2/B) reveal that Ijaz Ahmad (CW-
2) prepared the said documents about the information provided by the 
accused Shazam and services provided by them on the spot to the accused 
Shazam and took the dead body of Shafique-ur-Rehman (deceased). The 
emergency response forms (Ex. CW-2/A & Ex.CW-2/B) reveal that the 
statement of injured Shazam Ali-the appellant was recorded as under:- 
” سواری 
 کے مطابق نا معلوم وجہ سے جھگڑنے کی وجہ سے ایک
دوسرے کو گولیاں ماری
۔ “
 
Therefore, the presence of Ijaz Ahmad (CW-2), Mubeen (CW-3), and Irfan 
Ali (CW-4) was admitted by the accused, Shazam. Moreover, they were 
extensively cross-examined in all aspects. In fact, during the cross-
examination, they stated the circumstances under which the deceased and 
injured Shazam were taken to the hospital, i.e., DHQ Hospital, Gujranwala. 
Ijaz Ahmad (CW-2) and Mubeen (CW-3)'s deposition, in the Court's 
opinion, has a ring of truth and cannot be discarded, as is urged on behalf of 
the appellant. At this stage, the defence has not tried requisitioning the 
caller’s record to ascertain who made the call. Whether the said call was 
made by Rana Liaqat or someone else? The fact had come before the 
accused during the testimonies of Ijaz Ahmad (CW-2) and Mubeen (CW-3) 
that the informer’s name was not known to them; instead, information was 
with the control room. We have noted that the appellant had not made effort 
for summoning of caller record from the Rescue 1122 force. Therefore, an 
adverse inference is to be drawn within the meaning of Article 129 (g) of 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, that had the record of caller was summoned 
from Rescue 1122 force, then the said report would have been unfavorable 
to the prosecution. 
12. 
 
In the present case, Shahanshah Abdul Rehman (PW-1)-the 
complainant-identified the accused/appellant in the hospital in injured

condition as a person sitting in the car as a passenger driven by Shafique-ur-
Rehman (the deceased). It is also admitted fact that the accused/appellant 
received injuries during the incident, and the defence plea put to the 
prosecution witness, Shahanshah Abdul Rehman (PW-1), during cross-
examination in the shape of suggestions and made in his statement under 
section 342 of Cr.P.C. is against the entries made in the official record, i.e., 
Emergency Response Forms (Ex. CW-2/A & Ex.CW-2/B). The statement of 
accused/appellant-Shazam Ali soon after the incident made before Ijaz 
Ahmad (CW-2) and Mubeen (CW-3), who were not police officers, instead 
they were the members of rescue 1122, and the appellant did not deny their 
presence, is significant in the circumstances of the instant case. According to 
Article 19-A of the Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, the statement of the 
accused made soon after the incident is relevant. Article 19-A of the 
Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 is as follows: - 
19-Relevant of facts of forming part of the same 
transaction: - Facts which, though not in issue, are so 
connected with a fact in issue as to form part of the 
same transaction, are relevant, whether they occurred 
at the same time and place or at different times and 
places. Illustrations 
(a) 
A is accused of the murder of B by beating him. 
Whatever was said or done by A or B or the by-
standers at the beating, or so shortly before or 
after it as to form part of the transaction, is a 
relevant fact. 
Article 19-A of the Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 makes the evidence of 
the above witnesses, i.e., Ijaz Ahmad (CW-2), Mubeen (CW-3), and Irfan 
Ali (CW-4) admissible because they have stated that on their asking accused 
Shazam said that quarrel took place between them and both of them fired at 
each other. In our view, the rationale for making certain statements on fact 
admissible under Article 19-A of the Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 is on 
account of spontaneity and immediacy of such statement or fact in relation 
to the fact in issue. But such a fact or statement must be part of the same 
transaction. In other words, such a statement must have been made 
immediately thereafter. But if there was an interval that was sufficient for 
fabrication, then the statement is not relevant. What transpires from the 

Murder Reference No.82 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.26723-J of 2019 
 
15
evidence in the present case is that Ijaz Ahmad (CW-2) deposed that on his 
asking the person namely Shazam stated that quarrel took place between him 
and a dead person lying there and due to the said quarrel, they made firing 
on each other. So, the receiving of injury by the accused Shazam, receiving 
of injuries by the deceased, assembling of the Ijaz Ahmad (CW-2), Mubeen 
(CW-3), and Irfan Ali (CW-4) at the spot and after providing medical aid 
shifting of accused Shazam in injured condition and dead to the hospital, 
making of the statement by Shazam before the Ijaz Ahmad (CW-2) are parts 
of the same transaction. The unchallenged evidence of these witnesses 
shows that they came to the spot.
The words of accused Shazam recorded 
in Emergency Response Forms (Ex.CW-2/A & Ex.CW-2/B) are almost 
immediately so that there was hardly any time gap sufficient to enable Ijaz 
Ahmad (CW-2) to fabricate any such story, with the collusion of 
Shahanshah Abdul Rehman (PW-1), whereas Emergency Response Forms 
(Ex.CW-2/A & Ex.CW-2/B) were submitted, soon after shifting of injured 
and dead to the hospital, with the office of 1122 Rescue force. Therefore, we 
are of the firm view that this is a fit case where the doctrine of res gestae 
would be attracted and the testimony of Ijaz Ahmad (CW-2), Mubeen (CW-
3), and Irfan Ali (CW-4) being treated as part of the same transaction in 
which the occurrence took place would be relevant and admissible and 
acceptable in aid of the prosecution. The defence failed to shatter the 
testimonies of Ijaz Ahmad (CW-2), Mubeen (CW-3), and Irfan Ali (CW-4). 
During cross-examination, Irfan Ali (CW-4)-the driver, categorically stated 
that for lifting the injured in the vehicle, he provided his help to CW-2 & 
CW-3. The appellant has not offered a satisfactory explanation as to why he 
was accompanying Shafique-ur-Rehman (the deceased) in the car and for 
what reasons he traveled from Lahore to Gujranwala on a fateful day along 
with Shafique-ur-Rehman, the deceased. Explanation in this regard was 
necessary because he (the appellant) admitted his presence in the car and 
received injuries while sitting in the car. The defence takes the specific 
defence, and the onus lies on the defence to prove it, but the defence failed 
to adduce an iota of evidence. The prosecution evidence in the shape of 
testimonies of Shahanshah Abdul Rehman (PW-1)-the complainant, and 

Murder Reference No.82 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.26723-J of 2019 
 
16
court witnesses, i.e., Ijaz Ahmad (CW-2), Mubeen (CW-3), and Irfan Ali 
(CW-4), established the guilt of the accused/appellant-Shazam Ali.  
13. 
 
The medical evidence was furnished by Dr. Hassan Ihsan (PW-
9), who observed six firearm injuries, one incised wound, and two abrasions 
on the dead body of Shafique-ur-Rehman (the deceased). From the 
testimony of Dr. Hassan Ihsan (PW-9) and perusal of the postmortem report 
(Ex. PH), it reveals that Shafique-ur-Rehman, received injuries from a very 
close range and the position shown in the scaled site plan and un-scaled site 
plan (Ex. PF & Ex.CW-1/E) reveals that Shafique-ur-Rehman was sitting at 
driver side, which was on right side of the accused/appellant-Shazam Ali, 
who was sitting on the front seat at the left side of the driver, i.e., Shafique-
ur-Rehman. Shafique-ur-Rehman received firearm injuries on the inner side 
of his right leg, and their exit was on the outer side of his right leg. This 
indicates that during the grappling, the deceased and injured Shazam 
received injuries. It all indicates that the contents of the Emergency 
Response Form (Ex. CW-2/A & Ex. CW-2/B) are correct, as per the 
statement made by the accused/appellant-Shazam Ali.  
14. 
 
In the cases where the ocular account is not available and 
circumstantial evidence is produced, it is not mathematically expected in the 
deposition of the witness’s every explanation. There may be some ups and 
downs about the information of time and the facts, but the fact remains that 
the evidence to the extent of the significant event should apply to the prudent 
mind. It is settled law that the court has to see the quality of the evidence and 
not the quantity of the same. Similarly, when the witnesses of the 
prosecution are examined in court after a long gap, minor discrepancies, 
contradictions, and omissions are open in the testimonies of the witnesses. 
Hardly one comes across a witness whose evidence does not contain a grain 
of untruth or embellishments. Merely because the testimony of Malik 
Muhammad Raza (PW-2) and Muhammad Imtiaz (PW-3) cannot rely upon, 
it is not necessary to follow as a matter of law that must be discarded in all 
other respects. We have noted that the injured Shazam Ali has not produced 
his medico-legal certificate in his defence, nor Dr. Hassan Ihsan (PW-9), 

Murder Reference No.82 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.26723-J of 2019 
 
17
while appearing in the court, deposed in this regard in his examination-in-
chief. However, during cross-examination, he (PW-9) admitted that he 
medically examined Shazam Ali-injured (the appellant) on the same day.  
15. 
 
Given the above circumstances, we have concluded that the 
prosecution has proven its case against the appellant beyond any shadow of 
doubt. We have observed the factor which has persuaded us not to uphold 
the capital sentence of the appellant. There are discrepancies regarding the 
recovery of pistol 30-bore (P-1) in respect of the commission of the offence. 
In the instant case, the evidence produced by the prosecution about securing 
the pistol 30-bore (P-1) and taking it into possession vide recovery memo 
(Ex. PD) is concerned same is not trustworthy, given the deposition of Irfan 
Ali (CW-4), which was also affirmed by Ijaz Ahmad (CW-2) and Mubeen 
(CW-3). Irfan Ali (CW-4) specifically said in his examination-in-chief that:  
“Injured person was having one pistol, which was 
lying on the seat on which he was sitting. I lifted the 
said pistol, and on our arrival in the DHQ, I handed 
over the said pistol to the police.”  
During cross-examination conducted by the learned ADPP for the State, 
Irfan Ali (CW-4) deposed as under: - 
“At the time of help and lifting the injured Shazam, I 
observed and found one pistol lying at the place of 
feet of the driving seat where the accused Shazam was 
sitting. Only one pistol was found from inside the car 
and no other pistol was found. No pistol was found at 
the place where the dead person was lying.” 
Whereas, during cross-examination conducted by the learned defence 
counsel, Irfan Ali (CW-4) deposed as under: - 
“I handed over the pistol to the police in the DHQ 
Hospital, Gujranwala and I cannot state the rank or 
the name of the said police officer to whom I handed 
over the pistol…..  I locked the car standing at the 
spot and handed-over the key of the said vehicle to the 
police in DHQ Hospital, Gujranwala as the police did 
not arrive at the spot in our presence.”

& Crl. Appeal No.26723-J of 2019 
 
18
Whereas Manzar Saeed S.I. (CW-1)-the investigating officer, deposed 
during cross-examination as under:  
“Incharge Crime Scene Unit of the office of PFSA 
collected one crime empty (P-5) from the place of 
occurrence and handed over the same to me which I 
took into possession vide recovery memo Ex-PE, 
which was attested by Malik Muhammad Raza and 
Imtiaz Ahmad PWs.-----------I collected one pistol (P-
1) from inside the car, parceled it and took the same 
into possession vide recovery memo Ex-PD, which 
was attested by Malik Muhammad Raza and Imtiaz 
Ahmad PWs.” 
The mode of recovery of one pistol (P-1) and crime empty (P-5) from inside 
the car creates doubt. So, to the extent of the pistol and the crime empty 
recovered from the place of occurrence by Manzar Saeed S.I. (CW-1)-the 
investigating officer, a favorable report of PFSA is of no consequence.  
16. 
 
Given the above circumstances, we have concluded that the 
prosecution has proven its case against the appellant-Shazam Ali, beyond 
any shadow of a doubt. However, the factors which have persuaded us not to 
uphold the capital sentence of the appellant are the mode and manner of 
recovery of the pistol 30-bore (P-1) and crime empty (P-5), which we have 
already disbelieved. As the appellant has been convicted and sentenced to 
death for the murder of Shafique-ur-Rehman, the deceased, in such an 
eventuality, the same can be considered a mitigating circumstance. Based on 
the grounds discussed hereinabove, we believe that mitigating circumstances 
exist about the quantum of the appellant’s sentence. Therefore, in our view 
death sentence awarded to the appellant is quite harsh. The well-recognized 
principle is that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt as an 
extenuating circumstance while deciding his question sentence. The Hon’ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan holds it in the case titled “Dilawar Hussain v. 
The State” (2013 SCMR 1582) in which the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan has observed on page 1590 as under: - 
“---It has neither been the mandate of law nor the 
dictates of this court as to what quantum of mitigation 
is required for awarding imprisonment for life rather 

Murder Reference No.82 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.26723-J of 2019 
 
19
even an iota towards the mitigation is sufficient to 
justify the lesser sentence. According to our 
estimation, even a single stance providing mitigation 
or extenuating circumstance would be sufficient to 
award lesser punishment as an abundant caution. In 
such circumstances, if the court is satisfied that there 
are certain reasons due to which the death sentence is 
not warranted, the court has no other option but to 
improve second sentence of imprisonment for life 
while 
extending 
benefit 
of 
the 
extenuating 
circumstances to the convict in a just and fair 
manner---.” 
 
17. 
 
In these circumstances, the appeal bearing No.26723-J of 2019, 
filed by the appellant, Shazam Ali, son of Asghar Ali, in the private 
complaint filed under sections 302, 392 PPC P.S. Aroop, District 
Gujranwala titled “Shahanshah Abdul Rehman Vs. Shazam Ali, etc.”, filed 
in case FIR No.241/2017, under section 302/392 P.P.C, Police Station 
Aroop, District Gujranwala is dismissed. However, his (the appellant’s) 
death sentence is converted into imprisonment for life. The benefit of 
Section 382(b) of Cr.P.C is also extended to the appellant. The 
compensation amount and sentence qua non-payment of the compensation 
amount imposed by the learned trial court shall remain intact upon the 
appellant (convict).  
18. 
 
Murder Reference No.82 of 2019, forwarded by the learned 
trial court for confirmation of the sentence of death inflicted upon the 
convicts fails, which is answered in Negative.
