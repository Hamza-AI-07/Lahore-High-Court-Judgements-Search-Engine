same are hereby reproduced as under: - 
“JUDGMENT 
30.07.2016 
  
Brief facts of the case as per private complaint are that on intervening 
night of 23/24.10.2012, at about 11 PM, in the area of Chak No. 155 J.B, Tehsil 
Bhowana, P.s. Langrana, when complainant alongwith her sons Talib Hussain, 
Zahoor and Bakht Bibi w/o Saddique, was sleeping at the Dhari of one 
Saddique, accused persons while armed with firearms came on three cars and 
made hostage the complainant, Zahoor, Saddique and Bakht Bibi on gun point 
while accused Khuda Yar and Nawazish raised the "lalkara" that let the Talib 
Hussain not alive. That accused Nawazish gave a butt blow of gun, which hit on 
the left abdomen of Talib Hussain, second blow was given by accused Afzaal 
which hit on the right abdomen of Afzaal. Accused Khuda Yar gave a sota blow 
which hit on the left wrist of Talib Hussain while remaining accused also beaten 
him with the butt of the gun and sotas, as a result of which he sustained injuries 
on his person. That accused Afzaal raised "lalkara" that Talib Hussain is still 
alive, on which accused Muhammad Khan made straight fire of pistol, which hit 
on his left shoulder while remaining accused also made firing and went away. 
That motive behind the occurrence is that earlier a case FIR No.262/12 was got 
registered by accused Khuda Yar against Talib Hussain etc at P.S 
Tandlianwala, regarding the abduction and "Zina" of Sajida Bibi, which was 
cancelled in the light of her statement. That Sajida Bibi also filed suit for 
dissolution of marriage against her husband at Family Court Tandlianwala 
while accused had suspicion that it was got filed by Talib Hussain. That on 
22.10.2012 when complainant alongwith his son Zahoor was home at his home, 

Criminal Revision No.25587 of 2017

accused Nausheer and Hakim came with Muhammad Aslam and admitted their 
guilt, whereupon complainant filed another application for nomination of said 
accused but local police, being collusive with the accused, declared them 
innocent. Hence, this private complaint. 
2.  
After institution of this private complaint accused persons were 
summoned by learned predecessor vide order dated, 03.03.2014. thereafter on 
14.10.2016 formal charge against accused namely Muhammad Khan, Haq 
Nawaz, 
Nausheer 
and 
Khuda 
Yar 
were 
framed 
u/s 
324/337L2/F5/337D/148/149-PPC, to which they pleaded not guilty and 
claimed to be tried whereas the remaining accused were declared proclaimed 
offender due to their non-appearance in the court. 
3.  
Whereupon complainant was directed to produce her evidence. 
Complainant Nooran Bibi herself appeared in the witness box as PW-1, she 
produced Talib Hussain, the alleged injured as PW-2, Muhammad Aslam as 
PW-3. Tallat Abbas 95/MHC appeared as CW-1, Mohsin Raza 841/C Cw-2, 
Ilyas ASI/I.O as CW-3, Dr. Rehmat Ullah S.M.O THQ Hospital Bhowana as 
CW-4, Khadim Hussain 237/C CW-5 and learned ADPP closed his evidence. 
4.  
Thereafter statements of the accused u/s 342 Cr.PC was recorded, 
whereby they denied the happening of the occurrence and agitated that this case 
was got registered against them due to support of accused Khuda Yar in 
returning of hand of Sajida Bibi, the abductee. Accused persons showed their 
ignorance about MLC and asserted that PWs are inter se 
related, hence they 
deposed falsely against them, being collusive with the complainant. 
5.  
Accused did not opt to get record their statements under 340(2) Cr.PC, 
as well as to produce their defense evidence.”

by firearm weapon while probable duration of injury was within last 6 hours. 
EX.CW-F is carbon copy of his medico legal report while EX.CWF/1 is sketch 
of injuries. 
On 25.10.2012, he issued a corrigendum to SHO P/S Langrana, 
regarding this injured, vide letter No. 405. As the patient was in critical 
condition due to firearm injury in chest with profuse bleeding and dyspnoea. 
Following blunt injuries were missed un-intentionally in MLC No. 1265/12. So, 
these injuries should be considered as part of MLC No. 1265/12. This

Declaration of Kuo injuries. 
Keeping in view the X-ray, report Ultrasonography reports and 
operation notes of Allied Hospital Faisalabad injuries were declared as under:

300 ml, blood was drained and chest tube was passed. Keeping in view this

injury related to spinal cord caused by injury No.1 was reserved till discharge

EX.CWH. 
10.  
Perusal of record transpires that instant FIR was registered against ten 
nominated accused persons, namely Muhammad Khan, Afzaal, Khuda Yar, Haq 

Criminal Revision No.25587 of 2017 
5
Nawaz, Akram, Kazim, Nawazish, Noor, Akhtar and Shamaan whereas two 
accused namely Hakim Ali and Nausheer were nominated by the complainant 
through her supplementary statement on 04.11.2012. Record further depicts 
that out of total twelve accused six accused persons namely Akram, Kazim and 
Nawazish were declared innocent by the police with observation that they were 
found not present at the spot. Likewise, about two other accused Khuda Yar and 
Nausheer Noor I.O also opined that they were not present at the place of 
occurrence while about accused Muhammad Khan I.O observed that he was not 
armed with any weapon and he did not injure the Talib Hussain. 
11.  
Being dissatisfied with the investigation of the police complainant filed 
instant private complaint EX.PB, against all the accused persons who were 
summoned after recording cursory statement of the complainant and her 
witnesses but except accused Nausheer, Muhammad Khan, Khuda Yar and Haq 
Nawaz, accused persons did not appear to face the trial and ultimately they 
were declared proclaimed offender. However, the aforesaid accused persons 
appeared in the court  and face the trial. Record signifies  that no specific and 
distinctive role has been attributed to the accused Haq Nawaz and Nausheer in 
the application EX.PA and complaint EX.PB and even during the evidence of 
complainant and injured as PW-1 & PW-2 respectively. Further, no alleged 
weapon of offence was recovered from the possession of the accused Nausheer 
during the investigation whereas a sota has been shown to be recovered from 
the possession of accused Haq Nawaz but it has not been alleged by the 
complainant that he actively participated in the occurrence or he did any overt 
act during the occurrence. Accused Khuda Yar is though nominated in the FIR 
with specific role of causing injury on the left wrist of the injured Talib Hussain 
but surprisingly complainant while appearing in the witness box as PW-1 stated 
that he caused injury on the right forearm of the injured Talib Hussain while 
said Talib Hussain as PW-2 stated that he caused injury on his left forearm. In 
the circumstances, it is obvious that there is material contradiction between the 
statements of the complainant as PW-1 and injured Talib Hussain  as PW-2 as 
to causing of injury by accused Khuda Yar. 
 
12.  
 It is also pertinent to mention here that on 24.10.2012, police prepared 
the injury statement of the injured Talib Hussain EX.CWE, whereby only one 
injury of firearm was noted on his person and accordingly M.O issued MLC 
EX.CWF, showing one injury of lacerated wound on front of left upper chest, 
with corresponding exit wound but astonishingly on the very next day he issued a 
corrigendum EX.CWG, observing that three other injuries were also found on the 
person of the injured and as per statement of the M.O same could not be 
mentioned on the first MLC due to critical condition of the injured. This fact 
casts serious doubts as to veracity of remaining injuries No. 2 to 4 of the injured 
and suggests that these injuries are after thoughts and manipulated. 
 
13.  
Keeping in view the aforementioned facts and circumstances, case of the 
prosecution to the extent of accused Nausheer, Haq Nawaz and Khuda Yar is 
highly doubtful and it is settled law that benefit of doubt, how slightest it may be, 
is always given to the accused. Therefore, by extending benefit of doubt accused 
Nausheer, Khuda Yar and Haq Nawaz are hereby acquitted from the instant 
case. Their sureties stand discharged from liability. 
 
14.  
So far as, role of accused Muhammad Khan is concerned, as per version 
of the complainant he caused injury with the fire shot of pistol on the person of 
injured Talib Hussain on the left side of his chest near shoulder. Complainant 
and injured Talib Hussain are also in line about the role of the accused 
Muhammad Khan. They categorically stated that he made fire shot of pistol, 
which hit on left side of the injured Talib Hussain on chest near heart and left 
shoulder. Injury statement EX.CWE and MLC EX.CWF of the injured also fully 
corroborate the stance of the complainant to the extent of this injury. Rehmat 
Ullah M.O as CW-4 clearly stated that he found lacerated wound of 1.1CM X 
ICM, with inverted margins on front of left upper chest, with corresponding exit 
wound of 2.5CM and 2CM on back of right middle chest of the injured. He 
further stated that after the examination due to critical condition patient was 
referred to Allied Hospital Faisalabad for expert management. He also 

Criminal Revision No.25587 of 2017 
6
observed that injury was inflicted by firearm weapons, which was later on 
declared as u/s 337D-PPC (jurh Jaifa), keeping in view X-ray reports, 
ultrasonography report and operation notes of Allied Hospital Faisalabad. The 
said fire arm injury is on vital part of the injured Talib Hussain which 
establishes that accused Muhammad Khan made fire shot with the intention to 
cause death of the injured Talib Hussain and attempted to commit his murder. 
Counsel for the accused argued that during investigation no alleged weapon of 
offence was recovered from the possession of accused Muhammad Khan and it 
was also found that he did not make any fire shot on the person of the injured 
Talib Hussain. Needless to say that opinion of the police is not binding upon the 
court, particularly when the ocular account i.e. statement of the injured and eye 
witnesses and medical evidence are supporting each other and secondly the 
recovery of weapon of offence is just a corroborative piece of evidence and 
cannot be treated as substantial evidence. Ocular testimony of the complainant, 
being eye witness and statement of the injured are trust worthy and in-
consonance with medical account. 
15.  
In these circumstances, I am of the view that complainant has 
successfully proved her case to the extent of accused Muhammad Khan, s/o 
Naseer, therefore he is convicted of offence u/s 324-PPC and is sentenced to 
simple imprisonment of five years and he shall also be liable to pay fine of Rs. 
20,000/- and in case of non-payment of fine he shall further undergo simple 
imprisonment for the period of fifteen days. The injury caused by the accused 
Muhammad Khan has been declared as 337-D-PPC, therefore he is also 
convicted of the offence u/s 337-D PPC. Record depicts that he is previous non 
convict, non record holder, thus keeping in view the spirit of section 337N2-
PPC, he shall be liable to pay 1/3 arsh of the diyat, to the injured Talib 
Hussain, according to notification for the year 2012 & 2013, which is Rs. 
844,024/-, which will be paid in lump sum and convict shall also remain in jail 
till the payment of amount of Arsh. The benefit u/s 382B Cr.PC is also extended 
in favour of convict. The sentence shall run concurrently with the other 
sentences, if any. The convict Muhammad Khan s/o Naseer is on bail, he is 
taken into custody. Warrant of sentence be issued in the name of Superintendent 
District Jail Jhang. Copy of this judgment is delivered to the convict 
Muhammad Khan free of cost. Case property, if any, be dealt in accordance 
with law.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    (emphasis added) 
Being aggrieved, petitioner challenged aforementioned convictions and 
sentences through appeal before learned Sessions Judge, Chiniot whereas Mst. 
Nooran Bibi (complainant of the case) preferred revision petition seeking 
enhancement of the sentences awarded to the petitioner; appeal filed by the 
petitioner was partly allowed whereas revision petition filed by complainant of 
the case was dismissed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Chiniot vide 
impugned judgment dated: 14.03.2017; relevant portion of the same in this 
regard is hereby reproduced as follows:-  
“12.  After hearing the learned counsel for the appellant, learned counsel for 
the complainant and ADPP for the state and having gone through the record of 
the case with their able assistance, it has been observed that learned trial court 
observed certain material contradictions in the statements of complainant and 
injured/Pw.1. Talib Hussain, regarding injuries caused by others co-accused 
persons. So far as role of present appellant Muhammad Khan is concerned, 
the single fire-shot injury mentioned in injury statement Ex.CWE and MLC, 
Ex.CW.F, issued by Medical Officer is attributed to him. The seat of injury is 

Criminal Revision No.25587 of 2017 
7
near to his left shoulder on upper side of chest. Injured Talib Hussain 
categorically stated that Muhammad Khan made this fire-shot. Complainant 
as Pw.I attempted to state in line with crime report, but injured Talib Husain 
did not name his mother Noran Bibi complainant as present at the time of 
occurrence, or eye witness, during his examination in chief. So, the presence of 
complainant at the time of occurrence stands doubtful. No other independent 
/private/eye witness has been produced by prosecution out of Zahoor, Bakhat 
Bibi or Siddique, named by injured during his evidence. 
 
13.  
Now coming to nature of injury as 337-C – “Jalfah is defined as injury 
extending to the body cavity of trunk". Cavity fairły means hollowness. The seat 
of Injury would be on chest cavity or thoracic cavity which is the cavity in the 
vertebrate body enclosed by the ribs between the diaphragm and the neck 
containing the lungs and heat, i.e., vital organs, but in the case in hand, neither 
the fire-shot injury damaged any of these vital organs, nor the ribs. Medical 
Officer who examined the injured on 24.10.2012 did not found this injury 
attracting 337-D or extending to the body cavity of trunk. In the situation supra 
and in absence of any other medical evidence on record to establish the fire-
shot injury effecting the body cavity, and not the muscles and flesh only, the 
attraction of 337-D is not safe. This situation is coupled with the prima-facie 
non-framing of charge under this section, rather later addition of 337-D with 
pen without initial signatures of the learned trial Magistrate. Therefore, neither 
the framing of charge u/s 337-D, nor the attraction of this offence is made out, 
therefore, conviction on this score is set-aside. 
 
14.  
Although complainant party has denied the presence of Sajida Bibi with 
injured Talib Hussain at the time of occurrence but they have alleged the doubt 
of abduction of Sajida Bibi qua the injured Talib Hussain, as "motive of the 
occurrence". Perusal of record suggestions of defence counsels during evidence 
of Pws and Cw.3. Muhammad Ilyas show that Sajida Bibi was statedly abducted 
by Talib Hussain on 2.7.2012 who came back on 8.7.2012, later to that her 
father got registered FIR No.262/2012 in P.S Sadar Tandiawala district, 
Faisalabad against Talib etc in this regard. Thereafter to get the favourable 
statement of Sajida Bibi in his favour, statedly Talib Hussain re-abducted her, 
and at the time of occurrence in hand, she was with Talib and was taken back 
by her family and accused party. At present Sajida Bibi has died. Injured Talib 
Hussain and 3 others have been exonerated by the learned trial court, by 
observing that Sajida Bibi/victim vide her statement u/s 164 Cr.P.C dated 
25.9.2012 exonerated the accused persons from commission of crime. This date 
of her statement u/s 164 Cr.P.C, i.e. 25.9.2012, falls in between her earlier 
abduction on 2.7.2012 and return on 8.7.2012, and the later occurrence in hand 
dated 23/24.10.2012. 
 
15.  
Adverting to the supra facts, evidence of injured Talib Husain and seat 
of injury caused by fire shot of Muhammad Khan, commission of offence u/s 
324 PPC stands proved and he has been rightly convicted by learned trial 
court u/s 324 PPC. However. considering the earlier episode and invitation of 
luckless event by the injured himself, without any direct enmity of 
Muhammad Khan with the injured Talib Hussain, Muhammad Khan 
appellant who is confined in jail, his sentence is reduced to simple 
imprisonment of 2 years and he shall also be liable to pay fine of Rs.20,000/- 
and in case of non-payment of fine he should further under go simple 
imprisonment for the period of fifteen days. 
 
16.  
As far as injury caused by fire-shot of Muhammad Khan is concerned, 
the same is an entry and exit wound as per record exposure of without 
fracture of bone. So, the same is attracting section 337F3 PPC, and the basic 
punishment provided for section 337F3 PPC being Daman, whereas the 
punishment of imprisonment as discretionary, in this case of single fire-arm 
injury, in the absence of any previous record of accused, he is convicted u/s 
337F3 PPC and sentenced to pay Rs.20,000/- as Daman. In case of default in 
payment be kept in jail till the payment of amount of Daman.

17. 
Although the complainant has requested to enhance the sentence of the 
accused, but in the light of supra detailed discussion, the assertion of 
complainant regarding enhancement of sentence is not convincing. 
18.  
The upshot of above discussion is that criminal appeal is partly allowed 
in the above narrated terms, whereas revision petition filed by Nooran Bibi, 
complainant is dismissed.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis added) 
 
3.  
Feeling aggrieved, petitioner has filed instant criminal revision petition 
before this Court wherein notice was issued to the State and respondent No. 2/ 
complainant.  
4.   
Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that both the impugned 
judgments (mentioned above) are against the law as well as facts of the case; adds 
that prosecution remained unable to prove its case beyond shadow of reasonable 
doubt; finally prays for setting-aside the impugned judgments and clean acquittal of 
the petitioner from this case.  
5. 
Conversely, learned Deputy Prosecutor General assisted by learned 
counsel for the complainant has submitted that prosecution has proved its case 
against the petitioner up to hilt while producing confidence inspiring evidence; 
finally prayed for dismissal of this revision petition.  
 
6.  
Arguments heard and available record perused. 
 
7.  
By now it is well settled that while exercising powers under revisional 
jurisdiction, this Court has to only look legality, correctness, regularity and 
propriety of the proceedings of the Courts below rather than to have a full-
fledged reappraisal of evidence and in this regard, guidance has been sought 
from the case of “KHADIJA SIDDIQUI and another versus SHAH 
HUSSAIN and another” (PLD 2019 Supreme Court 261); relevant portion 
from its paragraph No.18 is hereby reproduced: - 
“Apart from that the High Court ought to have appreciated 
that it was only seized of revision petitions and not an appeal and in 
exercise of its revisional jurisdiction the High Court ought to have 
confined itself to correctness, legality, regularity or propriety of the 
proceedings of the courts below rather than embarking upon a full-
fledged reappraisal of the evidence, an exercise fit for appellate 
jurisdiction.” 
 

Criminal Revision No.25587 of 2017

It goes without saying that while appreciating evidence particularly ocular 
account in a “murder” case, it is kept in mind that recipient of the injuries has 
died and not in the witness box to tell that who has caused injuries to him; 
therefore, circumstances including natural or as per chance presence of 
eyewitnesses at the place of occurrence, possibility of their seeing the 
occurrence with exactness, telling the occurrence with accuracy and other 
factors including their own grudges, if any, regarding involvement of the 
accused in the case, chances of exaggerations, false implication and 
corroboration of their testimony alongwith other relevant facts have to be seen 
whereas in the “hurt” case, recipient of the injury i.e. victim having stamp of 
injury on his body, appears before the Court, his presence at the place during 
the occurrence usually cannot be denied, he tells about the person(s) who 
caused injury to him; though intrinsic value of his testimony is to be tested on 
the touchstone of principle of appreciation of evidence yet minor discrepancy 
due to passage of time is to be overlooked and when credit of his testimony has 
not been impeached rather same appeared as truthful, cogent, convincing and 
reliable as well as confirmed by the medical evidence, then it establishes the 
allegation.    
  
It is relevant to mention here that in this case, prosecution witnesses were 
subjected to searching cross-examination but anything favourable to present 
petitioner could not come on the record rather they remained coherent, consistent 
and credibility of their testimony could not be minimized/impeached to the extent 
of present petitioner; any material could not be brought on record to establish that 
prosecution witnesses were having any reason to falsely involve the petitioner in 
the case; even otherwise, presence of Talib Hussain (injured witness/PW-2) who 
was having stamp of receiving firearm injuries on his body at the “time and place” 
of occurrence, is beyond doubt and his testimony carries more evidentiary value; 
in this regard, guidance has been sought from cases of “ALLAH DAD and others 
versus MUHAMMAD NAWAZ  and others” (2001 SCMR 1111), “MUHAMMAD 
SADIQ versus THE STATE” (2003 SCMR 736) and “AQIL versus The STATE” 

Criminal Revision No.25587 of 2017

(2023 SCMR 831). Therefore, ocular account produced by the prosecution to the 
extent of present petitioner is confidence inspiring, truthful and reliable.  
  
It is also relevant to see that occurrence in this case took place in the year 
2012 and statements of witnesses of ocular account i.e. Mst. Nooran Bibi 
(complainant/PW-1) and Talib Hussain (injured of the case/PW-2) were recorded 
in the year 2016. Minor inconsistencies and discrepancies do appear in the 
statements of witnesses with the passage of time; however, such inconsistencies/ 
discrepancies cannot dislodge the case of prosecution; in this regard, case of 
“SAJID MEHMOOD versus The STATE” (2022 S C M R 1882) and 
“MUHAMMAD BASHIR and another versus The STATE and others”                  
(2023 S C M R 190) can be safely referred. 
As per ocular version, Muhammad Khan (petitioner) caused firearm 
injury at right side of shoulder of Talib Hussain (injured/PW-2); Dr. Rehmat 
Ullah (CW-4) conducted medical examination of said injured, issued MLC 
(Ex.CW-F) and observed the wound of 1.1cm x 1 cm with inverted margins on 
front of left upper chest with corresponding exit wound of 2.5cm and 2 cm on 
back of right middle chest; so, medical evidence comprising of Medicolegal 
Examination Certificate (Ex.CW-F) of Talib Hussain (injured/PW-2) and 
statement of Dr. Rehmat Ullah (CW-4), has confirmed/supported afore-mentioned 
ocular version.  
  
So far as attempt of the Investigating officer to extend concession to 
the petitioner during his statement before trial court that though petitioner 
participated in the occurrence yet he was not having firearm weapon with 
him is concerned, suffice it to say that same is without any substance, mere 
ipse dixit and not based upon any supportive, cogent material/evidence;  
even any witness was not produced during trial of the case in support of said 
opinion of the Investigating Officer. It is trite law that concession          
extended by Investigating Officer without production of witnesses in  
support of the same is inadmissible in evidence; in this regard, guidance has 
been sought from the case of “MUHAMMAD IQBAL and others versus 

Criminal Revision No.25587 of 2017 
11
MUHAMMAD AKRAM and another” (1996 SCMR 908) wherein it has 
been held as under: - 
“The reasons given by the High Court for giving benefit of doubt to 
the accused are artificial and imaginary. The opinion of the Police  
about the innocence of Muhammad Akram or with regard to alibi 
pleaded by him before the Police during the investigation, which 
according to the Investigating Officer was supported by a number of 
witnesses, lack evidentiary value. The accused has not produced the 
witnesses in the Court in proof of his alibi. Needless to say that 
opinion of the Police about the guilt or innocence based on statement 
of witnesses not produced before the Court is inadmissible in 
evidence.”  
 
As far as non-recovery of weapon of offence from the petitioner is 
concerned, suffice it to say that recovery is mere corroboratory piece of evidence 
and when ocular account is otherwise confidence inspiring, then mere non-
recovery is not necessary for conviction. Even otherwise, non-recovery of 
weapon from the petitioner by the Investigating Officer is quite understandable 
because he (Investigating Officer) was toeing the line of his opinion that 
petitioner was not equipped with firearm weapon.  
So far as acquittal of co-accused persons namely Nausher, Khuda Yar and 
Haq Nawaz vide impugned judgment dated: 30.07.2016 passed by learned 
Judicial Magistrate Section: 30, Bhowana/trial court is concerned, suffice it to say 
that Nausher was not nominated in the application (Ex.PA) for registration of 
case; as per said application (Ex.PA), Khuda Yar and Haq Nawaz did not cause 
any firearm injury to anyone in the occurrence rather Khuda Yar with co-accused 
raised lalkara and then he gave blow with stick which hit on the wrist of left hand 
of Talib Hussain (injured) whereas Haq Nawaz along with other co-accused 
persons was alleged with collective role of causing injuries to Talib Hussain but in 
the Injury Statement (Ex.CWE) of Talib Hussain as well as in the medico-legal 
examination certificate (Ex.CWF) issued by Dr. Rehmat Ullah (CW-4), only one 
firearm entry and one firearm exit wound were mentioned; however, on the next 
day, he issued a corrigendum (Ex.CWG) while observing that three other injuries 
were also found on the person of the injured but the trial court did not give any 
weight to this aspect i.e. corrigendum and due to said collective reasons                 

Criminal Revision No.25587 of 2017

while extending benefit of doubt, Nausher, Haq Nawaz and Khuda Yar (co-
accused persons, mentioned above) were acquitted in the case; in this regard, 
paragraphs No.12 and 13 of the impugned judgment dated: 30.07.2016 passed 
by trial court are relevant/self-explanatory (which have already been 
reproduced above); even otherwise, when in such circumstances, said co-
accused persons have been acquitted as an abundant caution, then their 
acquittal cannot have any adverse effect on the prosecution’s case regarding 
the remaining accused i.e. present petitioner; in this regard, case of 
“SHAHEEN IJAZ alias BABU versus The STATE” (2021 SCMR 500) can 
be safely referred wherein it has been held as under: - 
“Petitioner’s sole nomination as being the one to have targeted the 
deceased with five entrance wounds is a circumstance that reflects 
positively on complainant’s conduct; nomination of co-accused with 
inconsequential roles notwithstanding, their presence at the scene 
followed by acquittal, seemingly out of abundant caution, does not 
tremor prosecution’s mainstay qua the role assigned to the petitioner. 
In the totality of circumstances, presence of petitioner’s sons in an 
incident, coming about next door, would not by itself bring them into 
the community of intention and as such their acquittal cannot be 
viewed as a circumstance casting away the entire case.” 
 
Now coming to the defence version, petitioner neither produced any 
evidence in his defence nor himself appeared on oath under Section: 340 (2) 
Cr.P.C. for dislodging of allegation levelled against him; therefore, defence 
version is liable to be discarded. Now when Court has kept aforementioned 
prosecution version, which is based upon statements of eyewitnesses including 
injured/witness, who have faced acid test of cross-examination and supported 
by medical evidence in the case, in juxtaposition with defence version, which 
comprises upon only concession extended by the Investigating Officer and bald 
claim of appellant contained in his statement recorded under Section 342 
Cr.P.C, then it has been observed that defence version stands nowhere and 
same has neither been proved nor found as probable/possible whereas 
prosecution version has been found as straightforward, plausible and reliable to 
the extent of present petitioner; therefore, prosecution has proved its case 
against the petitioner upto hilt, beyond any shadow of doubt.

Nutshell of the above discussion is that in peculiar facts and 
circumstances of the case, there is no illegality in the convictions recorded and 
sentences awarded to the petitioner rather same are perfectly valid and quite in 
accordance with settled principles of law on the subject as well as facts of the 
case, therefore, same need no interference. It again goes without saying that 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “FAROOQ HUSSAIN and others versus 
SHEIKH AFTAB AHMAD and others” (PLD 2020 Supreme Court 617) has clearly 
observed that if the Court having examined the decision challenged before it, is 
satisfied with its reasoning and conclusions and is of the view that it does not 
call for any interference, then Court can simply endorse the impugned decision 
and adopt the reasoning of the Court below; relevant portion of said order is 
hereby reproduced below: - 
“It is emphasized that if this Court, having examined the judgment challenged before 
it, is satisfied with its reasoning and conclusions and is of the view that it does not 
call for any interference, this Court can simply endorse the impugned judgment and 
adopt the reasoning of the court below. In such a case, re-tracing the same path 
travelled by the court below appears to be an unnecessary exercise and a waste of 
public time-time which can be allocated to other cases where the decisions of the 
courts below have been overturned or modified. Finding no reversible error in the 
judgment, a concise, simple order can suffice. On the other hand, if the Court is to 
reverse or modify the judgment of the court below, the reasons for the reversal or 
modification must be set forth. 
3.  
This approach adopted by the court, is by no means a short-cut which is 
offensive to fair trial under Article 10-A of the Constitution nor does it in any manner 
undermine due process and fair-play. It is simply a creative way forward that spares 
the Court from writing opinions where a mere adoption of a well-reasoned 
judgement of the court below through a short order serves the purpose adequately.” 
 
 
8.  
In view of what has been discussed above, instant criminal revision 
petition is without substance and is hereby dismissed. Order dated: 21.06.2017 
passed by this Court in Crl. Misc. No.01/2017 with respect to suspension of 
execution of sentence of the petitioner is hereby recalled. Office is directed to 
transmit copy of this judgment to the trial court for execution of remaining 
sentence of the petitioner in accordance with law.
