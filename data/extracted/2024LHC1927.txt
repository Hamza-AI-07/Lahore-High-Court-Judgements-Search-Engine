ABID HUSSAIN CHATTHA, J. This Civil Revision assails the concurrent 
Judgments & Decrees dated 23.10.2017 and 04.02.2019 passed by Civil 
Judge and Additional District Judge, Lahore, respectively, whereby, the suit 
for specific performance of Respondent No. 1 (the “Respondent”) against 
Mst. Abida Rafique Ghouri impleaded through her legal heir (the 
“Petitioner”) was concurrently decreed.  
2. 
Brief facts of this case are that the Respondent instituted a suit for 
specific performance based upon written agreement to sell dated 05.02.2014 
(the “Agreement”) against the Petitioner for purchase of triple storey house 
bearing No. 167/M, measuring 13.5 Marlas situated at Gulberg-III, Lahore 
(the “suit property”). It was alleged that out of total sale consideration of 
Rs. 12-Million, the Respondent paid Rs. 05-Million as earnest money and 
the remaining sale consideration of Rs. 07-Million was payable at the time 
of execution of sale deed or transfer of the suit property with target date of 
05.05.2014. It was also asserted that the Petitioner provided a copy of 
transfer letter in her favour regarding the suit property issued by LDA 
(Respondent No. 3) dated 06.11.1991 and after due diligence, it was 
confirmed that the suit property was in the name of the Petitioner and free 

2 
C. R. No. 26520 of 2019 
from all kinds of liabilities. Before the target date, the Respondent issued 
cross cheque bearing No. 1486014 dated 02.05.2014 in favour of the 
Petitioner and provided a copy of the same to her with the request to initiate 
the process of transfer of the suit property and receive the balance sale 
consideration as per her own choice. However, the Petitioner deliberately 
lingered on the execution of sale deed on one pretext or the other despite 
repeated requests and also did not pay the double amount of earnest money 
in case of her refusal to transfer the suit property as stipulated in the 
Agreement. Even, Respondent No. 2, property dealer, who had guaranteed 
the due execution of the sale transaction, was also contacted but in vain. As 
such, on account of failure of the Petitioner to perform her part of the 
Agreement, the Respondent has suffered huge loss. Hence, this suit. 
3. 
The Petitioner, in her written statement, admitted the due execution of 
the Agreement and receipt of earnest money. However, it was alleged that 
balance sale consideration was not paid on or before the target date despite 
her repeated requests and as such, the Agreement stood rescinded as per its 
terms. It was also asserted that the Petitioner issued three notices dated 
06.05.2014, 14.05.2014 and 22.05.2014, respectively, in this behalf which 
were not responded to by the Respondent. It was further averred that she had 
purchased 01 Kanal property from one Mirza Tahir Baig for total 
consideration of Rs. 12,800,000/- and paid an earnest money of Rs. 
4,100,000/- which was confiscated due to non-payment of remaining sale 
consideration by the Respondent within the stipulated target date of 
15.05.2014 and as such, she has suffered irreparable loss and injury. It was 
next revealed that the Respondent arranged only Rs. 2,100,000/- as balance 
sale consideration out of Rs. 07-Million which was deposited in her account 
without her consent and the same was later returned to the Respondent 
through cheque bearing No. 1409227 dated 02.06.2014 because he did not 
fulfill his obligation to pay the balance sale consideration within the target 
date. As such, the Respondent is neither entitled to receive the double 
amount of earnest money nor the relief of specific performance of the 
Agreement.

4. 
Respondent No. 2, the property dealer, in his written statement also 
admitted the due execution of the Agreement between the Petitioner and the 
Respondent including payment and receipt of earnest money. He asserted 
that he provided a copy of cheque qua balance sale consideration issued by 
the Respondent to the Petitioner and asked her to initiate the process of 
transfer of the suit property but she showed her continuous reluctance and 
refused to transfer the same as well as pay back double amount of earnest 
money. As such, Respondent No. 2 supported the version of the Respondent 
to the effect that the Petitioner did not perform her part of the Agreement.  
5. 
Out of the divergent pleadings of the parties, the Trial Court framed 
the following issues on 02.06.2015:- 
1.  
Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the decree for specific 
performance of agreement to sell dated 05-02-2014 as prayed 
for? OPP 
2. 
Whether the plaintiff is entitled to receive double earnest money 
amounting to Rs.1,00,00,000/- on account of failure of 
defendant No.2 to perform her part of agreement to sell? OPP 
3.  
Whether the plaintiff was willing and still ready to perform his 
part of contract? OPP 
4.  
Whether the time was essence of the contract and the plaintiff 
failed to pay the remaining consideration of Rs.70,00,000/- 
within three months i.e. till 05-05-2014, hence the agreement to 
sell dated 05-02-2014 has become rescinded?OPD1 
5.  
Whether the plaintiff has no cause of action to file the instant 
suit against the defendants? OPD 
6.  
Whether the suit of the plaintiff is not maintainable in its 
present form, hence the same is liable to be dismissed with 
special costs? OPD 
7.  
Relief. 
6. 
After recording respective evidence of the parties, the Trial Court 
proceeded to Decree the suit of the Respondent. The Petitioner preferred an 
Appeal which was also dismissed by the Appellate Court. Hence, this Civil 
Revision. 
7. 
Learned counsel for the Petitioner contended that the Courts below 
have not addressed the question of readiness and willingness on the part of 

4 
C. R. No. 26520 of 2019 
the Respondent to perform his part of the Agreement and his financial ability 
to pay the balance sale consideration on or before the target date as it was 
proved from bank statement of the Respondent (Ex. P-3) that he never had 
requisite funds to pay the balance sale consideration. The Respondent had 
not specifically pleaded in the plaint that he was always ready and willing to 
perform his part of the Agreement and had financial ability to pay the 
balance sale consideration within the target date. Specific performance is a 
discretionary relief and in the instant case, the same has not been awarded 
through structured discretion exercised by the Courts below. This is evident 
from the fact that at the time of filing of the suit, no tangible effort was made 
by the Respondent to deposit the balance sale consideration and the same 
was paid after one year from the date of institution of the suit in compliance 
with the order dated 22.05.2015. The lack of financial ability of the 
Respondent to pay the balance sale consideration on or before the target date 
is evident from his conduct supported by interim orders on record. The 
observations of the Courts below to the effect that the suit property was 
mortgaged cannot be read in evidence as no such plea was taken by the 
Respondent in his plaint and as such, evidence beyond pleadings could not 
have been made basis to hold that the Petitioner was in default of her part of 
the Agreement.  
8. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the Respondent contended that the 
Respondent specifically pleaded in his plaint that he had performed his part 
of the Agreement, whereas, the Petitioner did not perform her part of the 
Agreement which was also endorsed by Respondent No. 2 who was a 
guarantor of the sale transaction. The payment of Rs. 2,100,000/- to the 
Petitioner was made merely to facilitate her in redeeming the suit property 
which though returned yet proves that the Respondent had financial 
resources to pay the balance sale consideration. The cross cheque was issued 
in a bonafide manner requiring the Petitioner to initiate the process of 
transfer of the suit property and take the balance sale consideration as per 
her choice at the time of execution of the sale deed or transfer of the suit 
property as agreed in the Agreement. However, the Petitioner neither took 
any step to initiate the process of transfer of the suit property by obtaining 

5 
C. R. No. 26520 of 2019 
no objection certificate from LDA nor redeemed the portion of the suit 
property in possession of the mortgagee. Hence, the concurrent findings of 
fact recorded by the Courts below are not liable to be reversed.  
9. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
10. 
The execution of the Agreement and receipt of earnest money is 
admitted. The dispute is essentially with respect to determination as to 
whether the Petitioner or the Respondent failed to perform her or his part of 
the Agreement. It is admitted on record that the Respondent as buyer of the 
suit property issued cross cheque dated 02.05.2014 in the name of the 
Petitioner before the target date of 05.05.2014, a copy of which was handed 
over to the Petitioner requiring her to initiate the process of transfer in the 
LDA. However, there is no evidence on record that the Petitioner applied for 
no objection certificate which was required for transfer of the suit property 
either through execution of sale deed or directly before the LDA. She also 
did not take any step for execution of the sale deed or transfer of the suit 
property in the LDA in the name of the Respondent. The balance sale 
consideration was payable at the time of execution of sale deed or transfer 
before the LDA as per the contents of the Agreement. Therefore, the plea 
that the Respondent did not have the financial ability to complete the 
transaction was immature and is based on assumption that he did not have 
requisite funds in the bank account regarding which he had issued the cross 
cheque in favour of the Petitioner because payment could have been made in 
cash or through pay order from another account or by any other means. The 
Petitioner was bound to initiate the process of sale transaction and may well 
have required the payment of balance sale consideration through pay order 
or cash or by any other mode at the time of execution of sale deed or transfer 
of the suit property before LDA but that time did not arrive due to lapse on 
the part of the Petitioner. The Petitioner had stated in her written statement 
that she had issued notices dated 06.05.2014, 14.05.2014 and 22.05.2014 but 
the same were not brought on record and were issued after the target date of 
05.05.2014. Although, the Respondent had not pleaded that he paid Rs. 
2,100,000/- to the Petitioner to facilitate her to clear the mortgage qua the 
suit property yet the same fact was revealed by the Petitioner in her written 

6 
C. R. No. 26520 of 2019 
statement, perusal thereof shows that the said amount was deposited by the 
Respondent in the bank account of the Petitioner on 28.05.2014 but the same 
was returned vide cheque dated 02.06.2014. Both the above dates are 
beyond the target date which depicts that the said amount was extended 
merely to redeem the mortgage over the suit property which had not been 
cleared before the target date. The Petitioner had clearly undertaken in the 
Agreement that the suit property was free from all charges or liens but Mark-
D on record shows that the suit property had been mortgaged to one Abdul 
Sattar (the Petitioner in connected C. R. No. 32672 / 2022) on 30.09.2013, 
for a period of two years, redeemable on three months’ notice upon payment 
of mortgage money. Notwithstanding the validity of the mortgage deed, as 
an attending circumstance, it is established that payment of Rs. 2,100,000/- 
was infact for redeeming the mortgage since the amount of Rs. 2,100,000/- 
matches with the amount of mortgage money and further proves that the 
factum of mortgage was not incorporated in the LDA record which shows 
the conduct of the Petitioner that she not only concealed the fact of mortgage 
in the Agreement but also failed to clear the suit property from all 
encumbrances before the target date. As such, the Petitioner was not in a 
position to hand over vacant possession of the suit property to the 
Respondent at the target date.   
11. 
Record further depicts that vide Order dated 17.06.2014, the Trial 
Court granted restraining order in favour of the Respondent subject to 
deposit of remaining sale consideration. On 12.07.2014, counsel for the 
Respondent recorded his statement that the Respondent is ready to pay the 
remaining sale consideration and deposited original cross cheque in the 
name of the Petitioner with the stipulation that the Petitioner can encash the 
same and the Respondent would be liable for the consequences. However, 
learned counsel for the Petitioner refused to receive the same. Later, vide 
order dated 12.03.2015, the Trial Court directed the Respondent to deposit 
the balance sale consideration in the Court within one month. After settling 
mode of payment through subsequent orders, the Trial Court vide order 
dated 22.05.2015 granted absolute last opportunity to the Respondent to 
deposit the balance sale consideration within thirty days and in compliance 

7 
C. R. No. 26520 of 2019 
thereof, the same was paid in the Court. Under these circumstances, it cannot 
be conclusively conferred that the Respondent did not have financial ability 
to complete the sale transaction. This is especially so since the Respondent 
had promptly instituted the suit on 17.06.2014 i.e. 1-1/2 months after the 
target date. The Petitioner, in her written statement, while admitting the 
transaction did not seek immediate payment of remaining sale consideration 
by demonstrating her willingness to execute sale deed but sought rescission 
of the Agreement. 
12. 
The Trial Court while rendering its finding as to whether time was 
essence of the Agreement, concluded that the alleged sale transaction by the 
Petitioner with Mirza Tahir Baig could not be proved by the Petitioner who 
as DW-1 deposed regarding her ignorance with respect to the agreement 
with Mirza Tahir Baig as the same was executed by her deceased son. 
Further, the alleged agreement with Mirza Tahir Baig (Ex. D-1) allegedly 
executed on 11.02.2014 neither mentioned the names of the marginal 
witnesses nor the said Mirza Tahir Baig was produced as a witness to verify 
its contents. As such, the asserted fact by the Petitioner that she has suffered 
injury for lack of payment of balance sale consideration on due date by the 
Respondent and that time was essence of the Agreement was not proved by 
her. 
13. 
The upshot of the above discussion is that the Courts below have 
rendered well-reasoned and sound Judgments after due appreciation of 
evidence and taking into account all aspects of the case. The concurrent 
Judgments passed by the Courts below are unexceptional which require no 
interference by this Court in exercise of revisional jurisdiction under Section 
115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. 
14. 
In view of the above, this Civil Revision is devoid of any merit and 
the same is hereby dismissed.
