JAWAD HASSAN, J. The 
Petitioner 
has 
invoked 
the 
constitutional jurisdiction of this Court under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”) 
by challenging a quasi-judicial order dated 07.06.2018 passed by the 
Respondent No.2 pursuant to directions issued in W.P.No.2836 of 2017 
dated 09.10.2017. The Petitioner has also challenged letter dated 
23.09.2020 whereby his application for reinstatement in service was 
dismissed. 
2. 
Facts of the case, as per petition, are that the Petitioner was 
appointed as Chairman Personal Staff vide offer letter dated 04.04.2007 
on daily wages initially for a period of 89 days which was subsequently 
extended from time to time and he was terminated on 13.03.2010. He 
was re-employed on 17.02.2012 and again his services were terminated 
vide order dated 17.02.2016 on the ground of involvement in a criminal 
case. The Petitioner, after his bail, approached the Respondents with an 

Writ Petition No.319 of 2021                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   2 
application to allow him to rejoin services alongwith regularization 
however, his request was not acceded to. Non-decision of that 
application by the Respondents prompted him to file Writ Petition 
No.2836 of 2017 which was disposed of vide order dated 07.06.2018 
with direction to decide above-stated application pursuant to which 
impugned order dated 07.06.2018 was passed. Hence this petition.  
3.  
Learned counsel for the Petitioner inter-alia contended that the 
impugned orders are illegal and unlawful; that neither show cause 
notice was given to the Petitioner nor opportunity of hearing was 
provided to him; that the Respondents have granted benefit of 
regularization to certain persons appointed along with the Petitioners 
but discriminatory treatment has meted out with him; that fundamental 
rights of the Petitioner are being infringed which need consideration of 
this Court. He relied on “BOARD OF INTERMEDIATE AND 
SECONDARY EDUCATION, MULTAN through Chairman and another 
versus MUHAMMAD SAJID and others” (2019 SCMR 233), 
“WAPDA through Chairman and others versus ABDUL GHAFFFAR 
and others” 
(2018 SCMR 380), “KASHIF ZAFAR versus 
POSTMASTER-GENERAL and others” (2013 SCMR 726) and 
“GOVERNMENT OF PUNJAB through Secretary Education, Civil 
Secretariat, Lahore and others versus SAMEENA PARVEEN and 
others” (2009 SCMR 1).  
4. 
On the other hand, learned counsel for the Respondents filed 
report and parawise comments and vehemently opposed the arguments 
advanced by the learned counsel for the Petitioner and prayed for 
dismissal of the petition on the grounds that the Petitioner was 
employed on daily wages and after his termination, he has no vested 
right to be regularized or extension of his contract period; that the 
Petitioner was treated as per terms and conditions of his daily wages 
employment which he duly accepted at the time of appointment, 
therefore, now at this stage he cannot deviate from the same.  
5. 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through the 
available record.

6. 
Admittedly, the services of the Petitioner were engaged by the 
Respondents purely on daily wages initially for a period of 89 days vide 
appointment letter dated 16.03.2007, relevant terms and conditions 
thereof are reproduced hereunder:: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7. 
It is quite evident from clause-1 of above that this offer of 
appointment was only for a period of 89 days which may be terminable 
without assigning any reason however, it may be extended subject to 
satisfactory performance. While clause-6 reveals that this daily wages 
employment neither confer any right of permanent job nor any privilege 
of regular appointment will be claimed in future whereas clause-7 
reveals that this employment could be treated as cancelled in case of 
non-fulfilment of the prescribed accessories and not appearing for duty 
on time. Record reveals that the said period of work was extended from 
time to time and ultimately it was discontinued on 13.03.2010 in terms 
of clause-7, referred to above. However, on application of the Petitioner, 
he was re-appointed on 17.12.2012 under the same terms and conditions 
of initial appointment letter that too was discontinued on 17.02.2016. 
The Court is of the considered view that the Petitioner, at the time of 
joining, has accepted all the terms and conditions of his daily wages 
employment, cannot resile from the same at a belated stage. I fortified 
my view seeking guidance from the judgment passed by Supreme Court 
of Pakistan in “Miss NAUREEN NAZ BUTT Versus PAKISTAN 
INTERNATIONAL AIRLINES through Chairman, PIA and others” 
(2020 SCMR 1625) by upholding the judgment of Division Bench of 
this 
Court 
“PAKISTAN 
INTERNATIONAL 
AIRLINES 
Versus 
NAUREEN BUTT” (2017 PLC (C.S.) 923) holding that “the established 
law is that a contract employee, whose period of contract employment 
expires by afflux of time, carry no vested right to remain in employment 

Writ Petition No.319 of 2021                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   4 
of the employer and the Courts cannot force the employer to reinstate or 
extend the contract of the employee”. Reliance is also placed on 
“GOVERNMENT OF KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA through Chief 
Secretary, Peshawar and others Versus INTIZAR ALI and others”  
(2022 SCMR 472) wherein the Supreme Court has held that 
“temporary/contract/project employees have no vested right to claim 
regularization. The direction for regularization, absorption or 
permanent continuance cannot be issued unless the employee 
claiming regularization had been appointed in pursuance of a regular 
recruitment in accordance with relevant rules and against the 
sanctioned vacant posts, which admittedly is not the case before us. 
This Court in the case of PTCL v. Muhammad Samiullah (2021 SCMR 
998) has categorically held that ad-hoc, temporary or contract 
employee has no vested right of regularization and this type of 
appointment does not create any vested right of regularization in 
favour of the appointee”.  
8. 
A ground of long-standing length of service is agitated by the 
Petitioner. Recently, the Supreme Court of Pakistan in “DEPUTY 
DIRECTOR FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION FATA through 
Additional Chief Secretary FATA, Peshawar and others Versus Dr. LAL 
MARJAN and others” (2022 SCMR 566) has held that “long service is 
not ground for regularization and it has to be supported by legislation 
and is not an automatically accruing right”. Moreover, it was nowhere 
mentioned in the appointment letter that it was a job of permanent nature 
or the same was likely to be permanent in future. Recently, the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in “GOVERNMENT OF KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA 
through Secretary Forest, Peshawar and others Versus SHER AMAN 
and others” (2022 SCMR 406) has held as under: 
“When an employee accepted a post in a 
project, he was aware of the fact that the 
project would come to an end on its 
completion or cessation of its funding (as the 
case may be) and with that, his employment 
would also come to an end. Forcing the 
Government to "accommodate/adjust" such 
employees was not only a transgression of the 

Writ Petition No.319 of 2021                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   5 
powers vested with the High Court under Art. 
199 of the Constitution, but was also a burden 
on the Government Exchequer which the court 
was not at liberty to place. Employer had the 
prerogative to decide the terms and conditions 
of an employee's contract, and it was not for 
the court to step into the shoes of the employer 
and force him to employ someone for whom 
there was no available post and even if there 
was one, without following due process, 
procedure and criteria”. 
 
9. 
Now the heart of controversy involved in this petition is the 
grant of benefit of regularization to certain persons appointed with the 
Petitioner, which according to him, formed basis for discrimination. The 
counsel for the Petitioner has persistently put much emphasis that the 
Petitioner was entitled to regularization of his services as the 
Respondents have regularized similarly placed persons. The fact of 
appointment of the Petitioner as Chairman Personal Staff initially for a 
period of 89 days and subsequent extensions therein is not disputed by 
all hands. The only grievance agitated by the Petitioner is that the 
Respondents have regularized the services of similarly placed persons 
while they have refused this relief to the Petitioner for reasons best 
known to them. While on the other hand, the counsel for the 
Respondents stated that daily wager cannot be granted the benefit of 
regularization without advertising the post in terms of order 20.03.2019 
of the Supreme Court of Pakistan passed in Civil Petition No.301-L to 
309-L and 316-L to 316-L of 2019 and thus benefit of regularization 
cannot be granted to the Petitioner. As the matter in hand relates to the 
policy of the Respondents, therefore, Court cannot interfere into it. It is 
not in the domain of the Courts to embark upon an inquiry as to whether 
a particular policy is wise and acceptable or whether better policy could 
be drafted. The Court can only interfere if the policy framed is 
absolutely capricious and non-informed by reasons, or totally arbitrary, 
offending the basic requirement of the Constitution. It was for the 
Respondents to decide how and in what manner the reservations should 
be made and such a policy decision normally would not be open to 
challenge subject to its passing the test of reasonableness. The Supreme 

Writ Petition No.319 of 2021                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   6 
Court of Pakistan in “The SECRETARY PUNJAB PUBLIC SERVICE 
COMMISSION, LAHORE and others Versus AAMIR HAYAT and 
others” (2019 SCMR 124) has held that “courts could not interfere in 
lawful exercise of discretion by the concerned departments and 
substitute lawful decisions of the departments, by their own”. In case of 
“M. NAZIR AHMAD Versus MUHAMMAD ASLAM and others”(2013 
SCMR 363) it was held that “An employer has the discretion to 
formulate appropriate policy viz.a.viz job qualification and criteria for 
various positions in line with its peculiar requirements and 
organizational structure hence no person had a vested right to be 
appointed on a post rather the authorities made a selection for the post 
as per criteria set out in Rules/policy and had to find the most suitable 
candidate for the job who could capably discharge the duties”. Reliance 
is also placed on “SECRETARY ECONOMIC AFFAIRS DIVISION, 
ISLAMABAD and others Versus ANWARUL HAQ AHMED and others” 
(2013 SCMR 1687) whereby the Supreme Court has held that 
“educational institutions are independent to follow policy for admission 
including affairs relating to changing conditions for endowment funds or 
fee, either under the policy given by the government or adopted by the 
college”.  Even otherwise, the Petitioner has neither made party to this 
petition the named persons nor any document, in this regard, has brought 
on record by her hence it cannot be said that the Respondents have 
treated her indifferently or given discriminatory treatment to him. The 
issue of discrimination has deliberated in details by the Supreme Court 
of Pakistan in “GOVERNMENT OF KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA 
through Chief Secretary and others Versus Syed SADIQ SHAH and 
others” (2021 SCMR 747) wherein it has held that: 
“Article 25 of the Constitution, guarantees to 
every person the right to equality before the 
law and the equal protection of the laws. The 
expression "equal before law" is a declaration 
of equality of all persons irrespective of 
gender, race, religion, colour, caste, creed, 
status and language etc, implying thereby the 
absence of any privilege in favour of any 
individual. The guiding principle of Article 25 
is that all persons and things similarly 

Writ Petition No.319 of 2021                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   7 
circumstanced shall be treated alike both in 
respect of privileges conferred and liabilities 
imposed. Equality before law means that 
amongst equals should be equal and equally 
administered and that like should be treated 
alike. Hence what it forbids is discrimination 
between persons who are substantially in 
similar circumstances or conditions. However, 
Article 25 does not forbid different treatment 
of un-equals. The rule is rather that alike 
should be treated equally and that unlike 
should be treated differently. As a matter of 
fact all persons are not alike or equal in all 
respects. Application of the same laws or 
yardstick uniformly to all of them will, 
therefore, be inconsistent with the principal of 
equality. To avoid that situation laws must 
distinguish between those who are equals and 
to whom they must apply and those who are 
different and to whom they should not apply. 
In 
fact 
identical 
treatment 
in 
unequal 
circumstances would amount to inequality. So 
a 
reasonable 
classification 
or 
sub-
classification is only not permitted but is 
necessary if society is to progress. It must 
always rest upon some real and substantial 
distinction bearing a just and reasonable 
relation to the object sought to be achieved by 
the authority.  
Persons may be classified or further sub-
classified into entities and such entities may be 
treated differently if there is a reasonable 
basis for such difference. Article 25 forbids 
class legislation but it does not forbid 
classification or differentiation which rests 
upon reasonable grounds of distinction. The 
classification however must not be arbitrary, 
artificial or evasive but must be based on some 
real and substantial bearing, a just and 
reasonable relation to the object sought to be 
achieved by the legislation.  
Principle of equality does not mean that every 
law, policy matter, notification, administrative 
or executive order etc must have universal 
application to all the persons who by nature, 
attainment or circumstances are not in the 
same position”.  
 
10. 
As the Petitioner was a daily wager employee and was governed 
by the principle of master and servant, therefore; he does not have any 

Writ Petition No.319 of 2021                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   8 
vested right to seek extension of the contract/regularization as a matter 
of right rather it was the prerogative of the competent authority either to 
dispense with services of such employee or continue with the same by 
extending the contract or regularizing the services as per the policy. 
Moreover, it is an established principle that where employment is on 
contract, there is a relationship of master and servant and in such like 
cases the constitutional petition under Article 199 of the Constitution is 
not maintainable. Reliance is placed on “PAKISTAN INTERNATIONAL 
AIRLINES 
and 
others 
Versus 
NOUREEN 
NAZ 
BUTT”  
(2017 PLC (C.S.) 923) which has been upheld by the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in “Miss NAUREEN NAZ BUTT Versus PAKISTAN 
INTERNATIONAL AIRLINES through Chairman, PIA and others” 
(2020 SCMR 1625). 
11. 
Basically, the Petitioner has impugned two orders dated 
23.09.2020 and 07.06.2018. First order relates to termination of contract 
which was passed by the Respondents on the application of the 
Petitioner for reinstatement/restoration of service whereas second order 
dated 07.06.2018 was passed pursuant to directions of this Court. In the 
said order it was observed that during service, the Petitioner had shown 
poor conduct and his initial appointment was terminated on account of 
his absence from duty. Pertinently, the impugned order dated 07.06.2018 
was passed in the year 2018 but interestingly has been challenged after 
lapse of almost two years, five months and nineteen days without 
explaining any convincing reasonable cause for the inordinate delay, as 
such principle of laches is applicable upon this case as three months’ 
time is considered reasonable for a party to assail an adverse order in 
writ jurisdiction of this Court. The Supreme Court of Pakistan in “CIVIL 
AVIATION AUTHORITY through Director General and 3 others Versus 
Mir ZULFIQAR ALI and another” (2016 SCMR 183) has held as under: 
 “The respondent No.1, who appeared in person, 
despite opportunity failed to explain or justify 
the delay. Since the petition was filed after a 
lapse of almost 10 years and that too without 
any justification or explanation for such delay, 
the same ought to have been dismissed as such” 
 

Writ Petition No.319 of 2021                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   9 
  
In “STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN through Governor and 
another Versus IMTIAZ ALI KHAN and others” (2012 SCMR 280) it 
has held as under:  
“laches is a doctrine whereunder a party which 
may have a right, which was otherwise 
enforceable, loses such right to the extent of its 
enforcement if it is found by the Court of a law 
that its case is hit by the doctrine of 
laches/limitation. Right remains with the party 
but it cannot enforce it. The limitation is 
examined by the Limitation Act or by special 
laws which have inbuilt provisions for seeking 
relief against any grievance within the time 
specified under the law and if party aggrieved 
do not approach the appropriate forum within 
the stipulated period/time, the grievance though 
remains but it cannot be redressed because if on 
one hand there was a right with a party which 
he could have enforced against the other but 
because of principle of limitation/laches, same 
right then vests/accrues in favour of the opposite 
party”. 
 
   
It was further held by Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
“MEMBER (S&R)/CHIEF SETTLEMENT COMMISSIONER, BOARD 
OF REVENUE, PUNJAB, LAHORE and another Versus Syed 
ASHFAQUE ALI and others” (P L D 2003 Supreme Court 132)  as 
under: 
“On account of Laches in setting the machinery 
of law into motion they have indeed disentitled 
themselves to the exercise of discretionary and 
equitable jurisdiction, which in all cases must be 
exercised in order to foster the ends of justice 
and to right a wrong. Writ jurisdiction is 
undoubtedly discretionary and extraordinary in 
nature which may not be invoked by a party who 
demonstrates a style of slackness and laxity on 
his part. Furthermore, if a party does not choose 
legal remedy available under the Statute strictly 
speaking Constitutional jurisdiction of the High 
Court cannot be exercised in his favour. Law is 
well-settled that a patty guilty of gross 
negligence and laches is not entitled to the 
equitable relief. One who seeks equity must 
show that equities lean in his favour. In the facts 
and circumstances of the appeal we are, 

Writ Petition No.319 of 2021                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   10 
therefore, in no manner of doubt that the High 
Court was not competent to exercise its writ 
jurisdiction conferred under Article 199 of the 
Constitution”. 
 
12. 
It is well settled principle that law helps the vigilant and not the 
indolent. Reliance is placed on “AFTAB IQBAL KHAN KHICHI and 
another Versus Messrs UNITED DISTRIBUTORS PAKISTAN LTD. 
KARACHI” (1999 SCMR 1326). Moreover, the judgments referred to 
by learned counsel for the Petitioner cannot be relied upon being 
distinguishable from the facts and circumstances of the case as each and 
every case has its own merits.  
13. 
In view of above discussion, I am not inclined to interfere with 
the impugned order which otherwise have been passed aptly. 
Resultantly, the instant petition stands dismissed on merit as well as on 
principle of laches.
