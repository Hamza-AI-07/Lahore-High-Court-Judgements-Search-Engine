{petitioners/accused persons in case arising out of F.I.R. No.1743/2022            
dated: 22.06.2022 registered under Sections: 302, 324, 148, 149, PPC read with 
Section: 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 (subsequently, offences under 
Sections: 337-A(i), 337-F(iii), 337-F(vi) and 120-B PPC were added during 
investigation of the case) at Police Station: Shahdra Town, District: Lahore}, 
following prayer has been made: - 
  
“In view of the above submissions, it is, therefore, most 
respectfully prayed that this petition may kindly be accepted and 
the impugned order dated 18.03.2023 passed by learned 
respondent No.2 may kindly be set aside in the interest of justice 
and the case FIR No.1743/2022 may kindly be transferred from 
the Anti-Terrorism Court to The Court of Ordinary Jurisdiction 
in the interest of justice.  
 
Any other relief, which this Hon’ble Court deems fit and 
proper may also kindly be awarded to the petitioner.”  
 
 
 
2. 
  
Brief however necessary facts for decision of this petition are that 
Muhammad Ijaz Khan (complainant/now respondent No.3 in the instant 
petition) got registered case vide F.I.R. No.1743/2022 (mentioned above) 
against accused persons including present petitioners; subsequently, he got 
recorded supplementary statement dated: 24.09.2022 whereby he nominated 
five more accused persons namely Manzoor alias Paa, Sakhawat, Hamid, 

Criminal Revision No.24470/2023

Liaqat Ali and Sana Bibi; during investigation of the case, Sarfraz Ahmad, 
Imtiaz Hussain alias Kaka and Imran were declared innocent and thereafter 
incomplete challan report in the case was prepared and sent to the Court for 
trial where application under Section: 23 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 was 
filed by present petitioners, which was dismissed vide impugned order              
dated: 18.03.2023 passed by learned Judge Anti-Terrorism Court-I, Lahore; 
relevant portions of said order are hereby reproduced: - 
  
“Through application under consideration the petitioners/ 
accused requested the court for the transfer of the case to the 
court of ordinary jurisdiction because section 6 & 7 of Anti-
Terrorism Act, 1997 do not attract to the case of prosecution and 
the learned apex court has opined that inspite of grave, shocking, 
brutal, gruesome or horrifying offence it is not termed as 
terrorism if it is not designed to create terror amongst the general 
massive.” 
 
  
“Perusal of record reveals that when complainant party in 
the present case after appearing before the court of Rai Nawaz 
Marth, ASJ Frozewala in case FIR No.524/2020 got registered u/s 
302, 324, 109 PPC was on its way the accused made brutal firing 
upon them due to which Shahid Khan and Sajjad Khan died at the 
spot whereas Ameer Hamza s/o Muhammad Sajjad died at Mayo 
Hospital, Lahore. Apart from deceased Malik Kamran and Zawar 
@ Saddam also received serious injuries at the hands of accused 
and in order to decide the fate of application filed u/s 23 of Anti-
Terrorism Act, 1997 the place of occurrence is very relevant. In 
this regard not only unscaled site plan prepared by Investigating 
Officer is part of record but the scaled site plan clearly contained 
point 'W' the place where four fire shots made by accused hit the 
court room of Rai Nawaz Marth, learned ASJ Frozewala. The 
offence committed by accused within the court premises while 
damaging its wall is a scheduled offence and as per section 12 of 
Anti- Terrorism Act, 1997 and Para No.13 of judgment relied 
upon as PLD 2020 SC 61 it clearly exclude the jurisdiction of 
ordinary court. 
 
  
In view of above as the provisions of section 6 & 7 of Anti- 
Terrorism Act, 1997 are attracted in this case and only this court 
has jurisdiction to decide the challan against accused, therefore, 
application filed u/s 23 of Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 being devoid 
of any force stands dismissed.” 
 
 
3.   
 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that impugned order is 
against the law as well as facts of the case, therefore, same is not sustainable in 
the eyes of law; finally prays for setting aside the impugned order.  
4.   
 
Learned Additional Prosecutor General and learned counsel for 
respondent No.3 while supporting the impugned order pray for dismissal of this 
petition.   
5. 
 
Arguments heard and available record perused.

6.  
 
In criminal law, mens rea i.e. guilt mind which refers to criminal 
intent carries the vital importance to determine the nature as well as gravity of 
the alleged act or omission subject matter of the crime and resultantly deciding 
the question of jurisdiction also. Almost every crime spreads feelings of 
insecurity, harassment and fear however quantum of said effect i.e. feelings 
varies from person to person and area to area e.g. sometime even pallet fired 
from air gun hitting bird or animal resulting into oozing of the blood, can cause 
fear to the person who has never seen such episode earlier in his life and not 
acquainted with firearm weapons as well as their use whereas the person 
familiar with such events will not take any serious note of it even if assault rifle 
like Kalashnikov has been used for committing the occurrence, therefore, 
merely due to magnitude of the effects of the crime, it cannot be termed as 
“terrorism” falling in the ambit of Section: 6 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 
and punishable under Section: 7 of the Act ibid, if it has been committed due to 
personal enmity/vendetta; in this regard, guidance has been sought from the 
case of “GHULAM HUSSAIN and others versus The STATE and others” 
(PLD 2020 Supreme Court 61); relevant portion from said case law is hereby 
reproduced: -  
“15.  The resume of our legislative developments in the field of 
terrorism shows, as already observed in the case of Basharat Ali 
(supra), that with different laws and definitions of terrorist act 
or terrorism the emphasis has been shifting from one criterion 
to another including the gravity of the act, lethal nature of the 
weapon used, plurality of culprits, number of victims, impact 
created by the act and effect of fear and insecurity brought 
about or likely to be created in the society by the action. The 
last definition of a 'terrorist act' contained in section 6 of the 
Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 squarely focused on the effect of fear 
and insecurity intended to be created by the act or actually 
created by the act or the act having the potential of creating 
such an effect of fear and insecurity in the society. It, however, 
appears that subsequently the legislature did not feel convinced 
of the aptness or correctness of that definition and resultantly 
the erstwhile definition of a 'terrorist act' contained in section 6 
of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 was repealed and a totally fresh 
and new definition of 'terrorism' was introduced through an 
amended section 6 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. The 
legislature had probably realized by then that an effect of an act 
may not always be a correct indicator of the nature of such an 
act as every crime, especially of violence against person or 
property, does create some sense of fear and insecurity in some 
section of the society and a definition of terrorism based upon 
the magnitude or potential of an effect created or intended to be 
created or having a potential of creating would necessarily 
require a premature, speculative and imaginary quantification 
of the effect so as to determine the nature of the act in order to 

Criminal Revision No.24470/2023 
4 
decide about the jurisdiction of a criminal court to try such an 
act. That surely was an unsure test and the result of such a 
premature, speculative and presumptive test could vary from 
court to court and from Judge to Judge reminding a legal 
scholar of the Star Chamber and the early days of a Court of 
Equity in England where equity was said to vary with the size of 
the Chancellor's foot. The new definition of 'terrorism' 
introduced through the amended section 6 of the Anti-Terrorism 
Act, 1997 as it stands today appears to be closer to the 
universally understood concept of terrorism besides being 
easier to understand and apply. The earlier emphasis on the 
speculative effect of the act has now given way to a clearly 
defined mens rea and actus reus. The amended clause (b) of 
subsection (1) of section 6 now specifies the 'design' and clause 
(c) of subsection (1) of section 6 earmarks the 'purpose' which 
should be the motivation for the act and the actus reus has been 
clearly mentioned in subsection (2) of section 6 and now it is 
only when the actus reus specified in subsection (2) of section 6 
is accompanied by the requisite mens rea provided for in clause 
(b) or clause (c) of subsection (1) of section 6 that an action can 
be termed as 'terrorism'. Thus, it is no longer the fear or 
insecurity actually created or intended to be created or likely to 
be created which would determine whether the action qualifies 
to be termed as terrorism or not but it is now the intent and 
motivation behind the action which would be determinative of 
the issue irrespective of the fact whether any fear and insecurity 
was actually created or not. After this amendment in section 6 
an action can now be termed as terrorism if the use or threat of 
that action is designed to coerce and intimidate or overawe the 
Government or the public or a section of the public or 
community or sect, etc. or if such action is designed to create a 
sense of fear or insecurity in the society or the use or threat is 
made for the purpose of advancing a religious, sectarian or 
ethnic cause, etc. Now creating fear or insecurity in the society 
is not by itself terrorism unless the motive itself is to create fear 
or insecurity in the society and not when fear or insecurity is 
just a byproduct, a fallout or an unintended consequence of a 
private crime. In the last definition the focus was on the action 
and its result whereas in the present definition the emphasis 
appears to be on the motivation and objective and not on the 
result. Through this amendment the legislature seems to have 
finally appreciated that mere shock, horror, dread or disgust 
created or likely to be created in the society does not  transform 
a private crime into terrorism but terrorism as an ‘ism' is a 
totally different concept which denotes commission of a crime 
with the design or purpose of destabilizing the government, 
disturbing the society or hurting a section of the society with a 
view to achieve objectives which are essentially political, 
ideological or religious. This approach also appears to be in 
harmony with the emerging international perspective and 
perception about terrorism. The international perception is also 
becoming clearer on the point that a violent activity against 
civilians that has no political, ideological or religious aims is 
just an act of criminal delinquency, a felony, or simply an act of 
insanity unrelated to terrorism. This metamorphosis in the anti-
terrorism law in our country has brought about a sea change in 
the whole concept as we have understood it in the past and it is, 
therefore, of paramount importance for all concerned to 

Criminal Revision No.24470/2023 
5 
understand this conceptual modification and transformation in 
its true perspective. 
16.  
For what has been discussed above it is concluded and 
declared that for an action or threat of action to be accepted as 
terrorism within the meanings of section 6 of the Anti-Terrorism 
Act, 1997 the action must fall in subsection (2) of section 6 of 
the said Act and the use or threat of such action must be 
designed to achieve any of the objectives specified in clause (b) 
of subsection (1) of section 6 of that Act or the use or threat of 
such action must be to achieve any of the purposes mentioned in 
clause (c) of subsection (1) of section 6 of that Act. It is clarified 
that any action constituting an offence, howsoever grave, 
shocking, brutal, gruesome or horrifying, does not qualify to be 
termed as terrorism if it is not committed with the design or 
purpose specified or mentioned in clauses (b) or (c) of 
subsection (1) of section 6 of the said Act. It is further clarified 
that the actions specified in subsection (2) of section 6 of that 
Act do not qualify to be labeled or characterized as terrorism if 
such actions are taken in furtherance of personal enmity or 
private vendetta.” 
 
Similarly, case of “SADIQ ULLAH and another versus The STATE and 
another” (2020 S C M R 1422) can also be safely referred and relevant portion 
of the same is also reproduced hereunder: - 
3. There are no benign murders nor the aftermaths of violence 
endured by its victims and anguish suffered by their families can 
be euphemistically quantified in an empirical gauge, though the 
magnitude thereof and concomitant loss differently impact the 
surroundings, inevitably to be gripped by fear and shock, 
however, the intensity of brutality and loss of life, consequent 
thereupon, by themselves do not bring a violent act within the 
contemplated purview of "Terrorism", a distinct phenomena to 
achieve, through violent means, ends other than settlement of 
personal scores, therefore, while the tragedy that befell upon the 
poor soul evokes profound shock and deserves to be 
appropriately visited, on the strength of evidence, so as to 
ensure justice to the family, it nonetheless, cannot be equated 
with "Terrorism" to dock the accused in special jurisdiction, 
therefore, the case is withdrawn from the Court of Judge ATC-I 
Peshawar and entrusted to the learned Sessions Judge 
Peshawar; he shall conclude the trial in jail premises with all 
convenient dispatch by recording evidence of the remaining 
witnesses. The Chief Secretary, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, shall 
make arrangements of holding of trial in jail premises. The 
Inspector General of Police, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, shall ensure 
safe conduct to the witnesses. The impugned judgments are set 
aside; petition is converted into appeal and allowed in the 
above terms.” 
 
Firing in the court premises is triable by Anti-Terrorism Court as per 3rd 
schedule of Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, which is hereby reproduced for ready 
reference: - 
“THE THIRD SCHEDULE 
(Scheduled Offences)  
[See Section 2(t)] 

Criminal Revision No.24470/2023 
6 
 
1. Any act of terrorism within the meaning of this Act including those 
offences which may be added or amended in accordance with the 
provisions of section 34 of this. 
 
2. Any other offence punishable under this Act. 
 
3. Any attempt to commit, or any aid or abetment of, or any 
conspiracy to commit, any of the aforesaid offences.] 
 
2[4. Without prejudice to the generality of the above paragraphs, the 
Antiterrorism Court to the exclusion of any other Court shall try 
the offences relating to the following, namely:-- 
 
(i) 
Abduction or kidnapping for ransom; 
 
(ii) 
use of fire arms or explosives by any device, including 
bomb blast in a mosque, imambargah, church, temple or 
any other place of worship, whether or not any hurt or 
damage is caused thereby; or 
 
(iii) 
firing or use of explosives by any device, including bomb 
blast in the court premises.] 
 
1[(iv)  Hurt caused by corrosive substance or attempt to cause hurt 
by means of a corrosive substance; and 
 
(v)   
Unlawful possession of an explosive substance or abetment 
for such an offence under the Explosive Substances Act, 
1908 (VI of 1908)]” 
                                                                                          (emphasis added) 
 
However, if prima-facie, intention to have firing in or at the court premises is 
not reflecting from the act constituting crime rather it appears that occurrence 
was orchestrated to target opponents due to personal enmity outside the court 
and as a bye product incidentally some bullets hit the outer wall of the court 
premises or outer wall of court room from distance, then there is absolutely no 
intention to have firing in the court and in such state of affairs, act constituting 
the offence/crime irrespective of the huge loss of lives or other things, would 
not be triable by Anti-Terrorism Court under its 3rd schedule. It is relevant to 
mention here that firing in the court has been mention in 3rd schedule of Anti-
Terrorism Act, 1997 for making the case triable by Anti-Terrorism Court 
whereas “firing near or around i.e. in the surrounding of the court” is not 
mentioned in Clause 4 (iii) of 3rd Schedule of Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 and 
same cannot be added therein by the court; in this regard, guidance has been 
sought 
from 
the 
case 
of 
“DEPUTY 
DIRECTOR 
FINANCE 
AND 
ADMINISTRATION FATA through Additional Chief Secretary FATA, 
Peshawar and others versus Dr. LAL MARJAN and others” (2022 S C M R 566); 
relevant portion from Page No.571 of said case law is reproduced hereunder: - 
“It is nobody's case that the provisions of the 2009 Act 
were extended to FATA/PATA by following the aforenoted 
provisions of the Constitution. As such, the learned High Court 

Criminal Revision No.24470/2023 
7 
could not have extended the application of the 2009 Act, or any 
Act of Parliament or the Provincial Assembly for that matter, to 
FATA/PATA on the touchstone of the principle of casus omissus. 
The said principle categorically provides that, where the 
legislature has not provided something in the language of the 
law, the Court cannot travel beyond its jurisdiction and read 
something into the law as the same would be ultra vires the 
powers available to the Court under the Constitution and would 
constitute an order without, jurisdiction. The same would also 
be against the principle of Trichotomy of Powers upon which 
the State functions. All three organs of the State have been given 
specific powers under the law and as such, the said powers 
cannot be overstepped. We are therefore inclined to hold that 
the learned High Court in the impugned judgments has travelled 
beyond its jurisdiction in applying the 2009 Act to the 
Respondents which action is ex facie erroneous, beyond lawful 
authority and without jurisdiction. 
 
Furthermore, case of “SIRAJUD DIN and another versus ALLAH RAKHA 
and others” (PLD 1960 (W.P.) Lahore 261) can also be advantageously 
referred and relevant portion from Page No.264 is hereby reproduced: - 
 
“We cannot read into the words of a section, particularly 
a carefully drafted section, words which are not 
there…....” 
 
 
It goes without saying that in special law, dealing with particular subject, courts 
are required not to depart from its literal construction and it will be narrowly 
interpreted; in this regard, case of “WARIS ALI and 5 others versus The 
STATE” (2017 S C M R 1572) can be safely referred and its relevant portion 
is reproduced below: - 
“20. Another cardinal principle for construing a Penal 
Statute is that if the same transgresses upon the liberty, property 
and life of the citizens, it shall be so construed and interpreted 
to preserve such rights and not in a manner to destroy the same, 
thus, at random application of the provisions of the Special Act 
to the crimes of ordinary nature like the instant one, would be 
neither desirable nor appropriate being not permissible under 
the law. In the case of The State v. Syed Qaim Ali Shah (1992 
SCMR 2192) the same principle was laid down by this Court. 
 
21. In enactments, meant to deal with particular subject 
and purposive in nature, the Courts are required not to depart 
from its literal construction, the same shall be narrowly 
interpreted. Widening the scope of such Statutes would defeat 
the legislative intent therefore, indulging in straining by 
enlarging the scope of the Special Law, intended to cover 
specified crimes and special object, is not permissible course 
because the result and object intended to be achieved by the 
Legislature, 
shall 
go 
waste. 
Unnecessarily 
bringing 
conventional crimes within the mischief provision of the special 
law may result into chaos and the very object of Article 175 of 

Criminal Revision No.24470/2023 
8 
the Constitution and the laws would be defeated besides the 
clear intent of the Legislature. 
 
22. As has been discussed earlier, Penal Statute and that 
too of a harsh nature, must be narrowly examined and by no 
stretch of imagination it shall be given extended meaning to 
cover crime/crimes, not clearly falling within the ambit of the 
same. Carrying forward any legal fiction on any other 
consideration, is not a permissible course in view of the 
universal principle relating to construction of Statute. The 
society has already suffered at the hands of the devils and evil 
minded people, indulging in terrorism and terrorist activities, 
thus, ordinary citizens, charged for crimes committed due to 
personal vendetta, irrespective of the consequences, ensuing in 
the consummation of a crime, shall not be lightly labeled as 
terrorists on account of the damage caused as it is not a 
determinative 
and 
decisive 
factor, 
as 
the 
most 
lethal/sophisticated weapons, fully automatic are conveniently 
available almost in every part of the country. The use of such 
weapons, even by a single person would thus cause multiple 
injuries or even multiple casualties. 
 
  
The situs of the crime with certain limitations is relevant 
to bring it within the fold of mischief provision of Special Act, as 
the offences committed in specified places are squarely 
mentioned in para-4, clauses (ii) and (iii) which are as  
follows:- 
"(ii) Use of fire arms or explosive by any device, 
including bomb blast in a mosque, imambargah, church, 
temple or any other place of worship, whether or not any 
hurt or damage is caused thereby; or 
(iii) firing or use of explosive by any device, including 
bomb blast in the court premises." 
Under section 34 of the Special Act, the Legislature has 
delegated powers authorizing the government to amend the 
Schedules, so as to add any entry thereto or to modify it, 
therefore, when the Legislature has specifically authorized the 
government to make amendment in the Schedule then, the 
Courts of law are not supposed to interpret the provision of the 
Special Act in a way by including any other place in the Third 
Schedule or to exclude any place, specifically mentioned therein 
because it would amount to encroachment on the power of the 
government without any justifiable reason, unless and until the 
provisions of the Third Schedule are struck down by the Court 
on the ground being violative or ultra vires of the mandatory 
provision of the Constitution.” 
 
 
 
In this case, it is own case of the prosecution that accused persons 
committed the occurrence when victim of the case came out from the court and 
reached on the road, so, accused persons neither went inside the court premises 
for committing the occurrence nor made firing upon the victims when they 
were inside the court premises. It goes without saying that intention or         
mens rea i.e. guilt intention is inferred from the acts, facts and circumstances.  

Criminal Revision No.24470/2023 
9 
Hence, prima-facie, there was no intention of the accused persons to target the 
court or victims in the court premises. It is not mentioned in the Crime Report 
(F.I.R.) that accused made firing at the court premises and the fire shots hit wall 
of the court room or its boundary wall, however, it is claim of prosecution that 
as per site plan of the place of occurrence, some signs of hitting of bullets at the 
court premises have been shown but perusal of the site plan reflects that signs 
of hitting some bullets are shown at the outer wall of the court room situated at 
the upper storey and at the outer side of the boundary wall of Katchery, 
Ferozewala. So, by no stretch of the imagination, it cannot be said that firing 
was made in the court or for targeting or hitting the court premises rather it has 
been clearly mentioned in case diary No.107 dated: 23.03.2023 written by 
Muhammad Saleem, Inspector (Incharge Investigating) in the case that there 
was previous litigation and grudge (رنجش) between complainant party and 
accused persons. So, this occurrence took place outside the court premises and 
due to previous enmity/vendetta, hence, occurrence neither constitutes offence 
of terrorism as defined under Section: 6 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 and 
punishable under Section: 7 of the Act ibid nor falls in the Schedule 3 of the 
Act, ibid for the purpose of trial by Anti-Terrorism Court. Thus, Anti-Terrorism 
Court, Lahore fell into legal error while holding through impugned order that 
this case is triable by Anti-Terrorism Court.  
7. 
 
In view of what has been discussed above, impugned order is not 
sustainable in the eyes of the law; therefore, same is hereby set-aide and case is 
ordered to be sent to the court of plenary jurisdiction i.e. Sessions Court, 
Lahore for trial in accordance with law, expeditiously.  Instant revision petition 
stands accepted/allowed.
