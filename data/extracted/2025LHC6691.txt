The Petitioners have called into question the vires of amendments made 
in Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils Act, 1973 (the “Act, 1973”) by virtue 
of the Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils (Amendment) Act, 2025, enacted 
on 29.08.2025 (the “Amendment Act”), as well as, the amendments brought 
about in Pakistan Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils Rules, 1976 (the 
“Rules, 1976”) through Pakistan Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils 
(Amendment) Rules, 2025, as amended vide Pakistan Bar Council’s notification 
No.1581/PBC/SEC/2025 dated 08.09.2025 (the “Amended Rules”). The 
Amendment Act and the Amended Rules, shall hereinafter be collectively 
referred to as the “Impugned Amendments”, where the context so requires.  
3. 
Though multiple challenges have been raised by way of the petitions at 
hand, however, in essence, the Petitioners have argued that the Impugned 
Amendments:  
i. 
are discriminatory in nature, hence violative of Article 25 of the 
Constitution; 
ii. 
cannot be applied to the Provincial Bar Councils Election, 2025, 
as the same have neither been enacted with retrospective effect 
nor any such intendment exists; 
iii. 
if applied retrospectively would destroy the vested rights of the 
petitioners and all other equally placed persons, therefore, the 
alleged retrospective application is sought to be declared illegal 
and unlawful; 
iv. 
violate the fundamental rights of the petitioners and thus, the same 
are sought to be declared ultra vires for being ex facie arbitrary, 
against the principles of fairness and reasonableness;  
v. 
have been brought about in negation of the democratic principles 
and rights and amounts to disenfranchise the petitioners as well as 
their voters/supporters; 
vi. 
are devoid of any rational basis, having been promulgated during 
the currency of the election year;

In a nub, the main thrust of the challenge is directed against the 
amendments of Sections 5A, 5B of the Act, 1973 and Rules 4, 6, 10-B & 175-

Mr. Hassan Abdullah Niazi, learned Advocate, while holding brief in 
W.P. No. 52807 of 2025, argued that by virtue of Impugned Amendments, only 
a specific class of litigant lawyers has been given undue and arbitrary 
advantage to contest the elections of the Provincial Bar Councils, resulting 
discrimination and deprivation of a large segment of legal professionals 
(transactional lawyers, legal academia, legal practitioners practicing at districts 
and tehsil levels, law officers, in house lawyers and retired judicial officers 
etc.); adds that by the dint of Impugned Amendments, the democratic process 
of the Provincial Bar Councils has unlawfully been tainted with executive’s 
unjust intervention; further submitted that the functions of the Provincial Bar 
Councils do not exclusively relate to litigant lawyers since the Provincial Bar 
Councils are regulatory bodies for all lawyers, whereas, the Impugned 
Amendments are to the effect as if the Provincial Bar Councils only regulate 
the Advocates of the Superior Courts, therefore, there is no rational basis for 
imposing such conditions; contended that once the legislation creates a 
classification without intelligible differentia, granting certain privileges to a 
specified group or class, Article 25 of the Constitution becomes applicable; 
pleads that the discriminatory conduct in the context of elections needs to be 
judicially scrutinized, especially when the Impugned Amendments are being 
introduced just two months before the elections; lastly submitted that the 
Impugned Amendments impaired the vested rights of several potential 
candidates and their voters, who seek to contest the elections. While 
responding to a query by this Court, Mr. Hassan Abdullah Niazi, Advocate 
submitted that he has not only impugned the enhancement of eligibility 
threshold to ten(10) years, as supplied under clause (a) of Section 5A of the 
Act, 1973, but all/any such restrictions, be it five(05) years or ten(10) years; 
added that merely for the reason that the un-amended provision (supplying for 
an eligibility threshold of five years) had existed unchallenged on the statute 

W.P. No. 50969 of 2025

book, cannot operate as a bar to the petitioner’s challenge on the ground that 
there is no estoppel against the law. Placed reliance upon I.A. Sharwani v. 
Government of Pakistan (1991 SCMR 1041), Government of Balochistan v. 
Azizullah Memon (PLD 1993 SC 364), Commissioner of Income Tax v. Eli Lily 
Pakistan (2009 SCMR 1279), Javed Jabbar v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 
2003 SC 955), Muhammad Nasir Mahmood  v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD

Ch. Ishtiaq Ahmad Khan, learned Advocate Supreme Court, while 
advancing his arguments in addition to the above submissions, has argued that 
there is no object, reason or rationale in the Impugned Amendments, therefore, 
the same are nullity in the eye of law; while referring to the Amendment Act, 
learned counsel submits that the same is devoid of any statement of objects or 
reasons; further argued that the Impugned Amendments tantamount to impose 
unfair restrictions against right to participate in the elections, therefore, the 
same are violative of the right to free elections and thus amounts to 
infringement of fundamental rights; adds that the natural consequence of the 
Impugned Amendments is the creation of a discriminatory class within the 
legal profession based on political affiliations, hence offends Article 25 of the 
Constitution; submits that the real intent and purpose behind the Impugned 
Amendments is to intrude into the regulatory autonomy of the Bar Councils 
and thus the same amounts to compromise the independence of legal fraternity; 
learned counsel has extensively and overwhelmingly argued that the attempt to 
apply and implement the Impugned Amendments viz the upcoming elections, 
2025 amounts to retrospective application of the law despite clear position that 
neither the Amendment Act professes retrospectivity nor it purports any such 
intendment, therefore, the vested rights of lawyers/petitioners cannot be 
allowed to be infringed as the Impugned Amendments will work as a blanket 

W.P. No. 50969 of 2025 
 
Page 8 
 
exclusion of large segment of legal professionals without any rational basis; 
contends that the spirit of the democratic process and institutional autonomy is 
rooted in an all-inclusive approach and any restrictions must be narrowly 
tailored and interpreted; added that since the five years statutory tenure of 
Provincial Bar Councils is fixed by virtue of Section 4 of the Act, 1973, 
therefore, the inevitable election schedule was meant to be between 01.10.2025 
to 31.12.2025, thus, it must be assumed, without any other possible inference, 
that at the time of promulgation of the Impugned Amendments, the election 
schedule was in vogue for all intents and purposes. He has also referred to a 
show cause notice dated 04.07.2025, issued by the learned Advocate General, 
Punjab/Returning Officer for the election of the Punjab Bar Council, whereby, 
a candidate was called upon to explain as to why he may not be proceeded 
against for the violation of the Code of Conduct of the elections 2025. Learned 
counsel has laid emphasis to the factum of the issuance of code of conduct for 
arguing that the schedule of the election in issue was very much in existence at 
the time of promulgation of the Impugned Amendments, therefore, considering 
the well settled law on the subject that no change(s) in an election process can 
be made after the issuance of election schedule, the Impugned Amendments are 
liable to be declared ultra vires for the purpose of Provincial Bar Councils 
Election, 2025. Learned counsel has also argued the notion of ‘legitimate 
expectation’ while submitting that most of the candidates being affected by the 
Impugned Amendments have extensively campaigned and worked in pursuit of 
their lawful rights, therefore, the Impugned Amendments are liable to be struck 
down. Placed reliance upon Javed Jabbar v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 
2003 SC 955), Capt. Muhammad Ali Khan v. Federation of Pakistan through 
Secretary for Ministry of Maritime Affairs, Government of Pakistan Islamabad 
and 4 others (2025 PLC (C.S). 221), Muhammad Rafique v. Federation of 
Pakistan (PLD 2005 Lahore 150), Hanif Ahmed Bhatti v. Federation of 
Pakistan (PLD 2005 Karachi 364), Raja Amer Khan and others v. Federation 
of Pakistan through Secretary, Law and Justice Division, Ministry of Law and 
Justice, Islamabad and others (PLJ 2024 SC 114), Hirst v. the United 
Kingdom ([2005] ECHR 681/Application No.74025/01)

The rest of the learned counsels for the petitioners have adopted the 
arguments advanced by M/s. Hassan Abdullah Niazi and Ch. Ishtiaq Ahmad 
Khan, Advocates.  
8. 
While representing the Federation of Pakistan, Mirza Nasar Ahmad, 
learned Additional Attorney General for Pakistan commenced his submissions 
by arguing that the petitioners’ entire premise that the ‘Bar Councils’ are 
democratic bodies, is false; submits that the High Court Bar Associations or the 
Supreme Court Bar Association are essentially the democratic bodies but the 
Bar Councils in issue are not; for substantiating his arguments he has referred 
to entry 11, Part II of the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution to argue that 
legislative competence to legislate and to regulate the legal profession falls 
within the legislative competence and authority of the Federation; while 
explaining the trichotomy of constitutional structure and elaborating the 
authority and jurisdictional sphere of three organs of the State i.e. legislature, 
executive and judiciary, learned Additional Attorney General for Pakistan has 
referred to Articles 90, 97, 98 read with Article 137 of the Constitution and 
contends that the Bar Councils are only performing the delegated functions of 
regulating the legal profession as delegatee of the Federal Government; 
submits that the Federal Government can and has prescribed the eligibility 
threshold and qualifications for the members of the Bar Councils from time to 
time, therefore, per learned Additional Attorney Generals for Pakistan, the 
purported edifice that the Bar Councils being democratic institutions, evolving 
and existing through democratic process is flawed. He has submitted that 
though the Amendment Act was introduced as a private member bill but in 
terms of the constitutional mandate, as enumerated in his foregoing 
submissions, the irregularity, if any, has been cured by adoption of the bill 
through assent of the Federal Government in terms of clause (4) of Article 75 
of the Constitution. In order to dispel the core submission of discrimination, 
unreasonable classification without intelligible differentia, learned Additional 
Attorney General for Pakistan has argued that the submissions made by the 
learned counsels for the petitioners are misconceived when considered in the 
context of the mandate of the Provincial Bar Councils as these Bar Councils, 
by regulating the District and Tehsil Bar Bodies, are merely exercising the 
executive functions of the Federal Government. While concluding his  

W.P. No. 50969 of 2025 
 
Page 10 
 
submissions he argued that no vested right had come to vest in any of the 
petitioners or for that matter in any other aspirant who seeks to contest the 
upcoming elections as neither the schedule of the elections had been issued 
prior to the Impugned Amendments nor the scrutiny of candidates had taken 
place at the relevant juncture; while referring to the case of Muhammad 
Rafique1 supra, learned Additional Attorney General for Pakistan submits that 
the reliance placed on the said judgment is clearly misconceived as the cited 
precedent is not a precedent for the petitioners and rather operates as a binding 
precedent against the case sought to be argued by the petitioners; he has 
specifically referred to paragraphs Nos. 24 to 30 of the said judgment and 
submits that only a perfected right by acceptance of nomination papers after 
passing the test of scrutiny and challenges thereagainst, will crystalize into a 
right in favour of a candidate.  
9. 
Learned counsels for the Pakistan Bar Council, Punjab Bar Council as 
well as learned Assistant Advocate Generals, Punjab have adopted the 
arguments of the learned Additional Attorney General for Pakistan. While 
explaining the issuance of notice dated 04.07.2025 by the learned Returning 
Officer, learned Assistant Advocate General has argued that the Code of 
Conduct is a Standing Code, which remains in operation for entire term of the 
Bar Council.  
10. 
I have heard the learned counsels for the parties at full length, have 
minutely perused the available record as well as the relevant law on the subject. 
11. 
Since the vires of the law and rules are under question, therefore, it 
would be in the fitness of things to explicate the settled constitutional tests for 
successful invocation of the power of judicial review of this Court for laying a 
challenge to the vires of a law. This Court, while judicially reviewing the vires 
of the Impugned Amendments shall essentially be concerned with the 
constitutional validity of the Amendments. 
Jurisprudence viz the Scope of Constitutional Challenge to the vires of 
Law 
12. 
Before dealing with the challenge brought by the Petitioners, I have 
considered the constitutional touchstones for testing the vires of a statute. In 
                                                 
1 Muhammad Rafique v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2005 Lahore 150) 

W.P. No. 50969 of 2025 
 
Page 11 
 
the first place, as per settled jurisprudence, the power to strike down or declare 
void a legislative enactment, the jurisdiction must be exercised with great care 
and caution, in deference to the wisdom of the legislature. In the landmark 
judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan in Imrana Tiwana2 case, at para 
65, after discussing various cases from our jurisprudence as well as 
comparative jurisdictions, the Supreme Court of Pakistan has authoritatively 
gleaned the considerations, which must weigh heavy on the mind of this Court 
partaking such an exercise. The considerations are as follows: 
I. 
“There is a presumption in favour of constitutionality and a law 
must not be declared unconstitutional unless the statute is placed 
next to the Constitution and no way can be found in reconciling 
the two;  
II. 
Where more than one interpretation is possible, one of which 
would make the law valid and the other void, the Court must 
prefer the interpretation which favours validity; 
III. 
In determining the constitutional validity of measures or a 
provision therein, regard must be had to the real effect and impact 
thereof on the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution. 
IV. 
If a case can be decided on other or narrower grounds, the Court 
will abstain from deciding the constitutional question; 
V. 
The Court will not decide a larger constitutional question than is 
necessary for the determination of the case; 
VI. 
The Court will not declare a statute unconstitutional on the 
ground that it violates the spirit of the Constitution unless it also 
violates the letter of the Constitution; 
VII. 
The Court is not concerned with the wisdom or prudence of the 
legislation but only with its constitutionality; 
VIII. 
The Court will not strike down statutes on principles of republican 
or democratic government unless those principles are placed

Mala fides will not be attributed to the Legislature.” 
13. 
With the above parameters in mind, the constitutional yardsticks that 
have been developed in our jurisprudence by the Superior Courts are discussed 
and detailed below in ascertaining the veracity of the challenges raised by the 
Petitioners: 
A) 
Abridging of Fundamental Rights 
One of the main grounds for declaring a law void, or for striking it 
down, is that the law has the effect of abridging or taking away the 
fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution. As per Article 
8(2) of the Constitution, the Parliament cannot make any law(s) 
which takes away or abridges the fundamental rights conferred by 
Chapter 1 of Part II of the Constitution (Articles 9 – 28)3. 
B) 
Competence of the Legislature enacting the Law 
While substantive part of the law may be looked into by the Court 
to determine the vires of a statute, another ground for assessing the 
vires of law on procedural grounds is the competence of the 
legislature, enacting the law in question. The competence of the 
legislature is usually determined by the entries in the Federal 
Legislative List of the Constitution, and if a subject is found 
therein, then the competence to enact laws on that subject lies with 
the Federal Legislature. For subjects not enumerated in the Federal 
Legislative List, the power to enact laws on those subjects lies with 
the Provincial Legislatures. This is the scenario as it stands 
presently, following the omission of the Concurrent Legislative 
List by virtue of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution. The 
Supreme Court of Pakistan has enunciated the law on the subject 
through its landmark judgments in the cases of ‘Sui Southern Gas 
Company v Federation of Pakistan’ (2018 SCMR 802), and 
‘Province of East Pakistan v Siraj ul Haq Patwari’ (PLD 1966 SC 
854).

C) 
Legislation is colorable 
Another touchstone upon which the vires of a statute may be 
assessed is by determining whether the legislation is colorable. A 
colorable legislation is one where a legislature lacking legislative 
power or, subject to the Constitutional provision, may frame its 
legislation so as to make it appear to be within its legislative power 
or to be free from that constitutional prohibition. Such a law is 
colorable legislation, meaning thereby that while pretending to be a 
law in the exercise of undoubted power, it is in fact a law on a 
prohibited field4. 
D) 
Directly opposed to provisions of the Constitution 
Since the Constitution is the basic documents, governing the 
relationship between the State and the people, it is an accepted 
principle of constitutional jurisprudence that the Constitution is 
always treated to be higher than the other statutes, and whenever a 
statute enacted by the parliament is in conflict with the 
Constitution or is inconsistent therewith, to that extent, the same is 
liable to be struck down. Other than impinging upon the 
fundamental rights, statutes must also not violate the provisions of 
the Constitution guaranteeing the independence of judiciary and its 
separation from the executive. However, and as will be discussed 
below, certain provisions of the Constitution cannot be made basis 
to strike down statutes5.  
E) 
Possibility of two constructions and consequent conclusion 
Where the validity of a statute is impugned on the ground that its 
provisions contravene fundamental rights, two constructions are 
possible as to the meaning and intention of the legislature; the 
court should adopt that construction which upholds the validity6. 
A statute must never be declared unconstitutional unless its

of Pakistan” (PLD 2006 SC 697); “Mehram Ali v Federation of Pakistan” (PLD 1998 SC 1445).

invalidity is beyond reasonable doubt. A reasonable doubt must be 
resolved in favour of the statute being valid7; 
Grounds not susceptible for laying a challenge to the vires of law  
14. 
The Courts, while developing the jurisprudence on the judicial review of 
legislative enactments, and particularly in consideration of presumption of 
constitutional validity attached to the laws, have also settled the 
factors/grounds, which cannot and must not be looked at while determining the 
vires of the legislative instruments. Some of these factors are discussed below: 
A) 
Mala fides not attributable to the legislature 
As a general rule of thumb, the Supreme Court has consistently 
held that mala fide is not attributable to the legislature, and the 
same cannot be pleaded for assessing the vires of a statute. The 
bona fides of the legislature is presumed, as is the constitutionality 
of the law, and the purpose and object of the law is to be given 
weightage8.  
B) 
The law possibly or likely to be administered in a discriminatory 
manner is no ground to strike down the law: 
Where a law is not discriminatory ex facie but may be applied or 
administered in discriminatory manner, it cannot be challenged 
unless it is so administered and actually caused discrimination. The 
Petitioners in such situations shall have to demonstrate that the law 
has in fact been administered in a discriminatory manner9. 
C) 
Wisdom or Policy of the Legislature - not to be questioned 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan has held that it is not the function 
of the judiciary to legislate or to question the wisdom of the

legislature in making a law, and the wisdom or policy of the 
legislature is not open to question in the exercise of power of 
judicial review10.  
D) 
Reasonableness of law not to be looked at to determine its vires 
The reasonableness or otherwise of a law is a matter of legislative 
policy and it is not for the Court to adjudicate upon the same unless 
it has infringed any of the Fundamental Rights. Hence, the 
reasonableness of the law is not a touchstone for assessing the vires 
of a law11. In pronouncing on the constitutional validity of a 
statute, the Court is not concerned with the wisdom or unwisdom, 
the justice to injustice of the lawf. I that which is passed into law is 
within the scope of the power conferred on a legislature and 
violates no restrictions on that power, the law must be upheld 
whatever a Court may think of it.12 
15. 
Hence, the assertions of Petitioners and the challenges directed against 
the Impugned Amendments are to be considered in the light of the settled 
jurisprudence, as enumerated above, and consequently, the grounds, which do 
not meet these legal standards, are liable to be rejected. Accordingly, the merits 
of the challenges laid by Petitioners are discussed as under. 
Discrimination (Articles 25)  
16. 
The stance of the Petitioners is that the Impugned Amendments and their 
scope have ‘disparate impact’ or ‘adverse impact’ on the rights of large 
segment of lawyers. The Petitioners have argued that a separate ‘class of 
lawyers’ has been created and a preferential treatment has been given to them 
through the Impugned Amendments, hence, said provisions are discriminatory 
and thus offend Article 25 of the Constitution. The assertions of the Petitioners 
are grossly misconceived for the reason that neither any different right,

procedure, or standard have been prescribed, nor any different or separate 
treatment under the law has been meted out to them. The legislature has only 
prescribed a qualification as an eligibility threshold for the candidates who 
seek to contest the elections of the Provincial Bar Councils. Considering the 
scope and mandate of the Provincial Bar Councils, the in-house lawyers, 
academics, transactional lawyers etc. are not even regulated by the Provincial 
Bar Councils. The amended qualification of ten (10) years as an Advocate of 
High Court is in line with the earlier prescribed qualification of five (05) years. 
The question that as to what should be the touchstone and length of experience 
is purely a matter within the legislative competence of the legislature and its 
wisdom in bringing about this change cannot be questioned in view of the 
settled principles of law adumbrated above. The Impugned Amendment of 
Section 5A of the Act, 1973 is not discriminatory in nature by any means; 
instead, it is a simple enhancement of an already existing qualification. It is 
trite that reasonable classification is permissible and Article 25 of the 
Constitution is only attracted in an apple to apple comparison13. It is also well 
settled that although Article 25 of the Constitution envisages equality amongst 
citizens, it also allows for differential treatment of persons who are not 
similarly placed by virtue of a reasonable classification. However, to justify 
this difference in treatment, the reasonable classification needs to be 'based on 
intelligible differentia, which has a rational nexus with the object being sought 
to be achieved14. Likewise, it is vouched by the respectable authority that the 
persons may be classified in groups and such groups may be treated differently, 
if there is a reasonable classification15. In the instant case, the reasonable 
classification on the basis of one yard stick of experience of 10 years is quite 
evident from the Impugned Amendment of Section 5A of the Act, 1973. As 
regards the reasonableness of such classification, the reliance may be placed 
upon the well settled exposition of law that a statute or any enacting provision 
therein must be construed as to make it effective and operative. The Latin legal 
maxim "ut res magis valeat quam pereat" denotes that it is better for a thing to

have effect than to be made void or it is better to validate a thing than to 
invalidate it. The Court should, in so far as possible, avoid that construction 
which may ascribe or attribute unreasonableness to the will of legislature and 
while moving into the task of interpretation of any law or provision, the 
predominant objective should be that the law survives and the presumption, if 
any, must be in favour of its constitutionality. The Court should not adopt such 
interpretation which renders the statute or any of its provisions inoperative or 
unworkable16.  
17. 
Since much reliance has been placed upon the landmark judgments of 
the Supreme Court of Pakistan in Azizullah Memon17 and I.A. Sherwani18 cases 
for advancing the arguments for invocation of Article 25 of the Constitution by 
the petitioner side, therefore, it is appropriate to consider the said enunciations. 
As will be explicated below, I.A.Sherwani supra and many other authoritative 
judgments have extensively been considered by their Lordships while handing 
down the judgment in Azizullah Memon supra. Their Lordships, while 
discussing the true import of Article 25 of the Constitution have held:  
“The, equal protection clause was also considered in Zain Noorani v. Secretary of 
the National Assembly of Pakistan PLD 1957 Kar. 1. In Malik Muhammad Usman v. 
The State and another PLD 1965 Lah. 229 sections 8 and 11 of the Frontier Crimes 
Regulation providing for reference of proceedings to a Jirga were held to offend 
against Fundamental Right No. 15 of 1962 Constitution for the reason that the 
Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioner were given uncontrolled discretion to 
select particular cases and even particular accused in the same case for the 
discriminatory procedure which was not governed by any settled principle. The 
observations made in Jibendra Kishoreand Waris Meah were reiterated in East and 
West Steamship v. Pakistan (PLD 1958 SC 41) that "where a statute is not ex facie 
discriminatory but is capable of being administered in a discriminatory manner, the 
party challenging its constitutionality has to show that it has actually been 
administered in a discriminatory manner". Thus, where the statutory functionary 
acts mala fide or in a partial, unjust, oppressive or discriminatory manner, his 
action can be challenged for violation of equality clause of the Constitution. In F.B. 
Ali's case PLD 1975 SC 506 the challenge to amendments in Pakistan Army Act and

1993 SC 341)

Ordinance IV of 1967 was made inter alia as violative of equality clause of 1962 
Constitution. This Court repelled it on the basis of principles laid down in Waris 
Meah's case and observed that in this case if the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act 
had set up a Tribunal of exclusive jurisdiction, with a procedure different from the 
Code of Criminal Procedure, the challenge would not have succeeded as the 
offenders under the Foreign Exchange Regulation could validly and reasonably be 
considered a different class from the offenders under the ordinary law. Fauji 
Foundation's case PLD 1983 SC 457 ruled that legislation in regard to an individual 
can be made provided it is not discriminatory. In IA. Sherwani's case 1991 SCMR 
1041, after considering the judgments in F.B. Ali's case PLD 1975 SC 506, Abdul 
Wali Khan's case PLD 1976 SC 57, Aziz Begum's case PLD 1990 SC 899,-Shirin 
Munir and others v. Government of Punjab PLD 1990 SC 295 and several judgments 
of the Supreme Court of India, the following principles were deduced-  
"(i) 
that equal protection of law does not envisage that every citizen is to 
be treated alike in all circumstances, but it contemplates that persons 
similarly situated or similarly placed are to be treated alike;  
(ii) 
that reasonable classification is permissible but it must be founded on 
reasonable distinction or reasonable basis;  
(iii) 
that different laws can validly be enacted for different sexes, persons 
in different age group, persons having different financial standings, 
and persons accused of heinous crimes;  
(iv) 
that no standard of universal application to test reasonableness of a 
classification can be laid down as what may be reasonable 
classification in a particular set of circumstances, may be 
unreasonable in the other set of circumstances;  
(v) 
that a law applying to one person or one class of persons may be 
constitutionally valid if there is sufficient basis or reason for it, but a 
classification which is arbitrary and is not founded on any rational 
basis is no classification as to warrant its exclusion from the mischief 
of Article 25;  
(vi) 
that equal protection of law means that all persons equally placed be 
treated alike both in privileges conferred and liabilities imposed;  
(vii) 
that in order to make a classification reasonable, it should be 
based---  

W.P. No. 50969 of 2025 
 
Page 19 
 
(a) 
on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or 
things that are grouped together from those who have been 
left out;  
(b) 
that the differentia must have rational nexus to the object 
sought to be achieved by such classification." 
18. 
In a recent judgment passed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the 
case of Gul Zarif Khan and others v. Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 
through Chief Secretary, Peshawar and others (2025 SCMR 415), the 
principles of intelligible differentia and applicability thereof has been 
reaffirmed and it has been held that the persons may be classified into groups 
and such groups may be treated differently if there is reasonable basis for the 
difference. It has further been held that the principle of equality does not imply 
or connote that every law must have universal application to all classes of 
persons19.  
19. 
The above settled position of law viz the question of invocation of 
Article 25 of the Constitution, when juxtaposed with the facts and 
circumstances of the case in hand, leads to an ineluctable conclusion that no 
case of discrimination is made out and the Impugned Amendment in terms of 
changes brought about in Section 5A of the Act, 1973 is/are reasonable 
classification(s) based on intelligible differentia, therefore, this argument 
advanced by the petitioners has no force in law.  
 
Retrospective application & Claim of Vested Right 
VESTED RIGHT 
20. 
The second limb of arguments advanced by learned counsels for the 
petitioners is premised on their assumption that since the petitioners have a 
‘vested right’ to contest the upcoming Elections of the Provincial Bar Council, 
therefore, the Impugned Amendments, which have evidently not been brought 
about with retrospective operations, either expressly or through necessary 
intendment, are liable to be struck down or be deferred viz the elections, 2025 
for the reason that these amendments impinges upon the vested rights of the 
petitioners. As an alternate submission, it has vehemently been argued that the 
                                                 
19 Gul Zarif Khan and others v. Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through Chief Secretary, Peshawar and 
others (2025 SCMR 415) 

W.P. No. 50969 of 2025 
 
Page 20 
 
instant is a fit case for declaring that the Impugned Amendments, even if 
declared intra vires, will not be applicable for the upcoming elections of the 
Provincial Bar Councils. It has vociferously been contended by the learned 
counsels for the petitioners that since the tenure of Bar Council is definite by 
virtue of the provisions contained in the relevant statute and as a necessary 
corollary, the current year i.e. 2025 is election year, thus, considering the same 
the petitioners and many others alike have already campaigned extensively; 
they have attained the status of prospective candidates; the voters have 
announced their affiliations and aspirations for the candidates, therefore, any 
change in the threshold eligibility criteria, which tends to oust the 
potential/prospective candidates, cannot be applied to take away the vested 
rights of the petitioners and others. In a nub, it is argued by the petitioners that 
being potential candidates, not only the petitioners but also the voters have 
acquired a legitimate right of expectation for being treated in accordance with 
law, as it stood at the time of commencement of the election season.  
21. 
In order to appreciate such contentions in true perspective, this Court has 
considered as to what is the true import of the notions ‘legitimate expectation’, 
‘right’ or ‘vested right’.  
22. 
Doctrine of legitimate expectation is not part of any codified law rather 
the same had been coined and designed by the Courts primarily for the exercise 
of their power of judicial review of administrative actions. It only had nexus to 
administrative decisions and actions and no one can claim such a right against 
the legislature’s competence to legislate so long as the legislative competence 
is not in question. There can be no two views about the powers of legislature to 
legislate any law and to make it applicable prospectively or retrospectively or 
from any particular date, with clear/express intendment in this regard. However 
the procedural law, even though not expressly provided for, normally holds its 
applicability retrospectively as no one can claim vested right in the matter of 
procedure. There are number of precedents where the law has been so 
legislated or amended and made applicable retrospectively to destroy the 

W.P. No. 50969 of 2025 
 
Page 21 
 
vested rights of certain individuals and such actions, when challenged, have 
been upheld by the Courts, to be legal20.  
23. 
The term ‘vested right’ was interpreted by the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the case of Nabi Ahmad21 in the following terms: 
“29. 
What is a vested right? According to the Oxford English Dictionary, "vested" 
means "clothed, robed, dressed especially in ecclesiastical vestments, vested rights 
essentially differ from rights which are contingent, that is, completely created . . . 
vested interests may perhaps be defined as rights based not upon contract but upon 
custom". A close examination of these meanings and explanations reveals that 
vested right is free from contingencies, but not in the sense that it is exercisable 
anywhere and at any moment. There is hardly any right which can be so exercised. 
There must always be occasions at which and circumstances under which they may 
be exercised. Those occasions and circumstances do not constitute contingencies, 
but are the peculiar characteristics of those rights. For instance, the right to 
cross-examine (not to re-cross-examine) a witness is a vested right, although the 
occasion for exercising it arises only if the witness says or has said something 
unfavourable and often after his examination-in-chief is over. The occasion to 
cross-examine may not arise or may not be exercised-but the right is not to be 
denied. The following discussion of the connotations of "vested rights" by J. G. 
Sutherland in his book on "Statutes and Statutory Construction," Vol. 2, Art. 2205, is 
helpful in clarifying the above thought: - 
"It is impossible to assign precise meaning to the term (vested right) for any 
attempt results only in conflict in the decisions. By `vested right' can be 
meant no more than those rights which under particular circumstances will 
be protected from legislative interference (unless it is clearly intended). But 
as it is a right which vests upon equities, it has reasonable limits and 
restrictions : it must have some regard to the general welfare and public 
policy, it is not a right which is to be examined, settled and depended on a 
distinct and separate consideration of the individual case, but rather on 
broad and general grounds which embrace the welfare of the whole 
community and which seek the equal- and impartial protection of the interest 
of all."

24. 
In the context of Petitioners’ line of arguments, the interpretation of the 
term ‘vested right’, as enunciated by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the 
landmark judgment of Mian Rafi-ud-Din22 is particularly instructive and 
authoritative. The relevant portion of the said judgment is reproduced herein 
below: 
“A `vested right', an `accrued right' or a `substantive right' does not mean only title 
to property or office; a right, benefit or an advantage conferred by a statute, if 
availed of by doing a thing as required by the statute, is also a right of this kind. 
Again, if a right, benefit or advantage conferred by a statute is dependent on the 
happening of a contingency, then, the same becomes a `vested or accrued right' after 
the contingency -has, happened. This can be illustrated by giving some instances. 
For example, a co-sharer's statutory right to pre-empt the land transferred by 
another co-sharer out of the common holding- is a substantive right; this right of 
pre-emption is the co-sharer's 'vested right' and is capable of being enforced. After 
the Court has granted pre-emption, the pre-emptor again acquires a `vested right' in 
the land itself. Similarly, a mortgagor's right to redeem a mortgage is a `vested right' 
and is enforceable. Again, a lessor has a right under section 106 of the Transfer of 
Property Act to determine a monthly tenancy in respect of an urban property by 15 
day's notice to quit. This right conferred by the statute is to be availed of by giving 
such a notice. After such a notice has been given, the lessor acquires a substantive 
right to eject the lessee and to get possession of the demised premises. This is the 
lessor's `vested right'. If the lessee does not quit pursuant to the notice, the lessor is 
entitled under the law to recover compensation from the lessee for the unauthorised 
use and occupation of the premises. The right to recover compensation is yet another 
substantive right. If the lessor has obtained a decree for compensation in a suit 
brought for the purpose, then, the decree so obtained by him becomes a property and 
his right thereto is his `vested right'.” 
 
Rights are vested when the right to enjoyment, present or prospective, 
has become the property of some particular person or persons as a present 
interest. A vested right is a title to the present or future enjoyment of property, 
or to the present or future enforcement of a demand or a legal exemption from 
a demand by another. The right must be immediate, absolute, complete, 
unconditional and independent of a contingency. Accordingly, a mere 
expectancy of future benefit or a contingent interest founded on the anticipated 
continuance of existing laws, does not constitute a vested right. Inchoate rights,

which have not been acted upon, are not vested rights. Moreover, a vested right 
may not arise at a time when there is no possibility of enforcing a claim under 
the existing law23. In certain cases, a distinction is drawn between an existing 
right and a vested right and it is said that the rule against retrospective 
construction is applied only to save vested rights and not existing rights24. The 
distinction between what is, and what is not a right preserved by the provisions 
of section 6 of General Clauses Act, 1897 is often one of great fineness. What 
is unaffected by the repeal of a statute is a right acquired or accrued under it 
and not a mere "hope or expectation of”, or liberty to apply for, acquiring a 
right. A distinction is drawn between a legal proceeding for enforcing a right 
acquired or accrued and a legal proceeding for acquisition of a right. The 
former is saved whereas the latter is not25. The expression ‘vested right’ means 
an absolute or indefeasible right. The claim based on the vested right or settled 
expectation to obtain sanction cannot be set up against statutory provisions. It 
is a right which cannot be taken away without the consent of the owner. Such 
rights may arise from contract or statute and from the operation of law26. The 
right to take advantage of a statute cannot be held to be a vested right27. 
25. 
Applying the above test, the rights claimed by the petitioners may have 
become vested rights being enforceable under the law once such rights were 
perfected by virtue of acceptance of nomination papers of the candidate(s) or at 
least when the election schedule was notified. Mere claim of ‘campaign’ for 
upcoming election does not transform a mere expectancy into a ‘vested right’ 
in any manner. Applying this analogy would lead to an absurd outcome of 
destroying the legislature’s authority to legislate/amend the law at any time 
since any person can rise and claim, immediately after the swearing in of the 
Provincial Bar Council(s) that he has worked substantially for contesting the 
next elections, therefore, vested rights had come to vest in him and any change 
in law would be detrimental to such ‘vested right’. The rule against 
retrospective construction is not applicable to a statute merely “because a part 
of the requisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing”. If

that were not so, every statute will be presumed to apply only to persons born 
and things come into existence after its operation and such interpretation may 
well result in virtual nullification of most of the statutes. An amending Act is, 
therefore, not retrospective merely because it applies also to those to whom the 
pre-amended Act was applicable if the amended Act has operation from the 
date of its amendment and not from an anterior date. But this does not mean 
that a statute which takes away or impairs any vested right acquired under 
existing laws or which creates a new obligation or imposes a new burden in 
respect of past transactions, will not be treated as retrospective28.  
RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION 
26. 
There is no distinction between a retrospective legislation which affects 
rights and liabilities and that which does not do so. All legislations affect rights 
or liabilities; the words being used in their widest sense. Legislature either 
creates a right or takes away a right or restricts or enlarges a right or similarly 
affects liabilities29. A statute is to be deemed to be retrospective, which takes 
away or impairs any vested right acquired under existing laws, or creates a new 
obligation, or imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability in respect of 
transactions or considerations already past30. According to this definition, the 
very meaning of a retrospective legislation is one that impairs any vested right 
or imposes a new obligation in relation to transactions already past. 
Retrospective is well defined: “Nova constitutio futuris formam imponere 
bebet, non prateritis” i.e. unless there be clear words to the contrary, statutes 
do not apply to a past, but to a future, state of circumstances31. During the 
course of arguments, the petitioners have continuously referred to case law that 
just states the said general rule against retrospectivity; they have tried to carve 
out a situation or exception for themselves by trying to fit themselves in the 
category of prospective candidates and relied on the argument of ‘Election 
Year’, which term is alien to the scheme of law, whereas, the term ‘Election’ 
though has not been defined under the Act, 1973 or Rules, 1976 but the resort

may be had to its authoritative interpretation by the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
in Javed Hashmi’s case32 wherein it has been held that the word ‘Election” 
connotes a very wide sense; in its wide sense, the process of conducting the 
election starts with the issuance of the election program and stands completed 
on the publication of the names of the returned candidates in the official 
gazette. Thus, these arguments have no legal legs to stand upon in the case in 
hand as none of the petitioners have been able to establish nor have 
successfully referred to the fact(s) as to how the Impugned Amendments have 
any retrospective application qua any ‘vested rights’ as discussed and defined 
above.  
27. 
The term ‘Retrospective’ is somewhat ambiguous and that good deal of 
confusion has been caused by the fact that it is used in more senses than one. In 
general, however, the Courts regard a statute as retrospective, which operates 
on cases of facts that it affects, even if for the future only, the character or 
consequences of transaction previously entered into or of other past conduct. 
While considering the question of whether a statute has retrospective operation, 
the nature of the right affected needs to be first considered. Where there is a 
vested right, an amendment will be considered prospective so as to not to affect 
the vested right33.  "Literally defined, a retrospective law is a law that looks 
backward or on things that are past; and a retroactive law is one that acts on 
things that are past: and in this common use, as applied to statutes, the two 
words are synonymous, and in this connection may broadly be defined as 
having reference to state of things existing before the Act in question. A 
retroactive or retrospective law, in the legal sense, is one that takes away or 
impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws or creates a new obligation, 
imposes a new duty or attaches a new disability in respect to transactions or 
considerations already past34.  
PAST AND CLOSED TRANSACTION 
28. 
The petitioners have also sought to argue the ground of past and closed 
transaction on the notion that since the election year has commenced and the

elections were in the offing, therefore, the rights of the prospective/potential 
candidates are protected on the notion of ‘past and closed transaction’ with 
regard to the Impugned Amendments. It will be seen that the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan has extensively expounded the law on the subject while interpreting 
the notions of ‘vested rights’ & ‘past and closed transactions’; some of these 
pronouncements e.g. Al-Samrez Enterprise35 & Mekotex36, have also been 
relied upon by the petitioners. A detailed analysis of the distinction between 
the two need not to detain this argument any further; it suffices to note that 
while every past and closed transaction is normally based on or comprises of a 
vested right, every vested right is not necessarily a past and closed transaction. 
Indeed, if rights were required to be placed in ascending order, the 'scale' could 
be said to comprise of a 'bare' right, a ‘vested right’ and a ‘past and closed 
transaction’. Ordinarily, a right can be regarded as progressing from a 'bare' 
right to become a ‘vested right’ and then perhaps even a ‘past and closed 
transaction’. Of course, some rights only become vested rights, and do not go 
beyond to become past and closed transactions. Others may vest immediately, 
as soon as they arise or accrue, and then may (or may not) become past and 
closed transactions. Some rights (in rare and unusual situations) may even 
become past and closed transactions once they accrue, i.e., progress to that 
category straight from being 'bare' rights. As even this brief account shows, 
some care must be taken to properly analyze the nature of the right under 
consideration. This is clearly established by the decision in Molasses 
Trading37. The case was concerned with the grant of an exemption under the 
Customs Act, 1969. An exemption (which was granted by a notification issued 
under section 19 of the Act) can be regarded as a 'bare' right, one that can be 
availed of by the concerned importer. In the well-known case of Al-Samrez 
Enterprise supra, it was held that if the importer altered his position in reliance 
on the notification (e.g. by entering into a contract or opening a letter of credit), 
he acquired a vested right in the exemption, to which he remained entitled even 
if the exemption itself stood withdrawn by the time the goods arrived in 
Pakistan. The 'bare' right, in other words, had been transformed into a vested

right. In order to undo the effect of this decision, Section 31A was added to the 
Customs Act, 1969 (by the Finance Act, 1988), and it was deemed always to 
have been part of the said Act. The question before the Supreme Court in 
Molasses Trading supra was whether section 31A had retrospectively 
destroyed the vested rights recognized in Al Samrez (the goods in question 
having been imported before 01.07.1988). The Supreme Court unanimously 
held that the answer to this question was in the affirmative. However, by a 
majority, it was also held that those cases in which the bills of entry had been 
filed by or before 30.06.1988 (i.e. before the Finance Act, 1988 came into 
force) had become past and closed transactions, and Section 31A did not apply 
to them, notwithstanding the absolute terms in which it had, ostensibly, been 
given retrospective effect. The reason why the rights in those cases had gone 
from being vested rights to become past and closed transactions was that, in 
respect of customs duties, the levy of the tax stood crystallized on the date on 
which the bill of entry was filed. It is well-settled that retrospective statutes 
affecting vested rights and/or past and closed transactions are to be given the 
narrowest effect and interpretation that is reasonably possible. Section 31-A, 
being concerned with undoing the effect of the Al Samrez case, was directed 
towards vested rights, and could not, therefore, affect past and closed 
transactions. Molasses Trading thus nicely illustrates both how rights can move 
along the 'scale' referred to above, and the distinction that exists between 
vested rights and past and closed transactions. If the ratio of Molasses, Al-
Samrez and Mekotex judgments are applied to the case of the petitioners, the 
petitioners did not even have a prospective right at the time when the 
Impugned Amendments were brought about. Since neither the election 
schedule was announced nor the stage for filing of the nomination papers had 
come to pass, therefore, the reliance on Muhammad Rafique’s judgment may 
rather be placed against the contentions of the petitioners. The relevant 
paragraph of Muhammad Rafique’s case would clinch the entire issue as the 
said binding precedent of a Full Bench of this Court not only settles that at 
what stage candidates right becomes a vested/perfected right in an election but 
also settles that right to contest the election of the nature in hand is not a 
fundamental right guaranteed under Article 17 of the Constitution. The same 
judgment also sets at naught the inaptness of reliance placed by the petitioner 

W.P. No. 50969 of 2025

on Javed Jabbar’s case. Following paragraphs of Muhammad Rafique supra 
are reproduced herein below: 
“24. 
As far as the plea based on infraction of Articles 17 and 25 of the 
Constitution is concerned, it will be necessary to first examine the nature of the right 
to elect and to be elected to the Punjab Bar Council. The petitioners have 
vehemently relied on the observations in the case of Javed Jabbar supra that right 
to contest an election is a fundamental right. These observations were made in 
connection with election to the Pakistan Senate and the basis was sub-Article 2 of 
Article 17 of the Constitution whereby every citizen, not being in the service of 
Pakistan, shall have the right to form or be a member of a political party and that 
right to be a member of a political party includes right to contest an election. 
Elections to the Parliament are rooted in a number of provisions of the 
Constitution such as Articles 50, 59, 62, 63, 63-A, 218, 222, 224 and 226. However, 
it may be observed that Article 17 of the Constitution does not contemplate that 
right to contest an election to a statutory body created by the statute itself will be a 
fundamental right. . . . . . . . .  
. . . . . . . . .  
26. 
The nature of the right to elect came under consideration of Supreme Court 
of India in Jyoti Basu and others v. Debi Ghosal and others (AIR 1982 SC 983) and 
the following observations were made:- 
"A right to elect fundamental though it is to democracy, is anomalously 
enough, neither a fundamental right nor a Common Law Right. It is pure and 
simple, a statutory right. So is the right to be elected. So is the right to 
dispute an election. Outside of statute, there is no right to elect, no right to be 
elected and no right to dispute an election. Statutory creations they are, and 
therefore, subject to statutory limitation. " 
27. 
The Bar Councils are the creation of the statute and right to elect or to be 
elected is the creation of the statute. Article 17 of the Constitution does not refer to a 
statutory right to elect or to be elected: Therefore, the right to elect and to be elected 
to the Bar Councils being a creation of the statute, could be lawfully regulated by the 
statute. A salient feature of this case is that the impugned Ordinance was 
promulgated on the` basis of the recommendations of the Pakistan Bar Council 
which is duly represented by the Provincial Bar Councils. Therefore, the impugned 
amending Ordinance is not violative of Article 17 of the Constitution. 
28. 
As far as the plea of discrimination is concerned, enhancement of the 
qualifications as an Advocate of this Court and the standing from 7 to 10 years only 
regulates the right to be elected. The qualifications were laid down by Act XXXV of 

W.P. No. 50969 of 2025 
 
Page 29 
 
1973 and could, therefore be lawfully altered by the Legislature. Likewise, the 
electorate had no vested right to the number of seats for which election to the Punjab 
Bar Council is to be held. Therefore, the amending Ordinance is not ultra vires of 
Article 25 of the Constitution. Reference to the election to the N.-W.F.P. Bar Council 
under the old law is out of place as the impugned Ordinance could not be struck 
down on this ground. 
29. 
As far as the petitioners in the first seven cases are concerned the question 
left to be determined is whether the amended section 5-A enhancing the qualification 
from 7 to 10 years standing could be applied to them so as to give retrospective 
effect to the impugned Ordinance. Our answer to this question is in the negative for 
the reasons to follow. 
30. 
The revised schedule issued on 6-11-2004 by the learned Returning Officer 
had the effect of nullifying the valid nominations of the said petitioners. The 
amendment made by Ordinance No.III of 2004 have become part of the Act itself 
but even in the scheme of the entire aforesaid Act there is no provision for 
nullifying a valid nomination already made Right to be elected is the creation of 
Act No.XXXV of 1973 and as a result of acceptance of the nomination papers and 
publication of the list of the contesting candidates, the right of the said petitioners 
to contest the election stood perfected and that right could not be taken away 
except by express words or unequivocal intendment of the legislature which we 
were unable to find in section 1(3) of amending Ordinance . . . . . . . .  
[Emphasis Supplied] 
29. 
The above clearly settles that the overwhelming reliance by the learned 
counsels for the petitioners on the cases Javed Jabbar38, Muhammad Nasir 
Mehmood39 & Muhammad Rafiq40 supra is entirely misconceived in the 
peculiar facts and circumstances of the instant case. Considering the foregoing 
and in view of the settled law on the subject that a case is only authority for 
what it actually decides and cannot be cited as precedent for a proposition that 
may be inferred from it41, the case law relied upon by the learned counsels for 
the petitioners is distinguishable in facts and circumstances of the case in hand

and would therefore, have no precipitable relevance to the instant case to the 
extent of the amendments brought about in the Act, 1973 and Rules, 1976. 
30. 
Adverting to the argument of democratic norms and essence viz the 
elections in question, there is much force in the argument advanced by the 
learned Additional Attorney General for Pakistan on the touchstone of Article 
97 of the Constitution. It is unequivocal that Article 97, when read with Entry 
11, Part II of the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution, clothes the Federal 
Government with twin powers and authority i.e. the legislative competence and 
the executive authority qua the same subject. It quite evidently flows from the 
same that Bar Councils created and functioning under the Act, 1973 and the 
Rules, 1976, be it Pakistan Bar Council or Provincial Bar Councils, are 
performing delegated authority of the Federation to regulate the profession of 
law. Article 97 of the Constitution clearly purports that the power and authority 
to legislate viz a particular subject matter, comes within the executive authority 
of the federation qua the same subject. However, since the cases in hand may 
be decided on the other narrower grounds, this Court, though tempted enough 
to ponder further, is not inclined to burden this judgment with more on this 
issue as this question will be elaborately answered in some other appropriate 
case, where decision of the case requires such necessary enunciation.  
31. 
For what has been discussed above, the challenge laid to the vires of the 
amendments brought about in the Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils Act, 
1973, by virtue of the Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils (Amendment) Act, 
2025 is dismissed and the impugned amendments thereof are declared intra 
vires. 
32. 
The alternate prayer seeking declaration that the amended provisions are 
retrospective in nature, therefore, the same may not be implemented for the 
upcoming elections of the Provincial Bar Council(s) is also dismissed being 
misconceived.  
33. 
Adverting to the submissions of the learned counsels for the petitioners 
qua the Amended Rules, I have minutely perused the Impugned Rules in view 
of the above settled principles of interpretation and determination of vires. 
Needless to observe that the Rules, 1976 have been framed while exercising 
delegated authority, therefore, different criteria applies to the questions of 

W.P. No. 50969 of 2025 
 
Page 31 
 
determination of the vires of delegated legislation when compared with the test 
of statute itself, out of which such delegated rule making power had flown. 
Delegated legislation is secondary legislation – it is a law made by a person or 
body other than the legislature but with legislature’s authority. In a recent 
judgment, Shams Mehmood Mirza J.; has authoritatively enunciated the subject 
while comprehensively considering the settled principles of law in this respect; 
his Lordship has enumerated the tests determining the vires of delegated 
legislation. The relevant paragraphs of the law report42 are reproduced below: 
8. 
The Courts have spelt out a number of grounds for laying a challenge to 
delegated or subordinate legislation. The following tests have been laid down by the 
Courts for making a vires determination of the delegated legislation. 
(1) 
Whether the Rules framed are beyond the power granted by the 
enabling legislation (ultra vires); 
(2) 
Whether the process for formulating the Rules prescribed by the 
parent statute was followed (procedural ultra vires); and  
(3) 
Are the impugned Rules consistent with the objective of the parent 
statute.  
 
These tests are also propounded in judgments reported as Muhammad Amin 
etc v. Government of Pakistan 2015 SCMR 630, Khawaja Ahamd Hassan v. 
Province of Punjab 2015 SCMR 186 and Aziz Ahmad v. Provincial Police Officer 
PLD 2005 Lahore 185. 
9. 
It is axiomatic that if the provisions of a statute deal with the subject matter 
in considerable detail, the scope of delegated legislation shall correspondingly 
become limited. On the contrary, if the statute generally deals with the subject 
matter, the scope of delegated legislation made under it shall become greater for it is 
assumed that the legislature consciously decided to leave the detail to be filled out by 
delegated legislation [see Muhammad Fahad Malik v. Pakistan Medical and Dental 
Council etc PLD 2018 Lahore 75 and Morton v Union Steamship Co of New Zealand 
Ltd (1951) 83]. The need for delegated legislation arises to reduce pressure on 
parliamentary time and to make provision for rapidly changing or uncertain 
situations which may or may not be in the contemplation of the Parliament. The 
theory underlying the principle of delegated legislation is that the Parliament is only 
concerned with general principles whereas the executive and other authorities 
authorized to make delegated legislation address and deal with matters of 
                                                 
42 “Jamil Sweets v. Federation of Pakistan” (2020 PTD 752 = 2020 LHC 617)

administration and detail. O'Connor J. in the decision in Baxter v Ah Way (1909) 8 
CLR 626 put forward the rationale for making regulations in the following terms: 
Now the legislature would be an ineffective instrument for making laws if it 
only dealt with the circumstances existing at the date of the measure. The aim 
of all legislatures is to project their minds as far as possible into the future, 
and to provide in terms as general as possible for all contingencies likely to 
arise in the application of the law. But it is not possible to provide 
specifically for all cases, and, therefore, legislation from the very earliest 
times, and particularly in more modern times, has taken the form of 
conditional legislation, leaving it to some specified authority to determine the 
circumstances in which the law shall be applied, or to what its operation 
shall be extended, or the particular class of persons or goods to which it shall 
be applied. 
 
It is furthermore settled law that grant of power of legislation includes the 
power to enact incidental or ancillary legislation which power is inherent in the 
Constitution. It was observed in Edward Mills Co., Ltd., Beawar v. State of Ajmer, 
(S) AIR 1955 SC 25 "…….it is a fundamental principle of constitutional law that 
everything necessary to the exercise of a power is included in the grant of the power. 
A legislature cannot strip itself of its essential functions and vest the same on an 
extraneous authority. The primary duty of law making has to be discharged by the 
legislature itself but delegation may be resorted to as a subsidiary or an ancillary 
measure." Similarly, in Vasan-lal Maganbhai v. State of Bombay 1961-1 SCR 341, it 
was held as under: 
It is now well established by the decisions of this Court that the power of 
delegation is a constituent element of the legislative power as a whole, and 
that in modern times when the legislatures enact laws to meet the challenge 
of the complex socio-economic problems, they often find it convenient and 
necessary to delegate subsidiary or ancillary powers to delegates of their 
choice for carrying out the policy laid down by their Acts. 
10. 
A survey of the judgment would show that the following principles for 
interpretation of delegated legislation have been laid down. There is a presumption 
of validity attached to the delegated legislation. The Rules made under a statutory 
mandate ought to be read and interpreted in a broad manner which makes them 
consistent to the parent statute. The Court holding the inquiry does not indulge in 
assessing the policy merits of the Rules or makes assessment as to whether the Rules 
would meet the objectives set out by the parent statute. The powers delegated to the 
Authority for framing Rules generally signify broad discretion reserved for it to 
make assessment as to what will advance the purposes of the parent statute and also 

W.P. No. 50969 of 2025 
 
Page 33 
 
the measures required to advance those purposes. It is generally recognized that 
issues which depend on policy matters involve greater expertise and are thus left to 
be determined by the delegated agencies. Implicit in this deferential attitude is the 
acknowledgement that the Courts do not possess policy expertise on such legislation 
absent the lack of resources to engage in policy analysis for lack of capacity.” 
34. 
While applying the above test, it is evident that the condition of 
“continuous practice for five preceding years in such district”, now sought to 
be imposed through Impugned Notification, clearly amounts to contradicting, 
overriding & enlarging the scope of statutory provision as provided under 
Section 5A(d) of the Act, 1973, which imposes a condition that a candidate 
simply needs to be a voter member of Bar Association falling in such district 
for a period of not less than five (05) years. Similarly, the amended clause (a) 
of Rule 175-K and newly inserted clause (a1) of Rule 175-K of the Rules, 1976 
are also not in conformity with the definition of a voter, as couched in Section 
2(o) of the Act, 1973. It is well settled that the rules made under an Act or 
Statute are subservient to the parent Act and such rules cannot contradict, 
override, add to the clear provision of the parent Statute. It is equally well 
settled that any rule which is inconsistent or travels beyond the scope of parent 
statute, is ultra vires the parent statute. As per the settled cannons of 
interpretation of statutes, the rules made under a parent statute cannot go 
beyond the scope of said statute nor can they enlarge the scope of statutory 
provisions therein as the power of rule-making is an incidental power that must 
follow and not run parallel to the parent statute43. In view of the above, the 
amendments brought about through the Impugned Notification in Rules 6 (1), 
clause (a) to Rule 175-K and clause (a1) to Rule 175-K of the Rules, 1976 are 
hereby declared ultra vires. 
35.

Officer/Advocate General is in violation of settled jurisprudence as well as the 
very essence of the Act, 1973, which provides for a judicial oversight in the 
matters which pertain to and are related with the remedy of aggrieved persons. 
The concept of judicial oversight is well settled in our jurisprudence44. In the 
instant case, the remedy of appeal being provided before the Attorney General 
against the decision of Advocate General lacks the element of judicial 
oversight, therefore, sub-rule (5) substituted Rule 10-B of Rules, 1976 is 
hereby declared ultra vires and the matter is referred to the Pakistan Bar 
Council for reconsidering the same by providing a remedy, which may have 
some judicial oversight. This Court is sanguine that while doing so, the learned 
Members of the Pakistan Bar Council will consider the provisions contained in 
the Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils Act, 1973, particularly Section 42 (2) 
thereof.  
36. 
Having reached the culmination of this judgment, I deem it befitting to 
acknowledge the invaluable assistance rendered by the learned counsels as well 
as learned law officers, whose able submissions, conduct and consistent 
adherence to decorum have significantly enriched the proceedings of this 
Court. 
 
The above are the detailed reasons for my following short order of even 
date i.e. 02.10.2025: 
 
“For reasons to be recorded in my detailed judgment to follow, this 
and connected petitions are decided in the following terms: 
i. 
The challenge laid to the vires of the amendments brought about 
in the Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils Act, 1973, by virtue 
of the Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils (Amendment) Act, 
2025 is dismissed and as a natural corollary, the impugned 
amendments thereof are declared intra vires; 
ii. 
The alternate prayer of the petitioners, seeking a declaration 
that the amended provisions are retrospective in nature, 
therefore, the same may not be implemented for the upcoming

being misconceived; 
iii.

so, the learned Members of the Pakistan Bar Council will 
consider the provisions contained in the Legal Practitioners and
