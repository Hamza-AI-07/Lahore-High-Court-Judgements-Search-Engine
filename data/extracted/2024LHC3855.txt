MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.- Through 
instant revision petition, petitioner has assailed the vires of judgments 
& decrees dated 30.09.2011 & 30.05.2014, passed by learned Civil 
Judge and Additional District Judge, Rawalpindi, respectively, 
whereby suit for declaration along with permanent injunction, filed by 
petitioner, was concurrently dismissed.  
2. 
Facts in brief are that petitioner instituted a suit for declaration 
along with permanent injunction against the respondent to the effect 
that he is owner-in-possession of land measuring 04-Kanal 11-Marla 
bearing Khasra No.132 situated in the revenue estate of Hanaser, 
Tehsil Kahuta, District Rawalpindi, in terms of registered sale deed 
No.346 dated 27.09.1975 and mutation No.603 attested on 08.11.1975; 
and that orders dated 09.10.1990 and 20.11.1990, passed by 
respondent, be declared illegal, void and ineffective qua the rights of 
petitioner with regard to the suit land. The suit was contested by the 
respondent by filing written statement. Learned Trial Court after 
framing issues, recording evidence and hearing arguments of learned 

 
2 
C.R. No.991-D of 2014 
 
counsel for the parties, proceeded to dismiss the suit vide judgment & 
decree dated 30.09.2011. Feeling aggrieved, petitioner filed appeal 
before learned Additional District Judge, who vide judgment & decree 
30.5.2014 dismissed the same. Hence, this revision petition.  
3. 
Learned counsel for petitioner submits that petitioner is a bona 
fide purchaser of the disputed land, but mutation was cancelled without 
issuance of any notice, rather without holding any inquiry and 
affording opportunity of hearing to the petitioner. He further submits 
that the Provincial Government was not competent to cancel allotment 
granted by the Central Government. He adds that the registered sale 
deed of the property is still intact. He argues that after repeal of the 
Evacuee Laws in the year 1975, past and closed transactions could not 
be re-opened by the respondent. In support, he relied upon Khawaja 
Bashir Ahmad v. The Additional Settlement Commissioner, Rawalpindi 
and others (1991 SCMR 1604). 
4. 
On the other hand, learned Law Officer defends the impugned 
judgments & decrees. 
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused.  
6. 
Record shows that the allotment was initially made in favour of 
one Faiz Muhammad s/o Muhammad Alam vide mutation No.398 
dated 06.01.1973. Subsequently, the disputed property was sold to 
Muhammad Iqbal vide mutation No.399. Later, the disputed property 
was further alienated in favour of Capt. Ghulam Muhammad vide 
registered sale deed No.86 dated 25.06.1973 and mutation No.481 
dated 16.11.1973. Finally, through registered sale deed No.346 dated 
27.9.1975 and mutation No.603 attested on 08.11.1975, the petitioner 
purchased the disputed property from said Capt. Ghulam Muhammad. 
During the proceedings before the revenue authorities, it was 
established that Faiz Muhammad’s claim was bogus, leading to the 
cancellation of his  mutation vide order dated 09.10.1990 and 
subsequent transfer in favour of the respondent vide mutation No.975 
dated 20.11.1990.  
7. 
Admittedly the Displaced Persons (Land Settlement) Act, 
1958 was repealed by the Displaced Persons Laws (Repeal) Act, 

 
3 
C.R. No.991-D of 2014 
 
1975 whereafter no new allotment could be made by the Notified 
Officer / Chief Settlement Commissioner. However, if any earlier 
allotment of evacuee land was obtained fraudulently, the authority 
possesses inherent powers to investigate such fraudulent allotments 
as fraudulent allotments lack legal sanctity. Under Section 10 of the 
Displaced Persons (Land Settlement) Act, 1958, the Chief 
Settlement Commissioner has the jurisdiction to adjudicate or 
investigate the legitimacy of evacuee claims and if, fraud is found in 
the allotment process, can reverse the allotment order. The 
jurisdiction of the Chief Settlement Commissioner / Notified Officer 
in this regard has been affirmed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in a judgment reported as Messrs Beach Luxury Hotels, 
Karachi v. Messrs Anas Muneer Ltd. and others (2016 SCMR 222) 
wherein it is observed that when an allotment matter is re-opened, 
the Settlement Authority has the jurisdiction to re-examine all the 
facts related to the title of the parties from the inception of claim and 
to decide the matter according to available record and applicable 
law. Reliance is placed upon Sheikh Rauf Ahmad v. Dr. Nazir Saeed, 
Member (Judicial-V), Board of Revenue (2020 YLR Note 52).  
8. 
The main contention of petitioner is that, following the repeal of 
Evacuee Laws in the year 1975, transaction in favour of Faiz 
Muhammad executed in the year 1973 could not be re-opened. 
However, it must be noted that transaction in favour of Faiz 
Muhammad has been proven to be bogus and fraudulent. Therefore, 
the protection of being a past and closed transaction does not apply to 
such fraudulent transactions. These transactions are subject to review 
by the competent authorities and the constitutional jurisdiction of this 
Court cannot be invoked to shield verification orders for claims 
obtained through fraud. It is well settled that fraud undermines even 
the most solemn proceedings, and any structure based on such 
fraudulent transactions, stands automatically dismantled and any ill-
gotten gains achieved by fraudster cannot be validated under any 
norms of law and any benefit/order obtained through fraud, 
misrepresentation of true facts cannot assume the status of past and 

 
4 
C.R. No.991-D of 2014 
 
closed transaction and that illegal orders always remain vulnerable to 
the legal proceedings of investigation. Reliance is placed upon Nawab 
Syed Raunaq Ali etc. v. Chief Settlement Commissioner and others 
(PLD 1973 Supreme Court 236), Qutubuddin and others v. Sardar 
Hidayat Ullah Khan Mokal and another (1976 SCMR 524), Lahore 
Development Authority v. Firdous Steel Mills (Pvt.) Limited (2010 
SCMR 1097) and Sindh Irrigation and Drainage Authority v. 
Government of Sindh and others (2022 SCMR 595).  
 
Even the petitioner has failed to show that initial allotment was 
genuine and not fraudulent, therefore, the contention of petitioner that 
he was not associated while cancelling mutation passed in his favour, 
is misconceived on the sole principle that fraud vitiates even the most 
solemn proceedings.  
9. 
Needless to say that the preponderance of judicial authority is in 
favour of conceding such a power to every authority, Tribunal or Court 
to suo moto recall or review an order obtained through fraud. This is 
based on the general principle that fraud vitiates even the most solemn 
proceedings, and no party should be allowed to take advantage of their 
fraud. There is no rational basis for discriminating between the powers 
available in this behalf to a Court of general jurisdiction and those 
available to a Court or Tribunal of special or limited jurisdiction, as the 
impact of fraud is the same in either case. The responsibility to address 
and rectify the effects of fraud lies with the authority before which the 
fraud was perpetrated. Even a Tribunal with limited or special 
jurisdiction has the power to suo moto recall or review an order 
obtained by fraud. Reliance is placed upon The Chief Settlement 
Commissioner, Lahore v. Raja Mohammad Fazil Khan and others 
(PLD 1975 Supreme Court 331). 
10. 
It would be relevant to observe here that when a basic order / 
transaction is void ab initio, the entire series of subsequent orders / 
transactions, together with the superstructure of rights and obligations 
built upon them, must fall to the ground because such orders have a 
little foundation as the same are based on void order, unless some 
statute or principle of law recognizing the changed position of the 

 
5 
C.R. No.991-D of 2014 
 
parties as legal, is in operation. In this regard, reference can be made 
to Talib Hussain and others v. Member, Board of Revenue and 
others (2003 SCMR 549), Mustafa Lakhani v. Pakistan Defense 
Officers Housing Authority, Karachi (2006 SCJ 702), Moulana Atta-
ur-Rehman   v. Al-Hajj Sardar Umar Farooq and others (PLD 2008 
Supreme Court 663), Muhammad Siddiq v. Ashraf Ali and 3 others 
(2000 MLD 781), Faisal Jameel v. The State (2007 MLD 355), 
Secretary Communication and Works Department Government of 
Balochistan and others v. Dad Baksh and  another  (2013 CLC 343) 
and Muhammad Iqbal v. Muhammad Ahmed Ramzani and 2 others 
(2014 CLC 1392). 
11. 
Learned Courts below have rightly appreciated the material 
aspects of the matter, evidence brought on record and applicable law. 
Learned counsel for petitioner could not point out any illegality, 
material irregularity, misreading or non-reading of evidence and 
jurisdictional error in the concurrent decisions of learned Courts below 
warranting any interference by this Court.  
12. 
Resultantly, this revision petition, being devoid of any merits, is 
hereby dismissed. No order as to costs.
