framed by the learned Family Court on 12.10.2019:- 
1. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get a 
decree for recovery of maintenance allowance 
as prayed for, if so, at what rate and for which 
period? OPP 
2. Whether the suit of the plaintiffs is not 
maintainable and liable to be dismissed? OPD

3. Relief.  
  
3.  
 
Parties led their respective evidence. Petitioner No. 
1 appeared as PW-1 and Ahmad Naseem appeared as PW-2. In 
documentary evidence, Exh. P1 to Exh. P31 and Mark-A to 
Mark-G are brought on record. On the other hand, respondent 
No. 3 appeared as DW-1 and produced Abdul Rehman Baig as 
DW-2. As documentary evidence, Exh.D1 to Exh.D5 were 
produced.  
4.  
 
Learned Family Court gave issue-wise findings and 
vide judgment and decree dated 25.05.2021, partially decreed 
the suit and granted following relief in favour of the minors: - 
 
 
“…In view of above discussion, plaintiff No. 
2 being son of defendant is entitled to recover maintenance 
allowance including education expenses from the defendant 
@ Rs. 40,000/- per month w.e.f. 21-June 2017 till date of 
decision of suit. After date of decision of suit plaintiff No. 2 
is entitled to maintenance allowance including education 
expenses @ Rs. 50,000/- per month until his custody 
changes through process of law. Maintenance allowance 
would be enhanced @ 10% annual increase after passing of 
one year from date of decision of suit. 
2.  
 
In view of above discussion, plaintiff No. 3 
being son of defendant is entitled to recover maintenance 
allowance including education expenses from the defendant 
@ Rs. 40,000/- per month w.e.f. 21-June 2017 till date of 
decision of suit. After date of decision of suit plaintiff No. 3 
is entitled to maintenance allowance including education 
expenses @ Rs. 50,000/- per month until his custody 
changes through process of law. Maintenance allowance 
would be enhanced @ 10% annual increase after passing of 
one year from date of decision of suit  
3.  
 
In view of above discussion, issue No. 1 is 
decided partially in favour of plaintiffs….” 
 
5.  
   
The said judgment and decree was assailed by the 
parties through Family Appeals No. 02 and 06 of 2022. The 
appeal of the petitioners bearing No. 02 of 2022 was dismissed, 
whereas, appeal of the respondent-father has been partially 
allowed by the learned Additional District Judge, Lahore vide 
judgment and decree dated 03.02.2023. The maintenance 
allowance of the minors has been reduced  from Rs. 40,000/- per 
month to Rs. 30,000/- per month for each, since 21st June, 2017 

 
Writ Petition No.27381 of 2023          (Judgment) 
 
 
3 
till decision of suit and maintenance allowance of Rs. 50,000- in 
favour of the minors, from decision of suit and onwards, has also 
been reduced to Rs. 30,000/-, per head, with 10% annual 
increase. Being dissatisfied from the same, the present petition 
has been instituted. 
6.    
Malik Noor Muhammad Awan, learned counsel for 
the petitioners, has submitted that the judgment of learned 
Appellate Court is imprecise and it lacks sound reasons, 
therefore, the same requires interference as per law settled in 
case titled “Nazia Bibi and Others Versus Additional District 
Judge, Ferozewala and Others”(PLD 2018 Lahore 916). It is 
further submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioners that 
learned Appellate Court has ignored the several aspects 
requiring consideration such as amount of school fee being paid, 
actual needs of the minors, social status of the parties and their 
families as well as income of the respondent-father that includes 
salary and other emoluments; that the respondent-father who is 
serving as Deputy Inspector General of Punjab Police (in Grade-
20), is drawing Rs. 400,000/- per month after including annual 
bonuses and other perks and privileges. He has also relied on 
pay-slips of other police officers who had been serving as Senior 
Superintendents of police or Deputy Inspector General in the 
police department. Learned counsel for the petitioners contended 
that the respondent-father is commandant of Motorway Police 
Training School; that besides other emoluments it is normal for 
the police officers of given rank that they are given annual 
awards which are normally not less than Rs. 450,000/-; that the 
respondent-father belongs to a rich family; that grandfather of 
minors / father of respondent No. 3 (the „grandfather’), who 
retired as Inspector General of Police, is presently serving as 
country-head of a Singapore based company and he is getting 
Rs. 300,000/- as pension and huge amount per month from his 
present job. Malik Noor Muhammad Awan, learned senior-ASC 

 
Writ Petition No.27381 of 2023          (Judgment) 
 
 
4 
has further relied on some plots in Naval Colony & Sector E-11 
Society, Islamabad, earnings from Arcane Security Agency and 
income from St. Francis High School in Hayatabad, Peshawar. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners added that the minors are 
going to Aitchison College and their fee was about Rs. 40,000/- 
each when the suit was filed and at present the same is about Rs. 
68,500/- and Rs. 74,000/-; that during the wedlock and before 
the dispute, the respondent-father himself obtained admission of 
the minors in Kids Campus and admittedly, the respondent-
father was paying fee of about Rs. 27,000/- to Rs. 30,000/- per 
minor; that this school is known for preparation of children for 
admission in Aitchison College and other premium or expensive 
schools of the Country. He has further relied on the travel 
history of the parties and their stay in five-star hotels in different 
countries.  
7.  
On the other hand, Mr. Muhammad Ayyaz Butt, 
learned counsel for the respondent-father has relied upon the 
salary-slips of the respondent-father and stated that he does not 
have any other income. He has not denied the status of the 
grandfather but submitted that his sources cannot be taken into 
consideration to grant the maintenance allowance to the minors 
as this case is not covered in paragraph No. 370 of book 
compiled by D.F. Mulla‟s on the Principles of Muhammadan 
Law. He has added that the judgment of the learned Appellate 
Court is based on cogent reasons, therefore, it must take 
precedence over the judgment of the learned Family Court. Mr. 
Muhammad Ayyaz Butt, during his arguments, has also relied 
upon cases titled “Humayun Hassan Versus Arslan Humayun 
and another”(PLD 2013 Supreme Court 557), “Shaikh 
Farrukh Hussain Versus Mst. Farah Nishat and Others”(2021 
YLR 1363), “Manzoor Ahmed Versus Hamad Raza and Others” 
(2003 SCMR 1836), “Khalid Mahmood Versus Naseem Akhtar 
and Others”(2019 MLD 820), “Syed Najmul Hassan Versus 

 
Writ Petition No.27381 of 2023          (Judgment) 
 
 
5 
Mst. Nabeela Tabassum and 3 Others”(2001 CLC 78) and 
“Hanzla Khalid and Others Versus Khalid Parvaiz and Others” 
(2019 MLD 1128). 
8.  
I have heard the arguments. The available 
documents have also been perused with the able assistance of 
learned counsel for the parties.  
9.  
Malik Noor Muhammad Awan, learned counsel for 
the petitioners, has emphasized the income of the grandfather 
and claimed that his sources of earning and wealth should also 
be taken into account, while fixing the maintenance of the 
minors. The statutory law in this regard is silent but guidance is 
available in paragraph No. 370 by D.F Mulla‟s on Principles of 
Muhammadan Law. This paragraph reads as follows:- 
 
“Maintenance 
of 
Children 
and 
grandchildren.—(1) A father is bound to maintain 
his sons until they have attained the age of puberty. 
He is also bound to maintain his daughters until 
they are married. But he is not bound to maintain 
his adult sons unless they are disabled by infirmity 
or disease. The fact that the children are in the 
custody of their mother during their infancy (S.352) 
does not relieve the father from the obligation of 
maintaining them. But the father is not bound to 
maintain a child who is capable of being 
maintained out of his or her own property.  
(2). 
If the father is poor, and incapable of 
earning by his own labour, the mother, if she is in 
easy circumstances, is bound to maintain her 
children as the father would be.  
(3). 
If the father is poor and infirm, and the 
mother also is poor, the obligation to maintain the 
children lies on the grandfather, provided he is in 
easy circumstances.”  
 
 
 
 
   (Underlining is added) 
 
10. 
Perusal of above reflects that grandfather when is 
affluent, then the obligation to maintain children lies on the 
grandfather but only when father is poor, infirm and incapable of 
earning by his own labour and mother is also poor. This is not 

 
Writ Petition No.27381 of 2023          (Judgment) 
 
 
6 
the position in the present case. The respondent-father is in 
decent employment and not indigent, thus, holding the 
grandfather responsible to contribute towards maintenance 
allowance is not warranted. Reference, if required, can be made 
to case titled “Ghulam Nabi Versus Muhammad Asghar and 3 
Others” (PLD 1991 Supreme Court 543). The relevant para 
reads as follows:- 
 
“…Although leave was not granted to 
examine this point we permitted the learned 
counsel to advance the same so as to clarify 
the legal position. No doubt grandparents, if 
affluent, will be obliged to maintain 
grandchildren if they are destitute. But the 
command would issue in this behalf when 
there is no other nearer relation and / or 
more responsible in this behalf. Accordingly, 
when a specific proposition was put to the 
learned counsel in this behalf he could not 
advance his argument any further. The 
question posed was: whether, in presence of 
the father the grandparents, whether on the 
paternal or on the maternal side, will be 
more responsible for maintaining their 
grandchildren as compared to the father’s 
duty to maintain his own children learned 
counsel without hesitation admitted that the 
priority-wise it would be the duty of the 
father.”  
 
 
 
            (Underlining is added) 
 
11. 
The reference to the alleged opulence or income of 
the grandfather, including his salary that he is drawing being 
chief of a multinational company and about Rs. 300,000/-, he is 
getting as pension being retired Inspector General or            
other properties, perhaps in present case can only be useful for          
the petitioner-mother to show that the respondent-father does       
not have any other liability. The respondent-father stated    
before me that his brother is a doctor and remaining family   
members are even better placed than the respondent-father 
himself. Same is also apparent from the record. This at          

 
Writ Petition No.27381 of 2023          (Judgment) 
 
 
7 
least can be used as confirmation of the status of the family, 
their easy circumstances and the fact that there is no dependence 
of anyone on the respondent-father but the minors, alone. 
12.  
Fixing quantum of maintenance always requires to 
strike a balance between needs of minors and earnings of a 
father as well as his other sources. The award in favour of 
minors should not be incompatible or inconsistent with the 
financial conditions of father or the one who is held to be 
obliged by law to take care of children. The learned Family 
Courts should consider the education, medical, food expenses 
and other day to day needs of minor(s) at one side and on the 
other hand, the Courts are required to determine the financial 
status of the father. In “Nazia Bibi and Others” case (supra) this 
Court has laid down guidelines, as to how the power to ascertain 
the needs of minor(s) and financials of the father is required to 
be exercised by the learned Family Courts. When a father makes 
it impossible to reach a just conclusion as to his earning or 
paying capacity, by mis-declarations or unfair disclosures as 
well as by hiding his sources then the learned Family Courts are 
empowered to draw adverse inference as per the law settled in 
case titled “Muhammad Asim and Others Versus Mst. Samro 
Begum and Othrs” (PLD 2018 Supreme Court 819). While 
doing the implementation it should also be borne in mind that 
the case is one of maintenance and decree should be passed after 
taking into account the requirements for proper upbringing of a 
child or children after scrutinizing income and finances of father 
but at the same time the order should not result into unjust 
enrichment of one side or operate as vexatious or oppressive to a 
father.  
13.  
The respondent-father during the pendency of the 
suit was serving as Senior Superintendent of Police in Grade-19 
and as per Exh. D2 his net salary or take home was Rs. 
112,074/-. At present the respondent-father is working as 

 
Writ Petition No.27381 of 2023          (Judgment) 
 
 
8 
Deputy Inspector General and in August, 2023 his take home / 
net salary was about Rs. 175,000/-. The argument of Malik Noor 
Muhammad Awan-learned senior ASC that the police-officers of 
the same standing normally and at least once a year are awarded 
with bonuses, could not be denied by respondent-side. The 
petitioners alleged that the respondent-father was getting annual 
bonuses / rewards when he was serving as Senior Superintendent 
of Police, minimum at the rate of Rs. 450,000/- but now since he 
has been promoted such rewards or per annum bonuses in 
routine are always higher than half a million and sometimes, 
keeping in view the conditions and performance, bonuses are 
granted more than once a year; other perks and privileges are in 
addition to it.   
14. 
The respondent-father remained present in the 
Court throughout the proceedings and he could not deny the fact 
that he has been receiving such rewards or bonuses, though his 
learned lawyer vaguely disputed quantum of annual bonuses. 
Same remained the position during the trial when the 
respondent-father after admitting this fact tried to explain the 
same as follows:- 
"۔۔ ۔ ۔ہی درتس ےہ ہک ومرٹوے وپسیل ےس اماہہن وخنتاہ ےک العوہAnnual Reward 
Fund 
 یھب اتلم ےہ
۔ ۔۔۔"

ریمی رلیسی ںیم ےس وچبں اک انن و ہقفن اماہہن ادا وہ راہ ےہ"۔۔۔۔ 
 
15. 
In case titled “Marriam Bibi and Others Versus 
Azhar Iqbal and Others” (PLD 2022 Lahore 840) this Court 
has already concluded that to determine „resources‟ and 
„royalty‟, additional payments can be kept in view. In order to 
ascertain the consistency of rewards / bonuses and their volume, 
this Court directed the respondent-father to produce the details 
of rewards etc. given by concerned department in previous years 
to the respondent-father but for some reasons the respondent-

 
Writ Petition No.27381 of 2023          (Judgment) 
 
 
9 
father has failed to respond. There is no convincing reason 
available for not extending benefit of those rewards or bonuses, 
perks and privileges to the minors. Specially, when the 
respondent-father has no other liability and he has his permanent 
residence at the house of the grandfather and for temporary 
purposes, at the places of his posting, official residence is being 
used.  
16.  
The learned Family Court quite deeply went into 
the evidence led by the parties. It appears that the record was 
examined carefully. The various trips to USA and other 
Countries during the wedlock were also examined by the learned 
Family Court. Somehow, learned Appellate Court, while 
remarkably reducing the quantum of maintenance, could not 
very well grasp the matter. Several pieces of evidence and parts 
of examination have not been discussed, which were worth 
considering to reach at correct conclusion.  
17.  
It is an admitted position that parents (petitioner-
mother and the respondent-father) got the minors admitted in 
„Kids Campus‟ school and the then fee per child was about the 
same as the total maintenance per month is awarded by the 
learned Appellate Court. The respondent-father has already 
admitted in his cross-examination that the minors were going to 
„Kids Campus‟, which is meant for preparation for admission of 
children in premium schools. He unduly remained reluctant to 
state the exact or even tentative amount being paid as fee during 
those years. The following part of his cross-examination is 
noticeable:- 
 "

18. 
Mr. Muhammad Ayyaz Butt, learned counsel for 
the respondent-father, has not stated that the fee of the minors at 
„Kids Campus‟ was paid by some other family member. No such 
evidence or stance is observed, either. Mother is admittedly a 
housewife. No convincing reason is recorded in the judgment-in-
appeal to reduce the maintenance allowance to the level, which 
is less or equal to the fee being paid by the respondent-father in 
the year 2015-16. 
19.  
Mr. Muhammad Ayyaz Butt, learned counsel for 
the respondent-father has repeatedly taken the attention of the 
Court towards the law settled by Honourable Supreme Court in 
cases titled “Amjad Ikram Versus Mst. Asiya Kausar and 2 
Others” (2015 SCMR 1) and “Bahar Shah and Others Versus 
Manzoor Ahmad” (2022 SCMR 284) and argued that in case of 
inconsistency in findings of learned two Courts below, 
preference has to be given to the one rendered by the learned 
Appellate Court. This is correct when the interference of learned 
Appellate Court in findings of learned trial Court is based on 
cogent and confidence inspiring reasons. However, when such 
decision is not based on correct exposition of law and facts then 
leaving it to hold the field is unsafe.  
20.  
Malik Noor Muhammad Awan, learned senior-ASC 
has prayed for decree of the entire fee of the minors and their 
travel expenses by adding other needs. For grant of such prayer 
he has relied on some properties and business of private school 
but when confronted to show any proof of the same, he could 
not do the needful and stated that the same are kept as benami. 
Again no proof, even little, could be brought on record during 
the whole trial for the allegation of benami properties or 
business. As far as the contention of learned counsel for the 
petitioners that maintenance award or decree should cover the 
entire education and other expenses is concerned, it is suffice to 
reproduce the relevant observation of the Supreme Court of 

 
Writ Petition No.27381 of 2023          (Judgment) 
 
 
11 
Pakistan in case titled “Tauqeer Ahmad Qureshi Versus 
Additional District Judge, Lahore and 2 Others” (PLD 2009 
Supreme Court 760):- 
 
“We have given our anxious consideration to 
the entire facts and circumstances of the case. The 
minors are entitled to be maintained by the father 
in the manner befitting the status and financial 
condition of the father and for this reason the 
Family Court is under an obligation while granting 
the maintenance allowance, to keep in mind the 
financial condition and status of the father. It has to 
make an inquiry in this regard. It cannot act 
arbitrarily or whimsically. Furthermore, at the 
same time, the unjust enrichment of the minors 
cannot be permitted at the cost of the father. In the 
present case, there is nothing on the record to show 
that the appellant is a rich man and can afford 
paying at the end, Rs. 6.88 crores to the minors 
towards their maintenance. We have also noticed 
that the Family Court had no basis before it and 
had no criteria for awarding 20% annual increase 
in the maintenance allowance granted by it and it 
gave no reasons for ordering such an increase. It 
thus acted arbitrarily, illegally and whimsically in 
awarding such an exorbitant annual increase in the 
maintenance allowance. There was no justification 
for the annual increase of maintenance allowance 
at the rate of 20%. It was not a reasonable exercise 
of authority by the Family Court. It is well-settled 
that the judicial officers are required to act justly 
and fairly and reasonably in discharge of judicial 
functions. The argument that school fees of the 
minors are more than the rate of maintenance 
allowance granted by the Family Court, therefore, 
the annual increase granted by the Family Court 
should not be interfered with, has also no force. 
The mother, if she desires or can afford, may put 
the children in expensive schools but the father’s 
obligation to maintain the minors is only to the 
extent of his status and financial condition and 
the Family Court must keep these factors in mind 
while granting maintenance allowance.” 
      (Emphasis supplied) 
 
21.  
It appears that the learned Appellate Court has not 
maintained the requisite equilibrium while fixing quantum of 
maintenance for the minors. Several parts of evidence have been 

 
Writ Petition No.27381 of 2023          (Judgment) 
 
 
12 
unduly ignored. The status of the parties and available sources 
have been overlooked. After hearing the arguments and going 
through the record with able assistance of the learned counsel 
for the parties, I am of opinion that it is just to enhance the 
maintenance of the minors, therefore, the same is fixed as Rs. 
40,000/- per month for each minor from the date already fixed 
by the learned Appellate Court, with 10% annual increase.  
        
Petition is allowed in above terms.
