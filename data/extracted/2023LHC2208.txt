Through this consolidated order, W.P.

common questions of facts and law are involved. 
2. 
Through W.P. No.19723 of 2023, stated to 
be filed in public interest, petitioner who is an 
Advocate of this Court has prayed as under: 
 
“In light of the aforesaid facts and grounds 
it is most respectfully prayed that the release price 
of Rs.3900/- fixed by the Respondents be declared 
illegal, unconstitutional, unlawful; misuse, abuse 
and colourful exercise of authority, based upon 
undue enrichment, violative of the Election Act, 
2017 and be struck down by directing the 
Respondents to restore the release price of Rs. 
2200/- per 40 Kg alongwith the subsidy forthwith 
provided in the past in the shape of sale at the rate 
of Rs. 1765/- per 40 Kg in the best interest and 
larger public interest. 
 
It is further prayed that the till the final 
decision of the titled Writ Petition, the increase of 
release price from Rs.2200/- to Rs.3900/- per 40 Kg 
may kindly be suspended in the supreme interest of 
justice. 
 
Any other relief which this Honourable 
Court deem fit and proper may also be awarded.” 
 
3. 
Through connected W.P. No.20229 of 2023, 
stated to have been filed in public interest, 
petitioner, who is a social worker, has prayed as 
under: 
 
“In light of the aforesaid facts and grounds 
it is most respectfully prayed that the notification 

W.P. No. 19723 of 2023  
                                 2 
 
dated 16.03.2023 to the extent of fixing release 
price of existing wheat in the stock (which was 
procured under the wheat Procurement Policy, 
2022-23) at the rate of Rs.3900/- fixed by the 
Respondents be declared illegal, unconstitutional, 
unlawful; misuse, abuse and colourful exercise of 
authority, based upon undue enrichment, violative 
of the Election Act, 2017 and be struck down by 
directing the Respondents to restore the release 
price of Rs. 2200/- per 40 Kg alongwith the subsidy 
forthwith provided in the past in the shape of sale at 
the rate of Rs. 1765/- per 40 Kg in the best interest 
and larger public interest. 
 
It is further prayed that till the final decision 
of the titled Writ Petition, the increase of release 
price of existing stock of wheat from Rs.2200/- to 
Rs.3900/- per 40 Kg may kindly be suspended in the 
supreme interest of justice. 
 
Any other relief which this Honourable 
Court deem fit and proper may also be awarded.” 
 
4. 
The main crux of arguments raised on behalf 
of petitioners is that Government purchased wheat 
for the season 2022-23 at the rate of Rs.2200/- per 
40 kg from the growers, which the Government is 
supplying to the flour mills at the rate of Rs.3900/- 
per 40 kg by fixing said price through notification 
dated 16.03.2023 by increasing the same from 
initial subsidized price of Rs.1765/- per 40 kg 
fixed vide notification dated 19.05.2022, which 
was there-after increased to Rs.2300/- per 40 kg 
through notification dated 20.09.2022. It is 
claimed that even if Government is not in position 
to provide subsidy, it cannot sell wheat to flour 
mills at enhanced rates because by the said act of 
the Government not only price of flour has 
increased manifold resulting in inflation but also 
poor public is suffering from the same and have 
been made to starve. The comparative prices of 
wheat 
and 
flour

On the other hand, the respondents have 
defended the impugned action of the Government 
by controverting the arguments of the counsel for 
the petitioners by relying upon comments/reply 
submitted by the respondents/Food Department 
wherein it is mentioned as under: 
 
“Punjab Food Department procures wheat 
every year at the support price fixed by the 
Government, to maintain food security reserves, 
cater for the requirement of general consumers and 
to stabilize the price of flour and wheat in the open 
market with the intervention of the Wheat Release / 
Milling Policy. During Wheat Procurement Drive 
2022-23, Punjab Food Department procured 4.48 
MMT of wheat in addition to the carry forward 
stock of 0.7 MMT. 
 
Keeping in view, the public interest and 
consumption requirements of public at large/ 
consumers, to overcome any chance of shortage of 
flour, to prevent the price hike in the open market, 
current Wheat Release / Milling Policy, 2022-23 
was notified on 19.05.2022 after approval from the 
Provincial Government (Annex-A). According to 
which, wheat @ Rs.1765/40Kg was being issued at 
the lowest release price even below the support 
price/ purchase price to flour mills of the Punjab, in 
order to provide / sell flour in the open market four 
months earlier than the previous practice of the 
wheat releases. However, on 20.09.2022, the rate of 
subsidized wheat as being issued under the Wheat 
Release 
Policy, 
2022-23 
and 
depicted 
in 
Notification dated 19.05.2022 was enhanced to 
Rs.2300/40kg vide Notification dated 20.09.2022. 
 
Further added that the Government of Sindh 
announced for the current Season @ Rs.4000 per 
40 kg for the year 2023-24 and accordingly 
Government 
of 
Punjab 
also 
notified 
the 
procurement price/minimum support price of wheat 
@ Rs.3900 per 40 kg for the current Wheat 
Procurement Scheme, 2023-24. The open market 
rates responded accordingly and increase in open 
market prices was also witnessed thereof. It is 
pertinent to point out here that due to the early 
release of wheat, the public stocks of wheat started 

W.P. No. 19723 of 2023  
                                 4 
 
to depreciate / decrease and thus, to overcome any 
shortage of wheat, to cater for the consumer 
requirements, to maintain the wheat stocks of the 
Government 
and 
for 
any 
other 
unforeseen 
incidence, the Federal Government was requested 
to allow to procure wheat through import. Thus, the 
Federal Government allowed to import 0.8 MMT of 
wheat which has increased the incidental charges / 
mark up, etc. to be borne out by the Provincial 
Food Department. Considering the Holy Month of 
Ramadan, 
the 
Provincial 
Government 
also 
approved to provide three (03) bags of flour of 
10Kg free of cost to the deserving section of society 
already scrutinized under PMT 60 Score of 
National Socio Economic Registry Survey under the 
BISP. Considering the increase in the procurement 
price as announced by the Government of Sindh, 
Ramadan 
Package, 
to 
prevent 
the 
illegal 
transportation of wheat due to the wheat 
procurement price as fixed by the Government of 
Sindh and to sustain the heavy burden of incidental 
charges and mark up as being borne out due to the 
import of wheat, the Government approved to 
increase the rate of subsidized wheat from Rs.2300/ 
40 Kg to Rs.3900/40Kg from 19.03.2023 (Annex-C). 
It is pertinent to point out here that still 
Government is providing huge amount of subsidy 
while issuing the subsidized wheat @ Rs.3900/40Kg 
to the flour mills. The contentions of the petitioner 
are baseless and the petition is liable to be 
dismissed.” 
 
6. 
The stance of the respondents is that the 
Food Department during wheat procurement drive 
2022-23 procured 4.48 MMT of wheat in addition 
to carryforward stock of 0.7 MMT. To overcome 
any chance of shortage of flour and to prevent the 
price hike in the open market, Wheat Release / 
Milling 
Policy, 
2022-23 
was 
notified 
on 
19.05.2022 after approval from the Provincial 
Government, according to which, wheat @ 
Rs.1765/40Kg was being issued at the lowest 
release price even below the support price/ 
purchase price to flour mills of the Punjab, in order 
to provide / sell flour in the open market four 
months earlier than the previous practice of the 
wheat releases. However, on 20.09.2022, the rate 
of subsidized wheat as being issued under the 

W.P. No. 19723 of 2023  
                                 5 
 
Wheat Release Policy, 2022-23 and depicted in 
Notification dated 19.05.2022 was enhanced to 
Rs.2300/40kg vide Notification dated 20.09.2022. 
It is further added that the Government of Sindh 
had announced wheat procurement price for the 
current Season @ Rs.4000 per 40 kg for the year 
2023-24 and accordingly Government of Punjab 
also notified the procurement price/minimum 
support price of wheat @ Rs.3900 per 40 kg for 
the current Wheat Procurement Scheme, 2023-24. 
The open market rates responded accordingly and 
increase in open market prices was also witnessed 
thereof. It has also been pointed out that due to the 
early release of wheat, the public stocks of wheat 
started to depreciate / decrease and thus, to 
overcome any shortage of wheat, to cater for the 
consumer requirements, to maintain the wheat 
stocks of the Government and for any other 
unforeseen incidence, the Federal Government was 
requested to allow to procure wheat through 
import. Thus, the Federal Government allowed to 
import 0.8 M.MT of wheat which has increased the 
incidental charges / mark up, etc. to be borne out 
by the Provincial Food Department. Considering 
the Holy Month of Ramadan, the Provincial 
Government also approved to provide three (03) 
bags of flour of 10Kg free of cost to the deserving 
section of society already scrutinized under PMT 
60 Score of National Socio Economic Registry 
Survey under the BISP. Considering the increase 
in the procurement price as announced by the 
Government of Sindh, Ramadan Package, to 
prevent the illegal transportation of wheat due to 
the wheat procurement price as fixed by the 

W.P. No. 19723 of 2023  
                                 6 
 
Government of Sindh and to sustain the heavy 
burden of incidental charges and mark up as being 
borne out due to the import of wheat, the 
Government approved to increase the rate of 
subsidized wheat from Rs.2300/ 40 Kg to 
Rs.3900/40Kg from 19.03.2023. It has also been 
pointed out that still Government is providing huge 
amount of subsidy while issuing the subsidized 
wheat @ Rs.3900/40Kg to the flour mills.  
7. 
The claim of the respondents is that due to 
early supply of wheat to mills, the previous stocks 
were diminishing and in view thereof to avoid 
likelihood of shortage, wheat has been procured at 
higher rate through import and other sources and 
as the market sources control the price of wheat 
and flour therefore, the price at which the wheat 
was to be provided to the flour mills had to be 
raised to Rs.3900/- per 40 Kg which price had also 
been fixed by providing huge subsidy because the 
present market price is much higher. 
8. 
The petitioners claim that stock of 3.3 MMT 
wheat is still available with the respondents but the 
same is an assertion only and they have not shown 
from any document on record the exact quantity of 
stocks of wheat previously procured by the 
Government or the Food department and still 
available with those respondents, the cost of 
storage of the same, the amount obtained as 
loan/finance by the department to procure said 
stocks, rate and amount of mark-up to be paid for 
return of said finance and other relevant factors 
necessary for determining the price by the 
Government or the Food department and their only 
reliance is on the price at which the wheat was 

W.P. No. 19723 of 2023  
                                 7 
 
procured in the procurement process for season 
2022-23, hence, this Court cannot assume that 
Government which is claiming to have procured 
additional wheat is not providing the correct facts 
about the availability of stocks of wheat for the 
said procurement or is making wrong statement 
about subsequent procurement and import at 
higher rates. The pricing of a commodity such like 
wheat, etc., involves several factors and is 
obviously directed and controlled by market forces 
and the determination of said aspect of the matter 
falls within the exclusive domain of the executive 
and polices framed by them from time to time. 
This Court does not ordinarily interfere in the 
policy decisions of the government unless the 
same are shown to be without lawful authority, 
perverse and against any provision of law and the 
Court’s role was not to interfere in policy 
decisions, unless it was manifest that, such policy 
decisions were the outcome of arbitrary exercise of 
power, mala fides, patently illegal or manifestly 
unreasonable. Reliance may be placed upon 
judgments reported as “Abdul Hameed and others 
Vs. Water and Power Development Authority 
through Chairman Lahore and others” (2021 
SCMR 1230), “Asaf Fasihuddin Khan Vs. 
Government of Pakistan” (2014 SCMR 676) and 
“M/s Dossani Travels Pvt. Ltd.  and others Vs. 
Messrs. Travel Shop Pvt. Ltd. and others” (PLD 
2014 SC 1). The counsel for the petitioner has not 
been able to point out from the facts of the instant 
case availability of any of the grounds mentioned 
in the afore-referred judgments for this Court to 

W.P. No. 19723 of 2023  
                                 8 
 
interfere in the policy decision whereby the price 
of wheat has been fixed at Rs.3900 per 40 kg. 
9. 
Learned 
counsel 
for 
petitioner 
has 
vehemently argued that caretaker Government had 
not got jurisdiction and could not have fixed the 
prices by enhancing the previous prices which 
even otherwise is against the Election Act, 2017 
but this Court is not impressed by the said stance 
taken by the learned counsel for the reason that 
previous stock was depleting resulting in fresh 
procurement and import of wheat at higher rate 
and prices have been increased to be compatible 
with the open market and price fixed in province 
of Sindh which was required to prevent 
transportation and smuggling of wheat out of 
province and its shortage and the same had 
necessitated taking of immediate measures by the 
Government without any loss of time to cater to 
the needs of the people and to avoid shortage of 
wheat, which exercise, if not carried out 
immediately, could become a reason for increase 
of wheat price and making the same out of reach of 
the general public. The Caretaker Government by 
its mandate provided by Section 230(a) of Election 
Act, 2017 was empowered to manage and take 
necessary steps to cater to the said situation as the 
same related to the day to day matters necessary to 
run the affairs of the Government and the fixing of 
wheat price was within the jurisdiction and powers 
of the said Government. 
10. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner states that 
the stance taken by the Government relating to 
smuggling or transporting wheat out of province is 
without any legal justification for the reason that it 

W.P. No. 19723 of 2023  
                                 9 
 
is the Government itself which has to prevent the 
said situation from arising. In response to the same 
the respondents claim that increase in price of 
wheat had to be made to make the same 
compatible with market prices, which amongst 
others is a measure taken by the Government to 
prevent smuggling and transportation out of 
province. The said stance taken by the respondents 
effectively negates the stance of the petitioners. 
11. 
Be that as it may, it is settled by now that 
fixation of prices of commodities such like 
purchase and sale of wheat by Government, 
provision of wheat to flour mills, subsidized value, 
framing of policy to provide flour to public at a 
particular rate or free of cost to deserving people 
of society falling below the poverty line is within 
policy making domain of Government which 
function has to be performed by the Government 
keeping in view the afore-mentioned position 
including availability of stocks coupled with 
demand and supply and other factors regulating 
market forces and thereafter price is to be fixed by 
the executive on the basis of data available with it 
and the same cannot be fixed at the whims and 
desires of the petitioners who even otherwise 
neither have any such data available with them nor 
they have the capability/capacity to determine 
various aspects of the price fixing criteria and the 
said power of the executive cannot be ordinarily 
interfered with by this Court in its constitutional 
jurisdiction. In reaching the said conclusion, 
reliance in this behalf, inter alia, is placed upon 
principles laid down in judgment in the matter of 
“Regarding Enormous increase in the price of 

W.P. No. 19723 of 2023  
                                 10 
 
Flour” (2014 SCMR 329) relating to fixation of 
price of wheat, wherein the Court referred the 
matter of fixation of wheat price for determination 
to the Government/Executive by observing that 
under the Price Control and prevention of 
Profiteering and Hoarding Act, 1977, fixation of 
prices is to be dealt with by the Federal 
Government but it seems that no such exercise has 
been undertaken by the Federal or Provincial 
Governments under the relevant provision of law. 
It was further held that Provincial Governments 
are duty-bound to control all the prices of 
foodstuffs without any discrimination. Reliance 
may also be placed on case reported as “Mian 
Muhammad Aslam versus Federation of Pakistan 
through President and 4 others” (PLD 2020 
Islamabad 352), which although relates to fixation 
of fuel prices, yet principles mentioned therein are 
applicable to the instant case, wherein it is 
provided that grievance of the petitioner is 
regarding increase in prices of petroleum products 
by the Federal Government. The pricing of a 
commodity involves several factors and is 
obviously directed by the market forces. It has 
nexus with the economic conditions and policies of 
the executive. It thus falls within the exclusive 
domain of the executive branch of the State. 
12. 
This Court in case titled “Munir Ahmad 
versus Government of Pakistan through Secretary 
Finance, Islamabad and 19 others” (PLD 2022 
Lahore 108), while hearing the matter of fixation 
of price of sugar, declined to indulge itself in 
technicalities of price fixation by observing as 
under:- 

W.P. No. 19723 of 2023  
                                 11 
 
“12.  On being confronted that appeal is 
available against this Notification before Appellate 
Committee, under the Rules, the petitioners’ side, 
on instructions, wanted to argue the case against 
the exercise of power, prior to the promulgation of 
the Rules. 
 
       The Court is not convinced. Since the 
legal issues have already been resolved or settled, 
therefore, this court would not indulge itself in 
technicalities of price fixation, when a competent 
forum, for this purpose, has already been created 
under the law. The august Supreme Court, while 
remanding the case has given following observation 
on exercise of jurisdiction by this Court under 
Article 199 of the Constitution, which are binding 
under the Article 189:-- 
 
"2. The Constitutional Courts of the 
country have a duty to resolve legal disputes 
coming before them in accordance with the 
Constitution and the law. In the discharge of 
their duties and functions the Courts do not 
supervise pricing nor monitor profit and 
loss 
dealings 
by 
or 
between 
the 
stakeholders. In our view, the High Court 
has in the present case entered the uncertain 
territory of monitoring commercial and 
policy terms regulating the supply of an 
edible commodity in the market. This 
endeavor is far removed from its jurisdiction 
vested by Article 199 of the Constitution and 
is likely to involve technical details that are 
outside the realm of judicial adjudication.”” 
 
13. 
Another aspect of the matter is that 
respondents claim that most of the wheat of the 
procurement-2022/23 purchased by them had been 
supplied to flour mills and very little stock was 
available with the Food Department, therefore, 
more stock was required to be procured to avoid 
shortage of stock for emergent situations, for 
which purpose, they had to import 0.8 MMT wheat 
to 
maintain 
the 
minimum 
stock, 
which 
procurement has been made at the rate of more 
than Rs.4000/- per 40 kg calculated, inter alia, on 
the basis of loans obtained by the Food 
Department from banks returnable at interest and it 
is claimed that due to the fact that the wheat is 

W.P. No. 19723 of 2023  
                                 12 
 
stored at different places throughout the whole 
province, hence, no distinction can be made 
between previously and recently procured wheat 
stock for supply to various mills as the respondents 
cannot supply wheat at two different rates to the 
mills, which itself may be treated as discriminatory 
in the given situation, hence price of available 
stocks after fresh procurement has evenly been 
fixed; besides the Government of Sindh has 
already fixed price of wheat at the rate of 
Rs.4000/- per 40 kg which also tends to lead to 
transportation and smuggling from Province of 
Punjab to Province of Sindh because of disparity in 
prices 
maintained 
by 
different 
provinces; 
moreover, what quantity of previous stock was 
available and what was its present position, 
location, storage charges, loans obtained from 
banks for procurement and rate of return coupled 
with other factors relating to market forces and 
fixation of prices by other Provinces as well as in 
open market are factual aspects of the matter 
which need to be considered by the government for 
fixation of price from time to time and same 
requires determination of some disputed facts 
which is also beyond the jurisdiction of this Court 
and hence this petition is not proceedable on the 
basis of the said grounds. Reliance is placed on 
“Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through 
Chief Secretary, Peshawar and others versus 
Intizar Ali and others” (2022 PLC (CS) 837 
(SC)), wherein it is provided that Superior Courts 
cannot engage in factual controversies and matters 
pertaining to factual controversy can only be 
resolved after thorough inquiry and recording of 

W.P. No. 19723 of 2023  
                                 13 
 
evidence in a civil court/appropriate forum. 
Reliance may also be placed on the principles laid 
down in “Pakistan WAPDA Employees Pegham 
Union 
versus 
Member, 
National 
Industrial 
Relations Commission, Islamabad and others” 
(2014 SCMR 1676) wherein it is settled that High 
Court cannot resolve factual controversies in 
Constitutional Jurisdiction. 
14. 
It is important to note here that it is not the 
vested right of individuals or public at large i.e. 
consumers to claim that subsidy should be 
mandatorily provided to them in purchase of wheat 
or flour, hence, this Court in the absence of any 
law or policy justifying the same cannot issue 
direction to respondents to provide the same to the 
consumers at subsidized rates. Moreover, supply of 
flour free of cost to the underprivileged can also 
not be called in question before this Court as it is 
for the Government to provide the people living 
below poverty line with sources for providing 
them with food and for that purpose if the situation 
so demands, the Government can provide flour 
free of cost to the people who cannot purchase the 
same from their own sources, therefore, the 
contention of the petitioner that supply of free 
wheat by the Government be stopped to provide 
wheat and flour to the others citizens at 
subsidized/lower rates is without any legal 
justification and said supply of flour free of cost 
under Ramadan package providing for three bags 
of flour of 10kg each being a policy decision of the 
Government and not shown to be suffering from 
any 
discrimination 
rather 
being 
based 
on 
intelligent differentia and reasonable classification 

W.P. No. 19723 of 2023  
                                 14 
 
did not merit to be interfere with by this Court for 
the reason that Government is authorized to make 
such classifications if the situation so requires. 
Reliance is placed on judgment reported as “I.A. 
Sherwani and others versus Government of 
Pakistan through Secretary Finance Division, 
Islamabad and others” (1991 SCMR 1041). 
15. 
In view of what has been discussed above, 
as the fixing of price of wheat is within the policy 
making domain of the Provincial Government, 
which is executive organ of the State and regulates 
the same through the Food Department by basing 
its decision on various factors and no mala fide, 
discrepancy, perversity or violation of any law has 
been pointed out by the petitioners in the instant as 
well as in the connected petition against the policy 
decision of the Government whereby price of 
wheat has been fixed at Rs.3,900/- per 40kg and 
the said fixation of price does not in any manner 
amount to unjust enrichment of the Government as 
benefit of the same is being provided to deserving 
people, hence, the said decision cannot be declared
