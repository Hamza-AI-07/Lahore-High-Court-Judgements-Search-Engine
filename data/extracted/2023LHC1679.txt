“Stated that 25.04.2017, at about 10.45 am, I along with 
Muhammad Qasim, who is my nephew, Muhammad Ramzan s/o Allah

Bachayya and Muhammad Ramzan s/o Allah Wasayya both my cousin in 
relation were irrigating our own land in Bohar Boghay Shah, Suddenly 
accused persons namely Muhammad Shahbaz Shah s/o Shabbir Shah 
armed with pistol 30-bore Muhammad Shakir s/o Nazzar Muhammad 
armed with pistol 30- bore along with their three unknown accused persons 
each armed with pistol 30-bore reached and after breaking the watercourse 
started irrigating their land. On this, Muhammad Qasim tried to stop them. 
Shehbaz Shah made a straight fire from his pistol which hit Muhammad 
Qasim in front of his chest who fell on the ground. When I, Muhammad 
Ramzan s/o Allah Bachayya, and Muhammad Ramzan s/o Allah Wasayya 
step forward to rescue him, Shahbaz accused made second fire shot which 
hit on the right leg's thigh of Muhammad Ramzan s/o Allah Bachayya, 
Muhammad Shakir made a fire shot which Muhammad Ramzan s/o Allah 
Wasayya on the right upper arm, Muhammad Shakir made second fire shot 
which hit on the right thigh of Ramzan s/o Allah Bachayya. Whereas, three 
unknown accused persons who were familiar to us by faces and later on 
their names were known to us. Among them one unknown person made a 
straight fire shot the same landed on the left upper arm of Ramzan s/o Allah 
Bachayya. Second unknown accused made a fire shot which hit Ramzan 
s/o Allah Wasayya on the right leg's thigh. Third fire shot was made by 
third unknown accused and the same hit on the left thigh of Ramzan s/o 
Allah Bachayya. In the meanwhile the accused persons made firing. On the 
hue and cry and on the noise of firing PWs namely Muhammad Shaffi and 
Muhammad Azam attracted the spot, on seeing the witnesses four persons 
who were standing near the Khoh Meer Wala also started firing and the 
above accused persons fled away from the spot along with said four persons 
on motorcycles. I along with PWs tried to rescue Muhammad Qasim who 
had succumbed to the injuries till then at the spot. Whereas, PWS 
Muhammad Ramzan s/o Allah Wasayya and Muhammad Ramzan s/o 
Allah Bachayya got also severely injured. Motive behind the occurrence is 
that we had a dispute over irrigation water. Above named accused persons 
have done a great wrong by committing murder of Muhammad Qasim and 
injuring Muhammad Ramzan s/o Allah Wasayya and Muhammad Ramzan 
s/o Allah Bachayya. Thereafter, the police attracted at the scene of crime 
and I submitted the complaint application Ex.PB for the registration of case 
to the police.

whose fire was hit on the left upper arm of Muhammad Ramzan s/o Allah 
Bachayya.”

up the remaining prosecution witness as being unnecessary and closed the 
prosecution evidence after tendering in evidence the reports of Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh. P.Z. and Exh. P.Z/1). 
 
8. 
After the closure of prosecution evidence, the learned trial court 
examined the appellants namely Muhammad Shahbaz son of Syed Shabbir 
Hussain Shah and Muhammad Shakir son of Nazar Muhammad under section 
342 Cr.P.C. and in answer to the question why this case against you and why 
the P.W.s have deposed against you, they replied that they  had been involved 
in the case falsely and were innocent. The appellants namely Muhammad 
Shahbaz son of Syed Shabbir Hussain Shah and Muhammad Shakir son of 
Nazar Muhammad, opted not to get themselves examined under section 
340(2) Cr.P.C. however, the appellant namely Muhammad Shahbaz submitted 
a certified copy of Wara Bandi (Exh.DC) as evidence in his  defence.  
 
9. 
At the conclusion of the trial, the learned Sessions Judge, Lodhran 
convicted and sentenced the appellants as referred to above.

10. 
The contention of the learned counsel for the appellants precisely is that 
the whole case is fabricated and false and the prosecution remained unable to 
prove the facts in issue and did not produce any unimpeachable, admissible, 
and relevant evidence. Learned counsel for the appellants further contended 
that the story of the prosecution mentioned in the statements of the witnesses, 
on the face of it, was highly improbable. Learned counsel for the appellants 
further contended that the statements of the prosecution witnesses were not 
worthy of any reliance. The learned counsel for the appellants also submitted 
that the recovery of the pistol (P-16) and two live bullets (P-17 and P-18) from 
the appellant namely Muhammad Shakir son of Nazar Muhammad and the 
recovery of the pistol (P-19) and two live bullets (P-20 and P-21) from the 
appellant namely  Muhammad Shahbaz son of Syed Shabbir Hussain Shah  
were full of procedural defects, of no legal worth and value, and were result 
of fake proceedings. The learned counsel for the appellants also argued that 
the appellants had been involved in the occurrence only on suspicion. The 
learned counsel for the appellants finally submitted that the prosecution had 
totally failed to prove the case against the accused beyond the shadow of a 
doubt.   
 
11. 
On the other hand, the learned Deputy Prosecutor General along with 
the learned counsel for the complainant, contended that the prosecution has 
proved its case beyond the shadow of doubt by producing independent 
witnesses. The learned Deputy Prosecutor General along with the learned 
counsel for the complainant, further argued that the deceased died as a result 
of injuries suffered at the hands of the appellant namely Muhammad Shahbaz

son of Syed Shabbir Hussain Shah  and the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9), Muhammad Ramzan son 
of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) were also injured at the hands of the appellants. 
The learned Deputy Prosecutor General along with the learned counsel for the 
complainant, further contended that the medical evidence also corroborated 
the statements of the eye witnesses. The learned Deputy Prosecutor General 
along with the learned counsel for the complainant, further argued that the 
recovery of the pistol (P-16) and two live bullets (P-17 and P-18) from the 
appellant namely Muhammad Shakir son of Nazar Muhammad and the 
recovery of the pistol (P-19) and two live bullets (P-20 and P-21) from the 
appellant namely  Muhammad Shahbaz son of Syed Shabbir Hussain Shah  
also corroborated the ocular account. The learned Deputy Prosecutor General 
along with the learned counsel for the complainant, further contended that 
there was no occasion for the prosecution witnesses, who were related to the 
deceased, to substitute the real offenders with the innocent in this case. Lastly, 
the learned Deputy Prosecutor General along with the learned counsel for the 
complainant prayed for the rejection of the appeals. The learned counsel for 
the complainant also argued that the Criminal Appeal No.36 of 2018, assailing 
the acquittal of Muhammad Shakir son of Nazar Muhammad by the learned 
trial court from the charge under section 302 P.P.C., also merited acceptance. 
 
12. 
We have heard the learned counsel for the appellants, the learned 
counsel for the complainant, the learned Deputy Prosecutor General and 
perused the record with their able assistance.

13. 
The ocular account of the case was furnished by Muhammad Rafique 
(PW-8) , Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9), Muhammad 
Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) and Muhammad Shafi (PW-12). No 
doubt that the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan son of 
Allah Wasayya (PW-9), Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya (PW-
11) were injured during the occurrence however the stamp of injuries on the 
person of a witness may be proof of his presence at the place of occurrence, 
at the time of occurrence, however the same can never guarantee a truthful 
deposition. Injuries statedly received by a witness during an incident do not 
warrant acceptance of his evidence without scrutiny. At the most, such 
traumas can be taken as an indication of his presence on the spot, but still his 
evidence is to be scrutinized on the benchmark of principles laid down for the 
appraisal of evidence. It is not a given that a witness who suffered injuries 
during the occurrence will depose nothing but the truth. Even otherwise, it is 
not a simple presence of a witness at the crime scene but his credibility, which 
makes him a reliable witness. It has been held by the august Supreme Court 
of Pakistan repeatedly that the facts which an injured witness narrates are not 
to be implicitly accepted rather, they are to be attested and appraised on the 
principles applied for the appreciation of evidence of any prosecution witness 
regardless of him being injured or not. Guidance is sought from the principle 
enunciated by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Nazir 
Ahmad vs. Muhammad Iqbal and another (2011 SCMR 527) where at page 
534 the august Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased to hold as under: 
“It is settled law that injuries of P.W. are only indication of his 
presence at the spot but are not affirmative proof of his credibility and 
truth”.

Guidance is also sought from the principle enunciated by the august Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in the case of Amin Ali and another Vs. The State (2011 
SCMR 323) where the august Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased to hold 
that presence of injuries does not stamp a witness to be a truthful one and 
observed as under :-. 
“12. Certainly, the presence of the injured witnesses cannot be doubted at the 
place of incident, but the question is as to whether they are truthful witnesses 
or otherwise, because merely the injuries on the persons of P.Ws. would not 
stamp them truthful witnesses. It has been held in the case of Said Ahmed supra 
as under:-- 
  
"It is correct that the two eye-witnesses are injured and the injuries on 
their persons do indicate that they were not self-suffered. But that by itself 
would not s h o w  that they had, in view of the aforenoted circumstances, 
told the truth in the Court about the occurrence; particularly, also the 
role of the deceased and the eye-witnesses. It cannot be ignored that these 
two witnesses are closely related to the deceased, while the two other eye-
witnesses mentioned in the F.I.R. namely, Abdur Rashid and Riasat were 
not examined at the trial. This further shows that the injured eyewitnesses 
wanted to withhold the material aspects of the case from the Court and 
the prosecution was apprehensive that if independent witnesses are 
examined, their depositions might support the plea of the accused." 
  
 
In the case of Mehmood Hayat supra at page 1417, it has been observed as 
 
under:-- 
  
"10. There is no cavil with the proposition laid down in the case of Zaab 
Din and another v. The State (PLD 1986 Peshawar 188) that merely 
because the P.Ws. had stamp of firearm injuries on their person was not 
per se tantamount to a stamp of credence on their testimony." 
  
In the case of Mehmood Ahmed supra, this Court at page 7 observed as under: 
  
"For an injured witness whose presence at the occurrence is not disputed 
it can safely be concluded that he had witnessed the incident. But the facts 
he narrates are not to be implicitly accepted merely because he is an 
injured witness. His testimony is to be tested and appraised on the 
principles applied for appreciation of any other prosecution witness." 
  
13. From the above evidence of the P. Ws., they do not appear to be truthful 
witnesses; therefore, no implicit reliance can be placed on their evidence.” 
 
With this principle of appreciation of evidence in our minds that an injured 
witness can not be presumed to be also a truthful witness, we have proceeded 
to examine the statements of the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad 
Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9), Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah

Bachayya (PW-11). We find that the prosecution evidence with regard to the 
number of injuries suffered by the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad 
Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9), Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah 
Bachayya (PW-11) is quite contradictory and the prosecution failed to prove 
that out of the two prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan son of 
Allah Wasayya (PW-9) and Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya 
(PW-11), who had suffered what injuries . The prosecution itself got examined 
Dr. Shahid Riaz (PW-1), who on 25.04.2017 was posted as Senior Registrar, 
Orthopedic Ward , BV hospital Bahawalpur  and on the same day, had 
medically examined Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya  (PW-
11).  According to the statement of  Dr. Shahid Riaz (PW-1)  , on examining 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya  (PW-11), he observed the 
following injuries on the person of Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah 
Bachayya  (PW-11). 
“ DESCRIPTION OF WOUNDS 
1. Wound of about 5X5cm on medial aspect of right mid thigh  
2. Wound of about 0.5X0.5 cm present on the right anterior superior iliac 
spine 
3. Wound of about 0.5X0.5 cm over the right heal 
4. Wound of about 2X2 cm on the medial aspect of left mid thigh  
5. Wound of about 0.5x0.5 cm in the left forearm about 5cm below the 
elbow. 
6. Wound of about 1X1 cm on the medial aspect on left thigh near the 
inguinal area.”

Contrary to the statement of Dr. Shahid Riaz (PW-1) that on examining 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya  (PW-11), he had observed as 
many as six injuries on the person of Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah 
Bachayya  (PW-11), Dr. Muhammad Imran Hashmi (PW-7),  who also 
medically examined Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) 
on 25.04.2017 observed only two injuries present on the person of 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) and described the said 
injuries as under:- 
“Injury No.1 
 
Wound of fire arm. Wound of entry lower side forearm located 
below axial and wound of exit lateral anterior side of fire arm. Referred to 
BVH, Bahawalpur.  
INJURY NO.2. 
 
Wound of entrance just below hip margin inverted and sound of exit 
present medial side of thigh. Injury KUO, referred to BVH, Bahawalpur. 
After surgical notes no bone fractures of femur.” 
 
In this manner, there are two versions of the prosecution evidence itself with 
regard to the number of injuries suffered by the prosecution witness namely 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11). According to Dr. 
Shahid Riaz (PW-1), on examining Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah 
Bachayya  (PW-11), he had observed as many as six injuries on the person 
of Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11), whereas 
according to Dr. Muhammad Imran Hashmi (PW-7),  who also medically 
examined Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) on 

Murder Reference No. 09 of 2021

17 
 
25.04.2017, he had observed only two injuries present on the person of 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11). In this manner, it 
cannot be determined by us that the prosecution witness namely Muhammad 
Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) had suffered from two injuries or 
six injuries. As a corollary to the above contradictory statements of the two 
Medical Officers who had examined the prosecution witness namely 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) on 25.04.2017, now 
a deep fissure has developed in the prosecution case with regard to the very 
identity of the person who was examined by  Dr. Shahid Riaz (PW-1) and Dr. 
Muhammad Imran Hashmi (PW-7)  on 25.04.2017 . Furthermore , if the said 
Medical Officers had indeed examined the prosecution witness namely 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) is an assertion left not 
proved. 
14. 
There also exists similar kind of muddle in the prosecution case with 
regard to the injuries observed on the person of the prosecution witness 
namely Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9). The prosecution 
itself got examined Dr. Noman Ashraf (PW-6)  , who on 25.04.2017 was 
posted as Medical Officer , Surgical Ward No.2, BV hospital Bahawalpur  and 
on the same day, had medically examined Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah 
Wasayya  (PW-9) . According to the statement of   Dr. Noman Ashraf (PW-
6), on examining Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya  (PW-9) , he 
had observed the following injuries on the person of prosecution witness 
namely Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya  (PW-9) :- 
“ I. On the right thigh 1 one wound on lateral side.

II. Two lacerated wounds 2 one wound on the medial side. 
On the left arm lacerated wound on the medial and lateral side.” 
Contrary to the statement of Dr. Noman Ashraf (PW-6)  that on examining 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya  (PW-9), he had observed only  
two injuries on the person of Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya  
(PW-9), Dr. Muhammad Imran Hashmi (PW-7),  who also medically 
examined Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9) on 
25.04.2017 , observed as many as seven injuries present on the person of 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya  (PW-9) and described the said 
injuries as under:- 
“INJURY NO.1. KUO 
 
Wound of about 5 cm X 5 cm present on medial aspect of right mid 
thigh. Bone exposed and injury is of fire arm. 
INJURY NO.2. KUO 
 
Wound of about 0.5 cm X 0.5 cm present on the right anterior 
superior iliac supine. 
INJURY NO.3. 
 
Wound of about 0.5 cm X 0.5 cm present over right heal (sic) . 
INJURY NO.4. 
 
Wound of about 2 cm X 2 cm in medial aspect of hip.

Wound of about 1 cm X 1 cm on medial aspect of left thigh.  
INJURY NO.7. 
 
Left shaft of humerus fracture. .” 
 
In this manner, there are also  two versions of the prosecution evidence itself 
with regard to the number of injuries suffered by the prosecution witness 
namely Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya  (PW-9). According to 
Dr.  Noman Ashraf (PW-6)  , on examining Muhammad Ramzan son of 
Allah Wasayya  (PW-9), he had observed only two injuries on the person of 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya  (PW-9), whereas according to 
Dr. Muhammad Imran Hashmi (PW-7),  who also medically examined 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya  (PW-9) on 25.04.2017, he had 
observed as many as seven injuries present on the person of Muhammad 
Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya  (PW-9). In this manner, it cannot be 
determined by us that whether the prosecution witness namely Muhammad 
Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya  (PW-9)  had suffered from two injuries or 
seven injuries. As a result of the above contradictory statements of the two 
Medical Officers who had examined the prosecution witness namely 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya  (PW-9) on 25.04.2017, now 
a deep fracture has developed in the prosecution case with regard to the very 
identity of the person who had been examined by  Dr. Noman Ashraf (PW-6)  
and Dr. Muhammad Imran Hashmi (PW-7)  on 25.04.2017 . Whether the said 
Medical Officers had indeed examined the prosecution witness namely 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya  (PW-9) was never proved. The 
learned counsel for the complainant as well as the learned Deputy Prosecutor

General, despite our repeated enquiries, have shown their inability to explain 
this inherent and fatal flaw in the prosecution case with regard to the very 
identity of the persons who were examined by the Medical Officers on 
25.04.2017. This fact alone is in itself sufficient to discard the whole 
prosecution case as the evidence in the case has been collected in an abject 
lax manner, working more to create further confusion regarding the facts in 
issue rather than proving the said facts.  
15. 
Another fatal flaw which has been discovered by us in the statements 
made by the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Rafique (PW-8) , 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9), Muhammad Ramzan son 
of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) and Muhammad Shafi (PW-12) are the 
contradictory statements made by the said witnesses with regard to the injuries 
suffered by  the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan son of 
Allah Wasayya (PW-9) and Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya 
(PW-11). According to the statement of the prosecution witness namely 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9), the prosecution witness 
namely Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) suffered an 
injury on his left thigh and the accused had also make several fires, hitting 
on the legs of the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ramzan son 
of Allah Bachayya (PW-11), whereas  according to the statement of the 
prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya 
(PW-11), he suffered an injury on his left arm, and did not state that he was 
hit by various bullets fired by the accused on his legs. Muhammad Ramzan 
son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9) in his statement before the learned trial court, 
stated as under:- 

Murder Reference No. 09 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 254 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 729-J of 2017 
Criminal Appeal    No.36 of 2018 
 
 
21 
 
“Whereas, three unknown accused persons who were familiar to us by faces 
and later on their names were known to us. Among them one unknown 
person made a straight fire shot the same landed on the left thigh of 
Ramzan s/o Allah Wasayya. Second unknown accused made a fire shot 
which hit me on my right leg's thigh. Third fire shot was made by third 
unknown accused and the same hit on the left leg of Ramzan s/o Allah 
Bachayya. And thereafter, they kept making firing which hit on different 
portion of legs of Muhammad Ramzan s/o Allah Bachayya.” (emphasis 
supplied)  
Contrary to the above, Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) 
in his statement before the learned trial court, stated as under:- 
“Among them one unknown person made a straight fire shot the same landed 
on my left upper arm. Second unknown accused made a fire shot which hit 
on right leg's thigh of Ramzan s/o Allah Wasayya. Third fire shot was made 
by third unknown and the same hit me on the left leg. The occurrence has 
been witnesses by me, complainant and eye witnesses.” 
16. 
We have also noted that the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad 
Rafique (PW-8), Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9), 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) and Muhammad Shafi 
(PW-12)  did not explain the presence of independent injuries present on the 
bodies of the injured  prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan son 
of Allah Wasayya (PW-9) and Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya 
(PW-11). As mentioned above, the prosecution witness namely Muhammad 
Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9) did state that  the prosecution witness 
namely Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) had suffered 
several injuries after being hit with bullets on his legs, however, the 

Murder Reference No. 09 of 2021

Criminal Appeal    No. 729-J of 2017 
Criminal Appeal    No.36 of 2018 
 
 
22 
 
prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya 
(PW-11) himself did not make any such statement. Moreover, as discussed 
above, the prosecution got recorded contradictory statements with regard to 
the number and the locale of the injuries suffered by the injured  prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9) and 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11). In view of the 
statements of the Medical Officers who had examined the injured  prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9) and 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11), it cannot be explained 
as to which of the two injured  prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad 
Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9) and Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah 
Bachayya (PW-11) had suffered which injuries. Moreover, the presence of 
extra injuries on the persons of the injured prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9) and Muhammad Ramzan 
son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) was never explained. Then the apertures of 
the injuries observed  on the bodies of the injured  prosecution witnesses 
namely Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9) and Muhammad 
Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) do not commensurate with the 
aperture of the bullets allegedly used by the appellants to cause the said 
injuries. The contradictions in the ocular account of the occurrence, as 
narrated by the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Rafique (PW-8) , 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9), Muhammad Ramzan son 
of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) and Muhammad Shafi (PW-12) and the medical 
evidence as furnished by Dr. Shahid Riaz (PW-1) , Dr. Noman Ashraf (PW-
6) and Dr. Muhammad Imran Hashmi (PW-7)  , sound the death knell for the

prosecution case against the appellants namely Muhammad Shahbaz and 
Muhammad Shakir  and prove to be the cause of its sad demise. The 
prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Rafique (PW-8), Muhammad 
Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9), Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah 
Bachayya (PW-11) and Muhammad Shafi (PW-12) were proven not to have 
deposed truthfully with regard to the appellants namely Muhammad Shahbaz 
and Muhammad Shakir . Reliance is placed on the case of “Muhammad Ashraf 
Vs. The State” ( 2012 S C M R 419) where the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan was pleased to hold as under 
“Both the eye-witnesses are not natural witnesses and they claimed that 
they  had seen the incidence but had failed to explain two injuries 
caused with blunt weapon on the forehead and below the left eye of the 
deceased and had only attributed one  injury to the appellant  at the 
back of his ear.”  
Reliance is also placed on the case  of USMAN alias KALOO Vs. The State 
(2017 S C M R 622) where the august Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased 
to hold as under:-  
“Some of the above mentioned eye-witnesses had maintained that the 
deceased had received only one injury at the hands of the appellant but 
the Post-mortem Examination Report shows that the deceased had 
received as many as 8 injuries on different parts of his body.” 
Reliance is also placed on the case  of Muhammad Hussain Vs. The State (2008 
S C M R 345) where the august Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased to hold 
as under:- 
“Only one fire-arm injury was attributed to Muhammad Hussain 
petitioner but according to the post-mortem report there was another 
injury on the person of deceased caused with blunt weapon.”

24 
 
Guidance is also sought from the principle enunciated by the august Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in the case of “Amin Ali and another Vs. The State” (2011 
SCMR 323) where the august Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased to reject 
the evidence of injured witnesses and held as under:-  
“11. All the three witnesses deposed that the deceased had received 
three injuries, but the Medical Officer found six injuries on the person 
of the deceased. One of them had blackening. None of the witnesses 
deposed that any of the appellants had caused the injuries from a close 
range but on the contrary in the site plan the place of firing has been 
shown 8 feet away from the deceased. Thus from such a distance injury 
with blackening cannot be caused as it can be caused from a distance 
of less than 3 feet as per Modi's Medical Jurisprudence. The Medical 
Officer did not show as to which of the injury was entry or exit wound 
on the person of the deceased. The medical officer stated that metalic 
projectile was recovered from wound No.1/B which was an exit wound. 
If it was an exit wound then the metalic projectile would have been out 
of the body. The presence of metalic projectile in the body clearly 
establishes the fact that it is not an exit wound but an entry wound. The 
medical officer has not shown that any of the injuries had inverted or 
averted margins so as to ascertain as to which of the injuries is entry 
or exit wound. Thus on this count there is a conflict between the medical 
and oral evidence. Furthermore, according to Medical Officer, the 
P.W.15 had four injuries out of them two were entry and two were 
exit wounds but the P.Ws. 13 and 14 deposed that the injured had 
received three injuries. Thus the P.Ws. have shown one exit wound 
as entry wound. With regard to the injured Tanveer Hussain, the 
Medical Officer showed two injuries one entry wound on the chest and 
one exit wound on the back but all the three eye-witnesses deposed that 
P.W.14 had received two injuries on his chest. As regards injuries on 
the person of Mst. Maqbool Bibi. The Medical Officer found one entry 
wound on her back with blackening, whereas P.Ws. 13, 14 and 15 
deposed that the fire shot was fired from the roof of the shop. Entry 
wound with blackening marks cannot be caused from such a long 
distance. From the above position it is manifest that the ocular 
testimony is in conflict with the medical evidence. Thus, the deceased 
and injured did not receive the injuries in the manner, as alleged by the 

Murder Reference No. 09 of 2021

prosecution. 
………………………………. 
13. From the above evidence of the P. Ws., they do not appear to be 
truthful witnesses; therefore, no implicit reliance can be placed on their 
evidence.” 
Reliance is also placed on the case  of Irfan Ali Vs. The State (2015 S C M R 
840) where the august Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased to hold as under:- 
11. The most striking feature of the case is that in the F.I.R. complete 
photographic narration of the entire tragedy has been given so much so, 
Muhammad Khan acquitted accused and the appellant were attributed 
causing specific injuries with the fire shots of 30-bore pistols at the 
deceased. With such degree of accuracy each and every detail of the 
incident was given however, it was not due to mental disorientation that 
the dagger blows inflicted on the deceased found during the autopsy on 
the dead body, could not be noticed by the complainant. This doubt of 
reasonable nature and substance would strongly suggest that the 
complainant and the other eye-witnesses were not present at the spot, 
otherwise, lodging the report after more than 3 hours and spending 1-
1/2 hour at the spot with the dead body, no room was left for this glaring 
omission. This omission is very fatal to the prosecution case and it is 
established that crime was an unwitnessed one”. 
 
17.     We have also noted that the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad 
Rafique (PW-8), Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9), 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) and Muhammad Shafi 
(PW-12) admitted candidly that both the allegedly  injured prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9) and  

Murder Reference No. 09 of 2021

26 
 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) were never taken to any 
hospital for treatment before the arrival of the police at the place of occurrence 
and both the allegedly  injured prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad 
Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9) and  Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah 
Bachayya (PW-11) kept laying at the same place where they had suffered from 
the injuries, in the same injured condition , bleeding from their wounds. The 
prosecution witness namely Muhammad Rafique (PW-8), stated during cross-
examination ,as under:- 
“Police arrived at the spot at 11:45 AM. We did not try to shift injured 
PWS and deceased to any hospital prior to the arrival of police. I did 
not call the ambulance of rescue 1122 for shifting the injured PWS and 
deceased to hospital. We did not wrap any piece of cloth on the injuries c. 
both injured PWs in order to stop the flow of blood. Qasim deceased and 
both injured PWs remained lying at the same place where they sustained 
injuries.” (emphasis supplied)  
Similarly, the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Shafi (PW-12), stated 
during cross-examination, as under:- 
 “I did not call for any ambulance at the spot to shift the injured I even did 
not arrange any vehicle for this purpose. I did not wrap any piece of cloth 
over the wounds. We even did not shift the injured witnesses to any clean 
place. Police reached after 75 minutes after the occurrence. Sohaib Qaiser 
I.O also reached at the spot. When Sohaib Qaiser arrived injured PWs were 
present there.” 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9), during cross-
examination, stated as under:- 

Murder Reference No. 09 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 254 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 729-J of 2017 
Criminal Appeal    No.36 of 2018 
 
 
27 
 
 “We were shifted to RHC 53/M at 01:00 PM. We were shifted through an 
ambulance of rescue emergency 1122. 10/15 minutes after the arrival of 
police, said ambulance reached the spot Till the arrival of ambulance, I 
remained present at the same place where I sustained injuries.” 
(emphasis supplied)  
This conduct of the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Rafique (PW-
8), and Muhammad Shafi (PW-12)  of not taking of the allegedly  injured 
prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya 
(PW-9) and  Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) to any 
hospital for treatment and of Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-
9) and Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11)  of not going to 
any hospital for treatment is much revealing of the doubtful circumstances 
existent in the prosecution case. 
18. 
     We have also noted with grave concern that the prosecution did not 
prove the place of occurrence with any exactitude as neither the blood stained 
earth from the place where the deceased had fallen was collected nor any 
blood stained earth was collected from the places where the allegedly  injured 
prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya 
(PW-9) and  Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) had fallen 
and remained present ,after suffering from the injuries. Initially, Talib Hussain 
57/HC (PW-3)  arrived at the place of occurrence, however, he did not collect 
any blood stained earth and subsequently Shoaib Qaisar, SI (PW-10)  also 
visited the place of occurrence, however, he did too did not collect any blood 
stained earth either from where the deceased had fallen or from the places 
where the allegedly injured prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad 

Murder Reference No. 09 of 2021

28 
 
Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9) and  Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah 
Bachayya (PW-11) had remained present, bleeding. There is no explanation 
as to why the Investigating Officers of the case did not collect any blood-
stained earth. The failure of the Investigating Officers of the case  to collect 
the blood stained earth either from the palce where the deceased had fallen or 
from the places where the allegedly  injured prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9) and  Muhammad Ramzan 
son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) had remained present has consequences, 
entailing that the very place of occurrence was never proved as a fact by the 
prosecution and we cannot,on our own, without any evidence, presume that 
the occurrence  had taken place where it was stated by the prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Rafique (PW-8), Muhammad Ramzan son of 
Allah Wasayya (PW-9), Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya (PW-
11) and Muhammad Shafi (PW-12). 
19.     We have also noted that both the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9) and Muhammad Ramzan 
son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) admitted that their statements were recorded 
with delay by the Investigating Officer of the case during the investigation of 
the case. Both the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan son of 
Allah Wasayya (PW-9) and Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya 
(PW-11), admittedly did not provide any reason for not getting their 
statements recorded with promptitude and why the matter was delayed by 
them. The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah 
Wasayya  (PW-9) admitted that though he had met with Shoaib Qaisar, SI 
(PW-10) , the Investigating Officer of the case , on the very day of occurrence

at the place of occurrence , however, at that time he did not get his statement 
recorded. Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya  (PW-9), admitted 
during cross-examination , as under:- 
“I got recorded my statement to the I.0 after ten days of the occurrence. 
Firstly, Sohaib Qaiser I.O met me at the place of occurrence. At that time 
I did not make any statement before him. ” (emphasis supplied)  
It has not been explained that when Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah 
Wasayya  (PW-9) had met with Shoaib Qaisar, SI (PW-10), the Investigating 
Officer of the case , on the very day of occurrence at the place of occurrence 
then while he did not narrate the details of the occurrence to the Investigating 
Officer of the case  and why he only got his statement recorded after much 
delay. We have also noticed that  the prosecution witness namely Muhammad 
Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya  (PW-9), wrongly stated that he got his 
statement recorded under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
1898 after ten days of the occurrence as according to Shoaib Qaisar, SI (PW-
10) , the Investigating Officer of the case , the statements of the prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9) and  
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) were recorded on 
30.05.2017, i.e after as many as thirty six days  after the occurrence. The 
prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya 
(PW-11) admitted during cross-examination as under:- 
“I 
firstly 
appeared 
before 
the 
I.0 
45/60 
days 
after 
the 
occurrence.”(emphasis supplied)  
Shoaib Qaisar, SI (PW-10) , the Investigating Officer of the case, in his 
statement before the police also stated as under:-

“ On 30.05.2017, I recorded the statements of injured witnesses of this 
case.” 
It is trite that the delayed recording of the statement of a prosecution witness 
under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 reduces its value 
to nothing unless there is plausible explanation for such delay. No 
explanation, much less plausible, has been given by both the prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9) and  
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11), for them not getting 
their statements under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 
recorded immediately and therefore no value can be attached to their 
statements. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Abdul 
Khaliq Vs. The State” (1996 SCMR 1553) has held as under: 
“It is a settled position of law that late recording of 161, Cr.P.C. statement 
of a prosecution witness reduces its value to nill unless there is plausible 
explanation for such delay”.  
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Muhammad Khan Vs. 
Maula Bakhsh” (1998 SCMR 570) has held as under: 
“It is a settled law that credibility of a witness is looked with serious 
suspicion if his statement under section 161, Cr.P.C is recorded with delay 
without offering any plausible explanation”.  
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Syed Saeed Muhammad 
Shah and another Vs. The State” (1993 SCMR 550) at page 571 has held as 
under: 
“In the absence of satisfactory nature of explanation normally rule is that 
statements recorded by police after delay and without explanation are to be

ruled out of consideration. In this case unsatisfactory explanation which is 
not substantiated can be equated with no explanation”.  
20. 
      With regard to the presence of the prosecution witness namely 
Muhammad Rafique (PW-8) we have noticed that his presence at the place of 
occurrence could not be proved. We have noted that according to the 
prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Rafique (PW-8) , Muhammad 
Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9), Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah 
Bachayya (PW-11) and Muhammad Shafi (PW-12), the motive of the 
occurrence was that  the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Rafique 
(PW-8) had a dispute with the appellants over the turn of water. Moreover, 
according to the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Rafique (PW-8) , 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9), Muhammad Ramzan son 
of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) and Muhammad Shafi (PW-12), neither the 
deceased namely Muhammad Qasim nor the injured witnesses namely 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya  (PW-9) and Muhammad Ramzan 
son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) had any dispute with the appellants which 
could have motivated them to commit Qatl-i-Amd of Muhammad Qasim 
(deceased) or attempt to commit their Qatl-i-Amd. The prosecution witness 
namely Muhammad Rafique (PW-8), in his statement before the learned trial 
court stated as under:- 
“It is correct that Qasim deceased did not own any land in Mouza Bohar 
Boghay Shah. Ramzan s/o Allah Bachayya and Ramzan s/o Allah 
Wasayya own land in Mouza Bohar Boghay Shah. Qasim deceased had no 
civil or criminal litigation with Shahbaz accused. It is correct that there 
was no litigation between Shahbaz and Ramzan s/o Allah Wasayya 
prior to the occurrence. It is correct that there was no litigation between

Shahbaz and Ramzan s/o Allah Bachayya prior to the occurrence. Qasim 
deceased was not witness against Shahbaz accused in any case. There 
happened no quarrel or altercation between Shahbaz accused and Qasim 
deceased prior to the occurrence. I did not receive any injury during this 
occurrence It is correct that I filed a suit in civil court Lodhran on 
30.12.2014. declaratory in Volunteered, same is subjudice. It is correct that 
injunctive order was passed on 24.05.2017. It is correct that Qasim 
deceased and both Ramzan injured witnesses are not the parties of said 
suit. It is correct that applications moved by me before the revenue 
authorities against Shahbaz accused were also remained subjudice. It is 
correct that a case FIR No.142/16 dated 26.06.2016 offence u/s 447 PPC 
was got registered by me against Shahbaz accused and Shakir accused at 
police station Gaily Wall. 
            I also forbid the accused persons from breaking the water on the 
day of occurrence. I was standing at a distance of 15/16 feet from the 
accused persons at that time. 
…………… 
Deceased Qasim did not grapple with accused persons rather he 
verbally restrained the accused persons from breaking the water. 
Neither Shahbaz accused nor deceased Qasim abused each other. 
Ramzan s/o Allah Wasayya and Ramzan s/o Allah Bachayya did not 
came forward to restrain the accused persons. Deceased Qasim was 
standing at a distance of 10 feet from accused Shahbaz when sustained fire 
shot

I did not escape from the spot at the time of occurrence rather 
remained 
standing 
there 
till 
the 
departure 
of

persons.”(emphasis supplied)  
Similarly, the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah 
Wasayya  (PW-9) , during cross-examination, stated as under:- 
“ There was no civil or criminal litigation between deceased Qasim and 
accused Shahbaz. There happened no quarrel or altercation between 
Shahbaz accused and deceased Qasim. There was civil and criminal 
litigation pending between Rafique complainant and Shahbaz accused 
prior to the occurrence. Rafique complainant remained present at the spot 
at the time when accused arrived and made firing and did not escape. 
Rafique complainant did not sustain any injury by the hands of accused 
persons. 
5/10 minutes after the arrival of accused persons occurrence of firing took 
place. Raffique complainant restrained the accused persons from breaking 
the water. None of us snatched "Kassi" from the accused persons. We did 
not inquire from the accused the reason for breaking the water. Qasim 
deceased also did not try to snatch "Kassi" or stopped any person. Accused 
did not abuse us. Prior to this occurrence, accused persons present in the 
court did not attack or injured us. I as well as Ramzan s/o Allah Bachayya 
are not the complainant/plaintiff of any case against accused Shahbaz. 
Likewise, Shahbaz accused is also not complainant/plaintiff in any 
case against us.” (emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya 
(PW-11), during cross-examination stated as under:- 
“ There was no litigation or enmity between me and Shahbaz accused. All 
litigations between Rafique complainant and Shahbaz accused. Rafique 

Murder Reference No. 09 of 2021

complainant did not sustain any injury during this occurrence. Even 
there was no quarrel or litigation between Qasim deceased and Shahbaz 
accused.” (emphasis supplied)  
Muhammad Shafi (PW-12), during cross-examination , stated as under:- 
“There is old standing litigation between Rafique complainant and Shahbaz 
accused prior to the occurrence. There was no dispute regarding water 
between us and accused Shahbaz prior to the occurrence. Shahbaz 
accused never attacked upon me or other witnesses prior to the occurrence. 
Rafique complainant did not sustain even a scratch during this 
occurrence. ” (emphasis supplied)  
In these circumstances, the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Rafique 
(PW-8) should have been the prime target of the assailants. Furthermore, 
according to the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Rafique (PW-8) , 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9), Muhammad Ramzan son 
of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) and Muhammad Shafi (PW-12),  the prosecution 
witness namely Muhammad Rafique (PW-8)  was in clear view, at a meagre 
distance, from the assailants and unarmed whereas the accused  were allegedly 
armed with various firearm weapons. Neither there was any dearth of 
ammunition nor that of intent and opportunity on part of the appellants or their 
co-accused for not doing away with the prosecution witness namely 
Muhammad Rafique (PW-8), their main adversary, who, at the time of 
occurrence,  was present at the place of occurrence and there did not exist any 
obstacle in the line of the sight of the accused and the place where the 
prosecution witness namely Muhammad Rafique (PW-8)  was present . In this 
scenario, it is hard to believe that the prosecution witness namely Muhammad 
Rafique (PW-8)   would have been shown the courtesy of being not fired at 

Murder Reference No. 09 of 2021

all, when Muhammad Rafique (PW-8) should have been the prime target of 
the assailants . In the midst of firing by so many accused persons, the 
prosecution witness namely Muhammad Rafique (PW-8) did not receive even 
a single scratch on his body during the whole occurrence. If the prosecution 
witness namely Muhammad Rafique (PW-8) had been present in the view of 
the assailants, then  he would not have been spared. Blessing the prosecution 
witness namely Muhammad Rafique (PW-8) with such an incredible 
consideration and showing him such favour, the person with whom the 
assailants had a direct dispute with, is implausible and opposed to the natural 
behaviour of any accused. Such behaviour, on part of the accused as deposed 
by the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Rafique (PW-8), 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9), Muhammad Ramzan son 
of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) and Muhammad Shafi (PW-12) runs counter to 
natural human conduct and behaviour. Article 129 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat 
Order, 1984 allows the courts to presume the existence of any fact, which it 
thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of 
natural events and human conduct in relation to the facts of the particular case. 
We  thus trust the existence of this fact, by virtue of the Article 129 of the 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, that the conduct of the assailants, as deposed 
to by the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Rafique (PW-8), 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9), Muhammad Ramzan son 
of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) and Muhammad Shafi (PW-12), was opposed to 
the common course of natural events and human conduct. Hence, we are 
holding that the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Rafique (PW-8) did 
not witness the occurrence. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in its 

Murder Reference No. 09 of 2021

Criminal Appeal    No. 729-J of 2017

binding judgments has repeatedly held that in a scenario where the motivation 
was against the complainant or the witnesses but the accused did not cause 
any harm to them, notwithstanding being within the range of their firing, 
would reveal that the said witnesses  had not witnessed the occurrence. The 
august Supreme Court of Pakistan in case Tariq Mehmood v. The State and 
others (2019 SCMR 1170) has observed as under: 
“First sight cannot escape preponderance of evidence, however on a closer 
view, emerges a picture incompatible with the events, narrated in the crime 
report. The accused mounted assault, as per prosecution's own case to settle 
score with Muhammad Usman, PW for his alleged affair with the lady 
related to the appellant; it is disgrace that brought the assailants, face to 
face, with Muhammad Usman, PW, well within their view and reach it is 
astonishing that while being merciless without restraint upon others they 
spared prime target of assault. There can be no other inference that either 
Muhammad Usman was not present at the scene or the occurrence took place 
in a backdrop other than asserted in the crime report.” 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in case Rohtas Khan v. The State (2010 
SCMR 566) at page 571 observed as under: 
“The alleged motive was against the complainant, but it is noted that the 
appellant did not cause any injury to the complainant, though he was present 
within the range of firing, thus it supports the contention of the learned 
counsel of appellant that P.Ws. were not present at the place of occurrence.”  
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Muhammad Farooq & 
another v. The State (2006 SCMR 1707) at page 1712 held as under:- 
“Had P.W.9 been present on the spot, he was not likely to be spared because 
the number of injuries on the person of deceased show that at least eighteen 
rounds were fired. It only shows the degree of venom the killer had for the 
deceased.”

We are also guided by the binding judgment of the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan passed in the case of Mst. Rukhsana Begum & others v. Sajjad & 
others (2017 SCMR 596) where at page 601 it was observed as under:- 
“Another intriguing aspect of the matter is that, according to the F.I.R., all 
the accused encircled the complainant, the PWs and the two deceased thus, 
the apparent object was that none could escape alive. The complainant being 
father of the two deceased and the head of the family was supposed to be the 
prime target. In fact he has vigorously pursued the case against the accused 
and also deposed against them as an eye witness. The site plan positions 
would show that, he and the other P.W.s were at the mercy of the assailants 
but being the prime target even no threat was extended to him. Blessing him 
with unbelievable courtesy and mercy shown to him by the accused knowing 
well that he and the witnesses would depose against them by leaving them 
unhurt, is absolutely unbelievable story. Such behavior, on the part of the 
accused runs counter to natural human conduct and behavior explained in 
the provision of Article 129 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, Order 1984, 
therefore, the court is unable to accept such unbelievable proposition.” 
 
21. 
With regard to the value of the statement of the prosecution witness 
namely Muhammad Shafi (PW-12), suffice it to observe that according to the 
statements of the witnesses themselves, Muhammad Shafi (PW-12) had 
arrived at the place of occurrence after the occurrence had been completed. 
The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Shafi (PW-12), though 
attempted to claim that he had arrived at the place of occurrence prior to the 
occurrence, however, was duly confronted with his previous statement and 
was exposed to having made blatant and dishonest improvements in this 
regard. During the course of cross-examination of Muhammad Shafi (PW-
12), the learned trial court observed as under:-

“ I did not state before the 1.0 in my statement that I along with Azam PW 
reached the spot on hearing the noise of firing. Confronted with Ex.D-A 
where it is so recorded.”(emphasis supplied)  
Even  Shoaib Qaisar, SI (PW-10) , the Investigating Officer of the case , made 
a statement before the learned trial court that Muhammad Shafi (PW-12) had 
arrived at the place of occurrence after the occurrence had been completed 
and stated as under:- 
“It is correct that Pws Azam and Shafi stated in their statements that they 
attracted at the place of occurrence, after hearing the fire shots. ” 
22. 
The learned Deputy Prosecutor General along with the learned counsel 
for the complainant, have relied upon the recovery of the pistol (P-16) and 
two live bullets (P-17 and P-18) from the appellant namely Muhammad Shakir 
son of Nazar Muhammad and the recovery of the pistol (P-19) and two live 
bullets (P-20 and P-21) from the appellant namely  Muhammad Shahbaz son 
of Syed Shabbir Hussain Shah  and the reports of the Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore (Exh. P.Z. and Exh.PZ/1) and have submitted that they 
offered sufficient corroboration of the ocular account of the occurrence as 
furnished by the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Rafique (PW-8), 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya (PW-9), Muhammad Ramzan son 
of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) and Muhammad Shafi (PW-12). The recovery of 
the pistol (P-16) and two live bullets (P-17 and P-18) from the appellant 
namely Muhammad Shakir son of Nazar Muhammad and the recovery of the 
pistol (P-19) and two live bullets (P-20 and P-21) from the appellant namely  
Muhammad Shahbaz son of Syed Shabbir Hussain Shah cannot be relied upon 
as the Investigating Officer of the case did not join any witness of the locality

during the recovery of the pistol (P-16) and two live bullets (P-17 and P-18) 
from the appellant namely Muhammad Shakir son of Nazar Muhammad and 
the recovery of the pistol (P-19) and two live bullets (P-20 and P-21) from the 
appellant namely  Muhammad Shahbaz son of Syed Shabbir Hussain Shah 
which action of his was in clear violation of the provisions of the section 103 
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 and therefore the evidence of the recovery 
of the pistol (P-16) and two live bullets (P-17 and P-18) from the appellant 
namely Muhammad Shakir son of Nazar Muhammad and the recovery of the 
pistol (P-19) and two live bullets (P-20 and P-21) from the appellant namely  
Muhammad Shahbaz son of Syed Shabbir Hussain Shah cannot be used as 
incriminating evidence against the appellants, being evidence which was 
obtained through illegal means and hence hit by the exclusionary rule of 
evidence. The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah 
Wasayya  (PW-9) admitted during cross-examination as under:- 
“ No Lumberdar or councilor etc was called by the I.O. We reached at the 
place of recovery at 03:30 PM. Place of recovery is deserted place. Place of 
recovery is an open place.” (emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Shafi (PW-12), during cross-
examination admitted as under:- 
“ Before recovery of pistol from the accused Shakir I did not see him to 
conceal it at the place of recovery. The recovery place is situated at 
No.18/MPR. No person of locality from the place of recovery cited as a 
witness.” (emphasis supplied)  
Shoaib Qaisar, SI (PW-10), the Investigating Officer of the case, during cross-
examination  admitted as under:-

“The place of recovery related to accused Shehbaz is at a distance of 3/4 
acre from the place of occurrence. No person of vicinity was joined in the 
recovery proceedings. Volunteered no one was willing to join the same. I 
have not given anything in my case file regarding said denial. Place of 
recovery was an open place i.e bargad tree which was easily accessible 
but the same was less visited place. 
………….. 
The place of recovery related to accused Shakir is at a distance of 800 to 
1000 meters from the place of occurrence. The place of recovery is state 
land. I had not taken into possession any motorcycle on which the accused 
persons fled away after the occurrence. No person of vicinity i.e chairman, 
lumberdar etc was joined in the recovery proceedings. ” (emphasis 
supplied)  
 The provisions of section 103 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, 
unfortunately, are honoured more in disuse than compliance. To appreciate 
it better, this section is being reproduced:- 
"103.--(1) Before making a search. under this chapter, the 
officer or other person about to make it shall call upon two 
or more respectable inhabitants of the locality in which 
the place to be searched is situate to attend and witness 
the search and may issue an order in writing to them or 
any of them so to do. 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Muhammad Ismail and 
others Vs. The State” (2017 SCMR 898) at page 901 has held as under:- 
“For the above mentioned recovery of weapons the prosecution had 
failed to associate any independent witness of the locality and, thus, the 
mandatory provisions of section 103, Cr.P.C. had flagrantly been 
violated in that regard.”

In this manner, the recovery of the pistol (P-16) and two live bullets (P-17 and 
P-18) from the appellant namely Muhammad Shakir son of Nazar Muhammad 
and the recovery of the pistol (P-19) and two live bullets (P-20 and P-21) from 
the appellant namely  Muhammad Shahbaz son of Syed Shabbir Hussain Shah 
could not be proved and cannot be considered as a relevant fact for proving 
any fact in issue.  
23. 
The learned Deputy Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the 
complainant have also relied upon the evidence of motive and submitted that 
it corroborated the ocular account. The motive behind the occurrence of this 
case, as stated by the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Rafique (PW-
8) , in his written application (Exh. P.B) was that there was dispute between 
the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Rafique (PW-8) and the 
appellants over the watering of the lands. A perusal of the prosecution 
evidence reveals that Muhammad Rafique (PW-8) miserably failed to lead 
any evidence in order to prove the motive due to which the occurrence took 
place. Muhammad Rafique (PW-8) , admitted during cross-examination that 
he did not produce any documentary evidence to prove that it was his turn to 
water the land when the occurrence took place and admitted during cross-
examination as under:- 
“I do not know about existence of any matter concerning dispute of water 
pending before irrigation authority. I did not get register any FIR or 
complaint against accused Shahbaz about theft of water prior to the 
occurrence. It is correct that I did not produce any proof of turn of water 
allegedly belonging to the investigating officer ” (emphasis supplied)

Shoaib Qaisar, SI (PW-10), the Investigating Officer of the case, also admitted 
during cross-examination that the motive of the occurrence could not be 
proved and no evidence was produced before him or collected by him in proof 
of the motive. Shoaib Qaisar, SI (PW-10), the Investigating Officer of the 
case, stated during cross-examination as under:- 
“The motive behind the occurrence was stated by the complainant in the 
FIR was dispute over irrigation. No such material was provided by the 
complainant to me which could have suggested the existence of such 
dispute. They had not produced any document regard Warabandi 
regarding irrigation. I had not collected any evidence whether on the day 
of occurrence, the complainant had his turn of water. The stipulated time 
regarding dispute was not mentioned by the witnesses, however, they stated 
that a dispute was between them. I had also not collected any document 
from concern irrigation authority about warabandi of said place. I had not 
collected any document regarding the ownership of land where the 
occurrence took place. Apart from complainant and Pws, I had not recorded 
statement of any person of vicinity regarding the dispute between the 
parties. I had neither drawn any inference regarding the motive of the 
occurrence nor collected any evidence in this regard. ”(emphasis supplied)  
 
As mentioned above, according to the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Rafique (PW-8) , Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya 
(PW-9), Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) and 
Muhammad Shafi (PW-12), neither the deceased namely Muhammad Qasim 
nor the injured witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya  
(PW-9) and Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11) had any 
dispute with the appellants which could have motivated them to commit the

Qatl-i-Amd of Muhammad Qasim (deceased) or attempt to commit Qatl-i-
Amd of Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya  (PW-9) and Muhammad 
Ramzan son of Allah Bachayya (PW-11). The above referred portions of the 
statements of the prosecution witnesses clearly prove that the prosecution 
witnesses failed to provide evidence enabling us to determine the truthfulness 
of the motive alleged, and the fact that the said motive was so compelling that 
it could have led the appellants, namely Muhammad Shakir son of Nazar 
Muhammad and Muhammad Shahbaz son of Syed Shabbir Hussain Shah to 
have committed the Qatl-i-Amd of the deceased or attempted to  have 
committed the Qatl-i-Amd  of the injured witnesses namely Muhammad 
Ramzan son of Allah Wasayya  (PW-9) and Muhammad Ramzan son of Allah 
Bachayya (PW-11).There are haunting contradictions with regard to the 
minutiae of motive alleged. No independent witness was produced by the 
prosecution to prove the motive as alleged. Moreover, it is an admitted rule of 
appreciation of evidence that motive is only a corroborative piece of evidence 
and if the ocular account is found to be unreliable, then motive alone cannot 
be made the basis of conviction. Even otherwise, a tainted piece of evidence 
cannot corroborate another tainted piece of evidence. Reliance in this regard 
is placed on the case of Muhammad Javed v. The State (2016 SCMR 2021) . 
 
24. 
Considering all the above circumstances, we entertain serious doubt in 
our minds regarding the involvement of the appellants namely Muhammad 
Shakir son of Nazar Muhammad and Muhammad Shahbaz son of Syed 
Shabbir Hussain Shah in the present case. It is a settled principle of law that 
for giving the benefit of the doubt it is not necessary that there should be so

many circumstances rather if only a single circumstance creating reasonable 
doubt in the mind of a prudent person is available then such benefit is to be 
extended to an accused not as a matter of concession but as of right. The 
august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Muhammad Mansha Vs. The 
State” (2018 SCMR 772) has enunciated the following principle: 
“Needless to mention that while giving the benefit of doubt to an 
accused it is not necessary that there should be many circumstances 
creating doubt. If there is a circumstance which creates reasonable 
doubt in a prudent mind about the guilt of the accused, then the 
accused would be entitled to the benefit of such doubt, not as a 
matter of grace and concession, but as a matter of right. It is based 
on the maxim, "it is better that ten guilty persons be acquitted rather 
than one innocent person be convicted". Reliance in this behalf can 
be made upon the cases of Tariq Pervez v. The State (1995 SCMR 
1345), Ghulam Qadir and 2 others v. The State (2008 SCMR 1221), 
Muhammad Akramv.The State (2009 SCMR 230) and Muhammad 
Zamanv.The State (2014 SCMR 749).” 
 
Reliance is also placed on the judgment of the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan Najaf Ali Shah Vs. the State (2021 S C M R 736) in which it has 
been observed as infra: 
“9. 
Mere heinousness of the offence if not proved to the hilt is 
not a ground to avail the majesty of the court to do complete 
justice. This is an established principle of law and equity that it 
is better that 100 guilty persons should let off but one innocent 
person should not suffer. As the preeminent English jurist William 
Blackstone wrote, "Better that ten guilty persons escape, than 
that one innocent suffer." Benjamin Franklin, who was one of the 
leading figures of early American history, went further arguing 
"it is better a hundred guilty persons should escape than one 
innocent person should suffer." All the contradictions noted by 
the learned High Court are sufficient to cast a shadow of doubt 
on the prosecution's case, which entitles the petitioner to the right 
of benefit of the doubt. It is a well settled principle of law that for 
the accused to be afforded this right of the benefit of the doubt it 
is not necessary that there should be many circumstances 
creating uncertainty and if there is only one doubt, the benefit of 
the same must got to the petitioner. This Court in the case of Mst. 
Asia Bibi v. The State (PLD 2019 SC 64) while relying on the the 
earlier judgments of We have categorically held that "if a single 
circumstance creates reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about 
the apprehension of guilt of an accused, then he/she shall be 
entitled to such benefit not as a matter of grace and concession, 
but as of right. Reference in this regard may be made to the cases 
of Tariq Pervaiz v. The State (1998 SCMR 1345) and Ayub Masih 
v. The State (PLD 2002 SC 1048)." The same view was reiterated

in Abdul Jabbar v. State (2010 SCMR 129) when this court 
observed that once a single loophole is observed in a case 
presented by the prosecution, such as conflict in the ocular 
account and medical evidence or presence of eye-witnesses being 
doubtful, the benefit of such loophole/lacuna in the prosecution's 
case automatically goes in favour of an accused.”
