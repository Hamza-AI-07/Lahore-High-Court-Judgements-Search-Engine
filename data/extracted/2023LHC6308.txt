ASIM HAFEEZ, J. Instant Execution Appeal (‘Appeal’) is directed 
against orders dated 19.01.2023 and 23.01.2023. In terms of order of 
23.01.2023, learned Judge Banking Court (‘Banking Court’), for the 
reasons recorded therein, declared allotment in favour of appellant 
void, upon invoking section 23 of the Financial Institutions (Recovery 
of Finances) Ordinance, 2001(‘FIO’). Banking Court further directed 
respondent No.1 [decree holder-cum-mortgagee] to redeem subject 
matter property to the respondents No.2 and 3 [judgment debtors-
cum-mortgagor] and deliver possession thereof. And through order 
of 19.01.2023, various applications of the appellant were dismissed 
by the Banking Court, having the effect of denying alleged rights 
claimed by the appellant. 

E.F.A No. 8251 of 2023

2. 
Facts, essential for adjudication of appeal, are that property 
bearing plot No.24/B, SIE-II, PSIC, Gujranwala, measuring 2-Kanals 
(“property”), was leased to the respondents No.2 by respondent 
No.8 - [Punjab Small Industries Corporation] - (“lessor”) on terms 
contained in the lease deed dated 25.01.1988, conferring lease hold 
rights, which rights were then mortgaged by respondent No.2 
(“lessee”) with respondent No.1 on 08.02.1998, by way of mortgage 
by way of deposit of title deed - [term of lease was for 99 years with 
option of renewal] - for securing repayment of Mark-up based 
facility, extended by the respondent No.1. 
 
On 08.04.1999, respondent No.1 sued respondents No.2 to 7 
for the recovery of claim before the Banking Court. On 24.01.2002 
lessor cancelled the lease hold rights. Recovery suit was decreed on 
21.02.2002. On 13.06.2002, lessor filed objections and sought de-
attachment of property, which objections were dismissed on 
08.01.2004, and application of the respondent No.1 [decree holder-
cum-Financial Institution] for grant of possession was allowed. 
Reportedly the possession was delivered to respondent No.1. Lessor, 
notwithstanding dismissal of objections, proceeded to auction the 
property, whereupon allotment letter was issued to the appellant on 
15.03.2004. Appellant started asserting rights qua property, based on 
letter of allotment, and, at one point in time, sought permission to 
deposit the decretal amount, which request was declined by Banking 
Court. Appellant preferred EFA No.68179/2020, which appeal was 
disposed of on 13.09.2022, in following terms, 

E.F.A No. 8251 of 2023 
3 
 
“After arguing the case at some length, learned counsel for parties 
agreed that the judgment debtor will deposit the entire decretal amount 
with the decree holder bank within a period of 30 days, after which the 
decree holder bank will redeem and return the mortgaged property / 
plot subject to determination by learned executing court, at the first 
instance, that to whom said mortgaged property is to be returned, 
considering the relevant record as well as provision of section 23 of 
Financial Institution (Recovery of Finances) Ordnance, 2001, and hearing 
all concerned. The said exercise shall be done by learned executing court 
preferably within a period of two months from the date of entire 
decretal amount be paid by the judgment debtor to the decree holder 
bank.” 
[Emphasis supplied] 
 
3. 
Respondents No.2 and 3, after order of 13.09.2022, satisfied 
the decree in full by making payment on 10.10.2022, whereafter 
Banking Court proceeded to pass the orders hereby assailed. 
4. 
Learned counsel for the appellant contends that lease hold 
rights extended to lessee were cancelled, whereafter property stood 
allotted to the appellant, and such subsequent transaction was a 
valid transaction, which could at best be subjected to the mortgage 
charge, and appellant had shown willingness to satisfy decree. Adds 
that section 23 of the FIO is not attracted since the lessor, in this 
case, was neither the customer nor mortgagor, or for that matter the 
judgment debtor. Submits that executing court has no jurisdiction to 
entertain and adjudicate disputes touching cancellation of lease and 
consequent allotment of property to the appellant once decree was 
adjusted. Lastly submits that evidence needed to be recorded for the 
determination of controversial issues on the pattern of an inquiry 
envisaged under the provisions of Order XXI Rule (58) of Code of Civil 
Procedure 1908. Learned counsel refers to following decisions to 
support submissions, reported as “Mst. Farhat Fareed Sheikh Vs. NIB

Conversely, learned counsel appearing for respondents No.2 
and 3 submits that lessee, being the mortgagor, has exercised right 
redemption and satisfied the decree. Adds that respondents No.2 
and 3 stepped in the shoes of the respondent No.1 / mortgagee, and 
same are entitled to have possession of property. Adds that 
allotment letter was issued after the passing of the decree, hence, 

E.F.A No. 8251 of 2023

transaction is void in terms of section 23 of the FIO. Following 
decisions are referred to support submissions, “The Bank of Punjab Vs. 
Messrs Magic River Services and 4 others” (2016 CLD 171), “Haji Dad

Learned counsel for the respondent No.8 pleaded against the 
orders impugned and emphasized on issue of cancellation of lease. 
Respondent No.1 is a satisfied decree holder.

Indubitably, through order of 08.01.2004 Banking Court 
crystalized the scope of rights of the parties and prescribed 
limitations qua exercise of those rights, while dismissing objections 
filed by the lessor against incidence of the attachment of property – 
conspicuously conduct of auction sale and issuance of allotment 
letter happened after the order of 08.01.2004. It is expedient to 
reproduce operative part of order of 08.01.2004, 
There is no denial to the fact that Plot No.24/B situated at SIE-
11, PSIC, Gujranwala is owned by the Punjab Small Industries 
Corporation, the objector/petitioner. It had been leased-out to the 
judgment debtor vide lease deed dated 25-01-1988. As per clause 3 of 
the said agreement, the lessor i.e. Punjab Small Industries Corporation 
had given the rights of lease to the judgment debtor which mortgaged 
it to the Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan in lieu of loan for 
industrial purposes. It was made clear in the said agreement that in case 
the judgment debtor obtained loan from any institution other than 
Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan, the decree holder, the lessee 
judgment debtor M/s Seven Aays Enterprises would be under a legal 
obligation to obtain prior written consent from the lessor. The judgment 
debtor had obtained finance facility from the decree holder by 
mortgaging the said plot which, factually, was owned by the 

E.F.A No. 8251 of 2023 
6 
 
petitioner/objector whereas, it had granted the rights of lease only. The 
title of the mortgaged property, since vested with the objector and the 
judgment debtor being lessor only, was not competent to mortgage title 
of the same to the decree holder, the property cannot be put to auction, 
but there is no hurdle whatsoever in transfer of lease hold rights of the 
lessee to any person through auction by the court. The objection petition 
being baseless and misconceived is dismissed. However, it is made clear 
that decree holder bank shall dispose of only that right to satisfy the 
decree of this court which had been mortgaged against the loan. To be 
more clear, it is observed that the decree holder would not be 
competent to dispose of the plot but the lease hold rights of the 
judgment debtor only. 
[Emphasis supplied] 
8. 
Rights allegedly claimed by the appellant, based on letter of 
allotment dated 15.03.2004, were subject to the mandate of order of 
08.01.2004 – at the time of allotment lease hold rights in the 
property were mortgaged and otherwise under attachment. Key 
takeaway of order dated 08.01.2004 was the prioritization of the 
mortgage charge and reiteration of inherently vested proprietary 
right of the lessor. Notably, before order of 08.01.2004, lessor had 
allegedly cancelled the lease, however no determination was carried 
out regarding legality or otherwise of the order of cancellation of 
lease. It was quite logical to defer the determination of cancellation 
of the lease in the wake of outstanding decree and enforceable 
mortgage charge. However, situation has changed after the 
satisfaction of the decree. Applicability of section 23 of the FIO need 
to be examined in the context of satisfaction of decree and 
redemption of lease hold rights. Learned counsel for respondents 
No.2 and 3 pleaded that same had stepped in the shoes of the 
mortgagee bank, upon redeeming the property. This assertion is 
misconceived. Dealing with or disposal of mortgaged property to the 

E.F.A No. 8251 of 2023 
7 
 
third party by the mortgagee, either in exercise of right of 
foreclosure or upon auction sale by the executing court must not be 
confused with the voluntary redemption of mortgage charge by the 
mortgagor-cum-lessee. In the context of this case, we are dealing 
with later scenario. Despite redemption of lease hold rights the 
status of respondent No.2 remained as a lessee, and only difference 
was satisfaction of the decree. This aspect escaped attention of the 
Banking Court, which otherwise proceeded to decide legality of the 
allotment of appellant without appreciating that before such 
determination the legality of the order of cancellation of lease needs 
adjudication. Banking Court essentially failed to construe the context 
and effect of order of 08.01.2004. After satisfaction of the decree 
and redemption of lease hold rights Banking Court has no jurisdiction 
to decide validity of order of cancellation of lease and / or rights 
consequently claimed by the appellant. 
9. 
We take up the issue of applicability of sub-section (2) of 
section 23 of the FIO, since respondents No.2 and 3 attacked 
allotment on the plea that allotment letter was issued after the 
passing of the decree by the Banking Court and transaction otherwise 
succeeded order of 08.01.2004. Composite reading of sub-sections to 
section 23 of the FIO manifests the objectivity intended for 
protecting the interest of the mortgagee or other categories of 
charge holder(s) described therein. Section 23 of the FIO defines, 
limits and restricts the exercise of rights by the customer or the 
judgment debtor, as situation warrants, with respect to the property 

E.F.A No. 8251 of 2023 
8 
 
/ asset(s) under mortgage / charge / encumbrance. There is no cavil 
that sub-section (2) of section 23 of the FIO is relevant and attracted 
so long the decree is outstanding or the mortgage / charge / 
encumbrance is enforceable, depending upon the facts in each case. 
Under sub-section (2) of section 23 of the FIO, element of voidness is 
attributed to the transaction, through legal fiat, for the purpose of 
protecting, preserving and safeguarding the rights and entitlement of 
the respondent No.1 - decree holder. Once decree was adjusted in 
full, question of voidness of the alleged transaction would become 
irrelevant for the decree holder, and at that point in time jurisdiction 
of the Bank Court ends. Position is explained with an illustration. 
Assumingly, A is the decree holder, B the judgment debtor. Property 
belonging to B, is subject of mortgage charge. If B executes an 
agreement to sell with C the transaction is void and not enforceable 
against B, in wake of an outstanding decree, since transaction had 
prejudiced A [decree holder]. But if decree stood fully satisfied, 
whether transaction between B and C could still be held void to the 
disadvantage of C, who, once satisfaction of the decree is certified by 
the Banking Court, will be entitled to claim enforceability of the 
transaction claimed before the courts of plenary jurisdiction. Either C 
claims enforcement of alleged transaction with the judgment debtor 
or not but certainly Banking Court is not vested with the jurisdiction 
to adjudicate dispute between B and C, in absence of an outstanding 
decree – in such scenario why would the decree holder in first place 
object to the transaction and press for declaration of voidness. 

E.F.A No. 8251 of 2023 
9 
 
Creation of a third party rights by way of auction sale by the Banking 
Court in execution of decree or the sale of mortgage property by 
resorting to section 15 of the FIO or Sale in exercise of right of 
foreclosure is another matter, which is not the position here 
[appellant is not claiming any right from the decree holder].  
  
According to the facts of the case at hand, question of 
determination of voidness of allotment, upon satisfaction of the 
decree, falls outside the jurisdiction of Banking Court. And sub-
section (2) of section 23 of the FIO has no application. Once decree 
stood satisfied the effect of attachment order would also disappear. 
Lessor, lessee and allottee each are at liberty to plead, raise or 
agitate their respective claims before the courts having general 
jurisdiction. It is apparent from the record that possession was taken 
from the lessee and delivered to the decree holder bank in terms of 
order of 08.01.2004, lessee is entitled to have possession upon 
redemption of lease hold rights. This arrangement is subject to the 
terms of the lease deed and determination of the legality of the 
order of cancellation of lease – certainly the rights claimed by the 
appellant is subject to the determination of the issue of legality of 
order of cancellation of lease.  Judgments referred are not relevant 
and applicable qua the facts of the case.  
10. 
Before summing up the decision, we deem it appropriate to 
amplify the context of the order of 13.09.2022. At the time of passing 
of said order in EFA No.68179/2020, the decree was outstanding and 
in that context observations qua the effect of section 23 of the FIO 

E.F.A No. 8251 of 2023 
10 
 
were recorded but before stage of determination reaches the decree 
stood adjusted / satisfied and lease hold rights were redeemed. At 
that point Banking Court stands divested of the jurisdiction to invoke 
section 23 of the FIO, in the context of the facts of this case. 
11. 
This appeal is allowed to the extent that declaration of 
voidness of the allotment in favour of appellant is set-aside. It is 
observed that lessor, lessee and allottee shall be at liberty to seek 
remedies available in law for enforcement of respective claims, 
without being prejudiced by observations in the orders impugned. 
We direct that process of redemption of property shall be completed 
and possession of the property be delivered to the lessee. We allow 
thirty days to the lessee to challenge the factum of order of 
cancellation of lease, failing which lessor shall be at liberty to invoke 
the remedies available against the lessee. The appellant may join the 
proceedings, if advised. Respondent No.8 would be at liberty to seek 
enforcement of order of cancellation of lease or exercise rights 
available under the terms of the lease deed, if so advised. No order 
as to the costs.
