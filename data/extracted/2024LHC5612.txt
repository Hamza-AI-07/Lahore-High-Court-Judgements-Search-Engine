CH. MUHAMMAD IQBAL, J:- 
Through this 
civil revision, the petitioners have challenged the validity 
of judgment & decree dated 28.07.2011, passed by the 
learned Civil Judge, Samundri, who accepted the 
application under Section 12(2) CPC filed by respondents 
No.1 to 6 and also assailed the judgment & decree dated 
28.11.2012 passed by the learned Addl. District Judge, 
Samundri, District Faisalabad who dismissed the appeal 
of the petitioners.  
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that Capt. Nasir Ali 
Shah, Razia Khatoon and Anwar Ali Shah were allottee 
owners of total land measuring 303 Kanals 4 Marlas 
situated in Chak No.47GB Tehsil Samundari District 
Faisalabad fully described in the headnote as well as in

para 1 of the application under Section 12(2) CPC. The 
above said allottees/ owners allegedly executed a General 
Power of Attorney in favour of Maqbool Ahmad son of 
Sultan Bakhsh Gujjar. The said General Attorney entered 
into an agreement of sale of the above said land with his 
real brother Mushtaq Ahmad son of Sultan Bakhsh. 
Thereafter the said general attorney also executed an 
arbitration agreement on 18.07.1988 for settlement of 
controversy and appointed Ch. Maqbool Hussain, 
Advocate as an Arbitrator who passed an award dated 
12.11.1988. After securing the award, petitioner No.1/ 
Mushtaq Ahmad filed an application under Sections 14 & 
17 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, for making the award as 
rule of court. In the said proceedings, the arbitrator Ch. 
Maqbool Hussain, Advocate made a statement on 
30.04.1989 and trial court while accepting the application 
made the award dated 12.11.1988 as rule of court vide 
order dated 30.04.1989. The above said decree was got 
implemented in the Revenue Record through mutation 
No.620, 621 and 622 dated 26.06.1990. 
 
On 07.06.2007 respondents No.1 to 6 filed an 
application under Section 12 (2) CPC for setting aside the 
order dated 30.04.1989 on the ground that the impugned 
General Power of Attorney in favour of Maqbool Ahmad, 
agreement of sale of the land, agreement for arbitration, 

Civil Revision No.525/2013

passing of award by the arbitrator as well as making of 
award as rule of the court are result of fraud 
misrepresentation, fabrication as the original owner of 
the land had died much before the passing of ward as 
well as making of award rule of the court as such same 
are liable to be set aside. Petitioner contested the said 
application by filing written reply on legal and factual 
parlances. The trial court after framing the issues and 
recording the evidence of both the parties accepted the 
said application under Section 12(2) CPC vide judgment 
& decree dated 28.07.2011. Being dejected petitioner 
filed an appeal which was dismissed by the appellate 
court vide judgment & decree dated 28.11.2012. Hence, 
this civil revision.   
3. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
4.  
The core controversy revolves around issue No.4 
which is as under:- 
Whether the order and decree dated 30.04.1989 
passed by Mushtaq Ahmad learned Civil judge, 
Samundri is null and void, based on fraud, 
ineffective and inoperative upon the rights of the 
applicants and liable to be cancelled? OPA 
The suit property was owned by Captain Nasir Ali 
Shah and Anwar Ali Shah as well as Razia Khatoon. 
As per death certificate (Ex.A6) Razia Khatoon died on 
30.08.1987 and Syed Nasir Ali Shah died on 

Civil Revision No.525/2013 
4 
 
 
16.01.1979 as evinces from his death certificate 
(Exh.A7), whereas Anwar Ali Shah died on 13.12.1985 
as reflected from his death certificate (Exh.A8). As per 
statement of Waris Ali (AW-1) and Liaqat Ali (AW-2) 
oral as well as documentary evidence proves the 
arbitration agreement dated 18.07.1988 (Exh.A4) and 
the alleged arbitration award dated 12.11.1988 
(Exh.A5) were fraudulently got prepared by Mushtaq 
Ahmad being collusive with his brother Ch. Maqbool 
Ahmad (Attorney) after the death of owners on the 
basis of general attorney allegedly issued by the said 
owners (Syed Nasir Ali Shah, Anwar Ali Shah and 
Syeda Razia Khatoon) but after the death of the 
aforementioned principals, the general power of 
attorney by operation of law became redundant and 
thereafter any transaction made by the said general 
power of attorney on the basis of said defunct 
instrument (General Power of Attorney) that would be 
considered as void, illegal and fraudulent in nature. 
Even otherwise, all the proceedings including the 
arbitration agreement and arbitration decision were 
initiated against the dead persons. It is settled law that a 
suit or proceeding initiated against a dead person are 
nullity in the eyes of law and such flaw in itself is not 
curable defect. Reliance is placed on the cases titled as 

Civil Revision No.525/2013 
5 
 
 
Hafiz Brothers (Pvt.) Ltd. & Others Vs Messrs Pakistan 
Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation Ltd. (2001 
SCMR 1), Muhammad Yar (deceased) through LRs & 
Others Vs. Muhammad Amin (deceased) through LRs & 
Others (2013 SCMR 464), Farzand Ali & Another Vs 
Khuda Bakhsh & Others (PLD 2015 SC 187). Further 
reliance is placed on a case cited as Ch. Muhammad 
Tufail Khan alias Tufaul Muhammad through Legal 
Representatives Vs Zari Taraqiati Bank Limited through 
Branch Manager (PLD 2007 Lahore 180) (D.B), 
wherein learned Division Bench of this Court held as 
under:- 
“In answer to the first part of the question, it may be 
held that according to the settled law, any suit or the 
legal proceedings, instituted against a dead person 
are nullity in law and in this behalf, we are fortified 
by the judgment of the Honourable Supreme Court, 
reported as Hafiz Brothers (Pvt.) Ltd. and others v. 
Messrs Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment 
Corporation Ltd. 2001 SCMR 1, which declares as 
follows:- 
“There is no cavil with the proposition that the 
institution of legal proceedings against dead 
person is of no avail to the concerned litigant. 
The learned High Court rightly came to the 
conclusion that the suit of PICIC against 
deceased-Mst. Inayat Begum was incompetent 
and, therefore, nullity in law.” 
 
Reliance is placed on the case titled as Capt. Shahid 
Saleem Lone and others vs Ata-ur-Rahman and others 
(1985 CLC 2555). 
5. 
Moreover, the petitioners filed an application 
under Sections 14 & 17 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 

Civil Revision No.525/2013 
6 
 
 
against a dead person and on behalf of said dead person, 
his real brother while showing himself as his attorney 
made conceding statement, which shows collusivety of 
both the brothers who committed fraud in grabbing the 
suit land by preparing a fake arbitration agreement and 
obtaining award from the arbitrator which culminated 
into making of award as rule of the Court. As the very 
general power of attorney has been declared as defunct 
and abated, thus any superstructure built on the basis of 
the said instrument shall stand automatically dismantled. 
Moreover, after the acceptance of the application under 
Section 12(2) C.P.C, the revival of application under 
Sections 14 & 17 of the Arbitration Act ibid hold no legal 
worth and value therefore the same is liable to be buried 
at its inception to save the precious time of Courts and 
public. Reliance is place on cases titled as S.M.Shafi 
Ahmad Zaidi through Legal Heirs Vs. Malik Hassan Ali 
Khan (Moin) through Legal Heirs (2002 SCMR 338) & 
Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation 
Ltd. Vs Mian Abdul Latif & Others (PLD 2008 SC 371). 
6. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners stated that 
application under Section 12(2) CPC of respondents 
No.1 to 6 was hopelessly time barred, suffice it to say 
the respondents No.1 to 6 have mentioned in their 
application under Section 12(2) C.P.C. that they 

Civil Revision No.525/2013 
7 
 
 
instituted the application promptly after having 
knowledge of the same. The petitioners failed to bring 
on record any evidence to prove that the respondents 
knew the pendency of the application under Section 14 
& 17 of the Act ibid, passing of the Award as well as 
order dated 30.04.1989 for making Award as rule of the 
Court. As such the argument of learned counsel for the 
petitioners carries no weight and same is hereby 
repelled.  
7.  
Furthermore, that all the proceedings including 
the arbitration agreement and arbitration decision were 
initiated against dead person but also on the basis of 
defunct general power of attorney which are result of 
blatant misrepresentation and fraud, whereas fraud 
vitiates the most solemn proceedings and any edifice so 
raised on the basis of such fraudulent transaction, that 
stand automatically dismantled and any ill-gotten gain 
achieved by fraudster are not liable to be validated under 
any norms of laws. Reliance in this regard is placed on 
cases cited as Nawab Syed Raunaq Ali etc. Vs. Chief 
Settlement Commissioner & Others (PLD 1973 SC 236), 
Lahore Development Authority Vs. Firdous Steel Mills 
(Pvt.) Limited (2010 SCMR 1097), Sindh Irrigation and 
Drainage Authority Vs. Government of Sindh and others 
(2022 SCMR 595) & Mst. Nazeeran & Others Vs Ali 

Civil Revision No.525/2013 
8 
 
 
Bux & Others (2024 SCMR 1271). As the Arbitration 
agreement, passing of Award by the Arbitrator as well as 
order of the trial Court for making the said Award as rule 
of Court have been declared as result of fraud and illegal, 
thus revival of application under Sections 14 & 17 of the 
Arbitration Act, 1940 would be useless as such the said 
application also stands dismissed. Thus, the lower 
judicial fora after taking into consideration the 
respective pleadings, oral and documentary evidence of 
the parties have rightly passed the impugned judgments 
& decrees which do not suffers from any legal or 
factual infirmity. 
8. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners has neither 
pointed out any illegality or material irregularity, in the 
impugned judgments & decrees passed by the Courts 
below nor identified any jurisdictional defect. The 
concurrent findings of fact are against the petitioners 
which do not call for any interference by this Court in 
exercise of its revisional jurisdiction. Reliance is placed 
on the case titled as Mst. Zaitoon Begum Vs. Nazar 
Hussain & Another (2014 SCMR 1469).    
9. 
In view of above, this civil revision is dismissed 
being devoid of any merits with cost throughout. 
10.  
As the petitioners have filed frivolous litigation 
without any just reason and such practice shall be 

Civil Revision No.525/2013 
9 
 
 
discouraged and deprecated even by imposition of 
substantial cost upon the fraudulent litigants, as such 
while relying on recent pronouncements of the Hon'ble 
Supreme 
Court 
of 
Pakistan 
titled 
as 
Capital 
Development Authority, CDA through Chairman, CDA, 
Islamabad Vs. Ahmed Murtaza and another (2023 
SCMR 61), Province of Punjab through the Deputy 
Commissioner, Collector District Gujranwala and 
others Vs. Zulfiqar Ali and another (2024 SCMR 22) 
and Javed Hameed and others Vs. Aman Ullah and 
others (2024 SCMR 89) the petitioners are burdened 
with special cost of rupees Rs.10,00,000/- to be 
recovered as arrears of land revenue from the petitioners 
and deposited with Akhuwat Foundation and receipt 
thereof be placed on record. Let a copy of this judgment 
be sent to the Akhuwat Foundation for information.
