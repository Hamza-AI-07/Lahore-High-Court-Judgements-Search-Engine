Main Case 
4. 
Through this petition, petitioner has called in 
question order dated 14.03.2024 passed by 
Commissioner Wages Court, Multan constituted 
under Payment of Wages Act, 1936 (‘Act’) who 
has dismissed the application filed by the 
petitioner for rejection of claim of respondent No.2 
(Mushtaq Ahmad) filed under Section 15(3) of the 
Act by refusing to declare the same as barred by 
law. 
5. 
The claim of the petitioner is that Punjab 
College, Multan is a trans-provincial institution, 
therefore, 
only 
National 
Industrial Relation 
Commission (N.I.R.C.) has jurisdiction to entertain 
matters relating to the same and authorities 

W.P. No.15488 of 2024 
 
2 
 
constituted under laws of Punjab lack jurisdiction 
to proceed in claims against trans-provincial 
authorities. Seeks setting aside of the said order 
and rejection of claim of the respondent as barred 
by law on the ground that respondent No.1 lacks 
jurisdiction to entertain the same. 
6. 
Perusal of the record shows that on 
02.11.2019 respondent No.2 by claiming to be an 
employee of Punjab College, Multan filed claim 
for 
payment 
of 
his 
wages 
amounting to 
Rs.1,041,000/- along with ten times compensation 
for unlawfully deducting his wages which was 
controverted by the petitioner by filing reply on 
15.09.2020 based on various factual and legal 
grounds inter alia including the ground that 
respondent No.1 lacks jurisdiction to try the same 
as the petitioner being an educational institution 
does not fall within the ambit of labour laws but in 
the said reply petitioner had not claimed that it was 
a trans-provincial institution. Subsequently, on 
26.07.2023 petitioner filed an application for 
rejection of claim on the ground that petitioner is a 
trans-provincial institution and respondent No.2 
has no jurisdiction to entertain the same as 
proceedings could only be initiated before the 
N.I.R.C. under Section 35 of Industrial Relations 
Act, 2012. Respondent No.2 contested the said 
application by claiming that petitioner was 
precluded for raising the said objection as not only 
issues had been framed but evidence had already 
been recorded and matter had been listed for final 
hearing 
when 
said 
application 
was 
filed. 
Respondent No.1 after hearing the arguments of 
respondent No.2 on 14.03.2024 through the 
impugned order dismissed the application filed by 
the petitioner for rejection of claim by observing 

W.P. No.15488 of 2024

that the petitioner did not produce any document 
showing it to be a trans-provincial institution nor 
his counsel argued the matter despite various 
opportunities. The petitioner then challenged the 
said order through this constitutional petition and 
through order dated 18.11.2024 he was required by 
this Court to show documents as to how petitioner 
was a trans-provincial institution. Today through 
application additional documents have been filed 
which has been allowed. Through the said 
documents petitioner claims that Educational 
Excellence Limited is a registered company which 
owns and manages the petitioner-college and the 
said company is a trans-provincial corporation 
having various educational institutions in different 
provinces under its umbrella, hence, the status of 
Punjab College, Multan is also to be treated as 
trans-provincial institution. 
7. 
As regards the objection taken by the 
respondent No.2 in his reply to the application for 
rejection of claim filed before respondent No.1 that 
at the final stage of proceedings when the matter is 
fixed for final arguments, plea of jurisdiction 
cannot be raised for the first time, it is observed 
that the same was without any substance for the 
reason that it is an established principle of law that 
question as to whether the Court, Tribunal or 
Authority was not properly constituted, hence, 
proceedings must be held to be coram non judice 
is a question relating purely to jurisdiction of Court 
which could be raised and decided at any stage if 
the dictates of justice so require. Reliance is placed 
upon judgment reported as (1971 PLC 499) 
“Chittaranjan Cotton Mills Ltd. Vs. Staff Union” 
and (1998 SCMR 2029) “Syed Javaid Iqbal 
Bukhari 
Vs. 
Government 
of 
Pakistan 
and 

W.P. No.15488 of 2024 
 
4 
 
another.” However, this is also subject to the 
condition that question of law can be determined 
summarily if for the said determination facts are 
either not disputed or if disputed are such that 
without determination of factual controversy raised 
in the matter question of jurisdiction can be 
decided, however, where some disputed facts are 
required to be determined before question of 
jurisdiction can be addressed and without such 
determination jurisdiction could not be ascertained 
then the Court may decline to determine the same 
in a summary manner. 
8. 
There is also no cavil to the preposition that 
in terms of judgments reported as (2018 SCMR 
802) “Messrs Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd. and 
others Vs. Federation of Pakistan and others” and 
(2023 PLC 163) “President, The Bank of Punjab 
and 2 others Vs. Authority Under Payment of 
Wages Act, Vehari and another” only the N.I.R.C. 
has 
jurisdiction 
to 
entertain 
claims 
of 
employees/workers relating to trans-provincial 
organizations 
and 
provincial 
laws 
are 
not 
applicable but the same is subject to the condition 
that matter in issue relates to a trans-provincial 
organization and not otherwise. 
9. 
It is yet to be determined that whether and 
under what capacity the Educational Excellence 
Limited, Lahore holds the Punjab College, Multan 
under its umbrella for which neither ground was 
raised through original reply filed against the claim 
of respondent No.2 nor issues were got framed or 
evidence was led. Even otherwise, there is no 
document available on the record whereby the said 
question could be determined with certainty 
without requiring deeper appreciation into the 
internal affairs of the petitioner and Educational 

W.P. No.15488 of 2024 
 
5 
 
Excellence Limited, Lahore which cannot be done 
in constitutional jurisdiction of this Court. The 
appointment letter of respondent No.2 shows that 
his services as Security Guard had been engaged 
by Punjab College of Science, Multan and not by 
Educational Excellence Limited. Even the show-
cause notice was issued to the petitioner on 
28.06.2019 and disciplinary proceedings were 
conducted by Punjab College of Information 
Technology, 
Rasheedabad 
Chowk, 
Multan, 
therefore, it is yet to be established that the 
petitioner was an employee of Educational 
Excellence Limited, Lahore for treating him to be 
an employee of a trans-provincial organization 
which being a disputed fact cannot be summarily 
decided through constitutional jurisdiction of this 
Court. Consequently, presently there is no material 
substance available to hold the petitioner-
institution as a trans-provincial organization and 
declare that respondent No.1 was not vested with 
jurisdiction to entertain the claim filed by the 
respondent No.2, hence, the impugned order does 
not suffer from any jurisdictional defect of 
illegality for this Court to warrant interfere in the 
same which is upheld. However, the afore-referred 
observation is purely tentative in nature and would 
not be a hindrance in the way of any court of 
authority to pass appropriate orders in proceedings 
pending before it. This constitutional petition 
being devoid of merit stands dismissed.
