Mian Muhammad Tayyib Wattoo, Advocate for the appellant. 
Mr. Haroon Rasheed, Deputy Prosecutor General for the State 
(on Court’s call).  
  
Through instant criminal appeal, following prayer has been 
made:- 
 
“In the light of above submissions, it is respectfully 
prayed that this appeal may graciously be accepted and the 
impugned order dated 20.09.2024 passed by learned Additional 
Sessions Judge/Judge Special Court CNSA Sialkot be set aside 
and the learned trial court be directed to call the CDR from the 
concerned companies of the PW.4 for the sake of justice and fair 
play. 
 
It is further prayed that the proceedings of the learned 
trial court may kindly be suspended/stayed till the final disposal of 
the main criminal appeal to meet the ends of justice.  
 
Any other relief which this Hon’ble Court deems fit and 
proper may also be awarded to the appellant.”  
2. 
 
Brief however necessary facts for disposal of instant appeal are 
that Shabbir Hussain (appellant/accused in case arising out of F.I.R. 
No.775/2023 dated: 28.09.2023 registered under Section: 9 (1) 3(d), 9 (1) 5(d)  
of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 at Police Station: City Pasrur, 
District: Sialkot) has filed an application under Section: 540 Cr.P.C. for 
production of mobile data of complainant Ghazanfar Ali-ASI/PW-4 which has 
been dismissed vide order dated: 20.09.2024 passed by learned Additional 
Sessions Judge, Pasrur, District Sialkot; relevant portion of said order is 
reproduced:- 
 
“Learned counsel for the accused filed application u/s 540 
Cr.PC for production of Mobile Data of complainant Ghazanfar Ali 
ASI whose statement was recorded as PW-4. As per record the 
prosecution evidence was completed on 18.05.2024 and then the 
statement of accused was recorded on 29.06.2024 and then the case 
remained fixed for final arguments. Instead of advancing final 
arguments the instant application for production of Mobile Data of 
PW-4 has been filed. After closure of prosecution evidence and the 
statement of accused u/s 342 Cr.P.C, the accused could not be 
permitted to create new evidence through the court by filing the 
instant application. So the application having no force in the eye of 
law is hereby dismissed.” 
3.   
 
Learned counsel for the appellant submits that production of 
CDR of PW-4 is necessary; also adds that impugned order is against the law 
and facts of the case therefore same is liable to be set aside.

Learned Deputy Prosecutor General (on Court’s call) has 
supported the impugned order.  
5.   
 
Heard and record appended with the appeal perused.  
6. 
 
The Call Data Record = Call Detail Record herein after being 
referred as CDR is the record generated by telecommunication companies for 
every call made or received on its network, it includes phone numbers 
involved, date, time and duration of the call as well as detail of 
telecommunication/cellular tower in whose territorial range, SIM (Subscriber 
Identity Module) received or made the call, needless to add that range of 
cellular tower comprises of sizeable area. 
 
 
As far as production of CDR in the trial of criminal case for 
proving or disproving the presence of any witness at some place is concerned, 
it is relevant to mention here that if said witness is owner of the SIM i.e. same 
is registered in his name, it was operational/functional in his cell/mobile 
phone, he made or received phone call through said SIM and his forensically 
analysed voice record transcript/end to end audio or video recording is 
available, then availability of said SIM and its use at that particular time i.e. of 
making/receiving phone call in territorial range of cellular tower of said 
company can be assessed and ascertained, however, even then exact 
point/locale of availability of the SIM and person using the same in the 
territorial range of said cellular tower, which range usually comprises of 
considerable area, cannot be ascertained through CDR.  
 
 
So, in absence of forensically analysed voice record transcript/ 
end to end audio or video recording, mere production of CDR is of no 
avail/help to establish presence of any person even in territorial area/range of 
cellular tower; guidance in this regard has been sought from the case of 
“AZEEM KHAN and another  vs. MUJAHID KHAN and others” (2016 
SCMR 274), “The STATE through P.G. Sindh and others  vs. AHMED 
OMAR SHEIKH and others” (2021 SCMR 873) and “ISHTIAQ AHMED 
MIRZA and 2 others  vs. FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN and others” 
(PLD 2019 Supreme Court 675). 
 
 
It is not uncommon/unusual in our system that some time 
witness makes concessional statement against the record as well as case of 
prosecution for extending undue benefit to the accused; in this regard case of 
“MUHAMMAD SHARIF vs. MUHAMMAD JAVED alias JEDA TEDI 
AND 5 OTHERS” (PLD 1976 SC 452) can be safely referred; so, mere 
concessional statement of any witness that he was having mobile phone 

Crl. Appeal No. 68635/2024

number with him at relevant time without proof that SIM was registered in his 
name and without forensically analysed voice record transcript of call made or 
received by said witness, is of no avail and same cannot be made basis for 
summoning the CDR as it would be of no help for just decision of the case; in 
this regard, full Bench decision of this Court in the case of “Mst. SAIMA 
NOREEN  vs. The STATE and another” (PLD 2024 Lahore 522) can also 
be advantageously referred and relevant portions from the same are 
reproduced:- 
7. 
CDR is abbreviation of “Call Data Record” of SIM which is abbreviation 
of “Subscriber Identity Module”. As per “Report” submitted on behalf of Pakistan 
Telecommunication Authority, PTA was established under Section: 3 of Pakistan 
Telecommunication (Reorganization) Act, 1996 and is mandated to regulate the 
establishment, maintenance and operation of the telecommunication system and 
provision of telecommunication services in Pakistan.” 
 
“It is very much relevant to mention here that if question in a case is only 
regarding availability of any SIM in the territorial jurisdiction of any cellular tower 
at the time of receiving or making any particular phone call then perhaps CDR 
would provide some help but if the matter in issue is about presence of any human 
being either witness or accused on some particular place as a recipient or maker of 
the phone call as in this case is, then situation is quite different/otherwise.  
10. 
Although any accused or witness can claim or admit possession and use of 
any SIM “Subscriber Identity Module’ by him or anybody else at the time of 
occurrence or any other relevant time yet mere such claim or admission is not 
sufficient for relying on CDR “Call Data Record” of said SIM because CDR only 
shows use of SIM in territorial/geographical jurisdiction of “Cell Phone Tower” 
installed by telecom operator and does not disclose that who is actually/exactly 
carrying and using said SIM; however, “Voice Record Transcript” or “End to End 
Audio Recording” can reflect the detail/identification of the user. Therefore, without 
“Voice Recording Transcript”, mere  “Call Data Record” (CDR) alone of the SIM 
is inconclusive piece of evidence regarding identity of its user/carrier;  in this 
regard, guidance has been sought from the case of “AZEEM KHAN and another 
versus MUJAHID KHAN and others” (2016 SCMR 274); relevant portion from 
paragraph No.22 of said case law is hereby reproduced:-  
“22. 
The cell phone call data collected is of no help to the 
prosecution for the reasons that numerous calls have been made 
indicating continuous interaction between the two cell phones, 
contrary to the evidence given by Muhammad Wali (PW-3), who has 
stated at the trial that the unknown caller made calls on his cell 
phone four times. No competent witness was produced at the trial, 
who provided the call data, Ex.P-1 to Ex.P-5. No voice record 
transcript has been brought on record---.” 
 
 
 
 
 
           (emphasis added). 
 
Guidance on the subject has also been sought from the case of “Mian 
KHALID PERVIZ versus THE STATE through Special Prosecutor ANF 
and another” (2021 SCMR 522); relevant portion from paragraph No.7 of 
said case law reads as follows:- 
“--- Mere production of CDR DATA without transcripts of the 
calls or end to end audio recording cannot be considered/used as 
evidence worth reliance. Besides the call transcripts, it should 
also be established on the record that callers on both the ends 
were the same persons whose calls data is being used in 
evidence. While considering such type of evidence extra care is 
required to be taken by the Courts as advancement of science 
and technology, on the other hand, has also made it very 
convenient and easy to edit and make changes of one’s choice as 
highlighted and discussed in the case of Ishtiaq Ahmad Mirza 
supra. We also can lay hand on the case of Azeem Khan v. 
Mujahid Khan (2016 SCMR 274) in this regard. So, the CDR 

Crl. Appeal No. 68635/2024

DATA produced by the said witnesses is of no help to the 
Appellant and cannot be termed as evidence worth reliance to 
shatter the direct evidence adduced by the prosecution.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis added). 
 
Even “Voice Record Transcript” or “End to End Audio/Video 
Recording” of the call cannot be relied upon without forensic report 
about its genuineness; in this regard case of “The STATE through P.G. 
Sindh and others versus AHMED OMAR SHEIKH and others” (2021 
SCRM 873) can advantageously be referred; relevant portion from 
paragraph No.15 of said case law is hereby reproduced:-  
“---In absence of any forensic report about the 
genuineness or otherwise of the said video clip, no 
reliance can be placed on such piece of evidence as held 
in the case of Asfandyar and another  v. Kamran and 
another  (2016 SCMR 2084).” 
 
 
 
 
 
    (emphasis added) 
 
 
Requirements insisted upon by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan for 
proving audio tape or video before a court of law have been elaborated 
in paragraph-11 of the case of “ISHTIAQ AHMED MIRZA and 2 
others versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTN and others” (PLD 2019 
Supreme Court 675) and same are hereby reproduced:- 
* 
No audio tape or video can be relied upon by a court until the same 
is proved to be genuine and not tampered with or doctored.  
* 
A forensic report prepared by an analyst of the Punjab Forensic 
Science Agency in respect of an audio tape or video is per se 
admissible in evidence in view of the provisions of section 9(3) of 
the Punjab Forensic Science Agency Act, 2007. 
* 
Under Article 164 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 it lies in 
the discretion of a court to allow any evidence becoming available 
through an audio tape or video to be produced.  
* 
Even where a court allows an audio tape or video to be produced in 
evidence such audio tape or video has to be proved in accordance 
with the law of evidence.  
* 
Accuracy of the recording must be proved and satisfactory 
evidence, direct or circumstantial, has to be produced so as to rule 
out any possibility of tampering with the record.  
* 
An audio tape or video sought to be produced in evidence must be 
the actual record of the conversation as and when it was made or of 
the event as and when it took place.  
* 
The person recording the conversation or event has to be produced.  
* 
The person recording the conversation or event must produce the 
audio tape or video himself.  
* 
The audio tape or video must be played in the court.  
* 
An audio tape or video produced before a court as evidence ought 
to be clearly audible or viewable.  
* 
The person recording the conversation or event must identify the 
voice of the person speaking or the person seen or the voice or 
person seen may be identified by any other person who recognizes 
such voice or person.  
* 
Any other person present at the time of making of the conversation 
or taking place of the event may also testify in support of the 

Crl. Appeal No. 68635/2024 
 
5
conversation heard in the audio tape or the event shown in the 
video.  
* 
The voices recorded or the persons shown must be properly 
identified.  
* 
The evidence sought to be produced through an audio tape or video 
has to be relevant to the controversy and otherwise admissible.  
* 
Safe custody of the audio tape or video after its preparation till 
production before the court must be proved.  
* 
The transcript of the audio tape or video must have been prepared 
under independent supervision and control.  
* 
The person recording an audio tape or video may be a person 
whose part of routine duties is recording of an audio tape or video 
and he should not be a person who has recorded the audio tape or 
video for the purpose of laying a trap to procure evidence. 
* 
The source of an audio tape or video becoming available has to be 
disclosed. 
* 
The date of acquiring the audio tape or video by the person 
producing it before the court ought to be disclosed by such person.  
* 
An audio tape or video produced at a late stage of a judicial 
proceeding may be looked at with suspicion.  
* 
A formal application has to be filed before the court by the person 
desiring an audio tape or video to be brought on the record of the 
case as evidence. ” 
 
Of course, accused can take any plea and he has to simply show 
possibility of its correctness but such possibility must be based on 
conclusive and reliable piece of evidence.  
 
We are also conscious of the fact that extending of undue and 
gratuitous/obliging concessions by witnesses during recording of their 
statements is not uncommon in our system and in this regard, case of 
“Muhammad Sharif versus Muhammad Javed alias Jeda Tedi and five 
others” (PLD 1976 SC 452) can be advantageously referred, hence mere 
admission of the witness regarding use of any SIM must be corroborated 
not only by its CDR but also by “end to end” audio recording of “voice 
call” confirmed by due forensic analysis. Furthermore, CDR and voice 
record transcript as well as its forensic analysis report must be proved in 
accordance with law for reliance.  
 
So far as case of “Muhammad Asif Ali Usama versus The State 
and two others” (2022 PCr.LJ 59) is concerned, it has been observed by 
us that aforementioned case-laws i.e. (AZEEM KHAN and another 
versus MUJAHID KHAN and others) 2016 SCMR 274, (Mian KHALID 
PERVIZ versus THE STATE through Special Prosecutor ANF and another) 
2021 SCMR 522 and (The STATE through P.G. Sindh and others versus 
AHMED OMAR SHEIKH and others) 2021 SCRM 873 have not been 
discussed in it and we respectfully did not agree with ratio of the same.  
11. 
In peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, at this appellate 
stage, “Call Data Record” (CDR) is not conclusive piece of evidence for 
the purpose of determining and establishing the identity and presence of 
any witness or person at some exact locale/position/place. Application 
filed by applicant for summoning  representative of a telecom company 
(JAZZ) for verification of photocopy of CDRs was dismissed by the 
learned trial court and said order was not challenged and same attained 
finality.  It is important to mention here that only said piece of evidence 
can be brought on record through additional evidence at appellate stage 

Crl. Appeal No. 68635/2024

which has been considered as necessary for decision of the case and is 
having concrete evidentiary worth beyond shadow of doubt, however, in 
the instant appeal, aforementioned Call Data Record (CDR) does not 
fulfill said condition/criteria. In Ishtiaq Ahmed Mirza’s case (mentioned 
supra), the august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held that necessity of 
taking additional evidence at the appellate stage must be felt by the 
appellate court itself and it does not depend upon what a party to the 
appeal thinks of such necessity; relevant portion from paragraph No.12 
of said case law reads as follows:- 
“---The necessity of taking additional evidence at the 
appellate stage must be felt by the appellate court itself 
and the same is not to depend upon what a party to the 
appeal thinks of such necessity---.” 
 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis added).” 
“12. 
For what has been discussed above, we are of the considered 
view that at this appellate stage, bringing of “Call Data Record” 
(CDR) through additional evidence on record of instant appeal is 
neither necessary for just decision of the case nor the same would 
serve any useful purpose for the applicant/appellant in any manner 
whatsoever. In such perspective, instant miscellaneous application is 
without merits and same is hereby dismissed.” 
7. 
 
Since in this case forensically analysed voice record 
transcript/end to end audio or video recording of the call made or received 
by the witness is not available therefore CDR is not the conclusive piece of 
evidence hence cannot be considered as necessary for just decision of the 
case thus this appeal is without merits and is hereby dismissed in limine.
