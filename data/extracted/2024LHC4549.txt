Mr. Nauman Khalid, Assistant Attorney General for Pakistan, 
with William John/SI, FIA. 
 
 
 
 
Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – The Petitioner, Rukhsar Ahmad, is 
under arrest in connection with FIR No. 79/2024, dated 18.04.2024, 
registered at Police Station FIA, District Gujrat, for offences under 
Sections 23, 27(1), and 27(4) of the Drugs Act, 1976 (the “Drugs Act”), 
read with section 27 of the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan Act, 
2012 (the “DRAP Act”). The prosecution‟s case is that the Petitioner and 
his co-accused have established Prime Pharmacy on Sohawa Road, Mandi 
Bahauddin. The competent authority received source information that they 
were involved in the illegal trade of unregistered, unwarranted, and 
spurious drugs. Consequently, on 17.04.2024, it formed a special team led 
by the Complainant, District Drug Controller, which, in coordination with 
the FIA, conducted an inspection of Prime Pharmacy and its adjacent 
storage facility, both of which were under the control of the Petitioner and 
his co-accused. 
2. 
 
During the inspection, the Complainant identified ten varieties 
of therapeutic goods at Prime Pharmacy, including allopathic drugs and 
alternative medicines that were either unregistered, suspected to be 
spurious, lacked essential manufacturing and enlistment details, or were 
without warranty. He seized these items, collected samples for testing and 
analysis, and duly prepared Form-4 and Form-5, securing the Petitioner‟s 
signature and thumb impressions of the Petitioner, who was present on the 
spot. Following the inspection, both the pharmacy and the adjoining 
godown were sealed for violations of the Drugs Act and the DRAP Act. 
 
3. 
 
On the same day, 17.04.2024, the Complainant submitted a 
preliminary report to the Secretary, District Quality Control Board, Mandi 
Bahauddin. The Board convened a meeting, reviewed the evidence, and 

Crl.Misc.No.45595-B/2024 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 
unanimously approved the registration of the FIR against the Petitioner and 
his co-accused. Consequently, FIR No. 79/2024 was lodged on 18.04.2024.  
4. 
 
The Petitioner seeks post-arrest bail through this application 
under Section 497 Cr.P.C. He denies the allegation that the seized drugs 
were unregistered, spurious, or without warranty and contends that the 
Complainant lodged FIR No. 79/2024 without following the prescribed 
procedure. He maintains that the entire proceedings are without jurisdiction 
and lawful authority.  
5. 
 
The Assistant Attorney General has vehemently opposed this 
application. He contends that the PWs, who have recorded their statements 
under Section 161 Cr.P.C., support the prosecution‟s case. He argues that 
the Petitioner is involved in the illicit sale of therapeutic goods, including 
both allopathic drugs and alternative medicines. The Law Officer further 
states that the Complainant had no reason to falsely implicate the Petitioner 
in this case and that FIR No. 79/2024 was registered in accordance with the 
law.  
6. 
 
We first address the issue of whether the prosecution has been 
lawfully initiated against the Petitioner. For this, we need to examine the 
legal framework in detail. 
7. 
 
The Drugs Act regulates the import, export, manufacture, 
storage, distribution and sale of drugs.1  Section 11(1) of the Act mandates 
that each Provincial Government establish a Provincial Quality Control 
Board (PQCB) consisting of such members, including a Chairman, as that 
Government may appoint from time to time. Section 11(5) outlines the 
PQCB‟s powers and functions, which include inspecting drug 
manufacturing or sale premises, recommending licence suspensions or 
cancellations for violations, reviewing reports of the Provincial Inspectors 
regarding contraventions of the Act and analyzing reports of the 
Government Analysts on drugs submitted for testing, and subsequently 
issuing instructions to the Inspectors as to the action to be taken on such 
reports. Section 11(6) allows the PQCB to delegate its powers and 
functions to one or more of its members. 
8. 
 
Section 17 empowers the Federal or Provincial Government to 
appoint Inspectors, while Section 18 defines their powers. Section 19

details the procedures they must follow when seizing any drug or article 
under Section 18. Notably, Section 19(6) requires that, upon identifying 
any contravention of the Act, the Provincial Inspector must always refer the 
case to the PQCB, unless directed otherwise, and seek instructions 
regarding the action to be taken for such violations. 
9. 
 
Section 22(1) of the Drugs Act stipulates that when an 
Inspector submits a drug sample for testing and analysis to the Government 
Analyst, the Analyst shall deliver him a signed report in quadruplicate in 
the prescribed form and forward one copy to the designated authority. 
Section 22(3) requires that, upon receiving the report, the Inspector send a 
copy to the relevant board (Central Licensing, Registration, or PQCB) to 
seek their directions regarding the action to be taken on its basis.  
10. 
 
Chapter III (Sections 23 to 26) of the Drugs Act lists the 
prohibitions, while Chapter IV (Sections 27 to 42) details the offences, 
penalties, and procedures. For our present purpose, Section 30(1) of the Act 
is relevant, which provides that, subject to Section 19, no prosecution under 
this Chapter shall be initiated except by a Federal or Provincial Inspector.2 
11. 
 
The Punjab Government has framed the Punjab Drugs Rules 
2007 (the “Drugs Rules”) while exercising powers under Section 44 of the 
Drugs Act. Rule 3 describes the constitution of the PQCB. Rule 4(1) 
authorizes the PQCB to constitute a committee in a district to be known as 
the District Quality Control Board (“DQCB”). Rule 4(4) states that the 
DQCB shall perform its functions under general supervision and subject to 
the control of the PQCB. Rule 5(3) stipulates: 
(3)  
The Provincial or the District Board shall examine a case referred 
to it by an Inspector and shall, if an action is proposed to be taken 
against a person under the Act or the rules, issue a show cause 
notice to the person and provide him an opportunity for hearing 
before taking the action about the prosecution of the person or 
recommending suspension or cancellation of his licence to the 
licensing authority. 
                                                 
2 For ease of reference, Section 30(1) of the Drugs Act is reproduced below: 
30. Cognizance of offences.- (1) Subject to the provisions of section 19, no prosecution shall be instituted under 
this Chapter except –  
(a) 
by a Federal Inspector, where the prosecution is in respect of a contravention of clause (h) of sub-section 
(1) of section 23 or section 24 or any of the provisions of this Act or the rules relating to the import or export of 
drugs or the manufacture for sale, or sale, of a drug which is not for the time being registered or for the 
manufacture for sale of which a licence is not for the time being in force; or 
(b) 
by a Provincial Inspector:  
 
 
Provided that, where the public interest so requires, the Federal Inspector may, with the prior permission 
of the Federal Government, institute a prosecution for a contravention of any other provision of this Act.

In 2012, Parliament enacted the DRAP Act (XXI of 2012) to 
establish the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP)3 “to provide 
for effective coordination and enforcement of the Drugs Act and to bring 
harmony in inter-provincial trade and commerce of therapeutic goods, and 
to regulate, manufacture, import, export, storage, distribution, and sale of 
therapeutic goods.” Section 7 of the Act describes the DRAP‟s powers and 
functions. Section 27(1) states that the offences shall be such as specified 
in Schedule-III, and Section 27(2) provides that the prohibitions specified 
in Schedule-II shall be punishable in accordance with Schedule-III. 
13. 
 
Schedule-V of the DRAP Act outlines the powers of 
Inspectors. Clause (6) thereof stipulates that, unless otherwise directed, the 
Provincial Inspector must always refer any contraventions of the DRAP 
Act or the Drugs Act to the PQCB and seek instructions regarding the 
appropriate action to be taken. Section 29 stipulates that the Inspector shall 
take cognizance of the offences in the manner specified in Schedule-IV.4 
14. 
 
It is essential to point out that Section 30 of the Drugs Act, 
Section 29 of the DRAP Act, and Schedule-IV of the DRAP Act bear the 
heading “Cognizance of offences”. The term “cognizance” has not been 
defined in any of these statutes – or even the Code of Criminal Procedure 
1898. In Wazir v. The State [PLD 1962 (W.P.) Lahore 405], after an 
extensive deliberation, a Full Bench of this Court opined: 
“ … the police report by itself, when received by the Magistrate, does 
not constitute the taking of cognizance, and it is reasonable to expect that 
something more will be done to show that the Magistrate intends to start 
the proceeding … He may keep the case waiting until the sanction 
arrives and then pass some order to show that he intends to hold a trial.” 
                                                 
3 Parliament enacted this Act pursuant to the resolutions under Article 144 of the Constitution passed by the Provincial 
Assesmblies of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and Sindh.  
4 Section 29 of the DRAP Act reads as follows: 
29.   Cognizance of offences.- Cognizance of offences shall be taken by the Inspector in the manner specified in 
Schedule-IV.  
  Clause (1) of Schedule-IV to the DRAP Act provides: 
(1) 
Subject to the provisions of Schedule-V, no prosecution shall be instituted under this Act  
except,––  
(a)  
by a Federal Inspector, where the prosecution is in respect of a contravention of Clause (h) of 
Paragraph (1) of heading A of Schedule-II or any of the provisions of this Act or the rules relating to the 
import or export of therapeutic goods or the manufacture for sale, or sale, of a therapeutic good which is 
not for the time being registered or for the manufacture for sale of which a licnece is not for the time 
being in force; or  
(b)  
by a Provincial Inspector: 
 
 
Provided that, where the public interest so requires, the Federal Inspector may, with the prior permission 
of the Registration Board or Licensing Board as the case may be, institute a prosecution for a contravention of any 
other provision of this Act and the Drugs Act, 1976 (XXXI of 1976).

The ratio of the Wazir case has been consistently followed.5 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan also endorsed it in Ali Gohar and others v. 
Pervaiz Ahmed and others (PLD 2020 SC 427). 
16. 
 
In Haq Nawaz and others v. The State and others  
(2000 SCMR 785), the Supreme Court discussed the term “cognizance of a 
case” and clarified that it is distinguishable from the “commencement of a 
trial.” The Court held that taking cognizance of a case by a court is the first 
step in the criminal process, but it is not equivalent to the beginning of the 
trial. Cognizance is an early procedural step that may or may not lead to a 
trial. The trial begins when copies of the documents are supplied to the 
accused under Section 265-C Cr.P.C., and the charge is framed. In  
Ali Gohar, supra, the Supreme Court ruled that the Anti-Terrorism Court 
would be said to take “cognizance of the case” when, on the receipt of the 
challan along with the material placed therewith by the prosecution, it takes 
judicial notice thereon by the conscious application of mind and takes 
positive steps to indicate that the trial of the case is to follow. These steps 
need not necessarily be recorded as judicial orders. What is essential is that 
the orders so passed or steps taken reflect that ATC is to proceed with the 
trial. 
17. 
 
However, the substantive provisions of Section 30 of the 
Drugs Act, Section 29 of the DRAP Act, and Schedule IV of the DRAP 
Act mandate that “no prosecution shall be instituted” unless certain 
conditions are complied with. In State (CBI) v. Sashi Balasubramanian 
and another [2006 (13) SCC 252], the Supreme Court of India (SCI) ruled 
that the terms “prosecution” and “cognizance” carry different meanings 
and are not interchangeable.  
18. 
 
The word “prosecute”, which is derived from a Latin word 
prosecutus, past participle of prosequi, signifies not only “to follow”, but 
“to follow intensively” without intermission, thus, to follow or pursue with 
a view to reach, execute or accomplish. According to the Black’s Law 
Dictionary, “prosecution” means (i) the commencement and carrying out of 
any action or scheme; (ii) a criminal proceeding in which an accused 
person is tried. Wharton’s Law Lexicon states that “prosecution” means  
“a proceeding either by way of indictment or information in the criminal

courts, in order to put an offender upon his trial. In all criminal 
prosecutions, the King is nominally the prosecutor.” In Maqbool Hussain 
v. The State of Bombay (AIR 1953 SC 325), the SCI defined the aforesaid 
term to mean “an initiation or starting of proceedings of a criminal nature 
before a court of law or a judicial tribunal in accordance with the procedure 
prescribed in the statute which creates the offence and regulates the 
procedure.”  
19. 
 
In Syed Alamdar Hussain Shah v. Abdul Baseer Qureshi and 
others (PLD 1978 SC 121), the Supreme Court of Pakistan observed: 
“According to Corpus Juris Secundum, the term „prosecution‟ has 
different meanings when used in different relations, and it is regarded as 
a word of limited or extended signification according to the intention of 
the lawmaker or the person using it. In its broadest sense, the term would 
embrace all proceedings in the course of justice or even elsewhere for the 
protection or enforcement of a right or the punishment of a wrong, 
whether of a public or private character. In a more limited sense, the 
term includes the act of conducting or waging a proceeding in court; the 
following up or carrying on of an action or suit already commenced until 
the remedy be attained; the institution and carrying on of a suit in a court 
of law or equity to obtain some right or to redress and punish some 
wrong. It includes commencing, conducting, and carrying a suit to a 
conclusion in a court of justice.” 
20. 
 
The headings of Section 30 of the Drugs Act, Section 29 of the 
DRAP Act, and Schedule IV of the DRAP Act appear inconsistent with the 
substantive provisions of these sections and the schedule. According to 
Bennion, the court must prioritize the legislative intent in such a situation; 
it should not allow the heading to control the substantive provisions and 
override their plain meaning. He explains:6 
“A heading within an Act, whether contained in the body of the Act or a 
Schedule, is part of the Act. It may be considered in construing any 
provision of the Act, provided due account is taken of the fact that its 
function is merely to serve as a brief, and therefore necessarily 
inaccurate guide to the material to which it is attached.7 … Headings are 
unamendable descriptive components. Like anything else in what 
Parliament puts out as its Act, a heading is part of the Act, despite dicta 
to the contrary. Harman J said „ . . . the construction of an Act cannot be 
controlled by cross-headings.‟8 However, it can often be assisted by 
them, and it is the court‟s duty to take advantage of this aid when 
arriving at the legal meaning of an enactment.9 Nevertheless, a heading 
is of very limited use in interpretation because of its necessarily brief and

inaccurate nature.10 Any heading can only be an approximation and may 
not cover all the detailed matters falling within the provision to which it 
is attached.11 Furthermore, it may fail to get altered when some 
amendment made in Parliament to those provisions would justify this … 
Where a heading differs from the material it describes, this puts the court 
on inquiry. However, it is most unlikely to be right to allow the plain 
literal meaning of the words to be overridden purely by reason of a 
heading.”12  
21. 
 
Applying the above principle, the substantive provisions of the 
Drugs Act and DRAP Act should guide our interpretation, regardless of 
their inconsistency with the headings. Sections 19(6), 22(1), and 30(1) of 
the Drugs Act, along with Rule 5(3) of the Drugs Rules, establish a 
procedural framework that requires an Inspector to refer a case to the 
Provincial or District Board when a potential violation of the Act is 
identified. The Board must review the case and, if it finds that action is 
necessary, issue a show cause notice, giving the alleged offender an 
opportunity to explain his position before any formal measures, such as 
prosecution or suspension of licence, are taken. Similarly, the implication 
of Section 29 of the DRAP Act, read with Schedules IV and V, is that 
prosecution can only be initiated by a Federal or Provincial Inspector, who 
must refer the matter to the PQCB and seek directions on the appropriate 
course of action. However, since this procedural framework represents a 
significant departure from the standard criminal process, where an FIR may 
be registered directly when a cognizable offence is committed, the crucial 
question is whether the requirement of a show cause notice and the 
opportunity for a hearing under Rule 5(3) of the Drug Rules is mandatory. 
22. 
 
A mandatory provision demands strict adherence, and failure 
to comply renders any subsequent action invalid or unlawful. In contrast, a 
directory provision is more flexible, and non-compliance does not 
necessarily invalidate the action, provided the essential purpose of the 
requirement is fulfilled. A general rule suggests that if a statutory provision 
is expressed in negative terms, indicating that an action must be performed 
in a specific way and no other, it is typically considered mandatory, and 
non-compliance will invalidate the process. Conversely, provisions 
expressed in affirmative terms are often seen as directory. However,

exceptions exist where even provisions framed in negative language have 
been interpreted as directory.13 In the Province of Punjab and others v. 
Javed Iqbal (2021 SCMR 328), the Supreme Court of Pakistan emphasized 
that the ultimate test for determining whether a provision is directory or 
mandatory lies in uncovering the legislative intent rather than merely 
focusing on the language used in the statute. The purpose and objective 
behind enacting the provision are strong indicators for understanding this 
intent. It is essential to interpret the provision not just based on its wording 
but also by considering its nature, the objectives it seeks to achieve, and the 
consequences that would follow from interpreting it in different ways. This 
requires a careful examination of the overall framework of the statute to 
discover its true purpose.  
23. 
 
Courts generally interpret provisions that significantly affect 
individual rights or procedural safeguards as mandatory to ensure justice 
and fairness. In Atta Muhammad Qureshi v. The Settlement 
Commissioner, Lahore Division, and others (PLD 1971 SC 61), the 
Supreme Court held that, as a general rule, statutes that enable individuals 
to initiate legal proceedings under specified circumstances require strict 
compliance with those circumstances, even if the provisions are expressed 
in merely affirmative language. Based on this principle, the Court 
determined that sub-clause (5) of section 20 of the Displaced Persons 
(Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act, 1958 is mandatory, imposing a 
limitation on the revising authority by prohibiting it from making any 
adverse order against an individual without first giving him the opportunity 
to present his case. If an order is made without fulfilling this pre-condition, 
it would lack jurisdiction. In Javed Iqbal, supra, the Supreme Court further 
explained that, as a general principle, statutes regulating the manner in 
which public officials exercise their vested powers are typically construed 
as directory rather than mandatory, especially when no private or public 
rights are infringed. However, if the public interest or private rights require 
the exercise of such powers, the provision should be treated as mandatory 
despite the permissive and directory form of the language. Where non-
compliance with a provision causes inconvenience or injustice, it must be 
considered obligatory.

24. 
 
In Rule 5(3) of the Drugs Rules, the use of the word “shall” in 
phrases like “shall examine” and “shall issue a show cause notice” clearly 
suggests that the provision is mandatory, requiring strict adherence. 
Although the Rule does not explicitly outline penalties for non-compliance, 
its primary purpose is to protect individual rights by ensuring procedural 
fairness through the issuance of a show cause notice and the opportunity to 
be heard. As such, it must be treated as mandatory, and failure to comply 
with this Rule could render any actions taken invalid. 
 
25. 
 
In C.P. 1861-L/2020 (titled: “Province of Punjab v. M/s Flow 
Pharmaceuticals (Pvt) Ltd.”) decided on 28.01.2021,14 it was argued that 
since a cognizable offence had been committed, the Board could proceed 
with registering the case without issuing a show cause notice to the 
concerned individual. However, the Supreme Court nixed the contention, 
holding that Rule 5(3) was mandatory. It held: 
“The language of the above provision is unambiguous and requires that 
before prosecuting the person, the Board shall give a show cause notice 
to the concerned person and after granting a hearing to the said person, if 
required, the proposed action of prosecution will be adopted. The 
requirement of issuing a show cause notice is, therefore, mandatory 
under the said Rule. The above Rule meets the requirements of due 
process and fair trial under Articles 4 and 10A of the Constitution.” 
 
26. 
 
In the present case, the Government Analyst issued reports 
regarding the seized therapeutic goods on various dates after the 
registration of the FIR, i.e., on 04.06.2024, 15.06.2024, and 25.06.2024. 
The DQCB proceeded without waiting for these reports, although they 
were necessary to determine what action should be taken against the 
Petitioner. Furthermore, it failed to issue a show cause notice to the 
Petitioner or provide him with an opportunity to present his defence. In 
view of the law and judicial precedents discussed above, we uphold the 
Petitioner‟s contention that the Complainant lodged FIR No.79/2024 
without following the prescribed procedure. As a result, the entire 
proceedings are coram non judice and without lawful authority.  
 
27. 
 
In Muhammad Anwar and others v. Mst. Ilyas Begum and 
others (PLD 2013 SC 255), the Supreme Court of Pakistan held that 
Article 4 of the Constitution of Pakistan (1973) mandates that it is the 
inalienable right of every citizen to enjoy the protection of the law and to 
be treated in accordance with the law. Therefore, if any forum or court,

including a revisional court, passes an order that is patently illegal or 
violates the express provisions and spirit of the law, allowing such an order 
to remain intact would result in a serious breach of the litigants‟ legal rights 
and cause prejudice to them. In such cases, the High Court, while 
exercising its constitutional jurisdiction, has the authority to rectify the 
illegality, correct the violation of law, and undo the harm caused by the 
order of the revisional court. In Syed Raza Hussain Bukhari v. The State 
and others (PLD 2022 SC 743), the Supreme Court held that even when 
hearing a bail petition under Sections 497/498 Cr.P.C., the High Court 
retains both its inherent jurisdiction under Section 561-A Cr.P.C. and its 
constitutional jurisdiction as a guardian of the accused‟s fundamental 
rights. No sub-constitutional legislation can circumscribe this protective 
constitutional jurisdiction of the High Courts. In FIA through Director 
General, FIA, and others v. Syed Hamid Ali Shah and others  
(PLD 2023 SC 265), the Supreme Court held that Article 199(1)(a)(ii) of 
the Constitution empowers the High Courts to judicially review the actions 
and proceedings of persons performing functions related to the affairs of 
the Federation, a Province, or a local authority. If such actions or 
proceedings are found to have been taken without lawful authority, the 
High Courts can declare them invalid and without legal effect. This 
includes the registration of an FIR and the conduct of investigations, which 
are actions carried out by officers of the police department – a provincial 
law enforcement agency – and thus fall under the High Courts‟ jurisdiction 
as per Article 199(1)(a)(ii) of the Constitution. The High Courts can 
declare such acts of the police officers to have been made without lawful 
authority and of no legal effect if found so, and can also issue any 
appropriate incidental or consequential orders to effectuate their decision, 
such as quashing the FIR and investigation proceedings. 
 
28. 
 
Since FIR No. 79/2024 dated 18.04.2024 has been registered 
without following the prescribed procedure, we are inclined to quash it 
while exercising our constitutional jurisdiction. 
 
29. 
 
The object of an order in the nature of a writ of certiorari and
