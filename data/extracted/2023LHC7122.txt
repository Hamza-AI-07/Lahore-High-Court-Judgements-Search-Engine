On 03.04.2019, the prosecution evidence was closed after tendering the 
reports of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh. P.V and Exh.P.W.).  
 
8. 
After the closure of prosecution evidence, the learned trial court examined 
the appellants namely Ghulam Shabbir son of Karim Bakhsh and Begum Bibi 
daughter of Muhammad Ilyas under section 342 Cr.P.C. and in answer to the 
question why this case against you and why the P.W.s have deposed against you, 
they replied that they were innocent and had been falsely involved in the case. 
Ghulam Shabbir son of Karim Bakhsh and Begum Bibi daughter of Muhammad 
Ilyas further stated that they had not committed any offence and had been made a 
scapegoat in the case in order to show efficiency by the police. The appellants 
namely Ghulam Shabbir son of Karim Bakhsh and Begum Bibi daughter of 
Muhammad Ilyas opted not to get themselves examined under section 340(2) 
Cr.P.C did not adduce any evidence in their defence.  
 
9. 
On the conclusion of the trial, the learned Additional Sessions Judge (Model 
Criminal Trial Court), Lodhran, convicted and sentenced the appellant as referred 
to above.  
 
10. 
The contention of the learned counsel for the appellants precisely is that the 
whole case is fabricated and false. The learned counsel for the appellants submitted 
that the prosecution remained unable to prove the facts in issue and did not 
produce any unimpeachable, admissible and relevant evidence. The learned 
counsel for the appellants further contended that the statements of prosecution 
witnesses were not worthy of any reliance. The learned counsel for the appellants

also argued that the recoveries were full of procedural defects, of no legal worth 
and value and result of fake proceedings. The learned counsel for the appellants 
finally submitted that the prosecution had totally failed to prove the case against 
the appellants namely Ghulam Shabbir and Begum Bibi beyond the shadow of 
doubt.   
11. 
  On the other hand, the learned Additional Prosecutor General along with 
the learned counsel for the complainant, contended that the prosecution had proved 
its case beyond shadow of doubt by producing independent witnesses. The learned 
Additional Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the complainant further 
argued that the deceased was murdered by the appellants. The learned Additional 
Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the complainant further argued that 
the recoveries from the appellants also corroborated the statements of the other 
witnesses. The learned Additional Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for 
the complainant contended that there was no occasion for the prosecution 
witnesses, who were related to the deceased, to substitute the real offenders with 
the innocent in this case. The learned Additional Prosecutor General and the 
learned counsel for the complainant prayed for the rejection of the appeals as 
lodged by Ghulam Shabbir and Begum Bibi. The learned counsel for the 
complainant also argued that the Criminal Appeal No.385 of 2021, assailing the 
acquittal of Muhammad Bilal and Muhammad Mukhtar alias Kudan by the learned 
trial court from the charges also merited acceptance. 
12. 
We have heard the learned counsel for the appellants, the learned counsel for 
the complainant, the learned Additional Prosecutor General and with their 
assistance carefully perused the record and evidence recorded during the trial.

After consideration of the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the 
appellants namely Ghulam Shabbir and Begum Bibi, the learned Additional 
Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the complainant and scanning the 
evidence, it is pertinent to mention here that in the instant matter, ocular evidence 
is not available. There can be no dispute regarding the fact that the case is built on 
circumstantial evidence. In dealing with circumstantial evidence, the rules 
especially applicable to such evidence must be borne in mind. In such cases, there 
is always the danger that conjecture or suspicion may take the place of legal proof 
and therefore, it is right to recall the warning addressed by Baron Alderson to the 
jury in Reg. V. Hodge, (1938) 2 Lewin 227) where he said:  
"The mind was apt to take a pleasure in adapting circumstances to 
one another, and even in straining them a little, if need be, to force 
them to form parts of one connected whole; and the more ingenious 
the mind of the individual, the more likely was it, considering such 
matters, to overreach and mislead itself, to supply some little link 
that is wanting, to take for granted some fact consistent with its 
previous theories and necessary to render them complete." 
 Sir Alfred Wills, in his book "An Essay on the Principles of Circumstantial 
Evidence" (pages 173 to 190 of the Fifth American, from the Fourth London 
Edition published in 1872), lays down the following rules specially to be observed 
in the case of circumstantial evidence:  
"RULE 1.   The facts  alleged as the basis of any legal inference must be 
clearly proved, and indubitably connected with the factum probandum. 
RULE   2. The burden of proof is always on the party who asserts the 
existence of any fact which infers legal accountability

15 
 
RULE 3.    In  all cases, whether of  direct or  circumstantial evidence, the 
best evidence must be  adduced which the nature of  the case admits  
RULE 4.-  In order to justify the inference of guilt the inculpatory facts 
must be   incompatible with the innocence of   the accused, and incapable 
of explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt. 
RULE 5.    If   there be any reasonable doubt of   the guilt of   the accused, 
he  is  entitled, as  of right, to  be   acquitted." 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in its binding judgment titled "Naveed 
Asghar and two others Vs. The State" (P L D 2021 Supreme Court 600) has 
enunciated the following principle of law for the appreciation of circumstantial 
evidence:  
          "Approach to determine sufficiency of circumstantial evidence 
14. The settled approach to deal with the question as to sufficiency of 
circumstantial evidence for conviction of the accused person is this: If, on 
the facts and circumstances proved, no hypothesis consistent with the 
innocence of the accused person can be suggested, the case is fit for 
conviction of the accused person on such conclusion; however, if such 
facts and circumstances can be reconciled with any reasonable hypothesis 
compatible with the innocence of the appellant, the case is to be treated 
one of insufficient evidence, resulting in acquittal of the accused person. 
Circumstantial evidence, in a murder case, should be like a well-knit 
chain, one end of which touches the dead body of the deceased and the 
other the neck of the accused. No link in chain of the circumstances should 
be broken and the circumstances should be such as cannot be explained 
away on any reasonable hypothesis other than guilt of accused person. 
Chain of such facts and circumstances has to be completed to establish 
guilt of the accused person beyond reasonable doubt and to make the plea 
of his being innocent incompatible with the weight of evidence against 
him. Any link missing from the chain breaks the whole chain and renders 
the same unreliable; in that event, conviction cannot be safely recorded, 
especially on a capital charge. Therefore, if the circumstantial evidence is 
found not of the said standard and quality, it will be highly unsafe to rely 
upon the same for conviction; rather, not to rely upon such evidence will a 
better and a safer course." 
 
Thus, in a case of circumstantial evidence, the prosecution must establish each 
instance of incriminating circumstance by way of reliable and clinching evidence, 
and the circumstances so proved must form a complete chain of events, on the 

Murder Reference No.51 of 2019

16 
 
basis of which no conclusion other than one of guilt of the accused can be reached. 
Undoubtedly, suspicion, however grave it may be, can never be treated as a 
substitute for proof. From the evidence of the prosecution available on record, it is 
clear that the case of the prosecution hinges upon the evidence of the confession of 
the appellant namely Ghulam Shabbir while in police custody leading to the 
recovery of the dead body of the deceased on the pointing of the appellant namely 
Ghulam Shabbir, the seeing of the appellant namely Ghulam Shabbir by the 
witnesses namely Muhammad Ismail (PW-3) and Muhammad Rashid (PW-4)  on 
03.09.2017 while carrying a sack, the  recoveries of various articles from the 
appellants and the motive of the occurrence. 
14.       Firstly, we shall deliberate upon the evidence of the prosecution that after 
the appellant namely Ghulam Shabbir was arrested by  Bashir Ahmad, SI (PW-10) 
on 02.01.2018, he, while in police custody, made a statement detailing therein the 
manner in which he and his co-accused had planned and committed the Qatl-i-Amd 
of Muhammad Ramzan (deceased) and thereafter directed the police to the place of 
the burial of the dead body of the deceased, leading to the recovery of the dead 
body of the deceased on the pointing of the appellant namely Ghulam Shabbir and 
in consequence of that information the dead body was taken into possession 
through recovery memo (Exh. PC). The learned Additional Prosecutor General and 
the learned counsel for the complainant have vehemently argued that as the 
appellant namely Ghulam Shabbir, after his arrest, pointed out the place from 
where the dead body was recovered, hence, the fact of Qatl-i-Amd of Muhammad 
Ramzan (deceased) was discovered in consequence of the information received 
from the appellant namely Ghulam Shabbir in the custody of a police officer, 
therefore, the said pointing of the place of burial of the dead body of the deceased 

Murder Reference No.51 of 2019

and its subsequent recovery by the appellant namely Ghulam Shabbir proved not 
only that Ghulam Shabbir and his co-accused had planned the Qatl-i-Amd of 
Muhammad Ramzan (deceased) but also executed the said plan. We have 
examined the prosecution evidence brought on record with regard to the recovery 
of the dead body on 02.01.2018 and find that the prosecution could not prove 
beyond shadow of doubt that it was indeed the appellant who had got recovered the 
said dead body. In this regard, we have noticed that according to the prosecution 
case itself, photographs (Exh.PD/1-10) were prepared of the place of the recovery 
of the dead body on 02.01.2018 and the said photographs were also produced 
before the learned trial court. In his statement, the prosecution witness namely 
Muhammad Imran (PW-2) stated as under:- 
“Police officer prepared 10 photographs of dead body with official camera and 
took the same into possession vide recovery memo Exh.P-D/1 to 10 attested by 
me and Muhammad Sharif ” 
Similarly, Zubair Ahmad, SI (PW-11), the Investigating Officer of the case, got 
recorded 
in 
his 
statement 
before 
the 
learned 
trial 
court 
that 
the 
photographs(Exh.PD/1-10) of the place of recovery of the dead body were 
prepared and also taken into possession by him. We ourselves have also seen the 
photographs(Exh.PD/1-10) of the place of recovery of the dead body. The most 
conspicuous 
aspect 
of 
the 
evidence 
of 
the 
production 
of 
the 
photographs(Exh.PD/1-10) of the place of recovery of the dead body is that the 
appellant namely Ghulam Shabbir is not at all featured in any of the ten 
photographs (Exh.PD/1-10) of the place of recovery of the dead body, though a 
number of people are seen present at the said place while the body is being 
recovered. It was admitted by Zubair Ahmad, SI (PW-11) that the appellant

Criminal Appeal    No. 287-J of 2019

18 
 
namely Ghulam Shabbir was not at all featured in any of the ten photographs 
(Exh.PD/1-10) of the place of recovery of the dead body. Zubair Ahmad, SI (PW-
11), during cross-examination, admitted as under:- 
“In photographs taken into possession vide .recovery memo Exh. PE (sic), 
accused Ghulam Shabbir is not visible. ” (emphasis supplied)  
The fact that the appellant namely Ghulam Shabbir had never got recovered the 
dead body on 02.01.2018, is further proved by the prosecution evidence itself as 
according to Ghulam Yasin (PW-1) and Muhammad Imran (PW-2), it was the 
appellant namely Ghulam Shabbir who himself dug out the dead body , whereas 
according to Bashir Ahmad, SI (PW-10), an excavator was available at the place of 
occurrence. Ghulam Yasin (PW-1) in his statement before the learned trial court 
stated as under:- 
“Ghulam Shabbir accused himself dug earth 4/5 feet deep and 4/5 feet wide. It 
consumed one and half hour in digging earth and taking out dead body of 
deceased. Ghulam Shabbir dug the earth with Kassi” 
Muhammad Imran (PW-2), in his statement before the learned trial court, stated as 
under:- 
“Ghulam Shabbir accused dug the earth with Kassi. ” 
Bashir Ahmad, SI (PW-10), the Investigating Officer of the case, admitted to the 
presence of the excavator at the place of recovery of the dead body on the day 
when the dead body was discovered. Bashir Ahmad, SI (PW-10), the Investigating 
Officer of the case, admitted during cross-examination  as under:- 

Murder Reference No.51 of 2019

Criminal Appeal    No. 287-J of 2019

19 
 
“Accused Ghulam Shabbir present in the court himself dug the earth which was 
received from people working in the fields with excavator who had also Kassi 
with them ” 
A bare perusal of the photographs (Exh.PD/1-10) of the place of recovery of the 
dead body reveals that an excavator was not only available at the place of the 
recovery of the dead body but the earth was also excavated using the said 
excavator. The relevant photographs out of photographs (Exh.PD/1-10), prove not 
only the absence of the appellant namely Ghulam Shabbir at the place of recovery, 
on the day of the recovery of the dead body but also the use of an excavator to dig 
the earth, are being reproduced under:-

 ” 
We cannot close our eyes to the evidence which has been brought on the record by 
the prosecution itself and which evidence shatters the whole claim of the 
prosecution that it was the appellant Ghulam Shabbir who dug out the dead body 
15.       We have also noted with concern that the prosecution witnesses who 
claimed to have been present at the place of the recovery of the dead body, their 
names were not mentioned in the inquest report (Exh.PP/2) when the same was 
prepared. We have also noted that both the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam 
Yasin (PW-1) and Muhammad Imran (PW-2) were not mentioned either in column 
No.4 of the inquest report (Exh.PP/2) as being the witnesses who had identified the 
dead body of the deceased at the time of preparation of the inquest report 
(Exh.PP/2)   nor were mentioned at page 4 of the inquest report (Exh.PP/2) as 
witnesses who were present at the place of recovery of the dead body at the time of 
preparation of the inquest report (Exh.PP/2). Zubair Ahmed SI (PW-11), the 
Investigating Officer of the case, admitted that the inquest report (Exh.PP/2) was 
not signed by the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yassen (PW-1) and 
Muhammad Imran (PW-2) and stated during cross-examination as under:- 
“I have not obtained signatures of witnesses of identification of dead body in 
inquest report.”

21 
 
 This fact also points towards the absence of the prosecution witnesses namely 
Ghulam Yasin (PW-1) and Muhammad Imran (PW-2) at the place of recovery of 
the dead body at the time of preparation of the inquest report (Exh.PP/2) by Zubair 
Ahmed SI (PW-11) , the Investigating Officer of the case. 
16.  We have also noted with grave concern that both the prosecution witnesses 
namely Ghulam Yasin (PW-1) and Muhammad Imran (PW-2) made substantial  
improvements to their previous statements with regard to the taking of the 
appellant namely  Ghulam Shabbir to the place of the recovery and the arrival of 
the witnesses and the appellant namely Ghulam Shabbir at the said place and the 
recovery of the dead body , however, both the prosecution witnesses namely 
Ghulam Yasin (PW-1) and Muhammad Imran (PW-2) were confronted with their 
previous statements in this regard and  the improvements made by them were 
brought on record. The prosecution witness namely Ghulam Yasin (PW-1) was 
cross-examined and the learned trial court observed as under:- 
“ I got mentioned in my statement before police that when Ghulam Shabbir led 
for recovery of dead body of deceased when we reached in the back side of Dera 
of Tussadaq Shah, accused Ghulam Shabbir asked to stop the official vehicle and 
came out of official vehicle. Confronted with Exh.D-A where factum of 
reaching the back side of Dera of Tussadaq Shah and asking to stop official 
vehicle is not mentioned. I got recorded in my statement that accused Ghulam 
Shabbir in southern side of road at a distance of 200 feet pointed out place where 
dead body of deceased was buried. Confronted with Exh.D-A where distance of 
200 feet and southern side from road is not mentioned. I did not deposed 
before police that at the time of occurrence, there was cotton crop in the field but 
now land is lying vacant. I did not got mentioned in my statement that 
Muhammad Bashir SI took out dead body of deceased from ditch. Accused

22 
 
Ghulam Shabbir that he and Begum Mai be forgiven dead body of Muhammad 
Ramzan recovered. However, I did not get mentioned this fact in my statement 
recorded before police.” (emphasis supplied)  
Muhammad Imran (PW-2) was cross-examined and the learned trial court 
observed as under:- 
“ I also recorded in my statement before the police that accused Ghulam Shabbir 
disclosed that he can get recovered dead body of Muhammad Ramzan. Bashir SI 
accompanied us and accused along with police party on official vehicle to Mouza 
Noor Shah Gillani. Confronted with Exh.D-D where it is not so recorded. I 
also recorded in my statement before the police that accused Shabbir knocked 
official vehicle and said that he had buried dead body of deceased in said land. 
Confronted with Exh.D-D where it is not so recorded. I also recorded in my 
statement before the police. Ghulam Shabbir pointed out place where he had 
buried dead body and asked for Kassi to get recover dead body after digging dead 
body. Confronted with Exh.D-D where it is not so recorded. I also recorded in 
my statement before the police that Bashir Ahmad SI made phone call to Zubair 
SI HIU, who reached there. Zubair Ahmad SI HIU got brought out jute sack from 
ditch which was opened. Confronted with Exh.D-D where it is not so recorded” 
By improving their previous statements, both the prosecution witnesses namely 
Ghulam Yassen (PW-1) and Muhammad Imran (PW-2) impeached their own 
credit. 
17. 
The scrutiny of the prosecution evidence also reveals that though the 
witnesses admitted the presence of a large number of people at the place of the 
recovery of the dead body on 02.01.2018, however, none of those people joined the 
investigation of the case nor appeared before the learned trial court in support of 
the claim of the prosecution that it was the appellant Ghulam Shabbir who dug out 

Murder Reference No.51 of 2019

23 
 
the dead body on 02.01.2018. The prosecution witness namely Ghulam Yasin 
(PW-1) admitted during cross-examination as under:- 
“More than 100 people had gathered at the time of digging earth ” 
However, Bashir Ahmed SI (PW-10) ,the Investigating Officer of the case 
admitted during cross-examination that none of those were present at the place of 
recovery of the dead body were joined in the investigation of the case and stated as 
under:- 
“I did not associate any respectable of locality as no one was ready to become 
witness. I have not mentioned this fact in my any case diary that no one is ready 
to join proceedings. Dead body was recovered from the land of Tussadaq Shah 
but I did not join him in proceeding.” 
Similarly, Zubair Ahmad, SI (PW-11), the other Investigating Officer of the case, 
also admitted during cross-examination ,as under:- 
“On 02.01.2018, I reached Mouza Noor Shah Gillani at 1-30/2-00 pm. Many 
people were present there but I cannot tell the number of people present there. 
Complainant and PWS joined investigation. I also asked to join investigation the 
people who had gathered there but they were not ready to join investigation. I 
have not mentioned this fact in my any case diary. Jute sack was already opened 
before my reaching there. ” 
Article 129 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 provides that if any evidence available 
with the parties is not produced then it shall be presumed that had that evidence 
been produced the same would have been gone against the party producing the 
same. Illustration (g) of the said Article 129 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 
reads as under: - 

Murder Reference No.51 of 2019  
Criminal Appeal    No. 282-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 287-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No.385 of 2021 
 
24 
 
“(g) that evidence which could be and is not produced would, if produced, be 
unfavourable to the person who withholds it.” 
The refusal of the people present at the place of recovery of the dead body to 
appear in support of the prosecution case reflects poorly upon the same and raises 
the likelihood that had the said people appeared as witnesses before the learned 
trial court , they would not have supported the claim of the prosecution regarding 
the recovery of the dead body of the deceased by the appellant namely Ghulam 
Shabbir.  
18. 
As mentioned above, it was also the prosecution case that after  the appellant 
namely Ghulam Shabbir  was arrested by  Bashir Ahmad, SI (PW-10) on 
02.01.2018, he, while in police custody, made a statement detailing therein the 
manner in which he and his co-accused had planned and committed the Qatl-i-Amd 
of Muhammad Ramzan (deceased) and thereafter directed the police to the place of 
the burial of the dead body of the deceased, however, we find that both the 
prosecution witnesses namely  Ghulam Yasin (PW-1) and Muhammad Imran (PW-
2)  admitted to had made substantial improvements in their previous statements 
and admitted that their assertions of the appellant namely Ghulam Shabbir making 
a confession in police custody of planning and committing the Qatl-i-Amd of 
Muhammad Ramzan (deceased) was not mentioned by them in their previous 
statements. The prosecution witness namely Ghulam Yasin (PW-1), admitted 
during cross-examination as under:- 
“I got recorded in my statement recorded on 02.01.2018 that accused Ghulam 
Shabbir made disclosure that he committed murder of my brother Muhammad 
Ramzan since deceased. Confronted with Exh.D-A where it is not so recorded. 
I also got recorded in my statement on 02.01.2018 that accused Ghulam Shabbir

where it is not so recorded. I also got recorded in my statement that Ghulam

during course of investigation. It is incorrect to suggest that volunteered portion of 
my statement is false. I also did not get mentioned in my statement that 
Ghulam Shabbir stated that he can get recovered dead body of deceased.”

The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Imran (PW-2), admitted during cross-
examination as under:- 
“ I recorded in my statement on 02.01.2018 that Bashir SI made phone call to 
Ghulam Yasin and told about arrest of Ghulam Shabbir accused. I recorded in my

In this manner, it was proved during cross-examination that the prosecution 
witnesses namely Ghulam Yasin (PW-1) and Muhammad Imran (PW-2) had 
blatantly and dishonestly improved their previous statements wherein no such facts 
had been recorded . Article 151  of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984 provides as 
under:- 
"151. Impeaching credit of witness. The credit of a witness may be impeached in the following 
ways by the adverse party, or, with the consent of the Court, by the party who calls him: 
(1) by the evidence of persons who testify that they, from their knowledge of the 
witness,believe him to be un worthy of credit; 
(2) by proof that the witness has been bribed, or has accepted the offer of a bribe, or has 
received any other corrupt inducement to give his evidence ; 
(3) by proof of former statements inconsistent with any part of his evidence which is liable 
to be contradicted ;" 
By improving their previous statements, the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam 
Yasin (PW-1) and Muhammad Imran (PW-2) impeached their own credit. The 
august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the cases of "Muhammad Ashraf Vs. State" 
(2012 SCMR 419), "Muhammad Mansha Vs. The State" (2018 SCMR 772) and 
Muhammad Arif Vs. The State (2019 SCMR 631) took a serious notice of the 
improvements introduced by witnesses and rejected their evidence.  
19.   We have also noted that though the dead body allegedly was  got recovered 
on 02.01.2018 and was brought to the hospital at 08.00 p.m, however, the police 
papers were produced before Dr.Aihsan Ali (PW-6) with substantial delay on 
03.08.2018 at 08.00 a.m.  Dr.Aihsan Ali (PW-6), in his statement before the 
learned trial court, stated as under:- 

Murder Reference No.51 of 2019

“Dead body of deceased Muhammad Ramzan son of Muhammad Sharif caste 
Jamoo, aged 25/30 years approximately r/o Chak. No.17/M Tehsil Dunyapur 
District, Lodhran was received at dead house at THQ Hospital, Dunyapur on 
02.01.2018 at 8-00 pm.  
…………………. 
Complete police papers were received on 03.01.2018 at 8-00 am and I 
conducted the autopsy of the deceased on the same at 8-30 am on the same 
day. ” (emphasis supplied)  
The reason which is apparent for the delayed submission of the police papers was 
that the said time was taken to prepare documents and create false statements with 
regard to the alleged statement of the appellant namely Ghulam Shabbir, made by 
him in police custody with regard to the planning and the commission of the Qatl-
i-Amd of Muhammad Ramzan deceased and the procuring of witnesses to prove 
the recovery of the dead body by the appellant namely Ghulam Shabbir, both 
which efforts of the prosecution were exposed as being sham. There was no reason, 
other than the ones mentioned above, for the delayed submission of the police 
papers to Dr. Aihsan Ali (PW-6). In this manner, the prosecution failed to prove 
that the appellant namely Ghulam Shabbir, after his arrest on 02.01.2018, made a 
statement detailing the planning and execution of the plan regarding the Qatl-i-
Amd of Muhammad Ramzan (deceased) and that he also got recovered the dead 
body. 
20. 
 The learned Additional Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the 
complainant have also placed reliance on the statements of the prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Ismail (PW-3) and Muhammad Rashid (PW-4)  that 
the said witnesses had seen the appellant namely Ghulam Shabbir on 03.09.2017 at 

Murder Reference No.51 of 2019

about 11.45 p.m. while carrying a sack, plying on a motorcycle and submitted that 
the sack which was seen by the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ismail 
(PW-3) and Muhammad Rashid (PW-4) contained the dead body of the deceased 
and therefore proved a relevant fact of the prosecution case. We have scrutinized 
the statements of the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ismail (PW-3) and 
Muhammad Rashid (PW-4) and find that they are not worthy of any reliance. Both 
the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ismail (PW-3) and Muhammad 
Rashid (PW-4) claimed to have seen the appellant namely Ghulam Shabbir on 
03.09.2017 at about 11.45 p.m. while carrying a sack, plying on a motorcycle, 
however, did not make any statement either to the police nor revealed the said fact 
to the complainant of the case, who had been searching for his brother since 
03.09.2017. The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ismail (PW-3) admitted 
during cross-examination, as under:- 
“ From 03.09.2017 to 04.01.2018, I did not inform police about carrying of jute 
sack on motorcycle.” (emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Rashid (PW-4), admitted during 
cross-examination, as under:- 
“We did not make any hue and cry not tried to apprehend them. We did not 
inform police on 03.09.2017. ” 
It is trite that the delayed recording of the statement of a prosecution witness under 
section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 reduces its value to nothing 
unless there is plausible explanation for such delay. No explanation, much less 
plausible, has been given by both the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad 
Ismail (PW-3) and Muhammad Rashid (PW-4) for them not getting their 

Murder Reference No.51 of 2019

Criminal Appeal    No.385 of 2021 
 
33 
 
statements under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 recorded 
immediately and therefore no value can be attached to their statements. The august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Abdul Khaliq Vs. The State” (1996 
SCMR 1553) has held as under: 
“It is a settled position of law that late recording of 161, Cr.P.C. 
statement of a prosecution witness reduces its value to nill unless there is 
plausible explanation for such delay”.  
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Muhammad Khan Vs. Maula 
Bakhsh” (1998 SCMR 570) has held as under: 
“It is a settled law that credibility of a witness is looked with serious 
suspicion if his statement under section 161, Cr.P.C is recorded with delay 
without offering any plausible explanation”.  
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Syed Saeed Muhammad 
Shah and another Vs. The State” (1993 SCMR 550) at page 571 has held as under: 
“In the absence of satisfactory nature of explanation normally rule is that 
statements recorded by police after delay and without explanation are to 
be ruled out of consideration. In this case unsatisfactory explanation 
which is not substantiated can be equated with no explanation”.  
Furthermore, the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ismail (PW-3) and 
Muhammad Rashid (PW-4) admitted that during the course of the investigation, 
they did not show to the Investigating Officer of the case the place where they had 
allegedly seen the appellant namely Ghulam Shabbir on 03.09.2017. The 
prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ismail (PW-3), admitted during cross-
examination, as under:- 

Murder Reference No.51 of 2019  
Criminal Appeal    No. 282-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 287-J of 2019

34 
 
“We did not show the place to I/O where we witnessed accused taking jute sack 
on motorcycle. ” 
Zubair Ahmad, SI (PW-11), the Investigating Officer of the case, also admitted 
during cross-examination , as under:- 
“On 05.01.2018, Ismail and Rashid appeared before me and I recorded their 
statements u/s 161 Cr.P.C. They did not appear prior to this before police. I did not 
visit the place where they witnessed accused taking jute sack on motorcycle nor I 
prepared rough site plan of said place. I did not collect copy of Warabandi from 
Ismail and Rashid PWS. ” 
In this manner, the statements of the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad 
Ismail (PW-3) and Muhammad Rashid (PW-4) have no evidentiary value. 
21. 
We have also noted that the very question of the identity of the dead body 
which was recovered could not be proved by the prosecution. It was the 
prosecution case itself that the dead body was recovered in pieces as contained in 
five separate plastic bags, which plastic bags had then been put in a jute bag. 
According to the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yasin (PW-1) and 
Muhammad Imran (PW-2) they had identified the dead body from the watch which 
was worn by the dead body , shalwar, taweez and one side of the face which was 
identifiable. The prosecution witness namely Ghulam Yasin (PW-1) in his 
statement before the learned trial court , stated as under:- 
“I along with Muhammad Sharif and Imran PWS identified the dead body of 
deceased Muhammad Ramzan from his watch, shalwar, Taveez & one side of his 
face which was identifiable ” 
Similarly, the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Imran (PW-2) , in his 
statement before the learned trial court , stated as under:- 

Murder Reference No.51 of 2019  
Criminal Appeal    No. 282-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 287-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No.385 of 2021 
 
35 
 
“I along with Muhammad Sharif and Ghulam Yasin identified dead body of 
Muhammad Ramzan from Taveez, Shalwar, wrist watch and some part of face 
which were identifiable ” 
A perusal of the prosecution evidence reveals that the identity of the dead body 
could not have been made by the indicators which, according to the prosecution 
witnesses namely Ghulam Yasin (PW-1) and Muhammad Imran (PW-2), they had 
used to identify the dead body. Both the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam 
Yasin (PW-1) and Muhammad Ismail (PW-3) stated that some part of the face of 
the dead body was identifiable and for that reason, they were able to identify the 
same as being that of Muhammad Ramzan (deceased), however, Dr. Aihsan Ali 
(PW-6), who conducted the post mortem examination of the dead body of the 
deceased, was of the opinion that for the fact that the head was crushed and the 
face bones were also crushed and missing, therefore, the dead body was not 
identifiable. Dr. Aihsan Ali (PW-6), in his statement before the learned trial court, 
stated as under:- 
“ Head was crushed and un-identifiable, by face because face bones were crushed 
and missing, skull of head was also crushed at various sides and empty of brain.. 
………….. 
As head of deceased was crushed, hence circumference of head of deceased could 
not be taken 
…………. 
It is correct that face bones of deceased were missing and crushed, hence 
were un-identifiable.” (emphasis supplied)

Criminal Appeal    No. 287-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No.385 of 2021 
 
36 
 
Even the prosecution witness namely Ghulam Yasin (PW-1) himself admitted 
during cross-examination that he had not stated that a part of the face of the dead 
body was identifiable and stated as under:- 
“I also did not record in my statement that one side of face of dead body was 
identifiable ” 
In this manner, the claim of the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yasin (PW-
1) and Muhammad Ismail (PW-3) that they had identified the dead body from a 
part of its face was contradicted by Dr. Aihsan Ali (PW-6). Then the prosecution 
witnesses namely Ghulam Yasin (PW-1) and Muhammad Ismail (PW-3) also 
claimed that they had identified the dead body of the deceased due to the Taweez 
(Amulet) which was present on the dead body of the deceased , however, this claim 
was also contradicted by Dr. Aihsan Ali (PW-6) who stated that he had not found 
any Taweez (Amulet) which was present on the dead body of the deceased at the 
time of post mortem examination. Dr. Aihsan Ali (PW-6) admitted during cross-
examination  as under:- 
“ I have not mentioned factum of "Taveez" in external examination of dead body” 
With regard to the claim of the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Yasin (PW-
1) and Muhammad Ismail (PW-3) that they had identified the dead body of the 
deceased with the help of a watch and a shalwar, we find that both the said articles 
were not produced before the learned trial court so as to determine whether they 
were of such unique features that they could have belonged only to the deceased. 
Furthermore, Zubair Ahmad, SI (PW-11), who prepared the inquest report 
(Exh.PP/1)  admitted during cross-examination that the columns relating to the 
availability of any article on the dead body at the time of its recovery or the 

Murder Reference No.51 of 2019  
Criminal Appeal    No. 282-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 287-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No.385 of 2021 
 
37 
 
columns related to the identification of the dead body had no entries made in them. 
Zubair Ahmad, SI (PW-11), admitted during cross-examination, as under:- 
“I also prepared inquest report. In column No.8 & 9 of inquest report, I have 
mentioned as putrefied. Column of identification of dead body of inquest report is 
blank. Column No.14,15,16,18,19 & 21 of inquest report are blank. ” 
We have also noted that according to the prosecution witness namely Khan 
Bahadar 4/HC (PW-8), on 03.01.2018, Zubair Ahmad, SI (PW-11) handed over to 
him eight sealed Jars, three sealed envelopes, a sealed parcel said to contain a 
watch, Taweez, sack and a shalwar and five other plastic bags which on 
11.01.2018  he handed over to Zubair Ahmad, SI (PW-11)  for their onward 
transmission to the office of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore, 
however, the prosecution withheld the report of the Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore with regard to the analysis of the  shalwar, taweez (amulet) and 
the watch and it has not been explained as to whether the said articles ever reached 
the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore  and as mentioned above, the said 
shalwar, taweez (amulet) and the watch were never produced before the learned 
trial court . In this manner, all the indicators which according to the prosecution 
witnesses namely  Ghulam Yasin (PW-1) and Muhammad Imran (PW-2)  were 
used by them to identify the dead body were either not available or their presence 
was not proved.  Furthermore, it was admitted by Zubair Ahmad, SI (PW-11) , the 
Investigating Officer of the case , that  he had taken Ghulam Yasin (PW-1) , the 
brother of the deceased to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore so as to 
establish the identity of the dead body and on 12.01.2018, the samples of Ghulam 
Yasin (PW-1) were also submitted to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore 

Murder Reference No.51 of 2019

Criminal Appeal    No. 287-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No.385 of 2021 
 
38 
 
for the determination of the identity of the dead body. Zubair Ahmad, SI (PW-11) , 
in his statement before the learned trial court , stated as under:- 
“ On 12.01.2018, I submitted parcels relating to case in PFSA Lahore intact which 
Moharrer handed over to me on 11.01.2018. On the same day, DNA test of 
complainant/brother of deceased was also conducted for identification of 
deceased at PFSA Lahore” 
The above portion of the cross-examination of Zubair Ahmad, SI (PW-11) proves 
that had the identity of the dead body which was recovered on 02.01.2018 been 
established, then there was no need for taking the prosecution witness namely 
Ghulam Yasin (PW-1) to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore on 
12.01.2018 for the purpose of determining the identity of the dead body. 
Furthermore, the said report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore 
regarding the determination of the identity of the dead body was never produced 
before the learned trial court raising the apparent reason for its withholding being 
that had it been produced, the same would have gone against the prosecution case.  
In this manner, the very question as to whose body was recovered on 02.01.2018 
was not proved by the prosecution with any certainty.  
22. 
We have also noted that the prosecution failed to prove, with any decree of 
certainty , the cause of death of the deceased. The prosecution witnesses namely 
Ghulam Yasin (PW-1) and Muhammad Imran (PW-2) had claimed that the 
appellant namely Ghulam Shabbir had made a statement that he had sent some 
tranquillizer to the appellant namely Begum Bibi,  for her to administer it to the 
deceased and when the appellant namely Begum Bibi,  had allegedly administered 
the said sedatives to the deceased and he became unconscious, the appellant 
namely Ghulam Shabbir then arrived at the house of deceased, however, according 

Murder Reference No.51 of 2019  
Criminal Appeal    No. 282-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 287-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No.385 of 2021 
 
39 
 
to the report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh. PV), no drugs 
or poison were detected in the liver and stomach contents sent to it. The relevant 
portion of the report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh. PV) 
reads as under:- 
“ Results and Conclusion: 
Drugs/poisons are not detected in liver and stomach contents in item # 01.” 
Furthermore, we have also noticed that though Dr. Aihsan Ali (PW-6) has opined 
that the injuries which he observed on the dead body were anti-mortem in nature, 
however, the report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh. PW) 
mentioned that none of the injuries was ante-mortem. Dr. Aihsan Ali (PW-6) 
during cross-examination admitted that at the time of post-mortem examination of 
the dead body, he had not opined regarding the injuries being ante-,mortem or 
post-mortem, however, had based his opinion on the report of the Punjab Forensic 
Science Agency, Lahore (Exh. PW). Dr. Aihsan Ali (PW-6) during cross-
examination, stated as under:- 
“It is correct that in initial post mortem report, I have not mentioned the injuries 
as ante-mortem or post mortem. Volunteered, as final opinion was subject to 
reports of PFSA and Labs. hence, in my final opinion that the injuries were ante- 
mortem” 
We find that Dr. Aihsan Ali (PW-6) fell in error while perusing the report of the 
Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PW) and concluding that the 
injuries observed by him were ante mortem for the fact that in the report of the 
Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PW)  it was clearly mentioned that 

Murder Reference No.51 of 2019  
Criminal Appeal    No. 282-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 287-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No.385 of 2021 
 
40 
 
there was no evidence of any ante mortem injury. The relevant portion of the report 
of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PW) reads as under:- 
“ Forensic Histopathology Examination & Conclusion Report 
Histological examination of the submitted neck tissue reveals blood 
haemorrhages, and tissue necrosis suggesting antemortem nature of injury. 
Histological examination of sections from cervical vertebrae reveals bone, no 
Ante-Mortem injury seen”(emphasis supplied)  
In this manner, we have reached an irresistible conclusion that the prosecution 
failed to even prove the cause of death of the deceased.  
23. 
The learned Additional Prosecutor General  and the learned counsel for the 
complainant have also relied upon the recovery of the blood stained earth by the 
appellant namely Ghulam Shabbir on 03.01.2018 from the place where the 
deceased was done to death and have submitted that the said recovery also was a 
relevant fact. In this regard we have noticed that the said blood stained earth was 
allegedly recovered on 03.01.2018 from the house of the deceased, however, it was 
admitted by the prosecution witness namely Ghulam Yasin (PW-1) that the 
deceased had three children of various ages living with him at the time of his death 
but the said children were not joined in the investigation of the case. The 
prosecution witness namely Ghulam Yasin (PW-1) admitted as under:- 
“Marriage of Begum Mai was contracted with Muhammad Ramzan 10/12 years 
ago and from their wedlock, three children were born. Elder daughter of 
Muhammad Ramzan is aged about 9/10 years whereas the other daughter is aged 
about 7 years and younger son is aged about 6 years. Neither police joined the 
above said children in investigation nor we produced them before the police ”

Criminal Appeal    No. 287-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No.385 of 2021 
 
41 
 
Had the occurrence taken place inside the house of the deceased then it must have 
been witnessed by the said children, however, the said children were not joined in 
the investigation of the case and the prosecution withheld the best evidence 
available in the case. Furthermore, it has been noticed that though the said blood 
stained earth was taken into possession through recovery memo (Exh.PF)  and 
according to the statement of Khan Bahadar 4/HC (PW-8)  he had handed over the 
said sealed parcel to Zubair Ahmad, SI (PW-11) for its onward transmission to the 
office of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore, however, no report of the 
Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore was produced by the prosecution during 
the course of the trial.   In this manner, there is no evidence on record that what 
was recovered on 03.01.2018 was indeed the blood stained earth and the blood was 
that of the deceased. In this manner, the recovery of the blood stained earth by the 
appellant namely Ghulam Shabbir on 03.01.2018 proves no relevant fact or any 
fact in issue.  
24. 
The learned Additional Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the 
complainant have also relied upon the recovery of the motorcycle (P-2) from the 
appellant namely Ghulam Shabbir and have submitted that it was the same 
motorcycle which was used by the appellant to take the dead body of the deceased 
to its burial place. We have noticed that the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Ismail (PW-3) and Muhammad Rashid (PW-4), in their statements 
before the learned trial court, did not state either the make or the colour or the 
registration number or the model number of the motorcycle upon which they had 
allegedly seen  the appellant namely Ghulam Shabbir  carrying a sack , therefore, 
the recovered motorcycle (P-2) cannot be said to be the same on which he was seen

riding on 03.09.2017 by the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ismail 
(PW-3) and Muhammad Rashid (PW-4) and hence, proves no fact. 
 
25.    The learned Additional Prosecutor General  and the learned counsel for the 
complainant have also relied upon the recovery of the Kassi (P-3)  and Gandasa 
(P-4) from the appellant namely Ghulam Shabbir and have stated that the said 
recovery also provided support of the prosecution case. With regard to the recovery 
of Kassi from the appellant Ghulam Shabbir on 07.01.2018, it was observed by the 
learned trial court that the word Kassi was not mentioned in the statement of the 
prosecution witness namely Muhammad Imran (PW-2) recorded on 07.01.2018 
and obvious manipulation had been made in this regard. The learned trial court , 
during the cross-examination of Muhammad Imran (PW-2) , observed as under:- 
“I also recorded in my statement before the police that I/O took into possession 
Kassi with which after digging earth dead body of deceased was recovered. 
Learned counsel for accused stated that copy of statement of Muhammad Imran 
recorded u/s 161 Cr.P.C does not bear factum of mentioning Kassi. Learned 
DDPP for state produced carbon copy of statement of Muhammad Imran 
recorded u/s 161 Cr.P.C on 07.01.2018 in which Kassi is mentioned but the 
same is apparently subsequently added because hand writing and last line in 
statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C is different ” (emphasis supplied)  
The said observation of the learned trial court is in itself sufficient to prove the 
sham nature of the recovery of the Kassi (P-3). With regard to the recovery of the 
Gandasa (P-4) from the appellant Ghulam Shabbir on 11.01.2018, it has been 
observed that the said Gandasa (P-4) was never sent to the Punjab Forensic 
Science Agency, Lahore for analysis and therefore, its recovery is inconsequential. 
Moreover, the said Gandasa (P-4) was recovered on 11.01.2018 from the same

house from where the blood stained earth had been taken into possession on 
03.01.2018.  Zubair Ahmad, SI (PW-11), the Investigating Officer of the case  had 
already visited the place of the recovery of the blood stained earth on 03.01.2018 
and had spent a substantial time present there and had the  Gandasa (P-4) been also 
present within the same vicinity, then its presence would have been detected by 
Zubair Ahmad, SI (PW-11) even on 03.01.2018, however it was not which proves 
that only a false proceeding was created and actually nothing was got recovered by 
the appellant namely Ghulam Shabbir on 11.01.2018. 
26. 
The learned Additional Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the 
complainant have also relied upon the recovery of the Mobile phone (P-5) and two 
Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards (P-6 and P-7) from the appellant namely 
Ghulam Shabbir on 15.01.2018. Zubair Ahmad, SI (PW-11), the Investigating 
Officer of the case, admitted during cross-examination that he did not get the 
identity of the mobile phone (P-5) established as the International Mobile 
Equipment Identity(IMEI) number of the recovered mobile phone (P-5) was not 
readable. Zubair Ahmad, SI (PW-11), during cross-examination, as under:- 
“In Exh.P-K it is mentioned that IMEI of recovered mobile P-5 is not readable 
…………….. 
 I did not try to trace IMEI number of mobile P-5. I did not prepare any "Fard-
Shanakht" P-5.” 
With regard to the recovery of the two Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards (P-
6 and P-7) from the appellant namely Ghulam Shabbir on 15.01.2018, Zubair 
Ahmad, SI (PW-11), the Investigating Officer of the case, admitted that he had not

taken into possession any document so as to prove that in whose names the two 
Subscriber Identity Module cards (P-6 and P-7) were registered. Zubair Ahmad, SI 
(PW-11), admitted during cross-examination, as under:- 
“ I got confirmed ownership of SIMS from mobile companies. I did not obtain 
written certificate in this regard. I also did not record statement of official of 
mobile company in this regard ” 
27. 
The learned Additional Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the 
complainant have also relied upon the recovery of the hatchet (P-1) from the 
appellant namely Begum Bibi on 04.01.2018. With regard to the recovery of the 
hatchet (P-1) from the appellant namely Begum Bibi on 04.01.2018, it has been 
observed that the said hatchet (P-1) was never sent to the Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore for analysis and therefore, its recovery is inconsequential. 
Moreover, the said hatchet (P-1) was recovered on 04.01.2018 from the same 
house from where the blood stained earth had been taken into possession on 
03.01.2018.  Zubair Ahmad, SI (PW-11) had already visited the place of the 
recovery of the blood stained earth on 03.01.2018 and had spent a substantial time 
present there and had the hatchet (P-1) been also present within the same area, then 
its presence would have been observed by Zubair Ahmad, SI (PW-11) even on 
03.01.2018, however it was not which proves that only a dishonest proceeding was 
created and actually nothing was got recovered by the appellant namely Begum 
Bibi on 04.01.2018. 
28.     The prosecution has also relied upon the Call Data Record collected during 
the investigation of the case so as to prove the guilt of the appellants. With regard 
to the allegation against the appellant namely Ghulam Shabbir that he had used a

Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) registered in his name to make a call from the 
mobile phone device of the deceased, it has been admitted by the prosecution 
witnesses that no evidence was produced during the investigation of the case to 
establish the identity of the mobile phone device under the use of the deceased.  
The prosecution witness namely Ghulam Yasin (PW-1), admitted during cross-
examination , as under:- 
“I did not submit any application to police regarding the manufacturing company 
or model of mobile of deceased. I did not produce any purchase receipt of said 
mobile to the police ” 
Similarly, Bashir Ahmad, SI (PW-10), the Investigating Officer of the case also 
admitted during cross-examination, as under:- 
“Complainant did not produce any purchase receipt of mobile by deceased. 
Complainant also did not record any statement giving detail and description of 
mobile owned by deceased. I obtained CDR of mobile officially but did not get 
verify SIMs from any telecommunication company ” 
Furthermore, Ghulam Yasin (PW-1) also admitted that in his written application 
(Exh. PB) submitted by him for the registration of the F.I.R, it had not been 
mentioned that the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) registered in the name of the 
accused was used for making a call from the mobile phone device of the deceased. 
The prosecution witness namely Ghulam Yasin (PW-1), during cross-examination, 
admitted as under:- 
“In application Exh.P-B, it was not mentioned that Sims were used in Mobile 
phone of Ramzan on 07.12.2017. Mobile phone of Muhammad Bilal accused 
0308-2863832 was mentioned in application Exh.P-B, confronted with Exh.P-B

where it is not so recorded. Mobile No.0302-9895921 was not mentioned in 
Exh.P-B ” (emphasis supplied)  
According to the prosecution case, Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) having 
Mobile No.0302-9895921 was registered in the name of the appellant namely 
Ghulam Shabbir, but, as mentioned above, despite the fact that the written 
application (Exh.PB) was submitted on 20.12.2017, however, in the same it had 
not been mentioned that the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) having Mobile 
No.0302-9895921 was used to make a call from the mobile phone device of the 
deceased. It was also admitted by Zubair Ahmad, SI (PW-11) that the Call Data 
Record taken into possession by him on 15.01.2018 through recovery memo 
(Exh.PL)/1-52 did not bear the signatures of the issuing authority. Zubair Ahmad, 
SI (PW-11) admitted during cross-examination as under:- 
“ On 15.01.2018, I collected mobile data vide recovery PL memo Exh.P-L. 
Mobile data does not bear any signatures of issuing authority. I also did not record 
any statement of Telecommunication Company.” 
Furthermore, no Call Data Record of the mobile phone device under the use of 
Begum Bibi was obtained nor even the mobile number of any Subscriber Identity 
Module (SIM) registered in the name of the appellant namely Begum Bibi was 
produced before the Investigating Officer of the case, during the investigation of 
the case. Bashir Ahmad, SI (PW-10), the Investigating Officer of the case, 
admitted during the cross-examination , as under:- 
“ No mobile number of Begum Mai accused was produced to me by complainant 
or PWS. ”

It is also stressed again that in the absence of any voice call data or record, simply 
the production of the Call Data Record without the disclosure of the details of the 
conversation is not relevant to prove any fact supporting the prosecution case 
against the appellants.  Considering the above-mentioned facts in the given 
circumstances discussed above, doubt is created in the prosecution case, the benefit 
of which cannot be denied to the appellant.  Reliance is placed on the case of 
“Azeem Khan and another Vs. Mujahid Khan and others” (2016 SCMR 274), 
wherein, it has been held as under:- 
“The cell phone call data collected is of no help to the prosecution for 
the reasons that numerous calls have been made indicating continuous 
interaction between the two cell phones, contrary to the evidence given 
by Muhammad Wali (PW-3), who has stated at the trial that the 
unknown caller made calls on his cell phone four times. No competent 
witness was produced at the trial, who provided the call data, Ex.P-1 to 
Ex.P-5. No voice record transcript has been brought on record. 
Similarly from which area the caller made the calls, is also not shown 
in it. Above all, the most crucial and conclusive proof that the cell 
phone was owned by the accused and SIM allotted was in his name is 
also missing. In this view of the matter, this piece of evidence is 
absolutely inconclusive and of no benefit to the prosecution nor it 
connects the accused with the crime in any manner.” 
 
 29. 
The learned Additional Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the 
complainant have also relied upon the evidence of motive and submitted that it 
corroborated the ocular account. The motive of the occurrence as stated by 
prosecution witnesses was that the appellant namely Ghulam Shabbir had 
developed an illicit liaison with the appellant namely Begum Bibi and as the 
deceased was a hindrance in the continuation of the said intimacy between the 
appellants namely Ghulam Shabbir and Begum Bibi, therefore, he was murdered. 
We have perused the statements of the prosecution witnesses and find that they 
failed to prove the motive of the occurrence as stated by them.  The prosecution 
witness namely Ghulam Yasin (PW-1) was found to have improved his statement 

Murder Reference No.51 of 2019  
Criminal Appeal    No. 282-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 287-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No.385 of 2021 
 
48 
 
with regard to the motive of the occurrence and the said improvement was duly 
brought on record during the course of his cross-examination and the learned trial 
court observed as under:- 
“ I also got recorded in my statement on 02.01.2018 that accused Ghulam Shabbir 
admitted that he had illicit relations with Begum Mai accused and used to visit the 
house of deceased in connection of illicit relations. Confronted with Exh.D-A, 
where it is not so recorded” 
Furthermore, Zubair Ahmad, SI (PW-11), the Investigating Officer of the case 
,also admitted that he did not collect any evidence with regard to the alleged 
motive of the occurrence. It has also been brought on record that the deceased and 
the appellant namely Begum Bibi had been married for a period of 10-12 years 
before the occurrence and had also been blessed with the birth of three children. 
There is no evidence on record that Muhammad Ramzan son of Muhammad Sharif 
(deceased) was facing any threat to his life at the hands of the appellants prior to 
the occurrence. The prosecution witnesses failed to provide evidence enabling us 
to determine the truthfulness of the motive alleged and the fact that the said motive 
was so compelling that it could have led the appellants namely Ghulam Shabbir 
and Begum Bibi to have committed the Qatl-i-Amd of the deceased. There is a 
poignant hush with regard to the particulars of the motive alleged. No independent 
witness was produced by the prosecution to prove the motive as alleged. Even 
otherwise a tainted piece of evidence cannot corroborate another tainted piece of 
evidence. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in the case of 
"Muhammad Javed v. The State" (2016 SCMR 2021) as under: 
"The said related and chance witnesses had failed to receive any 
independent corroboration inasmuch as no independent proof of the 

Murder Reference No.51 of 2019  
Criminal Appeal    No. 282-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 287-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal    No.385 of 2021 
 
49 
 
motive set up by the prosecution had been brought on the record of the 
case." 
 
30.      Considering all the above circumstances, we entertain serious doubt in our 
minds regarding the involvement of the appellants namely Ghulam Shabbir son of 
Karim Bakhsh and Begum Bibi daughter of Muhammad Ilyas in the present case. 
It is a settled principle of law that for giving the benefit of the doubt it is not 
necessary that there should be so many circumstances rather, if only a single 
circumstance creating reasonable doubt in the mind of a prudent person is 
available, then such benefit is to be extended to an accused not as a matter of 
concession but as of right. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of 
"Muhammad Mansha Vs. The State" (2018 SCMR 772) has enunciated the 
following principle: 
"Needless to mention that while giving the benefit of doubt to an accused it 
is not necessary that there should be many circumstances creating doubt. 
If there is a circumstance which creates reasonable doubt in a prudent 
mind about the guilt of the accused, then the accused would be entitled to 
the benefit of such doubt, not as a matter of grace and concession, but as a 
matter of right. It is based on the maxim, "it is better that ten guilty 
persons be acquitted rather than one innocent person be convicted". 
Reliance in this behalf can be made upon the cases of Tariq Pervez v. The 
State (1995 SCMR 1345), Ghulam Qadir and 2 others v. The State (2008 
SCMR 1221), Muhammad Akramv.The State (2009 SCMR 230) and 
Muhammad Zamanv.The State (2014 SCMR 749)." 
 
Reliance is also placed on the judgment of the august Supreme Court of Pakistan 
"Najaf Ali Shah Vs. the State" (2021 S C M R 736) in which it has been held as:- 
"9. 
Mere heinousness of the offence if not proved to the hilt is not a 
ground to avail the majesty of the court to do complete justice. This is 
an established principle of law and equity that it is better that 100 
guilty persons should let off but one innocent person should not suffer. 
As the preeminent English jurist William Blackstone wrote, "Better that 
ten guilty persons escape, than that one innocent suffer." Benjamin 
Franklin, who was one of the leading figures of early American history, 
went further arguing "it is better a hundred guilty persons should 
escape than one innocent person should suffer." All the contradictions 
noted by the learned High Court are sufficient to cast a shadow of 
doubt on the prosecution's case, which entitles the petitioner to the 
right of benefit of the doubt. It is a well settled principle of law that for

50 
 
the accused to be afforded this right of the benefit of the doubt it is not 
necessary that there should be many circumstances creating 
uncertainty and if there is only one doubt, the benefit of the same must 
got to the petitioner. This Court in the case of Mst. Asia Bibi v. The 
State (PLD 2019 SC 64) while relying on the the earlier judgments of 
this Court has categorically held that "if a single circumstance creates 
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the apprehension of guilt of 
an accused, then he/she shall be entitled to such benefit not as a matter 
of grace and concession, but as of right. Reference in this regard may 
be made to the cases of Tariq Pervaiz v. The State (1998 SCMR 1345) 
and Ayub Masih v. The State (PLD 2002 SC 1048)." The same view was 
reiterated in Abdul Jabbar v. State (2010 SCMR 129) when this court 
observed that once a single loophole is observed in a case presented by 
the prosecution, such as conflict in the ocular account and medical 
evidence or presence of eye-witnesses being doubtful, the benefit of 
such loophole/lacuna in the prosecution's case automatically goes in 
favour of an accused." 
 
31.  
 For what has been discussed above the Criminal Appeal No.282-J of 2019 
lodged by Ghulam Shabbir son of Karim Bakhsh  (appellant) is  allowed and the 
conviction and sentences of the appellant namely Ghulam Shabbir awarded by the 
learned trial court through the impugned judgment dated 05.04.2019 are hereby

of Muhammad Ilyas  (appellant) is  also allowed and the conviction and sentences 
of the appellant namely Begum Bibi daughter of Muhammad Ilyas awarded by the 
learned trial court through the impugned judgment dated 05.04.2019 are hereby 
set-aside. Both the appellants namely Ghulam Shabbir son of Karim Bakhsh and 
Begum Bibi daughter of Muhammad Ilyas are ordered to be acquitted by extending 
them the benefit of doubt. Ghulam Shabbir son of Karim Bakhsh and Begum Bibi 
daughter of Muhammad Ilyas are in custody and they are directed to be released 
forthwith if not required in any other case. 
32.
