Feeling aggrieved by the judgment of the learned trial 
court, the appellant-Asjad Mehmood, has assailed his conviction 
and sentence by filing an appeal bearing Crl. Appeal No.44525-J 
of 2019. The learned trial court also referred M.R. No.100 of 2019 
(The State. Vs. Asjad Mehmood) to confirm the death sentence 
awarded to the appellant-Asjad Mehmood, as both the matters 
arising from the same judgment of the learned trial court are being 
disposed of through this consolidated judgment. 
3. 
 
Briefly, the prosecution story as alleged in the F.I.R (Ex. 
PC) lodged on the application (Ex. PA) of Maqsood Bibi (PW-1)-the 
complainant is that on 20.12.2009, the daughter of the complainant, 
namely 
Babra 
Bibi 
(since 
dead) 
called 
the 
complainant 
telephonically that the accused-Asjad Mehmood was quarreling 
with her every day after that the complainant reached the house of 
her daughter along with her “bhanja” namely Atif Annayat to see 
her daughter. When the complainant reached her daughter’s 
house, the accused started quarreling with Maqsood Bibi (PW-1) 
and her “bhanja.” After that, at about 4/5 a.m., the accused-Asjad 
Mehmood, called Babra Bibi (since dead), who came out of the 
room. The complainant and others also went out of the room. The 
accused-Asjad Mehmood, armed with a rifle, made fire shots, 
which hit the belly and chest of Babra Bibi (since dead), who 
succumbed to the injuries on the spot. The alleged occurrence was 
witnessed by Maqsood Bibi (PW-1)-the complainant, Sohail (PW-
2), and Atif Annayat.  
4. 
 
The motive behind the occurrence was a domestic 
dispute between the accused-Asjad Mehmood, and his brother 
Amjad Mehmood (husband of the deceased, Babra Bibi), due to 
which the alleged occurrence took place.  
5. 
 
The complainant-Maqsood Bibi (PW-1), reported the 
incident to local police through Fard Bayan (Ex. PA) after that 

M.R No.100 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.44525-J of 2019 
 
 
3
formal FIR (Ex. PC) was chalked out by Wasif Hussain, S.I (PW-4). 
After the registration of the case, firstly, the investigation of this 
case was entrusted to Muhammad Khan Ranjha, SI (PW-9). After 
that, the investigation of this case was entrusted to Tanvir Abbas, SI 
(PW-13), who found the accused/appellant guilty, prepared a 
report under Section 173, Cr.P.C. while placing the names of the 
accused in column No.3 of the Challan and sent the same to the 
court of competent jurisdiction. The learned trial court formally 
charge-sheeted the appellant on 04.05.2017, to which he pleaded 
not guilty and claimed trial. In support of his version, the 
complainant produced as many as thirteen (13) witnesses. The 
appellant was also examined in terms of Section 342 Cr.P.C., 
wherein he neither opted to appear as his own witness in terms of 
Section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor produced any defence evidence.  
6. 
 
After recording evidence and evaluating the evidence 
available on record in light of arguments advanced from both 
sides, the learned trial court found the prosecution version proved 
beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt, which resulted in the 
appellant’s conviction as well as awarding of sentence to him in the 
afore-stated terms. 
7. 
 
We have heard the arguments advanced by the learned 
counsel for the parties and have minutely perused the record on 
the file. 
8. 
 
The incident took place on 21.12.2009 at 04:00/05:00 
a.m. in the house of Asjad Mehmood, situated in the area of village 
Khunan, within the area of Police Station, Sadar Kharian, District, 
Gujrat, which is at a distance of seven (7) Miles from the place of 
occurrence. Mst. Maqsood Bibi (PW-1)-the complainant reported 
the incident through her Fard Bayyan (Exh. PA) to Muhammad 
Khan Ranjha, S.I. (PW-9) at 06:00 a.m., who reached the place of 
occurrence on receiving information and referred the Fard Bayyan 

M.R No.100 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.44525-J of 2019

(Exh.PA) through Muhammad Hanif 3432/C (not cited as PW) to the 
police station, based on which, formal F.I.R. (Exh.PC) was chalked 
out on the same day at 6:30 a.m. by Wasif Hussain SI/DO (PW-4). 
Mst. Maqsood Bibi, the complainant (PW-1), deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“---Atif Pw informed police about the 
occurrence telephonically at once. Atif 
Pw is serving in any department in 
Kharian that’s why he has telephone 
number of Police Station---” 
It is notable that immediately after the incident of the murder of 
Babra, it was reported to the police. It is noticed that the 
occurrence took place at 04:00/05:00 a.m. (night), and the distance 
between the police station and the place of occurrence was seven 
(7) Miles, whereas Mst. Maqsood Bibi, the complainant (PW-1), 
deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“I got recorded my statement to police at 
about 5.30 am.” 
Whereas, the police proceedings (Exh. PA/1) written below at the 
Fard Bayyan (Exh. PA) reveal that the same was written at 06:00 
a.m. Sohail Amjad (PW-2), son of the deceased, deposed during 
cross-examination that: - 
“---Atif Pw informed the police about the 
occurrence. Police reached at place of 
occurrence at 6.00 a.m---”  
Thus, it was established from the evidence of Mst. Maqsood Bibi 
(PW-1) and Sohail Amjad (PW-2) that Atif Annayat (PW) informed 
the police about the incident and said witness was given up being 
un-necessary, therefore, an adverse inference is to be drawn 
within the meaning of Article 129 (g) of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 
1984 that had the witness Atif Annayat, been appeared in witness 
box, then his testimony would have been un-favourable to the 
prosecution.

Crl. Appeal No.44525-J of 2019

Mst. Maqsood Bibi, the complainant (PW-1), deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“---I can not tell inter se distance of 
village Khunan and Police Station Saddar 
Kharian---I can not tell the numbers of 
police officials/officers who reached at 
the place of occurrence. I got recorded 
my statement to Moulvi Shareef, police 
officer--- It is correct that Moulvi Shareef 
questioned me about the occurrence and 
I made answers to him and same were 
reduced to writing by him---”  
Mst. Maqsood Bibi, the complainant (PW-1), reaffirms that their 
statements were recorded by “Moulvi Shareef.” But as per record, 
name of the police officer to whom Mst. Maqsood Bibi, the 
complainant (PW-1) got, recorded her statement (Exh.PA/1) 
regarding occurrence, is Muhammad Khan, S.I and not Moulvi 
Shareef. Mst. Maqsood Bibi, the complainant (PW-1), deposed 
during cross-examination that: - 
“---When 
my 
statement 
was 
being 
recorded by Moulvi Shareef, I, Atif and 
Sohail were present---”  
Contrary to the deposition of Mst. Maqsood Bibi, the complainant 
(PW-1), Muhammad Khan Ranjha, S.I. (PW-9), deposed during 
examination-in-chief that: - 
“---Stated that on 21.12.2009 I was posted 
as ASI/IO in Police Station Kharian 
Sadar. On the same day, on receiving the 
information of occurrence, I along with 
other police officials reached place of 
occurrence in village Khunan where 
complainant Maqsood Bibi appeared 
before me and got recorded his statement 
about the occurrence which I reduced 
into writing which was read over to her 
and she admitting it correct thumb 
marked 
the 
same 
as 
a 
token 
of 
correctness---”

It creates doubt, that who prepared the Fard Bayyan (Exh. PA). 
Mst. Maqsood Bibi, the complainant (PW-1), stated during cross-
examination that when police reached the place of occurrence, 
they at once recorded her statement and then made an 
investigation/inquiry. Mst. Maqsood Bibi, the complainant (PW-1), 
deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“---Police 
reached 
the 
place 
of 
occurrence 
recorded 
statements 
and 
conducted other proceedings and after 
5/10 minutes they took the dead body of 
Babra with them on a white colour 
vehicle Dala. I do not know who went 
with dead body of Babra---”  
Sohail Amjad (PW-2), son of the deceased, deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“---Police left the place of occurrence 
after 90/120 minutes---”  
The dead body of Barbra deceased was escorted to the THQ, 
Kharian, for autopsy by Yasir Iqbal 2331-C (PW-5) on 21.12.2009. 
Yasir Iqbal 2331-C (PW-5) deposed during cross-examination 
that:- 
“---I escorted the dead body of Babra 
deceased from her village Khunan. I 
reached there at 6.00 AM. I remained 
there at place of occurrence about 30 
minutes. We came to Tehsil Headquarter 
Hospital, 
Kharian 
on 
vehicle/Dala-
Shahzore. I escorted the dead body along 
with 3/4  female whose name are not 
known to me. We reached at Tehsil 
Headquarter 
Hospital, 
Kharian 
at 
7.00/7.30 AM. I remained in Tehsil 
Headquarter Hospital, Kharian till 2.30 
PM---Dead body was sent to dead house 
at 7.30 AM---It is correct that four females 
who escorted the dead body were neither 
examined by the IO nor their statements 
were recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C-”

Muhammad 
Khan 
Ranjha, 
S.I. 
(PW-9)-investigating 
officer, 
deposed during examination-in-chief that: - 
“---I send the dead body for postmortem 
examination along with police papers to 
Tehsil Headquarter Hospital, Kharian 
under the escort of Yasir Iqbal 2331-C---”  
Muhammad Khan Ranjha, S.I. (PW-9)-investigating officer had not 
stated the names of family members who went with the dead body 
of Babra Bibi-the deceased to identify her dead body. In the 
column of the brief history of inquest report (Exh. PF), the names of 
witnesses accompanying the dead body to identify the dead body 
were also not given. Zafer Iqbal (PW-3) deposed that he and 
Iftikhar Hussain (given up PW) identified the dead body of Babra 
Bibi-the deceased before and after the postmortem examination. 
Zafer Iqbal (PW-3) deposed during examination-in-chief that: - 
“---We reached at Tehsil Headquarter 
Hospital, Kharian for postmortem at 
about 10.00 AM. We remained in Tehsil 
Headquarter 
Hospital, 
Kharian 
till 
2.00/2.30 PM. Dr. started postmortem 
examination at about 2.00/2.30 PM---We 
left our village Chailanwala at about 8.30 
AM boarding on public vehicle/Bus. I do 
not remember how long it take to reach 
Tehsil Headquarter Hospital, Kharian---I 
and Babra Bibi deceased belong to same 
village. We both belong to Gujjar caste.” 
9.  
 
It is strange that at the time and place of occurrence, 
the nephew of Mst. Maqsood Bibi, the complainant (PW-1), namely 
Atif Inayat (given up PW), was present, but he has not 
accompanied the dead body of Babra Bibi-the deceased. In our 
social setup, persons with no blood relation cannot see females 
after death. In the presence of family member Atif Inayat (given up 
PW), Zafer Iqbal (PW-3) was called from Chailanwala, and he 
boarded public transport at about 08:30 a.m and went to Tehsil 
Headquarter Hospital, Kharian at about 10: a.m. The deposition of 
Zafer Iqbal (PW-3) reveals that he (PW-3) belongs to the same 

M.R No.100 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.44525-J of 2019 
 
 
8
village and caste to which Babra Bibi belonged. He (PW-3) has not 
stated his relationship with Babra Bibi. The unexplained 
discrepancy in the timings recorded in the inquest report (Exh. PF) 
must be considered. It is the prosecution’s version that the death 
information was received at 06:00 a.m., but column No. 3 of the 
inquest report revealed that the date and time of receiving 
information of death were 21.12.2009 at 04:00/05:00 a.m. As per 
the prosecution case, fard Bayyan (Exh. PA) was written at 06:00 
a.m., and in column No.4 of the inquest report, names of the 
persons who identified the dead body at the time of the inquest 
mentioned Zafer Iqbal (PW-3) and Iftikhar Hussain (given up PW). 
If it was so, it was required to be explained by Muhammad Khan 
Ranjha, S.I. (PW-9)-investigating officer, by plausible evidence on 
the record as to how the inquest was undertaken at 04:00/05:00 
a.m. in the presence of Zafer Iqbal (PW-3), who was called from 
Chailanwala and proceeded at about 08:30 a.m. and directly went 
to 
THQ 
Hospital. 
Muhammad 
Khan 
Ranjha, 
S.I. 
(PW-9)-
investigating officer deposed that on 21.12.2009 received the 
information of occurrence in village Khunan. After that, he (PW-9), 
along with other police officials, proceeded to the place of 
occurrence. After that, he (PW-9) recorded Fard Bayyan (Exh. PA) 
and after that, prepared an inquest report (Ex. PF) and an injury 
statement (Ex. PG) and entrusted the dead body of Babra Bibi-the 
deceased, to Yasir Iqbal 2331-C (PW-5) for taking to the mortuary 
for postmortem examination. If Muhammad Khan S.I. (PW-9)-
investigating officer, reached the place of occurrence upon 
receiving information, then the complainant had met with her and 
recorded Fard Bayyan (Exh. PA) and he prepared an injury 
statement (Ex. PG). On perusal of the injury statement (Exh. PG), it 
reveals that space was left blank after mentioning "بنام ــــــــــــ" and it 
reveals that till preparation of the injury statement (Ex. PG), Fard 
Bayyan (Exh. PA) was not prepared. We have also perused the 

M.R No.100 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.44525-J of 2019 
 
 
9
Inquest Report (Exh.PF).  Under Column No. 24 of the Inquest 
Report (Exh. PF), a sketch plan of where the dead body is found is 
not given. The investigating officer had not prepared a drawing of 
where the dead body was lying and its condition but left it blank. 
The conduct of the I.O. and his investigation of the case is also not 
above board. The First Information Report was recorded at 06:30 
a.m. vide F.I.R. (Exh. PC). Strangely enough, Muhammad Hanif 
3432/Constable, who delivered the carbon copy of FIR (Exh. PC) 
and original complaint (Exh. PA) to Muhammad Khan Ranjha, S.I. 
(PW-9)-investigating officer at village Noonanwali, was not cited as 
the prosecution witness. Muhammad Khan Ranjha, S.I. (PW-9)-
investigating officer deposed during examination-in-chief that: - 
“---Muhammad Hanif 3432-C met me at 
village Noonanwali and he handed over to 
me the carbon copy of FIR and original 
complaint. I attached the said documents 
with the police file. After the postmortem 
examination Yasir Iqbal 2331-C, Zafar 
Iqbal, and Iftikhar Hussain met me in the 
Police Station Kharian Sadar---” 
It means the prosecution took all this time for due deliberations 
and consultations to find convenient eyewitnesses of the 
occurrence. It has also been noted that the two eye-witnesses are 
near relatives of the deceased, as has been admitted by the 
prosecution witnesses themselves. Mst. Maqsood Bibi, the 
complainant (PW-1), is the mother of the deceased, and Sohail 
Amjad (PW-2) is the son of the deceased. Further, Mst. Maqsood 
Bibi, the complainant (PW-1), belongs to the village of 
Chailianwala. At the same time, Sohail Amjad (PW-2) and Babra 
Bibi (deceased) belong to the village Khunan. Mst. Maqsood Bibi 
(PW-1)-the complainant deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“---I left village Chailianwala before 
Maghrab prayer for village Khunan. I 
reached village Khunan by motorcycle. 
Darkness had been prevailed when I 
reached village Khanan but I can not tell 

M.R No.100 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.44525-J of 2019 
 
 
10
the exact time. When we reached Babra 
was busy in cooking---”  
During cross-examination, Sohail Amjad (PW-2) deposed that her 
maternal grandmother and Atif PW reached their house after the 
evening on the bike. At the time of the murder of his mother, his 
age was 9/10 years. Maqsood Bibi (PW-1)-the complainant 
deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“---Accused Asjid called Babra deceased 
by knocking of door at about 4/5.00 am. It 
is correct that knocking of door is not 
mentioned in my statement Ex.PA. I 
awaked up by knocking of door., I have 
stated the above mentioned fact in Ex.PA. 
Confronted 
with 
Ex.PA 
where 
it 
is 
mentioned that Babra deceased went 
outside and we awaked up---it is correct 
that it is not mentioned in Ex.PA that 
accused Asjid called Babra loudly---” 
Contrary to Maqsood Bibi (PW-1)-the complainant, Sohail Amjad 
(PW-2), son of the deceased, deposed during cross-examination 
that: - 
“---Month of December is usually cold 
and fogy. It was about 4/5.00 am when 
Asjad accused called my mother outside 
the room and I heard the voice of calling. 
I woke up due to voice of Asjad accused. I 
tis correct that I have not stated in my 
statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C that I 
awoke up by the voice of Asjad accused 
rather it is mentioned in same that I 
awoke up when my mother went out from 
room---”  
Maqsood Bibi (PW-1)-the complainant deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“---One electric bulb was lightening in 
verandah where accused Asjad and Babra 
deceased were standing while another 
bulb was lightening where we Pws were 
standing. 
I 
have 
mentioned in 
my 
statement Ex.PA that electric light was 
lightening at relevant time---” 

M.R No.100 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.44525-J of 2019 
 
 
11
Contrary to Maqsood Bibi (PW-1)-the complainant, Sohail Amjad 
(PW-2), son of the deceased, deposed during cross-examination 
that: - 
“---It is correct that lightening of electric 
Bulbs at relevant time is not mentioned in 
my statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C---”  
Looking at these facts, we are of the opinion that the prosecution 
has withheld the true genesis of the occurrence. On perusal of the 
postmortem examination report (Exh. PM) of Babra Bibi-the 
deceased. In column No.4, under the heading 'Abdomen,’ Stomach 
and its contents-semi-digested food. Semi-digested food was 
found, meaning thereby that the deceased had taken a meal 2 or 3 
hours before being murdered. Sohail Amjad (PW-2), son of the 
deceased, deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“---We have dinner at about 8/9.00 pm-”  
Maqsood Bibi (PW-1)-the complainant, Sohail Amjad (PW-2), son of 
the deceased, deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“---On that day we had eaten potato and 
beans in dinner---”  
As per Sohail Amjad (PW-2), they took a meal at 8/9 p.m. 
According to the post-mortem report, semi-digested food was 
found; thus, the time of occurrence becomes doubtful. A perusal of 
F.I.R. (Ex. PC) reveals that the same was lodged at 6:30 a.m. on 
21.12.2009, and Dr. Adeeba conducted postmortem examination at 
02:20 p.m. on the same day; she did not appear as a witness being 
abroad. The postmortem examination report (Exh. PM) was proved 
by Dr. Amjad, who appeared as a secondary witness. The contents 
of the postmortem examination report (Exh. PM) reveal that the 
dead body was received in the dead house on 21.12.2009 at 2:00 
p.m., and complete documents from police were received at 2:20 
p.m. The autopsy was conducted at 2:20 p.m. Autopsy was 
conducted after about seven hours and fifty minutes from the time 
of registration of FIR. The prosecution did not explain the delay in 

M.R No.100 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.44525-J of 2019 
 
 
12
conducting the postmortem examination. The fact, however, 
remains that the post-mortem examination was delayed for seven 
hours and fifty minutes. Considering all these facts, this court has 
no hesitation in concluding that the prosecution has not been able 
to prove on record that the FIR was recorded at the claimed time.  
The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, in the case of “Irshad 
Ahmed  v. The State” (2011 SCMR 1193), held that: - 
“We have further observed that the post-mortem 
examination of the dead body of Shehzad 
Ahmed deceased had been conducted with a 
noticeable delay and such delay is generally 
suggestive of a real possibility that time had 
been consumed by the police in procuring and 
planting eye-witnesses and in cooking up a story 
for the prosecution before preparing police 
papers necessary for getting a post-mortem 
examination of the dead body conducted.” 
Delay in lodging the first information report often results in 
consultation and deliberation, which is a creature of an 
afterthought. The prosecution failed to explain the delay in 
reporting the incident and the delay in conducting a post-mortem 
examination of the dead body of Babra Bibi-the deceased. Hence 
these circumstances raise considerable doubt regarding the 
veracity of the case and suggests delay in reporting the incident in 
lodging the first information report which is fatal to the 
prosecution’s case.   
10.   
Another aspect of the case is a conflict between the 
ocular 
and 
medical 
evidence. 
Maqsood 
Bibi 
(PW-1)-the 
complainant deposed during examination-in-chief that: - 
“---Meanwhile Asjad Mehmood accused 
present in the court made 3 fire shots with 
his rifle which landed on the belly and 
one fire hit on her chest. All fires went 
through and through---” 
Contrary to the above, Maqsood Bibi (PW-1)-the complainant, 
deposed during cross-examination that: - 

M.R No.100 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.44525-J of 2019 
 
 
13
“---We were standing near Babra at 
relevant time that’s we witnessed that fire 
shots were through and through---”  
Sohail Amjad (PW-2) deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“---Three fire shots were made by the 
accused. It is correct that I have not 
mentioned in my statement u/s 161 
Cr.P.C that three fires shots were made 
by Asjad accused. Two fire shots were 
landed on belly and one fire shot was 
landed on the chest of my mother. It is 
correct that I have not mentioned in my 
statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C that how many 
fire shots were landed on belly and how 
many on the chest. My mother fell on 
ground by back after receiving fire shots”  
The postmortem examination report (Exh. PM) reveals that the 
deceased received three firearm injuries. Injury No, 1-a went 
through and through, whereas injuries 2-a and 3-a were from 
downward to upward. In the prosecution’s case, the accused shot a 
burst, and all fire shots landed on the deceased's body; after that, 
Babra Bibi fell. Under the head external examination sub-head 
examination of clothes, the postmortem report (Exh. PM) reveals 
that the deceased’s shirt was torn. The prosecution’s evidence is 
silent on how the deceased’s shirt was torn and who did so. Even 
the lady doctor has not observed corresponding holes on the shirt. 
The distance from which the accused fired upon the deceased 
becomes irrelevant because the investigating officer had not 
mentioned the distance between points A, B, and C in the unscaled 
site plan (Exh. PI). The scaled site plan (Exh. PJ) was prepared on 
25.12.2009, wherein the distance between different points was 
given. Muhammad Khan Ranjha S.I. (PW-9)-investigating officer 
deposed during examination-in-chief that: - 
“---it is correct that in the un-scaled site 
plan of the place of occurrence Ex.PJ, I

The conflict between medical evidence and ocular testimony was 
so severe that it traveled to the roots of the matter and knocked the 
bottom of the prosecution’s case against the accused. There was an 
apparent conflict between the medical evidence and ocular 
testimony of chance, and an interested witness incapable of being 
believed.  
11.   
The motive set up by the prosecution in the Fard 
Bayyan (Exh.PA) and F.I.R. (Exh.PC) is that Babra Bibi-the 
deceased made the call to Mst. Maqsood Bibi (PW-1)-the 
complainant on 20.12.2009 and informed her that there were 
usually domestic quarrels between the deceased and the accused; 
coming to know of the occurrence, she and her bhanja Atif Anayat 
went to the house of Babra Bibi-the deceased situated at Khonan. 
After that, Mst. Maqsood Bibi (PW-1)-the complainant, and Sohail 
Amjad (PW-2), eyewitnesses, have improved their statements 
before the police. The defence has brought on record the 
contradictions in the evidence of Mst. Maqsood Bibi (PW-1)-the 
complainant, and Sohail Amjad (PW-2), eyewitnesses. Mst. 
Maqsood Bibi (PW-1)-the complainant deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“---Motive behind the occurrence was 
that Amjad was sending money to Asjad 
accused, but after his marriage he used 
to live separately with his wife and used 
to send money to Mst. Babra that’s why a 
quarrel existed between Babra, Amjad 
and Asjad accused. It is correct that I 
have not mentioned the sending of money 
to accused Adjad and afterward to Babra 
deceased in my statement Ex.PA. I

Crl. Appeal No.44525-J of 2019 
 
 
15
always remained acquainted with quarrel 
of Amjad, Babra and Asjad accused 
through Amjad or Babra deceased, Babra 
deceased made a telephonic call to me on 
20.12.2009 at about evening time and we 
remained talking for about 5/10 minutes. 
I can not tell the cell number from which 
I received telephonic call of Babra 
deceased even I can not tell my own 
number. Babra informed me that we have 
a quarrel; with Asjad accused and yuou 
people should come to settle the dispute. 
It is correct that I have not stated in Ex.PA 
that you people should come to settle the 
dispute. When I was talking to Babra on 
20.12.2009 on a telephonic call, PW-Atif 
was present there and same fact is not 
mentioned in Ex.PA---I have not got 
recorded in Ex.PA the time when Babra 
made a telephonic call to me---” 
Sohail Amjad (PW-2) deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“---Quarrel 
took 
place 
between 
my 
mother and Asjad accused regarding 
money in my presence. On the day of 
occurrence I got recorded my statement 
u/s 161 Cr.P.C before police. I do not 
remember whether I got recorded in my 
statement  u/s 161 Cr.P.C that a quarrel 
took place between my father and Asjad 
accused. I do not remember when my 
father went back to France prior to this 
occurrence. 
I 
got 
recorded 
in 
my 
statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C that my mother 
made a telephonic call to my maternal 
grandmother 
regarding 
the 
quarrel 
between her and Asjad accused. Said 
telephonically call was made in my 
presence before Asar prayer (before 
Degar-Waila) and I have not stated this 
fact in my statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C. The 
telephonic call between my mother and 
maternal grandmother lasted for 10/15 
minutes. My mother asked my maternal 
grandmother 
that 
Asjad 
accused 
is 
quarreling with us and you people should 
come to settle the dispute an d same fact 
is not mentioned in my statement u/s 161 

M.R No.100 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.44525-J of 2019 
 
 
16
Cr.P.C. I do not remember the mobile 
numbers of my mother and my maternal 
grandmother. My maternal grandmother 
and Atif Pw reached our houses after 
evening on bike. During the days of 
occurrence I was student of 4th class but I 
do not remember the name of my school. 
It is correcr5 that I have not mentioned in 
my statement u/s 161 Cr.P./C that my 
mother made a telephonic call to my 
grandmother in my presence---” 
Thus, the defence has brought the material contradiction in the 
evidence of Mst. Maqsood Bibi (PW-1)-the complainant, and Sohail 
Amjad (PW-2), eyewitnesses, on record. In the circumstances, we 
cannot avoid the conclusion that the motive, as alleged, was an 
afterthought and does not inspire confidence, and therefore the 
same deserves to be discarded. 
12.   
The recovery of the rifle (P-5) allegedly affected by the 
appellant on 24-03-2017 is of no consequence to the prosecution 
case when medical evidence is at variance with the ocular account.  
The report of Forensic Science Laboratory, Punjab, Lahore (Exh. 
PQ) is only to the effect that the weapon allegedly recovered from 
the accused/appellant was in mechanical operating condition. So, 
the recovery of the weapon from the accused is of no 
consequence. 
13.   
The murder was committed in the appellant’s house, 
and the appellant was not there after the occurrence. As far as the 
absconding of the appellant is concerned, the evidence taken 
against the appellant is that he had absconded after the incident. 
Muhammad Khan Ranjha S.I. (PW-9)-investigating officer deposed 
during examination-in-chief that: - 
“---I searched accused present in the 
court for many times but in vain. On 
07.01.2010 I made the application Ex.PK 
for non-bailable warrants of arrest of 
accused Asjad and non-bailable warrants 
of arrest was handed over to Muhammad 

M.R No.100 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.44525-J of 2019 
 
 
17
Arshad 343-C for execution. Non-bailable 
warrants of arrest of accused could not be 
executed. After recording the statement 
of Muhammad Arshad 343-C before 
learned Area Magistrate I made the 
application Ex.PL for proclamation of the 
accused. Proclamation was handed over 
to 
Muhammad 
Arshad 
343-C 
for 
execution. On 27.01.2010 I recorded the 
statement of Muhammad Arshad 343-C 
for execution regarding the execution of 
non-bailable 
warrants 
of 
arrest 
and 
proclamation of accused present in the 
court. On 29.01.2010 I got prepared the 
incomplete report u/s 173/512 Cr.P.C 
through SHO and declared the accused 
present in the court as P.O---” 
Given the deposition of Muhammad Khan Ranjha S.I. (PW-9)-
investigating officer, it reveals nothing to show that the 
proceedings under Sections 87 and 88 of Cr.P.C took place against 
the appellant as prescribed in the law. The appellant was indeed 
absconding, but in the present case, the substantive piece of 
evidence in the shape of an ocular account has been disbelieved; 
therefore, no conviction can be based on absconsion alone.  
Reliance is placed on the case reported as “Rohtas Khan v. The 
State” (2010 SCMR 566). We believe the case against the appellant 
has not been made out. The appeal of the appellant must, 
therefore, be allowed.  
14.   
From the above-detailed discussion, we are convinced 
that the prosecution has failed to establish its case.  The truth was 
seen buried under the debris, and a different story was structured 
perhaps to lug the appellant into trial under the severe offense.  It 
is often said “that Fouler the crime higher the degree of proof” we 
have gone through the process of keen examination of the entire 
material and found compelling reasons, as stated above, to 
disagree with the conclusion reached/recorded by the learned 
Additional Sessions Judge and also found that the prosecution has 

M.R No.100 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.44525-J of 2019 
 
 
18
miserably failed to prove the guilt of the accused-appellant 
beyond a reasonable doubt. As per the dictates of law benefit of 
every doubt is to be extended in favour of the accused. 
15.   
We, therefore, accept in toto Criminal Appeal No. 
44525-J of 2019 filed by Asjad Mehmood, son of Muhammad Khan, 
as a result of which conviction and sentence recorded by the 
learned trial Court vide judgment dated 11.04.2019 is set-aside. 
The appellant is acquitted of the charge in the case of F.I.R. No.563 
of 2009, dated 21.12.2009, an offence under Section 302 PPC, 
registered at Police Station Saddar Kharian, District Gujrat, and he 
(Asjad Mehmood, son of Muhammad Khan) be released forthwith, 
if not required in any other case. 
16.   
Murder Reference No.100 of 2019 forwarded by the 
learned trial court for confirmation of the sentence of death 
inflicted upon the convict fails, which is answered in Negative.
