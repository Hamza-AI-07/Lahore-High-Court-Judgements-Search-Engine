Through 
instant 
petition, 
Muhammad 
Ashfaq 
(petitioner/accused) has sought post-arrest bail in case arising out 
of F.I.R. No.602/2023 dated: 30.07.2023 registered under 
Sections: 302, 109, 148, 149 PPC (during investigation offence 
under Section: 449 PPC was added subsequently) at Police 
Station: Saddar Gojra, District: Toba Tek Singh.  
2. 
After hearing learned counsel for the parties, learned 
Deputy Prosecutor General and going through the available record 
with their able assistance, it has been noticed that briefly as per 
Crime 
Report 
(FIR) 
got 
recorded 
by 
Jabbar 
Ahmad 
(complainant), on 30.07.2023 at about 1:15 p.m., Muhammad 
Abbas, Muhammad Nawaz and Muhammad Ashfaq (present 
petitioner) while armed came, entered into the house, Muhammad 
Ashfaq (present petitioner) locked the room where complainant 
and other witnesses were present, Muhammad Nawaz and 
Muhammad Ashfaq (present petitioner) took Naveed Akhtar 
(brother of the complainant) into clasp ( برادرم  کو  جپھا  مارا), 
Muhammad Nawaz raised lalkara upon which Muhammad Abbas 
fired shots at both legs of Naveed Akhtar, who while becoming 
injured fell down, Muhammad Ashfaq (present petitioner) raised 
lalkara upon which Muhammad Abbas fired shots at both arms of 
Naveed Akhtar, Muhammad Nawaz further asked Muhammad 
Abbas for finishing him upon which Muhammad Abbas fired 
successive shots, one fire shot went through and through from 
chest, accused persons fled away while uttering abuses, raising 

Crl. Misc. No.80313-B/2023

lalkara and brandishing weapons, Naveed Akhtar succumbed to 
the injuries on the way to hospital, this occurrence took place on 
the abetment and consultation of Abdul Razzaq and Muhammad 
Zubair. Admittedly petitioner neither caused any injury to Naveed 
Akhtar (now deceased of the case) nor to anybody else in this 
case, rather allegation of closing door of the room where 
complainant and other witnesses were present, raising lalkara as 
well as taking deceased into clasp has been levelled against him. 
So far as lalkara is concerned, either it was proverbial or 
commanding would be seen during trial. As far as allegation of 
taking Naveed Akhtar (now deceased of the case) into clasp ( جپھا) 
by the present petitioner is concerned, suffice it to say that when it 
is own case of prosecution that both arms as well as legs and chest 
were hit with shots fired by firearm weapon then taking into clasp 
the victim while exposing himself to the risk of being hit by doing 
so itself requires further probe/inquiry and in this regard guidance 
has been sought from the case of “Ghulam Hyder versus The 
State” (2021 SCMR 1802) whereas case of “Jamil Khan versus 
The State and another” (2005 PCr.LJ 2003) can also be 
advantageously referred on the subject. On Court’s query, learned 
Deputy Prosecutor General under instructions of police official 
(present before the Court) and after himself going through 
available record submits that any offence regarding confinement 
of complainant or other witnesses into the room has not been 
added in this case till now and while referring to case diary No.17 
dated 15.09.2023 apprises that after thorough investigation it has 
been concluded by the investigating agency that petitioner was not 
equipped with any weapon at the time of occurrence rather he 
came, entered into the place of occurrence empty handed and was 
present at the place of occurrence when Muhammad Abbas (co-
accused) committed the occurrence while making firing from his 
pistol; further apprises that Muhammad Nawaz against whom 
similar role of raising lalkara as well as clasping Naveed Akhtar 
(now deceased of the case) was alleged has been declared 
innocent during investigation of the case and similar is the 

Crl. Misc. No.80313-B/2023 
3 
 
position of accused of abetment namely Abdul Razzaq and Zubair 
who have also been found innocent during investigation of the 
case; also adds that nothing has been recovered from the present 
petitioner. 
When all the aforementioned factors are taken into 
consideration in totality then case of the prosecution against the 
petitioner, at present, requires further probe/inquiry and falls 
within the purview of sub-Section (2) of Section: 497 Cr.P.C. 
Petitioner was arrested in the case on 10.09.2023 and sent to jail 
on 18.09.2023 where he is confined till now. Mere detention of 
the petitioner in the lockup would not serve any useful purpose 
to the case of prosecution. Bail cannot be withheld as advance 
punishment. 
By now it is also well settled that it is better to err in 
granting bail than to err in refusal because ultimate conviction 
and sentence can repair the wrong resulted by a mistaken relief 
of bail; in this regard, case of “CHAIRMAN, NATIONAL 
ACCOUNTABILITY BUREAU through P.G., NAB versus 
NISAR AHMED PATHAN and others” (PLD 2022 Supreme 
Court 475) can be advantageously referred and its relevant 
portion from Page No(s).480-481 is reproduced: - 
“To err in granting bail is better than to err in 
declining; for the ultimate conviction and sentence 
of a guilty person can repair the wrong caused by a 
mistaken relief of bail, but no satisfactory 
reparation can be offered to an innocent person on 
his acquittal for his unjustified imprisonment during 
the trial.” 
 
3.   
In view of what has been discussed above, instant 
petition filed by Muhammad Ashfaq (petitioner) for grant of 
post arrest bail is allowed and he is admitted to bail in the case 
subject to his furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.300,000/- 
(Rupees three hundred thousand only) with two sureties each in 
the like amount to the satisfaction of trial Court. 
4. 
It goes without saying that observations mentioned above 
are just tentative in nature, strictly confined to the disposal of 
instant bail petition and will have no bearing upon trial of the 

Crl. Misc. No.80313-B/2023 
4 
 
case, which will be concluded by the trial court expeditiously. 
Needless to add that if petitioner or anybody else acting on his 
behalf will create any hurdle in the way of conclusion of trial, 
then complainant as well as the State would be at liberty to 
move for recalling of this order.
