JUDGMENT 
 
Date of hearing 16.5.2024 
 
Petitioners by 
Mr. Fida Hussain Rana, Advocate. 
Respondents by 
 
Mr. Muhammad Ali Farooq, Advocate. 
 
 
  Abid Aziz Sheikh, J.-. Through this constitutional 
petition, the petitioners have challenged the office order 
dated 31.8.2023, whereby the Governing Body of Punjab 
Employees Social Security Institution (PESSI) amended 
the Punjab Employees Social Security Institution (Revised 
Service) Regulations, 2008 (Regulations) and also 
seeking direction against respondents to comply with the 
order dated 09.1.2023 passed by Chairman, Governing 
Body PEESI (Chairman) and appointed the petitioners 

2 
W.P.No.60763/2023 
against the post of Assistant against 25% graduate quota 
under Regulations. 
2. 
Relevant facts are that petitioners are permanent 
employees of PESSI and being graduate were entitled to 
be appointed for the post of Assistant against 25% quota 
reserved for PESSI graduate employees, prior to 
amendment in Regulations, however, through impugned 
office order dated 31.8.2023, the Governing Body of 
PEESI amended the regulations, hence this constitutional 
petition has been filed.  
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that 
petitioners had already undergone the process of 
appointment as Assistant against 25% quota reserved for 
graduate employees of PEESI in year 2018, however, 
before passing of their formal orders of appointment, 
Regulations have been amended through impugned order. 
Submits that petitioners are seeking enforcement of 
Regulations in compliance of order dated 09.1.2023 
passed by Chairman. Further submits that said amendment 
in Regulations is not only beyond the scope of Punjab 
Employees Social Security Ordinance, 1965 (Ordinance),   
but also offends the accrued vested rights in favour of the 

3 
W.P.No.60763/2023 
petitioners. Further submits that Regulations being duly 
notified, this constitutional petition is maintainable for its 
enforcement. Placed reliance on Nadeem Zuberi vs. Civil 
Aviation Authority through Director General (2023 PLC 
(C.S.) 1133).  
4. 
Learned for the respondents on the other hand 
beside contesting this petition on merits, submits that 
petitioners are seeking enforcement of Regulations, which 
are non-statutory, therefore this constitutional petition is 
not maintainable. Adds that Governing Body of PEESI has 
lawfully amended the Regulations before any vested right 
accrued in favour of the petitioners.  
 
5. 
Arguments heard. In crux, the petitioners on one 
hand are seeking the enforcement of Regulations for their 
appointment against the post of Assistant under 25% 
graduate quota of PESSI employees before the amendment 
of the Regulations on 31.8.2023 and on the other hand, 
they have also challenged the office order dated 31.8.2023, 
whereby the Regulations have been amended by the 
Governing Body of PEESI. So far as the plea for 
enforcement of Regulations for the appointment of 

4 
W.P.No.60763/2023 
petitioners against the post of Assistant is concerned, the 
same can only be enforced by this Court, if the said 
Regulations are found to be statutory and have the force of 
law. Therefore, before touching the merits of the case, I 
would like to decide the threshold question of 
maintainability of this petition, to that extent. 
 
6. 
The PESSI has been established under the 
Ordinance. Under section 79 of the Ordinance, the 
Provincial Government may by notification in the official 
gazette make Rules to carry out the purpose of the 
Ordinance, whereas under section 80 of the Ordinance, the 
Governing Body may by notification in the official gazette 
make Regulations not in consistent with the provision of 
the Ordinance or the Rules. Under sub-section 2(viii)(x) of 
section 80 of the Ordinance, the Regulations may also 
provide for the employment of the officers and staff for 
administration of the affairs of the institution as well as 
power of the Commissioner with regard to the 
appointment, transfer, promotion, dismissal and other 
matter effecting the staff of the institution.  

5 
W.P.No.60763/2023 
 
7. 
For ready reference, section 79(1) and 80(1) of the 
Ordinance are reproduced hereunder:- 
 
“79. Power to make rules.(1) Government may, 
subject to the condition of previous publication, by 
Notification, make rules to carrying out the 
purposes of the Ordinance”. 
 
80. Power to make regulations.(1) The Governing 
Body may, subject to the condition of previous 
publication, by Notification, make regulations not 
inconsistent with the provisions of this Ordinance or 
the rules”. 
 
From the plain reading of section 79 and 80 of the 
Ordinance ibid, it is evident that Federal Government may 
make rules for carrying out the purpose of the Ordinance, 
whereas Governing Body may make regulations for 
carrying out functions of the Ordinance including the 
appointments of officers and staff of PESSI. The 
Governing Body is defined under section 2(13) of the 
Ordinance meaning Governing Body of the institution, 
whereas under section 5 of the Ordinance, Governing 
Body will consists of members to be appointed by 
Government by notification. No doubt, the Governing 
Body members are appointed by Government but they are 
not the Government. It is admitted position between the 
parties that the Regulations in question are framed under 
section 80 of the Ordinance by the Governing Body and 

6 
W.P.No.60763/2023 
not by the Provincial Government or with approval of the 
Provincial Government and therefore, same does not have 
the status of statutory Regulations. The position would 
have been different if the terms and conditions sought to 
be implemented through this petition, were framed by the 
Provincial Government by way of rules under section 79 
of the Ordinance instead of Regulations by Governing 
Body under section 80 of the Ordinance.  
 
8. 
The similar regulations framed by the Authority 
under section 45 of the National Data and Registration 
Authority Ordinance, 2000 (Ordinance of 2000) were 
declared to be non-statutory by Supreme Court for the 
reason that same were not framed by the Federal 
Government. This Court in Amir Shahzad and 3 others vs. 
Federation of Pakistan and 3 others (2024 PLC (C.S.) 33) 
followed the said judgment of Supreme Court and held 
that constitutional petition in such situation is not 
maintainable. The relevant part of the judgment is 
reproduced as under:- 
 
“The question whether Regulations of NADRA are 
statutory or not came up before Hon’ble Supreme 
Court 
of 
Pakistan 
in 
Maj. 
(Retd.) 
Syed 
MUHAMMAD 
TANVEER 
ABBAS 
versus 

7 
W.P.No.60763/2023 
FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through Secretary 
Ministry of Interior and anothers (2019 SCMR 984). 
In said case, constitutional petitions were filed 
before learned Sindh High Court by various 
employees of NADRA against their orders of 
termination. The Division Bench of learned Sindh 
High Court dismissed the Constitutional Petitions 
on the ground that Regulations are framed by the 
Authority under Section 45 of the Ordinance, hence, 
they are non-statutory. The said judgment was 
challenged before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan, where the appeals were dismissed and the 
August Supreme Court of Pakistan held that 
Regulations of NADRA are non-statutory in nature. 
Relevant observations of the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan is reproduced hereunder:- “When 
the DHA case is compared with the appellants' case, 
there are certain obvious similarities, the first and 
most important being of course that both involved 
situations of termination from service. Apart from 
that, in our view, as held by this Court in relation to 
DHA, there can hardly be any doubt that NADRA is 
also a "person" within the meaning of Article 
199(1)(a)(ii) read with clause (5) thereof. Equally, it 
is also clear that the 2002 Regulations, like the 
DHA service rules of 2008, were non-statutory in 
nature. It also cannot be in doubt that the 
termination clauses involved in the present appeals 
are in all material respects the same as Rule 8(b)(1) 
of the DHA service rules. This is apparent on a bare 
reading of the said provisions. The crucial question 
therefore is whether the termination clauses 
involved here can be treated in the same manner as 
Rule 8(b)(1), and the same or similar relief 
accorded the present appellants?” (Emphasis 
supplied) The same view was also expressed by 
honourable Supreme Court in “Chairman NADRA, 
Islamabad through Chairman, Islamabad and 
another Vs. Muhammad Ali Shah and others” (2017 
SCMR 1979), “MUHAMMAD ZAMAN and 14 
others versus GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN 
through Secretary, Finance Division, (Regulation 
Wing), Islamabad and others” (2017 SCMR 571), 
“P.T.C.L. and others versus MASOOD AHMAD 

8 
W.P.No.60763/2023 
BHATTI and others” (2016 SCMR 1362), ZARAI 
TARAQIATI BANK LIMITED and others versus 
SAID REHMAN and others” (2013 SCMR 642) and 
“PAKISTAN DEFENCE OFFICERS’ HOUSING 
AUTHORITY and others versus Lt. Col. Syed 
JAWAID AHMAD” (2013 SCMR 1707)”. 
 
The case law relied upon by learned counsel for the 
petitioners is distinguishable and not applicable to the 
facts and circumstances of this case. 
 
9. 
Now coming to the next question i.e. that whether 
regulations could be amended by the Governing Body and 
office order dated 31.8.2023 could be issued, suffice it to 
note that under section 80(2)(viii) and (x) of the 
Ordinance, the Governing Body has ample power to make 
regulations for the employment of the officer and staff and 
can also frame regulations for their transfer, promotion, 
dismissal and other matters. The said power to frame 
regulations includes the power to amend the regulations. 
Therefore, it cannot be said that the amendment in 
Regulations is without jurisdiction. Further as petitioners 
were never appointed as Assistant under the un-amended 
Regulations, hence no vested right accrued in favour of the 
petitioners to challenge the amendment in the regulations 
on this score.

W.P.No.60763/2023 
 
10. 
In view of above discussion, this petition being not 
maintainable and also meritless is dismissed.
