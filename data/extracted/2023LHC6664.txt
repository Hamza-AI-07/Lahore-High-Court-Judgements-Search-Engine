This petition for special leave to appeal against acquittal of 
Abida Shahid and Muhammad Sajjad (respondents No.2 & 3) in a 
private complaint under section 500 read with sections 
193/195/196/211/34 PPC has been filed for setting aside the 
impugned order dated 15.12.2022 of the learned Additional 
Sessions Judge Haroon Abad, District Bahawalnagar passed under 
section 265-K of Cr.P.C.  
2.    Abdul Razaq, husband of Sumaira Rasheed petitioner 
purchased two plots measuring 15 Marla in Evergreen Housing 
Colony, Haroon Abad through registered sale deed No.3091 on 
27.08.2021; when suspected that said plot was sold to more than 
one person by Shahid Iqbal, owner of the colony, he took the 
dispute to civil Court and before ex-officio Justice of the Peace, 
though succeeded to secure status quo yet in the meantime on 
registration of FIR bearing No. 611/21 dated 24.09.2021 under 
sections 384/379/448/511/148/ 149 PPC at police station City 
Haroon Abad, he and one Javid Iqbal were arrested and respondents 
while taking benefit of his absence committed theft in the house of 
petitioner and she also got lodged an FIR bearing No.727 of 2021; 
due to that reason she along with others were also involved in the 
case FIR No. 611/2021 supra through supplementary statement. 
Matter was investigated, interim report under section 173 Cr.P.C. 
was sent to the Court; however, by change of investigation, case 
was recommended for cancellation which was agreed upon by the 
concerned Magistrate on 13.01.2022, prompted the petitioner to file 

P.S.L.A. No.07/2023 2 
 
complaint under sections 500 etc. of PPC with the claim that by the 
act of Shahid Iqbal, owner of colony including the respondents, she 
and her family faced humiliation and were lowered down in the 
estimation of others because of false accusation levelled in FIR.  
3. 
After recording cursory evidence, except Shahid Iqbal, rest 
of the respondents were summoned in the private complaint to face 
the trial but they secured acquittal under section 265-K of Cr.P.C. 
through impugned order. Hence, this P.S.L.A. 
 
4.     Learned counsel for the petitioner states that learned lower 
Court has not appreciated the law in its true prospective because as 
per section 193 PPC any statement made during the investigation 
also amounts to giving or fabricating false evidence and similar is 
the mandate of section 211 of PPC; therefore, if the Court was not 
ready to proceed under section 500 PPC by taking shelter of 
exceptions under section 499 PPC, then sections 193/195/196 & 
211 PPC were open to be proceeded as per procedure explained in 
section 476 of Cr.P.C. 
5.   On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent had 
defended the judgment; however, while responding to the query of 
this Court that can the Court of Session take direct cognizance of 
complaint filed under section 500 of PPC, and whether along with 
section 500, offences under sections 193/195/196 & 211 PPC can 
also be tried, the learned Prosecutor states that as per section 502-
A PPC, inserted in year 2004, a special jurisdiction now vests in the 
Court of Session to entertain the complaint directly and there is no 
bar to try other offences along with offence under section 500 PPC.  
6.     Heard. Record perused. 
 
7.    Impugned order dated 15.12.2022 was more or less based on 
following legal premise; 
“Statement made to police had not passed the test of judicial 
scrutiny and as per law, makers are not under obligation to state 
the truth in such statements; so much so information to law 
enforcement agency for action under the law is one of the 
exceptions of section 499 PPC, therefore, excludes the penal 
consequences under section 500 PPC; it was not a case of 
defamation but could be of malicious prosecution and that stage 

P.S.L.A. No.07/2023 3 
 
too arrives only when such statements are repeated before the 
Court of Justice.”   
8.     Though the case before lower Court was of defamation, yet 
base of allegations was perjury, therefore, it is essential to 
understand the concept of perjury and its difference with act of 
lying which is used for deception. Research shows many 
motivators or incentives for an individual to tell a lie. Paul Ekman 
(1985) theorized there are eight motives for an individual to lie: be 
polite, avoid punishment, gain a reward, protect someone, protect 
oneself, maintain privacy, or just because he or she can. Lies told 
to make an individual feel better or to be polite were often referred 
to as white lies. Ekman argued that these types of lies were not 
necessarily lying because the individual was not attempting to be 
deceitful. On occasion, lies were necessary to protect oneself or 
another, avoid embarrassment, or to maintain privacy. These lies 
could include pure lies, such as a child lying to a stranger or 
hospital staff refusing to answer questions about a patient. 1 
          Whereas ‘Perjury’ is a criminal charge. It is the act of lying 
or making verifiably false statements on a material matter under 
oath or affirmation in a court of law or in any sworn statements in 
writing (Black, 1990). A violation of specific criminal statutes; it is 
not sufficient for a statement to be false to meet the threshold of 
perjury; it must be an intentionally false statement regarding a 
material fact, – a fact relevant to the case at hand. Consequently, 
not all lies under oath are considered perjury. 2 
          At common law, perjury was considered one of the most 
odious of offenses. According to William Hawkins, perjury is 
mother of all Crimes whatsoever the most ‘Infamous and 
Detestable’. Under the Code of Hammurabi, the Roman law, and 
the medieval law of France, the punishment for bearing false

witness was death; in the colony of New York, punishment included 
branding the letter ‘P’ on the offender's forehead. In recent studies 
of public attitudes toward crime, perjury continues to be viewed as 
a very serious offense. 3 
9. 
Mode of trial in this case is the main question; Section 500 
of PPC is triable by Court of Session on complaint filed by the 
aggrieved 
person 
whereas 
offences 
under 
sections 
193/195/196/211 PPC are tried differently under section 476 of 
Cr.P.C. only on the complaint of concerned Court or the public 
servant, therefore, joining of two different modes of trial in one 
complaint is a serious issue. Though section 502-A PPC authorizes 
Court of Session to try the offence under section 500 of PPC but 
as per section 193 of Cr.P.C. Court of Session cannot take direct 
cognizance of an offence unless the case is sent to it by the learned 
Magistrate; in support whereof, cases reported as “MUHAMMAD 
ILTAF KHAN Versus BASHEER and others” (2022 SCMR 356) 
& “BASHEER and 3 others Versus MUHAMMAD ILTAF KHAN  
and another” (2016 P Cr. L J 1469)  are referred; therefore, direct  
cognizance itself was a ground for dismissal of complaint or 
acquittal of accused as the case may be.  Another question needs 
clarification that in the second schedule of Cr.P.C., section 500 of 
PPC was shown as triable by Court of Session and not only this 
section but many offences in the second schedule of Cr.P.C. are 
mentioned as triable by Court of Session, and as per mandate of 
law if such offences are not punishable with death, shall be tried 
by the Magistrate Section-30. With this scope, offence under 
section 500 of PPC then must have been tried by Magistrate section 
30 but in my view when the legislature has specifically inserted 
section 502-A in PPC vesting special jurisdiction in Court of 
Session, offence under section 500 of PPC shall be tried by Court 
of Session and not by Magistrate Section-30.

P.S.L.A. No.07/2023 5 
 
10.      Before it is determined that what could be the mode of trial 
for offences under section 193/195/196/211 PPC, and any false 
statement made to police if not taken to the stage of its replication 
before the Court of Justice, could it still be made basis for offences 
under sections 193/195/196/211 PPC or for section 500 of PPC, it 
is essential to see the meaning of ‘giving false evidence and 
“fabricating false evidence”. section 191 PPC states that;  
“Whoever being legally bound by an oath or by an express provision 
of law to state the truth, or being bound by law to make a declaration 
upon any subject, makes any statement which is false, and which he 
either knows or believes to be false or does not believe to be true, is 
said to give false evidence.” 
This section talks about making of false statement in following 
three situations when; 
(1) 
legally bound by oath to state truth or 
(2) 
legally bound by express provision of law to state truth; 
(3) 
makes declaration upon any subject  
First situation means false statement made on oath before the Court 
of Justice because witness swear to God or make affirmation under 
Oath Act, 1873 to state the truth.  
2nd situation could be like statement made during investigation or 
inquiry before any public authority. Though witnesses are not 
bound to state truth when making statements under section 161 
Cr.P.C. but one of the provisions like section 175 Cr.P.C. could be 
taken as example; according to which when a police-officer is 
conducting investigation under Section 174-A Cr.P.C. the 
witnesses so summoned are bound to answer truly all questions. 
Similarly, as per section 543 of Cr.P.C, interpreter is to be bound to 
interpret statement truthfully; likewise, in proceedings for tender of 
pardon, accused/approve is required to make a truthful disclosure.  
3rd situation of making declaration on any subject, of course deals 
with executing false affidavits or making false declaration like one 
mentioned in sections 199 & 200 of PPC.      
Section 192 PPC explains the situations of ‘fabricating false 
evidence’ as under;  
“Whoever causes any circumstance to exist or makes any false entry 
in any book or record, or makes any document containing a false 

P.S.L.A. No.07/2023 6 
 
statement, intending that such circumstance, false entry or false 
statement may appear in evidence in a judicial proceeding, or in a 
proceeding taken by law before a public servant as such, or before 
an arbitrator, and that such circumstance, false entry or false 
statement, so appearing in evidence, may cause any person who in 
such proceeding is to form an opinion upon the evidence, to entertain 
an erroneous opinion touching any point material to the result of 
such proceeding, is said to fabricate false evidence. 
                                                                         (Emphasis supplied) 
Requirement of this section shall be met only if there is an intention 
to create circumstance, false entry or document with the expectation 
of its being used as evidence in a judicial proceeding, or in any other  
proceeding by law before any public servant or an arbitrator, and 
such circumstance, false entry or document facilitated to render an 
erroneous opinion for result of that proceedings.  
11.    The punishment for giving false evidence or fabricating false 
evidence has been divided into two situations; first when it is given 
in any stage of judicial proceedings and second in any other case. 
Section 193 PPC is reproduced as under;  
193. Punishment for false evidence; Whoever intentionally gives 
false evidence in any stage of a judicial proceeding, or fabricates 
false evidence for the purpose of being used in any stage of a judicial 
proceeding, shall be punished with imprisonment of either 
description for a term, which may extend to seven years, and shall 
also be liable to fine; and whoever, intentionally gives or fabricates 
false evidence in any other case, shall, be punished with 
imprisonment of either description" for a term which may extend to 
three years, and shall also be liable to fine.” 
Explanation-1: A trial before a Court-martial is a judicial 
proceeding. 
Explanation 2: An investigation directed by law preliminary to a 
proceeding before a Court of Justice, is a stage of a judicial 
proceeding, though that investigation may not take place before a 
Court of Justice. 
Explanation 3: An investigation directed by a Court of Justice 
according to law, and conducted under the authority of a Court of 
Justice, is a stage of a judicial proceeding/though that investigation 
may not take place before a Court of Justice. 
 
First, it is essential to see what is judicial proceedings. It has been 
defined in section 4(m) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 as 
under; 
"Judicial proceeding" includes any proceeding in the course of which 
evidence is or may be legally taken on oath.”   
If by law and at the discretion of the Court evidence is taken on oath 
it becomes a stage of judicial proceedings. Section 193 PPC as per 

P.S.L.A. No.07/2023 7 
 
explanations 2 & 3 above creates a room for judicial proceedings 
even during investigation being conducted under the law or on the 
direction of a Court of Justice, but obviously only those false 
statements during investigation would be considered as giving false 
evidence, which are intentionally made and the maker by law is 
bound to state the truth on the subject, or on the same legal premise 
submit any signed statement, affidavits or declarations. In present 
case FIR or statements made under section 161 Cr.P.C. would not 
be considered as made during judicial proceedings. Case reported 
as “ABDUL KHANAN AND OTHERS versus THE STATE AND 2 
OTHERS” (PLD 1986 Peshawar 39) is referred in this respect; 
however, they can be used for alleging perjury in other cases as 
mentioned in second part of section 193 PPC, but of course only 
when the matter is finally terminated. In this case, FIR was 
cancelled but private complaint was filed on the same subject, 
though was later dismissed; however, matter did not end here 
because this Court in Crl. Misc. No. 61-Q/2023 has remanded the 
case to the Court for trial in accordance with law.  
12. 
Matter reported through FIR No.611/2021 while passing 
through the stage of investigation has not been finalized till today, 
therefore, as to whether statements made during investigation at this 
premature stage can be used for an offence of defamation; it has 
been observed that Section 499 PPC though authorizes a person to 
bring a complaint against a person who entirely makes defamatory 
statement to harm his reputation but when such statement is made 
to a police authority, it certainly falls within the exception of section 
499 PPC, therefore, cannot be made basis of defamation. Reliance 
is placed on case reported as “AYESHA BIBI Versus ADDITIONAL 
DISTRICT JUDGE, LAHORE and others” (2018 SCMR 791) and 
such statement at the most could be used to counter malicious 
prosecution if they are tested through judicial scrutiny.  
13.      Now addressing to the question of petitioner’s counsel that 
barring trial under section 500 PPC, trial Court can proceed to take 
cognizance of offences under section 193/195/196/211 PPC. As per 
section 195 of Cr.P.C. if such offences have been committed in, or 

P.S.L.A. No.07/2023 8 
 
in relation to, any proceeding in any Court, cognizance can only be 
taken on the complaint in writing of such Court or of some other 
Court to which such Court is subordinate. So far statements have 
not been formalized as part of judicial proceedings in the Court, 
therefore, Court had no authority to take cognizance of the matter. 
Even applicability of sections 195/196 of PPC is under question 
because statements as an evidence have not been used for procuring 
conviction nor corruptly used as evidence. Case reported as 
“SALAH UDDIN Versus The STATE and 3 others” (PLD 2022 Sindh 
354) is referred in this respect. 
14.   I understand perjury is a vice which stigmatizes the judicial 
system and responsible for failure of justice mission of a country. 
Its impact on the victims of crime or the innocent accused persons 
psychologically or socially is immeasurable and loss is usually 
irreparable, therefore, it must be eradicated with sound measures 
within the parameters of law. It has been learnt that truthful 
witnesses hardly have their say in the system as clutched in the 
hands of powerful persons, who procure stock witnesses to lead the 
fate of case and Courts are to search out the truth from half-truth, 
based on crippled evidence. A study is necessary and required to 
understand how the cases are structured with the help of police by 
the powerful elites and are designed to set the list of witnesses of 
their choice to continue with the prosecution or withdraw at any 
time to leave astray the Court to reach out the justice.    
15.   For what has been discussed above, the learned trial court, 
taking stock of all above factors has rightly passed the impugned 
order which appears to be fully justified in the facts and 
circumstances of the instant case. The instant P.S.L.A is, therefore, 
dismissed in limine and leave to appeal is declined.
