3. 
 Precisely, the facts of the prosecution case as bought on record 
through the statements of various prosecution witnesses are that on 
15.08.2019, Nasir Iqbal (PW-3), the complainant of the case, received 
information that his brother namely Naveed Iqbal (deceased) had died and 
after receiving the said information, Nasir Iqbal (PW-3) proceeded to the 
house of his brother where he found the dead body of the deceased present 
in the courtyard of the said house. Nasir Iqbal (PW-3) thereafter submitted 
an application (Exh. PP) to the police seeking the post mortem examination 
of the dead body of the deceased. Upon the application (Exh. PP) of Nasir 
Iqbal (PW-3), Dr. Tariq Azhar (PW-8) conducted the post mortem 
examination of the dead body of the deceased namely Naveed Iqbal on 
16.08.2019. Thereafter, Nasir Iqbal (PW-3) filed an application under 
sections 22-A and 22-B of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898  (Exh. DB) 
on 19.09.2019 complaining of the non-registration of the F.I.R . It was

4) and confessed their guilt of having committed the Qatl-i-Amd of Naveed 
Iqbal (deceased).  The written application (Exh.PC) was submitted for the

18.06.2020, to which the appellant pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.   
5. 
  The prosecution in order to prove its case got recorded statements of 
as many as ten witnesses. The prosecution witness namely Nasir Iqbal (PW-
3) submitted the application (Exh.PP) on 15.08.2019 requesting the post 
mortem examination of the dead body and further stated that the appellants 
on 30.11.2019 at about 07.00 p.m confessed their guilt in his and in the

Final Opinion: 
 
 On 20.11.2019, police submitted an application Exh.PK alongwith PFSA 
reports duly attested and signed by me. 
 
 
As per Forensic Toxicology report bearing No.2019-251759-TOX-14209 
bearing Sr.No.0000652382 Exh.PL that drug/poison were not detected in liver 
and stomach contents in item #1, and as per Forensic Histopathology report 
bearing No.2019-251759-PATH-07288 bearing Sr.No.0000638483 Exh.PM that 
Histological examination of heart section reveals patent coronaries and 
unremarkable myocardium. The lungs section reveal focally presence of 
oedematous fluid inside a veoli. The liver renal and splenic section reveal no 
pathological changes. Keeping in view the autopsy findings and above mentioned 
laboratory reports, I opined that the death is because of asphyxia due to throttling 
and smothering. 
 
7. 
 On 29.09.2020 the learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor gave up 
prosecution witness namely Rashid Iqbal as being unnecessary. On 
30.06.2021, the learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor closed the 
prosecution evidence.  
8. 
 After the closure of prosecution evidence, the learned trial court 
examined the appellants namely Kashif Nouman alias Kashi son of Sarfraz 
Hussain and Mst. Nuzhat Rasheed widow of Naveed Iqbal under section 342 
Cr.P.C. and in answer to the question why this case against you and why the 
PWs have deposed against you, the appellants replied that they were 
innocent and had been falsely involved in the case due to suspicion. The

appellants namely Kashif Nouman alias Kashi son of Sarfraz Hussain and 
Mst. Nuzhat Rasheed widow of Naveed Iqbal opted not to get themselves 
examined under section 340(2) Cr.P.C and did not adduce any evidence  in 
their defence.  
9. 
  On the conclusion of the trial, the learned trial court convicted and 
sentenced the appellants as referred to above.   
10. 
  The contention of the learned counsels for the appellants precisely is 
that the whole case was fabricated and false. The learned counsels for the 
appellants further submitted that the prosecution remained unable to prove 
the facts in issue and did not produce any unimpeachable, admissible and 
relevant evidence. The learned counsels for the appellants added that the 
statements of prosecution witnesses were not worthy of any reliance. The 
learned counsels for the appellants also argued that the recoveries were full 
of procedural defects, of no legal worth and value and result of fake 
proceedings. The learned counsels for the appellants finally submitted that 
the prosecution had failed to prove the case against the appellants beyond 
the shadow of doubt.   
11. 
  On the other hand, the learned Additional Prosecutor General and the 
learned counsel for the complainant contended that the prosecution had 
proved its case beyond a shadow of a doubt by producing independent 
witnesses. The learned Additional Prosecutor General and the learned 
counsel for the complainant further argued that the deceased was murdered 
by the appellants who had confessed to the said crime before the witnesses.

The learned Additional Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the 
complainant further argued that the recoveries from the appellants also 
corroborated the statements of the other witnesses. The learned Additional 
Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the complainant contended 
that there was no occasion for the prosecution witnesses, who were related to 
the deceased, to substitute the real offenders with the innocent in this case. 
Lastly, the learned Additional Prosecutor General and the learned counsel 
for the complainant prayed for the rejection of appeals as lodged by both the 
appellants. 
12. 
We have heard the learned counsels for the appellants, the learned 
Additional Prosecutor General, the learned counsel for the complainant and 
carefully perused the record and evidence recorded during the trial. 
13. 
After consideration of contentions raised by learned counsel for the 
respective parties and scanning the evidence, it is pertinent to mention here 
that in the instant matter ocular evidence is not available. There can be no 
dispute regarding the fact that the case is built on circumstantial evidence. In 
dealing with circumstantial evidence, the rules specially applicable to such 
evidence must be borne in mind. In such cases, there is always the danger 
that conjecture or suspicion may take the place of legal proof and therefore, 
it is right to recall the warning addressed by Baron Alderson to the jury in 
Reg. V. Hodge, (1938) 2 Lewin 227) where he said:  
  "The mind was apt to take a pleasure in adapting circumstances to one 
another, and even in straining them a little, if need be, to force them to 
form parts of one connected whole; and the more ingenious the mind of 

Murder Reference No.33 of 2021

the individual, the more likely was it, considering such matters, to 
overreach and mislead itself, to supply some little link that is wanting , to 
take for granted some fact consistent with its previous theories and 
necessary to render them complete." 
 Sir Alfred Wills in his book “An Essay on the Principles of Circumstantial 
Evidence” (pages 173 to 190 of the Fifth American ,from the Fourth London 
Edition published in 1872 ) lays down the following rules specially to be 
observed in the case of circumstantial evidence:  
“RULE 1.-The facts  alleged as the basis of any legal inference must be clearly 
proved, and indubitably connected with the factum probandum. 
RULE 2.-  The burden of proof is always on the party who asserts the existence 
of any fact which infers legal accountability 
RULE  3.-  In  all cases, whether of  direct or  circumstantial evidence, the best 
evidence must be  adduced which the nature of  the case admits . 
RULE 4.-  In order to justify the inference of guilt the inculpatory facts must 
be   incompatible with the innocence of   the accused, and incapable of 
explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt. 
RULE 5.   If   there be  any reasonable doubt of   the guilt of   the accused, he  
is  entitled, as  of right, to  be   acquitted.” 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in its binding judgment titled 
"Naveed Asghar and two others Vs. The State" (P L D 2021 Supreme 
Court 600) has enunciated the following principle of law for the 
appreciation of circumstantial evidence:  
          "Approach to determine sufficiency of circumstantial evidence 

Murder Reference No.33 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 526-J of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 527-J of 2021 
 
10 
 
14. The settled approach to deal with the question as to sufficiency of 
circumstantial evidence for conviction of the accused person is this: If, on 
the facts and circumstances proved, no hypothesis consistent with the 
innocence of the accused person can be suggested, the case is fit for 
conviction of the accused person on such conclusion; however, if such 
facts and circumstances can be reconciled with any reasonable hypothesis 
compatible with the innocence of the appellant, the case is to be treated 
one of insufficient evidence, resulting in acquittal of the accused person. 
Circumstantial evidence, in a murder case, should be like a well-knit 
chain, one end of which touches the dead body of the deceased and the 
other the neck of the accused. No link in chain of the circumstances should 
be broken and the circumstances should be such as cannot be explained 
away on any reasonable hypothesis other than guilt of accused person. 
Chain of such facts and circumstances has to be completed to establish 
guilt of the accused person beyond reasonable doubt and to make the plea 
of his being innocent incompatible with the weight of evidence against 
him. Any link missing from the chain breaks the whole chain and renders 
the same unreliable; in that event, conviction cannot be safely recorded, 
especially on a capital charge. Therefore, if the circumstantial evidence is 
found not of the said standard and quality, it will be highly unsafe to rely 
upon the same for conviction; rather, not to rely upon such evidence will a 
better and a safer course." 
 
Thus, in a case of circumstantial evidence, the prosecution must establish 
each instance of incriminating circumstance by way of reliable and clinching 
evidence, and the circumstances so proved must form a complete chain of 
events, on the basis of which no conclusion other than one of guilt of the 
accused can be reached. Undoubtedly, suspicion, however grave it may be, 
can never be treated as a substitute for proof. 
14.      From the evidence of the prosecution available on record it is clear 
that the case of the prosecution hinges upon the  extra-judicial confession of 
the appellants, the recovery of the pillow (P-3), the Call Data Record  
(Exh.PT/1 and Exh.PT/2), the motive of the occurrence and the pointing out 
of the place of murder of the deceased.   
15.      Firstly, we shall deliberate upon the evidence of the prosecution 
witnesses namely Nasir Iqbal (PW-3) and Javed Iqbal (PW-4) who stated 

Murder Reference No.33 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 526-J of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 527-J of 2021 
 
11 
 
that on 30.11.2019 at about 07.00 p.m., when both the witnesses were 
present in the house of Javed Iqbal (PW-4), both the appellants namely 
Kashif Noman alias Kashi and Mst. Nuzhat Rasheed came to the house of 
Javed Iqbal (PW-4) and confessed their guilt of having committed the Qatl-
i-Amd of Naveed Iqbal (deceased). The said statements of the prosecution 
witnesses namely Nasir Iqbal (PW-3) and Javed Iqbal (PW-4) are reflective 
that the appellants jointly confessed to their guilt. The prosecution witness 
namely Nasir Iqbal (PW-3) ,in his statement before the learned trial court, 
stated as under:- 
“On 30.11.2019, 1 alongwith Javed Iqbal and Rashid Iqbal was present at the 
house of Javed Iqbal at about 7:00 pm, meanwhile accused persons namely 
Mst.Nuzhat Rasheed and Kashif Nauman arrived there and told us that they 
committed murder of Naveed Iqbal deceased on 15.08.2019 by strangulation. 
They said that they were repenting on that murder and beg pardon from us. 
They also asked us not to proceed against them on that murder. ” (emphasis 
supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Javed Iqbal (PW-4), in his statement before 
the learned trial court ,stated as under:- 
“ On 30.11.2019, I alongwith Nasir Iqbal and Rashid Iqbal was present at my 
house, meanwhile accused persons namely Mst.Nuzhat Rasheed and Kashif 
Nauman came there and told us that they committed murder of Naveed Iqbal 
deceased on 15.08.2019 by strangulation. They said that they were repenting on 
that murder and beg pardon from us.”

The alleged extra judicial confession, as already observed, was jointly made 
by the appellants before the prosecution witnesses namely Nasir Iqbal (PW-
3) and Javed Iqbal (PW-4). It was not mentioned by the prosecution 
witnesses namely Nasir Iqbal (PW-3) and Javed Iqbal (PW-4) as to which of 
the two appellants disclosed which fact, because both the appellants could 
not have uttered the same words. So, no reliance whatsoever can be placed 
upon the alleged joint extra judicial confession of the appellants , allegedly 
made before the prosecution witnesses namely Nasir Iqbal (PW-3) and Javed 
Iqbal (PW-4), as the same was a joint extrajudicial confession which is 
neither a relevant nor an admissible piece of evidence. The august Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in the case of “Zafar Iqbal and others Vs. The State” 
(2006 S C M R 463) has held as under: 
“This Court in the case of the "State v. Kamal Khan alias Maloo and another" as 
referred (supra) has disbelieved extra-judicial confession made by the accused 
being a joint confession and maintained the acquittal of the accused. Similarly, B 
Shariat Appellate Bench of this Court in the case of Wazir Muhammad referred 
(supra) has also disbelieved the extra-judicial confession and has acquitted the 
accused o n  the ground that it was a weak type of evidence and requires strong 
corroboration. We have also gone through the case of Maqsood Ahmed referred 
(supra), whereby learned same Judge of the High Court has acquitted the accused 
giving him the benefit of doubt while disbelieving the joint extra-judicial 
confession and other similar circumstances. 
12. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that prosecution has failed to prove the 
case against the appellants.” 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “State Vs. KAMAL 
KHAN alias MALOO and another” (1993 S C M R 1378) has held as under: 

Murder Reference No.33 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 526-J of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 527-J of 2021 
 
13 
 
“Even otherwise too if the version of Ghulam Rasool (P.W.6) is accepted as 
correct, it was the case of a joint confession which could not be used against 
either of them. The learned Trial Court was therefore justified in not acting upon 
it.” 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Muhammad Ismail 
and others Vs. The State” (2017 S C M R 898) has held as under: 
“The prosecution had also maintained that some of the appellants had made an 
extra¬ judicial confession but the High Court had itself discarded the evidence 
relating to the extra-judicial confession as the same was not only unnatural but 
was also inadmissible in evidence as the extra judicial confession attributed to the 
appellants was a joint confession.” 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Muhammad Bashir 
and another Vs. The State and others” (2023 S C M R 190) has held as 
under: 
 ‘”The crux of the argument that there was a confessional statement on the part 
of all the co-accused is of no avail as the same was made jointly, which has no 
legal sanctity.  
16. 
It is also a fact that on 30.11.2019, the prosecution witnesses were 
clueless regarding the circumstances of the death of the deceased and in that 
scenario there hardly existed any reason for the appellants to have confessed 
their guilt when they were not even facing any scrutiny or even suspicion 
with regard to the death of the deceased. We have also noted that the conduct 
of the prosecution witnesses namely Nasir Iqbal (PW-3) and Javed Iqbal 
(PW-4) that both the witnesses, though being the real brothers of the 

Murder Reference No.33 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 526-J of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 527-J of 2021 
 
14 
 
deceased,  did not react at all to the said alleged confessional statements of 
appellants and calmly allowed the appellants  to leave the house of the 
prosecution witness namely Javed Iqbal (PW-4)  after hearing the alleged 
confession of the appellants, without making any effort to apprehend the 
appellants. The prosecution witnesses namely Nasir Iqbal (PW-3) and Javed 
Iqbal (PW-4) have not mentioned in their statements that the accused had 
some weapon which could have precluded them from apprehending the 
appellants when they had heard the appellants confess to their guilt about the 
murder. The prosecution witness namely Javed Iqbal (PW-4) during cross-
examination, admitted as under:- 
“ At the same time we never arrested or caught hold Mst.Nuzhat or any other 
person and I told Mst. Nuzhat that she should go to police and make confession 
to the police. We did not say anything to Mst Nuzhat and allowed her to go and 
other person” 
 The conduct of the prosecution witnesses namely Nasir Iqbal (PW-3) and 
Javed Iqbal (PW-4) was not natural at all. There is no explanation as to why 
the arrest of the appellants was not made by the prosecution witnesses 
namely Nasir Iqbal (PW-3) and Javed Iqbal (PW-4) after hearing of the 
alleged extra judicial confession by the appellants reflecting that indeed no 
such confession was ever made..  
17. 
Another reason to reject the statements of the prosecution witnesses 
namely Nasir Iqbal (PW-3) and Javed Iqbal (PW-4) that on 30.11.2019 at 
about 07.00 p.m., when both the witnesses were present in the house of 
Javed Iqbal (PW-4) , both the appellants namely Kashif Noman alias Kashi

15 
 
and Mst. Nuzhat Rasheed came to the house of Javed Iqbal (PW-4) and 
confessed their guilt of having committed the Qatl-i-Amd of Naveed Iqbal 
(deceased), is that they never reported the matter of the confession of the 
appellants on 30.11.2019 to the police and it was only on 07.12.2019 at 
05.15 p.m that the prosecution witness namely Nasir Iqbal (PW-3) submitted 
the application (Exh.PC) to Zafar Hussain, SI (PW-10) at Bilal Chowk for 
the registration of the F.I.R and in which application the allegation of the 
appellants having confessed to their guilt on 30.11.2019 was mentioned. It 
has not been explained at all that why the matter of confession of the 
appellants was not reported immediately. The delay with which the 
application (Exh.PC) was submitted by Nasir Iqbal to Zafar Hussain, SI 
(PW-10) on 07.12.2019 is proof of the fact that the delay was used to 
fashion out and concoct a false narrative against the appellants. Reliance is 
placed on the case of “Ghulam Abbas and another v. The State and another” 
(2021 SCMR 23) wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan observed 
as under:- 
“As per contents of FIR, the occurrence in this case took place on 
19.06.2008 at 01.40 a.m. and the matter was reported to the Police on the 
same morning at 07.00 a.m. and as such there is a delay of more than five 
hours in reporting the crime to the Police whereas Police Station was 
situated at a distance of just six kilometers from the place of occurrence. 
No explanation whatsoever was furnished by the complainant for this 
delay in reporting the crime to the Police. Hameed Ullah Khan SI (PW.15) 
who investigated the case stated during his cross-examination that he 
reached at the place of occurrence at about 05.00 a.m. and he had 
completed the police proceedings by 06.30 p.m. In the circumstances, 
chances of deliberations and consultations before reporting the matter to 
the Police cannot be ruled out.” 
Reliance is also placed on the case of  MUHAMMAD ASHRAF JAVEED and 
another vs. MUHAMMAD UMAR and others (2017 SCMR 199) wherein 
the august Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased to hold as under: 

Murder Reference No.33 of 2021

“The hospital is closely situated to the Police Station but neither the 
complainant nor PWs took a little pain to report the matter, nor the staff of 
the hospital including the treating doctor took initiative.” 
Guidance is also sought from the principle enunciated by the august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan  in the case of Zafar vs. The State  and others 
(2018 SCMR 326) where the august Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased 
to hold as under:- 
 “It has been observed by us that the occurrence in this case as per 
prosecution took place on 03.09.1999 at 3.00 a.m. (later half of night) and 
the matter was reported to the police on the same day at 8.30 a.m. i.e. 
after five hours and thirty minutes of the occurrence. The distance between 
the place of occurrence and the police station is 09 miles. The postmortem 
on the dead body of deceased was conducted on the same day at 2.00 p.m. 
i.e. after 11 hours of the occurrence. No explanation whatsoever has been 
given by the complainant Shahadat Ali (PW5) and Umer Daraz (PW6) in 
the FIR or while appearing before the learned trial Court qua the delay in 
lodging the FIR or for that matter the belated postmortem of the 
deceased.” 
Guidance is sought from the principles enunciated by the august Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in the cases of “G. M. NIAZ Vs. The State” (2018 SCMR 
506), Abdul Jabbar and another Vs. The State (2019 S C M R 129) and 
Muhammad Shafi alias Kuddoo Vs.  The State and others (2019 S C M R 
1045).  
18. 
We have also noted with grave concern that though the prosecution 
witnesses namely Nasir Iqbal (PW-3) and Javed Iqbal (PW-4) stated that on 
30.11.2019 at about 07.00 p.m., when both the witnesses were present in the 
house of Javed Iqbal (PW-4) , both the appellants namely Kashif Noman 
alias Kashi and Mst. Nuzhat Rasheed came to the house of Javed Iqbal (PW-
4) and confessed their guilt of having committed the Qatl-i-Amd of Naveed 
Iqbal (deceased), the prosecution witness namely Ahsan Zafar (PW-5) 
admitted during cross-examination that even till 08.12.2019, neither he nor 

Murder Reference No.33 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 526-J of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 527-J of 2021 
 
17 
 
any of the witnesses related to the deceased, including the prosecution 
witness namely Nasir Iqbal (PW-3) , the complainant of the case , had any 
knowledge about the involvement of the appellants in the Qatl-i-Amd of the 
deceased. The prosecution witness namely Ahsan Zafar (PW-5) admitted 
during cross-examination , as under:- 
“Nasir Iqbal complainant is my real uncle. Naveed Iqbal deceased was also my 
uncle. It is correct that till 08.12.2019, I and my family members were not in 
knowledge that who committed his murder ” (emphasis supplied)  
The above referred portion of the cross-examination of the prosecution 
witness namely Ahsan Zafar (PW-5) itself is sufficient to reject the 
statements of the prosecution witnesses namely Nasir Iqbal (PW-3) and 
Javed Iqbal (PW-4) that on 30.11.2019, the appellants had confessed to their 
guilt as it was admitted by the prosecution witness namely Ahsan Zafar 
(PW-5) that even till 08.12.2019, neither he nor any of the witnesses related 
to the deceased, including the prosecution witness namely Nasir Iqbal (PW-
3) , the complainant of the case , had any knowledge about the involvement 
of the appellants in the Qatl-i-Amd of the deceased. 
19. 
The learned Additional Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for 
the complainant have also laid much reliance on the statements of the 
prosecution witnesses namely Ahsan Zafar (PW-5) and Muhammad Shahbaz 
(PW-6) who both stated that on 08.12.2019, at about 11 a.m.-12.00 noon, the 
appellant namely Kashif Noman alias Kashi met the said witnesses and 
confessed his guilt of having committed the Qatl-i-Amd of Naveed Iqbal 

Murder Reference No.33 of 2021

(deceased). According to the settled jurisprudence, there could be a few 
motivating factors for making a confession like: (i) to boast off (ii) to 
ventilate the suffocating conscience and (iii) to seek help when actually 
trapped by investigation. Boasting off is very rare in such heinous offences 
where fear dominates and if boasting is the motivation it is always done 
before an extreme confidant as well as the one who shares close secrets. To 
make a confession in order to give vent to one's pressure on mind and 
conscience is another aspect of the same psyche. One gives vent to one's 
feelings only before a strong and close confidant.  Another motivation for 
making a confession can be to seek the help of a person in a position to help 
him escape when trapped during the investigation. A perusal of the 
statements of the prosecution witnesses namely Ahsan Zafar (PW-5) and 
Muhammad Shahbaz (PW-6) reveals that there did not exist any of the above 
mentioned reasons which could have made the appellant namely Kashif 
Noman alias Kashi confess before the said prosecution witnesses namely 
Ahsan Zafar (PW-5) and Muhammad Shahbaz (PW-6). It was admitted by 
the prosecution witnesses namely Ahsan Zafar (PW-5) and Muhammad 
Shahbaz (PW-6) that they had not ever met the appellant namely Kashif 
Noman alias Kashif before 08.12.2019, the day when allegedly the appellant 
namely Kashif Noman alias Kashi confessed before the prosecution 
witnesses namely Ahsan Zafar (PW-5) and Muhammad Shahbaz (PW-6). 
The prosecution witness namely Ahsan Zafar (PW-5) during cross-
examination admitted as under:- 

Murder Reference No.33 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 526-J of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 527-J of 2021

“It is correct that when Kashif Nauman came to us on 08.12.2019 neither he was 
known to us nor we were known to him.  
………… 
Prior to 08.12.2019 Kashif Nauman was not known to me.” 
The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Shahbaz (PW-6) , during the 
cross-examination , admitted as under:- 
“I was not earlier familiar with the accused person Kashif Nauman. ” 
In the instant case, the position of the witnesses before whom extra-judicial 
confession was made was such that they were neither the close confidants of 
the accused nor in any manner said to be sharing any habit or association 
with the accused rather both the prosecution witnesses namely Ahsan Zafar 
(PW-5) and Muhammad Shahbaz (PW-6) were not even known to the 
appellant namely Kashif Noman alias Kashi. Both the possibilities for 
confessing; boasting or ventilating, in the circumstances, were not there. 
Moreover, as mentioned above, the prosecution witness namely Ahsan Zafar 
(PW-5) admitted during cross-examination that till 08.12.2019, he did not 
have any clue with regard to the identity of the person involved in the 
murder of the deceased namely Naveed Iqbal. One finds it hard to 
understand as to why the appellant would make his breast clean when 
apparently he was under no compulsion to oblige the prosecution which was 
clueless about the circumstances leading to the death of the deceased. The 
alleged extra-judicial confession is so detailed and comprehensive that it 
covers almost every aspect of the prosecution case; it is in fact an 

Murder Reference No.33 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 526-J of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 527-J of 2021 
 
20 
 
encyclopedia of the prosecution case. A man under the stress of 
compunction of his conscious is not supposed to give such minute details 
that too on the assurance of help. Therefore, when the appellant namely 
Kashif Noman alias Kashi was not even suspected , for him to have 
confessed for seeking help of the prosecution witnesses namely Ahsan Zafar 
(PW-5) and Muhammad Shahbaz (PW-6) , when actually trapped by the 
investigation, was also not a circumstance haunting the appellant namely 
Kashif Noman alias Kashi.  
20. 
We have also noted that though the prosecution witnesses namely 
Ahsan Zafar (PW-5) and Muhammad Shahbaz (PW-6) were closely related 
to the deceased , however both the prosecution witnesses namely Ahsan 
Zafar (PW-5) and Muhammad Shahbaz (PW-6),  did not respond at all to the 
said alleged confessional statement of appellant namely Kashif Noman alias 
Kashi and calmly allowed him  to leave the petrol pump of the prosecution 
witness namely Muhammad Shahbaz (PW-6) after hearing the alleged 
confession of the appellant namely Kashif Noman alias Kashi. The  
prosecution witnesses namely Ahsan Zafar (PW-5) and Muhammad Shahbaz 
(PW-6)  candidly admitted in their statements that the appellant namely 
Kashif Noman alias Kashi was allowed to leave by them after they had heard 
him confess to his guilt about the murder. The prosecution witness namely 
Ahsan Zafar (PW-5) during cross-examination , admitted as under:- 
“ Shahbaz s/o Abdul Hameed PW of this case is my close relative. 
…….

I did not apprehend the accused Kashif Nauman when he came to me and made 
extra judicial confession. Shahbaz and Naveed are not the real brothers. Shahbaz 
also did not make any effort to apprehend the accused Kashif Nauman. We let 
him to go.” (emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Shahbaz (PW-6)   during cross-
examination , admitted as under:- 
“ I cannot apprehend the accused at that time. We also did not apprehend the 
accused” 
 This demeanor of the prosecution witnesses namely Ahsan Zafar (PW-5) 
and Muhammad Shahbaz (PW-6) was not natural at all and even otherwise 
contrary to normal human behaviour.   
21. 
We have also noted that both the prosecution witnesses namely Ahsan 
Zafar (PW-5) and Muhammad Shahbaz (PW-6) candidly admitted that they 
never told the fact of the confession made by the appellant namely Kashif 
Noman alias Kashi before them on 08.12.2019 at 12.00 noon to the police on 
the said day. The prosecution witness namely Ahsan Zafar (PW-5), during 
cross-examination, admitted as under:- 
“ On 08.12.2019 after knowledge I had not immediately informed to the 
police or any other family members. I on the spot telephonically informed to 
my uncle Javed Iqbal. My uncle did not come with police at the patrol pump 
station. I myself did not go to the police station anyhow I do not know about my 
uncle whether he went to the police station or not.”

Criminal Appeal    No. 527-J of 2021 
 
22 
 
The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Shahbaz (PW-6) , during 
cross-examination , admitted as under:- 
“I do not know that on the day when the accused Kashif Nauman made extra 
judicial confession anybody informed to the police or not. In my presence my 
friend Ahsan Zafar did not inform to his uncle or any other family member 
about the extra judicial confession of the accused Kashif Nauman. I cannot 
remember that after extra judicial confession of the accused Kashif Nauman after 
how many days I went to the police station for the first time. I went to the police 
station on 5/6 occasion. I also got recorded my statement U/s 161 Cr.P.C. I 
cannot remember that after how many days I got recorded the statement to 
the police when the accused came at my petrol pump. Ahsan Zafar is my 
relative and friend from my childhood” (emphasis supplied)  
It is trite that the delayed recording of the statement of a prosecution witness 
under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 reduces its value 
to nothing unless there is a plausible explanation for such delay. No 
explanation, much less plausible, has been given by the prosecution 
witnesses namely Ahsan Zafar (PW-5) and Muhammad Shahbaz (PW-6) for 
not getting their statements under section 161 of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure, 1898 recorded immediately and therefore no value can be 
attached to his statement. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case 
of “Abdul Khaliq Vs. The State” (1996 SCMR 1553) has held as under: 
“It is a settled position of law that late recording of 161, Cr.P.C. 
statement of a prosecution witness reduces its value to nill unless there is 
plausible explanation for such delay”.

The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Muhammad Khan Vs. 
Maula Bakhsh” (1998 SCMR 570) has held as under: 
“It is a settled law that credibility of a witness is looked with serious 
suspicion if his statement under section 161, Cr.P.C is recorded with delay 
without offering any plausible explanation”.  
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Syed Saeed 
Muhammad Shah and another Vs. The State” (1993 SCMR 550) at page 
571 has held as under: 
“In the absence of satisfactory nature of explanation normally rule is that 
statements recorded by police after delay and without explanation are to 
be ruled out of consideration. In this case unsatisfactory explanation 
which is not substantiated can be equated with no explanation”.  
22. 
    After an overwhelming analysis of the prosecution evidence with 
regard to extra-judicial confession, we have come to the conclusion that the 
prosecution has manufactured the said evidence of extra-judicial confessions 
of the appellants in this case to strengthen the case against the appellants 
after taking legal advice in this regard. In these eventualities, the statements 
of the prosecution witnesses namely Ahsan Zafar (PW-5), Muhammad 
Shahbaz (PW-6), Nasir Iqbal (PW-3) and Javed Iqbal (PW-4) about the  
extra-judicial confessions of the appellants are provenly  not proved. Even 
otherwise, extra-judicial confession is a very weak type of evidence and the 
same obviously needs impartial and strong corroboration from other 
independent sources which is missing in this case. The evidentiary value of 
the extra-judicial confession came up for consideration before august 

Murder Reference No.33 of 2021

Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of "Sajid Mumtaz and others v. 
Basharat and others" (2006 SCMR 231), wherein, at page 238, the Apex 
Court of Pakistan observed as under:- 
"17. ......This Court and its predecessor Court (Federal Court) have 
elaborately laid down the law regarding extra-judicial confessions staring 
from Ahmed v. The Crown PLD 1951 FC 103-107 up to the latest. Extra 
judicial confession has always been taken with a pinch of salt. In Ahmed v. 
The Crown, it was observed that in this country (as a whole) extra-judicial 
confession must be received with utmost caution. Further, it was observed 
from time to time, that before acting upon a retracted extra-judicial 
confession, the Court must inquire into all material points and surrounding 
circumstances to "satisfy itself fully that confession cannot but be true". As, 
an extra¬judicial confession is not a direct evidence, it must be corroborated 
in material particulars before being made the basis of conviction. 
 
18. It has been further held that the status of the person before whom 
the extra-judicial confession is made must be kept in view, that joint 
confession cannot be sued against either of them and that it is always a weak 
type of evidence which can easily be procured whenever direct evidence is 
not available. Exercise of utmost care and caution has always been the rule 
prescribed by this Court. 
 
19. It is but a natural curiosity to ask as to why a person of sane mind 
should at all confess. No doubt the phenomenon of confession is not 
altogether unknown but being a human conduct, it had to be visualized, 
appreciated and consequented upon purely in the background of a human 
conduct. 
 
20. Why a person guilty of offence entailing capital punishment 
should at all confess. There could be a few motivating factors like: (i) to 
boast off (ii) to ventilate the suffocating conscience and (iii) to seek help 
when actually trapped by investigation. Boasting off is very rare in such-like 
heinous offences where fear dominates and always done before an extreme 
confident as well as the one who shares close secrets. To make confession in 
order to give vent to ones pressure on mind and conscience is another aspect 
of the same psyche. One gives vent to ones feelings and one removes 
catharses only before a strong and close confident. In the instant case the 

Murder Reference No.33 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 526-J of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 527-J of 2021 
 
25 
 
position of the witnesses before whom extra-judicial confession is made is 
such that they are neither the close confident of the accused nor in any 
manner said to be sharing any habit or association with the accused. Both 
the possibilities of boasting and ventilating in the circumstances are excluded 
from consideration. 
 
21. Another most important and natural purpose of making extra-
judicial confession is to seek help from a third person. Help is sought firstly, 
when a person is sufficiently trapped and secondly, from one who is 
authoritative, socially or officially....... 
 
22. As observed by the Federal Court, we would reiterate especially 
referring to this part of the country, that extra-judicial confessions have 
almost become a norm when the prosecution cannot otherwise succeed. 
Rather, it may be observed with concern as well as with regret that when the 
Investigating Officer fails to properly investigate the case, he resorts to 
padding and concoctions like extra-judicial confessions. Such confessions by 
now, have become the signs of incompetent investigation. A judicial mind, 
before relying upon such weak type of evidence, capable of being effortlessly 
procured must ask a few questions like why the accused should at all confess; 
what is the time lag between the occurrence and the confession, whether the 
accused had been fully trapped during investigation before making the 
confession, what is the nature and gravity of the offence involved, what is the 
relationship or friendship of the witnesses with the maker of confession and 
what, above all is the position or authority held by the witness". 
In the case of "Mst. Asia Bibi v. The State and others" (P L D 2019 
Supreme Court 64) wherein, the august Supreme Court of Pakistan was 
pleased to observe as under:- 
“In this regard it is to be noted that this Court has repeatedly held that 
evidence of extra-judicial confession is a fragile piece of evidence and 
utmost care and caution has to be exercised in placing reliance on such a 
confession. It is always looked at with doubt and suspicion due to the ease 
with which it may be concocted. The legal worth of the extra judicial 
confession is almost equal to naught, keeping in view the natural course of 
events, human behaviour, conduct and probabilities, in ordinary course. It 
could be taken as corroborative of the charge if it, in the first instance, rings 
true and then finds support from other evidence of unimpeachable 

Murder Reference No.33 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 526-J of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 527-J of 2021 
 
26 
 
character. If the other evidence lacks such attribute, it has to be excluded 
from consideration. Reliance in this behalf may be made to the cases of 
Nasir Javaid v. State (2016 SCMR 1144), Azeem Khan and another v. 
Mujahid Khan and others (2016 SCMR 274), Imran alias Dully v. The State 
(2015 SCMR 155), Hamid Nadeem v. The State (2011 SCMR 1233), 
Muhammad Aslam v. Sabir Hussain (2009 SCMR 985), Sajid Mumtaz and 
others v. Basharat and others (2006 SCMR 231), Ziaul Rehman v. The State 
(2000 SCMR 528) and Sarfraz Khan v. The State and 2 others (1996 SCMR 
188).” 
Keeping in view the guidelines given by august Supreme Court of Pakistan 
in the above mentioned judgments, we palpably discard the evidence of 
extra-judicial confessions of the appellants manufactured by the prosecution 
to strengthen its case. This part of the evidence is nothing but a tailored 
narrative, which was arranged with the help of the Investigating Agency 
thus, it is of no legal worth and being absolutely unreliable, is excluded from 
consideration. 
23. 
 
According to the prosecution case, the Qatl-i-Amd of Naveed 
Iqbal (deceased) was committed in his house. It is also an admitted fact of 
the prosecution case that the place of occurrence was occupied by the 
children of Naveed Iqbal (deceased). All the four prosecution witnesses 
namely Nasir Iqbal (PW-3), Javed Iqbal (PW-4), Ahsan Zafar (PW-5) and 
Muhammad Shahbaz (PW-6) stated in their statements before the learned 
trial court that Naveed Iqbal  (deceased), was blessed with the birth of two 
children and the said children were present in the same house where the 
occurrence took place. The prosecution witness namely Nasir Iqbal (PW-3)  
stated during cross-examination , as under:-

“Deceased was married about 14/15 years back. Deceased have two children 
namely Muhammad Jasim aged about 8 years and Mutaiba aged about 13 years 
……. 
After the occurrence Mst. Nuzhat and her two children remained in the same 
house for about one month after the occurrence of the instant case. 
…… 
It is correct that Mst. Nuzhat accused, her deceased husband and two children 
who are aged about 13 years and 8 years respectively, were residing in the 
same house where occurrence took place. It is correct that when I reached at 
the place of occurrence both children of my deceased brother were present 
there. Mst.Nuzhat was also present in the house when I reached, at the place of 
occurrence.” (emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Javed Iqbal (PW-4) also admitted during 
cross-examination, as under:- 
“It is correct that my deceased brother had two children aged about 13 years and 8 
years and they resided jointly in the house.” 
The prosecution witness namely Ahsan Zafar (PW-5) also admitted during 
cross-examination , as under:- 
“When I reached at the place of occurrence, Mst.Nuzhat Rasheed alongwith her 
children and father and many people from the vicinity were present there. ” 
The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Shahbaz (PW-6)  also admitted 
during cross-examination , as under:- 

Murder Reference No.33 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 526-J of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 527-J of 2021

“My relative Naveed Iqbal used to run Rickshaw. Naveed Iqbal had three children 
which were residing in that house prior to the occurrence.” 
Neither during the course of investigation nor before the learned trial court, 
the statements of the children of Naveed Iqbal (deceased), who were 
admittedly the residents of the place of occurrence and were also present 
there at the time of occurrence, were recorded. Nasir Iqbal (PW-3) the 
complainant of the case, could have and should have produced the said 
children of the deceased not only before the Investigating Officer of the case 
but also before the learned trial court. Moreover, there is no evidence on 
record that on the day of occurrence, at the time of occurrence, the said 
children were living somewhere else than with their parents. Zafar Hussain , 
SI (PW-10), the Investigating Officer of the case, also failed to include in the 
investigation the inhabitants of the house where the occurrence had taken 
place and this joint failure of the prosecution witnesses including Nasir Iqbal 
(PW-3) , the complainant of the case and Zafar Hussain, SI (PW-10), the 
Investigating Officer of the case,  to produce the said inhabitants of the place 
of occurrence before the learned trial court, reflects poorly upon the veracity 
of the prosecution case. Article 129 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 provides 
that if any evidence available with the parties is not produced, then it shall 
be presumed that had that evidence been produced the same would have 
been gone against the party producing the same. Illustration (g) of the said 
Article 129 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 reads as under:- 
“(g) that evidence which could be and is not produced would, if 
produced, be unfavourable to the person who withholds it.”

The failure of the prosecution to produce, the children of the deceased , who 
were admittedly the residents of the place of occurrence and the most natural 
witnesses, before the learned trial court, has convinced us that had they been 
produced before the learned trial court they would not have supported the 
prosecution case. Reliance in this matter is placed on the case of 
SHAMSHAD versus THE STATE (1998 SCMR 854 also cited as 1999 
SCMR 2844) wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan held as under:- 
“10. The prosecution has also failed to offer a plausible explanation as to 
why the children of the appellant, who were, admittedly, present in the 
house at the time of the incident, were not produced as witnesses in the 
case. In fact, the children of the appellant were the most natural witnesses 
of the occurrence, However, the Investigating Officer thought it fit not to 
examine them as witnesses. When confronted with this situation at the 
time of his cross-examination he explained that two daughters and the 
son of the appellant were less than 7 years of age. However, in the same 
breath it was admitted by him that Ruhi Bano was about 8 or 9 years of 
age. The other children were a few years younger. However, at least the 
older children under normal circumstances could have given evidence in 
the Court. The explanation given by the Investigating Officer, therefore, 
was not tenable. 
……………………………………….. 
13. Learned State Counsel has however, argued that in case the 
prosecution had failed to examine any of the appellant’s children as a 
witness, they should have been examined as defence witnesses. It has 
been further argued that if there are two versions, one given by the 
prosecution and the other by the defence, then if the latter is not believed, 
the prosecution version must be believed as true. In our view, both the 
contentions are untenable. Burden to prove its case beyond a reasonable 
doubt squarely rests on the prosecution. Such burden cannot be 
discharged by weaknesses found in the case of the defence. The mere fact 
that the defence version is not believed by the Court cannot lend credence 
to the prosecution case if, otherwise, the prosecution has failed to 
discharge its burden. For the reason enumerated above, we have no 
hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the prosecution has failed to 
establish its case against the appellant.”(emphasis supplied)  
Reliance is also placed on the case of Lal Khan versus THE STATE (1996 
SCMR1846) wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan held as under:- 

Murder Reference No.33 of 2021

“The prosecution is certainly not required to produce a number of witnesses as 
the quality and not the quantity of the evidence is the rule but non-production of 
most natural and material witnesses of occurrence, would strongly lead to an 
inference of prosecutorial misconduct which would not only be considered a 
source of undue advantage for possession but also an act of suppression of 
material facts causing prejudice to the accused. The act of withholding of most 
natural and a material witness of the occurrence would create an impression 
that the witness if would have been brought into witness-box, he might not have 
supported the prosecution and in such eventuality the prosecution must not be in 
a position to avoid the consequence.” 
Reliance is also placed on the case of USMAN alias KALOO versus THE 
STATE (2017 SCMR 622) wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan 
held as under:- 
“A peculiar feature of this case is that the inmates of the house of occurrence, i.e. 
the mother, wife and children of Noor Muhammad deceased had never been 
associated with the investigation of this case and no statement of the said natural 
witnesses had been recorded by the investigating officer nor were they produced 
before the trial court”. 
 
Reliance is also placed on the cases of Muhammad Irshad Vs. Allah Ditta 
and others (2017 SCMR 142) and G. M. NIAZ Vs. The State”  (2018 SCMR 
506). In this manner, the prosecution case suffers from inherent defects 
which are irreconcilable as it is. 
24. 
The learned Additional Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for 
the complainant  have vehemently argued that the disclosure of the appellant 
namely Mst. Nuzhat Rasheed made at the time when she pointed out the 
place of murder of the deceased on 09.12.2019 and as contained in the 
memo (Exh. PD)  was admissible and relevant and amounted to a confession 
of guilt under the provisions of article 40 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 
1984. The discovery of any fact on the information of the accused in custody 

Murder Reference No.33 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 526-J of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 527-J of 2021

of Police is admissible under article 40 of  the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 
1984, which reads as under:- 
"40. How much of information received from accused may be proved. 
When any fact is deposed to as discovered in consequence of information 
received from a person accused of any offence, in the custody of a police-
officer, so much of such information, whether it amounts to a confession or 
not, as relates distinctly to the fact thereby discovered, may be proved." 
A perusal of above article 40 of  the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984  reveals 
firstly that it serves as a proviso to Articles 38 and 39 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984. It comes into operation only if and when certain facts 
are deposed to as discovered in consequences of information received from 
an accused person in police custody. Thus, in order to apply Article 40 of the 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, the prosecution must establish that 
information given by the accused led to the discovery of some fact deposed 
by him and the discovery must be of some fact which the police had not 
previously learnt from any other source. According to the prosecution case 
itself, the place of occurrence was known to the witnesses already since 
15.08.2019 and no new fact was discovered in consequence of pointing out 
of the place of occurrence by the appellant namely Mst. Nuzhat Rasheed on 
09.12.2019. Hence, the alleged statement of the appellant namely Mst. 
Nuzhat Rasheed made in police custody at the time when she pointed out the 
place of murder of the deceased cannot be read in evidence and would 
remain inadmissible. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of  
Fazal Subhan and another Vs. The State  and others (2019 S C M R 1027) 
has enunciated the following principle:- 

Murder Reference No.33 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 526-J of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 527-J of 2021 
 
32 
 
“Memo of pointing out of place of occurrence cannot be equated with 
disclosure within the contemplation Article 40 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat 
Order, 1984.” 
25. 
 The learned Additional Prosecutor General  and the learned counsel 
for the complainant, have submitted that the recovery of the Pillow (P-3) 
from the appellant namely Kashif Noman alias Kashi offered sufficient 
corroboration of the statements of the prosecution witnesses namely Nasir 
Iqbal (PW-3), Javed Iqbal (PW-4) , Ahsan Zafar (PW-5) and Muhammad 
Shahbaz (PW-6). Regarding the recovery of the Pillow (P-3) from the 
appellant namely Kashif Noman alias Kashi, the same cannot be relied upon 
as the Investigating Officer of the case, did not join any witness of the 
locality during the recovery of the Pillow (P-3) from the appellant namely 
Kashif Noman alias Kashi which was in clear violation of section 103 Code 
of Criminal Procedure, 1898. The provisions of section 103 Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1898, unfortunately, are honoured more in disuse than 
compliance. To appreciate it better, this section is being reproduced:- 
"103.--(1) Before making a search under this chapter, the officer or other person 
about to make it shall call upon two or more respectable inhabitants of the locality 
in which the place to be searched is situate to attend and witness the search and 
may issue an order in writing to them or any of them so to do.” 
Therefore, the evidence of the recovery of the Pillow (P-3) from the 
appellant namely Kashif Noman alias Kashi cannot be used as incriminating 
evidence against the appellant, being evidence that was obtained through 
illegal means and hence hit by the exclusionary rule of evidence. The august

Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Muhammad Ismail and others Vs. 
The State ( 2017 SCMR 898) at page 901 has held as under:- 
“For the above mentioned recovery of weapons the prosecution had failed to 
associate any independent witness of the locality and, thus, the mandatory 
provisions of section 103, Cr.P.C. had flagrantly been violated in that regard.”  
Furthermore, it is admitted part of the prosecution case that Zafar Hussain SI 
(PW-10), Investigating Officer of the case, on 07.12.2019 had visited the 
house from where the pillow (P-3) was recovered and remained there for a 
substantial period of time and in that scenario, had the pillow (P-3)  been 
present in the same house, then its presence must have been noted by Zafar 
Hussain SI (PW-10), Investigating Officer of the case, however it was not. 
The prosecution witness namely Nasir Iqbal (PW-3) during cross-
examination , admitted as under:- 
“When Kashif was arrested and on his pointation a pillow P-3 was recovered 
after four months of the day of occurrence from the place of occurrence. The 
pillow was of common nature. Pillow was never recovered in my presence. ” 
(emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Javed Iqbal (PW-4), during cross-
examination , admitted as under:- 
“During the investigation from the place of occurrence one pillow was recovered 
on the pointation of accused person. The cover of pillow was in two colour 
Badami and Kalaji colour. At this time pillow is not present in the court.  
……. 

Murder Reference No.33 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 526-J of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 527-J of 2021 
 
34 
 
It is correct that pillow was of common category and is easily available in the 
market ” 
The most important fact relating to the recovery of pillow (P-3) is that Zafar 
Hussain, SI (PW-10) , the Investigating Officer of the case , admitted during 
cross-examination that the said pillow (P-3) was recovered from the house 
which was in the possession of the complainant namely Nasir Iqbal and his 
family.  Zafar Hussain, SI (PW-10), the Investigating Officer of the case, 
during the cross-examination, stated as under:- 
“It is correct that during investigation accused Kashif Nauman disclosed and got 
recovered a Pillow on 24.01.2020 from the place of occurrence. This Pillow was 
recovered after about five months of the occurrence. When Pillow was recovered 
from the place of occurrence that place was in possession of complainant and 
their family members  from the date of occurrence ” (emphasis supplied). 
All these facts denude the effort made by Zafar Hussain SI (PW-10), 
Investigating Officer of the case to prop up the failing prosecution case by 
showing sham recovery of the pillow (P-3). 
26. 
The prosecution has also relied upon the Call Data Record (Exh.PT/1 
and Exh.PT/2) collected during the investigation of the case related to the 
Subscriber Identity Module (P-4) recovered from the appellant namely 
Kashif Noman alias Kashi on 28.01.2020, so as to prove the guilt of the 
appellants. Admittedly no voice record or its transcript has been brought on 
record. It is stressed that in the absence of any voice call data or record, 
simply the production of the Call Data Record without the disclosure of the 
details of the conversations is not relevant to prove any fact supporting the 

Murder Reference No.33 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 526-J of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 527-J of 2021 
 
35 
 
prosecution case against the appellants.  Reliance is placed on the case of 
“Azeem Khan and another Vs. Mujahid Khan and others” (2016 SCMR 
274), wherein, it has been held as under:- 
“The cell phone call data collected is of no help to the prosecution for 
the reasons that numerous calls have been made indicating continuous 
interaction between the two cell phones, contrary to the evidence given 
by Muhammad Wali (PW-3), who has stated at the trial that the 
unknown caller made calls on his cell phone four times. No competent 
witness was produced at the trial, who provided the call data, Ex.P-1 to 
Ex.P-5. No voice record transcript has been brought on record. 
Similarly from which area the caller made the calls, is also not shown 
in it. Above all, the most crucial and conclusive proof that the cell 
phone was owned by the accused and SIM allotted was in his name is 
also missing. In this view of the matter, this piece of evidence is 
absolutely inconclusive and of no benefit to the prosecution nor it 
connects the accused with the crime in any manner.” 
 
27.  
The learned Additional Prosecutor General and the learned counsel 
for the complainant have also relied upon the evidence of motive and 
submitted that it corroborated the ocular account. The motive of the 
occurrence as stated by Nasir Iqbal (PW-3) in his written application   (Exh. 
P.C.) was that the appellants namely Kashif Noman alias Kashi and Mst. 
Nuzhat Rasheed had developed an illicit liaison and as the deceased 
discovered the said relationship, therefore, both the appellants committed his 
murder. We have perused the statements of the prosecution witnesses namely 
Nasir Iqbal (PW-3), Javed Iqbal (PW-4), Ahsan Zafar (PW-5) and 
Muhammad Shahbaz (PW-6) and find that they failed to prove the motive of 
the occurrence as stated by them. The prosecution witness namely Nasir 
Iqbal (PW-3), admitted during cross-examination that he himself had never 
seen the appellants in the company of each other and further admitted that 
even the deceased had not ever reported the matter of illicit relationship of 

Murder Reference No.33 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 526-J of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 527-J of 2021 
 
36 
 
the appellants with each other to the police. The prosecution witness namely 
Nasir Iqbal (PW-3) admitted during cross-examination , as under:- 
“I never saw the accused Mst.Nuzhat Rasheed and Kashif Nauman in their illicit 
relation. They were caught red handed by my deceased brother. He never initiated 
any legal proceedings against the accused Mst.Nuzhat Rasheed or accused Kashif 
Nauman regarding their illicit relationship. 
…….. 
I never saw Mst.Nuzhat in any objectionable condition with Kashif Nauman or 
any other person from the day of Nikah till today. ” 
Similarly, the prosecution witness namely Javed Iqbal (PW-4) also admitted 
that he himself had never witnessed the appellants in the company of each 
other. Javed Iqbal (PW-4), during cross-examination, stated as under:- 
“I never saw Mst.Nuzhat with anybody in objectionable condition from the day of 
marriage till today ” 
The prosecution witness namely Ahsan Zafar (PW-5) also admitted that he 
had no knowledge about the relationship of the appellants with each and 
stated during cross-examination, as under:- 
“It is correct that I personally do not know about the illicit relations between Mst. 
Nuzhat Rasheed and Kashif Nauman accused present in the court ” 
The prosecution witness namely Ahsan Zafar (PW-5) also admitted the lack 
of any knowledge regarding the relationship of the appellants with each 
other and stated during cross-examination, as under:- 

Murder Reference No.33 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 526-J of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 527-J of 2021 
 
37 
 
“ I myself have not witnessed any illicit relation of the accused Kashif Nauman 
with Nuzhat Rasheed.” 
The Investigating Officer of the case also did not collect any evidence in 
support of the alleged motive of the occurrence. Zafar Hussain, SI (PW-10), 
the  Investigating Officer of the case , during cross-examination, stated as 
under:- 
“It is correct that during my investigation not a single witness of complainant 
party or neighbourars gave statement that they saw both the accused in an 
objectionable condition or in a compromising position prior to occurrence of this 
case ” 
It was also admitted that the deceased had contracted marriage with the 
appellant about fourteen years prior to the occurrence and was also living 
with the appellant at the time of occurrence. There is no evidence on record 
that Naveed Iqbal (deceased) was facing any threat to his life at the hands of 
the appellants prior to the occurrence rather to the contrary he was living 
with the appellant namely Mst. Nuzhat Rasheed till his tragic death. We have 
also noted that the appellant namely Mst. Nuzhat Rasheed and Naveed Iqbal  
(deceased) were blessed with the birth of as many as two children. This also 
proves that the appellant namely Mst. Nuzhat Rasheed and the deceased 
were having a happy and a healthy marital life and hence there did not exist 
any reason for the appellant namely Mst. Nuzhat Rasheed to have murdered 
her loving husband. The prosecution witnesses failed to provide evidence 
enabling us to determine the truthfulness of the motive alleged, and the fact 
that the said motive was so compelling that it could have led the appellant to 

Murder Reference No.33 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 526-J of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 527-J of 2021 
 
38 
 
have committed the Qatl-i-Amd of the deceased. There is a poignant hush 
with regard to the particulars of the motive alleged. No independent witness 
was produced by the prosecution to prove the motive as alleged. Even 
otherwise a tainted piece of evidence cannot corroborate another tainted 
piece of evidence. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in the 
case of Muhammad Javed v. The State (2016 SCMR 2021) as under: 
“The said related and chance witnesses had failed to receive any 
independent corroboration inasmuch as no independent proof of 
the motive set up by the prosecution had been brought on the 
record of the case.” 
 
28. 
It has been argued by the learned Additional Prosecutor General and 
the learned counsel for the complainant that where any person dies an 
unnatural death in the house of such accused, then some part of the onus lies 
on that person to establish the circumstances in which such unnatural death 
had occurred. The prosecution is bound to prove its case against an accused 
person beyond a reasonable doubt at all stages of a criminal case and in a 
case where the prosecution asserts the presence of some eye-witnesses and 
such claim of the prosecution is not established by it, there the accused 
person could not be convicted merely on the basis of a presumption that 
since the murder of a person had taken place in his house, therefore, it must 
be he and none else who would have committed that murder. The learned 
Additional Prosecutor General submits that it was in the knowledge of the 
appellant namely Mst. Nuzhat Rasheed how the deceased died so it was the 
appellant namely Mst. Nuzhat Rasheed who was responsible, in the absence 
of any explanation. The law on the burden of proof, as provided in Article 

Murder Reference No.33 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 526-J of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 527-J of 2021 
 
39 
 
117 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, mandates the prosecution to prove, and 
that too, beyond any doubt, the guilt of the accused for the commission of 
the crime for which he is charged. The said provision provides: 
“117. Burden of proof:- (1) Whoever desires any Court to give judgment as to 
any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of facts which he 
asserts, must prove that those facts exist.  
(2) When a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact, it is said that 
the burden of proof lies on that person.” 
On a conceptual plain, Article 117 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 enshrines 
the foundational principle of our criminal justice system, whereby the 
accused is presumed to be innocent unless proved otherwise. Accordingly, 
the burden is placed on the prosecution to prove beyond doubt the guilt of 
the accused, which burden can never be shifted to the accused, unless the 
legislature by express terms commands otherwise. It is only when the 
prosecution is able to discharge the burden of proof by establishing the 
elements of the offence, which are sufficient to bring home the guilt of the 
accused then, the burden is shifted upon the accused, inter alia, under Article 
122 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, to produce evidence of facts, which are 
especially in his exclusive knowledge, and practically impossible for the 
prosecution to prove, to avoid conviction. Article 122 of  Qanun-e-
Shahadat,1984 reads as under: 
“122. Burden of proving fact especially within knowledge:- When any fact is 
especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden to proving that 
fact is upon him.” 
It has to be kept in mind that Article 122 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 
comes into play only when the prosecution has proved the guilt of the 

Murder Reference No.33 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 526-J of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 527-J of 2021 
 
40 
 
accused by producing sufficient evidence, except the facts referred in Article 
122 Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, leading to the inescapable conclusion that the 
offence was committed by the accused. Then, the burden is on the accused 
not to prove his innocence, but only to produce evidence enough to create 
doubts in the prosecution’s case. It may be noted that this issue was also 
dilated upon by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan, in the case of 
“Rehmat alias Rahman alias Waryam alias Badshah v. The State” (PLD 
1977 SC 515), where, while deliberating upon Section 106 of the Evidence 
Act, which is para materia with Article 122 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, 
held as under: 
“Needless to emphasis that in spite of section 106 of the Evidence Act in 
criminal case the onus rests on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the 
accused beyond reasonable doubt and this section cannot be construed to 
mean that the onus at any stage shifts on to the accused to prove his innocence 
or make up for the inability and failure of the prosecution to produce evidence 
to establish the guilt of the accused. Nor does it relieve! the prosecution of the 
burden to bring the guilt home to the accused. It is only after the prosecution 
has on the evidence adduced by it, succeeded in raising reasonable inference 
of the guilt of the accused, unless the same is rebutted, that this section 
wherever applicable, comes into play and the accused may negative the 
inference by proof of some facts within his special knowledge. If, however, the 
prosecution fails to prove the essential ingredients of the offence, no duty is 
cast on the accused to prove his innocence.” 
The ratio decidendi of the above decision was further developed in the case of 
“Nasrullah Alias Nasro Versus The STATE (2017 S C M R 724), wherein, it 
has been held as under: 
“It has been argued by the learned counsel for the complainant that in the 
cases of Arshad Mehmood v. The State (2005 SCMR 1524) and Saeed Ahmed 
v. The State (2015 SCMR 710) this Court had held that where a wife of a 
person or any vulnerable dependent dies an unnatural death in the house of 
such person then some part of the onus lies on him to establish the 
circumstances in which such unnatural death had occurred. The learned 
counsel for the complainant has maintained that the stand taken by the 
appellant regarding suicide having been committed by the deceased was 
neither established by him nor did it fit into the circumstances of the case, 
particularly when the medical evidence contradicted the same. Be that as it 
may holding by this Court that some part of the onus lies on the accused 

Murder Reference No.33 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 526-J of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 527-J of 2021 
 
41 
 
person in such a case does not mean that the entire burden of proof shifts to 
the accused person in a case of this nature. It has already been clarified by 
this Court in the case of Abdul Majeed v. The State (2011 SCMR 941) that the 
prosecution is bound to prove its case against an accused person beyond 
reasonable doubt at all stages of a criminal case and in a case where the 
prosecution asserts presence of some eye-witnesses and such claim of the 
prosecution is not established by it there the accused person could not be 
convicted merely on the basis of a presumption that since the murder of his 
wife had taken place in his house, therefore, it must be he and none else who 
would have committed that murder.  
……………………………………………………….. 
In a case of this nature the appellant could not have been convicted for the 
alleged murder merely because he happened to be the husband of the 
deceased.” 
In a criminal case, the burden of proof is on the prosecution and Article 122 
of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 is certainly not intended to relieve it of that 
duty. On the contrary, it is designed to meet certain exceptional cases in 
which it would be impossible, or at any rate disproportionately difficult, for 
the prosecution to establish facts which are “especially” within the 
knowledge of the accused and which he could prove without difficulty or 
inconvenience. If the Article 122 of the Qanun-¬e-Shahadat, 1984  was to be 
interpreted otherwise, it would lead to the very startling conclusion that in a 
murder case, the burden lies on the accused to prove that he did not commit 
the murder because who could know better than he whether he did or did 
not. Article 122 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 cannot be used to undermine 
the well-established rule of law that, save in a very exceptional class of 
cases, the burden is on the prosecution and never shifts. Throughout the web 
of the Law, one golden thread is always to be seen, that it is the duty of the 
prosecution to prove the accused’s guilt subject to any statutory exception. 
No matter what the charge, the principle that the prosecution must prove the 
guilt of the accused is the law and no attempt to whittle it down can be 
entertained. As discussed above, the prosecution failed miserably to prove 

Murder Reference No.33 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 526-J of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 527-J of 2021 
 
42 
 
the charge against the appellants. In a case of this nature, the appellant 
namely Mst. Nuzhat Rasheed could not have been convicted for the alleged 
murder merely because she happened to be one of the residents of the place 
of occurrence. An accused person cannot be convicted merely because she 
did not explain the circumstances in which the deceased had lost his life. 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in the case of 
“MUHAMMAD JAMSHAID and another vs. The State and others” (2016 
SCMR 1019 ) as under: 
“only circumstance relied upon by the prosecution was that the deadbody of 
the deceased had been found inside the house of the appellant and, hence, it 
was concluded by the courts below that it must be none other than the present 
appellant who had done the deceased to death. We have found such an 
approach adopted by the courts below to be nothing but speculative”. 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in the case of “Arshad Khan  
vs. The State” (2017 SCMR 564 ) as under: 
“It may be true that it has been held by this Court in the cases of Arshad 
Mehmood v. The State (2005 SCMR 1524) and Saeed Ahmed v. The State 
(2015 SCMR 710) that in such cases some part of the onus lies on the 
accused person to explain as to how and in which circumstances the accused 
person’s wife had died an unnatural death inside the confines of the 
matrimonial home but at the same time it has also been clarified by this 
Court in the case of Abdul Majeed v. The State (2011 SCMR 941) that where 
the prosecution completely fails to discharge its initial onus there no part of 
the onus shifts to the accused person at all.” 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in the case of Nazeer Ahmed 
vs. The State (2016 SCMR 1628 ) as under: 
“It may be true that when a vulnerable dependant is done to death inside the 
confines of a house, particularly during a night, there some part of the onus 
lies on the close relatives of the deceased to explain as to how their near one 
had met an unnatural death but where the prosecution utterly fails to prove 
its own case against an accused person there the accused person cannot be 
convicted on the sole basis of his failure to explain the death. These aspects 
of the legal issue have been commented upon by this Court in the cases of 
Arshad Mehmood v. The State (2005 SCMR 1524), Abdul Majeed v. The State 
(2011 SCMR 941) and Saeed Ahmed v. The State (2015 SCMR 710).”

The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in the case of Asad Khan vs. 
The State (PLD 2017 Supreme Court 681 ) as under: 
“It had been held by this Court in the case of Arshad Mehmood v. The State 
(2005 SCMR 1524) that where a wife of a person dies an unnatural death in 
the house of such person there some part of the onus lies on him to establish 
the circumstances in which such unnatural death had occurred. In the later 
case of Saeed Ahmed v. The State (2015 SCMR 710) the said legal position 
had been elaborated and it had been held that an accused person is under 
some kind of an obligation to explain the circumstances in which his 
vulnerable dependent had met an unnatural death within the confines of his 
house; It had, however, been held in the case of Abdul Majeed v. The State 
(2011 SCMR 941) that where the entire case of the prosecution stands 
demolished or is found to be utterly unbelievable there an accused person 
cannot be convicted merely because he did not explain the circumstances in 
which his wife or some vulnerable dependent had lost his life. In such a case 
the entire burden of proof cannot be shifted to him in that regard if the case of 
the prosecution itself collapses. The present case is a case of the latter 
category wherein the entire case of the prosecution has been found by us to 
be utterly unbelievable and the same stands demolished and, thus, we cannot 
sustain the appellant’s conviction and sentence merely on the basis of an 
inference or a supposition qua his involvement.” 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in the case of Abdul Majeed 
vs. The State (2011 SCMR 941 ) as under: 
“The basic principle of criminal law is that it is the burden of the prosecution 
to prove its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. This burden 
remains throughout and does not shift to the accused, who is only burdened 
to prove a defence plea, if he takes one. The strangulation to death of the 
appellant’s wife in his house may be a circumstance to be taken into account 
along with the other prosecution evidence. However; this by itself would not 
be sufficient to establish the appellant’s guilt in the absence of any other 
evidence of the prosecution connecting him to the crime. The prosecution has 
also not been able to establish that the appellant was present in the house at 
the time his wife was murdered. This, perhaps, distinguishes this case from 
that of “Afzal Hussain Shah v. The State” (ibid) where the accused admittedly 
was present in the house when his wife was killed.” 
 
29. 
The only other piece of evidence left to be considered by us is the 
medical evidence with regard to the injuries observed on the dead body of 
the deceased by Dr. Tariq Azhar (PW-8) but the same is of no assistance in 
this case as medical evidence by its nature and character, cannot recognize a 
culprit in case of an unobserved occurrence. As all the other pieces of

evidence relied upon by the prosecution, in this case, have been disbelieved 
and discarded by us, therefore, the appellants’ conviction cannot be upheld 
on the basis of medical evidence alone. The august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in its binding judgment titled “Hashim Qasim and another Vs. The 
State” (2017 SCMR 986) has enunciated the following principle of law:  
“The medical evidence is only confirmatory or of supporting nature and is 
never held to be corroboratory evidence, to identify the culprit.”   
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in its binding judgment titled 
“Naveed Asghar and two others Vs. The State” (P L D 2021 Supreme Court 
600) has enunciated the following principle of law:  
“31. 
The prosecution has attempted to complete the chain of circumstantial 
evidence by medical evidence relating to the post mortem examinations of the 
deceased persons. This evidence proves only the factum that death of the 
deceased persons was caused by cutting their throats through some sharp edge 
weapon; it does in no way indicate who had cut their throats and with what 
particular weapon. Medical evidence is in the nature of supporting, 
confirmatory or explanatory of the direct or circumstantial evidence, and is 
not “corroborative evidence” in the sense the term is used in legal parlance 
for a piece of evidence that itself also has some probative force to connect the 
accused person with the commission of offence. Medical evidence by itself 
does not throw any light on the identity of the offender. Such evidence may 
confirm the available substantive evidence with regard to certain facts 
including seat of the injury, nature of the injury, cause of the death, kind of the 
weapon used in the occurrence, duration between the injuries and the death, 
and presence of an injured witness or the injured accused at the place of 
occurrence, but it does not connect the accused with the commission of the 
offence. It cannot constitute corroboration for proving involvement of the 
accused person in the commission of offence, as it does not establish the 
identity of the accused person.32 Therefore, the medical evidence is of little 
help to the prosecution for bringing home the guilt to the petitioners.” 
 
30.         In view of the above we are of the considered opinion that the self-
negating and contradictory statements of the prosecution witnesses reflect 
that the prosecution witnesses are not truthful and they are supporting the

afterthought, fabricated and concocted story meant to create incriminating 
evidence to strengthen the case of unwitnessed occurrence against the 
appellants. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Imran alias 
Dully and another Vs. the State and  others (2015 SCMR 155) at page 164 
has held as under:- 
“By now, it is a consistent view that  when any case rests entirely on 
circumstantial evidence then, each piece of evidence collected must provide 
all links making out one straight chain where on one end its noose fit in the 
neck of the accused and the other end touches the dead body. Any link 
missing from the chain would disconnect and break the whole chain to 
connect the one with the other and in that event conviction cannot be safely 
recorded and that too on a capital charge.” 
To carry a conviction on a capital charge it is essential that the courts should 
deeply scrutinize the circumstantial evidence because fabricating of such 
evidence is not uncommon and a very minute and narrow examination of the 
same is necessary to secure the ends of justice. It is imperative for the 
prosecution to provide all links in the chain, where one end of the same 
touches the dead body and the other the neck of the accused. The present 
case is of such a nature that many links are missing in the chain. It would not 
be wrong to observe that in this particular case, it can be said that there is no 
link, what to talk about a chain. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the 
case of Fiaz Ahmad Vs. The State (2017 SCMR 2026) has observed at page 
2030 as under:- 
“It may also be kept in mind that sometimes the investigating agency 
collects circumstantial evidence seems apparently believable 
however, if the strict standards of scrutiny are applied there would 
appear many cracks and doubts in the same which are always

inherent therein and in that case Courts have to discard and 
disbelieve the same.” 
 
31.      Considering all the above circumstances, we entertain serious doubt 
in our minds regarding the involvement of the appellants namely Kashif 
Nouman alias Kashi son of Sarfraz Hussain and Mst. Nuzhat Rasheed 
widow of Naveed Iqbal  in the present case. It is a settled principle of law 
that for giving the benefit of the doubt it is not necessary that there should be 
so many circumstances rather, if only a single circumstance creating 
reasonable doubt in the mind of a prudent person is available, then such 
benefit is to be extended to an accused not as a matter of concession but as 
of right. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of "Muhammad 
Mansha Vs. The State" (2018 SCMR 772) has enunciated the following 
principle: 
"Needless to mention that while giving the benefit of doubt to an accused it 
is not necessary that there should be many circumstances creating doubt. 
If there is a circumstance which creates reasonable doubt in a prudent 
mind about the guilt of the accused, then the accused would be entitled to 
the benefit of such doubt, not as a matter of grace and concession, but as a 
matter of right. It is based on the maxim, "it is better that ten guilty 
persons be acquitted rather than one innocent person be convicted". 
Reliance in this behalf can be made upon the cases of Tariq Pervez v. The 
State (1995 SCMR 1345), Ghulam Qadir and 2 others v. The State (2008 
SCMR 1221), Muhammad Akramv.The State (2009 SCMR 230) and 
Muhammad Zamanv.The State (2014 SCMR 749)." 
 
Reliance is also placed on the judgment of the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan "Najaf Ali Shah Vs. the State" (2021 S C M R 736) in which it has 
been held as:- 
"9. 
Mere heinousness of the offence if not proved to the hilt is not a 
ground to avail the majesty of the court to do complete justice. This is 
an established principle of law and equity that it is better that 100 
guilty persons should let off but one innocent person should not suffer. 
As the preeminent English jurist William Blackstone wrote, "Better that 

Murder Reference No.33 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 526-J of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 527-J of 2021 
 
47 
 
ten guilty persons escape, than that one innocent suffer." Benjamin 
Franklin, who was one of the leading figures of early American history, 
went further arguing "it is better a hundred guilty persons should 
escape than one innocent person should suffer." All the contradictions 
noted by the learned High Court are sufficient to cast a shadow of 
doubt on the prosecution's case, which entitles the petitioner to the 
right of benefit of the doubt. It is a well settled principle of law that for 
the accused to be afforded this right of the benefit of the doubt it is not 
necessary that there should be many circumstances creating 
uncertainty and if there is only one doubt, the benefit of the same must 
got to the petitioner. This Court in the case of Mst. Asia Bibi v. The 
State (PLD 2019 SC 64) while relying on the the earlier judgments of 
this Court has categorically held that "if a single circumstance creates 
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the apprehension of guilt of 
an accused, then he/she shall be entitled to such benefit not as a matter 
of grace and concession, but as of right. Reference in this regard may 
be made to the cases of Tariq Pervaiz v. The State (1998 SCMR 1345) 
and Ayub Masih v. The State (PLD 2002 SC 1048)." The same view was 
reiterated in Abdul Jabbar v. State (2010 SCMR 129) when this court 
observed that once a single loophole is observed in a case presented by 
the prosecution, such as conflict in the ocular account and medical 
evidence or presence of eye-witnesses being doubtful, the benefit of 
such loophole/lacuna in the prosecution's case automatically goes in 
favour of an accused."
