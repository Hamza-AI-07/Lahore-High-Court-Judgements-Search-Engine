ASIM HAFEEZ, J. This Regular First Appeal, under section 
22 of the Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) 
Ordinance 2001 (“Ordinance, 2001”), is directed against the 
judgment and decree dated 14.04.2022 (impugned judgment), 
whereby learned Single Judge in chambers, exercising 
jurisdiction under the Ordinance, 2001, decreed the claim of 
respondent Financial Institution against the appellants, jointly 
and severally, for Rs.425,100,369.86 with costs of funds in 
terms of Section 3 of the Ordinance, 2001 and costs of the suit.  
2. 
Facts essential for adjudication of the appeal are that 
respondent, on request made through appellant’s Board 
Resolution of 27.03.2018 and accompanied with loan 

RFA No.30994/2022 
2
application, approved renewal and enhancement of Cash 
Finance [Pledge] Limit - CF-Facility -, through facility offer 
letter of 27.04.2018, which was accepted and followed by 
execution of finance and security documents, including 
promissory note, personal guarantees and letter of pledge [all 
executed post-facility offer letter]. Terms and condition of 
finance were contained in the facility offer letter and reiterated 
through Finance Agreement – having reference to Purchase 
price 
of 
Rs.400,000,000/- 
and 
Marked-up 
Price 
of 
Rs.474,301,370/-. Notably, Facility was valid till 31.03.2019.  
  
Respondent Financial Institution alleged default and 
sued appellants under section 9 of the Ordinance, 2001. 
Appellants appeared and submitted applications for seeking 
unconditional leave to defend the suit, which applications 
were responded through replications. With reference to PLA 
No.33155/2019, respondent submitted Statement of Current 
Account of the appellant No.1 entity and copies of debit 
vouchers, with replication. Learned Judge Banking, upon 
finding absence of any substantial question of law and fact, 
dismissed applications for leave to defend, whereupon suit 
was decreed vide impugned judgment. 
3. 
Learned counsels for the appellants contend that suit 
was not validly instituted, wherein authorization of the officer, 
for instituting suit, was deficient and defective, and unless 
Board Resolution, allegedly passed in the year 1994, is 
produced, the factum of authority of the Officer could not be 

RFA No.30994/2022

determined. Hence, institution of suit is defective. Refers to 
the case of “PICIC Commercial Bank Limited Vs. Spectrum 
Fisheries Limited” (2006 CLD 440), “Messrs Muzamil 
Brothers and another Vs. Saudi Pak Commercial Bank 
Limited through Manager” (2006 CLD 1546), Judgment 
dated 27.05.2021 in RFA No.80/2015. 
  
Submits that appellants disputed claim of disbursement 
of funds, since no document was attached with the plaint to 
substantiate disbursement of facility. Adds that respondent 
submitted statement of account with replication, to which 
document no opportunity to object was allowed, therefore 
appellants are per se entitled for grant of unconditional leave 
to defend, in wake of placement of document with replication. 
Adds that statements of accounts attached with plaint and 
replication failed to meet the mandatory requirements of 
section 9 of the Ordinance, 2001 and provisions of Bankers’ 
Books Evidence Act, 1891. Refers to the cases reported as, 
“Jamal Tube (Pvt) Ltd, Lahore through Chief Executive Officer 
and others Vs. First Punjab Modarba, Lahore” (2021 CLD 1372), 
“Decent Builders and Developers Vs. Standard Chartered Bank 
(Pakistan) Limited” (2021 CLD 130), “DECENT BUILDERS AND 
DEVELOPERS and others. Vs. STANDARD CHARTERED BANK 
(PAKISTAN) LIMITED.”  (2021 CLD 130), “Obaid Associates 
through Proprietor and another Vs. United Bank Limited” (2021 
CLD 1019), “Messrs First Dawood Investment Bank Limited 
through Authorized officers / Attorneys Vs. Mrs. Anjum Saleem and 
3 others” (2016 CLD 920), “Pak Oman Investment Company 

RFA No.30994/2022

Limited Vs. Chenab Limited and 9 others” (2016 CLD 1903), “The 
Bank of Punjab Vs. Arif Ali Shah Bukhari” (2016 CLD 1301), 
“BANK OF PUNJAB. VS. INTERNATIONAL CERAMICS LTD. 
and others.”  (2013 CLD 1472), “Soneri Bank Limited Vs. Classic 
Denim Mills (Pvt) Limited and 3 others” (2011 CLD 408), 
“Nusrat Textile Mills Ltd and 8 others Vs. United Bank Ltd 
through Attorney” (2005 CLD 1421), “Messrs C.M. Textile Mills 
Pvt Limited through Chairman and 5 others Vs. Investment 
Corporation of Pakistan” (2004 CLD 587), “THE BANK OF 
PUNJAB. VS. FAZAL ABBAS and another.” (2020 CLD 977), 
“NIB BANK LIMITED through Authorized Officer and Special 
Attorney. Vs. MESSRS VENUS CHEMICALS PRIVATE LIMITED 
and others.” (2020 CLD 1227). 
  
Further submits that appellants instituted suit for 
declaration-cum-rendition of accounts, wherein respondent 
Financial Institution had submitted application for seeking 
leave to defend, and leave was granted, whereupon issues 
were framed for the purposes of recording of evidence. Adds 
that one of the issues framed raises dispute qua disbursement 
of funds – which was also in dispute in suit instituted by the 
respondent. Submits that since issues were framed in 
appellant’s suit, therefore it is imperative to grant leave to 
defend the suit to the appellants in respondents’ suit, to 
consolidate the proceeding and record evidence on disputed 
issues. Adds that such course must be adopted to avoid 
conflicting decisions. Reliance is placed to the cases of 
“Zeeshan Energy Ltd and others Vs. Fysal Bank Ltd” (2014 SCMR 

RFA No.30994/2022 
5
1048) and “Muhammad Nawaz Vs. Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited 
through Manager and 2 others” (2013 CLD 1390). 
  
Adds that mere posting of debit entries in the statement 
of account, appended with the plaint, identified as Funds TRF 
would not establish claim, for the purposes of decreeing the 
suit, unless corresponding credit entries were shown and 
established, which material link was lacking. Adds that 
statement of account appended with the replication cannot be 
read unless leave is granted. Adds that transfer entries have 
had to be explained with supporting documents, and failure to 
do the needful would necessitates grant of unconditional leave 
to defend. Reliance is placed on the cases of “Messrs Dhrala 
Oil Mills through Partners / Guarantors and 4 others” (2014 CLD 
153), “Elblow Room and another Vs. MCB Bank Limited” (2014 
CLD 985), “National Bank of Pakistan Vs. Messrs Amna Export 
(Private) Limited and 2 others” (2020 CLD 1243), ““Habib-ur-
Rehman and another Vs. Judge Banking Court No.4, Lahore and 
another” (2006 CLD 217) and “Messrs United Dairies Farms (Pvt) 
Limited and 4 others Vs. United Bank Limited” (2005 CLD 569). 
  
Adds that various applications were filed, raising 
material issues, touching the maintainability of the suit, which 
were not decided, and this amounts to abdication of 
jurisdiction. Reliance is placed on the cases of “Nand Lal Vs. 
Askari Bank Ltd and others” (2018 CLD 1176) and “Messrs M.A. 
Chaudhry and 3 others Vs. National Bank of Pakistan, Faisalabad 
through General Attorney” (2005 CLD 875).  Submits that fair 

RFA No.30994/2022 
6
right to defend was not extended, which violates mandate of 
Article 10-A of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973. Reliance is 
placed on the cases of “National Bank of Pakistan and 117 others 
Vs. SAF Textile Mills Ltd and another” (PLD 2014 Supreme 
Court 283) and “Apollo Textile Mills and others Vs. Soneri Bank 
Ltd” (2012 CLD 337(SC). 
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel appearing for respondent 
submits that statement of account pertaining to the loan 
account, showing adjustment of outstanding facility and fresh 
disbursement, was attached with the plaint, which meets the 
requirements of section 9 of the Ordinance, 2001 and Banker’s 
Book Evidence Act 1891. Adds that statement of current 
account and debit vouchers were submitted to discredit the 
claim of the appellants, who were required to bring on record 
statement of current account but withheld said document 
deceptively. Submits that documents, finance and security, 
were executed to acknowledge the grant of finance facility by 
way of renewal – outstanding liability was adjusted, and fresh 
facility was disbursed, upon allowing draw-down subject to 
conditions, with the obligation of repayment till 31.03.2019. 
Adds that CF-Facility was secured against pledge of stock of 
sugar bags, which was acknowledged through the execution of 
letter of pledge.

Arguments Heard. Record perused.

6. 
We have re-read the judgment impugned and examined 
the record in the context of the submissions, whereafter we 
tend to disagree with the contentions of learned counsels for 
the appellants and affirm the judgment, for the reasons hereby 
follow.  
  
No substantial question of law and fact was raised. Suit 
was validly instituted in terms of section 9 of the Ordinance, 
2001. No specific denial qua execution of documents was 
forthcoming, 
genuineness 
thereof 
was 
convincingly 
established. 
Statements 
of 
accounts 
fulfil 
statutory 
requirements. No serious dispute is raised qua the entries, 
especially the credits entries in the loan accounts – which 
substantiate renewal of CF-facility, adjustment of overdue 
amounts and availability of CF-facility by way of revolving 
credit. Learned counsel emphasized on the objection against 
statement of current account and debit vouchers, attached with 
the replication, claiming grant of unconditional leave to 
defend. Appellants have not disputed or challenged the 
existence and identity of current account, in the name of the 
appellant No.1. Debit entries of Rs.374,999,475/- and 
Rs.25,000,525.00, on 03.05.2018 and 04.05.2018 in loan 
account correspond with credit entries in current account – and 
debit vouchers merely manifest effect given to the transaction 
reflected through entries in statement of loan statement. 
Appellants, while filing applications for leave to defend, for 
the purposes of meeting the requirements envisaged by sub-

RFA No.30994/2022 
8
section (4) of section 10 of Ordinance 2001, alleged certain 
payments, amounting to Rs.153,000,000/-, on 27.04.2018, and 
Rs.246,999,375/- on 30.04.2018 – accumulating to reflect 
overdue liability of Rs.399,999,375/-. Was this amount paid 
by the appellants from personally arranged funds. No, this is 
not the plea raised. Mere lifting of entries from statement of 
loan account and claiming adjustment of liabilities is 
fallacious. This simple juggling of account is not convincing 
to allow unconditional accounts. Accounts depicted that 
outstanding liability of Rs.399,999,375/- was adjusted through 
credit entries and thereafter drawdown was allowed through 
making available funds – drawdown reconciled with the 
execution of the Letter of Pledge on 02.05.2018, affidavit 
dated 03.05.2018, acknowledging submission of Form-10 and 
fulfilment of requirement of registration of Charge with SECP. 
Synchronization between the dates of the execution of finance 
and security documents and entries in accounts matched with 
the terms of financing. Revolving facility was valid till 
31.03.2019. Statement of current accounts provided with 
replication merely exposes the hollowness of plea of lack of 
disbursement of facility. It was in fact the obligation of the 
appellants / customers to provide statement of current 
accounts, in the first place, to dislodge the claim – since it was 
the primary obligation of the customer to raise substantial 
question(s) of law. Statement of loan account, showing 
disbursement of funds in the context of renewal of CF-Facility, 

RFA No.30994/2022 
9
per se meets requirements of law, even if statement of current 
account is not reckoned. Failure to append current account 
statement with application for leave to defend raises 
presumption 
of 
withholding 
of 
material 
information, 
discrediting claim for grant of unconditional leave to defend. 
Series of applications filed, before grant of leave to defend, 
are of no consequence, when appellants failed to raise any 
substantial question of law and facts. Applications for leave to 
defend were submitted and same were decided. No question of 
denial of opportunity to defend arose. Judgments relied upon 
may constitute authorities in the context of facts involved 
therein, which have no applicability to facts of instant appeal. 
Bald denial of execution of finance and security documents is 
not convincing when numerous documents are otherwise 
available on record to substantiate the claim – comprising of 
Board Resolution for seeking renewal of CF-Facility, loan 
application, acceptance of terms of facility offer letter, 
execution of documents, finance and security, registration of 
charge with SECP, are sufficient to dismiss applications for 
grant of leave to defend, etc. 
7. 
Mere institution of suit by the customer, seeking various 
declarations, and grant of unconditional leave to defend to the 
Financial Institution would not per se entitle appellants for 
grant of leave to defend in suit by Financial Institution, as rule 
of the thumb. Judgments referred in this behalf are 
distinguishable in context of the facts. Hence, no illegality is 

RFA No.30994/2022 
10
found to justify interference in exercise of appellate 
jurisdiction. 
8. 
Appeal is without merits and same is, therefore, 
dismissed. No order as to the costs.
