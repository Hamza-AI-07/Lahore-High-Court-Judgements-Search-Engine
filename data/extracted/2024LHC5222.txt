==================================== 
 
MUHAMMAD AMJAD RAFIQ, J:- Through this petition 
orders dated 03.08.2024 and 10.09.2024 passed by the learned 
Additional Sessions Judge, Bhera District Sargodha were assailed 
by the petitioner on the ground that while relying on medical 
report/ossification test, the documentary evidence produced by the 
petitioner in support of his application to declare him the juvenile 
within the meanings of Juvenile Justice System Act, 2018 was 
rejected.  
2.  
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that Section 8 
of the Juvenile Justice System Act 2018 (JJSA 2018) put a primary 
duty upon the police to ascertain the age of the accused on the basis 
of birth certificate, educational certificate or any other pertinent 
documents, and in the absence of such documents police may 
obtain a medical report; but once the police decide that accused is 
juvenile, the Court cannot further dilate upon the veracity of such 
opinion, and jurisdiction of the Court arises only when police fails 
to perform its duty. According to her, the Court can draw such 
power under Section 4(7) of the JJSA 2018 as held in a case 

2 
Crl. Revision No. 56647 of 2024. 
 
reported as „SALEEM KHAN Vs The STATE and others‟ (PLD 
2020 Supreme Court 356). Further states that in this case, challan 
of the accused/ petitioner was sent as juvenile offender therefore, 
learned trial Court was not authorized to conduct inquiry so as to 
reject the documents available in the form of birth certificate, Form 
ب of NADRA (National Database and Registration Authority) and 
school leaving certificate. Also states that as opposed to mandate of 
Section 8 of the JJSA, 2018 learned trial Court has preferred to 
obtain medical report without legal justification. She claims that 
according to the educational and other documents, age of the 
petitioner was less than 18 years, whereas, as per medical report, 
his age was counted as 21/22 years thus, Court should have given 
preference to the educational & other documents over the medical 
report or when two divergent opinions are on the record, one 
favourable to the accused should have been adopted. In support of 
her arguments she has placed reliance on the cases reported as 
'انت
ظار حسین بنام حمزہ امیر و 'غیر (2017 SCMR 633), “KHUSHAL Vs 
The STATE” (2018 YLR 1605), “AHMAD KHAN Vs THE STATE and 
another” (2003 YLR 315) & “SULTAN AHMED Vs ADDITIONAL 
SESSIONS JUDGE-I, MIANWALI and 2 others” (PLD 2004 Supreme 
Court 758). She says that JJSO 2018 is a special law which has 
been enacted to save guaranteed rights of juvenile offenders which 
cannot be taken away lightly. Reliance was also placed on cases 
reported as “MEHRAN Vs UBAID ULLAH and others” (PLD 2024 
Supreme Court 843) & “KHAWAR KAYANI Vs The STATE and 
others” (PLD 2022 Supreme Court 551). Her last submission was 
that unless the documents produced in support of juvenility are held 
fraudulent or bogus, they are to be relied upon. In this respect she 
has referred the case reported as “MUHAMMAD ISHAQ Vs 
MUHAMMAD NADEEM and another” (2002 SCMR 440).  
 
3.  
On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent No.2 
opposed the contentions on the ground that though it is the duty of 
police to assess the age of the offender during investigation for 

3 
Crl. Revision No. 56647 of 2024. 
 
which they are bound to make an inquiry but in this case, neither 
the accused claimed himself as juvenile throughout the 
investigation nor his age was written in the case diary on his arrest 
and police has not also made any inquiry rather on conclusion of 
investigation, with the connivance of the accused party, in already 
drafted challan inserted the word “juvenile”; therefore, when the 
police have not made the inquiry, it was incumbent upon the Court 
under Section 4(7) of the JJSA 2018 to conduct a proper inquiry, as 
explained in the case reported as „SALEEM KHAN Vs The STATE 
and others‟ (PLD 2020 Supreme Court 356). Further stated that 
authenticity of the document is to be decided before accepting it in 
favour of any party because if the documents submitted before the 
Court are accepted without verification, it would open a situation 
when the offender would manage ante-date documents to assert 
juvenility, as has been done in this case. Further states that when 
documents are ambiguous then only option left with the Court is to 
seek and rely on the medical examination report. In this respect he 
has placed reliance on a case reported as “OM PRAKASH Versus 
STATE OF RAJHISTAN and another” (2012 SCMR1400). Thus, he 
supported and defended the impugned orders. Learned Deputy 
Prosecutor General argued that it is the duty of prosecution to 
scrutinize the report under section 173 Cr.P.C. and point out defects 
therein; therefore, concerned District Prosecutor must have raised 
objection about proof in respect of juvenility before sending the 
case to the Court which has not been done in this case.  
4.  
Heard. Record perused.  
5.  
In order to determine the legal position, it is essential to 
reproduce Section 8 of the JJSA 2018. 
8. Determination of age. ---(1) Where a person alleged to 
have committed an offence physically appears or claims to be 
a juvenile for the purpose of this Act, the officer-in-charge of 
the police station or the investigation officer shall make an 
inquiry to determine the age of such person on the basis of his 
birth certificate, educational certificates or any other pertinent 
documents. In absence of such documents, age of such accused 
person may be determined on the basis of a medical 
examination report by a medical officer.  
 

4 
Crl. Revision No. 56647 of 2024. 
 
(2) When an accused person who physically appears to be a 
juvenile for the purpose of this Act is brought before a Court 
under section 167 of the Code, the Court before granting 
further detention shall record its findings regarding age on the 
basis of available record including the report submitted by the 
police or medical examination report by a medical officer. 
  
Section 8 of JJSA 2018 used word „inquiry‟ to determine the age of 
person on the basis of birth certificate, educational certificate or any 
other document, primarily to be made by the police and then by 
Magistrate before order for further detention. It is trite that object of 
the inquiry is to determine the truth or falsity of certain facts in 
order to take further action thereon as held in a case reported as “P. 
Sirajuddin Vs Government of Madras, represented by the Chief 
Secy., Madras and others” (AIR 1968 Madras 117). The Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in a case reported as “SULTAN AHMED Versus 
ADDITIONAL SESSIONS JUDGE-I, MIANWALI and 2 others” (PLD 
2004 Supreme Court 758), has declared that the inquiry for age 
determination is a form of judicial proceedings calling for 
application of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (the Order), which 
says it applies to all judicial proceedings in or before any Court. 
Thus, documents primary or secondary, in support of age of 
accused, shall be not be accepted at the whims of the parties 
without verification but on the touchstone of admissibility rules 
contained in the Order. Reliance in this respect is place on a case 
reported as “MUHAMMAD ASLAM and others Versus THE STATE and 
another” (PLD 2009 Supreme Court 777), wherein it was held as 
under; 
“Entertaining documents handed down from across the bar and 
then acting upon the same, would be fraught with the danger of 
the courts being misled into passing unwarranted orders. Such-
like documents should never be accepted without being tested 
for their authenticity and genuineness which would be possible 
only if the procedure prescribed by the said Order of 1984 was 
followed and where the accused was also put through the 
requisite medical examination.” 
 
6.       Firstly, Let‟s see the requirement of section 8 ibid, which says 
that „in the absence of documents‟, age of accused may be determined 
on the basis of a medical examination report. Absence of documents 

5 
Crl. Revision No. 56647 of 2024. 
 
does not mean that there is no document at all rather it means absence 
of authentic, correct & true documents as admissible in evidence. 
Inquiry for age determination is like a voir dire process (trial within 
trial) which cannot be left at the mercy of police. Enactment of section 
8 ibid requires the police to collect material for and against claim of 
juvenility to save precious time of the Courts so as to avoid 
unnecessary entangling in summoning of stary records on the 
applications of the parties, as was the requirement of section-7 of 
erstwhile law i.e., Juvenile Justice System Ordinance 2000. Thus, once 
the police opinion is made available to the Court with documentary 
proof or with medical examination report, it becomes easy for it to 
conduct a prompt inquiry for early determination of age of accused 
which earlier takes months to reach out. This beneficial provision 
requires that concerned Court on receiving Juvenile-challan shall start 
inquiry to check the veracity of material through the process of 
verification while calling reports from concerned public offices or 
school with authorized persons as witnesses whose testimonies shall be 
recorded in chief with cross examination and then the Court shall pass 
an order. Supreme Court of Pakistan has also passed like direction 
through case reported as “MUHAMMAD ASLAM and others Versus THE 
STATE and another” (PLD 2009 Supreme Court 777), that Court 
should call upon the parties to lead their evidence oral or 
documentary with a right to the other party to test the veracity or the 
genuineness of the same in accordance with law and then to arrive at a 
judicial decision in terms thereof.” Such direction was also followed 
in cases reported as “SAJJAD RASUL Versus ARSLAN ZAIN-UL-
ABIDIN” (2021 MLD 2088); “MIRWISE Versus MOHIB-UR-REHMAN, 
SI/SHO POLICEC STATION, LORALAI and another” (2021 PCr.L.J 
10320); “SAQLAIN Versus THE STATE and others” (2020 PCr.LJ 374); 
“MUHAMMAD AYYAZ Versus THE STATE” (2018 PCr.LJ 132) 
&“JAVED ULLAH Versus THE STATE” (2012 YLR 2076). Form the 
above discussion, it is clear the age of the accused shall only be 
accepted on the basis of documents after proper inquiry. If after 
inquiry into such documents, Court rejects them, then it must direct for 

6 
Crl. Revision No. 56647 of 2024. 
 
medical examination. Reliance is placed on cases reported as “OM 
PRAKASH Versus STATE OF RAJHISTAN and another” (2012 SCMR 
1400);“ZUHAIB ZAFAR Versus THE STATE” (2006 YLR 2052) 
&“DOST MUHMAMMAD Versus THE STATE” (2020 MLD 1384).    
 
7.   Supreme Court of Pakistan while discarding birth certificate 
declared it a volunteered entry by the accused, in a case reported as 
“MUHAMMAD ANWAR Versus MUHAMMAD SUFFYIAN and 
another” (2009 SCMR 1073) as under; 
 
“The entry of date of birth in the above mentioned register 
Dakhil Kharij and in the above mentioned Provisional 
Result 
Certificate 
are 
not 
independent 
sources 
of 
information about the said respondent's date of birth 
because they only followed the information volunteered by 
the student himself or someone connected with him. Since 
such certificates are based on the information about the date 
of birth as volunteered as mentioned above, therefore, the 
same could never be found to be a conclusive proof of the 
concerned person's date of birth.” 
             
                  
8.   Every accused who is under the charge of murder is liable to 
sentence of death if the case stands proved, therefore, to avoid 
death penalty accused is duty bound to prove his claim of being 
juvenile on the basis of true documents and burden of proof lies on 
him. In this case as per allegation in FIR, Sami Hasnain was 
murdered due to firing by the petitioner in the presence of 
witnesses. Occurrence took place on 28.05.2023, accused claimed 
his date of birth as 11.11.2005. Learned trial Court while 
summoning record of police, NADRA and School along with 
witnesses, conducted a thorough inquiry and it was found that 
police has not mentioned the age of accused in police case diary on 
his arrest and kept it blank and accused also did not raise plea of 
juvenility throughout investigation. Birth certificate of the 
petitioner was obtained on the basis of civil suit filed after the 
occurrence. Earlier Form “B” obtained in year 2019 was not based 
on any authentic document and school leaving certificate was also 
having volunteer entry of date of birth without any proof. Learned 
trial Court had no other choice except to call for a medical 
examination report as required by Section-8 ibid. Report duly 

7 
Crl. Revision No. 56647 of 2024. 
 
signed by five specialist doctors reflects age of petitioner as 21-22 
years even above the grace margin of 1-2 years. Learned trial Court 
while rejecting documents tendered by the petitioner opted to rely 
on medical report, thus, has not committed any illegality or 
irregularity so as to warrant any interference by this Court.  
8.     In the light of above discussion, there is no substance in this 
petition therefore, the same is hereby dismissed.
