Shahid 
Tasawar Rao, Advocate.  
 
AHMAD NADEEM ARSHAD, J. Through this 
Regular First Appeal, filed under Section 96 of the Code of 
Civil Procedure, 1908, the appellant called in question the 
judgment and decree dated 23.01.2023, whereby, the learned 
trial Court partially decreed the respondent‟s suit for 
recovery of damages on the basis of malicious prosecution.

The brief but essential facts of this appeal are 
that the plaintiff (herein after referred to as „the respondent) 
instituted 
a 
suit 
on 
26.04.2012 
for 
recovery 
of 
Rs.53,924,500/- as damages for malicious prosecution 
against the defendant (herein after referred to as „the

No.8-Younis-abad 
Tehsil 
Malakwal 
District 
Mandi 
Bahauddin; that he belongs to a respectable family having 
good reputation in the area; that the Government of Punjab 
allotted him land measuring 12 ½ acres under the Punjab 
Government 
Lambardari 
Scheme 
vide 
order 
dated 
20.03.2009 of District Officer (Revenue) Mandi Bahauddin; 
that the appellant has political rivalry who without any 
reason only to tease and blackmail him preferred an appeal

before Executive District Officer (Revenue) Mandi 
Bahauddin for the cancellation of above said allotted land 
which was dismissed on 24.04.2010 due to non-prosecution; 
that the said appeal was restored but again dismissed on 
merits vide order dated 20.07.2010; that the appellant filed a 
revision petition before Member Board of Revenue Punjab 
Lahore wherein matter was remanded vide order dated 
27.04.2011; that he filed a Review Petition against the said 
order which was allowed vide order dated 28.09.2011; that 
the appellant initiated all these proceedings i.e. preferring of 
appeal as well as revision petitions against the respondent 
dishonestly, with malafide intention as well as due to mal-
practices; that he has to suffer mental and physical torture 
and spent a huge amount in shape of engaging counsel to 
defend the said litigations; that he also suffer loss to his 
agricultural crops and his reputation was also badly effected 
in the area, so he is entitled to recover Rs.88,500/- as fee of 
counsel, 
travelling 
expenses 
Rs.131,000/-, 
mental 
retardation and damages to reputation Rs.5,00,00,000/-, loss 
of crops Rs.37,05,000/- total Rs.53,924,500/- as damages for 
malicious prosecution. 
In response, the appellant appeared before the learned 
trial Court and filed contesting written statement on 
13.03.2015 by raising preliminary objections such as the 
respondent has no cause of action to institute the suit; that he 
has not come to the Court with clean hands; that the 
ingredients of defamation are missing, so the suit is liable to 
be dismissed; that the suit is false and was instituted only to 
harass and black mail him, so the same is liable to be 
dismissed with special costs. While replying on facts it was 
submitted that the land was wrongly allotted to the 
respondent because the land was reserved for “Charagah” 
which cannot be allotted to the respondent under 
Lambardari scheme; that there was no political grudge and

he initiated the proceedings with bonafide intention for the 
welfare of the peoples of the area and to protect the State 
land. He prayed for dismissal of the suit with cost. 
3.

learned trail Court vide order dated 08.04.2016 framed 
following issues.

Relief. 
 
  
The parties were invited to produce their respective 
evidence. The respondent himself appeared as PW-1 and 
also got examined Muhammad Zafar as PW-2 and Noor 
Ahmad as PW-3. The respondent also brought on record 26 
documents as Exh.P-1 to Exh.P-24, Exh.P-24/1 and Exh.P-
25 including 07 documents as Mark-P.1 to Mark-P.7. In

produced only one document as Exh.D-1. Upon conclusion 
of the trial and after providing opportunity of hearing the 
learned trial Court partially decreed the suit vide judgment 
and decree dated 31.05.2016  and awarded Rs.75000/- to the 
respondent as damages for malicious prosecution. Being

vide order dated 02.02.2022 with the concurrence of the 
parties set aside the judgment and decree dated 31.05.2016 
and the matter was remanded to the learned trial Court for its 
decision afresh. After remand, the learned trial Court, while

of damages faced by him due to this litigation. During cross 
examination he admitted that the appellant was also a land-

5
owner. He also admitted that except the appellant another 
person also moved an application to the effect that the land 
was wrongly allotted to him. He admitted that writ petition 
of other objectors is pending before Hon‟ble High Court. He 
also admitted that the possession of the said land was not 
delivered to him; however, voluntary said that on 
28.05.2014 the possession was given to him. He further 
admitted that the possession was withdrawn vide order of 
the DCO dated 04.06.2014. He denied the suggestion that 
due to said litigation he has not suffered any loss. The 
respondent also got examined Muhammad Zafar son of Ata 
Muhammad as PW-2. He also deposed in line with the 
respondent. During cross examination he admitted that the 
respondent has not participated in any election. He further 
admitted that the appellant is also resident of Chak No.8. He 
denied the suggestion that the appellant initiated the 
proceedings against the respondent honestly. He admitted 
that the possession was withdrawn by the order of D.C.O. 
Noor Ahmad son of Ghulam Muhammad appeared as PW-3. 
He also corroborated the statements of PW-1 & PW-2. 
However, during cross examination he admitted that the 
appellant is also gentleman. He showed his ignorance that 
many other persons also moved application against the 
respondent which are pending before Hon‟ble High Court.  
6. 
 
In rebuttal, Asghar Ali appellant appeared as 
DW-1 and deposed that he has no political rivalry against 
the respondent; that he moved the appeal upon the asking 
the inhabitants of the locality only for the welfare of the 
peoples and protection of state land; that due to this 
litigation the respondent has not suffered any loss; that the 
land allotted to the respondent is a “Charagah”; that he 
moved the application against the respondent honestly 
without any ill will or motive; that one Ghulam Muhammad 
also initiated proceedings against the respondent. During 

Regular First Appeal No.28132 of 2023. 
6
cross examination he admitted that the respondent is 
lambardar of Chak No.8 and Chak Doddan. He admitted 
that the land measuring 12 ½ acres was allotted to the 
respondent but possession was not given. He also deposed 
that the land in disputed was reserved for common 
“Charagah”. He admitted that he also moved an application 
for his appointment as lambardar. He further admitted that 
he has no link with the land allotted to the respondent rather 
the same is in the welfare of the inhabitants of the area. He 
denied the suggestion that he has any political rivalry with 
the respondent. He also denied the suggestion that the 
respondent faced any loss with regard to his health, crops or 
reputation due to said litigation. 
7. 
 
The suit in hand was instituted by the 
respondent seeking recovery of Rs.53,924,500/- on account 
of malicious prosecution. In the case of “MUHAMMAD 
AKRAM versus FARMAN BIBI” (PLD 1990 Supreme 
Court 28), the august Supreme Court of Pakistan has laid 
down certain principles for the grant or refusal of damages 
on account of malicious prosecution. The first two of these 
conditions are required for the issue of maintainability 
whereas the remaining are to be proved for success and the 
said conditions must exist conjointly. These conditions are 
as under: - 
(i)  
that the plaintiff was prosecuted by the defendant; 
(ii) 
that the prosecution ended in plaintiff‟s favour; 
(iii) 
that the defendant acted without reasonable and 
probable cause; 
(iv)  
that the defendant was actuated by malice; 
(v) 
that the proceedings had interfered with plaintiff‟s 
liberty and had also affected his reputation and finally 
(vi) 
that the plaintiff had suffered damage. 
 
This precedent has further been reiterated invariably 
in case of “NIAZ and others versus ABDUL SATTAR and 
others” (PLD 2006 Supreme Court 432). 

Regular First Appeal No.28132 of 2023.

In order to comprehend the concept of 
malicious prosecution, it would be appropriate to go behind 
its meaning and definition. The term „malicious prosecution‟ 
is defined in the 11th Edition of Black‟s Law Dictionary in 
the following manner: - 
“The institution of a criminal or civil proceeding for 
an improper purpose and without probable cause. The 
tort requires proof of four element‟s (1) the initiation 
or continuation of a lawsuit; (2) lack of probable 
cause for the lawsuits‟ initiation; (3) malice; and (4) 
favourable termination of the original lawsuit.  
 
A judicial proceeding, instituted by one person against 
another from wrongful or improper motives, and 
without probable cause to sustain it. It is usually 
called a malicious prosecution; and an action for 
damages for being subjected to such a suit is called an 
action for malicious prosecution. In strictness, the 
prosecution might be malicious, that is, brought from 
lawful motives, although founded on good cause. But it 
is well established that unless want of probable cause 
and malice occur no damages are recoverable. 
However, blameworthy was the prosecutor‟s motives, 
he cannot be cast in damages if there was probable 
cause for the complaint he made. Hence, the term 
usually imports a causeless as well as an ill intended 
prosecution. It commonly, but not necessarily, means a 
prosecution on some charge of crime.” 
 
In a case reported as “Muhammad Yousaf v. Abdul 
Qayyum” (PLD 2016 SC 478), the apex Court of the 
country has defined that “Malicious Prosecution” is a tort 
which provides redress to those who have been prosecuted 
“without reasonable cause” and with „malice‟. Malicious 
prosecution is an action instituted with intention of injuring 
the other and without probable cause. 
The Division Bench of this Court in a case “Ghulam 
Hussain and another vs. Muhammad Rafique & 06 others” 
(2015 
MLD 
1583) 
while 
interpreting 
“Malicious 
Prosecution” observed that “Malicious Prosecution” is the 
malicious institution of unsuccessful criminal proceedings 
against another without reasonable or probable cause. This 
tort balances competing principles, namely freedom that 

Regular First Appeal No.28132 of 2023. 
8
every person should have in bringing criminals to justice and 
the need for restraining false accusations against innocent 
persons. Malicious prosecution is an abuse of the process of 
the court by wrongfully setting the law in motion on a 
criminal charge. 
No doubt every person in the society has a right to set 
in motion Governmental and Judicial machinery for 
protection of his rights, but such person should not infringe 
the corresponding rights of others by instituting improper 
legal proceedings in order to harass them by unjustifiable 
litigation. Meaning thereby the institution of a criminal or 
civil proceeding for an improper purpose and without 
probable cause is not justifiable. 
9. 
 
The person who claimed for compensation on 
account of malicious prosecution must also establish the 
connection between the reasonable and probable cause and 
the malice. For the purposes of bringing a claim for 
malicious prosecution the requirements of “absence of 
reasonable and probable cause” and „malice‟ were separate 
requirements although they may be entwined. The proof of 
absence of „reasonable and probable cause‟ must co-exist 
alongside „malice‟. It is commonplace that in order to 
succeed in an action for malicious prosecution the plaintiff 
must prove both that the defendant was activated by malice 
and that he had no reasonable and probable cause for 
prosecution. It is also by now a settled law that every 
prosecution/inquiry which ends in the clearing of opponent 
will not per-se entitle the opponent to file a suit for 
compensation. Successful proceedings initiated under this 
law required that the original proceedings must have been 
malicious and without cause. 
In a case titled “Subedar (Retd) Fazle Rahim v. Rab 
Nawaz” (1999 SCMR 700) the Hon‟ble Supreme Court 
observed as under:- 

Regular First Appeal No.28132 of 2023. 
9
“Mere fact that prosecution instituted by the defendant 
against the plaintiff ultimately failed cannot expose the 
former to the charge of malicious prosecution unless it 
is proved by the plaintiff that the prosecution was 
instituted without any reasonable and probable cause 
and it was due to malicious intention of the defendant 
and not with a mere intention of carrying the law into 
effect.” 
 
10. 
 
“Reasonable and Probable cause” means an 
honest belief in the guilt of the accused based on a full 
conviction founded upon reasonable grounds, of the 
existence of circumstances, which assuming them to be true, 
would reasonably lead any ordinary prudent man and 
cautious man placed in the position of the accuser to the 
conclusion that such person charged was probably guilty of 
the crime imputed. As laid down in Hicks v. Faulkner (1878) 
8 QBD 167 and there must be: -- 
(i) 
An honest belief of the accuser in the guilt of 
the accused; 
(ii) 
Such belief must be based on an honest 
conviction of the existence of the circumstances 
which led the accuser; 
(iii) 
Such secondly mentioned belief as to existence 
of the circumstances must be based upon 
reasonable grounds that is such grounds, as 
would lead any fairly cautious man in the 
defendant‟s situation to belief so; 
(iv) 
The circumstances so believed and relied on by 
the accused must be such as amount to a 
reasonable ground for belief in the guilt of the 
accused. 
 
The element of probable and reasonable cause has 
been defined in case titled “Province of West Bangal and 
others v. S.M. Faruque and others” (PLD 1959 Dacca 268) 
in the following words:- 

Regular First Appeal No.28132 of 2023. 
10
“The law on the subject is well-settled. It is stated in 
Clerk and Lindsel on Torts, 9th Edition, p.662, that an 
individual should not be harassed by legal proceedings 
improperly instituted against him. It is the right of 
every one to put the law in motion if he does so with 
the honest intention of protecting his own or public 
interest. But it is an abuse of that right to proceed 
maliciously and without reasonable and probable 
cause for anticipating success. Hence, the question is: 
What is meant by “reasonable and probable cause”. 
“Reasonable and probable cause” means a genuine 
belief based on reasonable grounds that the 
proceedings are justified.” 
 
11. 
 
The term „malice‟ has been elaborated and 
defined in the authoritative judgment report as “Abdul 
Rasheed v. State Bank of Pakistan” (PLD 1970 Karachi 
344). The operative Para No.7 is relevant and for ready 
reference is reproduced hereunder: - 
“7. The term “malice”, in a prosecution of the nature 
which is before me, has been held not to be spite or 
hatred against an individual but the „malus animus‟ 
and as denoting the working of improper and indirect 
motives. The proper motive for a prosecution is the 
desire to secure the ends of justice. It should, therefore, 
be shown that the prosecution was not actuated by this 
desire but by his personal feelings-See Mitchell v. 
Jenkins ((1833) 5 B & Ad 588); Pike v. Waldrum 
((1352 1 Lloyd‟s Rep.431) and Stevens v. Midland 
Counties Ry. ((1854 10 Ex.352). Further, malice 
should be proved by the plaintiff affirmatively:- Abrath 
v. N.A.Ry. ((1886) 11 A.C.247). Malice may sometime 
be inferred from absence of reasonable and probable 
cause, but this rule has no general application and 
there may be cases where it would be appropriate not 
to infer malice from unreasonableness. Further, if 
reasonable and probable cause is proved, the question 
of malice becomes irrelevant, and also defects of want 
of reasonable and probable cause cannot be supplied 
by evidence of malice-See Turner v. Ambler ((1847 10 
Q B 352); Mitchell v. Jenkins; Brown v. Hawkes 
((1891) 2 Q B 718) and Herniman v. Smith ((1938) 
A.C 305). It would be proper here to quote the 
following observations of Denning. L.J. (as he then 
was) in Tempest v. Snowden ((1952) 1 K B 130) “Even 
though a prosecutor is actuated by the most express 
malice, nevertheless he is not liable so long as there 
was 
reasonable 
and 
probable 
cause 
for 
the 
prosecution.” The same rule has been applied by the 
courts in India and Pakistan. Several decisions on this 
point were brought to my notice by Mr. Fazeel. The 

Regular First Appeal No.28132 of 2023. 
11
first case on this point is the decision of the High 
Court, Lahore in Abdul Shakoor vs. Lipton & CO. 
(AIR 1924 Lah.1) where it was held that in suits for 
malicious prosecution, proof of the existence of malice 
itself is not sufficient but should be accompanied by 
proof of absence of reasonable and probable cause. 
The Lahore High Court reiterated this view in Nur 
Khan v. Jiwandas (AIR 1927 Lah. 120) and Gobind 
Ram v. Kaju Ram (Air 1939 Lah. 504). The same view 
prevailed with the High Court of Madras in V.t. 
Srinivasa Thathachariar v. P. Thiruvenkatachariar 
(AIR 1932 Mad 601). This view also found approval of 
the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 
Balbhaddar Sing v. Badri Sah (AIR 1926 PC 46) and 
in Raja Braid Sunder Deb and others v. Bamdeb Das 
and others (AIR 1944 PC 1) in which last case it was 
further observed that malice cannot be inferred from 
the anger of the persecutor.” 
 
In other words “Malice” means the presence of some 
improper and wrongful motive that is to say, some motive 
other than desire to bring to justice a person whom the 
prosecutor honestly believes to be guilty. 
 
 
 
 
12. 
 
The existence of malicious itself is not 
sufficient to prove malicious prosecution but should be 
accompanied by proof of absence of reasonable and 
probable cause and the malice should be proved 
affirmatively. In a case title “ABDUL RAUF v. ABDUL 
RAZZAK and another” (PLD 1994 Supreme Court 476) it 
was held as under: - 
“It is necessary that the malice should be proved 
affirmatively”. 
 
 
13. 
 
In the instant case admittedly the appellant 
preferred an appeal against the respondent contending 
therein that the land measuring 12 ½ acres allotted to the 
respondent under Lambardari grant is a wrong allotment 
because the same land is reserved for “Charagah” and not 
available for any permanent allotment. Though his appeal as 
well as revision petition were dismissed but vide order dated 
02.06.2014 passed by the District Collector, Mandi 
Bahauddin the land allotted to the respondent under 

Regular First Appeal No.28132 of 2023. 
12
Lambardari Scheme was cancelled on the ground that the 
land in dispute was not included in any scheduled land, so 
the land being a „Charagah‟ was not liable to be allotted to 
any person. It was further mentioned in the said order that 
the possession given to the lambardar was also illegal, so 
the District Collector directed the Assistant Collector, 
Malakwal to obtained vacant possession of the land which 
was vacated/released and in this regard Rapt No. 374 dated 
05.06.2014 was entered in the register of Rapt Roznamcha 
Waqiati.  
14. 
 
It is also pertinent to mention here that the 
respondent assailed the order of District Collector dated 
02.06.2014 in Constitutional Petition bearing No.17614 of 
2014 titled “Muhammad Asghar versus District Collector 
Mandi Bahauddin etc.” In the said case it was reported that 
the department has already resumed the state land on 
02.06.2014 and entire proceedings under Section 32 & 34 of 
the Colonization of Government Lands Act, 1912 have been 
completed and since 02.06.2014 the possession of the suit 
land is with the Government, therefore, the said 
Constitutional 
Petition 
was 
dismissed 
being 
not 
maintainable vide order of this Court dated 07.04.2017. 
15. 
 
It is pertinent to mention here that from perusal 
of different Notifications issued by the Revenue hierarchy 
from time to time it is obvious that the „Charagah‟ lands 
have expressly been excluded from every grant, hence, its 
any alienation or grant of proprietary rights thereof are not 
inconsonance with the policy. Moreover, it is also an 
admitted fact that the „Charagah‟ land cannot be converted 
into state land for its onward allotment against any sort of 
claim and shall not be used for any other purpose except 
with the prior permission of the Board of Revenue. Change 
of character of the „Charagah‟ land was subservient to the 

Regular First Appeal No.28132 of 2023. 
13
manifestly described wider scope of public purpose. 
Admittedly the Charagah land was allotted to the 
respondent 
under 
Notification 
dated 
17.01.2006 
& 
22.10.2007 against Lambardari Grants without changing its 
status and describing the public purposes. From perusal of 
notification 
dated 
17.01.2006 
shows 
that 
against 
Lambardari Grants the Colony Department has shown its 
willing to grant the state land on lease free of charge in the 
colony Districts in the Punjab alongwith other incentives, 
whereas, „Charagah Land‟ does not fall under the state land 
amenable to any allotment under the above said notification 
rather the same is beyond the jurisdiction of the subordinate 
hierarchy of Board of Revenue. Moreover, under Temporary 
Cultivation Lease Scheme and other Schemes, the 
„Charagah‟ land is expressly excluded from every grant of 
allotment, so the order for allotment of „Charagah‟ land 
passed by the District Officer (Revenue) Mandi Bahauddin 
was illegal and against the polices and also against the 
intention of the legislators who have formulated „Charagah‟ 
policy for the welfare of the public-at-large as well as the 
residents of the village. As the District Collector Mandi 
Bahauddin was not competent to allot Charagah‟s land 
under the policy without obtaining permission from the 
Board of Revenue, so, the order for allotment of land to the 
respondent under Lambardari grant is without lawful 
authority and was rightly cancelled and it is also very much 
clear that the appellant has rightly pointed out regarding 
wrong allotment of land to the respondent under Lambardari 
grant and his act was without any malice. In these 
circumstances, the appellant filed the appeal with a 
reasonable and probable cause and the proceedings initiated 
against the respondent is without any malice.  
16. 
 
Moreover, the respondent failed to produce on 
record any medical prescription showing that he suffered any 

Regular First Appeal No.28132 of 2023. 
14
mental or physical torture due to above said litigation. He has 
also failed to bring on record any documents showing that he 
has spent a huge amount upon the litigation as expenses and 
that his reputation was damaged badly. Moreover, the 
respondent has not brought on record any proof with regard to 
his previous political rivalry with the appellant. Rather he 
himself knowingly got allotted the land of Charagah under the 
Lambardari scheme in connivance with the revenue officials.  
17. 
 
It is matter of record that on 27.05.2016 learned 
counsel for the respondent got recorded his statement without 
oath and exhibited documents i.e. Exh.P-1 to Exh.P-25 as well 
as seven documents as Mark-P-1 to Mark-P.7. The respondent 
brought on record the documents through the statement of his 
learned counsel, which has no value in the eye of law because 
mere exhibition of the same is not required rather the same has 
to be proved and brought on record either by the parties 
themselves in their depositions on oath or through any of their 
witness while appearing in the witness box so as to have been 
subject to cross examination. Submission of such documents 
through statement of learned counsel without oath cannot be 
appreciated and cannot be considered in evidence. Reliance is 
placed on “Manzoor Hussain (deceased) through L.Rs., vs. 
Misri Khan” (PLD 2020 Supreme Court 749) and “Mst. 
AKHTAR SULTANA v. Major Retd. MUZAFFAR KHAN 
MALIK through his legal heirs and others” (PLD 2021 
Supreme Court 715), wherein it has been held that:- 
“35. Keeping in view the factual position as to the 
absence of the requisite certificate on the said 
certificate on the said certified copies of the foreign 
documents and their production in evidence in 
statement of the counsel without providing an 
opportunity 
to 
the 
respondents 
to 
test 
their 
authenticity, it would be safe to conclude that the 
alleged certified copies of the foreign document 
tendered in evidence did not cross the legal threshold 
of “admissibility” and “proof”, as mandated under 
clause (5) of Article 89 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat.....”

Further reliance in this regard can safely be placed on 
judgment reported as “RUSTAM and others v. JEHANGIR 
(DECEASED) through L.Rs.” (2023 SCMR 730), wherein it 
has been held as under: - 
“As regards the other two documents i.e. mutation 
No.1836 (Exh.D-9) and mutation No.1837 (Exh.D-8), 
it is suffice to say that according to principle settled by 
this court in the cases reported as Mst. Hameeda 
Begum and others v. Mst. Irshad Begum and others 
(2007 SCMR 996), Federation of Pakistan through 
Secretary Ministry of Defence and another v. Jaffar 
Khan and others (PLD 2010 SC 604) and Province of 
the Punjab through Collector, Sheikhupura and others 
v. Syed Ghazanfar Ali Shah and others (2017 SCMR 
172) the document should be produced in the evidence 
by the party itself and a fair opportunity should be 
given to the opposite party to cross-examination the 
same, as such, the said two documents produced by 
the defendants counsel in his statement could not be 
taken into consideration.”

It is evident from scanning the whole record of 
the case that basic ingredients to establish and prove a case for 
recovery of an amount as damages for malicious prosecution 
are not established in the instant case, and in absence of said 
ingredients the suit of the respondent cannot be decreed in his 
favour as in the instant case the matter with regard to wrong 
allotment under the Lambardari scheme was pointed out by 
the appellant which was duly proved and as a consequence the 
allotment of the respondent under the said scheme was 
cancelled as the land was not reserved for allotment rather the 
same was reserved/declared as „Charagah‟ which was not 
available for allotment.  
19. 
 
Since, the act of the appellant is proved as 
without any malice, so the respondent is not entitled to any 
damages on the basis of malicious prosecution because the 
prosecution was not based on malice rather the same was 
based on true facts.  The revenue hierarchy also initiated 
proceedings against the delinquents officials involved in the 
said allotment in the name of the respondent.

20. 
    
In the light of above discussion it is very much 
clear that the learned trial Court has erred in law while 
deciding issue No.1 partially in favour of the respondent 
because it is proved that he got allotted the land reserved for 
„Charagah‟ dishonestly and this fact was rightly disclosed 
by the appellant and the land was resumed by the Revenue 
hierarchy, so the respondent is not entitled to any damages 
on malicious prosecution. Since the main issues is decided 
against the respondent-plaintiff, therefore, there is no need 
to discuss and decide the remaining issues, hence, the same 
are become redundant. 
21. 
     
Epitome of above discussion is that the instant 
appeal is allowed and consequently the impugned judgment 
and decree dated 23.01.2023 is set aside. Resultantly, the 
suit of the respondent for the recovery of Rs.53,924,500/- on 
the basis of malicious prosecution is without any merits, 
hence, the same is dismissed. Parties are left to bear their 
own costs.
