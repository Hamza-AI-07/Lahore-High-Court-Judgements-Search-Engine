Petitioners as per the latest approach of Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
curtailing the litigation in Pakistan by adopting pro mediation bias and 
new principles settled by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in holding 
that a show cause notice can also be viewed as being akin to alternate 
dispute resolution as mentioned in detailed recent judgment of this 
Court in STRATEGIC PLANS DIVISION and another Versus 
PUNJAB REVENUE AUTHORITY and others (PLD 2024 Lahore 
545). 
I. 
FACTS OF THE CASE 
3.  
M/s Sadiq Poultry (Private) Limited and M/s Islamabad Feeds 
(Private) Limited (hereinafter to be referred as the “Petitioners”) are 
engaged in running the businesses of poultry proceeds. They were 
issued the “impugned notices” by the “CCP” under Section 30 of the 
“Act” based on an inquiry report dated 21.05.2021 which according 
to the “Petitioners” is actually stemming from social media, pursuant 
thereto the “CCP” took cognizance of the matter by first initiating an 
inquiry, without hearing the “Petitioners” which thereafter resulted 
into issuance of the “impugned notices”.  
II. 
PETITIONERS’ SUBMISSIONS 
4. 
Mr. Taimoor Aslam Khan, ASC for the “Petitioners” argued 
that the “CCP” published a press release dated 09.12.2021 on its 
website and pursuant thereto charge sheeted and declared the 
“Petitioners” guilty for forming a cartel in the ex parte enquiry report 
dated 06.12.2021 (the “enquiry report”) without affording 
opportunity of hearing. He next argued that the “CCP” finalized the 
“enquiry report” without seeking comments and confronting 
allegations leveled therein and has issued the “impugned notices” 
under Section 30 of the “Act”. Mr. Uzair Shafie, Advocate stated that 
the “CCP” has carried out a fishing and roving enquiry by making the 
allegations in relation to eggs and broiler chicken which were not the 
subject matter of the “enquiry report” and thus is not in consonance 
with the scope of enquiry in terms of Section 37 of the “Act”. 
Barrister Jahanzeb Awan, Advocate adds that though enquiry under 

W.P.No.498 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3 
W.P.No.1633 of 2024 
Section 32(1) of the “Act” can be initiated by the “CCP” yet such 
discretion/powers cannot be exercised in an arbitrary manner. Mr. 
Arshad Mahmood, Advocate pointed out that the “CCP” may gather 
sufficient facts or prima facie evidence on the basis of a study 
conducted under Section 37(3) of the “Act” and then initiate an 
inquiry on its own however, the “CCP” has given incorrect and 
erroneous findings in the “enquiry report” and make it public without 
affording the “Petitioners” to confront the allegations.  
III. 
RESPONDENTS’ SUBMISSIONS 
5. 
Barrister 
Asadullah 
Chattha, 
Advocate 
for 
the 
Respondents/CCP has objected to maintainability of these petitions 
against the “impugned notices” and inter alia stated that the 
“impugned notices” have been duly issued by the “CCP” under 
Section 30 of the “Act” after fulfilling all procedural requirements; 
that the “CCP” is fully authorized, entitled and permitted to conduct 
enquiries in cases of contravention of Chapter-II of the “Act” and sole 
purpose of Section 30 of the “Act” is to get the reply back with 
reasonable cause as to why an order under Section 31 and 38 should 
not be taken against the “Petitioners” for contravention of Section 3 
and 4 of the “Act”. Hafiz Naseem and Ambreen Abbasi, Senior Legal 
Advisors for the “CCP” added that the “Petitioners” were provided 
opportunity of hearing however, they willfully avoided such 
opportunity and that alternate remedies under Section 41 to 44 of the 
“Act” are available to the “Petitioners” when proceedings under 
Section 30 of the “Act” culminates into penal consequences in terms 
of Section 31 and 38 of the “Act”. Barrister Asadullah Chattha, 
Advocate stated that enquiry report is just a fact finding exercise and 
hearing of parties is not required for its conclusion whereas the show 
cause notice proceedings cannot be concluded without providing 
opportunity of hearing to the parties  and if it is assumed that full 
satisfaction is required at the time of issuance of show cause notice 
then the whole process of proceedings, opportunity of hearing and 

W.P.No.498 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4 
W.P.No.1633 of 2024 
recording of evidence become meaningless which, is not the intention 
or spirit of the legislation.  
IV. 
DETERMINATION 
6. 
The sole grievance of the “Petitioners” is that the “enquiry 
report” was finalized ex parte without affording opportunity of 
hearing and pursuant thereto, the “impugned notices” were issued by 
the “CCP” exercising powers in arbitrary manner and without 
gathering sufficient facts or prima facie evidence. While on the other 
hand, learned counsel for the Respondents stated that the “impugned 
notices” were duly issued by the “CCP” under Section 30 of the 
“Act” after fulfilling all procedural requirements and that too after 
providing an opportunity of hearing to the “Petitioners” to appear and 
defend their stance, however, they willfully avoided to appear before 
the “CCP”. This Court will examine certain provisions of the “Act” 
preamble of which provides for free competition in all spheres of 
commercial and economic activity to enhance economic efficiency 
and to protect consumers from anti competitive behaviour. The 
competition law is also known as antitrust law that regulates the 
conduct and organization of businesses in order to promote 
competition and prevent unjustified monopolies. In this case, the 
“CCP” issued the “impugned notices” under Section 30 of the “Act” 
mentioning that the “CCP” initiated inquiry under Section 37 of the 
“Act” on 21.05.2021 into possible anti-competitive activities in the 
poultry sector that was concluded on 06.12.2021 and the 
“Petitioners” were called upon to appear and place facts and material 
in their support failing which order under Section 31 of the “Act” 
might be passed against them. 
a. 
Legal Pathology of Section 30 of the “Act” 
7. 
Chapter-IV of the “Act” deals with the powers and functions 
of the “CCP”. Section 28 of the “Act” empowers the “CCP” to 
initiate proceedings against the individuals and undertakings 
committing contravention or non-compliance of the provisions of the 
“Act”. While Section 30 of the “Act” authorizes the “CCP” to pass 

W.P.No.498 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5 
W.P.No.1633 of 2024 
orders in case of breach and violation of Chapter-II and prior to 
passing any order, a notice highlighting the specific reasons for 
initiating proceedings coupled with providing an opportunity of 
hearing is also mandated. In addition, thereto, the “CCP” is also 
empowered under Section 37 of the “Act” to conduct enquiries and 
studies on matters relevant to the provisions of the “Act”. 
8. 
It is observed that Section 30 (1) and (2) of the “Act” is 
perimetria to Section 16 of the Punjab Environment Protection Act, 
1997 wherein the Authority, Commission or Agency has to be 
satisfied itself for contravention of provision of the Act before making 
any proceedings in the case but such satisfaction cannot be done 
unless sub-section 30(2) of the “Act” is invoked and thus it has to be 
read first as the “CCP” has to give notice of intention to make order 
and to give undertaking an opportunity to be heard the parties in 
details. Section 30(2) of the “Act” then comes into play with the 
notice issued by the “CCP” with its intention to make orders stating 
reasons to the undertaking of contravention with some material which 
the “CCP” based it on certain material it has then just to sit with the 
Respondents and clarify whether there is any contravention of the 
provision of the “Act” and such notice issued under this section has to 
be read with Section 37(4) of the “Act” as per enquiry initiated under 
Section 37 of the “Act” which has already been done by the “CCP” 
in this case. The language of Section 30(2) of the “Act” is very clear 
which states that the “CCP” firstly shall serve notice of its intention 
stating reasons to the undertaking and by giving an opportunity of 
being heard with supportive material whereas as per proviso to 
Section 30(2), the “CCP” can decide the case ex parte in case the 
undertaking does not avail the opportunity of being heard.  
9. 
From the perusal of the “Act”, it is evident that Section 28 of 
the “Act” delineates the functions and powers of the “CCP”, 
empowering it to initiate ‘proceedings’ in accordance with the 
procedures of the “Act”. This section explicitly states that the “CCP” 
may conduct enquiries into the affairs of any undertaking as may be 

W.P.No.498 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6 
W.P.No.1633 of 2024 
necessary for the purposes of the “Act”. This broad mandate 
underscores the CCP's role as a proactive regulator, capable of 
initiating investigations to promote competition and prevent anti-
competitive behavior. Section 30(1) of the “Act” empowers the 
“CCP” to make orders in cases of contravention of the provisions of 
Chapter II. It mandates that the “CCP” must adopt due process by 
providing notice of its intention to make such an order, thereby 
ensuring that the undertaking has an opportunity to be heard. This 
procedural safeguard is essential for maintaining fairness and 
transparency in the regulatory process. However, it is crucial to note 
that the initiation of an enquiry under Section 37 does not equate to a 
formal proceeding under Section 30 of the “Act”, as the latter 
involves potential penal consequences. Section 37 of the “Act” is 
particularly pertinent to the CCP's authority to conduct enquiries. Sub-
section (1) empowers the CCP to initiate enquiries on its own or upon 
a reference from the Federal Government. This provision is 
significant as it allows the “CCP” to act independently, without 
waiting for a complaint or external prompting. The Supreme Court of 
Pakistan, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
DALDA 
FOODS 
LIMITED 
V. 
COMPETITION COMMISSION OF PAKISTAN (2023 SCMR 1991) 
expounded the scope and powers of the “CCP” under Section 37 of 
the “Act”. The Court held that enquiries and studies are independent 
tools employed by the “CCP” to collect and assess information on 
market trends. Importantly, the Court emphasized that such enquiries 
do not constitute an adverse action or a formal proceeding under 
Section 30 of the “Act”. The relevant portion of the judgment read as 
under:- 
“Section 37 of the Act provides for enquiry and 
studies and subsection (1) thereof provides that the 
CCP may, on its own, conduct enquiries and studies 
into any matter relevant to the purposes of this Act -
-- Therefore, in terms of sections 36 and 37 the 
power to call for information or conducting an 
enquiry or study do not constitute a proceeding 
against an undertaking under section 30 of the Act. 

W.P.No.498 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7 
W.P.No.1633 of 2024 
It is important to draw a distinction between section 
30” 
 
  
Likewise, the Supreme Court in A. RAHIM FOODS (PVT) 
LIMITED COMPETITION COMMISSION OF PAKISTAN VERSUS 
K&N’S FOODS (PVT) LIMITED and others (PLD 2023 SC 516) also 
noted that the “CCP” can initiate inquiries on its own accord under 
Section 37(1) of the “Act”, which allows it to address potential 
violations proactively. These judicial interpretations unequivocally 
affirm the CCP's authority to initiate enquiries based on its own 
assessment of market conditions, thereby enhancing its regulatory 
effectiveness. It leads to the obvious conclusion that the “Act” does 
not pose any embargo upon “CCP” rather it empowers the 
commission to initiate enquiries on its own against any undertaking to 
serve the purposes of the “Act”.  
10. 
So far as the issuance of the “impugned notice” by the “CCP” 
is concerned, the jurisdiction to issue the “impugned notices” by the 
“CCP” has not been agitated. The relevant part of the “impugned 
notices” reads as under: 
“NOW THEREFORE, you, the Undertaking, is 
called upon to show cause in writing within fourteen 
(14) days from the date of receipt of this show cause 
notice and to appear and place before the 
Commission, facts and material in support of the 
contentions and to avail the opportunity of being 
heard through a duly authorized representative on 
February 15, 2022 at the Office of the Commission 
i.e. 8th Floor South, ISE Towers, 55-B, Jinnah 
Avenue, Islamabad at 11:30 a.m. or as soon 
thereafter convenient to the Commission, and to 
explain as to why an appropriate order under 
Section 31 of the Act may not be passed and/or a 
penalty for violating the provisions of the Act may 
not be imposed under Section 38 thereof”.  
 
  
Bare reading of above observation clearly reveals that the 
“Petitioners” have only been called upon to show cause in writing 
and to appear and place before the “CCP”, facts and material in 

W.P.No.498 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8 
W.P.No.1633 of 2024 
support of their contentions and to avail the opportunity of hearing. 
When confronted to learned counsel for the “Petitioners” whether 
they have filed reply to the “impugned notices”, he stated that the 
“CCP” had authorized enquiry in terms of Section 37(1) of the “Act” 
without fulfilling the mandatory prerequisites and it was necessary for 
the “CCP” to provide reasonings which had not been done. Evidently 
the “Petitioners” have knocked the door of this Court to agitate the 
issuance of show cause notice against them within the realm of Article 
199 of the “Constitution”. The Court feel it imperative to discern that 
if this extraordinary jurisdiction can be determinatively applied to the 
situation in hand where the ‘injury’ is not actual rather perceived in 
the form of mere issuance of show cause notice. To begin with the 
literal understanding, the term ‘show cause’ has been defined in 
Black’s Law Dictionary 11th edition, as ‘To produce a satisfactory 
explanation or excuse, usu. In connection with a motion or 
application to a court’. The Supreme Court in COMMISSIONER 
INLAND REVENUE, LAHORE Vs M/S. MILLAT TRACTORS 
LIMITED, LAHORE and others (2024 SCMR 700) has eloquently 
examined, explicated and laid down the meaning and scope of the 
term show cause notice and held that it as a formal communication 
that informs the recipient of alleged legal violations and provides 
them an opportunity to respond, embodying the principles of natural 
justice and due process, which ensure a fair hearing and protection of 
rights before any adverse action is taken. The relevant portion of the 
esteemed judgment read as follows:- 
“A show cause notice is a formal communication 
from an authority, informing the recipient of an 
alleged violation or non-compliance with a law, and 
providing them with an opportunity to respond to 
the said allegations. It embodies the principle of 
natural justice, which requires that parties to a 
dispute be given a fair hearing before any decision 
is made that may affect their rights or interests. The 
principles of due process and fairness mandate that 
the recipient of a show cause notice be given 
adequate time to respond and present their case, 

W.P.No.498 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9 
W.P.No.1633 of 2024 
that they be given access to relevant evidence and 
information, and that they be given the opportunity 
to be heard before any action is taken against them. 
This ensures that the decision-maker is not biased, 
that the decision is based on the facts of the case 
and the relevant law, and that the recipient's rights 
and interests are protected. Thus, in addition to the 
fair hearing principle, there are other principles of 
natural justice that also apply for the purposes of 
issuance of show cause notices, including the 
principle of impartiality, which requires that the 
decisionmaker be impartial, and the principle of 
reasons, which requires that the decision-maker 
provide reasons for their decision.1 Therefore, a 
show cause notice is an important tool for enforcing 
the law, and to ensure that the recipient is given a 
fair and transparent opportunity to present their 
case before any adverse order affecting their rights 
and interests is passed”. 
 
11. 
Similarly, the Supreme Court in COMMISSIONER INLAND 
REVENUE and others Versus JAHANGIR KHAN TAREEN and others 
(2022 SCMR 92) elaborated the concept of show cause notice in the 
following manner:- 
“A show cause notice is delivered to a person by an 
authority in order to get the reply back with a 
reasonable cause as to why a particular action 
should not be taken against him with regard to the 
defaulting act. By and large, it is a well-defined and 
well-structured process to provide the alleged 
defaulter with a fair chance to respond the 
allegation 
and 
explain 
his 
position 
within 
reasonable timeframe”.  
 
12. 
A show cause notice is therefore not a testament of an adverse 
proceeding against a party rather it is an intimation of initiation of a 
process, which requires certain answers and clarifications from the 
party being addressed to. As such a show cause notice is not and 
ought not to be a culmination of unfavorable determination against the 
party but it is, and it must be adopted as a mode of opportunity to 
enable the party to provide explanation of certain facts or missing 
information as required by the relevant law in a case where 

W.P.No.498 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10 
W.P.No.1633 of 2024 
shortcomings or omissions thereof surfaced or noted either through 
the enquiry, tentative or otherwise or by information received to the 
department in any other manner.  
13. 
Now the question arises that against issuance of show cause 
notice whether a constitutional petition under Article 199 of the 
“Constitution” is maintainable or not. The Supreme Court in 
DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX/WEALTH TAX, 
FAISALABAD and others Versus Messrs PUNJAB BEVERAGE 
COMPANY (PVT.) LTD (2008 SCMR 308) has deprecated with 
emphasis the tendency to bypass legal remedies and resort to the 
constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court. The Court noted that the 
“Petitioners” should have responded to the show-cause notice before 
seeking intervention, as this practice undermines the department's 
ability to proceed with cases effectively. The relevant portion read as 
follows:- 
“We have heard learned counsel and have gone 
through the reported judgment carefully wherein it 
has been held that tendency of bypassing the remedy 
provided under law, and resort to constitutional 
jurisdiction of High court was deprecated. In view 
of the contents of the notice the Department only 
contemplates to take action against them. The 
petitioner instead of rushing to the High Court and 
consuming sufficient time should have submitted 
reply before invoking the jurisdiction of the High 
Court. We have held in the judgment that such 
practice is to be deprecated because if merely on the 
basis of show-cause notice proceedings are started 
then in such position department would never be in 
a position to proceed with the cases ---------------   
---- 
Therefore, merely for the purpose of convenience, 
availing the remedy of the High Court under Article 
199 of the Constitution cannot be appreciated”.  
 
  
The Islamabad High Court in SAEED AHMAD AND OTHERS 
VERSUS CHAIRMAN O.G.D.C.L. and others (2020 PLC 27) also 
laid down the same principle while enumerating the grounds, on the 

W.P.No.498 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
11 
W.P.No.1633 of 2024 
basis of which, though, a writ is maintainable in circumstances. The 
relevant portion was read as follows:- 
“It is well settled that mere issuance of a show 
cause notice does not amount to an adverse action. 
Although in the case at hand the N.I.R.C. has 
dismissed the petitioners' petitions against the show 
cause notices issued by O.G.D.C.L., it is also well 
settled that a writ petition against a show-cause 
notice is not maintainable unless such a notice has 
been issued without lawful authority, is wholly 
without jurisdiction, coram non judice or is based 
on mala fides”. 
 
  
This 
Court 
in 
ABDUL 
RAZZAQ 
Versus 
LAHORE 
DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY through Director General and 
another (2017 PLC (C.S.) Note 2) also reiterated the same principle 
in the following manner:- 
“It is settled principal of law that the writ petition is 
not 
maintainable 
against 
show-cause 
notice, 
summons or notice as final order is yet to be passed 
and if any adverse order is passed then the 
petitioner may be at liberty to challenge the same by 
taking all objections/points available to him. I am 
not persuaded to accept the contention of the 
learned counsel for the petitioner that show-cause 
notice, summons or notice may be assailed before 
this Court in Constitutional Jurisdiction. Therefore, 
interference of High Court in the matter is not 
warranted by law”. 
 
14.  
It is thus a well settled principle of law that mere issuance of a 
show cause notice is not an adverse order and writ petition 
thereagainst is not maintainable. This Court in its recent judgment 
STRATEGIC PLANS DIVISION and another versus PUNJAB 
REVENUE AUTHORITY and others (PLD 2024 Lahore 545) has 
conclusively summed up the principles regarding maintainability of 
writ petition against mere issuance of show cause notice. The relevant 
part of holding is reproduced as under:-  
i. 
Show-cause notice is not an adverse order 
unless it could be clearly shown to the 
satisfaction of the Court that it has been issued 

W.P.No.498 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12 
W.P.No.1633 of 2024 
by an authority not vested with jurisdiction or it 
was issued for mala fide reasons. 
ii. 
The exception relating to want of jurisdiction 
does not include every jurisdictional error. A 
wrong exercise of jurisdiction or interpretation 
of the law cannot be treated as want of 
jurisdiction. 
iii. 
Constitutional jurisdiction is exercised if the 
Court is satisfied that the person is an 
'aggrieved party' within the context of Article 
199 of the Constitution and no adequate remedy 
is provided by law. If adequate statutory 
remedies are provided under the relevant 
statute, it is to be taken into consideration while 
exercising discretion under Article 199 of the 
Constitution. 
iv. 
By passing or circumventing statutory forums is 
to be discouraged. 
v. 
The approach should be to advance the object 
and purpose of a statute and every effort made 
to uphold the sanctity of the legislative intent 
rather defeating it. 
 
15. 
Since through the “impugned notices” a chance is given to the 
“Petitioners” to appear and produce evidence/material in response to 
the allegations leveled in the “enquiry report” therefore, the 
“Petitioners” grievance is not actual rather perceived. Moreover, the 
“Petitioners” has not controverted or challenged the authority of the 
“CCP” to issue ‘notice’ so no question of issuance of show cause 
notice without valid jurisdiction arises in any manner for 
maintainability of instant petition. Even otherwise, from the 
jurisprudential aspect, the version of the “Petitioners”, at this juncture, 
is also contradictory to the doctrine of ripeness. This doctrine is also a 
determinative parameter for maintainability and merit adjudication of 
a constitutional petition within the bound of Article 199 of the 
“Constitution”. From the literal standpoint the term ‘ripeness’ has 
been defined in Blacks’Law Dictionary, 11th Edition as ‘The state of 
a dispute that has reached, but has not passed, the point when the 
facts have developed sufficiently to permit an intelligent and useful 
decision to be made. The requirement that this state must exist before 

W.P.No.498 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
13 
W.P.No.1633 of 2024 
a court will decide a controversy’. On the other hand, the term 
‘doctrine of ripeness’ has been defined in Advanced Law Lexicon 4th 
Edition p. 4276 as “A doctrine prohibiting federal Courts from 
exercising jurisdiction over a case until an actual controversy is 
presented involving a threat of injury that is real and immediate”.  
Apart from the dictionary definition, the concept of doctrine of 
ripeness is also the subject of discussion in multiple legal article. One 
of which was published in Chicago Law Journal (Volume No.75) 
under the title “No Time Is the Right Time: The Supreme Court's Use 
of Ripeness to Block Judicial Re o Block Judicial Review of Forrest 
Plans for Environmental  Plans for Environmental” in which the 
author of the article articulated the doctrine of ripeness in the terms 
“ripeness is a doctrine that relates to the timing of judicial review, 
asking if the court is equipped to adjudicate the issues before it. The 
basic rationale of the ripeness doctrine is to prevent the courts through 
avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in 
abstract disagreements over administrative policies, and also to 
protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative 
decision has been formulized and its effects felt in a concrete way by 
the challenging parties”.  
16. 
The principle at hand is grounded in the notion that judicial 
resources must be preserved, ensuring that Courts engage only with 
disputes that are actual and immediate. It reflects the view that Courts 
should concern themselves with tangible, present, or imminent issues, 
avoiding the exhaustion of their efforts on abstract or perceived 
questions layered in probabilities and apprehensions. As such, judicial 
intervention is discouraged in matters that, at least for the time being, 
do not bear a direct or substantial impact on the parties involved. 
Furthermore, 
this 
Court 
in 
MUGHAL-E-AZAM 
BANQUET 
COMPLEX through Managing Partner versus FEDERATION OF 
PAKISTAN through Secretary and 4 others (2011 PTD 2260) made a 
detailed analysis of the doctrine and highlighted its applicability and 
significance while holding that the doctrine of "Ripeness" ensures that 

W.P.No.498 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
14 
W.P.No.1633 of 2024 
Courts avoid premature adjudication by requiring disputes to be 
concrete and focused, preventing abstract disagreements over policies. 
This principle protects agencies from judicial interference until their 
decisions are formalized and felt by the challenging parties, allowing 
courts to benefit from agency expertise and a developed record. The 
relevant portion of the judgment read as under:- 
“Just as a case can be brought too late, ... it can be 
brought too early, and not yet be ripe for 
adjudication ... until the controversy has become 
concrete and focused, it is difficult for the court to 
evaluate the practical merits of the position of each 
party.’ The basic rational behind the ‘Ripeness’ 
doctrine is ‘to prevent the courts through avoidance 
of 
premature 
adjudication, 
from 
entangling 
themselves, 
in 
abstract 
disagreements 
over 
administrative policies, and also to protect the 
agencies from judicial interference until an 
administrative decision has been formalized and its 
effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging 
parties.’ ‘Ripeness’ requires that an issue be 
sufficiently found and felt to be a justifiable 
controversy ... As courts insist on a concrete context, 
that context enables them to better see the problems 
that they are supposed to redress. As courts insist on 
completed agency action, that insistence may (1) 
eliminate the waste of courts deciding disputes that 
might be mooted as an agency runs its course, (2) 
assure the courts of the knowledge gained from 
applied agency expertise, and (3) provide them with 
a record already developed by the agency”. 
 
  
In SABIRA KHATOON versus GOVERNMENT OF THE 
PUNJAB and others (2021 PLC (C.S.) 1600), the Court held that 
“Ripeness is a doctrine which courts use to enforce prudential 
limitations upon their jurisdiction". It is founded on the principle 
that judicial machinery should be conserved. It "reflects concerns 
that courts involve themselves only in problems that are real and 
present or imminent" and should not exhaust themselves in deciding 
theoretical or abstract questions that have no impact on the parties 
at least for the time being. This doctrine postulates that the "lawsuit 
must be well developed and specific and appropriate for judicial

resolution. Courts may not decide cases that involve uncertain and 
contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or 
indeed may not occur at all." In MUHAMMAD HAMMAD UR 
REHMAN ZAFAR versus DIRECTOR, FEDERAL INVESTIGATION 
AGENCY, LAHORE and another (PLD 2022 Lahore 177), the Court 
held that “the doctrine of prematurity and ripeness suggests that a 
matter is not amenable to adjudication in constitutional jurisdiction 
if it is either premature or not ripe for adjudication inasmuch as the 
impugned step or the executive act complained of does not give rise 
to any tangible grievance that can be addressed in law. It may also 
be that the time of challenge coincides with a yet not complete 
intervening process leading up to the final act or that an 
opportunity or chance, besides resort to Constitutional jurisdiction, 
is still available with the litigant”. 
 
b. 
Basic Object and Purpose of CCP Reflected in the 
Preamble of the “Act” 
 
17. 
The basic emphasis was focused on its preamble of the “Act” 
where it has been clearly mentioned that it was made to ensure (i) free 
competition in all spheres of commercial and economic activity; (ii) 
enhance economic efficiency; (iii) protect consumers from anti-
competitive behaviour; (iv) provide for establishment of the “CCP” to 
maintain and enhance competition and for matters connected 
therewith or incidental thereto. The preamble to a statute is though not 
an operational part of the enactment but it is a gateway, which opens 
before us the purpose and intent of the legislature, which necessitated 
the legislation on the subject and also sheds clear light on the goals 
which the legislator aimed to secure through the introduction of such 
law. The preamble of a statute, therefore holds a pivotal role for the 
purposes of interpretation in order to dissect the true purpose and 
intent of the law. The Supreme Court of Pakistan in DIRECTOR 
GENERAL, FIA AND OTHERS Versus KAMRAN IQBAL and others 
(2016 SCMR 447) laid down the similar principle by holding that 

W.P.No.498 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
16 
W.P.No.1633 of 2024 
“indeed, preamble to a Statute is not an operative part thereof, 
however, as is now well laid down that the same provides a useful 
guide for discovering the purpose and intention of the legislature. 
Reliance in this regard may be placed on, the case of Murree Brewery 
Company Limited v. Pakistan through the Secretary of Government of 
Pakistan and others (PLD 1972 SC 279). It is equally well-established 
principle that while interpreting a, Statute a purposive approach 
should be adopted in accord with the objective of the Statute and not 
in derogation to the same”. This Court in DILSONs (Private) Limited 
and others versus SECURITY & EXCHANGE COMMISSION OF 
PAKISTAN and another (2021 CLD 1317 Lahore) has already 
declared the “CCP” as Regulator in Pakistan by holding that “the 
CCP was established under Section 12 of the Competition Act, with 
the intent to ensure free competition and economic efficiency and to 
carry out the administrative function of the executive to promote 
consumer welfare with the sole objective to regulate anti-competitive 
behaviour. Purpose of the CCP is to ensure fair competition by 
regulating the prohibitions set out in Chapter-II of the Competition 
Act. Therefore, it has a regulatory objective to promote free 
competition and prevent anti-competitive behaviour and prescribe 
enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance”. The object of the 
“Act” was elaborated by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in A. RAHIM 
FOODS (PVT.) LIMITED and another versus K&N'S FOODS (PVT.) 
LIMITED and others (2023 CLD 1001) holding that “free and fair 
competition is a fundamental concept in economics that involves 
providing a level playing field for all market participants. It is 
based on the principles of a free market where businesses compete 
on equal terms, and consumers make decisions based on price, 
quality, and preference. Free and fair competition is competition 
that is based on quality, price, and service rather than unfair 
practices. Predatory pricing, competitor bashing, and the abuse of 
monopoly-type powers, for example, are unfair practices. When 
competitors can compete freely on a 'level playing field,' economies 

W.P.No.498 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
17 
W.P.No.1633 of 2024 
are more likely to thrive”. In COMPETITION COMMISSION OF 
PAKISTAN and others versus DALDA FOODS LIMITED, KARACHI 
(2023 SCMR 1991) it has held that “the Act aims to regulate the 
fundamental right to conduct any lawful trade or business 
guaranteed by Article 18 of the Constitution of Pakistan, in the 
interest of free competition as provided in clause (b) of the proviso 
to that Article. As one of the primary objectives of enshrining a 
right within the Constitution is to safeguard it from being 
susceptible to ordinary legislation, the regulatory laws that have 
the effect of impacting a constitutionally guaranteed right are to be 
strictly construed. The wide and liberal interpretation of such laws 
may make the constitutional guarantee redundant. Therefore, the 
provisions of the Act that authorize the Commission, in the  
public interest of ensuring free competition, to interfere in the 
exercise of the fundamental right to conduct any lawful trade or 
business must be strictly construed”. The object of the “Act” was 
further discussed in LPG ASSOCIATION OF PAKISTAN through 
Chairman versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through Secretary, 
Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources, Islamabad and others 
(2021 CLD 214) whereby the Court has held that “the objective of 
the Act is economic welfare and consumer welfare. The Act sets out 
to improve economic efficiency through its regulatory mechanism 
by prohibiting anti-competitive behaviour as it impacts all spheres 
of commercial and economic activity”  
c. 
Legal Anthropology of “CCP” and the Previous Laws. 
18.  
In order to ensure free competition in all spheres of 
commercial and economic activity and to enhance economic 
efficiency and to protect consumers from anti-competitive behaviour, 
the reasons for enacting the “Act” and the establishment of “CCP” 
being the Regulator, has to be seen from its legal anthropology. The 
history of competition law in Pakistan dates back to the 1970s when 
The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices (Control and 
Prevention) Ordinance, 1970 (the “Ordinance of 1970”) was 

W.P.No.498 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
18 
W.P.No.1633 of 2024 
promulgated with the object to provide for measure against 
concentration of economic power, growth of unreasonable monopoly 
power and unreasonably restrictive trade practices. The Competition 
Ordinance, 2007 (the “Ordinance of 2007”) was thereafter 
promulgated preamble of which provides for free competition in all 
sphere of commercial and economic activity to enhance economic 
efficiency and to protect consumers from anti-competitive behaviour. 
The said Ordinance was finally enacted through new legislation 
namely the Competition Commission Act, 2010 preamble whereof is 
identical to that of the “Ordinance of 2007”. This legal anthropology 
has the existence of “CCP” being the Regulator from time to time 
under the various statutes in order to achieve the main goal of 
enhancing economic efficiency and for protection of consumers from 
anti-competitive behaviour.  It is observed that till the time the 
“Ordinance of 1970” remained in field there was only one (1) 
judgment of the Supreme court of Pakistan (PLD 2005 SC 193), 
thirteen (13) of the High Court and six (6) of the Authority under the 
“Ordinance of 1970”. Moreover, under the “Ordinance of 2007” 
there were one twenty-eight (128) judgments passed by the “CCP” 
and its members/Chairman; six (6) judgments were passed by the 
Sindh High Court, four (4) by Islamabad High Court, Islamabad, four 
(4) by Lahore High Court and one (1) by the Competition Appellate 
Tribunal and three (3) judgments by the Supreme Court of Pakistan.  
V. 
CONCLUSION  
19. 
This petition was filed against the “impugned notices” by the 
“Petitioners”, which is not an adverse order and by agitating the same 
against such an injury which is neither actual nor immediate rather 
perceived and suppositious.  The issuance of the “impugned notices” 
is an initial yet primary step of the process to ensure fair opportunity, 
which is also akin to probability of mediation as well pointed out by 
the Supreme Court in COMMISSIONER INLAND REVENUE versus 
Messrs RYK MILLS (2023 SCMR 1856). It is an opportunity for the 
“Petitioners” to explain their position and if they do so, the 

W.P.No.498 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
19 
W.P.No.1633 of 2024 
“impugned notices” are and ought to be deemed satisfied without any 
further adverse action. As the matter has not been ripened under 
Chapter IV of the “Act” under which certain powers have been given 
to the Regulator to decide the matter and once it is decided by the 
“CCP”, the “Petitioners” have the remedies under Section 41 of the 
“Act” by way of an appeal before the Appellant Bench of the 
Commission and appeal to the Competition Appellate Tribunal under 
Section 42 of the “Act” and further appeal to the Supreme Court 
under Section 44 of the “Act”, and such remedies have not been 
exhausted by the “Petitioners”. This Court in CHENAB FLOUR & 
GENERAL MILLS versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN and others 
(PLD 2021 Lahore 343) has held that if a Regulator is barred from 
exercising any of such functions, the purpose of law will not only be 
compromised but the intent behind making of such law will also be 
jeopardized. Moreover, if the Court starts interfering at initial steps of 
the Regulator for not initiating inquiry, then it will create hurdle for 
the Regulator to proceed in the matter to protect the very purpose and 
object of law. It is settled law by now that this Court, before granting 
relief to a Petitioners by exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction under 
Article 199 of the “Constitution”, must satisfy itself regarding the 
non-availability of any alternate remedy, or in case Court is inclined 
to grant relief even in presence of alternate remedy, Court should be 
satisfied that circumstances of the case make the other remedy 
inadequate. While dealing with question of maintainability of a 
petition before this Court, in presence of an alternate efficacious 
remedy available to a litigant, the Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
judgments reported as “INDUS TRADING AND CONTRACTING 
COMPANY Versus COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS (Preventive) 
Karachi and others” (2016 SCMR 842), “DR. SHER AFGAN KHAN 
NIAZI Versus ALI S. HABIB and others” (2011 SCMR 1813) and 
“MUHAMMAD ABBASI Versus S.H.O. Bhara Kahu and 7 others” 
(PLD 2010 SC 969) has held that in presence of availability of an 
alternate efficacious remedy, jurisdiction of this Court under Article 

W.P.No.498 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
20 
W.P.No.1633 of 2024 
199 of the “Constitution” cannot be invoked. This petition, in the 
instant point of time is therefore contradictory to the doctrine of 
ripeness and is also hit by doctrine of prematurity.  
20. 
For what has been discussed above and in the light of case law 
of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, referred to above, these writ 
petitions are disposed of with a direction to the “Petitioners” to file 
their replies by agitating all points raised in these petitions before the 
“CCP” who shall proceed ahead with an objective approach to the 
matter strictly as per law.
