Ch. Muhammad Iqbal, J:-  Through this civil revision 
the petitioners have challenged the validity of the judgment & 
decree dated 24.09.2020 passed by the learned Additional District 
Judge, Sialkot who accepted the appeal of the respondent No.1, 
set aside the judgment & decree dated 21.10.2019 passed by the 
learned Civil Judge, Sialkot and decreed the suit for specific 
performance of agreement alongwith permanent injunction filed 
by the respondent No.1. 
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that Musadaq Parvez, 
respondent No.1/plaintiff filed a suit for specific performance of 
contract alongwith permanent injunction against the petitioners/ 
defendants No.3 to 5 and Malik Muhammad Sarfraz, 
predecessor-in-interest of the respondents No.3 to 7 and 
contended that he purchased land measuring 02 Kanal 11 Marla,

No.2/Muhammad Majeed against consideration of Rs.17,85,000/- 
through written agreement to sell dated 07.02.2004. That total 
consideration was paid. That it was settled that if defendant No.1 
did not fulfill his part of the contract then he would be liable to 
pay three time of consideration i.e. Rs.53,55,000/-. That the sale 
deed was to be executed after the decision of a matter by the 
Executive District Officer (Revenue) as the injunctive order was 
in field. The respondent No.1/defendant No.1 filed contested 
written statement, denied the execution of the alleged agreement 
to sell stating that he had already alienated the suit land to 
petitioners/defendants 
through 
mutation 
No.939 
dated 
13.11.2004. The petitioners/defendants were impleaded as 
defendants in the suit through an application but they did not 
appear, upon which ex-parte proceedings were initiated against 
them. After recording ex-parte evidence, the learned trial Court 
turned down the request of the respondent No.1/plaintiff to the 
extent of specific performance of contract, however, decreed the 
alternate claim for recovery of Rs.53,55,000/- against respondent 
No.2/defendant. The respondent No.1/plaintiff challenged the 
said judgment & decree through an appeal which was dismissed 
by the learned appellate Court vide judgment & decree dated 
26.03.2011. The respondent/plaintiff assailed the said judgments 
& decrees through appeal [R.S.A No.120/2011] which was 
accepted by this Court on 26.03.2019 with the concurrence of the 
parties. The petitioners/defendants No.2 to 5 were granted 
permission to file written statement and learned trial Court was 
directed to decide the matter afresh.  
 
In post-remand proceedings, the petitioners/defendants 
filed contested written statement. The learned trial Court framed 
following issues:  

 
C.R.No.49148/2020 
 
3
1. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to get decree for specific 
performance of contract alongwith possession and grant of 
permanent injunction as prayed for? OPP 
2. Whether the defendants No.2 to 5 are bona fide purchaser 
without notice and consideration and they are owner in 
possession of suit property through mutation No.939 dated 
13.11.2004? OPD to 5 
3. Whether plaintiff has no cause of action against defendants 
No.2 to 5, and they filed this suit just to harass and blackmail 
the defendants? OPD-2 to 5. 
4. Whether the suit is liable to be dismissed with special costs u/s 
35-A of CPC? OPD 
And recorded pro and contra evidence of the parties and finally 
turned down the request of the respondent/plaintiff regarding 
specific performance of the agreement, however, decreed his 
claim for recovery of an amount of Rs.53,55,000/-. Being 
dissatisfied, the respondent No.1/plaintiff filed an appeal which 
was allowed by the learned appellate Court vide judgment & 
decree dated 24.09.2020 and by setting aside the judgment & 
decree dated 21.10.2019 passed by the learned trial Court, the suit 
of the respondent No.1/plaintiff was decreed as prayed for. 
Hence, this civil revision.  
3. 
I have heard the arguments of learned counsels for the 
parties and have gone through the record with their able 
assistance. 
4. 
In order to prove the asserted stance in the plaint as well 
as to dissipate the onus of the issue No.1, respondent No.1 / 
plaintiff Musaddaq Parvez (P.W.1) has deposed that he purchased 
land measuring 2 Kanal 11 Marla out of which land measuring 
Marla 03 Marla is situated in Mahal Adha and 2 Kanal 8 Marla is 
situated in Bheer; that Abdul Majeed was owner of the suit 
property; that on 10.03.2003 on the basis of an oral sale 
agreement he paid Rs.700,000/- through cheque which was got 
enchashed and agreement was written on 07.02.2004; that 
another amount of Rs.35,000/- in cash and Rs.50,000/- through 

 
C.R.No.49148/2020

Majeed in which he acknowledged the receipt of Rs.700,000/-; 
that agreement was written by Bashir Deed Writer on the request 
of Majeed; that stamp paper was purchased by Majeed himself; 
that first of all Majeed signed the agreement and also imposed his 
thumb impression; Muhammad Mushtaq Mehar, Imtiaz Ahmad 
Gondal and Muzammal Hussain signed as marginal witnesses; that 
as per agreement an amount of Rs.10,00,000/- was outstanding 
which he paid through cross-cheque on 05.11.2004 and in this way 
total amount was paid; that on the day of writing of the agreement, 
Majeed informed him that Executive District Officer (Revenue) 
Sialkot had issued an injunctive order regarding the suit land and 
on vacation  of the stay order he would execute the sale deed; that 
he paid the amounts through cheques; that the account of 
defendant No.1 is in HBL Ada Branch; Manager HBL also issued 
certificate (Exh.P.3) regarding credit of the said amount to the 
account; that on 19.04.2010, Majeed himself got recorded his 
statement before the Court; that defendants no.2 to 5 were aware 
about the agreement; that he himself informed defendants No.2 to 
5 as he had business relations with them; that defendants No.2 to 
5 did not pay any consideration to defendant No.1 and the 
mutation was entered just to cause loss to him; that defendants 
No.2 to 5 lodged an FIR (Exh.P.5) against defendant No.1 in 
which they admitted the execution of the agreement. He deposed 
during cross examination that defendant No.1 got recorded 
conceding statement in the Court in respect of a compromise but 
he has not affected any compromise with him; that he recorded 
statement on his own. During cross examination on behalf of 
petitioners/defendants No.2 to 5 he deposed that he stated in 
respect of oral agreement to sell dated 10.12.2003 in the suit; that 
the oral agreement was made in the office of Mian Ghulam 
Farooq Advocate who was present at the time of agreement; that

Muhammad Rafiq, the brother of defendant No.1, he (plaintiff) 
and his three witnesses were also present; that the target date was 
fixed as February; that on the demand he gave fard which 
contained an injunctive order regarding suit land; that thereafter 
the target date was fixed in agreement as 30.11.2004; that he 
never sent written notice to the defendant No.1; that it is correct 
that initially he filed suit only against defendant No.1 who 
submitted written statement; that during pendency of suit, he 
came to know that defendants No.2 to 5 had purchased suit land; 
that he came to know about the defendants No.2 to 5 before 
recording of statement by defendant No.1; that it is correct that 
on 19.04.2010 when defendant No.1 recorded statement, he was 
not owner of the suit property as he had already alienated suit 
property through the sale mutation. Muzammil Hussain (P.W.2), 
one of the marginal witnesses, deposed that Muhammad Majeed 
is owner of suit land who sold it to Musadq Pervez; that initially 
oral agreement was made on 10.12.2003 in the presence of 
plaintiff, defendant No.1, Mushtaq Ahmad Mehar and Imtiaz 
Ahmad Gondal; that earnest money Rs.700,000/- was paid 
through cheque and agreement was written on 07.02.2004; that 
the deed writer read over the agreement to both the parties. 
Majeed signed and imposed thumb impression on agreement 
(Exh.P.1); that in the agreement earlier paid amount of 
Rs.700,000/- is also mentioned; that at the time of agreement, an 
amount of Rs.35,000/- was paid in cash and Rs.50,000/- paid 
through cross cheque and remaining amount Rs.10,00,000/- was 
paid through cheque on 15.11.2004 in the presence of witnesses; 
that sale deed could not be executed due to pendency of partition 
application before EDOR wherein injunctive order was passed; 
that defendants No.2 to 5 were fully aware of the agreement with 
Musaddaq; that defendants No.2 to 5 on the basis of mala fide 
intention without consideration got incorporated mutation. which 

 
C.R.No.49148/2020 
 
6
was attested with the collusiveness of defendant No.1. During 
cross examination, he deposed that the bargain was completed in 
the office of Mian Ghulam Farooq Advocate; that at the time of 
bargain he accompanied the plaintiff; that when defendant No.1 
brought fard, stay was entered on it; that due to stay, sale deed 
could not be executed; that stay was granted by the EDOR. 
Imtiaz Ahmad Gondal (P.W.3) has deposed that the suit land is 
owned by Muhammad Majeed who sold it to Musadaq Parvez 
against Rs.35,000/- per Marla and total consideration was fixed 
as Rs.17,50,000/-; that on 10.12.2003 oral bargain was completed 
and at the time of oral bargain, plaintiff, defendant No.1, he, 
Mushtaq Mehar and Muzammal Hussain were present; that the 
oral bargain was duly reduced into written shape on 07.02.2004 
which agreement is Exh.P.1 which was written by Bashir Ahmad 
Deed Writer on the request of Muhammad Majeed which was 
read over by Deed Writer in the presence of all the parties; that 
after admitting the agreement (Exh.P.1) as correct, Muhammad 
Majeed signed and imposed thumb impression on the said 
agreement and Majeed also imposed thumb impression on the 
register of Deed Writer; that after signatures of Muhammad 
Majeed, the witnesses also signed the agreement; that defendants 
No.2 to 5 were fully aware about the agreement (Exh.P.1) which 
was executed by Muhammad Majeed; that when agreement

amount Rs.700,000/- earlier paid through cheque was also 
mentioned; that sale deed was not executed due to stay order 
issued by EDOR; that defendants No.2 to 5 despite knowledge of 
the payment of complete consideration amount and existence of 
agreement in favour of the plaintiff, procured a sale mutation in 
collusiveness with defendant No.1 only to cause loss to the 

 
C.R.No.49148/2020 
 
7
plaintiff. During cross examination he deposed that bargain was 
completed in the office of Mian Ghulam Farooq Advocate.  
5. 
Conversely, Malik Zulfiqar Ahmad appeared has as sole 
witness as D.W.1 who deposed that the suit land measuring 02 
Kanal 08 Marla situated in Moza Bheer was purchased by him 
from defendant No.1 Muhammad Majeed on 13.11.2004 against 
consideration of Rs.200,000/-; that the possession was taken 
before the agreement but he could not remember the date; that 
mutation was entered in their names and all the four brothers on 
the basis of equal share; that an old structure of house was 
existing at the site which was demolished and the land was used 
for a factory. During cross examination, he deposed that on 
13.11.2004 an agreement was executed between the parties and 
Ashiq Hussain and Zafar Iqbal were the witnesses of the said 
agreement. He further deposed that:

6. 
The case of the petitioners/defendants is that they are bona 
fide purchasers of the suit land for value without notice of the 
earlier agreement between respondents No.2/defendant and 
respondent No.1/plaintiff, thus transaction in their favour is 
protected by Section 27(b) of The Specific Relief Act, 1877 and 
same cannot be interfered with. As such, it would be expedient to 
reproduce the Proviso of Section 27 of the Act ibid which is as 
under: 
“27. Relief against parties and persons claiming under them by 
subsequent title.– Except as otherwise provided by this Chapter, 
specific performance of a contract may be enforced against– 
      (a)  either party thereto; 
      (b)  any other person claiming under him by a title arising 
subsequently to the contract, except a transferee for value who has 

 
C.R.No.49148/2020 
 
8
paid his money in good faith and without notice of the original 
contract.” 
 
As per sub-Clause b of Section 27 of the Act ibid, the petitioners 
have to establish through affirmative and corroborative evidence 
that they purchased the suit land with good faith and without 
notice of the earlier original contract but as per attested copy of 
FIR dated 18.10.2005 which was lodged by petitioner No.2/Malik 
Muhammad Riaz against respondent No.2/defendant No.1 
(brought on record by the respondent No.1/plaintiff as Exh.P.5) 
wherein he alleged that the defendant No.1 had committed fraud 
with them as he had already sold the suit land to respondent 
No.1/plaintiff after receiving the consideration. For reference, 
relevant portion of the contents of the FIR (Ex.P-5) are 
reproduced as under:

Admittedly, FIR (Exh.P.5) was got registered by the petitioners’ 
side by describing their own stance regarding existence of fraud 
in the transaction in their favour. Ex.P-5 is an attested copy of 
FIR and it is settled law that presumption of genuineness is 

 
C.R.No.49148/2020

attached to the attested copies of the public record if not rebutted 
otherwise. Reliance is placed on Chaudhary Inayat Ali v. 
Province of Punjab through D.O.R. (Collector) and another 
(2016 MLD 1870). The contents of the FIR amounted to 
admission on the part of the petitioners/defendants that they knew 
the fact of agreement to sell between respondents No.1 & 2 prior 
to 
the 
transfer 
of 
the 
suit 
land 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
petitioners/defendants through alleged mutation. It is settled law 
that admitted facts need not to be proved. Reliance is placed on 
the case cited as Mst. Rehmat and others Vs. Mst. Zubaida Begum 
and others (2021 SCMR 1534).  
The Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in a judgment cited as 
Hafiz Tasadduq Hussain Vs. Lal Khatoon and others (PLD 2011 
SC 296) has held that initial onus is on the shoulder of a 
subsequent vendee to prove that his case falls within the purview 
and parameter of Section 27 of the Act ibid and that he is a 
transferee of the land for value, the consideration has been paid in 
good faith and that he had no notice of the earlier contract of the 
property. But in this case, the petitioners/defendants have failed 
to prove that their case falls within the purview and parameter of 
Section 27 ibid as they entered into sale transaction of the suit 
land with the respondent No.2 despite having knowledge of his 
agreement to sell with the respondent No.1/plaintiff.  
7.  
Malik Zulfiqar (D.W.1) stated in his cross examination 
that an agreement was written on 13.11.2004 in presence of 
Ashiq Hussain and Zafar Iqbal and the sale deed was executed 
subsequently but the petitioners/defendants neither produced said 
alleged agreement nor the marginal witnesses of the said 
agreement. Furthermore, said Malik Muhammad Riaz, who 
lodged FIR against the respondent No.2/defendant No.1 did not 
appear as witness. The petitioners/defendants also did not 

 
C.R.No.49148/2020 
 
10
produce the witnesses of the mutation, the Patwari and Tehsildar 
concerned and non-production of such material witnesses is 
amounted to withholding of the best evidence and it would be 
legally presumed that had the said witnesses produced in the 
evidence, 
they 
would 
have 
deposed 
against 
the 
petitioners/defendants, as such presumption under Article 129 (g) 
of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 clearly does not give them any 
favour. Reliance is placed on the case of Sughran Bibi Vs. Mst. 
Aziz Begum & 4 Others (1996 SCMR 137) and Jehangir Vs Mst. 
Shams Sultana & Others (2022 SCMR 309).  
8.  
In paragraph No.3 of the written statement, respondent 
No.2/defendant No.1 admitted the very bargain, receiving of 
earnest money as well as execution of agreement to sell in favour 
of respondent No.1/plaintiff. The respondent No.1/plaintiff 
produced bank certificate (Exh.P.2) issued by the bank in respect 
of the encashment of cheques. At the time of presentation of the 
said document, no objection was raised on behalf of the 
petitioners/defendants, thus validity and authenticity of the bank 
certificate (Ex.P-2) could not be questioned subsequently. It is 
established from the record that the petitioners/ defendants have 
knowledge of the earlier transaction of sale of the suit land by the 
respondent No.2 in favour of respondent No.1/plaintiff, as such 
the subsequent transaction of sale by way of incorporating oral 
sale mutation in the revenue record by the respondent No.2 in 
favour of the petitioners/defendants cannot supersede the earlier 
agreement.  
9.  
In the written statement, the petitioners/defendants neither 
disclosed the lodging of FIR nor mentioned / proved purchasing 
of suit land with due care and caution as required under the 
principle of caveat emptor. Since the petitioners/defendants did 
not take reasonable bonafide care while entering into 
sale/purchase 
transaction 
through 
sale 
mutation. 
The 

 
C.R.No.49148/2020 
 
11
petitioners/defendants have the notice of the agreement to sell 
executed in favour of respondent No.1/plaintiff by respondent 
No.2/defendant No.2 and despite knowledge of earlier agreement 
they allegedly purchased the land in question from respondent 
No.2, as such they are not bona file purchasers and they are not 
entitled for protection under Section 27 of the Act ibid as well as 
Section 41 of the Transfer of Property Act. Reliance in this 
regard is placed on cases cited as Abdul Rashid Vs. Muhammad 
Yaseen and another (2010 SCMR 1871) and Noor Hassan and 
others Vs. Ali Sher and others (2015 SCMR 452).  
10. 
As regard the stance of the petitioners/defendants that a 
penalty clause is available in the agreement to sell of the 
respondent/plaintiff who while filing the suit prayed for grant 
relief of specific performance of the contract or as in alternate the 
implementation of penalty clause, as such the relief of specific 
performance of the alleged agreement to sell cannot be granted. 
As per Section 19 of The Specific Relief Act, a person who files 
a suit for specific performance may also ask for compensation for 
breach of contract and he can add to or in substitution for such 
performance. Section 20 of Act ibid also provides that the amount 
may be claimed as compensation in case of default of the 
contract. The respondent/ plaintiff in his suit for specific 
performance also prayed for grant of the amount of compensation, 
as such this prayer cannot be termed as withdrawal of claim from 
specific performance of the contract. Reliance is placed on 
judgments cited as Abdul Karim Vs. Muhammad Shafi and another 
(1973 SCMR 225) and Mrs. Mussarat Shaukat Ali Vs. Mrs. Safia 
Khatoon (1994 SCMR 2189). 
11. 
The respondent No.1/plaintiff filed suit for specific 
performance on the basis of written agreement to sell dated 
(Exh.P.1), appeared in the witness box and reiterated his stance as 
taken in the pleadings, produced both the marginal witnesses 

 
C.R.No.49148/2020 
 
12
whose deposition despite lengthy cross examination could not be 
shattered. In this way, it can safely be held that the 
respondent/plaintiff proved his case through credible, trustworthy 
& corroborative oral as well as documentary evidence that his 
agreement to sell with the respondent No.2/defendant No.1 was 
prior in time and the petitioners/defendants despite having 
knowledge of the earlier transaction, got alienated suit land in 
their favour through oral sale mutation which is not sustainable 
and is liable to be cancelled. Reliance in this regard is placed on 
an order dated 10.01.2023 passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court 
of Pakistan in Civil Petition No.1481 of 2019 titled as Mst. 
Parveen Akhtar Vs. Mian Salah ud Din & others wherein it is 
held as under: 
4. The findings of the learned trial court that the power of 
attorney by the original owner i.e. respondent No.2 in favour 
of his son Bashir Ahmad being subsequent in time, therefore, 
the said power of attorney superseded the power of attorney 
in favour of plaintiff/ respondent No.1. We are afraid that 
these findings are not in accordance with law. Further 
admittedly the plaintiff /respondent was in possession and is 
in possession of the suit property till today. Petitioner when 
appeared as her own witness as DW-1, she does not claim 
delivery of possession under sale by the Attorney of the 
original owner in her favour. In cross-examination she stated 
that Bashir Ahmad handed over the keys of the house and she 
has not visited the house and not entered the house. In these 
circumstances, we are unable to disagree with the findings 
recorded by the learned High Court. Learned Counsel failed 
to make out a case for grant of leave. Resultantly, leave to 
appeal is refused and this petition stands dismissed. 
 
12. 
The learned trial court has failed to appreciate the legal 
and factual aspects of the case and dismissed the suit of the 
respondent No.1/plaintiff to the extent of specific performance 
whereas the learned appellate court after discussing the facts as 
well as evidence of the parties, through a well-reasoned judgment 
& decree has rightly allowed the appeal of the respondent No.1 

 
C.R.No.49148/2020 
 
13
and decreed the suit as prayed for. It is well settled law that in the 
event of conflict of judgments of the Courts below, findings of 
appellate Court are to be preferred and respected, unless it is 
shown from the record that such findings are not supported by 
evidence and record. Reliance is placed on the case reported as 
Muhammad Hafeez & Another Vs. District Judge, Karachi East 
& Another (2008 SCMR 398). 
13. 
Resultantly, this revision petition is hereby dismissed 
being devoid of any force. No order as to costs.
