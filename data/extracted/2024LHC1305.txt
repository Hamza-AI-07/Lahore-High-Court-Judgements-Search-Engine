MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.- 
Through instant petition, petitioner (Sirdar Mohy Ud Din Khan 
Khosa) has assailed orders dated 21.03.2024 and 27.03.2024, 
passed by the Returning Officer, and learned Election Tribunal, 
respectively, 
whereby 
his 
nomination 
papers 
for 
the 
constituency PP-290, D.G. Khan-V were rejected concurrently.  
2. 
Learned counsel for petitioner submits that admittedly 
petitioner is not a default in payment of income tax as he has 
already paid all the taxes in view of NOC issued by the FBR 
and the error / defect while making certain entries in the 
columns of the affidavit, which found force with both the foras 
below to reject the nomination papers, is not substantial in 
nature, therefore, in view of proviso (ii) to sub-section (9) of 
section 62 of the Elections Act, 2017, the same could be 

 
W. P. No.4005 of 2024 
2
remedied. He contends that petitioner furnished tax returns 
showing correct account of paid income tax and there was no 
discrepancy as to paid amount of tax, therefore, some mistake / 
error in filling relevant column of the affidavit, mentioning 
taxable incomes in the column of total income tax paid, cannot 
be termed as false statement / untrue declaration regarding 
payment of income tax. He argues that even no opportunity was 
provided to petitioner to explain the discrepancy, hence, the 
impugned orders are unsustainable in the eye of law. 
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for Election Commission of 
Pakistan, duly assisted by learned Assistant Attorney General, 
defends the impugned orders by submitting that it was a case of 
false / incorrect declaration, thus, the nomination papers of 
petitioner was rightly rejected within the contemplation of 
section 62(9)(c) of the Elections Act, 2017.  
  
Though, respondents No.3 & 7 did not raise any 
objections before the Returning Officer against nomination 
papers of petitioner, however they are duly represented before us 
and their learned counsel have supported the stance of learned 
counsel for Election Commission of Pakistan. The remaining 
private respondents are not in attendance despite issuance of 
notice, hence they are proceeded against ex parte. 
 
 
 
4. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused. 
5. 
Nomination papers of petitioner were rejected by the 
Returning Officer allegedly on account of furnishing a false 
declaration / statement with regard to payment of income tax of 
03 years i.e. 2021, 2022 & 2023, and this treatment was also 
upheld by learned Election Tribunal. We have been invited to 
go through the contents of the Affidavit furnished by petitioner, 
relevant part whereof is as under:- 
 
Total Income

Income 
Tax Year

3184000

6. 
The question before us is whether aforesaid error in the 
column total income tax paid is substantial in nature or could 
have been remedied in view of proviso (ii) to sub-section (9) of 
section 62 of the Elections Act, 2017. Before dilating upon the 
question, the aforesaid proviso is reproduced hereunder for ease 
of reference:- 
“Provided that— 
(i) 
…. 
(ii) 
the Returning Officer shall not reject a nomination 
paper on the ground of any defect which is not of a 
substantial nature and may allow any such defect to 
be remedied forthwith, including an error in regard to 
the name, serial number in the electoral roll or other 
particulars of the candidate or his proposer or 
seconder so as to bring them in conformity with the 
corresponding entries in the electoral roll.”   
7. 
The income tax returns, attached with the nomination 
papers, reflect that for the year 2021 taxable income was 
Rs.2,784,000/- and chargeable tax was Rs.244,700/-, for the year 
2022 taxable income was Rs.2,440,000/- and chargeable tax was 
Rs.186,000/- and for the year 2023, taxable income was 
Rs.1,219,980/- and tax chargeable was Rs.80,148/-. It is 
evidently clear that petitioner mistakenly mentioned the taxable 
income in the column of total income tax paid of the affidavit. 
Record reflects that in response to letter issued by the Returning 
Officer, Additional Commissioner Inland Revenue, Lahore, vide 
letter dated 21.03.2024, furnished details of chargeable tax as 
Rs.244,700/- for the year 2021, Rs.186,000/- for the year 2022 
and Rs.80,148/- for the year 2023, which are the same figures 
reflecting in the tax returns furnished by petitioner. It is evident 
from the impugned order of the Returning Officer that petitioner 
had deposited the afore-noted due tax. Petitioner has also 
tendered NOC dated 15.03.2024, which reflects that no tax 
demand was outstanding against petitioner on account of income 
tax till said date. Thus, it is clear that no liability was existing 
against petitioner and he was not defaulter in the payment of due 
tax. In these circumstances, wrong entries in the columns of total 

 
W. P. No.4005 of 2024 
4
income and income tax paid of petitioner’s affidavit are mere 
bona fide mistakes / clerical errors in preparing the affidavit, 
which are not so grave to invite rejection of his nomination 
papers. The said entries could have been fatal if the omission 
would have been with the purpose to avoid payment of income 
tax or intended to conceal some wrongdoing. Needless to 
observe that the Returning Officer has been given the power 
under proviso (ii) to sub-section (9) of section 62 of the Elections 
Act, 2017 to correct such defects in the nomination papers which 
are not of substantial nature, but no such exercise was 
undertaken in the instant case. In these circumstances, the 
impugned orders are not legally sustainable. Reference can be 
made to Malik Shakeel Awan v. Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed and 21 
others (PLD 2018 Supreme Court 643), Khawaja Muhammad 
Asif v. Muhammad Usman Dar and others (2018 SCMR 2128), 
Nida Khuhro v. Moazzam Ali Khan and others (2019 SCMR 
1684) and Shamona Badshah Qaisarani v. Election Tribunal, 
Multan and others (2021 SCMR 988). 
8. 
Before parting with this judgment, we observe that right 
to contest election is a fundamental right guaranteed by Article 
17(2) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973, and the provisions in the Elections Act, 2017 that curtail 
or in any manner affect this right are to be construed strictly 
and applied restrictively, especially when the defect is not of 
substantial nature and can be remedied. Steering thought can 
be gathered from latest decisions of the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan vide order dated 29.01.2024, passed in Civil Petition 
No.150 & 152 of 2024 titled Tahir Sadiq v. Faisal Ali, etc. and 
order dated 26.01.2024, passed in Civil Petition No.181 of 
2024 titled Pervez Elahi v. Election Commission of Pakistan, 
etc. Some of the observations in the case of Tariq Sadiq supra 
are reproduced hereunder:- 
“3.  
It is in this context of both the right of the candidates 
to contest the election and the right of the voters to vote for 
the candidate of their choice that the qualification and 

 
W. P. No.4005 of 2024 
5
disqualification of a candidate become material. The aim of 
prescribing 
qualifications 
and 
disqualifications 
for 
candidacies to contest elections is to maintain the integrity 
and effectiveness of the political process. They are designed 
to ensure that individuals holding public office meet certain 
standards. In a well-functioning democracy, the criteria for 
qualifications and disqualifications are clearly defined, 
publicly known and uniformly applied. Qualifications and 
disqualifications of a candidate for the electoral process 
must therefore be clearly spelled out in the Constitution or 
the law. Otherwise, electoral laws must be interpreted in 
favour of enfranchisement rather than disenfranchisement so 
that maximum choice remains with the voters to elect their 
future leadership. With this approach rooted in the high 
constitutional rights and values, the courts are to deal with 
the matters of acceptance or rejection of the nomination 
papers filed for contesting elections.” 
9. 
In view of the above, instant petition is allowed and 
impugned orders are set aside being illegal and without lawful 
authority. In consequence, nomination papers of petitioner stands 
accepted, he is allowed to contest the election and participate in 
all the subsequent steps / stages of the announced election 
schedule.
