JUDGMENT 
 
Date of Hearing:

Appellant By: 
Mr. Saqib Asghar, Advocate 
Mr. Mudassar Hassan, Advocate 
Respondents No. 2-a to 2-c By: 
Mr. Haris Bin Hassan Jang, Advocate 
Applicant in C.M. No. 3-C/2022 By: 
Syed Danish Ghazi, Advocate   
 
ABID HUSSAIN CHATTHA, J: This Appeal is directed against the 
impugned Order communicated to the Appellant vide letter dated 
04.07.2022 on behalf of Respondent No. 1 (the “Copyright Board”), 
whereby, an application for rectification No. 26 of 2020 of Respondents 
No. 2-a to 2-c (the “Respondents”) filed through special attorney, namely, 
Sohail Riaz was accepted and in consequence thereof, copyright entry 
under registration No. 40552-Copr dated 19.02.2020, titled “IK AKRAM 
RAHI” (the “Poetry Book”) in favour of the Appellant was ordered to be 
expunged and cancelled.  
2. 
 
The brief facts of this case are that the Respondents filed an 
application under Section 41(2) of the Copyright Ordinance, 1962                   
(the “Copyright Ordinance”) seeking to rectify the Register of Copyrights 
by expunging therefrom entry of registration of the Poetry Book registered 
in favour of the Appellant. It was averred in the application that the Poetry 
Book consisting of 1406 pages is not an authentic work of the Appellant, 
rather, the same is plagiarized. References were made to some poems and 
songs statedly written and sung by different persons in an endeavour to 

2 
 
 
 
 
F. A. O. No. 46541 / 2022 
 
 
demonstrate claim of the Respondents that in fact, intellectual property 
rights regarding the same belong to others which have been infringed by 
incorporating the same in the Poetry Book of the Appellant as his original 
work. It was also claimed that the Respondents hold ownership rights by 
way of assignment from some of the original authors and singers whose 
poetry or songs are included in the Poetry Book. It was also asserted that a 
defense schedule to claim filed in the Birmingham High Court by the 
Appellant and his Solicitor with a statement of truth in relation to eleven 
works included in the Poetry Book testify that they were not authentic or 
original work of the Appellant. As such, the Appellant had concealed 
material facts while applying and obtaining copyright in his name 
regarding the Poetry Book in violation of various provisions of the 
Copyright Ordinance.    
3. 
 
The Appellant, in his counter statement, resisted claim of the 
Respondents by submitting that he is a renowned international poet, writer, 
singer, producer, compiler and composer and has released a number of 
music albums. He applied and obtained copyright of his Poetry Book with 
clean hands for protection of his intellectual property rights under Section 
39 of the Copyright Ordinance and the same was granted after following 
due process of law. As such, the Appellant is an original singer, lyrics 
writer, composer and compiler of work incorporated in the Poetry Book. 
4. 
 
The Copyright Board after hearing both the parties and 
examining the evidence placed on record opined that, prima facie, it 
appears that the Poetry Book of the Appellant is not an authentic literary 
and original work, rather, the same is plagiarized. Accordingly, the 
application for rectification was allowed and entry of copyright in favour 
of the Appellant was ordered to be expunged. Hence, this Appeal.  
5. 
 
At the very outset, learned counsel for the Appellant raised a 
serious objection qua jurisdiction of the Copyright Board to hear and 
decide rectification applications based on infringement of intellectual 
property rights. He contended that the Intellectual Property Organization of 
Pakistan Act, 2012 (the “IPO Act”) created and established the Intellectual 

3 
 
 
 
 
F. A. O. No. 46541 / 2022 
 
 
Property Organization (the “IPO”) to administer regulation of all 
intellectual property rights previously vested in different regulatory bodies 
under scattered existing intellectual property laws in Pakistan. Similarly, 
forum of remedy for infringement of intellectual property rights has been 
streamlined 
by 
establishing 
Intellectual 
Property 
Tribunal 
(the 
“Tribunal”) under Section 16 of the IPO Act which exercises exclusive 
jurisdiction under Section 18 thereof with respect to infringement of 
intellectual property rights under all intellectual property laws included in 
the Schedule of the Act. As such, the IPO Act provides for the Tribunal as 
a consolidated and exclusive forum to adjudicate all civil proceedings 
regarding infringement of intellectual property laws in substitution of 
various remedies before different forums under existing intellectual 
property laws. The purpose is achieved by conferring an overriding effect 
to the IPO Act over all other intellectual property laws under Section 39 
thereof. The precise issue has been settled in case titled “Messrs Shaheen 
Chemist through Proprietors and 3 others versus Zahid Mehmood 
Chaudhry and another” (2023 CLD 1). Hence, the Copyright Board did not 
have jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate upon the rectification 
application which was based upon claims of infringement of intellectual 
property rights of others. The point of jurisdiction was verbally but 
vociferously raised before the Copyright Board which goes to the root of 
the case but no finding to this effect was rendered. As such, the impugned 
Order is patently without jurisdiction, void ab initio and coram non judice.   
6. 
 
Conversely, learned counsel for the Respondents submitted 
that question of jurisdiction was not taken in writing in counter statement 
of the Appellant and as such, cannot be raised before this Court. In any 
event, the objection qua jurisdiction is misconceived for the reason that 
jurisdiction vested with the Tribunal under the IPO Act in terms of Section 
18 thereof, is limited with respect to infringement of intellectual property 
rights under intellectual property laws, whereas, the Application for 
rectification did not question the infringement of any intellectual property 
right of the Respondents but merely sought rectification simpliciter on the 

4 
 
 
 
 
F. A. O. No. 46541 / 2022 
 
 
ground that the Appellant had applied and obtained copyright of his Poetry 
Book by concealing material facts and as such, the same was erroneously 
granted to him. Hence, the matter exclusively fell within jurisdiction of the 
Copyright Board under Section 41(2) of the Copyright Ordinance and 
therefore, the rectification application was rightly accepted. 
7. 
 
It is well entrenched in our jurisprudence that question of 
jurisdiction of an adjudicating forum goes to the very root of the case and if 
such forum is not vested with the jurisdiction to decide the dispute or 
assumes jurisdiction not vested in it, the order passed by it is void ab initio 
and of no legal effect. When the Court does not have jurisdiction, no 
amount of consent or acquiescence can invest such Court with such 
jurisdiction. It is also well settled that point of jurisdiction is purely a 
question of law which can be raised even if it has not been taken in writing, 
although propriety demands that it should be raised in the first instance. 
Since the impugned Order is silent with respect to the question of 
jurisdiction, therefore, notwithstanding that the same was raised and not 
determined, or it was not raised at all, this Court in appellate jurisdiction 
which is a continuation of original proceedings, finds it obligatory to 
address the same. For reference see cases titled, “Muslim Commercial 
Bank Limited versus Muhammad Anwar Mandokhel and others” (2024 
SCMR 298); “Dr. Tahir Masud versus Amjad Ali Khan and 4 others” 
(2019 PLC (C.S.) 1167); and “WAPDA through Chairman and 3 others 
versus Khalid Pervaiz” (2015 YLR 1598). The following point of 
reference emerges from rival contentions of the parties for determination 
by this Court: 
Whether the Copyright Board under Section 41(2) of the 
Copyright Ordinance or the Tribunal under Section 18 of the 
IPO Act has the jurisdiction to decide rectification 
applications? 
8. 
 
In order to address the query, it is imperative to comparatively 
examine the Copyright Ordinance and the IPO Act. It is pertinent to 
mention that prior to the promulgation of the IPO Act, various special laws 

5 
 
 
 
 
F. A. O. No. 46541 / 2022 
 
 
were enacted to regulate, protect and safeguard various intellectual 
property rights. The Copyright Ordinance is one such statute which was 
promulgated in 1962 with the objective to amend and consolidate the law 
relating to copyrights. It seeks to create a regulatory regime to administer 
multiple facets of copyrights law. It defines and prescribes conceptual 
contours and legal rights with respect to copyrights and associated rights 
regarding publication, ownership, recognition, assignment, relinquishment, 
licenses, registration, infringement, prohibitions, offences, penalties and 
enforcement. At the same time, remedies are provided to an aggrieved 
party for enjoyment and protection of such rights. Section 38(1) of the 
Copyright Ordinance entrusts the Registrar of Copyrights to maintain a 
register in the prescribed form to be called the Register of Copyrights for 
entering the names or title of works and names and addresses of authors, 
publishers and owners of copyright and such other particulars as may be 
prescribed. Section 39 thereof stipulates the procedure for applying before 
the Registrar for grant or refusal of copyright. Similarly, Section 40 thereof 
empowers the Registrar to grant or refuse registration of an interest in a 
copyright to any person, either by assignment or licence. The refusal to 
register a copyright or an interest therein under Sections 39 and 40 of the 
Copyright Ordinance by the Registrar mandates the latter to record reasons 
for such refusal. Section 41 of the Copyright Ordinance pertains to 
correction of entries in the Register of Copyrights and indexes and is 
commonly referred as rectification of Register. The said provision is at the 
center of controversy and is reproduced below for ready reference: 
 
“41. Correction of Entries in the Register of Copyrights and 
Indexes, etc.  
 
(1)  
The Registrar may in the prescribed cases and subject to the 
prescribed conditions, amend or alter the Register of Copyrights and 
indexes by--   
 
(a) 
correcting any error in any name, address or particular; or  
 
(b) 
correcting any other error which may have arisen therein by 
accidental slip or omission. 

6 
 
 
 
 
F. A. O. No. 46541 / 2022 
 
 
(2) 
The Board, on application of the Registrar or of any person 
aggrieved, may order the rectification of the Register of Copyrights 
by-  
 
(a) 
the making of any entry wrongly omitted to be made in the 
Register, or  
 
(b) 
the expunging of any entry wrongly made in, or remaining on, 
the Register, or  
 
(c) 
the correction of any error or defect in the Register.” 
 
9. 
 
Section 43 establishes the Copyright Office to administer and 
regulate provisions of the Copyright Ordinance and proclaims that the 
Copyright Office shall be under the immediate control of the Registrar of 
Copyrights who shall act under the superintendence and directions of the 
Federal Government. The Copyright Board is constituted under Section 45 
of the Copyright Ordinance and consists of a Chairman and three to five 
other Members appointed from outside the Copyright Office by the Federal 
Government. Powers and procedure of the Copyright Board are listed in 
Section 46 of the Copyright Ordinance. Chapter XII of the Copyright 
Ordinance deals with infringement of copyrights. Section 56 thereof lists in 
detail instances when a copyright is infringed, whereas, Section 57 thereof 
is couched in negative covenants narrating acts which do not constitute an 
infringement of a copyright.     
10. 
 
Chapter XIII of the Copyright Ordinance deals with civil 
remedies that may be availed for infringement of various rights emanating 
from infringement of copyrights. Section 65 thereof designates the District 
Court as the forum for every suit or other civil proceeding regarding 
infringement of copyrights provided that, where the person whose 
copyright in a work has been infringed does not intend to institute a suit or 
proceeding in the District Court, he may by Petition in the prescribed 
manner, refer the matter to the Copyright Board for decision. Sub-Sections 
(4) & (5) of Section 65 of the Copyright Ordinance conjunctively provide 
that in such an eventuality, the Copyright Board shall decide the matter to 
the exclusion of the Court which shall be final subject to the decision of 
appeal, if any, and shall be executed in the manner provided in Section 79 

7 
 
 
 
 
F. A. O. No. 46541 / 2022 
 
 
thereof. Offences and penalties for infringement of copyrights or other 
rights conferred by the Copyright Ordinance are described in various 
provisions under Chapter XIV of the Copyright Ordinance, whereas, 
Section 72 thereof provides that no Court inferior to that of the Magistrate 
of First Class shall try any offence under the Copyright Ordinance. 
Sections 75 to 77 under Chapter XV of the Copyright Ordinance relate to 
appeals. The forum of appeal against certain orders of Magistrate is the 
Court to which such appeals would ordinarily lie. Appeal against any final 
decision or order of the Registrar is provided to the Copyright Board. 
Appeal against the decision or order of the Copyright Board, not being the 
decision or order made in an appeal under Section 76 of the Copyright 
Ordinance, is provided with the concerned High Court. Section 82 of the 
Copyright Ordinance vests rule making power to the Federal Government 
for carrying out purposes of the Copyright Ordinance. In exercise of such 
powers, the Copyright Rules, 1967 have been made which further elaborate 
procedure and requirements for enforcement of various rights under the 
Copyright Ordinance. 
11. 
 
It follows from the above that a self-contained scheme of law 
is encapsulated in the Copyright Ordinance. The jurisdiction to administer 
the copyrights law is primarily vested in the office of the Registrar. The 
Copyright Board acts as an external independent forum to perform various 
functions, such as, to decide the sufficiency of quantity of copies of 
publications to the public under Section 4(2); if the term of copyright for 
any work is shorter in any other country than provided for in Pakistan 
under Section 6(2); the term of assignment under Section 14(2A); identity 
of the author under explanation to Section 21 and Section 59; objections 
qua published statements pursuant to Section 32 under Section 33; grant of 
licence in work withheld from public under Section 36; grant of licence to 
produce and publish translations under Section 37; correction of entries in 
the Register of Copyrights and indexes under Section 41(2); rate of 
royalties under Section 57(1)(j)(ii); suits or other civil proceedings under 
Section 65 in substitution of powers of the Court; appeals against the final 

8 
 
 
 
 
F. A. O. No. 46541 / 2022 
 
 
decision or order of the Registrar under Section 76; and the amount of 
compensation under Section 84(1) of the Copyright Ordinance.  
12. 
 
It is manifestly clear that some of the functions assigned to the 
Copyright Board under the Copyright Ordinance do not involve instances 
of infringement of copyrights. However, the Copyright Board is also 
empowered to decide suits and civil proceedings involving infringement of 
copyrights or other rights flowing thereunder under Section 65 of the 
Copyright Ordinance. Similarly, it is empowered to hear appeals against 
final orders of the Registrar under Section 76 of the Copyright Ordinance 
without any distinction qua questions involving infringement or otherwise 
of copyrights. The bare perusal of Section 41(1) of the Copyright 
Ordinance reflects that the Registrar is empowered with respect to 
prescribed cases and subject to prescribed conditions, to amend or alter the 
Register of Copyrights and indexes by correcting any error in any name, 
address or particular; or correcting any other error which may have arisen 
therein by accidental slip or omission. However, Section 41(2) of the 
Copyright Ordinance confers broad, unlimited and comprehensive powers 
to the Copyright Board to pass an order with respect to rectification of the 
Register of Copyrights regarding the making of any entry wrongly omitted 
to be made or the expunging of any entry wrongly made in or, remaining 
on the Register or the correction of any error or defect in the Register. The 
Copyright Board is empowered to exercise such powers on application of 
the Registrar or of any person aggrieved in this respect. Once again, the 
power of rectification of the Copyright Board is general in character and 
does not distinguish between rectification applications simpliciter or based 
on allegations of infringement of copyrights or breach of intellectual 
property rights. The term ‘rectification’ is not specifically defined in the 
Copyright Ordinance, therefore, will necessarily entail ordinary dictionary 
meaning and in the context of the Copyright Ordinance, would mean that 
the Copyright Board can adjudicate all claims against the grant or refusal 
of registration of copyright or an interest therein on application of the 
Registrar or an aggrieved person with or without allegations of 

9 
 
 
 
 
F. A. O. No. 46541 / 2022 
 
 
infringement of intellectual property rights. Therefore, it is abundantly 
obvious that Copyright Board apart from other functions is also conferred 
with the jurisdiction to decide claims regarding infringement of copyrights 
under the Copyright Ordinance which includes rectification applications 
based on infringement of intellectual property rights. 
13. 
 
The next question is to explore as to how the IPO Act as a 
subsequent enactment has affected powers of the Copyright Board as 
designated forum of remedy for all kinds of rectification applications under 
the Copyright Ordinance. The IPO Act was promulgated in the year 2012 
with the primary objective to establish the IPO for protection of various 
intellectual property rights to foster creative thinking, stimulate creativity, 
provide incentives for technological innovations and attract investments. 
An institutional arrangement was designed in an endeavour to embrace 
exclusivity in terms of governance and regulation of multiple and various 
intellectual property rights being administered through isolated and 
fragmented intellectual property laws. The idea of a consolidated 
regulatory regime was realized by integration of Trade Marks Registry, 
Copyright Office and Patent Office established under different statutes 
with the IPO through Section 36 of the IPO Act which proclaims as such, 
notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in 
force and upon commencement of the IPO Act. Needless to state that the 
IPO Act is currently completely in force. Section 2(h) of the IPO Act 
defines ‘intellectual property laws’ as the laws specified in its Schedule 
which include the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 (the “Trade Marks 
Ordinance”), the Copyright Ordinance, the Patents Ordinance, 2000, the 
Registered Designs Ordinance, 2000, the Registered Layout-Designs of 
Integrated Circuits Ordinance, 2000 and specified provisions of Pakistan 
Penal Code, 1860. The IPO is established under Section 3 of the IPO Act 
and the policy board was setup under Section 4 thereof. Section 15 of the 
IPO Act stipulates powers and functions of the IPO which include some 
overarching and all-encompassing powers. Mention may be made to 
Section 15(viii) thereof which confers power upon the IPO to control, 

10 
 
 
 
 
F. A. O. No. 46541 / 2022 
 
 
manage, supervise, direct and coordinate the working of all intellectual 
property offices established under intellectual property laws and any other 
office or registry established under intellectual property laws to be notified 
by the Federal Government or any other registry or office as prescribed. 
Section 16 of the IPO Act establishes independent Tribunal(s) to exercise 
jurisdiction under the IPO Act. Section 17 of the IPO Act vests powers in 
the Tribunal(s) under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1898 with respect to exercise of civil and criminal 
jurisdictions, respectively. Section 17(4) thereof provides that subject to 
Sub-Section (5) thereof, no Court other than a Tribunal shall have or 
exercise any jurisdiction with respect to any matter to which jurisdiction of 
the Tribunal extends under the IPO Act. Sub-Section (5) thereof further 
provides that nothing in Sub-Section (4) shall be deemed to affect any 
proceedings pending before such Court immediately before coming into 
force of the IPO Act. Sub-Section (6) thereof states that all suits and 
proceedings pending in any Court instituted under intellectual property 
laws shall stand transferred to, and be heard and disposed of by, the 
Tribunal(s) having jurisdiction under the IPO Act. Section 18(1) of the IPO 
Act unequivocally proclaims that all suits and other civil proceedings 
regarding infringement of intellectual property laws shall be instituted and 
tried in the Tribunal, whereas, Section 18(2) thereof starts with the non-
obstante clause and clarifies that notwithstanding anything contained in 
any other law for the time being in force, the Tribunal shall have exclusive 
jurisdiction to try any offence under intellectual property laws, thereby, 
reinforcing the principle enshrined in Section 15 thereof which states that  
notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in 
force, an accused shall be tried and prosecuted for an offence in the 
Tribunal. Section 19 relates to appeals and grants the right to any person 
aggrieved by the final judgment or order of the Tribunal to prefer an appeal 
to the High Court having territorial jurisdiction over the Tribunal. Section 
39 of the IPO Act undoubtedly accepts the preemptive nature of the IPO 
Act by stating that its provisions shall have effect, notwithstanding 

11 
 
 
 
 
F. A. O. No. 46541 / 2022 
 
 
anything inconsistent therewith, contained in any other law for the time 
being in force.  
14. 
 
Therefore, it is vividly evident that purpose of the IPO Act as 
a subsequent enactment to all other intellectual property laws included in 
its Schedule is to regulate all such laws under the umbrella of the IPO. 
Another inevitable result derived from its examination is that multiple 
forums to adjudicate civil rights and offences under the existing 
intellectual property laws were eliminated and consolidated by way of 
vesting conclusive jurisdiction in respect thereof in the Tribunal in terms 
of Section 18 of the IPO Act read with Section 39 thereof with a right of 
appeal before the concerned High Court. The conspicuous absence and 
presence of non-obstante clause in Sections 18(1) and 18(2) of the IPO 
Act, respectively, implies that dedicated forums under intellectual property 
laws competent to adjudicate civil proceedings not involving questions of 
infringement of intellectual property laws can still decide such cases but in 
case of civil proceedings, wholly or partly, involving determination of any 
allegation of infringement of intellectual property laws, such forum will be 
divested of its jurisdiction which will vest in the Tribunal. On the other 
hand, the Tribunal will have absolute jurisdiction to try any offence under 
Section 18(2) of the IPO Act. Hence, the Copyright Ordinance must be 
construed subservient and subordinate to the provisions of the IPO Act to 
the extent that the latter explicitly or impliedly repeals the former. For 
example, the Copyright Ordinance establishes an independent Copyright 
Office under the control and superintendence of the Registrar of 
Copyrights but the IPO Act explicitly integrates the Copyright Office with 
the Trade Mark Registry and Patent Office established under different 
prior enactments and integrates them with the IPO vesting regulatory 
powers in the latter. Similarly, there is no ambiguity that jurisdiction of all 
forums with respect to all suits and civil proceedings regarding 
infringement of intellectual property laws and that of Magistrate qua 
offences under the Copyright Ordinance was clearly taken away by the 
IPO Act by vesting jurisdiction regarding the same with the Tribunal. 

12 
 
 
 
 
F. A. O. No. 46541 / 2022 
 
 
15. 
 
The riddle that now seeks resolution is how the jurisdiction of 
the Copyright Board under Section 41(2) of the Copyright Ordinance to 
rectify entries in the Copyright Register was affected by the IPO Act as a 
subsequent legislation vesting exclusive jurisdiction to the Tribunal to 
adjudicate all suits and civil proceedings regarding infringement of 
intellectual property laws. The most relevant case in this respect is that of 
Shaheen Chemist (supra) which explored the jurisdiction of the Tribunal 
under the IPO Act vis-à-vis the power of revocation of registration of 
Trade Mark, invalidity of registration of Trade Mark and suits of 
infringement of Trade Mark or any right emanating therefrom in terms of 
Sections 73, 80 and 117, respectively of the Trade Marks Ordinance. 
Sections 73 and 80 of the Trade Marks Ordinance also confers jurisdiction 
to the Registrar appointed under the Trademark Ordinance to hear and 
decide matters regarding revocation and invalidity of registration of Trade 
Marks apart from the jurisdiction vested in different Courts under specified 
conditions. The High Court undertook a comparative analysis of the IPO 
Act with the Trade Marks Ordinance in the light of case law and opined 
that use of word ‘infringement’ in Section 18(1) of the IPO Act is used in 
ordinary dictionary meaning as the term is not defined in the IPO Act 
which implies that the Tribunal under the IPO Act has the exclusive 
jurisdiction regarding all actions for breach and infringement of various 
provisions of intellectual property laws, as such, all such suits and 
proceedings fall within jurisdiction of the Tribunal alone. It was further 
held that the legislative intent in promulgating the IPO Act is that there 
should not be piecemeal adjudication qua breach or infringement of 
intellectual property rights, rather, the same should be conclusively and 
completely adjudicated by one forum which intent is manifest from 
Section 18 read with Section 39 of the IPO Act. As such, the doctrine of 
implied repeal was invoked based on the principles of interpretation 
endorsed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in case titled, “Messrs Federal 
Bank for Cooperatives versus Commissioner of Income Tax, Companies 
Zone” (2021 PTD 1203) to hold that all suits and other proceedings 

13 
 
 
 
 
F. A. O. No. 46541 / 2022 
 
 
involving infringement of intellectual property rights seeking enforcement 
of statutory remedies provided under intellectual property laws 
incorporated in the Schedule of the IPO Act will include such cases 
regarding revocation or invalidity of registration of Trade Marks under the 
Trade Marks Ordinance and fall within the competence and jurisdiction of 
the Tribunal under the IPO Act. 
16. 
 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan in case titled, “Muhammad 
Multazam Raza versus Muhammad Ayub Khan and others” (2022 SCMR 
979) while dilating upon the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribunal 
remarked that suit alleging infringement of Trade Mark accompanied with 
allegation of passing off would also fall within the domain of the Tribunal. 
In this context, it was observed that a passing off action may either be a 
passing off action simpliciter or an action of infringement of Trade Mark 
coupled with passing off. The second category of cases would fall within 
the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, notwithstanding that allegations in the suit 
were coupled with the allegation of passing off. The same principle was 
enunciated by the Sindh High Court in case titled, “Mahile Engine 
Components Japan Corporation versus Azam Autos and others” (Suit No. 
2058 of 2019), wherein, it was held that the Tribunal under the IPO Act is 
empowered to deal with all matters relating to intellectual property laws 
which shall include matters relating to intellectual property rights in an 
integrated manner and for matters concerned therewith or incidental 
therewith, as such, it is not permissible to file a claim before another forum 
under such laws, a part whereof, is based on allegation of infringement of 
an intellectual property right under such laws since in such an eventuality, 
the purpose of providing a specialized forum to decide such disputes under 
the IPO Act would be lost. 
17. 
 
The above analysis leads to consider as to how and to what 
extent, the provisions of Section 41(2) of the Copyright Ordinance can be 
reconciled with the IPO Act by harmonious construction of both statutes. 
Conversely, to what extent, the provisions of Section 41(2) of the 
Copyright Ordinance are so inconsistent with the IPO Act that the former 

14 
 
 
 
 
F. A. O. No. 46541 / 2022 
 
 
under the doctrine of implied repeal have to give way to the latter to 
prevail. For the purposes of reconciliation of Section 41(2) of the 
Copyright Ordinance with the IPO Act, all cases of rectification can be 
conveniently divided into two categories. The first category of cases is of 
rectification simpliciter, being not based on any allegation of infringement 
or breach of any other intellectual property right under intellectual property 
laws included in the Schedule of the IPO Act. The second category of 
cases is of rectification based on any allegation of infringement or breach 
of any other intellectual property right under intellectual property laws 
included in the Schedule of the IPO Act. The determination of rectification 
cases by the Copyright Board falling in the first category does not create 
any inconsistency with the jurisdiction of the Tribunal under the IPO Act 
which can be conveniently decided by the Copyright Board. However, 
there is an obvious and irreconcilable inconsistency with respect to second 
class of cases of rectification based on allegations of infringement of any 
existing intellectual property right under intellectual property laws 
included in the Schedule of the IPO Act. Therefore, it is safely concluded 
that where a rectification application contains allegations of infringement 
or breach of intellectual property rights under intellectual property laws 
included in the Schedule of the IPO Act, the jurisdiction to decide such an 
application would vest with the Tribunal in terms of Sections 17, 18 and 39 
of the IPO Act. 
18. 
 
The above finding obligates to discover nature of claim of the 
Respondents against the Appellant put forward in the rectification 
application. It is not the case of the Respondents that due procedural 
process was not followed by the Registrar of Copyrights while granting 
copyright of the Poetry Book to the Appellant, rather, the Respondents 
primarily assert that while granting copyright to the Appellant, the contents 
of the Poetry Book were not properly scrutinized, the Poetry Book did not 
consist of authentic and original work of the Appellant and the same 
contains plagiarized and copied content of other authors and singers. In the 
written objections filed on behalf of the Respondents, it has been admitted 

15 
 
 
 
 
F. A. O. No. 46541 / 2022 
 
 
by the Respondents in para No. 5 thereof that the Appellant has stolen, 
infringed and plagiarized the music, songs, poetry, poems and ghazals of 
other writers, poets and singers including Shaukat Ali (singer), Akhtar 
Hussain (poet), Allah Ditta Khakhi (poet) and Inayat Ali (poet), as such, 
others are victim of the Appellant. These poets, singers and musicians have 
sold their intellectual property rights to the Respondents, therefore, no one 
could be more aggrieved from the act of registration of copyright in favour 
of the Appellant than the Respondents because the said act of the Appellant 
has directly affected the music business of the Respondents. Hence, the 
copyright was erroneously granted to the Appellant which is liable to be 
rectified by way of cancellation and expunction. The record also depicts 
that the Appellant has filed declaratory suits before the Tribunal seeking 
various declarations against the Respondents in which one of the issues 
under adjudication is as to whether the Appellant holds copyright qua his

Respondents seeking cancellation of entry of copyright made in favour of 
the Appellant, in essence, is not rectification simpliciter but is based on 
allegations of infringement and breach of intellectual property rights of 
other authors and singers allegedly protected under intellectual property 
laws included in the Schedule of the IPO Act which could not be 
determined without deciding such allegations of infringement of 
intellectual property rights. Needless to reiterate that the jurisdiction to 
decide such a rectification application coupled with allegations of breach of 
intellectual property rights under intellectual property laws included in the 
Schedule of the IPO Act exclusively rests with the Tribunal created and 
existing under the IPO Act.
