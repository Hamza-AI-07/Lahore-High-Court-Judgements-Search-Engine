MASUD ABID NAQVI, J.  
Brief 
facts 
necessary 
for 
the 
adjudication of this lis are that the appellants/applicants filed an 
application under Section 11 of Punjab Waqf Properties Ordinance, 
1979 before the learned District Court with the averments that 
disputed land was leased out to Syed Hussain Shah as “Patta 
Dawami” and the disputed land was sold to the appellants through 
different sale deeds. The appellants/applicants constructed buildings 
on the disputed land and are owners in possession of disputed land.

Aggrieved from Notification dated 20.01.2010, issued by District 
Manager, Auqaf, Kasur wherein the land was declared as Auqaf’s 
land, the appellants/applicants filed  an application seeking 
declaration that disputed land is not a Waqf Land. The respondents 
filed replies to the application and raised legal as well as factual 
objections. Issues were framed and contesting parties led their 
respective oral as well as documentary evidence. After hearing the 
arguments advanced by both the parties, the learned District Court 
vide order and decree dated 10.03.2021 dismissed the application of 
appellants/applicants. Feeling aggrieved, the appellants/applicants 
preferred instant appeal and challenged the validity of the impugned 
order & decree passed by the learned District Court.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the appellants argues that appellants are 
lessee of Central Government and Auqaf Department cannot claim 
the land/ properties purchased by the appellants through sale deeds 
and infact sale deeds were/are just transfer of lease holding rights 
from Syed Hussain Shah who was perpetual lessee and in support of 
his arguments has also relied on cases reported as Auqaf 
Department through Chief Administrator Auqaf, Punjab Lahore 
Vs Secretary, Ministry of Religious Zakat, Ushar and Minorities 
Affairs Government of Pakistan, Islamabad and 3 others (2009 
SCMR 210), Chief Administrator Auqaf and others Vs Diwan 
Sheikh Taj-ud-Din and others (PLD 2012 Supreme Court 897), 

       F.A.O. No. 29323 of 2021

Chief Administrator Auqaf Vs Allah Bakhsh (decd) through LRs 
and another (2011 SCMR 235), Muhammad Hussain Vs Chief 
Administrator Auqaf, Punjab, Lahore and 2 others (2009 
Y.L.R.911(Lahore) and Mueen-Ud-Din and 8 others Vs 
Administrator General of Auqaf, Pakistan, Islamabad and 
another (PLD 2007 (Lahore) 583).  While learned counsel for 
Auqaf Department argues that sale deeds in favour of the appellants 
do not confer any ownership rights to the appellants and sale 
transactions were simply result of fraud committed by the appellants 
in connivance with officials and land in dispute is "ربقاتسن رساےئ "ہیکت اج  لگی, 
attached with Shrine of Hazrat Baba Bhullay Shah.  Further argues 
that only Auqaf Department has claim on the disputed 
land/properties and neither the Central Government nor Provincial 
Government is claiming the Auqaf land and under Section 7 of 
Ordinance, Chief Administrator Auqaf has the authority to take over 
waqf property by a notification. Waqf property is duly defined in 
Section 2 (e) of the Punjab Waqf Properties Ordinance, 1979.   
Learned Addl. Advocate General has also supported the claim of the 
Auqaf Department and has relied on plethora of judgments including 
the case of Government of Sindh and others Vs Muhammad Shafi 
and others (PLD 2015 SC 380).

3. 
I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the 
contesting parties as well as the learned law officers and perused the 
available record as well as the impugned order and decree. 
4. 
On 20.02.2024, learned counsel for the appellants recorded his 
statement before this Court which is reproduced hereunder;   
“Learned counsel for the appellants states that the 
predecessor- in-interest of the appellants namely Shah 
Hussain was a lessee of Central Government and the sale 
deeds executed in favour of the appellants were simply a 
transfer of the lease holding rights to the appellants and the 
predecessor-in-interest of the appellants was a perpetual 
lessee to the extent of 04 kanals 18 marlas and 445 Sqr, Ft….”    
 
There is a clear deviation in stance taken by the appellants/ 
applicants from posing themselves as owners in possession of 
buildings on the disputed land originally taken in plaint to holders of 
lease rights and the appellants are also claiming the lessee of Central 
Government. Although, only in Mark-C/register patta dar dawami 
maintained by Improvement Trust Kasur, words "تیکلم ہٹپ دار دوایم" are 
written and by heavily relying on Mark-C, learned counsel for 
appellants/applicants argues that disputed land was perpetually 
leased out to original lessee i.e. Syed Hussain Shah by Improvement 
Trust Kasur and is not attached to shrine of Hazrat Baba Bhullay 
Shah as waqf land. Now question arises that whether there exists a 
perpetual lease in favour of original lessee i.e. Syed Hussain Shah or 
not and for ascertaining & adjudging this question if a particular 
lease is perpetuity or otherwise, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 

       F.A.O. No. 29323 of 2021

Pakistan in a case reported as Government of Sindh and others Vs 
Muhammad Shafi and others (PLD 2015 SC 380) held that:- 
………After the enforcement of the two enactments referred to 
above, however, the question of determination of whether a 
lease is one in perpetuity or not stands simplified. Section 17 
of the Registration Act ibid mandates certain instruments to be 
compulsorily registerable and subsection (d) of section 17 
provides in the list of such documents “a lease of immoveable 
property from year to year, or for any term exceeding one 
year, or reserving a yearly rent.” The effect of non-
registration of such instruments is provided by Section 49 of 
the Registration Act in the manner: -  
 
“49. Effect of non-registration of documents required to 
be registered.—No document required to be registered 
under this Act or under any earlier law providing for or 
relating to registration of documents shall— 
(a)   Operate to create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish,  
whether in present or in future, any right, title or interest 
whether vested or contingent, or in immovable property, or 
(b) Confer any power to adopt, unless it has been 
registered.” 
 
 
Similarly it is clear from Section 107 of TPA that a 
lease of any property beyond one year could only be effected 
by a registered instrument (note:-subject to the exemption qua 
other leases orally made coupled with delivery of possession). 
This is the express and unequivocal mandate of the law. It is 
settled principle of law that whether law requires an act to be 
done in a particular manner, it has to be done accordingly 
and not otherwise. At this point, we may also add that if an act 

       F.A.O. No. 29323 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
6
is done in violation of law, the same shall have no legal value 
and sanctity, especially when the conditions/circumstances 
which may render such an act invalid have been expressly and 
positively specified in law (see section 49 ibid)……….. 
 
By simply perusing Mark-C/register patta dar dawami 
maintained by Improvement Trust Kasur, words "تیکلم ہٹپ دار دوایم" are 
written and land is described as "ربقاتسن رساےئ ریغ پ نک اج  لگی": allocated for 
outsiders Zaireen & graveyard Peer Jungli Wala as per the record 
which clearly indicates the intention of authorities about the use of 
land. Therefore, there remains no doubt that the lease was/is neither 
perpetual lease in favour of original lessee i.e. Syed Hussain Shah 
nor transferable and can only be used for religious purposes. 
5. 
The lease of immovable property is defined under Section 105 
of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 which regulates and 
determines the relationship of lessor and lessee and unambiguously 
stipulates that lease of immovable property is a transfer of a right to 
enjoy such property, made for certain time, express or implied, or in 
perpetuity in consideration of price paid or promised and the 
transferor is called lessor, the transferee is called lessee, price is 
called the premium and money, share of crops, service or any other 
thing of value to be rendered periodically or on specified occasion to 
the transferor by the transferee.   So, the essential features of lease 
are the transfer of interest to enjoy property with exclusive 

       F.A.O. No. 29323 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
7
possession by the transferor to the transferee for certain time or in 
perpetuity for consideration of price paid or promised etc. Learned 
counsel for the appellants/applicants argues about the perpetual lease 
but neither in arguments or in application under Section 11 of the 
Punjab Waqf Properties Ordinance, 1979 nor during the recording of 
examination in chief of AW-1 & AW-2, any consideration either 
paid or promised to be paid by the original lessee or subsequent lease 
holders was argued/pleaded/deposed which is a basic requirement of 
lease. 
6. 
One of the appellant/applicant namely Tahir Saeed appeared 
as AW-1 & produced private witness namely Saeed Ilyas as AW-2 
while rest of the two AWs were government officials. Tahir 
Saeed/AW-1 & Saeed Ilyas/ AW-2  supported the contents of 
application in examination in chief but in cross-examination, both 
the witnesses neither had the exact knowledge about the ownership 
of Syed Hussain Shah on the disputed land nor the terms of perpetual 
lease. Relevant portion of cross-examination of Tahir Saeed/AW-1 is 
reproduced hereunder;

7. 
The learned District Court has properly appreciated the 
contents of the application and has also discussed in detail statements 
of AW’s & RW’s on the basis of documents exhibited by both sides 

       F.A.O. No. 29323 of 2021

and thereafter reached at the correct conclusion regarding the 
controversy.  The impugned order and decree do not suffer from any 
infirmity, legal or factual, requiring interference, therefore, this 
appeal is dismissed.
