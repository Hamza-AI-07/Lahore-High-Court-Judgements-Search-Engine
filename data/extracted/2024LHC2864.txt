MUHAMMAD 
SAJID 
MEHMOOD 
SETHI, 
J.: 
Through instant petition, petitioner has assailed vires of order 
dated 02.3.2024 passed by learned Addl. District Judge, Sialkot, 
whereby application of respondent No.1 for amendment of the 
pleadings was allowed and consequently, Trial Court’s 
consolidated judgment and decree dated 30.03.2003 was set aside 
and matter was remanded.  
2. 
Briefly stated the facts of the case are that respondent  
No.1 instituted two suits: (i) suit for declaration along with 
permanent injunction against petitioner; (ii) suit for declaration 
for permanent injunction against respondents No.2 to 8. In the 
first suit, he contended that he was owner in possession of 
property measuring 51 Kanals 15 Marlas described in Khewat 
No.57, Khatooni Nos.159, 160, 329 and 331, Khasra No.868/613, 
865/612, 605, 606, 618, 619, 620, 180, 761/1/9, 762/189, 
164/910, 609, 142 as per Record of Rights for the years of 2010-
11 situated at Village Dulekhiki and petitioner Iftikhar Ahmed 
had no connection with it; that respondent No.1 constructed a 
boundary wall over above said property, dividing it into two parts 

2 
C.R. No.20763 of 2024 
with a kacha path; that petitioner had already occupied some land 
of the aforementioned property on the bank of Chenab river and 
intended to raise construction over it and further sell it out by 
showing himself as owner; and that petitioner was repeatedly 
asked not to interfere with the suit property but he refused. In the 
second suit for declaration alongwith permanent injunction, he 
alleged that respondent No.2/Mureed Hussain raised construction 
over suit property even in presence of status quo order, without 
any lawful authority. Both the suits were consolidated, and the 
learned Trial Court vide consolidated judgment and decree dated 
30.3.2023 dismissed the suits as they did not meet the parameters 
of Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877. Feeling aggrieved, 
respondent No. 1 filed an appeal before the learned Addl. District 
Judge, Sialkot. He also filed an application for amendment of the 
pleadings, which was accepted by the learned Addl. District 
Judge and consolidated judgment and decree of the Trial Court 
was set aside vide order dated 02.3.2024 and the matter was 
remanded back to the Trial Court with the direction that both the 
suits shall be deemed to be pending and the Trial Court shall 
proceed with the suits in accordance with law after receiving 
amended pleadings.  
3. 
Learned counsel for petitioner submits that possession 
of the petitioner was admitted even prior to institution of the 
suits because complaints filed by respondent No.1 under the 
provisions of Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005, had failed. He 
further submits that the application was barred by limitation and 
not maintainable. He further submits that the amendment of the 
pleadings would change nature and character of the suits. 
Reliance is placed on Saddaruddin (since deceased) through 
LRs v. Sultan Khan (since deceased) through LRs and others 
(2021 SCMR 642) and Sultan Muhammad and another v. 
Muhammad Qasim and others (2010 SCMR 1630).

Heard. Available record perused. 
5.  
Respondent No.1 instituted a suit for declaration and 
permanent injunction alleging ownership and possession over 
the suit property and sought amendment in the pleadings by 
contending that his peaceful possession was snatched during 
pendency of the suits. The addition of relief of possession in 
view of alleged development cannot be termed as setting up of a 
new case. In fact, the factum of dispossession gels well with 
other facts contained in the plaints. By no stretch of imagination, 
it can be considered a change in the nature and complexion of 
the suit. The natural result of declaration if succeed would be 
that consequential relief has to be given by the Court even same 
was not claimed and the Court in such circumstances is bound to 
call upon the party to amend the plaint to the extent of 
possession and direct him to pay the Court-fee. Reliance is 
placed on Mst. Arshan Bi through Mst. Fatima Bi and others v. 
Maula Bakhsh through Mst. Ghulam Safoor and others (2003 
SCMR 318), Altaf Hussain alias Mushtaq Ahmed v. Muhammad 
Din and others (2010 CLC 1646), Asif Hussain and another v. 
Mst. Bakho alias Bakhto (deceased) through Legal Heirs (2021 
YLR 573), Khalid & Company through Proprietor v. 
Cantonment Board, Malir through President, Commander 
Station Headquarter, Malir Cantonment and Cantonment 
Executive Officer, Karachi (PLD 2002 Karachi 502) and 
Muhammad Anwar and another v. Additional District Judge, 
Toba Tek Singh and 4 others (2012 CLC 1976).  
  
In Muhammad Mian v. Syed Shamimullah and 2 others 
(1995 SCMR 69), a Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has 
rendered following observations:-  
“The application has been contested by the respondents. 
It has been stated that the, application has been filed 
after long delay. The suit was filed in the year 1979, but 
the relief of possession was not claimed, therefore, the 
application for amendment may not be allowed at this 
belated stage. The amendment claimed by the 

4 
C.R. No.20763 of 2024 
petitioner will not alter the nature of the suit or 
relief. The relief of possession is a consequential 
relief for declaration. This relief arises out of the 
claim of the appellant. The amendment sought by 
the appellant is only of technical nature. No further 
evidence is required. In' Ahmad Din v. Muhammad 
Shafi (PLD 1971 SC 762) it has been observed that 
"the suit could not fail merely by reason of fact that 
consequential relief by way of possession had not 
been 
claimed. 
If 
the 
suit 
was 
otherwise 
maintainable and the appellant was otherwise 
entitled to the relief it was open to the Courts to 
allow him to amend the plaint by adding a prayer 
for possession and paying the appropriate ad 
valorem court-fees." In Zubaida Bibi v. Hashmat Bibi 
(1993 SCMR 1882) the prayer for amendment of plaint 
was allowed. We, therefore, allow the amendment at the 
cost. of Rs.5,000. The appellant shall pay ad valorem 
court-fee. As regards the question of limitation, the High 
Court has dismissed the petition on the ground that the 
revision petition was filed after the lapse of about 12 
months. The High Court itself observed that no period of 
limitation is prescribed for filing revision application, but it 
can only be filed within a reasonable time.” 
  
 
6. 
Needless to say that an amendment in pleadings may 
be allowed where it avoids multiplicity of suits, does not alter 
the subject matter or cause of action, does not take away any 
accrued right, entitles the plaintiff to further relief due to 
subsequent events, amplifies the cause of action, serves the 
interests of justice, triggers a new statutory line of defense due 
to the plaintiff’s evidence, causes no injustice, or addresses an 
inadvertently omitted relief. However, this list is not exhaustive. 
Order VI, Rule 17, C.P.C. contemplates that the Court may at 
any stage of the proceedings allow the parties to alter or 
amend the pleadings in such manner as may be just and all 
amendments which may be necessary for the purpose of 
determining the real question in controversy between them. It 
is settled rule that the application under Order VI, Rule 17, 
C.P.C. can be entertained and allowed at any stage of the 
proceedings if the same is necessary for effective decision 
thereof. Moreover amendment can be allowed while ignoring 

5 
C.R. No.20763 of 2024 
delay whatsoever, even at any stage of proceedings in the trial, 
and in certain cases amendments can be permitted at the stage 
of appeal or even in the revisional jurisdiction, however, 
keeping in view the beneficial rule, that proposed amendment 
is expedient for the purpose of determining the real questions 
in controversy between the parties and it is not changing the 
nature of pleadings. An alteration in the relief does not 
ordinarily change the character or substance of the suit if it is 
based on the same averments, and if such an amendment is 
allowed, no injustice could be done to the other party. It is 
also well-established tenet that pursuant to Order VI, Rule 17 
CPC, amendments to pleadings are permissible at any juncture 
of the legal proceedings, provided they serve to crystallize the 
substantive 
issues 
at 
hand 
without 
transmuting 
the 
fundamental character of the original pleadings. Reliance is 
placed on Muhammad Saleem Naseem v. Additional District 
Judge, Dunyapur and 12 others (2021 CLC 87) and Ahmed 
Bakhsh v. Imam Bakhsh and others (2023 CLC 1076). 
7. 
Learned counsel for petitioner has failed to point out 
any illegality, material irregularity or jurisdictional defect in the 
impugned order, hence, no interference in exercise of revisional 
jurisdiction is warranted. 
8.  
For what has been discussed above, this petition being 
devoid of any merits is dismissed.
