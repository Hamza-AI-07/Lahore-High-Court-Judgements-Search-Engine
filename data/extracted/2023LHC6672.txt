Mr. Hussain Tahir Zaidi, Advocate 
 
 
Anwaar Hussain J: This appeal under Section 96 of the Code 
of Civil Procedure, 1908 (“the CPC”) is directed against the 
judgment and decree dated 30.01.2019 passed by the learned 
Additional District Judge, Lahore, whereby the suit instituted by Mst. 
Undlas 
Begum 
widow 
of 
Muhammad 
Riaz 
Sheikh 
(“the 
respondent”) was decreed and she was held entitled to the recovery 
of insurance coverage of Rs.600,000/-, under the self-subscribed 
group insurance scheme, alongwith interest @ 5% higher than the 
then bank rate from the death of husband of the respondent till 
realization, with cost in accordance with Section 47-B of the 
Insurance Act, 1938 (“Insurance Act”).   
FACTUAL BACKGROUND: 
2. 
Husband of the respondent was employee of the State Life 
Insurance Corporation of Pakistan (“the appellant”) and retired as 
Deputy Manager on 02.05.1997. Thereafter, he was engaged as Sales 

R.F.A No.16370/2019 
2
Manager by the appellant, on 04.05.1997. The appellant had already 
entered into a State Life Group Insurance Memorandum of 
Understanding dated 01.10.1995 (“MOU”) with the State Life Field 
Workers Federation of Pakistan, to be effective from 01.07.1994, and 
as per the terms of the MOU, a voluntary self-subscribed additional 
group insurance scheme was introduced for the benefit of the Sales 
Managers, the Sales Officers and the Sales Representatives. In terms 
of the MOU, the Sales Representatives were eligible for coverage 
provided they had completed at least Rs.15,000/- (Rs.10,000 after 
amendment) First Year Premium (FYP) during the previous calendar 
year. The Sales Officers and the Sales Managers were to be 
automatically included in the scheme. All eligible persons over the 
age of 60 years were required to submit medical evidence of good 
health for inclusion in the scheme. Per the terms of the MOU, the 
Sales Managers, like the husband of the respondent, were provided a 
group insurance coverage of Rs.600,000/-.   
3. 
Husband of the respondent died on 24.04.2002. The respondent 
filed the claim for providing group insurance coverage of 
Rs.600,000/-, in terms of the MOU, however, on 16.03.2009, the said 
claim was rejected/repudiated by the appellant, on the ground that 
deceased husband of the respondent did not procure required quota of 
business and, hence, his coverage was discontinued by the appellant. 
On 23.08.2010, the respondent filed an application before the 
Insurance Tribunal (“the Tribunal”) established under the Insurance 
Ordinance, 2000 (“the Ordinance”). The appellant objected to the 
jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the matter remained pending. In the 
meanwhile, in some other insurance matters involving issue related to 
the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in respect of claims arising under the 
Insurance Act, after pronouncement of the judgment by a learned Full 
Bench of this Court reported as “Mst. Robina Bibi v. State Life 
Insurance and others” (2013 CLD 477), plaint of the respondent’s 

R.F.A No.16370/2019 
3
suit was returned by the Tribunal, in terms of Order VII, Rule 10 of 
the CPC, vide order dated 10.06.2013, on the ground that claims 
arising out of the insurance policies issued prior to the commencement 
of the Ordinance are to be heard by the Ordinary Courts, under the 
Insurance Act, and not by the Tribunal established under the 
Ordinance. It is pertinent to observe that the parties before the learned 
Full Bench of this Court approached the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan and the appeals were dismissed on 04.02.2014 through a 
judgment cited as “Mst. Naseem Begum and others v. State Life 
Insurance Corporation of Pakistan and others” (2014 SCMR 655). 
However, while the appeal(s) of other claimants were pending before 
the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case of Mst. Naseem supra, the 
respondent also preferred Insurance Appeal bearing No.704/2013 
(“the appeal”), before this Court, against order dated 10.06.2013, 
passed by the Tribunal, returning her plaint. The appeal remained 
pending for approximately three and half years and when it was taken 
up by a learned Division Bench of this Court, vide order dated 
07.11.2016, the appeal was disposed of as withdrawn, permitting the 
respondent to approach the relevant Court for redressal of her 
grievance and the time period spent before this Court in terms of 
pendency of the appeal was condoned. Thereafter, a fresh suit was 
instituted, by the respondent, under the Insurance Act alongwith an 
application under Sections 14 and 19 of the Limitation Act, 1908 
(“Limitation Act”), which was decreed through the impugned 
judgment.  
ARGUMENTS: 
4. 
Mr. Ibrar Ahmed, learned counsel for the appellant submits 
since the case of the respondent was to be dealt with under the 
Insurance Act, therefore, once husband of the respondent died on 
24.04.2002, the limitation period envisaged under Article 86(a) of the 
Limitation Act expired on 23.04.2005 and hence, the claim was barred 

R.F.A No.16370/2019 
4
by time, having been filed in the Tribunal on 23.08.2010. Adds that 
instead of waiting for the repudiation/rejection letter, the respondent 
should have filed the claim before the relevant forum i.e., (ordinary 
Courts under the Insurance Act) within three years after the death of 
the insured. Elaborating his objection, places reliance on case reported 
as “Messrs Pak Suzuki Motors Company Limited through Manager v. 
Faisal Jameel Butt and another” (PLD 2023 Supreme Court 482) to 
contend that the entire exercise of filing a claim with the appellant 
followed by the institution of case in the Court must be completed 
within 03 years’ time, envisaged under Article 86(a) of the Limitation 
Act. Further contends that even if the time limitation is to be reckoned 
from the date of repudiation of the claim by the appellant, the suit was 
time barred as the repudiation letter is dated 16.03.2009 and the 
respondent filed the case with the Tribunal on 23.08.2010 that was a 
wrong forum and hence, her plaint was rightly retuned and when the 
appeal of the respondent was disposed of as withdrawn, the period 
spent before this Court in the said appeal was specifically excluded by 
the learned Division Bench and not the time period spent before the 
Tribunal, therefore, the Trial Court erred in decreeing the time barred 
claim of the respondent while applying doctrine of merger in the 
terms that the order of Tribunal, dated 10.06.2013 returning the plaint 
of the respondent merged into the order of withdrawal of the appeal. 
Further contends that even otherwise, instead of presenting the same 
plaint/suit in the proper Court, fresh suit was filed by the respondent 
that was patently time barred and also negates provision of Order 
XXIII, CPC. Adds that the application for condonation/exclusion of 
the said time period was filed by the respondent but the decision was 
deferred by the Trial Court, vide order dated 24.07.2017, observing 
that the same can only be decided after recording of evidence, 
however, no specific finding in this regard has been rendered and, 
hence, question of limitation has not been touched upon and the 
impugned findings are liable to be set aside.  

R.F.A No.16370/2019

5. 
Further contends that the time limitation once commenced 
cannot be stopped and even if this Court intends to decide the 
limitation issue in the present proceedings, the time spent before the 
wrong forum, on the basis of wrong advice of a counsel, cannot be 
excluded and places reliance on the cases reported as “Water and 
Power Development Authority v. Aurangzeb” (1998 SCMR 1354); 
“Abdul Majeed and another v. Ghulam Haider and others” (2001 
SCMR 1254); “Furqan Habib and others v. Government of Pakistan 
and others” (2006 SCMR 460) and “Syed Athar Hussain Shah v. Haji 
Muhammad Riaz and another” (2022 SCMR 778). 
6. 
As regards the merits of the case, learned counsel for the 
appellant submits that except for PW-1, no supporting witness has 
appeared to substantiate the claim of the respondent as to whether the 
deceased husband of the respondent fulfilled the threshold criteria 
entitling the deceased for the group insurance. Further adds that had 
the impugned decree been passed to the extent of the amount claimed 
i.e., Rs.600,000/- only, the appellant would not have challenged the 
same but since compound interest has been awarded, for the period 
that was spent by the respondent herself before wrong forums till the 
date of realization, therefore, the present appeal has been preferred. 
Adds that such finding could not have been rendered as it is settled 
principle of law that in cases granting the compound interest or un-
liquidated damages, specific issue is to be framed; evidence is to be 
led; and on the strength of the same only a just decision can be passed 
and in this regard places reliance on the case reported as “Askari 
General Insurance Company Limited through President/Chief 
Executive Officer v. Islam Lubricants (Pvt.) Limited through Director 
and 2 others” (2022 CLD 425). 
7. 
Conversely, Mr. Liaqat Ali Butt, learned counsel for the 
respondent submits that the crucial date is not the date of death of 
husband of the respondent but the date when the claim was repudiated 

R.F.A No.16370/2019 
6
i.e., 16.03.2009. Adds that the respondent approached the Tribunal 
within time and, hence, she cannot be non-suited, merely, because of 
pendency of the proceedings before the Tribunal followed by 
proceedings before the learned Division Bench of this Court inasmuch 
as the respondent acted in good faith, since by that time, the 
Ordinance had been promulgated whereby the Insurance Act had been 
repealed and there was genuine confusion as to the appropriate forum 
and Trial Court has correctly applied doctrine of merger to condone 
the delay. Places reliance on the case reported as “State Life Insurance 
Corporation of Pakistan through Chairman/Zonal Head/Attorney and 
others v. Mst. Razia Begum through Legal Heirs/Representative” 
(2022 CLD 1026). In respect of grant of the compound interest, 
learned counsel submits that since the appellant has wrongfully 
withheld the claim, therefore, the Trial Court was justified in granting 
the compound interest.   
8. 
Mr. Hussain Tahir Zaidi, Advocate, learned Amicus Curiae 
submits that the question of limitation needs to be examined while 
keeping in view the conduct of the insurer inasmuch the jurisprudence 
developed on the subject revolves around the same and the Courts 
have always mindfully considered this aspect and places reliance on 
cases reported as “Muhammad Asif and others v. State Life Insurance 
Corporation of Pakistan through Chairman and another” (2018 CLD 
239); “Jubilee General Insurance Co. Ltd., Karachi v. Ravi Steel 
Company, Lahore” (PLD 2020 SC 324) and “State Life Insurance 
Corporation and others v. Mst. Syeda Muzhara Fatima” (2021 CLD 
479). Adds that where the insurance company itself delayed the 
repudiation of the claim and period of three years envisaged under 
Article 86(a) of the Limitation Act elapsed, the claim of the insured 
person was held not to be time barred. Places reliance on case 
reported as State Life Insurance Corporation of Pakistan through 
Chairman/Zonal Head/Attorney and others supra.

Arguments heard. Record perused. 
 
POINTS OF DETERMINATION: 
i. 
 Whether the limitation period in terms of Article 
86(a) of the Limitation Act, is to commence from 
the date of death of the insured or from the rejection 
letter? 
ii. 
 Whether the case of the respondent was time 
barred?  
iii. 
 If the answer to second question is in affirmative, 
whether doctrine of merger can be applied by 
implication to condone the limitation, occasioned 
on account of time spent before the wrong forum 
keeping in view the fact that limitation is not a mere 
technicality? 
iv. 
 Whether this Court can condone the delay in 
present proceedings? 
v. 
 Whether the interest awarded on the claim of the 
respondent is void under the law? 
 
OPINION OF THE COURT: 
10. 
Before addressing the points of determination formulated 
hereinabove, it is to be kept in sight that the Limitation Act is a 
substantive law and has definite consequences on the rights and 
obligations of a party to arise. These principles should be adhered to 
and applied appropriately depending on the facts and circumstances of 
a given case as also the nature of the matter. Once a valuable right has 
accrued in favour of one party as a result of the failure of the other 
party to explain the delay by showing sufficient cause and its own 
conduct, it will be unreasonable rather unjustifiable to take away that 
right on the mere asking of the applicant, particularly, when the delay 
is directly a result of negligence, default or inaction of that party. If a 
party has been thoroughly negligent in implementing its rights and 
availing its remedies before the right forum, it will be equally unfair 

R.F.A No.16370/2019 
8
to deprive the other party of a valuable right that has accrued to it in 
law as a result of his acting vigilantly.  
11. 
At the same time, one cannot lose sight of the fact that the 
contracts of insurance are based on principle of uberrimae fidei, (of 
the utmost good faith) that had been developed over centuries by the 
common law and was regarded as fundamental to the insurance law. 
While Section 75 of the Ordinance has codified this principle, the 
same has been held applicable under the Insurance Act, albeit, without 
an equivalent or pari materia provision in the latter enactment. Case 
reported as “State Life Insurance Corporation of Pakistan v. Atta Ur 
Rehman” (2021 SCMR 1347) is referred in this regard.  
12. 
Having observed so in relation to the object of Limitation Act 
as also the nature of an insurance contract, I would advert to the first 
point of determination as to whether the claim of the respondent was 
time barred. The relevant provision of law is Article 86(a) of Part VI 
of the First Schedule of the Limitation Act, which reads as under:  
 
Description of suit 
Period of 
limitation 
Time 
from which 
period begins to run 
(a) On a policy of insurance 
when the sum insured is 
payable after proof of 
the death has been given 
to or received by the 
insurers 
Three 
years  
 
 
 
 
The date of the death 
of the deceased 
 
 
 
 
 
It is pertinent to note that neither under the Insurance Act nor under 
the Ordinance, any time frame has been envisaged for the insurer to 
accept or reject the claim of the insured and it has been a common 
practice for the insurers to reject the claim close to or even after the 
period of limitation provided under Article 86(a) of the Limitation 
Act. In the present case, the claim was repudiated seven years after the 
death of the husband of the respondent. Argument of learned counsel 
for the appellant that a claimant must approach the relevant forum 

R.F.A No.16370/2019 
9
within three years from the date when claim arises without waiting for 
the repudiation while placing reliance on case of Pak Suzuki Motors 
Company supra is misconceived inasmuch as the said case was related 
to the limitation period provided under the Punjab Consumer 
Protection Act, 2005 that is a special statute and not under the 
Limitation Act. Even otherwise, the contracts forming subject matter 
of the consumer protection laws are purely commercial in nature and 
not based on the doctrine of good faith (uberrimae fidei) as discussed 
hereinabove. Moreover, in said case, the Hon’ble Supreme Court held 
that the limitation period in consumer protection claims related to 
goods (defective) is more significant inasmuch as due to potential 
depreciation of the product in question and delay in the filing of the 
claim can lead to challenges in establishing the condition of the 
product at the time of purchase and linking any defects to the 
consumer’s use whereas in insurance claims, more particularly one 
before this Court, unless a claimant is aware of reasons for 
rejection/repudiation of his/her claim, filing of the suit under the law 
becomes meaningless. Therefore, mere fact that the appellant took 
seven years to reject the claim of the respondent based on simple 
service record of the deceased that was in the custody of the appellant 
belies logic as to what caused the delay for the appellant to reach the 
conclusion that the respondent’s claim is not payable and hence, the 
appellant cannot set up the defence on ground of limitation. Case of 
Jubilee General Insurance Co. Ltd., Karachi supra is referred in 
which the claim was barred by two months under Article 86(b) of the 
Limitation Act which is pari materia but applicable in cases of loss, 
however, the Supreme Court of Pakistan while referring to the 
principle of equitable estoppel decided that the plea of limitation 
cannot be raised in the light of the conduct of insurer. Similarly, in 
case of Muhammad Asif and others supra as also case reported as 
“State Life Insurance Corporation and others v. Mst. Syeda Muzhara 
Fatima” (2021 CLD 479), the Courts have put the principle of 

R.F.A No.16370/2019 
10
promoting the justice and equity at the forefront while deciding the 
matter in favour of the claimants. Hence, this Court is of the opinion 
that in the circumstances of the present case, the appellant cannot rely 
on the plea of limitation.  
13. 
Examining the question of limitation from date of initiation of 
the claim before the Tribunal on 23.08.2010 apparently, the claimant 
was before the wrong forum, hence, the plaint was returned under 
Order VII Rule 10, CPC, on 10.06.2013 after decision of the learned 
Full Bench of this Court dated 15.02.2013. An appeal was preferred 
before the learned Division Bench of this Court and the matter 
remained pending whereas simultaneously, the judgment of the 
learned Full Bench dated 15.02.2013 was also assailed in appeal 
before the Hon’ble Supreme Court in which leave was granted on 
23.06.2013 and finally, on 04.02.2014, the decision of the learned Full 
Bench was upheld through judgment cited as Mst. Naseem Begum and 
others supra. Thereafter, the appeal preferred by the respondent was 
withdrawn on 07.11.2016 in the following terms: 
“Learned counsel for the appellant would like to 
withdraw the instant appeal in order to seek remedy 
before the Court of competent jurisdiction. He, however, 
submits that a direction may be issued that if the 
appellant files the case before the Court of competent 
jurisdiction the same will be decided within a period of 
two months and further that while dealing with the 
question of limitation the time spent before this Court 
will be excluded from the period of limitation. Order 
accordingly. Disposed of.” 
(Emphasis supplied)  
The respondent filed a fresh suit on 19.12.2016 along with application 
under Section 14 read with Section 19 of the Limitation Act for 
condonation of delay and the said application was disposed of in the 
terms that the same was to be taken up at a later stage. However, when 
the final judgment was passed by the Trial Court, the issue was 
decided in favour of the respondent on the basis that this Court, vide 

R.F.A No.16370/2019 
11
order dated 07.11.2016, held that time spent before this Court was 
condoned.  
14. 
This Court is cognizant of the fact as well as legal position that 
since the learned Division Bench of this Court had no jurisdiction to 
entertain the matter on account of which the appeal had been 
withdrawn, therefore, in terms of dicta laid down in case cited as 
“Sahabzadi MAHARUNISA and another v. Mst. GHULAM 
SUGHRAN and another” (PLD 2016 SC 358), doctrine of merger 
cannot be applied. To this extent argument of learned counsel for the 
appellant has some force that the Trial Court erred in relying on case 
of Sahabzadi MAHARUNISA and another supra, however, it is also 
pertinent to note that the present case has peculiar facts and 
circumstances and principle of equitable estoppel, as discussed above, 
is applicable in relation to plea of limitation, in cases emanating from 
the insurance law. Moreover, the appellant never assailed the order 
dated 07.11.2016 passed by the learned Division Bench of this Court 
and hence, the same remained binding upon the Trial Court while 
deciding the present matter. The appellant, therefore, cannot object to 
the relief extended by the learned Division Bench of this Court by 
excluding the time spent before the said learned Bench inasmuch as it 
is settled principle of law that even a void order is required to be 
challenged by the aggrieved party. I am fortified by the law laid down 
by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case reported as “Kiramat Khan v. 
IG, Frontier Corps and others” (2023 SCMR 866) wherein it has 
been held as under: 
“6. 
….. this Court has repeatedly held that 
limitation would run even against a void order and 
an aggrieved party must approach the competent 
forum for redressal of his grievance within the 
period of limitation provided by law. This principle 
has consistently been upheld, affirmed and reaffirmed 
by this Court and is now a settled law on the subject. 
Reference in this regard may be made to Parvez 
Musharraf v. Nadeem Ahmed (Advocate) (PLD 2014 

R.F.A No.16370/2019 
12
SC 585) where a 14-member Bench of this Court 
approved the said Rule. Reference in this regard may 
also be made to Muhammad Sharif v. MCB Bank 
Limited (2021 SCMR 1158) and Wajdad v. 
Provincial Government (2020 SCMR 2046).” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
Therefore, this Court is of the opinion that in peculiar facts and 
circumstances of the case, the Trial Court was justified in relying 
upon the order dated 07.11.2016 passed by the learned Division 
Bench of this Court in allowing the condonation of delay. As far as 
the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that the learned 
Division Bench only condoned the time spent before the said Bench 
and the time spent before the Tribunal still remains unaccounted for, 
the same also fails to hold water as it would be anomalous that the 
time spent before appellate forum i.e., learned Division Bench of this 
Court is excluded and condoned as the appellant did not challenge 
order dated 07.11.2016 but the time spent before the Tribunal, the 
order whereof was challenged in appeal before the learned Division 
Bench of this Court, cannot be excluded and condoned by the Trial 
Court, particularly, when the learned Division Bench of this Court 
allowed the withdrawal of the appeal enabling the respondent to 
approach the competent forum in view of the legal position explicated 
by the learned Full Bench of this Court and upheld by the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court.  
15. 
The matter can be examined from another angle. This Court, in 
the interest of justice, is obligated to take into account the nature of 
the claim, the inordinate delay caused by the appellant in repudiating 
the claim of the respondent, applicability of principle of equitable 
estoppel in insurance matters, and the ambiguity that revolved around 
the jurisdiction of the ordinary Courts and/or the Tribunal, in terms of 
the provisions of the Insurance Act and the Ordinance, in respect of 
claims arising under the former statute to opine whether the delay, can 

R.F.A No.16370/2019 
13
be condoned by this Court, at the appellate stage, in the present 
proceedings. In this regard, this Court is cognizant of the fact that the 
condonation of delay is a matter of concession and cannot be claimed 
as a matter of absolute right. It is the existence of sufficient cause for 
not filing the proceeding in time before the proper forum that must be 
justified to the satisfaction of the Court to exercise its power of 
granting or refusing to grant the condonation of delay/extension of 
time. If the condition is not satisfied, there is no room for the 
applicability of the power to condone the delay. Thus, where no cause 
has, at all, been shown that is, where no explanation has been given 
for filing the proceeding out of time, there arises no opportunity of 
considering the sufficiency or otherwise of the reasons for that fact, 
and there cannot be any room for the exercise of the discretion given 
under the law. If the condition is satisfied, then the Court gets a 
discretionary power to grant or refuse the prayer for extension of time. 
What is sufficient cause, being a question of discretion, depends upon 
the facts and circumstances of a particular case. It is also worth 
mentioning that in terms of Section 107, CPC, this Court in appellate 
proceedings has the power to condone the delay, in view of the 
peculiar facts of a particular case and keeping in view bona fides of 
the claimant with reference to the delay occurred in filing the claim. 
16. 
Keeping in view the above discussion in respect of 
discretionary power of the Courts to condone delay, this Court is of 
the opinion that the learned Amicus Curiae rightly pointed out that in 
insurance matters, the conduct of the insurer to induce the claimant to 
wait for the decision and then refusal/repudiation of the claim at a 
belated stage provides the defence of equitable estoppel in respect of 
enforcement of Article 86(a) of the Limitation Act against the 
claimant, which has always been considered as pivotal in deciding the 
defence of limitation. Therefore, this Court ventures to analyse 
whether in the instant case, there is/was sufficient cause to condone 
the delay.  

R.F.A No.16370/2019

17. 
The respondent approached the appellant for the payment of the 
claim which was kept pending for more than 07 years and as observed 
hereinabove, it belies logic as to what caused the delay for the 
appellant to reach the conclusion that the respondent’s claim is not 
payable when the claim of the respondent was based on simple service 
record of the deceased that was in the custody of the appellant and 
factum of death was also reported in time. Once the claim was 
repudiated, the respondent acted in most bona fide manner and 
approached the Tribunal by filing the claim in time. The Tribunal was 
not the appropriate forum, however, time spent pursuing the claim 
and/or appeal before a wrong forum, in good faith and with due 
diligence in the opinion of this Court constitutes sufficient cause for 
condonation of delay. I am fortified by the law laid down in case 
reported as “Khushi Muhammad through L.Rs. and Others Versus 
Mst. Fazal Bibi and Others” (PLD 2016 Supreme Court 872), 
wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court held as under: 
“37……However, sufficient cause is a term wide 
enough to encompass within it the principles 
enshrined in Section 14 of the Act or indeed 
independent thereto. Time spent pursuing an 
appeal before a wrong forum, in good faith and 
with due diligence ought in our view to constitute 
sufficient cause for condonation of delay. But the 
act of approaching a wrong forum must be 
accounted for: It should be established that due to 
some honest, bona fide and genuine ambiguity in 
the law or in fact, a party or his counsel was led 
astray in terms of approaching a wrong forum.” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
Bona fide of the respondent and her counsel in pursuing the case 
before wrong forum gets traction by the fact that besides the 
respondent, there were other litigants and/or their counsel, on account 
of honest, bona fide and genuine ambiguity in the law or in fact, were 
led astray in terms of approaching the wrong forum (i.e., the Tribunal 
instead of District Court). Even this Court had to form a Full Bench to 

R.F.A No.16370/2019 
15
clear the mist surrounding the jurisdiction of Tribunal under the 
Ordinance and repeal of the Insurance Act and the ambiguity in 
relation to the jurisdiction of the relevant forum to be the Tribunal or 
the District Court, in respect of the claims relating to insurance 
policies issued prior to the promulgation of Ordinance was finally 
resolved by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case of Mst. Naseem 
Begum and others supra when the judgment of the learned Full Bench 
of this Court was upheld. Therefore, the circumstances of the present 
case did involve and presented the difficulty in ascertaining correct 
forum having jurisdiction to hear the claim and/or the appeal arising 
therefrom. Moreover, the learned Full Bench of this Court in case of 
Mst. Robina Bibi supra held that the question of limitation fades away 
in the light of the fundamental jurisdictional question that was decided 
in the terms that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to entertain the 
claims. Furthermore, in the said case, it has been also held as under: 
(iv) Claims arising out of insurance policies prior 
to the commencement of the Ordinance may apply 
to the court of competent jurisdiction under the 
repealed Act, subject to the provisions of 
Limitation Act, 1908, which will be considered 
by the respective court on its merits in 
accordance with law.   
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
Additionally, principle of equitable estoppel enunciated and applied 
by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in insurance matter also 
comes in aid of the respondent in relation to the condonation of delay 
at the appellate stage keeping in view the object and nature of the 
contract of insurance. Therefore, for the purpose of the present case, 
even if the application of the respondent under Section 14 read with 
Section 19 of the Limitation Act was not decided at the time of 
conclusion of the trial, for the foregoing reasons, the time spent by the 
respondent in the wrong forums is hereby condoned. Similarly, 
argument of learned counsel for the appellant that instead of filing the 

R.F.A No.16370/2019 
16
plaint returned by the learned Tribunal, fresh suit was filed and hence, 
the same was fatal is also misconceived inasmuch as once a plaint is 
returned under Order VII, Rule 10, CPC, a litigant has option to either 
file the same before the proper forum or institute new suit. Cases 
reported as “Abdul Shakoor and others v. Mst. Hawabai and others” 
(1982 SCMR 867) and “Messrs Pakistan Agro Forestry Corporation 
Ltd. v. T.C. PAF Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd. and others” (PLD 2003 Karachi 
284) are referred in this regard. Case law relied upon by learned 
counsel for the appellant has been considered but found not applicable 
on account of distinguishable facts.  
18. 
Having examined the issues pertaining to limitation and before 
addressing the legal question as to whether the Trial Court was 
justified in granting the compound interest, it will be appropriate to 
advert to the merits of the case. In this regard, learned counsel for the 
appellant stressed that the respondent failed to substantiate as to 
whether her deceased husband fulfilled the threshold criteria entitling 
him for the group insurance. The argument is misconceived inasmuch 
as, admittedly, the scheme under the MOU was a voluntary self-
subscribed additional group insurance scheme introduced for the 
benefit of the Sales Managers, the Sales Officers and the Sales 
Representatives and as per terms of the MOU, the Sales Manager and 
the Sales Officers were to be automatically included in the scheme 
whereas only the Sales Representatives were made eligible provided 
they had completed at least Rs.15,000/- (Rs.10,000 after amendment) 
First Year Premium (FYP) during the previous calendar year. It is 
amply clear that this requirement to complete FYP was not applicable 
to the Sales Manager (like the husband of the respondent) or the Sales 
Officers, hence, rejection of the claim on this ground by the appellant 
is totally misconceived and flawed. For facility of reference, MOU 
dated 01.10.1995 is reproduced hereunder:

R.F.A No.16370/2019

In view of the above, on merits of the case, this Court is of the opinion 
that case of the respondent was based on service record of her 
deceased husband and the appellant was its custodian. Once the 
reemployment of the deceased husband of the respondent on 
04.05.1997 is admitted, and he continued to work till his death on 
24.02.2002, his case was fully covered under the MOU and it was for 
the appellant to prove as to whether any notice was given to the 
deceased husband of the respondent stating that the deceased did not 
qualify for his coverage in terms of the MOU. Admittedly, no such 
notice has been brought on the record before the Trial Court or even 
before this Court in the appellate proceedings. Therefore, this Court is 
of the opinion that the claim of the respondent was wrongly 
rejected/repudiated.     
19. 
This brings me to the final point of determination as to whether 
the Trial Court was justified in awarding compound interest in terms 
of Section 47-B of the Insurance Act. There is no cavil to the 
preposition that the compound interest cannot be awarded under 
Section 47-B of the Insurance Act as the same is no more on the 
statute books after decision in case reported as “Dr. Mahmood-ur-
Rahman Faisal and others v. Secretary, Ministry of Law, Justice and 
Parliamentary Affairs, Government of Pakistan, Islamabad and 
others” (PLD 1992 FSC 1) that has been upheld by the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in case reported as “Dr. M. Aslam Khaki v. Syed 
Muhammad Hashim and 2 others” (PLD 2000 SC 225) which aspect 
has escaped notice of the Trial Court and hence, merits interference.     
20. 
At this juncture, it is imperative to observe that justice must be 
done to both the parties equally, only then the ends of justice can be 
achieved, therefore, this Court is of the opinion that wrongful 
repudiation of the claim of the respondent by the appellant, after 
considerable and unexplained delay cannot be countenanced. In this 
regard, suffice to mention that an insurance contract aims to help the 

R.F.A No.16370/2019 
19
insured or his legal heirs to bounce back from certain unforeseen 
disasters such as death and when an insurance company attempts to 
renege on its obligations, it acts in bad faith that, inter alia, includes 
unreasonable delay in processing a claim and more importantly, the 
delay in intimating the rejection/repudiation that results into limitation 
issue for the insured (including his heirs). The legal as well as the 
equitable obligations to act in good faith towards each other is 
squarely applicable to the insurer who is required to act in an honest 
and upright manner to fulfil its promise. Rejection/repudiation of 
insurance claims on flimsy and baseless grounds offends the 
principles of equity and justice, hence, the insurer must be estopped 
from taking undue advantage by retaining the sums that are due and 
payable to the claimant like the respondent. On merits, the claim of 
the respondent was genuine and should have been allowed well in 
time. Denying and repudiating the claim with an inordinate delay in 
itself exhibits lack of bona fide on part of the appellant. Conversely, 
the respondent is striving hard, in good faith, to recover the same. In 
cases like the one in hand, where the insurer has delayed in paying the 
claim and finally rejected the same without just cause, the insurer 
cannot raise objection as to the limitation as held by the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court and even if such insurer finally pays up the claim, it 
can still be held liable for not doing so “promptly” and “within a 
reasonable time”. Therefore, while the award of compound interest 
@ 5% to the respondent on the claim of Rs. 600,000/- till adjudication 
of the case is not sustainable in the light of dicta laid down in case of 
Dr. Mahmood-ur-Rahman supra, which has been upheld by the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court, this Court is of the opinion that the 
respondent is entitled to the compensatory costs in addition to her 
original insurance coverage/claim, to avoid injustice and balance the 
equities while keeping in view all the relevant circumstances that, 
inter alia, includes factors like the rate of inflation, rate of return on 
investment with passage of time, and the totality of circumstances.

21. 
In view of the above discussion, the impugned judgment and 
decree to the extent of claim of the respondent amounting to 
Rs.600,000/- is upheld along with compensatory costs of 
Rs.1,000,000/. Findings to the extent of award of the compound 
interest on the claim are set aside. Decree sheet be accordingly 
modified.  
22. 
Disposed of in above terms.

rendered by Mr. Hussain Tahir Zaidi, Advocate/learned Amicus 
Curiae is acknowledged, with thanks.
