Writ Petition No.6927 of 2021/BWP 
 
Mst. Samina Zia 
Versus 
Federation of Pakistan & others 
J U D G M E N T 
 
Date of hearing:    05.12.2023. 
Petitioner by: 
Mr. Amir Ajam Malik, Advocate.  
Respondents by: 
Ms. Riffat Yasmeen, Assistant Attorney General 
along with Ulfat Ali, Town Inspector.   
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.: Through 
instant petition, petitioner has sought direction for respondents to 
pay her the amounts present in the joint saving account No.SSA-
1811 (opened on 20.04.2000), maintained by her along with her 
deceased husband namely Syed Mahmood Hussain with Pakistan 
Postal Services, General Post Office, Bahawalpur / respondent 
No.7, by calculating settled profit till to date.  
 
2. 
Learned counsel for petitioner submits that petitioner’s 
husband died on 16.01.2008 and she being a Parda Nashin lady did 
not visit the office of respondent No.7 to inquire about the situation 
of the joint account, however in order to cope up the expenses of 
her daughter’s marriage, she approached said respondent but her 
request was declined on the ground that she is not entitled to get 
interest on the amounts deposited after the death of her husband. He 
adds that the Post Office Savings Account Rules, 1981 (“the Rules 
of 1981”) do not provide any provision which may stipulate that no 
profit would be allowed on money deposited after death of one of 
the joint account holders, hence impugned inaction is unwarranted.

3. 
Contrarily, learned Assistant Attorney General submits that 
Note-2 of Rule 29 of the Post Office Savings Bank Rules provides 
that profit on the account of a deceased depositor ceases to accrue 
from the first day of the month in which notice is issued to the 
person or persons recognized by the Postmaster-General or the 
Head Postmaster (see rule 37) as entitled to receive the balance of 
the account and that no profit will be allowed on money deposited 
after his death in the account of a deceased depositor. 
 
4. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused.  
 
5. 
The admitted facts are that the account No.SSA-1811 was 
jointly opened by petitioner and her husband namely Syed 
Mahmood Hussain on 20.04.2000; that petitioner’s husband died on 
16.01.2008; that amounts were being deposited by petitioner in 
aforesaid joint account after the death of her husband; and that the 
amounts are lying with the Post Office. The point of controversy 
between the parties is whether mere death of one of the joint 
account holders (maintaining joint saving account with Pakistan 
Postal Services) can deprive the survivor from profits accrued on 
the amounts deposited in the joint account after his death especially 
when the amount in the joint account continues to lie and is being 
utilized by the Post Office. 
 
6. 
After amendments brought in the Rules of 1981 by way of 
the Post Office Savings Account (Amendment) Rules, 2014, types 
of Savings Accounts have been provided in Rule 4 according to 
which types of Individual Accounts are: Single Account, Joint 
Account and Pension Account. Joint Account has further two types: 
A-Type, payable to the depositors jointly or to two survivors jointly 
or to the sole survivor. It is provided that such account may be 
operated by all the depositors or both the survivors or the sole 
survivor as the case may be;  B-Type, payable to any one of the 
depositors or either of two survivors or to the sole survivor and 
such account can be operated by one of the depositors or either of 
the two survivors or the sole survivor as the case may be. In the 

3 
Writ Petition No.6927 of 2021/BWP 
 
instant case, joint account was opened by two individuals and the 
survivor is one person, therefore, irrespective of the types of the 
joint account, sole survivor is entitled to retain and operate the 
account within the contemplation of Rule 4 ibid. Note 4 whereof is 
significantly to be visited which is reproduced hereunder: - 
 
Note 4:- A joint account in the names of two adults may be opened 
in addition to a single account and pension account held by either or 
both of the depositors in the same or another Post Office Savings 
Bank. If one of the depositors dies, the joint account shall, as 
from the date of death of such depositor, be deemed to be a 
single account in the name of the surviving depositor, if he is 
already having a single account in his name in the same Post Office 
Savings Bank, one of the two accounts shall be closed. 
(emphasis added) 
 
 
Similar provision is also available in the Post Office Savings 
Account Scheme, 2019 (“the Scheme of 2019”) and its clause 3(2) 
provides that the share of an individual in the balance in a joint 
account shall be in equal proportion. On the death of one of the 
account holder in a joint account, the surviving account holder 
shall be treated as the sole owner of the account and he may 
continue the account in accordance with the provisions of this 
Scheme provided another single account is not held in his name. In 
case a single account exists in the name of the surviving holder, the 
account shall have to be closed. 
 
 
It is clearly deducible that the joint account, even after death 
of one of the joint account holders, does not cease to exist rather 
remains operative to be maintained by the survivor(s) and no 
damage is caused to the amount available in the joint account or 
deposited in future.  
 
7. 
Regarding interest on deposits in joint account, I am unable 
to see any specific provision in the Rules of 1981 and the Scheme 
of 2019 on the subject. However Rule 6 of the Rules of 1981 deals 
with interest on deposits in an account, Sub-Rule (8) whereof 
provides that in the event of death of a depositor, the interest in his 
account shall be allowed only till the end of the month preceding 

4 
Writ Petition No.6927 of 2021/BWP 
 
the month in which notice is issued to the person or persons 
recognized by the Post Office Savings Bank as entitled to receive 
the balance in the said account. Likewise, Clause 5(5) of the 
Scheme of 2019 provides that in the event of death of an account 
holder, the interest in his account shall be paid only in the end of 
the month preceding month in which the account is closed. 
 
 
It seems that these provisions are concerning the single 
account and do not say anything regarding joint account. It is not 
understandable that when amounts are with the Post Office how the 
interest on the same can be denied especially when the survivor is 
still alive, depositing the amount and operating the account.  
 
8. 
 So far as reference to Note 2 of Rule 29 of the Post Office 
Savings Bank Rules is concerned, the said provision says that profit 
on the account of a deceased depositor comes to an end with his 
death inasmuch as profit is not given on money deposited in the 
account of a deceased depositor after his death. Again this provision 
is not dealing with the situation arising in joint accounts and is 
concerning with the death of account holder of single account. Ex 
facie non-mentioning of situation of death of one of the account 
holders of joint accounts in the afore-referred provisions may not 
necessarily be construed a lacuna or gap in the legislation rather it 
is due to the fact that such situation does not affect the joint 
accounts qua its operation / running as well as interest on deposits 
in such accounts.  
 
9. 
In view of the above, instant petition is allowed and 
respondents are directed to make calculation of interest on the 
deposits / amounts in the account in question and disburse the same 
to petitioner by following applicable procedure / policy / rules.
