Advocate. 
Respondent No.1 by:

MIRZA VIQAS RAUF, J. The petitioner was married to 
respondent No.1 (hereinafter referred to as “respondent”) on 19th 
June, 2003 in lieu of dower amounting to Rs.50,000/-. From the 
wedlock four sons namely Abdul Mutlib Kazmi, Abu Talib Kazmi, 
Hassan Raza and Ibn-e-Hussain were born. On account of some 
differences, the respondent instituted a suit for dissolution of 
marriage, recovery of dower, maintenance, gold and dowry articles 
before the Family Court, Attock. Suit was resisted by the petitioner, 
while submitting his written statement, controverting the assertions 
contained in the plaint. On 28th May, 2022 on failure of 
reconciliation proceedings suit for dissolution of marriage was 
decreed in favour of the respondent on the basis of khula in terms of 

Writ Petition No.2521 of 2022 
-2- 
 
Section 10(5) of the Family Courts Act, 1964 (hereinafter referred to 
as “Act, 1964”) subject to relinquishing of dower by the respondent 
as per law and with regard to the remaining controversy issues were 
framed. Feeling dissatisfied the petitioner filed this petition under 
Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973 (hereinafter referred to as “Constitution”) on multiple 
grounds. 
2. 
The petition was admitted for regular hearing by way of order 
dated 21st September, 2022 and in view of the matter in controversy 
involved in this petition, Ch. Imran Hassan Ali, Advocate was 
appointed as amicus curiae to assist the Court. It took numerous 
dates to conclude the hearing and finally hearing is completed on 31st 
October, 2024. 
3. 
Syed Muddasir Abbas Kazmi, Advocate for the petitioner 
submitted that parties to the lis by faith are observing “Fiqah-e-
Jafria” and there are specific bindings in event of dissolution of 
marriage between them on the basis of Talaq or Talaq-e-Khul. He 
added that marriage between the spouses relating to “Fiqah-e-
Jafria” can only be dissolved after recitation of “Seeghas” by the 
husband without any influence or coercion. Learned counsel 
emphasized that in view of amendment in Section 7 of the Muslim 
Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 when the spouses belong to “Fiqah-e-
Jafria”, marriage can only be dissolved in the manner prescribed 
therein. It is also one of the contentions of learned counsel for the 
petitioner that in view of law laid down in the case  عمران انور خان و
 دیگر پنجاب بذریعہ سیکرٹری وزارتِ قانون، الہور و دیگر بنام حکومت (PLD 
2022 Federal Shariat Court 25) the impugned order is not tenable. He 
further contended that according to Para No.310 of Muhammadan 
Law by D.F. Mullah a divorce must be pronounced only in Arabic 
and that too in a specific form. In order to supplement his 
contentions, learned counsel also placed reliance on Syed ALI NAWAZ 
GARDEZI versus LT.-COL. MUHAMMAD YUSUF (PLD 1963 Supreme Court 
51), Mst. MARYAM BANO versus HUSSAIN ALI AND ANOTHER (1984 CLC 
1961), Syed AZHARUL HASSAN NAQVI versus HAMIDA BIBI alias ESHRAT

JAHAN and 3 others (1987 CLC 1041), THE STATE versus SYEDDA SALMA 
BEGUM AND ANOTHER (PLD 1965 (W.P.) Karachi 185) and Syed ASAD 
RAZA NAQVI versus Mst. SAIMA FATIMA and another (2014 MLD 254). 
 4. 
Mr. Khalid Ishaque, learned Advocate General Punjab 
contended that even if parties belong to “Fiqah-e-Jafria” marriage 
can be dissolved on the basis of khula. He added that amendment in 
Section 7 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 is only to the 
extent of Federal Capital Territory and does not apply to marriages 
solemnized 
in Punjab. 
Learned 
Advocate 
General 
Punjab 
emphasized that khula is not against any injunction of Islam and no 
exception can be taken to the decree of dissolution of marriage 
passed in favour of respondent (wife). In the last, learned Advocate 
General Punjab argued that Section 10(4) of the Act, 1964 provides 
summary procedure in case of dissolution of marriage on the basis of 
khula, which has been declared by the Federal Shariat Court as valid 
legislation. Placed reliance on Mst. KHURSHID BIBI versus Baboo 
MUHAMMAD AMIN (PLD 1967 Supreme Court 97), SALEEM AHMAD and 
others versus GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN through Attorney General of 
Pakistan and 2 others (PLD 2014 Federal Shariat Court 43) and Mst. 
BALQIS FATIMA versus NAJM-UL-IKRAM QURESHI (PLD 1959 (W.P.) 
Lahore 566).  
5. 
Ch. Imran Hassan Ali, Advocate/amicus curiae at the very 
outset raised question regarding maintainability of this petition on 
the parameters of writ of certiorari. He submitted that dissolution of 
marriage between the spouses relating to “Fiqah-e-Jafria” is not 
prohibited in Act, 1964, which can be dissolved in a summary 
manner. It is emphatically argued that court can grant decree of 
khula without consent of the husband. It is also one of the arguments 
of learned amicus curiae that in view of doctrine of severability 
when some particular provision of a statute offends or is against a 
constitutional provision that provision is severable from the rest of 
the statute, only that offending provision will be declared void by the 
Court and not the entire statute. Placed reliance on BAZ MUHAMMAD 
KAKAR and others versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through Ministry of 
Law and Justice and others (PLD 2012 Supreme Court 923), Haji SAIF-UR-

RAHMAN SHAHEEN versus ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN through 
Attorney General of Pakistan, Islamabad and 4 others (PLD 2024 Federal 
Shariat Court 9) and KHURRAM SHEHZAD versus FEDERATION OF 
PAKISTAN through Ministry of Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan 
Islamabad and another (PLD 2023 Federal Shariat Court 286).  
6. 
Learned counsel for the respondent, while defending the 
impugned order submitted that self-contradictory stance was taken by the 
petitioner in his application for dismissal of suit as is evident from Para 
Nos.9 & 10 of the said application and the impugned order resulting into 
dissolution of marriage by way of Khula is unexceptionable.  
7. 
Heard. Record perused. 
8. 
The petitioner is aggrieved of order of dissolution of marriage 
on the basis of khula passed by the Family Court, while invoking 
Section 10(5) of the Act, 1964. The petitioner has though initially 
challenged the vires of the order on two-fold grounds; firstly, that the 
Family Court established under the Act, 1964 is not vested with the 
authority to dissolve the marriage by way of khula as spouses are 
observing Shia sect and secondly that the decree of khula cannot be 
awarded to the respondent summarily and without consent of the 
petitioner (husband) and performance of necessary “Seeghas” on his 
part. During the hearing learned counsel, however, opted not to press 
the objection with regard to jurisdiction of Family Court. The moot 
point thus emerges for determination is as under :- 
“Whether a marriage interse spouses observing 
“Shia” sect can be dissolved by the Family 
Court 
through 
khula 
without 
consent 
of 
husband and performance of “Seeghas”?” 
9. 
Before pondering upon the core issue, it would be apposite to 
observe that all Muslims are to be governed by the Quranic 
injunctions. Allah almighty in “Surah-Al-Baqarah” verse 229 
commands in the following words :- 
 ن
َ

Divorce is twice. Then [after that], either keep [her] in an 
acceptable manner or release [her] with good treatment. And it is 
not lawful for you to take anything of what you have given them 
unless both fear that they will not be able to keep [within] the 
limits of Allāh.1 But if you fear that they will not keep [within] the 
limits of Allāh, then there is no blame upon either of them 
concerning that by which she ransoms herself. These are the 
limits of Allāh, so do not transgress them. And whoever 
transgresses the limits of Allāh - it is those who are the 
wrongdoers [i.e., the unjust]. 
To understand the theme and spirit of the above stated verse in better 
terms, we may have a recourse to the “Tafsirs” by some of 
renowned jurists and scholars on the subject. As per Abul Ala 
Maududi, Tafhim-al-Qur’an :- 
“Divorce may be pronounced twice; then either the wife 
be kept honourably or parted with gracefully. And it is not 
lawful for you to take back anything out of what you have 
given them. There is, however, an exception to this; if 
you fear that they might not be able to keep within the 
limits imposed by Allah, there is no harm if both agree 
mutually that the wife should obtain divorce by giving 
something as compensation to the husband. These are 
the bounds set by Allah; therefore do not violate them, for 
those who violate the bounds of Allah are the 
transgressors.” 
Muhammad Asad, The Message of The Qur’an :- 
“A divorce may be revoked twice, whereupon the 
marriage must either be resumed in fairness or dissolved 
in a goodly manner. And it is not lawful for you to take 
back anything of what you have ever given to your wives 
unless both partners have cause to fear that they may 
not be able to keep within the bounds set by God; Hence, 
if you have cause to fear that the two may not be able to 
keep within the bounds set by God, there shall be no sin 
upon either of them for what the wife may given up to her 
husband in order to free herself. These are the bounds 
set by God; do not, then, transgress them: for they who 
transgress the bounds set by God – it is they, they who 
are evildoers!” 
Muhammad Taqi Usmani, The Noble Quran :- 
“Divorce is twice; then either to retain in all fairness, or to 
release nicely. It is not lawful for you to take back 
anything from what you have given them, unless both the 
apprehend that they would not be able to maintain the 
limits set by Allah. Now, if you apprehend that they would

-6- 
 
not maintain the limits set by Allah, then, there is no sin 
on them in what she gives up to secure her release. 
These are the limits set by Allah. Therefore, do not 
exceed them. Whosoever exceeds the limits set by Allah, 
then, those are the transgressors” 
Sayyid Mohammad Hossein Tabataba’i, Tafsir-al-Mizan :- 
“Divorce is twice; then keep (them) in fairness or let 
(them) go with kindness; and it is not lawful for you to 
take any part of what you have given them, unless both 
fear that they cannot keep within the limits of Allah; then 
if you fear that they cannot keep within the limits of Allah, 
there is no blame on them for what she gives up (to 
become free thereby). These are the limits of Allah, so do 
not exceed them, and whoever exceeds the limits of 
Allah then these it is that are the unjust” 
10. 
Islam permits dissolution of marriage between Muslim 
spouses in three ways i.e. Talaq, Mubarat and Khula. As the 
proposition in hand is related to last one, so it would be apt to restrict 
myself to this extent. The literal meaning of term “khula” is to 
extract oneself. According to Ibn Manzur Muhammad bin Mukarram 
(Lisan al-‘Arab), the root of “khul” is “khal” and the verbal noun 
“khal” refers to the act of extraction, removal, detaching or tearing 
out. In its real sense, “khal” is generally associated with things or 
object, such as garments. According to Alauddin Masu’d al-Kasani 
(Badda ‘i’al-sana’i’ fi tarib al-shara ‘i’) the redemption (khul) is 
lexically, “al-naz” which means to pull out/extract something from 
something. Thus, “khala’ha” means that he has removed her from 
his marriage. According to Badruddin Mahmud al-‘Ayni (al-
Binayah), the term “khul” is used technically for marital 
“extraction”, in that it is an act of receiving compensation from the 
wife in exchange of her being relieved from the marital tie. Thus, in 
simple terms, “khul” denotes a woman securing the annulment of her 
marriage in lieu of payment of some compensation to her husband. 
11. 
Above all “Surah Al-Baqarah” verse 229 is complimented by 
ahadith of the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) from the events of 
sunnah one of which recounts (in Sahih al-Bukhari) that when 
Habibah bint Sahl complained to the Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be 
Upon Him) about wanting to separate from her husband purely on 
account of his physical attributes, she was allowed to do so subject to 

Writ Petition No.2521 of 2022 
-7- 
 
return of the garden given to her as dower. The Prophet Muhammad 
(Peace Be Upon Him) then ordered her husband, Thabit bin Qays, to 
accept the garden and separate from her. 
12. 
“Khula” denotes the right of a Muslim woman to seek 
dissolution of her marriage in which she gives or consent to give a 
consideration to the husband for her release from marriage as 
determined by the court. In Subcontinent origin of khula was 
surfaced in the case of Mt. Umar Bibi versus Mohammad Din (A.I.R. (32) 
1945 Lahore 51) and it was pronounced that khula cannot be directed 
by Qazi or court which view was then adopted in Mst. SAYEEDA 
KHANAM versus MUHAMMAD SAMI (PLD 1952 Lahore 113) while 
holding that khula, whilst initiated from the woman’s desire from 
separation, is dissolution of marriage by agreement between the 
parties, against consideration to be paid by the woman to the 
husband. It was thus held that a woman’s hatred for her husband, 
howsoever, intense is not a valid ground for dissolution of marriage 
under Section 2(ix) of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 
1939, unless she can persuade him to release her from the marital 
bond.  
13. 
The above principle of law, however, then went under a 
radical change as in the case of Mst. BALQIS FATIMA versus NAJAM-UL-
IKRAM QURESHI (PLD 1959 (W.P.) Lahore 566) Full Bench of this 
Court carved out “Khula” as a right of wife to seek from the court 
albeit the husband does not agree upon dissolution of marital tie. The 
Full Bench, while heavily relying upon and interpreting verse 2:229 
noted hereinabove coupled with ahadith including Habibah’s case as 
well as practices of the Khulafa-e-Rashideen and opinion of Maulana 
Maududi (in Huqooq-ul-Zaujain) as well as other interpretations by 
renowned Muslim Scholars held that the commandment to refer the 
matter to the Qazi would be pointless, if he could not make a 
determination that the parties cannot live within the bounds set by 
Allah almighty without the husband’s consent to the dissolution of 
marriage. It would not be out of context to mention here that in 
arriving at its conclusion, the court observed that though all schools 

Writ Petition No.2521 of 2022 
-8- 
 
of thought do not accept the jurisdiction of the Qazi to dissolve a 
marriage on basis of khula without the husband’s consent, however, 
in rendering judgment on a question of interpretation of the Quran, 
the High Court is not bound by the opinions of jurists, especially 
where the plain meaning of the verse is clear. Thus, the objection 
that most interpretations by Muslim exegetes of verse 2:229 envisage 
consent of the husband was authoritatively dispelled. This view of 
the court was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in Mst. 
KHURSHID BIBI versus Baboo MUHAMMAD AMIN (PLD 1967 Supreme 
Court 97). The relevant extract from the same is reproduced below :- 
“A few words may now be said about the concept of 
marriage in Islam. As is well-settled, marriage among 
Muslims is not a sacrament, but in the nature of a civil 
contract. Such a contract undoubtedly has spiritual and 
moral overtones and undertones, but legally, in essence, 
it remains a contract between the parties which can be 
the subject of dissolution for good cause. In this respect, 
Islam, the Din-al-Fitrat, conforms to the dictates of human 
nature and does not prescribe the binding together of a 
man and woman to what has been described as "holy 
deadlock." 
The husband is given the right to divorce his wife, 
though, of course, arbitrary divorces are discountenanced. 
There is a saying of the Prophet to the effect that "the 
most detestable of lawful things in Allah's view is divorce” 
)البغض الحال الی ہللا طالق Abou Daood). Similarly, the wife is 
given the right to ask for khula in cases of extreme 
incompatibility though the warning is conveyed by 
ahadith against too free exercise of this privilege, one of 
which says that women asking for khula will be deprived 
of the fragrance of paradise (Trimizi) (باس محرام علیہا رائح
ة 
الجن ة)ایھا المراۃ زوجھا طالقاً من غیر. The warning both to man 
and woman in this regard, is obviously placed on the 
moral rather than the legal plane and is not destructive of 
their legal rights. 
The Qur'an also declares: "Women have rights against 
men, similar to those that, the men have against them, 
according to the well-known rules of equity"  (ولھن مثل الذی
.)علیہن بالمعروف It would, therefore, be surprising if the 
Qur'an did not provide for the separation of the spouses, 
at the instance of the wife, in any circumstances. The 
Qur'an expressly says that the husband should either 
retain the wife, according to well-recognised custom— 
"امساک بالمعروف" (Imsak-un-bil-ma'roof) or release her with 
grace— ""تسریح باحسان (Tasree-hun-bi-ihsan). The word of 
God enjoined the husband not to cling to the woman, in 
order to cause her injury ""وال تمسکوھن ضراراً لتعتدو. Another 

Writ Petition No.2521 of 2022 
-9- 
 
hadith declares— ""ال ضرر وال ضرار فی السالمLazarar-un-wa- 
la-zarar-fil-Islam) "Let no harm be done, nor harm be 
suffered in Islam". In certain circumstances, therefore, if 
the husband proves recalcitrant and does not agree to 
release the woman from the marital bond, the Qazi may 
well intervene to give redress and enforce the Qur'anic 
injunctions. 
As was pointed out by Kaikaus, J. in Mst. Balqis Fatima's 
case the foundation of the law relevant to khula is 
contained in the Qur'anic verses, which may be 
translated as follows: 
"Such divorce may be pronounced twice; then, either 
retain them in a becoming manner or send them away 
with kindness. And it is not lawful for you that you take 
anything of what you have given them, unless both 
fear that they cannot observe the limits prescribed by 
Allah. But, if you fear that they cannot observe the 
limits prescribed by Allah, then it shall be no sin for 
either of them in what she gives to get her freedom. 
These are the limits prescribed by Allah, so 
transgress them not; and whose transgresses the 
limits prescribed by Allah, it is they that are the 
wrong-doers." 
We may first consider the opinions of the commentators 
of the Qur'an as to the meaning of these verses, bearing 
on khula. The words— ""فان خفتم (if you fear) are 
addressed to the community or 
 ٰ"اولی"ال مرمنکم (those in 
authority from among you), and include the Qazi, who 
represents the community, for adjudication of disputes. 
This is borne out from the commentary of the Qur'an by 
Qurtabi, known as  )(الجامع الحکام القرآن "Al Ja'me-le-Ahkaam 
al-Qur'an". The learned author says that this is the 
opinion of Ibn-e-Abbas and Malik-bin-Anas as well as the 
majority of the legists. Similar opinion is expressed by 
زمخشری Zamakhshri in his well-known commentary الکشاف 
(Alkashshaf), by نسفی (Nasafi) in his Tafseer, called  مدارک
 التاویل
 حقایق
 و
التنزیل 
(Madarak-ul-tanzil-wa-Haqaiq-ul- 
Ta'veel), by Baizavi )(بیضاوی in his Tafsir  (اسرار التاویل انوار
)التنزیل و Anwar-ul-Tanzil-wa Israr-ul-Ta'veel, by القسطالنی 
(Al-Qastallani) in his ارشاد السآزی (Irshad-us-Sazi), by 
جصا
ص Jassas in his احکام القرآن (Ahkamul Qur'an) and by 
the authors of تفسیر ابن کثیر (Tafsir Ibne Kasir) and تفسیر خازن 
(Tafsir Khazin). Baizavi distinctly says that this is so 
because the rulers are in a position to give orders when 
disputes are presented before them. In more recent 
times, Mufti Muhammad Abduh of Egypt, in his Tafsir Al 
Manay تفسیر المنأ has endorsed this view. For analogy, the 
cases of لعان (li'an) and ایال (’Ila) عنین (Inin) and Mafqoodel 
Khabar )(مفقود الخبر may be cited a in which cases the 
Qazi, it is settled, has the authority to separate the 
spouses, even if the husband is refusing to grant a 
divorce or is not available. The Hedaya, the ردالمحتار 

Writ Petition No.2521 of 2022 
-10- 
 
(Radd-ul-Muhtar) and the احکام القران (Ahkam-ul-Qur'an) of 
الجصاص (Aljasas) agree in this respect. 
By the phrase "Limits of Allah", according to the 
above-cited commentators, reference is intended to the 
injunctions regarding the performance of conjugal 
obligations while living together. Ibne-Hammam )(ابن ھمام 
in his )(فتح القدیر (Fateh-ul-Qadir), Vol. III, p. 199 and 
)(جصاص Jassas in his )(احکام القران (Ahkamul Qur'an), Vol. 
1, p. 391 have adopted this view which also finds 
mention in Sahih Bokhari (Arabic Text), published by 
Karkhana Tijarat-i-Kutub, Karachi (Vol. II, p. 794). It is 
explained that incurable aversion to the husband, on the 
part of the wife would be sufficient justification for khula. 
Shah Wali Amin Ullah of Delhi in )(المسویٰ من احادیث المؤطا 
AI-Musawwa-min-Ahadith-al-Muatta Vol. II, p. 160) goes 
to the length of saying that "even if she obtains khul' 
without any reason (apart from personal dislike) it is 
lawful but not approved. The reason is that the Prophet 
and the Companions never inquired from her the reason 
for her (seeking) khul'." 
The question whether khula is to be equated with talaq, 
or it is a form of, dissolution of marriage in a category of 
its own, has been the subject of controversy amongst the 
jurists. Ibn-i-Rushud, in his Badaya-tul-Mujtahid, says 
that most of the ulema and Imam Malik and Imam Abu 
Hanifa are of the opinion that Khula is equivalent to talaq. 
On the other hand, Imam Shafe'i, Imam Ahmad, Imam 
Daood and out of the Companions, Ibn-e-Abbas were of 
the view that khula amounts to fiskh-i-nikah (cancellation 
or dissolution of marriage) and not talaq. Imam Shafe'i 
had also stated on another occasion that if the husband 
intended talaq, even in a contract of khula, it would 
operate as talaq and if he had the intention of 
fiskh-i-nikah, it will have effect as such. lbn-e-Hajar 
Asqlani in his books  )(الدرایه فی تخرجة احادیث الہدایه وفتح الباری
(Alderaya-fi-Takhrija-Ahadith-ul-Hidaya and Fat-hul-Bari) prefers 
the opinion of Ibn-e-Abbas on this point and casts doubt 
on the authenticity of the hadith which equates it with 
)(طالق بائن (irreversible divorce). He relies in this 
connection on a Tradition of the Prophet, which specified 
that Sabet-bin-Qais's wife, after the grant of khula, was 
ordered to pass one period of menstruation as her iddat 
and this would not be so if khula were talaq. He reiterates 
this position in )(تلخیص الھبیر (Talkhisul Habir Vol. III, p. 
205). On the other hand, the authorities quoted, on behalf 
of the respondent, including the Hedaya, take the view 
that there is no difference between khula and talaq. This 
question need not detain us further. There are good 
reasons for the view that khula is separation and not 
talaq, as the right of the husband to take back the wife 
after khula, does not exist, as it does in the case of talaq-
i-raja'i and the period of Iddat is different is the two cases. 
The relevant Ahadith are discussed by Shaukani in  کتاب

Writ Petition No.2521 of 2022 
-11- 
 
الخلع (Kitab-ul-Khul Vol. 111, p. 260) of his celebrated 
work )(نیل االوطار (Nail-al-Autar) and he reaches the 
conclusion that khula is not a type of talaq, but is a 
category apart from it. If this opinion is accepted, then it 
is clear that khula is not dependent on the will of the 
husband alone. But even if khula be regarded as talaq as 
seems to be the view of some of the orthodox Hanafi 
Jurists, the question arises whether the wife is not 
entitled, in appropriate cases, to demand a khula divorce 
from the husband, in the face of the latter's opposition. 
This problem finds no express treatment in the treatises 
of these Hanafi Jurists who content themselves by saying 
that divorce is the right of the husband.” 
14. 
In the case of SALEEM AHMAD and others versus GOVERNMENT 
OF PAKISTAN through Attorney General of Pakistan and 2 others (PLD 2014 
Federal Shariat Court 43) in somewhat similar facts and circumstances 
the Federal Shariat Court held as under :- 
“18. The word "Khula" literally means "to put off". In the 
context of verse which states that "They are garment for 
you and you are garments for them. It denotes laying 
down by the husband of rights and authority over his 
wife, at her instance, on acceptance of consideration by 
means of the word "Khula". It signifies as conditional 
situation on the part of wife, entered into for the purpose 
of dissolving the marital tie at her instance, in lieu of a 
compensation paid or agreed to be paid by her to the 
husband out of her property. In case of mutual 
agreement on such an arrangement, the wife needs not 
go to court and ask for dissolution of her marriage as in 
such a situation the husband would release her from the 
marital bond and the wife would be free to marry any 
other person after the 'iddat' period, as would be 
required in her case, if she is or is not pregnant. The 
relevant verse in this connection is 229 of Sura Al-
Baqara (Reproduced herein above). As is evident, that 
mutual arrangement and agreement for putting an end 
to the marriage tie is not sinful in any way and appear 
commendable in case no reconciliation is possible. But 
a question arises if the husband does not agree to this 
arrangement and refuses to release her from his marital 
tie by not accepting any compensation even and also 
declines to divorce her, what should be the course of 
action for the wife? What would she do if reconciliation 
fails and the husband proves adamant to dissolve the 
marriage? Will it be justified to leave the wife who 
cannot live happily or perform her marital obligations 
grope in the darkness? Should she be pushed back to 
her husband to remain tongue tied, tight lipped, 
depressed, dejected, having a miserable survival 

Writ Petition No.2521 of 2022 
-12- 
 
throughout her whole life? Should she be kept, at the 
mercy of her in laws, vulnerable to indecent immoral 
life? Can anyone call this sort of situation morally 
justified on any standard? Will this position assigned to 
her not defeat the very object of marital peace and 
tranquility? Who will be considered responsible if she 
cannot bear the Mental agony in state of affair and put 
an end to her life by setting herself on fire or adopt any 
other method for committing suicide, which is our normal 
observation off and on, in different parts of the country? 
who will stop or what will prevent her to administer 
poison to her husband if she finds herself entangled in a 
"holy dead lock"? 
We put these questions to almost all the advocates and 
scholars but no satisfactory solution was suggested 
even. As mentioned above "Justice for all" is the 
essence social teachings of Islam. No one is to be 
harmed. 
It has been declared that "Let no harm be inflicted nor 
suffered in Islam". The Holy Qur'an has repeatedly 
stressed the husband's duty to keep the wife with 
kindness. It has been directed to keep them in good 
fellowship or let them go with grace (2:229). At another 
place it has asked the husband to "retain them in 
kindness or set them free with kindness" (2:231). The 
husbands have been ordered not to retain them 
(unjustly) for injury and not to exceed the limits (2.231). 
"Treat them with grace and kindness" (4:19) is a 
command and it has been to be obeyed in letter and 
spirit. These pieces of command are not mere 
instructions or admonitions to be left to the sweet will of 
the husband only. An Islamic State is bound to 
implement them through suitable legislation so that it is 
ensured that none of the spouses is harmed or treated 
unjustly. It is duty-bound to constitute proper judicial 
forums where every one gets justice and where 
grievances are properly redressed. Obviously Islam 
does not intend to force a wife live a miserable life, in a 
hateful unhappy union, for ever. If she is unhappy and 
reconciliation fails, she should be entitled to get relief 
whatsoever. This is what justice demands. This is 
referred to in the Verse: "Women shall have rights 
similar to the right against them, according to what is 
equitable" (2:228). 
19. Here it is pertinent to point out that "Khula" and 
'Mubarat' operate as a single, irrevocable divorce. Even 
thereafter both the spouses can contract fresh marriage 
with mutual consent of course if they want to, without 
any intermediary marriage of the wife with another 
person as is required in the case when a husband 
pronounces divorce for the third time. However, Iddat 
shall be incumbent on the wife if she wants to contract 
marriage with some one else. 

Writ Petition No.2521 of 2022 
-13- 
 
20. Now first of all we refer to the following 
Verses/Ahadith repeatedly quoted in support of the 
petition. 
(a) "And if you divorce them before consummation, 
which you have already fixed for them an amount 
(of dower) then there is one half of what you have 
fixed, unless they (the women) forgive or forgives 
the one in whose hand lies the marriage tie" (2: 
237) 
(b) "Divorced women shall keep themselves waiting 
for three menstrual courses, and it is not 
permissible for them to conceal what Allah has 
created in their if they believe in Allah and in the 
Last Day. Their husbands are best entitled to take 
them back in the meantime, if they really want 
reconciliation; and women have the same rights 
against their men as men have against them 
though for men there is a degree above them. 
Allah is All Powerful, All Wise (2: 228). 
(c) Men are the protectors (i.e. care takers and 
maintainers) of women because Allah has made 
some of them excel the other (in strength), and 
because they spend out of their wealth (to 
support them)......." (4:34) 
Now let us consider the meaning of the verse at 
S.No.(a). As is evident the subject matter herein is the 
payment of dower in case the divorce takes place before 
consummation of marriage when the husband has not 
touched his wife while the amount of dower has already 
been fixed. The verse referring to this says that the wife 
will be entitled to half of the stipulated dower and the 
husband will be required to pay her the same amount 
unless the wife forgoes her claim. If in the second 
alternative, the husband has already paid full dower to 
her, he is entitled to take back half of the same. 
However he may show grace and forgive his claim. This 
is what is referred to in the verse: "or forgives the" one 
in whose hand lies the marriage tie and the remission 
(of the man's half) is closer to Taqwa, and do not forget 
to be graceful to one another. Indeed Allah is Watchful 
of all what you do" 
Obviously this verse is not all related to the issue of 
Khula. Payment of dower is the obligation of husband 
and since he is the one in whose hand lies the marriage 
tie, he alone can forgo his right by not claiming half of 
the amount of dower, if already paid by him to his wife in 
full. Thus the question here pertains only to the payment 
or claiming of dower and not, in any way, to the issue of 
'Khula'. 
The second verse at S.No.(b) is also in the context of 
divorced women who have to wait for three menstrual 
courses before entering into another marital contract, 
provided they have not conceived and are not pregnant. 

Writ Petition No.2521 of 2022 
-14- 
 
Since determination of parentage is highly pertinent, 
they are directed not to conceal what Allah has created 
in their wombs. So in case of divorce they have to 
observe the "Iddat" period which is either three 
menstrual periods, if they are not pregnant, or delivery 
of the child if they are pregnant, and still in another case 
when they are too young or too old and have no 
menstrual course, three months. However, men have an 
edge over them in this respect in the sense that they do 
not have to wait but can marry immediately any time 
without any waiting period. Men have a degree in 
another sense also. They can directly exercise their right 
of divorce without any recourse to a court of law 
whereas in case of 'Khula' the wife has to seek 
indulgence of the court, if her husband does not agree to 
her demand of 'Khula'. The course of judicial process 
provides an opportunity to the wife to thoroughly consider 
pros and cons of her demand for 'Khula". It is similar to 
the period of Iddat in case of revocable divorce given by 
the husband who can, on reconsideration, recall it if 
better sense prevails. Both wife and husband are 
provided opportunity to consider and reconsider their 
course of action and both have to bear financial liability if 
they insist on separation. No one has any superiority over 
the other in respect of their rights and responsibilities. It 
is pertinent to note that this very verse declares 
unequivocally that women have rights similar to what 
they owe to their husbands in graceful manner. Thus 
their rights and responsibilities are similar and there is no 
discrimination whatsoever. Men can arbitrarily divorce to 
dissolve the marital tie and women can ask for her 
release from the same bond through "Khula", if the 
parties feel that they cannot live together within the limits 
prescribed by Allah Almighty. The third Verse at S.No.(c) 
above is self evident and specifies the responsible 
position of the husband being accountable for the 
maintenance of his wife and children. The word used 
here is (
َّ قَوََّامُون) plural of (قَوا م), which means a person 
responsible for administering managing and protecting 
the interests of a person or an organization and looks 
after its affairs. In the context, this verse 'refers to the 
responsibilities of the man who is required to protect, 
safeguard and provide for the needs of those under his 
supervision. Obviously, there are psychological and 
physiological differences between the sexes and they 
have to perform different roles but, admittedly, no one is 
superior to the other except by Taqwa (i.e. faith and good 
deeds). In fact they are complementary to each other. No 
one can ever exist without the other. Both have similar 
rights/ responsibilities with different roles to play in life. 
Nevertheless Islam affirms their equality as human 
beings 
and 
advocates 
and 
duly 
protects 
their 
fundamental rights. All these three verses referred to 

Writ Petition No.2521 of 2022 
-15- 
 
again and again by the petitioner/counsel/Jurist Consult, 
thus do not specifically create a bar for court of 
competent jurisdiction to decree the case of "Khula" 
when reconciliation fails. After all what are the Courts of 
law established for? The courts are there to dissolve the 
disputes that arise between the parties. They can decide 
all type of matters including, admittedly, dissolution of 
marriage on certain grounds. One wonders why they are 
not authorized to decide the case of Khula, if a husband 
does not at all agree to the divorce of his wife and all the 
reconciliatory efforts fail. In this view of the matter we find 
that this verse has nothing to do with the subject of 
"Khula", in the context as has been agitated and argued. 
21. The famous Ahadith pertaining to the incidents of 
'Khula' demanded by Jamila and Habiba, as relied upon 
by the petitioners are also not very explicit in this 
connection. Both the traditions relied upon by the 
petitioners are narrated as follows:-- 
"It is stated that one day Jamila wife of Sabit Ibn Qays 
appeared before the Prophet (      یلص اہلل ہیلع واہل وملس    ) and 
said. "0 Messenger of Allah! I and Sabit can never 
live together. I saw him coming from the other side 
with some men. I found that he had the smallest 
stature, was the blackest and ugliest amongst them: 
I swear by God that I do not dislike him on account of 
religious or moral turpitude, but I dislike him on 
account of his ugliness. I swear by God that if I did 
not fear God I would spit on his face when he comes 
to me (meaning that she hated his very sight). 0 
Messenger of Allah! You can see how beautiful I am 
while Sabit is an ugly person. I do not blame him for 
any depravity in his religious practices or morality, 
but I fear that I may be guilty of transgression of the 
injunctions of Islam." The Prophet (    یلص اہلل ہیلع واہل وملس    ) 
asked he if she would return the orchard given by 
Sabit to her as dower. She replied, "Yes: and if he 
demands more, then I am ready to give him more 
than that". The Messenger of Allah (    یلص اہلل ہیلع واہل وملس    ) 
said, "No: Not more than what he had given to you". 
He then asked Sabit to take back the orchard and to 
release her from the marriage-tie by divorcing her 
which he did. 
The other occurrence is related to another wife of 
Sabit named Habibah, daughter of Suhaye which is 
stated as follows: One day early morning, when the 
Prophet (  یلص اہلل ہیلع وا  ہل وملس    ) came out of his house, he 
saw Habibah waiting outside. He asked her what the 
matter was and why she was standing there. She 
said that she could not pull on with Sabit. When 
Sabit came there, the Prophet (    یلص اہلل ہیلع واہل وملس    ) said 
to him, "Here is Habibah daughter of Suhayl. She 
has complained against you." Habibah said, "0 
Messenger of Allah ! I have still got all that Sabit had 
given me for dower." The Prophet (    یلص اہلل ہیلع واہل وملس    ) 
then ordered Sabit to take it and to release her, that 

Writ Petition No.2521 of 2022 
-16- 
 
is, to divorce her". 
We may mention that in both the cases the words used 
by the Holy Prophet (  یلص اہلل ہیلع واہل وملس    ) are ( 
    
  ط ِ ل  قُھا   ت ِلیقة ط   
)  
(Divorce her) 
   
  ف  ار  قُھا 
(separate here), 
  خ   ل یبس  ل  ھا (leave her), 
    ا  م  ر  الط  الق(he ordered him to divorce her) and ( ف ف ر  ق  بین ھُما) 
(He separate them). (For further detailed discussion see 
Huququz Zawjain by Syed Mawdudi Pages 58-80 and 
Fiqhul Quran by Maulana Umar Ahmad Usmani Vol III, 
Pages 398-417.) 
22. The upshot of the above discussion is that there is 
no specific verse or authentic Ahadith that provides a 
bar to the exercise of jurisdiction by a competent Qazi to 
decree the case of Khula' agitated before him by a wife, 
after reconciliation fails. As discussed above in detail, 
the Ayaat and Ahadith relied upon by the petitioners 
neither specifically relate to the issue of Khula' nor to the 
lack of authority of a Qazi duly authorized by an Islamic 
State to resolve the disputes between husband and 
wife. The interpretation of the said Verses and Ahadith 
is also not unanimous.” 
15. 
So far contention of learned counsel for the petitioner that in 
view of amendment in Section 7 of the Muslim Family Laws 
Ordinance, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as “Ordinance, 1961”) 
when the spouses belong to Fiqah-e-Jafria, marriage can only be 
dissolved in the manner prescribed therein; suffice to observe that 
amendment in Section 7 was introduced through the Muslim Family 
Laws (Second Amendment) Act, 2021, which admittedly is restricted 
to Federally administered areas and it is not extended to the Province 
of Punjab. 
16. 
Adverting to the contention of learned counsel for the 
petitioner that in view of law laid down in  عمران انور خان و دیگر بنام
 پنجاب بذریعہ سیکرٹری وزارتِ قانون، الہور و دیگر حکومت (PLD 2022 
Federal Shariat Court 25) the impugned order is not tenable, it is 
noticed that the said judgment was rendered by the Federal Shariat 
Court on 17th February, 2022 and it was held that in terms thereof 
subsections (5) and (6) of section 10 of the Act, 1964 shall be 
deemed to be annulled and ineffective with effect from 1st May, 
2022. Article 203D of the Constitution deals with the powers, 
jurisdiction and functions of the Federal Shariat Court and in terms 
of proviso to sub-article (2) of Article 203D, no decision of the 
Federal Shariat Court shall be deemed to take effect before the 
expiration of the period within which an appeal therefrom may be 

Writ Petition No.2521 of 2022 
-17- 
 
preferred to the Supreme Court or where an appeal has been so 
preferred, before the disposal of such appeal. Article 203F of the 
Constitution provides a time period for filing an appeal against the 
decision of the Federal Shariat Court before the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan. In terms whereof, if the appeal is to be preferred by any 
party to the proceedings such appeal is to be presented within sixty 
days of the decision whereas if the appeal is to be preferred on behalf 
of the Federation or of a Province it prescribes six months time limit 
for such appeal. It is an admitted position on the record that against 
the decision of the Federal Shariat Court in  عمران انور خان supra case 
an appeal in terms of Article 203F of the Constitution has been 
preferred by the Province of Punjab. From the joint reading of both 
the provisions i.e. Articles 203D and 203F of the Constitution an 
inference can safely be drawn that at the time of passing of 
impugned order, Section 10(5) of the Act, 1964 was intact and as 
such it cannot be said that the impugned order suffers with any 
perversity. Even otherwise in the case  عمران انور خان supra, the 
question before the Federal Shariat Court was not related to “Khula” 
as is evident from the bare perusal of the same.  
17. 
So far judgments in the cases of Syed Ali Nawaz Gardezi’s, 
Mst. MARYAM BANO’s, Syed AZHARUL HASSAN NAQVI’s, THE 
STATE’s and Syed Asad Raza Naqvi’s supra heavily relied upon by 
the learned counsel for the petitioner are concerned, those are related 
to issue of Talaq pronounced in terms of Section 7 of the 
Ordinance, 1961 and as such clearly rested on entirely different 
facts are thus not applicable at all to the present case.  
18. 
The nutshell of above noted threadbare discussion is that a 
wife can seek dissolution of marriage by way of khula from the court 
even if his husband does not give consent for the same, nevertheless 
spouses are observing “Shia” sect. 
19. 
Subsection (5) of Section 10 of the Act, 1964 ordains that in a 
suit for dissolution of marriage on failure of reconciliation 
proceedings, the Family Court shall immediately pass a decree for 

Writ Petition No.2521 of 2022 
-18- 
 
dissolution of marriage and in case of dissolution of marriage 
through khula, may direct the wife to surrender upto fifty percent of 
her deferred dower or upto twenty five percent of her admitted 
prompt dower to husband. No shatters thus can be imposed upon the 
power of Family Court to dissolve the marriage on the basis of 
khula, when reconciliation is not possible. Reliance to this effect can 
be placed on KHURRAM SHEHZAD versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN 
through Ministry of Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan, Islamabad and 
another (PLD 2023 FSC 286). 
20. 
Adverting to the contention of learned counsel for the 
petitioner that without pronouncement of “Seegahjaat” no divorce 
interse “Shia” spouses would become effective, it is observed that a 
similar proposition came under consideration in the case of Syed 
SAJID HUSSAIN ABIDI versus IRAM SHEHZADI ABIDI and others (PLD 
2023 Lahore 38) and this Court ruled as under :- 
“6. 
Notably, 
both the parties have 
got 
their 
statements recorded in the presence of the Family 
Judge. The petitioner has not denied the presence of 
respondent No.1 in the court. His only argument is that 
Talaq will become effective only after Seeghajaat read 
by him. In this context, it will be important to mention 
that under the personal law of Fiqa Jafria the divorce 
takes effect when the Arabic sentences (Seeghajaat) 
are read in presence of two witnesses. To trace out the 
relevant judicial precedents, the first famous authority 
is in case titled Syed Ali Nawaz Shah Gardezi v. Lt.-
Col. Muhammad Yusuf Khan, Commissioner, Quetta 
Division reported as (PLD 1962 (W.P.) Lahore 558) in 
which Single Judge of this Court had dealt with the 
proposition in detail and held in para 74 that two 
witnesses are not only required as a proof of divorce 
under Shia law but essential to the very act of divorce 
as it is related to substantive law. Relevant extract at 
page 626 is reproduced as under:- 
"…..It will be noticed that it is not with regard to 
proof of divorce that the Shia law insists on two 
witnesses but to the very act of divorce and it 
cannot, therefore, be held that the matter related to 
proof and not to substantive law….." 
In Syed Ali Nawaz Shah Gardezi 
v. Lt.-CoL. 
Muhammad Yousaf Khan, Commissioner, Quetta 
Division (PLD 1962 (W.P.) Lahore 558), same view 
(supra) was followed with a further reference to Mulla's 
Principles of Mohammadan Law that under Shia law a 
Talaq must be pronounced orally in the presence of 
two competent witnesses and Talaq communicated in 
writing will not be valid unless the husband is physically 

Writ Petition No.2521 of 2022 
-19- 
 
incapable of pronouncing it orally. Extract from para 5 
is reproduced as under:- 
"Mr. S. Anwarali has also invited my attention to 
Mulla's Principles of Mahommedan Law where it is 
again stated that a Talaq under Shia Law must be 
pronounced orally in the presence of two competent 
witnesses, and a talaq communicated in writing, is 
not valid unless the husband is physically incapable 
of pronouncing it orally." 
Likewise, in The State v. Syedda Salma Begum and 
another reported as (PLD 1965 (W.P.) Karachi 185) 
same view was followed with a reliance upon Muslim 
Law as administered in British India by Saksena 
according to which 
 
"Under Shia Law, a Talaq is of no effect unless it is 
pronounced: 
 
(1) Strictly in accordance with Sunna 
 
(2) in Arabic terms. 
 
(3) in the presence of at least two adult male 
witnesses." 
This follows that Talaq pronounced by respondent 
No.1 was not valid as it did not comply with the 
legal requirements prescribed by Sia Law. If a Shia 
is unable to pronounce Talaq in presence of wife in 
the 
prescribed 
manner 
then 
it 
cannot 
be 
pronounced in presence of two male witnesses and 
communicated to her in writing. There is nothing on 
record to show that the respondent No.1 was 
incapable of pronouncement in the prescribed form 
and manner before the witnesses." 
In Syed Azharul Hassan Naqvi v. Hamida Bibi alias 
Eshrat Jahan and 3 others reported as (1987 CLC 
1041) it was held that Talaq pronounced by a Shia 
male had to be heard by two "Adil" males if it has to 
result in breaking of ties. Relevant extract from para 3 
is reproduced as under:- 
"3. The precise question which came up for decision 
before the learned trial and appellate Courts as well 
as before this Court was whether or not the Talaq 
pronounced by the petitioner was valid. Whereas 
the petitioner insisted that Talaq pronounced by him 
was in consonance with the Muslim law as followed 
by Shias yet respondent No.1 asserted that no valid 
Talaq had been given by the petitioner and that the 
marriage continued to subsist. Admittedly, under 
Shia law pronouncement of Talaq by the petitioner 
was required to be heard by two adil males if it were 
to result in the breaking of marriage tie. The learned 
trial court, on the basis of the evidence led by the 
parties, 
reached 
the 
conclusion 
that 
the 
pronouncement of Talaq made by the petitioner did 
not conform to the requirement of Shia law 
inasmuch as it was not heard by two adil males and, 
therefore, respondent No.1 could not be said to 
have ceased to be his wife. This finding of the 
learned trial Court having been endorsed by the 
learned Additional District Judge the petitioner has 
invoked the extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court." 
In Mst. Asmat Nigar v. Sayed Ibrar Hussain Shah and 2 
others reported as (2004 YLR 111), Division Bench of 
Peshawar High Court has given reference to the 

Writ Petition No.2521 of 2022 
-20- 
 
famous book; Muhammadan Law by Syed Amir Ali the 
Shia doctrine of Talaq was discussed. Relevant extract 
is reproduced as under:- 
"The requirement of valid Talaq under Shia Law is 
that it shall have no effect unless it is pronounced 
strictly in accordance with Shia Law, in Arabic 
words in presence of two adult male witnesses and 
the wife but when the presence/attendance of the 
wife cannot be procured, then the husband can 
pronounce the Talaq in specific Arabic words which 
is known as "Khutba Talaq", but in presence of two 
male witnesses and the same can be reduced into 
writing and forwarded to wife or it may be intimated 
to her otherwise. 
3. Amir Ali in his book Muhammadan Law, Vol. II, 
Seventh Edition has stated Shia Doctrine of Talaq 
as follows:- 
"They do not allow a Talaq to be given in writing nor 
in any language other than Arabic when there is 
ability to pronounce the words necessary for a valid 
repudiation….Even an absent husband cannot 
effect a valid Talaq in writing. He must pronounce 
the words in the presence of witnesses, and the fact 
of his doing so may be recording in writing, which 
may be forwarded to the wife or it may be intimated 
to her otherwise." 
In Syed Asad Raza Naqvi v. Mst. Saima Fatima and 
another (2014 MLD 254), a reference was given to Mst. 
Kaneez Fatima v. Wali Muhammad and another (PLD 
1993 Supreme Court 901), while holding that Section 7 
of the Ordinance, 1961 is to be applied and interpreted 
to the facts of the case. However, it was held that such 
Shia male can pronounce the divorce afresh. Para 14 
is relevant and is reproduced as under:- 
"…..Since, the valid Talaq is a precondition for 
exercise of jurisdiction under section 7(1) of the 
Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, or initiating 
proceedings under it and since the Talaq in 
question is invalid from the very face of it, therefore, 
the respondent No.2 was not liable to act upon such 
invalid Talaq and as such any proceedings, it 
initiated, on the basis of invalid talaq, would be 
illegal and without lawful authority and of no binding 
effect. So far as the case-law cited by learned 
counsel for petitioner in connection with the 
provisions of section 7 of Muslim Family Laws 
Ordinance, 1961, is concerned, a larger Bench of 
Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, examined such 
question in the case of Mst. Kaneez Fatima v. Wali 
Muhammad (PLD 1993 SC 901) and observed in its 
judgment at page 910 as follows:-- 
"The provisions of section 7 of the Ordinance have 
remained controversial from the very beginning and 
there are conflicting views in general about it. In 
view of the Constitutional restraints the Courts 
cannot give any verdict on the conflicting claims 
challenging or justifying the provisions of section 7 
of the Ordinance. However, keeping in view the 
facts 
of 
each 
case 
the 
applicability 
and 
interpretation of section 7 has to be construed in 
that light." 

Writ Petition No.2521 of 2022 
-21- 
 
15. In view of above, this petition is hereby 
disposed of accordingly. with the observation that 
the petitioner will be at liberty to pronounce fresh 
Talaq to his wife the respondent No.1, keeping in 
view the C requirements prescribed under the Shia 
law and thereafter, respondent No 2 shall act in 
accordance with law without any delay. The 
listed/pending application (C.M.A. No.4609) filed by 
petitioner with a prayer to restrain respondent party 
and police concerned, from causing him any 
harassment etc., and from interfering in the matter 
of his second marriage, is also disposed of with 
direction to the police concerned to ensure that the 
harassment, if any, is not caused to the petitioner in 
violation of law." 
A reference may also be given to Mst. Zeba v. Abdul 
Ali (2002 SCMR 1315) a leave granting order. Paras 
Nos. 3 and 4 are relevant and, therefore, reproduced 
as under for ready reference:- 
"3. Learned counsel appearing for petitioner, inter 
alia, contended that according to Shia School of 
thought, respondent Abdul Ali did not pronounce 
Talaq in Arabic (صیغ
ه)
 in presence of two witnesses. 
To substantiate his contention, he referred to 
para.2517 (page 377) of the book “(توضیح المسائل)”. 
He also relied upon the cases of Syed Ali Nawaz 
Gardezi v. Lt. Col. Muhammad Yousaf (PLD 1963 
SC 51) and Mirza Qamar Raza v. Mst. Tahira 
Begum and 14 others (PLD 1988 Kar. 169). 
4. It was argued by the learned counsel that the 
Family Court decided the issue "whether defendant 
has divorced plaintiff on 26-8-1996?" against the 
respondent, after having appreciated the available 
evidence on record, according to the principle of 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, but learned High 
Court in its Constitutional jurisdiction under Article 
199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan disturbed the findings of the fact contrary 
to the settled law that the findings of facts are 
intervened very rarely unless it is established that 
the trial Court has recorded the perverse findings 
and had drawn conclusion which is contrary to law. 
We have heard the learned counsel appearing for 
petitioner and have also gone through the judgment 
cited by him as well as the book “(توض
یح المسائل)”. In 
our opinion, the contention raised by the learned 
counsel needs examination in depth. As question of 
public importance is involved in instant petition as 
such leave to appeal is granted." 
Notably, the amendment recently introduced is exactly 
in accordance with the precedents of the superior 
Courts of this country and the law discussed 
hereinabove.”

The nutshell of above discussion is that Family Court, while 
dissolving the marriage through khula in exercise of powers 
conferred under Section 10(5) of the Act, 1964 has committed no 

Writ Petition No.2521 of 2022 
-22- 
 
illegality and in view thereof, this petition is devoid of any merits. 
Resultantly it is dismissed with no order as to costs.  
22. 
Before parting, I deem it apposite to appreciate the able 
assistance rendered by learned counsel for the petitioner as well as 
learned amicus curiae and learned Advocate General Punjab which 
enabled me to arrive at the above conclusion. 
23. 
The above are the detailed reasons of my short order dated 31st 
October, 2024, which reads as under :- 
“For the reasons to be recorded later, this petition is 
dismissed with no order as to costs.”
