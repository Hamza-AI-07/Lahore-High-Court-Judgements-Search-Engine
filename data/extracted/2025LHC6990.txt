JUDGMENT 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SYED AHSAN RAZA KAZMI, J. Through this Civil 
Revision, the petitioners have challenged the judgment dated 
03.07.2021 and decree dated 07.09.2021 passed by the learned Addl. 
District Judge, Multan whereby appeal of the respondents was 
accepted by setting aside the judgment and decree dated 04.11.2009 
passed by the learned Civil Judge Ist Class, Multan and the case was 
remanded to the learned trial Court with a direction to implead Mst. 
Sabran Bibi in the suit.  
2. 
Brief facts relevant for the disposal of this civil revision are that 
Allah Ditta, predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners filed suit for 
possession against Jan Masih, respondent No.2 by asserting that he 
and Sharif-u-Hassan are joint owners of land and after partition of the 
suit property, khasra No.2921/1 property measuring one kanal 18 
marlas vide record of rights for the year 1991-92 falls in the share of 
Sharif-ul-Hassan, while other khasra No. 2921/2 property measuring

one kanal 18 marlas falls in the share of Allah Ditta; that the petitioner 
filed an application for demarcation of property of khasra No.2921/2; 
that Revenue Officer alongwith field staff reached at the spot and the 
proceedings of demarcation were conducted on 28.03.1994 and 
Roznamcha No. 1389 of demarcation was entered; that Sharif-ul-
Hassan was found as encroacher over 05 marlas 11 yard and all the 
proceedings were in the knowledge of the Jan Masih respondent; that 
he was asked time and again to vacate the property immediately upon 
which he flately refused to do so. The respondent No.2 resisted the 
suit by filing written statement, and raising certain preliminary as well 
as factual objections. Issues were framed. The petitioners’ side 
produced oral as well as documentary evidence and respondent No.2 
did not produce any evidence, so he was proceeded against ex-parte. 
After appreciating the same, the learned Trial Court decreed the suit 
of the petitioners. Being aggrieved, respondent No.1/wife of 
respondent No.2 filed an appeal before the learned appellate court, 
which was accepted and the matter was remanded to the learned Trial 
Court with direction to implead respondent No.1 as defendant in the 
suit and after inviting written statement from her, proceed with the 
suit as per law and procedure. Hence this civil revision.  
3. 
The learned counsel for the petitioners advanced multiple 
arguments, contending that: the appeal preferred by respondent No.1 
was palpably time-barred being filed eight years after the decree, 
without seeking condonation of delay under Section 5 of the 
Limitation Act, 1908; that the appellate court exceeded its jurisdiction 
by reviving a decree that had already attained finality; the sale deed 
related to a distinct Khewat number, rendering it inapplicable to the 
suit property; and that respondent No.1, being the wife of respondent 
No.2, was fully aware of all the proceedings and could not credibly 
claim ignorance of the litigation, thereby rendering her plea 
suspicious. The counsel urged the Court to set aside the appellate 
court's judgment and restore the trial court's decree.

5. 
The core issue before this Court is whether the learned 
Appellate Court exercised its jurisdiction lawfully in admitting and 
deciding a grossly time-barred appeal and remanding the matter to 
trial court despite the decree having attained finality after due process. 
6. 
This Court shall address the ground of limitation first, as it is an 
undisputed fact that the appeal was filed over eight years after passing 
of the original decree dated 04.11.2009. Article 156 of the First 
Schedule to the Limitation Act, 1908, prescribes a 30-day limitation 
period for filing a civil appeal from the date of the decree. Notably, no 
application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act was filed by 
respondent No. 1, nor was any sufficient cause shown for condoning 
the delay. In the absence of such an application or explanation, the 
appeal was clearly not maintainable. It is a well-settled principle that 
limitation bars the remedy, not the right itself. Given the gross delay 
and lack of diligence, the learned Appellate Court's decision to 
entertain the appeal appears to be jurisdictionally flawed. The 
Appellate Court's jurisdiction and discretion to condone delay is not 
unfettered and requires a strict adherence to the statutory provisions. 
By entertaining the time-barred appeal without a valid application or 
sufficient cause, the Appellate Court acted in excess of its jurisdiction. 
The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Khushi 
Muhammad through L.Rs. and others vs. Mst. Fazal Bibi and others 
(PLD 2016 SC 872) held as under:-  
We find ourselves in complete agreement with such 
statements of law. In the exercise of its discretionary 
power the court is not empowered to act upon whim and 
caprice: 
rather 
the 
discretion 
of the 
court is 
circumscribed by the law, recognized norms of justice, 
fair play, equity, logic, rationality and reasonableness. 
Where the Court has passed an order in exercise of its 
discretion by condoning the delay, on the basis of 
sufficient cause which has been made out, it does not 
behave a superior court to interfere in the matter, 
however the unbridled, arbitrary and perverse exercise 
of discretion does not render it immune to the scrutiny 
and correction by the superior court, thus where no 
sufficient cause on record has been made out yet the 
discretion for the condonation of delay is exercised 

-4- 
                 C.R.No. 1047 of 2021 
 
 
subjectively and whimsically it is the duty of the superior 
court to rectify the defect in the exercise of discretion. 
Such duty is duly mandated by the provisions of Section 3 
of the Act.” 
 
7. 
Under the law, the doctrine of constructive notice operates on 
the presumption that a person is deemed to be aware of a fact when, 
through the exercise of reasonable diligence, he or she ought to have 
known it. This principle is consistently invoked in property and civil 
litigation to prevent parties from evading the legal consequences of 
judicial proceedings or transactions on the pretext of ignorance. 
In the present case, where the husband had actively contested 
the petitioner’s suit and failed, while the wife subsequently instituted 
a grossly time-barred appeal asserting ownership of the disputed 
property, yet claiming no knowledge of the decree passed against her 
husband, the doctrine squarely applies. Since the husband and 
wife/respondents No.2 & 1 respectively, are sharing common 
interests, and the registered sale deed—forming the very basis of the 
wife’s ownership claim—bears the husband’s signature as a marginal 
witness, it is legally presumed that she possessed constructive 
knowledge of both the litigation and the resultant decree. Her plea of 
ignorance is therefore untenable, as the surrounding circumstances 
unmistakably establish a nexus of knowledge and shared participation 
in the underlying transaction and proceedings. Accordingly, her 
appeal would be barred by limitation, for the doctrine imputes 
constructive knowledge through her husband’s direct involvement, 
joint residence, and mutual interest in the disputed property. 
8. 
A litigant who, despite having the opportunity, chooses to 
remain passive during the course of proceedings cannot later be 
permitted to assail their outcome. Unfortunately, this fundamental 
precept appears to have escaped the notice of the learned Appellate 
Court, thereby necessitating a reconsideration of its judgment. The 
protection of law is reserved for those who are vigilant in asserting 
their rights, not for those who sleep upon them.

9. 
A perusal of the record also reveals that the Appellate Court's finding that 
the property described in sale deed No.8955/1 dated 15.10.2002 forms part of the 
suit property is manifestly erroneous. The sale deed pertains to Khewat 
No.714/698, whereas the suit property is located in Khewat No.719/703, which are 
entirely distinct, as corroborated by the Register Haqdaran Zamin for 1999-2000. 
Notably, the Appellate Court itself acknowledged in paragraph 10 of the impugned 
judgment that the description of Respondent No.1's property differs from the suit 
property. This glaring misreading and non-reading of evidence constitutes a 
jurisdictional defect, warranting interference by this Court in revision under 
Section 115 CPC. 
10. 
The finality and sanctity of judgments are fundamental to the rule of law. 
Once a competent court has adjudicated a matter through due process, it attains 
finality and binds the parties. Any attempt to reopen such a matter must adhere to 
lawful remedies within the prescribed limitation. The learned Appellate Court's 
decision to revive a long-concluded matter disregards the principle of judicial 
certainty and undermines the rule of law, warranting judicial intervention. 
11. 
It is by now well-settled that where there exists a conflict between the 
findings of the courts below, the view taken by the appellate court ordinarily 
deserves preference. However, if the circumstances of the case reveal that the 
reasoning and appreciation of evidence by the trial court is more cogent, detailed, 
and in conformity with the settled principles of law, then the findings of the trial 
court may justifiably be accorded precedence over those of the appellate forum. 
12. 
Accordingly, this Civil Revision is allowed, the impugned judgment dated 
03.07.2021 and the decree dated 07.09.2021 passed by the learned lower Appellate 
Court are set aside, and the judgment and decree dated 04.11.2009 passed by the 
learned Civil Judge Ist Class, Multan is hereby restored.
