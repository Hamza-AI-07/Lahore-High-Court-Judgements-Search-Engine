Date of Hearing 
22.02.2024 
Petitioner By: 
Mr. Shakeel Javed Chaudhary, Advocate 
Respondents By: 
Sahibzada Muhammad Saleem, Assistant 
Advocate General along with Abdul Jabbar, 
ALO in the office of respondent No.1. 
 
Anwaar Hussain J. This constitutional petition is directed 
against order dated 06.02.2014, by virtue of which the petitioner, Ex-
Fire Rescuer, Punjab Emergency Service (Rescue 1122), Lahore was 
removed from the service on account of absence from duty as well as 
order dated 01.03.2022 passed by respondent No.1/the appellate 
authority, maintaining the impugned order of removal. Prayer has 
been made that the petitioner be reinstated into service along with all 
back benefits.  
2. 
By way of factual background, it has been noted that the 
petitioner admittedly remained absent from the duty, without getting 
his leave sanctioned, since 09.06.2013, where-after the respondents 
issued explanation letters, statedly sent at the home address of the 
petitioner and, upon non-receipt of the reply, it was inferred that the 
petitioner is guilty of misconduct and after issuing show cause notice, 
he was removed from the service, vide order dated 06.02.2014. It is 
case of the petitioner that absence from duty was not willful inasmuch 
as the petitioner was arrested, by the local Police, on 08.04.2013 in a 
false criminal case bearing F.I.R No.76/2013 dated 10.03.2013, under 
Sections 302/148/149 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 registered at 
Police Station Dhanote, District Lodhran and remained incarcerated 
in jail till 19.04.2019 and upon his release, after acquittal from the 

 
 
 
2 
W.P No.6339/2022 
 
 
said case, he immediately filed an application with the respondents for 
his reinstatement, as absence from duty was without any fault that can 
be attributed to the petitioner. However, the said application was 
rejected vide order 27.11.2020, which constrained the petitioner to file 
constitutional petition bearing W.P No.460/2021 that was allowed 
vide order dated 18.11.2021, with the consent of both parties, and it 
was directed that representation/appeal of the petitioner pending with 
respondent No.1 be decided within a period of two months, through a 
speaking order, in accordance with law, after extending a fair 
opportunity of hearing, whereafter impugned order dated 01.03.2022 
has been passed by respondent No.1.  
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that, on the one 
hand, the petitioner has been non-suited on the ground that 
petitioner’s representation/appeal was time barred by a period of 05 
years and 03 months and on the other hand such punishment for 
absence from duty has been imposed, which is alien to the Punjab 
Emergency Service Leave, Efficiency and Discipline Rules 2007 
(“the Rules”), as the only penalty that can be awarded to an employee 
of M/s Rescue 1122 under Rule 6 thereof is deduction of emergency 
allowance or one fifth of salary. Places reliance on the case reported 
as “Faisal Mehboob Khan v. Chief Secretary and 2 others” (2018 
PLC (CS) 216) in support of his contention. 
4. 
Conversely, learned Assistant Advocate General along with 
ALO of the respondent-department have supported the impugned 
orders with the averments that prolong absence of the petitioner from 
duty was willful and hence, the impugned orders are in accordance 
with law.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
6. 
Interplay of the factual matrix of the case and applicable law 
puts forth following questions that require opinion of this Court: 
 

 
 
 
3 
W.P No.6339/2022 
 
 
i. 
 Whether every unauthorized absence from duty is 
necessarily a willful absence even if the same is caused 
by compelling circumstances beyond the control of an 
employee and the petitioner’s representation/appeal was 
rightly dismissed having been time barred ignoring the 
fact that the petitioner was behind the bar in a criminal 
case in which he was ultimately acquitted by a Court of 
competent jurisdiction? 
ii. 
 Whether the department had the authority to impose 
penalty of removal from service in terms of Rule 6 of the 
Rules?  
    
7. 
At the outset, it is important to observe that in any organization, 
it is expected from an employee to maintain discipline; act with 
responsibility; perform his duty with sincerity; and serve the 
institution with honesty and devotion. Absence from duty exhibits 
lack of devotion on part of an employee towards the duty leading to 
indiscipline in the work culture of an organization and such act cannot 
be countenanced. However, at the same time, this Court cannot lose 
sight of the fact that a reasonable employer is expected to take into 
consideration measure, magnitude and degree of misconduct and all 
other relevant circumstances and exclude irrelevant matters before 
drawing the conclusion that an employee is guilty of misconduct 
(willful absence in the present case) in general and imposing major 
punishment of removal from service in particular. 
8. 
Absence without any application or prior permission may 
amount to unauthorized absence, but it does not always mean that the 
same is willful. If the absence is the result of compelling 
circumstances under which it was not possible for an employee to 
report or perform duty, such absence cannot be held to be willful.  
Such compelling circumstances due to which an employee might have 
absented himself is a matter to be considered on case to case basis. In 
all such cases where absence is not willful, the employee cannot be 
held guilty of failure of devotion to the duty or behaviour unbecoming 
of a government servant. The Supreme Court of Pakistan in case 
reported as “Ijaz Akbar v. The Director General (Ext.)L&DD, Punjab, 

 
 
 
4 
W.P No.6339/2022 
 
 
Lahore and others”(2024 PLC (C.S.) 129), observed that 
unauthorized absence from the duty entails two options before the 
departmental authorities. Firstly,  that unauthorized absence may be 
condoned by treating it as ex-post facto leave if the explanation 
offered by the accused employee is found to be justified; and 
secondly, if the employee does not appear or the explanation offered 
is found not to be satisfactory, the disciplinary proceedings may be 
initiated against such employee that may result in imposition of 
penalty, which may range from a major penalty of dismissal or 
removal from service to a minor penalty of censure or withholding of 
increment for a specific period, mainly depending upon number of 
factors, which inter alia, include the nature of service, the position 
(duty) of the employee in that service, the period of absence and the 
cause for the absence. Thus, it becomes clear that where an absent 
employee comes back and seeks to join his duty, the departmental 
authorities are obligated to determine whether the unauthorized 
absence was willful or was the result of such compelling 
circumstances which were beyond the control of the employee. The 
impugned order(s) reveals that the element of “willfulness” was never 
looked into in the case of the petitioner as there were compelling 
circumstances of registration of the FIR against the petitioner and his 
consequent arrest and incarceration in jail till 19.04.2019 rendered it 
beyond his control to report to the authorities concerned.  
9. 
This Court is fully cognizant of the nature of the service 
rendered by the petitioner, i.e., emergency services, which require 
strict adherence to discipline, however, the nature of services 
performed alone cannot be considered as sole determining factor, 
rather the cause of absence has to be juxtaposed with it, in order to 
determine whether an unauthorized absence is willful or otherwise. 
Only when the determination as to willfulness is reached at, the 
second question as to quantum of penalty/punishment is to be looked 
at whether the penalty imposed is proportionate to the facts of the case 

 
 
 
5 
W.P No.6339/2022 
 
 
as the principle of proportionality has become well embedded in our 
jurisprudence.  
10. 
The extreme punishment of removal from service has been 
awarded without any inquiry or determination by considering the 
cause of absence. This Court is of the opinion that every unauthorized 
absence is not willful absence if the same is caused by compelling 
circumstances beyond the control of an employee. At this juncture, it 
is imperative to observe that the petitioner has been non-suited on the 
ground that the criminal proceedings and departmental proceedings 
can go on side by side and the departmental proceedings are 
independent of the result of criminal proceedings while placing 
reliance on case reported as “Muhammad Sardar Khan v. Senior 
Member (Establishment), Board of Revenue, Punjab, Lahore” (1985 
SCMR 1062). Respondent No.1 has misconceived the dicta laid down 
in case of Muhammad Sardar Khan supra. There is no cavil to the 
proposition of law that the result of criminal proceedings cannot have 
bearing on the departmental proceedings but this proposition of law is 
relevant where departmental proceedings and criminal proceedings 
are based upon same occurrence and mere exoneration in criminal 
proceedings do not absolve the delinquent official from the 
departmental proceedings as both involve different standards of proof. 
However, the said proposition of law is not relevant in the instant case 
because the issue in the instant case is neither exoneration from the 
criminal proceedings and benefit thereof in the departmental 
proceedings nor the underlying occurrence in the criminal as well as 
departmental proceedings is same, rather the issue in the instant case 
is whether the unauthorized absence of the petitioner from duty was 
willful or otherwise, on account of arrest in a criminal case. The 
petitioner’s reference to his arrest in criminal case followed by 
criminal proceedings and his subsequent acquittal were the reasons 
justifying his absence and for not filing the appeal within time. The 
petitioner has not relied upon his acquittal in criminal case as a ground 

 
 
 
6 
W.P No.6339/2022 
 
 
for his reinstatement in service and award of back benefits. The arrest 
of the petitioner and subsequent confinement in jail for more than 05 
years fully justified as to why the appeal was not filed in time. 
Therefore, this Court is of the view that the petitioner’s appeal has 
been erroneously dismissed having been time barred. 
11.  
Before rendering opinion on the second question, it will be 
advantageous to reproduce the contents of impugned removal order 
dated 06.02.2014 which reads as under: 
 
“I, therefore, in exercise of powers conferred upon 
me under the provisions of the Leave Efficiency & 
Discipline Rules of the Service, impose the 
penalty of Removal from Service upon you from 
the date of absence on account of wilful absence 
from duty. Furthermore, you are directed to submit 
your complete uniform and other accessories 
issued to you in the Stores of District Multan and 
then approach the Accounts Office for clearance of 
dues, if any.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    (Emphasis supplied) 
 
Bare reading of Rule 6(m) of the Rules reveals that the same does 
not provide for any penalty of dismissal form service. Rule 6 reads as 
under: 
“6. 
Special offences and penalties (1) If an official: 
(a) 
…….. 
(b) 
…….. 
(c) 
…….. 
(d) 
…….. 
(e) 
……..

(f)

(g)

W.P No.6339/2022 
 
 
(l) 
…….. 
(m) 
is absent from duty without prior permission of 
the reporting officer, he shall be liable to one 
fifth deduction of salary with allowance for 
each day’s absence.” 
 
There is no other punishment except one provided in Rule 6(m) of the 
Rules i.e., deduction of 1/5th salary etc. However, it is Rule 7 of the 
Rules which is applicable in the instant case as was the position in 
case of Faisal Mehboob Khan supra. Rule 7 reads as under: 
7. 
Procedure under the Act XII of 2006…. An 
official shall be liable to be proceeded against under 
the provisions of the Act XII of 2006, if he is: 
 
(a) 
guilty of misconduct or any undesirable act;  
(b) 
guilty 
of 
corruption 
or 
is 
reasonably 
considered to be corrupt; 
(c) 
inefficient; and  
(d) 
engaged or is reasonably believed to be engaged in 
subversive activities, and his retention in service is 
prejudicial to national security, or is guilty of 
disclosure of official secrets to any unauthorized 
person.” 
 
    (Emphasis supplied) 
 
It is well evident from the above quoted Rule 7 of the Rules that the 
disciplinary proceedings can be carried out against a regular employee 
of the department under the Punjab Employees Efficiency and 
Discipline Act, 2006 (“the PEEDA”), which provides for major and 
minor penalties for misconduct. Per Section 2(n)(vii) of the PEEDA, 
absence from duty is form of misconduct. Admittedly, the petitioner is 
a regular employee of the respondent department. In present case, it is 
not in dispute that the petitioner was removed from service on account 
of absence from duty under the Rules and not under PEEDA. This 
Court is of the opinion that the removal of the petitioner who is 
regular employee of the respondent department is not envisaged under 
Rule 6 of the Rules as held in case of Faisal Mehboob Khan supra. In 

 
 
 
8 
W.P No.6339/2022 
 
 
the said case, it has been also held that the department can initiate 
disciplinary proceedings against its regular employee in accordance 
with law i.e, PEEDA and in order to remove the petitioner under the 
PEEDA, it was obligatory upon the respondent-department to prove 
his willful absence from duty and as examined hereinabove, element 
of “willfulness” was never looked into by the competent authority.  
12. 
In view of the above discussion, the present petition has merits 
and hence, accepted. The impugned orders of removal from service 
passed by the respondent department, and affirmed by the respondent 
No.1/Appellate Authority are set aside. The petitioner stands 
reinstated in service. As regards the back benefits, this Court is 
cognizant of the fact that on one end of the spectrum, it is the 
petitioner who has not worked for a long time and, at the other end, he 
has also suffered a lot as the legal and factual position of the case has 
not been appreciated by respondent No.1 while hearing his 
departmental appeal, and hence, the petitioner is entitled to certain 
portion of the back benefits, however, this Court intends to show 
restraint in determining the same and leave it to the discretion and 
wisdom of the department, which shall be decided expeditiously, 
preferably within 03 months, keeping in view the doctrine of 
proportionality.  
13. 
Allowed in the above terms.
