MIRZA VIQAS RAUF, J. The appellant herein was 
appointed as Civil Judge-cum-Judicial Magistrate on 04th July, 2010 
after being successful in the competitive examination. After his 
appointment, the appellant was posted out to Jaranwala District 
Faisalabad whereafter he was transferred to Ferozewala District 
Sheikhupura. On successful completion of period of probation the 
appellant was promoted to BS-18 vide notification No.108/RHC/CJJ 
dated 04th July, 2014. The appellant, however, tendered his 
resignation which was accepted on 01st February, 2016. This 
followed a representation on behalf of the appellant but it was 
rejected on 23rd May, 2018, hence this appeal under Section 5 of the 
Punjab 
Subordinate 
Judiciary 
Service 
Tribunal 
Act, 1991 
(hereinafter referred to as “Act, 1991”).

2. 
This appeal is resisted by the respondents on the ground that it 
is hopelessly barred by time as the appellant filed the representation 
after a considerable delay. Facts asserted in the appeal are also 
seriously controverted in reply submitted by the respondents. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the appellant 
was having a lustrous career but he was having serious threats to his 
life by proscribed organization. It is contended that on apprehending 
threats to his life under compulsion, the appellant tendered his 
resignation which in no way is voluntary. Learned counsel submitted 
that on removal of threats, the appellant moved a representation for 
withdrawal of resignation but it is declined through impugned order. 
Learned counsel vehemently contended that the impugned order is 
not tenable under the law. It is also one of the contentions of learned 
counsel for the appellant that similarly placed employees were 
allowed to withdraw resignation and they were reinstated in the 
service. In order to supplement his contentions, learned counsel has 
placed reliance on MUHAMMAD ZAHOOR versus REGISTRAR LAHORE 
HIGH COURT, LAHORE and another (2005 SCMR 1194), Dr. MUHAMMAD 
MUNIR-UL-HAQ and others versus Dr. MUHAMMAD LATIF CHAUDHRY 
and others (1992 SCMR 2135), NABEELA KIRAN versus GOVERNMENT OF 
PUNJAB and others (2020 PLC (C.S.) 560) and Syed FAISAL RAZA GILLANI 
versus LAHORE HIGH COURT, LAHORE through Registrar and others (2015 
PLC (C.S.) 137). 
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel representing the respondents 
submitted that the appellant submitted his resignation with free will 
and consent and it was accepted on 01st February, 2016. He added 
that till acceptance of his resignation the appellant never made any 
request for its withdrawal. Learned counsel contended that the 
departmental appeal was beyond the prescribed period of limitation 
and as such instant appeal is also barred by time. It is argued with 
vehemence that after acceptance of resignation, the appellant is 
precluded to ask for its withdrawal. Learned counsel submitted that 
the appellant was not treated discriminatory. Placed reliance on

SAJJAD HUSSAIN versus 
SECRETARY, MINISTRY OF RAILWAYS, 
ISLAMABAD and others (2012 SCMR 195).

Heard. Record perused. 
6. 
The appellant was initially appointed as Civil Judge-cum-
Judicial Magistrate on 04th July, 2010 as probationary. On successful 
completion of probation period, he was promoted to BS-18 vide 
notification dated 04th July, 2014. It appears from the record that 
during his service the appellant absented himself from the duty as a 
result of which disciplinary proceedings were started against him 
under the Punjab Civil Servants (Efficiency & Discipline) Rules, 
1999. The inquiry officer after conducting inquiry found the 
appellant guilty of misconduct in terms of Rule 3 of the Rules ibid 
and recommended the imposition of major penalty in the shape of 
dismissal from service against him through his report dated 17th 
August, 2015. The appellant, however, tendered his resignation on 
18th October, 2015 which is reproduced below for ready reference 
and convenience, so as to properly appreciate the contentions of 
learned counsel for the appellant in its true prospective :- 
“The undersigned was appointed as a civil Judge-cum-Judicial 
Magistrate on 4th July, 2010 by the honorable Lahore High 
Court, Lahore. On the successful completion of probation, the 
undersigned was promoted to Civil Judge Class II vide 
Notification 108/RHC/CJJ dated 4th July, 2015 by the 
honorable Lahore, High Court Lahore. 
The undersigned during all his years in service as a civil Judge 
performed his judicial duties with honesty, dedication and hard 
work. There has been no dereliction of duties at all material 
times. The undersigned now in order to further broader his 
judicial horizon wants to continue his legal practice and 
education as a lawyer. Therefore, it is humbly submitted to 
kindly accept the resignation, of the undersigned, from services 
as a Judicial Officer and wish him luck in his future endeavors 
for rule of law and administration of justice.” 
7. 
We have noticed that though learned counsel for the appellant 
while taking us to press briefing and special reports of the police 
vehemently contended that there were serious threats to life of the 
appellant and in the said background he tendered his resignation 
which was not voluntary, rather on account of compelling 
circumstances but we are constrained to observe that no such reason 

Service Appeal No.10 of 2018 
-4- 
 
was mentioned in the resignation itself. It is also evident from the 
notification No.19/RHC/CJJ. dated 01st February, 2016 that the 
resignation of the appellant was accepted on account of droppage of 
disciplinary proceedings initiated against him on the charge of 
misconduct. It is also manifestly clear that despite the fact that matter 
of acceptance of resignation remained under consideration for a 
considerable period but no effort was made by the appellant to move 
for its withdrawal. Even after acceptance of the resignation the 
appellant remained mum for a considerable period and finally he 
moved the representation on 09th October, 2017 which was received 
by the respondents on 21st April, 2018. 
8. 
The term “resignation” is defined in various law dictionaries 
as follows :- 
Black’s Law Dictionary Tenth Edition  
“resignation, 1. The act or an instance of surrendering or 
relinquishing an office, right, or claim. 2. A formal notification 
of relinquishing an office or position; an official announcement 
that one has decided to leave one’s job or organization, often in 
the form of a written statement. 3. Hist. The surrender to the 
lord of the vassal’s interest in land.” 
Merriam-Websters’ Collegiate Dictionary Eleventh Edition  
“resignation 1 a; an act or instance of resigning something : 
SURRENDER b: a formal notification of resigning 2 : the 
quality or state of being resigned : SUBMISSIVENESS”  
Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary New 9th Edition 
“resignation 1 the act of giving up your job or position; the 
occasion when you do this: a letter of resignation º There were 
calls for her resignation from the board of directors. º Further 
resignations are expected. COLLECTIONS AT JOB 2 a 
letter, for example to your employers, to say that you are 
giving up your job or position: to offer/hand in/tender your 
resignation º We haven’t received his resignation yet. 3 patient 
willingness to accept a difficult or unpleasant situation that you 
cannot change: They accepted their defeat with resignation.” 
Joint reading of the above referred definitions of “resignation” leads 
us to an irresistible conclusion that resignation means “formal 
renouncement or relinquishment of an office”. It must be intentional 
and voluntary. It is trite law that for drawing a conclusion as to 

Service Appeal No.10 of 2018 
-5- 
 
whether the resignation was voluntary or otherwise facts and 
circumstances in toto have to be taken into consideration.  
9. 
It is also an oft repeated principle of law that once a 
resignation is accepted by the competent authority, the employee 
tendering the same is precluded to recall it. Reliance in this respect 
can be placed on MUHAMMAD SALIM KHAN versus DIRECTOR-
GENERAL, BUREAU OF EMIGRATION AND OVERSEAS EMLOYMENT and 
another (1991 SCMR 440). 
10. 
In the case of MUHAMMAD ZAHOOR versus REGISTRAR LAHORE 
HIGH COURT, LAHORE and another (2005 SCMR 1194) the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan laid down a litmus test for determining the nature 
of resignation as to whether it is voluntary or otherwise in the 
following words :- 
“10. Taking into consideration the principle laid down in the 
above judgment and in the judgment of Abraham (ibid), 
wherein it has been held that in determining whether a person 
has resigned or has been compelled to resign the correct test is 
to find out whether the acts and conduct of the servant evince 
an intention no longer to be bound by the contract, or whether 
the conduct of the employer amounts to a basicrefusal to 
continue the servant on the agreed terms of employment. In the 
latter case there is a wrongful dismissal and repudiation of the 
contract and the use of polite instead of peremptory language 
would not alter the conclusion. In our considered opinion, in 
the instant case the resignation was not tendered voluntarily, 
therefore, the Tribunal erred in law in not granting the relief to 
the petitioner.”  
11. 
So far case of Syed Faisal Raza Gillani’s supra is concerned, 
it is observed that in the said case the Judicial Officer concerned 
after tendering his resignation immediately submitted an application 
for its withdrawal before its acceptance by the competent authority. 
In the said background it is observed that no explanation was on 
record as to why the application of appellant for withdrawal of 
resignation was withheld and not considered before acceptance of 
resignation, which is not the case here. Next is the case of Nabeela 
Kiran’s supra wherein it was observed that the Judicial Officer 
concerned infact moved a complaint for the redressal of her grouses 
and grievances, which was wrongly treated as her resignation. 

Service Appeal No.10 of 2018

Perusal of the facts clearly reveals that facts in the said case were 
entirely different as compared to the present one. So far judgment in 
the case of Dr. Muhammad Munir-ul-Haq and others is concerned, 
it is observed with all reverence that the principles laid down therein 
with regard to resignation are absolute and unequivocal.  
12. 
After having a detail survey of law on the subject, we are of 
the considered view that the resignation of the appellant was 
voluntary without any hint of doubt and as such he is precluded to 
ask for its withdrawal and reinstatement in service.  
13. 
Adverting to the question of limitation it is noticed that in 
terms of Section 21 of the Punjab Civil Servants Act, 1974 
(hereinafter referred to as “Act, 1974”) right of appeal or 
representation is available to a Judicial Officer in respect of any 
order relating to terms and conditions of service, which is to be 
moved within sixty days of communication of such order to him. 
Resignation of the appellant was accepted on 01st February, 2016 but 
he preferred departmental appeal on 21st April, 2018 which was 
clearly beyond the prescribed period of limitation. Law is well 
settled that when departmental appeal or representation is barred by 
time even if the appeal before the Service Tribunal is filed within 
time it would be hit by limitation. In terms of Section 5(a) of the 
“Act, 1991” where an appeal, review or representation to a 
departmental authority is provided under the “Act, 1974”, or any 
rules against any such orders, no appeal shall lie to the Tribunal 
unless the aggrieved person has preferred an appeal or application 
for review or representation to such departmental authority and a 
period of ninety days has elapsed from the date on which such 
appeal, application, or representation was so preferred. On account 
of time barred representation/departmental appeal, the instant appeal 
against the order dated 23rd May, 2018 though apparently seems to 
be in time but actually it is barred by time. Reliance in this respect 
can be placed on SAJJAD HUSSAIN versus SECRETARY, MINISTRY OF 

Service Appeal No.10 of 2018

RAILWAYS, ISLAMABAD and others (2012 SCMR 195) and MUHAMMAD 
ASLAM versus WAPDA and others (2007 SCMR 513). 
14. 
The nutshell of above discussion is that this appeal is devoid 
of any merits, resultantly it is dismissed with no order as to costs.
