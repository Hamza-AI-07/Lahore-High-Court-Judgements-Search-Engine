Instant Sales Tax Reference Application 
(‘Reference’) raises following legal questions, 
having source in the decision of the Appellate 
Tribunal Inland Revenue, Multan Bench, Multan 
(‘Appellate Tribunal’), dated 26.04.2023, 
(i) 
Whether under the facts and in the 
circumstances of the case, the learned ATIR 
was justified in confirming the levy of 
Further Tax under section 3(1A) of the ST 
Act by passing a non-speaking order? 
  
(ii) 
Whether under the facts and in the 
circumstances of the case, the learned ATIR 
was justified in applying retroactively the 
amendment made in sub-section (1A) of 
section 3 of the ST Act by adding phrase “or 
he is not an active taxpayer” through 
Finance Act, 2022 (XIII of 2002) assented 
on 30.06.2022 on the supplies made during 
the tax periods 2013 to 2014? 
 
(iii) 
Whether under the facts and in the 
circumstances of the case, the learned ATIR 
was justified in confirming the levy of 
further tax under section 3(1A) of the ST Act 
in respect of supplies made to Registered 
Persons during the tax periods 2013 to

2014, without answering to the legal aspect 
that merely a Registered Person with the 
status of non-filer or null-filer or Blacklisted 
or Suspended cannot be treated as the 
person who has not obtained registration 
number?”  
2. 
Fundamentally, controversy boils down to 
interpretation of sub-section (1A) of section 3 
[Section 3(1A)] of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 [Act, 
1990], in the context of levy of further tax. 
Questions proposed relate to tax periods spreading 
over the months of October, November and 
December 2013 and February, May, June, October, 
November and December 2014 – tax period(s) 
involved were covered under Section 3(1A) of the 
Act, 1990, inserted through the Finance Act 2013.  
3. 
Heard. 
4. 
First question is answered in the negative – 
order under reference clearly explains and 
elaborates the reasoning in support of the decision 
– [legality of the reasoning would be examined 
while answering third question].  
5. 
Learned counsel for the applicant fails to 
establish that how second question has arisen out 
of the order of the Appellate Tribunal, wherein 
reference to amendment introduced through 
Finance Act 2022 was conspicuous by its absence. 
Second question need not to be answered.  

STR No.43/2023 
 
-:3:- 
 
 
 
6. 
Third question involves construction of 
Section 3(1A) of the Act, 1990, which reads as - 
[as applicable at the time of relevant tax 
period(s)], 
“[(1A) Subject to the provision of sub section (6) of section 8 
or any notification issued thereunder, where taxable supplies 
are made to a person who has not obtained registration 
number there shall be charged, levied and paid a further tax 
at the rate of [one] percent of the value in addition to the rate 
specified in sub sections (1), (1B), (2), (5) and (6)]: 
Provided that the Federal Government may, by 
notification in the official Gazette, specify the taxable supplies 
in respect of which the further tax shall not be charged, levied 
and paid.” 
7. 
It is evident and conspicuously so, that 
acquisition of registration number by a person, to 
whom taxable supplies are made, is mandatory 
condition before claiming exclusion from further 
tax regime. Appellate Tribunal correctly decided 
the issue that taxable supplies made to the persons, 
whose registration(s) were either suspended or 
consequently 
declared 
blacklisted, 
attracts 
application of further tax regime. Submissions by 
learned counsel of the applicant that once 
registration number has been obtained, then 
irrespective of the suspension or blacklisting of 
recipient’s registration, registered person is not 
obligated to charge, levy or pay further tax, are 
fallacious. The expression ‘……has obtained 
registration number’ does not imply exemption, 
simplicitor, upon seeking registration number but 
it essentially mandates that registration, at relevant 

STR No.43/2023 
 
-:4:- 
 
 
 
time of reckoning of taxable supplies, must be 
effective, operative and must not suffer from any 
legal disability, otherwise. Extending endorsement 
qua submissions by learned counsel for the 
applicant would suggest that notwithstanding an 
ineffective, 
inoperative 
or 
dysfunctional 
registration, be it upon suspension or blacklisting 
of registration, liability to pay further tax could not 
be attributed to the application defeats the very 
objective 
of 
imposition 
of 
further 
tax. 
Hypothetically, 
if 
simplicitor 
procuring 
of 
registration number would presumably provide 
alleged protection from the charge / levy of further 
tax, then how was it justiciable to deny benefit of 
input tax adjustment(s), against taxable supplies 
made to such recipients, whose registration(s) was 
either suspended, declared blacklisted or otherwise 
suffering from any disability, under the Act, 1990. 
Use of expression “registration number” implies a 
valid and enforceable registration, and not 
otherwise. Any construction contrary thereto 
would be illogical and undermines apparent 
legislative intent. Hence, taxable supplies to the 
persons who had not obtained registration number 
and to those, who though had the registration 
number but otherwise registration was suspended 
or blacklisted must be treated alike and need to be 

STR No.43/2023 
 
-:5:- 
 
 
 
painted with the same brush. In view of the above,  
mere acquisition / obtaining of registration number 
is not enough for claiming exemption from further 
tax regime, and benefit could be claimed provided 
registration of the recipient, at the time of 
reckoning of taxable supplies, is effective, 
operative and functional for the purposes of  
Section 3(1A) of the Act, 1990. 
8. 
Now we take up the situation where the 
recipient of supplies had obtained registration 
number but had notably failed to file tax return(s) – 
attracting status of a non-filer. This situation is 
slightly different from the scenario discussed in 
preceding paragraph. There is no cavil that failure 
to submit tax return for relevant tax period would 
not per se attract legal disability qua the 
registration, unless alleged failure matures into an 
event 
of 
statutory 
default, 
default 
being 
determinable in the context of the punitive 
action(s) / consequences provided in the Act, 1990. 
We are unable to identify any such exercise 
undertaken by the Appellate Tribunal, to ascertain 
that whether registration of non-filler(s) recipient 
had matured into statutory default, attracting legal 
disability qua the registration. Hypothetically, if 
recipient of 
taxable 
supplies 
has obtained 

STR No.43/2023 
 
-:6:- 
 
 
 
registration, who, later, had rectified failure before 
the incidence of taxable supplies, such situation 
would not attract further tax, but in a converse 
situation the further tax obligation would trigger, 
definitely. Appellate Tribunal had, simplicitor, 
without ascertaining the effect and consequence of 
non-filing of tax return, enforced further tax 
regime, 
which 
manifestly 
is 
an 
improper 
construction of Section 3(1A) of the Act, 1990, in 
the context of allegation of default in non-filling of 
tax return by the recipient of alleged supplies. It is 
pertinent to mention that non-filing of tax return 
may lead to suspension / blacklisting, as per Rule 
12 of the Sales Tax Rules 2006 subject to the 
requirements prescribed.  
  
Whether registration of non-filer recipients 
was ineffective, inoperative or under any legal 
disability at relevant time; this determination was 
conspicuously missing. And tenable findings were 
not recorded by the Appellate Tribunal, in this 
behalf. 
9. 
In view of the above, third question is 
answered by holding that status of non-filer qua 
applicability of further tax was not determined, 
and for re-determination of liability of further tax, 
with reference to the allegation of non-filing of tax

returns by the recipient of supplies, who had 
otherwise obtained registration number(s), we are 
inclined to remand this matter to Appellate 
Tribunal, where, to this extent only, the appeal of 
the applicant shall be deemed pending.
