5. 
Tehmina 
Bibi 
(deceased/the 
then 
injured) 
died 
on 
28.08.2021 at 12:45 a.m. after two days of the occurrence.  
6. 
Above narrated statement (Exh.PM) of Tehmina Bibi 
(complainant/deceased, the then injured) has been treated by the 
trial Court as her dying declaration. MLR (Exh.PC) of 
Tehmina Bibi (deceased/the then injured) shows that she reached 
hospital on 26.08.2021 at 03:55 p.m. (soon after 1 hour and 25-
minutues of the occurrence) and was conscious, well oriented in 
time, place and person having GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale) 
15/15. Naeem Maqsood  ASIPW-10 after getting the 
information regarding the present occurrence also reached 
T.H.Q. Hospital, Kallar Syedan and moved written 
application (Exh.PE) to obtain permission from Medical 
Officer for recording the statement of Tehmina Bibi 
(deceased/the then injured) present in hospital as to whether she 
was able to make her statement or not whereupon Dr. 

3 
Murder Reference No.30 of 2023 &  
Criminal Appeal No.304 of 2023. 
 
 
 
Humairah KhalidPW-4 (Medical Officer) has specifically stated in 
writing at the bottom of said application (Exh.PE) that she 
(deceased/the then injured) is able to make her statement 
whereafter above narrated statement of the deceased/the 
then injured was recorded by Naeem Maqsood ASIPW-10 
wherein she has fully implicated her brother-in-law “دویر” 
(appellant) with specific role of effective fire shot upon her 
person. 
7. 
Both 
the 
abovementioned 
witnesses 
(Naeem 
Maqsood/ASIPW-10 and Dr. Humairah KhalidPW-4) have absolutely no 
grudge or ill-will to falsely implicate the appellant (accused) 
in the present case, rather they are independent witnesses 
and have nothing to do with any of the parties. They were 
cross-examined at length but their evidence could not be 
shaken during the process of cross-examination. They 
have corroborated each other on all material aspects of the 
case. Their evidence is straightforward, trustworthy, 
confidence inspiring and cannot be discarded mere on 
probabilities.  
8. 
The discrepancies in the statements of the PWs 
pointed out by learned counsel for the appellant, are 
minors and general in nature, occur in every case when 
witnesses (who are human-beings) are cross-examined after a 
long time of the occurrence as in present case and are not 
fatal to the prosecution case. 
9. 
Statement of Tehmina Bibi (deceased, the then injured) 
shows that she has fully implicated the appellant which 
has a great weight and sanctity under the law which was 
made soon after the occurrence excluding the chances of 
consultation and deliberation. Learned counsel for the 
appellant could not single out any illegality or infirmity in 
this respect which has rightly been relied upon by the trial 

4 
Murder Reference No.30 of 2023 &  
Criminal Appeal No.304 of 2023. 
 
 
 
Court as her (deceased, the then injured) dying declaration.  
(2021 SCMR 325) “Abdul Khaliq Vs. The State”, (2019 
SCMR 1308) “Nazeer Khan Vs. The State and another” 
and (2015 SCMR 10) “Sikandar Shah Vs. Raza Shah and 
another”. 
10. It was a day light occurrence. Zeeshan Ali (appellant) is 
brother-in-law “دویر” of complainant/deceased and also 
inmate of the house of occurrence, having this close 
relationship inter-se the parties, there is no question of 
misidentity of the appellant leaving the actual culprit scot 
free. In such like cases, substitution of an accused is a 
rare phenomenon. 
11. Postmortem report shows that Dr. Qamar-ur-Nisa 
during postmortem examination on the dead body of 
Tehmina Bibi (deceased) observed firearm injuries on her 
person attributed to the appellant which were ante-
mortem in nature and were sufficient to cause death in 
ordinary course of nature. Dr. Sidra Shabbir appeared in 
secondary evidence as PW-12, who had worked with Dr. 
Qamar-ur-Nisa at THQ Hospital, Kallar Syedan and 
identified her handwriting and signatures on postmortem 
report, therefore, medical evidence has fully supported the 
ocular account discussed above. 
12. There is no need to discuss the motive separately as 
same is mentioned in the statement of Tehmina Bibi 
(deceased, the then injured) which has been accepted by this 
Court as well as the trial Court as her dying declaration.  
13. Pistol .30-bore recovered on pointing out of the 
appellant has matched with the crime empty collected 
from the place of occurrence (Report of PFSA Exh.PW). 
14. Although in the instant case, deceased herself cited 
Faizan Ali (her brother-in-law “دویر”) as an eyewitness of the 

5 
Murder Reference No.30 of 2023 &  
Criminal Appeal No.304 of 2023. 
 
 
 
occurrence yet he (Faizan Ali) while appearing before the trial 
Court as PW-13 has become hostile under brotherly love 
bonding, he has favoured his brother (appellant), husband  
of Tehmina Bibi (deceased, the then injured), being brother of the 
appellant also remained mum in this respect, which is not 
fatal to the prosecution case. It is settled principle of law 
that each criminal case is to be decided having regard to 
its own peculiar facts and circumstances. A test to be 
essentially applied in one case may absolutely be 
irrelevant in another case as the crimes are seldom 
committed in identical situations.  
15. Appellant has denied his involvement in this case in 
his statement recorded u/s 342 Cr.P.C. and stated that he 
is innocent and has falsely been involved in this case 
merely on suspicion and misunderstanding. He has 
neither opted to appear as witness u/s 340 (2) Cr.P.C. nor 
produced any defence evidence in support of his defence 
plea which has rightly been discarded by the trial Court 
through the impugned judgment with sufficient reasons. 
16. In view of above, prosecution has proved its case 
beyond shadow of doubt against the appellant through 
dying declaration of the deceased/the then injured 
supported by medical evidence and positive report of PFSA 
qua matching of crime empty with the weapon of offence, 
discussed above. 
17. Coming to the quantum of sentence of Zeeshan Ali 
(appellant), considering the peculiar facts and circumstances 
of this case, we are of the view that alternative sentence 
i.e. imprisonment for life would meet the ends of justice 
instead of death sentence. (2014 SCMR 1034) “Ghulam 
Mohy-ud-Din alias Haji Babu and others vs. The State”.

Murder Reference No.30 of 2023 &  
Criminal Appeal No.304 of 2023. 
 
 
 
18. Considering above, while maintaining the conviction 
of the appellant (Zeeshan Ali) in offence under Section 302(b) 
PPC, his sentence is altered from death to imprisonment 
for life. The compensation and sentence in default whereof 
awarded by the trial Court are also maintained. Benefit of 
Section 382-B Cr.P.C. is extended to the appellant.  
19. Consequently, with the above said modification in 
the impugned judgment, instant Criminal Appeal filed by 
the appellant (Zeeshan Ali) is hereby dismissed. Murder 
Reference 
is 
answered 
in 
NEGATIVE 
and 
death 
sentence of Zeeshan Ali (appellant) is NOT CONFIRMED.
