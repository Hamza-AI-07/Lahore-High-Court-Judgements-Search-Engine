Advocate 
for 
respondent No.2.   
 
 
 
 
Raheel Kamran J:- The petitioner has assailed the 
order dated 28.04.2022 passed by the learned Guardian Judge (IV), 
Lahore whereby application of the petitioner under section 12 of the 
Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 (‘Act’) to the extent of her minor 
daughter namely, Wania, suffering from mental disability has been 
returned for being not proceedable in view of the provisions of the 
Mental Health Ordinance, 2001 („MHO 2001‟). Additionally, her 
request for interim custody of minors Hareem Fatima and Meerab, who 
are in the custody of their father-respondent No.2, has been declined 
while allowing her visitation rights to meet the minors in terms of 
meeting schedule specified therein.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that findings of the 
learned Guardian Judge, Lahore are without lawful authority inasmuch 
as he has erroneously declined to exercise jurisdiction on the custody 
of minor Wania on the pretext of her mental disability and that such 
matters fell within the jurisdiction of Court of Protection under the 

2 
W.P. No.41017 of 2022. 
 
 
 
MHO 2001 whereas the Guardian Judge/Judge Family Court was 
clearly possessed of authority to decide all applications under section 
12 and 25 of the Act. She adds that even with regard to other minors 
the impugned order is erroneous insofar as it finds their welfare to live 
with their father primarily on the ground that minors Hareem Fatima 
and Meerab are receiving education under the custody of their father.    
3. 
While elaborating her arguments, learned counsel for the 
petitioner contends that sections 12 and 25 of the Act do not draw any 
distinction for the custody as well as guardianship of the minors 
between those who are hale and healthy as well as those suffering from 
any mental disability, therefore, the impugned order is manifestly 
unsustainable in law; that for the purpose of jurisdiction, the provisions 
of sections 12 and 25 of the Act are to be construed in conjunction with 
those of the Family Courts Act, 1964. She emphasizes that in terms of 
section 5(1) of the Family Courts Act, 1964 („FCA 1964‟), exclusive 
jurisdiction has been conferred upon the Family Court to entertain, 
hear and adjudicate upon the matters specified in Part-1 of the 
Schedule to the Act which include custody of children and visitation 
rights of parents to meet them in entry No.5 and guardianship in entry 
No.6; that the term “minor” has been defined in the Act to mean any 
person who has not attained the age of majority which is 18 years; that 
no exception for mentally, physically or otherwise disabled minors is 
made by the aforementioned sections; that in the case of Muhammad 
Khalid Karim v. Mst. Saadia Yaqoob (PLD 2012 SC 66), the Hon‟ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan held that the jurisdiction conferred upon the 
Family Court to entertain, hear and adjudicate upon the matters 
concerning guardians and wards is exclusive for expeditious disposal 
of the matters, which were previously subject to delay by the civil 
courts; that  the expression “exclusive jurisdiction” in section 5 of the 
FCA 1964 shall be rendered redundant if the matter of custody of 
minors is left to the Court of Protection constituted under the MHO 

3 
W.P. No.41017 of 2022. 
 
 
 
2001 while there is a presumption in law against legislative 
redundancy; that the MHO 2001 contains no specific provision 
conferring exclusive jurisdiction qua guardianship of the persons with 
mental disability; that the construction adopted by the Court below in 
the impugned order leads to an apparent conflict between the statutory 
regimes i.e. the Act read with FCA 1964 and the MHO 2001 and in 
order to avoid the same, provisions of the above statues have to be 
harmoniously construed as far as possible and one such harmonious 
interpretation would be to allow the Court of Protection under the 
MHO 2001 to proceed with all matters contemplated under the said 
Ordinance in relation to citizens except those who fell within the 
exclusive jurisdiction of the Family Court under section 5 of the FCA 
1964; that even otherwise, the object, purpose and policy of the two 
statutes is to be taken in account for the purposes of construction and 
resolving the conflict of jurisdiction.  
4. 
As regards the other two minors, learned counsel for the 
petitioner contends that mere fact that minors Hareem Fatima and 
Meerab were receiving education under the custody of their father was 
not sufficient to decline the petitioner‟s application for interim custody 
of the minors. Even otherwise, she adds, the impugned order fails to 
provide any lawful justification for restricting their interaction with the 
mother (i.e the petitioner). Lastly, she emphasizes that the Family 
Court failed to facilitate a congenial and homely environment with a 
reasonable visitation schedule. She finally prays for the acceptance of 
the instant petition and setting aside of the impugned order.   
5. 
Conversely, learned counsel for respondent No.2 has defended 
the impugned order for the reasons stated therein, which according to 
him are unexceptionable. He has questioned maintainability of the 
titled petition challenging the order qua interim custody. While 
referring to the order dated 31.08.2021 passed by this Court in W.P. 
No.51548 of 2021, he contends that the minors were produced before 

4 
W.P. No.41017 of 2022. 
 
 
 
this Court who stated that they were not in illegal confinement of their 
father (i.e. respondent No.2) as a result whereof the parties were 
directed to approach the Guardian Judge for final determination of 
their custody and visitation. According to him, statements of the 
minors before this Court were sufficient to entrust interim custody of 
the minors to their father i.e. respondent No.2. He has referred to the 
provisions of section 2(o) of the MHO 2001 to contend that “minor” 
has been defined in term identical to the definition of minor in the Act. 
He contends that even prior to promulgation of MHO 2001, the matters 
of custody have been referred to special court under Lunacy Act, 1912 
for the purposes of guardian. Reliance in this regard has been placed 
on Sabar Khan v. Amir Hussain and another (PLD 1995 Peshawar 
14). While referring to the preamble states that Mental Health 
Ordinance, 2001 exhaustively deals with treatment of mentally 
disordered persons and matters to the capacity of the patient to manage 
his properties and affairs etc. leaving no room for the jurisdiction of 
other courts in that regard. According to him, section 7 of the MHO 
2001 visualized community based mental health services set up for the 
care, guidance, education and rehabilitation regarding protection of 
mentally disordered persons, which casts an obligation on the Court of 
Protection to protect the rights of mentally disordered person in 
accordance with law. He adds that elaborate provisions have been 
enacted in sections 7 & 17 of the MHO 2001 for assessment or for 
treatment of the patients with mental disability. He maintains that 
section 32 of the MHO 2001 unambiguously provides that where a 
mentally disordered person is incapable of taking care of himself, the 
Court may appoint any suitable person as guardian or order him to be 
looked after in a psychiatric facility and order for his maintenance. 
Learned counsel relies on judgment of the Peshawar High Court in the 
case of Aurangzeb v. Public at large (PLD 2006 Peshawar 116) to 
contend that such provision could be invoked for decision on the 

5 
W.P. No.41017 of 2022. 
 
 
 
custody of minor who is a mentally disordered person. While referring 
to the provision of section 2(i) of the MHO 2001 he suggests that the 
requirement of “informed consent” of nearest relative or guardian for 
the assessment and treatment of mentally disordered person who is a 
minor, clearly indicate that the Ordinance deals with minors. He finally 
prays for dismissal of the titled writ petition. 
6. 
Inasmuch as office of the Advocate General of the province has 
been assigned certain role and responsibilities in the provisions of the 
MHO 2001 such as the requirement of his consent in writing for the 
purpose of judicial proceedings, therefore, the case was fixed for 
hearing him. On his behalf, learned Law Officer for the province states 
that MHO 2001 has an overriding effect as manifest from the section 
60 thereof. While referring to the preamble of MHO 2001 he adds that 
the said legislation applies to mentally disordered person and 
expression “person” includes minor. While referring to section 29 of 
the MHO 2001, he contends that the application of the said section is 
not confined to an order in relation to property of the mentally 
disordered person but also assessment as to whether such person is 
mentally disordered and is “incapable of managing himself”, his 
property and “his affairs”. While referring to section 32 of the 
Ordinance he maintains that the said provision deals with appointment 
of guardian which applies to any person who is incapable of taking 
care of himself and Court may appoint any suitable person as his 
guardian or order his look after. While referring to subsection (2) of 
section 51 of the MHO 2001, he states that consent of the minor 
through his nearest relative or guardian under the MHO 2001 is 
required for the purpose of investigation or treatment and not for 
appointment of the guardian, therefore, the said section cannot be 
given any restrictive interpretation. While referring to section 2(d) of 
MHO 2001, he adds that the Court of Protection has been defined to 
mean the District Court having jurisdiction under this Ordinance in the 

6 
W.P. No.41017 of 2022. 
 
 
 
matters specified herein and designated as such by the Government. He 
emphasizes that section 2(o) of MHO 2001 defines the “minor” to 
mean a child or adolescent not having attained the age of eighteen 
years whereas in the Act, a “ward” has been defined to mean a person 
having the care of the person of a minor or his property, or of both his 
person and property. He finally contends that being a special 
legislation namely MHO 2001 will apply to the case of guardianship of 
the minor Wania and proceedings before the Family Court under the 
Act have been rightly declined through the impugned order. In support 
of his above contention he placed reliance on the judgment passed by 
the learned Division Bench of this Court reported as Yasmin Jang v. 
Advocate General, Punjab and others (PLD 2022 Lahore 495).  
7.  
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
8. 
The titled writ petition has been preferred against order passed 
on an application of the petitioner for the grant of interim custody of 
minors against which the remedy of appeal is not available in view of 
the provision of section 14(3) of the Family Courts Act, 1964, 
therefore, the same is maintainable.  Reliance in this regard is placed 
on the judgment of this Court in the cases of Zahida Tahir v. Javed 
Iqbal and others (2019 YLR 785) and Sarosh Sikander and others v. 
Guardian Judge, Lahore and others (2021 YLR 1989).  
9. 
Law maintains a distinction between custody and guardianship 
and respective rights and obligations in that regard under the Act. The 
definition of „guardian‟ in section 4(2) seems to include the concept of 
custody, unless the same has been exclusively awarded by the court to 
a party who is not the guardian of a minor. Custody under the Act 
involves a right to upbringing of a minor. On the other hand, 
guardianship entails the concept of taking care of the minor even in 
situations when the guardian does not have domain over the corpus 
of the child. A father is considered to be a natural guardian of a 
minor, since even after separation with the mother, and even when 

7 
W.P. No.41017 of 2022. 
 
 
 
the mother has been granted custody of a minor, he is obligated to 
provide financial assistance to the minor.  The liability to maintain 
the minor is not only religious and moral but also is legal.  The right 
of custody of father is subordinate to the fundamental principle i.e. 
welfare of the minor.  Maintenance of child is the duty of father and 
the mother cannot be deprived of custody due to her inability to 
maintain the child for lack of resources.  Reliance in this regard is 
placed on the cases of Mst. Feroze Begum vs. Lt-Col. Muhammad 
Hussain (1983 SCMR 606), Munawar Bibi vs. Muhammad Amin 
(1995 SCMR 1206), Mst. Razia Bibi vs. Riaz Ahmad and another 
(2004 SCMR 821), Mst. Atia Waris v. Sultan Ahmed Khan [PLD 
1959 Lahore 205], Sultana Begum vs. Mir Afzal and others, (PLD 
1988 Karachi 252), Mst. Kaneez Akhtar vs. Abdul Qadoos and 2 
others (2005 MLD 828), Nazan Bibi vs. Additional District Judge, 
Jhang and others (2009 YLR 991), Habib-ur-Rehman vs. Hina Saeed 
(2010 MLD 544), Masroor Hussain vs. Additional District Judge, 
Islamabad (2011 CLC 851), Bushra Asghar v. Dr. Rehmat Ali and 3 
others (2012 MLD 1755) and Ms. Shazia Akbar Ghalzai and 
another vs. Additional District Judge, Islamabad (East) and 2 others 
(2021 MLD 817).   
 
10. 
As far as the matter of interim custody of minors Hareem Fatima 
and Meerab aged 16 years and 10 years respectively is concerned, in 
the impugned order, the petitioner has been disentitled to the custody 
of her minor daughters merely on the ground that they have been 
residing with respondent No.2 since his broken relationship with the 
petitioner and that Hareem Fatima and Meerab were getting education 
under his custody, therefore, it would not be appropriate for the 
welfare of the minors that their custody be disturbed. It is settled law 
that mother of minor girls is entitled to their custody unless there is 
anything available on record to disentitle her.  Reliance in this regard is 
placed on the judgments of the apex Court in the cases of Mst. Tahira 

8 
W.P. No.41017 of 2022. 
 
 
 
v. Additional District Judge, Rawalpindi and others (1990 SCMR 852) 
and Mir Bat Khan v. Mst. Sherin Bibi and others (2019 SCMR 520). 
The impugned order is sketchy and short of necessary tentative details, 
in addition to failure of the Court below to consider how could father 
of the minor girls (i.e. respondent No.2) adequately provide his 
daughters with the care and attention required of a mother keeping in 
view their ages. The impugned order is, therefore, unsustainable in 
law.  
11. 
The impugned order has been passed on application of the 
petitioner under section 12 of the Act which enacts the power to make 
interlocutory order for production of minor and interim protection of 
person and property. Unless there is something repugnant in the 
subject or context, section 4 of the Act defines the 'Minor' to mean a 
person who, under the provisions of the Majority Act, 1875, is to be 
deemed not to have attained his Majority; the 'Guardian‟ to mean a 
person having the care of the person of a minor or his property, or of 
both his person and property and the „Ward‟ to mean a minor for 
whose person or property or both there is guardian. As evident from its 
preamble, the FCA 1964 has been enacted for the establishment of 
Family Courts for expeditious settlement and disposal of disputes 
relating to marriage and family affairs and for matters connected 
therewith. Subject to the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance and the 
Conciliation Courts Ordinance, 1961, exclusive jurisdiction has been 
conferred upon the Family Courts to entertain, hear and adjudicate 
upon matters specified in Part I of the Schedule to the FCA 1964. 
These subject matters include custody of children and the visitation 
rights of the parents to meet them as specified in Entry No.5 of Part I 
of the said Schedule whereas the matters of Guardianship are also 
stipulated in Entry No.6 thereof.  Section 25 of the FCA 1964 deems 
the Family Court to be a District Court for the purposes of Guardians 
and Wards Act, 1890.  Barring a few exceptions specified in sub-

9 
W.P. No.41017 of 2022. 
 
 
 
sections (4) and (5) of section 1 of the FCA 1964, jurisdiction of the 
Family Court over matters of custody is exclusive and no other Court 
including the Guardian Judge has any jurisdiction to deal with such 
matters. In the case of Anne Zahra v. Tahir Ali Khilji and 2 others 
(2001 SCMR 2000), it was observed by the apex Court: 
 
“ …as has been observed, the West Pakistan Family Courts 
Act, 1964 has overriding effect in so far as the matter 
included in the Schedule, therefore, initially it is the Family 
Court which has to be approached in respect of matters 
relating to custody of minor being one of the listed items in 
the Schedule and in determining as to  which of the Family 
Courts shall have jurisdiction to entertain such a petition 
shall have to be decided under the provisions of the said Act 
and the rules framed thereunder…. By virtue of section 25 of 
the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, every Family Court has 
been designated District Court, therefore, there is no 
Guardian Judge as such under the Guardians and Wards Act 
whereas Family Court under the said Act competently seized 
of the matter relating to matter of minors shall be deemed to 
be a District Court.” 
 
12. 
Likewise, in the case of Muhammad Khalid Karim v. Mst. 
Saadia Yaqoob (PLD 2012 SC 66) it was observed by the apex Court 
in paragraph 8:         
“8.  From the above dictum, the relevant portions whereof, have been 
quoted in extenso, it is abundantly and unequivocally clear, that on 
the enforcement of the Act, 1964, the Family Court was vested with 
the exclusive jurisdiction to entertain, hear and adjudicate the 
matters covered by the Act, 1964 and no other Court.  At this 
juncture, it may be also mentioned that the above view is also 
fortified from the provisions of subsections (4) & (5) of section 1 of 
the Act, 1964, because it only had saved those cases for the 
jurisdiction of the Guardian Court which were pending at the time 
when the Act, 1964 came into force, while all future matters which 
otherwise would have been within the jurisdiction of the Guardian 
and Wards Act were subjected to the jurisdiction of the Family 
Court.”    
 
13. 
Now I take up the matter of custody of minor Wania who, from 
perusal of documents placed on record, is suffering from neurological 
disorder known as cerebral palsy since her birth which undisputedly 

10 
W.P. No.41017 of 2022. 
 
 
 
has adversely affected her physical and mental health such that even at 
the age of 13 years she cannot walk without the support of a walker, 
has to wear pampers at the age of 13 and needs constant care, 
medication and supervision. In order to decline its jurisdiction on 
application for the interim custody of minor Wania, the learned court 
below has made a cursory reference to the MHO 2001. Little assistance 
has been rendered on whether or not Wania‟s neurological condition of 
cerebral palsy falls within the definition of a mental disorder in terms 
of section 2(1)(m) of the MHO 2001. The court below passed the 
impugned order on the assumption that she is suffering from mental 
disorder whereas counsel for respondent No.2 has claimed that the 
condition of mental disability of the minor Wania has been admitted by 
the petitioner in her pleadings and conversely counsel for the petitioner 
has emphasized that Wania‟s even if disability falls within the 
definition of a mental disorder in terms of section 2(1)(m) of the MHO 
2001, that is an irrelevant factor for the exercise of jurisdiction under 
the FCA 1964, which could not be declined on that pretext. Learned 
counsels for the parties have extensively referred to the provisions of 
the MHO 2001 while assailing and defending the impugned order in 
addition to relying on provisions of the FCA 1964. 
14. 
It is noteworthy that the legislature is normally not presumed to 
have intended to keep two contradictory enactments on the statute 
book with the intention of repealing the one with the other, without 
expressing an intention to do so. Such an intention cannot be imputed 
to the legislature without strong reasons and unless that is inevitable. 
Before adopting the last-mentioned course, it is necessary for the 
courts to exhaust all possible and reasonable constructions which offer 
an escape from repeal by implication. Reliance in this regard is placed 
on the judgment of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case 
of Syed Mushahid Shah and others vs. Federal Investment Agency 
and others (2017 SCMR 1218). As noted herein above, on matters 

11 
W.P. No.41017 of 2022. 
 
 
 
relating to custody of minors and their guardianship, jurisdiction of the 
Family Courts under section 5 read with items No. 5 & 6 of the 
Schedule to the FCA 1964 is exclusive. Whether the provisions of 
MHO 2001 contradict and repeal the FCA 1964 to take away 
jurisdiction of the Family Court qua custody of minors who are 
suffering from any mental disability and vest the same in the Court of 
Protection? 
15. 
The preamble of the MHO 2001 reveals that the said Ordinance 
was promulgated to consolidate and amend the law for persons with 
mental disorder with respect to their care, treatment, the management 
of their property and other related matters. Chapter No.3 of the said 
Ordinance relates to assessment and treatment and Chapter No.4 
relates to leave and discharge, both of which relate to psychiatry, 
whereas Chapter No.5 thereof relates to judicial proceedings.  
16. 
In the case of Yasmin Jang v. Advocate General, Punjab (PLD 
2022 Lahore 495) where the matter related to validity of an 
application for the consent of Advocate General, it was observed by 
the learned Division Bench of this Court In paragraph No. 4 of the 
judgement : 
“We are here concerned with Chapter-V of the Ordinance 
which deals with judicial proceedings for appointment of 
guardian of person and manager of the property of the mentally 
disordered... the legislature has prescribed a four-steps 
procedure for appointment of guardian of a person and 
manager of the property of the mentally disordered person. The 
first step is to apply for the consent of the Advocate General, 
Punjab. This may be called Consent Application step. 
According to Section 29 of the Ordinance there are four 
mandatory prerequisites for filing the Consent Application, and 
that is, it must be about a person who (i) possesses property, 
(ii) is alleged to be mentally disordered, (iii) resides within the 
jurisdiction of the Court, and (iv) it must be from any of the 
relatives of such person… The second step is to file a petition 
in the Court. Any relative who has obtained the consent of the 
Advocate General, Punjab may file a petition before the Court, 
on which the Court will, in the first instance, by order direct an 
inquiry, for the purpose of ascertaining whether a person, for 
whom the petition has been filed, is mentally disordered and 

12 
W.P. No.41017 of 2022. 
 
 
 
incapable of managing himself, his property and his affairs. In 
the third step, the Court, after assessing the mental capacity, 
shall proceed to determine the suitability of a person to be 
appointed as guardian/manager, and in this process, the Court 
will observe the principle of welfare of the mentally disordered 
person. And in the fourth and last step, the Court in respect of a 
mentally disordered person may under section 32 of the 
Ordinance appoint suitable person to be his guardian or order 
him to be looked after in a psychiatric facility and order for his 
maintenance, and for management of property of such person 
the Court under section 33 shall appoint manager.…” 
 
17. 
No doubt sections 32 and 33 of the MHO 2001 vest authority in 
the Court of Protection for the appointment of guardian of a mentally 
disordered person who is incapable of taking care of himself or the 
manager of his property when he is incapable of managing his 
property, however, judicial proceedings in that regard are governed by 
the provisions of sections 29 to 31. The requirements of possession of 
property by the person alleged to be mentally disordered and consent 
in writing of the Advocate General Punjab prescribed in section 29 ibid 
are mandatory prerequisites for judicial proceedings qua appointment 
of guardian and/or manager under the MHO 2001 whereas none of that 
is required for the assumption and exercise of jurisdiction by the 
Family Court under the FCA 1964 since no minor can be left without a 
guardian and custodian.  
18. 
The main crux of the MHO 2001 essentially relates to 
psychiatric facility and management of property of the mentally 
disabled persons and appointment of guardian under the MHO 2001 is 
in that context. The dispute inter se parents of a minor for his or her 
custody and/or guardianship is manifestly not a subject matter of the 
MHO 2001, which falls within the exclusive domain of Family Court 
even when the minor suffers from any disability. Therefore, the 
provisions of MHO 2001 do not contradict and repeal the provisions of 
section 5 read with items No. 5 & 6 of the Schedule to the FCA 1964 
to take away jurisdiction of the Family Court in disputes amongst 

13 
W.P. No.41017 of 2022. 
 
 
 
parents regarding guardianship and/or custody of minors who are 
suffering from any mental disability. 
19. 
The overriding effect of the  MHO 2001, as provided in section 
60 thereof, is again limited to cases of conflict, which is not the case 
here since the dispute in the instant case involves custody of the minor  
amongst her parents and Wania is not claimed to be in possession of 
any property.       
20. 
No doubt judgment of the learned Division Bench of this Court 
in the case of Yasmin Jang supra provides valuable guidelines for 
understanding the provisions of sections 29, 32 and 33 of the MHO 
2021, however, it cannot be lost sight of that unlike the instant case 
there was no contest regarding any conflict of jurisdiction between the 
Court of Protection and the Family Court in the context of dispute 
amongst parents regarding custody or guardianship of a minor, 
therefore, the same is distinguishable on facts and reliance of the 
learned Law Officer in that regard is misconceived and not helpful.  
21. 
For the foregoing reasons, this writ petition is allowed, the 
impugned order dated 28.04.2022 is set aside resultantly application of 
the petitioner for interim custody of the minor shall be deemed to be 
pending with the Family Court Lahore seized of the matter for decision 
afresh expeditiously in accordance with law. There shall be no order as 
to costs.
