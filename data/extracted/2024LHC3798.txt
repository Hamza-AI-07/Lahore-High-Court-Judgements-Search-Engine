Muhammad Tariq Nadeem, J.:- Through this criminal 
revision filed under Section 436 read with Section 439 Cr.P.C. the 
petitioner has challenged the order dated 30.11.2023 passed by 
learned Additional Sessions Judge, Shorkot, District Jhang, whereby 
an application filed by Muhammad Hussain (respondent No. 2) for 
declaring him juvenile in case FIR No.189 dated 27.05.2023, for an 
offence under section 363 PPC (later on sections 302, 375-A and 34 
PPC were also added during the course of investigation), registered at 
Police Station Shorkot Cantt. District Jhang, was allowed and he was 
declared a „Juvenile‟ for the purpose of his trial in the above-
mentioned case.  
2. 
The synopsis of the case gleaned out from the crime report are 
that Imran Haider petitioner was resident of Chak No.5 Ghagh, Tehsil 
Shorkot, District Jhang, and shopkeeper by profession. On 26.05.2023 
at about 07.00 p.m. when petitioner‟s son namely Hassan Raza, aged 
about 14 years, went outside the house after changing clothes, 
Muhammad Husnain respondent No. 2 and his co-accused forcibly 

Criminal Revision No. 83203  of 2023

took him on motorcycle and when his son did not come back, he 
became worried. The PWs namely Muhammad Husnain and Abid Ali 
told the complainant that his son was kidnapped by Muhammad 
Hussain respondent No. 2 and his co-accused Asim Ali. The petitioner 
further maintained in crime report that his son be recovered after 
arresting the accused.  
 
Initially the crime report was lodged against respondent No.2 
and his co-accused namely Asim Ali for an offence under section 363 
PPC. After the arrest of accused, they pointed out the place of murder 
of Hassan Raza and subsequently his dead body was also recovered 
by Rescue 1122 Khanewal. During investigation, respondent No.2 and 
his co-accused also disclosed and pointed out the place where they 
committed sodomy with Hassan Raza (deceased). Accordingly, the 
investigating officer added sections 302, 375-A and 34 PPC in this 
case.      
3. 
After submission of report under section 173, Cr.P.C. charge 
was framed by the trial court on 16.10.2023 and thereafter on 
02.11.2023, respondent No.2 filed an application for declaring him 
„Juvenile‟ in the aforementioned case which was allowed by the trial 
court vide impugned order dated 30.11.2023. Hence, this case. 
 
4. 
It is inter alia contended by learned counsel for the petitioner 
that the trial court has aired the impugned order on wrong premises of 
law; that according to School Leaving Certificate issued by the 
Principal, Khurram Memorial Girls High School (registered), 
Azadpur, Tehsil Shorkot, District Jhang, the date of birth of 
respondent No.2 is 01.01.2004, in this way, he was major at the time 
of occurrence; that Form-B issued by NADRA, wherein the date of 
birth of respondent No.2 has been shown as 20.05.2006, is not a valid 
document but the trial court has wrongly relied upon the same; that in 
the presence of conflicting documents qua the age of respondent No.2, 
it was the duty of trial court to issue a direction for his ossification 

Criminal Revision No. 83203  of 2023

test. To embellish his arguments, learned counsel for the petitioner has 
placed reliance upon the case-laws titled as Muhammad Anwar vs. 
Muhammad Sufiyan and another (2009 SCMR 1073), Oam Parkash 
vs. The State of Rajistan and another (2012 SCMR 1400), Sultan 
Ahmad vs. ASJ-I, Mianwali and two others (PLD 2014 Supreme 
Court 758) and Saleem Khan vs. The State and others (PLD 2020 
Supreme Court 356).  
5. 
Contrarily, learned counsel for respondent No.2 emphatically 
argued that Form-B issued by NADRA is a public document, wherein 
the date of birth of respondent No.2 is mentioned as 20.05.2006. 
Further argued that the School Leaving Certificate produced by the 
petitioner before the trial court was issued by a private school, 
therefore, it has no value in the presence of Form-B issued by 
NADRA.  
 
Similarly, learned Deputy Prosecutor General has submitted 
that the trial court has passed a well-reasoned and speaking order after 
applying its sagacious and judicial mind which needs no interference 
by this Court.  
6. 
I have heard the learned counsel for the parties, anxiously 
considered their arguments and perused the record with their able 
assistance.  
7. 
The main thrust of arguments advanced by learned counsel for 
the petitioner is that there are two conflicting documents qua the date 
of birth of Muhammad Hussain (respondent No.2), for the reason, it 
was incumbent upon the trial court to issue a direction for his 
ossification test. However, I am not in agreement with this contention 
because conducting the ossification test of an accused for the purpose 
of determination of his age as a juvenile offender or otherwise was 
necessary under Section 7 of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, 
2000 (now repealed), which is reproduced as infra for the purpose of 
facilitation:- 

Criminal Revision No. 83203  of 2023  
4
Section 7 Determination of age.– If a question arises as to 
whether a person before it is a child for the purposes of this 
Ordinance, the juvenile court shall record a finding after such 
inquiry which shall include a medical report for determination of 
the age of the child.  
 
On 24.05.2018, Juvenile Justice System Act, 2018, was 
promulgated and Section 8 of the Act ibid deals with the procedure for 
declaring any accused as juvenile which reads as under:- 
8. Determination of age. ---(1) Where a person alleged to have 
committed an offence physically appears or claims to be a juvenile 
for the purpose of this Act, the officer-in-charge of the police 
station or the investigation officer shall make an inquiry to 
determine the age of such person on the basis of his birth 
certificate, educational certificates or any other pertinent 
documents. In absence of such documents, age of such accused 
person may be determined on the basis of a medical examination 
report by a medical officer. 
(2) When an accused person who physically appears to be a 
juvenile for the purpose of this Act is brought before a Court under 
section 167 of the Code, the Court before granting further 
detention shall record its findings regarding age on the basis of 
available record including the report submitted by the police or 
medical examination report by a medical officer. 
 
Besides, Sections 2(b), 2(h), 4(7) and 16 of the Act ibid are also 
relevant to the facts and circumstances of this case, which are 
reproduced hereunder:- 
2. Definitions. ---In this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in 
the subject or context: - 
(a) ………………………………………………………………….. 
(b) "child" means for the purposes of this Act a person who has not 
attained the age of eighteen years; 
(c) ………………………………………………………………….. 
(d) ………………………………………………………………….. 
(e) ………………………………………………………………….. 
(f) ………………………………………………………………….. 
(g) ………………………………………………………………….. 
(h) "juvenile' means, a child who may be dealt with for an offence 
in a manner which is different from an adult; 
4. Juvenile Court. --- 
(1) ………………………………………………………………….. 
(2) ………………………………………………………………….. 
(3) ………………………………………………………………….. 
(4) ………………………………………………………………….. 
(5) ………………………………………………………………….. 
(6) ………………………………………………………………….. 
(7) If any court taking cognizance of an offence finds that an 
accused brought before it is a juvenile, it shall transfer his case to 
the Juvenile Court for further proceedings. 

Criminal Revision No. 83203  of 2023

16. Orders that shall not be passed with respect to a juvenile.--- 
(1) No person who was a juvenile offender at the time of 
commission of an offence shall be awarded punishment of death. 
(2) No juvenile offender shall be committed to prison, ordered to 
labour, put in fetters, handcuffed or given any corporeal 
punishment at any time while in custody: 
Provided that if there is reasonable apprehension of the escape of 
the juvenile offender from custody who is more than sixteen years 
of age and involved in heinous offence or he is previously 
convicted of an offence punishable with imprisonment for life, for 
reasons to be recorded, he may be handcuffed or put into a solitary 
confinement in a Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre or observation 
home for a period not exceeding twenty-four hours. 
 
A comparative study of the above mentioned provisions of law 
has made it abundantly clear that in terms of Section 7 of the repealed 
Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, 2000, medical report qua the 
determination of age was necessary, but Section 8 of the Juvenile 
Justice System Act, 2018, contemplates that where an accused 
physically appears to be a juvenile or he claims himself to be a 
juvenile, the officer in-charge of the police station or the investigating 
officer shall make an inquiry for the determination of his age on the 
basis of birth certificate, educational certificates or any other pertinent 
documents and in the absence of such documents, age of accused 
should be determined on the basis of his medical examination vice 
versa when an accused, who appears to be a juvenile, is brought 
before a court under section 167, Cr.P.C. the court before granting his 
further detention shall record its findings regarding his age on the 
basis of available record submitted by the police or medical 
examination report. It may not be out of place to mention here that 
investigating officer has written the age of respondent No. 2 in the 
certificate of identification annexed with report under section 173, 
Cr.P.C. as 18/19 years but no inquiry was conducted for the 
determination of his age by the officer in-charge of the police station 
or the investigating officer as well as by learned Magistrate. In this 
way, they all have failed to perform their legal obligation in this case. 
It has been well settled by now that if a thing is required to be done in 
a particular manner, then the same should be done in that very manner 

Criminal Revision No. 83203  of 2023

and not otherwise. Wisdom can be derived from the case-laws tilted as 
Manzoor Hussain vs. The State and 8 others (2013 P.Cr.L.J. 18), 
Nasreen Akhtar vs. Mian Abbas, SHO and 7 others (2016 P.Cr.L.J. 
578), Zahida Parveen alias Gooma and another vs. The State and 
others (2019 P.Cr.L.J. 1491) and Adil Khan vs. The State and 
another (2020 P.Cr.L.J. 729). 
8. 
It is worthwhile noticeable here that in the present case, the 
petitioner has entirely relied upon a school leaving certificate for 
determination of age of respondent No.2, but learned counsel for the 
petitioner could not satisfy this Court that how the school leaving 
certificate which was got issued from a private school i.e. Khurram 
Memorial Girls High School Azadpur, Tehsil Shorkot, District Jhang, 
can be given preference over Form-B, which has been issued by 
NADRA in favour of respondent No.2 much prior to the happening of 
incident.  
Another important aspect of this case which cannot be lost sight 
of is that the school leaving certificate produced by learned counsel 
for the petitioner before the trial court is pertaining to one Muhammad 
Husnain son of Muhammad Waheed but in the instant case the name 
of accused is Muhammad Hussain son of Muhammad Waheed. For 
clarity, this Court vide order dated 20.05.2024 called for the judicial 
record of the trial court, which has been produced today and after 
going through the judicial record, it can be easily adjudged that the 
name of student mentioned in the school leaving certificate is 
Muhammad Husnain and not Muhammad Hussain (respondent No.2). 
Another fact which raises a serious question about the authenticity of 
school leaving certificate is that according to this document, 
Muhammad Husnain son of Muhammad Waheed got admission in 
Khurram Memorial Girls High School Azadpur, Tehsil Shorkot, 
District Jhang, on 29.10.2008 as a student of nursery class and he 
remained studying there till 31.03.2013 i.e. for a period of four years 

Criminal Revision No. 83203  of 2023  
7
five months and two days but he could pass only class one during this 
long span of time.  
In the light of above-noted peculiar facts and circumstances of 
this case, school leaving certificate relied upon by the petitioner for 
determination of age of respondent No.2 cannot be said to have 
contradicted Form-B, which is a public document and has been issued 
in latter‟s favour by NADRA. More so, learned counsel for the 
petitioner has relied upon the case-law titled as Saleem Khan vs. The 
State and others (PLD 2020 SC 356) wherein the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan has held that ossification test/medical report should be called 
only in the absence of documentary evidence or contradiction between 
the documents. In this way, wisdom laid down by the Supreme Court 
of Pakistan in the above-referred case also goes against the petitioner. 
9. 
In addition to the above, judicial record of the trial court 
relating to juvenility depicts that respondent No.2 had also produced 
his birth certificate issued by Secretary Union Council Ahmad Pur 
East, District Bahawalpur, along with his Form-B issued by NADRA 
which both are public documents and in these documents, his date of 
birth is mentioned as 20.05.2006. I am of the view that medical report 
was necessary in terms of Section 7 of the repealed Juvenile Justice 
System Ordinance, 2000, but in Section 8 of the Juvenile Justice 
System Act, 2018, it has been mentioned that in absence of 
documentary evidence about the age of accused person, it may be 
determined on the basis of medical examination report by a medical 
officer, but when there is documentary evidence pertaining to the age 
of respondent No.2 then no question arises to send him for ossification 
test, which even otherwise, normally varies one to two years of the 
age of examinee. A reference in this respect may be made to the case 
titled as Intizar Hussain vs. Hamza Ameer, etc.  (2017 SCMR 633) 
wherein the Apex Court of the country has held as under:-

In the light of above mentioned circumstances, I am of the view 
that in the case in hand when respondent No.2 has produced two 
authentic documents i.e. Form-B issued by NADRA and Birth 
Certificate, then these documents should be given preference over the 
school leaving certificate issued by a private school and produced by 
the petitioner. The question of juvenility should be firstly decided in 
the light of documentary evidence and only in the absence of such 
documents, controversy of age can be resolved through ossification 
test. 
10. 
Insofar as the contention of learned counsel for the petitioner 
that respondent No.2 filed application for declaring him a „Juvenile‟ at 
a belated stage and the trial court has ignored this fact is concerned, I 
am of the considered view that this contention has no force because in 
this case, neither the Station House Officer nor the Investigating 
Officer or learned Area Magistrate have acted in accordance with law. 
Mere fact that respondent No.2 did not claim himself to be a juvenile 
during the process of investigation as well as before the Area 
Magistrate, is not a valid ground to oust him from claiming the relief 
before the trial court at the time of his trial. The record evinces that 
after framing of charge on 16.10.2023, respondent No.2 submitted 
application before the trial court on 02.11.2023 for declaring him 

Criminal Revision No. 83203  of 2023  
9
juvenile, therefore, the trial court was quite competent to entertain and 
decide the application of respondent No.2. In the case-law tilted as 
Saleem Khan vs. The State and others (PLD 2020 SC 356), the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan has been pleased to hold as infra:- 
“5. The determination of the age or juvenility of the accused 
under the Juvenile Ordinance was the responsibility of the 
trial court, requiring the trial court to hold an inquiry 
including obtaining a medical report for the determination of 
age. However, this process underwent change under section 8 
of the Juvenile Act, wherein if the accused physically appears 
or claims to be a juvenile, the Police shall make an inquiry to 
determine the age of the accused on the basis of his birth 
certificate, educational certificate or any other pertinent 
document. In the absence of such documents, age of such 
accused person may be determined on the basis of a medical 
examination report by a medical officer. Therefore, the Police 
are to determine the juvenility of the accused and thereafter 
the case is put up before the Juvenile Court for trial. Section 
8(2) provides that if the accused physically appears to be a 
juvenile when brought before a court (of general criminal 
jurisdiction) under section 167 Cr.P.C the court shall before 
granting further detention record its finding regarding age of 
the accused. Section 4(7) of the Juvenile Act provides that a 
criminal court of general jurisdiction can find the accused to 
be a juvenile and thereafter transfer the case to the juvenile 
court for further proceedings. Therefore, in the absence of any 
inquiry by the Police the determination of age and juvenility 
of the accused can be determined by the court having taken 
cognizance of the matter. This is what happened in the instant 
case, when the court declared the petitioner to be a juvenile 
on the application of the petitioner. 
6. Determination of age of an accused who appears or claims 
to be a juvenile is, therefore, initially the statutory 
responsibility of the Police. In the absence of which, the court 
of general jurisdiction enjoys the power to determine the age 
of the accused, and if declared to be a juvenile, transfer the 
case to the concerned Juvenile Court. In the instant case, the 
Police had not carried out any such exercise and therefore the 
court on the application of the petitioner issued the required 
declaration. The determination of age by the court is also a 
statutory obligation, hence the time spent in obtaining the said 
finding or declaration by the court cannot possibly be termed 
as delay caused in the trial by the accused, so as to deprive 
him of his right to bail on the ground of statutory delay. Any 
such determination of age by the court is a statutory 
requirement and forms part of the trial.”  
     
11. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner has not argued on the point 
that birth certificate or Form-B issued by NADRA and produced by 

Criminal Revision No. 83203  of 2023  
10
respondent No.2 before the trial court are forged documents. I have 
observed that according to birth certificate of Muhammad Hussain 
(respondent No.2) his date of birth is 20.05.2006 which was got 
entered in the record of Union Council Ahmad Pur East, District 
Bahawalpur on 30.05.2006, i.e. after ten days of his birth. Similarly, 
his Form-B was issued by NADRA on 03.10.2016 whereas the 
incident in the present case took place on 26.05.2023. Both the above 
mentioned documents are of much prior to the date of occurrence. 
Furthermore, even if it is presumed that there are contradictory 
documents qua the age of respondent No.2, i.e. birth certificate,  
Form-B issued by NADRA in favor of respondent No.2 and the 
school leaving certificate relied upon by petitioner, famous principle 
of criminal jurisdiction that in case where two views relating to the 
age of accused are possible, the view in favour of the accused is 
normally to be accepted as observed in the case-law reported as 
Muhammad Zubair vs. The State (2010 SCMR 182) comes to rescue 
the accused/respondent No.2. Relevant lines from the esteemed 
judgment are reproduced as under for ready reference:-  
“Be that as it may, the fact remains that there is a doubt in 
respect of the age of the appellant because according to him 
he was about 18 years of age whereas according to the 
complainant he was 20 years of age at the time of incident. In 
such a situation, it is to be seen as to whether doubt is to be 
decided in favour of the accused or the complainant. A 
similar question was examined by this Court in the case of 
“Ijaz Hussain vs. The State” 2002 SCMR 1455 and it after 
relying upon the case of “Umar Hayat v. Jahangir 2002 
SCMR 629 held that “in case where two views relating to 
the age of accused are possible, the view in favour of the 
accused is normally to be accepted. In the case of Sohail 
Iqbal v. the State 1993 SCMR 2377 it has been held as 
under:- 
In view of discrepancy in recording the age of 
appellant it is only fair that the benefits should 
be extended to him particularly in view of the 
precedent of this Court quoted by the learned 
counsel for the appellant i.e. Javed Iqbal v. The 
State 1982 SCMR 447. ”       

Criminal Revision No. 83203  of 2023

12. 
Other judgments cited by learned counsel for the petitioner are 
not applicable in this case because most of the case-laws are 
pertaining to repealed Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, 2000.  
13. 
As a natural corollary of above discussion, this Court has 
reached an irresistible conclusion that the trial court has passed a well- 
reasoned and speaking order after applying its judicial mind which 
needs no interference by this Court. Resultantly, instant criminal 
revision is hereby dismissed.  
14. 
Office is directed to send back the record of the trial court 
immediately.
