AALIA NEELUM, C.J:- The appellant-Babar alias Jani, 
son of Mukhtar Ahmad alias Mushtaq Ahmad, Caste Rehmani, resident of 
Street No.3, Lal Di Khurli, Farooq Ganj Jandiala Road, District 
Sheikhupura, has assailed his conviction and sentence recorded by the 
learned Additional Sessions Judge (MCTC), District Sheikhupura vide 
judgment dated 24.06.2021 in a private complaint filed under sections 302, 
34, 506-B PPC P.S. City B-Division, District Sheikhupura titled “Amanat 
Masih Vs. Babar alias Jani.” in case FIR No.547/2017, whereby the trial 
court convicted Babar alias Jani (the appellant) under Section 302 (b) 
PPC., and sentenced to Death for committing Qatl-e-Amd of Faisal Masih 
(the deceased), with the direction to pay compensation of Rs.10,00,000/- to 
the legal heirs of the deceased as envisaged under section 544-A of Cr.P.C 
and in case of default thereof, to undergo 06-months S.I further. 
2. 
 
Feeling aggrieved by the trial court's judgment, Babar alias 
Jani, the appellant, has assailed his conviction and sentence by filing the 
instant jail appeal bearing Criminal Appeal No.43616-J of 2021. The trial 
court also referred M.R. No.103 of 2021 (The State. Vs. Babar alias Jani) 

Murder Reference No.103 of 2021, 
Crl. Appeal No.43616-J of 2021

to confirm the death sentence awarded to the appellant-Babar alias Jani. 
Both the matters arising from the same judgment of the trial court are being 
disposed of through a single judgment. 
3. 
 
The prosecution story as contained in the private complaint (Ex. 
PB) filed by Amanat Masih (PW-1)-the complainant is that on 10.07.2017, 
at about 11:00 a.m, he was standing in front of Shahid Sweets to purchase 
vegetables in the meantime, his brother, Faisal Masih (the deceased), who 
was a rickshaw driver, came there on his rickshaw and stopped there for 
waiting the riders. In the meanwhile, the accused, Basharat Ali, along with 
Babar alias Jani, armed with Churri, came there while riding on a 
motorcycle Honda CD-70 and stopped the motorcycle near the rickshaw and 
after alighting from the motorcycle; the accused, Basharat, took Faisal 
Masih (the deceased) in (Japha) whereas the accused, Babar alias Jani (the 
appellant) inflicted Churri blows at the neck and right arm of Faisal Masih 
(the deceased); when the complainant along with his companions tried to 
step forward, the accused Basharat took out a pistol from the fold of his 
shalwar and extended life threats. After that, Faisal Masih succumbed to the 
injuries, whereas the accused persons fled away from the place of 
occurrence. The motive behind the occurrence was that Faisal Masih (the 
deceased) used to restrain the accused, Babar alias Jani, from developing 
illicit relations with his sister.   
4. 
 
After the incident, the complainant reported the matter to the 
police through his written application (Ex. PA). After that, formal F.I.R. (Ex. 
PF) was chalked out by Naveed Aslam, ASI (PW-4).  After registering the 
case, the investigation was initially entrusted to Shabbir Hussain (retired S.I) 
(CW-1). After that, Ahmad Anees S.I (CW-5) and Baqar Raza, ASI (CW-6) 
conducted the investigation; they found the accused/appellant guilty and 
prepared a report under section 173 of Cr.P.C. Being dissatisfied with the 
result of the investigation, as the investigating officer being in league with 
the accused did not investigate the matter properly, the complainant was 
constrained to file a private complaint (Ex. PB). After recording the cursory 
evidence of the complainant and having perused the record, the accused was 

Murder Reference No.103 of 2021, 
Crl. Appeal No.43616-J of 2021 
 
3
found connected with the commission of the offence, so he was summoned 
to face the charge. After that, the learned trial court formally charged the 
appellant on 23.11.2020, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. 
The complainant, in support of his version, produced as many as nine (09) 
witnesses, whereas the rest of the witnesses were summoned as court 
witnesses, i.e., CW.1 to CW.6. 
5. 
 
The ocular account, in this case, has come out from the 
statements of Amanat Masih (PW-1)-the complainant, and Ijaz Masih (PW-
2)-the eye witness, whereas Dr. Muhammad Ashfaq Ahmad (PW-8), who 
conducted the postmortem examination of Faisal Masih (the deceased) found 
the following injuries on his person: 
INJURIES 
1. 
An incised wound of 7x3.5 cm on the back of 
the neck., 8cm from the back of the ear, and 
8cm from the midclavicular line; the wound 
was muscle-deep.  
2. 
An incised wound of 7x3 cm on the left side 
of the upper neck and face, 2.5cm from the ear 
below, and 5cm from the lip margin. The 
wound was muscle-deep. 
3. 
An incised wound on the back of chest 5x3cm 
starting from midline between two shoulders 
bone 17 cm below the tip of lift shoulder on 
the left side. The wound was 3.5cm deep. 
4. 
An incised wound 3x5 cm on the right side of 
the back of the chest, 4cm from the midline, 
and 5cm from the tip of the shoulder bone. 
The wound was 2cm deep. 
5. 
An incised wound of 5x2 cm on the right side 
of the back of the chest, 5cm from the midline, 
and 6cm from the fourth injury. The wound 
was 0.5cm deep(superficial). 
6. 
There is an abrasion on the right side of the 
upper arm, 6cm from the axilla and 6cm in 
length. 

Murder Reference No.103 of 2021, 
Crl. Appeal No.43616-J of 2021 
 
4
7. 
An incised wound of 8x2cm on the upper part 
of the right thigh on the outer side. The wound 
was superficial. 
 
After conducting the postmortem examination, the 
doctor opined that injuries No.1 to 4 collectively, 
whereas injuries No.3 & 4 were partially sufficient to 
cause death in the ordinary course of nature. The death 
occurred due to severe hemorrhage and injury to vital 
organs that led to shock and cardiopulmonary arrest.  
The statements of the remaining prosecution witnesses are formal.  
6. 
 
The learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor gave up PWs 
Muhammad Salik, 389/C, being dead, and Nazir Ahmad, 1728/C, being 
unnecessary, and closed the prosecution evidence after tendering reports of 
Punjab Forensic Science Agency and Serology Analysis (Ex. PN and Ex. 
PO). 
7. 
 
The appellant was also examined in terms of Section 342 
Cr.P.C., wherein he neither opted to appear as his own witness in terms of 
Section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor produced any evidence in his defence. In 
response to a particular question about why this case was against him and 
why the PWs deposed against him, the appellant made the following 
deposition: - 
“PWs have falsely deposed against me to 
blackmail me and to extort money from me and 
to strengthen the false case against me. I had 
not participated in the alleged occurrence. I 
have been falsely roped in this case. All the 
private PWs are inter-se related to deceased 
and each other. A false motive has been set up 
against me. False and fake recoveries have been 
planted against me just to strengthen the case. 
Actually no recovery has been effected from me 
and I have no links with the alleged fake 
recoveries. The witnesses mentioned in the FIR 
and complainant had not seen the occurrence 
and they do not know the actual culprit. Co-
accused 
Basharat 
Ali 
has 
already 
been

Crl. Appeal No.43616-J of 2021 
 
5
acquitted from this case. I am innocent in this 
case and I may be acquitted from this case.”  
8. 
 
After evaluating the evidence available on record in light of 
arguments advanced from both sides, the learned trial court found the 
prosecution version proved beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt, which 
resulted in the appellant’s conviction in the afore-stated terms.  
9. 
 
Despite repeated calls, no one has entered an appearance on 
behalf of the appellant. So, Ms. Shahzadi Parveen, Advocate, is appointed as 
Defence counsel on behalf of the appellant at state expense.  
 
 
10. 
 
We have given our anxious and most thoughtful consideration 
to both sides’ rival submissions. We have minutely gone through the 
evidence on record.  
11. 
 
As per the prosecution case, the incident took place at 11:00 
a.m. on 10.07.2017 in front of Shahid Sweet situated at Farooq Ganj, 
Jandiala Road, Sheikhupura falling within the jurisdiction of Police Station 
City B-Division, Factory Area, District Sheikhupura and Faisal Masih, 
brother of Amanat Masih (PW-1)-the complainant, succumbed to the 
injuries at the spot. After the incident, Amanat Masih (PW-1)-the 
complainant, alongwith others, shifted the dead body of his brother Faisal 
Masih, the deceased, to the hospital. After that, the complainant went to the 
police station and reported the incident through the written application (Ex. 
PA) to Naveed Aslam A.S.I (PW-4), and FIR (Ex. PF) was chalked out at 
11:35 a.m. The inter-se distance between the place of occurrence and the 
police station is only one kilometer. Amanat Masih (PW-1)-the complainant 
deposed during cross-examination that: -   
“It is correct that we did not make phone call to 
Rescue 1122. We made phone call to Rescue 15, 
but I cannot produce the record regarding the 
same. It is correct that during my cross 
examination against co-accused Basharat (since 
acquitted) I had deposed that we did not make 
phone call to Rescue 1122 and 15. Neither myself 
nor other cited witness sustained any injury 
during the occurrence. We took the deceased 

Murder Reference No.103 of 2021, 
Crl. Appeal No.43616-J of 2021 
 
6
Faisal to DHQ Hospital Sheikhupura after the 
occurrence which took about fifteen minutes 
during shifting. Police officials came to the 
hospital. After dropping the dead body at DHQ 
Hospital Sheikhupura I went to the police station 
just after five minutes. I alongwith my uncle 
Waris Masih went to the police station. It took 
about five minutes to submit application for 
registration of case. Application for registration 
of case was got written by my uncle Waris Masih. 
It is correct that previously during cross 
examination of co-accused Basharat (since 
acquitted) I deposed that I could not tell the 
name of scribe of application for registration of 
case. Application for registration of case was 
submitted with due consciousness. We did not 
make any consultation before submission of 
application for registration of case. It is correct 
that previously, during cross-examination of co-
accused Basharat (since acquitted) I deposed that 
we submitted application for registration of case 
after due deliberation and the application was got 
written by one police official upon my direction.” 
 
 
The above deposition of Amanat Masih (PW-1), the 
complainant, reveals that he dishonestly improved his testimony. The scriber 
of the written complaint (Ex. PA), who was not known to the complainant in 
the earlier trial, was subsequently introduced by him as Waris Masih. The 
deposition of Amanat Masih (PW-1)-the complainant proves nothing 
substantial except he signed the information (Ex. PA), whereof FIR (Ex. PF) 
was registered. The FIR (Ex. PF) is the result of deliberation and 
consultation, which was also revealed from the inquest report (Ex. CW-1/B), 
wherein, in column No.3 relating to the date and time of receiving 
information about the death, the date 10.07.2017 was mentioned and after 
writing “بوقت” space was left blank. Shabbir Hussain (retired S.I) (CW-1)-
the investigating officer has not mentioned the time of preparing the inquest 
report. Shabbir Hussain (retired S.I) (CW-1)-the investigating officer, 
deposed during the examination-in-chief, that the investigation was entrusted 
to him after the registration of the case and FIR (Ex. PF) was registered at 
11:25 a.m. He (CW-1), alongwith Muhammad Ramzan/C, Muhammad 
Ashfaq/C (PW-9), and Muhammad Salik/C, went to the DHQ Hospital

Sheikhupura; the dead body of Faisal Masih was lying in the Trauma Centre, 
where he captured photographs of the deceased with his mobile phone; he 
(CW-1) inspected the dead body and prepared its injury statement 
(Exh.CW.1/A), inquest report (Exh.CW.1/B) and also prepared an 
application (Exh.CW.1/C) for getting postmortem examination of the dead 
body of Faisal Masih, the deceased; he (CW-1) handed over police papers 
alongwith dead body to Muhammad Ashfaq constable (PW-9) for getting its 
autopsy. Whereas, during cross-examination, Shabbir Hussain (retired S.I) 
(CW-1) deposed that: - 
“I went to the place of occurrence from the police 
station. I interrogated the matter at the place of 
occurrence. Thereafter, I may be went to the 
hospital for postmortem. It is incorrect to suggest 
that firstly I visited the hospital and thereafter I 
went to the place of occurrence.” 
 
 
Dr. Muhammad Ashfaq Ahmad (PW-8) deposed that on 
10.07.2017, he was posted at DHQ Hospital Sheikhupura; on the same day, 
dead body of Faisal Masih was brought by Muhammad Ashfaq 1644/C (PW-
9) at 12:15 PM and he conducted postmortem examination on the dead body 
of Faisal Masih at 06:20 p.m. Whereas, during cross-examination Dr. 
Muhammad Ashfaq Ahmad (PW-8) admitted that the dead body was 
received at 12:15 p.m, whereas police papers were received at 06:00 p.m. 
There was no delay on his part in conducting postmortem examination. The 
deposition of Dr. Muhammad Ashfaq Ahmad (PW-8) and perusal of 
contents of the postmortem report (Ex. PK) reveal that complete police 
papers were received at 06:00 p.m. on 10.07.2017, although Shabbir Hussain 
(Retired S.I) (CW-1), deposed that after registration of the case, he visited 
the hospital, prepared documents and referred the dead body alongwith 
documents to the hospital through Muhammad Ashfaq/C (PW-9). As per the 
postmortem report (Ex. PK), the time elapsed between death and 
postmortem was about 06 hours, whereas, from the time of occurrence, there 
is a delay of 07 hours and 20 minutes. Dr. Muhammad Ashfaq Ahmad (PW-
8) stated that he issued postmortem report (Ex. PK) and also attested 
application for postmortem examination, injury statement, and inquest report 

Murder Reference No.103 of 2021, 
Crl. Appeal No.43616-J of 2021 
 
8
relating to Faisal Masih, the deceased prepared by the I.O. If FIR was 
registered within 25 minutes, there is no plausible explanation as to why the 
postmortem examination was conducted with the delay. The delay in 
conducting the postmortem examination reflects that the FIR was recorded 
with the delay and was not recorded at the time it was claimed to be 
recorded. It appears that till the completion of the postmortem report, the 
FIR was not registered, which leads to the irresistible conclusion that the 
FIR was recorded with the delay and that the same cannot be used against 
the appellant as a corroborative piece of evidence.  
12. 
 
There is another aspect of the case that leads to the conclusion 
that the incident was not witnessed by the prosecution witnesses, i.e., 
Amanat Masih (PW-1)-the complainant, and Ijaz Masih (PW-2)-the 
eyewitness. As per the prosecution case, Faisal Masih, the deceased, stopped 
his rickshaw in front of Shahid Sweets for the riders. In the meanwhile, Ijaz 
Masih (PW-2), the brother of the complainant, who was also a rickshaw 
driver, arrived with Chand Masih and Salamat Masih (given up PWs) and 
stopped their rickshaw in front of Shahid Sweet for riders. Meanwhile, 
Basharat (co-accused since acquitted) while riding on motorcycle C.D-70 
came there, and the appellant (Babar alias Jani) pillion rider, having a knife 
in his hand; Basharat (since acquitted) stopped his motorcycle near the 
rickshaw of Faisal Masih (the deceased) and after getting off from 
motorcycle, Basharat (co-accused since acquitted) caught hold Faisal Masih 
and the appellant inflicted knife blows on the neck and the right arm of 
Faisal Masih. The complainant (PW-1), alongwith companions, stepped 
forward to rescue Faisal Masih, the deceased, then Basharat (co-accused 
since acquitted) took out a pistol from the fold of his Shalwar and threatened 
them not to step forward. Otherwise, they would be done to death. Amanat 
Masih (PW-1)-the complainant, and Ijaz Masih (PW-2)-the eyewitness, 
deposed in similar lines. Amanat Masih (PW-1)-the complainant deposed 
during cross-examination that: - 
“Accused Basharat caught hold of deceased 
Faisal Masih whereas accused Babar present in 

Murder Reference No.103 of 2021, 
Crl. Appeal No.43616-J of 2021 
 
9
the court gave churri blows upon right arms and 
neck of the deceased.” 
Ijaz Masih (PW-2)-the eye witness also deposed during cross-examination 
that:- 
“When accused Babar made churri blows upon 
neck and right arm of deceased Faisal till such 
period co-accused Basharat caught hold of 
deceased Faisal and thereafter, both of them fled 
away.” 
 
 
Whereas Dr. Muhammad Ashfaq Ahmad (PW-8) observed four 
injuries, i.e., injuries No.1, 3, 4 & 5, on the back of Faisal Masih, the 
deceased. The doctor opined that injuries No.1, 2, 3 & 4 collectively and 3 & 
4 partially were enough to cause the death of a person in the ordinary course 
of nature and injuries No.3 & 4 are on the back of the chest of Faisal Masih, 
the deceased. Dr. Muhammad Ashfaq Ahmad (PW-8) deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
 “No injury was caused from the front side to 
the deceased.”  
Ijaz Masih (PW-2) deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“We did not catch hold of deceased Faisal but 
we shifted him to the hospital at Rickshaw.” 
 
 
It is not possible that if Basharat (co-accused since acquitted) 
was holding Faisal Masih, the deceased, then the appellant could have 
inflicted the injuries on his back. Dr. Muhammad Ashfaq Ahmad (PW-8) 
stated explicitly that the injuries were not inflicted from the front; relatively 
the same were caused from the back. This also creates doubt about the 
genuineness of the version given by PWs, i.e., Amanat Masih (PW-1)-the 
complainant, and Ijaz Masih (PW-2)-the eyewitness. Thus, the prosecution 
version is contradicted by medical evidence, which affects the core of the 
prosecution’s case and renders the witness's testimony liable to be 
discredited.  
13. 
 
Per the prosecution case, the complainant (PW-1) for fetching 
vegetables was standing in front of Shahid Sweet at 11:00 a.m.; Faisal Masih 

Murder Reference No.103 of 2021, 
Crl. Appeal No.43616-J of 2021 
 
10
(the deceased) reached in front of Shahid Sweets and also stopped in search 
of riders. Similarly, Ijaz Masih (PW-2), brother of the complainant, rickshaw 
driver, along with Chand Masih and Salamat Masih (given up PWs), also 
stopped in front of Shahid Sweet in search of riders. Meanwhile, Basharat 
(co-accused since acquitted) and the appellant arrived at the spot-on 
motorcycle C.D-70, and the occurrence occurred. The scaled site plan (Ex. 
PG) was prepared on the instructions of both the prosecution witnesses, i.e., 
Amanat Masih (PW-1)-the complainant, and Ijaz Masih (PW-2)-the 
eyewitness. Amanat Masih (PW-1)-the complainant deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“It is correct that the owner of vegetable shop is 
not cited witness in the occurrence. It is correct 
that Shahid Sweet shop is lying across the road of 
vegetable shop. There might be distance of 60 feet 
between Shahid Sweet shop and vegetable shop. 
It is also correct that owner of Shahid Sweet shop 
is also not cited witness in the occurrence. ---------
I was present in front of Shahid Sweet shop at 
10:30 a.m. Thereafter, Ejaz Masih and Chand 
witnesses also reached there at 10.35/10.40 a.m. 
Ejaz Masih and Chand reached at the spot 
separately 
while 
riding 
upon 
Chingchi 
Rickshaws. Thereafter five minutes accused 
Babar (present in the court under police custody) 
and Basharat (since acquitted) reached at the 
place of occurrence.” 
Ijaz Masih (PW-2)-the eye witness deposed during cross-examination that:- 
“Distance between Shahid Sweet and vegetable 
shop is about 20 spaces. I alongwith Amanat and 
Chand were present in front of Shahid Sweet. It 
is correct that Shahid Sweet shop is lying towards 
western side of alleged place of occurrence. 
Witness Amanat masih was present prior to 
presence of other witnesses at Shahid Sweet shop. 
Deceased Faisal came about two minutes after 
my presence at Shahid Sweet shop. Thereafter 
accused Babar present in the court in custody 
and co-accused Basharat (since acquitted) came 
within period of one minutes after reaching of 
deceased Faisal at the place of occurrence. We 

Murder Reference No.103 of 2021, 
Crl. Appeal No.43616-J of 2021 
 
11
did not manage to escape from place of 
occurrence after seeing the accused party.” 
 
 
Whereas, in the scaled site plan (Ex. PG & Ex.PG/1), the 
presence of the deceased was shown at point “B,” while the complainant 
(PW-1) was shown at point “D,” and PWs Ijaz Masih and Chand Masih 
were present at point “E” and from point “F,” accused Babar (the appellant) 
and Basharat reached and after the incident, fled away. In the scaled site 
plans (Ex. PG & Ex.PG/1), the place of occurrence was shown in front of the 
vegetable shop of Malik Khalid Mehmood, and the deceased, prosecution 
witnesses and the accused were not present in front of Shahid Sweet. 
Muhammad Riaz (PW-5)-draftsman deposed during cross-examination that:- 
“When I visited the place of occurrence 
complainant and witnesses were present there. 
Shahid sweet is situated on the Western Side of 
main road known as Jandiala Road leading 
from city Sheikhupura to Jandiala Sher Khan.--
---------Place of occurrence is situated in front of 
vegetable shop owned by Malik Khalid 
Mehmood. There is a road on North East Side 
of place of occurrence whereas shops are 
situated in Northern Side. The distance between 
point A to Shahid Sweet is about 82 feet. I have 
shown point D in my scaled site plan from 
where complainant had seen the occurrence.”  
 
 
The evidence of both the prosecution witnesses, i.e., Amanat 
Masih (PW-1)-the complainant, and Ijaz Masih (PW-2), is unreliable and not 
trustworthy regarding their presence at the place of occurrence. Although, 
the site plan is not a substantive piece of evidence according to Article 22 of 
the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, as held in the case of “Mst. Shamim 
Akhtar v. Fiaz Akhtar and two others” (PLD 1992 SC 211), yet it reflects 
the view of the crime scene, and the same can be used to contradict or 
disbelieve eyewitnesses. So, the prosecution witnesses could not justify their 
presence at the spot. Thus, all the evidence about the presence of Amanat 
Masih (PW-1)-the complainant, and Ijaz Masih (PW-2) at the spot appears 
unreliable. With this background, the presence of the alleged eyewitnesses 
on the spot seems doubtful. This grave infirmity destroys the credibility of 

Murder Reference No.103 of 2021, 
Crl. Appeal No.43616-J of 2021 
 
12
the evidence of witnesses. If the evidence of these witnesses is rejected as 
untrustworthy, nothing survives the prosecution case. These are the material 
contradictions in the ocular evidence and documentary evidence. 
14. 
 
So far as the motive set up by the prosecution in the application 
(Exh. PA), FIR (Exh. PF), and private complaint (Exh. PB) and deposed 
about it by Amanat Masih (PW-1), the complainant and Ijaz Masih (PW-2)-
the eyewitness, we have found it to have remained un-proved. The 
prosecution case in this regard was vague and could hardly inspire 
confidence. Amanat Masih (PW-1)-the complainant had deposed during 
cross-examination that: - 
 “It is correct that the name of my sister, with 
whom motive of illicit relations with accused 
Babar was attached, is not mentioned either in 
the FIR or in the private complaint and she also 
did not join the investigation.”  
Ijaz Masih (PW-2)-the eyewitness, had deposed during cross-examination 
that: - 
 “My sister with whom motive was attached 
that Babar was trying to have illicit relations 
with her did not appear during investigation.”  
Shabbir Hussain (retired S.I) (CW-1)-the investigating officer had deposed 
during cross-examination that: -  
 “The woman relating to motive part of the 
occurrence mentioned in the FIR was not 
produced before me by the complainant and 
her whereabouts and particulars were also not 
provided to me during investigation. I myself 
could not trace out her particulars as the 
complainant did not intent to disclose about 
her.”  
Ahmad Anees SI (CW-5)-the investigating officer deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“Woman relating to motive part mentioned in 
the FIR was not produced before me by the 
complainant.” 

Murder Reference No.103 of 2021, 
Crl. Appeal No.43616-J of 2021 
 
13
 
 
In the circumstances, we cannot avoid the conclusion that the 
motive, as alleged, was an afterthought and has not been proved by any 
credible evidence. Even, the trial court has already disbelieved the motive 
set up by the prosecution.  
15. 
 
As far as recovery of weapon of offence, i.e., churri (P-6) on the 
pointing of Babar alias Jani-the appellant, on 15.08.2020 and positive report 
of Punjab Forensic Science Agency (Ex. PO) regarding the presence of 
human blood on the blade of churri, are concerned, as per the prosecution 
case, on 06.08.2020, the accused was arrested. Upon the disclosure of the 
appellant on 15.08.2020, a churri (P-6) was recovered from the opposite 
railway station near Tower Railway, Sheikhupura. The statements of Syed 
Waqas Ali Naqvi 1393/C (CW-2) and Ahmad Anees S.I. (CW-5) and on 
perusal of the recovery memo (Exh.CW-2/A) reveal that after the recovery 
of Churri (P-6) which was wrapped in shopper, same was taken into custody 
through sealed parcel. However, it is not mentioned in the Forensic DNA 
and Serology Analysis Report (Ex. P.O) that the sealed parcel was 
submitted. Besides, the Punjab Forensic Science Agency Report (Ex. PO) 
reveals that: - 
“Property in this case was released to Ahmed 
Anees (SI) on August 19, 2020.” 
The swabs taken from the blade of Churri (P-6) were examined on October 
29, 2020. If the property of the instant case was released to Ahmad Anees 
S.I. (CW-5) on 19.08.2020, then which case property was analyzed by the 
Analyst on October 29, 2020, creates doubt on the report of Punjab Forensic 
Science Agency, Lahore (Ex. PO). Ahmad Anees S.I. (CW-5)-investigating 
officer deposed during examination-in-chief that: - 
 “On 19.08.2020, Moharrar Muhammad Anwar 
handed me a parcel of churri for its onward 
transmission to the office of PFSA which I 
submitted in the concerned office, intact, on the 
same day. On returning to the police station, I 
recorded statement of Muhammad Anwar 
Moharrar u/s 161 Cr.P.C. in this regard.”

The entire prosecution evidence is silent on this aspect of the 
case. Thus, there was no link evidence to prove that the Churri (P-6) 
recovered from the accused was again received back from Ahmad Anees S.I. 
(CW-5)-the investigating officer by the moharrar and the same was re-
deposited in the Malkhana or handed over to the Moharrar. It is necessary 
that as and when case property is taken out from Malkhana, necessary entry 
is made in the Malkhana Register and at the time when case property is re-
deposited in Malkhana. Case property in murder cases must be kept in safe 
custody from the date of seizure till its production in the Court. It is also 
necessary that when case property is re-deposited in the Malkhana, an entry 
in the Malkhana Register must be made. A dire necessity has been cast upon 
the prosecution to produce in Court the abstract of the Malkhana Register for 
ensuring, dispelling, of any aura of skepticism seeping into the prosecution 
case, especially vis-a-vis safe custody of the case property, "being," re-
deposited in the Malkhana. Thus, it casts doubt on whether it is the same 
case property that was recovered from the accused and sent to Forensic 
Science Laboratory or it was the case property of some other case. The 
prosecution has failed to prove the case against the accused. Pointing out the 
above deposition of witnesses reveals that the prosecution did not prove that 
case property (P-6) was kept in safe custody. Due to the lack of this 
evidence, it cannot be held that the alleged recovered “Churri” (P-6) was re-
deposited in Malkhana, and its benefit will go to the accused. Therefore, 
there is an absolute glaring contradiction in the testimony of the prosecution 
witnesses, and this vital contradiction remains unexplained. The case 
property produced in the court could not be related to the case property 
seized from the appellant's possession. There is, thus, no evidence to connect 
the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Ex. PO), with the Churri (P-
6). All these circumstances taken together only deepen the shadows of doubt 
cast upon the case of prosecution.

Now, coming to the abscondance of the appellant till 
06.08.2020, we have noticed that warrant of arrest (Ex. PL) was issued on 
19.12.2017 and proclamation under Section 87 Cr.P.C. against the appellant 

Murder Reference No.103 of 2021, 
Crl. Appeal No.43616-J of 2021

was issued while mentioning address of the appellant in the same and 
Shabbir Hussain (retired S.I) (CW-1)-the investigating officer admitted 
during cross-examination about the address of the appellant that: - 
“I did not visit the house of Babar accused. 
Volunteered that no such house of Babar could 
be traced out.” 
 
 
The deposition of Shabbir Hussain (retired S.I) (CW-1)-the 
investigating officer, creates doubts about the proceedings for declaring the 
appellant absconder by Shabbir Hussain (retired S.I) (CW-1)-the 
investigating officer. Moreover, considering our findings regarding the 
ocular account furnished by the prosecution, the medical evidence, and the 
evidence of motive, we believe that the absconding cannot be taken as proof 
of guilt if sufficient connecting evidence against the appellant is unavailable. 
In this respect, reference can be made to the “Barkat Ali v. Muhammad 
Asif and others” (2007 SCMR 1812). Even otherwise, by now, it is an 
established proposition of law that the absconding creates merely a suspicion 
in mind, but the same is not conclusive proof of guilt. Reliance in this 
respect is placed on the case of “Rasool Muhammad v. Asal Muhammad 
and another” (PLJ 1995 SC 477). However, mere absconsion of the 
accused is no ground to convict him if the prosecution has failed to prove its 
case against the accused. 
17. 
 
All the above-narrated facts and circumstances lead this Court 
to only one conclusion: the whole prosecution case seems to be hinging 
upon conjectures and surmises and has severely failed to show 
incriminating, corroborative/independent evidence to bring home guilt of the 
accused in the case of capital charge. The learned trial court was unjustified 
in convicting the appellant while relying on untrustworthy, unsubstantiated 
evidence. The conviction passed by the learned trial court in the 
circumstances is against all cannons of law recognized for dispensing 
criminal justice.  Per the dictates of the law, the benefit of every doubt will 
be extended in favor of the accused.  In the case of “Muhammad Akram  v. 
The State” (2009 SCMR 230), it has been held as under: - 

Murder Reference No.103 of 2021, 
Crl. Appeal No.43616-J of 2021

“The nutshell of the whole discussion is that the 
prosecution case is not free from doubt. It is an 
axiomatic principle of law that in case of doubt, 
the benefit thereof must accrue in favor of the 
accused as matter of right and not of grace. It 
was observed by this Court in the case of Tariq 
Pervez v. The State 1995 SCMR 1345 that for 
giving the benefit of doubt, it was not necessary 
that there should be many circumstances 
creating doubts. If there is circumstance which 
created reasonable doubt in a prudent mind 
about the guilt of the accused, then the accused 
would be entitled to the benefit of doubt not as a 
matter of grace and concession but as a matter 
of right.” 
 
 
The golden principle of law is that the Court should let off a 
hundred guilty but not convict one innocent person.  In the case of “Ayub 
Masih  v.  The State” (PLD 2002 SC 1048), it has been held by the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan that: - 
“----It is hardly necessary to reiterate that the 
prosecution is obliged to prove its case against the 
accused beyond any reasonable doubt and if it 
fails to do so the accused is entitled to the benefit 
of doubt as of right. It is also firmly settled that if 
there is an element of doubt as to the guilt of the 
accused the benefit of that doubt must be extended 
to him. The doubt of course must be reasonable 
and not imaginary or artificial. The rule of benefit 
of doubt, which is described as the golden rule, is 
essentially a rule of prudence which can not be 
ignored while dispensing justice in accordance 
with law. It is based on the maxim, “it is better 
that ten guilty persons be acquitted rather than one 
innocent person be convicted”. 
 In simple words it means that utmost care should 
be taken by the Court in convicting an accused. It 
has further been held in “The State  v.  Mushtaq 
Ahmed” (PLD 1973 SC 418) that this rule is 
antithesis of haphazard approach or reaching a 
fitful decision in a case. It will not be out of place 
to mention here that this rule occupies a pivotal 
place in the Islamic law and is enforced rigorously 
in view of the saying of the Holy Prophet 
(P.B.U.H) that the “mistake of Qazi (Judge) in 

Murder Reference No.103 of 2021,

17
releasing a criminal is better than his mistake in 
punishing an innocent”.  
 
18. 
 
The upshot of the above discussion is that the prosecution had 
severely failed to bring home a charge against the appellant beyond any 
reasonable doubt; therefore, in the interest of the safe administration of 
Criminal Justice, Crl. Appeal No.43616-J of 2021 filed by Babar alias Jani, 
the appellant, is accepted in toto. The sentence awarded by the learned 
Additional Sessions Judge (MCTC), District Sheikhupura, vide judgment 
dated 24.06.2021, is set aside, and the appellant is acquitted of the charge in 
a private complaint filed under sections 302/34, 506(B) PPC P.S. City B-
Division, District Sheikhupura titled “Amanat Masih Vs. Babar alias Jani, 
etc.”. The appellant-Babar alias Jani, son of Mukhtar Ahmad alias Mushtaq 
Ahmad, is ordered to be released forthwith, if not required in any other case. 
Murder Reference No.103 of 2021 is answered in the negative, and the 
sentence of death awarded to Babar alias Jani, son of Mukhtar Ahmad alias 
Mushtaq Ahmad, caste Rehmani, resident of Street No.3, Lal Di Khurli, 
Farooq Ganj Jandiala Road, District Sheikhupura (convict), is Not 
Confirmed.
