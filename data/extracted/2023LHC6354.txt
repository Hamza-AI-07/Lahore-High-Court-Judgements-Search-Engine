Raheel Kamran, J. The petitioner has assailed 
recovery of Rs.759,059,945/- from the accounts of the petitioner 
maintained at HBL and Standard Chartered Bank in purported 
exercise of authority under section 140 of the Income Tax 
Ordinance, 2001 (‘The Ordinance’) without issuance of prior notice 
under section 138(1) of the Ordinance after dismissal of appeal of 
the petitioner by the Commissioner, Inland Revenue (Appeals).  A 
prayer for the return of the aforementioned amount recovered from 
the petitioner has also been made.  
2.  
The facts of the case briefly are that the petitioner namely 
Pakistan Branch of the China Machinery Engineering Corporation 
(CMEC) having been registered with the Securities and Exchange 

2 
W. P. No.29586 of 2023 
Commission of Pakistan filed its e-return of income for the tax year 
2021 declaring a loss of Rs.691,446,147/- upon which respondent 
No.5 issued a notice dated 18.04.2022 under section 122(9) read 
with section122(5A) of the Ordinance to amend the assessment. 
After affording an opportunity of hearing, ammended assessment 
order was passed on 24.11.2022 determining the income of the 
petitioner as Rs.25,252,330,012/- for the recovery of tax of an 
amount of Rs.6,881,058,090/- and thus, issued a notice under section 
137(2) of the Ordinance for payment of the tax payable.  The 
aforementioned amended assessment order was assailed in appeal on 
13.12.2022 wherein stay was granted restraining recovery of the 
impugned demand, which was ultimately extended on 06.04.2023 
for thirty days. During subsistence of the stay order, respondent 
No.5 issued notice dated 26.04.2023 in purported exercise of 
authority under section 138(1) of the Ordinance for the payment of 
tax by 28.04.2023. On 03.05.2023, respondent No.3 decided appeal 
of the petitioner while confirming the assessment order and on the 
same day, after issuing notice under section 140 of the Ordinance 
read with Rule 69 of the Income Tax Rules, 2002, respondents No.2 
to 5 recovered an amount of Rs.759,059,945/- as the tax due from 
the two bank accounts of the petitioner.  Against the order of 
Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals), the petitioner also filed an 
appeal before the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) 
wherein stay of 30 days was granted. It is claimed that respondents 
No.2 to 5 issued a recovery notice to Punjab Thermal Power (Pvt.) 
Ltd (respondent No.6) which is owner of the project. Meanwhile, it 
has been apprised, appeal of the petitioner was dismissed by the 
ATIR, and Income Tax Reference Application of the petitioner has 
been entertained by the Division Bench of this Court wherein 
interim relief has also been granted against recovery of the tax 
assessed. The instant petition essentially calls into question 
jurisdiction of respondents No. 2 to 5 to recover the amount of 

3 
W. P. No.29586 of 2023 
Rs.759,059,945/- from bank accounts of the petitioner in purported 
exercise of authority under Section 140 of the Ordinance.  
3.  
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that during 
pendency of the appeal preferred by the petitioner before the 
Commissioner Inland Revenue, stay order against recovery was 
extended for 30 days or till the decision of the appeal, whichever 
was earlier. During pendency of the stay order, notice for recovery 
under section 138(1) was issued on 26.04.2023 by the Assistant 
Commissioner/Deputy Commissioner, Inland Revenue with due date 
specified therein as 28.04.2023. Such notice was issued without 
lawful authority in the presence of a stay order passed by the 
Commissioner, Inland Revenue (Appeals). He adds that nothing was 
due at that juncture, therefore, the mandatory prerequisite of section 
138(1) i.e. recovery of the amount due on the date of issuance of the 
notice was non-existent. He further contends that appeal of the 
petitioner was dismissed at 12:06 p.m. on 03.05.2023 by the 
Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals), whereas recovery of the 
aforementioned amount was effected at 2:00 p.m. from the bank 
accounts maintained by the petitioner with respondents No.7 and 8. 
According to him, not only fresh notice under section 138(1) of the 
Ordinance was to be issued for the amount which had become due in 
consequence of dismissal of appeal of the petitioner by the 
Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) but also a reasonable time, 
being not less than 7 days, was to be allowed to the petitioner to 
avail the remedy of appeal before the Appellate Tribunal Inland 
Revenue before effecting the impugned recovery.  It is finally 
contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner that provisions of 
section 48 of the Ordinance are pari materia with those of section 
137 of the Ordinance which has also been construed in a manner that 
fresh notice is required to be issued on re-assessment made by 
taxation officer.  In support of above contentions, learned counsel 
for the petitioner has placed reliance on judgments in the cases of 
Mubashir Yameen v. Assistant/Deputy Commissioner Inland 

4 
W. P. No.29586 of 2023 
Revenue, RTO, Rawalpindi and others (2023 PTD 146), Messrs 
Pakistan LNG Limited through Authorized Representative vs. 
Federation of Pakistan, through Secretary Revenue Division, 
Ministry of Finance, Islamabad and 2 others (2022 PTD 1763), 
Sungi Development Foundation Employees Provident Fund Trustees 
v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Ministry of Finance, 
Revenue and Economic Affairs and others (2022 PTD 1690), Mst. 
Fouzia Razzak v. Federal Board of Revenue and others (2021 PTD 
162), Quaid-e-Azam Thermal Private Limited through Chief 
Executive Officer, Lahore v. Federal Board of Revenue through 
Chairman, Lahore and others (2020 PTD 165) and Messrs Huawei 
Technologies Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Commissioner Inland Revenue 
and others (2016 PTD 1799). 
4.  
Conversely, Barrister Ahmad Pervez, learned counsel for 
the revenue authorities states that order in original determined tax 
liability 
of 
the 
petitioner 
in 
the 
sum 
of 
Rs.6.8-Billion 
(approximately) on 24.11.2022. According to him, the interim relief 
granted in favour of the petitioner was to the effect that recovery of 
the impugned demand was stayed. He maintains that neither the 
order in original was suspended nor was there any injunction against 
issuance of the notice under section 138(1) of the Ordinance, 
therefore, the notice was properly issued on 26.04.2023 in 
accordance with law.  He adds that the determined liability existed 
when the stay order was granted, therefore, recovery of the amount 
was subject to the outcome of the appeal.  He further contends that 
in the judgments relied upon by learned counsel for the petitioner, 
all that was held that it was mandatory to issue notice under section 
138 of the Ordinance before invoking provisions of section 140 of 
the Ordinance which requirement has been complied with in the 
instant case as notice under section 138(1) of the Ordinance was 
issued on 26.04.2023 and that the recovery was made 7 days 
thereafter, on the day when the appeal was dismissed and tax 
liability of the petitioner was upheld by the Commissioner Inland 

5 
W. P. No.29586 of 2023 
Revenue (Appeals). He finally states that the requirement of a fresh 
notice may be warranted in cases where tax liability is modified, 
however, law does not envisage repeated issuance of notice under 
section 138 of the Ordinance.  
5.  
Learned counsel for respondent No.6 has emphasized that 
the notice under section 138(1) dated 26.04.2023 specified the due 
date to be 28.04.2023 for recovery of the amount of tax specified 
therein whereas at that stage appeal of the petitioner was still sub-
judice and stay against recovery was in field.  He adds that service 
of fresh notice under section 138(1) of the Ordinance, after decision 
of the appellate authority, is necessary for the reason explained in 
paragraphs 14 and 15 of the judgment in the case of Messrs Pakistan 
LNG Limited through Authorized Representative vs. Federation of 
Pakistan, through Secretary Revenue Division, Ministry of Finance, 
Islamabad and 2 others (2022 PTD 1763).

Sections 137, 138 and 140 read with section 124 of the 
Ordinance are provisions that relate to the mechanism for recovery 
of tax after an assessment is made.  In order to properly appreciate 
the scope of above provisions, the same are reproduced herein 
below: - 
“137. Due date for payment of tax.-- (1) The tax payable by a 
taxpayer on the taxable income of the taxpayer [including the tax 
payable under section 113 or 113A] for a tax year shall be due on the 
due date for furnishing the taxpayer’s return of income for that year.  
 
(2) Where any tax is payable under an assessment order or an 
amended assessment order or any other order issued by the 
Commissioner under this Ordinance, a notice shall be served upon the 
taxpayer in the prescribed form specifying the amount payable and 
thereupon the sum so specified shall be paid within thirty days from 
the date of service of the notice.  
 
Provided that the due date for payment of tax payable under sub- 
section (7) of section 147 shall be the date specified in sub-section (5) 
or sub-section (5A) or first proviso to sub-section (5B) of section 147.

W. P. No.29586 of 2023 
  
138. Recovery of tax out of property and through arrest of taxpayer.-
- (1) For the purpose of recovering any tax due by a taxpayer, the 
Commissioner may serve upon the taxpayer a notice in the prescribed 
form requiring him to pay the said amount within such time as may be 
specified in the notice.  
 
(2) If the amount referred to in the notice issued under sub-
section (1) is not paid within the time specified therein or within the 
further time, if any, allowed by the Commissioner, the Commissioner 
may proceed to recover from the taxpayer the said amount by one or 
more of the following modes, namely:--  
(a) attachment and sale of any movable or immovable property of the 
taxpayer;  
(b) appointment of a receiver for the management of the movable or 
immovable property of the taxpayer;  
(c) arrest of the taxpayer and his detention in prison for a period not 
exceeding six months; and  
(d) as specified under clauses (a), (ca) and (d) of sub-section (I) of section 
48 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990.  
 
 
(3) For the purposes of recovery of tax under sub-section (2), the 
Commissioner shall have the same powers as a Civil Court has under 
the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Act V of 1908), for the purposes of 
the recovery of any amount due under a decree.  
 
(4) The Board may make rules regulating the procedure for the 
recovery of tax under this section and any other matter connected 
with, or incidental to, the operation of this section. 
 
140. Recovery of tax from persons holding money on behalf of a 
taxpayer.-- (1) For the purpose of recovering any tax due by a 
taxpayer, the Commissioner may, by notice, in writing, require any 
person-- 
 
(a) owing or who may owe money to the taxpayer; or  
(b) holding or who may hold money for, or on account of the 
taxpayer;  
(c) holding or who may hold money on account of some other 
person for payment to the taxpayer; or  
(d) having authority of some other person to pay money to the 
taxpayer,  
to pay to the Commissioner so much of the money as set out in the 
notice by the date set out in the notice. 
 
Provided that the Commissioner shall not issue notice under this 
sub-section for recovery of any tax due from a taxpayer if the said 
taxpayer has filed an appeal under section 127 in respect of the order 
under which the tax sought to be recovered has become payable and 
the appeal has not been decided by the Commissioner (Appeals), 
subject to the condition that ten per cent of the said amount of tax due 
has been paid by the taxpayer.  
 
 
(2) Subject to sub-section (3), the amount set out in a notice 
under subsection (1) –  
(a) where the amount of the money is equal to or less than the   
amount of tax due by the taxpayer, shall not exceed the 
amount of the money; or  
(b) in any other case, shall be so much of the money as is 
sufficient to pay the amount of tax due by the taxpayer.  
 
 
(3) Where a person is liable to make a series of payments (such 
as salary) to a taxpayer, a notice under sub-section (1) may specify an 

7 
W. P. No.29586 of 2023 
amount to be paid out of each payment until the amount of tax due by 
the taxpayer has been paid.  
 
(4) The date for payment specified in a notice under sub-section 
(1) shall not be a date before the money becomes payable to the 
taxpayer or held on the taxpayer’s behalf. 
 
(5) The provisions of sections 160, 161, 162 and 163, so far as 
may be, shall apply to an amount due under this section as if the 
amount were required to be deducted from a payment under Division 
III of Part V of this Chapter.  
 
(6) Any person who has paid any amount in compliance with a 
notice under sub-section (1) shall be treated as having paid such 
amount under the authority of the taxpayer and the receipt of the 
Commissioner constitutes a good and sufficient discharge of the 
liability of such person to the taxpayer to the extent of the amount 
referred to in such receipt.  
 
(10) In this section, "person" includes any Court, Tribunal or 
any other authority.” 
 
From perusal of section 137 ibid, it is manifest that its provisions 
outline due dates for the payment of tax under various provisions of 
the Ordinance.  Sections 138 and 140 ibid provide mechanisms for 
the recovery of tax due from a taxpayer. Section 138(1) of the 
Ordinance manifestly postulates that for every recovery of the tax 
due, notice has to be served upon the taxpayer requiring him to pay 
the said amount within the time specified therein. Subsection (2) of 
section 138 of the Ordinance allows the Commissioner Inland 
Revenue to recover the amount under subsection (1), if not paid 
within the time specified in the notice under section 138(1) ibid by 
invoking one or more of the coercive modes of recovery of tax out 
of property or arrest of the taxpayer whereas section 140 ibid 
provides for the mode of such recovery of tax from a person holding 
money on behalf of the taxpayer.  
8.  
The issues for determination of this Court are: firstly, 
whether a notice issued to a taxpayer under section 138(1) of the 
Ordinance for the recovery of tax due during subsistence of a stay 
order is valid and lawful? and secondly, whether, after an amended 
assessment order has been upheld by the Commissioner Inland 
Revenue (Appeals) or the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue, the 
tax authorities are required to serve upon the taxpayer a fresh notice 
under section 138(1) of the Ordinance requiring him to pay the 

8 
W. P. No.29586 of 2023 
amount of tax due within the time specified therein before invoking 
coercive mechanism under section 138(2) or 140 of the Ordinance?    
9.  
Section 140 of the Ordinance does not contain any non-
obstante clause to give it effect overriding the provisions of section 
138 of the Ordinance, therefore, the requirement of prior notice 
under section 138(1) of the Ordinance is mandatory. Section 140 
ibid provides for recovery of the tax due from person holding money 
on behalf of a taxpayer and before invoking its provisions, it would 
be necessary to assume recovery procedure under section 138(1) of 
the Ordinance to enable a taxpayer, particularly a public limited 
company, to manage its financial arrangements while prioritizing 
payments of fiscal dues.  The reason why it has been so held in 
several cases is that there is an obligation on behalf of the State to 
give the taxpayer due notice of its obligation to pay the tax liability 
adjudicated against it and a reasonable opportunity to discharge such 
liability within the timeframe notified to him by the tax authorities1. 
By now it is well settled that no coercive recovery is to be effected 
till tax liability has been adjudicated by at least one appellate forum 
outside the revenue hierarchy2 such as the Appellate Tribunal Inland 
Revenue. If the tax liability, as determined through an amended 
assessment order by the Commissioner is upheld by the 
Commissioner (Appeals) or even by the Appellate Tribunal Inland 
Revenue, the tax due from the taxpayer as determined by assessment 
order might have not changed, but the taxpayer still needs to be 
notified of the timeframe within which the taxpayer is required to

9 
W. P. No.29586 of 2023 
discharge such tax liability, failing which the State could resort to 
the exercise of its coercive power to enforce recovery under section 
138(2) or section 140 of the Ordinance.  If this is not the purpose of 
section 138(1) of the Ordinance, the said provision would be 
redundant and there is a presumption in law against redundancy of 
the legislative expression3.     
10. 
Section 138(1) of the Ordinance serves another essential 
purpose, that is, to inform the taxpayer that the tax liability created 
by the Commissioner has been affirmed by the appellate authority 
and would be recovered by the State unless such assessment is 
interfered with by a higher forum in appeal or tax reference.  The 
notice under section 138(1) requires the tax authorities to prescribe a 
reasonable time period within which the liability is to be discharged.  
If provisions of section 138 of the Ordinance were to be interpreted 
such that a notice under those sections would automatically stand 
resurrected upon decision by the Commissioner (Appeals) upholding 
an assessment order and the due date by which the tax assessed was 
payable could be deemed to be a date that had already passed 
rendering such liability to be overdue and authorizing the tax 
authorities to resort to coercive means under section 140 of the 
Ordinance to recover such liability, the scheme would frustrate the 
right of the taxpayer to avail remedies of appeal before the Tribunal 
or tax reference before the High Court as provided under sections 
130, 131 and 133 of the Ordinance.  Such interpretation would 
restrict right of the taxpayer to access justice and to have its civil 
rights and liabilities adjudicated by an impartial arbiter of the law. 
11.  
Adverting now to the facts of the instant case, respondent 
No.5 had issued a notice under Section 140 of the Ordinance and 
had recovered the tax as determined to be due by the Commissioner 
and Commissioner (Appeals) from the banks within two hours of the 
Commissioner Appeals uploading its order on IRIS.  It is 
                                                 
3 Messrs Pakistan Television Corporation Limited vs. Commissioner Inland Revenue 
(Legal), LTU, Islamabad and others (2017 SCMR 1136). 

10 
W. P. No.29586 of 2023 
implausible that the Deputy Commissioner (respondent No.5) would 
be able to function with such alacrity if he had also become aware of 
the decision of the Commissioner (Appeals) immediately after its 
uploading in IRIS on 03.05.2023 for information of the petitioner.  
The amount of tax liability which was disputed by the petitioner in 
appeal could not be deemed to have become due and recoverable 
under section 138(1) of the Ordinance in the presence of the stay 
order while appeal of the petitioner was still pending, therefore, 
issuance of the recovery notice dated 26.04.2023 at that juncture was 
manifestly without lawful authority and the same was of no legal 
effect.  The decision of respondent No.3 not to issue a notice under 
Section 138(1) of the Ordinance to the petitioner after decision of its 
appeal and seeking attachment of the bank accounts of the petitioner 
and effecting coercive recovery of tax determined in the Assessment 
Order (despite the law laid down by this Court declaring that a 
notice under Section 138(1) of the Ordinance is a mandatory 
requirement of law), appears to be aimed at frustrating the right of 
the petitioner to seek injunctive relief from the Appellate Tribunal. 
The petitioner did seek relief one day thereafter (i.e. 05.05.2023) by 
filing the instant petition before this Court but the amount sought to 
be recovered by the tax department under the Assessment Order had 
already been taken away in exercise of the coercive authority of the 
State under section 140 of the Ordinance. The failure of tax 
authorities to put the petitioner on notice that tax was due and 
payable by the petitioner as determined in the assessment order and 
upheld by Commissioner (Appeals) and prescribing a timeframe for 
discharge of such liability within which the petitioner would be free 
to avail its remedy of appeal before the learned Tribunal, is 
tantamount to playing a fraud on the statute.  
12.  
Revenue functionaries have an obligation to exercise their 
authority under the Ordinance such that it does not undermine the 
rights of taxpayers to due process, fair trial and access to justice. Tax 
authorities are under an obligation to afford the protection of law to 

11 
W. P. No.29586 of 2023 
the citizens rather than becoming instruments of denying taxpayer of 
such protection. 
13 
Upshot of the above discussion is that regardless whether it 
is the Commissioner (Appeals), the Tribunal or the High Court 
upholding an assessment order, the tax authorities are under an 
obligation to issue a notice under Section 138(1) of the Ordinance 
before they resort to use of coercive means under Section 138(2) or 
Section 140 of the Ordinance. It is observed that section 138(1) of 
the Ordinance conceives that a reasonable timeframe is to be 
specified by the Commissioner within which the tax due is to be 
paid.  It is inconceivable that such reasonable time could be a period 
of less than 7 days as the purpose of such provision is to put the 
taxpayer on notice to discharge the tax obligation within a 
reasonable period and also afford the taxpayer an opportunity to 
avail his statutory right of appeal, if so advised. 
14. 
For the foregoing reasons, the instant petition is allowed 
and the impugned notice dated 03.05.2023 issued in purported 
exercise of authority under section 140 of the Ordinance, without 
complying with the mandatory requirement of issuing a notice under 
section 138(1) of the Ordinance, is declared to be without lawful 
authority and of no legal effect. Resultantly, respondents No. 2 to 5 
are directed to ensure that the amount recovered from the bank 
accounts of the petitioner pursuant to the impugned notice under 
Section 140 of the Ordinance is reimbursed to the petitioner or 
credited to the same bank accounts within a period of 30 days, 
unless otherwise the same is liable to be recovered or retained in 
accordance with law. There shall be no order as to costs.
