I shall decide Writ Petition No.65602/2022 and 26090/2023 as a common 
thread weaves through them. 
2. 
 
Respondent Muhammad Anwar lodged FIR No. 839/2022 
dated 10.4.2022 at Police Station Factory Area, District Sheikhupura, 
against Zain Ali and two others for offences under sections 302, 324, 34,  
337-A(i), 337-F(i), and 337-L(2) of the Pakistan Penal Code 1908 (PPC) 
accusing them of murdering Muhammad Ashfaq Ullah and injuring two 
persons, including a passerby. The investigation of that case was assigned 
to Sub-Inspector Shaukat Ali, who concluded it on 17.7.2022. Petitioner 
Zain Ali also recorded his cross-version against Anwar and his 
companions under sections 324, 337-F(ii), and 148, 149 PPC, which 
Shaukat Ali/SI found correct. Anwar applied to the District Police Officer 
for a change of investigation, who sought the opinion of the District 
Standing Board and, on its recommendation, entrusted the investigation of 
the case to Matloob Ahmad, Inspector of District Investigation Branch, 
Sheikhupura, vide order dated 6.10.2022. Zain Ali and co-accused

Husnain challenged this order in Writ Petition No. 65602/2022, 
contending that it was illegal because the challan had been submitted in 
court and copies had been provided to the accused under section 265-C of 
the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 (“Cr.P.C.”). They argued that the 
law did not permit a change in the investigation at such a belated stage, 
and it would result in an endless investigative process. 
3. 
 
On 8.11.2022, when Writ Petition No.65602/2022 came up 
for a preliminary hearing, this Court sought a report and para-wise 
comments from the DPO Sheikhupura but did not suspend the operation 
of the order dated 6.10.2022. Consequently, Matloob Ahmed/Inspector 
finalized his investigation, and a report under section 173 Cr.P.C. was 
submitted to the trial court.  
4. 
 
Meanwhile, on 11.11.2023, Anwar filed a private complaint 
against Zain Ali and others in the Court of the Sessions Judge, 
Sheikhupura, resulting in their summons. The said private complaint is 
still pending, and the proceedings are ongoing.  
5. 
 
Anwar also moved the Regional Police Officer, Sheikhupura, 
for the second change of investigation in terms of Article 18A(2) of the 
Police Order 2002. The RPO referred the matter to the Regional Standing 
Board and, on its recommendations, entrusted the investigation of the case 
to Inspector Tahir Hussain by order dated 30.1.2023. Zain has assailed 
that order in Writ Petition No.26090/2023. 
6. 
 
Mr. Muhammad Ashfaq Mughal, Advocate, contended that 
the DPO, Sheikhupura, lacked jurisdiction to transfer the investigation of 
the case to Inspector Matloob Ahmed because Shaukat Ali/SI, the first 
Investigating Officer, had already completed his investigation by that 
time. He had submitted the challan and the trial court had summoned Zain 
Ali and his co-accused for trial. It had even supplied them copies of 
documents in terms of section 265-C Cr.P.C. Besides, another significant 
development had occurred: Muhammad Anwar had filed a private 
complaint on the same allegations, which was pending. Mr. Mughal 
referred to the Supreme Court’s decision in Nur Elahi v. The State and 
others (PLD 1966 SC 708), stating that if the party lodging the FIR also 
institutes a private complaint on identical allegations against the same set 
of accused, the trial court should prioritize the trial in the complaint case. 

Writ Petition No.65602/2022

Meanwhile, the challan case should be put on hold, awaiting the outcome 
of the trial in the complaint case. Mr. Mughal argued that, on the same 
analogy, re-investigation or further police investigation should not be 
carried out during the pendency of the private complaint. Instead, the 
parties should present evidence before the court and let it decide the 
matter. He suggested that re-investigation might be considered after the 
conclusion of the proceedings in the private complaint, depending on the 
trial’s outcome. Mr. Mughal further contended that permitting re-
investigation would lead to an endless investigative process, so it should 
not be allowed. He concluded that, in the present case, the RPO should 
not have entertained any request for a second change of the investigation 
at the current stage. He maintained that the RPO’s order dated 30.1.2023 
was inappropriate, illegal, and without jurisdiction. 
7. 
 
Mr. Sittar Sahil, Assistant Advocate General, argued that 
Article 18 of the Police Order outlines a comprehensive procedure for 
transferring the investigation of a criminal case. The designated authority 
can exercise power under that provision, following the prescribed 
procedure, even after the submission of the challan, until the court 
concludes the trial. The institution of a private complaint does not impede 
the exercise of this power. The Assistant Advocate General contended 
that the Nur Elahi principle did not apply to the present case, and Mr. 
Mughal’s reference thereto was inappropriate. He further argued that the 
RPO had issued the Impugned Order dated 30.1.2023 after carefully 
considering the facts of the case. It was, therefore, unexceptionable. 
8. 
 
Barrister Hamza Shahid Buttar supported the Assistant 
Advocate General. He added that the above-noted petitions were         
mala fide and an attempt to interfere in the investigative process that lies 
beyond the jurisdiction of the courts. Since Zain had already availed the 
remedy of a private complaint, re-investigation would not prejudice his 
case but instead foster the ends of justice.  
Discussion 
9. 
 
Section 4(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure defines the 
term “investigation”. It includes all the proceedings under the Code that 
are conducted to collect evidence by a police officer or by any person 
authorized by a magistrate (who is not a magistrate himself). The 

Writ Petition No.65602/2022  
 
 
 
 
4 
 
objective is to discover the real facts surrounding the case and ensure that 
the individuals behind the crime are held accountable and brought to 
justice.1 Fair investigation is concomitant to the right to a fair trial 
guaranteed under Article 10A of the Constitution.2 It is also a part of the 
right to life and personal liberty and a minimum requirement of the rule of 
law.3 
10. 
 
Police have a statutory duty to investigate the circumstances 
of the alleged cognizable offences. The case of Emperor v. Khwaja Nazir 
Ahmad (AIR 1945 PC 18) stated that the police do not require any 
judicial authorization for this purpose. The court’s inherent jurisdiction 
cannot undermine this statutory authority. The roles of the judiciary and 
the police are distinct yet complementary, with the balance of individual 
liberty and law enforcement achieved by allowing each institution to fulfil 
its designated functions. However, the court retains the prerogative to 
intervene under section 491 Cr.P.C. to give directions in the nature of 
habeas corpus in appropriate cases. The Privy Council further stated that 
in cognizable offences, the court’s functions begin when a charge is 
preferred before it and not until then. There has been a misconception that 
section 561-A Cr.P.C. confers new powers upon the court. This section 
serves to safeguard the court’s pre-existing inherent powers. Its inclusion 
is intended to dispel any impression that the court’s authority is confined 
solely to those powers expressly conferred by the Criminal Procedure 
Code and to affirm that its inherent authority remains intact even after the 
enactment of that legislation. In Ghulam Muhammad v. Muzammal 
Khan and others (PLD 1967 SC 317), the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
pointed out that the power given by section 561-A Cr.P.C. cannot be 
utilized to interrupt or divert the ordinary course of criminal procedure as 
laid down in the procedural statute. In Shahnaz Begum v. The Hon’ble 
Judges of The High Court of Sind and Baluchistan and another (PLD 
1971 SC 677), the Supreme Court endorsed the dictum laid down in 
Khwaja Nazir Ahmad’s case, adding that the High Court has no power of 
supervision or control over investigation agencies. It further stated that if 
                                          
1 Rule 25.2(3) of the Police Rules, 1934.

an investigation is commenced with mala fide intentions or exceeds the 
jurisdiction of the investigating agencies, a remedy can be sought through 
a proper proceeding under the constitutional jurisdiction of the High 
Court, and if the individual is in detention, under section 491 Cr.P.C. The 
inherent power under section 561-A Cr.P.C. cannot be invoked. This 
notion is echoed in several later cases such as Ghulam Sarwar Zardari v. 
Piyar Ali alias Piyaro and another (2010 SCMR 624), Hayatullah Khan 
and another v. Muhammad Khan and others (2011 SCMR 1354) and 
Muhammad Hanif v. The State (2019 SCMR 2029). 
11. 
 
Investigations can take various forms: (i) initial investigation, 
(ii) further investigation, or (iii) fresh, de novo, or re-investigation.4 The 
investigation conducted by the authorized police officer following the 
registration of an FIR may be termed an “initial investigation”. It may 
lead to filing a final report under section 173(2) Cr.P.C. The role of the 
investigating officer is to gather evidence and ascertain the true facts, 
which must then be presented to the court that decides on the guilt or 
innocence of the accused. The initial investigation also encompasses 
investigations under sections 156(3), 157, and 202 Cr.P.C.  
12. 
 
The necessity for “further investigation” arises when 
additional inquiries or examinations are required to gather more evidence 
or clarify certain aspects of the case. This need is often prompted by new 
information that surfaces during the initial investigation or in response to 
developments within it. Typically resulting in a “supplementary report”, it 
complements the initial investigation without nullifying it. Hence, “further 
investigation” should be distinguished from “re-investigation”, “fresh”, or 
“de novo investigation”. 
13. 
 
Fresh/re-investigation can be ordered when there is a 
complaint alleging that the initial investigation is flawed, unfair, tainted, 
mala fide, or otherwise fails to serve the interests of justice. At times,  
re-investigation may bring on record conflicting evidence and 
contradictory opinions of police officers. In such situations, the court must 
evaluate them following the established principles of criminal 
jurisprudence and rules of evidence to arrive at a correct decision. In 
Muhammad Ashfaq v. Amir Zaman and others (2004 SCMR 1924), the 
                                          
4Vinay Tyagi v. Irshad Ali @ Deepak and others [(2012) 5 SCC 762].  

Writ Petition No.65602/2022

Supreme Court held that the petitioner/complainant’s apprehension that 
his case might be prejudiced by the submission of a report on re-
investigation is unfounded for two reasons: firstly, because the court 
concerned can proceed with the trial on the basis of the report already 
submitted under section 173 Cr.P.C. and, secondly, the court is not bound 
by the opinion given in the said report or expressed in the one submitted 
pursuant to re-investigation. It is always the judicial consideration of the 
material collected by the police that weighs with the court while issuing 
process. 
14. 
 
There is no prohibition on police authorities to conduct 
further investigations or re-investigations in a criminal case after the 
submission of the final report under section 173 Cr.P.C. However, there is 
a conflict in judicial decisions regarding whether they can do so after the 
accused has been indicted. In Altaf Ahmad Makhdoom v. Inspector 
General of Police, Punjab, and others (2023 PCr.LJ 1), after thoroughly 
analyzing the case law on the subject, the High Court held that the 
Supreme Court’s ruling in Muhammad Akbar v. The State and another 
(1972 SCMR 335) was the binding authority. A 4-member Bench handed 
down this decision, while others have come from Benches of lower 
numerical strength of the Supreme Court or the High Courts. In 
Muhammad Akbar, the Supreme Court ruled: 
“… there is nothing in the Code of Criminal Procedure to prevent the 
Investigating Officer from submitting a subsequent report in 
supersession of his earlier one, either on his own initiative or on the 
direction of the superior police officer.” 
15. 
 
In Aswad Iqbal v. RPO etc. (PLD 2020 Lahore 434), this 
Court stated that placing any restriction on investigation after the framing 
of charges would render Article 18A of the Police Order 2002 redundant, 
which delineates a procedure for transferring the investigation of a 
criminal case at any stage.5 This view was reaffirmed in Altaf Ahmad 
Makhdoom’s case, supra. 
                                          
5 Neither the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 nor the Police Rules, 1934, provide any procedure for 
the transfer of investigation of a criminal case from one police officer to the other. This lacuna came to 
be exploited, so when the Police Order 2002 was promulgated to reconstruct and regulate the police, 
specific provisions were made to rectify the situation. Subsequently, the Police Order (Amendment) 
Act, 2013 (XXI of 2013) enacted Article 18A and introduced a new regime for the transfer of 
investigation of criminal cases.

16. 
 
In Abid Hussain v. The State through SHO, Police Station 
Nawab Town, and others (2022 PCr.LJ 83), the High Court emphasized 
that investigating agencies should not be constrained solely by concerns 
about potential trial delays. The pursuit of truth and the delivery of 
substantial justice should outweigh any considerations of trial duration. 
While confirming the permissibility of re-investigation, further 
investigation, or a transfer of investigation at any stage, the High Court 
stated that such an order could be issued only when certain conditions are 
fulfilled, such as the discovery of new events or evidence, or if previous 
investigations were conducted unilaterally without involving the accused, 
or if the previous investigation was conducted mala fide or in excess of 
jurisdiction. 
17. 
 
Here, it is necessary to refer to Bahadur Khan v. 
Muhammad Azam and others (2006 SCMR 373), which added a rider 
that further investigation or re-investigation cannot be done after the trial 
court has decided the case. This view was reaffirmed in Raja Khurshid 
Ahmed v. Muhammad Bilal and others (2014 SCMR 474). 
18. 
 
Mr. Mughal draws on the analogy of the dictum laid down in 
Nur Elahi’s case for his contention that the pendency of a private 
complaint should also limit the power of the police to further or  
re-investigate a case. His reference is inapt and misconceived. In Nur 
Elahi, the central question revolved around the appropriate course of 
action when there is both a challan case and a private complaint regarding 
the same occurrence. The Supreme Court focused on guiding how the 
courts should proceed with the trial in such situations. The police 
investigation was not an issue at all. In other words, the findings in Nur 
Elahi are confined to judicial proceedings and do not address the issue of 
further investigation or re-investigation. Thus, Nur Elahi cannot be 
interpreted to lay down a rule that the investigation process should be held 
in abeyance until the decision of the private complaint. 
19. 
 
The concept of suspending the investigation process and 
linking it with the decision of a private complaint militates against the 
policy and scheme of law. Section 173 Cr.P.C. contemplates expeditious 
completion of investigation and commencement of trial. It mandates that 
as soon as the investigation is completed, the officer in charge of the 

Writ Petition No.65602/2022  
 
 
 
 
8 
 
police station must promptly forward a report in the prescribed form 
through the public prosecutor to the magistrate authorized to take 
cognizance of the offence. If the investigation is not concluded within 14 
days from the date of registration of the First Information Report (FIR), 
the officer in charge of the police station must, within three days after 
that, submit an interim report (through the public prosecutor) to the 
magistrate, in the prescribed form, detailing the results of the investigation 
made until then. The court should then immediately commence the trial 
unless there are valid reasons for a postponement. In Hakim Mumtaz 
Ahmed and another v. The State (PLD 2002 SC 590), the Supreme Court 
held that the provisions of section 173 Cr.P.C. are mandatory and that 
failure to comply with them constitutes a grave violation of law. In Adnan 
Prince v. The State through P.G. Punjab, and another (PLD 2017 SC 
147), the Supreme Court reiterated the fundamental legal principle that 
every accused person has the inherent right to a speedy trial. An undue 
delay in the prosecution process amounts to a denial of justice. 
20. 
 
The law’s intention for the expeditious conclusion of 
investigations is also evident in Article 18A of the Police Order, which 
outlines specific timelines for each tier to decide on applications for the 
transfer of investigations. Additionally, Rule 25.57(1) of the Police Rules 
emphasizes that if, on any day or days, a police officer in charge of 
investigating a case does not conduct any investigation, they must enter a 
statement to this effect in the case diary of that day. Simply put, any gaps 
in this continuous investigative process must be explained and justified. 
The only circumstance allowing the suspension of the investigation is 
outlined in Rule 25.57(2)(i). This Rule states that if the police are 
unsuccessful despite taking all possible measures and it is deemed 
advisable to suspend the investigation, a final report in Form 25.57(2) 
must be submitted as mandated by section 173 Cr.P.C. 
21. 
 
Section 56(e) of the Specific Relief Act 1877 explicitly 
prohibits the issuance of injunctions to stay criminal proceedings. In 
Naseem 
Bibi 
v. 
Sub-Registrar/M.I.C., 
Lahore, 
and 
others  
(2000 YLR 47), it was held that High Courts do not generally issue 
injunctions in writ jurisdiction to halt ongoing criminal investigations. It 
was emphasized that it is the statutory duty of the police to investigate a 

Writ Petition No.65602/2022  
 
 
 
 
9 
 
crime reported to them, and the High Court is typically reluctant to 
interfere with or impede this duty. In Syed Ghulam Abbas Shah v. D G. 
of Police, Rawalpindi Range, and others (2001 YLR 186), it was stated 
that superior courts lack the authority to control investigations directly. 
However, they do possess the power to strike down any order of re-
investigation if it is found to be motivated by malice or ulterior motives. It 
was further stated that superior courts could not outrightly stop an 
investigation or invalidate a re-investigation order merely because a 
police officer had previously concluded the investigation. Suspending an 
investigation for an indefinite period, or even unnecessary delay, can lead 
to the loss or destruction of evidence, undermining both fair investigation 
and fair trial processes. In Azra Israr v. Inspector General of Police, 
Punjab, and others (PLD 2003 Lahore 1), it was held that in situations 
where the same matter is pending before a civil court and a criminal court, 
sometimes in an appropriate case, proceedings before the criminal court 
are stayed while awaiting a decision from the civil court. Nevertheless, 
the law does not require the stoppage of the investigation of a criminal 
case on such grounds. Instead, it underscores the necessity for 
uninterrupted police investigations of criminal offences and emphasizes 
their prompt conclusion. This approach is rooted in public policy 
considerations because halting an investigation could lead to severe 
complications: witnesses may pass away or become unavailable, 
memories may fade, crucial documents may disappear or be lost, or the 
relevant evidence may be tampered with or suborned. The Supreme Court 
expressed a similar view in Adnan Prince v. The State through P.G., 
Punjab, and another (PLD 2017 SC 147). 
22. 
 
To sum up, the law allows for further investigation, re-
investigation, or the transfer of an ongoing investigation even after the 
submission of a challan or framing of charges until the trial is concluded. 
However, these actions cannot be done arbitrarily; specific conditions 
must be satisfied, and the competent authority must provide compelling 
justifications for their decisions. Despite the potential for trial delays, such 
actions are warranted if they serve the cause of justice. 
23. 
 
Further investigation or re-investigation can be ordered even 
when a private complaint is pending if the circumstances warrant it. The 

Writ Petition No.65602/2022  
 
 
 
 
10 
 
court may hold the challan case in abeyance and proceed with the private 
complaint following the law enunciated by the Supreme Court in Nur 
Elahi, but it cannot halt further investigation or re-investigation unless 
exceptional circumstances exist. Section 56(e) of the Specific Relief Act 
prohibits injunctions against criminal investigations, and it is also the 
policy of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Police Order, and the Police 
Rules 1934 that the investigation should continue and be completed 
expeditiously. Importantly, Nur Elahi does not address the question of 
further investigation or re-investigation. 
The case at hand 
24. 
 
I have examined the Impugned Order dated 30.1.2023 passed 
by the RPO Sheikhupura in light of the principles discussed above. The 
objection that it would prejudice the Petitioners is repelled. The mere fact 
that Respondent Anwar has filed a private complaint or that the trial court 
has held in abeyance the proceedings in the challan case is no ground to 
strike down that order. 
25. 
 
Respondent Anwar applied to the RPO Sheikhupura for 
transfer of investigation of case FIR No.839/2022 under Article 18A(2) of 
the Police Order. He referred to the Regional Standing Board for an 
opinion and, on its recommendation, accepted Anwar’s request by order 
dated 30.1.2023. The RPO has given detailed reasons supporting the order 
as required by law. Mr. Mughal has failed to persuade this Court that it 
suffers from any perversity. I may also highlight that it is a settled 
principle of law that the High Court does not sit as a court of appeal when 
exercising constitutional jurisdiction. 
26. 
 
These petitions have no merit and are dismissed.
