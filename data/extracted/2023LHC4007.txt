Mirza Viqas Rauf, J. The petitioners herein are owners of flour mills 
operating in various parts of District Attock. They are seeking writ of 
mandamus for enhancement of wheat quota. The grievance of the petitioners 
is that the respondents are though bound to release the wheat for each 
district on the basis of need of the targeted population of that district but 
instead they have decreased the supply of wheat quota to the flour mills of 
District Attock without any lawful excuse. 
2.  
In response to this petition, respondents No.1 and 2, being the 
most concerned to the subject, submitted their report and parawise 
comments. It is stated therein that Punjab Food Department Procures wheat 
every year from growers at support price fixed by the Government to 
maintain food security reserves, to cater the requirements of targeted 
population and to stabilize the price of flour and wheat in the open market 
with the intervention of the Wheat Release/Milling Policy. To this effect a 
Date of hearing: 
31.05.2023.

policy was notified on 19th May, 2022 as Wheat Release/Milling Policy, 
2022-23 in terms whereof wheat was to be released for each district on the 
basis of need of the targeted population of the particular district. It is stance 
of the respondents that subsidized wheat quota is only issued to cater for the 
need/requirement of the targeted population/urban population of the 
concerned district and the flour mills cannot claim the enhancement of wheat 
quota as a matter of right. 
3.  
Learned counsel for the petitioners contended that in the previous 
years, a reasonable wheat quota was fixed for the District Attock but in the 
current year, quota has been decreased considerably without assigning any 
lawful reasoning. Learned counsel contended with vehemence that it is the 
bounden duty of the State to provide basic necessities of life to its citizens, 
which includes wheat as well. It is argued that the respondents have failed to 
adhere the mandate of Article 38 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic 
of Pakistan, 1973. Learned counsel submitted that despite clear 
recommendations from the District Administration, no concrete steps have 
been taken by the respondents to ensure the release of required wheat in 
District Attock. Reliance is placed on IBRAHIM FLOUR AND GENERAL 
MILLS, 
DISTRICT 
SHEIKHUPURA 
through 
Chief 
Executive 
v. 
GOVERNMENT OF PUNJAB through Secretary to the Government of the 
Punjab, Food Department, Lahore and another (PLD 2008 Lahore 184). 
4.  
Conversely, learned Law Officer submitted that the petitioners 
being the mill owners have no vested right to claim the enhancement of 
wheat quota. He added that supply of wheat is within the domain of the 
respondents and they are regulating the activity under a policy framed for 
the said purpose. Learned Law Officer contended that wheat quota cannot be 
fixed at the whims of the petitioners and this petition is not tenable under the 
law.

6.  
The petitioners are admittedly the mill owners operating within 
District Attock. The grievance of the petitioners is restricted to the allocation 
of wheat quota. In order to control the supply, distribution and movement of, 
and trade and commerce in, foodstuffs in the Punjab, the Punjab Foodstuffs 
(Control) (Act XX of 1958) (hereinafter referred to as “Act, 1958”) was 
promulgated. Sub-article 2(a) provides the definition of foodstuff, which 
reads as under: - 
2(a) 
“foodstuff” means any of the following classes of 
commodities:-- 
(i) 
Wheat, wheat atta, maida, rawa and suji; 
(ii) 
Rice and paddy; 
(iii) 
Sugar; and 
(iv) 
Such other commodity or class of commodities as may be 
declared and notified by the Government to be foodstuffs 
for the purposes of this Act; 
Wheat is clearly a foodstuff in terms of the above definition.  
7.  
Section 3 of the "Act, 1958" bestows power upon the Government 
to ensure supply and equal distribution of foodstuffs within the province and 
also to take all necessary measures for the said purpose. In furtherance 
thereof, the Government of Punjab promulgated Wheat Release/Milling 
Policy, 2022-23. In terms of clause V of the policy, wheat shall be released 
for each district on the basis of need of the targeted population of that 
district. District Attock is amongst the said districts whose daily authorized 
quota was allocated as 488 metric tons. As per clause VIII of the Policy, 
flour mills getting wheat from Punjab Food Department shall also be 
entitled to grind their private wheat stocks. Flour mills getting wheat from 
Punjab Food Department shall be bound to deliver minimum 25% flour 
obtained from their private wheat stocks in their respective Districts. 
8.  
It is thus evident that process of grinding of flour mills is not 
restricted to the wheat collected through fixed quota from the Government 
but mills can grind their private wheat stocks as well. Though much 
emphasis was laid by learned counsel for the petitioners while making 

 
4 
 
 
W.P.No.940 of 2023 
 
 
 
reference to certain recommendations of the District Administration that 
wheat quota of District Attock has been gradually decreased but in order to 
properly appreciate this aspect of the matter, a report was also requisitioned 
from the respondents wherein it is narrated that earlier the Punjab Food 
Department has surplus wheat stocks procured through wheat procurement 
policies. The specific quantity of subsidized wheat quota was allocated to 
each district, however, the flour mills were allowed to uplift subsidized 
wheat from the surplus districts during Wheat Procurement Policies 2015 to 
2019 but thereafter the subsidized wheat quota was allowed to be issued to 
the respective flour mills of the district on the basis of targeted/ urban 
population of the concerned district which brought the figure of wheat quota 
down-hill. In order to justify the apparent decrease in the wheat quota, it is 
stated by the respondents that population of District Attock is 1883554 and 
after inclusion of 2.34% growth rate for two years, total figures of 
population are reported as 2112836. It is stated that as per Crop Reporting 
Service (Agriculture Department), the production of wheat is 310340 metric 
tons from an area of 452000 acres. As per calculation of the Ministry of 
National Food Security & Research, per capita per annum requirement is 
115 kg. During current year against the requirement of 178 metric tons, 
following cascading based increase as per requirement was made in quota 
for release of wheat to mills: - 
  
 
i) 
19.05.2022  
488 M. Tons 
  
 
ii) 
23.09.2022  
537 M. Tons 
  
 
iii) 
21.12.2022  
585 M. Tons 
  
 
iv) 
09.01.2023  
674 M. Tons 
It is stance of the respondents that in order to cater the requirement of flour 
of urban population (490006 individuals) in District Attock, per day quota 
calculates to 178 metric tons and as per requirement of flour and availability 
of wheat in open market, the quota was gradually increased to cater the 
requirement of general public. It is explained by the respondents that 
multiple factors lead towards calculation of quota for district Attock i.e. 

 
5 
 
 
W.P.No.940 of 2023 
 
 
 
urban & rural population, wheat production in the area, availability of 
stocks with the flour mills, refugees residing in district and military 
cantonments etc. It is pointed out that as per policy, the flour mills will 
supply 25% share out of per day grinding in the market as well and quota of 
every district is decreased as maximum population has benefited from the 
Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) (Free Flour) and arrival of the 
new crop in open market as well. The explanation with regard to apparent 
decline in the figure of wheat quota of District Attock is quite logical.  
9.  
So far judgment in the case of IBRAHIM FLOUR AND GENERAL 
MILLS, DISTRICT SHEIKHUPURA through Chief Executive supra is 
concerned, it is noticed that in the said case, the petitioners therein were 
treated discriminatory by the Food Department in the matter of allocation of 
quota of wheat according to their entitlement. In that backdrop, their 
petitions were accepted in the light of Article 25 of the Constitution of the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as 
"Constitution"). Facts in the said case are thus rested on entirely different 
footings. The principles laid down in the said judgment are hardly attracted 
to the present case. 
10.  
As already observed that in terms of section 3 of the "Act 1958", 
the Government is vested with the power to control the supply of foodstuffs 
for ensuring equal distribution as well as price hike. Fixation of quota is 
clearly a function of executive falling within its policy making domain. 
Wheat Release/Milling Policy 2022-23 clearly has a lawful backing under 
section 3 of the "Act, 1958". This Court in exercise of constitutional 
jurisdiction cannot abridge the powers of executive to frame a policy or to 
settle its terms as per wishes and whims of a particular individual or a group 
of society. While analyzing the vires of a policy, the Court is obliged to keep 
in mind the concept of trichotomy of powers between legislature, executive 
and judiciary. This well-known principle is inbuilt in the “Constitution” 
which is founded on the ground that the legislature being representative of 
the people enacts the law and the law so enacted acquires legitimacy. 

 
6 
 
 
W.P.No.940 of 2023 
 
 
 
Framing of a policy with regard to a particular subject is within the 
exclusive domain of the executive, which is in a better position to decide on 
account of its mandate, experience, wisdom and sagacity which are acquired 
through diverse skills. The last pillar of the trichotomy of powers is the 
judiciary, who is entrusted with the task to interpret the law and to play the 
role of an arbiter in cases of disputes between the individuals inter se and 
between individual and the State. Guidance in this respect can be sought 
from DOSSANI TRAVELS PVT.  LTD and others v. Messrs TRAVELS SHOP 
(PVT) LTD. and others (PLD 2014 Supreme Court 1). The relevant extract 
from the same is reproduced below: - 
“26. One of the seminal principles of the Constitution of 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan is the concept of trichotomy of 
powers between the Legislature, Executive and the Judiciary. This 
principle underpins the rationale that framing of a government 
policy is to be undertaken by the Executive which is in a better 
position to decide on account of its mandate, experience, wisdom 
and sagacity which are acquired through diverse skills. The 
Legislature which represents the people enacts the law and the law 
so enacted acquires legitimacy. The judiciary on the other hand, is 
entrusted with the task of interpreting the law and to play the role 
of an arbiter in cases of disputes between the individuals inter se 
and between individual and the State. We may remind ourselves 
that judiciary neither has sword nor purse. The legitimacy and 
respect of its judgments is dependent on peoples' confidence in its 
strict adherence to the Constitution, its integrity, impartiality and 
independence. In changing times and judicialization of political 
issues, a certain degree of judicial activism by fearless and 
impartial judiciary is also essential for maintaining its integrity 
and peoples' trust. In most of the modern democracies, judiciaries 
have been called upon to provide wider meanings to various 
provisions of the Constitution so as to meet the challenges of 
modern times and to fill the gap between the law and the 
requirements of substantive justice. Every institution has to play its 
role in enforcing the Constitution and the law. It is a multi-
disciplinary exercise. However, implementation of rule of law is 
the primary function of judiciary. This role is multi-dimensional 
and the most challenging facet of this role is to keep various 
institutions and the judiciary itself within the limits of their 
respective powers laid down in the Constitution and the law. The 
legitimacy of its judgments does not arise from the beauty of the 
language or the use of populist rhetoric. Rather it radiates from 
the dynamism reflected in interpreting the Constitution and in 
particular its Fundamental Rights provisions, in judicial restraint 
displayed in deference to the principle of trichotomy of powers, 
and in an impersonal and impartial application of law.”

W.P.No.940 of 2023 
 
 
 
11.  
Right of freedom of trade, business or profession is not an 
absolute and unbridled right, rather it is regulated by some restrictions. 
Article 18 of the "Constitution" is very clear and unequivocal in its terms, 
which reads as under: - 
18.  
Freedom of trade, business or profession. Subject to such 
qualifications, if any, as may be prescribed by law, every citizen 
shall have the right to enter upon any lawful profession or 
occupation, and to conduct any lawful trade or business:  
Provided that nothing in this Article shall prevent—  
(a) the regulation of any trade or profession by a licensing 
system; or  
(b) the regulation of trade, commerce or industry in the 
interest of free competition therein; or  
(c) the carrying on, by the Federal Government or a 
Provincial Government, or by a corporation controlled by 
any such Government, of any trade, business, industry or 
service, to the exclusion, complete or partial, of other 
persons.  
From the bare perusal of Article 18 of the “Constitution”, there remains no 
cavil that right of freedom, trade, business or profession is always subject to 
such qualifications, if any, as may be prescribed by law. These qualifications 
empower the Government to frame a policy, which is even provided under 
section 3 of the "Act, 1958". It is an oft repeated principle of law that in 
absence of any illegality, perversity, arbitrariness or an established 
malafide, it will not be open for the High Court to annul a policy framed by 
the executive. 
12.  
Article 38 of the "Constitution" guarantees the promotion of 
social and economic well-being of the people. Sub-article (d) though ordains 
that the State shall provide basic necessities of life e.g. food, clothing, 
housing, education and medical relief, for all such citizens, irrespective of 
sex, caste, creed or race, as are permanently or temporarily unable to earn 
their livelihood on account of infirmity, sickness or unemployment but its

mandate cannot be extended for the benefit of petitioners being mill owners 
only to promote their business. 
13.  
For the foregoing reasons, this petition being devoid of any merits 
fails and dismissed with no order as to costs.
