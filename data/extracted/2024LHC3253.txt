Through this petition under Article 199 of 
the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973 (the “Constitution”), the Petitioner/Pak Gulf 
Construction (Private) Limited has called in 
question the vires of impugned order dated 
14.12.2023, whereby the Respondent No.4 has 
proceeded to compulsory register it in terms of 
Section 27 of the Punjab Sales Tax on Services 
Act, 2012 (the “Act”).  
2. 
Brief facts of this case are that the Petitioner 
is the private limited company managing, 
developing and constructing the project known as 
“Centaurus” situated in Islamabad, comprising of 
shopping mall, residential apartments and hotel. 

2 
W.P.No.169/2024 
The Petitioner is duly registered for the purpose of 
sales tax with the Federal Board of Revenue (the 
“FBR”) since its physically located in Islamabad 
and fall under the territorial jurisdiction of the FBR 
and is discharging its due sales tax liability on 
CAM charges and branding income as per 
provisions of the Islamabad Capital Territory (Tax 
on Services) Ordinance (the “Ordinance”).  
3. 
Hafiz Muhammad Idrees, ASC, at the 
outset, submitted that the Petitioner is not liable to 
be registered under Section 25 of the Act because 
under this provision of law a person providing   
any taxable service from his place of business in 
the Punjab, is required registration whereas the 
Petitioner is doing its entire business in the capital 
territory, Islamabad, and is already registered with 
the FBR. He maintained that the Respondents 
PRA have no lawful authority to compulsory 
register the Petitioner under the Act because the 
Punjab Revenue Authority (the “PRA”) is being 
controlled by the Government of the Punjab. He 
next argued that even otherwise Respondent No.4 
has not authority to issue the impugned order, 
therefore, the same is liable to be set-aside. 
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the PRA 
submitted that though registration is compulsory 
as per Section 25 under Chapter IV of the Act but 
Section 29(1) of the Act also provides the 
provisions about de-registration by clarifying that 
the Commissioner may de-register a registered 
person or such class of registered person not 
required to be registered under this Act and the 

3 
W.P.No.169/2024 
Petitioner may seek this remedy before the 
competent authority by making an application.  
5. 
In response, Hafiz Muhammad Idrees, ASC 
contended that the Petitioner has already filed an 
application in terms of Section 29(2) of the Act but 
the same has not been decided thus far, hence, this 
petition. However, he next argued that the 
Petitioner would be satisfied if the matter be 
referred to the concerned authority for its 
expeditious disposal in light of aforesaid 
provisions of law. 
6. 
Arguments heard and record perused. 
7. 
The crux of the issue in this case is the 
registration or de-registration of the Petitioner and 
stance of Hafiz Muhammad Idrees, ASC is that the 
Petitioner is not liable to be registered with the 
PRA because it provides taxable service outside 
the province of Punjab. Before making any 
discussion on this point, firstly a quick glance is 
taken at preamble of the Act, which is reproduced 
hereunder for ease of the matter: 
“Whereas it is expedient to provide for the 
levy of a tax on services provided, rendered, 
initiated, originated, executed, received or 
consumed in the Punjab and to deal with 
ancillary matters.” 
 
The relevant provisions, which describe the 
procedure about registration and de-registration 
are Sections 25 and 29 of the Act, are also given 
below for ready reference: 
“25. Registration.– (1) A person shall 
register under this Act, who– 

4 
W.P.No.169/2024 
(a) 
provides any taxable service 
 
from his office or place of 
 
business in the Punjab; or 
(b) 
is otherwise required to be 
 
registered under any of the 
 
provisions of the Act or the 
 
rules; or 
(c) 
fulfills any other criteria or 
 
requirements 
which 
the 
 
Authority may prescribe under 
 
sub-section (2). 
(2) 
The registration under this section 
will be regulated in such manner and 
subject to such conditions and restrictions 
as the Authority may, by notification in the 
official Gazette, prescribe. 
3) 
A person who receives a service, which 
is a taxable service by virtue of sub-section 
(2) of section 3, and is not a registered person 
shall be deemed to be a registered person for 
the purposes of the tax period in which– 
(a) 
such 
person 
receives 
the 
 
service; 
(b) 
an invoice for the value of the 
 
service is issued or sent to or 
 
received by the person; or 
(c) 
consideration for the service 
 
is paid by the person – 
 
whichever is earlier and all 
 
the provisions of this Act and 
 
the rules shall be applicable 
 
to 
such 
person 
for 
that 
 
particular tax period and any 
 
matters relating to, arising out 
 
of, or concerning that tax 
 
period as if that person had 
 
provided the service. 
(4) 
The Authority may publish on its 
website a list of persons registered under 
this Act. 
(5) 
It shall be reasonable for a person to 
believe that another person is registered 
under this Act if that other person is on the 
list placed on the website of the Authority.” 
 
“29. De-registration.– 
(1) 
The 
Commissioner may de-register a registered 

5 
W.P.No.169/2024 
person or such class of registered persons 
not required to be registered under this Act. 
(2) 
Where any person registered under 
this Act believes that he does not satisfy the 
requirements for registration specified in 
section 25, he may make an application to 
the Commissioner to be de-registered. 
(3) 
If upon receiving such an application, 
the Commissioner is satisfied that the 
person is not required to be registered 
under this Act and has fulfilled the 
obligations under the Act, it shall de-
register such person. 
(4) 
Where the Commissioner receives an 
application under sub-section (2), it shall 
dispose of the application within a period of 
three months from the date of the receipt of 
the application, or within such extended 
period, not exceeding sixty days, as the 
Commissioner may, for reasons to be 
recorded in writing, fix.” 
 
If preamble of the Act is read with the provisions 
of Section 25(1)(a) of the Act, it will clarify that 
the Act has been introduced by the legislature for 
levy of tax, in expedient manners, on the services 
(i) provided, (ii) rendered, (iii) initiated, (iv) 
originated, (v) executed, (vi) received or (vii) 
consumed in the Punjab and a person is required 
to be registered under this Act if he or she provides 
any taxable service from his or her office or place 
of business in the Punjab. The main stress of 
learned counsel for the Petitioner is that his client 
is not rendering services in the province of Punjab 
rather its entire business is in Islamabad territory, 
thus, it cannot be forced to be registered with the 
PRA. Under Article 1 Pakistan consists of four 
Provinces and one capital territory i.e. Islamabad 
Capital Territory. The PRA is controlled by the 

6 
W.P.No.169/2024 
province is Punjab while capital territory comes 
within the administrative mechanism of the 
Federal Government, therefore, the stance taken 
by learned counsel for the Petitioner has some 
force. 
8. 
Be that as it may, since under Section 29(2)  
if a person does not satisfy with the requirements 
for registration specified in section 25 of the Act, 
he may make an application to the Commissioner 
in this regard, a copy of this writ petition is 
transmitted to Respondent No.3 who will consider 
it as a representation of the Petitioner and decide 
the same after hearing all concerned, including the 
Petitioner, and examining the entire record, strictly 
as per relevant provisions of the Act [specifically 
Section 29(2)], through a speaking order, within 
four weeks from the receipt of certified copy of 
this order. In the meanwhile, under the Doctrine of 
Stopgap Arrangement developed by this Court in 
the judgments reported as Shell Pakistan Limited 
versus Government of Punjab etc. (2020 PTD 
1607) and Shaheen Merchant versus Federation of 
Pakistan/National Tariff Commission and others 
(2021 PTD 2126), the Respondents are restrained 
from taking any coercive measures against the 
Petitioner, till decision of its representation.
