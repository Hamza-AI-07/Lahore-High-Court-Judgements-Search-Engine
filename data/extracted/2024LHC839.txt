Through this petition under Article 199 of 
the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973 (the “Constitution”), the Petitioner has 
challenged the vires of impugned notification 
dated 07.03.2020 issued by Respondent No.2. 
2. 
 Raja Habib-ur-Rehman, Advocate has 
reiterated the submissions already made in this 
petition. However, his main stress is that the 
Deputy Commissioner, Rawalpindi has no power 
to issue the impugned notification under the 
Guzara Land Rules. He strenuously submitted 
that under Rule 5 of the Guzara Land Rules, any 
resident of the area, which falls within the limits 
of Guzara Forest, may uproot or cut down the 
trees without getting any permission or license 
from the concerned authority, therefore, the 
Petitioner cannot be stopped from cutting down 

2 
W.P.No.862/2020 
trees on his privately owned land under the garb 
of impugned notification.  
3. 
Learned Law Officer has objected to the 
maintainability of this petition by submitting that 
the impugned notification has rightly been issued 
by the concerned authority strictly as per the 
relevant laws and the jurisprudence developed by 
the superior Courts of the country from time to 
time. 
4. 
Pursuant to the direction issued by this 
Court on 27.03.2020, the answering Respondents 
No.2 and 3 have submitted their report & para-
wise comments by defending the impugned 
notification under relevant provisions of the 
applicable law.  
5. 
On the last date of hearing i.e. 06.10.2022, 
this Court appointed Ch. Imran Hassan Ali, ASC 
as Amicus Curiae, who submits that he has made 
a deep research work on the point involved by 
going through the relevant law as well as the 
jurisprudence developed by the superior Courts of 
the Country. He explained that the Petitioner has 
no real grievance to bring this petition; that       
the Petitioner does not specifically disclose how 
he is personally aggrieved of the impugned 
notification. He argued that prima facie, from the 
comments filed by answering Respondents, no 
interference has been made in the use of private 
land, which is in possession of the Petitioner.    
He contended that the Petitioner has not 
challenged the existing rules, which are already 
applicable to his Tehsil. He also pointed out that 

3 
W.P.No.862/2020 
impugned notification simply extends the earlier 
notifications issued by the concerned authority 
with regard to other Tehsils of Rawalpindi but 
surprisingly, the Petitioner has not challenged the 
said (earlier) notifications. He pleaded that since 
the trees play vital role in our climate, therefore, 
felling and cutting of trees will badly affect the 
climate regulation. He next argued that though 
the Petitioner has a weak case because the 
impugned notification puts general restrictions 
about falling and cutting of trees to all types of 
lands but the contention of his learned counsel, 
on which he is pressing hard, that the Deputy 
Commissioner, Rawalpindi lacks jurisdiction to 
issue the impugned notification, has some force 
because it is the Government, which can only 
impose such kind of restrictions, therefore, at the 
most, the matter may be referred to the concerned 
authority, i.e. the Secretary, Forestry, Wildlife 
and Fisheries Department, Government of the 
Punjab, for its expeditious disposal in accordance 
with law as well as the verdicts given by the 
superior Courts of the country on the issue in 
hand from time to time. He has referred to some 
decisions cited as D.G. Khan Cement Company 
Ltd. versus Government of Punjab through Chief 
Secretary, Lahore and others (2021 SCMR 834), 
Sheikh Asim Farooq versus Federation of 
Pakistan and others (PLD 2019 Lahore 664), 
Asif Saleem versus Chairman BOG University of 
Lahore and others (PLD 2019 Lahore 407) and 
Maple 
Leaf 
Cement 
Factory 
Ltd. 
versus 

4 
W.P.No.862/2020 
Environmental Protection Agency and others 
(PLD 2018 Lahore 255).  
6. 
Arguments heard and record perused. 
7. 
Before dealing with the issue in hand, it 
would be fair to note down the importance of the 
trees. No life could exist on earth without the 
trees because these are the natural source of air 
conditioning/air filtering. By absorbing odors and 
pollutant gases, like nitrogen oxides, ammonia, 
sulfur dioxide and ozone, and filtering particles 
out of the air, the trees clean the air. In addition, 
there would be no rain without the trees as they 
absorb water from the soil and release it into the 
air through an evaporative process, providing the 
moisture for rain to form. In short, the trees play 
important role in regulating the environment and 
climate change, therefore, instead of uprooting or 
cutting trees, there is dire need of plantation of 
trees in order to protect the environment/climate 
regulation. However, trees, which may adversely 
affect the human health or the climate change as 
per the current climate change research, can be 
uprooted or cut down, subject to the prevailing 
laws/policies. 
8. 
Now coming to the merits of the case, it is 
observed that the Petitioner has not a strong case 
in his favour because he has not specifically 
disclosed how he is personally aggrieved of the 
impugned notification. The prayer clause of the 
comments filed by the (answering) Respondents 
clearly depicts that no hindrance has been created 
in the use of private land, which is owned by the 

5 
W.P.No.862/2020 
Petitioner. Rules 5 and 6(2) of notification 
No.618 dated 15.01.1912 (available at page 7 of 
the report/comments) apply to the agricultural 
land in Tehsil Kahuta where the Petitioner claims 
to own land, already permit the residents in an 
estate to uproot and/or remove trees of class-B for 
agricultural or domestic purposes. The impugned 
notification does not change this situation and 
merely, extends the said rules to other Tehsils of 
Rawalpindi. Similarly, Rules 3 and 5 of 
notification No.343 dated 12.06.1909 (available 
at page 19 of the report/comments) as amended 
from time to time, only apply to waste and 
uncultivated areas of Tehsil Kahuta, entitling the 
village residents to wood for catering their 
agricultural as well as domestic needs whereas 
the impugned notification does not change this 
situation as well and merely, extends the said 
rules to other Tehsils of Rawalpindi. Moreover, a 
joint reading of Rules 5 and Rule 6(2) of 
aforesaid notification (No.343 dated 12.06.1909) 
also makes it clear that the directions contained 
therein relate to wood of spontaneous growth and 
does not apply to cultivated trees on one’s own 
land. Most importantly, the Rules for the 
Conservancy of Forests and Jungles in the Hill 
Districts of the Punjab Territories, 1855 (the 
“1855 Rules”) already apply to all “hill districts”. 
Similarly, as noted above, notification No.618 
dated 15.01.1912, notification No.619 dated 
15.11.1912 
and 
notification 
No.343 
dated 
12.06.1909 already apply to Tehsil Kahuta where 

6 
W.P.No.862/2020 
the Petitioner claims to own land and the 
impugned notification simply extends these 
notifications to other Tehsils of Rawalpindi but 
astonishingly, the Petitioner has not challenged 
these (earlier) notifications. 
9. 
Suffice to mention here that the impugned 
notification relates to the protection of Guzara 
Forest and since cutting of trees may adversely 
affect the climate change as discussed above, the 
same has been issued as per the laws made by the 
legislature from time to time for controlling the 
climate change and melting of glacier on the 
touchstone of the principles already settled by 
this Court in the cases of Asghar Leghari versus 
Federation of Pakistan and others (PLD 2018 
Lahore 364), Asim Farooq Case (supra) (PLD 
2019 Lahore 664) and the recent judgment 
passed in the case of Pervaiz Abbasi versus 
Government of Punjab and others (2022 LHC 
6911) (LHC Citation) in which the issue of hill 
razing as well as cutting trees has been 
highlighted and the aspect of promulgating proper 
legislation in this regard has been discussed. The 
issue of climate change and conservation of 
forests has also been dealt with by the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in the case of Shah Zaman 
Khan and others versus Government of Khyber 
Pakhtunkhwa 
through 
Chief 
Secretary, 
Peshawar and others (PLD 2023 SC 340) by 
holding (in paragraph-22) as under: 
 
“22.  Climate change is not just a future 
threat but a present reality. The planet is 

7 
W.P.No.862/2020 
in crisis and disasters are accelerating 
disasters. Climatic events of unprecedented 
severity are being witnessed. The unilateral 
and unsustainable pillage of the earth's 
resources has left humanity, and all other 
species, vulnerable. Excessive burning of 
fossil fuels has heated up the earth's 
temperature and when forests, which 
sequester carbon emissions are stripped 
away, its effect is compounded. Carbon 
fuel extraction needs to correlate with the 
available trees, plants and phytoplankton 
which store emissions. The causes of 
climate change and the catastrophic 
events that it unleashes are (by now) 
empirically established, yet the problem 
is not being addressed with the requisite 
urgency and seriousness. Simple mitigation 
measures are also not implemented. 
Carbon emissions, and not trees, have to 
be cut down. The learned Judges failed to 
consider that the Forest Ordinance was a 
beneficial piece of legislation which was 
enacted to conserve scarce remaining 
forests.” 
 
In D.G. Khan Cement Case (supra) (2021 
SCMR 834), the Supreme Court of Pakistan has 
also highlighted the significance of environment 
and ecosystem of the Country by holding (in 
paragraph-19) of said judgment as under: 
 
“19. Another important dimension of 
climate change is intergenerational justice 
and the need for climate democracy. The 
tragedy is that tomorrow's generations 
aren't here to challenge this pillaging of 
their inheritance. The great silent majority 
of future generations is rendered powerless 
and needs a voice. This Court should be 
mindful that its decisions also adjudicate 
upon the rights of the future generations of 
this country. It is important to question 
ourselves; how will the future generations 
look back on us and what legacy we leave 
for them?41 This Court and the Courts 

8 
W.P.No.862/2020 
around the globe have a role to play in 
reducing the effects of climate change for 
our generation and for the generations to 
come. Through our pen and jurisprudential 
fiat, we need to decolonize our future 
generations from the wrath of climate 
change, by upholding climate justice at all 
times. Democracy, anywhere in the world 
is pillared on the rule of law, which 
substantially means rights based rule of 
law rather than rule based; which 
guarantees fundamental values of morality, 
justice, and human rights, with a proper 
balance between these and other needs of 
the 
society.42 
Post 
climate 
change, 
democracies have to be redesigned and 
restructured to become more climate 
resilient and the fundamental principle of 
rule of law has to recognize the urgent 
need to combat climate change. Robust 
democracies 
need 
to 
be 
climate 
democracies in order to save the world and 
our 
further 
generations 
from 
being 
colonized at the hands of climate change. 
The premabular constitutional value of 
democracy under our Constitution is in 
effect climate democracy, if we wish to 
actualize 
our 
Constitution 
and 
the 
fundamental rights guaranteed under the 
Constitution for ourselves and our future 
generations. Janine Benyus43 suggests we 
learn from nature's 3.8 billion years of 
evolution. How is it that other species have 
learned to survive and thrive for 10,000 
generations or more? Well, it's by taking 
care of the place that would take care of 
their offspring, by living within the 
ecosystem in which they are embedded, by 
knowing not to foul the nest. We must 
restore and repair and care for the 
planetary home that will take care of our 
offspring. For our children, and our 
children's children, and all those yet to 
come, we must love our rivers and 
mountains and reconnect with the long and 
life-giving cycles of nature. To us there is 
no 
conflict 
between 
environmental  
 

9 
W.P.No.862/2020 
protection and development because our 
answer would be sustainable development. 
Sustainable 
development 
means 
development that meets the needs of the 
present generation without compromising 
the ability of future generations to meet 
their needs and it is in step with our 
constitutional 
values 
of 
social 
and 
economic justice.” 
 
10. 
Now, the only point to be determined by 
this Court is whether the Deputy Commissioner 
is empowered, under the law, to issue the 
impugned notification. This power can only be 
exercised by the Government and the Deputy 
Commissioner does not come within definition 
of the Government. Rules 4 and 7 of the 1855 
Rules empower the Civil Authorities to impose 
certain prohibitions or restrictions on felling of 
trees on any land in a hill district. It is also 
important to mention that the 1855 Rules are 
saved by Section 3 read with Schedule I of the 
Punjab Laws Act, 1872 (the “1872 Act”). The 
term “Civil Authorities” could possibly mean the 
Deputy Commissioner of a district. However, 
Rule 76 of the Forest Act, 1927 [amended 2016] 
(the “1927 Act”), empowers the Government to 
make rules. Under Section 2(j) of the 1927 Act, 
Government means the Government of the 
Punjab. As per Second Schedule to the Punjab 
Government Rules of Business, 2011 (the “2011 
Rules”), the Forestry, Wildlife and Fisheries 
Department is entrusted with the powers to 
administer the 1927 Act and the rules made 
thereunder whereas Rule 20 of the 2011 Rules 

10 
W.P.No.862/2020 
provides that the Law and Parliamentary Affairs 
Department 
shall 
be 
consulted 
by 
other 
departments on matters concerning delegated 
legislation, such as, rules and regulations etc. 
Furthermore, under Rule 3(3) of the 2011 Rules, 
the business of the Government is distributed 
amongst several Departments in the manner 
indicated in the Second Schedule and Secretary, 
Forestry, Wildlife and Fisheries Department, 
Punjab can take cognizance of the matter in terms 
of Rule 10 of the 2011 Rules, which clearly states 
that the Secretary shall be the official head of the 
Department and be responsible for its efficient 
administration and discipline, for the conduct of 
business assigned to the Department and for the 
observance of laws and rules, as has recently 
been developed by this Court in the case of PIA 
Officers Cooperative Housing Society Limited 
versus Province of Punjab etc. (2023 LHC 5208) 
(LHC Citation). Therefore, keeping in view the 
importance of forests in connection with climate 
change, a copy of this writ petition alongwith all 
the annexures is remitted to Secretary, Forestry, 
Wildlife and Fisheries Department, Punjab with a 
direction to first determine the validity of the 
impugned notification and then, if he/she feels 
necessary, may initiate the process of framing of 
requisite rules or extension of the existing rules to 
various Tehsils of District Rawalpindi in 
consultation with the Law & Parliamentary 
Affairs Department as required by Rule 20 of the 
2011 Rules, and thereafter, pass a speaking order 

11 
W.P.No.862/2020 
in the matter after granting fair opportunity of 
hearing to all concerned, including the Petitioner, 
by also keeping in mind the rationale rendered in 
the judgments mentioned above. The Secretary, 
while consulting the matter with the concerned 
department(s), shall also consider the guidelines/
