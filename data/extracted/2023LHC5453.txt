Mr. 
Muhammad

Advocate. 
Mr. Muhammad Sajjad Zaidi, Advocate. 
Mr. Khawar Shabbir Khan, Advocate.  
Respondents by: Mr. Imran Khan, Assistant Advocate

 Anwaar Hussain, J.  By way of factual background, it has 
been noted that in response to an advertisement published by the 
Police Department regarding the appointment to the post of 
Constable in District Gujranwala (“Police Department”), the 
petitioner applied for the said post, vide application Form No.1837, 
and successfully completed all formalities, however, the appointment 
was refused on the ground that, subsequent to the submission of his 
application, an FIR bearing No.68/2021, dated 11.01.2021, under 
Sections 427/182 of Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 (“the PPC”) and 29-
D of the Telegraph Act, 1885 was found to be registered against him 
at Police Station Sadar, Gujranwala.  
2. 
The petitioner approached this Court through a constitutional 
petition bearing W.P. No.49792/2022 while laying challenge to 

2 
     W.P. No.59263/2022 
 
 
rejection of his application in which the Police Department submitted 
a report, perusal whereof depicts that the petitioner has been refused 
appointment on the strength of Standing Order No.06/2015 dated 
09.07.2015 (“Standing Order”), which contemplates that a 
candidate having criminal record shall not be appointed. In the said 
round of litigation, the petitioner produced an order dated 03.06.2021 
passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate, Gujranwala whereby the 
petitioner was convicted and was placed on probation for a period of 
one year and it was specifically observed that the petitioner shall not 
be disqualified for any Government job or appointment in future. The 
rejection order was set aside by this Court and the matter was 
remitted to the Police Department for re-examination, keeping in 
view the finding of the learned Judicial Magistrate recorded in order 
dated 03.06.2021 as well as the object of the Probation of Offenders 
Ordinance, 1960 (“the Ordinance”). Upon re-consideration, the 
Police Department has passed the impugned order dated 19.09.2022 
whereby the representation of the petitioner has been turned down on 
the strength of the Standing Order.  
3. 
M/s Muhammad Talha Mushtaq, Muhammad Sajjad Zaidi and 
Khawar Shabbir Khan, Advocates, learned counsel for the petitioner 
submit that, while passing the impugned order, the object of the 
Ordinance has not been considered, purpose whereof is to provide an 
opportunity to the individuals, like the petitioner who are not 
hardened criminals, to reform themselves and, in this regard, places 
reliance upon case reported as “Inspector-General of Police Punjab, 
Lahore and others v. Mahmood Ikram” (1998 SCMR 765). Reliance 
has also been placed upon the reported judgment of this Court, dated 
12.09.2023, passed in W.P. No.50582 of 2022 titled “Syed Ali 
Hassan Naqvi v. Senior Superintendent of Police, etc.”, (2023 LHC 
4701) in which the Standing Order came under discussion and the 

3 
     W.P. No.59263/2022 
 
 
said petition was allowed, with the averments that the same is 
applicable to the present case on all fours.  
4. 
Conversely, Mr. Imran Khan, Assistant Advocate General 
submits that the case of the petitioner is distinguishable from that of 
Syed Ali Hassan Naqvi supra, inasmuch as, this Court has not struck 
down the departmental policy envisaged under the Standing Order 
rather has affirmed the same. He further contends that the facts of the 
present case are distinguishable from case of Syed Ali Hassan Naqvi 
supra. Elaborating his stance, learned Law Officer submits that in the 
said case, the petitioner therein was acquitted on merits by the 
learned Trial Court in a case registered against the said petitioner, 
whereas in the instant case, the petitioner, having been nominated in 
the FIR registered against him after submission of the application, 
confessed his crime and was accordingly convicted. Therefore, his 
candidature has been rightly rejected by the Police Department. 
Concludes that in case of Syed Ali Hassan Naqvi supra, this Court 
has held that opinion of the Investigating Agency should not be given 
preference over the acquittal on merits by the Court of competent 
jurisdiction, whereas, in the instant case, there is no acquittal rather 
the petitioner was set free on parole under the Ordinance after he 
confessed his guilt.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
6. 
This Court has already expressed its opinion as regards the 
scope of Standing Order in case of Syed Ali Hassan Naqvi supra and 
while reading down the applicable policy of the Police Department, 
envisaged thereunder, this Court held that the opinion of the 
Investigating Officer cannot be given preference over the judicial 
findings of acquittal of an accused applicant on the merits of the case. 
However, before rendering opinion in the instant case, it will be in 
fitness of things to reproduce relevant part of the instructions dated 

4 
     W.P. No.59263/2022 
 
 
29.07.2022, admittedly forming part of the Standing Order that reads 
as under: 
“III) All those candidates who during character 
verification have been found involved in criminal 
cases (either under trial or acquitted on multiple 
grounds) shall not be appointed in Police Department 
as constable, in the light of instructions issued vide this 
Office No.SE-IV/7317-70/II, dated 26.06.2014. 
IV) All the candidates submit an affidavit for non-
involvement in criminal cases at the time of 
submission of application forms and if the case is 
registered against an applicant after the last date of 
submission of application form, but the applicant is 
not challaned & declared innocent; then that 
would not be ground for rejection of an applicant. 
However DPO must examine that case is not 
cancelled or accused declared innocent due to 
compromise between parties in the light of para 23 of 
Standing Order No.06/2015 amended vide No.SE-
III/1105-60/XV dated 01.06.2018.”  
 
 
 
             (Emphasis supplied) 
 
7.  
This Court in case of Syed Ali Hassan Naqvi supra observed as 
under: 
“9. It has become stone-etched principle of law that 
mere registration of FIR does not render a person 
guilty of commission of a crime, under the law. 
Registration of FIR is merely a step to put the 
investigative machinery of the state into motion to 
collect the evidence, which may culminate into the 
acquittal or conviction of the accused by the competent 
Court of law, exercising judicial power of the state. 
While at the one end of the spectrum lies the 
fundamental rights of the petitioner to pursue a 
profession and/or business of his choice and to be dealt 
with in accordance with law, as envisaged under 
Article 4 of the Constitution, the need to maintain the 
police department as a disciplined force tasked with the 
obligation to maintain law and order in the society lies 
at the other end. Hence, any aspirant to join police 
force must not have criminal antecedents as the same 
may result in recruiting of such personnel who may 
create difficulties in maintaining the force as 
disciplined one.”  

5 
     W.P. No.59263/2022 
 
 
 
8.  
  It is clear that this Court in case of Syed Ali Hassan Naqvi 
supra read down the Standing Order in the manner that if the 
acquittal by the judicial limb of the State is on merit, a candidate 
should not be non-suited on the basis of the opinion of the 
investigating agency. While reading down the Standing Order in the 
stated manner, this Court was conscious of the balance required to be 
struck between the two opposite spectrums i.e., right of a citizen to 
join profession and/or calling of one’s own choice and to be dealt 
with in accordance with law on the one end and the public policy to 
maintain the police as a disciplined force by not recruiting those who 
possess criminal antecedents on the other.  Therefore, this Court in 
case of Syed Ali Hassan Naqvi supra has not ruled that the candidates 
who have been guilty and/or convicted on the basis of confession or 
otherwise are entitled to the recruitment in the Police Department.  
9. 
Moreover, it needs reiteration as well as elucidation that this 
Court saved the Standing Order in case of Syed Ali Hassan Naqvi 
supra by extending deference to the departmental policy incorporated 
therein by reading it down in the manner that acquittal by the Court 
of competent jurisdiction, on merits, cannot be overridden by the 
findings of the investigating officer as was the situation in Syed Ali 
Hassan Naqvi case and this aspect gets support from part IV of the 
Standing Order quoted hereinabove. Thus, the Standing Order, as a 
departmental policy, holds the field which is required to be given due 
deference unless found to be perverse and violative of the 
fundamental rights.  
10. 
Above discussion also entails the question whether a 
departmental policy, like the Standing Order, can be nullified or 
made redundant by the observations made by a Judicial Magistrate 
while releasing the accused/petitioner on parole after his confession 
with the observation that this conviction shall not have any impact on 

6 
     W.P. No.59263/2022 
 
 
the appointment to any government job in the future without looking 
into the nature of the policy(ies) of a particular department. This 
Court finds it hard to align itself to such a view. Even this Court in 
Constitutional jurisdiction cannot sit over the wisdom of the 
department reflected in a policy unless the same is found to be 
violative of fundamental rights or based on mala fide as observed 
hereinabove. In addition, such an observation may hold some 
persuasion in any other department but not in police force. Standard 
expected of a person intending to join a uniformed service like the 
Police Department is quite distinct, from other services, which is 
required to be more disciplined institution and inclusion of person 
having criminal antecedents could have bearing on the discipline of 
the force that is tasked to maintain law and order in the society.  
11. 
Moreover, besides the lack of jurisdiction of judicial 
magistrate to nullify or make redundant the policy of the Police 
Department, there is another aspect of the matter from which this 
case can be examined. In the instant case, the learned judicial 
magistrate has made observations that sending the petitioner on 
parole would have no bearing on his recruitment to any department in 
future whereas there is possibility that some other judicial magistrate 
in such like case(s) may not make any such observations with respect 
to some other applicant. This would engender a discrimination of its 
own kind having no lawful justification and possibility thereof cannot 
be ruled out. This also necessitates that in such eventualities it is left 
to the Police Department to scrutinize the cases of candidates, on 
individual basis, in accordance with its policy, envisaged under the 
Standing Order, without any discrimination.  
12. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner argued with full vigour and 
vitality that under Section 11 of the Ordinance, the conviction and 
release on probation does not have any bearing on eligibility of the 

7 
     W.P. No.59263/2022 
 
 
petitioner to the post of Constable and placed reliance on case of 
Inspector General of Police, Punjab supra. Therefore, it would be 
convenient to have a look at Section 11 of the Ordinance in general 
and its sub-section (2) in particular, which is reproduced as under: 
“11. Effects of discharge and probation.–  
(1) A conviction of an offence, for which an order is 
made under section 4 or section 5 for discharging the 
offender after the due admonition or conditionally or 
placing him on probation, shall be deemed not to be a 
conviction for any purpose other than the purposes of 
the proceedings in which the order is made and of any 
subsequent proceedings which may be taken against the 
offender under the provisions of this Ordinance: 
Provided that where an offender, being not less than 
eighteen years of age at the time of his conviction of an 
offence 
for 
which 
an 
order 
discharging 
him 
conditionally or placing him on probation is made, is 
subsequently sentenced under this Ordinance for that 
offence, the provisions of this sub-section shall cease to 
apply to the conviction. 
(2) Without prejudice to the foregoing provisions of this 
section, the conviction of an offender who is discharged 
after due admonition or conditionally, or who is placed 
on probation, shall in any event be disregarded for the 
purposes of any law which imposes any disqualification 
or disability upon convicted persons, or authorizes or 
requires the imposition of any such disqualification or 
disability.” 
This provision has been interpreted by the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
in case of Inspector General of Police, Punjab supra wherein it has 
been observed as under: 
“14……Bare perusal, disclose that disqualification or 
disability mentioned therein is not directly relateable to 
conviction for an offence wherein offender has been 
granted 
probation 
but 
contemplates 
any 
disqualification or disability specifically provided or 
something attached to such law which should be 
ignored while applying abovereferred provisions of the 
Ordinance. Therefore, for all practical purposes the 
facility of probation does not altogether obliterate the 

8 
     W.P. No.59263/2022 
 
 
conviction, but eliminates its impact by lifting away 
disqualification attached to any other law.”  
 
After scanning catena of judgments on the object and scope of the 
Ordinance, the Supreme Court conclusively held as under:- 
“19. On considering the principle of law discussed 
above, we feel inclined to hold that by virtue of section 
11(2) Probation of Offenders Ordinance, 1960, the 
offender gets an opportunity of rehabilitation in the 
society without stigma of conviction provided the offence 
is not repeated and terms of bond furnished by him for 
good conduct and peace are honoured till stipulated 
period; nevertheless in case of Government servant 
without prejudice to benefit available under aforesaid 
enactment, the Departmental Authority is not precluded 
from initiating action for misconduct under relevant 
Efficiency and Discipline Rules.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
It is well evident from the above that in case of Inspector General of 
Police Punjab, supra the appeal of the Police Department was 
accepted and the department was held to be not precluded to proceed 
against the delinquent serving Police Officer even after his Probation 
under the Ordinance. Therefore, if the Police Department was 
allowed to proceed on account of misconduct in respect of a serving 
Police official under the applicable service rules, it cannot be 
construed that the Police Department, on the same analogy, cannot 
reject the candidature of an applicant on the basis of departmental 
policy envisaged under the Standing Order.  
13. 
Even otherwise and without prejudice to the above, if the 
contention and reliance of the counsel of the petitioner on case of 
Inspector General of Police Punjab, supra is considered the way the 
counsel of the petitioner pleaded and wants this Court to read, even 
then the same is of no help to the petitioner as the Standing Order 
was not in field at the time when the decision was rendered in 
referred case and never came under discussion before the Supreme 

9 
     W.P. No.59263/2022 
 
 
Court of Pakistan. Hence, the reliance is misplaced on this ground as 
well.  
14. 
In view of the above discussion, this Court is of the opinion 
that the present petition has no merit and hence, dismissed.
