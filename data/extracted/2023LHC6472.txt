2. 
Brief facts of the case are that the respondent No.1/Ghyas 
Ahmad Rana while serving as Deputy Controller of Branches 
Inspection and Audit Team ‘A’, Agricultural Development Bank 
of Pakistan, Lahore filed an application to the Minister, Evacuee 
& Trust Properties, Islamabad on 05.02.1977 for allotment of one 
plot measuring 02 Kanal in Lahore on the ground that he did not 
own any land or house. The Minister for Religious Affairs 
recommended for allotment of a plot measuring 01 Kanal situated 
at Elgen Road, Lahore Cantt on lease for a period of 99 years to 
the respondent No.1/Ghayyas Ahmad Rana. In compliance of the 
said order, a plot measuring 01 Kanal in Lahore Cantonment 
was leased out to respondent No.1 and possession was also 
handed over to him. However, the Federal Government as well 
as the petitioner-Board after examining the case of lease, came 
to the conclusion that the said lease was made contrary to the 
provision of the Evacuee Property and Displaced Persons Laws 
(Repeal) Act, 1975 and cancelled the lease vide letter dated 
30.11.1978.  
  
After a period of about six years, Ghayyas Ahmad Rana, 
respondent No.1 filed a complaint to the Wafaqi Mohtasib with 
the contention that lease of plot in question in his favour was 
illegally cancelled. Wafaqi Mohtasib vide order dated 17.04.1986 
set aside the cancellation order dated 30.11.1978 and passed 
direction that plot on Elgan Road, Lahore should be re-leased to 
respondent No.1 and in case the said plot has already been leased 
to someone else than any other alternate plot in the same locality 
be leased to respondent No.1. By the dint of above order, the 
respondent No.1 approached the petitioner-Board on 02.08.1987 
for implementation of order dated 17.04.1986 passed by Wafaqi 
Mohtasib. In compliance of order dated 17.04.1986, the 
petitioner-Board leased the plot to the respondent No.1 and 

 
W.P.No.17384/2000 
 
3
informed Wafaqi Mohtasib that possession has been delivered to 
the respondent No.1.  
  
The respondent No.1 filed another application on 
25.11.1990 before Wafaqi Mohtasib upon which direction was 
passed to the petitioner-Board for lease of another plot measuring 
01 Kanal to the respondent No.1. A review application was filed 
by the respondent No.1 to the Wafaqi Mohtasib with the plea that 
the petitioner-Board has not complied with the order dated 
17.04.1986 in letter and spirit. The said review application was 
allowed by the Wafaqi Mohtasib on 07.12.1991 and a direction 
was passed to the petitioner-Board for compliance of earlier 
orders. The petitioner-Board also filed review application which 
was dismissed by the Wafaqi Mohtasib on 27.09.1992. The 
petitioner-Board filed representation before the President, Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan who dismissed the said representation being 
time barred on 21.01.1998. The petitioner-Board has challenged 
the aforesaid orders through instant Writ Petition.  
  
This writ petition was earlier dismissed by this Court vide 
judgment dated 24.11.2004. The petitioner-Board assailed the 
said judgment through Civil Petition No.365-L of 2011 which 
was allowed vide order dated 03.11.2016 by the Supreme Court 
of Pakistan and the case was remanded to this Court for decision 
afresh on merit in accordance with law.

I have heard learned counsels for the parties and have 
gone through the record. 
4. 
The issue involved in this case can be formulated in the 
shape of following questions:  
i.  
Whether a Minister holds the authority to make 
recommendation/proposal to the Evacuee Trust Property 
Board to grant an evacuee property to any specific person 
on lease without adopting the procedure laid down in 
law? 

 
W.P.No.17384/2000

ii.   
Whether Wafaqi Mohtasib has jurisdiction to pass 
direction to any department to comply with any 
recommendation made by a Minister?  
Under Section 30 of the Evacuee Trust Properties (Management 
& Disposal) Act, 1975, “The Scheme for the Management & 
Disposal of Urban Evacuee Trust Properties, 1977” was approved 
by the Federal Government vide letter No.18-20/75-ETP, dated 
17.07.1976 and as per Chapter III, Rule 7(i) of the said Scheme 
an open plot may be leased out by public auction or by inviting 
tender. For ready reference, aforesaid provision is reproduced as 
under: 
 “7. LEASE OF OPEN PLOTS 
(i)    An open plot comprising an area not exceeding five kanal may 
be leased out by public auction or by inviting tender, after wide 
publicity through the press and local mushtary munadi for 
residential or commercial purpose by the Chairman and that 
exceeding five kanals by the Board initially for a period of 30 years 
renewable for a similar period of periods. 
       Provided that if no bid or offer is received in three 
consecutive public auctions or tenders or the response is not 
worth consideration or is below the reserve price, the Board 
may allow lease at the negotiated rate plus the amount of non-
refundable security to be decided on case to case basis. 
….. 
(iv)  The auction of plots or sites shall be held by a committee 
comprising:- 
(a) A representation of the Board’s Headquarters not 
below the rank of Deputy Secretary, to be 
nominated by the Chairman; 
(b) Administrator of the concerned Zone. 
(c) Deputy 
Administrator/Assistant 
Administrator 
concerned; and 
(d) A representative of District Revenue Officer not 
below BPS-16 officer. 
 
Provided that three members shall constitute the 
quorum of the Committee.   
(v) Lease exceeding 30 years shall be subject to the approval 
of the Federal Government.”  
The respondent No.1 filed application for lease of plot measuring 
01 Kanal to the Minister for Evacuee & Trust Properties, 

 
W.P.No.17384/2000 
 
5
Islamabad upon which following recommendations were made by 
him on 05.02.1977: 
“One kanal plot on Elgan Road, Lahore Cantt. may be allotted 
on ninety nine years lease at the rate of Rs. One per square 
yard per annum, five thousand rupees may be charged as 
down payment.” 
5. 
The Evacuee Trust Properties (Management & Disposal) 
Act, 1975 is a special law which provides mechanism for the 
management, lease and disposal of the evacuee trust properties.  
In the Act as well as Scheme ibid no provision is available 
whereby any authority is vested with the Minister to make 
recommendations to the petitioner-Board for lease of any plot to 
any individual. This Court in a similar controversy has 
elaborately discussed and settled this issue in a recent judgment 
which has been cited as Ch. Munir Ahmad Vs. Government of 
Punjab through Chief Secretary, Punjab Lahore and others (PLD 
2022 Lahore 384), Province of Punjab through Secretary 
Revenue and others Vs. District Bar Association, Khanewal and 
others (2014 SCMR 1611), American International School 
System Vs. Mian Muhammad Ramzan and others (2015 SCMR 
1449), wherein it is blatantly observed that a Minister is denuded 
of any power to issue, any such recommendations for lease of 
plot and if any recommendation is so made that would be patently 
illegal and without lawful authority, as it is settled law that any 
order passed by an authority without having jurisdiction that 
order would be void ab-initio. Reliance is placed on the cases 
reported as Raja Ali Zaman (decd.) through L.Rs. and another Vs. 
Evacuee Trust Property Board and another (PLD 2022 SC 726), 
Khuda Bakhsh Vs. Khushi Muhammad and 3 others (PLD 1976 
SC 208), Bashir Ahmad Vs. Meer Aslam Jan (2007 CLC 1544), 
Messrs East-West Insurance Company Ltd. through Chairman & 
Another Vs. Messrs Muhammad Shafi & Company through 
Managing Partner & 2 Others (2009 CLD 960) and reliance is 

 
W.P.No.17384/2000 
 
6
also placed on an unreported judgment dated 18.04.2017 
rendered by a learned Division Bench of this Court in case titled 
as Sultan Vs. Federation of Pakistan and 4 others (Writ Petition 
No.28756 of 2014) as well as on a recent pronouncement dated 
08.11.2023 passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
Civil Petition No.13-Q of 2020 titled as Gul Zaman Vs. Deputy 
Commissioner/Collector Gwadar & others, thus well considered 
resume of above is that any recommendation of the Minister for 
grant/ lease of the plot are liable to be quashed being void ab-
initio and any superstructure built on the basis whereof shall also 
be dismantled automatically.  
6. 
As regard the second question that Whether Wafaqi 
Mohtasib has jurisdiction to pass direction to any department to 
comply with any recommendation made by a Minister? is concerned, 
suffice it to say that the office of Wafaqi Mohtasib was created 
under the “Establishment of the Office of Wafaqi Mohtasib 
(Ombudsman) Order, 1983” dated 24.01.1983 whereby under 
Section 9 of the Order ibid, the jurisdiction, functions and powers 
of Mohtasib are provided, which are reproduced as under: 
 “9. Jurisdiction, functions and power of the Mohtasib.—(1) The 
Mohtasib may, on a complaint by any aggrieved person, on a 
reference by the President, the Federal Council or the National 
Assembly, as the case may be, or on a motion of the Supreme Court 
or a High Court made during the course of any proceedings before it 
or of his own motion, undertake any investigation into any 
allegation of maladministration on the part of any Agency or any of 
its officers or employees: 
  
Provided that the Mohtasib shall not have any jurisdiction to 
investigate or inquire into any matters which: 
  
(a) are sub-judice before a court of competent jurisdiction or 
tribunal or board in Pakistan on the date of the receipt of a 
complaint, reference or motion by him; or 
  
(b) relate to the external affairs of Pakistan or the relations or 
dealing of Pakistan with any foreign state or government; or 
  
(c) relate to, or are connected with the defence of Pakistan or 
any part thereof, the military, naval and air forces of Pakistan, or the 
matters covered by the laws relating to those forces. 
  
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in clause (1), the 
Mohtasib shall not accept for investigation any complaint by or on 
behalf of a public servant or functionary concerning any matters 

 
W.P.No.17384/2000 
 
7
relating to the Agency in which he is, or has been, working in 
respect of any personal grievance relating to his service therein. 
  
(3) For carrying out the objectives of this Order and, in 
particular for ascertaining the root causes of corrupt practices and 
injustice, the Mohtasib may arrange for studies to be made or 
research to be conducted and may recommend appropriate steps for 
their eradication. 
  
(4) The Mohtasib may set up regional offices as, when and 
where required.” 
The case for lease of plot owned by the petitioner-Board to the 
respondent No.1 does not fall within the jurisdiction of Wafaqi 
Mohtasib as provided in Section 9 of the Order ibid. There is no 
evidence brought on record by the respondent No.1 regarding any 
malpractice committed by the petitioner-Board and if any 
cancellation of the plot in question was made by the petitioner-
Board, the respondent No.1 has remedy of filing Revision before 
the Federal Government under Section 17 of the Evacuee Trust 
Properties (Management & Disposal) Act, 1975. Reliance in this 
regard is placed on a case cited as Mster Chiragh Din Vs. Abdul 
Hakim and Another (PLD 1974 Lahore 370). 
  
7. 
Admittedly all the affairs of the state are managed and run 
by the instrument of written constitution as well laws and 
functions/ business of each and every department is to be carried 
out under the well described manifest written jurisdiction and 
each portfolio has to exercise its powers with the described 
precincts of its jurisdiction and any transgression whereof would 
be considered as illegal. Moreover according to Section 23 of the 
Contract Act, 1872, if any order is passed by any authority 
beyond its jurisdiction and against the public policy, such order in 
its inception is nullity in the eyes of law and never convey any 
absolute title in favour of the beneficiary. For ready reference, 
Section 23 of the Act ibid is reproduced as under: 
“23. What considerations and objects are lawful and what not. The 
consideration or object of an agreement is lawful, unless:--it is 
forbidden by law; or is of such a nature that, if permitted, it would 
defeat the provisions of any law; or  

 
W.P.No.17384/2000 
 
8
 
is fraudulent; or involves or implies injury to the person or 
property of another; or 
  
the Court regards it as immoral, or opposed to public 
policy. In each of these cases, the consideration or object of an 
agreement is said to be unlawful. Every agreement of which the 
object or consideration is unlawful is void.” 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
With regard to contract against law and public policy, the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case titled as Hameedullah and 9 
others Vs. Headmistress, Government Girls School Chokara, 
District Karak and 5 others (1997 SCMR 855) held that:- 
“From the aforestated observations it is clear that the 
agreement between the Government and the appellant was in 
the nature of sale of a public office, consideration being the 
transfer of land. Sale of public office cannot be a legal 
transaction. It is completely illegal and against public policy. 
Therefore, such an agreement is hit by section 23 of the 
Contract Act, which makes it void.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
The Supreme Court in a case titled as Maulana Abdul Haque 
Baloch and others Vs. Government of Balochistan through 
Secretary Industries and Mineral Development and others (PLD 
2013 SC 641) has held as under:- 
“The competent authority also failed to determine the terms 
and conditions to be fixed in granting the relaxations sought 
for. In this view of the matter, in absence of the requirements 
of rule 98 being fulfilled in the instant case, all relaxations 
were granted in excess of authority and were entirely beyond 
the scope of the provisions of law, and therefore, ultra vires the 
powers granted under rule 98 of BMCR 1970 read with section 
5 of the Act of 1948, and thus void. Shorn of relaxations so 
grant, CHEJVA has no legal sanctity and consequently 
remains an agreement entered into against the provisions of 
law, hence not enforceable. 
 
All the key provisions of CHEJVA were made subject to a 
reliance on relaxations that were illegal and void ab initio, the 
illegality of the agreement seeps to its root. As such, no 
operative part of the agreement survives to be independently 
enforceable and the principle of severability cannot be applied 
to save any part thereof. The agreement is, therefore, void and 
unenforceable in its entirety under the law.”  
 

 
W.P.No.17384/2000

In another judgment titled as Muhammad Arshad Khakwani Vs. 
I.U.B. and another (2011 MLD 322) this Court has held that:- 
“No doubt the Statutory bodies are governed under the Act, 
rules, regulations and statutes which are meant for the said 
purpose and no one is allowed to supersede the same. The 
University functionaries are presumed to act under the law and 
no one can exceed from its domain neither supersede nor 
deviate. If the provisions of the Act are not complied with then 
the Institutions cannot run smoothly as is required by the law 
and the guarantees provided by the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973.” 
 
8.  
It is settled law when the basic order has been passed 
without jurisdiction and without lawful authority, then all the 
superstructure built on the said order shall automatically 
collapse/crumble down. Reliance is placed on the case of 
Rehmatullah & Others Vs. Saleh Khan & Others (2007 SCMR 
729).  
9. 
The land in question is admittedly a public asset and the 
Courts of law are custodian of the public properties, public 
interest and while dealing with matters relating to such 
properties/assets or interests, it is inalienable obligation of the 
courts to be very careful and cautious and assure itself to the 
extent of certainty that no foul is being played with the state 
assets. An extraordinary obligation is placed upon the courts to 
keep abreast itself with law and facts of the case and when certain 
material facts unearthed before it then the matter should be 
decided as per law even without being influenced by respective 
pleadings of the parties. In this regard, reliance is placed on a 
judgment cited as Provincial Government through Collector, 
Kohat and another Versus Shabbir Hussain (PLD 2005 SC 337), 
wherein the Supreme Court of the country has held as under:- 
 
“12. Likewise, the learned Presiding Officers are also required 
to exercise caution when they are dealing with matters relating 
to public property and public interest of which the Courts of 
law are the final custodians. It is true that we have never 
leaned in favour of giving of preferential treatment to the 

 
W.P.No.17384/2000 
 
10
Government departments or agencies but then we are equally 
obliged, while granting relief, to ensure that public interest is 
not permitted to be jeopardized and public property is not 
allowed to be squandered through mere collusion of some 
representative of a Government agency”. 
 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
Further reliance is placed on cases cited as Al-shafique Housing 
Society Vs. P.M.A (PLD 1992 SC 113), Union Council Dhabeji 
Vs. Al-Noor Textile Mills Ltd (1993 SCMR 7), Multiline 
Associates Vs. Ardeshir Cowasjee (PLD 1995 SC 423), Abdul 
Haq Indher Vs. Province of Sindh (2007 SCMR 907), Taj 
Muhammad Vs. Town Committee (1994 CLC 2214) and Sindh 
Peoples Welfare Trust Vs. Government of Sindh (2005 CLC 
713). 
10. 
Resultantly, this writ petition is allowed and the impugned 
orders, mentioned in paragraph No.1 of this judgment, are hereby 
set aside. Consequently, the lease of the plots in question in 
favour of respondent No.1 is hereby cancelled being illegal and 
void ab-initio. The petitioner-Board is directed to proceed further 
in the matter strictly in accordance with law.
