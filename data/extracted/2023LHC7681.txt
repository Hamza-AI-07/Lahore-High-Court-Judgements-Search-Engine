Through this constitutional petition, the petitioners 
have called in question order dated 02.11.2022 passed by 
the trial court, whereby application under Order I Rule 10 
CPC, 
filed 
by 
Shumaila 
Syed/respondent 
No.3 
(“respondent”) was allowed with the result that she being 
wife/widow was allowed to be impleaded as party to the 
pending suit as legal heir of deceased Syed Saqlain 
Shahana (“deceased”), predecessor-in-interest of the 
petitioners and respondents Nos. 6 to 8. The petitioners 
have also challenged the order dated 10.01.2023 passed 
by the revisional court, whereby revision petition filed by 
the petitioners against the aforesaid order had been 
dismissed.   
2. 
The contention of the petitioners is that respondent 
No.3 had been divorced by deceased in his lifetime and 
this was the reason that said respondent was not provided 
share in his inheritance, as evident from Mutation No. 
510 dated 24.07.2007, by virtue of which property of 
deceased was inherited by only Bushra Begum (mother), 

2 
WP No.8728 of 2023  
Dated 09.02.2023 
Hassan Ali (son) and Amna Syed (daughter) to the 
exclusion of respondent No.3. Besides previously during 
lifetime of Bushra Begum, mother of the deceased, 
respondent No.3 was never impleaded as a party to any 
legal proceedings, therefore, she could not later on claim 
to be widow and legal heir of deceased to be impleaded 
as a party.   
3. 
Perusal of record shows that both the courts below 
have taken the said aspect into consideration while 
deciding the matter. The learned trial court allowed the 
application under Order I Rule 10 CPC for impleading 
Shumaila Syed, respondent as a party by observing as 
under: 
“Assertion of the Applicant Shumaila Syed is that she is the 
wife of deceased Syed Saqlain Shahana therefore, she may 
be impleaded as plaintiff to the suit being a necessary party 
in the suit whereas contention of the respondents/plaintiffs 
no. 1Ai to 1Aiii is that Applicant Shumaila Syed was 
divorced by the deceased Syed Saqlain Shahana since 17 
years ago. Respondents/Plaintiffs no. 1Ai to 1Aiii have 
admitted that Applicant was the wife of deceased Syed 
Saqlain Shahana but she got divorced from the court. In 
this regard respondents/Plaintiffs no. 1Ai to 1Aiii have not 
produced a decree of the court or effectiveness certificate 
issued by concerned union council. In such circumstances, 
where factual controversy involved between the parties, the 
same should be decided after recording of evidence. So, 
considering the Applicant a necessary party to be 
impleaded in this case in the array of plaintiffs. Hence, 
application in hand is accepted.  
 
4. 
The learned Court that decided the revision upheld 
the order of trial court by observing as under: 
“The impugned order dated 02.11.2022 is with respect to 
the impleadment of respondent No.1 Shumaila Syed as 
party to the suit on account of being widow of deceased 
Saqlain Shahana.  There is no denial to the fact that 
respondent No.1 remained in matrimonial ties with 
deceased Saqlain Shahana however there is no such valid 
record which could justify that deceased Saqlain Shahana 
prior to his death had pronounced divorce to said 
respondent No.1 Shumaila Syed.  Though during the course 
of arguments, learned counsel for the petitioners has 
produced copy of mutation No.510 dated 24.07.2007 by 
virtue of which the property of deceased Saqlain Shahana 

3 
WP No.8728 of 2023  
Dated 09.02.2023 
was inherited by only Bushra Begum (mother), Hassan Ali 
(Son) as well as Amina Syed (daughter), however this 
document could not be treated as a valid proof of divorce 
to respondent No.1 Shumaila Syed.  The other documents 
including power of attorney in favour of respondent No.1 
Shumaila Syed and agreement to sale of property by her as 
well as copy of suit titled “Shumaila Syed. Vs. Bushran 
Begum etc” filed at Renala Khurd, Okara could also not be 
treated as proof of divorce.  Factual controversy between 
the parties could not be attended while exercising the 
revisional jurisdiction as this domain pertains to learned 
trial court and same could be redressed through recording 
of evidence and same has been observed by the learned 
trial court through impugned order. 
For what has been discussed above, I find neither any 
illegality or irregularity in the impugned order nor the 
jurisdictional error.  Instant civil revision is hereby 
dismissed.” 
 
5. 
In the aforesaid orders it is specifically mentioned 
that despite claim of the petitioners that respondent No.3 
had been divorced by deceased, there was no document 
to that effect available on record to establish the factum 
of divorce and merely because she was not included in 
inheritance of the deceased while entering mutation 
No.510 dated 24.07.2007 in the revenue record, the same 
does not amount to be a conclusive proof  of the fact as to 
whether she had been divorced by deceased in his 
lifetime.  Besides said aspect of the matter, as to whether 
she had been divorced or not cannot be determined 
summarily and has to be decided after recording of 
evidence and in the meanwhile while proceeding with the 
matter for the reason that she was shown to be previously 
the wife of the deceased the Applicant has to be assumed 
to widow of the deceased, in view of Illustration “d” of 
Article 129 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, which 
provides that a thing that previously existed may be 
presumed to continue till it was established that its 
existence had come to an end.  The relevant part of the 
said Article is reproduced below: 

4 
WP No.8728 of 2023  
Dated 09.02.2023 
“129. Court may presume existence of certain facts.—
The Court may presume the existence of any fact which it 
thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the 
common course of natural events, human conduct and 
public and private business, in their relation to the facts of 
the particular case-- 
Illustrations 
The Court may presume— 
(a) ……. 
(b) ……. 
(c) ……. 
(d) that a thing or state of things which has been shown to 
be in existence within a period shorter than that within 
which such things or state of things usually cease to 
exist, is still in existence.  
………” 
 
6. 
Similar matter came up for hearing before the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in case titled Haji Allah Ditta 
through Legal heirs and others versus Ahmad Nawaz and 
others reported as 2003 SCMR 981, where it was 
observed as under: 
“2. The facts relevant to the present case are that the 
petitioners late Haji Allah Ditta and late Haji Allah Rakha 
(represented by their legal heirs/successors-in-interest) 
filed a suit of declaration that they were owners in 
possession of the suit-land as described in the heading of 
plaint and that Mutation No.361, dated 12-6-1985 in 
favour, of respondents as legal heirs of Ghulam Qadir 
deceased was illegal and inoperative qua their rights. It 
was stated in the plaint that late Ghulam Qadir was the 
original owner of the suit-land. He died issueless on 11-2-
1985. Therefore, the, petitioners being his real brothers 
were the only legal heirs of the deceased under the Muslim 
Law of Inheritance mutation of inheritance was initially 
entered in their favour. It was subsequently altered and 
Mutation No.361 was sanctioned in favour of the 
respondents showing them as sons and widow of Ghulam 
Qadir deceased. However, the petitioners admitted in para. 
6 of the plaint that Ghulam Qadir had married respondent 
No.4, in the year 1932 but stated that she was minor at that 
time. 
 
4. We have heard the learned counsel at length. The factum 
of marriage of Mst. Pathani, the respondent No.4 with 
Ghulam Qadir stands proved. No documentary evidence 
was produced to show dissolution of their marriage. The 
High Court as well as the trial Court were justified in 
taking the view on the basis of evidence on record that 
respondent No.4 Mst. Pathani was the widow and 
respondents Nos, 1 to 3 were the sons of Ghulam Qadir 
deceased who were entitled to inherit his property. In the 
case of Ismail Ahmed Peepadi v. Momina Bibi and others 

5 
WP No.8728 of 2023  
Dated 09.02.2023 
(AIR 1941 Privy Council 11; 1990 Pakistan Supreme Court 
Cases (PSC) 837) the Privy Council held that it was open 
to the Court upon the proof of the marriage having taken 
place on a certain date to regard as proved the subsistence 
of the marriage on a subsequent date unless and until it 
should be disproved. It was further held that continuance of 
marriage need not be shown in any special manner. The 
same view was taken by a Division Bench of the Calcutta 
High Court in the case of Chandu Lal Agarwal and another 
v. Bibi Khatemonnessa and others (AIR 1943 Calcutta 76). 
Illustration (d) of Article 129 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat 
Order, 1984 (10 of, 1984) also makes it clear that the 
Court may presume that a thing or state of things which 
has been shown to exist to be in existence within a period 
shorter than that within which such things or state of things 
usually cease to exist is still in existence. 
 
5. The High Court has taken the correct view that the 
petitioners nowhere averred in their plaint that Mst. 
Pathani had been divorced and was subsequently married 
to Muhammad Nawaz. It was also not pleaded that the 
respondents Nos 1 to 3 were the sons of Muhammad 
Nawaz. It is also in evidence that marriage of Ghulam 
Qadir was in exchange of marriage of his sister Mst. 
Rehmatan with the brother of Mst. Pathani” 
 
7. 
In view of the principles laid down in the judgment 
of the Supreme Court and the illustration(d) of Article 
129 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 reproduced 
above, as it is an admitted fact that the respondent 
Shumaila Syed was earlier married to Syed Saqlain 
Shahana (deceased) and nothing is available on the 
record such as decree of divorce passed by the court or 
divorce effectiveness certificate to show that she had 
been divorced by the deceased, she is to be presumed to 
be his widow and that marriage subsisted till death of the 
deceased, until and unless it is established on record 
through evidence that respondent No.3 had been divorced 
by deceased failing which factum of divorce or its 
effectiveness cannot be assumed.  Therefore, there is no 
illegality or jurisdictional defect in the impugned orders 
passed by both the courts below, whereby application 
under Order I Rule 10 CPC filed by respondent No.3 to 
implead her as a party has been rightly allowed.

For what has been discussed above, this petition 
being devoid of any force is dismissed.
