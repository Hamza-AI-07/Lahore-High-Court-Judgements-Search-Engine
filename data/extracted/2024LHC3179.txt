2. 
Brief facts of the case are that proceedings under Section 
122 of the “Ordinance” (Tax Years 2010, 2011 and 2012) were 
initiated against the Respondent No.1, on failure to submit 
satisfactory explanation by him which resulted into deemed 
assessments under Section 122(1) of the “Ordinance” vide 
order dated 31.12.2014. Further, undeclared balances were 
added under Section 111(1)(b) of the “Ordinance” (Tax Years 
2010, 2011 and 2012) vide order dated 20.01.2015. The 
Respondent No.1 filed appeal against both orders before the 
Commissioner Inland Revenue (BTB), Rawalpindi which 
confirmed the additions vide order dated 30.03.2015 that was 
further challenged by the parties through cross appeals before 
the “Appellate Tribunal”, which cancelled the assessments 
made under Section 122(1) of the “Ordinance” by the 
Commissioner Inland Revenue (BTB), Rawalpindi 
vide 
impugned order dated 17.11.2018 on ground of jurisdiction, 
hence these applications. The operative part of the impugned 
order reads as: 
“The impugned orders of amendment of 
assessment u/s 122(1) for all the years under 
appeal are illegal for having been passed by 
Commissioner BTB who did not have 
jurisdiction 
in 
the 
cases 
of 
existing 
taxpayers”.  
 
3. 
Learned counsel for the applicant-department submits that 
the “Appellate Tribunal” has passed the impugned order ignoring 
the jurisdiction of Commissioner Inland Revenue (BTB) 
Rawalpindi vested on him specifically by the Chief Commissioner 
in terms of Section 209(1) of the “Ordinance” vide order dated 
20.08.2014.  
4. 
On the other side, learned counsel for the Respondent 
submits that the impugned order has been passed strictly in 
accordance with law and does not require any interference by this 
Court.

Needless to say that the “Appellate Tribunal” is the last 
fact finding forum in hierarchy of Taxation Laws, therefore, it is 
bound to discharge its functions diligently. Any opinion, on law, 
by the “Appellate Tribunal” would lose credence for 
consideration by High Court in advisory jurisdiction, if findings of 
fact arrived at by it are not trustworthy. In these applications, 
exercise of jurisdiction by the Commissioner Inland Revenue 
(BTB), Regional Tax Office, Rawalpindi is questioned. We are 
constrained to observe that “Appellate Tribunal” has failed to 
properly consider jurisdiction vested with the Commissioner 
Inland Revenue (BTB), Rawalpindi in the Respondent’s case vide 
order dated 20.08.2014. Section 209 of the “Ordinance” deals 
with the jurisdiction of income tax authorities which reads as 
209. Jurisdiction of income tax authorities.---[(1) Subject to 
this 
Ordinance, 
the 
[Chief 
Commissioners], 
the 
Commissioners and the Commissioners (Appeals) shall 
perform all or such functions and exercise all or such 
powers under this Ordinance as may be assigned to them in 
respect of such persons or classes of persons or such areas 
as the [Board] may direct. 
 
 
Provided that the Board or the Chief Commissioner, 
as the case may be, may transfer jurisdiction in respect of 
cases or persons from one Commissioner to another.] 
 
7. 
Above provision of law is quite clear while dealing 
jurisdiction of income tax authorities as defined under Section 207 
and their appointments in terms of Section 208 of the 
“Ordinance”. Section 209(1) of the “Ordinance” empowers the 
Chief Commissioners, the Commissioners and the Commissioners 
(Appeals) to perform and exercise powers as assigned to them in 
respect of persons or classes or areas on the directions of the 
Board. While proviso to Section 209 of the “Ordinance” 
empowers both the FBR and the Chief Commissioner to transfer 
jurisdiction in respect of cases or persons from one Commissioner 
to another. Above said section has already been elaborated in 
“CHENAB FLOUR & GENERAL MILLS versus FEDERATION

OF PAKISTAN and others” (PLD 2021 Lahore 343) wherein it 
has held as under:  
“22. From plain reading of aforesaid section, it 
quite clear that this Section specifically deals with 
the jurisdiction of the income tax authorities. The 
income tax authorities are defined under Section 
207 of the Ordinance while their appointments are 
made in terms of Section 208 of the Ordinance by 
the Board. According to Section 209(1), the Chief 
Commissioners, 
the 
Commissioners 
and 
the 
Commissioners (Appeals) perform and exercise 
powers as assigned to them in respect of persons or 
classes or areas on the directions of the Board 
(FBR). While Proviso to Section 209 of the 
Ordinance empowers both to the FBR and the Chief 
Commissioner to transfer jurisdiction in respect of 
cases or persons from one Commissioner to 
another. The definition of the term ‘Commissioner’ 
as provided under Section 2 (13) of the Ordinance, 
postulates that Commissioner” means a person 
appointed as Commissioner Inland Revenue under 
section 208 and includes any other authority 
vested with all or any of the powers and functions 
of 
the 
Commissioner. 
This 
leads 
to 
the 
unambiguous conclusion that Commissioner also 
includes any authority, which is vested with all or 
any 
of 
the 
power 
and 
functions 
of 
the 
Commissioner. Perusal of Impugned Notification 
clearly unveils that the same was competently 
issued under enabling provisions of the law and 
validly conferred jurisdiction of the Commissioner 
under the Ordinance pertaining to particular class 
of taxpayers as envisages under Section 209, sub-
section (8A) of which also provides that ‘the power 
to confer jurisdiction under this section shall 
include the power to transfer jurisdiction from one 
income tax authority to another’. Section 211 (3) of 
the Ordinance further laid down the same that ‘The 
Board or, with the approval of the Board, an 
authority appointed under this Ordinance, shall be 
competent to exercise all powers conferred upon 
any authority subordinate to it.’ 
 
8. 
 In the case in hand, the Chief Commissioner, vide order 
dated 20.08.2014 transferred jurisdiction in respect of Respondent 
No.1’ case from Additional Commissioner Inland Revenue, Audit

9. 
Record also indicative of the fact that the Respondent 
No.1 had not taken the objection with regard to jurisdiction of 
Commissioner Inland Revenue (BTB), Regional Tax Office, 
Rawalpindi at the time of filing reply to show cause notice or at

time of filing appeal before the Commissioner of Inland 
Revenue (Appeals-III), Rawalpindi. It has been held in case of 
“CHIEF ENGINEER, HYDEL (NORTH) AND PROJECT 
DIRECTOR, WAPDA, WARSAK versus ZAFRULLAH SHAH 
and another” (2003 SCMR 686) that “no objection to the 
jurisdiction of a Court or Tribunal is taken in the forum of first 
instance it cannot be raised either in appeal or in revision.” 
Even otherwise, no prejudice is caused to Respondent No.1 in 
connection with question of jurisdiction in light of 
aforementioned order dated 20.08.2014, which speaks loud and 
clear on aspect of jurisdiction absolutely against stance 
assumed by the Respondent No.1, which order dated 
20.08.2014 has either not been gone through by “Appellate 
Tribunal” or the same has been skipped by him. As such, 
impugned order dated 17.11.2018, being outcome of non-
reading and misreading of record, is not sustainable in the 
eye of law. 
10. 
In view of above, these Reference Applications are 
decided in favour of the Applicant. 
11. 
Office shall send a copy of this order under seal of the 
Court to the “Appellate Tribunal” as per Section 133(5) of the 
“Ordinance”.
