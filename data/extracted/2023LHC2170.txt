Date of hearing 12.04.2023 
Appellant  
represented by: 
Jam Muhammad Nasir Fayyaz, Advocate.    
Respondents 
by: 
Mr. Muhammad Jafar, Law Officer for the 
Respondent No.1 and Election Commission of 
Pakistan. 
Rao Abdul Raheem, Advocate for the respondent 
No.2. 
 
 
                                 SADIQ MAHMUD KHURRAM, J.- This 
election 
appeal has been filed by the Appellant under Section 63 of the Elections Act, 
2017 read with Rule 54 of the Election Rules, 2017 for setting aside the order 
dated 19.03.2023 passed by the Respondent No.1/Returning Officer, 
Constituency PP-259, Rahim Yar Khan -V who rejected the objections filed 
by the Appellant by accepting the nomination papers of the Respondent No.2 
namely Mian Shafi Muhammad. 
2.        Brief facts of the case are that the Election Commission of Pakistan 
called upon the voters of the Constituency PP-259, Rahim Yar Khan -V, to 
elect a Member from the said Constituency  and the schedule of the election 
was announced. Respondent No.2 namely Mian Shafi Muhammad along with 

Election Appeal No.01 of 2023 
2 
 
others filed nomination papers before the returning officer (respondent No.1). 
The appellant namely  Mian Zohaib Aslam Advocate filed written objections 
against the respondent No.2 namely Mian Shafi Muhammad which were 
rejected by the Respondent No.1/Returning Officer, Constituency PP-259, 
Rahim Yar Khan -V  vide order order dated 19.03.2023. 
3.    The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the order dated 
19.03.2023 passed by the Returning Officer, PP-259 Rahim Yar Khan-V, 
accepting the nomination papers of the respondent No.2 namely Mian Shafi 
Muhammad, was liable to be set-aside being against the facts and the law; that 
the respondent No.2 namely Mian Shafi Muhammad claimed to have the 
educational qualification of Bachelor of Arts (B.A) whereas, that degree, 
which the respondent No.2 namely Mian Shafi Muhammad, claims to show 
his educational qualification as Bachelor of Arts (B.A), had been determined 
to be fake by the Election Commission itself vide its order dated 31.10.2013 
and he was also denotified as Member of Provincial Assembly (M.P.A) vide 
order dated 28.01.2015, hence, while submitting his nomination papers, the 
respondent No.2 namely Mian Shafi Muhammad, claiming himself to have 
the qualification as Bachelor of Arts (B.A), using the same degree, rendered 
himself disqualified for being a member of the Provincial Assembly. 
4.               Mr. Muhammad Jaffar, Law Officer, Election Commission of 
Pakistan has submitted the original record and stated that all the objections 
were properly heard by the Respondent No.1 through the mechanism provided 
under the law and the Respondent No.1 had rightly accepted the nomination 
papers of the Respondent No.2 namely Mian Shafi Muhammad. 
5.             Rao Abdul Raheem, Advocate for the Respondent No.2 has 
vehemently opposed this appeal and defended the impugned order by stating 

Election Appeal No.01 of 2023 
3 
 
that the Respondent No.1 had rightly passed the impugned order and had 
rightly accepted the nomination papers of the Respondent No.2 namely Mian 
Shafi Muhammad. 
6.                  Arguments of all the parties have been heard and the available 
record has been perused. 
7.       The objection raised  against the  acceptance of the nomination papers 
of the respondent No.2 was that the respondent No.2 namely Mian Shafi 
Muhammad claimed to have the educational qualification of Bachelor of Arts 
(B.A) whereas, that degree which the respondent No.2 namely Mian Shafi 
Muhammad, claims to show his educational qualification as Bachelor of Arts 
(B.A), had been determined to be fake by the Election Commission itself vide 
its order dated 31.10.2013 and he was also denotified as Member of Provincial 
Assembly (M.P.A) vide order dated 28.01.2015, hence, while submitting his 
nomination papers, the respondent No.2 namely Mian Shafi Muhammad 
claiming himself to have the qualification as Bachelor of Arts (B.A), using 
the same degree, rendered himself disqualified for being a member of the 
Provincial Assembly. For ease of reference, the language of Article 62(1)(f) 
of the Constitution  of the Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan, 1973 is reproduced 
below:- 
  "(f) he is sagacious, righteous, non -profligate, honest and ameen, there being no 
declaration to the contrary by a court of law; " (emphasis supplied)  
A plain reading of the Article makes it abundantly clear that the Constitution 
requires a declaration by a court of law for the candidate to be termed as being 
not sagacious, righteous, non-profligate, honest and ameen.  Facts are that the 
respondent No.2 namely Mian Shafi Muhammad obtained Sanad ul Faragh 
in the year 1995 from Madrassa Qasim ul Uloom Ghotki and as the said 

Election Appeal No.01 of 2023 
4 
 
Madrassa was duly recognized by Shah Abdul Latif University, Khairpur, 
Sindh for the grant of said Sanad by virtue of the Shah Abdul Latif University 
Act, 1986 therefore the respondent No.2 namely Mian Shafi Muhammad was 
issued an Equivalence Certificate from the Shah Abdul Latif University, 
Khairpur, Sindh and on the basis of Sanad ul Faragh, he appeared in the 
annual Bachelor of Arts (B.A) examination conducted by the Shah Abdul 
Latif University Khairpur Sindh in the year 2006 and successfully passed the 
same and the Bachelor of Arts (B.A) degree was conferred upon him by the 
said University in the year 2007. Subsequently, the Election Commission of 
Pakistan, vide its order dated 31.10.2013, observed that prima facie it 
appeared that the respondent No.2 had committed an offence under section 82 
of the Representation of the People Act, 1976 read with other enabling 
provisions of law while using the said degree and was liable to prosecution 
before the Session Judge concerned under section 94(2) of the Representation 
of the People Act, 1976. The Election Commission of Pakistan, transmitted 
the order dated 31.10.2013 to the Provincial Election Commissioner Punjab, 
who was to direct the Regional Election Commissioner/District Election 
Commissioner concerned to lodge a complaint before the Session Judge, 
Rahim Yar Khan. Aggrieved by these measures, the respondent No.2, 
instituted a civil suit before the learned Court of Civil Judge, Islamabad-West 
praying for a declaration that the Bachelor of Arts (B.A) degree conferred 
upon him by the Shah Abdul Latif University, Khairpur, Sindh was genuine. 
The suit as filed by the respondent No.2, was decreed on. 27.07.2015 by the 
learned Civil Judge, Islamabad-West and the appeal lodged by the Election 
Commission of Pakistan was also dismissed by the Additional District Judge, 
Islamabad vide order dated 19.11.2015. However, on 05.07.2019 the Hon'ble 
Islamabad High Court, while deciding the Civil Revision No. 10/2016 titled 

Election Appeal No.01 of 2023 
5 
 
as "Election Commission of Pakistan and another versus Mian Shafi 
Muhammad and others" remanded the matter to the learned Civil Court for 
adjudication of the case on merits. Subsequently, again, the suit filed by the 
respondent No.2 praying for declaration that the Bachelor of Arts (B.A) 
degree conferred upon him by the Shah Abdul Latif University, Khairpur, 
Sindh was genuine was decreed on 01.12.2021 by the learned Civil Judge, 
Islamabad-West . The learned Civil Judge, Islamabad-West declared in his 
judgment dated 01.12.2021, as under:- 
“The case of the plaintiff is he has got equivalence certificate qua Sanad ul Faragh 
being equal to B.A and thereafter in 2006 appeared in B.A Oriental Group exam 
under Shah Abdul Latif University Sindh and finally degree was conferred in 2007 
on the basis of which he contested election of 2008, 2013 and 2018. As admitted 
by DW-1 the competent authority regarding educational affairs is none other than 
HEC whose DG (A&A) got recorded his statement on 08.07.2015 to the effect that 
he has no objection if the suit of the plaintiff' is decreed. As such, inversely the 
collective fall out of statement of DG (A&A) HEC dated 08.07.2015 is that B.A 
Oriental degree of plaintiff is genuine. Had it been not so the fact of degree being 
forged and fabricated would have been clearly and specifically asserted in 
unambiguous terms. However, this is not the case of HEC as per available record.” 
(emphasis supplied)  
The Election Commission of Pakistan has indeed lodged a  Regular First 
Appeal under section 96 read with Order XII Roles 1 and 2 CPC for setting 
aside the judgment and decree dated 01.12.2021 passed by the learned Civil 
Judge, Islamabad-West, however, the said RFA No.47 of 2022 is still pending 
adjudication before the Honourable Islamabad High Court, Islamabad. In this 
manner, the Bachelor of Arts (B.A) degree conferred upon the respondent 
No.2 by the Shah Abdul Latif University, Khairpur, Sindh has been declared 
to be genuine by learned Civil Judge, Islamabad-West and the said judgment 

Election Appeal No.01 of 2023

is still in the field. Therefore, it is abundantly clear that there is no declaration 
by a court of law terming the respondent No.2 as being not sagacious, 
righteous, non-profligate, honest and ameen. The august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the case of Rana AFTAB AHMAD KHAN Versus MUHAMMAD 
AJMAL and another( P L D 2010 Supreme Court 1066) has held as under:- 
“It may be pertinent to mention here that to hold a person lacking honesty, being 
not, Sagacious, righteous, Ameen and non-profligate, in other words is to declare 
him a fraud, cheat and dishonest, etc. which shall be a stigma on his face entailing 
great immense, and innumerable legal and social consequences and repercussions; 
this to our mind shall not be justified without there being an adjudication made 
by the Court of competent jurisdiction to hold him carrying such a "vice". In 
this connection reference can be made to the judgment of this Court reported as Dr. 
Mobashir Hassan and others v. Federation of Pakistan and others (PLD 2010 SC 
265), in which it has been held "if a person involved in corruption and corrupt 
practices has been finally adjudged to be so, then on the basis of such final judgment 
his candidature on the touchstone of Art.62(f) of the Constitution could be adjudged 
to the effect whether he was sagacious, righteous, non-profligate, honest or 
Ameen". This means that the declaration, determination and adjudication of a 
person falling within the mischief of the noted Article by appropriate forum is a 
pre-requisite. Such determination in appropriate cases can also be possible though 
the medium of Returning Officer or the appeal arising therefrom, but it can hardly 
be agreed if it should be straight away done in the Writ Jurisdiction when there is a 
factual controversy involved. We are also not impressed by the submission that the 
Returning Officer should have suo motu rejected the respondent's nomination 
paper, or that in view of the alleged imminent and inherent disqualification the High 
Court should have independently debarred him from contesting the election; 
moreover the reference in this behalf made to paragraph No.21 of the judgment 
declined in C.P. No. 287 of 2008 is misconceived as that direction was restricted to 
the case of Mr. Jamshed Dasti and that too in his case. In the light of the above it is 

Election Appeal No.01 of 2023

held that the Writ Petition of the petitioner was not maintainable.” (emphasis 
supplied) 
Reliance in this regard is also placed on the case of “Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi  
Versus Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, Prime Minister Of Pakistan/Member 
National Assembly, Prime Minister’s House, Islamabad and 9 others” (P L D 
2017 Supreme Court 265) wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan has 
held as under:- 
“20.       The next question emerging for the consideration of this Court is what are 
the fora provided by the Constitution and the law to deal with the questions 
emerging from Articles 62(1)(f) and 63(2) of the Constitution. To answer this 
question we will have to fall back upon Articles 62 and 63 of the Constitution. A 
careful reading of the said Articles would reveal that the one deals with 
qualifications of a person to be elected or chosen as a member of Parliament while 
the other deals with disqualifications of a person not only from being elected or 
chosen but also from being a member of Parliament. If a candidate is not qualified 
or is disqualified from being elected or chosen as a member of Parliament in terms 
of Articles 62 and 63 of the Constitution, his nomination could be rejected by the 
Returning Officer or any other forum functioning in the hierarchy. But where the 
returned candidate was not, on the nomination day, qualified for or disqualified 
from being elected or chosen as a member, his election could be declared void by 
the Election Tribunal constituted under Article 225 of the Constitution. While 
election of a member whose disqualification was overlooked, illegally condoned 
or went unquestioned on the nomination day before the Returning Officer or 
before the Election Tribunal, could still be challenged under Article 199(1)(b)(ii) 
or Article 184(3) of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973 as was held in the cases of 
Lt. Col. Farzand Ali and others v. Province of West Pakistan through the Secretary, 
Department of Agriculture, Government of West Pakistan, Lahore (PLD 1970 SC 
98) and Syed Mehmood Akhtar Naqvi v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary 
Law and others (PLD 2012 SC 1054). However, disqualifications envisaged by 
Article 62(1)(f) and Article 63(2) of the Constitution in view of words used therein 

Election Appeal No.01 of 2023

have to be dealt with differently. In the former case the Returning Officer or any 
other fora in the hierarchy would not reject the nomination of a person from being 
elected as a member of Parliament unless a court of law has given a declaration 
that he is not sagacious, righteous, non-profligate, honest and ameen. Even the 
Election Tribunal, unless it itself proceeds to give the requisite declaration on the 
basis of the material before it, would not disqualify the returned candidate where 
no declaration, as mentioned above, has been given by a court of law. The 
expression “a court of law” has not been defined in Article 62 or any other 
provision of the Constitution but it essentially means a court of plenary 
jurisdiction, which has the power to record evidence and give a declaration 
on the basis of the evidence so recorded. Such a court would include a court 
exercising original, appellate or revisional jurisdiction in civil and criminal 
cases. But in any case a court or a forum lacking plenary jurisdiction cannot decide 
questions of this nature at least when disputed. In the latter case when any question 
arises whether a member of Parliament has become disqualified it shall be dealt 
with only by the Election Commission on a reference from the Speaker of the 
Parliament in terms of Articles 63(2) and 63(3) of the Constitution. (Emphasis 
supplied). We would have sent this case to the Speaker in terms of 63(2) or the 
Election Commission in terms of Article 63(3) of the Constitution but we do not 
think a question of such nature has arisen in this case as respondent No. 1 has been 
alleged to be disqualified even on the nomination day on account of having failed 
to disclose his assets and those of his dependents.” (emphasis supplied)  
 
At this stage, the Tribunal is of the view that if the respondent No.2 is allowed 
to contest the election and even if he succeeds, the appellant would still have 
a remedy to challenge the election by way of an Election petition whereas on 
the other hand, if this appeal is allowed, the respondent No.2 would be ousted 
from the election arena which would be irreparable damage. The wisdom of 
summary inquiry contemplated under the provisions of Election Rules, 2017  
has this rationale behind it.

8. 
In view of above, this appeal holds no merit as the Tribunal does not 
find any illegality or perversity in the impugned order. Therefore, the same is 
hereby dismissed. Notwithstanding anything stated above, it is clarified that 
the findings recorded and observations made herein are based only on a 
tentative assessment of the material before the Tribunal, in the facts and 
circumstances brought to the notice of the Tribunal, for the limited purpose of 
deciding this appeal.
