IN THE LAHORE HIGH COURT, LAHORE 
 
(JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT) 
 
Civil Revision No.2592 of 2014 
Abdul Sattar (deceased) through L.Rs. 
vs. 
        Muhammad Yaseen (deceased) through L.Rs. and 5 others 
 
JUDGMENT 
 
 
 
 
 
MUHAMMAD RAZA QURESHI, J. Through this Civil Revision 
under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (“CPC”), 
the petitioners have invoked supervisory jurisdiction of this Court 
against the judgment and decree dated 28.05.2014 passed by learned 
Additional District Judge, Pattoki, pursuant whereto the judgment 
and decree dated 01.06.2013 passed by the learned Trial Court in a 
suit for possession and specific performance of agreement to 
mortgage/sell was partially upended and accordingly modified by 
holding the petitioners only entitled to recover an amount of 
Rs.300,000/- from the respondents No.1(A to F) along with profit as 
per bank rate. 
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the 
impugned judgment and decree passed by learned Appellate Court is 
illegal and unlawful as the learned Court below misread the evidence 
on record and committed material irregularity by modifying the 
judgment and decree passed by learned Trial Court. According to 
learned counsel, learned Appellate Court without evaluating the 
evidence led by the respective parties and justifying the proposed 
Date of Hearing 
16.05.2024 
Petitioners by: 
Mr. Imran Muhammad Sarwar, Advocate           
Respondents No.1(A to 
F) by: 
Ch. Masood Ahmad Zafar, Advocate 
Respondents No.2 to 6 
Nemo. 

Civil Revision No. 2592 of 2014                                                                                     -2- 
                  
 
 
modification has committed illegality and consequently, the 
impugned judgment and decree is liable to be set aside. 
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondents submits 
that both the judgments and decrees passed by learned Trial Court 
and learned Appellate Court suffer from blatant illegality and learned 
Courts below failed to advert that the predecessor of the petitioners 
being plaintiff could not even prove the subject matter agreement, 
therefore, according to learned counsel, not only the reasoning 
contained in impugned judgment is defective but the one passed by 
learned Trial Court on account of misreading of evidence is also 
jurisdictionally flawed. According to learned counsel, the 
respondents through their Civil Revision bearing No.2660 of 2014 
have also questioned the same judgment and decree. In alternate, 
learned counsel has argued that the modification ordered by learned 
Appellate Court is in the light of evidence led by the respective 
parties, therefore, at maximum the petitioners may recover an 
amount of Rs.300,000/- from the respondents No.1(A to F). The 
record of the case reflects that Respondents No.2 to 6 were 
personally served but nobody is present on their behalf consequently, 
they are proceeded ex parte.   
4. 
Arguments of learned counsel for the parties have been 
heard and record has been perused with their able assistance. At the 
outset, there appears to be fallacy in the arguments agitated by the 
respondents that the impugned judgment and decree has already been 
questioned by the respondents through their independent Civil 
Revision. The copy of order dated 22.03.2019 passed by this Court 
reflects that Civil Revision No.2660 of 2014 filed by the respondents 
already stands dismissed for non-prosecution and to-date no effort 
has been made by them to get the said Petition restored. Therefore, 
the scope and ambit of resolution of controversy remains limited as 
to whether the learned Appellate Court was justified in partially 
upending the judgment and decree dated 01.06.2013 passed by 
learned Trial Court. 

Civil Revision No. 2592 of 2014                                                                                     -3- 
                  
 
 
5. 
The facts culminating into impugned judgment and decree 
emanate from a suit filed by petitioner Abdul Sattar, who died during 
the suit proceedings and consequently his legal heirs were impleaded 
as plaintiffs. The subject matter suit was for possession through 
specific performance of agreement to mortgage/sell, which was filed 
against respondent No.1 Muhammad Yaseen. The contents of plaint 
demonstrate that Abdul Sattar and Muhammad Yaseen were real 
brothers. Muhammad Yaseen was owner of agricultural land 
admeasuring 21-Kanals 13-Marlas in khewat No.63, khatuni Nos.157 
to 162 situated in Chak No.7, Tehsil Pattoki, whose ownership was 
duly reflected in the record of rights for the year 2006-07. Abdul 
Sattar through his suit claimed that Muhammad Yaseen through 
agreement to mortgage bearing No. 966 dated 24.05.2006 (wrongly 
mentioned in the suit as 04.05.2006) mortgaged 1½ Acre of land for 
securing an amount of Rs.300,000/- received from Abdul Sattar for a 
period of 1 year and it was settled between the parties that out of 
total land forming subject matter of mortgage, 06-Kanals would be 
transferred in the name of Abdul Sattar upon additional payment of 
Rs.125,000/- by him. The plaintiff in suit expressed his readiness and 
willingness to pay the amount of Rs.125,000/- and sought specific 
performance of agreement to mortgage/sell. Muhammad Yaseen 
filed written statement by contending that mortgage deed could not 
be converted into agreement to sell and subject matter land was also 
mortgaged with Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan 
(“ADBP”) and since the amount of Rs.125,000/- was not paid by 
Abdul Sattar within stipulated time, therefore, he was debarred to 
seek specific performance of subject matter agreement. Interestingly, 
the contents of written statement though conceded existence and 
contents of subject matter agreement but in its paragraph No.5 
Muhammad Yaseen contended that since Abdul Sattar failed to fulfil 
the conditions, therefore, he never executed any agreement to sell. So 
pleadings reflect contradictory pleas taken by Muhammad Yaseen 
without adverting to the fatal consequence of such defence. 

Civil Revision No. 2592 of 2014                                                                                     -4- 
                  
 
 
6. 
During the pendency of the suit, another suit titled 
“Muhammad Yaseen vs. Abdul Sattar” was filed, which was a suit 
for declaration and cancellation of subject matter agreement. 
Pursuant to order dated 24.06.2009 passed by learned Trial Court, 
both the suits were consolidated and issues were framed therein. The 
order dated 30.10.2009 reflects that issues were re-casted and issue 
No.5-A was framed as an additional issue in the following term: 
“5-A. Whether defendant Muhammad Yasin is entitled 
to get decree for declaration in suit titled Yasin 
vs. Sattar on the ground mentioned in the plaint? 
OPD”  
 
Subsequently, during the course of proceedings, through its orders dated 
17.12.2012 the learned Trial Court on the premise that since property 
was also mortgaged with ADBP, therefore, returned the plaints in both 
the suits to the respective plaintiffs for their presentation before the 
Court of competent jurisdiction constituted under the provisions of the 
Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance, 2001.  
7.          It appears from the record that only Abdul Sattar challenged the 
order dated 17.12.2012 returning his plaint for its presentation before 
the learned Banking Court and Muhammad Yaseen never challenged the 
order passed in his suit and to this extent the order passed in 
Muhammad Yaseen’s suit attained finality. In Abdul Sattar’s appeal the 
learned Appellate Court through order dated 28.02.2013 set aside the 
order passed in suit titled “Abdul Sattar vs. Muhammad Yaseen” and 
upon remand the proceedings re-started in the suit. This order attained 
finality and record also reflects that thereafter Muhammad Yaseen 
stopped pursuing his own suit and the only proceedings before the 
learned Trial Court remained pending adjudication were in the suit titled 
“Abdul Sattar vs. Muhammad Yaseen”.  
8.             This Court through order dated 14.05.2024 summoned the file 
in Civil Revision No.2660 of 2014 and directed the parties to assist on 
the question why the learned Trial Court did not pass the consolidated 
judgment and decree. The record of C.R.No.2660 of 2014 reflects that 

Civil Revision No. 2592 of 2014                                                                                     -5- 
                  
 
 
same got dismissed for non-prosecution through order dated 22.03.2019 
and no effort was ever made by Muhammad Yaseen to get it restored 
and on his behalf only the impugned judgment and decree was 
challenged. Although one of the grounds to challenge the impugned 
judgment and decree was mentioned as non-determination of 
consolidated issue No.5-A but the record justifies that upon remand of 
matter through order dated 28.02.2013 the proceedings were no more 
treated as consolidated as order returning the plaint in the suit titled 
“Muhammad Yaseen vs. Abdul Sattar” was never questioned by 
Muhammad Yaseen and the proceedings were no more consolidated  as 
before the learned Trial Court only one suit titled “Abdul Sattar vs. 
Muhammad Yaseen” remained pending. 
9. 
Although in exercise of supervisory jurisdiction, this Court has 
identified that learned Trial Court while passing the judgment and 
decree did not discuss these aspects but since the status of respective 
litigations stood clarified upon perusal of record, therefore, the defect to 
the extent of non-adjudication of issue No.5-A stands clarified and 
cured as the said issue had become redundant. Therefore, to this extent 
the judgment and decree passed by the learned Trial Court cannot be 
questioned by the respondent Muhammad Yaseen. 
10. 
Now adverting to the merits of the case to identify whether 
modification ordered by learned Appellate Court was justified? The 
perusal of pleadings as well as evidence on record reflects that most 
crucial issues were issues No.1 and 2. The onus to prove issue No.1 i.e.  
“whether the defendant entered into agreement to mortgage as well as 
sell dated 24.05.2006 (wrongly mentioned as 04.05.2006) with the 
plaintiff and received an amount of Rs.300,000/- as earnest money” was 
placed upon Abdul Sattar, whereas the onus to prove issue No.2 i.e. 
“whether the alleged agreement to mortgage as well as sell dated 
24.05.2006 is void, against the law and facts and liable to be set aside” 
was placed upon defendant Muhammad Yaseen.  

Civil Revision No. 2592 of 2014                                                                                     -6- 
                  
 
 
11. 
The subject matter agreement to mortgage/sell bearing No. 966 
dated 24.05.2006 was adduced in evidence as Exh-P1 and PW-1 
Basheeri Bibi widow of Abdul Sattar deposed that her husband affixed 
his thumb impression on Exh-P1 and paid the secured amount of 
Rs.300,000/- to Muhammad Yaseen for the subject matter land, who 
had mortgaged the property and after perusing the terms and conditions 
of subject matter agreement it was agreed between the parties that in 
case Muhammad Yaseen failed to repay the mortgage money after one 
year, the land admeasuring 1½ acre was to remain in possession of 
Abdul Sattar who upon payment of an additional amount of 
Rs.125,000/- was entitled to get 6-Kanals land transferred in his name. 
PW-1 deposed in her evidence about the stamp vendor, namely, Abdul 
Rehman as well as Muhammad Ishaq and Muhammad Aslam as the 
marginal witnesses. Abdul Rehman, stamp vendor appeared in the 
witness-box as PW-2, whereas Muhammad Ishaq, one of the marginal 
witnesses appeared as PW-3. The examination of depositions of both the 
witnesses reflect that they corroborated the evidence of PW-1. All the 
witnesses appearing on behalf of the plaintiff categorically and 
consistently deposed about the execution of subject matter agreement, 
acknowledged the contents thereof and corroborated about the payment 
of an amount of Rs.300,000/- by Abdul Sattar to Muhammad Yaseen.  
12. 
In defence, Muhammad Yaseen himself appeared in the witness-
box as DW-1 and conceded the execution of Exh-P1 but termed it as 
mortgage deed and deposed that it was never meant to be used as 
agreement to sell. For ready reference the cross-examination of DW-1 
Muhammad Yaseen is reproduced hereunder:

13. 
Incidentally, Muhammad Aslam (DW-2) the second marginal 
witness of subject matter agreement appeared on behalf of Muhammad 
Yaseen who admitted that agreement (Exh-P1) was executed in his 
presence and he recognized his signatures as Exh-P1/6 in the following 
terms: 
 
رار ن اہم

ایبن ایک ہک اقExP1 ریمے اسےنم وہا اھت۔ ںیم ےن Exh-P1/6دطختس ےیک------

However, his deposition was adverse to the interests of Abdul Sattar 
only to the extent that no transaction of amount took place in his 
presence. He conceded in his deposition that both the brothers Abdul 
Sattar and Muhammad Yaseen throughout enjoyed cordial relations with 
each other. The statement of Muhammad Aslam (DW-2) to the extent of 
payment of Rs.300,000/- is shady, unreliable and not creditworthy  as in 
his own evidence Muhammad Yaseen had conceded about the payment 
of Rs.300,000/-. The witness DW-2 callously and evasively deposed 
that he was not aware of the terms and conditions with respect to the 
payment of Rs.125,000/- and transfer of 6-Kanals land in lieu thereof. 
The statement of DW-2 has not been considered trustworthy because 
under the law if there is contradiction in oral statement and documentary 
evidence the latter is to be trusted as a witness can lie but a document 
cannot. It becomes more credible when witness himself admits his 
signature or thumb impression on the subject matter document i.e. 
Exh.P-1. In such circumstances it is settled law that documentary 
evidence takes precedence over oral deposition. Reliance in this regard 
is placed upon judgments reported as Muhammad Mumtaz Shah 
(deceased) through LRs. and others vs. Ghulam Hussain Shah 
(deceased) through LRs. and others (2023 SCMR 1155), Tassaduq 
Hussain Shah and others vs. Allah Ditta Shah and others (2023 SCMR 
1635), Muhammad Akbar and  others vs. Province of Punjab through 
DOR, Lodhran and others (2022 SCMR 1532) and Shamshad vs. Arif 
Ashraf Khan and others (2010 SCMR 473).   

Civil Revision No. 2592 of 2014                                                                                     -8- 
                  
 
 
14. 
The perusal of evidence led by respective parties established that 
not only the existence of subject matter agreement stood admitted and 
proved as stamp vendor (PW-2), marginal witnesses, namely, 
Muhammad Ishaq (PW-3) and Muhammad Aslam (DW-2) conceded its 
execution but the contents thereof also stood established during the 
course of evidence. All these facts were duly accounted for by the 
judgment and decree passed by learned Trial Court who lawfully 
appreciated the oral as well as documentary evidence and decided issue 
No.1 in favour of plaintiff Abdul Sattar and rightly declared that 
defendant Muhammad Yaseen failed to prove issue No.2. Consequently 
through judgment and decree dated 01.06.2013 passed a decree in 
favour of legal heirs of Abdul Sattar who died during the course of 
proceedings and directed his legal heirs to pay the remaining sale 
consideration in the sum of Rs.125,000/- within a period of one month 
from passing of the judgment and decree. The parties before this Court 
conceded that said amount was deposited on behalf of the petitioner 
Abdul Sattar within the time stipulated by the learned Trial Court. 
15. 
Incidentally, upon appeal filed by Muhammad Yaseen the 
learned Appellate Court though admitted the transaction and payment of  
amount by holding that it stood proved yet declared that since the 
property was mortgaged with ADBP, therefore, no  transaction with the 
nature of agreement to sell could have taken place and ultimately 
learned Appellate Court held that agreement to mortgage/sell Exh-P1 
shall be enforced in the manner that the amount of Rs.300,000/- shall be 
paid along with bank profit by Muhammad Yaseen to legal heirs of 
Abdul Sattar and that is why the appeal filed by Muhammad Yaseen 
was partially allowed. 
16. 
The reasoning and findings contained in the impugned judgment 
and decree appear to be self-contradictory, shady and meaningless and 
justification adopted by learned Appellate Court appears to be full of 
fallacy and beyond any legal sense. The learned Appellate Court dealt 
with the matter in a sketchy manner even without discussing the 
evidence and merits of the case. The conclusions drawn in paragraph 

Civil Revision No. 2592 of 2014                                                                                     -9- 
                  
 
 
No.7 of the impugned judgment dated 28.05.2014 are contrary to law, 
bereft of any logic, reasoning and discussion of evidence in detail and 
hence suffer from material illegality. The findings with respect to 
recovery of Rs.300,000/- were irrelevant as the subject matter suit did 
not even pertain to this limited question. The core question was whether 
Abdul Sattar upon payment of Rs.125,000/- was entitled to get 6-Kanals 
land transferred in his favour?  
17 
Even otherwise under the provisions of the Transfer of Property 
Act, 1877, the transaction with respect to mortgaged property in favour 
of any financial institution does not become void as the mortgage rights 
of a financial institution remain intact and the transferee of the property 
remains under an obligation to pay the mortgage money to the creditor. 
Therefore, the findings of the learned Appellate Court that since 
ADBP’s stance is not available, therefore, the subject matter agreement 
could not have been executed and suit cannot be decreed are contrary to 
law. Reliance in this respect is placed upon the judgments reported as 
Citibank N.A. through Manager vs. Muhammad Akbar and 3 others 
(2005 CLD 384),Muhammad  Sadiq and others vs. Muhammad Mansha 
and others (PLD 2018 SC 692) and Mst. Saima Naeem vs. Habib Bank 
Limited through Manager/Officer/Attorney and another (2023 CLD 
1244). In paragraph 6 of the report under title of Muhammad Sadiq case 
supra the Hon’ble Supreme Court clearly declared the position of law as 
under:- 
“6. In our view, law that was regarded as settled 125 years ago 
can hardly be disturbed today. As will be seen from the foregoing 
passages, the equity of redemption is simply the interest in the 
property that remains with the mortgager minus the interest 
created thereon in favour of the mortgagee, and it is in this 
interest that can be dealt with by the mortgager in accordance 
with law. It follows from this that if the mortgager enters into an 
agreement to sell subsequent to the creation of the mortgage, he 
can do so. He is then selling his property burdened as it is with 
the mortgage in favour of the mortgagee, i.e., he is disposing off 
the equity of redemption. As this is permissible under law, it 
follows that if the mortgager having entered into such an 
agreement to sell does not abide by the same, then the buyer of 
the property is entitled to bring a suit for specific performance. Of 
course, the rights and interests of the mortgagee will not be 
defeated, since the buyer will step into the shoes of the mortgager 
as seller. If the factum of the mortgage is known to the buyer then 
he can simply join the mortgagee as a defendant in the suit so that 

Civil Revision No. 2592 of 2014                                                                                     -10- 
                  
 
 
if he succeeds in obtaining a decree for specific performance the 
rights of the various parties can be appropriately dealt with. 
However, even if the factum of mortgage is unknown to the buyer 
and does not come to light during the course of the suit, any 
decree obtained by the buyer would still, and nonetheless, remain 
subject to the rights and interests of the mortgagee.” 
18. 
The learned Trial Court had rightly arrived at a conclusion that 
existence as well as contents of subject matter agreement stood proved, 
the contrary conclusion arrived at by the learned Appellate Court is not 
only illegal due to misreading of evidence but also suffers from serious 
material irregularity as the judgment and decree passed by the learned 
Trial Court could not have been reversed or modified under settled 
principles of law. The impugned judgment and decree passed by the 
learned Appellate Court appears to be sketchy and without any 
evaluation of evidentiary material and substantiation of settled principle 
of law and it appears that the learned Appellate Court evaluated the 
merits of the case in a slipshod manner. In legal parlance, any verdict or 
judgment without containing justified reasoning to set aside the 
judgment and decree passed by the learned trial court cannot sustain in 
the eyes of law. There could be no denial to legal position that appellate 
Court can competently reverse the findings of the trial Court but such 
reversal must always be backed by better and sustainable legal 
reasoning. The appellate Court evolved findings arbitrarily and illegally 
on imaginary principles and exercised its jurisdiction unlawfully 
suffering from material irregularities and therefore, same are not 
sustainable in the eyes of law. Reliance in this respect is placed upon the 
judgments reported as Madan Gopal and 4 others vs.Maran Bepari and 
3 others (PLD 1969 SC 617), Raja Hamayun Sarfraz Khan and others 
vs. Noor Muhammad (2007 SCMR 307) and Abdul Jabbar and 8 others 
vs. Ghulam Mustafa and 6 others (2019 CLC 704). 
19. 
Although respondents No.2 to 6 have been proceeded ex parte 
but here it is imperative to analyze status of their rights in the subject 
matter property. Upon institution of instant Petition this Court through 
order dated 19.08.2014 passed an injunctive order in C.M.No.1-C of 
2014 directing respondent No.1 that suit property would not be alienated 

Civil Revision No. 2592 of 2014                                                                                     -11- 
                  
 
 
to a third person. Despite the existence of afore-referred injunctive 
order, the legal heirs of respondent No.1 had audacity to transact the 
subject matter property by selling the same to respondents No.2 to 6 
through registered sale deeds bearing Nos.873, 874 and 875 all dated 
30.03.2016. Upon attaining knowledge the petitioners forthwith filed an 
application bearing C.M.No.2-C of 2016 seeking their impleadment as 
respondents. Pursuant to order dated 14.06.2016 the respondents No.2 to 
6 were ordered to be impleaded as respondents. 
20. 
It appears that legal heirs of respondent No.1 willfully 
disregarded the order of this Court tending to alter the position and 
status of the property in a judicial dispute and recklessly and wantonly 
changed the status of the property while the application for interim relief 
had received active consideration of this Court. Such manipulated 
intervention through act of commission has never been brooked by the 
courts. A party attempting to act in anticipation of the final order or 
judgment of a court or trying to steal march over its adversary, already 
in court or acting in a manner suggestive of a race against the law is 
liable to correction and all that needed to be considered is the corrective 
measures to uphold and maintain the majesty of law. Reliance in this 
regard is placed upon Saif ur Rehman vs. Muhammad Ayub and 2 others 
(1998 CLC 1872). 
21. 
Obviously, when the suit was filed the subject matter controversy 
was limited to the rights and interests of Abdul Sattar and Muhammad 
Yaseen. The Court of first instance conditionally decreed the suit in 
favour of Abdul Sattar. The learned Appellate Court below modified the 
said judgment and decree and matter appeared before this Court in 
exercise of supervisory jurisdiction. Till then respondents No.2 to 6 had 
not purchased the subject matter property and same took place only 
during the pendency of instant Revision Petition. The sale in their  
favour  was, clearly  hit  by  the doctrine of lis pendens which finds 
legislative  recognition  in  section  52  of  the  Transfer of Property Act, 
1882. The  respondents No.2 to 6 cannot use the shield  of  bona fide

proceedings and that principle of lis pendens has no applicability in their 
case. 
22. 
The principle of lis pendens has its genesis in maxim “ut lite 
pendente nihil innovetur” (during a litigation nothing new should be 
introduced). Therefore, whether respondents No.2 to 6 had knowledge 
of litigation inter se Abdul Sattar and Muhammad Yaseen or not is 
immaterial. So long as the sale of property forming subject matter of 
instant Petition is made pendente lite which includes stages of suit 
proceedings, appeal, revision petition and/or final adjudication of rights 
and interests of a party by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan 
finally terminating the lis in either way, the principle of lis pendens 
applies regardless of the plea of bona fide purchasers, especially when 
an injunctive order was operative in the Petition. The Hon’ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in case reported as Industrial Development Bank of 
Pakistan through Deputy Chief Manager vs. Saadi Asmatullah and 
others (1999 SCMR 2874) has already declared that plea of bona fide 
purchaser of suit property for value without notice does not offset or 
dilute  the principle of lis pendens by holding that even a bona fide 
purchaser with consideration pendente lite would be bound by the result 
of the litigation as his rights in such property would be subject to the 
rights of the parties to the litigation as  finally determined by the Court. 
23. 
The alienation or transfer pendente lite is not simpliciter based 
upon the principle that filing of a suit is notice to whole world but more 
so on the public policy that no one should be allowed to affect the rights 
of the parties pending the decision of cause before a Court of law. It is 
useful to refer to Beliamy v. Shabine (1857) 1 De G. and J 566 in which 
the rationale on which the doctrine of lis pendens rests was propounded 
by Turner L.J. in the following words:- 
“It is as I think, a doctrine common to the Courts both of Law and 
Equity and rests, as I apprehend, upon this foundation---that it 
would plainly be impossible that any action or suit could be 
brought to a successful termination, if alienations pendente lite 
were permitted to prevail, the plaintiff would be liable in every 
case to be defeated by the defendant’s alienating before the 
judgment or decree, and would be driven to commence his 

Civil Revision No. 2592 of 2014                                                                                     -13- 
                  
 
 
proceedings de novo, subject again to be defeated by the same 
course of proceeding.”  
In the same semblance Lord Cranworth explained that the doctrine did 
not rest on the ground of notice and observed that: 
“It is scarcely correct to speak of lis pendens as affecting a 
purchaser through the doctrine of notice, though undoubtedly the 
language of the Courts often so describes its operation. It affects 
him not because it amounts to noticed, but because the law does 
not allow litigant parties to give to others, pending the litigation, 
rights to the property in dispute, so as to prejudice the opposite-
party. ”  
24. 
The respondents No.2 to 6 purchased the property in dispute 
from legal heirs of Muhammad Yaseen during the pendency of instant 
Petition. Hence, for all intent and purposes by getting the property 
transferred in their favour during pendency of instant Petition, the 
respondents No.2 to 6 have stepped into the shoes of legal heirs of 
Muhammad Yaseen and the subject matter agreement will be 
specifically enforced in favour of the petitioners against them in terms 
of section 29(b) of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 which ordains that not 
only the parties to agreement but also their successors are bound by it. 
The only exception in this behalf is that of bona fide purchaser for value 
without notice on any existing agreement. It is a settled position of law 
that in case of conflict of two principles ‘bona fide purchaser’ versus 
‘lis pendens’ the latter is to prevail. Therefore, the respondents No.2 to 6 
cannot use the shield of bona fide purchasers as they admittedly 
purchased the subject matter property during pendency of the instant 
Petition and being successors of legal heirs of Muhammad Yaseen are 
bound to convey the property to the petitioners. Reliance in this regard 
is placed upon judgments reported as Abdus Saeed Khan and 2 others 
vs. Basharat Ali and 13 others (PLD 1995 Lahore 255) and Ms.Sara 
Bibi vs. Muhammad Saleem and others (PLD 2021 Islamabad 236). 
 
25. 
Therefore, respondents No.2 to 6 to the extent of their claim 
having same status of the legal heirs of Muhammad Yaseen being 
successors-in-interest would sail and sink along with legal heirs of 
Muhammad Yaseen.

26. 
Having analyzed the lis from all aspects with consultation of 
lower Court record and after minute evaluation of evidence led by the 
respective parties, this Court holds that the impugned judgment and 
decree dated 28.05.2014 passed by the learned Appellate Court is not 
sustainable in the eyes of law and the judgment and decree passed by 
the learned Trial Court is declared to be lawful, weighty and 
creditworthy. As a consequence thereof, this Civil Revision is allowed, 
the impugned judgment and decree dated 28.05.2014 passed by the 
learned Appellate Court is set aside and suit filed by the petitioners is 
decreed in terms of judgment and decree dated 01.06.2013 passed by 
learned Trial Court. There is no order as to costs.
