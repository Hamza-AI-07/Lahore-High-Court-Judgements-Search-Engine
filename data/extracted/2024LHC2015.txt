JUDGMENT 
 
Date of hearing 
 
05.12.2023  
 
Petitioner by 
 
Mr. 
Khurshid 
Anwar 
Bhindar, 
learned Advocate. 
Respondents by 
Ch. Farid-ul-Hassan, learned Special 
Prosecutor NAB. 
 
SULTAN TANVIR AHMAD, J:– Through this petition, 
filed under Article 199 of the Constitution of  Islamic  
Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the petitioner has challenged order 
of 
restriction 
bearing 
No. 
1(9)/HQ/535/NAB-P(IW-ii)        
dated 08.10.2007 passed National Accountability Ordinance, 
1999 (the ‘Ordinance’), with respect to property measuring 
41-kanals 
05-marlas 
situated 
in 
Mouza 
Suhadara,             
Tehsil Wazirabad, (Gujranwala) commonly known as     
Ayesha Rice Mills (the ‘Property’) as well as the act of  
placing the property under caution and order dated   
23.12.2019 to include the property in the list of confiscated 

W.P No. 5915 of 2020 
 
 
2 
assets  for the recovery of fine of Rs. 1286 Million, in terms of 
section 33-E of the Ordinance, as arrears of land revenue in 
connection with case No. 20/2006 titled State vs. Zaheer 
Abbas Ghumman & others.  
2.  
Brief facts, required for reaching to decision of 
the case, are that Syed Sibt-ul-Hassan Gillani alias Double 
Shah was found to be involved in receiving investment from 
people of the area with promise to double the investments in 
short span of time. Reference was filed against Double Shah 
before the learned National Accountability Court, Lahore (the 
‘Accountability Court’). During the course of inquiry against 
Double Shah, Zaheer Abbas Ghumman and others were 
investigated and after due probe a reference No. 17/2009 was 
also instituted against them. Zaheer Abbas Ghumman, Javed 
Iqbal and Syed Moazzam Hussain Gillani requested for their 
plea bargain for an amount of Rs. 1286 Million, which was 
accepted by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB). 
Zaheer Abbas Ghumman and others made confession before 
the learned Accountability Court on 13.04.2012. Consequently, 
the learned Accountability Court convicted Zaheer Abbas 
Ghumman and others and proceeded to pass the sentence in the 
following manners:- 
 
“They committed offence of corruption and 
corrupt practices as defined in section 9 (a)(iii)(iv) 
(ix) and (xii) and punishable u/s 10 (a) of NAO 1999. 
All the accused are first offenders. They involved 

W.P No. 5915 of 2020 
 
 
3 
themselves to work as agent of Double Shah due to 
greediness. They are sole bread earners of their 
families. They voluntarily confessed their guilt and 
put themselves on mercy of the court. They are behind 
the bar since 26-05-2009. These are mitigating 
circumstances, to deal the accused with leniency. 
They are convicted u/s 10 (a) of NAO 1999 and 
sentenced to six (6) years rigorous Imprisonment each 
which is sufficient to meet the ends of justice. They 
shall also be pay to the tune of Rs.1286 million 
subject to adjustment of amounts paid to, collected or 
recovered by NAB in the terms of cash bank accounts 
moveable and immoveable assets mentioned at pages 
9, 10, 11, 13, 14 and 15 of the investigation report. In 
case of failure in payments of fine, they shall have to 
under go six (06) months simple imprisonment. The 
amount of fine shall be recoverable as arrears of land 
revenue as envisaged u/s 33-E of NAO 1999. All the 
assets, amount and bank accounts in the names of the 
accused and obtained by the accused in the name of 
their benamidars/beneficiaries shall be confiscated in 
favour of the state.” 
 
 
3. 
As per the allegations of the prosecution against 
the petitioner as well as orders assailed, one Haq Nawaz who is 
brother of Zaheer Abbas Ghumman-convict paid Rs. 17.5 
Million (rupees seventeen million five hundred thousand only) 
to the petitioner on 13.03.2007 as token money for the 
purchase of the property and the petitioner is holding the 
property as benamidar of Haq Nawaz. Aggrieved from the said 
allegations and above mentioned orders the present petition has 
been instituted. 
4. 
Mr. Khurshid Anwar Bhindar, learned counsel for 
the petitioner, has submitted that the allegations against the 
petitioner are uncertain and formless; that the petitioner is real 
owner in possession of the property who purchased the same in 
the year 1995; that the petitioner is also holding title 

W.P No. 5915 of 2020 
 
 
4 
documents of the property in the shape of sale deed registered 
in his favour on 14.09.1999 with Sub-Registrar of Wazirabad 
(the ‘sale deed’); that the petitioner, having no idea as to any 
case against Zaheer Abbas Ghumman-convict and in good 
faith, entered into an agreement to sell the property dated 
13.03.2007 (the ‘agreement’) with Haq Nawaz. It is further 
submitted that Haq Nawaz merely paid earnest money and then 
breached 
the 
agreement; 
consequently, 
the 
petitioner 
approached the learned Civil Court concerned and obtained 
decree dated 25.03.2010 to the effect of forfeiture of earnest 
money on account of default by Haq Nawaz. Learned counsel 
for the petitioner has relied upon cases titled “Eden 
Developers Ltd. vs. NAB and other” (PLD 2011 Lahore 48), 
“Ghani-ur-Rehman vs. National Accountability Bureau and 
others” (PLD 2011 SC 1144), “Ghulam Basit vs. The State 
and another” (2013 PCR.LJ 1797), “Saad Sumair vs. 
National Accountability Bureau (NAB) through Chairman and 
2 others” (PLD 2022 Islamabad 371), “Mst. Bilqis Bano and 
another vs. Pakistan Defence Officers Housing Authority 
through Administrator and 4 others” (2019 PCR.LJ 962) and 
“Syed Azmat Hussain vs. Chairman, NAB and others” (2011 
PCR.LJ 104) and he has contended that the petitioner is 
neither an accused in any of the reference emanating out of the 
Double Shah scam nor he is ever called as witness, thus, 
confiscating the property is in utter violation of the principles 

W.P No. 5915 of 2020 
 
 
5 
settled in the said cases; that the petitioner or the property has 
no nexus with the alleged crime or the proceeds of the crime. 
The learned counsel, without prejudice to the above, has stated 
that even if Haq Nawaz is found to have been dealing with the 
proceeds of the crime, the petitioner is lawful owner in the 
possession of the property from 1995 and the agreement in 
favour of Haq Nawaz since has been cancelled on account of 
his failure to pay consideration and he never acquired any 
ownership right or interest in the property, thus, the same 
cannot be sold to satisfy any claim or payment of fine. 
5. 
Conversely, learned Special Prosecutor of NAB 
has argued that huge amount is involved in the case and Rs. 
682 Million has already been recovered from different 
benamidars. The remaining amount is yet to be recovered by  
the sale of confiscated assets including the property; that as a 
matter of fact it was Zaheer Abbas Ghumman-convict, who 
paid Rs. 17.5 Million as token to the petitioner through Haq 
Nawaz, his brother, as a benamidar. He has further submitted 
that the orders and the actions impugned, in this petition, are in 
accordance with law.  
6. 
We have heard the arguments and perused the 
documents with the able assistance of the learned counsel for 
the parties.  
7. 
The prosecution has not denied before us that the  

W.P No. 5915 of 2020 
 
 
6 
petitioner is not an accused in any of references filed by NAB 
in the matters arising out of Double Shah scam. It is further 
confirmed that the petitioner was never produced or summoned 
by the learned Accountability Court as a witness. Admittedly, 
the petitioner is never examined by any forum, judicial or even 
investigation agency, in connection with the property or 
receiving proceeds of crime. The definition of benamidar 
given in the Ordinance, as applicable at the material time, is as 
follows:- 
 
           Section 5(da). 
“benamidar” means any person who 
ostensibly holds or is in possession or 
custody of any property of an accused on 
his behalf for the benefit and enjoyment of 
the accused.  
(Underlining is added) 
 
A bare perusal of the definition of word benamidar given in the 
reproduced provision of the Ordinance, reflects that one can be 
said to be a benamidar only when he ostensibly holds or is in 
possession or has custody of some property which actually 
belongs to the accused of an offence punishable under the 
Ordinance or if it is meant for the benefit and enjoyment of the 
accused.  
Benami transaction or benamidar is also mentioned in section 
9(v) of the Ordinance which, at the relevant time, was as 
under:-  

W.P No. 5915 of 2020 
 
 
7 
 
          Section 9(v) 
“If he or any of his dependents or 
benamidar 
owns, 
possesses, 
or 
has 
[acquired] right or title in any assets or 
holds irrevocable power of attorney in 
respect of any 
assets 
or pecuniary 
resources disproportionate to his known 
sources of income, which he cannot 
reasonably account for or maintains a 
standard of living beyond that which is 
commensurate with his sources of income; 
or … 
(Underlining is added) 
 
 
8.  
Reading of section 9(v) of the Ordinance further 
confirms that before holding someone as benamidar of illegal 
asset it is necessary that the person is given a chance to 
reasonably account for the asset in question or if he maintains 
standard of living beyond his means or if the asset does not 
commensurate with his sources. It is not argued by the 
representatives of NAB before us that the petitioner was ever 
asked to account for the property or the petitioner is holding 
the property beyond his means. The Honourable Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in case titled “Mst. Zahida Sattar and others 
vs. Federation of Pakistan and others” (PLD 2002 SC 408) 
observed that in the cases under progress for accumulation of 
wealth by illegal or corrupt practices, if dispute arises between 
the one claiming to be the real owner (not being accused 
himself) and on the other hand the alleged ostensible owner i.e. 
benamidar then such dispute being civil in nature can be 
resolved by the learned Civil Court under Section 9 of the 

W.P No. 5915 of 2020 
 
 
8 
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. It will be beneficial to 
reproduce the following extract from said judgment:- 
“12. The question arises whether a Civil Court is 
vested with the jurisdiction to entertain a suit to 
try an issue which is subject-matter of a criminal 
charge for which an accused is being tried in a 
Criminal Court under special law i.e. NAB 
Ordinance. The answer to this question revolves 
around the decision on the question whether the 
Civil Court can try a criminal charge which is 
exclusively triable by a criminal Court under the 
special law. The answer cannot be but in the 
negative. If it had been a dispute between the 
real owner and the ostensible owners who were 
alleged to be the benamidars arising from denial 
of latter's right for former, certainly it would 
have been a dispute of civil nature and only the 
Civil Court could take cognizance of the same 
under section 9, C.P.C. which provides that a 
Civil Court shall (subject to the provisions herein 
contained) have jurisdiction to try all suits of civil 
nature except the suits of which their cognizance 
is either expressly or impliedly barred.” 
 
 
(Emphases supplied) 
 
9.  
In the aforesaid case the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan also recommended the Federal Government to 
consider making suitable amendments in the Ordinance, 
ensuring that the alleged ostensible owners are summoned by 
the learned Accountability Courts to provide them opportunity, 
during the trial, to prove that the assets in question were 
acquired by them through their own resources and if it is 
decided that the allegations are correct, they should be 
provided with remedy of appeal to advance the needs of 
justice.

10. 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan in case titled 
“Iqbal Ahmed Turabi and others vs. The State” (PLD 2004 
SC 830) examined the question involving benami transaction 
in a NAB matter and observed that in the situation when the 
dispute arises between third party on the one side and the real 
owner and the benamidar on the other, conduct of the parties 
and surrounding circumstances are to be taken into 
consideration to determine as to whether the questioned 
transaction was a benami or not. The relevant part of the 
judgment reads as follows:- 
 
“The premises was taken from petitioner 
Iqbal Ahmad Turabi but the tenancy agreement 
was executed in which petitioner Hassan Raza 
was shown as landlord. In the beginning the rent 
was being collected by petitioner Iqbal Ahmad 
Turbai but after few months petitioner Hassan 
Raza started collecting the rent. From the above 
evidence, it is clear that the letting out of the 
premises to Khalid Hussain has not been denied 
by any of the petitioners. It is pertinent to point 
out that in benami transaction, from whom the 
consideration money came and from whom the 
document of sale are produced in Court plays a 
dominant roll when the dispute is between the real 
owner and the benamidar. If the dispute is 
between the third party on the one hand and the 
real owner and the benamidar on the other hand 
then the above-mentioned consideration looses its 
importance. In such situation the conduct of the 
parties and the surrounding circumstances are to 
be taken into consideration to determine, whether 
the transaction was a benami transaction or not. 
It is no doubt true that the source of consideration 
money and the possession of the titled documents 
are essential elements to determine the nature of 
the transaction where the dispute arises in 
between benami and the real owner.”

11.  
 
Section 12(a) of the Ordinance, which permits 
NAB authorities or the learned National Accountability Court 
to pass an order of freezing of any property or part thereof in 
possession of the accused or in possession of any relative or 
associated person, itself is dependent upon availability of 
reasonable grounds. A learned Division Bench of Islamabad 
High Court in case titled “Shah Rukh Jamal Versus National 
Accountability Bureau, Islamabad and Others” (PLD 2022 
Islamabad 1), while examining section 12, 13 and 23 of the 
Ordinance, reached to the conclusion that reasonable grounds 
as contemplated in the section 12 of the Ordinance, requires 
existence of certain essential facts. The test settled is that the 
facts and circumstances should be so that it lead a reasonable 
prudent person to form belief that a property, directly or 
indirectly, is owned and controlled by an accused under the 
Ordinance. The requisite standard, to pass an order under 
section 12 of the Ordinance, is fixed as more than mere 
suspicion but less than on the balance of probabilities. It has 
also been concluded that the power to freeze one’s property is 
subject to judicial scrutiny. It will be well advantageous to 
reproduce paragraphs No. 13 to 15 of the said judgment:- 
 
“13. The august Supreme Court in the case titled 
“Chaudhry Shujat Husain v. The State” [1995 SCMR  
 
 

W.P No. 5915 of 2020 
 
 
11 
1249] has observed and held as follows:- 
“The term “reason to believe” can be 
classified at a higher padestal than 
mere suspicion and allegation but not 
equivalent to proved evidence. Even 
the 
strongest 
suspicion 
cannot 
transform in “reason to believe.” In 
Nisar Ahmad’s case the criteria laid 
down seems to be that where some 
tangible evidence is available against 
the accused which, if left unrebutted, 
may lead to the inference of guilt.”    
14. 
It is obvious from the above discussed 
precedent law that having ‘reasonable grounds to 
believe’ has reference to the required evidentiary 
threshold. It is a legal standard and it has to be met 
as a precondition before exercising the intrusive 
power under section 12 of the Ordinance of 1999. 
There 
must 
be 
‘reasonable 
grounds’ 
which 
manifests existence of certain essential facts. It 
essentially refers to the existence of such facts and 
circumstances which would lead a reasonable 
prudent person to form a belief. In the context of 
section 12 such belief would be relatable to the 
property being, directly or indirectly, owned and 
controlled by an accused and the latter having 
committed one of the offences described under 
section 9 of the Ordinance of 1999. The requisite 
standard is higher than a reasonable suspicion but 
less than ‘on balance of probabilities’. It is distinct 
from conjecture, speculation or suspicion. The 
required standard is far less than proving something 
beyond a reasonable doubt. It is a threshold required 
for a reasonable person to conclude and be satisfied 
on the basis of sufficient material to conclude 
deprivation of or interference with the right to own, 
hold or control a property. The conclusion may be 
subjective but it must be based on some reliable 
material or evidence. The formation cannot be based 
on mere suspicion even if it may be reasonable. In a 
nutshell, forming an opinion On the basis of 
reasonable grounds to believe is distinct and a higher 
legal standard than ‘reasonable suspicion’. 
15.  
There is another distinctive factor of the 
scheme regarding the intrusive power provided under 
section 12. The power is subject to judicial scrutiny 
explicitly described under section 13. While the 
claim or objection is exclusively justifiable by the 
Accountability Court, a statutory right of appeal lies 
to a High Court. Moreover, even if no order has been 
passed under section 12, there is a statutory 

W.P No. 5915 of 2020 
 
 
12 
prohibition under section 23 to deal with a property 
connected with one of the offences described under 
section 9 of the Ordinance of 1999. The special 
scheme provided under sections 12, 13 and 23 of the 
Ordinance of 1999 to deal with a property owned or 
controlled by an accused and connected with the 
offence allegedly committed by the latter is distinct 
from the powers under Cr.P.C.”  
 
(Emphases supplied) 
 
12.  
 
Reverting to the facts of the case. It is the claim of 
the petitioner that he is in possession of the property since 
1995 and he had been running his business on the property in 
name of ‘Ayesha Rice Mill’. The original ownership of the 
petitioner from 1990s and the title document i.e. the sale deed 
is not denied. Haq Nawaz, the brother of the Zaheer Abbas 
Ghumman-convict, entered into the agreement and paid earnest 
money. This agreement is in conformity with article 17 of the 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. The learned special prosecutor 
of NAB has not argued that Haq Nawaz ever paid the balance 
consideration. The learned prosecutor, when confronted as to 
the aspect of balance consideration, has candidly conceded that 
there is nothing on record showing such payment. The decree 
dated 25.03.2010 was granted in favour of the petitioner by the 
learned Civil Court for forfeiture of the earnest money upon 
admitted failure to fulfill the obligation or to pay the remaining 
consideration, which has attained finality. No one until today 
has approached the learned Civil Court claiming any interest in 
the property. No application for fraud or misrepresentation 
under section 12(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 is 

W.P No. 5915 of 2020 
 
 
13 
ever instituted by anyone. The Order dated 13.04.2012 reads 
that during the inquiry against Zaheer Abbas Ghumman-
convict, the petitioner is found to be beneficiary of illegal 
gains. We have very carefully gone through the final 
investigation 
report 
dated 
11.02.2010. 
In 
this 
final 
investigation report the only part that relates to the property 
simply states that Zaheer Abbas Ghumman-convict has 
purchased the property in the name of his father out of the 
crime proceeds for which Rs. 17.5 Million was paid as token 
money to the petitioner. However, today it is argued that the 
property is purchased in the name of Haq Nawaz brother of the 
said convict. There is no discussion in the entire record for 
reaching to the conclusion. The entire documents relied by the 
NAB-authorities lack reasonable grounds and it is purely based 
on mere suspicions and do not qualify the reasonable prudent 
person test settled in Shah Rukh Jamal case (supra).  
13.  
 
Starting from the year 2007 until today, NAB-
authorities have not brought the case of the petitioner before 
the learned Accountability Court for judicial scrutiny. The 
petitioner was not even summoned as a witness in any of  
references filed in Double Shah scam. No effort has been made 
to examine if the amount of earnest money paid by Haq Nawaz 
is actually proceeds of the crime. It is not argued before us that 
even Haq Nawaz has been tried for being benamidar or for 
using or having possession of crime proceeds. This is the 

W.P No. 5915 of 2020 
 
 
14 
position despite the fact that more than one decade has passed. 
Learned Special Prosecutor has submitted before us that the 
property is required to be sold for recovery of fine imposed 
against Zaheer Abbas Ghumman-convict under section 33-E of 
the Ordinance, however, he has failed to satisfy if this can be 
done without first establishing that the property is held as 
benami for any convict.  
14.  
 
For what has been discussed above, the present 
petition is allowed and the orders assailed are set-aside. No 
order as to costs.
