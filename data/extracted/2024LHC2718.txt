2.     Case opens up by Mirza Javed Anwar Baig complainant (died 
during the trial), through written application (Exh.PB), formalized later 
into FIR (Exh.PB/2) about the death of his step daughter Kanwal 
Javaid and granddaughter Tayyaba in his house in circumstances 
leading to culpable homicide. According to his narration, husband of 
Kanawal had gone to Jeddah and she along with her daughter

Criminal Revision No. 49773 of 2020

Tayyaba was residing with him at 412/A-1 Johar Town Lahore for his 
care as an ailing family member. On 21.04.2014 he went to reside 
with his son Mirza Munawar Hussain Baig (PW-5) at Government 
Punjab Society, as he usually did. On the next day i.e. 22.04.2014 at 
about 12:00 noon, he along with his driver returned; knocked at the 
door, finding no response from inside he rang her daughter on cell 
phone which was not attended, so he went to Hair Salon; returned 
again at about 01:45 p.m., repeated the knock and phone but while 
facing similar situation, he went to his in-laws at Rehmanpura. After 
another failed attempt at 3:00 pm, thinking she might have gone to 
her in-laws he decided to visit again. At 9.00 p.m. he returned with 
his son (PW-5) but situation remained same, no body opened the 
door. Suspecting some foul play he asked his son to access the house 
from the neighbour side who along with one Ahmad scaled over the 
wall of the house and found Kanwal was lying dead on a bed with 
marks of violence on her face and neck while in other room his 
maternal grand-daughter Tayyaba was also found dead on carpet 
whose hands and feet were tied having violence marks on her face 
too. FIR was registered against unknown accused persons. 
Subsequently complainant got recorded his supplementary statement 
mentioning that some household articles were also missing from the 
house.  
 
3.     Situation, empty and blank with no lead whatsoever, was given 
to investigator who visited the crime scene same night i.e., 
22.04.2014; inquest of dead bodies was formalized through injury 
statements and the inquest reports; PFSA crime scene unit was 
summoned who collected the articles, suspected to have biological 
stains, for DNA and also finger prints. An exhibit sheet showing 
collection of 22 articles from the crime scene was prepared by crime 
scene unit which they later deposited in the PFSA for analysis. 
Autopsy was done on the next morning. Police allegedly recorded 
statement of two witnesses on the same night (22.04.2014) who 
stated to have seen two unknown persons in the morning of 

Crl. Appeal No.58520 of 2020 
Criminal Revision No. 49773 of 2020 
 
 
 
3 
 
 
22.04.2014 at about 7.00 a.m. while leaving the house of occurrence 
on motor cycle with some articles wrapped in a cloth, like bale with 
LCD and they had a dialogue with unknown accused to know the 
presence of their landlord namely Masood Akbar Warraich, in the 
house of occurrence. Another set of witnesses namely Imran Yasin & 
Javid Iqbal recorded later who had seen Muhammad Umar and 
Muhammad Asim (accused/appellants) at the homestead of place of 
occurrence while ringing the doorbell at about 11.00 p.m. on 
21.04.2014. on arrest of accused/appellant, they were put to 
successful test identification parade, later number of stolen articles 
were also shown recovered from them. A SIM collected from the 
place of occurrence was found to be in the name of wife of 
Muhammad Asim, accused/appellant. PFSA report was returned with 
matching of some biological stains and finger prints with both the 
accused/appellants. They were accordingly challaned; disclosure of 
prosecution evidence was made to them and on the basis of 
information they denied the formal charge and claimed the trial.    
4. 
At the trial, prosecution examined as many as 17 witnesses; 
Muhammad Munir (PW.1), Ahmad Raza (PW.2), Imran Yasin  
(PW.3), Javed Iqbal (PW.4) Mirza Munawar Hussain Baig  (PW.5), 
Amjad Ali constable (PW-6), Muhammad Yahya S.I  (PW-7), Ch. 
Zia-ud-Din Chishti draftsman (PW-8), Muhammad Waqas constable 
(PW-9), Muhammad Sarwar ASI (PW-10), Muhammad Boota 
Constable (PW-11), Dr. Faiza Munir Qazi (PW-12), Dr. Shazia 
Manzoor  (PW-13), Khalid Hussain 1374/L ASI (PW-14), Mundassar 
Hassan Magistrate (PW-15), Muhammad Azeem Junior Forensic 
Scientist (PW-16) and Zulfiqar Ahmad Inspector (PW-17). 
Statements of accused/appellants under Section 342 Cr.P.C were 
recorded wherein they denied the prosecution version with the Claim 
that they have falsely been involved in this case. While responding to 
question No. 4, Muhammad Umar accused/appellant stated that he 
has been involved by Masood Akbar Warraich, his Khalo (husband of 
maternal aunt) however, both did not opt to record their statement 

Crl. Appeal No.58520 of 2020 
Criminal Revision No. 49773 of 2020 
 
 
 
4 
 
 
under Section 340(2) Cr.P.C. After conclusion of trial, they were 
convicted and sentenced forecited.  
5. 
In response to claim of appellants’ counsel that no direct 
evidence is available in this case, learned counsel for the complainant 
stated that DNA & finger prints evidence is sufficient to sustain the 
conviction and sentence of the accused/appellants and placed reliance 
on case reported as “MUHAMMAD SOHAIL alias SAMMA and 
others Versus The STATE” (2019 P Cr. L.J 1652). Learned Deputy 
District Public Prosecutor submitted that circumstantial evidence in 
this case has a big support to forensic evidence and hypothesis of 
innocence stands far away from the accused/appellants who are in 
tight clutches of prosecution evidence. She, finally supported the 
impugned judgment of conviction and sentence.  
6.        Proponents’ say in the light of available evidence put the Court 
at guard to minutely examine the march of prosecution to catch the 
alleged culpability of accused/appellants. 
 
7.    According to prosecution’s own showing, it was an unseen 
occurrence, hinges upon the circumstantial evidence which usually 
flows from the artefacts of death with sequence of articles lying near 
or around the dead body, examination whereof with naked eye by the 
police or expert is required to be done only in prescribed manner, 
procedural mandate is mentioned in Rule. 25.33 of Police Rules, 
1934, reproduced below:- 
25.33. Investigating Officer - action of at scene of death. - 
On arrival at the place where the body of a deceased person is 
lying, the police officer making the investigation shall act as 
follows:- 
 
(1) He shall prevent the destruction of evidence as to the 
cause of death.  
 
(2) He shall prevent crowding round the body and the 
obliteration of foot-steps.  
(3) He shall prevent unnecessary access to the body until the 
investigation is concluded.  
 
(4) He shall cover up footprints with suitable vessels so long 
as may be necessary.  
 
(5) He shall draw a correct plan of the scene of death 
including all features necessary to a right understanding of 
the case.  
 

Crl. Appeal No.58520 of 2020 
Criminal Revision No. 49773 of 2020

(6) If no surgeon or other officer arrives, he shall, together 
with the other persons conducting the investigation, carefully 
examine the body and note all abnormal appearance.  
 
(7) He shall remove, mark with a seal, and seal up all 
clothing not adhering to, or required as a covering for, the 
body, all ornaments, anything which may have caused or 
been concerned in the death of the deceased and shall make 
an inventory thereof.  
 
    In the inventory shall be described the position in which 
each thing was found and any blood-stain, mark, rent, injury 
or other noticeable fact in connection with such thing. The 
number and dimension of such stains, marks, rents, injuries, 
etc., shall also be given in the inventory.  
   
    A counterpart of the mark and seal attached to such thing 
or to the parcel in which it has been enclosed shall be entered 
in, or attached to, the inventory.  
 
Such inventory shall form part of the inquest report.  
 
(8) He shall take the finger prints of the deceased person if 
the body is unidentified.  
 
(9) The photographing of the body in situ and of the scene of 
the occurrence may prove of great evidential value. 
 
8.    Under the command of above Rule, investigating officer can seek 
technical assistance from the experts as per Rule 25.14 of Police 
Rules, 1934:- 
25.14. Technical assistance in investigation. –  
(1) Investigating officers are expected to take steps to secure 
expert technical assistance and advice, whenever such appears 
desirable in the course of an investigation for purposes of 
evidence or for demonstration in court.  
 
(2) The Criminal Investigation Department is able to obtain 
expert technical assistance on many subjects and should be 
freely consulted in that connection by investigating officers 
through their Superintendents of Police. When such assistance 
is required, a full report shall be sent to the Assistant Inspector 
General, Crime and Criminal Tribes, so that he may be in a 
position to decide whether it is essential to send an expert to 
the scene of the crime or whether the material to be dealt with 
should be sent to the expert. In making such reports use should 
be made of telegraphic and telephonic facilities.  
 
(3) The Criminal Investigation Department, in conjunction with 
the Finger Print Bureau, undertakes photographic and some 
other varieties of technical work. In addition, it is in contact 
with technical experts on may subjects, whose services can 
frequently be obtained for work in connection with criminal 
investigation. In respect of the examination of handwriting, 
investigating officers can obtain the services of the Examiner 
of Questioned Documents with the Government of India, 
through 
the 
Criminal 
Investigation 
Department. 
That 
department is also the channel for obtaining the services of the 
Inspector of Explosives for Northern India who, as well as 
advising on explosives generally, can give expert opinion as to 
whether a weapon has been recently fired, whether certain 

Crl. Appeal No.58520 of 2020 
Criminal Revision No. 49773 of 2020

matter is gunpowder or not, and all questions generally 
savouring of chemical analysis. 
 
Rule 25.14 in all covers calling in aid of PFSA teams for the purpose 
of preservation, collection, sampling and packaging of articles, 
biological stains and securing the finger prints followed by handing 
over the parcels to the police for its dispatch to PFSA analysis. 
Investigator is required to stamp such parcels with seal of police 
station by mentioning the particulars of case as required by Rule 
25.33 cited above, its entry into register No. 19 of police station and 
then after obtaining docket/permission from the senior police officer 
of the district ensure safe dispatch and deposit of parcels to PFSA. 
Rules-25.41 of Police Rules, 1934 relates to channel of 
communication with Chemical Examiner which mandates as under:- 
 
“Superintendents of Police are authorised to correspond with and 
submit articles for analysis to the Chemical Examiner direct in 
all cases other than human poisoning cases…...”  
 
Further requirement of Rule 25.41, has also been observed by this 
Court in case reported as “Meer Nawaz alias Meero Vs The State” 
(PLJ 2022 Cr. C 955 Lahore).  
 
9.    In no case, an expert can take the samples direct to PFSA for 
analysis because it is the investigator to decide what sort of analysis 
he is seeking in that particular case. Rule-25.41 (2) impliedly 
prohibits such practice which is mentioned in said Rule in the form of 
Notes: - (2) as under:- 
“(2) In no case should the Medical Officer attempt to apply tests 
for himself. Any such procedure is liable to vitiate the 
subsequent investigation of the case in the laboratory of the 
Chemical Examiner” 
 
Juxtaposing of above rule with mandate of PFSA is essential to see if 
any power is available to PFSA experts to take a lead on crime scene 
independent of investigators. As per section-4 of the Punjab Forensic 
Science Agency Act, 2007, functions of PFSA are as under:- 
4.   Functions of the Agency: The Agency shall: 
a) undertake examination of forensic material; 
 
b) render expert opinion with regard to examination of forensic 
material conducted by it; 
 

Crl. Appeal No.58520 of 2020 
Criminal Revision No. 49773 of 2020 
 
 
 
7 
 
 
c) procure, operate and maintain scientific instruments for 
examination of forensic material; 
 
d) propose advancement in forensic techniques and suggest use 
of suitable scientific instruments for examination of forensic 
material; 
 
e) seek clarification from the person involved in collection or 
handling of forensic material in the prescribed manner; 
 
f) recommend the procedure for the collection, preservation and 
handling of forensic material; 
 
g) subject to the direction of the Government, collect forensic 
material that requires special expertise or scientific methods 
for collection and preservation; 
 
h) maintain record for examination of forensic material, 
including record pertaining to the identity of a person 
connected with or accused of an offence, in the prescribed 
manner; 
 
i) promote general awareness on matters relating to forensics; 
and 
 
j) perform any other function connected with or ancillary to the 
above functions. 
 
As per above mandate, PFSA can seek clarification from the person 
who has collected or handled the forensic material in prescribed 
manner or subject to direction of government collect forensic material 
that requires special expertise or scientific methods for collection and 
preservation. Thus, in no case PFSA, at its own can visit the crime 
scene except summoned by the investigator which he must do if 
essential. Similarly, experts of PFSA also cannot dispatch material 
directly to PFSA.  
 
10.    Further introducing an expert in chain of safe custody of 
parceled articles would amount to compromise the process because it 
is the legal duty of police to dispatch such articles to PFSA and not 
the expert and if the custody protocols are breached, then police can 
be held responsible and not the experts. Such breach amounts to 
disobeying the direction of law or defective investigation which is 
culpable under sections 166 & 186 (2) of PPC, however, if at the 
crime scene any expert in connivance destroys or manipulates 
evidence  can be bracketed for offences under sections 166 or 217 of 
PPC but not otherwise because their function is to conduct test or 
analysis of forensic material, therefore, are held responsible only if 
tender false opinion as mentioned in section 13 of Punjab Forensic 
Science Agency Act, 2007 as under:- 

Crl. Appeal No.58520 of 2020 
Criminal Revision No. 49773 of 2020 
 
 
 
8 
 
 
 
“13. Offence: - (1) If an expert or official of the Agency 
knowingly or negligently renders false, incorrect or misleading 
opinion before a Court, tribunal or authority, he shall be 
punished with imprisonment which may extend to six months 
or with fine which may extend to fifty thousand rupees or with 
both” 
 
11. 
Admittedly, there was no direct evidence in the matter and the 
prosecution evidence was based upon circumstantial evidence in the 
form of ‘Wajtakar’. To believe or rely on circumstantial evidence, the 
well settled and deeply entrenched principle is that it is imperative for 
the prosecution to provide all links in chain as unbroken, where one 
end of the same touches the dead body and the other the neck of the 
accused. In a case reported as “MUHAMMAD TAYAB and another 
The STATE and others” (2023 YLR 2207), the Division Bench of this 
Court while citing and relying on following case law:- 
Gul Muhammad and others v. The State” (2021 SCMR 381); 
“NAVEED ASGHAR and 2 others Versus The STATE” (PLD 
2021 Supreme Court 600); “MUHAMMAD ISMAIL and 
others Versus THE STATE” (2017 SCMR 898), “AZEEM 
KHAN and another Versus MUJAHID KHAN and others” 
(2016 SCMR 274);“NIAZ AHMED Versus HASRAT 
MAHMOOD” 
(PLD 
2016 
Supreme 
Court 
70); 
“MUHAMMAD SALEEM Versus SHABBIR AHMED and 
others” (2016 SCMR 1605); “MUHAMMAD HUSSAIN 
Versus THE STATE” (2011 SCMR 1127); “ZAFAR ABBAS 
Versus THE STATE” (2010 SCMR 939 “TAHIR JAVED 
Versus THE STATE” (2009 SCMR 166); “IBRAHIM and 
others Versus THE STATE” (2009 SCMR 407); “ALTAF 
HUSSAIN Versus FAKHAR HUSSAIN and another” (2008 
SCMR 1103); “AKBAR ALI Versus THE STATE” (2007 
SCMR 486); “LIAQAT ALI Versus THE STATE” (2007 
SCMR 1307); “ABDUL MATEEN Versus SAHIB KHAN and

SCMR 1773); “AZIM Versus THE STATE” (PLD 1965

Federal Court 123). 
 
Including “LEJZOR TEPER versus THE QUEEN” (PLD 1952 Privy 
Council 119) & others, dilated upon the strands of circumstantial 
evidence like motive, plans and preparatory acts, capacity, 
opportunity, identity, continuance, failure to give evidence and failure 
to provide evidence, and held that circumstantial evidence must be 
conclusive.

12. 
Keeping in view the above standards of evidence and 
protocols/precautions, let the prosecution evidence be examined. 
Prosecution produced Mirza Munawar Hussain Baig PW-5 son of the 
complainant that he with the help of neighbour Ahmad Hassan Zaidi 
while scaling over to the place of occurrence had viewed the 
deadbody of Kanwal lying on the bed and that of Tayyaba in other 
room on the carpet with tied hands and feet and associated injuries on 
their bodies as mentioned in FIR. Ahmad Hassan Zaidi did not appear 
as a witness in the dock and investigating office Zulfiqar Ahmad PW-
17 in his deposition did not mention presence of Mirza Munawar 
Hussain Baig PW-5 at the crime scene when he first visited the place 
of occurrence. Though stated that he recorded the statement of many 
people including Munawar Baig at the spot but presence of this 
witness is doubtful in the sense that he has not been cited as attesting 
witness on any memo of spot recoveries. Non-appearance of Ahmad 
Hassan Zaidi and due to death of complainant his single testimony in 
the form of res gestae could not be corroborated. Thus, first relevant 
fact becomes rust putting a blur lens on rest of the evidence of 
prosecution.   
13.   Next set produced by prosecution was the witnesses of wajtakar 
namely Muhammad Munir PW-1 and Ahmad Raza PW-2, who 
claimed their arrival at 6.00 a.m. on 22.04.2014 at 36-N, Model Town, 
Lahore in order to meet Masood Akbar Warraich, landlord of their 
village but were informed of his presence at 412/A-1, Johar Town, 
Lahore (Place of occurrence), leading them immediately to  said 
house and when they reached at the place of occurrence at about 7:00 
a.m., they saw two persons coming out of said house on a motorcycle 
along with some household articles which were tied in a cloth in the 
form of a bale along with L.C.D. Both the witnesses PW-1 and PW-2 
also claimed that they had a dialog with said two persons and asked 
from them about Masood Akbar Warraich who responded that neither 
they know Masood nor he had come to this house, and both the said 
persons thereafter went away in their presence. The presence of these 

Crl. Appeal No.58520 of 2020 
Criminal Revision No. 49773 of 2020 
 
 
 
10 
 
 
two witnesses is not proved at the relevant date and time due to the 
reason that they have not stated the reason of their meeting with 
Masood Akbar Warraich and also did not tell the link of Masood 
Akbar Warraich with the house of occurrence. Further they did not 
explain features of two persons whom they met nor stated that in their 
presence both two accused have also locked the house and then went 
away. (Because according to prosecution, house was locked from 
inside). Further their story of moving from Model Town to Johar 
Town on foot and reaching there within half an hour is also not 
believable because both the places are at a quite distance. The fact of 
their relation with Masood Akbar Warraich is also a missing link due 
to non-appearance of Masood Akbar Warraich as witness. They 
conceded that they could not produce any proof regarding their visit to 
see Masood Akbar Warraich on the day of occurrence. Both the PWs 
during their cross-examination conceded the fact that they never 
pointed out the house of occurrence or the house of Masood Akbar 
Warraich to the I.O of the case. These PWs have not mentioned any 
weapon (Danda) etc. carried by accused/persons of this case while 
leaving the house of occurrence because prosecution did not claim 
availability of crime weapon at the place of occurrence on first 
inspection. Their statements are also not of worth because they did not 
see the accused/appellants in a situation when they were allegedly 
committing the murders.  
Claim of these PWs of their appearance before the police on the 
same night i.e., 22.04.2014 after registration of FIR also does not 
appeal to the reason because no supplementary statement of the 
complainant was available of said date and Ch. Zia-ud-din Draftsman 
conceded during cross examination that on Ex. PC (site plan), the I.O. 
has written in red notes that accused were not known till 28.04.2014. 
Further when these two witnesses appeared during identification 
parade, they might have given some statements but identification 
parade with complete proceedings was not produced in the evidence, 
therefore, it could not help the prosecution to use such identification 

Crl. Appeal No.58520 of 2020 
Criminal Revision No. 49773 of 2020 
 
 
 
11 
 
 
parade as explanatory evidence. Defence claimed these two PWs as 
stock witnesses being gunmen of Masood Akbar Warraich, Khalo of 
Muhammad Umar accused/appellant and PW-17 during cross 
examination stated for such fact as under:- 
“During my investigation from 08.05.2014 to onward, the 
complainant party did not produce any evidence to controvert 
that Muhammad Munir and Ahmad Raza were not gunmen of 
Khalu of accused.”   
 
       Investigating officer further conceded during cross-examination 
that neither he obtained CDR of these PWs nor collected any ticket 
etc. of their bus travelling to Lahore on the fateful day. Thus, presence 
of PW-1 & PW-2 could not be established as claimed by them.   
          14.     2nd set of two witnesses namely Imran Yasin PW-3 & Javid 
Iqbal PW-4 deposed to the effect that on 21.04.2014 at 11.00 p.m. 
they both saw the appellants while ringing the doorbell at house of 
occurrence. Imran Yousaf PW-3 claimed himself as an employee at 
Paan & cigarette shop of Khalid Hussain, father-in-law of Kanwal 
deceased while Javid Iqbal, PW-4 as Humzulf (husband of wife’s 
sister) of Khalid Hussain. According to their statement, they were 
proceeding to main bazar Johar Town on a motor cycle when saw the 
accused at the door of house of occurrence, and thereafter both these 
witnesses went to Rawalpindi who after their return came to know 
about the occurrence. PW-3 being permanent resident of Arifwala, 
Pakpatan was working at the rented shop of Khalid Hussain at Muslim 
Town Morr and Javid Iqbal was running his business of flower shop at 
Litton Road, Chowk Jinnah and Shahdara. Both being not of same age 
nor resident of Johar Town are not expected to be present at the place 
of occurrence at the relevant time; therefore, being chance witness, 
they could not justify their presence. It has further been observed that 
neither they submit the proof of their commutation to Rawalpindi, nor 
Khalid Hussain appeared as a witness to establish his relation with the 
witnesses as claimed by them. They both made statement before the 
investigating officer on 09.05.2014 as per deposition of PW-17. This 
delay of 18 days since 21.04.2014 could not be justified by them. 

Crl. Appeal No.58520 of 2020 
Criminal Revision No. 49773 of 2020 
 
 
 
12 
 
 
Thus, there testimony is of not a value to accept as a support to 
prosecution case.        
15. 
Identification parade was deficient to be read into the evidence 
because when Magistrate appeared before the trial Court to record his 
statement as PW-15 stated as under:-  
“It is correct that the original report and proceedings of 
identification parade recorded by me are not present before 
me.” 
 
A photo copy of identification parade was produced that too with one 
page missing wherein only the proceedings to the extent of PW-1 is 
mentioned. Mudassar Hassan, Magistrate (PW-15) while appearing 
before the trial Court has also not narrated the whole proceedings of 
identification parade, however, during cross examination claimed that 
PWs have stated the roles of accused but conceded that neither he 
recorded features of dummies nor mentioned that PWs have identified 
the accused with features, further conceded that he did not verify the 
objection raised by accused of their taking of pictures in the police 
station; therefore, fact of identification of accused remained unsatiated 
and was not proved. However, perusal of record shows that original 
report of identification parade is available in the file but could not be 
exhibited in evidence. It has further been observed that it was a joint 
identification parade which cannot be read against the accused/ 
appellants because it opposes to dictum laid down by Supreme Court 
of Pakistan in many cases like PLD 2019 Supreme Court 488 
wherein notice was given to Kanwar Anwar Ali, Special Judicial 
Magistrate for his dereliction of duty and lack of sufficient legal 
knowledge on conducting defective identification parade, and “Mian 
SOHAIL AHMED and others Versus The STATE and others” (2019 
SCMR 1956). 
16. 
As far as the recovery of certain articles belonging to the 
deceased are concerned, it is sufficient to mention complainant has 
not given any details of said articles during registration of FIR rather 
through his supplementary statement claimed that household articles

Criminal Revision No. 49773 of 2020 
 
 
 
13 
 
 
which includes mobile phone, LCD, gold ornaments, passport etc. 
were allegedly stolen by the accused/appellants. Such supplementary 
statement dated 22.04.2014 in the form of written application is 
available in the record but has not been exhibited as opposed to 
dictum laid down by Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case reported as 
“THE STATE and others Versus Abdul Khaliq and others” (PLD 
2011 Supreme Court 554), followed in case reported as “YASIR 
IMRAN alias YASIR ARAFAT Versus MUHAMMAD ASHRAF and 
another” (2014 MLD 337). Non-exhibition of such supplementary 
statement (in written form) seemed result of malafide because in such 
application names of Muhammad Asim and Muhammad Umar were 
mentioned as accused persons despite the fact source of their 
nomination was not available with the prosecution, as by then PW-1 
or PW-2 did not name any of the accused persons. It was a worst case 
of tunnel vision wherein investigation was fully directed and under the 
lead of influential who wanted to book the offenders at every cost. 
This malafide of prosecution could be arrested, had the complainant 
alive and appeared in the dock who did not care for whole day to 
check the house why it was locked with no response from inside, 
rather preferred to roam around different places without any tension or 
depression, and also did not inquire or seek help from the neighbours 
or relatives of her step daughter. All that shows that complainant was 
hiding something unpleasant against his own near and dear due to 
which his affinity with his step daughter fell short of. Thus, details of 
articles which were stolen could not be brought on record except in 
the form of recovery, later shown from the accused/appellants. I am 
conscious that PW-1 and PW-2 though have stated to have seen the 
accused/appellants with LCD and house hold articles but PW-1 
explained in examination in chief that household articles were in a 
cloth in the form of a bale. Similarly, PW-2 has also not stated the 
details of household articles that was the reason they were confronted 
with their statement under section 161 Cr.P.C. against the fact of 
carrying LCD. After recovery such articles were allegedly identified 
by the complainant, his son Munawar Hussain Baig PW-5 & mother 

Crl. Appeal No.58520 of 2020 
Criminal Revision No. 49773 of 2020

of Kanwal deceased. Complainant did not appear as witness as being 
dead, mother of Kanwal deceased was not produced, whereas PW-5 
neither narrated in his statement about the details of all articles nor he 
was the resident of house of occurrence so as to correctly identify 
such articles. Even otherwise process of identification of an article is 
also required to be conducted by the Magistrate in the same fashion as 
he does for identification of a suspect. This has been explained in law 
in terms that evidentiary value of identification parade as being 
relevant fact in the form of explanatory evidence is regulated under 
Article 22 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, relevant part may be 
read as under:- 
22. Facts necessary to explain or introduce relevant facts: 
Facts necessary to explain or introduce a fact in issue or 
relevant fact, or which support or rebut an inference suggested 
by a fact in issue or relevant fact, or which establish the 
identity of anything or person whose identity is relevant, or 
fix the time or place at which any fact in issue, or relevant fact 
happened, or Which show the relation of parties by whom any 
such fact was transacted, are relevant in so far as they are 
necessary for that purpose. 
                                                              (Emphasis supplied)  
 
The words ‘identity of anything or person’ in the above Article makes 
no difference of process for both.  I am also mindful of the fact that 
identification of articles in the manner as has been done in this case, is 
least permissible in law. The most essential requirement is that the 
witnesses should not have had an opportunity of seeing the property 
after its recovery and before its identification before the Magistrate. 
For that purpose, it is necessary to seal the property as soon as it is 
recovered and to keep it in a sealed condition till it is produced before 
the Magistrate. If the police officers who take the sealed bundles to 
the police station after recovery and who take it to the Magistrate for 
identification proceedings should be examined to prove that the sealed 
bundles were not tampered in the way. The sealed bundles should be 
opened in the presence of the Magistrate conducting the identification 
proceedings and he should depose about it. The property to be mixed 
with the property to be identified should also be sealed some days 
before witnesses are called and the bundle containing it should also be 

Crl. Appeal No.58520 of 2020 
Criminal Revision No. 49773 of 2020 
 
 
 
15 
 
 
opened in the presence of the Magistrate who should testify about it in 
Court. Further the result of identification should be entered in the 
memorandum by the Magistrate in his own hand. Reliance is placed 
on a judgment from Indian jurisdiction reported as “State of Vindhya 
Pradeshs v. Sarua Munni Dhimar and others” (AIR 1954 V.P 42 
(Vol. 41 C.N.15) and reliance is also on decision by Federal Shariat 
Court in cases reported as “NOOR ULLAH and 2 others versus THE 
STATE and another” (2012 YLR 2618) and “The STATE versus ZAR 
MUHAMMAD and 3 others” (2019 YLR 1663). On the touchstone of 
above referred citations, I have no doubt to hold that in the instant 
case the identification of recovered items has not been properly 
conducted, rendering the entire recovery a nullity in the eyes of law, 
therefore, it cannot be said with certainty that the recovered articles 
were the same which were allegedly stolen. The recovered jewelry, 
the alleged stolen property, has been attempted to be proved as 
belongings of the deceased but no receipt etc., was produced by the 
prosecution before the I.O in support of their stance. Similar is the 
position with the identification of mobile phones and other alleged 
stolen articles. The I.O neither got forensic audit of the said mobiles 
from the expert concerned who may have retrieved data therefrom 
including the person who were in use of these mobile phones. Such 
failure on the part of investigator makes the recovery of these articles 
doubtful. Supreme Court of Pakistan has held that in cases of 
circumstantial evidence, there is every chance of fabricating the 
evidence, which can easily be procured; therefore, Courts are required 
to take extra care and caution to narrowly examine such evidence with 
pure judicial approach to satisfy itself, about its intrinsic worth and 
reliability, also ensuring that no dishonesty was committed during the 
course of collecting such evidence by the investigators. If there are 
apparent indications of designs on part of the investigating agency in 
the preparation of a case resting on circumstantial evidence, the Court 
must be on guard against the trap of being deliberately misled into a 
false inference. Reliance is placed on case titled “Hashim Qasim and 
another Vs. The State” (2017 SCMR 986).

17.     SIM P-64 recovered from the place of occurrence by Zulfiqar 
Ahmad, investigator (PW-17) was claimed to be found in the name of 
wife of Asim accused/appellant. Muhammad Waqas 23386/C PW-9 
appeared as recovery witness of such SIM but conceded that he 
cannot tell the surroundings of place of occurrence, i.e., east, west, 
south and north despite the fact he visited that place thereafter 2/3 
times. Investigator PW-17 conceded that he had not recorded the 
statement of any official of mobile company in this respect. Further 
conceded that neither he took into possession the mobile phones of 
accused Muhammad Umar and Muhammad Asim nor collected their 
CDR. Thus, this evidence is also not useful for prosecution. 
18.      In this case, main stay of prosecution was of DNA profile 
matching and matching of finger prints. According to report of PFSA 
Ex.PAA, DNA profile obtained from Tape role, Right hand nail 
scraping of Tayyaba and swabs taken from glass (items; 2, 5 & 9.1) 
stood 
matched 
with 
DNA 
profile 
of 
Muhammad 
Asim 
accused/appellant whereas DNA profile generated from ‘Right hand 
nail scraping of Kanwal Bibi’(item-3) stood matched with DNA 
profile of Muhammad Umar accused/appellant. Similarly, as per 
Report EX.PBB, finger prints on ‘an empty used ceramic cup of tea’ 
were found to be identical with Muhammad Asim accused/appellant. 
It was shown that samples for DNA and LFP were collected by the 
crime scene unit of PFSA. PW-16 Muhammad Azeem Junior forensic 
scientist stated that he collected 22 exhibits from the place of 
occurrence mentioned in exhibit sheet Ex. PT and deposited the same 
before ERU (evidence receiving unit) of PFSA on 23.04.2014. First 
anomaly as observed was of direct depositing of samples by the expert 
which was not the mandate of PFSA as held in preceding paragraphs 
No. 8 & 9. Neither such samples were recorded in register No.19 of 
police station for their custody and then dispatch to PFSA nor PFSA 
report Ex. PAA mentions the name of any scientist who deposited 
such samples except the expression ‘received from crime scene unit’. 
PFSA has also not mentioned the nature of seal over such samples. 

Crl. Appeal No.58520 of 2020 
Criminal Revision No. 49773 of 2020 
 
 
 
17 
 
 
Some of the samples were also deposited by Muhammad Boota 
14412/C firstly on 28.04.2014 and then on 5th May, 2014 as 
mentioned in the PFSA report without specifying the nature of 
samples in the report. If Boota was the man who deposited the 
samples and that too on 5th May, 2014, then prosecution case becomes 
zero because by then accused have already been arrested on 
29.04.2014. Thus, sampling is in serious doubts. No seminal material 
was detected on the vaginal swabs of victims/deceased ladies which 
indicates a different story, if the victims were at the mercy of accused 
for whole night. No drug or poison was detected from the water rinse 
bottles which were transmitted to the office of PFSA for analysis. It 
has further been observed that despite the fact that human DNA was 
obtained from items 1.1, 4, 6, 7.1, 8.1, 10.1, 11.1, 12.1, and 15 but no 
DNA profile matching was done, similarly, analysis of item 16 was 
also not done. All that indicate something adverse to prosecution, 
disclosure of which may have run against the culpability of accused 
persons and it can safely be said that it was an attempt to hide or 
conceal something to save the actual culprits responsible for such 
murders. Thus, Prosecution has not come up with complete truth. It 
has further been observed that expert who appeared as PW-16 neither 
deposed about the complete process of collection of samples with 
precautions taken to avoid contamination nor stated the places from 
where his team preferred to take such samples. In this case what the 
expert or police had collected from the spot remained within the 
knowledge of police and experts only because neither complainant, 
his son nor other private person are the attesting witnesses to such 
sampling and collection. Moreover, deposition of Zulfiqar Ahmad 
PW-17, investigator put another doubt when he without naming the 
forensic scientist said that “officials of crime scene unit of PFSA 
procured finger prints and DNA sampling of accused persons 
thorough collecting 22 different articles” which raises a suspicion that 
sampling was done in the presence of accused/appellants that was the 
reason both accused/appellants while responding to question No.4 in 
their statements under section 342 Cr.P.C stated that they were 

Crl. Appeal No.58520 of 2020 
Criminal Revision No. 49773 of 2020 
 
 
 
18 
 
 
arrested much prior to the date as shown by the police. These 
statements of accused/appellants also lend support from the deposition 
of investigator PW-17 when stated that “I formally arrested the 
accused Muhammad Asim and Muhammad Umer on 29.04.2014”. 
Word “formally” has clear connotation that they were already in 
custody. Sans direct evidence and frail circumstantial evidence, Court 
cannot record conviction mere on the basis of PFSA reports 
particularly when there are serious doubts on preservation, collection, 
packaging and dispatch of samples. Reliance is on case reported as 
“BAHADER KHAN Versus THE STATE and another” (2012 P Cr. L 
J 24).  
19. 
On the basis of claim for matching of DNA profile of 
Muhammad Asim with DNA available on tape role, glass and nail 
scraping of Tayyaba; and finger prints on ‘an empty used ceramic cup 
of tea’ were found to be identical with Muhammad Asim accused, 
likewise matching DNA of Muhammad Umar with nail scraping of 
Kanwal deceased, learned counsel for the complainant stated that 
conviction can be recorded even on the basis of forensic evidence and 
has referred proviso to Article 164 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 
1984. Which says that “conviction on the basis of modern devices or 
techniques may be lawful”. Counsel was reminded that proviso to 
Article 164 was added in the year 2017 but present case relates to the 
year 2014 well before the said amendment. Even otherwise, non-
analysis of item No.16 and non-disclosure of matching of human 
DNA on other items with any other person or with the 
accused/appellants plus above cited irregularities make such evidence 
doubtful. Even otherwise such reports are only corroborative evidence 
and corroborative evidence could only be relied upon if the 
prosecution has proved the case through substantive evidence and in 
this case, there is no direct evidence of committing of murder; 
circumstantial evidence structured by the prosecution is of no worth to 
rely on to pass or uphold conviction against the accused/appellants.

Criminal Revision No. 49773 of 2020

20. 
So far as medical evidence is concerned, it has been observed 
that Kanwal died of asphyxia due to manual restriction of breathing 
while applying yellowish sticky material while Tayyaba due to head 
injury in the nature of gapped incised wound on her forehead. Nobody 
has witnessed the occurrence; therefore, the condition of dead bodies 
hardly helps the prosecution to claim it as supportive evidence. Even 
no evidence of rape was available due to absence of marks of violence 
near or around the organs of generation as mentioned in postmortem 
reports, nor seminal material was detected on the vaginal swabs. Thus, 
medical evidence in this case is only in support of a fact in issue that 
two ladies have met unnatural death. It is trite that medical evidence 
cannot be made basis to record or sustain conviction because it could 
only give details about the locale, dimension, kind of weapon used, 
the duration between injury and medical examination or death and 
autopsy, etc. but never identifies the real assailant. In the case 
“MUNAWAR ALI alias MUNAWAR HUSSAIN versus THE STATE” 
(PLD 1993 Supreme Court 251) the Supreme Court of Pakistan held 
that:- 
“Medical evidence is corroboration to show that injuries were 
caused in a particular manner, with particular weapon and 
even it can supply corroboration to the fact as to how many 
assailants there were and whether number of injuries is 
commensurate with number of assailants or not, but, medical 
evidence can never be used as corroboration qua accused to 
show that particular accused has caused these injuries.” 
 
21. 
For what has been discussed above and having considering all 
the pros and cons of this case, I have come to this irresistible 
conclusion that the prosecution could not prove its case against the 
appellant beyond reasonable doubt and it is trite that to extend benefit 
of doubt to an accused person, it is not necessary that there should be 
several circumstances creating doubt, rather one reasonable doubt is 
sufficient to acquit. Reliance is placed on the cases “Sajjad Hussain 
Vs. The State” (2022 SCMR 1540) and “Abdul Ghafoor Vs. The 
State” (2022 SCMR 1527). Consequently, the appeal is allowed and 
the accused/appellants Muhammad Umer and Muhammad Asim are 
acquitted of the charges. They are directed to be released forthwith if 

Crl. Appeal No.58520 of 2020

not required in any other case. The case property, if any, shall be 
disposed of in accordance with law and the record of the trial Court be 
sent back immediately.  
22. 
In the light of above discussion, Criminal Revision No.49773 of 
2020 for enhancement of sentence of the appellants has become 
infructuous and is dismissed.
