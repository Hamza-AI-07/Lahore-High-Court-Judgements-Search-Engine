AHMAD NADEEM ARSHAD, J. This civil revision is 
directed against the judgment and decree dated 24.05.2016 passed 
by the learned Appellate Court whereby while accepting the appeal 
of respondents No.2 to 4 set aside the judgment and decree dated 
10.04.2014 of learned trial court and resultantly, dismissed the 
petitioner‟s suit for possession through pre-emption. 
2. 
Facts in brevity are that the petitioner (plaintiff) instituted a 
suit for possession through pre-emption on 07.10.2003 against 
respondent No.1 (defendant No.1) and pre-empted the sale effected 
through sale deed No.7034 dated 3.7.2003 whereby one Akhtar 
Hussain Rizvi sold out a piece of land measuring 01 Kanal 
(hereinafter referred to as suit property) for a consideration of 
Rs.9,00,000/- to respondent No.1 by maintaining that being Shafi 
Shrik, Shafi Khaleet and Shafi Jar he has a superior right of pre-
emption over respondent No.1; that respondent No.1 kept the sale 
transaction secret from him in order to defeat his right of pre-
emption; that he came to know about this transaction on 30.09.2003 
at about 10.00 a.m. through Muhammad Naseem Khan at his 
residence while sitting with Shafat Hussain Rizvi and Mehdi 
Hassan; that he on receiving the said information then and there 

Civil Revision No.3252 of 2016 
-2-
announced to exercise  his right of pre-emption with regard to the 
suit property and in this way he performed Talb-i-Muwathibat; that 
thereafter he sent a notice of Talb-i-Ishhad duly attested by the 
witnesses, namely, Muhammad Naseem  Khan and Mehdi Hassan 
on 01.10.2003 through a registered post AD to respondent No.1 and 
in this way he performed Talb-i-Ishhad; that despite receipt of 
notice of Talb-i-Ishhad respondent No.1 is not ready to transfer the 
suit property which constrained him to institute the suit and in this 
way performing Talb-i-Khusumat and prayed for decree of his suit; 
that despite issuance of notice no one appeared on behalf of the 
respondent No.1; that on 13.12.2003 the petitioner moved an 
application under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC with the contention that 
respondent No.1 (vendor) further alienated the suit property to 
respondents No.2 to 4 through registered sale deed No.11378 dated 
08.09.2003, therefore, they are proper and necessary party and 
prayed for their impleadment; that the learned trial court allowed 
the said application vide order dated 8.1.2004 and directed the 
petitioner to implead said subsequent vendees in the array of 
defendants, therefore, the petitioner impleaded said subsequent 
vendees as defendants No.2 to 4 (respondents No.2 to 4); that said 
respondents filed their contesting written statement on 23.4.2012 by 
raising certain preliminary objections to the effect that the suit is 
not maintainable in its present form;  that the suit is hopelessly 
barred by time; that the plaintiff has no cause of action against them; 
that the plaintiff has no locus standi to file the suit against them; 
that the plaintiff is estopped from his own  conduct to file the suit; 
that the plaintiff did not make any demand of pre-emption to the 
answering defendants so he has no  cause of action against them;  
that no right of pre-emption is vested to the plaintiff; that plaint is 
liable to be rejected under Order VI Rule 11 CPC; that the plaintiff 
has not come to the court with clean hands and he misstated and 
mis-represented the facts to the court; that the suit is absolutely 
false, frivolous and liable to be dismissed with special costs. While 
replying on facts admitted that Akhtar Hussain Rizvi sold the suit 

Civil Revision No.3252 of 2016 
-3-
property to respondent No.1 through sale deed No.7034 dated 
03.07.2003, however, maintained that said respondent further 
alienated the suit property to them and they are bona fide 
purchasers of the suit property on 26.09.2003 from respondent No.1 
without any notice and prayed for dismissal of the suit. The learned 
trial court while keeping in view the divergent pleadings of the 
parties framed necessary issues and invited them to produce their 
respective evidence. After recording evidence of the parties pro and 
contra, oral as well as documentary decreed the suit vide judgment 
and decree dated 11.03.2014. Feeling aggrieved respondents No.2 
to 4 preferred an appeal which was allowed by the learned appellate 
court vide judgment and decree dated 24.05.2016 and while setting 
aside the judgment and decree of the learned trial court dismissed 
the petitioner‟s suit for possession through pre-emption. Being dis-
satisfied the petitioner has approached this Court through the 
instant  civil revision. 
3. 
The revision petition was fixed before this Court on 
24.9.2024. On the said date learned counsel for the petitioner has 
sent a written request for adjournment. On his request case was 
adjourned to 01.10.2024 with a warning that no further 
adjournment shall be granted.  On 01.10.2024 again no one 
appeared on behalf of the petitioner and adjournment was sought on 
his behalf. Therefore, case was adjourned to 02.10.2024. The same 
was the position on 2.10.2024, therefore, no option left with the 
Court to hear the arguments of the respondent No.2 to 4. 
4. 
The arguments of learned counsel for respondents No.2 to 4 
were heard and case was reserved for announcement of the 
judgment with a direction to the petitioner to file written arguments, 
if he desired.  Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted written 
arguments on behalf of the petitioner which are made part of the 
file. I have carefully examined the written arguments submitted on 
behalf of the petitioner, the arguments advanced by learned counsel 
for respondents No.2 to 4, perused the record and the case laws 
cited at bar. 

Civil Revision No.3252 of 2016

5. 
From careful examination of the record, it appears that the 
petitioner pre-empted the sale executed through registered sale deed 
No.7034 dated 03.07.2003 in favour of respondent No.1. No one  
appeared on behalf of respondent No.1 to rebut the claim of the 
petitioner. However, it is a matter of record that before 
announcement with regard to exercise of the right of pre-emption 
on 30.09.2003 (Talb-i-Muwathibat), sending notice of Talb-i-
Ishhad on 01.10.2003 and institution of the suit on 07.10.2003 the 
suit property had already been alienated through registered sale 
deed No.11378 by respondent No.1 to respondents No.2 to 4 which 
was executed on 26.09.2003, presented for registration on 
27.09.2003, referred to the local commission for recording of the 
statement on the same date the statements of the parties recorded on 
27.09.2003 and registered on 08.10.2003.  
6. 
Respondents No.2 to 4 took a stance that the petitioner failed 
to pre-empt the sale executed in their favour whereas the petitioner 
claimed that he pre-empted the first sale executed in favour of 
respondent No.1, therefore, he was not required to pre-empt the sale 
executed after institution of his suit, as it was hit by principle of lis 
pendence. 
7. 
Before deciding the said crucial point of determination 
whether the petitioner was required to pre-empt the sale executed in 
favour of respondents No.2 to 4 or not it is better to see whether he 
had successfully proved his right of pre-emption against respondent 
No.1 or not.  In this regard first two issues are relevant which are 
reproduced as under:- 
1. Whether plaintiff has fulfilled requirements of Talbs as 
per law? OPP. 
 
2. Whether the plaintiff has superior right of pre-emption 
qua the defendant? OPP. 
 
8. 
The onus of proof of the said issues were placed upon the 
petitioner. In order to discharge the said onus the petitioner 
appeared in the witnesses box as PW-1 and produced Muhammad 
Naseem Khan, Informer and attesting witness of the notice of Talb-

Civil Revision No.3252 of 2016 
-5-
i-Ishhad as PW-2,  Mehdi Hassan the witness of Majlis and 
attesting witness of notice of Talb-i-Ishhad as PW-3 and Naeem 
Yameen, Postman as PW-4. The petitioner also produced order 
dated 4.7.1988 passed by this Court in Civil Original No.22 of 1983 
titled as Syed Akbar Hussain Rizvi, etc. Vs  Shah Noor Studio Limited, 
etc. as Exh.P-1, copy of plan whereby shares of the parties with 
meats and bound were mentioned as Exh.P-2, copy of notice of 
Talb-i-Ishhad as Exh.P-3, copy of registered sale deed executed in 
favour of respondent No.1  as Exh.P-4 and receipt of registry as 
Exh.P-5 and closed his oral as well as documentary evidence.  
9. 
Section 6 of the Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1991 (hereinafter 
referred to as „Act‟) provides a list of person in whom the right of 
pre-emption vest. For better understanding the said section is 
reproduced as under:- 
“6. Persons in whom the right of pre-emption vests---(1) 
The right of pre-emption shall vest— 
 
(a) firstly, in Shafi Sharik; 
(b) secondly, in Shafi Khaleet, and 
(c) thirdly, in Shafi Jar 
Explanation---(i) “Shafi Shrik” means a person who is a 
co-owner in the corupus of the undivided immovable 
property sold. 
(ii)  “Shafi Khaleet” means a participator in the special 
rights attached to the immovable property sold, such as 
right of passage, right of passage of water or right of 
irrigation. 
(iii) “Shafi Jar” means a person who has a right of pre-
emption because of owning an immovable property 
adjacent to the immovable property sold. 
(2)    Notwithstanding  anything in subsection (1) the right 
of pre-emption shall be exercisable only in case of 
„Zarooat‟ or to avoid „Zarar‟. 
 
            Perusal of said section appears that it recognizes that the 
right of pre-emption vest „firstly‟, in Shafi Sharik i.e a co-owner in 
the undivided immoveable property sold, „secondly‟, in Shafi 
Khaleet i.e participator in the special rights attached to the 
immoveable  property sold; and „thirdly‟, in Shafi Jar i.e an owner 
of immoveable property adjacent to the immoveable property sold. 

Civil Revision No.3252 of 2016

10. 
The above quoted provisions of section 6 of the Act serially 
and separately categorized the superior claims to the right of pre-
emption of a pre-emptor as Shafi Sharik, Shafi Khaleet and Shafi 
Jar. Each definition sets out the scope, the qualifications and the 
condition of each of these rights. A pre-emptor may have a claim to 
the right of pre-emption on the basis of any one or more of the 
prescribed qualifications. The pre-emptor in order to succeed must 
successfully established such right on the day of sale, on the day of 
filing of suit and its continued subsistence till the date of decree. 
The underline principle of law of pre-emption is that the preemptor 
has to own property before he can exercise such right. For reference 
reliance is placed on the case titled Mushtaq Hussain Vs Fateh Khan and 
others (PLD 2015 SC 27) wherein it was held as under:- 
“The facts would reveal that pre-emption was allowed when 
the pre-emptor own property either adjacent to the preempted 
one or the parties shared a water channel or common 
thoroughfare adjacent to their respective properties but not in 
the present case when it has not been demonstrated at all by 
the appellant that he own any property adjacent to the 
common passage i.e he could be termed as Shafi Jar. In so far 
as his right of pre-emption based upon being Shafi Khaleet is 
concerned again as observed above no special rights are 
attached to the pre-empted property as the passage is a 
common one of which appellant only owns one marla.” 
 
11. 
In order to prove his superior right of pre-emption the 
petitioner produced copy of order dated 04.07.1988 passed by this 
Court in Civil Original No.22 of 1983 titled as Syed Akbar Hussain 
Rizvi, etc. Vs  Shah Noor Studio Limited, etc. as Exh.P-1 and site plan 
of the property as Exh.P-2. Perusal of order dated 04.07.1988 
(Exh.P-1) it appears that name of the petitioner does not figure 
anywhere. No doubt in the site plan of Shah Noor Studio (Exh.P-2) 
the name of the petitioner is mentioned and described that the area 
shown in red belonged to the petitioner alongwith other shareholder. 
But said plan is not substitute of title document. Neither any 
inheritance mutation was placed on record nor copy of record of 
rights was produced to establish that he is a co-sharer or co-owner 
in the suit khata from where the pre-empted property was sold. 

Civil Revision No.3252 of 2016 
-7-
Mere admission on behalf of the DWs that suit property situated in 
Shah Noor Studio and belongs to father of the petitioner and 
petitioner‟s house was situated in the Shah Noor Studio does not 
discharge the petitioner to establish independently that he is owner 
of the property from  where pre-empted property was sold and he 
enjoyed the status of Shafi Sharik,  Shafi Khaleet and Shafi Jar. In 
view of said discussion the petitioner failed to prove his superior 
right of pre-emption. 
12. 
The petitioner claimed that he got the information with 
regard to the sale of the suit property on 30.09.2003 at about 10.00 
a.m when he was sitting in his house. However, the informer PW-2 
Muhammad Naseem Khan did not depose in his examination-in- 
chief that he passed on said information to the petitioner at 10 a.m. 
In this way, he failed to point out time of Talb-i-Muwathibat 
whereas PW-3 in his examination in chief maintained that about 
9.00 or 9.30 a.m. the petitioner‟s Manager Muhammad Naseem 
Khan came there and maintained that on a plot situated in front of 
Floor No.4 and Music Hall some labourers were working and the 
said labourers informed that a person namely Tariq Nawaz 
purchased the plot, then, the petitioner promptly announced that he 
will institute the pre-emption suit. The said witness also failed to 
give exact time as to when the informer informed and the petitioner 
announced to exercise his right of pre-emption. In this way the 
petitioner failed to prove Talb-i-Muwathibat. 
13. 
The petitioner claimed that he sent the notice of Talb-i-
Ishhad through registered AD. Although receipt of the registered 
post was produced as  Exh.P-5 and Postman was got examined but 
failed to bring on record the acknowledgment due.  
The non-production of the “acknowledgment due” card in 
the evidence, which is a mandatory obligation under the law, crumbles 
down the structure of Talbs. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan 
in a case titled “BASHIR AHMED Versus 
GHULAM 
RASOOL” (2011 SCMR 762) held as under:- 

Civil Revision No.3252 of 2016 
-8-
“This Court in the judgment reported as “Muhammad 
Bashir v. Abbas Ali Shah (2007 SCMR 1105)” inter alia 
held that notice of Talb-i- Ishhad must be served on the 
vendee and the service of the addressee as prescribed in law 
is imperative and if the acknowledgment due carries an 
endorsement of „refusal‟ or „not accepted‟ a presumption of 
service would arise unless rebutted and if the addressee 
makes a statement on oath denying the service, then the 
onus to prove would be on the party relying upon such 
notice. It has further been held that if service of notice was 
denied by the vendee, then it was for the pre- emptor to 
prove service of notice by producing Postman, who 
allegedly made the endorsement. In the present case neither 
the service of the petitioner was effected as required under 
the law, nor any acknowledgment due carrying an 
endorsement of „refusal‟ or „not accepted‟ was produced in 
evidence. The present case is on better footing as in this 
case the plaintiff failed to produce any evidence to show that 
the defendant was „served with a notice of Talb-i-Ishhad or 
that he refused to accept the notice, in as much as, 
acknowledgment due was not placed on record. Under the 
circumstances, to our mind, it was imperative for the 
plaintiff, in order to succeed in the suit for pre-emption, to 
produce evidence, including the Postman, to prove that in 
fact notice was served upon the petitioner or that he 
refused to accept the notice, which was sent at his correct 
address. We find that the learned High Court dismissed 
petitioner‟s revision petition primarily on the ground that, “a 
plaintiff is not required to produce the acknowledgment due 
receipt as the only requirement is that the sending of notice 
through registered post acknowledgment due. The plaintiff is 
not required to establish on record that the said notice has 
been received by the vendee and its acknowledgment receipt 
was also received by the plaintiff after its service on the 
vendee.” The said findings are not in consonance with the 
law on subject, inasmuch as, those were rendered contrary to 
the law laid down by this Court in the case of Muhammad 
Bashir (ibid)” (emphasis supplied) 
 
In this way he failed to establish the valid performance of 
notice of Talb-i-Ishhad.  
14.  The next question for determination is that whether the 
petitioner was required to pre-empt the sale effected through sale 
deed executed in favour of respondents No.2 to 4 or the said sale 
deed is hit by the principle of lis pendence.  
15. 
Respondents No.2 to 4 produced registered sale deed 
No.11378 as Exh.P-1. Perusal of the said sale deed it appears that 
respondent No.1 sold the suit property to respondents No.2 to 4. 

Civil Revision No.3252 of 2016 
-9-
Said sale deed was executed on 26.09.2003 and was presented for 
registration to the Sub-Registrar on 27.09.2003 and forwarded to 
local commission for recording the statements. The local 
commission summoned the vendor (respondent No.1) on 
27.09.2003 (Saturday) at 4/5.00 p.m and recorded the statements of 
the parties on the same day. Said sale deed was subsequently 
registered on 08.10.2003.  
16. 
No doubt the petitioner allegedly performed the requisite 
Talbs i.e Talb-i-Muwathibat, Talb-i-Ishhad and Talb-i-Khusumat 
before the registration of sale deed executed in favour of 
respondents No.2 to 4 but admittedly said Talbs were performed 
after execution of the said sale deed.  
17. 
  In order to appreciate the point involved in the instant case 
whether the sale deed was operative on the date of execution or 
from the date of registration it is necessary to  see section 47 of the 
Registration Act, 1908 which is reproduced as under:-  
47. Time from which registered document operates.---A 
registered documents shall operate from the time from which it 
would have commenced to operate if no registration threof had 
been required or made, and not from the time of its registration.  
 
          The Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case titled 
Naseer Ahmed and another Vs Asghar Ali (1992 SCMR 2300) held as 
under:- 
“The High Court however, excluded from consideration the 
purchase of 4 Kanals land by the appellants for different reasons. 
There is no controversy that the sale deed in respect of this land 
was executed in appellants‟ favour on 8.9.1974 i.e. a day before 
the institution of the suit. It was presented for registration on 
9.9.1974 but registered on 10.9.1974. In the opinion of the High 
Court as the document was registered after the institution of the 
suit, the transaction was of no avail to the appellants. The view 
taken by the High Court is untenable. Section 47 of the 
Registration Act seemingly escaped notice of the learned Judges of 
the High Court which provides that a document registered on a 
date subsequent to the date of its execution operates from the date 
of the execution. Obviously, therefore, the title to the land had 
passed on to the appellants on 8.9.1974 and could justifiably bank 
on it to oppose the suit filed by the respondents.” 
 

Civil Revision No.3252 of 2016 
-10-
For further reference the Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan 
in a case titled Ghulam Rasool and others Vs Akbar Ali and others 
(2011 SCMR 794) observed as under:- 
“A bare perusal of the said provision of law manifests that a 
registered document shall operate from the time, day, when it 
was written and signed and it will create, right, title and 
interest in favour of the transferee from the date of execution 
and not from the date of registration.” 
 
18. 
Section 47 of the Registration Act, 1908 postulates that a 
registered document would take effect from the date of its 
execution and not from the date of registration. Admittedly, the 
subsequent transfer deed was executed on 26.09.2003 and was 
registered on 08.10.2003. So, in view of the ratio of the referred 
cases, the subsequent transfer was made prior to making of talbs 
and institution of pre-emption suit. Thus, the principal of lis 
pendence is not applicable to this case on this ground, as well.  
19.     No doubt once a pre-emption suit stands instituted, a vendee 
is prohibited from entering into sale or re-sale of the pre-empted 
property. It is obvious because the lis is pending adjudication. Even 
otherwise, it is a matter of common sense that the provision of 
section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 would get attract 
only and only when the lis is pending. However, in the instant case 
further sale made by the vendee prior to the institution of pre-
emption suit, could not be brought within the four corners of lis 
pendence and such further sale would be a new transaction 
altogether of the pre-emptor, if interested in preempting the said 
sale, would have instituted a suit against the latest sale but not 
against the previous one. For reference reliance has been placed on 
the cases titled Abdul Yameen Khan Vs Ashrat Ali Khan and others 
(2004 SCMR 1270) and Muhammad Rafique and 7 others Vs Noor Ahmed 
(2007 MLD 1557).  
20. 
Although the sale deed is incomplete till the formality of 
registration has been gone through, but once that requirement is 
fulfilled the sale takes effect from the date of its execution. In view 
of section 47 of the Registration Act, 1908 its application cannot be 

Civil Revision No.3252 of 2016 
-11-
confined only to the parties to the document; it equally applies to a 
third person or for that matter to a pre-emptor. For reference 
reliance has been placed on case titled Raja Muhammad Azan Vs Asghar 
Hussain (1999 YLR 2480).  
21. 
It is undisputed fact of the case that the petitioner did not 
perform Talb-i-Muwathibat or Talb-i-Ishhad qua the subsequent 
sale nor he alleged any such Talbs in his plaint. Likewise, he did 
not adduce any evidence in this regard which was sine qua non for 
successful exercise of right of pre-emption. Whereas the subsequent 
sale was an independent transaction, which was required to be pre-
empted in accordance with law of pre-emption. 
22. 
Though there is divergence of views in the courts below and 
conclusions are contrary to each other but this Court, while 
exercising its revisional jurisdiction in terms of section 115 of CPC 
supposed to make comparative analysis of both judgments in order 
to determine their validity on the touch stone of said provision. It is, 
cardinal principle of law that in the matter of giving preference to 
the judgments of learned lower courts, while analyzing the same  in 
exercise of revisional jurisdiction, the preference and regard is 
always given to the findings of the learned Appellate Court, unless 
those are suffering with any legal infirmity or material irregularity. 
The Hon‟ble Supreme  Court of Pakistan in case titled Muhammad 
Nawaz through LRs Vs Haji Muhammad Baran Khan through LRs and others 
(2013 SCMR 1300) observed as under:- 
“12…..We have also taken into consideration the judgments  
of the appellate court which is based on proper appraisal of 
evidence on record and the findings of the appellate court are 
to be preferred as it has been held by this Court in the case of 
Madan Gopal and others V. Maran Bepari and others (PLD 
1969 SC 617) that in the findings of fact reached by the first 
appellate court is at variance with that of the trial court, the 
former will ordinarily prevail, although it would not possess 
the same  value or sanctity as a concurrent findings. This 
view also finds support from the cases of Muhammad Shafi 
and others v. Sultan Mehmood and others (2010 SCMR 
827)……..” 
 

Civil Revision No.3252 of 2016 
-12-
The above view also finds support from the cases of Amjad Ikram v. 
Mst. Asiya Kausar and two others (2015 SCMR 01) and Muhammad 
Hafeez and another v. District Judge, Karachi East and another (2008 
SCMR 398).  
23.      For the foregoing reasons learned Appellate Court has 
rightly set-aside the judgment & decree of learned trial Court and 
dismissed the suit of the petitioner/plaintiff. Learned counsel for the 
petitioner failed to point out any illegality, mis-reading and non-
reading of evidence in the findings of learned appellate Court. I 
have minutely gone through the record available on the file as well 
as the impugned judgment and decree passed by the learned 
Appellate Courts. I have seen no illegality, irregularity, mis-reading 
or non-reading of evidence and jurisdiction defect on the part of 
learned appellate Court while passing the impugned judgment and 
decree.  
24. 
 
As an inevitable corollary of above discussion, instant 
civil revision having no force is hereby dismissed with no order as 
to costs.
