SULTAN TANVIR AHMAD, J:–This 
second appeal, filed under section 100 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908 (the ‘Code’), is directed against judgment 
and decree dated 30.03.2015 passed by learned Additional 
District Judge, Wazirabad as well as judgment and decree 
dated 19.07.2011 passed by learned Civil Judge, 
Wazirabad. 
2.  
  
The 
respondent 
instituted 
suit 
dated 
16.02.2005 (the ‘suit’) for ejectment through specific 
performance of agreement to sell dated 28.12.2004 (the 
‘agreement’) with the averments that the appellant agreed 
to sell the plot as described in the suit (the ‘suit property’) 
to the respondent against consideration of Rs. 475,000/-, 
out of which Rs. 200,000/- was paid and the remaining 

 
RSA No. 214 of 2015 
 
 
2 
consideration 
of 
Rs. 
275,000/- 
(the 
‘remaining 
consideration’) was agreed to be paid by or before 
15.02.2005 (the ‘cut-off date’), however, the appellant 
failed to fulfill his obligations. The agreement was 
admitted between the parties, whereas, the appellant 
denied any fault at his part in fulfillment of obligations 
under the agreement and disputed the willingness of the 
respondent to perform the agreement by the cut-off-date. 
Out of material proposition of law and facts disputed 
between the parties the learned trial Court framed the 
issues. On 19.07.2011 while giving issue-wise findings the 
learned trial Court decreed the suit in the following 
manners:- 
  
“ Resultantly, the decree is granted in 
favour of the plaintiff, requiring him to 
deposit remaining sale price of Rs. 2,75,000/- 
within one month, after which he shall be 
entitled to get the execution and registration 
of sale deed in his favour….” 
 
  
 
The appellant filed civil appeal No. 87 of 
2011 on 30.07.2011 before the learned First Appellate 
Court, which was dismissed vide judgment and decree 
dated 30.03.2015. Being dissatisfied from the concurrent 
decisions, the present second appeal has been filed.  
3.  
 
 Mr. 
Muhammad 
Mehmood 
Chaudhary-
learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that the 
learned two Courts below have failed to properly 
appreciate the concept that the time was of essence of the 
contract and default by the respondent in appearance 
before the concerned Sub-Registrar on the cut-off date 
disentitles him from the discretionary relief of specific 
performance. Mr. Shahid Farooq Gondal-learned counsel 
for the respondent  has opposed the same and he stated that 
the respondent remained willing to discharge his 

 
RSA No. 214 of 2015 
 
 
3 
obligations within the agreed time period and  then 
throughout the proceedings before the learned trial Court.  
4.  
 
Learned counsel for the parties have also read 
the various parts of the evidence led before the learned trial 
Court in order to convince as to the following questions:- 
1. Whether the respondent had capacity to 
perform the agreement and if he remained 
willing to fulfill his obligations under the 
agreement? 
2. Whether the learned Courts below are 
justified in grant of specific performance 
of the agreement instead of allowing 
double of the earnest money as per the 
stipulation in the agreement?  
 
  
 
The respondent produced Syed Muhammad 
Anwar Shah (Manager Allied Bank Limited) as PW-1, 
who deposed that amount equal to the balance 
consideration was withdrawn by the respondent on the cut-
off date through cheque No. 39583836. He was subjected 
to cross-examination but hardly anything could be 
extracted from which any inference can be drawn that the 
respondent has not withdrawn the amount involved on the 
cut-off date. Rizwan Malik / the respondent appeared as 
PW-6. He stood by his stance adopted in the suit. The 
remaining PWs (i.e. PW-2, 3, 4, 5 and 7) also supported 
his stance. In order to disprove the same, learned counsel 
for the appellant has referred to application dated 
15.02.2005 (the ‘application’) given by the appellant 
containing some confirmation of the registry moharrar and 
a stamp of the Sub-Registrar, however, Mr. Muhammad 
Mehmood Chaudhary has conceded that the Sub-Registrar 
or the moharrar were never produced as  witness. Section 
22 of the Specific Relief Act, 1977 (the ‘Act’) clearly 
provides 
that 
the 
jurisdiction 
to 
decree 
specific 
performance is discretionary and the Court is not bound to 

 
RSA No. 214 of 2015 
 
 
4 
grant such relief merely because it is lawful to do so; but 
the discretion of the Court is not arbitrary but sound and 
reasonable, guided by judicial principle and capable of 
correction by a Court of Appeal”. This provision has 
repeatedly been interpreted by Courts. The discretion is 
required to be exercised keeping in view the facts and 
circumstances of each case and the terms of the relevant 
agreement. Exercise must not be arbitrary and has to be 
based on sound and equitable reasons. It is also equally 
settled that stipulation of double payment of earnest 
money, simultaneously, do no bar to exercise the 
discretion to grant specific performance and the agreement 
to sell does not cease to remain operative to have it 
enforced through the Court of law for obtaining transfer of 
the property1.  
5.  
 
The respondent had instituted the suit on 
16.02.2005 i.e. a day after the cut-off date. He through his 
evidence remained successful in demonstrating with 
certainty that he had capacity to perform the agreement. 
The concerned branch manager produced the ledger in the 
learned trial Court to show that through banking 
instrument the respondent has withdrawn the balance 
consideration on 15.02.2005. This leaves no doubt that the 
respondent had capacity to perform the agreement. His 
willingness is reflected from the prompt and immediate 
institution of the suit. By that time no prejudice was caused 
to the appellant but somehow he himself kept on delaying 
the matter. Mr. Muhammad Mehmood Chaudhary -learned 
counsel for the appellant stated that the agreement pertains 
to the year 2005 and now in the year 2024 if the specific 
performance is granted in favour of the appellant, the same

SCMR 1621)

shall be violative of the law settled in “Muhammad Abdur 
Rehman Qureshi”2 and “Ms. Sara Bibi”3 cases that the 
rule regarding time is essence in every contract of property 
was settled many centuries ago when the prices of real 
estate used to remain stagnant and its high time that this 
rule is revised in view of the rapid increase in the prices of 
the real estate market. Mr. Muhammad Mehmood 
Chaudhary -learned counsel for the appellant is correct in 
this submission, however, he failed to show it from the 
record that the delay is attributable to the respondent. As 
already has been discussed that the respondent wasted no 
time in instituting the suit and he has shown his capacity to 
perform the agreement. Almost in similar circumstances in 
“Lehrasap Khan and 3 Others”4 case this Court has 
already observed that even assuming that the seller did not 
approach the concerned Sub-Registrar, the prompt and 
immediate institution of the suit was a proof of readiness 
and willingness.  
6.  
 
So far as the application instituted before 
Sub-Registrar is concerned, it is admitted position that no 
one from his office was produced in evidence as witness. 
A learned Division Bench, somewhat in the identical 
circumstances, in “Taj Deen”5 case reached to the 
following conclusion:- 
  
“…The presence of vendors before the 
Sub-Registrar 
on 
the 
date 
fixed, 
the 
application which has been produced as mark 
‘C’, was to be proved by summoning the Sub-
Registrar who allegedly reported on 4-7-2005

through L.Rs. and Others” (2024 MLD 467) and “Shaukat Ali and 3 Others Versus 
Javeed Qureshi and 5 Others” (2002 CLC 1578) (The applications before Sub-Registrar, 
which were returned to the applicants, were held to be not sufficient to prove readiness 
and willingness).

but no such procedure has been adopted. 
Furthermore, the plaintiff-appellant has filed 
the suit just one day after the expiry of date of 
maturity of agreement to sell….”      
 
 
After reading of the record and considering 
the arguments, I am of the firm view that the learned two 
Courts below have rightly exercised their discretion to 
grant the relief which is already reproduced above and the 
stipulation as to double payment of earnest money by itself 
does not debar from exercising the such discretion.  
7.  
 
The second appeal only lies in the High Court 
on the grounds that the decision is being contrary to law; 
failure to determine some material issue of law, and 
substantial error or defect in the procedure provided by the 
Code or law for the time being in force which may 
possibly have emanated an error or slip-up in the 
determination or decisiveness of the case on merits6. I have 
not observed any such illegality, therefore, this second 
appeal is dismissed. No order as to costs.
