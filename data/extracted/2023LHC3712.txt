AALIA NEELUM, J:- The appellant-Taha Azam Ullah, son 
of Tariq Saif-ur-Rehman, Caste Pathan, resident of Street Store Wali near

arrears of land revenue and in case of default thereof, to undergo 06-months 
S.I further.        
2. 
 
Feeling aggrieved by the judgment of the learned trial court, 
Taha Azam Ullah, the appellant, has assailed his conviction by filing the 
instant appeal bearing Criminal Appeal No.27767 of 2019. The learned trial 
court also referred M.R. No.241 of 2019 (The State. Vs. Taha Azaam 
Ullah) for confirmation of the death sentence awarded to the appellant-Taha 
Azam Ullah. Whereas the complainant also filed Crl. P.S.L.A No.41181 of 
2019 against the acquittal of respondents Nos.1 to 3, namely Junaid Ahmad 
Khan, Quadrat Ullah Shahab, and Tariq Saif-Ur-Rehman. All the matters 
arising from the same judgment of the learned trial court are being disposed 
of through a single judgment. 
3. 
 
Briefly, the prosecution story as alleged in the private 
complaint (Ex. PC) of Adnan Abdullah Khan (PW-1)-the complainant is that 
on 28.06.2017, at about 06:00 P.M., the complainant (PW-1) along with his 
brother, namely, Shahzad Abdullah Khan (deceased), Ejaz Ahmad Khan 
(given up PW) and Saif Ullah Khan (PW-2) were proceedings towards 
chowk of Mirza Ghafoor to offer swings to the children and when they 
reached the chowk of Mirza Ghafoor, meanwhile, Taha Azam Ullah-the 
appellant armed with a pistol, Junaid, Quadrat Ullah and Tariq Saif-Ur-
Rehman (co-accused since acquitted), all while armed with firearm weapons, 
came there. Tariq Saif-Ur-Rehman (co-accused since acquitted) raised 
Lalkara that Shahzad Abdullah Khan (deceased) be not spared and he be 
done to death. After that, the accused-Taha Azam Ullah made a fire shot 
which hit Shahzad Abdullah Khan (deceased) on the upper part of the left 
shoulder. The accused-Taha Azam Ullah made another fire, which hit the 
deceased on the left side of his back towards the upper side. The accused-
Taha Azam Ullah made a third fire, which hit the deceased on the right side 
of the abdomen. The accused-Taha Azam Ullah made a fourth fire, which hit 
the deceased on the left side of the abdomen. After that, the accused-Junaid 
fired four shots at Shahzad Abdullah Khan (deceased), of which three fires

& P.S.L.A No.41181 of 2019

were hit near his left knee while the fourth hit his thigh. Then, the accused, 
Quadrat-Ullah Shahab, fired at the deceased, which hit him on the right 
thigh, and second fire of the accused, Quadrat-Ullah Shahab, was hit on the 
right leg of the deceased, Shahzad Abdullah Khan, due to which the 
deceased fell and succumbed to the injuries. Due to the firing of accused 
persons, a passerby child also sustained firearm injury. The complainant and 
prosecution witnesses witnessed the alleged occurrence.  
4. 
 
The motive behind the occurrence was that one Tahir Ishfaq-
Ur-Rehman, brother-in-law of the complainant, was serving as Sub-
Inspector in Punjab Police and was martyred in 2010. The property left by 
him was illegally possessed and usurped by Tariq Saif-ur-Rehman and his 
sons; the issues relating to said property were being looked after by the 
widow of the deceased and brother of the complainant, namely Shahzad 
Abdullah Khan (deceased). Due to said grudge, all the accused persons, in 
prosecuting their common object, murdered Shahzad Abdullah Khan, 
deceased.  
5. 
 
Based on the complaint (Ex. PA), formal FIR (Ex. PB) was 
chalked out by Muhammad Yaqoob, S.I (CW-2). After the registration of the 
case, the investigation of this case was conducted by Zafar Fareed, S.I (CW-
7), who found the accused/appellant guilty, prepared a report under section 
173 of Cr.P.C. Being dissatisfied with the result of the investigation, as the 
investigating officer being in league with the accused did not investigate the 
matter properly, the complainant was constrained to file a private complaint 
(Ex. PC). After recording the cursory evidence of the complainant and 
having perused the record, all the accused persons were found connected 
with the commission of the offence, so they were summoned to face the 
charge. After that, the learned trial court formally charged the appellant and 
his co-accused on 01.03.2018, to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed 
trial. In support of his version, the complainant produced as many as four 
(04) witnesses, whereas the prosecution produced the witnesses as C.W-1 to 
C.W-7.

Ocular account, in this case, has come out from the statements 
of Adnan Abdullah (PW-1)-the complainant, and Saif Ullah Khan (PW-2)-
the eye witness, whereas Dr. Rao Taimoor Hameed Khan (CW-5), who 
conducted the postmortem examination of Shahzad Abdullah Khan (the 
deceased) found the following injuries on his person: -                    
INJURIES 
1. 
A penetrating firearm entry wound of 1 x 1 cm 
on the left shoulder, 2 cm behind the acromion

1 cm in front of the left shoulder with 
blackening and shooting present.  
2.

behind the left shoulder just below the spine of 
the left scapula with no apparent exit wound.  
3.

on the right side of the abdomen 14 cm from 
the umbilicus, making an exit of 2 x 1 cm 
behind the right buttock. 
4. 
A penetrating firearm entry wound of 1 x 1 cm 
on the left side of the abdomen, making an 
exit of 1 x 2 cm above the right buttock. 
5. 
A penetrating firearm entry wound of 1 x 1 cm 
on the left-right front side 10 cm from the 
inguinal ligament, making an exit of 2 x 2 cm 
behind the left thigh. 
6.

9.  
A 3 x 1 cm graze injury of bullet 14 cm above 
the medial malleolus. 
10. 
A penetrating firearm entry wound of 1 x 1 cm 
on the right thigh 4 cm from the inguinal 
ligament, making an exit of 2 x 2 cm on the 
right buttock. 
11. 
A penetrating firearm entry wound of 1 x 1.5 
cm on the right thigh 13 cm from the inguinal

13.  
A penetrating firearm entry wound of 1 x 1 cm 
on the right thigh’s lateral side, exit 2 x 2 cm 
behind the right buttock.  
 
After conducting the postmortem examination, the 
doctor opined that the cause of death was severe hemorrhage 
and shock, leading to cardiopulmonary arrest. However, 
injuries No.2, 3, and 4 themselves are sufficient to cause the 
death of an ordinary human being following the normal course 
of nature.  The probable time between injury and death was 
immediate, whereas between death and postmortem was about 
09 to 12 hours.  
The statements of the remaining prosecution witnesses are formal in nature.  
7. 
 
The complainant gave up Haji Ahmad, Aamir Khan, and Ijaz 
Ahmad Khan, being unnecessary. The learned Assistant District Public 
Prosecutor closed the prosecution evidence after tendering the Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency reports and firearms &Tool marks Examination 
(Ex. PH & Ex. PJ). 
8. 
 
The appellant was also examined under Section 342 Cr.P.C., 
wherein neither he opted to appear as his own witness under Section 340(2) 
Cr.P.C., nor he produced defence evidence. In response to a particular

Crl. Appeal No.27767 of 2019 
& P.S.L.A No.41181 of 2019

question that why this case was against him and why the PWs deposed 
against him, the appellant made the following deposition: - 
“Complainant and PWs are inter-se related, 
and they deposed falsely against me just to 
blackmail. The complainant & witnesses were 
belatedly summoned as they have no concern at 
the place of occurrence.”  
 
9. 
 
After evaluating the evidence available on record in light of 
arguments advanced from both sides, the learned trial court found the 
prosecution version proved beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt, which 
resulted in the appellant’s conviction in the afore-stated terms. 
10. 
 
We have given our anxious and most thoughtful consideration 
to both sides’ rival submissions. We have minutely gone through the 
evidence on record.  
11. 
 
As per the prosecution case, the incident took place on 
28.06.2017 at 06:00 p.m. in the area of Chowk Mirza Ghaffar, Farooq Abad, 
within the area of Police Station, City Farooq Abad, District Sheikhupura, 
which is at a distance of 03-Farlang from the place of occurrence. Adnan 
Abdullah Khan (PW-1)-the complainant reported the incident through 
written complaint (Exh. PA) to Muhammad Yaqoob, S.I. (CW-2) at P.S. 
City Farooq Abad, after that F.I.R. (Ex. CW-2/A) was registered at 07:15 
p.m. Adnan Abdullah Khan (PW-1)-the complainant, took one hour and 
fifteen minutes to report the incident to the police. Adnan Abdullah Khan 
(PW-1)-the complainant deposed during cross-examination that after about 
15 minutes of the occurrence, he went to Bazar and got drafted a written 
complaint. In this regard, Adnan Abdullah Khan (PW-1)-the complainant, 
deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“After about 15 minutes of the occurrence I 
went to Bazzar got drafted an application for 
registration of criminal case by operator of 
photo state machine. I did not write the 
application for registration of case myself. The 
shop of photo state operator is about 2 Farlang

Crl. Appeal No.27767 of 2019 
& P.S.L.A No.41181 of 2019

from the place of occurrence. I did not produce 
the said operator of photo state machine before 
the police nor I introduce his name to the police 
to verify the fact I got drafted the application 
from him. I did not telephonically informed the 
police immediately regarding the occurrence. 
The witness volunteered I produced the 
application before the police. The police station 
and the place of occurrence both situates within 
the town of Farooqabad. The distance between 
the place of occurrence by a motorbike is about 
10/15 minutes. The distance between place of 
occurrence and police station city Farooqabad 
is about 3 Farlang. I went to up to photo state 
machine on foot. During this way there are so 
many shops and markets. The distance between 
the place of photo state machine and police 
station is about 2 and half Farlang. The photo 
machine operator was known to me earlier.------
----Though I had to prepare an application for 
registration of case so, I did not opt to go police 
station first.” 
Contrary to the above, Adnan Abdullah Khan (PW-1)-the complainant 
deposed during cross-examination that:- 
“Police arrived at the place of occurrence after 
about one and half/two hours after the 
occurrence. The witness volunteered that upon 
arrival of the police I got written the application 
for registration of case and went to police 
station and then police came at the spot and 
then after police brought the dead body.” 
Muhammad Yaqoob S.I. (CW-2) deposed during cross-examination that:- 
“The application for registration for Criminal case Ex.PA is 
undated and untimed.” 
Saif Ullah (PW-2) deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“Police firstly arrived at the place of occurrence 
after about one and a half hour.” 
Whereas, Zafar Fareed S.I. (CW-7)-the investigating officer deposed during 
cross-examination that: -

“On 28.06.2017 I received the copy of the FIR 
alongwith 
the 
original 
application 
for 
registration of FIR at about 07:30. The 
occurrence in this case took place at 06:00 PM 
on 28.06.2017 and the FIR stood registered at 
the police station at 07.15 PM on the same day.-
--------------On receiving of FIR I immediately 
rushed to place of occurrence where Saif Ullah 
Khan, Ijaz Ahmad Khan, Adnan Abdullah 
Khan, Qaisar and Aamir were present.-----------
-----I prepared inquest report in accordance 
with law with due care.” 
 
 
Contrary to the depositions of the above witnesses i.e. Adnan 
Abdullah Khan (PW-1)-the complainant, Saif Ullah (PW-2) and Zafar 
Fareed S.I. (CW-7)-the investigating officer, Muhammad Yaqoob S.I. (CW-
2) deposed during examination-in-chief that on receiving the complaint (Ex. 
PA), moved by Adnan Abdullah Khan (PW-1)-the complainant, on his 
dictation, F.I.R. (Ex. CW-2/A) was generated through the computer system. 
In this regard, he (CW-2) deposed during examination-in-chief that: - 
“I lodged formal FIR through the computer 
system. I dictated the contents of FIR to the 
computer operator. The copy of FIR generated 
through computer system is Ex.CW-2/A. This 
copy of FIR bears correct contents according to 
application and my endorsement upon the 
application and bear my signatures. Then 
afterwards I sent the original application for 
registration of case and copy of FIR to Zafar 
Fareed SI In-charge Homicide Wing Saddar 
Circle by Zahid Javed 938/C.” 
During cross-examination, Muhammad Yaqoob S.I. (CW-2) admitted that: - 
“Whenever an application for registration of 
criminal case is presented, an E-Tag number is 
marked upon such FIR  with    date.    The   E-
Tag  number  of  this  FIR   is  CF-6/29/2017-
609 dated 29-06-2017. -------------According to 
FIR the case was registered on 28.06.2017 at 
07:15 P.M dated 29-06-2017.” 
Adnan Abdullah Khan (PW-1)-the complainant admitted during cross-
examination that: -

& P.S.L.A No.41181 of 2019

“Might be I received a receipt for submission of 
my application for registration of case from 
police station city Farooqabad. I signed over 
receipt Ex. DA for submission of my application 
for registration of case. ----------My I.D card 
number and Cell phone number have been 
written on Ex. DA. The time of reporting the 
matter is written in Ex. DA on 29.06.2018 at 
1:42 am.” 
 
 
On perusal of FIR (Ex. PB), it reveals that on its top E-Tag 
No.CF-6/29/2017-609, 
Serial 
No.SKP-CFA-000129 
was 
written. 
Admittedly, the serial number was written at the top of the FIR along with 
its E-Tag number, while chalking out FIR (Ex. PB), and the serial number 
and the E-Tag number cannot be inserted later on. If the contents of the FIR 
were written and the computer operator cannot complete the FIR in one go, 
they can save the data already entered by choosing the "SAVE" tab. After 
writing complete data in the online FIR themselves and clicking the "FINAL 
SUBMIT" button, no change will be possible/entertained if required. The E-
Tag No.CF-6/29/2017-609, and Serial No.SKP-CFA-000129 was not 
handwritten. Rather, before submitting FIR, E-Tag No.CF-6/29/2017-609, 
and Serial No.SKP-CFA-000129 was written. After entering data online, 
changing the entries in the FIR is impossible. There is a specific column in 
the FIR i.e., column No.1 wherein date and time of the report of the crime 
are to be mentioned and Muhammad Yaqoob S.I. (CW-2) deposed that on 
his dictation the contents of FIR were typed by the computer operator.  So, 
in the column No. 1 of FIR (Ex. CW-2/A) the time of reporting 07:15 PM on 
28.06.2017 was typed by the computer operator as dictated by Muhammad 
Yaqoob S.I. (CW-2). Muhammad Yaqoob S.I. (CW-2) made the following 
answer to the question of the Court: - 
“The copy of FIR Ex.PB and Ex.CW-2/A are 
the copy of the same FIR which was exhibited 
twice, however I signed upon the copy of 
Ex.CW-2/A.” 
 
 
Muhammad Yaqoob S.I. (CW-2) signed the copy of Ex. CW-
2/A and on the top of the copy of Ex.CW-2/A -Tag No.CF-6/29/2017-609, 

Murder Reference No.241 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No.27767 of 2019 
& P.S.L.A No.41181 of 2019 
 
10
and Serial No.SKP-CFA-000129 are mentioned. The E-Tag number reveals 
that the complaint was made on 29.06.2017 at 01:42 a.m. On perusal of the 
online receipt (Ex. DA), it reveals that the same was signed by Adnan 
Abdullah Khan (PW-1)-the complainant, and the online receipt of the online 
complaint number mentioned therein is CF-6/29/2017-609 dated 29 June 
2017 at 01:42 AM and status was pending, and the incident was reported 
about the murder and complaint was handed over to Zafar Fareed S.I. Zafar 
Fareed S.I. (CW-7)-the investigating officer deposed during cross-
examination that “E-tag Number written on copy of FIR is 609 dated 
29.06.2017.” The learned trial court, while dealing with the issue, held that 
the computer at the front desk did not work due to interception in the supply 
of electricity. As and when such FIR is uploaded on the internet, an 
independent E-tag number containing the time and date of its uploading is 
automatically generated by the internet system itself according to software 
prepared for linking up these FIRs to the internet. This date and time given 
in E-tag cannot be manually marked. Rather computer and internet system 
itself mark such a particular number. While holding that there is no delay in 
the registration of FIR, the learned trial court overlooked the fact that FIR 
was not entered in the register meant for registration of FIRs available at 
each police station. Muhammad Yaqoob S.I. (CW-2) deposed that he lodged 
the FIR through the computer system, and on his dictation to the computer 
operator, the contents of the FIR were generated. It suggests that there was 
no electricity breakdown in the police station at the time of lodging of FIR, 
as stated by Muhammad Yaqoob S.I (CW-2). Admittedly, the statement 
under section 154 Cr.P.C. of Adnan Abdullah Khan (PW-1)-the complainant 
was not incorporated in the register for FIRs registration. Muhammad 
Yaqoob S.I (CW-2) admitted in his examination-in-chief that FIR was 
lodged through the computer system on his dictation, and the computer 
operator entered the same. The prosecution has not produced the Computer 
Operator to whom dictation was given by Muhammad Yaqoob S.I. (CW-2), 
and he typed the FIR (Exh.CW-2/A), nor the name of the computer operator 
came on the record. According to Rule 24.5 of Police Rules 1934, the F.I.R. 

Murder Reference No.241 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No.27767 of 2019 
& P.S.L.A No.41181 of 2019 
 
11
shall be filled in the printed Form in Form 24.5(1) with pages serially 
numbered with three carbon copies (each of the four pages of the register 
bearing the same serial number). Since the written complaint (Ex. PA) was 
not recorded in the first information report register, it throws doubt on the 
time of reporting the incident to the police. Whenever information regarding 
cognizable offence is lodged with the police officer, he is obliged to take the 
same down in writing if it is made orally or receive the complaint in writing 
and straightaway proceed to enter the substance of it in the book/register 
kept for that purpose in terms of Section 154 of the Criminal Procedure 
Code. Chapter XIV CRPC deals with giving/reporting information to police 
in cognizable cases and its power of investigation. Section 154 of CrPC 
deals with the registration of FIR by the officer in charge of a police station 
based on the information about a cognizable offence. It casts a statutory duty 
on him to enter the substance of such information in the prescribed 
register/form, which is commonly called FIR, and the act of entering it is 
called registration of a crime or case. The police did not register F.I.R. 
(Exh.CW-2/A) in the book/register kept for registration of cases and instead 
entered the complaint in the computer and assigned a number. No 
explanation has been furnished regarding how the FIR registration number 
and E-tag number appeared on this document. It leads to only one inference 
that the document is prepared later. The evidential value of the First 
Information Report will be reduced if it is made after the unexplained delay, 
particularly when the same was not entered in the printed Form 24.5 (1) of 
Police Rules 1934. At this stage, it is relevant to reproduce Rule 24.5. 
hereunder:- 
“24.5. First Information Report Register.-----(1) 
The First Information Report Register shall be 
a printed book in Form 24.5. (1) consisting of 
200 pages and shall be completely filled before a 
new one is commenced cases shall bear an 
annual serial number in each police station for 
each calendar year. Every four pages of the 
register shall be numbered with the same 
number and shall be written at the same time 
by means of the carbon copying process.

The original copy shall be preserved in the 
Police Station for a period of sixty years. The 
other three copies shall be submitted as 
follows:- 
(a) 
One to the Superintendent of Police or 
other gazetted officer nominated by him. 
(b) 
One to the Magistrate empowered to take 
cognizance of the offence as is required by 
Section 157, Criminal Procedure Code. 
(c) 
One to the complainant unless a written 
report in Form 24.2(1) has been received 
in which case the check receipt prescribed 
will be sent. 
(3) 
In the case of the railway police, the copy 
intended for the magistrate empowered to take 
cognizance of the offence shall be submitted 
through the Superintendent of the district 
police; Provided that at railway police station, 
other than district headquarter stations, where 
there is a Magistrate having jurisdiction, one 
copy shall be sent to such magistrate direct, one 
to the Deputy Superintendent of the Railway 
Police and another to the Superintendent of 
District Police. The extra copy required in such 
cases will be made by inserting an extra sheet of 
paper and carbon paper and afterwards filling 
the printed headings, etc., by hand. 
(4) 
All information required by the form 
shall be filled in, and thereafter the serial 
number of each case diary submitted shall be 
noted on the reverse of the original copy which 
is to remain at the police station. 
(5) 
On the conclusion of the case the 
particulars contained in the charge sheet slip 
shall be filled in on the reverse of the original 
copy 
and

According to Article 112 of the Police Order, 2002 (22 of 
2002), the Provincial Police Officer/Inspector General of Police, Punjab, 
with the approval of the Government of Punjab, made amendments in Rules

The Provincial Police Officer may, by

(2) 
in rule 22.4, for clause (a), the following shall be 
substituted: 
“(a) He shall: 
(i)

(electronic copy) of the registers as

Officer; 
(ii)

of 
all 
the 
correspondence as per instructions of 
the officer incharge of the police 
station; and 
(iii) write all reports and returns called for 
by the competent authority.” 
 
 
A bare perusal of the above amendment would show no 
reference to Rule 24.5 to be amended. The fact that lodging FIR was made

& P.S.L.A No.41181 of 2019

on the computer due to the above amendment cannot justify that FIR was 
legally lodged. No amendment to Rule 24.5 was made. The act of 
Muhammad Yaqoob S.I. (CW-2) does not align with the law and, thereby, is 
in absolute violation and non-compliance with Section 154 Criminal 
Procedure Code and Rule 24.5 of Police Rules, 1934. The FIR is the 
document entered into a book/register maintained at the police station under 
Rule 24.5 of Police Rules, 1934. The statement of complainant is entered 
therein under section 154 Criminal Procedure Code. Based on this, the law is 
set into motion. The mandatory provisions of the law were departed, which 
creates doubt about the truthfulness of the allegation leveled in the FIR and 
that when the incident was reported to the police and left unexplained holes 
in the prosecution story, the benefit of which must accrue to the accused. 
12. 
 
Another aspect of the case makes the prosecution case doubtful. 
Zafar Fareed (CW-7)-the investigating officer deposed that on receiving of 
FIR (Exh.CW-2/A), he immediately rushed to the place of occurrence, 
where Adnan Abdullah Khan (PW-1), Saif Ullah Khan (PW-2), Qaisar 
Rasheed Khan (PW-3), Ijaz Ahmad Khan (PW given up), and Aamir (PW 
given up) were present, and he (CW-7) prepared the inquest report by the 
law with due care. Adnan Abdullah Khan (PW-1)-the complainant deposed 
during cross-examination that: - 
“Police arrived at the place of occurrence after 
about one and half/two hours after the 
occurrence. The witness volunteered that upon 
arrival of the police I, got written the 
application for registration of case and went to 
police station and then police came at the spot 
and then after police brought the dead body.” 
Saif Ullah (PW-2) deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“I do not know that upon arrival of police, what 
document was prepared first by them. Police 
remained at the place of occurrence for about 1 
or 3/4 hour.” 
Zafar Fareed S.I. (CW-7)-the investigating officer admitted during cross-
examination that: - 

Murder Reference No.241 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No.27767 of 2019 
& P.S.L.A No.41181 of 2019 
 
15
“I noted the names in column No.4 of inquest 
report the names who were present at the place 
of occurrence. The witness volunteered that 
they were also relatives of the complainant. The 
complainant being brother of deceased is closer 
relative than the persons stated in column No.4 
of inquest report. The name of complainant and 
alleged PWs is not stated in column No.4 of 
inquest report. The two persons Aamir Khan 
and Qaiser Rasheed Khan were present at the 
time of preparation of inquest report so I noted 
the names of these two persons in column No.4 
of the inquest report.” 
 
 
Zafar Fareed S.I. (CW-7)-the investigating officer prepared an 
inquest report (Ex.CW-5/C), wherein the names of Adnan Abdullah Khan 
(PW-1)-the complainant, and Saif Ullah (PW-2) have not been mentioned in 
column No.4, and the inquest report (Ex.CW-5/C) was not signed by any of 
the eye witnesses or the complainant. Although Zafar Fareed S.I. (CW-7)-
the investigating officer, has categorically asserted that he recorded the 
statements of the witnesses under section 161 of Cr.P.C. and also made the 
investigation, which shows that the witnesses were not present at the place 
of occurrence. The inquest report (Ex. CW-5/C) was signed by Aamir Khan 
(given up PW) and Qaisar Rasheed Khan (PW-3). Adnan Abdullah Khan 
(PW-1)-the complainant deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“Aamir Pw belongs to Faisalabad, whereas the 
Pw Qaisar Rasheed belongs to Kot Sondha. I 
did not informed Aamir through Telephone 
regarding 
the 
occurrence. 
The 
witness 
volunteered that he had already come in the 
house of Qaisar Rasheed.--------------I called 
Qaisar 
Rasheed 
through 
telephone 
and 
informed him about the occurrence. On the day 
of occurrence my cell phone was active. I did 
not call the police through telephonically.” 
 
 
The complainant, after half an hour after the incident, went to 
the market and got drafted a complaint (Ex. PA), and after that, he went to 
the police station to report the incident. The above deposition of Adnan 
Abdullah Khan (PW-1)-the complainant, reveals that before reporting the 
incident to the police, he (PW-1) managed witnesses, i.e., Aamir Khan 

Murder Reference No.241 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No.27767 of 2019 
& P.S.L.A No.41181 of 2019 
 
16
(given up PW) and Qaisar Rasheed Khan (PW-3). Admittedly, Aamir Khan 
belongs to Faisalabad, whereas Qaisar Rasheed Khan (PW-3) belongs to Kot 
Sondha. During cross-examination, Adnan Abdullah Khan (PW-1)-the 
complainant, admitted that Amir Khan PW is his maternal cousin and 
brother-in-law. The distance between the place of occurrence and Faisalabad 
is about 70/80 kilometers. Qaisar Rasheed-PW is his maternal cousin, and he 
was a resident of Kot Sondha. Kot Sondha is about 5/7 kilometers away 
from the place of occurrence. The presence of both these witnesses, i.e., 
Aamir Khan (given up PW) and Qaisar Rasheed Khan (PW-3), at the time of 
preparation of the inquest report (Ex. CW-5/C) at 07:15 p.m. on 28.06.2017, 
suggests that the FIR had been registered after due consultation and 
deliberation by the complainant and also creates doubt regarding the actual 
time of proceedings of inquest taken by Zafar Fareed S.I. (CW-7)-the 
investigating officer, as they were called by the complainant through a 
telephone call from their respective places, i.e., Faisalabad and Kot Sondha. 
It also suggests that the complainant (PW-1) and Saif Ullah (PW-2) were not 
present when the inquest occurred. Saif Ullah (PW-2) is a resident of Dera 
Malla Singh, and he (PW-2) admitted during cross-examination that: - 
“The distance between Farooqabad and Dera 
Malla Singh is about 7/8 kilometers. --------------
---------------------- When police arrived at the 
place of occurrence Qaiser Khan and Aamir 
Khan had already arrived. Qaiser Rahseed is 
our relative who resides at Kot Sondha. Aamir 
Khan is also our relative. The distance between 
Kot Sondha and place of occurrence is about 
6/7 km.” 
 
 
Qaisar Rasheed Khan (PW-3) deposed that he reached the place 
of occurrence, where the dead body of Shahzad Abdullah was lying in Mirza 
Gafoor Chowk. He identified the dead body before the investigating officer 
during the postmortem examination. He (PW-3) deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“I recorded in my statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C. to 
the effect that I reached at the place of 
occurrence where dead body of Shahzad 

Murder Reference No.241 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No.27767 of 2019 
& P.S.L.A No.41181 of 2019 
 
17
Abdulla laying in the Chowk Mirza Gafoor. 
Confronted with Ex. DB where it is no 
recorded.” 
 
 
Considering all these facts, we have no hesitation in concluding 
that the prosecution has not been able to prove on the record that the incident 
was reported at the time it was claimed to have been recorded and the 
presence of the witnesses at the place of occurrence.  
13. 
 
On perusal of complaint (Ex. PA), FIR (Ex. CW-2/A), it reveals 
that the same was lodged at 07:15 p.m. on 28.06.2017, and postmortem was 
conducted by Dr. Rao Taimoor Hameed Khan (CW-5) on 29.06.2017 at 
06:00 a.m., with a delay of about 10 hours and 45 minutes from the time of 
registration of FIR. The fact, however, remains that the post-mortem 
examination was delayed for ten hours and forty-five minutes. The 
prosecution did not explain the delay in conducting the postmortem 
examination. Dr. Rao Taimoor Hameed Khan (CW-5) deposed during 
examination-in-chief that: - 
“On the same day at 08:00 p.m, a dead body of 
Shahzad Abdullah s/o Abdullah Khan age 
about 50-52 years, male, caste Pathan, was 
brought by Shakeel Ahmed 1777/C and 
Muhammad Asif 1697/C from the police station 
of city Farooqabad, District Sheikhupura, for 
the purpose of autopsy.------------- Complete 
documents from police received at 05:30 A.M 
on 29.06.2017 and autopsy conducted at 06:00 
A.M on 29.06.2017. The death according to 
police papers was occurred on the 28.06.2017 at 
07:15 P.M.” 
During cross-examination, Dr. Rao Taimoor Hameed Khan (CW-5) deposed 
that: - 
“There is no delay on my part for conducting of 
postmortem. As soon as I received police paper 
I started examination.----------In autopsy report 
Ex.CW-5/A, the column of Book Number and 
Serial Number has been crossed. No number 
has been mentioned. I did not initial upon the 
alphabets of L and R in Ex.CW-5/A/1.” 

Murder Reference No.241 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No.27767 of 2019 
& P.S.L.A No.41181 of 2019 
 
18
 
 
As per the postmortem report (Ex. CW-5/A), the time of death 
was mentioned as 07:15 p.m. on 28.06.2017. Dr. Rao Taimoor Hameed 
Khan (CW-5) deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“I signed over the application for conducting 
autopsy/injury sheet Ex. CW-5/B, inquest 
report Ex. CW-5/C, application for conducting 
of postmortem examination Ex.CW-5/D.” 
 
 
The absence of signatures of Dr. Rao Taimoor Hameed Khan 
(CW-5) on the complaint (Ex. PA) and F.I.R (Ex. CW-2/A) led to the 
conclusion that the FIR was recorded with the delay, and the FIR has not 
been registered at the time at which it is claimed to have been recorded. It 
also gets support from the inquest report (Ex. CW-5/C), wherein the 
reference to the documents is not given in the brief history. The court 
observed that even though the inquest report prepared under Section 174 of 
Cr.P.C. is aimed at serving a statutory function, to lend credence to the 
prosecution case, the details of the FIR and the gist of the statement recorded 
during inquest proceedings get reflected in the report. The deposition of Dr. 
Rao Taimoor Hameed Khan (CW-5) reveals that the documents were 
received at 05:30 a.m., and till that time, the complaint (Ex. PA) and F.I.R. 
(Ex. CW-2/A) were not existing. The absence of those details is indicative of 
the fact that the prosecution story was still in an embryo state and had not 
been given any shape and that the first information report came to be 
recorded later on after due deliberation and consultation and was then ante-
timed to provide it with the color of the promptly lodged first information 
report. The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, in the case of “Irshad 
Ahmed  v. The State” (2011 SCMR 1193), held that: - 
“We have further observed that the post-
mortem examination of the dead body of 
Shehzad Ahmed deceased had been conducted 
with a noticeable delay and such delay is 
generally suggestive of a real possibility that 
time had been consumed by the police in 
procuring and planting eye-witnesses and in 
cooking up a story for the prosecution before 
preparing police papers necessary for getting a 

Murder Reference No.241 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No.27767 of 2019 
& P.S.L.A No.41181 of 2019 
 
19
post-mortem examination of the dead body 
conducted.” 
 
 
Admittedly, the incident occurred at Chowk Mirza Ghafoor at 
06:00 p.m. on 28.06.2017. As per the prosecution case and deposed by the 
prosecution witnesses, i.e., Adnan Abdullah Khan (PW-1)-the complainant, 
and Saif Ullah (PW-2), on 28.06.2017 at about 06:00 p.m., they along with 
Shehzad Abdullah Khan (the deceased) and Ejaz Ahmad Khan were 
proceeding towards chowk of Mirza Ghafoor to offer to swing their children 
and when they reached in chowk of Mirza Ghafoor, where the appellant 
along with other accused was present and the incident took place. The reason 
for the presence of prosecution witnesses at the place of occurrence was 
taking their children to offer them swings. Adnan Abdullah Khan (PW-1)-
the complainant deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“I, Saif Ullah pw, Ijaz pw and Shahzad 
deceased have no residence or any place of 
business at the Chowk of Mirza Gaffor.” He 
(PW-1) further deposed during cross-examination, 
“We did not produce the two children before 
the police. The witness volunteered they were 
minors. The name of such children Ibraheem 
Shahzad aged about 5/6 years and second was 
Mariam Bibi aged about 8/10 years. I did not 
bring my children for swings. I did not produce 
the operator of swings before the police to prove 
the fact of existence of swings.” 
Whereas, Saif Ullah (PW-2) deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“I have wife and children. My brother Ijaz also 
has wife and children. My children and the 
children of Ijaz were not with us on the day of 
the occurrence when we were allegedly going to 
swing the children. We did not produce any of 
my family member i.e wife and children before 
the police during investigation to prove the fact 
that on the day of occurrence we really came to 
Farooqabad.” 
The investigating officer (CW-7) deposed during cross-examination that:- 

Murder Reference No.241 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No.27767 of 2019 
& P.S.L.A No.41181 of 2019 
 
20
“There is no mention of the swings and the 
minor children playing in it in my unscaled site 
plan Ex.CW-7/H.------------When I reached at 
the place of occurrence the persons who were 
present there to whom I mentioned in my 
record were majors. I did not refer the children 
to whom the complainant party had brought for 
swings in my entire investigation.” 
 
 
It is admitted that the prosecution witnesses are interested and 
inimical towards the accused. The appellant is the son of co-accused Tariq 
Saif-Ul-Rehman and the brother of Qudrat Ullah Shahab and Junaid Ahmad 
Khan (since acquitted). Adnan Abdullah Khan (PW-1)-the complainant 
deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“About 6 months earlier to the occurrence I 
lodged an FIR 449 dated 17.12.2016 u/s 364 
PPC regarding the abduction of Saif Ullah Pw 
of this case, against Tariq accused and his 
sons.” 
Similarly, Saif Ullah (PW-2) deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“A criminal case was registered against Taha 
accused and his father etc regarding my 
abduction. The said case was registered by the 
complainant of this case. The said case was 
cancelled. The witness volunteered that a 
compromise effected in that case. ----------- I 
cannot produce any document regarding 
compromise today. I did not produce any 
document of that compromise during the 
investigation of this case.” 
 
 
So, all these facts suggest that both the prosecution witnesses, 
i.e., Adnan Abdullah Khan (PW-1)-the complainant, and Saif Ullah (PW-2), 
failed to establish their presence at the place of occurrence. The prosecution 
witnesses were not only inimical towards the accused persons but were also 
closely related to the deceased, and they had reasons to implicate the 
accused persons falsely. During cross-examination, Zafar Fareed S.I. (CW-
7)-the investigating officer deposed that:- 

Murder Reference No.241 of 2019

& P.S.L.A No.41181 of 2019

“I did not the record the statement of minor 
injured 
Muhammad 
Ahmad.-----------The 
witness volunteered that the father of injured 
minor child appeared before the court of 
learned Area Magistrate and recorded his 
statement that they did not want to pursue the 
case. During my investigation on 222.07.2017, it 
was not came before me the complainant party 
was harassing the minor child and his father. 
The witness volunteered that might be due to 
clerical mistake it was stated in my case diaries 
however the father of the minor injured 
appeared before the learned Area Magistrate 
and recorded his statement. The investigation 
remained 
with 
me 
from 
22.07.2017 
to 
10.09.2017. Police file also remained with me 
during the above said period. During this 
period I have been writing and reading the 
police file. I did not correct my any clerical 
mistake.” 
 
 
There is no independent evidence to corroborate the evidence of 
the interested witnesses in this case. 
14. 
 
Per the prosecution case, Zafar Fareed S.I. (CW-7)-the 
investigating officer, deposed that on 28.06.2017, he (CW-7) collected 13 
crimes empties P-1/1-13 of 9MM pistol which were secured from the place 
of occurrence vide recovery memo (Ex. PE) and on the same day he (CW-7) 
handed over a sealed parcel of the 13 crimes empties P-1/1-13 to Nazim 
Hussain 1313/HC (CW-4) for onward transmission to the office of Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency. Nazim Hussain 1313/HC (CW-4) deposed that he 
handed over a sealed parcel of the 13 crimes empties P-1/1-13 to Zafar 
Fareed S.I. (CW-7)-the investigating officer, on 03.07.2017. Zafar Fareed 
S.I. (CW-7)-the investigating officer deposed that on 03.07.2017, he 
received a sealed parcel of the 13 crimes empties P-1/1-13 from Nazim 
Hussain 1313/HC (CW-4) and deposited the same on the same day with the 
office of Punjab Forensic Science Agency.  
 
 
Zafar Fareed S.I. (CW-7)-the investigating officer deposed that 
he arrested Taha Azam Ullah-accused on 14.08.2017. On 24.08.2017, Taha 
Azam Ullah-accused got recovered a pistol 9-MM (P-4) along with two

& P.S.L.A No.41181 of 2019 
 
22
magazines P-5/1-2 and two live bullets P-6/1-2 and on the same day, Zafar 
Fareed S.I. (CW-7)-the investigating officer handed over a sealed parcel of 
the pistol 9-MM (P-4) to Nazim Hussain 1313/HC (CW-4) for onward 
transmission to the office of Punjab Forensic Science Agency. Nazim 
Hussain 1313/HC (CW-4) deposed that he handed over a sealed parcel of the 
pistol 9-MM (P-4) to Zafar Fareed S.I. (CW-7)-the investigating officer on 
29.08.2017, the office of Punjab Forensic Science Agency. Zafar Fareed S.I. 
(CW-7)-the investigating officer deposed that on 29.08.2017, he received a 
sealed parcel of pistol 9-MM (P-4) from Nazim Hussain 1313/HC (CW-4) 
and deposited the same on the same day with the office of Punjab Forensic 
Science Agency. The sealed parcel of case property was handed over to 
Zafar Fareed S.I. (CW-7)-the investigating officer, but he (CW-7) had not 
stated that he received back pistol 9-MM (P-4) and the 13 crimes empties P-
1/1-13 from the office of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore. The 
entire prosecution evidence is silent on this aspect of the case. The whole 
prosecution evidence is silent on this aspect of the case. Thus, there was no 
link evidence to prove that the pistol 9-MM (P-4) recovered from the 
accused and 13 crime empties P-1/1-13 secured from the place of occurrence 
were again received back from Zafar Fareed S.I. (CW-7)-investigating 
officer or any other police officer by the moharrar Malkhana, and the same 
were re-deposited in the Malkhana or handed over to the Moharrar. It is 
necessary that as and when the case property is taken out from Malkhana, 
necessary entry is required to be made in the Malkhana Register and also at 
the time when the case property is re-deposited in Malkhana. Case property 
in murder cases must be kept in safe custody from the date of seizure till its 
production in the Court. On 01.09.2018, 13 crime empties P-1/1-13 and on 
15.11.2018, the pistol 9-MM (P-4) were produced in the testimony of Saif 
Ullah (PW-2) and Ibrar Ahmad (PW-4) respectively. Nazim Hussain 
1313/HC (CW-4) or any other prosecution witness had not stated that they 
collected 13 crime empties P-1/1-13 and pistol (P-4) from the office of 
Punjab Forensic Science Laboratory and re-deposited the same with the 
malkhana.  Thus, it casts doubt whether it is the same case properties i.e. 

Murder Reference No.241 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No.27767 of 2019 
& P.S.L.A No.41181 of 2019 
 
23
pistol (P-4) and crime empties P-1/1-13 respectively, that were recovered 
from the accused and secured from the place of occurrence, and, after that 
sent to Punjab Forensic Science Laboratory or whether it was case property 
of some other case. Pointing out towards above deposition of prosecution 
witnesses, it reveals that the prosecution did not prove that case property 13 
crime empties P-1/1-13 and pistol (P-4) were kept in safe custody. Due to 
the lack of this evidence, it cannot be held that the alleged recovered 13 
crime empties P-1/1-13 and pistol (P-4) were re-deposited in Malkhana, and 
its benefit will go to the accused. Given prosecution evidence, it would be 
taken that there was enough chance of the said contraband being tampered 
with. Zafer Fareed S.I. (CW-7)-investigating officer admitted during cross-
examination that: - 
“I prepared inquest report in accordance with 
law with due care.-----------I collected crime 
empties/cases from the place of occurrence. I 
took into custody the dead body from the place 
of occurrence. I could not enter the detail of 
recoveries made at the spot in column No.22 
and 23 of inquest report due to inadvertence.----
-------I did not inform my superior police officer 
regarding the mistake committed in column 
No.22 and 23.” 
 
 
The case property, i.e., 13 crime empties P-1/1-13 and pistol (p-
4) produced in the court, could not be related to the case property seized 
from the place of occurrence. Therefore, 13 crime empties P-1/1-13 and 
pistol (P-4) might have been tampered with while in the custody of the 
police cannot be ruled out. Thus, there is no evidence to connect the 
Firearms & Toolmarks Examination Report (Ex.PJ) with the 13 crime 
empties P-1/1-13, seized from the place of occurrence and pistol (P-4) 
secured from the possession of the accused. That being the position, it would 
not be safe to rely upon the positive report of the forensic science laboratory 
(Exh.PJ). These combined circumstances only deepen the shadow of doubt 
cast upon the prosecution's case. 
15. 
 
Moreover, we have noted that Dr. Rao Taimoor Khan (CW-5), 
who conducted the postmortem of the dead body of the deceased-Shahzad 

Murder Reference No.241 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No.27767 of 2019 
& P.S.L.A No.41181 of 2019 
 
24
Abdullah, recovered one metallic Bullet from the left lung and handed it 
over to the police. Muhammad Asif 1697/C (CW-3) deposed that: - 
“After conducting the postmortem doctor 
handed over to me postmortem report, last 
worn clothes comprising Shalwar, Qameez, 
Banyan coloured white blood stained and sealed 
box containing metallic bullet which I handed 
over to the I.O of the case.” 
 
 
We have noted that the said metallic body was neither sent to 
the Forensic Science Laboratory for its comparison with the pistol 9-MM (P-
4) recovered at the pointing of the appellant nor the same was exhibited in 
evidence of the prosecution. Thus, it was established from the evidence of 
Muhammad Asif 1697/C (CW-3) and postmortem report (Ex. CW-5/A) that 
Dr. Rao Taimoor Khan (CW-5) recovered the metallic body from the left 
lung of the deceased and handed over to the police, therefore, an adverse 
inference is to be drawn that had the metallic body, been sent to Forensic 
Science Laboratory for its comparison then the said report would have been 
unfavorable to the prosecution.   
16. 
 
The motive set up by the prosecution in the private complaint 
(Exh.PC) and F.I.R. (Exh.PB) and deposed about it by Adnan Abdullah 
(PW-1)-the complainant and Saif Ullah (PW-2) have been found by us to 
have remained un-proved. The prosecution case in this regard was vague and 
could hardly inspire confidence. Adnan Abdullah (PW-1)-the complainant 
deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“I did not state the detail of said property in my 
private complaint. I did not submit any copy of 
ownership alongwith private complaint. We did 
not file any complaint for retrieving possession 
under illegal dispossession Act. The witness 
volunteer some other litigation was pending 
before the court. We did not submit any copy of 
such pending cases alongwith this private case. 
It is incorrect to suggest that my stance of 
pendency of such cases is false. About 15/20 
days earlier to the murder of Shahzad, a 
compromise 
was 
effected 
before 
District

Collector regarding agricultural land left 
between 
the 
accused 
and 
us.----------The 
litigation regarding the case property left by 
Tahir Ishfaq Ur Rehman remained pending for 
about 2 years before the court. During such 
pendency no one from accused side shot fire, 
struck danda or hatchet to any member of my 
family. The witness volunteer that Shahzad 
deceased was received threats. I did not report 
the matter of threats to the police.” 
Saif Ullah (PW-2) deposed during cross-examination that:- 
“The two wives and children of Tahir Ishfaq Ur 
Rehman are alive. None of two wives and 
children of Tahir Ishfaq Ur Rehman witnesses 
in this case to prove the motive of the instant 
case. It is incorrect to suggest that we introduce 
false motive.” 
 
 
Adnan Abdullah (PW-1)-the complainant deposed that after 
15/20 days of the occurrence, a compromise was effected between the 
parties. Per the prosecution case, the occurrence occurred on 28.06.2017. 
The defence relied upon an appeal filed by one Tariq Saif before District 
Collector, Sheikhupura (Ex.DC), partition deed (Ex.DD), wandajat (Ex.DE), 
order dated 11.01.2017 (Ex.DF) passed by District Collector, Sheikhupura 
and order dated 15.02.2017 (Ex.DJ) passed by District Collector, 
Sheikhupura reveals that compromise was effected between the parties on 
11.01.2017 and application for correction of wandajat (Ex.DG) was 
submitted on 17.01.2017, vide order dated 15.02.2017 (Ex.PJ) passed by 
District Collector, Sheikhupura amended compromise was replaced with 
compromise deed 11.01.2017. Rashida Tahir, the widow of Tahir Ishfaq-ur-
Rehman, signed the amended compromise deed and order dated 15.02.2017 
(Ex.PJ). The documentary evidence on the record reveals that no litigation 
was pending between the accused persons and the widow of Tahir Ishfaq-
Ur-Rehman. Zafer Fareed S.I. (CW-7)-the investigating officer admitted 
during cross-examination that he had not interrogated Rashida Tahir, widow 
of Tahir Ishfaq-Ur-Rehman. Zafer Fareed S.I. (CW-7)-the investigating 
officer deposed during cross-examination that: -

“The motive was stated to be the property of 
Rashida Bibi wife of deceased. I did not record 
the statement off Rashida Bibi in support of 
motive part.” 
 
Adnan Abdullah Khan (PW-1)-the complainant deposed during cross-
examination that:- 
“Both wives of Tahir Ishfaq Ur Rehman and his 
children are alive. We did not state any of them 
as my PW. We produced Rashida Bibi my sister 
one of the wife of Tahir Ishfaq Ur Rehman 
during the proceedings before the police.” 
 
 
Therefore, an adverse inference is to be drawn within the 
meaning of Article 129 (g) of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 that had 
Rashida Tahir, widow of Tahir Ishfaq-Ur-Rehman, appeared in the witness 
box would have been unfavorable to the prosecution.  Reliance is placed on 
cases reported as "Lal Khan vs. The State" (2006 SCMR 1846) and “The 
State and others   v.  Abdul Khaliq and others” (PLD 2011 SC 554). In the 
circumstances, we cannot avoid the conclusion that the alleged motive was 
an afterthought and has not been proved by any credible evidence.  
17. 
 
Taking the cumulative effect of the circumstances and the 
testimony of the witnesses into consideration, we believe that the 
prosecution has failed to bring true facts before the court. The prosecution 
could not lead incriminating, corroborative/independent evidence to bring 
home the accused’s guilt in the case of a capital charge. The learned trial 
court was not justified in convicting the appellant while basing upon such 
un-trustworthy, un-corroborated evidence, and the conviction passed by the 
learned trial court in the circumstances is against all cannons of law 
recognized for the dispensation of criminal justice. As per dictates of the 
law, the benefit of every doubt is to be extended in favour of the accused.  In 
the case of “Muhammad Akram  v. The State” (2009 SCMR 230), it has 
been held as under: - 
“The nutshell of the whole discussion is that the 
prosecution case is not free from doubt. It is an 

Murder Reference No.241 of 2019 
Crl. Appeal No.27767 of 2019 
& P.S.L.A No.41181 of 2019 
 
27
axiomatic principle of law that in case of doubt, 
the benefit thereof must accrue in favour of the 
accused as matter of right and not of grace. It 
was observed by this Court in the case of Tariq 
Pervez v. The State 1995 SCMR 1345 that for 
giving the benefit of doubt, it was not necessary 
that there should be many circumstances 
creating doubts. If there is circumstance which 
created reasonable doubt in a prudent mind 
about the guilt of the accused, then the accused 
would be entitled to the benefit of doubt not as a 
matter of grace and concession but as a matter 
of right.” 
  
 
 
It is a golden principle of law that the Court should let off 100 
guilty but not convict one innocent person.  In the case of “Ayub Masih  v.  
The State”  (PLD 2002 SC 1048), it has been held by the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan that:- 
“----It is hardly necessary to reiterate that the 
prosecution is obliged to prove its case against 
the accused beyond any reasonable doubt and 
if it fails to do so the accused is entitled to the 
benefit of doubt as of right. It is also firmly 
settled that if there is an element of doubt as to 
the guilt of the accused the benefit of that 
doubt must be extended to him. The doubt of 
course must be reasonable and not imaginary 
or artificial. The rule of benefit of doubt, which 
is described as the golden rule, is essentially a 
rule of prudence which cannot be ignored while 
dispensing justice in accordance with law. It is 
based on the maxim, “it is better that ten guilty 
persons be acquitted rather than one innocent 
person be convicted”. In simple words it means 
that utmost care should be taken by the Court 
in convicting an accused. It was held in “The 
State  v.  Mushtaq Ahmed” (PLD 1973 SC 418) 
that this rule is antithesis of haphazard 
approach or reaching a fitful decision in a case. 
It will not be out of place to mention here that 
this rule occupies a pivotal place in the Islamic 
law and is enforced rigorously in view of the 
saying of the Holy Prophet (P.B.U.H) that the 
“mistake of Qazi (Judge) in releasing a 
criminal is better than his mistake in punishing 
an innocent”.

18. 
 
The upshot of the above discussion is that the prosecution had 
badly failed to bring home a charge against the appellant beyond any 
reasonable doubt; therefore, in the interest of the safe administration of 
Criminal Justice, Crl. Appeal No.27767 of 2019 filed by Taha Azaam Ullah, 
the appellant is accepted in toto.  The sentence awarded by the learned 
Additional Sessions Judge, Sheikhupura vide judgment dated 30.04.2019, is 
set aside, and the appellant is acquitted of the charge in private complaint 
filed under sections 302, 324, 34 PPC, P.S. City Farooqabad, District 
Sheikhupura titled “Adnan Abdullah vs. Taha Azaam Ullah, etc.” in the 
case of F.I.R. No.129 of 2017 dated 28.06.2017, offence under Sections 302, 
324, 34 PPC registered at Police Station, City Farooq Abad District, 
Sheikhupura. The appellant-Taha Azaam Ullah is ordered to be released 
forthwith if not required in any other case.   
19. 
 
Murder Reference No.241 of 2019 is answered in the 
negative, and the sentence of death awarded to Taha Azaam Ullah son of 
Tariq Saif-ur-Rehman, Caste Pathan, resident of Street Store Wali near Ali 
Baba Centre, Farooqabad Tehsil and District, Sheikhupura (convict) is Not 
Confirmed. 
20. 
 
As far as P.S.L.A No.41181/2019 seeking the conviction of 
respondents Nos.1 to 3, namely Junaid Ahmad Khan, Qudrat Ullah Shahab 
and Tariq Saif-ur-Rehman is concerned, for what has been discussed above 
in the light of prosecution evidence, medical evidence, and documentary 
evidence, the acquittal of respondents Nos.1 to 3 does not suffer from any 
illegality to call for interference of this Court with the impugned judgment. 
This court has also taken note of the settled principle of criminal 
jurisprudence that unless it can be shown that the lower court’s judgment is 
perverse or that it is entirely illegal. No other conclusion can be drawn 
except the guilt of the accused or misreading or non-reading of evidence 
resulting in a miscarriage of justice. Even otherwise, when a court of 
competent jurisdiction acquits the accused, the double presumption of

& P.S.L.A No.41181 of 2019

innocence is attached to his case. The acquittal order cannot be interfered 
with, whereby an accused earns double presumption of innocence as held in 
Muhammad Mansha Kausar v. Muhammad Ashgar and others (2003 
SCMR 477). In this case, the prosecution has not been able to bring on 
record adequate incriminating evidence against respondents Nos.1 to 3, 
which connects them with the alleged crime. The learned trial Judge has 
advanced valid and plausible reasons for recording acquittal in favor of 
respondents Nos.1 to 3. The judgment of acquittal does not call for any 
interference. Consequently, We find no merit in this P.S.L.A No.41181 of 
2019, which is hereby dismissed as being without merits.
