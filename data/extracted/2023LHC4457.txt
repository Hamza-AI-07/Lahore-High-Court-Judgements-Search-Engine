Raheel Kamran J:- The petitioner has assailed the 
order dated 08.12.2020 and order & decree dated 12.01.2021 
passed by the Civil Judge, Pindi Bhattian and judgment and 
decree dated 13.12.2021 passed by the Additional District 
Judge, Pindi Bhattian whereby suit of the petitioners for 
specific performance of agreement to sell was dismissed due to 
non-deposit of remaining sale consideration and appeal 
preferred there-against was also dismissed.  
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that the petitioner instituted a 
suit for specific performance of agreement to sell dated 
05.03.2013 against the respondents stating therein that he 
purchased the disputed property from the respondents against 
the consideration of Rs.8,000,000/- out of which Rs.400,000/- 
was paid as earnest money and it was agreed that after payment 
of remaining consideration of Rs.7,600,000/- on 25.06.2021 the 
disputed property would be transferred in the name of the 
petitioner.  It was further averred in the plaint that despite 

2 
C.R.9463 of 2022 
repeated efforts made on behalf of the petitioner, the 
respondents neither received the remaining consideration nor 
appeared before the Sub-Registrar on the agreed date. The 
respondents appeared and filed contesting written statement 
while controverting the execution of the agreement to sell.  Out 
of the divergent pleadings of the parties, issues were framed 
and partial evidence was recorded.  The trial Court vide order 
dated 08.12.2020 directed the petitioner to deposit the 
remaining sale consideration of Rs.7,600,000/-, which was not 
complied with, hence, the suit was dismissed vide order and 
decree dated 12.01.2021. Appeal preferred there-against by the 
petitioner was also dismissed by the Additional District Judge, 
Pindi Bhattian vide judgment and decree dated 13.12.2021.  
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that since 
the respondents have disputed the execution of agreement to 
sell in question, therefore, the petitioner was not liable to pay 
the remaining sale consideration and the impugned decisions 
are liable to be set aside on this score alone. In support of his 
contentions, he has placed reliance on the case of Professor 
Zia-ur-Rehman Khan and others v. Chairman, WAPDA, 
Lahore and others (2005 SCMR 1133) and Muhammad Asif 
Awan v. Dawood Khan and others (2021 SCMR 1270). 
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondents has 
supported the impugned decisions for the reasons stated 
therein. 
5. 
Heard.  Record perused. 
6. 
Undoubtedly, there is no provision in the Specific 
Relief Act, 1877 requiring the vendee to deposit the remaining 
sale consideration upon filing of the suit for specific 
performance of contract, however, as the relief of specific 
performance is discretionary in nature and cannot be claimed as 

3 
C.R.9463 of 2022 
a matter of right, therefore, the vendee must state that he has 
performed all the conditions which under the agreement he was 
bound to perform and right from the date of execution of the 
agreement till filing of the suit he had been ready and willing to 
perform his part of the contract.  He is not only required to 
state in the plaint his readiness and willingness to perform his 
part of the contract but also establish through supporting 
evidence like pay order, bank statement or other material, his 
ability to perform his part, leaving no doubt in the mind of the 
Court that the proceedings seeking specific performance have 
been initiated to cover up his default or to gain time to generate 
resources.  It is in that context, the Court in order to weigh his 
capacity to perform and intention to purchase may direct the 
vendee to deposit the balance sale consideration.  The readiness 
and willingness on the part of the vendee to perform his part of 
the obligation also prima facie demonstrates that non-
completion of the contract was not the fault of the vendee and 
the contract would have been completed if it has not been 
renounced by the vendor.    
7. 
In this case, after recording oral evidence of the 
plaintiff/petitioner, the trial Court in order to evaluate his bona 
fide and readiness, directed him to deposit the remaining sale 
consideration but he despite availing two opportunities 
remained fail to comply with the said order, rather he moved an 
application for extension of time till decision of the Banking 
Court wherein proceedings involving suit property were 
allegedly pending.  There is no cavil to the proposition that any 
transfer of the property subject matter of proceedings before a 
Banking Court are subject to the provisions of section 23 of the 
Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance, 2001 
and principles governing equity of redemption, however, the 

4 
C.R.9463 of 2022 
same does not absolve a plaintiff seeking specific performance 
of an agreement of his equitable burden to establish readiness 
and willingness to perform his part of the agreement.   
8. 
There are many instances in which though there is 
nothing that actually amounts to fraud, there is nevertheless a 
want of equity and fairness in the contract which are essential 
in order that the Court may exercise its extraordinary 
jurisdiction in specific performance.  In judging of the fairness 
of a contract the Court looks not merely on the terms of the 
contract but all the surrounding circumstances.  Reliance in this 
regard is placed on judgments of the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the cases of Rab Nawaz vs. Mustaqeem Khan (1999 
SCMR 1362) Muhammad Abdul Rehman Qureshi vs. Sagheer 
Ahmad (2017 SCMR 1696). The position that emerges here is 
that specific performance of an agreement dated 05.03.2013 for 
consideration of Rs.8,000,000/- is being sought only after 
paying an amount of Rs.400,000/- as earnest money when the 
value of the property in dispute has multiplied exponentially, as 
claimed by the learned counsel for the respondents while value 
of the Rupee has remarkably depreciated, and that too despite 
failure of the petitioner to deposit the remaining sale 
consideration vide order dated 08.12.2020.  Conduct of the 
petitioner in the instant case manifestly shows non-seriousness 
and unwillingness on his part. Such exercise of jurisdiction 
may lead to miscarriage of justice and unfair advantage to the 
petitioner who, by merely paying a meager amount, had bound 
down the respondents for a number of years.   
9. 
Reliance of the petitioner on the case of Muhammad 
Asif Awan supra is misconceived which is quite distinguishable 
on facts inasmuch as in that case the balance sale consideration 
was deposited in the Court by the vendee with the delay of 

5 
C.R.9463 of 2022 
almost 18 days, however, in the instant case the remaining sale 
price has not been deposited at all.  Moreover, in the afore-
mentioned case, the order directing the deposit of remaining 
sale consideration had not provided penal consequences for 
non-compliance of the same whereas in the instant case the 
trial Court’s order dated 23.12.2020 clearly specified that in 
case of failure to deposit the balance sale price, suit of the 
plaintiff would be dismissed.  The impugned decisions of the 
Courts below are in line with letter and spirit of the law 
enunciated by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of 
Anayat Ullah Khan and others vs. Shabbir Ahmad Khan (2021 
SCMR 686) wherein it has been, inter alia, held in paragraph 
No.15:  
  
“…….. A person seeking the specific performance of a 
contract must first show that he is ready, able and willing 
to perform his obligations under the contract, but this the 
respondent had failed to do.  The law does not require that 
the balance sale consideration must be tendered or 
deposited in court, but such tender/deposit helps establish 
that the buyer was not at fault.  The respondent’s learned 
counsel’s contention that only after the court directs the 
deposit of the sale consideration, is it to be deposited, is 
misplaced.  We may also take judicial notice of the fact that 
invariably the value of money depreciates over time and 
that of land appreciates.  Courts adjudicating such cases 
should not be unmindful of this reality and should 
endeavor to secure the interest of both parties.  In a suit for 
specific performance of land, if the seller/vendor has 
refused to receive the sale consideration, or any part 
thereof, it should be deposited in court and invested in 
some government protected security (such as Defence or 
National Savings Certificates); in case the suit is decreed 
the seller would receive the value of money which 
prevailed at the time of the contract and in case of the 
buyer loses he can similarly retrieve the deposited 
amount.”    
 
10. 
In view of the foregoing, I do not find any illegality or 
material irregularity in the impugned order and judgment of 
both the Courts below warranting interference of this Court in 

6 
C.R.9463 of 2022 
revisional jurisdiction and this civil revision being devoid of 
any merit is accordingly dismissed.  There is no order as to the 
costs.
