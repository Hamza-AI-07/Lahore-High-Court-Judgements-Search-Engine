MASUD ABID NAQVI, J:  Through this writ petition, the 
petitioner has challenged the validity of impugned order dated 
26.03.2024, passed by the learned Election Tribunal whereby the 
Election Appeal filed by respondent No.1 was allowed by setting 
aside order dated 21.03.2024 passed by the Returning Officer, 
PP-32, Gujrat-VI and the nomination papers of respondent No.1 
were accepted.

2. 
At the very outset, learned counsel for the petitioner states 
that the petitioner is aggrieved from the findings of learned 
Election Tribunal in impugned order dated 26.03.2024 to the 
extent of Objections Nos.1, 8, 9, 10 & 11 and is assailing the 
impugned order to that extent. The learned counsel for the 
petitioner argues that in view of the provisions of relevant laws 
and as per Form-B, the respondent No.1 was/is under legal 
obligations to provide complete details of assets whether 
movable or immovable owned by him or his spouse but the 
respondent No.1 deliberately concealed those assets, informed by 
petitioner through fresh/new objections being voter of that 
constituency which were duly discussed by the Returning 
Officer. Hence, the respondent No.1 has not fulfilled the 
eligibility criteria, defined under the relevant laws & Constitution 
of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. In order to strengthen his 
arguments, the learned counsel for the petitioner has relied on 
number of judgments of Honourable Superior Courts for setting 
aside the impugned order. On the other hand, learned counsel for 
the respondent No.1 argues that in the previous two General 
Elections, the respondent No.1 filed nomination papers with the 
same details of assets and few objections on those nomination 
papers were either rejected by the Returning Officer or by the 
learned Election Tribunal, by this Court in writ petition and 
ultimately respondent No.1 contested General Election after the 
judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan passed in 
C.P.No.181 of 2024. Learned counsel for respondent No.1 further 

W.P. No.20729 of 2024

argues that respondent No.1 was arrested and imprisoned even 
before the last General Elections and he is still behind the bars, 
hence, it is not expected from an imprisoned candidate to provide 
all the details of his assets as well as assets of his spouse and the 
assets which have not been mentioned in the nomination papers 
are not of substantial nature. Further argues that in scrutiny 
process of respondent No.1’s nomination papers, the Returning 
Officer miserably failed to proceed under the second proviso to 
Section 62(9) of the Act. Learned counsel for the respondent 
No.1 has also relied on number of judgments of Honourable 
Superior Courts in support of the impugned order. Learned Legal 
Advisor of Election Commission of Pakistan/respondent No.3 
also assisted this Court about certain facts, argued by the 
contesting parties after going through the summoned record. 
Although, learned counsel for the respondent No.1 raised a 
legal question about the jurisdiction of this Court in entertaining 
the instant writ petition by relying on judgments yesterday but 
today he simply argues on the facts & law(s) in support of the 
impugned order while learned counsel for the petitioner as well as 
learned Advisor of Election Commission of Pakistan opposed the 
stance of learned counsel for the respondent No.1 by not only 
relying on judgments but also by drawing our attention to 
previous litigation where the respondent No.1 himself filed a writ 
petition before a Full Bench on this Court. Hence, after hearing 
the arguments of learned counsels and considering the peculiar 

W.P. No.20729 of 2024  
 
4
facts of this litigation, there remains no doubt about the 
jurisdiction of this Court to entertain instant writ petition. 
3. 
We have heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the 
parties and have minutely gone through record as well as the 
impugned order. 
4. 
In recently decided election matters, Honourable Apex 
Court has educatively discussed about the democratic principles, 
duties of Returning Officers in election process and role of Courts 
as guardians of democracy and fundamental rights. Relevant 
portion of those judgments are reproduced hereunder for our 
guidance to decide instant petition; 
C.P.No.151 & 152 of 2024……..Elections stand as a 
manifestation of the collective will of a nation, reflecting 
the diverse voices and choices of its citizens. In this 
democratic process, individuals exercise their right to vote, 
contributing 
to 
the 
formation 
of 
a 
representative 
government. The rights involved are not only of those 
participating in the elections but also of the public. The 
courts, in their role as guardians of democracy and 
fundamental rights, should approach electoral matters with 
circumspection, ensuring that their interventions uphold the 
democratic principles upon which the nation thrives and the 
fundamental rights of citizens to contest elections and vote 
for the candidates of their choice. The right to vote freely for 
the candidate of one’s choice is the essence of a democratic 
society, and any restrictions on that right strike at the 
heart of representative government. The 
working of 
democracy depends on whether the people can decide the 
fate of the elected form of government. It depends on the 
choices that people make in different ways. This choice 
of people cannot be compromised, as their mandate in 

W.P. No.20729 of 2024  
 
5
elections changes the destinies of government. Through the 
electoral process and voting, citizens participate in 
democracy. By voting, citizens take part in the public 
affairs of the country. Thus, citizens by voting enjoy 
their right 
to 
choose 
the 
composition 
of 
their 
government by exercising their choice and ability to 
participate………..electoral laws must be interpreted in favour 
of enfranchisement rather than disenfranchisement so that 
maximum choice remains with the voters to elect their future 
leadership. With this approach rooted in the high 
constitutional rights and values, the courts are to deal with 
the matters of acceptance or rejection of the nomination 
papers filed for contesting elections. 
C.P.No.181 of 2024……..At the heart of a thriving 
democracy lies the fundamental process of elections, an 
embodiment of the democratic principle that power should 
be vested in the hands of the people. And at its core, 
democracy is all about participation. Elections offer a 
structured and equitable way for citizens to participate in 
the democratic process and express their preferences for 
leaders and policies. The legitimacy of a democratic 
government hinges on its reflection of the people's will, and 
this is only possible through widespread and inclusive 
participation of the candidates and voters in the election 
process. Pro-enfranchisement policies ensure that every 
eligible 
citizen, 
irrespective 
of 
his 
or 
her 
background, has the opportunity to vote, thus reinforcing 
the democratic tenet of equal representation. The threat of 
disenfranchisement by way of an improper rejection of 
nomination papers looms large in a democracy, which may 
undermine the fairness and integrity of the electoral 
process. A democratic society committed to fairness must 
actively combat disenfranchisement, ensuring that all voices 
are heard and valued in the political arena. Inclusive 
electoral processes contribute to political stability and social 

W.P. No.20729 of 2024  
 
6
cohesion. This stability is essential for the long-term 
prosperity and peace of any society. The vitality of 
elections in a democracy cannot, therefore, be overstated. 
Further, the right to vote freely for the candidate of one’s 
choice is the essence of a democratic society, and any 
[undue] restrictions on that right strike at the heart of 
representative government. It is with this approach we    deal  
with and decide upon the issues involved in the present 
case………….. Had the petitioner not disputed his 
ownership of the said land, the RO may have directed 
him to mention the same in his statement of assets; as 
the second proviso to Section 62(9) of the Act 
specifically prescribes for the ROs that they should not 
reject any nomination paper on the ground of any defect 
which is not of a substantial nature and may allow 
such defect to be remedied forthwith. These provisions 
show that the law is pro-inclusiveness in the election 
process. The rejection of the nomination paper of the 
petitioner on the said ground also is not legally sustainable. 
C.P.No.183 of 2024…….. It goes without saying that it is 
against democratic norms and principles to add technical 
bottlenecks in the way of any individual, who is a 
citizen of this country, trying to contest elections. And in 
this backdrop, it is pertinent to say that electoral laws and 
rules cannot be used as an arbitrary filtering mechanism, 
dependent on the whims of a Returning Officer. Therefore, a 
Returning Officer should exercise the discretional powers 
available 
to 
him 
in 
a 
rational 
and 
meticulous 
manner……..the Returning Officer must scrutinize all 
nomination papers submitted to him, in the best 
interest of justice and to uphold the fundamental 
right of any individual to contest elections. Returning 
Officers are an integral part of the electoral process and 
it is highly unbecoming of a Returning Officer to 
exercise the authority conferred upon him or her  in a 

W.P. No.20729 of 2024  
 
7
manner 
which 
sabotages 
the 
electoral 
process. 
Returning Officers must remember 
that it is a 
fundamental right of an individual to contest elections 
and if they sabotage an individual not only do they rob 
the individual of their fundamental right but they also 
rob the populace at large of voting for that individual, 
which is also a fundamental right protected by the 
Constitution. 
5. 
In view of the above guidelines of Hon’ble Supreme Court 
of Pakistan and the facts and law, objection-wise findings of this 
Court are as under:- 
(i) 
Objection No.1: There is no denial of the fact that 
the similar objection was raised in previous general election 
which was not held in the year 2023 and the returning 
officer rejected the nomination paper of respondent No.1 
but vide order dated 14.04.2023, learned Election Tribunal 
accepted the respondent No.1’s Election Appeal No.24179 
of 2023 after adjudicating upon all the questions of fact & 
law and that order was not assailed which attained finality. 
The returning officer rejected the respondent No.1’s 
nomination paper without even mentioning the order of 
learned Election Tribunal on the issue. 
 
(ii) 
Objection No.8: Returning officer rejected the 
nomination paper of respondent No.1 due to the non-
disclosure of respondent No.1’s spouse land measuring 08-
kanals 08-marlas in his statement of assets and while 
rejecting the nomination paper, the Returning Officer has not 
exercised his discretional powers available to him in a 

W.P. No.20729 of 2024  
 
8
rational and meticulous manner. It was the duty of 
Returning Officer to scrutinize nomination paper, in the 
best interest of justice and to uphold the fundamental 
right of the individual to contest elections. Instead of 
rejecting the nomination paper, Returning Officer can direct 
the respondent No.1 to mention the same in his statement of 
assets because the second proviso to Section 62(9) of the 
Act specifically prescribes for the Retuning Officers that 
they should not reject any nomination paper on the ground 
of any defect which is not of a substantial nature and may 
allow such defect to be remedied forthwith. 
(iii) 
Objection No.9: Returning officer rejected the 
nomination paper of respondent No.1 due to the non-
disclosure of respondent No.1’s inherited land measuring 
34 kanals 18 marlas in his statement of assets and while 
rejecting the nomination paper, the Returning Officer has not 
exercised his discretional powers available to him in a 
rational and meticulous manner. It was the duty of 
Returning Officer to scrutinize nomination paper, in the 
best interest of justice and to uphold the fundamental 
right of the individual to contest elections. Instead of 
rejecting the nomination paper, Returning Officer can direct 
the respondent No.1 to mention the same in his statement of 
assets because the second proviso to Section 62(9) of the 
Act specifically prescribes for the Retuning Officers that 
they should not reject any nomination paper on the ground 

W.P. No.20729 of 2024  
 
9
of any defect which is not of a substantial nature and may 
allow such defect to be remedied forthwith. 
(iv). Objection No.10: Returning officer rejected the 
nomination paper of respondent No.1 due to the non-
disclosure of respondent No.1’s weapons in his statement of 
assets. There is no column in election form where a 
candidate can give the details of his weapons but the value 
of these weapons are duly disclosed/ mentioned in 
statement of assets. 
(v) 
Objection No.11: There is no bar for a candidate to 
participate in the election as an independent candidate or to 
participate with certificate of a party being a party’s 
candidate.  
6. 
For the foregoing reasons, we are of the view that the 
learned Election Tribunal has exhaustively dealt with matter and 
the petitioner has miserably failed to substantiate his case by 
giving valid grounds for setting aside the impugned order dated 
26.03.2024. Consequently, finding no merit in this petition, the 
same is dismissed.
