This and connected Income Tax Reference 
Application 
No. 
2683/2023 
are 
directed 
against 
consolidated order dated 02.12.2021 of learned Appellate 
Tribunal Inland Revenue, Lahore, whereby appeals 
preferred by Taxpayer, relating to Tax Years 2014 and 
2015, were allowed. And appeal preferred by the 
department, 
bearing 
ITA 
No.3825/LB/2018, 
was 
dismissed. 
2. 
Following questions of law, statedly arising out of 
the judgment, with respect to allowance of appeals of the 
taxpayer, are proposed for our consideration. 
(i). Whether charging of Minimum tax under 
Section 113 of the Ordinance at the prescribed rate 
absolves the taxpayer from being charged tax on 
Income from Property generated by the taxpayer, 
especially in the circumstances when the taxpayer 
meets the prescribed requirements laid down by 
Section 15 and 15A? 
 
(ii). Whether the tax charged on Income From 
Property under Section 15 read with Section 15A is 
liable to the be charged separately from Minimum 
Tax, since Minimum Tax regime as envisaged in 
Section 113, as well as the definition of “Turnover” 
therein, is restricted to the head “Income from 
Business” only?”  
 
 
3. 
Questions framed are in form of narrative and need 
re-casting for the sake of clarity. Re-casted question of 

                                      I.T.R. No. 2590 of 2023

law, arising out of the judgment of the Appellate 
Tribunal reads as, 
Whether rental income from the property under 
section 15 of the Ordinance of 2001, subject to the 
fulfilment of the conditions prescribed for charging 
of Minimum tax under Section 113 of the 
Ordinance, qualifies as taxpayer‟s gross receipts 
for the purposes of turnover for computing 
Minimum tax for the tax year 2014 and 2015? 
 
4. 
Learned counsel contends that Appellate Tribunal 
failed to distinguish amongst various heads of income, 
for the purposes of computation of minimum tax liability, 
which erroneously taxed Income from property under 
Section 113 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001. Adds 
that income from property, identified under section 15 
Part-III of Chapter-III of the Ordinance, 2001, must be 
treated as separate head of income, and needed to be 
taxed independent of the minimum tax regime. 
5. 
Learned counsel is confronted with the text of 
section 113 of the Ordinance, 2001, as applicable for the 
relevant tax years, and asked to explain how income from 
property is construed to have had been excluded, from 
being considered for the purposes of computation of 
minimum tax, provided the conditions prescribed under 
section 113 are met. Learned counsel states that rental 
income raised from the property does not form part of the 
turnover of taxpayer but comes within separate head of 
income. 
6. 
Submissions are misconceived. Textual reading of 
section 113 of Ordinance, 2001 does not support the 
viewpoint advocated. Income from property may be 

                                      I.T.R. No. 2590 of 2023

classified as income under one of the different heads of 
income but not otherwise specifically excluded for the 
purposes of computation of minimum tax; provided 
benchmarks under section 113 are otherwise met. 
Learned counsel failed to convince us that how income 
from property be brought within the exclusions provided 
through Explanation to sub-section (1) of section 113 of 
the Ordinance, 2001 - inserted through the Finance Act, 
2012. It is expedient to reproduce the Explanation to 
section 113, which reads as, 
Section 113(1) Explanation-1 [Before being substituted by 
the Finance Act, 2016]: 
 
Explanation-For the purpose of this sub-section, 
the expression “tax payable or paid” does not 
include tax already paid or payable in respect of 
deemed income which is assessed as final 
discharge of the tax liability under section 169 or 
under any other provision of this Ordinance.” 
 
[Emphasis supplied] 
 
7. 
It is not the case of the department that income 
under reference was classifiable as deemed income, being 
otherwise assessed as final discharge of tax liability 
under section 169, or any other provision of the 
Ordinance, 2001. Appellate Tribunal, for the purposes of 
Tax Year 2014, deleted the liability of minimum tax 
charged, and applied tax on income, inclusive of income 
from property, which computation of tax was more than 
the benchmark set for triggering minimum tax regime. 
And for the Tax Year 2015, Appellate Tribunal deleted 
tax separately charged on income from property, upon 
finding that cumulative component of tax payable was 

                                      I.T.R. No. 2590 of 2023

lesser than the benchmark provided for attracting 
minimum tax regime. Legislative intent cannot be 
defeated by effecting exclusion of income from property, 
otherwise calculable as part of gross receipts for the 
purposes of turnover under section 113 of the Ordinance, 
2001. It is pertinent to mention that meaning of turnover, 
in sub-section (3) of section 113 of the Ordinance, 2001, 
underwent change, wherein addition of express ‘gross 
sales’ was made. Gross receipts needed to be read in 
conjunction with sub-section (1) of section 113, 
„……person‟s turnover from all sources for that year:‟. 
Gross receipts include income from non-sales sources, 
and nor necessarily related to regular business activity. 
Expression ‘gross sales’ and ‘gross receipts’, employed 
in clause (a) of sub-section (3) of section 113 have had to 
be construed accordingly – to give effect to the changes 
made in the definition of turnover. Term ‘gross receipts’ 
cannot be confined to activity connected with sales of 
goods, when such activity of sale of goods is catered 
through expression ‘gross sales’ – added by Finance Act, 
2011. It is expedient to reproduce clause (a) of sub-
section (3) of section 113 of the Ordinance, 2001, 
(3) -turnover means -  
a) the gross sales or gross receipts, exclusive of Sales Tax 
and Federal Excise duty or any trade discounts shown on 
invoices, or bills, derived from the sale of goods, and also 
excluding any amount taken as deemed income and is 
assessed as final discharge of the tax liability for which tax 
is already paid or payable;

8. 
Addition of the expression „gross sales‟ in 
definition of turnover through Finance Act 2011 renders 
the ratio settled in the case of „COMMISSIONER OF 
INCOME TAX LEGAL DIVISION, LAHORE and others 
v. KHURSHID AHMAD and others‟ (PLD 2016 
Supreme 
Court 
545) 
inapplicable. 
Addition 
of 
expression ‘gross sales’ in fact, distinguishes and 
enlarges the scope and compass of „gross receipts. 
Expression „gross receipts‟ needs to be construed and 
read disjunctively, while distinguishing it from activity of 
sale of goods, simplicitor. Evidently, coupling of 
expression ‘gross receipts’ exclusively with activity of 
sale of goods would render the expression ‘gross sales’ 
redundant, superfluous and have an effect of narrowing 
down the base of income for the purposes of Minimum 
tax regime. In the case of KHURSHID AHMAD and 
others‟ 
(supra) 
expression 
‘gross 
receipts’ 
was 
interpreted when expression ‘gross sales’ was not added 
to the definition of turnover. [‘gross sales’ was added to 
definition of turnover through Finance Act, 2011]. 
Hence, in view of the above, rental income from property 
is not the deemed income and have had to be reckoned 
for the purposes of considering benchmark for Minimum 
tax regime. No illegality was committed by learned 
Appellate Tribunal, while allowing appeals preferred by 
the taxpayer.
