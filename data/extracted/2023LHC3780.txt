    JUDGMENT 
 
Dates of 
Hearing: 
10.06.2021, 26.01.2023, 02.02.2023, 
02.03.2023 and 28.04.2023 
Petitioner by: 
Ch. Rashid Abdullah, Advocate. 
Respondent 
No.1 by: 
Mr. Sajjad Ahmad Joiya, Advocate.  
 
 
 
Anwaar Hussain, J:  This single judgment shall decide 
the present as well as the connected constitutional petitions, listed in 
Schedule „A‟ of this judgment. These petitions have been filed by 
different individuals against the same private respondent, namely, 
Zeeshan Nawaz (hereinafter referred to as “the respondent/ 
landlord”) who filed separate eviction petitions against the 
petitioners. The eviction petitions were accepted and separate appeals 
preferred by the petitioners were also dismissed.  
2.  
The rented premises forming subject matter of the present 
petitions are shops having different numbers, forming part of property 
bearing No. BVII-612-613 known as Chashma Market situated in 
Main Bazar, Daska (hereinafter referred to as “the building” and the 
shops are referred to as “the rented premises”). Applications of the 
petitioners for leave to contest were allowed wherein they all denied 
relationship of landlord and tenant by taking a common plea/defence 
that they are occupying their respective rented premises, under one 
Suleman Shahid s/o Shahid Iqbal and not the respondent/landlord and 
are paying rent regularly to him. This common defence was discarded 

Writ Petition No.31543/2021 
 
2
by the learned Special Judge (Rent), Daska (“the learned Rent 
Tribunal”) and the eviction petitions of the respondent/landlord were 
accepted. Appeals preferred by the petitioners met the same fate and 
hence, the constitutional petitions have been filed reiterating the same 
common plea that the petitioners are tenants under Suleman Shahid. 
The final orders passed by the learned Rent Tribunal in all the cases 
are even dated i.e., 28.01.2021 that have been upheld in appeals by 
judgments of even date i.e., 27.02.2021 passed by the learned 
Additional District Judge, Daska. Since common defence and 
identical question of law is involved in these petitions, therefore, the 
same are being decided through this single judgment. For facility of 
reference in this judgment, source file is taken as that of the present 
constitutional petition.   
3. 
On behalf of the petitioners, the arguments were initially put 
forth by Malik Abdul Wahid, Advocate when the matter was heard on 
multiple dates of hearing but he could not conclude the arguments due 
to his illness and gave „No Objection Certificate‟ to Ch. Rashid 
Abdullah, Advocate who reiterated the arguments advanced by the 
former and concluded the submissions on 28.04.2023. Ch. Rashid 
Abdullah, Advocate submits that the learned Rent Tribunal as well as 
the learned Appellate Court below have erred in appreciating the fact 
as there was no tenancy between the petitioners and the 
respondent/landlord, inasmuch as earlier, separate applications, under 
Section 5 of the Punjab Rented Premises Act, 2009 (hereinafter 
referred to as “the Act”) for registration of the tenancy agreements in 
respect 
of 
the 
rented 
premises, 
moved 
by 
father 
of 
respondent/landlord, namely, Muhammad Nawaz, against the 
petitioners and/or their predecessors-in-interest, were dismissed by the 
learned Rent Tribunal, vide orders of even date 26.07.2017 as the 
petitioners and/or their predecessors-in-interest denied relationship of 
landlord and tenant and the learned Rent Tribunal refused to register 

Writ Petition No.31543/2021 
 
3
the agreement against which appeals were preferred and the learned 
Appellate Court below also dismissed the same, vide orders of even 
date 02.12.2017 where after no further challenge was laid; hence, the 
said findings have attained finality and therefore, the jurisdiction of 
the learned Rent Tribunal could not have been invoked by filing 
eviction petitions merely on the basis of an observation of the learned 
Appellate Court below in order dated 02.12.2017 that the 
respondent/landlord has equitable right to seek eviction of the 
petitioners. Further submits that the petitioners and/or their 
predecessor-in-interest were inducted as tenants by one Shahid Iqbal 
to whom the petitioners were regularly paying the rent and after his 
death, rent is being regularly paid to his son, namely, Suleman Shahid. 
Adds that the respondent/landlord has no title to the rented premises, 
on the basis of which he can seek eviction of the petitioners, under the 
applicable law. Further avers that the learned Courts below erred in 
treating the Family Settlement (خانگی تقسیم), dated 16.02.1999 
(hereinafter referred as “the Family Settlement”) which is a disputed 
document to have conferred status of owner upon the respondent/ 
landlord and cannot be made basis of eviction of the petitioners. 
Lastly, submitted that there is civil litigation pending between the 
respondent/landlord and Suleman Shahid regarding the title of the 
rented premises and this aspect of the matters has not been 
appreciated by the learned fora below.  
4. 
Conversely, Mr. Sajjad Ahmad Joiya, Advocate, learned 
counsel for the respondent/landlord submits that the rented premises 
in-fact are part of the building that is an ancestral property belonging 
to grandfather of the respondent/landlord and Suleman Shahid that 
initially devolved upon three brothers, namely, Shahid Iqbal, 
Muhammad Nawaz and Imtiaz Ahmad and the same comprises of 
total 46 shops. Out of the said 46 shops, Shahid Iqbal, who was father 
of Suleman Shahid, under whom the petitioners claim to be the 
tenants, got his share in form of Shops No.1 to 15 whereas father of 

Writ Petition No.31543/2021 
 
4
the 
respondent/landlord, 
namely, 
Muhammad 
Nawaz 
was 
acknowledged and accepted as owner of Shops No.16 to 32 that are 
the numbers of the rented premises forming subject matter of the 
present petitions and the third brother, namely, Imtiaz Ahmad was 
acknowledged as owner pertaining to the remaining shops i.e., Shops 
No.33 to 46, under the Family Settlement, where-after Shahid Iqbal 
transferred his share to his wife namely, Nusrat Iqbal. Explaining the 
factual matrix of the case, learned counsel further avers that after 
executing the Family Settlement, Muhammad Nawaz, Imtiaz Ahmad 
and Nusrat Iqbal appointed Shahid Iqbal as their attorney, who used to 
manage the affairs of the building as a whole and executed various 
written as well as oral tenancy agreements including agreements with 
the petitioners and/or their predecessor-in-interest, however, the said 
attorney was revoked and it is in this factual background that the 
predecessor-in-interest of the respondent/landlord Muhammad Nawaz 
sought regularization of the written and/or oral tenancies in terms of 
Section 5 of the Act and upon denial of relationship of landlord and 
tenant by the petitioners, eviction proceedings were rightly initiated 
by the respondent/landlord against the petitioners. Further contends 
that the petitioners before this Court could not deny the relationship of 
landlord and tenant as Suleman Shahid, whom the petitioners are 
treating to be the owner of the rented premises, claimed ownership on 
the basis of an agreement to sell only that was executed by his 
deceased father namely, Shahid Iqbal, as attorney of Muhammad 
Nawaz and said power of attorney had been admittedly revoked. 
Further avers that civil litigation was also initiated by Suleman 
Shahid, on the strength of said agreement to sell, however, during the 
pendency of the proceedings before this Court, in present petitions, 
the suit instituted by Suleman Shahid has also been dismissed. 
Concludes that the Family Settlement is duly acknowledged by 
Suleman Shahid as he relied upon the Family Settlement in his claim 
before the learned Civil Courts, therefore, neither the petitioners, who 

Writ Petition No.31543/2021 
 
5
are admittedly occupying the rented premises as tenants, nor Suleman 
Shahid, can deny the genuineness of the Family Settlement.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
6. 
The present as well as connected cases have a chequered history 
and raise a common question of law that is based on the identical plea 
of the petitioners on the strength of which the cases have been 
strenuously argued before this Court that once the applications of the 
predecessor-in-interest of the respondent/landlord, under Section 5 of 
the Act, for regularization/registration of the tenancies with the 
petitioners, were dismissed, on denial of relationship of landlord and 
tenant by the petitioners, and the said orders attained finality after 
being upheld, the learned Rent Tribunal had no jurisdiction to 
entertain the eviction petitions filed by the respondent/landlord. 
Therefore, the common legal question, in these cases, that requires 
opinion of this Court boils down to as under: 
Whether the Rent Tribunal is precluded from 
entertaining an application for ejectment of a 
tenant if an earlier application of the ejectment 
petitioner, for registration of tenancy agreement, 
under Section 5 of the Act has been dismissed by 
the Rent Registrar on the basis of denial of 
relationship of landlord and tenant? 
 
7. 
Before answering the legal question and examining the merits 
of the case, it is imperative to highlight admitted features of the case. 
There is no denial that the rented premises form part of the building 
that is ancestral property as explained by the respondent side and 
consists of total 46 shops. The petitioners are occupying Shop Nos.16 
to 32 and in their respective applications for leave to appear and 
contest before the learned Rent Tribunal, they have raised the 
common defence that they are in occupation of the said shops for the 
last few years under deceased Shahid Iqbal and after the demise of 
Shahid Iqbal, they are holding the rented premises as tenants under his 

Writ Petition No.31543/2021 
 
6
son Suleman Shahid. It is also admitted feature of the case that it is 
the second round of litigation, before this Court, in respect of the 
rented premises. In the earlier round of litigation, the matter was 
remanded on the basis of a compromise between the parties, vide 
order dated 22.05.2013 passed in W.P No.3041/2010 titled “Ijaz 
Ahmad v. Muhammad Imtiaz, etc.”. In the said round, deceased 
Shahid 
Iqbal 
represented 
predecessor-in-interest 
of 
the 
respondent/landlord, namely, Muhammad Nawaz, as the attorney of 
the latter and once the matter was remanded and the power of attorney 
in favour of deceased Shahid Iqbal was revoked, the deceased 
Muhammad Nawaz filed the applications for regularization/ 
registration of the written and/or oral tenancy agreements with the 
petitioners, who denied the relationship of landlord/tenant between the 
parties and the said applications were dismissed, vide order dated 
26.07.2017, in the following terms: 
“Furthermore, the attorney of the applicant namely 
Shahid Iqbal entered into an agreement to sell with one 
Suleman Shahid regarding the rented shop and in this 
regard a suit for specific performance of agreement to 
sell is still pending adjudication. Furthermore, another 
suit for possession through partition and rendition of 
accounts titled as “Muhammad Nawaz Vs Shahid Iqbal 
etc.” has not yet been finally decided. Private/family 
partition is always subject to legal partition. There is no 
denial to the fact that the respondent was the tenant of 
Shahid Iqbal and he had been paying rent to him. There 
is no document on the file to even suggest that the 
applicant had ever received any rent from the 
respondent. Civil litigation regarding title is pending 
adjudication. Relationship of landlord and tenant is not 
yet established from the available record. In view of the 
above circumstances, the applicant remained fail to put 
forward a good case for registration of tenancy 
agreement. Resultantly, this application for registration 
of the tenancy agreement is dismissed being without 
merits.”

When appeals were preferred by predecessor-in-interest of the 
respondent/landlord, the learned Appellate Court below, vide order 
dated 02.12.2017, held as under: 
“10. Peculiar facts of the case are that appellant 
`appointed Shahid Iqbal, his brother, as agent vide Power 
of Attorney dated 11.03.1999 which was terminated by 
way of cancellation deed dated 24.08.2004. Right after 
cancellation of Power of Attorney, the agency came to an 
end and thereafter any act of agent namely Shahid Iqbal 
on the strength of General Attorney dated 11.03.1999 is 
ab anitio void and inoperative on the rights of the 
appellant/petitioner. 
Notwithstanding 
plea 
of 
the 
respondent that he has been paying annual rent to the 
agent namely Iqbal Shahid & Suleman Shahid does not 
absolve himself from the liability to make payment of 
rent/mesne profit to the owner of property as relationship 
of Shahid Iqbal came to an end on termination of general 
attorney on 24.08.2004. Tenant should have awakened 
himself so as to eschew future problem and should have 
made payment to the owner and not to the terminated 
agent. This is for the benefit of the respondent to stop 
making payment to the terminated agent and he may start 
making payment to actual owner. The appellant has 
equitable right to evict the occupant who is the erstwhile 
tenant of his agent, if any, under the rented Premises Act 
but by the handle of plenary jurisdiction of learned Civil 
Court and can claim all arrears due in shape of claiming 
mesne profit. The appellant/petitioner may also claim 
previous rent received by the terminated agent in shape 
of mesne profits. However, this Court is of the vivid view 
that the learned Special Judge (Rent), Daska passed the 
impugned order on solid reasoning which does not call 
for any interference by this Appellate Court and the same 
is hereby upheld.”  
(Emphasis supplied)  
The refusal of the learned Special Judge (Rent), Daska in his capacity 
as the Rent Registrar to register the tenancy agreement, under Section 
5 of the Act and the above quoted observation in order dated 
02.12.2017 of the learned Appellate Court below is the foundation of 
the common legal question that has been formulated in para 6 of this 
judgment.   

Writ Petition No.31543/2021

8. 
Adverting to the legal question, it is imperative to examine the 
nature of an order passed under Section 5 of the Act that relates to the 
registration of a tenancy agreement and reads as under:  
“5. Agreement between landlord and tenant.-(1) 
A landlord shall not let out a premises to a tenant except 
by a tenancy agreement.  
(2) 
A landlord shall present the tenancy 
agreement before the Rent Registrar. 
(3) 
The Rent Registrar shall enter the particulars 
of the tenancy in a register, affix his official seal on the 
tenancy agreement, retain a copy thereof and return the 
original tenancy agreement to the landlord.  
(4) 
The entry of particulars of the tenancy shall 
not absolve the landlord or the tenant of their liability to 
register the tenancy agreement under the law relating to 
registration of documents. 
(5) 
A tenancy agreement entered in the office of 
a Rent Registrar or a certified copy thereof shall be a 
proof of the relationship of landlord and tenant. 
(6) 
Any agreement which may be executed 
between the landlord and the tenant in respect of the 
premises shall be presented before the Rent Registrar in 
the same manner as provided in sub-section (2).” 
 
The power to register a tenancy agreement lies with the learned 
Special Judge (Rent) in his capacity as the Rent Registrar who is 
required to enter the particulars of the tenancy in a register, affix his 
seal on the tenancy agreement and retain a copy thereof. 
Consequently, the functions of the Rent Registrar are limited to the 
registration of the tenancy agreement. The Rent Registrar, however, is 
obligated not to carry out such functions mechanically and may 
require „prima facie proof of ownership‟ from the landlord. Reference 
in this regard is made to case reported as “Sayyed Mohammad Areeb 
Abdul Khafid Shah Bukhari v. Government of the Punjab and others” 
(PLD 2018 Lahore 390) wherein it has been held as under: 

Writ Petition No.31543/2021 
 
9
“9.....From the perusal of Sections 5, 6 coupled with 
Section 2 (d) of the Act, the landlord means the owner of 
premises and includes a person for the time being entitled 
or authorized to receive rent in respect of the premises, as 
such, it is mandatory for a person claiming to be the 
landlord to provide any prima facie proof of ownership or 
any authorization from the owner in recognition of his 
being ostensible landlord qua the rented premises to the 
Rent Registrar for registration of the rent agreement and 
the Rent Registrar is also competent to ask the landlord 
for production of any proof regarding the ownership or 
title document of the demised premises. Even a person 
who files application under Section 5 of the Act for 
registration of rent agreement on behalf of the landlord is 
also under obligation to provide a reasonable proof of 
ownership of the landlord for the purpose of registration 
of rent agreement which is not tantamount to decision of 
the title rather it is only satisfaction of the Rent 
Registrar for the purpose of the registration of the 
document of rent agreement.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
The Rent Registrar is also required to follow due process and issue 
notice to the tenant before registering the tenancy agreement. 
Reference in this regard is made to case reported as “Wajid Ali v. Rent 
Registrar/Special Judge Rent, Lahore and another” (PLD 2010 
Lahore 463).  
9. 
However, despite the foregoing, the functions of the Rent 
Registrar, at the best, only involve a prima facie scrutiny of the title of 
the landlord. The Rent Registrar can only carry out a tentative probe 
viz., the status of the parties as held in case of Sayyed Mohammad 
Areeb Abdul Khafid Shah Bukhari supra and does not have the 
authority and power to conclusively determine the issue of the status 
of the parties since the said power is judicial in nature and lies with 
the learned Rent Tribunal as the law creates a distinction between the 
functions and powers of the learned Special Judge (Rent) while 
functioning as Rent Registrar and in its capacity as the Rent Tribunal 
inasmuch as the learned Rent Tribunal has the power to entertain and 

Writ Petition No.31543/2021 
 
10 
adjudicate applications in respect of the rented premises in terms of 
Section 19 of the Act and has exclusive jurisdiction in respect of cases 
arising under the Act as contemplated under Section 16(4) thereof that 
includes applications for deposit of rent, eviction of tenant etc., 
whereas, the Rent Registrar only receives applications for registration 
of the tenancy agreements in terms of Section 5 of the Act and his sole 
responsibility is to maintain a register to enter particulars of tenancy 
agreements, agreement to sell or any other agreement in respect of 
rented premises as per Section 17(2) of the Act. Similarly, under 
Section 25 of the Act, the learned Rent Tribunal has the power to 
record evidence, however, no such power vests with the Rent 
Registrar. Moreover, the learned Rent Tribunal exercises powers of 
the Civil Court by virtue of Section 26 of the Act whereas no such 
powers are available to the Rent Registrar.  
10. 
In nutshell, it is well evident from the above discussion that the 
Rent Registrar does not perform an adjudicatory function rather 
performs functions that are primarily administrative/executive in 
nature, which may require cursory appreciation of the documents and 
tentative probe viz., status of the parties. The learned Rent Tribunal, 
on the other hand, has exclusive adjudicatory powers for all the 
matters related to rented premises and therefore, also the power to 
make a final determination in respect of the issues such as the status 
of the parties. So even if the functions of the Rent Registrar and the 
Rent Tribunal are entrusted to the same Officer (Judicial Officer), the 
above distinction will remain true as each role has its own scope and 
limitations. As is clear, under the Act, the Rent Registrar has very 
limited functions and powers that are not adjudicatory in nature, this 
Court is of the opinion that the distinction between the functions and 
powers of the Rent Tribunal and the Rent Registrar have been 
deliberately and consciously incorporated in the Act and one cannot 
lose sight of the same while deciding the fate of an eviction petition.  

Writ Petition No.31543/2021

11. 
The matter can be examined from another angle. Under Section 
9 of the Act, it has been clearly envisaged that if a tenancy does not 
comply with the requirements of the Act, an application under the Act 
can be entertained by the learned Rent Tribunal provided that the 
requisite fine is deposited with the learned Rent Tribunal. The word 
„entertain‟ in legal parlance, as per Black‟s Law Dictionary, Tenth 
Edition, means „to give judicial consideration to‟ a matter. Similarly, 
in case reported as “Mst. Alhamdi Begum v. National Bank of 
Pakistan, Karachi and 2 others” (PLD 1976 Karachi 723), it has been 
defined as „to adjudicate upon‟ or „proceed‟ to consider on merits. It 
is amply clear that even if the tenancy agreement is not registered 
under Section 5 of the Act, the same does not operate as an absolute 
bar on the learned Rent Tribunal from entertaining an application 
under the Act provided the requisite fine is paid. It is important to note 
that the words used in Section 9 are “if a tenancy does not conform to 
the provisions of this Act”. Meaning thereby that if, for whatsoever 
reason, the tenancy agreement is not registered with the Rent 
Registrar under Section 5 (whether due to landlord‟s failure to get the 
same registered or the Rent Registrar‟s refusal to register the same on 
denial of relationship by the tenant), Section 9 will become applicable 
and the application before the Rent Tribunal can still be entertained, 
after payment of the requisite fine. At this juncture, it is also 
imperative to observe that the legal question can be analyzed from yet 
another angle. If an order to register the tenancy agreement was to 
preclude the powers of a Rent Tribunal under Section 9 and Section 
19 of the Act, then there ought to have been clear language in the 
statute to this effect. However, neither Section 9 nor Section 19 of the 
Act, makes the exercise of powers by the learned Rent Tribunal 
subject to any prior determination, under Section 5 of the Act. In the 
absence of any such language, the order passed under Section 5 by the 
Rent Registrar cannot be deemed to have the effect of limiting the 
jurisdiction of the learned Rent Tribunal in any manner as such 

Writ Petition No.31543/2021 
 
12 
jurisdiction of the Rent Tribunal includes the power to decide the 
existence or otherwise of relationship of landlord and tenant. 
Moreover, the decision refusing a request to register a tenancy under 
Section 5 of the Act, whether oral or written, cannot be termed as a 
„decision‟ on merits since the same is not made after recording of any 
evidence or framing of issues but the rejection of the application is 
based on a prima facie view of the existence of a tenancy by the Rent 
Registrar. Thus, this Court cannot countenance the argument that 
order under Section 5 made in exercise of administrative functions of 
the learned Special Judge (Rent) precludes the exercise of his judicial 
functions under the Act. 
12. 
Having held that refusal of the Rent Registrar, under the Act, to 
register the tenancy agreement or reduce an oral tenancy into writing, 
does not preclude the learned Rent Tribunal from entertaining a 
landlord‟s application for ejectment of tenant, this Court adverts to the 
merits of the case to opine whether the respondent/landlord was able 
to prove the relationship of landlord and tenant with the petitioners in 
respect of the rented premises in occupation of the petitioners, 
respectively. Admittedly, the petitioners are not claiming any 
ownership of the rented premises and have merely stated that they are 
tenants under Suleman Shahid. Learned counsel for the petitioners 
laid emphasis on the point that the Family Settlement on the basis of 
which the predecessor-in-interest of the respondent/landlord (deceased 
Muhammad Nawaz) claimed ownership of the rented premises is a 
disputed document having no evidentiary value. In this regard, it has 
been noted that the petitions were not properly documented when the 
same were filed but later on, both sides submitted civil miscellaneous 
applications, in present as well as connected petitions, to bring on 
record all the relevant documents that were available before the 
learned Courts below. The said C.Ms. have been allowed vide order of 
even date i.e., 28.04.2023 as no objection was raised from either side. 
These documents include copy of written statement filed by deceased 

Writ Petition No.31543/2021 
 
13 
Shahid Iqbal in suit titled “Muhammad Nawaz v. Shahid Iqbal, etc.”. 
The said written statement clearly depicts that the Family Settlement 
by virtue of which Muhammad Nawaz, predecessor-in-interest of the 
respondent/landlord obtained the ownership rights of the rented 
premises is duly acknowledged in the civil suit instituted by 
Muhammad Nawaz against Shahid Iqbal (Father of purported landlord 
of the petitioners namely, Suleman Shahid) and others and this aspect 
was appreciated by the learned fora below. Upon confrontation by this 
Court, these documents have not been controverted by learned counsel 
for the petitioners. The Family Settlement gets further traction when 
on the strength of the same, admittedly the shops which forms part of 
the building and given to deceased Shahid Iqbal were transferred by 
the deceased Shahid Iqbal to his wife Nusrat Iqbal and the latter along 
with other beneficiary of the Family Settlement namely, Muhammad 
Imtiaz as well as predecessor-in-interest of the respondent/landlord 
executed a general power of attorney in favour of the deceased Shahid 
Iqbal who managed the affairs of the building as a whole including the 
prosecution of litigation before this Court, inter alia, W.P 
No.3041/2010. Therefore, this Court is of the opinion that it does not 
even lie in the mouth of the purported landlord of the petitioners 
namely, 
Suleman 
Shahid 
to 
object 
to 
the 
title 
of 
the 
respondent/landlord let alone the petitioners. The learned Rent 
Tribunal has correctly summarized the evidentiary resume of the case 
in the following terms:-  
“15. Perusal of record reveals that applicant has relied 
upon Ex-A7 a certified copy of an ejectment petition 
dated 21.01.2008 in which the respondent submitted his 
leave to contest and admitted Muhammad Nawaz as 
attorney of Shahid Iqbal. In view of the above mentioned 
oral account as well as the documentary proofs, 
alongwith orders of the Hon'ble Lahore High Court, 
Lahore Mark-A, there remains no doubt or ambiguity that 
tenant was in possession of the disputed premises 
through a written agreement/Ex-A.3 and in view of 
multiple admissions on part of the tenant/respondent, and 

Writ Petition No.31543/2021 
 
14 
other documentary proof provided by the applicant 
including Mark-E/the family settlement deed, PT-1 and a 
decree of the court/Mark-F, applicant has proved himself 
not only owner of the disputed rented premises but also 
that he is the real landlord of the property and upon 
termination of agency, in view of cancellation of general 
power of attorney, the landlordship reverted to the 
original owner i.e Muhammad Nawaz and after his 
death/death certificate Ex-A.10, Zeshan/the present 
applicant became the inherited owner/landlord and he has 
rightly filed this ejectment petition and it is held that 
relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties 
has also established.” 
(Emphasis supplied)  
Here it is also imperative to mention that the learned Rent Tribunal 
while passing the impugned orders of eviction in connected matters 
observed that most of the witnesses, in the cases, are those who are 
tenants (petitioners before this Court) themselves in the building and 
are also witnesses of each other while the present petitioner, namely, 
Khurram Shahzad is one of them, who appeared as witness in more 
than one ejectment petitions. The petitioner in present petition while 
appearing in his own case admitted that he is not paying any rent to 
the respondent/landlord but to Suleman Shahid although the tenancy 
agreement (Exh.A-3), in his case, was executed by deceased Shahid 
Iqbal as attorney of predecessor-in-interest of the respondent/landlord. 
Occupancy of the rented premises under deceased Shahid Iqbal as 
attorney of the predecessor-in-interest of the respondent/landlord in 
connected cases has also not been denied. The documentary as well as 
oral evidence in present as well as connected cases clearly reflected 
that the father of the respondent/landlord, namely, Muhammad Nawaz 
is the owner of the rented premises, who executed power of attorney 
in favour of Shahid Iqbal that was later on revoked on the strength of 
which the petitioners were inducted as tenants of the deceased 
predecessor-in-interest of the respondent/landlord and hence, the 
petitioners cannot deny relationship of landlord and tenant with 

Writ Petition No.31543/2021 
 
15 
deceased Muhammad Nawaz that was created through the 
agent/attorney.   
13. 
Moreover, it is also worth mentioning that the suit for specific 
performance instituted by Suleman Shahid on the basis of agreement 
to sell executed in his favour by his father Shahid Iqbal qua attorney 
of Muhammad Nawaz regarding the rented premises in itself indicates 
that Muhammad Nawaz (father of the respondent/landlord) was the 
actual owner of rented premises and deceased Shahid Iqbal was only 
acting as attorney of the predecessor-in-interest of the respondent/ 
landlord and subsequent to the revocation of power of attorney, the 
status of the ownership of rented premises is admitted and also 
established relationship of landlord and tenant between the petitioners 
and the respondent/landlord, being the real owner of the rented 
premises.  
14. 
Suffice to observe that the petitioners, while admitting their 
occupation of the rented premises as tenant albeit under Suleman 
Shahid, went overboard by focusing on to disprove the title of the 
respondent/landlord and establishing the ownership of Suleman 
Shahid viz., the rented premises, without appreciating the fact that 
Suleman Shahid neither tried to become party in the ejectment petition 
nor the petitioners submitted the affidavit of the latter or got him 
summoned as a Court Witness in support of their stance. Interestingly, 
when the arguments were concluded in rebuttal before this Court and 
a pointed question was asked as to why Suleman Shahid never joined 
the proceedings before the learned Rent Tribunal as a party by filing 
an appropriate application and/or appeared as a witness, no plausible 
explanation was given, however, learned counsel for the petitioners 
stated that the petitioners before this Court have recently instituted a 
suit for rendition of accounts against the respondent/landlord and 
Suleman Shahid (the purported landlord of the petitioners), with the 
averments that due to active connivance of the respondent/landlord 
and Suleman Shahid, the petitioners have been non-suited in the 

Writ Petition No.31543/2021 
 
16 
eviction proceedings. This argument in itself is an admission on part 
of the petitioners that they are only tenants of the rented premises and 
were acting in support of their purported landlord namely, Suleman 
Shahid to prove his title in respect of the rented premises and have 
made all-out efforts to prolong the tenancy under him and the filing of 
suit for rendition of accounts against Suleman Shahid and the 
respondent/landlord is yet another attempt to continue with the same. 
Alleged 
connivance 
between 
Suleman 
Shahid 
and 
the 
respondent/landlord has no benefit to the latter, who is striving hard to 
seek eviction of the petitioners from the rented premises. On the other 
hand, admittedly the suit instituted by Suleman Shahid for specific 
performance of contract in respect of the rented premises has been 
dismissed and if a new round of litigation in the form of suit for 
rendition of accounts has been initiated by the petitioners, the same 
only facilitates the petitioners or Suleman Shahid to further prolong 
the litigation in respect of the rented premises.

In view of the above, the impugned orders of even date 
28.01.2021 and judgment dated 27.02.2021 passed by the learned 
Courts below in present as well as connected petitions do not suffer 
from any illegality, misreading/non-reading, jurisdictional defect or 
procedural impropriety, hence, the present as well as connected 
petitions are dismissed. No order as to costs.
