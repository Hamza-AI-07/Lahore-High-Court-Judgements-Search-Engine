ABID HUSSAIN CHATTHA, J. This Civil Revision is directed against 
the impugned Judgments & Decrees dated 21.03.2007 and 26.02.2009 
passed by Senior Civil Judge, Dera Ghazi Khan and Additional District 
Judge, Dera Ghazi Khan, respectively, whereby, the suit for declaration 
filed by Respondents No. 1 and 2 was concurrently decreed against Mian 
Manzoor 
Ahmad, 
predecessor-in-interest 
of 
the 
Petitioners                    
(the “Petitioner”).  
2. 
Succinctly, the facts divulged in the plaint are that the Deputy 
Commissioner, Dera Ghazi Khan demanded donation of free land for 
construction of Dispensary in Mauza Ghaus Abad, Dera Ghazi Khan. The 
Petitioner and Respondent No. 1 were real brothers and they collectively 
donated 07 Kanals & 05 Marlas land (the “suit property”) for the said 
purpose which was mutated by way of gift to the Provincial Government 
through the District Collector vide mutation No. 109 dated 31.03.1966. The 
Petitioner donated 03 Kanals & 16 Marlas of land, whereas, Respondent 
No. 1 donated 03 Kanals & 09 Marlas of land and Dispensary was 

2 
C. R. No. 174-D of 2009 
constructed by the Health Department of the Government of the Punjab on 
the suit property. Later, the Government approved Basic Health Unit       
(the “BHU”) in another Mouza for which separate land was required and 
request for donation was accordingly made. Respondent No. 1 was a 
political person and a member of the District Council. He proposed to the 
Petitioner that they may collectively donate 12 Kanals land for the BHU 
provided the suit property previously donated by them for the Dispensary is 
returned. However, the Petitioner did not agree to the proposal, whereafter, 
Respondent No. 1 separately and singly donated 12 Kanals land for 
construction of the BHU. In this behalf, the District Council, Dera Ghazi 
Khan passed the Resolution to the effect that the suit property previously 
donated for construction of Dispensary be returned to the person who 
donated the required land for the BHU. Accordingly, the suit property was 
transferred in the name of Respondent No. 1 vide mutation No. 564 dated 
02.01.1986. The abandoned building material of Dispensary was separately 
auctioned which was purchased by Respondent No. 1, whereafter, 
Respondent No. 1 is in possession of the suit property. It was further 
alleged in the plaint that the Petitioner did not object when the suit property 
was transferred back in the name of Respondent No. 1 and he also 
transferred 03 Kanals & 16 Marlas land to his son, Respondent No. 2. As 
such, Respondents No. 1 & 2 are owners in possession of the suit property 
and the Petitioner has no concern with the same. It was further stated that 
after a period of 12 years due to certain differences between the brothers, 
the Petitioner submitted an application on 12.01.1998 to the revenue 
officials for correction of mutation which was allowed and further 
challenge thereto in the revenue hierarchy by Respondents No. 1 and 2 
failed. As such, the orders dated 01.09.1998, 12.01.1999, 13.11.2000 and 
26.04.2001 passed by the revenue officials, whereby, mutation No. 564 
dated 02.01.1986 was rectified and the suit property was mutated in 
proportion to the respective shares of donation of the Petitioner and 
Respondent No. 1 are unlawful and against the law and facts for the reason 
that the suit property was returned to Respondent No. 1 alone in exchange 
for land gifted by him for the BHU. Hence, the order for correction of the 
said mutation was unlawful and the referred orders passed by the revenue 
officials are liable to be set aside. 

3 
C. R. No. 174-D of 2009 
3. 
The suit was contested by the Petitioner. It was submitted in the 
written statement that Respondent No. 1 unconditionally gifted the land 
measuring 12 Kanals for construction of the BHU. It was not given in 
exchange for the suit property which after extinguishment of the purpose 
for which it was donated had become surplus and was liable to be returned 
to the original donors in proportion to their previous ownership. No modern 
construction was raised on the suit property which existed in the abandoned 
condition. Respondent No. 1 succeeded to mutate it in his name to the 
exclusion of the Petitioner without his knowledge and consent. Upon 
gaining knowledge of mutation No. 564 dated 02.01.1986, the Petitioner 
moved an application to the revenue hierarchy for correction of mutation 
which was concurrently allowed.    
4. 
The Official Respondents No. 3 to 6 also filed written statement. It 
was admitted that the suit property was given to Respondent No. 1 in 
exchange of land measuring 12 Kanals. However, at the same time, it was 
also admitted that Deputy Commissioner had allowed correction of 
mutation in favour of the Petitioner. 
5. 
The Trial Court framed issues and recorded respective evidence of 
the parties. The pivotal issue was as to whether Respondents No. 1 and 2 
were owners in possession of the suit property to the exclusion of the 
Petitioner and if so, the impugned orders passed by the revenue officials 
were liable to be set aside. 
6. 
The Trial Court after appraisal of evidence on record held that 
Respondent No. 1 had proved his case and he was entitled for decree of 
declaration as prayed for. It was observed that although the suit property 
was gifted for Dispensary by the Petitioner and Respondent No. 1 in 
different shares yet later Respondent No. 1 gave 12 Kanals land in the year 
1986 for the BHU with the condition that the suit property would be 
returned to him. Therefore, the return of the suit property to Respondent 
No. 1 was lawful especially when the same was gifted to the Province of 
the Punjab and the Petitioner could not claim it back as a matter of right. In 
this context, letter dated 01.01.1986 (Ex. P-10) was issued regarding return 
of the suit property to Respondent No. 1 and in furtherance thereof, the 
mutation dated 02.01.1986 (Ex. P-12) was duly sanctioned. Respondent 
No. 1 had produced the copy of mutation (Ex. P-2) which depicted that he 

4 
C. R. No. 174-D of 2009 
had transferred 12 Kanals of land to the Health Department of the Province 
of the Punjab for the BHU. The Application of the Petitioner (Ex. P-8) 
dated 12.01.1998 for correction of mutation sanctioned on 02.01.1986 was 
filed after a lapse of 12 years and was barred by time in terms of Article 14 
read with Section 3 of the Limitation Act, 1908 as an order of the 
Government Officer can be challenged within a period of one year only. 
Accordingly, the suit was decreed.  
7. 
The Appellate Court maintained the Judgment of the Trial Court on 
the same premises. It further discussed letter dated 01.01.1986 issued by 
District Health Officer, Dera Ghazi Khan to conclude that the word 
‘owner’ depicted that the same was liable to be returned only to 
Respondent No. 1, otherwise, the word ‘owners’ should have been 
mentioned, if the suit property was intended to be returned in proportion to 
the original owners i.e. the Petitioner and Respondent No. 1. The 
Resolution of the District Council dated 08.07.1985 (Ex. P-3) was relevant, 
whereunder, the required land for construction of the BHU was donated by 
Respondent No. 1. Moreover, mutation No. 564 dated 02.01.1986 shows 
that the suit property was owned by the Provincial Government, as such, 
was in possession of District Council and was given to Respondent No. 1 in 
lieu of the land gifted by him for the BHU. Hence, the orders passed by the 
revenue hierarchy for correction of mutation in favour of the Petitioner 
were unlawful.  
8. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
9. 
The evidentiary resume of this case establishes that certain basic 
facts are admitted. The Petitioner and Respondent No. 1 jointly donated 03 
Kanals, 16 Marlas and 03 Kanals, 09 Marlas of land, respectively, 
constituting the suit property for construction of Dispensary. Later, 
Respondent No. 1 separately gifted another piece of land measuring 12 
Kanals for construction of the BHU in another Mouza. The Government 
abandoned the Dispensary and as such, the suit property became surplus 
property. The Health Department of the Government of the Punjab granted 
permission to return the suit property. Thus, the only question which 
requires determination is as to whether the entire suit property was lawfully 
transferred back to Respondent No. 1 considering that he had donated a 
separate piece of land measuring 12 Kanals for construction of the BHU or 

5 
C. R. No. 174-D of 2009 
the suit property should have been transferred to its donors in the same 
proportion in which it had been originally donated by them as concurrently 
held in the orders passed by the revenue hierarchy.  
10. 
It was specifically pleaded in the plaint that Respondent No. 1 had 
proposed to the Petitioner to donate the required land for construction of 
the BHU jointly and take back the suit property but the Petitioner declined 
the proposal. The Petitioner had specifically stated in his written statement 
that Respondent No. 1 had donated 12 Kanals of land voluntarily and 
unconditionally for construction of the BHU and the donation was never in 
exchange of the suit property. Even otherwise, the share of suit property of 
the Petitioner could not have been exchanged without his consent and no 
person has any right to deprive the Petitioner from his share in the suit 
property. The oral evidence on record is in line with the referred pleadings. 
This fact clearly established that the Petitioner had never consented to any 
proposal regarding reversion of the suit property to Respondent No. 1 to his 
exclusion. No such proposal was ever floated by the Government. There is 
also nothing on record that the suit property was exchanged with the gifted 
land of the BHU. Respondent No. 1 had never informed the District 
Council that the suit property was collectively gifted by the Petitioner and 
Respondent No. 1. As such, Respondent No. 1 as member of the District 
Council had maneuvered the resolution in his favor on wrong facts and 
without the knowledge and consent of the Petitioner. Even otherwise, the 
Resolution of the District Council was not binding, rather, was in the nature 
of a recommendation which can neither preempt the law nor could have 
divested the Petitioner from his legal entitlement regarding his share in the 
suit property. The mutation attested by Respondent No. 1 in favour of the 
Government clearly depicted that he had gifted 12 Kanals of land for the 
purpose of construction of the BHU and when the said property would 
become surplus, he being the only donor can legitimately claim it back. As 
such, the orders passed by the revenue hierarchy reverting the suit property 
in proportion to the donation of the Petitioner and Respondent No. 1 are in 
consonance with law. 
11. 
The interpretation extended by the Appellate Court to the word 
‘owner’ with reference to letter dated 01.01.1986 to the effect that it 
depicted that the suit property was allowed to be returned only to 

6 
C. R. No. 174-D of 2009 
Respondent No. 1 is completely misplaced. This was merely an internal 
letter conveying approval of return of the suit property based on 
proceedings initiated by Respondent No. 1 without the knowledge of the 
Petitioner. It was not determination of entitlement of the suit property in 
favor of Respondent No. 1. The said letter even wrongly mentions the 
measurement of the suit property as 06 Kanals. Therefore, the effect of the 
said letter was not more than permission to return the suit property having 
been abandoned after the extinguishment of the purpose of donation.   
12. 
It is also noted that observation of the Trial Court to the effect that 
challenge to mutation No. 564 dated 02.01.1986 was barred by time under 
Article 14 of First Schedule to the Limitation Act, 1908 is misplaced. This 
is on account of the reason that referred Article is applicable to suits 
instituted to set aside an act or order of an officer of the Government in his 
official capacity not otherwise expressly provided for which prescribes 
limitation of one year from the date of the act or order, whereas, the 
Petitioner had moved an application for correction of mutation under 
Section 166 of the Punjab Land Revenue Act, 1967 for which no limitation 
was prescribed. Jurisdiction conferred to revenue authorities under the said 
Section was wide enough to correct clerical or arithmetical errors. For 
reference, see case titled, “Dildar Ahmad and others v. Member                     
(Judicial-III) BOR, Punjab, Lahore and another” (2013 SCMR 906).  
13. 
Generally, a valid and complete gift is not retractable without the 
consent of both parties or by a decree since retraction of gift as a deed of 
conveyance is the very opposite of conveyance. Section 167 of 
Muhammadan Law by D. F. Mulla enunciates this principle. Gift is 
essentially without consideration. It is of two kinds, Hiba pertaining to 
corpus of property or Hiba pertaining to Areeat, which is a transfer of some 
limited interest for a limited time with the objective to allow the enjoyment 
or benefit of usufruct of gifted property. Any condition attached to a valid 
completed gift falling within the ambit of first kind is considered void, 
whereas, lawful conditions are recognized with respect to second kind of 
gift. Section 170 thereof defines Areeat as grant of a license, resumable at 
the grantor’s option, to take and enjoy the ‘usufruct’ of a thing. It follows 
that an Areeat is not a complete and absolute transfer of ownership but a 
temporary license in the nature of revocable and conditional transfer of 

7 
C. R. No. 174-D of 2009 
ownership allowing the benefit of ‘usufruct’ without any consideration. 
The grantor’s option can be validly capped or made conditional. As such, 
in common parlance, it may be termed as a conditional gift which operates 
and is revocable subject to conditions attached thereto. The determination 
as to whether a gift relates to ‘corpus’ or ‘usufruct’ of the property depends 
upon the facts and circumstances of each case to be inferred from relevant 
evidence after discovering the real intention of the donor and no hard and 
fast rule can be laid down for this purpose. For reference, see discussion on 
gifts in Chapter 11 of “D. F. Mulla’s Principles of Islamic Law 
(Muhammadan Law) with “Survey of Case-Law” from the Superior 
Courts”, Seventh Edition by M. Mahmood and Jawad Mahmood); and     
D. F. Mulla’s, Principles of Muhammad Law, Pakistan Edition by Dr.      
M. A. Mannan”. The Apex Court in case titled, “Muhammad Nawaz and 
others v. Muhammad Khan and others” (2005 SCMR 710) recognized and 
endorsed the two types of gift in terms of ‘corpus’ and ‘usufruct’ of the 
property. It was held that where a condition is attached to a gift of ‘corpus’ 
of the property, the gift is valid and the condition attached thereto is illegal. 
However, when gift is regarding ‘usufruct’ of the property, any condition 
attached thereto is valid and is liable to be given effect. In case titled, 
“Abdul Rehman and 68 others v. Province of Punjab through Collector, 
Bahawalpur and 23 others” (2009 YLR 753), it was held that a conditional 
gift never becomes absolute and always remains subject to the condition on 
the basis of which it is made. 
14. 
Articles 23 and 24 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”) grants protection to property rights as 
a fundamental right of the citizens. The principles enshrined therein 
stipulate that every citizen shall have the right to acquire, hold and dispose 
of property subject to the Constitution and any reasonable restrictions 
imposed by law in the public interest. Further, no person shall be 
compulsorily deprived of his property save in accordance with law. It is 
further articulated that no property shall be compulsorily acquired save for 
a public purpose and after payment of due and adequate compensation. It, 
therefore, follows that the public welfare schemes initiated by the State for 
the benefit of its citizens are required to be executed after acquisition of 
land subject to determination and payment of due and adequate 

8 
C. R. No. 174-D of 2009 
compensation in accordance with law. However, due to financial 
constraints, it is customary for the Government to execute various welfare 
schemes, such as, farm to market roads, schools, health and provision of 
other civic facilities on land volunteered by the residents. Such schemes 
generally require that free of cost land must be transferred in the name of 
concerned Government Department before a scheme is executed. The land 
is generally mutated in the villages in the name of the concerned 
Government Department through gift mutation as a convenient mode of 
transfer of land to satisfy the mandatory condition of the concerned 
Government Department. The intention of the party while executing such a 
transfer is unequivocally restricted to benefit from the project and the gift 
of land is intrinsically linked to the purpose of donation. Such gift of land 
is liable to be construed as a limited or conditional gift which is valid till 
the life of the project. Such land, in all fairness and equitable 
considerations, must revert to the owners once the purpose of donation 
extinguishes and the project is abandoned. The principle of reversion is 
also recognized in terms of Article 493 of Chapter XIV (Acquisition of 
Land for Public Purposes) of Punjab Land Administration & Management 
Manual administered by the Board of Revenue, Punjab even with respect to 
unutilized lands that may have been acquired. Therefore, gifts regarding 
‘usufruct’ of the property in the name of the State should be encouraged as 
this would give incentive and security to the donors to freely donate land to 
the Departments of the Government as the donors would know that the 
donated land would revert back to them including their legal heirs after the 
life of the project. Needless to reiterate that State is mandated by Article 3 
of the Constitution to eliminate all forms of exploitation. The instant case 
squarely falls within the parameters of conditional gift which was restricted 
to the use of ‘usufruct’ of donated suit property till the life of the project 
and was lawfully allowed to revert back to the donors. The orders 
sanctioning correction of mutation to ensure the proportionate reversion to 
the donors are unexceptional. Therefore, it is obvious that the Courts below 
have misread the evidence on record as well as misapplied the law to 
decree the suit of Respondents No. 1 and 2 which resuled into grave 
miscarriage of justice. Hence, notwithstanding the concurrent findings of 

9 
C. R. No. 174-D of 2009 
facts recorded by the Courts below, interference is warranted to redress the 
unlawful deprivation of the Petitioner. 
15. 
In view of the above, this Civil Revision is allowed and the 
concurrent impugned Judgments & Decrees dated 21.03.2007 and 
26.02.2009 passed by the Courts below are set aside. Consequently, the suit 
of Respondents No. 1 and 2 stands dismissed. No order as to costs.  
16. 
Office is directed to transmit a certified copy of this Judgment to the 
Senior Member, Board of Revenue, Punjab, Lahore who is directed to 
prescribe a clear mechanism of transfer of donated property for a limited 
purpose and time period under a preferred mode of transfer with the 
mechanism of its reversion to its owners after the life or purpose of the 
project to ensure due protection to the donors as well as to encourage such 
donations to meet the pressing communal and civic needs of the people 
amidst rising prices of immoveable property. Compliance report shall be 
filed in this behalf with the Deputy Registrar (Judicial) of this Court within 
a period of three months from the date of this Judgment regarding any 
decision or steps taken in this behalf.
