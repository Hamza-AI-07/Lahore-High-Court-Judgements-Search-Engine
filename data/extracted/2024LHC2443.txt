Anwaar Hussain, J.  The petitioner before this Court filed a suit for 
specific performance of contract against respondent No.3, M/s. Defence 
Raya Golf and Country Club Fairways Commercial (“the respondent”) on 
the basis of an agreement-cum-allotment dated 21.06.2016 (“the 
agreement”) in respect of commercial plaza, which was to be constructed 
by the respondent. The agreement was executed/issued pursuance to a 
balloting. Total sale consideration was agreed by the parties as 
Rs.156,000,000/-. An amount of Rs.500,000/- was paid to participate in the 
ballot and 5% of total amount as the booking price i.e., Rs.7,800,000/-, was 
to be paid within 14-days of the ballot result announced on DRGCC Website 
of the respondent. The petitioner made payments through Pay Order Nos. 
CHQ/995914/16006 and CHQ/995913/16005, Bank Islami Pakistan Limited

Johar Town Branch, Lahore dated 29.06.2016 amounting to Rs.3,200,000/- 
and Rs.4,600,000/-, respectively. It was one of the agreed terms between the 
parties that another 15% of remaining down payment was to be paid within 
next 14-days, failing which the allotment was to be cancelled.  
2. 
The petitioner in her suit averred that after lapse of 2 ½ months from 
the stipulated period of time, the petitioner was advised to deposit an amount 
of Rs.22,910,000/- out of total outstanding sale consideration, which was 
unwarranted and against the terms of the agreement and the petitioner, being 
a widow of Shaheed raising her minor daughter, is being  coerced to pay the 
amount beyond and in violation of the terms of the agreement, therefore, she 
was constrained to institute the suit for specific performance so that the 
respondent be directed to strictly adhere to the payment schedule envisaged 
under the agreement. When the suit was filed, vide order dated 28.07.2021, 
notices were issued by the learned Trial Court to the respondent and the 
petitioner was directed to submit Court fee of Rs.15,000/- and also the 
remaining consideration amount till the next date. On 04.11.2021, the 
petitioner was again directed to pay the remaining consideration as also the 
Court fee. Through order dated 24.03.2022, the plaint of the suit instituted 
by petitioner was rejected, under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908 (“CPC”) due to non-submission of the Court Fee as also 
the remaining consideration amount and reliance was placed upon the case 
reported as “Irfan Rasheed v. Muhammad Muazim and others” (PLD 2022 
Lahore 372). This order was not challenged. Thereafter, an application was 
filed by the petitioner for refund of Rs.22,910,000/- deposited in the 
Treasury, vide order dated 03.09.2021 through Challan Form No.32-A as 
partial payment out of total outstanding sale consideration. The said 
application was dismissed by the learned Trial Court on the ground that no 
such order whereby the petitioner was allowed to deposit the amount of 
balance consideration exists on the case file. The matter ended up before this 
Court in W.P. No.80627/2022 titled “Saima Batool v. Defense Raya Golf 
and Country Fairways Commercials, etc.”, and the matter was remanded to 
the learned Trial Court with the observation that if the said amount is found

to be deposited in compliance/furtherance of order of the Court and not 
required in any other matter, the learned Trial Court shall refund the said 
amount to the petitioner after due process. On remand, the learned Trial 
Court again rejected the application, vide order dated 29.04.2023 impugned 
in the present petition, inter alia, on the ground that since the petitioner did 
not lay challenge to order dated 24.03.2022, the same had attained finality, 
therefore nothing is left for the Trial Court to adjudicate. A revision petition 
was filed against order dated 29.04.2023, however, the same was also 
dismissed on the ground that the appeal is not maintainable for want of 
pecuniary jurisdiction, hence, the present constitutional petition.  
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner instituted 
a suit for specific performance of contract based on the agreement in which, 
by the order of the Court, an amount of Rs.22,910,000/-, was deposited after 
the Challan was issued by the learned Trial Court, attested copy whereof is 
available on record, which clearly depicts that the said amount was 
deposited in relation to the suit instituted by the petitioner against the 
respondent titled “Saima Batool v. Public at Large etc.”, however, later on, 
the suit was dismissed on account of non-deposit of the Court fee and non-
deposit of balance price consideration and when the petitioner’s application 
for return of said amount was filed, the same has been merely dismissed on 
the ground that the factum of deposit of said amount, pursuant to the order of 
the learned Trial Court, is not recorded in the order sheet, which fault cannot 
be attributed to the petitioner.  
4. 
Learned counsel for the respondent while acknowledging the factual 
matrix of the case, clarifies that the learned Trial directed to deposit 
complete balance sale consideration but the petitioner deposited lesser 
amount and therefore, the suit was dismissed. She further submits that since 
the suit instituted against the respondent has been dismissed, therefore, the 
respondent has no objection if the said amount is disbursed in favour of the 
petitioner, in accordance with law, as the respondent has no claim over the 
same. Fair stance taken by learned Counsel for the respondent is appreciated.

5. 
Learned Law Officer was directed to seek report from the Treasury 
Officer, Lahore. The needful was done and it was verified that the disputed 
amount had been deposited through Challan Form No.32-A, duly verified by 
the Court of Mubashar Hussain Awan, Civil Judge 1st Class, Lahore, under 
case titled “Saima Batool v. Public at Large, etc.” and the payment voucher 
can only be issued by the said Court, for release of the payment.  
6. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
7. 
At the outset, it would be essential to state that the Courts, as a 
repository of justice and in exercise of judicial power of the State, are 
obligated to dispense and administer justice and in the performance of this 
sacrosanct obligation, can neither cause nor become instrumental to 
perpetuate the injustice. Any act of Court perpetuating injustice would 
amount to undermining the sacrosanct existence of the Courts of law.  
8. 
Having observed so, this Court proceeds to determine whether the 
Trial Court was justified in declining the request of the petitioner and 
dismissing the application of the petitioner for return of the amount 
deposited in the Treasury, on the ground that the suit of the petitioner was 
dismissed for non-compliance of the order of the Trial Court to deposit the 
balance sale consideration and that the factum of deposit is not reflected in 
the order of the Trial Court even though deposit of the partial amount of sale 
consideration is duly depicted by the record such as the Challan Form. Even 
the Treasury Office, Lahore admitted in the report submitted before this 
Court that the said amount was deposited. Therefore, if the factum of 
allowing the application of the petitioner to deposit balance sale 
consideration has not been recorded in the order sheet of the Trial Court, 
said mistake cannot be attributed to the petitioner. It is settled principle of 
law that a litigant is not to be affected by mistake of the Court and if the 
petitioner’s application is not allowed, it will certainly be a case where the 
act and/or  omission of the court would result in grave injustice to the 
petitioner who is being made to suffer for no mistake of her as is evident 
from the fact that her suit was dismissed on 24.03.2022 and ever since then 

 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 57749/2023                                                                                                                    5 
 
 
her valuable money is being retained and not being returned to her and in the 
process, not only her money has depreciated over the period coupled with 
her deprivation form being able to invest the same and/or use the same as 
per her fundamental right. What added to her agony is that she was 
constrained twice to reach this Court by filing the present as well as earlier 
petition which in itself involves a financial as well as psychological ordeal 
that must have had accentuated effect considering the fact that she is widow 
of shaheed and raising her minor daughter as single parent.  
9. 
 There is no denial that the Trial Court directed the petitioner to 
deposit the balance sale consideration. An application was filed by the 
petitioner to deposit an amount of Rs. 22,910,000/- and it was “allowed” 
through an endorsement at the side margins of the said application, scanned 
copy whereof is pasted as under:

10. 
As noted above, learned Law Officer was directed to produce the 
original record from Treasury Office, Lahore, which is available that has 
been seen and returned. Attested copy of the Challan as also of the relevant 
register are annexed with the report. It is admitted feature of the case that the 
Challan was issued against which the payment was made and said payment 
is available in the Treasury and not needed for any other purpose. Attested 
copy of Challan Form indicates that a unique number i.e., 1518 was allotted 
in case of the petitioner and against which entry is duly recorded in the 
relevant register. Scanned copies of the Challan Form (with the unique 
number) and the extract from the relevant register are pasted hereunder:  
 
 

 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 57749/2023                                                                                                                    7 
 
 
The above referred two documents clearly indicated that the payment was 
deposited  by the petitioner in relation to the suit instituted by her against the 
respondent. There is also consensus between learned Law Officer along with 
learned counsel for respondent that neither the State nor the respondent has 
any right over this amount.  
11. 
The panacea to the present controversy lies in the doctrine of unjust 
enrichment1 coupled with the principle of restitution. The remedy for unjust 
enrichment is restitution: the restoration of what was conferred to the 
claimant-the petitioner in the present case. The doctrine of unjust enrichment 
aims at correction of the injustice that occurred when the claimant suffered a 
subtraction of wealth and some other individual, generally a defendant in a 
case, received a corresponding benefit. The doctrine of unjust enrichment 
has been well-developed in all systems of civil jurisprudence including 
France,2 Canada3, English4 and American5. In Pakistan and India, this 
doctrine is embodied in the Contract Act, 1872.6 The basis of the doctrine is 
that if a person has received any property or benefit from another, it is just 
that he should make restitution as otherwise he would be unjustly enriched at 
the expense of the other. 
12.  
Keeping these principles in mind, if the facts of this case are 
examined, it reveals that the petitioner did apply for permission to deposit 
the balance amount of consideration as per direction of the Trial Court albeit 
lesser amount and on side margins of the said application, it has been 
recorded that the application is “allowed” and duly signed by the then 
Presiding Officer of the Court. This Court is of the opinion that the  Courts 
                                                          
1 “Nul ne doit s'enrichir aux depens des autres”, which means “No one ought to enrich himself at the 
expense of others”.

Writ Petition No. 57749/2023                                                                                                                    8 
 
 
are not to act mechanically. It is surprising that the Trial Court has simply 
ignored that there is no adverse claimant of the amount. The Trial Court 
repeatedly fell in error in not appreciating its own record to become 
instrumental in perpetuating injustice. If the Trial Court after allowing the 
application of the petitioner to deposit the amount did not record the same in 
the order sheet, the same is inaction on part of the Court, which cannot be 
made basis of harm to the petitioner. This is trite and established law and 
forms the philosophical and jurisprudential basis of the established principle 
that no one can be prejudiced by the act of the Court based on maxim “actus 
curiae neminem gravabit” (the act of the Court harms no one).  
13. 
In view of the fact that the record of the Trial Court as also Treasury 
Office, Lahore clearly substantiate the contention of the petitioner that she 
deposited the amount of Rs.22,910,000/-in suit instituted by her for specific 
performance of contract, against the respondent and even if the suit has been 
dismissed, the respondent is not laying any claim on the same, therefore, it is 
unjust not to allow the refund on the basis of technicalities resulting into 
unjust enrichment of the State, which cannot be approved by this Court in 
exercise of its equitable jurisdiction.  
14.  
Sequel to the above discussion, the impugned order is set aside and 
the application of the petitioner to seek refund of the amount of 
Rs.22,910,000/- is accepted and the Trial Court is directed to procced in the 
matter enabling the petitioner to seek refund, after meeting codal formalities.    
15. 
Allowed in above terms.
