Imprisonment for life and to pay compensation of Rs.200,000/- to the legal 
heirs of deceased Zafar Iqbal as required u/s 544-A Cr.P.C. and in default

Benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C. was extended to the convict

2. 
Murder Reference No.361 of 2019 sent up by the trial Court for 
confirmation or otherwise of death sentence of appellant Muhammad Ihsan 
@ Malkoo and Criminal Revision No.2212/2020 preferred by complainant 
Hasnat Ahmad seeking enhancement of sentence of respondent No.2 namely 
Masood Ahmad @ Bilal will also be decided through this common 
judgment.  
3. 
The prosecution story unfolded in the crime report (Ex.PF/1) 
registered on the statement (Ex.PF) of complainant Hasnat Ahmad (PW-8) 
was that on 14.02.2018, he alongwith his brothers Zafar Iqbal (deceased), 
Muhammad Khan, (PW-9) and one Azhar Hayat (given up PW) were 
coming back to their homes after attending court proceedings in District 
Courts, Sargodha. At about 11.45 a.m. when they reached at Scacor Road 
near Chak No.60/East Daira Jora, appellants armed with 12-bores came in 
front of them. Appellant Ihsan raised Lalkara that they had come to take the 
revenge and opened a fire shot which hit at the right knee of Zafar Iqbal. He 
repeated the fire which landed at the right thigh of said Zafar Iqbal. His third 
fire was hit at the fuel tank of motor-cycle while the forth one was landed at 
the right shin of injured Muhammad Khan, who fell down from the motor-
cycle. Accused persons left the place on motor-cycle 125 without number 
while brandishing their guns. They attended the injured persons and took 
them to the Civil Hospital, Sargodha. Injured Zafar Iqbal succumbed to the 
injuries on the way to the hospital.  
 
Motive behind the occurrence was that appellant Ihsan @ Malkoo 
sustained injuries in an occurrence and the FIR in this regard was registered 
against the complainant and his deceased brother Zafar Iqbal alongwith one 
Mazhar Hayat, brother in law of deceased.  
4. 
Khalid Hayat, SI (PW-12) prepared injury statement as well as inquest 
report of deceased Zafar Iqbal and escorted his dead body to the mortuary.  
He visited the place of occurrence on the same day, took all necessary steps

of initial investigation and also recorded the statements of the witnesses 
under Section 161 Cr.P.C.  
 
 Muhammad Yar, SI (PW-11), produced the appellants before the 
Area Magistrate and obtained their physical remand. During investigation, 
appellant Ihsan @ Malkoo led to the recovery of motor-cycle No.SGL-1426 
Yamah 100 CC (P-1) and 12-bore repeater (P-2), which were taken into 
possession through recovery memos (Ex.PG & Ex.PH), respectively. 
Appellant Masood Ahmad, led to the recovery of 12-bore single barrel (P-3), 
which was taken into possession through recovery memo (Ex.PJ).  
5. 
Dr. Muhammad Sohail (PW-7) held autopsy on the dead body of 
deceased Zafar Iqbal Ditta on 14.02.2018 and observed three injuries on 
lower part of right thigh, front right knee joint with inverted margins and 
multiple firearm wound of exit, seven in number on inner side of right knee 
joint, lower part of right thigh, upper part of right left, underlying bone was 
fractured with averted margins.  According to his opinion injury No.1 & 2 
damaged 
major 
blood 
vessels 
leading 
of 
hemorrhagic 
shock, 
cardiopulmonary arrest and death. Probable duration between injuries and 
death was 25-30 minutes, whereas between death and post mortem 
examination, it was about four hours. 
 
On the same day, he also examined injured Muhammad Khan and 
observed one fire arm grazed wound 2.5 x 1 cm on inner, upper part of right 
leg skin deep. Injury was declared as Jurh Damiyah with no possibility of 
fabrication. 
7. 
At the commencement of trial, the trial Court framed a charge against 
the appellants to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.   
  
8. 
The prosecution examined 13-witnesses besides the reports of Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency Ex.PZ and Ex.PAA. The appellants, in their 
statements recorded under Section 342 Cr.P.C., had denied and controverted 
all the allegations of facts leveled against them.  They neither opted to make 
statements under Section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor produced any evidence in their 
defence.  
9. 
Learned trial Court, upon conclusion of the trial, convicted and 
sentenced the appellants, as stated above, vide impugned judgment dated

18.11.2019.  Hence, this criminal appeal, connected Murder Reference and 
as well as criminal revision.  
10. 
We have heard learned counsel for the appellants, learned Deputy 
Prosecutor General appearing for the State assisted by learned counsels for 
the complainant and perused the record with their able assistance.  
11. 
First of all, we would like to take up the case of appellant Masood 
Ahmad @ Bilal to whom admittedly neither any overt act nor any fire arm 
injury either to the deceased or injured was attributed and he was convicted 
and sentenced by the Trial Court for sharing ‘common intention’ with the 
principal accused. Ordinarily, every accused is individually responsible for a 
criminal act done by him. No one can be held responsible for an independent 
act or wrong committed by another. However, Section 34 PPC makes an 
exception to this principle, which for ease and ready reference is reproduced 
as under:- 
“34. Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention.—When a 
criminal act is done by several persons, in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such 
person is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone.” 
The main object for enactment of the aforesaid provision is to meet a case 
in which it is difficult to distinguish between act of each individual being 
members of a party who act in furtherance of common intention of all or 
to prove exactly what part was played by each of them. If A,B and C 
make a plan to kill D and in the execution of the crime, A buys a poison, 
B mixes it in food and C gives it to D, as a result of which D dies, it 
would be unjust to hold only C liable for murder. To deal with such cases, 
the above provision of vicarious liability was introduced. In case reported 
as “SHOUKAT ALI Versus THE STATE” (PLD 2007 Supreme Court 93), the Apex 
Court has observed that:-  
“Common intention' within the meaning of the section implies a pre-arranged plan, and to 
convict the accused of an offence applying the section it should be proved that the criminal act 
was done in concert pursuant to the pre-arranged plan. It is difficult if not impossible to 
procure direct evidence to prove the intention of an individual; in most case it has to be 
inferred from his act or conduct or other relevant circumstances of the case. Same or similar 
intention must not. be confused with common intention; the partition which divides "their 
bounds" is often very thin; nevertheless, the distinction is real and substantial, and if over 
looked, will result in miscarriage of justice. The inference of common intention should never 
be reached unless it is a necessary inference deducible from the circumstances of the case. 
Common intention does not mean similar intention of several persons. To constitute common 
intention, it is necessary that the intention of each one of them be known to the rest of them 
and shared by them. The common intention ought to be determined from such known facts and 
circumstances which existed before the commencement of the criminal act as the criminal act 
itself is committed in furtherance of that common intention.

          It was further laid down in the said judgment that;  
  
Mahmood, J., in Dharma Rai's case said "this section was the subject of consideration 
impliedly in the case of Queen v. Gorachand Gopee. At p.456, Sir Barnes Peacock clearly laid 
down the rule of law that mere presence of persons at the scene of an offence is not, ipso facto, 
sufficient to render them liable to any rule such as S.34 enunciates, and that `the furtherance of 
common design' was an essential condition before such a rule applied to the case of an 
individual person. It was probably in consequence of this expression of view from such a high 
authority that the Legislature by S.1 of Act XXVII of 1870, repealed the original S.34; and in 
substituting another section therefore, inserted the important word is 'in furtherance of the 
common intention of all,' as representing the condition precedent to each of such persons being 
held liable for the crime in the same manner as if it were committed by him alone. This change 
in the law is very significant, and it indicates to my mind that the original section having been 
found to be somewhat imperfectly worded, these additional words were introduced to draw a 
clear distinction that unpremeditated acts done by a particular individual, and which go beyond 
the object and intention of the original offence, should not implicate persons who take no part 
in that particular act. We have the opinion of an American jurist on the point, whom Mr. 
Mayne, in his Commentary on the Penal Code, quotes (Biship, S.439) where that learned 
author, lying down the rule, goes on to say:-- `But if the wrong done was a fresh and 
independent wrong, springing wholly from the mind of the doer, the other is not criminal 
therein, merely because when it was done he was intending to be a partaker with the doer in a 
different wrong.' This seems to me to be the right interpretation of the words `in furtherance of 
the common intention of all, as they occur in S.34 of the Penal Code" (in re Thipperudrappa 
(Vol. 55 1954 Cr.LJ 481). "The Supreme Court has held that it is well-established that a 
common intention pre-supposes prior concert. It requires a pre-arranged plan because before a 
man can be vicariously convicted for the criminal act of another, the act must have been done 
in furtherance of the common intention of them all. The inference of common intention should 
never be reached unless it is a necessary inference deducible from the circumstances of the 
case. All that is necessary is either' to have direct proof of prior concert, or proof of 
circumstances which necessarily lead to that inference or. the circumstances of the case. All 
that is necessary is either to have direct proof of prior concert, or proof of circumstances which 
necessarily lead to that inference or the incriminating facts must be incompatible with the 
innocence of the accused and incapable of explanation on any other reasonable hypotheses." 
(Poandurang v. State of Hyderabad (1955 Cr.LJ 572)”.  
  
After survey of almost entire law qua the enactment of provisions of 
Section 34 PPC, the Apex Court lastly laid down following pre-requisites 
for attracting the provisions of aforesaid Section:- 
 
"(a) It must be proved that criminal act was done by various persons  
  
(b) The completion of criminal act must be in furtherance of common intention as they all 
intended to do so.  
  
(c) There must be a pre-arranged plan and criminal act should have been done in concert 
pursuant whereof.  
  
(d) Existence of strong circumstances (for which no yardstick can be fixed and each case will 
have to be discussed on its own merits) to show common intention.  
  
(e) The real and substantial distinction in between `common intention' and `similar intention' 
be kept in view.”  
 
 
12. 
On the touchstone of above, guiding principles, now we have to see 
whether the case of the appellant falls within the ambit of vicarious liability 
or not. In the crime report, (Ex.PF) the complainant did not utter even a 

M.R. No.361/2019 
Crl. Appeal No.78896 of 2019 
Crl. Revision No.2212/2020

single word qua prior concert or pre-arranged plan to kill the deceased 
between the appellants. Even both the acclaimed eye-witnesses while 
appearing in the dock in the court room did not make even a slight indication 
that there was a plan or meeting of mind of both the appellants to commit the 
murder of deceased which was sina qua non for attracting the provisions of 
Section 34 PPC. Both the witnesses simply stated that at the time of crime, 
appellant while armed with fire arm was accompanying the principle 
accused. Mere presence of the appellant with the principal accused in the 
absence of any pre-arranged plan between them is not sufficient to hold him 
guilty of vicarious liability. In case Mahbub Shah .V. Emperor (A.I.R. 
(32) 1945 Privy Council 118), Allah Dad and few others were trying to 
collect reeds from the bank of the Indus River. They were warned by 
Mahboob Shah against collecting reed from land belonging to him. Ignoring 
the warning the deceased collected reeds but was stopped by Qasim Shah, 
nephew of Mahboob Shah while he was placing them on the boat. Qasim 
Shah was hit by the victim by a bamboo pole. On hearing Qasim Shah’s 
cries for help, Mahboob Shah and his son Wali Shah came while armed with 
their guns. Wali Shah fired at the victim who died instantly and Mahboob 
Shah fired another person causing him some injuries. This Court ( Lahore 
High Court ) sentenced Mahboob Shah with the murder of the victim under 
Section 302 Penal Code read with Section 34 but on appeal Privy Council 
set-aside the conviction of Mahboob Shah while observing that common 
intention required pre-arranged plan and it has to be proved that the criminal 
act was done in concert pursuant to the pre-arranged plan. Here the two 
accused might be having the same or similar intention but not the common 
intention and since the firing of Mahboob Shah did not kill anyone, he was 
not held liable for murder by application of Section 34. Here in the instant 
case, entire prosecution evidence is silent qua the relationship of the 
appellant with the principal accused. Neither the motive part of occurrence 
has any relevance with the appellant nor there is any iota of material from 
which it could be inferred that the appellant has any animosity with the 
complainant party. Learned Trial Court while holding the appellant guilty of 
vicarious liability has observed that “Admittedly, Ihsan alias Malku accused 
was amputated with his one leg much before the instant occurrence. He was 

M.R. No.361/2019 
Crl. Appeal No.78896 of 2019 
Crl. Revision No.2212/2020

in absolute need of a companion to accompany him to court and back depart 
to his village. Allegedly the accused was taken by Masood accused on a 
motorcycle while approaching to crime venue. The alleged role played for 
Masood accused was found essential and contributory in execution of design 
of occurrence and the circumstances of his presence alongwith principle 
offender admittedly amputated with one leg itself establish the fact of his 
provided assistance and sharing of common intention. It is concluded that 
the accused was not merely present at crime scene on relevant time but he 
played pivotal role in instant occurrence.”  The above observations of the 
learned Trial Court are entirely based on surmises and conjectures. The 
prosecution has not placed on record any material from which it could be 
inferred that the principal accused without the help of someone else was 
unable to ride the motor-cycle. No doubt the leg of the principal accused was 
amputated but the complainant (PW-8) during cross-examination denied the 
suggestion that due to amputation of leg principal accused was unable to 
walk and work rather voluntarily stated that the principal accused get an 
artificial leg and was capable to deal in routine work. Moreso, in the crime 
report, it was the case of the prosecution that the accused persons came on 
the crime scene at Honda 125 without number but the motor-cycle which 
was shown to be recovered at the instance of the principal accused bears 
registration No.SGL-1426 Yamah 100 CC, as such assumption of the Trial 
Court that the appellant brought the principal accused on the crime scene at 
motor-cycle is not made out from the record. Even otherwise, if for the sake 
of arguments it is assumed that the principal accused was unable to do any 
routine work due to amputation of his leg and the appellant bring him back 
from the Court, even then in the absence of any evidence that intention of 
principal accused to kill the deceased was in the knowledge of the appellant, 
he cannot be held guilty of vicarious liability. In view of what has been 
discussed above, we are of the considered view that the prosecution has 
miserably failed to prove the charge against the appellant for sharing 
common intention with the principal accused, as such his conviction and 
sentence on that basis cannot be allowed to hold the field.  
13. 
Now coming to the case of principal accused/appellant Ihsan @ 
Malkoo. Hasnat Ahmad, (PW-8)/complainant and Muhammad Khan, (PW-

9) /injured while appearing in the dock in the court room unanimously raised 
accusing fingers towards him for causing two fire shots at the right thigh and 
right knee joint of deceased Zafar Iqbal and one at the upper part of right leg 
of injured (PW-9), while they were on their way to home after attending 
court proceedings. In the course of cross-examination, both the witnesses of 
ocular account remained firm and consistent on all material aspects of the 
incident qua the date, time, place, mode and manner of the occurrence, name 
of the appellant, weapon of offence, role played by him for committing 
murder of the deceased and causing injuries to the injured witness and the 
defence could not extract any favourable material from their mouths.   
 
Learned defence counsel laid much emphasis that the complainant 
was neither witness in the criminal case, which was fixed on the fateful day 
nor he sustained even a scratch on his body and as such his presence at the 
venue of occurrence was highly doubtful.  We are not in agreement with the 
submission of learned defence counsel. During evidence, it came on surface 
that the complainant was also accused in a motive case of occurrence. No 
doubt the case, which was fixed on the fateful day was not the motive case 
but another case got lodged by the deceased against the appellant, however, 
keeping in view the previous criminal litigation, it is not unusual in our 
society for a person to accompany his brother in the court proceedings as a 
matter of pre-caution. Even otherwise, on this point the defence has 
questioned the complainant at a considerable length but he remained firm 
and consistent and even gave minute details of the incident in a quite natural 
manner, which established his presence at the venue of occurrence at the 
relevant time without any doubt.  
14. 
Muhammad Khan (PW-9), sustained injuries during the occurrence, as 
such his presence at the venue of occurrence at the relevant time cannot be 
questioned, however, learned defence counsel raised the objection that the 
statement of said witness U/S 161 Cr.P.C. was not recorded, therefore, his 
testimony before the Court cannot be made basis to sustain conviction and 
sentence of the appellant. We are unable to agree with the submission of the 
learned counsel as a proper procedure for recording of prosecution evidence, 
after framing of charge has been laid down in Section 265-F of Cr.P.C. 
Nowhere in the said section a prohibition has been contained that the Court 

M.R. No.361/2019 
Crl. Appeal No.78896 of 2019 
Crl. Revision No.2212/2020

is bound only to record the testimony of a person, whose statement U/S 161 
Cr.P.C. was recorded by the police. Sub-Section (2) of said section reads as 
under:- 
 
“(2) The Court shall ascertain from the public prosecutor or, as the case may be, from the 
complainant, the names of any persons likely to be acquainted with the facts of the case and to be 
able to give evidence for the prosecution, and shall summon such persons to give evidence before 
it.” 
Here in the instant case, said witness sustained injury during the occurrence 
and even his name was reflecting in the calendar of witnesses. The Medical 
Officer (PW-3), who conducted his medico legal examination ruled out any 
possibility of fabrication qua the injury sustained by him, therefore, none 
else is more aware of the facts than the said witness and his testimony 
cannot be excluded merely for the reasons that the Investigating Officer due 
to negligence or with malafide intention did not record his statement U/S 
161 Cr.P.C. Reliance is places on case reported as “Sajid Mehmood ..Vs.. 
The State” (2022 SCMR 1882), wherein it has been laid down as under:- 
 
“ The very purpose of Section 265-F is to ensure the concept of a fair trial and to achieve 
this purpose equal opportunity has been given to both the accused and the prosecution for 
summoning the evidence. There is nowhere mentioned in this Section that only those witnesses 
could be examined whose statements under section 161, Cr.P.C. have been recorded. Under this 
provision of law i.e. section 265-F the Trial Court is not bound to record the statements of only 
those witnesses who have been listed in the calendar of witnesses. On the other hand, section 540, 
Cr.P.C. empowers the Trial Court to summon a material witness even if his name did not appear in 
the column of witnesses provided his evidence is deemed essential for the just and proper decision 
of the case. In the present case, although the statement of Zameer Hussain (PW-11) under section 
161, Cr.P.C. could not be recorded by the Police yet the fact remains that he was named as an eye-
witness in the very FIR and was fully acquainted with the facts and the circumstances of the 
case.”  
15. 
Though both the witnesses of ocular account were closely related to 
the deceased inasmuch as the real brothers of deceased yet their testimony 
cannot be discarded merely on this score by treating them interested 
witnesses. One of the witnesses sustained injury during the occurrence and 
as has been discussed supra the complainant has also established that he was 
accompanying the deceased at the relevant time, as such they were quite 
natural witnesses, who can conveniently describe the incident in the manner 
as it happened as compared to any other independent witness.  There was no 
earthly reason for the eye witnesses to falsely implicate the appellant in 
substitution of the real culprit.  Even otherwise, substitution of the real 

M.R. No.361/2019 
Crl. Appeal No.78896 of 2019 
Crl. Revision No.2212/2020 
 
10 
 
 
culprit with an innocent one, in particular, where the eye-witnesses have lost 
their close kith and kin, is a rare phenomenon.  It is well established 
principle in criminal administration of justice that mere relationship of the 
eye-witnesses with the deceased is not sufficient to discard their evidence, if 
the same was otherwise found confidence inspiring and trustworthy.  
Reliance is placed on case reported as “Ghulam Murtaza Versus. The State” 
(2021 SCMR 149). 
16. 
Next objection of the defence was that one of the witnesses namely 
Azhar Hayat mentioned in the crime report was given up by the prosecution, 
so the inference could be drawn that he was not ready to support the 
prosecution version. This submission is repelled. It is well settled by now 
that the prosecution is not bound to produce all the witnesses. If the 
appellant was sure that this witness was not ready to support the prosecution 
witnesses, he had ample opportunity rather at liberty to examine him in his 
defence or even submit application before the trial Court to summon him as 
Court Witness but merely on that basis other overwhelming and confidence 
inspiring prosecution evidence cannot be discarded. Reliance is placed on 
case reported as “Saeed Akhtar and others ..Vs.. The State” (2000 SCMR 
383).  
17. 
Dr. Muhammad Sohail (PW-7) held autopsy on the dead body of 
deceased Zafar Iqbal on 14.02.2018 and observed three injuries on lower 
part of right thigh, front right knee joint with inverted margins and multiple 
firearm wound of exit, seven in number on inner side of right knee joint, 
lower part of right thigh, upper part of right left, underlying bone was 
fractured with averted margins.  According to his opinion injury No.1 & 2 
damaged 
major 
blood 
vessels 
leading 
of 
hemorrhagic 
shock, 
cardiopulmonary arrest and death. Probable duration between injuries and 
death was 25-30 minutes, whereas between death and post mortem 
examination, it was about four hours.  
 
The locale, number and nature of injuries, kind of weapon used for 
causing these injuries and the duration between injuries and death as well as 
death and post mortem examination, was exactly in consonance with the 
ocular account and as such, the medical evidence lends full support to the 
ocular version furnished by the prosecution.

The above said Medical Officer also examined injured Muhammad 
Khan and observed one fire arm grazed wound 2.5 x 1 cm on inner, upper 
part of right leg skin deep, which was also in consonance with the ocular 
account of the injured. The Medical Officer has ruled out the possibility of 
fabrication of said injury and the defence also did not make any effort to get 
constitute a District Standing Medical Board for re-examination of the 
injured, in the absence whereof, we are unanimous in holding that the 
medical evidence finds full support for the prosecution story.  
18. 
Motive as set-out by the prosecution was that earlier the appellant 
sustained fire arm injury due to which his leg was amputated and the FIR of 
the said incident was lodged against the complainant, deceased Zafar Iqbal 
and his brother in law namely Mazhar Hayat. Amputation of the leg of the 
appellant at the hands of the complainant party was not denied rather 
admitted by the appellant. During evidence, it came on surface that the 
deceased and the complainant have been acquitted in the said case, which 
added fuel to the fire. Moreso, the deceased also got lodged an FIR 
No.139/14 dated 15.04.2024, in respect of offence U/S 382 & 435 PPC, P.S. 
Jhal Chakian, District Sargodha against the appellant and injured 
Muhammad Khan (PW-9) was the eye-witness of the said occurrence, which 
was fixed on the fateful day, therefore, there can be no other reason for the 
appellant to take the life of deceased. No doubt previous enmity, being 
motive, is always considered as a double edged weapon but from the 
evidence available on record it has been established that it was the sole 
reason of this unfortunate incident.  With this backdrop, we are persuaded to 
hold that the prosecution has successfully proved motive part of the 
occurrence.  
19. 
During investigation, appellant led the police party to the recovery of 
12-bore repeater (P-2), which was sent to the office of Punjab Forensic 
Agency, Lahore for comparison with the crime empties secured from the 
spot and the report of said office (Ex.PAA) has been received with negative 
result rendering the recovery of weapon of offence from the appellant 
inconsequential.

From this discussion, we have entertained no manner of doubt in our 
mind that the prosecution has been able to prove the charge of homicidal

death of the deceased at the hands of the appellant Muhammad Ihsan @ 
Malkoo through cogent, reliable and confidence inspiring evidence. The 
appellant was named in the crime report with the specific role of causing two 
successive fire arm injuries to the deceased resulting into his death.  Both the 
witnesses of ocular account furnished plausible explanation of their presence 
at the place of occurrence at the relevant time.  The ocular account is firm 
and consistent inter-se supported with the medical evidence. This 
overwhelming evidence constrained us to concur with the conclusion arrived 
at by the trial Court qua the conviction of the appellant under Section 302(b) 
PPC. 
21. 
Now coming to the quantum of sentence. It is well settled by now that 
question of quantum of sentence, requires utmost caution and thoughtfulness 
on the part of the Court. In this regard, reliance is placed on case reported as 
Mir Muhammad alias Miro ..Vs.. The State (2009 SCMR 1188) wherein 
it has been laid as under:- 
“It will not be out of place to emphasize that in criminal cases, the question of quantum of 
sentence requires utmost care and caution on the part of the Courts, as such decisions 
restrict the life and liberties of the people. Indeed the accused persons are also entitled to 
extenuating benefit of doubt to the extent of quantum of sentence.” 
Here in the instant case, we have taken note of some mitigating factors. 
Firstly, recovery of weapon of offence from the appellant remained 
inconsequential. Secondly, co-accused Masood Ahmad @ Bilal has been 
acquitted of the charge.  It is well settled that no special circumstance is 
required to consider mitigation for converting the sentence of death into 
imprisonment for life rather an iota of single instance is sufficient to justify 
lesser sentence. Reliance is placed on case reported as “Dilawar Hussain 
..Vs.. The State (2013 SCMR 1582)” wherein it has been laid down as 
under:- 
“It has neither been mandate of law nor the dictates of this Court as to what quantum of 
mitigation is required for awarding imprisonment for life rather even an iota towards the 
mitigation is sufficient to justify the lesser sentence.” 
It is also settled principle of law that when a case qualifies the awarding of 
both sentences of imprisonment for life and that of the death, the proper 
course for the Courts, as a matter of caution, is to give preference to the 
lesser sentence.  Reference may be made to case titled “GHULAM MOHY-

UD-DIN alias HAJI BABU and others versus The STATE” (2014 SCMR 
1034) wherein it has been observed at page 1044 as:- 
“In any case, if a single doubt or ground is available, creating reasonable doubt in 
the mind of Court/Judge to award death penalty or life imprisonment, it would be 
sufficient circumstances to adopt alternative course by awarding life imprisonment 
instead of death sentence.” 
 
22. 
In view of what has been discussed above, the appeal in hand is 
partially allowed, the conviction and sentence of appellant Masood Ahmad 
@ Bilal are hereby set-aside and he is acquitted of the charge by extending 
him the benefit of doubt. He is on bail, his bail bonds as well as surety 
stands discharged from the liability. However, appeal to the extent of 
appellant Muhammad Ihsan @ Malkoo stands dismissed by maintaining his 
conviction in offence under Section 302(b) PPC, however his sentence of 
capital punishment is converted into one of imprisonment for life. The 
amount of compensation and sentence in lieu thereof and his conviction U/S 
337-F(i) PPC shall remain intact.  The appellant is given benefit of Section 
382-B Cr.P.C. 
23. 
Murder Reference No.361 of 2019 is answered in the NEGATIVE 
and the Death Sentence awarded to appellant Muhammad Ihsan @ Malkoo 
is not confirmed.

For the reasons enumerated above, since respondent No.2 has been 
acquitted of the charge, therefore, instant petition seeking enhancement of 
his sentence has lost its relevance and stands dismissed accordingly.
