JAWAD HASSAN, J. By 
invoking 
the 
constitutional 
jurisdiction of this Court under Article 199 of the Constitution of 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”), the Petitioner 
has challenged quasi-judicial order dated 04.08.2014 passed by 
Respondent No.4 pursuant to directions issued by this Court in 
W.P.No.2556 of 2013 vide order dated 08.05.2014.  
2. 
Facts of the case are that the Petitioner joined POF Board Wah 
Cantt. on 07.11.1985 and rendered his services there till 07.09.1999. 
Subsequently he was relieved therefrom consequent upon his selection 
to the post of Director (BS-19) in Ministry of Population Welfare. 
However, while relieving on 07.09.1999, his lien was retained in POF 
till completion of probation period for one year extendable by one 
further one year. The Petitioner brought W.P.No.2556 of 2013 seeking 
allotment of residential plot in the Officers Colony, POF Society, Wah 
Cantt. which was disposed of vide order dated 08.05.2014 with a 
direction to concerned Respondent to decide it; pursuant to which the 
impugned order was passed, hence this petition.

3. 
Learned counsel for the Petitioner, while reiterating the contents 
of the petition inter alia submitted that the Petitioner rendered 13 years 
and 10 months services with POF Board and if the service rendered in 
Ministry of Religious Affairs and period of lien retained in POF is 
considered, the criteria regarding minimum length of service i.e. 15 
years becomes fulfilled; that the POF has accepted his request qua 
counting of continuous service therefore the Petitioner is entitled for the 
relief which has been rejected through the impugned order.  
4. 
On the other hand, learned law officer submitted that as per 
report and parawise comments submitted by the Respondents, the 
Petitioner is not entitled for the relief claimed for as he was relieved 
from POF upon his selection as Director in the Ministry of Population 
Welfare and his lien was retained till completion of probation period of 
one year and that too was expired.   
5. 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through the 
available record. 
6. 
The rendering of service by the Petitioner to the POF w.e.f. 
07.11.1985 to 07.09.1999 is not disputed by the parties. However, 
matter in issue is with regard to allotment of residential plot which has 
been denied by the Respondents through the impugned order. It evinces 
from the impugned order that the Petitioner served POF for 13 years 
and 10 months whereas the minimum length of service required for 
allotment of plot as per POF Rules for Allotment of Residential Plots to 
Officers, 2002 (the “Rules”) is 15 years. Rule 5 of the “Rules” 
prescribes eligibility conditions for allotting of plots which reads as 
under: 
“5.  Eligibility conditions for allotment of plots: (1) The 
minimum length of service for allotment of plots shall be 
15 years which will include the service qualifying for 
pension rendered in POF and other Government 
department and also the contractual service rendered in 
POF. 
(2) 
Following persons shall be entitled to allotment: 
i. 
All officers of POF holding posts in BS-16 
and above; 
ii. 
Commissioned Army Officers posted to POF 
on secondment against POF posts or against 

Writ Petition No.585 of 2015                
 
 
 
 
 
   3 
the Post of Army sanctioned for POF having 
stay at their present appointment in POF at 
least for a period of 02 years. 
iii. 
Officers of allied departments namely COFA, 
DSG, IDA, FAOF, SSD and FIU, holding 
posts in BS-16 and above or equivalent 
having stay at their present appointment in 
POF at least for a period of 02 years.  
iv. 
A POF employee holding posts in BS-16 and 
above, who retired after last allotment of 
1994 and widow of POF employee who died 
after last allotment of 1994. 
v. 
A POF employee (holding posts in BS-16 and 
above), invalidated i.e. Boarded out on 
Medical ground. 
vi. 
In case of death of an employee as result of 
accident during course of employment, next 
of kin (widow or legitimate heir) shall be 
entitled to allotment of plot (as per 
entitlement of deceased employee at the time 
of death) on priority irrespective of length of 
service or other eligibility conditions subject 
to availability of land”. 
 
7. 
Above said Rule prescribes eligibility conditions for allotment of 
plot; Rule 5(1) of the “Rules” clearly depicts that 15 years length of 
service is required to become entitled for allotment of residential plot 
while Rule 5(2) of the “Rules” mentions the category of persons 
entitled to allotment.  In the case in hand, the Petitioner was admittedly 
relieved from the service of POF on 07.09.1999 to join the post of 
Director (BS-19) in the Ministry of Population Welfare; though his lien 
was retained to get back in POF till completion of his probation period 
yet the Petitioner joined the new post as Director (BS-19) in the 
Ministry of Population Welfare where his services were regularized and 
even he was promoted to BS-20 and he never get back to his parent 
department within probation period. In the context of service law, the 
term "lien" has a statutory connotation and refers to a legal right of a 
civil servant to hold a particular post, typically a higher one, to which 
they have been promoted or transferred, while still retaining a right on 
their original post, based on provisions provided for the same under the 
rules or regulations framed by the appropriate Government. Hence, 

Writ Petition No.585 of 2015                
 
 
 
 
 
   4 
simply put, lien in service law is a right of a civil servant to return to his 
original position, based on the fulfilment of the conditions set out in the 
rules or regulations framed by the appropriate Government. Pertinently, 
the “Rules” were promulgated on 31.05.2002 and Rule 1(3) of the 
“Rules” clearly speaks that the “Rules” shall come into force at once. 
The “Rules” thus does not, either expressly or impliedly, provide for 
any retrospective application of the clauses of the “Rules”, the same 
cannot therefore operate to reverse or undo an action which took effect 
from 07.09.1999, prior to the date the said Rules came into existence. 
Furthermore, the Petitioner was not the employee of the POF at the time 
of promulgation of the “Rules” therefore, he is not entitled for the 
allotment of plot in terms of Rule 5 of the “Rules”.  
8. 
The order dated 04.08.2014 is indicative of the fact that the 
“Respondent No.4” complied with directions of this Court dated 
08.05.2014 and decided the matter while providing opportunity of 
hearing to the Petitioner on 27.07.2014. Pertinently, the petition in hand 
was filed on 04.03.2015 questioning the above-stated impugned order 
after lapse of almost six months without explaining any convincing 
reasons for the inordinate delay, as such principle of laches is also 
applicable upon this case as three months’ time is considered reasonable 
for a party to assail an adverse order in writ jurisdiction of this Court. 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan in “CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY 
through Director General and 3 others Versus Mir ZULFIQAR ALI and 
another” (2016 SCMR 183) has held as under: 
 “The respondent No.1, who appeared in person, 
despite opportunity failed to explain or justify the 
delay. Since the petition was filed after a lapse of 
almost 10 years and that too without any 
justification or explanation for such delay, the 
same ought to have been dismissed as such” 
 
  
In “STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN through Governor and 
another Versus IMTIAZ ALI KHAN and others” (2012 SCMR 280) it 
has held as under:  
“laches is a doctrine whereunder a party which 
may have a right, which was otherwise 
enforceable, loses such right to the extent of its 

Writ Petition No.585 of 2015                
 
 
 
 
 
   5 
enforcement if it is found by the Court of a law 
that its case is hit by the doctrine of 
laches/limitation. Right remains with the party but 
it cannot enforce it. The limitation is examined by 
the Limitation Act or by special laws which have 
inbuilt provisions for seeking relief against any 
grievance within the time specified under the law 
and if party aggrieved do not approach the 
appropriate 
forum 
within 
the 
stipulated 
period/time, the grievance though remains but it 
cannot be redressed because if on one hand there 
was a right with a party which he could have 
enforced against the other but because of 
principle of limitation/laches, same right then 
vests/accrues in favour of the opposite party”. 
 
  
It was further held by Supreme Court of Pakistan in “MEMBER 
(S&R)/CHIEF 
SETTLEMENT 
COMMISSIONER, 
BOARD 
OF 
REVENUE, PUNJAB, LAHORE and another Versus Syed ASHFAQUE 
ALI and others” (PLD 2003 Supreme Court 132) as under: 
“On account of Laches in setting the machinery of 
law into motion they have indeed disentitled 
themselves to the exercise of discretionary and 
equitable jurisdiction, which in all cases must be 
exercised in order to foster the ends of justice and 
to right a wrong. Writ jurisdiction is undoubtedly 
discretionary and extraordinary in nature which 
may not be invoked by a party who demonstrates a 
style of slackness and laxity on his part. 
Furthermore, if a party does not choose legal 
remedy available under the Statute strictly 
speaking Constitutional jurisdiction of the High 
Court cannot be exercised in his favour. Law is 
well-settled that a patty guilty of gross negligence 
and laches is not entitled to the equitable relief. 
One who seeks equity must show that equities lean 
in his favour. In the facts and circumstances of the 
appeal we are, therefore, in no manner of doubt 
that the High Court was not competent to exercise 
its writ jurisdiction conferred under Article 199 of 
the Constitution”. 
 
9. 
It is noted that the Petitioner first time brought his claims 
regarding financial benefits of his previous service with POF and also 
claimed a residential plot on the basis thereof in year 2014 however, his 
previous service rendered with the POF were allowed to be counted 

Writ Petition No.585 of 2015                
 
 
 
 
 
   6 
merely for pension purposes vide letter dated 29.10.2014 but this does 
not a solid ground for entitlement of plot under Rule 5 of the “Rules” as 
he was not the employee of the POF at the time of promulgation of the 
“Rules” as discussed above. Moreover, it is settled law that, writ is only 
for enforcement of fundamental rights and not for entitlement of rights as 
per law laid down by Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
“ASDULLAH MANGI and others Versus PAKISTAN INTERNATIONAL 
AIRLINES CORPORATION and others” (2005 SCMR 445) wherein it 
has been held that “the right which is the foundation of an application 
under Article 199 of the Constitution is a personal and individual right. 
The legal right may be a statutory right or a right recognized by the law. 
A person can be said to be aggrieved only when a person is denied a 
legal right by someone who has a legal duty to perform relating to the 
right. There must not only be a right but a justifiable right in existence, to 
give jurisdiction to the High Court in the matter. Unless whatever right, 
no order can be issued under Art. 199.” It has been further held in the 
judgment supra that Object of proceedings initiated under Article 199 of 
the Constitution is the enforcement of a right and not the establishment of 
legal right and therefore, the right of the incumbent concerned which he 
seeks to enforce, must not only be clear and complete but simplicitor and 
there must be an actual infringement of the right”. 
10. 
In view of above, learned counsel for the Petitioner is unable to 
point out any illegality or irregularity in the impugned order warranting 
interference by this Court in its Constitutional jurisdiction. Resultantly, 
the instant petition stands dismissed.
