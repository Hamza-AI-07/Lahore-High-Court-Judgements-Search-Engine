Mian Bilal Safdar, Advocate, with the Petitioner. 
Rai Asif Mahmood, Deputy Prosecutor General, with 
Ali/ASI. 
The Complainant in person. 
 
 
 
Through this application, the Petitioner seeks pre-arrest bail 
in case FIR No.6803/2022 dated 2.12.2022 registered at Police Station 
Chung, Lahore, for offences under sections 337-U, 337-L(2) of the 
Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 (“PPC”). 
2. 
 
Briefly, the prosecution case is that on 29.11.2022 at about 
05:15 p.m. the Petitioner and his co-accused, while armed with different 
weapons, attacked the Complainant and his cousin Adeel and wounded 
them. 
3. 
 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
4. 
 
The Petitioner is nominated in the FIR with the specific 
allegation that he hit Complainant’s cousin Adeel in the face with an 
iron rod, breaking two teeth. The Medical Officer has classified this 
injury as Itlaf-i-salahiyyat-i-udw. Mian Bilal Safdar, Advocate, contends 
that it attracts section 337-U PPC and is punishable with Arsh only. 
Since the law does not provide any jail term for the offence, the 
Petitioner is entitled to bail. 
5. 
 
Chapter XVI of the Pakistan Penal Code deals with 
offences affecting the human body. Section 332(1) PPC defines hurt. It 
states that a person is said to cause hurt when he causes pain, harm, 
disease, infirmity, or injury to another person or impairs, disables, 
disfigures, defaces, or dismembers any organ of his body or part without

causing his death. According to section 332(2) PPC, hurt is of the 
following kinds: 
(a) 
Itlaf-i-udw 
(b) 
Itlaf-i-salahiyyat-i-udw 
(c) 
Shajjah 
(d) 
Jurh 
(e) 
All kinds of other hurts. 
6. 
 
According to section 333 PPC, a person is said to cause 
Itlaf-i-udw if he dismembers, amputates, or severs somebody’s limb or 
body organ. This offence is punishable under section 334 PPC. 
7. 
 
Section 335 PPC defines Itlaf-i-salahiyyat-i-udw as the 
destruction or permanent impairment of the functioning, power, or 
capacity of a person’s body organ. This offence is punishable under 
section 336 PPC. 
8. 
 
The first question that requires determination is whether the 
tooth is an organ. 
9. 
 
Teeth and bones comprise minerals and tissues, including 
calcium, phosphorus, and collagen, which give them strength and 
durability. Calcium and phosphorus are the most abundant minerals in 
both teeth and bones, while collagen is a protein that offers flexibility 
and resilience. Other minerals, including sodium, potassium, and 
magnesium, are also present in bones and teeth, but in much lesser 
amounts. Another similarity between teeth and bones is their structure. 
Both have a thick outer layer surrounding a softer, more flexible inner. 
This outer layer is known as the cortical bone in the bones and enamel in 
the teeth. Trabeculae, a network of minuscule holes and channels that 
line the interior of bones, are filled with bone marrow. In teeth, the 
interior contains a soft, pulpy material called the pulp, which contains 
blood vessels and nerves. 
10. 
 
Although teeth and bones share many similarities in 
composition and structure, there are significant distinctions. For 
example: (i) Teeth are not considered bones because they are unrelated 
to other body bones. Teeth are anchored in the gums and jawbone but do 
not form part of the skeletal system. (ii) Bones provide structural support 

Crl. Misc.No.10982-B/2023

for the body, protecting organs and facilitating movement. On the other 
hand, teeth are meant to break down food into little pieces that can be 
easily swallowed and digested. Teeth also play a vital role in 
communication because they aid in facial expressions and speech. (iii) 
Teeth are ectodermal organs like hair, skin, sweat glands, and salivary 
glands. Bones are living tissues. (iv) Bones undergo constant 
remodelling, whereas teeth do not. Bones can repair themselves, even 
after a significant injury, such as a fracture. In contrast, teeth are 
incapable of self-repair. If a tooth is damaged or decayed, it cannot 
recover on its own. Instead, it must be fixed with dental procedures, such 
as fillings, root canals, or crowns. (v) Bones also contain marrow, which 
produces blood cells. Teeth do not have marrow. 
11. 
 
It follows that teeth are not bones. Breaking of tooth 
constitutes Itlaf-i-salahiyyat-i-udw. This offence is punishable under 
section 336 PPC with Qisas, and if that is not executable under the 
principles of equality enunciated by Islam, the offender is liable to Arsh 
and may also be punished with imprisonment of either description for a 
term extending up to ten years as Ta’zir. Section 337-U PPC sets out the 
scale of Arsh for teeth. The Arsh for causing Itlaf of a tooth other than a 
milk tooth shall be equivalent to one-twentieth of Diyat. (The 
impairment of the portion of a tooth outside the gum amounts to causing 
Itlaf of a tooth). The Arsh for causing Itlaf of twenty or more teeth shall 
be equal to the value of Diyat. Where the Itlaf is of a milk tooth, the 
offender is liable to Daman and may also be punished with 
imprisonment of either description for a term extending to one year. 
Where, however, Itlaf of a milk tooth impedes the growth of a new 
tooth, the offender is liable to Arsh equal to one-twentieth of the Diyat. 
12. 
 
In cases of Itlaf-i-salahiyyat-i-udw, sections 332, 335, 336 
and 337-U PPC are to be read conjointly. Mr Safdar’s contention that it 
merely attracts section 337-U and the offence is punishable with Arsh 
only is misconceived. 
13. 
 
PWs Muhammad Naeem and Munir Hussain support the 
prosecution’s case. Their statements have been recorded under section 
161 Cr.P.C., which are corroborated by medical evidence. On a tentative

assessment, there is sufficient incriminating evidence against the 
Petitioner. The alleged offence is not bailable. 
14. 
 
The Petitioner has not brought any material on record which 
may suggest that the case against him is mala fide. It is a sine qua non for 
the grant of pre-arrest bail. In Muhammad Sadiq and another v. The 
State and another (2015 SCMR 1394), the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
ruled that bail before arrest is an extraordinary relief. It is meant to 
protect innocent people implicated in a criminal case for devious and 
ulterior motives. It cannot be granted unless the accused meets the 
conditions mentioned in section 497(2) Cr.P.C. He must demonstrate that 
reasonable grounds exist to believe that he is not guilty of the alleged 
offence and there are sufficient grounds to warrant further inquiry. In 
Aamir Bashir and another v. The State and others (2017 SCMR 2060), 
the Supreme Court held that apart from making out a prima facie case for 
the grant of pre-arrest bail, the accused-petitioner must show some  
mala fide on the part of the complainant and the investigating agency. 
15. 
 
I am also tempted to quote from the following excerpt from 
Shabbir Ahmad v. The State (PLD 1981 Lahore 599), a case decided by 
a Full Bench of this Court: 
“The criteria laid down in Hidayat Ullah Khan’s case (PLD 1949 Lah. 21) 
has not undergone any change so far. The three principles laid down therein 
have to be strictly followed. This power should sparingly be exercised in 
appropriate cases. The courts should strictly avoid the exercise of this power 
at random, which is likely to embarrass the prosecution in the investigation, 
as usually is the general complaint. The balance has to be kept, and each case 
has to be dealt with on its own merits. Every murderer, burglar, dacoit or 
person accused of offence disturbing the tranquillity of the State  should not 
automatically get pre-arrest bail on mere asking. The court should seriously 
apply its mind before passing the order of pre-arrest bail. I must, however, 
make it clear that Courts are the guardians of the liberty of citizens. The 
abuse of power by the police to rope in innocent persons in order to humiliate 
them and to cause irreparable loss to their reputation should be equally kept 
in view. The golden principles in Hidayat Ullah Khan's case must strictly be 
followed.” 
16. 
 
This application has no merit and is, therefore, dismissed.
