Mr. Hassan Ijaz Cheema, A.A.G. 
 
Shahid Karim, J:-. In this petition, the petitioners are 
owners of a house off Zafar Ali Road, Gulberg-V, Lahore 
(the petitioner No.1).  During these proceedings, the 
petitioners no.2, 3 and 5 withdrew their challenge and only 
petitioners No.1 and 4 sought to pursue the petition.  This 
fact does not detract from the issues of law which are 
required to be decided upon by this Court.   
2. 
The petitioners are aggrieved of the construction of an 
apartment building by respondent No.3 adjacent to the 
residential plot No.29 (off Zafar Ali Road) Gulberg-V, 
Lahore. (The disputed building) In a nub, respondent No.3 
has been granted permission by the Lahore Development 
Authority (LDA) Town Planning Wing for construction of a 
14-Storey high-rise apartment building on the residential 
plot in question.  As adumbrated a number of challenges 
have featured during the course of the oral arguments 
addressed by the learned counsel for the petitioners.  At the 

W.P No.17085 of 2022 
 
2
heart of these proceedings is the promulgation of Lahore 
Development Authority Building and Zoning Regulations, 
2019 (2019 Regulations) which were enacted pursuant to a 
change of policy by LDA for construction of apartment 
buildings at different locations within the jurisdiction of 
LDA.  Apartment building has been defined in the 2019 
Regulations as: 
“Apartment building means a building containing more 
than two apartments sharing common stair case lift or 
access spaces”. 
 
3. 
Mr. Ali Zafar, Advocate learned counsel for the 
petitioners based his challenge on a number of grounds 
which will be dealt with in seriatim. 
4. 
The first ground invokes Regulation 10.3.3 of the 2019 
Regulations which relates to multi-storey buildings and 
buildings of public assembly.  Clause ‘g’ of Regulation 
10.3.3 provides that: 
“g. NOC from EPA  
Subject to the provisions of Pakistan Environment 
Protection Act 1997, every application concerning 
following buildings shall be accompanied by an EIA and a 
No Objection Certificate from EPA. 
i. Industrial Buildings 
ii. Hospitals 
iii. Hotels 
iv. Urban Development Projects 
v. Complex of buildings on a plot of 20 Kanal or above LDA 
will conduct the EIA and cost which will be incurred on the 
study, shall be charged from the individual/owner at the 
time of approval of building plan. 
 
vi. Residential Apartment(s), Education Institution(s), 
Restaurant(s) and hotels with height above 70 feet and area 
four Kanals and above. 
 
5. 
On the strength of the above provision, the learned 
counsel for the petitioners stated that the disputed building 
falls in category ‘vi’ being a residential apartment building 
with a height of 70 feet and area of 4-Kanal and therefore 

W.P No.17085 of 2022 
 
3
would require an NOC from Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) and for an NOC to be had from EPA, the 
application must be accompanied by an EIA.  This, 
according to the learned counsel, is a sina qua non to the 
sanctioning of any apartment building and since this 
condition has gone abegging, the construction of the 
disputed 
building 
cannot 
be 
continued 
under 
any 
circumstances.   
6. 
Learned counsel for respondent No.3 and LDA 
confirmed that only an IEE was obtained for seeking 
sanction of building plan of the disputed building and 
according to them that was the only requirement and the 
construction of such buildings did not require an EIA for 
obtaining an NOC from EPA.   
7. 
Clause ‘g’ of Regulation 10.3.3 begins with the words 
“subject to the provisions of Pakistan Environment 
Protection Act, 1997”.  Therefore, the said clause and the 
pre-condition of an NOC from EPA has been made subject 
to the provisions of the 1997 Act.  It would suffice that the 
subject of environment is now within the provincial domain 
and this is not a disputed fact.  Consequently by the Punjab 
Environment Protection (Amendment) Act, 2012, necessary 
amendments have already been made to comport the 1997 
Act for the purposes of Province of Punjab.  The primary 
provision dealing 
with the requirements of Initial 
Environmental Examination (IEE) and Environmental 
Impact Assessment (EIA) have been provided in section 12 
of the 2012 Act which provides that: 
12. Initial environmental examination and environmental 
impact assessment.– (1) No proponent of a project shall 
commence construction or operation unless he has filed 

W.P No.17085 of 2022 
 
4
with the Provincial Agency an initial environmental 
examination or where the project is likely to cause an 
adverse environmental effect, an environmental impact 
assessment, and has obtained from the Provincial Agency 
approval in respect thereof. 
 
(2)  The Provincial Agency shall– 
 
(a)  review the initial environmental examination and 
accord its approval, or require submission of an 
environmental impact assessment by the proponent; or 
 
(b)  review the environmental impact assessment and 
accord its approval subject to such conditions as it 
may deem fit to impose, or require that the 
environmental impact assessment be re-submitted 
after such modifications as may be stipulated, or 
reject the project as being contrary to environmental 
objectives. 
 
(3)  Every review of an environmental impact assessment 
shall be carried out with public participation and no 
information will be disclosed during the course of such 
public participation which relates to– 
 
(i)   trade, manufacturing or business activities, processes 
or techniques of a proprietary nature, or financial, 
commercial, scientific or technical matters which the 
proponent has requested should remain confidential, 
unless for reasons to be recorded in writing, the Director - 
General of the Provincial Agency is of the opinion that the 
request for confidentiality is not well-founded or the public 
interest in the disclosure outweighs the possible prejudice 
to the competitive position of the project or its proponent; 
or 
 
(ii)  International 
relations, 
national 
security 
or 
maintenance of law and order, except with the consent of 
the Government; or 
 
(iii)  matters covered by legal professional privilege. 
 
(4)  The Provincial Agency shall communicate its approval 
or otherwise within a period of four months from the date 
the initial environmental examination or environmental 
impact assessment is filed complete in all respects in 
accordance with the prescribed procedure, failing which 
the initial environmental examination or, as the case may 
be, the environmental impact assessment shall be deemed to 
have been approved, to the extent to which it does not 
contravene the provisions of this Act and the rules and 
regulations made thereunder. 
 
(5)  Subject to sub-section (4) the Government may in a 
particular case extend the aforementioned period of four 
months if the nature of the project so warrants. 
 
(6)  The provisions of sub-sections (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) 
shall apply to such categories of projects and in such 
manner as may be prescribed. 
 
(7)  The Provincial Agency shall maintain separate Registers 
for initial environmental examination and environmental 

W.P No.17085 of 2022 
 
5
impact assessment project, which shall contain brief 
particulars of each project and a summary of decisions taken 
thereon, and which shall be open to inspection by the public 
at all reasonable hours and the disclosure of information in 
such Registers shall be subject to the restrictions specified in 
sub-section (3). 
 
8. 
At the outset, it may be reiterated that clause ‘g’ of 
Regulation 10.3.3 cannot be read in isolation and has been 
made subject to the provisions of 1997 Act (or 2012 Act) 
and it cannot be stated without fear of contradiction that an 
NOC from EPA requires an EIA as a pre-condition.  For the 
purpose, the provisions of 2012 Act will have to be read in 
conjunction with clause ‘g’ of Regulation 10.3.3.  A reading 
of section 12 of the 1997 Act would, at first blush, indicate 
that an EIA is required where a project is likely to cause an 
adverse environmental effect.  This is a general condition 
and considered literally, every project is likely to cause an 
adverse environmental effect and so would require an EIA 
for seeking an NOC from EPA.  Sub-section (6) of section 
12 however makes it clear that the provisions of sub-sections 
(1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) shall apply to such categories of 
projects and in such manner as may be prescribed and the 
term ‘prescribe’ has been defined to mean “prescribed by 
rules or regulations”.   
9. 
In this regard, learned counsel for respondent No.3 
relied upon Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency 
(Review of IEE & EIA) Regulations, 2000 (2000 
Regulations).  These were also relied upon by the learned 
counsel for the petitioners to contend that the disputed 
building is one of the projects which require an EIA in terms 
of Regulation 4 which provides that: 
 

W.P No.17085 of 2022 
 
6
“4. 
Project requiring an EIA 
A proponent of a project falling in any category listed in 
Schedule II shall file an EIA with the Federal Agency, and 
the provisions of section 12 shall apply to such project.” 
 
10. Regulation 4, set out above, provides for the projects 
requiring an EIA. A proponent of a project falling in a 
category listed in Schedule II shall file an EIA with the 
Federal Agency and the provisions of section 12 shall apply 
to such project.  These Regulations are enacted pursuant to 
sub-section (6) of section 12 of the 1997 Act and prescribe 
the projects which would require either an IEE or EIA.  The 
reliance of the learned counsel for the petitioners was 
primarily on the projects mentioned against Serial No.J (2) 
which reads: 
“(2) 
any other project likely to cause an adverse 
environmental effect”. 
  
11. The above provision is a broad based provision and 
would include any project likely to cause an adverse 
environmental effect.  This would however require a 
labeling of the project as such by the regulatory authority or 
an agency tasked with dealing with permissions to be 
granted for such projects.  In individual cases it must be held 
by that agency regarding the impact likely to be caused by 
the project on the environment and thus requiring an EIA to 
be obtained.  In my opinion, serial No. J of Schedule II to 
the 2000 Regulations does not help the cause of the 
petitioners, in that, by a circuitous route, instead of 
prescribing the category of projects which would require an 
EIA, a general provision has been made regarding projects 
likely to cause an adverse environmental effect.  The 
ineluctable conclusion would be that such project will, in 

W.P No.17085 of 2022 
 
7
any case, have to be identified by the regulator or the agency 
and label them being ones which are likely to cause an 
adverse environmental effect.  In the absence of prescribing 
such a category of projects, it cannot be argued that a certain 
project would require an EIA and must be made subject to 
the pre-condition given in clause ‘g’ of Regulation 10.3.3 of 
the 2019 Regulations.  A similar question came up for 
determination before the Sindh High Court in a judgment 
reported as Standard Chartered Bank Limited through 
Constituted Attorney v. Karachi Municipal Corporation 
through Administrator and 9 others (2015 YLR 1303) and a 
Division Bench of Sindh High Court stated that: 
“We turn to consider paragraph J:2. This appears to be a 
general or catch all provision: “Any other project likely to 
cause an adverse environmental effect”. At first sight, this 
seems reasonable enough. However, in our view, a closer 
look reveals a fundamental flaw. The reason is sub-section 
(1). It will be recalled that that requires an EIA to be filed 
in relation to a project that is likely to cause an adverse 
environmental effect. Thus, the categories of projects that 
are required to be set out in the regulations made pursuant 
to sub-section (6) are ipso facto those which are likely to 
have such an effect. Put differently, the very listing of a 
category of project in the second schedule indicates that (at 
least in the view of the environmental agency) it is likely to 
have an adverse environmental impact. Paragraph J:2 
therefore tells us nothing. It has no substantive content. It is 
circular, simply referring back to its origination (sub-
section (1)). Indeed, it may well be ultra vires the 
requirements of sub-section (6). This is so because the 
categories of projects that are required to be specified must 
be the projects that are or can be actually undertaken, and 
must therefore be those which can be identified or described 
by some measure other than their adverse environmental 
effect. This paragraph also therefore does not advance the 
petitioner’s case. “ 
 
12. Therefore, it is clear that for a project to require an 
EIA, it must be categorized as a project likely to cause an 
adverse environmental effect and this must have been done 
by LDA or EPA in the present case.  Since it has not been 
done in respect of the disputed project, it cannot be argued 
that the disputed project required an EIA as a pre condition 

W.P No.17085 of 2022 
 
8
to  the grant of an NOC by EPA.  In the present case, IEE 
would suffice.  This would also be the retort of an additional 
ground viz. that LDA does not require an EIA for such 
projects which run into hundreds and which are under 
construction in and around Lahore.  Since the regulator did 
not mean this as a condition, it cannot be argued that 
respondent No.3 commenced the construction of the 
disputed building without fulfilling the conditions imposed 
by the regulator. 
13. Learned counsel for the petitioners next referred to 
Regulation 11.1 which relates to height zones and prescribes 
the distribution of height zones.  It has been stated by 
learned counsel for LDA that height zones have already 
been notified by LDA in terms of Regulation 11.1 and there 
is no rebuttal to this fact.  A declaration of height zones has 
already been made and that declaration relates to residential 
apartments as well.  It was further contended that the 
disputed building and its construction violates Regulation 
11.3 which provides that: 
“11.3. DECLARATION OF NEW ZONES 
1. The Authority may prepare a height zone plan for an 
area to be known as height zone for High Rise, Medium 
Rise-1, Medium Rise-2, High Rise-1, High rise-2 for higher 
category of high rise to the declared category of high rise 
zones defined at 11.1 
 
2. Height zones plan so prepared may comprise any one or 
more height zones. 
 
14. Suffice to say that Regulation 11.3 is not engaged in 
this case and does not apply in the case of disputed building 
of the respondent.  Regulation 11.3 comes into effect where 
LDA intends to prescribe higher category of high rise to the 
already declared category of high rise zones defined at 11.1.  

W.P No.17085 of 2022 
 
9
This is merely a continuation of the permission granted by 
Regulation 11.2(2) which states that: 
“Moreover, any zone may be raised to any higher height 
zone from time to time as per procedure and criteria laid in 
these regulations.” 
 
15. Regulation 11.3 is the procedure and criteria which has 
been prescribed in case any zone is sought to be raised in to 
any higher height zone from time to time.  Clearly, 
Regulation 11.3 is inapplicable in these cases. 
16. Finally, the learned counsel for the petitioners 
contended that there has to be a 40 feet right of way in 
terms of Regulation 2.5 for the construction of disputed 
building.  It is the case of the petitioners that 40 feet right of 
way has not been provided by the owners of the disputed 
building. 
17. Regulation 2.5, while referring to the right of way, has 
used the expression, ‘ROW of Road.  The term ‘right of 
way’ has been defined in the 2019 Regulations to mean: 
“Right of way: means width of road /street between two 
opposite property lines”. 
 
The term ‘property line’ has also been defined as: 
“Property line: means the boundary wall of the plot”. 
18. It is clear from the definitions above, that right of way 
would mean the width of the street between to opposite 
property lines.  It does not mean merely the road on which 
vehicles are intended to ply.  It will also include, in my 
opinion, footpaths for the passengers as also green areas 
which are required to be maintained outside the buildings by 
the owners.  There is no rebuttal to the assertion that there is 
a 40 feet right of way between the property line of the 
disputed building and boundary wall of the opposite plot.  

W.P No.17085 of 2022 
 
10
Be that as it may, there is no contention that 40 feet right of 
way has to be maintained in the construction of Apartment 
buildings and since this requires a factual inquiry, LDA 
shall, at its own, ensure its compliance in letter and spirit.  
According to learned counsel for LDA a number of 
inspections have been made and the regulations have not 
been found to be violated by the owners of the disputed 
building.  This is also evident from the reply submitted by 
TEPA which granted the approval and followed up with 
inspections in this regard.   
19. Before I tear myself away, Regulation 10.3.3(g) begins 
with the words “Subject to the provisions of Pakistan 
Environment Protection Act, 1997,” (The Condition) and 
thereby engages the 1997 Act in its entirety. This part of 
Regulation 10.3.3.(g) travels beyond the primary enactment 
viz. The Lahore Development Authority Act, 1975. Such a 
condition could not be provided in the Regulations if the 
1975 Act did not place such a clog. The decision to require 
an EIA or an IEE is for the LDA to make and Regulation 
10.3.3(g) does in fact require an EIA, but for this condition. 
The policy regarding Apartment Buildings cannot be viewed 
in isolation and in the setting of one particular building only. 
The canvass has to be widened and the entire array of 
buildings being constructed and their impact on environment 
has to be at the heart of the policy. The Condition is a 
serious clog on such an effort and must be struck down. 
Consequently, LDA is directed to issue revised edition of 
2019 Regulations by deleting the Condition. Henceforth any 

W.P No.17085 of 2022 
 
11
construction of an Apartment building would require an EIA 
and No Objection Certificate for EPA. 
20. In view of the above, this petition is without merit and 
is dismissed.
