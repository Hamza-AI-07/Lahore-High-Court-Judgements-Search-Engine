AALIA NEELUM, C.J:- The appellant-Muhammad Iqbal, 
son of Fatteh Khan, Caste Gujjar, resident of Udhuwal, Tehsil & District

Rs.3,00,000/- to the legal heirs of Muhammad Ijaz (deceased). In case of 
default thereof, to further undergo 06-months S.I each.  
2. 
 
Feeling aggrieved by the trial court’s judgment, Muhammad 
Iqbal, the appellant, has assailed his conviction and sentence by filing the 
instant appeal bearing Criminal Appeal No.48876-J of 2019. The trial court 
also sent M.R. No.185 of 2019 (The State. Vs. Muhammad Iqbal) to 
confirm the death sentence awarded to the appellant, Muhammad Iqbal. 
Whereas the complainant also filed Crl. Appeal No. 44259 of 2019 against 
the acquittal of respondents Nos.1 to 7, namely Mukhtar Ahmed, Iftikhar 
Ahmed alias Yar Muhammad, Muhammad Shafi, Altaf Hussain, Ali Raza, 
Ashiq Ali and Yousaf. All the matters arising from the same judgment of the 
trial court are being disposed of through a single judgment. 
3. 
 
The prosecution story, as alleged in the F.I.R (Ex. PD) lodged 
on the statement (Ex. PA) of Muhammad Arshad (PW-1)-the complainant, is 
that he (PW-1) alongwith his brother Muhammad Ilyas alias Amjad (PW-2) 
while boarding on motorcycle Honda 125/CG was going to village Udhowal 
Khurd to see his brother-in-law (بہنوئی), namely Ch. Muhammad Shafaat; 
when they reached Service Morr, he (PW-1) met with Muhammad Afzal 
(PW-4), brother of Ch. Shafaat, who told that Ch. Shafaat was sitting at Al-
Rehman Builders, Rehman Shaheed Road, Gujrat; after that, they all three 
went there. In the meanwhile, nephew (بھانجا) of the complainant, namely 
Ijaz Ahmad while boarding on motorcycle came there for taking his father 
Muhammad Shafaat; Muhammad Shafaat insisted them to go to his home at 
village Udhowal; Muhammad Shafaat boarded on the motorcycle of his son 
Ijaz, whereas, the complainant (PW-1), Muhammad Ilyas alias Amjad (PW-
2) and Muhammad Afzal (PW-4) boarded on their motorcycle and 
proceeded to village Udhowal; Ijaz and Muhammad Shafaat were going 
ahead on motorcycle and the complainant and others were following them; 
when they reached Udhowal road near water tank, it was about 07:15 p.m., 
accused persons Muhammad Iqbal (the appellant), Moazzam (since P.O), 
Iftikhar alias Yar Muhammad (since acquitted), Rehman Ali alias Mana 
(since P.O), Muhammad Shafi (since acquitted), Ali (since acquitted), Altaf

Ahmad (since acquitted), Mukhtar Ahmad (since acquitted), Yousaf (since 
acquitted) and Ashiq (since acquitted) had already waylaid there while 
armed with deadly weapons; Muhammad Iqbal (the appellant) raised a 
lalkara that Shafaat and Ijaz might not be let alive that day and made fire 
with his weapon, which hit Ijaz Ahmad (deceased), Moazzam (since P.O) 
made a fire with his weapon, which hit Muhammad Shafaat (the deceased); 
upon receiving injuries, they both fell down from motorcycle; Rehmat Ali 
(since P.O) made a fire with his weapon, which hit Muhamad Shafaat (the 
deceased); Iftikhar Ahmad alias Yar Muhammad (since acquitted) also made 
a fire with his weapon, which hit Ijaz Ahmad (the deceased); Muhammad 
Shafi, Ali, Altaf Ahmad, Mukhtar Ahmad, Yousaf and Ashiq (all co-accused 
since acquitted) also made firing with their weapons, which hit Ijaz and 
Muhammad Shafaat; accused persons also raised lalkaras to get satisfaction 
about their death; after satisfaction about death of Muhammad Shafaat and 
Ijaz Ahmad, all the accused persons went away while raising lalkaras and 
making firing from the spot. Due to fear, the complainant and PWs did not 
go near; when the accused persons went away, they attended to Muhammad 
Shafaat and Ijaz Ahmad, who succumbed to the injuries. The accused 
persons committed the incident on the abetment of Shahbaz and Bhuttoo 
(co-accused since P.O), who sent messages of threats on different occasions, 
and witnesses of the said fact were Basharat Ali and Jawad Ali. The motive 
behind the occurrence was a dispute over land, due to which hot words were 
exchanged between Muhammad Iqbal (the appellant) and Muhammad Shafi, 
etc. with Muhammad Shafaat prior to this occurrence, for which accused 
persons had extended threats of death to Muhammad Shafaat.  
4. 
 
After the incident, the complainant reported the matter to the 
police through his oral complaint (Ex. PA), and after that, formal F.I.R (Ex. 
PD) was chalked out by Muhammad Asghar S.I (PW-7). After the 
registration of the case, the investigation of this case was entrusted to Shahid 
Husnain S.I (PW-15), who found the accused/appellant guilty, prepared a 
report under Section 173, Cr.P.C., and sent the same to the court of 
competent jurisdiction. On 09.05.2015, the trial court formally charge-

sheeted the appellant, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In 
support of its version, the prosecution produced as many as fifteen (15) 
witnesses.  
5.

of Muhammad Arshad (PW-1)-the complainant, Muhammad Ilyas (PW-2), 
and Muhammad Afzal (PW-4)-the eye witness, whereas Dr. Yasir Ali (PW-

Firearms caused all the injuries. The probable time between injuries and 
death was almost immediately, whereas between death and postmortem was 
08 to 12 hours.  
6. 
 
The learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor gave up PWs 
Muhammad Sikandar, Naeem ud Din 1247/C, Jawad Ali, and Nafees Akhtar 
2667/C as unnecessary and PWs Zahoor Ellahi and Muhammad Hanif 
1386/C as dead. The prosecution evidence was closed after tendering reports 
of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (Ex. PDD and Ex. PEE). 
7. 
 
The appellant was also examined in terms of Section 342 
Cr.P.C., wherein he neither opted to appear as his own witness in terms of 
Section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor opted to produce any evidence in his defence. In 
response to a particular question about why this case was against him and 
why the PWs deposed against him, the appellant made the following 
deposition: - 
“I am innocent. Neither I nor any other co-
accused is involved in this alleged occurrence in 
any manner. None of the eye witness was 
present at the alleged time and place of 
occurrence. None of the cited eye witnesses have 
seen the occurrence and at a much belated stage 
with much delay they got information regarding 
death of deceased persons and thereafter they 
came in the picture. This case was got 
registered after much delay and after joining 
hands with the police with concocted, fabricated 
and false version against the real facts. 
Deceased Shafaat was ex-police employee and 
for this reason as well police joined hands with 
the complainant party for getting this case 
registered at a belated stage but with ante time 
proceedings and against the real facts. As actual 
assailants could not be seen and identified by 
any person hence, for causing blackmailing and 
harassment to me and other co-accused, we 
were roped in this case for fetching my property 
and remaining co-accused have been falsely 
roped in this case for their relationship with me 
and for causing blackmailing to them also. The 
other co-accused have also been roped in this 
case for keeping them refrain from making

protest over false registration of case against me 
and also against them. There was no dispute of 
any land between me and Shafaat Hussain 
deceased and no threats have ever been issued 
by me to deceased Shafaat Husain and fake 
motive has been introduced by the complainant 
party. All the PWs are close relatives of 
complainant, therefore, they have deposed 
falsely against me and other co-accused 
persons.”      
 
8. 
 
After evaluating the evidence available on record in light of 
arguments advanced by both sides, the trial court found the prosecution 
version proved beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt, which resulted in 
the appellant’s conviction and sentence in the above terms.  
9. 
 
We have given our anxious and most thoughtful consideration 
to both sides’ rival submissions. We have minutely gone through the 
evidence on record.  
10. 
 
In the instant case, the incident occurred at 07:15 p.m. on 
23.06.2014 at Udhowal road near “water Tainki” situated within the 
jurisdiction of Police Station, Civil Line, District Gujrat, which is at a 
distance of 1½-kilometers from the place of occurrence. Muhammad Arshad 
(PW-1)-the complainant, brother-in-law and maternal cousin (Mamu Zaad) 
of Shafaat (the deceased) and maternal uncle of Ijaz (the deceased) reported 
the incident through oral complaint (Ex. PA) to Shahid Husnain, S.I. (PW-
15) at 08:00 p.m. at the place of occurrence, i.e. Uddowal Khurd, who 
reached the place of occurrence upon receiving information of the incident 
and he (PW-15) incorporated police proceedings (Ex.PA/2) and referred the 
same through Naeem-ud-Din 1239/C (given up PW) to the police station, 
based on which, formal F.I.R. (Exh. PD) was chalked out on the same day at 
08:20 p.m. by Muhammad Asghar S.I (PW-7). Admittedly, both the 
deceased are father and son. Muhammad Arshad (PW-1), the complainant, 
took forty-five minutes to report the incident to the police. During the 
examination-in-chief, Muhammad Arshad (PW-1), the complainant deposed 
that:-

“At the spot on the same day, I made statement 
to Thanidar and I signed the same in English 
which is Ex. PA.  
Similar statements were made by Muhammad Ilyas (PW-2) and Muhammad 
Afzal (PW-4). The prosecution story is silent about why Muhammad Arshad 
(PW-1), the complainant, Muhammad Ilyas (PW-2), and Muhammad Afzal 
(PW-4) had not reported the incident to the police and what they were doing 
on the spot for 45 minutes, whereas the prosecution's case is that both 
Shafaat (the deceased) and Ijaz (the deceased) sustained injuries and 
scummed on the spot immediately. It indicates that they were not present at 
the spot. The complainant lodged the first information report 45 minutes 
after the alleged incident, whereas the police station was 1-1/2 kilometers 
from the place of occurrence. Time and again, the object and importance of 
prompt lodging of the first information report have been highlighted. Delays 
in lodging the First Information report often result in embellishment and 
exaggeration, a creature of an afterthought. A delayed report not only gets 
bereft of the advantage of spontaneity, the danger of introducing a colored 
version of the incident, or a concocted story as a result of deliberations and 
consultations, but also creeps in, casting serious doubt on its veracity. 
Therefore, the delay in lodging the report must be satisfactorily explained. 
As per the prosecution case, the incident took place at 07:15 p.m., and the 
matter was reported to police at 08:00 p.m. at the place of occurrence. 
Whereas, in the inquest report of Muhammad Shafaat-the deceased 
(Ex.PS/A), in column No.3 regarding receiving information of death and 
time, only the date, i.e., 23.06.2014, has been mentioned, and time has not 
been given. Shahid Husnain S.I (PW-15)-the investigating officer admitted 
during cross-examination that Fard Biyan (Ex. PA) does not bear the 
signatures of a medical officer. Even on the last page of inquest reports 
(Ex.PS/A & Ex.PS/B), the columns of signatures and names of respectable 
persons in the vicinity are not mentioned. Shahid Husnain S.I. (PW-15)-the 
investigating officer admitted during cross-examination that he had not 
mentioned the names and respectable of the vicinity, nor has he mentioned 
the same on the last pages of inquest reports. The delay in conducting the 

Murder Reference No.185 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.48876-J of 2019 & 
Crl. Appeal No.44259 of 2019 
 
 
 
 
10
postmortem examination from the time of the commission of the offence 
renders the whole of the prosecution story doubtful. Shahid Husnain S.I. 
(PW-15)-the investigating officer admitted during cross-examination that: - 
“It is correct that I have not shown the time in 
column No. 3 of inquest report Ex.P-S/B.--------
It is correct that I had not obtained the 
signatures of respectables of the area at the 
bottom of inquest reports of Muhammad 
Shafaat Ex.P-S/A and Muhammad Ijaz Ex.P-
S/B.”  
Shahid Husnain (PW-15)-the investigating officer deposed that after 
recording the oral statement of Muhammad Arshad (PW-1)-the complainant, 
he transmitted the same to the police station for registration of formal FIR 
through Naeem Ud Din 1239/C (given up PW). After that, he (PW-15) 
inspected the dead bodies and drafted inquest reports (Ex.PS/A and 
Ex.PS/B) of Muhammad Shafaat and Muhammad Ijaz, respectively, 
applications for postmortem examination (Ex. PT and Ex. PU) of 
Muhammad Shafaat (deceased) and Muhammad Ijaz (Ex. PU); he also 
drafted injury statement (Ex. PV and Ex. PX) of Muhammad Shafaat and 
Muhammad Ijaz respectively and handed over the dead body of Muhammad 
Shafaat to Ashiq Ali 3629/C (PW-8) and dead body of Muhammad Ijaz to 
Mudassar Iqbal 147/C (PW-10) for postmortem examination. Ashiq Ali 
3629/C (PW-8) deposed in his examination-in-chief that on 23.06.2014, the 
dead body of Shafaat Hussain, along with police papers, was entrusted to 
him for the postmortem examination, and he escorted the dead body to ABS 
Hospital, Gujrat for postmortem examination. He (PW-8) admitted during 
cross-examination that I.O. had not recorded his statement about the 
entrustment of a dead body to him for the postmortem examination of 
deceased Shafaat Hussain on 23.06.2014. In similar words, Mudassar Iqbal 
1473/C (PW-10) deposed. Mudassar Iqbal 1473/C (PW-10) also admitted 
during cross-examination that I.O had not recorded his statement about 
the entrustment of the dead body to him for the postmortem examination of 
deceased Ijaz Ahmad on 23.06.2014. Dr. Yasir Ali (PW-13) deposed in his 
examination in chief that: -

Crl. Appeal No.44259 of 2019

“According to police paper the death occurred 
at 7:15 pm, on 23.06.2014. Dead body was 
received in dead house at 10:00 pm, on 
23.06.2014. I received complete documents from 
police at 3:30 am, on 24.06.2014. I conducted 
autopsy at 4:00 am, on 24.06.2014.” 
In similar lines, Dr. Yasir Ali (PW-13) deposed about the receiving of the 
dead body of Muhammad Ijaz (the deceased) on 23.06.2014 during 
examination-in-chief. Dr. Yasir Ali (PW-13) further deposed during 
examination-in-chief that: - 
“Carbon copy of post mortem report is Ex.P-Q 
and its diagrams are Ex.P-Q/1 and Ex.P-Q/2 
which are in my hand and signed by me.” He 
(PW-10) also deposed during examination-in-
chief that, “Carbon copy of post mortem report 
is Ex.P-R and its diagrams are Ex.P-R/1 and 
Ex.P-R/2 which are in my hand and signed by 
me.” 
 
 
It is an admitted fact that Dr. Yasir Ali (PW-13), who 
conducted postmortem reports on the dead bodies of Muhammad Shafaat 
and Muhammad Ijaz (the deceased), has not signed any document except 
postmortem reports (Ex. PQ and Ex. PR). Although it is the prosecution case 
that the incident took place at 07:15 p.m. on 23.06.2014, the matter was 
reported to the police at the spot at 08:00 p.m. on 23.06.2014. However, 
during cross-examination, Dr. Yasir Ali (PW-13) admitted that he only 
signed postmortem reports (Ex. PQ and Ex. PR). If police documents, i.e., 
Fard Biyan (Ex. PA), FIR (Ex. PD), injury statements, inquest reports, and 
applications for conducting postmortem reports were handed over to the 
doctor before the postmortem of the dead bodies, the same should have been 
signed by the medical officer. Even Dr. Yasir Ali (PW-13) was also unable 
to mention in the postmortem reports (Ex. PQ and Ex. PR) that injuries were 
ante mortem in nature; during cross-examination, he admitted that he had 
not mentioned in the postmortem reports that injuries were ante-mortem or 
post-mortem. He (PW-13) also admitted during the cross-examination that: - 
“It is correct that in the post mortem report of 
deceased Shafaat Hussain Ex.P-Q, the column

as to age of deceased is blank.-------It is correct 
that the column as to CNIC and relationship 
with deceased is also blank.-------------It is 
correct that I have not specified under the 
description of injuries that the same were fire 
arm injuries. Volunteer states that I have 
specified under my opinion that the nature of 
injuries was fire arm injuries.---------It is 
correct that under the opinion given in the post 
mortem report the nature of injuries was not 
shown as fire arm injuries., It is correct that I 
have not specified the words “exit and entry 
wounds” under the description of injuries. 
Volunteer states that I have used the word 
inverted and everted margins.--------------It is 
incorrect to suggest that the reason for non-
mentioning of nature of injuries as to exit or 
entry wound is that I was not sure that the 
injuries were either caused by fire arm or not. 
It is correct that every injury of every nature 
has margins of different nature. It is correct 
that I have not specified the number on injuries 
in pictorial diagrams. It is correct that I have 
not specified in my opinion that the injuries 
were ante mortem or post mortem. It is correct 
that I had seen the dead body in mortuary for 
the first time at the time of conducting post 
mortem examination. It is correct that I had 
mentioned the time of receipt of dead body in 
the post mortem report as 10:00 pm when

examination.------------It is correct that in the 
post mortem report of deceased Ijaz Ex.P-R, 
the column as to CNIC and relationship with 
deceased is blank.---------It is correct that I have 
not specified under the description of injuries 
that the same were firearm injuries. Volunteer 
states that I have specified under my opinion 
that the nature of injuries was fire arm 
injuries.------------It is correct that under the 
opinion given in the post mortem report the 
nature of injuries was not shown as fire arm 
injuries. It is correct that I have not specified 
the words “Exit and entry wounds” under the 
description of injuries. Volunteer states that I 
have used the word inverted and everted 
margins.----------------- It is correct that I have 
not specified the number on injuries in pictorial 
diagrams. It is correct that I have not specified

in my opinion that the injuries were ante 
mortem or post mortem. It is correct that I had 
seen the dead body in mortuary for the first 
time at the time of conducting post mortem 
examination. It is correct that I had mentioned 
the time of receipt of dead body in the post 
mortem report as 10:00 pm when police told me 
at the time of post mortem examination.” 
Muhammad Ilyas (PW-2) deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“I don’t know when postmortem examination 
over dead bodies of the deceased of this case 
was performed.” 
Muhammad Arif (PW-12), the identifier of the dead bodies, deposed during 
cross-examination that: - 
“It is correct that my statement u/s 161 of 
Cr.P.C. as to the identification of the dead body 
was not recorded by the I.O.” 
Shahid Husnain S.I. (PW-15)-the investigating officer admitted during 
cross-examination that: - 
“It is correct that carbon copy of fard biyan 
available on the police file does not bear the 
proceedings of duty officer. It is correct that 
fard biyan Ex.P-A does not bear the signatures 
of Medical Officer.----------It is correct that I 
have not specified the registration number and 
model of motorcycle in the use of eye witnesses 
in the whole record. I do not remember whether 
I had dispatched the copy of FIR to the Medical 
Officer at the time of post mortem or not. It is 
correct that in the case diaries of record of this 
case I have not mentioned that the eye witnesses 
were present at the place of occurrence when I 
got visited draftsman to the place of occurrence. 
Volunteers states that it is specified in the 
record that complainant was present.” 
 
 
Dr. Yasir Ali (PW-13) deposed that the duration between 
injuries and death of both the deceased, i.e., Muhammad Shafaat and 
Muhammad Ijaz, was immediate, while the probable time between death and 
postmortem was 08 to 12 hours. Admittedly, an autopsy on the dead body of 

Murder Reference No.185 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.48876-J of 2019 & 
Crl. Appeal No.44259 of 2019 
 
 
 
 
14
Muhammad Shafaat, the deceased, was conducted at 04:00 a.m. on 
24.06.2014, and the autopsy on the dead body of Muhammad Ijaz, the 
deceased, was conducted at 04:30 a.m. on 24.06.2014. There is a delay in 
conducting a postmortem examination on the bodies of the deceased from 
the time when the incident was reported to the police. There is no plausible 
explanation as to why the postmortem of the dead bodies was delayed for 
eight hours and forty-five minutes from the time of reporting the occurrence. 
This aspect of the matter is sufficient to cast doubt about the authenticity of 
the F.I.R. This creates serious doubt about the genuineness of the 
prosecution story, including the complainant's presence at the scene of the 
occurrence. Delays in lodging the FIR often result in embellishment, a 
creature of an afterthought.  
11. 
 
It is the prosecution case that on 23.06.2014, Muhammad 
Arshad (PW-1)-the complainant, alongwith his brother Muhammad Ilyas 
(PW-2), while boarding on motorcycle 125 Honda were proceeding to 
Uddowal Khurd to see Muhammad Shafaat, the deceased; when they 
reached Service Mor Gujrat, Muhammad Afzal (PW-4), brother of 
Muhammad Shafaat met them and he informed them that Shafaat was 
residing at Show Room situated at Rehman Builder, Rehman Shaheed Road, 
on which Muhammad Arshad (PW-1)-the complainant, Muhammad Ilyas 
(PW-2)-the eye witness and Muhammad Afzal (PW-4) while boarding on 
the same motorcycle proceeded and reached Show Room situated at Rehman 
Builder, Rehman Shaheed Road for meeting with Shafaat. Muhammad 
Shafaat asked Muhammad Arshad (PW-1), the complainant, Muhammad 
Ilyas (PW-2), and Muhammad Afzal (PW-4), the eyewitnesses, to come with 
him to his house. The complainant and the witnesses boarded on a 
motorcycle and left with him for his house. Shafaat (the deceased) boarded 
the motorcycle with his son Ijaz (the deceased). Shafaat and Ijaz were ahead 
of Muhammad Arshad (PW-1)-the complainant, Muhammad Ilyas (PW-2), 
and Muhammad Afzal (PW-4) when they reached the Water tank near 
Uddowal at about 7:00/7:15 p.m, the incident took place. Admittedly, all the 
witnesses are chance witnesses.

Even 
Muhammad 
Arshad 
(PW-1), 
the 
complainant, 
Muhammad Ilyas (PW-2), and Muhammad Afzal (PW-4), the eyewitnesses, 
had made dishonest improvements in his examination-in-chief. The defence 
has confronted the court statements of these witnesses with their earlier 
statements made before the investigating officer. Muhammad Arshad (PW-
1)-the complainant deposed during cross-examination that:- 
“I got recorded in my statement Ex.DA to 
police that we inquired him (Afzal) about 
presence of Shafat at home. (Confronted with 
Ex.DA where it is not so mentioned). I got 
recorded in my statement Ex.DA that Shafat 
was “at show room situated at Rehman 
Builders”. (confronted with Ex.DA where show 
room is not so mentioned). I got recorded in my 
statement Ex.DA to police that we including 
Afzal aforementioned “while boarding on same 
motorcycle proceeded and reached at the above 
said showroom” (confronted with Ex.DA where 
while boarding on the same motorcycle and 
above said show room is not mentioned, 
however it is recorded in Ex.DA that we said 03 
persons went there. I did not mention in my 
statement Ex.DA about the time as 07:00 PM. I 
got mentioned in my statement Ex.DA to police 
that fires made by Shafi, Ali Raza, Altaf, 
Mukhtar, Yousaf and Ashiq hit at different 
parts of the bodies of both Shafat and Ejaz 
above mentioned. Confronted with Ex.DA 
where hitting of said fires at different parts of 
body of both Shafat and Ejaz not mentioned. I 
got mentioned in Ex.DA that this occurrence 
was witnessed by me, Ilyas and Muhammad 
Afzal PWs. Confronted with Ex.DA where it is 
not so mentioned.” 
Muhammad Ilyas (PW-2)-the eye witness deposed during cross-examination 
that: - 
“I got mentioned in my statement Ex.DB before 
police that Afzal also boarded with us on our 
motorcycle. Confronted with Ex.DB where it is 
not mentioned. I got mentioned in my statement 
Ex.DB before police that Shafat suggested for 
making further conversation there at home. 
Confronted with Ex.DB where it is not

mentioned. I got recorded in my statement 
Ex.DB that whereas we three boarded on our 
motorcycle. Confronted with Ex.DB where it is 
not so mentioned. I did not mentioned in my 
statement before police that we reached at 
“Uddowal”. Volunteers that I mentioned “near 
water tank, Uddowal road”. Confronted with 
Ex.DB where Uddowal road is not mentioned.---
-----------I mentioned time of occurrence at 
about 07/07:15 PM in my statement before 
police in this case. Confronted with Ex.DB 
where 07:00 PM as time not mentioned. I got 
mentioned in my statement Ex.DB before police 
that this occurrence was witnessed by me, 
Muhammad Afzal and Muhammad Arshad 
PW. Confronted with Ex.DB where it is not so 
recorded.” 
Muhammad Afzal (PW-4)-the eyewitness deposed during cross-examination 
that: - 
“I do not remember whether I stated before 
police in my statement that “I also boarded on 
their motorcycle”. Confronted with Ex.DE 
where it is not recorded. I got recorded in my 
statement before police that I alongwith 
Muhammad Arshad and Ilyas PWs witnessed 
the occurrence. Confronted with Ex.DE where 
it is not so recorded.” 
 
 
In the instant case, the prosecution witnesses, i.e., Muhammad 
Arshad (PW-1)-the complainant, Muhammad Ilyas (PW-2), and Muhammad 
Afzal (PW-4), are not only related inter se but also to the deceased. Even 
their presence at the spot is not established. The prosecution has no 
sufficient proof that the FIR (Ex. PD) was recorded at the given time after 
the occurrence, as discussed above. The delay in conducting the postmortem 
also revealed that the FIR was not registered at the given time. The 
conclusion arrives that there is no credible evidence to establish that the 
PWs were present at the place of occurrence. We scanned the prosecution 
evidence and found that Muhammad Arshad (PW-1)-the complainant 
admitted during cross-examination that: - 

Murder Reference No.185 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.48876-J of 2019 & 
Crl. Appeal No.44259 of 2019

“Jawar crop was at its full height during the 
days of occurrence. Height of “Jawar” and 
“Milt” crops usually risers up to 6/7 feets.” 
Asif Akhter Naqash draftsman (PW-6) admitted during cross-examination 
that: - 
“It is correct that the point No.9 shown in the 
scaled site plan Ex.P-D is in front of all the 
accused persons. It is correct that the point No.9 
is not on the back or sides of the accused 
persons shown in the site plan Ex.P-D. It is 
correct that I have not specified the distance of 
point No.9 from remaining points shown in the 
site plan Ex.P-D.” 
 
 
On perusal of the site plan (Ex. PY), it reveals that between the 
deceased and accused persons, there was a “Jawar” crop, and the appellant 
was shown at point No.3, while the deceased was at points No.1 & 2. The 
distance between points Nos.1, 2 & 3 was 10 feet, whereas between points 
No.1,2 & 8 was 40 feet. As per the site plan, the witnesses witnessed the 
incident from point “8”, which was 40 feet away from points No.1 & 2. The 
presence of the appellant-Muhammad Iqbal, was shown at point No.3, which 
was 10 feet ahead of point No.1. It is not possible that the witnesses 
witnessed the incident from 40/50 feet when there was “Jawar” crop 
standing between the assailants and the deceased. This all throws a cloud of 
doubt into the deposition of witnesses. Even during cross-examination, the 
prosecution witnesses deliberately concealed the facts confronted by the 
defence. Muhammad Arshad (PW-1)-the complainant deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“Shafat one of the deceased was Ex-police 
employee. Volunteered that he served in police 
department for about 10 years. Shahjahan is 
son of Shafat deceased of the case. ------- It is 
not in my knowledge that a sodomy case was 
registered 
against 
Shahjahan 
and 
Kashi 
aforementioned. The FIR about dispute of 
money of Trawler was registered against me 
and not against Shafat deceased of this case. ---- 
It is not in my knowledge that Shafat deceased 
was doing business of giving money to the

people and then to receive money as profit on 
the same and so many disputes arose due to said 
business. ------------- I also joined investigation 
alongwith cited eye witnesses of this case on 
27.09.2014. I have not made statement during 
investigation on 27.09.2014 before I.O to the 
effect that Altaf, Ali Raza, Yousaf and Ashiq 
accused persons have no role in the occurrence 
and Shafi also did not take part in the 
occurrence. ---------- Confronted with Ex.DA 
where it is so mentioned.” 
Muhammad Ilyas (PW-2)-the eyewitness deposed during cross-examination 
that: - 
“It is incorrect to suggest that on 27.09.2014, I 
made statement to I.O of this case that Altaf, 
Ali Raza, Yousaf, Ashiq accused persons have 
no role in the occurrence and Shafi accused had 
also not taken part in the occurrence. ------------- 
on direction of the court learned DDPP 
provided copy to learned defence counsel of 
purported “Daryaft” of said PW Muhammad 
Ilyas statedly got recorded on 27.09.2014. 
Confronted with Ex. DC purported Daryaft 
dated 27.09.2014, where it is so recorded.” 
Muhammad Afzal (PW-4)-the eyewitness deposed during cross-examination 
that: - 
“It is not in my knowledge that Ejaz deceased 
was beaten thrice due to his nefarious activities, 
by the villagers. It is not in my knowledge that 
Shafat was used to give money to the persons 
and then get profit on the same on monthly 
basis. It is also not in my knowledge that due to 
said reason he had earned scattered enmity in 
and around the vicinity with lots of persons 
over said interest/profit and money.----------It is 
not in my knowledge that Shafat deceased was 
used to come to police station and getting 
moved applications from different persons 
against other persons by using his former police 
employment and due to said reason he was used 
to blackmail and harass the different persons 
and extract money. It is also not in my 
knowledge that due to said reason he had 
developed lot of annoyance and enmity in and

around the vicinity and he was even himself 
used to make such frivolous applications against 
different persons. -------------- I did not joined 
investigation on 27.09.2014. it is incorrect to 
suggest that I joined investigation on 27.09.2014 
and also made statement to the police/IO on 
that 
day. 
----------------- 
Confronted 
with 
Ex.DD/purported statement/daryaft where it is 
so recorded. I got recorded in my statement 
before police that Muhammad Ilyas and 
Muhammad Arshad told me “that they are 
going Uddowal”. Confronted with Ex.DE where 
it is not recorded.” 
 
 
 These witnesses improved their version about the acquitted 
accused. It reveals that the prosecution witnesses deliberately concealed the 
facts. 
12. 
 
It is admitted that the prosecution witnesses are interested and 
inimical towards the appellant. About the relationship between Muhammad 
Arshad (PW-1)-the complainant; Muhammad Ilyas (PW-2) eyewitness; 
Muhammad Afzal (PW-4)-eyewitness, Shafaat deceased and Ijaz deceased is 
concerned; Muhammad Arshad (PW-1)-the complainant admitted during 
cross-examination that: - 
“Shafaat deceased was my “Behnoi” and the 
same is the position of Ishrat PW, I and Shafaat 
deceased were also inter-se cousins being 
“Mamu Zad” and “Phuphi Zad” respectively, 
same is position of Ishrat PW, Sikandar PW is 
Chacha Zad” of Shafaat deceased, Ilyas PW is 
my real brother and he is also having same 
relation with Shafaat deceased as of mine. 
Afzal/PW is real brother of Shafaat deceased. 
Jawad/PW 
is 
son 
of 
Shafaat 
deceased. 
Basharat/PW is “Bhanja” of Shafaat deceased 
and resident of village “Karnana”. Arif/PW is 
“Phuphi Zad” of Shafaat deceased. Zahoor 
Elahi/PW was “Hum Zulf” of Shafaat deceased 
of the case.”  
 
 
The prosecution witnesses were not only inimical towards the 
accused but were also closely related to the deceased, and they had reasons 
to implicate the accused falsely. There is no independent evidence to 

Murder Reference No.185 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.48876-J of 2019 & 
Crl. Appeal No.44259 of 2019 
 
 
 
 
20
corroborate the evidence of the witnesses interested in this case. In this 
background, as far as motive is concerned, it is a double-edged sword that 
cuts both sides/ways. Muhammad Arshad (PW-1)-the complainant deposed 
about the motive behind the occurrence during examination-in-chief that: - 
“Motive behind the occurrence was dispute 
about land, due to which Iqbal etc had even 
earlier issued threats to Shafaat at home.------
On 11.07.2014 I alongwith Ishrat and Sikandar 
appeared before Thanidar and produced a 
Court order to Thanidar which was comprising 
upon four pages, which was taken into 
possession by him vide recovery memo Ex.PB 
attested by us, said order PB/1-4.”  
The scanned copy of the application for registration of the case (Ex. P1/1) is 
as follows: -  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The stamp imposed on the face of the application for 
registration of the case (Ex. P1/1) reveals that the application was presented 
on 12.06.2012, and the date under the signature of the District and Sessions 
Judge Gujrat was also mentioned 12.06.2012. Contrary to the contents of the 

Murder Reference No.185 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.48876-J of 2019 & 
Crl. Appeal No.44259 of 2019 
 
 
 
 
21
application for registration of the case (Ex. P1/1), Basharat Ali (PW-14) 
deposed during examination-in-chief that: - 
“Stated 
that 
on 
25.05.2014, 
accused 
Muhammad Iqbal and I alongwith Jawad PW 
were present at the dera of Ch. Shafaat Hussain 
as there was a dispute of property between Ch. 
Shafaat 
Hussain 
deceased 
and 
accused 
Muhammad Iqbal present before the court. We 
had gathered there to settle the dispute of 
property. In the meantime, accused Iqbal 
present before the Court received a telephone 
call from accused persons Bhutto and Shahzad 
(since P.Os) that accused Iqbal opened the 
speaker and I heard the conversation between 
them. Accused Shahbaz and Bhutto (both since 
P.Os) were instigating accused Iqbal to murder 
Ijaz and Shafaat. I made my statement before 
the I.O in this regard.” 
Muhammad Ishrat (PW-5) also admitted during cross-examination that: -  
“I joined investigation of this case. I have not 
made any statement to the police in this case.” 
 
 
The contents of the application for registration of the case (Ex. 
P1/1) reveal that Muhammad Ishrat (PW-5) was not present with Shafaat 
(deceased) and Ijaz (deceased) on 25.05.2014. Instead, Muhammad Sikandar 
(given up being unnecessary) allegedly witnessed the alleged occurrence on 
25.05.2014. Therefore, an adverse inference is to be drawn within the 
meaning of Article 129 (g) of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, that had 
Muhammad Sikandar (given up being unnecessary) been produced as a 
witness. His testimony would have been unfavorable to the prosecution.  
Reliance is placed on the case reported as “The State and others   v.  Abdul 
Khaliq and others” (PLD 2011 SC 554). As per the prosecution version put 
forth in the crime report by the complainant, Muhammad Iqbal, the appellant 
issued threats to Shafaat, deceased, over a land dispute. Muhammad Ilyas 
(PW-2) deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“I did not get mentioned in my statement 
Ex.DB the words “due to this motive even 
earlier” hot words exchanged.”  
Muhammad Afzal (PW-4) deposed during cross-examination that: - 

Murder Reference No.185 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.48876-J of 2019 & 
Crl. Appeal No.44259 of 2019 
 
 
 
 
22
“I don’t remember that I mentioned to police in 
my statement that words “on which earlier” 
were recorded by me or not. Confronted with 
Ex.DE where these words are not mentioned.”  
 
 
A concocted story about the motive appears to have been 
cooked up, and it cannot be believed only based on the complainant and 
prosecution witnesses’ oral statements. As is evident from the above 
deposition, the prosecution has failed to prove the motive part of the 
occurrence, which is shrouded in mystery. Thus, the prosecution has failed 
to provide evidence of a clear motive. Motive is a doubt-edge weapon for 
the occurrence and false implication. There are always different motives 
operating in a person's mind when making accusations. On the other hand, 
Muhammad Arshad (PW-1), the complainant, shows his lack of knowledge 
about Shafaat deceased and Ijaz deceased character and their daily affairs; he 
(PW-1) deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“Shafat one of the deceased was Ex-police 
employee. Volunteered that he served in police 
department for about 10 years. Shahjahan is 
son of Shafat deceased of the case-------It is not 
in my knowledge that a sodomy case was 
registered 
against 
Shahjahan 
and 
Kashi 
aforementioned. The FIR about dispute of 
money of Trawler was registered against me 
and not against Shafat deceased of this case. ----
------It is not in my knowledge that Shafat 
deceased was doing business of giving money to 
the people and then to receive money as profit 
on the same and so many disputes arose due to 
said business.”  
Muhammad Ilyas (PW-2) deposed during cross-examination that: -  
“I 
am 
brother 
of 
Muhammad 
Arshad 
complainant of this case. I am related to Shafat 
deceased of this case, he was my cousin being 
“Mamuzad”. My sister is widow of Shafat 
deceased as she was married with him. I know 
Shahjahan s/o Shafat deceased and Kashif alias 
Kashi s/o Akhtar. It is not in my knowledge that 
a case regarding sodomy was registered against 
them.--------It is not in my knowledge that case 
regarding dispute of money of Trawler was 
registered against Shafat deceased. It is even

Crl. Appeal No.48876-J of 2019 & 
Crl. Appeal No.44259 of 2019 
 
 
 
 
23
not in my knowledge that any such case was 
registered against any person. -------- It is not in 
my knowledge that Ejaz deceased was giving 
beating by the people due to his nefarious 
activities and he was ill reputed person. I don’t 
remember that Shafat deceased was used to 
give money to the person and then fetch profit 
on the same on monthly basis. --------- Shafat 
deceased might had been companying persons 
and moving their applications to police stations 
and then taking part in proceedings of the 
same.”  
Muhammad Afzal (PW-4) deposed during cross-examination that: -  
“It is not in my knowledge that Ejaz deceased 
was beaten thrice due to his nefarious activities, 
by the villagers. It is not in my knowledge that 
Shafat was used to give money to the persons 
and then get profit on the same on monthly 
basis. It is also not in my knowledge that due to 
said reason he had earned scattered enmity in 
and around the vicinity with lots of persons 
over said interest/profit and money. -------- It is 
not in my knowledge that Shafat deceased was 
used to come to police station and getting 
moved applications from different persons 
against other persons by using his former police 
employment and due to said reason he was used 
to blackmail and harass the different persons 
and extract money. It is also not in my 
knowledge that due to said reason he had 
developed lot of annoyance and enmity in and 
around the vicinity and he was even himself 
used to make such frivolous applications against 
different persons.”  
 
 
The above depositions of the prosecution witnesses reveal that 
the witnesses were asked questions about the character of Shafaat and Ijaz, 
deceased. It was safe for them to deny the allegations, but they deliberately 
denied it for want of knowledge. Otherwise, the prosecution witnesses have 
not come with clean hands and bonafide intentions but have made willful 
and malafide concealment of facts as discussed above. Muhammad Arshad 
(PW-1), the complainant, Muhammad Ilyas (PW-2), and Muhammad Afzal 
(PW-4) concealed the facts and very cleverly made vague answers to the 
allegations. Even there is conflict between the statements of the prosecution 

Murder Reference No.185 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.48876-J of 2019 & 
Crl. Appeal No.44259 of 2019 
 
 
 
 
24
witnesses, i.e., Muhammad Arshad (PW-1), the complainant, Muhammad 
Ilyas (PW-2), and Muhammad Afzal (PW-4). The above information reveals 
that the deceased were men of questionable character. Therefore, the 
evidence led by the prosecution in connection with the motive is insufficient 
for relying on the testimonies of the witnesses. The evidence on the motive 
part and suggestions put by the defense regarding the questionable character 
of Shafaat and Ijaz, the deceased, suggested that the above-mentioned 
prosecution witnesses had deliberately concealed the facts. This, again, 
adversely affects the credibility of the prosecution version.   
13. 
 
Moreover, it is noticed that Shahid Husnain S.I. (PW-15)-
Investigating Officer deposed during examination-in-chief that he collected 
seven crime empties of rifle 244 bore and seven crime empties of pistol 30 
bore from the place of occurrence when he inspected the place of 
occurrence. He (PW-15) secured crime empties of rifle 244 bore and pistol 
30 bore vide recovery memo (Ex-PC). The empties recovered from the spot 
were sent to Forensic Science Laboratory Punjab, Lahore, on 04-07-2014 
through Muhammad Hanif 1386/C (since dead). Shahid Husnain S.I. (PW-
15)-Investigating Officer deposed during examination-in-chief that:  
“On 18.07.2014, accused Muhammad Iqbal 
during the course of investigation in presence of 
Muhammad Arif and Zahoor Ellahi made 
disclosure that he can led to recovery of 
rifle.244 bore and pistol.30 bore from the 
residential house of Mukhtar Ahmad son of 
Muhammad Sadiq, caste Gujjar, R/O Udhowal 
Khurd. 
Upon 
this 
disclosure, 
accused 
Muhammad Iqbal was lead to the house of 
Mukhtar Ahmad in presence of witnesses from 
where he produced rifle.244 bore P-9 that was 
un-loaded and three alive rounds P-10/1-3 were 
recovered. Accused Muhammad Iqbal also got 
recovered pistol.30 bore P-11 that was un-

Muhammad Arif (PW-12), the recovery witness, deposed during the 
examination-in-chief that:  
“On 18.07.2014, I alongwith PW Zahoor Ellahi 
went to police station where Iqbal accused 
present before the Court made a disclosure that 
he can lead to the recovery of his rifle.44 bore 
and pistol.30 bore of Moazzam from the house 
of 
accused 
Mukhtar.-------Then 
accused 
Muhammad Iqbal produced pistol.30 bore P-11 
from the same iron box that was un-loaded and 
02 alive bullets P-12/1-2 were recovered from 
the same. Both the rifle.44 bore and pistol 
30.bore alongwith alive rounds and bullets were 
made into two separate sealed parcels and took 
the same into possession vide recovery memo 
Ex.P-P.”  
Shahid Husnain S.I. (PW-15)-the investigating Officer secured rifle 244 bore 
along with three (3) live bullets and pistol 30 bore alongwith two live bullets 
on 18.07.2014 into possession through recovery memo (Ex. PP). The 
scanned copy of the recovery memo (Ex. PP) is as follows: -

On perusal of the recovery memo (Ex. PP), it is found that 
appellant Muhammad Iqbal got recovered the 30-bore pistol and submitted 
that at the time of the incident, said 30-bore pistol was used by his son 
Moazzam (since P.O.). Shahid Husnain S.I. (PW-15), the Investigating 
Officer, deposed that he recovered the rifle 244 caliber from Muhammad 
Iqbal appellant. Shahid Husnain S.I. (PW-15)-the investigating Officer 
prepared the parcel on the spot and seized it through the recovery memo (Ex. 
PP). According to the prosecution version, rifle 244 caliber was got 
recovered by Muhammad Iqbal-appellant, and the same was secured in a 
sealed parcel at the spot by Shahid Husnain S.I. (PW-15)-investigating 
Officer. Afterward, Shahid Husnain S.I. (PW-15)-Investigating Officer, 
handed over the parcels to Maqsood Ahmad ASI (PW-3)-the moharrar, on 
18.07.2014. Maqsood Ahmad ASI (PW-3)-the moharrar handed over parcels 
to Ashiq Ali 3629/C (PW-8) for onward transmission to the Punjab Forensic 
Science Agency, Lahore. The firearms and tool marks examination report 
(Ex. PEE) reveals that 44 caliber rifle was submitted on 25.08.2014 by 
Ashiq Ali 3629/C (PW-8), which matched with seven crime empties 
recovered from the spot. Thus, the positive report of the Firearms and Tool 
Marks Examination Report (Ex. PEE) becomes inconsequential.

From the above-detailed discussion, we are convinced that the 
prosecution has failed to establish its case. The truth was seen buried under 
the debris, and a different story was structured perhaps to lug the appellant 
into trial under the serious offense. It is often said “that Fouler the crime 
higher the decree of proof.” We have gone through the process of keen 
examination of the entire material and found compelling reasons, as stated 
above, to disgrace with the conclusion reached recorded by the learned 
Additional Sessions Judge also found that the prosecution had miserably 
failed to prove the guilt of the accused applicant beyond reasonable doubt. 
Per the dictates of the law, the benefit of every doubt is to be extended in 
favour of the accused. In the case of “Muhammad Akram v. The State” 
(2009 SCMR 230), it is held as under: - 

Murder Reference No.185 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.48876-J of 2019 & 
Crl. Appeal No.44259 of 2019

“The nutshell of the whole discussion is that the 
prosecution case is not free from doubt. It is an 
axiomatic principle of law that in case of doubt, 
the benefit thereof must accrue in favour of the 
accused as matter of right and not of grace. It 
was observed by this Court in the case of Tariq 
Pervez v. The State 1995 SCMR 1345 that for 
giving the benefit of doubt, it was not necessary 
that there should be many circumstances 
creating doubts. If there is circumstance which 
created reasonable doubt in a prudent mind 
about the guilt of the accused, then the accused 
would be entitled to the benefit of doubt not as a 
matter of grace and concession but as a matter 
of right.”. 
15. 
 
We, therefore, accept in toto Criminal Appeal No.48876 of 
2019 filed by Muhammad Iqbal, son of Fatteh Khan, Caste Gujjar, resident 
of Udhuwal, Tehsil & District Gujrat; as a result, whereof conviction and 
sentence recorded by the learned trial court vide judgment dated 17.06.2019 
is set aside and the appellant, namely, Muhammad Iqbal is ordered to be 
acquitted of the charge in case F.I.R. No.506/2014 dated 23.06.2014, under 
Sections 302, 109, 148, 149 P.P.C., at Police Station, Civil Line, District, 
Gujrat and he (the appellant) is directed to be released forthwith if not 
required in any other case.  
16. 
 
Murder Reference No. 185 of 2019, forwarded by the learned 
trial court for confirmation of the death sentence inflicted upon the convict, 
fails, which is answered in NEGNATIVE. 
17. 
 
So far as CRIMINAL APPEAL No.44259 of 2019 seeking the 
conviction of respondents Nos.1 to 7, namely Mukhtar Ahmed, Iftikhar 
Ahmed alias Yar Muhammad, Muhammad Shafi, Altaf Hussain, Ali Raza, 
Ashiq Ali and Yousaf is concerned, for what has been discussed above in the 
light of prosecution, medical, and documentary evidence, the acquittal of 
respondents Nos.1 to 7 do not suffer from any illegality to call for our 
interference with the impugned judgment to their extent. We have also taken 
note of the settled principle of criminal jurisprudence, which states that 
unless it can be shown that the lower court’s judgment is perverse or that it

is entirely illegal, No other conclusion can be drawn except the guilt of the 
accused or misreading or non-reading of evidence resulting in a miscarriage 
of justice. Even otherwise, when a court of competent jurisdiction acquits 
the accused, the double presumption of innocence is attached to their case.  
The acquittal order cannot be interfered with, whereby a charge earns double 
presumption of innocence as held in Muhammad Mansha Kausar v. 
Muhammad Ashgar and others (2003 SCMR 477).  In this case, the 
prosecution has not been able to bring on record adequate incriminating 
evidence against respondents Nos.1 to 7, which connects them with the 
alleged crime. The learned trial Judge has advanced valid and plausible 
reasons for recording acquittal in favor of respondents Nos.1 to 7. The 
judgment of acquittal does not call for any interference. Consequently, we 
find no merit in this Criminal Appeal bearing No.44259 of 2019, which is, 
as a result of this, dismissed as being without prices.
