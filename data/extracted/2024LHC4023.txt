Date of hearing:     11.09.2024. 
Petitioner by: 
M/s. Muhammad Kashif and Malik Shamsul 
Haq, Advocates.  
Respondent by: 
Mr. Nasir Iqbal, Advocate.  
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.- Through 
instant revision petition, petitioner has assailed the vires of judgments 
& decrees dated 03.04.2014 & 18.02.2015, passed by learned Civil 
Judge and Additional District Judge, Jand (Attock), respectively,  
whereby petitioner’s suit for declaration along with permanent and 
mandatory injunction, was concurrently dismissed, however, Trial 
Court’s findings to the extent of decree qua specific performance of 
contract passed in favour of respondent, were set aside by the 
Appellate Court.  
2. 
 
Facts in brief are that petitioner instituted a suit for 
declaration along with permanent and mandatory injunction to the 
effect that he is owner-in-possession of suit property measuring 02-
Kanal 03-Marla, situated in Khasra No.457, Mauza Basal, Tehsil Jand, 
District Attock and respondent has no concern whatsoever with the suit 
property and if respondent has managed / maneuvered any sale deed / 
agreement, same being against the law and facts, is inoperative qua 
rights of petitioner and liable to be set aside. The suit was contested by 
respondent by way of filing written statement. Learned Trial Court, 
after framing issues, recording evidence and hearing arguments of both 
sides, proceeded to dismiss the suit vide judgment & decree dated 
03.04.2014 and at the same time, passed decree for specific 
performance of contract in favour of respondent. Feeling discontent, 

 
2 
C.R. No.404-D of 2015 
 
petitioner filed appeal before learned Additional District Judge, who 
vide judgment & decree dated 18.02.2015 partly accepted the same, set 
aside the findings of Trial Court to the extent of decree qua specific 
performance of contract and upheld Trial Court’s decision qua 
dismissal of petitioner’s suit. Hence, this revision petition.  
3. 
Learned counsel for petitioner submits that document Exh.D1 is 
in fact a loan receipt and not an agreement to sell. He further submits 
that the Courts below have misconstrued the evidence brought on 
record by the respondent in the shape of Exh.D1 & Exh.D2 as the 
agreement between the parties was that of a loan as assurance from the 
petitioner towards the respondent, not for sale, thus, impugned 
judgments & decrees are unsustainable in the eye of law.  
4. 
On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent defends the 
impugned judgments & decrees.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused.  
6. 
 It is the stance of petitioner that due to a friendly relationship 
between the parties, he borrowed Rs.1,00,000/- from the respondent, 
who in exchange thereof, obtained petitioner’s signatures on stamp 
paper for the return of aforesaid amount, however, since petitioner is 
illiterate, he was unable to understand the contents of the stamp paper, 
which was subsequently transformed into a sale agreement. The 
petitioner asserts that this document is false, fabricated and concocted.  
7. 
It is apparent from bare perusal of record that petitioner himself 
admitted to receiving Rs.10,000/- from respondent’s father-in-law, 
namely Haji Abdur Raheem and his signature upon receipt slip 
Exh.D1, which states that on 07.10.2000, he received Rs.10,000/- as 
token money for land. For convenience, the contents of receipt Exh.D1 
are reproduced hereunder:-

Similarly, signature and thumb impression of petitioner are also 
available on the back of stamp paper (Exh.D2), which explicitly states 
that suit property has been sold to respondent for Rs.1,10,000/- vide

C.R. No.404-D of 2015 
 
Iqrarnama / sale deed. During his testimony as PW-1, petitioner 
acknowledged during the course of cross-examination that he 
purchased the stamp paper from Muhammad Ramzan, the Stamp 
Vendor. He also confirmed his signature in the register of Muhammad 
Ramzan. For facility of reference, relevant portion of petitioner’s 
cross-examination is reproduced hereunder:-

8. 
Receiving of payment and affixing signature on disputed stamp 
paper (Exh.D2) are admitted by the petitioner himself. It is also a 
matter of record that according to report of Local Commission 
(Exh.D4), respondent was in possession of the land in question – a fact 
conceded by PW-2 Adeel Akhtar. This evidence provided a basis for 
learned lower Appellate Court to set aside decree of specific 
performance of contract in respondent’s favour, and appellate decision 
is thus based upon correct appreciation of evidence brought on record 
and applicable law.  
9. 
Needless to observe that oral evidence cannot outweigh the 
documentary evidence. The documentary evidence, which was not 
objected to at relevant time, would prevail against oral evidence, 
regardless of how abundant the latter may be. Moreover, it is firmly 
established that oral evidence cannot substitute for documentary 
evidence. The Supreme Court, in Abdul Ghani and others v. Mst. 
Yasmeen Khan and others (2011 SCMR 837), underscored that mere 
oral assertions are insufficient to rebut documentary evidence, which 
holds greater weight and credibility. This principle is further reinforced 
by the ruling in Shamshad v. Arif Ashraf Khan and others (2010 
SCMR 473), where the court lamented that the lower courts failed to 
recognize the precedence of documentary evidence over oral 
testimony. In determining the rights of the parties, it is the quality, nor 
the quantity, of the evidence that should be prioritized. When 

 
4 
C.R. No.404-D of 2015 
 
documentary evidence contradicts the oral testimony, the latter cannot 
be relied upon. It is a well-established rule of appreciation of evidence 
that a person may lie, documents do not. Reliance is placed upon 
Azeem Khan and another v. Mujahid Khan and others (2016 SCMR 
274).  
10. 
Article 103 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 excluded oral 
statement made between the parties to any instrument or their 
representatives. The rationale behind this provision is that inferior 
evidence should be excluded in the presence of superior evidence; that 
a written agreement reflects a deliberate and well considered 
settlement. Furthermore, a party acknowledging a fact in writing is 
immune from mischief, failure and lapse of memory. Once an 
agreement has been reduced in writing, oral evidence is to be 
excluded while proving the terms thereof as against the terms 
specifically reduced in writing. Reference is made to Mst. Baswar 
Sultan v. Mst. Adeeba Alvi (2002 SCMR 326), Bolan Beverages (Pvt.) 
Limited v. PEPSO Co. Inc. and 4 others (PLD 2004 Supreme Court 
860) and Elahi Bakhsh through Legal Heirs and others v. Muhammad 
Iqbal and another (2014 SCMR 1217). 
11. 
Petitioner could not prove his case through cogent and 
confidence inspiring evidence, as rightly observed by the learned 
Courts below. Learned counsel for petitioner could not point out any 
illegality, material irregularity, misreading or non-reading of evidence 
and jurisdictional error in the concurrent decisions of learned Courts 
below qua declaratory decree, warranting any interference by this 
Court in exercise of revisional jurisdiction.  
12. 
Resultantly, this revision petition, being devoid of any merits, is 
hereby dismissed. No order as to costs.
