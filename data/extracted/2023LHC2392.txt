This Court while enforcing the foreign arbitral award dated 
04.04.2017 (the “Final Award”) passed by the London Court of 
International Arbitration (the “LCIA”) will discuss in detail the 
provisions regarding recognition and enforcement of a foreign arbitral 
award in Pakistan under the “Act” and its Schedule, the “NY 
Convention”2 which will then supplement and support the 
jurisprudence developed by the superior court of Pakistan which are 
binding under Article 189 and 201 of the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”). From its inception, 
the “NY Convention Guide” has been conceived to comprehend how 
the “NY Convention” is actually interpreted by national courts. The 
aim of the “NY Guide” is to canvass the richness of the national case 
law on the Convention in an objective manner.  
I. 
Context 
2. 
This is an application (the “Application”) filed under Sections 
3, 5 and 6 of the “Act” on behalf of M/s Tradhol International SA 
Sociedad Unipersonal (the “Tradhol”) for recognition and 
enforcement of the “Final Award” passed by the “LCIA”. In this 
Application, M/s Shakarganj Limited (the “Shakarganj”) has filed 
objections under Section 7 of the “Act” read with Article V of the 
“NY Convention”.  
II. 
The Parties before the Arbitration in LCIA and in this Court 
3. 
(1) The “Tradhol” is involved in the business of ethanol 
trading and distribution having its registered Head Office at 28224 
Puzuelo De Alarcon, Carretera De Humera 43, Madrid, Spain. The 
“Application” is being filed through Muhammad Ali Seena, who is 
the authorized attorney of the “Tradhol International” by means of 
power of attorney dated 21.06.2017. 
(2)  
The “Shakarganj” is a public limited company established 
under the company laws of Pakistan and carrying on its business at 
10th Floor, BOP Tower, 10-B, Block E-III, Main Boulevard, Gulberg-
                                                 
2 The “NY Convention Guide” was initiated in 2010, when UNCITRAL commissioned the assistance of 
Professors Gaillard and Bermann as part of its efforts to promote wider adherence to the text of the “NY 
Convention” as well as its uniform interpretation and effective implementation.

III, Lahore. It is engaged in manufacturing, marketing and export of 
ethanol amongst other products. 
III. 
Execution of Contractual Agreement between the Parties. 
(1) 
On 11.11.2015, a contractual agreement for delivery upto 
30,000 metric tons of different ethanol was executed between 
the “Tradhol” and the “Shakarganj” on a discount of US$ 20 
per metric ton starting from 10.01.2016 (the “Agreement”). It 
was agreed that the “Tradhol” was entitled to recover the 
amount of US$ 600,000 and US$ 12,500 as payment to make 
goodwill. 
(2) 
On 13.11.2015, an email was exchanged between the 
“Tradhol” and the “Shakarganj” regarding singing of the 
“Agreement”.   
 
(3)  
The “Agreement” was governed by English Law and 
contained an arbitration clause whereby the parties agreed to refer all 
disputes under the “Agreement” to arbitration; which reads as 
follows: 
“Any dispute arising out of this contract, shall 
be settled provided that they are not settled in 
an amicable way by TRI AND SHJ by 
arbitration 
at 
the 
London 
Court 
of 
International 
Arbitration 
(“LCIA”) 
in 
accordance with English law. Each party shall 
appoint an arbitrator and the two appointed 
arbitrators shall appoint a third arbitrator, who 
shall act as Chairman of the Tribunal, in 
accordance with the Rules of the LCIA”. 
 
IV. 
Arbitration Proceedings 
 
(1)  
It is to be noted that failure on the part of the “Shakarganj” to 
fulfil express obligations prompted the “Tradhol” to approach the 
“LCIA” on 18.01.2016 with a request for appointment of Mr. Roger 
Rooks as an arbitrator which was accordingly done.  
(2) 
When the “Shakarganj” failed to appoint an arbitrator, the 
“LCIA” appointed Ms. Sarra Kay as arbitrator as a consequence 

 
Civil Original Suit No.80492 of 2017                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   4 
 
whereof the Tribunal was completed on 08.03.2016 through 
appointment of Mr. David Martin Clark as its third member. 
 
(3) 
On 17.03.2016, the “Tradhol” submitted its claim before the 
Tribunal and defence statement of the “Shakarganj” was ordered to 
be sought till 14.04.2016, but the same was not delivered in time.  
 
(4)  
Therefore, 
on 
10.05.2016, 
the 
Tribunal 
ordered 
the 
“Shakarganj” to file statement of defence by not later than 
24.05.2016 and said date was subsequently extended to 20.06.2016 
for compliance of Tribunal’s order.  
 
(5)  
On 26.06.2016, the “Shakarganj” requested the Tribunal for 
extensions of time through email which reads as follows: 
I, Mian Ali Ashfaq LLM (London), am writing 
you in capacity of General Counsel of 
Shakarganj Mills Limited. 
It is with reference to your order dated 29 May 
2016 which have received via courier on 13 
June 2016. The tribunal as per the order has 
allowed till 20th June to deliver our defense 
and counter claims submissions. 
In view of the short time, since receipt of the 
order and keeping in view the large magnitude 
of documents involved, we request you to 
kindly allow till 10th July 2016 for delivery of 
our defense and counter claim submissions as 
well as for the effective compliance of your 
order. 
 
 
(6) 
On 19.07.2016, the “Shakarganj” complied with Tribunal’s 
order dated 14.07.2016 by paying GBP 10,000.00 to the “LCIA” but 
thereafter challenged its jurisdiction by filing a suit in the Civil Court 
Lahore on 25.07.2016 and did not take part in arbitration.  
 
(7) 
On 30.09.2016, the “Shakarganj” informed the Tribunal that 
there was no arbitration agreement and refused to recognize the 
jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

(9) 
On 16.01.2017, the ‘Award on Jurisdiction’ was clarified by 
the Tribunal to the extent of costs, which reads as follows:

VI. 
Tradhol’s 
submission 
before 
this 
Court 
for 
the 
enforcement of “Final Award”. 
 
5. 
Barrister. Iftikhar ud Din Riaz, ASC, argues that the 
“Tradhol” has filed this “Application” by complying with 
requirements stipulated in Section 5 of the “Act” read with Article 
IV of the “NY Convention” and has sought recognition and 
enforcement of the “Final Award” from this Court under Section 6 
of the “Act” as this section empowers this Court to recognise and 
enforce the award in the same manner as a judgment or order of a 
court in Pakistan. He further stated that the “Final Award” passed by 
the “LCIA” is final in all aspects as it has been passed on merits after 
having examined all the documents and record produced before it. 
Barrister Iftikhar ud Din Riaz, ASC while referring to Section 7 of 
the “Act” read with Article V of the “NY Convention” stated that 
none of the impediments against the enforceability of the “Final 
Award” are attracted in this case. 
VII. 
Shakarganj’s Objections before this Court. 
6. 
Ms. Deeba Tasneem Anwar, Advocate for the “Shakarganj”, 
objected to the maintainability of the “Application” on the grounds 
that the “Agreement” has neither been executed by the competent 
person nor the “Shakarganj” has authorized any person to sign the 
same. He also stated that the “Shakarganj” challenged the 
“Agreement” before the Civil Court in Pakistan and interim relief, in 
this respect, was also granted to it that too was communicated to the 
Tribunal and “Tradhol” but, in utter disregard, the Tribunal continued 
with arbitration proceedings during the continuance of relief granted 
and passed the “Final Award”. It has further been objected that the 
“Shakarganj” was neither party to the “Agreement” nor the “Final 
Award”. Thus the “Final Award” is not in accordance with the laws 

 
Civil Original Suit No.80492 of 2017                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   9 
 
of Pakistan and therefore is unenforceable under Article V 1(a) as 
well as Article V 2(b) of the NY Convention read with Section 7 of 
the “Act”.  
VIII. Moot Points for Determination 
7. 
It is to be noted that the entire case of the Respondent revolves 
around two objections. Firstly, the “Shakarganj” has claimed that the 
“Final Award” is unenforceable as the “Shakarganj” has neither 
executed the “Agreement” nor it has authorized any person to sign the 
same. Thus the “Shakarganj” is availing the benefit of Article V 1(a) 
of the “NY Convention” while emphasizing that the “Agreement” was 
‘not valid’ or ‘invalid’. Secondly, the “Shakarganj” has claimed that 
the “Final Award” is unenforceable as the “Shakarganj” had already 
challenged the “Agreement” before the Civil Courts in Pakistan, 
which had granted an interim relief, and the Tribunal ought to have 
awaited the final determination of the issues before the Civil Court but 
continued with arbitration proceedings and passed the “Final Award”. 
Thus, the “Shakarganj” is availing the benefits of Article V 2(b) of 
the “NY Convention” while emphasizing that the enforcement of the 
”Final Award” would be contrary to the “public policy” of Pakistan. 
8. 
In view of the submissions of the “Tradhol” and the 
objections filed by the “Shakarganj”, the following moot points are 
necessary for determination of this Court: 
1. 
Whether this High Court has jurisdiction to 
enforce a foreign arbitral award? 
 
2. 
Whether the “Applicant” has furnished 
documents in accordance with requirements of 
Section 5 of the Act? 
 
3. 
Whether the “Final Award” is unenforceable 
under Article V 1(a) of the NY Convention read with 
Section 7 of the “Act” because the “Agreement” was 
invalid? 
 
4. 
Whether the “Final Award” is unenforceable 
under Article V 2(b) of the NY Convention read with 
Section 7 of the “Act” because its enforcement 
would be contrary to public policy of Pakistan? 
 

 
Civil Original Suit No.80492 of 2017                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   10 
 
5. 
Whether the doctrine of pro-enforcement bias 
is applicable in the Courts in Pakistan? 
 
Moot Point No.1 (Jurisdiction of High Court for enforcement of award) 
 
9. 
At the outset, when confronted to counsel for the “Shakarganj” 
about participation in proceedings before the “LCIA” coupled with 
compliance of Tribunal’s order dated 14.07.2016 and filing of civil 
suit before Civil Court, Lahore and not before this Court, Ms. Deeba 
Tasneem Anwar, Advocate admitted that the “Shakarganj” filed civil 
suit before the Civil Court, Lahore after appearing before the 
“LCIA”. Barrister Iftikhar ur Din Riaz, ASC argued that the civil 
court has no jurisdiction for the enforcement of the “Agreement” for 
the reason that the High Court has exclusive jurisdiction to deal with 
such matter during pre-arbitration, pro-arbitration and post 
arbitration. Before discussing this issue at length, it is to be noted that 
Section 3 of the Act deals with jurisdiction of the Court and is 
reproduced hereinbelow: 
 
3. 
Jurisdiction of the 
Court.--- 
(1) 
Notwithstanding anything contained in any 
other law for the time being in force, the 
Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to 
adjudicate and settle matters related to or 
arising out from this Act. 
 
(2)  
An 
application 
to 
stay 
legal 
proceedings pursuant to the provisions of 
Article II of the Convention may be filed in the 
Court, in which the legal proceedings are 
pending. 
 
(3) 
In the exercise of is jurisdiction, the 
Court shall---   
 
(a)  
follow the procedure as nearly as 
may be provided for the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908 (Act V of 1908); and  
 
(b) 
have all the powers vested in a 
civil court under the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908 (Act V of 1908). 
 

 
Civil Original Suit No.80492 of 2017                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   11 
 
  
The “Act” has defined the “Court” in Section 2(d) as follows: 
(d) “Court” means a High Court and such other 
superior court in Pakistan as may be notified by 
the Federal Government in the official Gazette; 
and  
 
10. 
Accordingly, it follows from the above sections that the “High 
Courts” have exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate and settle the 
matters relating to or arising out from the “Act”. The notified Courts 
in Pakistan, in order to protect the sanctity of foreign arbitral awards 
as defined under Section 2(d) of the “Act” are the High Court and 
such other superior Courts as may be notified by the Federal 
Government. If the parties have any issue with the foreign 
agreements or the awards, they can only refer the matter to the Court 
as defined under Section 2(d) of the “Act” and not any other Court 
which is not notified. To protect the confidence of investors, the 
Courts (the High Court under Section 2(d) of the “Act”) can then, if 
need be, deal the matter of pre-arbitration, pro arbitration and post 
arbitration. If we examine the jurisdiction of this Court as defined 
under Section 3 of the “Act” which states that the Court shall 
exercise exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate and settle matter relating 
to or arising out from this “Act”, the Court has to enforce (i) foreign 
arbitral award and (ii) foreign agreements; although foreign 
agreements are not defined under the “Act” but the agreements are 
defined under Article II of the “NY Convention” therefore, any issue 
with regard to enforcement of foreign arbitral award or foreign 
agreement, as defined under the “Act” and the Article II, is arisen, 
then this can further be examined under Section 3(2) of the “Act” 
where again in proceeding regarding the stay application may be 
filed in the Court. The word “Court” is defined in capital which 
means the High Court and has been referred in various sections of the 
“Act” which again means the High Court but under Section 4, the 
word “court” is not in capital but it still means it is in capital and 
would be the High Court notified by the Federal Government. 
Section 3 of the “Act” gives exclusive jurisdiction to this Court in 

 
Civil Original Suit No.80492 of 2017                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   12 
 
terms of Section 2(d) of the “Act” and the section ibid starts with 
‘notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time 
being in force’ the Court shall exercise exclusive jurisdiction to 
adjudicate and settle matters related to or arising from the “Act”. If 
Section 3 of the “Act” be read with Section 4 of the “Act” it makes it 
clear that jurisdiction is only confined to the High Court because 
Section 4(1) of the “Act” do mentions the word “court” and it is 
intertwined with Section 3 of the “Act” under the doctrine of 
intertwined as developed by this Court in the case of “TARIQ IQBAL 
MALIK Versus M/s MLTIPLIERZ GROUP PVT. LTD. and 04 
others” (2022 CLD 468) by holding that “It may even be said that 
both Sections 256 and 257 of the Act are in pari materia and thus 
must be construed together. The ultimate outcome of the said 
provisions being intertwined with one another leads to the conclusion 
that in order to invoke Section 257 of the Act, it is mandated that any 
complainant must have some form of link or nexus to the affairs of a 
Company. Section 256 of the Act categorically clarifies that the link 
or nexus required to have the affairs of any company investigated is 
the holding of membership in such company in the manner as is 
categorically mentioned in Section 256 of the Act”.  
11. 
Further 
in the 
case 
of 
“Malik 
MEHBOOB 
Versus 
COMMISSIONER, RAWALPINDI and others” (PLD 2023 Lahore 
97), the Court held that “that sections 5, 15 and 19 are closely tied 
with each other and are intertwined and the same cannot be 
separately applied in the case of the Petitioner. As learned counsel 
for the Petitioner stated that while passing the impugned order the 
Respondent has not considered the provision of section 15(2) of 
the Act, which according to doctrine of intertwined cannot be 
applied separately and without fulfilling the requirement of section 
15(1) ibid. In the recent judgment of this Court passed at 
Rawalpindi Bench, reported as "Tariq Iqbal Malik v. Messrs 
Multiplierz Group Pvt. Ltd. and 4 others" (2022 CLD 468) has 
also developed the doctrine of intertwined.  

 
Civil Original Suit No.80492 of 2017

12.  
Accordingly, the High Court has jurisdiction to entertain the 
instant matter. It is to be noted that the “Shakarganj” during the 
pendency of arbitration proceeding approached the Civil Court, 
Lahore by filing civil suit and the said suit was dismissed with the 
observation that it has no jurisdiction to entertain it. As discussed 
above, the word “C”, the Court means the High Court only under the 
“Act” to entertain such petition for enforcement of arbitral awards 
not the Civil Court.   
Moot Point No.2 (Furnishing of documents) 
13. 
When confronted to counsel for the “Shakarganj” whether it 
has filed any document as per Section 5 of the “Act”, she stated that 
the “Shakarganj” has only filed reply but no document has been filed. 
Section 5 of the “Act” deals with furnishing of documents by the 
party applying for recognition and enforcement of the award and is 
reproduced as follows: 
5. 
Furnishing of documents.--- (1) The 
party 
applying 
for 
recognition 
and 
enforcement of foreign arbitral award under 
this Act shall, at the time of application, 
furnish 
documents 
to 
the 
Court 
in 
accordance 
with 
Article 
IV 
of 
the 
Convention. 
 
  
Article IV of the “NY Convention” is also reproduced 
hereinbelow for clarity: 
Article IV 
 
1. To obtain the recognition and enforcement 
mentioned in the preceding article, the party 
applying for recognition and enforcement 
shall, at the time of the application, supply:- 
 
(a) The duly authenticated original award or 
a duly certified copy thereof;  
(b) The original agreement referred to in 
article II or a duly certified copy thereof. 
 
2. If the said award or agreement is not made 
in an official language of the country in 
which the award is relied upon, the party 
applying for recognition and enforcement of 
the award shall produce a translation of 

 
Civil Original Suit No.80492 of 2017                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   14 
 
these documents into such language. The 
translation shall be certified by an official or 
sworn translator or by a diplomatic or 
consular agent. 
 
14. 
Barrister Iftikhar ud Din Riaz, ASC for the “Tradhol” has 
filed the affidavit of “Henry Norris Adams”, Notary whereby 
certified copies of documents have been referred and same has been 
done Apostille and also find mention in the “Final Award”. The 
Court has to only examine the documents filed before in order to 
enforce such award under the doctrine of pro-enforcement bias.  
15. 
As per the “Tradhol”, it has complied with requirements of 
Section 5 of the “Act” read with Article IV of the “ NY Convention” 
by producing certified copy of LCIA’s Award on Jurisdiction of 30th 
November, 2016 (Pages 52 to 62 of the “Application”), certified of 
Memorandum of Clarification to the LCIA’s Award on Jurisdiction 
dated 16th January, 2017 (Pages 63 to 66 of the “Application”) and 
certified copy of LCIA’s Second Final Arbitration Award dated 04th 
April, 2017 (Pages 67 to 91 of the “Application”). Certification of 
aforementioned documents is mentioned in Affidavit of the Tradhhol 
English Solicitor (Pages 11 to 16 of the “Application”). Since the 
“Final Award” has been rendered by the Tribunal on the basis of the 
“Agreement” and considering the defence with regard to its validity 
therefore, it would be a reasonable basis for the Court to proceed with 
the “Application” under the “Act” read with the “NY Convention”. 
Moot Point No.3. (Invalidity of Agreement) 
16. 
The foremost objection raised by the “Shakarganj” is 
regarding the execution of the “Agreement” coupled with 
incompetency of its executor/representative and signing thereof so as 
to form objections to be performed by the “Shakarganj” on the 
touchstone of Article V 1(a) of the “NY Convention” read with 
Section 7 of the “Act”.  
17. 
Before going further and discussing the facts of the instant 
matter in detail, it is essential to reproduce Section 7 of the “Act” 
and Article V 1(a) of the “NY Convention” quoted by the learned 
counsel of the “Shakarganj”: 

 
Civil Original Suit No.80492 of 2017                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   15 
 
 
Section 7 of the Act: 
 
7.  
Unenforceable foreign arbitral awards.--- 
The recognition and enforcement of a foreign 
arbitral award shall not be refused except in 
accordance with Article V of the [NY] 
Convention. 
 
 
Article V 1(a) of the NY Convention: 
 
1. Recognition and enforcement of the award 
may be refused, at the request of the party 
against whom it is invoked, only if that party 
furnishes to the competent authority where the 
recognition and enforcement is sought, proof 
that:- 
 
(a) The parties to the agreement referred to in 
article II were, under the law applicable to them, 
under some incapacity, or the said agreement is 
not valid under the law to which the parties have 
subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, 
under the law of the country where the award 
was made; or  
… … … 
 
Bare perusal of Section 7 of the “Act” read with Article V 1(a) 
of the “NY Convention” reveals that the recognition and enforcement 
of a foreign arbitral award may be refused in Pakistan if the party 
(Shakarganj) furnishes proof to the competent authority of Pakistan 
(this Court) that the parties to the agreement were under some 
“incapacity”, or the said agreement is “not valid” under the law to 
which the parties have subjected it (or failing any indication thereon, 
under the law of the country where the award was made). 
18. 
The objection of the “Shakarganj” as embodied in Article 
V(1)(a) with regard to lack of capacity of the parties is not the issue 
in hand however, only concern of the “Shakarganj” is with regard to 
invalidity of the “Agreement” because the “Shakarganj” has neither 
executed the “Agreement”, nor it has authorized any person to sign 
the same. Accordingly, under the above Article, onus is on the 
“Shakarganj” to prove the invalidity of the “Agreement” and the 

 
Civil Original Suit No.80492 of 2017                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   16 
 
“Tradhol” has only to prove prima facie existence of the 
“Agreement”.  
19.  
Therefore, it is essential to note that the “Agreement” was 
executed between the “Tradhol” and the “Shakarganj” on certain 
terms and conditions which includes an arbitration clause, governing 
law and applicable rules. The basis of settlement was elucidated in 
“Agreement” and the same was also mentioned in the “Final 
Award” which reads as follows: 
 
(a) 
Shakarganj agreed to pay Tradhol a total of 
USD612,500.00: 
(i) 
Of this sum, Shakarganj was permitted 
to pay USD600,000.00 by way of a 
discount to the prices negotiated for the 
sale of cargoes of ethanol of USD20.00 
per 
metric 
tonne 
(“mt”). 
This 
arrangement was subject to compliance 
with the terms of the Agreement, failing 
which any unpaid discount became 
immediately payable on demand. 
(ii) 
Payment of balance of USD12,500.00 
was deferred until the end of the first 
quarter of 2016. 
(b) 
Shakarganj 
accordingly 
agreed 
to 
supply 
Tradhol with 30,000 mt of Product and to give 
Tradhol the right of first refusal over all ethanol 
they produced until Tradhol had lifted this 
quality 
(and 
thus 
the 
total 
discount 
of 
USD600,000.00 had been paid). 
(c) 
Shakarganj expressly agreed to keep Tradhol 
informed of their daily production and stock 
position. 
(d) 
All previous disputes between the parties were 
deemed settled. 
 
20.   As the heart of controversy revolves around the execution of 
the “Agreement” and its invalidity by the “Shakarganj”, therefore, it 
is imperative to look at the definition of the term “agreement” used in 
Article V 1(a) of the “NY Convention”. Article II of the “NY 
Convention” itself defines the term “agreement in writing” as 
follows: 
Article II 
 
1. … … … 
2. The term " agreement in writing" shall 
include an arbitral clause in a contract or an 
arbitration agreement, signed by the parties 

 
Civil Original Suit No.80492 of 2017                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   17 
 
or contained in an exchange of letters or 
telegrams. 
 
  
Clause 2 of Article II gives an inkling of the scope of the term 
“agreement in writing”, which has been defined to include an arbitral 
clause in a contract or arbitration agreement, “signed by the parties 
or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams”. Accordingly, 
such an agreement can be signed by the parties or be contained in an 
exchange of letters or telegrams. 
21. 
Accordingly, 
it 
is 
crucial 
to 
reproduce 
chains 
of 
communications exchanged between the parties mentioned in the 
“Final Award”. 
 
(a) 
By an email timed as 21.13hrs on 20 November 2015 
Tradhol wrote to Shakarganj as follows: 
 
"We would like to load as much ethanol as 
possible and as early as possible, so per 
Agreement clause 1 we wait to hear from you on 
yr ethanol availability no later than next Monday 
November 23rd." 
 
(b) 
On 23 November at 13:27hrs Shakarganj stated by email 
that they planned to start their distilleries "in the second 
half of December". As regards the prospect of delivering 
some product in December 2015, Shakarganj said: 
"that it will not be possible for technical reasons 
as we will be restarting our distillery after a 
prolonged shutdown. By committing to any 
quantities before successful restart of plant 
operations, I will be risking delay in shipment 
timings" 
 
Shakarganj also asked Tradhol to "let me know an 
indicative price offer for end January shipment so I may 
start my molasses procurement". 
 
(c) 
Tradhol gave indicative prices at 18.19hrs on the same 
day and reiterated their call for Shakarganj to provide 
details of the quantities being made available in 
accordance with their obligations under clause 1(f) of the 
Agreement, to which Shakarganj replied at 19:48hrs as 
follows; 
 
"This is in order to comply with "Price and 
quantity (with its qualities spilt) for the first lot 
shall be proposed not later than November 23 
2015" Please appreciate that other distilleries 
have sufficient stocks of molasses to carry them 
through November and December while we have 
to wait for fresh molases and restart our 
operations after a prolonged shutdown. As such 

 
Civil Original Suit No.80492 of 2017                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   18 
 
our situation is not fully comparable to that of 
other distilleries... 
 
I can offer maximum 2,000MT REN at 80MT per 
day starting 15 December as first lot and if there 
is any change in production capacity I will inform 
you well in advance. Once our distilleries are fully 
operational, 
we 
will 
be 
able 
to 
offer 
larger quantiles." 
 
  
 
Shakarganj made no comment on the availability of ENA. 
 
(d) 
Tradhol immediately queried the position with regard to 
the ENA and Inform Shakarganj) by email on 24 
November at 09.21hrs that per clause a) we notify you we 
want to ship at much EX at possible and as soon as 
possible, so pls use your molasses availability to produce 
said grade and not Ren”. 
 
Tradhol further reiterated in that email that, "until 30,000 
MT delivered", they were interested in "all ethanol you 
can produce with your available molasses, so you are not 
entitled to sell to others”… that is, including any REN 
which Shakarganj was able to produce over and above the 
ENA which Tradhol prioritized. In the same email, 
Tradhol said: 
“…I am curious why you capped ren availability to 2,000 
MT”. 
 
(e)  
At 13.04hrs that day Shakarganj stated: 
 
Please note our ENA capacity is 2,500MT per month but 
it will only come online in January as we are performing 
maintenance/modification to avoid same quality issues 
that were identified in the previous reason.  
 
Please be assured I have NO OTHER ENA commitments 
to anyone in the market to any ENA that I ship will be for 
you only, I have noted your request to produce as much 
ENA as possible and I will allocate my molasses 
accordingly. However, please do note I have some REN 
commitments to other buyers that were male prior to our 
agreement. Still, before making any new REN sales also, I 
will give you first right of refusal and share with you the 
best price offered to me as well. I will only make ethanol 
sales for a given month to other buyers only after you 
have declined to lift the volume. 
 
Regarding your curiosity about 2,000MT. it was my 
understanding we were make first shipment on 10 January 
so I estimated 2,000 MT from 13 December to 10 January 
If it is later, then obviously the quantity will be higher”. 
 
(f) 
At 15.06hrs on 24 November 2015 Shakarganj wrote 
again, as follows:  
 
"For first parcel I indicated firm date of 10 
January upon your insistence for 2,000AFT. 

 
Civil Original Suit No.80492 of 2017                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   19 
 
For ENA I Informed you that we have 
maintenance work on the plant which is expected 
to be completed in December. For 12 months of 
2016 if you want my entire capacity of 80MT ENA 
per day you can have it. I have no other ENA 
commitments. Obviously we need appropriate 
pricing for this. 
 
I have REN commitments from last year that will 
not affect your cargoes. I can offer approx 
2.300MT per month ENA and 2,300MT per month 
REN when all plants start running smoothly after 
long shutdown. 
  
If it is technically possible to start ENA obviously I 
will... 
 
(g)  
Tradhol responded at 15.36hrs on 24 November 2015 
reiterating that it wished Shakarganj to start producing 
ENA by 15 December 2015 at the latest, even if this meant 
delaying the start of REN production and asking if they 
could count on 2,500 MT ren per month, pro-rata from 15 
December, allowing Shakarganj to "use balance to your 
other commitments" (that is, after Shakarganj had fulfilled 
their 2,500 MT commitment to Tradhol). 
 
(h) 
At 10:30hrs on 25 November 2015, Shakarganj replied 
saying: 
 
"For purposes of clarity, I can allocate you 
2,500MT per month REN capacity and 2,500 MT 
per month ENA capacity in good faith. Indicative 
start up date for REN is 15 December and for ENA 
plant is sometime in January. In case I commit any 
ENA quantity to you, it will not be in good faith 
and will create bad taste later... Also, as good 
faith, if you procure some 1,000-2,000T ENA from 
other suppliers, I can accommodate your expected 
discount in REN deal," 
 
Shakarganj went on in that email to state that: 
 
"I cannot continue to be pressured into making 
commitments that can embarrass me later, as such 
I can only commit a cargo once I am confident the 
plant is ready for production. As already 
promised, no cargo will be sold to anyone else 
before being offered to you so please do not worry 
that I will produce ENA and give to someone 
else... 
Also once our plants come online, Mr. Akhtar 
Habib will convey on daily basis production and 
stock figures". 
 
(i)  
After further email exchanges on 25 November 2015, 
Tradhol wrote to Sharkarganj at 13.00hrs on 26 
November saying: 
 

 
Civil Original Suit No.80492 of 2017                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   20 
 
"Please revert to below so we can have a clear 
picture that min. 80 MT day of ren+80 MT day for 
ENA will be committed to us from the day you 
start production in each plant, and that of course 
no deliveries to others can be mode If said 
minimum vols not available for TRI." 
 
(j)  
In reply, on 26 November 2015, Sharkarganj said: 
 
I have indicated our capacity of 80MT per day of 
REN and 80MT per day of ENA that will be 
allocated to Tradhol. However the actual 
production con vary and as such, any shipment 
dates we agree on will take into account margin 
for reduced production and also margin for transit 
time. Also, as part of repairing our relationship, I 
request that parcel negotiations should be as per 
market practice i.e. you indicate to me an 
estimated shipment period and a price indication. 
It is not productive to have never-ending 
discussions 
over 
startup 
dates 
and 
daily 
production capacities. It should be sufficient for 
you the capacities I have indicated above and the 
commitment that no sales will be made to any 
party without offering you first right of refusal. 
Also if for any reason you feel my price is too high 
or shipment period is not suitable, you can 
purchase from the market price and debit USD20 
to me in spirit of our earlier agreement As 
committed earlier, I have no issue regarding 
booking my entire 2016 ENA production with 
Tradhol as I have currently no ENA commitments 
with anyone”. 
 
(k) Later that afternoon, Tradhol replied saying: 
 
“… …. 
2. Agree production can vary for reasons out of yr 
control, but pls confirm that if same happens no 
shipments will be done to others if this 80+80 for 
TRI not meet. 
3. Prices lets try to agree them, if not agreed there 
is already a provision in the contract on how to 
proceed, I just wanted to note the situation we are 
facing due to the inability to hedge as no clear vol 
nor load dates. 
Hope we can buy all yr ENA and ren production, 
both the 30k as per settlement and whatever on top 
you will produce." 
 
(l)  
Sharkarganj replied at 08.19hrs on 3 December 2015 
saying: 
 
"I intend to fulfill all my commitments that were 
made to other buyers before we reached our 
contractual agreement of 11 November 2015. 
After fulfilling these commitments, I have a net 
production capacity of approx 80 MT per day of 
ENA and approx 80MT per day of REN. 

 
Civil Original Suit No.80492 of 2017                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   21 
 
I am confident I will be able to utilise these 
capacities [sic] as agreed, and will promise you 
cargo loads based on my idea of capacity 
utilisation. I am only waiting for production to 
come on line without difficulties so I can review 
these quantities to you and so that we may revise 
them if needed. It is our intention to fulfill our 
commitments without further disappointments and 
hope for the same.  
However we would suggest that as Buyer you 
make offers for our cargo based on our indicated 
production capacities, and your expected sales 
demand with a rice, volume and shipment period. 
We will negotiate this as before and reach 
conclusion In case the price cannot be agreed the 
contract provides for a price settlement formula. 
Our agreement covers discount and volume and it 
should be maintained that way. It is not efficient 
for you to attempt to manage our production 
capabilities just as it would not be efficient for us 
to manage your sales. Please let us have your 
demand for shipment during the end Jan period”. 
 
(m) 
Tradhol responded at 10.37hrs on 3 December 2015, 
saying:  
 
"You requested us to "start looking for customers 
AFTER plant start up because in case there are 
any delays in plant start up we do not wish to face 
another problem" and indeed we still do not have 
a clear picture of volume available and load dates 
despite it should have been informed by you on 
November 23rd, moreover after reading that you 
"intend to fulfill all my commitments that were 
made to other buyers before we reached our 
contractual agreement of 11 November 2015. After 
fulfilling these commitments, I have a net 
production capacity of approx 80 MT per day of 
ENA and approx. 80MT per day of REN" which we 
disagree in full and without prejudice we want to 
reserve our rights. 
So in summary and to go to the point... pls Inform 
to us clearly of ren and ENA availability by for 
example January 31" as we insist on our request 
that we intend to deliver all ethanol available, 
once we have your volume availability we will try 
to agree price with you, and if not agreement, 
price clause will apply”. 
 
(n) 
At 12.40hrs on 4 December, Tradhol stated that they 
were: 
 
"waiting for you to confirm our request for 
January 31st, being volume minimum 2,400 MT 
ENA and 3,600 MT ren". 
 
(o) 
Shakarganj responded at 08.05hrs on 7 December when 
they declined to confirm the quantities which could be 
supplied, saying: 

 
Civil Original Suit No.80492 of 2017                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   22 
 
 
"I can only make promise for firm quantity after 
plant startup te. 15 December for REN and 1 
January for ENA. 
Also please note maximum possible in one 
shipment is 2,400 REN and 2,400 ENA due to 
shore tank limitation". 
 
(p) 
This produced a reply from Tradhol at 2.42pm on 7 
December, in which it said: 
 
"pls note you are already into settlement 
agreement breach as quantities available should 
have been informed by you not later than 
November 23rd. for what we reserve our rights. 
I wonder also how can you ask us to "make offers 
for our cargo based on our indicated production 
capacities" when, at same time, you request 
"start look for customers AFTER plant start up 
because in case there are any delays in plant start 
up we do not wish to face another problem”, you 
intimate you will deliver to others before Tradhak, 
what we do not accept and also reserve our rights, 
and recently you double confirm you “(…) can 
only make promise for firm quantity after plant 
startup le. 15 December for REN and 1 January 
for ENA”. Thus we are not having a clear picture 
at all on quantity availability and additionally 
Shakarganj, also in breach of the settlement 
agreement, is not having the capacity to deliver 
our quantities requested… how can we make any 
sales on the ground that such an attempt would in 
the circumstances have been impractical and 
commercially unreasonable: being so we also 
reserve our rights to claim any damages this may 
cause. Anyway, saved we are not waiving our right 
to claim damages, pls clarify if 
1. You will inform ren availability by December 
15th or alternatively when ren plant starts 
production and ENA availability by January 1st or 
alternatively when ENA plant starts production or  
2. If you will inform ren and ENA availability by 
the time both Ren and ENA plant start production, 
this is, about January 1". 
 
(q) In reply at 14.50hrs that day, 7 December 2015, Sharkarganj 
said:  
 
"I will inform availability by December 15 or alternatively 
when ren plant starts production and ENA availability by 
January 1" or alternatively when ENA plant starts 
production  
Please stop making references to damages etc. Also in 
case you face difficulties in making sales after I have 
advised of product availability. I can offer assistance as 
we are receiving many offers but we are declining all of 
them due to our commitments with you.

(r)  
Tradhol replied immediately saying that they were 
interested in all Sharkarganj's production. They again 
urged Sharkarganj to start ENA production before REN 
because, as Tradhol had made clear in earlier messages, 
they had an urgent need for that product. 
 
(s)  
By email at 19.41hrs on 16 December 2015, Shakarganj 
confirmed that they had started production at their REN 
plant (not their ENA plant as Tradhol had requested) and 
that REN would be produced "after 3 days i.e. 18 
December". Shakarganj also confirmed in that email that 
ENA production was to start on 1 January 2016 with the 
first product expected from 4 January 2016. They 
concluded 
"There too, [as regards ENA production] if we do 
not face any quality concerns. we can offer up to 
2.400MT ENA in end January and then 2:400MT 
again at the end of each subsequent month” 
 
(t)  
Tradhol responded to this message at 21.04hrs on 16 
December 2015, saying in relevant part: 
 
"Now that picture it is more clear lets perform the 
settlement agreement, also pls sticking to its procedure, 
namely to follow chronologically points 1.a.), 1.c) and 
1.e) so going to action and ref point 1.a) pls inform when 
2.000 AT ENA will be available as we want to load them 
at the earliest." 
 
The next day, 17 December 2015, Tradhol sent a chaser 
to Sharkarganj at 20.37hrs saying in relevant part: 
 
"As per clause 1.a) we require 2,000 AT ENA to be loaded 
asap, pls inform when same available, once date 
confirmed we will move to points 1.c) and 1.e)…” 
 
(u) 
Having received no response, Tradhol wrote again to 
Shakarganj the following day, 18 December at 14:33hrs, 
in the following terms: 
 
"Pls revert to our firm ethanol request.., that we 
would like to deliver not later than 30 days from 
now, I remind you that you should have proposed 
us price and quantity (with its quality split) for the 
first lots on or before November 23rd, but we have 
nothing firm from you yet...  
Hope you understand we cannot wait forever as 
we need to move on the settlement performance 
and execution, what we cannot if you do not 
inform and confirm ACCURATE delivery dates for 
us to sell the ethanol, look for a vessel and 
afterwards, fix price with you or alternatively stick 
to monthly average price" 
 
(v) 
Shakarganj replied by email at 17:00hrs on 18 December 
2015 stating 
 
"Noted your firm request that loading is to be no 
later than 17 January 2016. Also noted your

22. 
The above communications were exchanged between the 
parties and were sent through an automated information system 
which squarely comes within the meaning of terms defined in the 
Electronic Transactions Ordinance, 2002, as well as within the 
meaning of “agreement in writing” defined in Article II Clause 2 of 
the “NY Convention”.   
23. 
This position has further been supported by this Court in the 
case of “LOUIS DREYFUS COMMODITIES SUISSE S.A. Versus 
ACRO TEXTILE MILLS LTD” (PLD 2018 Lahore 597) as follows: 
 
23.       Therefore, the supply of the original arbitration agreement was 
held to concern the admissibility of enforcement proceedings which 
really seems to echo the enumerations of Article IV of the Convention 
and one cannot doubt the requirement to be essential to set in motion the 
proceedings for enforcement. However, Acro on the contrary, invites this 
Court to blur the line between the Article IV requirement and Article V 
defence of validity of agreement. The term "agreement in writing" has to 
be seen in the context of Article II and which specifies that the arbitral 
clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement may be either signed by 
the parties or alternately may be teased out of an exchange of letters or 
telegrams. By the passage of time and with the onset of far more innovate 
technology, emails and other forms of modern information systems can 
justifiably be included in the term "exchange of letters or telegrams" so 
as to enlarge and broaden the scope and to give effect to the Convention 
in present times. Otherwise the Convention will be rendered unworkable 
and pedantic and thus unsuitable for changing times. In essence, 
therefore, the claimant has merely to supply a copy of the agreement, 
whether signed or unsigned, or based on "exchange of letters or 
telegrams" and that is sufficient compliance of Article IV. All other 
questions are in the realm of validity or otherwise of the agreement, 
including the question of its proper execution as raised by Acro herein, 
and thus to be dealt with as a defence under Article V. In Smita 
Conductors Ltd. v Euro Alloys Ltd., Appeal (civil) 12930 of 1996, the 
Indian Supreme Court held that: 
 
"What needs to be understood in this context is that the agreement to 
submit to arbitration must be in writing. What is an agreement in writing 
is explained by para 2 of Article II. If we break down para 2 into 
elementary parts, it consists of four aspects. It includes an arbitral clause 
(1) in a contract containing an arbitration clause signed by the parties, 
(2) an arbitration agreement signed by the parties, (3) an arbitral clause 
in a contract contained in exchange of letters or telegrams, and (4) an 
arbitral agreement contained in exchange of letters or telegrams. If an 
arbitration clause falls in any one of these four categories, it must be 
treated as an agreement in writing." 
 
"If the two contracts stood affirmed by reason of their conduct as 
indicated in the letters exchanged, it must be held that there is an 
agreement in writing between the parties in this regard." (emphasis 
added)

24. 
Although it was urged by the “Shakarganj” that the 
signatories of the “Agreement” were not authorized yet exchanging 
of emails, as mentioned above, have not been disputed therefore, the 
existence of the “Agreement” stands established as per provision of 
the “Act” and the NY Convention.  
25. 
So far as objection of the “Shakarganj” with regard to the 
signatories/representative is concerned, the Tribunal in the “Final 
Award” noted that the persons who executed the “Agreement” had 
ostensible authority to enter into the same and observed that: 
 
“26. 
On 30 November 2016, the Tribunal issued its Award on 
Jurisdiction, holding that it had jurisdiction to determine its own 
jurisdiction and to determine the substantive dispute between the 
parties. The Tribunal's was satisfied that the two individuals who 
executed the Agreement on behalf of Shakarganj certainly had 
ostensible, if not actual, authority to enter into the Agreement. At 
paragraphs 42 and 43 of the Award, the Tribunal said: 
 
42. We also took note that Respondents [Sharkarganj] 
took certain steps in the arbitration, and by doing so, 
acted in a way that was inconsistent with challenging 
our jurisdiction to determine the substantive dispute 
between the Parties. On two separate occasions (20 
June 2016 and 14 July 2016), Respondents applied to 
the Tribunal for an extension of time by which to serve 
their Defence submissions. And then, on 19 July 2016, 
the Respondents paid their share of the deposit of 
£10,000 that had been requested by the LCLA to cover 
estimated coats of the Tribunal in the context of this 
reference. It was not until 27 July 2016, that 
Respondents first gave notice to Claimants, the Court of 
the LCIA and the Tribunal that they were challenging 
our right to determine the substantive claims in London 
under the Rules of the LCIA. It seemed to us that 
Respondents had submitted to the jurisdiction by taking 
these steps in the action. 
 
43. In summary, we have found that we have the right to 
determine our own jurisdiction by reason of Statute, case 
law and the LCLA Rules and that Respondents had failed 
to raise their objections to our Jurisdiction in the correct 
forum: they should have referred their challenge to us. 
We also found that the Arbitration agreement is 
separable from the Contractual Agreement. We have 
found that the LCIA arbitration clause is a valid and 
subsisting Arbitration agreement which bound the Parties 
to have their disputes under the Contractual Agreement 
resolved through London arbitration at the LCIA and that 
Respondents had lost the opportunity in any event, to 
challenge our jurisdiction because they took steps in the 
reference before they served their letter of 27 July 2016 
giving notice for the first time that they were challenging 

 
Civil Original Suit No.80492 of 2017                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   28 
 
our jurisdiction in proceedings brought before the Court 
of Lahore. 
Finally, we have found that the Contractual Agreement 
itself was validly concluded.” 
 
Underlying for emphasis  
 
26. 
Furthermore, it was decided in the “Award of Jurisdiction” 
that the “Agreement” was signed and stamped by the parties and 
following observations were made: 
 
“Given that the Contractual Agreement, containing an 
Arbitration clause, was signed and stamped by both parties, and 
on Respondents’ behalf by the same person who had signed a 
number of previous sales contracts (17 previous contracts, 
according to claimants) with Claimants, Respondents’ case 
appeared, at first glance, unsustainable. We noted that 
Respondents did not contend that the Contractual Agreement 
had not been made, but rather that it had been made by persons 
without the authorization of the Board of Directors”. 
 
  
It was further decided that  
 
“35. 
It is not for Claimants to know who is or is not 
authorized to sign on behalf of Respondents, or whether the 
Contractual Agreement itself had to be ratified by the Board. 
Claimants' were entitled to deal with persons who it was 
reasonable for them to believe represented Respondents and 
had appropriate authorization to bind Respondents. In this case, 
Claimants had negotiated the Contractual Agreement with Mr. 
Ali Altaf Saleem, one of two Executive Directors of 
Respondents, as well as the General Manager of Sales and 
Marketing, Mr. Akhtar Habib. Both of them had previously 
negotiated several contracts with Claimants and there was no 
change or other indication from Respondents that neither Mr. 
Saleem nor Mr. Habib had ceased to be authorised to bind the 
company. Claimants described Mr. Saleem as one of the two key 
executives in Respondents' company: he was said to be a 
Member of the Executive Committee (comprised of himself and 
the Chief Executive) and a five man Business Strategy 
Committee, which Respondents' Annual Report (for the year end 
30 September 2015, dated 8 January 2016 and published on 
Respondents' website), described as being "responsible for the 
formulation of business strategy, review of risks and their 
mitigation plan", It follows, and we had no hesitation in finding, 
that Mr. Saleem and Mr. Habib had ostensible authority, if not 
actual authority, to enter into the Contractual Agreement”. 
 
27.  
As noted above, the “Shakarganj” has argued about invalidity 
of the “Agreement” under Article V(1)(a) of the “NY Convention”. 
The said argument is not correct as the validity of the “Agreement”, 
under the aforesaid Article, has to be considered “under the law to 

 
Civil Original Suit No.80492 of 2017                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   29 
 
which the parties have subjected it or failing any indication thereon, 
under the law of the country where the award was made” and in this 
case, the parties have clearly subjected to English law as per 
arbitration clause of the “Agreement” which itself states that “any 
dispute arising out of this contract shall be settled in accordance with 
English law and the governing law of the “Agreement” is subject to 
by English Law”. From aforesaid, it is quite clear from the language 
used in the “Agreement” that it does not suggest any intention that 
the “Agreement” was to be subject to any other law than the law 
applicable to the “Agreement”. In both the jurisdictions i.e. Pakistani 
and English law, it is presumed that the law applicable to a 
contract/agreement will also apply to an arbitration agreement 
contained within it, in the absence of any indication to the contrary. 
The said situation has already been dealt with by the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Hitachi Limited Versus 
Rupali Polyester” (1998 SCMR 1618) by holding that “if there is no 
express agreement between the parties as to the law governing 
arbitration agreement, the law which governs the main agreement 
will also govern arbitration agreement if the arbitration clause is 
embedded as a part of the main agreement”.  
  
The English Court in the case of Enka Insaat Ve Sanayi AS v 
Insurance Company Chubb [2020] UKSC 38, held that “where the 
law applicable to the arbitration agreement is not specified, a choice 
of governing law for the contract will generally apply to an 
arbitration agreement which forms part of the contract. 
  
Further in Kabab-Ji SAL v Kout Food Group [2021] UKSC 48 
held that “once it is accepted that an express agreement as to the law 
which is to govern the arbitration agreement is not required and that 
any form of agreement will suffice, it seems difficult to resist the 
conclusion that a general choice of law clause in a written contract 
containing an arbitration clause will normally be a sufficient 
“indication” of the law to which the parties subjected the arbitration 
agreement.

28.  
In view of above referred case laws and discussion, the 
objection of the “Shakarganj” with regard to invalidity of the 
“Agreement” is not valid. Even otherwise, the “Shakarganj” has not 
furnished any proof in its support regarding invalidity of agreement 
under the law as no document was filed with the reply. 
Moot Point No.4 (Unenforceability of “Final Award” contrary to public 
policy of Pakistan)  
29. 
The next objection of the “Shakarganj” is with regard to 
enforceability of the “Agreement” on the ground that it is contrary to 
the public policy of the Pakistan which is based on Article V 2(b) of 
the “NY Convention”. For brevity, the said Article is reproduced 
below:  
2. Recognition and enforcement of an arbitral 
award may also be refused if the competent 
authority in the country where recognition and 
enforcement is sought finds that:- 
 
(a) … … … ; or 
 
(b) The recognition or enforcement of the 
award would be contrary to the public policy 
of that country (emphasis added). 
 
  
Bare perusal of Section 7 of the “Act” read with Article V 2(b) 
of the “NY Convention” reveals that the recognition and enforcement 
of an arbitral award may also be refused if the competent authority in 
Pakistan finds that the recognition or enforcement of the award 
would be contrary to the “public policy” of Pakistan. Accordingly, to 
avail benefit of Article V 2(b) of the “NY Convention”, the 
“Shakarganj” must satisfy this Court that the recognition or 
enforcement of the award would be contrary to the “public policy” of 
Pakistan.  
30. 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan has alluded to the concept of 
‘public policy’ in the case of “ORIENT POWER COMPANY 
(PRIVATE) LIMITED through Authorized Officer Versus SUI 
NORTHERN GAS PIPELINES LIMITED through Managing 
Director” (2019 CLD 1069) by holding that: 
 

 
Civil Original Suit No.80492 of 2017                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   31 
 
“The wording "incompatible with the public policy of the 
country in which is award is sought to be relied upon" was 
recommended, the reasoning behind the same was that the 
public policy criterion should not be given a broad scope of 
application. The Convention adopted the draft of Working 
Party III, which now reads as Article V(2)(b) under the New 
York Convention. 
 
104. Article V(2)(b)'s defense of public policy is one ground 
that is frequently invoked by a party resisting enforcement of 
the award, but rarely is it granted. We find that it would be 
remiss if we did not echo the Learned High Court in quoting 
the words of an English Court upon this issue, which are by 
now almost inextricably linked to this topic and oft cited: 
"public policy is a very unruly horse, and once you get 
astride it you never know where it will carry you. It may lead 
you from sound law. It is never argued at all, but when other 
points fail." 
 
105. Another frequently cited judicial comment on public 
policy is from Judge Joseph Smith in Parsons and 
Whittemore Overseas Inc. v. RAKTA,68 who observed that the 
public policy defense ought only to succeed where 
enforcement of the award would violate the forum State's 
most basic notions of morality and justice. 
 
106. The recent Privy Council decision of Betamax Ltd 
(Appellant) v State Trading Corporation (Respondent) 
(Mauritius)69 is of some guidance, in which, on appeal, the 
Privy Council overturned the decision of the Supreme Court 
of Mauritius which had set aside an award for being 
contrary to the public policy of Mauritius, because the 
underlying contract between the parties was in breach of the 
public procurement law of Mauritius. The Board held that 
the court was not entitled to use the guise of public policy to 
reopen issues relating to the meaning and effect of a contract 
or whether it complies with a regulatory or legislative 
scheme. For that reasons the decision of the Supreme Court 
of Mauritius setting aside the Award fell to be reversed”. 
 
31. 
The above case has also been relied by this Court in the case of 
POSCO INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION supra, which held as 
follows: 
16.  To recapitulate the said provision provides that the 
recognition and enforcement of an arbitral award may also be 
refused if the competent authority in the country finds that the 
award would be contrary to the public policy of that country. 
The term "public policy" has been subject of interpretation of 
courts all around the world and still remains an extremely 
fluid term not capable of definite meaning. It is notoriously 
slippery and inherently vague. ….. 
 
20.  The Supreme Court was clearly of the opinion that the 
definition of public policy even if invoked by a party is rarely 
granted and referred to the observations made by an English 
Judge to the effect that the public policy was an unruly horse 
and once you get astride it, you never know where it will carry 

 
Civil Original Suit No.80492 of 2017                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   32 
 
you. Further that the courts all around the world have favored 
a restrictive approach to the question of public policy in 
arbitration and that Pakistan as a responsible nation has to 
develop jurisprudence while remaining cautious of the purpose 
of the parties to opt for arbitration and who are seeking speedy 
settlement of disputes which ought not be impeded by a party 
resorting to litigation once an award is rendered. In short, the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan favored an approach of non-
interference and a pro-enforcement policy. Lastly, it was held 
that public policy exception could not be used as a back door 
to review the merits of a foreign arbitral award or to create 
grounds which were not available under Article V of the 
Schedule to the Act, 2011. The holding of the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan is the correct view and is currently the law of the 
country and I shall respectfully follow the views expressed in 
Orient Power Company rather than follow the Supreme Court 
of India. 
 
 
21.  In the context of the public policy defence, learned counsel 
for Rikans submitted that an application under section 4(2) of 
the Act, 2011 had been filed by POSCO and so POSCO could 
not have invoked the jurisdiction of SIAC simultaneously and 
ought to have awaited the final determination of the issues 
before the Civil Court at Lahore regarding section 4 
application. On this basis it is contended that the reference to 
SIAC dated 17.9.2018 is contrary to section 4 of the Act, 2011. 
This argument has no basis and cannot prosper. It simply 
cannot succeed on the ground that the claim before the Civil 
Court had been filed by Rikans and it was the right of POSCO 
to file an application seeking stay of the proceedings and for 
referral of the matter to Arbitration under the arbitration 
clause. Section 4 of the Act, 2011 is in any case an obligation 
cast on the courts of Pakistan to see that in case the parties 
have entered into an arbitration agreement, the referral should 
on that basis be made to the Arbitration Tribunal and the 
claim should not be agitated before the Civil Courts. In the 
opinion of Rikans, having invoked the jurisdiction of the trial 
court under section 4 of the Act, 2011, POSCO was required to 
await the determination. This is a misplaced notion as POSCO 
had not invoked the jurisdiction of the Civil Court at Lahore 
who had merely filed an application to seek a stay of the 
proceedings and to enjoin the courts at Lahore to refer the 
parties to arbitration. POSCO was compelled to file the 
application and did not itself invoke the jurisdiction of the 
Civil Court at Lahore. A related argument raised by Rikans is 
that in the absence of referral by the trial court, the award 
which was issued by the Arbitration Tribunal falls afoul of the 
Pakistani law. Once again this argument is unsubstantiated 
and fanciful. It seems that Rikans by raising this argument 
invites this Court to hold that in every case a referral by a 
court in Pakistan is sine qua non for the arbitration 
proceedings to commence before the Arbitration Tribunal. 
There is no such requirement in law and the Civil Courts at 
Lahore were involved only because Rikans chose to file a 
claim before the Civil Court, Lahore contrary to its obligation 
under the arbitration agreement to refer the matter to 
Arbitration. There was no violation of Pakistani law or the 
public policy as alleged by Rikans since the public policy 
contained in section 4 of the Act, 2011 is very clear. It obliges 

 
Civil Original Suit No.80492 of 2017                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   33 
 
and compels parties to an arbitration agreement to take their 
claims to the tribunals agreed for resolution of disputes by the 
parties and further requires the courts in Pakistan to refer the 
parties to arbitration. This is the public policy of Pakistan and 
must be adhered to. 
 
32.  
The US Courts have taken a conservative approach to interfere 
with international arbitration and the issue of public policy. The 
seminal case highlighting the American pro-arbitration approach in 
the case of Scherk v Alberto-Culver Co, 417 US 506 (1974) by 
holding that: 
“The invalidation of such an agreement in the case 
before us would reflect a parochial concept that all 
disputes must be resolved under our laws and in our 
courts. We cannot have trade and commerce in world 
markets and international waters exclusively on our 
terms, governed by our laws, and resolved in our 
courts”.  
 
33. 
In England, the enforcement and recognition of foreign arbitral 
awards under the New York Convention are governed under the 
Arbitration Act, 1996, Ss. 100-103. In Russell on Arbitration, 24th 
edition, the concept of refusal of recognition and enforcement, in the 
paradigm of the policy of the Convention, has been stated thus:  
 
“Refusal of recognition and enforcement. The 
grounds on which recognition of New York 
Convention awards will be refused under ss. 101-103 
of the 1996 Act are very limited. Section 103 
accordingly embodies a pro-enforcement approach. 
So unless the ground for refusal falls within the terms 
of s.103, the court must recognize and enforce a New 
York Convention award. The court also apparently 
has a very limited discretion to enforce the award 
even where one or more of the grounds are made 
out.” 
 
34.  
The Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Orient Power 
Company (Private) Limited (supra) has alluded to the concept of 
public policy in the following words: 
“110. Therefore, it is easy to adduce the hesitance of 
courts and drafters alike in invoking public policy 
frivolously and without the most exceptional of 
circumstances. Most courts world over have favoured 
a 
restrictive 
approach 
to 
public 
policy 
in 
international commercial arbitration. It is imperative 
that, Pakistan is one of the countries that have yet to 
develop jurisprudence on international commercial 
arbitration, and we must be cautious, and ought to 

 
Civil Original Suit No.80492 of 2017                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   34 
 
adopt standards of practice in line with the 
international community. There is also a need to 
develop best standing practices for our own courts, 
which are seeing a rise in cases pertaining to 
international 
commercial 
arbitration; 
therefore, 
there is an utmost need to deliver precedent that is 
consistent and does not open floodgates to frivolous 
litigation. Indeed, the very purpose of parties going 
to arbitration is the (relatively) speedy settlement of 
disputes, which ought not to be impeded by a party 
resorting to litigation once an award is rendered. 
 
111. The jurisdiction of courts under international 
commercial arbitration is merely supervisory; we 
deem it necessary to step in under circumstances, 
where, if not remedied, the arbitration award or 
agreement could lead to an unfair outcome for one of 
the parties. This is in no way means that domestic 
awards would be treated less favourably than foreign 
awards, but rather, the aim is to create a level 
playing field between the two and treat them at par. 
 
112. A restrictive interpretation on challenge to 
enforcement of an award would therefore, ensure 
finality of award at its last stage, giving greater 
certainty to parties after having gone through 
rigorous arbitrations. The New York Convention 
itself advocates for a "pro-enforcement bias" and we 
are mindful of the same. 
 
We hold that awarding a greater quantum of 
compensation than that was due by an Arbitral 
Tribunal does not amount to violation of public 
policy, as the same would open floodgates and would 
require the courts to undertake an examination of 
each and every award, which is against the very 
spirit of the New York Convention. Resultantly, we 
hold that the award rendered by the Sole Arbitrator 
was not in violation of the public policy of Pakistan”. 
 
35. 
In the context of the public policy defence, learned counsel for 
the “Shakarganj” Ms. Deeba Tasneem Anwar, Advocate submitted 
that the “Shakarganj” had approached the Civil Court in Pakistan 
which had granted interim injunction and the Tribunal ought to have 
awaited the final determination of the issues before the Civil Court. 
This argument has no basis and cannot prosper. It is also 
unsubstantiated and fanciful. There is no such requirement in law and 
the Civil Court was involved only because the “Shakarganj” chose to 
file a claim before the Civil Court, contrary to its obligation under the 
arbitration agreement to refer the matter to Arbitration. The 
“Shakarganj” was in breach of the arbitration agreement by 

 
Civil Original Suit No.80492 of 2017                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   35 
 
commencing proceedings at Civil Court, and this action of the 
“Shakarganj” was also against the Pakistani law, as held earlier, only 
the High Court has jurisdiction to entertain such matters. There is no 
known public policy which constrains this Court from enforcing the 
award on the premise that one of the parties has brought a claim in the 
local courts. This is necessary to maintain the integrity of international 
commercial contracts and the trust in Pakistani courts to enforce 
foreign awards. That trust will be shaken irretrievably if the courts of 
Pakistan were to evince an anti-enforcement policy by seeking shelter 
in the nebulous concept of 'public policy'. Accordingly, this objection 
is also baseless because there was no violation of Pakistani law or the 
public policy as alleged by the “Shakarganj”. The “Act” obliges and 
compels parties to an arbitration agreement to take their claims to the 
tribunals agreed for resolution of disputes by the parties and further 
requires the courts in Pakistan to refer the parties to arbitration. This is 
the public policy of Pakistan and must be adhered to. 
Moot Point No.5 (Pro-Enforcement Bias or Policy) 
 
36. 
Before passing any determination on the above moot 
questions, it is essential to discuss the vision behind enactment of the 
“Act”, i.e. the NY Convention. It is to be noted that the “NY 
Convention” was passed in New York in 1958 to provide a uniform 
and effective legal framework for the recognition and enforcement of 
international arbitration agreements and foreign arbitral awards. The 
aims of the “NY Convention”, generally, are to promote international 
trade and commerce by ensuring that parties to an arbitration 
agreement could enforce their rights and obligations under that 
agreement in any of the countries that have ratified the “NY 
Convention”; to establish a comprehensive legal framework for the 
recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards by national 
courts around the world; and to reduce uncertainty and risk in 
international commerce for the growth of international trade and 
investment. 

 
Civil Original Suit No.80492 of 2017                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   36 
 
37. 
Since Pakistan ratified the NY Convention in 2005, it passed 
the Recognition and Enforcement (Arbitration Agreements and 
Foreign Arbitral Awards) Ordinance, 2005 to fulfil its international 
commitments under the “NY Convention”. The said Ordinance was 
re-promulgated in 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010, and finally the “Act” 
was enacted in 2011. The “Act” has repealed the earlier Arbitration 
(Protocol and Convention) Act, 1937, and is conspicuous for its 
brevity and shortness.  
38. 
Here, it would also be advantageous to highlight the purpose 
and policy of the “Act”, which is mentioned in its Preamble. The 
preamble means an introductory statement in a constitution, statute or 
act, and it explains the basis and objective of such a document. 
Though the preamble to a statute is not an operational part of the 
enactment but it is a gateway, which discusses the purpose and intent 
of the legislature to necessitate the legislation on the subject and also 
sheds clear light on the goals that the legislator aims to secure through 
the introduction of such law. The preamble of a statute, therefore, 
holds a pivotal role for the purposes of interpretation in order to 
dissect the true purpose and intent of the law. Reliance in this regard 
is placed on “DIRECTOR GENERAL, FIA AND OTHERS Versus 
KAMRAN IQBAL and others” (2016 SCMR 447).  
39. 
The Preamble of the Act duly notes that Pakistan is a signatory 
to the NY Convention. As per its Preamble, the Act has been passed 
to provide a framework “for the recognition and enforcement of 
arbitration agreements and foreign arbitral awards pursuant to [NY] 
Convention and for matters connected therewith”. The purpose of the 
“Act” has further been elaborated in the case of “Orient Power 
Company Versus Sui Northern Gas Pipelines” (PLD 2019 Lahore 
607) wherein it has held that “the purpose of the Act is to facilitate 
recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral award in order to 
curtail litigation related to foreign arbitral awards which in turn 
delays the enforcement of awards and negates the very purpose for 
using arbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism. The 
Convention is based on a pro-enforcement policy which sets out to 

 
Civil Original Suit No.80492 of 2017                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   37 
 
facilitate and safeguard the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards 
which is the mandate of the Act. The emphasis on pro-enforcement 
is highlighted by the inclusion of Section 8 of the Act which 
provides that in the event of any inconsistency between the Act and 
the Convention, the Convention shall prevail to the extent of the 
inconsistency”. 
40. 
It is also imperative to highlight another case of the honorable 
Sindh High Court, titled “DHANYA AGRO-INDUSTRIAL (PVT.) 
LIMITED through Attorney Versus QUETTA TEXTILE MILLS LTD. 
through Chief Executive” (2019 CLD 160) which mentions that very 
intention of the Act is to expedite the process. By giving fast-track 
enforceability to the arbitral award granted between members of the 
NY Convention, the parties affected by misadventures of others could 
seek expeditious disposal of their cases and remedies were made 
forthcoming in an expeditious manner without any unnecessary loss 
of time. 
41. 
Accordingly, the Preamble of the “Act” provides an 
expeditious mechanism for the recognition and enforcement of 
foreign arbitral agreements and foreign arbitral awards pursuant to the 
“NY Convention”. Since the “Final Award” has been made by the 
“LCIA” against the parties who belong to the consented countries and 
are bound by the “NY Convention” therefore, comes within the 
meaning of Section 2(e) of the “Act” which states “a foreign arbitral 
award made in a Contracting State and such other State as may be 
notified by the Federal Government in the official Gazette.” Article 
III of the “NY Convention” provides that “Each Contracting State 
shall recognize arbitral awards as binding and enforce them in 
accordance with the rules of procedure of the territory where the 
award is relied upon, under the conditions laid down in the follows 
articles.”  
42. 
Interestingly, the Pakistani superior courts have recognized the 
concept of “pro-enforcement policy” or “pro-enforcement bias” in a 
number of judgments. It has been held in the case of “ABDULLAH 
Versus 
Messrs 
CNAN 
GROUP 
SPA 
through

Executive/Managing Director and another” (PLD 2014 Sindh 349) 
as follows: 
5.         One point that has been widely recognized in relation 
to the Convention is its pro-enforcement "bias". The 
Convention is designed to facilitate speedy enforcement of 
awards made in Convention countries in other States party to 
it. Thus, in the (English) Court of Appeal, in Lombard-Knight 
and another v. Rainstorm Pictures Inc [2014] EWCA Civ 356, 
Tomlinson, LJ observed as follows:-- 
  
            "35. ... The International Council for Commercial 
Arbitration (ICCA) has produced a Guide to the Interpretation 
of the 1958 New York Convention: A Handbook for Judges 
(May 2012 edition) ("ICCA Guide") which sets out the 
questions to be answered and the steps to be followed by the 
courts when applying the Convention. The Guide summarises 
the overall object and purpose of the New York Convention as 
follows: 
  
            "The Convention is based on a pro-enforcement bias. It 
facilitates and safeguards the enforcement of arbitration 
agreements and arbitral awards and in doing so it serves 
international trade and commerce. It provides an additional 
measure of commercial security for parties entering into cross-
border transactions." 
  
            36. The pro-enforcement basis of the New York 
Convention is also supported by Van den Berg in his work to 
which I have already referred above, as did Mance LJ in 
[Dardana Limited v. Yukos Oil Company [2002] EWCA Civ 
543, [2002] 2 Lloyd's Rep 326], at page 4: 
  
            "As far as the object and purpose of the New York 
Convention are concerned, they are to facilitate the 
enforcement of arbitration agreements within its purview and 
of foreign arbitral awards. This object and purpose must, in 
the first place, be seen in the light of enhancing the 
effectiveness of the legal regime governing international 
commercial arbitration." 
  
            (The Guide abovementioned is available on the 
Internet: 
http:// 
www.arbitration-
icca.org/publications/NYC_Guide.html.) Reference may also 
be made to a recent decision from Australia, that of the 
Supreme Court of Victoria (in its Court of Appeal division) in 
IMC Aviation Solutions Pty Ltd. v. Altain Khuder LLC [2011] 
VSCA 248. The Court was there considering the Convention in 
light of a commonwealth statute, the International Arbitration 
Act, 1974, which implements the Convention in Australia. In 
their joint judgment, Hansen JA and Kyrou AJA made a 
number of observations of which the following can be usefully 
cited (internal citations omitted):-- 
  
            "128. Secondly, the Act, and the Convention, reflect 
what is often described as a `proenforcement bias' or policy. 
What that means is this. The Act, and the Convention, 
recognising the role and importance of arbitration in 

 
Civil Original Suit No.80492 of 2017                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   39 
 
international trade and commerce and the certainty and 
finality of awards, has simplified the procedure for enforcing 
foreign arbitral awards while also limiting the grounds upon 
which the enforcement of such an award may be resisted and 
placed the onus of establishing those grounds upon the party 
resisting enforcement. In Redfern and Bunter on International 
Arbitration, it is said of the expression a pro-enforcement bias' 
that it 'means that whilst it may be possible to challenge an 
arbitral award, the available options are likely to be limited. 
Sir Anthony Mason has described the objective of the 
Convention as being 'to encourage the recognition and 
enforcement of commercial arbitration agreements in 
international contracts and to unify the standards by which 
agreements to arbitrate are observed and arbitral awards are 
enforced.' 
  
            129. The Act's pro-enforcement policy is relevant to the 
interpretation of particular provisions of the Act. Hence, in 
Parsons & Whittemore Overseas Co. Inc v. Societe Generale 
de L'Industrie du Papier (Rakta) [508 F. 2d 969, 974 (US 
Court of Appeals, 2nd Cir, 1974), I YCA 205 (1976)], it was 
held that the public policy ground of resistance to the 
enforcement of an award was to be given a narrow 
construction as meaning contrary to the basic notions of 
morality and justice of the forum. That is consistent with the 
attainment of the objects of the Act and the Convention. It 
would be inappropriate, however, for this Court to give to a 
provision of the Act a meaning which is not supported by the 
words used by the Parliament, construed in accordance with 
conventional principles of statutory interpretation, for the 
purpose of giving effect to the pro-enforcement policy. 
  
            130. Thirdly, as the Act gives effect to the Convention, 
decisions of overseas courts on the meaning of provisions of 
domestic legislation that adopt the wording of the Convention 
may be of assistance in the interpretation of the Act. Apart 
from promoting comity, there are obvious advantages in 
consistency in the interpretation of legislation that gives effect 
to an international convention. In that regard, however, it will 
be important to note any relevant differences in the legislation 
of another jurisdiction." 
  
            I respectfully agree. Reference may also be made to 
Glencore Grain Rotterdam B.V. v. Shivnath Rai Harnarain Co. 
284 F. 3d 1114 (US Court of Appeals, 9th Cir, 2002), XXVII 
YCA 922 (2002), where it was observed as follows:-- 
  
            "The 
Convention 
and 
its 
implementing 
legislation have a pro-enforcement bias, a policy long-
recognized by the Supreme Court: 
  
            `The goal of the Convention, and the principal 
purpose 
underlying 
American 
adoption 
and 
implementation of it, was to encourage the recognition 
and enforcement of commercial arbitration agreements 
in international contracts and to unify the standards by 
which agreements to arbitrate are observed and 
arbitral awards are enforced in the signatory

   40 
 
countries. Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., 417 U.S. 
506,520 n. 151". 
 
13.       The foregoing conclusion as regards the interpretation 
of section 7 is also borne out by the pro-enforcement bias of 
the Convention, as noted above. It is quite clear that, wherever 
possible, the Convention seeks to reduce the manner and stage 
of challenging an award. Of course, this does not mean that 
such a challenge is eliminated altogether. What it does mean, 
in my view, is that if the relevant statute in the lex fori does not 
so provide either expressly or by necessary implication, then a 
challenge or objection to an award must be regarded as being 
limited to proceedings brought by the award-creditor. I 
cannot, with respect, agree with what appears to be the rather 
more expansive approach suggested in Kronke (op. cit.). 
Certainly, in my view, the case law cited above does not 
support such a conclusion. Secondly, section 8 of the 2011 Act 
must also be kept in mind. It is a highly unusual provision. The 
normal rule of interpretation is of course that if there is any 
inconsistency between the main provisions of a statute and any 
schedule thereto, the former are to prevail (see, e.g., the well 
known observations of the Supreme Court in Excise and 
Taxation Officer, Karachi and another v. Burmah Shell 
Storbge and Distribution Company of Pakistan and others 
(1993 SCMR 338). Section 8 expressly reverses the normal 
rule: in case of any inconsistency, the Convention is to prevail 
and the provisions of the 2011 Act must yield. The inclusion of 
such a section in the 2011 Act also points, in my view, towards 
the conclusion that I have arrived at in relation to section 7. 
 
43. 
Similarly, in the case of “LOUIS DREYFUS COMMODITIES 
SUISSE S.A. Versus ACRO TEXTILE MILLS LTD” (PLD 2018 
Lahore 597), this Court has again recognized this concept as 
follows: 
16.       Thus the general pro-enforcement bias which 
permeates the Act, 2011 is the policy of the law and must be 
the underlying thrust to liberalise procedures for enforcing 
foreign arbitral awards. The courts, on a proper objective 
analysis must give effect to the intention of the legislature and 
the purpose of the New York Convention, in the enforcement of 
foreign arbitral awards. The centrality of the statutory 
enterprise consists in shunning a tendency to view the 
application with scepticism and to consider the arbitral award 
as having a sound legal and foundational element. This 
presumption is for the respondent to rebut upon proof being 
furnished. More importantly, the policy of the Act, 2011 
requires this Court to dispose of issues by the usual test for 
summary judgment, and not by a regular trial. 
 
44. 
Likewise, the same principle has also been adopted by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of ORIENT POWER 
COMPANY (PRIVATE) LIMITED (supra) as follows: 
 

 
Civil Original Suit No.80492 of 2017                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   41 
 
112. A restrictive interpretation on challenge to enforcement of 
an award would therefore, ensure finality of award at its last 
stage, giving greater certainty to parties after having gone 
through rigorous arbitrations. The New York Convention itself 
advocates for a "pro-enforcement bias" and we are mindful of 
the same. 
 
113. This does not in any way mean that the pro-enforcement 
bias impedes State interests however, and where a claim for 
violation of public policy is made, due care and attention 
ought to be awarded to that claim. However, one must be 
mindful that the public policy defense is an exceptional one at 
that, which demands heightened standards of proof that courts 
would normally require in order to refuse recognition and 
enforcement of a foreign arbitral award. Thus the Canadian 
courts have requested that the party opposing recognition and 
enforcement should present compelling evidence, and that 
recognition and enforcement should only be refused in 
instances of a "patently unreasonable award". 
 
120. We agree with the finding of the Learned High Court at 
paragraph 57 of the Impugned Judgment, wherein it is stated: 
            "…[the] non-interference or the pro-enforcement 
policy is in itself a policy of Contracting States, which is not 
easily persuaded by the public policy exception argument… 
The public policy exception acts as a safeguard of fundamental 
notions of morality and justice, such that the enforcement of a 
foreign award may offend these fundamentals… [T]he public 
policy exception should not become a back door to review the 
merits of a foreign arbitral award or to create grounds which 
are not available under Article V of the Convention as this 
would negate the obligation to recognize and enforce foreign 
arbitral awards. Such kind of interference would essentially 
nullify the need for arbitration clauses as parties will be 
encouraged to challenge foreign awards on the public policy 
ground knowing that there is room to have the Court set aside 
the award." 
 
45.  
In addition, this Court has very recently reiterated this 
principle in the case of POSCO INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION 
supra, as follows: 
20.  The Supreme Court was clearly of the opinion that the 
definition of public policy even if invoked by a party is rarely 
granted and referred to the observations made by an English 
Judge to the effect that the public policy was an unruly horse 
and once you get astride it, you never know where it will carry 
you. Further that the courts all around the world have favored 
a restrictive approach to the question of public policy in 
arbitration and that Pakistan as a responsible nation has to 
develop jurisprudence while remaining cautious of the purpose 
of the parties to opt for arbitration and who are seeking speedy 
settlement of disputes which ought not be impeded by a party 
resorting to litigation once an award is rendered. In short, the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan favored an approach of non-
interference and a pro-enforcement policy. Lastly, it was held 
that public policy exception could not be used as a back door 
to review the merits of a foreign arbitral award or to create 

 
Civil Original Suit No.80492 of 2017                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   42 
 
grounds which were not available under Article V of the 
Schedule to the Act, 2011. The holding of the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan is the correct view and is currently the law of the 
country and I shall respectfully follow the views expressed in 
Orient Power Company rather than follow the Supreme Court 
of India. 
 
46. 
The 
“NY 
Convention” 
in 
Article 
V 
advocates  
‘pro-enforcement bias’ policy in dealing with applications of 
recognition and enforcement of international arbitral awards. It sets 
forth the general principle that each contracting state shall recognize 
arbitral awards as binding and enforce them. As a result, foreign 
awards are entitled to a prima facie right to enforcement in the 
contracting states. Essentially, it means the pro-enforcement attitude 
of the national courts enforcing foreign award. Enunciating the same, 
the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in the case of Yukos Oil 
vs. Dardana, [2001] EWCA Civ 1077 held that, “pursuant to pro-
enforcement bias principle, foreign arbitral awards are entitled to a 
prima facie right to recognition and enforcement.” As Pakistan is also 
a signatory of the “NY Convention”, the Pakistani arbitration 
framework should be in line with the principle of pro-enforcement 
bias. The Pakistani legislature, furthering the same, introduced the 
“Act” in 2011. In order to develop this doctrine, this Court examined 
the preamble of the “Act” which provides for the recognition and 
enforcement of arbitration agreements and foreign arbitral award. 
The foreign arbitral awards are mentioned under Section 2(e) of the 
“Act” which means a foreign arbitral award made in a Contracting 
State and such other State as may be notified by the Federal 
Government. The jurisprudence developed in Pakistan after ratifying 
the “NY Convention” and enactment of the “Act”, the Courts have 
enforced the awards through pronouncements of judgments and such 
enforcement casts upon a duty on the Courts to build the confidence 
of investors by protecting the sanctity of arbitration agreements and 
the same has already been dealt with by this Court in the case of 
“M.C.R. (PVT.) LTD. FRANCHISEE OF PIZZA HUT Versus 
MULTAN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY and others” (2021 CLD 
639)  by observing that: 

 
Civil Original Suit No.80492 of 2017                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   43 
 
 
“26. 
With each passing day, the World is becoming 
more global and more inter-connected, particularly in 
the affairs of trade and commerce. The volume of foreign 
investment and number of such business initiatives are 
taken as one of the determining traits for measuring 
economic growth of a country and it has also a direct 
bearing upon the financial prosperity of the citizens of a 
country.  
 
27. Article 4 of the Constitution guarantees equal 
protection of law and fundamental right to be treated in 
accordance with law as inalienable right of every citizen 
"wherever he may be, and of every other person for the 
time being within Pakistan". Simultaneously, Article 5 of 
the Constitution unequivocally laid down that obedience 
to the Constitution and law is the inviolable obligation of 
"every citizen wherever he may be, and of every other 
person for the time being within Pakistan". It is thus 
evidently clear that the enjoyment of rights is made 
subject to abiding of the law and fundamental right of 
inviolability of equality before the law is equally 
corresponded with the obligation of obedience to the 
Constitution and the law, both for the citizen and for any 
other person who is for the time being in Pakistan. The 
Constitution is grundnorm of the country and law is the 
command of sovereign body, which is established and 
mandated under the Constitution to promulgate and 
enact laws either in the form of primary legislation i.e., 
Acts and Ordinance etc. or in the form of delegated 
legislation. Similarly, under Article 189 and Article 201 
of the Constitution, the decisions of the Supreme Court 
and High Courts to the extent of decision on a question of 
law or enunciation on the principle of law, are also 
binding on all the Courts of the country and in the 
particular Province, as the case may be. It is therefore 
imperative and obligatory upon the citizen as well as any 
person of foreign nationality, who is for the time being in 
Pakistan, to adhere and abide by the Constitution, the 
law and judgments of the constitutional Courts of the 
country and on the other hand, he has a fundamental 
inviolable right of equal protection of the law.  
 
28. Undoubtedly freedom of trade, business and 
commerce is a fundamental right guaranteed under 
Article 18 of the Constitution which states that every 
citizen shall have the right to enter upon any lawful 
profession or occupation, and to conduct any lawful 
trade or business. One of the basic purposes behind 
provision of this fundamental right is certainly to 
advance culture of socio-economic progress and to 
protect and promote business and trade activities and, at 
the same time, to encourage simplification of the process 
of establishing and carrying out new business ventures 
throughout the country because activities of business and 
trade create opportunities for the masses around and 
provide job options, financial stability and progress in 
the area.

29. Since the Pizza Hut is an international chain and 
entered into lease agreement with WASA, it is the duty of 
the Courts in Pakistan to see the rights of the parties and 
to protect their interest in order to build confidence of 
investors in Pakistan but at the same time the interest of 
government functionaries has also to be examined 
regarding financial interest of the Government. The 
learned Civil/Commercial Court is, therefore, directed to 
decide the case expeditiously but not later than 60 days 
from the receipt of copy of this judgment in accordance 
with law.”  
 
47. 
Accordingly, in view of the above, it remains clear that a  
pro-enforcement policy under the “NY Convention” refers to a legal 
approach that favors the recognition and enforcement of foreign 
arbitral awards. This approach is based on the principle of comity, 
which requires countries to show respect and deference to the legal 
systems and decisions of other countries and arbitral tribunals. Pro-
enforcement policy under the “NY Convention” is important because 
it promotes the finality and enforceability of arbitration awards. 
When parties agree to resolve their disputes through arbitration, they 
expect that the resulting award will be final and binding. A pro-
enforcement policy helps to ensure that parties can rely on the 
arbitration process to resolve their disputes and that the resulting 
awards will be enforced in other countries. In practice, a pro-
enforcement policy means that courts should apply a narrow standard 
of review when considering applications for recognition and 
enforcement of foreign arbitral awards. This standard requires courts 
to limit their review to procedural matters and to refrain from re-
examining the substance of the dispute. This approach ensures that 
the recognition and enforcement process is swift and efficient, which 
benefits both parties and promotes international trade and commerce. 
Overall, a pro-enforcement policy under the “NY Convention” is 
essential to promote the recognition and enforcement of foreign 
arbitral awards. This approach reflects the importance of promoting 
finality and enforceability in the arbitration process, which in turn 
contributes to the stability and predictability of international 
commerce. Therefore, this Court is bound to implement it as such.

IX. 
Conclusion  
 
48. 
In view of above, it is unequivocal that the “Shakarganj” has 
failed to defend its foreign arbitration award on the grounds raised 
under Section 7 of the “Act” read with Article V 2(b) of the “NY 
Convention” neither by its conduct while appearing before the 
“LCIA” nor by filing proper documents under the “Act” and even 
the reply filed before this Court. It is to be examined that the 
“Shakarganj” 
filed 
reply 
(four 
pages only) 
without 
any 
document/annexure by taking preliminary objections which have 
been discussed in details above, whereas, the “Tradhol” filed the 
“Application” under Section 6 of the “Act” read with Article IV of 
the “NY Convention” and met with all requirements for enforcement 
of the “Final Award”. Section 6 is reproduced below: 
6. 
Enforcement of foreign arbitral award.--
- (1) Unless the Court pursuant to section 7, 
refuse the application seeking recognition and 
enforcement of a foreign arbitral award, the 
Court shall recognize and enforce the award in 
the same manner as a judgment or order of the 
Court in Pakistan. …. 
 
  
While Section 6 read with Article III of the “NY Convention” 
is subservient to Section 7 of the “Act” read with Article IV and V of 
the “NY Convention”, which if satisfied, the Court shall recognize 
and enforce the foreign arbitral award in the same manner as a 
judgment or order of the Court in Pakistan.  
51. 
As deliberated in detail by this Court in the case of “LOUIS 
DREYFUS COMMODITIES SUISEE supra which has held that: 
8. 
It is clear upon a reading of section 7 above 
that the recognition and enforcement of a foreign 
arbitral award shall not be refused except in terms of 
Article V of the Convention. It follows ineluctably that 
ordinarily the court will grant recognition and 
enforcement to a foreign arbitral award and any 
refusal is hedged in by the mandate of Article V of the 
Convention which forms part of the Act, 2011. This is 
the intention of the legislature and encapsulates what 
has been described as the underlying theme of the 
Convention which “can be said to have a pro-
enforcement bias and a strong case can be made out 
that the grounds under Article V are to be applied

Sections 6 and 7 of the Act, 2011 are the pivot 
around which the entire Act, 2011 revolves. These 
provisions direct themselves to the recognition and 
enforcement of the award and not the arbitration 
agreement. This is the crucial aspect which needs to be 
hammered in. The enumeration made in section 7 
captures the entire intention of the legislature. This 
enumeration will be kept in view by the court and take 
precedence over any other construction sought to be 
put on the scheme of the Act, 2011 or on the basis of 
the New York Convention which is appended as a 
schedule. The schedule will have relevance so far as it 
is referred to in the primary enactment itself. The 
ineluctable inference upon reading of section 7 is that 
the only grounds of refusal for recognition and 
enforcement of the award shall be those given in 
Article V of the Convention and no other. By necessary 
corollary, therefore, any challenge premised on Article 
II read with Article IV stand ousted. Sections 6 and 7 of 
the Act, 2011, when read in combination, oblige the 
court to recognize and enforce an award unless it finds 
the award to run foul of Article V of the Convention”.

To conclude this matter, this Court by relying on the judgment 
of Supreme Court of Pakistan cited in “Orient Power Company 
(Private) Limited (supra) whereby it has categorically held that “it is 
imperative that, Pakistan is one of the countries that have yet to 
develop jurisprudence on international commercial arbitration, and 
we must be cautious, and ought to adopt standards of practice in line 
with the international community. There is also a need to develop 
best standing practices for our own courts, which are seeing a rise in 
cases pertaining to international commercial arbitration; therefore, 
there is an utmost need to deliver precedent that is consistent and 
does not open floodgates to frivolous litigation. Indeed, the very 
purpose of parties going to arbitration is the (relatively) speedy 
settlement of disputes, which ought not to be impeded by a party 
resorting to litigation once an award is rendered.”. Accordingly, the 
Court finds that all requirements for the enforcement of the “Final 
Award” have been satisfied. The “Application”, is therefore, allowed 
and there will be an order as follows:

which shall be executed as decree of this Court. 
3)

4) 
In terms of Order XXI, Rule 10 of the Code of 
Civil Procedure, 1908 (C.P.C.) this Application 
is converted into execution proceedings.
