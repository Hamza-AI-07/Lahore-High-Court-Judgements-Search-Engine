AHMAD NADEEM ARSHAD-J. This Civil Revision is 
directed against the judgments and decrees of learned Courts below, 
whereby, the petitioners’ suit for recovery of possession through pre-
emption was dismissed, concurrently. 
2. 
 
Facts in brevity are that the plaintiffs/petitioners 
(hereinafter referred to as the petitioners) instituted a suit for 
recovery of possession through pre-emption on 07.03.1992 and pre-
empted the sale executed through registered sale deed No.73/1 dated 
14.01.1992, whereby, Muhammad Hanif son of Haji Shah 
Muhammad sold his land measuring 110 kanals to respondent No.1 
namely Atta Ullah son of Rehmat Ullah for a consideration of 
Rs.1,47,500/-. The petitioners pleaded in their plaint that they came 
to know about the sale on 13.02.1992 and announced to exercise their 

Civil Revision No.1200 of 2002.                                                                                  -2- 
 
right of pre-emption then and there in presence of witnesses, in this 
way they performed Talb-i-Muwathibat; that thereafter they sent 
notices of Talb-i-Ishhad dated 19.02.1992 to respondent No.1 and 
performed Talb-i-Ishhad; that they have superior rights qua 
respondent No.1 as they are Shafi Sharik, Shafi Khalit and Shafi Jar. 
The petitioners also impleaded in their suit Mst. Bhagan, Machia and 
Aziz-ur-Rehman, the rival pre-emptors as defendants No.2 to 4. The 
suit was resisted by the respondents/defendants through filing their 
separate contested written statements. Contention of respondent No.1 is 
that the suit land was originally owned by Muhammad Hanif who 
agreed to sell this land through an agreement to sell but later on he 
backed out and for cancellation of the said agreement, he instituted a 
suit for declaration, whereas he (respondent No.1) also instituted a suit 
for specific performance against said Muhammad Hanif; that his suit 
was dismissed whereas suit of Muhammad Hanif was decreed; that 
against said judgments and decrees two separate appeals were preferred 
which were allowed and suit of Muhammad Hanif was dismissed, 
whereas, his suit for specific performance was decreed and in 
consequence to said decree, registered sale deed dated 14.01.1992 was 
executed in his favour; that the petitioners were well aware regarding 
said sale from the day first when agreement to sell was executed 
between Muhammad Hanif and him, hence, they have no right of      
pre-emption and prayed for dismissal of the suit.  The defendants No.2 
& 3 as well as defendant No.4 filed their separate contested written 
statements. The learned trial Court, in the light of divergent pleadings of 
the parties, framed necessary issues and invited the parties to produce 
their respective evidence. After recording evidence of the parties, pro 

Civil Revision No.1200 of 2002.                                                                                  -3- 
 
and contra, oral as well as documentary, dismissed the suit vide 
judgment and decree dated 09.12.2000. Feeling aggrieved, the 
petitioners preferred an appeal which was dismissed by the learned 
appellate Court vide judgment and decree dated 23.07.2002. Being dis-
satisfied, they approached this Court through instant Civil Revision. 
3. 
 
No one appeared on behalf of the respondents despite 
repeated calls; hence, they are proceeded against ex-parte. 
4. 
 
I have heard learned counsel for the petitioners as well as 
applicants of C.M. No.2827 of 2021 at full length and perused the 
record with their able assistance. 
5. 
 
During the pendency of this Civil Revision, a compromise 
has been effected between the petitioners as well as respondent No.1 
and as a consequence, petitioners No.1,2 (B,C,D) and petitioners No.3,4 
& 5 withdrew the Civil Revision to their extent, however, the revision 
petition to the extent of petitioners No.2-A and 6 to 10 have been 
allowed and, resultantly, the judgment and decree of learned Courts 
below to their extent were set-aside and their suit had been decreed to 
their extent vide judgment and decree dated 27.05.2015. Said judgment 
and decree was assailed by the subsequent transferees through moving 
an application under Section 12(2) C.P.C., which was allowed by this 
Court vide judgment dated 17.06.2021, resultantly the judgment and 
decree dated 27.05.2015 was set aside and the revision petition was 
restored to its original number.  
6. 
 
After revival of the revision petition, the subsequent 
transferees moved an application i.e. C.M. No.2827 of 2021 under 
Order 1 Rule 10 read with Section 151 C.P.C., for their impleadment as 

Civil Revision No.1200 of 2002.                                                                                  -4- 
 
respondents in the titled Civil Revision. Said application is decided 
separately.  
7. 
 
To prove the suit for possession through pre-emption, it 
is imperative for the pre-emptor to prove performance of requisite 
talbs through cogent, reliable and confidence inspiring evidence, in 
accordance with law. Talbs as enumerated in Section 13 of the 
Punjab Pre-emption Act X of 1991 being essential for claiming right 
of pre-emption, strict proof for observance thereof would be 
necessary. In case of failure, the pre-emptor would be legally 
debarred. Performance of requisite talbs in other words is a sine qua 
non for decree of pre-emption suit. The august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the case titled as “Ch. Riaz Ahmad Vs. Munir Sultam Malik” 
(2022 SCMR 667) described the criteria to get a decree of pre-emption 
in the following terms:- 
“To succeed in a suit for pre-emption the first and for most 
condition is that plaintiff has to plead that before filing of suit he 
has fulfilled the requirements of Talbs and thereafter he has to 
prove the performance of Talb-i-Muwathibat and Talb-i-Ishhad. 
For proving Talb-i-Muwathibat needless to observe that there 
must be specific time, date and place of knowledge pleaded in the 
plaint as well as in the notice of Talb-i-Ishhad and thereafter 
plaintiff is required to prove the same by proving the gaining of 
knowledge at specific place, time and date and thereafter sending 
of notice attested by two truthful witnesses through registered post 
acknowledgement due where the postal facilities are available 
and thereafter to prove the delivery of notice to the addressee-
vendee-defendant or its refusal by producing a postman in the 
court while producing evidence to prove the above mentioned 
pleadings.” 
 
8. 
 
It is matter of record that predecessor of petitioners No.6 
to 10 namely Muhammad Hanif was vendor of the suit property who 
agreed to sell the same to respondent No.1 through an agreement to sell. 
However, he denied this fact and instituted a suit for cancellation of the 
said agreement to sell, whereas respondent No.1 instituted suit for 

Civil Revision No.1200 of 2002.                                                                                  -5- 
 
specific performance of the said agreement to sell. Although the learned 
trial Court decreed the suit of Muhammad Hanif and dismissed the suit 
of respondent No.1 but the learned appellate Court reversed the findings 
and dismissed the suit of Muhammad Hanif and decreed the suit of 
respondent No.1. Said Muhammad Hanif challenged the judgment and 
decree of learned appellate Court through filing Regular Second Appeal 
(R.S.A.No.58 of 1990), which was dismissed by this Court on 
11.12.1990 and CPLA No.24/L to 27/L of 1991 were dismissed by the 
august Supreme Court of Pakistan on 15.04.1991. Respondent No.1 
filed an execution petition for the satisfaction of the decree and the 
learned Executing Court got executed the registered sale deed No.73/1 
on 14.01.1992 (Exh.P-7). Petitioners No.6 to 10 are legal heirs of said 
Muhammad Hanif, whereas, petitioner No.1 namely Muhammad Anwar 
appeared as a witness in support of said Muhammad Hanif in his suit 
for declartion as he admitted said fact during cross-examination while 
recoding his statement as PW-4. In presence of said facts it is 
unbelievable that the petitioners came to know the factum of sale first 
time on 13.02.1992. It appears that they concocted the story of Talb-i-
Muwathibat in order to strengthen their case.  
9. 
 
The learned trial Court with regard to Talbs framed issue 
No.2 in the following words: - 
 
“Whether the plaintiffs have fulfilled the pre-requisite Talbs? 
OPP. 
 
And its burden of proof was placed upon the petitioners. The 
learned Courts below concurrently declared that the petitioners failed to 
fulfil the requisite Talbs in accordance with law.  

Civil Revision No.1200 of 2002.                                                                                  -6- 
 
10. 
 
Perusal of record it appears that the plaint is silent with 
regard to the name of the informer from whom they gained the 
knowledge of sale and time and place of Talb-i-Muwathibat as they did 
not specifically mentioned that at what time and place they gained the 
knowledge of the sale of pre-empted land. Relevant Para No.3 is as 
under:-

 11. 
 
It was not mentioned in the plaint as to who informed the 
pre-emptors about sale for the first time. Notices of Talb-i-Ishhad 
(Exh.P-1 to Exh.P-3) are also silent about the existence or otherwise of 
Muhammad Siddique as informer. This Muhammad Siddique, for the 
first time, while recording his statement as PW-1 introduced himself as 
informer. Petitioner No.1 namely Muhammad Anwar while appearing 
as PW-4 also made statement that one Muhammad Siddique arrived at 
their Dera and told that he has learnt from the Halqa Patwari that Atta 
Ullah has purchased the suit land. This improvement was made only to 
strengthen the case but failed to consider that no person can be allowed 
to prove his case beyond the scope of his pleadings. During cross-
examination petitioner No.1 Muhammad Anwar admitted that he is 
neighbour of Muhammad Hanif and was also appeared as witness in his 
suit for cancellation of agreement to sell. In this way, an inference can 
safely be drawn that when the suit was decreed in favour of respondent 
No.1 he was fully aware of this fact apart from the reality that he lived 
in the neighbourhood of Muhammad Hanif, the vendor of suit property. 

Civil Revision No.1200 of 2002.                                                                                  -7- 
 
They have common place of sitting and he was very good relations with 
him. It looks very strange that he got the factum of registered sale deed 
from a third person i.e. Muhammad Siddique (PW-1) who told him 
allegedly on 13.02.1992 after about one month of sale.  
12. 
 
The Talb-i-Muwathibt literally means immediate demand, 
that is commonly known as jumping demand and foundation of claim of 
pre-emption rested on making an immediate declaration of intention to 
assert one’s right and if the same is not done that would be fatal for 
whole claim of pre-emption and making of valid demands namely the 
Talb-i-Muwathibat and Talb-i-Ishhad, the condition precedent to 
exercise of the right of pre-emption. For proving Talb-i-Muwathibat 
the plaintiffs are required to state exact date, time and place of 
gaining knowledge because without proving the specific time, date 
and place of knowledge, the plaintiffs cannot prove jumping demand. 
When petitioners prove that on such date at such specific time and 
place they gained knowledge only then they could prove that they 
announced their intention forthwith to file the suit for pre-emption 
which is called jumping demand.  
13. 
 
It is evident from scanning of Para No.3 of the plaint that 
the petitioners neither mentioned the time nor place of alleged 
knowledge of sale and simply asserted that on acquiring knowledge of 
sale, they made announcement of their right of pre-emption. It is 
mandatory for the pre-emptor to mention the date, time and place. 
Notices of Talb-i-Ishhad (Exh.P-1 to Exh.P-3) are also silent with 
regard to date time, place of Talb-i-Muwathibat. 
 
From scanning of evidence it appears that Muhammad Siddique 
while recording his statement as P.W-1 introduced time of Talb-i-

Civil Revision No.1200 of 2002.                                                                                  -8- 
 
Muwathibat as 4:00 P.M., without describing the place, whereas, P.W-3 
Ghulam Muhammad described it as “Degar-Wela” and at the “Bhani” 
of Muhammad Anwar. Petitioner Muhammad Anwar in his statement as 
P.W-4 deposed that Siddique came at their “Dera” at 4’O clock. The 
petitioners made these improvements in their evidence beyond their 
pleadings.  
14. 
 
It is settled principle of law that parties are required to lead 
evidence in consonance with their pleadings and no evidence beyond 
the pleadings is permissible and even if it has been led by a party, the 
Court shall exclude or ignore the same from consideration. Reliance in 
this regard can be placed upon “MUHAMMAD TARIQ and others 
versus Mst. SHAMSA TANVEER and others” (PLD 2011 Supreme 
Court 151) wherein it is held as under:- 
“It is settled law that in civil litigation, a party thereto has to set 
out its/his case in the pleadings especially which relates to the 
facts and in the absence thereof no plead can be allowed to be 
raised, agitated and set forth at a later stage, as such shall be 
beyond the scope thereto and impermissible as per law.” 
 
 
The same view was further elaborated in a recent judgment of 
august Supreme Court of Pakistan in case titled “MUHAMMAD 
GHAFFAR (DECEASED) through LRs and others versus. ARIF 
MUHAMMAD” (2023 SCMR 344) wherein it is held as under: - 
“Needless to observe that a party can only prove the case 
pleaded by it. The rule of secundum allegata et probates, not 
only excludes the element of surprise, but also precludes the 
party from proving what has not been alleged or pleaded. This 
Court, in the cases of “Government of West Pakistan (Now 
Punjab) through Collector, Bahawalpur v. Hail Muhammad” 
(PLD 1976 SC 469), “Messrs Chaudhary Brothers Ltd., Sialkot 
v. The Jaranwala Central Co-operative Bank Ltd, Jaranawala” 
(1968 SCMR 804), "Binymeen and 3 others v. Chaudhary 
Hakim and another” (1996 SCMR 336) and “Major (Retd.) 
Barkat Ali and others v. Qaim Din and others” (2006 SCMR 
562), held that no party can be allowed to lead evidence on a 
fact which has not been specifically pleaded nor can any 
evidence be looked into which is outside the scope of 
pleadings.” 

Civil Revision No.1200 of 2002.                                                                                  -9- 
 
 
15. 
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan with regard to the 
moot point that plaint should contain date, time and place of Talb-i-
Muwathibat in a case “Mian PIR MUHAMMAD and another versus 
FAQIR MUHAMMAD through L.Rs. and others” (PLD 2007 Supreme 
Court 302) held as under: - 
“It is observed that great emphasis and importance is to be given 
to this word in making of Talb-i-Muwathibat and it is necessary 
that as soon as the pre-emptor acquired knowledge of the sale of 
pre-empted property he should make immediate demand for his 
desire and intention to assert his right of pre-emption without the 
slightest loss of time. According to the dispensation which has 
been reproduced hereinabove after performing Talb-i-Muwathibat, 
in terms of section 13(2) of the Act, the pre-emptor has another 
legal obligation to perform i.e. making of Talb-i-Ishhad as soon as 
possible after making Talb-i-Muwathibat but not later than two 
weeks from the date of knowledge of performing Talb-i-
Muwathibat, therefore, the question can conveniently be answered 
by hold that to give full effect to the provisions of subsection (2) 
and (3) of section 13 of the Act, it would be mandatory to mention 
in the plaint date, place and time of performance of Talb-i-
Muwathibat because from such date, the time provided by the 
statue i.e. 14 days under subsection (3) of section 13 of the Act 
shall be calculated. Supposing that there is no mention of the date, 
place and time of Talb-i-Muwathibat then it would be very difficult 
to give effect fully to subsection (3) of section 13 of the Act, and 
there is every possibility that instead of allowing the letter of law 
to remain in force fully the pre-emptor may attempt to get a 
latitude by claiming any date of performance of Talb-i-Muwathibat 
in his statement in Court and then on the basis of the would try to 
justify the delay if any, occurring in the performance of Talb-i-
Ishhad. It is now a well-settled law that performance of both these 
Talbs successfully is sine qua non for getting a decree in a pre-
emption suit. It may be argued that as the law has not specified 
about the timing then how it would be necessary to declare that the 
mentioning of the time is also necessary. In this behalf it is to be 
noted that connotation of Talb-i-Muwathibat in its real perspective 
reveals that it is a demand which is known as jumping demand and 
is to be performed immediately on coming to know of sale then to 
determine whether it has been made immediately, mentioning of 
the time would be strictly in consonance with the provisions of 
section 13 of the Act.” 
Further held as under: - 
 
 To give full effect to the provisions of subsections(2) and (3) of 
section 13 of the Act, it would be mandatory to mention in the 
plaint date, place and time of performance of Talb-i-Muwathibat 
because from such date, the time provided by the statute i.e. 14 
days under subsection (3) of section 13 of the Act shall be 
calculated”. 
“A plaint wherein the date, place and time of Talb-i-Muwathibat 
and date of issuing the notice of performance of Talb-i-Ishhad in 

Civil Revision No.1200 of 2002.                                                                                  -10- 
 
terms of section 13 of the Act is not provided it would be fatal for 
the pre-emption suit.” 
 
 
The said view was followed in “Sardar Muhammad Nawaz V. 
Mst. Firdous Begum” (2008 SCMR 404), “Mst. Bashiran Begum V. 
Nazar Hussain and another” (PLD 2008 SC 559) and it was also 
reiterated in “JAMSHED KHAN versus MUHAMMAD SAEED and 
others” (2010 SCMR 1796) wherein it was held as under: - 
“It is by now well settled that no-mentioning the place, date 
and time of Talb-i-Muwathibat and date of issuing the 
notice of Talib-i-Ishhad, in terms of section 13 of the Pre-
emption Act, is fatal towards maintainability of a suit for 
pre-emption.”  
 
16. 
 
Perusal of record reveals that the petitioners have failed 
to produce the Postman in order to prove sending of notice of Talb-i-
Ishhad to respondent No.1. It is held in the judgments reported as 
“MUHAMMAD BASHIR AND OTHERS V. ABBAS ALI SHAH” 
(2007 SCMR 1105) and “BASHIR AHMED V. GHULAM RASOOL” 
(2011 SCMR 762) by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan that 
where the plaintiff alleged performance of Talb-i-Ishhad by sending 
of notice of Talb-i-Ishhad through registered post and if the said fact 
is denied by the defendant then the plaintiff of such a suit must 
produce the postman to prove the delivery of the notice to the 
defendant or its refusal by the later as the case may be but in the 
instant case said mandatory requirement of production of postman 
was not fulfilled and the pre-requisite of notice of Talb-i-Ishhad was 
not complied with. The oral assertion, with regard to the performance 
of Talb-i-Ishhad, was not sufficient to get the relief as sought for and 
such default is fatal for the pre-emption suit on account of the failure 
of performance of Talb-i-Ishhad. Said dictum was followed in the 

Civil Revision No.1200 of 2002.                                                                                  -11- 
 
case titled “ALLAH DITTA through L.Rs. and others Versus 
MUHAMMAD ANAR” (2013 SCMR 866) wherein it was held as 
under:-  
“As regards, the issuance of notice of Talb-i-Ishhad is 
concerned, admittedly the postman has not been examined by 
the respondent-pre-emptor in terms of the law laid down in 
Muhammad Bashir and others v. Abbas Ali shah (2007 SCMR 
1105).”  
 
In another case titled “MANZOOR HUSSAIN (deceased) 
through L.Rs. Versus MISRI KHAN” (PLD 2020 Supreme Court 
749) it was held as under:- 
 “The postman was also not produced to establish the delivery of Talb-i-
Ishhad notice; this Court has repeatedly held the necessity to do this to 
establish delivery of such notice, including in Bashir Ahmed v Ghulam 
Rasool (2011 SCMR 762), Allah Ditta v Muhammad Anar (2013 SCMR 
866), Basharat Ali Khan v Muhammad Akbar (2017 SCMR 309) and 
Sultan v Noor Asghar (2020 SCMR 682). Therefore, there was nothing 
on record to establish that Talb-i-Ishhad notice was delivered to or 
received by the respondent, who had denied receiving it, and having 
failed to establish the delivery/receipt of the said notice the pre-emption 
suit could not succeed.” 
 
17. 
 
Perusal of record reveals that the application of Section 
13(3) of the Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1991, was not followed in true 
perspective and the petitioners are badly failed to prove due 
performance of Talbs in accordance with law. Judicial Concept Law 
is that provisions of Pre-emption Law must strictly to be complied 
with to attract its rigour and even the technicalities, therefore, are also 
relevant provisions of law. A person, who wishes to avail himself of 
a right under such law, is required to be vigilant and see that he 
complied with all the conditions imposed upon him. Hence, the 
learned Courts below rightly dismissed their suit concurrently.  
18. 
 
Learned counsel for the petitioners much emphasized 
that as during pendency of the instant revision petition the respondent 

Civil Revision No.1200 of 2002.                                                                                  -12- 
 
No.1 admitted their claim of pre-emption, therefore, they did not 
require to prove the Talbs in accordance with law.  
 
Firstly, respondent No.1 allegedly made the compromise 
through his special attorney when he had already transferred the suit 
property, therefore, admission made by him has no value. The 
respondent No.1 transferred the suit property through mutation of 
exchange No.5369 dated 16.09.2002 in the name of Machia which he 
conceded by moving an application (Civil Miscellaneous No.712-C 
of 2004) before this Court on 01.06.2004 whereby he himself 
acknowledged the sanction of said mutation of exchange. Meaning 
thereby that at the time of execution of special power of attorney 
dated 21.05.2015 on his behalf (who made compromise), at the time 
of moving Civil Miscellaneous No.1594-C of 2015 dated 23.05.2015 
(application for compromise) and at the time of decision of the 
revision petition dated 27.05.2015 on the basis of said compromise, 
respondent No.1 was not the owner of suit property and had not 
possessed any interest in the suit property, therefore, his admission or 
statement regarding acceptance of civil revision had no sanctity in the 
eye of law. According to Article 31 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 
1984 the statement made by the party was to constitute admission 
only if same was during the subsistence of interest. In this regard, 
reliance is placed upon “Saleem and another Vs. Malik Jalal ud Din 
and 7 others” (PLD 1982 SC 457) and “Muhammad Ilyas and others 
Vs. Muhammad Sharif and others” (2001 CLC 1194).  
 
Secondly, the pre-emptors have to prove the Talbs even if suit 
for pre-emption was not contested by the defendant. The august 

Civil Revision No.1200 of 2002.                                                                                  -13- 
 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case titled “Nawab Din through L.Rs 
Vs. Faqir Hussain” (2007 SCMR 401) held as under:- 
“Talb-i-Muwathibat is a personal act of prospective pre-emptor, 
whereby his actual right is activated. It is to be exercised at a time 
when no suit is yet filed, no notice of Talb-i-Ishhad is served, no 
Khasomat is preferred and when no defendant is in picture. Thus, 
the act of Talb-i-Muwathibat being pre-requisite to activate the 
very right of pre-emption and being subjective and spontaneous of 
the pre-emptor, has little to be waived by the defendant. The proof 
thereof is, therefore, necessary even if some suit for pre-emption 
is not contested by the defendant and even if the proceedings are 
ex parte. Any omission in this behalf, in the written statement, 
does not extend any benefit to the plaintiff/pre-emptor.” 
(underline for emphasis) 
  
19.  
         I have seen no illegality, irregularity and mis-reading or 
non-reading of evidence on the part of learned Courts below while 
passing the impugned judgments and decrees. There are concurrent 
findings of facts in the matter recorded by learned Courts below and 
the Courts below while passing the impugned judgments and decrees 
have considered every piece of evidence, oral as well as 
documentary, produced before them and nothing is shown to have 
been overlooked any part of the record from their judicious 
consideration. The findings of the learned Courts below on question 
of facts and law having based upon proper appreciation of oral as 
well as documentary evidence produced in the suit are not liable to be 
reviewed or substituted by this Court while exercising jurisdiction 
under section 115 of the CPC. In this regard, reliance is placed upon 
“Syed HUSNAIN NAQVI and others versus Mst. BEGUM ZAKARA 
CHATHA through LRs and others” (2015 SCMR 1081), “NOOR 
MUHAMMAD and others versus Mst. AZMAT-E-BIBI” (2012 
SCMR 1373), “Muhammad Akhtar versus Mst. Manna & 3 others” 
(2001 SCMR 1700), “Ghulam Muhammad & 3 others versus 

Civil Revision No.1200 of 2002.                                                                                  -14- 
 
Ghulam Ali” (2004 SCMR 1001), “Abdul Mateen and others versus 
Mustakhia” (2006 SCMR 50) and “Malik Muhammad Khaqan 
versus Trustees of the Port of Karachi (KPT) and another” (2008 
SCMR 428).

Epitome of above discussion is that the instant Civil 
Revision is without any merits; hence, the same is hereby dismissed 
with no order as to costs.
