Succinctly, the facts, as gleaned out from the

petitioner) 
moved 
an 
application 
before 
the 
Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue), Lahore 
with the averments that he being General Power of 
Attorney Holder coupled with agreement to sell, 
relating to landed property  falling in Mauza Rakh 
Khamba, Tehsil Raiwind Lahore, got approved 
development of Al-Hamra Town on land measuring 
917-Kanals & 5-Marlas & 100 Square feet; that after

Field Staff issued Fard Bay in favour of Saleem 
Murad (respondent No.5) who firstly managed 
execution of agreement to sell in his favour and then 
got a decree for Civil Court on the basis of said 
agreement to sell and finally attestation of mutation 
in his favour on the basis of said decree, which, being 
result of fraud, be reviewed. The said application was 
dismissed by the Deputy Commissioner/Collector,

2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits 
that the land mutated in favour of respondent No.5 
was mortgaged with LDA, thus, the same was not 
open for transfer in favour of private persons; that 
conversion of nature of land from agricultural to 
residential was incorporated in the Field Book by 
preparing Tatima Jat ( تتمہ  جات), thus, the same was 
not open for transfer while treating it as agricultural 
land; that respondent No.5 having connived with the 
previous owner, who became functus-officio after 
executing General Power of Attorney and agreement 
to sell in favour of the petitioner, managed to get 
transferred the land, subject matter of amenity plots 
in his favour and said mutation deserved to be 
reviewed but said important fact escaped notice of 
the authorities below; that bonafide claim of the 
petitioner is established from the fact that LDA 
Authorities themselves wrote to the revenue 
authorities for review of the mutation but no action 
was taken on said move just to enable respondent 
No.5 to complete fraudulent transaction in his favour;

mainly relied upon on a compromise between the 
petitioner, LDA, respondent No.5 and Al-Hamra 
Town to declare that the petitioner had no locus 
standi to institute proceedings before the fora below 
but said compromise could not be used to cover 
fraudulent transaction in favour of respondent No.5 
as promissory estoppel does not operate against a 
sham transaction; that the authorities below failed to 
appreciate that mutation is not document of title 
rather the same is sanctioned to update revenue 
record and same can be reviewed at any time but the 
revenue authorities failed to perform their obligation 
diligently; that though the referred compromise was 
signed by the Chief Engineer, LDA, on behalf of 
LDA but subsequently the said authority separated 
himself simply for the reason that transaction in 
favour of respondent No.5 was spurious in nature; 
that locus standi of the petitioner is also established 
from the fact that he sold more than 500 plots in 
capacity of sponsor and neither LDA nor respondent 
No.5 raised any objection against his status as 
sponsor, thus, the revenue authorities were not

Technical Approval has been granted in favour of

Al-Hamra Town but the same has been subjected to 
outcome of application filed by the petitioner for 
review of mutation which fact supports plea of the 
petitioner that transaction in favour of respondent

learned counsel has relied upon the cases reported as

I have heard learned counsel for the petitioner 
at considerable length and have also gone through the 
documents, annexed with this petition, as well as the 
case-law, cited at the bar. 
4. 
The mainstay of the arguments advanced by 
learned counsel for the petitioner is that since his 
client got approved development of Al-Hamra Town, 
after execution of agreement to sell coupled with 
General Power of Attorney by the owners, he was to 
be treated as sponsor. To appreciate the plea of the 
petitioner I have gone through the voluminous 
material on the file. While scanning the file, I have 
come across order, dated 17.08.2016, passed by this 
Court in C.M. No.2 of 2016 in Crl. Org. No.1020-W 
of 2016, which for convenience of reference is 
reproduced herein below: -

This is an application for disposal of main 
criminal original on the basis of compromise. 
 
2. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits 
that compromise has been effected between 
the parties, which has been placed on record 
as mark "A". Shahzad Najam Special Attorney 
and Sadaqt Ali, present in Court, verified the 
contents of the compromise. 
 
3. In this view of the matter, this C.M is 
allowed and main criminal original No. 1020-

A perusal of the afore-quoted order shows that the 
contempt petition, filed by the petitioner, was 
disposed of in terms of compromise which was taken 
on file as Mark-A. Further, the said compromise has 
been placed on file of this case as Annexure-H/2, 
relevant parts whereof read as under: -

both 
the 
aforementioned parties, having long 
spell of litigation (including W.P. 
No.729/2013), now compromise to 
resolve their controversies and, as 
such, the petitioner/party of the first 
part has been satisfied through 
payment of monetary recompense 
(Rs.1,20,000,000/-) by the party of the

aforementioned

The afore-quoted portion from the compromise, 
referred in the above order of this Court, renders it 
crystal clear that the petitioner surrendered his status 
as sponsor of Al-Hamra Town and accepted the 
status of respondent No.5 as new sponsor upon 
receipt of Rs.12 crore. In this view of the matter, no 
illegality has been committed by the fora below while 
impugning the locus standi of the petitioner to 
institute proceedings before different authorities in

While assisting the Court, learned counsel for 
the petitioner has put much emphasis on the fact that 
since the owners of the land, subject matter of Al-
Hamra Town, executed agreement to sell and General 
Power of Attorney simultaneously in favour of the 
petitioner, they could not deal with the said land 
subsequently especially when NOC was issued in 
favour of the petitioner. In this regard, I am of the 
view that it is not case of the petitioner that 
agreement to sell in his favour was ever translated 
into execution of sale deed, thus, he cannot claim 
himself to be owner of the subject land. There is no 
cavil with the fact that LDA used to issue NOC in 
favour of owner or sponsor for development of 
private housing scheme but said NOC does not 
denude the real owner to deal with his landed 
property according to his own whims. Moreover, 
conduct of the petitioner towards development work 
in Al-Hamra Town has been discussed in detail in the 
impugned orders inasmuch as after issuance of NOC

he disappeared from the scene for many years and 
upon complaints of the residents/allottees LDA 
decided to take over the scheme and got it developed 
through a new sponsor. If the petitioner was so 
curious about development of Al-Hamra Town he 
was supposed to be more vigilant. 
6. 
It is very ironical to note that on the one hand 
the petitioner opted to put a challenge to mutation 
attested in favour of respondent No.5 but on the other 
acquiesced with the transaction in favour of 
respondent No.5 by accepting him as a new sponsor 
of the scheme. The said fact has conspicuously been 
incorporated in clause (vi) of the terms of 
compromise, reproduced Supra. 
7. 
It is strange enough to note that during 
arguments learned counsel for the petitioner put 
much emphasis on the fact that firstly respondent 
No.5 succeeded to get executed agreement to sell 
from the owners of the land and then got decree from 
the Civil Court and on the basis of said decree he 
succeeded to get attestation of mutation, subject 
matter of this petition meaning thereby that mutation

revenue authorities have no power to review the 
mutation. There is no cavil with the fact that in 
routine revenue authorities have the jurisdiction to 
review a mutation but when the same is based upon 
decision of a court, same cannot be undone by the 
revenue authorities until and unless the verdict of the 
court is set aside. Reliance in this regard is placed on 
the case reported as Muhammad Nawaz and others v. 
Fateh Sher and others (2008 SCMR 1658), wherein 
the Apex Court of the country has inter-alia observed 
as under: -  
“10. There is another most important aspect 
of the case. The decrees are binding upon 
revenue officers and the decrees of the Civil 
Court cannot be upset or reversed by the 
Revenue Authorities, as these authorities have 
got no such power to sit upon the judgments 
and the decrees of the Civil Court as an 
appellate authority. These authorities are 
bound to implement these decrees in their 
Revenue Record, therefore, the learned 
Member Board of Revenue had exceeded in its 
power and authority, while rejecting the 
implementation of those decrees and making 
those decrees ineffective by his disputed order 
dated 18-12-1985.” 
 
8. 
While going through the decision of the 
Deputy Commissioner, Lahore, I have noted that

most of the persons, who executed General Power of

following portion from the aforesaid decision: - 
 
“vi) 
During course of hearing, it has been 
observed that most of the executants of 
General Power of Attorney who executed 
GPA in favour of Sadaqat Ali have since been 
expired. So, right of appellant is eliminated as 
GPA became infructuous and render-less in 
the eye of law.” 
 
It is well established by now that in the event of 
death of principle or attorney any instrument relating 
to delegation of powers in favour of a particular 
person stand redundant. Reliance in this regard is 
placed on the case reported as Mst. Hajyani Bar Bibi 
through L.R. v. Mrs. Rehana Afzal Ali Khan and 
others (PLD 2014 SC 794), wherein the preposition, 
under discussion, is responded in the following 
manner: - 
“12.*****and therefore in accordance with 
section 201 of the Contract Act the power of 
attorney will stand terminated on the death of 
the principal and therefore the sub-power of 
attorney issued by attorney Khairuddin is also 
invalid and of no legal effect as his power had 
already stood terminated on the death of the

Now taking up plea of the petitioner that since 
the Chief Engineer who signed the compromise on 
behalf of LDA disassociated himself through 
subsequent communication, is concerned, suffice it to 
note that since till date the petitioner has not assailed 
the validity of the compromise, referred Supra, 
before any forum he has no justification to challenge 
its veracity merely on the ground that one of its 
signatories has disassociated himself from the same. 
Moreover, 
since 
the 
above-referred 
Contempt 
Petition was disposed of by this Court in the light of 
referred compromise, same cannot be brushed aside 
at the whims of the petitioner who has miserably 
failed to establish his locus standi after signing the 
compromise according to which LDA took over the 
scheme and decided to get the development work 
completed through a new sponsor viz. respondent 
No.5. 
10. 
Insofar as the argument advanced by learned 
counsel for the petitioner that since 414-Kanals of 
land was mortgaged in favour of LDA the same was 
not open for transfer in favour of respondent No.5, I

am of the view that if anything was done affecting 
rights of LDA, then it was proper party to challenge 
the same. The recitals of the compromise, referred 
Supra, speaks loud about the fact that LDA, while 
acknowledging respondent No.5 as owner of 
considerable chunk of land in Al-Hamra Town, 
accepted him as new sponsor for completion of 
development work, thus, the petitioner being alien to 
the said proceedings had no cheeks to challenge the 
transaction in favour of respondent No.5. 
11. 
With a view to wriggle out of the dilemma of 
estoppel in view of the compromise, learned counsel 
has placed reliance on section 23 of the Contract Act, 
1872, to argue that since the consideration of the 
referred compromise was unlawful same being void 
in nature could not be used against the petitioner. To 
appreciate the plea of the learned counsel for the 
petitioner, I have gone through the compromise 
between the petitioner, LDA, respondent No.5 and 
Al-Hamra Town. According to the recitals of the said 
compromise, the petitioner failed to develop the 
scheme despite the fact that NOC in his favour was 
issued in the year 1980. When LDA, being the

decided to take over the same and get it developed 
through alternate sponsor. The question as to whether 
LDA can take over a private housing scheme 
especially when its owner/sponsor fails to develop it 
despite lapse of stipulated period came under 
discussion before the Apex Court of the country in 
Human Rights Case No.56878-P of 2010, reported as 
PLD 2011 SC 163 wherein it was inter-alia directed as 
under: - 
“4. The scheme in question had been 
launched by the said sponsor and sanctioned 
by the L.D.A. in the year 1982 i.e. almost 30 
years ago. In view of the grievances raised by 
the residents of the said scheme who had 
purchased plot therein on the strength of the 
sanctioning of the scheme by a responsible 
competent authority i.e. the L.D.A. and in 
view of the report of the L.D.A, itself 
regarding the provision of the requisite 
amenities including the building of roads, 
providing the electricity in the scheme, the 
provision for sewerage etc., and in view of the 
past conduct of the above mentioned sponsor 
spreading over a long period stretching over 
almost three decades, we do not consider it 
appropriate or advisable to trust the said 
sponsor any further. Consequently, the L.D.A. 
is allowed to undertake the provision of the 
amenities which the sponsor was legally 
obliged to provide to the residents of the said 
scheme which, needless to say, will have to be

If the fate of the compromise, referred Supra, is seen 
in the light of the afore-referred direction issued by 
the Apex Court of the country in almost identical 
case, there leaves no ambiguity that when LDA came 
to the conclusion that the petitioner failed to develop 
the scheme despite lapse of more than three decades, 
it decided to take over the same and get it developed 
through some other sponsor with mutual consent of 
the petitioner. In this backdrop, the assertion of 
learned 
counsel 
for 
the 
petitioner 
that 
the 
compromise was aimed at to support respondent 
No.5 does not carry any weightage. 
12. 
There is no cavil with the preposition that any 
contract offending against vested right of a party is 
not enforceable under the law but at the same time if 
a party is of the view that any contract would deprive 
him of vested right, it is bound to challenge the same 
in appropriate proceedings. Insofar as the case in 
hand is concerned, admittedly, till date the petitioner

Now coming to the case-law, cited by learned 
counsel for the petitioner, I am of the view that the 
same is inapplicable to the facts and circumstances of 
the present case inasmuch as in the case of Said 
Zaman Khan and others (Supra), the Apex Court of 
the country inter-alia held that any decision of a 
forum without proper jurisdiction is coram-non-
judice whereas in the case in hand when the 
petitioner himself acquiesced with the decision of 
LDA authorities to get control of the scheme and 
then to get it developed from the new sponsor, he 
was estopped to challenge the entitlement of 
respondent No.5 which has been acknowledged by 
LDA authorities. Insofar as the case of Rehmatullah 
and others (Supra), is concerned, in the said case it 
has been held by Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan 
that contents of mutation should be proved through 
evidence and the said case instead of lending any 
support to the petitioner goes against him inasmuch 
as if the petitioner was of the view that mutation in 
favour of respondent No.5 was attested against any

provision of the Land Revenue Act, 1967 he was 
supposed to approach the 
court of plenary 
jurisdiction for decision on the basis of evidence. 
Now coming to the cases of Executive District 
Officer (Education), Rawalpindi (Supra) and Zia-ud-
Din and others (Supra), I have observed that the 
Apex Court of the country in the said cases has held 
that if basic order is void then subsequent structure 
raised thereon has no justification to stand whereas in 
the instant case though learned counsel for the 
petitioner has addressed the Court at great length but 
has not been able to convince this Court about locus 
standi of the petitioner especially after signing the 
compromise which was made part of proceedings of 
contempt petition before this Court. Now taking up 
the case of Pakistan through Ministry of Finance 
Economic Affairs and another (Supra), I have noted 
that principles have been highlighted by the Apex 
Court of the country regarding applicability of 
doctrine of promissory estoppel whereas in the case 
in hand when the petitioner signed the compromise 
deed alongwith three others, after receiving amount 
of Rs.12 crore, he was estopped to challenge

As far as the case of Asad Ali Khan and others 
(Supra) is concerned, the same related to matter 
arising out of land acquisition, thus, the same has not 
even remotest connectivity with the preposition 
involved in the case in hand. In the last referred case 
of Province of Punjab through Secretary (Colonies), 
Board of Revenue, Punjab and others (Supra), this 
Court has held that fraud vitiates even solemn 
proceedings whereas in the instant case learned 
counsel representing the petitioner has miserably 
failed to establish fraud on the part of respondent 
No.5 and locus standi of the petitioner to file 
proceedings before different fora, thus, the said case 
also stands polls apart from the preposition involved 
in this petition.

For what has been noted above, I see no force 
in this petition which is hereby dismissed in limine.
