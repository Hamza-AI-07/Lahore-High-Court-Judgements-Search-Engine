Shahid Karim, J:-. This litigation has its provenance in a 
notice of resolution dated 08.03.2022 given by the joint 
opposition to table a vote of no confidence against Mr. 
Imran Khan, the then Prime Minister of Pakistan under 
clause 1 of Article 95 of the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (“The Constitution”) read 
with rule 37 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of 
Business in the National Assembly, 2007 (“the 2007 
Rules).  There is not much daylight between the parties 
on the basic facts which form the background of these 
three petitions (W.P No.8360 of 2023, W.P No.11705 
of 2023 and W.P No.11707 of 2023) which have 
commonality of questions of law regarding legality or 
otherwise of the resignations submitted by the 

W.P No.8360 of 2023 
 
2
petitioners and which were accepted by the Speaker 
National Assembly (“the Speaker”).  The notification 
in respect of the petitioners in W.P No.8360 of 2023 
was issued on 22.01.2023 and consequent upon that, the 
Election of Pakistan (ECP) issued a notification dated 
25.01.2023 de-notifying certain Members of National 
Assembly which are now the petitioners before this 
Court.  In W.P No.11705 of 2023 and W.P No.11707 of 
2023 the impugned notifications are dated 20.01.2023 
and 
17.01.2023 
respectively 
(“The 
Impugned 
Notifications”). 
2. 
The facts are refreshingly simple and are stated 
below: 
 On 10.04.2022 the No Confidence Motion was 
passed against the former Prime Minister Mr. 
Imran Khan.  On 11.04.2022 on the directions of 
the leaders of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) 
with Mr. Imran Khan as its Chairman, 123 
Members of the National Assembly including the 
petitioners submitted their resignations en bloc. 
On 13.04.2022 the then Acting Speaker accepted 
all 123 resignations under rule 43 of the 2007 
Rules.  The Deputy Speaker resigned on 
16.04.2022 and Raja Pervaiz Ashraf was elected 
as the Speaker National Assembly.  On the same 
date, the newly elected Speaker reviewed and 
reversed the decision of the Acting Speaker Mr. 

W.P No.8360 of 2023 
 
3
Qasim Suri and directed the National Assembly 
Secretariat to resubmit the cases of resignations 
for verification in the light of rulings of the 
superior courts and rule 43 of the 2007 Rules.  On 
30.05.2022 the petitioners were invited in the 
Chamber of Speaker to verify their resignations 
and it is admitted on all hands that the petitioners 
did not appear before the Speaker and the matter 
was left undecided.  There are intervening events 
which need not be adverted and which relates to 
resignations of 11 Members and their acceptance.  
Those Members are not before this Court.  While 
PTI as a party stuck to its stance that the 
resignations had lawfully been accepted by the 
Acting Speaker on 13.4.2022, it brought a 
constitutional petition W.P No.2892 of 2022 
before the Islamabad High Court.  This was 
brought by the Secretary General of PTI seeking 
setting aside of the order of Speaker National 
Assembly in reviewing the earlier decision of the 
Acting Speaker dated 13.4.2022.  The present 
petitioners were not petitioners before Islamabad 
High Court and so did not seek the relief which 
was being asked for by the Secretary General of 
the party and it is so contended by the learned 
counsel for the petitioners that this clearly 
showed that the petitioners had no intention of 

W.P No.8360 of 2023 
 
4
tendering resignations which was merely done on 
dictation of higher office bearers of the party.  In 
short, according to the petitioners, they were 
merely following the directions of the party 
leadership which had made a political decision 
for the resignations to be tendered and which 
would, in the opinion of the party leadership, 
have a spiral effect leading to elections and a 
fresh mandate from the people of Pakistan.  The 
constitutional petition was dismissed.  In doing 
so, the previous judgment of Islamabad High 
Court reported as Syed Zafar Ali Shah v. 
Federation 
of 
Pakistan 
through 
Secretary 
Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary 
Affairs, Government of Pakistan (PLD 2015 
Islamabad 156) was reiterated.  That judgment 
addressed 
the 
broader 
question 
regarding 
prerequisites for acceptance of a resignation by 
the Speaker National Assembly which we shall 
see is a well-worn path.  More significantly the 
Islamabad High Court refused to set aside the 
decision of the Speaker National Assembly in 
reviewing the earlier decision dated 13.4.2022 by 
the then Acting Speaker of the National 
Assembly.  Further the Islamabad High Court 
concluded that the then Acting Speaker National 
Assembly had, on 13.4.2022, accepted the 

W.P No.8360 of 2023 
 
5
resignations without following the principles laid 
down in the precedents of the superior courts as 
well as the 2007 Rules and thus the notification 
dated 13.4.2022 was issued in violation of the 
Constitution and those precedents.  The Speaker 
National Assembly has also accepted the 
judgment handed down by the Islamabad High 
Court and makes a reference to that judgment in 
the letters which were addressed to the petitioners 
calling upon them to visit the Chamber of the 
Speaker National Assembly and to verify their 
resignations individually.  On 15.12.2022 the 
Vice Chairman PTI, Shah Mehmood Qureshi 
wrote a letter to the Speaker calling upon him to 
accept the resignations of the Members of the 
National Assembly belonging to PTI.  A reply 
was sent by the Speaker National Assembly to the 
Vice 
Chairman 
PTI 
on 
22.12.2022 
(the 
Speaker’s Reply) and that reply had some 
significant features and is set out below: 
“I am directed to refer to the letter dated 15th December, 
2022 on the above subject and to state that verification of 
resignations is settled principle and indispensable 
according to the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of 
Business in the National Assembly, 2007, parliamentary 
practices, Ruling of the Chair and decisions of superior 
courts. In this regard Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure 
and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly, 2007 
is reproduced here for ready reference:- 
43. 
Resignation of seat. (1) A member under 
clause (1) of Article 64 may, by writing under his 
hand addressed to the Speaker, resign his seat.  
(2) 
If,- 
 
(a) 
A member hands over the letter of 
resignation to the Speaker personally and informs 

W.P No.8360 of 2023 
 
6
him that the resignation is voluntary and genuine 
and the Speaker has no information or knowledge to 
the contrary; or  
 
(b) 
The Speaker receives the letter of resignation 
by any other means and he, after such inquiry as he 
thinks fit, either himself or through the National 
Assembly Secretariat or through any other agency, 
is satisfied that the resignation is voluntary and 
genuine, the Speaker shall inform the Assembly of 
the resignation:  
 
Provided that if a member resigns his seat, when the 
Assembly is not in session, the Speaker shall direct 
that intimation of his resignation specifying the date 
of the resignation be given to every member 
immediately.  
 
(3) 
The Secretary shall, after the Speaker 
satisfies himself that the letter of resignation is 
voluntary and genuine, cause to be published in the 
Gazette a notification to the effect that the member 
has resigned his seat and forward a copy of the 
notification to the Election Commission for taking 
steps to fill the vacancy thus caused.  
(4). 
The date of resignation of a member shall be 
the date specified in writing by which he has 
resigned or if no date is specified therein the date of 
receipt of such writing by the Speaker.  
 
2. 
The Islamabad High Court vide judgment 2015 PLD 
156 and again in W.P. 2892/2022 upheld the decisions of 
the Speakers regarding not accepting resignations of 
Members of the National Assembly without verification 
thereof. The Supreme Court of Pakistan has seconded the 
said decision of the Islamablad High Court. It has been held 
that before accepting a resignation of a member the 
Speaker has to satisfy himself regarding genuineness and 
voluntary character of the resignation.  
3. 
The MNAs of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf who 
submitted their resignations on 11th April 2022 were invited 
in the Chamber of Honourable Speaker vide this Secretariat 
letters dated 30th May, 2022 for verification of their 
resignations from 6th to 10 June, 2022 in pursuance of 
paragraph (b) of sub-rule (2) of rule 43 of the Rules of 
Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National 
Assembly, 2007, but none of them came for verification of 
their resignations.  
4. 
In view of above, Honourable Speaker shall again 
invite these MNAs in his Chamber one by one for 
verification of their resignations in pursuance of paragraph 
(b) of sub-rule (2) of rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure and 
Conduct in the National Assembly, 2007, please.” 
 
 The first feature which strikes the reader is 
regarding the reliance of the Speaker National 
Assembly on rule 43 of the 2007 Rules as well as 
the judgment of the Islamabad High Court in 

W.P No.8360 of 2023 
 
7
Zafar Ali Shah.  In so relying the Speaker 
National Assembly was of the considered view 
that the resignations ought to be verified and for 
the purpose an inquiry was a sine qua non on the 
part of the Speaker National Assembly and which 
was yet to be held and for which the Members are 
required to be present before the Speaker 
National Assembly to individually and personally 
verify the tendering of resignations.  In paragraph 
4 of this reply sent on his behalf the Speaker 
National 
Assembly 
has 
indicated 
that 
“Honourable Speaker shall again invite these 
MNAs in his Chamber one by one for verification 
of their resignations in pursuance of paragraph 
(b) of sub-rule (2) of rule 43 of the Rules of 
Procedure and Conduct of Business in the 
National Assembly, 2007, please.”   
 It is the case of the petitioners in W.P No.8360 of 
2023 is that they had signified their intention to 
withdraw their resignations but without adverting 
to this aspect the impugned notification was 
issued by the Secretariat of the National 
Assembly on 22.01.2023.  In the other two 
petitions viz. W.P No.11705 of 2023 and W.P 
No.11707 of 2023 the petitioners do not contend 
that they withdrew their resignations prior to 
issuance of the impugned notifications.  This is 

W.P No.8360 of 2023 
 
8
the only distinction amongst these constitutional 
petitions. 
 During the interregnum, a delegation of PTI met 
with 
the 
Speaker 
National 
Assembly 
on 
29.12.2022 to impress upon the Speaker for 
individual verification of the resignations as a 
legal requirement and further to hammer in the 
importance of individual verification prior to 
acceptance of the resignations.  Apparently by 
this, PTI had decided in its political wisdom to 
join the National Assembly and required its 
Members to attend the proceedings of the 
National Assembly and to play its part as the 
Opposition in the House.  The petitioners in W.P 
No.8360 of 2023 contend that the letters of 
withdrawal of their resignations were sent to the 
Speaker National Assembly by the petitioners 
through an email at 8:30 a.m. on 23.01.2023 and 
the Secretary of the National Assembly was also 
informed that the petitioners had withdrawn their 
resignations.  This was also done through a 
WhatsApp message.  They also visited the 
Secretary 
of 
the 
National 
Assembly 
on 
23.01.2023 and filed an application regarding 
withdrawal of their resignations.  Despite this, the 
Speaker 
National 
Assembly 
accepted 
the 

W.P No.8360 of 2023 
 
9
resignations and consequently the impugned 
notification was issued by the Secretary. 
3. 
The facts adumbrated lead to the ineluctable 
conclusion that the Speaker National Assembly did not 
complete the inquiry regarding the tendering of 
resignations by the Members of PTI and no decision 
was made in this regard as none has been placed on 
record.  The only document from which this decision 
can be inferred is the impugned notification issued by 
the Secretariat of the National Assembly.  The further 
conclusion that can be drawn is that the Speaker 
National Assembly contrary to his own showing as 
reflected in various letters written to the Members as 
well as to the Vice Chairman PTI, proceeded to accept 
the resignations and directed the Secretary of the 
National Assembly to issue the impugned notifications.  
In the letter dated 30.05.2022 issued by the Addl. 
Secretary, National Assembly Secretariat to the 
individual members who are now the petitioners before 
this Court, it was stated that: 
“I am directed to refer to the letter dated 11-4-2022 
regarding your resignation from the seat of the National 
Assembly and to state that in pursuance of paragraph (b) of 
sub-rule (2) of rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure and 
Conduct of Business in the National Assembly, 2007, 
Honourable Speaker has desired to invite you in his 
Chamber for inquiry regarding voluntary character and 
genuineness of aforesaid resignation letter before its 
acceptance. 
 
2. 
You are, therefore, requested to call on Honourable 
Speaker on Tuesday, the 7th June, 2022 at 12:05 p.m in his 
Chamber, please.” 
 

W.P No.8360 of 2023 
 
10
4. 
Doubtless, by the above letter, Speaker National 
Assembly set in motion the process for an inquiry into 
the submission of resignations from individual members 
and relied upon rule 43 of the 2007 Rules in this regard.  
This was followed by reiteration of the same principle 
in the Speaker’s reply on 22.12.2022 to the Vice 
Chairman PTI which has already been set out above.  
This stated position of the Speaker National Assembly 
was firstly reflected in the act of reviewing the earlier 
notification dated 13.4.2022 by which the Acting 
Speaker of the National Assembly had accepted the 
resignations of 123 members of PTI.  In sum, there is 
absolutely no doubt as inferred from the documents 
explicated above that Speaker National Assembly was 
of the firm view that an inquiry into the genuineness of 
the resignations was a prerequisite and must be 
completed by the Speaker before a decision was reached 
with regard to the resignations.  The impugned 
notifications issued by the Secretariat of the National 
Assembly are contrary to the stated position of the 
Speaker National Assembly as also offend the 
precedents of the superior courts as well as the 
obligation cast upon the Speaker National Assembly in 
terms of paragraph (b) of sub-rule (2) of rule 43 of the 
2007 Rules. 

W.P No.8360 of 2023 
 
11
5. 
In resolving the controversy, Article 64 of the 
Constitution and rule 43 of the 2007 Rules would be 
engaged.  Article 64 of the Constitution provides that: 
“64. (1) A member of Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) may, by 
writing under his hand addressed to the Speaker or, as the 
case may be, the Chairman resign his seat, and thereupon 
his seat shall become vacant. 
 
(2) A House may declare the seat of a member vacant if, 
without leave of the House, he remains absent for forty 
consecutive days of its sittings.” 
 
6. 
At first blush, Article 64 is couched in simple terms 
and states that a member of Parliament may by writing 
under his hands addressed to the Speaker or to the 
Chairman of the Senate resign his seat.  There could not 
be a simpler procedure for an act of resignation by a 
member of the Parliament.  Yet in the peculiar political 
landscape of Pakistan, the superior courts have 
intervened to carve out rules which cast an obligation on 
the Speaker National Assembly to undertake an inquiry 
into the circumstances which led to the tendering of a 
resignation by a member of the Parliament who intends 
to resign his seat.  These rules and the prerequisites so 
enunciated by the superior courts are now cast on a 
tablet of stone and this aspect is not disputed by the 
Speaker National Assembly and is clearly discernable 
from the missive that were exchanged between the 
Speaker National Assembly and the members as well as 
with the PTI leadership. 
7. 
Rule 43 of the 2007 Rules provides that: 
“43. 
Resignation of seat. (1) A member under 
clause (1) of Article 64 may, by writing under his 
hand addressed to the Speaker, resign his seat.  

W.P No.8360 of 2023 
 
12
(2) 
If,- 
(a) 
A member hands over the letter of 
resignation to the Speaker personally and informs 
him that the resignation is voluntary and genuine 
and the Speaker has no information or knowledge to 
the contrary; or  
(b) 
The Speaker receives the letter of resignation 
by any other means and he, after such inquiry as he 
thinks fit, either himself or through the National 
Assembly Secretariat or through any other agency, 
is satisfied that the resignation is voluntary and 
genuine, the Speaker shall inform the Assembly of 
the resignation:  
Provided that if a member resigns his seat, when the 
Assembly is not in session, the Speaker shall direct 
that intimation of his resignation specifying the date 
of the resignation be given to every member 
immediately.  
 
(3) 
The Secretary shall, after the Speaker 
satisfies himself that the letter of resignation is 
voluntary and genuine, cause to be published in the 
Gazette a notification to the effect that the member 
has resigned his seat and forward a copy of the 
notification to the Election Commission for taking 
steps to fill the vacancy thus caused.  
(4). 
The date of resignation of a member shall be 
the date specified in writing by which he has 
resigned or if no date is specified therein the date of 
receipt of such writing by the Speaker.” 
 
8. 
Therefore, apart from the holding of the superior 
courts on this aspect, the Rules of Procedure and 
Conduct of Business in the National Assembly have 
also been enacted which oblige the Speaker National 
Assembly to conduct an inquiry to satisfy himself that a 
resignation is voluntary and genuine.  This process has 
to be set in motion upon receipt of the letter of 
resignation and only upon completion of this process 
shall the Speaker inform the Assembly of the 
resignation.  This obligation was sought to be performed 
by the Speaker National Assembly when it was 
suddenly terminated and the impugned notifications 
were issued by the Secretariat of the National 
Assembly.  The fact that the Speaker failed in his duty 

W.P No.8360 of 2023 
 
13
to comply with the terms of rule 43 is sufficient for the 
impugned notifications to be declared without lawful 
authority and of no legal effect. 
9. 
The courts, however, put further constraints upon 
the Speaker National Assembly in accepting or rejecting 
the resignation of a member of the Parliament.  These 
precedents have been handed down in the peculiar 
backdrop of the history of this country where 
resignations have been tendered or procured by the 
leadership of a political party sans independent 
decision-making on the part of an individual member.  
Not only that a reading of Article 64 would clearly show 
that its tenor refers to the resignation of an individual 
member.  In our political history however, there have 
been instances where en bloc tendering of resignations 
has been taking place and this has led the courts to 
formulate prior conditions to be fulfilled for their 
acceptance.   
10. Mirza Tahir Beg v. Syed Kausar Ali Shah and 
others (PLD 1976 Supreme Court 504) is a watershed 
case and has been followed in later judgments.  It will 
not be necessary to refer to each judgment which dealt 
with the issue of resignations.  I will only be referring to 
three major cases in which the question fell for 
determination.  The consideration of case law therefore 
starts with Mirza Tahir Beg. 

W.P No.8360 of 2023 
 
14
11. The facts which formed the background of the case 
and which led the Supreme Court to lay down the rules 
to be followed by the Speaker National Assembly are 
peculiar in nature and merely signify one of numerous 
instances in which resignations may be tendered and so 
enhances the importance of an inquiry to be conducted. 
12. The appellant Mirza Tahir Beg was the President of 
Lahore Branch of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and his 
resignation was received by the Speaker of the Punjab 
Legislative Assembly.  The resignation was accepted 
and a notification was duly issued.  A report was later 
on lodged by one Mirza Aziz Ullah who was the cousin 
of the appellant and it was stated that the appellant had 
been kidnapped earlier in the day and had been forced to 
resign his seat from the Provincial Assembly.  On 
17.2.1974, Mirza Tahir Beg sent telegram to the 
Speaker as well as the Prime Minister, the Governor and 
other authorities complaining that he had been made to 
sign his resignation and there was no intention on his 
part to resign his seat.  It was under these circumstances 
that the Supreme Court analyzed the question regarding 
validity of a resignation.  The following observations of 
the Supreme Court will be reproduced in extenso in 
order to appreciate the circumstances under which the 
holding of the Supreme Court was handed down: 
“In the instant case, the Speaker if I may say so with 
respect, treated the whole matter casually. Apart from the 
mechanical endorsement on the resignation brought to him 
by Syed Kausar Ali Shah, he remained insensitive to the 

W.P No.8360 of 2023 
 
15
extraordinary circumstances surrounding the resignation. 
The appellant is a resident of Lahore and in the normal 
course should have himself banded over his resignation to 
the Speaker, or should have dispatched it to the Speaker 
through ordinary mail. No question appear to have been 
asked from Syed Kausar Ali Shah as to bow be secured. the 
resignation and whether he was authorised to present it 
before the Speaker. Ordinarily, this should have raised 
curiosity if not suspicion in the mind of the Speaker. 
Needless to say that the Speaker in a parliamentary form of 
Government holds an office of highest distinction and has 
the sole responsibility cast on him of maintaining the 
prestige and the dignity of the House and each and every 
member composing the House. It is precisely for this reason 
that the Constitution has ordained that a resignation by a 
member is effective only when it is "addressed" to the 
Speaker: it was not intended to be an idle formality. To 
relinquish a parliamentary seat by resignation is a grave 
and:' a solemn act. By and large our political institutions 
are fashioned on the pattern of those obtaining in England 
and it is a settled principle of parliamentary law in England 
that a member of Parliament after he is duly chosen, cannot 
relinquish 
his 
seat 
by 
unilaterally 
resigning 
his 
membership. In order to evade this restriction a member 
who wishes to relinquish his seat, accepts office under the 
Crown which legally vacates his seat. This is enough to 
underline the gravity of 
the matter. (See May's 
Parliamentary Practice, 18th Edn., p. 45). 
The Speaker in the instant case laboured under the false 
motion that he need not look beyond the surface of the 
document presented to him by Syed Kausar Ali Shah, 
particularly when the appellant did not disown his 
signature on it. Unfortunately, this stand was endorsed by 
the High Court while dismissing Writ Petition No. 286/74 
moved by the appellant and in support of its decision, the 
High Court relied on this Court's judgment in A.K. Fazalul 
Qadir Chuudhry v. Shah Nawaz. In that case a member of 
the National Assembly addressed his resignation to the 
President instead of the Speaker. Like the appellant herein, 
he did not deny his signature on the resignation. Later, his 
resignation was forwarded by the President to the Speaker 
who acting on it declared the seat of the resigning member 
vacant resulting in a bye election. With reference to Article 
107 of the 1962 Constitution which is in pari materia with 
Article 64 of the present Constitution. But what the learned 
Judges missed was that it was held by this Court that the 
communication to the Speaker "is an essential ingredient of 
the application of Article 107 of the Constitution". The 
Court went on to observe in that case "that the transmission 
of the resignation to the Speaker in the absence of express 
authorisation by the member concerned was not valid" and 
therefore the notification by the Speaker declaring the 
vacancy and the resulting bye. election were set aside with 
one sweep as being without lawful authority. 
A fortiori in a case where the genuineness or validity, of 
resignation is challenged or ex facie is doubtful, the 
Speaker shall be under a duty to enquire; into the matter, 
before he allows the resignation to take effect. This is 
notwithstanding 
that 
the 
resignation 
takes 
effect 
automatically once it reaches the Speaker for it is implicit 

W.P No.8360 of 2023 
 
16
in the provision that the resignation is genuine and 
voluntary and was intended to reach the Speaker. This 
interpretation accords with the dictates of justice, equity 
and good conscience. The Courts, have always presumed 
the existence of such implicit power in the appropriate 
authority. See Craies on Statute Law, 6th Edition, page 111, 
under the caption "Implication". Where an enabling or 
remedial statute omit details, the treatise mentioned 
numerous cases in which omission relating to matters of 
procedure were supplied by the rule of liberal construction. 
Similarly, in Article 168 under the caption "Implications" in 
the Statutory Construction by Crawford, 1940, it is stated :- 
"The implications and intendments arising from the 
language of a statute are as much a part of it as if 
they had been expressed . . . . . . . . One may find 
numerous situations where statutes have extended 
by implication. Thus, a statutory grant of a power, 
privilege or property carries with it by implication 
everything necessary to its enjoyment or exercise." 
On the above analysis therefore, I have no doubt in my 
mind that Speaker had the right and duty under the 
Constitution to satisfy himself as to the, genuineness and the 
validity of the resignation by a member, before it is allowed 
to take effect. As a necessary corollary of that, the Speaker 
will have to make proper enquiry, if there appears anything 
tending to create any doubt with regard thereto. What will 
be the magnitude of the enquiry or whether, in a 
particular case, any such enquiry will at all be necessary, 
will depend on the facts of each case and it is not possible 
nor even desirable to lay down a criterion for general 
application. For example, if in the instant case, the 
appellant had himself appeared and presented his 
resignation to the Speaker and there was nothing to show 
that it was involuntary, then there is hardly any need for 
an enquiry. If on the other hand the resignation is not 
presented personally, but is sent through a massenger, as 
in the instant case, then Speaker will have to further 
satisfy himself that the transmission is by an authorized 
person. If for instance, a resignation, otherwise complete, 
but is stolen from the drawer of the member by another 
person who actually, presents it to the Speaker, it will not 
be ineffective for the purpose of Article 64. In the case of 
Syed Shah Nawaz noticed already, one of the defects which 
had rendered the resignation ineffective was that the then 
President who actually transmitted the resignation to the 
Speaker had no, authority from Syed Shah Nawaz to do so. 
“…The argument conveniently overlooks the fact that under 
the Constitution as interpreted in the earlier part of this 
judgment, the resignation could not have taken effect unless 
it was voluntary and intended to reach the Speaker in a 
manner chosen by the appellant himself. There is nothing 
whatever, to show that the Speaker had satisfied himself 
about either of two conditions, and therefore failed to do 
what he was required by law and the Constitution as 
interpreted above, to do. Thus there was no question of his 
becoming functus officio.”

13. The first principle that was laid down was that the 
resignation has to be submitted by the member himself 
and if that is not the case then the acceptance of the 
resignation by the Speaker in the absence of expressed 
authorization by the member concerned was not valid.  
That the Speaker was under a duty to inquire into the 
matter before he allows the resignation to take effect in 
order to gauge and determine the genuineness or 
validity of the resignation.  Further the Supreme Court 
held that there was no doubt that an inquiry was an 
essential part of the acceptance or rejection of the 
resignation and the magnitude of the inquiry was in the 
discretion of the Speaker and will depend on the facts of 
each case.  In case the member had himself appeared 
and presented his resignation, perhaps the Speaker was 
not required to draw an inference that the resignation 
was not voluntary and so there was hardly any need for 
an inquiry.  In case the resignation is not presented 
personally and is sent through a messenger, the Speaker 
is required to satisfy himself that the transmission is by 
an authorized person.  A very interesting incidence was 
also quoted by the Supreme Court which could be one 
of the myriad of instances that could take place in our 
political lives and which would tend to cast doubt on the 
validity and genuineness of a resignation.  Finally it was 
concluded by the Supreme Court that resignation could 
not take effect unless it was voluntary and intended to 

W.P No.8360 of 2023 
 
18
reach the Speaker in a manner chosen by the member of 
the Parliament himself.  In the present case the Speaker 
National Assembly himself harbored doubts regarding 
genuineness and validity of the resignation and did call 
upon the individual members to appear before him for 
verification.  Moreover, the resignations were not 
submitted by the members personally and it can be 
inferred that those members did not choose the manner 
in which the resignations were submitted to the Speaker 
National Assembly. 
14. Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif v. President of 
Pakistan (PLD 1993 Supreme Court 473) is a case 
whose facts have closer affinity to the facts in the 
present case.  One of the questions was regarding 
tendering of resignations by the members of the 
Parliament en bloc.  It was noted by the Supreme Court 
of Pakistan that the majority of resignations were 
obtained by persons of authority and power in political 
life and delivered to the President.  It was alleged by the 
learned counsel for the petitioners that the resignations 
had been collected by the leaders of the parties 
beforehand and utilized at the relevant time and 
delivered to the President.  The Supreme Court further 
noted that “there was an on-going practice among the 
political parties to obtain resignation of the members.  
In the absence of any effective and proper law for 
controlling horse-trading and floor-crossing, the 

W.P No.8360 of 2023 
 
19
political parties have adopted a method of controlling 
them by obtaining resignation from each member which 
may be utilized at their own convenience.”   In this 
respect, it was observed that: 
“Resignation is a voluntary act of a member or person, 
submitted with the intention to relinquish, relieve or quit that 
particular post or position and to vacate the same. It cannot be a 
two-way traffic or an act to use it for any purpose liked by any 
third person. The resignations obtained by any person politically 
or officially in authority or not from the members and delivery to 
a third party other than the person authorised to receive them, 
with the intention to achieve political gains and create a ground 
for dissolution of the Assembly can neither form basis for such 
action nor be justified by any principle of law, morality and 
ethics. 
 
15. Thus, there was no doubt in the estimation of the 
Supreme Court that a resignation was a voluntary act of 
a member submitted with the intention to relinquish and 
to resign his seat.  Further the resignations obtaining by 
a person politically or officially in authority from the 
members and delivered to a third party with intention to 
achieve political  gains and create a ground for 
dissolution of the Assembly can neither form basis for 
such an action nor such resignations would have any 
validity.  With regard to the duty cast upon the Speaker 
it was stated that: 
“To relinquish the parliamentary seat by resignation is a 
grave and a solemn act”. The letter of resignation should be 
signed by the member voluntarily and submitted personally 
to the Speaker or transmitted through duly authorized 
person for delivery to the Speaker. In A.K Fazlul Quader 
Chaudhry’s case the resignation of Shah Nawaz was 
rendered ineffective as it was transmitted by the President 
to the Speaker without any authority from him (Shah 
Nawaz). The Constitution ha thus cast onerous duty on the 
Speaker to make inquiry into the genuineness and voluntary 
nature of the resignation and also that it has come through 
an authorised person, if not submitted personally. The 
Speaker can neither refuse to discharge this duty nor can 
any authority bypass him. The solemnity and sanctity 
attached to the resignation by a member of the National 
Assembly shall be eroded if it is made in contravention of 
the provisions of the Constitution and the rules and 

W.P No.8360 of 2023 
 
20
furthermore if they are intended not to vacate the seat, but 
for any other purpose, ulterior, oblivious or clandestine. 
Such letters of resignation which do not have any validity or 
sanction under law can hardly be accepted muchless by a 
person of high position like the President to assess the 
confidence the members have in the Assembly and also to 
assess a situation whether the Government can be run in 
accordance with the Constitution. Even after tendering 
resignations of 88 persons the majority members were still 
in the Assembly.’ 
 
16. Let me emphasis the crucial observations that 
“furthermore if they are intended not to vacate the seat, 
but for any other purpose, ulterior, oblivions or 
clandestine”. These observations are so aptly applicable 
to the present cases which have uncanny similarity. The 
petitioners acted mechanically and reflexively on the 
command of party leaders with the object of forcing 
fresh elections. 
17. This was followed in another judgment reported as 
Abdul Razique Khan v. The Province of Sindh through 
Chief Secretary Govt. of Sindh Karachi and 3 others 
(PLD 1994 Supreme Court 79).  This case too related 
to the tendering of resignation of a member of Sindh 
Provincial Assembly who filed a petition in the High 
Court of Sindh stating that his resignation was not 
voluntary and thus the notification regarding his 
resignation was ultra vires.  While relying upon the 
earlier case of Mirza Tahir Beg, the Supreme Court had 
this to say: 
“9. The comments reproduced from the written statement of 
the Acting Speaker clearly show that the inquiry which was 
anticipated and which was withholding action on the 
resignations already submitted was with regard to 
determination whether these resignations were voluntary or 
genuine. Just by comparing the signatures and holding it to 
be of the appellant, it could not be deduced that the 

W.P No.8360 of 2023 
 
21
resignations were voluntary and genuine in the sense of 
being intended to be resignations. Therefore, the inquiry 
which was required, which was anticipated, which had, in 
any case to take place under the law never took place at the 
hands of the Acting Speaker. Anybody receiving the 
resignation has a duty to ascertain personally whether it is 
signed by the man resigning, whether it is voluntary and 
whether it is intended to act as a resignation. Unless all the 
three requirements of the resignation are satisfied it is 
dangerous in the political milieu in which we are living to 
give effect to such resignations. Mere prolonged absence of 
the person resigning, his non-appearance after notice or his 
absence from the proceedings even after notice could not 
prove these requirements. Unless these are positively 
proved, the resignations cannot be given effect to as 
resignations. The Rules of Procedure drawn up by the 
National Assembly in the matter of dealing with 
resignations are fairly exhaustive and consistent with the 
law laid down by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the 
cases of Mr. A.K. Fazalul Quader Chaudhury PLD 1966 SC 
105 and Mirza Tahir Beg PLD 1976 SC 504. The Provincial 
Assembly Procedure Rules have so far no .provision on the 
subject.” 
 
18. It can be seen from the observations set out above 
that the Supreme Court once again emphasized the need 
for verification of the resignations as to their voluntary 
nature and genuineness.  It was stated that it was the 
duty of the Speaker National Assembly to ascertain 
personally whether it was signed by the member who 
had resigned his seat, whether it was voluntary and 
whether it was intended to act as a resignation.  Unless 
three requirements of the resignation were satisfied, it 
was dangerous to set down a general rule that the 
resignation must be accepted once it is received by 
Speaker National Assembly without more.  None of 
these requirements of the resignations was fulfilled by 
the Speaker National Assembly while accepting the 
resignations of the petitioners.  At the time when the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan decided Abdul Razique 
Khan, and it has been noted in the paragraph reproduced 

W.P No.8360 of 2023 
 
22
above, there were no rules of procedure drawn up by the 
National Assembly in the matter regarding resignations.  
Now that the 2007 Rules have been enacted, the 
National Assembly has itself laid stress upon need for 
verification and for a proper inquiry to be conducted.   
19. Lastly, I may allude to the case of Zafar Ali Shah, 
to which a reference has been made above which 
robustly deals with the survey of case law on the issue 
regarding proper course to be adopted in accepting or 
rejecting a resignation.  That judgment also reiterated 
the conditions set down by the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in prior cases and takes stock of the peculiar 
political circumstances in which politics are played out 
in this country to hold that an inquiry by the Speaker 
National Assembly would serve a public purpose and 
strengthen the political process and constitutional 
democracy.  A common thread that permeates the 
precedents cited above is that the relinquishment of a 
parliamentary seat by a resignation is a grave and 
solemn act and must not be taken lightly and casually. 
Undoubtedly, the rights of the voters of the constituency 
are inextricably involved in the entire process.   
20. Another factor which would impact the impugned 
notifications and which ought to have been considered 
in the peculiar circumstances of the case was that 2023 
is an election year and very little time would intervene 
between acceptance of resignations and the holding of 

W.P No.8360 of 2023 
 
23
fresh elections.  Will it be sensible for huge funds to be 
expended on bye-elections to 123 National Assembly 
seats. There are circumstances of which judicial notice 
may be taken that the Federal Government suffers from 
severe financial and economic constraints and it would 
not be a proper exercise of discretion to accept the 
resignations at this juncture which would put enormous 
pressure on the public exchequer.  In the ultimate 
analysis the people of Pakistan would have to suffer on 
this account who would ultimately bear the economic 
brunt.  This may not have been a conclusive factor yet 
the Speaker National Assembly in his political wisdom 
could have abstained from accepting the resignations 
while taking into account this additional factor. 
21. The learned counsel for the Speaker raised a 
flanking rather than frontal attack on a challenge to the 
Speaker’s act. This may receive a short shrift. Firstly, 
the challenge is on the basis of 2007 rules, which are 
statutory, and their contravention by the Speaker. 
Secondly, this Court is only concerned with reviewing 
the process by which the decision was reached and not 
on the merits.  The latter is the exclusive domain of the 
Speaker.  Third, this question has been authoritatively 
determined in Muhammad Azhar Siddique v. FBR (PLD 
2012 SC 774). 
22. In view of the above, these petitions are allowed in 
the following terms: 

W.P No.8360 of 2023 
 
24
a. The impugned notifications challenged in these 
petitions and issued by the Secretariat of the 
National Assembly purportedly having been issued 
with the concurrence of the Speaker National 
Assembly are held to be without lawful authority 
and of no legal effect having been issued in 
contravention of the provisions of the Constitution, 
the 2007 Rules of the National Assembly and the 
judgments of the superior courts. 
b. As a consequence, the impugned notifications 
issued by the ECP are also set aside having been 
issued without lawful authority. 
c. The Speaker National Assembly shall complete the 
process of inquiry initiated by him.  He shall call 
upon the petitioners personally and for the purpose 
two opportunities would be provided to each 
petitioner to appear before the Speaker National 
Assembly for verification of their resignations.  A 
clear inference not only from a reading of rule 43 
of the 2007 Rules as well as the precedents of the 
superior courts is that while taking any decision the 
Speaker National Assembly shall pass an order 
which would reflect application of mind on each 
individual resignation with regard to which the 
inquiry is conducted by him.  It is also made clear 
that the petitioners may withdraw the resignations 
before 
the 
inquiry 
is 
concluded 
and 
this 

W.P No.8360 of 2023 
 
25
opportunity shall be afforded to each member by 
the Speaker National Assembly at the very outset.  
This is in consonance with the holding of 
Islamabad High Court in Syed Zafar Ali Shah, on 
which the Speaker has relied upon himself.  The 
petitioners my also signify their intent to retract / 
withdraw the resignations by informing the 
Secretary, 
National 
Assembly 
in 
writing 
whereupon the Secretary shall make arrangements 
for them to attend the sittings of the National 
Assembly as members.  Thereupon the resignations 
shall become ineffective.
