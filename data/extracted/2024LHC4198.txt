AHMAD NADEEM ARSHAD, J.  Through 
this 
Civil 
Revision filed u/s 115 of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, the 
petitioner has called in question the validity and legality of 
judgments/orders dated 14.03.2023 and 16.06.2023 of learned Courts 
below whereby her application for issuance of succession certificate 
was dismissed while directing respondent No.6 to pay the entire 
amount of the insurance policy to respondent No.2/nominee.  
2. 
Facts in brevity are that the petitioner filed an application for 
issuance of succession certificate by maintaining that her son namely 
Muhammad Jahangir Khan passed away on 05.04.2022, who in his 
lifetime had obtained an insurance policy worth Rs.10,00,000/- from 
the State Life Insurance Corporation of Pakistan, hence, she being 

C.R. No.44347 of 2023.  
2
mother (one of the legal heirs) of the deceased is entitled to inherit 
1/6th share out of the policy amount. Learned Trial Court, after taking 
its reply, dismissed the same vide order dated 14.03.2023 and 
directed respondent No.6 to pay the entire amount of the insurance 
policy to respondent No.2/wife of the deceased being 'nominee'. 
Feeling aggrieved, the petitioner preferred an appeal which also met 
the same fate and dismissed by the learned Appellate Court vide 
judgment/order dated 16.06.2023. Hence, this petition.  
3. 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and 
perused the record with their able assistance.  
4. 
It is matter of record that Muhammad Jahangir Khan died on 
05.04.2022 leaving behind mother namely Mst. Razia Begum 
(petitioner), widow namely Mst. Sana Mukhtar (respondent No.2), a 
daughter and two sons (respondents No.3 to 5). Admittedly, deceased 
Muhammad Jahangir Khan in his lifetime purchased an insurance 
policy from State Life Insurance Corporation of Pakistan wherein he 
nominated his wife (respondent No.2) as his nominee. The petitioner, 
by way of filing an application for issuance of succession certificate, 
claimed that being mother of the deceased she is entitled to inherit 
1/6th share of the insurance policy amount, whereas, respondent No.2 
denied her right on the ground that being nominee she is solely 
entitled to receive the whole insurance policy amount.  
5. 
The learned Courts below non-suited the petitioner on the 
ground that the amount of the Insurance Policy does not fall within 
the ambit of “Tarka” and said conclusion was drawn in the light of 

C.R. No.44347 of 2023.  
3
judgment of Hon‟ble Sindh High Court rendered in a case titled 
“MST. RABIA QAVI AND OTHERS V. MST. HINA QAVI KHAN 
AND OTHERS” (PLD 2020 Sindh 263) wherein, by considering the 
decision of the Federal Shariat Court in a case titled “MIRZA 
MUHAMMAD AMEEN, ETC. V. GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN” 
(PLD 1982 FSC 143) and decision of the Shariat Appellate Bench in 
a 
case 
titled 
“WAFAQI 
HAKOOMAT-E-PAKISTAN 
V. 
AWAMUNNAS” (PLD 1991 Supreme Court 731), concluded that 
amount of life insurance policy is not part of the „Tarka‟, therefore, 
not liable to be inherited to the legal heirs and only the nominee is 
entitled to receive the amount of said life insurance policy.  
6. 
The deeper dive into the documents and the grounds advanced 
by the learned counsel for the parties reveals that following questions 
need adjudication: 
(i) 
Whether the proceeds of Insurance Policy are to be 
treated as „Tarka‟? 
(ii) 
Whether the nominee can exclude all the legal heirs 
of the deceased insured person and the nomination 
itself operates as a gift or will?  
(iii) 
Whether the status of the nominee is only to collect 
the policy proceeds and distribute the same amongst 
the legal heirs.  
 
7. 
Before further discussion, it is better to understand the 
meaning of "nominee" in the light of renounced dictionaries. A 
"nominee" is typically defined as a person or entity designated to act 
on behalf of another, particularly in legal or financial matters. The 

C.R. No.44347 of 2023.  
4
nominee may hold assets for the benefit of the actual owner, 
indicating a fiduciary relationship.  
 
BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (11th Edition) has explained the 
word "nominee" as “a party who holds bare legal title for the benefit 
of others or who receives and distributes funds for the benefit of 
others”.  
 
OXFORD ADVANCED LEARNER‟S DICTIONARY has 
defined the word "nominee" as “a person who has been formally 
suggested for a job, a prize etc.  
 
The status of the nominee has been thrashed out by the august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the landmark judgment titled “MST. 
AMTAL HABIB AND OTHERS V. MST. MUSARAT PARVEEN AND 
OTHERS” (PLD 1974 SC 185) in the following manner: 
"The nomination merely confers a right to collect the money or 
to "receive the money". It does not operate either as a gift or as a 
will and, therefore, cannot deprive the others heirs of the 
nominator who may be entitled thereto under the law of 
succession applicable to the deceased. The nominee thus collects 
as a trustee for the benefit of all persons entitled to inherit from 
the deceased employee." 
 
This view was reiterated by the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in a case titled “MALIK SAFDAR ALI KHAN ANOTHER V. 
PUBLIC AT LARGE AND OTHERS” (2004 SCMR 1219).  
 
In another case titled “MST. AMEERAN KHATOON V. MST. 
SHAMIM AKHTAR AND OTHERS” (2005 SCMR 512), the august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan while relying upon the judgment of 

C.R. No.44347 of 2023.  
5
“WAFAQI HAKOOMAT-E-PAKISTAN (referred supra) wherein 
'Tarka' was defined, held as under: 
 “Applying above test on the facts of instant case we are 
persuaded to hold that deceased Muhammad Ayub was not 
entitled for the Benevolent Fund and, Group Insurance during his 
life time and on his death, such amounts shall be deemed to be 
owned by him. Thus they will devolve upon his legal heirs being 
his ' Tarka'. Therefore, petitioner would not be entitled exclusively 
to claim these amounts except to the extent of her entitlement as 
per Shariat with other legal heirs of the deceased as it has been 
held by this Court in the case of Mst. Amtul Habib and others v. 
Mst. Musarrat Parveen and others PLD 1974 SC 185.” 
 
 
A Division Bench of this Court, while dealing with the 
question of nomination in a case titled "POSTAL LIFE INSURANCE 
(PLI) AND OTHERS V. MUHAMMAD ISHAQUE BUTT" (2022 
CLD 309), observed as under: 
"The nomination by itself only confers right to collect the money 
but does not operate either as a gift or as a will, in view of the 
rule in "Mst. Amtul Habib and others v. Mst. Musarrat Parveen 
and others" (PLD 1974 SC 185), therefore, it cannot deprive the 
legal heirs of the nominator who are otherwise entitled to inherit 
the assets of deceased, under the law of succession applicable to 
the deceased. The respondent as nominee will be entitled to 
collect the amount of claim as trustee for the benefit of all the 
legal heirs entitled to inherit from the deceased nominator and 
will be responsible for disbursement of the awarded claim with 
liquidated damages, in terms of judgment of the Insurance 
Tribunal which the respondent as trustee of the amount shall be 
legally obliged to disburse amongst the legal heirs of deceased." 
 
From the above said discussion, it has been safely concluded 
that the nomination merely confers a right to collect the money or to 
receive the money and it does not operate as a gift or as a will and, 
therefore, cannot deprive the legal heirs of the nominator who may 

C.R. No.44347 of 2023.  
6
be entitled thereto under the law of succession applicable to the 
deceased propositus. The nominee, thus collects as a trustee for the 
benefit of all persons entitled to inherit from the deceased propositus.   
8. 
The term “Tarka” has already been explained by the Federal 
Shariat Court and the Shariat Appellate Bench. The Federal Shariat 
Court in “Mirza Muhammad Ameen‟s Case” referred supra held as 
under: 
“This summing up is the crux of the matter. What is heritable is 
only that right which a person enjoys or had a right to enjoy 
during his lifetime till his death and this may include corporeal 
property incorporeal property whether partial or absolute, right to 
easement, debt including mortgage debt with right to remain in 
possession of property mortgaged, right to Diyyat and other 
compensation, right to recover debt or property by action 
(Chooses-in-action), right to possession of property sold till the 
payment by the purchaser of the purchase money and all other 
rights which are not strictly personal in the sense that they might 
abate with the death of the right-holder.” 
 
 
Whereas, 
Shariat 
Appellate 
Bench, 
in 
“WAFAQI 
HAKOOMAT-E-PAKISTAN‟s case referred supra, observed as under: 
"

Now the foremost question for determination is that whether 
the amount of Life Insurance Policy falls within the ambit of “Tarka” 
and liable to be distributed amongst the legal heirs of the deceased 
propositus or not? The status of the amount of Life Insurance Policy 
is not described in the insurance documents. However, Section 72 of 
the Insurance Ordinance, 2000, provides that the policy holder, when 
effecting the policy or at any time before the policy matures for 
payment, nominate the person or the persons as nominee to whom 
the money secured by the policy shall be paid in the event of the 
death of the insured person. For ready reference, said Section is 
reproduced as under: 
72. Nomination by policy holder.- (1) The holder of a policy of 
life insurance on his own life, may, when effecting the policy or at 
any time before the policy matures for payment, nominate the 
person or persons to whom the money secured by the policy shall 
be paid in the event of his death:  
Provided that where any nominee is a minor, it shall be lawful for 
the policy holder to appoint in the prescribed manner any person 
to receive the money secured by the policy in the event of his 
death during the minority of the nominee. 
 (2) Any such nomination in order to be effectual shall, unless it is 
incorporated in the text of the policy itself, be made by an 
endorsement on the policy communicated to the insurer and 
registered by him in the record relating to the policy and any such 
nomination may, at any time before the policy matures for 
payment, be cancelled or changed by an endorsement or a further 
endorsement or a will, as the case may be, but unless notice in 
writing of any such cancellation or change has been delivered to 
the insurer the insurer shall not be liable for any payment under 
the policy made bona fide by him to a nominee mentioned in the 
text of the policy or registered in records of the insurer.  

C.R. No.44347 of 2023.  
8
(3) The insurer shall furnish to the policy holder a written 
acknowledgment of having registered a nomination or a 
cancellation or change thereof.  
(4) A transfer or assignment of a policy made in accordance with 
section 71 shall automatically cancel a nomination: Provided that 
the assignment of a policy to the insurer who bears the risk on the 
policy at the time of the assignment in consideration of a loan 
granted by that insurer on the security of the policy within its 
surrender value, or its re-assignment on repayment of the loan 
shall not cancel a nomination, but shall affect the right of the 
nominee only to the extent of the insurer‟s interest in the policy. 
Provided further that the assignment of a policy to a party other 
than the insurer who bears the risk on the policy at the time of the 
assignment, in consideration of a loan granted by that person on 
the security of the policy within its surrender value shall not 
cancel a nomination but shall suspend it, to the extent of the 
interest of that person in the policy, until such time as the policy is 
re-assigned on repayment of the loan. 
(5) Where the policy matures for payment during the lifetime of 
the person whose life is insured or where the nominee or, if there 
are more nominees than one, all the nominees die before the 
policy matures for payment, the amount secured by the policy 
shall be payable to the policy holder or his heirs or legal 
representatives or the holder of a succession certificate, as the 
case may be.  
(6) Where the nominee or, if there are more nominees than one, a 
nominee or nominees, survive the person whose life is insured the 
amount secured by the policy shall be payable to such survivor or 
survivors.  
(7) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any policy of 
life insurance to which section 6 of the Married Women‟s 
Property Act, 1874 (III of 1874), applies or has at any time 
applied:  
Provided 
that 
where 
a 
nomination 
made 
before 
the 
commencement of this Ordinance, in favour of the wife of the 
person who has insured his life or of his wife and children or any 
of them, is expressed, whether or not on the face of the policy, as 

C.R. No.44347 of 2023.  
9
being made under this section, the said section 6 shall be deemed 
not to apply or not have applied to the policy. 
 
10. 
Admittedly, when a person secures Insurance Policy he makes 
certain payments from time to time as per the schedule from his 
pocket and on the maturity of Policy in his lifetime, he is entitled to 
receive the same. Moreover, as per sub-Section 02 of Section 72 of 
Ordinance ibid the Policy holder can change the nominee or cancel 
the nomination at any time before maturity of the policy. It is further 
provided in the sub-section 05 of Section 72 of the Ordinance ibid 
that in the event of death of the nominee or the nominees before the 
policy matures the amounts secured by the policy shall be payable to 
the legal heirs of the deceased policy holder or legal representatives, 
or the holder of a succession certificate, as the case may be. It is 
nowhere mentioned that after the death of nominee the amount 
would be disbursed amongst the legal heirs or legal representatives 
of the nominee. Hence, it clarifies that the nomination shall not 
operate as a gift or will because had the nomination been a gift or 
will, then after the death of the nominee the amount would devolve 
on the heirs of nominee rather than the heirs of policy holder.  
11. 
The Section 72 of the Ordinance ibid, authorizes and 
empowers the policy holder to nominate a person or persons to 
whom the money secured by the policy shall be paid in the event of 
his death, but this provision of law does not exclude the legal heirs to 
inherit the assets, including the policy proceed of the deceased 
according to the principle of Muhammadan Law, because the reasons 

C.R. No.44347 of 2023.  
10
is that there is a constitutional guarantee enunciated in the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, that no law 
can be made which is contrary to the injunctions of Quran and 
Sunnah. It is a Quranic injunction that the legal heirs of a Muslim 
deceased, will inherit their assets according to the principle of 
Muhammadan Law, therefore, for this reason the Superior Courts of 
the country finally held, that the nominee is only supposed to collect 
the policy proceeds and to disburse among the legal heirs and further 
the nominee in any case shall not exclude or deprive the legal heirs 
by the fruits of the policy. Reliance is placed upon the Insurance 
Tribunal case law cited as "MUHAMMAD UMAR V. IGI AND 
OTHERS" (2023 CLD 420).  
12. 
From the analysis of the above discussed legal provisions, it 
can be securely held that the Insurance Policy proceeds fall within 
the definition of 'Tarka' of the policy holder after his death.  
13. 
The concept of nominee is alien to Muslim Law, according to 
which the legal heirs are the only persons entitled to receive the 
property left by their predecessor and no Muslim heir can exclude 
the other heir on the ground that he is a nominee. It is an established 
principle of law that a nominee, if appointed, does not become the 
sole owner of the assets left by the deceased but he/she is only 
authorized to collect the amount or to hold the property of the 
deceased as an administrator and then to distribute the same amongst 
all the legal heirs. The nomination does not make the nominee as 
donee nor the nomination amounts to a gift, in the absence of 

C.R. No.44347 of 2023.  
11
delivery of possession of the property gifted. The nominee cannot 
claim as exclusive owner of the amount of the insurance policy. In 
the light of Muslim Law of Inheritance, all the legal heirs of the 
deceased are entitled to receive the property („Tarka‟) left by the 
deceased, according to their shares.  
14. 
In view of the above discussed circumstances, learned Courts 
below have erred in law while dismissing the succession petition of 
the petitioner. Learned Courts below have failed to properly 
appreciate the question involved in the lis. The judgments referred by 
the Courts below as well as learned counsel for the respondent are 
not applicable in the present case as this case relates to life insurance 
policy and the nominee was appointed by the nominator just to fulfill 
the legal requirement of Section 72 of the Insurance Ordinance, 2000. 
15. 
As an inevitable corollary of the above discussion, this 
petition is allowed. Consequently, impugned judgments of the Courts 
below are set-aside and the petitioner is held entitled to receive her 
due share out of the policy proceeds. Learned Trial Court is directed 
to issue the succession certificate forthwith as per Shari shares of all 
the legal heirs of deceased Muhammad Jahangir Khan.
