Raheel Kamran J:- In this petition under Article

the 
Constitution 
of 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Pakistan 
(‘Constitution’) as well as the connected petition i.e. W.P.No.49585 of 
2024, the petitioners (K&N’s Foods (Pvt.) Ltd and Fauji Foods 
Limited) have assailed notices dated 02.07.2024 and orders dated 
09.07.2024 issued by the Commissioner Inland Revenue, Zone-II, 
Lahore whereby exemption certificates for the period from 01.07.2024 
to 31.12.2024 issued in their favour were revoked.

2. 
The facts of the case, briefly, are that on 30.06.2024, K&N’s 
Foods (Pvt.) Ltd. (petitioner in this petition) was issued the exemption 
certificate for the period between 01.07.2024 to 31.12.2024 under 
section 153(4) of the Ordinance for the supply of goods without 
payment of tax under section 153(1)(a) of the Ordinance, which was 
proposed to be revoked vide impugned notice on the pretext of 
amendment substituting sub-section (4) of section 153 of the 
Ordinance through Finance Act, 2024 dated 30.06.2024 w.e.f. 
01.07.2024 allowing deduction of tax at reduced rates.  Likewise, 
exemption certificate for the period from 01.07.2024 to 31.12.2024 
was issued to Fauji Foods Ltd. (petitioner in connected W.P.No.49585 
of 2024) on 28.06.2024, which was proposed to be revoked through 
impugned notice dated 02.07.2024.  Consequently, vide impugned 
orders dated 09.07.2024, the exemption certificates issued in favour of 
the petitioners-companies were revoked, however, exemption 
certificates of reduced rate of 1% were ordered to be issued for the 
same period on filing of fresh application by the taxpayer. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners contends that the impugned 
notices and the impugned orders have been issued without lawful 
authority and the same are of no legal effect inasmuch as the 
amendment introduced in section 153(4) of the Ordinance through the 
Finance Act, 2024 has no retrospective effect or application to 
adversely affect the exemption certificates dated 30.06.2024 and 
28.06.2024 issued in favour of the petitioners.  They explain that the 
amendment in sub-section (4) of section 153 of the Ordinance was 
applicable with effect from 01.07.2024 and the same could not 
lawfully disturb exemption certificates issued to the petitioners prior to 
the said date.  He further contends that the petitioners-companies 
cannot be asked to pay more tax which is not due as they had already 
discharged their entire tax liability by paying the tax in advance from 
01.07.2024 to 31.12.2024.  According to them, section 153(4) of the 

3 
W.P No.43578 of 2024 
W.P No.49585 of 2024 
Ordinance is confiscatory, expropriatory and violative of Articles 10A, 
18, 23, 24 & 77 of the Constitution, therefore, impugned notices as 
well as the impugned orders are liable to be set aside. 
4. 
Conversely, learned Law Officers and learned counsel appearing 
on behalf of the respondents-FBR contend that the certificates of 
exemption have been issued for the tax year 2025 commencing from 
01.07.2024, therefore, the amended section 153(4) of the Ordinance 
was squarely applicable in the instant case.  They maintain that 
issuance of exemption certificates on 28.06.2024 or 30.06.2024 is in 
disregard of the law applicable with effect from 01.07.2024, therefore, 
of no legal effect and the impugned orders have been passed lawfully.  
They emphasize that plea of violation of the constitutional provisions 
is utterly misconceived for it does not explain how the constitutional 
guarantees have been violated through the amended section 153(4).  It 
is finally contended that the impugned orders have been passed to issue 
fresh certificates in accordance with law applicable for the relevant 
period and the same are unexceptionable, therefore, these petitions 
merit dismissal.    
5. 
Heard. 
6. 
Record reflects that the petitioners-companies in both the 
petitions submitted applications for issuance of exemption certificates 
against income tax deduction under section 153(1) of the Ordinance for 
the period between 01.07.2024 to 31.12.2024.  The advance tax 
liabilities assessed by the department were discharged by adjusting 
through available funds and exemption certificates were issued on 
30.06.2024 and 28.06.2024 respectively for the period between 
01.07.2024 to 31.12.2024.  Subsequently, after introduction of the 
amendment in sub-section (4) of section 153 of the Ordinance through 
Finance Act, 2024, the respondents-department issued notices on 
02.07.2024 requiring the petitioners-companies to explain why the 

4 
W.P No.43578 of 2024 
W.P No.49585 of 2024 
exemption certificates issued to them be not revoked and reduced rate 
certificates for the same period might not be issued.  Thereafter, vide 
orders dated 09.07.2024, exemption certificates issued in favour of the 
petitioners were revoked, entitling them for issuance of exemption 
certificates of reduced rate of 1% for the same period once fresh 
application is filed by the taxpayer.       
7. 
Prior to substitution through Finance Act, 2024, sub-section (4) 
of section 153 of the Ordinance was as under: - 
“(4) 
The Commissioner may, on application made by the 
recipient of a payment referred to in sub-section (1) and after 
making such inquiry as the Commissioner thinks fit, may allow in 
cases where tax deductible under sub-section (1) is [not minimum], 
by an order in writing , any person to make the payment,-- 
(a) 
without deduction of tax; or 
(b) 
deduction of tax at a reduced rate 
Provided that the Commissioner shall issue certificate for 
payment under clause (a) of sub-section (1) without deduction of tax 
within fifteen days of filing of application to a [company] if advance 
tax liability has been discharged: 
Provided further that the Commissioner shall be deemed to 
have issued the exemption certificate upon the expiry of fifteen days 
to the aforesaid company and the certificate shall be automatically 
processed and issued by Iris: 
Provided also that the Commissioner may modify or cancel 
the certificate issued automatically by Iris on the basis of reasons to 
be recorded in writing after providing an opportunity of being 
heard.” 
The amended sub-section (4) reads as follows: - 
“(4) 
The Commissioner may, on application made by the 
recipient of a payment referred to in sub-section (1) and after 
making such inquiry as the Commissioner thinks fit, may allow in 
cases where tax deductible under sub-section (1) is not minimum, by 
an order in writing , any person to make the payment after deduction 
of tax at reduced rate  but such reduction shall not exceed eighty 
percent of the rate specified in the said Division: 
 Provided that the Commissioner shall issue reduced rate 
certificate within fifteen days of filing of application to a company if 
advance tax liability has been discharged: 
Provided further that the Commissioner shall be deemed to 
have issued the reduced rate certificate upon the expiry of fifteen 

5 
W.P No.43578 of 2024 
W.P No.49585 of 2024 
days to the aforesaid company and the certificate shall be 
automatically processed and issued by Iris: 
Provided also that the Commissioner may modify or cancel 
the certificate issued automatically by Iris on the basis of reasons to 
be recorded in writing after providing an opportunity of being 
heard.” 
The aforementioned amendment was introduced through the Finance 
Act, 2024 published in the Gazette of Pakistan on 30.06.2024 which 
was to come into force from 01.07.2024.  However, exemption 
certificates for the period between 01.07.2024 to 31.12.2024 were 
issued in favour of the petitioners on 30.06.2024 and 28.06.2024 
respectively. However, the petitioners-companies had already acquired 
vested rights to exemption before the amendment introduced through 
the Finance Act, 2024. 
8. 
No doubt there is no restriction on the legislative powers to 
enact civil laws with retrospective effect.  A legislature that is 
competent to make a law on a particular subject also has the power to 
legislate such a law with retrospective effect and can, by legislative 
authorization, even take away vested rights.  Hence, when a legislature 
gives retrospective effect to a law, either by express provision or by 
necessary implication, no protection can be afforded to vested rights 
contrary to that law. Similarly, when a legislature enacts a law with 
retrospective effect, the person affected cannot plead the imposition of 
a previously non-existent civil obligation as a ground for declaring the 
law invalid.  However, every statute that relates to substantive rights 
and obligations should be deemed prospective unless, by express 
provision or necessary implication, it has been given retrospective 
effect.  By now it is well settled that the Courts must lean against 
giving a statute retrospective effect that affects vested rights and/or 
past and closed transactions by adhering to two rules: first, if two 
interpretations are reasonably possible, the one that saves vested rights 
and/or past and closed transactions should be adopted; and second, no 

6 
W.P No.43578 of 2024 
W.P No.49585 of 2024 
statute should be construed to have retrospective effect to a greater 
extent than its language necessarily requires.  Reliance in this regard is 
placed on the cases of Molasses Trading vs. Federation of Pakistan 
(1993 SCMR 1905) and Muhammad Hussain and others vs. 
Muhammad and others (2000 SCMR 367).  
9. 
The Finance Act, 2024 through which the amendment in 
question is introduced has been made effective from 01.07.2024.  
There is no provision of the Finance Act, 2024 that expressly or by 
necessary implication gives any retrospective effect or application to 
the amended section 153(4) of the Ordinance.  Therefore, the 
aforementioned amendment cannot be construed to affect the 
exemption certificates issued in favour of the petitioners on 30.06.2024 
and 28.06.2024 respectively in accordance with the law existing at the 
relevant time.  The amendment introduced through the Finance Act, 
2024 is applicable on all exemption certificates issued after its 
effective date i.e. 01.07.2024.   
10. 
For the foregoing reasons, both the petitions are allowed to the 
extent that the impugned notices as well as the impugned orders are 
hereby set aside.  The petitioners are held entitled to avail the benefit 
of exemption pursuant to the exemption certificates issued in their 
favour on 30.06.2024 and 28.06.2024 respectively.  There shall be no 
order as to costs.
