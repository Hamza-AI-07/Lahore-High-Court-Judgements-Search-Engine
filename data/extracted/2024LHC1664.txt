connected petitions listed in Schedule-A beside this petition, as 
common questions of law and facts are involved in all these 
constitutional petitions.  
2. 
The Petitioner in the instant petition and in the connected 
petitions (hereinafter would be referred as the “Petitioners”) have 

W.P.No.4290 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3 
challenged the vires of show cause notices (the “impugned notices”) 
under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973 (the “Constitution”) issued under Section 24(2) of the Punjab 
Sales Tax on Services Act, 2012 (the “Act”) by the Respondent 
No.3/Additional Commissioner Punjab Revenue Authority, Finance 
Department, Government of Punjab.  
3. 
Learned counsel for the “Petitioners” inter alia argued that 
the “Petitioners” are taxpayers and have regularly been paying taxes 
but the estimate given by the Respondent No.3 in the “impugned 
notices” is based on assumptions which is contrary to data already 
provided by the “Petitioners” in their returns under Section 35 of the 
“Act”; that a notice in terms of Section 52 of the “Act” was to be 
issued before the “impugned notices” for the purpose of recovery of 
tax not levied or short levied; that the “impugned notices” have not 
been issued by a competent authority.  
4. 
Learned counsel for the Respondents, on the other hand, filed 
report and parawise comments and defended the “impugned notices” 
by stating that the same have been issued due to concealment of sales 
and short payments of tax due. 
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
6.  
The question that looms large before the Court is whether the 
Respondent No.3 can straightaway issue notice under Section 24(2) of 
the “Act” to the taxpayer in connection with not levied or short levied 
tax. The procedure for the assessment of tax liability is laid in Section 
24 of the “Act” which reads as: 
24. Assessment of tax.– (1) Where on the 
basis of any information acquired during an 
audit, inquiry, inspection or otherwise, an 
officer of the Authority is of the opinion that a 
registered person has not paid the tax due on 
taxable services provided by him or has made 
short payment, the officer shall make an 
assessment of the tax actually payable by that 
person and shall impose a penalty and charge 

W.P.No.4290 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4 
default surcharge in accordance with sections 
48 and 49. 
(2)  No order under sub-section (1) shall be 
made unless a notice to show cause is given to 
the person in default within [eight] years from 
the conclusion of the tax period to which the 
assessment relates specifying the grounds on 
which it is intended to proceed against him 
and 
the 
said 
officer 
shall 
take 
into 
consideration the representation made by 
such person and provide him with an 
opportunity of being heard if the person so 
desires. 
(3)  An order under sub-section (1) shall be 
made within one hundred and twenty days of 
issuance of the show cause notice or within 
such extended period as the officer may, for 
reasons to be recorded in writing, fix 
provided that such extended period shall 
ordinarily not exceed sixty days. 
(4)  In computing the period specified in sub-
section (3), any period during which the 
proceedings are adjourned on account of a 
stay order or proceedings under section 69 or 
the time taken through adjournments by the 
person shall be excluded. 
(5)  An order passed by an officer under sub-
section (1) may be further amended as may be 
necessary when on the basis of any additional 
information acquired during an audit, inquiry, 
inspection or otherwise, the officer is satisfied 
that– 
(a)  any tax has been under-assessed 
or assessed at a low rate; or 
(b)  any taxable service provided by the 
person has escaped assessment. 
(6)  The provisions of sub-sections (2), (3) and 
(4) shall be applicable to an order passed 
under sub-section (5). 
 
. 
Section 24(1) of the “Act” empowers an officer of the authority 
to make an assessment of the tax liability on the basis of any 
information acquired during an audit, inquiry, inspection or otherwise, 
if he draws opinion that a registered person has not paid the due tax or 
he has made a short payment on account thereof. Significant to 

W.P.No.4290 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5 
mention here that, in course of such assessment, assessing officer 
under Section 24(2) of the “Act” was obliged as well to afford the 
“Petitioners” with opportunity of making a representation as well as 
hearing. Though, admittedly the “impugned notices” were issued by 
the Respondent No.3 under Section 24(2) of the “Act”, but according 
to learned counsel for the “Petitioners”, the objections taken up by 
the “Petitioners” in their respective replies have not even been 
considered nor have the “Petitioners” been afforded opportunity of 
hearing and huge amount of sales tax have been assessed against 
them. Moreover, it is quite considerable that the alleged information 
supplied to the Respondent No.3 by the Punjab Revenue Authority 
has not been conveyed to the “Petitioners” in black and white 
enabling them to counter, repel and falsify such information. Learned 
counsel for the “Petitioners” has also stressed hard that no notice is 
served upon the “Petitioners” as was required under Section 52 of the 
“Act”, which reads as follows: 
 
52. Recovery of tax not levied or short-levied.– 
(1) Where by reason of inadvertence, error, 
misconstruction or for any other reason, any 
tax or charge has not been levied or has been 
short levied, the person liable to pay such 
amount of the tax or charge shall be served 
with a notice, within [eight] years of the 
relevant tax period requiring him to show cause 
for payment of the amount specified in the 
notice. 
(2)  Where by reason of some collusion, 
abetment, deliberate attempt, mis-statement, 
fraud, forgery, false or fake documents– 
(a)  any tax or charge has not been paid 
or is, short paid, the person liable to pay 
such tax shall be served with a notice 
within [eight] years of relevant tax 
period, requiring him to show cause for 
non-payment of such tax; and 
 
(b)  any amount of the tax is refunded 
which is not due, the person obtaining 
such refund shall be served with a notice 

W.P.No.4290 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6 
within [eight] years of the receipt of such 
refund to show cause for recovery of 
such refund. 
(3)  The officer shall, after considering the 
objections of the person served with a notice 
under sub-sections (1) or (2) or if the objections 
are not received within the stipulated period, 
determine the amount of the tax or charge 
payable by him and such person shall pay the 
amount so determined. 
(4)  Any order under sub-section (3) shall be 
made within one hundred and twenty days of 
issuance of the notice to show cause or within 
such extended period as the officer may, for 
reasons to be recorded in writing, fix provided 
that such extended period shall not ordinarily 
exceed sixty days. 
(5)  In computing the period specified in sub-
section (4), any period during which the 
proceedings are adjourned on account of a stay 
order or proceedings under section 69 or the 
time taken through adjournments by the 
petitioner not exceeding thirty days shall be 
excluded. 
 
  
Above reproduced Section 52(3) of the “Act” clearly 
manifests that the officer concerned shall determine the tax liability 
after considering the objections of the person served with notice, 
which obligation cast upon the Respondent No.3 finds lacking in 
connection with “impugned notices”. In addition thereto, for the 
purpose of requisite inquiry for assessment of tax, the Respondent 
No.3 has not set in field procedure laid down in Section 57 of the 
“Act” requiring the relevant record for such assessment. The said 
section reads as under: 
57. Obligation to produce documents and 
provide information.– (1) Notwithstanding 
anything contained in this Act or any other 
law, any person required to maintain any 
record under this Act and the rules, shall, on 
demand by an officer, [**] by notice in 
writing, as and when specified in the notice– 
(a)  produce for examination, such 
documents or records which the officer 

W.P.No.4290 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7 
considers necessary or relevant to the 
audit, inquiry or investigation under this 
Act; 
(b)  allow the officer to take extracts 
from or make copies of such documents 
or records; and 
(c)  appear before the officer and 
answer any question put to him 
concerning the documents and records 
relating to the audit, inquiry or 
investigation referred to in clause (a). 
(2) An officer conducting an audit, enquiry, 
investigation or otherwise for the purposes of 
the Act or the rules may require in writing any 
person to furnish any information as is held by 
the person.] 
(3)  The Authority [or an officer authorized by 
the Authority] may require, in writing, any 
person, department, company or organization, 
to provide any information or data held by that 
person, department, company or organization, 
which, in the opinion of the Authority, is 
required for purposes of formulation of policy 
or administering or implementing this Act and 
the rules. 
(4)  Every person, department, company or 
organization shall furnish the information 
requisitioned by the Authority or the officer 
under sub-sections (2) or (3), within the time 
specified in the notice issued by the Authority. 
 
  
Intent behind above-mentioned provision of law in connection 
with requisite inquiry is to bring on record justified footings and 
reasons for assessment of tax liabilities on basis of record, however, 
the “impugned notices” clearly reflect to be bereft of a requisite 
inquiry prescribed under umbrella of the “Act”. Under the tax laws, 
a procedure for assessment of tax, information to be sought, and 
recovery of tax has been provided in Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 
(the “Ordinance”), the Sales Tax Act, 1990 (the “Act 1990”) and 
the “Act”. A combined reading of aforesaid statutes especially the 
provisions relating to assessment of tax (Section 122(5) of the 
“Ordinance”, Section 11 of the “Act 1990” and Section 24 of the 

W.P.No.4290 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8 
“Act”), information to be sought (Section 176 of the “Ordinance”, 
Section 38A of the “Act 1990” and Section 53 of the “Act”) and 
recovery of tax (Section 137 of the “Ordinance”), Section 48 of the 
“Act 1990” and Section 52 of the “Act”) shows that these sections 
are identical and envisaging of assessment of tax liability , a (show 
cause notice) notice to confront taxpayer with intended 
assessment/information and to provide him an opportunity of 
hearing. When confronted to learned counsel for the Respondents-
PRA a recent judgment of Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
“COMMISSIONER INLAND REVENUE, LAHORE Versus Messrs 
MILLAT TRACTORS LIMITED, LAHORE and others” (2024 
SCMR 700), holding that the taxpayer is to be confronted with the 
information and the grounds applicable under Section 111(1) 
through a separate notice under the said provision, and then the 
proceedings are to be culminated through an appropriate order in the 
shape of an opinion of the Commissioner. This then becomes 
definite information for the purposes of Section 122(5), provided the 
grounds mentioned in Section 122(5) are applicable, he could not 
justify the situation in favour of the Respondents by even analogy of 
similar sections of aforesaid tax laws and the settled principles of 
Supreme Court of Pakistan enunciated from time to time. Recently, 
the Division Bench of this Court in Income Tax Reference No.03 of 
2023 titled “Zubair Khan Versus Commissioner Inland Revenue 
Jhelum Zone etc” decided vide judgment dated 02.04.2024 also 
affirmed the view of issuance of notice before passing any 
assessment by relying on the judgments of Supreme Court of 
Pakistan.  
 
7. 
Furthermore, the replies of the “Petitioners” filed with the 
Respondent No.3 are still pending adjudication, contentions set forth 
wherein have not been taken into consideration by the Respondent 
No.3 nor the “Petitioners” have been afforded with opportunity of 

W.P.No.4290 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9 
hearing in relation thereto, which otherwise is requirement of law in 
compliance to Article 10-A of the “Constitution”. Statutory 
principle 
of 
law 
is that 
a thing 
should be done as 
it is 
required to be done by law and not otherwise. This Court in case 
“Shell Pakistan Limited Vs. Punjab through the Secretary 
Ministry of Finance and others” (2020 PTD 1607), pertaining 
issue under the “Act”, has held that “Article 10-A of the 
Constitution provides and protects fundamental right of citizen to 
have fair trial and due process and Courts are charged with duty 
to protect those rights including the rights of tax payers.” In 
another 
tax 
dispute, 
in 
case 
“Mubashir 
Yameen 
Vs. 
Assistant/Deputy 
Commissioner 
Inland 
Revenue, 
RTO, 
Rawalpindi and others” (2023 PTD 146), this court held that 
“Under Article 4 of the Constitution, it is an inalienable right of 
the citizen to be treated in accordance with law. Also the fair trial 
and due process are the fundamental rights of the every citizen of 
Pakistan under Article 10-A of the Constitution.” Moreover, it is 
held in case “Mirpurkhas Sugar Mills Limited through Wasif 
Khalid and 19 others Vs. Federation of Pakistan through 
Secretary, Cabinet Division, Islamabad and 9 others” (PLD 2021 
Sindh 418): 
“8. At the very outset we note that any form of 
corruption, tax evasion, money laundering, 
illegal cartelization needs to be stamped out 
with an iron hand but at the same time this 
must be done in accordance with law and by 
following due process as mandated by Article 
10(A) of the Constitution so that every suspect 
has a fair opportunity to clear his name and 
position. Only through the executive following 
the law, acting in accordance with the law 
and treating every one equally before the law 
and jealously guarding a suspects due process 
rights and dignity as mandated by Articles 4, 
25, 10(A) and 14 of the Constitution will the 
rule of law and good governance be enhanced 

W.P.No.4290 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10 
and peoples faith in the democratic system 
grow.” 
 
8. 
As has been discussed above that “impugned notices” are 
without the strength of due inquiry and the “Petitioners” have not 
been afforded with opportunity of hearing as well as objections raised 
by them in their respective replies have not been given due 
consideration 
as held in 
case 
“COMMISSIONER 
INLAND 
REVENUE, LAHORE” supra and the principles enunciated in above-
referred judgment by the Supreme Court of Pakistan has been 
followed and is binding under Article 189 of the Constitution of 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. Therefore, the “impugned 
notices” cannot be allowed to breath in field anymore. Consequently, 
all the writ petitions are allowed and the “impugned notices” are 
hereby set aside. The matter is remitted to the Respondent No.3 with a 
direction to first conduct due inquiry in all the petitions in terms of 
Section 57 of the “Act” after ensuring submission of replies by all the 
“Petitioners” 
in 
relation 
thereto, 
to 
secure/receive 
the 
record/documents from the “Petitioners”/relevant corners, if desired, 
and then to decide objections raised by the “Petitioners” in their 
respective replies through speaking orders. The said exercise shall be 
done by the said Respondent within a period of thirty (30) days from 
the receipt of certified copy of this judgment. The parties concerned 
shall appear before the Respondent No.3 on 02.05.2024.
