ALI ZIA BAJWA, J.:- By dint of the instant 
Constitutional Petition filed under Article 199 of the Constitution of the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (hereinafter ‘the Constitution’) read with 

2 
Writ Petition No.61743-H/2023
 
Section 491 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (hereinafter ‘the 
Code’) the petitioner invited indulgence of this Court seeking direction for 
the recovery and production of Shahbaz son of Bashir and Muhammad Yar 
son of Waryam, brother-in-law and nephew of the petitioner, (hereinafter 
‘the detenus’), from the illegal, improper and unlawful custody of 
respondents No.2 and 3. 
2. 
Through the order dated 22.09.2023, notice was issued to 
respondent No.2/Station House Officer, Police Station Manga Mandi, 
Lahore, and respondent No.3/Station House Officer, Police Station 
Ferozewala, District Sheikhupura to produce the detenus before the Court. 
On 25.09.2023 The Superintendent of Police (Investigation) Saddar 
Division, Lahore appeared before the Court and reported that the detenus 
lost their lives during an alleged police encounter that occurred in the early 
hours of 27.06.2023, precisely at 4:20 a.m. In that regard case FIR 
No.1601/2023, offences under Sections 302, 324, 353 & 186 PPC read with 
Section 13-2(a) of The Arms Ordinance, 1965 was registered at Police 
Station Manga Mandi, Lahore. He further informed the Court that following 
the police encounter, autopsies were conducted, and subsequently, the 
bodies were interred in the graveyard of Manga Mandi, Lahore. 
3. 
Shockingly, the record reflected that no efforts, whatsoever, 
were made by the police to trace out the whereabouts of the legal heirs of the 
detenus. A notice was issued to the Deputy Inspector General of Police 
(Investigation), Lahore. Additionally, the Medical Superintendent of Mian 
Munshi Hospital, Lahore, was instructed to produce the record of the 
postmortem examination reports of the detenus. D.I.G. (Investigation), 
Lahore appeared before the Court and stated that he went through the police 
file and noted certain illegalities. It was also brought to the notice of this 
Court that a criminal case, FIR No. 2677/2023, under Section 155-C of the 
Police Order, 2002, and Section 166 of the PPC, has been registered at the 
Manga Mandi Police Station, Lahore, for tampering with the police file of 
the aforementioned criminal case against the delinquent police officials. 
Medical Superintendent, Mian Munshi Hospital, Lahore apprised the Court 
that postmortem examination reports of the detenus were not obtained from 
the hospital by the police without any reason.

Writ Petition No.61743-H/2023
 
4. 
It was a harrowing situation where the detenus were killed in an 
alleged police encounter under suspicious circumstances, and their dead 
bodies were buried instead of being handed over to their legal heirs. Such 
flagrant brutality on the part of the police officials could not be swept under 
the rug. The above situation emerged as a textbook case of police atrocities 
and high-handedness. The case exemplified the worst aspects of police 
misconduct, marked by blatant abuse of power and brutal treatment of 
individuals in custody. Learned amici curiae posited that after the enactment 
of The Torture and Custodial Death (Prevention and Punishment) Act, 2022 
(hereinafter referred to as ‘the Act of 2022’), in instances where allegations 
of custodial torture, rape, or death are raised against public officials, only the 
Federal Investigation Agency (hereinafter ‘the Agency’) possesses the 
requisite authority to conduct investigations. 
5. 
In the above scenario, notices were issued to the Federal 
Government, the Advocate General Punjab, and the Inspector General of 
Police Punjab to explain why the investigation of all the cases of custodial 
torture, deaths and rapes should not be transferred to the Agency. Notice was 
also issued to the Prosecutor General Punjab to explain why the concerned 
prosecutor remained silent regarding the illegality committed by the police 
and to assist the Court regarding the competence of the police to investigate 
the cases of custodial torture, deaths and rapes. Reports were also 
requisitioned from both, the Director General of the Agency and the 
Chairperson of the National Commission for Human Rights (hereinafter ‘the 
Commission’) concerning the non-implementation of the Act of 2022. All 
the requisite reports have been filed. On 30.01.2024, the Superintendent of 
Police (Investigation), Saddar Division, Lahore apprised the Court that the 
investigation in this case was referred to the Agency for further proceedings. 
6. 
Arguments heard and the record available on the file perused. 
 
7. 
Within the legal structure of a society committed to the tenets 
of lawful governance, instances of custodial torture, rapes, and deaths 
represent flagrant breaches of fundamental human rights. The rights inherent 
in Articles 4, 9, 10, 10-A, and 14 of the Constitution require to be jealously 
and scrupulously protected by the Courts. The custodial torture and extra- 

4 
Writ Petition No.61743-H/2023
 
judicial killings blatantly violate the above-referred Constitutional 
protections and strike a blow at the rule of law. The act of executing or 
subjecting a suspect to torture without affording him the opportunity for a 
fair trial constitutes a flagrant disregard for the legal framework, due 
process, and the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution, thereby 
undermining the very foundation of justice. In Benazir Bhutto1 Supreme 
Court of Pakistan defined extra-legal executions as killings ‘which have no 
sanction or permission under the law, or which cannot be covered or 
defended under any provision of law’. 
8. 
Complaints of custodial torture and deaths remained rampant in 
our country. Numerous attempts were made to introduce legislative reforms 
specifically addressing this issue, yet all these efforts had consistently 
resulted in failure in the past.2 At long last, in November of 2022, the Act of 
2022 was promulgated. The Act of 2022 reflects Pakistan’s commitments 
under multiple international accords, especially the United Nations 
Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment (UNCAT). Pakistan became a signatory to this 
Convention in 2008 and ratified it in 2010, emphasizing the international 
mandate for domestic laws that explicitly criminalize torture. The UNCAT 
explicitly mandates the creation of national legislation that categorically 
outlaws acts of torture, emphasizing the need for Pakistan to align its legal 
framework with international standards to effectively prevent and penalize 
custodial torture.3 
9. 
With the enactment of the Act of 2022, Pakistan has embarked 
on a new era where the protection of human rights is genuinely assured, 
both in substance and practice. This piece of legislation marks a significant 
milestone in the country’s commitment to upholding the fundamental rights 
of its citizens. The Act of 2022 represents a formative legislative measure 
aimed at eliminating the menace of torture, rapes and deaths occurring 
under the custody of public officials, affirming the commitment of the State 
to uphold human rights and ensure the dignity of individuals under its

dominion. In essence, the Act of 2022 is a robust legal instrument designed 
to significantly curb the risks of custodial torture, rapes and deaths. By 
launching a clear legal mechanism for accountability, prevention, and 
victim support, the Act of 2022 represents a critical step forward in the 
protection of human rights and the promotion of justice and dignity for all 
individuals under the care of the State. This ambitious and comprehensive 
legislation includes many important aspects designed to eradicate the 
heinous incidents of custodial torture, rapes, and casualties. It is fitting to 
briefly outline the main features of the Act of 2022. 
A. 
Offenses punishable under the Act 
 
 Custodial torture, death, and rape have been criminalized under the 
Act of 2022 as part of a determined effort to wipe out these grave 
offenses.4 The term ‘custody’ encompasses all circumstances in which 
an individual is detained or deprived of his liberty by any person, 
including a public official or someone acting in an official capacity. 
This definition applies regardless of the legality, nature, or location of 
the detention. The definition of ‘custody’ extends to judicial custody 
and encompasses all forms of temporary and permanent restrictions 
on a person’s movement, whether imposed by law, force, or other 
methods. Furthermore, an individual is considered to be in custody 
during proceedings involving search, arrest, and seizure.5 The term
‘torture’ has been explained in Section 2 (n) of the Act of 2022 in a 
self-explanatory manner. 
 “Custodial death” refers to the death of an individual that occurs while 
in custody and results directly or indirectly from acts of torture 
inflicted upon the deceased during his detention. This includes deaths 
that take place within police stations, private or medical facilities, 
public spaces, transport vehicles, or jails. It also includes fatalities 
occurring during arrest, detention, or interrogation processes. 
Additionally, custodial death covers instances where an individual 
dies after being released from custody, if the death can be directly

5 Section 2(f) of the Act of 2022 

6 
Writ Petition No.61743-H/2023
 
linked to, and substantially attributed to, the treatment they received 
while detained.6 
 “Custodial rape” refers to instances where an individual exploits his 
position to commit rape or sexual abuse on a person under his custody 
or in the custody of a public official subordinate to him. This 
definition captures the misuse of authority to violate the personal 
integrity and rights of those detained.7
B. 
Exclusive Jurisdiction of Agency to investigate under the supervision 
of the Commission 
 Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in existing laws, the 
Agency shall possess the exclusive jurisdiction to investigate, under 
the supervision of the Commission, the complaints against any public 
official accused of committing offenses under the Act of 2022. While 
investigating offenses under the Act of 2022, the Agency is endowed 
with the same powers and is required to adhere to the procedure 
outlined in the Federal Investigation Agency Act, 1974 (Act VIII of 
1975), and the rules established thereunder.8 Although the term
‘custody’ under the Act of 2022 is inclusive in nature covering all 
situations in which an individual is detained or deprived of his liberty 
by any person, including a public official or someone acting in an 
official capacity, the Agency has the authority only to investigate 
offenses committed specifically by public officials. 
 Under Section 5(1) of the Act of 2022, although the term ‘complaint’ 
is mentioned but it does not carry the same procedural and restrictive 
definition as found in Section 4(h) of the Code. The complaint under 
the Code means an allegation made orally or in writing to a 
Magistrate, with a view to his taking action under the Code, that some 
person, whether known or unknown, has committed an offense. This 
definition explicitly excludes reports made by police officers. 
Whereas the Act of 2022 uses ‘complaint’ in a broader sense to 
include any allegations or reports against public officials that the
 
6 Section 2 (h) of the Act of 2022 
7 Section 2 (i) of the Act of 2022 
8 Section 5 of the Act of 2022 

7 
Writ Petition No.61743-H/2023
 
Agency can investigate. This broader scope seeks to empower the 
Agency to take cognizance of various forms of information and 
allegations, 
thereby 
ensuring 
meticulous 
investigations 
into 
accusations of custodial torture, deaths, and rapes leveled against 
public officials. Section 5 of the Act of 2022 is a non-obstante clause 
having an overriding effect over any other conflicting provisions of 
law. The phrase non-obstante is Latin for ‘notwithstanding’, 
indicating that the specific provision will prevail despite anything to 
the contrary in other laws. Moreover, all the offenses under the Act of 
2022 are cognizable in nature. A cognizable offense denotes a crime 
for which a police officer is empowered to make an arrest without a 
warrant.9 
 Given the widespread complaints of custodial torture and deaths 
involving police officials, an imperative arose for a mechanism to 
ensure such allegations are investigated by an independent agency. It
was also ruled by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in Zeeshan alias 
Shani10 that in case of a police encounter, it is desirable and even 
imperative that it should be investigated by some other agency. The 
Act of 2022 establishes a twofold mechanism for oversight in the 
investigation of offenses perpetrated by public officials under its 
provisions. 
 The primary tier confers exclusive jurisdiction upon the Agency, 
making it the sole authority empowered to investigate specific 
allegations of custodial torture, deaths and rapes against public
officials. This centralization of expertise and authority ensures a 
streamlined, specialized approach by a neutral and independent 
agency. Consolidating skills and decision-making power within a 
dedicated entity guarantees investigations are conducted with 
impartiality, precision, and a thorough understanding of the 
complexities involved. The constitution of a specialized wing 
dedicated to the implementation of the purpose of the Act of 2022 in 
its true letter and spirit would be immensely beneficial.

10 Zeeshan alias Shani Vs. The State – 2012 SCMR 428 

8 
Writ Petition No.61743-H/2023
 
 The second tier of oversight has been provided by the supervision of 
investigation process by the Commission. This supervision is crucial 
as it introduces an additional level of scrutiny, ensuring that the
investigations are conducted with a commitment to human rights 
standards. This dual structure is designed to enhance accountability 
and transparency in handling sensitive cases of custodial torture, 
deaths and rapes involving public officials. It aims to prevent any 
abuse of power or negligence in the investigative process and ensures 
that the rights of all individuals involved are respected and upheld 
throughout the proceedings. The supervisory role of the Commission 
has been designed to infuse the investigative process with 
transparency and fairness. This supervisory role ensures that the 
proceedings are conducted openly and justly, shielding them from any 
undue influence or bias. By maintaining vigilant oversight, the 
Commission helps to uphold the integrity of the investigation, thereby 
promoting a culture of accountability and trust in how allegations 
against public officials are handled. 
  The supervision by the Commission must be profound and 
meaningful, encompassing several key aspects vital for achieving the 
ends for which the Act of 2022 was promulgated. Meaningful 
supervision entails proactive oversight of investigations, where the 
Commission does not merely receive reports but actively monitors the 
progress of investigations. This includes reviewing procedures, 
ensuring compliance with legal standards, and making periodic checks 
to prevent any potential misuse of power or negligence. Supervision is 
about holding investigators accountable for their actions or inaction. 
This means ensuring that any deviation from the lawful process or any 
misconduct is promptly addressed. Meaningful supervision also 
includes providing guidance and support to the investigating Agency. 
This could involve training programs and offering expert advice to 
conduct thorough and fair investigations. Engaging with stakeholders, 
including victims, witnesses, and the general public, is part of 
meaningful supervision. The Commission should ensure that all 
parties involved in the investigation are treated fairly and impartially.

9 
Writ Petition No.61743-H/2023
 
This includes protecting the rights of the accused while also ensuring 
justice for victims. Scrupulous supervision is crucial for maintaining 
the integrity and effectiveness of the legal framework, ensuring a 
respected and resilient criminal justice system. 
C. 
A statement or confession extracted through torture inadmissible in 
evidence. 
 Any statement, information, or confession extracted by a public 
official through torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading 
treatment is deemed inadmissible as evidence in any legal proceedings 
against the individual who made or provided it. A public official who 
knowingly employs information obtained through torture or other 
prohibited means shall face potential legal consequences. This public 
official could be sentenced to imprisonment for up to one year, fined 
up to one hundred thousand rupees, or subjected to both penalties.11 
The rationale behind this provision of law is twofold and crucial. 
Firstly, confessions obtained under duress are unreliable and coerced, 
undermining the integrity of the legal process. Secondly, allowing 
such evidence endorses and perpetuates torture, violating fundamental 
rights guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution. Lastly, 
excluding such evidence protects individuals from abuse, upholds 
fairness, and maintains public trust in the legal system. Furthermore, it 
reinforces the provisions outlined in Articles 37, 38 and 39 of the 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, which unequivocally exclude 
confessional statements made before an investigating officer.
D. 
Special protection for females and female accused. 
 The Act of 2022 affords extraordinary protection to women by 
stipulating that no woman shall be detained for the purpose of 
extracting information about the whereabouts of a person accused of 
any offense, or to coerce evidence from her. The Act of 2022 further 
mandates that no female shall be taken into or held in custody by a 
male, except by a female public official who is legally authorized to 
do so.12 The provision outlined in the Act of 2022 serves several
 
11 Section 3 of the Act of 2022 
12 Section 4 of the Act of 2022 

10
Writ Petition No.61743-H/2023
 
critical purposes, primarily focused on safeguarding the dignity, 
safety, and rights of women in investigative procedures. It reflects an 
understanding of the specific needs and vulnerabilities of women in 
the criminal justice system. The aim is to create a more gender- 
sensitive approach that respects the rights of women and avoids 
exploitative situations. By embedding such protections in law, the Act 
of 2022 also sends a strong societal message about the importance of 
respecting the rights of females and the need for tailored protections 
based on gender-specific concerns. This can contribute to broader 
cultural shifts toward ensuring procedural protections for women in 
the criminal justice system. Overall, legal provision intends to ensure 
that women’s rights are specifically protected within the framework of 
criminal investigations, reflecting a commitment to protect the dignity 
and respect in handling legal and investigative procedures involving 
women. 
E. 
The time frame for investigation and trial 
 
 The investigation into the offenses stipulated by the Act of 2022 must 
be concluded within thirty days following the filing of the complaint. 
If the investigation of an offense under this statute does not conclude 
within thirty days, the Agency shall summon a report to account for 
the delay. Should the reasons for the delay prove unsatisfactory, the 
Agency may reassign the case to a new investigating officer, who 
shall assume the investigation from the juncture it was abandoned and 
swiftly complete the same. If the investigation remains incomplete 
after thirty days, the Agency must submit an interim investigation 
report to the Court of Sessions. Upon reviewing this report, the court 
may decide to commence the trial based on the material presented 
therein. The trial of the offenses delineated under the Act of 2022 shall 
be concluded within three weeks from the date the investigation report 
is submitted to the court of competent jurisdiction.13
 The stipulations provided in the Act of 2022 are designed to ensure 
the expeditious handling of cases of custodial torture, deaths and rapes
 
13 Section 13 of the Act of 2022 

11
Writ Petition No.61743-H/2023
 
alongside the accountability of the investigating officers. By 
mandating that investigations be completed within a thirty days 
window, the law emphasizes the importance of efficiency in legal 
proceedings. This expeditiousness is intended to prevent undue delays 
that could impede the course of justice, ensuring that the cases are 
decided promptly and that victims and accused persons are not left in 
prolonged uncertainty. The requirement for the Agency to report 
delays if the investigation exceeds the requisite time frame ensures 
accountability. This provision acts as a safeguard against laxity and 
neglect, compelling investigating officers to maintain diligence and 
focus. The mandate for submitting an interim investigation report to 
the Court of Sessions if the investigation is not concluded on time, 
places a mechanism of judicial oversight over the investigation 
process. This enables the court to review the progress of the case and 
decide whether enough evidence exists to begin the trial, thus 
maintaining a continuous push to conclude the trial at the earliest. 
Stipulating a definitive three-week period for the completion of the 
trial once the investigation report is submitted enforces a strict 
timeline that further highlights the commitment to timely justice. The 
Act of 2022 has been structured to create a more responsive and 
efficient criminal justice system that upholds the norms of justice by 
ensuring that investigators remain accountable, cases are concluded 
expeditiously, and all parties involved are assured that their rights and 
concerns are addressed within reasonable and predictable time frame. 
F. 
Protection to the victim and witnesses etc. 
 
 Any person, including the victim, complainant, or witnesses, who 
asserts the need for protection from a person accused of committing 
an offense under this Act, or from any associates of the accused, shall 
file a petition with the Court of Sessions. The court shall adjudicate 
such a petition after providing all the concerned parties an opportunity 
to be heard and shall issue an appropriate order considering the facts 
and circumstances of the case.14 Allowing any person, be it a victim, 
complainant, or witness, to seek protection, this provision addresses
 
14 Section 14 of the Act of 2022 

12
Writ Petition No.61743-H/2023
 
the fundamental need for safety and security from those accused of 
crimes or their associates. By providing a clear mechanism for 
seeking protection, this provision helps to build trust in the criminal 
justice system. It reassures the stakeholders and aggrieved persons 
that the law shall actively work to protect their rights and safety, 
encouraging 
greater 
cooperation 
with 
legal 
authorities 
and 
participation in the judicial process. 
G. 
Punishment for filing mala-fide complaints 
 
 Anyone who files a complaint in bad faith, upon confirmation that the 
complaint was malicious, shall receive the same punishment as 
outlined in Section 8 for offenders under the Act of 2022.15 This legal 
provision plays a crucial role in deterring individuals from lodging 
false complaints against public officials. By imposing the same 
penalties on those who file complaints with mala fide, the law acts as 
a significant deterrent against the misuse of the provisions of the Act 
of 2022. False complaints can severely undermine the morale and 
confidence 
of 
public 
officials, 
potentially 
hampering 
their 
effectiveness in dealing with criminal activities. When public officials 
are unjustly targeted, it can create an atmosphere of mistrust and 
caution, which might impede their willingness to take decisive actions 
against criminals. By ensuring that malicious complainants face 
stringent consequences, this law protects public officials from undue 
harassment.
H. Duties of the Government regarding the Publicity and awareness of the 
Act of 2022 
 The Government16 is required to take all necessary measures to ensure 
that the provisions of the Act of 2022 receive extensive publicity 
through the media at regular intervals. Additionally, relevant public
officials must undergo periodic sensitization and awareness training 
 
15 Section 11 of the Act of 2022 
16 Under Section 2 (j) of the Act of 2022 „Government‟ refers to either the Federal Government or the 
Provincial Government, depending on the context. 

13
Writ Petition No.61743-H/2023
 
concerning the issues addressed in the Act of 2022.17 The publicity of 
a newly promulgated law is essential for its effective implementation. 
When laws are widely publicized, it becomes difficult for those in 
authority to apply these laws on their whims and wishes arbitrarily. 
Public knowledge of the law acts as a check on the actions or 
inactions of the authorities, ensuring that the law is applied uniformly 
and justly across all sections of society. This widespread awareness is 
key to ensuring compliance with the law, as people are more likely to 
adhere to laws they understand and are familiar with. Publicizing the 
penal statute extensively also serves a preventive function. Potential 
offenders are deterred by their knowledge of the legal consequences 
of their actions, reducing the likelihood of infractions. 
 
 Wide publicity also opens channels for feedback from the public, 
which can be invaluable for refining and improving the 
implementation of the law. When individuals know what protections 
and avenues for recourse are available to them under the law, they are 
better equipped to defend their rights. This knowledge empowers 
citizens to take appropriate actions if they encounter situations 
covered by the Act of 2022, thereby enhancing their protection. The 
extensive publicity of the Act of 2022 is integral to its success, 
ensuring it is effectively implemented and achieves its intended goals 
of promoting fairness, preventing misuse of power, and protecting the 
rights of individuals in custody. In nutshell, the publicity of newly 
promulgated law is not just a procedural formality but a fundamental 
aspect of its successful implementation. It shall ensure that law does 
not exist in a vacuum but is integrated into the daily lives of the 
citizens, thereby strengthening the legal system and democratic 
governance.
10. 
However, despite promulgation of the Act of 2022 in 
November 2022 following approval from the President, the law remained 
largely on paper, with no practical implementation. This situation highlights 
a significant gap between the formal adoption of the law and its actual 
enforcement, reducing it to a mere document without substantial impact. The 
17 Section 18 of the Act of 2022 

14
Writ Petition No.61743-H/2023
 
Act of 2022, despite its grand promises and visionary provisions, has 
regrettably remained a paper law, with no tangible implementation. A ‘paper 
law’ refers to legislation that has been formally enacted and exists in legal 
documents but is not effectively implemented or enforced in practice.18 
11. 
The reports submitted by the Agency and the Commission 
reveal a disheartening reality that the stakeholders, as designated under the 
Act of 2022, have demonstrated a marked indifference towards the 
enforcement of this crucial legislation. This apathy towards implementing 
the law highlights a profound disregard for the legal provisions it contains 
and the protections it seeks to guarantee. Section 9 of the National 
Commission for Human Rights Pakistan Act, 2012 (hereinafter ‘NCHR 
Act’) delineates the functions of the Commission, endowing the Commission 
with Suo Moto power to fulfill its mandate. Specifically, under Section 9(d) 
of the NCHR Act, the Commission is charged with recommending the 
adoption of administrative measures for the effective implementation of 
existing laws related to human rights violations. Similarly, Rule 3 of the 
Federal Investigation Agency (Inquiries and Investigations) Rules, 2002 
stipulates that the Agency, subject to Rules 4 and 5, may commence an 
inquiry or investigation either on its own volition or upon receiving a 
complaint, whether oral or written. Regrettably, the Commission and 
Agency have demonstrated a significant degree of indifference in enforcing 
the Act of 2022. 
12. 
The vital duty of the Commission has been wholly neglected, 
resulting in a profound miscarriage of justice in countless cases. The 
legislative intent behind the conferment of such significant powers upon the 
Commission was to ensure a vigilant and proactive stance against human 
rights violations. The Commission’s failure to fulfill its expressly mandated 
functions, despite the extensive powers granted by the Parliament, 
constitutes a profound betrayal of its purpose. This dereliction of duty not 
only undermines the authority of the Commission but also perpetuates a

Public officials are bound to operate within the confines of the 
Constitution. Article 5(2), read in conjunction with Article 4 of the 
Constitution, unequivocally mandates that all public functionaries perform 
their duties in strict adherence to the law.19 The laws enacted by Parliament 
represent the will of the people and form the cornerstone of the legal 
framework of the Country. As such, these laws must be implemented with 
full fidelity and without exception. The public functionaries hold no 
authority to sit on their hands and disregard the implementation of a law 
duly passed by the Parliament. The executive cannot shun its duty to enforce 
the statutes set forth by the representatives of the people. All State 
functionaries, including governmental departments and agencies, are 
obligated to ensure the proper execution of these laws. This duty is not 
merely procedural but foundational to the rule of law, maintaining the 
integrity and effectiveness of the legal system. Compliance with enacted 
laws is paramount, ensuring that the governance of the state supports the 
democratic principles and mandates set forth by its elected representatives. If 
state functionaries fail to implement laws enacted by the Parliament, it will 
result in complete chaos. The legal system’s authority would be undermined, 
leading to a breakdown in the rule of law. The failure to implement a law 
due to negligence, inaction, or indifference by public functionaries, resulting 
in violation of fundamental rights, cannot be ignored by this Court when 
exercising its Constitutional jurisdiction under Article 199 of the 
Constitution. The principle that the failure of public functionaries to adhere

act within legal bounds because any deviation reflects a malicious disregard 
for the rule of law.

This Court finds itself compelled to issue the directions 
necessitating the involvement of the highest echelons of our Governmental 
structure to ensure the prompt implementation of the Act of 2022 without 
further delay. This Court hereby directs that: - 
I. 
The issue of implementation of the Act of 2022 shall be formally 
brought to the attention of the Chief Minister of Punjab, conveyed 
through the Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister. Simultaneously, 
the issue shall also be presented to the Federal Minister, Ministry of 
Interior, Government of Pakistan, through the Federal Secretary 
Ministry of Interior. They shall assiduously ensure the swift and 
thorough execution of the Act of 2022, sparing no effort to guarantee 
its full and immediate implementation. Their prompt and decisive 
intervention is essential to ensure the effective enforcement of the Act 
of 2022, thereby precluding any further delay in its execution. 
II. 
A copy of this judgment shall be dispatched to the Chairperson of the 
National Human Rights Commission of Pakistan and the Director 
General of the Agency. They are mandated to assume a proactive role 
and take on the responsibility for the implementation of the Act of 
2022, ensuring that its provisions are diligently and effectively 
enforced. 
III. 
As the Police are devoid of the requisite jurisdiction to investigate 
cases pertaining to allegations of custodial torture, deaths, and rapes, 
therefore, all the cases of custodial torture, deaths, and rapes currently 
under investigation, and registered after the promulgation of the Act 
of 2022, shall forthwith be transferred to the Agency for the purpose 
of investigation by the Provincial Police Officer without fail, in the 
same manner, as the investigation in the case at hand was transferred 
to the Agency.

IV. 
In the future, if the police receive any complaints regarding custodial 
torture, death, or rape, such matters shall be promptly referred to the 
Agency to initiate proceedings swiftly in the spirit of the Act of 2022. 
The police, having no jurisdiction to investigate such cases, ought not 
to drag their feet on these complaints. 
V. 
All the cases of custodial torture, registered after the promulgation of 
the Act of 2022, currently pending trial before any other court shall be 
transferred to the Court of Sessions for trial, per the spirit of Section 6 
of the Act of 2022.  
VI. 
The Government shall undertake all necessary measures to ensure 
comprehensive publicity of the provisions of the Act of 2022. Such 
measures shall include but are not limited to, regular dissemination of 
information through the media to ensure widespread awareness among 
the public. 
VII. 
The relevant public officials must receive periodic sensitization and 
awareness training pertaining to the issues addressed in the Act of 
2022, therefore, training should be arranged and structured to ensure 
that officials are well-informed and adequately prepared to implement 
and uphold the provisions of this Act. 
VIII. 
The Act of 2022 should be implemented with all due haste, leaving no 
stone unturned in that regard without further ado because it is better 
late than never. A copy of this judgment shall also be sent to all the 
stakeholders designated under the Act of 2022, through the Office of 
the Registrar of this Court, to ensure strict compliance. 
15. 
With the investigation of the case arising out of this petition 
now entrusted to the Agency, this petition is disposed of considering the 
aforementioned directions.
