Date of Hearing: 
08.05.2023 
Petitioner by: 
Raja Abdul Rehman, Advocate.  
Respondent No.1 by: Ch. Hamid Mahmood, Advocate. 
       Anwaar Hussain, J.  Briefly stated facts of the case are that the 
petitioner filed an ejectment petition against respondent No.1 („the 
respondent‟), in respect of House No.140, Street No.50, bearing property 
No.SEXVI-50-S-140, measuring 5-Marlas („the rented premises‟), with 
the assertions that on 03.01.1995, the petitioner executed an agreement 
(„the agreement‟) in favour of the respondent, regarding the sale-cum-
tenancy of the rented premises against total consideration of Rs.325,000/- 
and out of the said amount, Rs.100,000/- was received by the petitioner as 
earnest money, and it was further agreed that the remaining amount was to 
be paid by the respondent on 30.03.1995 upon which  the rented premises 
was to be transferred in the name of the respondent; and in case of failure 
on part of the respondent to clear the balance payment, the respondent 
agreed and undertook to pay a sum of Rs.100,000/- as penalty. The pivotal 
and not-so-traditional clause resulting in the present lis was also agreed 
inter se the parties that till the performance of reciprocal contractual 
obligations spelled out above i.e., on or before 30.03.1995, the respondent 
was to be treated as tenant @ monthly rent of Rs.600/-. It is the case of the 
petitioner that the respondent failed to pay the balance amount of 
Rs.225,000/-, within stipulated period of time and instituted a suit for 
specific performance against the petitioner, which stood dismissed on 
account of non-affixation of the Court fee and by use of force, the 

2 
W.P. No.22949 of 2016 
 
 
respondent, in respect of the rented premises, obtained signatures of the 
petitioner on blank papers and maneuvered registration of a general power 
of attorney („the GPA‟) with respect to the rented premises, in favour of 
one Muhammad Ilyas son of Muhammad Yaqoob who is totally an alien 
person to the petitioner. Complaint about the incident was statedly 
registered by the petitioner. It was further asserted that having come to 
know about the registration of the GPA, the petitioner procured cancellation 
thereof on 13.07.1998 and since the respondent was illegally retaining the 
rented premises without payment of rent; the petitioner, on 23.09.1999, 
filed ejectment petition. The respondent contested the application by filing 
the reply and denied the relationship of landlord and tenant and claimed 
ownership of the rented premises on the strength of the agreement qua the 
sale-part thereof. The ejectment petition was dismissed, vide order dated 
01.06.2009 against which an appeal was preferred by the petitioner that also 
met the same fate, vide order dated 03.05.2016, hence, the present 
constitutional petition.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the learned Courts 
below have failed to appreciate that when the ownership of the petitioner 
was admitted by the respondent who had not been able to prove the 
payment of entire sale price in accordance with the agreement, in such 
situation the respondent was required to prove his title, which the 
respondent miserably failed to do as his right of evidence was closed and he 
ought to have been regarded as a tenant, under the agreement and therefore, 
decision of the learned Rent Controller upheld by the learned Appellate 
Court below is based on mere assumptions and conjectures.  
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent has supported the 
impugned findings with the averments that the original documents of the 
rented premises were produced by the respondent, which were handed over 
to him by the petitioner, after receipt of the balance sale price albeit after 
the due date agreed under the agreement, and this fact alone establishes that 

3 
W.P. No.22949 of 2016 
 
 
the petitioner sold the rented premises and there is no relationship of 
landlord and tenant between the parties. 
4. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
5. 
The factual matrix of the case leads to the formulation of following 
questions that are required to be adjudicated upon by this Court: 
i. 
Whether the rent clause contained in the agreement is an 
independent and stand-alone contract, severable from the rest 
of the agreement, and the same could be considered to have 
survived after failure on part of the respondent to fulfil the 
condition of payment of balance sale price, before the cut-off 
date i.e., 30.03.1995?  
ii. 
Whether the jurisdiction exercised by the learned Courts 
below, under the West Pakistan Urban Rent Restriction 
Ordinance, 1959 (“the Ordinance”), could have been 
extended in aid of a person/tenant in occupation of the rented 
premises by permitting him to establish and prove the payment 
of outstanding sale price pursuant to the agreement (of sale) 
even though the suit for specific performance, instituted by 
such person/tenant, on the basis of the agreement had been 
dismissed by the competent Court?  
6. 
Before answering the above referred questions, it will be 
advantageous to examine the contents of the agreement that read as

Both the learned Courts below have interpreted the agreement to 
have created a tenancy only for a period of three months ending on 
30.03.1995, and treated the acknowledgement of payment of the balance 
payment at the reverse/back side of the first page of the agreement to be 
valid discharge of obligation by the respondent to pay the balance price, 
under the agreement, albeit after the stipulated period of time while holding 

5 
W.P. No.22949 of 2016 
 
 
that the parties agreed to the extension in cut-off due date. A meticulous 
examination of the agreement reveals that the agreement is unique in 
nature. It has three significant parts. First part of the agreement indicates 
that the parties had agreed to sell the rented premises for total consideration 
of Rs.325,000/- out of which an amount of Rs. 100,000/- was paid as 
earnest money by the respondent to the petitioner and the balance amount 
was to be paid by or before stipulated date i.e., 30.03.1995. Admittedly, the 
needful was not done by the respondent and the payment was not made on 
or before 30.03.1995. Whereas second part of the agreement is the effect of 
such breach, which contemplates that in case of failure on part of the 
respondent to pay the balance amount of the consideration, the earnest 
amount will be confiscated and that the transaction (of sale) shall be 
deemed to have been rescinded. Third part is the stipulation that till 
30.03.1995, the respondent will pay rent to the petitioner. Meaning thereby 
that till the cut-off date that had been fixed for payment of the balance 
consideration, the nature of relationship between the parties was that of the 
landlord and the tenant and the moment the said due date expired and the 
respondent admittedly failed to pay the balance consideration, the 
agreement envisaging sale, between the parties, automatically stood 
rescinded and the respondent continued to hold the possession as tenant 
albeit, under an oral tenancy, on the basis of doctrine of holding over. It is 
pertinent to observe that no overt or covert was required on part of the 
petitioner to get sale-part of the agreement rescinded or cancelled. At this 
juncture, it is imperative to mention that the ejectment petition was filed 
under the Ordinance (since repealed), which did not envisage expiry of term 
of tenancy as a ground of eviction and the petitioner was obligated to prove 
default or any other ground of ejectment envisaged under the Ordinance. 
Therefore, the ejectment petition was rightly filed on ground of default in 
payment of rent. The respondent had taken the stance that in-fact he paid 
the balance consideration after the expiry of the stipulated date i.e., 
30.03.1995 as the said date was extended with mutual consent of the parties 

6 
W.P. No.22949 of 2016 
 
 
and the petitioner received the amount and acknowledgment thereof was 
recorded on the reverse/back side of the agreement, therefore, there was no 
need to pay the rent and the learned Rent Controller as well as the learned 
Appellate Court below accepted the said stance. The learned Appellate 
Court below held as under: 
 
“12.  It was emphatically argued that the respondent had 
failed to perform his part of the agreement therefore, he was 
not entitled to retain the possession of the demised premises 
being defaulter in payment of rent as he admitted the 
relationship of landlord and tenant in written reply and even 
before Hon'ble Lahore High Court, Lahore and that an 
agreement to sell does not create an estoppel against the 
right of the landlord. This argument would have of much 
weight and substance if there had been any independent 
rent agreement between the parties but the appellant has 
derived his alleged claim of landlord on the basis of sale 
agreement Ex-R-1 which otherwise was an alternate 
arrangement made by the parties in execution of the 
agreement just to claim the tenancy rent amount for that 
specific period of two months by which respondent was put 
into possession in the demised property under the agreement 
to sell. I have also gone through the alleged admissions 
pointed out by learned counsel for the appellant but could 
not sway myself to accede to this argument because 
respondent though admitted the execution of agreement yet 
he explained there that alleged tenancy had terminated after 
the payment of sale consideration and with this explanation, 
alleged admissions have become insignificant for proving 
the case of appellant. Therefore, argument of the learned 
counsel for the appellant has not been substantiated by the 
record. 
       (Emphasis supplied) 
The learned Rent Controller as well as the learned Appellate Court below 
erred in interpretation of the agreement between the parties that comprises 
of two different transactions. This Court is of the opinion that the rent 
clause contained in the agreement is an independent and stand-alone 
contract severable from the rest of the agreement and the same survived 
after failure on part of the respondent to fulfil the condition of payment of 

7 
W.P. No.22949 of 2016 
 
 
balance sale price, before the cut-off date i.e., 30.03.1995. The contracts 
have their own canons and principles for their construction. Principle of 
severance/severability of a contract is well-entrenched under the law of 
contract. The doctrine implies that there are contracts within a contract in 
the form of particular clause, which survive the frustration and/or the 
determination/rescission of the main contract. This principle is also known 
as principle of separability and is well established. In this regard, case 
reported as “Hitachi Limited and another vs Rupali Polyester and others.” 
(1998 SCMR 1618) is referred.  
8. 
Perusal of the agreement reproduced above reveals that the 
agreement was couched by the parties in a manner that the same could be 
severed into two independent and separate agreements one of which 
pertained to sale of the rented premises that specifically contains that the 
possession shall be handed over at the time of mutation of the rented 
premises by stipulating that “۔"ہضبق ب  روز یلقتنم دنکا اجاگیئ. This is followed by the clause 
whereby it had been agreed that the possession of the rented premises is 
being handed over to the respondent on rent, which shall be paid till the 
completion of the remainder of the contract that is in the nature of 
agreement to sell. The remainder of the contract could not be performed for 
rhymes and reasons that would be unnecessary to dilate upon in the present 
proceedings. However, the ineluctable position is that the suit of the 
respondent for specific performance failed. The possession under the 
agreement, as per contractual stipulations, was to be handed over on the 
date and day of mutation which never took place. Time was certainly 
essence of the contract and admittedly payment of balance sale price was 
not made by the respondent on or before the cut-off date. Since the 
respondent failed to meet the cut-off date, as a natural corollary, he 
continued to hold the possession of the rented premises, under the terms of 
the agreement, which though forms second part of the agreement but, in 
essence, is an autonomous and separable agreement creating oral tenancy, 
under the Ordinance. Therefore, it was not appropriate for the learned Rent 

8 
W.P. No.22949 of 2016 
 
 
Controller to cherry-pick parts of the contract and overlook the others. The 
respondent took over the possession of the rented premises as a tenant, 
under the agreement, and cannot take volte-face from the stipulations of the 
agreement in this regard including automatic rescission of the agreement, to 
the extent of sale, upon failure on part of the respondent to meet the cut-off 
date.     
9. 
It is also imperative to note that the respondent instituted a suit for 
specific performance of the agreement, which was dismissed but the 
dismissal was not assailed before the appellate forum, hence, the said order 
attained finality. Perusal of the order of dismissal of the suit (Ex.A-2) 
reveals that the suit of the respondent was dismissed on 03.05.1995 and the 
contents of the reverse/back side of agreement has been taken as an 
extension in time for performance of the agreement, by the learned Courts 
below to draw the conclusion that the petitioner himself extended the date 
of performance of the agreement after receipt of Rs. 100,000/- on 
05.04.1995 and then received the balance sale consideration of Rs.125,000/- 
on 02.05.1995 and these dates of payment manifestly establish the amicable 
resolution of dispute, so there was no reason for the respondent to challenge 
the order of dismissal of his suit for specific performance of contract. The 
conclusion is erroneous inasmuch as while exercising jurisdiction under 
rent law, the learned fora below extended an opportunity to the respondent 
to establish and prove the outstanding payment of sale consideration 
pursuant to the agreement that is not covered under the object of the 
Ordinance, more so when the suit for specific performance on the basis of 
the agreement had been dismissed by the competent Court. The learned 
Rent Controller as well as the learned Appellate Court below appear to have 
been impressed by the endorsements on the reverse/back side of the 
agreement, which by itself cannot be a circumstance that establishes the 
receipt of any money, more particularly, when the said endorsements have 
not been recorded in accordance with the dictates of Qanun-e-Shahadat 
Order, 1984 („QSO‟). No doubt that the learned Rent Controller was 

9 
W.P. No.22949 of 2016 
 
 
entitled to hold an inquiry into question of title in case of eviction, however, 
when the matter involved a complexity such as the one in hand, requiring 
interpretation of the agreement having dual characteristics involving issue 
related to specific performance thereof, unless the same is proved in 
accordance with Article 17 read with 79 of the QSO, before the Court of 
plenary jurisdiction, the respondent could not deny the relationship of 
landlord and tenant. Learned Rent Controller has erroneously allowed the 
respondent 
to 
take 
benefit 
of 
the 
purported 
endorsements/ 
acknowledgements recorded on the reverse/back side of the agreement. At 
this juncture, before analysing whether the reasons recorded by the learned 
Courts below in general and that of the learned Appellate Court below in 
particular are cogent and sustainable in the eye of law, it will be 
advantageous to reproduce the two endorsements/acknowledgments, of 
payment, recorded on the reverse/back side of the agreement that reads as 
under:

"
  
Both the learned Courts below have erred in drawing the conclusion that the 
tenancy between the parties expired since the balance sale consideration 
had been paid after the due date, with mutual consent inasmuch as the 
above quoted endorsements/acknowledgments do not refer the name of any 
witnesses in whose presence the purported balance sale consideration was 
paid and the same have been taken as a gospel truth. Whereas there is no 

10 
W.P. No.22949 of 2016 
 
 
denial that at the outset of his induction in the rented premises, the 
respondent was a tenant and it is settled principle of law that once a tenant 
is always a tenant. The status of the respondent as a tenant was to continue 
as such till the transformation of the same into an owner, had the sale-part 
of the agreement been completed and executed in letter and spirit, which 
was admittedly not taken to its logical conclusion or proved in accordance 
with law before a Court of competent jurisdiction, therefore, the learned 
Rent Controller had no power to draw such conclusion. Moreover, even if it 
is assumed that learned Rent Controller had power to conduct the inquiry 
allowing the respondent to prove the payment of balance price, which the 
learned Rent Controller had not, question arises who were the witnesses of 
such endorsements/ acknowledgments reflecting payment beyond cut-off 
date as  no such witnesses were produced. Hence, it can easily be inferred 
that the respondent, having admitted ownership of the petitioner as well as 
initial tenancy failed to prove the payment of balance sale price as agreed 
and  the status of the respondent never underwent any transformation and 
remained as a tenant. Much emphasis has been laid by learned counsel for 
the respondent that mere presence of the original title documents of the 
rented premises in custody of the respondent in itself substantiates the 
stance of the respondent that he cleared full payment under the agreement 
and received the said documents. The said argument too is misconceived as 
presence of the title documents does not get traction from anything in 
writing, either in the agreement or even through the endorsements/ 
acknowledgments at the reverse/back side thereof or through any other 
independent instrument that the original documents were lawfully obtained 
by the respondent, pursuant to completion of the sale under the agreement, 
whereas it has not been denied by the respondent that the GPA stood 
cancelled and criminal complaint was also filed against the respondent for 
committing forgery and use of force against the petitioner. Suffice to 
observe that the purpose and object of the Ordinance, which is erstwhile 
legislation governing relationship of landlord and tenant, was to        

11 
W.P. No.22949 of 2016 
 
 
provide machinery for ejectment of tenants and other ancillary matters and 
the learned Rent Controller functioning thereunder had no authority to hold 
that a tenancy agreement coupled with stipulation of sale was specifically 
performed and the respondent is to be treated as a buyer simply because of 
the presence of original title document of the rented premises with the 
respondent and by doing so the learned Rent Controller erroneously 
assumed jurisdiction of a Civil Court, passing a decree of specific 
performance by concluding that the agreement stood specifically performed 
between the parties, more so when there is no supporting evidence on 
record.  
10. 
In view of the above, this constitutional petition is allowed and the 
impugned findings of the learned Courts below are set aside. As a natural 
corollary, the eviction petition filed by the petitioner is accepted and the 
respondent is liable to forthwith eviction from the rented premises.
