Versus 
The Registrar, Lahore High Court, Lahore  
 
J U D G M E N T 
 
Date of hearing:     08.11.2024. 
Appellant by: 
Appellant in person. 
 
Respondent by: 
Mr. Jawwad Tariq Nasim, Advocate. 
  
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J./CHAIRMAN:-
Through instant appeal, appellant has assailed Notification 
dated 21.04.2017 and order dated 11.10.2017, passed by 
respondent, whereby in pursuance to disciplinary proceedings 
appellant was awarded minor penalties of withholding of one 
increment & withholding of promotion in next grade and post 
for a period of six months from due date and his review / 
representation was also declined. 
2.  
Brief facts are that vide Charge Sheet dated 15.11.2016, 
appellant was confronted with the following charges:- 
1. 
That you while being posted as Civil Judge, Class-II, at 
Jaranwala, 
District 
Faisalabad, 
committed 
following 
irregularities / illegalities:- 
(i) 
While dealing with execution petition under the title “Inayat 
Ali and other versus Muhammad Iqbal” you for the purpose 
of giving illegal monetary benefits to Inayat Ali and 
Muqqadas Rani, the execution petitioners, dismissed the 
petition u/s 151 CPC by Muhammad Zahid (brother of 
husband of present complainant) with the prayer that warrant 
of possession, not to be issued upon the request of Inayat Ali 
and Muqqadas Rani, as property No.1 consist upon shops, 
was decreed in his favour while wrongly considering the said 
petition by Muhammad Zahid to be the petitioner, filed by 
Muhammad Iqbal. 
(ii) 
While dealing with the above said execution petition, you 
issued warrant of possession upon the request of Inayat Ali 

 
Service Appeal No.01 of 2018 
2
and Muqqadas Rani, for next date in execution petition 
15.02.2014 and in warrant of possession, the description of 
property was mentioned, a house in Khewat No.1291, 
Khatuni No.1777, but inn warrant of possession in said 
execution petition, dated 28.03.2015, contrary to first warrant 
of possession, to benefit monetary, execution petitioners, 
wrongly mentioned the description of property, a house and 
shops without the strength of decree and pray in execution 
petition or any valid court order and the warrant of 
possession dated 28.03.2015 was partly enforced / complied 
with through Bailiff and occupant was partially dispossessed. 
 
2. 
By reasons of the above you appear to be: 
 
(a) 
inefficient within the meaning of rule 3(a) of the 
Punjab Civil Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 1999 
and/or 
 
(b) 
guilty of misconduct within the meaning of rule 2(1)(c) 
and 3(b) of the Punjab Civil Servants (Efficiency and 
Discipline) Rules, 1999 
 
and as such, is of one or more of the penalties prescribed by 
rule 4 of the liable to disciplinary action under the Punjab 
Civil Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 1999, which 
may include imposition said rules.” 
Appellant filed reply to the charge sheet by denying the 
allegations. After recording of evidence, Inquiry Officer 
submitted its report recommending minor penalties of 
withholding one increment and withholding of promotion in 
next grade and post for a period of six months under sub-Rule 
(1) Part (a) of Rule 4 of the Punjab Civil Servants (Efficiency & 
Discipline) Rules, 1999. Inquiry Officer issued show cause 
notice along with copy of the report requiring explanation from 
appellant as to why recommended penalty may not be imposed 
against him. Appellant tendered reply, however the same was 
found unsatisfactory. Resultantly, aforesaid penalties were 
imposed vide Notification dated 21.04.2017. Feeling aggrieved, 
appellant filed review / departmental representation, which was 
also dismissed vide order dated 11.10.2017. Hence, this appeal. 
3. 
Appellant in person, with permission of this Tribunal, 
submits that wrong exercise of jurisdiction by a Judicial Officer 
cannot always become basis for initiation of disciplinary 
proceedings, which even otherwise does not cast doubt on the 
integrity of a Judicial Officer. Further submits that no 

 
Service Appeal No.01 of 2018 
3
extraneous consideration on the part of appellant has been 
established during inquiry proceedings. Argues that as per Rule 
4(1)(a)(ii) of the Punjab Civil Servants (Efficiency & 
Discipline) Rules, 1999, promotion & increment could not have 
been withheld simultaneously. He has relied upon Sardar 
Muhammad Zaman Khan, Director of Military Lands and 
Contonments, G.H.Q. Rawalpindi and others v. M.B. Nishat 
and others (PLD 1962 Supreme Court 22), Mrs. Anisa 
Rehman v. P.I.A.C. and another (1994 SCMR 2232) and 
Muhammad Sharif and others v. MCB Bank Limited and others 
(2021 SCMR 1158). 
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for respondent submits that 
appellant, in para 3 of the appeal, has admitted the irregularities 
committed by him, which amounts to inefficiency and gross 
negligence. He adds that the charges leveled against appellant 
were proved through inquiry, which was finalized after 
affording full opportunity to appellant to lead his defence and 
principles of natural justice coupled with other legal & 
procedural formalities were also observed. He argues that Rule 
4 of the Punjab Civil Servants (Efficiency & Discipline) Rules, 
1999, does not prohibit to award more than one minor penalties 
and narrow interpretation of the said provisions construed by 
learned counsel for appellant is against the intent of the 
legislature.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused.  
6. 
Brief factual background of the case which formed basis 
for initiation of inquiry proceedings against appellant was that 
during pendency of Execution Petition titled Anayat Ali etc. v. 
Muhammad Iqbal, an application was moved by one 
Muhammad Zahid, praying cancellation of warrant of 
possession in respect of one house and restoration of possession 
of two shops, however the said application was dismissed by 
appellant. Resultantly, the decree was satisfied and execution 
petition was consigned to record. The said order was assailed 
before learned Appellate Court, whereby the matter was 

 
Service Appeal No.01 of 2018 
4
remanded for decision afresh after recording evidence of the 
parties vide judgment dated 08.06.2015. In post-remand 
proceedings, successor of appellant (Mr. Muhammad Afzal 
Hanjra, Civil Judge Ist Class, Jaranwala) dismissed the 
aforesaid application vide order dated 31.10.2019 (as was done 
by appellant). However, it is not presented before us that the 
order dated 31.10.2019 was further assailed by the aggrieved 
party.  
7. 
It is needless to observe here that Judicial Officers enjoy 
a degree of immunity for actions taken in the course of their 
official duties under the Judicial Officers Protection Act, 1850. 
However, this immunity is not absolute, particularly in cases 
involving acts of mala fide intention or gross negligence. A 
Judicial Officer, while hearing a case, is at liberty to decide the 
matter by applying the law to the facts based on the available 
record. A decision passed by any Judge may ultimately turn out 
to be incorrect and be set aside by a higher judicial forum. 
However, the erroneous exercise of judicial power, resulting in 
an order based on an incorrect application of the law, cannot 
and should not cast doubt on the integrity of the Judicial 
Officer. The quality of a judgment or order passed by a Judicial 
Officer can only be properly assessed in appellate judicial 
proceedings 
and, 
ordinarily, 
not 
through 
disciplinary 
proceedings, unless extraneous factors that influenced the 
judgment or order are proven with cogent material presented 
before the inquiry officer. The inquiry officer or hearing officer 
conducting disciplinary proceedings cannot act as an appellate 
or revisional forum over the judgments or orders passed by the 
Judicial Officer. The judicial independence of the subordinate 
judiciary must be respected and safeguarded at all costs. The 
inquiry officer or hearing officer must proceed with extreme 
caution in such matters, as any overreach would have a chilling 
effect on the functioning of the subordinate judiciary, impeding 
its ability to perform judicial functions freely and fairly. 
Reference can be made to Hasnain Raza and another v. 

 
Service Appeal No.01 of 2018

Lahore High Court, Lahore and others” (PLD 2022 Supreme 
Court 7), Ishwar Chand Jain v. High Court of Punjab & 
Haryana (AIR 1988 SC 1395) and K.P. Tiwari v. State of 
Madhya Pradesh (AIR 1994 SC 1031). The observation of the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Hasnain Raza, supra are 
reproduced hereunder:- 
“4.  
The District Judiciary is the backbone of our judicial 
system, and the judges of the District Judiciary perform the 
onerous task of dispensing justice at the frontline by dealing 
with a large number of cases in a difficult and demanding 
environment. The judges of the higher courts must 
appreciate the stressful and challenging conditions in which 
these judges perform. Our judicial system acknowledges the 
fallibility of the judges, and hence provides for appeals and 
revisions. Higher courts everyday come across orders of 
the lower courts which are not justified either in law or in 
fact and modify or set them aside; that is the function of 
an appellate court. It is often said that a judge who has not 
committed an error is yet to be born. This applies to all 
judges, no matter how high or low in rank they may be….” 
 
 
In a judgment reported as Rao Abdul Jabbar Khan v. 
Registrar, Lahore High Court, Lahore [2016 PLC (C.S.) 281], 
this Court held that in the absence of any evidence it will not be 
fair to suggest that bail cancellation order passed by the Judicial 
Officer was based on malice and that malice cannot be 
presumed on the basis of surmises and conjectures. 
 
8. 
In the present case, there is no supporting material to 
establish any extraneous considerations on the part of the 
appellant in passing the order that is the subject matter of the 
inquiry. The impugned order was passed on allegations of 
inefficiency and misconduct, but in our view, these allegations 
were 
not 
substantiated during the 
inquiry, 
especially 
considering the similar order passed by the appellant's 
successor, which has attained finality. 
 
9. 
The next pivotal question is whether minor penalties i.e. 
withholding of increment and withholding of promotion, 
provided in Rule 4(1)(a)(ii) of the Punjab Civil Servants 
(Efficiency & Discipline) Rules, 1999, could have been imposed 
against appellant simultaneously. Rule 3 of the Punjab Civil 
Servants (Efficiency & Discipline) Rules, 1999 provides details 

 
Service Appeal No.01 of 2018 
6
of the grounds for imposing penalty against a civil servant and 
states that one or more of the penalties hereinafter mentioned 
may be imposed on him. Rule 4 mentions the kinds of penalties, 
which reads as under:- 
 
4. 
Penalties. (1) The following are the penalties namely – 
 
(a) 
Minor Penalties:-- 
 
 
(i) 
censure; 
(ii) 
withholding, for a specific period, promotion or 
increment, otherwise than for unfitness for promotion 
or financial advancement in accordance with the 
rules or orders pertaining to the service or post; 
(b) 
Major Penalties:-- 
(i) 
reduction to a lower post or pay-scale or to a lower 
stage in a pay-scale; 
(ii) 
recovery of the whole or any part of any pecuniary 
loss caused to Government by negligence or breach 
of orders; 
(iii) 
compulsory retirement; 
(iv) 
removal from service; and  
(v) 
dismissal from service. 
 
From the combined reading of Rules 3 & 4 it is clear 
without any doubt that more than one penalties, mentioned 
supra, can be imposed against a civil servant. We are also 
fortified from a judgment of Hon’ble Apex Court reported as 
The Secretary to Government of the Punjab v. Shaukat Jameel 
(1990 SCMR 193), wherein the respondent was proceeded 
against the Punjab Civil Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) 
Rules, 1975 [prevalent at that time and its Rules 3 & 4 were 
analogous to Rules 3 & 4 of the Punjab Civil Servants 
(Efficiency & Discipline) Rules, 1999] and awarded two minor 
penalties of ‘censure' and ‘stoppage of two increments 
without cumulative effect' on account of his unauthorized 
absence from duty. However, the decision of the department 
was turned down by the Punjab Service Tribunal, Lahore, but 
the Hon’ble Apex Court restored the decision of awarding two 
minor penalties, referred supra. From Indian jurisdiction, we 
have also found Rule 8 of the Karnataka Civil Services 
(Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1957 to be alike to 

 
Service Appeal No.01 of 2018 
7
Rule 3 of the Punjab Civil Servants (Efficiency & Discipline) 
Rules, 1999 to extent of permitting imposition of more than one 
penalty.1  
10. 
However, we are mindful of the fact that interpretation of 
the word ‘or’ is context sensitive and can fluctuate between a 
disjunctive and conjunctive meaning, depending on the 
legislative or legal context and intent. Generally, ‘or’ serves as 
a disjunctive term, offering alternatives such as ‘either one or 
the other but not both’. However, it can sometimes be 
construed as conjunctive (similar to ‘and’) to prevent absurd, 
unintended consequences in legal interpretation and where the 
disjunctive reading would disrupt legislative objectives. We are 
fortified from the dicta laid down by the Hon’ble superior 
Courts in Pakistan in a number of cases.2 
 
In 
Messrs 
Pakistan 
Services 
Ltd., 
Karachi 
v. 
Commissioner of Income-Tax, Central Zone 'C' (COS-1), 
Karachi  (1999 PTD 2901), the Singh High Court while 
interpreting the word ‘or’ appearing between the terms ‘bonus’ 
and ‘commission’ appearing in Explanation (i) to Section 24(i) 
of the Repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979, termed the same 
as disjunctive. In the case reported as Dr. Anjum Syed v. 
Federal Public Service Commission through Chairman, 
Islamabad and 3 others [2005 PLC (C.S.) 138], this Court held 
that ‘or’ used in various qualifications appearing in the 
advertisement for recruitment of various posts is disjunctive, 
 
1 8. Nature of penalties.- One or more of the following penalties for good and sufficient reasons and as 
hereinafter provided, may be imposed on Government servants, namely.-  
(i) 
Fine in the case of Government servants belonging to State Civil Services, Group-D; 1. Omitted by 
Notification No. GAD 50 SSR 74 (GSR No. 265) dated 2-9-1975 w.e.f. 18-9- 1975.  
(ii) 
Censure;   
(iii) 
"Withholding of increments;  
(iii-a)      Withholding of promotion" 
(iv) 
…. 
(iv-a) 
(v) 
…. 
(vi) 
…. 
(vii)

2 Salehon and others v. The State  (PLD 1969 Supreme Court 267), Khadim Hussain and another v. The Additional 
District Judge, Faisalabad and others (PLD 1990 Supreme Court 632), Syed Mehmood Akhtar Naqvi v. Federation of 
Pakistan through Secretary Law and others (PLD 2012 Supreme Court 1054), Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari and 37 
others v. Sh. Muhammad Rashid, Chairman, Federal Land Commission and another (PLD 1981 Lahore 159), Ch. 
Zulfiqar ali v. Chairman, NAB and others (PLD 2003 Lahore 593) and Dr. Anjum Syed vs Federal Public Service 
Commission through Chairman, Islamabad and 3 others (2007 P L C (C.S.) 1035 Lahore).

meaning that each qualification would stand alone rather than 
requiring all criteria simultaneously. In case reported as 
Commissioner Inland Revenue, Legal Zone, LTO, Multan Vs. 
Messrs Usman Trader Linkers, Multan (2023 PTD 679), this 
Court has observed as under:- 
“8….. It is cardinal principle of interpretation that in legislative 
instruments / provisions, the word "or" is employed in the 
disjunctive sense (means it separates things) and word "and" in, 
conjunctive sense (means it combines things). Though in certain 
cases, the words "and" and "or" may be interchangeable, 
however course of action is only permissible in order to give 
effect to the clear and obvious intention of the legislature or to 
avoid s absurdity, unreasonableness or redundancy. It is also 
established that while construing a statute / legal provision, no 
part of same or word used therein shall be superfluous. Every 
word has to be taken into account and meaning is to be given to 
the same. The Courts always presume that every word and 
expression used by legislature has a purpose and intent. No 
provision of an enactment can be treated as redundant or surplus 
and has to be given its meaning and effect. It is well-settled that 
while interpreting taxing statutes, if there is any doubt or 
ambiguity in the language used in the statute which rendered 
same capable of several interpretations, then the interpretation 
favourable to the assessee is to be adopted.” 
 
The above interpretation is quite recognized by the 
Indian3 and British Courts.4  
11. 
Having discussed the matter above, we are of the candid 
opinion that the word ‘or’ appearing in Rule 4(1)(a)(ii) of the 
Punjab Civil Servants (Efficiency & Discipline) Rules, 1999, 
particularly regarding the penalties of withholding an 
increment or promotion, be termed as disjunctive. This means 
that only one minor penalty (either withholding of increment or 
withholding of promotion) should be awarded at a time, rather 
than combining both penalties. Needless to add that in Indian 
jurisdiction, The Central Civil Services (Classification, Control 
and Appeal) Rules, 1965,5 U.P. Government Servant 
(Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1999,6 The Maharashtra Civil 
 
3 Sukhnandan v. Suraj Bali (AIR 1951 All. 119), American Home Products Corpn.v. Mac Laboratories (P) Ltd. (AIR 
1986 SC 137), Kamal Kumar Agarwal  v. Union of India (2004 (171) ELT301(CAL) and Durrani Abdullah Khan v. The 
State Of Maharashtra and Others (AIR 2017 BOMBAY 150).

Services UK Ltd [2017] EWCA Civ 2196. 
5 See Rule 11, clauses (ii) & (iv). 
6 See Rule 3, clauses (ii-withholding of increments for a specified period) & (iii- stoppage at an efficiency bar, 
however withholding of promotion is not provided). 

 
Service Appeal No.01 of 2018

Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 19797 and Karnataka 
Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 
1957,8 provide penalties of ‘withholding of increments’ and 
‘withholding of promotion’ separately under different clauses.   
12. 
For the foregoing reasons, the instant appeal is allowed 
and the orders imposing the minor penalties of withholding one 
increment and withholding promotion to the next grade and post 
for a period of six months from the due date, as well as the order 
dismissing the review/representation, are hereby set aside.
