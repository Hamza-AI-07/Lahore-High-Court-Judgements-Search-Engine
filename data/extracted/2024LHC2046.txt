(ON COURT’S CALL).  
 
 
 
Through this Constitutional Petition, filed under 
Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973, petitioners have called into question the 
vires, validity and legality of conclusion of sunset 
review dated 30.08.2022 and notice dated 31.08.2022 
whereby the National Tariff Commission (The 
Commission) while deciding the review decided to 
continue definitive Anti-Dumping Duties for another 
period of 05-years w.e.f. February 08, 2022.  
2. 
Facts in brevity are that an application under 
Section 20 & 24 of the Anti-Dumping Duties Act, 2015 
(The Act) was received by the Commission on 
29.06.2015 from M/s International Steel Limited, 
Karachi, with the allegation that galvanized coils and 
sheets are being imported to Pakistan at dumped prices 
from the People Republic of China and said import has 
caused and is threatening to cause material injury to the 
domestic industry. After receipt of the said application, 
notice of initiating of Anti-Dumping Investigation of 
galvanized coils and sheets was issued on 11.08.2015; 
that the Commission after conducting the Anti-
Dumping Investigation, issued a final determination 

W.P. No. 26907 of 2024. 
2
notice dated 08.02.2017 for imposition of definitive 
Anti-Dumping Duty on dumped imports of galvanized 
coils and sheets; that the Commission issued notice 
dated 25.10.2021 with regard to impending expiry of 
Anti-Dumping Duties by notifying that the Definitive 
Anti-Dumping Duties levied on dumped import of 
galvanized coils and sheets shall be terminated on 
08.02.2022; that an application under Section 58(3) of 
the Act was moved to the Commission on 15.12.2021 
from M/S International Steel Limited, Karachi and M/s 
Ayesha Steel Mills, Karachi for sunset review of Anti-
Dumping Duties levied on dumped import of 
galvanized coils and sheets into Pakistan; that the 
Commission conducted the proceedings of the sunset 
review and vide order dated 30.08.2022 decided that 
there is a need to continue imposition of Definitive 
Anti-Dumping Duties on dumped imports of product 
under review from China as per specific rates 
mentioned in the decision for another period of 05 years 
w.e.f. 08.02.2022; that in this regard a notice dated 
31.08.2022 was also issued. Being dissatisfied, 
petitioners have filed instant Constitutional Petition by 
challenging the decision of said sunset review and 
notice.  
3. 
Preliminary arguments are heard. Record perused.  
4. 
The main objection raised by the learned counsel 
for the petitioners is with regard to the constitution of 
the Commission who decided the said review. He 
maintains that as per Section 4 of the National Tariff 
Commission Act, 2015, it is provided that the 
Commission shall comprise of five members, appointed 
by the Federal Government in the prescribed manner 
but the impugned decision of sun set review is passed 
by a three Member Commission, hence, the same is not 

W.P. No. 26907 of 2024. 
3
sustainable in the eyes of law. For ease Section 4 of the 
Act ibid is reproduced as under:- 
“4. Constitution of the Commission.—(1) The 
Commission shall comprise five members, 
appointed by the Federal Government in the 
prescribed manner. The Federal Government 
shall appoint one of the members to be Chairman 
of the Commission. 
(2) 
The Commission shall be body corporate 
having perpetual succession and a common seal. 
It shall have the authority and duty to exercise the 
functions assigned to it by or pursuant to this Act 
or any other law for the time being in force, shall 
have the power and authority to acquire, hold and 
dispose 
of 
property, 
both 
movable 
and 
immovable, in its own name, shall have the 
power and authority to open a personal ledger 
account in its own name and may sue and be sued 
in its own name. 
(3) 
The head office of the Commission shall be 
at Islamabad and the Commission may establish 
offices at such places as it may deem necessary. 
(4) 
  No act, proceedings or decision of the 
Commission shall be invalid by reason only of 
the existence of a vacancy or defect in the 
Constitution of Commission. 
 
In this regard, it is observed that Sub-Section 04 of the 
Section 04 of the Act ibid reflects that no act, 
proceeding or decision of the Commission shall be 
invalidated by reason of only of the existence of a 
vacancy or defect in the Constitution of the Commission. 
In this view of the matter, this objection taken by the 
learned counsel for the petitioners is not tenable.  
5. 
     It is observed that the statute has provided a 
remedy of appeal under Section 70 of the Anti Dumping 
Duties Act, 2015.  Before further discussion, it is better 
to see Section 70 of the Act ibid which reads as under: 
70. Appellate procedures.—(1) Any interested party 
may prefer an appeal to the Appellate 
Tribunal against— 
(i) the initiation of an investigation or a preliminary 
determination, where it is alleged that it does not 
satisfy the requirements laid down in sections 23 and 
37 respectively; 

W.P. No. 26907 of 2024. 
4
(ii) an affirmative or negative final determination by 
the Commission under section 39; 
(iii) any final determination pursuant to a review; 
(iv) an order of the Commission for termination of 
investigation under Section 41; or 
(v) a determination of the Commission under section 
52. 
(2) An appeal under clause (i) of subsection (1) shall 
be filed within thirty days of the publication of notice 
of initiation or notice preliminary determination, as the 
case may be. 
 
(3) The Appellate Tribunal shall handle such an appeal 
as a priority and shall issue its decision on the appeal 
within thirty days of the filing of an appeal with the 
Appellate Tribunal:  
 
Provided that the filing of an appeal under clause (i) of 
subsection 
(1) 
shall 
have 
no 
effect 
on 
the 
Commission’s conduct of investigation. 
 
(4) All appeals under clauses (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) of 
subsection (1) shall be filed within forty-five days 
from the date of publication in newspapers of a public 
notice or as the case may be, date of the decision of the 
Commission of any affirmative or negative final 
decision 
or 
determination 
or 
termination 
of 
investigation by the Commission, and shall be in such 
form and contain such information as may be 
prescribed. 
 
(5) Such an appeal shall be disposed of and the 
decision of the Appellate Tribunal pronounced, as 
expeditiously as possible as but not later than forty-
five days from the date of receipt of an appeal 
compliant with the requirements contained in this Act. 
 
(6) The Appellate Tribunal shall hear the appeal from 
day-to-day.  
 
(7) In examining an appeal under subsection (1), the 
Appellate Tribunal may make such further inquiry as it 
may consider necessary, and after giving the 
Commission and an appellant an opportunity of being 
heard, pass such order as it thinks fit, confirming, 
altering 
or 
annulling 
a 
determination 
of 
the 
Commission appealed against:  
 
Provided that in case the Appellate Tribunal decision 
requires action by the Commission, it shall remand the 
case to the Commission. 
 
(8) After examining the appeal, the Appellate tribunal 
shall assess the facts related to the impugned 
determination of the Commission. The Appellate 
Tribunal shall determine whether the establishment of 
the facts of the Commission was proper and whether 

W.P. No. 26907 of 2024. 
5
the commission’s evaluation of those facts was 
unbiased and objective. The Appellate tribunal shall 
base this determination on the official record 
maintained by the Commission or any other 
documents relied upon by the Commission in reaching 
the determination being appealed. 
 
(9) Where the Appellate Tribunal determines that the 
Commission’s establishment of the facts was proper 
and its evaluation was unbiased and objective, it shall 
confirm the appealed determination of the Commission 
provided that the Appellate Tribunal is satisfied that in 
reaching its determination, the Commission complied 
with the relevant provisions of this Act. 
 
(10) The decision of the Appellate Tribunal shall be in 
writing, detailing the issues raised in the appeal and 
the arguments adopted by the appellant and the 
Commission. The Appellate tribunal shall also provide 
reasons for reaching its decision with reference to the 
provisions of this Act and the facts of the case. 
 
(11) The Appellate Tribunal shall provide copies of its 
decision to all the appellants and the respondents 
including the Commission no later than five days from 
the date of rendering its decision. 
 
(12) The Appellate Tribunal may, if it deems 
necessary, require an appellant to provide security in 
such form as may be prescribed, at the time of filing of 
an appeal. 
 
(13) The decision of the Appellate Tribunal shall be 
appealable in the High Court. The High Court shall 
render a decision within ninety days of receiving an 
appeal from the decision of the Appellate Tribunal: 
 
Provided that the High Court shall not make an interim 
order against the conduct of investigation by the 
Commission unless the Commission has been given 
notice of the application and has had an opportunity of 
being heard and the High Court, for reasons to be 
recorded in writing, is satisfied that the interim order 
would not have the effect of prejudicing or interfering 
with the carrying out of a public work or of otherwise 
being harmful to the public interest [or State property] 
or of impeding the assessment or collection of public 
revenues: 
 
Provided further that The Appellate Tribunal may, if it 
thinks fit, accept an application from any party to an 
appeal in which the Appellate Tribunal has rendered 
its decision, for a clarification of any of the issues 
raised by the Appellate Tribunal in its decision: 
 
Provided also that such application shall specify the 
precise issue in respect of which a clarification is 
sought and give reasons as to why a clarification is 
necessary: 
 

W.P. No. 26907 of 2024. 
6
(14) The Appellate Tribunal shall only accept such 
application if it is satisfied that a material issue 
discussed in its decision requires further clarification 
or elaboration. The party likely to be adversely 
affected by such clarification shall also be given a 
notice by the Appellate Tribunal: 
 
Provided that no application under this subsection 
shall be accepted by the Appellate Tribunal later than 
thirty days of its decision. 
 
(15) The Appellate Tribunal shall perform its functions 
under this Act in accordance with such procedures as 
may be prescribed. 
 
(16) A determination of the Commission shall be given 
full force and effect during the pendency of any appeal 
of such determination. 
 
(17) A person duly authorized by any interested party 
is entitled to appear, plead and act on behalf of such 
party before the Appellate Tribunal.”  
 
6. 
Above quoted Section stipulates the jurisdiction 
of the Appellate Tribunal which mandates to exercise 
Appellate jurisdiction under the Act and hear appeals of 
the interested parties against any of the initial or definite 
findings/outcomes initiated/undertaken or concluded 
under the scheme of the Act. Under subsection (1), an 
interested party may prefer appeal against the initiation 
of an investigation or a preliminary determination on 
the grounds of non-fulfillment of requirements provided 
in Sections 23 and 37 of the Act while subsection (ii) of 
Section 70 provides that any interested party may prefer 
an appeal to the Appellate Tribunal against an 
affirmative or negative final determination made under 
Section 39 by the Commission. Subsection (iii) on the 
other hand, postulates the right of appeal to the Tribunal 
against final determination pursuant to a review and 
subsection (iv) recognize the right of appeal against 
Commission's order for termination of investigation 
under Section 41 of the Act while subsection (v) 
provides the right of appeal against a determination of 
the Commission under Section 52 of the Act.  

W.P. No. 26907 of 2024. 
7
7. 
     Section 70 of the Act is an exhaustive 
provision, which does not only provide the substantive 
right of appeal and time limitation for preferring and 
decision of the same but it also lays down the 
procedural requirements for carrying out the whole 
appellate procedure. It stipulates a comprehensive 
scheme of exercising Appellate Jurisdiction by the 
Appellate Tribunal constituted under Section 64 of the 
Act against appeal preferred by an interested party 
either against initiation of investigation, preliminary 
determination or final determination and also provides 
limitation to as well as it also provides the procedure for 
hearing 
the 
same 
including 
chalking 
out 
the 
requirements for a decision of the Tribunal. Moreover, 
subsection (13) lays down the substantive right of 
appeal against the decision of the Appellate Tribunal to 
the High Court. This whole scheme of remedial 
procedure is clearly suggestive of the fact that a 
Determination even though a Final Determination under 
Section 39 is not absolute and is open for scrutiny 
before the Appellate Tribunal if any interested party, 
dissatisfied with the same, prefers an appeal before it. It 
is further evident that the decision of the Appellate 
Tribunal pronounced under subsection (9) of Section 70 
is further open to judicial examination by the High 
Court under subsection (13) if an interested party still 
feels dissatisfied prefers so. These two-fold remedies 
are itself provided by the Act to an interested party 
whose rights have been determined and adjudged by the 
Commission and the Appellate Tribunal contrary to his 
interests and contradictory to the law in his 
understanding. The right of appeal is always provided 
by the law to ensure safe administration of justice and to 
enable an independent higher forum to dissect the 

W.P. No. 26907 of 2024. 
8
decisions of the lower forum on the scale of true spirit 
and interpretation of law involved in the matter and to 
ascertain that no miscarriage of justice was caused by 
the lower forum. The purpose of providing an Appellate 
authority is always to further the cause of justice and to 
rule out the probability of wrong decision rendered by 
the first judicial forum or the First Appellate Authority 
either due to mistake of fact or wrong application of law. 
Whenever an appeal is preferred by a discontented party 
before the Appellate Forum/Appellate Tribunal in a 
case, the said Appellate body is competent to set aside, 
affirm or modify the decision under appeal and if right 
of further appeal is available to a party against such 
decision, the second Appellate body, in this case the 
High Court, can similarly affirm, vary or alter the 
decision of the lower Appellate forum/the Appellate 
Tribunal. For reference reliance is placed on the case 
titled 
Shaheen 
Merchant 
Versus 
Federation 
of 
Pakistan/National Tarif Commission and others (2021 PTD 
2126). 
8. 
     The accumulative effect of this discussion is 
that when the statute has provided specific remedies 
of appeal to the Petitioner against Final Determination, 
and when right of another appeal is still available after 
the decision of the Appellate Tribunal, then in such a 
situation, the petitioners have no authority to invoke 
the extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court.  
9. 
      Now this comprehensive remedial algorithm 
of right of appeal against action and determination of 
the Commission under the Act which affects the rights 
and interests of any of the parties relating to the subject-
matter leaves no doubt that the law does not only 
recognize the rights of interested parties but also 
provides a specially constituted Tribunal to exercise 

W.P. No. 26907 of 2024. 
9
appellate jurisdiction under the Act and to give its 
reasoned decisions in accordance with subsection (10) 
of Section 70. 
10. 
        Indubitably, when an efficacious, alternate 
and time bound definite remedy is available before a 
Tribunal specially constituted under the law then resort 
to extra-ordinary Constitutional jurisdiction before this 
Court does not find favor under the law since the 
absence of these conditions are sine qua non for 
exercising Writ jurisdiction. The Honorable Supreme 
Court in “Rana Aftab Ahmad Khan v. Muhammad 
Ajmal” (PLD 2010 SC 1066) laid down the very 
principle while observing as follows:-  
"When the petitioner has no explanation to offer, 
as to why the "other remedy", which is a definite 
one in nature; is time bound and is, specifically 
designed and prescribed by the legislature 
keeping into consideration time constraints in the 
election process, but has not been availed for any 
good reason, by the petitioner. Whether still the 
High Court should have imperatively interfered in 
the matter and the refusal thereof, should be 
construed as an erroneous or patently illegal 
order 
or 
an 
order 
suffering 
from 
any 
jurisdictional defect calling for the intervention by 
this Court in its instant jurisdiction? The answer 
is in negative".  
 
The Honorable Court further concluded:-  
 
"12. Resultantly, in the circumstances of the case, 
the High Court had rightly refused to interfere in 
its 
constitutional 
jurisdiction, 
when 
an 
appropriate, efficacious and adequate alternate 
remedy available to the petitioner has not been 
availed by him without any justification..."  
 
11. 
     This proposition was further discussed and 
elaborated by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
a recent judgment titled “MIAN AZAM WAHEED AND 
2 OTHERS V. THE COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS 
THROUGH 
ADDITIONAL 
COLLECTOR 
OF 

W.P. No. 26907 of 2024. 
10
CUSTOMS, KARACHI” (2023 PTD 1571) in the 
following manner: 
 
“The writ jurisdiction of the High Court cannot be 
exploited as the sole solution or remedy for ventilating all 
miseries, distresses and plights regardless of having 
equally efficacious, alternate and adequate remedy 
provided under the law which cannot be bypassed to 
attract the writ jurisdiction. The doctrine of exhaustion of 
remedies stops a litigant from pursuing a remedy in a new 
court or jurisdiction until the remedy already provided 
under the law is exhausted. The profound rationale 
accentuated in this doctrine is that the litigant should not 
be encouraged to circumvent or bypass the provisions 
assimilated in the relevant statute paving the way for 
availing remedies with precise procedure to challenge the 
impugned action, so as in this case, the Customs Act, 
which is in its own wisdom a complete set of law with 
regard to the genus of remedies, but the petitioners, rather 
than filing a Revision petition against the impugned 
Valuation Ruling under section 25-D of the Customs Act, 
directly approached the learned Islamabad High Court 
where the writ petitions were ultimately dismissed due to 
lack of jurisdiction and the net result emerging from the 
entire litigation is that the impugned valuation ruling is 
intact. The extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court 
under Article 199 of the Constitution cannot be reduced to 
an ordinary jurisdiction of the High Court. In the case of 
Dr. Sher Afgan Khan Niazi v. Ali S. Habib and others 
(2011 SCMR 1813), this Court held that the question of 
adequate or alternate remedy has been discussed time and 
again by this Court and it is well settled by now that the 
words "adequate remedy" connote an efficacious, 
convenient, beneficial, effective and speedy remedy. It 
was further held that the superior Courts should not 
involve themselves into investigations of disputed 
question of fact which necessitate taking of evidence. 
While referring to the various dictums laid down in the 
case of State Life Insurance Corporation of Pakistan v. 
Pakistan Tobacco Co. Ltd., (PLD 1983 SC 280), Gul 
Ahmed Textile Mills Ltd v. Collector of Customs 
(Appraisement, (1990 MLD 126), Pak. Metal Industries v. 
Assistant Collector (1990 CLC 1022), Allah Wasaya v. 
Tehsildar/AC 1st Grade, (1981 CLC 1202), Syed Riaz 
Hussain Zaidi v. Muhammad Iqbal, (PLD 1981 Lah. 215), 
Abdul Hafeez v. Chairman, Municipal Corporation (PLD 
1967 Lah. 1251), this Court also provided enlightened and 
levelheaded guiding principles to be considered by the 
High Courts to determine the adequacy of the alternate 
remedy in the following terms:- 
(i) 
If the relief available through the alternative 
remedy in its nature or extent is not what is necessary to 
give the requisite relief, the alternative remedy is not an 
"other adequate remedy" within the meaning of Article 
199. 
(ii) 
If the relief available through the alternative 
remedy, in its nature and extent, is what is necessary to 
give the requisite relief, the 'adequacy' of the alternative 

W.P. No. 26907 of 2024. 
11
remedy must further be judged, with reference to a 
comparison of the speed, expense or convenience of 
obtaining that relief through the alternative remedy, with 
the speed, expense or convenience of obtaining it under 
Article 199. But in making this comparison those factors 
must not be taken into account which would themselves 
alter if the remedy under Article 199 were used as a 
substitute for the other remedy. 
(iii) 
In practice the following steps may be taken:- 
(a) 
Formulate the grievance in the given case, as a 
generalized category; 
(b) 
Formulate the relief that is necessary to redress 
that category of grievance; 
(c) 
See if the law has prescribed any remedy that can 
redress that category of grievance in that way and to the 
required extent; 
(d) 
If such a remedy is prescribed the law 
contemplates that resort must be had to that remedy; 
(e) 
If it appears that the machinery established for 
the purposes of that remedy is not functioning properly, 
the correct step to take will be a step that is calculated to 
ensure, as far as lies in the power of the Court, that that 
machinery begins to function as it should. It would not be 
correct to take over the function of that machinery. If the 
function of another organ is taken over, that other organ 
will atrophy, and the organ that takes over, will break 
down under the strain; 
(f) 
If there is no other remedy that can redress that 
category of grievance in that way and to the required 
extent, or if there is such a remedy but conditions are 
attached to it which for a particular category of cases 
would neutralise or defeat it so as to deprive it of its 
substance, the Court should give the requisite relief under 
Article 199; 
(g) 
If there is such other remedy, but there is 
something so special in the circumstances of a given case 
that the other remedy which generally adequate, to the 
relief required for that category of grievance, is not 
adequate to the relief that is essential in the very special 
category to which that case belongs, the Court should 
give the required relief under Article 199. 
 
If the procedure for obtaining the relief by some 
other proceedings is too cumbersome or the relief cannot 
be obtained without delay and expense, or the delay 
would make the grant of the relief meaningless this court 
would not hesitate to issue a writ if the party applying for 
it is found entitled to it, simply because the party could 
have chosen another course to obtain the relief which is 
due." (Ibrahim T.M. Ltd. v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 
1989 Lah. 47, Allah Ditta v. Muhammad Saeed Vatoo 
PLD 1961 Lah. 479, Shamas Din and Bros. v. Income-tax 
and Sales Tax Officer PLD 1959 Lah. 955, Khaliq Najam 
Co. v. Sales-Tax Officer PLD 1959 Lahore 915).” 
 
12. 
        In view of the above, it can be easily 
gathered that the instant petition, in presence of an 
adequate alternate remedy of appeal, is not maintainable.

       As a corollary of above discussion, this 
petition is dismissed-in-limine.
