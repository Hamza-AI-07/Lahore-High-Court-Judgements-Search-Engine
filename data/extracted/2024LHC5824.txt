Anwaar Hussain, J. Petitioner No.1, namely, Mst. Zaib un 
Nisa (“the petitioner”) instituted a suit for recovery of her dower, 
dowry articles as also maintenance allowance of petitioner No.2 
(minor daughter), born from the wedlock of the petitioner with 
respondent No.2, namely, Shafqat Ali (“the respondent”). The suit 
was decreed, vide judgment and decree dated 17.12.2016. The 
petitioner was held entitled to recover dower to the tune of 07-Tola 
gold ornaments or Rs.100,000/-, as alternate value. Both sides 
preferred separate appeals, which were dismissed, vide judgment and 
decree dated 28.03.2017, on the ground that since the maintenance has 
been fixed @ Rs.5000/-, for the minor, and alternate value of dower 
has been fixed as Rs.100,000/-, therefore, the appeals were not 
maintainable. No further proceedings took place. Thereafter, the 
execution proceedings were initiated.  
2. 
The bone of contention is the dower in the shape of 07-Tola 
gold ornaments or its alternate value thereof. During the execution 
proceedings, the petitioner filed an application with the averments that 
either 07-Tola gold ornaments is to be recovered from the respondent 
or the present market value should be paid, which application was 
accepted by the Executing Court, vide order dated 10.07.2018, where-

against the respondent filed a revision petition, which was converted 
into an appeal and the order dated 10.07.2018 was set aside vide 
impugned judgment dated 05.11.2018 and it was held that the 
petitioner is only entitled to recover Rs.100,000/- as her dower.    
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the impugned 
judgment dated 05.11.2018 passed in the execution proceedings, has 
travelled beyond the actual judgment and decree dated 17.12.2016, 
which clearly depicts that the petitioner is entitled to 07-Tola gold 
ornaments or its alternate value i.e., Rs.100,000/-. 
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent submits that the 
prayer of the petitioner was to the extent of recovery of her dower, 
which in the first place was clearly settled as Rs.100,000/-, in terms of 
entry recorded in Column No.13 of the Nikahnama, and the petitioner 
cannot deviate from the same. Adds that once the Trial Court rendered 
the judgment and both sides preferred appeals, the appeals were 
dismissed on the ground that same is not maintainable as the quantum 
of dower is Rs.100,000/-, from which it can be easily inferred that the 
dower was not 07-Tola gold ornaments but only Rs.100,000/-. 
Therefore, the impugned finding of the Appellate Court below has 
been justly passed. Further contends that during the execution 
proceedings, plea of the petitioner that she is entitled to 07-Tola gold 
ornaments or its current market value is beyond the decree, dated 
17.12.2016, holding the field, therefore, the Appellate Court below 
has justly upended the finding of the Executing Court dated 
10.07.2018, whereby the petitioner was held entitled to recover 07-
Tola gold ornaments or its alternate value at the present market value. 
Further adds that initially the petitioner only claimed 07-Tola gold 
ornaments in the execution petition filed by the petitioner, to which 
the respondent objected and an order was passed that the execution 
petition be amended in accordance with the judgment and decree 
dated 17.12.2016. Consequently, the figure Rs.100,000/- was added in 

 
 
W.P. No.3346/2018 
3 
 
 
 
the execution petition, which order was not assailed and the same 
amounts to an admission on part of the petitioner that alternate value 
of her dower is Rs.100,000/-.     
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
6. 
The nub of the matter is to examine the following points: 
 
i. 
What was the dower of the petitioner settled by the 
parties through Nikahnama dated 19.03.2007? 
 
ii. 
Whether through the impugned judgment dated 
05.11.2018, the Appellate Court below, during the 
course of execution proceedings, was justified in 
holding that only Rs.100,000/- was the dower 
fixed by the parties when the Trial Court vide 
judgment and decree dated 17.12.2016 has clearly 
held that it was 07-Tola gold ornaments or its 
alternate value (Rs.100,000/-), which is to be paid 
by the judgment debtor? 
  
7. 
Before rendering the opinion on the above articulated points of 
determination, it will be appropriate to reproduce the relevant 
Columns of the Nikahnama of the parties, which read as under:

The judgment and decree dated 17.12.2016 was rendered after a full-
fledged trial. The appraisal of evidence led the Trial Court to conclude 
that the dower amount was settled as Rs.100,000/- in the year 2007 

 
 
W.P. No.3346/2018 
4 
 
 
 
i.e., on 19.03.2007 and in lieu thereof gold ornaments weighing 07-
Tola, consisting of necklace and bangles were given to the petitioner 
and few days prior to the marriage of sister of the respondent, the 
same were taken back and were used to meet marriage expenses of the 
said sister of the respondent. Once it was admitted that in lieu of 
Rs.100,000/- recorded in Column No.13 of the Nikahnama, 07-Tola 
gold ornaments were given and it was proved upon the statement of 
the PWs in general and PW-2, namely, Muhammad Imtiaz, who is 
close relative of the respondent that gold ornaments were repossessed 
by the respondent side, there was no reason for the Appellate Court 
below, while examining the matter during the course of execution 
proceedings, to hold that the dower was settled as Rs.100,000/- and 
the petitioner was not entitled to recover 07-Tola gold ornaments. 
Suffice to mention that once the gold ornaments were given as dower, 
in lieu of Rs.100,000/- the same became the property of the 
bride/petitioner, which she is entitled to recover as taking back of the 
ornaments was proved during the trial, hence, entry of Rs.100,000/- 
recorded in Column No.13 as dower becomes irrelevant. In this 
manner, the Appellate Court below, through impugned judgment has 
travelled beyond the judgment and decree dated 17.12.2016, which 
had attained finality.  
8. 
Similarly, argument of learned counsel for the respondent that 
the petitioner is estopped from claiming gold ornaments as she filed 
the execution petition and claimed 07-Tola gold ornaments, to which 
the respondent objected and an order was passed that the execution 
petition be amended in accordance with the judgment and decree 
dated 17.12.2016, which requires satisfaction and accordingly the 
figure Rs.100,000/- was added is also misconceived inasmuch as the 
addition of Rs. 100,000/- in the execution petition, without deletion of 
07 Tola gold ornaments, does not mean that the petitioner has waived 

 
 
W.P. No.3346/2018 
5 
 
 
 
her claim to the gold ornaments or exercised her choice to relinquish 
her dower already received by her and subsequently repossessed.  
9. 
Adverting to the second question as to whether the Executing 
Court was justified in accepting the application of the petitioner for 
payment of alternate price at the prevailing market rate regarding gold 
ornaments decreed in favour of the petitioner, suffice to observe that 
the purpose of determining alternate value is to enable the decree 
holder to obtain adequate compensation when the principal item (in 
family matters, dowry articles or the dower property) is not traceable 
or is in a condition/position that the same cannot be returned or 
recovered, for example a dowry article has been lost or damaged. 
Moreover, the word “alternate” has special significance. It can be used 
both as noun or an adjective. In the legal context, when used as an 
adjective, it describes something that offers or expresses a choice. 
When used as noun, it describes something that substitutes another. In 
the context of a decree passed in a case, this choice is vested with the 
decree holder-the petitioner in present case. In the instant case, dower 
is very much clear in terms of its weight i.e., 07-Tola gold and is 
easily available in the market. The petitioner cannot be compelled to 
accept its alternate value that was settled at the time of Nikah and/or 
the decree. The Executing Court is ensuring implementation of the 
decree dated 17.12.2016, the satisfaction whereof is being delayed by 
the respondent, on one pretext or the other. Such practice on part of 
the respondent is deprecated in terms of dicta laid down by Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in case of “Haseen Ullah v Mst. Naheed Begum and 
others” (PLD 2022 Supreme Court 686). The Supreme Court held 
that the entries recorded in Columns No.13 and 16 of the Nikahnama 
are obligations of husband and any act whereby the said obligations 
are not discharged in timely manner is highly deplorable. Therefore, 
by no stretch of imagination, alternate value of Rs.100,000/- can be 
treated as adequate substitute of the actual dower i.e., 07-Tola gold 

 
 
W.P. No.3346/2018

ornaments. Hence, the Executing Court correctly allowed the 
application of the petitioner as it is for the petitioner to opt as to 
whether to go for the actual dower i.e., 07-Tola gold ornaments, 
which became her property after the same was settled and delivered to 
her or accept its alternate value.  
10. 
The matter can be examined form another angle. The family 
law and the provisions of the enactments such as the West Pakistan 
Family Courts Act, 1964 and the Muslim Family Law Ordinance, 
1961 have to be considered and interpreted favourably towards the 
females being the beneficial legislation. The same principle is to be 
followed in construing and interpreting a decree passed in a family 
suit, if any ambiguity is found or dispute arises therein between the 
parties regarding scope of the decree. The duty of the Executing Court 
is to carry out the decree and not to add to it or hang it any way. In the 
instant case, it would be unjust to interpret the decree dated 
17.12.2016 in such a manner as put forth by the respondent and 
justified by the Appellate Court below, during execution, as this 
would amount to vesting a choice in the judgment debtor (the 
respondent in present case) to satisfy a decree, which favours him by 
adopting such means of satisfaction of such decree that are 
detrimental to the interest of the female – the petitioner/decree holder. 
In the instant case, the gold ornaments were handed over to the 
petitioner as dower, which were subsequently taken back and so 
proved during the trial, which resulted in the passing of the decree 
dated 17.12.2016. Thus, the ownership of the gold ornaments became 
vested in the petitioner and any accretion and appreciation of the 
value of gold ornaments are also to be cherished and enjoyed by the 
petitioner and she cannot be deprived of such accretion by offering 
alternate value fixed at the time of her Nikah. 
11. 
In view of the above discussion, the impugned judgment passed 
by the Appellate Court below is not sustainable. The present petition 

 
 
W.P. No.3346/2018

is allowed. As a corollary, the impugned judgment dated 05.11.2018 
is set aside, and the order of the Executing Court dated 10.07.2018 is 
upheld. No order as to costs.
