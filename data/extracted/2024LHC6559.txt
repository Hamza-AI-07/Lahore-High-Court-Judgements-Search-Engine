Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – This appeal is directed against the 
judgment dated 6.10.2023 delivered by the Additional Sessions Judge, 
Jatoi, in case FIR No. 497/2021 dated 26.8.2021 registered under sections 
292-C and 376(iii) of the Pakistan Penal Code 1860 (PPC) at Police Station 
Shaher Sultan, District Muzaffargarh. 
2. 
 
On 26.8.2021, PW-3 Abid Hussain (the “Complainant”) 
submitted a written application (Exh. PB) to Nusrat Parveen/SI (PW-11) at 
Police Station Shaher Sultan, District Muzaffargarh, stating that he lived in 
Basti Mochi, Mauza Bullu Sandeela, Jatoi. On 22.8.2021 at about 8:00 
a.m., his daughter “S” (name withheld to preserve privacy), aged about 7 or 
8 years, was on her way to school when Nazar Hussain, a grocer, 
deceitfully lured her into the washroom behind his store and raped her. S’s 
cries attracted Muhammad Niaz and Abdul Hameed to the scene. The 
accused fled from the spot on seeing them. The witnesses informed the 
Complainant about the occurrence through a phone call. The Complainant 
further stated that he possessed a video of the incident made by Atta Ullah, 
which he would produce to substantiate the allegation. 
3. 
 
Nusrat Parveen/SI instructed the Complainant to bring the S’s 
clothing that she had been wearing at the time of the incident, issued a 

Crl. Appeal No.964/J/2023

docket for her medical examination, and deputed Faria Khadim 783/LC 
(PW-6) to take her to the hospital. Simultaneously, she handed over the 
application Exh. PB to Mehboob Ullah/ASI (PW-10), who registered FIR 
No.497/2021 Exh. PH. 
4. 
 
On the same day, i.e., 26.8.2021, Nusrat Parveen/SI went to 
the crime scene, prepared the rough site plan (Exh. PJ), and recorded the 
statements of the PWs, including the Complainant. She also received a 
USB (P-6) from the Complainant through Recovery Memo Exh. PC, and 
made it over to Abdul Shakoor 527/C (PW-7) for getting print-outs. After 
sometime PW Abdul Shakoor brought five photographs (P-1 to P-5) which 
Nusrat Parveen/SI secured through Recovery Memo Exh. PE, and then 
handed the USB to the Moharrar for safekeeping. 
5. 
 
On 27.8.2021, Faria Khadim 783/LC delivered S’s MLC and 
two envelopes, one sealed and another unsealed, to Nusrat Parveen/SI, 
which the Medical Officer, Dr. Noor-ul-Falah (PW-9), had handed over to 
her. Nusrat Parveen/SI took the same into her possession through Recovery 
Memo Exh. PD and later gave them to the Moharrar for safekeeping. The 
same day, she arrested Nazar Hussain and, on 28.8.2021, obtained his 
physical remand. On 30.8.2021, she delivered the parcels and produced 
both the victim and Nazar Hussain at the office of the Punjab Forensic 
Science Agency (PFSA) for DNA profiling. On 31.8.2021, Nusrat 
Parveen/SI produced S before the Area Magistrate for recording her 
statement under section 164 Cr.P.C. Then, she arranged for Nazar Hussain 
to undergo a potency test, which Dr. Mehboob Ahmad (PW-1) conducted. 
On 2.9.2021, Nusrat Parveen/SI recorded the Complainant’s supplementary 
statement by which he implicated Atta Ullah and Muhammad Jalal as 
accused in the case. The same day, she arrested them and, on 3.9.2021, 
obtained their physical remand. On 4.9.2021, Nazar Hussain was sent to 
judicial remand. On 9.9.2021, Jalal’s father submitted an Infinix cellphone 
X680B (P-6) to Nusrat Parveen/SI, which she secured through Recovery 
Memo Exh. PF and later handed it over to the Moharrar for safekeeping. 
On 10.9.2021, Atta Ullah and Jalal were sent to judicial custody. On 
13.9.2021, Nusrat Parveen/SI delivered the cellphone P-6 to the Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency (PFSA). The report under section 173 Cr.P.C. 
was submitted to the court upon completion of the investigation.

6. 
 
On 11.1.2022, the Additional Sessions Judge indicted Nazar 
Hussain, Atta Ullah, and Jalal. They denied the charge and claimed trial. 
The prosecution examined twelve witnesses to prove its case. Abid Hussain 
(PW-3) was S’s father who lodged FIR No.497/2021. Muhammad Niaz 
(PW-4) furnished the ocular account while S, the victim, testified as PW-5. 
Dr. Noor-ul-Falah (PW-9) medically examined S. Dr. Mehboob Ahmad 
(PW-1) provided evidence regarding Nazar Hussain’s fitness to have 
intercourse. Mehboob Ullah/ASI (PW-10) registered FIR No. 497/2021 
Exh. PH. Ghulam Qasim 1047/HC (PW-2) was the Moharrar of the police 
station and deposed about the receipt of two envelopes and a USB (P-6) 
from the Investigating Officer and subsequently handing them over to her 
for their delivery at the PFSA. Faria Khadim 783/LC (PW-6) escorted  
S for her medical examination and subsequently handed over her MLC to 
the Investigating Officer. She was a marginal witness of Recovery Memos 
Exh. PD and Exh. PE. Abdul Shakoor 527/C (PW-7) testified about 
receiving the USB P-6 from the Investigating Officer, obtaining its print-
out from the market (P-1 to P-5), and delivering them to her. He was a 
marginal witness of Recovery Memo Exh. PE. Anjum Shahzad 2101/HC 
(PW-8) testified about the production of a cellphone P-6 by Jalal’s father. 
He was a marginal witness of Recovery Memo Exh. PF. Nusrat Parveen/SI 
(PW-11) gave the details of her investigation. Ms. Sajida Mehboob Alam 
Khan, Area Magistrate (PW-12), testified about recording the victim’s 
statement under section 164 Cr.P.C. (Exh. PJ). The public prosecutor gave 
up PW Irshad Hussain/Constable being unnecessary and closed the 
prosecution evidence after tendering the reports of PFSA Exh. PK, Exh. PL 
and Exh. PM. 
7. 
 
After the prosecution was through with its evidence, the 
Additional Sessions Judge recorded the statements of Nazar Hussain, Atta 
Ullah, and Jalal under section 342 Cr.P.C. and confronted them with the 
incriminating material brought against them during the trial. They refuted 
the allegations and professed their innocence. When questioned about the 
reason for their implication in the case, Nazar Hussain stated that he had 
been a witness in an FIR case lodged by Muhammad Bakhsh, the father of 
the brother-in-law (Behnoi) of Abid Hussain (the present Complainant). He 
claimed that he did not give evidence in that case, and due to this grudge, 

Crl. Appeal No.964/J/2023 
 
 
 
- 4 -
Abid Hussain registered a false case against him. On the other hand, Atta 
Ullah and Jalal stated that the Complainant falsely implicated them because 
they refused to become witnesses in the present case against Nazar 
Hussain. None of the accused had their statements recorded on oath under 
section 340(2) Cr.P.C., nor did they examine any witnesses in their 
defence. 
8. 
 
On the conclusion of the trial, vide judgment dated 6.10.2023, 
the Additional Sessions Judge acquitted Muhammad Jalal and convicted 
Nazar Hussain and Atta Ullah as follows: 
Nazar Hussain 
Convicted under section 376(iii) PPC and sentenced to life imprisonment 
with a fine of Rs.200,000/- and, in default thereof, to suffer rigorous 
imprisonment for further six months. 
Atta Ullah 
Convicted under section 292-C PPC and sentenced to rigorous 
imprisonment for fourteen years with a fine of Rs.200,000/- and, in 
default thereof, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for further one month. 
 
 
However, the Additional Sessions Judge extended the benefit 
of section 382-B Cr.P.C. to the convicts. Hence, this appeal. 
9. 
 
The Appellants, Nazar Hussain and Atta Ullah, have filed Crl. 
Misc. No.230/2024, an application under section 345 Cr.P.C. seeking 
permission to compound the offence and for their acquittal of the charge. 
They have appended affidavits of Complainant Abid Hussain and S with 
their application and submit that a Panchayat had brokered a compromise 
between the parties. Hence, they do not want to pursue the case anymore.  
10. 
 
In support of Crl. Misc. No.230/2024, the Appellant’s counsel, 
Advocate Malik Muhammad Usman Bhatti, relied upon Zulfiqaruddin v. 
State etc. [PLJ 2022 SC (Cr.C.) 40]. 
11. 
 
The District Public Prosecutor contended that the offences 
under sections 292-C and 376(iii) PPC are not compoundable. He argued 
that Mr. Bhatti’s reliance on Zulfiqaruddin’s case was misplaced, as it was 
decided on its peculiar facts. Consequently, he submitted that the 
aforementioned application was misconceived and should be dismissed. 
12. 
 
Section 345 Cr.P.C. governs the compounding of offences. 
The offences listed in the Table under sub-section (1) of this section, which 

Crl. Appeal No.964/J/2023 
 
 
 
- 5 -
are punishable under the Pakistan Penal Code, are compoundable by the 
persons mentioned in its third column without requiring the court’s 
permission. In contrast, the offences listed in the Table under sub-section 
(2) are compoundable only if the court permits. As a result, the offences 
not enumerated in either Table cannot be compounded. 
13. 
 
Offences created under special laws are governed by the 
provisions of those laws and may only be compounded if explicitly 
permitted by the law creating the offence. Section 345(5A) Cr.P.C. 
provides that a High Court, exercising its revisional powers under section 
439 Cr.P.C., or a Court of Session under section 439-A Cr.P.C., may 
permit the compounding of any offence that is compoundable under section 
345 Cr.P.C. Importantly, section 345(7) Cr.P.C. expressly states that no 
offence shall be waived or compounded except as provided under section 
345 Cr.P.C. and section 311 PPC.1  
14. 
 
In Muhammad Rawab v. The State (2004 SCMR 1170), the 
convict sought the court’s permission to compound the offence, asserting 
that the complainant had pardoned him in the name of Almighty Allah. 
Upon examining the compromise, it was observed that the offences under 
section 365-A PPC and section 7(e) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, were 
not compoundable. The Supreme Court deliberated on whether it could 
allow the compounding of offences not listed in section 345 Cr.P.C., 
particularly in light of the express prohibition under section 345(7) Cr.P.C. 
against entertaining a compromise for offences not specified therein. It 
ruled: 
“The provisions as contained in section 345(7) Cr.P.C. have been 
couched in such a plain and simple language that there is hardly any 
scope for any interpretation except that a non-compoundable offence 
cannot be made compoundable by this Court for the simple reason that 
no amendment, deletion, insertion or addition could be made by this 
Court and it could only be done by the Legislature as this aspect of the 
matter falls in its exclusive domain of jurisdiction. The provisions as 
contained in section 345 Cr.P.C. cannot be stretched too far by including 
                                         
1 Section 311 PPC provides: 
311. Ta’zir after waiver or compounding of right of qisas in qatl-i-amd.– Where all the wali 
do not waive or compound the right of qisas, or if the principle of fasad-fil-arz is attracted, the 
court may, in its discretion having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, punish an 
offender against whom the right of qisas has been waived or compounded with death or 
imprisonment of life or imprisonment of either description for a term of which may extend to 
fourteen years as ta’zir. 
Provided that if the offence is committed in the name or on the pretext of honour, the 
punishment shall be imprisonment for life. 

Crl. Appeal No.964/J/2023

the non-compoundable offence therein under the garb of humanitarian 
grounds or any other extraneous consideration. The offences committed 
by the appellant are not of grave and alarming nature but the same are 
against the society as a whole and cannot be permitted to compound by 
any individual on any score whatsoever. It may be noted that tabulation 
of the offences as made under section 345 Cr.P.C. being unambiguous 
remove all doubts, uncertainty and must be taken as complete and 
comprehensive guide for compounding the offences. The judicial 
consensus seems to be that ‘the Legislature has laid down in this section 
the test for determining the classes of offences which concern individuals 
only as distinguished from those which have reference to the interests of 
the State and Courts of law cannot go beyond that test and substitute for 
it one of their own. It is against public policy to compound a non-
compoundable offence, keeping in view the state of facts existing on the 
date of application to compound. No offence shall be compounded 
except where the provisions of section 345 Cr.P.C. are satisfied as to all 
‘matters mentioned in the section’.”2 
15. 
 
In Meenakshi Sundarammal and another v. K. Subramania 
Ayyar and others (AIR 1955 Madras 369), while considering section 320 
of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, which parallels section 
345 Cr.P.C. in Pakistan, the Madras High Court held that an agreement 
intended to terminate criminal proceedings in a manner not in accordance 
with section 320 would fall within the mischief of section 23 of the 
Contract Act, 1872. 
16. 
 
In 
Shimbhu 
and 
another 
v. 
State 
of 
Haryana  
(AIR 2014 SC 739), the Supreme Court of India (SCI) emphasized that 
compromises in rape cases cannot justify even a reduction in punishment. It 
ruled that rape, being a non-compoundable offence, is a crime against 
society and cannot be resolved through private agreements between the 
parties. The Supreme Court highlighted that the victim’s consent to such a 
compromise might not be genuine, as it could be influenced by coercion 
from the accused or the psychological trauma endured over time. 
Accepting such compromises would unfairly burden the victim and allow 
the accused to exploit their influence. Therefore, in the interest of justice 
and to protect the victim from undue pressure or harassment, it would not 
                                         
2 The Supreme Court relied upon the following authorities for its holding: 
Dalsukhram Hargovandas v. Charles DeBretton (28 Bombay 326); Meenakshi Sundarammal v. 
Subramania Ayyar (AIR 1955 Madaras 369); Akshoy Singh v. Rameshawar Bagdi  
(AIR 1917 Calcutta 705); Mt. Rani v. Mt. Jaiwanti (AIR 1925 Nag. 395); Crown v. Muhammad 
Hussain (PLD 1950 Lahore 86); Gurunarayan Das and others v. Emperor (AIR 1948 Pat. 58); 
Agha Nazarali Sultan Muhammad v. Emperor (AIR 1941 Sind 186); Emperor v. Jarnally and 
others (AIR 1925 Lahore 464); Ghulam Rasool v. State (1999 MLD 3085); Muhammad Asif v. 
State (1991 MLD 1026); Noor Muhammad alias Noora v. State (1992 SCMR 2079); 
Muhammad Nazir alias Jeera v. State (PLD 2001 Lahore 212); Muhammad Anwar v. State  
(1986 MLD 1111); Nawab-ul-Hassan v. State (2003 SCMR 658) and Yousaf Ali v. State  
(2002 SCMR 1885).

be appropriate to consider a compromise between the parties as a basis for 
the court to exercise discretionary power under the proviso to section 
376(2) of the Indian Penal Code to reduce the sentence. 
17. 
 
In State of M.P. v. Madanlal (AIR 2015 SC 3003), the SCI 
categorically rejected the notion of compromise in cases involving rape or 
attempted rape, deeming it completely unacceptable. The Court 
underscored that such offences defile the sanctity of a woman’s body, 
which is her sacred temple, and inflict irreparable harm on her dignity and 
reputation. The Court further observed that suggestions of compromise, 
often cloaked in the guise of the perpetrator agreeing to marry the victim, 
are nothing more than veiled attempts to exert pressure. It stated that such 
deceptive practices must be firmly opposed, as adopting a lenient stance 
would constitute a grave miscarriage of justice. The Court emphasized that 
mediation or any similar resolution mechanism in rape cases is strictly 
prohibited and legally impermissible. 
18. 
 
Recently, in Muhammad Imran v. The State and another 
(Criminal Petition No. 725/2023), decided on 26.06.2024, the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan, while delivering a majority decision of 2:1 on the merits 
of the case, unanimously declined to accept the compromise regarding the 
offences under sections 376 and 449 PPC, reaffirming the non-
compoundable nature of such grave offences. 
19. 
 
It is necessary to examine Zulfiqaruddin’s case, which was 
relied upon by Mr. Bhatti. In this case, Zulfiqaruddin faced charges of 
house trespass, abduction of Mst. A.B., a murderous assault on Mst. 
Haleema Bibi, and the rape of Mst. A.B. He was prosecuted under sections 
452, 324, 337-A(i), 365-B, 376, and 34 PPC. After a full-fledged trial, the 
Additional Sessions Judge convicted him. During the appeal hearing, the 
parties entered into a compromise. The High Court set aside all convictions 
and sentences for compoundable offences, and reduced the sentences for 
non-compoundable offences. The Supreme Court noted that the affidavits 
from the complainant and victims stated that Zulfiqaruddin had been 
implicated due to a misunderstanding, denying the allegations of abduction 
and rape, and the High Court accepted these affidavits, acquitting 
Zulfiqaruddin of compoundable offences and reduced his sentences for 

Crl. Appeal No.964/J/2023 
 
 
 
- 8 -
non-compoundable offences. The Supreme Court held that if the High 
Court accepted the affidavits declaring the allegations factually incorrect, it 
should have dismissed the entire prosecution case rather than merely 
reducing the sentences for non-compoundable offences. Accordingly, the 
Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the outstanding convictions 
and sentences, and acquitted Zulfiqaruddin, granting him the benefit of 
doubt. 
20. 
 
It would be seen that in Zulfiqaruddin’s case, there was no 
compromise as such. Instead, the complainant and the victims swore 
affidavits completely exonerating the accused. They stated that they had 
implicated Zulfiqaruddin due to some “misunderstandings” and that he had 
neither abducted anyone nor committed the alleged offences. The High 
Court could have rejected the affidavits entirely, but it accepted them 
partially – to the extent of the compoundable offences – which was 
unjustified. Thus, Zulfiqaruddin’s case proceeded on its own unique facts. 
It does not overrule or deviate from the settled law that non-compoundable 
offences cannot be compounded, the principle reaffirmed in Muhammad 
Rawab and Muhammad Imran.  
21. 
 
In the present case, Complainant Abid Hussain’s has stated in 
his affidavit that the respectables of the locality, and the Punchayat have 
assured him of the Appellants’ innocence, that he does not want to pursue 
the case further and that he had got the case registered because of 
misunderstanding. On the other hand, S’s affidavit categorically states that 
the Punchayat has effected a compromise between the parties. The relevant 
excerpt is reproduced below:

22. 
 
Given the above, we are of the considered opinion that the 
Appellants seek acquittal on the basis of a compromise. In fact, this is also 
what they have prayed for in Crl. Misc. No.230/2024. We hold that this 

Crl. Appeal No.964/J/2023 
 
 
 
- 9 -
application is not maintainable and accordingly dismiss it. We would 
decide the case on merits. 
The main case 
23. 
 
In support of this appeal, Mr. Bhatti argued that the FIR was 
lodged with an unexplained delay of four days, which impinged upon its 
credibility. He maintained that the Appellants were innocent and the 
Complainant had falsely implicated them in this case. He contended that 
Abid Hussain (PW-3) and Muhammad Niaz (PW-4) were not eyewitnesses 
to any wrongdoing by the Appellants. As regards S, he submitted that being 
a minor of tender age, she could not be relied upon without corroboration, 
which was absent. Mr. Bhatti further contended that the DNA report  
(Exh. PK) completely discredited the prosecution’s case, as no seminal 
material of Nazar Hussain was found on the victim’s body or clothes. He 
argued that the prosecution’s evidence was riddled with material 
contradictions, but the Additional Sessions Judge failed to properly 
evaluate these discrepancies, which had caused a grave miscarriage of 
justice. He prayed for the acceptance of Criminal Appeal No. 964/J/2023 
and the acquittal of the Appellants. 
24. 
 
The District Public Prosecutor controverted the above 
contentions. He argued that the prosecution proved its case to the hilt. The 
victim, S, fully supported the prosecution case and withstood cross-
examination with intelligence. Complainant Abid Hussain (PW-3) and 
Muhammad Niaz (PW-4) corroborated S on all crucial points. He further 
contended that the Appellants’ allegation of false implication was baseless 
and lacked evidence. He prayed for the dismissal of the Appellants’ appeal. 
Opinion 
25. 
 
According to the prosecution, the occurrence took place on 
22.8.2021 at 8:00 a.m., and the FIR was registered on 26.8.2021 at 5:30 
p.m., i.e., after four days and 9½ hours. While the law generally 
emphasizes the prompt reporting of crimes, courts acknowledge that sexual 
abuse cases require a more nuanced approach due to their sensitive nature. 
Delays in reporting such offences cannot be equated with delays in other 
crimes. Several factors can contribute to delay in reporting child sexual

- 10 -
abuse, including trauma,3 fear,4 shame,5 dishonour due to invasive 
examination by a doctor,6 threat,7 or a lack of awareness.8 Consequently, 
courts in our country do not consider the delay in making a report to the 
police material unless the circumstances are such that they warrant an 
adverse view. This is especially true in cases involving child victims of 
sexual abuse.9 In the present case, Mr. Bhatti has not referred us to any 
circumstance which may require us to take an adverse view against the 
prosecution because of the delay. No evidence suggests that this delay was 
used to fabricate or embellish the allegations. 
26. 
 
The prosecution’s case is that on 22.8.2021 at 8:00 a.m. S was 
on her way to school when Appellant Nazar Hussain deceitfully took her to 
the washroom behind his grocery shop and ravished her, and on seeing the 
witnesses, fled from the spot. The prosecution produced Abid Hussain 
(PW-3), Muhammad Niaz (PW-4), and the minor victim (PW-5) to prove 
the charge against him. The Complainant, who is S’s father, is relevant 
only to the extent of lodging FIR No.497/2021 (Exh. PH). He categorically 
admitted that he had not witnessed the occurrence as he was at home at that 
time. During cross-examination, he deposed that his brother-in-law 
Muhammad Niaz (PW-4) informed him about it on his cellphone. 
27. 
 
Muhammad Niaz (PW-4) deposed in line with the application 
Exh. PB and FIR No. 497/2021 (Exh. PH). He gave details of the incident, 
adding that he and PW Abdul Majeed witnessed it. He also confirmed that 
he informed the Complainant about it. Mr. Bhatti’s primary objection to 
Niaz’s testimony was that he was a chance witness, so his account should 
be viewed with skepticism. 
28. 
 
A “chance witness” is a person whose presence at the scene of 
an incident at the critical moment is purely by coincidence. It is not a part 
of their usual activities or duties. The testimony of a chance witness is

considered suspect evidence. It is generally not accepted unless credible 
and justifiable reasons are provided to establish their presence at the crime 
scene at the relevant time.10 Under normal circumstances, the law presumes 
their absence from the location.11 Nevertheless, a chance witness is not 
necessarily a false witness.12 His evidence should be scrutinized carefully.13 
If a chance witness reasonably explains his presence at the spot and his 
narration of occurrence inspires confidence, his evidence can be considered 
along with other evidence.14 A passerby is not a chance witness when a 
crime is committed on a public thoroughfare,15 at a place frequented by the 
public,16 or when his house is situated in the close vicinity of the scene of 
the crime. The version of a chance witness can be accepted to be true if his 
presence at the place of the incident is not doubtful.17  
29. 
 
Muhammad Niaz (PW-4) was a labourer who lived 2-3 acres 
away from the place of occurrence. He testified that he was on his way to 
work at the time of the incident. He heard S’s cries as he passed by 
Appellant Nazar Hussain’s shop. Since it was morning, when labourers 
typically head to work, his presence at the scene appears natural. Niaz 
withstood cross-examination, answering all questions confidently and 
naturally. Furthermore, as we shall see, his testimony aligns with the 
victim’s account. It confirms his presence at the scene during the relevant 
time and his direct observation of the incident. 
30. 
 
The victim, S, a minor aged 9-10 years, appeared before the 
trial court as PW-5. To evaluate her competency as a witness, the court 
conducted a voir dire test by asking her various questions and recorded her 
testimony after finding her competent. S identified Appellant Nazar 
Hussain by name and narrated the incident in detail, consistent with the

account provided in the FIR. She categorically denied the defence’s 
suggestion that she had falsely involved him in this case at the behest of her 
parents. Importantly, S also recorded her statement under section 164 
Cr.P.C. (Exh. PJ) as required under section 14(1) of the Anti-Rape 
(Investigation and Trial) Act, 2021, wherein she unequivocally accused 
Nazar Hussain of violating her. S’s statement under section 164 Cr.P.C. 
was duly proved by Ms. Sajida Mehboob Alam Khan, Area Magistrate 
(PW-12). Despite being subjected to incisive cross-examination, the 
defence failed to discredit her testimony or extract anything favourable to 
their case. 
31. 
 
Mr. Bhatti highlighted some inconsistencies in the testimonies 
of the aforementioned witnesses. These were insignificant, except for one 
that necessitates our comment. The Complainant and S stated that on 
22.8.2021, S was on her way to school when the incident occurred.  
Mr. Bhatti argued that 22.8.2021 was a Sunday, so the question of S going 
to school does not arise. However, during his cross-examination, 
Muhammad Niaz (PW-4) clarified that S was actually going to her 
teacher’s house for private tuition on that date. In a village setting, “tuition 
classes” are often referred to as “school.” This clarification by Niaz is 
sufficient to address the objection. Even if it does not, this inconsistency 
does not affect the substance of the case. In Nazir Ahmed v. The State 
(2023 SCMR 1299), the Supreme Court of Pakistan stated: 
“It is a well-settled proposition of law that as long as the material aspects 
of the evidence have a ring of truth, courts should ignore minor 
discrepancies in the evidence. The test is whether the evidence of a 
witness inspires confidence. If an omission or discrepancy goes to the 
root of the matter, the defence can take advantage of the same. While 
appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach must be whether the 
evidence read as a whole appears to have a ring of truth. Minor 
discrepancies on trivial matters not affecting the material considerations 
of the prosecution case ought not to prompt the courts to reject evidence 
in its entirety. Such minor discrepancies which do not shake the salient 
features of the prosecution case should be ignored.”18

“A rapist not only violates the victim’s privacy and personal integrity but 
inevitably causes serious psychological as well as physical harm in the 
process. Rape is not merely a physical assault – it is often destructive of 
the whole personality of the victim. A murderer destroys the physical 
body of his victim, a rapist degrades the very soul of the helpless female. 
The courts, therefore, shoulder a great responsibility while trying an 
accused on charges of rape. They must deal with such cases with utmost 
sensitivity. The courts should examine the broader probabilities of a case 
and not get swayed by minor contradictions or insignificant 
discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix, which are not of a fatal 
nature, to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case.” 
33. 
 
Dr. Mehboob Ahmad (PW-1) testified that he examined 
Appellant Nazar Hussain and confirmed that he was potent and capable of 
engaging in sexual intercourse. Dr. Noor-ul-Falah (PW-9) deposed that 
during the medical examination, S provided a history of the incident, 
recounting that Nazar Hussain had threatened her, forcibly raped her, and 
bitten, slapped, and kissed her. The lady doctor stated that she observed 
three small abrasions on a 2 cm area on the dorsal aspect of S’s right hand, 
approximately 1 cm above the wrist joint near the base of the little finger. 
She further observed that S’s hymen was completely ruptured and appeared 
fresh, indicating recent sexual intercourse. Hence, the medical evidence 
corroborates the victim’s testimony and supports the allegations against 
Nazar Hussain. 
34. 
 
According to the PFSA report (Exh. PK), no seminal material 
from Appellant Nazar Hussain was detected on S’s vaginal swabs sent for 
forensic analysis. However, it notes that several factors could account for 
this result, including the possible use of a condom, non-ejaculation, 
significant delays in the medico-legal examination, improper preservation 
or packaging of the evidence, or self-cleaning and bathing by the victim. 
These findings underscore the complexities of DNA evidence and its 
interpretation in criminal cases. 
35. 
 
DNA reports in criminal cases can be categorized into three 
types: positive, negative, and inconclusive, each carrying distinct 
implications. A positive DNA report conclusively links the accused to the 
biological evidence found at the crime scene or on the victim, serving as 
strong corroborative evidence to establish the identity of the perpetrator. 
However, its evidentiary value depends on safeguards, such as the proper 
chain of custody, preservation of evidence, and adherence to scientific 
protocols. Without these safeguards, its reliability may be questioned. On 

Crl. Appeal No.964/J/2023

the other hand, a negative DNA report indicates no match between the 
accused’s DNA and the biological material analyzed. Nevertheless, such 
findings do not necessarily exonerate the accused, as factors like condom 
use, non-ejaculation, delays in examination, or contamination could explain 
the absence of DNA. Inconclusive DNA reports arise when forensic 
analysis fails to produce a definitive result due to issues like degraded 
samples, insufficient DNA material, or contamination. Such reports neither 
implicate nor exclude the accused, requiring courts to consider other 
available evidence to reach a fair conclusion. When the DNA report is 
negative or inconclusive, courts must consider other evidence, such as 
medical findings, eyewitness testimony, and circumstantial facts, to 
determine the accused’s culpability.  
36. 
 
In Ali Haider alias Papu v. Jameel Hussain and others  
(PLD 2021 SC 362), the Supreme Court of Pakistan emphasized that DNA 
testing provides courts with a high degree of confidence in identifying 
perpetrators, thereby aiding in convicting actual offenders and exonerating 
the wrongfully accused.19 Despite its strength, DNA evidence is considered 
corroborative rather than primary,20 meaning it strengthens and supports 
other evidence but is not by itself conclusive proof. 
37. 
 
Section 375 PPC explicitly defines rape as the penetration of 
the vagina, mouth, urethra, or anus with any body part or object, regardless 
of whether seminal discharge occurs. Therefore, even the slightest 
penetration constitutes rape.21 The presence of spermatozoa in the victim’s 
private part is not a prerequisite to establish penetration.22 The essence of 
the offence lies in the violation of bodily integrity and autonomy, not the 
physical outcomes of the act. The law prioritizes the protection of the 
victim’s dignity and bodily autonomy over the presence of biological 
evidence like spermatozoa. In a nub, the absence of seminal material is not 
fatal to the prosecution’s case.23  
                                         
19 In this regard, also see:  Salman Akram Raja and another v. Government of Punjab (2013 SCMR 203).

Appellant Nazar Hussain has not explained why the 
Complainant and prosecution witnesses would falsely accuse him. In his 
statement under section 342 Cr.P.C., he claimed that he was a witness in an 
FIR lodged by Muhammad Bukhsh, the father of the Complainant’s 
brother-in-law, and that his failure to testify in that case led to his false 
implication in the present matter. This defence lacks credibility, as it is 
implausible that anyone would jeopardize their honour and reputation over 
such a trivial issue. Given the fact that medical evidence confirms the 
commission of the offence of rape, there is no plausible reason to assume 
that the complainant party would permit the actual perpetrator to go 
unpunished and instead implicate him. Instances of substituting an innocent 
person for the actual offender are extremely rare, and nothing in the record 
supports such a possibility in this case. 
39. 
 
Child abuse cases are among the most challenging to detect 
and prosecute because the victim is often the sole witness. This difficulty is 
further compounded when the perpetrator is a parent or close family 
member. Courts must deal with these cases with extra care and sensitivity, 
balancing the need to protect children from abuse with the principles of 
fairness and due process.24  
40. 
 
A critical distinction must be drawn between a child who is 
simply a witness to an incident and a child who is the victim of the crime. 
The testimony of a child victim carries unique weight and requires a 
different approach, as the child directly bears the emotional, psychological, 
and physical impact of the offence. This distinction was emphasized in 
various cases. In Bashir Ahmed v. The State (PLD 1979 Karachi 147), the 
Sindh High Court held that the rule as to corroboration is one for the 
guidance of the courts and is not a rigid rule of law. Where the prosecutrix 
is a minor girl and has been the victim of outrage, she cannot be regarded 
as an accomplice, and her testimony should be evaluated according to the 
ordinary principles that stress its intrinsic worth and credibility. In such 
cases, the girl’s conduct may be sufficient to justify the acceptance of her 
version. In Raja Khurram Ali Khan v. Tayyaba Bibi (PLD 2020 SC 146), 
the Supreme Court of Pakistan criticized the trial court for failing to 
                                         
24 Imdad Ullah v. The State and another (2024 LHC 1462), and State of Rajasthan v. N. K. (accused) 
(AIR 2000 SC 1812). 

Crl. Appeal No.964/J/2023

distinguish between a child witness and a child victim, emphasizing that 
the latter’s testimony must be evaluated with specific regard to the trauma 
and circumstances they endured. The relevant excerpt is reproduced below: 
“We also find that the trial court failed to appreciate the distinction 
between a child witness, who is a witness of the crime, with one who is 
herself a victim of the crime. This lack of distinction led the trial Court 
to wrongly apply the principle of appreciating evidence of an ordinary 
witness of a crime, and not applying the standard of proof required for 
appreciating the testimony of a child witness, who is herself a victim of 
the said crime. Even otherwise, this Court found that the prosecution had 
produced sufficient evidence against the accused-convicts to safely 
discharge its ‘legal’ burden to prove the guilt of the accused, which was 
not rebutted by the accused-convicts by producing any evidence creating 
any doubt in the prosecution’s case.” 
41. 
 
The Supreme Court’s observations in Atif Zareef and others 
v. The State (PLD 2021 SC 550), though made in the context of a rape case 
involving a woman, are relevant to the present discussion. The Court 
acknowledged the inherent challenges in obtaining direct evidence for rape, 
noting that such crimes are usually committed in private, and no eyewitness 
testimony is available. In view of this reality, the Supreme Court 
emphasized that the courts should not insist on additional direct evidence to 
corroborate the victim’s testimony if it is found credible within the specific 
facts and circumstances of a case. In such instances, the victim’s testimony 
should alone suffice for the conviction of the accused. The Supreme Court 
stated that a rape victim stood on a higher pedestal than an injured witness 
because the latter only suffered physical harm, while the former endured 
psychological and emotional distress. 
42. 
 
In Imdad Ullah v. The State and another (2024 LHC 1462), a 
Division Bench of this Court stated that the evaluation of a child’s 
testimony as a victim of sexual abuse requires a thorough and balanced 
approach to protect the child’s rights and dignity while ensuring that the 
principles of justice are upheld. The Court recognized that sexual abuse 
may involve penetrative or non-penetrative acts, with the latter posing 
greater challenges due to an increased risk of false accusations in the 
societal context. Judges must determine the guilt or innocence of an 
accused by thoroughly examining all available evidence, considering the 
surrounding circumstances, and adhering to applicable legal standards. The 
absence of corroboration should not automatically discredit the child’s 
testimony in child abuse cases. The tender age of the child, combined with 

Crl. Appeal No.964/J/2023 
 
 
 
- 17 -
other case-specific circumstances, such as demeanour and the unlikelihood 
of tutoring, may make corroboration unnecessary. However, this is a 
factual consideration in each case. Courts must acknowledge that children 
may respond to the trauma of abuse in diverse ways, which may include 
confusion, fear, or mental anguish.  
43. 
 
In the present case, as discussed, S successfully withstood 
cross-examination and substantiated her case with consistent and 
unwavering evidence. Her account is corroborated by medical evidence. 
Muhammad Niaz’s testimony further supports her version of events, which 
we find reliable. Earlier in this judgment, we addressed and rejected  
Mr. Bhatti’s contention that Muhammad Niaz was a chance witness and 
lacked credibility. However, even if his testimony is excluded, the 
remaining evidence against Appellant Nazar Hussain is sufficient to sustain 
his conviction. 
44. 
 
We conclude that the prosecution has fully proved the guilt of 
Appellant Nazar Hussain. Hence, his conviction and sentence under section 
376(iii) PPC are upheld, and the appeal is dismissed to his extent. 
45. 
 
Next, we take up the case of Appellant Atta Ullah. In the 
application Exh. PB and FIR No. 497/2021 (Exh. PH), the Complainant 
claimed that Atta Ullah witnessed the occurrence. However, on 2.9.2021, 
seven days after the FIR was registered, he nominated him as an accused, 
alleging that he recorded a video of the rape incident using the cellphone of 
co-accused Jalal (since acquitted). The Complainant did not disclose the 
source of this information or explain the circumstances that prompted his 
implication.  
46. 
 
We note that on 26.8.2021, while giving history to Dr. Noor-
ul-Falah (PW-9), S stated that, at the time of the rape by Nazar Hussain, an 
unacquainted person recorded a video of the incident on a mobile phone. 
Then, during cross-examination at the trial, she categorically stated that she 
did not nominate Atta Ullah. 
47. 
 
Given the above, the identity of the individual who made the 
video is not established. While the PFSA reports (Exh. PL and Exh. PM) 
confirm the authenticity of the video, they do not link Appellant Atta Ullah 
to the offence or establish that he was the one who recorded it. 

Crl. Appeal No.964/J/2023 
 
 
 
- 18 -
48. 
 
It is essential to point out that the Investigating Officer, Nusrat 
Parveen/SI (PW-11), testified that the video in question was not recovered 
from Appellant Atta Ullah. She stated that the Complainant submitted it in 
a USB (P-6). In Ishtiaq Ahmed Mirza and others v. Federation of 
Pakistan and others (PLD 2019 SC 675), the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
has comprehensively outlined the requirements for the admissibility of 
audio and video tapes in evidence and the procedure for proving them in 
the court. The Supreme Court has inter alia mentioned that the source of 
such recordings must be clearly identified. In the present case, the 
prosecution did not provide any evidence regarding who transferred the 
video onto the USB, whether it was sourced from the internet, who 
uploaded or downloaded it, and when these actions took place. 
49. 
 
Ishtiaq Ahmed Mirza’s case further mandates that audio and 
video recordings must be played in court during the trial. This requirement 
is based on the fundamental right of the accused, or the person against 
whom they are to be used, to confront the evidence presented against them. 
In the present case, USB P-6 was not played in court during the trial, 
depriving Appellant Atta Ullah of his right to challenge or respond to its 
contents. Consequently, the said USB cannot be used as evidence against 
him, nor can any conviction be based on it. 
50. 
 
Abdul Shakoor 527/C (PW-7) testified that on 26.8.2021, the 
Investigating Officer handed over USB P-6 to him for obtaining pictures 
from the bazaar. He extracted five pictures, marked as P-1 to P-5, and later 
delivered them to her in the presence of Faria Khadim/LC (PW-6), and she 
took them into her possession through Recovery Memo Exh.PE. PW Abdul 
Shakoor’s testimony indicates that USB P-6 was never placed in safe 
custody. Under these circumstances, it would hold no evidentiary value 
even if it had been played before the trial court. 
51. 
 
We have examined pictures P-1 to P-5. Three of them depict a 
washroom, likely the place where the offence was committed, while the 
remaining two show the victim in a home setting. If these pictures 
accurately represent the contents of USB P-6, they do not contain anything 
incriminating that would warrant punishment for Appellant Atta Ullah.

In our considered opinion, the prosecution has failed to 
establish the charge against Appellant Atta Ullah. Hence, we allow this 
appeal to his extent and acquit him of the charge. He shall be released from 
jail forthwith if he is not required to be detained in some other case.
