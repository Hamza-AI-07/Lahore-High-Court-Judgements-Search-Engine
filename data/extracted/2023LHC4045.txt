Mr. Sattar Sahil and Falak Sher Bakhsh Gill AAGs with Mr. 
Qadeer Alam, AIG (Prisons). 
 
 
 
Petitioner applied for better class facility in the jail for her 
husband Omar Sarfraz Cheema who after his arrest in case FIR 
No.1271/2023 dated 10.05.2023 under sections 353/186/427/ 109/ 
302/ 324/290/ 291/147/ 148/149/ 152/153/ 505/ 120-B/ 452/ 436/ 395 
PPC registered at police station Gulberg, Lahore is confined in Central 
Jail, Kot Lakhpat, Lahore. The petitioner’s application dated 
15.05.2023 addressed to Superintendent Central Jail, Kot Lakhpat, 
Lahore/respondent No.3 was not decided upon which she filed a Writ 
Petition No.39605/2023 with the same grievance i.e. for providing B-
Class facilities to her husband; the said writ petition, however, vide 
order dated 12.06.2023 was disposed of in the terms that Additional 
Chief Secretary Home, Punjab was directed to decide the above-
referred application if pending, expeditiously and preferably within 
three days from the date of said order. As a net result vide order dated 
15th June, 2023 passed by Additional Chief Secretary (Home), finally 
the said application dated 15.05.2023 was dismissed. Hence, the 
instant writ petition. 
 
2. 
Learned Counsel for the Petitioner states that petitioner’s 
husband Mr. Omar Sarfraz Cheema belongs to a noble family and 
maintains a high social status being a politician and also remained 
Governor of the Punjab; therefore, under rule 248 read with rule 242 
of the Pakistan Prisons Rules, 1978, he is entitled for better class 

Writ Petition No.43904 of 2023. 2 
 
facility in the jail. His claim of such facility was also urged on the 
principle of parity too while placing on record the orders of 
Government of the Punjab Home Department passed in favour of ex-
Chief Minister Punjab, Ch. Pervaiz Elahi, and former Secretary, 
Punjab Assembly, Muhammad Khan Bhatti, the similarly placed 
prisoners. In support of his contention, he has placed reliance on cases 
reported as, “Mst. AASIA alias SALAAM SHAIKH Versus THE 
GOVERNMENT OF SINDH THROUGH HOME SECRETARY AND 4 
OTHERS” (1997 P Cr. L J 79); “ALI ASGHAR SHAH versus THE 
STATE” (PLD 2006 Karachi 162); “SHAHID BAWANI Versus 
GOVERNMENT OF SINDH through Home Secretary and another” 
(1993 P Cr. L J 2528). On the other hand, Learned Assistant Advocate 
General contested such claim while distinguishing the case of 
petitioner’s husband to other facilitated prisoners on the ground that 
he is involved in offences u/s 395 PPC and u/s 7 of Anti-terrorism Act, 
1997, and as per amendments of year 2018 in Prisons rules, such 
category of offenders is excluded from the benefit of rule 242 supra.  
 
3. 
Contentions were attended; relevant law applicable on the 
subject was perused in the light of Article-4 of the Constitution of the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. 
 
4. 
The petitioner’s husband is behind the bars in case FIR No. 
1271/2023 u/ss 353/186/427/ 109/302/ 324/290/291/147/ 148/ 
149/152/153/505/120-B/452/436/395 PPC, section-7 ATA, 1997 P/S 
Gulberg, Lahore; therefore, in order to ascertain his status as a 
prisoner, the relevant law “The Prisons Act, 1894” was examined 
which identifies the persons involved in criminal processes as 
mentioned in sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 3, as follows:- 
 
(2) “criminal prisoner” means any prisoner duly committed to custody 
under the writ, warrant or order of any Court or authority exercising 
criminal jurisdiction, or by order of a Court-martial:  
(3) “convicted criminal prisoner” means any criminal prisoner under 
sentence of a Court or Court-martial, and includes a person detained in 
prison under the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure, 1898, or under the Prisoners Act, 1900: 
 

Writ Petition No.43904 of 2023. 3 
 
From the above definition, it is clear that there are two broad 
categories of prisoners in a criminal process, i.e., under-trial prisoners 
(UTPs) and convicted prisoners. For their classification and 
separation, section 59 (17) of the Pakistan Prisons Act, 1894 
authorizes the government to frame rules. 
           
5. 
Pursuant to section 59 supra, Later Pakistan Prisons Rules, 
1978 were framed which identify three classes of facilities for 
convicted prisoners in jail as per rule 225 & two classes for under-trial 
prisoners as per rule 248, which are as under:- 
Classification of convicted prisoners  
Rule 225. (i) Convicted prisoners shall be classified into: -  
(a) superior class;  
(b) ordinary class; and  
(c) political class.  
(ii) Superior class includes A and B class prisoners. Ordinary 
class comprises of prisoners other than superior class.  
Political class comprises of prisoner who commit crimes not 
for personal gain but for political motives. This class is not 
criminal and does not require reformative or correctional 
treatment. 
                    
Classification of under-trial prisoners  
Rule248. (i) There shall be only two classes of under trial prisoners-  
 
(a) better class; and  
(b) ordinary class.  
(ii) better class will include those under-trial prisoners who by 
social status, education or habit of life have been accustomed to 
a superior mode of living and will correspond to A and B class 
of convicted prisoners.  
Ordinary class will include all others and will correspond to C 
class.  
(ii-a) Those undertrial prisoners who pass matriculation or 
higher examination in 1st Division during their stay in the jail 
shall be allowed better class jail facilities with effect from the 
date the result is announced.  
(iii) Before an under-trial prisoner is brought before a competent 
Court, it will be at the discretion of the Officer not below the 
rank of Assistant Superintendent/ Deputy Superintendent of 
police having jurisdiction in the area to properly classify him. 
After he is brought before the Court, he be classified by that 
Court, subject to the approval of the provincial Government. 
For assessment of their class, following qualifications and parameters 
were loaded in rule 242, which are reproduced for reference; it was 
primarily for convicted prisoners:- 

Writ Petition No.43904 of 2023. 4 
 
Rule 242 (i) Convicted shall be divided into three classes; A. B 
and C class. Class A will contain all prisoners who are—  
                                                        (a)    Casual prisoners of good character.  
(b)   By social status, education and habit of life have been 
accustomed to a superior mode of living and,  
(c)   Have not been convicted of offence involving elements of 
cruelty, moral degradation, personal greed, serious or 
premeditated violence, serious offence against property, 
offences relating to the possession of explosives, firearms and 
other dangerous weapons with object of committing or 
engaging an offence to be committed and abetment or 
incitement of offences falling within these sub-clauses.   
 
Prison Rules bereft of any express provision for restriction on under-
trial prisoners, as were in place for convicted prisoners, to seek better 
class facility: however, Police Rules, 1934 somehow or the other cater 
to the situation which reads as under; 
26-21A. Classification of under-trial prisoners. Under trial 
prisoners are divided into two classes based on previous standard 
of living. The classifying authority is the trying court subject to the 
approval of the District Magistrate; but during the period before a 
prisoner is brought before a competent court, discretion shall be 
exercised by the officer in charge of the Police Station concerned 
to classify him as either ‘better class’ or ‘ordinary’. Only those 
prisoners should be classified provisionally as ‘better class’ who by 
social status, education or habit of life have been accustomed to a 
superior mode of living. The fact, that the prisoner is to be tried for 
the commission of any particular class of offence is not to be 
considered. The possession of a certain degree of literacy is in 
itself not sufficient for ‘better class’ classification and no under-
trial prisoner shall be so classified whose mode of living does not 
appear to the Police Officer concerned to have been definitely 
superior to that of the ordinary run of the population, whether 
urban or rural. Under-trial prisoners classified as ‘better class’ shall 
be given the diet on the same scale as prescribed for A and B class 
convict prisoners in Rule 26-27(1).  
                                                      
(Emphasis supplied)                                        
 
6.  By virtue of Notification No. SO (R&P) 4-24/10(P-I) dated 1st 
April 2018, Government of the Punjab introduced amendment in 
Prisons Rules for a modified version of Rules 225 & 242 to club both 
the categories of convicted and under-trial prisoners in one form of 
sailing and rule 248 was omitted. What rule 225, after amendment, 
speaks is as under:- 
Rule 225: - Convicted and under-trial prisoners shall be classified as:- 
 
(a) 
better class; 
(b) 
ordinary class; or 
(c) 
political class 

Writ Petition No.43904 of 2023. 5 
 
Explanation: A convicted or under-trial prisoner, to be classified as “a 
political class, is a person who commits a crime for political and not 
for any criminal motive.” 
 
The relevant part of rule 242 is reproduced as under:- 
 
                                      Conditions for Classification of Prisoners

(2)   The better class facilities shall be awarded to a prisoner who; 
(a)     is not a habitual offender and has not been convicted 
more than twice; and 
(b)   is or has been a commissioned or gazetted officer of 
armed forces or civil services or is or has been a

or  
         Has in the preceding financial year paid minimum

(i)

(ii)

(iii)  
of anti-state activities; 
(iv) 
under section 10 and section 12 of the 
Prohibition (Enforcement of Hadd) Zina 
Ordinance, 1979 (VIII of 1979); 
(v) 
under section 364, section 364-A or section 
365-A, section 375, section 376, section 
377, section 376, section 391, section 392, 
section 394, section 395, section 396, 
section 397, section 402-A, section 402-B, 
section 402-C or under Chapter XV of the 
Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 (XLV of 1860); 
(vi) 
under the Explosive Substances Act, 1908 
(VI of 1908); 
(vii) 
under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1977 (XXVII 
of 1997) if he is a member of a proscribed or 
under-watch organization involved in a 
terrorism offence; 
(viii) under the Punjab Destitute and Neglected 
Children Act 2004 (XVIII of 2004) or any 
other law on the subject for the time being in 
force; 
(ix) 
under the Control of Narcotic Substances 
Act, 1997 (XXV of 1997); or 

Writ Petition No.43904 of 2023. 6 
 
(x) 
under the Security of Pakistan Act, 1952 
(XXXV of 1952).  
 
The contention of learned law officer was attended; according to him, 
petitioner’s husband is confined for an offence u/s 395 PPC and u/s 7 
of Anti-terrorism Act, 1997, therefore, pursuant to restriction cited 
above, the request for grant of better class jail facilities was rightly 
rejected by the Additional Chief Secretary (Home). 
7. 
It has been observed that better class facility to the petitioner’s 
husband was restricted by the authority by applying Rule 242 (2) (c) 
(v) supra, which though include section 395 PPC but not the section-7 
of Anti-terrorism Act, 1997. We have minutely examined the language 
used in clause (c) above which is reproduced again for ready reference 
as under; 
                 “(c)    has not been involved in, or convicted for, an offence:” 
In this clause, the words “has not been” are used; whereas Clause (a) 
of same subsection finds mentioned the word ‘is’ & ‘has not been’ and 
Clause (b) uses the words ‘is’ or ‘has been’. Both the words, ‘is’ or 
‘has been’ maintain different connotations and meanings; the use of 
word “is” obviously represents the present tense and would refer to 
something that is to be done or is being done in the present,  therefore, 
by not using the word ‘is’, rather simply inserting the word “has been” 
in clause (c) makes it clear that it talks about something done in the 
past, thus the instant clause would apply on an offender who remained 
involved previously in such offences and this clause is not specified 
for first offender. In the cases reported as “PRAMATHA NATH 
CHOWDHURY AND 17 OTHERS versus (1) KAMIR MONDAL, (2) 
ISMAIL MODAL, (3) BAJU MONDAL alias HAGURA MONDAL 
AND (4) DUKHA MONDAL” (PLD 1965 Supreme Court 434) and 
“THE INCOME-TAX OFFICER (INVESTIGATION) CIRCLE I, 
DACCA ANDANOTHER” (PLD 1970 Supreme Court 80) wherein the 
term “has been” in unequivocal terms was declared as denoting past 
time. No information was placed on record that petitioner’s husband 
maintains criminal history of like cases. Therefore, we have no 
hesitation to hold that order passed by Additional Chief Secretary 

Writ Petition No.43904 of 2023. 7 
 
(Home) is result of wrong appreciation of legal provision, 
misapplication of law as well as of discrimination. The similarly 
placed prisoners were already extended this facility, therefore, it is the 
constitutional right of the petitioner’s husband to enjoy the protection 
of law and to be treated in accordance with law which is an 
inalienable right of every citizen wherever he may be, as ordained 
under Article 4 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan. 1973, therefore, he cannot be deprived of such right. No 
doubt petitioner’s husband by his social status, education or habit of 
life has been accustomed to a superior mode of living; therefore, he is 
entitled to better class facility under the Pakistan Prisons Rules, 1978 
as cited above.  
8.   Consequently, this writ petition is allowed, order impugned is set 
aside with the direction to grant better class facility immediately to 
Mr. Omar Sarfraz Cheema, the petitioner’s husband.
