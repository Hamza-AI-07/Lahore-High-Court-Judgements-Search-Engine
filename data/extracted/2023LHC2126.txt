MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J. Through 
instant Reference Application under Section 196 of the Customs 
Act, 1969 (“the Act of 1969”), following question of law, as was 
formulated vide order dated 07.11.2022, asserted to have arisen out 
of impugned judgment dated 18.08.2022, passed by learned 
Customs Appellate Tribunal, Lahore (“Appellate Tribunal”) has 
been pressed and argued for our opinion:- 
Whether the notice under Section 32 of the Customs Act, 1969 
could be issued from where the contravened or smuggled goods 
are recovered or at a place where these goods were imported 
(Karachi)? 
 
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that staff of Directorate of 
Intelligence & Investigation Customs, Faisalabad intercepted a 
truck / trailer No.TLD-534 loaded with container No.CAIU-
477654-5, a consignment of cloth imported by respondent No.1. 
The driver showed a copy of Goods Declaration showing import 
and clearance of 14,860 Kg of Un-Dyed Unfinished Fabric in Bales 
under PCT Heading 5407.5100, with assessed value of US$ 3.8/Kg

as against declared value of US$ 3/Kg. However, customs seal 
affixed on the container was broken and inside the container, bales 
of Georgette Chiffon fabric was found. The truck / trailer along 
with loaded goods was detained for further verification. A sample 
of fabric was drawn and was sent to the Customs Laboratory at 
Faisalabad Dryport for confirmation of its description / PCT 
Heading etc. After thorough examination, the fabrics / goods were 
found as Georgette Chiffon with weight of 15,740 Kg and its 
customs value was determined as US$ 10.5/Kg. The fabric was 
seized and seizure report was sent to adjudication officer, who 
issued Show Cause Notice to respondents No.1 & 2 & others, 
which culminated in passing of order-in-original dated 21.02.2021, 
whereby seized goods were ordered to be released against payment 
of duty & taxes on the value of US$ 5.48/Kg instead of US$ 
10.5/Kg, as the matter was subjudice before valuation committee. 
Respondent was also directed to furnish bank guarantee of 
differential duty & taxes of assessed value of US$ 5.48/Kg, as 
assessed by the Collectorate of East, Karachi till finalization of 
matter by the valuation committee, with the understanding that if 
any liability is determined, the same would be recovered from the 
importer. The seized vehicle was also confiscated, however lawful 
owner was given option to redeem his vehicle along with container 
against redemption fine of Rs.50,000/-.  Feeling aggrieved, 
applicant-department filed appeal before learned Appellate 
Tribunal, which was dismissed and the show cause notice as well as 
order-in-original was set aside having no legal effect, vide 
impugned judgment dated 18.08.2022. Hence, instant Reference 
Application.  
3. 
Learned Legal Advisor for applicant-department, inter-alia, 
contended that respondent No.3 has no jurisdiction to adjudicate 
and decide the allegation of mis-declaration attracting offence under 
Section 32 of the Act of 1969 as violation had been committed at 

 
 
Customs Reference No.66929 of 2022 
3
import stage at Karachi port, resulting into short levy of duties, 
thus, the matter fell beyond the jurisdiction of respondent No.3.  
4. 
Contrarily, learned counsel for respondents defends the 
impugned decision by supporting the reasons advanced by learned 
Appellate Tribunal. 
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused.  
6. 
The matter in hand requires determination of powers of 
cognizance, especially jurisdiction of adjudication, of customs 
officials deputed at Port / Station of Entry and Port / Station of 
Destination.  In the instant case, the goods arrived at Karachi (Port / 
Station of Entry) and after clearance the same were transported to 
Faisalabad (Port / Station of Destination), where a sample of fabric 
was drawn and sent to Laboratory, followed by seizure, 
confiscation and demand of differential of duty & taxes. Needless 
to say that if any mis-declaration is made by the importer, it is 
deemed to be in contravention to the provisions of section 32(1) of 
the Act of 1969, however this provision does not provide any 
guidance in respect of jurisdiction for adjudication by the customs 
officials. This provision read with Rules 335 & 338 merely 
empowers the customs officials at the port of entry to examine 
whether the declaration made is correct and goods correspond to the 
declaration. These provisions give authority to customs officials at 
entry stage to take cognizance of the contravention, if any, but it 
will not confer the powers of adjudication as well which will 
remain with the customs officials posted at the port of destination. 
Reference can be made to Collector of Customs v. M/s. Ayaz Ahmed 
(2007 PTCL 601). 
7. 
Vide 
Notification 
No. 
S.R.O. 
886(I)/2012, 
dated 
18.07.2012, 
the 
Collectors, 
Collectorate 
of 
Customs 
(Adjudication) have been specified to adjudicate the cases 
relating to areas falling in the jurisdiction of the Collectorates 
and Directorates set out therein. In Para 2 of the Notification, it is 
mentioned that the cases made out by the Directorates General of 

 
 
Customs Reference No.66929 of 2022 
4
Intelligence and Investigation-FBR, Post Clearance Audit, 
Internal Audit (Customs) or by any other agency entrusted with 
the powers under section 6 of the Customs Act, 1969, falling in 
the jurisdiction of the Collectorates or Directorates mentioned in 
column (3) of the Table above, shall be adjudicated by the 
respective Collectorates of Adjudication mentioned in column (2) 
of the said Table. Vide Circular No.11(1)S(Lit HC)Cus/2018 
dated 01.11.2018, issued by Federal Board of Revenue, it was 
clarified that the Collectorate of Adjudication having jurisdiction 
as per SRO 886(I)/2012 dated 18.07.2012 may adjudicate the 
contravention cases relating to the areas falling in the 
jurisdiction of the Model Customs Collectorate from where such 
goods were imported and cleared. Subsequently, vide Circular 
No.11(1)S(Lit HC)Cus/18 dated 12.01.2019, issued by Federal 
Board of Revenue, it was decided that in cases, where seizure has 
been affected by D.G. I&I-Customs or any Customs field 
formation including any investigation done connected with the 
subject seizure, the case will be adjudicated by the Collectorate 
or Adjudication in whose jurisdiction the case has been affected. 
However, if separate contravention case(s) are tailored-out in 
furtherance of investigation then the Collectorate of Adjudication 
will adjudicate the case(s) in whose jurisdiction such clearances 
had taken place. 
 
The case in hand is not a contravention case rather in the 
instant case, the cause of action arose when the staff of 
Directorate of Intelligence & Investigation Customs, Faisalabad 
found the customs seal broken and inside the container, bales of 
Georgette Chiffon fabric were found, followed by laboratory 
examination and seizure. In such circumstances when seizure was 
made at Port / Station of Destination (Faisalabad), the Collector 
Collectorate 
of 
Customs 
(Adjudication), 
Faisalabad 
had 
jurisdiction in the matter to make adjudication, assessment, 
confiscation and penalty etc., in the light of afore-referred 

 
 
Customs Reference No.66929 of 2022 
5
Notifications and the jurisdiction cannot be objected to merely 
because the goods were initially cleared by the Port / Station of 
entry.  
8. 
In view of the above, we are of the considered opinion that 
show cause notice having been issued and adjudication made by the 
Collector (Adjudication) available at the Port / Point of Destination 
were lawful and not liable to be set at naught on the misconceived 
plea of being beyond territorial jurisdiction. Therefore, our answer 
to the proposed question is that adjudication under Section 32 of the 
Act of 1969 was rightly made by the customs authority available at 
the Port / Station of Destination (Faisalabad) i.e. the Collector, 
Collectorate of Customs (Adjudication), Faisalabad.  
 
The instant Reference Application is decided in favour of 
applicant-department and against respondent No.1. 
9. 
Office shall send a copy of this judgment under seal of the 
Court to the Appellate Tribunal as per Section 196(5) of the 
Customs Act, 1969.
