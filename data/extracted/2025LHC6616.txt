MALIK JAVID IQBAL WAINS, J.  This judgment shall decide 
the instant Custom Reference Application along with connected Reference 
Applications bearing Nos.28738 of 2024, 28739 of 2024, 28741 of 2024, 
29457 of 2024, 29458 of 2024, 29459 of 2024, and 29460 of 2024, filed by 
applicant-department and respondent-taxpayer, as all these matters involve 
common question of law, though arising from the separate judgments.  
2.  
The instant Reference Application, being the lead case, filed under 
Section 196 of the Customs Act, 1969 (hereinafter “the Act”), by the 
Director Custom House, Lahore (“applicant-department”) against M/s 
Duty Free Shop Limited, Sialkot (“respondent-taxpayer”) seeking 
opinion of this Court on the following question of law, purported to have 
arisen from the judgment dated 28.11.2023 (hereinafter “impugned 
judgment”) passed by the learned Customs Appellate Tribunal, Bench-I, 
Lahore (hereinafter “the Appellate Tribunal”): -  
 
“Whether the learned Tribunal could pass the 
impugned judgment having difference of opinion 
between the learned Members without resorting to 
mandatory procedure provided under sub section (5) 
of Section 194-C of the Customs Act, 1969?” 
3.  
Conversely, in connected Reference Application, second lead case, 
bearing No.29457 of 2024, the respondent-taxpayer has approached this 
Court seeking a declaration to the effect that the opinion rendered by the 

                              Custom Reference No.28736 of 2024                                                                        2 
 
 
 
learned Member (Judicial-I) be treated as the majority view of the learned 
Appellate Tribunal, in light of the orders dated 15.01.2024 and 23.01.2024 
passed by the learned Referee Member. 
4. 
Briefly stated, the facts of the lead case are that during audit of 
respondent-taxpayer, the discrepancies/irregularities and evasion of duty 
and taxes for the period from July 2006 to June 2007 were detected in 
record maintenance, Sales and Stock Registers, Mismatching of Sales 
Record, Suppression of Sales Value, Assessable Value being lower than 
the import value and sales value, removal of goods in commercial quantity, 
sales against fake invoices and non-deposit of foreign exchange. 
Resultantly, show cause notice was issued by the applicant-department to 
respondent-taxpayer. After adjudicating the matter, Collector of Customs 
(Adjudication), Lahore vide Orders in Original Nos.34, 35, 36 & 37 of 
2014, dated 23.06.2014 upheld the charges contained in the show cause 
notice and directed respondent-taxpayer to pay the evaded amount of duty 
and taxes and also imposed penalty upon the respondent.  
5. 
Feeling aggrieved, the respondent-taxpayer filed an appeal before 
the Appellate Tribunal, which after hearing arguments from both parties, 
reserved judgment on 11.09.2023, and was subsequently announced on 
28.11.2023. The impugned judgment was rendered by the Member 
(Technical), wherein the appeal filed by respondent-taxpayer was 
dismissed. However, the second Member i.e. Member (Judicial), instead of 
concurring with the aforesaid judgment, recorded a dissenting note and 
allowed appeal of respondent-taxpayer. 
6. 
In view of the difference of opinion, the Chairman of the Appellate 
Tribunal referred the matter to another Member (Technical) of the Lahore 
Bench, acting as the Referee Member. The Referee Member concurred with 
the view expressed by the Member (Judicial), through two separate orders 
dated 15.01.2024 and 23.01.2024, thereby resulting in the appeal being 
allowed. 
7. 
Learned counsel for the applicant-department contends that the 
requirements of Section 194-C(5) of the Act, have not been complied with. 

                              Custom Reference No.28736 of 2024                                                                        3 
 
 
 
It is argued that where the members of the Appellate Tribunal are divided in 
their opinion, the law enjoins upon them to formulate the precise points of 
divergence and refer the matter to the Chairman for nomination of a third 
Member to resolve the difference. In the present case, however, the points 
of difference were not duly formulated and as such the prescribed procedure 
was not followed. Learned counsel maintains that the impugned judgment 
suffers from legal infirmity and is not sustainable in law. Reliance has been 
placed on the judgments rendered by this Court in Messrs VINTAK PIPE 
INDUSTRIES through Proprietor Versus CUSTOMS APPELLATE 
TRIBUNAL and 3 others (2018 P T D 1823) and DEPUTY COLLECTOR 
SALES TAX versus COLLECTOR, EXCISE AND SALES TAX and others 
(2002 P T D 2570). 
8. 
Learned counsel for the respondent-taxpayer has supported the 
impugned order passed by the Referee Member, contending that the 
Chairman of the Appellate Tribunal, after ensuring due compliance with the 
mandatory requirements of Section 194C(5) of the Act, lawfully referred 
the matter to the Referee Member for resolution. It is further submitted that 
the Referee Member concurred with the opinion expressed by the Judicial 
Member through two separate orders dated 15.01.2024 and 23.01.2024. 
Hence, no illegality can be attributed to the rendering of the impugned 
decision. The learned counsel has, therefore, prayed that the impugned 
judgment be declared as the majority opinion of the Tribunal, as constituted 
by the Judicial Member and the Referee Member. 
9. 
We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have carefully 
examined the record. 
10. 
The moot point requiring determination by this Court is whether the 
difference of opinion between the Member (Technical) and the Member 
(Judicial) of the Appellate Tribunal was resolved in strict conformity with 
the mandatory procedure prescribed under Section 194-C(5) of the Act; 
whether the points of difference were properly formulated by the then 
Members; whether the subsequent referral to the Referee Member was 
duly made in accordance with law; and whether the two separate orders 

                              Custom Reference No.28736 of 2024                                                                        4 
 
 
 
dated 15.01.2024 and 23.01.2024 passed by the Referee Member were in 
compliance with the statutory requirements of the majority opinion of the 
Tribunal. 
11. 
Perusal of the impugned judgment passed by Member (Technical) of 
the Appellate Tribunal, it is observed that a detailed judgment dated 
28.11.2023, comprising 24 pages was delivered, whereby the appeals filed 
by the respondent-taxpayer were dismissed, and the Orders-in-Original 
passed by the Adjudicating Authority/Collector (Appeals) were upheld. 
Notably, the Member (Judicial) authored a separate dissenting note 
spanning 40 pages, wherein he accepted the appeals and declared the 
impugned orders passed by the authorities below to be void ab initio and 
ultra vires.  
12. 
The Referee Member, after providing an opportunity of hearing to 
both parties on 15.01.2024, concurred with the opinion expressed by the 
Member (Judicial). However, subsequently, on 23.01.2024, another order 
was passed by the Referee Member, whereby the appeals filed by the 
respondents were allowed, resulting in the setting aside of the Orders-in-
Original passed by the Adjudicating Authority. It is significant to note that 
both orders issued by the learned Referee Member comprise only a single 
page each and are entirely devoid of any reasoning or discussion addressing 
the points of difference between the two original Members. Furthermore, 
the subsequent order dated 23.01.2024 contains no explanation as to why a 
second order was passed, nor does it furnish any reasons for departing from 
the earlier concurrence.  
13. 
Now, the pivotal question emerging for determination in the present 
reference is whether, upon the occurrence of a difference of opinion 
between the learned Members of the Appellate Tribunal, the points of 
difference were duly formulated in accordance with the mandatory 
requirements of Section 194-C(5) of the Act, and whether the Referee 
Member proceeded to address and decide the matter in conformity with the 
procedure prescribed therein. For better understanding, the relevant 
provision is reproduced below: 

                              Custom Reference No.28736 of 2024                                                                        5 
 
 
 
Section 194-C – Procedure of Appellate Tribunal 
“(5) If the members of a Bench differ in opinion on any 
point, the point shall be decided according to the opinion 
of the majority, if there is a majority, but if the members 
are equally divided, they shall state the point or points 
on which they differ and the case shall be referred by the 
Chairman for hearing on such point or points by one or 
more of the other members of the Appellate Tribunal, 
and such point or points shall be decided according to 
the opinion of the majority of the members of the 
Appellate Tribunal who have heard the case including 
those who first heard it.” 
Provided that, where the members of a Special Bench 
are equally divided, the points on which they differ shall 
be decided by the Chairman. 
 
 
 
         (Underlined for supplying emphasis) 
14. 
Upon perusal of the record and a plain reading of Section 194-C(5) 
of the Act, it is evident that the statutory provision contemplates a specific 
procedure to be followed in the event of a difference of opinion between 
the Members of a Bench. The legislative intent is unambiguous, the 
Members shall first formulate the precise point or points of difference, 
which shall then be referred by the Chairman of the Appellate Tribunal to 
one or more other Members for resolution. The final decision must reflect 
the opinion of the majority of the Members who have heard the case, 
including those who originally constituted the Bench. This framework 
ensures adjudication in accordance with law and upholds the principle of 
collective decision-making. 
15. 
In the present matter, however, the Appellate Tribunal has failed to 
adhere to the mandatory procedural requirements set forth under the above 
provision. The Members of the original Bench did not record or frame the 
specific point or points on which they differed, as required under Section 
194-C(5) of the Act. In absence of duly formulated points of difference, 
the matter was nonetheless referred by the Chairman to a Referee Member, 
contrary to the statutory mandate, the Referee Member proceeded to 
dispose of the matter without identifying or addressing any specific point 
or points of divergence and without assigning independent or reasoned 
justification for concurring with either Member of the original Bench. 

                              Custom Reference No.28736 of 2024                                                                        6 
 
 
 
16. 
These lapses amount to a clear violation of the mandatory procedure 
prescribed by law. Section 194-C(5) of the Act expressly provides that in 
the event of disagreement among Members, they shall articulate the point 
or points on which they differ. Only such point or points shall be referred 
by the Chairman for hearing by one or more other Members of the 
Appellate Tribunal. The matter is then to be decided in accordance with 
the opinion of the majority of Members who have heard the case, including 
those who originally heard it. In view of the foregoing, the procedure 
adopted by the Appellate Tribunal is legally unsustainable and is vitiated 
by non-compliance with statutory requirements.  
17. 
Further, the record discloses three distinct and mutually inconsistent 
opinions: (i) the original judgment authored by the Member (Technical), 
(ii) the dissenting note of the Member (Judicial), and (iii) the brief, 
unreasoned orders of the Referee Member. These cannot collectively 
constitute a “majority opinion” as contemplated under Section 194-C(5) of 
the Act, as the majority must emerge from a procedurally valid 
formulation of points of difference and their resolution, which is absent 
here. Such a course of action undermines the statutory structure, defeats 
the legislative intent behind collective adjudication, and constitutes a 
material irregularity going to the root of the proceedings. 
18. 
Accordingly, the impugned judgment is vitiated by procedural 
illegality and cannot be sustained in law. Reliance is placed on the 
judgment rendered by this court reported as Messrs VINTAK PIPE 
INDUSTRIES through Proprietor Versus CUSTOMS APPELLATE 
TRIBUNAL and 3 others (2018 P T D 1823), which reiterates and fortifies 
the principle earlier enunciated in judgment passed by this Court in 
DEPUTY COLLECTOR SALES TAX versus COLLECTOR, EXCISE AND 
SALES TAX and others (2002 PTD 2570). Relevant portion of said 
judgment is reproduced hereinafter: - 
“4(3) In the light of provisions of subsection (5) of section 
194-C of the Customs Act, 1969 a reference to learned 
Chairman for referring the matter to a third Member could 
not have been made by the learned Member without 
recording the point or points on which they differed. These 

                              Custom Reference No.28736 of 2024                                                                        7 
 
 
 
points are required to be formulated in order to identify the 
exact nature and extent of difference of opinion between the 
Members. The formulation of these points is in the nature of 
issues framed in civil suits bringing out the material 
proposition of law or fact on which the learned Members 
had differed. 
On formulation of all these points which has to be by 
agreement of the Members and signed by them the matter is 
submitted to the learned Chairman "for hearing on such 
point or points by one or more of the other Members of the 
Tribunal". Once this has been done and the third Member 
has heard the parties and expressed his opinion the point or 
points are to be decided in accordance with the opinion of 
the majority. The final result or decision in accordance with 
the opinion of the majority is to be recorded and signed by 
all the Members who had heard the case. 
19. 
In the present case, both Members of the Appellate Tribunal, whose 
opinions were at variance, have since been retired. In the absence of any 
specifically formulated points of difference between them and considering 
the detailed and independent reasoning set out in their respective opinions, 
it is not feasible at this stage for the Appellate Tribunal to identify or frame 
such points from their extensive and divergent findings. Most importantly, 
the governing statute does not prescribe any procedural mechanism to 
address such a situation. Consequently, this Court is left with no 
alternative but to set aside the impugned judgment/orders passed by the 
learned Members of the Tribunal.  
20. 
For the reasons recorded above, the impugned judgment passed by 
the learned Member (Technical) of the Tribunal, including the orders 
rendered by the dissenting Member and the Referee Member are hereby set 
aside. The matter is remanded to the Chairman of the Appellate Tribunal, 
where the appeals filed by the respondent-taxpayer shall be deemed to be 
pending before the Tribunal, who shall proceed to fix them for a fresh 
hearing and decide the same in accordance with law. In the event that a 
difference of opinion again arises between the Members hearing the 
matter, the Chairman shall ensure strict compliance with the mandatory 
requirements of Section 194-C(5) of the Act. 
21. 
The instant Reference Application along with connected reference 
applications stand disposed of in the above terms, and proposed question 

                              Custom Reference No.28736 of 2024                                                                        8 
 
 
 
is answered accordingly. The Office is directed to send a copy of this 
judgment to the Customs Appellate Tribunal, Lahore, in compliance with 
Section 196(10) of the Act.
