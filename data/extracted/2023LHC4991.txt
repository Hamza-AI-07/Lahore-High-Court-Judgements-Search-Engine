3. 
It is contended by the petitioner that in his 
aforementioned experiment, if he dies, no one would be 
responsible for his death. If he remains alive, the 
Government be directed to follow his prescription to 
cure cancer patients to avoid exorbitant medical costs 
for the treatment and cure of such patients. According 

2 
               W.P.No.56980 of 2023 
to him, the petitioner has secured these prescriptions 
from the wisdom of saints which he believes is the best 
way for curing cancer patients.

Learned

Officer 
has 
questioned 
maintainability of the tiled Writ Petition.  
5. 
Heard. 
6. 
Prayer of the petitioner cannot be allowed for the 
following reasons:  
(i) A writ in the nature of mandamus in terms of 
Article 199(1)(a)(i) of the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 („Constitution‟) 
visualizes issuance of direction, inter alia, to a 
person performing functions in connections with 
affairs of the Federation,  a Province or a Local 
Government to do what law requires him to do. It 
has been held by the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
in the case of The Secretary Punjab Public 
Service Commission, Lahore and others v. Aamir 
Hayat and others (2019 SCMR 124) that 
jurisdiction of the High Court under the said 
provision is limited to ensuring that the state 
functionaries do what they are required by law to 
do. Unless an act or omission of the state 
functionary falls within the said parameter, High 
Court would be overstepping its jurisdiction in 
issuing any direction. The Petitioner failed to 
point out any provision in law conferring 
authority upon Government of the Punjab or the 
District Administration to grant the permission 
sought by him. 
(ii) Although attempt to commit suicide has been 
decriminalized with effect from 28th December 
2022 when the offence under section 325 of the 

3 
               W.P.No.56980 of 2023 
Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 („PPC‟) was omitted 
through Criminal Laws (Amendment) Act, 2022 
(Act XXXVII of 2022), however, the offence of 
negligent conduct with respect to poisonous 
substance, as prescribed in section 284 of the 
PPC, remains on the statute book in terms 
whereof whoever does with any poisonous 
substance, any act in a manner so rash or 
negligent or negligent as to endanger human life, 
or to be likely to cause hurt or injury to any 
person or knowingly or negligently omits to take 
such order with any poisonous substance in his 
possession as is sufficient to guard against 
probable danger to human life from such 
poisonous substance, shall be punished with 
imprisonment of either description for a term 
which may extend to six months, or with fine, 
which may extend to three thousand rupees, or 
with both. Hurt caused by corrosive substance, as 
prescribed in section 336A of the PPC, is another 
offence in terms whereof whoever, with the 
intention or knowingly causes or attempts to 
cause hurt by means of a corrosive substance or 
any substance which is deleterious to human 
body when it is swallowed, inhaled, comes to 
contact or received into human body is said to 
cause hurt by corrosive substance. In the 
statutory explanation, “corrosive substance” for 
the said offence has been defined to include 
poison. This Court cannot issue the direction 
sought where the same carries potential risk of 
commission of any offence in the statute book. 

4 
               W.P.No.56980 of 2023 
(iii) Schedule II of the Drug Regulatory Authority of 
Pakistan Act, 2012 („DRAP Act‟) specifies 
prohibitions 
which 
constitute 
offences 
punishable under Schedule III, as mandated by 
Section 27 of that Act. Sub-sections (xxxvi) & 
(ii) of Section 2 of the DRAP Act respectively 
define “therapeutic goods” to include drugs or 
alternative medicine or medical devices or 
biologicals or other related products as may be 
notified by the Authority and “alternative 
medicine” to mean a product used exclusively in 
Homeopathic, Unani, Ayuverdic, Biochemic, 
Chinese or other traditional system of treatment. 
Section B of Schedule II prescribes offences for 
the control of advertisement. It postulates that no 
person shall himself or by any other person on 
his behalf advertise, except in accordance with 
such conditions as may be prescribed, (a) any 
therapeutic good; (b) any substance used or 
prepared for use in accordance with the 
Ayuverdic, Unani, Homeopathic, Chinese or 
Biochemic system of treatment or any other 
substance or mixture of substances as maybe 
prescribed; (c) any remedy, treatment or offer of 
a treatment for any disease. For the purpose of 
the aforementioned prohibition, an explanation 
has been enacted to define “advertise” to mean to 
make 
any 
representation 
by 
any 
means 
whatsoever for the purpose of promoting directly 
or indirectly the sale or disposal of it therapeutic 
good, is substance or a mixture of substances, 
remedy or a treatment except the display of 
signboards for the clinic, a dispensary or a 

5 
               W.P.No.56980 of 2023 
hospital or set other institution offering 
treatment. 
What the petitioner seeks in relief in the instant 
case is surely a public representation of his act of 
consumption of a substance that he believes 
would not cause his death but may cure and 
recover cancer patients.  The relief sought by the 
petitioner, if allowed, is not only likely to be in 
violation of these prohibitions constituting 
offences but perpetuate anarchy in the field of 
drugs.  
(iv) The poisons Act, 1919 has been enacted to 
regulate importation, possession and sale of 
poisons. Section 4 of that legislation confers 
power upon the Provincial Government to 
regulate possession of any specified poison in 
any local area and in that regard, it also 
prescribes 
an 
offence 
punishable 
with 
imprisonment for a term which may extend to 
one year or fine specified therein. Section 5 of 
the said Act draws a presumption that any 
substance specified as poison in a rule framed 
under section 8 of the Poisons Act is deemed to 
be a poison for the purpose of that Act. 
Additionally, storage, use in drugs and labelling 
of poisonous substances is regulated by the 
Drugs Act, 1976 and rule 20  of the Punjab Drug 
Rules, 2007. Issuance of the direction prayed for 
may also have the effect of undermining the role 
and authority of the regulator under the 
aforementioned laws. 
(v) On Court query, the petitioner confirmed that he 
was not himself a cancer patient, therefore, it is 

6 
               W.P.No.56980 of 2023 
not a case of euthanasia i.e. the practice of 
ending the life of a terminally ill patient to limit 
his or her experience of great pain and suffering. 
In some countries of the world including India, 
there is judicial acceptance of a degree of 
euthanasia 
in 
recognition 
of 
persons‟ 
fundamental right to die with dignity. Several 
directions in that regard were issued by the 
Supreme Court of India in the case of Common 
Cause (A Registered Society) v. Union of India 
and another [(2018) 5 SCC 1],  some of which 
were subsequently modified vide order dated 
24.01.2023 
on 
Miscellaneous 
Application 
No.1699 of 2019 in the aforementioned case to 
simplify the procedure for executing living will.  
Be that as it may, Islam is the State religion of 
Pakistan, which is manifest from Article 2 of the 
Constitution. Besides an overwhelming majority 
of Muslims, a sizeable population of Pakistanis 
consists of non-Muslims. If at all and how far the 
plea of euthanasia is tenable in Pakistan in the 
context of provisions of Articles 2A, 14 and 20 
of the Constitution is not a matter in issue here, 
therefore, it would not be appropriate for this 
Court to delve into that question. However, when 
the petitioner is not a terminally ill patient and 
the permission is not being sought to limit his 
experience of great pain and suffering rather for 
the purpose of life risking experiment to create 
public spectacle, no direction for the grant of 
such permission is warranted by law. Needless to 
observe here that such permission, if issued, may 

7 
               W.P.No.56980 of 2023 
disturb public order and encourage others to 
indulge in such unlawful practice.               
(vi) It is well settled that the exercise of jurisdiction 
under Article 199 of the Constitution is 
discretionary. The discretionary nature of such 
remedy is not only manifest from the text of 
Article 199 but also the precedents of the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the cases of 
Rehmatullah v. Hameeda Begum (1986 SCMR 
1561); Member (S & R) / Chief Settlement 
Commissioner, Board of Revenue Punjab, 
Lahore and another v. Syed Ashfaque Ali and 
another (PLD 2003 SC 132). It would be 
inappropriate for this Court to issue any direction 
to the respondents to allow the petitioner relief 
qua publicly consuming any substance which is 
not registered with the Drug Regulatory 
Authority of Pakistan after trials and evaluation 
of its safety and efficacy when the same not only 
constitutes violation of law but criminal offences. 
(vii)The instant petition appears to be more of a 
publicity stunt behind the veil of public interest, 
which cannot be entertained and is liable to be 
dismissed outrightly. Reliance in this regard is 
placed on the case of Dr. Akhtar Hassan Khan v. 
Federation of Pakistan (2012 SCMR 455). 
  
7. 
For the foregoing reasons, this writ petition is 
dismissed in limine being devoid of any merit.
