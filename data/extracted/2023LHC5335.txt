Unnecessary details apart, the facts, as 
divulged in this petition, are that the petitioner, on 
25.02.2008, filed an application for retirement of his 
father, namely, Ali Akbar, who was serving as Sub 
Inspector in Punjab Police, district Jhang. The 
District Police Officer, Jhang (respondent No.2) 
referred the matter to the Medical Superintendent, 
District Headquarters Hospital, Jhang, for medical 
examination of father of the petitioner. The Medical 
Board, constituted to know the exact medical 
position of father of the petitioner, opined that father 
of the petitioner was unfit for further service. As 
father of the petitioner was not retired on medical 
grounds, he was constrained to file application, on 
05.05.2008, for his retirement, w.e.f. 01.07.2008, on 
completion of qualifying service of 25 years. The 
petitioner, being son of deceased government

2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits 
that on application submitted by the petitioner 
Medical Board was constituted which submitted its 
report 
which 
was 
formally 
translated 
into 
Invalidation Certificate, bearing No.2526 dated 
17.03.2008, thus, father of the petitioner retired from 
government service on medical grounds, hence, the 
petitioner is entitled for appointment under rule 17-A 
of the Punjab Civil Servants (Appointment and 
Conditions of Service) Rules, 1974. 
3. 
Leaned Law Officer, while opposing the 
submissions made by learned counsel for the 
petitioner, submits that since the petitioner has 
concealed material facts from this Court he is not 
entitled to equitable relief. While referring to the 
report and parawise comments submitted on behalf of 
respondent No.2, learned Law Officer submits that 
since the petitioner failed to prove countersigning of 
acclaimed Invalidation Certificate of his father and

own request, the petitioner is not entitled for 
appointment under rule 17-A ibid. 
4. 
In exercise of his right of rebuttal, learned 
counsel for the petitioner submits that according to 
the entries in Service Book of the petitioner, which 
was duly signed by respondent No.2, father of the 
petitioner retired from government service on 
medical grounds, w.e.f. 01.07.2008, thus, stance of 
the department that father of the petitioner retired on 
qualifying service, is contrary to the record; that 
since Office of the Inspector General of Police, 
Punjab, Lahore (respondent No.1) and that of 
respondent No.2 are not on the same page, in respect 
of class of retirement of father of the petitioner, the 
stance of the petitioner is to be treated as correct; that 
according to Notification bearing No. 12802-6, dated 
30.06.2018, father of the petitioner was retired from 
service on medical grounds, thus, no contrary 
interpretation can be introduced by the respondents 
and that since application, dated 05.05.2008, referred 
by learned Law Officer, is bereft of signatures of

I have heard learned counsel for the parties at 
considerable length and have also gone through the 
documents, annexed with this petition. 
6. 
The criteria for issuance and completion of 
Invalidation Certificate in favour of a government 
servant, who has been examined by the Medical 
Board, upon the request of his/her parent department, 
has been encapsulated in Notification, dated 
08.08.2017, issued by the Additional Secretary, 
Primary & Secondary Healthcare Department, Govt. 
of the Punjab, operative part whereof is imaged 
below for ready reference: -

According to the afore-imaged Notification after 
issuance of Invalidation Certificate by the Medical 
Superintendent concerned, on the basis of opinion of 
the Medical Board, same is to be forwarded to the 
Director General, Directorate General of Health 
Services, Punjab, for countersigning and if the same 
is countersigned then it is valid for retirement of 
government servant on medical grounds. Insofar as 
the case in hand is concerned, the Medical 
Superintendent, 
District 
Headquarters 
Hospital, 
Jhang, through communication bearing No.13518, 
dated 28.09.2016, referred the matter to the Director 
General, Directorate  General  of Health Services, 
Punjab, Lahore, for verification of Invalidation 
Certificate of father of the petitioner. Further, 
respondent No.2, through communications bearing 
Nos.8111/HC-E, dated 05.10.2018, also referred the 
matter to the Director General, Directorate General of 
Health Services, Punjab, Lahore for verification of 
the Invalidation Certificate issued in favour of father 
of the petitioner. The Director General, Directorate 
General of Health Services, Punjab, Lahore, through 
communication bearing No.5663/General, dated 
19.10.2018, conveyed to respondent No.2 that since

no record relating to Invalidation Certificate, 
produced by father of the petitioner, was found the 
same was fake and bogus. In this backdrop, the 
Invalidation Certificate of father of the petitioner has 
become disputed. It is well established by now that 
disputed questions of facts cannot be adjudicated 
upon in these proceedings rather for the said purpose 
jurisdiction lies with the relevant forum, hence, no 
relief can be granted to the petitioner.  
7. 
Another important aspect of the matter is that 
according to own showing of the petitioner, initially, 
he filed an application, on 25.02.2008, for retirement 
of his father on medical grounds whereupon matter 
was referred to the Medical Superintendent, District 
Headquarters Hospital, Jhang for constitution of 
Medical Board, through Memorandum, bearing 
No.2374/SRC, dated 29.02.2008. Thereafter, father 
of the petitioner was asked to appear before the 
Medical Board through communications, dated 
17.03.2008, 14.04.2008, 15.05.2008 and 18.06.2008, 
but he did not bother to appear before the Medical 
Board rather he filed application, on 05.05.2008, for 
his retirement, w.e.f. 01.07.2008, on completion of 
qualifying service as a result, Notification, dated

of the petitioner, hence, the retirement of father of the 
petitioner cannot be considered on medical grounds.  
8. 
According to learned counsel for the 
petitioner, Medial Board was constituted pursuant to 
the application filed by the petitioner. Firstly, the 
question as to how petitioner could file application 
on behalf of his father, during his lifetime, especially 
when he was in service and secondly, the said 
application became irrelevant when his father himself 
filed application (imaged below) for his retirement on 
completion of qualifying service of 25 years.

Though, learned counsel for the petitioner challenged 
genuineness of the afore-imaged application but has 
not been able to convince this Court as to how his 
oral assertion can be preferred over a written 
document which was duly diarized against Serial 
No.5000, dated 08.05.2008 and was forwarded to the 
relevant quarter. It is well established by now that a 
written document outweighs an oral assertion. 
Moreover, during arguments learned counsel for the 
petitioner has categorically argued that since the 
aforesaid application does not bear the signatures of 
father of the petitioner same cannot be used against 
the petitioner but a perusal of the application shows 
that the same was not only signed by father of the 
petitioner but it also bears his thumb mark. 
9. 
While addressing the Court, learned counsel 
for the petitioner has referred to certain entries in 
Service Book of father of the petitioner to establish 
that retirement of father of the petitioner was on 
medical grounds but the said fact cannot be 
considered as conclusive proof especially when the 
same is considered while putting in it juxtaposition to 
the Pension Payment Order (imaged below) issued in 
favour of father of the petitioner: -

According to afore-imaged Pension Payment Order, 
class of pension has been mentioned as “Retiring”, 
thus, same could not be read as that on medical 
grounds. 
10. 
During arguments, learned counsel for the 
petitioner put much emphasis on the fact that since 
father of the petitioner has been held entitled for 
medical allowance, in addition to his monthly 
pension, his retirement was to be treated on medical 
grounds. In this regard, I do not agree with learned 
counsel for the petitioner for the reason that mere 
grant of medical allowance to a retiree does not 
determine the nature of his retirement rather contents

11. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner has 
repeatedly argued that since Invalidation Certificate 
in favour of father of the petitioner was duly issued 
by the Medical Board and verified by the Director 
General, Directorate General of Health Services, 
Punjab, the same was valid one but despite repeated 
queries he has not been able to satisfy this Court that 
when no record relating to its countersigning is 
available as to how any sanctity can be attached to 
the said document.  
12. 
It is very painful to note that learned Law 
Officer, while addressing the Court, has referred to 
dozens of documents which neither have been 
appended by the petitioner with this petition nor have 
been referred therein which means that the petitioner 
is guilty of concealment of material facts. It is well 
settled by now that a person who seeks equity must 
do equity and when anybody is found involved in 
active concealment of a fact germane for decision of 
a case, no relief can be granted to him rather he 
deserves imposition of exemplary costs. Reliance in
