 Through this Intra Court Appeal, filed under 
Section 3 of the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972, the 
appellant has called in question order dated 22.02.2023 
passed by learned Single Judge of this Court, whereby 
constitutional petition (WP No.12119 of 2023) filed by 
the appellant has been dismissed.  
2. 
It is contended by learned counsel for the appellant 
that the learned Single Judge did not appreciate that in 
similar matters, appeals in service matter against orders 
passed by the different Banks had been entertained by the 
State Bank of Pakistan and relief was granted to the 
employees relating to their reinstatement in service and 
the appellant has been discriminated against by order 
passed by State Bank of Pakistan dated 09.01.2023 
declining to interfere in the orders passed by respondent 
No.2/bank due to lack of jurisdiction.           
3. 
In her constitutional petition, the appellant has 
prayed as under: 
“In view of the above, it is, therefore, most 
respectfully prayed that a writ may kindly be 
issued in favor of the petitioner and against 
respondent No.1 while setting aside the impugned 

2 
ICA No.  18654 of 2023    
Dated:20.03.2023. 
order dated 09.01.2023 and directing respondent 
No.1 to decide the representation of the petitioner 
at the par with Liaqat Ali case for the sake of 
justice and equity.”  
 
4. 
The order dated 09.01.2023 passed by State Bank 
of Pakistan, challenged through the constitutional 
petition, is reproduced below: 
“1. This representation has been heard by the 
State Bank of Pakistan (hereinafter referred to as 
Respondent No. 1) in compliance with the 
directions issued by the Hon'ble Lahore High 
Court, Lahore passed vide Order dated 17.11.2022 
in ICA NO. 72454 of 2022 titled 'Mst. Asma Abdul 
Waris vs State Bank of Pakistan, etc'. 
 
2. The Petitioner, Ms. Asma Abdul Waris, claims 
that she joined United Bank Limited (hereinafter 
referred to as Respondent No. 2) as Assistant Vice 
President/Branch Manager on 01.04.2017. She 
was promoted as Vice President in March 2022 
but her promotion was withheld due to an ongoing 
inquiry for opening of fake bank accounts. An 
inquiry dated 13.05.2022 was conducted against 
her and she was unlawfully terminated from 
service by the Respondent No. 2. The Petitioner 
alleged that she also made representations to 
Respondent No. 1 to exercise its powers for her 
reinstatement, however, Respondent No. 1 did not 
exercise its powers. 
 
3. It is pertinent to mention that the State Bank of 
Pakistan does not intervene in HR matters of 
employees of banks as held by the Hon'ble courts 
in case of Noor Badshah VS United Bank limited 
and others (2015 PLC (C.S.) 468 Lahore High 
Court, Lahore) and MCB Bank Limited VS State 
Bank of Pakistan and others (2010 CLD 338 
Lahore High Court, Lahore). 
 
4. Nevertheless, in compliance with the Order 
dated 17.11.2022 issued by the Hon'ble Lahore 
High Court, the matter was fixed for hearing on 
30.12.2022 at SBP Banking Services Corporation 
office Faisalabad which was attended by the 
Petitioner and the representative of Respondent 
No. 2. During hearing the Petitioner and 

3 
ICA No.  18654 of 2023    
Dated:20.03.2023. 
Respondent No. 2, explained the issue However, 
the Petitioner was informed of the aforementioned 
legal limitations of the State Bank of Pakistan. 
Further, it was also communicated to the 
Petitioner that as per available records, no 
application/email is pending with Respondent 
No.1. 
 
5. In view of foregoing, the subject petition stands 
dispose of.” 
 
5. 
In the aforesaid order, it has specifically been 
mentioned that State Bank of Pakistan does not intervene 
in HR matters of employees of Banks as it has no 
jurisdiction to entertain the same in view of the principles 
laid down by Lahore High Court in the judgments 
reported as Noor Badshah vs. United Bank Limited and 
others (2015 PLC (C.S.) 468 and MCB Bank Limited vs. 
State Bank of Pakistan and others (2010 CLD 338). The 
operative part of judgment of Noor Badhshah’s case, in 
which case of MCB Limited has also been referred, is 
reproduced below:- 
“……… 
12.  In order to answer this question, it is 
necessary to determine whether the State Bank of 
Pakistan (SBP) has failed to perform any of its 
statutory 
and 
legal 
obligations 
regarding 
petitioners service disputes i.e. increments and 
recalculation of their pensionary benefits. As 
regards the authority and the role of SBP is 
concerned, SBP is only a regulatory authority for 
all the Banks operating in Pakistan and its 
functions are contemplated under the Banking 
Companies Ordinance, 1962 (Ordinance 1962) 
with respect to the activation and operation of 
banks and for carrying out purpose of Banking 
Companies Ordinance, 1962 and matters ancillary 
thereto. Perusal of various provision of Banking 
Company Ordinance, 1962 shows that the dispute 
between the petitioners and respondent Bank is not 
covered under the provision of Ordinance, 1962 
and that such regulatory role and control of SBP 
shall not clothe the Bank with the status of 

4 
ICA No.  18654 of 2023    
Dated:20.03.2023. 
"person" or "authority" performing function in 
connection with affairs of Federation. Learned 
counsel for the petitioner has not referred any 
statutory provision under which the State of Bank 
being a regulator have a statutory duty and 
obligation to direct the Bank to perform its 
functions in respect of its employees term and 
condition of service. In similar situation, while 
dealing with question of maintainability of writ 
petition against Muslim Commercial Bank, in case 
UIMCB Ltd. through Authorized representative v. 
State Bank of Pakistan through Governor and 2 
others (2010 CLD 338), it was held as under:--- 
"Analyzing the question with reference to 
section 41 of the Ordinance, it may be held 
that the State Bank has the power to give 
direction to the banks, if it is in the public 
interest and /or to prevent the affairs of any 
banking company being conducted in a 
manner detrimental to the interests of the 
depositors or in a manner prejudicial to the 
interest of the banking company, or to 
secure, the proper management of any 
banking company generally (underlined to 
supply emphasis). This power of the State 
Bank 
of 
Pakistan 
is 
not 
unlimited 
omnipotent, 
unbridled 
rather 
is 
circumscribed by the condition of being in 
the public interest, though public interest 
cannot always be constructed to mean all 
the people or most of the people, but 
obviously 
so 
many 
of 
them 
as 
contradistinguishes them from the few. Only 
for the reason that a few ex-employees of the 
MCB have formed a registered body would 
not mean to confer the petitioner with the 
status of the public whose interest should be 
served in terms of section 41(a); moreover, 
any impugned action or inaction on part of 
the MCB, does not fall within the concept of 
preventing the affairs of the banking 
company being conducted detrimental to the 
interest of the depositors, or prejudicial to 
the interest of the banking company, or for 
securing the proper management thereof, 
which again is the prerequisite for the 
exercise of the power of the State Bank of 
Pakistan on account of section 41(b)(c). The 
issue raised by the petitioner in this case 

5 
ICA No.  18654 of 2023    
Dated:20.03.2023. 
examined from any provision. Subsection (2) 
of section 41 of the Ordinance, also does not 
come to rescuer the petitioner as the 
directions, 
guidelines 
and 
instructions 
contemplated by this subsection are with 
respect to the activities and operations of 
the banks and the institutions for carrying 
out the purposes of the Ordinance and the 
matters ancillary thereto. The learned 
counsel for the petitioner has not been able 
to substantiate, if the grievance voiced in the 
petition is covered by section 41(2) of the 
Ordinance, therefore, I am quite clear in my 
view that no direction in the constitutional 
jurisdiction can be issued to the State Bank 
of Pakistan for further directing the MCB to 
perform any of the acts as are mentioned in 
the section." 
 
The august Supreme Court is Abdul Wahab's case 
supra also held as under:--- 
"As regards the authority and the role of the 
SBP (in the above context), SBP is only a 
regulatory body for all the banks operating 
in Pakistan in terms of Banking Companies 
Ordinance, 1962 and suffice it to say that 
such regulatory role and control of SBP 
shall not clothe the Bank, with the status of a 
person or the authority performing the 
functions in connection with the affairs of 
the Federation. Rather it shall remain to be 
a private entity". 
In view of above discussion, the SBP having not 
failed to perform any of its statutory obligation 
towards petitioner is not a necessary party in this 
petition and no direction can be issued to SBP for 
release 
of 
increments 
or 
recalculation 
of 
pensionary benefits of the petitioners.” 
 
6. 
The perusal of the afore referred judgment shows 
that the State Bank of Pakistan although supervises 
functioning of other banks yet it has got no jurisdiction in 
the service matters (HR matters) of employees of the said 
banks, however, the appellant seeks direction to State 
Bank of Pakistan to decide her representation as it is 

6 
ICA No.  18654 of 2023    
Dated:20.03.2023. 
claimed by learned counsel for the appellant that some 
orders were passed in the case of similarly placed 
persons, 
wherein 
appeals/representations 
were 
entertained by State Bank and decided.  Refers to order 
dated 04.07.2017 passed in the case of “Liaqat Ali vs. 
UBL” and order dated 21.08.2017 passed in the case of 
“Ijaz Hussain vs. UBL” relating to the same bank, 
however, it is noted that in the said orders question of 
jurisdiction of the State Bank of Pakistan to entertain 
appeals in service matters of employees of banks had not 
arisen and had not been decided, whereas in the present 
case, the State Bank has specifically raised the question 
relating to maintainability of appeal by relying upon the 
afore referred judgments of this Court, therefore, 
question of discrimination does not arise.  
7. 
It is contended by learned counsel for the appellant 
that State Bank had jurisdiction to entertain appeal in 
terms of Section 11 of the Banking Companies 
Ordinance, 1962 (“Ordinance”), which is reproduced 
below: 
“11.       Prohibition of employment of managing 
agents and restrictions on certain forms of 
employment.--- (1) No banking company,--- 
(a)     shall employ or be managed by a managing 
agent; or 
(b)     shall employ or continue the employment of 
any person— 
(i)      who is, or at any time has been, 
adjudicated insolvent or has suspended 
payment, or has compounded with his 
creditors, or who is, or has been, convicted 
by a criminal court of an offence involving 
moral turpitude; or 
(ii)     whose remuneration or part of whose 
remuneration takes the form of commission 
or a share in the profits of the company: 
Provided that nothing contained in sub-clause (ii) 
shall apply to the payment by a banking company 
of— 

7 
ICA No.  18654 of 2023    
Dated:20.03.2023. 
(a)     any bonus in pursuance of a settlement or 
award arrived at or made under any law relating 
to industrial disputes or in accordance with any 
scheme framed by such banking company or in 
accordance with the usual-practice prevailing in 
banking business; or 
(b)     any commission to any broker (including 
guarantee broker), cashier-contractor, clearing 
and forwarding agent, auctioneer or any other 
person, employed by the banking company under a 
contract otherwise than as a regular member of 
the staff of the company; or 
(c)     shall be managed by any person,--- 
(i)      who is a director of any other 
company not being a subsidiary company of 
the banking company or a company 
registered 
under 
section 
26 
of 
the 
Companies Act, 1913 (VII of 1913), except 
with the previous approval of the State 
Bank; or 
(ii)     who is engaged in any other business 
or vocation; or 
(iii)    who has a contract with the company 
for its management for a period exceeding 
five years at any one time: 
Provide that any contract with the company for its 
management may be renewed or extended for a 
further period not exceeding five years at a time if 
and so often as the directors so decide: 
Provided further that nothing in this clause shall 
apply to a director, other than the managing 
director, of a banking company by reason only of 
his being such director. 
(2)      Where a person holding the office of a 
chairman or director or manager or chief 
executive officer (by whatever name called) of a 
banking company is, or has been found any 
tribunal or other authority (other than a criminal 
court) to have contravened the by provision of any 
law and the State Bank is satisfied that the 
contravention is of such a nature that the 
association of such person with the banking 
company is or will be detrimental to the interest of 
the banking company or its depositors or 
otherwise undesirable, the State Bank may make 
an order that person shall cease to hold the office 
with effect from such date as may be specified 
therein and thereupon, that office shall, with effect 
from the said date, become vacant. 

8 
ICA No.  18654 of 2023    
Dated:20.03.2023. 
(3)      Any order made under sub-section (2) in 
respect of any person may also provide that he 
shall not, without the pervious permission of the 
State Bank in writing, in any way, directly or 
indirectly, be concerned with, or take part in the 
management of the banking company or any other 
banking company for such period not exceeding 
five years as may be specified in the order. 
(4)      No order under sub-section (2) shall be 
made in respect of any person unless he has been 
given an opportunity of making a representation to 
the State Bank against the proposed order: 
Provided that it shall not be necessary to give any 
such opportunity if, in the opinion of the State 
Bank, any delay would be detrimental to the 
interests of the banking company or its depositors. 
(5)      Any decision or order of the State Bank 
made under this section shall be final for all 
purposes.” 
 
Suffice it to say that aforesaid Section deals with 
prohibition of employment of managing agents and 
restrictions on certain forms of employment and does not 
relate to the service matters of other employees of banks 
or their cases about terms and conditions of service and 
termination, consequently the reliance of the counsel for 
appellant on the said Section is misplaced.  Moreover, in  
Noor Badshah case (supra) it has also been held that 
power of State Bank to give directions provided in 
Section 41 of the Ordinance is not applicable to service 
matters of bank employees.  The learned Single Judge 
considered the said aspect of the matter in the impugned 
order relating to application of Section 11 of the 
Ordinance while dismissing the constitutional petition of 
the appellant, relevant portion of which is reproduced 
below: 
“Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that 
since the inquiry against the petitioner was 
conducted pursuant to a complaint filed before 
State Bank of Pakistan, the fate of her termination 

9 
ICA No.  18654 of 2023    
Dated:20.03.2023. 
was also to be decided by the State Bank of 
Pakistan. Adds that the petitioner has been made 
to suffer for the mis- deeds of the others. Further 
adds that according to Section 11 of the Banking 
Companies Ordinance, 1962, the said bank has 
authority to regulate the matters relating to the 
employment of managing agents and restrictions 
on certain forms of employment, hence the 
impugned order is not sustainable. 
3. After hearing learned counsel for the parties 
and going through the documents appended with 
this petition, I have noted that admittedly the 
petitioner was an employee of the United Bank 
Limited and she was terminated from service while 
serving as Manager, meaning thereby she was not 
the employee of the State Bank of Pakistan, hence 
it had no jurisdiction to deal with the matter 
relating to the terms and conditions of service of 
the petitioner. 
4. Now coming to the plea of the petitioner that in 
terms of section 11, ibid, the State Bank of 
Pakistan was to decide the fate of representation of 
the petitioner, I am of the view that the said 
provision does not empower the State Bank of 
Pakistan to deal with any matter relating to terms 
and conditions of service of an employee of a 
private bank, hence the said provision does not 
come to the rescue of the petitioner. 
5. Insofar as the contention of learned counsel for 
the petitioner that since action was taken against 
the petitioner pursuant to a complaint filed before 
the State Bank of Pakistan is concerned, suffice it 
to note that any person can file complaint before 
the State Bank of Pakistan complaining mal- 
administration on the part of a banking company 
but the said fact does not empower the State Bank 
of Pakistan to deal with any matter relating to 
terms and conditions of service of an employee of 
a private bank. 
6. For what has been discussed above, I see no 
force in this petition, which is accordingly 
dismissed in limine.” 
 
8.  
The learned Single Judge rightly concluded that 
the State Bank of Pakistan had no jurisdiction to hear and 
decide service matters of employees of Banks such as the 
appellant’s case and where a jurisdiction is not vested by 

10 
ICA No.  18654 of 2023    
Dated:20.03.2023. 
law, the courts would not ordinarily confer said 
jurisdiction on any authority for the reason that 
jurisdiction could not be conferred by parties even by 
consent.  Reliance in this regard may be placed upon the 
judgments reported as 2022 SCMR 2044 (EDEN 
BUILDERS (PVT.) LIMITED, LAHORE versus 
MUHAMMAD ASLAM and others) and PLD 2008 
Lahore 175 (Water And Power Development Authority 
through Chairman, WAPDA and 4 others versus Abdul 
Shakoor through Legal Heirs). Besides it is settled by 
now that where a thing is required to be done in a 
particular manner, it must be done in the said manner and 
not otherwise as the same would be against the intention 
of legislature and not sustainable. Reliance in this behalf 
may be placed on 2022 SCMR 2080 (Mall Development 
(Pvt.) Ltd. versus Waleed Khanzada and others), 
wherein it is mentioned that when the law provides a 
particular manner of doing things, they must be done in 
that manner or not at all. Anything done to the contrary 
would be illegal, ex-facie erroneous and unsustainable in 
law. Same principle has been laid down in judgments 
reported as 2021 SCMR 1979 (Attaullah Khan versus 
Ali Azam Afridi and others), PLD 2018 SC 189 
(Muhammad Hanif Abbasi versus Imran Khan Niazi), 
2017 SCMR 1427 (The Collector of Sales Tax, 
Gujranwala versus Super Asia Mohammad Din and 
Sons), 2016 CLD 2025 (SC) = PLD 2016 SC 995 
(Shahida Bibi and others versus Habib Bank Limited 
and others), PLD 2013 SC 255 (Muhammad Anwar and 
others versus Mst. Ilyas Begum and others), 2014 
SCMR 1015 (Zia Ur Rehman versus Syed Ahmed 
Hussain and others), PLD 2011 SC 512 (Khalil-ur-
Rehman and another versus Dr. Manzoor Ahmed and 

11 
ICA No.  18654 of 2023    
Dated:20.03.2023. 
others) and 2007 SCMR 1086 (Muhammad Akram 
versus Mst. Zainab Bibi). 
9. 
In view of what has been discussed above, the 
impugned order passed by learned Single Judge is in 
consonance with the judgments earlier passed by this 
Court as well as law on the subject and no illegality, 
jurisdictional defect or mis-reading of record has been 
pointed out in the said well-reasoned order for us to 
warrant any interfere in the same.   
 
10. 
For what has been discussed above, this appeal 
being devoid of any merit is dismissed.
