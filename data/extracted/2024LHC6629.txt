Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – Through this application, the 
petitioner seeks post-arrest bail in case FIR No.348/2023 dated 
01.11.2023 registered at Police Station Raitra, District Dera Ghazi Khan, 
for an offence under section 376(3) of the Pakistan Penal Code 1860 
(PPC). Earlier, he applied to the Juvenile Court for the same relief which 
was refused.  
2. 
 
Briefly, the allegation against the petitioner is that on 
1.11.2023 at about 3:00 p.m., he committed an unnatural offence with the 
complainant‟s six-year-old son, M.I. 
3. 
 
Malik Muhammad Usman Bhatti, Advocate, contends that 
the petitioner is innocent and the complainant has falsely implicated him 
in this case due to previous enmity. He further asserts that the petitioner 
was a little over 11 years old at the time of the alleged occurrence and 
lacked maturity. Hence, his case falls within the statutory exception

mentioned in section 83 PPC2, and he is entitled to the relief of post-arrest 
bail, which he has prayed for. 
4. 
 
Mr. Adnan Latif Sheikh, Deputy Prosecutor General, has 
refuted the allegation of false implication. He contends that the petitioner 
is named in the FIR with a specific accusation. The victim and PWs 
Muhammad Nadeem and Manzoor Ahmad support the prosecution‟s case. 
Their statements have been recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C. which are 
corroborated by medical evidence. The Deputy Prosecutor General argues 
that section 83 PPC falls in Chapter IV of the PPC titled  
“General Exceptions”. If the petitioner seeks the benefit of that exception, 
he must establish that he had not attained sufficient maturity on the 
alleged date of occurrence. He has to discharge that onus even at the bail 
stage, which he has failed to do. The Deputy Prosecutor General 
maintains that the petitioner has committed a heinous offence and is not 
entitled to bail. 
5. 
 
The complainant‟s counsel has adopted the Deputy 
Prosecutor General‟s arguments. 
6. 
 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
7. 
 
The petitioner is specifically accused of committing an 
unnatural offence with six-year-old M.I. on 01.11.2023 around 03:00 p.m. 
The victim, M.I., and PWs Muhammad Nadeem and Manzoor Ahmad 
support the prosecution‟s case, and medical evidence further corroborates 
them. M.I‟s medico-legal certificate indicates penetration. During the 
investigation, the Medical Officer examined the petitioner and confirmed 
that he was sexually mature. On a tentative assessment of the available 
evidence, there is sufficient incriminating material against the petitioner. 
8. 
 
Since the petitioner was around 11 years old at the time of 
the alleged occurrence, Mr. Bhatti asserts that he lacks the maturity to 
understand the nature and consequences of his acts and claims that he is 
                                                   
2 Section 83 PPC reads as follows: 
83. 
Act of a child above ten and under fourteen of immature understanding. – Nothing is offence 
which is done by a child above ten years of age and under fourteen, who has not attained sufficient maturity of 
understanding to judge the nature and consequences of his conduct on that occasion.

immune from prosecution under section 83 PPC. It is necessary to 
examine the specifics of this provision to appreciate the contention.  
9. 
 
Chapter IV (sections 76 to 106) of the PPC, captioned 
“General Exceptions”, provides a comprehensive framework of defences 
and justifications that can exonerate individuals from criminal liability 
under specific conditions. These exceptions play a crucial role in the legal 
system by recognizing that some unlawful acts, although typically 
considered offences, are not punishable under certain circumstances. 
10. 
 
Section 82 PPC states that nothing is an offence done by a 
child under ten. The legislature considers him incapable of committing an 
offence and thus provides him with absolute immunity from criminal 
prosecution. Section 83 PPC extends this protection to children aged 
between ten and fourteen years but with a significant difference: the 
exemption applies only if the child has not attained sufficient maturity to 
understand the nature and consequences of his conduct. This conditional 
immunity acknowledges that while children in this age group are 
developing, they may still lack the full capacity to discern right from 
wrong. Sections 82 and 83 PPC collectively represent a nuanced 
perspective on juvenile justice, balancing the need for accountability with 
the recognition of children‟s developmental phases. 
11. 
 
Parliament has enacted the Juvenile Justice System Act 2018 
(JJSA) to address young offenders‟ unique vulnerabilities and 
rehabilitative requirements. It focuses on the disposal of their cases 
through diversion and social integration for rehabilitation.3 Section 83 
PPC and the JJSA complement each other, providing a coherent 
framework that safeguards children‟s rights and contributes to the broader 
societal goal of reducing recidivism through rehabilitative and restorative 
justice measures.  
12. 
 
A fundamental principle of criminal law is that the accused is 
presumed innocent until proven guilty. Consequently, the burden is on the 
prosecution to prove the accused‟s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. 
However, if he claims an exception under Chapter IV of the PPC or other

special laws, Article 121 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat 1984 (QSO) requires 
him to prove the existence of such circumstances which bring the case 
within that exception. The court “shall presume” the absence of such 
circumstances.  
13. 
 
Sub-Articles (7), (8), and (9) of Article 2 explains the phrases 
“may presume,” “shall presume,” and “conclusive proof”. The term  
“may presume” indicates that it is within the court‟s discretion to either 
draw the referenced presumption outlined in the law or choose not to. The 
words “shall presume” mandate the court to draw a presumption as 
specified unless the fact is disproved, establishing a rule of rebuttable 
presumption. “Conclusive proof” refers to cases where the law determines 
that any amount of other evidence will not alter the conclusion reached 
when the basic facts are admitted or proved. In M/s Sodhi Transport Co. 
and another v. State of U.P. and another (AIR 1986 SC 1099), the 
Supreme Court of India stated: 
“A presumption is not in itself evidence but only makes a prima facie 
case for the party in whose favour it exists. It is a rule concerning 
evidence. It indicates the person on whom the burden of proof lies. 
When the presumption is conclusive, it obviates the production of any 
other evidence to dislodge the conclusion to be drawn on proof of 
certain facts. But when it is rebuttable, it only points out the party on 
whom lies the duty of going forward with evidence on the fact 
presumed, and when that party has produced evidence fairly and 
reasonably tending to show that the real fact is not as presumed, the 
purpose of presumption is over. Then, the evidence will determine the 
true nature of the facts to be established. The rules of presumption are 
deduced from enlightened human knowledge and experience and are 
drawn from the connection, relation and coincidence of facts and 
circumstances.” 
14. 
 
When the burden of proof is upon the accused, they must 
present sufficient evidence, which can be oral, documentary, or any other 
form. However, unlike the prosecution, which must prove the charge 
“beyond a reasonable doubt”, the accused is not required to meet this 
stringent standard to succeed in their defence. Instead, they only need to 
establish their defence based on the civil standard of proof, which is the 
“balance of probabilities”.4 If this evidence raises reasonable doubt about 
any element of the offence, the judge must acquit the accused, as the 
prosecution will have failed to establish guilt conclusively. The Supreme

Court of India articulated this legal principle as follows in Vijayee Singh 
and Others v. State of Uttar Pradesh (AIR 1990 SC 1459): 
“The general burden of establishing the guilt of accused is always on 
the prosecution, and it never shifts. Even in respect of the cases covered 
by section 105 [of the Indian Evidence Act]5, the prosecution is not 
absolved of its duty of discharging the burden. The accused may raise a 
plea of exception either by pleading the same specifically or by relying 
on the probabilities and circumstances obtaining in the case. He may 
adduce the evidence in support of his plea directly or rely on the 
prosecution case itself or, as stated above, he can indirectly introduce 
such circumstances by way of cross-examination and also rely on the 
probabilities and the other circumstances. Then, the initial presumption 
against the accused regarding the non-existence of the circumstances in 
favour of his plea gets displaced. On examining the material, if a 
reasonable doubt arises, the benefit of it should go to the accused. The 
accused can also discharge the burden under section 105 by a 
preponderance of probabilities in favour of his plea. In case of general 
exceptions, special exceptions, provisos contained in the Penal Code or 
any law defining the offence, the court, after due consideration of the 
evidence in the light of the above principles, if satisfied, would state, in 
the first instance, as to which exception the accused is entitled to, then 
see whether he would be entitled for a complete acquittal of the offence 
charged or would be liable for a lesser offence and convict him 
accordingly.” 
15. 
 
In Abdul Sattar and another (minors) v. The Crown 
(PLD 1949 Lahore 372), a case in which a defence under section 83 PPC 
was raised, the High Court, while deciding the appeal, ruled that the 
prosecution does not need to present positive evidence demonstrating that 
a child under 12 years6 has attained sufficient maturity of understanding 
under section 83 PPC. Instead, the child‟s maturity can be inferred from 
the circumstances of the case. The High Court further stated that 
exceptions must be specifically pleaded and established by evidence by 
the accused person. In Sheikh Hassan v. Bashir Ahmad and another 
[PLD 1966 (W.P.) Peshawar 97], it was held that “sufficient maturity of 
understanding” is to be presumed in the case of such a child unless the 
contrary is proven by the defence, i.e., the burden of proof lies on the 
accused, above the age of seven and below twelve,7 to show that he had 
not attained sufficient maturity. 
16. 
 
The “burden of proof” concept operates somewhat differently 
during an investigation than during a trial. Nevertheless, even at the 
                                                   
5 Section 105 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 parallels Article 121 of Pakistan‟s Qanun-e-Shahadat 1984. 
6 When this case was decided, section 83 PPC provided that nothing is an offence which is done by a child above seven 
years of age and under twelve. Section 83 was amended by Act X of 2016.

investigation stage, the accused is presumed innocent. During an 
investigation, the goal is to gather enough evidence to determine if there 
is a reasonable basis to charge someone with a crime. Investigators aim to 
establish probable cause or reasonable suspicion, but they are not required 
to meet the rigorous standards of a trial. In contrast, during a trial, the 
prosecution must prove the defendant‟s guilt “beyond a reasonable 
doubt”. This requires presenting compelling evidence to convince the 
judge or jury, while the defence aims to introduce reasonable doubt. In a 
nub, the burden of proof during an investigation focuses on justifying 
charges, whereas during a trial, it is about proving guilt to a high degree 
of certainty.  
17. 
 
Section 6 PPC stipulates that all definitions of offences, 
penal provisions, and illustrations in the Code must be interpreted subject 
to the exceptions contained in Chapter IV (captioned “General 
Exceptions”), even if they are not explicitly mentioned in each definition, 
provision, or illustration. Therefore, the police are obligated to take these 
exceptions into account during the investigation of a case. If any of them 
apply, the actions in question cannot be deemed as constituting an 
offence. In A.K. Chaudhary and others v. The State of Gujarat and 
others [2006 Cri.LJ 726 (Gujarat)], the Gujarat High Court ruled that 
when the police are assessing whether the accusations in a complaint 
indicate the commission of a cognizable offence, they must consider the 
General Exceptions outlined in Chapter IV of the Indian Penal Code 
(IPC).8 The Court stated that if the allegations in the complaint fall under 
these general exceptions, the actions cannot be deemed an offence. 
However, if the allegations do not clearly fall within them, the police 
should continue their investigation. The ruling emphasized that ignoring 
the General Exceptions during the investigation could lead to treating 
actions as offences that are actually exempt under the IPC, thereby 
nullifying their purpose. Rule 25.2(3) of the Police Rules, 1934, also 
embodies this principle. It states that it is an investigating officer‟s duty to 
discover the truth of the matter under investigation. His objective shall be 
to discover the actual facts of the case and arrest the real offender or

offenders. He must not prematurely commit to any view of the facts for or 
against anyone. 
18. 
 
It follows from the above discussion that if an accused raises 
a defence based on exceptions during the investigation, they are required, 
under Article 121 of the QSO, to provide evidence supporting their claim, 
meeting the civil standard of proof, which is the balance of probabilities. 
Investigative authorities are responsible for collecting all relevant 
evidence, including that presented by the accused, and then submitting a 
report under section 173 Cr.P.C. 
19. 
 
If the accused is a juvenile, the provisions of JJSA must be 
followed during the investigation and trial. Section 5(1)(b) of the JJSA 
mandates that when a juvenile is arrested, he shall be kept in an 
observation home. The officer in-charge of the police station shall, as 
soon as possible, inform the Probation Officer concerned to enable him to 
obtain such information about the juvenile and other circumstances which 
may be of assistance to the Juvenile Court. Section 7(2) ordains that the 
investigating officer, with the assistance of the Probation Officer or a 
social welfare officer, prepare a social investigation report to be annexed 
with the report under section 173 Cr.P.C.  
20. 
 
The principles regarding the burden of proof discussed in 
paragraph 18 also apply to cases where a juvenile accused is between the 
ages of ten and fourteen. Thus, the investigating officer must collect 
evidence to establish the child‟s maturity level. During the investigation, 
the prosecution does not need to present direct evidence demonstrating the 
child‟s maturity; it can be inferred from the circumstances of the case, as 
stated in Abdul Sattar, supra. If the defence claims the child lacked the 
requisite maturity, the burden shifts to them to provide supporting 
evidence. They must meet the civil standard of proof by showing, on a 
balance of probabilities, that the child did not understand the nature and 
consequences of their actions. This evidence could include psychological 
evaluations, testimonies about the child‟s behaviour, or other relevant 
documents. If this evidence suggests the child lacked the necessary 
maturity, it raises reasonable doubt about their criminal responsibility.

The onus shifts to the juvenile accused when preliminary evidence 
suggests sufficient maturity. 
21. 
 
The JJSA classifies offences into three categories: heinous, 
major, and minor. According to section 2(g) of the Act, “heinous offence” 
means an offence which is serious, gruesome, brutal, sensational in 
character or shocking to public morality and which is punishable under 
the PPC or any other law for the time being in force with death or 
imprisonment for life or imprisonment for more than seven years with or 
without fine. Section 2(m) states that “major offence” means an offence 
for which punishment under the PPC or any other law for the time being 
in force is more than three years and up to seven years imprisonment with 
or without a fine. Section 2(o) states that “minor offence” means an 
offence for which the maximum punishment under the PPC or any other 
law for the time being in force is imprisonment for up to three years with 
or without a fine. 
22. 
 
The classification of heinous, major, and minor offences in 
the JJSA is based on the severity of the prescribed punishment, not on 
moral or ethical considerations alone. Since rape, as defined under section 
375 PPC, carries a sentence of death or life imprisonment, it 
unequivocally meets the criteria for a heinous offence.  
23. 
 
Rape cannot be excluded from the definition of a  
“heinous offence” by merely categorizing it as an offence of moral 
turpitude. As adumbrated, the legal definition of heinous offences under 
the JJSA is strictly tied to the severity of the punishment. Attempting to 
reclassify rape as solely an offence of moral turpitude to exclude it from 
the category of heinous offences would not align with the statutory 
language and intent of the JJSA. Such reclassification could undermine 
the legal consistency and the intended gravity accorded to the crime of 
rape within the framework of juvenile justice.  
24. 
 
Section 5 of the JJSA stipulates the procedure to be followed 
when a juvenile is arrested. Section 6 of the Act provides for his release 
on bail during the pendency of the case against him. Section 6(1) of the 
JJSA states that a juvenile accused of a bailable offence shall be released 

Crl.Misc.No.1629/B/2024  
 
 
 
 
 
 
9 
 
by the Juvenile Court on bail unless it appears that there are reasonable 
grounds for believing that the release of such juvenile may bring him in 
association with criminals or expose him to any other danger. In this 
situation, the juvenile shall be placed under the custody of a suitable 
person or Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre under the supervision of a 
Probation Officer. The juvenile shall not under any circumstances be kept 
in a police station under police custody or jail in such cases. Section 6(3) 
of the Act provides for treating the 
“minor 
offences” and  
“major offences” as bailable. Section 6(4) provides that where a juvenile 
is more than sixteen years of age and is arrested or detained for a heinous 
offence, he may not be released on bail if the Juvenile Court is of the 
opinion that there are reasonable grounds to believe that such juvenile is 
involved in the commission of a heinous offence. Even in cases involving 
heinous offences under section 6(5), the juvenile must be released on bail 
if he is under detention for a continuous period exceeding six months, his 
trial is not completed and he is not responsible for the delay. The said 
period is to be counted from the date of the juvenile‟s arrest.9 
25. 
 
Where the age of the juvenile is around 11, and he is accused 
of a heinous offence, the case may not strictly fall under section 6(3) or 
section 6(4) of the JJSA. Section 6(3) deals with minor and major 
offences but does not mention the third category, i.e., heinous offences. 
On the other hand, section 6(4), although dealing with heinous offences, 
applies to situations where the juvenile is over sixteen years of age. The 
issue is of great significance. If the case is treated under section 6(3), he 
can claim bail as a matter of right even after committing a heinous 
offence, while in the case of section 6(4), although bail can be granted to 
him, the juvenile cannot claim such bail as a matter of right, as indicated 
by the use of the words “he may not be released on bail”. 
26. 
 
In the matter of Reference by the President of Pakistan 
under Article 162 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan 
[PLD 1957 SC (Pak) 219], Muhammad Munir CJ. stated: “Ever since man 
learnt to express his feelings and thoughts in words, the function of the 
person to whom the words are addressed, a function of which he is 
                                                   
9 Khawar Kiyani v. The State and others (PLD 2022 SC 551).

scarcely conscious, has been to understand what is intended to be 
conveyed by the speaker; and ever since the law began to be written the 
duty of those to whom it is addressed or who are called upon to expound 
it has been to discover the intention of the lawgiver.” His Lordship set out 
rules for construing statutes and the Constitution, emphasizing that the 
primary objective in interpreting any written instrument is to discover the 
author‟s intention. He inter alia stated that the legislature‟s intention in 
enacting a statute should be derived from considering the whole 
enactment to achieve a consistent plan. When a statute contains both 
specific and general provisions, the specific provisions should take 
precedence, while the general provisions should apply only to other 
relevant parts of the statute. Effect should be given to every part, and 
every word of the statute or Constitution, and courts should avoid 
interpretations that render any provision meaningless, favouring those that 
make every word operative. Courts must consider the entire document to 
determine the true intent and meaning of any specific provision. If 
different provisions appear contradictory, the court should strive to 
harmonize them. 
27. 
 
While analyzing the statute as aforesaid, the courts should 
first presume that the “legislature chooses its words carefully. Therefore, 
if a word or phrase has been added somewhere, such addition is not to be 
deemed redundant; conversely, if a word or phrase has been left out 
somewhere, such omission is not be deemed inconsequential.”10 
Secondly, courts should presume that the legislature does not intend 
“absurd” consequences to flow from the application of its Act. In this 
context, “absurd” means contrary to sense and reason. “The presumption 
leads to avoidance by the interpreter of six types of undesirable 
consequences: (i) an unworkable or impracticable result; (ii) an 
inconvenient result; (iii) an anomalous or illogical result; (iv) a futile or 
pointless result; (v) an artificial result; and (vi) a disproportionate counter-
mischief.”11

28. 
 
Let‟s now go back to the JJSA. I have already pointed out 
that the Act classifies offences into three categories based on their 
severity and the stipulated punishments – though the age of the offender is 
also a relevant factor in certain instances. The legislature intends to be 
lenient with the offender in minor and major offences and harsh in 
heinous offences. Therefore, it treats all minor and major offences as 
bailable, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Code 
of Criminal Procedure or other statute, as the case may be. The legislative 
intent is that the bail of juveniles accused of heinous offences should be 
considered on merits. In this respect, the following observations of the 
Supreme Court which it made in Khawar Kayani v. The State and others 
(PLD 2022 SC 551), are instructive: 
“Section 6(4) of the Act provides that where a juvenile is more than 
sixteen years of age and is arrested or detained for a heinous offence, 
he may not be released on bail if the Juvenile Court is of the opinion 
that there are reasonable grounds to believe that such juvenile is 
involved in the commission of a heinous offence. While section 6(4) 
deals with the bail of juveniles under a heinous offence on merits, a 
separate provision provides for bail to the same juveniles where they 
have been detained for a continuous period exceeding six months and 
whose trial has not been completed. Under the Act, only in a case 
involving “heinous offence” can a juvenile be detained in a police 
station or a jail. Thus, it can safely be concluded that section 6(5) of the 
Act does apply, rather solely applies, to a case involving a “heinous 
offence”, irrespective of the age of the juvenile. Section 6(5) in effect 
works as a proviso to section 6(4) and appears to have no other purpose 
under the scheme of the Act. The approach of the trial court, in the 
present case, to decline benefit of section 6(5) of the Act to the 
petitioner merely by observing that the offence is “heinous” is not 
legally correct; this subsection is meant for, and only applies to, a case 
involving “heinous offence”. To hold otherwise will render section 6(5) 
redundant and unnecessary.” 
(emphasis added) 
29. 
 
If the classification of the offences is based on the age of the 
offender, the JJSA‟s scheme would be disturbed. It would reduce the 
offences to two categories: (a) offences, whether minor, major or heinous, 
committed by an offender up to sixteen years, and (b) the offences of a 
heinous nature committed by an offender above the said threshold of 
sixteen years.  
30. 
 
In conclusion, the JJSA does not inherently exhibit leniency 
towards heinous offences. The legislative intent is that the bail decisions 
for juveniles accused of such offences should be based on the merits of 

Crl.Misc.No.1629/B/2024  
 
 
 
 
 
 
12 
 
each case. This approach allows the court to consider factors such as the 
nature of the offence, the juvenile‟s age, circumstances, and the potential 
threat to public safety before granting or denying bail. This nuanced 
treatment underscores a balanced approach – promoting rehabilitation for 
less severe offences while ensuring public safety and accountability for 
more serious crimes. 
31. 
 
Section 23 of the JJSA provides that the provisions of this 
Act shall have overriding effect notwithstanding anything contained in 
any other law for the time being in force. This means that if there are any 
inconsistencies or contradictions between the JJSA and other existing 
laws, the regulations specified within the JJSA will supersede and take 
precedence. If the JJSA does not explicitly address a particular matter, the 
general law, i.e. the Code of Criminal Procedure, would apply. Section 
5(2) Cr.P.C. also supports this view. It provides that all offences under 
any law other than the PPC shall be investigated, inquired into, tried, and 
otherwise dealt with according to the provisions of the Code, but subject 
to any enactment for the time being in force regulating the manner or 
place of investigating, inquiring into, trying or otherwise dealing with 
such offence. 
32. 
 
Section 497 Cr.P.C. specifies the conditions under which bail 
may be granted in non-bailable cases. Sub-section (1) of this provision 
states that when any person accused of a non-bailable offence is arrested 
or detained without a warrant by an officer in charge of a police station or 
appears or is brought before a court, he may be released on bail, but he 
shall not be so released if there appear reasonable grounds for believing 
that he has been guilty of an offence punishable with death or 
imprisonment for life or imprisonment for ten years. However, the first 
proviso to section 497 states: 
Provided that the Court may direct that any person under the age of 
sixteen years or any woman or any sick or infirm person accused of 
such an offence be released on bail.

The Supreme Court considered the first proviso to section

Cr.P.C. 
in 
Tahira 
Batool 
v. 
The 
State 
and 
another  
(PLD 2022 SC 764) and held that in cases of an accused under sixteen

years, a woman or any sick or infirm person, irrespective of the category 
of offence, the bail is to be granted as a rule and refused as an exception. 
The relevant excerpt is reproduced below: 
“However, the first proviso to section 497(1) Cr.P.C. provides that the 
court may direct that any person under the age of sixteen years or any 
woman or any sick or infirm person accused of such an offence be 
released on bail. The expression „such an offence‟ used in this proviso 
refers to the offence mentioned in the second part (prohibitory clause) 
of section 497(1) Cr.P.C., as for all other non-bailable offences the 
court is already empowered to release the accused on bail under the 
first part of section 497(1) Cr.P.C. The first proviso has thus made 
equal the power of the court to grant bail in the offences of prohibitory 
clause alleged against an accused under the age of sixteen years, a 
woman accused and a sick or infirm accused, to its power under the 
first part of section 497(1) Cr.P.C. This means that in cases of women, 
etc., as mentioned in the first proviso to section 497(1), irrespective of 
the category of the offence, bail is to be granted as a rule and refused as 
an exception12 in the same manner as it is granted or refused in offences 
that do not fall within the prohibitory clause of section 497(1) Cr.P.C.” 
 
 
The above view was reaffirmed in Mst. Ghazala v. The State 
and another (2023 SCMR 887). 
34. 
 
It is neither possible nor advisable to enumerate all the 
“extraordinary and exceptional circumstances” that Tahira Batool and 
Mst. Ghazala contemplated. However, the case of Tariq Bashir and 
others v. The State (PLD 1995 SC 34) provides some examples. These 
are: (a) where there is a likelihood of the accused absconding; (b) where 
there is apprehension that the accused will tamper with the prosecution 
evidence; (c) where there is a danger of the offence being repeated if the 
accused is released on bail; and (d) where the accused is a previous 
convict.

In the present case, the petitioner was around eleven at the 
time of the alleged occurrence. According to the FIR, he was found 
committing sodomy with M.I. while grazing goats in the fields. The 
investigating officer has not investigated the circumstances preceding the 
incident which were necessary to establish mens rea. He has also not 
obtained the reports under sections 5(1)(b) and 7(2) of the JJSA, although 
they were mandatory. Given that the petitioner‟s age is closer to the lower 
end of the 10 to 14 age bracket, more convincing evidence is required to

State (2021 SCMR 2084).

establish his maturity level, even at the investigation stage. This is 
because younger children are generally presumed to lack the maturity to 
understand the nature and consequences of their actions thoroughly. If a 
child is closer to 14 years old, the presumption might lean more towards 
the likelihood of sufficient maturity, thus requiring comparatively less 
rigorous evidence to establish this maturity. For all these reasons, further 
inquiry is needed to determine the petitioner‟s guilt. In Resham Khan and 
another v. The State and another (2021 SCMR 2011), the Supreme 
Court held: 
“ … further inquiry is a question which must have some nexus with the 
result of the case for which a tentative assessment of the material on 
record is to be considered for reaching just conclusion. The case of 
further inquiry pre-supposes the tentative assessment which may create 
doubt with respect to the involvement of accused in the crime. It is well 
settled that object of trial is to make an accused to face the trial and not 
to punish an under-trial prisoner. The basic idea is to enable the 
accused to answer criminal prosecution against him rather than to rot 
him behind the bar. Every accused is innocent until his guilt is proved, 
and the benefit of doubt can be extended to the accused even at bail 
stage if the facts of the case so warrant. The basic philosophy of 
criminal jurisprudence is that the prosecution has to prove its case 
beyond reasonable doubt and this principle applies at all stages 
including pre-trial and even at the time of deciding whether accused is 
entitled to bail or not.” 
36. 
 
In addition to the need for further investigation to determine 
the petitioner‟s guilt, the case also falls under the first proviso of Section 
497(1) Cr.P.C. According to the Supreme Court‟s ruling in Tahira Batool 
and Mst. Ghazala, granting bail to a juvenile of his age is the norm, while 
refusal is the exception. There are no exceptional circumstances in the 
present case for which bail may be withheld. Therefore, this application is 
allowed. The petitioner is admitted to post-arrest bail subject to his 
furnishing bail bond of Rs.200,000/- (Rupees two hundred thousand) with 
two sureties in the like amount to the trial court‟s satisfaction.
