Ch. Muhammad Iqbal, J:-  Through this civil revision 
the petitioners have challenged the validity of the judgment & 
decree dated 06.12.2012 passed by the learned Civil Judge, 
Attock who decreed the suit for possession through pre-emption 
filed by the respondent No.1 and also assailed the judgment & 
decree dated 16.03.2016 passed by the learned Additional District 
Judge, Attock who dismissed the appeal of petitioners. 
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that Muhammad Ahsan, 
respondent No.1/plaintiff filed a suit for possession through pre-
emption against Safdar Khan etc/petitioners/defendants in respect 
of land measuring 03 Kanal 08 Marla fully described in the 
headnote 
of 
the 
plaint 
and 
contended 
that 
the 
petitioners/defendants purchased the suit land from Aslam son of 
Ghulam Sarwar through mutation No.1282 dated 16.04.2008. On 
23.04.2008 at about 12:00 noon when the respondent/plaintiff 
was present on his shop situated at Malik Market, Hazro Road 
Gondal and Muhammad Iqbal s/o Fazal Dad as well as Mansoor 
Abbas s/o Malik Akhtar r/o Awan Abad were present there. At 
Date of hearing  
27.09.2023

that time Muhammad Asif came there and informed him about 
the sale mutation and the respondent/plaintiff promptly 
announced to pre-empt the said sale. That on 24.04.2008 the 
respondent/ plaintiff sent notice of Talb-i-Ishhad and thereafter 
instituted suit on 07.05.2008. The petitioners/defendants sold 
back the suit property to Muhammad Aslam, ex-owner of the suit 
land through mutation No.1290 entered on 29.04.2008 and 
sanctioned on 07.05.2008 and mutation Nos.1402 & 1403 dated 
20.06.2008. The petitioners/ defendants filed contested written 
statement and contended that the land subject matter of sale 
mutation No.1403 dated 20.06.2009 is although a different 
property against which the plaintiff‟s suit was not pending. 
That the preempted sale mutation has been rescinded as the 
vendee returned/resold the land to the vendor and cause of 
action stood extinguished, thus the suit is not maintainable. As 
per divergent pleading of the parties, the trial Court framed 
issues as under:- 
1. Whether the plaintiff has got preferential right of pre-
emption qua the defendant No.1 to 4? OPP 
2. Whether the plaintiff has performed the required 
Talabs as per law? OPP 
3. Whether the price of suit property value Rs.3,50,000/- 
is ostensible if so what it is real price? OPP 
4. Whether the suit in hand is not maintainable as the suit 
property has been returned to the original vendor? 
OPD 
5. Whether the suit property has not been properly valued 
for the purpose of Court fee? OPD 
6. Relief. 
And recorded evidence of the parties and decreed the suit on 
06.12.2012. Zahid Khan, petitioner No.1, filed appeal which was 
dismissed by the appellate Court on 16.03.2016. Hence, this Civil 
Revision. 
3. 
I have heard the arguments of learned counsels for the 
parties and have gone through the record. 
4. 
As regard maintainability of the suit, the trial Court 
framed Issue No.4. Admittedly, respondent/plaintiff challenged 

 
C.R.No.550-D/2016 
 
3
mutation No.1282 dated 16.04.2008 in respect of the suit land. 
Thereafter, the suit land was sold back and entry of the 
transaction was incorporated on 29.04.2008 by the defendants to 
ex-owner Muhammad Aslam and official fee of the mutation was 
paid through challan Form No.4 dated 06.05.2008 and Mutation 
No.1290 (Ex.D-3) was sanctioned on 07.05.2008 and the suit was 
also filed on same day i.e. 07.05.2008. Thus the sanctioning of 
resale mutation and filing of the pre-emption suit was on the one 
and the same date i.e. 07.05.2008. As the right of preemption 
emanates from Section 5 of the Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1991 
which is stipulated with the sale of immovable property with 
permanent transfer of the title as well as the performance of the 
mandatory Talab as per law. The word “sale” has been defined in 
Section 2(d) of the Act ibid as under: 
“(d)  “sale” means permanent transfer of the ownership of an 
immovable property in exchange for a valuable consideration 
and includes transfer of an immovable property by way of 
„hiba bil-iwaz‟ or „hiba ba-shart-ul-iwaz‟, but does not 
include— 
 
 (i)  transfer of an immovable property through inheritance or 
will or gift, other than „hiba bil-iwaz‟ or „hiba ba-shart-ul-
iwaz‟; 
 
(ii)  a sale in execution of a decree for money or of any order 
of a civil, criminal, revenue or any other court or a Revenue 
Officer or any local authority; 
 
             (iii)  exchange of agricultural land; and 
 
 (iv)  transfer of an immovable property for a consideration 
other than valuable consideration, such as the transfer of an 
immovable property by way of dower or composition in a 
murder or hurt case.” 
 
Similarly, Under Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, 
the Sale has been defined as under:- 
“54. Sale defined. 'Sale' is a transfer of ownership in 
exchange for a price paid or promised or part paid and part 
promised.  
Sale how made. Such transfer, in the case of tangible 
immovable property of the value of one hundred rupees and 
upwards, or in the case of a reversion or other intangible 
thing, can be made only by a registered instrument.  

 
C.R.No.550-D/2016 
 
4
In the case of tangible immovable property, of a value 
less than one hundred rupees, such transfer may be made 
either by a registered instrument or by delivery of the 
property.  
Delivery of tangible immovable property takes place 
when the seller places the buyer, or such person as he directs 
in possession of the property.  
Contract for sale - A contract for the sale of 
immovable property is a contract that a sale of such property 
shall take place on terms settled between the parties.  
It does not, of itself, create any interest in or charge on 
such property.” 
Meaning of the word “Sale” in Black‟s Law Dictionary is as 
under:- 
“1.The transfer of property or title for a price. 2. The 
agreement by which such a transfer takes place. The four 
elements are (1) parties competent to contract (2) mutual assent 
(3) a thing capable of being transferred, and (4) a price in 
money paid or promised.”  
Thus the conjoint reading of the above provision of law as 
well as the pari materia, it can be said that the sale means 
transaction of any land with permanent transfer of title / 
ownership against payment of price in the shape of money, thus a 
“sale” is transfer of ownership of immovable property in 
exchange for a price paid or promised or partly paid or partly 
promised and for such transaction, payment of price must be 
contemplated; same must be followed by the delivery of 
possession, whereas mere registration of the document of sale 
deed and attestation of mutation in favour of the vendee is 
amounted to  mature title of the vendee which is mere a 
subsequent event for the fiscal purpose or to  update the official 
record. Reliance is placed on a case cited as Muhammad Khuibaib 
Vs. Ghulam Mustafa (deceased) through LRs (2020 CLC 1039). In 
this case, all the ingredients of resale were completed prior to filing 
of the suit on 07.05.2008 and sanction of mutation is mere a 
formality even then it was sanctioned on 07.05.2008 when the suit 
was filed, whereas the schedule for sanctioning of mutation 
normally takes a few days before sanctioning of it, thus the resale             

 
C.R.No.550-D/2016 
 
5
of preempted land had taken place much before filing of the suit. 
Reliance in this regard is placed on a case cited as Muhammad 
Nazeef Khan Vs. Gulbat Khan and others (2012 SCMR 235).  
5. 
It is further observed that admittedly the suit land was sold 
back to the ex-vendor Muhammad Aslam through mutation dated 
29.04.2008 which was sanctioned on 07.05.2008 and this 
transaction was not preempted and even the sale transaction 
affected through mutation No.1290 dated 20.06.2008 was also 
not pre-empted by the respondent, thus his suit is not 
maintainable. Reliance in this regard is placed on case titled as 
Muhammad Hashim versus Sona Khan and 5 others (2015 CLC 
223) wherein it is held as under: 
“11. The amended plaint filed by the petitioner/plaintiff 
reveals that the legal heirs of Lashkar Ali Khan were arrayed 
as party to the suit in the panel of the defendants with addition 
in the same prayer of possession through pre-emption that 
subsequent sale-deed No.1102 attested on 1-5-2001 in the 
name of Lashkar Ali Khan by defendant No.1 was wrong, 
illegal and ineffective upon the rights of the plaintiff. 
However, no suit for pre-emption was filed against the 
subsequent sale and the petitioners having maintained their 
stance to question the previous sale effected through registered 
deed No.635 attested on 12-3-2001 through exercise of right of 
pre-emption. 
The 
subsequent 
transaction 
remained 
unchallenged, so far as the exercise of right of pre-emption is 
concerned, while the previous sale for all practical purposes 
has been ended and is no more in existence. Needless to 
mention that talbs allegedly made against the previous 
transaction and plaintiff has made no talb against the 
subsequent transaction, as no suit for pre- emption has been 
filed against it. This state of affairs leads one to the conclusion 
that the defendants/vendees were not restrained from the 
transfer of property in the name of vendor or anyone else prior 
to the institution of suit and in the instant case, the same 
transfer took place even prior to the alleged Talb-e-
Muwathibat and notice of Talb-e-Ishhad on behalf of the 
plaintiff. The right of the plaintiff, if vendee entered into fresh 
transaction/sale during the pendency of suit, would not be 
affected but if prior to the institution of suit neither section 22 
of the N.-W.F.P. Pre-emption Act, 1987 nor section 52 of the 
Transfer of Property Act, 1882 would be applicable and the 
applicant would have no right whatsoever to claim any 
embargo upon the resale in accordance with law.”

And in a case titled Muhammad Mansha and another versus 
Muhammad Nawaz (2014 MLD 1346) it is held as under: 
“6. In the case in hand, the appellants purchased the suit land 
from Hamad Naseer through an oral sale which was entered in 
the revenue record vide Mutation No. 966 dated 31-12-2009 
(Annex-H). It was the case of the respondent that he came to 
know about the above said sale on 11-2-2010 through 
Maqsood Ahmad son of Muhammad Abdullah in presence of 
Zaka Ullah Bhindar and Muhammad Asim while he was 
sitting in his Dera situated in village Sheikhupura Baidad; and, 
that after getting the knowledge of above said sale he declared 
his intention to exercise his right of pre-emption in respect of 
the above said sale. The respondent on 6-3-2010 instituted a 
suit for possession of the suit property through pre-emption. 
During pendency of suit, Mutation No.966 stood cancelled by 
the Revenue Officer vide order dated 15-3-2010. This fact has 
not been denied by the respondent. Now, a question arises as 
to whether after cancellation of sale Mutation No. 966 the 
cause of action to file a suit ceased to exist. Answer to the 
above said question is in affirmative for the simple reason that 
as per section 5 of the Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1991 the right 
of pre-emption arises in case of sale of immovable property. It 
means that when there is no sale of immovable property; there 
is no right of pre-emption. The right of pre- emption is not a 
right of re-purchase, either from the vendor or from the 
vendee, involving any new contract of sale but it is simply a 
right of substitution, entitling the pre-emptor, by reason of 
legal incident to which the sale itself was subject, to stand in 
the shoes of the vendee in respect of all rights and obligation 
arising from the sale under which he has derived his title. It is, 
in fact, as if in a sale deed the vendee's name is rubbed out and 
the pre-emptor's name is inserted in its place. Thus, when the 
sale or contract of sale ceases to exist then the right to pre- 
empt the sale also stands extinguished. The cancellation or 
revocation of sale, even during pendency of suit, terminates 
the right of pre-emption as it is an established principle of law 
that pre-emptor in order to succeed must successfully establish 
such right on the day of sale, on the day of filing a suit pre-
empting the sale and its continued subsistence till the day of 
decree. In the instant case, the respondent claimed his right on 
the basis of sale made in favour of the appellant vide Mutation 
No. 966. Thus, when the above said mutation stood cancelled, 
the cause of action to file a suit for pre-emption also stood 
extinguished as the suit property stood reverted to the original 
owner. In these circumstances the learned Trial Court validly 
rejected the plaint under Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C.” 
 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis supplied)  
As the suit land was resold  by the petitioners/defendants to 
the original owner through mutation No.1290 as such the suit 

 
C.R.No.550-D/2016 
 
7
filed by the respondent/plaintiff was not maintainable. As such, 
the findings of the Courts below on this issue are illegal and same 
deserve reversal and this issue is decided in favour of the 
petitioners/defendants and against the respondent/plaintiff. 
6. 
As regard the performance of Talbs, in this regard, issue 
No.2 was framed and onus whereof was placed upon the plaintiff. 
To dislodge the onus of this issue, Muhammad Ahsan, 
plaintiff/P.W.1 deposed that on 23.04.2008 12‟o clock on 
Wednesday, he was sitting at his shop of Khal Chokar situated in 
Malik Market and at that time Muhammad Iqbal and Mansoor 
Abbas were also sitting there, when Muhammad Asif came there 
at 12 noon and informed him regarding the impugned sale 
mutation upon which he at once announced to pre-empt the sale. 
Muhammad Iqbal (P.W.2) deposed that: 
"

(emphasis supplied) 
 
 
Muhammad Asif (P.W.3/informer) deposed that: 
"

In cross examination, he deposed that:

The P.W.3 is the alleged informer who stated that he was sitting 
with Patwari at about 09:45 a.m. and thereafter within an hour he 

 
C.R.No.550-D/2016 
 
8
reached to the plaintiff. Be that as it may, the witness reached to 
the plaintiff at about 11 a.m. whereas the plaintiff deposed that 
informer (P.W.3) reached to his shop at 12 noon. Thus, the 
testimony of the informer with regard to time of imparting the 
information of sale is clearly at variance with the statement of the 
other PWs and it evinces from the above deposition of PWs as 
well as the story of receipt of information is a self-created and 
concocted one. Thus, these major contradictions in the 
testimonies of the witnesses regarding the time of receipt of the 
information of the impugned sale are considered grave in nature 
which badly affect the preemptory cause of the respondent. 
Reliance is placed on the case reported as Allah Ditta through 
LRs & Others Vs. Muhammad Anar (2013 SCMR 866), the 
relevant portion whereof is reproduced as under:- 
“2. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and find vital 
discrepancy in the statements of P.W.1, P.W.2 and P.W.3 
particularly, PW.1 and PW.2, P.W.3 stated that the disclosure 
of the sale of suit land was made to them while the plaintiff 
was sitting inside the shop of Aziz, whereas the informer who 
is the son of the pre-emptor, PW.3 Muhammad Rafique, has 
contradicted the above and in unequivocal, clear and 
unambiguous terms stated that they were sitting outside the 
shop. This was a material discrepancy but the learned 
Appellate Court had failed to notice the same and it has also 
been overlooked by the learned Revisional Court……” 
Further the respondent/plaintiff also did not produce witness 
Malik Mansoor Abbas who was allegedly present with him at the 
time of receipt of the information and no explanation has been 
furnished in this regard, as such he failed to prove the 
performance of Talb-i-Muwathibat as per law. 
7. 
Next with regard to performance of Talb-e-Ishhad, The 
petitioner/vendee denied the receipt of any notice of Talb-i-
Ishhad thus the respondent/plaintiff was under obligation to 
substantiate the postal service of notice upon the vendees. The 
respondent/plaintiff produced Mushtaq Ahmad (P.W.4) who 
allegedly served the notices of the Talb-i-Ishhad through 

 
C.R.No.550-D/2016 
 
9
registered post A.D but he was not actual postman of the said 
post office. During cross examination he deposed that: 
"
 ںیم ڈااخکہن اک لقتسم المزم ہن وہں۔۔۔ ہی درتس ےہ ہک اشدی اخن ڈااخکہن ںیم لقتسم ڈاہیک
وموجد ےہ۔ ہی درتس ےہ ہک ڈاہیک ذمصقر اشدی اخن یک دح کت ڈاک میسقت رکات ےہ۔" 
 
 
 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
 
but the P.W.4 neither stated that he was handed over any 
notice/letter to affect service upon defendant Muhammad Javed 
nor served the same upon him. Thus the respondent/plaintiff 
failed to prove the service of notice of Talb-i-Ishhad as per law. 
Reliance is placed on cases titled as Munawar Hussain & Others 
Vs Afaq Ahmed (2013 SCMR 721) and Muhammad Riaz Vs. 
Muhammad Ramzan (2023 SCMR 1305). Moreover, initially the 
suit was filed against four defendants whereas the registered A.D 
were produced in respect of three defendants out of which only 
one was allegedly served in person whereas two notices were not 
personally served upon the other vendees. Non-production of the 
acknowledgment receipt (A.D) amounts to withholding of 
material evidence, which flaw has grave adverse effect on the 
case of the respondent/plaintiff. Reliance is placed on the cases 
titled as Bashir Ahmed Vs. Ghulam Rasool (2011 SCMR 762) 
and Muhammad Riaz Vs. Muhammad Ramzan (2023 SCMR 
1305). 
  
Further, the respondent/plaintiff has not produced Malik 
Mansoor Abbas the witness of notice of Talb-i-Ishhad nor any 
explanation has been furnished in this regard. Thus, it is 
amounted to withholding of the best evidence and it would be 
legally presumed that had the said witness produced in the 
evidence, he would have deposed unfavourable against the 
respondent/plaintiff and presumption under Article 129 (g) of 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 goes against him, as such the 
respondent/plaintiff failed to prove the service of notice of Talb-i-
Ishhad as well. Reliance is placed on the case of Sughran Bibi Vs. 
Mst. Aziz Begum & 4 Others (1996 SCMR 137) and Jehangir Vs 

 
C.R.No.550-D/2016 
 
10
Mst. Shams Sultana & Others (2022 SCMR 309). Moreover, the 
performance of mandatory Talb as envisaged under Section 13 of 
the Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1991 has much significance as it 
lays or dismantles the foundation of the very suit and skip off or 
non-performance of a single Talb demolishes the whole 
superstructure of the pre-emptory cause even though the 
remaining Talbs have been performed. Reliance is placed on a 
judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan titled as Sardar 
Muhammad (deceased) through LRs. Vs. Taj Muhammad 
(deceased) through LRs and others (2023 SCMR 1113). 
 
In view of above, it can conveniently be held that the 
respondent/plaintiff failed to prove the performance of Talbs as 
per law, as such the findings of the learned Courts below on issue 
No.2 are hereby reversed and this issue is decided against the 
respondent/plaintiff and in favour of the petitioners/defendants. 
8. 
As regard the objection raised by learned counsel for the 
respondent that instant revision petition is not maintainable on the 
ground that only petitioner No.1/Zahid Khan, one out of the three 
defendants before the trial Court has challenged the judgment & 
decree of the trial Court through an appeal whereas rest of the 
defendants have not assailed the same and to the extent of rest of 
the defendants, the judgment & decree of the learned trial Court 
has attained the status of finality. Suffice it to say in this regard 
that under Section 115 C.P.C this Court has jurisdiction to 
entertain and adjudicate the matter if it appears from decision of 
the subordinate Courts that the lower fora have exercised 
jurisdiction not vested in it by law or failed to exercise a 
jurisdiction so vested, or have acted in the exercise of its 
jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity. In this case 
petitioner No.1/Zahid Khan, one of the defendants, challenged 
the judgment & decree of the trial Court through this Revision 
Petition and record of the case is appended with it. As the 
respondent-plaintiff  filed suit for possession through pre-emption 

 
C.R.No.550-D/2016 
 
11
but as discussed above he has failed to prove the performance of 
mandatory Talbs as per law which factum has escaped from the 
consideration of the trial Court who by committing misreading 
and non-reading  of the evidence and misapplication of law, 
decreed the suit for possession through pre-emption and similar 
blatant illegality was also committed by the appellate Court who 
upheld the decision of the trial Court, thus this Court under 
Section 115 C.P.C has suo motu jurisdiction to look into the 
available record or call for the record of its subordinate courts 
who have  committed material illegalities & irregularities and 
may pass appropriate order as it deems fit. Reliance in this regard 
is placed on a case cited as Hafeez Ahmad and others Vs. Civil 
Judge, Lahore and others (PLD 2012 SC 400). The Supreme 
Court of Pakistan has settled an alike question in a case cited as 
Naseem Ahmad and another Vs. Air Botswana (Pty) Ltd. and 5 
others (1993 SCMR 647) by holding that in appropriate cases 
under Section 115 C.P.C, a High Court has jurisdiction to 
interfere when the lower fora exercised their jurisdiction 
excessively or committed material illegalities and irregularities. 
For ready reference, relevant portion of the judgment (supra) is 
reproduced as under: 
  
“However, the view taken above has to some extent been 
modified by this Court in subsequent judgments delivered by 
this Court and the view subsequently taken is that undoubtedly 
the Courts will ordinarily decline to exercise revisional 
jurisdiction wherein alternative remedy is available but this 
should not be regarded as an inflexible rule to be followed 
rigidly without exception because in special circumstances of a 
case, a departure from this rule could be justified. Thus, this 
Court in Manager, Jammu and Kashmir State Property in 
Pakistan and others v. Khuda Yar and another (PLD 1975 SC 
678) inter alia observed:-- 
 
"As a general rule the principle to be followed in all such 
discretionary matters is that special and extraordinary 
powers ought not to be exercised in favour of an 
applicant who has been negligent in pursuing the normal 
remedies open to him. Thus where an appeal lay to some 
other Court and could have been filed if the applicant was 
diligent but he has not done so, then the High Court 

 
C.R.No.550-D/2016 
 
12
should not ordinarily entertain a revision even if the order 
or decision complained of does not amount to a 
decree...................... 
 
This rule is not, however, an inflexible one and it will, no 
doubt, depend upon the special circumstances of each 
case whether it will be followed or not." 
 
and recently in the case of Messrs United Bank Limited v. 
Yousuf Haji Noor Muhammad Dhadhi (1988 SCMR 82) after 
noticing the above-mentioned two decisions it was observed:-- 
 
"Learned counsel also contended, on the basis of 
Municipal Committee v. Sh. Aziz Elahi (PLD 1970 SC 
506) and S. Azizul Hassan and another v. Malik Ghulam 
Muhammad (1971 SCMR 123), that no revision under 
section 115 was competent if no appeal was preferred 
from the order which was appealable. This point, 
however, is concluded and determined by a judgment of 
this Court in Manager, Jammu and Kashmir State 
Property in Pakistan v. Khuda Yar and another (PLD 
1975 SC 678), in which it was held that although 
ordinarily Courts have declined to exercise revisional 
jurisdiction where an alternative remedy is available, yet 
this is not an inflexible rule to be rigidly followed and a 
departure could be justifiably made if required from 
circumstances of the case. Having regard to all the 
circumstances of this case we feel that in this case the 
High Court ought to have entertained the revision 
application and set aside the order impugned before it 
whereby the plaintiffs were non-suited for a trivial 
formality." 
 
  
In our opinion, the present was a fit case justifying a 
departure from the normal rule and in which the High Court 
should have exercised jurisdiction. The case raised a serious 
question of law namely whether in the circumstances of the 
case, the learned Judge in the High Court was right in holding 
that the Courts at Karachi did not have the jurisdiction to 
entertain the suit when the offices of at least two defendants 
were located in Karachi, although the claim for damages and 
short delivery of the goods pertains to the carriage undertaken 
by the airlines outside Pakistan. An authoritative decision of 
the High Court was necessary in the light of section 20, C.P.C. 
and Article 28 of the first schedule to the Carriage by Air Act, 
1934. The last mentioned Article states that an action for 
damages must be brought at the option of the plaintiff either 
before the Court having jurisdiction where the carrier is 
ordinarily resident, or has his principal place of business, or 
has an establishment by which the contract has been made or 
before the Court having jurisdiction at the place of destination. 
Four alternatives have been provided to give jurisdiction to a 
Court in a dispute coming under this Act. This being the first 
case of its kind required consideration in depth by the High

Court. Moreso for the reason that in the present case, six Air 
Companies were involved having their head offices in different 
countries, considering that the present day air travel has 
become so common that a passenger expects to receive redress 
of his grievance at a place which is more convenient to him if 
a branch office is also established at a place of suing.” 
Thus the objection / argument of learned counsel for the 
respondent is misconceived and same is hereby repelled.

The Courts below have committed blatant misreading and 
non-reading of the evidence and have also failed to apply the 
correct law which rendered the said dicta as not sustainable in the 
eyes of law. This Court, under Section 115 C.P.C, has jurisdiction 
to interfere in the perverse concurrent judgments & decrees of the 
learned lower fora. Reliance is placed on the case of Nazim-ud-
Din & Others Vs. Sheikh Zia-Ul-Qamar & Others (2016 SCMR 
24).  
 
10. 
In view of above, this civil revision is allowed, the 
judgment & decree dated 06.02.2012 passed by the learned trial 
Court as well as the judgment & decree dated 16.03.2016 of the 
learned appellate Court are set aside and the suit for  preemption 
of the respondent/plaintiff is hereby dismissed. No order as to 
costs.
