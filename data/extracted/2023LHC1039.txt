C.M.No.3 of 2022 
 
JAWAD HASSAN, J.  Through this Application under Sections 
19(7) and 2(b) of the Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) 
Ordinance, 2001 (the “Ordinance”), the Applicant/Judgment Debtor 
has sought transfer of the Execution Application bearing No.64900 of 
2017 to the Banking Court while taking the plea of lack of pecuniary 
jurisdiction of this Court.  
I. 
CONTEXT  
2. 
The background against filing of this Application is that MCB 
Bank Limited (the “decree-holder”) filed a suit under Section 9 of the 
“Ordinance” against M/s. MAZCO industries Private Limited etc (the 
“Applicant”) for recovery of an amount of Rs.109.460 million during 
pendency of which, the parties arrived at the Settlement Agreement 
dated 04.03.2017 (Mark-A) and on the basis of the terms and 
conditions chalked out in it, both the parties made a joint Application 
(C.M.No.317-B of 2017) under Section XXIII Rules 1,2 and 3 of the 
CPC thereupon this Court with consent of the parties, decreed the suit 
in favour of the decree-holder bank, vide order dated 12.05.2017.  On 
another joint Application (C.M.No.1 of 2021) made on behalf of the 

C.M.No.03 of 2022  
            IN

decree-holder and Defendants No.1, 2, 3 and 5 for bringing on record 
the First Supplemental to the Settlement Agreement dated 04.03.2017 
(termed to be First Supplemental Agreement by the Court) and seeking 
modification in the already passed consent decree in terms thereof. 
Thereupon, the aforesaid consent decree dated 12.05.2017 was 
modified by this Court, vide order dated 18.01.2021 and the decretal 
amount was further reduced to 64.900 million.   
II. 
SUBMISSION OF PARTIES 
3. 
It is contended by learned counsel for the Applicant/judgment-
debtor that there is no denial that the decree holder bank filed suit for 
recovery of an amount of Rs.109.460 million against the judgment 
debtors but after passing of the consent decree, vide order dated 
12.05.2017 and thereafter its modification vide order dated 18.01.2021, 
the decretal amount has become at Rs.64.900 million, which reads as 
under:- 
“………The decree-holder bank acceded to 
the said request where after the parties 
executed the First Supplemental agreement 
which contains the mode and manner for 
payment of the balance settlement amount of 
Rs.64.900 Million. The First Supplemental 
agreement 
also 
provides 
for 
the 
consequences of the default in payment of 
the balance settlement liability. According to 
learned counsel for the parties, the First 
Supplemental agreement is in continuation 
of and shall be read into settlement 
agreement dated 04.03.2017. 
 
3. 
In view of the contents of the 
application, it is allowed and the First 
Supplemental agreement is allowed to be 
brought on record as Mark-A. The terms of 

C.M.No.03 of 2022  
            IN

consent decree passed on 12.05.2017 shall 
stand modified to the extent of the 
stipulations 
contained 
in 
the 
First 
Supplemental agreement. ” 
 
 
Mr. Muhammad Imran Malik, ASC further submitted that in 
view of the supra order dated 18.01.2021, this Court has modified the 
Consent Decree, therefore, this Court lacks jurisdiction thus, the suit is 
required to be transferred to the banking court. He added that there is 
no denial that the decree-holder bank filed suit for recovery of 
Rs.109.460 Million (above 100 million) but, as stated above, after 
passing of the supra decree, the amount claimed by the decree-holder 
bank had been reduced to 64.900 million from 109.460 million which 
falls within the pecuniary jurisdiction of the Banking Court instead of 
this Court. Therefore, the execution proceedings initiated against the 
judgment-debtor are liable to be transferred to the Banking Court due 
to lack of pecuniary jurisdiction of this Court in terms of Section 2(b) 
of the “Ordinance”. Learned counsel relied on the judgment reported 
as “Habib Bank Limited through Attorneys v. Messrs Rehmania 
Textiles Mills (Pvt.) Limited Jhang Road, Faisalabad” (2003 CLD 
689). 
4. 
 Ms. Minahil Khan, Advocate for the decree-holder bank 
questioned maintainability of this Application by stating that it is a 
settled law that the Court which initially assumes the jurisdiction on 
the basis of the value fixed by a decree-holder in a plaint is the only 
forum which has the pecuniary jurisdiction to execute the decree and to 
decide all the ancillary matters relating to the same, therefore, this 
Court does not lack jurisdiction as claimed by the judgment-debtor. 
Places reliance on Mashraq Bank versus Messrs Amtul Rehman 
Industries (Pvt.) Limited and others (2002 CLD 336) and MCB Bank 
Limited through Duly Authorized Attorney versus Eden Developers 
(Pvt.) Limited and others (2019 CLD 219).    
5. 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the 
record.

III. 
DETERMINATION BY THE COURT 
6. 
The main grievance of the Applicant/judgment-debtor agitated 
through this Application revolves around the question of pecuniary 
jurisdiction of the Court, leaning upon which, he has sought transfer of 
the main Execution Application (EX.A.64900/2021) to the Banking 
Court, in view of the consent decree passed and subsequently modified 
by the supra orders by this Court, in view of the terms and conditions 
chalked out in Settlement Agreements arrived at between the parties 
with their mutual consent. The learned counsel for the Applicant while 
placing reliance upon the observations made in Habib Bank Limited 
Case, supra took the stance that after decision of a suit by a Banking 
Court, it is the adjudicated claim as decreed by the Banking Court 
which becomes the subject matter of the case in execution proceedings 
for the purposes of determination of pecuniary jurisdiction of this 
Court.  
7. 
The stance of learned counsel for the applicant is misconceived 
because a careful perusal of the record made it crystal clear that the 
original claim of the respondent Bank was and still is Rs.109.466 
million which is also an admitted position in view of the original 
settlement agreement dated 04.03.2017 as well as the first 
supplemental agreement dated 12.11.2020. This is because the consent 
decree dated 12.05.2017 is only a conditional decree with the condition 
that the Respondent Bank’s claim of Rs.109.466 million is still intact 
and revivable in case of breach of the settlement agreement dated 
04.03.2017 by the instant applicant in view of clause 4.2 of the same 
which is reproduced under for better understanding: 
“Notwithstanding anything contained, any 
default by the Customers, of the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement executed by 
the Customer(s) in favor of the Bank shall 
be considered as default by the Customers 
under 
this 
Agreement, 
and 
as 
a 
consequence, such default will trigger the 

C.M.No.03 of 2022  
            IN 
Ex.A.No.64900-2021 
 
 
- 5 -
execution of the Consent Decree passed by 
the Honourable Court and all/any wavier of 
the amounts of Costs of Funds, charges, 
Markups, in addition to admitted and 
acknowledged 
outstanding 
amount 
of 
Rs.109.460 M as of 30.04.2016 which shall 
be recoverable through Execution of the 
Consent Decree against the Customers, 
Jointly and Severally”. 
This clause clearly indicates that original claim of the Respondent 
Bank is still intact.  
8. 
On the other hand, in MCB BANK LIMITED through Duly 
Authorized Attorney Versus EDEN DEVELOPERS (PVT.) 
LIMITED and others (2019 CLD 219), the Court while interpreting 
and elaborating section 19 of the “Ordinance” observed that as per 
section 19 of the “Ordinance”, a banking suit on pronouncement of 
a judgment even in case of consent decree automatically stands 
converted into execution proceedings before the same court which 
decided the case as the tenor of section 19 is without equivocation 
and the conversion is statutorily mandated. The Court further 
observed as follows: 
“One may also visualize a situation where 
the amount of decree ultimately passed by 
this Court may be much less than the 
amount claimed in the suit by a plaintiff 
and which amount may fall below the 
threshold of pecuniary limit for the High 
Court to exercise its jurisdiction. Can it 
be said in that case that the execution of 
the decree be transmitted to the Banking 
Court for further proceedings? Clearly 
the answer to this question is in the 

C.M.No.03 of 2022  
            IN 
Ex.A.No.64900-2021 
 
 
- 6 -
negative and the proceedings will be held 
in the High Court which passed the 
decree in the first place.” 
 
The Court further held that the Banking Court which initially 
assumed the jurisdiction on the basis of the value fixed by the 
decree-holder in the plaint was the only forum which had the 
pecuniary jurisdiction to execute the decree and to decide all 
ancillary matters relating to the execution, discharge and satisfaction 
of the decree. 
9. 
This argument is further strengthen by the view taken in 
MUHAMMAD KHALID alias KHALID MEHMOOD and others 
Versus MUHAMMAD YOUSAF and others (2017 YLR 2347) 
wherein the court held that where a consent decree had been 
challenged, the pecuniary jurisdiction would be determined on the 
basis of the plaint of the original suit. It was further held in 
MASHRAQ 
BANK 
Versus 
Messrs 
AMTUL 
REHMAN 
INDUSTRIES (PVT.) LIMITED and others (2002 CLD 336)  that it 
is settled law that the valuation of the suit, itself fixed by the plaintiff 
in the plaint, determines the jurisdiction of the Court and will 
subsequently be the basis for determination of the forum for the 
purposes of filing of the appeal etc. Similarly it has been held in 
MUHAMMAD YOUSAF versus Mrs. MUHAMMAD MOHSIN and 
5 another (1986 MLD 342) that the valuation in the plaint normally 
determines the jurisdiction of Court, which is determined in 
accordance with the Suits Valuation Act, 1887. The Court can interfere 
to correct the valuation given in the plaint where, it is based upon 
misrepresentation or fraud. If during the pendency of the suit the value 
of subject-matter is increased, the Court will not lose jurisdiction 
because jurisdiction once obtained is not taken away by increase in the 
value of the subject-matter and the Court can proceed with the 
adjudication of the suit. This would mean by necessary implication that 
the court will also not lose jurisdiction by decrease in the value of the 

C.M.No.03 of 2022  
            IN 
Ex.A.No.64900-2021 
 
 
- 7 -
suit once it rightly assumed pecuniary jurisdiction at the first place and 
passed a consent decree. On the other hand the judgment relied upon 
by the applicant does not hold the field as it has no binding force in 
view of Mashraq Bank Case and Muhammad Yousaf Case supra 
being earlier in time. The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the 
case of “Dr. PIR MUHAMMAD KHAN Versus KHUDA BUKHSH and 
others” (2015 SCMR 1243) has held that “for the purposes of 
ascertaining the pecuniary jurisdiction, it will be the valuation shown 
in the plaint which will be material for this purpose”.  
10. 
Even otherwise, the conduct of the judgment-debtor shows that 
the instant objection to the pecuniary jurisdiction is just taken in order 
to unnecessarily linger on the execution proceedings to deprive the 
decree-holder bank of the timely fruits of the consent decree, as the 
judgment-debtor never took this plea at the time of filing of the instant 
suit and instead admitted the claim of the Respondent Bank of 
Rs.109.466 Million as is evident from the original agreement as well as 
the first supplemental agreement. It is also pertinent to mention here 
that the applicant never took such objection qua pecuniary jurisdiction 
despite the fact that originally in view of the settlement agreement the 
consent decree was initially passed for Rs.99.900 million as is evident 
from Clause “C” of final supplemental agreement and not for 
Rs.64.900 Million, as claimed by the applicant but despite that fact that 
the said amount was below Rs.100 million the applicant never objected 
to the same for his own benefit because the Respondent Bank 
conditionally waived off the claims regarding amounts of costs of 
funds, charges, markups etc. as evident from both said agreements, 
which would otherwise made the claim as Rs.109.466 Million.  
11. 
Moreover the applicant while taking further concession under 
first supplemental agreement once again did not take any objection 
regarding the pecuniary jurisdiction of the court and took further 
concessions from the Respondent Bank while reducing the claim to 
Rs.64.900 million and it was only at this belated stage on 09.04.2022 

C.M.No.03 of 2022  
            IN 
Ex.A.No.64900-2021 
 
 
- 8 -
when the applicant took such a plea for the first time after getting 
further relaxation and benefits in the form of rescheduling of the 
payment plan that this court lacks of pecuniary jurisdiction obviously 
to avoid or delay further timely payments under the said agreements 
between the parties. Hence at present stage, the applicant’s plea is also 
hit by the Doctrine of approbate and reprobate and the applicant would 
be estopped from taking such position because as per the Doctrine of 
estoppel which though is described as a rule of evidence but may have 
effect of constituting substantive rights and this Doctrine of estoppel is 
founded on equity and justness with straightforward objective to 
prevent fraud and ensure justice. Reliance is placed upon SARDAR 
ALI KHAN Versus STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN and others 
(2022 SCMR 1454) wherein it was further held as follows: 
“The maxim qui approbate non-reprobate 
(one who approbates cannot reprobate) is 
firmly embodied in English common law. 
It is akin to the doctrine of benefits and 
burdens which at its most basic level 
provides that a person taking advantage 
under an instrument which both grants a 
benefit and imposes a burden cannot take 
the former without complying with the 
latter. A person cannot approbate and 
reprobate or accept and reject the same 
instrument.” 
 
12. 
The applicant on the one hand accepted concession of easy 
installments along with conditional waiving off the claims regarding 
amounts of costs of funds, charges, markups etc. while not objecting 
to the original decree despite the same being less than a 100 Million 
and not even at subsequent stage of modified agreement while 
taking further concessions but on the other hand took  a totally 
different plea of lack of pecuniary jurisdiction at much belated stage 
apparently 
to 
avoid 
scheduled 
and 
agreed 
upon 
payments/installments. In these circumstances, if the stance of the 
applicant/judgment debtor is to be accepted as correct then as a 
necessary consequence the initial consent decree is also liable to be 

C.M.No.03 of 2022  
            IN 
Ex.A.No.64900-2021 
 
 
- 9 -
set aside on the sole ground of being coram non judice and in that 
case the applicant/judgment debtor is admittedly bound to pay 
Rs.109.460 million claim of the respondent Bank. 
13. 
Therefore, in view of the above, I am of the considered view that 
there is no substance in this Application seeking transfer of the 
execution proceedings to the banking court on the ground of pecuniary 
jurisdiction. This Application is, therefore, dismissed.
