of Muhammad Ramzan son of Noor Muhammad  (deceased) and  
directed to pay Rs.500,000/- as compensation under section  544-A,

The convict was ordered to be hanged by his neck till dead.  
 
 
Khizar Hayat, Shah Muhammad and Muhammad Fayyaz alias Kali, the co-accused 
of the convict, were however acquitted by the learned trial court. 
2. 
 Feeling aggrieved, Shahid @ Shahra son of Jalal  (convict) lodged Criminal 
Appeal No.953-J of 2018 through Jail assailing his conviction and sentence. The 
learned trial court submitted Murder Reference No.11 of 2019 under section 374 
Cr.P.C. seeking confirmation or otherwise of the sentence of death awarded to the 
appellant namely Shahid @ Shahra son of Jalal . The complainant of the case 
namely Barkhurdar filed Criminal Appeal No.1154 of 2018  against the acquittal of 
the accused namely Khizar Hayat, Shah Muhammad and Muhammad Fayyaz alias 
Kali by the learned trial court. We intend to decide the Criminal Appeal No. 953-J 
of  2018, the Criminal Appeal No.1154 of 2018 and  Murder Reference No.11 of  
2019  through this single judgment. 
3. 
Precisely, the necessary facts of the prosecution case, as stated by 
Barkhurdar (PW-5), the complainant of the case, are as under:- 
 
“Stated that I am resident of chak No.21/8R and our "Bhenni" is situated 
in our land in our chak. On 19/20/08.2016 at about 12:15 A.M I alongwith 
Muhammad Ramzan (deceased) my brother Muhammad Iqbal and Ghulam Jafar 
s/o Muhammad Bakhsh Sanpal were present in the said house. Khizar Hayyat and 
Shahid alias Shahra called Muhammad Ramzan my brother on cell phone in his 
land. I alongwith my brother Muhammad Ramzan (deceased) my brother 
Muhammad Iqbal and aforesaid Ghulam Jafar s/o Muhammad Bakhsh proceeded 
to the nearby land of accused present in the court. When reached there we saw

Shahid alias Shahra armed with pistol, Khizar Hayyat armed with pistol, Fayyaz 
armed with Carbeen, Shah Muhammad armed with sota were present there. 
Shahid alias Shahra accused present in the court raised lalkara that they would 
teach him a lesson for a quarrelling with them. Fayyaz accused present in the 
court gave slape (sic) to my brother Muhammad Ramzan. Shahid alias Shahra 
accused present in the court made a fire shot from his pistol on the upper side 
right side of abdomen of my brother. Shahra accused made another fire shot with 
his pistol which hit on the inner side of right thigh of Muhammad Ramzan. Khizar 
Hayyat accused present in the court made fire shot with his pistol on the left thigh 
of my brother Muhammad Ramzan. Khizar Hayyat accused made a second shot 
with his pistol which hit on the right arm of my brother Muhammad Ramzan. 
Fayyaz accused present in the court made aerial firing with his carbine. Shahid 
kept on raising lalkara by saying that he would kill whosoever came near to him. 
Thereafter the accused decamped from the scene of occurrence. We took 
Muhammad Ramzan in injured condition at RHC, Tulamba where he succumbed 
to the aforesaid injuries. 
 
The motive behind the occurrence was that the accused Shahid alias 
Shahra and Khizar Hayyat used to bring the women of bad character near our 
house on the cots, whereupon Ramzan deceased forbid them to bring such type of 
women there. Due to that grudge this occurrence took place. I gave application 
Ex.PC which bears my signatures Ex.PC/1 which was correctly recorded.” 
 
4.     After the formal investigation of the case report under section 173 of the 
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 was submitted before the learned trial court and 
the accused were sent to face trial. The learned trial court framed the charge 
against the accused on 13.09.2017, to which the accused pleaded not guilty and 
claimed trial.

case, investigated the case from 24.10.2016 till 20.03.2017, arrested the appellant

statement before the learned trial court.     
6. 
The prosecution also got Dr. Muhammad Asif Imam (PW-7) examined, who 
on 20.08.2016 was posted as Medical Officer at RHC Talumba and on the same 
day conducted the postmortem examination of the dead body of Muhammad 
Ramzan son of Noor Muhammad (deceased). Dr. Muhammad  Asif Imam (PW-7)  
on examining the dead body of  Muhammad Ramzan son of Noor Muhammad 
(deceased) observed as under:-

OPINION. 
 
 In my opinion in this case death was due to shock and hemorrhage 
(internal and external) which was due to fatal injuries of abdominal viscera 
like liver, stomach small and large intestine which was due to injury No.1. 
Injury No.1 individually and Injury No.1 to 6 collectively were sufficient to 
cause death. Injury No.1 to 6 were antimortem in nature and were by firearm. 
 
7.    
On 29.08.2018, the learned Assistant District Public Prosecutor gave up the 
prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Jafar and Mazhar Ali as being unnecessary 
and closed the prosecution evidence after tendering in evidence the reports of the 
Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh. PR, Exh.PS, Exh. PT, Exh. PT/1 
and Exh.PU).  
8. 
After the closure of prosecution evidence, the learned trial court examined 
the appellant namely Shahid @ Shahra son of Jalal  under section 342 Cr.P.C. and 
in answer to the question why this case against you and why the PWs have deposed 
against you, he replied that he had been involved in the case falsely and was 
innocent. The appellant namely Shahid @ Shahra son of Jalal  opted not to get 
himself examined under section 340(2) Cr.P.C. and did not adduce any evidence in 
his defence.  
9. 
On the conclusion of the trial, the learned Additional Sessions Judge,  
Mianchannu convicted and sentenced the appellant as referred to above.

10. 
The primary contention of the learned counsel for the appellant is that the 
whole case is fabricated and false. The learned counsel for the appellant argued 
that the prosecution remained unable to prove the facts in issue and did not 
produce any unimpeachable, admissible and relevant evidence to prove the same. 
The learned counsel for the appellant further contended that the statements of the 
eye witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6)  were not 
worthy of any reliance. The learned counsel for the appellant also argued that the 
recoveries were full of procedural defects, of no legal worth and value and result of 
fake proceedings. The learned counsel for the appellant finally submitted that the 
prosecution had totally failed to prove the case against the appellant beyond the 
shadow of doubt.   
11. 
  On the other hand, the learned Additional Prosecutor General along with 
the learned counsel for the complainant contended that the prosecution had proved 
its case beyond shadow of doubt by producing independent witnesses. The learned 
Additional Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the complainant further 
argued that the deceased was murdered by the appellant. The learned Additional 
Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the complainant further argued that 
the recovery of the pistol (P-3, mentioned as P-1 in the statement of Muhammad 
Iqbal) from the appellant also corroborated the statements of the other witnesses. 
The learned Additional Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the 
complainant contended that there was no occasion for the prosecution witnesses, 
who were related to the deceased, to substitute the real offenders with the innocent 
in this case. The learned Additional Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for 
the complainant prayed for the rejection of the appeal as lodged by the appellant 
namely Shahid alias Shahra. The learned counsel for the complainant also argued

that the Criminal Appeal No.1154 of 2018, assailing the acquittal of Khizar Hayat, 
Shah Muhammad and Muhammad Fayyaz alias Kali by the learned trial court from 
the charges also merited acceptance. 
12. 
We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant, the learned counsel for 
the complainant, the learned Additional Prosecutor General and with their 
assistance carefully perused the record and evidence recorded during the trial. 
13.             The whole prosecution case revolves around the statements of the eye 
witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6). The 
relationship of the said witnesses with each other and the deceased is on record. 
Muhammad Ramzan son of Noor Muhammad, deceased, was the brother of 
Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6). It was also admitted by both the 
prosecution witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6) 
that the place of occurrence was at a distance of 3-4 acres from the house of the 
prosecution witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6). 
Barkhurdar (PW-5) during cross-examination stated as under:- 
“ The place of occurrence is at a distance of three acres from our house. ” 
(emphasis supplied). 
Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6) during cross-examination admitted as under:- 
“The place of occurrence is at a distance of 3/4 acres from our house ” 
We have also perused the scaled site plan of the place of occurrence (Exh.PB) as 
prepared by Raja Usman Yousaf Janjua , Draftsman (PW-4)  and the rough site 
plan of the place of occurrence (Exh.PN) as prepared by Zahid Mahmood, 
Inspector (PW-9), the Investigating Officer of the case, and find that  neither the 
place of the residence of the witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad 

Murder Reference No.11 of  2019

Iqbal (PW-6) nor any land owned and possessed by the witnesses namely 
Barkhurdar (PW-5)and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6)  are marked in the same. In view 
of the above mentioned facts, it can be validly held that the prosecution witnesses 
namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6) were “chance 
witnesses” and therefore were under a duty to explain and prove their presence at 
the place of occurrence, at the time of occurrence. A perusal of the statements of 
prosecution witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6) 
reveals that both the prosecution witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and 
Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6) failed to provide any reason, consistent with the 
attending circumstances, due to which reason they left their houses at night and 
proceeded to the place of occurrence. Though, it was not mentioned in the written 
application (Exh.PC)  as submitted by Barkhurdar (PW-5) to Zahid Mahmood, 
Inspector (PW-9) that the deceased had received a phone call on his mobile phone 
device  made by the appellant and his co-accused , asking the deceased to come 
and meet them and thereafter the deceased , at about 12.10 a.m (night) proceeded 
to the place of occurrence, however, prosecution witnesses namely Barkhurdar 
(PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6), in their statements recorded by the learned 
trial court , claimed that the deceased had received the phone call as made by the 
appellant and his co-accused on his mobile phone device , after the receiving of 
which phone call , not only the deceased but also the prosecution witnesses namely 
Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6) proceeded to the place of 
occurrence but both prosecution witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and 
Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6) were confronted with the improvement made by them 
with regard to the reason for their departure to the place of occurrence and the 

Murder Reference No.11 of  2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 953-J of 2018

learned trial court observed during the recording of the statement of Barkhurdar 
(PW-5) as under:- 
“ I had got written in Ex.PC that accused Shahid alias Shara and Khizar Hayyat 
called my brother through cell phone. Confronted to Ex.PC where there is no 
mention of cell phone” (emphasis supplied). 
The learned trial court also noted that the prosecution witness namely Muhammad 
Iqbal (PW-6) also improved his previous statement so as to claim that it was 
indeed after receiving of the phone call by Muhammad Ramzan (deceased), the 
deceased proceeded to the place of occurrence and during the cross-examination of 
Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6) , the learned trial court observed as under:- 
“ I had got written in my statement u/s 161 Cr. P.C that accused Khizar Hayyat 
had telephonically called and summoned my deceased brother. Confronted to 
Ex.DA where it is not so recorded.”  (emphasis supplied). 
During the cross-examination not only was this fact that the receiving of call by the 
deceased on his mobile phone before his departure from his house was not 
mentioned either in the written application (Exh. PC) or the statement under 
section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Exh. DA) of Muhammad 
Iqbal (PW-6), it was also admitted by prosecution witnesses namely Barkhurdar 
(PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6) that the said mobile phone device under the 
use of deceased and the mobile phone device upon which he had allegedly received 
a call from the appellant and his co-accused, was not taken into possession by the 
Investigating Officer of the case. Barkhurdar (PW-5) during cross-examination, 
admitted as under:- 

Murder Reference No.11 of  2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 953-J of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 1154 of 2018

“ We produced the cell phone of my deceased brother to the I0 however, he did 
not take the same into his possession.” 
Zahid Mahmood, Inspector (PW-9), the Investigating Officer of the case, who 
arrived at the place of occurrence, denied the claim of the prosecution witness 
namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) that the mobile phone device on which the deceased 
had received a call from the appellant had been handed over to him rather stated 
that the said mobile phone device was never ever produced before him. Zahid 
Mahmood, Inspector (PW-9), the Investigating Officer of the case, during cross-
examination, stated as under:- 
“ In order to confirm the factum of telephone call by the accused to the deceased. 
I did not take the cell phone of deceased into my possession because the same 
was not produced by the complainant or Pws to me”(emphasis supplied). 
It is also a fact that the prosecution witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and 
Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6)  during the investigation of the case and even before the 
learned trial court did not produce any evidence in the shape of Call Data Record 
(C.D.R.) of the mobile phone number under the use of  Muhammad Ramzan  
(deceased) to establish that he had indeed received the telephonic call of the 
appellant and after receiving the said call the deceased and the prosecution 
witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6)  had 
proceeded to the place of occurrence. Furthermore, Zahid Mahmood, Inspector 
(PW-9), the Investigating Officer of the case and Qamar Zia, SI (PW-8), the other 
Investigating Officer of the case, also did not collect any evidence during the 
investigation of the case so as to prove that Muhammad Ramzan (deceased) had 
indeed received a phone call of the appellant. The mobile phone device on which 
the deceased had received the call after which he proceeded to the place of 

Murder Reference No.11 of  2019

12 
 
occurrence was also not found present at the place of occurrence by the 
Investigating Officer of the case, despite his presence at the place of occurrence for 
a continued period nor was produced by any witness during the investigation of the 
case nor was produced before the learned trial court. The Medical Officer who 
conducted the post-mortem examination of the dead body of the deceased also did 
not find any such mobile phone device at the time when he conducted the post-
mortem examination. The prosecution witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and 
Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6) were also confronted with the improvements made by 
them in their previous statements regarding that at what place the deceased had 
been asked to come. During the cross examination of Barkhurdar (PW-5), the 
learned trial court observed as under:- 
“I had got written in Ex.PC that the accused persons had called my brother 
Ramzan in their land i.e. the place of occurrence. Confronted to Ex.PC where 
there is no mention of any land or place of occurrence.” 
The failure of the prosecution to produce the mobile phone device under the use of 
Muhammad Ramzan (deceased) either during the investigation of the case or 
before the learned trial court has repercussions. The very inception of the 
prosecution case is put in doubt and the claimed reason of the prosecution 
witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6) to proceed to 
the place of occurrence has been proved to be a false reason due to the said failure 
of the prosecution to prove the claim of a call being received by the deceased on 
his mobile phone device before his departure to the place of occurrence. 
14.     We have also noted with grave concern that the narrative of the prosecution 
witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6)  that they and 
the deceased proceeded to meet the accused on their calling in the middle of the 

Murder Reference No.11 of  2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 953-J of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 1154 of 2018 
 
13 
 
night, at about 12.15 a.m (night), is opposed to natural human conduct and 
therefore not believable. In this regard, it has been observed that according to the 
prosecution witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6), 
an altercation had taken place between the accused and the deceased at 08.15 p.m. 
and after this altercation at 08.15 p.m, the deceased as well as the prosecution 
witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6) proceeded to 
the land of the accused. The prosecution witness namely Barkhurdar (PW-5), 
during cross-examination, stated as under:- 
“ There was an altercation between my deceased brother Ramzan and the accused 
persons at 08:00 PM prior to the occurrence, however, we were not present at that 
time. Anyhow my deceased brother Ramzan told me and my brother Muhammad 
Iqbal PW at home at 08:15 P.M.” 
The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6), admitted during cross-
examination as under:- 
“ The hot words were exchanged between the accused Fayyaz and deceased at 
about 08/09:00 P.M. When deceased Ramzan went to the accused persons at 
12:15 A.M, he disclosed to us that he had exchanged hot words with accused 
Fayyaz. We did not forbid our deceased brother from going out to the accused. 
Soon after the departure of the deceased, we started to chase him” 
Realizing this inherent flaw in their statements that if there had been an altercation 
between the accused and the deceased at 08.15 p.m then normally the deceased 
would not have gone running to meet the accused at 12.15 a.m (night), the 
prosecution witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6) 
came up with a claim that the deceased had proceeded to meet the accused in order 
to settle the matter, however, remained unable to explain as to why the matter was 

Murder Reference No.11 of  2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 953-J of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 1154 of 2018 
 
14 
 
to be settled in the middle of the night and that too in the middle of a field of 
sugarcane and not at the house of any of the accused. The prosecution witness 
namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) admitted during cross-examination as under:- 
“ At 08:00 P.M when my deceased brother disclosed the fact of altercation with 
the accused persons to me, we did not go to them in order to reconcile” 
Such behaviour, on the part of the deceased and the prosecution witnesses namely 
Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6)  as deposed by the prosecution 
witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6) runs counter 
to natural human conduct and behaviour. Article 129 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat 
Order, 1984 allows the courts to presume the existence of any fact, which it thinks 
likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events 
and human conduct in relation to the facts of the particular case. Reliance in this 
regard is placed on the case of  Khuda-E-Dad Alias Pehlwan Versus The State 
(2017 S C M R 701). We thus trust the existence of this fact, by virtue of the 
Article 129 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, that the conduct of the deceased 
and the prosecution witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal 
(PW-6) was opposed to the common course of natural events and human conduct 
and it was not possible at all that the deceased and the prosecution witnesses 
namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6) would have proceeded 
to the land of the same accused and that too in the middle of the night with whom 
the deceased had an altercation just four hours before. In this manner, we have 
come to an irresistible conclusion that the prosecution witnesses namely 
Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6) were not present at the place of 
occurrence and had not even witnessed the same.

15. 
 Another aspect of the case noted by us with some gravity is the fact that 
both the prosecution witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal 
(PW-6) admitted that the occurrence took place in the middle of a field at about 
12.15 a.m (night) and it was dark at the time of occurrence, still none of the 
witnesses stated in their statements before the learned trial court that any source of 
light was present and lit at the place of occurrence, at the time of occurrence, 
which allowed the witnesses to observe the occurrence. During the course of the 
investigation and even before the learned trial court, no source of light was ever 
produced in the light of which the prosecution witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-
5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6)  had witnessed the occurrence. Moreover, the 
prosecution witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6) 
candidly admitted that it was dark at the time of occurrence, however, made no 
effort to state that they had any source of light with them or that any source of light 
was available at the place of occurrence in the light of which they had seen the 
occurrence. The learned Additional Prosecutor General has rightly submitted that 
in the written application (Exh.PC) as submitted by Barkhurdar (PW-5) for the 
registration of the case, it had been mentioned that Barkhurdar (PW-5) had with 
him an electric torchlight, however, has also admitted that when the prosecution 
witness namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) got recorded his statement before the learned 
trial court, he did not claim that he was having with him an electric torchlight or 
that he had used the said electric torchlight for enabling him to witness the 
occurrence. When Barkhurdar (PW-5) himself never stated in his statement before 
the learned trial court that he was having with him an electric torchlight, we cannot 
presume the said fact on our own. Moreover, it is an admitted part of the 
prosecution case that no source of any light was produced either before the

Investigating Officer of the case or before the learned trial court, in the light of 
which source the prosecution witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and 
Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6) had witnessed the occurrence. It is also a fact admitted 
by the prosecution witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal 
(PW-6) that they were at a distance of as much as 15 feet when the occurrence took 
place and the ability of the prosecution witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and 
Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6)  who have minutely witnessed the occurrence in such 
darkness was not proved. The prosecution witness namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) 
during cross-examination stated as under:- 
“We had witnessed the occurrence from the distance of 14/15 feet. We had told the I.O 
that we had witnessed the occurrence from the distance of 14/15 feet. ” (emphasis 
supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6) during cross-
examination stated as under:- 
“We both were at a distance of sixteen feet from the place of occurrence ” 
Moreover, Zahid Mahmood, Inspector (PW-9), the Investigating Officer of the 
case, also admitted the absence of any light source at the place of occurrence. 
Zahid Mahmood, Inspector (PW-9) during cross-examination admitted as under:- 
“ I carried out all the proceedings at the spot in the light of official vehicle. The 
place of occurrence was a field in cultivation and had crop of millet and 
sugarcane.” 
The non-production of any light source, available and lit at the place of occurrence, 
at the time of occurrence and the failure of the complainant of the case as well as 
the Investigating Officer of the case to produce the same before the learned trial 
court leads to only one conclusion and that being that no such source of light was 
available with the witnesses or available at the place of occurrence which could 

Murder Reference No.11 of  2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 953-J of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 1154 of 2018 
 
17 
 
have enabled the eye witnesses to have identified the assailant and also spectate the 
role of the assailant as acted by him during the occurrence. The prosecution 
witnesses failed to establish the fact of availability of any light source at the place 
of occurrence, at the time of occurrence and in the absence of their ability to do so, 
we cannot presume the existence of such a light source. The absence of any light 
source has put the whole prosecution case in the murk. It was admitted by the 
witnesses themselves that it was a dark night and as the prosecution witnesses 
failed to prove the availability of any light source, their statements with regard to 
them identifying the assailant cannot be relied upon. The failure of the prosecution 
witnesses to prove the presence of any light source at the place of occurrence, at 
the time of occurrence, has repercussions, entailing the failure of the prosecution 
case. Reliance is placed on the case of “Gulfam and another v. The State” (2017 
SCMR 1189) wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan observed as under:- 
“The occurrence in this case had taken place at about 11.45 p.m. during the 
fateful night and the source of light at the spot had never been established by the 
prosecution. It had been presumed by the courts below that as the occurrence had 
taken place at a medical store, therefore, some electric light must be available at 
the spot. The courts below ought to have realized that presumptions have very 
little scope in a criminal case unless such presumption is allowed by the law to be 
raised” 
Reliance is also placed on the case of “Hameed Gul v. Tahir and two others” 
(2006 SCMR 1628) wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan observed as 
under:- 
“Next is the identification of the accused on the spot. The torch in the 
light of which the accused were identified, was produced before the 
Investigating Officer sixteen days after the occurrence. The one Haid 
Akbar who produced the same before he Investigating Officer was never 
produced at the trial and hence there is no satisfactory evidence that the 
torch produced in the given circumstances was the same, available at 
the time of occurrence. It was never found on the spot along with other 
recoveries though there was no occasion for the injured and the 
deceased to have carried it along.”

Criminal Appeal    No. 953-J of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 1154 of 2018 
 
18 
 
Reliance is  also placed on the case of “Basar Vs. Zulfiqar Ali and others” (2010 
SCMR 1972) wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan observed as under:- 
“7. It is also alleged by the prosecution that the witnesses had identified 
the culprits on torch lights. The complainant and P.Ws. did not produce 
the torches before the police immediately but the same were produced 
after 10 days of the incident. 
8. Considering all aspects of the case, we are of the view that the 
prosecution has failed to prove the case against the respondents beyond 
any reasonable doubt.” 
Reliance is also placed on the case of “Azhar Mehmood and others v. The State” 
(2017 SCMR 135) wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan observed as 
under:- 
“It has straightaway been noticed by us that the occurrence in this case 
had taken place after dark and in the FIR no source of light at the spot 
had been mentioned by the complainant. Although in the site-plan of the 
place of occurrence availability of an electric bulb near the spot had 
been shown yet no such bulb had been secured by the investigating 
officer during the investigation of this case.” 
Reliance is also placed on the case of “Arshad Khan v. The State” (2017 SCMR 
564) wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan observed as under:- 
“The occurrence in this case had taken place before Fajar prayers at 
about 05.00 a.m. and according to the FIR the occurrence in issue had 
been witnessed by the eye-witness in the light of an electric bulb but 
during the investigation no such electric bulb had been secured by the 
investigating officer.” 
16. 
  We have also noted that both the prosecution witnesses namely Barkhurdar 
(PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6) were not mentioned either in column No.4 
of the inquest report (Exh.PK) as being the witnesses who had identified the dead 
body of the deceased at the time of preparation of the inquest report (Exh.PK)  nor 
were mentioned at page 4 of the inquest report (Exh.PK) as witnesses who were 
present at the place of occurrence at the time of preparation of the inquest report 
(Exh.PK). Zahid Mahmood, Inspector (PW-9), the Investigating Officer of the 
case, stated during cross-examination that he had prepared the inquest report 
(Exh.PK) at the place of occurrence as the dead body was present there when he 

Murder Reference No.11 of  2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 953-J of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 1154 of 2018 
 
19 
 
arrived at the spot. Zahid Mahmood, Inspector (PW-9), the Investigating Officer of 
the case, stated during cross-examination as under:- 
“I received information regarding occurrence at 01:30 a.m (night) and reached at 
the spot at 02:30 am (night). There were 08/10-persons men and women, present 
at the place of occurrence. The dead body was lying on the same place where 
the deceased was done to death ” (emphasis supplied)  
This fact also point towards the absence of the prosecution witnesses namely 
Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6) at the place of occurrence, at the 
time of preparation of the inquest report (Exh.PK) by Zahid Mahmood, Inspector 
(PW-9), the Investigating Officer of the case. We have also noted that the 
prosecution witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6) 
claimed that their clothes were smeared with the  blood of the deceased ,however 
at the same time also admitted that they did not hand over the said clothes to the 
Investigating Officer of the case.  Barkhurdar (PW-5), during cross-examination, 
stated as under: - 
“The clothes of my brother Iqbal were blood stained. We did not produce 
the blood stained clothes of the PW Iqbal to the I.O.”(emphasis supplied)  
Zahid Mahmood, Inspector (PW-9), the Investigating Officer of the case, did not 
take any such blood-stained clothes of the prosecution witness namely Muhammad 
Iqbal (PW-6)  in possession during the investigation of the case, however, if Zahid 
Mahmood, Inspector (PW-9), the Investigating Officer of the case had taken the 
clothes of prosecution witness namely Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6), which clothes 
according to the prosecution witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and 
Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6)  were stained with blood, into possession and if these 
were sent to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore for examination and 

Murder Reference No.11 of  2019

20 
 
grouping with that of the blood-stained clothes of the deceased, the same would 
have provided the strongest corroboration to the testimony of the prosecution 
witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6), but now the 
omission creates doubt of equal magnitude. Guidance is sought from the principle 
enunciated by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Mst. SUGHRA 
BEGUM and another versus QAISER PERVEZ and others (2015 S C M R 1142) 
and in the case of Mst. MIR ZALAI versus GHAZI KHAN and others (2020 S C M 
R 319) and in the case of NADEEM alias KALA versus The State and others (2018 
S C M R 153).   
 17. 
  We have also noted with disquiet that the postmortem examination of the 
dead body of the deceased was conducted with much delay. According to the Post 
Mortem Examination Report (Exh.PH) as well as the statement of  Dr. Muhammad 
Asif Imam (PW-7) , the post mortem examination of the dead body of the deceased 
namely Muhammad Ramzan son of Noor Muhammad was conducted at 08.00 
a.m. on 20.08.2016. Furthermore, according to the Post Mortem Examination 
Report (Exh.PH) as well as the statement of Dr. Muhammad Asif Imam (PW-7), 
the police papers were received at 07.30 a.m on 20.08.2016 and thereafter the post 
mortem examination of the dead body of the deceased was conducted. Dr. 
Muhammad Asif Imam (PW-7) explained during cross-examination as under:- 
“ It is correct that I did not receive the police documents at 07:30 A.M on 
20.08.2016. I cannot tell the name of the person from our staff who received the 
police papers. I received the police papers at 07:30 A.M.  
……….. 
I did not start the postmortem because the police papers were not given to me 
with the dead body” (emphasis supplied)

Criminal Appeal    No. 953-J of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 1154 of 2018 
 
21 
 
The perusal of the Post Mortem Examination Report (Exh.PH) as well as the 
statement of   Dr. Muhammad Asif Imam (PW-7) clearly establishes the fact the 
post mortem examination of the dead body of the deceased was delayed and the 
delay was due to the late submission of police papers. No explanation was offered 
to justify the said delay in conducting the post mortem examination. This clearly 
establishes that the witnesses claiming to have seen the occurrence were not 
present at the time of occurrence and the delay in the post mortem examination 
was used to procure their attendance and formulate a false narrative after 
consultation and concert. It has been repeatedly held by the august Supreme Court 
of Pakistan that such delay in the post mortem examination is reflective of the 
absence of witnesses and the sole purpose of causing such delay is to procure the 
presence of witnesses and to further advance a false narrative to involve any 
person. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Khalid alias Khalidi 
and two others vs. The State” (2012 SCMR 327) has held as under: 
“The incident in the instant case took place at 2.00 a.m, FIR was recorded at 4/5 
a.m, Doctor Muhammad Pervaiz medically examined the injured person at 4.00 
a.m. but conducted the post mortem examination of the deceased at 3.00 p.m i.e. 
after about ten hours, which fact clearly shows that the FIR was not lodged at the 
given time”. 
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Mian SOHAIL AHMED and 
others vs. The State and others” (2019 SCMR 956) has held as under: 
“According to the Doctor (PW-10), who did the post-mortem examination, the 
dead-body of the deceased was brought to the mortuary at 11:15 a.m. on 
01.9.2006 and the post-mortem examination took place at 12 noon after a delay of 
15 hours. This delay in the post-mortem examination, when the occurrence was 
promptly reported at 8:45 p.m. and formal FIR was registered at 9.00 p.m. on 
31.8.2006 gives rise to an inference that the incident was not reported as stated 
by the prosecution” 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “MUHAMMAD RAFIQUE 
alias FEEQA vs. The State” (2019 SCMR 1068) has held as under: 

Murder Reference No.11 of  2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 953-J of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 1154 of 2018 
 
22 
 
“More importantly, the only person who can medically examine the dead body 
during the said police custody of the dead body is the medical officer, and that 
too, when the same is handed over to him by the police for its examination. For 
the purposes of the present case, it is crucial to note that, at the time of handing 
over a dead body by the police to the medical officer, all reports prepared by the 
investigating officer are also to be handed over in order to assist in the 
examination of the dead body. 
10. 
Thus, once there is suspicion regarding the death of a person, the 
following essential steps follow: firstly, there is a complete chain of police 
custody of the dead body, right from the moment it is taken into custody until it is 
handed over to the relatives, or in case they are unknown, then till his burial; 
secondly, post mortem examination of a dead person cannot be carried out 
without the authorization of competent police officer or the magistrate; thirdly, 
post mortem of a deceased person can only be carried out by a notified 
government Medical Officer; and finally, at the time of handing over the dead 
body by the police to the Medical Officer, all reports prepared by the 
investigating officer are also to be handed over to the said medical officer to 
assist his examination of the dead body. 
11. 
It is usually the delay in the preparation of these police reports, which 
are required to be handed over to the medical officer along with the dead body, 
that result in the consequential delay of the post mortem examination of the 
dead person. To repel any adverse inference for such a delay, the prosecution has 
to provide justifiable reasons therefor, which in the present case is strikingly 
wanting.”  
 
18. 
The learned Additional Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the 
complainant have stressed that for the fact that Barkhurdar (PW-5) had submitted 
the written application (Exh. PC) for the registration of the case on 20.08.2016 at 
about 01.30 a.m., when the occurrence had taken place on 20.08.2016 at about 
12.15 a.m, therefore, the promptitude in reporting the matter to the police also 
offered support of the prosecution case.  A perusal of the statements of the 
witnesses produced by the prosecution during the course of trial reveals that  they 
made contradictory and mutually destructive statements regarding the registration 
of the F.I.R and the arrival of the police at the place of occurrence. According to 
the prosecution witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-
6) , after the occurrence , the deceased was taken in an injured condition on a car to 
RHC Talumba where he was pronounced dead and thereafter the prosecution 
witness namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) proceeded to the Police Station and submitted 

Murder Reference No.11 of  2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 953-J of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 1154 of 2018 
 
23 
 
the written application (Exh.PC) at the Police Station for the registration for the 
formal F.I.R. The prosecution witness namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) claimed in his 
statement before the learned trial court , as under:- 
“We took Muhammad Ramzan in an injured condition at RHC Talumba where he 
succumbed to the aforesaid injuries. 
………… 
Within the 5/7 minutes we picked the deceased form (sic)  the spot and took him 
to R.H.C. Tulamba. We took the deceased on the car of Shabbir Wattoo r/o chak 
No.21/8R. Fortunately Shabbir Wattoo came there on his vehicle who stopped 
there and subsequently took us to the hospital . 
………… 
Ex.PC had got written at R.H.C. Tulamba at about 01:15 A.M. The application 
was preferred at police station at 01:30 AM”  
A similar statement was made by the prosecution witness namely Muhammad 
Iqbal (PW-6) , however, Zahid Mahmood, Inspector (PW-9), the Investigating 
Officer of the case, stated during cross-examination that he received the 
information regarding the occurrence at 01.30 a.m and reached at the place of 
occurrence at 02.30 a.m and still the dead body was available at the place of 
occurrence at the same place where the deceased  had received the injuries and it 
was him who then sent the dead body of the deceased to the RHC for post mortem 
examination at about 03.30 a.m. Zahid Mahmood, Inspector (PW-9), the 
Investigating Officer of the case, stated during cross-examination as under:- 
“I received information regarding occurrence at 01:30 a.m (night) and reached at 
the spot at 02:30 am (night). There were 08/10-persons men and women, present 

Murder Reference No.11 of  2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 953-J of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 1154 of 2018 
 
24 
 
at the place of occurrence. The dead body was lying on the same place where 
the deceased was done to death. I remained at the place of occurrence for about 
02:00/02:30 hours (night). The dead body was shifted to mortuary on private 
van arranged by complainant at about 03:30 am (night). The dead body was 
escorted by Khalid constable and Munir etc. ” (emphasis supplied)  
The above referred portion of the cross-examination of Zahid Mahmood, Inspector 
(PW-9), the Investigating Officer of the case, clearly proves that neither the written 
application (Exh.PC) was submitted at the Police Station at the time as claimed by 
the prosecution witness namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) nor the prosecution witnesses 
namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6) knew about the 
presence of the dead body at the place of occurrence till 03.30 a.m. This absence of 
knowledge of the prosecution witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and 
Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6) that the dead body was available at the place of 
occurrence till 03.30 a.m. is in itself sufficient to prove that the prosecution 
witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6) were not 
present at the place of occurrence, at the time of occurrence. The scrutiny of the 
statements of the prosecution witnesses reveals that written application (Exh. PC)  
was a contrived, manufactured and compromised document. No corroboration of 
the prosecution evidence can be had from the said written application (Exh. PC). 
Sufficient doubts have arisen and inference against the prosecution has to be drawn 
in this regard. 
19. 
The learned Additional Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the 
complainant have also relied upon the recovery of the Pistol (P-3, mentioned as P-
1 in the statement of PW-6)  from the appellant namely Shahid alias Shahra and 
have submitted that the said recovery from the appellant offered sufficient 

Murder Reference No.11 of  2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 953-J of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 1154 of 2018 
 
25 
 
corroboration of the ocular account of the occurrence as furnished by the 
prosecution witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-
6).The recovery of the Pistol (P-3, mentioned as P-1 in the statement of PW-6)  
from the appellant namely Shahid alias Shahra cannot be relied upon as the 
Investigating Officer of the case did not join any witness of the locality during the 
recovery of the Pistol (P-3, mentioned as P-1 in the statement of PW-6)  from the 
appellant namely Shahid alias Shahra,  which action of his was in clear violation of 
the provisions of the section 103 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. Qamar Zia, 
SI (PW-8) admitted during cross-examination as under:- 
“I did not join into recovery proceedings any respectable of the vicinity ” 
The provisions of section 103 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 , unfortunately, 
are honoured more in disuse than compliance. To appreciate it better, this 
section is being reproduced:- 
"103.--(1) Before making a search. under this chapter, the officer or 
other person about to make it shall call upon two or more respectable 
inhabitants of the locality in which the place to be searched is 
situate to attend and witness the search and may issue an order in 
writing to them or any of them so to do.” 
Therefore the evidence of the recovery of the Pistol (P-3, mentioned as P-1 in the 
statement of PW-6)  from the appellant namely Shahid alias Shahra cannot be used 
as incriminating evidence against the appellant, being evidence which was 
obtained through illegal means and hence hit by the exclusionary rule of evidence. 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Muhammad Ismail and others 
Vs. The State(2017 SCMR 898) at page 901 has held as under:- 
“For the above mentioned recovery of weapons the prosecution had failed to 
associate any independent witness of the locality and, thus, the mandatory 

Murder Reference No.11 of  2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 953-J of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 1154 of 2018 
 
26 
 
provisions of section 103, Cr.P.C. had flagrantly been violated in that 
regard.” 
Moreover, the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6), admitted 
during cross-examination that the Pistol (P-3, mentioned as P-1 in the statement of 
PW-6) was recovered from the room of a house which was accessible to all. 
Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6), during cross-examination , stated as under:- 
“ All the accused persons namely Shahid alias Shara, Shah Muhammad and 
Ramzan are living in one and the same house. 
………… 
We also entered the said house with police. Their house was consisting of three 
rooms. The doors of those rooms open towards East. The recovery was effected 
from the room which situated towards Northern side of the rooms. The said room 
was open. The box from which the recovery was effected was locked. The key of 
the said box was given to the I.O by the mother of the accused.” 
 
In this manner, the prosecution witnesses failed to prove the exclusive possession 
of the appellant regarding the recovered Pistol (P-3, mentioned as P-1 in the 
statement of PW-6) .In this manner, the recovery of the Pistol (P-3, mentioned as 
P-1 in the statement of PW-6) from the appellant namely Shahid alias Shahra could 
not be proved and cannot be considered as a relevant fact for proving any fact in 
issue. Even otherwise, as we have disbelieved the ocular account in this case, 
hence, the evidence of recovery of the Pistol (P-3, mentioned as P-1 in the 
statement of PW-6) would have no consequence. It is an admitted rule of 
appreciation of evidence that recovery is only a corroborative piece of evidence 
and if the ocular account is found to be unreliable, then the recovery has no 
evidentiary value.

20. 
The learned Additional Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the 
complainant have also relied upon the evidence of motive and submitted that it 
corroborated the ocular account. The motive of the occurrence as stated by the 
prosecution witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6) 
was that the appellant used to bring women of ill repute near the house of the 
deceased and the deceased restrained him which then motivated the appellant to 
commit the occurrence. A perusal of the statements of the prosecution witnesses 
namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-6) reveals that they failed 
to prove the motive of the occurrence as narrated by them in their statements 
before the learned trial court. The prosecution witness namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) 
was exposed to having made dishonest improvements in his previous statement 
regarding the motive and the learned trial court observed during cross-examination 
as under:- 
“ I had got written in Ex.PC that Shahid alias Shara and Khizar Hayyat accused 
persons used to bring the women of bad character near our house on the cots. 
Confronted to Ex.PC where it is not mentioned that Shahid alias Shara and 
Khizar Hayyat accused used to bring women of bad character near our 
house on cots rather it is mentioned in Ex.PC that slut women and men were 
the visitors of the accused persons. I had got written in Ex.PC that my deceased 
brother Ramzan used to forbid the accused persons to bring the women of sluttish 
character. Confronted to Ex.PC where it is written that we forbid the accused 
persons for bringing the women of bad character and there is no mention of 
forbidding the accused by the deceased” (emphasis supplied)  
 
Furthermore, the prosecution witness namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) also admitted 
during cross-examination that the act of the appellant of bringing women of ill 

Murder Reference No.11 of  2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 953-J of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 1154 of 2018 
 
28 
 
repute to the house of the deceased was never reported to the police and stated as 
under:- 
“We did not inform the police that accused bring the women of ill repute near our 
house ” 
The above referred portions of the statement of Barkhurdar (PW-5) clearly prove 
that the prosecution witnesses failed to provide evidence enabling us to determine 
the truthfulness of the motive alleged. The prosecution witnesses failed to prove 
the fact that the said motive was so compelling that it could have led the appellant 
to have committed the Qatl-i-Amd of the deceased. There is a haunting silence with 
regard to the minutiae of motive alleged. No independent witness was produced by 
the prosecution to prove the motive as alleged.  Moreover, it is an admitted rule of 
appreciation of evidence that motive is only corroborative piece of evidence and if 
the ocular account is found to be unreliable then motive alone cannot be made 
basis of conviction. Even otherwise a tainted piece of evidence cannot corroborate 
another tainted piece of evidence. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held 
in the case of Muhammad Javed v. The State (2016 SCMR 2021) as under: 
“The said related and chance witnesses had failed to receive any 
independent corroboration inasmuch as no independent proof of the 
motive set up by the prosecution had been brought on the record of the 
case.” 
 
21.     The only other piece of evidence left to be considered is the medical 
evidence with regard to the injuries observed on the dead body of the deceased by 
Dr. Muhammad Asif Imam (PW-7) but the same is of no assistance in this case as 
medical evidence by its nature and character, cannot recognize a culprit in case of 
an unobserved incidence. As all the other pieces of evidence relied upon by the 
prosecution in this case have been disbelieved and discarded by us, therefore, the

appellant’s conviction cannot be upheld on the basis of medical evidence alone. 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in its binding judgment titled “Hashim 
Qasim and another Vs. The State” (2017 SCMR 986) has enunciated the following 
principle of law:  
“The medical evidence is only confirmatory or of supporting nature and is 
never held to be corroboratory evidence, to identify the culprit.”   
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in its binding judgment titled “Naveed 
Asghar and two others Vs. The State” (P L D 2021 Supreme Court 600) has 
enunciated the following principle of law:  
“31. 
The prosecution has attempted to complete the chain of circumstantial 
evidence by medical evidence relating to the post mortem examinations of the 
deceased persons. This evidence proves only the factum that death of the 
deceased persons was caused by cutting their throats through some sharp edge 
weapon; it does in no way indicate who had cut their throats and with what 
particular weapon. Medical evidence is in the nature of supporting, 
confirmatory or explanatory of the direct or circumstantial evidence, and is 
not "corroborative evidence" in the sense the term is used in legal parlance for 
a piece of evidence that itself also has some probative force to connect the 
accused person with the commission of offence. Medical evidence by itself 
does not throw any light on the identity of the offender. Such evidence may 
confirm the available substantive evidence with regard to certain facts 
including seat of the injury, nature of the injury, cause of the death, kind of the 
weapon used in the occurrence, duration between the injuries and the death, 
and presence of an injured witness or the injured accused at the place of 
occurrence, but it does not connect the accused with the commission of the 
offence. It cannot constitute corroboration for proving involvement of the 
accused person in the commission of offence, as it does not establish the 
identity of the accused person.32 Therefore, the medical evidence is of little 
help to the prosecution for bringing home the guilt to the petitioners.” 
 
22. 
 
Considering all the above circumstances, we entertain serious doubt in 
our minds regarding the involvement of Shahid @ Shahra son of Jalal  (appellant) 
in the present case. It is a settled principle of law that for giving the benefit of the 
doubt it is not necessary that there should be so many circumstances rather, if only 
a single circumstance creating reasonable doubt in the mind of a prudent person is 
available, then such benefit is to be extended to an accused not as a matter of

concession but as of right. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of 
"Muhammad Mansha Vs. The State" (2018 SCMR 772) has enunciated the 
following principle: 
"Needless to mention that while giving the benefit of doubt to an accused it 
is not necessary that there should be many circumstances creating doubt. 
If there is a circumstance which creates reasonable doubt in a prudent 
mind about the guilt of the accused, then the accused would be entitled to 
the benefit of such doubt, not as a matter of grace and concession, but as a 
matter of right. It is based on the maxim, "it is better that ten guilty 
persons be acquitted rather than one innocent person be convicted". 
Reliance in this behalf can be made upon the cases of Tariq Pervez v. The 
State (1995 SCMR 1345), Ghulam Qadir and 2 others v. The State (2008 
SCMR 1221), Muhammad Akramv.The State (2009 SCMR 230) and 
Muhammad Zamanv.The State (2014 SCMR 749)." 
 
Reliance is also placed on the judgment of the august Supreme Court of Pakistan 
"Najaf Ali Shah Vs. the State" (2021 S C M R 736) in which it has been held as 
infra: 
"9. 
Mere heinousness of the offence if not proved to the hilt is not a 
ground to avail the majesty of the court to do complete justice. This is 
an established principle of law and equity that it is better that 100 
guilty persons should let off but one innocent person should not suffer. 
As the preeminent English jurist William Blackstone wrote, "Better that 
ten guilty persons escape, than that one innocent suffer." Benjamin 
Franklin, who was one of the leading figures of early American history, 
went further arguing "it is better a hundred guilty persons should 
escape than one innocent person should suffer." All the contradictions 
noted by the learned High Court are sufficient to cast a shadow of 
doubt on the prosecution's case, which entitles the petitioner to the 
right of benefit of the doubt. It is a well settled principle of law that for 
the accused to be afforded this right of the benefit of the doubt it is not 
necessary that there should be many circumstances creating 
uncertainty and if there is only one doubt, the benefit of the same must 
got to the petitioner. This Court in the case of Mst. Asia Bibi v. The 
State (PLD 2019 SC 64) while relying on the the earlier judgments of 
this Court has categorically held that "if a single circumstance creates 
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the apprehension of guilt of 
an accused, then he/she shall be entitled to such benefit not as a matter 
of grace and concession, but as of right. Reference in this regard may 
be made to the cases of Tariq Pervaiz v. The State (1998 SCMR 1345) 
and Ayub Masih v. The State (PLD 2002 SC 1048)." The same view was 
reiterated in Abdul Jabbar v. State (2010 SCMR 129) when this court 
observed that once a single loophole is observed in a case presented by 
the prosecution, such as conflict in the ocular account and medical 
evidence or presence of eye-witnesses being doubtful, the benefit of 
such loophole/lacuna in the prosecution's case automatically goes in 
favour of an accused.”

23.  
 For what has been discussed above, Criminal Appeal No.953-J of  2018 
lodged by Shahid @ Shahra son of Jalal (appellant) is allowed. The conviction and 
sentence of Shahid @ Shahra son of Jalal  (appellant) awarded by the learned trial 
court through the impugned judgment dated 06.11.2018 are hereby set-aside. 
Shahid @ Shahra son of Jalal (appellant) is ordered to be acquitted by extending 
him the benefit of doubt. The appellant namely Shahid @ Shahra son of Jalal  is in 
custody and he is directed to be released forthwith if not required in any other case.  
24.   The complainant of the case namely Barkhurdar filed Criminal Appeal 
No.1154 of 2018, assailing the acquittal of Khizar Hayat ,Shah Muhammad and 
Muhammad Fayyaz alias Kali (all since acquitted),  by the learned trial court.  We 
have observed that the learned trial court has rightly acquitted the said accused. 
The prosecution witnesses namely Barkhurdar (PW-5) and Muhammad Iqbal (PW-
6) not only failed to prove their own presence at the time of occurrence,at the place 
of the occurrence but also failed to establish the presence of the accused namely 
Khizar Hayat , Shah Muhammad and Muhammad Fayyaz alias Kali (all since 
acquitted) at the place of the occurence.  It is important to note that according to 
the established principle of the criminal administration of justice once an acquittal 
is recorded in favour of the accused facing criminal charge he  enjoys  double 
presumption  of innocence, therefore, the courts competent to interfere in the 
acquittal order should be slow in converting the same into conviction,  unless and  
until  the  said  order is  patently illegal, shocking, based on misreading  and  non-
reading  of  the record or perverse.  The said principle has been enunciated by the 
august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the judgment reported as “Ghulam Sikandar 
and another Versus Mamaraz Khan and Others” (P L D 1985 Supreme Court 11) 
wherein it has been held as under: 

Murder Reference No.11 of  2019 
Criminal Appeal    No. 953-J of 2018 
Criminal Appeal    No. 1154 of 2018

“The Court would not interfere with acquittal merely because on re-
appraisal of the evidence it comes to the conclusion different from that of 
the Court acquitting the accused provided both the conclusions are 
reasonably possible. If however. the conclusion reached by that Court was 
such that no reasonable person would conceivably reach the same and was 
impossible then this Court would interfere in exceptional cases on 
overwhelming proof resulting in conclusion and irresistible conclusion; and 
that too with a view only to avoid grave miscarriage of justice and for no 
other purpose. The important test visualised in these cases, in this behalf 
was that the finding sought to be interfered with, after scrutiny under the 
foregoing searching light, should be found wholly as artificial, shocking and 
ridiculous.” 
 Reliance is placed on the case of “Muhammad   Inayat   Versus   The   State” 
(1998   SCMR   1854) wherein it has been held as under: 
“The judgment of acquittal qua Muhammad Yousaf, Muhammad Sated and 
Muhammad Nawaz cannot, in the given situation, be termed as perverse or 
foolish inasmuch as the view having been taken by the High Court can 
possibly be taken for acquitting them in the peculiar facts and circumstances 
of this case. It cannot be said that the impugned judgment of the High Court 
acquitting Muhammad Yousaf and two others is fanciful, artificial, shocking 
or ridiculous. 1t is based on convincing reasons” 
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Mst. Sughran Begum and 
another Vs. Qaiser Pervaiz and others” (2015 SCMR 1142) has held as under: 
“On acquittal, an accused person earns twofold innocence particularly, in 
the case when there are concurrent findings to that effect by the trial Court 
and the Court of First Appeal (High Court), is the bedrock principle of 
justice. In a case of acquittal, the standard and principle of appreciation of 
evidence is entirely different from that in a case of conviction. Unless the 
concurrent findings of the two Courts below are found perverse, fanciful, 
arbitrary and are based on misreading and non-reading of material 
evidence causing miscarriage of justice, the Supreme Court would not 
lightly disturb the same because on reappraisal, another view might be 
possible therefore, sanctity is attached under the law to such concurrent 
findings in ordinary course.” 
 Pursuant to the discussion made and conclusions arrived at above, the Criminal 
Appeal No.1154 of 2018, lodged by the complainant of the case namely 
Barkhurdar assailing the acquittal of Khizar Hayat ,Shah Muhammad and

Muhammad Fayyaz alias Kali by the learned trial court from the charges is hereby 
dismissed. 
25.        Consequently, the Murder Reference No. 11 of 2019 is answered in 
Negative and the sentence of death awarded to Shahid @ Shahra son of Jalal , is 
Not Confirmed.
