J U D G M E N T 
 
Date of hearing:     11.05.2023.                                                     
Petitioner by: 
M/s Aurangzeb Mirza and Muhammad Irfan 
Hanjra, Advocates.                             
Respondents by: 
Barrister Hamza Amjad, Advocate.  
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.:- 
Through 
this 
constitutional 
petition, 
petitioner 
has 
assailed 
correspondence dated 05.10.2018, issued by respondent No.2 / 
Director Land Development-I, Lahore Development Authority 
(“LDA”), Lahore, whereby petitioner was advised to contact his 
vendors in order to recover the claimed compensation. Petitioner has 
also sought direction from this Court for respondent-LDA to grant 
exemption in his favour for the land acquired for development of 
Muhammad Ali Johar Town Scheme, Lahore (“Johar Town”). 
Petitioner is also seeking his entitlement of two plots of 05-Marlas 
each in the aforesaid scheme in terms of the land owned by him, close 
to the area wherefrom his land was acquired.  
2. 
Learned counsel for petitioner submits that petitioner is entitled 
for exemption of his acquired land and same was granted pursuant to 
order passed by the Commissioner, Lahore Division, Lahore, but 
subsequently the same has been given to some other person on the 
basis of an ex parte decree, which has already been set aside. He adds 
that respondent-LDA is under legal obligation to fulfill its duties with 
regard to exemption of any available plot of similar nature to the 

 
2 
Writ Petition No.12812 of 2019 
 
petitioner. He further submits that impugned actions of respondent-
LDA are unsustainable in the eye of law.  
3. 
On the other hand, learned Legal Advisor for respondent-LDA 
defends the impugned actions by contending that petitioner was in fact 
served a notice by respondent-LDA on 14.09.1999 intimating the 
cancellation of ownership of the petitioner, however, petitioner never 
turned up.  
4. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused. 
5. 
Record shows that petitioner purchased land measuring 01-
Kanal 11-Marla, situated in Village Niaz Baig through registered sale 
deed dated 13.01.1979 and mutation No.17371 in respect thereof was 
sanctioned on 21.03.1983 in favour of petitioner. Respondent-LDA 
acquired petitioner’s land for development of M.A. Johar Town 
Scheme and on 20.12.1995, petitioner filed application for grant of 
exemption with respondent-LDA against his acquired land. Award was 
made by respondent-LDA Land Acquisition Collector on 29.11.1995. 
Respondent-LDA claimed development charges amounting to Rs. 
44,468/- which were duly paid by the petitioner on 25.07.1998. 
Petitioner thereafter was waiting for the allocation of the plots which 
got approved for 2 plots of 105 Sq. Meters by the Directorate of 
Exemption on 01.10.1998. With regard to specific plot numbers, he 
came to know that the revenue authorities of LDA on the basis of an ex 
parte decree dated 21.07.1997 had cancelled the award in favor of the 
petitioner. Petitioner approached LDA authorities where the 
information of the ex parte decree was brought to his notice which was 
immediately challenged and the ex parte decree was got set aside by 
the Civil Court vide order dated 13.03.2000. By the orders of LDA, 
petitioner approached Commissioner, Lahore Division, Lahore, for 
correction of award and restoration of the name of the petitioner as an 
awardee, who after conducting proceedings as per law, restored the 
name of the petitioner as an awardee vide order dated 04.04.2015. 
However, instead of restoring the name of petitioner as awardee, 
exemption was granted to aforesaid decree-holders, who further sold 

 
3 
Writ Petition No.12812 of 2019 
 
the land to a third party. Subsequently, vide impugned order, 
petitioner’s request was declined on the strength of amendment 
brought in the year 2013 in Section 25-B(7) of the LDA Act, 1975, by 
observing that once the authority satisfies any claim of compensation 
in respect of a property, LDA will not entertain claim of any 
subsequent interested person, who will recover the compensation from 
the person who earlier received the compensation in respect of same 
property.  
6. 
The questions before this Court are: (i) Whether respondent-
LDA was not obliged to follow the principles of natural justice and 
ensure observance of minimum requirements of due process while 
deciding matter adversely against petitioner, especially when valid 
order regarding restoration of petitioner’s exemption was in filed? and 
(ii) Whether amendment in Section 25-B(7) of the LDA Act, 1975, 
brought in the year 2013, could have been applied retrospectively 
while deciding petitioner’s request? 
7. 
It is not discernible from record as to whether any notice was 
served upon petitioner or he was associated while conducting and 
finalizing exemption proceedings in favour of decree-holders of 
aforesaid ex parte decree, which was subsequently set aside. It is 
unimaginable that when the entire process of exemption was 
completed, how can the award be cancelled even without issuing any 
notice or affording any opportunity of hearing to the petitioner merely 
on the basis of an ex parte decree. Any order passed against an 
aggrieved person, without providing him / her proper hearing or giving 
any reasons, is unsustainable in the eye of law as the public 
functionaries are obliged to follow the principles of natural justice 
while deciding rights of the parties. Petitioner had paid the entire 
development charges as directed by LDA in year 1998, hence, the 
process of subsequent exemption in favour of another party could not 
have been finalized without associating the earlier exemptee. This 
Court, in view of special circumstances, has ample powers to give 
direction to public functionaries to act in accordance with law by virtue 

 
4 
Writ Petition No.12812 of 2019 
 
of Articles 4 & 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 and set aside order passed by the Authorities which is 
not valid in eye of law. Reliance is placed upon Muhammad Aslam v. 
Government of the Punjab, Service and General Administration, 
Punjab Civil Secretariat, Lahore through Secretary and 5 others [2003 
PLC (C.S) 433].   
8. 
Needless to emphasize that petitioner is entitled to due process, 
right to be treated fairly at all times, right to procedural fairness and 
right to procedural propriety. Petitioner, being a citizen of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, has the right to a fair procedure and it has been 
constitutionally guaranteed. In this regard, reliance is placed upon 
Pakistan Defence Officers Housing Authority v. Mrs. Itrat Sajjad Khan 
and others (2017 SCMR 2010).  
9. 
The legal position in respect of Sec 25-B(7) of LDA Act 1975 
does not support the case of LDA. This Act was passed as an Act 
XXVI of 2013 which in terms of judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme 
Court does not have any retrospective affect. It is by now a well settled 
law that an amendment in a section or its substitution which curtails 
substantive right or accrued right cannot itself have a retrospective 
operation unless the legislature elected to give it retrospective effect. 
Therefore, substituted or amended section of a statute cannot obliterate 
accrued or vested rights. In the instant case, as the section 25-B was 
added through an amendment in the year 2013 whereby substantive 
rights of the awardees were curtailed without giving it retrospective 
effect therefore this amendment cannot affect the accrued rights before 
the said amendment. Reliance is placed upon Zakaria H.A. Sattar 
Bilwani and another v. Inspecting Additional Commissioner of Wealth 
Tax, Range-II, Karachi (2003 SCMR 271), Mst. Sarwar Jan and 
others v. Mukhtar Ahmad and others (PLD 2012 Supreme Court 
217), Muhammad Tariq Badr and another v. National Bank of 
Pakistan and others (2013 SCMR 314), Badshah Gul Wazir v. 
Government Of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through Chief Secretary and 
others (2015 SCMR 43), Commissioner Inland Revenue v. Messrs 

 
5 
Writ Petition No.12812 of 2019 
 
Olympia Chemicals Ltd., Lahore (2021 PTD 1512), Islamabad 
Electric Supply Company Limited Through Additional Director 
General Legal v. National Electric Power Regulatory Authority and 
others (PLD 2021 Islamabad 221), Kashif Mahmood v. Additional 
District Judge and others (2022 MLD 1762) and The Commissioner 
Inland Revenue, Zone-II, Regional Tax Office, Lahore v. Shazia 
Zafar (2022 PTD 1942).  
 
In the case of Muhammad Tariq Badr supra, the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court has ruled as under:- 
“16. 
… Before further proceeding with the matter it may 
be mentioned that according to the settled law a change in 
the substantive law which divests and adversely affect the 
vested rights of the parties shall always have prospective 
application, unless by express word of the legislation and/or 
by necessary intendment/implication such law has been 
made applicable retrospectively. In other words the vested 
and substantive rights of the parties are and should be 
decided according to the law which was prevalent when the 
action was initiated and the door of the Court was knocked; 
and/or the machinery (of the Court) was set in motion.”  
 
 
Likewise, in the case of Badshah Gul Wazir supra, the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court has observed as under:- 
“10. 
… The learned Bench also erred in law by holding 
that, "a substituted section in an Act introduced by an 
amending Act is to be treated having retroactive operation as 
the function of a substituted section in an Act is to obliterate 
the rights of the parties as if they never existed." With 
respect to the learned judges the proposition formulated by 
them does not accord with the law and settled precedents. A 
substituted 
section, 
and 
particularly 
one 
curtailing 
substantive rights, does not have "retroactive operation" 
unless the legislature elects to give it retrospective effect. 
Nor does a substituted section obliterate accrued rights; 
section 6 and section 4 respectively of the Federal and 
Provincial General Clauses Act specifically preserves such 
vested rights as mentioned therein. The courts have 
interpreted laws and notifications in the light of the General 
Clause Acts to save rather than obliterate vested rights.”  
 
10. 
In view of the above, instant petition is allowed, impugned 
letter/correspondence is declared to be illegal and without lawful 
authority, thus, same is set aside. The matter is remitted to respondent 

 
6 
Writ Petition No.12812 of 2019 
 
No.2 with direction to redress petitioner’s grievance strictly in 
accordance with law, after appreciating the available record as well as 
applicable law and contentions of the petitioner, preferably within a 
period of thirty days from the receipt of certified copy of this 
judgment.
