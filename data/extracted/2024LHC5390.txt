ASIM HAFEEZ, J:- This and connected constitutional 
petitions, detailed in Schedule-A, appended and forms part of the 
judgment, are simply directed against the policy decision of the 
Provincial Government to out-source the running and management 
of Public schools under Public School Reorganization Program 
(PSRP). Further declaration is sought to declare this policy 
unlawful and unconstitutional, on the premise that it violates the 
constitutional guarantees extended under Article 25-A of the 

W.P.No. 7707/2024 
2
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973 (the 
‘Constitution, 1973’). 
2. 
Stand of the provincial government is that PSRP manifest 
continuation 
of 
the 
Public 
Private 
Partnership 
initiative, 
contemplated under the statutory framework of The Punjab 
Education Foundation Act, 2004 (Act of 2004). In terms of the Act 
of 2004, a Foundation was established with defined goals, 
objectives and targets, most crucial being promotion of education 
with support of private sector, ensuring that education is imparted 
to the poor masses – functions of the Foundation are listed in 
section 4 of the Act of 2004. Foundation comprises of Board of 
Directors, having combination of the representatives of the 
government and members possessing finesse and expertise in 
relevant fields, with diverse experience. A Fund was established 
which vests in the Foundation. It is apparent from the perusal of the 
Punjab Rules of Business 2011 that Foundation is under the 
allocation of School Education Department. Program is run, 
managed and regulated through the terms of reference, which 
prescribes mechanism for handing over of administration and 
management of underperforming Public Sector Schools to private 
service providers through the Foundation – in fact is the bridge 
between the Government and private sector. Program works in a 
manner that underperforming schools are identified – mechanism is 
provided under the terms of reference – and upon undertaking the 
process of scrutiny, management of public sector school is 
entrusted to a licensee under licensing arrangement – upon securing 
a school specific authorization. Terms of licensing arrangement are 
placed on record along report and para-wise comments. It is 
apprised that program is implemented in phases.  
 
3. 
Petitioners, comprised of disgruntled  parents, expressing 
grievance against entrustment of school(s) to licensee(s) under the 
arrangement. And other persons, whose interest and identity is not 
clearly disclosed in the petitions, also raise grievance against the 

W.P.No. 7707/2024 
3
policy. It is believed that petitioners are aggrieved of the 
implementation of the Program. It is argued on their behalf that 
public-private partnership initiative is inherently opposed to the 
concept / commitment of providing free education, obligated in 
terms of Article 25-A of the Constitution, 1973. It is further argued 
that no legislative instrument is available to support the Program or 
the policy. Further submits that statutory framework provided 
under the Act of 2004 does not support the decision to outsource 
the schools. Learned counsel vehemently argued that no 
mechanism is prescribed for selection of schools, recruitment of 
teachers and provisioning of infrastructure. Adds that no 
mechanism is available to assess the performance of the licensee(s), 
which are hand-picked blue-eyed of the Politicians. Main emphasis 
is on the plea that enforcement of Program would result in 
imposition / increase in the fee and charges, which is contrary to 
the principle of free education, an obligation of the State. 
 
4. 
Conversely, learned Law Officers and learned counsel 
representing the Foundation explained the features of the Program, 
mechanism prescribed for outsourcing, selection of eligible 
lessee(s) and strict monitoring regime. It is explained that there is 
no increase in the fee, which is one of the condition of the licensing 
arrangement and no document has been provided to show any raise 
in the fee, in any manner. Leaned counsel for the Foundation read 
out salient features of the terms of reference and conditions of the 
agreement – in particular clause 13 thereof. Adds that Foundation is 
alter ego of the Government and is under the oversight of the 
School Education Department. Submits that tasks performed by the 
Foundation are strictly in accord with the functions assigned under 
Act of 2004. Lastly, submits that government owns and stand by its 
commitment of ensuring compliance of the mandate of Article 25-
A of the Constitution, 1973.

On previous date, learned Law Officer was directed to 
provide approval of the cabinet for enforcement of the Program. 
Approval of the Cabinet is placed on record, wherein Agenda item 
45 is relevant, and discussion therein provides an illustrative insight 
in the functioning of the Program. Minutes of Agenda Item No.45 
are reproduced hereunder for reference:- 
 
“AGENDA ITEM NO.45 REQUEST FOR  APPROVAL OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
 
REORGANIZATION PROGRAM (PSRP) TO REVAMP 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOR PROVISION OF QUALITY 
EDUCATION. 
 
45.1 The Secretary School Education Department briefed the Cabinet that during a 
review meeting regarding the School Education Department (SED) held on 
04.04.2024, the Chief Minister Punjab had in principle approved that the operational 
management of low performing public schools with zero teacher, single teacher or 
two teachers may be outsourced to private service providers in order to enhance the 
access and quality of education. It was further decided that due to capacity 
constraints of PEIMA, Punjab Education Foundation (PEF) will spearhead this 
outsourcing campaign on the lines of erstwhile Public Schools Support Program 
(PSSP). 
 
45.2 The Cabinet was further apprised that there are 13,219 such schools with a total 
of 22,749 teachers, working against 56,175 sanctioned posts, and 1,089,961 enrolled 
students. The instant outsourcing program, titled as the Public Schools 
Reorganization Program (PSRP) has been designed to encourage educated youth, 
experienced individuals, expat Pakistanis, school chains, Ed-Tech firms and NGOs to 
join hands with the Government in reorganization and revamping of the public sector 
schools. Consultations were undertaken with the leading stakeholders and it was 
decided that the schools could be outsourced in three phases as follows: 
 
Phases 
Schools 
 
i. 
 
Handing over operational management of following 5,863 school: 
567 schools with zero teacher; 
2,555 schools with single teacher; 
2,741 schools with enrolment up to 50 students and two teachers. 
 
ii. 
Handing over operational management of 4,453 schools with 
enrollment from 51 to 100 students and two teachers 
iii. 
Handing over operational management of 2,903  school with more 
than 100 students and two teachers 
 
45.3 After exhaustive deliberations with the stakeholders and in the light of the 
comprehensive terms & conditions in vogue for erstwhile Public Schools Support 
Program, detailed TORs have been developed for PSRP, inducing eligibility criteria, 
evaluation criteria and clustering process. In order to ensure value for money, a 
performance evaluation system will also be put into place to assess the impact of this 
outsourcing on school performance, student enrollments and learning outcomes. This 
evaluation will be the yardstick for continuation of the outsourcing arrangements with 
the successful licensee. 
 
45.4 The anticipated savings from outsourcing of these schools have been worked out 
as under: 
 
 
Description 
PKR (Billion) 
Salaries against the sanctioned posts 56,175 
40.5 

W.P.No. 7707/2024 
5
NSB against the current enrolment (1,089,961) 
1.6 
Total Saving (Non- Development Budget) 
42.1 
Note: Pensionary Contribution is not included in the saving. 
 
 
45.5 In a follow-up review meeting held on, 15.05.2024, Chief Minister accorded 
approval for outsourcing in three phases in accordance with the timelines stated by 
the Department. The media campaign of PSRP was also approved with the directions 
of its immediate launch. 
45.6 Finance Department observed that the RE 2023-24 for School Education 
Department is Rs. 516.6 billion while the BE 2024-25 is Rs. 573.4 billion showing an 
increase of 10.99%. Most of the expenditure in School Education Department goes 
towards salaries of teachers and other employee related expenditures, while the 
quality of education imparted and performance of the sector remains below par. 
Therefore, gradual shifting towards outsourcing the management of public schools 
and gradually shedding off the 600,000+ HR of this department is the only financially 
sustainable way forward. Proposal at para-6/ante is endorsed with the observation 
that the actual short term savings would be just the Non-Salary Budget at Rs. 1.6 
billion but with each passing year as the work force of the department retires, savings 
in the Salary Budget would increase. The AD should divert the redundant HR from 
outsourced schools to other schools with high enrolment and low teacher count and 
the sanctioned posts not required should be conveyed to the Finance Department to 
be abolished. 
 
45.7 Accordingly, the Cabinet was requested to consider and approve the proposals 
mentioned in paras 45.2, 45.3, and 45.5 above read with para 45.6. 
DECISION No. 45: 
 
The Cabinet considered and approved the proposal as mentioned in para 45.7 
above.”                
  
7. 
After hearing the learned counsel, it appears that the critical 
issue is whether the Foundation is an autonomous body, 
independent of the regulatory control of the Government or an 
instrumentality to benefit private sector at the expense of depriving 
deserving children of fair opportunity. And whether the functions 
performed by the Foundation are in accord with the mandate of the 
law. There is no cavil that School Education Department is the 
secretariat department of the Government, to which business of the 
government is allocated / distributed, which allotment inter alia 
includes the task of promoting quality education through Public-
Private partnership through Punjab Education Foundation – clear 
instructions are contained in the Rules of Business. It is noted that 
Punjab Education Foundation was omitted from the list of 
Autonomous Bodies and brought under the regulatory control of 
the government department. It is in fact the policy of the 
department, which is being implemented under the statutory 
framework of address the Act of 2004. Section 13-A of the Act of 

W.P.No. 7707/2024 
6
2004 provides key to address the consternation / concern of the 
petitioners, which is reproduced hereunder,  
“13A. Direction of the Government.- In the performance of its 
functions, the Foundation shall be bound by and shall give effect to the 
directions of the Government.” 
 
8. 
Functionality of the Foundation is governed and regulated by 
the Government. Petitioners in fact are seeking exercise of judicial 
review jurisdiction in the functioning of the department, which 
intrusion in the absence of any illegality, voidness and perversity is 
unwarranted. No violation of any fundamental right is evident, 
when no direct evidence is available to substantiate allegation of 
fee raise or increase in education budget of the citizens. Learned 
counsel failed to convince this court that assumption and exercise 
of jurisdiction is imperative against policy decision of the 
government – outsourcing of the administration / management of 
underperforming schools and to deal with perennial problem of 
shortage of teachers. Argument of the petitioners that no law is 
available to back the policy of the government is misconceived. 
Policy introduced and Program implemented is in accordance with 
the mandate of provisions of Act of 2004. Policy had the approval 
of the cabinet. Neither any violation of constitutional guarantee is 
established nor violation of any provision of The Punjab Free and 
Compulsory Education Act 2014 is shown. In these circumstances, 
no case for exercising judicial review jurisdiction against the policy 
decision and Program is made out, which calls for showing 
deference 
to 
the 
policy-making 
domain 
of 
the 
Government/Executive. 
Policy 
decisions 
require 
political 
judgment, not legal interpretation.

This and connected petitions are devoid of merits and same 
are, hereby, dismissed.
