Lahore High Court, Lahore through Registrar 
 
J U D G M E N T 
 
Date of hearing:     
  22.06.2023. 
Appellant by: 
 Hafiz Tariq Nasim, Advocate. 
 
Respondent by: 
 Mr. Zubda-tul- Hassan, Advocate. 
  
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J. / MEMBER:- 
Through instant appeal, appellant has assailed vires of order 
dated 15.11.2021, passed by respondent, whereby appellant’s 
representation for grant of proforma promotion as Senior Civil 
Judge, was declined.  
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that appellant joined the 
District Judiciary as Civil Judge on 13.11.2000, however, his 
performance not being up to the mark adverse remakes were 
recorded in three Performance Evaluation Reports (“PERs”) 
for the period w.e.f 11.05.2009 to 31.12.2009, 02.05.2011 to 
31.12.2011 and 01.01.2012 to 26.04.2012 and the same were 
challenged through Service Appeals No.04 of 2013, 18 and 19 
of 2014 and during the pendency of titled appeals, appellant 
became eligible for promotion to the rank of Senior Civil Judge 
in December 2014, when the appellant’s promotion case was 
considered along with his juniors but the appellant was deferred 
and certain others were promoted vide order dated 15.12.2014. 
Again the appellant’s promotion case was considered in the 
year 2015 but deferred due to the pendency of Service Appeals 
before this Tribunal. The afore-referred appeals were decided 
by the Tribunal vide judgments dated 12.02.2016 directing that

for the period commencing from 27.04.2012 onwards, if there is 
no adverse entry in the PERs of the appellant for the next 3 
years, then the impugned remarks recorded in PERs will not 
stand in the way of consideration of appellant for further 
promotion. However, the appellant was promoted on 
06.12.2019 as Senior Civil Judge. Feeling aggrieved, appellant 
filed departmental appeal/representation for grant of proforma 
promotion but the same was rejected through order dated 
15.11.2021, hence this Service Appeal.  
3. 
Learned counsel for appellant submits that despite 
rendering 23 years of unblemished judicial service, appellant is 
being denied proforma promotion from the date when his 
juniors / batch mates were granted promotion, which is not only 
clear violation of applicable law, but same amounts to frustrate 
the fundamental rights of appellant. He has referred to The 
Province of the Punjab through the Secretary, Services and 
General Administration, Lahore v. Syed Muhammad Ashraf 
(1973 SCMR 304), Iftikharullah Malhi v. Chief Secretary and 
another (1998 SCMR 736) and Faiz Muhammad and another v. 
Member (Revenue), Board of Revenue, Punjab and 2 others 
[1984 PLC (C.S.) 1554]. He adds that appellant’s case was 
considered by the authority and deferred on account of some 
adverse remarks in PERs, however, after disposal of 
aforementioned appeals, the appellant was eligible for 
promotion to the rank of Senior Civil Judge w.e.f. 15.12.2014.  
4. 
Contrarily, learned Legal Advisor of respondent defends 
the impugned order. 
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused.  
6. 
Appellant is seeking proforma promotion as Senior Civil 
Judge w.e.f. 15.12.2014, when appellant was deferred and his 
juniors were promoted.    
7.  
Undeniably, temporary hurdle of adverse remarks in the 
PERs for periods in question remained no more as hurdle in the

way of appellant in the light of judgments dated 12.02.2016 
passed in Service Appeals No.04 of 2013, 18 and 19 of 2014. 
The operative part of the observations in Service Appeal No.19 
of 2014 is reproduced as under: - 
“4. 
In the sequel we accept the above noted request of the 
appellant’s counsel and accordingly direct that for the period commencing 
from 27.04.2012 onwards, if there is no adverse entry in the Performance 
Evaluation Reports during the next three years then the impugned 
remarks recorded in Performance Evaluation Report for the period from 
01.01.2012 to 26.09.2012 will not stand in the way of consideration of the 
appellant for further promotion.  
 
5.  
Disposed of.” 
 
                                                                                                                            
8.   
It is evidently clear that if PERs of next three years from 
27.04.2012 do not contain any adverse entry, the adverse 
remakes in PER in question would not be considered while 
taking up matter of appellant’s promotion. It is not denied that 
appellant possessed clear PERs for subsequent three years from 
27.04.2012, thus appellant is entitled to be granted proforma 
promotion from the date when his juniors were so promoted i.e. 
15.12.2014 as adverse entries in his previous PERs stood 
removed in the light of afore-referred decision of this Tribunal.  
9.  
Needless to say that proforma promotion means predating 
of promotion of a civil servant with effect from the date of 
promotion of his juniors for the purpose of payment of arrears 
and fixation of pay. It means that a civil servant who was 
entitled to be promoted from a particular date, but for no fault 
of his own, was wrongfully prevented from rendering service in 
the higher post, is entitled for proforma promotion and payment 
of arrears of pay/allowances and re-fixation of pay. The 
temporary embargo of adverse remarks was created against 
appellant’s right for such promotion and the said obstacle has 
been done away in the light of afore-referred judgment of this 
Tribunal, hence appellant’s monetary loss and loss of rank are 
liable to be remedied through proforma promotion. Reliance is

placed upon Arshad Ali v. WAPDA and others [2020 PLC 
(C.S.) 1226].  
10. 
In view of the above, instant appeal is allowed. 
Consequently, impugned order is set aside. We direct that 
appellant be considered for proforma promotion when his 
juniors were granted such promotion i.e. 15.12.2014.
