Mr. Imran Abbas Sahi, AAG. 
Mr. Asim Ali Gillani, Law Officer for 
respondent No.5. 
 
Through the instant petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the petitioner (accused of case 
FIR No.1089/2020 under sections 324, 337-F (iii), 337-F(v), 148, 149 
PPC, Police station Jinnah Road, Gujranwala), has questioned the vires of 
order dated 24.08.2022, whereby his application for setting-aside the 
report of medical board dated 29.07.2022 and re-examination through 
provincial medical board was dismissed by learned Judicial Magistrate 
Section 30, Gujranwala.  
2. 
It was told that with no sensory motor or planter reflexes Petitioner 
has been experiencing paralysis on the left side of his body which 
necessitated him to seek bail on medical grounds through Crl. Misc. No. 
65523-B of 2022 which is pending. However, through present writ 
petition he has thrown challenge to a report of Medical Superintendent 
DHQ Teaching Hospital, Gujranwala based on five members’ medical 
board dated 29.07.2022 whereby after examining the petitioner it was 
opined as under;  
“I am of the opinion that Mr. Sirrat Naeem is not suffering from Stroke/CVA” 
 
Earlier petitioner applied for bail on medical grounds before concerned 
Magistrate on whose direction a medical board was constituted and 
pursuant to report of medical board dated 29.07.2022, learned magistrate 
declined the bail vide order dated 30.07.2022. Petitioner then challenged 
the report of medical board dated 29.07.2022 before the said magistrate  
on multiple grounds but in short routes it as contrary to medical 

Writ Petition No.53882/2022.

investigation reports available on the record; learned Magistrate by virtue 
of order dated 24.08.2022 dismissed the application for constitution of 
another medical board on very sound reasons, which order has been 
assailed by the petitioner in any way through writ petition without any 
legal justification particularly when bail application of the petitioner is 
still pending and such grounds he can urge in those proceedings because 
bail is always considered to be a stage of inquiry. But as urged by learned 
counsel for the petitioner that the main issue would remain the report of 
medical board and direction be passed for constitution of a higher skilled 
medical board at Provincial level pursuant to three tiers mechanism 
introduced by the Punjab Government Health Department through 
revamping of medicolegal work in year 2003.  
3. 
Learned Assistant Advocate General submits that medicolegal work 
is entirely a different regime which is not applicable on the present subject 
and it is only discretionary with the court to seek as many reports as it 
desires if the earlier report is not satisfactory but present is not the case of 
that category, and even such request can be made while urging grounds 
for bail before the concerned court. Further states that pre-arrest bail of 
the petitioner was declined up to Supreme Court, now he is searching 
other ways to seek primarily a relief of bail and nothing else.   
4. 
Contentions heard; record was examined, and I have also gone 
through the relevant Prison Rules applicable on the subject.  
5.       Revamping of medicolegal work for three-tiers mechanism issued 
by Government of the Punjab Health Department delineates appellate 
authorities against the opinion of initial medicolegal officer (IMLO) 
which of course deals with medicolegal work and not the health condition 
of a prisoner. What is the medicolegal work has well explained through a 
research article published on 2 December 2021 Volume 2021:13 Pages 
521—526 in a Medical Journal “Open Access Emergency Medicine” 
published by Dovepress open access to scientific and medical research, on 
the topic “Characteristics of Medico-Legal Cases and Errors in Medico-Legal 
Reports at a Teaching Hospital in Saudi Arabia”. The expression is follows:- 

Writ Petition No.53882/2022.

A medico-legal case (MLC) applies to any case of injury or medical 
condition in which law enforcement agencies seek to investigate 
and fix the responsibility regarding the said injury or medical 
condition. From a physician’s perspective, a MLC is a medical or 
clinical case with legal implications. In such cases presented 
directly to the hospital, after obtaining a detailed history and 
examination of the patient, the physician concludes the need for the 
law enforcement administration to investigate further. Besides, such 
cases could also be referred to the physician by the law enforcement 
administration for application of medical expertise and opinion to 
aid in the administration of justice.  
 
Several MLCs presented to the emergency medicine department 
include accidents, criminal or self-inflicted injuries such as fights or 
physical assault and battery, poisonings, road traffic accidents, 
burns, falls, bites, and others. In an MLC, the hospital medical 
record pertaining to the case and the medico-legal report (MLR) 
furnished by the physician are vital. An MLR is a report drafted by 
a physician for legal proceedings. It is considered to be the written 
evidence of the physician who has examined the case and 
documented the findings. In many countries like Saudi Arabia, an 
MLR is prepared when requested by authority. 
  
Writing the MLR efficiently will provide a comprehensive 
understanding of how critical the injury is and its significance, 
helping the law enforcement agencies to further investigate and 
decide. 
Medico-legal 
documentation 
contains 
the 
holistic 
documentation of the clinical aspects of a case and information 
required by the courts. Documentation of injury may include the 
type, size, location, direction of injury, age of injury, and recovery 
time and direction of injury. Therefore, an MLR is critical since it 
provides significant written evidence of the medical expert to the 
courts. Incorrect or incomplete reports may trigger a pause or delay 
in legal proceedings, and victims’ rights could be violated. The 
most common errors in MLR are poor identification of external 
traumatic 
lesion, 
failure 
to 
document 
cooperative, 
and 
consciousness status. Documentation of the type of injury and its 
description helps in inferring the causative weapon or agent. For 
instance, abrasions, contusions, and lacerations are caused by blunt 
force impact, whereas incised wounds are caused by sharp force 
impact. 1 
 
The above expression says that a medico-legal case (MLC) applies to any 
case of injury or medical condition in which law enforcement agencies 
seek to investigate and fix the responsibility regarding the said injury or 
medical condition. Fixation of responsibility connotes that injury or 
medical condition should be result of any criminal activity whereas falling 
ill being misfortune could be result of any epidemic, or system failure due

subject of medicolegal work; therefore, three-tiers mechanism for 
medicolegal work does not apply on the subject in hand.

(a) The orders of Government shall be obtained through the Inspector-General, 
in cases in which a convicted or under trial prisoner is to be admitted to the

treatment as an out-patient only or for X-ray examination, the Superintendent 
of the prison is empowered to authorize this visit himself.

make an immediate report to Government in all cases in which he allows 
prisoners to be so moved in anticipation of sanction.  
(iii) In all cases in which a prisoner is removed to a hospital for the purpose of

Case of a prisoner seriously ill on release 
Rule141.  
No prisoner suffering from an acute or serious illness shall be discharged from

Rule143. (i) The Superintendent [will refer the case for] release of prisoner 
suffering from serious illness with the consent of the [Officer Incharge of the 
Prosecution] in whose jurisdiction the prisoner's offence was committed, 
provided that: -  
(a) the disease is likely to prove fatal if the prisoner; remains in prison;  
(b) there is reasonable chance of recovery if the prisoner is released. 
(c) the prisoner has not done any willful act, since he has been in 
prison, to produce or aggravate his disease;  
(d) the Medical Officer and the Medical Superintendent of the District 
Headquarter Hospital recommend the release and certify that the 
disease is of the nature described; and  
(e) the prisoner has not more than six months to remain in prison before 
the expiry of his sentence.  
(ii) The prisoner shall be informed, before release that his liberation is 
conditional on the sanction of the Government, and that if such sanction is 
withheld, he will have to return to prison to serve the remainder of his 
sentence. The prisoner's friends shall be sent for and a security bond taken 
from them, before he is released, that they will give him up if required to do so.

Officer. The Inspector General will, in all such cases, obtain the medical 
opinion of the Medical Board which will be convened by the Director of 
Health Services.  
The board will send its opinion through the Inspector General Prisons. 
 
Chapter-18 of Pakistan Prisons Rules, 1978 ranging from Rules 433 to 
455 specifically deals with prisoners under mental ailments.  

Writ Petition No.53882/2022.

10.   The responsibility assigned to the medical officer and jail 
superintendent though amenable to a check by Inspector General of Prison 
who can be approached upon in case of any flagrant violations of duty by 
them, yet an oversight mechanism is also in place whereby District 
Coordination Officers and Sessions Judges were authorized to ensure that 
the law and rules applicable on the subject be followed in letter and spirit. 
The relevant rules are as under; 
Visit by official visitors:  
Rule 914.  
(i) [District Co-ordination Officer] and Sessions Judges shall visit the prison at 
their headquarters at least once in three months and those in other district in 
their divisions when on tour. 
(ii) [District Co-ordination Officer] shall visit the prisons situated in their 
jurisdictions at least once a month. (iii) In January each year, the 
Superintendent shall submit a report to Government through the Inspector 
General, giving the number of visits made by the visitors during the previous 
years. 
Duties of official visitors:  
Rule 915.  
(i) Any official visitor may examine any book, paper and record in the prison, 
and may interview any prisoner confined therein.  
(ii) It shall be the duty of every official visitor to satisfy himself that the 
provisions of the Prisons. Act, 1894, and of all rules, regulations, orders and 
directions made or issued thereunder, are duly observed, and to bear and bring 
to notice any complaint or representation made by any prisoners. 
  
11.     The managerial scheme of prisoners’ health maintenance is obvious 
from the rules cited above; the double check of Medical Staff and Jail 
Superintendent within the jail premises and an oversight mechanism by 
Inspector General of Prison, Sessions Judge and District Coordination 
officer (now Deputy Commissioner) ensures that no prisoner should be 
deprived of his right to treatment. The opinion of medical officer is 
always conditional to subsequent examination by a board if constituted. 
Though constitution of board figures only in Rule 146 above, yet there is 
no specific prohibition for constitution of medical board in other cases as 
well. The core issue is not the ailment or deteriorating health condition, it 
is the question whether such ailment could be managed within jail 
premises and this decision can only be made by a court assuming 

Writ Petition No.53882/2022. 
11 
 
jurisdiction for question of liberty of prisoner in such cases, and of course 
such decision is taken keeping in view the opinion of jail medical officer, 
jail superintendent and on report of an expert, if any. Petitioner can well 
assert his contentions before the court dealing with bail application; this 
exercise in duplication is beyond comprehension when no law supports 
constitution of Provincial Medical Board in such matters.  
12.     For what has been discussed above, the order impugned herein, 
being far from any legal, factual or jurisdictional error is unexceptionable; 
thus, the same is upheld and the instant writ petition is dismissed.

order
