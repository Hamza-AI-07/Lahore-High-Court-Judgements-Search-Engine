Date of hearing:     
  24.04.2024. 
Appellant by: 
 Rai Sajid Ali Kharal, Advocate. 
 
Respondent No.1 by:  Mr. Nauman Sarwar, Advocate. 
  
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J. / CHAIRMAN:- 
Through instant appeal, appellant has assailed vires of order 
dated 20.10.2023, passed by respondent, whereby appellant’s 
representation for expunction of remarks recorded in his 
Performance Evaluation Report (“PER”) was declined.  
2.  
Brief facts of the case are that vide letter dated 
12.09.2023,  appellant was communicated remarks recorded by 
the then District & Sessions Judge, Gujranwala, in his PER 
regarding period from 24.09.2022 to 31.12.2022.  Appellant 
filed representation but the same was declined vide impugned 
order dated 20.10.2023. Hence, instant appeal. 
3. 
Learned counsel for appellant submits that the impugned 
remarks were communicated as “advisory” but in fact the same 
are “adverse” in nature as the same relate to dignity and 
integrity of the appellant. He adds that appellant’s work, 
conduct, dignity and integrity remained up to the mark in his 
entire service career, which is reflected from his PERs and even 
otherwise, the impugned remarks are vague and without 
reference to any particular instance justifying formulation of the 

 
Service Appeal No.18 of 2023

opinion, thus, same are liable to be expunged. He has placed 
reliance upon Noor Elahi v. Director of Civilian Personnnel, 
Rear Air Headquarters, Peshawar and 2 others (1997 SCMR 
1749) and Malik Azhar-ul-Haq v. Registrar, Lahore High 
Court, Lahore [2012 PLC (C.S.) 1208].  
4. 
On the contrary, learned counsel for respondent submits 
that the remarks are advisory, and need not to be expunged. He 
adds that neither representation nor Service Appeal lies against 
such remarks. He has relied upon Government of the Punjab 
and another v. Ehsan ul Haq Sethi (PLD 1986 Supreme Court 
684), Engineer Jameel Ahmed Malik v. Pakistan Ordinance 
Factories Board, Wah Cantt. through Chairman and others 
(2004 SCMR 164), Lahore High Court, Lahore through 
Registrar v. Muhammad Jaangir Khan Goraya (1999 SCMR 
2117), Shaukat Javed Farooq, under Secretary Civil 
Secretariat, Lahore v. District and Sessions Judge, Lahore and 
others (1999 SCMR 2141) and Ch. Shabbir Hussain and others 
v. Registrar, Lahore High Court, Lahore and others (PLD 2004 
Supreme Court 191). 
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused.  
6. 
Appellant is aggrieved of the remarks appearing in his 
PER for the period from 24.09.2022 to 31.12.2022, which 
according to him being “adverse remarks” are problematic for 
his service career whereas stance of respondent is that the 
remarks were “advisory” for improvement of the appellant. For 
ease of reference, the remarks in question are reproduced as 
under:- 
 
Part-V 
a) Pen Picture 
 
“He is advised to run his office with dignity and integrity.”  
 
7. 
The question for determination before us is whether the 
impugned remarks are “adverse” or “advisory” in nature. We 
are mindful of the fact that mere caption of the remarks is not 
the determining factor, rather nature and essence of the remarks 

 
Service Appeal No.18 of 2023

would lead to the conclusion as to whether these remarks are 
“advisory” or “adverse”. Adverse remarks indicate the defects 
or deficiencies in the quality of work or performance or conduct 
of a civil servant except the words in the nature of counsel or 
advice. Adverse remarks could be deciphered from the words 
used by the reporting officer in his remarks and the impact 
those words might have on the reputation and general image of 
the officer. Adverse remarks do not become advisory even if the 
reporting officer calls them advisory or the authority treats them 
so. Moreover, advisory remarks, at the time of promotion of the 
civil servant, would become adverse and carry stigma if it is 
found that despite the advice the officer did not make any 
improvement. Reference can be made to Government of the 
Punjab and Another v. Ehsanul Haq Sethi (PLD 1986 Supreme 
Court 684), Engineer Jameel Ahmed Malik v. Pakistan 
Ordinance Factories Board, Wah Cantt through Chairman and 
Others [2004 P L C (C.S.) 130 Supreme Court], Malik Azhar-
Ul-Haq v. Registrar, Lahore High Court, Lahore [2012 PLC 
(C.S.) 1208 Punjab Subordinate Judiciary Service Tribunal] 
and Government of A.P. rep. by Chief Secretary v. Madanlal, 
IPS and another [2003(1) S.C.T.627]. 
 
In the case of Madanlal supra, Andhra Pradesh High 
Court observed that 'adverse remark ' means a remark, which 
indicates the defects or deficiencies in the quality of work or 
performance or conduct of an Officer, but does not include any 
word or words in the nature of counsel or advice to the Officer.
 
In the case of Malik Azhar-Ul-Haq supra, the appellant 
had prayed for expunction of remarks "some stinking news 
about integrity of the appellant have started pouring in, he 
should be careful (advisory)" recorded against him by the 
Inspection Judge. The Tribunal apparently by considering the 
words used by the reporting officer in his remarks and the 
impact those words might have on the reputation and general 

 
Service Appeal No.18 of 2023 
4
image of the officer, considered those remarks to be adverse 
even though the word advisory was clearly written against them 
by the reporting officer. 
8. 
We have perused the contents of PER in question and it is 
not evident that any counseling was made to appellant by the 
Reporting Officer to improve his performance. There is 
nothing on record to justify his departure from the above 
general rule of making prior counselling before recording the 
adverse remarks. It is noteworthy that instructions contained 
in the PUNJAB ESTACODE Edition 2019, BOOK VII 
Captioned as “Instructions about Confidential Reports” and 
under the heading Ancillary Instructions, have not been  
followed in this case. The matter of prior counselling before 
adverse remarks is mentioned vide D.O. No. 6/1/84-PDII, Dated 
12th February 1984 from Establishment Secretary, Cabinet 
Secretariat, Government of Pakistan, Rawalpindi, to the Chief 
Secretary to Government of the Punjab, Circulated vide 
Endorsement No. SOR-IV(S&GAD) 14-13/78(P) dated 16th 
May 1984 with the subject: WRITING OF ANNUAL 
CONFIDENTIAL REPORTS. It dealt with counselling under 
Para 2(2) which is reproduced as under: 
“(2) Counseling  
Adverse remarks are often recorded by the reporting officers 
without prior counseling to the officer reported upon. This is 
contrary to the existing instructions and is in fact, a reflection 
on the reporting officer. They are expected to counsel an 
officer about his weak points and advise him how to improve. 
Adverse remarks should normally be recorded only when the 
officer fails to improve despite counseling.” 
9. 
It is well-settled that the Reporting or Countersigning 
Officers are obliged to offer counselling as to the 
performance of an officer apprising his weak points and 
advise him/her how to improve, and if the officer fails to 
improve despite counselling then adverse remarks may be 
recorded in the PER. It is up to the supervisory officers to see 
whether the counselling, advice or warning is to be given 

 
Service Appeal No.18 of 2023 
5
orally or in written form, or given publically in a general 
meeting of the officers or privately in a separate meeting with 
the concerned officer only. The primary purpose of the 
supervision is to guide the subordinate officers in improving 
their performance and efficiency, and that their role is more 
like a mentor rather than a punishing authority. The directions 
contained in the instructions, in this regard, on paying great 
attention to the manner and method of communicating advice 
or warning should be adhered to. The object of counselling is 
to improve the performance and efficiency of a subordinate 
officer, which can ultimately benefit the organization as it 
enables identifying and addressing performance issues before 
they become major problems. The Supreme Court of Pakistan 
in Director General, Intelligence Bureau v. Riaz-ul-Wahab 
and others (2023 SCMR 877), while discussing the rationale 
behind the writing of PER, has observed as under: 
“5.    PERs are the most important documents in the 
service record of civil servants. They help the competent 
authorities in making informed decisions with regards to 
personnel administration matters, such as, selections for 
training, 
appointments 
/ 
transfers, 
promotions, 
confirmations or screening of civil servants. An officer's 
promotion and retention in service mostly depends on 
what has been recorded in his/her PER. It is, therefore, 
essential that the PERs are written by the Reporting and 
Countersigning Officers most carefully and responsibly. 
The PER forms that elaborate the criteria against which 
the performance of a subordinate officer is to be 
evaluated, and the instructions issued with regards to 
properly recording the PERs, are designed to ensure 
reporting on an officer's strong and weak points more 
objectively, as only objective reporting can effectively 
serve the true purpose of such reports. If the Reporting or 
the Countersigning Officer is partial, his opinion is likely to 
cause incalculable damage to the officer reported upon, 
and if a PER is ambiguous or carelessly written, it would 
not serve the true purpose of recording PERs. Therefore, 
the Reporting and Countersigning Officers should 
evaluate the performance of the officer reported upon in a 
detached and objective manner, in accordance with the 
instructions issued on the subject.”

10. 
In view of the foregoing, we are of the candid opinion 
that remarks in question are “adverse” and cannot be considered 
“advisory” by any stretch of imagination. The available record 
does not provide basis or direct evidence for the remarks i.e. he 
is advised to run his office with dignity and integrity and even 
the said remarks were recorded without prior counselling, thus, 
the same are unsustainable. The case law, cited by learned 
counsel for respondent, being distinguishable, is not attracted to 
the facts and circumstances of this case.  
11. 
Resultantly, this appeal is allowed and impugned order is 
set aside. Consequently, impugned remarks in appellant’s PER 
for the period from 24.09.2022 to 31.12.2022 stand expunged.
