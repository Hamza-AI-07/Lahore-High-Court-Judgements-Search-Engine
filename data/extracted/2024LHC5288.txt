Date of hearing:

Petitioners by: 
M/s Syed Kaleem Ahmad Khurshid 
and Ch. Sultan Mahmood Kamboh, 
Advocates. 
 
Respondents by: 
Nemo. 
 
AHMAD NADEEM ARSHAD, J. This Civil Revision is 
directed against the order dated 25.06.2005, whereby, the learned 
lower appellate Court dismissed petitioners’ application under 
Section 152 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (C.P.C) for 
correction of the decree dated 17.12.1995. 
2.            Facts in brevity are that the petitioners instituted a suit on 
25.09.1974 for declaration of their title and recovery of possession 
of the land measuring 32 kanals 10 marlas against the respondents; 
that the respondents resisted the suit through filing written 
statement in contrast; that the learned trial Court after framing of 
necessary issues, recording of evidence of the parties pro and contra, 
oral as well as documentary, dismissed the suit vide judgment and 
decree dated  22.04.1990; that feeling aggrieved the petitioners 
preferred an appeal which was allowed by the learned first 
appellate Court vide judgment and decree dated 17.12.1995 and set-
aside the judgment and decree of learned trial Court dated 
22.04.1990 and declared that the petitioners are still owners to the 
extent of one half share in respect of the suit property allegedly 
gifted away to Muhammad Suleman through mutation No.306 
dated 30.09.1962 and dismissed to the extent of the remaining land; 
that the petitioners on 06.06.2005 moved an application under 

Civil Revision No.1499 of 2012. 
-2-
Section 152 of C.P.C., with the contention that while preparing the 
decree, the relief of possession was omitted by the learned appellate 
Court, therefore, the decree does not agree with the judgment and 
they could not be refused due to omission while formulating the 
decree; that the learned appellate Court after providing opportunity 
of hearing dismissed the said application vide impugned order 
dated 25.06.2005. Being dissatisfied, the petitioners invoked the 
revisional jurisdiction of this Court by filing instant revision 
petition. 
3.          This Court after proclamation published in the newspaper 
vide order dated 15.10.2024 proceeded ex-parte against the 
respondents No.1 to 17, 20, 24 to 25-D. Today no one appeared on 
behalf of the respondents No.19-A to 19-E, 21-A to 21-C, 22-A to 
22-G and 23-A to 23-D despite the name of learned counsel for the 
said respondents is duly reflected in today’s cause list, therefore, 
they are also proceeded against ex-parte. 
4. 
     I have heard learned counsel for the petitioners at full 
length and perused the record with his able assistance and also gone 
through the case laws cited at bar. 
5.       Learned counsel for the petitioners maintained that section 
151 CPC provides inherent jurisdiction to the Courts to make such 
orders as may be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent the 
abuse of process of the Court; that Section 152 C.P.C., provides 
that clerical or arithmetical mistakes in judgments, decrees, orders 
or errors arising therein from any accidental slip or omission may at 
any time be corrected by the Courts either of its own motion or on 
the application of the any of the parties; that while preparing decree, 
the relief of possession was omitted by the learned appellate Court; 
that the decree passed by the learned Additional District Judge, 
dated 17.12.1995, does not agree with the judgment; that the 
petitioner cannot be refused due to omission while formulating the 
decree ; that the said decree has not been drawn in accordance with 
the form prescribed and while relying upon the judgments “Ram 
Singh v. Sant Singh and others” (A.I.R. 1930 Lahore 210), 

Civil Revision No.1499 of 2012. 
-3-
“Maharaj Pullu Lal v. Sripal Singh and others” (A.R.I. 1937 
Oudh 191), “FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN and another vs. Haji 
MUHAMMAD SAIFULLAH KHAN and others” (PLD 1989 
Supreme Court 166), “BANK OF CREDIT AND COMMERCE 
INTERNATIONAL (OVERSEAS) Ltd vs. Messrs ALI ASMESTOS 
INDUSTRIES Ltd and 5 others” (1990 MLD 130), “BCCI s. ALI 
ASBESTOS LIMITED” (NLR 1992 Civil 771) and “Mst. AKHTAR 
SULTANA vs. Major Retd. MUZAFFAR KHAN MALIK through his 
legal heirs and others” (PLD 2021 Supreme Court 715) prayed 
for setting-aside of the order dated 25.06.2005 of learned lower 
appellate Court and prayed for incorporation of the prayer of 
possession in the decree. 
6. 
     No doubt, the Courts have inherent powers under section 
151 C.P.C., to make such orders as may be necessary to meet the 
ends of justice or to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court 
but the said powers are to be exercised to secure the ends of justice. 
7.      Admittedly Section 152 C.P.C., gives an authority to the 
Court to correct the clerical or arithmetical mistakes even of its own 
motion as none should suffer due to mistake of the Court. 
8. 
  In the instant case the most critical point for determination 
is that whether there is any clerical or arithmetical mistake due to 
error of the Court which required to be corrected. Perusal of the 
judgment dated 17.12.1995 it appears that the learned lower 
appellate Court accepted the petitioners’ appeal partially and 
dismissed rest of the appeal in the following manner: - 
“13. On the basis of what has been discussed above, the 
instant appeal stands accepted and the impugned judgment 
and 
decree 
are 
set-aside 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
the 
appellants/plaintiffs are still owners to the extent of one half 
share in respect of the suit land allegedly gifted away to 
Muhammad Suleman, the original donor of the same vide 
mutation No.306 dated 30.09.1962. Appeal to the extent of 
remaining land shall stand dismissed. Parties are left to bear 
their own costs.” 
 
Whereas the decree sheet was prepared in the following 
terms:- 

Civil Revision No.1499 of 2012. 
-4-
“This appeal coming on 13.12.1995 before me (Ch. 
Faiz Talib Khan) Addl. District Judge, Sheikhupura 
for final disposal, in the presence of Mr.Saeed Iqbal 
Saleemi, Advocate, counsel for the appellants, and Ch. 
Imtiaz Ali Khan, Advocate, counsel for respondents 
No.1 to 5 and 7 to 18. It is ordered that appeal is 
accepted and impugned judgment and decree are set-
aside to the extent that the appellants/plaintiffs are still 
owners to the extent of ½ share in respect of the suit 
land allegedly gifted away to Muhammad Suleman, the 
original donor of the same vide mutation No.306, 
dated 30.09.1962. Appeal to the extent of the 
remaining land shall stands dismissed. Parties are left 
to bear their own costs.” 
 
9. 
      Perusal of the judgment dated 17.12.1995 and decree it 
appears that the said decree is drawn in accordance with the 
judgment. The decree drawn does agree with the judgment. There is 
no variance between the judgment and decree. The decree is totally 
in accordance with the judgment and is not at variance. I have not 
found any arithmetical or clerical mistake in the judgment and 
decree. The grievance of the petitioners is that relief of possession 
was omitted while preparing the decree but from perusal of the 
judgment it appears that the relief of possession was not given even 
in the judgment. 
10. 
      From perusal of the plaint it appears that the petitioners 
prayed in the following terms: -

From perusal of prayer clause as narrated in the plaint it 
appears that the petitioners sought two reliefs firstly they sought 
declaration to the effect that they are owners in possession of a 
piece of land measuring 14 kanals 10 marlas in square No.163, 

Civil Revision No.1499 of 2012. 
-5-
killa No.17, 04 kanals 09 marlas, square No.176, killa No.2, 03 
kanals 03 marlas, killa No.3, 06 kanals 18 marlas according to the 
record of rights for the years 1970-71 by challenging the gift 
mutation No.306 dated 30.09.1962 and secondly they sought 
recovery of possession of land measuring 32 kanals 10 marlas 
situated at square No.152, killa No.10 measuring 06 kanals 14 
marlas, square No.153 killa No.9 measuring 04 kanals 09 marlas, 
killa No.10 measuring 08 kanals 18 marlas, square No.176 killa 
No.2 measuring 03 kanals 11 marlas, killa No.9 measuring 08 
kanals 18 marlas, according to the record of rights for the years 
1970-71, Jatheri-Khena, Tehsil & District Sheikhupura. 
11.        
The petitioners/plaintiffs in their suit challenged the 
veracity of gift mutation No.306 dated 30.09.1962 (Exh.P-8/Exh.D-
1), whereby, Din Muhammad son of Ali Sher (defendant No.2), 
Ghulam Din son of Rehmat Ullah (defendant No.1), Muhammad 
Hussain son of Allah Bakhsh (plaintiff No.1/petitioner No.1) gifted 
their land measuring 13 kanals 03 marlas to Muhammad Suleman, 
predecessor of the defendants No.3 to 6 namely Ghulam 
Muhammad, Khan Muhammad, Hassan Muhammad and Ghulam 
Fatima. The learned trial Court in this regard framed issue No.8 in 
the following terms:- 
“Issue No.8: Whether the mutation of gift No.306 dated 30.09.1962 is 
fictitious, based upon fraud and is without consideration? 
OPP.” 
 
The learned trial Court decided said issue in favour of the 
petitioners/plaintiffs and against the respondents/defendants and 
declared that mutation No.306 was fictitious, based on fraud and 
was without consideration. However, the learned appellate Court 
held that the impugned mutation of gift stands cancelled to the 
extent of ½ share owned by the petitioners/appellants. 
12. 
      The petitioners in their suit themselves claimed to be 
owners in possession of the suit property measuring 14 kanals 10 
marlas and the learned Courts below while accepting their claim 
granted the relief sought by them. Now the question arises when the 

Civil Revision No.1499 of 2012. 
-6-
petitioners themselves claimed that they are in possession of the 
property and sought only declaration then how the Court could 
grant them relief of possession with regard to land measuring 14 
kanals 10 marlas.  
13. 
 
The petitioners in their suit challenged the veracity of 
inheritance mutation No.292 dated 30.09.1962 (Exh.P-7) of Atta 
Muhammad, whereby, the suit property was inherited to Din 
Muhammad (defendant No.2), Ghulam Din (defendant No.1) and 
Muhammad Hussain (plaintiff No.1). They claimed that their father 
namely Allah Bakhsh was entitled to inherit the whole property of 
Atta Muhammad. The learned trial Court with regard to the said 
controversy framed issues No.9 & 10 in the following terms: - 
“Issue No.9. Whether the mutation No.292 dated 30.09.1962 is 
null and void and whether the plaintiffs’ are exclusive heirs of 
Allah Bakhsh, if so, its effect ? OPP. 
 
Issue No.10. Whether the plaintiffs are owners of land in dispute? 
OPP.” 
 
The learned trial Court decided issue No.9 in favour of the 
petitioners and issue No.10 against them. The learned appellate 
Court while deciding issues No.9 & 10 declared that mutation 
No.292 dated 30.09.1962 in favour of Rehmat Ullah is void ab- 
initio and held that the petitioners being successors-in-interest of 
Allah Bakhsh deceased are entitled to one half share out of the 
estate of Atta Muhammad deceased, whereas, the remaining one 
half share is owned by Din Muhammad (defendant No.2). 
Consequently, sale by Din Muhammad (defendant No.2) in favour 
of Bashir Ahmad (defendant No.7) and Din Muhammad (defendant 
No.8) was held to be lawful and legal. 
14.        The learned trial Court vide judgment and decree dated 
22.04.1990 non-suited the petitioners by declaring their suit barred 
by time and decided issue No.1 against them. The learned appellate 
Court reversed the findings of the learned trial Court and decided 
issue No.1 in their favour by declaring that their suit is within time. 

Civil Revision No.1499 of 2012. 
-7-
15. 
     With regard to the second relief, whereby, the petitioners 
sought recovery of possession, the learned trial Court, keeping in 
view the stance taken by the respondents/defendants framed issue 
No.7 in the following terms:- 
“Issue No. 7.Whether the defendants No.1-3 to 6 have 
become owners through adverse possession? OPD.” 
 
The learned trial Court decided the said issue in favour of the 
respondents/defendants by declaring that the defendants have 
matured their title by adverse possession as under:- 
“Issue No.7. It is an admitted fact that the disputed land was 
mutated in favour of the defendants in 1962 and since then 
they are in possession of the suit. The present suit was 
instituted in 1974 that is exactly after 12 years. The 
possession of the defendants is proved by documentary as 
well as oral evidence, I therefore, conclude that the 
defendants have matured their title by adverse possession. 
This issue is decided in favour of the defendants.” 
 
16. 
        Section 28 of the Limitation Act, 1908 was enforced 
when the learned trial Court passed the judgment and decree on 
22.04.1990. But later on the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
the case titled “Maqbool Ahmad vs. Government of Pakistan” (1991 
SCMR 2063) declared provisions of Section 28 repugnant to 
injunctions of Islam by declaring that any suit on the basis of 
adverse possession is not maintainable from 31.08.1991. The 
Government of Pakistan vide Limitation (amendment Act-II) of 
1995 (PLD 1996 Central Statute 1296) omitted Section 28 from the 
Limitation Act, 1908 on 18.10.1995. In this way Section 28 of the 
Limitation Act, 1908 has ceased to have any effect from 31.08.1991 
and was omitted from the Limitation Act on 18.10.1995. 
17. 
      The learned appellate Court while discussing the fate of 
issues No.1 & 5 declared that findings of the learned Civil Judge on 
issues No.1 & 7 are set-aside. It appears that the figure “7” was 
inadvertently written in para 12 instead of figure “5” as the learned 
appellate Court in para 11 & 12 have discussed issues No.1 & 5 and 
did not discuss the defendants’ claim of adverse possession. The 

Civil Revision No.1499 of 2012. 
-8-
learned appellate Court failed to give any independent finding with 
regard to issue No.7. 
18. 
 
Judgment is verdict or decision of the Court usually 
recorded after recording the evidence and hearing the contesting 
parties. It is a conclusive judicial determination of rights of parties 
in any legal proceedings. Decree, is formal expression of opinion of 
the Court, it follows the judgment. When conclusion of the Court is 
translated into executable form, it is reflected in the “decree”. 
Decree must be drawn in consonance and in conformity with 
decision of the Court. Order XX Rule 6 C.P.C. defines contents of 
decree which reads as follows:- 
Rule 6. Contents of decree.—(1) The decree shall agree with the 
judgment; it shall contain the number of the suit, the names and 
descriptions of the parties, and particulars of the claim, and shall 
specify clearly the relief granted or other determination of the suit. 
(2) 
The decree shall also state the amount of costs incurred in 
the suit, and by whom or out of what property and in what 
proportions such costs are to be paid. 
The Court may direct that the costs payable to one party by 
the other shall be set off against any sum, which is admitted or 
found to be due from the former to the latter.” 
 
19. 
 
On reading Rule 6 of Order XX of C.P.C., it is but 
clear that, the decree should be in accordance and in conformity 
with the judgment. Decree in fact is will of the Court. It is true 
reflection of the judicial determination of rights of the parties made 
by the Court. It is the decree that is executed or implemented. It is 
duty of the Court, while drawing the decree, to specify clearly the 
relief granted or other determination of rights of the parties in the 
suit so as to make it conformity with the will of the Court capable 
of enforcement. For reference “SHAUKAT ISMAIL CHARANIA 
versus Mrs. SHAKEELA HAYAT KHAN and others” (2006 CLC 
1126). 
20. 
 
Now the question whether the omission in the decree 
for delivery of possession could be supplemented in exercise of the 
authority under Section 152 C.P.C. It would be beneficial to 
reproduce Section 152 of C.P.C. which reads as follows:- 
“Section 152. Amendment of judgment, decrees or orders:--- 
Clerical or arithmetical mistakes in judgments, decrees, or orders 

Civil Revision No.1499 of 2012. 
-9-
or errors arising therein from any accidental slip or omission may 
at any time be corrected by the Court either of its own motion or 
on the application of any of the parties.” 
 
21. 
 
The Court has the powers under Section 152 C.P.C., to 
amend the orders or decrees, to remove, inter-alia, errors arising 
therein, from any accidental slip or omission and this power can, in 
express terms of the Section be exercised at any time. The plain 
reading of Section, leaves no doubt whatsoever, that the power 
conferred on the Court, if the case falls within the purview of the 
provisions, can be exercised at any time and it has accordingly been 
held that there is no time limit for entertaining an application in that 
behalf. Also it is apparent that the power can be exercised suo motu. 
It has however, been held that the fact that powers of Court under 
Section 152 C.P.C., are unlimited does not mean that they will be 
exercised in all cases in which an application for their exercise is 
made. The exercise of power will depend on the circumstances of 
each case. The power is, therefore, discretionary with the Court, 
although normally where the provision of section 152 C.P.C., are 
attracted it will order amendment, unless it is inequitable to do so. 
For reference “Mst. FAROSHA versus FAZAL GUL and others” 
(PLD 1983 Supreme Court 220). 
22. 
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan while dealing 
with power of the Court under Section 152 C.P.C., in a case titled 
“Syed SAADI JAFRI ZAINABI versus LAND ACQUISITION 
COLLECTOR and Assistant Commissioner” (PLD 1992 Supreme 
Court 472) held as under: - 
“Section 152 enables a Court to correct the mistake, omission or error in 
the judgment, decree or order which has crept into it inadvertently and 
unintentionally. Such mistakes are mostly caused due to inadvertent 
mistake of the Court. The rules of procedure as provided by C.P.C. are 
intended to foster justice, therefore, no one should be allowed to suffer 
due to the mistake of the Court. 
9. 
The Court has jurisdiction to correct the clerical or arithmetical 
mistakes or errors caused due to accidental slip or omission in a 
judgment, decree or order. Depending on facts, it confers a wide 
discretion on the Court to correct, (i) clerical or arithmetical mistake, (ii) 
errors caused due to accidental slip or omission in the judgment, decree 
or order. Such power can be exercised at any time. Where the Court is 
bound to grant a relief which the party seeks, or where the Court is 
bound to grant relief even without it being sought by a party and if 
unintentionally or inadvertently the Court does not grant such relief, it 

Civil Revision No.1499 of 2012. 
-10-
would be justified at any time to correct such accidental omission or 
error by exercising power under Section 152.” 
 
23 
 
Thus it could be said that “accidental slip or omission” 
as used in Section 152 C.P.C., means to leave out or failure to 
mention, something unintentionally, it is only where the slip or 
omission as accidental or unintentionally it could be supplemented 
or added in exercise of jurisdiction conferred under Section 152 
C.P.C. Such course is provided to foster cause of justice, to 
suppress mischief and to avoid multiplicity of proceedings. 
However, where slip or omission is intentional and deliberate, it 
could only be remedied or corrected by way of review if 
permissible or in appeal or revision as the case may be. 
24. 
 
In the light of above said discussion, when considered 
the judgment of the learned appellate Court, it appears that the 
learned appellate Court modified the finding of learned trial Court 
with regard to issue No.8 and cancelled the gift mutation No.306 
dated 30.09.1962 to the extent of one half share owned by the 
petitioners. The learned appellate Court also modified the findings 
of the learned trial Court upon issues No.9 & 10 and declared that 
Atta Muhammad’s inheritance mutation No.292 dated 30.09.1962 
in favour of Rehmat Ullah is void. The petitioners being successors 
in interest of Allah Bakhsh deceased are entitled to one half share 
out of the estate of Atta Muhammad deceased, whereas, the 
remaining one half is owned by Din Muhammad and validated the 
sale made by Din Muhammad  in favour of Bashir Ahmad 
(defendant No.7) and Din Muhammad (defendant No.8). 
25. 
 
The learned trial Court vide its judgment and decree 
declared the possession of the defendants valid on the basis of 
adverse possession but the learned appellate Court did not alter or 
set-aside the findings of the learned trial Court. The said slip or 
omission is not accidental or unintentional rather it seems to be 
intentional and deliberate. Therefore, if the petitioners had any 
grievance from the impugned judgment and decree dated 
17.12.1995 of the learned first appellate Court, then they should 

Civil Revision No.1499 of 2012. 
-11-
have approached the superior Courts for redressal of their grievance 
but they never challenged said judgment and decree and it attained 
the status of finality. Admittedly, the judgment attained finality 
cannot be altered even with the consent of the parties. The decree is 
totally in accordance with the judgment, hence, does not call for 
any rectification under Section 151 & 152 C.P.C.  
26. 
 
Learned counsel for the petitioners failed to point out 
any illegality, irregularity or jurisdiction defect in the impugned 
order of the learned appellate Court. The case law referred to by the 
learned counsel for the petitioners have no relevancy with the facts 
and circumstances of the case, so not helpful to the petitioners. 
27. 
 
Epitome of above discussion is that the instant Civil 
Revision is without any merits, hence, dismissed with no order as to 
costs.
