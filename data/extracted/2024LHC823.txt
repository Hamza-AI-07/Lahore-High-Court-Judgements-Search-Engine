Ch. Muhammad Jameel, Assistant 
Attorney General for Pakistan.  
 
AHMAD NADEEM ARSHAD, J.  Through this Constitution 
Petition filed under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973, petitioners have assailed the vires of 
order dated 30.08.2016 passed by respondent No.1 whereby while 
exercising the power under Section 265 of the Companies Ordinance, 
1984, a Chartered Accountant was appointed as Inspector for 
carrying out investigation into the affairs of the Company and to give 
findings and prayed as under: 
“It is therefore respectfully prayed that this Hon’ble Court may 
graciously be pleased to make an order: 
a. Declaring that the order dated 30.08.2016 (Annex-A) passed 
by respondent No.1 accepting the application of the 
respondent No.2 is without lawful authority and of no legal 
effect; and  
b. Granting such other or further relief to the petitioners as this 
Hon’ble Court may deem fit.  
2. 
The relevant facts necessary for the disposal of this petition 
are that Sardar Ghazanfar Ullah Khan predecessor of the parties 

W.P. No.8594 of 2016/BWP.

along with others formed a public limited company with the name 
and style of “M/S ISAKHEL ESTATE FARMS LTD.” Moza Basti 
Isakhel Estate, Tehsil & District Rahim Yar Khan registered under 
the Companies Act, 1913 and now functioning under the terms of 
Companies Ordinance, 1984 (hereinafter referred to as the Ordinance, 
1984). Some disputes arose between the Shareholders and Directors, 
therefore, respondent No.2 filed a petition u/s 152 and 290 of the 
Ordinance, 1984, before this Court. Said petition was disposed of by 
this Court vide order dated 10.04.2015 through transmitting a copy 
of the petition along with all its annexures to the Security and 
Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) with the direction to treat 
it as an application and decide the same strictly in accordance with 
law. The SECP/respondent No.1 after receiving the order of this 
Court issued show-cause notices to the Chief Executive and 
Directors of the Company under Section 265 of the Ordinance, 1984. 
After getting reply of the show-cause notices and providing 
opportunity of hearing, vide order dated 30.08.2016, appointed a 
Chartered Accountant as Inspector for carrying out investigation into 
the affairs of the Company as per terms of reference. Petitioners 
impugned said order through instant Constitutional Petition. 
3. 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and 
perused the record with their able assistance.  
4. 
Main grievance of the petitioners is that impugned order is 
violative of the direction given by this Court through order dated 
10.04.2015 while deciding C.O. No.01 of 1995 whereby the petition 
filed by respondent No.2 was transmitted to the respondent No.1 for 
decision of the same and no direction was given to pass any order in 
terms of Section 265 of the Ordinance, 1984. Learned counsel for the 
petitioners in this regard argued that at the most application of the 
petitioners should have been treated as an application filed by the 
private person  under Section 263 of the Ordinance, 1984 and not 
under Section 265 of the Ordinance, 1984. He further clarified that 
jurisdiction under Section 265 of the Ordinance, 1984, can be 
exercised either on a resolution passed by the Company in General 

W.P. No.8594 of 2016/BWP. 
3
Meeting or on an order of the Company Court or in specified serious 
cases of fraud etc. under discretionary suo-motu jurisdiction and as 
none of the conditions were available, therefore, the impugned order 
is not sustainable. He adds that this Court did not issue any direction 
to proceed under Section 265 of the Ordinance, 1984. Further 
maintains that application under Section 263 of the Ordinance, 1984 
was also not maintainable as it requires Members holding not less 
than 1/10 of the total voting powers.  
5. 
For better understanding Section 265 of the Ordinance, 1984 
is reproduced as under: 
“265. Investigation of company’s affairs in other cases.- Without 
prejudice to its power under section 263, the Commission— 
(a) shall appoint one or more competent persons as inspectors to 
investigate the affairs of a company and to report thereon in such 
manner as the Commission may direct, if—  
(i) the company, by a resolution in general meeting, or  
(ii) the Court, by order, 
 declares that the affairs of the company ought to be 
investigated by an inspector appointed by the Commission; 
and  
(b) may appoint one or more competent persons as inspectors to 
investigate the affairs of a company and to report thereon in such 
manner as the Commission may direct if in the opinion of the 
Commission there are circumstances suggesting—  
(i) that the business of the company is being or has been 
conducted with intent to defraud its creditors, members or 
any other person or for a fraudulent or unlawful purpose, 
or in a manner oppressive of any of its members or that the 
company was formed for any fraudulent or unlawful 
purpose; or  
(ii) that persons concerned in the formation of the company 
or the management of its affairs have in connection 
therewith been guilty of fraud, misfeasance, breach of trust 
or other misconduct towards the company or towards any 
of its members or have been carrying on unauthorized 
business; or  
(iii) that the affairs of the company have been so conducted 
or managed as to deprive the members thereof of a 
reasonable return; or  

W.P. No.8594 of 2016/BWP. 
4
(iv) that the member of the company have not been given 
all the information with respect to its affairs which they 
might reasonably expect; or  
(v) that any shares of the company have been allotted for 
inadequate consideration; or  
(vi) that the affairs or the company are not being managed 
in accordance with sound business principles or prudent 
commercial practices; or  
(vii) that the financial position of the company is such as to 
endanger its solvency:  
 
Provided that, before making an order under clause (b), the 
Commission shall give the company an opportunity to show 
cause against the action proposed to be taken.” 
 
6. 
The Commission under Section 265 (a) of the Ordinance could 
appoint Inspector subject to fulfillment of pre-conditions mentioned 
therein but such pre-conditions are not applicable to its suo-motu 
powers under Section 265 (b) of the Ordinance, to appoint Inspector.  
7. 
The Commission has only to satisfy itself, prima-facie, on the 
basis of the material placed before it, that case for investigation 
through an Inspector is called for. The matter, in fact, vests in the 
discretion of the Commission, to be decided after following the 
summary procedure. In proceedings under Section 265 of the 
Ordinance, full-fledged inquiry in the form of a trial is not required 
to be held nor any formal evidence is to be recorded before passing 
the order under Section 265 of the Ordinance. The Authority has to 
only satisfy itself prima-facie, of course, on the basis of the material 
placed before it that a case for investigation through an Inspector is 
called for and it is for the Inspector to ascertain and determine the 
truth or otherwise of the allegation during the investigation to be 
conducted by him whereafter he has to submit report to the 
concerned Authority.  
8. 
Respondent No.1 while passing the impugned order issued 
show-cause notices to the Chief Executive and Directors of “M/s 
Isakhel Estate Farms Ltd.” and after going through the facts of the 

W.P. No.8594 of 2016/BWP. 
5
case, evidences produced by the parties, arguments advanced by the 
representatives observed as under: 
“In view of the foregoing observations, I am of the considered 
view that the affairs of the Company are as such which warrants 
deeper probe through appointment of a competent Inspector(s). 
Therefore, in exercise of the power conferred under Section 265 
of the Ordinance, read with S.R.O 154(1)/2015 dated 19.02.2015, 
I hereby appoint Mr. Talib, FCA of M/s PKF F.R.A.N.T.S 
Chartered 
Accountants 
as 
Inspector 
for 
carrying 
out 
investigation into the affairs of the Company as per annexed 
terms of reference (TORs). The Inspector is directed to analyze 
the TORs, give his findings after meeting all the requirements of 
the law, which should be supported with material evidence relied 
upon by him. He is further directed that each and every reported 
violation should not be vague and bear reference to relevant 
provisions of law.” 
9. 
Perusal of the record reflects that respondent No.2 while filing 
petition under Section 152 & 290 of the Ordinance, 1984 (C.O. 
No.1/1995) claimed that he holds shares of more than 20% of the 
total paid up capital of the Company and prayed as under: 
“Wherefore it is respectfully prayed that: 
 
a. That the register of members of the respondent No.1 be 
directed to be rectified so that the names of respondents No.2 
to 11 are deleted; 
b. That the fresh allotment and transfer of shares to the 
respondent No.2 to 11 be declared to be ineffective and 
inoperative in law; 
c. That the fraudulent sale of the assets of the Company vide 
resolution dated 13.12.1993 and sale deeds dated 
30.12.1993 and 03.01.1994 be held to be inoperative against 
the Company.  
d. That appropriate orders be passed for preserving the assets 
of the Company and its proper by its bona fide shareholders.  
Any other relief found fit and expedient in the circumstances of 
the case may also be passed.”  
 
 
10. 
This petition was disposed of by this Court vide order dated 
10.04.2015 in the following terms: 

W.P. No.8594 of 2016/BWP.

“Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that he would be 
satisfied if the matter is referred to SECP to investigate the 
alienations in terms of Section 265 of the Companies Ordinance, 
2004 (inadvertently written as 2004 instead of 1984) into the 
allegations levelled by the petitioner and thereafter decide the 
case in accordance with law under intimation to the Deputy 
Registrar (Judicial) of this Court.  
2. 
In view of the matter, a copy of this petition along with all 
its annexures is transmitted to SECP with the direction to treat it 
as an application filed by the petitioner and decide the same 
strictly in accordance with law under intimation to Deputy 
Registrar (Judicial) of this Court. Disposed of accordingly.” \ 
(Underline is mine) 
 
11. 
The expression used by this Court “Disposed of accordingly” 
has a significant meaning. It means that the petition was disposed of 
in terms of the submission made by the learned counsel for the 
petitioner as narrated in para-1 and direction given in para-2 of the 
order. This Court in a case titled “MUHAMMAD SAQLAIN V. THE 
STATE, ETC.” (2023 LHC 6699), observed as under: 
 
“So, in other words, the order “learned counsel for the 
petitioner wishes to withdraw this petition after arguments.  
Disposed of accordingly” means that subject petition terminated, 
settled, ended, concluded or closed as desired by the learned 
counsel for the petitioner after arguments and consideration of 
the merits of the case.” 
  
12. 
It can safely be concluded that this Court while transmitting 
the petition along with its annexures directed the SECP to decide the 
same in accordance with law i.e. in terms of Section 265 of the 
Ordinance, 1984.  
13. 
In the light of observations made hereinabove, respondent 
No.1 has rightly passed the impugned order by appointing the 
Chartered Accountant as Inspector in terms of Section 265 of the 
Ordinance, 1984. The contention raised by the learned counsel for 
the petitioners has no force. He failed to point out any illegality, 

W.P. No.8594 of 2016/BWP.

irregularity or jurisdictional defect on the part of respondent No.1 
while passing the impugned order.  
14.  
Epitome of above discussion is that this writ petition having 
no merits is hereby dismissed.
