For ease of reference, in W. P. No. 28679 / 2023 Petitioners 
No. 1 and 2, who are joint venture partners, shall hereinafter be collectively 
referred to as the “Petitioner No. 1”.  The Petitioner in W. P. No. 33077 /

be collectively referred to as the “Petitioners”.   
3. 
 
The facts of the titled Petitions are that the Program 
Monitoring & Implementation Unit, Punjab Education Sector Reform 
Program (the “PMIU”) constituted and functioning under the School 
Education Department of the Government of the Punjab published two

W. P. No. 28679 / 2023 
W. P. No. 33077 / 2023 
 
 
separate advertisements dated 01.11.2021 and 01.12.2021 for procurement 
of 3,250 and 12,500 PC Tablets, respectively through a Single Stage, Two 
Envelope bidding procedure in terms of the Punjab Procurement 
Regulatory Authority Act, 2009 (the “Act”) and the Punjab Procurement 
Rules, 2014 (the “Rules”) and in accordance with the World Bank’s 
Procurement Regulations for IPF Borrowers Fourth Edition November 
2020. Petitioner No. 1 participated in the procurement process and 
submitted technical and financial proposals. The bids of Petitioner No. 1 
were accepted by PMIU after due process of law being the technically 
qualified lowest bidder. Accordingly, contract dated 27.12.2021 for Rs. 
159,210,675/- (the “First Contract”) and contract dated 07.01.2022 for Rs. 
612,348,750/ (the “Second Contract”) were duly awarded. Petitioner No. 
1 duly performed the First Contract, raised an invoice of the contract price 
on 08.02.2022 and received complete consideration vide cross cheque 
dated 24.02.2022. As such, the procurement against the First Contract was 
successfully concluded. Likewise, Petitioner No. 1 duly performed the 
Second Contract and raised invoice of the contract price on 04.04.2022. 
However, the payment was not made in terms of Clause 16 of General 
Clauses and Special Conditions of the Second Contract read with Rule 62 
of the Rules within 30 days from the date of completion of the Second 
Contract which prompted Petitioner No. 1 to issue reminder letters dated 
16.05.2022 and 21.06.2022. At this juncture, PMIU instead of making 
payment started pressurizing and intimidating Petitioner No. 1 for rebate of 
15% not only against the Second Contract but also at the same rate against 
the First Contract although payment against the latter had already been 
received. It is alleged that Petitioner No. 1 was coerced to accept the 
unlawful demand of rebates with the threat that payment against the 
Second Contract would not be timely processed and the funds would be left 
to lapse on 30.06.2022 causing inordinate delay in payment. It is the case 
of Petitioner No. 1 that supplied PC Tablets had been procured from the 
foreign manufacturer ‘Lenovo’ for onward supply to PMIU in Dollar 
terms. The Dollar and Rupee parity was drastically changing to the 
detriment of Petitioner No. 1 which is depicted from the fact that Pakistani 

3 
W. P. No. 28679 / 2023 
W. P. No. 33077 / 2023 
 
 
Rupee from 176 / Dollar on the date of execution of the Second Contract 
had depreciated to Rs. 213 / Dollar on 21.06.2022 and Petitioner No 1 who 
had to make timely outstanding payments to the foreign manufacturer 
reached at the brink of default. Under these circumstances, Petitioner No. 1 
was forced to issue a revised invoice granting rebates of 15% against the 
agreed contract prices of the First Contract and the Second Contract 
evidenced from letter dated 24.06.2022, whereafter, Petitioner No. 1 was 
made payment through cross cheque on 27.06.2022 with respect to the 
Second Contract. Petitioner No. 1 promptly recorded objections regarding 
the forcible deduction of rebates reserving right to initiate appropriate legal 
proceedings on the same date i.e. 27.06.2022 by expressly mentioning that 
as per the terms of the First Contract and the Second Contract, the agreed 
contract prices could not be varied. To enforce the claim, Petitioner No. 1 
filed W. P. No. 49661 / 2022 before this Court seeking payment of forcibly 
deducted rebates which was disposed of vide order dated 27.10.2022 with a 
direction to Secretary, Schools Education Department to decide the same 
through a speaking order in accordance with law. Non-compliance of the 
direction of this Court led to the institution of Criminal Original No. 4668 / 
2023, whereafter, the impugned Order dated 12.01.2023 was passed 
declaring therein that the amount of rebates cannot be paid as the same 
were ‘voluntarily’ surrendered by Petitioner No. 1.   
4. 
 
Similarly, two separate procurements of 4467 and 3400 Early 
Childhood Education (ECE) kits (having 84 items in each kit) were 
finalized by PMIU in favor of Petitioner No. 2 being technically qualified 
lowest bidder after following due process of law. Accordingly, contract 
dated 19.11.2021 was duly executed for the procurement of 4467 ECE kits 
against the contract price of Rs. 265,563,150/- (the “Third Contract”) and 
contract dated 29.11.2021 was duly executed for the procurement of 3400 
ECE kits against the contract price of Rs. 203,272,400/- (the “Fourth 
Contract”). Petitioner No. 2 duly performed the Third Contract and the 
Fourth Contract and raised invoices for payments which were not paid 
within the stipulated period of 30 days. The fact of non-payment was 
reinforced through a number of reminders. At this juncture, Petitioner No. 

4 
W. P. No. 28679 / 2023 
W. P. No. 33077 / 2023 
 
 
2 was coerced to grant 20% rebate under the threat that the payments shall 
not be timely processed leaving the funds to lapse at the end of the 
financial year and Petitioner No. 2 would have to suffer for months for 
receiving due payments. Accordingly, Petitioner No. 2 in view of 
depreciating value of rupee and in order to make timely payments to its 
foreign supplier, was forced to give rebate of 20%, whereafter, substantial 
payments were released except partial amount of Rs. 32,638,050/- against 
invoice No. 2979 dated 28.11.2022. Petitioner No. 2 raised its grievance 
through W. P. Nos. 47967 and 47973 / 2022 before this Court seeking 
payment of forced rebate which were disposed of vide orders dated 
27.10.2022 with a direction to Secretary, Schools Education Department to 
decide the same through a speaking order in accordance with law. Non-
compliance of the said direction of this Court led to the institution of 
Criminal Original No. 6018 / 2023, whereafter, the impugned Order dated 
12.01.2023 was passed declaring therein that the amounts of rebate cannot 
be released having been voluntarily surrendered by Petitioner No. 2. 
5. 
 
Learned counsel for the Petitioners submitted that the 
Petitioners have approached this Court for enforcement of their 
constitutional and statutory rights conferred under the Act and the Rules. 
The impugned Orders speak volumes regarding the decision-making 
process prevalent in Governmental Departments in general and PMIU in 
particular and as such, are not sustainable being in breach of the Rules, 
express terms and conditions of duly performed and concluded contracts, 
unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious and having been passed in colorable 
exercise of authority. The procurements were undertaken within the ambit 
of procurement policies and guidelines of the World Bank. Three inquiries 
regarding all procurement processes in PMIU were undertaken but no 
incriminating evidence was discovered against the Petitioners who were 
made to surrender forced rebate once the products were supplied and the 
contracts were fully performed. PMIU exerted its dominant position to 
extract rebates by withholding payments. As such, PMIU is obligated to 
release the entire contract price of all subject contracts to the Petitioners.

Learned Law Officer relying upon report and para-wise 
comments filed by the Respondents objected to the maintainability of these 
Petitions by submitting that contracts involving factual controversies 
cannot be adjudicated upon in the constitutional jurisdiction by this Court. 
He further stated that the Petitioners had voluntarily surrendered the rebates 
for welfare of the students and therefore, are estopped from challenging the 
same. He further apprised that due to some reports on electronic and print 
media regarding exaggerated prices of procured items by PMIU, an Inquiry 
Committee was constituted on 16.05.2022 to scrutinize various 
procurements including that of the Petitioners. The said Committee 
submitted detailed findings and while highlighting irregularities expressed 
its concern that in procurement processes, some products may have been 
procured at inflated rates. Thereafter, the matter was referred to Anti-
Corruption Establishment which referred the matter back to the Department 
with the recommendation to conduct an internal scrutiny through another 
Scrutiny Committee. The finding and observations given in the Scrutiny 
Committee in its report dated 14.12.2022 are reproduced as under:- 
 “Regarding the rates of items, the Committee is of the view 
that the comparison with prevailing market rates cannot be 
drawn at this stage after a lapse of more than one year, 
especially owing to the fact that most of the procured items 
are imported and the foreign exchange rates have 
considerably risen during the period. However, the 
procurement has been made through competitive bidding 
process as per relevant Rules / Regulations and all the 
contracts were awarded to the lowest evaluated bidders after 
recommendation of the concerned Procurement Committees 
and approval of the Competent Authority by fulfilling all codal 
formalities. Therefore, the observations of higher rates is not 
pertinent to be made at this stage.” 
 
In this context, the Petitioners voluntarily offered rebates which were 
accepted by the Schools Education Department. Hence, the Petitioners 
surrendered part of their respective contract prices voluntarily and as such, 
are not entitled to receive them.

8. 
 
The Act has been promulgated to provide for establishment of 
the Procurement Regulatory Authority to regulate procurement of goods, 
services and works in the public sector and for matters connected thereto. 
The Punjab Procurement Regulatory Authority (the “Authority”) has been 
set up by the Government of the Punjab in terms of Section 3 of the Act for 
carrying out its objective and purposes. The Authority under Section 5 of 
the Act is empowered to take measures and exercise powers as may be 
necessary 
for 
improving 
governance, 
management, 
transparency, 
accountability and quality of public procurement. As such, the Authority 
has been conferred with vast powers to monitor and implement the laws, 
rules, regulations, policies and procedures in respect of or relating to public 
procurement. The Government of the Punjab by following the command of 
Section 26 of the Act has framed the Rules which exhaustively deal with 
all 
aspects 
of 
procurements 
including 
procurement 
planning; 
advertisement; 
prequalification, 
qualification, 
disqualification 
and 
blacklisting of contractors; methods of procurement; acceptance of bids; 
and award of contracts. Rule 4 of the Rules enshrines the principles of 
procurements and stipulates that a procuring agency, while making any 
procurement, shall ensure that the procurement is made in a fair and 
transparent manner, object of procurement brings value for money to the 
procuring agency and the procurement process is efficient and economical. 
Admittedly, the subject matter procurements were undertaken in 
accordance with the provisions of the Act and the Rules after following due 
process of law in terms of procurement planning, advertisement, 
prequalification processes and evaluation of bids as per the bidding 
documents, whereafter, the bids of the Petitioners were accepted being the 
technically qualified lowest bidders and they were awarded procurement 
contracts. The Petitioners duly performed and executed the contracts by 
supplying the requisite number of products in agreed quality and 
specifications within the stipulated time frame. The procurement was 
undertaken from the funds of the procuring agency provided by the World 
Bank and the latter as donor also kept its oversight in the procurement 
process in terms of its applicable guidelines and policies pertaining to 

7 
W. P. No. 28679 / 2023 
W. P. No. 33077 / 2023 
 
 
procurements including its anti-corruption guidelines. Three inquiries 
regarding the overall procurement processes in PMIU were carried out 
during the relevant period which did not point out any specific act of 
corrupt practices on the part of the Petitioners. No specific act was alleged 
which may amount to mis-procurement. There is no adverse finding of the 
Authority on record. The Respondents did not have any grievance with 
respect to the quality of the products supplied by the Petitioners and issued 
overall delivery certificates enabling the Petitioners to submit their final 
bills. There were also no unsettled claims as all the contracts had been fully 
performed with respect to the quantity and quality of the products. The 
aforesaid facts are admitted by the Respondents. As such, after successful 
conclusion of the executed contracts, the Petitioners were entitled for 
payments regarding each completed contract in terms of Rule 62 of the 
Rules which is reproduced as under:- 
“A procuring agency shall make prompt payments to the 
contractor against the invoice or running bill on satisfactory 
performance within the time given in the conditions of the 
contract which shall not exceed thirty days.” 
 
The applicable express general conditions and special conditions of the 
contracts also obligated PMIU to make payment within 30 days from the 
delivery of products with respect to fully performed contracts. 
9. 
 
Therefore, the only point of determination before this Court is 
non-payment of the complete contract price to the Petitioners regarding 
their fully performed contracts. The only defense of the Respondents is that 
the Petitioners had voluntarily given rebates of 15% to 20% while 
receiving their payments, whereas, the Petitioners claimed that they were 
coerced, blackmailed, pressurized and threatened with unspecified delay in 
payments and as such, the rebates were extracted from them by unlawful 
means.  
10. 
 
It is readily discernable from record that in report of the 
Committee constituted on 16.05.2022 to scrutinize the recruitment 
processes, although no specific act of corrupt practice was attributed to the 
Petitioners yet it was merely observed that the quoted prices of products 
seem at higher side and the supplier may reduce the costs incorporated in 

8 
W. P. No. 28679 / 2023 
W. P. No. 33077 / 2023 
 
 
the invoices voluntarily for the educational purposes which may be around 
15% to 20% of total value. Thus, it is evident that the aforesaid observation 
became the basis to coerce the Petitioners to extend rebates to the 
Respondents and in order to extract the same, payments were withheld 
beyond thirty days in violation of expressed provisions of the contracts and 
the Rule cited above. Admittedly, the products were procured in Dollar 
terms from foreign suppliers by the Petitioners who had to make timely 
payments to them. The fact of fast depreciation in the value of Rupee 
against Dollar compounded agony of the Petitioners. The funds were going 
to be lapsed being at the end of financial year which was approaching fast. 
Hence, the threat of delayed payments was extended to the Petitioners as a 
weapon to extract the demanded rebates. This was done at the time when 
the Petitioners had completely performed their respective parts of the 
subject contracts and were helpless against the unlawful demands of 
Government functionaries. This is notwithstanding the fact that in the final 
inquiry report dated 14.12.2022, it was explicitly and manifestly declared 
that ‘no incriminating element has been found in the entire process of this 
recruitment’. It was further observed that the procurement has been made 
through competitive bidding process as per the World Bank Regulations to 
the technically qualified lowest bidders. 
11. 
 
Forced rebates are also evident from the fact that the 
Petitioners were coerced to submit revised invoices by voluntarily reducing 
the agreed contract prices on 24.06.2022, whereafter, the due payments 
minus the rebates were immediately released. This fact also corroborates 
with the assertion of the Petitioners that had they not done so, the funds 
would elapse on 30.06.2022 which would have put them on the brink of 
default. The act of imposition of rebates is also reinforced from the fact that 
the Petitioners immediately initiated legal recourse to recover their full 
contract prices. Threat of coercion was so real that Petitioner No. 1 just to 
get his payment released against the Second Contract was even made to 
extend rebate regarding the First Contract although he had received full 
payment against it and the same had become a past and closed transaction. 
Hence, it is established that there was no legal justification to force the 

9 
W. P. No. 28679 / 2023 
W. P. No. 33077 / 2023 
 
 
Petitioners to give rebates to the tune of 15% to 20% with respect to fully 
executed and duly performed contracts at the time of making payments to 
them. Not only this was an arbitrary, unreasonable and capricious act in 
colorable exercise of authority but surely offended Rule 62 of the Rules 
and express contractual stipulations. It was against the principle of 
transparency enshrined in Rule 4 of the Rules. Needless to emphasize that 
transparency in procurement process not only envisages that procurement 
shall be made through transparent, open and competitive processes at the 
lowest price but also equally safeguards and protects right of the 
technically qualified lowest bidder to receive timely payment against 
successfully performed contract. The mere fact that the payments were not 
made to the Petitioners within thirty days with respect to the Second 
Contract, the Third Contract and the Fourth Contract is sufficient to 
establish that the Petitioners were being pressurized, coerced and 
blackmailed to satisfy the unlawful demand of rebates of the Respondents. 
The rights of the Petitioners after successful performance of their 
respective contracts awarded after due process of law are fully protected in 
terms of Articles 4, 18, 24 and 25 of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and Sections 16 and 23 of the Contract Act, 
1872.  
12. 
 
Before parting with this Judgment, it is also noted that the 
contention of learned Law Officer that this Petition is based on disputed 
facts is misconceived as facts of the case are admitted between the parties 
and the only question of forced or voluntary rebates is readily determinable 
from record in view of breach of specific statutory and contractual 
stipulations mandating timely payments which were withheld to extort 
rebates. Hence, the titled Petitions are maintainable due to lack of disputed 
facts and having been instituted for enforcement of statutory rules in view 
of law laid down in case titled, “Messrs Ramna Pipe and General Mills 
(Pvt.) Limited v. Messrs Sui Northern Gas Pipe Lines (Pvt.) and others” 
(2004 SCMR 1274), wherein, it was held that contracts carrying elements 
of public interest between the functionaries of the State have to be just, fair, 
transparent, reasonable and free of any taint of mala fide which are open 

10 
W. P. No. 28679 / 2023 
W. P. No. 33077 / 2023 
 
 
for judicial review and deviations, if of substance, can be corrected through 
appropriate orders under Article 199 of the Constitution. 
13. 
 
In view of the above, the titled Petitions are allowed and the 
Respondents are directed to forthwith release the complete contract prices 
of the First Contract and the Second Contract to Petitioner No. 1 and of the 
Third Contract and the Fourth Contract to Petitioner No. 2 within a period 
of thirty days from the date of this Judgment. Office shall transmit a 
certified copy of this Judgment to the Authority who is directed to take 
appropriate steps to ensure transparency in public procurements.
