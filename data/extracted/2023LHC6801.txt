Amicus Curiae 
Mr. Faisal Siddiqi, Advocate. 
 
 
                  Raheel Kamran J:- The petitioner has invoked 
jurisdiction of this Court under Article 199 of the Constitution of 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (‘the Constitution’) praying for a 
direction to the Election Commission of Pakistan (‘ECP’) to file 
complaints against all members of National and Provisional 
Assemblies who have not disclosed Toshakhana gifts in their 
statements of assets and liabilities. 
2.      Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the concealment 
of Toshakhana gifts in the statement of assets and liabilities 
constitutes an offence under section 137(4) read with section 167(a) 
of the Elections Act, 2017 (‘the Act’) punishable under section 174 of 

2 
W.P.No.51021 of 2023 
the Act.  He further contends that respondent No.2 has acted in a 
discriminatory manner to file such a complaint only against Imran 
Ahmed Khan Niazi, former Prime Minister of Pakistan, who has been 
convicted and sentenced to undergo three years imprisonment, which 
is in violation of Article 25 of the Constitution as no complaint has 
been filed against other legislators. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the ECP states that the titled writ petition 
is not maintainable inasmuch as complaint against the former Prime 
Minister Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi was filed in response to a 
reference sent by the Speaker of National Assembly under Article 
63(2)(3) of the Constitution whereas no such reference has been 
forwarded against other legislators. He maintains that respondent 
No.2 did not act unfairly and in discriminatory manner as proceedings 
were not initiated under section 137 of the Act.  He further contends 
that since no reference against any other legislator was forwarded by 
the Speaker National Assembly, the Chairman Senate or the Speakers 
of Provincial Assemblies, therefore, complaints were not required to 
be filed against any of them.  He adds that in terms of sub-section (4) 
of section 137 of the Act, the legislators may be proceeded against for 
committing any corrupt practice within 120 days from the date of 
submission of the statement which is found to be false in material 
particulars.  He finally contends that the allegation of mala fide 
attributed to the ECP is patently erroneous and misconceived.  
Learned Law Officer for the Federation has also opposed this petition 
on these grounds. 
4. 
Mr. Faisal Siddiqi Advocate, learned amicus curiae, contends 
that prayer in the titled petition is based on the averments made in 
paragraph No.4 which provides foundation of the claim whereas 
averments made in paragraphs No.5 and 6 depict the superstructure 
built thereon. He maintains that the allegations in paragraph No.5 are 
generic whereas in paragraph No.6, specific allegations have been 
levelled against five particular individuals.  He further contends that 

3 
W.P.No.51021 of 2023 
the titled writ petition is not maintainable for the reasons that firstly, 
the allegations levelled in the instant petition are vague and 
unsubstantiated and secondly, not a single document is appended with 
the petition in support of such allegations.  It is his contention that 
this Court should not entertain such petition containing vague and 
unsubstantiated allegation and reliance in this regard has been placed 
on the case of Ashok Kumar Pandey vs. State of West Bangal and 
others (AIR 2004 Supreme Court 280) wherein the Indian Supreme 
Court has held that when there is material to show that a petition 
styled as a public interest litigation is nothing but a camouflage to 
foster personal disputes, the same is to be thrown out; it should not be 
misunderstood as Publicity Interest Litigation or Private Interest 
Litigation or Politics Interest Litigation and of late Praise Income 
Litigation; such petition cannot be entertained on speculative 
foundations, premises and to make roving enquiry and the petitioner 
has no locus standi to file public interest litigation as a public spirited 
citizen.  He adds that the petitioner has alternate remedy of filing 
complaint under section 190(2) of the Act.  According to him, the 
petitioner is sure about five specific individuals mentioned in 
paragraph No.6 of the petition against whom he has an alternate 
remedy provided by law i.e. complaint under section 190(2) of the 
Act. To substantiate his plea, reliance has been placed on the case of 
Mian Najibuddin Owaisi vs. Aamir Yar and others (PLD 2011 
Supreme Court 1) wherein it was held by the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan that under section 94 of the Representation of People Act, 
1976 a private individual could lodge complaint against any person 
for being involved in the corrupt practice. He finally contends that 
challenging prosecution on the ground of discrimination is not a valid 
defence to absolve of an accused from any criminal liability who is 
answerable for his own act and has to defend himself in a trial. In 
support of such contention, reliance has been placed on the case of 
Malik Din vs. Chairman National Accountability Bureau and another 
(2019 SCMR 372).

  Heard.  Record perused. 
6. 
In order to properly appreciate respective contentions of 
learned counsel for the parties and the amicus curiae, it would be 
advantageous to reproduce section 137 of the Elections Act, 2017 
which reads as follows: - 
“137.  Submission of statement of assets and liabilities.-(1) Every 
Member of an Assembly and Senate shall submit to the 
Commission, on or before 31st December each year, a copy of his 
statement of assets and liabilities including assets and liabilities of 
his spouse and dependent children as on the preceding thirtieth day 
of June on Form B. 
(2) The Commission, on the first day of January each year 
through a press release, shall publish the names of Members who 
failed to submit the requisite statement of assets and liabilities 
within the period specified under sub-section (1) 
(3) The Commission shall, on the sixteenth day of January, 
by an order suspend the membership of a Member of an Assembly 
and Senate who fails to submit the statement of assets and liabilities 
by the fifteenth day of January and such Member shall cease to 
function till he files the statement of assets and liabilities. 
(4) Where a Member submits the statement of assets and 
liabilities under this section which is found to be false in material 
particulars, he may, within one hundred and twenty days from the 
date submission of the statement, be proceeded against for 
committing the offence of corrupt practice.”   
 
From perusal of section 137(1) of the Act, it is abundantly clear that 
an obligation has been cast upon every Member of an Assembly and 
Senate to submit to the ECP, on or before 31st December each year, a 
copy of his statement of assets and liabilities including assets and 
liabilities of his spouse and dependent children as on the preceding 
30th day of June. Failure to submit the aforementioned statement of 
assets and liabilities by 15th January renders the Member of an 
Assembly or Senate dysfunctional and such penal consequences, as 
provided in section 137(3) of the Act, which makes the requirement 
to file the statement clearly mandatory.  It is noteworthy that no 
offence is prescribed under section 137 of the Act to criminalize 
failure to file the statement of assets and liabilities.  Section 137(4) of 
the Act, however, prescribes it to be an offence of corrupt practice 

5 
W.P.No.51021 of 2023 
where a Member of Assembly or Senate submits statement of assets 
and liabilities which is found to be false in material particulars and 
the same is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may 
extend to three years or with fine which may extend to one hundred 
thousand rupees or with both, under section 174 of the Act. A 
limitation period to prosecute for the offence of corrupt practice has 
also been prescribed under section 137(4) of the Act to be 120 days 
from the date of submission of statement of assets and liabilities 
under the said section which is found to be false in material 
particulars.  The object of prescribing period of limitation for the 
offence of corrupt practice under section 137(4) of the Act is to 
quicken the prosecution of complaints and to rid criminal justice 
system of inconsequential cases displaying lethargy, inertia or 
indolence and to make it more orderly, efficient and just.   
7. 
The cognizance and trial of an offence under the Act is 
governed by the provisions of section 190 of the Act.  Section 190(2) 
of the Act provides that proceedings against a person involved in 
corrupt or illegal practice may be initiated on a complaint made by a 
person or the Commission.  For ready reference said section is 
reproduced hereunder: - 
“190. Cognizance and trial.—(1) Notwithstanding anything 
contained in any other law but subject to section 193, an offence 
under this Chapter shall be tried by the Sessions Judge and any 
aggrieved person may, within thirty days of the passing of the final 
order, file an appeal against the order in the High Court which 
shall be heard by a Division Bench of the High Court.  
(2) The proceedings against a person for being involved in 
corrupt or illegal practice may be initiated on a complaint made 
by a person or by the Commission but if a complaint made by the 
person proves to be false, based on bad faith or is made for any 
ulterior motive to provide benefit to another person, the 
complainant shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term 
which may extend to six months or with fine which may extend to 
fifty thousand rupees or with both.  
(3) The Commission may direct that the summary trial of an 
offence under this Act may be conducted in accordance with the 
provisions of Chapter XX of the Code.  

6 
W.P.No.51021 of 2023 
Explanation.—In this section, “Sessions Judge” includes an 
Additional Sessions Judge.”  
 
Even under section 94 of Representation of the People Act, 1976 an 
individual could lodge complaint against a person in respect of 
offences made cognizable under section 82 of the said Act.  Reliance 
in this regard is placed on the case of Mian Najibuddin Owaisi vs. 
Aamir Yar and others (PLD 2011 Supreme Court 1).   
8. 
Jurisdiction of this Court under Article 199 of the Constitution 
is subject to limitations specified therein.  A High Court may exercise 
jurisdiction under the said Article where it is satisfied that no other 
adequate remedy is provided by law to any aggrieved party for 
redressal of its grievance raised in his petition.  In the instant case, the 
applicable law i.e. section 190 of the Act provides remedies of 
complaint before the Sessions Judge and appeal before the High 
Court.  Thus, adequate alternate remedy of complaint is available to 
the petitioner because of which this writ petition is not maintainable. 
Reliance in this regard is placed on the judgments of the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in the cases of Muhammad Salman vs. Naveed 
Anjum (2021 SCMR 1675), Rana Aftab Ahmad Khan vs. Muhammad 
Ajmal and another (PLD 2010 Supreme Court 1066) and 
Federation of Pakistan and others vs. Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif 
and others (PLD 2009 Supreme Court 644).  
9. 
Much emphasis has been laid on the alleged discriminatory act 
of ECP for only proceeding against the former Prime Minister of 
Pakistan namely Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi, however,  the said 
respondent has refuted such allegation. It is case of the ECP that there 
is no discrimination inasmuch as criminal proceedings against the 
above-named former Prime Minister were not initiated on its own 
rather on a reference forwarded by the Speaker of National Assembly 
under Article 63(2)(3) of the Constitution on the question of his 
disqualification as Member of National Assembly moved by six 
Members of the National Assembly whereas no such reference has 

7 
W.P.No.51021 of 2023 
been forwarded against any other Member. Be that as it may, validity 
of prosecution and conviction of the above-named former Prime 
Minister of Pakistan is a matter for consideration of the Court of 
competent jurisdiction where his appeal against conviction and 
sentence is pending. As far as this Court is concerned, in view of the 
adequate alternate remedy of complaint provided by law to the 
petitioner under section 190(2) of the Act, there exists no occasion for 
this Court to issue a writ in the nature of mandamus on any ground 
whatsoever. 
10. 
For the foregoing reasons, this petition sans merit and is 
accordingly dismissed.
