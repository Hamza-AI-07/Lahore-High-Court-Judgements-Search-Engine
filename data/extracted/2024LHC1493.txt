Petitioner by :   
Mr. Muhammad Mumtaz Faridi,

Respondent No.1 by: Mr. Allah Ditta Naseem, Advocate.  
 
  
 
 
 
MASUD ABID NAQVI, J:   Brief facts of this writ petition are that 
petitioner/ father filed an application under Section 25 of the 
Guardians & Wards Act , 1890 (“Act”) for custody of the minor 
namely Marosh Hassan, which was contested by respondent No.1/ 
mother by filing reply and raising certain legal as well as factual 
objections. Out of divergent pleadings of both the parties, issues were 
framed by the learned Guardian Court. Thereafter, on 10.06.2020, the 
petitioner/father appeared before the learned Guardian Court and got 
recorded his statement which is reproduced hereunder:- 
“stated that if schedule of the minor’s meeting with me as a 
real father be fixed by the Court then I would not be having any 
objection if the instant petition for custody of the minor be 
dismissed as withdrawn.”

Learned Guardian Court issued a schedule of meeting with 
minor and dismissed the petition as withdrawn vide order dated 
10.06.2020. Feeling aggrieved, respondent No.1 filed an appeal and 
learned Additional District Judge, Pakpattan vide judgment dated 
31.05.2021 partially allowed the appeal and issued new schedule for 
visitation of minor with the petitioner/father. Being dissatisfied, the 
petitioner/father has filed the instant writ petition and challenged the 
validity of impugned judgment passed by the learned Appellate Court. 
 
2. 
During arguments, learned counsel for the petitioner has shown 
no objection on certain amendments in the order of learned Guardian  
Court, under instructions, while learned counsel for respondent No.1 
fully supports the impugned judgment, passed by learned Appellate 
Court with the arguments that the petitioner/ father is living alone 
without any female in the house and will not properly maintain his ten 
years old minor daughter and the respondent No.1/mother seriously 
apprehends that overnight stay will be misused by the petitioner/father 
in removing the minor from the jurisdiction of the learned Guardian 
Court but also acknowledges that the petitioner/ father is paying the 
maintenance of minor without any arrears at this moment. On query, 
learned counsel for the petitioner, under instructions of petitioner 
present in the court, fully assures this Court that the petitioner will 
never ever remove the minor from the jurisdiction of the learned 
Guardian Court. I have heard the arguments of the learned counsels 
for the parties and perused the available record as well as have 
minutely gone through the impugned judgment.

Perusal of record reveals that after recording the statement of 
the petitioner/father, the learned Guardian Court dismissed the 
application under Section 25 of the Guardians & Wards Act , 1890 as 
withdrawn and also issued a schedule of visitation, which is 
reproduced hereunder: -

of surety bonds to the tune of Rs.700,000/- and fee 
payable to the bailiff by the petitioner. 
 
 
 
Learned Appellate Court partially accepted the appeal of 
respondent No.1/mother and new schedule for visitation of minor with 
respondent was framed, which is reproduced hereunder: - 
(i) 
The interim custody of the minor will be handed 
over to the respondent (father) on first Saturday of

return the interim custody of the minor to the 
appellant (mother) on the same day at 1:00 p.m. 
This meeting would be happened in the visitation 
room established inside the court premises. 
 
(ii) 
On second day of every Eid, at 11:00 a.m the 
custody of minor will be handed over to the 
respondent. And he will return her custody to 
appellant at 3:00 p.m on the same day subject to 
furnishing surety bond of Rs.10,00,000/-. Surety 
will be responsible for safe custody of minor and

(iv) 
The respondent (father) will visit the minor during

(v) 
All the above said meetings will be subject to 
submission of surety bonds to the tune of 
Rs.10,00,000/- and fee payable to the bailiff by the

4. 
It is a settled proposition of law that a non-custodial parent has 
all the rights to meet his/her children and neither right of access to 
his/her minor children can be denied nor a non-custodial parent will 

W.P.No.46618 of 2021 
5 
 
 
 
be considered as an alien to his/her children. A minor not only needs 
love, affection, care and attention of a mother but also the father and 
negating a non-custodial parent of his/her right to meet his/her minor 
children would lead to emotional deprivation. A non-custodial parent 
has an inherent right to effectively participate in upbringing of minor 
and that cannot be achieved without properly chalked visitation 
schedule. Due to lack of interaction with non-custodial parent, the 
children start forgetting and in many cases disliking the non-custodial 
parent and this phenomenon has been named as Parental Alienation 
Syndrome by the psychiatrists. Hence, visiting schedule significantly 
bridges a relationship between the minor children and a non-custodial 
parent. Using visitation rights, a non-custodial parent can not only 
recolour the emotions of minor children for him/her but also 
reinvigorate the bond of love and affection with minor.  
5. 
Although, the law on the subject of visitation is contained in the 
Guardian & Wards Act (VIII of 1890) but without any guidelines 
about the duration, frequency of those visits of minor and about the 
visitation schedule, hence, while deciding about the visitation 
schedule, the paramount consideration is the welfare of minor.  
Considering the paramount consideration of welfare of minor and in 
view of the dictum laid down by the Honorable Superior Courts about 
chalking the visitation schedule of minor, especially the case reported 
as Mst. Madiha Younus Vs Imran Ahmed (2018 SCMR 1991), the 
petitioner is entitled to meet with his daughter/ minor as per new 
visitation schedule which is reproduced hereunder;  

W.P.No.46618 of 2021 
6 
 
 
 
(i) 
The interim custody of the minor will be handed 
over to the petitioner (father) on first Saturday of 
every Calendar month at 5:00 pm and respondent 
shall return the interim custody of the minor to the 
respondent (mother) on first Sunday at 3:00 pm. 
 
(ii) 
On the second day of Eid-ul-Fitar the petitioner 
(father) shall be entitled for interim custody of the 
minor from 5:00 pm and petitioner shall return the 
interim custody of the minor to the respondent 
(mother) on the 3rd day of Eid-ul-Fitar at 3:00 pm. 
 
(iii) On the second day of Eid-ul-Azha the petitioner 
(father) shall be entitled for interim custody of the 
minor from 5:00 pm and petitioner shall return the 
interim custody of the minor to the respondent 
(mother) on the 3rd day of Eid-ul-Azha at 3:00 p.m. 
 
(iv) 
On the occasion of birthday of the minor, the 
petitioner (father) shall be entitled for interim 
custody of the minor from 4:00 pm and petitioner 
shall return the interim custody of minor to 
respondent (mother) on the same day of birthday 
of the minor at 8:00 pm. 
 
(v) 
During summer vacations, the interim custody of 
the minor shall be handed over to the petitioner/ 
father on the 1st Sunday of the summer vacations 
so declared by the School/Government and shall 
be returned to the respondent/mother by the 
petitioner after two weeks of minor’s stay with him 
& during winter vacations the interim custody of 
the 
minor 
shall 
be 
handed 
over 
to 
the 
petitioner/father for just first three days of the 

W.P.No.46618 of 2021 
7 
 
 
 
winter vacations and thereafter, minor shall be 
returned to the respondent/mother. 
 
(vi) 
All the above said meetings will be subject to 
submission of surety bonds to the tune of 
Rs.1000,000/- (rupees ten lacs only) by the 
petitioner/father to the satisfaction of the learned 
guardian court prior to receiving the minor from 
respondent/mother and also surrendering his 
international valid passport during the minor’s stay 
with him and by paying fee payable to the court’s 
bailiff by the petitioner. 
 
6. 
In view of above discussion, instant petition is partly allowed 
by setting aside the impugned judgment of learned Appellate Court 
and by also amending the visitation schedule, chalked out by the 
learned Guardian Court.
