Mr. Tariq Mehmood Dogar, Advocate for the 
appellant. 
Mr. Khalid Masood Ghani, AAG. 
     This order shall dispose of I.C.A. No. 268 of 
2024 along with the titled appeal as similar 
questions of law and facts are involved. 
2. 
Through these Intra Court Appeals, the 
appellant has called in question consolidated 
order dated 31.10.2024 passed by learned Single 
Judge-in-Chambers, 
whereby 
constitutional 
petitions (W.P. Nos.3093 and 3897 of 2024) filed 
by the appellant were dismissed. 
3. 
Main grievance raised by the appellant 
against impugned orders is that caretaker 
Government was not authorized to issue contract 
to collect toll tax and toll plazas have been 
established 
at 
distances 
between 
10-20 
kilometers in violation of paragraph No.16 of 
NHA Tolling Policy issued under National 
Highway Authority Act, 1991 which provides for 
distance of 35-60 kilometers between each 
successive toll plaza on the road and is also 
beyond the power vested under Section 3 of the 
Punjab Tolls on Road and Bridges Ordinance, 
1962. 

ICA No.267/2024

4. 
The Section 3 and 4 of The Punjab Toll on 
Roads and Bridges Ordinance, 1962 empowers 
the Government of Punjab to levy toll tax on 
roads and bridges for the purpose of its 
maintenance and Section 10(2) of National 
Highway Authority Act, 1991 authorizes the 
framing of policy for charging toll tax, hence, 
there is no violation of law to that extent. 
5. 
On inquiry respondents have informed us 
that not only toll plaza has been established but 
the contract for collection of toll has also been 
awarded. It has been noticed by this Court that 
although proceedings were initiated by the 
caretaker Government but the same were 
finalized when the elected Government was 
holding the office, which not only issued the 
contract but impliedly endorsed the action of 
caretaker Government for creation of toll plaza 
and leasing out rights for collection of toll and 
this was purely a policy decision, which cannot 
be interfered by this Court unless shown to be 
suffering from any illegality or violation of law, 
which has not been shown from the record.  
6. 
As regards the claim of the appellant that the 
distance between successive toll plazas is 10-20 
kilometers which was violation of paragraph 
No.16 of NHA Tolling Policy reproduced below: 
“Interval between Toll Plazas (Open tolling)  
16. The distance between two successive toll plazas 
on national highways, strategic roads should be 35 
to 60 Km depending upon the traffic volume, traffic 
density and prevailing highway capacity. The toll 
plaza should be placed keeping in view that no 
diversions or loops are available from where traffic 
can take a detour. However, toll plazas should be 
provided on every entry/exit point on a closed loop 
tolling system regardless of any fixed distance. 
NHA may also levy toll on bridges and tunnels, etc, 
besides toll collection on national highways, 
strategic roads & motorways. For this, minimum 

ICA No.267/2024 
                        
 
3
distance requirement as stated earlier for national 
highways should not be considered.” 
 
Suffice it to observe that the afore-referred 
paragraph while providing minimum distance for 
establishment of toll plazas also provides 
exceptions where requirement of minimum 
distance is not to be considered. In the present 
case the ground that toll plazas established at 
lesser distances 
without there 
being any 
supporting material to show that whether the case 
falls within the exception or not is a factual 
controversy requiring determination of disputed 
facts, which is not permissible in constitutional 
jurisdiction of this Court and, hence, we are not 
inclined to pass any direction regarding afore-
referred aspect of the matter which grievance, if 
advised, may be raised before any appropriate 
forum. 
7. 
In view of the above, this appeal failing to 
disclose any illegality or jurisdictional defect in 
the impugned order does not warrant interference 
by this Court and is dismissed accordingly.
