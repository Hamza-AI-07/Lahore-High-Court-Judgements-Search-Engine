Mr. Abdul Rauf Wattoo, DPG with Faisal, SI.   
Ch. Zeeshan Afzal Hashmi, Advocate for the 
complainant.  
   
 
Through this petition filed under section 497, 
Cr.P.C., the petitioner, entreats post-arrest bail in case 
FIR No. 1508, dated 28-09-2023 for offences under 
sections 302, 148, 149, 109 and 311, PPC registered at 
Police Station Dhully, District Gujranwala.   
 
2. 
Tersely, facts of the case are that complainant was 
resident of Dhullay wala and labourer by profession. The 
brother of the complainant namely Zaigham Abbas 
contracted love marriage with Mst. Laiba Bibi daughter 
of Muhammad Sabir 19/20 days prior to the occurrence, 
due to which, family members of Mst. Laiba Bibi were 
annoyed. On 27.09.2023 at about 07.00 p.m. Kaneez 
Bibi, mother of Laiba, came to the house of complainant 
party and stated that she has convinced her family 
members qua marriage of Mst. Laiba Bibi, therefore, they 
are invited on feast tomorrow at her home, upon which, 
the complainant and her family members went to the 
house of Mst. Kaneez Bibi on 28.09.2023 at 12.45 p.m. 
She (Kaneez Bibi) made sitting arrangements of the 
complainant, her father, maternal uncle and cousin in the 
courtyard, whereas, Naseem Akhtar, Zaigham Abbas and 

2 
Crl.Misc. No.5564-B of 2024  
 
 
 
 
Laiba Bibi sat in the room. The accused Muhammad 
Sabir, Kaneez Bibi and Balqees Bibi were already 
present in the room. In the meantime, after almost ten 
minutes, petitioner’s co-accused namely Muhammad 
Usman and Muhammad Arslan armed with 30 bore 
pistols come down from the stairs, upon which, the 
petitioner and her co-accused namely Muhammad Sabir 
and Kinza Bibi chanted lalkara that they be done to death 
and nobody should be let alive, whereupon, Usman and 
Arslan co-accused of the petitioner made straight firing 
upon Naseem Akhtar, Zaigham Abbas and Mst. Laiba 
Bibi. Upon receipt of injuries they all fell down and 
breathed their last at the spot. The accused decamped 
from the spot while brandishing their weapons. Hence 
this case.     
 
3. 
It is contended by learned counsel for the 
petitioner that only joint lalkara is attributed to the 
petitioner. The petitioner is a woman aged about 50 years 
and has been involved in this case by widening the net.  
 
4. 
Conversely, learned Deputy Prosecutor General 
assisted by learned counsel for the complainant argued 
that the petitioner is nominated in the FIR with the active 
role of hurling commanding lalkara. Three innocent 
persons have been done to death in this case. The 
petitioner is involved in a heinous offence and has been 
found fully involved in the commission of crime, during 
the course of investigation, for the reason she is not 
entitled for the relief of bail after arrest.    
 
 
5. 
I have heard learned counsel for the petitioner, as 
well as, learned Deputy Prosecutor General assisted by 

3 
Crl.Misc. No.5564-B of 2024  
 
 
 
 
learned counsel for the complainant at length and perused 
the record minutely with their able assistance.  
 
6. 
After going through the narration of FIR and the 
evidentiary material collected by police and presented 
before this Court, it divulges that the petitioner has been 
saddled with the responsibility of raising a joint lalkara 
directing her co-accused to kill the complainant party and 
thereafter co-accused of the petitioner namely Usman and 
Arslan made straight firing upon Naseem Akhtar, 
Zaigham Abbas and Mst. Laiba Bibi, causing their death. 
Although tentative assessment of evidence is to be made 
while deciding the bail application and deeper 
appreciation of evidence is not permissible nor desirable 
but the benefit of doubt can be extended in favour of 
accused even at the bail stage. In a pronouncement of 
apex court of our country in case titled as “Resham Khan 
and another vs. The State through Prosecutor General 
Punjab, Lahore and another” (2021 SCMR 2011) has 
held that while granting post arrest bail even the benefit 
of doubt can be extended to the accused. The relevant 
portion of the supra mentioned Order is reproduced 
hereunder:- 
“….The insight and astuteness of further inquiry is 
a question which must have some nexus with the 
result of the case for which a tentative assessment 
of the material on record is to be considered for 
reaching just conclusion. The case of further 
inquiry pre-supposes the tentative assessment 
which may create doubt with respect to the 
involvement of accused in the crime. It is well 
settled that object of trial is to make an accused to 
face the trial and not to punish an under trial 
prisoner. The basic idea is to enable the accused to 
answer criminal prosecution against him rather 
than to rot him behind the bar. Every accused is 
innocent until his guilt is proved and benefit of 
doubt can be extended to the accused even at bail 
stage if the facts of the case so warrant. The basic 
philosophy of criminal jurisprudence is that the 

4 
Crl.Misc. No.5564-B of 2024  
 
 
 
 
prosecution has to prove its case beyond 
reasonable doubt and this principle applies at all 
stages including pre-trail and even at the time of 
deciding whether accused is entitled to  bail or 
not.…. 
 
Similar view has also been reiterated in the cases 
reported as Muhammad Sarfraz Ansari vs. The State and 
others (PLD 2021 SC 738), Ali Raza vs. The State and 
others (2022 SCMR 1245), Muhammad Arshad vs. The 
State and another (2022 SCMR 1555), Salman Zahid vs. 
The State through P.G. Sindh (2023 SCMR 1140), 
Naveed Sattar vs. The State and others (2024 SCMR 
205) and Fahad Hussain and another vs. The State 
through Prosecutor General Sindh (2023 SCMR 364).      
 
7. 
It has been observed by this Court that according 
to the story of FIR, co-accused Kaneez Bibi called the 
complainant party at her house on the pretext of feast at 
their honour and after their arrival in her house 
approximately after ten minutes occurrence took place. 
As per prosecution case when it was the intention of 
accused party to murder the complainant party then 
prima facie question of hurling joint lalkara does not 
arise because it was rather to alert the complainant party 
to flee away from the place of occurrence. It has been 
well settled by now that while deciding the bail 
application even the merits of the case can be touched 
upon. A reference in this context may be made to the 
cases of “Khair Muhammad and another vs. The State 
through PG Punjab and another” (2021 SCMR 130), 
“Abdul Rehman alias Muhammad Zeeshan vs. The State 
and others” (2023 SCMR 884), “Saeed Zia vs. The State 
and others” (2023 SCMR 1898) and “Rehman vs. The 
State and others” (2023 SCMR 2081).  

5 
Crl.Misc. No.5564-B of 2024  
 
 
 
 
8. 
It is not discernable from the perusal of the F.I.R. 
and evidentiary material collected by the police that co-
accused of the petitioner namely Usman and Arslan 
needed any command of the petitioner to actuate their 
intention of causing death of supra mentioned persons. 
Moreover, it is not the case of prosecution that the 
petitioner facilitated her co-accused in any manner at the 
time of occurrence. Such type of allegation is very easy 
to level but very difficult to prove. The culpability of 
petitioner in the commission of crime will be best 
determined by the learned trial court after recording and 
evaluating the evidence. At this stage case of the 
petitioner squarely falls within the precincts of further 
inquiry as contemplated under sub-section (2) of section 
497, Cr.P.C. A reference in this respect may be made to 
the cases of  Tariq Zia vs. The State (2003 SCMR 958), 
“Qurban Ali vs. The State and others” (2017 SCMR 
279) and Sher Afzal vs. The State and another (2022 
SCMR 186).  
 
9. 
According to the prosecution story the petitioner 
was empty handed and did not make any attempt to cause 
any 
injury 
to 
the 
deceased, 
her 
role 
became 
distinguishable from those who had caused injuries to the 
deceased. Now a days’ it has become a trend of our 
society to falsely involve the entire family by ascribing 
them the role of Lalkara, abetment, Japha and ineffective 
firing. The petitioner and her co-accused are related to 
each other and in that milieu spreading the net wide by 
the complainant party so as to falsely implicate the 
petitioner in the present criminal case appears to be a 
possibility which cannot safely be ruled out of the 
consideration at this stage. Reliance is placed upon the 

6 
Crl.Misc. No.5564-B of 2024  
 
 
 
 
following case laws Malik Waheed alias Abdul Hameed 
vs. The State and another (2011 SCMR 1945), Subeh 
Sadiq alias Saabo alias Kalu vs. The State and others 
(2011 SCMR 1543), Muhammad Shafi and others vs.  
The State and others (2016 SCMR 1593), Abdul Rehman 
alias Muhammad Zeeshan vs The State and others (2023 
SCMR 884) and Ch. Saeed Ahmad Khalid vs. The State 
and others (2023 SCMR 1712).  
 
10. 
 So far as the contention of learned counsel for the 
complainant that the petitioner is vicariously liable for 
the commission of crime is concerned, it is noteworthy 
that question of vicarious liability would only be 
determined by the trial court after having recourse to 
evidence of the parties and bail cannot be withheld as 
punishment when her case squarely falls within the ambit 
of further inquiry. Guidance is hereby sought from the 
following case laws reported as Wajid Ali vs. The State 
and another (2017 SCMR 116) and Muhammad Ameen 
vs. The State and another (2022 SCMR 1444).     
 
11. 
Learned 
Deputy 
Prosecutor 
General 
has 
vociferously argued that it is a triple murder case and the 
offence with which the petitioner has been charged falls 
within the ambit of prohibitory clause of section 497 
Cr.P.C. and it is a heinous offence, for the reason, she is 
not entitled for concession of bail. I am not in agreement 
with this contention because it is well settled proposition 
of law that mere heinousness of offence is no ground for 
declining the relief of bail to an accused, who otherwise 
becomes entitled for the concession of bail. Wisdom is 
derived from the case-law titled as Nasir Khan vs. 
Waseel Gul and another (PLJ 2009 SC 957) wherein it 
was held as under:-  

7 
Crl.Misc. No.5564-B of 2024  
 
 
 
 
 
“No doubt, it is true that respondent is one of the 
accused persons charged in a heinous offence but 
it is equally true that mere heinousness of an 
offence does not disqualify an accused person from 
the relief of bail, if otherwise his case is found fit 
far grant of bail. In the instant case, bail has been 
granted to respondent for cogent and valid reasons 
which are not open to legitimate exception.” 
 
  
Similar view has also taken in the landmark judgment of 
the apex court reported as “Husnain Mustafa v. The State 
and another” (2019 SCMR 1914) wherein it has been 
observed as infra:- 
 
“…Brutality inflicted upon the innocent souls is 
most appalling to say the least, however, in the 
chequered circumstances of the case, what cannot 
be lost sight of is that the complainant, though 
most 
grievously 
aggrieved 
and 
devastated, 
nonetheless, is not eye-witness of the crime; his 
initial belief that the petitioner in connivance with 
his former wife murdered the children is 
essentially structured upon a suspicion; he has 
even recalled a substantial portion thereof while 
exonerating identically placed Aneeqa Rasheed 
before a learned Additional Sessions Judge at 
Lahore on 19-12-2018. Subsequently inducted co-
accused Ayyaz Mehmood, with alleged active 
participation in the crime is on bail. Polygraph 
test, a modern forensic method to unearth the 
truth, may establish a person's capacity to lie, 
however, findings thereof, cannot be equated with 
admission of guilt. Transposition of Aneeqa 
Rasheed as a witness with her failure to prosecute 
the petitioner through a private complaint 
constitutes her departure from the scene and as 
such squarely brings his case within the ambit of 
subsection (2) of section 497 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1898. Statements of Waseem 
Abbas 
and 
Ali 
Zaib 
recorded 
after 
an 
unexplained, 
inordinate 
delay 
also 
require 
evidential verification during the trial. Horrors of 
an heinous crime cannot impede release of 
accused on bail, if otherwise his guilt called for 
further probe nor bail can be withheld as a 
strategy for punishment.   
 
12. 
The petitioner is a fragile creature aged about 50 
years who is behind the bars since 04.12.2023. The 
investigation is already completed and she is no more 

8 
Crl.Misc. No.5564-B of 2024  
 
 
 
 
required by the police for the purpose of investigation. 
Therefore, further incarceration of the petitioner would 
not be lucrative to the prosecution. Moreover, liberty of a 
person is a precious right, which cannot be taken away 
unless there are exceptional grounds to do so. Merely on 
the basis of bald allegations, the liberty of a person 
cannot be curtailed as observed in the cases reported as 
Muhammad Nawaz alias Karo vs. The State (2023 
SCMR 734) and Noor Kamal and another vs. The State 
and another (2023 SCMR 999).  
 
13. 
Aftermath of above said discussion is that 
petitioner has succeeded in making out the case of bail, 
resultantly, this petition is hereby accepted and the 
petitioner is allowed post-arrest bail subject to his 
furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.5,00,000/- 
(Rupees five hundred thousand only) with two sureties in 
the like amount to the satisfaction of the learned trial 
Court. 
 
14. 
Needless to observe that the observations made 
hereinabove are only tentative in their nature and would 
not influence the case of any party at the time of trial.
