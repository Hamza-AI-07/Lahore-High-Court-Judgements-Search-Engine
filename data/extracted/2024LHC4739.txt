Through this petition filed under Section 497 Cr.P.C., the 
petitioner seeks his post-arrest bail in case FIR No.52/2024, dated 
13.06.2024, offence under Section 9(2)-9 of the Control of 
Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 (hereinafter ‘the CNSA’) registered 
with Police Station A.N.F. Lahore.  
2. 
According to the crime report, upon receiving 
information from the Branch Manager of DHL Worldwide 
Express, an A.N.F. raiding team visited the office, where the 
Manager handed over a parcel to the complainant. This parcel 
had been booked by the petitioner for delivery to New Zealand. 
Upon inspection of the parcel, a quilt cover, bed sheet, cushion 
covers, oblong cushion covers, pillow covers, fabric, and cotton 
were found, all of which were allegedly soaked with 
methamphetamine (herein after “Ice”). The combined weight of 
these items was 12 kilograms.  
3. 
Arguments heard and the record perused. 
4. 
The recovered clothing items were sent to the Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) for analysis to detect the 
presence of the alleged psychotropic substance. The PFSA 

Crl. Misc. No.60701-B of 2024 
2 
 
report reveals that, out of the twelve clothing items, only four 
contain Ice. Although the forensic report confirms that the four 
clothing items were saturated with the psychotropic substance 
known as Ice, it does not include a quantitative analysis to 
determine the exact amount of Ice present. This omission leaves 
the precise quantity of the psychotropic substance undetermined. 
Today, the Forensic Scientist from the Narcotics Department of 
the Punjab Forensic Science Agency appeared before the Court 
and submitted his report, which states as follows:  
“The quantity of Methamphetamine (Ice) soaked in 
cloth/cotton could not be determined due to non-
availability 
of 
separation 
facilities 
at 
PFSA 
(Narcotics Department). So, we are unable to 
provide 
the 
actual 
total 
quantity 
of 
Methamphetamine (Ice) in confirmed parcels.”        
5. 
In the context of narcotic substances analysis in Pakistan, 
particularly under the CNSA, the terms qualitative and 
quantitative tests refer to two key aspects of forensic testing 
conducted to determine the nature and quantity of narcotic 
substances in a sample. These tests are typically carried out by 
forensic labs and are crucial for evidence in narcotics cases. A 
qualitative test identifies the specific type of narcotic in a sample, 
confirming whether it is a narcotic drug or psychotropic substance 
under 
CNSA. 
Using 
advanced 
techniques 
such 
as 
chromatography, mass spectrometry, and infrared spectroscopy, 
the test reveals the substance’s unique chemical profile, verifying 
its nature and legality. On the other hand, a quantitative test 
determines the precise concentration of a narcotic in a sample, 
shaping the severity of penalties under the CNSA, where higher 
quantities lead to stringent sentencing. Without a forensic report 
confirming the exact quantity, the prosecution may struggle to 
meet the evidentiary standards required for conviction and 
sentence.

6. 
In the given circumstances, when the report from the 
Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) fails to provide a 
conclusive determination regarding the actual quantity of 
psychotropic substance purportedly absorbed within the clothing 
articles, the case against the petitioner enters the realm of further 
inquiry as envisaged under Section 497 (2) CR.P.C. The 
uncertainty in establishing the precise quantity of the alleged 
recovered psychotropic substance necessitates the recording of 
additional evidence, as the current record remains inconclusive. 
Consequently, this ambiguity warrants judicial scrutiny, leaving 
the matter open to deeper appreciation, an exercise best reserved 
for thorough deliberation at trial. The petitioner has remained in 
custody since his arrest, and his presence is no longer required by 
the investigating agency for further investigation. Thus, detaining 
him indefinitely would serve no meaningful purpose. 
 
7. 
For what has been discussed above, the petition in hand is 
allowed and the petitioner is admitted to post-arrest bail subject to 
his furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.2,00,000/- (rupees two 
lacs only) with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of 
the trial court. However, it is hereby clarified that should the 
petitioner fail to cooperate with the trial court for an expeditious 
conclusion of the trial proceedings, such conduct shall be deemed a 
misuse of the concession of bail. In such an event, the State shall 
have the right to apply for the cancellation of his post-arrest bail.
