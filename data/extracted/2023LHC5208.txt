10.10.2023 Mr. Muhammad Yasir Ibrahim, Advocate for 
the Petitioner. 
M/s Jalil Akhtar Abbasi and Abid Aziz Rajori, 
Assistant Advocates General Punjab (on Court 
call). 
 
 
Through this petition under Article 199 of 
the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973 (the “Constitution”), the Petitioner, PIA 
Officers Cooperative Housing Society Limited 
(the “Society”) has impugned the orders dated 
22.09.2023 and 03.10.2023, passed by Registrar, 
Cooperative Societies Punjab, Lahore and the 
Secretary, Cooperative Department, Government 
of the Punjab, respectively.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the Petitioner has 
iterated the submissions already made by him in 
the writ petition, however, his main contention is 
that both the forums below have not considered the 
provisions of Section 43 of the Cooperative 

2 
W.P.No.3340/2023 
Societies Act, 1925 (the “Act”) in true perspective 
while passing the impugned orders. 
3. 
Learned Law Officer has objected to the 
maintainability of this petition.  
4. 
Arguments heard and record perused. 
5. 
First of all, it would be advantageous to go 
through the provisions contained in Section 43 of 
the Act, which is reproduced hereunder for ready 
reference:- 
“43. Inquiry by Registrar.---(1) The 
Registrar may of his own motion by himself 
or by a person duly authorised by him in 
writing in this behalf hold an inquiry into 
the constitution, working and financial 
condition of a society.  
(2) The Registrar shall hold such an inquiry 
as is contemplated in sub section (1) of this 
section--- 
(a) on the requisition of society, duly 
authorised by rules made in this 
behalf to make such requisition, in 
respect of one of its members, such 
member being itself a society, 
(b) on the application of a majority of 
the Committee of the society, 
(c) on the application of 1/3rd of the 
members of the society.  
(3) All officers and members of the society 
whose affairs are investigated shall furnish 
such information in their possession in 
regard to the affairs of the society as the 
Registrar or the person authorized by the 
Registrar may require.  
(4) The result of any inquiry under this 
section shall be communicated to the society 
whose affairs have been investigated.” 
 
From the above-quoted provision of law, it is 
elucidated that the Respondent No.2 on his own 
motion by himself is empowered, under the 

3 
W.P.No.3340/2023 
law/Act, to hold an inquiry into the constitution, 
working and financial condition of a society. In 
this regard, reliance can be placed on the judgment 
reported as Shahbaz Qalandar Cooperative 
Housing Society Limited through Chairman versus 
Province of Sindh through Secretary Cooperative 
Department and 2 others (2011 CLC 783) holding 
that “the main object and purpose of holding 
inquiry 
is 
to 
check 
whether 
mandatory 
requirements and the working affairs of the 
society are being conducted according to law 
and in the larger interest of the members of the 
society.” In another identical case cited as 
Saddar Cooperative Market Ltd. through 
Honorary Secretary versus Province of Sindh, 
Department of Cooperation and 3 others (2009 
CLC 143) it has been held that Section 43(1) 
gives the power to the Registrar to hold an inquiry 
at his own motion for which no procedure has been 
provided. The impugned order dated 22.09.2023 
does not reflect that the Respondent No.2 has 
exceeded from his powers while dealing with the 
application of the Respondents No.3 to 5 on the 
issue of certain irregularities into the affairs of the 
Society by its Managing Committee. There is 
nothing wrong with the impugned order passed by 
the Respondent No.2 who has issued certain 
directions to the Inquiry Committee in consonance 
with the object of the Act, which has been 
promulgated with the only intent to facilitate 
formation and working of Co-operative Societies 
for the promotion of thrift, self-help and mutual 

4 
W.P.No.3340/2023 
aid among agriculturists and other persons with 
common economic needs so as to bring about 
better 
living 
specifically, 
better 
business. 
Interference in such like matters has also been 
declined by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the 
case of Pir Illahi Bukhsh Co-Operative Housing 
Society Ltd., Karachi versus Registrar Co-
Operative Societies, Karachi And Others (1968 
SCMR 423) by discussing the scope of Section 43 
of the Act regarding powers of the Registrar, 
Cooperative Societies, Punjab. 
6. 
As regard the other impugned order dated 
03.10.2023, the same has also validly been passed 
by the Secretary, Cooperatives Department, 
Government of the Punjab/Respondent No.1 in 
terms of Section 64-A of the Act, which reads as 
under:- 
“64A.  Power of Provincial Government 
and the Registrar to call for proceedings of 
Subordinate Officers and to pass orders 
thereon.---The Provision Government and 
the Registrar may call for and examine the 
record of any inquiry or the proceedings of 
any officer subordinate to them for the 
purpose of satisfying themselves as to the 
legality or propriety of any decision or 
order passed and as to the regularity of the 
proceedings of such officer. If in any 
decision or order or proceedings so-called 
for should be modified, annulled or reversed 
the Provincial Government or the Registrar, 
as the case may be, may pass such order 
thereon as to it or him may seem fit.” 
 
It is observed that the order dated 03.10.2023 has 
been passed by the Respondent No.1, being head 
of the Department, strictly as per the power vested 

5 
W.P.No.3340/2023 
on him under the provisions of Section 64-A of the 
Act by rightly declaring that the (aforesaid) 
impugned order of the Respondent No.2 is based 
on sound reasoning and has been passed in 
accordance with law. In his order, Respondent 
No.1 has also observed that proceedings of a fresh 
inquiry into the affairs of the Society cannot be 
stopped because the facts and ground realities had 
been changed with the afflux of time. In addition 
to the powers conferred upon the Respondent No.1 
in terms of Section 64-A of the Act, he is also 
empowered to take cognizance of the matter under 
Rule 3(3) of the Punjab Government Rules of 
Business, 2011 (the “Rules”), which clearly states 
that business of the Government has been 
distributed amongst several Departments in the 
manner indicated in the Second Schedule and 
functions of the Secretary are described under 
Rule 10 of the Rules, which is reproduced 
hereunder for ease of the matter:- 
“10. Functions of the Secretary.– (1) A 
Secretary shall: 
(a) 
be the official head of the 
 
Department 
and 
be 
 
responsible for its efficient 
 
administration and discipline, 
 
for the conduct of business 
 
assigned to the Department 
 
and for the observance of laws 
 
and rules, including these 
 
rules, in the Department;  
(b)  
be responsible to the Minister 
 
for 
the 
business 
of 
the 
 
Department and keep him 
 
informed about the working of 
 
the 
Department, 
and 
of 
 
important cases disposed of 

6 
W.P.No.3340/2023 
 
without 
reference 
to 
the 
 
Minister;  
(c)  
assist the Minister in the 
 
formulation of policy and 
 
bring to the notice of the 
 
Minister cases required to be 
 
submitted to the Chief Minister 
 
under the rules;  
(d) 
execute 
the 
sanctioned 
 
policy;  
(e)  
submit, with the approval 
 
of the  Minister, proposals for 
 
legislation to the Cabinet;  
(f)  
keep 
the 
Chief 
Secretary 
 
informed of important cases 
 
disposed of in the Department;  
(g)  
issue, subject to any general or 
 
special 
orders 
of 
the 
 
Government: 
 
i) 
standing 
orders 
 
specifying the cases or 
 
class of cases which 
 
may be disposed of by 
 
an officer subordinate to 
 
the Secretary; and 
 
ii) specific orders and 
 
instructions 
to 
its 
 
officers for the conduct 
 
of the business assigned 
 
to a local government. 
 
(2) While submitting a case for the 
 
orders of the Minister, the Secretary 
 
shall suggest a definite line of action.  
 
(3) Where the Minister’s orders 
 
appear to contravene any law, rules, 
 
regulations or Government policy, 
 
the Secretary shall resubmit the case 
 
to the Minister inviting his attention 
 
to the relevant law, rules, regulations 
 
or Government policy, and if the 
 
Minister 
disagrees 
with 
the 
 
Secretary, the Minister may refer 
 
the case to the Chief Minister for 
 
orders.” 
 
From the above-quoted provision of the Rules, it 
is clear that Secretary, Cooperatives Department, 

7 
W.P.No.3340/2023 
being official head of the Department, has dealt 
with the matter as per the functions assigned to 
him under Section 64A of the Act read with Clause 
1(a) and Clause 7(i) to Second Schedule of the 
Rules in which he/she also administers the 
provisions of the Cooperative Societies Act, 1925 
alongwith Rule 10 of the Rules, because he/she is 
responsible for efficient and smooth working of 
the affairs of the Society.  
7. 
In view of the above, there is no occasion 
for this Court to interfere with the impugned orders 
dated 22.09.2023 and 03.10.2023 which have 
rightly been passed by the concerned authorities. 
This writ petition fails and is dismissed in limine 
under the Doctrine of Limine Control already 
developed by this Court in the case of Asif Saleem 
versus Chairman BOG University of Lahore and 
others (PLD 2019 Lahore 407).
